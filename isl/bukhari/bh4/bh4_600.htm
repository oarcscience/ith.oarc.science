Allah's Apostle was asked, "Who is the most honorable amongst the 
people?" He replied, "The most Allah fearing." The people said, "We do
not want to ask you about this." He said, "The most honorable person 
is Joseph, Allah's Prophet, the son of Allah's Prophet, the son of 
Allah's Prophet, the son of Allah's Khalil" The people said, 'We do 
not want to ask you about this." He said," Then you want to ask me 
about the origins of the Arabs? People are of various origins. The 
best in the pre-lslamic period are the best in Islam, provided they 
comprehend (the religious knowledge)."
