### Hadith 4:8

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

(the wife of the Prophet) Utba bin Abi Waqqas entrusted (his son) to his
brother Sad bin Abi Waqqas saying, "The son of the slave-girl of Zam'a
is my (illegal) son, take him into your custody." So during the year of
the Conquest (of Mecca) Sad took the boy and said, "This is my brother's
son whom my brother entrusted to me." 'Abu bin Zam's got up and said,
"He is my brother and the son of the slave girl of my father and was
born on my father's bed." Then both of them came to Allah's Apostle and
Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! This is my brother's son whom my brother
entrusted to me."

Then 'Abu bin Zam'a got up and said, "This is my brother and the son of
the slave-girl of my father." Allah's Apostle said, "O Abu bin Zam'a!
This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born),
and for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation)." Then the Prophet
said to his wife Sauda bint Zam'a, "Screen yourself from this boy," when
he saw the boy's resemblance to 'Utba. Since then the boy did not see
Sauda till he died.
