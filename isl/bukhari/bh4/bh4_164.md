### Hadith 4:163

*Narrated Abu Qatada:*

That he was in the company of Allah's Apostle and when they had covered
a portion of the road to Mecca, he and some of the companions lagged
behind. The latter were in a state of Ihram, while he was not. He saw an
onager and rode his horse and requested his companions to give him his
lash but they refused. Then he asked them to give him his spear but they
refused, so he took it himself, attacked the onager, and killed it. Some
of the companions of the Prophet ate of it while some others refused to
eat. When they caught up with Allah's Apostle they asked him about that,
and he said, "That was a meal Allah fed you with." (It is also said that
Allah's Apostle asked, "Have you got something of its meat?")
