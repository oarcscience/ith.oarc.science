### Hadith 4:601

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "May Allah bestow His Mercy on Lot. He wanted to
have a powerful support. If I were to stay in prison (for a period equal
to) the stay of Joseph (prison) and then the offer of freedom came to
me, then I would have accepted it." (See Hadith No. 591)
