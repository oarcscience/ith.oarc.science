### Hadith 4:318

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

We were in the company of the Prophet while returning from 'Usfan, and
Allah's Apostle was riding his she-camel keeping Safiya bint Huyay
riding behind him. His she-camel slipped and both of them fell down. Abu
Talha jumped from his camel and said, "O Allah's Apostle! May Allah
sacrifice me for you." The Prophet said, "Take care of the lady." So,
Abu Talha covered his face with a garment and went to Safiya and covered
her with it, and then he set right the condition of their shecamel so
that both of them rode, and we were encircling Allah's Apostle like a
cover. When we approached Medina, the Prophet said, "We are returning
with repentance and worshipping and praising our Lord." He kept on
saying this till he entered Medina.
