### Hadith 4:392

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

While we were in the Mosque, the Prophet came out and said, "Let us go
to the Jews" We went out till we reached Bait-ul-Midras. He said to
them, "If you embrace Islam, you will be safe. You should know that the
earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle, and I want to expel you from
this land. So, if anyone amongst you owns some property, he is permitted
to sell it, otherwise you should know that the Earth belongs to Allah
and His Apostle."
