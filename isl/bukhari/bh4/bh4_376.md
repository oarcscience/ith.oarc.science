### Hadith 4:372

*Narrated Nafi:*

'Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "O Allah's Apostle! I vowed to observe Itikaf
for one day during the Pre-lslamic period." The Prophet ordered him to
fulfill his vow. 'Umar gained two lady captives from the war prisoners
of Hunain and he left them in some of the houses at Mecca. When Allah's
Apostle freed the captives of Hunain without ransom, they came out
walking in the streets. 'Umar said (to his son), "O Abdullah! See what
is the matter." 'Abdullah replied, "Allah's Apostle has freed the
captives without ransom." He said (to him), "Go and set free those two
slave girls." (Nafi added:) Allah's Apostle did not perform the 'Umra
from Al-Jarana, and if he had performed the 'Umra, it would not have
been hidden from 'Abdullah.
