### Hadith 4:262

*Narrated Jarir:*

Allah's Apostles said to me, "Will you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?
Dhul-Khalasa was a house (of an idol) belonging to the tribe of Khath'am
called Al-Ka'ba Al-Yama-niya. So, I proceeded with one hundred and fifty
cavalry men from the tribe of Ahmas, who were excellent knights. It
happened that I could not sit firm on horses, so the Prophet , stroke me
over my chest till I saw his finger-marks over my chest, he said, 'O
Allah! Make him firm and make him a guiding and rightly guided man.' "
Jarir proceeded towards that house, and dismantled and burnt it. Then he
sent a messenger to Allah's Apostle informing him of that. Jarir's
messenger said, "By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did not come
to you till I had left it like an emancipated or gabby camel (i.e.
completely marred and spoilt)." Jarir added, "The Prophet asked for
Allah's Blessings for the horses and the men of Ahmas five times."
