<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:395</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Asim:</I></P>
I asked Anas about the Qunut (i.e. invocation in the prayer). Anas 
said, "It should be recited before bowing." I said, "So-and-so claims 
that you say that it should be recited after bowing." He replied, "He 
is mistaken." Then Anas narrated to us that the Prophet invoked evil 
on the tribe of Bani-Sulaim for one month after bowing. ' Anas Further
said, "The Prophet had sent 40 or 70 Qaris (i.e. men well versed in 
the knowledge of the Qur'an) to some pagans, but the latter struggled 
with them and martyred them, although there was a peace pact between 
them and the Prophet I had never seen the Prophet so sorry and worried
about anybody as he was about them (i.e. the Qaris)."
