### Hadith 4:270

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

The Prophet said, "Who is ready to kill Ka'b bin Al-Ashraf who has
really hurt Allah and His Apostle?" Muhammad bin Maslama said, "O
Allah's Apostle! Do you like me to kill him?" He replied in the
affirmative. So, Muhammad bin Maslama went to him (i.e. Ka'b) and said,
"This person (i.e. the Prophet) has put us to task and asked us for
charity." Ka'b replied, "By Allah, you will get tired of him." Muhammad
said to him, "We have followed him, so we dislike to leave him till we
see the end of his affair." Muhammad bin Maslama went on talking to him
in this way till he got the chance to kill him.
