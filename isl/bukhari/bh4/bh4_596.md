### Hadith 4:593

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Some people asked the Prophet: "Who is the most honorable amongst the
people?" He replied, "The most honorable among them is the one who is
the most Allah-fearing." They said, "O Allah's Prophet! We do not ask
about this." He said, "Then the most honorable person is Joseph, Allah's
Prophet, the son of Allah's Prophet, the son of Allah's Prophet, the son
of Allah's Khalil." They said, "We do not ask about this." He said,
"Then you want to ask me about the Arabs' descent?" They said, "Yes." He
said, "Those who were best in the pre-lslamic period, are the best in
Islam, if they comprehend (the religious knowledge)."
