### Hadith 4:138

*Narrated Anas:*

I was in the company of Jabir bin 'Abdullah on a journey and he used to
serve me though he was older than I. Jarir said, "I saw the Ansar doing
a thing (i.e. showing great reverence to the Prophet ) for which I have
vowed that whenever I meet any of them, I will serve him."

[Next: 4:139: Anas bin Malik: I went along with the Prophet to Khaibar
so as to serve him. (Later ...](bh4_140)
