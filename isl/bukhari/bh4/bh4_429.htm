<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:425</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
On the day of a solar eclipse, Allah's Apostle stood up (to offer the 
eclipse prayer). He recited Takbir, recited a long recitation (of Holy
Verses), bowed a long bowing, and then he raised h is head saying. 
"Allah hears him who sends his praises to Him." Then he stayed 
standing, recited a long recitation again, but shorter than the 
former, bowed a long bowing, but shorter than the first, performed a 
long prostration and then performed the second Rak'a in the same way 
as he had done the first. By the time he had finished his prayer with 
Taslim, the solar eclipse had been over. Then he addressed the people 
referring to the solar and lunar eclipses saying, "These are two signs
amongst the Signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of 
anyone's death or life. So, if you see them, hasten for the Prayer."
