### Hadith 4:621

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Adam and Moses argued with each other. Moses said
to Adam. 'You are Adam whose mistake expelled you from Paradise.' Adam

the one to whom He spoke directly; yet you blame me for a thing which
had already been written in my fate before my creation?"' Allah's
Apostle said twice, "So, Adam overpowered Moses."
