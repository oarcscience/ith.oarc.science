### Hadith 4:206

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Zaid:*

that in the time (of the battle) of Al-Harra a person came to him and
said, "Ibn Hanzala is taking the pledge of allegiance from the people
for death." He said, "I will never give a pledge of allegiance for such
a thing to anyone after Allah's Apostle."
