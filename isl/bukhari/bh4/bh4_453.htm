That Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani narrated to him something in the 
presence of Said bin 'Ubaidullah Al-Khaulani who was brought up in the
house of Maimuna the wife of the Prophet. Zaid narrated to them that 
Abu Talha said that the Prophet said, "The Angels (of Mercy) do not 
enter a house wherein there is a picture." Busr said, "Later on Zaid 
bin Khalid fell ill and we called on him. To our surprise we saw a 
curtain decorated with pictures in his house. I said to Ubaidullah 
Al-Khaulani, "Didn't he (i.e. Zaid) tell us about the (prohibition of)
pictures?" He said, "But he excepted the embroidery on garments. 
Didn't you hear him?" I said, "No." He said, "Yes, he did."
