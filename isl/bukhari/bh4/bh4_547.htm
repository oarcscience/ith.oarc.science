Allah's Apostle said, "The first group of people who will enter 
Paradise, will be glittering like the full moon and those who will 
follow them, will glitter like the most brilliant star in the sky. 
They will not urinate, relieve nature, spit, or have any nasal 
secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat will smell 
like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their centers. Their wives 
will be houris. All of them will look alike and will resemble their 
father Adam (in statute), sixty cubits tall."
