<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:657</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, surely 
(Jesus,) the son of Mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge 
mankind justly (as a Just Ruler); he will break the Cross and kill the
pigs and there will be no Jizya (i.e. taxation taken from non 
Muslims). Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it, 
and a single prostration to Allah (in prayer) will be better than the 
whole world and whatever is in it." Abu Huraira added "If you wish, 
you can recite (this verse of the Holy Book): -- 'And there is none Of
the people of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians) But must believe in
him (i.e Jesus as an Apostle of Allah and a human being) Before his 
death. And on the Day of Judgment He will be a witness Against them."
