<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:13</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Hakim bin Hizam said, "I asked Allah's </I></P>
Apostle for something, and he gave me, and I asked him again and he 
gave me and said, 'O Hakim! This wealth is green and sweet (i.e. as 
tempting as fruits), and whoever takes it with
<P>
The upper (i.e. giving) hand is better than the lower (i.e. taking) 
hand." Hakim added, "I said, O Allah's Apostle! By Him Who has sent 
you with the Truth I will never demand anything from anybody after you
till I die." Afterwards Abu Bakr used to call Hakim to give him 
something but he refused to accept anything from him. Then 'Umar 
called him to give him (something) but he refused. Then 'Umar said, "O
Muslims! I offered to him (i.e. Hakim) his share which Allah has 
ordained for him from this booty and he refuses to take it." Thus 
Hakim did not ask anybody for anything after the Prophet, till he 
died--may Allah bestow His mercy upon him.
