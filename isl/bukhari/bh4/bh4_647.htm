<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:644</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Ubada:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "If anyone testifies that None has the right to be 
worshipped but Allah Alone Who has no partners, and that Muhammad is 
His Slave and His Apostle, and that Jesus is Allah's Slave and His 
Apostle and His Word which He bestowed on Mary and a Spirit created by
Him, and that Paradise is true, and Hell is true, Allah will admit him
into Paradise with the deeds which he had done even if those deeds 
were few." (Junada, the sub-narrator said, " 'Ubada added, 'Such a 
person can enter Paradise through any of its eight gates he likes.")
