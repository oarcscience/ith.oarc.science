### Hadith 4:108

*Narrated Mu'adh:*

I was a companion rider of the Prophet on a donkey called 'Ufair. The
Prophet asked, "O Mu'adh! Do you know what Allah's right on His slaves
is, and what the right of His slaves on Him is?" I replied, "Allah and
His Apostle know better." He said, "Allah's right on His slaves is that
they should worship Him (Alone) and should not worship any besides Him.
And slave's right on Allah is that He should not punish him who worships

people of this good news?" He said, "Do not inform them of it, lest they
should depend on it (absolutely)."
