Once the Prophet distributed something (among his followers. A man 
said, "This distribution has not been done (with justice) seeking 
Allah's Countenance." I went to the Prophet and told him (of that). He
became so angry that I saw the signs of anger oh his face. Then he 
said, "May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses, for he was harmed more (in
a worse manner) than this; yet he endured patiently."
