### Hadith 4:62

*Narrated Kharija bin Zaid:*

Zaid bin Thabit said, "When the Quran was compiled from various written
manuscripts, one of the Verses of Surat Al-Ahzab was missing which I
used to hear Allah's Apostle reciting. I could not find it except with
Khuzaima bin Thabjt Al-Ansari, whose witness Allah's Apostle regarded as
equal to the witness of two men. And the Verse was:-- "Among the
believers are men who have been true to what they covenanted with
Allah." (33.23)
