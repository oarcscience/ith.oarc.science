### Hadith 4:132

*Narrated Tha'laba bin Abi Malik:*

'Umar bin Al-Khattab distributed some garments amongst the women of
Medina. One good garment remained, and one of those present with him
said, "O chief of the believers! Give this garment to your wife, the
(grand) daughter of Allah's Apostle." They meant Um Kulthum, the
daughter of 'Ali. 'Umar said, Um Salit has more right (to have it)." Um
Salit was amongst those Ansari women who had given the pledge of
allegiance to Allah's Apostle.' 'Umar said, "She (i.e. Um Salit) used to
carry the water skins for us on the day of Uhud."
