<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:7</H3><P><I>Narrated Sad:</I></P>
I fell sick and the Prophet paid me a visit. I said to him, "O Allah's
Apostle! I invoke Allah that He may not let me expire in the land 
whence I migrated (i.e. Mecca)." He said, "May Allah give you health 
and let the people benefit by you." I said, "I want to will my 
property, and I have only one daughter and I want to will half of my 
property (to be given in charity)." He said," Half is too much." I 
said, "Then I will one third." He said, "One-third, yet even one-third
is too much." (The narrator added, "So the people started to will one 
third of their property and that was Permitted for them.")
