### Hadith 4:407

*Narrated Asma 'bint Abi Bakr:*

During the period of the peace treaty of Quraish with Allah's Apostle,
my mother, accompanied by her father, came to visit me, and she was a
pagan. I consulted Allah's Apostle, "O Allah's Apostle! My mother has
come to me and she desires to receive a reward from me, shall I keep
good relation with her?" He said, "Yes, keep good relation with her."
