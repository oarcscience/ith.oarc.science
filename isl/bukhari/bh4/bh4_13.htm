<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:14</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn Umar:</I></P>
I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "All of you are guardians and 
responsible for your charges: the Ruler (i.e. Imam) is a guardian and 
responsible for his subjects; and a man is a guardian of his family 
and is responsible for his charges; and a lady is a guardian in the 
house of her husband and is responsible for her charge; and a servant 
is a guardian of the property of his master and is responsible for his
charge." I think he also said, "And a man is a guardian of the 
property of his father."
