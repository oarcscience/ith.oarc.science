### Hadith 4:80

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

I went to Allah's Apostle while he was at Khaibar after it had fallen in
the Muslims' hands. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Give me a share (from
the land of Khaibar)."

One of the sons of Sa'id bin Al-'As said, "O Allah's Apostle! Do not
give him a share." I said, "This is the murderer of Ibn Qauqal." The son
of Said bin Al-As said, "Strange! A Wabr (i.e. guinea pig) who has come
down to us from the mountain of Qaduim (i.e. grazing place of sheep)
blames me for killing a Muslim who was given superiority by Allah
because of me, and Allah did not disgrace me at his hands (i.e. was not
killed as an infidel)." (The sub-narrator said "I do not know whether
the Prophet gave him a share or not.")
