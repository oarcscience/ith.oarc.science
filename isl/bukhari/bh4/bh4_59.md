### Hadith 4:60

*Narrated Abdullah bin Abbas:*

That Abu Sufyan told him that Heraclius said to him, "I asked you about
the outcome of your battles with him (i.e. the Prophet ) and you told me
that you fought each other with alternate success. So the Apostles are
tested in this way but the ultimate victory is always theirs.
