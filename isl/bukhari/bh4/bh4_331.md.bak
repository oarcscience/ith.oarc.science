### Hadith 4:327

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

The delegates of the tribe of 'Abdul-Qais came and said, "O Allah's
Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi'a, and there is the infidels of
the tribe of Mudar intervening between you and us, so we cannot come to
you except in the Sacred Months. So please order us some instructions
that we may apply it to ourselves and also invite our people whom we
left behind us to observe as well." The Prophet said, "I order you (to
do) four (things) and forbid you (to do) four: I order you to believe in
Allah, that is, to testify that None has the right to be worshipped but
Allah (the Prophet pointed with his hand); to offer prayers perfectly;
to pay Zakat; to fast the month of Ramadan, and to pay the Khumus (i.e.
one-fifth) of the war booty to Allah and I forbid you to use Ad-dubba',
An-Naqir, Al-Hantam and Al-Muzaffat (i.e. utensils used for preparing
alcoholic drinks)." (See Hadith No. 50, Vol. 1).
