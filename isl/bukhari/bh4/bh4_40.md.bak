### Hadith 4:41

*Narrated Abdullah bin Masud:*

I asked Allah's Apostle, "O Allah's Apostle! What is the best deed?" He
replied, "To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times." I
asked, "What is next in goodness?" He replied, "To be good and dutiful
to your parents." I further asked, what is next in goodness?" He
replied, "To participate in Jihad in Allah's Cause." I did not ask
Allah's Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have told
me more.
