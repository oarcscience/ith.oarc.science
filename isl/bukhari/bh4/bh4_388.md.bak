### Hadith 4:384

*Narrated 'Umar bin Dinar:*

I was sitting with Jabir bin Zaid and 'Amr bin Aus, and Bjalla was
narrating to them in 70 A.H. the year when Musab bin Az-Zubair was the
leader of the pilgrims of Basra. We were sitting at the steps of Zam-zam
well and Bajala said, "I was the clerk of Juz bin Muawiya, Al-Ahnaf's
paternal uncle. A letter came from 'Umar bin Al-Khattab one year before
his death; and it was read:-- "Cancel every marriage contracted among
the Magians between relatives of close kinship (marriages that are
regarded illegal in Islam: a relative of this sort being called
Dhu-Mahram.)" 'Umar did not take the Jizya from the Magian infidels till
'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf testified that Allah's Apostle had taken the
Jizya from the Magians of Hajar.
