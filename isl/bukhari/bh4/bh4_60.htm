<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:61</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the Battle of Badr. He said,
"O Allah's Apostle! I was absent from the first battle you fought 
against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the
pagans, no doubt. Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight." On the 
day of Uhud when the Muslims turned their backs and fled, he said, "O 
Allah! I apologize to You for what these (i.e. his companions) have 
done, and I denounce what these (i.e. the pagans) have done." Then he 
advanced and Sad bin Muadh met him. He said "O Sad bin Muadh ! By the 
Lord of An-Nadr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before 
(the mountain of) Uhud," Later on Sad said, "O Allah's Apostle! I 
cannot achieve or do what he (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found 
more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body. We found him
dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister 
could recognize him by his fingers." We used to think that the 
following Verse was revealed concerning him and other men of his sort:
"Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with
Allah.........." (33.23)
<P>
His sister Ar-Rubbaya' broke a front tooth of a woman and Allah's 
Apostle ordered for retaliation. On that Anas (bin An-Nadr) said, "O 
Allah's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, my sister's 
tooth shall not be broken." Then the opponents of Anas's sister 
accepted the compensation and gave up the claim of retaliation. So 
Allah's Apostle said, "There are some people amongst Allah's slaves 
whose oaths are fulfilled by Allah when they take them."
