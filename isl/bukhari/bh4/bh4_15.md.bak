### Hadith 4:16

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

When Allah revealed the Verse: "Warn your nearest kinsmen," Allah's
Apostle got up and said, "O people of Quraish (or said similar words)!
Buy (i.e. save) yourselves (from the Hellfire) as I cannot save you from
Allah's Punishment; O Bani Abd Manaf! I cannot save you from Allah's
Punishment, O Safiya, the Aunt of Allah's Apostle! I cannot save you
from Allah's Punishment; O Fatima bint Muhammad! Ask me anything from my
wealth, but I cannot save you from Allah's Punishment."
