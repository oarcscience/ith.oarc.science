<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:495</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</I></P>
The Prophet said, "If while you are praying, somebody intends to pass 
in front of you, prevent him; and should he insist, prevent him again;
and if he insists again, fight with him (i.e. prevent him violently 
e.g. pushing him violently), because such a person is (like) a 
devil."

in charge of the Zakat of Ramadan (i.e. Zakat-ul-Fitr). Someone came 
to me and started scooping some of the foodstuff of (Zakat) with both 
hands. I caught him and told him that I would take him to Allah's 
Apostle." Then Abu Huraira told the whole narration and added "He 
(i.e. the thief) said, 'Whenever you go to your bed, recite the Verse 
of "Al-Kursi" (2.255) for then a guardian from Allah will be guarding 
you, and Satan will not approach you till dawn.' " On that the Prophet
said, "He told you the truth, though he is a liar, and he (the thief) 
himself was the Satan."
