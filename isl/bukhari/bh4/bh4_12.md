### Hadith 4:13

*Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Hakim bin Hizam said, "I asked Allah's*

Apostle for something, and he gave me, and I asked him again and he gave
me and said, 'O Hakim! This wealth is green and sweet (i.e. as tempting
as fruits), and whoever takes it with

The upper (i.e. giving) hand is better than the lower (i.e. taking)
hand." Hakim added, "I said, O Allah's Apostle! By Him Who has sent you
with the Truth I will never demand anything from anybody after you till
I die." Afterwards Abu Bakr used to call Hakim to give him something but
he refused to accept anything from him. Then 'Umar called him to give
him (something) but he refused. Then 'Umar said, "O Muslims! I offered
to him (i.e. Hakim) his share which Allah has ordained for him from this
booty and he refuses to take it." Thus Hakim did not ask anybody for
anything after the Prophet, till he died--may Allah bestow His mercy
upon him.
