### Hadith 4:533

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

The Prophet said, "Cover your utensils and tie your water skins, and
close your doors and keep your children close to you at night, as the
Jinns spread out at such time and snatch things away. When you go to
bed, put out your lights, for the mischief-doer (i.e. the rat) may drag
away the wick of the candle and burn the dwellers of the house." Ata
said, "The devils." (instead of the Jinns).
