### Hadith 4:30

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Abu Talha had the greatest wealth of date-palms amongst the Ansar in
Medina, and he prized above all his wealth (his garden) Bairuha', which
was situated opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet ). The Prophet used to
enter It and drink from its fresh water. When the following Divine Verse
came:--

"By no means shall you attain piety until you spend of what you love,"
(3.92)

Abu Talha got up saying. "O Allah's Apostle! Allah says, 'You will not
attain piety until you spend of what you love,' and I prize above al I
my wealth, Bairuha' which I want to give in charity for Allah's Sake,
hoping for its reward from Allah. So you can use it as Allah directs
you." On that the Prophet said, "Bravo! It is a profitable (or
perishable) property. (Ibn Maslama is not sure as to which word is
right, i.e. profitable or perishable.) I have heard what you have said,
and I recommend that you distribute this amongst your relatives." On
that Abu Talha said, "O Allah's Apostle! I will do (as you have
suggested)." So, Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives
and cousins.
