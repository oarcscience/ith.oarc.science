### Hadith 4:451

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "When the Imam, during the prayer, says, "Allah
hears him who praises Him', say: 'O Allah! Our Lord! All the praises are
for You/, for if the saying of anyone of you coincides with the saying
of the angels, his past sins will be forgiven."
