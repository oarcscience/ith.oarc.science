### Hadith 4:224

*Narrated Suwaid bin An-Nu'man:*

That he went out in the company o; the Prophet during the year of
Khaibar (campaign till they reached a place called As-Sahba', the lower
part of Khaibar. They offered the 'Asr prayer (there) and the Prophet
asked for the food. Nothing but Sawiq was brought to the Prophet. So,
they chewed it and ate it and drank water. After that the Prophet got
up, washed his mouth, and they too washed their mouths and then offered
the prayer.
