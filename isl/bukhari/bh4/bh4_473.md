### Hadith 4:469

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "The first batch (of people) who will enter
Paradise will be (glittering) like a full moon; and those who will enter
next will be (glittering) like the brightest star. Their hearts will be
as if the heart of a single man, for they will have no enmity amongst
themselves, and everyone of them shall have two wives, each of whom will
be so beautiful, pure and transparent that the marrow of the bones of
their legs will be seen through the flesh. They will be glorifying Allah
in the morning and evening, and will never fall ill, and they will
neither blow their noses, nor spit. Their utensils will be of gold and
silver, and their combs will be of gold, and the fuel used in their
centers will be the aloes-wood, and their sweat will smell like musk."
