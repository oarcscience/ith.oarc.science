### Hadith 4:227

*Narrated Aisha:*

That she said, "O Allah's Apostle! Your companions are returning with
the reward of both Hajj and 'Umra, while I am returning with (the reward
of) Hajj only." He said to her, "Go, and let 'Abdur-Rahman (i.e. your
brother) make you sit behind him (on the animal)." So, he ordered
'AbdurRahman to let her perform 'Umra from Al-Tan'im. Then the Prophet
waited for her at the higher region of Mecca till she returned.
