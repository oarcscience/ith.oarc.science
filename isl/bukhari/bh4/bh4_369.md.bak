### Hadith 4:365

*Narrated Jabir:*

Allah's Apostle said (to me), "If the property of Bahrain had come to
us, I would have given you so much and so much." But the Bahrain
property did not come till the Prophet had died. When the Bahrain
property came. Abu Bakr ordered somebody to announce, "Any person who
has money claim on Allah's Apostle or whom Allah's Apostle had promised
something, should come to us." So, I went to him and said, "Allah's
Apostle had promised to give me so much an so much." Abu Bakr scooped up
money with both hands thrice for me." (The sub-narrator Sufyan
illustrated this action by scooping up with both hands and said, "Ibn
Munkadir, another sub-narrator, used to illustrate it in this way.")

did not give me, and I went to him again, but he did not give me, so I
went to him for the third time and said, "I asked you, but you did not
give me; then I asked you (for the second time) and you did not give me;
then I asked you (for the third time) but you did not give me. You
should either give me or allow yourself to be considered a miser
regarding my case." Abu Bakr said, "You tell me that I am a miser with
regard to you. But really, whenever I rejected your request, I had the
inclination to give you."

(In another narration Jabir added:) So, Abu Bakr scooped up money with
both hands for me and asked me to count it. I found out that It was five
hundred. Abu Bakr told me to take twice that amount.
