### Hadith 4:87

*Narrated Anas:*

Allah's Apostle went towards the Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and saw the
Emigrants and the Ansar digging in a very cold morning as they did not
have slaves to do that for them. When he noticed their fatigue and
hunger he said, "O Allah! The real life is that of the Here-after, (so
please) forgive the Ansar and the Emigrants." In its reply the Emigrants
and the Ansar said, "We are those who have given a pledge of allegiance
to Muhammad that we will carry on Jihad as long as we live."
