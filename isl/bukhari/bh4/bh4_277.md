### Hadith 4:274

*Narrated Abu Hazim:*

The people asked Sahl bin Sad As-Sa' idi "With what thing (medicine) was
the wound of Allah's Apostle treated?" He replied, "There is none left
(living) amongst the people who knows it better than. 'Ali used to bring
water in his shield and Fatima (i.e. the Prophet's daughter) used to
wash the blood off his face. Then a mat (of palm leaves) was burnt and
its ash was inserted in the wound of Allah's Apostle."
