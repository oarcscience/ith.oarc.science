### Hadith 4:181

*Narrated Abu Ishaq:*

A man asked Al-Bara', "O Abu 'Umara! Did you all flee on the day (of the
battle) of Hunain?" He replied, "No, by Allah! Allah's Apostle did not
flee, but his young unarmed companions passed by the archers of the
tribe of Hawazin and Bani Nasr whose arrows hardly missed a target, and
they threw arrows at them hardly missing a shot. So the Muslims
retreated towards the Prophet while he was riding his white mule which
was being led by his cousin Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith bin 'Abdul
Muttalib. The Prophet dismounted and invoked Allah for victory; then he
said, 'I am the Prophet, without a lie; I am the son of 'Abdul Muttalib,
and then he arranged his companions in rows."
