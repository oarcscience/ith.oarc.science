Al Harith bin Hisham asked the Prophet, "How does the divine 
inspiration come to you?" He replied, "In all these ways: The Angel 
sometimes comes to me with a voice which resembles the sound of a 
ringing bell, and when this state abandons me, I remember what the 
Angel has said, and this type of Divine Inspiration is the hardest on 
me; and  sometimes the Angel comes to me in the shape of a man and 
talks to me, and I understand and remember what he says."
