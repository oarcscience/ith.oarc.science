<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:272</H3><P><I>Narrated Al-Bara:</I></P>
I saw Allah's Apostle on the day (of the battle) of the Trench 
carrying earth till the hair of his chest were covered with dust and 
he was a hairy man. He was reciting the following verses of 'Abdullah 
(bin Rawaha): "O Allah, were it not for You, We would not have been 
guided, Nor would we have given in charity, nor prayed. So, bestow on 
us calmness, and when we meet the enemy. Then make our feet firm, for 
indeed, Yet if they want to put us in affliction, (i.e. want to fight 
against us) we would not (flee but withstand them)." The Prophet used 
to raise his voice while reciting these verses. (See 
Hadith No. 432, Vol. 5).
