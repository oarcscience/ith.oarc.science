<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:587</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
(the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle said (to her). "Don't you 
see that when your folk built the Ka'ba, they did not build it on all 
the foundations built by Abraham?" I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Why 
don't we rebuild it on the foundations of Abraham?" He said. "But for 
the fact that your folk have recently given up infidelity (I would 
have done so)."
<P>
I see that Allah's Apostle used not to touch the two corners facing 
Al-Hijr only because the House had not been built on the foundations 
of Abraham''
