### Hadith 4:536

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Once while a prophet amongst the prophets was
taking a rest underneath a tree, an ant bit him. He, therefore, ordered
that his luggage be taken away from underneath that tree and then
ordered that the dwelling place of the ants should be set on fire. Allah
sent him a revelation:-- "Wouldn't it have been sufficient to burn a
single ant? (that bit you): (See Page 162, chapter No. 153).
