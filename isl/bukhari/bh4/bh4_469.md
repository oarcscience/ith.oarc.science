### Hadith 4:465

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

While we were in the company of the Prophet, he said, "While I was
asleep, I saw myself in Paradise and there I beheld a woman making
ablution beside a palace, I asked, To whom does this palace belong?
'They said, To 'Umar bin Al-Khattab.' Then I remembered 'Umar's Ghaira
(concerning women), and so I quickly went away from that palace." (When
'Umar heard this from the Prophet), he wept and said, "Do you think it
is likely that I feel Ghaira because of you, O Allah's Apostle?"
