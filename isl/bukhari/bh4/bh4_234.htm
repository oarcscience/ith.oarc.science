<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:232</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "There is a (compulsory) Sadaqa (charity) to be 
given for every joint of the human body (as a sign of gratitude to 
Allah) everyday the sun rises. To judge justly between two persons is 
regarded as Sadaqa, and to help a man concerning his riding animal by 
helping him to ride it or by lifting his luggage on to it, is also 
regarded as Sadaqa, and (saying) a good word is also Sadaqa, and every
step taken on one's way to offer the compulsory prayer (in the mosque)
is also Sadaqa and to remove a harmful thing from the way is also 
Sadaqa."
