### Hadith 4:346

*Narrated Muawiya:*

Allah's Apostle said, "If Allah wants to do good for somebody, he makes
him comprehend the Religion (i.e. Islam), and Allah is the Giver and I
am Al-Qasim (i.e. the distributor), and this (Muslim) nation will remain
victorious over their opponents, till Allah's Order comes and they will
still be victorious "

(anything) nor withhold (anything) from you, but I am just a distributor
(i.e. Qasim), and I give as I am ordered."
