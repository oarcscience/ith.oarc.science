### Hadith 4:634

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "A strong demon from the Jinns came to me yesterday
suddenly, so as to spoil my prayer, but Allah enabled me to overpower
him, and so I caught him and intended to tie him to one of the pillars
of the Mosque so that all of you might see him, but I remembered the
invocation of my brother Solomon: 'And grant me a kingdom such as shall
not belong to any other after me.' (38.35) so I let him go cursed."
