<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:289</H3><P><I>Narrated Ibn 'Umar:</I></P>
'Umar saw a silken cloak being sold in the market and he brought it to
Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Buy this cloak and adorn
yourself with it on the 'Id festivals and on meeting the delegations."
Allah's Apostle replied, "This is the dress for the one who will have 
no share in the Hereafter (or, this is worn by one who will have no 
share in the Hereafter)." After sometime had passed, Allah's Apostle 
sent a silken cloak to 'Umar. 'Umar took it and brought it to Allah's 
Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! You have said that this is the 
dress of that who will have no share in the Hereafter (or, this is 
worn by one who will have no share in the Hereafter), yet you have 
sent me this!" The Prophet said," I have sent it) so that you may sell
it or fulfill with it some of your needs."
