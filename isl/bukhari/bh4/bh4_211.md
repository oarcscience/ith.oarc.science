### Hadith 4:210

*Narrated Salim Abu An-Nadr:*

The freed slave of 'Umar bin 'Ubaidullah who was 'Umar's clerk:
'Abdullah bin Abi Aufa wrote him (i.e. 'Umar) a letter that contained
the following:--

"Once Allah's Apostle (during a holy battle), waited till the sun had
declined and then he got up among the people and said, "O people! Do not
wish to face the enemy (in a battle) and ask Allah to save you (from
calamities) but if you should face the enemy, then be patient and let it
be known to you that Paradise is under the shades of swords." He then
said,, "O Allah! The Revealer of the (Holy) Book, the Mover of the
clouds, and Defeater of Al-Ahzab (i.e. the clans of infidels), defeat
them infidels and bestow victory upon us."
