### Hadith 4:425

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

On the day of a solar eclipse, Allah's Apostle stood up (to offer the
eclipse prayer). He recited Takbir, recited a long recitation (of Holy
Verses), bowed a long bowing, and then he raised h is head saying.
"Allah hears him who sends his praises to Him." Then he stayed standing,
recited a long recitation again, but shorter than the former, bowed a
long bowing, but shorter than the first, performed a long prostration
and then performed the second Rak'a in the same way as he had done the
first. By the time he had finished his prayer with Taslim, the solar
eclipse had been over. Then he addressed the people referring to the
solar and lunar eclipses saying, "These are two signs amongst the Signs
of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of anyone's death or life. So,
if you see them, hasten for the Prayer."
