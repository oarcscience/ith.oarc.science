### Hadith 4:238

*Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:*

Whenever the Prophet returned from the Hajj or the 'Umra or a Ghazwa, he
would say Takbir thrice. Whenever he came upon a mountain path or
wasteland, and then he would say, "None has the right to be worshipped
but Allah, Alone Who has no partner. All the Kingdom belongs to Him and
all the praises are for Him and He is Omnipotent. We are returning with
repentance, worshipping, prostrating ourselves and praising our Lord.
Allah fulfilled His Promise, granted victory to His slave and He Alone
defeated all the clans."
