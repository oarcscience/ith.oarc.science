<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:222</H3><P><I>Narrated Asma:</I></P>
I prepared the journey-food for Allah's Apostle in Abu Bakr's house 
when he intended to emigrate to Medina. I could not find anything to 
tie the food-container and the water skin with. So, I said to Abu 
Bakr, "By Allah, I do not find anything to tie (these things) with 
except my waist belt." He said, "Cut it into two pieces and tie the 
water-skin with one piece and the food-container with the other (the 
sub-narrator added, "She did accordingly and that was the reason for 
calling her Dhatun-Nitaqain (i.e. two-belted woman))."
