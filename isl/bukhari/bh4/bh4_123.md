### Hadith 4:122

*Narrated Abu Ishaq from Musa bin 'Uqba from Mafia from Ibn 'Umar who*

said:

"Allah's Apostle arranged a horse race amongst the horses that had been
made lean, letting them start from Al-Hafya' and their limit (distance
of running) was up to Thaniyat-al-Wada'. I asked Musa, 'What was the
distance between the two places?' Musa replied, 'Six or seven miles. He
arranged a race of the horses which had not been made lean sending them
from Thaniyat-al-Wada', and their limit was up to the mosque of Bani
Zuraiq.' I asked, 'What was the distance between those two places?' He
replied 'One mile or so.' Ibn 'Umar was amongst those who participated
in that horse race."
