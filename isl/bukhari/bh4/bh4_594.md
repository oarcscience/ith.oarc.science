### Hadith 4:591

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "We are more liable to be in doubt than Abraham
when he said, 'My Lord! Show me how You give life to the dead." . He
(i.e. Allah) slid: 'Don't you believe then?' He (i.e. Abraham) said:
"Yes, but (I ask) in order to be stronger in Faith." (2.260) And may
Allah send His Mercy on Lot! He wished to have a powerful support. If I
were to stay in prison for such a long time as Joseph did I would have
accepted the offer (of freedom without insisting on having my guiltless
less declared)."
