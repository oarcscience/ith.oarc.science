### Hadith 4:604

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "While Job was naked, taking a bath, a swarm of gold
locusts fell on him and he started collecting them in his garment. His
Lord called him, 'O Job! Have I not made you rich enough to need what
you see? He said, 'Yes, O Lord! But I cannot dispense with your
Blessing."'
