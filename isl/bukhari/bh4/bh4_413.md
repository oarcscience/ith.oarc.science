### Hadith 4:409

*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

While the Prophet was in the state of prostration, surrounded by a group
of people from Quraish pagans. 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait came and brought the
intestines of a camel and threw them on the back of the Prophet . The
Prophet did not raise his head from prostration till Fatima (i.e. his
daughter) came and removed those intestines from his back, and invoked
evil on whoever had done (the evil deed). The Prophet said, "O Allah!
Destroy the chiefs of Quraish, O Allah! Destroy Abu Jahl bin Hisham,
'Utba bin Rabi'a, Shaiba bin Rabi'a. 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait 'Umaiya bin
Khalaf (or Ubai bin Kalaf)." Later on I saw all of them killed during
the battle of Badr and their bodies were thrown into a well except the
body of Umaiya or Ubai, because he was a fat person, and when he was
pulled, the parts of his body got separated before he was thrown into
the well.
