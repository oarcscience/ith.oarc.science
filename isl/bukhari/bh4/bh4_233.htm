<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:231</H3><P><I>Narrated Nafi from 'Abdullah:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle came to Mecca through its higher region on the day of 
the Conquest (of Mecca) riding his she-camel on which Usama was riding
behind him. Bilal and 'Uthman bin Talha, one of the servants of the 
Ka'ba, were also accompanying him till he made his camel kneel in the 
mosque and ordered the latter to bring the key of the Ka'ba. He opened
the door of the Ka'ba and Allah's Apostle entered in the company of 
Usama, Bilal and 'Uthman, and stayed in it for a long period. When he 
came out, the people rushed to it, and 'Abdullah bin 'Umar was the 
first to enter it and found Bilal standing behind the door. He asked 
Bilal, "Where did the Prophet offer his prayer?" He pointed to the 
place where he had offered his prayer. 'Abdullah said, "I forgot to 
ask him how many Rakat he had performed."
