### Hadith 4:308

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:*

There was a man who looked after the family and the belongings of the
Prophet and he was called Karkara. The man died and Allah's Apostle
said, "He is in the '(Hell) Fire." The people then went to look at him
and found in his place, a cloak he had stolen from the war booty.
