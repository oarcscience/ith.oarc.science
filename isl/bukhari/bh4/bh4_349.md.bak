### Hadith 4:345

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari:*

A man amongst us begot a boy whom he named Al-Qasim. On that the Ansar
said, (to the man), "We will never call you Abu-al-Qasim and will never
please you with this blessed title." So, he went to the Prophet and
said, "O Allah's Apostle! I have begotten a boy whom I named Al-Qasim
and the Ansar said, 'We will never call you Abu-al-Qasim, nor will we
please you with this title.' " The Prophet said, "The Ansar have done
well. Name by my name, but do not name by my Kunya, for I am Qasim."
