Allah's Apostle delivered a sermon and said, "Zaid received the flag 
and was martyred, then Ja'far took it and was martyred, then 'Abdullah
bin Rawaha took it and was martyred, and then Khalid bin Al-Walid took
it without being appointed, and Allah gave him victory." The Prophet 
added, "I am not pleased (or they will not be pleased) that they 
should remain (alive) with us," while his eyes were shedding tears.
