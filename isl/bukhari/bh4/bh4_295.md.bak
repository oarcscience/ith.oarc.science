### Hadith 4:291

*Narrated Usama bin Zaid:*

I asked the Prophet during his Hajj, "O Allah's Apostle! Where will you
stay tomorrow?" He said, "Has Aqil left for us any house?" He then
added, "Tomorrow we will stay at Khaif Bani Kinana, i.e. Al-Muhassab,
where (the Pagans of) Quraish took an oath of Kufr (i.e. to be loyal to
heathenism) in that Bani Kinana got allied with Quraish against Bani
Hashim on the terms that they would not deal with the members of the is
tribe or give them shelter." (Az-Zuhri said, "Khaif means valley.") (See
Hadith No. 659, Vol. 2)
