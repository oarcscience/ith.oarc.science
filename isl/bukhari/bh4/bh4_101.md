*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

When the Prophet called the people (Sadqa, a sub-narrator, said, 'Most
probably that happened on the day of Al-Khandaq) Az-Zubair responded to
the call (i.e. to act as a reconnoiter). The Prophet) called the people
again and Az-Zubair responded to the call. The Prophet then said, "Every
prophet had a disciple and my disciple is Zubair bin Al-'Awwam."
