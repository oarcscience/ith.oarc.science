<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:211</H3><P><I>Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:</I></P>
I participated in a Ghazwa along with Allah's Apostle The Prophet met 
me (on the way) while I was riding a camel of ours used for irrigation
and it had got so tired that it could hardly walk. The Prophet asked 
me, "What is wrong with the camel?" I replied, "It has got tired." So.
Allah's Apostle came from behind it and rebuked it and prayed for it 
so it started surpassing the other camels and going ahead of them. 
Then he asked me, "How do you find your camel (now)?" I replied, "I 
find it quite well, now as it has received your blessings." He said, 
"Will you sell it to me?" I felt shy (to refuse his offer) though it 
was the only camel for irrigation we had. So, I said, "Yes." He said, 
"Sell it to me then." I sold it to him on the condition that I should 
keep on riding it till I reached Medina. Then I said, "O Allah's 
Apostle! I am a bridegroom," and requested him to allow me to go home.
He allowed me, and I set out for Medina before the people till I 
reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the camel and
I informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the
permission of Allah's Apostle he asked me whether I had married a 
virgin or a matron and I replied that I had married a matron. He said,
"Why hadn't you married a virgin who would have played with you, and 
you would have played with her?" I replied, "O Allah's Apostle! My 
father died (or was martyred) and I have some young sisters, so I felt
it not proper that I should marry a young girl like them who would 
neither teach them manners nor serve them. So, I have married a matron
so that she may serve them and teach them manners." When Allah's 
Apostle arrived in Medina, I took the camel to him the next morning 
and he gave me its price and gave me the camel itself as well.
