### Hadith 4:571

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

When the Prophet saw pictures in the Ka'ba, he did not enter it till he
ordered them to be erased. When he saw (the pictures of Abraham and
Ishmael carrying the arrows of divination, he said, "May Allah curse
them (i.e. the Quraish)! By Allah, neither Abraham nor Ishmael practiced
divination by arrows."
