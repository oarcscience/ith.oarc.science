### Hadith 4:619

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Angel of Death was sent to Moses when he came to Moses, Moses
slapped him on the eye. The angel returned to his Lord and said, "You
have sent me to a Slave who does not want to die." Allah said, "Return
to him and tell him to put his hand on the back of an ox and for every
hair that will come under it, he will be granted one year of life."
Moses said, "O Lord! What will happen after that?" Allah replied, "Then
death." Moses said, "Let it come now." Moses then requested Allah to let
him die close to the Sacred Land so much so that he would be at a
distance of a stone's throw from it." Abu Huraira added, "Allah's
Apostle said, 'If I were there, I would show you his grave below the red
sand hill on the side of the road."
