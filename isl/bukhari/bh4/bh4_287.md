### Hadith 4:284

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Some Ansari men asked permission from Allah's Apostle saying, "O Allah's
Apostle! Allow us not to take the ransom of our nephew Al Abbas. The
Prophet replied, "Do not leave a single Dirham thereof."

(In another narration) Anas said, "Some wealth was brought to the
Prophet from Bahrain. Al Abbas came to him and said, 'O Allah's Apostle!
Give me (some of it), as I have paid my and 'Aqil's ransom.' The Prophet
said, 'Take,' and gave him in his garment."
