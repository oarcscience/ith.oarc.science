### Hadith 4:396

*Narrated Um Hani:*

the daughter of Abu Talib: I went to Allah's Apostle on the day of the
conquest of Mecca and found him taking a bath, and his daughter Fatima
was screening him. I greeted him and he asked, "Who is that?" I said,
"I, Um Hani bint Abi Talib." He said, "Welcome, O Um Hani." When he had
finished his bath, he stood up and offered eight Rakat while dressed in
one garment. I said, "O Allah's Apostle! My brother 'Ali has declared
that he will kill a man to whom I have granted asylum. The man is so
and-so bin Hubaira." Allah's Apostle said, "O Um Hani! We will grant
asylum to the one whom you have granted asylum." (Um Hani said, "That
(visit) took place in the Duha (i.e. forenoon)).
