### Hadith 4:587

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

(the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle said (to her). "Don't you see
that when your folk built the Ka'ba, they did not build it on all the
foundations built by Abraham?" I said, "O Allah's Apostle! Why don't we
rebuild it on the foundations of Abraham?" He said. "But for the fact
that your folk have recently given up infidelity (I would have done
so)."

I see that Allah's Apostle used not to touch the two corners facing
Al-Hijr only because the House had not been built on the foundations of
Abraham''
