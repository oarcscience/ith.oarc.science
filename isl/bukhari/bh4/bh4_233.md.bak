### Hadith 4:231

*Narrated Nafi from 'Abdullah:*

Allah's Apostle came to Mecca through its higher region on the day of
the Conquest (of Mecca) riding his she-camel on which Usama was riding
behind him. Bilal and 'Uthman bin Talha, one of the servants of the
Ka'ba, were also accompanying him till he made his camel kneel in the
mosque and ordered the latter to bring the key of the Ka'ba. He opened
the door of the Ka'ba and Allah's Apostle entered in the company of
Usama, Bilal and 'Uthman, and stayed in it for a long period. When he
came out, the people rushed to it, and 'Abdullah bin 'Umar was the first
to enter it and found Bilal standing behind the door. He asked Bilal,
"Where did the Prophet offer his prayer?" He pointed to the place where
he had offered his prayer. 'Abdullah said, "I forgot to ask him how many
Rakat he had performed."
