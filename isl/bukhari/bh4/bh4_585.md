### Hadith 4:582

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

The Prophet said, "May Allah bestow His Mercy on the mother of Ishmael!
Had she not hastened (to fill her water-skin with water from the Zam-zam
well). Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the
earth." Ibn 'Abbas further added, "(The Prophet) Abraham brought Ishmael
and his mother (to Mecca) and she was suckling Ishmael and she had a
water-skin with her.'
