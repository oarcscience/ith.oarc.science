### Hadith 4:518

*Narrated Ibn Umar:*

That he heard the Prophet delivering a sermon on the pulpit saying,
"Kill snakes and kill Dhu-at-Tufyatain (i.e. a snake with two white
lines on its back) and ALBATROSS (i.e. a snake with short or mutilated
tail) for they destroy the sight of one's eyes and bring about
abortion." ('Abdullah bin 'Umar further added): Once while I was chasing
a snake in order, to kill it, Abu Lubaba called me saying: "Don't kill
it," I said. "Allah's Apostle ordered us to kill snakes." He said, "But
later on he prohibited the killing of snakes living in the houses."
(Az-Zubri said. "Such snakes are called Al-Awamir.")
