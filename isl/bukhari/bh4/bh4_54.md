### Hadith 4:55

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

The Prophet delivered a sermon and said, "Zaid took the flag and was
martyred, and then Ja'far took the flag and was martyred, and then
'Abdullah bin Rawaha took the flag and was martyred too, and then Khalid
bin Al-Walid took the flag though he was not appointed as a commander
and Allah made him victorious." The Prophet further added, "It would not
please us to have them with us." Aiyub, a sub-narrator, added, "Or the
Prophet, shedding tears, said, 'It would not p ease them to be with us."
