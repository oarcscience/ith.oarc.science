<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:261</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas bin Malik:</I></P>
A group of eight men from the tribe of 'Ukil came to the Prophet and 
then they found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So, they 
said, "O Allah's Apostle! Provide us with some milk." Allah's Apostle 
said, "I recommend that you should join the herd of camels." So they 
went and drank the urine and the milk of the camels (as a medicine) 
till they became healthy and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and 
drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after whey were 
Muslims. When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent 
some men in their pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were 
brought, and he had their hands and feet cut off. Then he ordered for 
nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and whey were left
in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina). They asked for water, and 
nobody provided them with water till they died (Abu Qilaba, a 
sub-narrator said, "They committed murder and theft and fought against
Allah and His Apostle, and spread evil in the land.")
