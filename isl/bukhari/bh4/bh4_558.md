### Hadith 4:555

*Narrated Abu Said:*

Allah's Apostle said, "Noah and his nation will come (on the Day of
Resurrection and Allah will ask (Noah), "Did you convey (the Message)?'
He will reply, 'Yes, O my Lord!' Then Allah will ask Noah's nation, 'Did
Noah convey My Message to you?' They will reply, 'No, no prophet came to
us.' Then Allah will ask Noah, 'Who will stand a witness for you?' He
will reply, 'Muhammad and his followers (will stand witness for me).'
So, I and my followers will stand as witnesses for him (that he conveyed
Allah's Message)." That is, (the interpretation) of the Statement of
Allah: "Thus we have made you a just and the best nation that you might
be witnesses Over mankind .." (2.143)
