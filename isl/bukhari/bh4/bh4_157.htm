The 'Prophet was the best and the bravest amongst the people. Once the
people of Medina got terrified at night, so they went in the direction
of the noise (that terrified them). The Prophet met them (on his way 
back) after he had found out the truth. He was riding an unsaddled 
horse belonging to Abu Talha and a sword was hanging by his neck, and 
he was saying, "Don't be afraid! Don't be afraid!" He further said, "I
found it (i.e. the horse) very fast," or said, "This horse is very 
fast." (Qastala-ni)
