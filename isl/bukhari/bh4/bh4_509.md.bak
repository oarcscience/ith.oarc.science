### Hadith 4:505

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "When the call for the prayer is pronounced, Satan
takes to his heels, passing wind with noise, When the call for the
prayer is finished, he comes back. And when the Iqama is pronounced, he
again takes to his heels, and after its completion, he returns again to
interfere between the (praying) person and his heart, saying to him.
'Remember this or that thing.' till the person forgets whether he has
offered three or four Rakat: so if one forgets whether he has prayed
three or four Rak'a-t, he should perform two prostrations of Sahu (i.e.
forgetfulness)."
