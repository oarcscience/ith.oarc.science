### Hadith 4:290

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

Umar and a group of the companions of the Prophet set out with the
Prophet to Ibn Saiyad. He found him playing with some boys near the
hillocks of Bani Maghala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his
puberty. He did not notice (the Prophet's presence) till the Prophet
stroked him on the back with his hand and said, "Ibn Saiyad! Do you
testify that I am Allah's Apostle?" Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said,
"I testify that you are the Apostle of the illiterates."

Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet. "Do you testify that I am the apostle
of Allah?" The Prophet said to him, "I believe in Allah and His
Apostles." Then the Prophet said (to Ibn Saiyad). "What do you see?" Ibn
Saiyad replied, "True people and false ones visit me." The Prophet said,
"Your mind is confused as to this matter." The Prophet added, " I have
kept something (in my mind) for you." Ibn Saiyad said, "It is Ad-Dukh."
The Prophet said (to him), "Shame be on you! You cannot cross your
limits." On that 'Umar said, "O Allah's Apostle! Allow me to chop his
head off." The Prophet said, "If he should be him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) then
you cannot overpower him, and should he not be him, then you are not
going to benefit by murdering him."
