### Hadith 4:610

*Narrated Abu Said:*

The Prophet said, 'People will be struck unconscious on the Day of
Resurrection and I will be the first to regain consciousness, and
behold! There I will see Moses holding one of the pillars of Allah's
Throne. I will wonder whether he has become conscious before me of he
has been exempted, because of his unconsciousness at the Tur (mountain)
which he received (on the earth)."
