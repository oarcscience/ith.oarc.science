written in this paper, (wherein) the Prophet said, "Medina is a
sanctuary from (the mountain of) Air to so and-so, therefore, whoever
innovates (in it) an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such
an innovator, will incur the Curse of Allah. the angels and all the
people; and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship
will be accepted And the asylum granted by any Muslim Is to be secured

compulsory and optional good deeds of worship will not be accepted. And

latter, will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all the people,
and his compulsory and optional good deeds of worship will not be
accepted."

Statement say?" He replied, "Allah and His Apostle's asylum granted to
Dhimmis, i.e. non-Muslims living in a Muslim territory) will be
outraged, and so Allah will make the hearts of these Dhimmis so daring
that they will refuse to pay the Jizya they will be supposed to pay."
