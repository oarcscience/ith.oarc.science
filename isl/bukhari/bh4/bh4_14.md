### Hadith 4:15

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet said to Abu Talha, "I recommend that you divide (this
garden) amongst your relatives." Abu Talha said, "O Allah's Apostle! I
will do the same." So Abu Talha divided it among his relatives and
cousins.

Ibn 'Abbes said, "When the Qur'anic Verse:

"Warn your nearest kinsmen." (26.214)

Was revealed, the Prophet started calling the various big families of
Quraish, "O Bani Fihr! O Bani Adi!".

Abu Huraira said, "When the Verse: "Warn your nearest kinsmen" was
revealed, the Prophet said (in a loud voice), "O people of Quraish!"
