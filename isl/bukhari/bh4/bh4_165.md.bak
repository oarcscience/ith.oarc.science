### Hadith 4:164

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

The Prophet , while in a tent (on the day of the battle of Badr) said,
"O Allah! I ask you the fulfillment of Your Covenant and Promise. O
Allah! If You wish (to destroy the believers) You will never be
worshipped after today." Abu Bakr caught him by the hand and said, "This
is sufficient, O Allah's Apostle! You have asked Allah pressingly." The
Prophet was clad in his armor at that time. He went out, saying to me:
"There multitude will be put to flight and they will show their backs.
Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense)
and that Hour will be more grievous and more bitter (than their worldly
failure)." (54.45-46) Khalid said that was on the day of the battle of
Badr.
