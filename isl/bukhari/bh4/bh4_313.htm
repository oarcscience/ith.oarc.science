<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:309</H3><P><I>Narrated Abaya bin Rifaa:</I></P>
My grandfather, Rafi said, "We were in the company of the Prophet at 
DhulHulaifa, and the people suffered from hunger. We got some camels 
and sheep (as booty) and the Prophet was still behind the people. They
hurried and put the cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he 
ordered that the cooking pots should be upset and then he distributed 
the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one 
camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, 
as they had a few horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at 
it and caused it to stop (with Allah's Permission). On that the 
Prophet said, 'Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so, if 
any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way." My 
grandfather asked (the Prophet ), "We hope (or are afraid) that we may
meet the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives. Can we slaughter our 
animals with canes?" Allah's Apostle replied, "If the instrument used 
for killing causes the animal to bleed profusely and if Allah's Name 
is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but 
won't use a tooth or a nail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth 
is a bone (and slaughtering with a bone is forbidden ), and a nail is 
the slaughtering instrument of the Ethiopians."
