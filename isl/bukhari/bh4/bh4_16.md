### Hadith 4:17

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet saw a man driving a Badana (i.e. camel for sacrifice) and
said to him, "Ride on it." The man said, "O Allah's Apostle! It is a
Bandana." (The Prophet repeated his order) and on the third or fourth
time he said, "Ride it, (woe to you" or said: "May Allah be merciful to
you)."
