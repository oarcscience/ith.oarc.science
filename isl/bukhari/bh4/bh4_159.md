### Hadith 4:158

*Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah:*

That he proceeded in the company of Allah's Apostle towards Najd to
participate in a Ghazwa. (Holy-battle) When Allah's Apostle returned, he
too returned with him. Midday came upon them while they were in a valley
having many thorny trees. Allah's Apostle and the people dismounted and
dispersed to rest in the shade of the trees. Allah's Apostle rested
under a tree and hung his sword on it. We all took a nap and suddenly we
heard Allah's Apostle calling us. (We woke up) to see a bedouin with
him. The Prophet said, "This bedouin took out my sword while I was
sleeping and when I woke up, I found the unsheathed sword in his hand
and he challenged me saying, 'Who will save you from me?' I said thrice,
'Allah.' The Prophet did not punish him but sat down.
