<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 4:226</H3><P><I>Narrated Wahb bin Kaisan:</I></P>
Jabir bin 'Abdullah said, "We set out, and we were three-hundred men 
carrying our journey-food on our shoulders. Then we began to eat a 
single date each per day." A man asked (Jabir), "O Abu 'Abdullah! How 
could a person be satisfied with a single date?" Jabir replied, "We 
realized the value of that one date when we could not even have that 
much till we reached the sea-shore, when all of a sudden we saw a huge
fish cast by the sea. So, we ate of it as much as we wished for 
eighteen days."
