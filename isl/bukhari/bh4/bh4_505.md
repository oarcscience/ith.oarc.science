*Narrated Safiya bint Huyay:*

While Allah's Apostle was in Itikaf, I called on him at night and having
had a talk with him, I got up to depart. He got up also to accompany me
to my dwelling place, which was then in the house of Usama bin Zaid. Two

Huyay (i.e. my wife)." They said, "Glorified be Allah! O Allah's
Apostle! (How dare we suspect you?)" He said, "Satan circulates in the
human mind as blood circulates in it, and I was afraid that Satan might
throw an evil thought (or something) into your hearts."
