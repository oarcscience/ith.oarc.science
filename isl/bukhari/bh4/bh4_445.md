### Hadith 4:441

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

Allah's Apostle asked Gabriel, "Why don't you visit us more often than
you do?" Then the following Holy Verse was revealed (in this respect):--
"And we (angels) descend not but by the order of your Lord. To Him
belong what is before us and what is behind us, and what is between
those two and your Lord was never forgetful." (19.64)
