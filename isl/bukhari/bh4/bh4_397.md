### Hadith 4:393

*Narrated Said bin Jubair:*

that he heard Ibn 'Abbas saying, "Thursday! And you know not what
Thursday is? After that Ibn 'Abbas wept till the stones on the ground
were soaked with his tears. On that I asked Ibn 'Abbas, "What is (about)
Thursday?" He said, "When the condition (i.e. health) of Allah's Apostle
deteriorated, he said, 'Bring me a bone of scapula, so that I may write
something for you after which you will never go astray.'The people
differed in their opinions although it was improper to differ in front
of a prophet, They said, 'What is wrong with him? Do you think he is
delirious? Ask him (to understand). The Prophet replied, 'Leave me as I
am in a better state than what you are asking me to do.' Then the
Prophet ordered them to do three things saying, 'Turn out all the pagans
from the Arabian Peninsula, show respect to all foreign delegates by
giving them gifts as I used to do.' " The sub-narrator added, "The third
order was something beneficial which either Ibn 'Abbas did not mention
or he mentioned but I forgot.'
