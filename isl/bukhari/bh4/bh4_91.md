### Hadith 4:90

*Narrated Al-Bara:*

On the day (of the battle) of Al-Ahzab (i.e. clans) I saw the Prophet
carrying earth, and the earth was covering the whiteness of his abdomen.
And he was saying, "Without You (O Allah!) we would have got no
guidance, nor given in charity, nor prayed. So please bless us with
tranquility and make firm our feet when we meet our enemies.

Indeed (these) people have rebelled against (oppressed) us but never
shall we yield if they try to bring affliction upon us."

Prophet. (See ...](bh4_92)
