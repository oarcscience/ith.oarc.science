### Hadith 4:319

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

That he and Abu Talha came in the company of the Prophet and Safiya was
accompanying the Prophet, who let her ride behind him on his she-camel.
During the journey, the she-camel slipped and both the Prophet and (his)
wife fell down. Abu Talha (the sub-narrator thinks that Anas said that
Abu Talha jumped from his camel quickly) said, "O Allah's Apostle! May
Allah sacrifice me for your sake! Did you get hurt?" The Prophet
replied,"No, but take care of the lady." Abu Talha covered his face with
his garment and proceeded towards her and covered her with his garment,
and she got up. He then set right the condition of their she-camel and
both of them (i.e. the Prophet and his wife) rode and proceeded till
they approached Medina. The Prophet said, "We are returning with
repentance and worshipping and praising our Lord." The Prophet kept on
saying this statement till he entered Medina.
