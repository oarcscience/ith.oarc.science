### Hadith 4:193

*Narrated Anas:*

Whenever Allah's Apostle attacked some people, he would never attack
them till it was dawn. If he heard the Adhan (i.e. call for prayer) he
would delay the fight, and if he did not hear the Adhan, he would attack
them immediately after dawn. We reached Khaibar at night.
