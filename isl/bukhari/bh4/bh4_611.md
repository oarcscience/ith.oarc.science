### Hadith 4:608

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

The Prophet said, "One should not say that I am better than Jonah (i.e.
Yunus) bin Matta." So, he mentioned his father Matta. The Prophet
mentioned the night of his Ascension and said, "The prophet Moses was
brown, a tall person as if from the people of the tribe of Shanu'a.
Jesus was a curly-haired man of moderate height." He also mentioned
Malik, the gate-keeper of the (Hell) Fire, and Ad-Dajjal.
