### Hadith 4:250

*Narrated Ibn Abbas:*

That he heard the Prophet saying, "It is not permissible for a man to be
alone with a woman, and no lady should travel except with a Muhram (i.e.
her husband or a person whom she cannot marry in any case for ever; e.g.
her father, brother, etc.)." Then a man got up and said, "O Allah's
Apostle! I have enlisted in the army for such-and-such Ghazwa and my
wife is proceeding for Hajj." Allah's Apostle said, "Go, and perform the
Hajj with your wife."
