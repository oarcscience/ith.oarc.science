### Hadith 4:51

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "A place in Paradise as small as a bow is better than
all that on which the sun rises and sets (i.e. all the world)." He also
said, "A single endeavor in Allah's Cause in the afternoon or in the
forenoon is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets."
