### Hadith 4:98

*Narrated Ibn Aun:*

Once Musa bin Anas while describing the battle of Yamama, said, "Anas
bin Malik went to Thabit bin Qais, who had lifted his clothes from his
thighs and was applying Hunut to his body. Anas asked, 'O Uncle! What is
holding you back (from the battle)?' He replied, 'O my nephew! I am
coming just now,' and went on perfuming himself with Hunut, then he came
and sat (in the row). Anas then mentioned that the people fled from the
battle-field. On that Thabit said, 'Clear the way for me to fight the
enemy. We would never do so (i.e. flee) in the company of Allah's
Apostle. How bad the habits you have acquired from your enemies!"

about the enemy ...](bh4_100.md)
