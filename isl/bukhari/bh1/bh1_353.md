### Hadith 1:353

*Narrated Abu Murra:*

(the freed slave of Um Hani) Um Hani, the daughter of Abi Talib said, "I
went to Allah's Apostle in the year of the conquest of Mecca and found
him taking a bath and his daughter Fatima was screening him. I greeted
him. He asked, 'Who is she?' I replied, 'I am Um Hani bint Abi Talib.'
He said, 'Welcome! O Um Hani.' When he finished his bath he stood up and
prayed eight Rak at while wearing a single garment wrapped round his
body and when he finished I said, 'O Allah's Apostle ! My brother has
told me that he will kill a person whom I gave shelter and that person
is so and so the son of Hubaira.' The Prophet said, 'We shelter the
person whom you have sheltered.' " Um Ham added, "And that was before
noon (Duha)."
