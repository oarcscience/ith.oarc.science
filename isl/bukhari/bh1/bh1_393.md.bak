### Hadith 1:392

*Narrated Bara' bin 'Azib:*

Allah's Apostle prayed facing Baitul-Maqdis for sixteen or seventeen
months but he loved to face the Ka'ba (at Mecca) so Allah revealed:
"Verily, We have seen the turning of your face to the heaven!" (2:144)
So the Prophet faced the Ka'ba and the fools amongst the people namely
"the Jews" said, "What has turned them from their Qibla (Bait-ul-Maqdis)
which they formerly observed"" (Allah revealed): "Say: 'To Allah belongs
the East and the West. He guides whom he will to a straight path'."
(2:142) A man prayed with the Prophet (facing the Ka'ba) and went out.
He saw some of the Ansar praying the 'Asr prayer with their faces
towards Bait-ul-Maqdis, he said, "I bear witness that I prayed with
Allah's Apostle facing the Ka'ba." So all the people turned their faces
towards the Ka'ba.
