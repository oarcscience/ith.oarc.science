Allah's Apostle said, "(A believer) who accompanies the funeral
procession of a Muslim out of sincere faith and hoping to attain Allah's
reward and remains with it till the funeral prayer is offered and the
burial ceremonies are over, he will return with a reward of two Qirats.
Each Qirat is like the size of the (Mount) Uhud. He who offers the

reward of one Qirat only."
