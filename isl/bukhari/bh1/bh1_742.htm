The Prophet set out with the intention of going to Suq 'Ukaz (market 
of 'Ukaz) along with some of his companions. At the same time, a 
barrier was put between the devils and the news of heaven. Fire 
commenced to be thrown at them. The Devils went to their people, who 
asked them, "What is wrong with you?" They said, "A barrier has been 
placed between us and the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at 
us." They said, "The thing which has put a barrier between you and the
news of heaven must be something which has happened recently. Go 
eastward and westward and see what has put a barrier between you and 
the news of heaven." Those who went towards Tuhama came across the 
Prophet at a place called Nakhla and it was on the way to Suq 'Ukaz 
and the Prophet was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When
they heard the Qur'an they listened to it and said, "By Allah, this is
the thing which has put a barrier between us and the news of heaven." 
They went to their people and said, "O our people; verily we have 
heard a wonderful recital (Qur'an) which shows the true path; we 
believed in it and would not ascribe partners to our Lord." Allah 
revealed the following verses to his Prophet (Sura 'Jinn') (72): "Say:
It has been revealed to me." And what was revealed to him was the 
conversation of the Jinns.
