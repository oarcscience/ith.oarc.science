### Hadith 1:219

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

A Bedouin stood up and started making water in the mosque. The people
caught him but the Prophet ordered them to leave him and to pour a
bucket or a tumbler of water over the place where he had passed the
urine. The Prophet then said, "You have been sent to make things easy
and not to make them difficult."
