*Narrated Abu Burda's father:*

Allah's Apostle said "Three persons will have a double reward:

1\. A Person from the people of the scriptures who believed in his
prophet (Jesus or Moses) and then believed in the Prophet Muhammad (i

2\. A slave who discharges his duties to Allah and his master.

3\. A master of a woman-slave who teaches her good manners and educates

marries her."
