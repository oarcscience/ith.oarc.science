### Hadith 1:15

*Narrated Anas:*

The Prophet said, "Whoever possesses the following three qualities will
have the sweetness (delight) of faith:

1\. The one to whom Allah and His Apostle becomes dearer than anything
else.

2\. Who loves a person and he loves him only for Allah's sake.

3\. Who hates to revert to Atheism (disbelief) as he hates to be thrown
into the fire."
