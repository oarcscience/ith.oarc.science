### Hadith 1:454

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Two of the companions of the Prophet departed from him on a dark night
and were led by two lights like lamps (going in front of them from Allah
as a miracle) lighting the way in front of them, and when they parted,
each of them was accompanied by one of these lights till he reached
their (respective) houses.
