### Hadith 1:574

*Narrated Qurra bin Khalid:*

Once he waited for Al-Hasan and he did not show up till it was about the
usual time for him to start his speech; then he came and apologized
saying, "Our neighbors invited us." Then he added, or about midnight. He
came and led the prayer, and after finishing it, he addressed us and

as long as you were waiting for it." Al-Hasan said, "The people are
regarded as performing good deeds as long as they are waiting for doing
good deeds." Al-Hasan's statement is a portion of Anas's Hadith from the
