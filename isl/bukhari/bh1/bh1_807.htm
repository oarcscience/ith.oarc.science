<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:805</H3><P><I>Narrated Warrad:</I></P>
(the clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba) Once Al-Mughira dictated to me in
a letter addressed to Mu'awiya that the Prophet used to say after 
every compulsory prayer, "La ilaha ilallah wahdahu la sharika lahu, 
lahul-mulku wa-lahul-hamdu, wahuwa ala kulli shai in qadir. Allahumma 
la mani 'a lima a'taita, wa la mu'tiya lima mana'ta, wa la yanfa'u 
dhal-jaddi minka-l-jadd. (None has the right to be worshipped but 
Allah and He has no partner in Lordship or in worship or in the Names 
and the Qualities, and for Him is the Kingdom and all the praises are 
for Him and He is omnipotent. O Allah! Nobody can hold back what you 
give and nobody can give what You hold back. Hard (efforts by anyone 
for anything cannot benefit one against Your Will)." And Al-Hasan 
said, "Al-jadd' means prosperity."
