We came to the Prophet and stayed with him for twenty days and nights.
We were all young and of about the same age. The Prophet was very kind
and merciful. When he realized our longing for our families, he asked 
about our homes and the people there and we told him. Then he asked us
to go back to our families and stay with them and teach them (the 
religion) and to order them to do good things. He also mentioned some 
other things which I have (remembered or) forgotten. The Prophet then 
added, "Pray as you have seen me praying and when it is the time for 
the prayer one of you should pronounce the Adhan and the oldest of you
should lead the prayer.
