The Prophet once offered the eclipse prayer. He stood for a long time 
and then did a prolonged bowing. He stood up straight again and kept 
on standing for a long time, then bowed a long bowing and then stood 
up straight and then prostrated a prolonged prostration and then 
lifted his head and prostrated a prolonged prostration. And then he 
stood up for a long time and then did a prolonged bowing and then 
stood up straight again and kept on standing for a long time. Then he 
bowed a long bowing and then stood up straight and then prostrated a 
prolonged prostration and then lifted his head and went for a 
prolonged prostration. On completion o the prayer, he said, "Paradise 
became s near to me that if I had dared, I would have plucked one of 
its bunches for you and Hell became so near to me that said, 'O my 
Lord will I be among those people?' Then suddenly I saw a woman and a 
cat was lacerating her with it claws. On inquiring, it was said that 
the woman had imprisoned the cat till it died of starvation and she 
neither fed it no freed it so that it could feed itself."
