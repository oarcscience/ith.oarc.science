My father said, "I heard Allah's Apostle saying, 'The period of your 
stay as compared to the previous nations is like the period equal to 
the time between the 'Asr prayer and sunset. The people of the Torah 
were given the Torah and they acted (upon it) till mid-day then they 
were exhausted and were given one Qirat (of gold) each. And then the 
people of the Gospel were given the Gospel and they acted (upon it) 
till the 'Asr prayer then they were exhausted and were! given one 
Qirat each. And then we were given the Qur'an and we acted (upon it) 
till sunset and we were given two Qirats each. On that the people of 
both the scriptures said, 'O our Lord! You have given them two Qirats 
and given us one Qirat, though we have worked more than they.' Allah 
said, 'Have I usurped some of your right?' They said, 'No.' Allah 
said: "That is my blessing I bestow upon whomsoever I wish."
