### Hadith 1:671

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "If anyone of you leads the people in the prayer,
he should shorten it for amongst them are the weak, the sick and the
old; and if anyone among your prays alone then he may prolong (the
prayer) as much as he wishes. "

[Next: 1:672: Abu Mas'ud: A man came and said, O Allah's Apostle! I keep
away from the morning ...](bh1_674)
