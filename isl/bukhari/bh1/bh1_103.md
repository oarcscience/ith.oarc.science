### Hadith 1:103

*Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:*

Whenever 'Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) heard anything which she did
not understand, she used to ask again till she understood it completely.
Aisha said: "Once the Prophet said, "Whoever will be called to account
(about his deeds on the Day of Resurrection) will surely be punished." I
said, "Doesn't Allah say: "He surely will receive an easy reckoning."
(84.8) The Prophet replied, "This means only the presentation of the
accounts but whoever will be argued about his account, will certainly be
ruined."
