Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari used to lay great stress on the question of 
urination and he used to say, "If anyone from Bani Israel happened to 
soil his clothes with urine, he used to cut that portion away." 
Hearing that, Hudhaifa said to Abu Wail, "I wish he (Abu Musa) didn't 
(lay great stress on that matter)." Hudhaifa added, "Allah's Apostle 
went to the dumps of some people and urinated while standing."
