### Hadith 1:83

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Amr bin Al 'Aas:*

Allah's Apostle stopped (for a while near the Jimar) at Mina during his
last Hajj for the people and they were asking him questions. A man came
and said, "I forgot and got my head shaved before slaughtering the Hadi
(sacrificing animal)." The Prophet said, "There is no harm, go and do
the slaughtering now." Then another person came and said, "I forgot and
slaughtered (the camel) before Rami (throwing of the pebbles) at the
Jamra." The Prophet said, "Do the Rami now and there is no harm."

The narrator added: So on that day, when the Prophet was asked about
anything (as regards the ceremonies of Hajj) performed before or after
its due time, his reply was: "Do it (now) and there is no harm."
