### Hadith 1:342

*Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:*

I was with 'Abdullah and Abu Musa; the latter asked the former, "O Abu
AbdurRahman! What is your opinion if somebody becomes Junub and no water
is available?" 'Abdullah replied, "Do not pray till water is found." Abu
Musa said, "What do you say about the statement of 'Ammar (who was
ordered by the Prophet to perform Tayammum). The Prophet said to him:
"Perform Tayammum and that would be sufficient." 'Abdullah replied,
"Don't you see that 'Umar was not satisfied by 'Ammar's statement?" Abu-
Musa said, "All right, leave 'Ammalr's statement, but what will you say
about this verse (of Tayammum)?" 'Abqiullah kept quiet and then said,
"If we allowed it, then they would probably perform Tayammum even if
water was available, if one of them found it (water) cold." The narrator
added, "I said to Shaqrq, "Then did 'Abdullah dislike to perform
Tayammum because of this?" He replied, "Yes."
