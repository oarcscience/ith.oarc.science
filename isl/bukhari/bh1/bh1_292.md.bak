### Hadith 1:292

*Narrated Ubai bin Ka'b:*

I asked Allah's Apostle about a man who engages in sexual intercourse
with his wife but does not discharge. He replied, "He should wash the
parts which comes in contact with the private parts of the woman,
perform ablution and then pray." (Abu 'Abdullah said, "Taking a bath is
safer and is the last order.")
