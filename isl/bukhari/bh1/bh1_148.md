### Hadith 1:148

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

The wives of the Prophet used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place
(near Baqia at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. 'Umar used
to say to the Prophet "Let your wives be veiled," but Allah's Apostle
did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam'a the wife of the Prophet went
out at 'Isha' time and she was a tall lady. 'Umar addressed her and
said, "I have recognized you, O Sauda." He said so, as he desired
eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the
Muslim women) may be revealed. So Allah revealed the verses of
"Al-Hijab" (A complete body cover excluding the eyes).
