### Hadith 1:575

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:*

The Prophet prayed one of the'lsha' prayer in his last days and after
finishing it with Taslim, he stood up and said, "Do you realize (the
importance of) this night? Nobody present on the

surface of the earth to-night would be living after the completion of
one hundred years from this night."

The people made a mistake in grasping the meaning of this statement of
Allah's Apostle and they indulged in those things which are said about
these narrators (i.e. some said that the Day of Resurrection will be
established after 100 years etc.) But the Prophet said, "Nobody present
on the surface of earth tonight would be living after the completion of
100 years from this night"; he meant "When that century (people of that
century) would pass away."
