<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:367</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdul 'Aziz:</I></P>
Anas said, 'When Allah's Apostle invaded Khaibar, we offered the Fajr 
prayer there yearly in the morning) when it was still dark. The 
Prophet rode and Abu Talha rode too and I was riding behind Abu Talha.
The Prophet passed through the lane of Khaibar quickly and my knee was
touching the thigh of the Prophet . He uncovered his thigh and I saw 
the whiteness of the thigh of the Prophet. When he entered the town, 
he said, 'Allahu Akbar! Khalbar is ruined. Whenever we approach near a
(hostile) nation (to fight) then evil will be the morning of those who
have been warned.' He repeated this thrice. The people came out for 
their jobs and some of them said, 'Muhammad (has come).' (Some of our 
companions added, "With his army.") We conquered Khaibar, took the 
captives, and the booty was collected. Dihya came and said, 'O Allah's
Prophet! Give me a slave girl from the captives.' The Prophet said, 
'Go and take any slave girl.' He took Safiya bint Huyai. A man came to
the Prophet and said, 'O Allah's Apostles! You gave Safiya bint Huyai 
to Dihya and she is the chief mistress of the tribes of Quraiza and 
An-Nadir and she befits none but you.' So the Prophet said, 'Bring him
along with her.' So Dihya came with her and when the Prophet saw her, 
he said to Dihya, 'Take any slave girl other than her from the 
captives.' Anas added: The Prophet then manumitted her and married 
her."
<P>
Thabit asked Anas, "O Abu Hamza! What did the Prophet pay her (as 
Mahr)?" He said, "Her self was her Mahr for he manumitted her and then
married her." Anas added, "While on the way, Um Sulaim dressed her for
marriage (ceremony) and at night she sent her as a bride to the 
Prophet . So the Prophet was a bridegroom and he said, 'Whoever has 
anything (food) should bring it.' He spread out a leather sheet (for 
the food) and some brought dates and others cooking butter. (I think 
he (Anas) mentioned As-SawTq). So they prepared a dish of Hais (a kind
of meal). And that was Walrma (the marriage banquet) of Allah's 
Apostle ."
