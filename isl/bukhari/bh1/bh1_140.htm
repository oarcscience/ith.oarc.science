Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet slept till he snored and then prayed (or
probably lay till his breath sounds were heard and then got up and 
prayed)." Ibn 'Abbas added: "I stayed overnight in the house of my 
aunt, Maimuna, the Prophet slept for a part of the night, (See 
Fateh-al-Bari page 249, Vol. 1), and late in the night, he got up and 
performed ablution from a hanging water skin, a light (perfect) 
ablution and stood up for the prayer. I, too, performed a similar 
ablution, then I went and stood on his left. He drew me to his right 
and prayed as much as Allah wished, and again lay and slept till his 
breath sounds were heard. Later on the Mua'dhdhin (callmaker for the 
prayer) came to him and informed him that it was time for Prayer. The 
Prophet went with him for the prayer without performing a new 
ablution." (Sufyan said to 'Amr that some people said, "The eyes of 
Allah's Apostle sleep but his heart does not sleep." 'Amr replied, "I 
heard 'Ubaid bin 'Umar saying that the dreams of Prophets were Divine 
Inspiration, and then he recited the verse: 'I (Abraham) see in a 
dream, (O my son) that I offer you in sacrifice (to Allah)." (37.102) 
(See Hadith No. 183)
