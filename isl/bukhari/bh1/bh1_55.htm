<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:56</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
While the Prophet was saying something in a gathering, a Bedouin came 
and asked him, "When would the Hour (Doomsday) take place?" Allah's 
Apostle continued his talk, so some people said that Allah's Apostle 
had heard the question, but did not like what that Bedouin had asked. 
Some of them said that Alllah's Apostle had not heard it. When the 
Prophet finished his speech, he said, "Where is the questioner, who 
enquired about the Hour (Doomsday)?" The Bedouin said, "I am here, O 
Allah's Apostle ." Then the Prophet said, "When honesty is lost, then 
wait for the Hour (Doomsday)." The Bedouin said, "How will that be 
lost?" The Prophet said, "When the power or authority comes in the 
hands of unfit persons, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday.)"
