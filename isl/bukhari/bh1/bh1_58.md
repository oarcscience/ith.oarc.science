### Hadith 1:59

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

The Prophet said, "Amongst the trees, there is a tree, the leaves of
which do not fall and is like a Muslim. Tell me the name of that tree."
Everybody started thinking about the trees of the desert areas. And I
thought of the date-palm tree. The others then asked, "Please inform us
what is that tree, O Allah's Apostle?" He replied, "It is the date-palm
tree."
