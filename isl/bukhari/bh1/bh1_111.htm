Abu Juhaifa said, "I asked Ali, 'Have you got any book (which has been
revealed to the Prophet apart from the Qur'an)?' 'Ali replied, 'No, 
except Allah's Book or the power of understanding which has been 
bestowed (by Allah) upon a Muslim or what is (written) in this sheet 
of paper (with me).' Abu Juhaifa said, "I asked, 'What is (written) in
this sheet of paper?' Ali replied, it deals with The Diyya 
(compensation (blood money) paid by the killer to the relatives of the
victim), the ransom for the releasing of the captives from the hands 
of the enemies, and the law that no Muslim should be killed in Qisas 
(equality in punishment) for the killing of (a disbeliever).
