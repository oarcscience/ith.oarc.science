<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:506</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "If there was a river at the door of 
anyone of you and he took a bath in it five times a day would you 
notice any dirt on him?" They said, "Not a trace of dirt would be 
left." The Prophet added, "That is the example of the five prayers 
with which Allah blots out (annuls) evil deeds."
