### Hadith 1:814

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

The Prophet said, "Whoever eats garlic or onion should keep away from
our mosque or should remain in his house." (Jabir bin 'Abdullah, in
another narration said, "Once a big pot containing cooked vegetables was
brought. On finding unpleasant smell coming from it, the Prophet asked,
'What is in it?' He was told all the names of the vegetables that were
in it. The Prophet ordered that it should be brought near to some of his
companions who were with him. When the Prophet saw it he disliked to eat
it and said, 'Eat. (I don't eat) for I converse with those whom you
don't converse with (i.e. the angels)."
