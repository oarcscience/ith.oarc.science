*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

I asked the Prophet "Which deed is the dearest to Allah?" He replied,
"To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed times." I asked, "What

'To participate in Jihad (religious fighting) in Allah's cause."
'Abdullah added, "I asked only that much and if I had asked more, the
Prophet would have told me more."
