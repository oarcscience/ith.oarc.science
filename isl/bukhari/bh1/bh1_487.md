### Hadith 1:485

*Narrated Nafi:*

"The Prophet used to make his she-camel sit across and he would pray
facing it (as a Sutra)." I asked, "What would the Prophet do if the
she-camel was provoked and moved?" He said, "He would take its
camel-saddle and put it in front of him and pray facing its back part
(as a Sutra). And Ibn 'Umar used to do the same." (This indicates that
one should not pray except behind a Sutra).
