### Hadith 1:66

*Narrated Abu Waqid Al-Laithi:*

While Allah's Apostle was sitting in the mosque with some people, three
men came. Two of them came in front of Allah's Apostle and the third one
went away. The two persons kept on standing before Allah's Apostle for a
while and then one of them found a place in the circle and sat there
while the other sat behind the gathering, and the third one went away.
When Allah's Apostle finished his preaching, he said, "Shall I tell you
about these three persons? One of them be-took himself to Allah, so
Allah took him into His grace and mercy and accommodated him, the second
felt shy from Allah, so Allah sheltered Him in His mercy (and did not
punish him), while the third turned his face from Allah and went away,
so Allah turned His face from him likewise. "
