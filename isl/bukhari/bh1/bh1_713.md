### Hadith 1:711

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle used to keep silent between the Takbir and the
recitation of Qur'an and that interval of silence used to be a short
one. I said to the Prophet "May my parents be sacrificed for you! What
do you say in the pause between Takbir and recitation?" The Prophet
said, "I say, 'Allahumma, ba'id baini wa baina khatayaya kama ba'adta
baina-l-mashriqi wa-l-maghrib. Allahumma, naqqim min khatayaya kama
yunaqqa-ththawbu-l-abyadu mina-ddanas. Allahumma, ighsil khatayaya
bil-ma'i wa-th-thalji wal-barad (O Allah! Set me apart from my sins
(faults) as the East and West are set apart from each other and clean me
from sins as a white garment is cleaned of dirt (after thorough
washing). O Allah! Wash off my sins with water, snow and hail.)"
