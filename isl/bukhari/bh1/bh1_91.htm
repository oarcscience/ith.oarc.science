<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:92</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Musa:</I></P>
The Prophet was asked about things which he did not like, but when the
questioners insisted, the Prophet got angry. He then said to the 
people, "Ask me anything you like." A man asked, "Who is my father?" 
The Prophet replied, "Your father is Hudhafa." Then another man got up
and said, "Who is my father, O Allah's Apostle ?" He replied, "Your 
father is Salim, Maula (the freed slave) of Shaiba." So when 'Umar saw
that (the anger) on the face of the Prophet he said, "O Allah's 
Apostle! We repent to Allah (Our offending you)."
