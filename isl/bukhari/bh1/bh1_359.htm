Once I was traveling with the Prophet and he said, "O Mughira! take 
this container of water." I took it and Allah's Apostle went far away 
till he disappeared. He answered the call of nature and was wearing a

was very tight so he took out his hands from under it. I poured water 
and he performed ablution like that for prayers and passed his wet 
hands over his Khuff (leather socks) and then prayed .
