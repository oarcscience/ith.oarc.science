### Hadith 1:822

*Narrated 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Abis:*

A person asked Ibn Abbas, "Have you ever presented yourself at the ('Id)
prayer with Allah's Apostle?" He replied, "Yes." And had it not been for
my kinship (position) with the Prophet it would not have been possible
for me to do so (for he was too young). The Prophet went to the mark
near the house of Kathir bin As-Salt and delivered a sermon. He then
went towards the women. He advised and reminded them and asked them to
give alms. So the woman would bring her hand near her neck and take off
her necklace and put it in the garment of Bilal. Then the Prophet and
Bilal came to the house."
