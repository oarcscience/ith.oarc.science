### Hadith 1:140

*Narrated Kuraib:*

Ibn 'Abbas said, "The Prophet slept till he snored and then prayed (or
probably lay till his breath sounds were heard and then got up and
prayed)." Ibn 'Abbas added: "I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt,
Maimuna, the Prophet slept for a part of the night, (See Fateh-al-Bari
page 249, Vol. 1), and late in the night, he got up and performed
ablution from a hanging water skin, a light (perfect) ablution and stood
up for the prayer. I, too, performed a similar ablution, then I went and
stood on his left. He drew me to his right and prayed as much as Allah
wished, and again lay and slept till his breath sounds were heard. Later
on the Mua'dhdhin (callmaker for the prayer) came to him and informed
him that it was time for Prayer. The Prophet went with him for the
prayer without performing a new ablution." (Sufyan said to 'Amr that
some people said, "The eyes of Allah's Apostle sleep but his heart does
not sleep." 'Amr replied, "I heard 'Ubaid bin 'Umar saying that the
dreams of Prophets were Divine Inspiration, and then he recited the
verse: 'I (Abraham) see in a dream, (O my son) that I offer you in
sacrifice (to Allah)." (37.102) (See Hadith No. 183)
