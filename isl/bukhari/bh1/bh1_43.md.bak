### Hadith 1:44

*Narrated Talha bin 'Ubaidullah:*

A man from Najd with unkempt hair came to Allah's Apostle and we heard
his loud voice but could not understand what he was saying, till he came
near and then we came to know that he was asking about Islam. Allah's
Apostle said, "You have to offer prayers perfectly five times in a day
and night (24 hours)." The man asked, "Is there any more (praying)?"
Allah's Apostle replied, "No, but if you want to offer the Nawafil
prayers (you can)." Allah's Apostle further said to him: "You have to
observe fasts during the month of Ramad, an." The man asked, "Is there
any more fasting?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, but if you want to
observe the Nawafil fasts (you can.)" Then Allah's Apostle further said
to him, "You have to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity)." The man asked,
"Is there any thing other than the Zakat for me to pay?" Allah's Apostle
replied, "No, unless you want to give alms of your own." And then that
man retreated saying, "By Allah! I will neither do less nor more than
this." Allah's Apostle said, "If what he said is true, then he will be
successful (i.e. he will be granted Paradise)."
