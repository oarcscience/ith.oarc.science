### Hadith 1:316

*Narrated 'Urwa:*

'Aisha said, "We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj. Some of us
intended to perform 'Umra while others Hajj. When we reached Mecca,
Allah's Apostle said, 'Those who had assumed the lhram for'Umra and had
not brought the Hadi should finish his lhram and whoever had assumed the
Ihram for 'Umra and brought the Hadi should not finish the Ihram till he
has slaughtered his Hadi and whoever had assumed the lhram for Hajj
should complete his Hajj." 'Aisha further said, "I got my periods
(menses) and kept on menstruating till the day of 'Arafat, and I had
assumed the Ihram for 'Umra only (Tamattu'). The Prophet ordered me to
undo and comb my head hair and assume the lhram for Hajj only and leave
the 'Umra. I did the same till I completed the Hajj. Then the Prophet
sent 'Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me and ordered me to perform 'Umra
from At-Tan'im in lieu of the missed 'Umra."
