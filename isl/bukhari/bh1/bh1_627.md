### Hadith 1:625

*Narrated Humaid:*

Anas said, "The Prophet said, 'O Bani Salima! Don't you think that for
every step of yours (that you take towards the mosque) there is a reward
(while coming for prayer)?" Mujahid said: "Regarding Allah's Statement:
"We record that which they have sent before (them), and their traces"
(36.12). 'Their traces' means 'their steps.' " And Anas said that the
people of Bani Salima wanted to shift to a place near the Prophet but
Allah's Apostle disliked the idea of leaving their houses uninhabited
and said, "Don't you think that you will get the reward for your
