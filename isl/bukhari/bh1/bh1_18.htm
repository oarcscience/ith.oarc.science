<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:19</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
Whenever Allah's Apostle ordered the Muslims to do something, he used 
to order them deeds which were easy for them to do, (according to 
their strength endurance). They said, "O Allah's Apostle! We are not 
like you. Allah  has forgiven your past and future sins." So Allah's 
Apostle became angry and it was apparent on his face. He said, "I am 
the most Allah fearing, and know Allah better than all of you do."
