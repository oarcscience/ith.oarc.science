### Hadith 1:672

*Narrated Abu Mas'ud:*

A man came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I keep away from the morning
prayer because so-and-so (Imam) prolongs it too much." Allah's Apostle
became furious and I had never seen him more furious than he was on that
day. The Prophet said, "O people! Some of you make others dislike the
prayer, so whoever becomes an Imam he should shorten the prayer, as
behind him are the weak, the old and the needy.''
