<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:184</H3><P><I>Narrated Asma' bint Abu Bakr:</I></P>
I came to 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet during the solar eclipse. The
people were standing and offering the prayer and she was also praying.
I asked her, "What is wrong with the people?" She beckoned with her 
hand towards the sky and said, "Subhan Allah." I asked her, "Is there 
a sign?" She pointed out, "Yes." So I, too, stood for the prayer till 
I fell unconscious and later on I poured water on my head. After the 
prayer, Allah's Apostle praised and glorified Allah and said, "Just 
now I have seen something which I never saw before at this place of 
mine, including Paradise and Hell. I have been inspired (and have 
understood) that you will be put to trials in your graves and these 
trials will be like the trials of Ad-Dajjal, or nearly like it (the 
sub narrator is not sure of what Asma' said). Angels will come to 
every one of you and ask, 'What do you know about this man?' A 
believer will reply, 'He is Muhammad, Allah's Apostle , and he came to
us with self-evident truth and guidance. So we accepted his teaching, 
believed and followed him.' Then the angels will say to him to sleep 
in peace as they have come to know that he was a believer. On the 
other hand a hypocrite or a doubtful person will reply, 'I do not know
but heard the people saying something and so I said the same.' "
