*Narrated Abu Qilaba:*

Anas said, "Some people of 'Ukl or 'Uraina tribe came to Medina and its
climate did not suit them. So the Prophet ordered them to go to the herd
of (Milch) camels and to drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). So
they went as directed and after they became healthy, they killed the
shepherd of the Prophet and drove away all the camels. The news reached
the Prophet early in the morning and he sent (men) in their pursuit and
they were captured and brought at noon. He then ordered to cut their
hands and feet (and it was done), and their eyes were branded with
heated pieces of iron, They were put in 'Al-Harra' and when they asked
for water, no water was given to them." Abu Qilaba said, "Those people
committed theft and murder, became infidels after embracing Islam and
fought against Allah and His Apostle ."
