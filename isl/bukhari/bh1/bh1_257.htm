I placed water for the bath of the Prophet. He washed his hands twice 
or thrice and then poured water on his left hand and washed his 
private parts. He rubbed his hands over the earth (and cleaned them), 
rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and blowing 
it out, washed his face and both forearms and then poured water over 
his body. Then he withdrew from that place and washed his feet.
