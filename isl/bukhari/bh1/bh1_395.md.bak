### Hadith 1:394

*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

The Prophet prayed (and the subnarrator Ibrahim said, "I do not know
whether he prayed more or less than usual"), and when he had finished
the prayers he was asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Has there been any change
in the prayers?" He said, "What is it?' The people said, "You have
prayed so much and so much." So the Prophet bent his legs, faced the
Qibla and performed two prostrations (of Sahu) and finished his prayers
with Tasiim (by turning his face to right and left saying:
'As-Salamu'Alaikum-Warahmat-ullah'). When he turned his face to us he
said, "If there had been anything changed in the prayer, surely I would
have informed you but I am a human being like you and liable to forget
like you. So if I forget remind me and if anyone of you is doubtful
about his prayer, he should follow what he thinks to be correct and
complete his prayer accordingly and finish it and do two prostrations
(of Sahu)."
