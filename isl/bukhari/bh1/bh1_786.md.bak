### Hadith 1:784

*Narrated Thabit:*

Anas said, "I will leave no stone unturned in making you offer the
prayer as I have seen the Prophet making us offer it." Anas used to do a
thing which I have not seen you doing. He used to stand after the bowing
for such a long time that one would think that he had forgotten (the
prostrations) and he used to sit in-between the prostrations so long
that one would think that he had forgotten the second prostration.

[Next: 1:785: Anas bin Malik: The Prophet said, Be straight in the
prostrations and none of you ...](bh1_787.md)
