### Hadith 1:739

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Qur'an is recited in every prayer and in those prayers in which
Allah's Apostle recited aloud for us, we recite aloud in the same
prayers for you; and the prayers in which the Prophet recited quietly,
we recite quietly. If you recite "Al-Fatiha" only it is sufficient but
if you recite something else in addition, it is better.

going to Suq 'Ukaz (market ...](bh1_742)
