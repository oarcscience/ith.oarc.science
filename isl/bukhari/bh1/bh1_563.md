### Hadith 1:561

*Narrated Muawiya:*

You offer a prayer which I did not see being offered by Allah's Apostle
when we were in his company and he certainly had forbidden it (i.e. two
Rakat after the Asr prayer).

[Next: 1:562: Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle forbade the offering of two
prayers:...](bh1_564)
