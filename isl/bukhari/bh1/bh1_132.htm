<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:132</H3><P><I>Narrated Um Salama:</I></P>
Um-Sulaim came to Allah's Apostle and said, "Verily, Allah is not shy 
of (telling you) the truth. Is it necessary for a woman to take a bath
after she has a wet dream (nocturnal sexual discharge?) The Prophet 
replied, "Yes, if she notices a discharge." Um Salama, then covered 
her face and asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Does a woman get a discharge?"
He replied, "Yes, let your right hand be in dust (An Arabic expression
you say to a person when you contradict his statement meaning "you 
will not achieve goodness"), and that is why the son resembles his 
mother."
