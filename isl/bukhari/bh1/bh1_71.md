### Hadith 1:72

*Narrated Ibn 'Umar:*

We were with the Prophet and a spadix of date-palm tree was brought to
him. On that he said, "Amongst the trees, there is a tree which
resembles a Muslim." I wanted to say that it was the date-palm tree but
as I was the youngest of all (of them) I kept quiet. And then the
Prophet said, "It is the date-palm tree."

like anyone except in two cases. ...](bh1_72.md)
