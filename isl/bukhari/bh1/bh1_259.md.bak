### Hadith 1:259

*Narrated Maimuna:*

I placed water for the bath of the Prophet and he poured water with his
right hand on his left and washed them. Then he washed his private parts
and rubbed his hands on the ground, washed them with water, rinsed his
mouth and washed his nose by putting water in it and blowing it out,
washed his face and poured water on his head. He withdrew from that
place and washed his feet. A piece of cloth (towel) was given to him but
he did not use it.

[Next: 1:260: Maimuna: The Prophet took the bath of Janaba. (sexual
relation or wet dream). ...](bh1_260.md)
