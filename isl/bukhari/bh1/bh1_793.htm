I was sitting with some of the companions of Allah's Apostle and we 
were discussing about the way of praying of the Prophet. Abu Humaid 
As-Saidi said, "I remember the prayer of Allah's Apostle better than 
any one of you. I saw him raising both his hands up to the level of 
the shoulders on saying the Takbir; and on bowing he placed his hands 
on both knees and bent his back straight, then he stood up straight 
from bowing till all the vertebrate took their normal positions. In 
prostrations, he placed both his hands on the ground with the forearms
away from the ground and away from his body, and his toes were facing 
the Qibla. On sitting In the second Rak'a he sat on his left foot and 
propped up the right one; and in the last Rak'a he pushed his left 
foot forward and kept the other foot propped up and sat over the 
buttocks "
