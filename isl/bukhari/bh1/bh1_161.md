### Hadith 1:161

*Narrated Humran:*

(the slave of 'Uthman) I saw 'Uthman bin 'Affan asking for a tumbler of
water (and when it was brought) he poured water over his hands and
washed them thrice and then put his right hand in the water container
and rinsed his mouth, washed his nose by putting water in it and then
blowing it out. then he washed his face and forearrlns up to the elbows
thrice, passed his wet hands over his head and washed his feet up to the
ankles thrice. Then he said, "Allah's Apostle said 'If anyone Performs
ablution like that of mine and offers a two-rak'at prayer during which
he does not think of anything else (not related to the present prayer)
then his past sins will be forgiven.' " After performing the ablution
'Uthman said, "I am going to tell you a Hadith which I would not have
told you, had I not been compelled by a certain Holy Verse (the sub
narrator 'Urwa said: This verse is: "Verily, those who conceal the clear
signs and the guidance which we have sent down...)" (2:159). I heard the
Prophet saying, 'If a man performs ablution perfectly and then offers
the compulsory congregational prayer, Allah will forgive his sins
committed between that (prayer) and the (next) prayer till he offers it.
