### Hadith 1:183

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas:*

that he stayed overnight in the house of Maimuna the wife of the
Prophet, his aunt. He added : I lay on the bed (cushion transversally)
while Allah's Apostle and his wife lay in the length-wise direction of
the cushion. Allah's Apostle slept till the middle of the night, either
a bit before or a bit after it and then woke up, rubbing the traces of
sleep off his face with his hands. He then, recited the last ten verses
of Sura Al-Imran, got up and went to a hanging water-skin. He then
Performed the ablution from it and it was a perfect ablution, and then
stood up to offer the prayer. I, too, got up and did as the Prophet had
done. Then I went and stood by his side. He placed his right hand on my
head and caught my right ear and twisted it. He prayed two Rakat then
two Rakat and two Rakat and then two Rakat and then two Rakat and then
two Rakat (separately six times), and finally one Rak'a (the Witr). Then
he lay down again in the bed till the Mu'adhdhin came to him where upon
the Prophet got up, offered a two light Rakat prayer and went out and
led the Fajr prayer
