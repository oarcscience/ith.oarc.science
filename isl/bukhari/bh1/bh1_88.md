### Hadith 1:89

*Narrated 'Umar:*

My Ansari neighbor from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live at 'Awali
Al-Medina and used to visit the Prophet by turns. He used to go one day
and I another day. When I went I used to bring the news of that day
regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he
used to do the same for me. Once my Ansari friend, in his turn (on
returning from the Prophet), knocked violently at my door and asked if I
was there." I became horrified and came out to him. He said, "Today a
great thing has happened." I then went to Hafsa and saw her weeping. I
asked her, "Did Allah's Apostle divorce you all?" She replied, "I do not
know." Then, I entered upon the Prophet and said while standing, "Have
you divorced your wives?" The Prophet replied in the negative. On what I
said, "Allahu-Akbar (Allah is Greater)." (See Hadith No. 119, Vol. 3 for
details)
