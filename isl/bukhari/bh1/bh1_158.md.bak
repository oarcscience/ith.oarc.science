### Hadith 1:158

*Narrated 'Abdullah:*

The Prophet went out to answer the call of nature and asked me to bring
three stones. I found two stones and searched for the third but could
not find it. So took a dried piece of dung and brought it to him. He
took the two stones and threw away the dung and said, "This is a filthy
thing."
