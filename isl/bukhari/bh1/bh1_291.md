### Hadith 1:291

*Narrated Zaid bin Khalid AjJuhani:*

I asked 'Uthman bin 'Affan about a man who engaged in the sexual
intercourse with his wife but did not discharge. 'Uthman replied, "He
should perform ablution like that for the prayer after washing his
private parts." 'Uthman added, "I heard that from Allah's Apostle." I
asked 'Ali bin Abi Talib, Az-Zubair bin Al-'Awwam, Talha bin 'Ubaidullah
and Ubai bin Ka'b and a gave the same reply. (Abu Aiylub said that he
had heard that from Allah's Apostle ) (This order was cancelled later on
so one has to take a bath. See, Hadith No. 180).
