<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:87</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Jamra:</I></P>
I was an interpreter between the people and Ibn 'Abbas. Once Ibn 
'Abbas said that a delegation of the tribe of'Abdul Qais came to the 
Prophet who asked them, "Who are the people (i.e. you)? (Or) who are 
the delegates?" They replied, "We are from the tribe of Rabi'a." Then 
the Prophet said to them, "Welcome, O people (or said, "O delegation 
(of 'Abdul Qais).") Neither will you have disgrace nor will you 
regret." They said, "We have come to you from a distant place and 
there is the tribe of the infidels of Mudar intervening between you 
and us and we cannot come to you except in the sacred month. So please
order us to do something good (religious deeds) and that we may also 
inform our people whom we have left behind (at home) and that we may 
enter Paradise (by acting on them.)" The Prophet ordered them to do 
four things, and forbade them from four things. He ordered them to 
believe in Allah Alone, the Honorable the Majestic and said to them, 
"Do you know what is meant by believing in Allah Alone?" They replied,
"Allah and His Apostle know better." Thereupon the Prophet said, 
"(That means to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but 
Allah and that Muhammad is His Apostle, to offer prayers perfectly, to
pay Zakat, to observe fasts during the month of Ramadan, (and) to pay 
Al-Khumus (one fifth of the booty to be given in Allah's cause)." Then
he forbade them four things, namely Ad-Dubba.' Hantam, Muzaffat (and) 
An-Naqir or Muqaiyar(These were the names  of pots in which alcoholic 
drinks used to be prepared). The Prophet further said, "Memorize them 
(these instructions) and tell them to the people whom you have left 
behind."
