### Hadith 1:818

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

One night I slept at the house of my aunt Maimuna and the Prophet slept
(too). He got up (for prayer) in the last hours of the night and
performed a light ablution from a hanging leather skin. ('Amr, the
sub-narrator described that the ablution was very light). Then he stood
up for prayer and I got up too and performed the ablution in the same
way and joined him on his left side. He pulled me to the right and
prayed as much as Allah will. Then he lay down and slept and I heard his
breath sounds till the Mu'adh-dhin came to him to inform him about the
(Fajr) prayer. He left with him for the prayer and prayed without
repeating the ablution. (Sufyan the subnarrator said: We said to 'Amr,
"Some people say, 'The eyes of the Prophet sleep but his heart never
sleeps.' " 'Amr said, "'Ubai bin 'Umar said, 'The dreams of the Prophets
are Divine Inspirations. Then he recited, '(O my son), I have seen in
dream that I was slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice).")
