Once he waited for Al-Hasan and he did not show up till it was about 
the usual time for him to start his speech; then he came and 
apologized saying, "Our neighbors invited us." Then he added, 
or about midnight. He came and led the prayer, and after finishing it,
he addressed us and said, 'All the people prayed and then slept and 
you had been in prayer as long as you were waiting for it." Al-Hasan 
said, "The people are regarded as performing good deeds as long as 
they are waiting for doing good deeds." Al-Hasan's statement is a 
portion of Anas's Hadith from the Prophet .
