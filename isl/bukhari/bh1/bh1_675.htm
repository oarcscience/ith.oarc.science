Once a man was driving two Nadihas (camels used for agricultural 
purposes) and night had fallen. He found Mu'adh praying so he made his
camel kneel and joined Mu'adh in the prayer. The latter recited Surat 
'AlBaqara" or Surat "An-Nisa", (so) the man left the prayer and went 
away. When he came to know that Mu'adh had criticized him, he went to 
the Prophet, and complained against Mu'adh. The Prophet said thrice, 
"O Mu'adh ! Are you putting the people to trial?" It would have been 
better if you had recited "Sabbih Isma Rabbika-l-a-la (87)", 
Wash-Shamsi wadu-haha (91)", or "Wal-laili Idha yaghsha (92)", for the
old, the weak and the needy pray behind you." Jabir said that Mu'adh 
recited Sura Al-Baqara in the 'Isha' prayer.
