### Hadith 1:184

*Narrated Asma' bint Abu Bakr:*

I came to 'Aisha the wife of the Prophet during the solar eclipse. The
people were standing and offering the prayer and she was also praying. I
asked her, "What is wrong with the people?" She beckoned with her hand
towards the sky and said, "Subhan Allah." I asked her, "Is there a
sign?" She pointed out, "Yes." So I, too, stood for the prayer till I
fell unconscious and later on I poured water on my head. After the
prayer, Allah's Apostle praised and glorified Allah and said, "Just now
I have seen something which I never saw before at this place of mine,
including Paradise and Hell. I have been inspired (and have understood)
that you will be put to trials in your graves and these trials will be
like the trials of Ad-Dajjal, or nearly like it (the sub narrator is not
sure of what Asma' said). Angels will come to every one of you and ask,
'What do you know about this man?' A believer will reply, 'He is
Muhammad, Allah's Apostle , and he came to us with self-evident truth
and guidance. So we accepted his teaching, believed and followed him.'
Then the angels will say to him to sleep in peace as they have come to
know that he was a believer. On the other hand a hypocrite or a doubtful
person will reply, 'I do not know but heard the people saying something
and so I said the same.' "
