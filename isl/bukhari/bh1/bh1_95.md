### Hadith 1:96

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:*

Once Allah's Apostle remained behind us in a journey. He joined us while
we were performing ablution for the 'Asr prayer which was over-due. We
were just passing wet hands over our feet (not washing them properly) so
the Prophet addressed us in a loud voice and said twice or thrice, "Save
your heels from the fire."

[Next: 1:97: Abu Burda's father: Allah's Apostle said Three persons will
have a double reward:...](bh1_96.md)
