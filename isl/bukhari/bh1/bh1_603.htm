I came to the Prophet with some men from my tribe and stayed with him 
for twenty nights. He was kind and merciful to us. When he realized

your families and teach them the religion, and offer the prayer and 
one of you should pronounce the Adhan for the prayer when its time is 
due and the oldest one amongst you should lead the prayer."
