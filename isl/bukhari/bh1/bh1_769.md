### Hadith 1:767

*Narrated Aiyub:*

Abu Qilaba said, "Malik bin Huwairith used to demonstrate to us the
prayer of the Prophet at times other than that of the compulsory
prayers. So (once) he stood up for prayer and performed a perfect Qiyam
(standing and reciting from the Holy Qur'an) and then bowed and
performed bowing perfectly; then he raised his head and stood straight
for a while." Abu Qilaba added, "Malik bin Huwairith in that
demonstration prayed like this Sheikh of ours, Abu Yazid." Abu, Yazid
used to sit (for a while) on raising his head from the second
prostration before getting up.
