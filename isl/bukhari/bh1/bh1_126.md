### Hadith 1:126

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amar:*

I saw the Prophet near the Jamra and the people were asking him
questions (about religious problems). A man asked, "O Allah's Apostle! I
have slaughtered the Hadi (animal) before doing the Rami." The Prophet
replied, "Do the Rami (now) and there is no harm." Another person asked,
"O Allah's Apostle! I got my head shaved before slaughtering the
animal." The Prophet replied, "Do the slaughtering (now) and there is no
harm." So on that day, when the Prophet was asked about anything as
regards the ceremonies of Hajj performed before or after its due time
his reply was, "Do it (now) and there is no harm."
