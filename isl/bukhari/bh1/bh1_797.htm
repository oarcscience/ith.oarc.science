<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:795</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
(the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle used to invoke Allah in the 
prayer saying "Allahumma inni a'udhu bika min adhabil-qabri, wa a'udhu
bika min fitnatil-masihid-dajjal, wa a'udhu bika min fitnatil-mahya wa
fitnatil-mamati. Allahumma inni a'udhu bika minal-ma thami 
wal-maghrami. (O Allah, I seek refuge with You from the punishment of 
the grave and from the afflictions of Masi,h Ad-Dajjal and from the 
afflictions of life and death. O Allah, I seek refuge with You from 
the sins and from being in debt)." Somebody said to him, "Why do you 
so frequently seek refuge with Allah from being in debt?" The Prophet 
replied, "A person in debt tells lies whenever he speaks, and breaks 
promises whenever he makes (them)." 'Aisha also narrated: I heard 
Allah's Apostle in his prayer seeking refuge with Allah from the 
afflictions of Ad-dajjal.
