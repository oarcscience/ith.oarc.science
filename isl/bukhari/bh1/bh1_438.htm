<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:437</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar:</I></P>
In the life-time of Allah's Apostle the mosque was built of adobes, 
its roof of the leaves of date-palms and its pillars of the stems of 
date-palms. Abu Bakr did not alter it. 'Umar expanded it on the same 
pattern as it was in the lifetime of Allah's Apostle by using adobes, 
leaves of date-palms and changing the pillars into wooden ones. 
'Uthman changed it by expanding it to a great extent and built its 
walls with engraved stones and lime and made its pillars of engraved 
stones and its roof of teak wood.
