<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:625</H3><P><I>Narrated Humaid:</I></P>
Anas said, "The Prophet said, 'O Bani Salima! Don't you think that for
every step of yours (that you take towards the mosque) there is a 
reward (while coming for prayer)?" Mujahid said: "Regarding Allah's 
Statement: "We record that which they have sent before (them), and 
their traces" (36.12). 'Their traces' means 'their steps.' " And Anas 
said that the people of Bani Salima wanted to shift to a place near 
the Prophet but Allah's Apostle disliked the idea of leaving their 
houses uninhabited and said, "Don't you think that you will get the 
reward for your footprints." Mujahid said, "Their foot prints mean 
their foot steps and their going on foot."
