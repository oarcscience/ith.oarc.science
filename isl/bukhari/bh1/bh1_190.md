*Narrated 'Amr bin Yahya:*

(on the authority of his father) 'Abdullah bin Zaid poured water on his
hands from a utensil containing water and washed them and then with one
handful of water he rinsed his mouth and cleaned his nose by putting

hands over his head, both forwards and backwards, and washed his feet up
to the ankles and said, "This is the ablution of Allah's Apostle."
