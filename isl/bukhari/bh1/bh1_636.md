### Hadith 1:634

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

"When the Prophet became seriously ill and his disease became aggravated
he asked for permission from his wives to be nursed in my house and he
was allowed. He came out with the help of two men and his legs were
dragging on the ground. He was between Al-Abbas and another man."

'Ubaid Ullah said, "I told Ibn 'Abbas what 'Aisha had narrated and he
said, 'Do you know who was the (second) man whose name 'Aisha did not
mention'" I said, 'No.' Ibn 'Abbas said, 'He was 'Ali Ibn Abi Talib.' "
