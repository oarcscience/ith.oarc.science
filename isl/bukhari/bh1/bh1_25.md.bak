### Hadith 1:26

*Narrated Sa'd:*

Allah's Apostle distributed (Zakat) amongst (a group of) people while I
was sitting there but Allah's Apostle left a man whom I thought the best
of the lot. I asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that person?
By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer." The Prophet commented:
"Or merely a Muslim." I remained quiet for a while, but could not help
repeating my question because of what I knew about him. And then asked
Allah's Apostle, "Why have you left so and so? By Allah! He is a
faithful believer." The Prophet again said, "Or merely a Muslim." And I
could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him.
Then the Prophet said, "O Sa'd! I give to a person while another is
dearer to me, for fear that he might be thrown on his face in the Fire
by Allah."
