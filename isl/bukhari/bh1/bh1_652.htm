My father said, "When Allah's Apostle became seriously ill, he was 
told about the prayer. He said, 'Tell Abu Bakr to lead the people in 
the prayer.' 'Aisha said, 'Abu Bakr is a soft-hearted man and he would
be over-powered by his weeping if he recited the Qur'an.' He said to 
them, 'Tell him (Abu Bakr) to lead the prayer. The same reply was 
given to him. He said again, 'Tell him to lead the prayer. You (women)
are the companions of Joseph."
