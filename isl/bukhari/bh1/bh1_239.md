### Hadith 1:239

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "We (Muslims) are the last (people to come in the
world) but (will be) the foremost (on the Day of Resurrection)." The
same narrator told that the Prophet had said, "You should not pass urine
in stagnant water which is not flowing then (you may need to) wash in
it."
