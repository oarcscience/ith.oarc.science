*Narrated Maimuna bint Al-Harith:*

I placed water for the bath of Allah's Apostle and put a screen. He
poured water over his hands, and washed them once or twice. (The
subnarrator added that he did not remember if she had said thrice or
not). Then he poured water with his right hand over his left one and
washed his private parts. He rubbed his hand over the earth or the wall
and washed it. He rinsed his mouth and washed his nose by putting water
in it and blowing it out. He washed his face, forearms and head. He
poured water over his body and then withdrew from that place and washed
his feet. I presented him a piece of cloth (towel) and he pointed with
his hand (that he does not want it) and did not take it.
