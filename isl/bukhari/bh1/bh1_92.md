### Hadith 1:93

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

One day Allah's Apostle came out (before the people) and 'Abdullah bin
Hudhafa stood up and asked (him) "Who is my father?" The Prophet
replied, "Your father is Hudhafa." The Prophet told them repeatedly (in

Prophet and said thrice, "We accept Allah as (our) Lord and Islam as
(our) religion and Muhammad as (our) Prophet." After that the Prophet
