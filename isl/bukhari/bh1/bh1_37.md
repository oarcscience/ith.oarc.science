### Hadith 1:38

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "Religion is very easy and whoever overburdens himself
in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So you should
not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good
tidings that you will be rewarded; and gain strength by worshipping in
the mornings, the nights." (See Fath-ul-Bari, Page 102, Vol 1).

[Next: 1:39: Al-Bara' (bin 'Azib): When the Prophet came to Medina, he
stayed first with his grandfathers...](bh1_38)
