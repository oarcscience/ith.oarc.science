### Hadith 1:805

*Narrated Warrad:*

(the clerk of Al-Mughira bin Shu'ba) Once Al-Mughira dictated to me in a
letter addressed to Mu'awiya that the Prophet used to say after every
compulsory prayer, "La ilaha ilallah wahdahu la sharika lahu,
lahul-mulku wa-lahul-hamdu, wahuwa ala kulli shai in qadir. Allahumma la
mani 'a lima a'taita, wa la mu'tiya lima mana'ta, wa la yanfa'u
dhal-jaddi minka-l-jadd. (None has the right to be worshipped but Allah
and He has no partner in Lordship or in worship or in the Names and the
Qualities, and for Him is the Kingdom and all the praises are for Him
and He is omnipotent. O Allah! Nobody can hold back what you give and
nobody can give what You hold back. Hard (efforts by anyone for anything
cannot benefit one against Your Will)." And Al-Hasan said, "Al-jadd'
means prosperity."
