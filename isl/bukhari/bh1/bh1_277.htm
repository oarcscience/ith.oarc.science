<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:277</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
The Prophet said, 'The (people of) Bani Israel used to take bath naked
(all together) looking at each other. The Prophet Moses used to take a
bath alone. They said, 'By Allah! Nothing prevents Moses from taking a
bath with us except that he has a scrotal hernia.' So once Moses went 
out to take a bath and put his clothes over a stone and then that 
stone ran away with his clothes. Moses followed that stone saying, "My
clothes, O stone! My clothes, O stone! till the people of Bani Israel 
saw him and said, 'By Allah, Moses has got no defect in his body. 
Moses took his clothes and began to beat the stone." Abu Huraira 
added, "By Allah! There are still six or seven marks present on the 
stone from that excessive beating."
<P>
was taking a bath naked, golden locusts began to fall on him. Job 
started collecting them in his clothes. His Lord addressed him, 'O 
Job! Haven't I given you enough so that you are not in need of them.' 
Job replied, 'Yes!' By Your Honor (power)! But I cannot dispense with 
Your Blessings.' "
