### Hadith 1:79

*Narrated Abu Musa:*

The Prophet said, "The example of guidance and knowledge with which
Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of
which was fertile soil that absorbed rain water and brought forth
vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard
and held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they
utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink from it and for
irrigation of the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren
which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that
land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who
comprehends Allah's religion and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which
Allah has revealed through me (the Prophets and learns and then teaches
others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for it
and does not take Allah's guidance revealed through me (He is like that
barren land.)"
