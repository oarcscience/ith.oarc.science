### Hadith 1:389

*Narrated 'Amr bin Dmar:*

I asked Ibn 'Umar, "Can a person who has performed the Tawaf around the
Ka'ba for 'Umra but has not performed the (Sa'i) Tawaf of Safa and
Marwa, have a sexual relation with his wife?" Ibn 'Umar replied "When
the Prophet reached Mecca he performed the Tawaf around the Ka'ba
(circumambulated it seven times) and offered a two-Rak'at prayer (at the
place) behind the station (of Abraham) and then performed the Tawaf
(Sa'i) of Safa and Marwa, and verily in Allah's Apostle you have a good
example." Then we put the same question to Jabir bin 'Abdullah and he
too replied, "He should not go near his wife (for sexual relation) till
he has finished the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa."
