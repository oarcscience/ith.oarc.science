### Hadith 1:794

*Narrated Shaqlq bin Salama:*

'Abdullah said, "Whenever we prayed behind the Prophet we used to recite
(in sitting) 'Peace be on Gabriel, Michael, peace be on so and so. Once
Allah's Apostle looked back at us and said, 'Allah Himself is As-Salam
(Peace), and if anyone of you prays then he should say, At-Tahiyatu
lil-lahi wassalawatu wat-taiyibatu. AsSalamu 'alalika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu wa
rahmatu-l-lahi wa barakatuhu. As-Salam alaina wa ala ibadil-lah
is-salihin. (All the compliments, prayers and good things are due to
Allah: peace be on you, O Prophet and Allah's mercy and blessings be on
you. Peace be on us an on the true pious slaves of Allah). (If you say
that, it will be for all the slaves in the heaven and the earth).
Ash-hadu an la-ilaha illa-l-lahu wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa
Rasuluhu. (I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah
and I also testify that Muhammad is His slave and His Apostle)."
