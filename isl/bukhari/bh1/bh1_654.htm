Allah's Apostle went to establish peace among Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf. In 
the meantime the time of prayer was due and the Mu'adh-dhin went to 
Abu Bakr and said, "Will you lead the prayer, so that I may pronounce 
the Iqama?" Abu Bakr replied in the affirmative and led the prayer. 
Allah's Apostle came while the people were still praying and he 
entered the rows of the praying people till he stood in the (first 
row). The people clapped their hands. Abu Bakr never glanced sideways 
in his prayer but when the people continued clapping, Abu Bakr looked 
and saw Allah's Apostle. Allah's Apostle beckoned him to stay at his 
place. Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Allah for that order of 
Allah's Apostle and then he retreated till he reached the first row. 
Allah's Apostle went forward and led the prayer. When Allah's Apostle 
finished the prayer, he said, "O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from 
staying when I ordered you to do so?"
<P>
Abu Bakr replied, "How can Ibn Abi Quhafa (Abu Bakr) dare to lead the 
prayer in the presence of Allah's Apostle?" Then Allah's Apostle said,
"Why did you clap so much? If something happens to anyone during his 
prayer he should say Subhan Allah. If he says so he will be attended 
to, for clapping is for women."
