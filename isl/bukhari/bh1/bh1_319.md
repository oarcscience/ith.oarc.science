### Hadith 1:319

*Narrated Zainab bint Abi Salama:*

Um-Salama said, "I got my menses while I was lying with the Prophet
under a woolen sheet. So I slipped away, took the clothes for menses and
put them on. Allah's Apostle said, 'Have you got your menses?' I
replied, 'Yes.' Then he called me and took me with him under the woolen
sheet." Um Salama further said, "The Prophet used to kiss me while he
was fasting. The Prophet and I used to take the bath of Janaba from a
single pot."
