'Itban bin Malik used to lead his people (tribe) in prayer and was a 
blind man, he said to Allah's Apostle , "O Allah's Apostle! At times 
it is dark and flood water is flowing (in the valley) and I am blind 
man, so please pray at a place in my house so that I can take it as a 
Musalla (praying place)." So Allah's Apostle went to his house and 
said, "Where do you like me to pray?" 'Itban pointed to a place in his
house and Allah's Apostle, offered the prayer there.
