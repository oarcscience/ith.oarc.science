### Hadith 1:191

*Narrated Amr bin Yahya:*

My father said, "I saw Amr bin Abi Hasan asking 'Abdullah bin Zaid about
the ablution of the Prophet. Abdullah bin Zaid asked for an earthenware
pot containing water and performed ablution in front of them. He poured
water over his hands and washed them thrice. Then he put his (right)
hand in the pot and rinsed his mouth and washed his nose by putting
water in it and then blowing it out thrice with three handfuls of water
Again he put his hand in the water and washed his face thrice. After
that he put his hand in the pot and washed his forearms up to the elbows
twice and then again put his hand in the water and passed wet hands over
his head by bringing them to the front and then to the back and once
more he put his hand in the pot and washed his feet (up to the ankles.)"
