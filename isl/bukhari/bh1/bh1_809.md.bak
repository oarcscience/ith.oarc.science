### Hadith 1:807

*Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:*

The Prophet led us in the Fajr prayer at Hudaibiya after a rainy night.
On completion of the prayer, he faced the people and said, "Do you know
what your Lord has said (revealed)?" The people replied, "Allah and His
Apostle know better." He said, "Allah has said, 'In this morning some of
my slaves remained as true believers and some became non-believers;
whoever said that the rain was due to the Blessings and the Mercy of
Allah had belief in Me and he disbelieves in the stars, and whoever said
that it rained because of a particular star had no belief in Me but
believes in that star.' "
