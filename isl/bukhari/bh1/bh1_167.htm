<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:167</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Ubaid Ibn Juraij:</I></P>
I asked 'Abdullah bin 'Umar, "O Abu 'Abdur-Rahman! I saw you doing 
four things which I never saw being done by anyone of you companions?"
'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "What are those, O Ibn Juraij?" I said, "I 
never saw you touching any corner of the Ka'ba except these (two) 
facing south (Yemen) and I saw you wearing shoes made of tanned 
leather and dyeing your hair with Hinna; (a kind of dye). I also 
noticed that whenever you were in Mecca, the people assume l,hram on 
seeing the new moon crescent (1st of Dhul-Hijja) while you did not 
assume the Ihlal (Ihram)--(Ihram is also called Ihlal which means 
'Loud calling' because a Muhrim has to recite Talbiya aloud when 
assuming the state of Ihram)--till the 8th of Dhul-Hijja (Day of 
Tarwiya). 'Abdullah replied, "Regarding the corners of Ka'ba, I never 
saw Allah's Apostle touching except those facing south (Yemen) and 
regarding the tanned leather shoes, no doubt I saw Allah's Apostle 
wearing non-hairy shoes and he used to perform ablution while wearing 
the shoes (i.e. wash his feet and then put on the shoes). So I love to
wear similar shoes. And about the dyeing of hair with Hinna; no doubt 
I saw Allah's Apostle dyeing his hair with it and that is why I like 
to dye (my hair with it). Regarding Ihlal, I did not see Allah's 
Apostle assuming Ihlal till he set out for Hajj (on the 8th of 
Dhul-Hijja)."
