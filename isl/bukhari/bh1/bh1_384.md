*Narrated Ibrahim:*

Hammam bin Al-Harith said, "I saw Jarir bin 'Abdullah urinating. Then he
performed ablution and passed his (wet) hands over his Khuffs, stood up
and prayed. He was asked about it. He replied that he had seen the
Prophet doing the same." They approved of this narration as Jarir was

ablution and he passed his wet ...](bh1_385)
