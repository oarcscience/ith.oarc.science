### Hadith 1:791

*Narrated Muhammad bin 'Amr bin 'Ata':*

I was sitting with some of the companions of Allah's Apostle and we were
discussing about the way of praying of the Prophet. Abu Humaid As-Saidi
said, "I remember the prayer of Allah's Apostle better than any one of
you. I saw him raising both his hands up to the level of the shoulders
on saying the Takbir; and on bowing he placed his hands on both knees
and bent his back straight, then he stood up straight from bowing till
all the vertebrate took their normal positions. In prostrations, he
placed both his hands on the ground with the forearms away from the
ground and away from his body, and his toes were facing the Qibla. On
sitting In the second Rak'a he sat on his left foot and propped up the
right one; and in the last Rak'a he pushed his left foot forward and
kept the other foot propped up and sat over the buttocks "
