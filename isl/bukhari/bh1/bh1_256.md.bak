### Hadith 1:256

*Narrated Abu Ja'far:*

Jabir bin Abdullah said to me, "Your cousin (Hasan bin Muhammad bin
Al-Hanafiya) came to me and asked about the bath of Janaba. I replied,
'The Prophet uses to take three handfuls of water, pour them on his head
and then pour more water over his body.' Al-Hasan said to me, 'I am a
hairy man.' I replied, 'The Prophet had more hair than you'. "

[Next: 1:257: Maimuna: I placed water for the bath of the Prophet. He
washed his hands twice ...](bh1_257.md)
