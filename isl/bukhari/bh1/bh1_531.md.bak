### Hadith 1:529

*Narrated Qais:*

Jarir said, "We were with the Prophet and he looked at the
moon--full-moon--and said, 'Certainly you will see your Lord as you see
this moon and you will have no trouble in seeing Him. So if you can
avoid missing (through sleep or business, etc.) a prayer before the
sun-rise (Fajr) and a prayer before sunset ('Asr), you must do so.' He
then recited Allah's Statement:

And celebrate the praises Of your Lord before The rising of the sun And
before (its) setting." (50.39) Isma'il said, "Offer those prayers and do
not miss them."
