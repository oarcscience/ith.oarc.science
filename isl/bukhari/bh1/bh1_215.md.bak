### Hadith 1:215

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

Once the Prophet, while passing through one of the grave-yards of Medina
or Mecca heard the voices of two persons who were being tortured in
their graves. The Prophet said, "These two persons are being tortured
not for a major sin (to avoid)." The Prophet then added, "Yes! (they are
being tortured for a major sin). Indeed, one of them never saved himself
from being soiled with his urine while the other used to go about with
calumnies (to make enmiy between friends). The Prophet then asked for a
green leaf of a date-palm tree, broke it into two pieces and put one on
each grave. On being asked why he had done so, he replied, "I hope that
their torture might be lessened, till these get dried."
