### Hadith 1:666

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

One night I slept at the house of (my aunt) Maimuna and the Prophet was
there on that night. He performed ablution and stood up for the prayer.
I joined him and stood on his left side but he drew me to his right and
prayed thirteen Rakat and then slept till I heard his breath sounds. And
whenever he slept, he used to breathe with audible sounds. The
Mu'adhdhin came to the Prophet and he went out and prayed the morning
prayer) without repeating the ablution.
