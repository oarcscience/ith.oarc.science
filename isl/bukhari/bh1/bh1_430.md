### Hadith 1:429

*Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah:*

Allah's Apostle said, "I have been given five things which were not
given to any amongst the Prophets before me. These are:

1\. Allah made me victorious by awe (by His frightening my enemies) for
a distance of one month's journey.

2\. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for
praying and a thing to perform Tayammum. Therefore my followers can pray
wherever the time of a prayer is due.

3\. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me (and was not made so
for anyone else).

4\. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation exclusively but I have
been sent 1o all mankind.

5\. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of
Resurrection.)
