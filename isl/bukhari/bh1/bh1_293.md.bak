### Hadith 1:293

*Narrated Al-Qasim:*

'Aisha said, "We set out with the sole intention of performing Hajj and
when we reached Sarif, (a place six miles from Mecca) I got my menses.
Allah's Apostle came to me while I was weeping. He said 'What is the
matter with you? Have you got your menses?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said,
'This is a thing which Allah has ordained for the daughters of Adam. So

(Circumambulation) round the Ka'ba." 'Aisha added, "Allah's Apostle
sacrificed cows on behalf of his wives."
