### Hadith 1:98

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

I said: "O Allah's Apostle! Who will be the luckiest person, who will
gain your intercession on the Day of Resurrection?" Allah's Apostle
said: O Abu Huraira! "I have thought that none will ask me about it
before you as I know your longing for the (learning of) Hadiths. The
luckiest person who will have my intercession on the Day of Resurrection
will be the one who said sincerely from the bottom of his heart "None
has the right to be worshipped but Allah."

And 'Umar bin 'Abdul 'Aziz wrote to Abu Bakr bin Hazm, "Look for the
knowledge of Hadith and get it written, as I am afraid that religious
knowledge will vanish and the religious learned men will pass away
(die). Do not accept anything save the Hadiths of the Prophet. Circulate
knowledge and teach the ignorant, for knowledge does not vanish except
when it is kept secretly (to oneself)."
