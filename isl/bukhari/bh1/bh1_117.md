### Hadith 1:117

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

I stayed overnight in the house of my aunt Maimuna bint Al-Harith (the
wife of the Prophet ) while the Prophet was there with her during her
night turn. The Prophet offered the 'Isha' prayer (in the mosque),
returned home and after having prayed four Rakat, he slept. Later on he
got up at night and then asked whether the boy (or he used a similar
word) had slept? Then he got up for the prayer and I stood up by his
left side but he made me stand to his right and offered five Rakat
followed by two more Rakat. Then he slept and I heard him snoring and
then (after a while) he left for the (Fajr) prayer.
