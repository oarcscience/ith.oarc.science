### Hadith 1:801

*Narrated Mahmud bin Ar-Rabi':*

I remember Allah's Apostle and also the mouthful of water which he took
from a bucket in our house and ejected (on me). I heard from ltban bin
Malik Al-Ansari, who was one from Bani Salim, saying, "I used to lead my
tribe of Bani Salim in prayer. Once I went to the Prophet and said to
him, 'I have weak eye-sight and at times the rainwater flood intervenes
between me and the mosque of my tribe and I wish that you would come to
my house and pray at some place so that I could take that place as a
place for praying (mosque). He said, "Allah willing, I shall do that."
Next day Allah's Apostle along with Abu Bakr, came to my house after the
sun had risen high and he asked permission to enter. I gave him
permission, but he didn't sit till he said to me, "Where do you want me
to pray in your house?" I pointed to a place in the house where I wanted
him to pray. So he stood up for the prayer and we aligned behind him. He
completed the prayer with Taslim and we did the same simultaneously."
