### Hadith 1:503

*Narrated Shaqiq:*

that he had heard Hudhaifa saying, "Once I was sitting with 'Umar and he
said, 'Who amongst you remembers the statement of Allah's Apostle about
the afflictions?' I said, 'I know it as the Prophet had said it.' 'Umar
said, 'No doubt you are bold.' I said, 'The afflictions caused for a man
by his wife, money, children and neighbor are expiated by his prayers,
fasting, charity and by enjoining (what is good) and forbidding (what is
evil).' 'Umar said, 'I did not mean that but I asked about that
affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea.' I (Hudhaifa)
said, 'O leader of the faithful believers! You need not be afraid of it
as there is a closed door between you and it.' 'Umar asked, Will the
door be broken or opened?' I replied, 'It will be broken.' 'Umar said,
'Then it will never be closed again.' I was asked whether 'Umar knew
that door. I replied that he knew it as one knows that there will be
night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated a Hadith that was free
from any mis-statement" The subnarrator added that they deputed Masruq
to ask Hudhaifa (about the door). Hudhaifa said, "The door was 'Umar
himself."
