### Hadith 1:541

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

Allah's Apostle once delayed the 'Isha' prayer and that was during the
days when Islam still had not spread. The Prophet did not come out till
'Umar informed him that the women and children had slept. Then he came
out and said to the people of the mosque:"None amongst the dwellers of
the earth has been waiting for it ('Isha prayer) except you."

I landed at a place ...](bh1_544)
