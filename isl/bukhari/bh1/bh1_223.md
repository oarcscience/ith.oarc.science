### Hadith 1:223

*Narrated Um Qais bint Mihsin:*

I brought my young son, who had not started eating (ordinary food) to
Allah's Apostle who took him and made him sit in his lap. The child
urinated on the garment of the Prophet, so he asked for water and poured
it over the soiled (area) and did not wash it.

[Next: 1:224: Hudhaifa: Once the Prophet went to the dumps of some
people and passed urine ...](bh1_224)
