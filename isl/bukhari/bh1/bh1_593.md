### Hadith 1:591

*Narrated Salim bin Abdullah:*

My father said that Allah s Apostle said, "Bilal pronounces 'Adhan at
night, so keep on eating and drinking (Suhur) till Ibn Um Maktum
pronounces Adhan." Salim added, "He was a blind man who would not
pronounce the Adhan unless he was told that the day had dawned."

prayer and the dawn ...](bh1_594.md)
