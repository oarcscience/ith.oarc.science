### Hadith 1:309

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

None of us had more than a single garment and we used to have our menses
while wearing it. Whenever it got soiled with blood of menses we used to
apply saliva to the blood spot and rub off the blood with our nails.

[Next: 1:310: Um-'Atiya: We were forbidden to mourn for a dead person
for more than three days ...](bh1_310.md)
