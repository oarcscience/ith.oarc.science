<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:485</H3><P><I>Narrated Nafi:</I></P>
"The Prophet used to make his she-camel sit across and he would pray 
facing it (as a Sutra)." I asked, "What would the Prophet do if the 
she-camel was provoked and moved?" He said, "He would take its 
camel-saddle and put it in front of him and pray facing its back part 
(as a Sutra). And Ibn 'Umar used to do the same." (This indicates that
one should not pray except behind a Sutra).
