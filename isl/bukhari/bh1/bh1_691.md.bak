### Hadith 1:689

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, "The Imam is (appointed) to be followed. So do not
differ from him, bow when he bows, and say, "Rabbana-lakal hamd" if he
says "Sami'a-l-lahu Liman hamida"; and if he prostrates, prostrate

straighten the rows for the prayer, as the straightening of the rows is
amongst those things which make your prayer a correct and perfect one.
