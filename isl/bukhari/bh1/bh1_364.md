### Hadith 1:364

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet forbade two kinds of sales i.e. Al-Limais and An-Nibadh (the
former is a kind of sale in which the deal is completed if the buyer
touches a thing, without seeing or checking it properly and the latter
is a kind of a sale in which the deal is completed when the seller
throws a thing towards the buyer giving him no opportunity to see, touch
or check it) and (the Prophet forbade) also Ishtimal-As-Samma' and
Al-Ihtiba' in a single garment.
