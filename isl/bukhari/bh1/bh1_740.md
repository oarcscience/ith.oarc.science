### Hadith 1:738

*Narrated Saiyar bin Salama:*

My father and I went to Abu Barza-al-Aslami to ask him about the stated
times for the prayers. He replied, "The Prophet used to offer the Zuhr
prayer when the sun just declined from its highest position at noon; the
'Asr at a time when if a man went to the farthest place in Medina (after
praying) he would find the sun still hot (bright). (The sub narrator
said: I have forgotten what Abu Barza said about the Maghrib prayer).
The Prophet never found any harm in delaying the 'Isha' prayer to the
first third of the night and he never liked to sleep before it and to
talk after it. He used to offer the morning prayer at a time when after
finishing it one could recognize the person sitting beside him and used
to recite between 60 to 100 verses in one or both the Rakat."
