### Hadith 1:682

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Once Allah's Apostle prayed two Rakat (instead of four) and finished his
prayer. Dhu-l-yadain asked him whether the prayer had been reduced or
whether he had forgotten. Allah's Apostle asked the people whether
Dhu-l-yadain was telling the truth. The people replied in the
affirmative. Then Allah's Apostle stood up, offered the remaining two
Rakat and then finished his prayer with Taslim and then said, "Allahu
Akbar." He followed it with two prostrations like ordinary prostrations
or a bit longer.
