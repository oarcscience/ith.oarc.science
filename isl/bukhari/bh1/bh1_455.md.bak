### Hadith 1:453

*Narrated Um Salama:*

I complained to Allah's Apostle that I was sick. He told me to perform
the Tawaf behind the people while riding. So I did so and Allah's
Apostle was praying beside the Ka'ba and reciting the Sura starting with
"Wat-tur-wa-Kitabinmastur."

[Next: 1:454: Anas bin Malik: Two of the companions of the Prophet
departed from him on a dark night...](bh1_456.md)
