### Hadith 1:484

*Narrated Nafi':*

'Abdullah bin 'Umar said, "Allah's Apostle entered the Ka'ba along with
Usama bin Zaid, Bilal and 'Uthman bin Talha Al-Hajabi and closed the
door and stayed there for some time. I asked Bilal when he came out,
'What did the Prophet do?' He replied, 'He offered prayer with one
pillar to his left and one to his right and three behind.' In those days
the Ka'ba was supported by six pillars." Malik said: "There were two
pillars on his (the Prophet's) right side."
