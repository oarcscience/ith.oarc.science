(on the authority of his father) 'Aisha said, "Whenever Allah's 
Apostle took the bath of Janaba, he cleaned his hands and performed 
ablution like that for prayer and then took a bath and rubbed his 
hair, till he felt that the whole skin of the head had become wet, 
then he would pour water thrice and wash the rest of the body." 'Aisha
further said, "I and Allah's Apostle used to take a bath from a single
water container, from which we took water simultaneously."
