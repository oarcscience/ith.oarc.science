Whenever Allah's Apostle came out on 'Id day, he used to order that a 
Harba (a short spear) to be planted in front of him (as a Sutra for 
his prayer) and then he used to pray facing it with the people behind 
him and used to do the same while on a journey. After the Prophet , 
this practice was adopted by the Muslim rulers (who followed his 
traditions).
