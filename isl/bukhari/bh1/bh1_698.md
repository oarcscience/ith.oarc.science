### Hadith 1:696

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

Allah's Apostle used to pray in his room at night. As the wall of the
room was LOW, the people saw him and some of them stood up to follow him
in the prayer. In the morning they spread the news. The following night
the Prophet stood for the prayer and the people followed him. This went
on for two or three nights. Thereupon Allah's Apostle did not stand for
the prayer the following night, and did not come out. In the morning,
the people asked him about it. He replied, that he way afraid that the
night prayer might become compulsory.
