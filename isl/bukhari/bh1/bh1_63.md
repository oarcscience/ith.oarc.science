### Hadith 1:64

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abbas:*

Once Allah's Apostle gave a letter to a person and ordered him to go and
deliver it to the Governor of Bahrain. (He did so) and the Governor of
Bahrain sent it to Chousroes, who read that letter and then tore it to
pieces. (The sub-narrator (Ibn Shihab) thinks that Ibn Al-Musaiyab said
that Allah's Apostle invoked Allah against them (saying), "May Allah
tear them into pieces, and disperse them all totally.)"
