<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:127</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Abdullah:</I></P>
While I was going with the Prophet through the ruins of Medina and he 
was reclining on a date-palm leaf stalk, some Jews passed by. Some of 
them said to the others: Ask him (the Prophet) about the spirit. Some 
of them said that they should not ask him that question as he might 
give a reply which would displease them. But some of them insisted on 
asking, and so one of them stood up and asked, "O Aba-l-Qasim ! What 
is the spirit?" The Prophet remained quiet. I thought he was being 
inspired Divinely. So I stayed till that state of the Prophet (while 
being inspired) was over. The Prophet then said, "And they ask you (O 
Muhammad) concerning the spirit --Say: The spirit -- its knowledge is 
with my Lord. And of knowledge you (mankind) have been given only a 
little)." (17.85)
