The Prophet led us in prayer and then went up to the pulpit and 
beckoned with both hands towards the Qibla of the mosque and then 
said, "When I started leading you in prayer, I saw the display of 
Paradise and Hell on the wall of the mosque (facing the Qibla). I 
never saw good and bad as I have seen today." He repeated the last 
statement thrice.
