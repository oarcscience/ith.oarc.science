### Hadith 1:318

*Narrated Mu'adha:*

A woman asked 'Aisha, "Should I offer the prayers that which I did not
offer because of menses" 'Aisha said, "Are you from the Huraura' (a town
in Iraq?) We were with the Prophet and used to get our periods but he
never ordered us to offer them (the Prayers missed during menses)."
'Aisha perhaps said, "We did not offer them."

while I was lying with the Prophet ...](bh1_319.md)
