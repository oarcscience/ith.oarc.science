### Hadith 1:176

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

Allah's Apostle said, "A person is considered in prayer as long as he is
waiting for the prayer in the mosque as long as he does not do Hadath."
A non-Arab man asked, "O Abii Huraira! What is Hadath?" I replied, "It
is the passing of wind (from the anus) (that is one of the types of
Hadath)."

should not leave his prayer ...](bh1_177.md)
