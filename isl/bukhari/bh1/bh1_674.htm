<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:672</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Mas'ud:</I></P>
A man came and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I keep away from the morning 
prayer because so-and-so (Imam) prolongs it too much." Allah's Apostle
became furious and I had never seen him more furious than he was on 
that day. The Prophet said, "O people! Some of you make others dislike
the prayer, so whoever becomes an Imam he should shorten the prayer, 
as behind him are the weak, the old and the needy.''
