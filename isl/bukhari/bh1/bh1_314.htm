<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:314</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Aisha:</I></P>
On the 1st of Dhul-Hijja we set out with the intention of performing 
Hajj. Allah's Apostle said, "Any one who likes to assume the Ihram for
'Umra he can do so. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have 
assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. "Some of us assumed the Ihram for 'Umra 
while the others assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I was one of those who 
assumed the Ihram for 'Umra. I got menses and kept on menstruating 
until the day of 'Arafat and complained of that to the Prophet . He 
told me to postpone my 'Umra, undo and comb my hair, and to assure the
Ihram of Hajj and I did so. On the right of Hasba, he sent my brother 
'Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr with me to At-Tah'im, where I assumed the 
Ihram for'Umra in lieu of the previous one. Hisham said, "For that 
('Umra) no Hadi, fasting or alms were required.
