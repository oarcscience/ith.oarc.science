### Hadith 1:277

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

The Prophet said, 'The (people of) Bani Israel used to take bath naked
(all together) looking at each other. The Prophet Moses used to take a
bath alone. They said, 'By Allah! Nothing prevents Moses from taking a
bath with us except that he has a scrotal hernia.' So once Moses went
out to take a bath and put his clothes over a stone and then that stone
ran away with his clothes. Moses followed that stone saying, "My
clothes, O stone! My clothes, O stone! till the people of Bani Israel
saw him and said, 'By Allah, Moses has got no defect in his body. Moses
took his clothes and began to beat the stone." Abu Huraira added, "By
Allah! There are still six or seven marks present on the stone from that
excessive beating."

was taking a bath naked, golden locusts began to fall on him. Job
started collecting them in his clothes. His Lord addressed him, 'O Job!
Haven't I given you enough so that you are not in need of them.' Job
replied, 'Yes!' By Your Honor (power)! But I cannot dispense with Your
Blessings.' "
