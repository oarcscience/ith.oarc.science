### Hadith 1:301

*Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:*

Once Allah's Apostle went out to the Musalla (to offer the prayer) o
'Id-al-Adha or Al-Fitr prayer. Then he passed by the women and said, "O
women! Give alms, as I have seen that the majority of the dwellers of
Hell-fire were you (women)." They asked, "Why is it so, O Allah's
Apostle ?" He replied, "You curse frequently and are ungrateful to your
husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and
religion than you. A cautious sensible man could be led astray by some
of you." The women asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What is deficient in our
intelligence and religion?" He said, "Is not the evidence of two women
equal to the witness of one man?" They replied in the affirmative. He
said, "This is the deficiency in her intelligence. Isn't it true that a
woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?" The women replied in
the affirmative. He said, "This is the deficiency in her religion."
