The Prophet used to pray the Zuhr at mid-day, and the 'Asr at a time 
when the sun was still bright, the Maghrib after sunset (at its stated

assembled (for Isha' prayer) he would pray earlier and if the people 
delayed, he would delay the prayer. And they or the Prophet used to 
offer the Fajr Prayers when it still dark.
