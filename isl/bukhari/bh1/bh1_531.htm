Jarir said, "We were with the Prophet and he looked at the 
moon--full-moon--and said, 'Certainly you will see your Lord as you 
see this moon and you will have no trouble in seeing Him. So if you 
can avoid missing (through sleep or business, etc.) a prayer before 
the sun-rise (Fajr) and a prayer before sunset ('Asr), you must do 
so.' He then recited Allah's Statement:
<P>
And celebrate the praises Of your Lord before The rising of the sun 
And before (its) setting." (50.39) Isma'il said, "Offer those prayers 
and do not miss them."
