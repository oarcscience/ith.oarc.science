<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:194</H3><P><I>Narrated Anas:</I></P>
It was the time for prayer, and those whose houses were near got up 
and went to their people (to perform ablution), and there remained 
some people (sitting). Then a painted stove pot (Mikhdab) containing 
water was brought to Allah's Apostles The pot was small, not broad 
enough for one to spread one's hand in; yet all the people performed 
ablution. (The sub narrator said, "We asked Anas, 'How many persons 
were you?' Anas replied 'We were eighty or more"). (It was one of the 
miracles of Allah's Apostle).
