### Hadith 1:463

*Narrated Abu Waqid al-Laithi:*

While Allah's Apostle was sitting in the mosque (with some people) three
men came, two of them came in front of Allah's Apostle and the third one
went away, and then one of them found a place in the circle and sat
there while the second man sat behind the gathering, and the third one
went away. When Allah's Apostle finished his preaching, he said, "Shall
I tell you about these three persons? One of them betook himself to
Allah and so Allah accepted him and accommodated him; the second felt
shy before Allah so Allah did the same for him and sheltered him in His
Mercy (and did not punish him), while the third turned his face from
Allah, and went away, so Allah turned His face from him likewise.

Apostle lying flat (on his back) ...](bh1_466.md)
