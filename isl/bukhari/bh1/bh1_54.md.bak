### Hadith 1:55

*Narrated Ziyad bin'Ilaqa:*

I heard Jarir bin 'Abdullah (Praising Allah). On the day when Al-Mughira
bin Shu'ba died, he (Jarir) got up (on the pulpit) and thanked and
praised Allah and said, "Be afraid of Allah alone Who has none along
with Him to be worshipped.(You should) be calm and quiet till the (new)
chief comes to you and he will come to you soon. Ask Allah's forgiveness
for your (late) chief because he himself loved to forgive others." Jarir
added, "Amma badu (now then), I went to the Prophet and said, 'I give my
pledge of allegiance to you for Islam." The Prophet conditioned (my
pledge) for me to be sincere and true to every Muslim so I gave my
pledge to him for this. By the Lord of this mosque! I am sincere and
true to you (Muslims). Then Jarir asked for Allah's forgiveness and came
down (from the pulpit).
