'Abdullah bin Mas'ud said, "While Allah's Apostle was praying beside 
the Ka'ba, there were some Quraish people sitting in a gathering. One 
of them said, 'Don't you see this (who does deeds just to show off)? 
Who amongst you can go and bring the dung, blood and the abdominal 
contents (intestines, etc). of the slaughtered camels of the family of
so and so and then wait till he prostrates and put that in between his
shoulders?' The most unfortunate amongst them ('Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait) 
went (and brought them) and when Allah's Apostle prostrated, he put 
them between his shoulders. The Prophet remained in prostration and 
they laughed so much so that they fell on each other. A passerby went 
to Fatima, who was a young girl in those days. She came running and 
the Prophet was still in prostration. She removed them and cursed upon
the Quraish on their faces. When Allah's Apostle completed his prayer,
he said, 'O Allah! Take revenge on Quraish.' He said so thrice and 
added, 'O Allah! take revenge on 'Amr bin Hisham, 'Utba bin Rabia, 
Shaiba bin Rabi'a, Al-Walid bin'Utba, Umaiya bin Khalaf, 'Uqba bin Abi
Mu'ait and 'Umar a bin Al-Walid." Abdullah added, "By Allah! I saw all
of them dead in the battle field on the day of Badr and they were 
dragged and thrown in the Qalib (a well) at Badr: Allah's Apostle then
said, 'Allah's curse has descended upon the people of the Qalib 
(well).
