<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:179</H3><P><I>Narrated Zaid bin Khalid:</I></P>
I asked 'Uthman bin 'Affan about a person who engaged in intercourse 
but did no discharge. 'Uthman replied, "He should perform ablution 
like the one for ar ordinary prayer but he must wash his penis." 
'Uthman added, "I heard it from Allah's Apostle." I asked 'Ali 
Az-Zubair, Talha and Ubai bin Ka'b about it and they, too, gave the 
same reply. (This order was cancelled later on and taking a bath 
became necessary for such cases).
