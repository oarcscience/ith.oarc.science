### Hadith 1:373

*Narrated Abu Juhaifa:*

I saw Allah's Apostle in a red leather tent and I saw Bilal taking the
remaining water with which the Prophet had performed ablution. I saw the
people taking the utilized water impatiently and whoever got some of it
rubbed it on his body and those who could not get any took the moisture
from the others' hands. Then I saw Bilal carrying an 'Anza (a
spear-headed stick) which he planted in the ground. The Prophet came out
tucking up his red cloak, and led the people in prayer and offered two
Rakat (facing the Ka'ba) taking 'Anza as a Sutra for his prayer. I saw
the people and animals passing in front of him beyond the 'Anza.
