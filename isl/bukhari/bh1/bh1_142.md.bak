### Hadith 1:142

*Narrated 'Ata' bin Yasar:*

Ibn 'Abbas performed ablution and washed his face (in the following
way): He ladled out a handful of water, rinsed his mouth and washed his
nose with it by putting in water and then blowing it out. He then, took
another handful (of water) and did like this (gesturing) joining both
hands, and washed his face, took another handful of water and washed his
right forearm. He again took another handful of water and washed his
left forearm, and passed wet hands over his head and took another
handful of water and poured it over his right foot (up to his ankles)
and washed it thoroughly and similarly took another handful of water and
washed thoroughly his left foot (up to the ankles) and said, "I saw
Allah's Apostle performing ablution in this way."
