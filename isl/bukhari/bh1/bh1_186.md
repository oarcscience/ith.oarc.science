### Hadith 1:186

*Narrated 'Amr:*

My father saw 'Amr bin Abi Hasan asking 'Abdullah bin Zaid about the
ablution of the Prophet. 'Abdullah bin Zaid asked for earthen-ware pot
containing water and in front of them performed ablution like that of
the Prophet . He poured water from the pot over his hand and washed his
hands thrice and then he put his hands in the pot and rinsed his mouth
and washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it out with
three handfuls of water. Again he put his hand in the water and washed
his face thrice and washed his forearms up to the elbows twice; and then
put his hands in the water and then passed them over his head by
bringing them to the front and then to the rear of the head once, and
then he washed his feet up to the ankles.

for ablution was brought ...](bh1_187)
