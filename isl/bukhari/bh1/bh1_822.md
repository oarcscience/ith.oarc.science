### Hadith 1:820

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

Once I came riding a she-ass and I, then, had just attained the age of
puberty. Allah's Apostle was leading the people in prayer at Mina facing
no wall. I passed in front of the row and let loose the she-ass for
grazing and joined the row and no one objected to my deed.

till 'Umar informed him...](bh1_823.md)
