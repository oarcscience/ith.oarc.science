### Hadith 1:28

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

The Prophet said: "I was shown the Hell-fire and that the majority of
its dwellers were women who were ungrateful." It was asked, "Do they
disbelieve in Allah?" (or are they ungrateful to Allah?) He replied,
"They are ungrateful to their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors
and the good (charitable deeds) done to them. If you have always been
good (benevolent) to one of them and then she sees something in you (not
of her liking), she will say, 'I have never received any good from you."
