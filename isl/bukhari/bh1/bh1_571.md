### Hadith 1:569

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Abi Qatada:*

My father said, "One night we were traveling with the Prophet and some
people said, 'We wish that Allah's Apostle would take a rest along with
us during the last hours of the night.' He said, 'I am afraid that you
will sleep and miss the (Fajr) prayer.' Bilal said, 'I will make you get
up.' So all slept and Bilal rested his back against his Rahila and he
too was overwhelmed (by sleep) and slept. The Prophet got up when the
edge of the sun had risen and said, 'O Bilal! What about your
statement?' He replied, 'I have never slept such a sleep.' The Prophet
said, 'Allah captured your souls when He wished, and released them when
He wished. O Bilal! Get up and pronounce the Adhan for the prayer.' The
Prophet performed ablution and when the sun came up and became bright,
he stood up and prayed."
