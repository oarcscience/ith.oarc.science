### Hadith 1:598

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

"When the Mu'adhdhin pronounced the Adhan, some of the companions of the
Prophet would proceed to the pillars of the mosque (for the prayer) till
the Prophet arrived and in this way they used to pray two Rakat before
the Maghrib prayer. There used to be a little time between the Adhan and
the Iqama." Shu'ba said, "There used to be a very short interval between
the two (Adhan and Iqama)."

before the morning ...](bh1_601)
