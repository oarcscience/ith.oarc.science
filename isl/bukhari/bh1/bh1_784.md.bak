### Hadith 1:782

*Narrated Abu Qilaba:*

Once Malik bin Huwairith said to his friends, "Shall I show you how
Allah's Apostle used to offer his prayers?" And it was not the time for
any of the compulsory congregational prayers. So he stood up (for the
prayer) bowed and said the Takbir, then he raised his head and remained
standing for a while and then prostrated and raised his head for a while
(sat up for a while). He prayed like our Sheikh 'Amr Ibn Salama. (Aiyub
said, "The latter used to do a thing which I did not see the people
doing i.e. he used to sit between the third and the fourth Rak'a).
IMalik bin Huwairith said, "We came to the Prophet (after embracing
Islam) and stayed with him. He said to us, 'When you go back to your
families, pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, pray such
and such a prayer at such and such a time, and when there is the time
for the prayer then only of you should pronounce the Adhan for the
prayer and the oldest of you should lead the prayer."
