Fatima bint Abi Hubaish came to the Prophet and said, "O Allah's 
Apostle I get persistent bleeding from the uterus and do not become 
clean. Shall I give up my prayers?" Allah's Apostle replied, "No, 
because it is from a blood vessel and not the menses. So when your 
real menses begins give up your prayers and when it has finished wash 
off the blood (take a bath) and offer your prayers." Hisham (the sub 
narrator) narrated that his father had also said, (the Prophet told 
her): "Perform ablution for every prayer till the time of the next 
period comes."
