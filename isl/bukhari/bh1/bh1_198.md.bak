*Narrated 'Amr bin Yahya:*

(on the authority of his father) My uncle used to perform ablution
extravagantly and once he asked 'Abdullah bin Zaid to tell him how he
had seen the Prophet performing ablution. He asked for an earthen-ware
pot containing water, and poured water from it on his hands and washed
them thrice, and then put his hand in the earthen-ware pot and rinsed
his mouth and washed his nose by putting water in it and then blowing it
Out thrice with one handful of water; he again put his hand in the water
and took a handful of water and washed his face thrice, then washed his
hands up to the elbows twice, and took water with his hand, and passed
it over his head from front to back and then from back to front, and
then washed his feet (up to the ankles) and said, "I saw the Prophet
performing ablution in that way."
