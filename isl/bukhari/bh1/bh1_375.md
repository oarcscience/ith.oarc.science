### Hadith 1:375

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Once Allah's Apostle fell off a horse and his leg or shoulder got
injured. He swore that he would not go to his wives for one month and he
stayed in a Mashruba (attic room) having stairs made of date palm
trunks. So his companions came to visit him, and he led them in prayer
sitting, whereas his companions were standing. When he finished the
prayer, he said, "Imam is meant to be followed, so when he says 'Allahu
Akbar,' say 'Allahu Akbar' and when he bows, bow and when he prostrates,
prostrate and if he prays standing pray, standing. After the 29th day
the Prophet came down (from the attic room) and the people asked him, "O
Allah's Apostle! You swore that you will not go to your wives for one
month." He said, "The month is 29 days."
