<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:86</H3><P><I>Narrated Asma:</I></P>
I came to 'Aisha while she was praying, and said to her, "What has 
happened to the people?" She pointed out towards the sky. (I looked 
towards the mosque), and saw the people offering the prayer. Aisha 
said, "Subhan Allah." I said to her, "Is there a sign?" She nodded 
with her head meaning, "Yes." I, too, then stood (for the prayer of 
eclipse) till I became (nearly) unconscious and later on I poured 
water on my head. After the prayer, the Prophet praised and glorified 
Allah and then said,
<P>
"Just now at this place I have seen what I have never seen before, 
including Paradise and Hell. No doubt it has been inspired to me that 
you will be put to trials in your graves and these trials will be like
the trials of Masiah-ad-Dajjal or nearly like it (the sub narrator is 
not sure which expression Asma' used). You will be asked, 'What do you
know about this man (the Prophet Muhammad)?' Then the faithful 
believer (or Asma' said a similar word) will reply, 'He is Muhammad 
Allah's Apostle who had come to us with clear evidences and guidance 
and so we accepted his teachings and followed him. And he is 
Muhammad.' And he will repeat it thrice. Then the angels will say to 
him, 'Sleep in peace as we have come to know that you were a faithful 
believer.' On the other hand, a hypocrite or a doubtful person will 
reply, 'I do not know, but I heard the people saying something and so 
I said it.' (the same). "
