### Hadith 1:506

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "If there was a river at the door of
anyone of you and he took a bath in it five times a day would you notice
any dirt on him?" They said, "Not a trace of dirt would be left." The
Prophet added, "That is the example of the five prayers with which Allah
blots out (annuls) evil deeds."

they were (practiced)...](bh1_509.md)
