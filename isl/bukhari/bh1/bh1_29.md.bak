*Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais:*

While I was going to help this man ('Ali Ibn Abi Talib), Abu Bakra met

person." He said, "Go back for I have heard Allah's Apostle saying,
'When two Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the

Allah's Apostle! It is all right for the murderer but what about the
murdered one?' Allah's Apostle replied, "He surely had the intention to
kill his companion."
