### Hadith 1:118

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

People say that I have narrated many Hadiths (The Prophet's narrations).
Had it not been for two verses in the Qur'an, I would not have narrated
a single Hadith, and the verses are:

"Verily those who conceal the clear sign and the guidance which We have
sent down . . . (up to) Most Merciful." (2:159-160). And no doubt our
Muhajir (emigrant) brothers used to be busy in the market with their
business (bargains) and our Ansari brothers used to be busy with their
property (agriculture). But I (Abu Huraira) used to stick to Allah's
Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach and I used to attend
that which they used not to attend and I used to memorize that which
they used not to memorize.

narrations (Hadiths) from you ...](bh1_119)
