### Hadith 1:41

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

Once the Prophet came while a woman was sitting with me. He said, "Who
is she?" I replied, "She is so and so," and told him about her
(excessive) praying. He said disapprovingly, "Do (good) deeds which is
within your capacity (without being overtaxed) as Allah does not get
tired (of giving rewards) but (surely) you will get tired and the best
deed (act of Worship) in the sight of Allah is that which is done
regularly."

[Next: 1:42: Anas: The Prophet said, Whoever said None has the right to
be worshipped ...](bh1_41)
