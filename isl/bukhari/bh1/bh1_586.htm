<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:584</H3><P><I>Narrated Humaid:</I></P>
Anas bin Malik said, "Whenever the Prophet went out with us to fight 
(in Allah's cause) against any nation, he never allowed us to attack 
till morning and he would wait and see: if he heard Adhan he would 
postpone the attack and if he did not hear Adhan he would attack 
them." Anas added, "We reached Khaibar at night and in the morning 
when he did not hear the Adhan for the prayer, he (the Prophet ) rode 
and I rode behind Abi Talha and my foot was touching that of the 
Prophet.
<P>
The inhabitants of Khaibar came out with their baskets and spades and 
when they saw the Prophet they shouted 'Muhammad! By Allah, Muhammad 
and his army.' When Allah's Apostle saw them, he said, "Allahu-Akbar! 
Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is ruined. Whenever we approach a (hostile) 
nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning of those who have 
been warned."
