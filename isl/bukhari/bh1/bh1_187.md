Allah's Apostle came to us at noon and water for ablution was brought to
him. After he had performed ablution, the remaining water was taken by
the people and they started smearing their bodies with it (as a blessed

then threw a mouthful of water in the tumbler and said to both of us
(Abu Musa and Bilal), "Drink from the tumbler and pour some of its water
