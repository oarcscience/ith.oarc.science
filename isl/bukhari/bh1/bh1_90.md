*Narrated Zaid bin Khalid Al-Juhani:*

A man asked the Prophet about the picking up of a "Luqata" (fallen lost
thing). The Prophet replied, "Recognize and remember its tying material
and its container, and make public announcement (about it) for one year,
then utilize it but give it to its owner if he comes." Then the person
asked about the lost camel. On that, the Prophet got angry and his
cheeks or his Face became red and he said, "You have no concern with it
as it has its water container, and its feet and it will reach water, and
eat (the leaves) of trees till its owner finds it." The man then asked
about the lost sheep. The Prophet replied, "It is either for you, for
your brother (another person) or for the wolf."
