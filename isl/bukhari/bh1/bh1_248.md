### Hadith 1:248

*Narrated 'Aisha:*

Whenever the Prophet took a bath after Janaba he started by washing his
hands and then performed ablution like that for the prayer. After that
he would put his fingers in water and move the roots of his hair with
them, and then pour three handfuls of water over his head and then pour
water all over his body.

[Next: 1:249: Maimuna: (the wife of the Prophet) Allah's Apostle
performed ablution like that...](bh1_249)
