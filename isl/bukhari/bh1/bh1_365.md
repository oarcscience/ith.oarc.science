### Hadith 1:365

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

On the Day of Nahr (10th of Dhul-Hijja, in the year prior to the last
Hajj of the Prophet when Abu Bakr was the leader of the pilgrims in that
Hajj) Abu Bakr sent me along with other announcers to Mina to make a
public announcement: "No pagan is allowed to perform Hajj after this
year and no naked person is allowed to perform the Tawaf around the
Ka'ba. Then Allah's Apostle sent 'All to read out the Surat Bara'a
(At-Tauba) to the people; so he made the announcement along with us on
the day of Nahr in Mina: "No pagan is allowed to perform Hajj after this
year and no naked person is allowed to perform the Tawaf around the
Ka'ba."
