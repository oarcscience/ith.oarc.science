A woman asked 'Aisha, "Should I offer the prayers that which I did not
offer because of menses" 'Aisha said, "Are you from the Huraura' (a 
town in Iraq?) We were with the Prophet and used to get our periods 
but he never ordered us to offer them (the Prayers missed during 
menses)." 'Aisha perhaps said, "We did not offer them."
