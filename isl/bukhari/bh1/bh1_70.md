### Hadith 1:71

*Narrated Muawiya:*

I heard Allah's Apostle saying, "If Allah wants to do good to a person,
He makes him comprehend the religion. I am just a distributor, but the
grant is from Allah. (And remember) that this nation (true Muslims) will
keep on following Allah's teachings strictly and they will not be harmed
by any one going on a different path till Allah's order (Day of
Judgment) is established."
