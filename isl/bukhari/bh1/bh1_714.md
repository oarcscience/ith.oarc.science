### Hadith 1:712

*Narrated Asma' bint Abi Bakr:*

The Prophet once offered the eclipse prayer. He stood for a long time
and then did a prolonged bowing. He stood up straight again and kept on
standing for a long time, then bowed a long bowing and then stood up
straight and then prostrated a prolonged prostration and then lifted his
head and prostrated a prolonged prostration. And then he stood up for a
long time and then did a prolonged bowing and then stood up straight
again and kept on standing for a long time. Then he bowed a long bowing
and then stood up straight and then prostrated a prolonged prostration
and then lifted his head and went for a prolonged prostration. On
completion o the prayer, he said, "Paradise became s near to me that if
I had dared, I would have plucked one of its bunches for you and Hell
became so near to me that said, 'O my Lord will I be among those
people?' Then suddenly I saw a woman and a cat was lacerating her with
it claws. On inquiring, it was said that the woman had imprisoned the
cat till it died of starvation and she neither fed it no freed it so
that it could feed itself."
