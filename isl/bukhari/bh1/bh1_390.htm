<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:389</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Amr bin Dmar:</I></P>
I asked Ibn 'Umar, "Can a person who has performed the Tawaf around 
the Ka'ba for 'Umra but has not performed the (Sa'i) Tawaf of Safa and
Marwa, have a sexual relation with his wife?" Ibn 'Umar replied "When 
the Prophet reached Mecca he performed the Tawaf around the Ka'ba 
(circumambulated it seven times) and offered a two-Rak'at prayer (at 
the place) behind the station (of Abraham) and then performed the 
Tawaf (Sa'i) of Safa and Marwa, and verily in Allah's Apostle you have
a good example." Then we put the same question to Jabir bin 'Abdullah 
and he too replied, "He should not go near his wife (for sexual 
relation) till he has finished the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa."
