<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:118</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
People say that I have narrated many Hadiths (The Prophet's 
narrations). Had it not been for two verses in the Qur'an, I would not
have narrated a single Hadith, and the verses are:
<P>
"Verily those who conceal the clear sign and the guidance which We 
have sent down . . . (up to) Most Merciful." (2:159-160). And no doubt
our Muhajir (emigrant) brothers used to be busy in the market with 
their business (bargains) and our Ansari brothers used to be busy with
their property (agriculture). But I (Abu Huraira) used to stick to 
Allah's Apostle contented with what will fill my stomach and I used to
attend that which they used not to attend and I used to memorize that 
which they used not to memorize.
