<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:26</H3><P><I>Narrated Sa'd:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle distributed (Zakat) amongst (a group of) people while 
I was sitting there but Allah's Apostle left a man whom I thought the 
best of the lot. I asked, "O Allah's Apostle! Why have you left that 
person? By Allah I regard him as a faithful believer." The Prophet 
commented: "Or merely a Muslim." I remained quiet for a while, but 
could not help repeating my question because of what I knew about him.
And then asked Allah's Apostle, "Why have you left so and so? By 
Allah! He is a faithful believer." The Prophet again said, "Or merely 
a Muslim." And I could not help repeating my question because of what 
I knew about him. Then the Prophet said, "O Sa'd! I give to a person 
while another is dearer to me, for fear that he might be thrown on his
face in the Fire by Allah."
