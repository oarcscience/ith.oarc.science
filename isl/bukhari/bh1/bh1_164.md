*Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Amr:*

The Prophet remained behind us on a journey. He joined us while we were
performing ablution for the 'Asr prayer which was over-due and we were
just passing wet hands over our feet (not washing them thoroughly) so he
addressed us in a loud voice saying twice orthriae, "Save your heels
from the fire."
