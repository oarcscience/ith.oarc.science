### Hadith 1:56

*Narrated Abu Huraira:*

While the Prophet was saying something in a gathering, a Bedouin came
and asked him, "When would the Hour (Doomsday) take place?" Allah's
Apostle continued his talk, so some people said that Allah's Apostle had
heard the question, but did not like what that Bedouin had asked. Some
of them said that Alllah's Apostle had not heard it. When the Prophet
finished his speech, he said, "Where is the questioner, who enquired
about the Hour (Doomsday)?" The Bedouin said, "I am here, O Allah's
Apostle ." Then the Prophet said, "When honesty is lost, then wait for
the Hour (Doomsday)." The Bedouin said, "How will that be lost?" The
Prophet said, "When the power or authority comes in the hands of unfit
persons, then wait for the Hour (Doomsday.)"
