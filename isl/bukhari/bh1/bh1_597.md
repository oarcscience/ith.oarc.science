### Hadith 1:595

*Narrated 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud:*

The Prophet said, "The Adhan pronounced by Bilal should not stop you
from taking Suhur, for he pronounces the Adhan at night, so that the one
offering the late night prayer (Tahajjud) from among you might hurry up
and the sleeping from among you might wake up. It does not mean that
dawn or morning has started." Then he (the Prophet) pointed with his
fingers and raised them up (towards the sky) and then lowered them
(towards the earth) like this (Ibn Mas'ud imitated the gesture of the
Prophet). Az-Zuhri gestured with his two index fingers which he put on
each other and then stretched them to the right and left. These gestures
illustrate the way real dawn appears. It spreads left and right
horizontally. The dawn that appears in the high sky and lowers down is
not the real dawn) .
