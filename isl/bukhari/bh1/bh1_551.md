### Hadith 1:549

*Narrated Anas:*

Zaid bin Thabit said, "We took the "Suhur" (the meal taken before dawn
while fasting is observed) with the Prophet and then stood up for the
(morning) prayer." I asked him how long the interval between the two
(Suhur and prayer) was. He replied, 'The interval between the two was
just sufficient to recite fifty to Sixth 'Ayat."

[Next: 1:550: Qatada: Anas bin Malik said, The Prophet and Zaid bin
Thabit took the 'Suhur'...](bh1_552)
