### Hadith 1:775

*Narrated Al-Bara' bin 'Azib:*

(and he was not a liar) We used to pray behind the Prophet and when he
said, "Sami' a-l-lahu Liman hamida", none of us would bend his back (to
go for prostration) till the Prophet had placed his, forehead on the
ground.

[Next: 1:776: Ibn 'Abbas: The Prophet said, I have been ordered to
prostrate on seven bones ...](bh1_778)
