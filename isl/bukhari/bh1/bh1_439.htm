<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:438</H3><P><I>Narrated 'Ikrima:</I></P>
Ibn 'Abbas said to me and to his son 'Ali, "Go to Abu Sa'id and listen
to what he narrates." So we went and found him in a garden looking 
after it. He picked up his Rida', wore it and sat down and started 
narrating till the topic of the construction of the mosque reached. He
said, "We were carrying one adobe at a time while 'Ammar was carrying 
two. The Prophet saw him and started removing the dust from his body 
and said, "May Allah be Merciful to 'Ammar. He will be inviting them 
(i.e. his murderers, the rebellious group) to Paradise and they will 
invite him to Hell-fire." 'Ammar said, "I seek refuge with Allah from 
affliction."
