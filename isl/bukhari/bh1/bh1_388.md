### Hadith 1:387

*Narrated Anas bin Malik:*

Allah's Apostle said, "I have been ordered to fight the people till they
say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.' And if they say
so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter,
then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not
interfere with them except legally and their reckoning will Malik, "O
Abu Hamza! What makes the life and property of a person sacred?" He
replied, "Whoever says, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah',
faces our Qibla during the prayers, prays like us and eats our
slaughtered animal, then he is a Muslim, and has got the same rights and
obligations as other Muslims have."
