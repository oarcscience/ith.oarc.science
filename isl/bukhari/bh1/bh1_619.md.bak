order for collecting fire-wood (fuel) and then order Someone to
pronounce the Adhan for the prayer and then order someone to lead the
prayer then I would go from behind and burn the houses of men who did

Him, in Whose Hands my soul is, if anyone of them had known that he
would get a bone covered with good meat or two (small) pieces of meat
present in between two ribs, he would have turned up for the 'Isha'
prayer.'
