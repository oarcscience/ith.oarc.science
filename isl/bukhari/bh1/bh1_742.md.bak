### Hadith 1:740

*Narrated Ibn 'Abbas:*

The Prophet set out with the intention of going to Suq 'Ukaz (market of
'Ukaz) along with some of his companions. At the same time, a barrier
was put between the devils and the news of heaven. Fire commenced to be
thrown at them. The Devils went to their people, who asked them, "What
is wrong with you?" They said, "A barrier has been placed between us and
the news of heaven. And fire has been thrown at us." They said, "The
thing which has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven must be
something which has happened recently. Go eastward and westward and see
what has put a barrier between you and the news of heaven." Those who
went towards Tuhama came across the Prophet at a place called Nakhla and
it was on the way to Suq 'Ukaz and the Prophet was offering the Fajr
prayer with his companions. When they heard the Qur'an they listened to
it and said, "By Allah, this is the thing which has put a barrier
between us and the news of heaven." They went to their people and said,
"O our people; verily we have heard a wonderful recital (Qur'an) which
shows the true path; we believed in it and would not ascribe partners to
our Lord." Allah revealed the following verses to his Prophet (Sura
'Jinn') (72): "Say: It has been revealed to me." And what was revealed
to him was the conversation of the Jinns.
