<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Hadith 1:624</H3><P><I>Narrated Abu Huraira:</I></P>
Allah's Apostle said, "While a man was going on a way, he saw a thorny
branch and removed it from the way and Allah became pleased by his 
action and forgave him for that." Then the Prophet said, "Five are 
martyrs: One who dies of plague, one who dies of an abdominal disease,
one who dies of drowning, one who is buried alive (and) dies and one 
who is killed in Allah's cause." (The Prophet further said, "If the 
people knew the reward for pronouncing the Adhan and for standing in 
the first row (in the congregational prayer) and found no other way to
get it except by drawing lots they would do so, and if they knew the 
reward of offering the Zuhr prayer early (in its stated time), they 
would race for it and they knew the reward for 'Isha' and Fajr prayers
in congregation, they would attend them even if they were to crawl')
