### Hadith 1:787

*Narrated Aiyub:*

Abu Qilaba said, "Malik bin Huwairith came to us and led us in the
prayer in this mosque of ours and said, 'I lead you in prayer but I do
not want to offer the prayer but just to show you how Allah's Apostle
performed his prayers." I asked Abu Qilaba, "How was the prayer of Malik
bin Huwairith?" He replied, "Like the prayer of this Sheikh of ours--
i.e. 'Amr bin Salima." That Sheikh used to pronounce the Takbir
perfectly and when he raised his head from the second prostration he
would sit for a while and then support himself on the ground and get up.

[Next: 1:788: Said bin Al-Harith: Abu Said led us in the prayer and said
the Takbir aloud on arising ...](bh1_790)
