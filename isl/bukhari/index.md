# Hadith of Bukhari

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Hadith are anecdotes about Muhammad and other founders of Islam.
They are considered important source material about religious practice,
law, and historical traditions. This is an extensive collection of
Hadith as organized by Muhammad Ismâ'îl al-Bukhârî, one of the most
respected of the Hadith redactors. For more Hadith, see [A Manual of
Hadith](../hadith/index.md).
