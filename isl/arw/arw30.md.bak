### <span class="smallcaps">Exertion, Perseverance, Success</span>

A man obtains only what he strives for.

He who seeks and struggles shall find.

Struggles bring the most unlikely things within reach.

When a man makes up his mind to do a thing it becomes easy for him to do
it.

If you have a clear thought, be decided, and

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

hesitate not—if you decide, hesitate not, but carry it out speedily.

You must be ready to confront difficulties if you would realise your
hopes.

It is the part of man to strive, and not to rely on the favours of
Fortune.

Not every one who seeks shall find, nor every one who is indifferent be
denied.

Beware of giving up hope in what you earnestly seek.

A wise man perseveres, and is not easily turned away.

Not by fitful efforts, but by constancy, is an end secured.

The most profitable labour is that which is most persevering—though it
may not be strenuous.

A moderate success is better than overwhelming work.

Success comes to him who abjures procrastination.

The world is the booty of the skilful.

The most wonderful thing in the world is the success of a fool and the
failure of a wise man.

A pleasing manner is a great aid to success.

It is the duty of man to do his utmost, but he is not responsible for
success.

Do not undertake a work for which you are not competent.

What can a tirewoman do with an ugly face?
