### <span class="smallcaps">Salutation, Visiting</span>

Return a salutation by something better, or at least by something as
good *(Koran)*.

A warm greeting renews friendship.

Respect is due to a visitor.

The best of men is a rich man who visits the poor, and the worst is a
poor man who visits the rich.

Go a mile to see a sick man, go two miles to make peace between two men,
and go three miles to call on a friend.

Make your visits short, especially to the sick.

To visit too often is tiresome to your friends, and to visit too rarely
is less than what is due to friendship.

Your calls will be best appreciated when they are seasonable and not too
frequent.

Too much familiarity is a cause of coolness among friends.

Do not associate much with men; if you do, shut your eyes to their
faults, and bear consequent trouble.
