### <span class="smallcaps">Patience</span>

God is with them that are patient. God loveth them that are patient
*(Koran)*.

Patience is one-half of religious duty.

There are two kinds of patience—one is for something which you desire,
the other in something which you hate; and he is a strong man who can
combine them both.

Patience is mostly needed at the first shock.

Grief is dispelled by patience.

The device of a man who hath no device is patience.

So long as there is a claimant, no just case is ever lost.

Patience is a bitter cup, which the strong alone can drink.

A misfortune is one, but it becomes two to the impatient.

Patience is one of the gifts of heaven.

He who is impatient to hear one word will have to listen to many words.

Difficulties can be overcome only by patience.

It is a good omen when your messenger is delayed.

Rarely does a patient man fail in obtaining that which he seeks.

Be patient—every cloud dissipates, and every evil which does not
continue is a small thing.

He who receives the strokes is not like him who counts them.
