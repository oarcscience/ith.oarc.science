A good character is a great boon.

Kind words are the bonds of love.

A kind word is like an act of charity.

If you cannot help men with money, help them with a cheerful face and a
kindly bearing.

No man is entitled to consideration unless he has these three things, or
at least one of them: the fear of God to restrain him from evil,

with wicked men, and a good nature towards all.

There are cases where not kindness but severity is necessary.

Kindness increases the love of friends, and diminishes the hatred of

Be firm after you have been kind.

God loves the man who is tender-hearted.

An evil nature is a calamity from which there is no escape.

you hear that a man has changed his character do not believe it, for he
will act only according to his nature.

An inherited quality may be traced back to the seventh grandfather.

There are four points in a good character from which all other good
traits take their origin—prudence, courage, continence, and justice.

When a woman has had more than one husband in this life, she will, in
the future state, be free to be the wife of him whose character she
esteemed the most.
