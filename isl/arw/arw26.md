### Truthfulness

*Koran.*    O ye that believe, fear God and be truthful! Verily God
recompenseth the truthfulness of the truthful.

*Traditions.*    Be ever truthful, for truthfulness leads to
righteousness, and righteousness leads to heaven.

Veracity brings peace to the heart.

No man's religion can be right until his heart become right, nor can his
heart become right until his tongue is right.

Keep to the truth though it may harm thee, and keep away from falsehood
though it may profit thee.

A man can be perfect only when he speaks the truth and acts according to
the truth.

*Proverbs.*    Truth is the sword of God, which always cleaves when it
smites.

Truth is armed with horns.

By truth man is saved from evil.

If falsehood saves from trouble truth saves much more.

When thou speakest be truthful, and when thou actest be gentle.

An ignorant man who is true is better than a clever man who is false.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

There are two kinds of truthfulness, and the greatest of them is that
which may do thee harm.

If truth and falsehood were pictured they would be represented by a
terrible lion and a cunning fox.

It is better to die a truthful man than to live the life of a liar.
