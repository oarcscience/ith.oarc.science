### <span class="smallcaps">Marriage</span>

The advantages of marriage are purity of life, children, pleasures of
home, and the happiness of exertion for the comfort of wife and
children.

This life is a joy, and its greatest delight is a good wife.

An honourable marriage is a stepping-stone to honour.

Take a wife not for her beauty, but for her virtues.

Chastity united to beauty makes a wife perfect.

Three things contribute to long life—a large house, an obedient wife,
and a swift horse.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

The violence of love vanishes soon after marriage. If the love of bride
and bridegroom were to endure, the Resurrection Day would be at hand.

A man has no portion in the love of women when he becomes grey, or when
he loses his fortune.

The lover's eye is blind.

The disgrace of a woman is abiding.

Take the high-road, though it turn; and marry a woman of good birth,
though she may have been passed by.

Women are the snares of Satan.

Happy is the woman who dies before her husband.

It is better to have a thousand enemies out of the house than one in it.

The girl who has many suitors, and makes no choice of one of them, is
doomed to become an old maid.
