<p>Reason is a light in the heart which distinguishes between truth and error.</p>  
<p>A wise man sees with his heart what a fool does not see with his eyes.</p>  
<p>Men should be judged according to their lights (reason).</p>  
<p>A wise man is not he who considers how he may get out of an evil, but he who sees that he does not fall into it.</p>  
<p>Actions are judged by their endings. If you desire a thing, consider its end.</p>  
<p>A man cannot be wise without experience.</p>  
<p>No wise man will be bitten twice from the same den.</p>  
<p>No boon is so remunerative as reason.</p>  
<p>Long experience is an addition to mind.</p>  
<p>Consideration may take the place of experience.</p>  
<p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="green">p. 30</font></A></p>  
<p>A wise man is he who has been taught by experience.</p>  
<p>One word is sufficient to the wise man.</p>  
<p>A cheap offer makes a wise purchaser wary.</p>  
<p>He who considers consequences will attain his object, and he who does not carefully think on them, evil will be sure to overtake him.</p>  
<p>Everything has need of reason, and reason has need of experience.</p>  
<p>Mind and experience are like water and earth co-operating&#8212;neither of which alone can bring forth a flower.</p>  
<p>Reason and anxious thought are inseparable.</p>  
<p>A wise man is never happy. (For in much wisdom is much grief, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.&#8212;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Eccles</span>. i. 18.)</p>
