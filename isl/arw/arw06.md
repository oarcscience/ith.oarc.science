### <span class="smallcaps">A Sinner's Cry unto God</span> <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4)

O Thou who knowest every thought, and hearest every cry,  
Who art the source of all that is, or ever shall be,  
Who art the only hope in every trouble,  
The only help in every plaint and every woe,  
Whose treasures of bounty and word creative are one,  
God of all good, hear my prayer!

One sole plea I have—my need of Thee;  
But needing Thee my need is filled.  
One only resource I have—to stand and knock;  
And if unheard at Thy mercy-gate, to whom shall I go?

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Whom shall I call,
what Name shall I invoke,  
If Thy needy servant shall in vain Thy bounty seek?  
But far be it from Thee, God of grace, to refuse a sinner's cry.  
Too good and gracious art Thou to send me thus away.

Contrite, I stand at Thy door,  
Believing that contrite prayer availeth much with Thee.  
Suppliant, I stretch forth my hands,  
And with all my soul look up to Thee.  
Save me, God, from every ill, and be Thy favour ever mine!
