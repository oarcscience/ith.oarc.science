### <span class="smallcaps">Clemency, Forbearance, and Gentleness</span>

*Koran.*    Those who worship the Merciful One are they who walk on the
earth gently, and who, when fools speak to them, say "Peace." (25, 64.)

*Traditions    *Be friendly to him who would be unfriendly to you, give
him who will not give you, and forbear with him who would do you harm.

Next to faith in God, the chief duty of man is to treat his fellow men
with gentleness and courtesy.

*Sayings and Proverbs.*    Gentleness is one of the noblest traits in a
man's character.

A gentle man is a man of great beauty.

One of the surest evidences of gentleness is tenderness to fools.

The fierce anger of a foolish man is checked by gentleness as a fierce
fire is extinguished by water.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

Gentleness is sometimes an humiliation, and he who is always forbearing
and patient may be trodden down by fools.

If you honour a vile man, you disgrace the code of honour.
