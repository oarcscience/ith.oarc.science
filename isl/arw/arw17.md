### <span class="smallcaps">Flaunting Kindness</span>

To carry a heavy rock to the summit of a mountain is easier than to
receive a kindness which is flaunted.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

The bane of a generous action is to mention it.

It is better to refuse a kindness than to be reminded of it.

I would not accept the whole world if I were to suffer the humiliation
of being constantly reminded of the gift.

To bestow and flaunt a kindness, and to be stingy and refuse to do an
act of kindness, are equally bad.

When you do a kindness hide it, and when a kindness is done to you
proclaim it.

Do good, and throw it into the sea.
