### <span class="smallcaps">Consultation</span>

If you consult a wise man, his wisdom becomes yours.

Confide your secret to one only, and hear the counsel of a thousand. (In
the multitude of counsellors there is safety. <span
class="smallcaps">Prov</span>. xi. 14.)

A counsellor is a trusted man.

When men consult together, they are led by the wisest among them.

The knowledge of two is better than the knowledge of one. Two heads are
better than one.

Let your counsellor be one who fears God.

Consult a man of experience, for he gives you what has cost him much,
and for which you give nothing.

A man who is older than yourself by a day is more experienced than you
by a year.

Consult an older man and a younger, then decide for yourself.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

The wisest may need the advice of others.

He who is wise, and consults others, is a whole man; he who has a wise
opinion of his own, and seeks no counsel from others, is half a man; and
he who has no opinion of his own, and seeks no advice, is no man at all.

No man can be sorry for seeking advice, or happy if he blindly follows
out his own thoughts.
