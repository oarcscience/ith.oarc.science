<p>The difference between envy and emulation is, that in the first the desire is for the cessation of a good enjoyed by another, and in the second the desire is for the possession of a similar good.</p>  
<p>An envious man is angry with God for His favours to other men.</p>  
<p>Every favoured man is envied.</p>  
<p>A lordly man is always an object of admiration or of envy.</p>  
<p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></A></p>  
<p>Beware of envy, for it shows itself in you, not in him whom you envy.</p>  
<p>Envy is a disease for which there is no cure.</p>  
<p>Envy is a disease which does more harm to the envious than to the envied.</p>  
<p>All enmity may be overcome except that which comes from envy.</p>  
<p>There can be no peace in the heart of an envious man.</p>  
<p>A man cannot be happy if he be malicious, envious, or ill-tempered.</p>  
<p>Keep your affairs to yourself, for every favoured man is an object of envy.</p>  
<p>Envy may be cured only by a sure knowledge that it is a cause of much pain to you and no evil to him whom you envy&#8212;so you must shun it if you would not be an enemy to yourself and a friend to your enemy.</p>  
<p>Envy consumes man, as rust corrodes iron.</p>  
<p>He who strains his neck to look at one above him gets nothing but pain.</p>  
<p>Envy no man except him who is good.</p>
