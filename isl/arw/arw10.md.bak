### <span class="smallcaps">True Nobility</span>

True nobility lies in high character and refined manners, not in noble
birth or ancient pedigree.

A noble man is he who aims at noble ends—not he who glories in an
ancestry mouldering in the dust.

A noble man is noble though he come to want, and a base man is base
though he walks on pearls.

A lion is a lion though his claws be clipped, and a dog is a dog though
he wear a collar of gold.

He who disregards his own honour gets no good from an honourable
lineage.

Learning and high principles take the place of noble birth, and cover
the shame of a low origin.

A branch tells of what stock it comes.
