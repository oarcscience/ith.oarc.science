### <span class="smallcaps">Economy</span>

Economy saves half the cost of living.

The value of economy is equal to half of your profits,

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

Frugality saves a man from poverty.

Little with economy is better than much with waste.

Poverty with freedom from debt is great wealth.

If you count beforehand you will thrive.

The sea is made up of drops and the mountain of grains.

My son, take a middle course between stinginess and extravagance,
parsimony and prodigality.

Extravagance dissipates great riches, and economy increases them when
they are small.

Extravagance ever leads to misery and ruin.

Extravagance does as much harm to life as it adds to the pleasures of
living.

In all things take a middle course.

Charity lies between two charities—one to yourself, the other to your
needy fellow man.

If you are too soft you will be squeezed, and if you are too dry you
will be broken.

He who spends and reckons not, ends in ruin and knows not.

He who buys cheap meat will regret his purchase when it is served up.
