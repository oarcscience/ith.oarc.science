<p>To keep a secret is a divine law.</p>  
<p>A secret is a trust, and to betray it is perfidy.</p>  
<p>The least of all noble traits is to keep a secret, and the greatest is to forget it.</p>  
<p>He controls himself most who hides a secret from his friends.</p>  
<p>When a secret is known to more than two, it becomes public.</p>  
<p>He who seeks a place to hide his secret reveals it.</p>  
<p>Walls have ears.</p>  
<p>It is unwise to confide a secret to two tongues and four ears.</p>  
<p>Your secret is your captive, betray it and you become its captive.</p>  
<p>A man should be a tomb in which a secret is deposited.</p>  
<p>If you keep your secret you are safe, and it will be to your sorrow if you reveal it.</p>  
<p>Hearts are the depositaries of secrets, lips their locks, and tongues their keys.</p>  
<p>The hearts of the wise are the fortresses of secrets.</p>
