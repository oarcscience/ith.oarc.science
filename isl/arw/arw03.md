### INTRODUCTION

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> wise sayings and proverbs of ancient
and modern times, and in all the languages I know or to which I had
access in translations, have always had a great attraction for me. Drawn
from the experiences and study of human life, they have been reduced by
wise men to short, pithy sentences, generally expressed in some quaint
or striking form, for conveying sound moral truths. They are intended to
be maxims of life, or rules of conduct, chiefly for the young, but may
be read with pleasure and profit by both young and old. It was with such
an object in view that the Editors of the *Wisdom of the East* series
have lately issued a number of small books on this subject carefully
translated by competent specialists, and which have been highly
appreciated by the English press and public. Their chief desire,
however, appears to be "that these books shall be the ambassadors

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

of good-will and understanding between East and West," and also that
"the great ideals and lofty philosophy of Oriental thought may help to a
revival of that true spirit of Charity which neither despises nor fears
the nations of another creed and colour." (See Editorial Note.)

It was also from such motives, but long before I had seen these books,
that I have employed a part of my leisure hours in translating into
Arabic some of the best sayings of M. Aurelius, Shakespeare, Tennyson,
English and other proverbs, and, quite lately, selections from *The
Instruction of Ptah-Hotep* and *Sadi's* *Scroll of Wisdom.* They were
published in the best Arabic magazines, and have been read by many
Christians, Moslems, and Jews in Egypt, Syria, and other countries; and
I have been told by some of these Oriental readers that they found in
them much matter for thought and instruction, while their views of the
community and bonds of human nature among all nations, and in all parts
of the world, have been broadened and enlarged.

The Arabic language is particularly rich in this kind of literature, and
its proverbs are often appropriately introduced in conversation,
letters, and books, and add much force to what is said or written. Many
are light and colloquial, and bring a smile or laughter to both speaker
and hearer; but many also are distinguished by their classical form and
the serious weighty ideas

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

which they convey or inculcate. It was easy, therefore, to find abundant
material for this little book, but it was somewhat difficult to make a
wise selection, to classify the different subjects under proper heads,
and to translate Arabic idioms into good English. Other difficulties
were when the proverb in Arabic is formed of two parts which assonate or
rhyme, when the piquancy of a short sentence depends so much on the
quaintness of its expression, when an untranslatable pun or play upon
words is used, or when the phrase is too elliptical or too Oriental in
its reference to be easily understood by English readers. The
translation I have made is generally literal, sometimes free, but always
true to the original. Some I have left in their Oriental form to show
the Arabian bent of thought and mode of life. The renderings from the
Koran are all mine, and I alone am responsible for them. All that I have
tried to do was for ordinary readers—and for them alone.

Many proverbs are common to all languages, and in them all—notably among
Semitic nations—there is often an exaggeration, <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) or a one-sided view, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) or a paradox, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) which must be taken with

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

some latitude and with the natural limitations required by common sense.
It will also be observed that many Arabic proverbs have a close
resemblance to the Proverbs of Solomon, and often assume that rhetorical
form or parallelism in which Hebrew poetry abounds when the same idea is
repeated in other words, or where its positive and negative sides are
put into contrast. The following quotation, taken from the eighth
chapter of that book, may serve as an example of what has just been
said, and as an appropriate introduction to this little book:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Doth not wisdom cry,  
And understanding put forth her voice?  
Unto you, O men, I call;  
And my voice is to the sons of men.  
For my mouth shall utter truth;  
And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.  
For whoso findeth me findeth life,  
And shall obtain favour of the Lord.  
But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul:  
All they that hate me love death."

</div>
