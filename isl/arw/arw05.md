### <span class="smallcaps">Repentance, and God's Forgiving Mercy</span>

*Koran.*    O ye who believe, repent unto God, for He loveth them who
are penitent. O ye who believe in me, who by much sin have done a

great wrong to themselves, despair not of the mercy of God, for He
forgiveth all sins. Verily He forgiveth and is merciful.

*Traditions*.    Sorrow for sin is repentance. He who repents is like
him who has not sinned.

*Wise Sayings and Proverbs.*    No intercession succeeds so effectually
as repentance.

The most truthful man is he who is true to his repentance.

Two sins only God does not forgive—worship of false gods and injury to
men.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[15:1](arw04.htm#fr_3) This opening chapter of
the Koran—very short as it is—contains the fundamental principles of the
whole book—the doctrine of God, His infinite mercy, the immortality of
the soul, the rewards and punishments of the world to come, and the duty
of prayer, and thanksgiving, and adoration, and obedience. It is a fair
specimen of all that is best in the "Revealed Book" of the Moslems, and
is as frequently repeated by them as the Lord's Prayer is by Christians.
