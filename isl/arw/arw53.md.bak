### <span class="smallcaps">Love of Country and Home</span>

Love of one's own country is a religious duty.

A true man yearns towards his native country, and longs for his home as
a lion longs for his lair.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

It is a sign of sound judgment when the heart craves for country and
home.

He is better to suffer hardship in one's own country than to enjoy ease
in a foreign land.

God blesses the land which is loved by its people.

As a nurse who has brought you up, has a special claim on you, so has
your country.

He is an unwise man who alienates himself from his country and home.

If it were not for love of country, unhappy lands would be desolate.

It is an honour to you to love the land and house where you were born.

An old man is most comfortable in his own house.
