### <span class="smallcaps">Thoughts, Doubts</span>

Most thoughts are wishes.

The thoughts of the wise are more trustworthy than the convictions of
fools.

Do not confuse opinions with certainties.

If you are doubtful of a thing let it alone.

Remove doubts by enquiry.

A thing that is heard is not like a thing that is seen.

Do not believe all that you hear.

It is not wise to be sure of a thing only because you think so.

Where there is much difference of opinion it is difficult to know the
truth.

To think well of others is a religious duty.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

He who thinks well of others is a happy man.

He who has an evil thing in him thinks all men are like him.

If a man think well of you, make his thought true.

A poet says: "It was my habit to think well of others until experience
taught me otherwise."

Be well with God and fear nothing.

Most men think well of themselves, and this is self-delusion.
