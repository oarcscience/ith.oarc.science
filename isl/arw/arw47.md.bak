### <span class="smallcaps">Children</span>

Children are a gift from God.

A child is a flower which has come down from Paradise.

Nothing is dearer than a child, except a grandchild.

When your son is young, train him; when he is grown, make a brother of
him.

That child is loved most who is young until

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

he is grown up, or sick until he recovers, or absent until he returns
home.

Your riches and your children are a temptation to you *(Koran)*.

Happy is the woman who has first daughters, then sons.

If you do not train up your child, time will do it.

The training of children is like chewing stones.

Your riches and children are your enemies—beware of them *(Koran)*.

The joy of parents in their children prolongs life.

Sorrow for a child is a burning fire in the heart.

He who is not tender to his child shall find no tenderness in God to
him.

Your children are not too many for Death, nor is your money too much for
a rapacious governor.
