### <span class="smallcaps">Silence, Guarded Speech</span>

Wise men are silent.

Silence is often more eloquent than words.

Be not hasty with your tongue. If words are silver, silence is gold.

Not all that is known should be said.

Silence is a wise thing, but they who observe it are few.

When the mind becomes large speech becomes little.

Restrain your tongue from saying anything but what is good.

An unguarded word may do you great harm.

A man who talks much is open to much blame.

The most faulty of men are they that are most loquacious in matters
which do not concern them.

To guard his tongue is one of the best traits in a man's character.

Man is saved from much evil if he guard his tongue.

The tongue is a lion which must be chained, and a sharp sword which must
be sheathed.

Nothing on earth is so deserving of a long imprisonment as the tongue.

Beware of saying anything of which you may be ashamed.

It is better to regret a thing which you did not say than a thing which
you did say.

A slip of the foot is safer than a slip of the tongue. A false step may
break a bone which can be set, but a slip of the tongue cannot be
undone.

A thrust of the tongue is sharper than the thrust of a lance.

A word may cause much trouble, destroy a home, or open a grave.

A great tree grows out of a small seed.

The difference between loquacity and silence is like the difference
between the noisy frog and the silent whale.

Wisdom is made up of ten parts—nine of which are silence, and the tenth
is brevity of language.

A man conceals his ignorance by his silence.

He who says what he should not say, will have to hear what he would not
like to hear.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

He who talks much does little.

What is said at night the day blots out.
