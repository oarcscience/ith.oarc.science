# Ismā‛īlī materials

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ismā‛īlīs are a sect of the Shī‛ī branch of Islam. They are regarded
by many in the west today as epitomizing Islamic 'gnosis', and there is
no denying the similarities between their beliefs and those of the more
esoteric versions of Judaism and Christianity. They are considered to be
terrible heretics, however, by many orthodox Muslims, both Sunni and
Shī‛ī, and have been subject to awful persecution at different times in
their history. They are most well-known as the sect of the medieval
'Assassins', and their political clout and numbers were both quite high
in the Middle Ages. Today, however, they are a small community, or
rather, a number of scattered communities, located mostly in Iraq, Iran,
and India.

Until twenty or thirty years ago, there was very little study of the
Ismā‛īlīs in the west. That has begun to change drastically, however,
and anyone interested in learning more about them should be able to find
material with very little trouble. The work of Farhad Daftary, an
Ismā‛īlī himself, as well as a great scholar, is a good place to start.
The files indexed below are by Edward E. Salisbury, and were originally
published in The *Journal of the American Oriental Society*. The first
two files (after the Introduction) are actually anti-Ismā‛īlī tracts by
orthodox heresiologists. The last two files are expositions of Ismā‛īlī
doctrine, apparently from divergent sources. These may be the only
source material available in the public domain in English. Any notices
of additional available material would be greatly appreciated.
