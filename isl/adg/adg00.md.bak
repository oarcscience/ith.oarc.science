This is a humble translation for a book that can be considered modern,
but the information it contains are of antiquity. This is the book of
"2500 adages for imam Ali (puh)." The book might not contain exactly
that number of adages but it might be some number around that.

The book categorizes the adages and sayings in different chapters, each
contain a specific branch of life. At the end of the book, there is the
"poetic adages" which I have translated without keeping the rhyme, but
meaning, as much as possible. The main translations are taken by
meanings and not by translating word for word method, for there are
different obstacles that are not avoidable in this way.

A little introduction might be useful to know who is imam Ali (puh).
Imam Ali is the cousin of prophet Mohammed (puh), and as Shiites
believe, he is the rightful successor and leader to be after the death
of prophet Mohammed (puh). But unfortunately, his rights are taken from
him and later he became in what is called "Islamic History" to be the
fourth caliph for Muslims at that time, ending the period known as the
time of "Al-Kholafa' Al-Rashideen" (The guided caliphs). The event of
his rule and his rights and what happened to him after the prophet's
death is still shrouded with dark clouds, and it is still the main
course of debate among the two main branches of Islam, Shia and Sunni.

In this translation I preferred to use the word "Allah" instead of "God"
because "God" has also another word in Arabic.  
My own comments and understanding of some phrases are enclosed by "\[
\]," while explanations or further translations are enclosed by "( )."
The abbreviation "puh" is the short form of "peace upon him," which is a
frequently used phrase by Muslims for dignify a holy person. However,
some other phrases can be fit to be translations to this after all.

I hope you enjoy the deep meanings in this books and I hope that the
obstacle of the language put down and get the benefits from the wisdom
mentioned in these coming lines.
