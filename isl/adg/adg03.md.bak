The talk about imam Ali (puh) is branched to many fields, for every
field of virtues, he (puh) was the first to indulge himself into it, and
what such few pages would do to talk about him and about his many
virtues, and it is enough to be taken as a clue, the speech of Ibn
Abbaas, the rabbi of this nation with his knowledge, and it is narrated
that a man asked Ibn Abbaas and said: how many are the virtues of Ali
ben Abi Taalib, and I think they are 3,000... Then said Ibn Abbaas: It
is closer to 30,000 more than 3,000; and then he said: if trees were
made into pens and the sea into an ink and humans and djinns were
writers and calculators, they will never count the virtues of the prince
of believers (puh).

But for the wisdom the says, what cannot be reached all, its partitions
are not to be left, and who missed the abundance should take what is
left over, we are here seeking to show some of the eloquence that the
imam had, to be an introduction to read this book, which contains pearls
and wonderful things from the adages of the imam, that stand as a clue
for his long experience in this field.

Eloquence:

And before speaking about the eloquence of the imam (puh), we must stop
with eloquence and its definition, in language and in general.  
Ibn Mandhoor defines eloquence as to be the purity of language, and adds
in his speech about the eloquent man: the good speech is its purest, and
reaches by the phrase of the tongue, the interior of what is in the
heart.  
Sheikh Al-Torayhi expands what Ibn Mandhoor said, and makes a condition
for the eloquent speech on 3 terms: the correctness of the language, and
a coincidence to the desired meaning, and truthfulness in the soul.  
In general, it is obvious that the eloquent speech is the purity of the
talk and its shortness, or what achieves the meaning in the closest way,
and eloquence in the speech includes all the types of speeches, from
speeches and prose and poetry and thoughts and sermons...etc.  
And here we will encounter only the adages and the sermons, some of them
which came in form of a poetry or as a prose, for both of them are one,
for poetry in its shape and style, is not what charms the minds, but it
is what it carries of eternal meanings.  
The wise saying, is born from the experience and meditating and
conclusion, and it is a phase that passed over the level of the
childhood of the thought and its youth to the level of its old age; on
the other hand, the sermons coincide with adages for they are the result
of meditating and experimenting, but they are special because they are
specialized for inviting people for the after-life and hating the finite
life.

Eloquence of the imam; Adages as an Example  
\* *<u>The facts that affected his adages:</u>*

Maybe one of the most obvious things that affected the adages of the
imam, is the religion of Islam, and mainly the book of Allah that was
revealed, that is Quran. For Quran is the topmost in eloquence and
purity in language, and it is enough as a clue for this, how the
eloquent speakers of Arabs stood up surprised in front of the greatness
of its own eloquence, while they are the great owners of literature and
the giants of thought and eloquence.  
Adding to that, the imam had a noble soul and did not accept to see the
people under humiliation. These characters are encouraged by Islam, thus
the imam (puh) went on starting from his own self and feeding his
thought with the teachings of Islam, he went on to build a unique
community depending on unique ideas that he (puh) explained in his
adages and his speeches.  
Types of adages and their subjects: the adages of imam Ali (puh)
included the different fields of life, like religion, community,
manners, sermons and politics.  
And they are considered adages because they are general and applicable
for every place and time, and the clue for this is, is how they
persisted with time, as a live witness for how great is the imam.  
Their characteristics and specialities: the adages of imam Ali (puh) are
full with meanings of style and alive with the spirit of sincerity and
belief, and alloyed in a block of stylized expression, so much that
Abbaas Mahmood Al-Aqqaad \[a modern writer and author\] said in his book
Abqariyatul-Imam (The Ingenuity of the Imam): They are (the adages) more
eloquent in expression and has an abundance in beauty of the speech.

Testimonies About The Eloquence of the Imam:

\- Abdul-Hameed Al-Kaatib said: I memorized seventy speeches from the
speeches of the bald man, and they flooded me and flooded me again.
\[The bald man was a title used by the enemies of imam Ali (puh) as to
mock at him\].

\- His eloquence even attracted his fierce enemy, Mo'awiyah, when he
said, when Mahnaf ben Abi-Mahnaf said to him: I came to you from the
sickest of people, and he answered him: Woe to you! how come he is the
sickest of people! by Allah no one spread the eloquence for Quraish
\[the tribe of the prophet\] except of him.  
But after all the most truthful witness in all of that, is how these
adages persisted all the time, despite the many enemies of the imam, no
one dared to mention them with badness.
