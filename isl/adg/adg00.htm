<p>This is a humble translation for a  book that can be considered modern, but the information it contains are of  antiquity. This is the book of "2500 adages for imam Ali (puh)." The book might  not contain exactly that number of adages but it might be some number around  that.</p>  
<p>The book categorizes the adages  and sayings in different chapters, each contain a specific branch of life. At  the end of the book, there is the "poetic adages" which I have translated  without keeping the rhyme, but meaning, as much as possible. The main  translations are taken by meanings and not by translating word for word method,  for there are different obstacles that are not avoidable in this way.</p>  
<p>A little introduction might be  useful to know who is imam Ali (puh). Imam Ali is the cousin of prophet Mohammed  (puh), and as Shiites believe, he is the rightful successor and leader to be  after the death of prophet Mohammed (puh). But unfortunately, his rights are  taken from him and later he became in what is called "Islamic History" to be the  fourth caliph for Muslims at that time, ending the period known as the time of  "Al-Kholafa' Al-Rashideen" (The guided caliphs). The event of his rule and his  rights and what happened to him after the prophet's death is still shrouded with  dark clouds, and it is still the main course of debate among the two main  branches of Islam, Shia and Sunni.</p>  
<p>In this translation I preferred to  use the word "Allah" instead of "God" because "God" has also another word in  Arabic.<br> My own comments and understanding of some phrases are enclosed by "[ ]," while  explanations or further translations are enclosed by "( )." The abbreviation "puh"  is the short form of "peace upon him," which is a frequently used phrase by  Muslims for dignify a holy person. However, some other phrases can be fit to be  translations to this after all.</p>  
<p>I hope you enjoy the deep meanings  in this books and I hope that the obstacle of the language put down and get the  benefits from the wisdom mentioned in these coming lines.</p>
