<p>The prince of believers  (puh) said:</p>  
<p>1. Remember the stopping  of the lusts and the remaining of the consequences.<br> 2. Who remembers how far the travel is shall be make himself ready.<br> 3. Leaving is near.<br> 4. The breath of the man is his steps to his end.<br> 5. The people of this life are like riders taken away while they are asleep.<br> 6. The wise man should give for his after-life and build the place of his  living.<br> 7. The beauty of lust do not satisfy the torture of hell.<br> 8. No remains of age with the continuation of day and night.<br> 9. No absent is closer than death.<br> 10. Life is the passage to the after-life.<br> 11. Trusting the life is a stupidity.<br> 12. Age is made of counted breaths.<br> 13. Nothing is more truthful like death.<br> 14. His wishes are granted, who works for the lasting place.<br> 15. No comer is closer than death.<br> 16. Life is a passage and the after-life is a place of settlement.<br> 17. How close is the living to the dead, for soon it will follow.<br> 18. Who asks for death is not spared.<br> 19. It is a trouble to corrupt the after-life.<br> 20. For everything living there is a death.<br> 21. Who remembers how long is the way of travel, should be ready.<br> 22. Who does not prefer the after-life upon this life, he is then mindless.<br> 23. Everything from the after-life is eternal.<br> 24. How is he safe from death who asks for it?<br> 25. Who sees death with the eye of his true belief, he shall see it soon.<br> 26. In working for the after-life, success is reached.<br> 27. Who is certain of the end, shall take a lot of supplies.<br> 28. The absent death is the the one waiting with rights, and the closest comer.<br> 29. I am amazed for an ignorant and death is running after him.<br> 30. The goal of the after-life is eternity.<br> 31. He is busy away from paradise who has the hell in front of him.<br> 32. Mentioning the after-life is a medicine and a cure.<br> 33. Mentioning death, lessens the reasons for life.<br> 34. The sweetness of the after-life removes the bitterness of troubles in this  life.<br> 35. The rewards of the after-life makes you forget the tiresome times of life.<br> 36. Your stay is to end, and your end is to be eternal.<br> 37. Start before the coming of the awaited absent.<br> 38. Start before the take of Almight.<br> 39. Start before the fear (of death) and letting go of the soul.<br> 40. Start with your richness before your poverty and with your life before your  death.<br> 41. If mourners come to you a lot, the mourners shall mourn you.<br> 42. It is an adversity to corrupt the after-life.<br> 43. The one who wins a lot is he who buys the after-life with his life.<br> 44. Where are the giants (Amaliks) and the sons of the giants.<br> 45. Where are the tyrants and the sons of tyrants.<br> 46. Where are those who built the camps and cities.<br> 47. Where are they who said "who is mightier than us, and more numerous."<br> 48. Where is he, who strived and worked, and prepared and collected.<br> 50. Where is he who built and constructed, and spread and prepared (the roads),  and collected and counted. [Wrong numbering  in the book itself, ignore it].</p>  
<p>51. Where is he who fortified and  assured, and ornamented and upholstered.<br> 52. Where are they who were longer than you in lives and made more traces (than  you).<br> 53. Where are the kings and kisras. [Kisra is the title of kingship in Persia in  old days].<br> 54. Where are Bani Al-Asfar (tribe) and the pharaohs. [Bani Al-Asfar, Arabic  for: Children of the yellow one, it might be a title for the Romans and/or  Byzantines, for at that time the Byzantines were already driven out of Arabia].</p>  
<p>55. Where are those who owned the far  lands in the world.<br> 56. Where are they who enslaved the nations.<br> 57. Is there anyone who awakes from his sleep before the time of his death.<br> 58. Is there anyone who gets cautious from his ignorance before his time is  over.<br> 59. Is there anyone who is ready to meet his God before letting go of his soul.<br> 60. Is there anyone who gets the supplies for his after-life before the time of  his leaving.<br> 61. Is there anyone who repents for his sins before the arrival of his death.<br> 62. Be prepared for death for its shade hare hovering over you all.<br> 63. Make your determination and seriousness for your after-life.<br> 64. Paradise is the best end, and the hell is the most devilish of settlements.</p>
