### THE DIWAN OF ZEB-UN-NISSA

#### I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

        To Thee, first,  
From the clouds of Whose mercy is born  
The rose of my garden, I look!  
Let the praise of Thy love the beginning adorn  
    Of the verse of my book.

        Athirst  
For Thy love are my body and soul;  
Like Mansur the grains of this clod,  
My body, cry out—They are parts, Thou the whole,  
    Themselves they are God.

        The waves  
Of Thy deluge of love o’er the boat  
Of mortality roll;  
No Noah could lift from the deeps till it float  
    My love-drownèd soul.

</div>

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

        As slaves  
The powers of the darkness for me  
Will obedient fly;  
If a word of my praise be accepted by Thee,  
    Like Suleiman I.

        And now  
No more do the ready tears start  
As laments from my tongue,  
For like pearls the blood-drops that are drawn from my heart  
    On my lashes are hung.

        Bear thou,  
O Makhfi, with patience thy pain,  
It is endless, and leave thou the night  
Of thy passions; for then shall not Khizr attain  
    Such a spring of delight.

</div>

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

#### II

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="smallcaps">O Thou</span> Who all things mortal and divine  
Hast fashioned, and by Whom alone we live,  
    May there still shine  
The torch of hope that Thou to us didst give!

Within us stirs the leaven of Thy love,  
As streams of water of Thy mercy run.  
    Look from above  
And bless Mahmoud and all that he hath done.

Whether it be in Mecca's holiest shrine,  
Or in the Temple pilgrim feet have trod,  
    Still Thou art mine,  
Wherever God is worshipped is my God.

The morning I shall greet with tears and sighs,  
And from my heart that burns with holy fire  
    A breath shall rise  
To burnish thus my mirror of desire.

Give me thy tears, O Makhfi, let them rain  
In quenching torrents on my burning heart;  
    So hot its pain  
At every sigh I breathe the flames outstart.

</div>

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

#### III

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    <span class="smallcaps">O Prophet</span>, o’er the world  
Thy soul-compelling banner is unfurled:  
    See how thy faith hath spread  
Till Iran and Arabia are led.  
    Thy lips unclose  
Like petals of a newly-budded rose,  
    And from them flow  
Thy words of wisdom, till not only know  
    The sons of men,  
But birds within the garden sing again  
    Thy words of gold.  
O thou whose beauty I with joy behold,  
    Nature in truth  
Made never loveliness like to thy youth.  
    Snared me it hath  
Till fain would I renunciation's path  
    With patience tread,  
And follow where thy holy feet have led.  
    But how can I  
My cherished joys to my poor heart deny,  
    Or, even more,  
My cherished sorrows can I yield, for sore  
    My heart doth bleed  
Where cruel love hath wounded it indeed.

</div>

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

    Look thou and see  
Where from my wounds there drops continually  
    A crimson flood;  
But fragrant flowers are springing from my blood,  
    And every thorn  
Wherewith my weary wandering feet are torn  
    Turns to a rose.  
O Makhfi, if the Kaaba keeper close  
    To thee his door,  
Complain not: thou possessest even more  
    A holy place;  
For look into the Well-Belovèd Face,  
    Over His Eyes  
Arches more fair than Kaaba gates arise;  
    Thy heart shall bend,  
Itself an archway welcoming the Friend.

</div>

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

#### IV

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> eager heart a pang of rapture stings  
   When the long-wandering wind unto me brings  
      The perfume of thy presence on its wings.

And so I wait in this my sorrow's night,  
   Until thou givest to my weary sight  
      Thy beauty for my longing eyes' delight.

The world through Islam light in darkness saw  
   And walked safe guided by thy Scroll of Law,  
      Bowing to God in hope and holy awe—

To God, Who sinners can forgive and lead,  
   Inscrutable Himself, yet Who can read  
      The hidden heart and comprehend its need.

O Prophet, shining like a lonely gem,  
   The fairest of Heaven's highest diadem,  
      Look on men's need and intercede for them.

Thou art the veil through which the light doth shine,  
   Nay, thou thyself the very torch divine—  
      Naught else behold these dazzled eyes of mine.

</div>

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

#### V

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="smallcaps">Here</span> is the path of love—how dark and
long  
    Its winding ways, with many snares beset!  
Yet crowds of eager pilgrims onward throng  
    And fall like doves into the fowler's net.

Now tell me what the grain that drew the dove?  
    The mole it was upon a cheek so fair.  
Tell me of what was wove the net of love?  
    The wandering curls of the Belovèd's hair.

The festival of love is holden here,  
    The goblet passes; drink thou of this wine,  
Yea, drain it to the lees, and never fear  
    Intoxication that is all divine.

How easy ’tis to sigh and to complain!  
    All the world weeps to give its woe relief;  
But proudly in thy heart conceal thy pain,  
    And silent drink the poison of thy grief.

Here is the source of light, the heavenly fount,  
    Here is the vision of eternal grace;  
Brighter than Moses thou, when from the Mount  
    He came, God's radiance shining in his face.

</div>

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The wine at night unto the morning lends  
    Its exaltation, morning to the night  
Its dream bequeaths in turn: so never ends  
    The sequence of the happy soul's delight.

But, Makhfi, tell me where the feast is made?  
    Where are the merry-makers? Lo, apart,  
Here in my soul the feast of God is laid,  
    Within the hidden chambers of my heart.

</div>

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

#### VI

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="smallcaps">My</span> heart is looted of its treasure,
left  
Careless and unprotected, to my shame,  
And thus I weep, feeling myself bereft,  
      Knowing myself to blame.

With mine own hands the altar-fire I lit;  
As flame within a lamp my heart afire  
Glows even through the body casing it,  
      And burns it with desire.

Could I my foolish heart to ashes burn  
Then might I rest, my sorrow then might cease;  
Unto the ocean of Thy love I turn  
      To find within it peace.

I sink within its waters, nor above  
Its surface can my weary limbs uplift,  
Deep-drownèd I within the sea of love  
      Lapped by its waves must drift.

A wilderness this lonely heart of mine  
Till love transformed it to another guise,  
And now it shines as fair as the divine  
      Gardens of Paradise.

</div>

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I would that I my longing might outpour,  
My grief might turn to hymns, my pain might tell  
In psalms like that sweet singer sang of yore,  
      David of Israel.

Unto the fields like pecking birds I go  
To gather up the ears of golden grain,  
But only tears, not corn, I gather—lo,  
      They fall in floods like rain.

O wise one, at the feast of love be glad,  
But careful too, and guard thy cup of wine;  
In ecstasy I drank the share I had,  
      O Sage, take heed of thine.

With slumber, Makhfi, heavy are thine eyes,  
And though thy tale has not attained its close,  
So deep a languor on thy spirit lies;  
      Seek thou for it repose.

</div>

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

#### VII

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As at the coming of the spring-tide rains  
Rivers of sap through growing trees upstart,  
So runs Thy love throughout my very veins,  
Yea, to the tender tendrils of my heart.

I beat my flinty heart till from it flies  
The spark divine of the eternal fire,  
And from the flashing gleams I see arise  
The lightning of Thy love—my heart's desire.

Come, O ye weak in faith, for help is here,  
Behold these flashes from our hearts that fly,  
Had ye the eye of faith they would appear  
Like the white light that gleamed on Sinai.

Come to the feast of love, for it is spread;  
Share ye the wine-cup where we drink so deep;  
Behold the wine—the tears that we have shed,  
The wine-cups are our eyes that ever weep.

But, as we drink, upon us falls the spell,  
The dream, the vision, and the ecstasy;  
The wine of pain turns blood, nor can we tell  
If we exist, or if we cease to be.

</div>

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Within the jungle of this world of woe  
The lion of desire stalks ravenous.  
Girded with faith let us as hunters go:  
If we resist him he will flee from us.

Ofttimes my heart can sing and can rejoice,  
Pouring forth hymns throughout my rapturous days;  
Alas, that powers of evil choke my voice,  
And blast my thoughts, and burn my psalms of praise!

</div>

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

#### VIII

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="smallcaps">From</span> the glance Thou bestowed, O
Belovèd,  
    flows beauty no words can express;  
My life—it were little to offer in thanks for Thy  
    bountifulness.  
How shamed were the pious assembly, how  
    grieved in their hearts when they heard  
That for love of Thy fluttering tresses the utter-  
    most nations were stirred.  
My heart is riven in fragments, ravaged by tears  
    of my grief,  
But to one whom Thy lashes have wounded never  
    there cometh relief.  
At Thy feet, O haughty Belovèd, I lay down the  
    pride of my brow,  
I am near to Thy heart as Thy raiment; why  
    sayest "A stranger art thou"?  
O Makhfi, walk boldly like Majnun in the valley  
    of grief undismayed,  
Girt round with thy new dedication, the promise  
    of love thou hast made.

</div>

#### IX

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

      <span class="smallcaps">O Saki</span>, do thy task;  
    Into this moon-like goblet pour  
The golden wine that, shining like the sun,  
      From out the dusky flask  
    Comes till my goblet bubbles o’er,  
As from the clouds the dawn when night is done.

      Behold my luckless heart,  
    So broken, so dissolved by pain,  
It even flows in tears between my lashes;  
      And yet how can I part  
    With it, while still to me remain  
Its shards—I wait till it is burnt to ashes.

      I knew long, long ago,  
    Your promises were less than naught,  
I blotted them for ever from my mind.  
      Why was I born to know  
    An age above all others fraught  
With love ungrateful and with fate unkind?

      But grasp thy joy; who knows,  
    Makhfi, what may to thee befall?  
The firm foundations of the earth may shake,  
      The breeze that blows  
    May, if this empty life be all,  
The bubble of our vain existence break.

    <span class="smallcaps">I Ask</span> not from Heaven that it give  
      Fortune or power,  
    I ask but a garden apart,  
      Where for the brief hour  
    That we are appointed to live,  
Of earth the delight that is nearest divine  
          Might be mine—  
To live in the love of the friends of my heart.

    The rapturous nightingale sings,  
      Wooing the rose  
    In the midst of the garden new-born:  
      But only the gardener knows  
    Of the labour that brings  
To the garden its beauty; he toiled in the heat,  
          And his feet  
Have been wounded by many a thorn.

    Immortal is beauty, for, see,  
      Like the sun in his might,  
    It illumines the worlds and all things that  
          are made  
          With the joy of its light;  
    For this be our thanks unto Thee,

</div>

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And for the great teachers vouchsafed in our need  
      To guide and to lead,  
Their presence to be our safe shelter and shade.

    Upon us Thy mercy bestow!  
      Consider how weak,  
    How afflicted we are and how sorrowful;  
      then  
      When we passionate seek  
    For oblivion, and Thou dost know  
How time on our desolate spirit has beat  
      And brought us defeat—  
O save us, nor let us endure it again.

    O happy the seer who knows  
      Good and evil are one,  
    Who has learned how self-poised he may live,  
      Who is shaken by none,  
    To whom spring with its rose  
And autumn are equal:—not him canst thou  
      teach  
      Or, careless one, preach  
To him; thou indeed hast no counsel to give.

    If perilous love doth thee lead,  
      If thou enter his track,  
    In the desert like Majnun thou dwell’st  
      evermore,  
      Thou shalt never look back;  
    Nor even take heed

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

To thy life if thou lose it or keep it, and pain  
      Shalt disdain,  
Nor seek on the limitless ocean of love for a shore.

    O Makhfi, as out of the nest  
      The fledgling birds fall  
    And fluttering, helpless, are caught in the  
      snares,  
      So see after all  
    Thou art caught like the rest,  
For, flying too boldly, thy feeble wings fail,  
      And thou dost bewail  
Thy fate, thus enmeshed in the net of thy cares.

#### XI

<span class="smallcaps">Awake</span>, arise, my soul, for it is
spring;  
    Let the narcissus, with its scent divine,  
Cast its bewitchment, let the Saki bring  
    His idol, for indeed he worships wine.

To the forbidden path turn not aside,  
    And, tyrannous Belovèd, let thine eye  
Look on thy victims trampled in thy pride,  
    Who for a glance from thee would gladly die.

Some pay their worship at the Kaaba shrine,  
    Some pray within the Temple courts apart,  
But, Makhfi, think what secret joy is thine,  
    To bear thine idol ever in thy heart.

#### XII

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="smallcaps">Friends</span> had I, many friends, who shared
with me  
       Days glad and sad,  
But mine they are no more, I am cut free  
      From all I had.

Dust falls within the cup of Kaikobad  
       And King Jamshid,  
Nor reeks the world if they were sad or glad,  
      Or what they did.

Only to-day have we, and through the sand,  
      With feet that tire,  
We march, but never reach the promised land  
      Of heart's desire.

I follow on where Wisdom's feet have led,  
      And firmly hold,  
The while this hard and thorny path I tread,  
      Her garment's fold.

How many hearts, O Love, thy sword hath slain,  
      And yet will slay!  
They bless thee, nor to God will they complain  
      At Judgment Day.

When in the mosque to seek thine idol there

Thy steps fall gently, Makhfi, lest thou scare  
      The birds away.

<span class="smallcaps">Why</span> should I argue that on Sinai  
    Celestial radiance glows?  
I cannot reason; though the world deny,  
    My heart enlightened knows.

My heart is hot within me, yea, has burst  
    In flames of love the while  
So fierce that like a drop to slake my thirst  
    Were all the floods of Nile.

So deep in sin am I—I cannot wend  
    Where holy pilgrims fare  
To Mecca, even if Abraham, God's friend,  
    Should come to lead me there.

I tire of wisdom's kingdom which is mine,  
    I tire of reason's sway:  
Passion of love, O carry me to thine,  
    A hundred miles away.

Lo, when I come unto the water's side  
    The obedient waves retire,  
My flaming heart exultantly shall guide  
    Like Moses' torch of fire.

Though evil days are mine, of joy bereft,  
    With pain that never ends,

    The Friend beyond all friends.

Tell me, O Makhfi, is it I who sin?  
    Is this my sin I bear?  
Is it the body's or the soul's within  
    That lived and sinned elsewhere?

      <span class="smallcaps">O Foolish</span> heart,  
Thy carelessness how can I comprehend?  
Hast thou no strength, no will, to tear apart  
The barrier that divides me from my Friend?

      See how the budding flower,  
Emerging fair from out her torn green dress,  
Is beauteous in the garden for her hour,  
As Yusuf in his youthful loveliness.

      Go, breeze of spring,  
Haste to tell Yakub, blinded by his tears,  
The tidings that shall end his sorrowing  
And lift the darkness from his troubled years.

      Treading love's path so long,  
Under such heavy burdens did I bow,  
At last my chastened heart has grown so strong,  
No task, no pain, can bend my spirit now.

      O fortunate,  
More blessed than Alexander's lot is mine.  
Come to me, O ye thirsty: this my fate—  
To know the giver of celestial wine.

      fly away.  
    The rocks would melt, and into tears would  
      flow,  
Could they but hear the never-ending murmur  
      of my woe;  
    For in the dark foreboding of my heart  
There sounds the warning bell that calls the  
      caravan to start:  
    O Love, I have bewailed for all these years  
Thy tyranny, but none has heard my voice  
      except my tears.  
    Behold how poor I am, but yet so proud,  
I would not sit at Hatim's table with the eager  
      crowd:  
    See, I have watched throughout the lonely  
      night  
Of separation, when there never came my heart's

      of Paradise.  
    Love holds me in these cruel fetters bound,  
My faithfulness to Thee: beside Thy feet, a  
      beaten hound,  
    I crouch and fawn for crumbs of love from Thee.  
O Makhfi, if thy sighs could reach the bosom of

    Even within the cold and lightless deep  
Caught from thy heart a quenchless flame should

    <span class="smallcaps">O Love</span>, I am thy thrall.  
As on the tulip's burning petal glows  
A spot yet more intense, of deeper dye,  
So in my heart a flower of passion blows;  
See the dark stain of its intensity,  
    Deeper than all.

    This is my pride—  
That I the rose of all the world have sought,  
And, still unwearied in the eager quest,  
Fainted nor failed have I, and murmured not;  
Thus is my head exalted o’er the rest,  
    My turban glorified.

    O blessèd pain,  
O precious grief I keep, and sweet unrest,  
Desire that dies not, longing past control!  
My heart is torn to pieces in my breast,  
And for the shining diamond of the soul  
    I pine in vain.

    Behold the light  
That from Thy torch of mercy comes to bless  
The garden of my heart, Beloved One,  
With the white radiance of its loveliness,  
Till my wall's shadow shall outvie the sun,  
    And seem more bright.

The Kaaba courts the true believers tread,  
I dwell outside, nor mix my praise with theirs;  
Yet every fibre of my sacred thread  
More precious is to God than all their prayers—  
    He sees the heart.

    O Makhfi sorrowing,  
Look from the valley of despair and pain;  
The breath of love like morning zephyr blows,  
Pearls from thine eyelids fall like gentle rain  
Upon the garden, summoning the rose,  
    Calling the spring.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> wine of my delight has lost its
taste;  
The earth of my existence turns a waste,  
No wholesome grass grows there, but only weed;  
My flaming spring of life has passed indeed.  
I searched for joy, but never found the end;  
My empty hands, outstretched, can greet no friend;  
And if God's pardon never come to me,  
Then less than withered grass my prayers must be.

But, Makhfi, look with a discerning eye—  
Deeper than thy despair thy bliss may lie;  
Though on the path of love thy feet may tire,  
New strength shall come to thee, and new desire.

As proud as thine arrogant self is this heart in my breast,

Its faithfulness, though it be trampled beneath thy disdain.

This mirror, my heart, is broken against my desire;  
O Heaven, give me not of your pity, nay, rather admire  
        My soul that is proud;  
My head, though I beat it in sorrow, has never been bowed.

Think not that with joy and with ease I pursue my desire;  
With heart that is weary, with footsteps that lag and that tire,  
        I follow my quest,  
To attain through the difficult way to the kingdom of rest.

Yet, Makhfi, look up from thy desolate region of night,

    <span class="smallcaps">Desolate</span> one, O when  
Shalt thou the shining garden see again?  
Keep thou within thee, holy and apart,  
    The garden of thy heart;

    As the long-prisoned bird,  
Forgetting that it ever flew, and heard  
Songs of the wild, and pinions wide unfurled,  
    Makes of the cage its world.

    No fear indeed thou hast,  
O heart within the net of love held fast,  
Of separation's bitter agony—  
    Thy love is one with thee.

    Sadly we wait and tire,  
And sight of the Belovèd Face desire  
In vain, till in our hearts the hope is born  
    Of Resurrection morn.

    O heart, thine be no less  
Than the ascetic Brahman's faithfulness,  
The knotted veins his wasted body bears  
    As sacred thread he wears.

    What is a lover's fate?  
What shall befall to him unfortunate?  
The world shall cry, to please its idle whim,  
    "Crucify him!"

    Why dost thou then complain  
That on thy feet there drags this heavy chain?  
Nay, it befits thee well such weights to wear;  
    Much hast thou learned to bear.

    As, far upon the hills,  
Despairing Ferhad, weary of life's ills,  
Welcomed kind Death, and wept, so for relief  
    Weep thou and salve thy grief!

    And see the thorny waste  
Whereon thy bruisèd feet their pathway traced,  
This wilderness, touched by thy blood that flows,  
    Blooms fragrant as the rose.

    O Love, shall I repine  
The noose of death around my neck to twine  
At thy behest? Nay, if thy glory gain,  
    Proud am I in my pain.

    O Makhfi, if thy fate  
Be that, without the garden, desolate  
Thou dwell—reck not of it; life is a dream,  
    And we, that seem  
To live and move and love, no more at all  
    Than shadows on a wall.

    How strong thou hast become, O moth, how great,

    Think of the memory of their disgrace,

The shame that stings and goads them to repent—

    Within the desert of the world astray,  
    How many weary wanderers lose their way!  
    But Love with beckoning hand appears, to bless,

Leads them through toils and tribulations home.

Wherefor my tears fell down in floods like rain,  
        And as I sighed  
I thought of my desires unsatisfied,  
And memory summoned up with vain regret  
        The garden where we met,  
But meet no more, I tell my heart with pain.

What have I then to do with high estate?

    What is this glamour shining through the gloom?  
My heart's blood, glowing, yields the heavenly light.

O, I have drunk my cup of cherished grief,  
    And love the torment of my wounded heart;  
    As the scars heal I tear their lips apart,  
And in my pain find rapturous relief.

Why should I then permit the winds of care  
    To ruffle thus my soul, as airs of spring  
    Through the Belovèd's tresses wantoning?  
For I have risen to fortune from despair.

O fear not, if within the house of prayer  
    The feeble camphor candle fails and dies;

        Unseen by secular eyes shall I possess.

Who is the man who boasts to be Love's slave,

When I was young I asked, and Love gainsaid;  
    What slips, what wanderings, on Love's road I made,  
        Until I summoned Wisdom to my aid!

The mirror of my heart I burnish bright  
    Until, reflected fair for my delight,  
        The Self's eternal beauty greets my sight.

Like Yaqub blinded by his agony,  
    No face in all the world is aught to me;

Wander like Majnun, where the desert dust

The soul by Love enlightened never fears

Try to ensnare me—like a rose I smile.

The morning breeze that from the garden flies  
Can give no joy, no gladness, to my eyes;  
For, useless breeze, never to me he brings  
The fragrance of Thy garments on his wings.

But here before the garden door I wait;  
Why should I deem myself unfortunate?  
For by Thy holy threshold shall I stay,  
And with my lashes sweep its dust away.

This bird, my heart, is taken in Thy net  
And flutters unavailingly; but yet,  
Thy captive though it be, how canst Thou keep  
Prisoned the sighs that from my bosom leap?

O rare and precious Phœnix of the soul,  
Vainly I sought for thee; beyond control  
My heart has yearned for thee; ever thy wings  
Have hung above my soul's imaginings.

To drink of my blood I am thirsting, to shed it

Intoxication that is more divine.

For I have drunk of a diviner draught,  
Its fragrance ever haunts me, night and day.

    My heart a bird doth seem  
That never joyfully can soar and sing,  
For, shut within its cage of sorrowing,  
It sees the garden only in a dream.

    Shall I not then complain  
When every atom of my body cries  
Against your tyranny, O cruel skies,  
That yield me days so dark and full of pain?

    Grant me, O Fate, this boon,

Torn from its saddle low into the dust  
May be by cruel hands of fate downthrust,  
I know my feet will somehow reach the goal.

How uselessly and long I struggled hard  
    With thee, mine Enemy, nor from the fight  
Aught have I won; my trait’rous heart I guard,

What wonder if the fire within me rise  
    Into a flame outleaping fierce and swift,  
And that the heavy vapour of my sighs  
    Unto the darkened eyes of Heaven should drift!

Think not, though at the feast no more I sit,  
    That I have done with joy: there still remains  
The dream that once was mine—I cherish it,  
    Like wine its memory courses in my veins.

What though within this valley of Despair  
    From sorrow I can never find surcease,  
May I be given, in answer to my prayer,  
    One day at least of rest, one night of peace!

So sad my fate that, though I long and toil

The sweet tormenting flame of my desire  
Is quenched; impatiently I pulled apart  
    The brands and killed the fire.

And never did the blossoms of success  
Within my hope's enchanted garden bloom,  
And my fair beacon-light of happiness  
    Is sunk in gloom.

I vainly stretch imploring hands that long

Though my desire may fail, yet Hope is strong

When on the cup that held the drink divine

The joy of night, the magic of the wine,

I have not wept; I smile in pride instead;  
    Upon my brow are graved no lines of care.

For many years hath sorrow dwelt with me,

My war against despair, it turns to flee—

Blame not the shrinking from thy cup we feel.

Under the angry storms of death my boat of  
    life has foundered deep,  
My house is fallen, round its dust winds of  
    annihilation sweep.

<span class="smallcaps">If</span> from the spot upon my heart the veil  
Should fall, and all the world should know my tale,  
    How would the roses burn with envious light  
        Knowing themselves less bright!

Though all the day the leaping fire of sighs  
May from my fast-consuming heart arise,  
    Winds of mischance so blow and scatter it,  
        My torch is not yet lit.

I leave the world, and to the woods I fly,  
But in the forest hunted still am I;  
    I seek the silence of the lake and hill,  
        But Love pursues me still.

The malady of Love has turned my brain,  
For all my life I have abode with pain;  
    Then why should I from sorrow seek to flee?  
        Sorrow is kin to me.

Here in the dwelling of unhappiness,  
My silent, desolate sorrow I possess;  
    For how can shining love with me remain  
        Within this house of pain?

O Makhfi, from this goblet thou shalt gain  
No exaltation, no surcease from pain;  
    For tears of blood that flow from eyes grown dim  
        Fill it unto the brim.

happiness,  
To still my heart's distress  
The remedy I crave. Why to the crowd  
Should I thus voice aloud  
My sadness, drawing scorn upon my name,  
Telling the world my shame?  
If in the close-hung darkness of the night  
There shine no thread of light,  
What matter? Though no torches flame for me,  
My sorrowing heart can see  
Illumined by the fire of grief it bears.  
Why tangled in the cares  
Of worldly hopes, O heart unsatisfied,  
Restless wilt thou abide,  
Seeking those things that thou shalt never gain?  
Help askest thou in vain  
From useless friends, and far into the skies  
Peace like the Phœnix flies.  
Behold, no herb of sweet content has grown;  
For we have only sown  
In far-off springs the seeds of our disgrace.  
How could we bear to face  
The direful Judgment Day, did we not bring  
Our idol, witnessing

Menacing to the skies.

So weary, Makhfi, are thine eyes with tears,  
Darkened the world appears,  
Nor can they tell, by grief and watching worn,  
The rosebud from the thorn.

Unto Thy faithful ones their heart's desire,  
And visit not with Thy consuming fire  
O’er-burdened souls, too sorrowful to live.

    No longer can I bear  
The separation and the bitter grief;  
Afflicted am I—grant my soul relief!  
Weary and broken—look on my despair!

    O Thou, whose praise we tell,  
Sever the tyrant bonds, give to the slave  
His freedom, save him, Lord, as Thou did’st save  
Yusuf, the Moon of Canaan, from the well!

    My tears fail, for they must;  
The spring that fed their fountains has run dry;  
Give me Thy peace, O Lord; for what am I?  
Only a handful of afflicted dust.

To bloom within my garden of desire,  
For God can call even from flames of fire  
Tulips like torches to arise and burn.

So much of mine own blood I shed,

So difficult the path I tread,

New balm within my heart is borne,  
    New lightnings from my glance arise,  
Why then your anger, and the scorn  
    Flashing from your narcissus eyes?

Out of my heart you reft away  
    The life, my heart from out its place  
You ravished, and I can but pray—  
    O lift the veil that hides your face!

The vision of thy face, for o’er it flows  
The musky darkness of thy waving hair,  
As though a temple-curtain should enclose  
The Kaaba, and our hearts, unsatisfied,  
    Could never see it there.

    O Reason, that can speed  
A runner in the valley of desire,  
We need not strength like thine, for we possess  
A remedy to cure us when we tire;  
The thorns and brambles are the salves we need  
    For pain and weariness.

    Night after endless night  
I sat in lonely grief remembering thee;  
Tears fell into my heart disconsolate.  
How long have I, in striving to be free,  
Broken my bleeding nails, but never quite  
    Untied the knot of fate!

What better could I offer to my guest  
Than wine and music when we revelled long?  
Of all the wines the wine of tears was best,  
One song of sorrow to another led,  
    Making continual song.

    Thou shalt attain success,  
O happy lover, walking on the height;  
Thy shadow greater shall be evermore  
Than King Jamshid's, and plumes and pinions bright  
As hath the Phœnix, shall thy soul possess,  
    Arrogantly to soar.

    By sorrow crucified,  
A true believer lost his life for thee,  
And yet did not attain what I attain:  
This new delight which is bestowed on me  
Even the friends who travelled by my side  
    Could never know nor gain.

    Red with its fount of tears  
Thy rosy face doth like a tulip show,  
To tell what dreams within thy heart arise.  
My tears have washed with their unceasing flow,  
The magic cup wherein the world appears  
    Displayed before mine eyes.

    He never shall be free.

    Behold Love's path—it seems  
So long, O Makhfi; but be strong to tread  
Its toilsome way, and come, nor look behind;  
The temple where thou canst bow down thy head,  
The idol fairer than thy fairest dreams,  
    Thou shalt desire, and find.

      Mocking its glow.

    Down unto death I went,  
The Heavens upon me showered their cruel blows.  
Pity me, O ye Chosen Ones of God!  
O Enemy, when shall I gain repose,  
How long shall I groan under chastisement,  
      Wince ’neath the rod?

    How darkened is my fame!  
Extravagantly have I spent my store,

      I scheme no more.

    The time of spring is past,  
The rose-leaves in the garden drift apart,  
Among the trees the bulbul sings no more.  
How long, O madness, shalt thou hold my heart?  
How long, O exaltation, shalt thou last

Betrayed by love, and left forlorn.

No flower, no nightingale am I,  
So from the garden mournfully  
I go. O breezes, free to stray,  
Back to her garden find your way,

Exiled and driven from thee I pass

The storm sweeps round my house, its ramparts fail,  
Its deep foundations sway before the gale.  
I am a bird, who, flying home to rest,
