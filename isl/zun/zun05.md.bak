### NOTES

*Alexander:* in Persian poetry the type of the most fortunate one, as is
Darius of the most unfortunate.

*Ayub:* Job.

*Diwan:* a Diwan consists of a series of groups of ghazals *(q.v.),* the
first collection rhyming with the first letter of the alphabet, the
second with the second, and so on through the alphabet.

*Ferhad:* a lover famous in Eastern story. He loved Shirin (the sweet
one), who was the wife of King Khosru, about the end of the sixth
century. He was a sculptor, and renowned throughout Persia. The King,
fearing his rivalry, tried to divert his mind from his passion, and
sought to find for him some impossible task. As Shirin had demanded a
"river of milk," he was bidden to clear away the rocks obstructing the
passage of the great mountain of Beysitoun, and to cause the rivers on
the opposite sides of the mountain to join. Ferhad agreed on condition
that, if he were successful, Shirin should be given to him. For years he
laboured, and carved out wonderful caverns, which can be seen to this
day; and the Joui-shir (stream of milk) still flows from the mountain
between Hamadân and Hulwân. Only a few days' work remained to be done,
when the King heard reports that the project was succeeding: he
thereupon sent a messenger to tell Ferhad that Shirin was dead. On
hearing this, Ferhad died, some say by killing himself with his axe,
others say by throwing himself over a precipice.

*Ghazal,* or *gazel:* a form of verse written in a succession of
couplets. The first two lines rhyme, and of the succeeding couplets the
first line is unrhymed, the second rhymes with the first couplet, and so
on, throughout the poem; so that, in the whole poem, all the words which
rhyme, rhyme with one another. When this form of verse consists of only
four lines, it is called a *Rubai.* The

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

length of a ghazal varies, but it is not supposed to be longer than
eighteen couplets. Often the couplets within a ghazal have no apparent
connection, and are complete in themselves. The last couplet usually
contains the name of the poet.

*Hatim,* or *Hatim Tai:* an Arabian chief famed for his generosity: he
never refused a request. He was born in Yemen, in Arabia Felix, in
pre-Musulman times. Some one asked for his head, and he gave it, and so
died.

*Hedjaz:* the greatest desert in Arabia; along its length pass the
principal caravan routes.

*Jamshid:* the type of the magnificent king. He belonged to the mythical
Peshdadian dynasty, and flourished about 800 B.C. He was reputed to be
the builder of Persepolis. His reign was a kind of golden age, when
sickness and death were unknown. The angel Siroush descended from Heaven
to visit him, and left him a robe and an enchanted girdle. He was
gifted, like Moses, with a ray of divine light; so that once, when he
was descending Mount Alborz, the crowd imagined that there were two suns
in the world. His ring and throne had magic powers: when he looked into
his seven-ringed goblet he could see what was passing in all the worlds.
But pride came into his heart, and he forgot God; his subjects revolted
against him and drove him from his kingdom; and he roamed the earth an
outcast for a hundred years. He repented, and was restored, with
undiminished youth, to his kingdom and power.

*Kaaba:* the chief sanctuary of Mecca, the holy city of the Musulmans.
The Kaaba was revered before the time of Muhammad, and was then a rude
stone building; its name came from a word meaning an astralagus, or die,
because of its roughly cubical shape. It has been several times rebuilt,
but the old form has been preserved except in secondary details. Into
its wall is built an ancient black stone, possibly an aerolite, said to
have been given by the angel Gabriel to Abraham.

*Kafir:* an unbeliever; one who is not a Musulman.

*Kaikobad:* a Sultan of the Seljukian dynasty, renowned not only for his
successful wars, but as a great builder of palaces.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

*Kerbela:* the place of the massacre of Hussain, the grandson of the
Prophet, and his children, by the Ommeyyades. It is situated in
Mesopotamia, near the western bank of the Tigris, twenty-eight miles
from the ruins of Babylon. It is a great place of pilgrimage for the
Shiahs, who hold that the spiritual leadership of Islam devolved upon
Ali, the son-in-law of Muhammad, and his descendants. The tomb of
Hussain is in a large mosque; and each year two hundred thousand
pilgrims from all parts of the Musulman world visit it, sometimes
carrying the bones of their ancestors to be buried there. The story of
the death of Hussain is annually read, and sometimes enacted as a
miracle-play, in Shiah communities, with much wailing and sorrow, on the
tenth day of the Mohurrum celebrations.

*Khizr:* the angel-guardian of the spring of immortality.

*Kiblah:* the direction in which Mecca lies, indicated by the mehrab, or
niche, in the wall of a mosque, to which the worshippers turn in prayer.

*Leila* and *Majnun:* the heroine and hero of the celebrated Arabian
love-story told by many poets, of whom the most famous are Jami, Nizami,
and Hatifi. Kaïs was the son of an Arabian chief, but, madly loving
Leila, the daughter of a neighbouring chief, he was called Majnun, or
the mad one. Leila was married to a more powerful suitor, and Majnun
wandered for years in the desert, where he taught the secrets of love to
the birds and beasts.

*Mahmoud:* the praised one, a name of the Prophet.

*Majnun:* the lover of Leila *(q.v.).*

*Makhfi:* the hidden one.

*Mansur:* Mansur al-Hallaj, a Persian saint of the ninth century, who
was crucified at Baghdad for declaring that he was one with God.

*Masiha:* Messiah. Jesus is known in Musulman tradition as the Healer.

*Phœnix:* a fabulous bird of great size and beauty, habitually dwelling
in the Caucasus Mountains, but appearing at very rare intervals. If it
spreads its wings over the head of a man, he becomes a king. It was
supposed to live for seventeen hundred years, and only one existed in
the world at a time.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

*Rustum:* son of Zal, Prince of Seistan: a traditional hero of Persia,
famous for his indomitable strength and bravery. He conquered the Dives,
or evil spirits, and performed other miraculous deeds, comparable to the
labours of Hercules. He is the hero of the *Shah-Nameh* of Firdausi.

*Saki:* the cupbearer.

*Shirin:* the beloved of Ferhad *(q.v.).* The name means "sweet."

*Suleiman:* King Solomon; in Musulman legend lord over angels and
demons, of great wisdom and power, understanding the language, not only
of all men, but of the beasts and birds. His power lay in his possessing
the seal with the name of God.

*Surma:* kohl, or collyriurn, a black powder used in Egypt and the East
for darkening the eyelids and thus giving lustre to the eyes.

*Turks:* the Turcomans from Turkestan, who ravaged Central Asia from
Persia to India and east to China, the Great Wall of which was built as
a protection against them.

*Yaqub:* Jacob, who in Musulman tradition became blind by weeping for
the loss of his son Joseph, who had been sold by his brothers as a slave
into Egypt; he regained his sight when he smelt the garment of his son
which had been brought to him.

*Yusuf:* Joseph, who is regarded as of superhuman loveliness, surrounded
by celestial light, the emblem of divine perfection. He possessed
nine-tenths of the beauty allotted to the whole world.

*Zuleikha:* daughter of Taimus, King of Mauretania. In a dream she saw
and fell in love with the image of Yusuf; she was not told his name, but
only that his abode was Egypt. She went to Memphis to marry Asiz
Potiphar, the Grand Vizier of Pharaoh, imagining her future husband was
the vision of her dream. Yusuf was sold as a slave, and was purchased by
her; but, being warned by the angel Gabriel in the likeness of his
father Jacob, he fled from her. She is represented as always brooding
over her lost happiness.
