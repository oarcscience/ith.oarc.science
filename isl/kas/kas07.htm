<P>THERE is no Good, there is no Bad;<BR>
these be the whims of mortal will:<BR>
What works me weal that call I "good,"<BR>
what harms and hurts I hold as "ill:"</P>
<P>They change with place, they shift with race;<BR>
and, in the veriest span of Time,<BR>
Each Vice has won a Virtue's crown;<BR>
all Good was banned as Sin or Crime:</P>
<P>Like ravelled skeins they cross and twine,<BR>
while this with that connects and blends;<BR>
And only Khizr<SUP>[1]</SUP> his eye shall see<BR>
where one begins, where other ends:</P>
<P>What mortal shall consort with Khizr,<BR>
when Mus&acirc; turned in fear to flee?<BR>
What man foresees the flow'er or fruit<BR>
whom Fate compels to plant the tree?</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Supposed to be the Prophet Elijah.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 36}</P>
<P>For Man's Free-will immortal Law,<BR>
Anagk&ecirc;, Kismet, Des'tiny read<BR>
That was, that is, that aye shall be,<BR>
Star, Fortune, Fate, Urd, Norn or Need.</P>
<P>"Man's nat'ural state is God's design;"<BR>
such is the silly sage's theme;<BR>
"Man's primal Age was Age of Gold;"<BR>
such is the Poet's waking dream:</P>
<P>Delusion, Ign'orance! Long ere Man<BR>
drew upon Earth his earliest breath<BR>
The world was one contin'uous scene<BR>
of anguish, torture, prey and Death;</P>
<P>Where hideous Theria of the wild<BR>
rended their fellows limb by limb;<BR>
Where horrid Saurians of the sea<BR>
in waves of blood were wont to swim:</P>
<P>The "fair young Earth" was only fit<BR>
to spawn her frightful monster-brood;<BR>
Now fiery hot, now icy frore,<BR>
now reeking wet with steamy flood.</P>
<P>{p. 37}</P>
<P>Yon glorious Sun, the greater light,<BR>
the "Bridegroom" of the royal Lyre,<BR>
A flaming, boiling, bursting mine;<BR>
a grim black orb of whirling fire:</P>
<P>That gentle Moon., the lesser light,<BR>
the Lover's lamp, the Swain's delight,<BR>
A ruined world, a globe burnt out,<BR>
a corpse upon the road of night.</P>
<P>What reckt he, say, of Good or Ill<BR>
who in the hill-hole made his lair,<BR>
The blood-fed rav'ening Beast of prey,<BR>
wilder than wildest wolf or bear?</P>
<P>How long in Man's pre-Ad'amite days<BR>
to feed and swill, to sleep and breed,<BR>
Were the Brute-biped's only life,<BR>
a perfect life sans Code or Creed?</P>
<P>His choicest garb a shaggy fell,<BR>
his choicest tool a flake of stone;<BR>
His best of orn'aments tattoo'd skin<BR>
and holes to hang his bits of bone;</P>
<P>{p. 38}</P>
<P>Who fought for female as for food<BR>
when Mays awoke to warm desire;<BR>
And such the Lust that grew to Love<BR>
when Fancy lent a purer fire.</P>
<P>Where <I>then</I> "Th' Eternal nature-law<BR>
by God engraved on human heart?"<BR>
Behold his simiad sconce and own<BR>
the Thing could play no higher part.</P>
<P>Yet, as long ages rolled, he learnt<BR>
from Beaver, Ape and Ant to build<BR>
Shelter for sire and dam and brood,<BR>
from blast and blaze that hurt and killed;</P>
<P>And last came Fire; when scrap of stone<BR>
cast on the flame that lit his den,<BR>
Gave out the shining ore, and made<BR>
the Lord of beasts a Lord of men.</P>
<P>The "moral sense," your Z&acirc;hid-phrase,<BR>
is but the gift of latest years;<BR>
Conscience was born when man had shed<BR>
his fur, his tail, his pointed ears.</P>
<P>{p. 39}</P>
<P>What conscience has the murd'erous Moor,<BR>
who slays his guest with felon blow,<BR>
Save sorrow he can slay no more,<BR>
what prick of pen'itence can he know?</P>
<P>You cry the "Cruelty of Things "<BR>
is myst'ery to your purblind eye,<BR>
Which fixed upon a point in space<BR>
the general project passes by:</P>
<P>For see! the Mammoth went his ways,<BR>
became a mem'ory and a name;<BR>
While the half-reasoner, with the hand<SUP>[1]</SUP><BR>
survives his rank and place to claim.</P>
<P>Earthquake and plague, storm, fight and fray,<BR>
portents and curses man must deem<BR>
Since he regards his self alone,<BR>
nor cares to trace the scope, the scheme;</P>
<P>The Quake that comes in eyelid's beat<BR>
to ruin, level, 'gulf and kill,<BR>
Builds up a world for better use,<BR>
to general Good bends special Ill:</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. The Elephant.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 40}</P>
<P>The dreadest sound man's ear can hear,<BR>
the war and rush of stormy Wind<BR>
Depures the stuff of human life,<BR>
breeds health and strength for human-kind:</P>
<P>What call ye them or Goods or Ills,<BR>
ill-goods, good-ills, a loss, a gain,<BR>
When realms arise and falls a roof;<BR>
a world is won, a man is slain?</P>
<P>And thus the race of Being runs,<BR>
till haply in the time to be<BR>
Earth shifts her pole and Mushtari<SUP>[1]</SUP>-men<BR>
another falling star shall see:</P>
<P>Shall see it fall and fade from sight,<BR>
whence come, where gone no Thought can tell,--<BR>
Drink of yon mirage-stream and chase<BR>
the tinkling of the camel-bell!</P>
