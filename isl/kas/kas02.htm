<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">TO THE READER</H1>
<P>THE Translator has ventured to entitle a "Lay of the Higher Law" the following composition, which aims at being in advance of its time; and he has not feared the danger of collision with such unpleasant forms as the "Higher Culture." The principles which justify the name are as follows:--</P>
<P>The Author asserts that Happiness and Misery are equally divided and distributed in the world.</P>
<P>He makes Self-cultivation, with due regard to others, the sole and sufficient object of human life.</P>
<P>He suggests that the affections, the sympathies, and the "divine gift of Pity" are man's highest enjoyments.</P>
<P>He advocates suspension of judgment, with a proper suspicion of "Facts, the idlest of superstitions."</P>
<P>Finally, although destructive to appearance, he is essentially reconstructive.</P>
<P>For other details concerning the Poem and the Poet, the curious reader is referred to the end of the volume.</P>
