<P>MAN hath no Soul, a state of things,<BR>
a no-thing still, a sound, a word<BR>
Which so begets substantial thing<BR>
that eye shall see what ear hath heard.</P>
<P>Where was his Soul the savage beast<BR>
which in primeval forests strayed,<BR>
What shape had it, what dwelling-place,<BR>
what part in nature's plan it played?</P>
<P>This Soul to ree a riddle made;<BR>
who wants the vain duality?<BR>
Is not myself enough for me?<BR>
what need of "I" within an "I"?</P>
<P>Words, words that gender things!<BR>
The soul is a new-comer on the scene;<BR>
Sufficeth not the breath of Life<BR>
to work the matter-born machine?</P>
<P>{p. 46}</P>
<P>We know the Gen'esis of the Soul;<BR>
we trace the Soul to hour of birth;<BR>
We mark its growth as grew mankind<BR>
to boast himself sole Lord of Earth:</P>
<P>The race of Be'ing from dawn of Life<BR>
in an unbroken course was run;<BR>
What men are pleased to call their Souls<BR>
was in the hog and dog begun:</P>
<P>Life is a ladder infinite-stepped,<BR>
that hides its rungs from human eyes;<BR>
Planted its foot in chaos-gloom,<BR>
its head soars high above the skies:</P>
<P>No break the chain of Being bears;<BR>
all things began in unity;<BR>
And lie the links in regular line<BR>
though haply none the sequence see.</P>
<P>The Ghost, embodied natural Dread<BR>
of dreary death and foul decay,<BR>
Begat the Spirit, Soul and Shade<BR>
with Hades' pale and wan array.</P>
<P>{p. 47}</P>
<P>The Soul required a greater Soul,<BR>
a Soul of Souls, to rule the host;<BR>
Hence spirit-powers and hierarchies,<BR>
all gendered by the savage Ghost.</P>
<P>Not yours, ye Peoples of the Book,<BR>
these fairy visions fair and fond,<BR>
Got by the gods of Khemi-land<SUP>[1]</SUP><BR>
and faring far the seas beyond!</P>
<P>"Th' immortal mind of mortal man!"<BR>
we hear yon loud-lunged Zealot cry;<BR>
Whose mind but means his sum of thought,<BR>
an essence of atomic "I."</P>
<P>Thought is the work of brain and nerve,<BR>
in small-skulled idiot poor and mean;<BR>
In sickness sick, in sleep asleep,<BR>
and dead when Death lets drop the scene.</P>
<P>"Tush!" quoth the Z&acirc;hid, "well we ken<BR>
the teaching of the school abhorr'd<BR>
"That maketh man automaton,<BR>
mind a secretion, soul a word."</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Egypt; Kam, Kem, Khem (hierogl.), in the Demotic Khemi.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 48}</P>
<P>"Of molecules and protoplasm<BR>
you matter-mongers prompt to prate;<BR>
"Of jelly-speck development and apes<BR>
that grew to man's estate."</P>
<P>Vain cavil! all that is hath come<BR>
either by Mir'acle or by Law;--<BR>
Why waste on this your hate and fear,<BR>
why waste on that your love and awe?</P>
<P>Why heap such hatred on a word,<BR>
why "Prototype" to type assign,<BR>
Why upon matter spirit mass?<BR>
Wants an appendix your design?</P>
<P>Is not the highest honour his<BR>
who from the worst hath drawn the best;<BR>
May not your Maker make the world<BR>
from matter, an it suit His hest?</P>
<P>Nay more, the sordider the stuff<BR>
the cunninger the workman's hand:<BR>
Cease, then, your own Almighty Power<BR>
to bind, to bound, to understand.</P>
<P>{p. 49}</P>
<P>"Reason and Instinct!" How we love<BR>
to play with words that please our pride;<BR>
Our noble race's mean descent<BR>
by false forged titles seek to hide</P>
<P>For "gift divine" I bid you read<BR>
the better work of higher brain,<BR>
From Instinct differing in degree<BR>
as golden mine from leaden vein.</P>
<P>Reason is Life's sole arbiter,<BR>
the magic Laby'rinth's single clue:<BR>
Worlds lie above, beyond its ken;<BR>
what crosses it can ne'er be true.</P>
<P>"Fools rush where Angels fear to tread!"<BR>
Angels and Fools have equal claim<BR>
To do what Nature bids them do,<BR>
sans hope of praise, sans fear of blame!</P>
<P>{p. 50}</P>
