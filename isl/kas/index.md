# THE KASÎDAH

#### OF

## HÂJÎ ABDÛ EL-YEZDÎ

## by Sir Richard Burton

#### \[1880\]

This was written by Sir Richard Burton under the pseudonym of Hâjî Abdû
El-Yezdî after his return from Mecca in 1854. Observant readers will
note that the Kasîdah contains many references to 19th Century
scientific and philosophical concepts, most notably the evolution of
species. Nonetheless, it is a Sufi text to the core, and one of the few
instances of Burton writing in the first person about his belief system,
albeit under the cloak of pseudonymity. According to the Oxford English
Dictionary, a Kasidah is a classical Arabic or Persian panegyric, which
must begin with a reference to a forsaken campground, followed by a
lament, and a prayer to ones comrades to halt while the memory of the
departed dwellers is invoked. The same rhyme has to run through the
entire composition, not matter how long the poem is.
