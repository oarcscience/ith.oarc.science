<P>THERE is no Heav'en, there is no Hell;<BR>
these be the dreams of baby minds;<BR>
Tools of the wily Fetisheer,<BR>
to 'fright the fools his cunning blinds.</P>
<P>Learn from the mighty Spi'rits of old<BR>
to set thy foot on Heav'en and Hell;<BR>
In Life to find thy hell and heav'en<BR>
as thou abuse or use it well.</P>
<P>So deemed the doughty Jew who dared<BR>
by studied silence low to lay<BR>
Orcus and Hades, lands of shades,<BR>
the gloomy night of human day.</P>
<P>Hard to the heart is final death:<BR>
fain would an <I>Ens</I> not end in <I>Nil</I>;<BR>
Love made the senti'ment kindly good:<BR>
the Priest perverted all to ill.</P>
<P>{p. 51}</P>
<P>While Reason sternly bids us die,<BR>
Love longs for life beyond the grave:<BR>
Our hearts, affections, hopes and fears<BR>
for life-to-be shall ever crave.</P>
<P>Hence came the despot's darling dream,<BR>
a Church to rule and sway the State;<BR>
Hence sprang the train of countless griefs<BR>
in priestly sway and rule innate.</P>
<P>For future Life who dares reply?<BR>
No witness at the bar have we;<BR>
Save what the brother Potsherd tells,--<BR>
old tales and novel jugglery.</P>
<P>Who e'er return'd to teach the Truth.,<BR>
the things of Heaven and Hell to limn?<BR>
And all we hear is only fit<BR>
for grandam-talk and nursery-hymn.</P>
<P>"Have mercy, man!" the Z&acirc;hid cries,<BR>
"of our best visions rob us not!<BR>
"Mankind a future life must have<BR>
to balance life's unequal lot."</P>
<P>{p. 52}</P>
<P>"Nay," quoth the Magian, "'tis not so;<BR>
I draw my wine for one and all,<BR>
"A cup for this, a score for that,<BR>
e'en as his measure's great or small:</P>
<P>"Who drinks one bowl hath scant delight;<BR>
to poorest passion he was born;<BR>
"Who drains the score must e'er expect<BR>
to rue the headache of the morn."</P>
<P>Safely he jogs along the way<BR>
which 'Golden Mean' the sages call;<BR>
Who scales the brow of frowning Alp<BR>
must face full many a slip and fall.</P>
<P>Here &egrave;xtremes meet, anointed Kings<BR>
whose crown&egrave;d heads uneasy lie,<BR>
Whose cup of joy contains no more<BR>
than tramps that on the dunghill die.</P>
<P>To fate-doomed Sinner born and bred<BR>
for dangling from the gallows-tree;<BR>
To Saint who spends his holy days<BR>
in rapt'urous hope his God to see;</P>
<P>{p. 53}</P>
<P>To all that breathe our upper air<BR>
the hands of Dest'iny ever deal,<BR>
In fixed and equal parts, their shares<BR>
of joy and sorrow, woe and weal.</P>
<P>How comes it, then, our span of days<BR>
in hunting wealth and fame we spend<BR>
Why strive we (and all humans strive)<BR>
for vain and visionary end?</P>
<P>Reply: mankind obeys a law<BR>
that bids him labour, struggle, strain;<BR>
The Sage well knowing its unworth,<BR>
the Fool a-dreaming foolish gain.</P>
<P>And who, mid e'en the Fools, but feels<BR>
that half the joy is in the race<BR>
For wealth and fame and place, nor sighs<BR>
when comes success to crown the chase?</P>
<P>Again: in Hind, Ch&icirc;n, Franguest&acirc;n<BR>
that accident of birth befell.<BR>
Without our choice, our will, our voice:<BR>
Faith is an accident as well.</P>
<P>{p. 54}</P>
<P>What to the Hindu saith the Frank:<BR>
"Denier of the Laws divine!<BR>
"However godly-good thy Life,<BR>
Hell is the home for thee and thine."</P>
<P>"Go strain the draught before 'tis drunk,<BR>
and learn that breathing every breath,<BR>
"With every step, with every gest,<BR>
something of life thou do'est to death."</P>
<P>Replies the Hindu: "Wend thy way<BR>
for foul and foolish Mlenchhas fit;<BR>
"Your Pariah-par'adise woo and win;<BR>
at such dog-Heav'en I laugh and spit.</P>
<P>"Cannibals of the Holy Cow!<BR>
who make your rav'ening maws the grave<BR>
"Of Things with self-same right to live;--<BR>
what Fiend the filthy license gave?"</P>
<P>What to the Moslem cries the Frank?<BR>
"A polygamic Theist thou!<BR>
From an imposter-Prophet turn;<BR>
Thy stubborn head to Jesus bow."</P>
<P>{p. 55}</P>
<P>Rejoins the Moslem: "Allah's one<BR>
tho' with four Moslemahs I wive,<BR>
"One-wife-men ye and (damn&egrave;d race!)<BR>
you split your God to Three and Five."</P>
<P>The Buddhist to Confucius thus:<BR>
"Like dogs ye live, like dogs ye die;<BR>
"Content ye rest with wretched earth;<BR>
God, judgment, Hell ye fain defy."</P>
<P>Retorts the Tartar: "Shall I lend<BR>
mine only ready-money 'now,'<BR>
"For vain usurious 'Then' like thine,<BR>
avaunt, a triple idiot Thou!"</P>
<P>With this poor life, with this mean world<BR>
I fain complete what in me lies;<BR>
"I strive to perfect this my me;<BR>
my sole ambition's to be wise."</P>
<P>When doctors differ who decides<BR>
amid the milliard-beaded throng?<BR>
Who save the madman dares to cry:<BR>
"'Tis I am right, you all are wrong?"</P>
<P>{p. 56}</P>
<P>"You all are right, you all are wrong,"<BR>
we hear the careless Soofi say,<BR>
"For each believes his glimm'ering lamp<BR>
to be the gorgeous light of day."</P>
<P>"<I>Thy</I> faith why false, <I>my</I> faith why true?<BR>
'tis all the work of Thine and Mine,<BR>
"The fond and foolish love of self<BR>
that makes the Mine excel the Thine."</P>
<P>Cease then to mumble rotten bones;<BR>
and strive to clothe with flesh and blood<BR>
The skel'eton; and to shape a Form<BR>
that all shall hail as fair and good.</P>
<P>"For gen'erous youth," an Arab saith,<BR>
"Jahim's<SUP>[1]</SUP> the only genial state;<BR>
"Give us the fire but not the shame<BR>
with the sad, sorry blest to mate."</P>
<P>And if your Heav'en and Hell be true,<BR>
and Fate that forced me to be born<BR>
Force me to Heav'en or Hell--I go,<BR>
and hold Fate's insolence in scorn.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>[1. Jehannum, Gehenna, Hell.]</P>
</FONT><P>{p. 57}</P>
<P>I want not this, I want not that,<BR>
already sick of Me and Thee;<BR>
And if we're both transform'd and changed,<BR>
what then becomes of Thee and Me?</P>
<P>Enough to think such things may be:<BR>
to say they are not or they are<BR>
Were folly: leave -them all to Fate,<BR>
nor wage on shadows useless war.</P>
<P>Do what thy manhood bids thee do,<BR>
from none but self expect applause;<BR>
He noblest lives and noblest dies<BR>
who makes and keeps his self-made laws.</P>
<P>All other Life is living Death,<BR>
a world where none but Phantoms dwell,<BR>
A breath, a wind, a sound, a voice,<BR>
a tinkling of the camel-bell.</P>
<P>{p. 58}</P>
