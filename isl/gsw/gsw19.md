<span class="smallcaps">Upon</span> returning to our lodging, I was
visited by *Mirza* Hasan Ali, a relative of mine, who greeted me with
the utmost respect and warmth. I would mention that he himself is a poet
of no mean qualities, and also a learned historian; but, alas! to-day,
in Iran, His Majesty is too much busied with the affairs not only of his
own empire but also of every corner of the world, where his royal
representatives reside, to be able to reward his poets. Indeed, when I
tell you that *Mirza* Hasan Ali scarcely ever writes poetry, but is
occupied in trying to make money out of a coal mine, where many men have
already lost their fortunes, you will understand that the times have
clashed together.

I was much pleased, however, to make the acquaintance of a kinsman, whom
I had heard of

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span> <span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

for many years, and who I now learned had the peculiarity of never
finishing the house he lived in, for fear that, once the house was
completed, he would die.

But I must not forget that my readers are anxious for a description of
some other of the magnificent buildings of the Sacred Threshold, and so
I will ask them to accompany me to the "New Court." This splendid
edifice was commenced by Fath Ali Shah of the Kajar dynasty, and was
enriched by Nasir-u-Din Shah, may Allah pardon him!

The portico leading to the Shrine is termed the "Nasiri Golden Porch" in
honour of the great Shah, Nasir-u-Din, who paved it with beautiful
marble, and covered the walls with golden tiles which dazzle the eyes.

After the Shrine there is nothing in Meshed which can be compared with
the mosque of Gauhar Shad *Aga*, who was, as has been already mentioned,
the wife of Shah Rukh, son of dread Amir Timur, Lord of the Conjunction
of the Planets.

In the centre of the noble quadrangle is the unroofed mosque of the "Old
Woman." The story runs that when Gauhar Shad *Aga*, may Allah forgive
her, wished to purchase the land in order to erect the mosque thereon,
an old woman refused to sell one plot, but demanded

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

that on it should be built a separate mosque bearing her name. So great
was the love of justice of the Princess that her petition was agreed to,
and thereby two women have obtained undying fame, the one for her piety
and the other for her justice.

Now, O ye wise men of Europe, what is better than justice, and what
monarchs can the world produce to compare with Faridun, of whom the poet
wrote:

Faridun the noble was not an angel;  
  He was not formed of musk and ambergris.  
From justice and generosity he obtained his reputation.  
  Do thou justice and show generosity, thou art Faridun.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This same monarch
bequeathed the following advice to his descendants as a priceless
legacy:

Deem every day in thy life as a leaf in thy history;  
Be careful, therefore, that nothing be written in it unworthy of
posterity.

A nobler maxim than this no one has heard. But Faridun was not the only
monarch of Iran renowned for justice throughout the Seven Climates. For
it is narrated that Omar, who was subsequently second Caliph, and
Muavia, who was the first monarch of the Omayyad dynasty, visited
Madain, then the capital of Iran, during the reign of Noshirwan. One of
the King's sons wished to purchase a mare belonging to them, but they
refused to sell it at any price,

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span id="img_26300"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![THE MOSQUE OF

</span>

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span> <span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

and, ultimately, it was forcibly taken from them by the servants of the
prince.

The strangers complained to Noshirwan, who inquired into the case, and
finding their complaint to be well founded, the mare was returned to
them with rich gifts from the king.

Upon leaving the city on their return journey they saw the corpse of a
quartered man on the gate; and asking for what crime this sentence had
been passed, were informed that the corpse was that of one of the King's
sons who had taken a mare by force from some strangers.

Many years passed, the kingdom of Persia had fallen into the hands of
the Arabs, and Muavia was Governor of Syria. There he behaved in a
tyrannical manner, and seized some property unjustly. Complaint was made
to Omar, who was now the Caliph, and he, finding that the charge was
true, wrote to Muavia a letter of one word, and that word was "mare."

The wretched man was preaching the Friday sermon in the mosque of
Damascus when the epistle was delivered, and on reading it he fainted
and nearly died from fear; and when he recovered consciousness he
immediately restored tenfold what he had taken by force. Thus was the
justice of Noshirwan a shining light to the Seven Climates, and,
moreover, there is a tradition to the effect that the Prophet, on him

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

be Peace, considered that his own birth during the reign of so just a
monarch was auspicious.

To resume, there are four porches in the mosque of Gauhar Shad *Aga*,
which are considered to be unsurpassed for elegance of construction, for
loftiness, and for perfection of proportion. The tilework, too, is so
beautiful that how can I represent it?

In the *Aiwan-i-Maksura*, above which rises the superb blue dome, stands
an exquisitely carved wooden pulpit of especial sanctity, as, when the
Day of Judgment is at hand, the twelfth *Imam* will descend on to it.
May Allah hasten his advent; and may He grant that we may ever keep the
Day of Judgment in remembrance!

But before quitting the Sacred Threshold I would refer to Allah Verdi
Khan, who is honoured by being buried in a building adjoining the
*haram*. This individual was a noted general of Shah Abbas, and ordered
his tomb to be built during his lifetime. When it was completed the
architect came to him, settled the account, and then said, "The dome is
completed and only awaits Your Excellency's august body." The great
noble considered this to be a message from Allah the Omnipotent, and
four days after hearing it he expired.

I will now refer briefly to the famous colleges

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

of Meshed, sixteen in number. In each of them students are provided by
the legacies of pious men, not only with spiritual and intellectual
knowledge, but even with food and, in some cases, with clothing.

In these colleges there are twelve hundred students, not only from every
province of Persia, but also from distant India and still more distant
Tibet.

Each student attends classes beginning with syntax and ending with
jurisprudence, theology, and philosophy. This course, which is termed
"superficial," lasts nine years, after which the student proceeds to
Najaf, where for a second period of similar length he attends the
lectures of the famous doctors of law.

Finally, when considered sufficiently instructed, he receives a written
certificate, sealed by the principal doctors of law, to the effect that
he has acquired learning equal to their own, and is a fit interpreter of
the law, in which it is no longer lawful for him to follow the opinion
of another. He then returns to his home, where he speedily acquires a
good practice.

Among these colleges is one situated in the "Upper Avenue," which was
endowed by a certain Fazil Khan, who acquired his wealth in India. One
of the conditions he left in the deed of endowment was that neither
Indians,

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mazanderanis, nor
Arabs were to be admitted. Indians because they were miserly,
Mazanderanis because they were quarrelsome, and Arabs because they were
dirty and unmannerly.

It is stated that an Arab applied for admittance, and upon learning the
reason why he was excluded, exclaimed, "May Allah bless thy father, O
Fazil *Khan*, for thou hast spoken the truth!"

Yet another college was endowed by a Persian, who gained his wealth in a
remarkable manner. One day a rich merchant asked him whether he was
willing to work at a place to which he would be conducted blindfold.
Being a fearless Kermani and very poor he agreed, and was led through
many streets to a courtyard where the bandage was removed, and he was
ordered to dig a hole and bury gold coins and jewellery. This he did for
several days, and being searched before he left, he saw no chance of
bettering his condition.

However, one day he saw a cat, which he killed and ripped open. He then
sewed up some money and jewels inside it and threw it over the wall.
After this, when his work was done, he wandered about until he found the
cat, and not only secured the money hidden in its body, but also learned
the position of the house.

Its owner shortly afterwards died, and the astute Kermani bought his
house with the gold

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

sewn up inside the cat, and as the merchant had never revealed his
secret to any one he became his heir, and in turn, when dying,
bequeathed his money for the pious task of founding and maintaining a
college. May Allah pardon him!

More than one of these colleges, these seats of the deepest learning,
were visited by me, and when I saw the eager students gathered round
wise, white-bearded professors, and listened to the wisdom that flowed
like honey from those learned lips, I thanked Allah that he had ordained
Meshed to be a "Lamp of Guidance."

 

After visiting all the centres of sacred interest, *Mirza* Hasan Ali
agreed one day to guide me to the tomb of Firdausi at Tus, as it would
not have been befitting for me to leave Khorasan without first honouring
myself by such a visit.

Tus is situated some four *farsakhs* from Meshed by the Kashaf River,
and, even from a long way off, its ancient walls and towers were most
conspicuous. Approaching the ancient city we descended to the banks of
the river, and crossed it by the famous bridge which is connected with
the great poet.

As I have previously mentioned, Sultan Mahmud treated Firdausi with
great miserliness; but, some years later, he was riding with his Vizier,
and the question turned on whether a

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

certain chief would submit or have to be attacked. The Vizier, by way of
answer, quoted:

And should the reply with my wish not accord,  
Then Afrasiab's field, and the mace, and the sword!

"Whose verse was that?" inquired the monarch, and, on learning that it
was by Firdausi, he repented of his lack of generosity, and sent him a
rich gift carried by the royal camels, together with an expression of
his regret. But, as the camels entered the city, they met the bier on
which Firdausi was being borne to his tomb!

Passing through the ruined walls we hastened on, and at last *Mirza*
Hasan Ali pointed me out the spot where the poet lies. But, alas for the
honour of us Iranis! there was no dome to mark where Firdausi, the glory
of Iran, was buried, and not even a tombstone.

Allah knows how I wept for the disgrace which I, as a poet, felt most
keenly, and how I repeated his poems throughout the heat of the day, and
more especially the lines:

All had been dead for ages past;  
But were restored to life by my poetry:  
I, like Jesus, have infused life  
Into all of them with my verse.  
Inhabited buildings will be ruined  
By rain and the revolution of the Sun:  
I, however, with my poetry have reared a noble edifice  
That neither wind nor rain can harm. <span id="page_271">p. 271</span>  
This poem will pass through many cycles:  
And all those who possess wisdom will read it.  
I have undergone many hardships during thirty years,  
But have brought Persia back to life with my Persian <span
id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_68) poetry.

At length, wearied out by the journey and my emotions, I fell asleep,
and, in a dream, I beheld Firdausi writing his poem. Looking more
closely, I saw that the poet was engaged in writing the famous story of
the sons of Faridun.

It is related that when that illustrious monarch became old he gave his
eldest son, Salm, the west, and Turan or Tartary to Tur; but on his
youngest, Erij by name, he bestowed Iran. The two elder brothers
threatened to revolt on hearing that Iran, their home and the seat of
royalty, was to pass to the youngest member of the family, and Faridun
was distraught at thus ending his glorious reign.

However, Erij, who was the noble son of a noble sire, heard what was the
cause of his aged father's grief, and, visiting his brothers, offered to
resign his crown rather than that there should be civil war. But Salm
and Tur, whose mother was a daughter of Zohak, the accursed, conspired
together and decided to put Erij to death.

While I gazed I saw that an angel was

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

guiding Firdausi's pen, as he wrote the appeal of Erij to his brothers:

Will ye ever let it be recorded  
That ye, possessing life, deprive others of that blessing?  
Pain not the ant that drags the grain along the ground;  
It has life, and life is sweet and pleasant to all who possess it.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Scarcely had the
last word been written than I awoke and behold it was a dream, but I
fell down prostrate on the ground and thanked Allah the Omnipotent that
on me, a humble poet of modern Iran, such a signal blessing had been
conferred.

 

My last visit to the Shrine was at night, and, upon the whole, I was
pleased that it was lighted with the electric light, which is, at any
rate, free from objectionable matters, foreign candles being, they say,
made of even the fat of the unclean animal. <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_69)

But yet I yearned to be back in the days of *Shah* Abbas, who, after
having performed the entire journey from Isfahan on foot, undertook the
menial task of trimming the locally made candles, thousands of which
illuminated the Shrine. On this occasion His Majesty was attended by
*Shaykh* Behai, who composed the following quatrain:—

The angels from the high heavens gather like moths  
O’er the candles lighted in this Paradise-like tomb:

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span> <span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

O trimmer, manipulate the scissors with care,  
Or else thou mayest clip the wings of Gabriel.

I have not, O inhabitants of Europe, described to you the fort with its
palaces, where a princely Governor-General dispenses justice and
maintains such order that Khorasan is as tranquil as Kerman; nor have I
described in detail the other buildings which adjoin the Shrine, for any
allusion to them would, as we say, be like taking the foot of an ant
into the presence of Solomon.

We had now completed our pilgrimage and had visited everything which it
was right and proper to visit. We had even spent some days in the cool
country of Kuhpaia, where the beautiful gardens and the running streams
surpass description. In short, there was no reason for remaining any
longer.

And yearning to return to Kerman took such a hold upon Ali *Khan* that
he kept repeating:

On Friday night I started from Kerman;  
I did wrong as I turned my back on my friend.

Indeed, we were all equally affected, and I quoted the verses which
Rudagi sang at Herat to the home-sick *Amir* Nasr ibn Ahmad:

The sands of Oxus, toilsome though they be,  
Beneath my feet were soft as silk to me.  
Glad at the friend's return, the Oxus deep  
Up to our girths in laughing waves shall leap.  
Long live Bokhara! Be thou of good cheer!  
Joyous towards thee hasteth our Amir! <span id="page_276">p.
276</span>  
The Moon's the Prince, Bokhara is the sky,  
O sky, the Moon will light thee by-and-by!  
Bokhara is the mead, the Cypress he,  
Receive, at last, O mead, the Cypress tree!

No poem, perhaps, ever produced such sudden effect, as the Amir leaped
on to the saddled horse, which was always kept ready for an emergency,
without even donning his boots, and left his astonished courtiers to
follow as best they might.

We too felt that the sands of the Lut would be softer than silk, but not
in the least toilsome to pilgrims returning home from Sacred Meshed, and
soon we began to make preparations for our return.

 

We had started on the pilgrimage in the spring time, and we left Meshed,
on our return journey, at the end of the "Forty days of Heat"; and,
*Alhamdulillah!* two months later we reached Baghin, which is but one
stage from Kerman.

There we were met by many of our nearest relations and oldest friends,
and Rustam Beg brought the Arab horse with the golden trappings for me
to ride.

The next day, at about a, *farsakh* out we were met by half the city,
who congratulated us so warmly and so lovingly, that, bursting into
tears, I said, "Allah is my witness that Shah

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Namat Ullah wrote
the truth when he composed the lines that "We are men of heart."

Escorted by relations and friends our joyous party entered the city and
passed through the bazaars, where all the shopkeepers rose up in our
honour, and so to my house. Now my house is by no means small, but when
I represent that there was no room for people to stand even in the
courtyard, I have explained the matter.

At last my relations and friends had wished me "May Allah protect thee,"
and, tired out with the long journey and my reception upon returning
home, I retired to rest. But before sleep like that of the Seven
Sleepers overtook me, a voice from The Unknown reached my ears, a voice
of such mellifluous sweetness that its very tones brought repose to my
mind. Thrice it thrilled me with the words, "Thy pilgrimage is
accepted," and by the grace of the *Imam*, to him be praise, peace,
perfect and infinite, filled my soul.
