### CHAPTER VI

#### KERMAN, THE HEART OF THE WORLD

Although we stand abashed in the presence of the noble,  
It matters not, since we have drawn nourishment from this earth and
water;  
On the face of the earth, there is no place like Kerman;  
Kerman is the heart of the world, and we are men of heart.  
                                              <span
class="smallcaps">Shah Namat Ullah</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> origin of Kerman is famous throughout
the Seven Climates, if only on account of the world-renowned legend
connected with it, which I will here repeat.

In the days of Ardeshir, son of Babek, who lived many centuries before
our Prophet, on him and on his descendants be peace, a maiden was
spinning with her companions in a garden when she picked up an apple,
within which she found a *kerm* or worm.

She, half in jest, vowed that if she completed her allotted task before
her companions, she would cherish the worm and feed it daily. Almost at
once her spinning was completed, and

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

from that day her father's family increased in prosperity until they
conquered the province, which was thenceforward known by its name of
Kerman or the "Worm Province."

Ardeshir, monarch of Iran, suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of
Haftan Bokht, the father of the girl, until he realised that so long as
the Worm was alive he was powerless.

Consequently he resolved on a daring stratagem, and, disguising himself
as a merchant prince, he presented himself before Haftan Bokht and said,
that as he owed all his success in trade to the good fortune of the
Worm, he requested the honour of feeding it for three days. This
petition was readily granted, and as Firdausi, the greatest epic poet of
all the cycles of time, writes:

When their souls were deep steeped in the wine-cup;  
Forth fared the Prince with his hosts of the hamlet,  
Brought with him copper and brazen cauldron,  
Kindled a flaming fire in the white daylight.  
So to the Worm at its meal-time was measured  
In place of milk and rice much molten metal.  
Unto its trench he brought that liquid copper;  
Soft from the trench its head the Worm upraised.  
Then they beheld its tongue, like brazen cymbal,  
Thrust forth to take its food as was its custom.  
Into its open jaws that molten metal  
Poured he, while, in the trench, helpless the Worm writhed;  
Crashed from its throat the sound of fierce explosion,  
Such that the trench and whole fort fell a-quaking.  
Swift as the wind Ardeshir and his comrades <span id="page_85">p.
85</span>  
Hastened with drawn swords, arrows, and maces.  
Of the Worm's warders, wrapped in their wine-sleep,  
Not one escaped alive from their fierce onslaught.  
Then from the Castle-keep raised he the smoke-wreaths  
Which his success should tell to his captains.  
Hasting to Shahr-gir swift came the sentry,  
Crying, "King Ardeshir his task hath finished!"  
Quickly the captain then came with his squadrons,  
Leading his mail-clad men unto the King's aid.

I think, O wise men of the Seven Climates, that you will agree that the
origin of Kerman is out of the common, and that the city founded by
Ardeshir is no ordinary city. He it was who constructed the great ditch
and also the two awesome forts, reaching to the clouds, and the stronger
and higher of these great fortresses still bears his name; the other is
known as the "Virgin's Fort," and has never been polluted by a
conqueror's triumph.

But to-day, thanks to the might of the Kajar dynasty, these forts are in
ruins, as peace reigns everywhere, and the city of Kerman, which bears
the illustrious title of "Abode of Safety," stretches far and wide at
their feet. Not that there are no walls round the city, that would be
folly; but Kerman is built on a perfect plan and has great squares,
peerless mosques, and superb colleges, that make it the envy of all
other cities in Persia.

The palace, too, is so magnificent that travellers consider its "Hall of
Audience" to

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

be a rival to that at the capital, but Allah knows if this be true.

No account, however, of the residence of the Governor-General would be
complete without a reference to the Drum House. From the days of
Jamshid, <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) who built the palaces still
called by

his name near Shiraz, every great city has enjoyed the privilege of
hearing music, which is played from a gateway to usher in the rising sun
and to play out the setting sun. Indeed, it is evident that this music
is of great antiquity. The instruments consist of kettledrums of a large
size, pipes, and long trumpets quite six

feet long. Whenever I hear the music I feel proud that I am an Irani,
whose history goes back to the days when the sun was worshipped; and
even Farangis acknowledge that they have never heard any music like that
of the Drum House.

Our city, compared to which Shiraz is little more than a village, is
surrounded by lovely gardens, many of which are owned by the
Gabrs, <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md)

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

who, although despised by all Mussulmans, are yet the best gardeners in
Persia; and, after all, they are our own stock and they swear that
*Hazrat* Ibrahim was their Prophet.

Kerman is famous for its shawls, which rival those of Kashmir, and for
its carpets, which are unrivalled in the world. They say that it is the
wonderful climate of the province which produces wool of such exquisite
fineness; and yet, without the hereditary skill of the Kermanis, of what
use would these advantages prove? Indeed, kings prize the output of the
Kerman looms; and whenever a robe of honour is bestowed by the Shah, may
Allah protect him! it is always a Kerman shawl of exquisite beauty and
fineness. Indeed, the shawls of Kashmir, which also are very fine, are
partly manufactured from Kerman wool, and so, in praising them, I also
laud Kerman.

Not that the province is without natural products, as, among many other
things which grow wild for any one to collect, are the delicious caraway
seeds. Indeed, so famous are they that "To take caraway seeds to Kerman"
has become a proverb.

The inhabitants of my city are noted for their hospitality, and there
were frequent parties in the gardens with their red roses, leafy glades,
and running streams; and we spent the summer

day in reciting verses or discussing the history of glorious Iran. In
the winter, too, the long evenings were spent most pleasantly, as
Persians, and especially the Kermanis, have so keen a wit that it is
impossible to tire of listening to its sallies. In short, I thanked
Allah that I had become an inhabitant of such a famous city, where my
learning and wit were so fully appreciated.

Owing to the fact that the Governor-General, the Vakil-ul-Mulk, may
Allah keep cool his grave! had always considered my father as one of his
own family, his son, who had now succeeded him, continued to treat me
with equal kindness, and I gradually became his chief courtier, and so
fond was he of history and poetry that, when he went into the mountains
during the "Forty days of Heat," he always took me in his service; and
thus my position and wealth were increased. Indeed, I soon began to be
employed on matters of importance, as will be shown later on.

I have not hitherto mentioned that in Kerman there lived an English
doctor who, when he first came, was looked upon as a stranger; but,
Allah knows, in surgery the English surpass even our best *hakims*, and,
as Allah the Omnipotent used the *Sahib* as a medium to restore the
sight of my uncle, who had a cataract in his left eye, I became a great

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

friend of his; and indeed it was he who suggested that the inhabitants
of London and of the New World would like to read the story which is now
being written.

In addition to a hospital, a school was opened by the English, and to it
a few of the sons of the *Khans* were sent. The Vakil-ul-Mulk, whose
grandfather had been the official entertainer of Sir John Malcolm, when
that illustrious Englishman was appointed ambassador at the foot of the
throne of Fath Ali Shah, was most kind to the English; and perhaps it is
not known that once when a high official asked him to name what gift the
British Government should offer him, he replied that he wished a Persian
translation of the ambassador's *History of Persia* to be made and
presented to him.

I always consider that this action showed how noble was the character of
the Vakil-ul-Mulk, and I shall never forget his reply to his Vizier who
had represented that, in his opinion, a hundred rifles would have been a
more useful gift. The Vakil-ul-Mulk simply replied, "Listen what
*Shaykh* Sadi says:

"Sons of Adam from learning will find perfection,  
 Not from dignity, and rank, and wealth, and property;  
 Like a taper one must melt in pursuit of learning,  
 Since without learning one cannot know God."

Now I do not want it thought that I who am,

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Allah be praised,
a pious Mussulman, am a lover of European ways. Far from it, I am no
fool, and what I know, I know.

Once, our Governor-General sent one of his sons to Europe with plenty of
money, and with instructions to study history, law, geography, all
sciences and languages, and above all, Parliament. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) Well, Fazal Ullah Khan spent several years
and much money in London, and wrote to his father such accounts of his
learning and of the attentions paid to him by its Viziers, who,
according to him, vied with one another in honouring him, that the
Governor-General was transported with delight, and frequently exclaimed
in Durbar that, without the slightest doubt, Fazal Ullah Khan would, one
day, be Grand Vizier of Persia, or, if not that, he would certainly
become Vizier for Foreign Affairs.

At length Fazal Ullah Khan wrote to his father that he was returning to
his service, and His Excellency, who was camping in the hills during the
"Forty days of Heat," gave orders for him to be met with the highest
honours by all his servants, of whom I was one of the chief.

The reception party consisted of three hundred sowars under a general,
but with the

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Governor's chief
officer in supreme charge. There were also twenty mounted servants
leading superb horses with collars of gold round their necks and
gorgeous Resht saddle-cloths; and the Governor's favourite horse was
sent for Fazal Ullah Khan to ride upon. In truth, had he been a prince
more honour would not have been shown him.

Near the camp, ten servants with silver maces and sixty *farrashes* led
the future Vizier to where His Excellency awaited him alone. Fazal Ullah
Khan flung himself off his horse and wished to do obeisance to his
father; but the latter, kissing him on the mouth, led him by the hand to
a tent which they entered alone.

After a short silence His Excellency said, "My son, during the course of
your many years of travel, tell me what is the most extraordinary thing
thou hast observed." "Lord of my life," was the reply, "may I be thy
ransom; but, in London, even the little boys spoke the English tongue."

The Governor made no reply, but rose and left the tent. He was
immediately surrounded by the nobles of the province, who expressed
hopes that he was satisfied with his son. The only reply I heard was,
"My money has been burnt."

That night this matter and nothing else was

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

under discussion, and I quoted the following verse:—

From the miracles of our spiritual Leader what a wonder!  
The snow fell, and he stated "the snow is falling."

Needless to say, none of us Kermanis have, since that date, thought of
educating our sons in Europe; and surely we are wiser than the Tehranis,
who are now constantly sending their sons to Paris and London. There is
also the fear lest our youths might become enamoured of a Christian
maiden and follow the evil example of *Shaykh* Sinan, who, in like case,
deserted his band of disciples and grazed a herd of swine. As Sadi
wrote:

I saw a holy man in a mountain,  
Who, abandoning the world, took up his abode in a cave;  
I asked him, "Why dost thou not visit the city  
So that thou mightest distract thyself somewhat?"  
He replied, "There are beauteous fairies there;  
When there is much mud, the elephants slip."

In short, whenever I pass the school which is held near my house and
hear all the boys learning to recite our holy Koran, I exclaim, "Praise
be to Allah, this is true education." Moreover, if a boy complains to me
of the severity of the teacher and the frequency with which punishment
is inflicted, I reply, "Know, 'O son,' that a blow from the teacher's
rod is like a rose leaf." Thus do I comfort scholars.

I have not hitherto referred fully to the

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

question of religion, and I do not expect that this work will move
Christians to become true believers; but yet I know that there is much
ignorance among them; and so it is right that I should lessen this by
giving some account of our religion, and, to begin with, it is
impossible to do better than to narrate the interview between the early
refugees from Mecca and the Negus of Abyssinia.

Then the Negus sent unto the followers of the Apostle of Allah. So when
they came to him, he inquired of them saying, "What is this religion, by
reason of which ye have separated from your people, yet enter not withal
into my religion, nor into the religion of any other of these churches?"

Then answered him Jafar, the son of Abu Talib (may the approval of Allah
rest upon him!), saying, "O King! We were a barbarous folk, worshipping
idols, eating carrion, committing shameful deeds, violating the ties of
consanguinity, and evilly entreating our neighbours, the strong amongst
us consuming the weak; and thus we continued until Allah sent unto us an
Apostle from our midst, whose pedigree, and integrity, and faithfulness,
and purity of life we knew, to summon us to Allah, that we should
declare His unity, and worship Him, and put away the stones and idols
which we and our fathers used to worship in His stead; and he bade us be
truthful in speech, and faithful in the fulfilment of our trusts, and
observing of the ties of consanguinity and the duties of neighbours, and
to refrain from forbidden things and from blood; and he forbade us from
immoral acts and deceitful words, and from consuming the property of
orphans, and from slandering virtuous women; and he commanded us to
worship Allah, and to associate naught else with Him,

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

and to pray, and give alms and fast." Then the Negus wept and said to
them, "Verily this and that which Moses brought emanate from one lamp."

O men of Europe, surely it is wiser for us who are "People who possess a
revealed Scripture" to agree with the Negus than to remain divided as if
by a bottomless gulf.

To resume, it is, of course, known to the instructed that the Mussulmans
in the world are divided into two great divisions and seventy-two
subdivisions. The Persians term themselves Shias or "Separatists," and
the rest of the Mussulmans are, generally speaking, Sunnis or "Followers
of the Traditions," although there are many Shias in Hindustan and
elsewhere.

We Shias consider that *Hazrat* Ali, on Him and on his family be Peace,
was the true successor of the Prophet.

Ali is the pearl of the ocean of eternity;  
Ali is the successor of Mohamed.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Consequently, the
three caliphs who ruled before Ali came to his rights are considered to
be usurpers by us; Omar, in particular, who conquered Persia, being
especially accursed. It is also firmly believed that the last *Imam* is
not dead, but hidden. *Inshallah!* I shall refer to this question again.

Apart from the great division between the Shias and Sunnis there are
also minor divisions,

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

and, in Kerman, almost all the *Khans* belonged to the Shaykhi sect, and
believed that at the resurrection men would only arise in the spirit and
not in the flesh. Moreover, it was believed that there must always be a
special channel of grace between the hidden *Imam* and his church.
*Haji* Mohamed Kerim Khan of the Kajar family was the head of the
Shaykhis when I first lived at Kerman; and, as my mother also belonged
to the Kajar family, I was brought up to respect them.

Yet it is the Sufi creed which really attracted me, and which I have
already referred to. Many are the hours I spent listening to the
*Murshid* or Spiritual Head of the Mahun Shrine, and my heart approved
when he repeated again and again that all religious fanaticism was the
result of ignorance, and that it must be swept away to make place for
universal love.

Do not listen to the strife amongst the seventy-two religions:  
Not seeing the way of reality they have strayed into romance.

During the whole of his life he slept but four hours in the night,
merely wrapping himself in his brown cloak, and lying down on the bare
floor. Moreover, he strictly limited himself to the number of mouthfuls
of food which he deemed actually necessary to sustain his slender frame.

He died while giving a lecture to his eager

disciples on the love of Allah, murmuring 'Hu, Hu, Hu.' <span
id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) In truth he was a holy man. May Allah
forgive him!

I have referred to this question, for Allah knows there be enough
sinners among the Mussulmans; but they alone will travel for months
across deserts, and bear heat and cold, hunger and thirst, which kills
many among them. Yet on they press in thousands, and all in the hope
that they may gaze on the tomb of the martyred *Imam*, the innocent
Riza. On Him and on his family be Peace! To make this pilgrimage one day
became, from this period, my fixed desire.

To conclude this chapter what better can I say than that—

Kerman is the heart of the world, and we are men of heart.
