## X

SINGER, sweet Singer, fresh notes strew,  
Fresh and afresh and new and new!  
Heart-gladdening wine thy lips imbrue,  
Fresh and afresh and new and new!

Saki, thy radiant feet I hail;  
Flush with red wine the goblets pale,  
Flush our pale cheeks to drunken hue,  
Fresh and afresh and new and new!

Then with thy love to toy with thee,  
Rest thee, ah, rest! where none can see  
Seek thy delight, for kisses sue,  
Fresh and afresh and new and new!

Here round thy life the vine is twined;  
Drink I for elsewhere what wine wilt find?  
Drink to her name, to hours that flew,  
Hours ever fresh and new and new!

She that has stolen my heart from me,  
How does she wield her empery?  
Paints and adorns and scents her too,  
Fresh and afresh and new and new!

Wind of the dawn that passest by,  
Swift to the street of my fairy hie,  
Whisper the tale of Hafiz true,  
Fresh and afresh and new and new!
