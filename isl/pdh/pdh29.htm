<p>MY friend has fled! alas, my friend has fled,<br> And left me nought but tears and pain behind!<br> Like smoke above a flame caught by the wind,<br> So rose she from my breast and forth she sped.<br> Drunk with desire, I seized Love's cup divine,<br> But she that held it poured the bitter wine<br> Of Separation into it and fled.</p>  
<p>The hunter she, and I the helpless prey;<br> Wounded and sick, round me her toils she drew,<br> My heart into a sea of sorrow threw,<br> Bound up her camel loads and fled away.<br> Fain had I laid an ambush for her soul,<br> She saw and vanished, and the timid foal,<br> Good Fortune, slipped the rein and would not stay.</p>  
<p>My heart was all too narrow for my woe,<br> And tears of blood my weeping eyes have shed,<br> A crimson stream across the desert sped,<br> Rising from out my sad heart's overflow.<br> She knew not what Love's meanest slave can tell:<br> "'Tis sweet to serve!" but threw me a Farewell,<br> Kissing my threshold, turned, and cried "I go!"</p>  
<p>In the clear dawn, before the east was red,<br> Before the rose had torn her veil in two,<br> A nightingale through Hafiz&#146; garden flew,<br> Stayed but to fill its song with tears, and fled.</p>
