*Poems from the Divan of Hafiz*, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, \[1897\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

## XV

RETURN! that to a heart wounded full sore  
Valiance and strength may enter in; return!  
And Life shall pause at the deserted door,  
The cold dead body breathe again and burn.  
Oh come! and touch mine eyes, of thy sweet grace,  
For I am blind to all but to thy face.  
Open the gates and bid me see once more!

Like to a cruel Ethiopian band,  
Sorrow despoiled the kingdom of my heart  
Return! glad Lord of Rome, and free the land;  
Before thine arms the foe shall break and part.  
See now, I hold a mirror to mine eyes,  
And nought but thy reflection therein lies;  
The glass speaks truth to them that understand.

Night is with child, hast thou not heard men say?  
"Night is with child! what will she bring to birth?"  
I sit and ask the stars when thou'rt away.  
Oh come! and when the nightingale of mirth  
Pipes in the Spring-awakened garden ground,  
In Hafiz’ heart shall ring a sweeter sound,  
Diviner nightingales attune their lay.
