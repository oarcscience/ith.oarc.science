## XXXV

FORGET not when dear friend to friend returned,  
Forget not days gone by, forget them not!  
My mouth has tasted bitterness, and learned  
To drink the envenomed cup of mortal lot;  
Forget not when a sweeter draught was mine,  
Loud rose the songs of them that drank that wine—  
Forget them not!

Forget not loyal lovers long since dead,  
Though faith and loyalty should be forgot,  
Though the earth cover the enamoured head,  
And in the dust wisdom and passion rot.  
My friends have thrust me from their memory;  
Vainly a thousand thousand times I cry:  
Forget me not!

Weary I turn me to my bonds again.  
Once there were hands strong to deliver me,  
Forget not when they broke a poor slave's chain!  
Though from mine eyes tears flow unceasingly,  
I think on them whose rose gardens are set  
Beside the Zindeh Rud, and I forget  
Life's misery.

Sorrow has made her lair in my breast,  
And undisturbed she lies—forget them not  
That drove her forth like to a hunted beast!  
Hafiz, thou and thy tears shall be forgot,  
Lock fast the gates of thy sad heart! But those  
That held the key to thine unspoken woes—  
Forget them not!
