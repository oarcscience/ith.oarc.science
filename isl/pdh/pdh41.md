## XXXIX

CYPRESS and Tulip and sweet Eglantine,  
Of these the tale from lip to lip is sent;  
Washed by three cups, oh Saki, of thy wine,  
My song shall turn upon this argument.  
Spring, bride of all the meadows, rises up,  
Clothed in her ripest beauty: fill the cup!  
Of Spring's handmaidens runs this song of mine.

The sugar-loving birds of distant Ind,  
Except a Persian sweetmeat that was brought  
To fair Bengal, have found nought to their mind.  
See how my song, that in one night was wrought,  
Defies the limits set by space and time!  
O'er plains and mountain-tops my fearless rhyme,  
Child of a night, its year-long road shall find.

And thou whose sense is dimmed with piety,  
Thou too shalt learn the magic of her eyes;  
Forth comes the caravan of sorcery  
When from those gates the blue-veined curtains rise.  
And when she walks the flowery meadows through,  
Upon the jasmine's shamèd cheek the dew  
Gathers like sweat, she is so fair to see!

Ah, swerve not from the path of righteousness  
Though the world lure thee! like a wrinkled crone,  
Hiding beneath her robe lasciviousness,  
She plunders them that pause and heed her moan.  
From Sinai Moses brings thee wealth untold;  
Bow not thine head before the calf of gold  
Like Samir, following after wickedness.

From the Shah's garden blows the wind of Spring,  
The tulip in her lifted chalice bears  
A dewy wine of Heaven's minist’ring  
Until Ghiyasuddin, the Sultan, hears,  
Sing, Hafiz, of thy longing for his face.  
The breezes whispering round thy dwelling-place  
Shall carry thy lament unto the King.
