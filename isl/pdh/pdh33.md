Intangible Textual Heritage

## XXXI

THE breath of Dawn's musk-strewing wind shall blow,  
The ancient world shall turn to youth again,  
And other wines from out Spring's chalice flow;  
Wine-red, the judas-tree shall set before  
The pure white jessamine a brimming cup,  
And wind flowers lift their scarlet chalice up  
For the star-pale narcissus to adore.

The long-drawn tyranny of grief shall pass,  
Parting shall end in meeting, the lament  
Of the sad bird that sang "Alas, alas!"  
Shall reach the rose in her red-curtained tent.  
Forth from the mosque! the tavern calls to me!  
Would'st hinder us? The preacher's homily  
Is long, but life will soon be spent!

Ah, foolish Heart! the pleasures of To-day,  
If thou abandon, will To-morrow stand  
Thy surety for the gold thou'st thrown away?  
In Sha'aban the troops of Grief disband,  
And crown the hours with wine's red coronet—  
The sun of merriment ere long will set,  
And meagre Ramazan is close at hand!

Dear is the rose—now, now her sweets proclaim,  
While yet the purple petals blush and blow;  
Hither adown the path of Spring she came,  
And by the path of Autumn she will go.  
Now, while we listen, Minstrel, tune thy lay!  
Thyself hast said: "The Present steals away  
The Future comes, and bringing—what? Dost know?"

Summoned by thy melody did Hafiz rise  
Out of the darkness near thy lips to dwell;  
Back to the dark again his pathway lies—  
Sing out, sing clear, and singing cry: Farewell!
