## IV

SLEEP on thine eyes, bright as narcissus flowers,  
Falls not in vain  
And not in vain thy hair's soft radiance showers  
Ah, not in vain!

Before the milk upon thy lips was dry,  
I said: "Lips where the salt of wit doth lie,  
Sweets shall be mingled with thy mockery,  
And not in vain!"

Thy mouth the fountain where Life's waters flow,  
A dimpled well of tears is set below,  
And death lies near to life thy lovers know,  
But know in vain!

God send to thee great length of happy days  
Lo, not for his own life thy servant prays;  
Love's dart in thy bent brows the Archer lays,  
Nor shoots in vain.

Art thou with grief afflicted, with the smart  
Of absence, and is bitter toil thy part?  
Thy lamentations and thy tears, oh Heart,  
Are not in vain

Last night the wind from out her village blew,  
And wandered all the garden alleys through,  
Oh rose, tearing thy bosom's robe in two;  
’Twas not in vain!

And Hafiz, though thy heart within thee dies,  
Hiding love's agony from curious eyes,  
Ah, not in vain thy tears, not vain thy sighs,  
Not all in vain!
