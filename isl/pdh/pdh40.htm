<p>I CEASE not from desire till my desire<br> Is satisfied; or let my mouth attain<br> My love's red mouth, or let my soul expire,<br> Sighed from those lips that sought her lips in vain.<br> Others may find another love as fair;<br> Upon her threshold I have laid my head,<br> The dust shall cover me, still lying there,<br> When from my body life and love have fled.</p>  
<p>My soul is on my lips ready to fly,<br> But grief beats in my heart and will not cease,<br> Because not once, not once before I die,<br> Will her sweet lips give all my longing peace.<br> My breath is narrowed down to one long sigh<br> For a red mouth that burns my thoughts like fire;<br> When will that mouth draw near and make reply<br> To one whose life is straitened with desire?</p>  
<p>When I am dead, open my grave and see<br> The cloud of smoke that rises round thy feet:<br> In my dead heart the fire still burns for thee;<br> Yea, the smoke rises from my winding-sheet!<br> Ah, come, Beloved! for the meadows wait<br> Thy coming, and the thorn bears flowers instead<br> Of thorns, the cypress fruit, and desolate<br> Bare winter from before thy steps has fled.</p>  
<p>Hoping within some garden ground to find<br> A red rose soft and sweet as thy soft cheek,<br> Through every meadow blows the western wind,<br> Through every garden he is fain to seek.<br> Reveal thy face! that the whole world may be<br> Bewildered by thy radiant loveliness;<br> The cry of man and woman comes to thee,<br> Open thy lips and comfort their distress!</p>  
<p>Each curling lock of thy luxuriant hair<br> Breaks into barb&egrave;d hooks to catch my heart,<br> My broken heart is wounded everywhere<br> With countless wounds from which the red drops start.<br> Yet when sad lovers meet and tell their sighs,<br> Not without praise shall Hafiz&#146; name be said,<br> Not without tears, in those pale companies<br> Where joy has been forgot and hope has fled.</p>
