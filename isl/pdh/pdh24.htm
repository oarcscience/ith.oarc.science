<p>THE rose is not fair without the beloved's face,<br> Nor merry the Spring without the sweet laughter of wine;<br> The path through the fields, and winds from a flower strewn place,<br> Without her bright check, which glows like a tulip fine,<br> Nor winds softly blowing, fields deep in corn, are fair.</p>  
<p>And lips like to sugar, grace like a flower that sways,<br> Are nought without kisses many and dalliance sweet;<br> If thousands of voices sang not the rose's praise,<br> The joy of the cypress her opening bud to greet,<br> Nor dancing of boughs nor blossoming rose were fair.</p>  
<p>Though limned by most skilful fingers, no pictures please<br> Unless the beloved's image is drawn therein;<br> The garden and flowers, and hair flowing loose on the breeze,<br> Unless to my Lady's side I may strive and win,<br> Nor garden, nor flowers, nor loose flying curls are fair.</p>  
<p>Hast seen at a marriage-feast, when the mirth runs high,<br> The revellers scatter gold with a careless hand?<br> The gold of thy heart, oh Hafiz, despised doth lie,<br> Not worthy thy love to be cast by a drunken band<br> At the feet of her who is fairer than all that's fair.</p>
