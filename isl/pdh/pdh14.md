## XII

WHERE is my ruined life, and where the fame  
Of noble deeds?  
Look on my long-drawn road, and whence it came,  
And where it leads!

Can drunkenness be linked to piety  
And good repute?  
Where is the preacher's holy monody,  
Where is the lute?

From monkish cell and lying garb released,  
Oh heart of mine,  
Where is the Tavern fane, the Tavern priest,  
Where is the wine?

Past days of meeting, let the memory  
Of you be sweet!  
Where are those glances fled, and where for me  
Reproaches meet?

His friend's bright face warms not the enemy  
When love is done—  
Where is the extinguished lamp that made night day,  
Where is the sun?

Balm to mine eyes the dust, my head I bow  
Upon thy stair.  
Where shall I go, where from thy presence? thou  
Art everywhere.

Look not upon the dimple of her chin,  
Danger lurks there!  
Where wilt thou hide, oh trembling heart, fleeing in  
Such mad haste—where?

To steadfastness and patience, friend, ask not  
If Hafiz keep—  
Patience and steadfastness I have forgot,  
And where is sleep?
