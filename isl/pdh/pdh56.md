*Poems from the Divan of Hafiz*, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, \[1897\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## XIV

*Stanza 1*.—Hafiz wrote this poem upon the death of his son.

*Stanza 3*.—Rosenzweig, in his edition of the Divan, says that the
allusion is to the dust and water which God kneaded into the body of
Adam, and that, out of derision, Hafiz; calls the human body a house of
joy.

The moon, according to Persian superstition, has a baneful influence
upon human life.

*Stanza 4*.—Rosenzweig says that "I had not castled" means that Hafiz;
had not taken the precaution of marrying his son, and so securing for
himself grandchildren who would have been a consolation to him on their
father's death. For that reason he had nothing more to lose, and was
indifferent as to what his next move in the game should be.
