<p>THE jewel of the secret treasury<br> Is still the same as once it was; the seal<br> Upon Love's treasure casket, and the key,<br> Are still what thieves can neither break nor steal;<br> Still among lovers loyalty is found,<br> And therefore faithful eyes still strew the ground<br> With the same pearls that mine once strewed for thee.</p>  
<p>Question the wandering winds and thou shalt know<br> That from the dusk until the dawn doth break,<br> My consolation is that still they blow<br> The perfume of thy curls across my cheek.<br> A dart from thy bent brows has wounded me&#151;<br> Ah, come! my heart still waiteth helplessly,<br> Has waited ever, till thou heal its pain.</p>  
<p>If seekers after rubies there were none,<br> Still to the dark mines where the gems had lain<br> Would pierce, as he was wont, the radiant sun,<br> Setting the stones ablaze. Would'st hide the stain<br> Of my heart's blood? Blood-red the ruby glows<br> (And whence it came my wounded bosom knows)<br> Upon thy lips to show what thou hast done.</p>  
<p>Let not thy curls waylay my pilgrim soul,<br> As robbers use, and plunder me no more!<br> Years join dead year, but thine extortionate rule<br> Is still the same, merciless as before.<br> Sing, Hafiz, sing again of eyes that weep!<br> For still the fountain of our tears is deep<br> As once it was, and still with tears is full.</p>
