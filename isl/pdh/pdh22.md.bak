## XX

FROM out the street of So-and-So,  
Oh wind, bring perfumes sweet to me  
For I am sick and pale with woe;  
Oh bring me rest from misery!  
The dust that lies before her door,  
Love's long desired elixir, pour  
Upon this wasted heart of mine—  
Bring me a promise and a sign!

Between the ambush of mine eyes  
And my heart's fort there's enmity—  
Her eye-brow's bow, the dart that flies,  
Beneath her lashes, bring to me!  
Sorrow and absence, glances cold,  
Before my time have made me old;  
A wine-cup from the hand of Youth  
Bring me for pity and for ruth!

Then shall all unbelievers taste  
A draught or two of that same wine;  
But if they like it not, oh haste!  
And let joy's flowing cup be mine.  
Cup-bearer, seize to-day, nor wait  
Until to-morrow!—or from Fate  
Some passport to felicity,  
Some written surety bring to me!

My heart threw back the veil of woe,  
Consoled by Hafiz melody:  
From out the street of So-and-So,  
Oh wind, bring perfumes sweet to me!
