*Poems from the Divan of Hafiz*, by Getrude Lowthian Bell, \[1897\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## XXXV

*Stanza 1*.—The second line of this poem is as often quoted as any,
perhaps, in the Divan: " Yàd bàd àn ruz-i-gàràn, yàd bàd!" A man will
set it upon a letter to an absent friend, even when he is not
particularly anxious that days gone by should be preserved from
oblivion; and how often must the simple little line have been used by
those to whom its very simplicity made it more poignant than pages of
sentiment!

*Stanza 3*.—The Zindeh Rud was a river that flowed past Isfahan. There
are unfortunately no longer rose-gardens upon its banks, for it
disappeared completely in the terrible earthquake which occurred in the
spring of the year 1853. I suspect from internal evidence that this poem
was sent to some friends of Hafiz living at Isfahan, upon whom the
passionate appeal need refiect no discredit, since it may quite possibly
be merely the Oriental way of writing a letter of thanks. At the same
time, in spite of this rational explanation, it must be acknowledged
that the meaning of the name Zindeh Rud is River of Life. I tremble to
think into what a slough of mysticism the innocent little stream might
be induced to guide us!
