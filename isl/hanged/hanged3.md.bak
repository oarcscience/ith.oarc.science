## THE POEM OF ZUHAIR<span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#note_1.md)

   "Does the blackened ruin, situated in the stony ground between Durraj
and Mutathallam, which did not speak to me, when addressed, belong to
the abode of Ummi Awfa?

   "And is it her dwelling at the two stony meadows, seeming as though
they were the renewed tattoo marks in the sinews of the wrist?

   "The wild cows and the white deer are wandering about there, one herd
behind the other, while their young are springing up from every
lying-down place.

   "I stood again near it, (the encampment of the tribe of Awfa,) after
an absence of twenty years, and with some efforts, I know her abode
again after thinking awhile.

   "I recognized the three stones blackened by fire at the place where
the kettle used to be placed at night, and the trench round the
encampment, which had not burst, like the source of a pool.

   "And when I recognized the encampment I said to its site, 'Now good
morning, oh spot; may you be safe from dangers.'

   "Look, oh my friend! do you see any women traveling on camels, going
over the high ground above the stream of Jurthum?<span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#note_2.md)

   "They have covered their howdahs with coverlets of high value, and
with a thin screen, the fringes of which are red, resembling blood.

   "And they inclined toward the valley of Soobán, ascending the center
of it, and in their faces were the fascinating looks of a soft-bodied
person brought up in easy circumstances;

   "They arose early in the morning and got up at dawn, and they went
straight to the valley of Rass as the hand goes unswervingly to the
mouth, when eating.

   "And amongst them is a place of amusement for the far-sighted one,
and a pleasant sight for the eye of the looker who looks attentively.

   "As if the pieces of dyed wool which they left in every place in
which they halted, were the seeds of night-shade which have not been
crushed.

   "When they arrived at the water, the mass of which was blue from
intense purity, they laid down their walking sticks, (*i.e.*, took their
lodging there,) like the dweller who has pitched his tents.

   "They kept the hill of Qanan and the rough ground about it on their
hand; while there are many, dwelling in Qanan, the shedding of whose
blood is lawful and unlawful.<span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#note_3.md)

   "They came out from the valley of Soobán, then they crossed it,
riding in every Qainian howdah new and widened.

   "Then I swear by the temple, round which walk the men who built it
from the tribes of Quraish and Jurhum.<span
id="fr_4"></span>[4](#note_4.md)

   "An oath, that you are verily two excellent chiefs, who are found
worthy of honor in every condition, between ease and distress.<span
id="fr_5"></span>[5](#note_5.md)

   "The two endeavorers from the tribe of Ghaiz bin Murrah strove in
making peace after the connection between the tribes had become broken,
on account of the shedding of blood.

   "You repaired with peace the condition of the tribes of 'Abs and
Zubyán, after they had fought with one another, and ground up the
perfume of Manshim between them.<span id="fr_6"></span>[6](#note_6.md)

   "And indeed you said, 'if we bring about peace perfectly by the
spending of money and the conferring of benefits, and by good words, we
shall be safe from the danger of the two tribes, destroying each other.'

   "You occupied by reason of this the best of positions, and became far
from the reproach of being undutiful and sinful.

   "And you became great in the high nobility of Ma'add; may you be
guided in the right way; and he who spends his treasure of glory will
become great.

   "The memory of the wounds is obliterated by the hundreds of camels,
and he, who commenced paying off the blood money by instalments, was not
guilty of it (*i.e.*, of making war).

   "One tribe pays it to another tribe as an indemnity, while they who
gave the indemnity did not shed blood sufficient for the filling of a
cupping glass.

   "Then there was being driven to them from the property you inherited,
a booty of various sorts from young camels with slit ears.

   "Now, convey from me to the tribe of Zubyán and their allies a
message,—'verily you have sworn by every sort of oath to keep the
peace.'

   "Do not conceal from God what is in your breast that it may be
hidden; whatever is concealed, God knows all about it.

   "Either it will be put off and placed recorded in a book, and
preserved there until the judgment day; or the punishment be hastened
and so he will take revenge.

   "And war is not but what you have learnt it to be, and what you have
experienced, and what is said concerning it, is not a story based on
suppositions.

   "When you stir it up, you will stir it up as an accursed thing, and
it will become greedy when you excite its greed and it will rage
fiercely.

   "Then it will grind you as the grinding of the upper millstone
against the lower, and it will conceive immediately after one birth and
it will produce twins.<span id="fr_7"></span>[7](#note_7.md)

   "By my life I swear, how good a tribe it is upon whom Husain Bin
Zamzam brought an injury by committing a crime which did not please
them.<span id="fr_8"></span>[8](#note_8.md)

   "And he had concealed his hatred, and did not display it, and did not
proceed to carry out his intention until he got a good opportunity.

   "And he said, 'I will perform my object of avenging myself, and I
will guard myself from my enemy with a thousand bridled horses behind
me.'

   "Then he attacked his victim from 'Abs, but did not cause fear to the
people of the many houses, near which death had thrown down his
baggage.<span id="fr_9"></span>[9](#note_9.md)

   "They allowed their animals to graze until when the interval between
the hours of drinking was finished, they took them to the deep pool,
which is divided by weapons and by shedding of blood.<span
id="fr_10"></span>[10](#note_10.md)

   "They accomplished their object amongst themselves, then they led the
animals back to the pasture of unwholesome indigestible grass.

   "I have grown weary of the troubles of life; and he, who lives eighty
years will, mayest thou have no father if thou doubt<span
id="fr_11"></span>[11](#note_11.md) grow weary.

   "And I know what has happened to-day and yesterday, before it, but
verily, of the knowledge of what will happen to-morrow; I am ignorant.

   "I see death is like the blundering of a blind camel;—him whom he
meets he kills, and he whom he misses lives and will become old.

   "And he who does not act with kindness in many affairs will be torn
by teeth and trampled under foot.

   "And he, who makes benevolent acts intervene before honor, increases
his honor; and he, who does not avoid abuse, will be abused.

   "He, who is possessed of plenty, and is miserly with his great wealth
toward his people, will be dispensed with, and abused.

   "He who keeps his word, will not be reviled; and he whose heart is
guided to self-satisfying benevolence will not stammer.

   "And he who dreads the causes of death, they will reach him, even if
he ascends the tracts of the heavens with a ladder.

   "And he, who shows kindness to one not deserving it, his praise will
be a reproach against him, and he will repent of having shown kindness.

   "And he who rebels against the butt ends of the spears, then verily
he will have to obey the spear points joined to every long spear
shaft.<span id="fr_12"></span>[12](#note_12.md)

   "And he who does not repulse with his weapons from his tank, will
have it broken; and he who does not oppress the people will be
oppressed.

   "And he who travels should consider his friend an enemy; and he who
does not respect himself will not be respected.

   "And he, who is always seeking to bear the burdens of other people,
and does not excuse himself from it, will one day by reason of his
abasement, repent.

   "And whatever of character there is in a man, even though he thinks
it concealed from people, it is known.

   "He, who does not cease asking people to carry him, and does not make
himself independent of them even for one day of the time, will be
regarded with disgust.

   "Many silent ones you see, pleasing to you, but their excess in
wisdom or deficiency will appear at the time of talking.

   "The tongue of a man is one half, and the other half is his mind, and
here is nothing besides these two, except the shape of the blood and the
flesh.

   "And verily, as to the folly of an old man there is no wisdom after
it, but the young man after his folly may become wise.

   "We asked of you, and you gave, and we returned to the asking and you
returned to the giving, and he who increases the asking, will one day be
disappointed."

### Footnotes

<span id="note_1"></span>[1](#fr_1.md) This poem begins, as do most Arab
poems, with love longings, but soon drifts into praise of two
peacemakers and the story of the feud between two tribes which preceded
the peace. From this field the poem soon wanders to the philosophic
maxims of the author. Zuhair is above, all a philosopher.

<span id="note_2"></span>[2](#fr_2.md) He fancies he sees the women again
whom he saw twenty years previously, and he appeals to his companion to
know if what he sees is real.

<span id="note_3"></span>[3](#fr_3.md) There are many enemies and many
friends dwelling there.

<span id="note_4"></span>[4](#fr_4.md) This refers to the temple at Mecca
which was built by Ismail, son of Abraham, ancestor of the tribe of
Quraish, who married a woman of Jurhum, an old tribe of Yaman, who were
the keepers of the temple before Quraish.

<span id="note_5"></span>[5](#fr_5.md) The theme changes here abruptly, to
praise of two peacemakers.

<span id="note_6"></span>[6](#fr_6.md) Some Arabs, making a league to be
revenged against their enemies, took oath with their hands plunged in a
certain perfume, made by Manshim, as a sign of their coalition. They
fought until they were slain to the last of them. Hence the proverb,
"More unlucky than the perfume of Manshim."

<span id="note_7"></span>[7](#fr_7.md) The misfortunes arising from war are
double.

<span id="note_8"></span>[8](#fr_8.md) Husain Bin Zamzam's father was
killed during the war between the Benî Zubyán and the Benî 'Abs. When
peace was concluded between the tribes, he made a vow secretly that he
would kill one of the tribe of 'Abs out of the revenge for his father.
This he did, but when the Benî 'Abs came to take revenge on him, Hárith
Ibn 'Awf offered them one hundred camels as blood money or his own son
to kill. The 'Absioms took the camels and spared his son. The poet is
now praising them for their act.

<span id="note_9"></span>[9](#fr_9.md) He killed no one while the peace was
in force except the one person on whom he meant to take revenge.

<span id="note_10"></span>[10](#fr_10.md) By the deep pool is meant war,
and the meaning of the lines is that the tribes refrained from war for a
certain time, after which they again had recourse to arms.

<span id="note_11"></span>[11](#fr_11.md) A common term of imprecation.

<span id="note_12"></span>[12](#fr_12.md) The wandering desert Arabs when
they met used to present the butt ends of their spears toward one
another if their intentions were peaceful, the points if they intended
fighting.
