IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE COMPASSIONATE, THE MERCIFUL

# PART I

## THE PERFECT FACE OF THE BELOVED

### THE EYE AND THE LIP

WHAT is the nature of the eye and the lip?  
Let us consider.

Coquettish and intoxicating glances shine from His eye.  
The essence of existence issues from His ruby lip.  
Hearts burn with desire because of His eye,  
And are healed again by the smile of His lip.

Because of His eye hearts are aching and drunken.  
His ruby lip gives soul-garments to men.  
His eye does not perceive this visible world,  
Yet often His lip quivers with compassion.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Sometimes He charms us with a touch of humanity,  
And gives help to the despairing.  
It is His smile that gives life to man's water and clay;  
It is His breath that opens heaven's gate for us.  
A corn-baited snare is each glance of that eye,  
And a wine-shop lurks in each corner.

When He frowns the wide world is laid waste,  
But is restored every moment by His kiss.  
Our blood is at fever point because of His eye,  
Our souls demented because of His lip.

How He has despoiled our hearts by a frown!  
How He has uplifted our souls by a smile!  
If you ask of Him an embrace,  
His eye will say "Yea," His lip "Nay."  
He finished the creation of the world by a frown,  
Now and then the soul is revived by a kiss.  
We would give up our lives with despair at His frown,  
But would rise from the dead at his kiss.

. . . When the world meditates on His eye and His lip,  
It yields itself to the intoxication of wine.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

### THE MOLE

THE single point of the mole in His cheek  
Is a centre from which circles  
A circumference.  
The two worlds circle round that centre.  
The heart and soul of Adam evolved from there.

. . . Hearts bleed because they are a reflection  
Of the point of that black mole,  
And both are stagnant; for there is no escape  
Of the reflection from the reflect.

Unity will not embrace Plurality,  
For the point of Unity has one root only.

. . . I wonder if His mole is the reflection of my heart,  
Or my heart the reflection of His mole.  
Was my heart created from His mole's reflection?  
Or may it be seen shining in His mole?  
I wonder if my heart is in His face,  
Or if His mole abides in my heart.  
But this is a deep secret hidden, alas! from me.

. . . If my heart is a reflection,  
Why is it ever so changing?

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

Sometimes tired like His brilliant eye,  
Sometimes waving to and fro as His curl waves,  
Sometimes a shining moonbeam like His face,  
Sometimes a dark shadow like His mole,  
Sometimes it is a mosque, sometimes a synagogue,  
Sometimes a hell, sometimes a heaven,  
Sometimes soaring above the seventh heaven,  
Sometimes buried far below this earth.

. . . After a spell the devotee and ascetic  
Turns again to wine, lamp, and beauty.

### THE CURL

IF you ask of me the long story  
Of the Beloved's curl,  
I cannot answer, for it contains a mystery  
Which only true lovers understand,  
And they, maddened by its beauty,  
Are held captive as by a golden chain.  
I spoke too openly of that graceful form,  
But the end of the curl told me to hide its glory,  
So that the path to it should be twisted  
And crooked and difficult.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

That curl enchains lovers' hearts,  
And bears their souls to and fro  
In the sea of desire. A hundred thousand hearts  
Are tightly bound, not one escapes, alas!

No single infidel would remain in the world  
If he could see the shaking aside  
Of those black curls,  
And on the earth there would not remain a faithful soul  
If they were always in their place.  
Suppose they were shorn. . . . No matter,  
Day would increase and the night disappear.

As a spider spreads its nets to ensnare,  
So does the Beloved in wantonness  
Shake His locks from off His face.

Behold His hands plundering Reason's caravan  
And with knots binding it tight.

Never at rest is that curl,  
Ever moving to and fro  
Making now night, making now morning,  
Playing with the seasons in wonder.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

Adam was created when the perfume of that  
amber-scented curl  
Was blown by the wind on his clay.

And I too possess an ensample;  
I cannot wait for a moment,  
But breathlessly start working anew  
To tear my heart out of my breast.  
. . . Sore troubled am I by that curl  
Which veils my longing soul from His face.

### THE CHEEK AND THE DOWN

THE theatre of Divine beauty is the cheek,  
And the down is the entrance to His holy presence.  
Beauty is erased by His cheek, who says,  
"Without my presence you are non-existent."  
In the unseen world the down is as green meadows  
Leading to the mansion of Eternal Life.  
The blackness of His curl turns day into night,  
The down of His cheek holds the secret of life.  
If only you can glimpse His face and its down,  
You will understand the meaning of plurality and unity.  
His curl will teach you the knowledge of this world,  
His down will reveal hidden paths.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

Imagine seven verses in which each letter  
Contains oceans of mysteries;  
Such is His cheek.  
And imagine, hidden beneath each hair of His cheek,  
Thousands of oceans of mysteries;  
Such is His down.

As the heart is God's throne in the water,  
So is the down the ornament of the soul.
