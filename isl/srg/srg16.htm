<p>ARE you still turning to great and small?<br> Pondering on religion and piety,<br> Teachership and discipleship?<br> Which mean hypocrisy and bondage.<br> Then idols and girdles<br> And Christianity are still yours.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">IDOLS</h3>  
<p>THE idol's real being is not vain<br> Because God created it,<br> And all things from Him are good.<br> Being is pure good, if it contains evil<br> That comes from "other."<br> Truth is idol-worship,<br> If the Mussulman only knew;</p>  
<p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></A></p>  
<p>But he sees in idols<br> Only the visible creature,<br> Not the Truth hidden in the idol.<br> Idol-worship is unification,<br> Since all things are the symbols of Being.</p>  
<p>By counting beads, repeating prayers,<br> And reading the Koran,<br> The heathen becomes not a Mussulman.<br> The man to whom true infidelity becomes revealed<br> With pretended faith becomes disgusted.</p>  
<p>Within every body a soul is hidden,<br> And true faith conceals infidelity.</p>  
<p>Who adorned the face of the idol<br> With such beauty?<br> And who becomes an idol-worshipper<br> Unless God wills it?</p>  
<p>In all things<br> See but One, say One, know One,</p>  
<p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE GIRDLE</h3>  
<p>THE mark of service<br> Is the knotted girdle.<br> So gird your loins, like a valiant man<br> With manliness.<br> Cast aside vain tales,<br> And mystic states and visions;<br> Dream not of lights,<br> Of marvels, of miracles,<br> For your miracles are contained<br> In worshipping the Truth;<br> All else is pride, conceit,<br> And illusion of existence.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHRISTIANITY</h3>  
<p>I SEE the desire of Christianity<br> Is purification from self,<br> And liberty from bondage.</p>  
<p>There is a sanctuary of the soul,<br> The blessed portal of unity,<br> The nest of the Eternal.<br> God's Spirit (Jesus),<br> Who proceeds from the blessed Spirit,<br> Taught this doctrine.</p>  
<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A></p>  
<p>In you is placed a soul,<br> Which is a sample of this blessed Spirit.<br> Find release from humanity's carnal desire<br> And you will enter the Divine Life.<br> And he who is pure as the angels are<br> Will be carried up to the fourth heaven.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE MOSQUE AND THE CLOISTER</h3>  
<p>IF "other" and "others" are before your eyes,<br> Then a mosque is no better<br> Than a Christian cloister;<br> But when the garment of "other" is cast off by you,<br> The cloister becomes a mosque.</p>
