### EPILOGUE

THIS bouquet of scented blossoms  
I have plucked from that garden,  
And have called it "The Secret Rose Garden."  
In it are blooming  
Roses of the mysteries of the heart  
Untold before;  
In it the tongues of the lilies are all singing,  
And the eyes of the narcissus behold all, far and near.  
Gaze on each one of these with your heart's eyes  
Till your doubts melt away.  
You will see tradition, earthly and mystical truths,  
All arranged clearly in knowledge of detail.  
Do not seek with cold eyes to find blemishes,  
Or the roses will turn to thorns as you gaze.  
Ingratitude is a sign of ignorance,  
For those who know the truth are thankful.  
When you remember me, breathe "Mercy be upon him."  
I am ending with my own name,  
"O Allah, grant me a 'Lauded' end." <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)
