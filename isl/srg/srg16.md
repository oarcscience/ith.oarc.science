# PART XII

## IDOLS, GIRDLES, AND CHRISTIANITY

ARE you still turning to great and small?  
Pondering on religion and piety,  
Teachership and discipleship?  
Which mean hypocrisy and bondage.  
Then idols and girdles  
And Christianity are still yours.

### IDOLS

THE idol's real being is not vain  
Because God created it,  
And all things from Him are good.  
Being is pure good, if it contains evil  
That comes from "other."  
Truth is idol-worship,  
If the Mussulman only knew;

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

But he sees in idols  
Only the visible creature,  
Not the Truth hidden in the idol.  
Idol-worship is unification,  
Since all things are the symbols of Being.

By counting beads, repeating prayers,  
And reading the Koran,  
The heathen becomes not a Mussulman.  
The man to whom true infidelity becomes revealed  
With pretended faith becomes disgusted.

Within every body a soul is hidden,  
And true faith conceals infidelity.

Who adorned the face of the idol  
With such beauty?  
And who becomes an idol-worshipper  
Unless God wills it?

In all things  
See but One, say One, know One,

### THE GIRDLE

THE mark of service  
Is the knotted girdle.  
So gird your loins, like a valiant man  
With manliness.  
Cast aside vain tales,  
And mystic states and visions;  
Dream not of lights,  
Of marvels, of miracles,  
For your miracles are contained  
In worshipping the Truth;  
All else is pride, conceit,  
And illusion of existence.

### CHRISTIANITY

I SEE the desire of Christianity  
Is purification from self,  
And liberty from bondage.

There is a sanctuary of the soul,  
The blessed portal of unity,  
The nest of the Eternal.  
God's Spirit (Jesus),  
Who proceeds from the blessed Spirit,  
Taught this doctrine.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

In you is placed a soul,  
Which is a sample of this blessed Spirit.  
Find release from humanity's carnal desire  
And you will enter the Divine Life.  
And he who is pure as the angels are  
Will be carried up to the fourth heaven.

### THE MOSQUE AND THE CLOISTER

IF "other" and "others" are before your eyes,  
Then a mosque is no better  
Than a Christian cloister;  
But when the garment of "other" is cast off by you,  
The cloister becomes a mosque.
