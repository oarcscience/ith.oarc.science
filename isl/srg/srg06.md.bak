# PART II

## BEAUTY

### THE MARRIAGE OF THE SOUL

DESCENDING to the earth,  
That strange intoxicating beauty of the unseen world  
Lurks in the elements of Nature.

And the soul of man,  
Who has attained the rightful balance,  
Becoming aware of this hidden joy,  
Straightway is enamoured and [bewitched](errata.htm#0.md).

And from this mystic marriage are born  
The poets' songs, inner knowledge,  
The language of the heart, virtuous living,  
And the fair child Beauty.

And the Great Soul gives to man as dowry  
The hidden glory of the world.

### THE CHARM OF BEAUTY

FROM the unseen world descends  
Heavenly beauty,  
And plants its flag in the city  
Of earthly fairness,  
Throwing the world's array into confusion;  
Now riding the steed of comeliness,  
Now flourishing the sword of eloquence,  
And all alike bow down,  
Saints and kings, dervishes and prophets,  
Swayed by the charm of Beauty's fascination.

### EARTHLY BEAUTY

WHENCE the charm of a fair face?  
Not earthly beauty only  
Can so allure us with its loveliness.  
Perchance we see in this, as in a cloudy mirror,  
The far faint reflect of the Perfect Face.  
And these deep feelings of delight and wonder  
Can only issue from the One True Beauty,  
For in Divine Perfection there is no other partner.  
Nor is it all desire and lust that tempts men's hearts with longing.  
. . . Evil appears but as the other side of Truth.
