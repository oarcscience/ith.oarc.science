### Sūra LXXVIII.

### *Nabaa,* or The (Great) News.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Concerning what  
Are they disputing?

2\. Concerning the Great News,

3\. About which they  
Cannot agree.

4\. Verily, they shall soon  
(Come to) know!

5\. Verily, verily they shall  
Soon (come to) know!

6\. Have We not made  
The earth as a wide  
Expanse,

7\. And the mountains as pegs?

<span id="page_1673">p. 1673</span>

8\. And (have We not) created  
You in pairs,

9\. And made your sleep  
For rest,

10\. And made the night  
As a covering,

11\. And made the day  
As a means of subsistence?

12\. And (have We not)  
Built over you  
The seven firmaments,

13\. And placed (therein)  
A Light of Splendour?

14\. And do We not send down  
From the clouds water  
In abundance,

15\. That We may produce  
Therewith corn and vegetables,

16\. And gardens of luxurious growth?

<span id="page_1674">p. 1674</span>

17\. Verily the Day  
Of Sorting Out  
Is a thing appointed,—

18\. The Day that the Trumpet  
Shall be sounded, and ye  
Shall come forth in crowds;

19\. And the heavens  
Shall be opened  
As if there were doors,

20\. And the mountains  
Shall vanish, as if  
They were a mirage.

21\. Truly Hell is  
As a place of ambush,—

22\. For the transgressors  
A place of destination:

23\. They will dwell therein  
For ages.

24\. Nothing cool shall they taste  
Therein, nor any drink,

25\. Save a boiling fluid  
And a fluid, dark, murky,  
Intensely cold,—

<span id="page_1675">p. 1675</span>

26\. A fitting recompense  
(For them).

27\. For that they used not  
To fear any account  
(For their deeds),

28\. But they (impudently) treated  
Our Signs as false.

29\. And all things have We  
Preserved on record.

30\. "So taste ye (the fruits  
Of your deeds);  
For no increase  
Shall We grant you,  
Except in Punishment.

##### SECTION 2.

31\. Verily for the Righteous  
There will be  
A fulfilment of  
(The Heart's) desires;

32\. Gardens enclosed, and Grapevines;

<span id="page_1676">p. 1676</span>

33\. Companions of Equal age;

34\. And a Cup full  
(To the brim).

35\. No Vanity shall they hear  
Therein, nor Untruth;—

36\. Recompense from thy Lord,  
A Gift, (amply) sufficient,—

37\. (From the Lord  
Of the heavens  
And the earth, and all between,—  
(God) Most Gracious:  
None shall have power  
To argue with Him.

<span id="page_1677">p. 1677</span>

38\. The Day that  
The Spirit and the angels  
Will stand forth in ranks,  
None shall speak  
Except any who is  
Permitted by (God) Most Gracious,  
And he will say  
What is right.

39\. that day will be  
The sure Reality:  
Therefore, whoso will let him  
Take a (straight) Return  
To his Lord!

40\. Verily, we have warned you  
Of a Penalty near,—  
The Day when man will  
See (the Deeds) which  
His hands have sent forth,  
And the Unbeliever will say,  
"Woe unto me! Would that  
I were mere dust!"
