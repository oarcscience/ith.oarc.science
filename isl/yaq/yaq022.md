### Sūra XXII.

### *Ḥajj,* or The Pilgrimage.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. O mankind! Fear your Lord!  
For the convulsion of the Hour  
(Of Judgment) will be  
A thing terrible!

2\. The Day ye shall see it,  
Every mother giving suck  
Shall forget her suckling-babe,  
And every pregnant female  
Shall drop her load (unformed):  
Thou shalt see mankind  
As in a drunken riot,  
Yet not drunk: but dreadful  
Will be the Wrath of God.

3\. And yet among men  
There are such as dispute  
About God, without knowledge,  
And follow every evil one  
Obstinate in rebellion!

4\. About the (Evil One)  
It is decreed that whoever  
Turns to him for friendship,  
Him will he lead astray,  
And he will guide him  
To the Penalty of the Fire.

<span id="page_851">p. 851</span>

5\. O mankind! if ye have  
A doubt about the Resurrection,  
(Consider) that We created you  
Out of dust, then out of  
Sperm, then out of a leech-like  
Clot, then out of a morsel  
Of flesh, partly formed  
And partly unformed, in order  
That We may manifest  
(Our power) to you;  
And We cause whom We will  
To rest in the wombs  
For an appointed term,  
Then do We bring you out  
As babes, then (foster you)  
That ye may reach your age  
Of full strength; and some  
Of you are called to die,  
And some are sent back  
To the feeblest old age,  
So that they know nothing  
After having known (much),  
And (further), thou seest  
The earth barren and lifeless,  
But when We pour down  
Rain on it, it is stirred  
(To life), it swells,  
And it puts forth every kind  
Of beautiful growth (in pairs).

<span id="page_852">p. 852</span>

6\. This is so, because God  
Is the Reality: it is He  
Who gives life to the dead,  
And it is He Who has  
Power over all things.

7\. And verily the Hour will come:  
There can be no doubt  
About it, or about (the fact)  
That God will raise up  
All who are in the graves.

8\. Yet there is among men  
Such a one as disputes  
About God, without knowledge,  
Without guidance, and without  
A Book of Enlightenment,—

9\. (Disdainfully) bending his side,  
In order to lead (men) astray  
From the Path of God:  
For him there is disgrace  
In this life, and on the Day  
Of Judgment We shall  
Make him taste the Penalty  
Of burning (Fire).

10\. (It will be said): "This is  
Because of the deeds which  
Thy hands sent forth,  
For verily God is not  
Unjust to His servants."

<span id="page_853">p. 853</span>

##### SECTION 2.

11\. There are among men  
Some who serve God,  
As it were, on the verge:  
If good befalls them, they are,  
Therewith, well content; but  
If a trial comes to them,  
They turn on their faces:  
They lose both this world  
And the Hereafter: that  
Is loss for all to see!

12\. They call on such deities:  
Besides God, as can neither  
Hurt nor profit them:  
That is straying far indeed  
(From the Way)!

13\. (Perhaps) they call on one  
Whose hurt is nearer  
Than his profit: evil, indeed,  
Is the patron, and evil  
The companion (for help)!

14\. Verily God will admit  
Those who believe and work  
Righteous deeds, to Gardens,  
Beneath which rivers flow:  
For God carries out  
All that He plans,

<span id="page_854">p. 854</span>

15\. If any think that God  
Will not help him  
(His Apostle) in this world  
And the Hereafter, let him  
Stretch out a rope  
To the ceiling and cut (himself)  
Off: then let him see  
Whether his plan will remove  
That which enrages (him)!

16\. Thus have We sent down  
Clear Signs; and verily  
God Both guide whom  
He will!

17\. Those who believe (in the Qur-ān),  
Those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),  
And the Sabians, Christians,  
Magians, and Polytheists,—  
God will judge between them

<span id="page_855">p. 855</span>

On the Day of Judgment:  
For God is witness  
Of all things.

18\. Seest thou not that  
To God bow down in worship  
All things that are  
In the heavens and on earth,—  
The sun, the moon, the stars;  
The hills, the trees, the animals;  
And a great number among  
Mankind? But a great number  
Are (also) such as are  
Fit for Punishment: and such  
As God shall disgrace,  
None can raise to honour:  
For God carries out  
All that He wills.

19\. These two antagonists dispute  
With each other about their Lord:  
But those who deny (their Lord),—  
For them will be cut out  
A garment of Fire:  
Over their heads will be  
Poured out boiling water.

20\. With it will be scalded  
What is within their bodies,  
As well as (their) skins.

21\. In addition there will be  
Maces of iron (to punish) them.

<span id="page_856">p. 856</span>

22\. Every time they wish  
To get away therefrom,  
From anguish, they will be  
Forced back therein, and  
(It will be said), "Taste ye  
The Penalty of Burning!"

##### SECTION 3.

23\. God will admit those  
Who believe and work righteous deeds,  
To Gardens beneath which  
Rivers flow: they shall be  
Adorned therein with bracelets  
Of gold and pearls; and  
Their garments there  
Will be of silk.

24\. For they have been guided  
(In this life) to the purest  
Of speeches; they have been  
Guided to the Path of Him  
Who is Worthy of (all) Praise.

25\. As to those who have rejected  
(God), and would keep back (men)  
From the Way of God, and  
From the Sacred Mosque, which  
We have made (open) to (all) men—  
Equal is the dweller there  
And the visitor from the country  
And any whose purpose therein  
Is profanity or wrong-doing—  
Them will We cause to taste  
Of a most grievous Penalty.

<span id="page_857">p. 857</span>

##### SECTION 4.

26\. Behold! We gave the site,  
To Abraham, of the (Sacred) House,  
(Saying): "Associate not anything  
(In worship) with Me;  
And sanctify My House  
For those who compass it round,  
Or stand up,  
Or bow, or prostrate themselves  
(Therein in prayer).

27\. "And proclaim the Pilgrimage  
Among men: they will come  
To thee on foot and (mounted)  
On every kind of camel,  
Lean on accout of journeys  
Through deep and distant  
Mountain highways;

28\. "That they may witness  
The benefits (provided) for them,

<span id="page_858">p. 858</span>

And celebrate the name  
Of God, through the Days  
Appointed, over the cattle  
Which He has provided for them  
(For sacrifice): then eat ye  
Thereof and feed the distressed  
Ones in want.

29\. "Then let them complete  
The rites prescribed  
For them, perform their vows,  
And (again) circumambulate  
The Ancient House."

30\. Such (is the Pilgrimage):  
Whoever honours the sacred  
Rites of God, for him  
It is good in the sight  
Of his Lord. Lawful to you  
(For food in Pilgrimage) are cattle,  
Except those mentioned to you  
(As exceptions): but shun  
The abomination of idols,  
And shun the word  
That is false,—

31\. Being true in faith to God,  
And never assigning partners

<span id="page_859">p. 859</span>

To Him: if anyone assigns  
Partners to God, he is  
As if he had fallen  
From heaven and been snatched up  
By birds, or the wind  
Had swooped (like a bird  
On its prey) and thrown him  
Into a far-distant place.

32\. Such (is his state): and  
Whoever holds in honour  
The Symbols of God,  
(In the sacrifice of animals),  
Such (honour) should come truly  
From piety of heart.

33\. In them ye have benefits  
For a term appointed:  
In the end their place  
Of sacrifice is near  
The Ancient House.

##### SECTION 5.

34\. To every people did We  
Appoint rites (of sacrifice),  
That they might celebrate  
The name of God over

<span id="page_860">p. 860</span>

The sustenance He gave them  
From animals (fit for food).  
But your god is One God:  
Submit then your wills to him  
(In Islām): and give thou  
The good news to those  
Who humble themselves,—

35\. To those whose hearts,  
When God is mentioned,  
Are filled with fear,  
Who show patient perseverance  
Over their afflictions, keep up  
Regular prayer, and spend  
(In charity) out of what  
We have bestowed upon them.

36\. The sacrificial camels  
We have made for you  
As among the symbols from  
God: in them is (much)  
Good for you: then pronounce  
The name of God over them  
As they line up (for sacrifice):  
When they are down  
On their sides (after slaughter),  
Eat ye thereof, and feed  
Such as (beg not but)  
Live in contentment,  
And such as beg  
With due humility: thus have

<span id="page_861">p. 861</span>

We made animals subject  
To you, that ye  
May be grateful.

37\. It is not their meat  
Nor their blood, that reaches  
God: it is your piety  
That reaches Him: He  
Has thus made them subject  
To you, that ye may glorify  
God for his guidance to you:  
And proclaim the Good News  
To all who do right.

38\. Verily God will defend  
(From ill) those who believe:  
Verily, God loveth not  
Any that is a traitor  
To faith, or shows ingratitude.

##### SECTION 6.

39\. To those against whom  
War is made, permission  
Is given (to fight), because  
They are wronged;—and verily,  
God is most Powerful  
For their aid;—

40\. (They are) those who have  
Been expelled from their homes

<span id="page_862">p. 862</span>

In defiance of right,  
(For no cause) except  
That they say," Lord  
Is God". Did not God  
Check one set of people  
By means of another,  
There would surely have been  
Pulled down monasteries, churches,  
Synagogues, and mosques, in which  
The name of God is commemorated  
In abundant measure. God will  
Certainly aid those who  
Aid His (cause);—for verily  
God is Full of Strength,  
Exalted in Might,  
(Able to enforce His Will).

41\. (They are) those who,  
If We establish them  
In the land, establish  
Regular prayer and give  
Regular charity, enjoin  
The right and forbid wrong:  
With God rests the end  
(And decision) of (all) affairs.

42\. If they treat thy (mission)  
As false, so did the Peoples

<span id="page_863">p. 863</span>

Before them (with their Prophets),—  
The People of Noah,  
And ’Ad and <u>Th</u>amūd;

43\. Those of Abraham and Lūt;

44\. And the Companions  
Of the Madyan people;  
And Moses was rejected  
(In the same way). But I  
Granted respite to the Unbelievers,  
And (only) after that  
Did I punish them:  
But how (terrible) was  
My rejection (of them)!

45\. How many populations have We  
Destroyed, which were given  
To wrong-doing? They tumbled down  
On their roofs. And how many  
Wells are lying idle and neglected,  
And castles lofty and well-built?

46\. Do they not travel  
Through the land, so that  
Their hearts (and minds)  
May thus learn wisdom

<span id="page_864">p. 864</span>

And their ears may  
Thus learn to hear?  
Truly it is not their eyes  
That are blind, but their  
Hearts which are  
In their breasts.

47\. Yet they ask thee  
To hasten on the Punishment!  
But God will not fail  
In His promise. Verily  
A Day in the sight of thy Lord  
Is like a thousand years  
Of your reckoning.

48\. And to how many populations  
Did I give respite, which  
Were given to wrong-doing?  
In the end I punished them.  
To Me is the destination (of all).

##### SECTION 7.

49\. Say: "O men! I am  
(Sent) to you only to give

<span id="page_865">p. 865</span>

A clear warning:

50\. "Those who believe and work  
Righteousness, for them  
Is forgiveness and a sustenance  
Most generous.

51\. "But those who strive  
Against Our Signs, to frustrate  
Them,—they will be  
Companions of the Fire."

52\. Never did We send  
An apostle or a prophet  
Before thee, but, when he  
Framed a desire, Satan  
Threw some (vanity)  
Into his desire: but God  
Will cancel anything (vain)  
That Satan throws in,  
And God will confirm  
(And establish) His Signs:  
For God is full of knowledge  
And wisdom:

53\. That He may make  
The suggestions thrown in  
By Satan, but a trial  
For those in whose hearts

<span id="page_866">p. 866</span>

[Is](errata.htm#4.md) a disease and who are  
Hardened of heart: verily  
The wrong-doers are in a schism  
Far (from the Truth):

54\. And that those on whom  
Knowledge has been bestowed may learn  
That the (Qur-ān) is the Truth  
From thy Lord, and that they  
May believe therein, and their hearts  
May be made humbly (open)  
To it: for verily God is  
The Guide of those who believe,  
To the Straight Way.

55\. Those who reject Faith  
Will not cease to be  
In doubt concerning (Revelation)  
Until the Hour (of Judgment)  
Comes suddenly upon them,  
Or there comes to them  
The Penalty of a Day of Disaster.

56\. On that Day the Dominion  
Will be that of God:  
He will judge between them:  
So those who believe  
And work righteous deeds will be  
In Gardens of Delight.

57\. And for those who reject Faith  
And deny Our Signs,  
There will be a humiliating  
Punishment.

<span id="page_867">p. 867</span>

##### SECTION 8.

58\. Those who leave their homes  
In the cause of God,  
And are then slain or die,  
On them will God bestow verily  
A goodly Provision:  
Truly God is He Who  
Bestows the best Provision.

59\. Verily He will admit then  
To a place with which  
They shall be well pleased:  
For God is All-Knowing,  
Most Forbearing.

60\. That (is so). And if one  
Has retaliated to no greater  
Extent than the injury he received,  
And is again set upon  
Inordinately, God will help  
Him: for God is One  
That blots out (sins)  
And forgives (again and again).

61\. What is because God merges  
Night into Day, and He  
Merges Day into Night, and  
Verily it is God Who hears

<span id="page_868">p. 868</span>

And sees (all things).

62\. That is because God—He  
Is the Reality; and those  
Besides Him whom they invoke,—  
They are but vain Falsehood:  
Verily God is He, Most High,  
Most Great.

63\. Seest thou not that God  
Sends down rain from the sky,  
And forthwith the earth  
Becomes clothed with green?  
For God is He Who understands  
The finest mysteries, and  
Is well-acquainted (with them).

64\. To Him belongs all that is  
In the heavens and on earth:  
For verily God,—He is  
Free of all wants,  
Worthy of all praise.

<span id="page_869">p. 869</span>

##### SECTION 9.

65\. Seest thou not that God  
Has made subject to you (men)  
All that is on the earth,  
And the ships that sail  
Through the sea by His command?  
He withholds the sky (rain)  
From falling on the earth  
Except by His leave:  
For God is Most Kind  
And Most Merciful to man.

66\. It is He Who gave you life,  
Will cause you to die,  
And will again give you  
Life: truly man is  
A most ungrateful creature!

67\. To every People have We  
Appointed rites and ceremonies  
Which they must follow:  
Let them not then dispute  
With thee on the matter,  
But do thou invite (them)  
To thy Lord: for thou art  
Assuredly on the Right Way.

68\. If they do wrangle with thee,  
Say, "God knows best  
What it is ye are doing."

<span id="page_870">p. 870</span>

69\. "God will judge between you  
On the Day of Judgment  
Concerning the matters in which  
Ye differ."

70\. Knowest thou not that  
God knows all that is  
In heaven and on earth?  
Indeed it is all  
In a record, and that  
Is easy for God.

71\. Yet they worship, besides God,  
Things for which no authority  
Has been sent down to them,  
And of which they have  
(Really) no knowledge:  
For those that do wrong  
There is no helper.

72\. When Our Clear Signs  
Are rehearsed to them,  
Thou wilt notice a denial  
On the faces of the Unbelievers!  
They nearly attack with violence  
Those who rehearse Our Signs  
To them. Say, "Shall I  
Tell you of something  
(Far) worse than these Signs?  
It is the Fire (of Hell)!

<span id="page_871">p. 871</span>

God has promised it  
To the Unbelievers!  
And evil is that destination!"

##### SECTION 10.

73\. O men! Here is  
A parable set forth!  
Listen to it! Those  
On whom, besides God,  
Ye call, cannot create  
(Even) a fly, if they all  
Met together for the purpose!  
And if the fly should snatch  
Away anything from them,  
They would have no power  
To release it from the fly.  
Feeble are those who petition  
And those whom they petition!

74\. No just estimate have they  
Made of God: for God  
Is He Who is strong  
And able to carry out  
His Will.

75\. God chooses Messengers  
From angels and from men  
For God is He Who hears  
And sees (all things).

76\. He knows what is before them  
And what is behind them:

<span id="page_872">p. 872</span>

And to God go back  
All questions (for decision).

77\. O ye who believe!  
Bow down, prostrate yourselves,  
And adore your Lord;  
And do good;  
That ye may prosper.

78\. And strive in His cause  
As ye ought to strive,  
(With sincerity and under discipline).  
He has chosen you, and has  
Imposed no difficulties on you  
In religion; it is the cult  
Of your father Abraham.  
It is He Who has named  
You Muslims, both before  
And in this (Revelation);  
That the Apostle may be  
A witness for you, and ye  
Be witnesses for mankind!  
So establish regular Prayer,  
Give regular Charity,  
And hold fast to God!  
He is your Protector—  
The best to protect  
And the Best to help!
