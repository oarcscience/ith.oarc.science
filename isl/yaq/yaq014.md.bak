### Sūra XIV.

### *Ibrāhīm,* or Abraham.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious  
Most Merciful.*

1\. A. L. R. A Book  
Which We have revealed  
Unto thee, in order that  
Thou mightest lead mankind  
Out of the depths of darkness  
Into light—by the leave  
Of their Lord—to the Way  
Of (Him) the Exalted in Power,  
Worthy of all Praise!—

2\. Of God, to Whom do belong  
All things in the heavens  
And on earth!  
But alas for the Unbelievers  
For a terrible Penalty  
(Their Unfaith will bring them)!—

3\. Those who love the life  
Of this world more than  
The Hereafter, who hinder (men)  
From the Path of God  
And seek therein something crooked:  
They are astray  
By a long distance.

<span id="page_620">p. 620</span>

4\. We sent not an apostle  
Except (to teach) in the language  
Of his (own) people, in order  
To make (things) clear to them.  
Now God leaves straying  
Those whom He pleases  
And guides whom He pleases:  
And He is Exalted in Power,  
Full of Wisdom.

5\. We sent Moses with Our Signs  
(And the command). "Bring out  
Thy people from the depths  
Of darkness into light,  
And teach them to remember  
The Days of God." Verily  
In this there are Signs  
For such as are firmly patient  
And constant,—grateful and appreciative.

6\. Remember! Moses said  
To his people: "Call to mind  
The favour of God to you  
When He delivered you

<span id="page_621">p. 621</span>

From the people of Pharaoh:  
They set you hard tasks  
And punishments, slaughtered  
Your sons, and let your women-folk  
Live: therein was  
A tremendous trial from your Lord."

##### SECTION 2.

7\. And remember! your Lord  
Caused to be declared (publicly):  
"If ye are grateful, I will  
Add more (favours) unto you;  
But if ye show ingratitude,  
Truly my punishment  
Is terrible indeed."

8\. And Moses said: "If ye  
Show ingratitude, ye and all  
On earth together,—yet  
Is God Free of all wants,  
Worthy of all praise.

9\. Has not the story  
Reached you, (O people!), of those  
Who (went) before you?—  
Of the People of Noah,  
And ’Ād, and <u>Th</u>amūd?—  
And of those who (came)  
After them? None knows them  
But God. To them came

<span id="page_622">p. 622</span>

Apostles with Clear (Signs);  
But they put their hands  
Up to their mouths, and said:  
"We do deny (the mission)  
On which ye have been sent,  
And we are really  
In suspicious (disquieting) doubt  
As to that to which  
Ye invite us."

10\. Their apostles said: "Is there  
A doubt about God,  
The Creator of the heavens  
And the earth? It is He  
Who invites you, in order  
That He may forgive you  
Your sins and give you  
Respite for a term appointed!"  
They said: "Ah! ye are  
No more than human,  
Like ourselves! Ye wish  
To turn us away from  
The (gods) our fathers  
Used to worship: then  
Bring us some clear authority."

11\. Their apostles said to them:  
"True, we are human  
Like yourselves, but God  
Doth grant His grace

<span id="page_623">p. 623</span>

To such of His servants  
As He pleases. It is not  
For us to bring you  
An authority except as God  
Permits. And on God  
Let all men of faith  
Put their trust.

12\. "No reason have we why  
We should not put our trust  
On God. Indeed He  
Has guided us to the Ways  
We (follow). We shall certainly  
Bear with patience all  
The hurt you may cause us.  
For those who put their trust  
Should put their trust on God."

##### SECTION 3.

13\. And the Unbelievers said  
To their apostles: "Be sure  
We shall drive you out  
Of our land, or ye shall  
Return to our religion."  
But their Lord inspired  
(This Message) to them:  
"Verily We shall cause  
The wrong-doers to perish!

14\. "And verily We shall  
Cause you to abide  
In the land, and succeed them.  
This for such as fear  
The Time when they shall stand  
Before My tribunal,—such  
As fear the Punishment denounced."

<span id="page_624">p. 624</span>

15\. But they sought victory and decision  
(There and then), and frustration  
Was the lot of every  
Powerful obstinate transgressor.

16\. In front of such a one  
Is Hell, and he is given,  
For drink, boiling fetid water.

17\. In gulps will he sip it,  
But never will he be near  
Swallowing it down his throat:  
Death will come to him  
From every quarter, yet  
Will he not die: and  
In front of him will be  
A chastisement unrelenting.

18\. The parable of those who  
Reject their Lord is that  
Their works are as ashes,  
On which the wind blows  
Furiously on a tempestuous day:  
No power have they over  
Aught that they have earned:  
That is the straying  
Far, far (from the goal).

<span id="page_625">p. 625</span>

19\. Seest thou not that God  
Created the heavens and the earth  
In Truth? If He so will,  
He can remove you  
And put (in your place)  
A new Creation?

20\. Nor is that for God  
Any great matter.

21\. They will all be marshalled  
Before God together: then  
Will the weak say to those  
Who were arrogant, "For us,  
We but followed you; can ye  
Then avail us at all  
Against the Wrath of God?"  
They will reply, "If we  
Had received the guidance  
Of God, we should have  
Given it to you: to us  
It makes no difference (now)  
Whether we rage, or bear  
(These torments) with patience:  
For ourselves there is no way  
Of escape."

##### SECTION 4.

22\. And Satan will say  
When the matter is decided:  
"It was God Who gave you  
A promise of Truth: I too  
Promised, but I failed  
In my promise to you.

<span id="page_626">p. 626</span>

I had no authority over you  
Except to call you, but ye  
Listened to me: then  
Reproach not me, but reproach  
Your own souls. I cannot listen  
To your cries, nor can ye  
Listen to mine. I reject  
Your former act in associating  
Me with God.  
For wrong-doers there must be  
A grievous Penalty."

23\. But those who believe  
And work righteousness  
Will be admitted to Gardens  
Beneath which rivers flow,—  
To dwell therein for aye  
With the leave of their Lord.  
Their greeting therein  
Will be: "Peace!"

24\. Seest thou not how  
God sets forth a parable?—  
A goodly Word  
Like a goodly tree,  
Whose root is firmly fixed,  
And its branches (reach)  
To the heavens,—

25\. It brings forth its fruit  
At all times, by the leave

<span id="page_627">p. 627</span>

Of its Lord.  
So God sets forth parables  
For men, in order that  
They may receive admonition.

26\. And the parable  
Of an evil Word  
Is that of an evil tree:  
It is torn up by the root  
From the surface of the earth:  
It has no stability.

27\. God will establish in strength  
Those who believe, with the Word  
That stands firm, in this world  
And in the Hereafter; but God  
Will leave, to stray, those  
Who do wrong: God doeth  
What He willeth.

<span id="page_628">p. 628</span>

##### SECTION 5.

28, Hast thou not turned  
Thy vision to those who  
Have changed the favour of God.  
Into blasphemy and caused  
Their people to descend  
To the House of Perdition?—

29\. Into Hell? They will burn  
Therein,—an evil place  
To stay in!

30\. And they set up (idols)  
As equal to God, to mislead  
(Men) from the Path! Say:  
"Enjoy (your brief power)!  
But verily ye are making  
Straightway for Hell!"

31\. Speak to my servants  
Who have believed,  
That they may establish  
Regular prayers, and spend  
(In charity) out of the Sustenance

<span id="page_629">p. 629</span>

We have given them,  
Secretly and openly, before  
The coming of a Day  
In which there will be  
Neither mutual bargaining  
Nor befriending.

32\. It is God Who hath created  
The heavens and the earth  
And sendeth down rain  
From the skies, and with it  
Bringeth out fruits wherewith  
To feed you; it is He  
Who hath made the ships subject  
To you, that they may sail  
Through the sea by His Command;  
And the rivers (also)  
Hath He made subject to you.

33\. And He hath made subject  
To you the sun and the moon,  
Both diligently pursuing  
Their courses; and the Night  
And the Day hath He (also)  
Made subject to you.

<span id="page_630">p. 630</span>

34\. And He giveth you  
Of all that ye ask for.  
But if ye count the favours  
Of God, never will ye  
Be able to number them.  
Verily, man is given up  
To injustice and ingratitude.

##### SECTION 6.

35\. Remember Abraham said:  
"O my Lord! make this city  
One of peace and security:  
And preserve me and my sons  
From worshipping idols.

36\. "O my Lord! they have indeed  
Led astray many among mankind;  
He then who follows my (ways)  
Is of me, and he that  
Disobeys me,—but Thou  
Art indeed Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

37\. "O our Lord! I have made  
Some of my offspring to dwell  
In a valley without cultivation,  
By Thy Sacred House;

<span id="page_631">p. 631</span>

In order, O our Lord, that they  
May establish regular Prayer:  
So till the hearts of some  
Among men with love towards them,  
And feed them with Fruits:  
So that they may give thanks.

38\. "O our Lord! truly Thou  
Dost know what we conceal  
And what we reveal:  
For nothing whatever is hidden  
From God, whether on earth  
Or in heaven.

39\. "Praise be to God, Who hath  
Granted unto me in old age  
Ismā’īl and Isaac: for truly  
My Lord is He, the Hearer  
Of Prayer!

40\. "O my Lord! make me  
One who establishes regular Prayer,  
And also (raise such)  
Among my offspring  
O our Lord!  
And accept Thou my Prayer.

41\. "O our Lord! cover (us)  
With Thy Forgiveness—me,

<span id="page_632">p. 632</span>

My parents, and (all) Believers,  
On the Day that the Reckoning  
Will be established!

##### SECTION 7.

42\. Think not that God  
Doth not heed the deeds  
Of those who do wrong.  
He but giveth them respite  
Against a Day when  
The eyes will fixedly stare  
In horror,—

43\. They running forward  
With necks outstretched,  
Their heads uplifted, their gaze  
Returning not towards them,  
And their hearts a (gaping) void!

44\. So warn mankind  
Of the Day when the Wrath  
Will reach them: then will  
The wrong-doers say: "Our Lord!  
Respite us (if only)  
For a short Term: we will  
Answer Thy Call, and follow  
The apostles!"  
"What! were ye not wont  
To swear aforetime that ye  
Should suffer no decline?

<span id="page_633">p. 633</span>

45\. "And ye dwelt in the dwellings  
Of men who wronged their own  
Souls; ye were clearly shown  
How We dealt with them;  
And We put forth (many) Parables  
In your behoof!"

46\. Mighty indeed were the plots  
Which they made, but their plots  
Were (well) within the sight  
Of God, even though they were  
Such as to shake the hills!

47\. Never think that God would fail  
His apostles in His promise:  
For God is Exalted in Power,—  
The Lord of Retribution.

48\. One day the Earth will be  
Changed to a different Earth,  
And so will be the Heavens,  
And (men) will be marshalled  
Forth, before God, the One,  
The Irresistible;

49\. And thou wilt see  
The Sinners that day  
Bound together in fetters;—

50\. Their garments of liquid pitch,  
And their faces covered with Fire;

<span id="page_634">p. 634</span>

51\. That God may requite  
Each soul according  
To its deserts;  
And verily God is Swift  
In calling to account.

52\. Here is a Message for mankind:  
Let them take warning therefrom,  
And let them know that He  
Is (no other than) One God  
Let men of understanding  
Take heed.
