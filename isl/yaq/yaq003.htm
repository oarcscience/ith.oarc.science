<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i>.</p>  
<p>1. A. L. M.</p>  
<p>2. God! There is no god<br> But He,&#8212;the Living,<br> The Self-Subsisting, Eternal.</p>  
<p>3. It is He Who sent down<br> To thee (step by step),<br> In truth, the Book,<br> Confirming what went before it;<br> And He sent down the Law<br> (Of Moses) and the Gospel<br> (Of Jesus) before this,<br> As a guide to mankind,<br> And He sent down the Criterion<br> (Of judgment between right and wrong).</p>  
<p>4. Then those who reject<br> Faith in the Signs of God<br> Will suffer the severest<br> Penalty, and God<br> Is Exalted in Might,<br> Lord of Retribution.</p>  
<p>5. From God, verily<br> Nothing is hidden<br> On earth or in the heavens.</p>  
<p>6. He it is Who shapes you<br> In the wombs as He pleases.</p>  
<p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></A></p>  
<p>There is no god but He,<br> The Exalted in Might,<br> The Wise.</p>  
<p>7. He it is Who has sent down<br> To thee the Book:<br> In it are verses<br> Basic or fundamental<br> (Of established meaning);<br> They are the foundation<br> Of the Book: others<br> Are allegorical. But those<br> In whose hearts is perversity follow<br> The part thereof that is allegorical,<br> Seeking discord, and searching<br> For its hidden meanings,<br> But &#7789;o one knows<br> Its hidden meanings except God.<br> And those who are firmly grounded<br> In knowledge say: "We believe<br> In the Book; the whole of it<br> Is from our Lord:" and none<br> Will grasp the Message<br> Except men of understanding.</p>  
<p>8. "Our Lord!" (they say),<br> "Let not our hearts deviate<br> Now after Thou hast guided us,<br> But grant us mercy<br> From Thine own Presence;<br> For Thou art the Grantor<br> Of bounties without measure.</p>  
<p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></A></p>  
<p>9. "Our Lord! Thou art He<br> That will gather mankind<br> Together against a Day about which<br> There is no doubt; for God<br> Never fails in His promise."</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>10. Whose who reject Faith,&#8212;<br> Neither their possessions<br> Nor their (numerous) progeny<br> Will avail them aught<br> Against God: they are themselves<br> But fuel for the Fire.</p>  
<p>11. (Their plight will be)<br> No better than that<br> Of the people of Pharaoh,<br> And their predecessors:<br> They denied our Signs,<br> And God called them to account<br> For their sins.<br> For God is strict<br> In punishment.</p>  
<p>12. Say to those who reject Faith:<br> "Soon will ye be vanquished<br> And gathered together<br> To Hell,&#8212;an evil bed<br> Indeed (to lie on)!</p>  
<p>13. "There has already been<br> For you a Sign</p>  
<p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></A></p>  
<p>In the two armies<br> That met (in combat):<br> One was fighting in the Cause<br> Of God, the other<br> Resisting God; these saw<br> With their own eyes<br> Twice their number.<br> But God doth support<br> With His aid whom He pleaseth.<br> In this is a warning<br> For such as have eyes to see."</p>  
<p>14. Fair in the eyes of men<br> Is the love of things they covet:<br> Women and sons;<br> Heaped-up hoards<br> Of gold and silver; horses<br> Branded (for blood and excellence);<br> And (wealth of) cattle<br> And well-tilled land.<br> Such are the possessions<br> Of this world's life;<br> But in nearness to God<br> Is the best of the goals<br> (To return to).</p>  
<p>15. Say: Shall I give you<br> Glad tidings of things<br> Far better than those?<br> For the righteous are Gardens</p>  
<p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></A></p>  
<p>In nearness to their Lord,<br> With rivers flowing beneath;<br> Therein is their eternal home;<br> With Companions pure (and holy);<br> And the good pleasure of God.<br> For in God's sight<br> Are (all) His servants,&#8212;</p>  
<p>16. (Namely), those who say:<br> "Our Lord! we have indeed<br> Believed: forgive us, then,<br> Our sins, and save us<br> From the agony of the Fire;"&#8212;</p>  
<p>17. Those who show patience,<br> Firmness and self control;<br> Who are true (in word and deed);<br> Who worship devoutly;<br> Who spend (in the way of God);<br> And who pray for forgiveness<br> In the early hours of the morning.</p>  
<p>18. There is no god but He<br> That is the witness of God,<br> His angels, and those endued<br> With knowledge, standing firm<br> On justice. There is no god but He,<br> The Exalted in Power,<br> The Wise.</p>  
<p>19. The Religion before God<br> Is Islam (submission to His Will):<br> Nor did the People of the Book<br> Dissent therefrom except</p>  
<p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 127</font></A></p>  
<p>Through envy of each other,<br> After knowledge had come to them.<br> But if any deny the Signs of God,<br> God is swift in calling to account.</p>  
<p>20. So if they dispute with thee,<br> Say: "I have submitted<br> My whole self to God<br> And so have those<br> Who follow me."<br> And say to the People of the Book<br> And to those who are unlearned:<br> "Do ye (also) submit yourselves?"<br> If they do, they are in right guidance,<br> But if they turn back,<br> Thy duty is to convey the Message;<br> And in God's sight<br> Are (all) His servants.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>21. As to those who deny<br> The Signs of God, and in defiance</p>  
<p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></A></p>  
<p>Of right, slay the prophets,<br> And slay those who teach<br> Just dealing whith mankind,<br> Announce to them a grievous penalty.</p>  
<p>22. They are those whose works<br> Will bear no fruit<br> In this world<br> And in the Hereafter,<br> Nor will they have<br> Anyone to help.</p>  
<p>23. Hast thou not turned<br> Thy vision to those<br> Who have been given a portion<br> Of the Book? They are<br> Invited to the Book of God,<br> To settle their dispute,<br> But a party of them<br> Turn back and decline<br> (The arbitration).</p>  
<p>24. This because they say:<br> "The Fire shall not touch us<br> But for a few numbered days":<br> For their forgeries deceive them<br> As to their own religion.</p>  
<p>25. But how (will they fare)<br> When We gather them together</p>  
<p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></A></p>  
<p>Against a Day about which<br> There is no doubt,<br> And each soul will be paid out<br> Just what it has earned,<br> Without (favour or) injustice?</p>  
<p>26. Say: "O God!<br> Lord of Power (and Rule),<br> Thou givest Power<br> To whom Thou pleasest,<br> And Thou strippest off Power<br> From whom Thou pleasest:<br> Thou enduest with honour<br> Whom Thou pleasest,<br> And Thou bringest low<br> Whom Thou pleasest:<br> In Thy hand is all Good."<br> Verily, over all things<br> Thou hast power.</p>  
<p>27. "Thou causest the Night<br> To gain on the Day,<br> And Thou causest the Day<br> To gain on the Night;<br> Thou bringest the Living<br> Out of the Dead,<br> And Thou bringest the Dead<br> Out of the Living;<br> And Thou givest sustenance<br> To whom Thou pleasest,<br> Without measure."</p>  
<p>28. let not the Believers<br> Take for friends or helpers</p>  
<p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></A></p>  
<p>Unbelievers rather than<br> Believers: if any do that,<br> In nothing will there be help<br> From God: except by way<br> Of precaution, that ye may<br> Guard yourselves from them,<br> But God cautions you<br> (To remember) Himself;<br> For the final goal<br> Is to God.</p>  
<p>29. Say: "Whether ye hide<br> What is in your hearts<br> Or reveal it,<br> God knows it all:<br> He knows what is<br> In the heavens,<br> And what is on earth.<br> And God has power<br> Over all things.</p>  
<p>30. "On the Day when every soul<br> Will be confronted<br> With all the good it has done,<br> And all the evil it has done,<br> It will wish there were<br> A great distance<br> Between it and its evil.<br> But God cautions you<br> (To remember) Himself.<br> And God is full of kindness<br> To those that serve Him."</p>  
<p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
<p>31. Say: "If ye do love God,<br> Follow me: God will love you<br> And forgive you your sins:<br> For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful."</p>  
<p>32. Say: "Obey God<br> And His Apostle":<br> But if they turn back,<br> God loveth not those<br> Who reject Faith.</p>  
<p>33. God did choose<br> Adam and Noah, the family<br> Of Abraham, and the family<br> Of &#8217;Imr&#257;n above all people,&#8212;</p>  
<p>34. Offspring, one of the other:<br> And God heareth<br> And knoweth all things.</p>  
<p>35. Behold! a woman of &#8217;Imr&#257;n<br> Said: "O my Lord! I do</p>  
<p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A></p>  
<p>Dedicate unto Thee<br> What is in my womb<br> For Thy special service:<br> So accept this of me:<br> For Thou hearest<br> And knowest all things."</p>  
<p>36. When she was delivered,<br> She said: "O my Lord!<br> Behold! I am delivered<br> Of a female child!"&#8212;<br> And God knew best<br> What she brought forth&#8212;<br> "And nowise is the male<br> Like the female.<br> I have named her Mary,<br> And I commend her<br> And her offspring<br> To Thy protection<br> From the Evil One,<br> The Rejected."</p>  
<p>37. Right graciously<br> Did her Lord accept her:<br> He made her grow<br> In purity and beauty:<br> To the care of Zakar&#299;ya<br> Was she assigned.<br> Every time that he entered<br> (Her) chamber to see her,<br> He found her supplied<br> With sustenance. He said:<br> "O Mary! Whence (comes) this<br> To you?" She said:<br> "From God: for God<br> Provides sustenance<br> To whom He pleases,<br> Without measure."</p>  
<p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A></p>  
<p>38. There here did Zakar&#299;ya<br> Pray to his Lord, saying:<br> "O my Lord! Grant unto me<br> From Thee a progeny<br> That is pure: for Thou<br> Art He that heareth prayer!</p>  
<p>39. While he was standing<br> In prayer in the chamber,<br> The angels called unto him:<br> "God doth give thee<br> Glad tidings of Ya&#7717;y&#257;,<br> Witnessing the truth<br> Of a Word from God, and (be<br> Besides) noble, chaste,<br> And a Prophet,<br> Of the (goodly) company<br> Of the righteous."</p>  
<p>40. He said: "O my Lord!<br> How shall I have a son,<br> Seeing I am very old,<br> And my wife is barren?"<br> "Thus, "was the answer,<br> "Doth God accomplish<br> What He willeth,"</p>  
<p>41. He said: "O my Lord!<br> Give me a Sign!"<br> "Thy Sign, "was the answer,<br> "Shall be that thou<br> Shalt speak to no man<br> For three days<br> But with signals.<br> Then celebrate<br> The praises of thy Lord<br> Again and again,<br> And glorify Him<br> In the evening<br> And in the morning."</p>  
<p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
<p>42. Behold! the angels said:<br> "O Mary! God hath chosen thee<br> And purified thee&#8212;chosen thee<br> Above the women of all nations.</p>  
<p>43. "O Mary! worship<br> Thy Lord devoutly:<br> Prostrate thyself,<br> And bow down (in prayer)<br> With those who bow down."</p>  
<p>44. This is part of the tidings<br> Of the things unseen,<br> Which We reveal unto thee<br> (O Apostle!) by inspiration:<br> Thou wast not with them<br> When they cast lots<br> With arrows, as to which<br> Of them should be charged<br> With the care of Mary:<br> Nor wast thou with them<br> When they disputed (the point).</p>  
<p>45. Behold! the angels said:<br> "O Mary! God giveth thee<br> Glad tidings of a Word<br> From Him: his name<br> Will be Christ Jesus,<br> The son of Mary, held in honour<br> In this world and the Hereafter<br> And of (the company of) those<br> Nearest to God;</p>  
<p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A></p>  
<p>46. "He shall speak to the people<br> In childhood and in maturity.<br> And he shall be (of the company)<br> Of the righteous."</p>  
<p>47. She said: "O my Lord!<br> How shall I have a son<br> When no man hath touched me?"<br> He said: "Even so:<br> God createth<br> What He willeth:<br> When He hath decreed<br> A Plan, He but saith<br> To it, 'Be,' and it is!</p>  
<p>48. "And God will teach him<br> The Book and Wisdom,<br> The Law and the Gospel,</p>  
<p>49. "And (appoint him)<br> An apostle to the Children<br> Of Israel, (with this message):<br> "'I have come to you,<br> With a Sign from your Lord,<br> In that I make for you<br> Out of clay, as it were,<br> The figure of a bird,<br> And breathe into it,<br> And it becomes a bird<br> By God's leave:<br> And I heal those<br> Born blind, and the lepers,<br> And I quicken the dead,<br> By God's leave;<br> And I declare to you<br> What ye eat, and what ye store<br> In your houses. Surely<br> Therein is a Sign for you<br> If ye did believe;</p>  
<p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></A></p>  
<p>50. "'(I have come to you),<br> To attest the Law<br> Which was before me.<br> And to make lawful<br> To you part of what was<br> (Before) forbidden to you;<br> I have come to you<br> With a Sign from your Lord.<br> So fear God,<br> And obey me.</p>  
<p>51. "'It is God<br> Who is my Lord<br> And your Lord;<br> Then worship Him.<br> This is a Way<br> That is straight.'"</p>  
<p>52. When Jesus found<br> Unbelief on their part<br> He said: "Who will be<br> My helpers to (the work<br> Of) God?" Said the Disciples:<br> "We are God's helpers:<br> We believe in God,<br> And do thou bear witness<br> That we are Muslims.</p>  
<p>53. "Our Lord! we believe<br> In what Thou hast revealed,<br> And we follow the Apostle;<br> Then write us down<br> Among those who bear witness."</p>  
<p>54. And (the unbelievers)<br> Plotted and planned,<br> And God too planned,<br> And the best of planners<br> Is God.</p>  
<p><a name="page_137"><font size="1" color="green">p. 137</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
<p>55. Behold! God said:<br> "O Jesus! I will take thee<br> And raise thee to Myself<br> And clear thee (of the falsehoods)<br> Of those who blaspheme;<br> I will make those<br> Who follow thee superior<br> To those who reject faith,<br> To the Day of Resurrection:<br> Then shall ye all<br> Return unto me,<br> And I will judge<br> Between you of the matters<br> Wherein ye dispute.</p>  
<p>56. "As to those who reject faith,<br> I will punish them<br> With terrible agony<br> In this world and in the Hereafter,<br> Nor will they have<br> Anyone to help.</p>  
<p>57. "As to those who believe<br> And work righteousness,<br> God will pay them (in full)<br> Their reward;<br> But God loveth not<br> Those who do wrong.</p>  
<p>58. "This is what we rehearse<br> Unto thee of the Signs<br> And the Message<br> Of Wisdom."</p>  
<p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></A></p>  
<p>59. The similitude of Jesus<br> Before God is as that of Adam;<br> He created him from dust,<br> Then said to him, "Be":<br> And he was.</p>  
<p>60. The Truth (comes)<br> From God alone;<br> So be not of those<br> Who doubt.</p>  
<p>61. If any one disputes<br> In this matter with thee,<br> Now after (full) knowledge<br> Hath come to thee,<br> Say: "Come! let us<br> Gather together,<br> Our sons and your sons,<br> Our women and your women,<br> Ourselves and yourselves:<br> Then let us earnestly pray,<br> And invoke the curse<br> Of God on those who lie!"</p>  
<p>62. This is the true account:<br> There is no god<br> Except God;<br> And God&#8212;He is indeed</p>  
<p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></A></p>  
<p>The Exalted in Power,<br> The Wise.</p>  
<p>63. But if they turn back,<br> God hath full knowledge<br> Of those who do mischief.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
<p>64. Say: "O People<br> Of the Book! come<br> To common terms<br> As between us and you:<br> That we worship<br> None but God;<br> That we associate<br> No partners with Him;<br> That we erect not,<br> From among ourselves,<br> Lords and patrons<br> Other than God."<br> If then they turn back,<br> Say ye: "Bear witness<br> That we (at least)<br> Are Muslims (bowing<br> To God's Will)."</p>  
<p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></A></p>  
<p>65. Ye People of the Book!<br> Why dispute ye<br> About Abraham,<br> When the Law and the Gospel<br> Were not revealed<br> Till after him?<br> Have ye no understanding?</p>  
<p>66. Ah! Ye are those<br> Who fell to disputing<br> (Even) in matters of which<br> Ye had some knowledge!<br> But why dispute ye<br> In matters of which<br> Ye have no knowledge?<br> It is God Who knows,<br> And ye who know not!</p>  
<p>67. Abraham was not a Jew<br> Nor yet a Christian;<br> But he was true in Faith,<br> And bowed his will to God's,<br> (Which is Islam),<br> And he joined not gods with God.</p>  
<p>68. Without doubt, among men,<br> The nearest of kin to Abraham,<br> Are those who follow him,<br> As are also this Apostle<br> And those who believe:<br> And God is the Protector<br> Of those who have faith.</p>  
<p>69. It is the wish of a section<br> Of the People of the Book<br> To lead you astray.<br> But they shall lead astray<br> (Not you), but themselves,<br> And they do not perceive!</p>  
<p>70. Ye People of the Book!<br> Why reject ye</p>  
<p><a name="page_141"><font size="1" color="green">p. 141</font></A></p>  
<p>The Signs of God,<br> Of which ye are<br> (Yourselves) witnesses?</p>  
<p>71. Ye People of the Book!<br> Why do ye clothe<br> Truth with falsehood,<br> And conceal the Truth,<br> While ye have knowledge?</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 8.</h5>  
<p>72. A section of the People<br> Of the Book say:<br> "Believe in the morning<br> What is revealed<br> To the Believers,<br> But reject it at the end<br> Of the day; perchance<br> They may (themselves)<br> Turn back;</p>  
<p>73. "And believe no one<br> Unless he follows<br> Your religion."<br> Say: "True guidance<br> Is the guidance of God:<br> (Fear ye) lest a revelation<br> Be sent to someone (else)<br> Like unto that which was sent<br> Unto you? Or that those<br> (Receiving such revelation)<br> Should engage you in argument<br> Before your Lord?"<br> Say: "All bounties<br> Are in the hand of God:<br> He granteth them<br> To whom He pleaseth:</p>  
<p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></A></p>  
<p>And God careth for all,<br> And He knoweth all things."</p>  
<p>74. For His Mercy He specially chooseth<br> Whom He pleaseth;<br> For God is the Lord<br> Of bounties unbounded.</p>  
<p>75. Among the People of the Book<br> Are some who, if entrusted<br> With a hoard of gold,<br> Will (readily) pay it back;<br> Others, who, if entrusted<br> With a single silver coin,<br> Will not repay it unless<br> Thou constantly stoodest<br> Demanding, because,<br> They say, "there is no call<br> On us (to keep faith)<br> With these ignorant (Pagans)."<br> But they tell a lie against God,<br> And (well) they know it.</p>  
<p>76. Nay.&#8212;Those that keep<br> Their plighted faith<br> And act aright,&#8212;verily<br> God loves those<br> Who act aright.</p>  
<p>77. As for those who sell<br> The faith they owe to God<br> And their own plighted word<br> For a small price,<br> They shall have no portion<br> In the Hereafter:</p>  
<p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></A></p>  
<p>Nor will God<br> (Deign to) speak to them<br> Or look at them<br> On the Day of Judgment,<br> Nor will He cleanse them<br> (Of sin): they shall have<br> A grievous Penalty.</p>  
<p>78. There is among them<br> A section who distort<br> The Book with their tongues<br> (As they read) you would think<br> It is a part of the Book,<br> But it is no part<br> Of the Book; and they say,<br> That is from God,"<br> But it is not from God:<br> It is they who tell<br> A lie against God,<br> And (well) they know it!</p>  
<p>79. It is not (possible)<br> That a man, to whom<br> Is given the Book,<br> And Wisdom,<br> And the Prophetic Office,<br> Should say to people:<br> "Be ye my worshippers<br> Rather than God's":<br> On the contrary<br> (He would say):<br> "Be ye worshippers<br> Of Him Who is truly<br> The Cherisher of all:<br> For ye have taught<br> The Book and ye<br> Have studied it earnestly."</p>  
<p>80. Nor would he instruct you<br> To take angels and prophets<br> For Lords and Patrons.<br> What! would he bid you</p>  
<p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></A></p>  
<p>To unbelief after ye have<br> Bowed your will<br> (To God in Islam)?</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 9.</h5>  
<p>81. Behold! God took<br> The Covenant of the Prophets,<br> Saying: "I give you<br> A Book and Wisdom;<br> Then comes to you<br> An Apostle, confirming<br> What is with you;<br> Do ye believe in him<br> And render him help."<br> God said: "Do ye agree,<br> And take this my Covenant<br> As binding on you?"<br> They said: "We agree."<br> He said: "Then bear witness,<br> And I am with you<br> Among the witnesses."</p>  
<p>82. If any turn back<br> After this, they are<br> Perverted transgressors.</p>  
<p>83. Do they seek<br> For other than the Religion<br> Of God?&#8212;while all creatures<br> In the heavens and on earth<br> Have, willing or unwilling,<br> Bowed to His Will<br> (Accepted Islam),<br> And to Him shall they<br> All be brought back.</p>  
<p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 145</font></A></p>  
<p>84. Say: "We believe<br> In God, and in what<br> Has been revealed to us<br> And what was revealed<br> To Abraham, Ism&#257;&#8217;&#299;l;<br> Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes,<br> And in (the Books)<br> Given to Moses, Jesus,<br> And the Prophets,<br> From their Lord:<br> We make no distinction<br> Between one and another<br> Among them, and to God do we<br> Bow our will (in Islam)."</p>  
<p>85. If anyone desires<br> A religion other than<br> Islam (submission to God),<br> Never will it be accepted<br> Of him; and in the Hereafter<br> He will be in the ranks<br> Of those who have lost<br> (All spiritual good).</p>  
<p>86. How shall God<br> Guide those who reject<br> Faith after they accepted it<br> And bore witness<br> That the Apostle was true<br> And that Clear Signs<br> Had come unto them?<br> But God guides not<br> A people unjust.</p>  
<p>87. Of such the reward<br> Is that on them (rests)</p>  
<p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></A></p>  
<p>The curse of God,<br> Of His angels,<br> And of all mankind;&#8212;</p>  
<p>88. In that will they dwell;<br> Nor will their penalty<br> Be lightened, nor respite<br> Be their (lot);&#8212;</p>  
<p>89. Except for those that repent<br> (Even) after that,<br> And make amends;<br> For verily God<br> Is Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
<p>90. But those who reject<br> Faith after they accepted it,<br> And then go on adding<br> To their defiance of Faith,&#8212;<br> Never will their repentance<br> Be accepted; for they<br> Are those who have<br> (Of set purpose) gone astray.</p>  
<p>91. As to those who reject<br> Faith, and die rejecting,&#8212;<br> Never would be accepted<br> From any such as much<br> Gold as the earth contains,<br> Though they should offer it<br> For ransom. For such<br> Is (in store) a penalty grievous,<br> And they will find no helpers.</p>  
<p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 10.</h5>  
<p>92. By no means shall ye<br> Attain righteousness unless<br> Ye give (freely) of that<br> Which ye love; and whatever<br> Ye give, of a truth<br> God knoweth it well.</p>  
<p>93. All food was lawful<br> To the Children of Israel,<br> Except what Israel<br> Made unlawful for itself,<br> Before the Law (of Moses)<br> Was revealed. Say:<br> "Bring ye the Law<br> And study it,<br> If ye be men of truth."</p>  
<p>94. If any, after this, invent<br> A lie and attribute it<br> To God, they are indeed<br> Unjust wrong-doers.</p>  
<p>95. Say: "God speaketh<br> The Truth: follow<br> The religion of Abraham,<br> The sane in faith; he<br> Was not of the Pagans."</p>  
<p>96. The first House (of worship)<br> Appointed for men<br> Was that at Bakka:<br> Full of blessing</p>  
<p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></A></p>  
<p>And of guidance<br> For all kinds of beings:</p>  
<p>97. In it are Signs<br> Manifest; (for example),<br> The Station of Abraham;<br> Whoever enters it<br> Attains security;<br> Pilgrimage thereto is a duty<br> Men owe to God,<br> Those who can afford<br> The journey; but if any<br> Deny faith, God stands not<br> In need of any of His creatures.</p>  
<p>98. Say: "O People of the Book!<br> Why reject ye the Signs<br> Of God, when God<br> Is Himself witness<br> To all ye do?"</p>  
<p>99. Say: "O ye People of the Book!<br> Why obstruct ye<br> Those who believe,<br> From the Path of God,<br> Seeking to make it crooked,<br> While ye were yourselves<br> Witnesses (to God's Covenant)?'<br> But God is not unmindful<br> Of all that ye do."</p>  
<p>100. O ye who believe!<br> If ye listen<br> To a faction<br> Among the People of the Book,<br> They would (indeed)<br> Render you apostates<br> After ye have believed!</p>  
<p>101. And how would ye<br> Deny Faith while unto you<br> Are rehearsed the Signs<br> Of God, and among you</p>  
<p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></A></p>  
<p>Lives the Apostle?<br> Whoever holds<br> Firmly to God<br> Will be shown<br> A Way that is straight.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 11.</h5>  
<p>102. O ye who believe!<br> Fear God as He should be<br> Feared, and die not<br> Except in a state<br> Of Islam.</p>  
<p>103. And hold fast,<br> All together, by the Rope<br> Which God (stretches out<br> For you), and be not divided<br> Among yourselves;<br> And remember with gratitude<br> God's favour on you;<br> For ye were enemies<br> And He joined your hearts<br> In love, so that by His Grace,<br> Ye became brethren;<br> And ye were on the brink<br> Of the Pit of Fire,<br> And He saved you from it.<br> Thus doth God make<br> His Signs clear to you:<br> That ye may be guided.</p>  
<p>104. Let there arise out of you<br> A band of people<br> Inviting to all that is good,<br> Enjoining what is right,</p>  
<p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></A></p>  
<p>And forbidding what is wrong:<br> They are the ones<br> To attain felicity.</p>  
<p>105. Be not like those<br> Who are divided<br> Amongst themselves<br> And fall into disputations<br> After receiving<br> Clear Signs:<br> For them<br> Is a dreadful Penalty,&#8212;</p>  
<p>106. On the Day when<br> Some faces will be (lit up<br> With) white, and some faces<br> Will be (in the gloom of) black:<br> To those whose faces<br> Will be black, (will be said):<br> "Did ye reject Faith<br> After accepting it?<br> Taste then the Penalty<br> For rejecting Faith."</p>  
<p>107. But those whose faces<br> Will be (lit with) white,&#8212;<br> They will be in (the light<br> Of) God's mercy: therein<br> To dwell (for ever).</p>  
<p>108. These are the Signs<br> Of God: We rehearse them<br> To thee in Truth:<br> And God means<br> No injustice to any<br> Of His creatures.</p>  
<p>109. To God belongs all<br> That is in the heavens</p>  
<p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></A></p>  
<p>And on earth: to Him<br> Do all questions<br> Go back (for decision).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 12.</h5>  
<p>110. Ye are the best<br> Of Peoples, evolved<br> For mankind,<br> Enjoining what is right,<br> Forbidding what is wrong,<br> And believing in God.<br> If only the People of the Book<br> Had faith, it were best<br> For them: among them<br> Are some who have faith,<br> But most of them<br> Are perverted transgressors.</p>  
<p>111: They will do you no harm,<br> Barring a trifling annoyance;<br> If they come out to fight you,<br> They will show you their backs,<br> And no help shall they get.</p>  
<p>112. Shame is pitched over them<br> (Like a tent) wherever<br> They are found,<br> Except when under a covenant<br> (Of protection) from God<br> And from men; they draw<br> On themselves wrath from God,<br> And pitched over them<br> Is (the tent of) destitution.<br> This because they rejected<br> The Signs of God, and slew<br> The Prophets in defiance of right;</p>  
<p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></A></p>  
<p>This because they rebelled<br> And transgressed beyond bounds.</p>  
<p>113. Not all of them are alike:<br> Of the People of the Book<br> Are a portion that stand<br> (For the right); they rehearse<br> The Signs of God all night long,<br> And they prostrate themselves<br> In adoration.</p>  
<p>114. They believe in God<br> And the Last Day;<br> They enjoin what is right,<br> And forbid what is wrong;<br> And they hasten (in emulation)<br> In (all) good works:<br> They are in the ranks<br> Of the righteous.</p>  
<p>115. Of the good that they do,<br> Nothing will be rejected<br> Of them; for God knoweth well<br> Those that do right.</p>  
<p>116. Those who reject Faith,&#8212;<br> Neither their possessions<br> Nor their (numerous) progeny<br> Will avail them aught against God:<br> They will be Companions<br> Of the Fire,&#8212;dwelling<br> Therein (for ever).</p>  
<p>117. What they spend<br> In the life<br> Of this (material) world<br> May be likened to a Wind<br> Which brings a nipping frost:<br> It strikes and destroys the harvest<br> Of men who have wronged</p>  
<p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="green">p. 153</font></A></p>  
<p>Their own souls: it is not God<br> That hath wronged them, but<br> They wrong themselves.</p>  
<p>118. O ye who believe!<br> Take not into your intimacy<br> Those outside your ranks:<br> They will not fail<br> To corrupt you. They<br> Only desire your ruin:<br> Rank hatred has already<br> Appeared from their mouths:<br> What their hearts conceal<br> Is far worse.<br> We have made plain<br> To you the Signs,<br> If ye have wisdom.</p>  
<p>119. Ah! ye are those<br> Who love them,<br> But they love you not,<br> Though ye believe<br> In the whole of the Book,<br> When they meet you,<br> They say, "We believe":<br> But when they are alone,<br> They bite off the very tips<br> Of their fingers at you<br> In their rage. Say:<br> "Perish in your rage;<br> God knoweth well<br> All the secrets of the heart."</p>  
<p>120. If aught that is good<br> Befalls you, it grieves them;<br> But if some misfortune<br> Overtakes you, they rejoice</p>  
<p><a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="green">p. 154</font></A></p>  
<p>At it. But if ye are constant<br> And do right,<br> Not the least harm<br> Will their cunning<br> Do to you; for God<br> Compasseth round about<br> All that they do.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 13.</h5>  
<p>121. Remember that morning<br> Thou didst leave<br> Thy household (early)<br> To post the Faithful<br> At their stations for battle:<br> And God heareth<br> And knoweth all things:</p>  
<p><a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="green">p. 155</font></A></p>  
<p>122. Rememer two of your parties<br> Meditated cowardice;<br> But God was their protector,<br> And in God should the Faithful<br> (Ever) put their trust.</p>  
<p>123. God had helped you<br> At Badr, when ye were<br> A contemptible little force;<br> Then fear God; thus<br> May ye show your gratitude.</p>  
<p>124. Remember thou saidst<br> To the Faithful: "Is it not enough<br> For you that God should help you<br> With three thousand angels<br> (Specially) sent down?</p>  
<p>125. "Yea,&#8212;if ye remain firm,<br> And act aright, even if<br> The enemy should rush here<br> On you in hot haste,<br> Your Lord would help you<br> With five thousand angels<br> Making a terrific onslaught."</p>  
<p>126. God made it but a message<br> Of hope for you, and an assurance<br> To your hearts: (in any case)<br> There is no help<br> Except from God,<br> The Exalted, the Wise:</p>  
<p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="green">p. 156</font></A></p>  
<p>127. That He might cut off<br> A fringe of the Unbelievers<br> Or expose them to infamy,<br> And they should then<br> Be turned back,<br> Frustrated of their purpose.</p>  
<p>128. Not for thee, (but for God),<br> Is the decision:<br> Whether He turn in mercy<br> To them, or punish them;<br> For they are indeed wrong-doers.</p>  
<p>129. To God belongeth all<br> That is in the heavens<br> And on earth.<br> He forgiveth whom He pleaseth<br> And punisheth whom He pleaseth<br> But God is Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 14.</h5>  
<p>130. ye who believe!<br> Devour not Usury,<br> Doubled and multiplied;<br> But fear God; that<br> Ye may (really) prosper.</p>  
<p>131. Fear the Fire, which is prepared<br> For those who reject Faith:</p>  
<p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="green">p. 157</font></A></p>  
<p>132. And obey God<br> And the Apostle;<br> That ye may obtain mercy.</p>  
<p>133. Be quick in the race<br> For forgiveness from your Lord,<br> And for a Garden whose width<br> Is that (of the whole)<br> Of the heavens<br> And of the earth,<br> Prepared for the righteous,&#8212;</p>  
<p>134. Those who spend (freely),<br> Whether in prosperity,<br> Or in adversity;<br> Who restrain anger,<br> And pardon (all) men;&#8212;<br> For God loves those<br> Who do good;&#8212;</p>  
<p>135. And those who,<br> Having done something<br> To be ashamed of,<br> Or wronged their own souls,<br> Earnestly bring God to mind,<br> And ask for forgiveness<br> For their sins,<br> And who can forgive<br> Sins except God?&#8212;<br> And are never obstinate<br> In persisting knowingly<br> In (the wrong) they have done</p>  
<p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="green">p. 158</font></A></p>  
<p>136. For such the reward<br> Is forgiveness from their Lord,<br> And Gardens with rivers<br> Flowing underneath,&#8212;<br> An eternal dwelling:<br> How excellent a recompense<br> For those who work (and strive)!</p>  
<p>137. Many were the Ways of Life<br> That have passed away<br> Before you: travel through<br> The earth, and see what was<br> The end of those<br> Who rejected Truth.</p>  
<p>138. Here is a plain statement<br> To men, a guidance<br> And instruction to those<br> Who fear God!</p>  
<p>139. So lose not heart,<br> Nor fall into despair:<br> For ye must gain mastery<br> If ye are true in Faith.</p>  
<p>140. If a wound hath touched you,<br> Be sure a similar wound<br> Hath touched the others.<br> Such days (of varying fortunes)<br> We give to men and men<br> By turns: that God may know<br> Those that believe,<br> And that He may take<br> To Himself from your ranks<br> Martyr-witnesses (to Truth).<br> And God loveth not<br> Those that do wrong.</p>  
<p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="green">p. 159</font></A></p>  
<p>141. God's object also is to purge<br> Those that are true in Faith<br> And to deprive of blessing<br> Those that resist Faith.</p>  
<p>142. Did ye think that ye<br> Would enter Heaven<br> Without God testing<br> Those of you who fought hard<br> (In His Cause) and<br> Remained steadfast?</p>  
<p>143. Ye did indeed<br> Wish for Death<br> Before ye met him:<br> Now ye have seen him<br> With your own eyes,<br> (And ye flinch!)</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 15.</h5>  
<p>144. Muhammad is no more<br> Than an Apostle: many<br> Were the Apostles that passed away<br> Before him. If he died<br> Or were slain, will ye then<br> Turn back on your heels?<br> If any did turn back<br> On his heels, not the least<br> Harm will he do to God;<br> But God (on the other hand)<br> Will swiftly reward those<br> Who (serve him) with gratitude.</p>  
<p>145. Nor can a soul die<br> Except by God's leave,</p>  
<p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="green">p. 160</font></A></p>  
<p>The term being fixed<br> As by writing. If any<br> Do desire a reward<br> In this life, We shall give it<br> To him; and if any<br> Do desire a reward<br> In the Hereafter, We shall<br> Give it to him.<br> And swiftly shall We reward<br> Those that (serve us with) gratitude.</p>  
<p>146. How many of the Prophets<br> Fought (in God's way),<br> And with them (fought)<br> Large bands of godly men?<br> But they never lost heart<br> If they met with disaster<br> In God's way, nor did<br> They weaken (in will)<br> Nor give in. And God<br> Loves those who are<br> Firm and steadfast.</p>  
<p>147. All that they said was:<br> "Our Lord! forgive us<br> Our sins and anything<br> We may have done<br> That transgressed our duty:<br> Establish our feet firmly,<br> And help us against<br> Those that resist<br> Faith."</p>  
<p>148. And God gave them<br> A reward in this world,<br> And the excellent reward<br> Of the Hereafter. For God<br> Loveth those who do good.</p>  
<p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 16.</h5>  
<p>149. O ye who believe!<br> If ye obey the Unbelievers,<br> They will drive you back<br> On your heels, and ye<br> Will turn back (from Faith)<br> To your own loss.</p>  
<p>150. Nay, God is your Protector,<br> And He is the best of helpers.</p>  
<p>151. Soon shall We cast terror<br> Into the hearts of the Unbelievers<br> For that they joined companions<br> With God, for which He had sew<br> No authority: their abode<br> Will be the Fire: and evil<br> Is the home of the wrong-doers!</p>  
<p>152. God did indeed fulfil<br> His promise to you<br> When ye with His permission<br> Were about to annihilate<br> Your enemy,&#8212;until ye flinched<br> And fell to disputing<br> About the order,<br> And disobeyed it<br> After He brought you in sight<br> (Of the Booty) which ye covet.<br> Among you are some<br> That hanker after this world<br> And some that desire<br> The Hereafter. Then did He</p>  
<p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></A></p>  
<p>Divert you from your foes<br> In order to test you.<br> But He forgave you:<br> For God is full of grace<br> To those who believe.</p>  
<p>153. Behold! ye were climbing up<br> The high ground, without even<br> Casting a side glance<br> At any one, and the Apostle<br> In your rear was calling you<br> Back. There did God give you<br> One distress after another<br> By way of requital,<br> To teach you not to grieve<br> For (the booty) that had escaped you<br> And for (the ill) that had befallen you.<br> For God is well aware<br> Of all that ye do.</p>  
<p>154. After (the excitement)<br> Of the distress, He sent down<br> Calm on a band of you<br> Overcome with slumber,<br> While another band<br> Was stirred to anxiety<br> By their own feelings,<br> Moved by wrong suspicions<br> Of God&#8212;suspicions due<br> To Ignorance. They said:<br> "What affair is this of ours?"<br> Say thou: "Indeed, this affair</p>  
<p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></A></p>  
<p>Is wholly God's." They hide<br> In their minds what they<br> Dare not reveal to thee.<br> They say (to themselves):<br> "If we had had anything<br> To do with this affair,<br> We should not have been<br> In the slaughter here."<br> Say: "Even if you had remained<br> In your homes, those<br> For whom death was decreed<br> Would certainly have gone forth<br> To the place of their death";<br> But (all this was)<br> That God might test<br> What is in your breasts<br> And purge what is<br> In your hearts.<br> For God knoweth well<br> The secrets of your hearts.</p>  
<p>155. Those of you<br> Who turned back<br> On the day the two hosts<br> Met,&#8212;it was Satan<br> Who caused them to fail,<br> Because of some (evil)<br> They had done. But God<br> Has blotted out (their fault):<br> For God is Oft-forgiving,<br> Most Forbearing.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 17.</h5>  
<p>156. O ye who believe!<br> Be not like the Unbelievers,<br> Who say of their brethren,<br> When they are travelling<br> Through the earth or engaged<br> In fighting: "If they had stayed<br> With us, they would not<br> Have died, or been slain."</p>  
<p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></A></p>  
<p>This that God may make it<br> A cause of sighs and regrets<br> In their hearts. It is God<br> That gives Life and Death,<br> And God sees well<br> All that ye do.</p>  
<p>157. And if ye are slain, or die,<br> In the way of God,<br> Forgiveness and mercy<br> From God are far better<br> Than all they could amass.</p>  
<p>158. And if ye die, or are slain,<br> Lo! it is-unto God<br> That ye are brought together.</p>  
<p>159. It is part of the Mercy<br> Of God that thou dost deal<br> Gently with them.<br> Wert thou severe<br> Or harsh-hearted,<br> They would have broken away<br> From about thee: so pass over<br> (Their faults), and ask<br> For (God's) forgiveness<br> For them; and consult<br> Them in affairs (of moment).<br> Then, when thou hast<br> Taken a decision,<br> Put thy trust in God.</p>  
<p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></A></p>  
<p>For God loves those<br> Who put their trust (in Him).</p>  
<p>160. If God helps you,<br> Non can overcome you:<br> If He forsakes you,<br> Who is there, after that,<br> That can help you?<br> In God, then,<br> Let Believers put their trust.</p>  
<p>161. No prophet could (ever)<br> Be false to his trust.<br> If any person is so false,<br> He shall, on the Day<br> Of Judgment, restore<br> What he misappropriated;<br> Then shall every soul<br> Receive its due,&#8212;<br> Whatever it earned,&#8212;<br> And none shall be<br> Dealt with unjustly.</p>  
<p>162. Is the man who follows<br> The good pleasure of God<br> Like the man who draws<br> On himself the wrath<br> Of God, and whose abode<br> Is in Hell?&#8212;<br> A woeful refuge!</p>  
<p>163. They are in varying grades<br> In the sight of God,<br> And God sees well<br> All that they do.</p>  
<p>164. God did confer<br> A great favour</p>  
<p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></A></p>  
<p>On the Believers<br> When He sent among them<br> An Apostle from among<br> Themselves, rehearsing<br> Unto them the Signs<br> Of God, sanctifying them,<br> And instructing them<br> In Scripture and Wisdom,<br> While, before that,<br> They had been<br> In manifest error.</p>  
<p>165. What! When a single<br> Disaster smites you,<br> Although ye smote (your enemies)<br> With one twice as great,<br> Do ye say?&#8212;<br> "Whence is this?"<br> Say (to them):<br> "It is from yourselves:<br> For God hath power<br> Over all things."</p>  
<p>166. What ye suffered<br> On the day the two armies<br> Met, was with the leave<br> Of God, in order that<br> He might test the Believers,&#8212;</p>  
<p>167. And the Hypocrites also.<br> These were told: "Come,<br> Fight in the way of God,<br> Or (at least) drive<br> (The foe from Your city)."<br> They said: "Had we known<br> How to fight, we should<br> Certainly have followed you."</p>  
<p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="green">p. 167</font></A></p>  
<p>They were that day<br> Nearer to Unbelief<br> Than to Faith,<br> Saying with their lips<br> What was not in their hearts.<br> But God hath full knowledge<br> Of all they conceal.</p>  
<p>168. (They are) the ones that say,<br> (Of their brethren slain),<br> While they themselves<br> Sit (at ease): "If only<br> They had listened to us,<br> They would not have been slain."<br> Say: "Avert death<br> From your own selves,<br> If ye speak the truth."</p>  
<p>169. Think not of those<br> Who are slain in God's way<br> As dead. Nay, they live,<br> Finding their sustenance<br> In the Presence of their Lord;</p>  
<p>170. They rejoice in the Bounty<br> Provided by God:<br> And with regard to those<br> Left behind, who have not<br> Yet joined them (in their bliss),<br> The (Martyrs) glory in the fact<br> That on them is no fear,<br> Nor have they (cause to) grieve.</p>  
<p>171. They glory in the Grace<br> And the Bounty from God,<br> And in the fact that<br> God suffereth not</p>  
<p><a name="page_168"><font size="1" color="green">p. 168</font></A></p>  
<p>The reward of the Faithful<br> To be lost (in the least).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 18.</h5>  
<p>172. Of those who answered<br> The call of God<br> And the Apostle,<br> Even after being wounded,<br> Those who do right<br> And refrain from wrong<br> Have a great reward;&#8212;</p>  
<p>173. Men said to them:<br> "A great army is gathering<br> Against you":<br> And frightened them:<br> But it (only) increased<br> Their Faith: they said:<br> "For us God sufficeth,<br> And He is the best<br> Disposer of affairs."</p>  
<p>174. And they returned<br> With Grace and Bounty<br> From God: no harm<br> Ever touched them:<br> For they followed<br> The good pleasure of God:<br> And God is the Lord<br> Of bounties unbounded.</p>  
<p>175. It is only the Evil One<br> That suggests to you<br> The fear of his votaries:<br> Be ye not afraid<br> Of them, but fear Me,<br> If ye have Faith.</p>  
<p>176. Let not those grieve thee<br> Who rush headlong<br> Into Unbelief:<br> Not the least harm<br> Will they do to God:<br> God's Plan is that He</p>  
<p><a name="page_169"><font size="1" color="green">p. 169</font></A></p>  
<p>Will give them no portion<br> In the Hereafter,<br> But a severe punishment.</p>  
<p>177. Those who purchase<br> Unbelief at the price<br> Of faith,<br> Not the least harm<br> Will they do to God,<br> But they will have<br> A grievous punishment.</p>  
<p>178. Let not the Unbelievers<br> Think that Our respite<br> To them is good for themselves:<br> We grant them respite<br> That they may grow<br> In their iniquity:<br> But they will have<br> A shameful punishment.</p>  
<p>179. God will not leave<br> The Believers in the state<br> In which ye are now,<br> Until He separates<br> What is evil<br> From what is good.<br> Nor will He disclose<br> To you the secrets<br> Of the Unseen,<br> But He chooses<br> Of His Apostles<br> (For the purpose)<br> Whom He pleases.<br> So believe in God<br> And His Apostles:<br> And if ye believe<br> And do right,<br> Ye have a reward<br> Without measure.</p>  
<p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></A></p>  
<p>180. And let not those<br> Who covetously withhold<br> Of the gifts which God<br> Hath given them of His Grace,<br> Think that it is good for them:<br> Nay, it will be the worse<br> For them: soon shall the things<br> Which they covetously withheld<br> Be tied to their necks<br> Like a twisted collar,<br> On the Day of Judgment.<br> To God belongs the heritage<br> Of the heavens and the earth;<br> And God is well-acquainted<br> With all that ye do.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 19.</h5>  
<p>181. God hath heard<br> The taunt of those<br> Who say: "Truly, God<br> Is indigent and we<br> Are rich!"&#8212;We shall<br> Certainly record their word</p>  
<p><a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="green">p. 171</font></A></p>  
<p>And (their act) of slaying<br> The Prophets in defiance<br> Of right, and We shall say:<br> "Taste ye the Penalty<br> Of the Scorching Fire!</p>  
<p>182. "This is because<br> Of the (unrighteous deeds)<br> Which your hands<br> Sent on before ye:<br> For God never harms<br> Those who serve Him."</p>  
<p>183. They (also) said: "God took<br> Our promise not to believe<br> In an apostle unless<br> He showed us a sacrifice<br> Consumed by fire<br> (From heaven)." Say:<br> "There came to you<br> Apostles before me,<br> With Clear Signs<br> And even with what<br> Ye ask for: why then<br> Did ye slay them,<br> If ye speak the truth?"</p>  
<p>184. Then if they reject thee,<br> So were rejected apostles<br> Before thee, who came<br> With Clear Signs,<br> Books of dark prophecies,<br> And the Book of Enlightenment.</p>  
<p><a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="green">p. 172</font></A></p>  
<p>185. Every soul shall have<br> A taste of death:<br> And only on the Day<br> Of Judgment shall you<br> Be paid your full recompense.<br> Only he who is saved<br> Far from the Fire<br> And admitted to the Garden<br> Will have attained<br> The object (of Life):<br> For the life of this world<br> Is but goods and chattels<br> Of deception.</p>  
<p>186. Ye shall certainly<br> Be tried and tested<br> In your possessions<br> And in your personal selves;<br> And ye shall certainly<br> Hear much that will grieve you,<br> From those who received<br> The Book before yot:<br> And from those who<br> Worship many gods.<br> But if ye persevere<br> Patiently, and guard<br> Against evil,&#8212;then<br> That will be<br> A determining factor<br> In all affairs.</p>  
<p>187. And remember<br> God took a Covenant<br> From the People of the Book,<br> To make it known<br> And clear to mankind,<br> And not to hide it;</p>  
<p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173</font></A></p>  
<p>But they threw it away<br> Behind their backs,<br> And purchased with it<br> Some miserable gain!<br> And vile was the bargain<br> They made!</p>  
<p>188. Think not that those<br> Who exult in what they<br> Have brought about, and love<br> To be praised for what<br> They have not done,&#8212;<br> Think not that they<br> Can escape the Penalty.<br> For them is a Penalty<br> Grievous indeed.</p>  
<p>189. To God belongeth<br> The dominion<br> Of the heavens<br> And the earth;<br> And God hath power<br> Over all things.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 20.</h5>  
<p>190. Behold! In the creation<br> Of the heavens and the earth,<br> And the alternation<br> Of Night and Day,&#8212;<br> There are indeed Signs<br> For men of understanding,&#8212;</p>  
<p>191. Men who celebrate<br> The praises of God,<br> Standing, sitting,<br> And lying down on their sides,<br> And contemplate<br> The (wonders of) creation</p>  
<p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></A></p>  
<p>In the heavens and the earth,<br> (With the thought):<br> "Our Lord! not for naught<br> Hast Thou created (all) this!<br> Glory to Thee! Give us<br> Salvation from the Penalty<br> Of the Fire.</p>  
<p>192. "Our Lord! any whom Thou<br> Dost admit to the Fire,<br> Truly Thou coverest with shame,<br> And never will wrong-doers<br> Find any helpers!</p>  
<p>193. "Our Lord! we have heard<br> The call of one calling<br> (Us) to Faith, 'Believe ye<br> In the Lord,' and we<br> Have believed. Our Lord!<br> Forgive us our sins,<br> Blot out from us<br> Our iniquities, and take<br> To Thyself our souls<br> In the company of the righteous.</p>  
<p>194. "Our Lord! Grant us<br> What Thou didst promise<br> Unto us through Thine Apostles,<br> And save us from shame<br> On the Day of Judgment:<br> For Thou never breakest<br> Thy promise."</p>  
<p>195. And their Lord hath accepted<br> Of them, and answered them:<br> "Never will I suffer to be lost<br> The work of any of you,</p>  
<p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></A></p>  
<p>Be he male or female:<br> Ye are members, one of another:<br> Those who have left their homes,<br> Or been driven out therefrom,<br> Or suffered harm in My Cause,<br> Or fought or been slain,&#8212;<br> Verily, I will blot out<br> From them their iniquities,<br> And admit them into Gardens<br> With rivers flowing beneath;&#8212;<br> A reward from the Presence<br> Of God, and from His Presence<br> Is the best of rewards."</p>  
<p>196. Let not the strutting about<br> Of the Unbelievers<br> Through the land<br> Deceive thee:</p>  
<p>197. Little is it for enjoyment:<br> Their ultimate abode<br> Is Hell: what an evil bed<br> (To lie on)!</p>  
<p>198. On the other hand, for those<br> Who fear their Lord,<br> Are Gardens, with rivers<br> Flowing beneath; therein<br> Are they to dwell (for ever),&#8212;<br> A gift from the Presence<br> Of God; and that which is<br> In the Presence of God<br> Is the best (bliss)<br> For the righteous.</p>  
<p>199. And there are, certainly,<br> Among the People of the Book,</p>  
<p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></A></p>  
<p>Those who believe in God,<br> In the revelation to you,<br> And in the revelation to them,<br> Bowing in humility to God:<br> They will not sell<br> The Signs of God<br> For a miserable gain!<br> For them is a reward<br> With their Lord,<br> And God is swift in account.</p>  
<p>200. O ye who believe!<br> Persevere in patience<br> And constancy; vie<br> In such perseverance;<br> Strengthen each other;<br> And fear God;<br> That ye may prosper.</p>
