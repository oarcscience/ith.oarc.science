### Sūra XXXVI.

### *Yā-Sīn* (being Abbreviated Letters).

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Yā Sīn.

2\. By the Qur-ān  
Full of Wisdom,—

3\. Thou art indeed  
One of the apostles,

4\. On a Straight Way.

5\. It is a Revelation  
Sent down by (Him),  
The Exalted in Might,  
Most Merciful,

6\. In order that thou mayest  
Admonish a people,  
Whose fathers had received  
No admonition, and who  
Therefore remain heedless  
(Of the Signs of God).

<span id="page_1170">p. 1170</span>

7\. The Word is proved true  
Against the greater part of them:  
For they do not believe.

8\. We have put yokes  
Round their necks  
Right up to their chins,  
So that their heads are  
Forced up (and they cannot see).

9\. And We have put  
A bar in front of them  
And a bar behind them,  
And further, We have  
Covered them up; so that  
They cannot see.

10\. The same is it to them  
Whether thou admonish them  
Or thou do not admonish  
Them: they will not believe.

<span id="page_1171">p. 1171</span>

11\. Thou canst but admonish  
Such a one as follows  
The Message and fears  
The (Lord) Most Gracious, unseen:  
Give such a one, therefore,  
Good tidings, of Forgiveness  
And a reward most generous.

12\. Verily We shall give life  
To the dead, and We record  
That which they send before  
And that which they leave  
Behind, and of all things  
Have We taken account

<span id="page_1172">p. 1172</span>

In a clear Book  
(Of evidence).

##### SECTION 2.

13\. Set forth to them,  
By way of a parable,  
The (story of) the Companions  
Of the City. Behold,  
There came apostles to it.

14\. When We (first) sent  
To them two apostles,  
They rejected them:  
But We strengthened them  
With a third: they said,  
"Truly, we have been sent  
On a mission to you."

<span id="page_1173">p. 1173</span>

15\. The (people) said: "Ye are  
Only men like ourselves  
And (God) Most Gracious  
Sends no sort of revelation:  
Ye do nothing but lie."

16\. They said: "Our Lord doth  
Know that we have been sent  
On a mission to you:

17\. "And our duty is only  
To proclaim the clear Message.

18\. The (people) said: "For us,  
We augur an evil omen

<span id="page_1174">p. 1174</span>

From you: if ye desist not,  
We will certainly stone you.  
And a grievous punishment  
Indeed will be inflicted  
On you by us."

19\. They said: "Your evil omens  
Are with yourselves:  
(Deem ye this an evil omen).  
If ye are admonished?  
Nay, but ye are a people  
Transgressing all bounds!

20\. Then there came running,  
From the farthest part  
Of the City, a man,  
Saying, "O my People!  
Obey the apostles:

21\. "Obey those who ask  
No reward of you  
(For themselves), and who have  
Themselves received Guidance

<span id="page_1175">p. 1175</span>

22, "It would not be reasonable  
In me if I did not  
Serve Him Who created me,  
And to Whom ye shall  
(All) be brought back.

23\. "Shall I take (other) gods  
Besides Him? If (God)  
Most Gracious should  
Intend some adversity for me,  
Of no use whatever  
Will be their intercession  
For me, nor can they  
Deliver me.

24."I would indeed,  
If I were to do so,  
Be in manifest Error.

25\. "For me, I have faith  
In the Lord of you (all):  
Listen, then, to me!"

26\. It was said: "Enter thou  
The Garden." He said:  
"Ah me! Would that  
My People knew (what I know)!—

<span id="page_1176">p. 1176</span>

27\. "For that my Lord  
Has granted me Forgiveness  
And has enrolled me  
Among those held in honour!"

28\. And We sent not down  
Against his People, after him,  
Any hosts from heaven,  
Nor was it needful  
For Us so to do.

29\. It was no more than  
A single mighty Blast,  
And behold! they were (like ashes)  
Quenched and silent.

30\. Ah! alas for (My) servants!  
There comes not an apostle  
To them but they mock him!

31\. See they not how many  
Generations before them  
We destroyed? Not to them  
Will they return:

<span id="page_1177">p. 1177</span>

32\. But each one of them  
All—will be brought  
Before Us (for judgment).

##### SECTION 3.

33\. A Sign for them  
Is the earth that is dead:  
We do give it life,  
And produce grain therefrom,  
Of which ye do eat.

34\. And We produce therein  
Orchards with date-palms  
And vines, and We cause  
Springs to gush forth therein:

35\. That they may enjoy  
The fruits of this (artistry):  
It was not their hands  
That made this:  
Will they not then give thanks?

<span id="page_1178">p. 1178</span>

36\. Glory to God, Who created  
In pairs all things that  
The earth produces, as well as  
Their own (human) kind  
And (other) things of which  
They have no knowledge.

37\. And a Sign for them  
Is the Night: We withdraw  
Therefrom the Day, and behold  
They are plunged in darkness;

38\. And the Sun  
Runs his course  
For a period determined  
For him: that is  
The decree of (Him),  
The Exalted in Might,  
The All-Knowing.

39\. And the Moon,  
We have measured for her  
Mansions (to traverse)  
Till she returns  
Like the old (and withered)  
Lower part of a date-stalk.

<span id="page_1179">p. 1179</span>

40\. It is not permitted  
To the Sun to catch up  
The Moon, nor can  
The Night outstrip the Day:  
Each (just) swims along (its own) orbit  
(According to Law).

41\. And a Sign for them  
Is that We bore  
Their race (through the Flood)  
In the loaded Ark;

42\. And We have created  
For them similar (vessels)  
On which they ride.

43\. If it were Our Will,  
We could drown them:  
Then would there be  
No helper (to hear  
Their cry), nor could  
They be delivered,

<span id="page_1180">p. 1180</span>

44\. Except by way of Mercy  
From Us, and by way  
Of (worldly) convenience  
(To serve them) for a time.

45\. When they are told,  
"Fear ye that which is  
Before you and that which  
Will be after you, in order  
That ye may receive Mercy,"  
(They turn back).

46\. Not a Sign comes to them  
From among the Signs  
Of their Lord, but they  
Turn away therefrom.

47\. And when they are told,  
"Spend ye of (the bounties)  
With which God  
Has provided you," the Unbelievers  
Say to those who believe:  
"Shall we then feed those  
Whom, if God had so willed,  
He would have fed, (Himself)?—

<span id="page_1181">p. 1181</span>

Ye are in nothing  
But manifest error."

48\. Further, they say, "When  
Will this promise (come to pass),  
If what ye say is true?"

49\. They will not (have  
To) wait for aught  
But a single Blast:  
It will seize them while  
They are yet disputing  
Among themselves!

50\. No (chance) will they then  
Have, by will, to dispose  
(Of their affairs), nor  
To return to their own people!

##### SECTION 4.

51\. The trumpet shall be  
Sounded, when behold!  
From the sepulchres (men)  
Will rush forth  
To their Lord!

<span id="page_1182">p. 1182</span>

52\. They will say: "Ah!  
Woe unto us! Who  
Hath raised us up  
From our beds of repose?"  
(A voice will say:)  
"This is what (God)  
Most Gracious had promised.  
And true was the word  
Of the apostles!"

53\. It will be no more  
Than a single Blast,  
When to! they will all  
Be brought up before Us!

54\. Then, on that Day,  
Not a soul will be  
Wronged in the least,  
And ye shall but  
Be repaid the meeds  
Of your past Deeds.

55\. Verily the Companions  
Of the Garden shall  
That Day have joy  
In all that they do:

<span id="page_1183">p. 1183</span>

56\. They and their associates  
Will be in groves  
Of (cool) shade, reclining  
On Thrones (of dignity);

57\. (Every) fruit (enjoyment)  
Will be there for them;  
They shall have whatever  
They call for;

58\. "Peace!"—a Word  
(Of salutation) from a Lord  
Most Merciful!

59\. "And O ye in sin!  
Get ye apart this Day!

60\. "Did I not enjoin  
On you, O ye children

<span id="page_1184">p. 1184</span>

Of Adam, that ye  
Should not worship Satan;  
For that he was to you  
An enemy avowed?—

61\. "And that ye should  
Worship Me, (for that) this  
Was the Straight Way?

62\. "But he did lead astray  
A great multitude of you.  
Did ye not, then, understand?

63\. "This is the Hell  
Of which ye were  
(Repeatedly) warned!

64\. "Embrace ye the (Fire)  
This Day, for that ye  
(Persistently) rejected (Truth)."

65\. That Day shall We set  
A seal on their mouths.  
But their hands will speak  
To Us, and their feet  
Bear witness, to all  
That they did.

<span id="page_1185">p. 1185</span>

66\. If it had been Our Will,  
We could surely have  
Blotted out their eyes;  
Then should they have  
Run about groping for the Path,  
But how could they have seen?

67\. And if it had been  
Our Will, We could  
Have transformed them  
(To remain) in their places;  
Then should they have been  
Unable to move about,  
Nor could they have returned  
(After error).

##### SECTION 5.

68\. If We grant long life  
To any, We cause him  
To be reversed in nature:  
Will they not then understand?

69\. We have not instructed  
The (Prophet) in Poetry,  
Nor is it meet for him:  
This is no less than

<span id="page_1186">p. 1186</span>

A Message and a Qur-ān  
Making things clear:

70\. That it may give admonition  
To any (who are) alive,  
And that the charge  
May be proved against those  
Who reject (Truth).

71\. See they not that it is  
We Who have created  
For them—among the things  
Which our hands have fashioned—  
Cattle, which are under  
Their dominion?—

72\. And that We have  
Subjected them to their (use)?  
Of them some do carry them  
And some they eat:

73\. And they have (other) profits  
From them (besides), and they  
Get (milk) to drink.  
Will they not then  
Be grateful?

74\. Yet they take (for worship)  
Gods other than God,

<span id="page_1187">p. 1187</span>

(Hoping) that they might  
Be helped!

75\. They have not the power  
To help them: but they  
Will be brought up  
(Before Our Judgment-seat)  
As a troop (to be condemned).

76\. Let not their speech, then,  
Grieve thee. Verily We know  
What they hide as well as  
What they disclose.

77\. Doth not man see  
That it is We Who  
Created him from sperm?  
Yet behold! he (stands forth)  
As an open adversary!

78\. And he makes comparisons  
For Us, and forgets his own  
(Origin and) Creation:  
He says, "Who can give  
Life to (dry) bones  
And decomposed ones (at that)?"

<span id="page_1188">p. 1188</span>

79\. Say, "He will give them  
Life Who created them  
For the first time!  
For He is well-versed  
In every kind of creation!

80\. "The same Who produces  
For you fire out of  
The green tree, when behold!  
Ye kindle therewith  
(Your own fires)!

81\. "Is not He Who created  
The heavens and the earth  
Able to create the like  
Thereof?"—Yea, indeed!  
For he is the Creator Supreme,  
Of skill and knowledge (infinite)!

82\. Verily, when He intends  
A thing, His Command is,  
"Be", and it is!

83\. So glory to Him  
In Whose hands is  
The dominion of all things:  
And to Him will  
Be all brought back.
