### Sūra LXIII.

### *Munāfiqūn*, or the Hypocrites.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*

1\. When the Hypocrites  
Come to thee, they say,  
"We bear witness that thou  
Art indeed the Apostle  
Of God." Yea, God  
Knoweth that thou art  
Indeed His Apostle,  
And God beareth witness  
That the Hypocrites are  
Indeed liars.

2\. They have made their oaths  
A screen (for their misdeeds):  
Thus they obstruct (men)  
From the Path of God:  
Truly evil are their deeds.

3\. That is because they believed,  
Then they rejected Faith:  
So a seal was set  
On their hearts: therefore  
They understand not.

4\. When thou lookest  
At them, their exteriors

<span id="page_1551">p. 1551</span>

Please thee; and when  
They speak, thou listenest  
To their words. They are  
As (worthless as hollow)  
Pieces of timber propped up,  
(Unable to stand on their own).  
They think that every  
Cry is against them.  
They are the enemies;  
So beware of them.  
The curse of God be  
On them! How are they  
Deluded (away from the Truth)!

5\. And when it is said  
To them, "Come, the Apostle  
Of God will pray for your  
Forgiveness" they turn aside  
Their heads, and thou wouldst  
See them turning away  
Their faces in arrogance.

6\. It is equal to them  
Whether thou pray for  
Their forgiveness or not.  
God will not forgive them.  
Truly God guides not  
Rebellious transgressors.

7\. They are the ones who say,  
"Spend nothing on those  
Who are with God's Apostle,  
To the end that they

<span id="page_1552">p. 1552</span>

May disperse (and quit Medina)."  
But to God belong  
The treasures of the heavens  
And the earth; but  
The Hypocrites understand not.

8\. They say, "If we  
Return to Medina, surely  
The more honourable (element)  
Will expel therefrom the meaner".  
But honour belongs to God  
And His Apostle, and  
To the Believers; but  
The Hypocrites know not.

##### SECTION 2.

9\. O ye who believe!  
Let not your riches  
Or your children divert you  
From the remembrance of God.  
If any act thus,  
The loss is their own.

10\. And spend something (in charity)  
Out of the substance  
Which We have bestowed  
On you, before Death  
Should come to any of you  
And he should say,  
"O my Lord! Why didst  
Thou not give me  
Respite for a little while?  
I should then have given

<span id="page_1553">p. 1553</span>

(Largely) in charity, and I  
Should have been one  
Of the doers of good".

11\. But to no soul  
Will God grant respite  
When the time appointed  
(For it) has come; and God  
Is well acquainted  
With (all) that ye do.
