### Sūra LXXVII.

### *Mursalāt,* or Those Sent Forth.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. By the (Winds) Sent Forth  
One after another  
(To man's profit);

2\. Which then blow violently  
In tempestuous Gusts,

3\. And scatter (things)  
Far and wide;

4\. Then separate them,  
One from another,

<span id="page_1664">p. 1664</span>

5\. Then spread abroad  
A Message,

6\. Whether of Justification  
Or of Warning;—

7\. Assuredly, what ye are  
Promised must come to pass.

8\. Then when the stars  
Become dim;

9\. When the heaven  
Is cleft asunder;

10\. When the mountains are  
Scattered (to the winds) as dust;

11\. And when the apostles  
Are (all) appointed a time  
(To collect);—

12\. For what Day are these  
(Portents) deferred?

<span id="page_1665">p. 1665</span>

13\. For the Day of Sorting out.

14\. And what will explain  
To thee what is  
The Day of Sorting out?

15\. Ah woe, that Day,  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

16\. Did We not destroy  
The men of old  
(For their evil)?

17\. So shall We make  
Later (generations)  
Follow them.

18\. Thus do We deal  
With men of sin.

19\. Ah woe, that Day,  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

20\. Have We not created  
You from a fluid  
(Held) despicable?—

21\. The which We placed  
In a place of rest,  
Firmly fixed,

<span id="page_1666">p. 1666</span>

22\. For a period (of gestation),  
Determined (according to need)?

23\. For We do determine  
(According to need); for We  
Are the Best to determine (things).

24\. Ah woe, that Day!  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

25\. Have We not made  
The earth (as a place)  
To draw together

26\. The living and the dead,

27\. And made therein  
Mountains standing firm,  
Lofty (in stature);  
And provided for you  
Water sweet (and wholesome)?

28\. Ah woe, that Day,  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

<span id="page_1667">p. 1667</span>

29\. (It will be said:)  
"Depart ye to that  
Which ye used to reject  
As false!

30\. "Depart ye to a Shadow  
(Of smoke ascending)  
In three columns,

31\. "(Which yields) no shade  
Of coolness, and is  
Of no use against  
The fierce Blaze.

32\. "Indeed it throws about  
Sparks (huge) as Forts,

33\. "As if there were  
(A string of) yellow camels  
(Marching swiftly).

34\. Ah woe, that Day,  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

35\. That will be a Day  
When they shall not

<span id="page_1668">p. 1668</span>

Be able to speak,

36\. Nor will it be  
Open to them  
To put forth pleas.

37\. Ah woe, that Day,  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

38\. That will be a Day  
Of Sorting out! We shall  
Gather you together  
And those before (you)!

39\. Now, if ye have  
A trick (or plot),  
Use it against Me!

40\. Ah woe, that Day,  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

##### SECTION 2.

41\. As to the Righteous,  
They shall be amidst  
(Cool) shades and springs  
(Of water),

<span id="page_1669">p. 1669</span>

42\. And (they shall have)  
Fruits,—all they desire.

43\. "Eat ye and drink ye  
To your heart's content:  
For that ye worked  
(Righteousness).

44\. Thus do We certainly  
Reward the Doers of Good.

45\. Ah woe, that Day,  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

46\. (O ye Unjust!)  
Eat ye and enjoy yourselves  
(But) a little while,  
For that ye are Sinners.

47\. Ah woe, that Day,  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

48\. And when it is said  
To them, "Prostrate yourselves!"  
They do not so.

<span id="page_1670">p. 1670</span>

49\. Ah woe, that Day,  
To the Rejecters of Truth!

50\. Then what Message,  
After that,  
Will they believe in?
