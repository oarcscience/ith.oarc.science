### Sūra XI.

### *Hūd* (The Prophet Hūd).

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. A. L. R.  
(This is) a Book,  
With verses basic or fundamental  
(Of established meaning),  
Further explained in detail,—  
From One Who is Wise  
And Well-Acquainted (with al\] things):

2\. (It teacheth) that ye should  
Worship none but God.  
(Say:) "Verily I am  
(Sent) unto you from Him  
To warn and to bring  
Glad tidings:

3\. "(And to preach thus), "Seek ye  
The forgiveness of your Lord,  
And turn to Him in repentance;  
That He may grant you  
Enjoyment, good (and true),  
For a term appointed,  
And bestow His abounding grace  
On all who abound in merit!  
But if ye turn away,  
Then I fear for you  
The Penalty of a Great Day:

4\. "'To God is your return,  
And He hath power  
Over all things.'"

5\. Behold! they fold up  
Their hearts, that they may lie  
Hid from Him! Ah! even  
When they cover themselves  
With their garments, He knoweth  
What they conceal, and what  
They reveal: for He knoweth  
Well the (inmost secrets)  
Of the hearts

<span id="page_515">p. 515</span>

6\. Where is no moving creature  
On earth but its sustenance  
Dependeth on God: He knoweth  
The time and place of its  
Definite abode and its  
Temporary deposit:  
All is in a clear Record.

7\. He it is Who created  
The heavens and the earth  
In six Days—and His Throne  
Was over the Waters—  
That He might try you,  
Which of you is best  
In conduct. But if  
Thou wert to say to them,  
"Ye shall indeed be raised up  
After death", the Unbelievers  
Would be sure to say,  
"This is nothing but  
Obvious sorcery!"

8\. If We delay the penalty  
For them for a definite term,  
They are sure to say,  
"What keeps it back?"

<span id="page_516">p. 516</span>

Ah! On the day it (actually)  
Reaches them, nothing will.  
Turn it away from them,  
And they will be completely  
Encircled by that which  
They used to mock at!

##### SECTION 2.

9\. If We give man a taste  
Of Mercy from Ourselves,  
And then withdraw it from him,  
Behold! he is in despair  
And (falls into) blasphemy.

10\. But if We give hint a taste  
Of (Our) favours after  
Adversity hath touched him,  
He is sure to say,  
"All evil has departed from me:  
Behold! he falls into exultation  
And pride.

11\. Not so do those who show  
Patience and constancy, and work  
Righteousness; for them  
Is forgiveness (of sins)  
And a great reward.

12\. Perchance thou mayest (feel  
The inclination) to give up  
A part of what is revealed  
Unto thee, and thy heart

<span id="page_517">p. 517</span>

Feeleth straitened lest they say,  
"Why is not a treasure sent down  
Unto him, or why does not  
An angel come down with him?"  
But thou art there only to warn!  
It is God that arrangeth  
All affairs!

13\. Or they may say, "He forged it."  
Say, "Bring ye then ten Sūras  
Forged, like unto it, and call  
(To your aid) whomsoever  
Ye can, other than God!—  
If ye speak the truth!

14\. "If then they (your false gods)  
Answer not your (call),  
Know ye that this Revelation  
Is sent down (replete) with the knowledge  
Of God, and that there is  
No god but He! Will ye  
Even then submit (to Islam)?"

15\. Those who desire  
The life of the Present  
And its glitter,—to them  
We shall pay (the price  
Of) their deeds therein,—  
Without diminution.

16\. They are those for whom  
There is nothing in the Hereafter  
But the Fire: vain  
Are the designs they frame therein,  
And of no effect  
Are the deeds that they do!

17\. Can they be (like) those  
Who accept a Clear (Sign)  
From their Lord, and whom  
A witness from Himself

<span id="page_518">p. 518</span>

Doth teach, as did the Book  
Of Moses before it,—a guide  
And a mercy? They believe  
Therein; but those of the Sects  
That reject it,—the Fire  
Will be their promised  
Meeting-place. Be not then  
In doubt thereon: for it is  
The Truth from thy Lord:  
Yet many among men  
Do not believe!

18\. Who doth more wrong  
Than those who invent a lie  
Against God? They will be  
Turned back to the presence  
Of their Lord, and the witnesses  
Will say, "These are the ones  
Who lied against their Lord!  
Behold! the Curse of God  
Is on those who do wrong!—

19\. "Those who would hinder (men)  
From the path of God  
And would seek in it  
Something crooked: these were  
They who denied the Hereafter!"

20\. They will in no wise  
Frustrate (His design) on earth,  
Nor have they protectors  
Besides God! Their penalty  
Will be doubled! They lost  
The power to hear,  
And they did not see!

21\. They are the ones who  
Have lost their own souls:

<span id="page_519">p. 519</span>

And the (fancies) they invented  
Have left them in the lurch!

22\. Without a doubt, these  
Are the very ones who  
Will lose most in the Hereafter!

23\. But those who believe  
And work righteousness,  
And humble themselves  
Before their Lord,—  
They will be Companions  
Of the Garden, to dwell  
Therein for aye!

24\. These two kinds (of men)  
May be compared to  
The blind and deaf,  
And those who can see  
And hear well. Are they  
Equal when compared?  
Will ye not then take heed?

##### SECTION 3.

25\. We sent Noah to his People  
(With a mission): "I have come  
To you with a Clear Warning:

26\. "That ye serve none but God:  
Verily I do fear for you

<span id="page_520">p. 520</span>

The Penalty of a Grievous Day."

27\. But the Chiefs of the Unbelievers  
Among his People said:  
"We see (in) thee nothing  
But a man like ourselves:  
Nor do we see that any  
Follow thee but the meanest  
Among us, in judgment immature:  
Nor do we see in you (all)  
Any merit above us:  
In fact we think ye are liars!"

28\. He said: "O my People!  
See ye if (it be that)  
I have a Clear Sign  
From my Lord, and that He  
Hath sent Mercy unto me  
From His own Presence, but  
That the Mercy hath been  
Obscured from your sight?  
Shall we compel you  
To accept it when ye  
Are averse to it?

29\. "And O my People!  
I ask you for no wealth

<span id="page_521">p. 521</span>

In return: my reward  
Is from none but God:  
But I will not drive away  
(In contempt) those who believe:  
For verily they are  
To meet their Lord, and ye  
I see are the ignorant ones!

30\. "And O my People!  
Who would help me against God  
If I drove them away?  
Will ye not then take heed?

31\. "I tell you not that  
With me are the Treasures  
Of God, nor do I know  
What is hidden,  
Nor claim I to be  
An angel. Nor yet  
Do I say, of those whom  
Your eyes do despise  
That God will not grant them  
(All) that is good:  
God knoweth best  
What is in their souls:  
I should, if I did,  
Indeed be a wrong-doer."

32\. They said: "O Noah!  
Thou hast disputed with us,

<span id="page_522">p. 522</span>

And (much) hast thou prolonged  
The dispute with us: now  
Bring upon us what thou  
Threatenest us with, if thou  
Speakest the truth!?"

33\. He said: "Truly, God  
Will bring it on you  
If He wills,—and then,  
Ye will not be able  
To frustrate it!

34\. "Of no profit will be  
My counsel to you,  
Much as I desire  
To give you (good) counsel,  
If it be that God  
Willeth to leave you astray:  
He is your Lord!  
And to Him will ye return!"

35\. Or do they say,  
"He has forged it "? Say:  
"If I had forged it,  
On me were my sin!  
And I am free  
Of the sins of which  
Ye are guilty!

<span id="page_523">p. 523</span>

##### SECTION 4.

36\. It was revealed to Noah:  
"None of thy People will believe  
Except those who have believed  
Already! So grieve no longer  
Over their (evil) deeds.

37\. "But construct an Ark  
Under Our eyes and Our  
Inspiration, and address Me  
No (further) on behalf  
Of those who are in sin:  
For they are about to be  
Overwhelmed (in the Flood)."

38\. Forthwith he (starts)  
Constructing the Ark:  
Every time that the Chiefs  
Of his People passed by him,  
They threw ridicule on him.  
He said: "If ye ridicule  
Us now, we (in our turn)  
Can look down on you  
With ridicule likewise!

39\. "But soon will ye know  
Who it is on whom  
Will descend a Penalty  
That will cover them

<span id="page_524">p. 524</span>

With shame,—on whom will be  
Unloosed a Penalty lasting:"

40\. At length, behold!  
There came Our Command,  
And the fountains of the earth  
Gushed forth! We said:  
"Embark therein, of each kind  
Two, male and female,  
And your family—except  
Those against whom the Word  
Has already gone forth,—  
And the Believers."  
But only a few  
Believed with him.

41\. So he said: "Embark ye  
On the Ark,  
In the name of God,  
Whether it move  
Or be at rest!  
For my Lord is, be sure,  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!"

42\. So the Ark floated  
With them on the waves  
(Towering) like mountains,  
And Noah called out  
To his son, who had  
Separated himself (from the rest):  
"O my son! embark  
With us, and be not  
With the Unbelievers!"

<span id="page_525">p. 525</span>

43\. The son replied: "I will  
Betake myself to some mountain:  
It will save me from  
The water." Noah said:  
"This day nothing can save,  
From the Command of God,  
Any but those on whom  
He hath mercy!"—  
And the waves came  
Between them, and the son  
Was among those  
Overwhelmed in the Flood.

44\. Then the word went forth:  
"O earth! swallow up  
Thy water, and O sky!  
Withhold (thy rain)!"  
And the water abated,  
And the matter was ended.  
The Ark rested on Mount  
Jūdī, and the word  
Went forth: "Away  
With those who do wrong!"

<span id="page_526">p. 526</span>

45\. And Noah called upon  
His Lord, and said:  
"O my Lord! surely  
My son is of my family!  
And Thy promise is true,  
And Thou art  
The Justest of Judges!"

46\. He said: "O Noah!  
He is not of thy family:  
For his conduct is unrighteous.  
So ask not of Me  
That of which thou  
Hast no knowledge!  
I give thee counsel, lest  
Thou act like the ignorant!"

47\. Noah said: "O my Lord!  
I do seek refuge with Thee,  
Lest I ask Thee for that  
Of which I have no knowledge.  
And unless Thou forgive me  
And have Mercy on me,  
I should indeed be lost!"

48\. The word came: "O Noah!  
Come down (from the Ark)  
With Peace from Us,  
And Blessing on thee  
And on some of the Peoples  
(Who will spring) from those  
With thee: but (there will be  
Other) Peoples to whom We  
Shall grant their pleasures  
(For a time), but in the end  
Will a grievous Penalty  
Reach them from Us."

<span id="page_527">p. 527</span>

49\. Such are some of the stories  
Of the Unseen, which We  
Have revealed unto thee:  
Before this, neither thou  
Nor thy People knew them.  
So persevere patiently:  
For the End is for those  
Who are righteous.

##### SECTION 5.

50\. To the ’Ād People  
(We sent) Hūd, one  
Of their own brethren.  
He said: "O my people!  
Worship God! ye have  
No other god but Him.  
(Your other gods) ye do nothing  
But invent!

51\. "O my people! I ask of you  
No reward for this (Message).  
My reward is from none  
But Him who created me:  
Will ye not then understand?

52\. "And O my people! Ask  
Forgiveness of your Lord,

<span id="page_528">p. 528</span>

And turn to Him (in repentance):  
He will send you the skies  
Pouring abundant rain,  
And add strength  
To your strength:  
So turn ye not back  
In sin!"

53\. They said: "O Hūd!  
No Clear (Sign) hast thou  
Brought us, and we are not  
The ones to desert our gods  
On thy word! Nor shall we  
Believe in thee!

54\. "We say nothing but that  
(Perhaps) some of our gods  
May have seized thee  
With imbecility." He said:  
"I call God to witness,  
And do ye bear witness,  
That I am free from the sin  
Of ascribing, to Him,

<span id="page_529">p. 529</span>

55\. "Other gods as partners!  
So scheme (your worst) against me,  
All of you, and give me  
No respite.

56\. "I put my trust in God,  
My Lord and your Lord!  
There is not a moving  
Creature, but He hath  
Grasp of its fore-lock.  
Verily, it is my Lord  
That is on a straight Path.

57\. "If ye turn away,—  
I (at least) have conveyed  
The Message with which I  
Was sent to you. My Lord  
Will make another People  
To succeed you, and you  
Will not harm Him  
In the least. For my Lord  
Hath care and watch  
Over all things."

58\. So when Our decree  
Issued, We saved Hūd  
And those who believed  
With him, by (special) Grace  
From Ourselves: We saved them  
From a severe Penalty.

59\. Such were the ’Ād People:  
They rejected the Signs

<span id="page_530">p. 530</span>

Of their Lord and Cherisher;  
Disobeyed His Apostles;  
And followed the command  
Of every powerful, obstinate  
Transgressor.

60\. And they were pursued  
By a Curse in this Life,  
And on the Day of Judgment.  
Ah! Behold! For the ’Ād  
Rejected their Lord and Cherisher  
Ah! Behold! Removed (from sight)  
Were ’Ād the People of Hūd!

##### SECTION 6.

61\. To the Thamūd People  
(We sent) Sālih, one  
Of their own brethren.  
He said: "O my People!  
Worship God: ye have  
No other God but Him.  
It is He Who hath produced you  
From the earth and settled you  
Therein: then ask forgiveness  
Of Him, and turn to Him  
(In repentance): for my Lord  
Is (always) near, ready  
To answer."

62\. They said: "O Sālib!  
Thou hast been of us!—

<span id="page_531">p. 531</span>

A centre of our hopes  
Hitherto! Dost thou (now)  
Forbid us the worship  
Of what our fathers worshipped?  
But we are really  
In suspicious (disquieting)  
Doubt as to that to which  
Thou invitest us."

63\. He said: "O my people!  
Do ye see?—If I have  
A Clear (Sign) from my Lord  
And He hath sent Mercy  
Unto me from Himself,—who  
Then can help me  
Against God if I were  
To disobey Him? What  
Then would ye add  
To my (portion) but perdition?

64\. "And O my people!  
This she-camel of God is  
A symbol to you:  
Leave her to feed  
On God's (free) earth,  
And inflict no harm  
On her, or a swift Penalty  
Will seize you!"

65\. But they did ham-string her.  
So he said: "Enjoy yourselves  
In your homes for three days:  
(Then will be your ruin):

<span id="page_532">p. 532</span>

(Behold) there a promise  
Not to be belied!"

66\. When Our Decree issued,  
We saved Sālib and those  
Who believed with him,  
By (special) Grace from  
Ourselves—  
And from the Ignominy  
Of that Day. For thy Lord—  
He is the Strong One, and Able  
To enforce His Will.

67\. The (mighty) Blast overtook  
The wrong-doers, and they  
Lay prostrate in their homes  
Before the morning,—

68\. As if they had never  
Dwelt and flourished there.  
Ah! Behold! For the Thamūd  
Rejected their Lord and Cherisher!  
Ah! Behold! Removed  
(From sight) were the Thamūd!

##### SECTION 7.

69\. There came Our Messengers  
To Abraham with glad tidings.

<span id="page_533">p. 533</span>

They said, "Peace!" He answered,  
"Peace!" and hastened  
To entertain them  
With a roasted calf.

70\. But when he saw  
Their hands went not  
Towards the (meal), he felt  
Some mistrust of them,  
And conceived a fear of them.  
They said: "Fear not:  
We have been sent  
Against the people of Lūt."

71\. And his wife was standing  
(There), and she laughed:  
But We gave her  
Glad tidings of Isaac,  
And after him, of Jacob.

<span id="page_534">p. 534</span>

72\. She said: "Alas for me!  
Shall I bear a [child](errata.htm#3.md),  
Seeing I am an old woman,  
And my husband here  
Is an old man?  
That would indeed  
Be a wonderful thing!"

73\. They said: "Dost thou  
Wonder at God's decree?  
The grace of God  
And His blessings on you,  
O ye people of the house!  
For He is indeed  
Worthy of all praise,  
Full of all glory!"

74\. When fear had passed  
From (the mind of) Abraham  
And the glad tidings  
Had reached him, he  
Began to plead with Us  
For Lūt's people.

75\. For Abraham was,  
Without doubt, forbearing  
(Of faults), compassionate,  
And given to look to God.

76\. O Abraham! Seek not this.  
The decree of thy Lord  
Hath gone forth: for them  
There cometh a Penalty

<span id="page_535">p. 535</span>

That cannot be turned back!

77\. When Our Messengers  
Came to Lūt, he was  
Grieved on their account  
And felt himself powerless  
(To protect) them. He said:  
"This is a distressful day."

78\. And his people came  
Rushing towards him,  
And they had been long  
In the habit of practising  
Abominations. He said:  
"O my people! Here are  
My daughters: they are purer  
For you (if ye marry)!  
Now fear God, and cover me not  
With shame about my guests!  
Is there not among you  
A single right-minded man?"

79\. They said: "Well dost thou  
Know we have no need  
Of thy daughters: indeed  
Thou knowest quite well  
What we want!"

80\. He said: "Would that I  
Had power to suppress you

<span id="page_536">p. 536</span>

Or that I could betake  
Myself to some powerful support."

81\. (The Messengers) said: "O Lūt  
We are Messengers from thy Lord!  
By no means shall they  
Reach thee! Now travel  
With thy family while yet  
A part of the night remains,  
And let not any of you  
Look back: but thy wife  
(Will remain behind):  
To her will happen  
What happens to the people.  
Morning is their time appointed:  
Is not the morning nigh?"

82\. When Our decree issued,  
We turned (the cities)  
Upside down, and rained down  
On them brimstones  
Hard as baked clay,  
Spread, layer on layer,—

83\. Marked as from thy Lord:

<span id="page_537">p. 537</span>

Nor are they ever far  
From those who do wrong!

##### SECTION 8.

84\. To the Madyan people  
(We sent) Shu’aib, one  
Of their own brethren: he said:  
"O my people! worship God:  
Ye have no other god  
But Him. And give not  
Short measure or weight:  
I see you in prosperity,  
But I fear for you  
The Penalty of a Day  
That will compass (you) all round.

85\. "And O my people! give  
Just measure and weight,  
Nor withhold from the people  
The things that are their due:  
Commit not evil in the land  
With intent to do mischief.

86\. "That which is left you  
By God is best for you,

<span id="page_538">p. 538</span>

If ye (but) believed!  
But I am not set  
Over you to keep watch!"

87\. They said: "O Shu’aib!  
Does thy (religion of) prayer  
Command thee that we  
Leave off the worship which  
Our fathers practised, or  
That we leave off doing  
What we like with our property?  
Truly, thou art the one  
That forbeareth with faults  
And is right-minded!"

88\. He said: "O my people!  
See ye whether I hate  
A Clear (Sign) from my Lord,  
And He hath given me  
Sustenance (pure and) good  
As from Himself? I wish not,  
In opposition to you, to do  
That which I forbid you to do.  
I only desire (your) betterment  
To the best of my power;  
And my success (in my task)  
Can only come from God.  
In Him I trust,  
And unto Him I look.

89\. "And O my people!  
Let not my dissent (from you)

<span id="page_539">p. 539</span>

Cause you to sin,  
Lest ye suffer  
A fate similar to that  
Of the people of Noah  
Or of Hūd or of Sālib,  
Nor are the people of Lūt  
Far off from you!

90\. "But ask forgiveness  
Of your Lord, and turn  
Unto Him (in repentance):  
For my Lord is indeed  
Full of mercy and loving-kindness."

91\. They said: "O Shu’aib!  
Much of what thou sayest  
We do not understand!  
In fact among us we see  
That thou hast no strength!  
Were it not for thy family,  
We should certainly  
Have stoned thee!  
For thou hast among us  
No great position!"

92\. He said: "O my people!  
Is then my family  
Of more consideration with you  
Than God? For ye cast Him  
Away behind your backs  
(With contempt). But verily  
My Lord encompasseth  
On all sides  
All that ye do!

93\. "And O my people!  
Do whatever ye can:

<span id="page_540">p. 540</span>

I will do (my part):  
Soon will ye know  
Who it is on whom  
Descends the Penalty  
Of ignominy, and who  
Is a liar!  
And watch ye!  
For I too am watching  
With you!"

94\. When Our decree issued,  
We saved Shu’aib and those  
Who believed with him,  
By (special) Mercy from Ourselves  
But the (mighty) Blast did seize  
The wrong-doers, and they  
Lay prostrate in their homes  
By the morning,—

95\. As if they had never  
Dwelt and flourished there!  
Ah! Behold! How the Madyan  
Were removed (from sight)  
As were removed the <u>Th</u>amūd!

<span id="page_541">p. 541</span>

##### SECTION 9.

96\. And we sent Moses,  
With our Clear (signs)  
And an authority manifest,

97\. Unto Pharaoh and his Chiefs:  
But they followed the command  
Of Pharaoh, and the command  
Of Pharaoh was no right (guide).

98\. He will go before his people  
On the Day of Judgment,  
And lead them into the Fire  
(As cattle are led to water):  
But woeful indeed will be  
The place to which they are led!

99\. And they are followed  
By a curse in this (life)  
And on the Day of Judgment:  
And woeful is the gift  
Which shall be given  
(Unto them)!

100\. These are some of the stories  
Of communities which We  
Relate unto thee: of them  
Some are standing, and some

<span id="page_542">p. 542</span>

Have been mown down  
(By the sickle of time.

101\. It was not We that wronged them:  
They wronged their own souls:  
The deities, other than God,  
Whom they invoked, profited them  
No whit when there issued  
The decree of thy Lord:  
Nor did they add aught  
(To their lot) but perdition!

102\. Such is the chastisement  
Of thy Lord when He chastises  
Communities in the midst of  
Their wrong: grievous, indeed,  
And severe is His chastisement.

103\. In that is a Sign  
For those who fear  
The Penalty of the Hereafter:  
That is a Day for which mankind  
Will be gathered together:  
That will be a Day  
Of Testimony.

104\. Nor shall We delay it  
But for a term appointed.

105\. The day it arrives,  
No soul shall speak

<span id="page_543">p. 543</span>

Except by His leave:  
Of those (gathered) some  
Will be wretched and some  
Will be blessed.

106\. Those who are wretched  
Shall be in the Fire:  
There will be for them  
Therein (nothing but) the heaving  
Of sighs and sobs:

107\. They will dwell therein  
For all the time that  
The heavens and the earth  
Endure, except as thy Lord  
Willeth: for thy Lord  
Is the (sure) Accomplisher  
Of what He planneth.

108\. And those who are blessed  
Shall be in the Garden:  
They will dwell therein  
For all the time that  
The heavens and the earth  
Endure, except as thy Lord  
Willeth: a gift without break.

<span id="page_544">p. 544</span>

109\. Be not then in doubt  
As to what these men  
Worship. They worship nothing  
But what their fathers worshipped  
Before (them): but verily  
We shall pay them back  
(In full) their portion  
Without (the least) abatement.

##### SECTION 10.

110\. We certainly gave the Book  
To Moses, but differences  
Arose therein: had it not been  
That a Word had gone forth  
Before from thy Lord, the matter  
Would have been decided  
Between them: but they  
Are in suspicious doubt  
Concerning it.

111\. And, of a surety, to all  
Will your Lord pay back  
(In full the recompense)  
Of their deeds: for He  
Knoweth well all that they do.

112\. Therefore stand firm (in the straight  
Path) as thou art commanded,—

<span id="page_545">p. 545</span>

Thou and those who with thee  
Turn (unto God); and transgress not  
(From the Path): for He seeth  
Well all that ye do.

113\. And incline not to those  
Who do wrong, or the Fire  
Will seize you; and ye have  
No protectors other than God,  
Nor shall ye be helped.

114\. And establish regular prayers  
At the two ends of the day  
And at the approaches of the night:  
For those things that are good  
Remove those that are evil:  
Be that the word of remembrance  
To those who remember (their Lord):

115\. And be steadfast in patience;  
For verily God will not suffer  
The reward of the righteous  
To perish.

116\. Why were there not,  
Among the generations before you,  
Persons possessed of balanced  
Good sense, prohibiting (men)

<span id="page_546">p. 546</span>

From mischief in the earth—  
Except a few among them  
Whom We saved (from harm)?  
But the wrong-doers pursued  
The enjoyment of the good things  
Of life which were given them,  
And persisted in sin.

117\. Nor would thy Lord be  
The One to destroy  
Communities for a single wrong-doing,  
If its members were likely  
To mend.

118\. If thy Lord had so willed,  
He could have made mankind  
One People: but they  
Will not cease to dispute,

119\. Except those on whom thy Lord  
Hath bestowed His Mercy:  
And for this did He create  
Them: and the Word  
Of thy Lord shall be fulfilled:  
"I will fill Hell with jinns  
And men all together."

<span id="page_547">p. 547</span>

120\. All that we relate to thee  
Of the stories of the apostles,—  
With it We make firm  
Thy heart: in them there cometh  
To thee the Truth, as well as  
An exhortation and a message  
Of remembrance to those who believe.

121\. Say to those who do not  
Believe: "Do whatever ye can:  
We shall do our part;

122\. "And wait ye!  
We too shall wait."

123\. To God do belong  
The unseen (secrets)  
Of the heavens and the earth,  
And to Him goeth back  
Every affair (for decision)  
Then worship Him,  
And put thy trust in Him .  
And thy Lord is not  
Unmindful of aught  
That ye do.
