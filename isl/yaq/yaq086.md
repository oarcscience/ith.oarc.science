### Sūra LXXXVI.

### *Ṭāriq,* or The Night-Visitant.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. By the Sky  
And the Night-Visitant  
(Therein);—

2\. And what will explain to thee  
What the Night-Visitant is?—

3\. (It is) the Star  
Of piercing brightness;—

4\. There is no soul but has  
A protector over it.

5\. Now let man but think  
From what he is created!

6\. He is created from  
A drop emitted—

7\. Proceeding from between  
The backbone and the ribs:

8\. Surely (God) is able  
To bring him back  
(To life)!

9\. The Day that  
(All) things secret  
Will be tested,

10\. (Man) will have  
No power,  
And no helper.

11\. By the Firmament  
Which returns (in its round),

12\. And by the Earth  
Which opens out  
(For the gushing of springs  
Or the sprouting of vegetation),—

13\. Behold this is the Word  
That distinguishes (Good  
From Evil):

14\. It is not a thing  
For amusement.

<span id="page_1721">p. 1721</span>

15\. As for them, they  
Are but plotting a scheme,

16\. And I am planning  
A scheme.

17\. Therefore grant a delay  
To the unbelievers:  
Give respite to them  
Gently (for awhile).
