### Sūra LXV.

### *Ṭalāq,* or Divorce.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. O Prophet! When ye  
Do divorce women,  
Divorce them at their  
Prescribed periods,  
And count (accurately)  
Their prescribed periods:  
And fear God your Lord:  
And turn them not out  
Of their houses, nor shall  
They (themselves) leave,  
Except in case they are  
Guilty of some open lewdness,  
Those are limits  
Set by God: and any  
Who transgresses the limits  
Of God, does verily  
Wrong his (own) soul:  
Thou knowest not if

<span id="page_1563">p. 1563</span>

Perchance God will  
Bring about thereafter  
Some new situation.

2\. Thus when they fulfil  
Their term appointed,  
Either take them back  
On equitable terms  
Or part with them  
On equitable terms;  
And take for witness  
Two persons from among you,  
Endued with justice,  
And establish the evidence  
(As) before God. Such  
Is the admonition given  
To him who believes  
In God and the Last Day.  
And for those who fear  
God, He (ever) prepares  
A way out,

3\. And He provides for him  
From (sources) he never  
Could imagine. And if  
Any one puts his trust  
In God, sufficient is (God)  
For him. For God will

<span id="page_1564">p. 1564</span>

Surely accomplish His purpose:  
Verily, for all things  
Has God appointed  
A due proportion.

4\. Such of your women  
As have passed the age  
Of monthly courses, for them  
The prescribed period, if ye  
Have any doubts, is  
Three months, and for those  
Who have no courses  
(It is the same):  
For those who carry  
(Life within their wombs),  
Their period is until  
They deliver their burdens:  
And for those who  
Fear God, He will  
Make their path easy.

5\. That is the Command  
Of God, which He  
Has sent down to you:  
And if any one fears God,  
He will remove his ills  
From him, and will enlarge  
His reward.

6\. Let the women live  
(In *‘iddat*) in the same

<span id="page_1565">p. 1565</span>

Style as ye live,  
According to your means:  
Annoy them not, so as  
To restrict them.  
And if they carry (life  
In their wombs), then  
Spend (your substance) on them  
Until they deliver  
Their burden: and if  
They suckle your (offspring),  
Give them their recompense:  
And take mutual counsel  
Together, according to  
What is just and reasonable.  
And if ye find yourselves  
In difficulties, let another  
Woman suckle (the child)  
On the (father's) behalf.

7\. Let the man of means  
Spend according to  
His means: and the man  
Whose resources are restricted,  
Let him spend according  
To what God has given him.  
God puts no burden  
On any person beyond  
What He has given him.  
After a difficulty, God  
Will soon grant relief.

##### SECTION 2.

8\. How many populations  
That insolently opposed  
The command of their Lord  
And of His apostles,  
Did We not then  
Call to account,  
To severe account?  
And We imposed on them  
An exemplary Punishment.

9\. Then did they taste  
The evil result of  
Their conduct, and the End  
Of their conduct  
Was Perdition.

10\. God has prepared for them  
A severe Punishment  
(In the Hereafter).  
Therefore fear God,  
O ye men of understanding—  
Who have believed!  
For God hath indeed  
Sent down to you  
A Message,—

11\. An Apostle, who rehearses  
To you the Signs of God  
Containing clear explanations,  
That he may lead forth  
Those who believe  
And do righteous deeds

<span id="page_1567">p. 1567</span>

From the depths of Darkness  
Into Light. And those who  
Believe in God and work  
Righteousness, He will admit  
To Gardens beneath which rivers  
Flow, to dwell therein  
For ever: God has indeed  
Granted for them  
A most excellent provision.

12\. God is He Who  
Created seven Firmaments  
And of the earth  
A similar number.  
Through the midst  
Of them (all) descends  
His Command: that ye may  
Know that God has power  
Over all things, and that  
God comprehends all things  
In (His) Knowledge.
