### Sūra LXXXIV.

### *Inshiqāq,* or The Rending Asunder.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. When the Sky is  
Rent asunder,

2\. And hearkens to  
(The Command of) its Lord,—  
And it must needs  
(Do so);—

3\. And when the Earth  
Is flattened out,

4\. And casts forth  
What is within it  
And becomes (clean) empty,

5\. And hearkens to  
(The Command of) its Lord,—  
And it must needs  
(Do so);—(then will come  
Home the full Reality)

6\. O thou man!  
Verily thou art ever  
Toiling on towards thy Lord—  
Painfully toiling,—but thou  
Shalt meet Him.

7\. Then he who is given  
His Record in his  
Right hand,

8\. Soon will his account  
Be taken by an easy reckoning,

9\. And he will turn  
To his people, rejoicing!

10\. But he who is given  
His Record behind his back,—

11\. Soon will he cry  
For Perdition,

12\. And he will enter  
A Blazing Fire.

13\. Truly, did he go about  
Among his people, rejoicing!

<span id="page_1711">p. 1711</span>

14\. Truly, did he think  
That he would not  
Have to return (to Us)!

15\. Nay, nay! for his Lord  
Was (ever) watchful of him!

16\. So I do call  
To witness the ruddy glow  
Of Sunset;

17\. The Night and its Homing;

18\. And the Moon  
In her Fulness:

19\. Ye shall surely travel  
From stage to stage

<span id="page_1712">p. 1712</span>

20\. What then is the matter  
With them, that they  
Believe not?—

21\. And when the Qur-ān  
Is read to them, they  
Fall not prostrate,

22\. But on the contrary  
The Unbelievers reject (it).

23\. But God has full Knowledge  
Of what they secrete  
(In their breasts).

24\. So announce to them  
A Penalty Grievous,

25\. Except to those who believe  
And work righteous deeds:  
For them is a Reward  
That will never fail.
