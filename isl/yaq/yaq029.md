### Sūra XXIX.

### *‘Ankabūt*, or the Spider

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. A. L. M.

2\. Do men think that  
They will he left alone  
On saying, "We believe",  
And that they will not  
Be tested?

3\. We did test those  
Before them, and God will  
Certainly know those who are  
True from those who are false.

4\. Do those who practise  
Evil think that they  
Will get the better of us?  
Evil is their judgment!

5\. For those whose hopes are  
in the meeting with God  
(In the Hereafter, let them strive);  
For the Term (appointed)

<span id="page_1030">p. 1030</span>

By God is surely coming:  
And He hears and knows  
(All things).

6\. And if any strive (with might  
And main), they do so  
For their own souls:  
For God is free of all  
Needs from all creation.

7\. Whose who believe and work  
Righteous deeds,—from them  
Shall We blot out all evil  
(That may be) in them,  
And We shall reward  
Them according to  
The best of their deeds.

8\. We have enjoined on man  
Kindness to parents: but if  
They (either of them) strive  
(To force) thee to join  
With Me (in worship)  
Anything of which thou hast  
No knowledge, obey them not.  
Ye have (all) to return  
To Me, and I will  
Tell you (the truth)  
Of all that ye did.

<span id="page_1031">p. 1031</span>

9\. And those who believe  
And work righteous deeds,—  
Them shall We admit  
To the company of the Righteous.

10\. Then there are among men  
Such as say, "We believe  
In God"; but when they suffer  
Affliction in (the cause of) God,  
They treat men's oppression  
As if it were the Wrath  
Of God! And if help  
Comes (to thee) from thy Lord,  
They are sure to say,'  
"We have (always) been  
With you!" Does not God  
Know best all that is  
In the hearts of all Creation?

11\. And God most certainly knows  
Those who believe, and as certainly  
Those who are Hypocrites.

12\. And the Unbelievers say  
To those who believe:  
"Follow our path, and we  
Will bear (the consequences)"  
Of your faults." Never  
In the least will they  
Bear their faults: in fact  
They are liars!

<span id="page_1032">p. 1032</span>

13\. They will bear their own  
Burdens, and (other) burdens  
Along with their own,  
And on the Day of Judgment.  
They will be called to account  
For their falsehoods.

##### SECTION 2.

14\. We (once) sent Noah  
To his people, and he tarried  
Among them a thousand years  
Less fifty: but the Deluge  
Overwhelmed them while they  
(Persisted in) sin.

15\. But We saved him  
And the Companions  
Of the Ark, and We made  
The (Ark) a Sign  
For all Peoples!

16\. And (We also saved)  
Abraham: behold, he said  
To his people, "Serve God  
And fear Him: that  
Will be best for you  
If ye understand!

17\. "For ye do worship idols  
Besides God, and ye invent  
Falsehood. The things that ye  
Worship besides God have  
No power to give you sustenance:

<span id="page_1033">p. 1033</span>

Then seek ye sustenance  
From God, serve Him,  
And be grateful to Him:  
To Him will be your return.

18\. "And if ye reject (the Message),  
So did generations before you:  
And the duty of the apostle  
Is only to preach publicly  
(And clearly)."

19\. See they not how God  
Originates creation, then  
Repeats it: truly that  
Is easy for God.

20\. Say: "Travel through the earth  
And see how God did  
Originate creation; so will  
God produce a later creation:  
For God has power  
Over all things.

21\. "He punishes whom He pleases,  
And He grants mercy to whom

<span id="page_1034">p. 1034</span>

He pleases, and towards Him  
Are ye turned.

22\. "Not on earth nor in heaven  
Will ye be able (fleeing)  
To frustrate (His Plan),  
Nor have ye, besides God,  
Any protector or helper."

##### SECTION 3.

23\. Those who reject the Signs  
Of God and the Meeting  
With Him (in the Hereafter),  
It is they who shall despair  
Of My mercy: it is they  
Who will (suffer)  
A most grievous Penalty.

24\. So naught was the answer  
Of (Abraham's) people except  
That they said: "Slay him  
Or burn him." But God  
Did save him from the Fire  
Verily in this are Signs  
For people who believe.

25\. And he said: "For you,  
Ye have taken (for worship)  
Idols besides God, out of  
Mutual love and regard

<span id="page_1035">p. 1035</span>

Between yourselves in this life;  
But on the Day of Judgment  
Ye shall disown each other  
And curse each other:  
And your abode will be  
The Fire, and ye shall have  
None to help."

26\. But Lūṭ had faith in Him:  
He said: "I will leave  
Home for the sake of  
My Lord: for He is  
Exalted in Might, and Wise."

27\. And We gave (Abraham)  
Isaac and Jacob, and ordained  
Among his progeny Prophethood  
And Revelation, and We  
Granted him his reward  
In this life; and he was  
In the Hereafter (of the company)  
Of the Righteous.

28\. And (remember) Lūṭ: behold,  
He said to his people:

<span id="page_1036">p. 1036</span>

"Ye do commit lewdness,  
Such as no people in Creation  
(Ever) committed before you.

29\. "Do ye indeed approach men,  
And cut off the highway?  
And practise wickedness  
(Even) in your councils?"  
But his people gave no answer  
But this: they said:  
"Bring us the Wrath of God  
If thou tellest the truth."

30\. He said: "O my Lord!  
Help Thou me against people  
Who do mischief!"

##### SECTION 4.

31\. When Our Messengers came  
To Abraham with the good news,  
They said: "We are indeed  
Going to destroy the people  
Of this township: for truly  
They are (addicted to) crime."

<span id="page_1037">p. 1037</span>

32\. He said: "But there is  
Lūṭ there." They said:  
"Well do we know who  
Is there: we will certainly  
Save him and his following,—  
Except his wife: she is  
Of those who lag behind!"

33\. And when Our Messengers  
Came to Lūṭ, he was  
Grieved on their account,  
And felt himself powerless  
(To protect) them: but they said:  
"Fear thou not, nor grieve:  
We are (here) to save thee  
And thy following, except  
Thy wife: she is  
Of those who lag behind.

34\. "For we are going to  
Bring down on the people  
Of this township a Punishment  
From heaven, because they  
Have been wickedly rebellious."

35\. And We have left thereof  
An evident Sign,  
For any people who  
(Care to) understand.

<span id="page_1038">p. 1038</span>

36\. To the Madyan (people)  
(We sent) their brother Shu‘aib.  
Then he said: "O my people!  
Serve God, and fear the Last  
Day: nor commit evil  
On the earth, with intent  
To do mischief."

37\. But they rejected him:  
Then the mighty Blast  
Seized them, and they lay  
Prostrate in their homes  
By the morning.

38\. (Remember also) the ’Ad  
And the <u>Th</u>amūd (people):  
Clearly will appear to you  
From (the traces) of their buildings  
(Their fate): the Evil One  
Made their deeds alluring  
To them, and kept them hack  
From the Path, though they  
Were gifted with Intelligence  
And Skill.

<span id="page_1039">p. 1039</span>

39\. (Remember also) Qārūn,  
Pharaoh, and Haman: there came  
To them Moses with Clear Signs,  
But they behaved with insolence  
On the earth; yet they  
Could not overreach (Us).

40\. Each one of them We seized  
For his crime: of them,  
Against some We sent  
A violent tornado (with showers  
Of stones); some were caught  
By a (mighty) Blast; some  
We caused the earth  
To swallow up; and some  
We drowned (in the waters):  
It was net God Who  
Injured (or oppressed) them:  
They injured (and oppressed)  
Their own souls.

41\. The parable of those who  
Take protectors other than God  
Is that of the Spider,  
Who builds (to itself)

<span id="page_1040">p. 1040</span>

A house; but truly  
The flimsiest of houses  
Is the Spider's house;—  
If they but knew.

42\. Verily God doth know  
Of (every thing) whatever  
That they call upon  
Besides Him: and He is  
Exalted (in power), Wise.

43\. And such are the Parables  
We set forth for mankind,  
But only those understand them  
Who have Knowledge.

44\. God created the heavens  
And the earth in true (proportions):  
Verily in that is a Sign  
For those who believe.

<span id="page_1041">p. 1041</span>

##### SECTION 5.

45\. Recite what is sent  
Of the Book by inspiration  
To thee, and establish  
Regular Prayer: for Prayer  
Restrains from shameful  
And unjust deeds;  
And remembrance of God  
Is the greatest (thing in life)  
Without doubt. And God knows  
The (deeds) that ye do.

46\. And dispute ye not  
With the People of the Book,  
Except with means better  
(Than mere disputation), unless  
It be with those of them  
Who inflict wrong (and injury):  
But say, "We believe  
In the Revelation which has  
Come down to us and in that  
Which came down to you;

<span id="page_1042">p. 1042</span>

Our God and your God  
Is One; and it is to Him  
We bow (in Islam)."

47\. And thus (it is) that We  
Have sent down the Book  
To thee. So the People  
Of the Book believe therein,  
As also do some of these  
(Pagan Arabs): and none  
But Unbelievers reject Our Signs.

48\. And thou vast not (able)  
To recite a Book before  
This (Book came), nor art thou  
(Able) to transcribe it  
With thy right hand:  
In that case, indeed, would

<span id="page_1043">p. 1043</span>

The talkers of vanities  
Have doubted.

49\. Nay, here are Signs  
Self-evident in the hearts  
Of those endowed with  
knowledge:  
And none but the unjust  
Reject Our Signs.

50\. Yet they say: "Why  
Are not Signs sent down  
To him from his Lord?"  
Say: "The Signs are indeed  
With God: and I am  
Indeed a clear Warner.

51\. And is it not enough  
For them that We have  
Sent down to thee  
The Book which is rehearsed  
To them? Verily, in it  
Is Mercy and a Reminder  
To those who believe.

##### SECTION 6.

52\. Say: "Enough is God  
For a Witness between me

<span id="page_1044">p. 1044</span>

And you: He knows  
What is in the heavens  
And on earth. And it is  
Those who believe in vanities  
And reject God, that  
Will perish (in the end).

53\. They ask thee  
To hasten on the Punishment  
(For them): had it not been  
For a term (of respite)  
Appointed, the Punishment  
Would certainly have come  
To them: and it will  
Certainly reach them,—  
Of a sudden, while they  
Perceive not!

54\. They ask thee  
To hasten on the Punishment:  
But, of a surety,  
Hell will encompass  
The rejecters of Faith!—

55\. On the Day that  
The Punishment shall cover them  
From above them and  
From below them,  
And (a Voice) shall say:  
"Taste ye (the fruits)  
Of your deeds!

<span id="page_1045">p. 1045</span>

56\. O My servants who believe!  
Truly, spacious is My Earth:  
Therefore serve ye Me—  
(And Me alone)!

57\. Every soul shall have  
A taste of death:  
In the end to Us  
Shall ye be brought back.

58\. But those who believe  
And work deeds of righteousness—  
To them shall We give  
A Home in Heaven,—  
Lofty mansions beneath which  
Flow rivers,—to dwell therein  
For aye;—an excellent reward  
For those who do (good)!—

59\. Those who persevere in patience,  
And put their trust  
In their Lord and Cherisher.

60\. How many are the creatures  
That carry not their own

<span id="page_1046">p. 1046</span>

Sustenance? It is God  
Who feeds (both) them and you:  
For He hears and knows  
(All things).

61\. If indeed thou ask them  
Who has created the heavens  
And the earth and subjected  
The sun and the moon  
(To His Law), they will  
Certainly reply, "God".  
How are they then deluded  
Away (from the truth)?

62\. God enlarges the sustenance  
(Which He gives) to whichever  
Of His servants He pleases;  
And He (similarly) grants  
By (strict) measure, (as He pleases):  
For God has full knowledge  
Of all things.

63\. And if indeed thou ask them  
Who it is that sends down  
Rain from the sky,  
And gives life therewith  
To the earth after its death,  
They will certainly reply,  
"God!" Say, "Praise be  
To God!" But most  
Of them understand not.

<span id="page_1047">p. 1047</span>

##### SECTION 7.

64\. What is the life of this world  
But amusement and play?  
But verily the Home  
In the Hereafter,—that is  
Life indeed, if they but knew.

65\. Now, if they embark  
On a boat, they call  
On God, making their devotion  
Sincerely (and exclusively) to Him;  
But when He has delivered  
Them safely to (dry) land,  
Behold, they give a share  
(Of their worship to others)!—

66\. Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts,  
And giving themselves up  
To (worldly) enjoyment! But soon  
Will they know.

67\. Do they not then see  
That We have made  
A Sanctuary secure, and that  
Men are being snatched away  
From all around them?  
Then, do they believe in that

<span id="page_1048">p. 1048</span>

Which is vain, and reject  
The Grace of God?

68\. And who does more wrong  
Than he who invents  
A lie against God  
Or rejects the Truth  
When it reaches him?  
Is there not a home  
In Hell for those who  
Reject Faith?

69\. And those who strive  
In Our (Cause),—We will  
Certainly guide them  
To Our Paths:  
For verily God  
Is with those  
Who do right.
