### Sūra XX.

### *Ṭā-Hā.* (Mystic Letters, Ṭ. H.)

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Ṭā-Hā.*

2\. We have not sent down  
The Qur-ān to thee to be  
(An occasion) for thy distress,

3\. But only as an admonition  
To those who fear (God),—

4\. A revelation from Him  
Who created the earth  
And the heavens on high.

5\. (God) Most Gracious  
Is firmly established  
On the throne (of authority).

6\. To Him belongs what is  
In the heavens and on earth,  
And all between them,  
And all beneath the soil.

7\. If thou pronounce the word  
Aloud, (it is no matter):

<span id="page_791">p. 791</span>

For verily He knoweth  
What is secret and what  
Is yet more hidden.

8\. God! there is no god  
But He! To Him belong  
The Most Beautiful Names.

9\. Has the story of Moses  
Reached thee?

10\. Behold, he saw a fire:  
So he said to his family,

<span id="page_792">p. 792</span>

"Tarry ye; I perceive  
A fire; perhaps I can  
Bring you some burning brand  
Therefrom, or find some guidance  
At the fire."

11\. But when he came  
To the fire, a voice  
Was heard: "O Moses!

12\. "Verily I am thy Lord!  
Therefore (in My presence)  
Put off thy shoes: thou art  
In the sacred valley Ṭuwā

13\. "I have chosen thee:  
Listen, then, to the inspiration  
(Sent to thee).

14\. "Verily, I am God:  
There is no god but I:  
So serve thou Me (only),  
And establish regular prayer  
For celebrating My praise.

15\. "Verily the Hour is coming—  
My design is to keep it

<span id="page_793">p. 793</span>

Hidden—for every soul  
To receive its reward  
By the measure of  
Its Endeavour.

16\. "Therefore let not such as  
Believe not therein  
But follow their own  
Lusts, divert thee therefrom,  
Lest thou perish!"…

17\. "And what is that  
In thy right hand,  
O Moses?"

18\. He said, "It is  
My rod: on it  
I lean; with it  
I beat down fodder  
For my flocks; and  
In it I find  
Other uses."

19\. (God) said, "Throw it,  
O Moses!"

20\. He threw it, and behold!  
It was a snake,  
Active in motion.

<span id="page_794">p. 794</span>

21\. (God) said, "Seize it,  
And fear not: We  
Shall return it at once  
To its former condition"…

22\. "Now draw thy hand  
Close to thy side:  
It shall come forth white  
(And shining), without harm  
(Or stain),—as another Sign,—

23\. "In order that We  
May show thee  
(Two) of our Greater Signs.

24\. "Go thou to Pharaoh,  
For he has indeed  
Transgressed all bounds."

##### SECTION 2.

25\. (Moses) said: "O my Lord!  
Expand me my breast;

26\. "Ease my task for me;

27\. "And remove the impediment  
From my speech,

28\. "So they may understand  
What I say:

<span id="page_795">p. 795</span>

29\. "And give me a Minister  
From my family,

30\. "Aaron, my brother;

31\. "Add to my strength  
Through him,

32\. "And make him share  
My task:

33\. "That we may celebrate  
Thy praise without stint,

34\. "And remember Thee  
Without stint:

35\. "For Thou art He  
That (ever) regardeth us."

36\. (God) said: "Granted  
Is thy prayer, O Moses!"

<span id="page_796">p. 796</span>

37\. "And indeed We conferred  
A favour on thee  
Another time (before).

38\. "Behold! We sent  
To thy mother, by inspiration,  
The message:

39\. "Throw (the child)  
Into the chest, and throw  
(The chest) into the river:  
The river will cast him  
Up on the bank, and he  
Will be taken up by one  
Who is an enemy to Me  
And an enemy to him  
But I cast (the garment  
Of) love over thee from Me  
And (this) in order that  
Thou mayest be reared  
Under Mine eye.

40\. "Behold! thy sister goeth forth  
And saith, "Shall I show you

<span id="page_797">p. 797</span>

One who will nurse  
And rear the (child)?  
So We brought thee back  
To thy mother, that her eye  
Might be cooled and she  
Should not grieve.  
Then thou didst slay  
A man, but We saved thee  
From trouble, and We tried  
Thee in various ways.  
Then didst thou tarry  
A number of years  
With the people of Midian.  
Then didst thou come hither  
As ordained, O Moses!

41\. "And I have prepared thee  
For Myself (for service)"…

42\. "Go, thou and thy brother,  
With My Signs,

<span id="page_798">p. 798</span>

And slacken not,  
Either of you, in keeping  
Me in remembrance.

43\. "Go, both of you, to Pharaoh,  
For he has indeed  
Transgressed all bounds;

44\. "But speak to him mildly;  
Perchance he may take  
Warning or fear (God)."

45\. They (Moses and Aaron) said:  
"Our Lord! We fear lest  
He hasten with insolence  
Against us, or lest he  
Transgress all bounds."

46\. He said: "Fear not:  
For I am with you:  
I hear and see (everything).

47\. "So go ye both to him,  
And say, "Verily we are  
Apostles sent by thy Lord:  
Send forth, therefore, the Children  
Of Israel with us, and  
Afflict them not:  
With a Sign, indeed,  
Have we come from thy Lord!

<span id="page_799">p. 799</span>

And Peace to all  
Who follow guidance!

48\. "Verily it has been revealed  
To us that the Penalty  
(Awaits) those who reject  
And turn away."

49\. (When this message was delivered),  
(Pharaoh) said: "Who, then,  
O Moses, is the Lord  
Of you two?"

50\. He said: "Our Lord is  
He Who gave to each  
(Created) thing its form  
And nature, and further,  
Gave (it) guidance."

51\. (Pharaoh) said: "What then  
Is the condition  
Of previous generations?"

<span id="page_800">p. 800</span>

52\. He replied: "The knowledge  
Of that is with my Lord,  
Duly recorded: my Lord  
Never errs, nor forgets,—

53\. "He Who has made for you  
The earth like a carpet  
Spread out; has enabled you  
To go about therein by roads  
(And channels); and has sent  
Down water from the sky."  
With it have We produced  
Divers pairs of plants  
Each separate front the others.

54\. Eat (for yourselves) and pasture  
Your cattle: verily, in this  
Are Signs for men  
Endued with understanding.

##### SECTION 3.

55\. From the (earth) did We  
Create you, and into it  
Shall We return you,  
And from it shall We  
Bring you out once again"

56\. And We showed Pharaoh  
All Our Signs, but he  
Did reject and refuse.

<span id="page_80l">p. 80l</span>

57\. He said: "Hast thou come  
To drive us out  
Of our land with thy magic,  
O Moses?

58\. "But we can surely produce  
Magic to match thine!  
So make a tryst  
Between us and thee,  
Which we shall not fail  
To keep—neither we nor thou—  
In a place where both  
Shall have even chances."

59\. Moses said: "Your tryst  
Is the Day of the Festival,  
And let the people be assembled  
When the sun is well up."

60\. So Pharaoh withdrew:  
He concerted his plan,  
And then came (back).

61\. Moses said to him:  
Woe to you! Forge not  
Ye a lie against God,  
Lest He destroy you (at once)

<span id="page_802">p. 802</span>

Utterly by chastisement:  
The forger must suffer  
Frustration!"

62\. So they disputed, one with  
Another, over their affair,  
But they kept their talk secret.

63\. They said: "These two  
Are certainly (expert) magicians:  
Their object is to drive you  
Out from your land  
With their magic, and  
To do away with your  
Most cherished institutions.

64\. "Therefore concert your plan,  
And then assemble  
In (serried) ranks:  
He wins (all along) to-day  
Who gains the upper hand"

65\. They said: "O Moses!  
Whether wilt thou  
That thou throw (first)  
Or that we be the first  
To throw?"

66\. He said, "Nay, throw ye  
First!" Then behold

<span id="page_803">p. 803</span>

Their ropes and their rods—  
So it seemed to him  
On account of their magic—  
Began to be in lively motion!

67\. So Moses conceived  
In his mind  
A (sort of) fear.

68\. We said: "Fear not!  
For thou hast indeed  
The upper hand:

69\. "Throw that which is  
In thy right hand:  
Quickly will it swallow up  
That which they have faked  
What they have faked  
Is but a magician's trick:  
And the magician thrives not,  
(No matter) where he goes."

70\. So the magicians were  
Thrown down to prostration:  
They said, "We believe  
In the Lord of Aaron and Moses".

71\. (Pharaoh) said: "Believe ye  
In Him before I give  
You permission? Surely  
This must be your leader,  
Who has taught you magic!  
Be sure I will cut off

<span id="page_804">p. 804</span>

Your hands and feet  
On opposite sides, and I  
Will have you crucified  
On trunks of palm-trees:  
So shall ye know for certain,  
Which of us can give  
The more severe and the more  
Lasting Punishment!"

72\. They said: "Never shall we  
Regard thee as more than  
The Clear Signs that have  
Come to us; or than  
Him Who created us!  
So decree whatever thou  
Desirest to decree: for thou  
Canst only decree (touching)  
The life of this world.

73\. "For us, we have believed  
In our Lord: may He  
Forgive us our faults,  
And the magic to which  
Thou didst compel us:  
For God is Best  
And Most Abiding."

74\. Verily he who comes  
To his Lord as a sinner  
(At Judgment),—for him  
Is Hell: therein shall he  
Neither die nor live.

<span id="page_805">p. 805</span>

75\. But such as come  
To Him as Believers  
Who have worked righteous deeds,—  
For them are ranks exalted,—

76\. Gardens of Eternity,  
Beneath which flow rivers:  
They will dwell therein  
For aye: such is the reward  
Of those who purify  
Themselves (from evil).

##### SECTION 4.

77\. We sent an inspiration  
To Moses: "Travel by night  
With My servants, and strike  
A dry path for them  
Through the sea, without fear  
Of being overtaken (by Pharaoh)  
And without (any other) fear."

78\. Then Pharaoh pursued them  
With his forces, but  
The waters completely overwhelmed  
Them and covered them up.

79\. Pharaoh led his people astray  
Instead of leading them aright.

<span id="page_806">p. 806</span>

80\. O ye Children of Israel!  
We delivered you from  
Your enemy, and We  
Made a Covenant with you  
On the right side of  
Mount (Sinai), and We sent  
Down to you Manna  
And quails:

81\. (Saying): "Eat of the good  
Things We have provided  
For your sustenance, but  
Commit no excess therein,  
Lest My Wrath should justly  
Descend on you: and those  
On whom descends My Wrath  
Do perish indeed!

82\. "But, without doubt, I am  
(Also) He that forgives  
Again and again, to those  
Who repent, believe,  
And do right,—who,  
In fine, are ready to receive  
True guidance."

83\. (When Moses was up on the Mount,  
God said:) "What made thee  
Hasten in advance of thy people,  
O Moses?"

84\. He replied: "Behold, they are  
Close on my footsteps:

<span id="page_807">p. 807</span>

I hastened to Thee.  
O my Lord,  
To please Thee."

85\. (God) said: "We have tested  
Thy people in thy absence:  
The Sāmirī has led them  
Astray."

86\. So Moses returned to his people  
In a state of indignation  
And sorrow. He said:  
"O my people! did not  
Your Lord make a handsome  
Promise to you? Did then  
The promise seem to you  
Long (in coming)? Or did ye  
Desire that Wrath should  
Descend from your Lord on you,  
And so ye broke your promise  
To me?"

87\. They said: "We broke not  
The promise to thee, as far  
As lay in our power:  
But we were made to carry  
The weight of the ornaments  
Of the (whole) people, and we

<span id="page_808">p. 808</span>

Threw them (into the fire),  
And that was what  
The Sāmirī suggested.

88\. "Then he brought out  
(Of the fire) before the (people)  
The image of a calf:  
It seemed to low:  
So they said, "This is  
Your god, and the god  
Of Moses, but (Moses)  
Has forgotten!"

89\. Could they not see that  
It could not return them  
A word (for answer), and that  
It had no power either  
To harm them or  
To do them good?

##### SECTION 5.

90\. Aaron had already, before this  
Said to them: ."O my people!  
Ye are being tested in this:  
For verily your Lord is (God)  
Most Gracious: so follow me  
And obey my command."

<span id="page_809">p. 809</span>

91\. They had said: "We will not  
Abandon this cult, but we  
Will devote ourselves to it  
Until Moses returns to us.

92\. (Moses) said: "O Aaron!  
What kept thee back, when  
Thou sawest them going wrong,

93\. "From following me? Didst thou  
Then disobey my order?"

94\. (Aaron) replied: "O son  
Of my mother! Seize (me) not  
By my beard nor by  
(The hair of) my head!  
Truly I feared lest thou  
Shouldst say, "Thou hast caused  
A division among the Children  
Of Israel, and thou didst not  
Respect my word!"

95\. (Moses) said: "What then  
Is thy case, O Sāmarī?"

96\. He replied: "I saw what  
They saw not: so I took

<span id="page_810">p. 810</span>

A handful (of dust) from  
The footprint of the Apostle,  
And threw it (into the calf):  
Thus did my soul suggest  
To me."

97\. (Moses) said: "Get thee gone!  
But thy (punishment) in this life  
Will be that thou wilt say,  
'Touch me not'; and moreover  
(For a future penalty) thou hast  
A promise that will not fail:  
Now look at thy god,  
Of whom thou hast become  
A devoted worshipper:  
We will certainly (melt) it  
In a blazing fire and scatter  
It broadcast in the sea!"

<span id="page_811">p. 811</span>

98\. But the God of you all  
Is the One God: there is  
No god but He: all things  
He comprehends in His knowledge.

99\. Thus do We relate to thee  
Some stories of what happened  
Before: for We have sent  
Thee a Message from  
Our own Presence,

100\. If any do turn away  
Therefrom, verily they will  
Bear a burden  
On the Day of Judgment;

101\. They will abide in this (state):  
And grievous will the burden  
Be to them on that Day,—

102\. The Day when the Trumpet  
Will be sounded: that Day,  
We shall gather the sinful,  
Blear-eyed (with terror).

103\. In whispers will they consult  
Each other: "Ye tarried not  
Longer than ten (Days);"

104\. We know best what they  
Will say, when their leader

<span id="page_812">p. 812</span>

Most eminent in Conduct  
Will say: "Ye tarried not  
Longer than a day!"

##### SECTION 6.

105\. They ask thee concerning  
The Mountains: say, "My Lord  
Will uproot them and scatter  
Them as dust;

106\. "He will leave them as plains  
Smooth and level;

107\. "Nothing crooked or curved  
Wilt thou see in their place."

108\. On that Day will they follow  
The Caller (straight): no crookedness

<span id="page_813">p. 813</span>

(Can they show) him: all sounds  
Shall humble themselves in  
The Presence of (God) Most Gracious:  
Nothing shalt thou hear  
But the tramp of their feet  
(As they march).

109\. On that Day shall no  
Intercession avail  
Except for those for whom  
Permission has been granted  
By (God) Most Gracious  
And whose word is  
Acceptable to Him.

110\. He knows what (appears  
To His creatures as) before  
Or after or behind them:  
But they shall not compass it  
With their knowledge.

111\. (All) faces shall be humbled  
Before (Him)—the Living,  
The Self-Subsisting, Eternal:  
Hopeless indeed will be  
The man that carries  
Iniquity (on his back).

<span id="page_814">p. 814</span>

112\. But he who works deeds  
Of righteousness, and has faith,  
Will have no fear of harm  
Nor of any curtailment  
(Of what is his due).

113\. Thus have We sent this  
Down—an Arabic Qur-ān—  
And explained therein in detail  
Some of the warnings,  
In order that they may  
Fear God, or that it may  
Cause their remembrance (of Him).

114\. High above all is God,  
The King, the Truth!  
Be not in haste  
With the Qur-ān before  
Its revelation to thee  
Is completed, but say,  
"O my Lord! advance me  
In knowledge."

115\. We had already, beforehand,  
Taken the covenant of Adam,

<span id="page_815">p. 815</span>

But he forgot: and We found  
On his part no firm resolve.

##### SECTION 7.

116\. When We said to the angels,  
"Prostrate yourselves to Adam",  
They prostrated themselves, but not  
Iblīs: he refused.

117\. Then We said: "O Adam!  
Verily, this is an enemy  
To thee and thy wife:  
So let him not get you  
Both out of the Garden,  
So that thou art landed  
In misery.''

118\. "There is therein (enough provision)  
For thee not to go hungry  
Nor to go naked,

119\. "Nor to suffer from thirst,  
Nor from the sun's heat."

120\. But Satan whispered evil  
To him: he said, "O Adam!  
Shall I lead thee to  
The Tree of Eternity  
And to a kingdom  
That never decays?"

<span id="page_816">p. 816</span>

121\. In the result, they both  
Ate of the tree, and so  
Their nakedness appeared  
To them: they began to sew  
Together, for their covering,  
Leaves from the Garden:  
Thus did Adam disobey  
His Lord, and allow himself  
To be seduced.

122\. But his Lord chose him  
(For His Grace): He turned  
To him, and gave him guidance.

123\. He said: "Get ye down,  
Both of you,—all together,  
From the Garden, with enmity  
One to another: but if,  
As is sure, there comes to you  
Guidance from Me, whosoever  
Follows My guidance, will not  
Lose his way, nor fall  
Into misery.

124\. "But whosoever turns away  
From My Message, verily  
For him is a life narrowed  
Down, and We shall raise

<span id="page_817">p. 817</span>

Him up blind on the Day  
Of Judgment."

125\. He will say: "O my Lord!  
Why hast thou raised me  
Up blind, while I had  
Sight (before)?"

126\. (God) will say: "Thus  
Didst thou, when Our Signs  
Came unto thee, disregard  
Them: so wilt thou,  
This day, be disregarded."

127\. And thus do We recompense  
Him who transgresses beyond bounds  
And believes not in the Signs  
Of his Lord: and the Penalty  
Of the Hereafter is far more  
Grievous and more enduring.

128\. Is it not a warning to such  
Men (to call to mind)  
How many generations before them  
We destroyed, in whose haunts  
They (now) move? Verily,  
In this are Signs for men  
Endued with understanding.

<span id="page_818">p. 818</span>

##### SECTION 8.

129\. Had it not been  
For a Word that went forth  
Before from thy Lord,  
(Their punishment) must necessarily  
Have come; but there is  
A term appointed (for respite).

130\. Therefore be patient with what  
They say, and celebrate (constantly)  
The praises of thy Lord,  
Before the rising of the sun,  
And before its setting;  
Yea, celebrate them  
For part of the hours  
Of the night, and at the sides  
Of the day: that thou  
Mayest have (spiritual) joy.

131\. Nor strain thine eyes in longing  
For the things We have given  
For enjoyment to parties ,  
Of them, the splendour

<span id="page_819">p. 819</span>

Of the life of this world,  
Through which We test them:  
But the provision of thy Lord  
Is better and more enduring.

132\. Enjoin prayer on thy people,  
And be constant therein.  
We ask thee not to provide  
Sustenance: We provide it  
For thee. But the (fruit of)  
The Hereafter is for Righteousness.

133\. ''They say: "Why does he not  
Bring us a Sign from  
His Lord?" Has not  
A Clear Sign come to them  
Of all that was  
In the former Books  
Of revelation?

134\. And if We had inflicted  
On them a penalty before this,  
They would have said:  
"Our Lord! If only Thou  
Hadst sent us an apostle,  
We should certainly have followed

<span id="page_820">p. 820</span>

Thy Signs before we were  
Humbled and put to shame."

135\. Say: "Each one (of us)  
Is waiting: wait ye, therefore,  
And soon shall ye know  
Who it is that is  
On the straight and even  
Way, and who it is  
That has received guidance."
