### Sūra XCVI.

### *Iqraa*, or Read! or Proclaim!

###### Or *’Alaq*, or The Clot of Congealed Blood.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Proclaim! (or Read!)  
In the name  
Of thy Lord and Cherisher,  
Who created—

2\. Created man, out of  
A (mere) clot  
Of congealed blood:

3\. Proclaim! And thy Lord  
Is Most Bountiful,—

4\. He Who taught  
(The use of) the Pen,—

<span id="page_1762">p. 1762</span>

5\. Taught man that  
Which he knew not.

6\. Nay, but man doth  
Transgress all bounds,

7\. In that he looketh  
Upon himself as self-sufficient.

8\. Verily, to thy Lord  
Is the return (of all).

9\. Seest thou one  
Who forbids—

10\. A votary when he  
(Turns) to pray?

11\. Seest thou if  
He is on (the road  
Of) Guidance?—

12\. Or enjoins Righteousness?

<span id="page_1763">p. 1763</span>

13\. Seest thou if he  
Denies (Truth) and turns away?

14\. Knoweth he not  
That God doth see?

15\. Let him beware! If he  
Desist not, We will  
Drag him by the forelock,—

16\. A lying, sinful forelock!

17\. Then, let him call  
(For help) to his council  
(Of comrades):

18\. We will call  
On the angels of punishment  
(To deal with him)!

19\. Nay, heed him not:  
But bow down in adoration,  
And bring thyself  
The closer (to God)!
