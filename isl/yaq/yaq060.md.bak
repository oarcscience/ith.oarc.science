### Sūra LX.

### *Mumtaḥana,* or the Woman to be Examined.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most, Merciful.*

1\. O ye who believe!  
Take not My enemies  
And yours as friends  
(Or protectors),—offering them  
(Your) love, even though  
They have rejected the Truth  
That has come to you,  
And have (on the contrary)  
Driven out the Prophet  
And yourselves (from your homes),  
(Simply) because ye believe  
In God your Lord!  
If ye have come out  
To strive in My Way  
And to seek My Good Pleasure,  
(Take them not as friends),  
Holding secret converse  
Of love (and friendship)  
With them: for I know  
Full well all that ye  
Conceal and all that ye  
Reveal. And any of you  
That does this has strayed  
From the Straight Path.

2\. If they were to get  
The better of you,

<span id="page_1532">p. 1532</span>

They would behave to you  
As enemies, and stretch forth  
Their hands and their tongues  
Against you for evil;  
And they desire that ye  
Should reject the Truth.

3\. Of no profit to you  
Will be your relatives  
And your children  
On the Day of Judgment:  
He will judge between you:  
For God sees well  
All that ye do.

4\. There is for you  
An excellent example (to follow)  
In Abraham and those with him,  
When they said  
To their people:  
"We are clear of you  
And of whatever ye worship  
Besides God: we have rejected  
You, and there has arisen,  
Between us and you, enmity  
And hatred for ever,—unless  
Ye believe in God  
And Him alone":  
But not when Abraham  
Said to his father:  
"I will pray for forgiveness

<span id="page_1533">p. 1533</span>

For thee, though I have  
No power (to get) aught  
On thy behalf from God."  
(They prayed): "Our Lord!  
In Thee do we trust,  
And to Thee do we turn  
In repentance: to Thee  
Is (our) final Goal.

5\. "Our Lord! Make us not  
A (test and) trial  
For the Unbelievers,  
But forgive us, our Lord!  
For Thou art the Exalted  
In Might, the Wise."

6\. There was indeed in them  
An excellent example for you  
To follow,—for those  
Whose hope is in God  
And in the Last Day.  
But if any turn away,  
Truly God is Free of all  
Wants, Worthy of all Praise.

##### SECTION 2.

7\. It may be that God  
Will grant love (and friendship)  
Between you and those whom  
Ye (now) hold as enemies.  
For God has power  
(Over all things); And God is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

<span id="page_1534">p. 1534</span>

8\. God forbids you not,  
With regard to those who  
Fight you not for (your) Faith  
Nor drive you out  
Of your homes,  
From dealing kindly and justly  
With them: For God loveth  
Those who are just.

9\. God only forbids you,  
With regard to those who  
Fight you for (your) Faith,  
And drive you out  
Of your homes, and support  
(Others) in driving you out,  
From turning to them  
(For friendship and protection).  
It is such as turn to them  
(In these circumstances),  
That do wrong.

10\. O ye who believe!  
When there come to you  
Believing women refugees,  
Examine (and test) them:  
God knows best as to  
Their Faith: if ye ascertain  
That they are Believers,  
Then send them not back  
To the Unbelievers.  
They are not lawful (wives)

<span id="page_1535">p. 1535</span>

For the Unbelievers, nor are  
The (Unbelievers) lawful (husbands)  
For them. But pay  
The Unbelievers what they  
Have spent (on their dower).  
And there will be no blame  
On you if ye marry them  
On payment of their dower  
To them. But hold not  
To the guardianship of  
Unbelieving women: ask  
For what ye have spent  
On their dowers, and let  
The (Unbelievers) ask for  
What they have spent  
(On the dowers of women  
Who come over to you).  
Such is the command  
Of God: He judges  
(With justice) between you.  
And God is Full of  
Knowledge and Wisdom.

11\. And if any  
Of your wives deserts you  
To the Unbelievers,  
And ye have an accession  
(By the coming over of  
A woman from the other side),  
Then pay to those  
Whose wives have deserted

<span id="page_1536">p. 1536</span>

The equivalent of what they  
Had spent (on their dower).  
And fear God,  
In Whom ye believe.

12\. O Prophet!  
When believing women come  
To thee to take the oath  
Of fealty to thee, that they  
Will not associate in worship  
Any other thing whatever  
With God, that they  
Will not steal, that they  
Will not commit adultery  
(Or fornication), that they  
Will not kill their children,  
That they will not utter  
Slander, intentionally forging  
Falsehood, and that they  
Will not disobey thee  
In any just matter,  
Then do thou receive  
Their fealty, and pray to God  
For the forgiveness (of  
Their sins): for God is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

13\. O ye who believe!  
Turn not (for friendship)  
To people on whom  
Is the Wrath of God.

<span id="page_1537">p. 1537</span>

Of the Hereafter they are  
Already in despair, just as  
The Unbelievers are  
In despair about those  
(Buried) in graves.
