### Sūra XXIII.

### Mu-minūn, or The Believers.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. The Believers must  
(Eventually) win through,—

2\. Those who humble themselves  
In their prayers;

3\. Who avoid vain talk;

4\. Who are active in deeds  
Of charity;

5\. Who abstain from sex,

6\. Except with those joined  
To them in the marriage bond,  
Or (the captives) whom  
Their right hands possess,—  
For (in their case) they are  
Free from blame,

7\. But those whose desires exceed  
Those limits are transgressors;—

<span id="page_875">p. 875</span>

8\. Those who faithfully observe  
Their trusts and their covenants;

9\. And who (strictly) guard  
Their prayers;—

10\. These will be the heirs,

11\. Who will inherit Paradise:  
They will dwell therein  
(For ever).

12\. Man We did create  
From a quintessence (of clay);

13\. Then We placed him  
As (a drop of) sperm

<span id="page_876">p. 876</span>

In a place of rest,  
Firmly fixed;

14\. Then We made the sperm  
Into a clot of congealed blood;  
Then of that clot We made  
A (fœtus) lump; then We  
Made out of that lump  
Bones and clothed the bones  
With flesh; then We developed  
Out of it another creature.  
So blessed be God,  
The Best to create!

15\. After that, at length  
Ye will die.

16\. Again, on the Day  
Of Judgment, will ye be  
Raised up.

17\. And We have made, above you,  
Seven tracts; and We  
Are never unmindful  
Of (Our) Creation,

<span id="page_877">p. 877</span>

18\. And We send down water  
From the sky according to  
(Due) measure, and We cause it  
To soak in the soil;  
And We certainly are able  
To drain it off (with ease).

19\. With it We grow for you  
Gardens of date-palms  
And vines: in them have ye  
Abundant fruits: and of them  
Ye eat (and have enjoyment),—

20\. Also a tree springing  
Out of Mount Sinai,  
Which produces oil,  
And relish for those  
Who use it for food.

21\. And in cattle (too) ye  
Have an instructive example:  
From within their bodies  
We produce (milk) for you

<span id="page_878">p. 878</span>

To drink; there art, in them,  
(Besides), numerous (other)  
Benefits for you;  
And of their (meat) ye eat;

22\. And on them, as well as  
In ships, ye ride.

##### SECTION 2.

23\. (Further, We sent a long line  
Of prophets for your instruction).  
We sent Noah to his people:  
He said, "O my people!  
Worship God! Ye have  
No other god but Him.  
Will ye not fear (Him)?"

24\. The chiefs of the Unbelievers  
Among his people said:  
"He is no more than a man  
Like yourselves: his wish is  
To assert his superiority  
Over you: if God had wished  
(To send messengers),  
He could have sent down  
Angels: never did we hear  
Such a thing (as he says),  
Among our ancestors of old."

25\. (And some said): "He is  
Only a man possessed:  
Wait (and have patience)  
With him for a time."

<span id="page_879">p. 879</span>

26\. (Noah) said: "O my Lord!  
Help me: for that they  
Accuse me of falsehood!"

27\. So We inspired him  
(With this message): "Construct  
The Ark within Our sight  
And under Our guidance: then  
When comes Our command,  
And the fountains of the earth  
Gush forth, take thou on board  
Pairs of every species, male  
And female, and thy family—  
Except those of them  
Against whom the Word  
Has already gone forth:  
And address Me not  
In favour of the wrong-doers;  
For they shall be drowned  
(In the Flood).

28\. And when thou hast embarked  
On the Ark—thou and those  
With thee,—say: "Praise be  
To God, Who has saved us  
From the people who do wrong."

29\. And say: "O my Lord!  
Enable me to disembark  
With Thy blessing: for Thou  
Art the Best to enable (us)  
To disembark."

30\. Verily in this there are  
Signs (for men to understand);  
(Thus) do We try (men)."

<span id="page_880">p. 880</span>

31\. Then We raised after them  
Another generation.

32\. And We sent to them  
An apostle from among themselves,  
(Saying), "Worship God!  
Ye have no other god  
But Him. Will ye not  
Fear (Him)?"

##### SECTION 3.

33\. And the chiefs  
Of his people, who disbelieved  
And denied the Meeting  
In the Hereafter, and on whom  
We had bestowed the good things  
Of this life, said: "He is  
No more than a man  
Like yourselves: he eats  
Of that of which ye eat,  
And drinks of what ye drink.

34\. "If ye obey a man  
Like yourselves, behold,  
It is certain ye will be lost.

35\. "Does he promise that  
When ye die and become dust  
And bones, ye shall be  
Brought forth (again)?

36\. "Far, very far is that  
Which ye are promised!

<span id="page_881">p. 881</span>

37\. "There is nothing but  
Our life in this world!  
We shall die and we live!  
But we shall never  
Be raised up again!

38\. "He is only a man  
Who invents a lie  
Against God, but we  
Are not the ones  
To believe in him!"

39\. (The prophet) said:  
"O my Lord! help me:  
For that they accuse me  
Of falsehood."

40\. (God) said: "In but  
A little while, they  
Are sure to be sorry!"

41\. Then the Blast overtook them  
With justice, and We made them  
As rubbish of dead leaves  
(Floating on the stream of Time)!  
So away with the people  
Who do wrong!

42\. Then We raised after them  
Other generations.

43\. No people can hasten  
Their term, nor can they  
Delay (it).

<span id="page_882">p. 882</span>

44\. Then sent We Our apostles  
In succession: every time  
There came to a people  
Their apostle, they accused him  
Of falsehood: so We made  
Them follow each other  
(In punishment): We made them  
As a tale (that is told):  
So away with a people  
That will not believe!

45\. When We sent Moses  
And his brother Aaron,  
With Our Signs and  
Authority manifest,

46\. To Pharaoh and his Chiefs:  
But these behaved insolently:  
They were an arrogant people.

47\. They said: "Shall we believe  
In two men like ourselves?  
And their people are subject  
To us!"

48\. So they accused them  
Of falsehood, and they became  
Of those who were destroyed.

49\. And We gave Moses  
The Book, in order that  
They might receive guidance.

<span id="page_883">p. 883</span>

50\. And We made  
The son of Mary  
And his mother  
As a Sign:  
We gave them both  
Shelter on high ground,  
Affording rest and security  
And furnished with springs.

##### SECTION 4.

51\. O ye apostles! enjoy  
(All) things good and pure,  
And work righteousness:  
For I am well-acquainted  
With (all) that ye do.

52\. And verily this Brotherhood  
Of yours is a single Brotherhood,  
And I am your Lord  
And Cherisher: therefore  
Fear Me (and no other).

<span id="page_884">p. 884</span>

53\. But people have cut off  
Their affair (of unity),  
Between them, into sects:  
Each party rejoices in that  
Which is with itself.

54\. But leave them  
In their confused ignorance  
For a time.

55\. Do they think that because  
We have granted them abundance  
Of wealth and sons,

56\. We would hasten them  
On in every good? Nay,  
They do not understand.

57\. Verily those who live  
In awe for fear of their Lord;

58\. Those who believe  
In the Signs of their Lord;

59\. Those who join not (in worship)  
Partners with their Lord;

60\. And those who dispense  
Their charity with their hearts  
Full of fear, because  
They will return to their Lord;—

61\. It is these who hasten  
In every good work,  
And these who are  
Foremost in them.

<span id="page_885">p. 885</span>

62\. On no soul do We  
Place a burden greater  
Than it can bear:  
Before Us is a record  
Which clearly shows the truth:  
They will never be wronged.

63\. But their hearts are  
In confused ignorance  
Of this; and there are,  
Besides that, deeds of theirs,  
Which they will (continue)  
To do,—

64\. Until, when We seize  
In Punishment those of them  
Who received the good things  
Of this world, behold,  
They will groan in supplication!

65\. (It will be said):  
"Groan not in supplication  
This day; for ye shall  
Certainly not be helped by Us.

66\. "My Signs used to be  
Rehearsed to you, but ye  
Used to turn back  
On your heels—

67\. "In arrogance: talking nonsense  
About the (Qur-ān), like one  
Telling fables by night."

<span id="page_886">p. 886</span>

68\. Do they not ponder over  
The Word (of God), or  
Has anything (new) come  
To them that did not  
Come to their fathers of old?

69\. Or do they not recognise  
Their Apostle, that they  
Deny him?

70\. Or do they say, "he is  
Possessed"? Nay, he has  
Brought them the Truth,  
But most of them  
Hate the Truth.

71\. If the Truth had been  
In accord with their desires,  
Truly the heavens and the earth,  
And all beings therein  
Would have been in confusion  
And corruption! Nay, We  
Have sent them their admonition,  
But they turn away  
From their admonition.

72\. Or is it that thou  
Askest them for some  
Recompense? But the recompense  
Of thy Lord is best:  
He is the Best of those  
Who give sustenance.

73\. But verily thou callest them  
To the Straight Way;

<span id="page_887">p. 887</span>

74\. And verily those who  
Believe not in the Hereafter  
Are deviating from that Way.

75\. If We had mercy on them  
And removed the distress  
Which is on them, they  
Would obstinately persist  
In their transgression,  
Wandering in distraction  
To and fro.

76\. We inflicted Punishment  
On them, but they  
Humbled not themselves  
To their Lord, nor do they  
Submissively entreat (Him)!—

77\. Until We open on them  
A gate leading to  
A severe Punishment: then  
Lo! they will be plunged  
In despair therein!

##### SECTION 5.

78\. It is He Who has created  
For you (the faculties of)  
Hearing, sight, feeling  
And understanding: little thanks  
It is ye give!

<span id="page_888">p. 888</span>

79\. And He Has multiplied you  
Through the earth, and to Him  
Shall ye be gathered back.

80\. It is He Who gives  
Life and death, and to Him  
(Is due) the alternation  
Of Night and Day:  
Will ye not then understand?

81\. On the contrary they say  
Things similar to what  
The ancients said.

82\. They say: "What! When we  
Die and become dust and bones,  
Could we really be  
Raised up again?

83\. "Such things have been promised  
To us and to our fathers  
Before! They are nothing  
But tales of the ancients!"

84\. Say: "To whom belong  
The earth and all beings therein?  
(Say) if ye know!"

85\. They will say, "To God!"  
Say: "Yet will ye not  
Receive admonition?"

86\. Say: "Who is the Lord  
Of the seven heavens,  
And the Lord of the Throne  
(Of Glory) Supreme?"

<span id="page_889">p. 889</span>

87\. They will say, "(They belong)  
To God." Say: "Will ye not  
Then be filled with awe?"

88\. Say: "Who is it in whose  
Hands is the governance  
Of all things,—who protects  
(All), but is not protected  
(Of any)? (Say) if ye know."

89\. They will say, "(It belongs)  
To God." Say: "Then how  
Are ye deluded?"

90\. We have sent them the Truth:  
But they indeed practise Falsehood!

91\. No son did God beget,  
Nor is there any god  
Along with Him: (if there were  
Many gods), behold, each god  
Would have taken away  
What he had created,  
And some would have  
Lorded it over others!  
Glory to God! (He is free)  
From the (sort of) things  
They attribute to Him!

92\. He knows what is hidden  
And what is open: too high  
Is He for the partners  
They attribute to Him!

<span id="page_890">p. 890</span>

##### SECTION 6.

93\. Say: "O my Lord!  
If Thou wilt show me  
(In my lifetime) that which  
They are warned against,—

94\. "Then, O my Lord! put me not  
Amongst the people  
Who do wrong!"

95\. And We are certainly able  
To show thee (in fulfilment)  
That against which they are warned.

96\. Repel evil with that'  
Which is best: We are  
Well acquainted with  
The things they say.

97\. And say "O my Lord!  
I seek refuge with Thee

<span id="page_891">p. 891</span>

From the suggestions  
Of the Evil Ones.

98\. "And I seek refuge with Thee  
O my Lord! lest they  
Should come near me."

99\. (In Falsehood will they be)  
Until, when death comes  
To one of them, he says:  
"O my Lord! send me back  
(To life),—

100\. "In order that I may  
Work righteousness in the things  
I neglected."—"By no means!  
It is but a word he says."—  
Before them is a Partition  
Till the Day they are  
Raised up.

101\. When the Trumpet  
Is blown, there will be  
No more relationships  
Between them that day,  
Nor will one ask after another!

<span id="page_892">p. 892</span>

102\. Then those whose balance  
(Of good deeds) is heavy,—  
They will attain salvation:

103\. But those whose balance  
Is light, will be those  
Who have lost their souls;  
In Hell will they abide.

104\. The Fire will burn their faces,  
And they will therein  
Grin, with their lips displaced.

105\. "Were not My Signs rehearsed  
To you, and ye did but  
Treat them as falsehoods?"

106\. They will say: "Our Lord!  
Our misfortune overwhelmed us,  
And we became a people  
Astray!

107\. "Our Lord! Bring us out  
Of this: if ever we return  
(To evil), then shall we be  
Wrong-doers indeed!"

108\. He will say: "Be ye  
Driven into it (with ignominy)!  
And speak ye not to Me!

109\. "A part of My servants  
There was, who used to pray,

<span id="page_893">p. 893</span>

'Our Lord! we believe;  
Then do Thou forgive us,  
And have mercy upon us:  
For Thou art the Best  
Of those who show mercy!'

110\. "But ye treated them  
With ridicule, so much so  
That (ridicule of) them made you  
Forget My Message while  
Ye were laughing at them!

111\. "I have rewarded them  
This day for their patience  
And constancy: they are indeed  
The ones that have achieved Bliss:.."

112\. He will say: "What number  
Of years did ye stay  
On earth?"

113\. They will say: "We stayed  
A day or part of a day:  
But ask those who  
Keep account."

114\. He will say: "Ye stayed  
Not but a little,—  
If ye had only known!

115\. "Did ye then think  
That We had created you

<span id="page_894">p. 894</span>

In jest, and that ye  
Would not be brought back  
To Us (for account)?"

116\. Therefore exalted be God,  
The King, the Reality:  
There is no god but He,  
The Lord of the Throne  
Of Honour!

117\. If anyone invokes, besides God,  
Any other god, he has  
No authority therefor;  
And his reckoning will be  
Only with his Lord!  
And verily the Unbelievers  
Will fail to win through

118\. So say: "O my Lord!  
Grant Thou forgiveness and mercy!  
For Thou art the Best  
Of those who show mercy!"
