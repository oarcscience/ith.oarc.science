### Sūra LXIX.

### *Ḥāqqa,* or the Sure Reality.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. The Sure Reality!

2\. What is the Sure Reality?

3\. And what will make  
Thee realise what  
The Sure Reality is?

4\. The <u>Th</u>amūd  
And the ‘Ād people  
(Branded) as false  
The Stunning Calamity!

5\. But the <u>Th</u>amūd,—  
They were destroyed  
By a terrible Storm  
Of thunder and lightning!

6\. And the ‘Ād,—  
They were destroyed  
By a furious Wind,  
Exceedingly violent;

<span id="page_1597">p. 1597</span>

7\. He made it rage  
Against them seven nights  
And eight days in succession:  
So that thou couldst see  
The (whole) people lying  
Prostrate in its (path),  
As if they had been  
Roots of hollow palm-trees  
Tumbled down!

8\. Then seest thou any  
Of them left surviving?

9\. And Pharaoh,  
And those before him,  
And the Cities Overthrown,  
Committed habitual Sin,

10\. And disobeyed (each)  
The apostle of their Lord;  
So He punished them  
With an abundant Penalty.

11\. We, when the water  
(Of Noah's Flood) overflowed  
Beyond its limits,  
Carried you (mankind),  
In the floating (Ark),

<span id="page_1598">p. 1598</span>

12\. That We might  
Make it a Message  
Unto you, and that ears  
(That should hear the tale  
And) retain its memory  
Should bear its (lessons)  
In remembrance.

13\. Then, when one  
Blast is sounded  
On the Trumpet,

14\. And the earth is moved,  
And its mountains,  
And they are crushed to powder  
At one stroke,—

15\. On that Day  
Shall the (Great) Event  
Come to pass,

16\. And the sky will be  
Rent asunder, for it will  
That Day be flimsy,

17\. And the angels will be  
On its sides,

<span id="page_1599">p. 1599</span>

And eight will, that Day,  
Bear the Throne  
Of thy Lord above them.

18\. That Day shall ye be  
Brought to Judgment:  
Not an act of yours  
That ye hide will be hidden.

19\. Then he that will be  
Given his Record  
In his right hand  
Will say: "Ah here!  
Read ye my Record!

20\. "I did really understand  
That my Account would  
(One Day) reach me!"

21\. And he will be  
In a life of Bliss,

22\. In a Garden on high,

23\. The Fruits whereof  
(Will hang in bunches)  
Low and near.

24\. "Eat ye and drink ye,  
With full satisfaction;

<span id="page_1600">p. 1600</span>

Because of the (good)  
That ye sent before you,  
In the days that are gone!"

25\. And he that will  
Be given his Record  
In his left hand,  
Will say: "Ah! would  
That my record had not  
Been given to me!

26\. "And that I had never  
Realised how  
My account (stood)!

27\. "Ah! would that (Death)  
Had made an end of me!

28\. "Of no profit to me  
Has been my wealth!

29\. "My power has  
Perished from me!"…

30\. (The stern command will say):  
"Seize ye him,  
And bind ye him,

<span id="page_1601">p. 1601</span>

31\. "And burn ye him  
In the Blazing Fire.

32\. "Further, make him march  
In a chain, whereof  
The length is seventy cubits!

33\. "This was he that  
Would not believe  
In God Most High,

34\. "And would not encourage  
The feeding of the indigent!

35\. "So no friend hath he  
Here this Day.

36\. "Nor hath he any food  
Except the corruption  
From the washing of wounds,

37\. "Which none do eat  
But those in sin."

<span id="page_1602">p. 1602</span>

##### SECTION 2.

38\. So I do  
Call to witness  
What ye see

39\. And what ye see not,

40\. That this is  
Verily the word  
Of an honoured apostle;

41\. It is not the word  
Of a poet:  
Little it is  
Ye believe!

42\. Nor is it the word  
Of a soothsayer:  
Little admonition it is  
Ye receive.

43\. (This is) a Message  
Sent down from the Lord  
Of the Worlds.

44\. And if the apostle  
Were to invent  
Any sayings in Our name,

<span id="page_1603">p. 1603</span>

45\. We should certainly seize him  
By his right hand,

46\. And We should certainly  
Then cut off the artery  
Of his heart:

47\. Nor could any of you  
Withhold him  
(From Our wrath).

48\. But verily this  
Is a Message for  
The God-fearing.

49\. And We certainly know  
That there are amongst you  
Those that reject (it).

50\. But truly (Revelation)  
Is a cause of sorrow  
For the Unbelievers.

51\. But verily it is Truth  
Of assured certainty.

52\. So glorify the name  
Of thy Lord Most High.
