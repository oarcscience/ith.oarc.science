### Sūra III.

### Āl-i-’Imrān, or The Family of ’Imrān.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. A. L. M.

2\. God! There is no god  
But He,—the Living,  
The Self-Subsisting, Eternal.

3\. It is He Who sent down  
To thee (step by step),  
In truth, the Book,  
Confirming what went before it;  
And He sent down the Law  
(Of Moses) and the Gospel  
(Of Jesus) before this,  
As a guide to mankind,  
And He sent down the Criterion  
(Of judgment between right and wrong).

4\. Then those who reject  
Faith in the Signs of God  
Will suffer the severest  
Penalty, and God  
Is Exalted in Might,  
Lord of Retribution.

5\. From God, verily  
Nothing is hidden  
On earth or in the heavens.

6\. He it is Who shapes you  
In the wombs as He pleases.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

There is no god but He,  
The Exalted in Might,  
The Wise.

7\. He it is Who has sent down  
To thee the Book:  
In it are verses  
Basic or fundamental  
(Of established meaning);  
They are the foundation  
Of the Book: others  
Are allegorical. But those  
In whose hearts is perversity follow  
The part thereof that is allegorical,  
Seeking discord, and searching  
For its hidden meanings,  
But ṭo one knows  
Its hidden meanings except God.  
And those who are firmly grounded  
In knowledge say: "We believe  
In the Book; the whole of it  
Is from our Lord:" and none  
Will grasp the Message  
Except men of understanding.

8\. "Our Lord!" (they say),  
"Let not our hearts deviate  
Now after Thou hast guided us,  
But grant us mercy  
From Thine own Presence;  
For Thou art the Grantor  
Of bounties without measure.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

9\. "Our Lord! Thou art He  
That will gather mankind  
Together against a Day about which  
There is no doubt; for God  
Never fails in His promise."

##### SECTION 2.

10\. Whose who reject Faith,—  
Neither their possessions  
Nor their (numerous) progeny  
Will avail them aught  
Against God: they are themselves  
But fuel for the Fire.

11\. (Their plight will be)  
No better than that  
Of the people of Pharaoh,  
And their predecessors:  
They denied our Signs,  
And God called them to account  
For their sins.  
For God is strict  
In punishment.

12\. Say to those who reject Faith:  
"Soon will ye be vanquished  
And gathered together  
To Hell,—an evil bed  
Indeed (to lie on)!

13\. "There has already been  
For you a Sign

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

In the two armies  
That met (in combat):  
One was fighting in the Cause  
Of God, the other  
Resisting God; these saw  
With their own eyes  
Twice their number.  
But God doth support  
With His aid whom He pleaseth.  
In this is a warning  
For such as have eyes to see."

14\. Fair in the eyes of men  
Is the love of things they covet:  
Women and sons;  
Heaped-up hoards  
Of gold and silver; horses  
Branded (for blood and excellence);  
And (wealth of) cattle  
And well-tilled land.  
Such are the possessions  
Of this world's life;  
But in nearness to God  
Is the best of the goals  
(To return to).

15\. Say: Shall I give you  
Glad tidings of things  
Far better than those?  
For the righteous are Gardens

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

In nearness to their Lord,  
With rivers flowing beneath;  
Therein is their eternal home;  
With Companions pure (and holy);  
And the good pleasure of God.  
For in God's sight  
Are (all) His servants,—

16\. (Namely), those who say:  
"Our Lord! we have indeed  
Believed: forgive us, then,  
Our sins, and save us  
From the agony of the Fire;"—

17\. Those who show patience,  
Firmness and self control;  
Who are true (in word and deed);  
Who worship devoutly;  
Who spend (in the way of God);  
And who pray for forgiveness  
In the early hours of the morning.

18\. There is no god but He  
That is the witness of God,  
His angels, and those endued  
With knowledge, standing firm  
On justice. There is no god but He,  
The Exalted in Power,  
The Wise.

19\. The Religion before God  
Is Islam (submission to His Will):  
Nor did the People of the Book  
Dissent therefrom except

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

Through envy of each other,  
After knowledge had come to them.  
But if any deny the Signs of God,  
God is swift in calling to account.

20\. So if they dispute with thee,  
Say: "I have submitted  
My whole self to God  
And so have those  
Who follow me."  
And say to the People of the Book  
And to those who are unlearned:  
"Do ye (also) submit yourselves?"  
If they do, they are in right guidance,  
But if they turn back,  
Thy duty is to convey the Message;  
And in God's sight  
Are (all) His servants.

##### SECTION 3.

21\. As to those who deny  
The Signs of God, and in defiance

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

Of right, slay the prophets,  
And slay those who teach  
Just dealing whith mankind,  
Announce to them a grievous penalty.

22\. They are those whose works  
Will bear no fruit  
In this world  
And in the Hereafter,  
Nor will they have  
Anyone to help.

23\. Hast thou not turned  
Thy vision to those  
Who have been given a portion  
Of the Book? They are  
Invited to the Book of God,  
To settle their dispute,  
But a party of them  
Turn back and decline  
(The arbitration).

24\. This because they say:  
"The Fire shall not touch us  
But for a few numbered days":  
For their forgeries deceive them  
As to their own religion.

25\. But how (will they fare)  
When We gather them together

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

Against a Day about which  
There is no doubt,  
And each soul will be paid out  
Just what it has earned,  
Without (favour or) injustice?

26\. Say: "O God!  
Lord of Power (and Rule),  
Thou givest Power  
To whom Thou pleasest,  
And Thou strippest off Power  
From whom Thou pleasest:  
Thou enduest with honour  
Whom Thou pleasest,  
And Thou bringest low  
Whom Thou pleasest:  
In Thy hand is all Good."  
Verily, over all things  
Thou hast power.

27\. "Thou causest the Night  
To gain on the Day,  
And Thou causest the Day  
To gain on the Night;  
Thou bringest the Living  
Out of the Dead,  
And Thou bringest the Dead  
Out of the Living;  
And Thou givest sustenance  
To whom Thou pleasest,  
Without measure."

28\. let not the Believers  
Take for friends or helpers

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

Unbelievers rather than  
Believers: if any do that,  
In nothing will there be help  
From God: except by way  
Of precaution, that ye may  
Guard yourselves from them,  
But God cautions you  
(To remember) Himself;  
For the final goal  
Is to God.

29\. Say: "Whether ye hide  
What is in your hearts  
Or reveal it,  
God knows it all:  
He knows what is  
In the heavens,  
And what is on earth.  
And God has power  
Over all things.

30\. "On the Day when every soul  
Will be confronted  
With all the good it has done,  
And all the evil it has done,  
It will wish there were  
A great distance  
Between it and its evil.  
But God cautions you  
(To remember) Himself.  
And God is full of kindness  
To those that serve Him."

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

##### SECTION 4.

31\. Say: "If ye do love God,  
Follow me: God will love you  
And forgive you your sins:  
For God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful."

32\. Say: "Obey God  
And His Apostle":  
But if they turn back,  
God loveth not those  
Who reject Faith.

33\. God did choose  
Adam and Noah, the family  
Of Abraham, and the family  
Of ’Imrān above all people,—

34\. Offspring, one of the other:  
And God heareth  
And knoweth all things.

35\. Behold! a woman of ’Imrān  
Said: "O my Lord! I do

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

Dedicate unto Thee  
What is in my womb  
For Thy special service:  
So accept this of me:  
For Thou hearest  
And knowest all things."

36\. When she was delivered,  
She said: "O my Lord!  
Behold! I am delivered  
Of a female child!"—  
And God knew best  
What she brought forth—  
"And nowise is the male  
Like the female.  
I have named her Mary,  
And I commend her  
And her offspring  
To Thy protection  
From the Evil One,  
The Rejected."

37\. Right graciously  
Did her Lord accept her:  
He made her grow  
In purity and beauty:  
To the care of Zakarīya  
Was she assigned.  
Every time that he entered  
(Her) chamber to see her,  
He found her supplied  
With sustenance. He said:  
"O Mary! Whence (comes) this  
To you?" She said:  
"From God: for God  
Provides sustenance  
To whom He pleases,  
Without measure."

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

38\. There here did Zakarīya  
Pray to his Lord, saying:  
"O my Lord! Grant unto me  
From Thee a progeny  
That is pure: for Thou  
Art He that heareth prayer!

39\. While he was standing  
In prayer in the chamber,  
The angels called unto him:  
"God doth give thee  
Glad tidings of Yaḥyā,  
Witnessing the truth  
Of a Word from God, and (be  
Besides) noble, chaste,  
And a Prophet,  
Of the (goodly) company  
Of the righteous."

40\. He said: "O my Lord!  
How shall I have a son,  
Seeing I am very old,  
And my wife is barren?"  
"Thus, "was the answer,  
"Doth God accomplish  
What He willeth,"

41\. He said: "O my Lord!  
Give me a Sign!"  
"Thy Sign, "was the answer,  
"Shall be that thou  
Shalt speak to no man  
For three days  
But with signals.  
Then celebrate  
The praises of thy Lord  
Again and again,  
And glorify Him  
In the evening  
And in the morning."

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

##### SECTION 5.

42\. Behold! the angels said:  
"O Mary! God hath chosen thee  
And purified thee—chosen thee  
Above the women of all nations.

43\. "O Mary! worship  
Thy Lord devoutly:  
Prostrate thyself,  
And bow down (in prayer)  
With those who bow down."

44\. This is part of the tidings  
Of the things unseen,  
Which We reveal unto thee  
(O Apostle!) by inspiration:  
Thou wast not with them  
When they cast lots  
With arrows, as to which  
Of them should be charged  
With the care of Mary:  
Nor wast thou with them  
When they disputed (the point).

45\. Behold! the angels said:  
"O Mary! God giveth thee  
Glad tidings of a Word  
From Him: his name  
Will be Christ Jesus,  
The son of Mary, held in honour  
In this world and the Hereafter  
And of (the company of) those  
Nearest to God;

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

46\. "He shall speak to the people  
In childhood and in maturity.  
And he shall be (of the company)  
Of the righteous."

47\. She said: "O my Lord!  
How shall I have a son  
When no man hath touched me?"  
He said: "Even so:  
God createth  
What He willeth:  
When He hath decreed  
A Plan, He but saith  
To it, 'Be,' and it is!

48\. "And God will teach him  
The Book and Wisdom,  
The Law and the Gospel,

49\. "And (appoint him)  
An apostle to the Children  
Of Israel, (with this message):  
"'I have come to you,  
With a Sign from your Lord,  
In that I make for you  
Out of clay, as it were,  
The figure of a bird,  
And breathe into it,  
And it becomes a bird  
By God's leave:  
And I heal those  
Born blind, and the lepers,  
And I quicken the dead,  
By God's leave;  
And I declare to you  
What ye eat, and what ye store  
In your houses. Surely  
Therein is a Sign for you  
If ye did believe;

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

50\. "'(I have come to you),  
To attest the Law  
Which was before me.  
And to make lawful  
To you part of what was  
(Before) forbidden to you;  
I have come to you  
With a Sign from your Lord.  
So fear God,  
And obey me.

51\. "'It is God  
Who is my Lord  
And your Lord;  
Then worship Him.  
This is a Way  
That is straight.'"

52\. When Jesus found  
Unbelief on their part  
He said: "Who will be  
My helpers to (the work  
Of) God?" Said the Disciples:  
"We are God's helpers:  
We believe in God,  
And do thou bear witness  
That we are Muslims.

53\. "Our Lord! we believe  
In what Thou hast revealed,  
And we follow the Apostle;  
Then write us down  
Among those who bear witness."

54\. And (the unbelievers)  
Plotted and planned,  
And God too planned,  
And the best of planners  
Is God.

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

##### SECTION 6.

55\. Behold! God said:  
"O Jesus! I will take thee  
And raise thee to Myself  
And clear thee (of the falsehoods)  
Of those who blaspheme;  
I will make those  
Who follow thee superior  
To those who reject faith,  
To the Day of Resurrection:  
Then shall ye all  
Return unto me,  
And I will judge  
Between you of the matters  
Wherein ye dispute.

56\. "As to those who reject faith,  
I will punish them  
With terrible agony  
In this world and in the Hereafter,  
Nor will they have  
Anyone to help.

57\. "As to those who believe  
And work righteousness,  
God will pay them (in full)  
Their reward;  
But God loveth not  
Those who do wrong.

58\. "This is what we rehearse  
Unto thee of the Signs  
And the Message  
Of Wisdom."

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

59\. The similitude of Jesus  
Before God is as that of Adam;  
He created him from dust,  
Then said to him, "Be":  
And he was.

60\. The Truth (comes)  
From God alone;  
So be not of those  
Who doubt.

61\. If any one disputes  
In this matter with thee,  
Now after (full) knowledge  
Hath come to thee,  
Say: "Come! let us  
Gather together,  
Our sons and your sons,  
Our women and your women,  
Ourselves and yourselves:  
Then let us earnestly pray,  
And invoke the curse  
Of God on those who lie!"

62\. This is the true account:  
There is no god  
Except God;  
And God—He is indeed

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

The Exalted in Power,  
The Wise.

63\. But if they turn back,  
God hath full knowledge  
Of those who do mischief.

##### SECTION 7.

64\. Say: "O People  
Of the Book! come  
To common terms  
As between us and you:  
That we worship  
None but God;  
That we associate  
No partners with Him;  
That we erect not,  
From among ourselves,  
Lords and patrons  
Other than God."  
If then they turn back,  
Say ye: "Bear witness  
That we (at least)  
Are Muslims (bowing  
To God's Will)."

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

65\. Ye People of the Book!  
Why dispute ye  
About Abraham,  
When the Law and the Gospel  
Were not revealed  
Till after him?  
Have ye no understanding?

66\. Ah! Ye are those  
Who fell to disputing  
(Even) in matters of which  
Ye had some knowledge!  
But why dispute ye  
In matters of which  
Ye have no knowledge?  
It is God Who knows,  
And ye who know not!

67\. Abraham was not a Jew  
Nor yet a Christian;  
But he was true in Faith,  
And bowed his will to God's,  
(Which is Islam),  
And he joined not gods with God.

68\. Without doubt, among men,  
The nearest of kin to Abraham,  
Are those who follow him,  
As are also this Apostle  
And those who believe:  
And God is the Protector  
Of those who have faith.

69\. It is the wish of a section  
Of the People of the Book  
To lead you astray.  
But they shall lead astray  
(Not you), but themselves,  
And they do not perceive!

70\. Ye People of the Book!  
Why reject ye

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

The Signs of God,  
Of which ye are  
(Yourselves) witnesses?

71\. Ye People of the Book!  
Why do ye clothe  
Truth with falsehood,  
And conceal the Truth,  
While ye have knowledge?

##### SECTION 8.

72\. A section of the People  
Of the Book say:  
"Believe in the morning  
What is revealed  
To the Believers,  
But reject it at the end  
Of the day; perchance  
They may (themselves)  
Turn back;

73\. "And believe no one  
Unless he follows  
Your religion."  
Say: "True guidance  
Is the guidance of God:  
(Fear ye) lest a revelation  
Be sent to someone (else)  
Like unto that which was sent  
Unto you? Or that those  
(Receiving such revelation)  
Should engage you in argument  
Before your Lord?"  
Say: "All bounties  
Are in the hand of God:  
He granteth them  
To whom He pleaseth:

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

And God careth for all,  
And He knoweth all things."

74\. For His Mercy He specially chooseth  
Whom He pleaseth;  
For God is the Lord  
Of bounties unbounded.

75\. Among the People of the Book  
Are some who, if entrusted  
With a hoard of gold,  
Will (readily) pay it back;  
Others, who, if entrusted  
With a single silver coin,  
Will not repay it unless  
Thou constantly stoodest  
Demanding, because,  
They say, "there is no call  
On us (to keep faith)  
With these ignorant (Pagans)."  
But they tell a lie against God,  
And (well) they know it.

76\. Nay.—Those that keep  
Their plighted faith  
And act aright,—verily  
God loves those  
Who act aright.

77\. As for those who sell  
The faith they owe to God  
And their own plighted word  
For a small price,  
They shall have no portion  
In the Hereafter:

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

Nor will God  
(Deign to) speak to them  
Or look at them  
On the Day of Judgment,  
Nor will He cleanse them  
(Of sin): they shall have  
A grievous Penalty.

78\. There is among them  
A section who distort  
The Book with their tongues  
(As they read) you would think  
It is a part of the Book,  
But it is no part  
Of the Book; and they say,  
That is from God,"  
But it is not from God:  
It is they who tell  
A lie against God,  
And (well) they know it!

79\. It is not (possible)  
That a man, to whom  
Is given the Book,  
And Wisdom,  
And the Prophetic Office,  
Should say to people:  
"Be ye my worshippers  
Rather than God's":  
On the contrary  
(He would say):  
"Be ye worshippers  
Of Him Who is truly  
The Cherisher of all:  
For ye have taught  
The Book and ye  
Have studied it earnestly."

80\. Nor would he instruct you  
To take angels and prophets  
For Lords and Patrons.  
What! would he bid you

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

To unbelief after ye have  
Bowed your will  
(To God in Islam)?

##### SECTION 9.

81\. Behold! God took  
The Covenant of the Prophets,  
Saying: "I give you  
A Book and Wisdom;  
Then comes to you  
An Apostle, confirming  
What is with you;  
Do ye believe in him  
And render him help."  
God said: "Do ye agree,  
And take this my Covenant  
As binding on you?"  
They said: "We agree."  
He said: "Then bear witness,  
And I am with you  
Among the witnesses."

82\. If any turn back  
After this, they are  
Perverted transgressors.

83\. Do they seek  
For other than the Religion  
Of God?—while all creatures  
In the heavens and on earth  
Have, willing or unwilling,  
Bowed to His Will  
(Accepted Islam),  
And to Him shall they  
All be brought back.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

84\. Say: "We believe  
In God, and in what  
Has been revealed to us  
And what was revealed  
To Abraham, Ismā’īl;  
Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes,  
And in (the Books)  
Given to Moses, Jesus,  
And the Prophets,  
From their Lord:  
We make no distinction  
Between one and another  
Among them, and to God do we  
Bow our will (in Islam)."

85\. If anyone desires  
A religion other than  
Islam (submission to God),  
Never will it be accepted  
Of him; and in the Hereafter  
He will be in the ranks  
Of those who have lost  
(All spiritual good).

86\. How shall God  
Guide those who reject  
Faith after they accepted it  
And bore witness  
That the Apostle was true  
And that Clear Signs  
Had come unto them?  
But God guides not  
A people unjust.

87\. Of such the reward  
Is that on them (rests)

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

The curse of God,  
Of His angels,  
And of all mankind;—

88\. In that will they dwell;  
Nor will their penalty  
Be lightened, nor respite  
Be their (lot);—

89\. Except for those that repent  
(Even) after that,  
And make amends;  
For verily God  
Is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

90\. But those who reject  
Faith after they accepted it,  
And then go on adding  
To their defiance of Faith,—  
Never will their repentance  
Be accepted; for they  
Are those who have  
(Of set purpose) gone astray.

91\. As to those who reject  
Faith, and die rejecting,—  
Never would be accepted  
From any such as much  
Gold as the earth contains,  
Though they should offer it  
For ransom. For such  
Is (in store) a penalty grievous,  
And they will find no helpers.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

##### SECTION 10.

92\. By no means shall ye  
Attain righteousness unless  
Ye give (freely) of that  
Which ye love; and whatever  
Ye give, of a truth  
God knoweth it well.

93\. All food was lawful  
To the Children of Israel,  
Except what Israel  
Made unlawful for itself,  
Before the Law (of Moses)  
Was revealed. Say:  
"Bring ye the Law  
And study it,  
If ye be men of truth."

94\. If any, after this, invent  
A lie and attribute it  
To God, they are indeed  
Unjust wrong-doers.

95\. Say: "God speaketh  
The Truth: follow  
The religion of Abraham,  
The sane in faith; he  
Was not of the Pagans."

96\. The first House (of worship)  
Appointed for men  
Was that at Bakka:  
Full of blessing

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

And of guidance  
For all kinds of beings:

97\. In it are Signs  
Manifest; (for example),  
The Station of Abraham;  
Whoever enters it  
Attains security;  
Pilgrimage thereto is a duty  
Men owe to God,  
Those who can afford  
The journey; but if any  
Deny faith, God stands not  
In need of any of His creatures.

98\. Say: "O People of the Book!  
Why reject ye the Signs  
Of God, when God  
Is Himself witness  
To all ye do?"

99\. Say: "O ye People of the Book!  
Why obstruct ye  
Those who believe,  
From the Path of God,  
Seeking to make it crooked,  
While ye were yourselves  
Witnesses (to God's Covenant)?'  
But God is not unmindful  
Of all that ye do."

100\. O ye who believe!  
If ye listen  
To a faction  
Among the People of the Book,  
They would (indeed)  
Render you apostates  
After ye have believed!

101\. And how would ye  
Deny Faith while unto you  
Are rehearsed the Signs  
Of God, and among you

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

Lives the Apostle?  
Whoever holds  
Firmly to God  
Will be shown  
A Way that is straight.

##### SECTION 11.

102\. O ye who believe!  
Fear God as He should be  
Feared, and die not  
Except in a state  
Of Islam.

103\. And hold fast,  
All together, by the Rope  
Which God (stretches out  
For you), and be not divided  
Among yourselves;  
And remember with gratitude  
God's favour on you;  
For ye were enemies  
And He joined your hearts  
In love, so that by His Grace,  
Ye became brethren;  
And ye were on the brink  
Of the Pit of Fire,  
And He saved you from it.  
Thus doth God make  
His Signs clear to you:  
That ye may be guided.

104\. Let there arise out of you  
A band of people  
Inviting to all that is good,  
Enjoining what is right,

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

And forbidding what is wrong:  
They are the ones  
To attain felicity.

105\. Be not like those  
Who are divided  
Amongst themselves  
And fall into disputations  
After receiving  
Clear Signs:  
For them  
Is a dreadful Penalty,—

106\. On the Day when  
Some faces will be (lit up  
With) white, and some faces  
Will be (in the gloom of) black:  
To those whose faces  
Will be black, (will be said):  
"Did ye reject Faith  
After accepting it?  
Taste then the Penalty  
For rejecting Faith."

107\. But those whose faces  
Will be (lit with) white,—  
They will be in (the light  
Of) God's mercy: therein  
To dwell (for ever).

108\. These are the Signs  
Of God: We rehearse them  
To thee in Truth:  
And God means  
No injustice to any  
Of His creatures.

109\. To God belongs all  
That is in the heavens

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

And on earth: to Him  
Do all questions  
Go back (for decision).

##### SECTION 12.

110\. Ye are the best  
Of Peoples, evolved  
For mankind,  
Enjoining what is right,  
Forbidding what is wrong,  
And believing in God.  
If only the People of the Book  
Had faith, it were best  
For them: among them  
Are some who have faith,  
But most of them  
Are perverted transgressors.

111: They will do you no harm,  
Barring a trifling annoyance;  
If they come out to fight you,  
They will show you their backs,  
And no help shall they get.

112\. Shame is pitched over them  
(Like a tent) wherever  
They are found,  
Except when under a covenant  
(Of protection) from God  
And from men; they draw  
On themselves wrath from God,  
And pitched over them  
Is (the tent of) destitution.  
This because they rejected  
The Signs of God, and slew  
The Prophets in defiance of right;

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

This because they rebelled  
And transgressed beyond bounds.

113\. Not all of them are alike:  
Of the People of the Book  
Are a portion that stand  
(For the right); they rehearse  
The Signs of God all night long,  
And they prostrate themselves  
In adoration.

114\. They believe in God  
And the Last Day;  
They enjoin what is right,  
And forbid what is wrong;  
And they hasten (in emulation)  
In (all) good works:  
They are in the ranks  
Of the righteous.

115\. Of the good that they do,  
Nothing will be rejected  
Of them; for God knoweth well  
Those that do right.

116\. Those who reject Faith,—  
Neither their possessions  
Nor their (numerous) progeny  
Will avail them aught against God:  
They will be Companions  
Of the Fire,—dwelling  
Therein (for ever).

117\. What they spend  
In the life  
Of this (material) world  
May be likened to a Wind  
Which brings a nipping frost:  
It strikes and destroys the harvest  
Of men who have wronged

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

Their own souls: it is not God  
That hath wronged them, but  
They wrong themselves.

118\. O ye who believe!  
Take not into your intimacy  
Those outside your ranks:  
They will not fail  
To corrupt you. They  
Only desire your ruin:  
Rank hatred has already  
Appeared from their mouths:  
What their hearts conceal  
Is far worse.  
We have made plain  
To you the Signs,  
If ye have wisdom.

119\. Ah! ye are those  
Who love them,  
But they love you not,  
Though ye believe  
In the whole of the Book,  
When they meet you,  
They say, "We believe":  
But when they are alone,  
They bite off the very tips  
Of their fingers at you  
In their rage. Say:  
"Perish in your rage;  
God knoweth well  
All the secrets of the heart."

120\. If aught that is good  
Befalls you, it grieves them;  
But if some misfortune  
Overtakes you, they rejoice

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

At it. But if ye are constant  
And do right,  
Not the least harm  
Will their cunning  
Do to you; for God  
Compasseth round about  
All that they do.

##### SECTION 13.

121\. Remember that morning  
Thou didst leave  
Thy household (early)  
To post the Faithful  
At their stations for battle:  
And God heareth  
And knoweth all things:

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

122\. Rememer two of your parties  
Meditated cowardice;  
But God was their protector,  
And in God should the Faithful  
(Ever) put their trust.

123\. God had helped you  
At Badr, when ye were  
A contemptible little force;  
Then fear God; thus  
May ye show your gratitude.

124\. Remember thou saidst  
To the Faithful: "Is it not enough  
For you that God should help you  
With three thousand angels  
(Specially) sent down?

125\. "Yea,—if ye remain firm,  
And act aright, even if  
The enemy should rush here  
On you in hot haste,  
Your Lord would help you  
With five thousand angels  
Making a terrific onslaught."

126\. God made it but a message  
Of hope for you, and an assurance  
To your hearts: (in any case)  
There is no help  
Except from God,  
The Exalted, the Wise:

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

127\. That He might cut off  
A fringe of the Unbelievers  
Or expose them to infamy,  
And they should then  
Be turned back,  
Frustrated of their purpose.

128\. Not for thee, (but for God),  
Is the decision:  
Whether He turn in mercy  
To them, or punish them;  
For they are indeed wrong-doers.

129\. To God belongeth all  
That is in the heavens  
And on earth.  
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth  
And punisheth whom He pleaseth  
But God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 14.

130\. ye who believe!  
Devour not Usury,  
Doubled and multiplied;  
But fear God; that  
Ye may (really) prosper.

131\. Fear the Fire, which is prepared  
For those who reject Faith:

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

132\. And obey God  
And the Apostle;  
That ye may obtain mercy.

133\. Be quick in the race  
For forgiveness from your Lord,  
And for a Garden whose width  
Is that (of the whole)  
Of the heavens  
And of the earth,  
Prepared for the righteous,—

134\. Those who spend (freely),  
Whether in prosperity,  
Or in adversity;  
Who restrain anger,  
And pardon (all) men;—  
For God loves those  
Who do good;—

135\. And those who,  
Having done something  
To be ashamed of,  
Or wronged their own souls,  
Earnestly bring God to mind,  
And ask for forgiveness  
For their sins,  
And who can forgive  
Sins except God?—  
And are never obstinate  
In persisting knowingly  
In (the wrong) they have done

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

136\. For such the reward  
Is forgiveness from their Lord,  
And Gardens with rivers  
Flowing underneath,—  
An eternal dwelling:  
How excellent a recompense  
For those who work (and strive)!

137\. Many were the Ways of Life  
That have passed away  
Before you: travel through  
The earth, and see what was  
The end of those  
Who rejected Truth.

138\. Here is a plain statement  
To men, a guidance  
And instruction to those  
Who fear God!

139\. So lose not heart,  
Nor fall into despair:  
For ye must gain mastery  
If ye are true in Faith.

140\. If a wound hath touched you,  
Be sure a similar wound  
Hath touched the others.  
Such days (of varying fortunes)  
We give to men and men  
By turns: that God may know  
Those that believe,  
And that He may take  
To Himself from your ranks  
Martyr-witnesses (to Truth).  
And God loveth not  
Those that do wrong.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

141\. God's object also is to purge  
Those that are true in Faith  
And to deprive of blessing  
Those that resist Faith.

142\. Did ye think that ye  
Would enter Heaven  
Without God testing  
Those of you who fought hard  
(In His Cause) and  
Remained steadfast?

143\. Ye did indeed  
Wish for Death  
Before ye met him:  
Now ye have seen him  
With your own eyes,  
(And ye flinch!)

##### SECTION 15.

144\. Muhammad is no more  
Than an Apostle: many  
Were the Apostles that passed away  
Before him. If he died  
Or were slain, will ye then  
Turn back on your heels?  
If any did turn back  
On his heels, not the least  
Harm will he do to God;  
But God (on the other hand)  
Will swiftly reward those  
Who (serve him) with gratitude.

145\. Nor can a soul die  
Except by God's leave,

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

The term being fixed  
As by writing. If any  
Do desire a reward  
In this life, We shall give it  
To him; and if any  
Do desire a reward  
In the Hereafter, We shall  
Give it to him.  
And swiftly shall We reward  
Those that (serve us with) gratitude.

146\. How many of the Prophets  
Fought (in God's way),  
And with them (fought)  
Large bands of godly men?  
But they never lost heart  
If they met with disaster  
In God's way, nor did  
They weaken (in will)  
Nor give in. And God  
Loves those who are  
Firm and steadfast.

147\. All that they said was:  
"Our Lord! forgive us  
Our sins and anything  
We may have done  
That transgressed our duty:  
Establish our feet firmly,  
And help us against  
Those that resist  
Faith."

148\. And God gave them  
A reward in this world,  
And the excellent reward  
Of the Hereafter. For God  
Loveth those who do good.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

##### SECTION 16.

149\. O ye who believe!  
If ye obey the Unbelievers,  
They will drive you back  
On your heels, and ye  
Will turn back (from Faith)  
To your own loss.

150\. Nay, God is your Protector,  
And He is the best of helpers.

151\. Soon shall We cast terror  
Into the hearts of the Unbelievers  
For that they joined companions  
With God, for which He had sew  
No authority: their abode  
Will be the Fire: and evil  
Is the home of the wrong-doers!

152\. God did indeed fulfil  
His promise to you  
When ye with His permission  
Were about to annihilate  
Your enemy,—until ye flinched  
And fell to disputing  
About the order,  
And disobeyed it  
After He brought you in sight  
(Of the Booty) which ye covet.  
Among you are some  
That hanker after this world  
And some that desire  
The Hereafter. Then did He

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

Divert you from your foes  
In order to test you.  
But He forgave you:  
For God is full of grace  
To those who believe.

153\. Behold! ye were climbing up  
The high ground, without even  
Casting a side glance  
At any one, and the Apostle  
In your rear was calling you  
Back. There did God give you  
One distress after another  
By way of requital,  
To teach you not to grieve  
For (the booty) that had escaped you  
And for (the ill) that had befallen you.  
For God is well aware  
Of all that ye do.

154\. After (the excitement)  
Of the distress, He sent down  
Calm on a band of you  
Overcome with slumber,  
While another band  
Was stirred to anxiety  
By their own feelings,  
Moved by wrong suspicions  
Of God—suspicions due  
To Ignorance. They said:  
"What affair is this of ours?"  
Say thou: "Indeed, this affair

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Is wholly God's." They hide  
In their minds what they  
Dare not reveal to thee.  
They say (to themselves):  
"If we had had anything  
To do with this affair,  
We should not have been  
In the slaughter here."  
Say: "Even if you had remained  
In your homes, those  
For whom death was decreed  
Would certainly have gone forth  
To the place of their death";  
But (all this was)  
That God might test  
What is in your breasts  
And purge what is  
In your hearts.  
For God knoweth well  
The secrets of your hearts.

155\. Those of you  
Who turned back  
On the day the two hosts  
Met,—it was Satan  
Who caused them to fail,  
Because of some (evil)  
They had done. But God  
Has blotted out (their fault):  
For God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Forbearing.

##### SECTION 17.

156\. O ye who believe!  
Be not like the Unbelievers,  
Who say of their brethren,  
When they are travelling  
Through the earth or engaged  
In fighting: "If they had stayed  
With us, they would not  
Have died, or been slain."

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

This that God may make it  
A cause of sighs and regrets  
In their hearts. It is God  
That gives Life and Death,  
And God sees well  
All that ye do.

157\. And if ye are slain, or die,  
In the way of God,  
Forgiveness and mercy  
From God are far better  
Than all they could amass.

158\. And if ye die, or are slain,  
Lo! it is-unto God  
That ye are brought together.

159\. It is part of the Mercy  
Of God that thou dost deal  
Gently with them.  
Wert thou severe  
Or harsh-hearted,  
They would have broken away  
From about thee: so pass over  
(Their faults), and ask  
For (God's) forgiveness  
For them; and consult  
Them in affairs (of moment).  
Then, when thou hast  
Taken a decision,  
Put thy trust in God.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

For God loves those  
Who put their trust (in Him).

160\. If God helps you,  
Non can overcome you:  
If He forsakes you,  
Who is there, after that,  
That can help you?  
In God, then,  
Let Believers put their trust.

161\. No prophet could (ever)  
Be false to his trust.  
If any person is so false,  
He shall, on the Day  
Of Judgment, restore  
What he misappropriated;  
Then shall every soul  
Receive its due,—  
Whatever it earned,—  
And none shall be  
Dealt with unjustly.

162\. Is the man who follows  
The good pleasure of God  
Like the man who draws  
On himself the wrath  
Of God, and whose abode  
Is in Hell?—  
A woeful refuge!

163\. They are in varying grades  
In the sight of God,  
And God sees well  
All that they do.

164\. God did confer  
A great favour

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

On the Believers  
When He sent among them  
An Apostle from among  
Themselves, rehearsing  
Unto them the Signs  
Of God, sanctifying them,  
And instructing them  
In Scripture and Wisdom,  
While, before that,  
They had been  
In manifest error.

165\. What! When a single  
Disaster smites you,  
Although ye smote (your enemies)  
With one twice as great,  
Do ye say?—  
"Whence is this?"  
Say (to them):  
"It is from yourselves:  
For God hath power  
Over all things."

166\. What ye suffered  
On the day the two armies  
Met, was with the leave  
Of God, in order that  
He might test the Believers,—

167\. And the Hypocrites also.  
These were told: "Come,  
Fight in the way of God,  
Or (at least) drive  
(The foe from Your city)."  
They said: "Had we known  
How to fight, we should  
Certainly have followed you."

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

They were that day  
Nearer to Unbelief  
Than to Faith,  
Saying with their lips  
What was not in their hearts.  
But God hath full knowledge  
Of all they conceal.

168\. (They are) the ones that say,  
(Of their brethren slain),  
While they themselves  
Sit (at ease): "If only  
They had listened to us,  
They would not have been slain."  
Say: "Avert death  
From your own selves,  
If ye speak the truth."

169\. Think not of those  
Who are slain in God's way  
As dead. Nay, they live,  
Finding their sustenance  
In the Presence of their Lord;

170\. They rejoice in the Bounty  
Provided by God:  
And with regard to those  
Left behind, who have not  
Yet joined them (in their bliss),  
The (Martyrs) glory in the fact  
That on them is no fear,  
Nor have they (cause to) grieve.

171\. They glory in the Grace  
And the Bounty from God,  
And in the fact that  
God suffereth not

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

The reward of the Faithful  
To be lost (in the least).

##### SECTION 18.

172\. Of those who answered  
The call of God  
And the Apostle,  
Even after being wounded,  
Those who do right  
And refrain from wrong  
Have a great reward;—

173\. Men said to them:  
"A great army is gathering  
Against you":  
And frightened them:  
But it (only) increased  
Their Faith: they said:  
"For us God sufficeth,  
And He is the best  
Disposer of affairs."

174\. And they returned  
With Grace and Bounty  
From God: no harm  
Ever touched them:  
For they followed  
The good pleasure of God:  
And God is the Lord  
Of bounties unbounded.

175\. It is only the Evil One  
That suggests to you  
The fear of his votaries:  
Be ye not afraid  
Of them, but fear Me,  
If ye have Faith.

176\. Let not those grieve thee  
Who rush headlong  
Into Unbelief:  
Not the least harm  
Will they do to God:  
God's Plan is that He

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

Will give them no portion  
In the Hereafter,  
But a severe punishment.

177\. Those who purchase  
Unbelief at the price  
Of faith,  
Not the least harm  
Will they do to God,  
But they will have  
A grievous punishment.

178\. Let not the Unbelievers  
Think that Our respite  
To them is good for themselves:  
We grant them respite  
That they may grow  
In their iniquity:  
But they will have  
A shameful punishment.

179\. God will not leave  
The Believers in the state  
In which ye are now,  
Until He separates  
What is evil  
From what is good.  
Nor will He disclose  
To you the secrets  
Of the Unseen,  
But He chooses  
Of His Apostles  
(For the purpose)  
Whom He pleases.  
So believe in God  
And His Apostles:  
And if ye believe  
And do right,  
Ye have a reward  
Without measure.

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

180\. And let not those  
Who covetously withhold  
Of the gifts which God  
Hath given them of His Grace,  
Think that it is good for them:  
Nay, it will be the worse  
For them: soon shall the things  
Which they covetously withheld  
Be tied to their necks  
Like a twisted collar,  
On the Day of Judgment.  
To God belongs the heritage  
Of the heavens and the earth;  
And God is well-acquainted  
With all that ye do.

##### SECTION 19.

181\. God hath heard  
The taunt of those  
Who say: "Truly, God  
Is indigent and we  
Are rich!"—We shall  
Certainly record their word

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

And (their act) of slaying  
The Prophets in defiance  
Of right, and We shall say:  
"Taste ye the Penalty  
Of the Scorching Fire!

182\. "This is because  
Of the (unrighteous deeds)  
Which your hands  
Sent on before ye:  
For God never harms  
Those who serve Him."

183\. They (also) said: "God took  
Our promise not to believe  
In an apostle unless  
He showed us a sacrifice  
Consumed by fire  
(From heaven)." Say:  
"There came to you  
Apostles before me,  
With Clear Signs  
And even with what  
Ye ask for: why then  
Did ye slay them,  
If ye speak the truth?"

184\. Then if they reject thee,  
So were rejected apostles  
Before thee, who came  
With Clear Signs,  
Books of dark prophecies,  
And the Book of Enlightenment.

185\. Every soul shall have  
A taste of death:  
And only on the Day  
Of Judgment shall you  
Be paid your full recompense.  
Only he who is saved  
Far from the Fire  
And admitted to the Garden  
Will have attained  
The object (of Life):  
For the life of this world  
Is but goods and chattels  
Of deception.

186\. Ye shall certainly  
Be tried and tested  
In your possessions  
And in your personal selves;  
And ye shall certainly  
Hear much that will grieve you,  
From those who received  
The Book before yot:  
And from those who  
Worship many gods.  
But if ye persevere  
Patiently, and guard  
Against evil,—then  
That will be  
A determining factor  
In all affairs.

187\. And remember  
God took a Covenant  
From the People of the Book,  
To make it known  
And clear to mankind,  
And not to hide it;

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

But they threw it away  
Behind their backs,  
And purchased with it  
Some miserable gain!  
And vile was the bargain  
They made!

188\. Think not that those  
Who exult in what they  
Have brought about, and love  
To be praised for what  
They have not done,—  
Think not that they  
Can escape the Penalty.  
For them is a Penalty  
Grievous indeed.

189\. To God belongeth  
The dominion  
Of the heavens  
And the earth;  
And God hath power  
Over all things.

##### SECTION 20.

190\. Behold! In the creation  
Of the heavens and the earth,  
And the alternation  
Of Night and Day,—  
There are indeed Signs  
For men of understanding,—

191\. Men who celebrate  
The praises of God,  
Standing, sitting,  
And lying down on their sides,  
And contemplate  
The (wonders of) creation

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

In the heavens and the earth,  
(With the thought):  
"Our Lord! not for naught  
Hast Thou created (all) this!  
Glory to Thee! Give us  
Salvation from the Penalty  
Of the Fire.

192\. "Our Lord! any whom Thou  
Dost admit to the Fire,  
Truly Thou coverest with shame,  
And never will wrong-doers  
Find any helpers!

193\. "Our Lord! we have heard  
The call of one calling  
(Us) to Faith, 'Believe ye  
In the Lord,' and we  
Have believed. Our Lord!  
Forgive us our sins,  
Blot out from us  
Our iniquities, and take  
To Thyself our souls  
In the company of the righteous.

194\. "Our Lord! Grant us  
What Thou didst promise  
Unto us through Thine Apostles,  
And save us from shame  
On the Day of Judgment:  
For Thou never breakest  
Thy promise."

195\. And their Lord hath accepted  
Of them, and answered them:  
"Never will I suffer to be lost  
The work of any of you,

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

Be he male or female:  
Ye are members, one of another:  
Those who have left their homes,  
Or been driven out therefrom,  
Or suffered harm in My Cause,  
Or fought or been slain,—  
Verily, I will blot out  
From them their iniquities,  
And admit them into Gardens  
With rivers flowing beneath;—  
A reward from the Presence  
Of God, and from His Presence  
Is the best of rewards."

196\. Let not the strutting about  
Of the Unbelievers  
Through the land  
Deceive thee:

197\. Little is it for enjoyment:  
Their ultimate abode  
Is Hell: what an evil bed  
(To lie on)!

198\. On the other hand, for those  
Who fear their Lord,  
Are Gardens, with rivers  
Flowing beneath; therein  
Are they to dwell (for ever),—  
A gift from the Presence  
Of God; and that which is  
In the Presence of God  
Is the best (bliss)  
For the righteous.

199\. And there are, certainly,  
Among the People of the Book,

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

Those who believe in God,  
In the revelation to you,  
And in the revelation to them,  
Bowing in humility to God:  
They will not sell  
The Signs of God  
For a miserable gain!  
For them is a reward  
With their Lord,  
And God is swift in account.

200\. O ye who believe!  
Persevere in patience  
And constancy; vie  
In such perseverance;  
Strengthen each other;  
And fear God;  
That ye may prosper.
