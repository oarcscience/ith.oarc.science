### Sūra LIII.

### *Najm,* or the Star.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. By the Star  
When it goes down,—

2\. Your Companion is neither  
Astray nor being misled,

3\. Nor does he say (aught)  
Of (his own) Desire.

4\. It is no less than  
Inspiration sent down to him:

5\. He was taught by one  
Mighty in Power,

6\. Endued with Wisdom:  
For he appeared  
(In stately form)

<span id="page_1444">p. 1444</span>

7\. While he was in  
The highest part  
Of the horizon:

8\. Then he approached  
And came closer,

9\. And was at a distance  
Of but two bow-lengths  
Or (even) nearer;

10\. So did (God) convey  
The inspiration to His Servant—  
(Conveyed) what He (meant)  
To convey.

11\. The (Prophet's) (mind and) heart  
In no way falsified  
That which he saw.

12\. Will ye then dispute  
With him concerning  
What he saw?

13\. For indeed he saw him  
At a second descent,

14\. Near the Lote-tree  
Beyond which none may pass:

<span id="page_1445">p. 1445</span>

15\. Near it is the Garden  
Of Abode.

16\. Behold, the Lote-tree  
Was shrouded  
(In mystery unspeakable!)

17\. (His) sight never swerved,  
Nor did it go wrong!

18\. For truly did he see,  
Of the Signs of his Lord,  
The Greatest!

19\. Have ye seen  
Lāt, and ‘Uzzā,

20\. And another,  
The third (goddess), Manāt?

21\. What! For you  
The male sex,  
And for Him, the female?

22\. Behold, such would be  
Indeed a division  
Most unfair!

<span id="page_1446">p. 1446</span>

23\. These are nothing but names  
Which ye have devised,—  
Ye and your fathers,  
For which God has sent  
Down no authority (whatever).  
They follow nothing but  
Conjecture and what  
Their own souls desire!—  
Even though there has already  
Come to them Guidance  
From their Lord!

24\. Nay, shall man have (just)  
Anything he hankers after?

25\. But it is to God  
That the End and  
The Beginning (of all things)  
Belong.

##### SECTION 2.

26\. How many-so-ever be  
The angels in the heavens,  
Their intercession will avail nothing  
Except after God has given  
Leave for whom He pleases  
And that he is acceptable  
To Him.

<span id="page_1447">p. 1447</span>

27\. Those who believe not  
In the Hereafter, name  
The angels with female names.

28\. But they have no knowledge  
Therein. They follow nothing  
But conjecture; and conjecture  
Avails nothing against Truth.

29\. Therefore shun those who  
Turn away from Our Message  
And desire nothing but  
The life of this world.

30\. That is as far as  
Knowledge will reach them.  
Verily thy Lord knoweth best  
Those who stray from  
His Path, and He knoweth  
Best those who receive guidance.

31\. Yea, to God belongs all  
That is in the heavens  
And on earth: so that  
He rewards those who do  
Evil, according to their deeds,  
And He rewards those who  
Do good, with what is best.

32\. Those who avoid  
Great sins and shameful deeds,

<span id="page_1448">p. 1448</span>

Only (falling into) small faults,  
Verily thy Lord is ample  
In forgiveness. He knows  
You well when He brings  
You out of the earth,  
And when ye are hidden  
In your mothers’ wombs.  
Therefore justify not yourselves;  
He knows best who it is  
That guards against evil.

##### SECTION 3.

33\. Seest thou one  
Who turns back,

34\. Gives a little,  
Then hardens (his heart)?

<span id="page_1449">p. 1449</span>

35\. What! Has he knowledge  
Of the unseen  
So that he can see?

36\. Nay, is he not acquainted  
With what is in the books  
Of Moses—

37\. And of Abraham  
Who fulfilled his  
engagements;—

38\. Namely, that no bearer  
Of burdens can bear  
The burden of another;

39\. That man can have nothing  
But what he strives for;

40\. That (the fruit of) his striving  
Will soon come in sight;

41\. Then will he be rewarded  
With a reward complete;

42\. That to thy Lord  
Is the final Goal;

<span id="page_1450">p. 1450</span>

43\. That it is He Who  
Granteth Laughter and Tears;

44\. That it is He Who  
Granteth Death and Life;

45\. That He did create  
In pairs,—male and female,

46\. From a seed when lodged  
(In its place);

47\. That He hath promised  
A Second Creation  
(Raising of the Dead);

48\. That it is He Who  
Giveth wealth and satisfaction;

49\. That He is the Lord  
Of Sirius (the Mighty Star);

50\. And that it is He  
Who destroyed the (powerful)  
Ancient ‘Ād (people),

<span id="page_1451">p. 1451</span>

51\. And the <u>Th</u>amūd,  
Nor gave them a lease  
Of perpetual life.

52\. And before them,  
The people of Noah,  
For that they were (all)  
Most unjust  
And most insolent transgressors,

53\. And He destroyed  
The Overthrown Cities  
(Of Sodom and Gomorrah),

54\. So that (ruins unknown)  
Have covered them up.

55\. Then which of the gifts  
Of thy Lord, (O man,)  
Wilt thou dispute about?

56\. This is a Warner,  
Of the (series of) Warners  
Of old!

57\. The (Judgment) ever approaching  
Draws nigh:

58\. No (soul) but God  
Can lay it bare.

59\. Do ye then wonder  
At this recital?

<span id="page_1452">p. 1452</span>

60\. And will ye laugh  
And not weep,—

61\. Wasting your time  
In vanities?

62\. But fall ye down in prostration  
To God, and adore (Him)!

<span id="page_1453">p. 1453</span>
