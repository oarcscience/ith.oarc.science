### Sūra XXXIX.

### *Zumar,* or the Crowds.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. The revelation  
Of this Book  
Is from God,  
The Exalted in Power,  
Full of Wisdom.

2\. Verily it is We Who have  
Revealed the Book to thee  
In Truth: so serve God,  
Offering Him sincere devotion.

3\. Is it not to God  
That sincere devotion  
Is due? But those who  
Take for protectors others  
Than God (say): "We only  
Serve them in order that  
They may bring us nearer  
To God." Truly God  
Will judge between them  
In that wherein they differ.  
But God guides not  
Such as are false  
And ungrateful.

<span id="page_1237">p. 1237</span>

4\. Had God wished  
To take to Himself  
A son, He could have  
Chosen whom He pleased  
Out of those whom He  
Doth create: but Glory  
Be to Him! (He is above  
Such things.) He is God,  
The One, the Irresistible.

5\. He created the heavens  
And the earth  
In true (proportions):  
He makes the Night  
Overlap the Day, and the Day  
Overlap the Night:  
He has subjected  
The sun and the moon  
(To His law):  
Each one follows a course  
For a time appointed.  
Is not He the Exalted  
In Power—He Who forgives  
Again and again?

6\. He created you (all)  
From a single Person:  
Then created, of like nature,  
His mate; and He  
Sent down for you eight head  
Of cattle in pairs:  
He makes you,  
In the wombs

<span id="page_1238">p. 1238</span>

Of your mothers,  
In stages, one after another,  
In three veils of darkness.  
Such is God, your Lord  
And Cherisher: to Him belongs  
(All) dominion. There is  
No god but He: then  
How are ye turned away  
(From your true Centre)?

7\. If ye reject (God),  
Truly God hath no need  
Of you; but He liketh not  
Ingratitude from His servants:  
If ye are grateful, He  
Is pleased with you.  
No bearer of burdens  
Can bear the burden  
Of another. In the End,  
To your Lord is your Return,  
When He will tell you  
The truth of all  
That ye did (in this life).  
For He knoweth well  
All that is in (men's) hearts.

8\. When some trouble toucheth man,  
He crieth unto his Lord,

<span id="page_1239">p. 1239</span>

Turning to Him in repentance:  
But when He bestoweth  
A favour upon him  
As from Himself, (man)  
Doth forget what he cried  
And prayed for before,  
And he doth set up  
Rivals unto God,  
Thus misleading others  
From God's Path.  
Say, "Enjoy thy blasphemy  
For a little while:  
Verily thou art (one)  
Of the Companions of the Fire!"

9\. Is one who worships devoutly  
During the hours of the night  
Prostrating himself or standing  
(In adoration), who takes heed  
Of the Hereafter, and who  
Places his hope in the Mercy  
Of his Lord—(like one  
Who does not)? Say:  
"Are those equal, those who know  
And those who do not know?  
It is those who are  
Endued with understanding  
That receive admonition.

##### SECTION 2.

10\. Say: "O ye  
My servants who believe!  
Fear your Lord.  
Good is (the reward)  
For those who do good  
In this world.

<span id="page_1240">p. 1240</span>

Spacious is God's earth!  
Those who patiently persevere  
Will truly receive  
A reward without measure!"

11\. Say: "Verily, I am commanded  
To serve God  
With sincere devotion;

12\. "And I am commanded  
To be the first  
Of those who bow  
To God in Islam."

13\. Say: "I would, if I  
Disobeyed my Lord,  
Indeed have fear  
Of the Penalty  
Of a Mighty Day."

14\. Say: "It is God I serve,  
With my sincere  
(And exclusive) devotion:

15\. "Serve ye what ye will  
Besides Him." Say:  
"Truly, those in loss  
Are those who lose  
Their own souls  
And their People  
On the Day of Judgment:  
Ah! that is indeed  
The (real and) evident Loss!

<span id="page_1241">p. 1241</span>

16\. They shall have Layers  
Of Fire above them,  
And Layers (of Fire)  
Below them: with this  
Doth God warn off  
His Servants: "O My Servants!  
Then fear ye Me!"

17\. Those who eschew Evil,  
And fall not into  
Its worship,—and turn  
To God (in repentance),—  
For them is Good News:  
So announce the Good News  
To My Servants,—

18\. Those who listen  
To the Word,  
And follow  
The best (meaning) in it:  
Those are the ones  
Whom God has guided, and those  
Are the ones endued  
With understanding.

19\. Is, then, one against whom  
The decree of Punishment

<span id="page_1242">p. 1242</span>

Is justly due (equal  
To one who eschews evil)?  
Wouldst thou, then, deliver  
One (who is) in the Fire?

20\. But it is for those  
Who fear their Lord,  
That lofty mansions,  
One above another,  
Have been built:  
Beneath them flow  
Rivers (of delight): (such is)  
The Promise of God:  
Never doth God fail in  
(His) promise.

21\. Seest thou not that God  
Sends down rain from  
The sky, and leads it  
Through springs in the earth.?  
Then He causes to grow,  
Therewith, produce of various  
Colours: then it withers;  
Thou wilt see it grow yellow;  
Then He makes it  
Dry up and crumble away.  
Truly, in this, is  
A Message of remembrance to  
Men of understanding.

<span id="page_1243">p. 1243</span>

##### SECTION 3.

22\. Is one whose heart  
God has opened to Islam,  
So that he has received  
Enlightenment from God,  
(No better than one hard-hearted)?  
Woe to those whose hearts  
Are hardened against celebrating  
The praises of God! They  
Are manifestly wandering  
(In error)!

23\. God has revealed  
(From time to time)  
The most beautiful Message  
In the form of a Book,  
Consistent with itself,  
(Yet) repeating (its teaching

<span id="page_1244">p. 1244</span>

In various aspects):  
The skins of those who  
Fear their Lord tremble  
Thereat; then their skins  
And their hearts do soften  
To the celebration of  
God's praises. Such is  
The guidance of God:  
He guides therewith  
Whom He pleases, but such  
As God leaves to stray,  
Can have none to guide.

24\. Is, then, one who  
Has to fear the brunt  
Of the Penalty on the Day  
Of Judgment (and receive it)  
On his face, (like one  
Guarded therefrom)? It will

<span id="page_1245">p. 1245</span>

Be said to the wrong-doers:  
"Taste ye (the fruits  
Of) what ye earned!

25\. Those before them (also)  
Rejected (revelation), and so  
The Punishment came to them  
From directions they did not  
Perceive.

26\. So God gave them  
A taste of humiliation  
In the present life,  
But greater is the Punishment  
Of the Hereafter,  
If they only knew!

27\. We have put forth  
For men, in this Qur-ān  
Every kind of Parable,  
In order that they  
May receive admonition.

28\. (It is) a Qur-ān  
In Arabic, without any

<span id="page_1246">p. 1246</span>

Crookedness (therein):  
In order that they  
May guard against Evil.

29\. God puts forth a Parable—  
A man belonging to many  
Partners at variance with each other,  
And a man belonging entirely  
To one master: are those two  
Equal in comparison?  
Praise be to God!  
But most of them  
Have no knowledge.

30\. Truly thou wilt die  
(One day), and truly they  
(Too) will die (one day).

31\. In the End will ye  
(All), on the Day  
Of Judgment, settle your disputes  
In the presence of your Lord.

<span id="page_1247">p. 1247</span>

##### SECTION 4.

32\. Who, then, doth more wrong  
Than one who utters  
A lie concerning God,  
And rejects the Truth  
When it comes to him  
Is there not in Hell  
An abode for blasphemers?

33\. And he who brings the Truth  
And he who confirms  
(And supports) it—such are  
The men who do right.

34\. They shall have all  
That they wish for,  
In the presence of their Lord:  
Such is the reward  
Of those who do good:

35\. So that God will  
Turn off from them  
(Even) the worst in their deeds  
And give them their reward  
According to the best  
Of what they have done.

<span id="page_1248">p. 1248</span>

36\. Is not God enough  
For His servant? But  
They try to frighten thee  
With other (gods) besides Him!  
For such as God leaves  
To stray, there can be  
No guide.

37\. And such as God doth  
Guide there can be  
None to lead astray.  
Is not God Exalted  
In Power, (Able to enforce  
His Will), Lord of Retribution?

38\. If indeed thou ask them  
Who it is that created  
The heavens and the earth,  
They would be sure to say.  
"God ". Say: "See ye then?  
The things that ye invoke  
Besides God,—can they,  
If God wills some Penalty  
For me, remove His Penalty?—  
Or if He wills some Grace  
For me, can they keep back

<span id="page_1249">p. 1249</span>

His Grace?" Say: "Sufficient  
Is God for me!  
In Him trust those  
Who put their trust."

39\. Say: "O my people!  
Do whatever ye can:  
I will do (my part):  
But soon will ye know—

40\. "Who it is to whom  
Comes a Penalty  
Of ignominy, and on whom  
Descends a Penalty that abides."

41\. Verily We have revealed  
The Book to thee  
In Truth, for (instructing)  
mankind.  
He, then, that receives guidance  
Benefits his own soul:  
But he that strays  
Injures his own soul.  
Nor art thou set  
Over them to dispose  
Of their affairs.

##### SECTION 5.

42\. It is God that takes  
The souls (of men) at death;

<span id="page_1250">p. 1250</span>

And those that die not  
(He takes) during their sleep:  
Those on whom He  
Has passed the decree  
Of death, He keeps back  
(From returning to life),  
But the rest He sends  
(To their bodies)  
For a term appointed.  
Verily in this are Signs  
For those who reflect.

43\. What! Do they take  
For intercessors others  
Besides God? Say: "Even if  
They have no power whatever  
And no intelligence?"

44\. Say: "To God belongs  
Exclusively (the right

<span id="page_1251">p. 1251</span>

To grant) Intercession:  
To Him belongs the dominion  
Of the heavens and the earth:  
In the End, it is to Him  
That ye shall be  
Brought back."

45\. When God, the One and Only,  
Is mentioned, the hearts  
Of those who believe not  
In the Hereafter are filled  
With disgust and horror;  
But when (gods) other than He  
Are mentioned, behold,  
They are filled with joy!

46\. Say: "O God!  
Creator of the heavens  
And the earth!  
Knower of all that is  
Hidden and open!  
It is Thou that wilt  
Judge between Thy Servants  
In those matters about which  
They have differed."

47\. Even if the wrong-doers  
Had all that there is  
On earth, and as much more,  
(In vain) would they offer it

<span id="page_1252">p. 1252</span>

For ransom from the pain  
Of the Penalty on the Day  
Of Judgment: but something  
Will confront them from God,  
Which they could never  
Have counted upon!

48\. For the evils of their Deeds  
Will confront them,  
And they will be (completely)  
Encircled by that which  
They used to mock at!

49\. Now, when trouble touches man,  
He cries to Us:  
But when We bestow  
A favour upon him  
As from Ourselves,  
He says, "This has been  
Given to me because of  
A certain knowledge (I have)!"  
Nay, but this is  
But a trial, but most  
Of them understand not!

50\. Thus did the (generations)  
Before them say! But  
All that they did  
Was of no profit to them.

51\. Nay, the evil results  
Of their deeds overtook them.  
And the wrong-doers  
Of this (generation)  
The evil results of their deeds  
Will soon overtake them (too),

<span id="page_1253">p. 1253</span>

And they will never be  
Able to frustrate (Our Plan)!

52\. Know they not that  
God enlarges the provision  
Or restricts it, for any  
He pleases? Verily, in this are  
Signs for those who believe!

##### SECTION 6.

53\. Say: "O my Servants who  
Have transgressed against their souls  
Despair not of the Mercy  
Of God: for God forgives  
All sins: for He is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

54\. "Turn ye to your Lord  
(In repentance) and bow  
To His (Will), before  
The Penalty comes on you:  
After that ye shall not  
Be helped.

<span id="page_1254">p. 1254</span>

55\. "And follow the Best  
Of (the courses) revealed  
To you from your Lord,  
Before the Penalty comes  
On you—of a sudden,  
While ye perceive not!—

56\. "Lest the soul should (then)  
Say: "Ah! woe is me!—  
In that I neglected  
(My Duty) towards God,  
And was but among those  
Who mocked!"—

57\. "Or (lest) it should say:  
"If only God had guided  
Me, I should certainly  
Have been among the righteous!"—

58\. "Or (lest) it should say  
When it (actually) sees  
The Penalty, "If only  
I had another chance,  
I should certainly be  
Among those who do good!"

59\. "(The reply will be:) "Nay,  
But there came to thee

<span id="page_1255">p. 1255</span>

My Signs, and thou didst  
Reject them: thou vast  
Haughty, and became one  
Of those who reject Faith!

60\. (On the Day of Judgment  
Wilt thou see those  
Who told lies against God;—  
Their faces will be turned  
Black; is there not  
In Hell an abode  
For the Haughty?

61\. But God will deliver  
The righteous to their place  
Of salvation: no evil  
Shall touch them,  
Nor shall they grieve.

62\. God is the Creator  
Of all things, and He  
Is the Guardian and Disposer  
Of all affairs.

63\. To Him belong the keys  
Of the heavens  
And the earth:  
And those who reject  
The Signs of God,—  
It is they who will  
Be in loss.

<span id="page_1256">p. 1256</span>

##### SECTION 7.

64\. Say: "Is it  
Some one other than God  
That ye order me  
To worship, O ye  
Ignorant ones?"

65\. But it has already  
Been revealed to thee,—  
As it was to those  
Before thee,—"If thou  
Wert to join (gods  
With God), truly fruitless  
Will be thy work (in life),  
And thou wilt surely  
Be in the ranks of those  
Who lose (all spiritual good)".

66\. Nay, but worship God,  
And be of those who  
Give thanks.

67\. No just estimate  
Have they made of God,  
Such as is due to Him:  
On the Day of Judgment  
The whole of the earth  
Will be but His handful,  
And the heavens will be

<span id="page_1257">p. 1257</span>

Rolled up in His right hand:  
Glory to Him!  
High is He above  
The Partners they attribute  
To Him!

68\. The Trumpet will (just)  
Be sounded, when all  
That are in the heavens  
And on earth will swoon,  
Except such as it will  
Please God (to exempt).  
Then will a second one  
Be sounded, when, behold,  
They will be standing  
And looking on!

69\. And the Earth will shine  
With the glory of its Lord:  
The Record (of Deeds)  
Will be placed (open);  
The prophets and the witnesses  
Will be brought forward;  
And a just decision  
Pronounced between them;  
And they will not  
Be wronged (in the least).

70\. And to every soul will be  
Paid in full (the fruit)

<span id="page_1258">p. 1258</span>

Of its deeds; and (God)  
Knoweth best all that  
They do.

##### SECTION 8.

71\. The Unbelievers will be  
Led to Hell in crowd:  
Until, when they arrive there,  
Its gates will be opened.  
And its Keepers will say,  
"Did not apostles come  
To you from among yourselves,  
Rehearsing to you the Signs  
Of your Lord, and warning you  
Of the Meeting of this Day  
Of yours?" The answer  
Will be: "True: but  
The Decree of Punishment  
Has been proved true  
Against the Unbelievers!"

72\. (To them) will be said:  
"Enter ye the gates of Hell,  
To dwell therein:  
And evil is (this)  
Abode of the arrogant!"

73\. And those who feared  
Their Lord will be led  
To the Garden in crowds:  
Until behold, they arrive there;

<span id="page_1259">p. 1259</span>

Its gates will be opened;  
And its Keepers will say:  
"Peace be upon you!  
Well have ye done!"  
Enter ye here,  
To dwell therein."

74\. They will say: "Praise be  
To God, Who has  
Truly fulfilled His promise  
To us, and has given us  
(This) land in heritage:  
We can dwell in the Garden  
As we will: how excellent  
A reward for those  
Who work (righteousness)!"

75\. And thou wilt see  
The angels surrounding  
The Throne (Divine)  
On all sides, singing Glory  
And Praise to their Lord.  
The Decision between them  
(At Judgment) will be  
In (perfect) justice,  
And the cry (on all sides)  
Will be, "Praise be to God,  
The Lord of the Worlds!"
