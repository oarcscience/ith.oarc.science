### Sūra LVIII.

### *Mujādila,* or The Woman who Pleads.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. God has indeed  
Heard (and accepted) the statement  
Of the woman who pleads  
With thee concerning her husband  
And carries her complaint  
(In prayer) to God:  
And God (always) hears  
The arguments between both  
Sides among you: for God  
Hears and sees (all things).

2\. If any men among you  
Divorce their wives by  
(Calling them mothers),  
They cannot be their mothers:  
None can be their mothers  
Except those who gave them  
Birth. And in fact  
They use words (both) iniquitous  
And false: but truly  
God is One that blots out

<span id="page_1511">p. 1511</span>

(Sins), and forgives  
(Again and again).

3\. But those who divorce  
Their wives by *Zihār,  
*Then wish to go back  
On the words they uttered,—  
(It is ordained that  
Such a one)  
Should free a slave  
Before they touch each other:  
This are ye admonished  
To perform: and God is  
Well-acquainted with (all)  
That ye do.

4\. And if any has not  
(The wherewithal),  
He should fast for  
Two months consecutively  
Before they touch each other.  
But if any is unable  
To do so, he should feed  
Sixty indigent ones.  
This, that ye may show  
Your faith in God

<span id="page_1512">p. 1512</span>

And His Apostle.  
Those are limits (set  
By) God. For those who  
Reject (Him), there is  
A grievous Penalty.

5\. Those who resist God  
And His Apostle will be  
Humbled to dust, as were  
Those before them: for We  
Have already sent down  
Clear Signs. And the Unbelievers  
(Will have) a humiliating Penalty,—

6\. On the Day that  
God will raise them  
All up (again) and show  
Them the truth (and meaning)  
Of their conduct. God has  
Reckoned its (value), though  
They may have forgotten it,  
For God is Witness  
To all things.

##### SECTION 2.

7\. Seest thou not that  
God doth know (all) that is  
In the heavens and  
On earth? There is not  
A secret consultation  
Between three, but He  
Makes the fourth among them,—  
Nor between five but

<span id="page_1513">p. 1513</span>

He makes the sixth,—  
Nor between fewer nor more,  
But He is in their midst,  
Wheresoever they be:  
In the end will He  
Tell them the truth  
Of their conduct, on the Day  
Of Judgment. For God  
Has full knowledge  
Of all things.

8\. Turnest thou not thy sight  
Towards those who were  
Forbidden secret counsels  
Yet revert to that which  
They were forbidden (to do)?  
And they hold secret counsels  
Among themselves for iniquity  
And hostility, and disobedience  
To the Apostle. And when  
They come to thee,  
They salute thee,  
Not as God salutes thee,  
(But in crooked ways):  
And they say to themselves,  
"Why does not God  
Punish us for our words?"  
Enough for them is Hell:  
In it will they burn,  
And evil is that destination!

9\. O ye who believe!  
When ye hold secret counsel,  
Do it not for iniquity  
And hostility, and disobedience

<span id="page_1514">p. 1514</span>

To the Prophet; but do it  
For righteousness and self-restraint;  
And fear God, to Whom  
Ye shall be brought back.

10\. Secret counsels are only  
(Inspired) by the Evil One,  
In order that he may  
Cause grief to the Believers;  
But he cannot harm them  
In the least, except as  
God permits; and on God  
Let the Believers  
Put their trust.

11\. O ye who believe!  
When ye are told  
To make room  
In the assemblies,  
(Spread out and) make room:  
(Ample) room will God provide  
For you. And when  
Ye are told to rise up,  
Rise up: God will  
Raise up, to (suitable) ranks  
(And degrees), those of you  
Who believe and who have

<span id="page_1515">p. 1515</span>

Been granted (mystic) Knowledge.  
And God is well-acquainted  
With all ye do.

12\. O ye who believe  
When ye consult  
The Apostle in private,  
Spend something in charity  
Before your private consultation.  
That will be best for you,  
And most conducive  
To purity (of conduct).  
But if ye find not  
(The wherewithal), God is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

13\. Is it that ye are  
Afraid of spending sums  
In charity before your  
Private consultation (with him)

<span id="page_1516">p. 1516</span>

If, then, ye do not so,  
And God forgives you,  
Then (at least) establish  
Regular prayer; practise  
Regular charity; and obey  
God and His Apostle.  
And God is well-acquainted  
With all that ye do.

##### SECTION 3.

14\. Turnest thou not  
Thy attention to those  
Who turn (in friendship)  
To such as have the Wrath  
Of God upon them?  
They are neither of you  
Nor of them, and they  
Swear to falsehood knowingly.

15\. God has prepared for them  
A severe Penalty: evil  
Indeed are their deeds.

16\. They have made their oaths  
A screen (for their misdeeds):  
Thus they obstruct (men)  
From the Path of God:  
Therefore shall they have  
A humiliating Penalty.

17\. Of no profit whatever  
To them, against God,  
Will be their riches  
Nor their sons:

<span id="page_1517">p. 1517</span>

They will be Companions  
Of the Fire, to dwell  
Therein (for aye)!

18\. One Day will God  
Raise them all up  
(For Judgment): then  
Will they swear to Him  
As they swear to you:  
And they think that they  
Have something (to stand upon).  
No, indeed! they are  
But liars!

19\. The Evil One has  
Got the better of them:  
So he has made them  
Lose the remembrance  
Of God. They are the Party  
Of the Evil One. Truly,  
It is the Party  
Of the Evil One  
That will perish!

20\. Those who resist  
God and His Apostle  
Will be among those  
Most humiliated.

21\. God has decreed:  
"It is I and My apostles  
Who must prevail":  
For God is One  
Full of strength,  
Able to enforce His Will.

<span id="page_1518">p. 1518</span>

22\. Thou wilt not find  
Any people who believe  
In God and the Last Day,  
Loving those who resist  
God and His Apostle,  
Even though they were  
Their fathers or their sons,  
Or their brothers, or  
Their kindred. For such  
He has written Faiths  
In their hearts, and strengthened  
Them with a spirit  
From Himself. And He  
Will admit them to Gardens  
Beneath which Rivers flow,  
To dwell therein (for ever).  
God will be well pleased  
With them, and they with Him.  
They are the Party  
Of God. Truly it is  
The Party of God that  
Will achieve Felicity.
