### Sūra XCVIII.

### *Baiyina,* or The Clear Evidence.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Those who reject (Truth),  
Among the People of the Book  
And among the Polytheists,  
Were not going to depart  
(From their ways) until  
There should come to them  
Clear Evidence,—

2\. An apostle from God,  
Rehearsing scriptures  
Kept pure and holy:

3\. Wherein are laws (or decrees)  
Right and straight.

4\. Nor did the People  
Of the Book

<span id="page_1768">p. 1768</span>

Make schisms,  
Until after there came  
To them Clear Evidence.

5\. And they have been commanded  
No more than this:  
To worship God,  
Offering Him sincere devotion,  
Being True (in faith);  
To establish regular Prayer;  
And to practise regular Charity;  
And that is the Religion  
Right and Straight.

6\. Those who reject (Truth),  
Among the People of the Book  
And among the Polytheists,  
Will be in hell-fire,  
To dwell therein (for aye).  
They are the worst  
Of creatures.

7\. Those who have faith  
And do righteous deeds,—  
They are the best  
Of creatures.

<span id="page_1769">p. 1769</span>

8\. Their reward is with God:  
Gardens of Eternity,  
Beneath which rivers flow;  
They will dwell therein  
For ever; God well pleased  
With them, and they with Him;  
All this for such as  
Fear their Lord and Cherisher.
