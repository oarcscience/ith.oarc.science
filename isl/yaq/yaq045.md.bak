### Sūra XLV.

### *Ja<u>th</u>iya*, or Bowing the Knee.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Ḥā-Mīm*.

2\. The revelation  
Of the Book  
Is from God  
The Exalted in Power,  
Full of Wisdom.

3\. Verily in the heavens  
And the earth, are Signs  
For those who believe.

4\. And in the creation  
Of yourselves and the fact  
That animals are scattered  
(Through the earth), are Signs  
For those of assured Faith.

5\. And in the alternation  
Of Night and Day,  
And the fact that God  
Sends down Sustenance from  
The sky, and revives therewith  
The earth after its death,

<span id="page_1356">p. 1356</span>

And in the change  
Of the winds,—are Signs  
For those that are wise.

6\. Such are the Signs  
Of God, which We rehearse to thee  
In truth: then in what  
Exposition will they believe  
After (rejecting) God  
And His Signs?

7\. Woe to each sinful  
Dealer in Falsehoods:

8\. He hears the Signs  
Of God rehearsed to him,  
Yet is obstinate and lofty,  
As if he had not  
Heard them: then announce  
To him a Penalty Grievous!

9\. And when he learns  
Something of Our Signs,  
He takes them in jest:  
For such there will be  
A humiliating Penalty.

10\. In front of them is  
Hell: and of no profit  
To them is anything  
They may have earned,  
Nor any protectors they  
May have taken to themselves  
Besides God: for them  
Is a tremendous Penalty.

<span id="page_1357">p. 1357</span>

11\. This is (true) Guidance:  
And for those who reject  
The Signs of their Lord,  
Is a grievous Penalty  
Of abomination.

##### SECTION 2.

12\. It is God Who has  
Subjected the sea to you,  
That ships may sail  
Through it by His command,  
That ye may seek  
Of His Bounty, and that  
Ye may be grateful.

13\. And He has subjected  
To you, as from Him,  
All that is in the heavens  
And on earth: behold,  
In that are Signs indeed  
For those who reflect.

14\. Tell those who believe,  
To forgive those who  
Do not look forward  
To the Days of God:

<span id="page_1358">p. 1358</span>

It is for Him to recompense  
(For good or ill) each People  
According to what  
They have earned.

15\. If any one does  
A righteous deed,  
It enures to the benefit  
Of his own soul;  
If he does evil,  
It works against  
(His own soul).  
In the end will ye  
(All) be brought back  
To your Lord.

16\. We did aforetime  
Grant to the Children  
Of Israel the Book,  
The Power of Command,  
And Prophethood; We gave  
Them, for Sustenance, things  
Good and pure; and We  
Favoured them above the nations.

17\. And We granted them  
Clear Signs in affairs

<span id="page_1359">p. 1359</span>

(Of Religion): it was only  
After knowledge had been  
Granted to them that they  
Fell into schisms, through  
Insolent envy among themselves  
Verily thy Lord will judge  
Between them on the Day  
Of Judgment as to those  
Matters in which they  
Set up differences.

18\. Then we put thee  
On the (right) Way  
Of Religion: so follow  
Thou that (Way),  
And follow not the desires  
Of those who know not.

19\. They will be of no  
Use to thee in the sight  
Of God: it is only  
Wrong-doers (that stand as)  
Protectors, one to another:  
But God is the Protector  
Of the Righteous.

20\. These are clear evidences  
To men, and a Guidance  
And Mercy to those  
Of assured Faith.

<span id="page_1360">p. 1360</span>

21\. What! do those who  
Seek after evil ways  
Think that We shall  
Hold them equal with  
Those who believe and  
Do righteous deeds,—that  
Equal will be their  
Life and their death?  
Ill is the judgment  
That they make.

##### SECTION 3.

22\. God created the heavens  
And the earth for  
Just ends, and in order  
That each soul may find  
The recompense of what  
It has earned, and none  
Of them be wronged.

23\. Then seest thou such  
A one as takes  
As his god his own  
Vain desire? God has,  
Knowing (him as such),  
Left him astray, and sealed  
His hearing and his heart  
(And understanding), and put

<span id="page_1361">p. 1361</span>

A cover on his sight.  
Who, then, will guide him  
After God (has withdrawn  
Guidance)? Will ye not  
Then receive admonition?

24\. And they say: "What is  
There but our life  
In this world?  
We shall die and we live,  
And nothing but Time  
Can destroy us." But  
Of that they have no  
Knowledge: they merely conjecture:

25\. And when Our Clear  
Signs are rehearsed to them,  
Their argument is nothing  
But this: they say, "Bring  
(Back) our forefathers, if  
What ye say is true!"

26\. Say: "It is God Who  
Gives you life, then  
Gives you death; then  
He will gather you together  
For the Day of Judgment  
About which there is  
No doubt": but most  
Men do not understand.

##### SECTION 4.

27\. To God belongs  
The dominion of the heavens  
And the earth, and  
The Day that the Hour

<span id="page_1362">p. 1362</span>

Of Judgment is established,—  
That Day will the dealers  
In Falsehood perish!

28\. And thou wilt see  
Every sect bowing the knee:  
Every sect will be called  
To its Record: "This Day  
Shall ye be recompensed  
For all that ye did!

29\. "This Our Record speaks  
About you with truth:  
For We were wont  
To put on record  
All that ye did."

30\. Then, as to those who  
Believed and did righteous  
Deeds, their Lord will  
Admit them to His Mercy:  
That will be the Achievement's  
For all to see.

31\. But as to those who  
Rejected God, (to them  
Will be said): "Were not  
Our Signs rehearsed to you?  
But ye were arrogant,  
And were a people  
Given to sin!

<span id="page_1363">p. 1363</span>

32\. "And when it was said  
That the promise of God  
Was true, and that the Hour—  
There was no doubt  
About its (coming), ye  
Used to say, "We  
Know not what is  
The Hour: we only think  
It is an idea, and we  
Have no firm assurance."

33\. Then will appear to them  
The evil (fruits) of what  
They did, and they will be  
Completely encircled by that  
Which they used to mock at!

34\. It will also be said:  
"This Day We will forget  
You as ye forgot  
The meeting of this Day  
Of yours! And your  
Abode is the Fire, and  
No helpers have ye!

35\. "This, because ye used  
To take the Signs of God  
In jest, and the life  
Of the world deceived you:  
(From) that Day, therefore,  
They shall not be taken out  
Thence, nor shall they be  
Received into Grace.

<span id="page_1364">p. 1364</span>

36\. Then Praise be to God,  
Lord of the heavens  
And Lord of the earth,—  
Lord and Cherisher  
Of all the worlds!

37\. To Him be Glory  
Throughout the heavens  
And the earth: and He  
Is Exalted in Power,  
Full of Wisdom!
