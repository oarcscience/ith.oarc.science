### Sūra XXIV.

### Nūr, or Light.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. A Sūra which We  
Have sent down and  
Which We have ordained:  
In it have We sent down  
Clear Signs, in order that  
Ye may receive admonition.

2\. The woman and the man  
Guilty of adultery or fornication,—  
Flog each of them  
With a hundred stripes:  
Let not compassion move you  
In their case, in a matter  
Prescribed by God, if ye believe  
In God and the Last Day:  
And let a party  
Of the Believers  
Witness their punishment.

3\. Let no man guilty of  
Adultery or fornication marry  
Any but a woman  
Similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever:  
Nor let any but such a man  
Or an Unbeliever  
Marry such a woman:  
To the Believers such a thing  
Is forbidden.

<span id="page_897">p. 897</span>

4\. And those who launch  
A charge against chaste women,  
And produce not four witnesses  
(To support their allegations),—  
Flog them with eighty stripes;  
And reject their evidence  
Ever after: for such men  
Are wicked transgressors;—

5\. Unless they repent thereafter  
And mend (their conduct);  
For God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

6\. And for those who launch  
A charge against their spouses,  
And have (in support)  
No evidence but their own,—

<span id="page_898">p. 898</span>

Their solitary evidence  
(Can be received) if they  
Bear witness four times  
(With an oath) by God  
That they are solemnly  
Telling the truth;

7\. And the fifth (oath)  
(Should be) that they solemnly  
Invoke the curse of God  
On themselves if they  
Tell a lie.

8\. But it would avert  
The punishment from the wife,  
If she bears witness  
Four times (with an oath)  
By God, that (her husband)  
Is telling a lie;

9\. And the fifth (oath)  
Should be that she solemnly  
Invokes the wrath of God  
On herself if (her accuser)  
Is telling the truth.

10\. If it were not  
For God's grace and mercy  
On you, and that God  
Is Oft-Returning,  
Full of wisdom,  
(Ye would be ruined indeed).

##### SECTION 2.

11\. Those who brought forward  
The lie are a body

<span id="page_899">p. 899</span>

Among yourselves: think it not  
To be an evil to you;  
On the contrary it is good  
For you: to every man  
Among them (will come  
The punishment) of the sin  
That he earned, and to him  
Who took on himself the lead  
Among them, will be  
A Penalty grievous.

12\. Why did not the Believers  
Men and women—when ye  
Heard of the affair,—put  
The best construction on it  
In their own minds  
And say, "This (charge)  
Is an obvious lie"?

13\. Why did they not bring  
Four witnesses to prove it?  
When they have not brought  
The witnesses, such men,  
In the sight of God,  
(Stand forth) themselves as liars!

14\. Were it not for the grace  
And mercy of God on you,  
In this world and the Hereafter,  
A grievous penalty would have  
Seized you in that ye rushed  
Glibly into this affair.

15\. Behold, ye received it  
On your tongues,

<span id="page_900">p. 900</span>

And said out of your mouths  
Things of which ye had  
No knowledge; and ye thought  
It to be a light matter,  
While it was most serious  
In the sight of God.

16\. And why did ye not,  
When ye heard it, say?—  
"It is not right of us  
To speak of this:  
Glory to God! this is  
A most serious slander!"

17\. God doth admonish you,  
That ye may never repeat  
Such (conduct), if ye  
Are (true) Believers.

18\. And God makes the Signs  
Plain to you: for God  
Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

19\. Those who love (to see)  
Scandal published broadcast  
Among the Believers, will have  
A grievous Penalty in this life  
And in the Hereafter: God  
Knows, and ye know not.

20\. Were it not for the grace  
And mercy of God on you,

<span id="page_901">p. 901</span>

And that God is  
Full of kindness and mercy,  
(Ye would be ruined indeed).

##### SECTION 3.

21\. O ye who believe!  
Follow not Satan's footsteps:  
If any will follow the footsteps  
Of Satan, he will (but) command  
What is shameful and wrong:  
And were it not for the grace  
And mercy of God on you.  
Not one of you would ever  
Have been pure: but God  
Doth purify whom He pleases:  
And God is One Who  
Hears and knows (all things).

22\. Let not those among you  
Who are endued with grace  
And amplitude of means  
Resolve by oath against helping  
Their kinsmen, those in want,  
And those who have left

<span id="page_902">p. 902</span>

Their homes in God's cause:  
Let them forgive and overlook,  
Do you not wish  
That God should forgive you?  
For God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

23\. Those who slander chaste women,  
Indiscreet but believing,  
Are cursed in this life  
And in the Hereafter:  
For them is a grievous Penalty,—

24\. On the Day when their tongues,  
Their hands, and their feet  
Will bear witness against them  
As to their actions.

25\. On that Day God  
Will pay them back  
(All) their just dues,  
And they will realise  
That God is  
The (very) Truth,  
That makes all things manifest.

26\. Women impure are for men impure  
And men impure for women impure  
And women of purity  
Are for men of purity,  
And men of purity  
Are for women of purity:  
These are not affected

<span id="page_903">p. 903</span>

By what people say:  
For them there is forgiveness,  
And a provision honourable.

##### SECTION 4.

27\. O ye who believe!  
Enter not houses other than  
Your own, until ye have  
Asked permission and saluted  
Those in them: that is  
Best for you, in order that  
Ye may heed (what is seemly).

28\. If ye find no one  
In the house, enter not  
Until permission is given  
To you: if ye are asked  
To go back, go back:  
That makes for greater purity

<span id="page_904">p. 904</span>

For yourselves: and God  
Knows well all that ye do.

29\. It is no fault on your part  
To enter houses not used  
For living in, which serve  
Some (other) use for you:  
And God has knowledge  
Of what ye reveal  
And what ye conceal.

30\. Say to the believing men  
That they should lower  
Their gaze and guard  
Their modesty: that will make  
For greater purity for them:  
And God is well acquainted  
With all that they do.

31\. And say to the believing women  
That they should lower  
Their gaze and guard  
Their modesty; that they  
Should not display their  
Beauty and ornaments except  
What (must ordinarily) appear  
Thereof; that they should

<span id="page_905">p. 905</span>

Draw their veils over  
Their bosoms and not display  
Their beauty except  
To their husbands, their fathers,  
Their husbands’ fathers, their sons,  
Their husbands’ sons,  
Their brothers or their brothers’ sons,  
Or their sisters’ sons,  
Or their women, or the slaves  
Whom their right hands  
Possess, or male servants  
Free of physical needs,  
Or small children who  
Have no sense of the shame  
Of sex; and that they  
Should not strike their feet  
In order to draw attention  
To their hidden ornaments.  
And O ye Believers!  
Turn ye all together  
Towards God, that ye  
May attain Bliss.

32\. Marry those among you  
Who are single, or  
The virtuous ones among  
Your slaves, male or female:  
If they are in poverty,  
God will give them  
Means out of His grace:  
For God encompasseth all,  
And He knoweth all things.

<span id="page_906">p. 906</span>

33\. Let those who find not  
The wherewithal for marriage  
Keep themselves chaste, until  
God gives them means  
Out of His grace.  
And if any of your slaves  
Ask for a deed in writing  
(To enable them to earn  
Their freedom for a certain sum),  
Give them such a deed  
If ye know any good  
In them; yea, give them  
Something yourselves  
Out of the means which  
God has given to you.  
But force not your maids  
To prostitution when they desire  
Chastity, in order that ye  
May make a gain  
In the goods of this life.  
But if anyone compels them,  
Yet, after such compulsion,  
Is God Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful (to them).

34\. We have already sent down  
To you verses making things  
Clear, an illustration from (the story  
Of) people who passed away  
Before you, and an admonition  
For those who fear (God).

<span id="page_907">p. 907</span>

##### SECTION 5.

35\. God is the Light  
Of the heavens and the earth.  
The parable of His Light  
Is as if there were a Niche  
And within it a Lamp:  
The Lamp enclosed in Glass:

<span id="page_908">p. 908</span>

The glass as it were  
A brilliant star:  
Lit from a blessed Tree,  
An Olive, neither of the East  
Nor of the West,  
Whose Oil is well-nigh  
Luminous,  
Though fire scarce touched it  
Light upon Light!  
God doth guide  
Whom He will  
To His Light:  
God doth set forth Parables  
For men: and God  
Doth know all things.

36\. (Lit is such a Light)  
In houses, which God  
Hath permitted to be raised  
To honour; for the celebration,

<span id="page_909">p. 909</span>

In them, of His name:  
In them is He glorified  
In the mornings and  
In the evenings, (again and again),

37\. By men whom neither  
Traffic nor merchandise  
Can divert from the Remembrance  
Of God, nor from regular Prayer,  
Nor from the practice  
Of regular Charity:  
Their (only) fear is  
For the Day when  
Hearts and eyes  
Will be transformed  
(In a world wholly new),—

38\. That God may reward them  
According to the best  
Of their deeds, and add  
Even more for them  
Out of His Grace:  
For God doth provide  
For those whom He will,  
Without measure.

39\. but the Unbelievers,—  
Their deeds are like a mirage

<span id="page_910">p. 910</span>

In sandy deserts, which  
The man parched with thirst  
Mistakes for water; until  
When he comes up to it,  
He finds it to be nothing:  
But he finds God  
(Ever) with him, and God  
Will pay him his account:  
And God is swift  
In taking account.

40\. Or (the Unbelievers’ state)  
Is like the depths of darkness  
In a vast deep ocean,  
Overwhelmed with billow  
Topped by billow,  
Topped by (dark) clouds:  
Depths of darkness, one  
Above another: if a man  
Stretches out his hand,  
He can hardly see it!  
For any to whom God  
Giveth not light,  
There is no light!

##### SECTION 6.

41\. Seest thou not that it is  
God Whose praises all beings  
In the heavens and on earth  
Do celebrate, and the birds

<span id="page_911">p. 911</span>

(Of the air) with wings  
Outspread? Each one knows  
Its own (mode of) prayer  
And praise. And God  
Knows well all that they do.

42\. Yea, to God belongs  
The dominion of the heavens  
And the earth; and to God  
Is the final goal (of all).

43\. Seest thou not that God  
Makes the clouds move  
Gently, then joins them  
Together, then makes them  
Into a heap?—then wilt thou  
See rain issue forth  
From their midst. And He  
Sends down from the sky  
Mountain masses (of clouds)  
Wherein is hail: He strikes  
Therewith whom He pleases  
And He turns it away  
From whom He pleases.  
The vivid flash of His lightning  
Well-nigh blinds the sight.

44\. It is God Who alternates  
The Night and the Day:

<span id="page_912">p. 912</span>

Verily in these things  
Is an instructive example  
For those who have vision!

45\. And God has created  
Every animal from water: sort  
Of them there are some  
That creep on their bellies;  
Some that walk on two legs;  
And some that walk on four.  
God creates what He wills;  
For verily God has power  
Over all things.

46\. We have indeed sent down  
Signs that make things manifest:  
And God guides whom He wills  
To a Way that is straight.

47\. They say, "We believe  
In God and in the Apostle,  
And we obey": but  
Even after that, some of them  
Turn away: they are not  
(Really) Believers.

48\. When they are summoned  
To God and His Apostle,  
In order that he may judge  
Between them, behold, some  
Of them decline (to come).

<span id="page_913">p. 913</span>

49\. But if the right is  
On their side, they come  
To him with all submission

50\. Is it that there is  
A disease in their hearts  
Or do they doubt,  
Or are they in fear,  
That God and His Apostle  
Will deal unjustly with them?  
Nay, it is they themselves  
Who do wrong.

##### SECTION 7.

51\. The answer of the Believers,  
When summoned to God  
And His Apostle, in order  
That he may judge between them,  
Is no other than this:  
They say, "We hear and we obey":  
It is such as these  
That will attain felicity.

52\. It is such as obey  
God and His Apostle,  
And fear God and do  
Right, that will win  
(In the end).

53\. They swear their strongest oaths  
By God that, if only thou

<span id="page_914">p. 914</span>

Wouldst command them, they  
Would leave (their homes).  
Say: "Swear ye not;  
Obedience is (more) reasonable;  
Verily, God is well acquainted  
With all that ye do."

54\. Say: "Obey God, and obey  
The Apostle: but if ye turn  
Away, he is only responsible  
For the duty placed on him  
And ye for that placed  
On you. If ye obey him,  
Ye shall be on right guidance.  
The Apostle's duty is only  
To preach the clear (Message).

55\. God has promised, to those  
Among you who believe  
And work righteous deeds, that He  
Will, of a surety, grant them  
In the land, inheritance  
(Of power), as He granted it  
To those before them; that  
He will establish in authority  
Their religion—the one  
Which He has chosen for them;  
And that He will change  
(Their state), after the fear  
In which they (lived), to one

<span id="page_915">p. 915</span>

Of security and peace:  
'They will worship Me (alone)  
And not associate aught with Me.'  
If any do reject Faith  
After this, they are  
Rebellious and wicked.

56\. So establish regular Prayer  
And give regular Charity;  
And obey the Apostle;  
That ye may receive mercy.

57\. Never think thou  
That the Unbelievers  
Are going to frustrate  
(God's Plan) on earth:  
Their abode is the Fire,—  
And it is indeed  
An evil refuge!

##### SECTION 8.

58\. O ye who believe!  
Let those whom your right hands  
Possess, and the (children) among you

<span id="page_916">p. 916</span>

Who have not come of age  
Ask your permission (before  
They come to your presence),  
On three occasions: before  
Morning prayer; the while  
Ye doff your clothes  
For the noonday heat;  
And after the late-night prayer:  
These are your three times  
Of undress: outside those times  
It is not wrong for you  
Or for them to move about  
Attending to each other:  
Thus does God make clear  
The Signs to you: for God  
Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

59\. But when the children among you  
Come of age, let them (also)  
Ask for permission, as do those  
Senior to them (in age):  
Thus does God make clear  
His Signs to you: for God  
Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

60\. Such elderly women as are  
Past the prospect of marriage,—  
There is no blame on them  
If they lay aside

<span id="page_917">p. 917</span>

Their (outer) garments, provided  
They make not a wanton display  
Of their beauty: but  
It is best for them  
To be modest: and God  
Is One Who sees and knows  
All things.

61\. It is no fault in the blind  
Nor in one born lame, nor  
In one afflicted with illness,  
Nor in yourselves, that ye  
Should eat in your own houses,  
Or those of your fathers,  
Or your mothers, or your brothers,  
Or your sisters, or your father's brothers  
Or your father's sisters,  
Or your mother's brothers,  
Or your mother's sisters,  
Or in houses of which  
The keys are in your possession,  
Or in the house of a sincere  
Friend of yours: there is  
No blame on you, whether  
Ye eat in company or  
Separately. But if ye  
Enter houses, salute each other—  
A greeting of blessing  
And purity as from God.

<span id="page_918">p. 918</span>

Thus does God make clear  
The Signs to you: that ye  
May understand.

##### SECTION 9.

62\. Only those are Believers,  
Who believe in God and  
His Apostle: when they are  
With him on a matter  
Requiring [collective](errata.htm#5) action,  
They do not depart until  
They have asked for his leave;  
Those who ask for thy leave  
Are those who believe in God  
And His Apostle; so when  
They ask for thy leave,  
For some business of theirs,  
Give leave to those of them  
Whom thou wilt, and ask  
God for their forgiveness:  
For God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

63\. Deem not the summons  
Of the Apostle among yourselves  
Like the summons of one  
Of you to another: God  
Doth know those of you  
Who slip away under shelter  
Of some excuse: then  
Let those beware who

<span id="page_919">p. 919</span>

Withstand the Apostle's order,  
Lest some trial befall them,  
Or a grievous Penalty  
Be inflicted on them.

64\. Be quite sure that  
To God doth belong  
Whatever is in the heavens  
And on earth. Well doth He  
Know what ye are intent upon:  
And one day they will be  
Brought back to Him, and He  
Will tell them the truth  
Of what they did:  
For God doth know  
All things.
