### Sūra XIX.

### *Maryam,* or Mary.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Kāf. Hā. Yā. ‘Ain Ṣād.*

2\. (This is) a recital  
Of the Mercy of thy Lord  
To His servant Zakarīya.

3\. Behold! he cried  
To his Lord in secret,

4\. Praying: "O my Lord!  
Infirm indeed are my bones,  
And the hair of my head  
Doth glisten with grey:  
But never am I unblest,  
O my Lord, in my prayer  
To Thee!

<span id="page_768">p. 768</span>

5\. "Now I fear (what)  
My relatives (and colleagues)  
(Will do) after me:  
But my wife is barren:  
So give me an heir  
As from Thyself,—

6\. "(One that) will (truly)  
"Represent me, and represent  
The posterity of Jacob;  
And make him, O my Lord!  
One with whom Thou art  
Well-pleased!"

7\. (His prayer was answered):

"O Zakarīya! We give thee  
Good news of a son:  
His name shall be Yaḥyā:  
On none by that name  
Have We conferred distinction before."

8\. He said: "O my Lord!  
How shall I have a son,  
When my wife is barren  
And I have grown quite decrepit  
From old age?"

<span id="page_769">p. 769</span>

9\. He said: "So (it will be):  
Thy Lord saith, "That is  
Easy for Me: I did  
Indeed create thee before,  
When thou hadst been nothing!"

10\. (Zakarīya) said: "O my Lord!  
Give me a Sign."  
"Thy Sign," was the answer,  
"Shall be that thou  
Shalt speak to no man  
For three nights,  
Although thou art not dumb."

11\. So Zakarīya came out  
To his people  
From his chamber:  
He told them by signs  
To celebrate God's praises  
In the morning  
And in the evening.

12\. (To his son came the command):  
"O Yaḥyā! take hold

<span id="page_770">p. 770</span>

Of the Book with might":  
And We gave him Wisdom  
Even as a youth,

13\. And pity (for all creatures)  
As from us, and purity:  
He was devout,

14\. And kind to his parents,  
And he was not overbearing  
Or rebellious.

15\. So Peace on him  
The day he was born,  
The day that he dies,  
And the day that he  
Will be raised up  
To life (again)

<span id="page_771">p. 771</span>

##### SECTION 2.

16\. Relate in the Book  
(The story of) Mary,  
When she withdrew  
From her family  
To a place in the East.

17\. She placed a screen  
(To screen herself) from them;  
Then We sent to her  
Our angel, and he appeared  
Before her as a man  
In all respects.

18\. She said: "I seek refuge  
From thee to (God)  
Most Gracious: (come not near)  
If thou dost fear God."

19\. He said: "Nay, I am only  
A messenger from thy Lord,  
(To announce) to thee  
The gift of a holy son."

20\. She said: "How shall I  
Have a son, seeing that  
No man has touched me,  
And I am not unchaste?"

21\. He said: "So (it will be):  
Thy Lord saith, "That is  
Easy for Me: and (We  
Wish) to appoint him  
As a Sign unto men  
And a Mercy from Us":

<span id="page_772">p. 772</span>

It is a matter  
(So) decreed."

22\. So she conceived him,  
And she retired with him  
To a remote place.

23\. And the pains of childbirth  
Drove her to the trunk  
Of a palm-tree:  
She cried (in her anguish):  
"Ah! would that I had  
Died before this! would that  
I had been a thing  
Forgotten and out of sight!"

24\. But (a voice) cried to her  
From beneath the (palm-tree):  
"Grieve not! for thy Lord  
Hath provided a rivulet  
Beneath thee;

25\. "And shake towards thyself  
The trunk of the palm-tree:  
It will let fall  
Fresh ripe dates upon thee

26\. "So eat and drink  
And cool (thine) eye.  
And if thou dost see  
Any man, say, 'I have

<span id="page_773">p. 773</span>

Vowed a fast to (God)  
Most Gracious, and this day  
Will I enter into no talk  
With any human being'"

27\. At length she brought  
The (babe) to her people,  
Carrying him (in her arms).  
They said: "O Mary!  
Truly an amazing thing  
Hast thou brought!

28\. "O sister of Aaron!  
Thy father was not  
A man of evil, nor thy  
Mother a woman unchaste!"

29\. But she pointed to the babe.  
They said: "How can we  
Talk to one who is  
A child in the cradle?"

30\. He said: "I am indeed  
A servant of God:  
He hath given me  
Revelation and made me  
A prophet;

31\. "And He hath made me  
Blessed wheresoever I be,

<span id="page_774">p. 774</span>

And hath enjoined on me  
Prayer and Charity as long  
As I live;

32\. "(He) hath made me kind  
To my mother, and not  
Overbearing or miserable;

33\. "So Peace is on me  
The day I was born,  
The day that I die,  
And the day that I  
Shall be raised up  
To life (again)"!

34\. Such (was) Jesus the son  
Of Mary: (it is) a statement  
Of truth, about which  
They (vainly) dispute.

35\. It is not befitting  
To (the majesty of) God  
That He should beget  
A son. Glory be to Him!  
When He determines  
A matter, He only says  
To it, "Be", and it is.

36\. Verily God is my Lord  
And your Lord: Him

<span id="page_775">p. 775</span>

Therefore serve ye: this is  
A Way that is straight.

37\. But the sects differ  
Among themselves: and woe  
To the Unbelievers because  
Of the (coming) Judgment  
Of a momentous Day!

38\. How plainly will they see  
And hear, the Day that  
They will appear before Us!  
But the unjust to-day  
Are in error manifest!

39\. But warn them of the Day  
Of Distress, when  
The matter will be determined:  
For (behold,) they are negligent  
And they do not believe!

40\. It is We Who will inherit  
The earth, and all beings  
Thereon: to Us will they  
All be returned.

<span id="page_776">p. 776</span>

##### SECTION 3.

41\. (Also) mention in the Book  
(The story of) Abraham:  
He was a man of Truth,  
A prophet.

42\. Behold, he said to his father:  
"O my father! why  
Worship that which heareth not  
And seeth not, and can  
Profit thee nothing?

43\. "O my father! to me  
Hath come knowledge which  
Hath not reached thee:  
So follow me: I will guide  
Thee to a Way that  
Is even and straight.

44\. "O my father! serve not  
Satan: for Satan is  
A rebel against (God)  
Most Gracious

45\. "O my father! I fear  
Lest a Penalty afflict thee  
From (God) Most Gracious,  
So that thou become  
To Satan a friend."

<span id="page_777">p. 777</span>

46\. (The father) replied: "Dost thou  
Hate my gods, O Abraham?  
If thou forbear not, I will  
Indeed stone thee:  
Now get away from me  
For a good long while!"

47\. Abraham said: "Peace be  
On thee: I will pray  
To my Lord for thy  
forgiveness:  
For He is to me  
Most Gracious.

48\. "And I will turn away  
From you (all) and from those  
Whom ye invoke besides God:  
I will call on my Lord:  
Perhaps, by my prayer to my Lord,  
I shall be not unblest."

49\. When he had turned away  
From them and from those  
Whom they worshipped besides  
God, We bestowed on him  
Isaac and Jacob, and each one  
Of them We made a prophet.

<span id="page_778">p. 778</span>

50\. And We bestowed  
Of Our Mercy on them,  
And We granted them  
Lofty honour on the tongue  
Of truth.

##### SECTION 4.

51\. Also mention in the Book  
(The story of) Moses:  
For he was specially chosen,  
And he was an apostle  
(And) a prophet.

52\. And We called him  
From the right side  
Of Mount (Sinai), and made  
Him draw near to Us,  
For mystic (converse).

53\. And, out of Our Mercy,  
We gave him his brother  
Aaron, (also.) a prophet.

<span id="page_779">p. 779</span>

54\. Also mention in the Book  
(The story of) Ismā‘īl  
He was (strictly) true  
To what he promised,  
And he was an apostle  
(And) a prophet.

55\. He used to enjoin  
On his people Prayer  
And Charity, and he was  
Most acceptable in the sight  
Of his Lord.

56\. Also mention in the Book  
The case of Idrīs  
He was a man of truth  
(And sincerity), (and) a prophet:

57\. And We raised him  
To a lofty station.

58\. Those were some  
Of the prophets on whom  
God did bestow His Grace,—  
Of the posterity of Adam,  
And of those whom We  
Carried (in the Ark)  
With Noah, and of  
The posterity of Abraham  
And Israel—of those  
Whom We guided and chose.

<span id="page_780">p. 780</span>

Whenever the Signs  
Of (God) Most Gracious  
Were rehearsed to them,  
They would fall down  
In prostrate adoration  
And in tears.

59\. But after them there followed  
A posterity who missed  
Prayers and followed after lusts  
Soon, then, will they  
Face Destruction,—

60\. Except those who repent  
And believe, and work  
Righteousness: for these  
Will enter the Garden  
And will not be wronged  
In the least,—

61\. Gardens of Eternity, those  
Which (God) Most Gracious  
Has promised to His servants  
In the Unseen: for His promise  
Must (necessarily) come to pass.

62\. They will not there hear  
Any vain discourse, but  
Only salutations of Peace:  
And they will have therein  
Their sustenance, morning  
And evening.

<span id="page_781">p. 781</span>

63\. Such is the Garden which  
We give as an inheritance  
To those of Our servants  
Who guard against evil.

64\. (The angels say:)  
"We descend not but  
By command of thy Lord:  
To Him belongeth what is  
Before us and what is  
Behind us, and what is  
Between: and thy Lord  
Never doth forget,—

65\. "Lord of the heavens  
And of the earth,  
And of all that is  
Between them: so worship Him,  
And be constant and patient  
In His worship: knowest thou  
Of any who is worthy  
Of the same Name as He?"

##### SECTION 5.

66\. Man says: "What!  
When I am dead, shall I  
Then be raised up alive?"

<span id="page_782">p. 782</span>

67\. But does not man  
Call to mind that We  
Created him before  
Out of nothing?

68\. So, by thy Lord,  
Without doubt, We shall gather  
Them together, and (also)  
The Evil Ones (with them);  
Then shall We bring them  
Forth on their knees  
Round about Hell;

69\. Then shall We certainly  
Drag out from every sect  
All those who were worst  
In obstinate rebellion  
Against (God) Most Gracious.

70\. And certainly We know best  
Those who are most worthy  
Of being burned therein.

71\. Not one of you but will  
Pass over it: this is,  
With thy Lord, a Decree  
Which must be accomplished.

72\. But We shall save those  
Who guarded against evil,  
And We shall leave  
The wrong-doers therein,  
(Humbled) to their knees.

<span id="page_783">p. 783</span>

73\. When Our Clear Signs  
Are rehearsed to them,  
The Unbelievers say to those  
Who believe, "Which of the two  
Sides is best in point of  
Position? which makes the best  
Show in Council?"

74\. But how many (countless)  
Generations before them  
Have We destroyed,  
Who were even better  
In equipment and in glitter  
To the eye?

75\. Say: "If any men go  
Astray, (God) Most Gracious  
Extends (the rope) to them,  
Until, when they see  
The warning of God (being  
Fulfilled)—either in punishment  
Or in (the approach of)  
The Hour,—they will  
At length realise who is  
Worst in position, and (who)  
Weakest in forces!

76\. "And God doth advance  
In guidance those who seek  
Guidance: and the things  
That endure, Good Deeds,  
Are best in the sight  
Of thy Lord, as rewards,  
And best in respect of  
(Their) eventual returns."

<span id="page_784">p. 784</span>

77\. Hast thou then seen  
The (sort of) man who  
Rejects Our Signs, yet  
Says: "I shall certainly  
Be given wealth and children?"

78\. Has he penetrated to  
The Unseen, or has he  
Taken a contract with  
(God) Most Gracious?

79\. Nay! We shall record  
What he says, and We  
Shall add and add  
To his punishment.

80\. To Us shall return  
All that he talks of,  
And he shall appear  
Before Us bare and alone.

81\. And they have taken  
(For worship) gods other than  
God, to give them  
Power and glory!

82\. Instead, they shall reject  
Their worship, and become  
Adversaries against them.

<span id="page_785">p. 785</span>

##### SECTION 6.

83\. Seest thou not that We  
Have set the Evil Ones on  
Against the Unbelievers,  
To incite them with fury?

84\. So make no haste  
Against them, for We  
But count out to them  
A (limited) number (of days).

85\. The day We shall gather  
The righteous to (God)  
Most Gracious, like a hand  
Presented before a king for honours,

86\. And We shall drive  
The sinners to hell,  
Like thirsty cattle  
Driven down to water,—

87\. None shall have the power  
Of intercession, but such a one  
As has received permission (or promise)  
From (God) Most Gracious.

88\. They say: "(God) Most Gracious  
Has begotten a son!"

89\. Indeed ye have put forth  
A thing most monstrous!

<span id="page_786">p. 786</span>

90\. At it the skies are ready  
To burst, the earth  
To split asunder, and  
The mountains to fall down  
In utter ruin,

91\. That they should invoke  
A son for (God) Most Gracious.

92\. For it is not consonant  
With the majesty of (God)  
Most Gracious that He  
Should beget a son.

93\. Not one of the beings  
In the heavens and the earth  
But must come to (God)  
Most Gracious as a servant.

94\. He does take an account  
Of them (all), and hath  
Numbered them (all) exactly.

95\. And everyone of them  
Will come to Him singly  
On the Day of Judgment.

96\. On those who believe  
And work deeds of righteousness,  
Will (God) Most Gracious  
Bestow Love.

97\. So have We made  
The (Qur-ān) easy  
In thine own tongue,  
That with it thou mayest give

<span id="page_787">p. 787</span>

Glad tidings to the righteous,  
And warnings to people  
Given to contention.

98\. But how many (countless)  
Generations before them  
Have We destroyed? Canst thou  
Find a single one of them  
(Now) or hear. (so much  
As) a whisper of them?
