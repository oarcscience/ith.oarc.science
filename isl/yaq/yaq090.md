### Sūra XC.

### *Balad,* or The City.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. I do call to witness  
This City;—

2\. And thou art a freeman  
Of this City;—

3\. And (the mystic ties  
of) Parent and Child;—

4\. Verily We have created  
Man into toil and struggle.

5\. Thinketh he, that none  
Hath power over him?

<span id="page_1738">p. 1738</span>

6\. He may say (boastfully):  
"Wealth have I squandered  
In abundance!"

7\. Thinketh he that none  
Beholdeth him?

8\. Have We not made  
For him a pair of eyes?—

9\. And a tongue,  
And a pair of lips?—

10\. And shown him  
The two highways?

11\. But he hath made no haste  
On the path that is steep.

12\. And what will explain  
To thee the path that is steep?—

<span id="page_1739">p. 1739</span>

13\. (It is:) freeing the bondman;

14\. Or the giving of food  
In a day of privation

15\. To the orphan  
With claims of relationship,

16\. Or to the indigent  
(Down) in the dust.

17\. Then will he be  
Of those who believe,  
And enjoin patience, (constancy,  
And self-restraint), and enjoin  
Deeds of kindness and compassion.

18\. Such are the Companions  
Of the Right Hand.

<span id="page_1740">p. 1740</span>

19\. But those who reject  
Our Signs, they are  
The (unhappy) Companions  
Of the Left Hand.

20\. On them will be Fire  
Vaulted over (all round).
