### Sūra VIII.

### Anfāl, or the Spoils of War.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. They ask thee concerning  
(Things taken as) spoils of war.  
Say: "(Such) spoils are  
At the disposal of God  
And the Apostle: so fear  
God, and keep straight  
The relations between yourselves:  
Obey God and His Apostle,  
If ye do believe."

2\. For, Believers are those  
Who, when God is mentioned,  
Feel a tremor in their hearts,  
And when they hear  
His Signs rehearsed, find  
Their faith strengthened,  
And put (all) their trust  
In their Lord;

3\. Who establish regular prayers  
And spend (freely) out of  
The gifts We have given  
Them for sustenance:

4\. Such in truth are the Believers:  
They have grades of dignity  
With their Lord, and forgiveness,  
And generous sustenance:

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

5\. Just as thy Lord ordered thee  
Out of thy house in truth,  
Even though a party among  
The Believers disliked it,

6\. Disputing with thee concerning  
The truth after it was made  
Manifest, as if they were  
Being driven to death  
And they (actually) saw it.

7\. Behold! God promised you  
One of the two (enemy) parties,  
That it should be yours:  
Ye wished that the one  
Unarmed should be yours,  
But God willed  
To justify the Truth  
According to His words,  
And to cut off the roots  
Of the Unbelievers;—

8\. That He might justify Truth  
And prove Falsehood false,  
Distasteful though it be  
To those in guilt.

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

9\. Remember ye implored  
The assistance of your Lord,  
And He answered you:  
"I will assist you  
With a thousand of the angels,  
Ranks on ranks."

10\. God made it but a message  
Of hope, and an assurance  
To your hearts: (in any case)  
There is no help.  
Except from God:  
And God is Exalted in Power,  
Wise.

##### SECTION 2.

11\. Remember He covered you  
With a sort of drowsiness,  
To give you calm as from  
Himself, and he caused  
Rain to descend on you  
From heaven, to clean you  
Therewith, to remove from you  
The stain of Satan,  
To strengthen your hearts,  
And to plant your feet  
Firmly therewith.

12\. Remember thy Lord inspired  
The angels (with the message):  
"I am with you: give  
Firmness to the Believers:

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

I will instil terror  
Into the hearts of the Unbelievers:  
Smite ye above their necks  
And smite all their  
Finger-tips off them.

13\. This because they contended  
Against God and His Apostle:  
If any contend against God  
And His Apostle, God  
Is strict in punishment.

14\. Thus (will it be said): "Taste ye  
Then of the (punishment):  
For those who resist God,  
Is the penalty of the Fire."

15\. O ye who believe!  
When ye meet  
The Unbelievers  
In hostile array,  
Never turn your backs  
To them.

16\. If any do turn his back  
To them on such a day—  
Unless it be in a stratagem  
Of war, or to retreat  
To a troop (of his own)—  
He draws on himself  
The wrath of God,  
And his abode is Hell,—  
An evil refuge (indeed)!

17\. It is not ye who  
Slew them; it was God:

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

When thou threwest (a handful  
Of dust), it was not  
Thy act, but God's:  
In order that He might  
Test the Believers  
By a gracious trial  
From Himself: for God  
Is He Who heareth  
And knoweth (all things).

18\. That, and also because  
God is He Who makes feeble  
The plans and stratagems  
Of the Unbelievers.

19\. (O Unbelievers!) if ye prayed  
For victory and judgment,  
Now hath the judgment  
Come to you: if ye desist  
(From wrong), it will be  
Best for you: if ye return  
(To the attack), so shall We.  
Not the least good  
Will your forces be to you  
Even if they were multiplied:  
For verily God  
Is with those who believe!

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

##### SECTION 3.

20\. O ye who believe!  
Obey God and His Apostle,  
And turn not away from him  
When ye hear (him speak).

21\. Nor be like those who say,  
"We hear," but listen not:

22\. For the worst of beasts  
In the sight of God  
Are the deaf and the dumb,—  
Those who understand not.

23\. If God had found in them  
Any good, He would indeed  
Have made them listen:  
(As it is), if He had made them  
Listen, they would but have  
Turned back and declined (faith).

24\. O ye who believe!  
Give your response to God  
And His Apostle, when He  
Calleth you to that which  
Will give you life;  
And know that God  
Cometh in between a man  
And his heart, and that  
It is He to Whom  
Ye shall (all) be gathered.

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

25\. And fear tumult or oppression,  
Which affecteth not in particular  
(Only) those of you who do wrong:  
And know that God  
Is strict in punishment.

26\. Call to mind when ye  
Were a small (band),  
Despised through the land,  
And afraid that men might  
Despoil and kidnap you;  
But He provided a safe asylum  
For you, strengthened you  
With His aid, and gave you  
Good things for sustenance:  
That ye might be grateful.

27\. O ye that believe!  
Betray not the trust  
Of God and the Apostle,  
Nor misappropriate knowingly  
Things entrusted to you.

28\. And know ye  
That your possessions

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

And your progeny  
Are but a trial;  
And that it is God  
With whom lies  
Your highest reward.

##### SECTION 4

29\. O ye who believe!  
If ye fear God,  
He will grant you a Criterion  
(To judge between right and wrong),  
Remove from you (all) evil  
(That may afflict) you,  
And forgive you:  
For God is the Lord  
Of grace unbounded.

30\. Remember how the Unbelievers  
Plotted against thee, to keep  
Thee in bonds, or slay thee,  
Or get thee out (of thy home).  
They plot and plan,  
And God too plans,  
But the best of planners  
Is God.

31\. When Our Signs are rehearsed  
To them, they say: "We  
Have heard this (before):  
If we wished, we could  
Say (words) like these:  
These are nothing  
But tales of the ancients."

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

32\. Remember how they said:  
"O God! if this is indeed  
The Truth from Thee,  
Rain down on as a shower  
Of stones from the sky,  
Or send us a grievous Penalty.

33\. But God was not going  
To send them a Penalty  
Whilst thou wast amongst them;  
Nor was He going to send it  
Whilst they could ask for pardon

34\. But what plea have they  
That God should not punish  
Them, when they keep out  
(Men) from the Sacred Mosque—  
And they are not its guardians?  
No men can be its guardians  
Except the righteous; but most  
Of them do not understand.

35\. Their prayer at the House  
(Of God) is nothing but  
Whistling and clapping of hands:  
(Its only answer can be),  
"Taste ye the Penalty  
Because ye blasphemed."

36\. The Unbelievers spend their wealth  
To hinder (men) from the path  
Of God, and so will they  
Continue to spend; but  
In the end they will have  
(Only) regrets and sighs;

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

At length they will be overcome:  
And the Unbelievers will be  
Gathered together to Hell;—

37\. In order that God may separate  
The impure from the pure,  
Put the impure, one on another,  
Heap them together, and cast them  
Into Hell. They will be  
The ones to have lost.

##### SECTION 5.

38\. Say to the Unbelievers,  
If (now) they desist (from Unbelief),  
Their past would be forgiven them;  
But if they persist, the punishment  
Of those before them is already  
(A matter of warning for them).

39\. And fight them on  
Until there is no [more](errata.htm#2.md)  
Tumult or oppression,  
And there prevail  
Justice and faith in God  
Altogether and everywhere;  
But if they cease, verily God  
Doth see all that they do.

40\. If they refuse, be sure  
That God is your Protector—  
The Best to protect  
And the Best to help.

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

41\. And know that out of  
All the booty that ye  
May acquire (in war),  
A fifth share is assigned  
To God,—and to the Apostle,  
And to near relatives,  
Orphans, the needy,  
And the wayfarer,  
If ye do believe in God  
And in the revelation  
We sent down to Our Servant  
On the Day of Testing,—  
The Day of the meeting  
Of the two forces.  
For God hath power  
Over all things.

42\. Remember ye were  
On the hither side  
Of the valley, and they  
On the farther side,  
And the caravan  
On lower ground than ye.  
Even if ye had made  
A mutual appointment  
To meet, ye would certainly:  
Have failed in the appointment:

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

But (thus ye met),  
That God might accomplish  
A matter already enacted;  
That those who died might  
Die after a clear Sign  
(Had been given), and those who lived  
Might live after a Clear Sign  
(Had been given). And verily  
God is He who heareth  
And knoweth (all things).

43\. Remember in thy dream  
God showed them to thee  
As few: if He had shown  
Them to thee as many,  
Ye would surely have been  
Discouraged, and ye would  
Surely have disputed  
In (your) decision: but God  
Saved (you): for He knoweth  
Well the (secrets) of (all) hearts.

44\. And remember when ye met,  
He showed them to you  
As few in your eyes,  
And He made you appear  
As contemptible in their eyes:  
That God might accomplish  
A matter already enacted.  
For to God do all questions  
Go back (for decision).

##### SECTION 6.

45\. O ye who believe!  
When ye meet a force,  
Be firm, and call God  
In remembrance much (and often);  
That ye may prosper:

46\. And obey God and His Apostle;  
And fall into no disputes,

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

Lest ye lose heart  
And your power depart;  
And be patient and persevering:  
For God is with those  
Who patiently persevere:

47\. And be not like those  
Who started from their homes  
Insolently and to be seen of men,  
And to hinder (men)  
From the path of God:  
For God compasseth round about  
All that they do.

48\. Remember Satan made  
Their (sinful) acts seem  
Alluring to them, and said:  
"No one among men  
Can overcome you this day,  
While I am near to you":  
But when the two forces  
Came in sight of each other,  
He turned on his heels,  
And said: "Lo! I am clear  
Of you; to! I see  
What ye see not;  
Lo! I fear God; for God  
Is strict in punishment.

##### SECTION 7.

49\. Lo! the Hypocrites say, and those  
In whose hearts is a disease:  
"These people,—their religion  
Has misled them." But  
If any trust in God, behold!  
God is Exalted in might, Wise.

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

50\. If thou couldst see,  
When the angels take the souls  
Of the Unbelievers (at death),  
(How) they smite their faces  
And their backs, (saying):  
"Taste the Penalty of the blazing Fire—

51\. "Because of (the deeds) which  
Your (own) hands sent forth:  
For God is never unjust  
To His servants:

52\. "(Deeds) after the manner  
Of the People of Pharaoh  
And of those before them:  
They rejected the Signs of God,  
And God punished them  
For their crimes: for God  
Is Strong, and Strict in punishment:

53\. "Because God will never change  
The Grace which He hath bestowed  
On a people until they change  
What is in their (own) souls:  
And verily God is He  
Who heareth and knoweth (all things)."

54\. "(Deeds) after the manner  
Of the People of Pharaoh  
And those before them":  
They treated as false the Signs  
Of their Lord: so We

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

Destroyed them for their crimes,  
And We drowned the People  
Of Pharaoh: for they were all  
Oppressors and wrong-doers.

55\. For the worst of beasts  
In the sight of God  
Are those who reject Him:  
They will not believe.

56\. They are those with whom  
Thou didst make a covenant,  
But they break their covenant  
Every time, and they have not  
The fear (of God).

57\. If ye gain the mastery  
Over them in war,  
Disperse, with them, those  
Who follow them,  
That they may remember.

58\. If thou fearest treachery  
From any group, throw back  
(Their Covenant) to them, (so as  
To be) on equal terms:  
For God loveth not the treacherous.

##### SECTION 8.

59\. Let not the Unbelievers  
Think that they can  
Get the better (of the godly):  
They will never frustrate (them).

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

60\. Against them make ready  
Your strength to the utmost  
Of your power, including  
Steeds of war, to strike terror  
Into (the hearts of) the enemies,  
Of God and your enemies,  
And others besides, whom  
Ye may not know, but whom  
God doth know. Whatever  
Ye shall spend in the Cause  
Of God, shall be repaid  
Unto you, and ye shall not  
Be treated unjustly.

61\. But if the enemy  
Incline towards peace,  
Do thou (also) incline  
Towards peace, and trust  
In God: for He is the One  
That heareth and knoweth  
(All things).

62\. Should they intend  
To deceive thee,—verily God  
Sufficeth thee: He it is  
That hath strengthened thee  
With his aid and  
With (the company of)  
The Believers;

63\. And (moreover) He hath put  
Affection between their hearts:

<span id="page_431">p. 431</span>

Not if thou hadst spent  
All that is in the earth,  
Couldst thou have produced  
That affection, but God  
Hath done it: for He  
Is Exalted in might, Wise.

64\. O Apostle! Sufficient  
Unto thee is God,—  
(Unto thee) and unto those  
Who follow thee  
Among the Believers.

##### SECTION 9.

65\. O Apostle! rouse the Believers  
To the fight. If there are  
Twenty amongst you, patient  
And persevering, they will  
Vanquish two hundred: if a hundred,  
They will vanquish a thousand  
Of the Unbelievers: for these  
Are a people without understanding.

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

66\. For the present, God  
Hath lightened your (task),  
For He knoweth that there is  
A weak spot in you:  
But (even so), if there are  
A hundred of you, patient  
And persevering, they will  
Vanquish two hundred, and if  
A thousand, they will vanquish  
Two thousand, with the leave  
Of God: for God is with those  
Who patiently persevere.

67\. It is not fitting  
For an Apostle  
That he should have  
Prisoners of war until  
He hath thoroughly subdued  
The land. Ye look  
For the temporal goods  
Of this world; but God  
Looketh to the Hereafter:  
And God is Exalted in might, Wise.

68\. Had it not been for  
A previous ordainment

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

From God, a severe penalty  
Would have reached you  
For the (ransom) that ye took.

69\. But (now) enjoy what ye took  
In war, lawful and good:  
But fear God: for God  
Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 10.

70, O Apostle! say to those  
Who are captives in your hands:  
"If God findeth any good  
In your hearts, He will  
Give you something better  
Than what has been taken  
From you, and He will  
Forgive you: for God  
Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful."

71\. But if they have  
Treacherous designs against thee,  
(O Apostle!), they have already  
Been in treason against God,  
And so hath He given  
(Thee) power over them.  
And God is He who hath  
(Full) knowledge and wisdom.

72\. Those who believed,  
And adopted exile,

<span id="page_434">p. 434</span>

And fought for the Faith,  
With their property  
And their persons,  
In the cause of God,  
As well as those  
Who gave (them) asylum  
And aid,—these are (all)  
Friends and protectors,  
One of another.  
As to those who believed  
But came not into exile,  
Ye owe no duty  
Of protection to them  
Until they come into exile;  
But if they seek  
Your aid in religion,  
It is your duty  
To help them,  
Except against a people  
With whom ye have  
A treaty of mutual alliance.  
And (remember) God  
Seeth all that ye do.

73\. The Unbelievers are  
Protectors, one of another:  
Unless ye do this,  
(Protect each other),  
There would be  
Tumult and oppression  
On earth, and great mischief.

<span id="page_435">p. 435</span>

74\. Those who believe,  
And adopt exile,  
And tight for the Faith,  
In the cause of God,  
As well as those  
Who give (them) asylum  
And aid,—these are (all)  
In very truth the Believers:  
For them is the forgiveness  
Of sins and a provision  
Most generous.

75\. And those who  
Accept Faith subsequently,  
And adopt exile,  
And fight for the Faith  
In your company,  
They are of you.  
But kindred by blood  
Have prior rights  
Against each other  
In the Book of God.  
Verily God is well-acquainted  
With all things.
