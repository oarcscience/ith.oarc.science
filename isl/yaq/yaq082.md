### Sūra LXXXII.

### *Infiṭār,* or The Cleaving Asunder.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. When the Sky  
Is cleft asunder;

2\. When the Stars  
Are scattered;

3\. When the Oceans  
Are suffered to burst forth;

4\. And when the Graves  
Are turned upside down;—

<span id="page_1700">p. 1700</span>

5\. (Then) shall each soul know  
What it hath sent forward  
And (what it hath) kept back.

6\. O man! what has  
Seduced thee from  
Thy Lord Most Beneficent?—

7\. Him Who created thee.  
Fashioned thee in due proportion  
And gave thee a just bias;

8\. In whatever Form He wills,  
Does He put thee together.

9\. Nay! but ye do  
Reject Right and Judgment!

10\. But verily over you  
(Are appointed angels)  
To protect you,—

11\. Kind and honourable,—  
Writing down (your deeds):

<span id="page_1701">p. 1701</span>

12\. They know (and understand)  
All that ye do.

13\. As for the Righteous,  
They will be in Bliss;

14\. And the Wicked—  
They will be in the Fire,

15\. Which they will enter  
On the Day of Judgment,

16\. And they will not be  
Able to keep away therefrom.

17\. And what will explain  
To thee what the Day  
Of Judgment is?

18\. Again, what will explain  
To thee what the Day  
Of Judgment is?

19\. (It will be) the Day  
When no soul shall have  
Power (to do) aught  
For another  
For the Command, that Day,  
Will be (wholly) with God.
