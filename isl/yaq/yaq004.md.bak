### Sūra IV.

### Nisāa, or The Women.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious  
Most Merciful*.

1\. O mankind! reverence  
Your Guardian-Lord,  
Who created you  
From a single Person,  
Created, of like nature,  
His mate, and from them twain  
Scattered (like seeds)  
Countless men and women;—  
Reverence God, through Whom  
Ye demand your mutual (rights),  
And (reverence) the wombs  
(That bore you): for God  
Ever watches over you.

2\. To orphans restore their property  
(When they reach their age),  
Nor substitute (your) worthless things  
For (their) good ones; and devour not  
Their substance (by mixing it up)

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

With your own. For this is  
I ndeed a great sin.

3\. If ye fear that ye shall not  
Be able to deal justly  
With the orphans,  
Marry women of your choice,  
Two, or three, or four;  
But if ye fear that ye shall not  
Be able to deal justly (with them),  
Then only one, or (a captive)  
That your right hands possess.  
That will be more suitable,  
To prevent you  
From doing injustice.

4\. And give the women  
(On marriage) their dower  
As a free gift; but if they,  
Of their own good pleasure,  
Remit any part of it to you,  
Take it and enjoy it  
With right good cheer.

5\. To those weak of understanding  
Make not over your property,  
Which God hath made  
A means of support for you,  
But feed and clothe them  
Therewith, and speak to them  
Words of kindness and justice.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

6\. Make trial of orphans  
Until they reach the age  
Of marriage; if then ye find  
Sound judgment in them,  
Release their property to them;  
But consume it not wastefully,  
Nor in haste against their growing up.  
If the guardian is well-off,  
Let him claim no remuneration,  
But if he is poor, let him  
Have for himself what is  
Just and reasonable.  
When ye release their property  
To them, take witnesses  
In their presence:  
But all-sufficient  
Is God in taking account.

7\. From what is left by parents  
And those nearest relateds,  
There is a share for men  
And a share for women,  
Whether the property be small  
Or large,—a determinate share.

8\. But if at the time of division  
Other relatives, or orphans,  
Or poor, are present,  
Feed them out of the (property),  
And speak to them  
Words of kindness and justice.

9\. Let those (disposing of an estate)  
Have the same fear in their minds  
As they would have for their own  
If they had left a helpless family behind:  
Let them fear God, and speak  
Words of appropriate (comfort),

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

10\. Those who unjustly  
Eat up the property  
Of orphans, eat up  
A Fire into their own  
Bodies: they will soon  
Be enduring a blazing Fire!

##### SECTION 2.

11\. God (thus) directs you  
As regards your children's  
(Inheritance): to the male,  
A portion equal to that  
Of two females: if only  
Daughters, two or more,  
Their share is two-thirds  
Of the inheritance;  
If only one, her share  
Is a half.

For parents, a sixth share  
Of the inheritance to each,  
If the deceased left children;  
If no children, and the parents  
Are the (only) heirs, the mother  
Has a third; if the deceased  
Left brothers (or sisters)  
The mother has a sixth.  
(The distribution in all cases  
Is) after the payment  
Of legacies and debts.  
Ye know not whether  
Your parents or your children  
Are nearest to you  
In benefit. These are  
Settled portions ordained

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

By God; and God is  
All-knowing, All-wise.

12\. In what your wives leave,  
Your share is a half,  
1f they leave no child;  
But if they leave a child,  
Ye get a fourth; after payment  
Of legacies and debts.  
In what ye leave,  
Their share is a fourth,  
If ye leave no child;  
But if ye leave a child,  
They get an eighth; after payment  
Of legacies and debts.

If the man or woman  
Whose inheritance is in question,  
Has left neither ascendants nor descendants,  
But has left a brother  
Or a sister, each one of the two  
Gets a sixth; but if more  
Than two, they share in a third;  
After payment of legacies  
And debts; so that no loss  
Is caused (to any one).  
Thus is it ordained by God;  
And God is All-knowing,  
Most Forbearing.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

13\. Those are limits  
Set by God: those who  
Obey God and His Apostle  
Will be admitted to Gardens  
With rivers flowing beneath,  
To abide therein (for ever)  
And that will be  
The Supreme achievement.

14\. But those who disobey  
God and His Apostle  
And transgress His limits  
Will be admitted  
To a Fire, to abide therein:  
And they shall have  
A humiliating punishment.

##### SECTION 3.

15\. If any of your women  
Are guilty of lewdness,  
Take the evidence of four  
(Reliable) witnesses from amongst you  
Against them; and if they testify,  
Confine them to houses until  
Death do claim them,

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

Or God ordain for them  
Some (other) way.

16\. If two men among you  
Are guilty of lewdness,  
Punish them both.  
If they repent and amend,  
Leave them alone; for God  
Is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.

17\. God accepts the repentance  
Of those who do evil  
In ignorance and repent  
Soon afterwards; to them  
Will God turn in mercy:  
For God is full of knowledge  
And wisdom.

18\. Of no effect is the repentance  
Of those who continue  
To do evil, until Death  
Faces one of them, and he says,  
"Now have I repented indeed;"  
Nor of those who die  
Rejecting Faith: for them  
Have we prepared  
A punishment most grievous.

19\. O ye who believe!  
Ye are forbidden to inherit  
Women against their will.  
Nor should ye treat them

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

With harshness, that ye may  
Take away part of the dower  
Ye have given them,—except  
Where they have been guilty  
Of open lewdness;  
On the contrary live with them  
On a footing of kindness and equity.  
If ye take a dislike to them  
It may be that ye dislike  
A thing, and God brings about  
Through it a great deal of good.

20\. But if ye decide to take  
One wife in place of another,  
Even if ye had given the latter  
A whole treasure for dower,  
Take not the least bit of it back:  
Would ye take it by slander  
And a manifest wrong?

21\. And how could ye take it  
When ye have gone in  
Unto each other, and they have  
Taken from you a solemn covenant?

22\. And marry not women  
Whom your fathers married,—  
Except what is past:  
It was shameful and odious,—  
An abominable custom indeed.

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

##### SECTION 4.

23\. Prohibited to you  
(For marriage) are:—  
Your mothers, daughters,  
Sisters; father's sisters,  
Mother's sisters; brother's daughters,  
Sister's daugters; foster-mothers  
(Who gave you suck), foster-sisters;  
Your wives’ mothers;  
Your step-daughters under your  
Guardianship, born of your wives  
To whom ye have gone in,  
No prohibition if ye have not gone in;—  
(Those who have been)  
Wives of your sons proceeding  
From your loins;  
And two sisters in wedlock  
At one and the same time,  
Except for what is past;  
For God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful;—

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

24\. Also (prohibited are)  
Women already married,  
Except those  
Whom your right hands possess:  
Thus hath God ordained  
(Prohibitions) against you:  
Except for these, all others  
Are lawful, provided  
Ye seek (them in marriage)  
With gifts from your property,—  
Desiring chastity, not lust.  
Seeing that ye derive  
Benefit from them, give them  
Their dowers (at least)  
As prescribed; but if,  
After a dower is prescribed, ye agree  
Mutually (to vary it),  
There is no blame on you,  
And God is All-knowing  
All-wise.

25\. If any of you have not  
The means wherewith  
To wed free believing women,  
They may wed believing  
Girls from among those  
Whom your right hands possess:  
God hath full knowledge  
About your Faith.  
Ye are one from another:  
Wed them with the leave  
Of their owners, and give them  
Their dowers, according to what

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

Is reasonable: they should be  
Chaste, not lustful, nor taking  
Paramours: when they  
Are taken in wedlock,  
If they fall into shame,  
Their punishment is half  
That for free women.  
This (permission) is for those  
Among you who fear sin;  
But it is better for you  
That ye practise self-restraint.  
And God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 5.

26\. God doth wish  
To make clear to you  
And to show you  
The ordinances of those  
Before you; and (He  
Doth wish to) turn to you  
(In Mercy): and God  
Is All-knowing, All-wise.

27\. God doth wish  
To turn to you,  
But the wish of those  
Who follow their lusts  
Is that ye should turn  
Away (from Him),  
Far, far away.

28\. God doth wish  
To lighten your (difficulties);  
For man was created  
Weak (in flesh).

29\. O ye who believe! sot  
Eat not up your property

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

Among yourselves in vanities:  
But let there be amongst you  
Traffic and trade  
By mutual good-will:  
Nor kill (or destroy)  
Yourselves: for verily  
God hath been to you  
Most Merciful!

30\. If any do that  
In rancour and injustice,—  
Soon shall We cast them  
Into the Fire: and easy  
It is for God.

31\. If ye (but) eschew  
The most heinous  
Of the things  
Which ye are forbidden to do,  
We shall expel  
Out of you  
All the evil in you,  
And admit you to a Gate  
Of great honour.

32\. And in no wise covet  
Those things in which God  
Hath bestowed His gifts  
More freely on some of you  
Than on others: to men  
Is allotted what they earn,  
And to women what they earn:  
But ask God of His bounty.  
For God hath full knowledge  
Of all things.

33\. To (benefit) every one,  
We have appointed  
Sharers and heirs  
To property left

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

By parents and relatives.  
To those, also, to whom  
Your right hand was pledged,  
Give their due portion.  
For truly God is witness  
To all things.

##### SECTION 6.

34\. Men are the protectors  
And maintainers of women,  
Because God has given  
The one more (strength)  
Than the other, and because  
They support them  
From their means.  
Therefore the righteous women  
Are devoutly obedient, and guard  
In (the husband's) absence  
What God would have them guard.  
As to those women  
On whose part ye fear  
Disloyalty and ill-conduct,  
Admonish them (first),  
(Next), refuse to share their beds,  
(And last) beat them (lightly);  
But if they return to obedience,  
Seek not against them  
Means (of annoyance):

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

For God is Most High,  
Great (above you all).

35\. If ye fear a breach  
Between them twain,  
Appoint (two) arbiters,  
One from his family,  
And the other from hers;  
If they wish for peace,  
God will cause  
Their reconciliation:  
For God hath full knowledge,  
And is acquainted  
With all things.

36\. serve God, and join not  
Any partners with Him;  
And do good  
To parents, kinsfolk,  
Orphans, those in need,  
Neighbours who are near,  
Neighbours who are strangers,  
The Companion by your side,  
The way-farer (ye meet),  
And what your right hands possess:  
For God loveth not  
The arrogant, the vainglorious;—

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

37\. (Nor) those who are niggardly  
Or enjoin niggardliness on others,  
Or hide the bounties  
Which God hath bestowed  
On them; for We have prepared,  
For those who resist Faith,  
A Punishment that steeps  
Them in contempt;—

38\. Not those who spend  
Of their substance, to be seen  
Of men, but have no faith  
In God and the Last Day:  
If any take the Evil One  
For their intimate,  
What a dreadful intimate he is!

39\. And what burden  
Were it on them if they  
Had faith in God  
And in the Last Day,  
And they spent  
Out of what God hath  
Given them for sustenance?  
For God hath full  
Knowledge of them.

40\. God is never unjust  
In the least degree:  
If there is any good (done),  
He doubleth it,  
And giveth from His own  
Presence a great reward.

41\. How then if We brought  
From each People a witness,

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

And We brought thee  
As a witness against  
These People!

42\. On that day  
Those who reject Faith  
And disobey the Apostle  
Will wish that the earth  
Were made one with them:  
But never will they hide  
A single fact from God!

##### SECTION 7.

43\. O ye who believe!  
Approach not prayers  
With a mind befogged,  
Until ye can understand  
All that ye say,  
Nor in a state  
Of ceremonial impurity  
(Except when travelling on the road),  
Until after washing  
Your whole body.  
If ye are ill,  
Or on a journey,  
Or one of you cometh  
From offices of nature,

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

Or ye have been  
In contact with women,  
And ye find no water,  
Then take for yourselves  
Clean sand or earth,  
And rub therewith  
Your faces and hands.  
For God doth blot out sins  
And forgive again and again.

44\. Hast thou not turned  
Thy vision to those  
Who were given a portion  
Of the Book? They traffic  
In error, and wish that ye  
Should lose the right path.

45\. But God hath full knowledge  
Of your enemies:  
God is enough for a Protector,  
And God is enough for a Helper.

46\. Of the Jews there are those  
Who displace words  
From their (right) places,  
And say: "We hear  
And we disobey";  
And "Hear what is not  
Heard"; and "Rā’inā";—  
With a twist of their tongues  
And a slander to Faith.  
If only they had said:  
"We hear and we obey;  
And "Do hear";

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

And "Do look at us":  
It would have been better  
For them, and more proper;  
But God hath cursed them  
For their Unbelief; and but few  
Of them will believe.

47\. O ye People of the Book!  
Believe in what We  
Have (now) revealed, confirming  
What was (already) with you,  
Before We change the face and fame  
Of some (of you) beyond all recognition,  
And turn them hindwards,  
Or curse them as We cursed  
The Sabbath-breakers,  
For the decision of God  
Must be carried out.

48\. God forgiveth not  
That partners should be set up  
With Him; but He forgiveth  
Anything else, to whom  
He pleaseth; to set up  
Partners with God  
Is to devise a sin  
Most heinous indeed.

49\. Hast thou not turned  
Thy vision to those  
Who claim sanctity  
For themselves?

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

Nay—but God  
Doth sanctify  
Whom He pleaseth.  
But never will they  
Fail to receive justice  
In the least little thing.

50\. Behold! how they invent  
A lie against God!  
But that by itself  
Is a manifest sin!

##### SECTION 8.

51\. Hast thou not turned  
Thy vision to those  
Who were given a portion  
Of the Book? They believe  
In Sorcery and Evil,  
And say to the Unbelievers  
That they are better guided  
In the (right) way  
Than the Believers!

52\. They are (men) whom  
God hath cursed:  
And those whom God  
Hath cursed, thou wilt find,  
Have no one to help.

53\. Have they a share  
In dominion or power?  
Behold, they give not a farthing  
To their fellow-men?

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

54\. Or do they envy mankind  
For what God hath given them  
Of his bounty? But We  
Had already given the people  
Of Abraham the Book  
And Wisdom, and conferred  
Upon them a great kingdom.

55\. Some of them believed,  
And some of them averted  
Their faces from him: and enough  
Is Hell for a burning fire.

56\. Those who reject  
Our Signs, We shall soon  
Cast into the Fire:  
As often as their skins  
Are roasted through,  
We shall change them  
For fresh skins,  
That they may taste  
The Penalty: for God  
Is Exalted in Power, Wise.

57\. But those who believe  
And do deeds of righteousness,  
We shall soon admit to Gardens,  
With rivers flowing beneath,—  
Their eternal home:  
Therein shall they have  
Companions pure and holy: ye  
We shall admit them  
To shades, cool and ever deepening.

58\. God doth command you  
To render back your Trusts  
To those to whom they are due;  
And when ye judge

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

Between man and man,  
That ye judge with justice:  
Verily how excellent  
Is the teaching which He giveth you!  
For God is He Who heareth  
And seeth all things.

59\. O ye who believe!  
Obey God, and obey the Apostle,  
And those charged  
With authority among you.  
If ye differ in anything  
Among yourselves, refer it  
To God and His Apostle,  
If ye do believe in God  
And the Last Day:  
That is best, and most suitable  
For final determination.

##### SECTION 9.

60\. Hast thou not turned  
Thy vision to those  
Who declare that they believe  
In the revelations  
That have come to thee  
And to those before thee?  
Their (real) wish is  
To resort together for judgment  
(In their disputes)  
To the Evil One,  
Though they were ordered  
To reject him.  
But Satan's wish  
Is to lead them astray  
Far away (from the Right).

61\. When it is said to them:  
"Come to what God hath revealed,

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

And to the Apostle":  
Thou seest the Hypocrites avert  
Their faces from thee in disgust.

62\. How then, when they are  
Seized by misfortune,  
Because of the deeds  
Which their hands have sent forth?  
Then they come to thee,  
Swearing by God:  
"We meant no more  
Than good-will and conciliation!"

63\. Those men,—God knows  
What is in their hearts;  
So keep clear of them,ss:  
But admonish them,  
And speak to them a word  
To reach their very souls.

64\. We sent not an Apostle,  
But to be obeyed, in accordance  
With the Will of God.  
If they had only,  
When they were unjust  
To themselves,  
Come unto thee  
And asked God's forgiveness,  
And the Apostle had asked  
Forgiveness for them,  
They would have found  
God indeed Oft-returning,  
Most Merciful.

65\. But no, by thy Lord,  
They can have  
No (real) Faith,  
Until they make thee judge  
In all disputes between them,  
And find in their souls  
No resistance against  
Thy decisions, but accept  
Them with the fullest conviction.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

66\. If We had ordered them  
To sacrifice their lives  
Or to leave their homes,  
Very few of them  
Would have done it:  
But if they had done  
What they were (actually) told,  
It would have been best  
For them, and would have gone  
Farthest to strengthen their (faith);

67\. And We should then have  
Given them from Our Presence  
A great reward;

68\. And We should have  
Shown them the Straight Way.

69\. All who obey God  
And the Apostle  
Are in the company  
Of those on whom  
Is the Grace of God,—  
Of the Prophets (who teach),  
The Sincere (lovers of Truth),  
The Witnesses (who testify),  
And the Righteous (who do good):  
Ah! what a beautiful Fellowship!

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

70\. Such is the Bounty  
From God: and sufficient  
Is it that God knoweth all.

##### SECTION 10.

71\. O ye who believe!  
Take your precautions,  
And either go forth in parties  
Or go forth all together.

72\. There are certainly among you  
Men who would tarry behind:  
If a misfortune befalls you,  
They say: "God did favour us  
In that we were not  
Present among them."

73\. But if good fortune comes to you  
From God, they would be sure  
To say—as if there had never been  
Ties of affection between you and them—

"Oh! I wish I had been with them;  
A fine thing should I then  
Have made of it!"

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

74\. Let those fight  
In the cause of God  
Who sell the life of this world  
For the Hereafter.  
To him who fighteth  
In the cause of God,—  
Whether he is slain  
Or gets victory  
Soon shall We give him  
A reward of great (value).

75\. And why should ye not  
Fight in the cause of God  
And of those who, being weak,  
Are ill-treated (and oppressed)?—  
Men, women, and children,  
Whose cry is: "Our Lord!  
Rescue us from this town,  
Whose people are oppressors;  
And raise for us from Thee  
One who will protect;  
And raise for us from Thee  
One who will help!"

76\. Those who believe  
Fight in the cause of God,  
And those who reject Faith  
Fight in the cause of Evil:  
So fight ye against the  
Friends of Satan: feeble indeed  
Is the cunning of Satan.

##### SECTION 11.

77\. Hast thou not turned  
Thy vision to those

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

Who were told to hold back  
Their hands (from fight)  
But establish regular prayers  
And spend in regular Charity?  
When (at length) the order  
For fighting was issued to them,  
Behold! a section of them  
Feared men as  
Or even more than  
They should have feared God:  
They said: "Our Lord!  
Why hast Thou ordered us  
To fight? Wouldst Thou not  
Grant us respite  
To our (natural) term,  
Near (enough)?" Say: "Short  
Is the enjoyment of this world:  
The Hereafter is the best  
For those who do right:  
Never will ye be  
Dealt with unjustly  
In the very least!

78\. "Wherever ye are,  
Death will find you out,  
Even if ye are in towers  
Built up strong and high!"

If some good befalls them,  
They say, "This is from God";  
But if evil, they say,  
"This is from thee" (O Prophet).

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

Say: "All things are from God."  
But what hath come  
To these people,  
That they fail  
To understand  
A single fact?

79\. Whatever good, (O man!)  
Happens to thee, is from God;  
But whatever evil happens  
To thee, is from thy (own) soul.  
And We have sent thee  
As an Apostle  
To (instruct) mankind.  
And enough is God  
For a witness.

80 He who obeys  
The Apostle, obeys God:  
But if any turn away,  
We have not sent thee  
To watch over  
Their (evil deeds).

81\. They have "Obedience"  
On their lips; but  
When they leave thee,  
A section of them  
Meditate all night  
On things very different  
From what thou tellest them.  
But God records  
Their nightly (plots):  
So keep clear of them,  
And put thy trust in God,  
And enough is God

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

As a disposer of affairs.

82\. Do they not consider  
The Qur-ān (with care)?  
Had it been from other  
Than God, they would surely  
Have found therein  
Much discrepancy.

83\. When there comes to them  
Some matter touching  
(Public) safety or fear,  
They divulge it.  
If they had only referred it  
To the Apostle, or to those  
Charged with authority  
Among them, the proper  
Investigators would have  
Tested it from them (direct).  
Were it not for the Grace  
And Mercy of God unto you,  
All but a few of you  
Would have fallen  
Into the clutches of Satan.

84\. Then fight in God's cause—  
Thou art held responsible  
Only for thyself—  
And rouse the Believers.  
It may be that God  
Will restrain the fury

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

Of the Unbelievers;  
For God is the strongest  
In might and in punishment.

85\. Whoever recommends  
And helps a good cause  
Becomes a partner therein:  
And whoever recommends  
And helps an evil cause,  
Shares in its burden:  
And God hath power  
Over all things.

86\. When a (courteous) greeting  
Is offered you, meet it  
With a greeting still more  
Courteous, or (at least)  
Of equal courtesy.  
God takes careful account  
Of all things.

87\. God! There is no god  
But He: of a surety  
He will gather you together  
Against the Day of Judgment,  
About which there is no doubt.  
And whose word can be  
Truer than God's?

##### SECTION 12.

88\. Why should ye be  
Divided into two parties

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

About the Hypocrites?  
God hath upset them  
For their (evil) deeds.  
Would ye guide those  
Whom God hath thrown  
Out of the Way? For those  
Whom God hath thrown  
Out of the Way, never  
Shalt thou find the Way.

89\. They but wish that ye  
Should reject Faith,  
As they do, and thus be  
On the same footing (as they):  
But take not friends  
From their ranks  
Until they flee  
In the way of God  
(From what is forbidden).  
But if they turn renegades,  
Seize them and slay them  
Wherever ye find them;  
And (in any case) take  
No friends or helpers  
From their ranks:—

90\. Except those who join  
A group between whom  
And you there is a treaty

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

(Of peace), or those who approach  
You with hearts restraining  
Them from fighting you  
As well as fighting their own  
People. If God had pleased,  
He could have given them  
Power over you, and they  
Would have fought you:  
Therefore if they withdraw  
From you but fight you not,  
And (instead) send you  
(Guarantees of) peace, then God  
Hath opened no way  
For you (to war against them).

91\. Others you will find  
That wish to gain  
Your confidence as well  
As that of their people:  
Every time they are sent back  
To temptation, they succumb  
Thereto: if they withdraw not  
From you nor give you (guarantees)  
Of peace besides  
Restraining their hands,  
Seize them and slay them  
Wherever ye get them:  
In their case  
We have provided you  
With a clear argument  
Against them.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

##### SECTION 13.

92\. Never should a Believer  
Kill a Believer; but  
(If it so happens) by mistake,  
(Compensation is due):  
If one (so) kills a Believer,  
It is ordained that he  
Should free a believing slave,  
And pay compensation  
To the deceased's family,  
Unless they remit it freely.  
If the deceased belonged  
To a people at war with you,  
And he was a Believer,  
The freeing of a believing slave  
(Is enough). If he belonged  
To a people with whom  
Ye have a treaty of mutual  
Alliance, compensation should  
Be paid to his family,  
And a believing slave be freed.  
For those who find this  
Beyond their means, (is prescribed)  
A fast for two months  
Running: by way of repentance  
To God: for God hath  
All knowledge and all wisdom.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

93.1f a man kills a Believer  
Intentionally, his recompense  
Is Hell, to abide therein  
(For ever): and the wrath  
And the curse of God  
Are upon him, and  
A dreadful penalty  
Is prepared for him.

94\. O ye who believe!  
When ye go abroad  
In the cause of God,  
Investigate carefully,  
And say not to any one  
Who offers you a salutation:  
"Thou art none of a Believer!"  
Coveting the perishable goods  
Of this life: with God  
Are profits and spoils abundant.  
Even thus were ye yourselves  
Before, till God conferred  
On you His favours: therefore  
Carefully investigate.  
For God is well aware  
Of all that ye do.

95\. Not equal are those  
Believers who sit (at home)  
And receive no hurt,  
And those who strive  
And fight in the cause  
Of God with their goods  
And their persons.  
God hath granted  
A grade higher to those  
Who strive and fight

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

With their goods and persons  
Than to those who sit (at home).  
Unto all (in Faith)  
Hath God promised good:  
But those who strive and fight  
Hath He distinguished  
Above those who sit (at home)  
By a special reward,—

96\. Ranks specially bestowed  
By Him. And Forgiveness  
And Mercy. For God is  
Oft forgiving, Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 14.

97\. When angels take  
The souls of those  
Who die in sin  
Against their souls,  
They say: "In what (plight)  
Were ye?" They reply:  
"Weak and oppressed  
Were we in the earth."  
They say: "Was not  
The earth of God  
Spacious enough for you  
To move yourselves away  
(From evil)?" Such men  
Will find their abode  
In Hell,—What an evil  
Refuge!—

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

98\. Except those who are  
(Really) weak and oppressed—  
Men, women, and children—  
Who have no means  
In their power, nor (a guide-post)  
To direct their way.

99\. For these, there is hope  
That God will forgive:  
For God doth blot out (sins)  
And forgive again and again.

100\. He who forsakes his home  
In the cause of God,  
Finds in the earth  
Many a refuge,  
Wide and spacious:  
Should he die  
As a refugee from home  
For God and His Apostle,  
His reward becomes due  
And sure with God:  
And God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 15.

101\. When ye travel  
Through the earth,  
There is no blame on you  
If ye shorten your prayers,  
For fear the Unbelievers  
May attack you:  
For the Unbelievers are  
Unto you open enemies.

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

102\. When thou (O Apostle)  
Art with them, and standest  
To lead them in prayer,  
Let one party of them  
Stand up (in prayer) with thee,  
Taking their arms with them:  
When they finish  
Their prostrations, let them  
Take their position in the rear.  
And let the other party come up  
Which hath not yet prayed—  
And let them pray with thee,  
Taking all precautions,  
And bearing arms:  
The Unbelievers wish,  
If ye were negligent  
Of your arms and your baggage,  
To assault you in a single rush.  
But there is no blame on you  
If ye put away your arms  
Because of the inconvenience  
Of rain or because ye are ill;  
But take (every) precaution  
For yourselves. For the  
Unbelievers  
God hath prepared  
A humiliating punishment.

103\. When ye pass  
(Congregational) prayers,  
Celebrate God's praises,  
Standing, sitting down,  
Or lying down on your sides;  
But when ye are free  
From danger, set up  
Regular Prayers:  
For such prayers  
Are enjoined on Believers  
At stated times.

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

104\. And slacken not  
In following up the enemy:  
If ye are suffering hardships,  
They are suffering similar  
Hardships; but ye have  
Hope from God, while they  
Have none. And God  
Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

##### SECTION 16.

105\. We have sent down  
To thee the Book in truth,  
That thou might test judge  
Between men, as guided  
By God: so be not (used)  
As an advocate by those  
Who betray their trust;

106\. But seek the forgiveness  
Of God; for God is  
Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

107\. Contend not on behalf  
Of such as betray  
Their own souls;  
For God loveth not  
One given to perfidy  
And crime;

108\. They may hide  
(Their crimes) from men,  
But they cannot hide  
(Them) from God, seeing that  
He is in their midst  
When they plot by night,  
In words that He cannot  
Approve: and God  
Doth compass round  
All that they do.

109\. Ah! these are the sort  
Of men on whose behalf  
Ye may contend in this world;  
But who will contend with God  
On their behalf on the Day  
Of Judgment, or who  
Will carry their affairs through?

110\. If any one does evil  
Or wrongs his own soul  
But afterwards seeks  
God's forgiveness, he will find  
God Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

111\. And if any one earns  
Sin, he earns it against

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

His own soul: for God  
Is full of knowledge and wisdom.

112\. But if any one earns  
A fault or a sin  
And throws it on to one  
That is innocent,  
He carries (on himself)  
(Both) a falsehood  
And a flagrant sin.

##### SECTION 17.

113\. But for the Grace of God  
To thee and His Mercy,  
A party of them would  
Certainly have plotted  
To lead thee astray.  
But (in fact) they will only  
Lead their own souls astray,  
And to thee they can do  
No harm in the least.  
For God hath sent down  
To thee the Book and Wisdom  
And taught thee what thou  
Knewest not (before):  
And great is the Grace  
Of God unto thee.

114\. In most of their secret talks  
There is no good: but if  
One exhorts to a deed  
Of charity or justice  
Or conciliation between men,  
(Secrecy is permissible):  
To him who does this,  
Seeking the good pleasure  
Of God, We shall soon give  
A reward of the highest (value).

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

115\. If anyone contends with  
The Apostle even after  
Guidance has been plainly  
Conveyed to him, and follows  
A path other than that  
Becoming to men of Faith,  
We shall leave him  
In the path he has chosen,  
And land him in Hell,—  
What an evil refuge!

##### SECTION 18.

116\. God forgiveth not  
(The sin of) joining other gods  
With Him; but He forgiveth  
Whom He pleaseth other sins  
Than this: one who joins  
Other gods with God,  
Hath strayed far, far away  
(From the Right).

117\. (The Pagans), leaving Him,  
Call but upon female deities:  
They call but upon Satan  
The persistent rebel!

118\. God did curse him,  
But he said: "I will take  
Of Thy servants a portion  
Marked off;

119\. "I will mislead them,  
And I will create

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

In them false desires; I will  
Order them to slit the ears  
Of cattle, and to deface  
The (fair) nature created  
By God." Whoever,  
Forsaking God, takes Satan  
For a friend, hath  
Of a surety suffered  
A loss that is manifest.

120\. Satan makes them promises,  
And creates in them false desires;  
But Satan's promises  
Are nothing but deception.

121\. They (his dupes)  
Will have their dwelling  
In Hell, and from it  
They will find no way  
Of escape.

122\. But those who believe  
And do deeds of righteousness,—  
We shall soon admit them  
To Gardens, with rivers  
Flowing beneath,—to dwell  
Therein for ever.  
God's promise is the truth,  
And whose word can be  
Truer than God's?

123\. Not your desires, nor those  
Of the People of the Book

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

(Can prevail): whoever  
Works evil, will be  
Requited accordingly.  
Nor will he find, besides God,  
Any protector or helper.

124\. If any do deeds  
Of righteousness,  
Be they male or female—  
And have faith,  
They will enter Heaven,  
And not the least injustice  
Will be done to them.

125\. Who can be better  
In religion than one  
Who submits his whole self  
To God, does good,  
And follows the way  
Of Abraham the true in faith?  
For God did take  
Abraham for a friend.

126\. But to God belong all things  
In the heavens and on earth:  
And He it is that  
Encompasseth all things.

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

##### SECTION 19.

127\. They ask thy instruction  
Concerning the Women  
Say: God doth  
Instruct you about them:  
And (remember) what hath  
Been rehearsed unto you  
In the Book, concerning  
The orphans of women to whom  
Ye give not the portions  
Prescribed, and yet whom ye  
Desire to marry, as also  
Concerning the children  
Who are weak and oppressed:  
That ye stand firm  
For justice to orphans.  
There is not a good deed  
Which ye do, but God  
Is well-acquainted therewith.

128\. If a wife fears  
Cruelty or desertion  
On her husband's part,  
There is no blame on them  
If they arrange  
An amicable settlement  
Between themselves;  
And such settlement is best;

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

Even though men's souls  
Are swayed by greed.  
But if ye do good  
And practise self-restraint,  
God is well-acquainted  
With all that ye do.

129\. Ye are never able  
To be fair and just  
As between women,  
Even if it is  
Your ardent desire:  
But turn not away  
(From a woman) altogether,  
So as to leave her (as it were)  
Hanging (in the air).  
If ye come to a friendly  
Understanding, and practise  
Self-restraint, God is  
Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

130\. But if they disagree  
(And must part), God  
Will provide abundance  
For all from His  
All-reaching bounty:  
For God is He  
That careth for all  
And is Wise.

131\. To God belong all things  
In the heavens and on earth.

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

Verily We have directed  
The People of the Book  
Before you, and you (O Muslims).  
To fear God. But if ye  
Deny Him, to! unto God  
Belong all things  
In the heavens and on earth,  
And God is free  
Of all wants, worthy  
Of all praise.

132\. Yea, unto God belong  
All things in the heavens  
And on earth, and enough  
Is God to carry through  
All affairs.

133\. If it were His Will,  
He could destroy you,  
O mankind, and create  
Another race; for He  
Hath power this to do.

134\. If any one desires  
A reward in this life,  
In God's (gift) is the reward  
(Both) of this life  
And of the Hereafter:  
For God is He that heareth  
And seeth (all things).

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

##### SECTION 20.

135\. O ye who believe!  
Stand out firmly  
For justice, as witnesses  
To God, even as against  
Yourselves, or your parents,  
Or your kin, and whether  
It be (against) rich or poor:  
For God can best protect both.  
Follow not the lusts  
(Of your hearts), lest ye  
Swerve, and if ye  
Distort (justice) or decline  
To do justice, verily  
God is well-acquainted  
With all that ye do.

136\. O ye who believe!  
Believe in God  
And His Apostle,  
And the scripture which He  
Hath sent to His Apostle  
And the scripture which He sent  
To those before (him)  
Any who denieth God,  
His angels, His Books,  
His Apostles, and the Day  
Of Judgment, hath gone  
Far, far astray.

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

137\. Those who believe,  
Then reject Faith,  
Then believe (again)  
And (again) reject Faith,  
And go on increasing  
In Unbelief,—God  
Will not forgive them  
Nor guide them on the Way.

138\. To the Hypocrites give  
The glad tidings that  
There is for them  
(But) a grievous Penalty;—

139\. Yea, to those who take  
For friends Unbelievers  
Rather than Believers:  
Is it honour they seek  
Among them? Nay,—  
All honour is with God.

140\. Already has He sent you  
Word in the Book, that when  
Ye hear the Signs of God  
Held in defiance and ridicule,  
Ye are not to sit with them  
Unless they turn to a different  
Theme: if ye did, ye would be  
Like them. For God will  
Collect the Hypocrites and those  
Who defy Faith—all in Hell;—

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

141\. (These are) the ones who  
Wait and watch about you:  
If ye do gain  
A victory from God,  
They say: "Were we not  
With you?"—but if  
The Unbelievers gain  
A success, they say  
(To them): "Did we not  
Gain an advantage over you,  
And did we not guard  
You from the Believers?"  
But God will judge  
Betwixt you on the Day  
Of Judgment. And never  
Will God grant  
To the Unbelievers  
A way (to Triumph)  
Over the Believers.

##### SECTION 21.

142\. The Hypocrites—they think  
They are over-reaching God,  
But He will over-reach them:  
When they stand up to prayer,  
They stand without earnestness,  
To be seen of men,  
But little do they hold  
God in remembrance;

143\. (They are) distracted in mind  
Even in the midst of it,—  
Being (sincerely) for neither  
One group nor for another.  
Whom God leaves straying,—  
Never wilt thou find

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

For him the Way.

144\. O ye who believe!  
Take not for friends  
Unbelievers rather than  
Believers: do ye wish  
To offer God an open  
Proof against yourselves?

145\. The Hypocrites will be  
In the lowest depths  
Of the Fire: no helper  
Wilt thou find for them;—

146\. Except for those who repent,  
Mend (their life), hold fast  
To God, and purify their religion  
As in God's sight: if so  
They will be (numbered)  
With the Believers.  
And soon will God  
Grant to the Believers  
A reward of immense value.

147\. What can God gain  
By your punishment,  
If ye are grateful  
And ye believe?  
Nay, it is God  
That recogniseth  
(All good), and knoweth  
All things.

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

148\. God loveth not that evil  
Should be noised abroad  
In public speech, except  
Where injustice hath been  
Done; for God  
Is He who heareth  
And knoweth all things.

149\. Whether ye publish  
A good deed or conceal it  
Or cover evil with pardon,  
Verily God doth blot out  
(Sins) and hath power  
(In the judgment of values),

150\. Those who deny God  
And His apostles, and (those  
Who) wish to separate  
God from His apostles,  
Saying: "We believe in some  
But reject others":  
And (those who) wish  
To take a course midway,—

151\. They are in truth  
(Equally) Unbelievers;

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

And We have prepared  
For Unbelievers a humiliating  
Punishment.

152\. To those who believe  
In God and His apostles  
And make no distinction  
Between any of the apostles,  
We shall soon give  
Their (due) rewards:  
For God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 22.

153\. The People of the Book  
Ask thee to cause  
A book to descend to them  
From heaven: indeed  
They asked Moses  
For an even greater  
(Miracle), for they said:  
"Show us God in public,"  
But they were dazed  
For their presumption,  
With thunder and lightning.  
Yet they worshipped the calf  
Even after Clear Signs  
Had come to them;  
Even so We forgave them;  
And gave Moses manifest  
Proofs of authority.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

154\. And for their Covenant  
We raised over them  
(The towering height)  
Of Mount (Sinai);  
And (on another occasion)  
We said: "Enter the gate  
With humility"; and (once again)  
We commanded them:  
"Transgress not in the matter  
Of the Sabbath."  
And We took from them  
A solemn Covenant.

155\. (They have incurred divine  
Displeasure): in that they  
Broke their Covenant;  
That they rejected the Signs  
Of God; that they slew  
The Messengers in defiance  
Of right; that they said,  
"Our hearts are the wrappings  
(Which preserve God's Word;  
We need no more)";—nay,  
God hath set the seal on their hearts  
For their blasphemy,  
And little is it they believe;—

156\. That they rejected Faith;  
That they uttered against Mary

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

A grave false charge;

157\. That they said (in boast),  
"We killed Christ Jesus  
The son of Mary,  
The Apostle of God";—  
But they killed him not,  
Nor crucified him,  
But so it was made  
To appear to them,  
And those who differ  
Therein are full of doubts,  
With no (certain) knowledge,  
But only conjecture to follow,  
For of a surety  
They killed him not:—

158\. Nay, God raised him up  
Unto Himself; and God  
Is Exalted in Power, Wise;—

159\. And there is none  
Of the People of the Book

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

But must believe in him  
Before his death;  
And on the Day of Judgment  
He will be a witness  
Against them;—

160\. For the iniquity of the Jews  
We made unlawful for them  
Certain (foods) good and wholesome  
Which had been lawful for them;—  
In that they hindered many  
From God's Way;—

161\. That they took usury,  
Though they were forbidden;  
And that they devoured  
Men's substance wrongfully;—  
We have prepared for those  
Among them who reject Faith  
A grievous punishment.

162\. But those among them  
Who are well-grounded in knowledge,  
And the Believers,  
Believe in what hath been  
Revealed to thee and what was  
Revealed before thee:  
And (especially) those  
Who establish regular prayer  
And practise regular charity  
And believe in God  
And in the Last Day:  
To them shall We soon  
Give a great reward.

##### SECTION 23.

163\. We have sent thee  
Inspiration, as We sent it  
To Noah and the Messengers  
After him: We sent  
Inspiration to Abraham,  
Ismail, Isaac, Jacob  
And the Tribes, to Jesus,  
Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon,  
And to David We gave  
The Psalms.

164\. Of some apostles We have  
Already told thee the story;  
Of others we have not;—  
And to Moses God spoke direct;—

165\. Apostles who gave good news  
As well as warning,  
That mankind, after (the coming)  
Of the apostles, should have  
No plea against God:  
For God is Exalted in Power,  
Wise.

166\. But God beareth witness  
That what He hath sent  
Unto thee He hath sent  
From His (own) knowledge,

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

And the angels bear witness:  
But enough is God for a witness.

167\. Those who reject Faith  
And keep off (men)  
From the Way of God,  
Have verily strayed far,  
Far away from the Path.

168\. Those who reject Faith  
And do wrong,—God  
Will not forgive them  
Nor guide them  
To any way—

169\. Except the way of Hell,  
To dwell therein for ever.  
And this to God is easy.

170\. O mankind! the Apostle  
Hath come to you in truth  
From God: believe in him:  
It is best for you. But if  
Ye reject Faith, to God  
Belong all things in the heavens  
And on earth: and God  
Is All-knowing, All-wise.

171\. O People of the Book!  
Commit no excesses  
In your religion: nor say  
Of God aught but the truth.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

Christ Jesus the son of Mary  
Was (no more than)  
An apostle of God,  
And His Word,  
Which He bestowed on Mary,  
And a Spirit proceeding  
From Him: so believe  
In God and His apostles.  
Say not "Trinity": desist:  
It will be better for you:  
For God is One God:  
Glory be to Him:  
(Far Exalted is He) above  
Having a son, To Him  
Belong all things in the heavens  
And on earth. And enough  
Is God as a Disposer of affairs.

##### SECTION 24.

172\. Christ disdaineth not  
To serve and worship God,  
Nor do the angels, those  
Nearest (to God):  
Those who disdain  
His worship and are arrogant,—  
He will gather them all  
Together unto Himself  
To (answer).

173\. But to those who believe  
And do deeds of righteousness,  
He will give their (due)  
Rewards,—and more,  
Out of His bounty:  
But those who are  
Disdainful and arrogant,  
He will punish

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

With a grievous penalty;  
Nor will they find,  
Besides God, any  
To protect or help them.

174\. O mankind! Verily  
There hath come to you  
A convincing proof  
From your Lord:  
For We have sent unto you  
A light (that is) manifest.

175\. Then those who believe  
In God, and hold fast  
To Him,—soon will He  
Admit them to Mercy  
And Grace from Himself,  
And guide them to Himself  
By a straight Way.

176\. They ask thee  
For a legal decision.  
Say: God directs (thus)  
About those who leave  
No descendants or ascendants  
As heirs. If it is a man  
That dies, leaving a sister  
But no child, she shall

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

Have half the inheritance:  
If (such a deceased was)  
A woman, who left no child,  
Her brother takes her inheritance:  
If there are two sisters,  
They shall have two-thirds  
Of the inheritance  
(Between them): if there are  
Brothers and sisters, (they share),  
The male having twice  
The share of the female.  
Thus doth God make clear  
To you (His law), lest  
Ye err. And God  
Hath knowledge of all things.
