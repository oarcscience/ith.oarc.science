### Sūra XLIII.

### *Zu<u>kh</u>ruf,* or Gold Adornments.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Ha-Mīm*

2\. By the Book that  
Makes things clear,—

3\. We have made it  
A Qur-ān in: Arabic,  
That ye may be able  
To understand (and learn wisdom).

4\. And verily, it is  
In the Mother of the Book,  
In Our Presence, high  
(In dignity), full of wisdom.

5\. Shall We then  
Take away the Message  
From you and repel (you),  
For that ye are a people  
Transgressing beyond bounds?

6\. But how many were  
The prophets We sent  
Amongst the peoples of old?

<span id="page_1325">p. 1325</span>

7\. And never came there  
A prophet to them  
But they mocked him.

8\. So We destroyed (them)—  
Stronger in power than these;—  
And (thus) has passed on  
The Parable of the peoples  
Of old.

9\. If thou wert  
To question them, "Who created  
The heavens and the earth?''  
They would be sure to reply,  
"They were created by (Him),  
The Exalted in Power,  
Full of Knowledge";—

10\. (Yea, the same that)  
Has made for you  
The earth (like a carpet)  
Spread out, and has made  
For you roads (and channels)  
Therein, in order that ye  
May find guidance (on the way);

11\. That sends down  
(From time to time)

<span id="page_1326">p. 1326</span>

Rain from the sky  
In due measure;—  
And We raise to life  
Therewith a land that is  
Dead; even so will ye  
Be raised (from the dead);—

12\. That has created pairs  
In all things, and has made  
For you ships and cattle  
On which ye ride,

13\. In order that ye may  
Sit firm and square  
On their backs, and when  
So seated, ye may  
Celebrate the (kind) favour  
Of your Lord, and say,  
"Glory to Him Who  
Has subjected these  
To our (use), for we  
Could never have accomplished  
This (by ourselves),

14\. "And to our Lord, surely,  
Must we turn back!"

<span id="page_1327">p. 1327</span>

15\. Yet they attribute  
To some of His servants  
A share with Him  
(In His godhead)!  
Truly is man a blasphemous  
Ingrate avowed!

##### SECTION 2.

16\. What! Has He taken  
Daughters out of what He  
Himself creates, and granted  
To you sons for choice?

17\. When news is brought  
To one of them of (the birth  
Of) what he sets up  
As a likeness to (God)  
Most Gracious, his face  
Darkens, and he is filled  
With inward grief!

18\. Is then one brought up  
Among trinkets, and unable  
To give a clear account  
In a dispute (to be  
Associated with God)?

19\. And they make into females  
Angels who themselves serve

<span id="page_1328">p. 1328</span>

God. Did they witness  
Their creation? Their evidence  
Will be recorded, and they  
Will be called to account!

20\. ("Ah!") they say, "If  
It had been the Will  
Of (God) Most Gracious,  
We should not have  
Worshipped such (deities)!"  
Of that they have  
No knowledge! They  
Do nothing but lie!

21\. What! have We given them  
A Book before this,  
To which they are  
Holding fast?

22\. Nay! they say: "We found  
Our fathers following  
A certain religion,  
And we do guide ourselves  
By their footsteps."

23\. Just in the same way,  
Whenever We sent a Warner  
Before thee to any people,  
The wealthy ones among them  
Said: "We found our fathers  
Following a certain religion,  
And we will certainly  
Follow in their footsteps."

<span id="page_1329">p. 1329</span>

24\. He said: "What!  
Even if I brought you  
Better guidance than that  
Which ye found  
Your fathers following?"  
They said: "For us,  
We deny that ye (prophets)  
Are sent (on a mission  
At all)."

25\. So We exacted retribution  
From them: now see  
What was the end  
Of those who rejected (Truth)!

##### SECTION 3.

26\. Behold! Abraham said  
To his father and his people:  
"I do indeed clear myself  
Of what ye worship:

27\. "(I worship) only Him  
Who made me, and He  
Will certainly guide me."

<span id="page_1330">p. 1330</span>

28\. And he left it  
As a Word  
To endure among those  
Who came after him,  
That they may turn back  
(To God).

29\. Yea, I have given  
The good things of this life  
To these (men) and  
Their fathers, until the Truth  
Has come to them,  
And an Apostle  
Making things clear.

30\. But when the Truth came  
To them, they said:  
"This is sorcery, and we  
Do reject it."

31\. Also, they say: "Why  
Is not this Qur-ān sent  
Down to some leading man  
In either of the two  
(Chief) cities?"

32\. Is it they who would portion out  
The Mercy of thy Lord?  
It is We Who portion out  
Between them their livelihood

<span id="page_1331">p. 1331</span>

In the life of this world:  
And We raise some of them  
Above others in ranks,  
So that some may command  
Work from others.  
But the Mercy of thy Lord  
Is better than the (wealth)  
Which they amass.

33\. And were it not that  
(All) men might become  
Of one (evil) way of life,  
We would provide,  
For everyone that blasphemes  
Against (God) Most Gracious,  
Silver roofs for their houses,  
And (silver) stair-ways  
On which to go up,

34\. And (silver) doors  
To their houses, and thrones  
(Of silver) on which  
They could recline,

35\. And also adornments  
Of gold. But all this  
Were nothing but conveniences  
Of the present life:  
The Hereafter, in the sight  
Of thy Lord, is  
For the Righteous.

##### SECTION 4.

36\. If anyone withdraws himself  
From remembrance

<span id="page_1332">p. 1332</span>

Of (God) Most Gracious,  
We appoint for him  
An evil one, to be  
An intimate companion to him.

37\. Such (evil ones) really  
Hinder them from the Path,  
But they think that they  
Are being guided aright!

38\. At length, when (such a one)  
Comes to Us, he says  
(To his evil companion):  
"Would that between me  
And thee were the distance  
Of East and West!" Ah!  
Evil is the companion (indeed)!

39\. When ye have done wrong,  
It will avail you nothing,  
That day, that ye shall be  
Partners in punishment!

40\. Canst thou then make  
The deaf to hear, or give  
Direction to the blind  
Or to such as (wander)  
In manifest error?

<span id="page_1333">p. 1333</span>

41\. Even if We take thee  
Away, We shall be sure  
To exact retribution from them,

42\. Or We shall show thee  
That (accomplished) which We  
Have promised them:  
For verily We shall  
Prevail over them.

43\. So hold thou fast  
To the Revelation sent down  
To thee: verily thou  
Art on a Straight Way.

44\. The (Qur-ān) is indeed  
The Message, for thee  
And for thy people;  
And soon shall ye  
(All) be brought to account.

45\. And question thou our apostles  
Whom We sent before thee;  
Did We appoint any deities  
Other than (God) Most Gracious,  
To be worshipped?

##### SECTION 5.

46\. We did send Moses  
Aforetime, with Our Signs,

<span id="page_1334">p. 1334</span>

To Pharaoh and his Chiefs:  
He said, "I am an apostle  
Of the Lord of the Worlds."

47\. But when he came to them  
With Our Signs, behold,  
They ridiculed them.

48\. We showed them Sign  
After Sign, each greater  
Than, its fellow, and We  
Seized them with Punishment,  
In order that they  
Might turn (to Us).

49\. And they said, "O thou  
Sorcerer! Invoke thy Lord  
For us according to  
His covenant with thee;  
For we shall truly  
Accept guidance."

50\. But when We removed  
The Penalty from them,  
Behold, they broke their word.

51\. And Pharaoh proclaimed  
Among his people, saying:  
"O my people! Does not  
The dominion of Egypt  
Belong to me, (witness)  
These streams flowing  
Underneath my (palace)? What!  
See ye not then?

<span id="page_1335">p. 1335</span>

52\. "Am I not better  
Than this (Moses), who  
Is a contemptible wretch  
And can scarcely  
Express himself clearly?

53\. "Then why are not  
Gold bracelets bestowed  
On him, or (why)  
Come (not) with him  
Angels accompanying him  
In procession?"

54\. Thus did he make  
Fools of his people,  
And they obeyed him:  
Truly were they a people  
Rebellious (against God).

55\. When at length they  
Provoked Us, We exacted  
Retribution from them, and  
We drowned them all.

56\. And We made them  
(A people) of the Past  
And an Example  
To later ages.

<span id="page_1336">p. 1336</span>

##### SECTION 6.

57\. When (Jesus) the son  
Of Mary is held up  
As an example, behold,  
Thy people raise a clamour  
Thereat (in ridicule)!

58\. And they say, "Are  
Our gods best, or he?"  
This they set forth  
To thee, only by way  
Of disputation: yea, they  
Are a contentious people.

59\. He was no more than  
A servant: We granted  
Our favour to him,  
And We made him  
An example to the Children  
Of Israel.

<span id="page_1337">p. 1337</span>

60\. And if it were Our Will,  
We could make angels  
From amongst you, succeeding  
Each other on the earth.

61\. And (Jesus) shall be  
A Sign (for the coming  
Of) the Hour (of Judgment):  
Therefore have no doubt  
About the (Hour), but  
Follow ye Me: this  
Is a Straight Way.

62\. Let not the Evil One  
Hinder you: for he is  
To you an enemy avowed.

63\. When Jesus came  
With Clear Signs, he said:  
"Now have I come  
To you with Wisdom,  
And in order to make  
Clear to you some  
Of the (points) on which  
Ye dispute: therefore fear God  
And obey me.

64\. "For God, He is my Lord  
And your Lord: so worship  
Ye Him: this is  
A Straight Way."

<span id="page_1338">p. 1338</span>

65\. But sects from among  
Themselves fell into disagreement:  
Then woe to the wrong-doers,  
From the Penalty  
Of a Grievous Day!

66\. Do they only wait  
For the Hour—that it  
Should come on them  
All of a sudden,  
While they perceive not?

67\. Friends on that Day  
Will be foes, one  
To another,—except  
The Righteous.

##### SECTION 7.

68\. My devotees  
No fear shall be  
On you that Day,  
Nor shall ye grieve,—

69\. (Being) those who have believed  
In Our Signs and bowed  
(Their wills to Ours) in Islam.

70\. Enter ye the Garden,  
Ye and your wives,  
In (beauty and) rejoicing.

<span id="page_1339">p. 1339</span>

71\. To them will be passed  
Round, dishes and goblets  
Of gold: there will be  
There all that the souls  
Could desire, all that  
The eyes could delight in:  
And ye shall abide  
Therein (for aye).

72\. Such will be the Garden  
Of which ye are made  
Heirs for your (good) deeds  
(In life).

73\. Ye shall have therein  
Abundance of fruit, from which  
Ye shall have satisfaction.

74\. The Sinners will be  
In the Punishment of Hell,  
To dwell therein (for aye):

75\. Nowise will the (punishment)  
Be lightened for them,  
And in despair will they  
Be there overwhelmed.

76\. Nowise shall We  
Be unjust to them:

<span id="page_1340">p. 1340</span>

But it is they who  
Have been unjust themselves.

77\. They will cry: "O Mālik!  
Would that thy Lord  
Put an end to us!"  
He will say, "Nay, but  
Ye shall abide!"

78\. Verily We have brought  
The Truth to you:  
But most of you  
Have a hatred for Truth.

79\. What! Have they settled  
Some Plan (among themselves)?  
But it is We Who  
Settle things.

80\. Or do they think  
That We hear not  
Their secrets and their  
Private counsels? Indeed  
(We do), and Our Messengers  
Are by them, to record.

81\. Say: If (God) Most Gracious  
Had a son, I would  
Be the first to worship."

82\. Glory to the Lord  
Of the heavens and the earth,

<span id="page_1341">p. 1341</span>

The Lord of the Throne  
(Of Authority)! (He is  
Free) from the things  
They attribute (to Him)!

83\. So leave them to babble  
And play (with vanities)  
Until they meet that Day,  
Of theirs, which they  
Have been promised.

84\. It is He Who is God  
In heaven and God on earth;  
And He is Full  
Of Wisdom and Knowledge.

85\. And blessed is He  
To Whom belongs the dominion  
Of the heavens and the earth,  
And all between them:  
With Him is the knowledge  
Of the Hour (of Judgment):  
And to Him shall ye  
Be brought back.

86\. And those whom they invoke  
Besides God have no power  
Of intercession;—only he  
Who bears witness to the Truth,  
And they know (him).

<span id="page_1342">p. 1342</span>

87\. If thou ask them, Who  
Created them, they will  
Certainly say, God: how  
Then are they deluded  
Away (from the Truth)?

88\. (God has knowledge)  
Of the (Prophet's) cry,  
"O my Lord! Truly  
These are a people  
Who will not believe!"

89\. But turn away from them,  
And say "Peace!"  
But soon shall they know!
