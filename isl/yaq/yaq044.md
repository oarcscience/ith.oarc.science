### Sūra XLIV.

### *Du<u>kh</u>ān,* or Smoke (or Mist.)

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Hā-Mīm.*

2\. By the Book that  
Makes things clear;—

3\. We sent it down  
During a blessed night:  
For We (ever) wish  
To warn (against Evil).

4\. In that (night) is made  
Distinct every affair  
Of wisdom,

5\. By command, from Our  
Presence. For We (ever)  
Send (revelations),

6\. As a Mercy  
From thy Lord:  
For He hears and knows  
(All things);

7\. The Lord of the heavens  
And the earth and all

<span id="page_1345">p. 1345</span>

Between them, if ye (but)  
Have an assured faith.

8\. There is no god but He:  
It is He Who gives life  
And gives death,  
The Lord and Cherisher  
To you and your earliest  
Ancestors.

9\. Yet they play about  
In doubt.

10\. Then watch thou  
For the Day  
That the sky will  
Bring forth a kind  
Of smoke (or mist)  
Plainly visible,

11\. Enveloping the people:  
This will be a Penalty  
Grievous.

<span id="page_1346">p. 1346</span>

12\. (They will say:)  
"Our Lord! Remove  
The Penalty from us,  
For we do really believe!"

13\. How shall the Message  
Be (effectual) for them,  
Seeing that an Apostle  
Explaining things clearly  
Has (already) come to them,—

14\. Yet they turn away  
From him and say: "Tutored  
(By others), a man possessed!"

15\. We shall indeed remove  
The Penalty for a while,  
(But) truly ye will revert  
(To your ways).

16\. One day We shall seize  
You with a mighty onslaught:  
We will indeed (then)  
Exact Retribution!

17\. We did, before them,  
Try the people of Pharaoh:

<span id="page_1347">p. 1347</span>

There came to them  
An apostle most honourable,

18\. Saying: "Restore to me  
The servants of God:  
I am to you an apostle  
Worthy of all trust;

19\. "And be not arrogant  
As against God:  
For I come to you  
With authority manifest.

20\. "For me, I have sought  
Safety with my Lord  
And your Lord, against  
Your injuring me.

21\. "If ye believe me not,  
At least keep yourselves  
Away from me."

22\. (But they were aggressive:)  
Then he cried

<span id="page_1348">p. 1348</span>

To his Lord:  
"These are indeed  
A people given to sin."

23\. (The reply came:)  
"March forth with my servants  
By night: for ye are  
Sure to be pursued.

24\. "And leave the sea  
As a furrow (divided):  
For they are a host  
(Destined) to be drowned."

25\. How many were the gardens  
And springs they left behind,

26\. And corn-fields  
And noble buildings,

27\. And wealth (and conveniences  
Of life), wherein they  
Had taken such delight!

28\. Thus (was their end)!  
And We made other people  
Inherit (those things)!

29\. And neither heaven  
Nor earth shed a tear  
Over them: nor were  
They given a respite (again).

<span id="page_1349">p. 1349</span>

##### SECTION 2.

30\. We did deliver aforetime  
The Children of Israel  
From humiliating Punishment,

31\. Inflicted by Pharaoh, for he  
Was arrogant (even) among  
Inordinate transgressors.

32\. And We chose them aforetime  
Above the nations, knowingly,

33\. And granted them Signs  
In which there was  
A manifest trial.

34\. As to these (Quraish),  
They say forsooth:

<span id="page_1350">p. 1350</span>

35\. "There is nothing beyond  
Our first death,  
And we shall not  
Be raised again.

36\. "Then bring (back)  
Our forefathers, if what  
Ye say is true!"

37\. What! are they better  
Than the people of Tubba‘  
And those who were  
Before them? We destroyed  
Them because they were  
Guilty of sin.

38\. We created not  
The heavens, the earth,  
And all between them,  
Merely in (idle) sport:

39\. We created them not  
Except for just ends:  
But most of them  
Do not understand.

40\. Verily the Day of  
Sorting Out is the time  
Appointed for all of them,—

<span id="page_1351">p. 1351</span>

41\. The Day when no protector  
Can avail his client  
In aught, and no help  
Can they receive,

42\. Except such as receive  
God's Mercy: for He is  
Exalted in Might, Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 3.

43\. Verily the tree  
Of  Zaqqūm

44\. Will be the food  
Of the Sinful,—

45\. Like molten brass;  
It will boil  
In their insides,

46\. Like the boiling  
Of scalding water.

47\. (A voice will cry:  
"Seize ye him  
And drag him  
Into the midst  
Of the Blazing Fire!

48\. "Then pour over his head  
The Penalty of Boiling Water

<span id="page_1352">p. 1352</span>

49\. "Taste thou (this)!  
Truly wast thou  
Mighty, full of honour!

50\. "Truly this is what  
Ye used to doubt!"

51\. As to the Righteous  
(They will be) in  
A position of Security,

52\. Among Gardens and Springs;

53\. Dressed in fine silk  
And in rich brocade,  
They will face each other;

54\. So; and We shall  
Join them to Companions  
With beautiful, big,  
And lustrous eyes.

55\. There can they call  
For every kind of fruit  
In peace and security;

<span id="page_1353">p. 1353</span>

56\. Nor will they there  
Taste Death, except the first  
Death; and He will preserve  
Them from the Penalty  
Of the Blazing Fire,—

57\. As a Bounty from thy Lord!  
That will be  
The supreme achievement!

58\. Verily, We have made  
This (Qur-ān) easy,  
In thy tongue,  
In order that they  
May give heed.

59\. So wait thou and watch;  
For they (too) are waiting.
