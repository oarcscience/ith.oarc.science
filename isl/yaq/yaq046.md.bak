### Sūra XLVI.

### *Aḥqāf,* or Winding Sand-tracts.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Hā-Mīm.*

2\. The revelation  
Of the Book  
Is from God  
The Exalted in Power,  
Full of Wisdom.

3\. We created not  
The heavens and the earth  
And all between them  
But for just ends, and  
For a term appointed:  
But those who reject Faith  
Turn away from that  
Whereof they are warned.

4\. Say: "Do ye see  
What it is ye invoke  
Besides God? Show me  
What it is they  
Have created on earth,  
Or have they a share  
In the heavens?  
Bring me a Book

<span id="page_1367">p. 1367</span>

(Revealed) before this,  
Or any remnant of knowledge  
(Ye may have), if ye  
Are telling the truth!

5\. And who is more astray  
Than one who invokes,  
Besides God, such as will  
Not answer him to the Day  
Of Judgment, and who  
(In fact) are unconscious  
Of their call (to them)?

6\. And when mankind  
Are gathered together  
(At the Resurrection),  
They will be hostile  
To them and reject  
Their worship (altogether)!

7\. When Our Clear Signs  
Are rehearsed to them,  
The Unbelievers say,  
Of the Truth  
When it comes to them:  
"This is evident sorcery!"

8\. Or do they say,  
"He has forged it"?  
Say: "Had I forged it,  
Then can ye obtain  
No single (blessing) for me  
From God. He knows best  
Of that whereof ye talk  
(So glibly)! Enough is He

<span id="page_1368">p. 1368</span>

For a witness between me  
And you! And He is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

9\. Say: "I am no bringer  
Of new-fangled doctrine  
Among the apostles, nor  
Do I know what will  
Be done with me or  
With you. I follow  
But that which is revealed  
To me by inspiration;  
I am but a Warner  
Open and clear."

10\. Say: "See ye?  
If (this teaching) be  
From God, and ye reject it,  
And a witness from among  
The Children of Israel testifies  
To its similarity  
(With earlier scripture),  
And has believed  
While ye are arrogant,  
(How unjust ye are!)  
Truly, God guides not  
A people unjust."

##### SECTION 2.

11\. The Unbelievers say  
Of those who believe:

<span id="page_1369">p. 1369</span>

"If (this Message) were  
A good thing, (such men)  
Would not have gone  
To it first, before us!"  
And seeing that they  
Guide not themselves thereby,  
They will say, "This is  
An (old,) old falsehood!"

12\. And before this, was  
The Book of Moses  
As a guide and a mercy:  
And this Book confirms (it)  
In the Arabic tongue;  
To admonish the unjust,  
And as Glad Tidings.  
To those who do right.

13\. Verily those who say,  
"Our Lord is God,"  
And remain firm  
(On that Path),  
On them shall be no fear,  
Nor shall they grieve.

14\. Such shall be Companions  
Of the Garden, dwelling  
Therein (for aye): a recompense  
For their (good) deeds.

<span id="page_1370">p. 1370</span>

15\. We have enjoined on man  
Kindness to his parents:  
In pain did his mother  
Bear him, and in pain  
Did she give him birth.  
The carrying of the (child)  
To his weaning is  
(A period of) thirty months.  
At length, when he reaches  
The age of full strength  
And attains forty years,  
He says, "O my Lord!  
Grant me that I may be  
Grateful for Thy favour  
Which Thou hast bestowed  
Upon me, and upon both  
My parents, and that I  
May work righteousness  
Such as Thou mayest approve;  
And be gracious to me  
In my issue. Truly  
Have I turned to Thee  
And truly do I bow  
(To Thee) in Islām."

16\. Such are they from whom  
We shall accept the best  
Of their deeds and pass by  
Their ill deeds: (they shall

<span id="page_1371">p. 1371</span>

Be) among the Companions  
Of the Garden: a promise!  
Of truth, which was  
Made to them  
(In this life).

17\. But (there is one)  
Who says to his parents,  
"Fie on you! Do ye  
Hold out the promise  
To me that I  
Shall be raised up,  
Even though generations  
Have passed before me  
(Without rising again)?"  
And they two seek  
God's aid, (and rebuke  
The son): "Woe to thee!  
Have Faith! For the promise  
Of God is true."  
But he says, "This is  
Nothing but tales  
Of the ancients!"

18\. Such are they against whom  
Is proved the Sentence  
Among the previous generations  
Of Jinns and men, that have  
Passed away; for they will  
Be (utterly) lost.

19\. And to all  
Are (assigned) degrees

<span id="page_1372">p. 1372</span>

According to the deeds  
Which they (have done),  
And in order that (God)  
May recompense their deeds,  
And no injustice be done  
To them.

20\. And on the Day that  
The Unbelievers will be  
Placed before the Fire,  
(It will be said to them):  
"Ye received your good things  
In the life of the world,  
And ye took your pleasure  
Out of them: but to-day  
Shall ye be recompensed  
With a Penalty of humiliation:  
For that ye were arrogant  
On earth without just cause,  
And that ye (ever) transgressed."

##### SECTION 3.

21\. Mention (Hūd)  
One of ‘Ād's (own) brethren:  
Behold, he warned his people  
About the winding Sand-tracts:  
But there have been Warners  
Before him and after him:  
"Worship ye none other  
Than God: truly I fear  
For you the Penalty  
Of a Mighty Day."

22\. They said: "Hast thou come  
In order to turn us aside

<span id="page_1373">p. 1373</span>

From our gods? Then bring  
Upon us the (calamity)  
With which thou dost  
Threaten us, if thou  
Art telling the truth!"

23\. He said: "The Knowledge  
(Of when it will come)  
Is only with God: I  
Proclaim to you the mission  
On which I have been sent:  
But I see that ye  
Are a people in ignorance!"…

24\. Then, when they saw  
The (Penalty in the shape of)  
A cloud traversing the sky,  
Corning to meet their valleys,  
They said, "This cloud  
Will give us rain!"  
"Nay, it is the (calamity)  
Ye were asking to be  
Hastened!—a wind  
Wherein is a Grievous Penalty!

25\. "Everything will it destroy  
By the command of its Lord!"  
Then by the morning they—  
Nothing was to be seen  
But (the ruins of) their houses!  
Thus do We recompense  
Those given to sin!

<span id="page_1374">p. 1374</span>

26\. And We had firmly established  
Them in a (prosperity and) power  
Which We have not given  
To you (ye Quraish!)  
And We had endowed them  
With (faculties of)  
Hearing, seeing, heart and intellect  
But of no profit to them  
Were their (faculties of)  
Hearing, sight, and heart  
And intellect, when they  
Went on rejecting the Signs  
Of God; and they were  
(Completely) encircled  
By that which they  
Used to mock at!

##### SECTION 4.

27\. We destroyed aforetime  
Populations round about you;  
And We have shown  
The Signs in various ways,  
That they may turn (to Us).

28\. Why then was no help  
Forthcoming to them from those  
Whom they worshipped as gods,  
Besides God, as a means  
Of access (to God)? Nay,  
They left them in the lurch:  
But that was their  
Falsehood and their invention.

<span id="page_1375">p. 1375</span>

29, Behold, We turned  
Towards thee a company  
Of Jinns (quietly) listening  
To the Qur-ān: when they  
Stood in the presence  
Thereof, they said, "Listen  
In silence!" When the (reading)  
Was finished, they returned  
To their people, to warn  
(Them of their sins).

30\. They said, "O our people!  
We have heard a Book  
Revealed after Moses,  
Confirming what came  
Before it: it guides (men)  
To the Truth and  
To a Straight Path.

31\. "O our people, hearken  
To the one who invites  
(You) to God, and believe  
In him: He will forgive  
You your faults,  
And deliver you from  
A Penalty Grievous.

32\. "If any does not hearken  
To the one who invites  
(Us) to God, he cannot  
Frustrate (God's Plan) on earth,  
And no protectors can he have  
Besides God: such men  
(Wander) in manifest error."

<span id="page_1376">p. 1376</span>

33\. See they not that  
God, Who created the heavens  
And the earth, and never  
Wearied with their creation,  
Is able to give life  
To the dead? Yea, verily  
He has power over all things.

34\. And on the Day that  
The Unbelievers will be  
Placed before the Fire,  
(They will be asked,)  
Is this not the Truth?"  
They will say, "Yea,  
By our Lord!"  
(One will say:)  
"Then taste ye  
The Penalty, for that ye  
Were wont to deny (Truth)!"

35\. Therefore patiently persevere,  
As did (all) apostles  
Of inflexible purpose;  
And be in no haste  
About the (Unbelievers). On the Day  
That they see the (Punishment)  
Promised them, (it will be)  
As if they had not  
Tarried more than an hour  
In a single day. (Thine  
But) to proclaim the Message:  
But shall any be destroyed  
Except those who transgress?
