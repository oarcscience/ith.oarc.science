<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful.</i></p>  
<p>1. O thou folded<br> In garments!</p>  
<p>2. Stand (to prayer) by night,<br> But not all night,&#8212;</p>  
<p>3. Half of it,&#8212;<br> Or a little less,</p>  
<p>4. Or a little more;<br> And recite the Qur-&#257;n<br> In slow, measured rhythmic tones.</p>  
<p>5. Soon shall We send down<br> To thee a weighty Message.</p>  
<p>6. Truly the rising by night<br> Is most potent for governing<br> (The soul), and most suitable<br> For (framing) the Word<br> (Of Prayer and Praise).</p>  
<p><a name="page_1634"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1634</font></A></p>  
<p>7. True, there is for thee<br> By day prolonged occupation<br> With ordinary duties:</p>  
<p>8. But keep in remembrance<br> The name of thy Lord<br> And devote thyself<br> To Him whole-heartedly.</p>  
<p>9. (He is) Lord of the East<br> And the West: there is<br> No god but He:<br> Take Him therefore<br> For (thy) Disposer of Affairs.</p>  
<p>10. And have patience with what<br> They say, and leave them<br> With noble (dignity).</p>  
<p>11. And leave Me<br> (Alone to deal with)<br> Those in possession of<br> The good things of life,<br> Who (yet) deny the Truth;<br> And bear with them<br> For a little while.</p>  
<p>12. With Us are Fetters</p>  
<p><a name="page_1635"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1635</font></A></p>  
<p>(To bind them), and a Fire<br> (To burn them),</p>  
<p>13. And a Food that chokes,<br> And a Penalty Grievous.</p>  
<p>14. One Day the earth<br> And the mountains<br> Will be in violent commotion.<br> And the mountains will be<br> As a heap of sand<br> Poured out and flowing down.</p>  
<p>15. We have sent to you,<br> (O men!) an apostle,<br> To be a witness concerning you,<br> Even as We sent<br> An apostle to Pharaoh.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1636"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1636</font></A></p>  
<p>16. But Pharaoh disobeyed<br> The apostle; so We<br> Seized him with<br> A heavy Punishment.</p>  
<p>17. Then how shall ye,<br> If ye deny (God),<br> Guard yourselves against<br> A Day that will make<br> Children hoary-headed?&#8212;</p>  
<p>18. Whereon the sky will be<br> Cleft asunder?<br> His Promise needs must<br> Be accomplished.</p>  
<p>19. Verily this is an Admonition:<br> Therefore, whoso will, let him<br> Take a (straight) path<br> To his Lord!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>20. Thy Lord doth know<br> That thou standest forth<br> (To prayer) nigh two-thirds<br> Of the night, or half</p>  
<p><a name="page_1637"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1637</font></A></p>  
<p>The night, or a third<br> Of the night, and so doth<br> A party of those with thee.<br> But God doth appoint Night<br> And Day in due measure.<br> He knoweth that ye are<br> Unable to keep count thereof.<br> So He hath turned to you<br> (In mercy): read ye,<br> Therefore, of the Qur-&#257;n<br> As much as may be<br> Easy for you. He knoweth<br> That there may be (some)<br> Among you in ill-health;<br> Others travelling through the land,<br> Seeking of God's bounty;<br> Yet others fighting<br> In God's Cause. Read ye,<br> Therefore, as much of the Qur-&#257;n<br> As may be easy (for you);<br> And establish regular Prayer<br> And give regular Charity;<br> And loan to God<br> A Beautiful Loan.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1638"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1638</font></A></p>  
<p>And whatever good<br> Ye send forth<br> For your souls,<br> Ye shall find it<br> In God's Presence,&#8212;<br> Yea, better and<br> Greater, in Reward.<br> And seek ye the Grace<br> Of God: for God is<br> Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</p>
