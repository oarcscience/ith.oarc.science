### Sūra XXXVIII.

### Ṣād (being one of the Abbreviated Letters).

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Ṣād:

By the Qur-ān,  
Full of Admonition:  
(This is the Truth).

2\. But the Unbelievers  
(Are steeped) in Self-glory  
And Separatism.

3\. How many generations  
Before them did We destroy?  
In the end they cried  
(For mercy)—when  
There was no longer time  
For being saved!

4\. So they wonder  
That a Warner has come

<span id="page_1218">p. 1218</span>

To them from among themselves!  
And the Unbelievers say,  
"This is a sorcerer  
Telling lies!

5\. "Has he made the gods  
(All) into one God?  
Truly this is  
A wonderful thing!"

6\. And the leaders among them  
Go away (impatiently), (saying),  
"Walk ye away, and remain  
Constant to your gods!  
For this is truly  
A thing designed (against you)!

7\. "We never heard (the like)  
Of this among the people  
Of these latter days:  
This is nothing but  
A made-up tale!"

8\. "What! Has the Message  
Been sent to him—

<span id="page_1219">p. 1219</span>

(Of all persons) among us?"…  
But they are in doubt  
Concerning My (own) Message!  
Nay, they have not yet  
Tasted My Punishment!

9\. Or have they the Treasures  
Of the Mercy of thy Lord,—  
The Exalted in Power,  
The Grantor of Bounties  
Without measure?

10\. Or have they the dominion  
Of the heavens and the earth  
And all between? If so,  
Let them mount up  
With the ropes and means  
(To reach that end)!

11\. But there—will be  
Put to flight even a host  
Of confederates.

12\. Before them (were many  
Who) rejected apostles,—  
The People of Noah,  
And ‘Ād, and Pharaoh  
The Lord of Stakes,

<span id="page_1220">p. 1220</span>

13\. And <u>Th</u>amūd, and the People  
Of Lūṭ, and the Companions  
Of the Wood;—such were  
The Confederates.

14\. Not one (of them) but  
Rejected the apostles,  
But My Punishment  
Came justly and inevitably  
(On them).

##### SECTION 2.

15\. These (to-day) only wait  
For a single mighty Blast,  
Which (when it comes)  
Will brook no delay.

16\. They say: "Our Lord!  
Hasten to us our sentence  
(Even) before the Day  
Of Account!"

17\. Have patience at what they  
Say, and remember Our Servant  
David, the man of strength:  
For he ever turned (to God).

<span id="page_1221">p. 1221</span>

18\. It was We that made  
The hills declare,  
In unison with him,  
Our Praises, at eventide  
And at break of day,

19\. And the birds gathered  
(In assemblies): all with him  
Did turn (to God).

20\. We strengthened his kingdom,  
And gave him wisdom  
And sound judgment  
In speech and decision.

21\. Has the Story of  
The Disputants reached thee?  
Behold, they climbed over  
The wall of the private chamber;

22\. When they entered  
The presence of David,  
And he was terrified  
Of them, they said:  
"Fear not: we are two  
Disputants, one of whom  
Has wronged the other:  
Decide now between us  
With truth, and treat us not  
With unjustice, but guide us  
To the even Path.

<span id="page_1222">p. 1222</span>

23\. "This man is my brother:  
He has nine and ninety  
Ewes, and I have (but) one:  
Yet he says, "Commit her  
To my care," and is (moreover)  
Harsh to me in speech."

24\. (David) said: "He has  
Undoubtedly wronged thee  
In demanding thy (single) ewe  
To be added to his (flock  
Of) ewes: truly many  
Are the Partners (in business)  
Who wrong each other:  
Not so do those who believe  
And work deeds of righteousness,  
And how few are they?"…  
And David gathered that we  
Had tried him: he asked  
Forgiveness of his Lord,  
Fell down, bowing  
(In prostration), and turned  
(To God in repentance).

25\. So We forgave him  
This (lapse): he enjoyed,  
Indeed, a Near Approach to Us,  
And a beautiful Place  
Of (final) Return.

<span id="page_1223">p. 1223</span>

26, O David! We did indeed  
Make thee a vicegerent  
On earth: so judge thou  
Between men in truth (and justice):  
Nor follow thou the lusts  
(Of thy heart), for they will  
Mislead thee from the Path  
Of God: for those who  
Wander astray from the Path  
Of God, is a Penalty Grievous,  
For that they forget  
The Day of [Account](errata.htm#7.md).

##### SECTION 3.

27\. Not without purpose did We  
Create heaven and earth  
And all between! That  
Were the thought of Unbelievers!  
But woe to the Unbelievers  
Because of the Fire (of Hell)!

<span id="page_1224">p. 1224</span>

28\. Shall We treat those  
Who believe and work deeds  
Of righteousness, the same  
As those who do mischief  
On earth? Shall We treat  
Those who guard against evil,  
The same as those who  
Turn aside from the right?

29\. (Here is) a Book which  
We have sent down  
Unto thee, full of blessings,  
That they may meditate  
On its Signs, and that  
Men of understanding may  
Receive admonition.

30\. To David We gave  
Solomon (for a son),—  
How excellent in Our service!  
Ever did he turn (to Us)!

31\. Behold, there were brought  
Before him, at eventide,  
Coursers of the highest breeding,  
And swift of foot;

<span id="page_1225">p. 1225</span>

32\. And he said, "Truly  
Do I love the love  
Of Good, with a view  
To the glory of my Lord,"—  
Until (the sun) was hidden  
In the veil (of Night):

33\. "Bring them back to me."  
Then began he to pass  
His hand over (their) legs  
And their necks.

34\. And We did try  
Solomon: We placed  
On his throne a body  
(Without life): but he did turn  
(To Us in true devotion):

35\. He said, "O my Lord!  
Forgive me, and grant me

<span id="page_1226">p. 1226</span>

A Kingdom which,  
(It may be), suits not  
Another after me:  
For Thou art the Grantor  
Of Bounties (without measure).

36\. Then We subjected the Wind  
To his power, to flow  
Gently to his order,  
Whithersoever he willed,—

37\. As also the evil ones,  
(Including) every kind  
Of builder and diver,—

38\. As also others bound  
Together in fetters.

39\. "Such are Our Bounties:  
Whether thou bestow them  
(On others) or withhold them,  
No account will be asked."

40\. And he enjoyed, indeed,  
A Near Approach to Us,  
And a beautiful Place  
Of (final) Return.

##### SECTION 4.

41\. Commemorate Our Servant Job.

<span id="page_1227">p. 1227</span>

Behold he cried to his Lord:  
"The Evil One has afflicted  
Me with distress and suffering!"

42\. (The command was given:)  
"Strike with thy foot:  
Here is (water) wherein  
To wash, coal and refreshing,  
And (water) to drink."

43\. And We gave him (back)  
His people, and doubled  
Their number,—as a Grace  
From Ourselves, and a thing  
For commemoration, for all  
Who have Understanding.

44\. "And take in thy hand  
A little grass, and strike  
Therewith: and break not  
(Thy oath)." Truly We found  
Him full of patience and constancy.  
How excellent in Our service!  
Ever did he turn (to Us)!

45\. And commemorate Our Servants  
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,  
Possessors of Power and Vision.

<span id="page_1228">p. 1228</span>

46\. Verily We did choose them  
For a special (purpose)—  
Proclaiming the Message  
Of the Hereafter.

47\. They were, in Our sight,  
Truly, of the company  
Of the Elect and the Good.

48\. And commemorate Ismā‘īl,  
Elisha, and Ẓul-Kifl:  
Each of them was  
Of the company of the Good.

49\. This is a Message  
(Of admonition): and verily,  
For the Righteous,  
Is a beautiful place  
Of (final) Return,—

50\. Gardens of Eternity,  
Whose doors will (ever)  
Be open to them;

51\. Therein will they  
Recline (at ease);  
Therein can they  
Call (at pleasure)  
For fruit in abundance,  
And (delicious) drink;

<span id="page_1229">p. 1229</span>

52\. And beside them will be  
Chaste women restraining  
Their glances, (companions)  
Of equal age.

53\. Such is the Promise  
Made to you  
For the Day of Account!

54\. Truly such will be  
Our Bounty (to you);  
It will never fail;—

55\. ''Yea, such! But  
For the wrong-doers  
Will be an evil place  
Of (final) Return!—

56\. Hell!—they will burn  
Therein,—an evil bed  
(Indeed, to lie on)!—

57\. Yea, such!—Then  
Shall they taste it,  
A boiling fluid, and a fluid  
Dark, murky, intensely cold!—

58\. And other Penalties  
Of a similar kind,  
To match them!

<span id="page_1230">p. 1230</span>

59\. Here is a troop  
Rushing headlong with you!  
No welcome for them!  
Truly, they shall burn  
In the Fire!

60\. (The followers shall cry  
To the misleaders:)  
"Nay, ye (too)! No welcome  
For you! It is ye who  
Have brought this upon us!  
Now evil is (this) place  
To stay in!"

61\. They will say: "Our Lord!  
Whoever brought this upon us,—  
Add to him a double  
Penalty in the Fire!"

62\. And they will say:  
"What has happened to us  
That we see not men  
Whom we used to number  
Among the bad ones?

63\. "Did we treat them  
(As such) in ridicule,  
Or have (our) eyes  
Failed to perceive them?"

64\. Truly that is just and fitting,—  
The mutual recriminations  
Of the People of the Fire!

<span id="page_1231">p. 1231</span>

##### SECTION 5.

65\. Say: "Truly am I  
A Warner: no god  
Is there but the One  
God, Supreme and Irresistible,—

66\. "The Lord of the heavens  
And the earth, and all  
Between,—Exalted in Might,  
Able to enforce His Will,  
Forgiving again and again."

67\. Say: "That is a Message  
Supreme (above all),—

68\. "From which ye  
Do turn away!

69\. "No knowledge have I  
Of the Chiefs on high,  
When they discuss  
(Matters) among themselves.

<span id="page_1232">p. 1232</span>

70\. "Only this has been revealed  
To me: that I am  
To give warning  
Plainly and publicly."

71\. Behold, thy Lord said  
To the angels: "I am  
About to create man  
From clay:

72\. "When I have fashioned him  
(In due proportion) and breathed  
Into him of My spirit,  
Fall ye down in obeisance  
Unto him."

73\. So the angels prostrated themselves,  
All of them together:

74\. Not so Iblīs: he  
Was haughty, and became  
One of those who reject Faith.

75\. (God) said: "O Iblīs!  
What prevents thee from  
Prostrating thyself to one  
Whom I have created  
With My hands?  
Art thou haughty?

<span id="page_1233">p. 1233</span>

Or art thou one  
Of the high (and mighty) ones?"

76\. (Iblīs) said: "I am better  
Than he: Thou createdst  
Me from fire, and him  
Thou createdst from clay."

77\. (God) said: "Then get thee  
Out from here: for thou  
Art rejected, accursed.

78\. "And My Curse shall be  
On thee till the Day  
Of Judgment."

79\. (Iblīs) said: "O my Lord!  
Give me then respite  
Till the Day  
The (dead) are raised."

80\. (God) said: "Respite then  
Is granted thee—

81\. "Till the Day  
Of the Time Appointed."

82\. (Iblīs) said: "Then,  
By Thy Power, I will  
Put them all in the wrong,—

<span id="page_1234">p. 1234</span>

83\. "Except Thy Servants  
Amongst them, sincere  
And purified (by Thy grace)."

84\. (God) said: "Then  
It is just and fitting—  
And I say what is  
Just and fitting—

85\. "That I will certainly fill  
Hell with thee  
And those that follow thee,—  
Every one."

86\. Say: "No reward do I ask  
Of you for this (Qur-ān),  
Nor am I a pretender.

87\. "This is no less than  
A Message to (all)  
The Worlds.

88\. "And ye shall certainly  
Know the truth of it (all)  
After a while."
