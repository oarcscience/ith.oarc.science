<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i>.</p>  
<p>1. A S&#363;ra which We<br> Have sent down and<br> Which We have ordained:<br> In it have We sent down<br> Clear Signs, in order that<br> Ye may receive admonition.</p>  
<p>2. The woman and the man<br> Guilty of adultery or fornication,&#8212;<br> Flog each of them<br> With a hundred stripes:<br> Let not compassion move you<br> In their case, in a matter<br> Prescribed by God, if ye believe<br> In God and the Last Day:<br> And let a party<br> Of the Believers<br> Witness their punishment.</p>  
<p>3. Let no man guilty of<br> Adultery or fornication marry<br> Any but a woman<br> Similarly guilty, or an Unbeliever:<br> Nor let any but such a man<br> Or an Unbeliever<br> Marry such a woman:<br> To the Believers such a thing<br> Is forbidden.</p>  
<p><a name="page_897"><font size="1" color="green">p. 897</font></A></p>  
<p>4. And those who launch<br> A charge against chaste women,<br> And produce not four witnesses<br> (To support their allegations),&#8212;<br> Flog them with eighty stripes;<br> And reject their evidence<br> Ever after: for such men<br> Are wicked transgressors;&#8212;</p>  
<p>5. Unless they repent thereafter<br> And mend (their conduct);<br> For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
<p>6. And for those who launch<br> A charge against their spouses,<br> And have (in support)<br> No evidence but their own,&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_898"><font size="1" color="green">p. 898</font></A></p>  
<p>Their solitary evidence<br> (Can be received) if they<br> Bear witness four times<br> (With an oath) by God<br> That they are solemnly<br> Telling the truth;</p>  
<p>7. And the fifth (oath)<br> (Should be) that they solemnly<br> Invoke the curse of God<br> On themselves if they<br> Tell a lie.</p>  
<p>8. But it would avert<br> The punishment from the wife,<br> If she bears witness<br> Four times (with an oath)<br> By God, that (her husband)<br> Is telling a lie;</p>  
<p>9. And the fifth (oath)<br> Should be that she solemnly<br> Invokes the wrath of God<br> On herself if (her accuser)<br> Is telling the truth.</p>  
<p>10. If it were not<br> For God's grace and mercy<br> On you, and that God<br> Is Oft-Returning,<br> Full of wisdom,<br> (Ye would be ruined indeed).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>11. Those who brought forward<br> The lie are a body</p>  
<p><a name="page_899"><font size="1" color="green">p. 899</font></A></p>  
<p>Among yourselves: think it not<br> To be an evil to you;<br> On the contrary it is good<br> For you: to every man<br> Among them (will come<br> The punishment) of the sin<br> That he earned, and to him<br> Who took on himself the lead<br> Among them, will be<br> A Penalty grievous.</p>  
<p>12. Why did not the Believers<br> Men and women&#8212;when ye<br> Heard of the affair,&#8212;put<br> The best construction on it<br> In their own minds<br> And say, "This (charge)<br> Is an obvious lie"?</p>  
<p>13. Why did they not bring<br> Four witnesses to prove it?<br> When they have not brought<br> The witnesses, such men,<br> In the sight of God,<br> (Stand forth) themselves as liars!</p>  
<p>14. Were it not for the grace<br> And mercy of God on you,<br> In this world and the Hereafter,<br> A grievous penalty would have<br> Seized you in that ye rushed<br> Glibly into this affair.</p>  
<p>15. Behold, ye received it<br> On your tongues,</p>  
<p><a name="page_900"><font size="1" color="green">p. 900</font></A></p>  
<p>And said out of your mouths<br> Things of which ye had<br> No knowledge; and ye thought<br> It to be a light matter,<br> While it was most serious<br> In the sight of God.</p>  
<p>16. And why did ye not,<br> When ye heard it, say?&#8212;<br> "It is not right of us<br> To speak of this:<br> Glory to God! this is<br> A most serious slander!"</p>  
<p>17. God doth admonish you,<br> That ye may never repeat<br> Such (conduct), if ye<br> Are (true) Believers.</p>  
<p>18. And God makes the Signs<br> Plain to you: for God<br> Is full of knowledge and wisdom.</p>  
<p>19. Those who love (to see)<br> Scandal published broadcast<br> Among the Believers, will have<br> A grievous Penalty in this life<br> And in the Hereafter: God<br> Knows, and ye know not.</p>  
<p>20. Were it not for the grace<br> And mercy of God on you,</p>  
<p><a name="page_901"><font size="1" color="green">p. 901</font></A></p>  
<p>And that God is<br> Full of kindness and mercy,<br> (Ye would be ruined indeed).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>21. O ye who believe!<br> Follow not Satan's footsteps:<br> If any will follow the footsteps<br> Of Satan, he will (but) command<br> What is shameful and wrong:<br> And were it not for the grace<br> And mercy of God on you.<br> Not one of you would ever<br> Have been pure: but God<br> Doth purify whom He pleases:<br> And God is One Who<br> Hears and knows (all things).</p>  
<p>22. Let not those among you<br> Who are endued with grace<br> And amplitude of means<br> Resolve by oath against helping<br> Their kinsmen, those in want,<br> And those who have left</p>  
<p><a name="page_902"><font size="1" color="green">p. 902</font></A></p>  
<p>Their homes in God's cause:<br> Let them forgive and overlook,<br> Do you not wish<br> That God should forgive you?<br> For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
<p>23. Those who slander chaste women,<br> Indiscreet but believing,<br> Are cursed in this life<br> And in the Hereafter:<br> For them is a grievous Penalty,&#8212;</p>  
<p>24. On the Day when their tongues,<br> Their hands, and their feet<br> Will bear witness against them<br> As to their actions.</p>  
<p>25. On that Day God<br> Will pay them back<br> (All) their just dues,<br> And they will realise<br> That God is<br> The (very) Truth,<br> That makes all things manifest.</p>  
<p>26. Women impure are for men impure<br> And men impure for women impure<br> And women of purity<br> Are for men of purity,<br> And men of purity<br> Are for women of purity:<br> These are not affected</p>  
<p><a name="page_903"><font size="1" color="green">p. 903</font></A></p>  
<p>By what people say:<br> For them there is forgiveness,<br> And a provision honourable.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
<p>27. O ye who believe!<br> Enter not houses other than<br> Your own, until ye have<br> Asked permission and saluted<br> Those in them: that is<br> Best for you, in order that<br> Ye may heed (what is seemly).</p>  
<p>28. If ye find no one<br> In the house, enter not<br> Until permission is given<br> To you: if ye are asked<br> To go back, go back:<br> That makes for greater purity</p>  
<p><a name="page_904"><font size="1" color="green">p. 904</font></A></p>  
<p>For yourselves: and God<br> Knows well all that ye do.</p>  
<p>29. It is no fault on your part<br> To enter houses not used<br> For living in, which serve<br> Some (other) use for you:<br> And God has knowledge<br> Of what ye reveal<br> And what ye conceal.</p>  
<p>30. Say to the believing men<br> That they should lower<br> Their gaze and guard<br> Their modesty: that will make<br> For greater purity for them:<br> And God is well acquainted<br> With all that they do.</p>  
<p>31. And say to the believing women<br> That they should lower<br> Their gaze and guard<br> Their modesty; that they<br> Should not display their<br> Beauty and ornaments except<br> What (must ordinarily) appear<br> Thereof; that they should</p>  
<p><a name="page_905"><font size="1" color="green">p. 905</font></A></p>  
<p>Draw their veils over<br> Their bosoms and not display<br> Their beauty except<br> To their husbands, their fathers,<br> Their husbands&#8217; fathers, their sons,<br> Their husbands&#8217; sons,<br> Their brothers or their brothers&#8217; sons,<br> Or their sisters&#8217; sons,<br> Or their women, or the slaves<br> Whom their right hands<br> Possess, or male servants<br> Free of physical needs,<br> Or small children who<br> Have no sense of the shame<br> Of sex; and that they<br> Should not strike their feet<br> In order to draw attention<br> To their hidden ornaments.<br> And O ye Believers!<br> Turn ye all together<br> Towards God, that ye<br> May attain Bliss.</p>  
<p>32. Marry those among you<br> Who are single, or<br> The virtuous ones among<br> Your slaves, male or female:<br> If they are in poverty,<br> God will give them<br> Means out of His grace:<br> For God encompasseth all,<br> And He knoweth all things.</p>  
<p><a name="page_906"><font size="1" color="green">p. 906</font></A></p>  
<p>33. Let those who find not<br> The wherewithal for marriage<br> Keep themselves chaste, until<br> God gives them means<br> Out of His grace.<br> And if any of your slaves<br> Ask for a deed in writing<br> (To enable them to earn<br> Their freedom for a certain sum),<br> Give them such a deed<br> If ye know any good<br> In them; yea, give them<br> Something yourselves<br> Out of the means which<br> God has given to you.<br> But force not your maids<br> To prostitution when they desire<br> Chastity, in order that ye<br> May make a gain<br> In the goods of this life.<br> But if anyone compels them,<br> Yet, after such compulsion,<br> Is God Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful (to them).</p>  
<p>34. We have already sent down<br> To you verses making things<br> Clear, an illustration from (the story<br> Of) people who passed away<br> Before you, and an admonition<br> For those who fear (God).</p>  
<p><a name="page_907"><font size="1" color="green">p. 907</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
<p>35. God is the Light<br> Of the heavens and the earth.<br> The parable of His Light<br> Is as if there were a Niche<br> And within it a Lamp:<br> The Lamp enclosed in Glass:</p>  
<p><a name="page_908"><font size="1" color="green">p. 908</font></A></p>  
<p>The glass as it were<br> A brilliant star:<br> Lit from a blessed Tree,<br> An Olive, neither of the East<br> Nor of the West,<br> Whose Oil is well-nigh<br> Luminous,<br> Though fire scarce touched it<br> Light upon Light!<br> God doth guide<br> Whom He will<br> To His Light:<br> God doth set forth Parables<br> For men: and God<br> Doth know all things.</p>  
<p>36. (Lit is such a Light)<br> In houses, which God<br> Hath permitted to be raised<br> To honour; for the celebration,</p>  
<p><a name="page_909"><font size="1" color="green">p. 909</font></A></p>  
<p>In them, of His name:<br> In them is He glorified<br> In the mornings and<br> In the evenings, (again and again),</p>  
<p>37. By men whom neither<br> Traffic nor merchandise<br> Can divert from the Remembrance<br> Of God, nor from regular Prayer,<br> Nor from the practice<br> Of regular Charity:<br> Their (only) fear is<br> For the Day when<br> Hearts and eyes<br> Will be transformed<br> (In a world wholly new),&#8212;</p>  
<p>38. That God may reward them<br> According to the best<br> Of their deeds, and add<br> Even more for them<br> Out of His Grace:<br> For God doth provide<br> For those whom He will,<br> Without measure.</p>  
<p>39. but the Unbelievers,&#8212;<br> Their deeds are like a mirage</p>  
<p><a name="page_910"><font size="1" color="green">p. 910</font></A></p>  
<p>In sandy deserts, which<br> The man parched with thirst<br> Mistakes for water; until<br> When he comes up to it,<br> He finds it to be nothing:<br> But he finds God<br> (Ever) with him, and God<br> Will pay him his account:<br> And God is swift<br> In taking account.</p>  
<p>40. Or (the Unbelievers&#8217; state)<br> Is like the depths of darkness<br> In a vast deep ocean,<br> Overwhelmed with billow<br> Topped by billow,<br> Topped by (dark) clouds:<br> Depths of darkness, one<br> Above another: if a man<br> Stretches out his hand,<br> He can hardly see it!<br> For any to whom God<br> Giveth not light,<br> There is no light!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
<p>41. Seest thou not that it is<br> God Whose praises all beings<br> In the heavens and on earth<br> Do celebrate, and the birds</p>  
<p><a name="page_911"><font size="1" color="green">p. 911</font></A></p>  
<p>(Of the air) with wings<br> Outspread? Each one knows<br> Its own (mode of) prayer<br> And praise. And God<br> Knows well all that they do.</p>  
<p>42. Yea, to God belongs<br> The dominion of the heavens<br> And the earth; and to God<br> Is the final goal (of all).</p>  
<p>43. Seest thou not that God<br> Makes the clouds move<br> Gently, then joins them<br> Together, then makes them<br> Into a heap?&#8212;then wilt thou<br> See rain issue forth<br> From their midst. And He<br> Sends down from the sky<br> Mountain masses (of clouds)<br> Wherein is hail: He strikes<br> Therewith whom He pleases<br> And He turns it away<br> From whom He pleases.<br> The vivid flash of His lightning<br> Well-nigh blinds the sight.</p>  
<p>44. It is God Who alternates<br> The Night and the Day:</p>  
<p><a name="page_912"><font size="1" color="green">p. 912</font></A></p>  
<p>Verily in these things<br> Is an instructive example<br> For those who have vision!</p>  
<p>45. And God has created<br> Every animal from water: sort<br> Of them there are some<br> That creep on their bellies;<br> Some that walk on two legs;<br> And some that walk on four.<br> God creates what He wills;<br> For verily God has power<br> Over all things.</p>  
<p>46. We have indeed sent down<br> Signs that make things manifest:<br> And God guides whom He wills<br> To a Way that is straight.</p>  
<p>47. They say, "We believe<br> In God and in the Apostle,<br> And we obey": but<br> Even after that, some of them<br> Turn away: they are not<br> (Really) Believers.</p>  
<p>48. When they are summoned<br> To God and His Apostle,<br> In order that he may judge<br> Between them, behold, some<br> Of them decline (to come).</p>  
<p><a name="page_913"><font size="1" color="green">p. 913</font></A></p>  
<p>49. But if the right is<br> On their side, they come<br> To him with all submission</p>  
<p>50. Is it that there is<br> A disease in their hearts<br> Or do they doubt,<br> Or are they in fear,<br> That God and His Apostle<br> Will deal unjustly with them?<br> Nay, it is they themselves<br> Who do wrong.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 7.</h5>  
<p>51. The answer of the Believers,<br> When summoned to God<br> And His Apostle, in order<br> That he may judge between them,<br> Is no other than this:<br> They say, "We hear and we obey":<br> It is such as these<br> That will attain felicity.</p>  
<p>52. It is such as obey<br> God and His Apostle,<br> And fear God and do<br> Right, that will win<br> (In the end).</p>  
<p>53. They swear their strongest oaths<br> By God that, if only thou</p>  
<p><a name="page_914"><font size="1" color="green">p. 914</font></A></p>  
<p>Wouldst command them, they<br> Would leave (their homes).<br> Say: "Swear ye not;<br> Obedience is (more) reasonable;<br> Verily, God is well acquainted<br> With all that ye do."</p>  
<p>54. Say: "Obey God, and obey<br> The Apostle: but if ye turn<br> Away, he is only responsible<br> For the duty placed on him<br> And ye for that placed<br> On you. If ye obey him,<br> Ye shall be on right guidance.<br> The Apostle's duty is only<br> To preach the clear (Message).</p>  
<p>55. God has promised, to those<br> Among you who believe<br> And work righteous deeds, that He<br> Will, of a surety, grant them<br> In the land, inheritance<br> (Of power), as He granted it<br> To those before them; that<br> He will establish in authority<br> Their religion&#8212;the one<br> Which He has chosen for them;<br> And that He will change<br> (Their state), after the fear<br> In which they (lived), to one</p>  
<p><a name="page_915"><font size="1" color="green">p. 915</font></A></p>  
<p>Of security and peace:<br> 'They will worship Me (alone)<br> And not associate aught with Me.'<br> If any do reject Faith<br> After this, they are<br> Rebellious and wicked.</p>  
<p>56. So establish regular Prayer<br> And give regular Charity;<br> And obey the Apostle;<br> That ye may receive mercy.</p>  
<p>57. Never think thou<br> That the Unbelievers<br> Are going to frustrate<br> (God's Plan) on earth:<br> Their abode is the Fire,&#8212;<br> And it is indeed<br> An evil refuge!</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 8.</h5>  
<p>58. O ye who believe!<br> Let those whom your right hands<br> Possess, and the (children) among you</p>  
<p><a name="page_916"><font size="1" color="green">p. 916</font></A></p>  
<p>Who have not come of age<br> Ask your permission (before<br> They come to your presence),<br> On three occasions: before<br> Morning prayer; the while<br> Ye doff your clothes<br> For the noonday heat;<br> And after the late-night prayer:<br> These are your three times<br> Of undress: outside those times<br> It is not wrong for you<br> Or for them to move about<br> Attending to each other:<br> Thus does God make clear<br> The Signs to you: for God<br> Is full of knowledge and wisdom.</p>  
<p>59. But when the children among you<br> Come of age, let them (also)<br> Ask for permission, as do those<br> Senior to them (in age):<br> Thus does God make clear<br> His Signs to you: for God<br> Is full of knowledge and wisdom.</p>  
<p>60. Such elderly women as are<br> Past the prospect of marriage,&#8212;<br> There is no blame on them<br> If they lay aside</p>  
<p><a name="page_917"><font size="1" color="green">p. 917</font></A></p>  
<p>Their (outer) garments, provided<br> They make not a wanton display<br> Of their beauty: but<br> It is best for them<br> To be modest: and God<br> Is One Who sees and knows<br> All things.</p>  
<p>61. It is no fault in the blind<br> Nor in one born lame, nor<br> In one afflicted with illness,<br> Nor in yourselves, that ye<br> Should eat in your own houses,<br> Or those of your fathers,<br> Or your mothers, or your brothers,<br> Or your sisters, or your father's brothers<br> Or your father's sisters,<br> Or your mother's brothers,<br> Or your mother's sisters,<br> Or in houses of which<br> The keys are in your possession,<br> Or in the house of a sincere<br> Friend of yours: there is<br> No blame on you, whether<br> Ye eat in company or<br> Separately. But if ye<br> Enter houses, salute each other&#8212;<br> A greeting of blessing<br> And purity as from God.</p>  
<p><a name="page_918"><font size="1" color="green">p. 918</font></A></p>  
<p>Thus does God make clear<br> The Signs to you: that ye<br> May understand.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 9.</h5>  
<p>62. Only those are Believers,<br> Who believe in God and<br> His Apostle: when they are<br> With him on a matter<br> Requiring <A HREF="errata.htm#5">collective</A> action,<br> They do not depart until<br> They have asked for his leave;<br> Those who ask for thy leave<br> Are those who believe in God<br> And His Apostle; so when<br> They ask for thy leave,<br> For some business of theirs,<br> Give leave to those of them<br> Whom thou wilt, and ask<br> God for their forgiveness:<br> For God is Oft-Forgiving,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
<p>63. Deem not the summons<br> Of the Apostle among yourselves<br> Like the summons of one<br> Of you to another: God<br> Doth know those of you<br> Who slip away under shelter<br> Of some excuse: then<br> Let those beware who</p>  
<p><a name="page_919"><font size="1" color="green">p. 919</font></A></p>  
<p>Withstand the Apostle's order,<br> Lest some trial befall them,<br> Or a grievous Penalty<br> Be inflicted on them.</p>  
<p>64. Be quite sure that<br> To God doth belong<br> Whatever is in the heavens<br> And on earth. Well doth He<br> Know what ye are intent upon:<br> And one day they will be<br> Brought back to Him, and He<br> Will tell them the truth<br> Of what they did:<br> For God doth know<br> All things.</p>
