### Sūra V.

### Māïda, or The Table Spread.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. <span class="margnote">1</span> O ye who believe!  
Fulfil (all) obligations  
<span class="margnote">2</span> Lawful unto you (for food)  
Are all four-footed animals,  
With the exceptions named:  
But animals of the chase  
Are forbidden while ye  
Are in the Sacred Precincts  
Or in pilgrim garb:  
For God doth command  
According to His Will and Plan

2\. <span class="margnote">3</span> O ye who believe!  
Violate not the sanctity

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

Of the Symbols of God,  
Nor of the Sacred Month,  
Nor of the animals brought  
For sacrifice, nor the garlands  
That mark out such animals,  
Nor the people resorting  
To the Sacred House,  
Seeking of the bounty  
And good pleasure  
Of their Lord.  
But when ye are clear  
Of the Sacred Precincts  
And of pilgrim garb,  
Ye may hunt  
And let not the hatred  
Of some people  
In (once) shutting you out  
Of the Sacred Mosque  
Lead you to transgression  
(And hostility on your part).  
Help ye one another  
In righteousness and piety,  
But help ye not one another  
In sin and rancour:  
Fear God: for God  
Is strict in punishment.

3\. <span class="margnote">4</span> Forbidden to you (for food)  
Are: dead meat, blood,

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

The flesh of swine, and that  
On which hath been invoked  
The name of other than God;  
That which hath been  
Killed by strangling,  
Or by a violent blow,  
Or by a headlong fall,  
Or by being gored to death;  
That which hath been (partly)  
Eaten by a wild animal;  
Unless ye are able  
To slaughter it (in due form);  
That which is sacrificed  
On stone (altars);  
(Forbidden) also is the division  
(Of meat) by raffling  
With arrows: that is impiety.  
This day have those who  
Reject Faith given up  
All hope of your religion:  
Yet fear them not  
But fear Me.  
This day have I  
Perfected your religion  
For you, completed  
My favour upon you,  
And have chosen for you  
Islam as your religion.  
But if any is forced  
By hunger, with no inclination  
To transgression, God is  
Indeed Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

4\. <span class="margnote">5</span> They ask thee what is  
Lawful to them (as food)  
Say: Lawful unto you  
Are (all) things good and pure:  
And what ye have taught  
Your trained hunting animals  
(To catch) in the manner  
Directed to you by God:  
Eat what they catch for you,  
But pronounce the name  
Of God over it: and fear  
God; for God is swift  
In taking account.

5\. <span class="margnote">6</span> This day are (all) things  
Good and pure made lawful  
Unto you. The food  
Of the People of the Book  
Is lawful unto you  
And yours is lawful  
Unto them.  
(Lawful unto you in marriage)  
Are (not only) chaste women  
Who are believers, but  
Chaste women among  
The People of the Book,

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

Revealed before your time,—  
When ye give them  
Their due dowers, and desire  
Chastity, not lewdness,  
Nor secret intrigues.  
If any one rejects faith,  
Fruitless is his work,  
And in the Hereafter  
He will be in the ranks  
Of those who have lost  
(All spiritual good).

##### SECTION 2.

6\. <span class="margnote">7</span> O ye who believe!  
When ye prepare  
For prayer, wash  
Your faces, and your hands  
(And arms) to the elbows;  
Rub your heads (with water);  
And (wash) your feet  
To the ankles.  
If ye are in a state  
Of ceremonial impurity,  
Bathe your whole body.  
But if ye are ill,  
Or on a journey,  
Or one of you cometh  
From offices of nature,  
Or ye have been  
In contact with women,  
And ye find no water,  
Then take for yourselves  
Clean sand or earth,

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

And rub therewith  
Your faces and hands.  
God doth not wish  
To place you in a difficulty,  
But to make you clean,  
And to complete  
His favour to you,  
That ye may be grateful.

7\. <span class="margnote">8</span> And call in remembrance  
The favour of God  
Unto you, and His Covenant,  
Which He ratified  
With you, when ye said:  
"We hear and we obey":  
And fear God, for God  
Knoweth well  
The secrets of your hearts.

8\. <span class="margnote">9</span> O ye who believe!  
Stand out firmly  
For God, as witnesses  
To fair dealing, and let not  
The hatred of others  
To you make you swerve  
To wrong and depart from  
Justice. Be just: that is  
Next to Piety: and fear God.  
For God is well-acquainted  
With all that ye do.

9\. <span class="margnote">10</span> To those who believe  
And do deeds of righteousness  
Hath God promised forgiveness  
And a great reward.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

10\. <span class="margnote">11</span> Those who reject faith  
And deny Our Signs  
Will be Companions  
Of Hell-fire.

11\. <span class="margnote">12</span> O ye who believe  
Call in remembrance  
The favour of God  
Unto you when  
Certain men formed the design  
To stretch out  
Their hands against you,  
But (God) held back  
Their hands from you:  
So fear God. And on God  
Let Believers put  
(All) their trust.

##### SECTION 3.

12\. <span class="margnote">13</span> God did aforetime  
Take a Covenant from  
The Children of Israel,  
And We appointed twelve  
Captains among them.  
And God said: "I am  
With you: if ye (but)  
Establish regular Prayers,

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

Practise regular Charity,  
Believe in My apostles,  
Honour and assist them,  
And loan to God  
A beautiful loan,  
Verily I will wipe out  
From you your evils,  
And admit you to Gardens  
With rivers flowing beneath;  
But if any of you, after this,  
Resisteth faith, he hath truly  
Wandered from the path  
Of rectitude."

13\. <span class="margnote">14</span> But because of their breach  
Of their Covenant, We  
Cursed them, and made  
Their hearts grow hard:  
They change the words  
From their (right) places  
And forget a good part  
Of the Message that was  
Sent them, nor wilt thou  
Cease to find them  
Barring a few—ever  
Bent on (new) deceits:  
But forgive them, and overlook  
(Their misdeeds): for God  
Loveth those who are kind.

14\. <span class="margnote">15</span> From those, too, who call  
Themselves Christians,

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

We did take a Covenant,  
But they forgot a good part  
Of the Message that was  
Sent them: so We estranged  
Them, with enmity and hatred  
Between the one and the other,  
To the Day of Judgment.  
And soon will God show  
Them what it is  
They have done.

15\. <span class="margnote">16</span> O People of the Book!  
There hath come to you  
Our Apostle, revealing  
To you much that ye  
Used to hide in the Book,  
And passing over much  
(That is now unnecessary):  
<span class="margnote">17</span> There hath come to you  
From God a (new) light  
And a perspicuous Book,—

16\. <span class="margnote">18</span> Wherewith God guideth all  
Who seek His good pleasure  
To ways of peace and safety,  
And leadeth them out  
Of darkness, by His Will,  
Unto the light,—guideth them  
To a Path that is Straight.

17\. <span class="margnote">19</span> In blasphemy indeed  
Are those that say  
That God is Christ  
The son of Mary.  
Say: "Who then  
Hath the least power

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

Against God, if His Will  
Were to destroy Christ  
The son of Mary, his mother,  
And all—every one  
That is on the earth?  
For to God belongeth  
The dominion of the heavens  
And the earth, and all  
That is between. He createth  
What He pleaseth. For God  
Hath power over all things."

18\. <span class="margnote">20</span> (Both) the Jews and the
Christians  
Say: "We are sons  
Of God, and His beloved."  
Say: "Why then doth He  
Punish you for your sins?  
Nay, ye are but men,  
Of the men He hath created:  
He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,  
And He punisheth whom He pleaseth:  
And to God belongeth  
The dominion of the heavens  
And the earth, and all  
That is between:  
And unto Him  
Is the final goal (of all)"

19\. <span class="margnote">21</span> O People of the Book!  
Now hath come unto you,  
Making (things) clear unto you,  
Our Apostle, after the break

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

In (the series of) our apostles,  
Lest ye should say:  
"There came unto us  
No bringer of glad tidings  
And no warner (from evil)":  
But now hath come  
Unto you a bringer  
Of glad tidings  
And a warner (from evil).  
And God hath power  
Over all things.

##### SECTION 4.

20\. <span class="margnote">22</span> Remember Moses said  
To his people: "O my People!  
Call in remembrance the favour  
Of God unto you, when He  
Produced prophets among you,  
Made you kings, and gave  
You what He had not given  
To any other among the peoples.

21\. <span class="margnote">23</span> "O my people! enter  
The holy land which  
God hath assigned unto you,  
And turn not back  
Ignominiously, for then  
Will ye be overthrown,  
To your own ruin."

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

22\. <span class="margnote">24</span> They said: "O Moses!  
In this land are a people  
Of exceeding strength:  
Never shall we enter it  
Until they leave it:  
If (once) they leave,  
Then shall we enter."

23\. <span class="margnote">25</span> (But) among (their) God-fearing
men  
Were two on whom  
God had bestowed His grace:  
They said: "Assault them  
At the (proper) Gate:  
When once ye are in,  
Victory will be yours;  
<span class="margnote">26</span> But on God put your trust  
If ye have faith."

24\. <span class="margnote">27</span> They said: "O Moses!  
While they remain there,  
Never shall we be able  
To enter, to the end of time.  
Go thou, and thy Lord,  
And fight ye two,  
While we sit here"  
(And watch)."

25\. <span class="margnote">28</span> He said: "O my Lord!  
I have power only

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

Over myself and my brother:  
So separate us from this  
Rebellious people!"

26\. <span class="margnote">29</span> God said: "Therefore  
Will the land be out  
Of their reach for forty years:  
In distraction will they  
Wander through the land:  
But sorrow thou not  
Over these rebellious people.

##### SECTION 5.

27\. <span class="margnote">30</span> Recite to them the truth  
Of the story of the two sons

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

Of Adam. Behold! they each  
Presented a sacrifice (to God):  
It was accepted from one,  
But not from the other.  
Said the latter: "Be sure  
I will slay thee." "Surely,"  
Said the former, "God  
Doth accept of the sacrifice  
Of those who are righteous.

28\. <span class="margnote">31</span>"If thou dost stretch thy hand  
Against me, to slay me,  
It is not for me to stretch  
My hand against thee  
To slay thee: for I do fear  
God, the Cherisher of the Worlds.

29\. <span class="margnote">32</span> "For me, I intend to let  
Thee draw on thyself  
My sin as well as thine,  
For thou wilt be among  
The Companions of the Fire,  
And that is the reward  
Of those who do wrong."

30\. <span class="margnote">33</span> The (selfish) soul of the other  
Led him to the murder  
Of his brother: he murdered  
Him, and became (himself)  
One of the lost ones.

31\. <span class="margnote">34</span> Then God sent a raven,  
Who scratched the ground,

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

To show him how to hide  
The shame of his brother.  
"Woe is me!" said he;  
"Was I not even able  
To be as this raven,  
And to hide the shame  
Of my brother?" Then he became  
Full of regrets—

32\. <span class="margnote">35</span> On that account: We ordained  
For the Children of Israel  
That if any one slew  
A person—unless it be  
For murder or for spreading  
Mischief in the land—  
It would be as if  
He slew the whole people:  
And if any one saved a life,  
It would be as if he saved  
The life of the whole people.  
Then although there came  
To them Our Apostles  
With Clear Signs, yet,  
Even after that, many  
Of them continued to commit  
Excesses in the land.

33\. <span class="margnote">36</span> The punishment of those  
Who wage war against God  
And His Apostle, and strive  
With might and main  
For mischief through the land  
Is: execution, or crucifixion,

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

Or the cutting off of hands  
And feet from opposite sides,  
Or exile from the land:  
That is their disgrace  
In this world, and  
A heavy punishment is theirs  
In the Hereafter;

34\. <span class="margnote">37</span> Except for those who repent  
Before they fall  
Into your power:  
In that case, know  
That God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 6.

35\. <span class="margnote">38</span> O ye who believe!  
Do your duty to God,  
Seek the means  
Of approach unto Him,  
And strive with might  
And main in His cause:  
That ye may presper.

36\. <span class="margnote">39</span> As to those who reject  
Faith,—if they had  
Everything on earth,  
And twice repeated,  
To give as ransom  
For the penalty of the Day  
Of Judgment, it would  
Never be accepted of them.  
Theirs would be  
A grievous Penalty.

37\. <span class="margnote">40</span> Their wish will be  
To get out of the Fire,  
But never will they  
Get out therefrom:

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

Their Penalty will be  
One that endures.

38\. <span class="margnote">41</span> As to the thief,  
Male or female,  
Cut off his or her hands:  
A punishment by way  
Of example, from God,  
For their crime:  
And God is Exalted in Power.

39\. <span class="margnote">42</span> But if the thief repent  
After his crime,  
And amend his conduct,  
God turneth to him  
In forgiveness; for God  
Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

40\. <span class="margnote">43</span> Knowest thou not  
That to God (alone)  
Belongeth the dominion  
Of the heavens and the earth?  
He punisheth whom He pleaseth,  
And He forgiveth whom He pleaseth:  
And God hath power  
Over all things.

41\. <span class="margnote">44</span> O Apostle! let not  
Those grieve thee, who race  
Each other into Unbelief:  
(Whether it be) among those  
Who say "We believe"  
With their lips but  
Whose hearts have no faith;

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

Or it be among the Jews,—  
Men who will listen  
To any lie,—will listen  
Even to others who have  
Never so much as come  
To thee. They change the words  
From their (right) times  
And places; they say,  
"If ye are given this,  
Take it, but if not,  
Beware!" If any one's trial  
Is intended by God, thou hast  
No authority in the least  
For him against God.  
For such—it is not  
God's will to purify  
Their hearts. For them  
There is disgrace  
In this world, and  
In the Hereafter  
A heavy punishment.

42\. <span class="margnote">45</span> (They are fond of) listening  
To falsehood, of devouring  
Anything forbidden.  
If they do come to thee,  
Either judge between them,  
Or decline to interfere.  
If thou decline, they cannot  
Hurt thee in the least.  
If thou judge, judge  
In equity between them.  
For God loveth those  
Who judge in equity.

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

43\. <span class="margnote">46</span> But why do they come  
To thee for decision,  
When they have (their own)  
Law before them?  
Therein is the (plain)  
Command of God; yet  
Even after that, they would  
Turn away. For they  
Are not (really)  
People of Faith.

##### SECTION 7.

44\. <span class="margnote">47</span> It was We who revealed  
The Law (to Moses): therein  
Was guidance and light.'  
By its standard have been judged  
The Jews, by the Prophets  
Who bowed (as in Islam)  
To God's Will, by the Rabbis  
And the Doctors of Law:

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

For to them was entrusted  
The protection of God's Book,  
And they were witnesses thereto:  
Therefore fear not men,  
But fear Me, and sell not  
My Signs for a miserable price.  
If any do fail to judge  
By (the light of) what God  
Hath revealed, they are  
(No better than) Unbelievers.

45\. <span class="margnote">48</span> We ordained therein for them:  
"Life for life, eye for eye,  
Nose for nose, ear for ear,  
Tooth for tooth, and wounds  
Equal for equal." But if  
Any one remits the retaliation  
Byway of charity, it is  
An act of atonement for himself.  
And if any fail to judge  
By (the light of) what God  
Hath revealed, they are  
(No better than) wrong-doers.

46\. <span class="margnote">49</span> And in their footsteps  
We sent Jesus the son

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

Of Mary, confirming  
The Law that had come  
Before him: We sent him  
The Gospel: therein  
Was guidance and light,  
And confirmation of the Law  
That had come before him:  
A guidance and an admonition  
To those who fear God.

47\. <span class="margnote">50</span> Let the People of the Gospel  
Judge by what God hath revealed  
Therein. If any do fail  
To judge by (the light of)  
What God hath revealed,  
They are (no better than)  
Those who rebel.

48\. <span class="margnote">51</span> To thee We sent the Scripture  
In truth, confirming  
The scripture that came  
Before it, and guarding it's  
In safety: so judge  
Between them by what  
God hath revealed,  
And follow not their vain  
Desires, diverging  
From the Truth that hath come  
To thee. To each among you  
Have We prescribed a Law  
And an Open Way.  
If God had so willed.  
He would have made you  
A single People, but (His

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

Plan is) to test you in what  
He hath given you: so strive  
As in a race in all virtues.  
The goal of you all is to God;  
It is He that will show you  
The truth of the matters  
In which ye dispute;

49\. <span class="margnote">52</span> And this (He commands):  
Judge thou between them  
By what God hath revealed,  
And follow not their vain  
Desires, but beware of them  
Lest they beguile thee  
From any of that (teaching)  
Which God hath sent down  
To thee. And if they turn  
Away, be assured that  
For some of their crimes  
It is God's purpose to punish  
Them. And truly most men  
Are rebellious.

50\. <span class="margnote">53</span> Do they then seek after  
A judgment of (the Days  
Of) Ignorance? But who,  
For a people whose faith  
Is assured, can give  
Better judgment than God?

##### SECTION 8.

51\. <span class="margnote">54</span> O ye who believe!  
Take not the Jews  
And the Christians  
For your friends and protectors:  
They are but friends and protectors)  
To each other. And he

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

Amongst you that turns to them  
(For friendship) is of them.  
Verily God guideth not  
A people unjust.

52\. <span class="margnote">55</span> Those in whose hearts  
Is a disease—thou seest  
How eagerly they run about  
Amongst them, saying:  
"We do fear lest a change  
Of fortune bring us disaster."  
Ah! perhaps God will give  
(Thee) victory, or a decision  
According to His Will.  
Then will they repent  
Of the thoughts which they secretly  
Harboured in their hearts.

53\. <span class="margnote">56</span> And those who believe  
Will say: "Are these  
The men who swore  
Their strongest oaths by God,  
That they were with you?"  
All that they do  
Will be in vain,  
And they will fall  
Into (nothing but) ruin.

54\. <span class="margnote">57</span> O ye who believe!  
If any from among you  
Turn back from his Faith,  
Soon will God produce  
A people whom He will love  
As they will love Him,—  
Lowly with the Believers,  
Mighty against the Rejecters,  
Fighting in the Way of God,  
And never afraid  
Of the reproaches

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

Of such as find fault.  
That is the Grace of God,  
Which He will bestow  
On whom He pleaseth.  
And God encompasseth all,  
And He knoweth all things.

55\. <span class="margnote">58</span> Your (real) friends are  
(No less than) God,  
His Apostle, and the (Fellowship  
Of) Believers,—those who  
Establish regular prayers  
And regular charity,  
And they bow  
Down humbly (in worship).

56\. <span class="margnote">59</span> As to those who turn  
(For friendship) to God,  
His Apostle, and the (Fellowship  
Of) Believers,—it is  
The Fellowship of God  
That must certainly triumph.

##### SECTION 9.

57\. <span class="margnote">60</span> O ye who believe!  
Take not for friends  
And protectors those  
Who take your religion  
For a mockery or sport,—  
Whether among those  
Who received the Scripture  
Before you, or among those

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

Who reject Faith;  
But fear ye God,  
If ye have Faith (indeed).

58\. <span class="margnote">61</span> When ye proclaim  
Your call to prayer,  
They take it (but)  
As mockery and sport;  
That is because they are  
A people without understanding.

59\. <span class="margnote">62</span> Say: "O People of the Book!  
Do ye disapprove of us  
For no other reason than  
That we believe in God,  
And the revelation  
That hath come to us  
And that which came  
Before (us), and (perhaps)  
That most of you  
Are rebellious and disobedient?

60\. <span class="margnote">63</span> Say: "Shall I point out  
To you something much worse  
Than this, (as judged)  
By the treatment it received  
From God? Those who  
Incurred the curse of God  
And His wrath, those of whom some  
He transformed into apes and swine,  
Those who worshipped Evil;—  
These are (many times) worse  
In rank, and far more astray  
From the even Path!"

61\. <span class="margnote">64</span> When they come to thee,  
They say: "We believe":

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

But in fact they enter  
With a mind against Faith,  
And they go out  
With the same.  
But God knoweth fully  
All that they hide.

62\. <span class="margnote">65</span> Many of them dost thou  
See, racing each other  
In sin and rancour,  
And their eating of things  
Forbidden. Evil indeed  
Are the things that they do.

63\. <span class="margnote">66</span> Why do not the Rabbis  
And the doctors of law forbid  
Them from their (habit  
Of) uttering sinful words  
And eating things forbidden?  
Evil indeed are their works.

64\. <span class="margnote">67</span> The Jews say: "God's hand  
Is tied up." Be their hands  
Tied up and be they accursed  
For the (blasphemy) they utter.  
Nay, both His hands  
Are widely outstretched:  
He giveth and spendeth  
(Of His bounty) as He pleaseth.  
But the revelation that  
Cometh to thee from God  
Increaseth in most of them  
Their obstinate rebellion  
And blasphemy. Amongst them  
We have placed enmity

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

And hatred till the Day  
Of Judgment. Every time  
They kindle the fire of war,  
God doth extinguish it;  
But they (ever) strive  
To do mischief on earth.  
And God loveth not  
Those who do mischief.

65\. <span class="margnote">68</span> If only the People of the Book  
Had believed and been righteous,  
We should indeed have  
Blotted out their iniquities  
And admitted them  
To Gardens of Bliss.

66\. <span class="margnote">69</span> If only they had stood fast  
By the Law, the Gospel,  
And all the revelation that was sent  
To them from their Lord,  
They would have enjoyed  
Happiness from every side.'  
There is from among them  
A party on the right course:  
But many of them  
Follow a course that is evil.

##### SECTION 10.

67\. <span class="margnote">70</span> O Apostle! proclaim  
The (Message) which hath been  
Sent to thee from thy Lord.  
If thou didst not, thou

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

Wouldst not have fulfilled  
And proclaimed His Mission.  
And God will defend thee  
From men (who mean mischief).  
For God guideth not  
Those who reject Faith.

68\. <span class="margnote">71</span> Say: "O People of the Book!  
Ye have no ground  
To stand upon unless  
Ye stand fast by the Law,  
The Gospel, and all the revelation  
That has come to you from  
Your Lord." It is the revelation  
That cometh to thee from  
Thy Lord, that increaseth in most  
Of them their obstinate  
Rebellion and blasphemy.  
But sorrow thou not  
Over (these) people without Faith.

69\. <span class="margnote">72</span> Those who believe (in the
Qur-ān),  
Those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),  
And the Sabians and the Christians,—  
Any who believe in God  
And the Last Day,  
And work righteousness,—  
On them shall be no fear,  
Nor shall they grieve.

70\. <span class="margnote">73</span> We took the Covenant  
Of the Children of Israel  
And sent them apostles.  
Every time there came  
To them an apostle  
With what they themselves  
Desired not—some  
(Of these) they called

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

Impostors, and some they  
(Go so far as to) slay.

71\. <span class="margnote">74</span> They thought there would be  
No trial (or punishment);  
So they became blind and deaf;  
Yet God (in mercy) turned  
To them; yet again many  
Of them became blind and deaf.  
But God sees well  
All that they do.

72\. <span class="margnote">75</span> They do blaspheme who say:  
"God is Christ the son  
Of Mary" But said Christ:  
"O Children of Israel!  
Worship God, my Lord  
And your Lord." Whoever  
Joins other gods with God,—  
God will forbid him  
The Garden, and the Fire  
Will be his abode. There will  
For the wrong-doers  
Be no one to help.

73\. <span class="margnote">76</span> They do blaspheme who say:  
God is one of three  
In a Trinity: for there is  
No god except One God.  
If they desist not  
From their word (of blasphemy),  
Verily a grievous penalty  
Will befall the blasphemers  
Among them.

74\. <span class="margnote">77</span> Why turn they not to God,  
And seek His forgiveness?  
For God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

75\. <span class="margnote">78</span> Christ the son of Mary  
Was no more than  
An Apostle; many were  
The apostles that passed away

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

Before him. His mother  
Was a woman of truth.  
They had both to eat  
Their (daily) food.  
See how God doth make  
His Signs clear to them;  
Yet see in what ways  
They are deluded  
Away from the truth!

76\. <span class="margnote">79</span> Say: "Will ye worship,  
Besides God, something  
Which hath no power either  
To harm or benefit you?  
But God,—He it is  
That heareth and knoweth  
All things."

77\. <span class="margnote">80</span> Say: "O People of the Book!  
Exceed not in your religion  
The bounds (of what is proper),  
Trespassing beyond the truth,  
Nor follow the vain desires  
Of people who went wrong  
In times gone by,—who misled  
Many, and strayed (themselves)  
From the even Way.

##### SECTION 11.

78\. <span class="margnote">81</span> Curses were pronounced  
On those among the Children  
Of Israel who rejected Faith,  
By the tongue of David  
And of Jesus the son of Mary:  
Because they disobeyed  
And persisted in Excesses.

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

79\. <span class="margnote">82</span> Nor did they (usually)  
Forbid one another  
The iniquities which they  
Committed: evil indeed  
Were the deeds which they did.

80\. <span class="margnote">83</span> Thou seest many of them  
Turning in friendship  
To the Unbelievers.  
Evil indeed are (the works) which  
Their souls have sent forward  
Before them (with the result),  
That God's wrath  
Is on them,  
And in torment  
Will they abide.

81\. <span class="margnote">84</span> If only they had believed  
In God, in the Apostle,  
And in what hath been  
Revealed to him, never  
Would they have taken  
Them for friends and protectors,  
But most of them are  
Rebellious wrong-doers.

82\. <span class="margnote">85</span> Strongest among men in enmity  
To the Believers wilt thou  
Find the Jews and Pagans;  
And nearest among them in love  
To the Believers wilt thou  
Find those who say,  
"We are Christians":  
Because amongst these are  
Men devoted to learning  
And men who have renounced  
The world, and they  
Are not arrogant.

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

83\. <span class="margnote">86</span> And when they listen  
To the revelation received  
By the Apostle, thou wilt  
See their eyes overflowing  
With tears, for they  
Recognise the truth:  
They pray: "Our Lord!  
We believe; write us  
Down among the witnesses.

84\. <span class="margnote">87</span> "What cause can we have  
Not to believe in God  
And the truth which has  
Come to us, seeing that  
We long for our Lord  
To admit us to the company  
Of the righteous?"

85\. <span class="margnote">88</span> And for this their prayer  
Hath God rewarded them  
With Gardens, with rivers  
Flowing underneath,—their eternal  
Home. Such is the recompense  
Of those who do good.

86\. <span class="margnote">89</span> But those who reject Faith  
And belie Our Signs,—  
They shall be Companions  
Of Hell-fire.

##### SECTION 12.

87\. <span class="margnote">90</span> O ye who believe!  
Make not unlawful

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

The good things which God  
Hath made lawful for you,  
But commit no excess:  
For God loveth not  
Those given to excess.

88\. <span class="margnote">91</span> Eat of the things which  
God hath provided for you,  
Lawful and good; but fear  
God, in Whom ye believe.

89\. <span class="margnote">92</span> God will not call you  
To account for what is  
Futile in your oaths,  
But He will call you  
To account for your deliberate  
Oaths: for expiation, feed  
Ten indigent persons,  
On a scale of the average  
For the food of your families;  
Or clothe them; or give  
A slave his freedom.  
If that is beyond your means,  
Fast for three days.  
That is the expiation  
For the oaths ye have sworn.  
But keep to your oaths.  
Thus doth God make clear  
To you His Signs, that ye  
May be grateful.

90\. <span class="margnote">93</span> O ye who believe!  
Intoxicants and gambling,

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

(Dedication of) stones,  
And (divination by) arrows,  
Are an abomination,—  
Of Satan's handiwork:  
Eschew such (abomination),  
That ye may prosper.

91\. <span class="margnote">94</span> Satan's plan is (but)  
To excite enmity and hatred  
Between you, with intoxicants  
And gambling, and hinder you  
From the remembrance  
Of God, and from prayer:  
Will ye not then abstain?

92\. <span class="margnote">95</span> Obey God, and obey the Apostle,  
And beware (of evil):  
If ye do turn back,  
Know ye that it is  
Our Apostle's duty  
To proclaim (the Message)  
In the clearest manner.

93\. <span class="margnote">96</span> On those who believe  
And do deeds of righteousness  
There is no blame  
For what they ate (in the past),  
When they guard themselves  
From evil, and believe,  
And do deeds of righteousness,—  
(Or) again, guard themselves  
From evil and believe,—  
(Or) again, guard themselves  
From evil and do good.

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

For God loveth those  
Who do good.

##### SECTION 13.

94\. <span class="margnote">97</span> O ye who believe!  
God doth but make a trial of you  
In a little matter  
Of game well within reach  
Of your hands and your lances,  
That He may test  
Who feareth Him unseen:  
Any who transgress  
Thereafter, will have  
A grievous penalty.

95\. <span class="margnote">98</span> O ye who believe!  
Kill not game  
While in the Sacred  
Precincts or in pilgrim garb.  
If any of you doth so  
Intentionally, the compensation  
Is an offering, brought  
To the Ka’ba, of a domestic animal  
Equivalent to the one he killed,

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

As adjudged by two just men  
Among you; or by way  
Of atonement, the feeding  
Of the indigent; or its  
Equivalent in fasts: that he  
May taste of the penalty  
Of his deed. God  
Forgives what is past:  
For repetition God will  
Exact from him the penalty.  
For God is Exalted,  
And Lord of Retribution.

96\. <span class="margnote">99</span> Lawful to you is the pursuit  
Of water-game and its use  
For food,—for the benefit  
Of yourselves and those who  
Travel; but forbidden  
Is the pursuit of land-game;—  
As long as ye are  
In the Sacred Precincts  
Or in pilgrim garb.  
And fear God, to Whom  
Ye shall be gathered back.

97\. <span class="margnote">100</span> God made the Ka’ba,  
The Sacred House, an asylum  
Of security for men, as  
Also the Sacred Months,  
The animals for offerings,  
And the garlands that mark them:  
That ye may know  
That God hath knowledge  
Of what is in the heavens  
And on earth and that God  
Is well acquainted  
With all things.

98\. <span class="margnote">101</span> Know ye that God  
Is strict in punishment

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

And that God is  
Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

99\. <span class="margnote">102</span> The Apostle's duty is  
But to proclaim (the Message).  
But God knoweth all  
That ye reveal and ye conceal.

100\. <span class="margnote">103</span> Say: "Not equal are things  
That are bad and things  
That are good, even though  
The abundance of the bad  
May dazzle thee;  
So fear God, O ye  
That understand;  
That (so) ye may prosper."

##### SECTION 14.

101\. <span class="margnote">104</span> O ye who believe!  
Ask not questions  
About things which,  
If made plain to you,  
May cause you trouble.  
But if ye ask about things  
When the Qur-ān is being  
Revealed, they will be  
Made plain to you,  
God will forgive those:  
For God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Forbearing.

102\. <span class="margnote">105</span> Some people before you  
Did ask such questions,

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

And on that account  
Lost their faith.

103\. <span class="margnote">106</span> It was not God  
Who instituted (superstitions  
Like those of) a slit-ear  
She-camel, or a she-camel  
Let loose for free pasture,  
Or idol sacrifices for  
Twin-births in animals,  
Or stallion-camels  
Freed from work  
It is blasphemers  
Who Invent a lie  
Against God; but most  
Of them lack wisdom.

104\. <span class="margnote">107</span> When it is said to them:  
"Come to what God  
Hath revealed; come  
To the Apostle":  
They say: "Enough for us  
Are the ways we found  
Our fathers following."  
What! even though their fathers  
Were void of knowledge  
And guidance?

105\. <span class="margnote">108</span> O ye who believe!  
Guard your own souls:  
If ye follow (right) guidance,  
No hurt can come to you  
From those who stray.  
The goal of you all  
Is to God: it is He  
That will show you  
The truth of all  
That ye do.

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

106\. <span class="margnote">109</span> O ye who believe!  
When death approaches  
Any of you, (take) witnesses  
Among yourselves when making  
Bequests,—two just men  
Of your own (brotherhood)  
Or others from outside  
If ye are journeying  
Through the earth,  
And the chance of death  
Befalls you (thus).  
If ye doubt (their truth),  
Detain them both  
After prayer, and let them both  
Swear by God:  
"We wish not in this  
For any worldly gain,  
Even though the (beneficiary)  
Be our near relation:  
We shall hide not  
The evidence before God:  
If we do, then behold!  
The sin be upon us!"

107\. <span class="margnote">110</span> But if it gets known  
That these two were guilty  
Of the sin (of perjury),  
Let two others stand forth  
In their places,—nearest  
In kin from among those  
Who claim a lawful right:  
Let them swear by God:  
"We affirm that our witness  
Is truer than that  
Of those two, and that we  
Have not trespassed (beyond  
The truth): if we did,  
Behold! the wrong be  
Upon us!"

108\. <span class="margnote">111</span> That is most suitable:  
That they may give the evidence

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

In its true nature and shape,  
Or else they would fear  
That other oaths would be  
Taken after their oaths.  
Hut fear God, and listen  
(To His counsel): for God  
Guideth not a rebellious people:

##### SECTION 15.

109\. <span class="margnote">112</span> One day will God  
Gather the apostles together,  
And ask: "What was  
The response ye received  
(From men to your teaching)?"  
They will say: "We  
Have no knowledge: it is Thou  
Who knowest in full  
All that is hidden."

110\. <span class="margnote">113</span> When will God say:  
"O Jesus the son of Mary!  
Recount My favour"'  
To thee and to thy mother.  
Behold! I strengthened thee  
With the holy spirit,  
So that thou didst speak  
To the people in childhood  
And in maturity.  
Behold! I taught thee  
The Book and Wisdom,  
The Law and the Gospel.  
And behold! thou makest  
Out of clay, as it were,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

The figure of a bird,  
By My leave,  
And thou breathest into it,  
And it becometh a bird  
By My leave,  
And thou healest those  
Born blind, and the lepers,  
By My leave.  
And behold! thou  
Bringest forth the dead  
By My leave ego  
And behold! I did  
Restrain the Children of Israel  
From (violence to) thee  
When thou didst show them  
The Clear Signs,  
And the unbelievers among them  
Said: 'This is nothing  
But evident magic.

111\. <span class="margnote">114</span> "And behold! I inspired  
The Disciples to have faith  
In Me and Mine Apostle:  
They said, 'We have faith,  
And do thou bear witness  
That we bow to God  
As Muslims'."

112\. <span class="margnote">115</span> Behold! the Disciples said:  
"O Jesus the son of Mary!  
Can thy Lord send down to us  
A Table set (with viands)

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

From heaven?" Said Jesus:  
"Fear God, if ye have faith."

113\. <span class="margnote">116</span> They said: "We only wish  
To eat thereof and satisfy  
Our hearts, and to know  
That thou hast indeed  
Told us the truth; and  
That we ourselves may be  
Witnesses to the miracle."

114\. <span class="margnote">117</span> Said Jesus the son of Mary:  
"O God our Lord!  
Send us from heaven  
A Table set (with viands),  
That there may be for us  
For the first and the last of us—  
A solemn festival  
And a. Sign from Thee;  
And provide for our sustenance,  
For Thou art the best  
Sustainer (of our needs)."

115\. <span class="margnote">118</span> God said: "I will  
Send it down unto you:  
But if any of you  
After that resisteth faith,  
I will punish him  
With a penalty such  
As I have not inflicted  
On any one among

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

All the peoples."

##### SECTION 16.

116\. <span class="margnote">119</span> And behold! God will say:  
"O Jesus the son of Mary!  
Didst thou say unto men,  
Worship me and my mother  
As gods in derogation of God'?"  
He will say: "Glory to Thee!  
Never could I say  
What I had no right  
(To say). Had I said  
Such a thing, Thou wouldst  
Indeed have known it.  
Thou knowest what is  
In my heart, though I  
Know not what is  
In Thine. For Thou  
Knowest in full  
All that is hidden.

117\. <span class="margnote">120</span> "Never said I to them  
Aught except what Thou  
Didst command me  
To say, to wit, 'Worship  
God, my Lord and your Lord';  
And I was a witness  
Over them whilst I dwelt  
Amongst them; when thou  
Didst take me up  
Thou wast the Watcher  
Over them, and Thou  
Art a witness to all things.

118\. <span class="margnote">121</span> "If Thou dost punish them,  
They are Thy servants:

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

If Thou dost forgive them,  
Thou art the Exalted in power,  
The Wise."

119\. <span class="margnote">122</span> God will say: "This is  
A day on which  
The truthful will profit  
From their truth: theirs  
Are Gardens, with rivers  
Flowing beneath,—their eternal  
Home: God well-pleased  
With them, and they with God:  
That is the great Salvation,  
(The fulfilment of all desires).

120\. <span class="margnote">123</span> To God doth belong the
dominion  
Of the heavens and the earth,  
And all that is therein,  
And it is He who hath power  
Over all things.
