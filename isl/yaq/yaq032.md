### Sūra XXXII

### *Sajda*, or Adoration.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. A. L. M.

2\. (This is) the revelation  
Of the Book in which  
There is no doubt,—  
From the Lord of the Worlds.

3\. Or do they say,  
"He has forged it"?  
Nay, it is the Truth  
From thy Lord, that thou  
Mayest admonish a people  
To whom no warner  
Has come before thee:  
In order that they  
May receive guidance.

4\. It is God Who has  
Created the heavens  
And the earth, and all  
Between them, in six Days,

<span id="page_1093">p. 1093</span>

And is firmly established  
On the Throne (of authority):  
Ye have none, besides Him,  
To protect or intercede (for you):  
Will ye not then  
Receive admonition?

5\. He rules (all) affairs  
From the heavens  
To the earth: in the end  
Will (all affairs) go up  
To Him, on a Day,  
The space whereof will be  
(As) a thousand years  
Of your reckoning.

6\. Such is He, the Knower  
Of all things, hidden  
And open, the Exalted  
(In power), the Merciful;—

7\. He Who has made  
Everything which He has created  
Most Good: He began  
The creation of man  
With (nothing more than) clay,

<span id="page_1094">p. 1094</span>

8\. And made his progeny  
From a quintessence  
Of the nature of  
A fluid despised:

9\. But He fashioned him  
In due proportion, and breathed  
Into him something of  
His spirit. And He gave  
You (the faculties of) hearing  
And sight and feeling  
(And understanding):  
Little thanks do ye give!

10\. And they say: "What!  
When we lie, hidden  
And lost, in the earth,  
Shall we indeed be  
In a Creation renewed?  
Nay, they deny the Meeting  
With their Lord!"

11\. Say: "The Angel of Death,  
Put in charge of you,  
Will (duly) take your souls:  
Then shall ye be brought  
Back to your Lord."

<span id="page_1095">p. 1095</span>

##### SECTION 2.

12\. If only thou couldst see  
When the guilty ones  
Will bend low their heads  
Before their Lord, (saying:)  
"Our Lord! We have seen  
And we have heard:  
Now then send us back  
(To the world): we will  
Work righteousness: for we  
Do indeed (now) believe."

13\. If We had so willed,  
We could certainly have brought  
Every soul its true guidance:  
But the Word from Me  
Will come true, "I will  
Fill Hell with Jinns  
And men all together."

14\. "Taste ye then—for ye  
Forgot the Meeting  
Of this Day of yours,  
And We too will  
Forget you—taste ye  
The Penalty of Eternity  
For your (evil) deeds!"

15\. Only those believe  
In Our Signs, who, when

<span id="page_1096">p. 1096</span>

They are recited to them,  
Fall down in adoration,  
And celebrate the praises  
Of their Lord, nor are they  
(Ever) puffed up with pride.

16\. Their limbs do forsake  
Their beds of sleep, the while  
They call on their Lord,  
In Fear and Hope:  
And they spend (in charity)  
Out of the sustenance which  
We have bestowed on them.

17\. Now no person knows  
What delights of the eye  
Are kept hidden (in reserve)  
For them—as a reward  
For their (good) Deeds.

18\. Is then the man  
Who believes no better  
Than the man who is  
Rebellious and wicked?  
Not equal are they.

19\. For those who believe  
And do righteous deeds,  
Are Gardens as hospitable  
Homes, for their (good) deeds.

<span id="page_1097">p. 1097</span>

20\. As to those who are  
Rebellious and wicked, their abode  
Will be the Fire: every time  
They wish to get away  
Therefrom, they will be forced  
Thereinto, and it will be said  
To them: "Taste ye  
The Penalty of the Fire,  
The which ye were wont  
To reject as false."

21\. And indeed We will make  
Them taste of the Penalty  
Of this (life) prior to  
The supreme Penalty, in order  
That they may (repent and) return.

22\. And who does more wrong  
Than one to whom are recited  
The Signs of his Lord,  
And who then turns away  
Therefrom? Verily from those  
Who transgress We shall exact  
(Due) Retribution.

##### SECTION 3.

23\. We did indeed aforetime  
Give the Book to Moses:

<span id="page_1098">p. 1098</span>

Be not then in doubt  
Of its reaching (thee):  
And We made it  
A guide to the Children  
Of Israel.

24\. And We appointed, from among  
Them, Leaders, giving guidance  
Under Our command, so long  
As they persevered with patience  
And continued to have faith  
In Our Signs.

25\. Verily thy Lord will judge  
Between them on the Day  
Of Judgment, in the matters  
Wherein they differ  
(among themselves)

26\. Does it not teach them  
A lesson, how many generations  
We destroyed before them,  
In whose dwellings they  
(Now) go to and fro?  
Verily in that are Signs:  
Do they not then listen?

<span id="page_1099">p. 1099</span>

27\. And do they not see  
That We do drive Rain  
To parched soil (bare  
Of herbage), and produce therewith  
Crops, providing food  
For their cattle and themselves?  
Have they not the vision?

28\. They say: "When will  
This Decision be, if ye  
Are telling the truth?"

29\. Say: "On the Day  
Of Decision, no profit  
Will it he to Unbelievers  
If they (then) believe!  
Nor Will they he granted  
A respite."

30\. So turn away from them,  
And wait: they too  
Are waiting.
