### Sūra C.

### ’Adiyāt, or Those that run.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. By the (Steeds)  
That run, with panting (breath),

2\. And strike sparks of fire,

3\. And push home the charge  
In the morning,

4\. And raise the dust  
In clouds the while,

5\. And penetrate forthwith  
Into the midst (of the foe)  
*En masse;*—

6\. Truly Man is,  
To his Lord,  
Ungrateful;

7\. And to that (fact)  
He bears witness  
(By his deeds);

8\. And violent is he  
In his love of wealth.

9\. Does he not know,—  
When that which is  
In the graves is  
Scattered abroad

10\. And that which is  
(Locked up) in (human) breasts  
Is made manifest—

11\. That their Lord had been  
Well-acquainted with them,  
(Even to) that Day?
