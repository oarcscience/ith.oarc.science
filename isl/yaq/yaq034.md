### Sūra XXXIV.

### *Sabā,* or the City of Sabā

(see verse 15).

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Praise be to God,  
To Whom belong all things  
In the heavens and on earth:  
To Him be Praise  
In the Hereafter:  
And He is Full of Wisdom,  
Acquainted with all things.

2\. He knows all that goes  
Into the earth, and all that  
Comes out thereof; all that  
Comes down from the sky  
And all that ascends thereto  
And He is the Most Merciful,  
The Oft-Forgiving.

3\. The Unbelievers say,  
"Never to us will come

<span id="page_1134">p. 1134</span>

The Hour": say, "Nay!  
But most surely,  
By my Lord, it will come  
Upon you;—by Him  
Who knows the unseen,—  
From Whom is not hidden  
The least little atom  
In the Heavens or on earth:  
Nor is there anything less  
Than that, or greater, but  
Is in the Record Perspicuous:

4\. That He may reward  
Those who believe and work  
Deeds of righteousness: for such  
Is Forgiveness and a Sustenance  
Most Generous."

5\. But those who strive  
Against Our Signs, to frustrate  
Them,—for such will be  
A Penalty,—a Punishment  
Most humiliating.

6\. And those to whom  
Knowledge has come see  
That the (Revelation) sent down  
To thee from thy Lord—  
That is the Truth,  
And that it guides

<span id="page_1135">p. 1135</span>

To the Path of the Exalted  
(In Might), Worthy  
Of all praise.

7\. The Unbelievers say  
(In ridicule): "Shall we  
Point out to you a man  
That will tell you,  
When ye are all scattered  
To pieces in disintegration,  
That ye shall (then be  
Raised) in a New Creation?

8\. "Has he invented a falsehood  
Against God, or has  
A spirit (seized) him?"—  
Nay, it is those who  
Believe not in the Hereafter,  
That are in (real) Penalty,  
And in farthest Error.

9\. See they not what is  
Before them and behind them,  
Of the sky and the earth  
If We wished, We could  
Cause the earth to swallow  
Them up, or cause a piece  
Of the sky to fall upon them.  
Verily in this is a Sign  
For every devotee that  
Turns to God (in repentance).

<span id="page_1136">p. 1136</span>

##### SECTION 2.

10\. We bestowed Grace aforetime  
On David from Ourselves:  
"O ye Mountains! sing ye  
Back the Praises of God  
With him! and ye birds  
(Also)! And We made  
The iron soft for him;—

11\. (Commanding), "Make thou  
Coats of mail, balancing well  
The rings of chain armour,  
And work ye righteousness;  
For be sure I see  
(Clearly) all that ye do."

12\. And to Solomon (We  
Made) the Wind (obedient):  
Its early morning (stride)  
Was a month's (journey),  
And its evening (stride)  
Was a month's (journey);  
And We made a Font  
Of molten brass to flow

<span id="page_1137">p. 1137</span>

For him; and there were  
Jinns that worked in front  
Of him, by the leave  
Of his Lord, and if any  
Of them turned aside  
From Our command, We  
Made him taste  
Of the Penalty  
Of the Blazing Fire.

13\. They worked for him  
As he desired, (making) Arches,  
Images, Basons  
As large as Reservoirs,  
And (cooking) Cauldrons fixed  
(In their places): "Work ye,  
Sons of David, with thanks!  
But few of My servants  
Are grateful!"

14\. Then, when We decreed  
(Solomon's) death, nothing showed them  
His death except a little  
Worm of the earth, which

<span id="page_1138">p. 1138</span>

Kept (slowly) gnawing away  
At his staff: so when he  
Fell down, the Jinns saw  
Plainly that if they had  
Known the unseen, they  
Would not have tarried  
In the humiliating Penalty  
(Of their Task).

15\. There was, for Sabā,  
Aforetime, a Sign in their  
Home-land—two Gardens  
To the right and to the left.  
"Eat of the Sustenance (provided)  
By your Lord, and be grateful  
To Him: a territory fair and happy,  
And a Lord Oft-Forgiving!

16\. But they turned away  
(From God), and We sent  
Against them the flood  
(Released) from the Dams,

<span id="page_1139">p. 1139</span>

And We converted their two  
Garden (rows) into "gardens"  
Producing bitter fruit,  
And tamarisks, and some few  
(Stunted) Lote-trees.

17\. That was the Requital  
We gave them because  
They ungratefully rejected Faith:  
And never do We give  
(Such) requital except to such  
As are ungrateful rejecters.

18\. Between them and the Cities  
On which We had poured  
Our blessings, We had placed  
Cities in prominent positions,  
And between them We had  
Appointed stages of journey  
In due proportion: "Travel therein,  
Secure, by night and by day."

19\. But they said: "Our Lord!  
Place longer distances

<span id="page_1140">p. 1140</span>

Between our journey-stages":  
But they wronged themselves (therein).  
At length We made them  
As a tale (that is told),  
And We dispersed them  
All in scattered fragments.  
Verily in this are Signs  
For every (soul that is)  
Patiently constant and grateful.

20\. And on them did Satan  
Prove true his idea,  
And they followed him, all  
But a Party that believed.

21\. But he had no authority  
Over them,—except that We  
Might test the man who  
Believes in the Hereafter  
From him who is in doubt  
Concerning it: and thy Lord  
Doth watch over all things.

<span id="page_1141">p. 1141</span>

##### SECTION 3.

22\. Say: "Call upon other (gods)  
Whom ye fancy, besides God:  
They have no power,  
Not the weight of an atom,—  
In the heavens or on earth:  
No (sort of) share have they  
Therein, nor is any of them  
A helper to God.

23\. "No intercession can avail  
In His Presence, except for those  
For whom He has granted  
Permission. So far (is this  
The case) that, when terror  
Is removed from their hearts  
(At the Day of Judgment, then)  
Will they say, "What is it  
That your Lord commanded?"  
They will say, "That which is  
True and just; and He is  
The Most High, Most Great."

24\. Say: "Who gives you  
Sustenance, from the heavens

<span id="page_1142">p. 1142</span>

And the earth?" Say:  
"It is God; and certain it is  
That either we or ye  
Are on right guidance  
Or in manifest error!"

25\. Say: "Ye shall not be  
Questioned as to our sins,  
Nor shall we be questioned  
As to what ye do."

26\. Say: "Our Lord will gather us  
Together and will in the end  
Decide the matter between us  
(And you) in truth and justice:  
And He is the One to decide,  
The One Who knows all."

27\. Say: "Show me those whom  
Ye have joined with Him  
As partners: by no means  
(Can ye). Nay, He is God,  
The Exalted in Power,  
The Wise."

28\. We have not sent thee  
But as a universal (Messenger)

<span id="page_1143">p. 1143</span>

To men, giving them  
Glad tidings, and warning them  
(Against sin), but most men  
Understand not.

29\. They say: "When will this  
Promise (come to pass)  
If ye are telling the truth?"

30\. Say: "The appointment to you  
Is for a Day, which ye  
Cannot put back for an hour  
Nor put forward."

##### SECTION 4.

31\. The Unbelievers say:  
"We shall neither believe  
In this scripture nor in (any)  
That (came) before it."  
Couldst thou but see when  
The wrong-doers will be made  
To stand before their Lord,  
Throwing back the word (of blame)

<span id="page_1144">p. 1144</span>

On one another! Those who  
Had been despised will say  
To the arrogant ones:  
"Had it not been for you,  
We should certainly  
Have been believers!"

32\. The arrogant ones will say  
To those who had been despised:  
"Was it we who kept you  
Back from Guidance after  
It reached you? Nay, rather,  
It was ye who transgressed.

33\. Those who had been despised  
Will say to the arrogant ones:  
"Nay! it was a plot  
(Of yours) by day and by night:  
Behold! ye (constantly) ordered us  
To be ungrateful to God  
And to attribute equals to Him!  
They will declare (their) repentance  
When they see the Penalty:  
We shall put yokes

<span id="page_1145">p. 1145</span>

On the necks of the Unbelievers:  
It would only be a requital  
For their (ill) Deeds.

34\. Never did We send  
A Warner to a population,  
But the wealthy ones among them  
Said: "We believe not  
In the (Message) with which  
Ye have been sent."

35\. They said: "We have more  
In wealth and in sons  
And we cannot be punished."

36\. Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges  
And restricts the Provision  
To whom He pleases, but  
Most men understand not."

##### SECTION 5.

37\. It is not your wealth  
Nor your sons, that will  
Bring you nearer to Us  
In degree: but only  
Those who believe and work  
Righteousness—these are  
The ones for whom there is  
A multiplied Reward

<span id="page_1146">p. 1146</span>

For their deeds, while  
Secure they (reside)  
In the dwellings on high!

38\. Those who strive against  
Our Signs, to frustrate them,  
Will be given over  
Into Punishment.

39\. Say: "Verily my Lord enlarges  
And restricts the Sustenance  
To such of His servants  
As He pleases: and nothing  
Do ye spend in the least  
(In His Cause) but He  
Replaces it: for He is  
The Best of those who  
Grant Sustenance.

40\. One Day He will  
Gather them all together,  
And say to the angels,  
"Was it you that these  
Men used to worship?"

41\. They will say, "Glory to Thee!  
Our (tie) is with Thee  
As Protector—not with them.  
Nay, but they worshipped

<span id="page_1147">p. 1147</span>

The Jinns: most of them  
Believed in them."

42\. So on that Day  
No power shall they have  
Over each other, for profit  
Or harm: and We shall  
Say to the wrong-doers,  
"Taste ye the Penalty's  
Of the Fire,—the which  
Ye were wont to deny!"

43\. When Our Clear Signs  
Are rehearsed to them,  
They say, "This is only  
A man who wishes  
To hinder you from the (worship)  
Which your fathers practised."  
And they say, "This is  
Only a falsehood invented!"  
And the Unbelievers say  
Of the Truth when it comes  
To them, "This is nothing  
But evident magic!"

44\. But We had not given  
Them Books which they could  
Study, nor sent apostles  
To them before thee  
As Warners.

<span id="page_1148">p. 1148</span>

45\. And their predecessors rejected  
(The Truth); these have  
Not received a tenth  
Of what We had granted  
To those: yet when they rejected  
My apostles, how (terrible)  
Was My rejection (of them)!

##### SECTION 6.

46\. Say: "I do admonish you  
On one point: that ye  
Do stand up before God,—  
(It may be) in pairs,  
Or (it may be) singly,—  
And reflect (within yourselves):  
Your Companion is not  
Possessed: he is no less  
Than a Warner to you,  
In face of a terrible  
Penalty."

47\. Say: "No reward do I  
Ask of you: it is (all)  
In your interest: my reward  
Is only due from God:  
And He is Witness  
To all things."

48\. Say: "Verily my Lord  
Doth cast the (mantle

<span id="page_1149">p. 1149</span>

Of) Truth (over His servants),—  
He that has full knowledge  
Of (all) that is hidden."

49\. Say: "The Truth has arrived,  
And Falsehood neither creates  
Anything new, nor restores  
Anything."

50\. Say: "If I am astray,  
I only stray to the loss  
Of my own soul: but if  
I receive guidance, it is seen  
Because of the inspiration  
Of my Lord to me:  
It is He Who hears  
All things, and is (ever) near."

51\. If thou couldst but see  
When they will quake  
With terror; but then  
There will be no escape  
(For them), and they will he  
Seized from a position  
(Quite) near.

<span id="page_1150">p. 1150</span>

52\. And they will say,  
"We do believe (now)  
In the (Truth)"; but how  
Could they receive (Faith)  
From a position (so) far off,—

53\. Seeing that they did reject  
Faith (entirely) before, and  
That they (continually) cast  
(Slanders) on the Unseen  
From a position far off?

54\. And between them  
And their desires,  
Is placed a barrier,  
As was done in the past  
With their partisans:  
For they were indeed  
In suspicious (disquieting) doubt.
