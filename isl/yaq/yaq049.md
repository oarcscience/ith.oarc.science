### Sūra XLIX.

### *Ḥujurāt*, or the Inner Apartments.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. O ye who believe!  
Put not yourselves forward  
Before God and His Apostle;  
But fear God: for God  
Is He Who hears  
And knows all things.

2\. O ye who believe!  
Raise not your voices!  
Above the voice of the Prophet,  
Nor speak aloud to him  
In talk, as ye may  
Speak aloud to one another,  
Lest your deeds become!  
Vain and ye perceive not.

3\. Those that lower their voice  
In the presence of  
God's Apostle,—their hearts  
Has God tested for piety:  
For them is Forgiveness  
And a great Reward.

4\. Those who shout out  
To thee from without

<span id="page_1404">p. 1404</span>

The Inner Apartments—  
Most of them lack understanding.

5\. If only they had patience  
Until thou couldst  
Come out to them,  
It would be best  
For them: but God is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

6\. O ye who believe!  
If a wicked person comes  
To you with any news,  
Ascertain the truth, lest  
Ye harm people unwittingly,  
And afterwards become  
Full of repentance for  
What ye have done.

7\. And know that among you  
Is God's Apostle: were he,  
In many matters, to follow  
Your (wishes), ye would  
Certainly fall into misfortune:  
But God has endeared  
The Faith to you, and  
Has made it beautiful  
In your hearts, and He  
Has made hateful to you  
Unbelief, wickedness, and  
Rebellion: such indeed are  
Those who walk in righteousness;—

8\. A grace and favour  
From God; and God  
Is full of Knowledge  
And Wisdom.

<span id="page_1405">p. 1405</span>

9\. If two parties among  
The Believers fall into  
A quarrel, make ye peace  
Between them: but if  
One of them transgresses  
Beyond bounds against the other,  
Then fight ye (all) against  
The one that transgresses  
Until it complies with  
The command of God;  
But if it complies, then  
Make peace between them  
With justice, and be fair:  
For God loves those  
Who are fair (and just).

10\. The Believers are but  
A single Brotherhood:  
So make peace and  
Reconciliation between your  
Two (contending) brothers;  
And fear God, that ye  
May receive Mercy.

##### SECTION 2.

11\. O ye who believe!  
Let not some men  
Among you laugh at others:  
It may be that  
The (latter) are better  
Than the (former):  
Nor let some women  
Laugh at others:

<span id="page_1406">p. 1406</span>

It may be that  
The (latter) are better  
Than the (former):  
Nor defame nor be  
Sarcastic to each other,  
Nor call each other  
By (offensive) nicknames:  
Ill-seeming is a name  
Connoting wickedness,  
(To be used of one)  
After he has believed:  
And those who  
Do not desist are  
(Indeed) doing wrong.

12\. O ye who believe!  
Avoid suspicion as much  
(As possible): for suspicion  
In some cases is a sin:  
And spy not on each other,  
Nor speak ill of each other  
Behind their backs. Would any  
Of you like to eat  
The flesh of his dead  
Brother? Nay, ye would  
Abhor it… But fear God:  
For God is Oft-Returning,  
Most Merciful.

<span id="page_1407">p. 1407</span>

13\. O mankind! We created  
You from a single (pair)  
Of a male and a female,  
And made you into  
Nations and tribes, that  
Ye may know each other  
(Not that ye may despise  
(Each other). Verily  
The most honoured of you  
In the sight of God  
Is (he who is) the most  
Righteous of you.  
And God has full knowledge  
And is well acquainted  
(With all things).

14\. The desert Arabs say,  
"We believe." Say, ''Ye  
Have no faith; but ye  
(Only) say, "We have submitted  
Our wills to God,"  
For not yet has Faith  
Entered your hearts.  
But if ye obey God  
And His Apostle, He  
Will not belittle aught  
Of your deeds: for God  
Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

15\. Only those are Believers  
Who have believed in God  
And His Apostle, and have  
Never since doubted, but  
Have striven with their  
Belongings and their persons  
In the Cause of God:  
Such are the sincere ones.

<span id="page_1408">p. 1408</span>

16\. Say: "What! Will ye  
Instruct God about your  
Religion? But God knows  
All that is in the heavens  
And on earth: He has  
Full knowledge of all things.

17\. They impress on thee  
As favour that they  
Have embraced Islam.  
Say, "Count not your Islam  
As a favour upon me:  
Nay, God has conferred  
A favour upon you  
That He has guided you  
To the Faith, if ye  
Be true and sincere.

18\. "Verily God knows  
The secrets of the heavens  
And the earth: and God  
Sees well all  
That ye do."
