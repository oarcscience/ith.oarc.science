### Sūra LIV.

### *Qamar*, or the Moon.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*

1\. The Hour (of Judgment)  
Is nigh, and the moon  
Is cleft asunder.

2\. But if they see  
A Sign, they turn away,  
And say, "This is  
(But) transient magic."

3\. They reject (the warning)  
And follow their (own) lusts  
But every matter has  
Its appointed time.

4\. There have already come  
To them Recitals wherein  
There is (enough) to check (them),

5\. Mature wisdom;—but  
(The preaching of) Warners  
Profits them not.

<span id="page_1455">p. 1455</span>

6\. Therefore, (O Prophet,)  
Turn away from them.  
The Day that the Caller  
Will call (them)  
To a terrible affair,

7\. They will come forth,  
Their eyes humbled—  
From (their) graves, (torpid)  
Like locusts scattered abroad,

8\. Hastening, with eyes transfixed,  
Towards the Caller!—  
"Hard is this Day!",  
The Unbelievers will say.

9\. Before them the People  
Of Noah rejected (their apostle):  
They rejected Our servant,  
And said, "Here is  
One possessed!", and he  
Was driven out.

10\. Then he called on his Lord:  
"I am one overcome:  
Do Thou then help (me)!

11\. So We opened the gates  
Of heaven, with water  
Pouring forth.

<span id="page_1456">p. 1456</span>

12\. And We caused the earth  
To gush forth with springs.  
So the waters met (and rose)  
To the extent decreed.

13\. But We bore him  
On an (Ark) made of  
Broad planks and caulked  
With palm-fibre:

14\. She floats under our eyes  
(And care): a recompense  
To one who had been  
Rejected (with scorn)!

15\. And We have left  
This as a Sign  
(For all time): then  
Is there any that will  
Receive admonition?

16\. But how (terrible) was  
My Penalty and My Warning?

17\. And We have indeed  
Made the Qur-ān easy

<span id="page_1457">p. 1457</span>

To understand and remember:  
Then is there any that  
Will receive admonition?

18\. The ‘Ād (people) (too)  
Rejected (Truth): then  
How terrible was  
My Penalty and My Warning?

19\. For We sent against them  
A furious wind, on a Day  
Of violent Disaster,

20\. Plucking out men as if  
They were roots of palm-trees  
Torn up (from the ground).

21\. Yea, how (terrible) was  
My Penalty and My Warning!

22\. But We have indeed  
Made the Qur-ān easy  
To understand and remember:  
Then is there any that  
Will receive admonition?

##### SECTION 2.

23\. The Thamūd (also)  
Rejected (their) Warners.

24\. For they said: "What!  
A man! a solitary one

<span id="page_1458">p. 1458</span>

From among ourselves!  
Shall we follow such a one?  
Truly should we then be  
Straying in mind, and mad!

25\. "Is it that the Message  
Is sent to *him,*  
Of all people amongst us?  
Nay, he is a liar,  
An insolent one!"

26\. Ah! they will know  
On the morrow, which is  
The liar, the insolent one!

27\. For We will send  
The she-camel  
By way of trial for them.  
So watch them, (O Ṣāliḥ),  
And possess thyself in patience!

28\. And tell them that  
The water is to be  
Divided between them:  
Each one's right to drink  
Being brought forward  
(By suitable turns).

29\. But they called  
To their companion,  
And he took a sword  
In hand, and hamstrung (her).

30\. Ah! how (terrible) was  
My Penalty and My Warning!

<span id="page_1459">p. 1459</span>

31\. For We sent against them  
A single Mighty Blast,  
And they became  
Like the dry stubble used  
By one who pens cattle.

32\. And we have indeed  
Made the Qur-ān easy  
To understand and remember:  
Then is there any that  
Will receive admonition?

33\. The People of Lūṭ  
Rejected (his) Warning.

34\. We sent against them  
A violent tornado  
With showers of stones,  
(Which destroyed them), except  
Lūṭ's household: them We  
Delivered by early Dawn,—

35\. As a Grace from Us:  
Thus do We reward  
Those who give thanks.

36\. And (Lūṭ) did warn them  
Of Our Punishment, but  
They disputed about the Warning.

<span id="page_1460">p. 1460</span>

37\. And they even sought  
To snatch away his guests  
From him, but We blinded  
Their eyes. (They heard:)  
"Now taste ye My Wrath  
And My Warning."

38\. Early on the morrow  
An abiding Punishment  
Seized them:

39\. "So taste ye My Wrath  
And My Warning."

40\. And We have indeed  
Made the Qur-ān easy  
To understand and remember:  
Then is there any that  
Will receive admonition?

##### SECTION 3.

41\. To the People  
Of Pharaoh, too, aforetime,  
Came Warners (from God).

42\. The (people) rejected all  
Our Signs; but We  
Seized them with such Penalty  
(As comes) from One  
Exalted in Power,  
Able to carry out His Will.

<span id="page_1461">p. 1461</span>

43\. Are your Unbelievers,  
(O Quraish), better than they?  
Or have ye an immunity  
In the Sacred Books?

44\. Or do they say:  
"We acting together  
Can defend ourselves"?

45\. Soon will their multitude  
Be put to flight,  
And they will show  
Their backs.

46\. Nay, the Hour (of Judgment)  
Is the time promised them  
(For their full recompense):  
And that Hour will be  
Most grievous and most bitter.

47\. Truly those in sin  
Are the ones  
Straying in mind, and mad.

48\. The Day they will be  
Dragged through the Fire  
On their faces, (they  
Will hear:) "Taste ye  
The touch of Hell!"

<span id="page_1462">p. 1462</span>

49\. Verily, all things  
Have We created  
In proportion and measure.

50\. And Our Command  
Is but a single (Act),—  
Like the twinkling  
Of an eye.

51\. And (oft) in the past,  
Have We destroyed gangs  
Like unto you: then  
Is there any that  
Will receive admonition?

52\. All that they do  
Is noted in (their)  
Books (of Deeds):

<span id="page_1463">p. 1463</span>

53\. Every matter, small and great,  
Is on record.

54\. As to the Righteous,  
They will be in the midst  
Of Gardens and Rivers,

55\. In an Assembly of Truth,  
In the Presence of  
A Sovereign Omnipotent.
