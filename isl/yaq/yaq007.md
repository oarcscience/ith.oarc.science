### Sūra VII.

### A’rāf, or the Heights

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*

1\. Alif, Lām, Mīm, Ṣād.

2\. A Book revealed unto thee,—  
So let thy heart be oppressed'  
No more by any difficulty  
On that account,  
That with it thou mightest  
Warn (the erring) and teach  
The Believers.

3\. Follow (O men!) the revelation  
Given unto you from your Lord,  
And follow not, as friends  
Or protectors, other than Him.  
Little it is ye remember  
Of admonition.

4\. How many towns have We  
Destroyed (for their sins)?  
Our punishment took them  
On a sudden by night  
Or while they slept  
For their afternoon rest.

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

5\. When (thus) Our punishment  
Took them, no cry  
Did they utter but this:  
"Indeed we did wrong."

6\. When shall we question  
Those to whom Our Message  
Was sent and those by whom  
We sent it.

7\. And verily We shall recount  
Their whole story  
With knowledge, for We  
Were never absent  
(At any time or place).

8\. The balance that day  
Will be true (to a nicety):  
Those whose scale (of good)  
Will be heavy, will prosper:

9\. Those whose scale will be light,  
Will find their souls  
In perdition, for that they  
Wrongfully treated Our Signs.

10\. It is We Who have  
Placed you with authority  
On earth, and provided  
You therein with means  
For the fulfilment of your life:  
Small are the thanks  
That ye give!

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

##### SECTION 2.

11\. It is We Who created you  
And gave you shape;  
Then We bade the angels  
Bow down to Adam, and they  
Bowed down; not so Iblīs;  
He refused to be of those  
Who bow down.

12\. (God) said: "What prevented  
Thee from bowing down  
When I commanded thee?"  
He said: "I am better  
Than he: Thou didst create  
Me from fire, and him from clay."

13\. (God) said: "Get thee down  
From this: it is not  
For thee to be arrogant  
Here: get out, for thou  
Art of the meanest (of creatures)."

14\. He said: "Give me respite  
Till the day they are  
Raised up."

15\. (God) said: "Be thou  
Among those who have respite."

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

16\. He said: "Because thou  
Hast thrown me out  
Of the Way, lo! I will  
Lie in wait for them  
On Thy Straight Way:

17\. "Then will I assault them  
From before them and behind them,  
From their right and their left:  
Nor wilt Thou find,  
In most of them,  
Gratitude (for Thy mercies).

18\. (God) said: "Get out  
From this, disgraced  
And expelled. If any  
Of them follow thee,—  
Hell will I fill  
With you all.

19\. "O Adam! dwell thou  
And thy wife in the Garden,  
And enjoy (its good things)  
As ye wish: but approach not  
This tree, or ye run  
Into harm and transgression."

20\. Then began Satan to whisper  
Suggestions to them, bringing  
Openly before their minds  
All their shame

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

That was hidden from them  
(Before): he said: "Your Lord  
Only forbade you this tree,  
Lest ye should become angels  
Or such beings as live for ever."

21\. And he swore to them  
Both, that he was  
Their sincere adviser.

22\. So by deceit he brought about  
Their fall: when they  
Tasted of the tree,  
Their shame became manifest  
To them, and they began  
To sew together the leaves  
Of the Garden over their bodies.  
And their Lord called  
Unto them: "Did I not  
Forbid you that tree,  
And tell you that Satan  
Was an avowed  
Enemy unto you?"

23\. They said: "Our Lord!  
We have wronged our own souls:  
If Thou forgive us not  
And bestow not upon us  
Thy Mercy, we shall  
Certainly be lost."

24\. (God) said: "Get ye down,  
With enmity between yourselves.  
On earth will be your dwelling-place  
And your means of livelihood,—  
For a time."

25\. He said: "Therein shall ye  
Live, and therein shall ye  
Die; but from it shall ye  
Be taken out (at last)."

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

##### SECTION 3.

26\. O ye Children of Adam!  
We have bestowed raiment  
Upon you to cover  
Your shame, as well as  
To be an adornment to you.  
But the raiment of righteousness,—  
That is the best.  
Such are among the Signs  
Of God, that they  
May receive admonition!

27\. O ye Children of Adam!  
Let not Satan seduce you,  
In the same manner as  
He got your parents out  
Of the Garden, stripping them  
Of their raiment, to expose  
Their shame: for he  
And his tribe watch you  
From a position where ye  
Cannot see them: We made  
The Evil Ones friends  
(Only) to those without Faith.

28\. When they do aught  
That is shameful, they say:  
"We found our fathers  
Doing so"; and "God  
Commanded us thus":  
Say: "Nay, God never

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

Commands what is shameful:  
Do ye say of God  
What ye know not?"

29\. Say: "My Lord hath commanded  
Justice; and that ye set  
Your whole selves (to Him)  
At every time and place  
Of prayer, and call upon Him,  
Making your devotion sincere  
As in His sight:  
Such as He created you  
In the beginning, so  
Shall ye return."

30\. Some He hath guided:  
Others have (by their choice)  
Deserved the loss of their way;  
In that they took  
The Evil Ones, in preference  
To God, for their friends  
And protectors, and think  
That they receive guidance.

31\. O Children of Adam!  
Wear your beautiful apparel  
At every time and place  
Of prayer: eat and drink:  
But waste not by excess,  
For God loveth not the wasters.

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

##### SECTION 4.

32\. Say: Who hath forbidden  
The beautiful (gifts) of God,  
Which He hath produced  
For His servants,  
And the things, clean and pure,  
(Which He hath provided)  
For sustenance?  
Say: They are, in the life  
Of this world, for those  
Who believe, (and) purely  
For them on the Day  
Of Judgment. Thus do We  
Explain the Signs in detail  
For those who understand.

33\. Say: The things that my Lord  
Hath indeed forbidden are:  
Shameful deeds, whether open  
Or secret; sins and trespasses  
Against truth or reason; assigning  
Of partners to God, for which  
He hath given no authority;  
And saying things about God  
Of which ye have no knowledge.

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

34\. To every People is a term.  
Appointed: when their term  
Is reached, not an hour  
Can they cause delay,  
Nor (an hour) can they  
Advance (it in anticipation).

35\. O ye Children of Adam!  
Whenever there come to you  
Apostles from amongst you,  
Rehearsing My Signs unto you,  
Those who are righteous  
And mend (their lives),—  
On them shall be no fear  
Nor shall they grieve.

36\. But those who reject  
Our Signs and treat them  
With arrogance,—they  
Are Companions of the Fire,  
To dwell therein (for ever).

37\. Who is more unjust  
Than one who invents  
A lie against God  
Or rejects His Signs?  
For such, their portion  
Appointed must reach them  
From the Book (of Decrees):  
Until, when Our messengers  
(Of death) arrive and take  
Their souls, they say:  
"Where are the things  
That ye used to invoke  
Besides God?"  
They will reply, "They

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

Have left us in the lurch,"  
And they will bear witness  
Against themselves, that they  
Had rejected God.

38\. He will say: "Enter ye  
In the company of  
The Peoples who passed away  
Before you—men and Jinns,—  
Into the Fire. Every time  
A new People enters,  
It curses its sister-People  
(That went before), until  
They follow each other, all  
Into the Fire. Saith the last  
About the first: "Our Lord!  
It is these that misled us:  
So give them a double  
Penalty in the Fire."  
He will say: "Doubled  
For all": but this  
Ye do not understand.

39\. Then the first will say  
To the last: "See then!  
No advantage have ye  
Over us; so taste ye  
Of the Penalty for all  
That ye did!"

##### SECTION 5.

40\. To those who reject  
Our Signs and treat them  
With arrogance, no opening  
Will there be of the gates

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

Of heaven, nor will they  
Enter the Garden, until  
The camel can pass  
Through the eye of the needle:  
Such is Our reward  
For those in sin.

41\. For them there is  
Hell, as a couch  
(Below) and folds and folds  
Of covering above: such  
Is Our requital of those  
Who do wrong.

42\. But those who believe  
And work righteousness,—  
No burden do We place  
On any soul, but that  
Which it can bear,  
They will be Companions  
Of the Garden, therein  
To dwell (for ever).

43\. And We shall remove  
From their hearts any  
Lurking sense of injury;—  
Beneath them will be  
Rivers flowing;—and they  
Shall say: "Praise be, to God,  
Who hath guided us  
To this (felicity): never  
Could we have found  
Guidance, had it not been  
For the guidance of God:  
Indeed it was the truth.  
That the Apostles of our Lord  
Brought unto us." And they  
Shall hear the cry:  
"Behold! the Garden before you!

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

Ye have been made  
Its inheritors, for your  
Deeds (of righteousness)."

44\. The Companions of the Garden  
Will call out to the Companions  
Of the Fire: "We have  
Indeed found the promises  
Of our Lord to us true:  
Have you also found  
Your Lord's promises true?"  
They shall say, "Yes"; but  
A Crier shall proclaim  
Between them: "The curse  
Of God is on the wrong-doers;—

45\. "Those who would hinder (men)  
From the path of God  
And would seek in it  
Something crooked:  
They were those who  
Denied the Hereafter."

46\. Between them shall be  
A veil, and on the Heights

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

Will be men  
Who would know every one  
By his marks: they will call  
Out to the Companions  
Of the Garden, "Peace on you":  
They will not have entered,  
But they will have  
An assurance (thereof.)

47\. When their eyes shall be turned  
Towards the Companions  
Of the Fire, they will say:  
"Our Lord! send us not  
To the company  
Of the wrong-doers."

##### SECTION 6.

48\. The men on the Heights  
Will call to certain men  
Whom they will know  
From their m arks, saying:  
"Of what profit to you  
Were your hoards and your  
Arrogant ways?

49\. "Behold! are these not  
The men whom you swore  
That God with His Mercy  
Would never bless?  
Enter ye the Garden:  
No fear shall be on you,  
Nor shall ye grieve."

50\. The Companions of the Fire  
Will call to the Companions  
Of the Garden: "Pour down  
To us water or anything

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

That God doth provide  
For your sustenance."  
They will say: "Both  
These things hath God forbidden  
To those who rejected Him;—

51\. "Such as took their religion  
To be mere amusement  
And play, and were deceived  
By the life of the world."  
That day shall We forget them  
As they forgot the meeting  
Of this day of theirs,  
And as they were wont  
To reject Our Signs.

52\. For We had certainly  
Sent unto them a Book,  
Based on knowledge,  
Which We explained  
In detail,—a guide  
And a mercy  
To all who believe.

53\. Do they just wait  
For the final fulfilment  
Of the event? On the day  
The event is finally fulfilled,  
Those who disregarded it  
Before will say: "The apostles  
Of our Lord did indeed  
Bring true (tidings). Have we  
No intercessors now to intercede  
On our behalf? Or could we

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

Be sent back? Then should eve  
Behave differently from our  
Behaviour in the past."  
In fact they will have lost  
Their souls, and the things  
They invented will leave  
Them in the lurch.

##### SECTION 7.

54\. Your Guardian-Lord  
Is God, Who created  
The heavens and the earth  
In six Days, and is firmly  
Established on the Throne  
(Of authority): He draweth  
The night as a veil  
O'er the day, each seeking  
The other in rapid succession:  
He created the sun,  
The moon, and the stars,  
(All) governed by laws  
Under His Command.  
Is it not His to create  
And to govern? Blessed  
Be God, the Cherisher  
And Sustainer of the Worlds!

55\. Call on your Lord  
With humility and in private:

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

For God loveth not  
Those who trespass beyond bounds.

56\. Do no mischief on the earth,  
After it hath been  
Set in order, but call  
On Him with fear  
And longing (in your hearts):  
For the Mercy of God  
Is (always) near  
To those who do good.

57\. It is He Who sendeth  
The Winds like heralds  
Of glad tidings, going before  
His Mercy: when they have  
Carried the heavy-laden  
Clouds, We drive them  
To a land that is dead,  
Make rain to descend thereon,  
And produce every kind  
Of harvest therewith: thus  
Shall We raise up the dead:  
Perchance ye may remember.

58\. From the land that is clean  
And good, by the Will  
Of its Cherisher, springs up  
Produce, (rich) after its kind:

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

But from the land that is  
Bad, springs up nothing  
But that which is niggardly:  
Thus do we explain the Signs  
By various (symbols) to those  
Who are grateful.

##### SECTION 8.

59\. We sent Noah to his people.  
He said: "O my people!  
Worship God! ye have  
No other god but Him.  
I fear for you the Punishment  
Of a dreadful Day!

60\. The leaders of his people  
Said: "Ah! we see thee  
Evidently wandering (in mind)."

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

61\. He said: "O my people!  
No wandering is there  
In my (mind): on the contrary  
I am an apostle from  
The Lord and Cherisher  
Of the Worlds!

62."I but fulfil towards you  
The duties of my Lord's mission:  
Sincere is my advice to you,  
And I know from God  
Something that ye know not.

63\. "Do ye wonder that  
There hath come to you  
A message from your Lord,  
Through a man of your own  
People, to warn you,—  
So that ye may fear God  
And haply receive His Mercy?"

64\. But they rejected him,  
And We delivered him,  
And those with him,  
In the Ark:  
But We overwhelmed  
In the Flood those  
Who rejected Our Signs.  
They were indeed  
A blind people!

##### SECTION 9.

65\. To the ’Ad people,  
(We sent) Hūd, one

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

Of their (own) brethren:  
He said: "O my people!  
Worship God! ye have  
No other god but Him.  
Will ye not fear (God)?

66\. The leaders of the unbelievers  
Among his people said:  
"Ah! we see thou art  
An imbecile!" and "We think  
Thou art a liar!"

67\. He said: "O my people!  
I am no imbecile, but  
(I am) an apostle from  
The Lord and Cherisher  
Of the Worlds!

68\. "I but fulfil towards you  
The duties of my Lord's mission:  
I am to you a sincere  
And trustworthy adviser.

69\. "Do ye wonder that  
There hath come to you  
A message from your Lord  
Through a man of your own  
People, to warn you?  
Call in remembrance  
That He made you  
Inheritors after the people  
Of Noah, and gave you  
A stature tall among the nations.  
Call in remembrance  
The benefits (ye have received)  
From God: that so  
Ye may prosper."

70\. They said: "Comest thou  
To us, that we may worship  
God alone, and give up  
The cult of our fathers?  
Bring us what thou  
Threatenest us with,  
If so be that thou  
Tellest the truth!"

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

71\. He said: "Punishment  
And wrath have already  
Come upon you from your Lord  
Dispute ye with me  
Over names which ye  
Have devised—ye  
And your fathers,  
Without authority from God?  
Then wait: I am  
Amongst you, also waiting."

72\. We saved him and those  
Who adhered to him,  
By Our Mercy, and We  
Cut off the roots of those  
Who rejected Our Signs  
And did not believe.

##### SECTION 10.

73\. To the Thamūd people  
(We sent) Ṣaliḥ, one

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

Of their own brethren:  
He said: "O my people!  
Worship God; ye have  
No other god but Him.  
Now hath come unto you  
A clear (Sign) from your Lord!  
This she-camel of God  
Is a Sign unto you:  
So leave her to graze  
In God's earth, and let her  
Come to no harm,  
Or ye shall be seized  
With a grievous punishment.

74\. "And remember how He  
Made you inheritors  
After the ’Ad people  
And gave you habitations  
In the land: ye build  
For yourselves palaces and castles  
In (open) plains, and carve out  
Homes in the mountains;  
So bring to remembrance  
The benefits (ye have received)  
From God, and refrain  
From evil and mischief  
On the earth."

75\. The leaders of the arrogant  
Party among his people said

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

To those who were reckoned  
Powerless—those among them  
Who believed: "Know ye  
Indeed that Ṣaliḥ is  
An apostle from his Lord?"  
They said: "We do indeed  
Believe in the revelation  
Which hath been sent  
Through him."

76\. The arrogant party said:  
"For our part, we reject  
What ye believe in."

77\. Then they ham-strung  
The she-camel, and insolently  
Defied the order of their Lord,  
Saying: "O Ṣaliḥ! bring about  
Thy threats, if thou art  
An apostle (of God)!"

78\. So the earthquake took them  
Unawares, and they lay  
Prostrate in their homes  
In the morning!

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

79\. So Ṣaliḥ left them,  
Saying: "O my people!  
I did indeed convey to you  
The message for which  
I was sent by my Lord:  
I gave you good counsel,  
But ye love not good counsellors!"

80\. We also (sent) Lūṭ:  
He said to his people:  
"Do ye commit lewdness  
Such as no people  
In creation (ever) committed  
Before you?

81\. "For ye practise your lusts  
On men in preference  
To women: ye are indeed  
A people transgressing  
Beyond bounds."

82\. And his people gave  
No answer but this:  
They said, "Drive them out  
Of your city: these are

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

Indeed men who want  
To be clean and pure!"

83\. But we saved him  
And his family, except  
His wife: she was  
Of those who lagged behind

84\. And we rained down on them  
A shower (of brimstone):  
Then see what was the end  
Of those who indulged  
In sin and crime!

##### SECTION 11.

85\. To the Madyan people

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

We sent Shu‘aib, one  
Of their own brethren: he said:  
"O my people! worship God;  
Ye have no other god  
But Him. Now hath come  
Unto you a clear (Sign)  
From your Lord! Give just  
Measure and weight, nor withhold  
From the people the things  
That are their due; and do  
No mischief on the earth  
After it has been set  
In order: that will be best  
For you, if ye have Faith.

86\. "And squat not on every road,  
Breathing threats, hindering  
From the path of God  
Those who believe in Him,  
And seeking in it  
Something crooked;  
But remember how ye were  
Little, and He gave you increase.  
And hold in your mind's eye  
What was the end

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

Of those who did mischief.

87\. "And if there is a party  
Among you who believes  
In the Message with which  
I have been sent, and a party  
Which does not believe,  
Hold yourselves in patience  
Until God doth decide  
Between us: for He  
Is the best to decide."

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

88\. The leaders, the arrogant  
Party among his people, said:  
"O Shu’aib! we shall  
Certainly drive thee out  
Of our city—(thee) and those  
Who believe with thee;  
Or else ye (thou and they)  
Shall have to return  
To our ways and religion."  
He said: "What! even  
Though we do detest (them)?

89\. "We should indeed invent  
A lie against God,  
If we returned to your ways  
After God hath rescued  
Us therefrom; nor could we  
By any manner of means  
Return thereto unless it be  
As in the will and plan of God,  
Our Lord. Our Lord  
Can reach out to the utmost  
Recesses of things by His  
knowledge.  
In God is our trust.  
Our Lord! Decide thou  
Between us and our people

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

In truth, for thou  
Art the best to decide."

90\. The leaders, the Unbelievers  
Among his people, said:  
"If ye follow Shu’aib,  
Be sure then ye are ruined!"

91\. But the earthquake took them  
Unawares, and they lay  
Prostrate in their homes  
Before the morning!"

92\. The men who rejected  
Shu’aib became as if  
They had never been  
In the homes where they  
Had flourished: the men  
Who rejected Shu’aib—  
It was they who were ruined!

93\. So Shu’aib left them,  
Saying: "O my people!  
I did indeed convey to you  
The Messages for which  
I was sent by my Lord:  
I gave you good counsel,  
But how shall I lament

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

Over a people who refuse  
To believe!"

##### SECTION 12.

94\. Whenever We sent a prophet  
To a town, We took up  
Its people in suffering  
And adversity, in order  
That they might learn humility.

95\. Then We changed their suffering  
Into prosperity, until they grew  
And multiplied, and began  
To say: "Our fathers (too)  
Were touched by suffering  
And affluence"… Behold!  
We called them to account  
Of a sudden, while they  
Realised not (their peril).

96\. If the people of the towns  
Had but believed and feared  
God, We should indeed  
Have opened out to them

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

(All kinds of) blessings  
From heaven and earth;  
But they rejected (the truth),  
And We brought them  
To book for their misdeeds.

97\. Did the people of the towns  
Feel secure against the coming  
Of Our wrath by night  
While they were asleep?

98\. Or else did they feel  
Secure against its coming  
In broad daylight while they  
Played about (care-free)?

99\. Did they then feel secure  
Against the Plan of God?—  
But no one can feel  
Secure from the Plan  
Of God, except those  
(Doomed) to ruin!

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

##### SECTION 13.

100\. To those who inherit  
The earth in succession  
To its (previous) possessors,  
Is it not a guiding (lesson)  
That, if We so willed,  
We could punish them (too)  
For their sins, and seal up  
Their hearts so that they  
Could not hear?

101\. Such were the towns  
Whose story We (thus)  
Relate unto thee:  
There came indeed to them  
Their apostles with clear (Signs):  
But they would not believe  
What they had rejected before.  
Thus doth God seal up  
The hearts of those  
Who reject Faith.

102\. Most of them We found not  
Men (true) to their covenant:  
But most of them We found  
Rebellious and disobedient.

103\. Then after them We sent  
Moses with Our Signs  
To Pharaoh and his chiefs,  
But they wrongfully rejected them:  
So see what was the end  
Of those who made mischief.

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

104\. Moses said: "O Pharaoh!  
I am an apostle from  
The Lord of the Worlds,—

105\. One for whom it is right  
To say nothing but truth  
About God. Now have I  
Come unto you (people), from  
Your Lord, with a clear (Sign):  
So let the Children of Israel  
Depart along with me."

106\. (Pharaoh) said: "If indeed  
Thou hast come with a Sign,

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

Show it forth,  
If thou tellest the truth."

107\. Then (Moses) threw his rod,  
And behold! it was  
A serpent, plain (for all to see)!

108\. And he drew out his hand,  
And behold! it was white  
To all beholders!

##### SECTION 14.

109\. Said the Chiefs of the people  
Of Pharaoh: "This is indeed  
A sorcerer well-versed.

110\. "His plan is to get you out  
Of your land: then  
What is it ye counsel?"

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

111\. They said: "Keep him  
And his brother in suspense  
(For a while); and send  
To the cities men to collect—

112\. And bring up to thee  
All (our) sorcerers well-versed.

113\. So there came  
The sorcerers to Pharaoh:  
They said, "Of course  
We shall have a (suitable)  
Reward if we win!"

114\. He said: "Yea, (and more),—  
For ye shall in that case  
Be (raised to posts)  
Nearest (to my person)."

115\. They said: "O Moses!  
Wilt thou throw (first),  
Or shall we have  
The (first) throw?"

116\. Said Moses: "Throw ye (first)."  
So when they threw,  
They bewitched the eyes  
Of the people, and struck  
Terror into them: for they  
Showed a great (feat of) magic.

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

117\. We put it into Moses's mind  
By inspiration: "Throw (now)  
Thy rod": and behold!  
It swallows up straightway  
All the falsehoods  
Which they fake!

118\. Thus truth was confirmed.  
And all that they did  
Was made of no effect.

119\. So the (great ones) were vanquished  
There and then, and were  
Made to look small.

120\. But the sorcerers fell down  
Prostrate in adoration,

121\. Saying: "We believe  
In the Lord of the Worlds,—

122\. "The Lord of Moses and Aaron.

123\. Said Pharaoh: "Believe ye  
In Him before I give  
You permission? Surely  
This is a trick which ye  
Have planned in the City  
To drive out its people:  
But soon shall ye know  
(The consequences).

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

124\. "Be sure I will cut off  
Your hands and your feet  
On opposite sides, and I  
Will cause you all  
To die on the cross."

125\. They said: "For us,  
We are but sent back  
Unto our Lord:

126\. "But thou dost wreak  
Thy vengeance on us  
Simply because we believed  
In the Signs of our Lord  
When they reached us!  
Our Lord! pour out on us  
Patience and constancy, and take  
Our souls unto Thee  
As Muslims (who bow  
To Thy Will)!

##### SECTION 15.

127\. Said the chiefs of Pharaoh's  
People: "Wilt thou leave  
Moses and his people,  
To spread mischief in the land,  
And to abandon thee  
And thy gods?" He said:  
"Their male children will we  
Slay; (only) their females  
Will we save alive;  
And we have over them

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

(Power) irresistible."

128\. Said Moses to his people:  
"Pray for help from God,.  
And (wait) in patience and  
constancy:  
For the earth is God's,  
To give as a heritage  
To such of His servants  
As He pleaseth; and the end  
Is (best) for the righteous.

129\. They said: "We have had  
(Nothing but) trouble, both before  
And after thou camest  
To us." He said:  
"It may be that your Lord  
Will destroy your enemy  
And make you inheritors  
In the earth; that so  
He may try you  
By your deeds."

##### SECTION 16.

130\. We punished the people  
Of Pharaoh with years

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

(Of drought) and shortness  
Of crops; that they might  
Receive admonition.

131\. But when good (times) came,  
They said, "This is due  
To us;" when gripped  
By calamity, they ascribed it  
To evil omens connected  
With Moses and those with him!  
Behold! in truth the omens  
Of evil are theirs  
In God's sight, but most  
Of them do not understand!

132\. They said (to Moses):  
"Whatever be the Signs  
Thou bringest, to work  
Therewith thy sorcery on us,"  
We shall never believe  
In thee."

133\. So We sent (plagues) on them:  
Wholesale Death,  
Locusts, Lice, Frogs,  
And Blood: Signs openly  
Self-explained: but they  
Were steeped in arrogance,—  
A people given to sin.

134\. Every time the Penalty  
Fell on them, they said:

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

"O Moses! on our behalf  
Call on thy Lord in virtue  
Of his promise to thee:  
If thou wilt remove  
The Penalty from us,  
We shall truly believe in thee,  
And we shall send away  
The Children of Israel  
With thee."

135\. But every tune We removed  
The Penalty from them  
According to a fixed term  
Which they had to fulfil,—  
Behold! they broke their word!

136\. So We exacted retribution  
From them: We drowned them  
In the sea, because they  
Rejected Our Signs, and failed  
To take warning from them.

137\. And We made a people,  
Considered weak (and of no account),  
Inheritors of lands  
In both East and West,—

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

Lands whereon We sent  
Down Our blessings.  
The fair promise of thy Lord  
Was fulfilled for the Children  
Of Israel, because they had  
Patience and constancy,  
And We levelled to the ground  
The great Works and fine Buildings  
Which Pharaoh and his people  
Erected (with such pride).

138\. We took the Children of Israel  
(With safety) across the sea.  
They came upon a people  
Devoted entirely to some idols  
They had. They said:  
"O Moses! fashion for us  
A god like unto the gods  
They have." He said:

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

"Surely ye are a people  
Without knowledge.

139\. "As to these folk,—  
The cult they are in  
Is (but) a fragment of a ruin,  
And vain is the (worship)  
Which they practise."

140\. He said: "Shall I seek for you  
A god other than the (true)  
God, when it is God  
Who hath endowed you  
With gifts above the nations?"

141\. And remember We rescued you  
From Pharaoh's people,  
Who afflicted you with  
The worst of penalties,  
Who slew your male children  
And saved alive your females:  
In that was a momentous  
Trial from your Lord.

##### SECTION 17.

142\. We appointed for Moses  
Thirty nights, and completed  
(The period) with ten (more):  
Thus was completed the term  
(Of communion) with his Lord,  
Forty nights. And Moses  
Had charged his brother Aaron  
(Before he went up):

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

"Act for me amongst my people:  
Do right, and follow not  
The way of those  
Who do mischief."

143\. When Moses came  
To the place appointed by Us,  
And his Lord addressed him,  
He said: "O my Lord!  
Show (Thyself) to me,  
That I may look upon Thee."  
God said, "By no means  
Canst thou see Me (direct);  
But look upon the mount;  
If it abide  
In its place, then  
Shalt thou see Me."  
When his Lord manifested  
His glory on the Mount,  
He made it as dust,  
And Moses fell down  
In a swoon. When he  
Recovered his senses he said:  
"Glory be to Thee! To Thee  
I turn in repentance, and I  
Am the first to believe."

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

144\. (God) said: "O Moses!  
I have chosen thee  
Above (other) men,  
By the mission I (have  
Given thee) and the words  
I (have spoken to thee):  
Take then the (revelation)  
Which I give thee,  
And be of those  
Who give thanks."

145\. And We ordained laws  
For him in the Tablets  
In all matters, both  
Commanding and explaining  
All things, (and said):  
"Take and hold these  
With firmness, and enjoin  
Thy people to hold fast  
By the best in the precepts:  
Soon shall I show you  
The homes of the wicked,—  
(How they lie desolate)."

146\. Those who behave arrogantly  
On the earth in defiance

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

Of right—them will I  
Turn away from My Signs:  
Even if they see all the Signs,  
They will not believe in them;  
And if they see the way  
Of right conduct, they will  
Not adopt it as the Way;  
But if they see the way  
Of error, that is  
The Way they will adopt.  
For they have rejected  
Our Signs, and failed  
To take warning from them.

147\. Those who reject Our Signs  
And the Meeting in the Hereafter,—  
Vain are their deeds:  
Can they expect to be rewarded  
Except as they have wrought?

##### SECTION 18.

148\. The people of Moses made,  
In his absence, out of their ornaments,

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

The image of a calf,  
(for worship):  
It seemed to low: did they  
Not see that it could  
Neither speak to them, nor  
Show them the Way?  
They took it for worship  
And they did wrong.

149\. When they repented, and saw  
That they had erred,  
They said: "if our Lord  
Have not mercy upon us  
And forgive us, we shall  
Indeed be of those who perish."

150\. When Moses came back  
To his people, angry and grieved,  
He said: "Evil it is that ye  
Have done in my place  
In my absence: did ye  
Make haste to bring on  
The judgment of your Lord?"  
He put down the Tablets,

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

Seized his brother by (the hair  
Of) his head, and dragged him  
To him. Aaron said:  
"Son of my mother! The people  
Did indeed reckon me  
As naught, and went near  
To slaying me! Make not  
The enemies rejoice over  
My misfortune, nor count thou  
Me amongst the people  
Of sin."

151\. Moses prayed: "O my Lord!  
Forgive me and my brother!  
Admit us to Thy mercy!  
For Thou art the Most Merciful  
Of those who show mercy!"

##### SECTION 19.

152\. Those who took the calf  
(For worship) will indeed  
Be overwhelmed with wrath  
From their Lord, and with  
Shame in this life:  
Thus do We recompense  
Those who invent (falsehoods).

153\. But those who do wrong  
But repent thereafter and  
(Truly) believe,—verily  
Thy Lord is thereafter  
Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

154\. When the anger of Moses  
Was appeased, he took up  
The Tablets: in the writing  
Thereon was Guidance and Mercy  
For such as fear their Lord.

155\. And Moses chose seventy  
Of his people for Our place  
Of meeting: when they  
Were seized with violent quaking,  
He prayed: "O my Lord!  
If it had been Thy Will  
Thou couldst have destroyed,  
Long before, both them  
And me: wouldst Thou  
Destroy us for the deeds  
Of the foolish ones among us?  
This is no more than  
Thy trial: by it Thou causest  
Whom Thou wilt to stray,  
And Thou leadest whom  
Thou wilt into the right path.  
Thou art our Protector:  
So forgive us and give us  
Thy mercy; for Thou art  
The Best of those who forgive.

156\. "And ordain for us  
That which is good,  
In this life  
And in the Hereafter:  
For we have turned unto Thee."  
He said: "With My Punishment

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

I visit whom I will;  
But My Mercy extendeth  
To all things. That (Mercy)  
I shall ordain for those  
Who do right, and practise  
Regular charity, and those  
Who believe in Our Signs;—

157\. "Those who follow the Apostle,  
The unlettered Prophet,  
Whom they find mentioned  
In their own (Scriptures),—  
In the Law and the Gospel;—  
For he commands them  
What is just and forbids them  
What is evil; he allows  
Them as lawful what is good  
(And pure) and prohibits them  
From what is bad (and impure);  
He releases them  
From their heavy burdens  
And from the yokes  
That are upon them.  
So it is those who believe  
In him, honour him,  
Help him, and follow the Light  
Which is sent down with him,—

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

It is they who will prosper."

##### SECTION 20.

158\. Say: "O men! I am sent  
Unto you all, as the Apostle  
Of God, to Whom belongeth  
The dominion of the heavens  
And the earth: there is no god  
But He: it is He that giveth  
Both life and death. So believe  
In God and His Apostle,  
The unlettered Prophet,  
Who believeth in God  
And His Words: follow him  
That (so) ye may be guided."

159\. Of the people of Moses  
There is a section  
Who guide and do justice  
In the light of truth.

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

160\. We divided them into twelve Tribes  
Or nations. We directed  
Moses by inspiration,  
When his (thirsty) people asked  
Him for water: "Strike the rock  
With thy staff": out of it  
There gushed forth twelve springs:  
Each group knew its own place  
For water. We gave them  
The shade of clouds, and sent  
Down to them manna and quails,  
(Saying): "Eat of the good things  
We have provided for you":  
(But they rebelled); to Us  
They did no harm, but  
They harmed their own souls.

161\. And remember it was  
Said to them:  
"Dwell in this town  
And eat therein as ye wish,  
But say the word of humility  
And enter the gate  
In a posture of humility:  
We shall forgive you  
Your faults; We shall increase  
(The portion of) those who do good."

162\. But the transgressors among them  
Changed the word from that  
Which had been given them  
So we sent on them  
A plague from heaven.  
For that they repeatedly transgressed.

##### SECTION 21.

163\. Ask them concerning the town  
Standing close by the sea.  
Behold! they transgressed

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

In the matter of the Sabbath.  
For on the day of their Sabbath  
Their fish did come to them,  
Openly holding up their heads,  
But on the day they had  
No Sabbath, they came not:  
Thus did We make a trial  
Of them, for they were  
Given to transgression.

164\. When some of them said:  
"Why do ye preach  
To a people whom God  
Will destroy or visit  
With a terrible punishment?"—  
Said the preachers: "To discharge  
Our duty to your Lord,  
And perchance they may fear Him."

165\. When they disregarded the warnings  
That had been given them,  
We rescued those who forbade  
Evil; but We visited  
The wrong-doers with a  
Grievous [punishment](errata.htm#1), because  
They were given to transgression.

166\. When in their insolence  
They transgressed (all) prohibitions,  
We said to them:  
"Be ye apes,  
Despised and rejected."

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

167\. Behold! thy Lord did declare  
That He would send  
Against them, to the Day  
Of Judgment, those who would  
Afflict them with grievous  
Penalty. Thy Lord is quick  
In retribution, but He is also  
Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

168\. We broke them up  
Into sections on this earth.  
There are among them some  
That are the righteous, and some  
That are the opposite.  
We have tried them  
With both prosperity and adversity:  
In order that they  
Might turn (to Us).

169\. After them succeeded  
An (evil) generation: they  
Inherited the Book, but  
They chose (for themselves)  
The vanities of this world,  
Saying (for excuse): "(Everything)  
Will be forgiven us."  
(Even so), if similar vanities  
Came their way, they would  
(Again) seize them.  
Was not the Covenant  
Of the Book taken from them,  
That they would not  
Ascribe to God anything

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

But the truth? And they  
Study what is in the Book.  
But best for the righteous  
Is the Home in the Hereafter.  
Will ye not understand?

170\. As to those who hold fast  
By the Book and establish  
Regular Prayer,—never  
Shall we suffer the reward  
Of the righteous to perish.

171\. When We shook the Mount  
Over them, as if it had been  
A canopy, and they thought  
It was going to fall on them  
(We said): "Hold firmly  
To what We have given you,  
And bring (ever) to remembrance  
What is therein;  
Perchance ye may fear God."

##### SECTION 22.

172\. When thy Lord drew forth  
From the Children of Adam—

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

From their loins—  
Their descendants, and made them  
Testify concerning themselves, (saying):  
"Am I not your Lord  
(Who cherishes and sustains you)?"—  
They said: "Yea!  
We do testify!" (This), lest  
Ye should say on the Day  
Of Judgment: "Of this we  
Were never mindful":

173\. Or lest ye should say:  
"Our fathers before us  
May have taken false gods,  
But we are (their) descendants  
After them: wilt Thou then  
Destroy us because of the deeds  
Of men who were futile?"

174\. Thus do We explain  
The Signs in detail;  
And perchance they may turn  
(Unto Us).

175\. Relate to them the story  
Of the man to whom  
We sent Our Signs,  
But he passed them by:

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

So Satan followed him up,  
And he went astray.

176\. If it had been Our Will,  
We should have elevated him  
With Our Signs; but he  
Inclined to the earth,  
And followed his own vain desires.  
His similitude is that  
Of a dog: if you attack  
Him, he lolls out his tongue,  
Or if you leave him alone,  
He (still) lolls out his tongue.  
That is the similitude  
Of those who reject Our Signs;  
So relate the story;  
Perchance they may reflect.

177\. Evil as an example are  
People who reject Our Signs  
And wrong their own souls.

178\. Whom God doth guide,  
He is on the right path:  
Whom He rejects from His guidance,—  
Such are the persons who perish.

179\. Many are the Jinns and men  
We have made for Hell:  
They have hearts wherewith they  
Understand not, eyes wherewith

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

They see not, and ears wherewith  
They hear not. They are  
Like cattle,—nay more  
Misguided: for they  
Are heedless (of warning).

180\. The most beautiful names  
Belong to God:  
So call on him by them;  
But shun such men as  
Use profanity in His names:  
For what they do, they will  
Soon be requited.

181\. Of those We have created  
Are people who direct  
(Others) with truth.  
And dispense justice therewith,

##### SECTION 23.

182\. Those who reject Our Signs,  
We shall gradually visit  
With punishment, in ways  
They perceive not;

183\. Respite will I grant  
Unto them: for My scheme  
Is strong (and unfailing).

184\. Do they not reflect?  
Their Companion is not seized

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

With madness: he is but  
A perspicuous warner.

185\. Do they see nothing  
In the government of the heavens  
And the earth and all  
That God hath created?  
(Do they not see) that  
It may well be that  
Their term is nigh  
Drawing to an end?  
In what Message after this  
Will they then believe?

186\. To such as God rejects  
From His guidance, there can be  
No guide: He will  
Leave them in their trespasses,  
Wandering in distraction.

187\. Whey ask thee about  
The (final) Hour—when  
Will be its appointed time?  
Say: "The knowledge thereof  
Is with my Lord (alone):  
None but He can reveal  
As to when it will occur.  
Heavy were its burden through  
The heavens and the earth.  
Only, all of a sudden  
Will it come to you."  
They ask thee as if thou

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

Wert eager in search thereof:  
Say: "The knowledge thereof  
Is with God (alone),  
But most men know not."

188\. Say: "I have no power  
Over any good or harm  
To myself except as God  
Willeth. If I had knowledge  
Of the unseen, I should have  
Multiplied all good, and no evil  
Should have touched me:  
I am but a warner,  
And a bringer of glad tidings  
To those who have faith."

##### SECTION 24.

189\. It is He Who created  
You from a single person,  
And made his mate  
Of like nature, in order  
That he might dwell with her  
(In love). When they are  
United, she bears a light  
Burden and carries it about  
(Unnoticed). When she grows  
Heavy, they both pray  
To God their Lord, (saying):  
"If Thou givest us  
A goodly child,

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

We vow we shall  
(Ever) be grateful."

190\. But when He giveth them  
A goodly child, they ascribe  
To others a share in the gift  
They have received:  
But God is exalted  
High above the partners  
They ascribe to Him.

191\. Do they indeed ascribe  
To Him as partners things  
That can create nothing,  
But are themselves created?

192\. No aid can they give them,  
Nor can they aid themselves!

193\. If ye call them to guidance,  
They will not obey:  
For you it is the same  
Whether ye call them  
Or ye hold your peace!

194\. Verily those whom ye  
Call upon besides God  
Are servants like unto you:  
Call upon them, and let them  
Listen to your prayer,  
If ye are (indeed) truthful!

195\. Have they feet to walk with?  
Or hands to lay hold with?

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

Or eyes to see with?  
Or ears to hear with?  
Say: "Call your 'god-partners',  
Scheme (your worst) against me,  
And give me no respite!

196\. "For my Protector is God,  
Who revealed the Book  
(From time to time),  
And He will choose  
And befriend the righteous.

197\. "But those ye call upon  
Besides Him, are unable  
To help you, and indeed  
To help themselves."

198\. If thou callest them  
To guidance, they hear not.  
Thou wilt see them  
Looking at thee, but  
They see not.

199\. Hold to forgiveness;  
Command what is right;  
But turn away from the ignorant.

200\. If a suggestion from Satan  
Assail thy (mind)

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

Seek refuge with God;  
For He heareth and knoweth  
(All things).

201\. Those who fear God,  
When a thought of evil  
From Satan assaults them,  
Bring God to remembrance,  
When lo! they see (aright)!

202\. But their brethren (the evil ones)  
Plunge them deeper into error,  
And never relax (their efforts).

203\. If thou bring them not  
A revelation, they say:  
"Why hast thou not  
Got it together?"  
Say: "I but follow  
What is revealed to me  
From my Lord:  
This is (nothing but)  
Lights from your Lord,  
And Guidance, and Mercy,  
For any who have Faith."

204\. When the Qur-ān is read,  
Listen to it with attention,

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

And hold your peace:  
That ye may receive Mercy.

205\. And do thou (O reader!)  
Bring thy Lord to remembrance  
In thy (very) soul,  
With humility and in reverence,  
Without loudness in words,  
In the mornings and evenings;  
And be not thou  
Of those who are unheedful.

206\. Those who are near  
To thy Lord, disdain not  
To do Him worship:  
They celebrate His praises,  
And bow down before Him.
