### Sūra XXVI.

### *Shu‘arāa*, or The Poets.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. *Tā*. *Sīn*. *Mīm*.

2\. These are Verses of the Book  
That makes (things) clear.

3\. It may be thou frettest  
Thy soul with grief, that they  
Do not become Believers.

4\. If (such) were Our Will,  
We could send down to them  
From the sky a Sign,  
To which they would bend  
Their necks in humility.

5\. But there comes not  
To them a newly-revealed  
Message from (God) Most Gracious,  
But they turn away therefrom.

<span id="page_947">p. 947</span>

6\. They have indeed rejected  
(The Message): so they will  
Know soon (enough) the truth  
Of what they mocked at!

7\. Do they not look  
At the earth,—how many  
Noble things of all kinds  
We have produced therein?

8\. Verily, in this is a Sign:  
But most of them  
Do not believe.

9\. And verily, thy Lord  
Is He, the Exalted in Might,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 2.

10\. Behold, thy Lord called  
Moses: "Go to the people  
Of iniquity,—

11\. "The people of Pharaoh:  
Will they not fear God?"

12\. He said: "O my Lord!  
I do fear that they  
Will charge me with falsehood:

<span id="page_948">p. 948</span>

13\. "My breast will be straitened?'  
And my speech may not go  
(Smoothly): so send unto Aaron.

14\. "And (further), they have  
A charge of crime against me;  
And I fear they may  
Slay me."

15\. God said: "By no means!  
Proceed then, both of you,  
With Our Signs; We  
Are with you, and will  
Listen (to your call).

16\. "So go forth, both of you,  
To Pharaoh, and say:  
'We have been sent  
By the Lord and Cherisher  
Of the Worlds;

17\. "'Send thou with us  
The Children of Israel.'"

18\. (Pharaoh) said: "Did we not  
Cherish thee as a child  
Among us, and didst thou not  
Stay in our midst  
Many years of thy life?

<span id="page_949">p. 949</span>

19\. "And thou didst a deed  
Of thine which (thou knowest)  
Thou didst, and thou art  
An ungrateful (wretch)!"

20\. Moses said: "I did it  
Then, when I was  
In error.

21\. "So I fled from you (all)  
When I feared you;  
But my Lord has (since)  
Invested me with judgment  
(And wisdom) and appointed me  
As one of the apostles.

22\. "And this is the favour  
With which thou dost  
Reproach me,—that thou  
Hast enslaved the Children  
Of Israel!"

23\. Pharaoh said: "And what  
Is the 'Lord and Cherisher  
Of the Worlds'?

<span id="page_950">p. 950</span>

24\. (Moses) said: "The Lord  
And Cherisher of the heavens  
And the earth, and all between,  
If ye want to be  
Quite sure."

25\. (Pharaoh) said to those  
Around: "Do ye not listen  
(To what he says)?

26\. (Moses) said: "Your Lord  
And the Lord of your fathers  
From the beginning!"

27\. (Pharaoh) said: "Truly  
Your apostle who has been  
Sent to you is  
A veritable madman!"

28\. (Moses) said: "Lord of the East  
And the West, and all between!  
If ye only had sense!"

29\. (Pharaoh) said: "If thou  
Dost put forward any god  
Other than me, I will  
Certainly put thee in prison!"

30\. (Moses) said: "Even if I  
Showed you something  
Clear (and) convincing?"

<span id="page_951">p. 951</span>

31\. (Pharaoh) said: "Show it then,  
If thou tellest the truth!"

32\. So (Moses) threw his rod,  
And behold, it was  
A serpent, plain (for all to see)!

33\. And he drew out his hand,  
And behold, it was white  
To all beholders!

##### SECTION 3.

34\. (Pharaoh) said to the Chiefs  
Around him: "This is indeed  
A sorcerer well-versed:

35\. "His plan is to get you out  
Of your land by his sorcery;  
Then what is it ye counsel?"

36\. They said: "Keep him  
And his brother in suspense  
(For a while), and dispatch  
To the Cities heralds to collect—

37\. "And bring up to thee  
All (our) sorcerers well-versed."

38\. So the sorcerers were got  
Together for the appointment  
Of a day well-known,

39\. And the people were told:  
"Are ye (now) assembled?—

40\. "That we may follow  
The sorcerers (in religion)  
If they win?"

<span id="page_952">p. 952</span>

41\. So when the sorcerers arrived,  
They said to Pharaoh:  
"Of course—shall we have  
A (suitable) reward  
If we win?"

42\. He said: "Yea, (and more),—  
For ye shall in that case  
Be (raised to posts)  
Nearest (to my person)."

43\. Moses said to them:  
"Throw ye—that which  
Ye are about to throw!"

44\. So they threw their ropes  
And their rods, and said:  
"By the might of Pharaoh,  
It is we who will  
Certainly win!"

45\. Then Moses threw his rod,  
When, behold, it straightway  
Swallows up all  
The falsehoods which they fake!

46\. When did the sorcerers  
Fall down, prostrate in adoration,

47\. Saying: "We believe  
In the Lord of the Worlds,

48\. "The Lord of Moses and Aaron."

<span id="page_953">p. 953</span>

49\. Said (Pharaoh): "Believe ye  
In Him before I give  
You permission? Surely he  
Is your leader, who has  
Taught you sorcery!  
But soon shall ye know!

50\. "Be sure I will cut off  
Your hands and your feet  
On opposite sides, and I  
Will cause you all  
To die on the cross!"

51\. They said: "No matter!  
For us, we shall but  
Return to our Lord!

52\. "Only, our desire is  
That our Lord will  
Forgive us our faults,  
That we may become  
Foremost among the Believers!"

##### SECTION 4.

53\. By inspiration We told Moses:  
"Travel by night with  
My servants; for surely  
Ye shall be pursued."

54\. Then Pharaoh sent heralds  
To (all) the Cities,

<span id="page_954">p. 954</span>

55\. (Saying): "These (Israelites)  
Are but a small band,

56\. "And they are raging  
Furiously against us;

57\. "But we are a multitude  
Amply fore-warned."

58\. So We expelled them  
From gardens, springs,

59\. Treasures, and every kind  
Of honourable position;

60\. Thus it was, but  
We made the Children  
Of Israel inheritors  
Of such things.

61\. So they pursued them  
At sunrise.

62\. And when the two bodies  
Saw each other, the people  
Of Moses said: "We are  
Sure to be overtaken."

63\. (Moses) said: "By no means!  
My Lord is with me!  
Soon will He guide me!"

<span id="page_955">p. 955</span>

64\. Then We told Moses  
By inspiration: "Strike  
The sea with thy rod."  
So it divided, and each  
Separate part became  
Like the huge, firm mass  
Of a mountain.

65\. And We made the other  
Party approach thither.

66\. We delivered Moses and all  
Who were with him;

67\. But We drowned the others.

68\. Verily in this is a Sign:  
But most of them  
Do not believe.

69\. And verily thy Lord  
Is He, the Exalted in Might,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 5.

70\. And rehearse to them  
(Something of) Abraham's story.

<span id="page_956">p. 956</span>

71\. Behold, he said  
To his father and his people:  
"What worship ye?"

72\. They said: "We worship  
Idols, and we remain constantly  
In attendance on them."

73\. He said: "Do they listen  
To you when ye call (on them),  
Or do you good or harm?"

74\. They said: "Nay, but we  
Found our fathers doing  
Thus (what we do)."

75\. He said: "Do ye then  
See whom ye have been  
Worshipping,—

76\. "Ye and your fathers before you?—

77\. "For they are enemies to me;  
Not so the Lord and Cherisher  
Of the Worlds;

78\. "Who created me, and  
It is He who guides me;

79\. "Who gives me food and drink,

80\. "And when I am ill,  
It is He who cures me;

81\. "Who will cause me to die,  
And then to live (again);

<span id="page_957">p. 957</span>

82\. "And who, I hope,  
Will forgive me my faults  
On the Day of Judgment.

83\. "O my Lord! bestow wisdom  
On me, and join me  
With the righteous;

84\. "Grant me honourable mention  
On the tongue of truth  
Among the latest (generations);

85\. "Make me one of the inheritors  
Of the Garden of Bliss;

86\. "Forgive my father, for that  
He is among those astray;

87\. "And let me not be  
In disgrace on the Day  
When (men) will be raised up;—

88\. "The Day whereon neither  
Wealth nor sons will avail,

89\. "But only he (will prosper)  
That brings to God  
A sound heart;

90\. "To the righteous, the Garden  
Will be brought near,

<span id="page_958">p. 958</span>

91\. "And to those straying in Evil,  
The Fire will be placed  
In full view;

92\. "And it shall be said  
To them, 'Where are  
The (gods) ye worshipped—

93\. "'Besides God? Can they  
Help you or help themselves?'

94\. "Then they will be thrown  
Headlong into the (Fire),—  
They and those straying  
In Evil,

95\. "And the whole hosts  
Of Iblīs together.

96\. "They will say there  
In their mutual bickerings:

97\. "'By God, we were truly  
In an error manifest,

98\. "'When we held you as equals  
With the Lord of the Worlds;

99\. "'And our seducers were  
Only those who were  
Steeped in guilt.

100\. "'Now, then, we have none  
To intercede (for us),

<span id="page_959">p. 959</span>

101\. "'Nor a single friend  
To feel (for us).

102\. "'Now if we only had  
A chance of return,  
We shall truly be  
Of those who believe!'"

103\. Verily in this is a Sign  
But most of them  
Do not believe.

104\. And verily thy Lord  
Is He, the Exalted in Might,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 6.

105\. The people of Noah rejected  
The apostles.

106\. Behold, their brother Noah  
Said to them: "Will ye not  
Fear (God)?

107\. "I am to you an apostle  
Worthy of all trust:

108\. "So fear God, and obey me.

109\. "No reward do I ask  
Of you for it: my reward  
Is only from the Lord  
Of the Worlds:

<span id="page_960">p. 960</span>

110\. "So fear God, and obey me."

111\. They said: "Shall we  
Believe in thee when it is  
The meanest that follow thee?"

112\. He said: "And what  
Do I know as to  
What they do?

113\. "Their account is only  
With my Lord, if ye  
Could (but) understand.

114\. "I am not one to drive away  
Those who believe.

115\. "I am sent only  
To warn plainly in public."

116\. They said: "If thou  
Desist not, O Noah!  
Thou shalt be stoned  
(to death)."

117\. He said: "O my Lord!  
Truly my people have  
Rejected me.

118\. "Judge thou, then, between me  
And them openly, and deliver

<span id="page_961">p. 961</span>

Me and those of the Believers  
Who are with me."

119\. So We delivered him  
And those with him,  
In the Ark filled  
(With all creatures).

120\. Thereafter We drowned those  
Who remained behind.

121\. Verily in this is a Sign:  
But most of them  
Do not believe.

122\. And verily thy Lord  
Is He, the Exalted in Might,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 7.

123\. The ’Ad (people) rejected'  
The apostles.

124\. Behold, their brother Hūd  
Said to them: "Will ye not  
Fear (God)?

<span id="page_962">p. 962</span>

125\. "I am to you an apostle  
Worthy of all trust:

126\. "So fear God and obey me.

127\. "No reward do I ask  
Of you for it my reward  
Is only from the Lord  
Of the Worlds.

128\. "Do ye build a landmark  
On every high place  
To amuse yourselves?

129\. "And do ye get for yourselves  
Fine buildings in the hope  
Of living therein (for ever)?

130\. "And when ye exert  
Your strong hand,  
Do ye do it like men  
Of absolute power?

131\. "Now fear God, and obey me.

132\. "Yea, fear Him Who  
Has bestowed on you  
Freely all that ye know.

133\. "Freely has He bestowed  
On you cattle and sons,—

<span id="page_963">p. 963</span>

134\. "And Gardens and Springs.

135\. "Truly I fear for you  
The Penalty of a Great Day."

136\. They said: "It is the same  
To us whether thou  
Admonish us or be not  
Among (our) admonishers!

137\. "This is no other than  
A customary device  
Of the ancients,

138\. "And we are not the ones  
To receive Pains and Penalties!"

139\. So they rejected him,  
And We destroyed them.  
Verily in this is a Sign:  
But most of them  
Do not believe.

140\. And verily thy Lord  
Is He, the Exalted in Might,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 8.

141\. The <u>Th</u>amūd (people) rejected  
The apostles.

<span id="page_964">p. 964</span>

142\. Behold, their brother Ṣāliḥ  
Said to them: "Will you not  
Fear (God)?

143\. "I am to you an apostle  
Worthy of all trust.

144\. "So fear God, and obey me.

145\. "No reward do I ask  
Of you for it: my reward  
Is only from the Lord  
Of the Worlds.

146\. "Will ye be left secure,  
In (the enjoyment of) all  
That ye have here?—

147\. "Gardens and Springs,

148\. "And corn-fields and date palms  
With spathes near breaking  
(With the weight of fruit)?

149\. "And ye carve houses  
Out of (rocky) mountains  
With great skill.

150\. "But fear God and obey me;

151\. "And follow not the bidding  
Of those who are extravagant,—

152\. "Who make mischief in the land,  
And mend not (their ways)."

153\. Whey said: "Thou art only  
One of those bewitched!'

<span id="page_965">p. 965</span>

154\. "Thou art no more than  
A mortal like us:  
Then bring us a Sign,  
If thou tellest the truth!"

155\. He said: "Here is  
A she-camel: she has  
A right of watering,  
And ye have a right  
Of watering, (severally)  
On a day appointed.

156\. "Touch her not with harm,  
Lest the Penalty  
Of a Great Day  
Seize you."

157\. But they ham-strung her:  
Then did they become  
Full of regrets.

158\. But the Penalty seized them.  
Verily in this is a Sign:  
But most of them  
Do not believe.

159\. And verily thy Lord  
Is He, the Exalted in Might,  
Most Merciful.

<span id="page_966">p. 966</span>

##### SECTION 9

160\. The people of Lūt rejected'  
The apostles.

161\. Behold, their brother Lūt  
Said to them: "Will ye not  
Fear (God)?

162\. "I am to you an apostle  
Worthy of all trust.

163\. "So fear God and obey me.

164\. "No reward do I ask  
Of you for it my reward  
Is only from the Lord  
Of the Worlds.

165\. "Of all the creatures  
In the world, will ye  
Approach males,

166\. "And leave those whom God  
Has created for you  
To be your mates?  
Nay, ye are a people  
Transgressing (all limits)!"

167\. Whey said: "If thou desist not,  
O Lūt! thou wilt assuredly  
Be cast out!"

168\. He said: "I do detest  
Your doings:"

<span id="page_967">p. 967</span>

169\. "O my Lord! deliver me  
And my family from  
Such things as they do!"

170\. So We delivered him  
And his family,—all

171\. Except an old woman  
Who lingered behind.

172\. But the rest We destroyed Utterly.

173\. We rained down on them  
A shower (of brimstone):  
And evil was the shower  
On those who were admonished  
(But heeded not)!

174\. Verily in this is a Sign  
But most of them  
Do not believe.

175\. And verily thy Lord  
Is He, the Exalted in Might  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 10.

176\. The Companions of the Wood  
Rejected the apostles.

177\. Behold, Shu‘aib said to them:  
Will ye not fear (God)?

178\. "I am to you an apostle  
Worthy of all trust.

<span id="page_968">p. 968</span>

179\. "So fear God and obey me.

180\. "No reward do I ask  
Of you for it: my, reward  
Is only from the Lord  
Of the Worlds.

181\. "Give just measure,''  
And cause no loss  
(To others by fraud).

182\. "And weigh with scales  
True and upright.

183\. "And withhold not things  
Justly due to men,  
Nor do evil in the land,  
Working mischief.

184\. "And fear Him Who created  
You and (Who created)  
The generations before (you)"

185\. Whey said: "Thou art only  
One of those bewitched!

186\. "Thou art no more than  
A mortal like us,  
And indeed we think  
Thou art a liar!

187\. "Now cause a piece  
Of the sky to fall on us,  
If thou art truthful!"

188\. He said: "My Lord  
Knows best what ye do."

<span id="page_969">p. 969</span>

189\. But they rejected him.  
Then the punishment  
Of a day of overshadowing gloom  
Seized them, and that was  
The Penalty of a Great Day.

190\. Verily in that is a Sign:  
But most of them  
Do not believe.

191\. And verily thy Lord  
Is He, the Exalted in Might,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 11.

192\. Verily this is a Revelation  
From the Lord of the Worlds:

193\. With it came down  
The Spirit of Faith and Truth—

<span id="page_970">p. 970</span>

194\. To thy heart and mind,  
That thou mayest admonish

195\. In the perspicuous  
Arabic tongue.

196\. Without doubt it is (announced)  
In the mystic Book  
Of former peoples.

197\. Is it not a Sign  
To them that the Learned  
Of the Children of Israel  
Knew it (as true)?

198\. Had We revealed it  
To any of the non Arabs,

199\. And had he recited it  
To them, they would not  
Have believed in it.

200\. Thus have We caused it  
To enter the hearts  
Of the Sinners.

<span id="page_971">p. 971</span>

201\. They will not believe  
In it until they see  
The grievous Penalty;

202\. But the (Penalty) will come  
To them of a sudden,  
While they preceive it not;

203\. Then they will say:  
"Shall we be respited?"

204\. Do they then ask  
For Our Penalty to be  
Hastened on?

205\. Seest thou? If We do  
Let them enjoy (this life)  
For a few years,

206\. Yet there comes to them  
At length the (Punishment)  
Which they were promised!

207\. It will profit them not  
That they enjoyed (this life)!

208\. Never did We destroy  
A population, but had  
Its warners—

209\. By way of reminder;  
And We never are unjust.

210\. No evil ones have brought  
Down this (Revelation):

<span id="page_972">p. 972</span>

211\. It would neither suit them  
Nor would they be able  
(To produce it).

212\. Indeed they have been removed  
Far from even (a chance of)  
Hearing it.

213\. So call not on any  
Other god with God,  
Or thou wilt be among  
Those under the Penalty.

214\. And admonish thy nearest  
Kinsmen,

215\. And lower thy wing  
To the Believers who  
Follow thee.

216\. Then if they disobey thee,  
Say: "I am free (of responsibility)  
For what ye do!"

217\. And put thy trust  
On the Exalted in Might,  
The Merciful,—

218\. Who seeth thee standing  
Forth (in prayer),

219\. And thy movements among  
Those who prostrate themselves.

<span id="page_973">p. 973</span>

220\. For it is He  
Who heareth and knoweth  
All things.

221\. Shall I inform you.  
(O people!), on whom it is  
That the evil ones descend?

222\. They descend on every  
Lying, wicked person,

223\. (Into whose ears) they pour  
Hearsay vanities, and most  
Of them are liars.

224\. And the Poets,—  
It is those straying in Evil,  
Who follow them:

225\. Seest thou not that they  
Wander distracted in every  
Valley?—

226\. And that they say  
What they practise not?—

227\. Except those who believe,  
Work righteousness, engage much

<span id="page_974">p. 974</span>

In the remembrance of God,  
And defend themselves only after  
They are unjustly attacked.  
And soon will the unjust'  
Assailants know what vicissitudes  
Their affairs will take!
