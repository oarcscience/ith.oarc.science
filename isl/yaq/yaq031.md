### Sūra XXXI.

### Luqmān (the Wise).

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. A. L. M.

2\. These are Verses  
Of the Wise Book,—

3\. A Guide and a Mercy  
To the Doers of Good,—

4\. Those who establish regular Prayer,  
And give regular Charity,  
And have (in their hearts)  
The assurance of the Hereafter.

5\. These are on (true) guidance  
From their Lord; and these  
Are the ones who will prosper.

6\. But there are, among men,  
Those who purchase idle tales,'

<span id="page_1081">p. 1081</span>

Without knowledge (or meaning),  
To mislead (men) from the Path  
Of God and throw ridicule  
(On the Path): for such  
There will be a humiliating  
Penalty.

7\. When Our Signs are rehearsed  
To such a one, he turns  
Away in arrogance, as if  
He heard them not, as if  
There were deafness in both  
His ears: announce to him  
A grievous Penalty.

8\. For those who believe  
And work righteous deeds,  
There will be Gardens  
Of Bliss,—

9\. To dwell therein. The promise  
Of God is true: and He  
Is Exalted in power, Wise.

10\. He created the heavens  
Without any pillars that ye  
Can see; He set  
On the earth mountains  
Standing firm, lest it  
Should shake with you;  
And He scattered through it  
Beasts of all kinds.  
We send down rain  
From the sky, and produce

<span id="page_1082">p. 1082</span>

On the earth every kind.  
Of noble creature, in pairs.

11\. Such is the Creation of God:  
Now show Me what is there  
That others besides Him  
Have created: nay, but  
The Transgressors are  
In manifest error.

##### SECTION 2.

12\. We bestowed (in the past)  
Wisdom on Luqmān:  
"Show (thy) gratitude to God."  
Any who is (so) grateful  
Does so to the profit  
Of his own soul: but if  
Any is ungrateful, verily  
God is free of all wants,  
Worthy of all praise.

13\. Behold, Luqmān said  
To his son by way of

<span id="page_1083">p. 1083</span>

Instruction: "O my son!  
Join not in worship  
(Others) with God: for  
False worship is indeed  
The highest wrong-doing."

14\. And We have enjoined on man  
(To be good) to his parents:  
In travail upon travail  
Did his mother bear him,  
And in years twain  
Was his weaning: (hear  
The command), "Show gratitude  
To Me and to thy parents:  
To Me is (thy final) Goal.

15\. "But if they strive  
To make thee join  
In worship with Me  
Things of which thou hast  
No knowledge, obey them not;  
Yet bear them company  
In this life with justice  
(And consideration), and follow  
The way of those who  
Turn to Me (in love):  
In the End the return  
Of you all is to Me,  
And I will tell you  
The truth (and meaning)  
Of all that ye did."

<span id="page_1084">p. 1084</span>

16\. "O my son!" (said Luqmān),  
"If there be (but) the weight  
Of a mustard-seed and  
It were (hidden) in a rock,'  
Or (anywhere) in the heavens or  
On earth, God will bring it  
Forth: for God understands'  
The finest mysteries, (and)  
Is well-acquainted (with them).

17\. "O my son! establish  
Regular prayer, enjoin what is  
Just, and forbid what is wrong:  
And bear with patient constancy  
Whate’er betide thee; for this  
Is firmness (of purpose)  
In (the conduct of) affairs.

18\. "And swell not thy cheek  
(For pride) at men,  
Nor walk in insolence  
Through the earth;  
For God loveth not  
Any arrogant boaster.

19\. "And be moderate  
In thy pace, and lower

<span id="page_1085">p. 1085</span>

Thy voice; for the harshest  
Of sounds without doubt  
Is the braying of the ass."

##### SECTION 3.

20\. Do ye not see  
That God has subjected  
To your (use) all things  
In the heavens and on earth,  
And has made His bounties  
Flow to you in exceeding  
Measure, (both) seen and unseen?  
Yet there are among men  
Those who dispute about God,  
Without knowledge and without  
Guidance, and without a Book  
To enlighten them!

21\. When they are told to follow  
The (Revelation) that God  
Has sent down, they say:  
"Nay, we shall follow  
The ways that we found  
Our fathers (following)."

<span id="page_1086">p. 1086</span>

What! even if it is  
Satan beckoning them  
To the Penalty  
Of the (Blazing) Fire?

22\. Whoever submits  
His whole self to God,  
And is a doer of good,  
Has grasped indeed  
The most trustworthy hand-hold  
And with God rests the End  
And Decision of (all) affairs.

23\. But if any reject Faith,  
Let not his rejection  
Grieve thee: to Us  
Is their Return, and We  
Shall tell them the truth  
Of their deeds: for God  
Knows well all that is  
In (men's) hearts.

24\. We grant them their pleasure  
For a little while  
In the end shall We  
Drive them to  
A chastisement unrelenting.

25\. If thou ask them,  
Who it is that created  
The heavens and the earth.  
They will certainly say,

<span id="page_1087">p. 1087</span>

"God". Say: "Praise be to God!"  
But most of them  
Understand not.

26\. To God belong all things  
In heaven and earth: verily  
God is He (that is)  
Free of all wants,  
Worthy of all praise.

27\. And if all the trees  
On earth were pens  
And the Ocean (were ink),  
With seven Oceans behind it  
To add to its (supply),  
Yet would not the Words  
Of God be exhausted  
(In the writing): for God  
Is Exalted in power,  
Full of Wisdom.

28\. And your creation  
Or your resurrection  
Is in no wise but  
As an individual soul:  
For God is He Who  
Hears and sees (all things).

<span id="page_1088">p. 1088</span>

29\. Seest thou not that  
God merges Night into Day  
And He merges Day into Night;  
That He has subjected the sun,  
And the moon (to His Law),  
Each running its course  
For a term appointed; and  
That God is well acquainted  
With all that ye do?

30\. That is because God is  
The (only) Reality, and because  
Whatever else they invoke  
Besides Him is Falsehood;  
And because God,—He is  
The Most High, Most Great.

##### SECTION 4.

31\. Seest thou not that  
The ships sail through  
The Ocean by the grace  
Of God?—that He may  
Show you of His Signs?  
Verily in this are Signs  
For all who constantly persevere  
And give thanks.

32\. When a wave covers them  
Like the canopy (of clouds),  
They call to God  
Offering Him sincere devotion.

<span id="page_1089">p. 1089</span>

But when He has delivered them  
Safely to land, there are  
Among them those that halt  
Between (right and wrong).  
But none reject Our Signs  
Except only a perfidious  
Ungrateful (wretch)!

33\. O mankind! do your duty  
To your Lord, and fear  
(The coming of) a Day  
When no father can avail  
Aught for his son, nor  
A son avail aught  
For his father.  
Verily, the promise of God  
Is true: let not then  
This present life deceive you,  
Nor let the Chief Deceiver  
Deceive you about God.

34, Verily the knowledge  
Of the Hour is  
With God (alone).  
It is He Who sends down  
Rain, and He Who knows  
What is in the wombs.

<span id="page_1090">p. 1090</span>

Nor does any one know  
What it is that he will  
Earn on the morrow:  
Nor does any one know  
In what land he is  
To die. Verily with God  
Is full knowledge and He  
Is acquainted (with all things)
