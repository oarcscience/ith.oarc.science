### Sūra XVII.

### *Banī Isrā-īl,* or the Children of Israel,

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Glory to (God)  
Who did take His Servant  
For a Journey by night  
From the Sacred Mosque  
To the Farthest Mosque,  
Whose precincts We did  
Bless,—in order that We  
Might show him some  
Of Our Signs: for He  
Is the One Who heareth  
And seeth (all things).

2\. We gave Moses the Book,  
And made it a Guide

<span id="page_694">p. 694</span>

To the Children of Israel,  
(Commanding): "Take not  
Other than Me  
As Disposer of (your) affairs."

3\. O ye that are sprung  
From those whom We carried  
(In the Ark) with Noah!  
Verily he was a devotee  
Most grateful.

4\. And We gave (clear) warning  
To the Children of Israel  
In the Book, that twice  
Would they do mischief  
On the earth and be elated  
With mighty arrogance  
(And twice would they be punished)!

5\. When the first of the warnings  
Came to pass, We sent  
Against you Our servants  
Given to terrible warfare:  
They entered the very inmost  
Parts of your homes;  
And it was a warning  
(Completely) fulfilled.

<span id="page_695">p. 695</span>

6\. Then did We grant you  
The Return as against them:  
We gave you increase  
In resources and sons,  
And made you  
The more numerous  
In man-power.

7\. If ye did well,  
Ye did well for yourselves;  
If ye did evil,  
(Ye did it) against yourselves?  
So when the second  
Of the warnings came to pass,  
(We permitted your enemies)  
To disfigure your faces,  
And to enter your Temple  
As they had entered it before,  
And to visit with destruction  
All that fell into their power.

8\. It may be that your Lord  
May (yet) show Mercy

<span id="page_696">p. 696</span>

Unto you; but if ye  
Revert (to your sins),  
We shall revert  
(To Our punishments):  
And We have made Hell  
A prison for those who  
Reject (all Faith),

9\. Verily this Qur-ān  
Doth guide to that  
Which is most right (or stable),  
And giveth the glad tidings  
To the Believers who work  
Deeds of righteousness,  
That they shall have  
A magnificent reward;

10\. And to those who believe not  
In the Hereafter, (it announceth)  
That We have prepared  
For them a Penalty  
Grievous (indeed).

##### SECTION 2.

11\. The prayer that man  
Should make for good,  
He maketh for evil;  
For man is given to  
Hasty (deeds).

12\. We have made the Night  
And the Day as two

<span id="page_697">p. 697</span>

(Of Our) Signs: the Sign  
Of the Night have We obscured,  
While the Sign of the Day  
We have made to enlighten  
You; that ye may seek  
Bounty from your Lord,  
And that ye may know  
The number and count  
Of the years: all things  
Have We explained in detail.

13\. Every man's fate  
We have fastened  
On his own neck:  
On the Day of Judgment  
We shall bring out  
For him a scroll,  
Which he will see  
Spread open.

14\. (It will be said to him:)  
"Read thine (own) record:  
Sufficient is thy soul  
This day to make out  
An account against thee."

<span id="page_698">p. 698</span>

15\. Who receiveth guidance,  
Receiveth it for his own  
Benefit: who goeth astray  
Doth so to his own loss:  
No bearer of burdens  
Can bear the burden  
Of another: nor would We  
Visit with Our Wrath  
Until We had sent  
An apostle (to give warning).

16\. When We decide to destroy  
A population, We (first) send  
A definite order to those  
Among them who are given  
The good things of this life  
And yet transgress; so that  
The word is proved true  
Against them: then (it is)  
We destroy them utterly.

17\. How many generations  
Have We destroyed. after Noah?  
And enough is thy Lord  
To note and see  
The sins of His servants

<span id="page_699">p. 699</span>

18\. If any do wish  
For the transitory things  
(Of this life), We readily  
Grant them—such things  
As We will, to such persons  
As We will: in the end  
Have We provided Hell  
For them: they will burn  
Therein, disgraced and rejected.

19\. Those who do wish  
For the (things of) the  
Hereafter,  
And strive therefor  
With all due striving,  
And have Faith,—  
They are the ones  
Whose striving is acceptable  
(To God).

20\. Of the bounties of thy Lord  
We bestow freely on all—  
These as well as those:  
The bounties of thy Lord  
Are not closed (to anyone).

21\. See how We have bestowed  
More on some than on others;  
But verily the Hereafter  
Is more in rank and gradation

<span id="page_700">p. 700</span>

And more in excellence.

22\. Take not with God  
Another object of worship;  
Or thou (O man!) wilt sit  
In disgrace and destitution.'

##### SECTION 3.

23\. Why Lord hath decreed  
That ye worship hone but Him,  
And that ye be kind  
To parents. Whether one  
Or both of them attain  
Old age in thy life,  
Say not to them a word  
Of contempt, nor repel them,  
But address them  
In terms of honour.

<span id="page_701">p. 701</span>

24\. And, out of kindness,  
Lower to them the wing  
Of humility, and say:  
"My Lord! bestow on them  
Thy Mercy even as they  
Cherished me in childhood.

25\. Your Lord knoweth best  
What is in your hearts:  
If ye do deeds of righteousness,  
Verily He is Most Forgiving  
To those who turn to Him  
Again and again  
(in true penitence).

26\. And render to the kindred  
Their due rights, as (also)  
To those in want,  
And to the wayfarer:  
But squander not (your wealth)  
In the manner of a spendthrift.

<span id="page_702">p. 702</span>

27\. Verily spendthrifts are brothers  
Of the Evil Ones;  
And the Evil One  
Is to his Lord (Himself)  
Ungrateful.

28\. And even if thou hast  
To turn away from them  
In pursuit of the Mercy  
From thy Lord which thou  
Dost expect, yet speak  
To them a word  
Of easy kindness.

29\. Make not thy hand tied  
(Like a niggard's) to thy neck,  
Nor stretch it forth  
To its utmost reach,  
So that thou become  
Blameworthy and destitute.

30\. Verily thy Lord doth provide  
Sustenance in abundance  
For whom He pleaseth, and He  
Provideth in a just measure.  
For He doth know  
And regard all His servants.

<span id="page_703">p. 703</span>

##### SECTION 4.

31\. Kill not your children  
For fear of want: We shall  
Provide sustenance for them  
As well as for you.  
Verily the killing of them  
Is a great sin.

32\. Nor come nigh to adultery:  
For it is a shameful (deed)  
And an evil, opening the road  
(To other evils).

33\. Nor take life—which God  
Has made sacred—except  
For just cause. And if  
Anyone is slain wrongfully,  
We have given his heir  
Authority (to demand Qiṣāṣ  
Or to forgive): but let him  
Not exceed bounds in the matter  
Of taking life; for he  
Is helped (by the Law).

34\. Come not nigh  
To the orphan's property  
Except to improve it,

<span id="page_704">p. 704</span>

Until he attains the age  
Of full strength; and fulfil  
(Every) engagement,  
For (every) engagement  
Will be enquired into  
(On the Day of Reckoning).

35\. Give full measure when ye  
Measure, and weigh  
With a balance that is straight:  
That is the most fitting  
And the most advantageous  
In the final determination:

36\. And pursue not that  
Of which thou hast  
No knowledge; for  
Every act of hearing,  
Or of seeing  
Or of (feeling in) the heart  
Will be enquired into  
(On the Day of Reckoning).

37\. Nor walk on the earth  
With insolence: for thou

<span id="page_705">p. 705</span>

Canst not rend the earth  
Asunder, nor reach  
The mountains in height.

38\. Of all such things  
The evil is hateful  
In the sight of thy Lord.

39\. These are among the (precepts  
Of) wisdom, which thy Lord  
Has revealed to thee.  
Take not, with God,  
Another object of worship,  
Lest thou shouldst be thrown  
Into Hell, blameworthy and rejected.

40\. Has then your Lord,  
(O Pagans!) preferred for you  
Sons, and taken for Himself  
Daughters among the angels?  
Truly ye utter  
A most dreadful saying!

<span id="page_706">p. 706</span>

##### SECTION 5.

41\. We have explained (things)  
In various (ways) in this Qur-ān,  
In order that they may receive  
Admonition, but it only increases  
Their flight (from the Truth)!

42\. Say: if there had been  
(Other) gods with Him,—  
As they say,—behold,  
They would certainly have  
Sought out a way  
To the Lord of the Throne!

43\. Glory to Him! He is high  
Above all that they say!—  
Exalted and Great (beyond measure)!

44\. The seven heavens and the earth,  
And all beings therein,  
Declare His glory:  
There is not a thing  
But celebrates His praise;  
And yet ye understand not  
How they declare His glory!  
Verily He is Oft-Forbearing,  
Most Forgiving!

45\. When thou dost recite  
The Qur-ān, We put,

<span id="page_707">p. 707</span>

Between thee and those who  
Believe not to the Hereafter,  
A veil invisible:

46\. And We put coverings  
Over their hearts (and minds)  
Lest they should understand  
The Our-ān, and deafness  
Into their ears: when thou  
Dost commemorate thy Lord—  
And Him alone—in the Qur-ān,  
They turn on their backs,  
Fleeing (from the Truth).

47\. We know best why it is  
They listen, when they listen  
To thee; and when they  
Meet in private conference,  
Behold, the wicked say,  
"Ye follow none other than  
A man bewitched!"

48\. See what similes they strike  
For thee: but they have gone  
Astray, and never can they  
Find a way.

49\. They say: "What!  
When we are reduced

<span id="page_708">p. 708</span>

To bones and dust,  
Should we really be raised up  
(To be) a new creation?

50\. Say: "(Nay!) be ye  
Stones or iron,

51\. "Or created matter  
Which, in your minds,  
Is hardest (to be raised up),  
(Yet shall ye be raised up)!"  
Then will they say:  
"Who will cause us  
To return?" Say: "He  
Who created you first!"  
Then will they wag  
Their heads towards thee,  
And say, "When will  
That be?" Say, "May be  
It will be quite soon!

52\. "It will be on a Day  
When He will call you,  
And ye will answer  
(His call) with (words  
Of) His praise, and ye  
Will think that ye tarried  
But a little while!

<span id="page_709">p. 709</span>

##### SECTION 6.

53\. Say to My servants  
That they should (only) say  
Those things that are best:  
For Satan doth sow  
Dissensions among them:  
For Satan is to man  
An avowed enemy.

54\. It is your Lord  
That knoweth you best:  
If He please, He granteth  
You mercy, or if He please,  
Punishment: We have not sent  
Thee to be a disposer  
Of their affairs for them.

55\. And it is your Lord  
That knoweth best all beings  
That are in the heavens  
And on earth: We  
Did bestow on some Prophets  
More (and other) gifts  
Than on others: and We gave  
To David (the gift  
Of) the Psalms.

<span id="page_710">p. 710</span>

56\. Say: "Call on those—  
Besides Him—whom ye fancy:  
They have neither the power  
To remove your troubles  
From you nor to change them."

57\. Those whom they call upon  
Do desire (for themselves) means  
Of access to their Lord,—  
Even those who are nearest:  
They hope for His Mercy  
And fear His Wrath:  
For the Wrath of thy Lord  
Is something to take heed of

58\. There is not a population  
But We shall destroy it  
Before the Day of Judgment  
Or punish it with  
A dreadful Penalty:  
That is written  
In the (eternal) Record.

59\. And We refrain from sending  
The Signs, only because  
The men of former generations  
Treated them as false:

<span id="page_711">p. 711</span>

We sent the She-camel  
To the <u>Th</u>amūd to open  
Their eyes, but they  
Treated her wrongfully:  
We only send the Signs  
By way of terror  
(And warning from evil).

60\. Behold! We told thee  
That thy Lord doth encompass  
Mankind round about:  
We granted the Vision  
Which We showed thee,  
But as a trial for men,—  
As also the Cursed Tree  
(Mentioned) in the Qur-ān:  
We put terror (and warning)  
Into them, but it only  
Increases their inordinate  
transgression!

<span id="page_712">p. 712</span>

##### SECTION 7.

61\. Behold! We said to the angels:  
"Bow down unto Adam":  
They bowed down except Iblīs  
He said, "Shall I bow down  
To one whom Thou didst create  
From clay?"

62\. He said, "Seest Thou? This is  
The one whom Thou hast honoured  
Above me! If Thou wilt but  
Respite me to the Day  
Of Judgment, I will surely  
Bring his descendants  
Under my sway  
All but a few!"

63\. (God) said: "Go thy way;  
If any of them follow thee,  
Verily Hell will be  
The recompense of you (all)—  
An ample recompense.

<span id="page_713">p. 713</span>

64\. "Lead to destruction those  
Whom thou canst among them,  
With thy (seductive) voice;  
Make assaults on them  
With thy cavalry and thy  
Infantry; mutually share  
With them wealth and children;  
And make promises to them."  
But Satan promises them  
Nothing but deceit.

65\. "As for My servants,  
No authority shalt thou  
Have over them:"  
Enough is thy Lord  
For a Disposer of affairs.

66\. Your Lord is He  
That maketh the Ship  
Go smoothly for you  
Through the sea, in order that  
Ye may seek of His Bounty.  
For He is unto you  
Most Merciful.

67\. When distress seizes you  
At sea, those that ye  
Call upon—besides Himself—  
Leave you in the lurch!  
But when He brings you back  
Safe to land, ye turn

<span id="page_714">p. 714</span>

Away (from Him). Most ungrateful  
Is man!

68\. Do ye then feel secure  
That He will not cause you  
To be swallowed up  
Beneath the earth  
When ye are on land,  
Or that He will not send  
Against you a violent tornado  
(With showers of stones)  
So that ye shall find  
No one to carry out  
Your affairs for you?

69\. Or do ye feel secure  
That He will not send you  
Back a second time  
To sea and send against you  
A heavy gale to drown you  
Because of your ingratitude,  
So that ye find no helper  
Therein against Us?

70\. We have honoured the sons  
Of Adam; provided them  
With transport on land and sea;  
Given them for sustenance things  
Good and pure; and conferred  
On them special favours,  
Above a great part  
Of Our Creation.

<span id="page_715">p. 715</span>

##### SECTION 8.

71\. One day We shall call  
Together all human beings  
With their (respective) Imāms:  
Those who are given their record  
In their right hand  
Will read it (with pleasure),  
And they will not be  
Dealt with unjustly  
In the least.

72\. But those who were blind  
In this world, will he  
Blind in the Hereafter,  
And most astray  
From the Path.

73\. And their purpose was  
To tempt thee away  
From that which We  
Had revealed unto thee,  
To substitute in Our name  
Something quite different:  
(In that case), behold!  
They would certainly have  
Made thee (their) friend!

74\. And had We not  
Given thee strength,

<span id="page_716">p. 716</span>

Thou wouldst nearly  
Have inclined to them  
A little.

75\. In that case We should  
Have made thee taste  
An equal portion (of punishment)  
In this life, and an equal portion  
In death: and moreover  
Thou wouldst have found  
None to help thee against Us!

76\. Their purpose was to scare  
Thee off the land,  
In order to expel thee;  
But in that case they  
Would not have stayed  
(Therein) after thee,  
Except for a little while.

77\. (This was Our) way  
With the apostles We sent  
Before thee: thou wilt find  
No change in Our ways.

##### SECTION 9.

78\. Establish regular prayers—  
At the sun's decline

<span id="page_717">p. 717</span>

Till the darkness of the night,  
And the morning prayer  
And reading: for the prayer  
And reading in the morning  
Carry their testimony.

79\. And pray in the small watches  
Of the morning: (it would be)  
An additional prayer  
(Or spiritual profit)  
For thee: soon will thy Lord  
Raise thee to a Station  
Of Praise and Glory!

80\. Say: "O my Lord!  
Let my entry be  
By the Gate of Truth  
And Honour, and likewise  
My exit by the Gate  
Of Truth and Honour;  
And grant me  
From Thy Presence  
An authority to aid (me).

<span id="page_718">p. 718</span>

81\. And say: "Truth has (now)  
Arrived, and Falsehood perished:  
For Falsehood is (by its nature)  
Bound to perish."

82\. We send down (stage by stage)  
In the Qur-ān that which  
Is a healing and a mercy  
To those who believe:  
To the unjust it causes  
Nothing but loss after loss.

83\. Yet when We bestow  
Our favours on man,  
He turns away and becomes  
Remote on his side (instead  
Of coming to Us), and when  
Evil seizes him he  
Gives himself up to despair!

84\. Say: "Everyone acts  
According to his own disposition:  
But your Lord knows best  
Who it is that is  
Best guided on the Way."

<span id="page_719">p. 719</span>

##### SECTION 10.

85\. They ask thee concerning  
The Spirit (of inspiration).  
Say: "The Spirit (cometh)  
By command of my Lord:  
Of knowledge it is only  
A little that is communicated  
To you, (O men!)"

86\. If it were Our Will,  
We could take away  
That which We have  
Sent thee by inspiration  
Then wouldst thou find  
None to plead thy affair  
In that matter as against Us,—

87\. Except for Mercy from thy Lord:  
For His Bounty is  
To thee (indeed) great.

88\. Say: "If the whole  
Of mankind and Jinns  
Were to gather together  
To produce the like  
Of this Qur-ān, they  
Could not produce  
The like thereof, even if  
They backed up each other

<span id="page_720">p. 720</span>

With help and support.

89\. And We have explained  
To man, in this Qur-ān,  
Every kind of similitude:  
Yet the greater part of men  
Refuse (to receive it)  
Except with ingratitude!

90\. They say: "We shall not  
Believe in thee, until thou  
Cause a spring to gush  
Forth for us from the earth,

91\. "Or (until) thou have  
A garden of date trees  
And vines, and cause rivers  
To gush forth in their midst,  
Carrying abundant water;

92\. "Or thou cause the sky  
To fall in pieces, as thou  
Sayest (will happen), against us;

<span id="page_721">p. 721</span>

Or thou bring God  
And the angels before (us)  
Face to face;

93\. "Or thou have a house  
Adorned with gold,  
Or thou mount a ladder  
Right into the skies.  
No, we shall not even believe  
In thy mounting until thou  
Send down to us a book  
That we could read."  
Say: "Glory to my Lord!  
Am I aught but a man,—  
An apostle?"

##### SECTION 11.

94\. What kept men back  
From Belief when Guidance  
Came to them, was nothing  
But this: they said,  
"Has God sent a man  
(Like us) to be (His) Apostle?"

95\. Say, "If there were settled,  
On earth, angels walking about

<span id="page_722">p. 722</span>

In peace and quiet, We should  
Certainly have sent them  
Down from the heavens  
An angel for an apostle."

96\. Say: "Enough is God  
For a witness between me  
And you: for He is  
Well acquainted with His servants,  
And He sees (all things).

97\. It is he whom God guides,  
That is on true guidance;  
But he whom He leaves  
Astray—for such wilt thou  
Find no protector besides Him.  
On the Day of Judgment  
We shall gather them together,  
Prone on their faces,  
Blind, dumb, and deaf:  
Their abode will be Hell:  
Every time it shows abatement,  
We shall increase for them  
The fierceness of the Fire.

98\. That is their recompense,  
Because they rejected Our Signs,  
And said, "When we are reduced  
To bones and broken dust,  
Should we really be raised up  
(To be) a new Creation?"

<span id="page_723">p. 723</span>

99\. See they not that God,  
Who created the heavens  
And the earth, has power  
To create the like of them  
(Anew)? Only He has  
Decreed a term appointed,  
Of which there is no doubt.  
But the unjust refuse  
(To receive it) except  
With ingratitude.

100\. Say: "If ye had  
Control of the Treasures  
Of the Mercy of my Lord,  
Behold, ye would keep them  
Back, for fear of spending  
Them: for man  
Is (ever) niggardly!"

##### SECTION 12

101\. To Moses We did give  
Nine Clear Signs:  
Ask the Children of Israel:  
When he came to them,  
Pharaoh said to him:  
"O Moses! I consider thee,

<span id="page_724">p. 724</span>

Indeed, to have been  
Worked upon by sorcery!

102\. Moses said, "Thou knowest  
Well that these things  
Have been sent down by none  
But the Lord of the heavens  
And the earth as eye-opening  
Evidence: and I consider thee  
Indeed, O Pharaoh, to be  
One doomed to destruction!"

103\. So he resolved to remove them  
From the face of the earth:  
But We did drown him  
And all who were with him.

104\. And We said thereafter  
To the Children of Israel,  
"Dwell securely in the land  
(Of promise)": but when  
The second of the warnings came  
To pass, We gathered you  
Together in a mingled crowd

105\. We sent down the (Qur-ān)  
In Truth, and in Truth  
Has it descended: and We sent  
Thee but to give Glad  
Tidings and to warn (sinners).

106\. (It is) a Qur-ān  
Which We have divided  
(Into parts from time to time),  
In order that thou mightest  
Recite it to men  
At intervals: We have  
Revealed it by stages.

107\. Say: "Whether ye believe  
In it or not, it is true  
That those who were given  
Knowledge beforehand, when  
It it recited to them,  
Fall down on their faces  
In humble prostration,

108\. "And they say, "Glory  
To our Lord! Truly  
Has the promise of our Lord  
Been fulfilled!"

109\. They fall down on their faces  
In tears, and it increases  
Their (earnest) humility!

110\. Say: "Call upon God, or  
Call upon Raḥmān:  
By whatever name ye call  
Upon Him, (it is well):  
For to Him belong  
The Most Beautiful Names.  
Neither speak thy Prayer aloud,  
Nor speak it in a low tone,  
But seek a middle course  
Between."

111\. Say: "Praise be to God,  
Who begets no son,  
And has no partner  
In (His) dominion:  
Nor (needs) He any  
To protect Him from  
humiliation:  
Yea, magnify Him  
For His greatness and glory!"
