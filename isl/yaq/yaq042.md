### Sūra XLII.

### *Shūrā*, or Consultation.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Hā-Mīm;*

2\. *‘Ain*. *Sīn*. *Kāf*.

3\. Thus doth (He) send  
Inspiration to thee  
As (He did) to those before thee,—  
God, Exalted in Power,  
Full of Wisdom.

4\. To Him belongs all  
That is in the heavens  
And on earth: and He  
Is Most High, Most Great.

5\. The heavens are almost  
Rent asunder from above them  
(By His Glory):  
And the angels celebrate  
The Praises of their Lord,  
And pray for forgiveness  
For (all) beings on earth:  
Behold! Verily God is He,

<span id="page_1306">p. 1306</span>

The Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

6\. And those who take  
As protectors others besides  
Him,—  
God doth watch over them;  
And thou art not  
The disposer of their affairs.

7\. Thus have We sent  
By inspiration to thee  
An Arabic Qur-ān:  
That thou mayest warn  
The Mother of Cities  
And all around her,—  
And warn (them) of  
The Day of Assembly,  
Of which there is no doubt:  
(When) some will be  
In the Garden, and some  
In the Blazing Fire.

8\. If God had so willed,  
He could have made them  
A single people; but He  
Admits whom He will  
To His Mercy;  
And the wrong-doers  
Will have no protector  
Nor helper.

9\. What! Have they taken  
(For worship) protectors

<span id="page_1307">p. 1307</span>

Besides Him? But it is  
God,—He is the Protector,  
And it is He Who  
Gives life to the dead:  
It is He Who has power  
Over all things.

##### SECTION 2.

10\. Whatever it be wherein  
Ye differ, the decision  
Thereof is with God:  
Such is God my Lord:  
In Him I trust,  
And to Him I turn.

11\. (He is) the Creator  
Of the heavens and  
The earth: He has made  
For you pairs  
From among yourselves,  
And pairs among cattle:  
By this means does He  
Multiply you: there is nothing  
Whatever like unto Him,  
And He is the One  
That hears and sees (all things).

12\. To Him belong the keys  
Of the heavens and the earth:

<span id="page_1308">p. 1308</span>

He enlarges and restricts.  
The Sustenance to whom  
He will: for He knows  
Full well all things.

13\. The same religion has He  
Established for you as that  
Which He enjoined on Noah—  
The which We have sent  
By inspiration to thee—  
And that which We enjoined  
On Abraham, Moses, and Jesus:  
Namely, that ye should remain  
Steadfast in Religion, and make  
No divisions therein:  
To those who worship  
Other things than God,  
Hard is the (way)  
To which thou callest them,  
God chooses to Himself  
Those whom He pleases,  
And guides to Himself  
Those who turn (to Him).

14\. And they became divided  
Only after knowledge  
Reached them,—through selfish  
Envy as between themselves.  
Had it not been  
For a Word that

<span id="page_1309">p. 1309</span>

Went forth before  
From thy Lord,  
(Tending) to a Term appointed,  
The matter would have  
Been settled between them:  
But truly those who have  
Inherited the Book after them  
Are in suspicious (disquieting)  
Doubt concerning it.

15\. Now then, for that (reason),  
Call (them to the Faith),  
And stand steadfast  
As thou art commanded,  
Nor follow thou their vain  
Desires; but say: "I believe  
In the Book which  
God has sent down;  
And I am commanded  
To judge justly between you.  
God is our Lord  
And your Lord. For us  
(Is the responsibility for)  
Our deeds, and for you  
For your deeds. There is  
No contention between us  
And you. God will  
Bring us together,  
And to Him is  
(Our) final goal.

<span id="page_1310">p. 1310</span>

16\. But those who dispute  
Concerning God after He  
Has been accepted,—  
Futile is their dispute  
In the sight of  
Their Lord: on them  
Is Wrath, and for them  
Will be a Penalty  
Terrible.

17\. It is God Who has  
Sent down the Book in truth,  
And the Balance  
(By which to weigh conduct).  
And what will make thee  
Realise that perhaps the Hour  
Is close at hand?

18\. Only those wish to  
Hasten it who believe not  
In it: those who believe  
Hold it in awe,  
And know that it is  
The Truth. Behold, verily  
Those that dispute concerning  
The Hour are far astray.

19\. Gracious is God  
To His servants:

<span id="page_1311">p. 1311</span>

He gives Sustenance  
To whom He pleases:  
And He has Power  
And can carry out  
His Will.

##### SECTION 3.

20\. To any that desires  
The tilth of the Hereafter,  
We give increase  
In his tilth; and to any  
That desires the tilth  
Of this world, We grant  
Somewhat thereof, but he  
Has no share or lot  
In the Hereafter.

21\. What! Have they partners  
(In godhead), who have  
Established for them some  
Religion without the permission  
Of God? Had it not  
Been for the Decree  
Of Judgment, the matter  
Would have been decided  
Between them (at once).  
But verily the wrong-doers  
Will have a grievous Penalty.

22\. Thou wilt see the wrong-doers  
In fear on account of what

<span id="page_1312">p. 1312</span>

They have earned, and (the burden  
Of) that must (necessarily)  
Fall on them. But those  
Who believe and work  
Righteous deeds will be  
In the luxuriant meads  
Of the Gardens: they shall  
Have, before their Lord,  
All that they wish for.  
That will indeed be  
The magnificent Bounty  
(Of God).

23\. That is (the Bounty) whereof  
God gives Glad Tidings  
To His Servants who  
Believe and do righteous deeds.  
Say: "No reward do I  
Ask of you for this  
Except the love  
Of those near of kin."  
And if any one earns  
Any good, We shall give  
Him an increase of good  
In respect thereof: for God  
Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Ready  
To appreciate (service).

24\. What! Do they say,  
"He has forged a falsehood  
Against God"? But if God  
Willed, He could seal up

<span id="page_1313">p. 1313</span>

Thy heart. And God  
Blots out Vanity, and proves  
The Truth by His Words.  
For He knows well  
The secrets of all hearts.

25\. He is the One that accepts  
Repentance from His Servants  
And forgives sins:  
And He knows all  
That ye do.

26\. And He listens to  
Those who believe and  
Do deeds of righteousness,  
And gives them increase  
Of His Bounty: but  
For the Unbelievers there is  
A terrible Penalty.

27\. If God were to enlarge  
The provision for His Servants,  
They would indeed transgress  
Beyond all bounds  
Through the earth;  
But He sends (it) down  
In due measure  
As He pleases.  
For He is with His Servants  
Well-acquainted, Watchful.

28\. He is the One that sends down  
Rain (even) after (men) have

<span id="page_1314">p. 1314</span>

Given up all hope,  
And scatters His Mercy  
(Far and wide). And He  
Is the Protector, Worthy  
Of all Praise.

29\. And among His Signs  
Is the creation of  
The heavens and the earth,  
And the living creatures  
That He has scattered  
Through them: and He  
Has power to gather them  
Together when He wills.

##### SECTION 4.

30\. Whatever misfortune  
Happens to you, is because

<span id="page_1315">p. 1315</span>

Of the things your hands  
Have wrought, and for many  
(Of them) He grants forgiveness.

31\. Nor can ye frustrate (aught),  
(Fleeing) through the earth;  
Nor have ye, besides God,  
Any one to protect  
Or to help.

32\. And among His Signs  
Are the ships, smooth-running  
Through the ocean, (tall)  
As mountains.

33\. If it be His Will,  
He can still the Wind:  
Then would they become  
Motionless on the back  
Of the (ocean). Verily  
In this are Signs  
For everyone who patiently  
Perseveres and is grateful.

34\. Or He can cause them  
To perish because of  
The (evil) which (the men)  
Have earned; but much  
Doth He forgive.

<span id="page_1316">p. 1316</span>

35\. But let those know, who  
Dispute about Our Signs,  
That there is for them  
No way of escape.

36\. Whatever ye are given (here)  
Is (but) a convenience  
Of this Life: but that  
Which is with God  
Is better and more lasting:  
(It is) for those who believe  
And put their trust  
In their Lord;

37\. Those who avoid the greater  
Crimes and shameful deeds,  
And, when they are angry  
Even then forgive;

38\. Those who hearken  
To their Lord, and establish

<span id="page_1317">p. 1317</span>

Regular prayer; who (conduct)  
Their affairs by mutual  
Consultation;  
Who spend out of what  
We bestow on them  
For Sustenance;

39\. And those who, when  
An oppressive wrong is inflicted  
On them, (are not cowed  
But) help and defend themselves.

40\. The recompense for an injury  
Is an injury equal thereto  
(In degree): but if a person  
Forgives and makes reconciliation,

<span id="page_1318">p. 1318</span>

His reward is due  
From God: for (God)  
Loveth not those who  
Do wrong.

41\. But indeed if any do help  
And defend themselves  
After a wrong (done)  
To them, against such  
There is no cause  
Of blame.

42\. The blame is only  
Against those who oppress  
Men with wrong-doing  
And insolently transgress  
Beyond bounds through the land,  
Defying right and justice:  
For such there will be  
A Penalty grievous.

43\. But indeed if any  
Show patience and forgive,  
That would truly be  
An exercise of courageous will  
And resolution in the conduct  
Of affairs.

<span id="page_1319">p. 1319</span>

##### SECTION 5.

44\. For any whom God  
Leaves astray, there is  
No protector thereafter.  
And thou wilt see  
The wrong-doers, when  
In sight of the Penalty,  
Say: "Is there any way  
(To effect) a return?"

45\. And thou wilt see them  
Brought forward to the (Penalty),  
In a humble frame of mind  
Because of (their) disgrace,  
(And) looking with a stealthy  
Glance. And the Believers  
Will say: "Those are indeed.  
In loss. who have given  
To perdition their own selves  
And those belonging to them  
On the Day of Judgment.  
Behold! Truly the wrong-doers  
Are in a lasting Penalty!"

46\. And no protectors have they  
To help them,  
Other than God.  
And for any whom God  
Leaves to stray, there is  
No way (to the Goal).

<span id="page_1320">p. 1320</span>

47\. Hearken ye to your Lord,  
Before there come a Day  
Which there will be  
No putting back, because  
Of (the ordainment of) God!  
That Day there will be  
For you no place of refuge  
Nor will there be for you  
Any room for denial  
(Of your sins)!

48\. If then they turn away,  
We have not sent thee  
As a guard over them.  
Thy duty is but to convey  
(The Message). And truly,  
When We give man  
A taste of a Mercy  
From ourselves, he doth  
Exult thereat, but  
When some ill happens  
To him, on account  
Of the deeds which  
His hands have sent forth,  
Truly then is man ungrateful!

49\. To God belongs the dominion  
Of the heavens and the earth.  
He creates what He wills  
(And plans). He bestows

<span id="page_1321">p. 1321</span>

(Children) male or female  
According to His Will (and Plan),

50\. Or He bestows both males  
And females, and He leaves  
Barren whom He will:  
For He is full  
Of knowledge and power.

51\. It is not fitting  
For a man that God  
Should speak to him  
Except by inspiration,  
Or from behind a veil,  
Or by the sending  
Of a Messenger  
To reveal, with God's permission,  
What God wills: for He  
Is Most High, Most Wise.

52\. And thus have We,  
By Our command, sent

<span id="page_1322">p. 1322</span>

Inspiration to thee:  
Thou knewest not (before)  
What was Revelation, and  
What was Faith; but We  
Have made the (Qur-ān)  
A Light, wherewith We  
Guide such of Our servants  
As We will; and verily  
Thou dost guide (men)  
To the Straight Way,—

53\. The Way of God,  
To Whom belongs  
Whatever is in the heavens  
And whatever is on earth.  
Behold (how) all affairs  
Tend towards God!
