### Sūra II.

### Baqara, or the Heifer.

*In the name of God, most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. A. L. M.

2\. This is the Book;  
In it is guidance sure, without doubt,  
To those who fear God;

3\. Who believe in the Unseen,  
Are steadfast in prayer,  
And spend out of what We  
Have provided for them;

4\. And who believe in the Revelation  
Sent to thee,

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

And sent before thy time,  
And (in their hearts)  
Have the assurance of the Hereafter.

5\. They are on (true) guidance,  
From their Lord, and it is  
These who will prosper.

6\. As to those who reject Faith,  
It is the same to them  
Whether thou warn them  
Or do not warn them;  
They will not believe.

7\. God hath set a seal  
On their hearts and on their hearing,  
And on their eyes is a veil;  
Great is the penalty they (incur).

##### SECTION 2.

8\. Of the people there are some who say:  
"We believe in God and the Last Day;"  
But they do not (really) believe.

9\. Fain would they deceive  
God and those who believe,  
But they only deceive themselves,  
And realize (it) not!

10\. In their hearts is a disease;

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

And God has increased their disease:  
And grievous is the penalty they (incur),  
Because they are false (to themselves).

11\. When it is said to them:  
"Make not mischief on the earth,"  
They say: "Why, we only  
Want to make peace!"

12\. Of a surety, they are the ones  
Who make mischief,  
But they realize (it) not.

13\. When it is said to them:  
"Believe as the others believe:"  
They say: "Shall we believe  
As the fools believe?"  
Nay, of a surety they are the fools,  
But they do not know."

14\. When they meet those who believe,  
They say: "We believe;"  
But when they are alone  
With their evil ones,  
They say: "We are really with you:  
We (were) only jesting."

15\. God will throw back  
Their mockery on them,  
And give them rope in their trespasses;  
So they will wander like blind ones  
(To and fro).

16\. These are they who have bartered  
Guidance for error:

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

But their traffic is profitless,  
And they have lost true direction,

17\. Their similitude is that of a man  
Who kindled a fire;  
When it lighted all around him,  
God took away their light  
And left them in utter darkness.  
So they could not see.

18\. Deaf, dumb, and blind,  
They will not return (to the path).

19\. Or (another similitude)  
Is that of a rain-laden cloud  
From the sky: in it are zones  
Of darkness, and thunder and lightning:  
They press their fingers in their ears  
To keep out the stunning thunder-clap,  
The while they are in terror of death.  
But God is ever round  
The rejecters of Faith!

20\. The lightning all but snatches away  
Their sight; every time the light  
(Helps) them, they walk therein,  
And when the darkness grows on them,  
They stand still.  
And if God willed, He could take away  
Their faculty of hearing and seeing;  
For God hath power over all things

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

##### SECTION 3.

21\. O ye people!  
Adore your Guardian-Lord,  
Who created you  
And those who came before you,  
That ye may have the chance  
To learn righteousness;

22\. Who has made the earth your couch,  
And the heavens your canopy;  
And sent down rain from the heavens;  
And brought forth therewith  
Fruits for your sustenance;  
Then set not up rivals unto God  
When ye know (the truth).

23\. And if ye are in doubt  
As to what We have revealed  
From time to time to Our servant,  
Then produce a Sūra  
Like thereunto;  
And call your witnesses or helpers  
(If there are any) besides God,  
If your (doubts) are true.

24\. But if ye cannot  
And of a surety ye cannot—  
Then fear the Fire  
Whose fuel is Men and Stones,—  
Which is prepared for those

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

Who reject Faith.

25\. But give glad tidings  
To those who believe  
And work righteousness,  
That their portion is Gardens,  
Beneath which rivers flow.  
Every time they are fed  
With fruits therefrom,  
They say: "Why, this is  
What we were fed with before,"  
For they are given things in similitude;  
And they have therein  
Companions pure (and holy);  
And they abide therein (for ever).

26\. God disdains not to use  
The similitude of things,  
Lowest as well as highest.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Those who believe know  
That it is truth from their Lord;  
But those who reject Faith say:  
"What means God by this similitude?"  
By it He causes many to stray,  
And many He leads into the right path;  
But He causes not to stray,  
Except those who forsake (the path),—

27\. Those who break God's Covenant  
After it is ratified,  
And who sunder what God  
Has ordered to be joined,  
And do mischief on earth:  
These cause loss (only) to themselves.

28\. How can ye reject  
The faith in God?—  
Seeing that ye were without life,  
And He gave you life  
Then will He cause you to die,  
And will again bring you to life;  
And again to Him will ye return.

29\. It is He Who hath created for you  
All things that are on earth;  
Moreover His design comprehended the heavens,  
For He gave order and perfection  
To the seven firmaments;  
And of all things  
He hath perfect knowledge.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

##### SECTION 4.

30\. Behold, thy Lord said to the angels: "I will create  
A vicegerent on earth." They said:  
"Wilt Thou place therein one who will make  
Mischief therein and shed blood?—  
Whilst we do celebrate Thy praises  
And glorify Thy holy (name)?"  
He said: "I know what ye know not."

31\. And He taught Adam the nature  
Of all things; then He placed them  
Before the angels, and said: "Tell Me  
The nature of these if ye are right."

32\. They said: "Glory to Thee: of knowledge

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

We have none, save what Thou  
Hast taught us: in truth it is Thou  
Who art perfect in knowledge and wisdom."

33\. He said: "O Adam! tell them  
Their natures." When he had told them,  
God said: "Did I not tell you  
That I know the secrets of heaven  
And earth, and I know what ye reveal  
And what ye conceal?"

34\. And behold, We said to the angels:  
"Bow down to Adam: "and they bowed down:  
Not so Iblīs: he refused and was haughty:  
He was of those who reject Faith.

35\. We said: "O Adam! dwell thou  
And thy wife in the Garden;  
And eat of the bountiful things therein  
As (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree,  
Or ye run into harm and transgression."

36\. Then did Satan make them slip  
From the (Garden), and get them out

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Of the state (of felicity) in which  
They had been. We said:  
"Get ye down, all (ye people),  
With enmity between yourselves.  
On earth will be your dwelling-place  
And your means of livelihood—  
For a time."

37\. Then learnt Adam from his Lord  
Words of inspiration, and his Lord  
Turned towards him; for He  
Is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.

38\. We said: "Get ye down all from here;  
And if, as is sure, there comes to you  
Guidance from Me, whosoever  
Follows My guidance, on them  
Shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.

39\. "But those who reject Faith  
And belie Our Signs,  
They shall be Companions of the Fire;  
They shall abide therein."

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

##### SECTION 5.

40\. O Children of Israel! call to mind  
The (special) favour which I bestowed  
Upon you, and fulfil your Covenants  
With Me as I fulfil My Covenant  
With you, and fear none but Me.

41\. And believe in what I reveal,  
Confirming the revelation  
Which is with you,  
And be not the first to reject  
Faith therein, nor sell My Signs  
For a small price; and fear Me,  
And Me alone.

42\. And cover not Truth  
With falsehood, nor conceal  
The Truth when ye know (what it is).

43\. And be steadfast in prayer;  
Practise regular charity;  
And bow down your heads  
With those who bow down (in worship).

44\. Do ye enjoin right conduct  
On the people, and forget  
(To practise it) yourselves,  
And yet ye study the Scripture?  
Will ye not understand?

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

45\. Nay, seek (God's) help  
With patient perseverance  
And prayer:  
It is indeed hard, except  
To those who bring a lowly spirit,—

46\. Who bear in mind the certainty  
That they are to meet their Lord,  
And that they are to return to Him.

##### SECTION 6.

47\. O Children of Israel! call to mind  
The (special) favour which I bestowed  
Upon you, and that I preferred you  
To all others (for My Message).

48\. Then guard yourselves against a day  
When one soul shall not avail another  
Nor shall intercession be accepted for her,  
Nor shall compensation be taken from her,  
Nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).

49\. And remember, We delivered you  
From the people of Pharaoh: they set you  
Hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

Your sons and let your women-folk live;  
Therein was a tremendous trial from your Lord.

50\. And remember We divided  
The Sea for you and saved you  
And drowned Pharaoh's people  
Within your very sight.

51\. And remember We appointed  
Forty nights for Moses,  
And in his absence ye took  
The calf (for worship),  
And ye did grievous wrong.

52\. Even then We did forgive you;  
There was a chance for you  
To be grateful.

53\. And remember We gave  
Moses the Scripture and the Criterion

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

(Between right and wrong): there was  
A chance for you to be guided aright.

54\. And remember Moses said  
To his people: "O my people!  
Ye have indeed wronged  
Yourselves by your worship of the calf:  
So turn (in repentance) to your Maker,  
And slay yourselves (the wrong-doers);  
That will be better for you  
In the sight of your Maker."  
Then He turned towards you (in forgiveness):  
For He is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.

55\. And remember ye said: "O Moses!  
We shall never believe in thee  
Until we see God manifestly,"  
But ye were dazed  
With thunder and lightning  
Even as ye looked on.

56\. Then We raised you up  
After your death:  
Ye had the chance  
To be grateful.

57\. And We gave you the shade of clouds

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

And sent down to you  
Manna and quails, saying:  
"Eat of the good things  
We have provided fcr you:"  
(But they rebelled);  
To Us they did no harm,  
But they harmed their own souls.

58\. And remember We said:  
"Enter this town, and eat  
Of the plenty therein  
As ye wish; but enter  
The gate with humility,  
In posture and in words,  
And We shall forgive you your faults  
And increase (the portion of)  
Those who do good."

59\. But the transgressors  
Changed the word from that  
Which had been given them;  
So We sent on the transgt essors  
A plague from heaven,  
For that they infringed  
(Our command) repeatedly.

##### SECTION 7.

60\. And remember Moses prayed  
For water for his people;  
We said: "Strike the rock  
With thy staff." Then gushed forth

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

Therefrom twelve springs.  
Each group knew its own place  
For water. So eat and drink  
Of the sustenance provided by God,  
And do no evil nor mischief  
On the (face of the) earth.

61\. And remember ye said:  
"O Moses! we cannot endure  
One kind of food (always);  
So beseech thy Lord for us  
To produce for us of what the earth  
Groweth,—its pot-herbs, and cucumbers,  
Its garlic, lentils, and onions."  
He said: "Will ye exchange  
The better for the worse?  
Go ye down to any town,"  
And ye shall find what ye want!"

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

They were covered with humiliation  
And misery; they drew  
On themselves the wrath of God.  
This because they went on  
Rejecting the Signs of God  
And slaying His Messengers  
Without just cause.  
This because they rebelled  
And went on transgressing.

##### SECTION 8.

62\. Those who believe (in the Qur-ān),  
And those who follow the Jewish (scriptures),  
And the Christians and the Sabians,—  
Any who believe in God  
And the Last Day,  
And work righteousness,  
Shall have their reward

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

With their Lord: on them  
Shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.

63\. And remember We took  
Your Covenant  
And We raised above you  
(The towering height)  
Of Mount (Sinai):  
(Saying): "Hold firmly  
To what We have given you  
And bring (ever) to remembrance  
What is therein:  
Perchance ye may fear God."

64\. But ye turned back thereafter:  
Had it not been for the Grace  
And Mercy of God to you,  
Ye had surely been  
Among the lost.

65\. And well ye knew  
Those amongst you  
Who transgressed  
In the matter of the Sabbath:  
We said to them:  
"Be ye apes,  
Despised and rejected."

66\. So We made it an example  
To their own time

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

And to their posterity,  
And a lesson  
To those who fear God.

67\. And remember Moses said  
To his people: "God commands  
That ye sacrifice a heifer."  
They said: "Makest thou  
A laughing-stock of us?"  
He said: "God save me  
From being an ignorant (fool)!"

68\. They said: "Beseech on our behalf  
Thy Lord to make plain to us  
What (heifer) it is!"  
He said: "He says: the heifer  
Should be neither too old  
Nor too young, but of middling  
Age: now do what ye are commanded!"

69\. They said: "Beseech on our behalf  
Thy Lord to make plain to us  
Her colour." He said: "He says:  
A fawn-coloured heifer,  
Pure and rich in tone,  
The admiration of beholders!"

70\. They said: "Beseech on our behalf  
Thy Lord to make plain to us  
What she is: to us are all heifers  
Alike: we wish indeed for guidance,  
If God wills."

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

71\. He said: "He says: a heifer  
Not trained to till the soil  
Or water the fields: sound  
And without blemish." They said:  
"Now hast thou brought  
The truth." Then they offered  
Her in sacrifice,  
But not with good-will.

##### SECTION 9.

72\. Remember ye slew a man  
And fell into a dispute  
Among yourselves as to the crime:  
But God was to bring forth  
What ye did hide.

73\. So We said: "Strike the (body)  
With a piece of the (heifer)."  
Thus God bringeth the dead  
To life and showeth you His Signs:  
Perchance ye may understand.

74\. Thenceforth were your hearts  
Hardened: they became  
Like a rock and even worse  
In hardness. For among rocks  
There are some from which  
Rivers gush forth; others  
There are which when split  
Asunder send forth water;  
And others which sink

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

For fear of God. And God is  
Not unmindful of what ye do.

75\. Can ye (O ye men of Faith)  
Entertain the hope that they  
Will believe in you?—  
Seeing that a party of them  
Heard the Word of God,  
And perverted it knowingly  
After they understood it.

76\. Behold! when they meet  
The men of Faith, they say:  
"We believe": but when  
They meet each other in private,  
They say: "Shall you tell them  
What God hath revealed to you,  
That they may engage you  
In argument about it  
Before your Lord?"—  
Do ye not understand (their aim)?

77\. Know they not that God  
Knoweth what they conceal  
And what they reveal?

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

78\. And there are among them  
Illiterates, who know not the Book,  
But (see therein their own) desires,  
And they do nothing but conjecture.

79\. Then woe to those who write  
The Book with their own hands,  
And then say: "This is from God,"  
To traffic with it  
For a miserable price!—  
Woe to them for what their hands  
Do write, and for the gain  
They make thereby.

80\. And they say: "The Fire  
Shall not touch us  
But for a few numbered days:"  
Say: "Have ye taken a promise  
From God, for He never  
Breaks His promise?  
Or is it that ye say of God  
What ye do not know?"

81\. Nay, those who seek gain  
In Evil, and are girt round  
By their sins,  
They are Companions of the Fire:  
Therein shall they abide  
(For ever).

82\. But those who have faith  
And work righteousness,

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

They are Companions of the Garden:  
Therein shall they abide  
(For ever).

##### SECTION 10.

83\. And remember We took  
A Covenant from the Children  
Of Israel (to this effect):  
Worship none but God;  
Treat with kindness  
Your parents and kindred,  
And orphans and those in need;  
Speak fair to the people;  
Be steadfast in prayer;  
And practise regular charity.  
Then did ye turn back,  
Except a few among you,  
And ye backslide (even now).

84\. And remember We took  
Your Covenant (to this effect):  
Shed no blood amongst you,  
Nor turn out your own people  
From your homes: and this  
Ye solemnly ratified,  
And to this ye can bear witness.

85\. After this it is ye, the same people,  
Who slay among yourselves,  
And banish a party of you  
From their homes; assist  
(Their enemies) against them,  
In guilt and rancour;  
And if they come to you  
As captives, ye ransom them,

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

Though it was not lawful  
For you to banish them.  
Then is it only a part of the Book  
That ye believe in,  
And do ye reject the rest?  
But what is the reward for those  
Among you who behave like this  
But disgrace in this life?—  
And on the Day of Judgment  
They shall be consigned  
To the most grievous penalty.  
For God is not unmindful  
Of what ye do.

86\. These are the people who buy  
The life of this world at the price  
Of the Hereafter: their penalty  
Shall not be lightened  
Nor shall they be helped.

##### SECTION 11.

87\. We gave Moses the Book  
And followed him up  
With a succession of Apostles;  
We gave Jesus the son of Mary  
Clear (Signs) and strengthened him  
With the holy spirit. Is it  
That whenever there comes to you  
An Apostle with what ye  
Yourselves desire not, ye are  
Puffed up with pride?—  
Some ye called impostors,  
And others ye slay!

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

88\. They say, "Our hearts  
Are the wrappings (which preserve  
God's Word: we need no more)."  
Nay, God's curse is on them  
For their blasphemy:  
Little is it they believe.

89\. And when there comes to them  
A Book from God, confirming  
What is with them,—although  
From of old they had prayed  
For victory against those  
Without Faith,—when there comes.  
To them that which they  
(Should) have recognized,  
They refuse to believe in it  
But the curse of God  
Is on those without Faith.

90\. Miserable is the price  
For which they have sold  
Their souls, in that they  
Deny (the revelation)  
Which God has sent down,  
In insolent envy that God  
Of His Grace should send it  
To any of His servants He pleases:

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

Thus have they drawn  
On themselves Wrath upon Wrath.  
And humiliating is the punishment  
Of those who reject Faith.

91\. When it is said to them,  
"Believe in what God  
Hath sent down," they say,  
"We believe in what was sent down  
To us": yet they reject  
All besides, even if it be Truth  
Confirming what is with them.  
Say: "Why then have ye slain  
The prophets of God in times  
Gone by, if ye did indeed  
Believe?"

92\. There came to you Moses  
With clear (Signs); yet  
Ye worshipped the Calf  
(Even) after that, and ye  
Did behave wrongfully.

93\. And remember We took  
Your Covenant and We raised  
Above you (the towering height)  
Of Mount (Sinai):  
(Saying): "Hold firmly  
To what We have given you,  
And hearken (to the Law)"  
They said: "We hear,  
And we disobey"  
And they had to drink

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

Into their hearts  
(Of the taint) of the Calf  
Because of their Faithlessness.  
Say: "Vile indeed  
Are the behests of your Faith  
If ye have any faith!"

94\. Say: "If the last Home,  
With God, be for you specially,  
And not for anyone else,  
Then seek ye for death,  
If ye are sincere."

95\. But they will never seek  
For death, on account of the (sins)  
Which their hands have sent  
On before them.  
And God is well-acquainted  
With the wrong-doers.

96\. Thou wilt indeed find them,  
Of all people, most greedy  
Of life,—even more  
Than the idolaters:  
Each one of them wishes  
He could be given a life  
Of a thousand years:  
But the grant of such life  
Will not save him  
From (due) punishment.  
For God sees well  
All that they do.

##### SECTION 12.

97\. Say: Whoever is an enemy  
To Gabriel—for he brings down

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

The (revelation) to thy heart  
By God's will, a confirmation  
Of what went before,  
And guidance and glad tidings  
For those who believe,—

98\. Whoever is an enemy to God  
And His angels and apostles,  
To Gabriel and Michael,—  
Lo! God is an enemy to those  
Who reject Faith.

99\. We have sent down to thee  
Manifest Signs (*āyāt*);  
And none reject them  
But those who are perverse.

100\. Is it not (the case) that  
Every time they make a Covenant,  
Some party among them  
Throw it aside?—Nay,  
Most of them are faithless.

101\. And when there came to them  
An Apostle from God,  
Confirming what was with them,  
A party of the People of the Book  
Threw away the Book of God  
Behind their backs,  
As if (it had been something)  
They did not know!

102\. They followed what the evil ones  
Gave out (falsely)  
Against the power  
Of Solomon: the blasphemers  
Were, not Solomon, but  
The evil ones, teaching men

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

Magic, and such things  
As came down at Babylon  
To the angels Hārūt and Mārūt.  
But neither of these taught anyone  
(Such things) without saying:  
"We are only for trial;  
So do not blaspheme."  
They learned from them  
The means to sow discord  
Between man and wife.  
But they could not thus  
Harm anyone except  
By God's permission.  
And they learned what harmed them,  
Not what profited them.  
And they knew that the buyers  
Of (magic) would have  
No share in the happiness  
Of the Hereafter. And vile  
Was the price for which  
They did sell their souls,  
If they but knew!

103\. If they had kept their Faith  
And guarded themselves from evil,

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

Far better had been  
The reward from their Lord,  
If they but knew!

##### SECTION 13

104\. ye of Faith!  
Say not (to the Apostle)  
Words of ambiguous import,  
But words of respect;  
And hearken (to him):  
To those without Faith  
Is a grievous punishment.

105\. It is never the wish  
Of those without Faith  
Among the People of the Book,  
Nor of the Pagans,  
That anything good  
Should come down to you  
From your Lord.  
But God will choose  
For His special Mercy  
Whom He will—for God is  
Lord of grace abounding.

106\. None of Our revelations  
Do We abrogate  
Or cause to be forgotten,  
But We substitute

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Something better or similar:  
Knowest thou not that God  
Hath power over all things?

107\. Knowest thou not  
That to God belongeth  
The dominion of the heavens  
And the earth?  
And besides Him ye have  
Neither patron nor helper.

108\. Would ye question  
Your Apostle as Moses's  
Was questioned of old?  
But whoever changeth  
From Faith to Unbelief,  
Hath strayed without doubt  
From the even way.

109\. Quite a number of the People  
Of the Book wish they could  
Turn you (people) back  
To infidelity after ye have believed,  
From selfish envy,  
After the Truth hath become  
Manifest unto them:  
But forgive and overlook,

Till God accomplish  
His purpose; for God  
Hath power over all things.'

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

110\. And be steadfast in prayer  
And regular in charity:  
And whatever good  
Ye send forth for your souls  
Before you, ye shall find it  
With God: for God sees  
Well all that ye do.

111\. And they say: "None  
Shall enter Paradise unless  
He be a Jew or a Christian."  
Those are their (vain) desires.  
Say: "Produce your proof  
If ye are truthful."

112\. Nay,—whoever submits  
His whole self to God  
And is a doer of good,  
He will get his reward  
With his Lord;  
On such shall be no fear,  
Nor shall they grieve.

##### SECTION 14.

113\. The Jews say: "The Christians  
Have naught (to stand) upon;  
And the Christians say:  
"The Jews have naught  
(To stand) upon." Yet they  
(Profess to) study the (same) Book.  
Like unto their word  
Is what those say who know not;

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

But God will judge  
Between them in their quarrel  
On the Day of Judgment.

114\. And who is more unjust  
Than he who forbids  
That in places for the worship  
Of God, God's name should be  
Celebrated?—whose zeal  
Is (in fact) to ruin them?  
It was not fitting that such  
Should themselves enter them  
Except in fear. For them  
There is nothing but disgrace  
In this world, and in the world  
To come, an exceeding torment.

115\. To God belong the East  
And the West: whithersoever  
Ye turn, there is the Presence  
Of God. For God is All-Pervading,  
All-Knowing.

116\. They say: "God hath begotten  
A son": Glory be to Him.—Nay,  
To Him belongs all  
That is in the heavens  
And on earth: everything  
Renders worship to Him.'"

117\. To Him is due  
The primal origin

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

Of the heavens and the earth:  
When He decreeth a matter,  
He saith to it: "Be,"  
And it is.

118\. Say those without knowledge:  
"Why speaketh not God  
Unto us? Or why cometh not  
Unto us a Sign?"  
So said the people before them  
Words of similar import.  
Their hearts are alike.  
We have indeed made clear  
The Signs unto any people  
Who hold firmly  
To Faith (in their hearts).

119\. Verily We have sent thee  
In truth as a bearer  
Of glad tidings and a warner:  
But of thee no question  
Shall be asked of the Companions  
Of the Blazing Fire.

120\. Never will the Jews  
Or the Christians be satisfied  
With thee unless thou follow  
Their form of religion. Say:

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

"The Guidance of God,—that  
Is the (only) Guidance."  
Wert thou to follow their desires  
After the knowledge  
Which hath reached thee,  
Then wouldst thou find  
Neither Protector nor Helper  
Against God.

121\. Those to whom We have sent  
The Book study it as it  
Should be studied: they are  
The ones that believe therein:  
Those who reject faith therein,—  
The loss is their own.

##### SECTION 15.

122\. O Children of Israel! call to mind  
The special favour which I bestowed  
Upon you, and that I preferred you  
To all others (for My Message).

123\. Then guard yourselves against a Day

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

When one soul shall not avail another,  
Nor shall compensation be  
accepted from her  
Nor shall intercession profit her  
Nor shall anyone be helped (from outside).

124\. And remember that Abraham  
Was tried by his Lord  
With certain Commands,  
Which he fulfilled:  
He said: "I will make thee  
An Imām to the Nations."  
He pleaded: "And also  
(Imāms) from my offspring!"  
He answered: "But My Promise  
Is not within the reach  
Of evil-doers."

125\. Remember We made the House  
A place of assembly for men  
And a place of safety;  
And take ye the Station  
Of Abraham as a place  
Of prayer; and We covenanted  
With Abraham and lsmā’īl,  
That they should sanctify  
My House for those who  
Compass it round, or use it

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

As a retreat, or bow, or  
Prostrate themselves (therein  
In prayer).

126\. And remember Abraham said:  
"My Lord, make this a City  
Of Peace, and feed its People  
With fruits,—such of them  
As believe in God and the Last Day."  
He said: "(Yea), and such as  
Reject Faith,—for a while  
Will I grant them their pleasure,  
But will soon drive them  
To the torment of Fire,—  
An evil destination (indeed)!"

127\. And remember Abraham  
And Ismā’īl raised  
The foundations of the House  
(With this prayer): "Our Lord!  
Accept (this service) from us:  
For Thou art the All-Hearing,  
The All-Knowing.

128\. "Our Lord! make of us  
Muslims, bowing to Thy (Will),  
And of our progeny a people  
Muslim, bowing to Thy (Will);  
And show us our places for  
The celebration of (due) rites;  
And turn unto us (in Mercy);  
For Thou art the Oft-Returning,  
Most Merciful.

129\. "Our Lord! send amongst them  
An Apostle of their own,  
Who shall rehearse Thy Signs  
To them and instruct them

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

In Scripture and Wisdom,  
And sanctify them:  
For Thou art the Exalted in Might,  
The Wise."

##### SECTION 16.

130\. And who turns away  
From the religion of Abraham  
But such as debase their souls  
With folly? Him We chose  
And rendered pure in this world:  
And he will be in the Hereafter  
In the ranks of the Righteous.

131\. Behold! his Lord said  
To him: "Bow (thy will to Me):"  
He said: "I bow (my will)  
To the Lord and Cherisher  
Of the Universe."

132\. And this was the legacy  
That Abraham left to his sons,  
And so did Jacob;  
"Oh my sons! God hath chosen  
The Faith for you; then die not  
Except in the Faith of Islam."

133\. Were ye witnesses  
When Death appeared before Jacob?  
Behold, he said to his sons:  
"What will ye worship after me?"  
They said: "We shall worship

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

Thy God and the God of thy fathers,—  
Of Abraham, Ismā'īl, and Isaac,—  
The One (True) God:  
To Him we bow (in Islam)."

134\. That was a People that hath  
Passed away. They shall reap  
The fruit of what they did,  
And ye of what ye do!  
Of their merits  
There is no question in your case!

135\. They say: "Become Jews  
Or Christians if ye would be guided  
(To salvation)." Say thou:  
"Nay! (I would rather) the Religion  
Of Abraham the True,  
And he joined not gods with God."

136\. Say ye: "We believe  
In God, and the revelation  
Given to us, and to Abraham,  
Ismā'īl, Isaac, Jacob,  
And the Tribes, and that given  
To Moses and Jesus, and that given  
To (all) Prophets from their Lord:  
We make no difference  
Between one and another of them:  
And we bow to God (in Islam)."

137\. So if they believe  
As ye believe, they are indeed  
On the right path; but if  
They turn back, it is they

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

Who are in schism; but God will  
Suffice thee as against them,  
And He is the All-Hearing,  
The All-Knowing.

138\. (Our religion is)  
The Baptism of God:  
And who can baptize better  
Than God? And it is He  
Whom we worship.

139\. Say: Will ye dispute  
With us about God, seeing  
That He is our Lord  
And your Lord; that we  
Are responsible for our doings  
And ye for yours; and that  
We are sincere (in our faith) In him?

140\. Or do ye say that  
Abraham, Ismā'īl, Isaac,  
Jacob and the Tribes were  
Jews or Christians?  
Say: Do ye know better  
Than God? Ah! who  
Is more unjust than those  
Who conceal the testimony  
They have from God?  
But God is not unmindful  
Of what ye do!

141\. That was a people that hath  
Passed away. They shall reap  
The fruit of what they did,  
And ye of what ye do!  
Of their merits  
There is no question in your case:

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

##### SECTION 17.

142\. The Fools among the people  
Will say: "What hath turned  
Them from the Qibla to which  
They were used?" Say:  
To God belong both East and West:  
He guideth whom He will  
To a Way that is straight.

143\. Thus have We made of you  
An *Ummat* justly balanced,  
That ye might be witnesses  
Over the nations,

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

And the Apostle a witness  
Over yourselves;  
And We appointed the Qibla  
To which thou wast used,  
Only to test those who followed  
The Apostle from those  
Who would turn on their heels  
(From the Faith). Indeed it was  
(A change) momentous, except  
To those guided by God.  
And never would God  
Make your faith of no effect.  
For God is to all people  
Most surely full of kindness,  
Most Merciful.

144\. We see the turning  
Of thy face (for guidance)  
To the heavens: now  
Shall We turn thee  
To a Qibla that shall  
Please thee. Turn then  
Thy face in the direction  
Of the sacred Mosque:  
Wherever ye are, turn  
Your faces in that direction.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

The people of the Book  
Know well that that is  
The truth from their Lord.  
Nor is God unmindful  
Of what they do.

145\. Even if thou wert to bring  
To the people of the Book  
All the Signs (together),  
They would not follow  
Thy Qibla; nor art thou  
Going to follow their Qibla;  
Nor indeed will they follow  
Each other's Qibla. If thou  
After the knowledge hath reached thee,  
Wert to follow their (vain)  
Desires,—then wert thou  
Indeed (clearly) in the wrong.

146\. The people of the Book  
Know this as they know  
Their own sons; but some  
Of them conceal the truth  
Which they themselves know.

147\. The Truth is from thy Lord;  
So be not at all in doubt.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

##### SECTION 18.

148\. To each is a goal  
To which God turns him;  
Then strive together (as in a race)  
Towards all that is good.  
Wheresoever ye are,  
God will bring you  
Together, For God  
Hath power over all things.

149\. From whencesoever  
Thou startest forth, turn  
Thy face in the direction  
Of the Sacred Mosque;  
That is indeed the truth  
From thy Lord. And God  
Is not unmindful  
Of what ye do.

150\. So from whencesoever  
Thou startest forth, turn  
Thy face in the direction  
Of the Sacred Mosque;  
And wheresoever ye are,  
Turn your face thither:  
That there be no ground  
Of dispute against you  
Among the people,  
Except those of them that are  
Bent on wickedness; so fear  
Them not, but fear Me;  
And that I may complete  
My favours on you, and ye  
May (consent to) be guided;

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

151\. A similar (favour  
Have ye already received)  
In that We have sent  
Among you an Apostle  
Of your own, rehearsing to you  
Our Signs, and sanctifying  
You, and instructing you  
In Scripture and Wisdom,  
And in new Knowledge.

152\. Then do ye remember  
Me; I will remember  
You. Be grateful to Me,  
And reject not Faith.

##### SECTION 19.

153\. O ye who believe! seek help  
With patient Perseverance  
And Prayer: for God is with those  
Who patiently persevere.

154\. And say not of those  
Who are slain in the way

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

Of God: "They are dead."  
Nay, they are living,  
Though ye perceive (it) not.

155\. Be sure we shall test you  
With something of fear  
And hunger, some loss  
In goods or lives or the fruits  
(Of your toil), but give  
Glad tidings to those  
Who patiently persevere,—

156\. Who say, when afflicted  
With calamity: "To God  
We belong, and to Him  
Is our return":—

157\. They are those on whom  
(Descend) blessings from God,  
And Mercy,  
And they are the ones  
That receive guidance.

158\. Behold! Ṣafa and Marwa  
Are among the Symbols  
Of God. So if those who visit  
The House in the Season  
Or at other times,  
Should compass them round,  
It is no sin in them.  
And if any one obeyeth his own

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

Impulse to Good,—  
Be sure that God  
Is He Who recogniseth  
And knoweth.

159\. Those who conceal  
The clear (Signs) We have  
Sent down, and the Guidance,  
After We have made it  
Clear for the People  
In the Book,—on them  
Shall be God's curse,  
And the curse of those  
Entitled to curse,—

160\. Except those who repent  
And make amends  
And openly declare (the Truth):  
To them I turn;  
For I am Oft-returning,  
Most Merciful.

161\. Those who reject Faith,  
And die rejecting,—  
On them is God's curse,  
And the curse of angels,  
And of all mankind;

162\. They will abide therein:  
Their penalty will not  
Be lightened, nor will  
Respite be their (lot).

163\. And your God  
Is One God:  
There is no god  
But He,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 20.

164\. Behold! In the creation  
Of the heavens and the earth;  
In the alternation  
Of the Night and the Day;  
In the sailing of the ships  
Through the Ocean  
For the profit of mankind;  
In the rain which God  
Sends down from the skies,  
And the life which He gives therewith  
To an earth that is dead;  
In the beasts of all kinds  
That He scatters  
Through the earth;  
In the change of the winds,  
And the clouds which they  
Trail like their slaves  
Between the sky and the earth;—  
(Here) indeed are Signs  
For a people that are wise.

165\. Yet there are men  
Who take (for worship)  
Others besides God,  
As equal (with God):

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

They love them  
As they should love God.  
But those of Faith are  
Overflowing in their love  
For God. If only  
The unrighteous could see,  
Behold, they would see  
The Penalty: that to God  
Belongs all power, and God  
Will strongly enforce  
The Penalty.

166 Then would those  
Who are followed  
Clear themselves of those  
Who follow (them):  
They would see the Penalty,  
And all relations  
Between them would be cut off.

167\. And those who followed  
Would say: "If only  
We had one more chance,  
We would clear ourselves  
Of them, as they have  
Cleared themselves of us."  
Thus will God show them  
(The fruits of) their deeds  
As (nothing but) regrets.  
Nor will there be a way  
For them out of the Fire.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

##### SECTION 21.

168\. O ye people!  
Eat of what is on earth,  
Lawful and good;  
And do not follow  
The footsteps of the Evil One,  
For he is to you  
An avowed enemy.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

169\. For he commands you  
What is evil  
And shameful,  
And that ye should say  
Of God that of which  
Ye have no knowledge.

170\. When it is said to them:  
"Follow what God hath revealed:"  
They say: "Nay! we shall follow  
The ways of our fathers."  
What! even though their fathers  
Were void of wisdom and guidance?

171\. The parable of those  
Who reject Faith is  
As if one were to shout  
Like a goat-herd, to things  
That listen to nothing  
But calls and cries:  
Deaf, dumb, and blind,  
They are void of wisdom.

172 O ye who believe!  
Eat of the good things  
That We have provided for you,  
And be grateful to God,  
If it is Him ye worship.

173\. He hath only forbidden you  
Dead meat, and blood,  
And the flesh of swine,  
And that on which

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

Any other name hath been invoked  
Besides that of God.  
But if one is forced by necessity,  
Without wilful disobedience,  
Nor transgressing due limits,—  
Then is he guiltless.  
For God is Oft-forgiving  
Most Merciful.

174\. Those who conceal  
God's revelations in the Book,  
And purchase for them  
A miserable profit,—  
They swallow into themselves  
Naught but Fire;  
God will not address them  
On the Day of Resurrection,  
Nor purify them:  
Grievous will be  
Their Penalty.

175\. They are the ones  
Who buy Error  
In place of Guidance  
And Torment in place  
Of Forgiveness.  
Ah! what boldness  
(They show) for the Fire!

176\. (Their doom is) because  
God sent down the Book  
In truth but those who seek  
Causes of dispute in the Book

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

Are in a schism  
Far (from the purpose).

##### SECTION 22.

177\. It is not righteousness  
That ye turn your faces  
Towards East or West;  
But it is righteousness—  
To believe in God  
And the Last Day,  
And the Angels,  
And the Book,  
And the Messengers;  
To spend of your substance,  
Out of love for Him,  
For your kin,  
For orphans,  
For the needy,  
For the wayfarer,  
For those who ask,  
And for the ransom of slaves;  
To be steadfast in prayer,  
And practice regular charity;  
To fulfil the contracts  
Which ye have made;

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

And to be firm and patient,  
In pain (or suffering)  
And adversity,  
And throughout  
All periods of panic.  
Such are the people  
Of truth, the God-fearing.

178\. O ye who believe!  
The law of equality  
Is prescribed to you  
In cases of murder:  
The free for the free,  
The slave for the slave,  
The woman for the woman.  
But if any remission  
Is made by the brother  
Of the slain, then grant  
Any reasonable demand,  
And compensate him

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

With handsome gratitude.  
This is a concession  
And a Mercy  
From your Lord.  
After this whoever  
Exceeds the limits  
Shall be in grave penalty.

179\. In the Law of Equality  
There is (saving of) Life  
To you, O ye men of understanding;  
That ye may  
Restrain yourselves.

180\. It is prescribed,  
When death approaches  
Any of you, if he leave  
Any goods, that he make a bequest  
To parents and next of kin,  
According to reasonable usage;  
This is due  
From the God-fearing.

181\. If anyone changes the bequest  
After hearing it,  
The guilt shall be on those  
Who make the change.  
For God hears and knows  
(All things).

182\. But if anyone fears  
Partiality or wrong-doing  
On the part of the testator,  
And makes peace between

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

(The parties concerned),  
There is no wrong in him:  
For God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 23.

183\. O ye who believe!  
Fasting is prescribed to you  
As it was prescribed  
To those before you,  
That ye may (learn)  
Self-restraint,—

184\. (Fasting) for a fixed  
Number of days;  
But if any of you is ill,  
Or on a journey,  
The prescribed number  
(Should be made up)  
From days later.  
For those who can do it  
(With hardship), is a ransom,  
The feeding of one  
That is indigent.  
But he that will give  
More, of his own free will,—  
It is better for him.  
And it is better for you  
That ye fast,  
If ye only knew.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

185\. Rama<u>dh</u>ān is the (month)  
In which was sent down  
The Qur-ān, as a guide  
To mankind, also clear (Signs)  
For guidance and judgment  
(Between right and wrong).  
So every one of you  
Who is present (at his home)  
During that month  
Should spend it in fasting,  
But if any one is ill,  
Or on a journey,  
The prescribed period  
(Should be made up)  
By days later.  
God intends every facility  
For you; He does not want  
To put you to difficulties.  
(He wants you) to complete  
The prescribed period,  
And to glorify Him  
In that He has guided you;  
And perchance ye shall be grateful.

186\. When My servants  
Ask thee concerning Me,  
I am indeed  
Close (to them): I listen  
To the prayer of every  
Suppliant when he calleth on Me:  
Let them also, with a will,  
Listen to My call,  
And believe in Me:  
That they may walk  
In the right way.

187\. Permitted to you,  
On the night of the fasts,  
Is the approach to your wives.  
They are your garments

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

And ye are their garments.  
God knoweth what ye  
Used to do secretly among yourselves;  
But He turned to you  
And forgave you;  
So now associate with them,  
And seek what God  
Hath ordained for you,  
And eat and drink,  
Until the white thread  
Of dawn appear to you  
Distinct from its black thread;  
Then complete your fast  
Till the night appears;  
But do not associate  
With your wives  
While ye are in retreat  
In the mosques. Those are  
Limits (set by) God:  
Approach not nigh thereto.  
Thus doth God make clear  
His Signs to men: that  
They may learn self-restraint.

188\. And do not eat up  
Your property among yourselves  
For vanities, nor use it  
As bait for the judges,  
With intent that ye may  
Eat up wrongfully and knowingly

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

A little of (other) people's property.

##### SECTION 24.

189\. They ask thee  
Concerning the New Moons.  
Say: They are but signs  
To mark fixed periods of time  
In (the affairs of) men,  
And for Pilgrimage.  
It is no virtue if ye enter  
Your houses from the back:  
It is virtue if ye fear God.  
Enter houses  
Through the proper doors:  
And fear God:  
That ye may prosper.

190\. Fight in the cause of God  
Those who fight you,  
But do not transgress limits;  
For God loveth not transgressors.

191\. And slay them  
Wherever ye catch them,  
And turn them out  
From where they have

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

Turned you out;  
For tumult and oppression  
Are worse than slaughter;  
But fight them not  
At the Sacred Mosque,  
Unless they (first)  
Fight you there;  
But if they fight you,  
Slay them.  
Such is the reward  
Of those who suppress faith.

192\. But if they cease,  
God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

193\. And fight them on  
Until there is no more  
Tumult or oppression,  
And there prevail  
Justice and faith in God;  
But if they cease,  
Let there be no hostility  
Except to those  
Who practise oppression.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

194\. The prohibited month  
For the prohibited month,—  
And so for all things prohibited,—  
There is the law of equality.  
If then any one transgresses  
The prohibition against you,  
Transgress ye likewise  
Against him.  
But fear God, and know  
That God is with those  
Who restrain themselves.

195\. And spend of your substance  
In the cause of God,  
And make not your own hands  
Contribute to (your) destruction;  
But do good;  
For God loveth those  
Who do good.

196\. And complete  
The .*Hajj* or *‘umra* 

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

In the service of God.  
But if ye are prevented  
(From completing it),  
Send an offering  
For sacrifice,  
Such as ye may find,  
And do not shave your heads  
Until the offering reaches  
The place of sacrifice.  
And if any of you is ill,  
Or has an ailment in his scalp,  
(Necessitating shaving),  
(He should) in compensation  
Either fast, or feed the poor,  
Or offer sacrifice;  
And when ye are  
In peaceful conditions (again),  
If any one wishes  
To continue the *‘umra*   
On to the *ḥajj*,  
He must make an offering,  
Such as he can afford,  
But if he cannot afford it,  
He should fast  
Three days during the *ḥajj*  
And seven days on his return,  
Making ten days in all.  
This is for those  
Whose household  
Is not in (the precincts  
Of) the Sacred Mosque.  
And fear God,  
And know that God.  
Is strict in punishment?

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

##### SECTION 25.

197\. For *Ḥajj*   
Are the months well known.  
If any one undertakes  
That duty therein,  
Let there be no obscenity,  
Nor wickedness,  
Nor wrangling  
In the *Ḥajj*.  
And whatever good  
Ye do, (be sure)  
God knoweth it.  
And take a provision  
(With you) for the journey,  
But the best of provisions  
Is right conduct.  
So fear Me,  
O ye that are wise.

198\. It is no crime in you  
If ye seek of the bounty  
Of your Lord (during pilgrimage).  
Then when ye pour down  
From (Mount) ’Arafāt,  
Celebrate the praises of God  
At the Sacred Monument,

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

And celebrate His praises  
As He has directed you,  
Even though, before this,  
Ye went astray.

199\. Then pass on  
At a quick pace from the place  
Whence it is usual  
For the multitude  
So to do, and ask  
For God's forgiveness.  
For God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

200\. So when ye have  
Accomplished your holy rites,  
Celebrate the praises of God,  
As ye used to celebrate  
The praises of your fathers,—  
Yea, with far more  
Heart and soul.  
There are men who say:  
"Our [Lord](errata.htm#0.md)! Give us  
(Thy bounties) in this world!"  
But they will have  
No portion in the Hereafter.

201\. And there are men who say:  
"Our Lord! Give us  
Good in this world  
And good in the Hereafter,  
And defend us  
From the torment  
Of the Fire!"

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

202\. To these will be allotted  
What they have earned;  
And God is quick in account.

203\. Celebrate the praises of God  
During the Appointed Days.  
But if any one hastens  
To leave in two days,  
There is no blame on him,  
And if any one stays on,  
There is no blame on him,  
If his aim is to do right.  
Then fear God, and know  
That ye will surely  
Be gathered unto Him.

204\. There is the type of man  
Whose speech  
About this world's life  
May dazzle thee,  
And he calls God to witness  
About what is in his heart;  
Yet is he the most contentious  
Of enemies.

205\. When he turns his back,  
His aim everywhere  
Is to spread mischief  
Through the earth and destroy  
Crops and cattle.  
But God loveth not mischief.

206\. When it is said to him,  
"Fear God,"  
He is led by arrogance  
To (more) crime.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

Enough for him is Hell;—  
An evil bed indeed  
(To lie on)!

207\. And there is the type of man  
Who gives his life  
To earn the pleasure of God;  
And God is full of kindness  
To (His) devotees.

208\. O ye who believe!  
Enter into Islam  
Whole-heartedly;  
And follow not  
The footsteps  
Of the Evil One;  
For he is to you  
An avowed enemy.

209\. If ye backslide  
After the clear (Signs)  
Have come to you,  
Then know that God  
Is Exalted in Power, Wise.

210\. Will they wait  
Until God comes to them  
In canopies of clouds,  
With angels (in His train)  
And the question  
Is (thus) settled?  
But to God  
Do all questions  
Go back (for decision).

##### SECTION 26.

211\. Ask the Children of Israel  
How many Clear (Signs)

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

We have sent them.  
But if any one,  
After God's favour  
Has come to him,  
Substitutes (something else),  
God is strict in punishment.

212\. The life of this world  
Is alluring to those  
Who reject faith,  
And they scoff at those  
Who believe.  
But the righteous  
Will be above them  
On the Day of Resurrection;  
For God bestows His abundance  
Without measure  
On whom He will.

213\. Mankind was one single nation,  
And God sent Messengers  
With glad tidings and warnings;  
And with them He sent  
The Book in truth,  
To judge between people  
In matters wherein  
They differed;  
But the People of the Book,  
After the clear Signs  
Came to them, did not differ  
Among themselves,  
Except through selfish contumacy.  
God by His Grace  
Guided the Believers  
To the Truth,  
Concerning that  
Wherein they differed.  
For God guides  
Whom He will  
To a path  
That is straight.

214\. Or do ye think  
That ye shall enter

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

The Garden (of Bliss)  
Without such (trials)  
As came to those  
Who passed away  
Before you?  
They encountered  
Suffering and adversity,  
And were so shaken in spirit  
That even the Apostle  
And those of faith  
Who were with him  
Cried: "When (will come)  
The help of God?"  
Ah! Verily, the help of God  
Is (always) near!

215\. They ask thee  
What they should spend  
(In charity). Say: Whatever  
Ye spend that is good,  
Is for parents and kindred  
And orphans  
And those in want  
And for wayfarers.  
And whatever ye do  
That is good,—God  
Knoweth it well.

216\. Fighting is prescribed  
For you, and ye dislike it.  
But it is possible  
That ye dislike a thing  
Which is good for you,  
And that ye love a thing  
Which is bad for you.  
But God knoweth,  
And ye know not.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

##### SECTION 27.

217\. They ask thee  
Concerning fighting  
In the Prohibited Month.  
Say: "Fighting therein  
Is a grave (offence);  
But graver is it  
In the sight of God  
To prevent access  
To the path of God,  
To deny Him,  
To prevent access  
To the Sacred Mosque,  
And drive out its members.  
Tumult and oppression  
Are worse than slaughter.  
Nor will they cease  
Fighting you until  
They turn you back  
From your faith  
If they can.  
And if any of you  
Turn back from their faith  
And die in unbelief,  
Their works will bear no fruit  
In this life  
And in the Hereafter;  
They will be  
Companions of the Fire  
And will abide therein.

218\. Those who believed  
And those who suffered exile  
And fought (and strove and struggled)  
In the path of God,—  
They have the hope  
Of the Mercy of God;  
And God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

219\. They ask thee  
Concerning wine and gambling.  
Say: "In them is great sin,  
And some profit, for men;  
But the sin is greater  
Than the profit."  
Whey ask thee how much  
They are to spend;  
Say: "What is beyond  
Your needs."  
Thus doth God  
Make clear to you  
His Signs: in order that  
Ye may consider—

220\. (Their bearings) on  
This life and the Hereafter.

They ask thee  
Concerning orphans.  
Say: "The best thing to do  
Is what is for their good;  
If ye mix  
Their affairs with yours,  
They are your brethren;  
But God knows

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

The man who means mischief  
From the man who means good.  
And if God had wished,  
He could have put you  
Into difficulties: He is indeed  
Exalted in Power, Wise.

221\. Do not marry  
Unbelieving women (idolaters),  
Until they believe:  
A slave woman who believes  
Is better than an unbelieving woman,  
Even though she allure you.  
Nor marry (your girls)  
To unbelievers until  
They believe:  
A man slave who believes  
Is better than an unbeliever,  
Even though he allure you.  
Unbelievers do (but)  
Beckon you to the Fire.  
But God beckons by His Grace  
To the Garden (of Bliss)  
And forgiveness,  
And makes His Signs  
Clear to mankind:  
That they may  
Celebrate His praise.

##### SECTION 28.

222\. They ask thee  
Concerning women's courses.  
Say: They are  
A hurt and a pollution:

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

So keep away from women  
In their courses, and do not  
Approach them until  
They are clean.  
But when they have  
Purified themselves,  
Ye may approach them  
In any manner, time, or place  
Ordained for you by God.  
For God loves those  
Who turn to Him constantly  
And He loves those  
Who keep themselves pure and clean,

223\. Your wives are  
As a tilth unto you;  
So approach your tilth  
When or how ye will;  
But do some good act  
For your souls beforehand;  
And fear God,  
And know that ye are  
To meet Him (in the Hereafter),  
And give (these) good tidings  
To those who believe.

224\. And make not  
God's (name) an excuse  
In your oaths against  
Doing good, or acting rightly,  
Or making peace  
Between persons;

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

For God is One  
Who heareth and knoweth  
All things.

225\. God will not  
Call you to account  
For thoughtlessness  
In your oaths,  
But for the intention  
In your hearts;  
And He is  
Oft-forgiving  
Most Forbearing.

226\. For those who take  
An oath for abstention  
From their wives,  
A waiting for four months  
Is ordained;  
If then they return,  
God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

227\. But if their intention  
Is firm for divorce,  
God heareth  
And knoweth all things.

228\. Divorced women  
Shall wait concerning themselves

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

For three monthly periods.  
Nor is it lawful for them  
To hide what God  
Hath created in their wombs,  
If they have faith  
In God and the Last Day.  
And their husbands  
Have the better right  
To take them back  
In that period, if  
They wish for reconciliation.  
And women shall have rights  
Similar to the rights  
Against them, according  
To what is equitable;  
But men have a degree  
(Of advantage) over them.  
And God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

##### SECTION 29.

229\. A divorce is only  
Permissible twice: after that,  
The parties should either hold  
Together on equitable terms,  
Or separate with kindness.  
It is not lawful for you,  
(Men), to take back  
Any of your gifts (from your wives)  
Except when both parties  
Fear that they would be  
Unable to keep the limits

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

Ordained by God.  
If ye (judges) do indeed  
Fear that they would be  
Unable to keep the limits  
Ordained by God,  
There is no blame on either  
Of them if she give  
Something for her freedom.  
These are the limits  
Ordained by God;  
So do not transgress them  
If any do transgress  
The limits ordained by God,  
Such persons wrong  
(Themselves as well as others).

230\. So if a husband  
Divorces his wife (irrevocably),  
He cannot, after that,  
Re-marry her until  
After she has married  
Another husband and  
He has divorced her.  
In that case there is  
No blame on either of them  
If they re-unite, provided  
They feel that they  
Can keep the limits  
Ordained by God.  
Such are the limits  
Ordained by God,  
Which He makes plain  
To those who understand.

231\. When ye divorce  
Women, and they fulfil

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

The term of their (*’Iddat*),  
Either take them back  
On equitable terms  
Or set them free  
On equitable terms;  
But do not take them back  
To injure them, (or) to take  
Undue advantage;  
If any one does that,  
He wrongs his own soul.  
Do not treat God's Signs  
As a jest,  
But solemnly rehearse  
God's favours on you,  
And the fact that He  
Sent down to you  
The Book  
And Wisdom,  
For your instruction.  
And fear God,  
And know that God  
Is well acquainted  
With all things.

##### SECTION 30.

232\. When ye divorce  
Women, and they fulfil  
The term of their (*’Iddat*),  
Do not prevent them  
From marrying  
Their (former) husbands,  
If they mutually agree  
On equitable terms.  
This instruction  
Is for all amongst you,  
Who believe in God  
And the Last Day.  
That is (the course

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

Making for) most virtue  
And purity amongst you,  
And God knows,  
And ye know not.

233\. The mothers shall give suck  
To their offspring  
For two whole years,  
If the father desires  
To complete the term.  
But he shall bear the cost  
Of their food and clothing  
On equitable terms.  
No soul shall have  
A burden laid on it  
Greater than it can bear.  
No mother shall be  
Treated unfairly  
On account of her child.  
Nor father  
On account of his child,  
An heir shall be chargeable  
In the same way.  
If they both decide  
On weaning,  
By mutual consent,  
And after due consultation,  
There is no blame on them.  
If ye decide  
On a foster-mother  
For your offspring,  
There is no blame on you,  
Provided ye pay (the mother)  
What ye offered,  
On equitable terms.  
But fear God and know  
That God sees well  
What ye do.

234\. If any of you die  
And leave widows behind,

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

They shall wait concerning themselves  
Four months and ten days:  
When they have fulfilled  
Their term, there is no blame  
On you if they dispose  
Of themselves in a just  
And reasonable manner.  
And God is well acquainted  
With what ye do.

235\. There is no blame  
On you if ye make  
An offer of betrothal  
Or hold it in your hearts.  
God knows that ye  
Cherish them in your hearts:  
But do not make a secret contract  
With them except in terms  
Honourable, nor resolve on the tie  
Of marriage till the term  
Prescribed is fulfilled.  
And know that God  
Knoweth what is in your hearts,  
And take heed of Him;  
And know that God is  
Oft-forgiving, Most Forbearing.

##### SECTION 31.

236\. There is no blame on you  
If ye divorce women  
Before consummation  
Or the fixation of their dower;  
But bestow on them  
(A suitable gift),  
The wealthy  
According to his means,  
And the poor  
According to his means;—

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

A gift of a reasonable amount  
Is due from those  
Who wish to do the right thing.

237\. And if ye divorce them  
Before consummation,  
But after the fixation  
Of a dower for them,  
Then the half of the dower  
(Is due to them), unless  
They remit it  
Or (the man's half) is remitted  
By him in whose hands  
Is the marriage tie;  
And the remission  
(Of the man's half)  
Is the nearest to righteousness.  
And do not forget  
Liberality between yourselves.  
For God sees well  
All that ye do.

238\. Guard strictly  
Your (habit of) prayers,  
Especially the Middle Prayer;  
And stand before God  
In a devout (frame of mind).

239\. If ye fear (an enemy),  
Pray on foot, or riding,  
(As may be most convenient),  
But when ye are  
In security, celebrate  
God's praises in the manner  
He has taught you,  
Which ye knew not (before).

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

240\. Those of you  
Who die and leave widows  
Should bequeath  
For their widows  
A year's maintenance  
And residence;  
But if they leave  
(The residence),  
There is no blame on you  
For what they do  
With themselves,  
Provided it is reasonable.  
And God is Exalted in Power, Wise.

241\. For divorced women  
Maintenance (should be provided)  
On a reasonable (scale).  
This is a duty  
On the righteous.

242\. Thus doth God  
Make clear His Signs  
To you: in order that  
Ye may understand.

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

##### SECTION 32.

243\. Didst thou not  
Turn by vision to those  
Who abandoned their homes,  
Though they were thousands  
(In number), for fear of death?  
God said to them: "Die":  
Then He restored them to life.  
For God is full of bounty  
To mankind, but  
Most of them are ungrateful.

244\. Then fight in the cause  
Of God, and know that God  
Heareth and knoweth all things.

245\. Who is he  
That will loan to God  
A beautiful loan, which God  
Will double unto his credit  
And multiply many times?  
It is God that giveth (you)  
Want or Plenty,  
And to Him shall be  
Your return.

246\. Hast thou not  
Turned thy vision to the Chiefs  
Of the Children of Israel  
After (the time of) Moses?

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

They said to a Prophet  
(That was) among them:  
"Appoint for us a King, that we  
May fight in the cause of God."  
He said: "Is it not possible,  
If ye were commanded  
To fight, that that ye  
Will not fight?" They said:  
"How could we refuse  
To fight in the cause of God,  
Seeing that we were turned out  
Of our homes and our families?"  
But when they were commanded  
To fight, they turned back,  
Except a small band  
Among them. But God  
Has full knowledge of those  
Who do wrong.

247\. Their Prophet said to them:  
"God hath appointed  
Talut as king over you."  
They said: "How can he  
Exercise authority over us  
When we are better fitted  
Than he to exercise authority,  
And he is not even gifted,  
With wealth in abundance?"  
He said: "God hath  
Chosen him above you,  
And hath gifted him  
Abundantly with knowledge  
And bodily prowess: God

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

Granteth His authority to whom  
He pleaseth. God careth  
For all, and He knoweth  
All things."

248\. And (further) their Prophet  
Said to them: "A Sign  
Of his authority  
Is that there shall come  
To you the Ark of the Covenant,  
With (an assurance) therein  
Of security from your Lord,  
And the relics left  
By the family of Moses  
And the family of Aaron,  
Carried by angels.  
In this is a Symbol  
For you if ye indeed  
Have faith."

##### SECTION 33.

249\. When Talūt set forth  
With the armies, he said:  
"God will test you  
At the stream: if any  
Drinks of its water,  
He goes not with my army:  
Only those who taste not  
Of it go with me:  
A mere sip out of the hand  
Is excused." But they all  
Drank of it, except a few.  
When they crossed the river,—  
He and the faithful ones with him,  
They said: "This day  
We cannot cope  
With Goliath and his forces."

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

But those who were convinced  
That they must meet God,  
Said: "How oft, by God's will,  
Hath a small force  
Vanquished a big one?  
God is with those  
Who steadfastly persevere."

250\. When they advanced  
To meet Goliath and his forces,  
They prayed: "Our Lord  
Pour out constancy on us  
And make our steps firm:  
Help us against those  
That reject faith."

251\. By God's will,  
They routed them;  
And David slew Goliath;  
And God gave him  
Power and wisdom  
And taught him  
Whatever (else) He willed,  
And did not God  
Check one set of people  
By means of another,  
The earth would indeed  
Be full of mischief:  
But God is full of bounty  
To all the worlds.

252\. These are the Signs  
Of God: we rehearse them  
To thee in truth: verily  
Thou art one of the Apostles.

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

253\. Those apostles  
Were endowed with gifts,  
Some above others  
To one of them God spoke;  
Others He raised  
To degrees (of honour);  
To Jesus the son of Mary  
We gave Clear (Signs),  
And strengthened him  
With the holy spirit.  
If God had so willed,  
Succeeding generations  
Would not have fought  
Among each other, after  
Clear (Signs) had come to them,  
But they (chose) to wrangle,  
Some believing and Others  
Rejecting. If God had so willed,  
They would not have fought  
Each other; but God  
Fulfilleth His plan.

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

##### SECTION 34.

254\. O ye who believe!  
Spend out of (the bounties)  
We have provided for you,  
Before the Day comes  
When no bargaining  
(Will avail), nor friendship  
Nor intercession.  
Those who reject Faith—they  
Are the wrong-doers.

255\. God! There is no god  
But He,—the Living,  
The Self-subsisting, Eternal.  
No slumber can seize Him  
Nor sleep. His are all things  
In the heavens and on earth.  
Who is there can intercede  
In His presence except  
As He permitteth? He knoweth  
What (appeareth to His creatures

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

As) Before or After  
Or Behind them.  
Nor shall they compass  
Aught of His knowledge  
Except as He willeth.  
His Throne doth extend  
Over the heavens  
And the earth, and He feeleth  
No fatigue in guarding,  
And preserving them  
For He is the Most High,  
The Supreme (in glory).

256\. Let there be no compulsion  
In religion: Truth stands out  
Clear from Error: whoever  
Rejects Evil and believes  
In God hath grasped  
The most trustworthy  
Hand-hold, that never breaks.  
And God heareth  
And knoweth all things.

257\. God is the Protector  
Of those who have faith:

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

From the depths of darkness  
He will lead them forth  
Into light. Of those  
Who reject faith the patrons  
Are the Evil Ones: from light  
They will lead them forth  
Into the depths of darkness.  
They will be Companions  
Of the fire, to dwell therein  
(For ever).

##### SECTION 35.

258\. Hast thou not  
Turned thy vision to one  
Who disputed with Abraham  
About his Lord, because  
God had granted him  
Power? Abraham said:  
"My Lord is He Who  
Giveth life and death."  
He said: "I give life and death."  
Said Abraham: "But it is God  
That causeth the sun  
To rise from the East:  
Do thou then cause him  
To rise from the West."  
Thus was he confounded  
Who (in arrogance) rejected  
Faith. Nor doth God  
Give guidance  
To a people unjust.

259\. Or (take) the similitude  
Of one who passed

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

By a hamlet, all in ruins  
To its roofs. He said:  
"Oh! how shall God  
Bring it (ever) to life,  
After (this) its death?"  
But God caused him  
To die for a hundred years,  
Then raised him up (again).  
He said: "How long  
Didst thou tarry (thus)?"  
He said: "(Perhaps) a day  
Or part of a day." He said:  
"Nay, thou hast tarried  
Thus a hundred years;  
But look at thy food  
And thy drink; they show  
No signs of age; and look  
At thy donkey: and that  
We may make of thee  
A Sign unto the people,  
Look further at the bones,  
How We bring them together  
And clothe them with flesh."  
When this was shown clearly  
To him, he said: "I know  
That God hath power  
Over all things."

260\. Behold! Abraham said:  
"My Lord! Show me how  
Thou givest life to the dead."  
He said: "Dost thou not  
Then believe?" He said:  
"Yea! but to satisfy

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

My own understanding."  
He said: "Take four birds;  
Tame them to turn to thee;  
Put a portion of them  
On every hill, and call to them:  
They will come to thee  
(Flying) with speed.  
Then know that God  
Is Exalted in Power, Wise."

##### SECTION 36.

261\. The parable of those  
Who spend their substance  
In the way of God is that  
Of a grain of corn: it groweth  
Seven ears, and each ear  
Hath a hundred grains.  
God giveth manifold increase  
To whom He pleaseth:  
And God careth for all  
And He knoweth all things

262\. Those who spend  
Their substance in the cause  
Of God, and follow not up  
Their gifts with reminders  
Of their generosity  
Or with injury,—for them  
Their reward is with their Lord:  
On them shall be no fear,  
Nor shall they grieve.

263\. Kind words  
And the covering of faults

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

Are better than charity  
Followed by injury.  
God is Free of all wants,  
And He is most Forbearing.

264\. O ye who believe!  
Cancel not your charity  
By reminders of your generosity  
Or by injury,—like those  
Who spend their substance  
To be seen of men,  
But believe neither  
In God nor in the Last Day.  
They are in Parable like a hard,  
Barren rock, on which  
Is a little soil: on it  
Falls heavy rain,  
Which leaves it  
(Just) a bare stone.  
They will be able to do nothing  
With aught they have earned.  
And God guideth not  
Those who reject faith.

265\. And the likeness of those  
Who spend their substance,  
Seeking to please God  
And to strengthen their souls,  
Is as a garden, high  
And fertile: heavy rain  
Falls on it but makes it yield  
A double increase  
Of harvest, and if it receives not  
Heavy rain, light moisture  
Sufficeth it. God seeth well  
Whatever ye do.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

266\. Does any of you wish  
That he should have a garden  
With date-palms and vines  
And streams flowing  
Underneath, and all kinds  
Of fruit, while he is stricken  
With old age, and his children  
Are not strong (enough  
To look after themselves)—  
That it should be caught  
In a whirlwind,  
With fire therein,  
And be burnt up?  
Thus doth God make clear  
To you (His) Signs;  
That ye may consider.

##### SECTION 37.

267\. O ye who believe!  
Give of the good things  
Which ye have (honourably) earned,  
And of the fruits of the earth  
Which We have produced

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

For you, and do not even aim  
At getting anything  
Which is bad, in order that  
Out of it ye may give away  
Something, when ye yourselves  
Would not receive it  
Except with closed eyes.  
And know that God  
Is Free of all wants,  
And Worthy of all praise.

268\. The Evil One threatens  
You with poverty  
And bids you to conduct  
Unseemly. God promiseth  
You His forgiveness  
And bounties.  
And God careth for all  
And He knoweth all things.

269\. He granteth wisdom  
To whom He pleaseth;  
And he to whom wisdom  
Is granted receiveth  
Indeed a benefit overflowing;  
But none will grasp the Message  
But men of understanding.

270\. And whatever ye spend  
In charity or devotion,  
Be sure God knows it all.  
But the wrong-doers  
Have no helpers.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

271\. If ye disclose (acts  
Of) charity, even so  
It is well,  
But if ye conceal them,  
And make them reach  
Those (really) in need,  
That is best for you:  
It will remove from you  
Some of your (stains  
Of) evil. And God  
Is well acquainted  
With what ye do.

272\. It is not required  
Of thee (O Apostle),  
To set them on the right path,  
But God sets on the right path  
Whom He pleaseth.  
Whatever of good ye give  
Benefits your own souls,  
And ye shall only do so  
Seeking the "Face"  
Of God. Whatever good  
Ye give, shall be  
Rendered back to you,  
And ye shall not  
Be dealt with unjustly.

273\. (Charity is) for those  
In need, who, in God's cause  
Are restricted (from travel),  
And cannot move about

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

In the land, seeking  
(For trade or work):  
The ignorant man thinks,  
Because of their modesty,  
That they are free from want.  
Thou shaltḳnow them  
By their (unfailing) mark:  
They beg not importunately  
From all and sundry.  
And whatever of good  
Ye give, be assured  
God knoweth it well.

##### SECTION 38.

274\. Whose who (in charity)  
Spend of their goods  
By night and by day,  
In secret and in public,  
Have their reward  
With their Lord:  
On them shall be no fear,  
Nor shall they grieve.

275\. Those who devour usury  
Will not stand except  
As stands one whom  
The Evil One by his touch  
Hath driven to madness.  
That is because they say:  
"Trade is like usury,"  
But God hath permitted trade

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

And forbidden usury.  
Those who after receiving  
Direction from their Lord,  
Desist, shall be pardoned  
For the past; their case  
Is for God (to judge);  
But those who repeat  
(The offence) are Companions  
Of the Fire: they will  
Abide therein (for ever).

276\. God will deprive  
Usury of all blessing,  
But will give increase  
For deeds of charity:  
For He loveth not  
Creatures ungrateful  
And wicked.

277\. Those who believe,  
And do deeds of righteousness,  
And establish regular prayers  
And regular charity,  
Will have their reward  
With their Lord:  
On them shall be no fear,  
Nor shall they grieve.

278\. O ye who believe!  
Fear God, and give up  
What remains of your demand  
For usury, if ye are  
Indeed believers.

279\. If ye do it not,  
Take notice of war  
From God and His Apostle:  
But if ye turn back,  
Ye shall have  
Your capital sums:  
Deal not unjustly,  
And ye shall not  
Be dealt with unjustly.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

280\. If the debtor is  
In a difficulty,  
Grant him time  
Till it is easy  
For him to repay.  
But if ye remit it  
By way of charity,  
That is best for you  
If ye only knew.

281\. And fear the Day  
When ye shall be  
Brought back to God.  
Then shall every soul  
Be paid what it earned,  
And none shall be  
Dealt with unjustly.

##### SECTION 39.

282\. O ye who believe!  
When ye deal with each other,  
In transactions involving  
Future obligations  
In a fixed period of time,  
Reduce them to writing  
Let a scribe write down  
Faithfully as between  
The parties: let not the scribe  
Refuse to write: as God  
Has taught him,  
So let him write.  
Let him who incurs  
The liability dictate,  
But let him fear  
His Lord God,  
And not diminish  
Aught of what he owes.  
If the party liable  
Is mentally deficient,

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

Or weak, or unable  
Himself to dictate,  
Let his guardian  
Dictate faithfully.  
And get two witnesses,  
Out of your own men,  
And if there are not two men,  
Then a man and two women,  
Such as ye choose,  
For witnesses,  
So that if one of them errs,  
The other can remind her.  
The witnesses  
Should not refuse  
When they are called on  
(For evidence).  
Disdain not to reduce  
To writing (your contract)  
For a future period,  
Whether it be small  
Or big: it is juster  
In the sight of God,  
More suitable as evidence,  
And more convenient  
To prevent doubts  
Among yourselves  
But if it be a transaction  
Which ye carry out  
On the spot among yourselves,  
There is no blame on you  
If ye reduce it not  
To writing.  
But take witnesses  
Whenever ye make  
A commercial contract;  
And let neither scribe  
Nor witness suffer harm.  
If ye do (such harm),  
It would be wickedness  
In you. So fear God;  
For it is God  
That teaches you.  
And God is well acquainted  
With all things.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

283\. If ye are on a journey,  
And cannot find  
A scribe, a pledge  
With possession (may serve  
The purpose).  
And if one of you  
Deposits a thing  
On trust with another,  
Let the trustee  
(Faithfully) discharge  
His trust, and let him  
Fear his Lord.  
Conceal not evidence;  
For whoever conceals it,—  
His heart is tainted  
With sin. And God  
Knoweth all that ye do.

##### SECTION 40.

284\. To God belongeth all  
That is in the heavens  
And on earth. Whether  
Ye show what is in your minds  
Or conceal it, God  
Calleth you to account for it.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

He forgiveth whom He pleaseth,  
And punishefh whom He pleaseth.  
For God hath power  
Over all things.

285\. The Apostle believeth  
In what hath been revealed  
To him from his Lord,  
As do the men of faith.  
Each one (of them) believeth  
In God, His angels,  
His books, and His apostles.  
"We make no distinction (they say)  
Between one and another  
Of His apostles." And they say:  
"We hear, and we obey:  
(We seek) Thy forgiveness,  
Our Lord, and to Thee  
Is the end of all journeys."

286\. On no soul doth God  
Place a burden greater  
Than it can bear.  
It gets every good that it earns,  
And it suffers every ill that if earns.  
(Pray:) "Our Lord!  
Condemn us not  
If we forget or fall  
Into error; our Lord!  
Lay not on us a burden  
Like that which Thou  
Didst lay on those before us;

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

Our Lord! lay not on us  
A burden greater than we  
Have strength to bear.  
Blot out our sins,  
And grant us forgiveness,  
Have mercy on us.  
Thou art our Protector;  
Help us against those  
Who stand against Faith"
