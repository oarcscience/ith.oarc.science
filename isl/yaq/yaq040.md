### Sūra XL.

### *Mū-min,* or The Believer.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Hā-Mīm*.

2\. The revelation  
Of this Book  
Is from God,  
Exalted in Power,  
Full of Knowledge,—

3\. Who forgiveth Sin,  
Accepteth Repentance,  
Is Strict in Punishment,  
And hath a Long Reach  
(In all things).  
There is no god  
But He: to Him  
Is the Final Goal.

4\. None can dispute  
About the Signs of God  
But the Unbelievers.  
Let not, then,  
Their strutting about  
Through the land  
Deceive thee!

<span id="page_1263">p. 1263</span>

5\. But (there were people) before them,  
Who denied (the Signs),—  
The People of Noah,  
And the Confederates  
(Of Evil) after them;  
And every People plotted  
Against their prophet,  
To seize him, and disputed  
By means of vanities,  
Therewith to condemn  
The Truth: but it was I  
That seized them!  
And how (terrible)  
Was My Requital!

6\. Thus was the Decree  
Of thy Lord proved true  
Against the Unbelievers  
That truly they are  
Companions of the Fire!

7\. Those who sustain  
The Throne (of God)  
And those around it  
Sing Glory and Praise  
To their Lord; believe  
In Him; and implore Forgiveness  
For those who believe:  
"Our Lord! Thy Reach

<span id="page_1264">p. 1264</span>

Is over all things,  
In Mercy and Knowledge.  
Forgive, then, those who  
Turn in Repentance, and follow  
Thy Path; and preserve them  
From the Penalty  
Of the Blazing Fire!

8\. "And grant, our Lord!  
That they enter  
The Gardens of Eternity,  
Which Thou hast promised  
To them, and to the righteous  
Among their fathers,  
Their wives, and their posterity!  
For Thou art (He),  
The Exalted in Might,  
Full of Wisdom.

9\. "And preserve them  
From (all) ills;  
And any whom Thou  
Dost preserve from ills  
That Day,—on them  
Wilt Thou have bestowed  
Mercy indeed: and that  
Will be truly (for them)  
The highest Achievement".

##### SECTION 2.

10\. The Unbelievers will be  
Addressed: "Greater was  
The aversion of God to you  
Than (is), your aversion

<span id="page_1265">p. 1265</span>

To yourselves, seeing that ye  
Were called to the Faith  
And ye used to refuse."

11\. They will say: "Our Lord!  
Twice hast Thou made us  
Without life, and twice  
Hast Thou given us Life!  
Now have we recognised  
Our sins: is there  
Any way out (of this)?"

12\. (The answer will be:)  
"This is because, when  
God was invoked as  
The Only (object of worship),  
Ye did reject Faith,  
But when partners were  
Joined to Him, ye believed!  
The Command is with God,  
Most High, Most Great!"

13\. He it is Who showeth  
You His Signs, and sendeth  
Down Sustenance for you  
From the sky: but only  
Those receive admonition  
Who turn (to God).

14\. Call ye, then, upon God  
With sincere devotion to Him,

<span id="page_1266">p. 1266</span>

Even though the Unbelievers  
May detest it.

15\. Raised high above ranks  
(Or degrees),  
(He is) the Lord  
Of the Throne (of authority):  
By His Command doth He  
Send the spirit (of inspiration)  
To any of His servants  
He pleases, that it may  
Warn (men) of the Day  
Of Mutual Meeting,—

16\. The Day whereon  
They will (all) come forth:  
Not a single thing  
Concerning them is hidden  
From God. Whose will be  
The Dominion that Day?  
That of God, the One,  
The Irresistible!

17\. That Day will every soul  
Be requited for what  
It earned; no injustice  
Will there be that Day,  
For God is Swift  
In taking account.

<span id="page_1267">p. 1267</span>

18\. Warn them of the Day  
That is (ever) drawing near,  
When the Hearts will  
(Come) right up to the Throats  
To choke (them);  
No intimate friend  
Nor intercessor will the  
wrong-doers  
Have, who could be  
Listened to.

19\. (God) knows of (the tricks)  
That deceive with the eyes,  
And all that the hearts  
(Of men) conceal.

20\. And God will judge  
With (Justice and) Truth:  
But those whom (men)  
Invoke besides Him, will  
Not (be in a position)  
To judge at all.  
Verily it is God (alone)  
Who hears and sees  
(All things).

<span id="page_1268">p. 1268</span>

##### SECTION 3.

21\. Do they not travel  
Through the earth and see  
What was the End  
Of those before them  
They were even superior  
To them in strength,  
And in the traces (they  
Have left) in the land:  
But God did call them  
To account for their sins,  
And none had they  
To defend them against God.

22\. That was because there came  
To them their apostles  
With Clear (Signs),  
But they rejected them:  
So God called them  
To account: for He is  
Full of Strength,  
Strict in Punishment.

23\. Of old We sent Moses,  
With Our Signs  
And an Authority manifest,

<span id="page_1269">p. 1269</span>

24\. To Pharaoh, Hāmān,  
And Qārūn; but they  
Called (him) "a sorcerer  
Telling lies!"…

25\. Now, when he came to them  
In Truth, from Us,  
They said, "Slay the sons  
Of those who believe a  
With him, and keep alive  
Their females," but the plots  
Of Unbelievers (end) in nothing  
But errors (and delusions)!…

26\. Said Pharaoh: "Leave me  
To slay Moses; and let him  
Call on his Lord!  
What I fear is lest  
He should change your religion,  
Or lest he should cause  
Mischief to appear  
In the land!"

<span id="page_1270">p. 1270</span>

27\. Moses said: "I have indeed  
Called upon my Lord  
And your Lord  
(For protection) from every  
Arrogant one who believes not  
In the Day of Account!"

##### SECTION 4.

28\. A Believer, a man  
From among the people  
Of Pharaoh, who had concealed  
His faith, said: "Will ye  
Slay a man because he  
Says, "My Lord is God"?—  
When he has indeed come  
To you with Clear (Signs)  
From your Lord? And if  
He be a liar, on him  
Is (the sin of) his lie;  
But, if he is telling  
The Truth, then will  
Fall on you something  
Of the (calamity) of which  
He warns you: truly  
God guides not one  
Who transgresses and lies!

29\. "O my People! yours  
Is the dominion this day:

<span id="page_1271">p. 1271</span>

Ye have the upper hand  
In the land: but who  
Will help us from  
The Punishment of God,  
Should it befall us?"  
Pharaoh said: "I but  
Point out to you that  
Which I see (myself);  
Nor do I guide you  
But to the Path of Right!"

30\. Then said the man  
Who believed: "O my People!  
Truly I do fear  
For you something like  
The Day (of disaster)  
Of the Confederates (in sin)!—

31\. "Something like the fate  
Of the People of Noah,  
The ‘Ād, and the <u>Th</u>amūd,  
And those who came  
After them: but God  
Never wishes injustice  
To His Servants.

32\. "And O my People!  
I fear for you a Day  
When there will be  
Mutual calling (and wailing),—

<span id="page_1272">p. 1272</span>

33\. "A Day when ye  
Shall turn your backs  
And flee: no defender  
Shall ye have from God:  
Any whom God leaves  
To stray, there is none  
To guide…

34\. "And to you there came  
Joseph in times gone by,  
With Clear Signs, but  
Ye ceased not to doubt  
Of the (mission) for which  
He had come: at length,  
When he died, ye said:  
"No apostle will God send  
After him." Thus doth God  
Leave to stray such as  
Transgress and live in doubt,—

35\. "(Such) as dispute about  
The Signs of God,  
Without any authority  
That hath reached them.  
Grievous and odious  
(Is such conduct)  
In the sight of God  
And of the Believers.  
Thus doth God seal up  
Every heart—of arrogant  
And obstinate transgressors."

<span id="page_1273">p. 1273</span>

36\. Pharaoh said: "O Hāmān!  
Build me a lofty palace,  
That I may attain  
The ways and means—

37\. "The ways and means  
Of (reaching) the heavens,  
And that I may mount up  
To the God of Moses:  
But as far as I am concerned,  
I think (Moses) is a liar!"  
Thus was made alluring,  
In Pharaoh's eyes,  
The evil of his deeds,  
And he was hindered  
From the Path; and the plot  
Of Pharaoh led to nothing  
But perdition (for him).

##### SECTION 5.

38\. The man who believed said  
Further: "O my People!  
Follow me: I will lead  
You to the Path of Right.

39\. "O my People! This life  
Of the present is nothing  
But (temporary) convenience:  
It is the Hereafter

<span id="page_1274">p. 1274</span>

That is the Home  
That will last.

40\. "He that works evil  
Will not be requited  
But by the like thereof:  
And he that works  
A righteous deed—whether  
Man or woman—and is  
A Believer—such will enter  
The Garden (of Bliss): therein  
Will they have abundance  
Without measure.

41\. "And O my People!  
How (strange) it is  
For me to call you  
To Salvation while ye  
Call me to the Fire!

42\. "Ye do call upon me  
To blaspheme against God,  
And to join with Him  
Partners of whom I have  
No knowledge; and I  
Call you to the Exalted  
In Power, Who forgives  
Again and again!"

43\. "Without doubt ye do call  
Me to one who is not  
Fit to be called to,  
Whether in this world,

<span id="page_1275">p. 1275</span>

Or in the Hereafter;  
Our Return will be  
To God; and the Transgressors  
Will be Companions  
Of the Fire!

44\. "Soon will ye remember  
What I say to you (now).  
My (own) affair I commit  
To God: for God (ever)  
Watches over His Servants."

45\. Then God saved him  
From (every) ill that they  
Plotted (against him),  
But the brunt of the Penalty  
Encompassed on all sides  
The People of Pharaoh.

46\. In front of the Fire  
Will they be brought,  
Morning and evening:  
And (the Sentence will be)  
On the Day that  
Judgment will be established:  
"Cast ye the People  
Of Pharaoh into  
The severest Penalty!"

47\. Behold, they will dispute  
With each other in the Fire!  
The weak ones (who followed)  
Will say to those who  
Had been arrogant, "We but  
Followed you: can ye then

<span id="page_1276">p. 1276</span>

Take (on yourselves) from us  
Some share of the Fire?"

48\. Those who had been arrogant  
Will say: "We are all  
In this (Fire)! Truly,  
God has judged  
Between (His) Servants!"

49\. Those in the Fire will say  
To the Keepers of Hell:  
"Pray to your Lord  
To lighten us the Penalty  
For a Day (at least)!"

50\. They will say: "Did there  
Not come to you  
Your apostles with Clear Signs?"  
They will say, "Yes".  
They will reply, "Then  
Pray (as ye like)! But  
The Prayer of those  
Without Faith is nothing  
But (futile wandering)  
In (mazes of) error!"

<span id="page_1277">p. 1277</span>

##### SECTION 6.

51\. We will, without doubt,  
Help Our apostles and those  
Who believe, (both)  
In this world's life  
And on the Day  
When the Witnesses  
Will stand forth,—

52\. The Day when no profit  
Will it be to Wrong-doers  
To present their excuses,  
But they will (only) have  
The Curse and the Home  
Of Misery.

53\. We did aforetime give Moses  
The (Book of) Guidance,  
And We gave the Book  
In inheritance to the Children  
Of Israel,—

54\. A Guide and a Message  
To men of understanding.

55\. Patiently, then, persevere:  
For the Promise of God  
Is true: and ask forgiveness  
For thy fault, and celebrate

<span id="page_1278">p. 1278</span>

The Praises of thy Lord  
In the evening  
And in the morning.

56\. Those who dispute  
About the Signs of God  
Without any authority  
Bestowed on them,—there is  
Nothing in their breasts  
But (the quest of) greatness,  
Which they shall never  
Attain to: seek refuge,  
Then, in God: it is He  
Who hears and sees (all things).

57\. Assuredly the creation  
Of the heavens  
And the earth  
Is a greater (matter)  
Than the creation of men:  
Yet most men understand not.

58\. Not equal are the blind  
And those who (clearly) see:  
Nor are (equal) those  
Who believe and work  
Deeds of righteousness, and  
Those who do evil.  
Little do ye learn  
By admonition!

59\. The Hour will certainly come:  
Therein is no doubt:  
Yet most men believe not.

<span id="page_1279">p. 1279</span>

60\. And your Lord says:  
"Call on Me; I  
Will answer your (Prayer):  
But those who are  
Too arrogant to serve Me  
Will surely find themselves  
In Hell—in humiliation!"

##### SECTION 7.

61\. It is God Who has  
Made the Night for you,  
That ye may rest therein,  
And the Day, as that  
Which helps (you) to see.  
Verily God is Full of  
Grace and Bounty to men:  
Yet most men give  
No thanks.

62\. Such is God, your Lord,  
The Creator of all things.  
There is no god but He:  
Then how ye are delude  
Away from the Truth!

63\. Thus are deluded those  
Who are wont to reject  
The Signs of God.

64\. It is God Who has  
Made for you the earth

<span id="page_1280">p. 1280</span>

As a resting place,  
And the sky as a canopy,  
And has given you shape—  
And made your shapes  
Beautiful,—and has provided  
For you Sustenance,  
Of things pure and good;—  
Such is God your Lord.  
So Glory to God,  
The Lord of the Worlds!

65\. He is the Living (One):  
There is no god but He:  
Call upon Him, giving Him  
Sincere devotion. Praise he  
To God, Lord of the Worlds!

66\. Say: "I have been forbidden  
To invoke those whom ye  
Invoke besides God,—seeing that  
The Clear Signs have come  
To me from my Lord;  
And I have been commanded  
To bow (in Islām)  
To the Lord of the Worlds."

67\. It is He Who has  
Created you from dust,

<span id="page_1281">p. 1281</span>

Then from a sperm-drop,  
Then from a leech-like clot;  
Then does He get you  
Out (into the light)  
As a child: then lets you  
(Grow and) reach your age  
Of full strength; then  
Lets you become old,—  
Though of you there are  
Some who die before;—  
And lets you reach  
A Term appointed;  
In order that ye  
May learn wisdom.

68\. It is He Who gives Life  
And Death; and when He  
Decides upon an affair,  
He says to it, "Be",  
And it is.

##### SECTION 8.

69\. Seest thou not those  
That dispute concerning  
The Signs of God?  
How are they turned away  
(From Reality)?—

70\. Those who reject the Book  
And the (revelations) with which  
We sent Our apostles:  
But soon shall they know,—

<span id="page_1282">p. 1282</span>

71\. When the yokes (shall be)  
Round their necks,  
And the chains;  
They shall be dragged along—

72\. In the boiling fetid fluid  
Then in the Fire  
Shall they be burned;

73\. Then shall it be said  
To them: "Where are  
The (deities) to which  
Ye gave part-worship—

74\. "In derogation of God?"  
They will reply: "They have  
Left us in the lurch:  
Nay, we invoked not,  
Of old, anything (that had  
Real existence)." Thus  
Does God leave  
The Unbelievers to stray.

75\. "That was because  
Ye were wont to rejoice  
On the earth in things  
Other than the Truth,  
And that ye were wont  
To be insolent.

76\. "Enter ye the gates  
Of Hell, to dwell therein:  
And evil is (this) abode  
Of the arrogant!"

<span id="page_1283">p. 1283</span>

77\. So persevere in patience;  
For the Promise of God  
Is true: and whether  
We show thee (in this life)  
Some part of what We  
Promise them,—or We  
Take thy soul (to Our Mercy)  
(Before that),—(in any case)  
It is to Us that  
They shall (all) return.

78\. We did aforetime send  
Apostles before thee: of them  
There are some whose story  
We have related to thee,  
And some whose story  
We have not related  
To thee. It was not  
(Possible) for any apostle  
To bring a Sign except  
By the leave of God:  
But when the Command  
Of God issued,  
The matter was decided  
In truth and justice,  
And there perished,  
There and then, those  
Who stood on Falsehoods.

##### SECTION 9.

79\. It is God who made  
Cattle for you, that ye

<span id="page_1284">p. 1284</span>

May use some for riding  
And some for food;

80\. And there are (other) advantages  
In them for you (besides);  
That ye may through them  
Attain to any need  
(There may be) in your hearts;  
And on them and on ships  
Ye are carried.

81\. And He shows you (always)  
His Signs: then which  
Of the Signs of God  
Will ye deny?

82\. Do they not travel through  
The earth and see what  
Was the End of those  
Before them? They were  
More numerous than these  
And superior in strength  
And in the traces  
(They have left) in the land:  
Yet all that they accomplished  
Was of no profit to them.

83\. For when their apostles  
Came to them  
With Clear Signs, they exulted  
In such knowledge (and skill)

<span id="page_1285">p. 1285</span>

As they had; but  
That very (Wrath) at which  
They were wont to scoff  
Hemmed them in.

84\. But when they saw  
Our Punishment, they said:  
"We believe in God,—  
The One God—and we  
Reject the partners we used  
To join with Him."

85\. But their professing the Faith  
When they (actually) saw  
Our Punishment was not going  
To profit them.  
(Such has been) God's way  
Of dealing with His servants  
(From the most ancient times).  
And even thus did  
The rejecters of God  
Perish (utterly)!

<span id="page_1286">p. 1286</span>
