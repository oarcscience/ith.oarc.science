### Sūra IX.

### *Tauba* (Repentance) or *Barāat* (Immunity).

1\. A (declaration) of immunity  
From God and His Apostle,  
To those of the Pagans  
With whom ye have contracted  
Mutual alliances:—

2\. Go ye, then, for four months,  
Backwards and forwards,  
(As ye will), throughout the land,  
But know ye that ye cannot  
Frustrate God (lay your falsehood)  
But that God will cover  
With shame those who reject Him.

3\. And an announcement from God  
And His Apostle, to the people  
(Assembled) on the day  
Of the Great Pilgrimage,—  
That God and His Apostle  
Dissolve (treaty) obligations  
With the Pagans.  
If, then, ye repent,  
It were best for you;  
But if ye turn away,

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

Know ye that ye cannot  
Frustrate God. And proclaim  
A grievous penalty to those  
Who reject Faith.

4\. (But the treaties are)not dissolved  
With those Pagans with whom  
Ye have entered into alliance  
And who have not subsequently  
Failed you in aught,  
Nor aided any one against you.  
So fulfil your engagements  
With them to the end  
Of their term: for God  
Loveth the righteous.

5\. But when the forbidden months  
Are past, then fight and slay  
The Pagans wherever ye find them,  
And seize them, beleaguer them,  
And lie in wait for them  
In every stratagem (of war);  
But if they repent,  
And establish regular prayers  
And practise regular charity,  
Then open the way for them:  
For God is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

<span id="page_440">p. 440</span>

6\. If one amongst the Pagans  
Ask thee for asylum,  
Grant it to him,  
So that he may hear the Word  
Of God; and then escort him  
To where he can be secure.  
That is because they are  
Men without knowledge.

##### SECTION 2.

7\. How can there be a league,  
Before God and His Apostle,  
With the Pagans, except those  
With whom ye made a treaty  
Near the Sacred Mosque?  
As long as these stand true  
To you, stand ye true to them:  
For God doth love the righteous.

8\. How (can there be such a league),  
Seeing that if they get an advantage  
Over you, they respect not  
In you the ties either of kinship

<span id="page_441">p. 441</span>

Or of covenant? With (fair words  
From) their mouths they entice you,  
But their hearts are averse  
From you; and most of them  
Are rebellious and wicked.

9\. The Signs of God have they sold  
For a miserable price,  
And (many) have they hindered  
From His Way: evil indeed  
Are the deeds they have done.

10\. In a Believer they respect not  
The ties either of kinship  
Or of covenant! It is they  
Who have transgressed all bounds.

11\. But (even so), if they repent,  
Establish regular prayers,  
And practise regular charity,—  
They are your brethren in Faith:  
(Thus) do We explain the Signs  
in detail, for those who understand.

12\. But if they violate their oaths  
After their covenant,  
And taunt you for your Faith,—  
Fight ye the chiefs of Unfaith:  
For their oaths are nothing to them:  
That thus they may be restrained.

13\. Will ye not fight people  
Who violated their oaths,

<span id="page_442">p. 442</span>

Plotted to expel the Apostle,  
And took the aggressive  
By being the first (to assault) you?  
Do ye fear them? Nay,  
It is God Whom ye should  
More justly fear, if ye believe!

14\. Fight them, and God will  
Punish them by your hands,  
Cover them with shame,  
Help you (to victory) over them,  
Heal the breasts of Believers,

15\. And still the indignation of their hearts!  
For God will turn (in mercy)  
To whom He will; and God  
Is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

16\. Or think ye that ye  
Shall be abandoned,  
As though God did not know'  
Those among you who strive  
With might and main, and take  
None for friends and protectors  
Except God, His Apostle,  
And the (community of) Believers?  
But God is well-acquainted  
With (all) that ye do.

<span id="page_443">p. 443</span>

##### SECTION 3.

17\. It is not for such  
As join gods with God,  
To visit or maintain  
The mosques of God  
While they witness  
Against their own souls  
To infidelity. The works  
Of such bear no fruit:  
In Fire shall they dwell.

18\. The mosques of God  
Shall be visited and maintained  
By such as believe in God  
And the Last Day, establish  
Regular prayers, and practise  
Regular charity, and fear  
None (at all) except God.  
It is they who are expected  
To be on true guidance!

19\. Do ye make the giving  
Of drink to pilgrims,

<span id="page_444">p. 444</span>

Or the maintenance of  
The Sacred Mosque, equal  
To (the pious service of) those  
Who believe in God  
And the Last Day, and strive  
With might and main  
In the cause of God?  
They are not comparable  
In the sight of God:  
And God guides not  
Those who do wrong.

20\. Those who believe, and suffer  
Exile and strive with might  
And main, in God's cause,  
With their goods and their persons,  
Have the highest rank  
In the sight of God:  
They are the people  
Who will achieve (salvation).

21\. Their Lord doth give them  
Glad tidings of a Mercy  
From Himself, of His good pleasure,  
And of Gardens for them,  
Wherein are delights  
That endure:

22\. They will dwell therein  
For ever. Verily in God's presence  
Is a reward, the greatest (of all).

23\. O ye who believe! Take not  
For protectors your fathers  
And your brothers if they love  
Infidelity above Faith:

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span>

If any of you do so,  
They do wrong.

24\. Say; If it be that your fathers,  
Your sons, your brothers,  
Your mates, or your kindred;  
The wealth that ye have gained;  
The commerce in which ye fear  
A decline: or the dwellings  
In which ye delight—  
Are dearer to you than God,  
Or His Apostle, or the striving  
In His cause;—then wait  
Until God brings about  
His Decision: and God  
Guides not the rebellious.

##### SECTION 4.

25\. Assuredly God did help you  
In many battle-fields  
And on the day of Ḥunain:  
Behold! your great numbers  
Elated you, but they availed  
You naught: the land,  
For all that it is wide,  
Did. constrain you, and ye

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

Turned back in retreat.

26\. But God did pour His calm  
On the Apostle and on the Believers,  
And sent down forces which ye  
Saw not: He punished  
The Unbelievers: thus doth He  
Reward those without Faith.

27\. Again will God, after this,  
Turn (in mercy) to whom  
He will: for God  
Is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

28\. O ye who believe! Truly  
The Pagans are unclean;  
So let them not,  
After this year of theirs,

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

Approach the Sacred Mosque.  
And if ye fear poverty,  
Soon will God enrich you,  
If He wills, out of His bounty,  
For God is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

29\. Fight those who believe not  
In God nor the Last Day,  
Nor hold that forbidden  
Which hath been forbidden  
By God and His Apostle,  
Nor acknowledge the Religion  
Of Truth, (even if they are)  
Of the People of the Book,  
Until they pay the *Jizya*  
With willing submission,  
And feel themselves subdued.

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span>

##### SECTION 5.

30\. The Jews call ’Uzair a son  
Of God, and the Christians  
Call Christ the Son of God.  
That is a saying from their mouth;  
(In this) they but imitate  
What the Unbelievers of old  
Used to say. God's curse  
Be on them: how they are deluded  
Away from the Truth!

31\. They take their priests  
And their anchorites to be  
Their lords in derogation of God,  
And (they take as their Lord)  
Christ the son of Mary;  
Yet they were commanded  
To worship but One God:  
There is no god but He.  
Praise and glory to Him  
(Far is He) from having  
The partners they associate  
(With Him).

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

32\. Fain would they extinguish  
God's Light with their mouths,  
But God will not allow  
But that His Light should be  
Perfected, even though the Unbelievers  
May detest (it).

33\. It is He Who hath sent  
His Apostle with Guidance  
And the Religion of Truth,  
To proclaim it  
Over all religion,  
Even though the Pagans  
May detest (it).

34\. O ye who believe! There are  
Indeed many among the priests  
And anchorites, who in falsehood  
Devour the substance of men  
And hinder (them) from the Way  
Of God. And there are those  
Who bury gold and silver  
And spend it not in the Way.  
Of God: announce unto them  
A most grievous penalty—

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

35\. On the Day when heat  
Will be produced out of  
That (wealth) in the fire  
Of Hell, and with it will be  
Branded their foreheads,  
Their flanks, and their backs.  
—"This is the (treasure) which ye  
Buried for yourselves: taste ye,  
Then, the (treasures) ye buried!"

36\. The number of months  
In the sight of God  
Is twelve (in a year)  
So ordained by Him  
The day He created  
The heavens and the earth;  
Of them four are sacred:  
That is the straight usage.  
So wrong not yourselves  
Therein, and fight the Pagans

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

All together as they  
Fight you all together.  
But know that God  
Is with those who restrain  
Themselves.

37\. Verily the transposing  
(Of a prohibited month)  
Is an addition to Unbelief:  
The Unbelievers are led  
To wrong thereby: for they make  
It lawful one year,  
And forbidden another year,  
In order to adjust the number  
Of months forbidden by God  
And make such forbidden ones  
Lawful. The evil of their course  
Seems pleasing to them.  
But God guideth not  
Those who reject Faith.

##### SECTION 6.

38\. O ye who believe! what  
Is the matter with you,  
That, when ye are asked  
To go forth in the Cause of God,  
Ye cling heavily to the earth?  
Do ye prefer the life  
Of this world to the Hereafter?  
But little is the comfort  
Of this life, as compared  
With the Hereafter.

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

39\. Unless ye go forth,  
He will punish you  
With a grievous penalty,  
And put others in your place;  
But Him ye would not harm  
In the least. For God  
Hath power over all things.

40\. If ye help not (your Leader),  
(it is no matter): for God  
Did indeed help him,  
When the Unbelievers  
Drove him out: he had  
No more than one companion:  
They two were in the Cave,  
And he said to his companion,  
"Have no fear, for God  
Is with us": then God  
Sent down His peace upon him,  
And strengthened him with forces  
Which ye saw not, and humbled  
To the depths the word  
Of the Unbelievers.  
But the word of God  
Is exalted to the heights:  
For God is Exalted in might, Wise

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

41\. Go ye forth, (whether equipped)  
Lightly or heavily, and strive  
And struggle, with your goods  
And your persons, in the Cause  
Of God. That is best  
For you, if ye (but) knew.

42\. If there had been  
Immediate gain (in sight),  
And the journey easy,  
They would (all) without doubt  
Have followed thee, but  
The distance was long,  
(And weighed) on them.  
They would indeed swear  
By God, "If we only could,  
We should certainly  
Have come out with you:"  
They would destroy their own souls;  
For God doth know  
That they are certainly lying.

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

##### SECTION 7.

43\. God give thee grace! Why  
Didst thou grant them exemption  
Until those who told the truth  
Were seen by thee in a clear light,  
And thou hadst proved the liars?

44\. Those who believe in God  
And the Last Day ask thee  
For no exemption from fighting  
With their goods and persons.  
And God knoweth well  
Those who do their duty.

45\. Only those ask thee for exemption  
Who believe not in God  
And the Last Day, and  
Whose hearts are in doubt,  
So that they are tossed  
In their doubts to and fro.

46\. If they had intended  
To come out, they would  
Certainly have made  
Some preparation therefor;  
But God was averse  
To their being sent forth;  
So He made them lag behind,  
And they were told,  
"Sit ye among those  
Who sit (inactive)."

47\. If they had come out  
With you, they would not

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

Have added to your (strength)  
But only (made for) disorder,  
Hurrying to and fro in your midst  
And sowing sedition among you,  
And there would have been  
Some among you  
Who would have listened to them.  
But God knoweth well  
Those who do wrong.

48\. Indeed they had plotted  
Sedition before, and upset  
Matters for thee,—until  
The Truth arrived, and the Decree  
Of God became manifest,  
Much to their disgust.

49\. Among them is (many) a man  
Who says: "Grant me exemption  
And draw me not.  
Into trial." Have they not  
Fallen into trial already?  
And indeed Hell surrounds  
The Unbelievers (on all sides).

50\. If good befalls thee,  
It grieves them; but if  
A misfortune befalls thee,  
They say, "We took indeed  
Our precautions beforehand,"  
And they turn away rejoicing.

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

51\. Say: "Nothing will happen to us  
Except what God has decreed  
For us: He is our Protector":  
And on God let the Believers  
Put their trust.

52\. Say: "Can you expect for us  
(Any fate) other than one  
Of two glorious things—  
(Martyrdom or victory)?  
But we can expect for you  
Either that God will send  
His punishment from Himself,  
Or by our hands. So wait  
(Expectant); we too  
Will wait with you."

53\. Say: "Spend (for the Cause)  
Willingly or unwillingly:  
Not from you will it be  
Accepted: for ye are indeed  
A people rebellious and wicked."

54\. The only reasons why  
Their contributions are not  
Accepted are: that they reject  
God and His Apostle;  
That they come to prayer  
Without earnestness; and that  
They offer contributions unwillingly.

55\. Let not their wealth rats  
Nor their (following in) sons

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

Dazzle thee: in reality  
God's Plan is to punish them  
With these things in this life,  
And that their souls may perish  
In their (very) denial of God.

56\. They swear by God  
That they are indeed  
Of you; but they are not  
Of you: yet they are afraid  
(To appear in their true colours).

57\. If they could find  
A place to flee to,  
Or caves, or a place  
Of concealment, they would  
Turn straightway thereto,  
With an obstinate rush.

58\. And among them are men  
Who slander thee in the matter  
Of (the distribution of) the alms:  
If they are given part thereof,  
They are pleased, but if not,  
Behold! they are indignant!

59\. If only they had been content  
With what God and His Apostle  
Gave them, and had said,  
"Sufficient unto us is God!  
God and His Apostle will soon  
Give us of His bounty:  
To God do we turn our hopes!"  
(That would have been the right course).

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

##### SECTION 8.

60\. Alms are for the poor  
And the needy, and those  
Employed to administer the (funds);  
For those whose hearts  
Have been (recently) reconciled  
(To Truth); for those in bondage  
And in debt; in the cause  
Of God; and for the wayfarer:  
(Thus is it) ordained by God,  
And God is full of knowledge  
And wisdom.

61\. Among them are men  
Who molest the Prophet  
And say, "He is (all) ear."  
Say, "He listens to what is  
Best for you: he believes  
In God, has faith  
In the Believers, and is a Mercy  
To those of you who believe."  
But those who molest the Apostle  
Will have a grievous penalty.

62\. To you they swear by God.  
In order to please you:  
But it is more fitting  
That they should please  
God and His Apostle,  
If they are Believers.

<span id="page_459">p. 459</span>

63\. Know they not that for those  
Who oppose God and His Apostle,  
Is the Fire of Hell?—  
Wherein they shall dwell.  
That is the supreme disgrace.

64\. The Hypocrites are afraid  
Lest a Sūra should be sent down  
About them, showing them what  
Is (really passing) in their hearts.  
Say: "Mock ye! But verily  
God will bring to light all  
That ye fear (should be revealed).

65\. If thou dost question them,  
They declare (with emphasis):  
"We were only talking idly  
And in play." Say: "Was it  
At God, and His Signs,  
And His Apostle, that ye  
Were mocking?"

66\. Make ye no excuses:  
Ye have rejected Faith  
After ye had accepted it.  
If We pardon some of you,  
We will punish others amongst you,  
For that they are in sin.

##### SECTION 9.

67\. The Hypocrites, men and women,  
(Have an understanding) with each other:

<span id="page_460">p. 460</span>

They enjoin evil, and forbid  
What is just, and are close  
With their hands. They have  
Forgotten God; so He  
Hath forgotten them. Verily  
The Hypocrites are rebellious  
And perverse.

68\. God hath promised the Hypocrites  
Men and women, and the rejecters,  
Of Faith, the fire of Hell:  
Therein shall they dwell:  
Sufficient is it for them:  
For them is the curse of God,  
And an enduring punishment,—

69\. As in the case of those  
Before you: they were  
Mightier than you in power,  
And more flourishing in wealth  
And children. They had  
Their enjoyment of their portion:  
And ye have of yours, as did  
Those before you; and ye  
Indulge in idle talk  
As they did. They!—  
Their works are fruitless  
In this world and in the Hereafter,  
And they will lose  
(All spiritual good).

70\. Hath not the story reached them  
Of those before them?—  
The people of Noah, and ’Ād,  
And <u>Th</u>amūd; the people

<span id="page_461">p. 461</span>

Of Abraham, the men  
Of Midian, and the Cities overthrown.  
To them came their apostles  
With Clear Signs. It is  
Not God Who wrongs them,  
But they wrong their own souls.

71\. The Believers, men  
And women, are protectors,  
One of another: they enjoin  
What is just, and forbid  
What is evil: they observe  
Regular prayers, practise  
Regular charity, and obey  
God and His Apostle.  
On them will God pour  
His mercy: for God  
Is Exalted in power, Wise:

72\. God hath promised to Believers,  
Men and women, Gardens  
Under which rivers flow,  
To dwell therein,  
And beautiful mansions  
In Gardens of everlasting bliss.  
But the greatest bliss  
Is the Good Pleasure of God:  
That is the supreme felicity.

<span id="page_462">p. 462</span>

##### SECTION 10.

73\. O Prophet! strive hard against  
The Unbelievers and the Hypocrites,  
And be firm against them.  
Their abode is Hell,—  
An evil refuge indeed.

74\. They swear by God that they  
Said nothing (evil), but indeed  
They uttered blasphemy,  
And they did it after accepting  
Islam; and they meditated  
A plot which they were unable  
To carry out: this revenge  
Of theirs was (their) only return  
For the bounty with which  
God and His Apostle had enriched  
Them! If they repent,  
It will be best for them;  
But if they turn back  
(To their evil ways),  
God will punish them  
With a grievous penalty  
In this life and in the Hereafter:  
They shall have none on earth  
To protect or help them.

75\. Amongst them are men  
Who made a Covenant with God,  
That if He bestowed on them  
Of His bounty, they would give  
(Largely) in charity, and be truly  
Amongst those who are righteous.

<span id="page_463">p. 463</span>

76\. But when He did bestow  
Of His bounty, they became  
Covetous, and turned back  
(From their Covenant), averse  
(From its fulfilment).

77\. So He hath put as a consequence  
Hypocrisy into their hearts,  
(To last) till the Day whereon  
They shall meet Him: because  
They broke their Covenant  
With God, and because they  
Lied (again and again).

78\. Know they not that God  
Doth know their secret (thoughts)  
And their secret counsels,  
And that God knoweth well  
All things unseen?

79\. Those who slander such  
Of the Believers as give themselves  
Freely to (deeds of) charity,  
As well as such as can find  
Nothing to give except  
The fruits of their labour,—  
And throw ridicule on them,—  
God will throw back

<span id="page_464">p. 464</span>

Their ridicule on them:  
And they shall have  
A grievous penalty.

80\. Whether thou ask  
For their forgiveness,  
Or not, (their sin is unforgivable):  
If thou ask seventy times  
For their forgiveness, God  
Will not forgive them:  
Because they have rejected  
God and His Apostle: and God  
Guideth not those  
Who are perversely rebellious.

##### SECTION 11.

81\. Those who were left behind  
(In the Tabūk expedition)  
Rejoiced in their inaction  
Behind the back of the Apostle  
Of God: they hated to strive  
And fight, with their goods  
And their persons, in the Cause  
Of God: they said,  
"Go not forth in the heat."  
Say, "The fire of Hell  
Is fiercer in heat." If  
Only they could understand!

82\. Let them laugh a little:  
Much will they weep:

<span id="page_465">p. 465</span>

A recompense for the (evil)  
That they do.

83\. If, then, God bring thee back  
To any of them, and they ask  
Thy permission to come out  
(With thee), say: "Never shall ye  
Come out with me, nor fight  
An enemy with me:  
For ye preferred to sit  
Inactive on the first occasion:  
Then sit ye (now)  
With those who lag behind."

84\. Nor do thou ever pray  
For any of them that dies,  
Nor stand at his grave;  
For they rejected God  
And His Apostle, and died  
In a state of perverse rebellion.

85\. Nor let their wealth  
Nor their (following in) sons  
Dazzle thee: God's Plan  
Is to punish them  
With these things in this world,  
And that their souls may perish  
In their (very) denial of God.

<span id="page_466">p. 466</span>

86\. When a Sūra comes down,  
Enjoining them to believe  
In God and to strive and fight  
Along with His Apostle,  
Those with wealth and influence  
Among them ask thee  
For exemption, and say:  
"Leave us (behind): we  
Would be with those  
Who sit (at home)."

87\. They prefer to be with (the women),  
Who remain behind (at home):  
Their hearts are sealed  
And so they understand not.

88\. But the Apostle, and those  
Who believe with him,  
Strive and fight with their wealth  
And their persons: for them  
Are (all) good things:  
And it is they  
Who will prosper.

89\. God hath prepared for them  
Gardens under which rivers flow,

<span id="page_467">p. 467</span>

To dwell therein:  
That is the supreme felicity.

##### SECTION 12.

90\. And there were, among  
The desert Arabs (also),  
Men who made excuses  
And came to claim exemption;  
And those who were false  
To God and His Apostle  
(Merely) sat inactive.  
Soon will a grievous penalty  
Seize the Unbelievers  
Among them.

91\. There is no blame  
On those who are infirm,

<span id="page_468">p. 468</span>

Or ill, or who find  
No resources to spend  
(On the Cause), if they  
Are sincere (in duty) to God  
And His Apostle:  
No ground (of complaint)  
Can there be against such  
As do right: and God  
Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

92\. Nor (is there blame)  
On those who came to thee  
To be provided with mounts,  
And when thou saidst,  
"I can find no mounts  
For you, "they turned back,  
Their eyes streaming with tears  
Of grief that they had  
No resources wherewith  
To provide the expenses.

93\. The ground (of complaint)  
Is against such as claim  
Exemption while they are rich.  
They prefer to stay  
With the (women) who remain  
Behind: God hath sealed  
Their hearts; so they know not  
(What they miss).

<span id="page_469">p. 469</span>

94\. They will present their excuses  
To you when ye return  
To them. Say thou: "Present  
No excuses: we shall not  
Believe you: God hath already  
Informed us of the true state  
Of matters concerning you:  
It is your actions that God  
And His Apostle will observe:  
In the end will ye  
Be brought back to Him  
Who knoweth what is hidden  
And what is open:  
Then will He show you  
The truth of all  
That ye did."

95\. They will swear to you by God,  
When ye return to them,  
That ye may leave them alone.  
So leave them alone:  
For they are an abomination,  
And Hell is their dwelling-place,—  
A fitting recompense  
For the (evil) that they did.

96\. They will swear unto you,  
That ye may be pleased with them,  
But if ye are pleased with them,  
God is not pleased  
With those who disobey.

97\. The Arabs of the desert  
Are the worst in unbelief  
And hypocrisy, and most fitted  
To be in ignorance  
Of the command which God  
Hath sent down to His Apostle:  
But God is All-Knowing,  
All-Wise.

98\. Some of the desert Arabs  
Look upon their payments

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

As a fine, and watch  
For disasters for you: on them  
Be the disaster of Evil:  
For God is He that heareth  
And knoweth (all things).

99\. But some of the desert Arabs  
Believe in God and the Last Day,  
And look on their payments  
As pious gifts bringing them  
Nearer to God and obtaining  
The prayers of the Apostle.  
Aye, indeed they bring them  
Nearer (to Him): soon will God  
Admit them to His Mercy:  
For God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 13.

100\. The vanguard (of Islam)—  
The first of those who forsook  
(Their homes) and of those  
Who gave them aid, and (also)  
Those who follow them  
In (all) good deeds,—  
Well-pleased is God with them,  
As are they with Him:

<span id="page_471">p. 471</span>

For them hath He prepared  
Gardens under which rivers flow,  
To dwell therein for ever:  
That is the supreme Felicity.

101\. Certain of the desert Arabs  
Round about you are Hypocrites,  
As well as (desert Arabs) among  
The Medina folk: they are  
Obstinate in hypocrisy: thou  
Knowest them not: We know them:  
Twice shall We punish them:  
And in addition shall they be  
Sent to a grievous Penalty.

102\. Others (there are who) have  
Acknowledged their wrong-doings:  
They have mixed an act  
That was good with another  
That was evil. Perhaps God  
Will turn unto them (in mercy):  
For God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

103\. Of their goods take alms,  
That so thou mightest  
Purify and sanctify them;  
And pray on their behalf.  
Verily thy prayers are a source  
Of security for them:  
And God is One  
Who heareth and knoweth.

<span id="page_472">p. 472</span>

104\. Know they not that God  
Doth accept repentance from  
His votaries and receives  
Their gifts of charity, and that  
God is verily He,  
The Oft-Returning, Most Merciful?

105\. And say: "Work (righteousness):  
Soon will God observe your work,  
And His Apostle, and the Believers:  
Soon will ye be brought back  
To the Knower of what is  
Hidden and what is open:  
Then will He show you  
The truth of all that ye did."

106\. There are (yet) others,  
Held in suspense for the command  
Of God, whether He will  
Punish them, or turn in mercy  
To them: and God  
Is All-Knowing, Wise.

107\. And there are those  
Who put up a mosque

<span id="page_473">p. 473</span>

By way of mischief and infidelity—  
To disunite the Believers  
And in preparation for one  
Who warred against God  
And His Apostle aforetime.  
They will indeed swear  
That their intention is nothing  
But good; but God doth declare  
That they are certainly liars.

108\. Never stand thou forth therein.  
There is a mosque whose foundation  
Was laid from the first day  
On piety; it is more worthy  
Of thy standing forth (for prayer)  
Therein. In it are men who  
Love to be purified; and God  
Loveth those who make themselves pure.

109\. Which then is best?—he that  
Layeth his foundation  
On piety to God  
And His Good Pleasure?—or he  
That layeth his foundation  
On an undermined sand-cliff  
Ready to crumble to pieces?  
And it doth crumble to pieces  
With him, into the fire  
Of Hell. And God guideth not  
People that do wrong.

110\. The foundation of those  
Who so build is never free

<span id="page_474">p. 474</span>

From suspicion and shakiness  
In their hearts, until  
Their hearts are cut to pieces.  
And God is All-Knowing, Wise.

##### SECTION 14.

111\. God hath purchased of the Believers  
Their persons and their goods;  
For theirs (in return)  
Is the Garden (of Paradise):  
They fight in His Cause,  
And slay and are slain:  
A promise binding on Him  
In Truth, through the Law,  
The Gospel, and the Qur-ān:  
And who is more faithful  
To his Covenant than God?  
Then rejoice in the bargain  
Which ye have concluded:  
That is the achievement supreme.

<span id="page_475">p. 475</span>

112\. Those that turn (to God)  
In repentance; that serve Him,  
And praise Him; that wander  
In devotion to the Cause of God;  
That bow down and prostrate themselves  
In prayer; that enjoin good  
And forbid evil; and observe  
The limits set by God;—  
(These do rejoice). So proclaim  
The glad tidings to the Believers.

113\. It is not fitting,  
For the Prophet and those  
Who believe, that they should  
Pray for forgiveness  
For Pagans, even though  
They be of kin, after it is  
Clear to them that they  
Are companions of the Fire.

114\. And Abraham prayed  
For his father's forgiveness  
Only because of a promise  
He had made to him.  
But when it became clear  
To him that he was  
An enemy to God, he  
Dissociated himself from him:  
For Abraham was most  
Tender-hearted, forbearing.

115\. And God will not mislead  
A people after He hath

<span id="page_476">p. 476</span>

Guided them, in order that  
He may make clear to them  
What to fear (and avoid)—  
For God hath knowledge  
Of all things.

116\. Unto God belongeth  
The dominion of the heavens  
And the earth. He giveth life  
And He taketh it. Except for Him  
Ye have no protector  
Nor helper.

117\. God turned with favour  
To the Prophet, the Muhājirs,  
And the Anṣār,—who followed  
Him in a time of distress,  
After that the hearts of a part  
Of them had nearly swerved  
(From duty); but He turned  
To them (also): for He is  
Unto them Most Kind,  
Most Merciful.

118\. (He turned in mercy also)  
To the three who were left  
Behind; (they felt guilty)  
To such a degree that the earth

<span id="page_477">p. 477</span>

Seemed constrained to them,  
For all its speciousness,  
And their (very) Souls seemed  
Straitened to them,  
And they perceived that  
There is no fleeing from God  
(And no refuge) but to Himself.  
Then He turned to them,  
That they might repent:  
For God is Oft-Returning,  
Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 15.

119\. O ye who believe! Fear God  
And be with those  
Who are true (in word and deed).

120\. It was not fitting  
For the people of Medina  
And the Bedouin Arabs  
Of the neighbourhood, to refuse  
To follow God's Apostle,  
Nor to prefer their own lives  
To his: because nothing  
Could they suffer or do,  
But was reckoned to their credit  
As a deed of righteousness,—  
Whether they suffered thirst,  
Or fatigue, or hunger, in the Cause  
Of God, or trod paths  
To raise the ire of the Unbelievers,  
Or received any injury

<span id="page_478">p. 478</span>

Whatever from an enemy:  
For God suffereth not  
The reward to be lost  
Of those who do good;—

121, Nor could they spend anything  
(For the Cause)—small or great—  
Nor cut across a valley,  
But the deed is inscribed  
To their credit; that God  
May requite their deed  
With the best (possible reward).

122\. Nor should the Believers  
All go forth together:  
If a contingent  
From every expedition  
Remained behind,  
They could devote themselves  
To studies in religion,  
And admonish the people  
When they return to them,—  
That thus they (may learn)  
To guard themselves (against evil)

##### SECTION 16.

123\. O ye who believe! Fight  
The Unbelievers who gird you about,  
And let them find firmness  
In you: and know that God  
Is with those who fear Him.

<span id="page_479">p. 479</span>

124\. Whenever there cometh down'  
A Sūra, some of them say:  
"Which of you has had  
His faith increased by it?"  
Yea, those who believe,—  
Their faith is increased,  
And they do rejoice.

125\. But those in whose hearts  
Is a disease,—it will add doubt  
To their doubt, and they will die  
In a state of Unbelief.

126\. See they not that they  
Are tried every year  
Once or twice? Yet they  
Turn not in repentance,  
And they take no heed.

127\. Whenever there cometh down  
A Sūra, they look at each other,  
(Saying), "Doth anyone see you?"  
Then they turn aside:  
God hath turned their hearts  
(From the light); for they  
Are a people that understand not.

128\. Now hath come unto you  
An Apostle from amongst

<span id="page_480">p. 480</span>

Yourselves: it grieves him  
That ye should perish:  
Ardently anxious is he  
Over you: to the Believers  
Is he most kind and merciful.

129\. But if they turn away,  
Say: "God sufficeth me:  
There is no god but He:  
On Him is my trust,  
He the Lord of the Throne  
(Of Glory) Supreme!
