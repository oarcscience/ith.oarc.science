### Sūra X.

### Yūnus, or Jonah.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*

1\. A. L. R.  
These are the Āyats  
Of the Book of Wisdom.

2\. Is it a matter  
Of wonderment to men  
That We have sent  
Our inspiration to a man  
From among themselves?—  
That he should warn mankind  
(Of their danger), and give  
The good news to the Believers  
That they have before their Lord  
The lofty rank of Truth.  
(But) say the Unbelievers:  
"This is indeed  
An evident sorcerer!"

3\. Verily your Lord is God,  
Who created the heavens  
And the earth in six Days,

<span id="page_484">p. 484</span>

And is firmly established  
On the Throne (of authority),  
Regulating and governing all things.  
No intercessor (can plead with Him)  
Except after His leave  
(Hath been obtained). This  
Is God your Lord; Him therefore  
Serve ye: will ye not  
Receive admonition?

4\. To Him will be your return—  
Of all of you. The promise  
Of God is true and sure.  
It is He who beginneth  
The process of creation,  
And repeateth it, that He  
May reward with justice  
Those who believe  
And work righteousness;  
But those who reject Him  
Will have draughts  
Of boiling fluids,  
And a Penalty grievous,  
Because they did reject Him.

5\. It is He who made the sun  
To be a shining glory

<span id="page_485">p. 485</span>

And the moon to be a light  
(Of beauty), and measured out  
Stages for her; that ye might  
Know the number of years  
And the count (of time).  
Nowise did God create this  
But in truth and righteousness.  
(Thus) doth He explain His Signs  
In detail, for those who understand.

6\. Verily, in the alternation  
Of the Night and the Day,  
And in all that God  
Hath created, in the heavens  
And the earth, are Signs  
For those who fear Him.

7\. Those who rest not their hope  
On their meeting with Us,  
But are pleased and satisfied  
With the life of the Present,  
And those who heed not  
Our Signs,—

8\. Their abode is the Fire,  
Because of the (evil)  
They earned.

9\. Those who believe,  
And work righteousness,—  
Their Lord will guide them  
Because of their Faith:

<span id="page_486">p. 486</span>

Beneath them will flow  
Rivers in Gardens of Bliss.

10\. (This will be) their cry therein:  
"Glory to Thee, O God!"  
And "Peace" will be their greeting therein!  
And the close of their cry  
Will be: "Praise be to God,  
The Cherisher and Sustainer.  
Of the Worlds!"

##### SECTION 2.

11\. If God were to hasten for men  
The ill (they have earned)  
As they would fain hasten on  
The good,—then would  
Their respite be settled at once.  
But We leave those  
Who rest not their hope  
On their meeting with Us,  
In their trespasses, wandering  
In distraction to and fro.

12\. When trouble toucheth a man,  
He crieth unto Us  
(In all postures)—lying down  
On his side, or sitting,  
Or standing. But when We  
Have solved his trouble,  
He passeth on his way as if  
He had never cried to Us  
For a trouble that touched him!  
Thus do the deeds of transgressors  
Seem fair in their eyes!

<span id="page_487">p. 487</span>

13\. Generations before you  
We destroyed when they  
Did wrong: their Apostles  
Came to them with Clear Signs,  
But they would not believe!  
Thus do We requite  
Those who sin!

14\. Then We made you heirs  
In the land after them,  
To see how ye would behave!

15\. But when Our Clear Signs  
Are rehearsed unto them,  
Those who rest not their hope  
On their meeting with Us,  
Say: "Bring us a Reading  
Other than this, or change this,"  
Say: "It is not for me,  
Of my own accord,  
To change it: I follow  
Naught but what is revealed  
Unto me: if I were  
To disobey my Lord,  
I should myself fear the Penalty  
Of a Great Day (to come)."

16\. Say: "If God had so willed,  
I should not have rehearsed it  
To you, nor whould He  
Have made it known to you.  
A whole life-time before this  
Have I tarried amongst you:  
Will ye not then understand?

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

17\. Who doth more wrong  
Than such as forge a lie  
Against God, or deny  
His Signs? But never  
Will prosper those who sin.

18\. They serve, besides God,  
Things that hurt them not  
Nor profit them, and they say:  
"These are our intercessors  
With God." Say: "Do ye  
Indeed inform God of something  
He knows not, in the heavens  
Or on earth?—Glory to Him!  
And far is He above the partners  
They ascribe (to Him)!"

19\. Mankind was but one nation,  
But differed (later). Had it not  
Been for a Word  
That went forth before  
From thy Lord, their differences  
Would have been settled  
Between them.

20\. They say: "Why is not  
A Sign sent down to him  
From his Lord?" Say:  
"The Unseen is only  
For God (to know).  
Then wait ye: I too

<span id="page_489">p. 489</span>

Will wait with you.

##### SECTION 3.

21\. When We make mankind  
Taste of some mercy after  
Adversity hath touched them,  
Behold! they take to plotting  
Against Our Signs! Say:  
"Swifter to plan is God!"  
Verily, Our messengers record  
All the plots that ye make!

22\. He it is who enableth you  
To traverse through land  
And sea; so that ye even board  
Ships;—they sail with them  
With a favourable wind,  
And they rejoice thereat;  
Then comes a stormy wind  
And the waves come to them  
From all sides, and they think  
They are being overwhelmed:  
They cry unto God, sincerely  
Offering (their) duty unto Him,  
Saying, "If Thou dost deliver us  
From this, we shall truly

<span id="page_490">p. 490</span>

Show our gratitude!"

23\. But when he delivereth them,  
Behold! they transgress  
Insolently through the earth  
In defiance of right!  
O mankind! your insolence  
Is against your own souls,—  
An enjoyment of the life  
Of the Present: in the end,  
To Us is your return,  
And We shall show you  
The truth of all that ye did.

24\. The likeness of the life  
Of the Present is  
As the rain which We  
Send down from the skies:  
By its mingling arises  
The produce of the earth—  
Which provides food  
For men and animals:  
(It grows) till the earth  
Is clad with its golden  
Ornaments and is decked out  
(In beauty): the people to whom  
It belongs think they have  
All powers of disposal over it:  
There reaches it Our command  
By night or by day,  
And We make it  
Like a harvest clean-mown,  
As if it had not flourished

<span id="page_491">p. 491</span>

Only the day before!  
Thus do We explain  
The Signs in detail  
For those who reflect.

25\. But God doth call  
To the Home of Peace:  
He doth guide whom He pleaseth  
To a Way that is straight.

26\. To those who do right  
Is a goodly (reward)—  
Yea, more (than in measure)!  
No darkness nor shame  
Shall cover their faces!  
They are Companions of the Garden;  
They will abide therein  
(For aye)!

27\. But those who have earned  
Evil will have a reward  
Of like evil: ignominy  
Will cover their (faces):  
No defender will they have  
From (the wrath of) God:  
Their faces will be covered,  
As it were, with pieces  
From the depth of the darkness  
Of Night: they are Companions

<span id="page_492">p. 492</span>

Of the Fire: they will  
Abide therein (for aye)!

28\. One Day shall We gather them  
All together. Then shall We say  
To those who joined gods (with Us):  
"To your place! ye and those  
Ye joined as "partners"."  
We shall separate them,  
And their "partners" shall say:  
"It was not us  
That ye worshipped!

29\. "Enough is God for a witness  
Between us and you: we  
Certainly knew nothing  
Of your worship of us!"

30\. There will every soul prove  
(The fruits of) the deeds  
It sent before : they will  
Be brought back to God  
Their rightful Lord,  
And their invented falsehoods  
Will leave them in the lurch.

##### SECTION 4.

31\. Say: "Who is it that  
Sustains you (in life)  
From the sky and from the earth?

<span id="page_493">p. 493</span>

Or who is it that  
Has power over hearing  
And sight? And who  
Is it that brings out  
The living from the dead  
And the dead from the living?  
And who is it that  
Rules and regulates all affairs?"  
They will soon say, "God".  
Say, "Will ye not then  
Show piety (to Him)?"

32\. Such is God, your real  
Cherisher and Sustainer:  
Apart from Truth,  
What (remains) but error?  
How then are ye turned away?

33\. Thus is the Word  
Of thy Lord proved true  
Against those who rebel:  
Verily they will not believe.

34\. Say: "Of your 'partners',  
Can any originate creation  
And repeat it?" Say:  
"It is God Who originates  
Creation and repeats it:  
Then how are ye deluded  
Away (from the truth)?"

<span id="page_494">p. 494</span>

35\. Say: "Of your "partners"  
Is there any that  
Can give any guidance  
Towards Truth?" Say: "It is God  
Who gives guidance  
Towards Truth. Is then He  
Who gives guidance to Truth  
More worthy to be followed,  
Or he who finds not guidance  
(Himself) unless he is guided?  
What then is the matter  
With you? How judge ye?"

36\. But most of them follow  
Nothing but fancy: truly  
Fancy can be of no avail  
Against Truth. Verily God  
Is well aware of all  
That they do.

37\. This Qur-ān is not such  
As can be produced  
By other than God;  
On the contrary it is  
A confirmation of (revelations)  
That went before it,  
And a fuller explanation  
Of the Book—wherein  
There is no doubt  
From the Lord of the Worlds.

38\. Or do they say,  
"He forged it"?  
Say: "Bring then  
A Sūra like unto it,  
And call (to your aid)  
Anyone you can,  
Besides God, if it be  
Ye speak the truth!"

<span id="page_495">p. 495</span>

39\. Nay, they charge with falsehood  
That whose knowledge they  
Cannot compass, even before  
The elucidation thereof"  
Hath reached them: thus  
Did those before them  
Make charges of falsehood:  
But see what was the end  
Of those who did wrong!

40\. Of them there are some  
Who believe therein,  
And some who do not:  
And thy Lord knoweth best  
Those who are out for mischief.

##### SECTION 5.

41\. If they charge thee  
With falsehood, say:  
"My work to me,  
And yours to you!

<span id="page_496">p. 496</span>

Ye are free from responsibility  
For what I do, and I  
For what ye do!"

42\. Among them are some who  
(Pretend to) listen to thee:  
But canst thou make the deaf  
To hear,—even though  
They are without understanding?

43\. And among them are some  
Who look at thee:  
But canst thou guide  
The blind,—even though  
They will not see?

44\. Verily God will not deal  
Unjustly with man in aught:  
It is man that wrongs  
His own soul.

45\. One day He will  
Gather them together:  
(It will be) as if  
They had tarried  
But an hour of a day:  
They will recognise each other:  
Assuredly those will be lost  
Who denied the meeting  
With God and refused  
To receive true guidance.

46\. Whether We show thee  
(Realised in thy life-time)  
Some part of what We  
Promise them,—or We

<span id="page_497">p. 497</span>

Take thy soul (to Our Mercy)  
(Before that),—in any case,  
To Us is their return:  
Ultimately God is witness.  
To all that they do.

47\. To every people (was sent)  
An Apostle: when their Apostle  
Comes (before them), the matter  
Will be judged between them  
With justice, and they  
Will not be wronged.

48\. They say: "When  
Will this promise  
Come to pass,  
If ye speak the truth?"

49\. Say: "I have no power  
Over any harm or profit  
To myself except as God  
Willeth. To every People  
Is a term appointed:  
When their term is reached,  
Not an hour can they cause  
Delay, nor (an hour) can they  
Advance (it in anticipation)."

<span id="page_498">p. 498</span>

50\. Say: "Do ye see,  
If His punishment should come  
To you by night or by day,—  
What portion of it  
Would the Sinners  
Wish to hasten?

51\. "Would ye then believe in it  
At last, when it actually cometh  
To pass? (It will then be said:)  
'Ah! now? and ye wanted  
(Aforetime) to hasten it on!'

52\. "At length will be said  
To the wrong-doers: 'Taste ye  
The enduring punishment!  
Ye get but the recompense  
Of what ye earned!'"

53\. They seek to be informed  
By thee: "Is that true?"  
Say: "Aye! by my Lord!  
It is the very truth!  
And ye cannot frustrate it!"

##### SECTION 6.

54\. Every soul that hath sinned,  
If it possessed all  
That is on earth,  
Would fain give it in ransom:

<span id="page_499">p. 499</span>

They would declare (their) repentance  
When they see the Penalty:  
But the judgment between them  
Will be with justice,  
And no wrong will be done  
Unto them.

55\. Is it not (the case) that to God  
Belongeth whatever is  
In the heavens and on earth?  
Is it not (the case) that  
God's promise is assuredly true?  
Yet most of them understand not.

56\. It is He who giveth life  
And who taketh it,  
And to Him shall ye  
All be brought back.

57\. O mankind! there hath come  
To you a direction from your Lord  
And a healing for the (diseases)  
In your hearts,—and for those  
Who believe, a Guidance  
And a Mercy.

58\. Say: "In the Bounty of God.  
And in His Mercy,—in that  
Let them rejoice": that is better  
Than the (wealth) they hoard.

59\. Say: "See ye what things  
God hath sent down to you

<span id="page_500">p. 500</span>

For sustenance? Yet ye  
Hold forbidden some things  
Thereof and (some things) lawful."  
Say: "Hath God indeed  
Permitted you, or do ye invent  
(Things) to attribute to God?"

60\. And what think those  
Who invent lies against God,  
Of the Day of Judgment?  
Verily God is full of Bounty  
To mankind, but most  
Of them are ungrateful!"

##### SECTION 7.

61\. In whatever business thou  
Mayest be, and whatever portion  
Thou mayest be reciting  
From the Qur-ān,—and whatever  
Deed ye (mankind) may be doing,—  
We are Witnesses thereof  
When ye are deeply engrossed  
Therein. Nor is hidden  
From thy Lord (so much as)  
The weight of an atom  
On the earth or in heaven.  
And not the least  
And not the greatest  
Of these things but are recorded  
In a clear Record.

62\. Behold! verily on the friends  
Of God there is no fear,

<span id="page_501">p. 501</span>

Nor shall they grieve;

63\. Those who believe  
And (constantly) guard  
Against evil;—

64\. For them are Glad Tidings,  
In the life of the Present  
And in the Hereafter:  
No change can there be  
In the Words of God.  
This is indeed  
The supreme Felicity.

65\. Let not their speech  
Grieve thee: for all power  
And honour belong to God:  
It is He Who heareth  
And knoweth (all things).

66\. Behold! verily to God  
Belong all creatures,  
In the heavens and on earth.  
What do they follow  
Who worship as His "partners"  
Other than God? They follow  
Nothing but fancy, and  
They do nothing but lie.

67\. He it is that hath  
Made you the Night  
That ye may rest therein,  
And the Day to make  
Things visible (to you).  
Verily in this are Signs  
For those who listen  
(To His Message).

<span id="page_502">p. 502</span>

68\. They say, "God hath begotten  
A son!"—Glory be to Him!  
He is Self-Sufficient! His  
Are all things in the heavens  
And on earth! No warrant  
Have ye for this! Say ye  
About God what ye know not?

69\. Say: "Those who invent  
A lie against God  
Will never prosper."

70\. A little enjoyment  
In this world!—  
And then, to Us  
Will be their return.  
Then shall We make them  
Taste the severest Penalty  
For their blasphemies.

##### SECTION 8.

71\. Relate to them the story  
Of Noah. Behold! he said  
To his People: "O my People,  
If it be hard on your (mind)

<span id="page_503">p. 503</span>

That I should stay (with you)  
And commemorate the Signs  
Of God,—yet I put  
My trust in God.  
Get ye then an agreement  
About your plan and among  
Your Partners, so your plan  
Be not to you dark and dubious.  
Then pass your sentence on me,  
And give me no respite.

72\. "But if ye turn back, (consider):  
No reward have I asked  
Of you: my reward is only  
Due from God, and I  
Have been commanded to be  
Of those who submit  
To God's Will (in Islam)."

73\. They rejected him,  
But We delivered him,  
And those with him,  
In the Ark, and We made  
Them inherit (the earth),  
While We overwhelmed  
In the Flood those  
Who rejected Our Signs.  
Then see what was the end  
Of those who were warned  
(But heeded not)!

74\. Then after him We sent  
(Many) apostles to their Peoples:  
They brought them Clear Signs,  
But they would not believe  
What they had already rejected

<span id="page_504">p. 504</span>

Beforehand. Thus do We seal  
The hearts of the transgressors.

75\. Then after them sent We  
Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh  
And his chiefs with Our Signs.  
But they were arrogant:  
They were a people in sin.

76\. When the Truth did come  
To them from Us, they said:  
"This is indeed evident sorcery!"

77\. Said Moses: "Say ye (this)  
About the Truth when  
It hath (actually) reached you?  
Is sorcery (like) this?  
But sorcerers will not prosper."

78\. They said: "Hast thou  
Come to us to turn us  
Away from the ways  
We found our fathers following,—  
In order that thou and thy brother  
May have greatness in the land?  
But not we shall believe in you!"

79\. Said Pharaoh: "Bring me  
Every sorcerer well versed."

80\. When the sorcerers came,  
Moses said to them:  
"Throw ye what ye (wish)  
To throw!"

<span id="page_505">p. 505</span>

81\. When they had had their throw,  
Moses said: "What ye  
Have brought is sorcery:  
God will surely make it  
Of no effect: for God  
Prospereth not the work  
Of those who make mischief.

82\. "And God by His Words  
Doth prove and establish  
His Truth, however much  
The Sinners may hate it!"

##### SECTION 9.

83\. But none believed in Moses  
Except some children of his People,  
Because of the fear of Pharaoh  
And his chiefs, lest they  
Should persecute them; and certainly  
Pharaoh was mighty on the earth  
And one who transgressed all bounds.

84\. Moses said: "O my People!  
If ye do (really) believe  
In God, then in Him  
Put your trust if ye  
Submit (your will to His)."

85\. They said: "In God  
Do we put our trust.

<span id="page_506">p. 506</span>

Our Lord! make us not  
A trial for those  
Who practise oppression;

86."And deliver us by Thy Mercy  
From those who reject (Thee)."

87\. We inspired Moses and his brother  
With this Message: "Provide  
Dwellings for your People  
In Egypt, make your dwellings  
Into places of worship,  
And establish regular prayers:  
And give Glad Tidings  
To those who believe!"

88\. Moses prayed: "Our Lord!  
Thou hast indeed bestowed  
On Pharaoh and his Chiefs  
Splendour and wealth in the life  
Of the Present, and so,  
Our Lord, they mislead (men)  
From Thy Path. Deface.  
Our Lord, the features of their wealth,  
And send hardness to their hearts,  
So they will not believe

<span id="page_507">p. 507</span>

Until they see  
The grievous Penalty."

89\. God said: "Accepted is  
Your prayer (O Moses and Aaron)  
So stand ye straight,  
And follow not the path  
Of those who know not.

90\. We took the Children  
Of Israel across the sea:  
Pharaoh and his hosts followed them  
In insolence and spite.  
At length, when overwhelmed  
With the flood, he said:  
"I believe that there is no god  
Except Him Whom the Children  
Of Israel believe in:  
I am of those who submit  
(To God in Islām)."

91\. (It was said to him:)  
"Ah now!—But a little while  
Before, wast thou in rebellion!—  
And thou didst mischief (and violence)!

92\. "This day shall We save thee  
In thy body, that thou  
Mayest be a Sign to those  
Who come after thee!  
But verily, many among mankind  
Are heedless of Our Signs!"

<span id="page_508">p. 508</span>

##### SECTION 10.

93\. We settled the Children  
Of Israel in a beautiful  
Dwelling-place, and provided  
For them sustenance of the best:  
It was after knowledge had been  
Granted to them, that they  
Fell into schisms. Verily  
God will judge between them  
As to the schisms amongst them,  
On the Day of Judgment.

94\. If thou wert in doubt  
As to what We have revealed  
Unto thee, then ask those  
Who have been reading  
The Book from before thee:  
The Truth hath indeed come  
To thee from thy Lord:  
So be in no wise  
Of those in doubt.

95\. Nor be of those who reject  
The Signs of God,  
Or thou shalt be of those  
Who perish.

96\. Whose against whom the Word  
Of thy Lord hath been verified

<span id="page_509">p. 509</span>

Would not believe—

97\. Even if every Sign was brought  
Unto them,—until they see  
(For themselves) the Penalty Grievous.

98\. Why was there not  
A single township (among those  
We warned), which believed,—  
So its Faith should have  
Profited it,—except the People  
Of Jonah? When they believed,  
We removed from them  
The Penalty of Ignominy  
In the life of the Present,  
And permitted them to enjoy  
(Their life) for a while.

99\. If it had been thy Lord's Will,  
They would all have believed,—  
All who are on earth!  
Wilt thou then compel mankind,

Against their will, to believe!

100\. No soul can believe, except  
By the Will of God,  
And He will place Doubt  
(Or obscurity) on those  
Who will not understand.

101\. Say: "Behold all that is  
In the heavens and on earth ";  
But neither Signs nor Warners  
Profit those who believe not.

102\. Do they then expect  
(Any thing) but (what happened  
In) the days of the men  
Who passed away before them?  
Say: "Wait ye then:  
For I, too, will wait with you."

103\. In the end We deliver  
Our apostles and those who believe:  
Thus is it fitting on Our part  
That We should deliver  
Those who believe!

##### SECTION 11.

104\. Say: "O ye men!  
If ye are in doubt  
As to my religion, (behold!)  
I worship not what ye  
Worship, other than God!  
But I worship God  
Who will take your souls  
(At death): I am commanded  
To be (in the ranks)  
Of the Believers,

105\. "And further (thus), "set thy face  
Towards Religion with true piety,  
And never in any wise  
Be of the Unbelievers;

106\. "Nor call on any,  
Other than God;—  
Such will neither profit thee  
Nor hurt thee: if thou dost,  
Behold! thou shalt certainly  
Be of those who do wrong."

107\. If God do touch thee  
With hurt, there is none  
Can remove it but He:  
If He do design some benefit

For thee, there is none  
Can keep back His favour:  
He causeth it to reach  
Whomsoever of His servants  
He pleaseth. And He is  
The Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

108\. Say: "O ye men! Now  
Truth hath reached you  
From your Lord! Those who receive  
Guidance, do so for the good  
Of their own souls; those  
Who stray, do so to their own loss:  
And I am not (set) over you  
To arrange your affairs."

109\. Follow thou the inspiration  
Sent unto thee, and be  
Patient and constant, till God  
Do decide: for He  
Is the Best to decide.
