### Sūra XIII.

### *Ra’d*, or Thunder.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. A. L. M. R. These are  
The Signs (or Verses)  
Of the Book: that which  
Hath been revealed unto thee  
From thy Lord is the Truth;  
But most men believe not.

2\. God is He Who raised  
The heavens without any pillars  
That ye can see; is firmly  
Established on the Throne (of Authority);  
He has subjected the sun  
And the moon (to his Law)!  
Each one runs (its course)  
For a term appointed.  
He doth regulate all affairs,  
Explaining the Signs in detail,

<span id="page_603">p. 603</span>

That ye may believe with certainty  
In the meeting with your Lord.

3\. And it is He Who spread out  
The earth, and set thereon  
Mountains standing firm,  
And (flowing) rivers: and fruit  
Of every kind He made  
In pairs, two and two:  
He draweth the Night as a veil  
O'er the Day. Behold, verily  
In these things there are Signs  
For those who consider!

4\. And in the earth are tracts  
(Diverse though) neighbouring,  
And gardens of vines  
And fields sown with corn,  
And palm trees—growing  
Out of single roots or otherwise:  
Watered with the same water,  
Yet some of them We make  
More excellent than others to eat.  
Behold, verily in these things

<span id="page_604">p. 604</span>

There are Signs for those  
Who understand!

5\. If thou dost marvel  
(At their want of faith),  
Strange is their saying:  
"When we are (actually) dust,  
Shall we indeed then be  
In a creation renewed?" They are  
Those who deny their Lord! They  
Are those round whose necks  
Will be yokes (of servitude):  
They will be Companions  
Of the Fire, to dwell therein  
(For aye)!

6\. They ask thee to hasten on  
The evil in preference to the good:  
Yet have come to pass,  
Before them, (many) exemplary  
Punishments! But verily  
Thy Lord is full of forgiveness  
For mankind for their wrong-doing,  
And verily thy Lord  
Is (also) strict in punishment.

7\. And the Unbelievers say:  
"Why is not a Sign sent down  
To him from his Lord?  
But thou art truly

<span id="page_605">p. 605</span>

A warner, and to every people  
A guide.

##### SECTION 2.

8\. God doth know what  
Every female (womb) doth bear,  
By how much the wombs  
Fall short (of their time  
Or number) or do exceed.  
Every single thing is before  
His sight, in (due) proportion.

9\. He knoweth the Unseen  
And that which is open:  
He is the Great,  
The most High.

10\. It is the same (to Him)  
Whether any of you  
Conceal his speech or  
Declare it openly;  
Whether he lie hid by night  
Or walk forth freely by day.

11\. For each (such person)  
There are (angels) in succession,  
Before and behind him:  
They guard him by command

<span id="page_606">p. 606</span>

Of God. Verily never  
Will God change the condition  
Of a people until they  
Change it themselves  
(With their own souls).  
But when (once) God willeth  
A people's punishment,  
There can be no  
Turning it back, nor  
Will they find, besides Him,  
Any to protect

12\. It is He Who doth show you  
The lightning, by way  
Both of fear and of hope:  
It is He Who doth raise up  
The clouds, heavy  
With (fertilising) rain!

13\. Nay, thunder repeateth His praises,  
And so do the angels, with awe:  
He flingeth the loud-voiced  
Thunder-bolts, and therewith  
He striketh whomsoever He will…  
Yet these (are the men)  
Who (dare to) dispute  
About God, with the strength  
Of His power (supreme)!

<span id="page_607">p. 607</span>

14\. For Him (alone) is prayer  
In Truth: any others that they  
Call upon besides Him hear them  
No more than if they were  
To stretch forth their hands  
For water to reach their mouths  
But it reaches them not:  
For the prayer of those  
Without Faith is nothing  
But (futile) wandering (in the mind).

15\. Whatever beings there are  
In the heavens and the earth  
Do prostrate themselves to God  
(Acknowledging subjection),—with good-will  
Or in spite of themselves:  
So do their shadows  
In the mornings and evenings.

<span id="page_608">p. 608</span>

16\. Say: "Who is the Lord and Sustainer  
Of the heavens and the earth?"  
Say: "(It is) God."  
Say: "Do ye then take  
(For worship) protectors other  
Than Him, such as have  
No power either for good  
Or for harm to themselves?"  
Say: "Are the blind equal  
With those who see?  
Or the depths of darkness  
Equal with Light?"  
Or do they assign to God  
Partners who have created  
(Anything) as He has created,  
So that the creation seemed  
To them similar?  
Say: "God is the Creator  
Of all things: He is  
The One, the Supreme and  
Irresistible."

17\. He sends down water  
From the sides, and the channels  
Flow, each according to its measure:  
But the torrent bears away  
The foam that mounts up  
To the surface. Even so,

<span id="page_609">p. 609</span>

Form that (ore) which they heat  
In the fire, to make ornaments  
Or utensils therewith,  
There is a scum likewise.  
Thus doth God (by parables)  
Show forth Truth and Vanity.  
For the scum disappears  
Like froth cast out;  
While that which is for the good  
Of mankind remains  
On the earth. Thus doth God  
Set forth parables.

18\. For those who respond  
To their Lord, are (all)  
Good things. But those  
Who respond not to Him,  
Even if they had all  
That is in the heavens  
And on earth, and as much more,  
(In vain) would they offer it  
For ransom. For them  
Will the reckoning be terrible:  
Their abode will be Hell,——  
What a bed of misery!

##### SECTION 3.

19\. Is then one who doth know  
That that which hath been

<span id="page_610">p. 610</span>

Revealed unto thee  
From thy Lord is the Truth,  
Like one who is blind?  
It is those who are  
Endued with understanding  
That receive admonition;—

20\. Those who fulfil the Covenant  
Of God and fail not  
In their plighted word;

21\. Those who join together  
Those things which God  
Hath commanded to be joined,  
Hold their Lord in awe,  
And fear the terrible reckoning;

22\. Those who patiently persevere,  
Seeking the countenance of their Lord;  
Establish regular prayers; spend,  
Out of (the gifts) We have bestowed  
For their sustenance, secretly  
And openly; and turn off Evil  
With good: for such there is  
The final attainment  
Of the (Eternal) Home,—

23\. Gardens of perpetual bliss:  
They shall enter there,  
As well as the righteous  
Among their fathers, their spouses,

<span id="page_611">p. 611</span>

And their offspring:  
And angels shall enter unto them  
From every gate (with the salutation):

24\. "Peace unto you for that ye  
Persevered in patience! Now  
How excellent is the final Home!"

25\. But those who break  
The Covenant of God, after  
Having plighted their word thereto,  
And cut asunder those things  
Which God has commanded  
To be joined, and work mischief  
In the land;—on them  
Is the Curse; for them  
Is the terrible Home!

26\. God doth enlarge, or grant  
By (strict) measure, the Sustenance  
(Which He giveth) to whomso  
He pleaseth. (The worldly) rejoice  
In the life of this world:  
But the life of this world  
Is but little comfort  
In the Hereafter.

<span id="page_612">p. 612</span>

##### SECTION 4.

27\. The Unbelievers say: "Why  
Is not a Sign sent down  
To him from his Lord?"  
Say: "Truly God leaveth,  
To stray, whom He will;  
But He guideth to Himself  
Those who turn to Him  
In penitence,—

28\. "Those who believe, and whose hearts  
Find satisfaction in the remembrance  
Of God: for without doubt  
In the remembrance of God  
Do hearts find satisfaction.

29\. "For those who believe  
And work righteousness,  
Is (every) blessedness,  
And a beautiful place  
Of (final) return."

30\. Thus have We sent thee  
Amongst a People before whom  
(Long since) have (other) Peoples  
(Gone and) passed away;  
In order that thou mightest  
Rehearse unto them what We  
Send down unto thee by inspiration;

<span id="page_613">p. 613</span>

Yet do they reject (Him),  
The Most Gracious!  
Say: "He is my Lord!  
There is no god but He!  
On Him is my trust,  
And to Him do I turn!"

31\. If there were a Qur-ān  
With which mountains were moved,  
Or the earth were cloven asunder,  
Or the dead were made to speak,  
(This would be the one!)  
But, truly, the Command is  
With God in all things!'  
Do not the Believers know,  
That, had God (so) willed,  
He could have guided  
All mankind (to the Right)?

But the Unbelievers,—never  
Will disaster cease to seize  
Them for their (ill) deeds,  
Or to settle close to their homes,  
Until the promise of God  
Come to pass, for, verily,  
God will not fail  
In His promise.

<span id="page_614">p. 614</span>

##### SECTION 5.

32\. Mocked were (many) apostles  
Before thee: but I granted  
Respite to the Unbelievers,  
And finally I punished them:  
Then how (terrible) was My requital!

33\. Is then He Who standeth  
Over every soul (and knoweth)  
All that it doth,  
(Like any others)? And yet  
They ascribe partners to God.  
Say: "But name them!  
Is it that ye will  
Inform Him of something  
He knoweth not on earth,  
Or is it (just) a show  
Of words?" Nay! to those  
Who believe not, their pretence  
seems pleasing, but they are  
Kept back (thereby) from the Path.  
And those whom God leaves  
To stray, no one can guide.

34\. For them is a Penalty  
In the life of this world,  
But harder, truly, is the Penalty  
Of the Hereafter: and defender  
Have they none against God.

35\. The parable of the Garden  
Which the righteous are promised!—

<span id="page_615">p. 615</span>

Beneath it flow rivers:  
Perpetual is the enjoyment thereof  
And the shade therein:  
Such is the End  
Of the Righteous; and the End  
Of Unbelievers is the Fire.

36\. Those to whom We have  
Given the Book rejoice  
At what hath been revealed  
Unto thee: but there are  
Among the clans those who reject  
A part thereof. Say:  
"I am commanded to worship  
God, and not to join partners  
With Him. Unto him  
Do I call, and  
Unto Him is my return."

37\. Thus have We revealed it  
To be a judgment of authority

<span id="page_616">p. 616</span>

In Arabic. Wert thou to follow  
Their (vain) desires after the knowledge  
Which hath reached thee,  
Then wouldst thou find  
Neither protector nor defender  
Against God.

##### SECTION 6.

38\. We did send apostles  
Before thee, and appointed  
For them wives and children:  
And it was never the part  
Of an apostle to bring a Sign  
Except as God permitted  
(Or commanded). For each period  
Is a Book (revealed).

39\. God doth blot out  
Or confirm what He pleaseth:  
With Him is  
The Mother of the Book.

40\. Whether We shall show thee  
(Within thy life-time)  
Part of what We promised them  
Or take to ourselves thy soul

<span id="page_617">p. 617</span>

(Before it is all accomplished),—  
Thy duty is to make  
(The Message) reach them:  
It is Our part  
To call them to account.

41\. See they not that We  
Gradually reduce the land  
(In their control) from its  
Outlying borders ? (Where) God  
Commands, there is none  
To put back His command:  
And He is Swift  
In calling to account.

42\. Those before them did (also)  
Devise plots; but in all things  
The master-planning is God's.  
He knoweth the doings  
Of every soul: and soon  
Will the Unbelievers know  
Who gets home in the End.

43\. The Unbelievers say: "No apostle  
Art thou." Say: "Enough  
For a witness between me  
And you is God, and such  
As have knowledge of the Book."
