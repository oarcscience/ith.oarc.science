### Sūra LXXIII.

### *Muzzammil,* or Folded in Garments.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. O thou folded  
In garments!

2\. Stand (to prayer) by night,  
But not all night,—

3\. Half of it,—  
Or a little less,

4\. Or a little more;  
And recite the Qur-ān  
In slow, measured rhythmic tones.

5\. Soon shall We send down  
To thee a weighty Message.

6\. Truly the rising by night  
Is most potent for governing  
(The soul), and most suitable  
For (framing) the Word  
(Of Prayer and Praise).

<span id="page_1634">p. 1634</span>

7\. True, there is for thee  
By day prolonged occupation  
With ordinary duties:

8\. But keep in remembrance  
The name of thy Lord  
And devote thyself  
To Him whole-heartedly.

9\. (He is) Lord of the East  
And the West: there is  
No god but He:  
Take Him therefore  
For (thy) Disposer of Affairs.

10\. And have patience with what  
They say, and leave them  
With noble (dignity).

11\. And leave Me  
(Alone to deal with)  
Those in possession of  
The good things of life,  
Who (yet) deny the Truth;  
And bear with them  
For a little while.

12\. With Us are Fetters

<span id="page_1635">p. 1635</span>

(To bind them), and a Fire  
(To burn them),

13\. And a Food that chokes,  
And a Penalty Grievous.

14\. One Day the earth  
And the mountains  
Will be in violent commotion.  
And the mountains will be  
As a heap of sand  
Poured out and flowing down.

15\. We have sent to you,  
(O men!) an apostle,  
To be a witness concerning you,  
Even as We sent  
An apostle to Pharaoh.

<span id="page_1636">p. 1636</span>

16\. But Pharaoh disobeyed  
The apostle; so We  
Seized him with  
A heavy Punishment.

17\. Then how shall ye,  
If ye deny (God),  
Guard yourselves against  
A Day that will make  
Children hoary-headed?—

18\. Whereon the sky will be  
Cleft asunder?  
His Promise needs must  
Be accomplished.

19\. Verily this is an Admonition:  
Therefore, whoso will, let him  
Take a (straight) path  
To his Lord!

##### SECTION 2.

20\. Thy Lord doth know  
That thou standest forth  
(To prayer) nigh two-thirds  
Of the night, or half

<span id="page_1637">p. 1637</span>

The night, or a third  
Of the night, and so doth  
A party of those with thee.  
But God doth appoint Night  
And Day in due measure.  
He knoweth that ye are  
Unable to keep count thereof.  
So He hath turned to you  
(In mercy): read ye,  
Therefore, of the Qur-ān  
As much as may be  
Easy for you. He knoweth  
That there may be (some)  
Among you in ill-health;  
Others travelling through the land,  
Seeking of God's bounty;  
Yet others fighting  
In God's Cause. Read ye,  
Therefore, as much of the Qur-ān  
As may be easy (for you);  
And establish regular Prayer  
And give regular Charity;  
And loan to God  
A Beautiful Loan.

<span id="page_1638">p. 1638</span>

And whatever good  
Ye send forth  
For your souls,  
Ye shall find it  
In God's Presence,—  
Yea, better and  
Greater, in Reward.  
And seek ye the Grace  
Of God: for God is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
