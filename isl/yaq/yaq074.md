### Sūra LXXIV.

### *Mudda<u>thth</u>ir,* or One Wrapped Up.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*

1\. O thou wrapped up  
(In a mantle)!

2\. Arise and deliver thy warning!

3\. And thy Lord  
Do thou magnify!

4\. And thy garments  
Keep free from stain!

5\. And all abomination shun!

6\. Nor expect, in giving,  
Any increase (for thyself)!

<span id="page_1641">p. 1641</span>

7\. But, for thy Lord's (Cause),  
Be patient and constant!

8\. Finally, when the trumpet  
Is sounded,

9\. That will be—that Day—  
A Day of Distress,—

10\. Far from easy  
For those without Faith.

11\. Leave Me alone, (to deal)  
With the (creature) whom  
I created (bare and) alone!—

12\. To whom I granted  
Resources in abundance,

13\. And sons to be  
By his side!—

14\. To whom I made  
(Life) smooth and comfortable!

15\. Yet is he greedy—  
That I should add  
(Yet more);—

<span id="page_1642">p. 1642</span>

16\. By no means!  
For to Our Signs  
He has been refractory!

17\. Soon will I visit him  
With a mount of calamities!

18\. For he thought  
And he plotted;—

19\. And woe to him!  
How he plotted!—

20\. Yea, woe to him:  
How he plotted!—

21\. Then he looked round;

22\. Then he frowned  
And he scowled;

23\. Then he turned back  
And was haughty;

24\. Then said he:  
"This is nothing but magic,  
Derived from of old;

25\. "This is nothing but  
The word of a mortal!"

26\. Soon will I  
Cast him into Hell-Fire!

<span id="page_1643">p. 1643</span>

27\. And what will explain  
To thee what Hell-Fire is?

28\. Naught doth it permit  
To endure, and naught  
Doth it leave alone!—

29\. Darkening and changing  
The colour of man!

30\. Over it are Nineteen.

31\. And We have set none  
But angels as guardians  
Of the Fire; and We  
Have fixed their number

<span id="page_1644">p. 1644</span>

Only as a trial  
For Unbelievers,—in order  
That the People of the Book  
May arrive at certainty,  
And the Believers may increase  
In Faith,—and that no doubts  
May be left for the People  
Of the Book and the Believers,  
And that those in whose hearts  
Is a disease and the Unbelievers  
May say, "What symbol  
Doth God intend by this?  
Thus doth God leave to stray  
Whom He pleaseth, and guide  
Whom He pleaseth: and none  
Can know the forces  
Of thy Lord, except He.  
And this is no other than  
A warning to mankind.

##### SECTION 2.

32\. Nay, verily:  
By the Moon,

<span id="page_1645">p. 1645</span>

33\. And by the Night  
As it retreateth,

34\. And by the Dawn  
As it shineth forth,—

35\. This is but one  
Of the mighty (portents),

36\. A warning to mankind,—

37\. To any of you that  
Chooses to press forward,  
Or to follow behind;—

38\. Every soul will be (held)  
In pledge for its deeds.

39\. Except the Companions  
Of the Right Hand.

<span id="page_1646">p. 1646</span>

40\. (They will be) in Gardens  
(Of Delight): they will  
Question each other,

41\. And (ask) of the Sinners:

42\. "What led you  
Into Hell-Fire?"

43\. They will say:  
"We were not of those  
Who prayed;

44\. "Nor were we of those  
Who fed the indigent;

45\. "But we used to talk  
Vanities with vain talkers;

46\. "And we used to deny  
The Day of Judgment,

47\. "Until there came to us  
(The Hour) that is certain."

48\. Then will no intercession  
Of (any) intercessors  
Profit them.

49\. When what is  
The matter with them  
That they turn away  
From admonition?

50\. As if they were  
Affrighted asses,

<span id="page_1647">p. 1647</span>

51\. Fleeing from a lion!

52\. Forsooth, each one of them  
Wants to be given  
Scrolls (of revelation) spread out!

53\. By no means! But  
They fear not the Hereafter.

54\. Nay, this surely  
Is an admonition:

55\. Let any who will,  
Keep it in remembrance!

56\. But none will keep it  
In remembrance except  
As God wills: He  
Is the Lord of Righteousness,  
And the Lord of Forgiveness.
