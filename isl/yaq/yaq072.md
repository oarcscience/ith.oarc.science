### Sūra LXXII.

### *Jinn,* or the Spirits.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Say: It has been  
Revealed to me that  
A company of Jinns  
Listened (to the Qur-ān).  
They said, 'We have  
Really heard a wonderful Recital!

2\. 'It gives guidance  
To the Right,  
And we have believed therein:  
We shall not join (in worship)  
Any (gods) with our Lord.

3\. 'And exalted is the Majesty  
Of our Lord: He has  
Taken neither a wife  
Nor a son.

4\. 'There were some foolish ones  
Among us, who used  
To utter extravagant lies  
Against God;

5\. 'But we do think  
That no man or spirit

<span id="page_1626">p. 1626</span>

Should say aught that is  
Untrue against God.

6\. 'True, there were persons  
Among mankind who took shelter  
With persons among the Jinns,  
But they increased them  
In folly.

7\. 'And they (came to) think  
As ye thought, that God  
Would not raise up  
Any one (to Judgment).

8\. 'And we pried into  
The secrets of heaven;  
But we found it filled  
With stern guards  
And flaming fires.

9\. 'We used, indeed, to sit there  
In (hidden) stations, to (steal)  
A hearing; but any  
Who listens now  
Will find a flaming fire  
Watching him in ambush.

<span id="page_1627">p. 1627</span>

10\. 'And we understand not  
Whether ill is intended  
To those on earth,  
Or whether their Lord  
(Really) intends to guide  
Them to right conduct.

11\. 'There are among us  
Some that are righteous,  
And some the contrary:  
We follow divergent paths.

12\. 'But we think that we  
Can by no means frustrate  
God throughout the earth,  
Nor can we frustrate Him  
By flight.

13\. 'And as for us,  
Since we have listened  
To the Guidance, we have  
Accepted it: and any  
Who believes in his Lord  
Has no fear, either  
Of a short (account)  
Or of any injustice.

14\. 'Amongst us are some  
That submit their wills  
(To God), and some  
That swerve from justice.  
Now those who submit  
Their wills—they have

<span id="page_1628">p. 1628</span>

Sought out (the path)  
Of right conduct:

15\. 'But those who swerve,—  
They are (but) fuel  
For Hell-fire'—

16\. (And God's Message is):  
"If they (the Pagans)  
Had (only) remained  
On the (right) Way,  
We should certainly have  
Bestowed on them Rain  
In abundance.

17\. "That We might try them  
By that (means).  
But if any turns away  
From the remembrance  
Of his Lord, He will  
Cause him to undergo  
A severe Penalty.

18\. "And the places of worship  
Are for God (alone):  
So invoke not any one  
Along with God;

<span id="page_1629">p. 1629</span>

19\. "Yet when the Devotee  
Of God stands forth  
To invoke Him, they just  
Make round him a dense crowd."

##### SECTION 2.

20\. Say: "I do  
No more than invoke  
My Lord, and I join not  
With Him any (false god)."

21\. Say: "It is not  
In my power to cause  
You harm, or to bring  
You to right conduct."

22\. Say: "No one can  
Deliver me from God  
(If I were to disobey Him),  
Nor should I find refuge  
Except in Him,

23\. "Unless I proclaim what  
I receive from God  
And His Messages:  
For any that disobey God  
And His Apostle,—for them  
Is Hell: they shall dwell  
Therein for ever."

<span id="page_1630">p. 1630</span>

24\. At length, when they  
See (with their own eyes)  
That which they are promised,—  
Then will they know  
Who it is that is  
Weakest in (his) helper  
And least important  
In point of numbers.

25\. Say: "I know not whether  
The (Punishment) which ye  
Are promised is near,  
Or whether my Lord  
Will appoint for it  
A distant term.

26\. "He (alone) knows the Unseen,  
Nor does He make any one  
Acquainted with his Mysteries,—

27\. "Except an apostle  
Whom He has chosen:

<span id="page_1631">p. 1631</span>

And then He makes  
A band of watchers  
March before him  
And behind him,

28\. "That he may know  
That they have (truly)  
Brought and delivered  
The Messages of their Lord:  
And He surrounds  
(All the mysteries) that are  
With them, and takes account  
Of every single thing."
