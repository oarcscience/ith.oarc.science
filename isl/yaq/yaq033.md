### Sūra XXXIII.

### *Aḥzāb*, or The Confederates.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. O Prophet! Fear God,  
And hearken not  
To the Unbelievers  
And the Hypocrites:  
Verily god is full  
Of knowledge and wisdom.

2\. But follow that which  
Comes to thee by inspiration  
From thy Lord: for God  
Is well acquainted  
With (all) that ye do.

3\. And put thy trust  
In God, and enough is God  
As a Disposer of affairs.

4\. God has not made  
For any man two hearts

<span id="page_1103">p. 1103</span>

In his (one) body: nor has  
He made your wives whom  
Ye divorce by Ẓihār  
Your mothers: nor has He  
Made your adopted sons  
Your sons. Such is (only)  
Your (manner of) speech  
By your mouths. but God  
Tells (you) the Truth, and He  
Shows the (right) Way.

5\. Call them by (the names  
Of) their fathers: that is  
Juster in the sight of God.  
But if ye know not  
Their father's (names, call  
Them) your Brothers in faith,  
Or your *Maulās.  
*But there is no blame  
On you if ye make  
A mistake therein:  
(What counts is)  
The intention of your hearts:  
And god is Oft-Returning,  
Most Merciful.

<span id="page_1104">p. 1104</span>

6\. The Prophet is closer  
To the Believers than  
Their own selves,  
And his wives are  
Their mothers. Blood-relations  
Among each other have  
Closer personal ties,  
In the Decree of God.  
Than (the Brotherhood of)  
Believers and Muhājirs:  
Nevertheless do ye  
What is just to your  
Closest friends: such is  
The writing in the Decree  
(Of God).

7\. And remember We took  
From the Prophets their  
Covenant:  
As (We did) from thee:  
From Noah, Abraham, Moses,  
And Jesus the son of Mary:  
We took from them  
A solemn Covenant:

<span id="page_1105">p. 1105</span>

8\. That (God) may question  
The (Custodians) of Truth concerning  
The Truth they (were charged with):  
And He has prepared  
For the Unbelievers  
A grievous Penalty.

##### SECTION 2.

9\. O ye who believe!  
Remember the Grace of God,  
(Bestowed) on you, when  
There came down on you  
Hosts (to overwhelm you):  
But We sent against them

<span id="page_1106">p. 1106</span>

A hurricane and forces  
That ye saw not:  
But God sees (clearly)  
All that ye do.

10\. Behold! they came on you  
From above you and from  
Below you, and behold,  
The eyes became dim  
And the hearts gaped  
Up to the throats,  
And ye imagined various  
(Vain) thoughts about God!

11\. In that situation  
Were the Believers tried:  
They were shaken as by  
A tremendous shaking.

12\. Find behold! The Hypocrites  
And those in whose hearts  
Is a disease (even) say: "God  
And His Apostle promised us  
Nothing but delusions!"

13\. Behold! A party among them  
Said: "Ye men of Ya<u>th</u>rib!  
Ye cannot stand (the attack)!  
Therefore go back!"  
And a band of them  
Ask for leave of the Prophet,

<span id="page_1107">p. 1107</span>

Saying, "Truly our houses  
Are bare and exposed," though  
They were not exposed:  
They intended nothing but  
To run away.

14\. And if an entry had  
Been effected to them  
From the sides of the (City),  
And they had been  
Incited to sedition.  
They would certainly have  
Brought it to pass, with  
None but a brief delay!

15\. And yet they had already  
Covenanted with God not to turn  
Their backs, and a covenant  
With God must (surely)  
Be answered for.

16\. Say: "Running away will not  
Profit you if ye are  
Running away from death  
Or slaughter; and even if  
(Ye do escape), no more  
Than a brief (respite)  
Will ye be allowed to enjoy!"

<span id="page_1108">p. 1108</span>

17\. Say: "Who is it that can  
Screen you from God  
If it be His wish  
To give you Punishment  
Or to give you Mercy?"  
Nor will they find for themselves,  
Besides God, any protector  
Or helper.

18\. Verily God knows those  
Among you who keep back  
(Men) and those who say  
To their brethren, "Come along  
To us", but come not  
To the fight except  
For just a little while,

19\. Covetous over you  
Then when fear comes,  
Thou wilt see them looking  
To thee, their eyes revolving,  
Like (those of) one over whom  
Hovers death: but when  
The fear is past,  
They will smite you  
With sharp tongues, covetous  
Of goods. Such men have  
No faith, and so God  
Has made their deeds  
Of none effect: and that  
Is easy for God.

<span id="page_1109">p. 1109</span>

20\. They think that the Confederates  
Have not withdrawn; and if  
The Confederates should come (again),  
They would wish they were  
In the deserts (wandering)  
Among the Bedouins, and  
Seeking news about you  
(From a safe distance);  
And if they were  
In your midst, they  
Would fight but little.

##### SECTION 3.

21\. Ye have indeed  
In the Apostle of God  
A beautiful pattern (of conduct)  
For any one whose hope is  
In God and the Final Day,  
And who engages much  
In the praise of God.

<span id="page_1110">p. 1110</span>

22\. When the Believers saw  
The Confederate forces,  
They said: "This is  
What God and His Apostle is  
Had promised us, and God  
And His Apostle told us  
What was true." And it  
Only added to their faith  
And their zeal in obedience.

23\. Among the Believers are then  
Who have been true to  
Their Covenant with God:  
Of them some have completed  
Their vow (to the extreme),  
And some (still) wait:  
But they have never changed  
(Their determination) in the least:

24\. That God may reward  
The men of Truth for  
Their Truth, and punish  
The Hypocrites if that be

<span id="page_1111">p. 1111</span>

His Will, or turn to them  
In Mercy: for God is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

25\. And God turned back  
The Unbelievers for (all)  
Their fury: no advantage  
Did they gain; and enough  
Is God for the Believers  
In their fight. And God  
Is full of Strength, Able  
To enforce His Will.

26\. And those of the people  
Of the Book who aided  
Them—God did take them  
Down from their strongholds

<span id="page_1112">p. 1112</span>

And cast terror into  
Their hearts, (so that)  
Some ye slew, and some  
Ye made prisoners,

27\. And He made you heirs  
Of their lands, their houses,  
And their goods,  
And of a land which

<span id="page_1113">p. 1113</span>

Ye had not frequented  
(Before). And God has  
Power over all things.

##### SECTION 4.

28\. O Prophet! say  
To thy Consorts:  
"If it be that ye desire  
The life of this world,  
And its glitter,—then come!  
I will provide for your

<span id="page_1114">p. 1114</span>

Enjoyment and set you free  
In a handsome manner.

29\. But if ye seek God  
And His Apostle, and  
The Home of the Hereafter,  
Verily God has prepared  
For the well-doers amongst you  
A great reward.

30\. O Consorts of the Prophet  
If any of you were guilty  
Of evident unseemly conduct,  
The Punishment would be  
Doubled to her, and that  
Is easy for God

<span id="page_1115">p. 1115</span>

31\. But any of you that is  
Devout in the service of  
God and His Apostle,  
And works righteousness,—  
To her shall We grant  
Her reward twice: and We  
Have prepared for her  
A generous Sustenance.

32\. O Consorts of the Prophet!  
Ye are not like any  
Of the (other) women:  
If ye do fear (God),  
Be not too complaisant  
Of speech, lest one  
In whose heart is  
A disease should be moved  
With desire: but speak ye  
A speech (that is) just.

33\. And stay quietly in  
Your houses, and make not  
A dazzling display, like  
That of the former Times  
Of Ignorance; and establish  
Regular Prayer, and give  
Regular Charity; and obey  
God and His Apostle.  
And God only wishes  
To remove all abomination

<span id="page_1116">p. 1116</span>

From you, ye Members  
Of the Family, and to make  
You pure and spotless.

34\. And recite what is  
Rehearsed to you in your  
Homes, of the Signs of God  
And His Wisdom:  
For God understands  
The finest mysteries and  
Is well-acquainted (with them).

##### SECTION 5.

35\. For Muslim men and women,—  
For believing men and women,  
For devout men and women,  
For true men and women,  
For men and women who are  
Patient and constant, for men  
And women who humble themselves  
For men and women who give  
In charity, for men and women  
Who fast (and deny themselves),  
For men and women who  
Guard their chastity, and  
For men and women who

<span id="page_1117">p. 1117</span>

Engage much in God's praise,—  
For them has God prepared  
Forgiveness and great reward.

36\. It is not fitting  
For a Believer, man or woman.  
When a matter has been decided  
By God and His Apostle,  
To have any option  
About their decision:  
If any one disobeys God  
And His Apostle, he is indeed  
On a clearly wrong Path.

37\. Behold! thou didst say  
To one who had received  
The grace of God  
And thy favour: "Retain thou  
(In wedlock) thy wife,  
And fear God." But thou  
Didst hide in thy heart  
That which God was about  
To make manifest: thou didst  
Fear the people, but it is

<span id="page_1118">p. 1118</span>

More fitting that thou shouldst  
Fear God. Then when Zaid  
Had dissolved (his marriage)  
With her, with the necessary  
(Formality), We joined her  
In marriage to thee:  
In order that (in future)  
There may be no difficulty  
To the Believers in (the matter  
Of) marriage with the vives  
Of their adopted sons, when  
The latter have dissolved  
With the necessary (formality)  
(Their marriage) with them.  
And God's command must  
Be fulfilled.

38\. There can be no difficulty  
To the Prophet in what  
God has indicated to him  
As a duty. It was  
The practice (approved) of God  
Amongst those of old  
That have passed away.  
And the command of God  
Is a decree determined.

39\. (It is the practice of those)  
Who preach the Messages  
Of God, and fear Him,  
And fear none but God.

<span id="page_1119">p. 1119</span>

And enough is God  
To call (men) to account.

40\. Muhammad is not  
The father of any  
Of your men, but (he is)  
The Apostle of God,  
And the Seal of the Prophets:  
And God has full knowledge  
Of all things.

##### SECTION 6.

41\. O ye who believe!  
Celebrate the praises of God,  
And do this often;

42\. And glorify Him  
Morning and evening.

43\. He it is Who sends  
Blessings on you, as do  
His angels, that He may  
Bring you out from the depths  
Of Darkness into Light:  
And He is Full of Mercy  
To the Believers.

44\. Their salutation on the Day  
They meet Him will be  
"Peace!"; and He has  
Prepared for them  
A generous Reward.

45\. O Prophet! Truly We  
Have sent thee as

<span id="page_1120">p. 1120</span>

A Witness, a Bearer  
Of Glad Tidings,  
And a Warner,—

46\. And as one who invites  
To God's (Grace) by His leave,  
And as a Lamp  
Spreading Light.

47\. Then give the glad tidings  
To the Believers, that  
They shall have from God  
A very great Bounty.

48\. And obey not (the behests)  
Of the Unbelievers  
And the Hypocrites,  
And heed not their annoyances,  
But put thy trust in God.  
For enough is God  
As a Disposer of affairs.

49\. O ye who believe!  
When ye marry believing women,  
And then divorce them  
Before ye have touched them,

<span id="page_1121">p. 1121</span>

No period of ’Iddat  
Have ye to count  
In respect of them:  
So give them a present,  
And set them free  
In a handsome manner.

50\. O Prophet! We have  
Made lawful to thee  
Thy wives to whom thou  
Hast paid their dowers;  
And those whom thy  
Right hand possesses out of  
The prisoners of war whom  
God has assigned to thee;  
And daughters of thy paternal  
Uncles and aunts, and daughters  
Of thy maternal uncles  
And aunts, who migrated  
(From Mecca) with thee;  
And any believing woman  
Who dedicates her soul

<span id="page_1122">p. 1122</span>

To the Prophet if the Prophet  
Wishes to wed her;—this  
Only for thee, and not  
For the Believers (at large);  
We know what We have  
Appointed for them as to  
Their wives and the captives  
Whom their right hands  
Possess;—in order that  
There should be no difficulty  
For thee. And God is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

51\. Thou mayest defer (the turn  
Of) any of them that thou  
Pleasest, and thou mayest receive  
Any thou pleasest: and there  
Is no blame on thee if  
Thou invite one whose (turn)

<span id="page_1123">p. 1123</span>

Thou hadst set aside.  
This were nigher to  
The cooling of their eyes,  
The prevention of their grief,  
And their satisfaction—  
That of all of them—  
With that which thou  
Hast to give them:  
And God knows (all)  
That is in your hearts:  
And God is All-Knowing,  
Most Forbearing.

52\. It is not lawful for thee  
(To marry more) women  
After this, nor to change  
Them for (other) wives,  
Even though their beauty  
Attract thee, except any  
Thy right hand should  
Possess (as handmaidens):  
And God doth watch  
Over all things.

<span id="page_1124">p. 1124</span>

##### SECTION 7.

53\. O ye who believe!  
Enter not the Prophet's houses,—  
Until leave is given you,  
For a meal, (and then)  
Not (so early as) to wait  
For its preparation: but when  
Ye are invited, enter;  
And when ye have taken  
Your meal, disperse,  
Without seeking familiar talk.  
Such (behaviour) annoys  
The Prophet: he is ashamed  
To dismiss you, but  
God is not ashamed  
(To tell you) the truth.  
And when ye  
Ask (his ladies)  
For anything ye want,  
Ask them from before  
A screen: that makes  
For greater purity for  
Your hearts and for theirs.  
Nor is it right for you

<span id="page_1125">p. 1125</span>

That ye should annoy  
God's Apostle, or that  
Ye should marry his widows  
After him at any time.  
Truly such a thing is  
In God's sight an enormity.

54\. Whether ye reveal anything  
Or conceal it, verily  
God has full knowledge  
Of all things.

55\. There is no blame  
(On these ladies if they  
Appear) before their fathers  
Or their sons, their brothers,  
Or their brothers’ sons,  
Or their sisters’ sons,  
Or their women,  
Or the (slaves) whom  
Their right hands possess.  
And, (ladies), fear God;  
For God is Witness  
To all things.

56\. God and His Angels  
Send blessings on the Prophet:

<span id="page_1126">p. 1126</span>

O ye that believe!  
Send ye blessings on him,  
And salute him  
With all respect.

57\. Those who annoy  
God and His Apostle—  
God has cursed them  
In this world and  
In the Hereafter,  
And has prepared for them  
A humiliating Punishment.

58\. And those who annoy  
Believing men and women  
Undeservedly, bear  
(on themselves)  
A calumny and a glaring sin.

##### SECTION 8.

59\. O Prophet! Tell  
Thy wives and daughters,  
And the believing women,  
That they should cast  
Their outer garments over  
Their persons (when abroad):  
That is most convenient,  
That they should be known

<span id="page_1127">p. 1127</span>

(As such) and not molested.  
And God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

60\. Truly, if the Hypocrites,  
And those in whose hearts  
Is a disease, and those who  
Stir up sedition in the City,  
Desist not, We shall certainly  
Stir thee up against them:  
Then will they not be  
Able to stay in it  
As thy neighbours  
For any length of time:

61\. They shall have a curse  
On them: wherever they  
Are found, they shall be  
Seized and slain  
(Without mercy).

62\. (Such was) the practice  
(Approved) of God among those  
Who lived aforetime:  
No change wilt thou find  
In the practice (approved)  
Of God.

<span id="page_1128">p. 1128</span>

63\. Men ask thee concerning  
The Hour: say, "The knowledge  
Thereof is with God (alone)":  
And what will make thee  
Understand?—perchance  
The Hour is nigh!

64\. Verily God has cursed  
The Unbelievers and prepared  
For them a Blazing Fire,—

65\. To dwell therein for ever:  
No protector will they find,  
Nor helper.

66\. The Day that their faces  
Will be turned upside down  
In the Fire, they will say:  
"Woe to us! would that  
We had obeyed God  
And obeyed the Apostle!"

67\. And they would say:  
"Our Lord! We obeyed  
Our chiefs and our great ones,  
And they misled us  
As to the (right) path.

68\. "Our Lord! Give them  
Double Penalty  
And curse them  
With a very great Curse!"

<span id="page_1129">p. 1129</span>

##### SECTION 9.

69\. O ye who believe!  
Be ye not like those  
Who vexed and insulted Moses,  
But God cleared him  
Of the (calumnies) they  
Had uttered: and he  
Was honourable in God's sight.

70\. O ye who believe!  
Fear God, and (always) say  
A word directed to the Right:

71\. That He may make  
Your conduct whole and sound  
And forgive you your sins:  
He that obeys God  
And His Apostle, has already  
Attained the highest  
Achievement.

72\. We did indeed offer  
The Trust to the Heavens

<span id="page_1130">p. 1130</span>

And the Earth  
And the Mountains;  
But they refused  
To undertake it,  
Being afraid thereof:  
But man undertook it;—  
He was indeed unjust  
And foolish;—

<span id="page_1131">p. 1131</span>

73\. (With the result (that  
God has to punish  
The Hypocrites, men and women,  
And the Unbelievers, men  
And women, and God turns  
In Mercy to the Believers,  
Men and women: for God  
Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
