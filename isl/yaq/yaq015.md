### Sūra XV.

### *Al-Hijr*, or The Rocky Tract.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious;  
Most Merciful*

1\. A. L. R. These are  
The Āyats of Revelation,—  
Of a Qur-ān  
That makes things clear.

<span id="page_637">p. 637</span>

2\. Again and again will those  
Who disbelieve, wish that they  
Had bowed (to God's Will)  
In Islam.

3\. Leave them alone, to enjoy  
(The good things of this life)  
And to please themselves:  
Let (false) Hope amuse them: soon  
Will knowledge (undeceive them).

4\. Never did We destroy  
A population that had not  
A term decreed and assigned  
Beforehand.

5\. Neither can a people anticipate  
Its Term, nor delay it.

6\. They say: "O thou to whom  
The Message is being revealed!  
Truly thou art mad (or possessed)!

<span id="page_638">p. 638</span>

7\. "Why bringest thou not  
Angels to us if it be  
That thou hast the Truth?"

8\. We send not the angels  
Down except for just cause:  
If they came (to the ungodly),  
Behold! no respite would they have!

9\. We have, without doubt,  
Sent down the Message;  
And We will assuredly  
Guard it (from corruption).

10\. We did send apostles before thee  
Amongst the religious sects  
Of old:

11\. But never came an apostle  
To them but they mocked him.

12\. Even so do we let it creep  
Into the hearts of the sinners—

13\. That they should not believe  
In the (Message); but the ways

<span id="page_639">p. 639</span>

Of the ancients have passed away.

14\. Even if We opened out to them  
A gate from heaven,  
And they were to continue  
(All day) ascending therein,

15\. They would only say:  
"Our eyes have been intoxicated:  
Nay, we have been bewitched  
By sorcery."

##### SECTION 2.

16\. It is We Who have set out  
The Zodiacal Signs in the heavens,  
And made them fair-seeming  
To (all) beholders;

17\. And (moreover) We have guarded them

<span id="page_640">p. 640</span>

From every evil spirit accursed:

18\. But any that gains a hearing  
By stealth, is pursued  
By a flaming fire, bright (to see).

19\. And the earth We have spread out  
(Like a carpet); set thereon  
Mountains firm and immovable;  
And produced therein all kinds  
Of things in due balance.

20\. And We have provided therein  
Means of subsistence,—for you  
And for those for whose sustenance  
Ye are not responsible.

21\. And there is not a thing  
But its (sources and) treasures

<span id="page_641">p. 641</span>

(Inexhaustible) are with Us;  
But We only send down  
Thereof in due and ascertainable measures.

22\. And We send the fecundating winds,  
Then cause the rain to descend  
From the sky, therewith providing  
You with water (in abundance),  
Though ye are not the guardians  
Of its stores.

23\. And verily, it is We  
Who give life, and Who give  
Death: it is We Who remain Inheritors  
(After all else passes away).

<span id="page_642">p. 642</span>

24\. To Us are known those of you  
Who hasten forward, and those  
Who lag behind.

25\. Assuredly it is thy Lord  
Who will gather them together:  
For He is Perfect in Wisdom  
And Knowledge.

##### SECTION 3.

26\. We created man from sounding clay,  
From mud moulded into shape;

27\. And the Jinn race, We had  
Created before, from the fire  
Of a scorching wind.

28\. Behold! thy Lord said  
To the angels: "I am about  
To create man, from sounding clay  
From mud moulded into shape;

<span id="page_643">p. 643</span>

29\. "When I have fashioned him  
(In due proportion) and breathed  
Into him of My spirit,  
Fall ye down in obeisance  
Unto him.

30\. So the angels prostrated themselves,  
All of them together:

31\. Not so Iblīs: he refused to be  
Among those who prostrated themselves.

32\. (God) said: "O Iblīs!  
What is your reason  
For not being among those  
Who prostrated themselves?"

33\. (Iblīs) said: "I am not one  
To prostrate myself to man,  
Whom Thou didst create  
From sounding clay, from mud  
Moulded into shape."

34\. (God) said: "Then get thee out  
From here; for thou art  
Rejected, accursed.

35\. "And the Curse shall be  
On thee till the Day of Judgment."

<span id="page_644">p. 644</span>

36\. (Iblīs) said: "O my Lord!  
Give me then respite  
Till the Day  
The (dead) are raised."

37\. (God) said: "Respite  
Is granted thee—

38\. "Till the Day  
Of the Time Appointed."

39\. (Iblīs) said: "O my Lord!  
Because Thou hast put me  
In the wrong, I will  
Make (wrong) fair-seeming  
To them on the earth,  
And I will put them  
All in the wrong,—

40\. "Except Thy servants among them,  
Sincere and purified  
(By Thy grace)."

41\. (God) said: "This (Way  
Of My sincere servants) is  
Indeed a Way that leads  
Straight to Me.

<span id="page_645">p. 645</span>

42\. "For over My servants  
No authority shalt thou  
Have, except such as  
Put themselves in the wrong  
And follow thee."

43\. And verily, Hell  
Is the promised abode  
For them all!

44\. To it are seven Gates:  
For each of those Gates  
Is a (special) class  
(Of sinners) assigned.

##### SECTION 4.

45\. The righteous (will be)  
Amid Gardens  
And fountains  
(Of clear-flowing water).

46\. (Their greeting will be):  
"Enter ye here  
In Peace and Security."

47\. And We shall remove  
From their hearts any  
Lurking sense of injury:  
(They will be) brothers  
(Joyfully) facing each other  
On thrones (of dignity).

48\. There no sense of fatigue  
Shall touch them,  
Nor shall they (ever)  
Be asked to leave.

<span id="page_646">p. 646</span>

49\. Tell My servants  
That I am indeed  
The Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful;

50\. And that My Penalty  
Will be indeed  
The most grievous Penalty.

51\. Tell them about  
The guests of Abraham.

52\. When they entered his presence  
And said, "Peace!"  
He said, "We feel  
Afraid of you!"

53\. They said: "Fear not!  
We give thee glad tidings

<span id="page_647">p. 647</span>

Of a son endowed  
With wisdom."

54\. He said: "Do ye give me  
Glad tidings that old age  
Has seized me? Of what,  
Then, is your good news?"

55\. They said: "We give thee  
Glad tidings in truth:  
Be not then in despair!"

56\. He said: "And who  
Despairs of the mercy  
Of his Lord, but such  
As go astray?"

57\. Abraham said: "What then  
Is the business on which  
Ye (have come), O ye  
Messengers (of God)?"

58\. They said: "We have been  
Sent to a people  
(Deep) in sin,

59\. "Excepting the adherents  
Of Lūt: them we are certainly

<span id="page_648">p. 648</span>

(Charged) to save (from harm),—  
All—

60\. "Except his wife, who,  
We have ascertained,  
Will be among those  
Who will lag behind."

##### SECTION 5.

61\. At length when the messengers  
Arrived among the adherents  
Of Lūt,

62\. He said: "Ye appear  
To be uncommon folk."

63\. They said: "Yea,  
We have come to thee  
To accomplish that  
Of which they doubt.

64\. "We have brought to thee  
That which is inevitably  
Due, and assuredly  
We tell the truth.

65\. "Then travel by night  
With thy household,  
When a portion of the night  
(Yet remains), and do thou

<span id="page_649">p. 649</span>

Bring up the rear:  
Let no one amongst you  
Look back, but pass on  
Whither ye are ordered."

66\. And We made known  
This decree to him,  
That the last remnants  
Of those (sinners) should be  
Cut off by the morning.

67\. The inhabitants of the City  
Came in (mad) joy  
(At news of the young men).

68\. Lūt said: "These are  
My guests: disgrace me not:

69\. "But fear God,  
And shame me not."

70\. They said: "Did we not  
Forbid thee (to speak)  
For all and sundry?"

71\. He said: "There are  
My daughters (to marry),  
If ye must act (so)."

72\. Verily, by thy life (O Prophet),  
In their wild intoxication,

<span id="page_650">p. 650</span>

They wander in distraction,  
To and fro.

73\. But the (mighty) Blast  
Overtook them before morning;

74\. And We turned (the Cities)  
Upside down, and rained down  
On them brimstones  
Hard as baked clay.

75\. Behold! in this are Signs  
For those who by tokens  
Do understand.

76\. And the (Cities were)  
Right on the high-road.

77\. Behold! in this  
Is a Sign  
For those who believe!

78\. And the Companions of the Wood  
Were also wrong-doers;

<span id="page_651">p. 651</span>

79\. So We exacted retribution  
From them. They were both  
On an open highway,  
Plain to see.

##### SECTION 6.

80\. The Companions of the Rocky Tract  
Also rejected the apostles:

81\. We sent them Our Signs,  
But they persisted  
In turning away from them.

82\. Out of the mountains  
Did they hew (their) edifices,  
(Feeling themselves) secure.

83\. But the (mighty) Blast  
Seized them of a morning,

84\. And of no avail to them  
Was all that they did  
(With such art and care)!

85\. We created not the heavens,  
The earth, and all between them,

<span id="page_652">p. 652</span>

But for just ends.  
And the Hour is surely  
Coming (when this will be manifest).  
So overlook (any human faults)  
With gracious forgiveness.

86\. For verily it is thy Lord  
Who is the Master-Creator,  
Knowing all things.

87\. And We have bestowed  
Upon thee the Seven  
Oft-repeated (Verses)  
And the Grand Qur-ān.

88\. Strain not thine eyes.  
(Wistfully) at what We  
Have bestowed on certain classes  
Of them, nor grieve over them:

<span id="page_653">p. 653</span>

But lower thy wing  
(in gentleness)  
To the Believers.

89\. And say: "I am indeed he  
That warneth openly  
And without ambiguity,"—

90\. (Of just such wrath)  
As We sent down  
On those who divided  
(Scripture into arbitrary parts),—

91\. (So also on such)  
As have made Qur-ān  
Into shreds (as they please).

92\. Therefore, by the Lord,  
We will, of a surety,  
Call them to account,

93\. For all their deeds.

94\. Therefore expound openly  
What thou art commanded,  
And turn away from those  
Who join false gods with God.

95\. For sufficient are We  
Unto thee against those

<span id="page_654">p. 654</span>

Who scoff,—

96\. Those who adopt, with God,  
Another god: but soon  
Will they come to know.

97\. We do indeed know  
How thy heart is distressed  
At what they say.

98\. But celebrate the praises  
Of thy Lord, and be of those  
Who prostrate themselves  
In adoration.

99\. And serve thy Lord  
Until there come unto thee  
The Hour that is Certain.
