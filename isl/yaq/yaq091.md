### Sūra XCI.

### *Shams,* or The Sun.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. By the Sun  
And his (glorious) splendour;

2\. By the Moon  
As she follows him;

3\. By the Day as it  
Shows up (the Sun's) glory;

4\. By the Night as it  
Conceals it;

5\. By the Firmament  
And its (wonderful) structure;

<span id="page_1743">p. 1743</span>

6\. By the Earth  
And its (wide) expanse;

7\. By the Soul,  
And the proportion and order  
Given to it;

8\. And its enlightenment  
As to its wrong  
And its right;—

9\. Truly he succeeds  
That purifies it,

10\. And he fails  
That corrupts it!

11\. The <u>Th</u>amūd (people)  
Rejected (their prophet)  
Through their inordinate  
Wrong-doing.

12\. Behold, the most wicked  
Man among them was  
Deputed (for impiety).

13\. But the apostle of God  
Said to them: "It is

<span id="page_1744">p. 1744</span>

A She-camel of God!  
And (bar her not  
From) having her drink!"

14\. Then they rejected him  
(As a false prophet),  
And they hamstrung her.  
So their Lord, on account  
Of their crime, obliterated  
Their traces and made them  
Equal (in destruction,  
High and low)!

15\. And for Him  
Is no fear  
Of its consequences.
