### Sūra XXX.

### *Rūm*, or The Roman Empire.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. A. L. M.

2\. The Roman Empire  
Has been defeated—

3\. In a land close by;  
But they, (even) after  
(This) defeat of theirs,  
Will soon be victorious—

4\. Within a few years.  
With God is the Decision,  
In the Past  
And in the Future:  
On that Day shall  
The Believers rejoice—

<span id="page_1052">p. 1052</span>

5\. With the help of God.  
He helps whom He will,  
And He is Exalted in Might,  
Most Merciful.

6\. (It is) the promise of God.  
Never does God depart  
From His promise:  
But most men understand not.

7\. They know but the outer  
(Things) in the life  
Of this world: but  
Of the End of things  
They are heedless.

8\. Do they not reflect  
In their own minds?  
Not but for just ends  
And for a term appointed,  
Did God create the heavens  
And the earth, and all  
Between them: yet are there  
Truly many among men  
Who deny the meeting  
With their Lord  
(At the Resurrection)!

<span id="page_1053">p. 1053</span>

9\. Do they not travel  
Through the earth, and see  
What was the End  
Of those before them?  
They were superior to them  
In strength: they tilled  
The soil and populated it  
In greater numbers than these  
Have done: there came to them  
Their apostles with Clear (Signs),  
(Which they rejected, to their  
Own destruction): it was not  
God who wronged them, but  
They wronged their own souls.

10\. In the long run  
Evil in the extreme  
Will be the End of those  
Who do evil; for that  
They rejected the Signs  
Of God, and held them up  
To ridicule.

##### SECTION 2.

11\. It is God Who begins  
(The process of) creation;  
Then repeats it; then  
Shall ye be brought back  
To Him.

<span id="page_1054">p. 1054</span>

12\. On the Day that  
The Hour will be established,  
The guilty will be  
Struck dumb with despair.

13\. No intercessor will they have  
Among their "Partners",  
And they will (themselves)  
Reject their "Partners".

14\. On the Day that  
The Hour will he established,—  
That Day shall (all men)  
Be sorted out.

15\. Then those who have believed  
And worked righteous deeds,  
Shall be made happy  
In a Mead of Delight.

16\. And those who have rejected  
Faith and falsely denied  
Our Signs and the meeting  
Of the Hereafter,—such  
Shall be brought forth to  
Punishment.

17\. So (give) glory to God,  
When ye reach eventide

<span id="page_1055">p. 1055</span>

And when ye rise  
In the morning;

18\. Yea, To Him be praise,  
In the heavens and on earth;  
And in the late afternoon  
And when the day  
Begins to decline.

19\. It is He Who brings out  
The living from the dead,  
And brings out the dead  
From the living, and Who  
Gives life to the earth  
After it is dead:  
And thus shall ye be  
Brought out (from the dead).

##### SECTION 3.

20\. Among His Signs is this,  
That He created you

<span id="page_1056">p. 1056</span>

From dust; and then,—  
Behold, ye are men  
Scattered (far and wide)!

21\. And among His Signs  
Is this, that He created  
For you mates from among  
Yourselves, that ye may  
Dwell in tranquillity with them,  
And He has put love  
And mercy between your (hearts):  
Verily in that are Signs  
For those who reflect.

22\. And among His Signs  
Is the creation of the heavens  
And the earth, and the variations  
In your languages  
And your colours: verily  
In that are Signs  
For those who know.

23\. And among His Signs  
Is the sleep that ye take  
By night and by day,  
And the quest that ye

<span id="page_1057">p. 1057</span>

(Make for livelihood)  
Out of His Bounty: verily  
In that are Signs  
For those who hearken.

24\. And among His Signs,  
He shows you the lightning,  
By way both of fear  
And of hope, and He sends  
Down rain from the sky  
And with it gives life to  
The earth after it is dead:  
Verily in that are Signs  
For those who are wise.

25\. And among His Signs is this,  
That heaven and earth  
Stand by His Command:  
Then when He calls you,  
By a single call, from the earth,  
Behold, ye (straightway) come forth.

<span id="page_1058">p. 1058</span>

26\. To Him belongs every being  
That is in the heavens  
And on earth: all are  
Devoutly obedient to Him.

27\. It is He Who begins  
(The process of) creation;  
Then repeats it; and  
For Him it is most easy.  
To Him belongs the loftiest  
Similitude (we can think of)  
In the heavens and the earth:  
For He is Exalted in Might,  
Full of wisdom.

##### SECTION 4.

28\. He does propound  
To you a similitude  
From your own (experience):  
Do ye have partners  
Among those whom your right hands  
Possess, to share as equals  
In the wealth We have

<span id="page_1059">p. 1059</span>

Bestowed on you? Do ye  
Fear them as ye fear  
Each other? Thus do We  
Explain the Signs in detail  
To a people that understand.

29\. Nay, the wrong-doers (merely)  
Follow their own lusts,  
Being devoid of knowledge.  
But who will guide those  
Whom God leaves astray?  
To them there will be  
No helpers.

30\. So set thou thy face  
Steadily and truly to the Faith:  
(Establish) God's handiwork according  
To the pattern on which  
He has made mankind:  
No change (let there be)  
In the work (wrought)

<span id="page_1060">p. 1060</span>

By God: that is  
The standard Religion  
But most among mankind  
Understand not.

31\. Turn ye back in repentance  
To Him, and fear Him:  
Establish regular prayers,  
And be not ye among those  
Who join gods with God,—

32\. Those who split up  
Their Religion, and become  
(Mere) Sects,—each party  
Rejoicing in that which  
Is with itself!

33\. When trouble touches men,  
They cry to their Lord,  
Turning back to Him  
In repentance: but when  
He gives them a taste  
Of Mercy as from Himself,  
Behold, some of them  
Pay part-worship to  
Other god's besides their Lord,—

34\. (As if) to show their ingratitude  
For the (favours) We have  
Bestowed on them! Then enjoy  
(Your brief day); but soon

<span id="page_1061">p. 1061</span>

Will ye know (your folly).

35\. Or have We sent down  
Authority to them, which  
Points out to them  
The things to which  
They pay part-worship?

36\. When We give men  
A taste of Mercy,  
They exult thereat:  
And when-some evil  
Afflicts them because of  
What their (own) hands  
Have sent forth, behold,  
They are in despair!

37\. See they not that God  
Enlarges the provision and  
Restricts it, to whomsoever  
He pleases? Verily in that  
Are Signs for those who believe.

38\. So give what is due  
To kindred, the needy,  
And the wayfarer.  
That is best for those

<span id="page_1062">p. 1062</span>

Who seek the Countenance,  
Of God, and it is they  
Who will prosper.

39\. That which ye lay out  
For increase through the property  
Of (other) people, will have  
No increase with God:  
But that which ye lay out  
For charity, seeking  
The Countenance of God,  
(Will increase): it is  
These who twill get  
A recompense multiplied.

40\. It is God Who has  
Created you: further, He has  
Provided for your sustenance;  
Then He will cause you  
To die; and again He will  
Give you life. Are there  
Any of your (false) "Partners"  
Who can do any single  
One of these things?  
Glory to Him! and High  
Is He above the partners  
They attribute (to Him)!

<span id="page_1063">p. 1063</span>

##### SECTION 5.

41\. Mischief has appeared  
On land and sea because  
Of (the meed) that the hands  
Of men have earned,  
That (God) may give them  
A taste of some of their  
Deeds: in order that the  
May turn back (from Evil).

42\. Say: "Travel through the earth  
And see what was the End  
Of those before (you):  
Most of them worshipped  
Others besides God."

43\. But set thou thy face  
To the right Religion,  
Before there come from God  
The Day which there is

<span id="page_1064">p. 1064</span>

No chance of averting:  
On that Day shall men  
Be divided (in two).

44\. Those who reject Faith  
Will suffer from that rejection:  
And those who work righteousness  
Will spread their couch  
(Of repose) for themselves  
(In heaven):

45\. That He may reward those  
Who believe and work righteous  
Deeds, out of His Bounty.  
For He loves not those  
Who reject Faith.

46\. Among His Signs is this,  
That He sends the Winds,  
As heralds of Glad Tidings,  
Giving you a taste  
Of His (Grace and) Mercy,—  
That the ships may sail  
(Majestically) by His Command  
And that ye may seek

<span id="page_1065">p. 1065</span>

Of His Bounty: in order  
That ye may be grateful.

47\. We did indeed send,  
Before thee, apostles  
To their (respective) peoples,  
And they came to them  
With Clear Signs: then,  
To those who transgressed,  
We meted out Retribution:  
And it was due from us  
To aid those who believed.

48\. It is God Who sends  
The Winds, and they raise  
The Clouds: then does He  
Spread them in the sky  
As He wills, and break them  
Into fragments, until thou seest  
Rain-drops issue from the midst  
Thereof: then when He has  
Made them reach such  
His servants as He wills,  
Behold, they do rejoice!—

49\. Even though, before they received  
(The rain)—just before this—  
They were dumb with despair!

50\. Then contemplate (O man!)  
The memorials of God's Mercy!—  
How He gives life  
To the earth after  
Its death: verily the Same  
Will give life to the men

<span id="page_1066">p. 1066</span>

Who are dead: for He  
Has power over all things.

51\. And if We (but) send  
A Wind from which  
They see (their tilth)  
Turn yellow,—behold,  
They become, thereafter,  
Ungrateful (Unbelievers)!

52\. So verily thou canst not  
Make the dead to hear,  
Nor canst thou make  
The deaf to hear  
The call, when they show  
Their backs and turn away.

53\. Nor canst thou lead back  
The blind from their straying:  
Only those wilt thou make  
To hear, who believe  
In Our Signs and submit  
(Their wills in Islam).

##### SECTION 6.

54\. It is God Who  
Created you in a state  
Of (helpless) weakness, then  
Gave (you) strength after weakness,

<span id="page_1067">p. 1067</span>

Then, after strength, gave (you)  
Weakness and a hoary head:  
He creates as He wills,  
And it is He Who has  
All knowledge and power.

55\. On the Day that  
The Hour (of reckoning)  
Will be established,  
The transgressors will swear  
That they tarried not  
But an hour: thus were  
They used to being deluded!

56\. But those endued with knowledge  
And faith will say:  
"Indeed ye did tarry,  
Within God's Decree,  
To the Day of Resurrection,  
And this is the Day  
Of Resurrection: but ye—  
Ye were not aware!"

57\. So on that Day no excuse  
Of theirs will  
Avail the Transgressors,  
Nor will they be invited (then)  
To seek grace (by repentance).

<span id="page_1068">p. 1068</span>

58\. Verily We have propounded  
For men, in this Qur-ān.  
Every kind of Parable:  
But if thou bring to them  
Any Sign, the Unbelievers  
Are sure to say, "Ye  
Do nothing but talk vanities."

59\. Thus does God seal up  
The hearts of those  
Who understand not.

60\. So patiently persevere: for  
Verily the promise of God  
Is true: nor let those  
Shake thy firmness, who have  
(Themselves) no certainty of faith.
