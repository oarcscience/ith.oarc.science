### Sūra LXXI.

### *Nūḥ,* or Noah.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. We sent Noah  
To his People  
(With the Command):  
"Do thou warn thy People  
Before there comes to them  
A grievous Penalty."

2\. He said: "O my People!  
I am to you  
A Warner, clear and open:

3\. "That ye should worship  
God, fear Him,  
And obey me:

4\. "So He may forgive you  
Your sins and give you  
Respite for a stated Term:  
For when the Term given  
By God is accomplished,  
It cannot be put forward:  
If ye only knew."

5\. He, said: "O my Lord!  
I have called to my People  
Night and day:

<span id="page_1614">p. 1614</span>

6\. "But my call only  
Increases (their) flight  
(From the Right).

7\. "And every time I have  
Called to them, that Thou  
Mightest forgive them,  
They have (only) thrust  
Their fingers into their ears,  
Covered themselves up with  
Their garments, grown obstinate,  
And given themselves up  
To arrogance.

8\. "So I have called to them  
Aloud;

9\. "Further I have spoken  
To them in public  
And secretly in private,

10\. "Saying, "Ask forgiveness  
From your Lord;  
For He is Oft-Forgiving;

11\. "He will send rain  
To you in abundance;

<span id="page_1615">p. 1615</span>

12\. Give you increase  
In wealth and sons;  
And bestow on you  
Gardens and bestow on you  
Rivers (of flowing water).

13\. "What is the matter  
With you, that ye  
Place not your hope  
For kindness and long-suffering  
In God,—

14\. "Seeing that it is He  
That has created you  
In diverse stages?

15\. "See ye not  
How God has created  
The seven heavens  
One above another,

16\. "And made the moon  
A light in their midst,  
And made the sun  
As a (Glorious) Lamp?

17\. "And God has produced  
You from the earth,  
Growing (gradually),

<span id="page_1616">p. 1616</span>

18\. "And in the End  
He will return you  
Into the (earth),  
And raise you forth  
(Again at the Resurrection)?

19\. "And God has made  
The earth for you  
As a carpet (spread out),

20\. "That ye may go about  
Therein, in spacious roads."

##### SECTION 2.

21\. Noah said: "O my Lord!  
They have disobeyed me,  
But they follow (men)  
Whose wealth and children  
Give them no Increase  
But only Loss.

22\. "And they have devised  
A tremendous Plot.

23\. "And they have said  
(To each other),  
"Abandon not your gods:  
Abandon neither Wadd  
Nor Suwā‘, neither  
Yagūth nor Ya‘ūq,  
Nor Nasr’;—

24\. "They have already  
Misled many; and  
Grant Thou no increase  
To the wrong-doers but in  
Straying (from their mark)."

25\. Because of their sins  
They were drowned  
(In the flood),  
And were made to enter  
The Fire (of Punishment):  
And they found  
In lieu of God  
None to help them.

26\. And Noah said:  
"O my Lord! Leave not  
Of the Unbelievers,  
A single one on earth!

27\. "For, if Thou dost leave  
(Any of) them, they will  
But mislead Thy devotees,  
And they will breed none  
But wicked ungrateful ones.

28\. "O my Lord! Forgive me,  
My parents, all who  
Enter my house in Faith,  
And (all) believing men

<span id="page_1618">p. 1618</span>

And believing women:  
And to the wrong-doers  
Grant Thou no increase  
But in Perdition!"
