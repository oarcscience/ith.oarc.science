### Sūra XII.

### *Yūsuf,* or Joseph.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. A. L. R. These are  
The Symbols (or Verses)  
Of the Perspicuous Book.

2\. We have sent it down  
As an Arabic Qur-ān,  
In order that ye may  
Learn wisdom.

3\. We do relate unto thee  
The most beautiful of stories,  
In that We reveal to thee  
This (portion of the) Qur-ān:  
Before this, thou too  
Was among those  
Who knew it not.

4\. Behold, Joseph said  
To his father: "O my father!

<span id="page_551">p. 551</span>

I did see eleven stars  
And the sun and the moon:  
I saw them prostrate themselves  
To me!"

5\. Said (the father):  
"My (dear) little son!  
Relate not thy vision  
To thy brothers, lest they  
Concoct a plot against thee:  
For Satan is to man  
An avowed enemy!

6\. "Thus will thy Lord  
Choose thee and teach thee  
The interpretation of stories (and events)  
And perfect His favour  
To thee and to the posterity  
Of Jacob—even as He  
Perfected it to thy fathers  
Abraham and Isaac aforetime!  
For God is full of knowledge  
And wisdom."

##### SECTION 2.

7\. Verily in Joseph and his brethren  
Are Signs (or Symbols)

<span id="page_552">p. 552</span>

For Seekers (after Truth).

8\. They said: "Truly Joseph  
And his brother are loved  
More by our father than we:  
But we are a goodly body!  
Really our father is obviously  
Wandering (in his mind)!

9\. "Slay ye Joseph or cast him out  
To some (unknown) land,  
That so the favour  
Of your father may be  
Given to you alone:  
(There will be time enough)  
For you to be righteous after that!"

10\. Said one of them: "Slay not  
Joseph, but if ye must  
Do something, throw him down  
To the bottom of the well:  
He will be picked up  
By some caravan of travellers."

<span id="page_553">p. 553</span>

11\. They said: "O our father!  
Why dost thou not  
Trust us with Joseph,  
Seeing we are indeed  
His sincere well-wishers?

12\. "Send him with us tomorrow  
To enjoy himself and play,  
And we shall take  
Every care of him."

13\. (Jacob) said: "Really  
It saddens me that ye  
Should take him away:  
I fear lest the wolf  
Should devour him  
While ye attend not  
To him."

14\. They said: "If the wolf  
Were to devour him  
While we are (so large) a party,  
Then should we indeed  
(First) have perished ourselves!"

15\. So they did take him away,  
And they all agreed

<span id="page_554">p. 554</span>

To throw him down  
To the bottom of the well:  
And We put into his heart  
(This Message): "Of a surety  
Thou shalt (one day)  
Tell them the truth  
Of this their affair  
While they know (thee) not"

16\. Then they came  
To their father  
In the early part  
Of the night,  
Weeping.

17\. They said: "O our father!  
We went racing with one another,  
And left Joseph with our things;  
And the wolf devoured him.…  
But thou wilt never believe us  
Even though we tell the truth.

18\. They stained his shirt  
With false blood. He said:

<span id="page_555">p. 555</span>

"Nay, but your minds  
Have made up a tale  
(That may pass) with you.  
(For me) patience is most fitting:  
Against that which ye assert,  
It is God (alone)  
Whose help can be sought"…

19\. Then there came a caravan  
Of travellers: they sent  
Their water-carrier (for water),  
And he let down his bucket  
(Into the well)… He said:  
"Ah there! Good news!  
Here is a (fine) young man!"  
So they concealed him  
As a treasure! But God  
Knoweth well all that they do!

20\. The (Brethren) sold him  
For a miserable price,—

<span id="page_556">p. 556</span>

For a few dirhams counted out:  
In such low estimation  
Did they hold him!

##### SECTION 3.

21\. The man in Egypt  
Who bought him, said

<span id="page_557">p. 557</span>

To his wife: "Make his stay  
(Among us) honourable:  
Maybe he will bring us  
Much good, or we shall  
Adopt him as a son."  
Thus did We establish  
Joseph in the land,  
That We might teach him  
The interpretation of stories  
(And events). And God  
Hath full power and control  
Over His affairs; but most  
Among mankind know it not.

22\. When Joseph attained  
His full manhood, We gave him

<span id="page_558">p. 558</span>

Power and knowledge: thus do We  
Reward those who do right.

23\. But she in whose house  
He was, sought to seduce him  
From his (true) self: she fastened  
The doors, and said:  
"Now come, thou (dear one)!"  
He said: "God forbid!  
Truly (thy husband) is  
My lord! he made  
My sojourn agreeable!  
Truly to no good  
Come those who do wrong!"

24\. And (with passion) did she  
Desire him, and he would  
Have desired her, but that  
He saw the evidence  
Of his Lord: thus  
(Did We order) that We  
Might turn away from him  
(All) evil and shameful deeds:

<span id="page_559">p. 559</span>

For he was one of Our servants,  
Sincere and purified.

25\. So they both raced each other  
To the door, and she  
Tore his shirt from the back:  
They both found her lord  
Near the door. She said:  
"What is the (fitting) punishment  
For one who formed  
An evil design against  
Thy wife, but prison  
Or a grievous chastisement?"

26\. He said: "It was she  
That sought to seduce me—  
From my (true) self." And one  
Of her household saw (this)  
And bore witness, (thus):—  
"If it be that his shirt  
Is rent from the front, then  
Is her tale true,  
And he is a liar!

27\. "But if it be that his shirt  
Is torn from the back,

<span id="page_560">p. 560</span>

Then is she the liar,  
And he is telling the truth!"

28\. So when he saw his shirt,—  
That it was torn at the back,  
(Her husband) said: "Behold!  
It is a snare of you women!  
Truly, mighty is your snare!

29\. "O Joseph, pass this over!  
(O wife), ask forgiveness  
For thy sin, for truly  
Thou hast been at fault!"

##### SECTION 4.

30\. Ladies said in the City:  
"The wife of the (great) ’Aziz  
Is seeking to seduce her slave  
From his (true) self:  
Truly hath he inspired her  
With violent love: we see  
She is evidently going astray."

<span id="page_561">p. 561</span>

31\. When she heard  
Of their malicious talk,  
She sent for them  
And prepared a banquet  
For them: she gave  
Each of them a knife:  
And she said (to Joseph),  
"Come out before them."  
When they saw him,  
Thy did extol him,  
And (in their amazement)  
Cut their hands: they said,  
"God preserve us! no mortal  
Is this! This is none other  
Than a noble angel!"

32\. She said: "There before you  
Is the man about whom  
Ye did blame me!  
I did seek to seduce him from  
His (true) self but he did  
Firmly save himself guiltless!…  
And now, if he doth not  
My bidding, he shall certainly  
Be cast into prison,  
And (what is more)  
Be of the company of the vilest!"

<span id="page_562">p. 562</span>

33\. He said: "O my Lord!  
The prison is more  
To my liking than that  
To which they invite me:  
Unless Thou turn away  
Their snare from me,  
I should (in my youthful folly)  
Feel inclined towards them  
And join the ranks of the ignorant."

34\. So his Lord hearkened to him  
(In his prayer), and turned  
Away from him their snare:  
Verily He heareth and knoweth  
(All things).

35\. Then it occurred to the men,  
After they had seen the Signs,  
(That it was best)  
To Imprison him  
For a time.

<span id="page_563">p. 563</span>

##### SECTION 5.

36\. Now with him there came  
Into the prison two young men.  
Said one of them: "I see  
Myself (in a dream)  
Pressing wine." Said the other:  
"I see myself (in a dream)  
Carrying bread on my head,  
And birds are eating thereof."  
"Tell us" (they said) "the truth  
And meaning thereof: for we  
See thou art one  
That doth good (to all)."

37\. He said: "Before any food  
Comes (in due course)  
To feed either of you,  
I will surely reveal  
To you the truth  
And meaning of this  
Ere it befall you  
That is part of the (Duty)  
Which my Lord hath taught me.  
I have (I assure you)

<span id="page_564">p. 564</span>

Abandoned the ways  
Of a people that believe not  
In God and that (even)  
Deny the Hereafter.

38\. "And I follow the ways  
Of my fathers,—Abraham,  
Isaac, and Jacob; and never  
Could we attribute any partners  
Whatever to God: that (comes)  
Of the grace of God to us  
And to mankind: yet  
Most men are not grateful

39\. "O my two companions.  
Of the prison! (I ask you):  
Are many lords differing  
Among themselves better,  
Or the One God,  
Supreme and Irresistible?

40\. "If not Him, ye worship nothing  
But names which ye have named,—  
Ye and your fathers,—  
For which God hath sent down  
No authority: the Command  
Is for none but God: He

<span id="page_565">p. 565</span>

Hath commanded that ye worship  
None but Him: that is  
The right religion, but  
Most men understand not…

41\. "O my two companions  
Of the prison! As to one  
Of you, he will pour out  
The wine for his lord to drink:  
As for the other, he will  
Hang from the cross, and the birds  
Will eat from off his head.  
(So) hath been decreed  
That matter whereof  
Ye twain do enquire"…

42\. And of the two,  
To that one whom he considered  
About to be saved, he said:  
"Mention me to thy lord."

<span id="page_566">p. 566</span>

But Satan made him forget  
To mention him to his lord:  
And (Joseph) lingered in prison  
A few (more) years.

##### SECTION 6.

43\. The king (of Egypt) said:  
"I do see (in a vision)  
Seven fat kine, whom seven  
Lean ones devour,—and seven  
Green ears of corn, and seven (others)  
Withered. O ye chiefs!  
Expound to me my vision  
If it be that ye can  
Interpret visions."

<span id="page_567">p. 567</span>

44\. They said: "A confused medley  
Of dreams: and we are not  
Skilled in the interpretation  
Of dreams."

45\. But the man who had been  
Released, one of the two  
(Who had been in prison)  
And who now bethought him  
After (so long) a space of time,  
Said: "I will tell you  
The truth of its interpretation:  
Send ye me (therefor)."

46."O Joseph!" (he said).  
"O man of truth! Expound  
To us (the dream)  
Of seven fat kine  
Whom seven lean ones  
Devour, and of seven  
Green ears of corn  
And (seven) others withered:  
That I may return  
To the people, and that  
They may understand."

47\. (Joseph) said: "For seven years  
Shall ye diligently sow

<span id="page_568">p. 568</span>

As is your wont:  
And the harvests that ye reap,  
Ye shall leave them in the ear,—  
Except a little, of which  
Ye shall eat.

48\. "Then will come  
After that (period)  
Seven dreadful (years),  
Which will devour  
What ye shall have laid by  
In advance for them,—  
(All) except a little  
Which ye shall have  
(Specially) guarded.

49\. "Then will come  
After that (period) a year  
In which the people will have  
Abundant water, and in which  
They will press (wine and oil)."

<span id="page_569">p. 569</span>

##### SECTION 7.

50\. So the king said:  
"Bring ye him unto me."  
But when the messenger  
Came to him, (Joseph) said:  
"Go thou back to thy lord,  
And ask him, "What is  
The state of mind  
Of the ladies  
Who cut their hands?"  
For my Lord is  
Certainly well aware  
Of their snare."

51\. (The king) said (to the ladies):  
"What was your affair  
When ye did seek to seduce  
Joseph from his (true) self?"  
The ladies said: "God  
Preserve us! no evil

<span id="page_570">p. 570</span>

Know we against him!"  
Said the ’Azīz's wife:  
"Now is the truth manifest  
(To all): it was I  
Who sought to seduce him  
From his (true) self:  
He is indeed of those  
Who are (ever) true (and virtuous).

52\. "This (say I), in order that  
He may know that I  
Have never been false  
To him in his absence,  
And that God will never  
Guide the snare of the false ones.

<span id="page_571">p. 571</span>

53\. "Nor do I absolve my own self  
(Of blame): the (human) soul  
Is certainly prone to evil,  
Unless my Lord do bestow  
His Mercy: but surely  
My Lord is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful."

54\. So the king said:  
"Bring him unto me;  
I will take him specially  
To serve about my own person."  
Therefore when he had spoken  
To him, he said:  
"Be assured this day,  
Thou art, before our own Presence,  
With rank firmly established,  
And fidelity fully proved!

55\. (Joseph) said: "Set me  
Over the store-houses  
Of the land: I will  
Indeed guard them,

<span id="page_572">p. 572</span>

As one that knows  
(Their importance)."

56\. "Thus did we give  
Established power to Joseph  
In the land, to take possession  
Therein as, when, or where  
He pleased. We bestow  
Of Our mercy on whom  
We please, and We suffer not,  
To be lost, the reward  
Of those who do good.

57\. But verily the reward  
Of the Hereafter  
Is the best, for those  
Who believe, and are constant  
In righteousness.

##### SECTION 8.

58\. Then came Joseph's brethren:  
They entered his presence,  
And he knew them,  
But they knew him not.

<span id="page_573">p. 573</span>

59\. And when he had furnished  
Them forth with provisions  
(Suitable) for them, he said:  
"Bring unto me a brother  
Ye have, of the same father  
As yourselves, (but a different mother):  
See ye not that I pay out  
Full measure, and that I  
Do provide the best hospitality?

60\. "Now if ye bring him not  
To me, ye shall have  
No measure (of corn) from me,  
Nor shall ye (even) come  
Near me."

61\. They said: "We shall  
Certainly seek to get  
Our wish about him  
From his father:  
Indeed we shall do it."

62\. And (Joseph) told his servants  
To put their stock-in-trade  
(With which they had bartered)  
Into their saddle-bags,  
So they should know it only  
When they returned to their people,

<span id="page_574">p. 574</span>

In order that they  
Might come back.

63\. Now when they returned  
To their father, they said:  
"O our father! No more  
Measure of grain shall we get  
(Unless we take our brother):  
So send our brother with us,  
That we may get our measure;  
And we will indeed  
Take every care of him."

64\. He said: "Shall I trust you  
With him with any result  
Other than when I trusted you  
With his brother aforetime?  
But God is the best  
To take care (of him),  
And He is the Most Merciful  
Of those who show mercy!"

65\. Then when they opened  
Their baggage, they found  
Their stock-in-trade had been  
Returned to them. They said:  
"O our father! What (more)  
Can we desire? This our  
Stock-in-trade has been returned  
To us: so we shall get

<span id="page_575">p. 575</span>

(More) food for our family;  
We shall take care of our brother;  
And add (at the same time)  
A full camel's load (of grain  
To our provisions).  
This is but a small quantity.

66\. (Jacob) said: "Never will I  
Send him with you until  
Ye swear a solemn oath to me,  
In God's name, that ye  
Will be sure to bring him back  
To me unless ye are yourselves  
Hemmed in (and made powerless)."  
And when they had sworn  
Their solemn oath,  
He said: "Over all  
That we say, be God  
The Witness and Guardian!"

67\. Further he said:  
"O my sons! enter not  
All by one gate: enter ye  
By different gates. Not that

<span id="page_576">p. 576</span>

I can profit you aught  
Against God (with my advice):  
None can command except God:  
On Him do I put my trust:  
And let all that trust  
Put their trust on Him."

68\. And when they entered  
In the manner their father  
Had enjoined, it did not  
Profit them in the least  
Against (the Plan of) God:  
It was but a necessity  
Of Jacob's soul, which he  
Discharged. For he was,  
By Our instruction, full  
Of knowledge (and experience):  
But most men know not.

<span id="page_577">p. 577</span>

##### SECTION 9.

69\. Now when they came  
Into Joseph's presence,  
He received his (full) brother  
To stay with him. He said  
(To him): "Behold! I am thy (own)  
Brother; so grieve not  
At aught of their doings."

70\. At length when he had furnished  
Them forth with provisions  
(Suitable) for them, he put  
The drinking cup into  
His brother's saddle-bag.  
Then shouted out a Crier:  
"O ye (in) the Caravan!  
Behold! ye are thieves,  
Without doubt!"

71\. They said, turning towards them:  
"What is it that ye miss?"

72\. They said: "We miss  
The great beaker of the king;

<span id="page_578">p. 578</span>

For him who produces it,—  
Is (the reward of)  
A camel load; I  
Will be bound by it."

73\. (The brothers) said: "By God!  
Well ye know that we  
Came not to make mischief  
In the land, and we are  
No thieves!"

74\. (The Egyptians) said: "What then  
Shall be the penalty of this,  
If ye are (proved) to have lied?"

75\. They said: "The penalty  
Should be that he  
In whose saddle-bag  
It is found, should be held  
(As bondman) to atone  
For the (crime). Thus it is  
We punish the wrong-doers!"

76\. So he began (the search)  
With their baggage,

<span id="page_579">p. 579</span>

Before (he came to) the baggage  
Of his brother: at length  
He brought it out of his  
Brother's baggage. Thus did We  
Plan for Joseph. He could not  
Take his brother by the law  
Of the king except that God  
Willed it (so). We raise  
To degrees (of wisdom) whom  
We please: but over all  
Endued with knowledge is One,  
The All-Knowing.

77\. They said: "If he steals,  
There was a brother of his  
Who did steal before (him)."  
But these things did Joseph  
Keep locked in his heart,  
Revealing not the secrets to them.

<span id="page_580">p. 580</span>

He (simply) said (to himself):  
"Ye are the worse situated;  
And God knoweth best  
The truth of what ye assert!"

78\. They said: "O exalted one!  
Behold! he has a father,  
Aged and venerable, (who will  
Grieve for him); so take  
One of us in his place;  
For we see that thou art  
(Gracious) in doing good."

79\. He said: "God forbid  
That we take other than him  
With whom we found  
Our property: indeed  
(If we did so), we should  
Be acting wrongfully.

##### SECTION 10.

80\. Now when they saw  
No hope of his (yielding),  
They held a conference in private.  
The leader among them said:  
"Know ye not that your father  
Did take an oath from you  
In God's name, and how,  
Before this, ye did fail

<span id="page_581">p. 581</span>

In your duty with Joseph?  
Therefore will I not leave  
This land until my father  
Permits me, or God  
Commands me; and He  
Is the best to command.

81\. "Turn ye back to your father,  
And say, "O our father!  
Behold! thy son committed theft!  
We bear witness only to what  
We know, and we could not  
Well guard against the unseen!

82\. "Ask at the town where  
We have been and the caravan  
In which we returned,  
And (you will find) we are  
Indeed telling the truth."

83\. Jacob said: "Nay, but ye  
Have yourselves contrived  
A story (good enough) for you.  
So patience is most fitting  
(For me). Maybe God will  
Bring them (back) all  
To me (in the end).  
For He is indeed full  
Of knowledge and wisdom.

<span id="page_582">p. 582</span>

84\. And he turned away from them,  
And said: "How great  
Is my grief for Joseph!"  
And his eyes became white  
With sorrow, and he fell  
Into silent melancholy.

85\. They said: "By God!  
(Never) wilt thou cease  
To remember Joseph  
Until thou reach the last  
Extremity of illness,  
Or until thou die!"

86\. He said: "I only complain  
Of my distraction and anguish  
To God, and I know from God  
That which ye know not…

87\. "O my sons! go ye  
And enquire about Joseph  
And his brother, and never  
Give up hope of God's  
Soothing Mercy: truly  
No one despairs of God's

<span id="page_583">p. 583</span>

Soothing Mercy, except  
Those who have no faith."

88\. Then, when they came  
(Back) into (Joseph's) presence  
They said: "O exalted one!  
Distress has seized us  
And our family: we have  
(Now) brought but scanty capital:  
So pay us full measure,  
(We pray thee), and treat it  
As charity to us: for God  
Doth reward the charitable."

89\. He said: "Know ye  
How ye dealt with Joseph  
And his brother, not knowing  
(What ye were doing)?"

90\. They said: "Art thou indeed  
Joseph?" He said . "I am  
Joseph, and this is my brother:  
God has indeed been gracious

<span id="page_584">p. 584</span>

To us (all): behold, he that is  
Righteous and patient,—never  
Will God suffer the reward  
To be lost, of those  
Who do right."

91\. They said: "By God! Indeed  
Has God preferred thee  
Above us, and we certainly  
Have been guilty of sin!"

92\. He said: "This day  
Let no reproach be (cast)  
On you; God will forgive you,  
And He is the Most Merciful  
Of those who show mercy!

93\. "Go with this my shirt,  
And cast it over the face  
Of my father: he will  
Come to see (clearly). Then come  
Ye (here) to me together  
With all your family."

##### SECTION 11.

94\. When the Caravan left (Egypt),  
Their father said: "I do indeed  
Scent the presence of Joseph:  
Nay, think me not a dotard."

95\. They said: "By God!  
Truly thou art in  
Thine old wandering mind."

96\. Then when the bearer  
Of the good news came,  
He cast (the shirt)  
Over his face, and he  
Forthwith regained clear sight.  
He said: "Did I not say  
To you, "I know from God  
That which ye know not?"

<span id="page_586">p. 586</span>

97\. They said: "O our father!  
Ask for us forgiveness  
For our sins, for we  
Were truly at fault."

98\. He said: "Soon will I  
Ask my Lord for forgiveness  
For you: for He is indeed  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

99\. Then when they entered  
The presence of Joseph,  
He provided a home  
For his parents with himself,  
And said: "Enter ye  
Egypt (all) in safety  
If it please God."

100\. And he raised his parents  
High on the throne (of dignity),  
And they fell down in prostration,  
(All) before him. He said:  
"O my father! this is  
The fulfilment of my vision  
Of old! God hath made it  
Come true! He was indeed  
Good to me when He  
Took me out of prison

<span id="page_587">p. 587</span>

And brought you (all here)  
Out of the desert,  
(Even) after Satan had sown  
Enmity between me and my brothers.  
Verily my Lord understandeth  
Best the mysteries of all  
that He planneth to do.  
For verily He is full  
Of knowledge and wisdom.

101."O my Lord! Thou hast  
Indeed bestowed on me  
Some power, and taught me  
Something of the interpretation  
Of dreams and events,—O Thou  
Creator of the heavens  
And the earth! Thou art  
My Protector in this world  
And in the Hereafter.  
Take Thou my soul (at death)  
As one submitting to Thy Will  
(As a Muslim), and unite me  
With the righteous."

<span id="page_588">p. 588</span>

102\. Such is one of the stories  
Of what happened unseen,  
Which We reveal by inspiration  
Unto thee: nor wast thou  
(Present) with them when they  
Concerted their plans together  
In the process of weaving their plots.

103\. Yet no faith will  
The greater part of mankind  
Have, however ardently  
Thou dost desire it.

104\. And no reward dost thou ask  
Of them for this: it is  
No less than a Message  
For all creatures.

##### SECTION 12.

105\. And how many Signs  
In the heavens and the earth

<span id="page_589">p. 589</span>

Do they pass by? Yet they  
Turn (their faces) away from them!

106\. And most of them  
Believe not in God  
Without associating (others  
As partners) with Him!

107\. Do they then feel secure  
From the coming against them  
Of the covering veil  
Of the wrath of God,  
Or of the coming against them  
Of the (final) Hour  
All of a sudden  
While they perceive not?

108\. Say thou: "This is my Way:  
I do invite unto God,  
On evidence clear as  
The seeing with one's eyes,—

<span id="page_590">p. 590</span>

I and whoever follows me.  
Glory to God! and never  
Will I join gods with God!"

109\. Nor did We send before thee  
(As apostles) any but men,  
Whom We did inspire,—  
(Men) living in human habitations.  
Do they not travel  
Through the earth, and see  
What was the end  
Of those before them?  
But the home of the Hereafter  
Is best, for those who do right.  
Will ye not then understand?

110\. (Respite will be granted)  
Until, when the apostles  
Give up hope (of their people)  
And (come to) think that they  
Were treated as liars,  
There reaches them Our help,  
And those whom We will  
Are delivered into safety.  
But never will be warded off  
Our punishment from those  
Who are in sin.

111\. There is, in their stories,  
Instruction for men endued

<span id="page_591">p. 591</span>

With understanding. It is not  
A tale invented, but a confirmation  
Of what went before it,—  
A detailed exposition  
Of all things, and a Guide  
And a Mercy to any such  
As believe.
