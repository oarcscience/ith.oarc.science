### Sūra LXVIII.

### *Qalam,* or the Pen, or *Nūn*.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Nūn.* By the Pen  
And by the (Record)  
Which (men) write,—

2\. Thou art not,  
By the grace of thy Lord,  
Mad or possessed.

3\. Nay, verily for thee  
Is a Reward unfailing:

4\. And thou (standest)  
On an exalted standard  
Of character.

<span id="page_1586">p. 1586</span>

5\. Soon wilt thou see,  
And they will see,

6\. Which of you is  
Afflicted with madness.

7\. Verily it is thy Lord  
That knoweth best,  
Which (among men)  
Hath strayed from His Path:  
And He knoweth best  
Those who receive  
(True) Guidance.

8\. So hearken not  
To those who  
Deny (the Truth),

9\. Their desire is that  
Thou shouldst be pliant:  
So would they be pliant.

10\. Heed not the type  
Of despicable man,—  
Ready with oaths,

<span id="page_1587">p. 1587</span>

11\. A slanderer, going about  
With calumnies,

12\. (Habitually) hindering (all) good,  
Transgressing beyond bounds,  
Deep in sin,

13\. Violent (and cruel),—  
With all that, base-born,—

14\. Because he possesses  
Wealth and (numerous) sons.

15\. When to him are rehearsed  
Our Signs,  
"Tales of the Ancients",  
He cries!

16\. Soon shall We brand  
(The beast) on the snout!

17\. Verily We have tried them  
As We tried the People

<span id="page_1588">p. 1588</span>

Of the Garden,  
When they resolved to gather  
The fruits of the (garden)  
In the morning,

18\. But made no reservation,  
("If it be God's Will").

19\. Then there came  
On the (garden)  
A visitation from thy Lord,  
(Which swept away) all around,  
While they were asleep.

20\. So the (garden) became,  
By the morning, like  
A dark and desolate spot,  
(Whose fruit had been gathered).

21\. As the morning broke,  
They called out,  
One to another,—

22\. "Go ye to your tilth  
(Betimes) in the morning,

<span id="page_1589">p. 1589</span>

If ye would gather  
The fruits."

23\. So they departed, conversing  
In secret low tones, (saying)—

24\. "Let not a single indigent  
Person break in upon you  
Into the (garden) this day."

25\. And they opened the morning,  
Strong in an (unjust) resolve.

26\. But when they saw  
The (garden), they said:  
"We have surely lost our way:

27\. "Indeed we are shut out  
(Of the fruits of our labour)!"

28\. Said one of them,  
More just (than the rest):  
"Did I not say to you,  
"Why not glorify (God)?"

29\. They said: "Glory  
To our Lord! Verily we  
Have been doing wrong!"

<span id="page_1590">p. 1590</span>

30\. Then they turned, one  
Against another, in reproach.

31\. They said: "Alas for us!  
We have indeed transgressed!

32\. "It may be that our Lord  
Will give us in exchange  
A better (garden) than this:  
For we do turn to Him  
(In repentance)!"

33\. Such is the Punishment  
(In this life); but greater  
Is the Punishment  
In the Hereafter,—  
If only they knew!

<span id="page_1591">p. 1591</span>

##### SECTION 2.

34\. Verily, for the Righteous,  
Are Gardens of Delight,  
In the Presence  
Of their Lord.

35\. Shall We then treat  
The People of Faith  
Like the People of Sin?

36\. What is the matter  
With you? How judge ye?

37\. Or have ye a Book  
Through which ye learn—

38\. That ye shall have,  
Through it whatever  
Ye choose?

39\. Or have ye Covenants  
With Us on oath,  
Reaching to the Day  
Of Judgment, (providing)  
That ye shall have  
Whatever ye shall demand?

<span id="page_1592">p. 1592</span>

40\. Ask thou of them,  
Which of them will stand  
Surety for that!

41\. Or have they some  
"Partners" (in Godhead)?  
Then let them produce  
Their "partners",  
If they are truthful!

42\. The Day that the Shin  
Shall be laid bare,  
And they shall be summoned  
To bow in adoration,  
But they shall not be able,—

43\. Their eyes will be  
Cast down,—ignominy will  
Cover them; seeing that  
They had been summoned  
Aforetime to bow in adoration,  
While they were whole,  
(And had refused).

44\. Then leave Me alone  
With such as reject  
This Message: by degrees  
Shall We punish them

<span id="page_1593">p. 1593</span>

From directions they perceive not.

45\. A (long) respite will I  
Grant them: truly  
Powerful is My Plan.

46\. Or is it that thou dost  
Ask them for a reward,  
So that they are burdened  
With a load of debt?—

47\. Or that the Unseen  
Is in their hands, so that  
They can write it down?

48\. So wait with patience  
For the Command  
Of thy Lord, and be not  
Like the Companion  
Of the Fish,—when he  
Cried out in agony.

49\. Had not Grace  
From His Lord  
Reached him, he  
Would indeed have been

<span id="page_1594">p. 1594</span>

Cast off on the naked  
Shore, in disgrace.

50\. Thus did his Lord  
Choose him and make him  
Of the company  
Of the Righteous.

51\. And the Unbelievers  
Would almost trip thee up  
With their eyes when they  
Hear the Message; and they  
Say: "Surely he is possessed!"

52\. But it is nothing less  
Than a Message  
To all the worlds.
