### Sūra XXI.

### *Anbiyāa,* or The Prophets

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Closer and closer to mankind  
Comes their Reckoning: yet they  
Heed not and they turn away.

2\. Never comes (aught) to them  
Of a renewed Message  
From their Lord, but they  
Listen to it as in jest,—

3\. Their hearts toying as with  
Trifles. The wrong-doers conceal  
Their private counsels, (saying),  
"Is this (one) more than  
A man like yourselves?  
Will ye go to witchcraft  
With your eyes open?"

4\. Say: "My Lord  
Knoweth (every) word (spoken)  
In the heavens and on earth:  
He is the One that heareth  
And knoweth (all things)."

<span id="page_823">p. 823</span>

5\. "Nay," they say, "(these are)  
Medleys of dreams!—Nay,  
He forged it!—Nay,  
He is (but) a poet!  
Let him then bring us  
A Sign like the ones  
That were sent to  
(Prophets) of old!"

6\. (As to those) before them,  
Not one of the populations  
Which We destroyed believed:  
Will these believe?

7\. Before thee, also, the apostles  
We sent were but men,  
To whom We granted inspiration:  
If ye realise this not, ask  
Of those who possess the Message.

8\. Nor did We give them  
Bodies that ate no food,  
Nor were they exempt from death.

9\. In the end We fulfilled  
To them Our promise,  
And We saved them  
And those whom We pleased,

<span id="page_824">p. 824</span>

But We destroyed those  
Who transgressed beyond bounds.

10\. We have revealed for you  
(O men!) a book in which  
Is a Message for you:  
Will ye not then understand?

##### SECTION 2.

11\. How many were the populations  
We utterly destroyed because  
Of their iniquities, setting up  
In their places other peoples?

12\. Yet, when they felt  
Our Punishment (coming),  
Behold, they (tried to) flee  
From it.

13\. Flee not, but return to  
The good things of this life  
Which were given you,  
And to your homes,  
In order that ye may  
Be called to account

14\. They said: "Ah! woe to us!  
We were indeed wrong-doers!"

15\. And that cry of theirs  
Ceased not, till we made

<span id="page_825">p. 825</span>

Them as a field  
That is mown, as ashes  
Silent and quenched.

16\. Not for (idle) sport did We  
Create the heavens and the earth  
And all that is between!

17\. If it had been Our wish  
To take (just) a pastime,  
We should surely have taken  
It from the things nearest  
To Us, if We would  
Do (such a thing)!

18\. Nay, We hurl the Truth  
Against falsehood, and it knocks  
Out its brain, and behold,  
Falsehood doth perish!  
Ah! woe be to you  
For the (false) things  
Ye ascribe (to Us).

19\. To Him belong all (creatures)  
In the heavens and on earth:  
Even those who are in His  
(Very) Presence are not  
Too proud to serve Him,  
Nor are they (ever) weary  
(Of His service):

20\. They celebrate His praises  
Night and day, nor do they  
Ever flag or intermit.

<span id="page_826">p. 826</span>

21\. Or have they taken  
(For worship) gods from the earth  
Who can raise (the dead)?

22\. If there were, in the heavens  
And the earth, other gods  
Besides God, there would  
Have been confusion in both!  
But glory to God,  
The Lord of the Throne:  
(High is He) above  
What they attribute to Him!

23\. He cannot be questioned  
For His acts, but they  
Will be questioned (for theirs).

24\. Or have they taken  
For worship (other) gods  
Besides him? Say, "Bring  
Your convincing proof: this  
Is the Message of those  
With me and the Message  
Of those before me."  
But most of them know not  
The Truth, and so turn away.

<span id="page_827">p. 827</span>

25\. Not an apostle did We  
Send before thee without  
This inspiration sent by Us  
To him: that there is  
No god but I; therefore  
Worship and serve Me.

26\. And they say: "(God)  
Most Gracious has begotten  
Offspring." Glory to Him!  
They are (but) servants raised  
To honour.

27\. They speak not before  
He speaks, and they act  
(In all things) by His command.

28\. He knows what is before them,  
And what is behind them,  
And they offer no intercession  
Except for those who are  
Acceptable, and they stand  
In awe and reverence  
Of His (glory).

29\. If any of them should say,  
"I am a god besides Him",  
Such a one We should  
Reward with Hell: thus  
Do We reward those  
Who do wrong.

<span id="page_828">p. 828</span>

##### SECTION 3.

30\. Do not the Unbelievers see  
That the heavens and the earth  
Were joined together (as one  
Unit of Creation), before  
We clove them asunder?  
We made from water  
Every living thing. Will they  
Not then believe?

31\. And We have set on the earth  
Mountains standing firm,

<span id="page_829">p. 829</span>

Lest it should shake with them,  
And We have made therein  
Broad highways  
(between mountains)  
For them to pass through:  
That they may receive guidance.

32\. And We have made  
The heavens as a canopy  
Well guarded: yet do they  
Turn away from the Signs  
Which these things (point to)!

33\. It is He Who created  
The Night and the Day,  
And the sun and the moon:  
All (the celestial bodies)  
Swim along, each in its  
Rounded course.

34\. We granted not to any man  
Before thee permanent life  
(Here): If then thou shouldst die,  
Would they live permanently?

35\. Every soul shall have  
A taste of death:  
And We test you  
By evil and by good

<span id="page_830">p. 830</span>

By way of trial.  
To Us must ye return.

36\. When the Unbelievers see thee,  
They treat thee not except  
With ridicule. "Is this,"  
(They say), "the one who talks  
Of your gods?" And they  
Blaspheme at the mention  
Of (God) Most Gracious!

37\. Man is a creature of haste:  
Soon (enough) will I show  
You My Signs; then  
Ye will not ask Me  
To hasten them!

38\. They say: "When will this  
Promise come to pass,  
If ye are telling the truth?"

39\. If only the Unbelievers  
Knew (the time) when they  
Will not be able  
To ward off the Fire  
From their faces, nor yet  
From their backs, and (when)  
No help can reach them!

40\. Nay, it may come to them  
All of a sudden and confound  
Them: no power will they  
Have then to avert it,  
Nor will they (then)  
Get respite.

<span id="page_831">p. 831</span>

41\. Mocked were (many)  
Apostles before thee;  
But their scoffers  
Were hemmed in  
By the thing that they mocked.

##### SECTION 4.

42\. Say, "Who can keep  
You safe by night and by day  
From (the Wrath of) (God)  
Most Gracious?" Yet they  
Turn away from the mention  
Of their Lord.

43\. Or have they gods that  
Can guard them from Us?  
They have no power to aid  
Themselves, nor can they  
Be defended from Us.

44\. Nay, We gave the good things  
Of this life to these men  
And their fathers until  
The period grew long for them;  
See they not that We  
Gradually reduce the land  
(In their control) from  
Its outlying borders? Is it  
Then they who will win?

<span id="page_832">p. 832</span>

45\. Say, "I do but warn you  
According to revelation":  
But the deaf will not hear  
The call, (even) when  
They are warned!

46\. If but a breath of the Wrath  
Of thy Lord do touch them,  
They will then say, "Woe  
To us! we did wrong indeed!"

47\. We shall set up scales  
Of justice for the day  
Of Judgment, so that  
Not a soul will be dealt with  
Unjustly in the least.  
And if there be  
(No more than) the weight  
Of a mustard seed,  
We will bring it (to account):  
And enough are We  
To take account.

48\. In the past We granted  
To Moses and Aaron

<span id="page_833">p. 833</span>

The Criterion (for judgment),  
And a Light and a Message  
For those who would do right,—

49\. Those who fear their Lord  
In their most secret thoughts,  
And who hold the Hour  
(Of Judgment) in awe.

50\. And this is a blessed  
Message which We have  
Sent down: will ye then  
Reject it?

<span id="page_834">p. 834</span>

51\. We bestowed aforetime  
On Abraham his rectitude  
Of conduct, and well were we  
Acquainted with him.

52\. Behold! he said  
To his father and his people  
"What are these images,  
To which ye are  
(So assiduously) devoted?"

53\. They said, "We found  
Our fathers worshipping them."

54\. He said, "Indeed ye  
Have been made in manifest  
Error—ye and your fathers."

55\. They said, "Have you  
Brought us the Truth,  
Or are you one  
Of those who jest?"

56\. He said, "Nay, your Lord  
Is the Lord of the heavens  
And the earth, He Who  
Created them (from nothing):  
And I am a witness  
To this (truth).

<span id="page_835">p. 835</span>

57\. "And by god, I have  
A plan for your idols—  
After ye go away  
And turn your backs"…

58\. So he broke them to pieces,  
(All) but the biggest of them,  
That they might turn  
(And address themselves) to it.

59\. They said, "Who has  
Done this to our gods?  
He must indeed be  
Some man of impiety!"

60\. They said, "We heard  
A youth talk of them:  
He is called Abraham."

61\. They said, "Then bring him  
Before the eyes of the people,  
That they may bear witness:"

62\. They said, "Art thou  
The one that did this  
With our gods, O Abraham?"

<span id="page_836">p. 836</span>

63\. He said: "Nay, this  
Was done by —  
This is their biggest one!  
Ask them, if they  
Can speak intelligently!"

64\. So they turned to themselves  
And said, "Surely ye  
Are the ones in the wrong!

65\. Then were they confounded  
With shame: (they said),  
"Thou knowest full well that  
These (idols) do not speak!"

66\. (Abraham) said, "Do ye then  
Worship, besides God,  
Things that can neither  
Be of any good to you  
Nor do you harm?

67\. "Fie upon you, and upon  
The things that ye worship  
Besides God! Have ye  
No sense?"…

68\. They said, "Burn him  
And protect your gods,  
If ye do (anything at all)!"

<span id="page_837">p. 837</span>

69\. We said, "O Fire!  
Be thou cool,  
And (a means of) safety  
For Abraham!"

70\. Then they sought a stratagem  
Against him: but We  
Made them the ones  
That lost most!

71\. But We delivered him  
And (his nephew) Lūt  
(And directed them) to the land  
Which We have blessed  
For the nations.

72\. And We bestowed on him Isaac

<span id="page_838">p. 838</span>

And, as an additional gift,  
(A grandson), Jacob, and We  
Made righteous men of every one  
(Of them).

73\. And We made them  
Leaders, guiding (men) by  
Our Command, and We  
Sent them inspiration  
To do good deeds,  
To establish regular prayers,  
And to practise regular charity;  
And they constantly served  
Us (and Us only).

74\. And to Lūt, too,  
We gave Judgment and Knowledge,  
And We saved him  
From the town which practised  
Abominations: truly they were  
A people given to Evil,  
A rebellious people.

75\. And We admitted him  
To Our Mercy: for he  
Was one of the Righteous.

##### SECTION 6.

76\. (Remember) Noah, when  
He cried (to Us) aforetime:  
We listened to his (prayer)  
And delivered him and his  
Family from great distress.

<span id="page_839">p. 839</span>

77\. We helped him against  
People who rejected Our Signs:  
Truly they were a people  
Given to Evil: so We  
Drowned them (in the Flood)  
All together.

78\. And remember David  
And Solomon, when they  
Gave judgment in the matter  
Of the field into which  
The sheep of certain people  
Had strayed by night:  
We did witness their judgment.

79\. To Solomon We inspired  
The (right) understanding  
Of the matter: to each  
(Of them) We gave Judgment  
And Knowledge; it was  
Our power that made  
The hills and the birds  
Celebrate Our praises,  
With David: it was We  
Who did (all these things).

80\. It was We Who taught him  
The making of coats of mail

<span id="page_840">p. 840</span>

For your benefit, to guard  
You from each other's violence:  
Will ye then be grateful?

81\. (It was Our power that  
Made) the violent (unruly)  
Wind flow (tamely) for Solomon,  
To his order, to the land  
Which We had blessed:  
For We do know all things.

82\. And of the evil ones,  
Were some who dived  
For him, and did other work  
Besides; and it was We  
Who guarded them.

83\. And (remember) Job, when  
He cried to his Lord,  
"Truly distress has seized me,  
But Thou art the Most

<span id="page_841">p. 841</span>

Merciful of those that are  
Merciful."

84\. So We listened to him:  
We removed the distress  
That was on him,  
And We restored his people  
To him, and doubled  
Their number,—as a Grace  
From Ourselves, and a thing  
For commemoration, for all  
Who serve Us.

85\. And (remember) Ismā‘īl,  
Idrīs, and Ẓul-kifl, all  
(Men) of constancy and patience;

86\. We admitted them to  
Our Mercy: for they  
Were of the Righteous ones.

<span id="page_842">p. 842</span>

87\. And remember Ẓun-nūn,  
When he departed in wrath:  
He imagined that We  
Had no power over him!  
But he cried through the depths  
Of darkness, "There is  
No god but Thou:  
Glory to Thee: I was  
Indeed wrong!"

88\. So We listened to him:  
And delivered him from  
Distress: and thus do We  
Deliver those who have faith.

89\. And (remember) Zakarīyā,  
When he cried to his Lord:  
"O my Lord! leave me not  
Without offspring, though Thou  
Art the best of inheritors."

90\. So We listened to him:  
And We granted him

<span id="page_843">p. 843</span>

Yabya: We cured his wife's  
(Barrenness) for him. These (three)  
Were ever quick in emulation  
In good works: they used  
To call on Us with love  
And reverence, and humble themselves  
Before Us.

91\. And (remember) her who  
Guarded her chastity:  
We breathed into her  
Of Our Spirit, and We  
Made her and her son  
A Sign for all peoples.

92\. Verily, this Brotherhood  
Of yours is a single Brotherhood,  
And I am your Lord  
And Cherisher: therefore  
Serve Me (and no other).

93\. But (later generations) cut off  
Their affair (of unity),  
One from another: (yet)  
Will they all return to Us.

<span id="page_844">p. 844</span>

##### SECTION 7.

94\. Whoever works any act  
Of Righteousness and has Faith,—  
His endeavour will not  
Be rejected: We shall  
Record it in his favour.

95\. But there is a ban  
On any population which  
We have destroyed: that they  
Shall not return,

96\. Until the Gog and Magog (people)  
Are let through (their barrier),  
And they swiftly swarm  
From every hill.

97\. Then will the True Promise  
Draw nigh (of fulfilment):  
Then behold! the eyes  
Of the Unbelievers will  
Fixedly stare in horror: "Ah!  
Woe to us! we were indeed  
Heedless of this; nay, we  
Truly did wrong!"

<span id="page_845">p. 845</span>

98\. Verily ye, (Unbelievers),  
And the (false) gods that  
Ye worship besides God,  
Are (but) fuel for Hell!  
To it will ye (surely) come!

99\. If these had been gods,  
They would not have got there!  
But each one will abide  
Therein.

100\. There, sobbing will be  
Their lot, nor will they  
There hear (aught else).

101\. Whose hose for whom  
The Good (Record) from Us  
Has gone before, will be  
Removed far therefrom.

102\. Not the slightest sound  
Will they hear of Hell:  
What their souls desired,  
In that will they dwell.

103\. The Great Terror will  
Bring them no grief:  
But the angels will meet them  
(With mutual greetings):  
"This is your Day,—  
(The Day) that ye were promised."

<span id="page_846">p. 846</span>

104\. The Day that We roll up  
The heavens like a scroll  
Rolled up for books (completed),—  
Even as We produced  
The first Creation, so  
Shall We produce  
A new one: a promise  
We have undertaken:  
Truly shall We fulfil it.

105\. Before this We wrote  
In the Psalms, after the Message  
(Given to Moses): "My servants,  
The righteous, shall inherit  
The earth."

106\. Verily in this (Qur-ān)  
Is a Message for people  
Who would (truly) worship God.

107\. We sent thee not, but  
As a Mercy for all creatures.

<span id="page_847">p. 847</span>

108\. Say: "What has come to me  
By inspiration is that  
Your God is One God:  
Will ye therefore bow  
To His Will (in Islām)?"

109\. But if they turn back,  
Say: "I have proclaimed  
The Message to you all alike  
And in truth; but I  
Know not whether that  
Which ye are promised  
Is near or far.

110\. "It is He Who knows  
What is open in speech  
And what ye hide  
(In your hearts).

111\. "I know not but that  
It may be a trial  
For you, and a grant  
Of (worldly) livelihood  
(To you) for a time."

<span id="page_848">p. 848</span>

112\. Say: "O my Lord!  
Judge Thou in truth!  
"Our Lord Most Gracious  
Is the One Whose assistance  
Should be sought against  
The blasphemies ye utter!

<span id="page_849">p. 849</span>
