### Sūra XLVIII.

### *Fat-ḥ* or Victory.

*In  the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Verily We have granted  
Thee a manifest Victory:

2\. That God may forgive thee  
Thy faults of the past  
And those to follow;  
Fulfil His favour to thee;  
And guide thee  
On the Straight Way;

3\. And that God may help  
Thee with powerful help.

4\. It is He Who sent  
Down Tranquillity  
Into the hearts of  
The Believers, that they may  
Add Faith to their Faith;—  
For to God belong

<span id="page_1392">p. 1392</span>

The Forces of the heavens  
And the earth; and God is  
Full of Knowledge and Wisdom;—

5\. That He may admit  
The men and women  
Who believe, to Gardens  
Beneath which rivers flow,  
To dwell therein for aye,  
And remove their ills  
From them;—and that is,  
In the sight of God,  
The highest achievement  
(For man),—

6\. And that He may punish  
The Hypocrites, men and  
Women, and the Polytheists,  
Men and women, who imagine  
An evil opinion of God.  
On them is a round  
Of Evil: the Wrath of God  
Is on them: He has cursed  
Them and got Hell ready  
For them: and evil  
Is it for a destination.

7\. For to God belong  
The Forces of the heavens  
And the earth; and God is  
Exalted in Power,  
Full of Wisdom.

<span id="page_1393">p. 1393</span>

8\. We have truly sent thee  
As a witness, as a  
Bringer of Glad Tidings,  
And as a Warner:

9\. In order that ye  
(O men) may believe  
In God and His Apostle,  
That ye may assist  
And honour Him,  
And celebrate His praises  
Morning and evening.

10\. Verily those who plight  
Their fealty to thee  
Do no less than plight  
Their fealty to God:  
The Hand of God is  
Over their hands:  
Then any one who violates  
His oath, does so  
To the harm of his own  
Soul, and any one who  
Fulfils what he has  
Covenanted with God,—  
God will soon grant him  
A great Reward.

##### SECTION 2.

11\. The desert Arabs who  
Lagged behind will

<span id="page_1394">p. 1394</span>

Say to thee:  
"We were engaged in  
(Looking after) our flocks  
And herds, and our families:  
Do thou then ask  
Forgiveness for us.  
They say with their tongues  
What is not in their hearts.  
Say: "Who then has  
Any power at all  
(To intervene) on your behalf  
With God, if His Will  
Is to give you some loss  
Or to give you some profit?  
But God is well acquainted  
With all that ye do.

12\. "Nay, ye thought that  
The Apostle and the Believers  
Would never return to  
Their families; this seemed  
Pleasing in your hearts, and  
Ye conceived an evil thought,  
For ye are a people  
Lost (in wickedness)."

13\. And if any believe not  
In God and His Apostle,  
We have prepared,  
For those who reject God,  
A Blazing Fire!

14\. To God belongs the dominion  
Of the heavens and the earth:  
He forgives whom He wills,  
And He punishes whom He

<span id="page_1395">p. 1395</span>

Wills: but God is  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

15\. Those who lagged behind  
(Will say), when ye (are  
Free to) march and take  
Booty (in war): "Permit us  
To follow you." They wish  
To change God's decree:  
Say: "Not thus  
Will ye follow us:  
God has already declared  
(This) beforehand": then they  
Will say, "But ye are  
Jealous of us." Nay,  
But little do they understand  
(Such things).

16\. Say to the desert Arabs  
Who lagged behind: "Ye  
Shall be summoned (to fight)  
Against a people given to  
Vehement war: then shall ye  
Fight, or they shall submit.  
Then if ye show obedience,  
God will grant you  
A goodly reward, but if  
Ye turn back as ye

<span id="page_1396">p. 1396</span>

Did before, He will punish  
You with a grievous Penalty."

17\. No blame is there  
On the blind, nor is  
There blame on the lame,  
Nor on one ill (if he  
Joins not the war):  
But he that obeys God  
And His Apostle,—(God)  
Will admit him to Gardens  
Beneath which rivers flow;  
And he who turns back,  
(God) will punish him  
With a grievous Penalty.

##### SECTION 3.

18\. God's Good Pleasure  
Was on the Believers  
When they swore Fealty  
To thee under the Tree:  
He knew what was  
In their hearts, and He  
Sent down Tranquillity  
To them; and He rewarded  
Them with a speedy Victory;

19\. And many gains will they  
Acquire (besides): and God  
Is Exalted in Power,  
Full of Wisdom.

<span id="page_1397">p. 1397</span>

20\. God has promised you  
Many gains that ye shall  
Acquire, and He has given  
You these beforehand; and  
He has restrained the hands  
Of men from you; that it  
May be a Sign for  
The Believers, and that  
He may guide you  
To a Straight Path;

21\. And other gains (there are),  
Which are not within  
Your power, but which  
God has compassed: and God  
Has power over all things.

22\. If the Unbelievers  
Should fight you, they would  
Certainly turn their backs;  
Then would they find  
Neither protector nor helper.

23\. (Such has been) the practice  
(Approved) of God already  
In the past: no change  
Wilt thou find in  
The practice (approved) of God.

24\. And it is He Who  
Has restrained their hands

<span id="page_1398">p. 1398</span>

From you and your hands  
From them in the midst  
Of Mecca, after that He  
Gave you the victory  
Over them. And God sees  
Well all that ye do.

25\. They are the ones who  
Denied revelation and hindered you  
From the Sacred Mosque  
And the sacrificial animals,  
Detained from reaching their  
Place of sacrifice. Had there  
Not been believing men  
And believing women whom  
Ye did not know that  
Ye were trampling down  
And on whose account  
A crime would have accrued  
To you without (your) knowledge,  
(God would have allowed you  
To force your way, but  
He held back your hands)  
That He may admit  
To His Mercy whom He will.  
If they had been  
Apart, We should

<span id="page_1399">p. 1399</span>

Certainly have punished  
The Unbelievers among them  
With a grievous punishment.

26\. While the Unbelievers  
Got up in their hearts  
Heat and cant—the heat  
And cant of Ignorance,—  
God sent down His Tranquillity  
To his Apostle and to  
The Believers, and made them  
Stick close to the command  
Of self-restraint; and well  
Were they entitled to it  
And worthy of it.  
And God has full knowledge  
Of all things.

##### SECTION 4.

27\. Truly did God fulfil  
The vision for His Apostle:  
Ye shall enter the Sacred  
Mosque, if God wills,  
With minds secure, heads shaved,  
Hair cut short, and without fear.  
For He knew what ye  
Knew not, and He granted,  
Besides this, a speedy victory.

28\. It is He Who has sent  
His Apostle with Guidance  
And the Religion of Truth,  
To proclaim it over

<span id="page_1400">p. 1400</span>

All religion: and enough  
Is God for a Witness.

29\. Muhammad is the Apostle  
Of God; and those who are  
With him are strong  
Against Unbelievers, (but)  
Compassionate amongst each other.  
Thou wilt see them bow  
And prostrate themselves  
(In prayer), seeking Grace  
From God and (His) Good  
Pleasure.  
On their faces are their  
Marks, (being) the traces  
Of their prostration.  
This is their similitude  
In the Taurāt;  
And their similitude  
In the Gospel is:  
Like a seed which sends  
Forth its blade, then  
Makes it strong; it then  
Becomes thick, and it stands

<span id="page_1401">p. 1401</span>

On its own stem, (filling)  
The sowers with wonder  
And delight. As a result,  
It fills the Unbelievers  
With rage at them.  
God has promised those  
Among them who believe  
And do righteous deeds  
Forgiveness,  
And a great Reward.
