### Sūra XXVIII.

### *Qaṣaṣ*, or the Narration.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. *Tā*. *Sīn*. *Mīm*.

2\. These are Verses of the Book  
That makes (things) clear.

3\. We rehearse to thee some  
Of the story of Moses  
And Pharaoh in Truth,  
For people who believe.

4\. Truly Pharaoh elated himself  
In the land and broke up  
Its people into sections,  
Depressing a small group  
Among them: their sons he slew,  
But he kept alive their females:  
For he was indeed  
A maker of mischief.

5\. And We wished to be  
Gracious to those who were  
Being depressed in the land,  
To make them leaders (in faith)  
And make them heirs,

<span id="page_1003">p. 1003</span>

6\. To establish a firm place  
For them in the land,  
And to show Pharaoh, Haman,  
And their hosts, at their hands,  
The very things against which  
They were taking precautions.

7\. So We sent this inspiration  
To the mother of Moses:  
"Suckle (thy child), but when  
Thou hast fears about him,  
Cast him into the river,  
But fear not nor grieve:  
For We shall restore him  
To thee, and We shall make  
Him one of Our apostles."

8\. Then the people of Pharaoh  
Picked him up (from the river):  
(It was intended) that (Moses)  
Should be to them an adversary  
And a cause of sorrow:  
For Pharaoh and Haman  
And (all) their hosts were  
Men of sin.

9\. The wife of Pharaoh said:  
"(Here is) a joy of the eye,'  
For me and for thee:  
Slay him not. It may be

<span id="page_1004">p. 1004</span>

That he will be of use  
To us, or we may adopt  
Him as a son." And they  
Perceived not (what they  
Were doing)!

10\. But there came to be  
A void in the heart  
Of the mother of Moses:  
She was going almost to  
Disclose his (case), had We  
Not strengthened her heart  
(With faith), so that she  
Might remain a (firm) believer.

11\. And she said to the sister  
Of (Moses), "Follow him".  
So she (the sister) watched him  
In the character of a stranger.  
And they knew not.

12\. And We ordained that he  
Refused suck at first, until  
(His sister came up  
And) said: "Shall I  
Point out to you the people  
Of a house that will nourish  
And bring him up for you'"  
And be sincerely attached  
To him?"...

13\. Thus did We restore him  
To his mother, that her eye  
Might be comforted, that she  
Might not grieve, and that  
She might know that the promise  
Of God is true: but  
Most of them do not understand.

<span id="page_1005">p. 1005</span>

##### SECTION 2.

14\. When he reached full age,  
And was firmly established  
(In life), We bestowed on him  
Wisdom and knowledge: for thus  
Do We reward those  
Who do good.

15\. And he entered the City  
At a time when its people  
Were not watching: and he  
Found there two men fighting,—  
One of his own religion,  
And the other, of his foes.  
Now the man of his own  
Religion appealed to him  
Against his foe, and Moses  
Struck him with his fist  
And made an end of him.  
He said: "This is a work  
Of Evil (Satan): for he is  
An enemy that manifestly  
Misleads!"

16\. He prayed: "O my Lord!  
I have indeed wronged my soul!  
Do Thou then forgive me!"  
So (God) forgave him: for He  
Is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

<span id="page_1006">p. 1006</span>

17\. He said: "O my Lord!  
For that Thou hast bestowed  
Thy Grace on me, never  
Shall I be a help  
To those who sin!"

18\. So he saw the morning  
In the City, looking about,  
In a state of fear, when  
Behold, the man who had,  
The day before, sought his help  
Called aloud for his help  
(Again). Moses said to him:  
"Thou art truly, it is clear,  
A quarrelsome fellow!"

19\. Then, when he decided to lay  
Hold of the man who was  
An enemy to both of them,  
That man said: "O Moses!  
Is it thy intention to slay me  
As thou slewest a man  
Yesterday? Thy intention is  
None other than to become  
A powerful violent man  
In the land, and not to be  
One who sets things right!

<span id="page_1007">p. 1007</span>

20\. And there came a man,  
Running, from the furthest end  
Of the City. He said:  
"O Moses! the Chiefs  
Are taking counsel together  
About thee, to slay thee:  
So get thee away, for I  
Do give thee sincere advice."

21\. He therefore got away therefrom,  
Looking about, in a state  
Of fear. He prayed:  
"O my Lord! save me  
From people given to wrong-doing."

##### SECTION 3.

22\. When, when he turned his face  
Towards (the land of) Madyan,  
He said: "I do hope  
That my Lord will show me  
The smooth and straight Path."

23\. And when he arrived at  
The watering (place) in Madyan;  
He found there a group  
Of men watering (their flocks),  
And besides them he found  
Two women who were keeping

<span id="page_1008">p. 1008</span>

Back (their flocks). He said:  
"What is the matter with you?"  
They said: "We cannot water  
(Our flocks) until the shepherds  
Take back (their flocks):  
And our father is  
A very old man."

24\. So he watered (their flocks)  
For them; then he turned back  
To the shade, and said:  
"O my Lord!  
Truly am I  
In (desperate) need  
Of any good  
That Thou dost send me!"

25\. Afterwards one of the (damsels)  
Came (back) to him, walking  
Bashfully. She said: "My father  
Invites thee that he may  
Reward thee for having watered  
(Our flocks) for us." So when  
He came to him and narrated  
The story, he said:

<span id="page_1009">p. 1009</span>

"Fear thou not: (well) hast thou  
Escaped from unjust people."

26\. Said one of the (damsels):  
"O my (dear) father! engage  
Him on wages: truly the best  
Of men for thee to employ is  
The (man) who is strong and trusty"…

27\. He said: "I intend to wed  
One of these my daughters  
To thee, on, condition that  
Thou serve me for eight years;  
But if thou complete ten years,  
It will be (grace) from thee.  
But I intend not to place  
Thee under a difficulty:

<span id="page_1010">p. 1010</span>

Thou wilt find me,  
Indeed, if God wills,  
One of the righteous."

28\. He said: "Be that (the agreement)  
Between me and thee:  
Whichever of the two terms  
I fulfil, let there be  
No ill-will to me.  
Be God a witness  
To what we say."

##### SECTION 4.

29\. Now when Moses had fulfilled  
The term, and was travelling  
With his family, he perceived  
A fire in the direction  
Of Mount Ṭūr. He said  
To his family: "Tarry ye;  
I perceive a fire; I hope  
To bring you from there  
Some information, or a burning  
Firebrand, that ye may  
Warm yourselves."

30\. But when he came  
To the (Fire), a voice

<span id="page_1011">p. 1011</span>

Was heard from the right bank  
Of the valley, from a tree  
In hallowed ground:  
"O Moses! Verily  
I am God, the Lord  
Of the Worlds…

31\. "Now do thou throw thy rod!"  
But when he saw it  
Moving (of its own accord)  
As if it had been a snake,  
He turned back in retreat,  
And retraced not his steps:  
"O Moses!" (it was said),  
"Draw near, and fear not:  
For thou art of those  
Who are secure.

32\. "Move thy hand into  
Thy bosom, and it will  
Come forth white without stain  
(Or harm), and draw thy hand  
Close to thy side  
(To guard) against fear.  
Those are the two credentials  
From thy Lord to Pharaoh  
And his Chiefs: for truly  
They are a people  
Rebellious and wicked."

33\. He said: "O my Lord!  
I have slain a man

<span id="page_1012">p. 1012</span>

Among them, and I fear  
Lest they slay me.

34\. "And my brother Aaron—  
He is more eloquent in speech  
Than I: so send him  
With me as a helper,  
To confirm (and strengthen) me:  
For I fear that they may  
Accuse me of falsehood."

35\. He said: "We will certainly  
Strengthen thy arm through  
Thy brother, and invest you both  
With authority, so they  
Shall not be able to  
Touch you: with Our Signs  
Shall ye triumph,—you two  
As well as those  
Who follow you."

36\. When Moses came to them  
With Our Clear Signs, they said:  
"This is nothing but sorcery  
Faked up: never did we  
Hear the like among our fathers  
Of old!"

<span id="page_1013">p. 1013</span>

37\. Moses said: "My Lord  
Knows best who it is  
That comes with guidance  
From Him and whose End  
Will be best in the Hereafter:  
Certain it is that  
The wrong-doers will not prosper."

38\. Pharaoh said: "O Chiefs!  
No god do I know for you  
But myself: therefore,  
O Haman! light me a (kiln  
To bake bricks) out of clay,  
And build me a lofty  
Palace, that I may mount up  
To the god of Moses:  
But as far as I am concerned,  
I think (Moses) is a liar!"

39\. And he was arrogant and insolent  
In the land, beyond reason,—  
He and his hosts: they thought  
That they would not have  
To return to Us!"

40\. So We seized him  
And his hosts, and We  
Flung them into the sea:  
Now behold what was the End  
Of those who did wrong!

<span id="page_1014">p. 1014</span>

41\. And We made them (but)  
Leaders inviting to the Fire;  
And on the Day of Judgment  
No help shall they find.

42\. In this world We made  
A Curse to follow them:  
And on the Day of Judgment  
They will be among  
The loathed (and despised).

##### SECTION 5.

43\. We did reveal to Moses  
The Book after We had  
Destroyed the earlier generations,  
(To give) Insight to men,  
And Guidance and Mercy,  
That they might receive admonition.

<span id="page_1015">p. 1015</span>

44\. Thou wast not on the Western  
Side when We decreed  
The Commission to Moses,  
Nor wast thou a witness  
(Of those events).

45\. But We raised up (new)  
Generations, and long were the ages  
That passed over them;  
But thou vast not a dweller  
Among the people of Madyan,  
Rehearsing Our Signs to them;  
But it is We Who send  
Apostles (with inspiration).

46\. Nor wast thou at the side  
Of (the Mountain of) Ṭūr  
When We called (to Moses).  
Yet (art thou sent)  
As a Mercy from thy Lord,  
To give warning to a people  
To whom no warner had come  
Before thee: in order that  
They may receive admonition.

47\. If (We had) not (sent thee  
To the Quraish),—in case  
A calamity should seize them  
For (the deeds) that their hands  
Have sent forth, they might say:  
"Our Lord! why didst Thou not

<span id="page_1016">p. 1016</span>

Send us an apostle? We  
Should then have followed  
Thy Signs and been amongst  
Those who believe!"

48\. But (now), when the Truth  
Has come to them from Ourselves,  
They say, "Why are not  
(Signs) sent to him, like  
Those which were sent to Moses?"  
Do they not then reject  
(The Signs) which were formerly  
Sent to Moses? They say:  
"Two kinds of sorcery,  
Each assisting the other .  
And they say: "For us,  
We reject all (such things)!"

49\. Say: "Then bring ye  
A Book from God,  
Which is a better Guide  
Than either of them,  
That I may follow it!  
(Do), if ye are truthful!"

50\. But if they hearken not  
To thee, know that they  
Only follow their own lusts:  
And who is more astray  
Than one who follows his own  
Lusts, devoid of guidance  
From God? For God guides not  
People given to wrong-doing.

<span id="page_1017">p. 1017</span>

##### SECTION 6.

51\. Now have We caused  
The Word to reach them  
Themselves, in order that  
They may receive admonition.

52\. Those to whom We sent  
The Book before this,—they  
Do believe in this (Revelation);

53\. And when it is recited  
To them, they say: "We  
Believe therein, for it is  
The Truth from our Lord:  
Indeed we have been Muslims  
(Bowing to God's Will)  
From before this.

54\. Twice will they be given  
Their reward, for that they  
Have persevered, that they avert  
Evil with Good, and that  
They spend (in charity) out of  
What We have given them.

55\. And when they hear vain talk,  
They turn away therefrom  
And say: "To us our deeds,  
And to you yours;

<span id="page_1018">p. 1018</span>

Peace be to you: we  
Seek not the ignorant."

56\. It is true thou wilt not  
Be able to guide every one;  
Whom thou lowest; but God  
Guides those whom He will.  
And He knows best those  
Who receive guidance.

57\. They say: "If we were  
To follow the guidance with thee,  
We should be snatched away  
From our land." Have We not  
Established for them a secure  
Sanctuary, to which are brought  
As tribute fruits of all kinds,—  
A provision from Ourselves?  
But most of them understand not.

58\. And how many populations  
We destroyed, which exulted  
In their life (of ease and plenty)!  
Now those habitations of theirs,  
After them, are deserted,—  
All but a (miserable) few!  
And We are their heirs!"

<span id="page_1019">p. 1019</span>

59\. Nor was thy Lord the one  
To destroy a population until  
He had sent to its Centre  
An apostle, rehearsing to them  
Our Signs; nor are We  
Going to destroy a population  
Except when its members  
Practise iniquity.

60\. The (material) things which  
Ye are given are but  
The conveniences of this life  
And the glitter thereof;  
But that which is with God  
Is better and more enduring:  
Will ye not then be wise?

##### SECTION 7.

61\. Are (these two) alike?—  
One to whom We have made  
A goodly promise, and who  
Is going to reach its (fulfilment),  
And one to whom We have  
Given the good things of this  
Life, but who, on the Day  
Of Judgment, is to be among  
Those brought up (for punishment)?

<span id="page_1020">p. 1020</span>

62\. That Day (God) will  
Call to them, and say:  
"Where are My 'partners'?—  
Whom ye imagined (to be such)?"

63\. Those against whom the charge  
Will be proved, will say:  
"Our Lord! These are the ones  
Whom we led astray:  
We led them astray, as we  
Were astray ourselves: we free  
Ourselves (from them) in Thy presence:  
It was not us they worshipped."

64\. It will be said (to them):  
"Call upon your 'partners'  
(For help)": they will call  
Upon them, but they will not  
Listen to them; and they  
Will see the Penalty (before them);  
(How they will wish)  
'If only they had been  
Open to guidance!'

65\. That Day (God) will  
Call to them, and say:  
"What was the answer  
Ye gave to the apostles?"

66\. Then the (whole) story that day  
Will seem obscure to them  
(Like light to the blind)  
And they will not be able  
(Even) to question each other.

<span id="page_1021">p. 1021</span>

67\. But any that (in this life)  
Had repented, believed, and worked  
Righteousness, will have hopes  
To be among those who  
Achieve salvation.

68\. Why by Lord does create and choose  
As He pleases: no choice  
Have they (in the matter):  
Glory to God! and far  
Is He above the partners  
They ascribe (to Him)!

69\. And thy Lord knows all  
That their hearts conceal  
And all that they reveal.

70\. And He is God: there is  
No god. but He. To Him  
Be praise, at the first  
And at the last:  
For Him is the Command,  
And to Him shall ye  
(All) be brought back.

71\. Say: See ye? If God  
Were to make the Night

<span id="page_1022">p. 1022</span>

Perpetual over you to the Day  
Of Judgment, what god  
Is there other than God,  
Who can give you enlightenment?  
Will ye not then hearken?

72\. Say: See ye? If God  
Were to make the Day  
Perpetual over you to the Day  
Of Judgment, what god  
Is there other than God,  
Who can give you a Night  
In which ye can rest?  
Will ye not then see?

73\. It is out of His Mercy  
That He has made for you  
Night and Day,—that ye  
May rest therein, and that  
Ye may seek of His Grace;—  
And in order that ye  
May be grateful.

74\. The Day that He will  
Call on them, He will say:  
"Where are My 'partners'?—  
Whom ye imagined (to be such)?"

75\. And from each people  
Shall We draw a witness,  
And We shall say: "Produce  
Your Proof": then shall they  
Know that the Truth is in  
God (alone), and the (lies)  
Which they invented will  
Leave them in the lurch.

<span id="page_1023">p. 1023</span>

##### SECTION 8.

76\. Qārūn was doubtless,  
Of the people of Moses; but  
He acted insolently towards them:  
Such were the treasures We  
Had bestowed on him, that  
Their very keys would  
Have been a burden to  
A body of strong men.  
Behold, his people said to him:  
"Exult not, for God loveth not  
Those who exult (in riches).

77\. "But seek, with the (wealth)  
Which God has bestowed on thee,  
The Home of the Hereafter,  
Nor forget thy portion in this

<span id="page_1024">p. 1024</span>

World: but do thou good,  
As God has been good  
To thee, and seek not  
(Occasions for) mischief in the land:  
For God loves not those  
Who do mischief."

78\. He said: "This has been given  
To me because of a certain  
Knowledge which I have."  
Did he not know that God  
Had destroyed, before him,  
(Whole) generations,—which were  
Superior to him in strength  
And greater in the amount  
(Of riches) they had collected?  
But the wicked are not  
Called (immediately) to account  
For their sins.

79\. So he went forth among  
His people in the (pride  
Of his worldly) glitter.  
Said those whose aim is  
The Life of this World:  
"Oh! that we had the like  
Of what Qārūn has got!  
For he is truly a lord  
Of mighty good fortune!"

80\. But those who had been granted  
(True) knowledge said: "Alas  
For you! The reward of God  
(In the Hereafter) is best  
For those who believe  
And work righteousness: but this

<span id="page_1025">p. 1025</span>

None shall attain, save those  
Who steadfastly persevere  
(in good)."

81\. Then We caused the earth  
To swallow up him and  
His house; and he had not  
(The least little) party  
To help him against God,  
Nor could he defend himself.

82\. And those who had envied  
His position the day before  
Began to say on the morrow:  
"Ah! It is indeed God  
Who enlarges the provision"'  
Or restricts it, to any  
Of His servants He pleases!  
Had it not been that God  
Was gracious to us, He  
Could have caused the earth  
To swallow us up! Ah!  
Those who reject God  
Will assuredly never prosper."

##### SECTION 9.

83\. What Home of the Hereafter  
We shall give to those  
Who intend not high-handedness  
Or mischief on earth:

<span id="page_1026">p. 1026</span>

And the End is (best)  
For the righteous.

84\. If any does good, the reward  
To him is better than  
His deed; but if any  
Does evil, the doers of evil  
Are only punished (to the extent)  
Of their deeds.

85\. Verily He Who ordained  
The Qur-ān for thee, will bring  
Thee back to the Place  
Of Return. Say: "My Lord  
Knows best who it is  
That brings true guidance,  
And who is in manifest error."

86\. And thou hadst not expected  
That the Book would be  
Sent to thee except as  
A Mercy from thy Lord:  
Therefore lend not thou support  
In any way to those

<span id="page_1027">p. 1027</span>

Who reject (God's Message).

87\. And let nothing keep thee  
Back from the Signs of God  
After they have been revealed  
To thee: and invite (men)  
To thy Lord, and be not  
Of the company of those  
Who join gods with God.

88\. And call not, besides God,  
On another god. There is  
No god but He. Everything  
(That exists) will perish  
Except His own Face  
To Him belongs the Command,  
And to Him will ye  
(All) be brought back.
