### Sūra XLI.

### *Ḥā-mīm* (Abbreviated Letters), or *Ḥā-Mīm Sajda,* or *Fuṣṣilat*

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. *Ḥā-Mīm*:

2\. A revelation from (God).  
Most Gracious, Most Merciful—

3\. A Book, whereof the verses  
Are explained in detail;—  
A Qur-ān in Arabic,  
For people who understand;—

4\. Giving Good News  
And Admonition: yet most  
Of them turn away  
And so they hear not.

5\. They say: "Our hearts are  
Under veils, (concealed)  
From that to which thou  
Dost invite us, and  
In our ears is a deafness,  
And between us and thee  
Is a screen: so do  
Thou (what thou wilt);

<span id="page_1288">p. 1288</span>

For us, we shall do  
(What we will!)"

6\. Say thou: "I am  
But a man like you:  
It is revealed to me  
By inspiration, that your God  
Is One God: so stand  
True to Him, and ask  
For His forgiveness."  
And woe to those who  
Join gods with God,—

7\. Those who practise not  
Regular Charity, and who  
Even deny the Hereafter.

8\. For those who believe  
And work deeds of righteousness  
Is a reward that will  
Never fail.

##### SECTION 2.

9\. Say: Is it that ye  
Deny Him Who created  
The earth in two Days?  
And do ye join equals  
With Him? He is  
The Lord of (all)  
The Worlds.

<span id="page_1289">p. 1289</span>

10\. He set on the (earth),  
Mountains standing firm,  
High above it,  
And bestowed blessings on  
The earth, and measured therein  
All things to give them  
Nourishment in due proportion,  
In four Days, in accordance  
With (the needs of)  
Those who seek (sustenance).

11\. Moreover He comprehended  
In His design the sky,  
And it had been (as) smoke:  
He said to it  
And to the earth:  
"Come ye together,  
Willingly or unwillingly."  
They said: "We do come  
(Together), in willing obedience."

12\. So he completed them  
As seven firmaments

<span id="page_1290">p. 1290</span>

In two Days, and He  
Assigned to each heaven  
Its duty and command.  
And We adorned  
The lower heaven  
With lights, and (provided it)  
With guard. Such  
Is the Decree of (Him)  
The Exalted in Might,  
Full of knowledge.

13\. But if they turn away,  
Say thou: "I have warned  
You of a stunning Punishment  
(As of thunder and lightning)  
Like that which (overtook)  
The ‘Ād and the <u>Th</u>amūd!"

14\. Behold, the apostles came  
To them, from before them  
And behind them, (preaching):  
"Serve none but God."  
They said, "If our Lord  
Had so pleased, He would

<span id="page_1291">p. 1291</span>

Certainly have sent down angels  
(To preach): now we reject  
Your mission (altogether)."

15\. Now the ‘Ād behaved  
Arrogantly through the land,  
Against (all) truth and reason,  
And said: "Who is superior  
To us in strength?" What!  
Did they not see that  
God, Who created them,  
Was superior to them  
In strength? But they  
Continued to reject Our Signs!

16\. So We sent against them  
A furious Wind through days  
Of disaster, that We might  
Give them a taste  
Of a Penalty of humiliation  
In this Life; but the Penalty  
Of a Hereafter will be  
More humiliating still:  
And they will find  
No help.

17\. As to the <u>Th</u>amūd,  
We gave them guidance,  
But they preferred blindness  
(Of heart) to Guidance:  
So the stunning Punishment  
Of humiliation seized them,  
Because of what they had earned.

<span id="page_1292">p. 1292</span>

18\. But We delivered those  
Who believed and practised righteousness.

##### SECTION 3.

19\. On the Day that  
The enemies of God  
Will be gathered together  
To the Fire, they will  
Be marched in ranks.

20\. At length, when they reach  
The (Fire), their hearing,  
Their sight, and their skins  
Will bear witness against them,  
As to (all) their deeds.

21\. They will say to their skins:  
"Why bear ye witness  
Against us?" They will say:  
"God hath given us speech,—  
(He) Who giveth speech  
To everything: He created  
You for the first time,  
And unto Him were ye  
To return.

22\. "Ye did not seek  
To hide yourselves, lest

<span id="page_1293">p. 1293</span>

Your hearing, your sight,  
And your skins should bear  
Witness against you! But  
Ye did think that God  
Knew not many of [the](errata.htm#8.md) things  
That ye used to do!

23\. "But this thought of yours  
Which ye did entertain  
Concerning your Lord, hath  
Brought you to destruction,  
And (now) have ye become  
Of those utterly lost!"

24\. If, then, they have patience,  
The Fire will be  
A Home for them!  
And if they beg  
To be received into favour,  
Into favour will they not  
(Then) be received.

25\. And We have destined  
For them intimate companions  
(Of like nature), who made  
Alluring to them what was  
Before them and behind them;  
And the sentence among  
The previous generations of Jinns  
And men; who have passed away,

<span id="page_1294">p. 1294</span>

Is proved against them;  
For they are utterly lost.

##### SECTION 4.

26\. The Unbelievers say  
"Listen not to this Qur-ān,  
But talk at random  
In the midst  
Of its (reading), that ye  
May gain the upper hand!"

27\. But We will certainly  
Give the Unbelievers a taste  
Of a severe Penalty,  
And We will requite them  
For the worst of their deeds.

28\. Such is the requital  
Of the enemies of God,—  
The Fire: therein will be  
For them the Eternal Home:  
A (fit) requital, for  
That they were wont  
To reject Our Signs.

29\. And the Unbelievers will say:  
"Our Lord! Show us those,  
Among Jinns and men,  
Who misled us: we shall  
Crush them beneath our feet,  
So that they become  
The vilest (before all)."

30\. In the case of those  
Who say, "Our Lord

<span id="page_1295">p. 1295</span>

Is God", and, further,  
Stand straight and steadfast,  
The angels descend on them.  
(From time to time):  
"Fear ye not!" (they suggest),  
"Nor grieve! But receive  
The Glad Tidings  
Of the Garden (of Bliss),  
The which ye were promised!

31\. "We are your protectors  
In this life and  
In the Hereafter:  
Therein shall ye have  
All that your souls  
Shall desire; therein  
Shall ye have all  
That ye ask for!—

32\. "A hospitable gift from One  
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!"

<span id="page_1296">p. 1296</span>

##### SECTION 5.

33\. Who is better in speech  
Than one who calls (men)  
To God, works righteousness,  
And says, "I am of those  
Who bow in Islam"?

34\. Nor can Goodness and Evil  
Be equal. Repel (Evil)  
With what is better:  
Then will he between whom  
And thee was hatred  
Become as it were  
Thy friend and intimate!

35\. And no one will be  
Granted such goodness  
Except those who exercise  
Patience and self-restraint,—  
None but persons of  
The greatest good fortune.

<span id="page_1297">p. 1297</span>

36\. And if (at any time)  
An incitement to discord  
Is made to thee  
By the Evil One,  
Seek refuge in God.  
He is the One  
Who hears and knows  
All things.

37\. Among His Signs are  
The Night and the Day,  
And the Sun and the Moon.  
Adore not the sun  
And the moon, but adore  
God, Who created them,  
If it is. Him ye wish  
To serve.

38\. But if the (Unbelievers)  
Are arrogant, (no matter):  
For in the presence  
Of thy Lord are those  
Who celebrate His praises  
By night and by day.  
And they never flag  
(Nor feel themselves  
Above it).

<span id="page_1298">p. 1298</span>

39\. And among His Signs  
In this: thou seest  
The earth barren and desolate;  
But when We send down  
Rain to it, it is stirred  
To life and yields increase.  
Truly, He Who gives life  
To the (dead) earth  
Can surely give life  
To (men) who are dead.  
For He has power  
Over all things.

40\. Those who pervert  
The Truth in Our Signs  
Are not hidden from Us.  
Which is better?—he that  
Is cast into the Fire,  
Or he that comes safe through,  
On the Day of Judgment?  
Do what ye will:  
Verily He seeth (clearly)  
All that ye do.

41\. Those who reject the Message  
When it comes to them

<span id="page_1299">p. 1299</span>

(Are not hidden from Us).  
And indeed it is a Book  
Of exalted power.

42\. No falsehood can approach it  
From before or behind it:  
It is sent down  
By One Full of Wisdom,  
Worthy of all Praise.

43\. Nothing is said to thee  
That was not said  
To the apostles before thee:  
That thy Lord has  
At His command (all) Forgiveness  
As well as a most  
Grievous Penalty.

44\. Had We sent this as  
A Qur-ān (in a language)  
Other than Arabic, they would  
Have said: "Why are not  
Its verses explained in detail?  
What! (a Book) not in Arabic  
And (a Messenger) an Arab?"  
Say: "It is a guide

<span id="page_1300">p. 1300</span>

And a healing to those  
Who believe; and for those  
Who believe not, there is  
A deafness in their ears,  
And it is blindness in their (eyes):  
They are (as it were)  
Being called from a place  
Far distant!"

##### SECTION 6.

45\. We certainly gave Moses  
The Book aforetime: but disputes  
Arose therein. Had it not  
Been for a Word  
That went forth before  
From thy Lord, (their differences)  
Would have been settled  
Between them: but they  
Remained in suspicious  
Disquieting doubt thereon.

46\. Whoever works righteousness  
Benefits his own soul;  
Whoever works evil, it is  
Against his own soul:  
Nor is thy Lord ever  
Unjust (in the least)  
To His servants.

<span id="page_1301">p. 1301</span>

47\. To Him is referred  
The Knowledge of the Hour  
(Of Judgment: He knows all):  
No date-fruit comes out  
Of its sheath, nor does  
A female conceive (within  
Her womb) nor bring forth  
(Young), but by His Knowledge.  
The Day that (God) will propound  
To them the (question),  
"Where are the Partners  
(Ye attributed) to Me?"  
They will say, "We do  
Assure Thee not one  
Of us can bear witness!"

48\. The (deities) they used to invoke  
Aforetime will leave them  
In the lurch, and they  
Will perceive that they  
Have no way of escape.

49\. Man does not weary  
Of asking for good (things),  
But if ill touches him,  
He gives up all hope  
(And) is lost in despair.

50\. When We give him a taste  
Of some mercy from Ourselves.

<span id="page_1302">p. 1302</span>

After some adversity has  
Touched him, he is sure  
To say, "This is due  
To my (merit): I think not  
That the Hour (of Judgment)  
Will (ever) be established;  
But if I am brought back  
To my Lord, I have  
(Much) good (stored) in His sight!"  
But We will show  
The Unbelievers the truth  
Of all that they did,  
And We shall give them  
The taste of a severe  
Penalty.

51\. When We bestow favours  
On man, he turns away,  
And gets himself remote  
On his side (instead of'  
Coming to Us); and when  
Evil seizes him, (he comes)  
Full of prolonged prayer!

52\. Say: "See ye if  
The (Revelation) is (really)  
From God, and yet do ye  
Reject it? Who is more  
Astray than one who  
Is in a schism  
Far (from any purpose)?"

53\. Soon will We show them  
Our Signs in the (furthest)

<span id="page_1303">p. 1303</span>

Regions (of the earth), and  
In their own souls, until  
It becomes manifest to them  
That this is the Truth.  
Is it not enough that  
Thy Lord doth witness  
All things?

54\. Ah indeed! are they  
In doubt concerning  
The Meeting with their Lord?  
Ah indeed! it is He  
That doth encompass  
All things!
