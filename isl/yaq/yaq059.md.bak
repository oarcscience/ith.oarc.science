### Sūra LIX.

### *Ḥa<u>sh</u>r,* or The Gathering

###### (or Banishment, lix. 2-3).

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Whatever is  
In the heavens and  
On earth, let it declare  
The Praises and Glory  
Of God: for He is  
The Exalted in Might,  
The Wise.

2\. It is He Who got out  
The Unbelievers among  
The People of the Book  
From their homes  
At the first gathering  
(Of the forces).  
Little did ye think  
That they would get out:  
And they thought  
That their fortresses  
Would defend them from God!  
But the (Wrath of) God

<span id="page_1521">p. 1521</span>

Came to them from quarters  
From which they little  
Expected (it), and cast  
Terror into their hearts,  
So that they destroyed  
Their dwellings by their own  
Hands and the hands  
Of the Believers.  
Take warning, then,  
O ye with eyes (to see)!

3\. And had it not been  
That God had decreed  
Banishment for them,  
He would certainly have  
Punished them in this world:  
And in the Hereafter  
They shall (certainly) have  
The Punishment of the Fire.

4\. That is because they  
Resisted God and His Apostle:  
And if any one resists God,  
Verily God is severe  
In Punishment.

<span id="page_1522">p. 1522</span>

5\. Whether ye cut down  
(O ye Muslims!)  
The tender palm-trees,  
Or ye left them standing  
On their roots, it was  
By leave of God, and  
In order that He might  
Cover with shame  
The rebellious transgressors.

6\. What God has bestowed  
On His Apostle (and taken  
Away) from them—for this  
Ye made no expedition  
With either cavalry or camelry:  
But God gives power  
To His apostles over  
Any He pleases: and God  
Has power over all things.

7\. What God has bestowed  
On His Apostle (and taken  
Away) from the people  
Of the townships,—belongs

<span id="page_1523">p. 1523</span>

To God,—to His Apostle  
And to kindred and orphans,  
The needy and the wayfarer;  
In order that it may not  
(Merely) make a circuit  
Between the wealthy among you.  
So take what the Apostle  
Assigns to you, and deny  
Yourselves that which he  
Withholds from you.  
And fear God; for God  
Is strict in Punishment.

8\. (Some part is due)  
To the indigent Muhājirs,  
Those who were expelled  
From their homes and their property,  
While seeking Grace from God  
And (His) Good Pleasure,  
And aiding God and His Apostle:  
Such are indeed  
The sincere ones;—

9\. But those who  
Before them, had homes  
(In Medina)  
And had adopted the Faith,—  
Show their affection to such  
As came to them for refuge,  
And entertain no desire  
In their hearts for things

<span id="page_1524">p. 1524</span>

Given to the (latter),  
But give them preference  
Over themselves, even though  
Poverty was their (own lot).  
And those saved from  
The covetousness of their own  
Souls,—they are the ones  
That achieve prosperity.

10\. And those who came  
After them say: "Our Lord!  
Forgive us, and our brethren  
Who came before us  
Into the Faith,  
And leave not,  
In our hearts,  
Rancour (or sense of injury)  
Against those who have believed.  
Our Lord! Thou art  
Indeed Full of Kindness,  
Most Merciful."

##### SECTION 2.

11\. Hast thou not observed  
The Hypocrites say  
To their misbelieving brethren  
Among the People of the Book?—  
"If ye are expelled,  
We too will go out  
With you, and we will  
Never hearken, to any one  
In your affair; and if  
Ye are attacked (in fight)

<span id="page_1525">p. 1525</span>

We will help you".  
But God is witness  
That they are indeed liars.

12\. If they are expelled,  
Never will they go out  
With them; and if they  
Are attacked (in fight),  
They will never help them;  
And if they do help them,  
They will turn their backs;  
So they will receive no help.

13\. Of a truth ye are  
Stronger (than they)  
Because of the terror  
In their hearts,  
(Sent) by God.  
This is because they are  
Men devoid of understanding.

14\. They will not fight you  
(Even) together, except  
In fortified townships,  
Or from behind walls.  
Strong is their fighting (spirit)  
Amongst themselves:  
Thou wouldst think  
They were united,  
But their hearts are divided:  
That is because they

<span id="page_1526">p. 1526</span>

Are a people devoid  
Of wisdom.

15\. Like those who lately  
Preceded them, they have  
Tasted the evil result  
Of their conduct; and  
(In the Hereafter there is)  
For them a grievous Penalty;—

16\. (Their allies deceived them),  
Like the Evil One,  
When he says to man,  
"Deny God": but when  
(Man) denies God,  
(The Evil One) says,  
"I am free of thee:  
I do fear God,  
The Lord of the Worlds!"

17\. The end of both will be  
That they will go  
Into the Fire, dwelling  
Therein for ever.  
Such is the reward  
Of the wrong-doers.

##### SECTION 3.

18\. O ye who believe!  
Fear God,

<span id="page_1527">p. 1527</span>

And let every soul look  
To what (provision) he has  
Sent forth for the morrow.  
Yea, fear God:  
For God is well-acquainted  
With (all) that ye do.

19\. And be ye not like  
Those who forgot God;  
And He made them forget  
Their own souls! Such  
Are the rebellious transgressors!

20\. Not equal are  
The Companions of the Fire  
And the Companions  
Of the Garden:  
It is the Companions  
Of the Garden,  
That will achieve Felicity.

21\. Had We sent down  
This Qur-ān on a mountain,  
Verily, thou wouldst have seen  
It humble itself and cleave

<span id="page_1528">p. 1528</span>

Asunder for fear of God.  
Such are the similitudes  
Which We propound to men,  
That they may reflect.

22\. God is He, than Whom  
There is no other god;—  
Who knows (all things)  
Both secret and open;  
He, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.

23\. God is He, than Whom  
There is no other god;—  
The Sovereign, the Holy One,  
The Source of Peace  
(and Perfection),  
The Guardian of Faith,  
The Preserver of Safety,  
The Exalted in Might,  
The Irresistible, the Supreme:

<span id="page_1529">p. 1529</span>

Glory to God!  
(High is He)  
Above the partners  
They attribute to Him.

24\. He is God, the Creator,  
The Evolver,  
The Bestower of Forms  
(Or Colours).  
To Him belongs  
The Most Beautiful Names:  
Whatever is in  
The heavens and on earth,  
Doth declare  
His Praises and Glory:  
And He is the Exalted  
In Might, the Wise.
