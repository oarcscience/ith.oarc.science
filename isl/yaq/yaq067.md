### Sūra LXVII.

### *Mulk,* or Dominion.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Blessed be He  
In Whose hands  
Is Dominion;  
And He over all things  
Hath Power;—

2\. He Who created Death  
And Life, that He  
May try which of you  
Is best in deed:  
And He is the Exalted  
In Might, Oft-Forgiving;—

<span id="page_1577">p. 1577</span>

3\. He Who created  
The seven heavens  
One above another:  
No want of proportion  
Wilt thou see  
In the Creation  
Of (God) Most Gracious.  
So turn thy vision again:  
Seest thou any flaw?

4\. Again turn thy vision  
A second time: (thy) vision  
Will come back to thee  
Dull and discomfited,  
In a state worn out.

5\. And We have,  
(From of old),  
Adorned the lowest heaven  
With Lamps, and We  
Have made such (Lamps)  
(As) missiles to drive  
Away the Evil Ones,  
And have prepared for them  
The Penalty  
Of the Blazing Fire.

6\. For those who reject  
Their Lord (and Cherisher)

<span id="page_1578">p. 1578</span>

Is the Penalty of Hell:  
And evil is (such) destination.

7\. When they are cast therein,  
They will hear  
The (terrible) drawing in  
Of its breath  
Even as it blazes forth,

8\. Almost bursting with fury:  
Every time a Group  
Is cast therein, its Keepers  
Will ask, "Did no Warner  
Come to you?"

9\. They will say: "Yes indeed;  
A Warner did come to us,  
But we rejected him  
And said, "God never  
Sent down any (Message):  
Ye are innothing but  
An egregious delusion!"

10\. They will further say:  
"Had we but listened  
Or used our intelligence,  
We should not (now)

<span id="page_1579">p. 1579</span>

Be among the Companions  
Of the Blazing Fire!"

11\. They will then confess  
Their sins: but far  
Will be (Forgiveness)  
From the Companions  
Of the Blazing Fire!

12\. As for those who  
Fear their Lord unseen,  
For them is Forgiveness  
And a great Reward.

13\. And whether ye hide  
Your word or publish it,  
He certainly has (full) knowledge,  
Of the secrets of (all) hearts.

14\. Should He not know,—  
He that created?  
And He is the One  
That understands the finest  
Mysteries (and) is  
Well-acquainted (with them).

##### SECTION 2.

15\. It is He Who has  
Made the earth manageable

<span id="page_1580">p. 1580</span>

For you, so traverse  
Ye through its tracts  
And enjoy of the Sustenance  
Which He furnishes: but  
Unto Him is the Resurrection.

16\. Do ye feel secure that  
He Who is in Heaven  
Will not cause you  
To be swallowed up  
By the earth when it  
Shakes (as in an earthquake)?

17\. Or do ye feel secure  
That He Who is in Heaven  
Will not send against you  
A violent tornado  
(With showers of stones),  
So that ye shall  
Know how (terrible)  
Was My warning?

18\. But indeed men before them  
Rejected (My warning):  
Then how (terrible) was  
My rejection (of them)?

19\. Do they not observe  
The birds above them,

<span id="page_1581">p. 1581</span>

Spreading their wings  
And folding them in?  
None can uphold them  
Except (God) Most Gracious:  
Truly it is He  
That watches over all things.

20\. Nay, who is there  
That can help you,  
(Even as) an army,  
Besides (God) Most Merciful?  
In nothing but delusion  
Are the Unbelievers.

21\. Or who is there  
That can provide you  
With Sustenance if He  
Were to withhold His provision?  
Nay, they obstinately persist  
In insolent impiety  
And flight (from the Truth).

22\. Is then one who  
Walks headlong, with his face  
Grovelling, better guided,—  
Or one who walks  
Evenly on a Straight Way?

<span id="page_1582">p. 1582</span>

23\. Say: "It is He Who  
Has created you (and made  
You grow), and made  
For you the faculties  
Of hearing, seeing,  
Feeling and understanding:  
Little thanks it is ye give.

24\. Say: "It is He Who  
Has multiplied you  
Through the earth,  
And to Him shall ye  
Be gathered together."

25\. They ask: When will  
This promise be (fulfilled)?—  
If ye are telling  
The truth.

26\. Say: "As to the knowledge  
Of the time, it is  
With God alone:  
I am (sent) only  
To warn plainly in public."

27\. At length, when they  
See it close at hand,  
Grieved will be the faces  
Of the Unbelievers,

<span id="page_1583">p. 1583</span>

And it will be said  
(To them): "This is  
(The promise fulfilled),  
Which ye were calling for!"

28\. Say: "See ye?—  
If God were  
To destroy me,  
And those with me,  
Or if He bestows  
His Mercy on us,—  
Yet who can deliver  
The Unbelievers from  
A grievous Penalty?"

29\. Say: "He is (God)  
Most Gracious: we have  
Believed in Him,  
And on Him have we  
Put our trust:  
So, soon will ye know  
Which (of us) it is  
That is in manifest error."

30\. Say: "See ye?—  
If your stream be  
Some morning lost  
(In the underground earth),  
Who then can supply you  
With clear-flowing water?"
