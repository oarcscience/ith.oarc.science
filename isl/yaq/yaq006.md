### Sūra VI.

### An’ām, or Cattle.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*.

1\. Praise be to God,  
Who created the heavens  
And the earth,  
And made the Darkness  
And the Light.  
Yet those who reject Faith  
Hold (others) as equal.  
With their Guardian-Lord.

2\. He it is Who created  
You from clay, and then  
Decreed a stated term  
(For you). And there is  
In His Presence another  
Determined term; yet  
Ye doubt within yourselves!

3\. And He is God  
In the heavens  
And on earth.  
He knoweth what ye  
Hide, and what ye reveal,  
And He knoweth  
The (recompense) which  
Ye earn (by your deeds)

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

4\. But never did a single  
One of the Signs  
Of their Lord reach them,  
But they turned  
Away therefrom.

5\. And now they reject  
The truth when it reaches  
Them: but soon shall they  
Learn the reality of what  
They used to mock at.

6\. See they not how many  
Of those before them  
We did destroy?—  
Generations We had established  
On the earth, in strength  
Such as We have not given  
To you—for whom  
We poured out rain  
From the skies in abundance,  
And gave (fertile) streams  
Flowing beneath their (feet):  
Yet for their sins  
We destroyed them,  
And raised in their wake  
Fresh generations  
(To succeed them).

7\. If We had sent  
Unto thee a written  
(Message) on parchment,  
So that they could  
Touch it with their hands,  
The Unbelievers would  
Have been sure to say:  
"This is nothing but

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

Obvious magic!"

8\. They say: "Why is not  
An angel sent down to him?"  
If We did send down  
An angel, the matter  
Would be settled at once,  
And no respite  
Would be granted them.

9\. If We had made it  
An angel, We should  
Have sent him as a man,  
And We should certainly  
Have caused them confusion  
In a matter which they have  
Already covered with confusion.

10\. Mocked were (many)  
Apostles before thee;  
But their scoffers  
Were hemmed in  
By the thing that they mocked.

##### SECTION 2.

11\. Say: "Travel through the earth  
And see what was the end  
Of those who rejected Truth".

12\. Say: "To whom I elongeth  
All that is in the heavens

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

And on earth?" Say:  
"To God. He hath inscribed  
For Himself (the rule of) Mercy.  
That He will gather you  
Together for the Day of Judgment,  
There is no doubt whatever.  
It is they who have lost  
Their own souls, that will  
Not believe.

13\. To him belongeth all  
That dwelleth (or lurketh)  
In the Night and the Day.  
For He is the One  
Who heareth and knoweth  
All things."

14\. Say: "Shall I take  
For my protector  
Any other than God,  
The Maker of the heavens  
And the earth?  
And He it is that  
Feedeth but is not fed."  
Say: "Nay! but I am  
Commanded to be the first  
Of those who bow  
To God (in Islam),  
And be not thou  
Of the company of those  
Who join gods with God."

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

15\. Say: "I would, if I  
Disobeyed my Lord,  
Indeed have fear  
Of the Penalty  
Of a Mighty Day.

16\. "On that day, if the Penalty  
Is averted from any,  
It is due to God's Mercy;  
And that would be (Salvation),  
The obvious fulfilment  
Of all desire.

17\. "If God touch thee  
With affliction, none  
Can remove it but He;  
If He touch thee with happiness,  
He hath power over all things.

18\. "He is the Irresistible, (watching)  
From above over His worshippers;  
And He is the Wise,  
Acquainted with all things."

19\. Say: "What thing is most  
Weighty in evidence?"  
Say: "God is witness  
Between me and you;  
This Qur-ān hath been  
Revealed to me by inspiration,  
That I may warn you  
And all whom it reaches.  
Can ye possibly bear witness  
That besides God there is  
Another God?" Say:  
"Nay! I cannot bear witness!"  
Say: But in truth  
He is the One God,

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

And I truly am innocent  
Of (your blasphemy of) joining  
Others with Him."

20\. Those to whom  
We have given the Book  
Know this as they know  
Their own sons.  
Those who have lost  
Their own souls  
Refuse therefore to believe.

##### SECTION 3.

21\. Who doth more wrong  
Than he who inventeth  
A lie against God  
Or rejecteth His Signs?  
But verily the wrong-doers  
Never shall prosper.

22\. One day shall We gather  
Them all together: We  
Shall say to those  
Who ascribed partners (to Us):  
"Where are the partners  
Whom ye (invented  
And) talked about?"

23\. There will then be (left)  
No subterfuge for them  
But to say: "By God  
Our Lord, we were not  
Those who joined gods  
With God."

24\. Behold! how they lie  
Against their own souls!

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

But the (lie) which they  
Invented will leave themes:  
In the lurch.

25\. Of them there are some  
Who (pretend to) listen to thee;  
But We have thrown  
Veils on their hearts,  
So they understand it not,  
And deafness in their ears;  
If they saw every one  
Of the Signs, not they  
Will believe in them;  
In so much that  
When they come to thee,  
They (but) dispute with thee;  
The Unbelievers say:  
"These are nothing  
But tales of the ancients."

26\. Others they keep away from it,  
And themselves they keep away;  
But they only destroy  
Their own souls,  
And they perceive it not.

27\. If thou couldst but see  
When they are confronted  
With the Fire!  
They will say:  
"Would that we were  
But sent back!  
Then would we not reject  
The Signs of our Lord,  
But would be amongst those  
Who believe!"

28\. Yea, in their own (eyes)  
Will become manifest  
What before they concealed.  
But if they were returned,  
They would certainly relapse  
To the things they were forbidden,

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

For they are indeed liars.

29\. And they (sometimes) say:  
"There is nothing except  
Our life on this earth,  
And never shall we be  
Raised up again."

30\. If thou couldst but see  
When they are confronted  
With their Lord!  
He will say:  
"Is not this the truth?"  
They will say:  
"Yea, by our Lord!"  
He will say:  
"Taste ye then the Penalty,  
Because ye rejected Faith."

##### SECTION 4.

31\. Lost indeed are they  
Who treat it as a falsehood  
That they must meet God,  
Until on a sudden  
The hour is on them,  
And they say: "Ah! woe  
Unto us that we took  
No thought of it";  
For they bear their burdens  
On their backs,

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

And evil indeed are  
The burdens that they bear?

32\. What is the life of this world  
But play and amusement? ess  
But best is the Home  
In the Hereafter, for those  
Who are righteous.  
Will ye not then understand?

33\. We know indeed the grief  
Which their words do cause thee:  
It is not thee they reject:  
It is the Signs of God,  
Which the wicked contemn.

34\. Rejected were the Apostles  
Before thee: with patience  
And constancy they bore  
Their rejection and their wrongs,  
Until Our aid did reach  
Them: there is none  
That can alter the Words  
(And Decrees) of God.  
Already hast thou received  
Some account of those Apostles.

35\. If their spurning is hard  
On thy mind, yet if  
Thou wert able to seek  
A tunnel in the ground  
Or a ladder to the skies  
And bring them a Sign,—  
(What good?). If it were  
God's Will, He could  
Gather them together  
Unto true guidance:

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

So be not thou  
Amongst those who are swayed  
By ignorance (and impatience)!

36\. Those who listen (in truth),  
Be sure, will accept:  
As to the dead, God will  
Raise them up; then will they  
Be turned unto Him.

37\. Whey say: "Why is not  
A Sign sent down  
To him from his Lord?"  
Say: "God hath certainly  
Power to send down a Sign:  
But most of them  
Understand not."

38\. There is not an animal  
(That lives) on the earth,  
Nor a being that flies  
On its wings, but (forms  
Part of) communities like you.  
Nothing have we omitted  
From the Book, and they (all)  
Shall be gathered to their Lord  
In the end.

39\. Those who reject our Signs  
Are deaf and dumb,—

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

In the midst of darkness  
Profound: whom God willeth,  
He leaveth to wander:  
Whom He willeth, He placeth  
On the Way that is Straight.

40\. Say: "Think ye to yourselves,  
If there come upon you  
The Wrath of God,  
Or the Hour (that ye dread),  
Would ye then call upon  
Other than God?—  
(Reply) if ye are truthful!

41\. "Nay,—On Him would ye  
Call, and if it be  
His Will, He would remove  
(The distress) which occasioned  
Your call upon Him,  
And ye would forget  
(The false gods) which ye  
Join with Him!"

##### SECTION 5.

42\. Before thee We sent  
(Apostles) to many nations,  
And We afflicted the nations  
With suffering and adversity,  
That they might learn humility.

43\. When the suffering reached  
Them from Us, why then  
Did they not learn humility?  
On the contrary their hearts  
Became hardened, and Satan  
Made their (sinful) acts  
Seem alluring to them.

44\. But when they forgot  
The warning they had received,

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

We opened to them the gates  
Of all (good) things,  
Until, in the midst  
Of their enjoyment  
Of our gifts,  
On a sudden, We called  
Them to account, when lo!  
They were plunged in despair!

45\. Of the wrong-doers the last  
Remnant was cut off.  
Praise be to God,  
The Cherisher of the Worlds.

46\. Say:"Think ye, if God  
Took away your hearing  
And your sight, and sealed up  
Your hearts, who—a god  
Other than God—could  
Restore them to you?"  
See how We explain  
The Signs by various (symbols);  
Yet they turn aside.

47\. Say:"Think ye, if  
The Punishment of God  
Comes to you,  
Whether suddenly or openly,  
Will any be destroyed  
Except those who do wrong?

48\. We send the apostles  
Only to give good news

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

And to warn: so those  
Who believe and mend  
(Their lives),—upon them  
Shall be no fear,  
Nor shall they grieve.

49\. But those who reject  
Our Signs,—them  
Shall punishment touch,  
For that they ceased not  
From transgressing.

50\. Say:"I tell you not  
That with me  
Are the Treasures of God,  
Nor do I know  
What is hidden,  
Nor do I tell you I am  
An angel. I but follow  
What is revealed to me."  
Say:"Can the blind  
Be held equal to the seeing?"  
Will ye then consider not?

##### SECTION 6.

51\. Give this warning to those  
In whose (hearts) is the fear  
That they will be brought  
(To Judgment) before their Lord:  
Except for Him  
They will have no protector  
Nor intercessor:  
That they may guard  
(Against evil).

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

52\. Send not away those  
Who call on their Lord  
Morning and evening,  
Seeking His Face.  
In naught art thou accountable  
For them, and in naught are they  
Accountable for thee,  
That thou shouldst turn  
Them away, and thus be  
(One) of the unjust.

53\. Thus did We try  
Some of them by comparison  
With others, that they  
Should say:"Is it these  
Then that God hath  
Favoured from amongst us?"  
Doth not God know best  
Those who are grateful?

54\. When those come to thee  
Who believe in Our Signs,  
Say: "Peace be on you:  
Your Lord hath inscribed  
For Himself (the rule  
Of) Mercy: verily,  
If any of you did evil  
In ignorance, and thereafter

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

Repented, and amended  
(His conduct), lo! He is  
Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.

55\. Thus do We explain  
The Signs in detail:  
That the way of the sinners  
May be shown up.

##### SECTION 7.

56\. Say: "I am forbidden  
To worship those—others  
Than God—whom ye  
Call upon." Say: "I will  
Not follow your vain desires:  
If I did, I would stray  
From the path, and be not  
Of the company of those  
Who receive guidance."

57\. Say; "For me, I (work)  
On a clear Sign from my Lord,  
But ye reject Him. What ye  
Would see hastened, is not  
In my power. The Command  
Rests with none but God:  
He declares the Truth,  
And He is the best of judges."

58\. Say: "If what ye would see  
Hastened were in my power,  
The matter would be settled  
At once between you and me.

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

But God knoweth best  
Those who do wrong."

59\. With Him are the keys  
Of the Unseen, the treasures  
That none knoweth but He.  
He knoweth whatever there is  
On the earth and in the sea.  
Not a leaf doth fall  
But with His knowledge:  
There is not a grain  
In the darkness (or depths)  
Of the earth, nor anything  
Fresh or dry (green or withered),  
But is (inscribed) in a Record  
Clear (to those who can read).

60\. It is He Who doth take  
Your souls by night,  
And hath knowledge of all  
That ye have done by day:  
By day doth He raise  
You up again; that a term  
Appointed be fulfilled;  
In the end unto Him  
Will be your return;  
Then will He show you  
The truth of all  
That ye did.

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

##### SECTION 8.

61Ḥe is the Irresistible, (watching)  
From above over His worshippers,  
And He sets guardians  
Over you. At length,  
When death approaches  
One of you, Our angels  
Take his soul, and they  
Never fail in their duty.

62\. Then are men returned  
Unto God, their Protector,  
The (only) Reality:  
Is not His the Command?  
And He is the Swiftest  
In taking account.

63\. Say: "Who is it  
That delivereth you  
From the dark recesses  
Of land and sea,  
When ye call upon Him  
In humility

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

And silent terror:  
If He only delivers us  
From these (dangers),  
(We vow) we shall truly  
Show our gratitude?"

64\. Say: "It is God  
That delivereth you  
From these and all (other)  
Distresses: and yet  
Ye worship false gods!"

65\. Say: "He hath power  
To send calamities  
On you, from above  
And below, or to cover  
You with confusion  
In party strife,  
Giving you a taste  
Of mutual vengeance—  
Each from the other."  
See how We explain  
The Signs by various (symbols);  
That they may understand.

66\. But thy people reject  
This, though it is  
The Truth. Say: "Not mine  
Is the responsibility  
For arranging your affairs;

67\. For every Message  
Is a limit of time,  
And soon shall ye  
Know it."

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

68\. When thou seest men  
Engaged in vain discourse  
About Our Signs, turn  
Away from them unless  
They turn to a different  
Theme. If Satan ever  
Makes thee forget, then  
After recollection, sit not  
Thou in the company  
Of those who do wrong.

69\. On their account  
No responsibility  
Falls on the righteous,  
But (their duty)  
Is to remind them,  
That they may (learn  
To) fear God.

70\. Leave alone those  
Who take their religion  
To be mere play  
And amusement,  
And are deceived  
By the life of this world.  
But proclaim (to them)  
This (truth): that every soul  
Delivers itself to ruin  
By its own acts:  
It will find for itself  
No protector or intercessor  
Except God: if it offered  
Every ransom, (or  
Reparation), none  
Will be accepted: such is  
(The end of) those who  
Deliver themselves to ruin  
By their own acts:  
They will have for drink  
(Only) boiling water,

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

And for punishment,  
One most grievous:  
For they persisted  
In rejecting God.

##### SECTION 9.

71\. Say: "Shall we indeed  
Call on others besides God,  
Things that can do us  
Neither good nor harm,—  
And turn on our heels  
After receiving guidance  
From God?—like one  
Whom the evil ones  
Have made into a fool,  
Wandering bewildered  
Through the earth, his friends  
Calling 'Come to us',  
(Vainly) guiding him to the Path."

Say: "God's guidance  
Is the (only) guidance,  
And we have been directed  
To submit ourselves  
To the Lord of the worlds;—

72\. "To establish regular prayers  
And to fear God:  
For it is to Him  
That we shall be  
Gathered together."

73\. It is He Who created  
The heavens and the earth  
In true (proportions):  
The day He saith, "Be,"

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

Behold! it is. His Word  
Is the Truth. His will be  
The dominion the day  
The trumpet will be blown.  
He knoweth the Unseen  
As well as that which is  
Open. For He  
Is the Wise, well acquainted  
(With all things).

74\. Lo! Abraham said  
To his father Āzar:  
"Takest thou idols for gods?  
For I see thee  
And thy people  
In manifest error."

75\. So also did We show  
Abraham the power  
And the laws of the heavens  
And the earth, that he  
Might (with understanding)  
Have certitude.

76\. When the night  
Covered him over,  
He saw a star:  
He said: "This is my Lord."  
But when it set,  
He said: "I love not  
Those that set."

77\. When he saw the moon  
Rising in splendour,  
He said: "This is my Lord."  
But when the moon set,

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

He said: "Unless my Lord  
Guide me, I shall surely  
Be among those  
Who go astray.

78\. When he saw the sun  
Rising in splendour,  
He said: "This is my Lord;  
This is the greatest (of all)."  
But when the sun set,  
He said: "O my people!  
I am indeed free  
From your (guilt)  
Of giving partners to God.

79\. "For me, I have set  
My face, firmly and truly,  
Towards Him Who created  
The heavens and the earth,  
And never shall I give  
Partners to God."

80\. His people disputed  
With him. He said:  
"(Come) ye to dispute  
With me, about God,  
When He (Himself)  
Hath guided me?  
I fear not (the beings)  
Ye associate with God:

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

Unless my Lord willeth,  
(Nothing can happen).  
My Lord comprehendeth  
In His knowledge all things.  
Will ye not (yourselves)  
Be admonished?

81\. "How should I fear  
(The beings) ye associate  
With God, when ye  
Fear not to give partners  
To God without any warrant  
Having been given to you?  
Which of (us) two parties  
Hath more right to security?  
(Tell me) if ye know.

82\. "It is those who believe  
And confuse not their beliefs  
With wrong—that are  
(Truly) in security, for they  
Are on (right) guidance."

##### SECTION 10.

83\. That was the reasoning  
About Us, which  
We gave to Abraham  
(To use) against his people:

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

We raise whom We will,  
Degree after degree:  
For thy Lord is full  
Of wisdom and knowledge.

84\. We gave him Isaac  
And Jacob: all (three)  
We guided:  
And before him,  
We guided Noah,  
And among his progeny,  
David, Solomon, Job,  
Joseph, Moses, and Aaron:  
Thus do We reward  
Those who do good:

85\. And Zakarīya and John,  
And Jesus and Elias:  
All in the ranks  
Of the Righteous:

86\. And Ismā’īl and Elisha,  
And Jonas, and Lot:

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

And to all We gave  
Favour above the nations:

87\. (To them) and to their fathers,  
And progeny and brethren:  
We chose them,  
And We guided them  
To a straight Way.

88\. This is the Guidance  
Of God: He giveth  
That guidance to whom  
He pleaseth, of His worshippers.  
If they were to join  
Other gods with Him,  
All that they did  
Would be vain for them,

89\. These were the men  
To whom We gave  
The Book, and Authority,  
And Prophethood: if these  
(Their descendants) reject them,  
Behold! We shall entrust  
Their charge to a new People  
Who reject them not.

90\. Those were the (prophets)  
Who received God's guidance:  
Copy the guidance they received;  
Say: "No reward for this  
Do I ask of you:  
This is no less than  
A Message for the nations."

##### SECTION 11.

91\. No just estimate of God  
Do they make when they say:

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

"Nothing doth God send down  
To man (by way of revelation)":  
Say: "Who then sent down  
The Book which Moses brought?—  
A light and guidance to man:  
But ye make it into  
(Separate) sheets for show,  
While ye conceal much  
(Of its contents): therein  
Were ye taught that  
Which ye knew not  
Neither ye nor your fathers."  
Say: "God (sent it down)":  
Then leave them to plunge  
In vain discourse and trifling.

92\. And this is a Book  
Which We have sent down,  
Bringing blessings, and confirming  
(The revelations) which came  
Before it: that thou  
Mayest warn the Mother  
Of Cities and all around her.  
Those who believe  
In the Hereafter  
Believe in this (Book),  
And they are constant  
In guarding their Prayers.

93\. Who can be more wicked  
Than one who inventeth

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

A lie against God,  
Or saith, "I have  
Received inspiration,"  
When he hath received  
None, or (again) who saith,  
"I can reveal the like  
Of what God hath revealed"?  
If thou couldst but see  
How the wicked (do fare)  
In the flood of confusion  
At death!—the angels  
Stretch forth their hands,  
(Saying), "Yield up your souls:  
This day shall ye receive  
Your reward,—a penalty  
Of shame, for that ye used  
To tell lies against God,  
And scornfully to reject  
Of His Signs!"

94\. "And behold! ye come  
To Us bare and alone  
As We created you  
For the first time:  
Ye have left behind you  
All (the favours) which  
We bestowed on you:  
We see not with you  
Your intercessors  
Whom ye thought to be  
Partners in your affairs:  
So now all relations  
Between you have been  
Cut off, and your (pet) fancies  
Have left you in the lurch!

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

##### SECTION 12.

95\. It is God Who causeth  
The seed-grain  
And the date-stone  
To split and sprout.  
He causeth the living  
To issue from the dead,  
And He is the One  
To cause the dead  
To issue from the living.  
That is God: then how  
Are ye deluded  
Away from the truth?

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

96\. He it is that cleaveth  
The day-break (from the dark):  
He makes the night  
For rest and tranquillity,  
And the sun and moon  
For the reckoning (of time):  
Such is the judgment  
And ordering of (Him),  
The Exalted in Power,  
The Omniscient.

97\. It is He Who maketh  
The stars (as beacons) for you,  
That ye may guide yourselves,  
With their help,  
Through the dark spaces  
Of land and sea:  
We detail Our Signs  
For people who know.

98\. It is He Who hath  
Produced you  
From a single person:  
Here is a place of sojourn  
And a place of departure:  
We detail Our signs  
For people who understand.

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

99\. It is He Who sendeth down  
Rain from the skies:  
With it We produce  
Vegetation of all kinds:  
From some We produce  
Green (crops), out of which  
We produce grain,  
Heaped up (at harvest);  
Out of the date-palm  
And its sheaths (or spathes)  
(Come) clusters of dates  
Hanging low and near:  
And (then there are) gardens  
Of grapes, and olives,  
And pomegranates,  
Each similar (in kind)  
Yet different (in variety):  
When they begin to bear fruit,  
Feast your eyes with the fruit  
And the ripeness thereof.  
Behold! in these things  
There are Signs for people  
Who believe.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

100.Yet they make  
The Jinns equals  
With God, though God  
Did create the Jinns;  
And they falsely,  
Having no knowledge,  
Attribute to Him  
Sons and daughters.  
Praise and glory be  
To Him! (for He is) above  
What they attribute to Him!

##### SECTION 13.

101\. To Him is due  
The primal origin  
Of the heavens and the earth:  
How can He have a son  
When He hath no consort?  
He created all things,  
And He hath full knowledge  
Of all things.

102\. That is God, your Lord!  
There is no god but He,  
The Creator of all things:  
Then worship ye Him:  
And He hath power  
To dispose of all affairs.

103\. No vision can grasp Him,  
But His grasp is over

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

All vision: He is  
Above all comprehension,  
Yet is acquainted with all things.

104\. "Now have come to you,  
From your Lord, proofs  
(To open your eyes):  
If any will see,  
It will be for (the good  
Of) his own soul;  
If any will be blind,  
It will be to his own  
(Harm): I am not (here)  
To watch over your doings.

105\. Thus do We explain  
The Signs by various (symbols):  
That they may say,  
"Thou hast taught (us) diligently,"  
And that We may make  
The matter clear  
To those who know.

106\. Follow what thou art taught  
By inspiration from thy Lord:  
There is no god but He:  
And turn aside from those  
Who join gods with God.

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

107\. If it had been God's Plan,  
They would not have taken  
False gods: but We  
Made thee not one  
To watch over their doings,  
Nor art thou set  
Over them to dispose  
Of their affairs.

108\. Revile not ye  
Those whom they call upon  
Besides God, lest  
They out of spite  
Revile God  
In their ignorance.  
Thus have We made  
Alluring to each people'  
Its own doings.  
In the end will they  
Return to their Lord,  
And We shall then

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

Tell them the truth  
Of all that they did.

109\. They swear their strongest  
Oaths by God, that if  
A (special) Sign came  
To them, by it they would  
Believe. Say: "Certainly  
(All) Signs are in the power  
Of God: but what will  
Make you (Muslims) realise  
That (even) if (special) Signs  
Came, they will not believe."?

110\. We (too) shall turn  
To (confusion) their hearts  
And their eyes, even as they  
Refused to believe in this  
In the first instance:  
We shall leave them  
In their trespasses,  
To wander in distraction.

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

##### SECTION 14.

111\. Even if We did send  
Unto them angels,  
And the dead did speak  
Unto them, and We gathered  
Together all things before  
Their very eyes, they are not  
The ones to believe,  
Unless it is in God's Plan.  
But most of them  
Ignore (the truth).

112\. Likewise did We make  
For every Messenger  
An enemy,—evil ones  
Among men and Jinns,  
Inspiring each other  
With flowery discourses  
By way of deception.  
If thy Lord had so planned,  
They would not have  
Done it: so leave them  
And their inventions alone.

113\. To such (deceit)  
Let the hearts of those  
Incline, who have no faith  
In the Hereafter: let them  
Delight in it, and let them  
Earn from it what they may

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

114\. Say: "Shall I seek  
For judge other than God?—  
When He it is  
Who hath sent unto you  
The Book, explained in detail."  
They know full well,  
To whom We have given  
The Book, that it hath been  
Sent down from thy Lord  
In truth. Never be then  
Of those who doubt.

115\. The Word of thy Lord  
Doth find its fulfilment  
In truth and in justice:  
None can change His Words:  
For He is the one Who  
Heareth and knoweth all.

116\. Wert thou to follow  
The common run of those  
On earth, they will lead  
Thee away from the Way  
Of God. They follow  
Nothing but conjecture: they  
Do nothing but lie.

117\. Thy Lord knoweth best  
Who strayeth from His Way:  
He knoweth best  
Who they are that receive  
His guidance.

118\. So eat of (meats)  
On which God's name  
Hath been pronounced,  
If ye have faith  
In His Signs.

119\. Why should ye not  
Eat of (meats) on which  
God's name hath been  
Pronounced, when He hath  
Explained to you in detail  
What is forbidden to you—

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

Except under compulsion  
Of necessity?  
But many do mislead (men)  
By their appetites unchecked  
By knowledge. Thy Lord  
Knoweth best those who transgress

120\. Eschew all sin,  
Open or secret:  
Those who earn sin  
Will get due recompense  
For their "earnings."

121\. Eat not of (meats)  
On which God's name  
Hath not been pronounced:  
That would be impiety.  
But the evil ones  
Ever inspire their friends  
To contend with you  
If ye were to obey them,  
Ye would indeed be Pagans.

##### SECTION 15.

122\. Can he who was dead,  
To whom We gave life,  
And a Light whereby  
He can walk amongst men,  
Be like him who is  
In the depths of darkness,  
From which he can  
Never come out?  
Thus to those without Faith  
Their own deeds seem pleasing.

123\. Thus have We placed  
Leaders in every town,

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

Its wicked men, to plot  
(And burrow) therein:  
But they only plot  
Against their own souls,  
And they perceive it not.

124\. When there comes to them  
A Sign (from God),  
They say: "We shall not  
Believe until we receive  
One (exactly) like those  
Received by God's apostles."  
God knoweth best where  
(And how) to carry out  
His mission. Soon  
Will the wicked  
Be overtaken by  
Humiliation before God,  
And a severe punishment,  
For all their plots.

125\. Those whom God (in His Plan)  
Willeth to guide,—He openeth  
Their breast to Islam;  
Those whom He willeth  
To leave straying,—He maketh  
Their breast close and constricted,  
As if they had to climb  
Up to the skies: thus  
Doth God (heap) the penalty  
On those who refuse to believe.

126\. This is the Way  
Of thy Lord, leading straight:

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

We have detailed the Signs  
For those who  
Receive admonition.

127\. For them will be a Home  
Of Peace in the presence  
Of their Lord: He will be  
Their Friend, because  
They practised (righteousness).

128\. One day will He gather  
Them all together, (and say):  
"O ye assembly of Jinns!  
Much (toll) did ye take  
Of men." Their friends  
Amongst men will say:  
"Our Lord! we made profit no  
From each other: but (alas!)  
We reached our term—  
Which Thou didst appoint  
For us." He will say:  
"The Fire be your dwelling-place:  
You will dwell therein for ever,  
Except as God willeth."  
For thy Lord is full  
Of wisdom and knowledge.

129\. Thus do We make  
The wrong-doers turn  
To each other, because  
Of what they earn.

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

##### SECTION 16.

130\. "O ye assembly of Jinns  
And men! came there not  
Unto you apostles from amongst you  
Setting forth unto you  
My Signs, and warning you  
Of the meeting of this Day  
Of yours?" They will say:  
"We bear witness against  
Ourselves." It was  
The life of this world  
That deceived them. So  
Against themselves will they  
Bear witness that they  
Rejected Faith.

131\. (The apostles were sent) thus,  
For thy Lord would not  
Destroy for their wrong-doing  
Men's habitations whilst  
Their occupants were unwarned.

132\. To all are degrees (or ranks)  
According to their deeds:  
For thy Lord  
Is not unmindful  
Of anything that they do.

133\. Thy Lord is Self-sufficient,  
Full of Mercy: if it were  
His Will, He could destroy  
You, and in your place  
Appoint whom He will  
As your successors, even as  
He raised you up  
From the posterity  
Of other people.

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

134\. All that hath been  
Promised unto you  
Will come to pass:  
Nor can ye frustrate it  
(In the least bit).

135\. Say: "O my people!  
Do whatever ye can:  
I will do (my part):  
Soon will ye know  
Who it is whose end  
Will be (best) in the Hereafter:  
Certain it is that  
The wrong-doers will not prosper."

136\. Out of what God  
Hath produced in abundance  
In tilth and in cattle,  
They assigned Him a share:  
They say, according to their fancies:  
"This is for God, and this"—  
For Our "partners"!  
But the share of their "partners"  
Reacheth not God, whilst  
The share of God reacheth  
Their "partners"! Evil  
(And unjust) is their assignment!

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

137\. Even so, in the eyes  
Of most of the Pagans,  
Their "partners" made alluring  
The slaughter of their children,  
In order to lead them  
To their own destruction,  
And cause confusion  
In their religion.  
If God had willed,  
They would not have done so:  
But leave alone  
Them and their inventions.

138\. And they say that  
Such and such cattle and crops  
Are taboo, and none should  
Eat of them except those  
Whom—so they say—We  
Wish; further, there are  
Cattle forbidden to yoke  
Or burden, and cattle  
On which, (at slaughter),  
The name of God is not  
Pronounced;—inventions  
Against God's name: soon  
Will He requite them  
For their inventions.

139\. They say: "What is  
In the wombs of  
Such and such cattle  
Is specially reserved  
(For food) for our men,  
And forbidden to our women;  
But if it is still-born,  
Then all have shares therein.

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

For their (false) attribution  
(Of superstitions to God),  
He will soon punish them:  
For He is full  
Of wisdom and knowledge.

140\. Lost are those who slay  
Their children, from folly,  
Without knowledge, and forbid  
Food which God hath provided  
For them, inventing (lies)  
Against God. They have  
Indeed gone astray  
And heeded no guidance.

##### SECTION 17.

141\. It is He who produceth  
Gardens, with trellises  
And without, and dates,  
And tilth with produce  
Of all kinds, and olives  
And pomegranates,  
Similar (in kind)  
And different (in variety):  
Eat of their fruit  
In their season, but render  
The dues that are proper  
On the day that the harvest  
Is gathered. But waste not  
By excess: for God  
Loveth not the wasters.

142\. Of the cattle are some  
For burden and some for meat:

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

Eat what God hath provided  
For you, and follow not  
The footsteps of Satan:  
For he is to you  
An avowed enemy.

143\. (Take) eight (head of cattle)  
In (four) pairs:  
Of sheep a pair,  
And of goats a pair;  
Say, hath He forbidden  
The two males,  
Or the two females,  
Or (the young) which the wombs  
Of the two females enclose?  
Tell me with knowledge  
If ye are truthful:

144\. Of camels a pair,  
And of oxen a pair;  
Say, hath He forbidden  
The two males,  
Or the two females,  
Or (the young) which the wombs  
Of the two females enclose?—  
Were ye present when God  
Ordered you such a thing?  
But who doth more wrong  
Than one who invents  
A lie against God,  
To lead astray men  
Without knowledge?  
For God guideth not  
People who do wrong

##### SECTION 18.

145\. Say: "I find not  
In the Message received  
By me by inspiration  
Any (meat) forbidden  
To be eaten by one  
Who wishes to eat it,  
Unless it be dead meat,  
Or blood poured forth,

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

Or the flesh of swine,—  
For it is an abomination—  
Or, what is impious, (meat)  
On which a name has been  
Invoked, other than God's."  
But (even so), if a person  
Is forced by necessity,  
Without wilful disobedience,  
Nor transgressing due limits,—  
Thy Lord is Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

146\. For those who followed  
The Jewish Law, We forbade  
Every (animal) with  
Undivided hoof,  
And We forbade them  
The fat of the ox  
And the sheep, except  
What adheres to their backs  
Or their entrails,  
Or is mixed up  
With a bone:  
This in recompense  
For their wilful disobedience:  
For We are True  
(In Our ordinances).

147\. If they accuse thee  
Of falsehood, say:  
"Your Lord is full  
Of mercy all-embracing;  
But from people in guilt  
Never will His wrath  
Be turned back.

148\. Those who give partners  
(To God) will say:

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

"If God had wished,  
We should not have  
Given partners to Him,  
Nor would our fathers;  
Nor should we have had  
Any taboos." So did  
Their ancestors argue  
Falsely, until they tasted  
Of Our wrath. Say:  
"Have ye any (certain)  
Knowledge? If so, produce  
It before us. Ye follow  
Nothing but conjecture:  
Ye do nothing but lie."

149\. Say: "With God is the argument  
That reaches home: if it had  
Been His Will, He could  
Indeed have guided you all."

150\. Say: "Bring forward your witnesses  
To prove that God did  
Forbid so and so." If they  
Bring such witnesses,  
Be not thou amongst them:  
Nor follow thou the vain  
Desires of such as treat  
Our Signs as falsehoods,  
And such as believe not  
In the Hereafter: for they  
Hold others as equal  
With their Guardian-Lord.

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

##### SECTION 19.

151\. Say: "Come, I will rehearse  
What God hath (really)  
Prohibited you from": join not  
Anything as equal with Him;  
Be good to your parents;  
Kill not your children  
On a plea of want;—We  
Provide sustenance for you  
And for them;—come not  
Nigh to shameful deeds,  
Whether open or secret;  
Take not life, which God  
Hath made sacred, except  
By way of justice and law:  
Thus doth He command you,  
That ye may learn wisdom.

152\. And come not nigh  
To the orphan's property,  
Except to improve it,  
Until he attain the age  
Of full strength; give measure  
And weight with (full) justice;—  
No burden do We place  
On any soul, but that  
Which it can bear;—  
Whenever ye speak, speak justly,

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

Even if a near relative  
Is concerned; and fulfil  
The Covenant of God:  
Thus doth He command you,  
That ye may remember.

153\. Verily, this is My Way,  
Leading straight: follow it:  
Follow not (other) paths:  
They will scatter you about  
From His (great) Path:  
Thus doth He command you,  
That ye may be righteous.

154\. Moreover, We gave Moses  
The Book, completing  
(Our favour) to those  
Who would do right,  
And explaining all things  
In detail,—and a guide  
And a mercy, that they  
Might believe in the meeting  
With their Lord.

##### SECTION 20.

155\. And this is a Book  
Which We have revealed  
As a blessing: so follow it  
And be righteous, that ye  
May receive mercy:

156\. Lest ye should say:  
"The Book was sent down  
To two Peoples before us,  
And for our part, we  
Remained unacquainted

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

With all that they learned  
By assiduous study;"

157\. Or lest ye should say:  
"If the Book had only  
Been sent down to us,  
We should have followed  
Its guidance better than they."  
Now then hath come  
Unto you a Clear (Sign)  
From your Lord,—and a guide  
And a mercy: then who  
Could do more wrong  
Than one who rejecteth  
God's Signs, and turneth  
Away therefrom? In good time  
Shall We requite those  
Who turn away from Our Signs,  
With a dreadful penalty,  
For their turning away.

158\. Are they waiting to see  
If the angels come to them,  
Or thy Lord (Himself),  
Or certain of the Signs  
Of thy Lord!  
The day that certain  
Of the Signs of thy Lord  
Do come, no good  
Will it do to a soul  
To believe in them then,  
If it believed not before  
Nor earned righteousness  
Through its Faith. Say:  
"Wait ye: we too  
Are waiting."

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

159\. As for those who divide  
Their religion and break up  
Into sects, thou hast  
No part in them in the least:  
Their affair is with God:  
He will in the end  
Tell them the truth  
Of all that they did.

160\. He that doeth good  
Shall have ten times  
As much to his credit:  
He that doeth evil  
Shall only be recompensed  
According to his evil:  
No wrong shall be done  
Unto (any of) them.

161\. Say: "Verily, my Lord  
Hath guided me to  
A Way that is straight,—  
A religion of right,  
The Path (trod) by Abraham  
The true in faith,  
And he (certainly)  
Joined not gods with God."

162\. Say: "Truly, my prayer  
And my service of sacrifice,  
My life and my death,  
Are (all) for God,  
The Cherisher of the Worlds:

163\. No partner hath He:  
This am I commanded,  
And I am the first  
Of those who bow  
To His Will.

164\. Say: "Shall I seek  
For (my) Cherisher

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

Other than God,  
When He is the Cherisher  
Of all things (that exist)?  
Every soul draws the meed  
Of its acts on none  
But itself: no bearer  
Of burdens can bear  
The burden of another.  
Your goal in the end  
Is towards God: He will tell  
You the truth of the things  
Wherein ye disputed."

165\. It is He Who hath made  
You (His) agents, inheritors  
Of the earth: He hath raised  
You in ranks, some above  
Others: that He may try you  
In the gifts He hath given you:  
For thy Lord is quick  
In punishment: yet He  
Is indeed Oft-forgiving,  
Most Merciful.
