<p><i>In the name of God, Most Gracious,<br> Most Merciful</i>.</p>  
<p>1. A. L. M.</p>  
<p>2. The Roman Empire<br> Has been defeated&#8212;</p>  
<p>3. In a land close by;<br> But they, (even) after<br> (This) defeat of theirs,<br> Will soon be victorious&#8212;</p>  
<p>4. Within a few years.<br> With God is the Decision,<br> In the Past<br> And in the Future:<br> On that Day shall<br> The Believers rejoice&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_1052"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1052</font></A></p>  
<p>5. With the help of God.<br> He helps whom He will,<br> And He is Exalted in Might,<br> Most Merciful.</p>  
<p>6. (It is) the promise of God.<br> Never does God depart<br> From His promise:<br> But most men understand not.</p>  
<p>7. They know but the outer<br> (Things) in the life<br> Of this world: but<br> Of the End of things<br> They are heedless.</p>  
<p>8. Do they not reflect<br> In their own minds?<br> Not but for just ends<br> And for a term appointed,<br> Did God create the heavens<br> And the earth, and all<br> Between them: yet are there<br> Truly many among men<br> Who deny the meeting<br> With their Lord<br> (At the Resurrection)!</p>  
<p><a name="page_1053"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1053</font></A></p>  
<p>9. Do they not travel<br> Through the earth, and see<br> What was the End<br> Of those before them?<br> They were superior to them<br> In strength: they tilled<br> The soil and populated it<br> In greater numbers than these<br> Have done: there came to them<br> Their apostles with Clear (Signs),<br> (Which they rejected, to their<br> Own destruction): it was not<br> God who wronged them, but<br> They wronged their own souls.</p>  
<p>10. In the long run<br> Evil in the extreme<br> Will be the End of those<br> Who do evil; for that<br> They rejected the Signs<br> Of God, and held them up<br> To ridicule.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 2.</h5>  
<p>11. It is God Who begins<br> (The process of) creation;<br> Then repeats it; then<br> Shall ye be brought back<br> To Him.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1054"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1054</font></A></p>  
<p>12. On the Day that<br> The Hour will be established,<br> The guilty will be<br> Struck dumb with despair.</p>  
<p>13. No intercessor will they have<br> Among their "Partners",<br> And they will (themselves)<br> Reject their "Partners".</p>  
<p>14. On the Day that<br> The Hour will he established,&#8212;<br> That Day shall (all men)<br> Be sorted out.</p>  
<p>15. Then those who have believed<br> And worked righteous deeds,<br> Shall be made happy<br> In a Mead of Delight.</p>  
<p>16. And those who have rejected<br> Faith and falsely denied<br> Our Signs and the meeting<br> Of the Hereafter,&#8212;such<br> Shall be brought forth to<br> Punishment.</p>  
<p>17. So (give) glory to God,<br> When ye reach eventide</p>  
<p><a name="page_1055"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1055</font></A></p>  
<p>And when ye rise<br> In the morning;</p>  
<p>18. Yea, To Him be praise,<br> In the heavens and on earth;<br> And in the late afternoon<br> And when the day<br> Begins to decline.</p>  
<p>19. It is He Who brings out<br> The living from the dead,<br> And brings out the dead<br> From the living, and Who<br> Gives life to the earth<br> After it is dead:<br> And thus shall ye be<br> Brought out (from the dead).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 3.</h5>  
<p>20. Among His Signs is this,<br> That He created you</p>  
<p><a name="page_1056"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1056</font></A></p>  
<p>From dust; and then,&#8212;<br> Behold, ye are men<br> Scattered (far and wide)!</p>  
<p>21. And among His Signs<br> Is this, that He created<br> For you mates from among<br> Yourselves, that ye may<br> Dwell in tranquillity with them,<br> And He has put love<br> And mercy between your (hearts):<br> Verily in that are Signs<br> For those who reflect.</p>  
<p>22. And among His Signs<br> Is the creation of the heavens<br> And the earth, and the variations<br> In your languages<br> And your colours: verily<br> In that are Signs<br> For those who know.</p>  
<p>23. And among His Signs<br> Is the sleep that ye take<br> By night and by day,<br> And the quest that ye</p>  
<p><a name="page_1057"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1057</font></A></p>  
<p>(Make for livelihood)<br> Out of His Bounty: verily<br> In that are Signs<br> For those who hearken.</p>  
<p>24. And among His Signs,<br> He shows you the lightning,<br> By way both of fear<br> And of hope, and He sends<br> Down rain from the sky<br> And with it gives life to<br> The earth after it is dead:<br> Verily in that are Signs<br> For those who are wise.</p>  
<p>25. And among His Signs is this,<br> That heaven and earth<br> Stand by His Command:<br> Then when He calls you,<br> By a single call, from the earth,<br> Behold, ye (straightway) come forth.</p>  
<p><a name="page_1058"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1058</font></A></p>  
<p>26. To Him belongs every being<br> That is in the heavens<br> And on earth: all are<br> Devoutly obedient to Him.</p>  
<p>27. It is He Who begins<br> (The process of) creation;<br> Then repeats it; and<br> For Him it is most easy.<br> To Him belongs the loftiest<br> Similitude (we can think of)<br> In the heavens and the earth:<br> For He is Exalted in Might,<br> Full of wisdom.</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 4.</h5>  
<p>28. He does propound<br> To you a similitude<br> From your own (experience):<br> Do ye have partners<br> Among those whom your right hands<br> Possess, to share as equals<br> In the wealth We have</p>  
<p><a name="page_1059"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1059</font></A></p>  
<p>Bestowed on you? Do ye<br> Fear them as ye fear<br> Each other? Thus do We<br> Explain the Signs in detail<br> To a people that understand.</p>  
<p>29. Nay, the wrong-doers (merely)<br> Follow their own lusts,<br> Being devoid of knowledge.<br> But who will guide those<br> Whom God leaves astray?<br> To them there will be<br> No helpers.</p>  
<p>30. So set thou thy face<br> Steadily and truly to the Faith:<br> (Establish) God's handiwork according<br> To the pattern on which<br> He has made mankind:<br> No change (let there be)<br> In the work (wrought)</p>  
<p><a name="page_1060"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1060</font></A></p>  
<p>By God: that is<br> The standard Religion<br> But most among mankind<br> Understand not.</p>  
<p>31. Turn ye back in repentance<br> To Him, and fear Him:<br> Establish regular prayers,<br> And be not ye among those<br> Who join gods with God,&#8212;</p>  
<p>32. Those who split up<br> Their Religion, and become<br> (Mere) Sects,&#8212;each party<br> Rejoicing in that which<br> Is with itself!</p>  
<p>33. When trouble touches men,<br> They cry to their Lord,<br> Turning back to Him<br> In repentance: but when<br> He gives them a taste<br> Of Mercy as from Himself,<br> Behold, some of them<br> Pay part-worship to<br> Other god's besides their Lord,&#8212;</p>  
<p>34. (As if) to show their ingratitude<br> For the (favours) We have<br> Bestowed on them! Then enjoy<br> (Your brief day); but soon</p>  
<p><a name="page_1061"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1061</font></A></p>  
<p>Will ye know (your folly).</p>  
<p>35. Or have We sent down<br> Authority to them, which<br> Points out to them<br> The things to which<br> They pay part-worship?</p>  
<p>36. When We give men<br> A taste of Mercy,<br> They exult thereat:<br> And when-some evil<br> Afflicts them because of<br> What their (own) hands<br> Have sent forth, behold,<br> They are in despair!</p>  
<p>37. See they not that God<br> Enlarges the provision and<br> Restricts it, to whomsoever<br> He pleases? Verily in that<br> Are Signs for those who believe.</p>  
<p>38. So give what is due<br> To kindred, the needy,<br> And the wayfarer.<br> That is best for those</p>  
<p><a name="page_1062"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1062</font></A></p>  
<p>Who seek the Countenance,<br> Of God, and it is they<br> Who will prosper.</p>  
<p>39. That which ye lay out<br> For increase through the property<br> Of (other) people, will have<br> No increase with God:<br> But that which ye lay out<br> For charity, seeking<br> The Countenance of God,<br> (Will increase): it is<br> These who twill get<br> A recompense multiplied.</p>  
<p>40. It is God Who has<br> Created you: further, He has<br> Provided for your sustenance;<br> Then He will cause you<br> To die; and again He will<br> Give you life. Are there<br> Any of your (false) "Partners"<br> Who can do any single<br> One of these things?<br> Glory to Him! and High<br> Is He above the partners<br> They attribute (to Him)!</p>  
<p><a name="page_1063"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1063</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 5.</h5>  
<p>41. Mischief has appeared<br> On land and sea because<br> Of (the meed) that the hands<br> Of men have earned,<br> That (God) may give them<br> A taste of some of their<br> Deeds: in order that the<br> May turn back (from Evil).</p>  
<p>42. Say: "Travel through the earth<br> And see what was the End<br> Of those before (you):<br> Most of them worshipped<br> Others besides God."</p>  
<p>43. But set thou thy face<br> To the right Religion,<br> Before there come from God<br> The Day which there is</p>  
<p><a name="page_1064"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1064</font></A></p>  
<p>No chance of averting:<br> On that Day shall men<br> Be divided (in two).</p>  
<p>44. Those who reject Faith<br> Will suffer from that rejection:<br> And those who work righteousness<br> Will spread their couch<br> (Of repose) for themselves<br> (In heaven):</p>  
<p>45. That He may reward those<br> Who believe and work righteous<br> Deeds, out of His Bounty.<br> For He loves not those<br> Who reject Faith.</p>  
<p>46. Among His Signs is this,<br> That He sends the Winds,<br> As heralds of Glad Tidings,<br> Giving you a taste<br> Of His (Grace and) Mercy,&#8212;<br> That the ships may sail<br> (Majestically) by His Command<br> And that ye may seek</p>  
<p><a name="page_1065"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1065</font></A></p>  
<p>Of His Bounty: in order<br> That ye may be grateful.</p>  
<p>47. We did indeed send,<br> Before thee, apostles<br> To their (respective) peoples,<br> And they came to them<br> With Clear Signs: then,<br> To those who transgressed,<br> We meted out Retribution:<br> And it was due from us<br> To aid those who believed.</p>  
<p>48. It is God Who sends<br> The Winds, and they raise<br> The Clouds: then does He<br> Spread them in the sky<br> As He wills, and break them<br> Into fragments, until thou seest<br> Rain-drops issue from the midst<br> Thereof: then when He has<br> Made them reach such<br> His servants as He wills,<br> Behold, they do rejoice!&#8212;</p>  
<p>49. Even though, before they received<br> (The rain)&#8212;just before this&#8212;<br> They were dumb with despair!</p>  
<p>50. Then contemplate (O man!)<br> The memorials of God's Mercy!&#8212;<br> How He gives life<br> To the earth after<br> Its death: verily the Same<br> Will give life to the men</p>  
<p><a name="page_1066"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1066</font></A></p>  
<p>Who are dead: for He<br> Has power over all things.</p>  
<p>51. And if We (but) send<br> A Wind from which<br> They see (their tilth)<br> Turn yellow,&#8212;behold,<br> They become, thereafter,<br> Ungrateful (Unbelievers)!</p>  
<p>52. So verily thou canst not<br> Make the dead to hear,<br> Nor canst thou make<br> The deaf to hear<br> The call, when they show<br> Their backs and turn away.</p>  
<p>53. Nor canst thou lead back<br> The blind from their straying:<br> Only those wilt thou make<br> To hear, who believe<br> In Our Signs and submit<br> (Their wills in Islam).</p>  <h5 align="center">SECTION 6.</h5>  
<p>54. It is God Who<br> Created you in a state<br> Of (helpless) weakness, then<br> Gave (you) strength after weakness,</p>  
<p><a name="page_1067"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1067</font></A></p>  
<p>Then, after strength, gave (you)<br> Weakness and a hoary head:<br> He creates as He wills,<br> And it is He Who has<br> All knowledge and power.</p>  
<p>55. On the Day that<br> The Hour (of reckoning)<br> Will be established,<br> The transgressors will swear<br> That they tarried not<br> But an hour: thus were<br> They used to being deluded!</p>  
<p>56. But those endued with knowledge<br> And faith will say:<br> "Indeed ye did tarry,<br> Within God's Decree,<br> To the Day of Resurrection,<br> And this is the Day<br> Of Resurrection: but ye&#8212;<br> Ye were not aware!"</p>  
<p>57. So on that Day no excuse<br> Of theirs will<br> Avail the Transgressors,<br> Nor will they be invited (then)<br> To seek grace (by repentance).</p>  
<p><a name="page_1068"><font size="1" color="green">p. 1068</font></A></p>  
<p>58. Verily We have propounded<br> For men, in this Qur-&#257;n.<br> Every kind of Parable:<br> But if thou bring to them<br> Any Sign, the Unbelievers<br> Are sure to say, "Ye<br> Do nothing but talk vanities."</p>  
<p>59. Thus does God seal up<br> The hearts of those<br> Who understand not.</p>  
<p>60. So patiently persevere: for<br> Verily the promise of God<br> Is true: nor let those<br> Shake thy firmness, who have<br> (Themselves) no certainty of faith.</p>
