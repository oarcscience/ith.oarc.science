### Sūra XVI.

### *Naḥl* or The Bee.

*In the name of God Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. (Inevitable) cometh (to pass)  
The Command of God:  
Seek ye not then  
To hasten it: glory to Him,  
And far is He above  
Having the partners  
They ascribe unto Him!

2\. He doth send down His angels  
With inspiration of His Command,  
To such of His servants  
As He pleaseth, (saying):  
"Warn (Man) that there is  
No god but I: so do  
Your duty unto Me."

3\. He has created the heavens  
And the earth for just ends:  
Far is He above having  
The partners they ascribe to Him!

4\. He has created man  
From a sperm-drop;  
And behold this same (man)  
Becomes an open disputer!

<span id="page_657">p. 657</span>

5\. And cattle He has created  
For you (men): from them  
Ye derive warmth,  
And numerous benefits,  
And of their (meat) ye eat.

6\. And ye have a sense  
Of pride and beauty in them  
As ye drive them home  
In the evening, and as ye  
Lead them forth to pasture  
In the morning.

7\. And they carry your heavy loads  
To lands that ye could not  
(Otherwise) reach except with  
Souls distressed: for your Lord  
Is indeed Most Kind, Most Merciful

8\. And (He has created) horses,  
Mules, and donkeys, for you  
To ride and use for show;  
And He has created (other) things  
Of which ye have no knowledge.

<span id="page_658">p. 658</span>

9\. and unto God leads straight  
The Way, but there are ways  
That turn aside: if God  
Had willed, He could have  
Guided all of you.

##### SECTION 2.

10\. It is He Who sends down  
Rain from the sky:  
From it ye drink,  
And out of it (grows)  
The vegetation on which  
Ye feed your cattle.

11\. With it He produces  
For you corn, olives,  
Date-palms, grapes,  
And every kind of fruit:  
Verily in this is a Sign  
For those who give thought.

12\. He has made subject to you  
The Night and the Day;  
The Sun and the Moon;  
And the Stars are in subjection  
By His Command: verily  
In this are Signs  
For men who are wise.

<span id="page_659">p. 659</span>

13\. And the things on this earth  
Which He has multiplied  
In varying colours  
(and qualities):  
Verily in this is a Sign  
For men who celebrate  
The praises of God  
(in gratitude).

14\. It is He Who has made  
The sea subject, that ye  
May eat thereof flesh  
That is fresh and tender,  
And that ye may extract  
Therefrom ornaments to wear;  
And thou seest the ships  
Therein that plough the waves,  
That ye may seek (thus)  
Of the bounty of God  
And that ye may be grateful.

<span id="page_660">p. 660</span>

15\. And He has set up  
On the earth mountains  
Standing firm, lest it should  
Shake with you; and rivers  
And roads; that ye  
May guide yourselves;

16\. And marks and sign-posts;  
And by the stars  
(Men) guide themselves.

17\. Is then He Who creates  
Like one that creates not?  
Will ye not receive admonition?

18\. If ye would count up  
The favours of God,  
Never would ye be able  
To number them: for God  
Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

<span id="page_661">p. 661</span>

19\. And God doth know  
What ye conceal,  
And what ye reveal.

20\. Those whom they invoke  
Besides God create nothing  
And are themselves created.

21\. (They are things) dead,  
Lifeless: nor do they know  
When they will be raised up.

##### SECTION 3.

22\. Your God is One God:  
As to those who believe not  
In the Hereafter, their hearts  
Refuse to know, and they  
Are arrogant.

23\. Undoubtedly God doth know  
What they conceal,  
And what they reveal:  
Verily He loveth not the arrogant.

24\. When it is said to them,  
"What is it that your Lord

<span id="page_662">p. 662</span>

Has revealed?" they say,  
"Tales of the ancients!"

25\. Let them bear, on the Day  
Of Judgment, their own burdens  
In full, and also (something)  
Of the burdens of those  
Without knowledge, whom they  
Misled. Alas, how grievous  
The burdens they will bear!

##### SECTION 4.

26\. Those before them did also  
Plot (against God's Way):  
But God took their structures  
From their foundations, and the roof  
Fell down on them from above;  
And the Wrath seized them  
From directions they did not perceive.

27\. Then, on the Day of Judgment,  
He will cover them

<span id="page_663">p. 663</span>

With shame, and say:  
"Where are My "partners"  
Concerning whom ye used  
To dispute (with the godly)?"  
Those endued with knowledge  
Will say: "This Day, indeed,  
Are the Unbelievers covered  
With Shame and Misery,—

28\. "(Namely) those whose lives the angels  
Take in a state of wrong-doing  
To their own souls."  
Then would they offer submission  
(With the pretence), "We did  
No evil (knowingly)." (The angels  
Will reply), "Nay, but verily  
God knoweth all that ye did;

29\. "So enter the gates of Hell,  
To dwell therein.  
Thus evil indeed  
Is the abode of the arrogant."

30\. To the righteous  
(When) it is said, "What  
Is it that your Lord  
Has revealed?" they say,  
"All that is good." To those  
Who do good, there is good  
In this world, and-the Home  
Of the Hereafter is even better

<span id="page_664">p. 664</span>

And excellent indeed is the Home  
Of the righteous,—

31\. Gardens of Eternity which they  
Will enter: beneath them  
Flow (pleasant) rivers: they  
Will have therein all  
That they wish: thus doth  
God reward the righteous,—

32\. (Namely) those whose lives  
The angels take in a state  
Of purity, saying (to them),  
"Peace be on you; enter ye  
The Garden, because of (the good)  
Which ye did (in the world)."

33\. Do the (ungodly) wait until  
The angels come to them,  
Or there comes the Command  
Of thy Lord (for their doom)?  
So did those who went  
Before them. But God  
Wronged them not: nay,  
They wronged their own souls.

34\. But the evil results  
Of their deeds overtook them,  
And that very (Wrath)  
At which they had scoffed  
Hemmed them in.

##### SECTION 5.

35\. The worshippers of false gods  
Say: "If God had so willed,  
We should not have worshipped  
Aught but Him—neither we

<span id="page_665">p. 665</span>

Nor our fathers,—nor should  
We have prescribed prohibitions  
Other than His." So did those  
Who went before them.  
But what is the mission  
Of apostles but to preach  
The Clear Message?

36\. For We assuredly sent  
Amongst every People an apostle,  
(With the Command), "Serve  
God, and eschew Evil":  
Of the people were some whom  
God guided, and some  
On whom Error became  
Inevitably (established). So travel  
Through the earth, and see  
What was the end of those  
Who denied (the Truth).

37\. If thou art anxious  
For their guidance, yet  
God guideth not such  
As He leaves to stray,  
And there is none  
To help them.

38\. They swear their strongest oaths  
By God, that God will not

<span id="page_666">p. 666</span>

Raise up those who die  
Nay, but it is a promise  
(Binding) on Him in truth:  
But most among mankind  
Realise it not.

39\. (They must be raised up),  
In order that He may manifest  
To them the truth of that  
Wherein they differ, and that  
The rejecters of Truth  
May realise that they had  
Indeed (surrendered to)  
Falsehood.

40\. For to anything which We  
Have willed, We but say  
The Word, "Be ", and it is.

##### SECTION 6.

41\. To those who leave  
Their homes in the cause  
Of God, after suffering  
oppression,—  
We will assuredly give  
A goodly home in this world;  
But truly the reward  
Of the Hereafter will be greater.  
If they only realised (this)!

42\. (They are) those who persevere  
In patience, and put  
Their trust on their Lord.

<span id="page_667">p. 667</span>

43\. And before thee also  
The apostles We sent  
Were but men, to whom  
We granted inspiration: if ye  
Realise this not, ask of those  
Who possess the Message.

44\. (We sent them) with Clear Signs  
And Books of dark prophecies;  
And We have sent down  
Unto thee (also) the Message;  
That thou mayest explain clearly  
To men what is sent  
For them, and that they  
May give thought.

45\. Do then those who devise  
Evil (plots) feel secure  
That God will not cause  
the earth to swallow them up,  
Or that the Wrath will not  
Seize them from directions  
They little perceive?—

46\. Or that He may not  
Call them to account

<span id="page_668">p. 668</span>

In the midst of their goings  
To and fro, without a chance  
Of their frustrating Him?—

47\. Or that He may not  
Call them to account  
By a process of slow wastage—  
For thy Lord is indeed  
Full of kindness and mercy.

48\. Do they not look  
At God's creation, (even)  
Among (inanimate) things,—  
How their (very) shadows  
Turn round, from the right  
And the left, prostrating  
Themselves to God, and that  
In the humblest manner?

49\. And to God doth obeisance  
All that is in the heavens  
And on earth, whether  
Moving (living) creatures  
Or the angels: for none  
Are arrogant (before their Lord).

<span id="page_669">p. 669</span>

50\. They all revere their Lord,  
High above them, and they do  
All that they are commanded.

##### SECTION 7.

51\. God has said: "Take not  
(For worship) two gods:  
For He is just One God:  
Then fear Me (and Me alone)."

52\. To Him belongs whatever  
Is in the heavens and on earth,  
And to Him is duty due always:  
Then will ye fear other  
Than God?

53\. And ye have no good thing  
But is from God: and moreover,  
When ye are touched by distress,  
Unto Him ye cry with groans;

<span id="page_670">p. 670</span>

54\. Yet, when He removes  
The distress from you, behold!  
Some of you turn to other gods  
To join with their Lord—

55\. (As if) to show their ingratitude  
For the favours We have  
Bestowed on them! Then enjoy  
(Your brief day); but soon  
Will ye know (your folly)!

56\. And they (even) assign,  
To things they do not know,  
A portion out of that  
Which We have bestowed  
For their sustenance!  
By God, ye shall certainly  
Be called to account  
For your false inventions.

57\. And they assign daughters  
For God!—Glory be to Him!—  
And for themselves (sons,  
The issue) they desire!

58\. When news is brought  
To one of them, of (the birth  
Of) a female (child), his face  
Darkens, and he is filled  
With inward grief!

59\. With shame does he hide  
Himself from his people,

<span id="page_671">p. 671</span>

Because of the bad news  
He has had!  
Shall he retain it  
On (sufferance and) contempt,  
Or bury it in the dust?  
Ah! what an evil (choice)  
They decide on?

60\. To those who believe not  
In the Hereafter, applies  
The similitude of evil:  
To God applies the highest  
Similitude: for He is  
The Exalted in Power,  
Full of Wisdom.

##### SECTION 8.

61\. If God were to punish  
Men for their wrong-doing,  
He would not leave, on the (earth);  
A single living creature:  
But He gives them respite  
For a stated Term:  
When their Term expires,  
They would not be able  
To delay (the punishment)  
For a single hour, just as  
They would not be able  
To anticipate it (for a single hour).

<span id="page_672">p. 672</span>

62\. They attribute to God  
What they hate (for themselves),  
And their tongues assert  
The falsehood that all good things  
Are for themselves: without doubt  
For them is the Fire, and they  
Will be the first to be  
Hastened on into it!

63\. By God, We (also) sent  
(Our apostles) to Peoples  
Before thee; but Satan  
Made, (to the wicked),  
Their own acts seem alluring:  
He is also their patron to-day,  
But they shall have  
A most grievous penalty.

64\. And We sent down the Book  
To thee for the express purpose,  
That thou shouldst make clear  
To them those things in which  
They differ, and that it should he  
A guide and a mercy  
To those who believe.

65\. And God sends down rain  
From the skies, and gives therewith  
Life to the earth after its death:  
Verily in this is a Sign

<span id="page_673">p. 673</span>

For those who listen.

##### SECTION 9.

66\. And verily in cattle (too)  
Will ye find an instructive Sign.  
From what is within their bodies,  
Between excretions and blood,  
We produce, for your drink,  
Milk, pure and agreeable  
To those who drink it.

67\. And from the fruit  
Of the date-palm and the vine,  
Ye get out wholesome drink  
And food: behold, in this  
Also is a Sign  
For those who are wise.

<span id="page_674">p. 674</span>

68\. And thy Lord taught the Bee  
To build its cells in hills,  
On trees, and in (men's) habitations;

69\. Then to eat of all  
The produce (of the earth),  
And find with skill the spacious  
Paths of its Lord: there issues  
From within their bodies  
A drink of varying colours,  
Wherein is healing for men:  
Verily in this is a Sign  
For those who give thought.

70\. It is God Who creates you  
And takes your souls at death;  
And of you there are  
Some who are sent back  
To a feeble age, so that  
They know nothing after  
Having known (much):  
For God is All-Knowing,  
All-Powerful.

<span id="page_675">p. 675</span>

##### SECTION 10.

71\. God has bestowed His gifts  
Of sustenance more freely on some  
Of you than on others: those  
More favoured are not going  
To throw back their gifts  
To those whom their right hands  
Possess, so as to be equal  
In that respect. Will they then  
Deny the favours of God?

72\. And God has made for you  
Mates (and Companions) of your own nature,  
And made for you, out of them,  
Sons and daughters and grandchildren,  
And provided for you sustenance  
Of the best: will they  
Then believe in vain things,  
And be ungrateful for God's favours?—

73\. And worship others than God,—  
Such as have no power  
Of providing them, for sustenance,

<span id="page_676">p. 676</span>

With anything in heavens or earth,  
And cannot possibly have  
Such power?

74\. Invent not similitudes  
For God: for God knoweth,  
And ye know not.

75\. God sets forth the Parable  
(Of two men: one) a slave  
Under the dominion of another;  
He has no power of any sort;  
And (the other) a man  
On whom We have bestowed  
Goodly favours from Ourselves,  
And he spends thereof (freely),  
Privately and publicly:  
Are the two equal?  
(By no means;)  
Praise be to God. But  
Most of them understand not.

76\. God sets forth (another) Parable  
Of two men: one of them  
Dumb, with no power  
Of any sort; a wearisome burden  
Is he to his master;  
Whichever way he directs him,  
He brings no good:  
Is such a man equal  
With one who commands

<span id="page_677">p. 677</span>

Justice, and is on  
A Straight Way?

##### SECTION 11.

77\. To God belongeth the Mystery  
Of the heavens and the earth.  
And the Decision of the Hour  
(Of Judgment) is as  
The twinkling of an eye,  
Or even quicker:  
For God hath power  
Over all things.

78\. It is He Who brought you  
Forth from the wombs  
Of your mothers when  
Ye knew nothing; and He  
Gave you hearing and sight  
And intelligence and affections:  
That ye may give thanks  
(To God).

79\. Do they not look at  
The birds, held poised  
In the midst of (the air  
And) the sky? Nothing  
Holds them up but (the power  
Of) God. Verily in this  
Are Signs for those who believe.

<span id="page_678">p. 678</span>

80\. It is God Who made your habitations  
Homes of rest and quiet  
For you; and made for you,  
Out of the skins of animals,  
(Tents for) dwellings, which  
Ye find so light (and handy)  
When ye travel and when  
Ye stop (in your travels);  
And out of their wool,  
And their soft fibres  
(Between wool and hair),  
And their hair, rich stuff  
And articles of convenience  
(To serve you) for a time.

81\. It is God Who made.  
Out of the things He created,  
Some things to give you shade;  
Of the hills He made some  
For your shelter; He made you  
Garments to protect you  
From heat, and coats of mail  
To protect you from  
Your (mutual) violence.  
Thus does He complete  
His favours on you, that  
Ye may bow to His Will  
(In Islām).

<span id="page_679">p. 679</span>

82\. But if they turn away,  
Thy duty is only to preach  
The Clear Message.

83\. They recognise the favours  
Of God; then they deny them;  
And most of them  
Are (creatures) ungrateful.

##### SECTION 12.

84\. One Day We shall raise  
From all Peoples a Witness:  
Then will no excuse be accepted  
From Unbelievers, nor will they  
Receive any favours.

85\. When the wrong-doers  
(Actually) see the Penalty,  
Then will it in no way  
Be mitigated, nor will they  
Then receive respite.

86\. When those who gave partners  
To God will see their "partners",

<span id="page_680">p. 680</span>

They will say: "Our Lord!  
These are our "partners," those  
Whom we used to invoke  
Besides Thee." But they will  
Throw back their word at them  
(And say): "Indeed ye are liars!"

87\. That day shall they (openly) show  
(Their) submission to God; and all  
Their inventions shall leave  
Them in the lurch.

88\. Those who reject God  
And hinder (men) from the Path  
Of God—for them  
Will We add Penalty  
To Penalty; for that they  
Used to spread mischief.

89\. One day We shall raise  
From all Peoples a witness  
Against them, from amongst themselves:  
And We shall bring thee  
As a witness against these  
(Thy people): and We have sent down  
To thee the Book explaining  
All things, a Guide, a Mercy,  
And Glad Tidings to Muslims.

##### SECTION 13.

90\. God commands justice, the doing  
Of good, and liberality to kith

<span id="page_681">p. 681</span>

And kin, and He forbids  
All shameful deeds, and injustice  
And rebellion: He instructs you,  
That ye may receive admonition.

91\. Fulfil the Covenant of God  
When ye have entered into it,  
And break not your oaths  
After ye have confirmed them;  
Indeed ye have made  
God your surety; for God  
Knoweth all that ye do.

92\. And be not like a woman  
Who breaks into untwisted strands  
The yarn which she has spun,  
After it has become strong  
Nor take your oaths to practise  
Deception between yourselves,  
Lest one party should be  
More numerous than another:  
For God will test you by this;  
And on the Day of Judgment

<span id="page_682">p. 682</span>

He will certainly make clear  
To you (the truth of) that  
Wherein ye disagree.

93\. If God so willed, He  
Could make you all one People:  
But He leaves straying  
Whom He pleases, and He guides  
Whom He pleases: but ye  
Shall certainly be called to account  
For all your actions.

94\. And take not your oaths,  
To practise deception between  
yourselves,  
With the result that someone's foot  
May slip after it was  
Firmly planted, and ye may  
Have to taste the evil  
(consequences)  
Of having hindered (men)  
From the Path of God,  
And a mighty Wrath  
Descend on you.

95\. Nor sell the Covenant of God  
For a miserable price:  
For with God is (a prize)  
Far better for you,  
If ye only knew.

<span id="page_683">p. 683</span>

96\. What is with you must vanish:  
What is with God will endure.  
And We will certainly bestow,  
On those who patiently persevere,  
Their reward according to  
The best of their actions.

97\. Whoever works righteousness,  
Man or woman, and has Faith,  
Verily, to him will We give  
A new Life, a life  
That is good and pure, and We  
Will bestow on such their reward  
According to the best  
Of their actions.

98\. When thou dost read  
The Qur-ān, seek God's protection  
From Satan the Rejected One.

99\. No authority has he over those  
Who believe and put their trust  
In their Lord.

100\. His authority is over those  
Only, who take him as patron  
And who join partners with God.

<span id="page_684">p. 684</span>

##### SECTION 14.

101\. When We substitute one revelation  
For another,—and God knows best  
What He reveals (in stages),—  
They say, "Thou art but a forger":  
But most of them understand not.

102\. Say, the Holy Spirit has brought  
The revelation from thy Lord  
In Truth, in order to strengthen  
Those who believe, and as a Guide  
And Glad Tidings to Muslims.

103\. We know indeed that they  
Say, "It is a man that.  
Teaches him." The tongue  
Of him they wickedly point to  
Is notably foreign, while this  
Is Arabic, pure and clear.

<span id="page_685">p. 685</span>

104\. Those who believe not  
In the Signs of God,—  
God will not guide them,  
And theirs will be  
A grievous Penalty.

105\. It is those who believe not  
In the Signs of God,  
That forge falsehood:  
It is they who lie!

106\. Any one who, after accepting  
Faith in God, utters Unbelief,—  
Except under compulsion,  
His heart remaining firm  
In Faith—but such as  
Open their breast to Unbelief,—  
On them is Wrath from God,  
And theirs will be  
A dreadful Penalty.

107\. This because they love  
The life of this world  
Better than the Hereafter:  
And God will not guide  
Those who reject Faith.

108\. Those are they whose hearts,  
Ears, and eyes God has sealed up  
And they take no heed.

109\. Without doubt, in the Hereafter  
They will perish.

<span id="page_686">p. 686</span>

110\. But verily thy Lord,—  
To those who leave their homes  
After trials and persecutions,—  
And who thereafter strive  
And fight for the Faith  
And patiently persevere,  
Thy Lord, after all this  
Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

##### SECTION 15.

111\. One Day every soul  
Will come up struggling  
For itself, and every soul  
Will be recompensed (fully)  
For all its actions, and none  
Will be unjustly dealt with.

112\. God sets forth a Parable:  
A city enjoying security  
And quiet, abundantly supplied  
With sustenance from every place:  
Yet was it ungrateful  
For the favours of God:  
So God made it taste  
Of hunger and terror (in extremes)  
(Closing in on it) like a garment  
(From every side), because

<span id="page_687">p. 687</span>

Of the (evil) which  
(Its people) wrought.

113\. And there came to them  
An Apostle from among themselves,  
But they falsely rejected him;  
So the Wrath seized them  
Even in the midst  
Of their iniquities.

114\. So eat of the sustenance  
Which God has provided  
For you, lawful and good;  
And be grateful for the favours  
Of God, if it is He  
Whom ye serve.

115\. He has only forbidden you  
Dead meat, and blood,  
And the flesh of swine,  
And any (food) over which  
The name of other than God  
Has been invoked.  
But if one is forced by necessity,  
Without wilful disobedience,  
Nor transgressing due limits,—  
Then God is Oft-Forgiving,  
Most Merciful.

116\. But say not—for any false thing  
That your tongues may put forth,—  
"This is lawful, and this  
Is forbidden," so as to ascribe  
False things to God. For those  
Who ascribe false things  
To God, will never prosper.

<span id="page_688">p. 688</span>

117\. (In such falsehood)  
Is but a paltry profit;  
But they will have  
A most grievous Penalty.

118\. To the Jews We prohibited  
Such things as We have  
Mentioned to thee before:  
We did them no wrong,  
But they were used to  
Doing wrong to themselves.

119\. But verily thy Lord,—  
To those who do wrong  
In ignorance, but who  
Thereafter repent and make amends,—  
Thy Lord, after all this,  
Is Oft-Forgiving, Most  
Merciful.

##### SECTION 16.

120\. Abraham was indeed a model,  
Devoutly obedient to God,  
(And) true in faith, and he  
Joined not gods with God:

121\. He showed his gratitude  
For the favours of God,  
Who chose him, and guided him  
To a Straight Way.

122\. And We gave him Good  
In this world, and he will be,

<span id="page_689">p. 689</span>

In the Hereafter, in the ranks  
Of the Righteous,''

123\. So We have taught thee  
The inspired (message),  
"Follow the ways of Abraham  
The True in Faith, and he  
Joined not gods with God."

124\. The Sabbath was only made  
(Strict) for those who disagreed  
(As to its observance);  
But God will judge between them  
On the Day of Judgment,  
As to their differences,

125\. Invite (all) to the Way  
Of thy Lord with wisdom  
And beautiful preaching;  
And argue with them  
In ways that are best  
And most gracious:  
For thy Lord knoweth best,  
Who have strayed from His Path,

<span id="page_690">p. 690</span>

And who receive guidance.

126\. And if ye do catch them out,  
Catch them out no worse  
Than they catch you out:  
But if ye show patience,  
That is indeed the best (course)  
For those who are patient.

127\. And do thou be patient,  
For thy patience is but  
From God; nor grieve over them:  
And distress not thyself  
Because of their plots.

128\. For God is with those  
Who restrain themselves,  
And those who do good.
