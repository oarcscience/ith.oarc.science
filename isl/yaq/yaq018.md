### Sūra XVIII.

### *Kahf,* or the Cave.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Praise be to God,  
Who hath sent to His Servant  
The Book, and hath allowed  
Therein no Crookedness:

2\. (He hath made it) Straight  
(And Clear) in order that  
He may warn (the godless)  
Of a terrible Punishment  
From Him, and that He  
May give Glad Tidings  
To the Believers who work  
Righteous deeds, that they  
Shall have a goodly Reward,

3\. Wherein they shall  
Remain for ever:

4\. Further; that He may warn  
Those (also) who say,

<span id="page_729">p. 729</span>

"God hath begotten a son"

5\. No knowledge have they  
Of such a thing, nor  
Had their fathers. It is  
A grievous thing that issues  
From their mouths as a saying.  
What they say is nothing  
But falsehood!

6\. Thou wouldst only, perchance,  
Fret thyself to death,  
Following after them, in grief,  
If they believe not  
In this Message.

7\. That which is on earth  
We have made but as  
A glittering show for the earth,  
In order that We may test  
Them—as to which of them  
Are best in conduct.

8\. Verily what is on earth  
We shall make but as

<span id="page_730">p. 730</span>

Dust and dry soil  
(Without growth or herbage).

9\. Or dost thou reflect  
That the Companions of the Cave  
And of the Inscription  
Were wonders among Our Signs?

10\. Behold, the youths betook themselves

<span id="page_731">p. 731</span>

To the Cave: they said,  
"Our Lord! bestow on us  
Mercy from Thyself,  
And dispose of our affair  
For us in the right way!"

11\. Then We draw (a veil)  
Over their ears, for a number  
Of years, in the Cave,  
(So that they heard not):

12\. Then We roused them,  
In order to test which  
Of the two parties was best  
At calculating the term  
Of years they had tarried!

##### SECTION 2.

13\. We relate to thee their story  
In truth: they were youths  
Who believed in their Lord,  
And We advanced them In guidance:

14\. We gave strength to their hearts:

<span id="page_732">p. 732</span>

Behold, they stood up  
And said: "Our Lord is  
The Lord of the heavens  
And of the earth: never  
Shall we call upon any god  
Other than Him: if we  
Did, we should indeed  
Have uttered an enormity!

15\. "These our people have taken  
For worship gods other  
Than Him: why do they  
Not bring forward an authority  
Clear (and convincing)  
For what they do?  
Who doth more wrong  
Than such as invent  
A falsehood against God?

16\. "When ye turn away  
From them and the things  
They worship other than God,  
Betake yourselves to the Cave:  
Your Lord will shower  
His mercies on you  
And dispose of your affair  
Towards comfort and ease."

17\. Thou wouldst have seen  
The sun, when it rose,  
Declining to the right  
From their Cave, and when

<span id="page_733">p. 733</span>

It set, turning away  
From them to the left,  
While they lay in the open  
Space in the midst  
Of the Cave. Such are  
Among the Signs of God:  
He whom God guides  
Is rightly guided; but he  
Whom God leaves to stray,—  
For him wilt thou find  
No protector to lead him  
To the Right Way.

##### SECTION 3.

18\. Thou wouldst have deemed them  
Awake, whilst they were asleep,  
And We turned them  
On their right and on  
Their left sides: their dog  
Stretching forth his two fore-legs  
On the threshold: if thou  
Hadst come up on to them,  
Thou wouldst have certainly  
Turned back from them in flight,  
And wouldst certainly have been  
Filled with terror of them.

19\. Such (being their state),  
We raised them up (from sleep),  
That they might question  
Each other. Said one of them,

<span id="page_734">p. 734</span>

"How long have ye stayed (here)?"  
They said, "We have stayed  
(Perhaps) a day, or part  
Of a day." (At length)  
They (all) said, "God (alone)  
Knows best how long  
Ye have stayed here…  
Now send ye then one of you  
With this money of yours  
To the town: let him  
Find out which is the best  
Food (to be had) and bring some  
To you, that (ye may)  
Satisfy your hunger therewith:  
And let him behave  
With care and courtesy,  
And let him not inform  
Any one about you.

20\. "For if they should  
Come upon you, they would  
Stone you or force you  
To return to their cult,  
And in that case ye would  
Never attain prosperity."

21\. Thus did We make  
Their case known to the people,

<span id="page_735">p. 735</span>

That they might know  
That the promise of God  
Is true, and that there can  
Be no doubt about the Hour  
Of Judgment. Behold,  
They dispute among themselves  
As to their affair. (Some) said,  
"Construct a building over them":  
Their Lord knows best  
About them: those who prevailed  
Over their affair said,  
"Let us surely build a place  
Of worship over them."

22\. (Some) say they were three,  
The dog being the fourth  
Among them; (others) say  
They were five, the dog  
Being the sixth,—doubtfully  
Guessing at the unknown;  
(Yet others) say they were  
Seven, the dog being the eighth.  
Say thou: "My Lord  
Knoweth best their number;  
It is but few that know  
Their (real case)." Enter not,  
Therefore, into controversies  
Concerning them, except  
On a matter that is clear,  
Nor consult any of them  
About (the affair of) the Sleepers.

<span id="page_736">p. 736</span>

##### SECTION 4.

23\. Nor say of anything,  
"I shall be sure to do  
So and so to-morrow"—

24\. Without adding, "So please God!"  
And call thy Lord to mind  
When thou forgettest, and say,  
"I hope that my Lord  
Will guide me ever closer  
(Even) than this  
To the right road."

25\. So they stayed in their Cave  
Three hundred years, and (some)  
Add nine (more)

<span id="page_737">p. 737</span>

26\. Say: "God knows best  
How long they stayed:  
With Him is (the knowledge  
Of) the secrets of the heavens  
And the earth: how clearly  
He sees, how finely He hears  
(Everything)! They have no protector  
Other than Him; nor does  
He share His Command  
With any person whatsoever.

27\. And recite (and teach)  
What has been revealed  
To thee of the Book  
Of thy Lord: none  
Can change His Words,  
And none wilt thou find  
As a refuge other than Him.

28\. And keep thy soul content  
With those who call  
On their Lord morning  
And evening, seeking  
His Face; and let not  
Thine eyes pass beyond them,  
Seeking the pomp and glitter  
Of this Life; nor obey  
Any whose heart We  
Have permitted to neglect  
The remembrance of Us,  
One who follows his own

<span id="page_738">p. 738</span>

Desires, whose case has  
Gone beyond all bounds.

29\. Say, "The Truth is  
From your Lord":  
Let him who will,  
Believe, and let him  
Who will, reject (it):  
For the wrong-doers We  
Have prepared a Fire  
Whose (smoke and flames),  
Like the walls and roof  
Of a tent, will hem  
Them in: if they implore  
Relief they will be granted  
Water like melted brass,  
That will scald their faces.  
How dreadful the drink!  
How uncomfortable a couch  
To recline on!

30\. As to those who believe  
And work righteousness,  
Verily We shall not suffer  
To perish the reward  
Of any who do  
A (single) righteous deed.

31\. For them will be Gardens  
Of Eternity; beneath them  
Rivers will flow: they will  
Be adorned therein  
With bracelets of gold,  
And they will wear

<span id="page_739">p. 739</span>

Green garments of fine silk  
And heavy brocade;  
They will recline therein  
On raised thrones.  
How good the recompense!  
How beautiful a couch  
To recline on!

##### SECTION 5.

32\. Set forth to them  
The parable of two men:  
For one of them We provided  
Two gardens of grape-vines  
And surrounded them  
With date palms;  
In between the two  
We placed corn-fields.

33\. Each of those gardens  
Brought forth its produce,  
And failed not in the least  
Therein: in the midst  
Of them We caused  
A river to flow.

34\. (Abundant) was the produce  
This man had: he said  
To his companion, in the course  
Of a mutual argument:  
"More wealth have I  
Than you, and more honour  
And power in (my following  
Of) men."

<span id="page_740">p. 740</span>

35\. He went into his garden  
In a state (of mind)  
Unjust to his soul:  
He said, "I deem not  
That this will ever perish,

36\. "Nor do I deem  
That the Hour (of Judgment)  
Will (ever) come:  
Even if I am brought back  
To my Lord, I shall  
Surely find (there)  
Something better in exchange."

37\. His companion said to him,  
In the course of the argument  
With him: "Dost thou deny  
Him Who created thee  
Out of dust, then out of  
A sperm-drop, then fashioned  
Thee into a man?

38\. "But (I think) for my part  
That He is God,  
My Lord, and none shall I  
Associate with my Lord.

39\. "Why didst thou not,  
As thou wentest into  
Thy garden, say, "God's Will  
(Be done)! There is no power  
But with God!" If thou

<span id="page_741">p. 741</span>

Dost see me less than  
Thee in wealth and sons,

40\. "It may be that my Lord  
Will give me something  
Better than thy garden,  
And that He will send  
On thy garden thunderbolts  
(By way of reckoning)  
From heaven, making it  
(But) slippery sand!—

41\. "Or the water of the garden  
Will run off underground  
So that thou wilt never  
Be able to find it."

42\. So his fruits (and enjoyment)  
Were encompassed (with ruin),  
And he remained twisting  
And turning his hands  
Over what he had spent  
On his property, which had  
(Now) tumbled to pieces  
To its very foundations,  
And he could only say,  
"Woe is me! Would I had  
Never ascribed partners  
To my Lord and Cherisher!"

43\. Nor had he numbers  
To help him against God,  
Nor was he able  
To deliver himself.

<span id="page_742">p. 742</span>

44\. There, the (only) protection comes  
From God, the True One.  
He is the Best to reward,  
And the Best to give success.

##### SECTION 6.

45\. Set forth to them  
The similitude of the life  
Of this world: it is like  
The rain which We send  
Down from the skies:  
The earth's vegetation absorbs it,  
But soon it becomes  
Dry stubble, which the winds  
Do scatter: it is (only) God  
Who prevails over all things.

46\. Wealth and sons are allurements  
Of the life of this world:  
But the things that endure,  
Good Deeds, are best  
In the sight of thy Lord,  
As rewards, and best  
As (the foundation for) hopes.

<span id="page_743">p. 743</span>

47\. One Day We shall  
Remove the mountains, and thou  
Wilt see the earth  
As a level stretch,  
And We shall gather them,  
All together, nor shall We  
Leave out any one of them.

48\. And they will be marshalled  
Before thy Lord in ranks,  
(With the announcement),  
"Now have ye come to Us  
(Bare) as We created you  
First: aye, ye thought  
We shall not fulfil  
The appointment made to you  
To meet (Us)!":

49\. And the Book (of Deeds)  
Will be placed (before you);  
And thou wilt see  
The sinful in great terror  
Because of what is (recorded)  
Therein; they will say,  
"Ah! woe to us!  
What a book is this!  
It leaves out nothing  
Small or great, but  
Takes account thereof!"  
They will find all that they  
Did, placed before them:  
And not one will thy Lord  
Treat with injustice.

<span id="page_744">p. 744</span>

##### SECTION 7.

50\. Behold! We said  
To the angels, "Bow down  
To Adam": they bowed down  
Except Iblīs. He was  
One of the Jinns, and he  
Broke the Command  
Of his Lord.  
Will ye then take him  
And his progeny as protectors  
Rather than Me? And they  
Are enemies to you!  
Evil would be the exchange  
For the wrong-doers!

51\. I called them not  
To witness the creation  
Of the heavens and the earth,  
Nor (even) their own creation:  
Nor is it for Me  
To take as helpers  
Such as lead (men) astray!

52\. One Day He will say,  
"Call on those whom ye  
Thought to be My partners,"  
And they will call on them,  
But they will not listen  
To them; and We shall  
Make for them a place  
Of common perdition

<span id="page_745">p. 745</span>

53\. And the Sinful shall see  
The Fire and apprehend  
That they have to fall  
Therein no means will they  
Find to turn away therefrom.

##### SECTION 8.

54\. We have explained  
In detail in this Qur-ān,  
For the benefit of mankind,  
Every kind of similitude:  
But man is, in most things,  
Contentious.

55\. And what is there  
To keep back men  
From believing, now that  
Guidance has come to them,  
Nor from praying for forgiveness  
From their Lord, but that  
(They ask that) the ways  
Of the ancients be repeated  
With them, or the Wrath  
Be brought to them  
Face to face?

56\. We only send the apostles  
To give glad tidings  
And to give warnings  
But the Unbelievers dispute  
With vain argument, in order  
Therewith to weaken the truth,  
And they treat My Signs  
As a jest, as also the fact  
That they are warned!

<span id="page_746">p. 746</span>

57\. And who doth more wrong  
Than one who is reminded  
Of the Signs of his Lord,  
But turns away from them,  
Forgetting the (deeds) which his hands  
Have sent forth? Verily We  
Have set veils over their hearts  
Lest they should understand this,  
and over their ears, deafness.  
If thou callest them  
To guidance, even then  
Will they never accept guidance.

58\. But your Lord is most forgiving,  
Full of Mercy. If he were  
To call them (at once) to account  
For what they have earned,  
then surely He would  
Have hastened their Punishment:  
But they have their appointed  
Time, beyond which they  
Will find no refuge.

59\. Such were the populations  
We destroyed when they  
Committed iniquities; but  
We fixed an appointed time  
For their destruction.

<span id="page_747">p. 747</span>

##### Section 9.

60\. Behold, Moses said  
To his attendant, "I will not  
Give up until I reach  
The junction of the two  
Seas or (until) I spend  
Years and years in travel."

61\. But when they reached  
The Junction, they forgot  
(About) their Fish, which took  
Its course through the sea  
(Straight) as in a tunnel.

<span id="page_748">p. 748</span>

62\. When they had passed on  
(Some distance), Moses said  
To his attendant: "Bring us  
Our early meal; truly  
We have suffered much fatigue  
At this (stage of) our journey."

63\. He replied: "Sawest thou  
(What happened) when we  
Betook ourselves to the rock?  
I did indeed forget  
(About) the Fish: none but  
Satan made me forget  
To tell (you) about it:  
It took its course through  
The sea in a marvellous way!"

64\. Moses said: "That was what  
We were seeking after:"  
So they went back  
On their footsteps, following  
(The path they had come).

65\. So they found one  
Of Our servants,

<span id="page_749">p. 749</span>

On whom We had bestowed  
Mercy from Ourselves  
And whom We had taught  
Knowledge from Our own  
Presence.

66\. Moses said to him:  
"May I follow thee,  
On the footing that  
Thou teach me something  
Of the (Higher) Truth  
Which thou hast been taught?"

67\. (The other) said: "Verily  
Thou wilt not be able  
To have patience with me!

68\. "And how canst thou  
Have patience about things  
About which thy understanding  
Is not complete?"

69\. Moses said: "Thou wilt  
Find me, if God so will,  
(Truly) patient: nor shall I  
Disobey thee in aught."

<span id="page_750">p. 750</span>

70\. The other said: "If then  
Thou wouldst follow me,  
Ask me no questions  
About anything until I  
Myself speak to thee  
Concerning it."

##### SECTION 10.

71\. So they both proceeded:  
Until, when they were  
In the boat, he scuttled it.  
Said Moses: "Hast thou  
Scuttled it in order  
To drown those in it?  
Truly a strange thing  
Hast thou done!"

72\. He answered: "Did I not  
Tell thee that thou canst  
Have no patience with me?"

73\. Moses said: "Rebuke me not  
For forgetting, nor grieve me  
By raising difficulties  
In my case."

74\. Then they proceeded:  
Until, when they met  
A young man, he slew him.  
Moses said: "Hast thou  
Slain an innocent person  
Who had slain none?  
Truly a foul (unheard-of) thing  
Hast thou done!"

<span id="page_751">p. 751</span>

75\. He answered, "Did I not  
Tell thee that thou canst  
Have no patience with me?"

76\. (Moses) said: "If ever I  
Ask thee about anything  
After this, keep me not  
In thy company: then wouldst  
Thou have received (full) excuse  
From my side.

77\. Then they proceeded:  
Until, when they came  
To the inhabitants of a town,  
They asked them for food,  
But they refused them  
Hospitality. They found there  
A wall on the point of  
Falling down, but he  
Set it up straight.  
(Moses) said: "If thou  
Hadst wished, surely thou  
Couldst have exacted some  
Recompense for it!"

78\. He answered: "This is  
The parting between me  
And thee: now will I  
Tell thee the interpretation  
Of (those things) over which  
Thou wast unable  
To hold patience.

79\. "As for the boat,  
It belonged to certain  
Men in dire want:  
They plied on the water:

<span id="page_752">p. 752</span>

I but wished to render it  
Unserviceable, for there was  
After them a certain king  
Who seized on every boat  
By force.

80\. "As for the youth,  
His parents were people  
Of Faith, and we feared  
That he would grieve them  
By obstinate rebellion  
And ingratitude (to God and man).

81\. "So we desired that  
Their Lord would give them  
In exchange (a son)  
Better in purity (of conduct)  
And closer in affection.

82\. "As for the wall,  
It belonged to two youths,  
Orphans, in the Town;  
There was, beneath it,  
A buried treasure, to which  
They were entitled; their father

<span id="page_753">p. 753</span>

Had been a righteous man:  
So thy Lord desired that  
They should attain their age  
Of full strength and get out  
Their treasure—a mercy  
(And favour) from thy Lord.  
I did it not of my own  
Accord. Such is the interpretation  
Of (those things) over which  
Thou wast unable  
To hold patience."

##### SECTION 11.

83\. They ask thee concerning  
*Ẓul-qarnain*. Say,

<span id="page_754">p. 754</span>

"I will rehearse to you  
Something of his story."

84\. Verily We established his power  
On earth, and We gave him  
The ways and the means  
To all ends.

85\. One (such) way he followed,

86\. Until, when he reached  
The setting of the sun,  
He found it set  
In a spring of murky water:  
Near it he found a People:  
We said: "O Ẓul-qarnain!  
(Thou hast authority,) either  
To punish them, or  
To treat them with kindness."

87\. He said: "Whoever doth wrong,  
Him shall we punish; then  
Shall he be sent back  
To his Lord; and He will  
Punish him with a punishment  
Unheard-of (before).

88\. "But whoever believes,  
And works righteousness,—

<span id="page_755">p. 755</span>

He shall have a goodly  
Reward, and easy will be  
His task as we order it  
By our command."

89\. Then followed he (another) way,

90\. Until, when he came  
To the rising of the sun,  
He found it rising  
On a people for whom  
We had provided  
No covering protection  
Against the sun.

91\. (He left them) as they were:  
We completely understood  
What was before him.

92\. Then followed he (another) way,

93\. Until, when he reached  
(A tract) between two mountains,  
He found, beneath them, a people  
Who scarcely understood a word.

<span id="page_756">p. 756</span>

94\. They said: "O Ẓul-qarnain!  
The Gog and Magog (people)  
Do great mischief on earth:  
Shall we then render thee  
Tribute in order that  
Thou mightest erect a barrier  
Between us and them?

95\. He said: "(The power) in which  
My Lord has established me  
Is better (than tribute):  
Help me therefore with strength  
(And labour): I will  
Erect a strong barrier  
Between you and them:

96\. "Bring me blocks of iron."  
At length, when he had  
Filled up the space between  
The two steep mountain-sides,  
He said, "Blow (with your bellows)"  
Then, when he had made  
It (red) as fire, he said:  
"Bring me, that I may  
Pour over it, molten lead."

<span id="page_757">p. 757</span>

97\. Thus were they made  
Powerless to scale it  
Or to dig through it.

98\. He said: "This is  
A mercy from my Lord:  
But when the promise  
Of my Lord comes to pass,  
He will make it into dust;  
And the promise of  
My Lord is true."

99\. On that day We shall  
Leave them to surge  
Like waves on one another  
The trumpet will be blown,  
And We shall collect them  
All together.

100\. And We shall present  
Hell that day for Unbelievers  
To see, all spread out,—

101\. (Unbelievers) whose eyes  
Had been under a veil  
From Remembrance of Me,  
And who had been unable  
Even to hear.

<span id="page_758">p. 758</span>

##### SECTION 12.

102\. Do the Unbelievers think  
That they can take  
My servants as protectors  
Besides Me? Verily We  
Have prepared Hell  
For the Unbelievers  
For (their) entertainment.

103\. Say: "Shall we tell you  
Of those who lose most  
In respect of their deeds?—

104\. "Those whose efforts have  
Been wasted in this life,  
While they thought that  
They were acquiring good  
By their works?"

105\. They are those who deny  
The Signs of their Lord  
And the fact of their  
Having to meet Him  
(In the Hereafter): vain  
Will be their works,  
Nor shall We, on the Day  
Of Judgment, give them  
Any weight.

106\. That is their reward,  
Hell; because they rejected  
Faith, and took My Signs  
And My Messengers  
By way of jest.

107\. As to those who believe  
And work righteous deeds,  
They have, for their entertainment,  
The Gardens of Paradise,

108\. Wherein they shall dwell  
(For aye): no change  
Will they wish for from them.

109\. Say: "If the ocean were  
Ink (wherewith to write out)  
The words of my Lord,  
Sooner would the ocean be  
Exhausted than would the words  
Of my Lord, even if we  
Added another ocean  
Like it, for its aid."

110\. Say: "I am but a man  
Like yourselves, (but)  
The inspiration has come  
To me, that your God is  
One God: whoever expects  
To meet his Lord, let him  
Work righteousness, and,  
In the worship of his Lord,  
Admit no one as partner.
