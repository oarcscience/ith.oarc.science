### Sūra LXVI.

### *Taḥrīm,* or Holding (something) to be Forbidden.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. O Prophet! Why  
Holdest thou to be forbidden  
That which God has  
Made lawful to thee?  
Thou seekest to please  
Thy consorts. But God  
Is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

2\. God has already ordained  
For you, (O men),  
The dissolution of your oaths  
(In some cases): and God  
Is your Protector, and He  
Is Full of Knowledge  
And Wisdom.

3\. When the Prophet disclosed  
A matter in confidence

<span id="page_1570">p. 1570</span>

To one of his consorts,  
And she then divulged it  
(To another), and God made it  
Known to him, he confirmed  
Part thereof and repudiated  
A part. Then when he  
Told her thereof, she said,  
"Who told thee this?"  
He said, "He told me  
Who knows and is well-acquainted  
(With all things)"

4\. If ye two turn in repentance  
To Him, your hearts  
Are indeed so inclined;  
But if ye back up  
Each other against him,  
Truly God is his Protector,  
And Gabriel, and (every)  
Righteous one among those  
Who believe,—and furthermore,  
The angels—will back (him) up.

5\. It may be, if he  
Divorced you (all)

<span id="page_1571">p. 1571</span>

That God will give him  
In exchange Consorts  
Better than you,  
Who submit (their wills),  
Who believe, who are devout,  
Who turn to God in repentance,  
Who worship (in humility),  
Who travel (for Faith) and fast,—  
Previously married or virgins.

6\. O ye who believe!  
Save yourselves and your  
Families from a Fire  
Whose fuel is Men  
And Stones, over which  
Are (appointed) angels  
Stern (and) severe,  
Who flinch not (from  
Executing) the Commands  
They receive from God,  
But do (precisely) what  
They are commanded.

7\. (They will say),  
"O ye Unbelievers!  
Make no excuses  
This Day! Ye are being

<span id="page_1572">p. 1572</span>

But requited for  
All that ye did!"

##### SECTION 2.

8\. O ye who believe!  
Turn to God  
With sincere repentance:  
In the hope that  
Your Lord will remove  
From you your ills  
And admit you to Gardens  
Beneath which Rivers flow,—  
The Day that God  
Will not permit  
To be humiliated  
The Prophet and those  
Who believe with him.  
Their Light will run  
Forward before them  
And by their right hands,  
While they say, "Our Lord!  
Perfect our Light for us,  
And grant us Forgiveness:  
For Thou hast power  
Over all things."

9\. O Prophet! Strive hard  
Against the Unbelievers  
And the Hypocrites,  
And be firm against them.

<span id="page_1573">p. 1573</span>

Their abode is Hell,—  
An evil refuge (indeed).

10\. God sets forth,  
For an example  
To the Unbelievers,  
The wife of Noah  
And the wife of Lūṭ:  
They were (respectively)  
Under two of our righteous  
Servants, but they were  
False to their (husbands),  
And they profited nothing  
Before God on their account,  
But were told: "Enter ye  
The Fire along with  
(Others) that enter!"

11\. And God sets forth,  
As an example  
To those who believe,  
The wife of Pharaoh:

<span id="page_1574">p. 1574</span>

Behold she said:  
"O my Lord! build  
For me, in nearness  
To Thee, a mansion  
In the Garden,  
And save me from Pharaoh  
And his doings,  
And save me from  
Those that do wrong";

12\. And Mary the daughter  
Of ‘Imrān, who guarded  
Her chastity; and We  
Breathed into (her body)  
Of Our spirit; and she  
Testified to the truth  
Of the words of her Lord  
And of his Revelations,  
And was one of the  
Devout (servants).
