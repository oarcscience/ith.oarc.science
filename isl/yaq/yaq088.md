### Sūra LXXXVIII.

### *<u>G</u>āshiya,* or The Overwhelming Event.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful.*

1\. Has the story  
Reached thee, of  
The Overwhelming (Event)?

2\. Some faces, that Day,  
Will be humiliated,

3\. Labouring (hard), weary,—

4\. The while they enter  
The Blazing Fire,—

5\. The while they are given,  
To drink, of a bailing hot spring,

6\. No food will there be  
For them but a bitter *<u>Dh</u>arī’*

7\. Which will neither nourish  
Nor satisfy hunger.

8\. (Other) faces that Day  
Will be joyful,

<span id="page_1728">p. 1728</span>

9\. Pleased with their Striving,—

10\. In a Garden on high,

11\. Where they shall hear  
No (word) of vanity:

12\. Therein will be  
A bubbling spring:

13\. Therein will be Thrones  
(Of dignity), raised on high,

14\. Goblets placed (ready),

15\. And Cushions set in rows,

16\. And rich carpets  
(All) spread out.

17\. Do they not look  
At the Camels,  
How they are made?—

<span id="page_1729">p. 1729</span>

18\. And at the Sky,  
How it is raised high?—

19\. And at the Mountains,  
How they are fixed firm?—

20\. And at the Earth,  
How it is spread out?

21\. Wherefore do thou give  
Admonition, for thou art  
One to admonish.

22\. Thou art not one  
To manage (men's) affairs.

23\. But if any turn away  
And reject God,—

24\. God will punish him  
With a mighty Punishment,

25\. For to Us will be  
Their Return;

26\. Then it will be for Us  
To call them to account.
