Follow courses (exactly) computed;

Raised high, and He has set up  
The Balance (of Justice),

For (His) creatures:

Leaves and stalk for fodder,  
And sweet-smelling plants.

Of your Lord will ye deny?

From sounding clay  
Like unto pottery,

From fire free of smoke:

Of the two Easts  
And Lord  
Of the two Wests:

Of your Lord will ye deny?

19\. He has let free  
The two bodies  
Of flowing water,  
Meeting together:

20\. Between them is a Barrier  
Which they do not transgress:

Sailing smoothly through the seas,

Full of Majesty,  
Bounty and Honour.

28\. Then which of the favours

Doth He (shine)!

Of your Lord will ye deny?

31\. Soon shall We  
Settle your affairs,  
O both ye worlds!

The zones of the heavens  
And the earth, pass ye!

Of your Lord will ye deny?

35\. On you will be sent  
(O ye evil ones twain!)  
A flame of fire (to burn)  
And a smoke (to choke):  
No defence will ye have:

Of your Lord will ye deny?

No question will be asked  
Of man or Jinn  
As to his sin,

40\. Then which of the favours

Known by their Marks:  
And they will be seized  
By their forelocks and  
Their feet.

And in the midst  
Of boiling hot water  
Will they wander round!
