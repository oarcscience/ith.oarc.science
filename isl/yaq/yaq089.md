### Sūra LXXXIX.

### *Fajr,* or The Break of Day.

*In the name of God, Most Gracious,  
Most Merciful*

1\. By the Break of Day;

2\. By the Nights twice five;

3\. By the Even  
And Odd (contrasted);

4\. And by the Night  
When it passeth away;—

<span id="page_1732">p. 1732</span>

5\. Is there (not) in these  
An adjuration (or evidence)  
For those who understand?

6\. Seest thou not  
How thy Lord dealt  
With the ‘Ād (people),—

7\. Of the (city of) Iram,  
With lofty pillars,

8\. The like of which  
Were not produced  
In (all) the land?

9\. And with the <u>Th</u>amūd  
(People), who cut out  
(Huge) rocks in the-valley?—

10\. And with Pharaoh,  
Lord of Stakes?

<span id="page_1733">p. 1733</span>

11\. (All) these transgressed  
Beyond bounds in the lands.

12\. And heaped therein  
Mischief (on mischief).

13\. Therefore did thy Lord  
Pour on them a scourge  
Of diverse chastisements:

14\. For thy Lord is  
(As a Guardian)  
On a watch-tower.

15\. Now, as for man,  
When his Lord trieth him,  
Giving him honour and gifts,  
Then saith he, (puffed up),  
"My Lord hath honoured me"

16\. But when he trieth him,  
Restricting his subsistence  
For him, then saith he  
(In despair), "My Lord  
Hath humiliated me I."

17\. Nay, nay! But *ye*  
Honour not the orphans!

<span id="page_1734">p. 1734</span>

18\. Nor do ye encourage  
One another  
To feed the poor!—

19\. And ye devour Inheritance—  
All with greed,

20\. And ye love wealth  
With inordinate love!

21\. Nay! When the earth  
Is pounded to powder,

22\. And thy Lord cometh,  
And His angels,  
Rank upon rank,

23\. And Hell, that Day,  
Is brought (face to face),—  
On that Day will man  
Remember, but how will  
That remembrance profit him?

24\. He will say: "Ah!  
Would that I had  
Sent forth (Good Deeds)  
For (this) my (Future) Life!"

25\. For, that Day,  
His Chastisement will be

<span id="page_1735">p. 1735</span>

Such as none (else)  
Can inflict,

26\. And His bonds  
Will be such as  
None (other) can bind.

27\. (To the righteous soul  
Will be said:)  
"O (thou) soul,  
In (complete) rest  
And satisfaction!

28\. "Come back thou  
To thy Lord,—  
Well pleased (thyself),  
And well-pleasing  
Unto Him!

29\. "Enter thou, then,  
Among my Devotees!

30\. "Yea, enter thou  
My Heaven!
