The Maqámát of Badí‘ al-Zamán al-Hamadhání, tr. W.J. Prendergast
\[1915\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### V. HAMADHANI AND HARIRI COMPARED

WHEN Ḥarírí undertook to compose his Maqámát 'following the method of
Badí‘' a close imitation was inevitable. A comparison of the two works
reveals how closely he followed his model and how largely he drew upon
the original source, not only for ideas but also frequently for themes
and, occasionally, for the language in which to express them.

For example, in maqáma xiii, 147 Ḥarírí, in imitation of Hamadhání, p.
61, introduces the names of colours in an artificial manner. Ḥarírí's
poem, p. 159 closely resembles Hamadhání's verses on p. 90. Ḥarírí v, 49
and Hamadhání v, 20 are identical in title and theme. Ḥarírí xviii, 199
is a very close imitation and, in parts, a literal copy of Hamadhání
xxii, 101.

The themes of Ḥarírí xii and xxxix and Hamadhání xxiii are the same.
Ḥarírí xxx is a variation of Hamadhání xxx. In the

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

former we have the cant of beggars, mountebanks, and the like, and in
the latter an enumeration of the methods pursued by the fraternity of
burglars, cutpurses, thieves, and the like. The themes of Ḥarírí viii
and Hamadhání xxxi are similar. Ḥarírí iii and xlvii have much in common
with Hamadhání xvi and xliii.

In Ḥarírí xlix and Hamadhání xli the improvisors are each made to give
his son advice as to his future career. In the former Abú Zeid advises
his son to follow what he had found to be the freest and most lucrative
of all pursuits, that of mendicancy. In the latter Abú’l-Fatḥ
al-Iskanderí, influenced perhaps by the consideration that he had
derived little personal advantage from the life of the vagabond
scholar, <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) takes a different view
and lays down the rules his son should observe in pursuing a commercial
career. Other points of resemblance will be found mentioned in the
notes.

Allusions to popular sayings and customs, history and legend, theology
and jurisprudence, specimens of eloquence and pulpit oratory, apt
quotations from the Qur’án and the citing of proverbs, the use of the
rare and the recondite, constitute the groundwork common to both books.
The maqámát of Hamadhání are, therefore, an excellent introduction to
the ampler, more elaborate and comprehensive work of his great imitator.

In a comparison of the works of these two masters of the art of maqámát
writing regard should be had to the fact that the maqámát of Hamadhání
are the work of a young man, completed in all probability before he had
attained his thirtieth year, whereas those of Ḥarírí were begun when the
author had reached the mature age of forty-eight, and occupied the last
twenty years of his life. <span id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_113.md)

As regards their relative merits Hamadhání is much more natural than
Ḥarírí. He has more of art and less of artificiality than his imitator.
There is less disposition on his part to indulge in grammatical riddles
and linguistic puzzles, or to ransack the rich resources of the Arabic
language for rare words. The subject is less subordinated to the style,
or the sense to the sound than is the case with Ḥarírí.

And yet the work of Hamadhání, which in his own day made him famous,
from Herat to Northern Africa and earned for him

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

the proud appellation, 'The wonder of the Age ', is little known, while
that of Ḥarírí has been for centuries one of the best-studied books in
Arabic literature and, next to the Qur’án, has engaged the attention of
the largest number of scholarly commentators.

In spite of one's disposition to accord the palm to originality and art
rather than to imitation and artificiality, an author's countrymen are
the best judges of the merits of his literary productions, and therefore
the verdict of posterity in favour of Ḥarírí must be accepted. 'The lame
horse' has indeed 'outrun the sturdy steed'. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md) Ḥarírí, writing nearly a century later,
about A.H. 496, deplores the decadence of learning. 'Whose breeze has
stilled and whose lights have well-nigh gone out.' <span
id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_115.md) Here then is probably the first cause of
the neglect of Hamadhání. As far as we know no carefully collated and
vocalized text of the Maqámát was in circulation before that edited and
annotated by the late Shaikh Muḥammad ‘Abdú <span
id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_116.md) in A.H. 1306, or more than nine hundred
years after the author's death. On the other hand, the work of teaching
and explaining the Maqámát of Ḥarírí was continued by his sons <span
id="fr_117"></span>[4](#fn_117.md) and the first commentary was written
within fifty years of the demise of the author.

Muṭarrízí, the earliest scholiast, was born in A.H. 458, or only
twenty-two years after the death of Ḥarírí, and even then he asserts
that he found it necessary to consult practically the entire range of
Arabic literature, and to refer to the principal Shaikhs of the time
before he commenced his commentary on the Maqámát. <span
id="fr_118"></span>[5](#fn_118.md)

In the case of the Maqámát of Hamadhání there was probably no vocalized
text in circulation, and there certainly was no commentary for more than
nine centuries. Without such aids a literary work of this kind, covering
so wide a field and written in an original and ornate style, would
present considerable difficulty even to the ripe scholar, while to the
struggling student it was doomed to be what it actually became,
virtually a sealed book. These circumstances and facts account, to some
extent at least, for the long neglect of this classic in Arabic
literature.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

If this translation of the text and the efforts to elucidate it but
result in making the author known, as he certainly deserves to be, to a
wider circle of readers, the labours of the translator will not have
been in vain.
