### XLIX. THE MAQAMA OF WINE

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: In my early youth I happened to
have an equable temperament and accurate judgement, and so I held the
balances of my reason even and counterbalanced my seriousness with my
jesting. And I adopted some friends for love and others for pleasure. I
set apart the day for the people and the night for the wine-cup. He
said: 'Now one night there assembled with me some familiar friends,
masters of pleasant ideas, and we ceased not to hand one another the
stars of the drinking-bowls <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1](#fn_1051.md)
until the wine we had was exhausted.'

He said: 'The boon-companions were unanimous in their decision to broach
the wine vats, and we drew forth their contents <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[2](#fn_1052.md) and they remained like the shell
without the pearl, or a country without a free-born man.' He said: 'When
we felt the effect of that our predicament, mischievous inclinations led
us to the inn of the female vintner. The brocade of night was green and
its waves were tumultuous. Now when we had begun to wade along, the
crier of the morning <span id="fr_1053"></span>[3](#fn_1053.md) chanted the
summons to prayer and so the fiend of youthful lust shrank back, <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[4](#fn_1054.md) and we hastened

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

forward to obey the call, and stood behind the Imam with the standing of
the noble pious, with dignity, sedateness, and measured movements. For
every commodity hath its time and every craft its place.

Now our Imam was energetic in his bending and rising, and by his delay
was inviting us to slap him, till he came to his senses and raised his
voice to pronounce the final salutation. Then he sat cross-legged at a
side of the niche, turned his face towards his audience, <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1](#fn_1055.md) looking down for a long time and
snuffed the air continually. Then he said: 'O people, he who has
rendered his conduct unseemly, and is afflicted with his foul behaviour,
should remain at home, <span id="fr_1056"></span>[2](#fn_1056.md) instead
of polluting us with his breath, for verily all this day I have
perceived the fumes <span id="fr_1057"></span>[3](#fn_1057.md) of the
mother of enormities <span id="fr_1058"></span>[4](#fn_1058.md) from some
of the people. Now what is the desert of him who has passed the night
prostrated by the influence of Ṭaghút <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[5](#fn_1059.md) a and then comes betimes to these
houses <span id="fr_1060"></span>[6](#fn_1060.md) which God hath commanded
to be raised, and hath purposed

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

that the last of these should be cut off?' <span
id="fr_1061"></span>[1](#fn_1061.md)--and he pointed to us. Then was the
congregation incited against us, and they fell upon us till our
outer-wrapper garments were torn to tatters, the napes of our necks were
covered with blood, and we vowed to them we would not revert to it. Then
we escaped from among them with difficulty, but, owing to our escaping
safely, <span id="fr_1062"></span>[2](#fn_1062.md) we all forgave such a
calamity. <span id="fr_1063"></span>[3](#fn_1063.md) We enquired of the
children that passed by us concerning the Imám of that village and they
said: 'It is the godly man Abú’l Fatḥ, al-Iskanderí.' So we exclaimed:
'Good gracious, occasionally a blind man receives his sight and a demon
believes! And praise God! he has hastened in turning to Him and may God
not deprive us of repentance like his.' And we passed the remainder of
our day marvelling at his devotion in spite of what we knew of his
immorality. He said: 'Now when the day was, or almost was, in its death
throes, we beheld and lo! there were the banners of the wine-shops <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[4](#fn_1064.md) like stars in a pitch-dark night. At
the sight of them we exchanged gifts of gladness, announced to one
another the glad tidings of a brilliant night, and arrived at the one
with the biggest door and the stoutest dogs. And we made the dinar our
leader and recklessness a thing inseparable from us. We were conducted
to the possessor of a beautiful form, dalliance, and a slender
waist,--when her glances killed, her words made alive again. She
received us well and hastened to kiss our heads and hands while her
aliens <span id="fr_1065"></span>[5](#fn_1065.md) hurried to unsaddle the
camels and the horses.' Then we asked her concerning her wine and she
said:--

'Wine, in sweetness, <span id="fr_1066"></span>[6](#fn_1066.md)
deliciousness and pleasantness, like the dew of my mouth,

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

It leaves the clement one without the smallest quantity of the grace of
his clemency.'

It is as if my grandfather's ancestors had pressed it from my cheek and
coated it with pitch <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1](#fn_1067.md) like unto
my separation and aversion; the trust of the ages, the hidden thing in
the bosom of happiness. The righteous have not ceased to inherit it and
the nights and the days to take away from it, until nought remaineth
save aroma, rays, and a pungent flavour. It is the fragrance of the
soul, the fellow-spouse of the sun, <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[2](#fn_1068.md) the damsel of the lightning, a coaxing
old dame. It is like the heat in the veins and the coolness of the
gentle breeze in the throats, the illumination of thought and the
antidote <span id="fr_1069"></span>[3](#fn_1069.md) to the poison of the
age. With the like of it the dead is strengthened and raised to life
again, and the one born blind is treated so that he sees. So we said:
'By thy father this is the stray! And who is the minstrel at thy court?
Perhaps it is diluted for the drinkers with the sweet dew of thy mouth?'
She said: 'Verily, I have an old man of pleasant disposition and rare
humour. He met me on Sunday at the convent of Mirbad. He spoke to me
confidentially till he pleased me, and so a friendship sprang up and joy
recurred. He told me of his great honour, and of the nobility of his
people in his own country that which directed my love to him, and made
him a favourite, and you will soon make friends with, and have a longing
for him.' He said: 'Then she called her old man, and lo! it was our
Iskanderí, Abú’l-Fatḥ!' So I said: 'O Abú’l-Fatḥ! By heavens, it is as
though he who recited *these lines* had looked upon thee and spoken with
thy tongue:--

'In times gone by, <span id="fr_1070"></span>[4](#fn_1070.md) I had wisdom,
religion and uprightness,  
Then praise God! we sold jurisprudence for the craft of the cupper.  
And, if we live but a little longer, God save us.'

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

He said: 'Then he snorted as snorts the vain, he shouted, he grinned and
laughed immoderately and then he said: "Is it said of the likes of me,
is one like me proverbially spoken of?"'

'Cease from blaming, <span id="fr_1071"></span>[1](#fn_1071.md) but what a
deceiver <span id="fr_1072"></span>[2](#fn_1072.md) thou perceivest me to
be!  
I am he whom every Tahamite and every Yemenite knows,  
I am of every kind of dust, I am of every place.  
At one time I cleave to the niche, at another to the location of the
wine-shop.  
And thus acts whoever is wise in this time.'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'I sought refuge with God from the like of his
condition, and I marvelled at the holding back <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[3](#fn_1073.md) of subsistence from men of his ilk. We
enjoyed that week of ours with him and then we departed from him.'

suggested in Faust by Mephistopheles shrinking at the sight of the cross
or the sound of sacred music.

According to the law of Abú Ḥanífa a man does not render himself liable
to scourging (…) because he smells of wine, unless witnesses give
evidence, or he himself admits, that he has actually drunk wine. The
mere smell, adds the same authority, is not sufficient, for the odour

and al-‘Uzzá, and also the devil and any seducer (Sale's translation of
the Qur’án, p. 28 note). See Qur’án, iv, 54, and liii, 19.

safely:* Another reading … For the sake of the old wine.

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[180:3](mhm57.htm#fr_1063.md) *We forgave such a
calamity:* That is, we were glad to get away at all.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[180:4](mhm57.htm#fr_1064.md) … *The banners of
the wine shots:* Evidently in the time of the author the sale of
intoxicants in Muslim lands was not prohibited and it was permitted to

of the sun:* That is, something calculated to excite jealousy.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[181:3](mhm57.htm#fr_1069.md) … *An antidote;*
Probably arabicized from the Greek θηριακα, φαρμακα, antidotes against
