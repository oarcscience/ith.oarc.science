### XIX. THE MAQAMA OF SASAN

SAID ‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM: One of my journeys set me down at Damascus. Now
one day when I was at the door of my house there suddenly appeared
before me a troop of the sons of Sásán. <span
id="fr_492"></span>[7](#fn_492.md)

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

They had muffled up their faces, and besmeared their clothes with red
ochre while each of them had tucked under his armpit a stone with which
he beat his breast. Among them was their chief, who was reciting, they
alternating with him; he intoning and they answering him. And, when he
saw me, he said:--

'I desire from thee <span id="fr_493"></span>[1](#fn_493.md) a white cake
upon a clean table.  
I desire course salt, I want plucked greens.  
I desire fresh meat, I want some sour vinegar.  
I desire a sucking kid, I want a young ram.  
I desire water with ice, filled in a rare vessel.  
I desire a vat of wine from which I may get up drunk,  
And a cheerful cup-bearer, congenial to the minds.  
I desire from thee a shirt, a coat and a turban. <span
id="fr_494"></span>[2](#fn_494.md)  
I desire thick sandals, with which I may visit the privy.  
I desire a comb and a razor, I want a vessel <span
id="fr_495"></span>[3](#fn_495.md) and a bath glove,  
O what an excellent guest am I! and what a charming host art thou!  
I will be content with this from thee, and I do not wish to impose.'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám, I gave him a dirhem and said to him, 'I announce
to thee the invitation, and we will soon prepare and

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

make ready to receive thee. We will do our best endeavour and thou hast
our promise for the future. And this dirhem will be a reminder for thee,
so take the ready money and expect the promised.' He seized it and went
to another man, and I thought he would address him <span
id="fr_496"></span>[1](#fn_496.md) with the same with which he had
addressed me, but he recited:--

'O excellent one! <span id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_497.md) who hath
appeared,  
As if in stature he were a branch.  
My tooth desires meat,  
Therefore coat it with bread. <span id="fr_498"></span>[3](#fn_498.md)  
And bestow something upon me and give it now down,  
Drop thy hand <span id="fr_499"></span>[4](#fn_499.md) from thy waist and
undo the purse's knot,  
And put both thy hands <span id="fr_500"></span>[5](#fn_500.md) under both
thy arms for me designedly.'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: When this speech of his had penetrated my ear
I <span id="fr_501"></span>[6](#fn_501.md) knew there was excellence behind
it, so I followed him until he reached the mother of his house, and I
stood away from him so that he could not see me, but I could see him.
The princes lowered their veils and behold their chief was Abú’l-Fatḥ,
al-Iskanderí! So I looked at him and said: 'Sirrah, what meaneth this
fraud?' Then he indited, saying,

'This age is ill-starred, <span id="fr_502"></span>[7](#fn_502.md)  
And, as thou seest, oppressive;  
In it stupidity is estimable  
And intelligence a defect and a reproach,  
And wealth is a nocturnal visitant <span id="fr_503"></span>[8](#fn_503.md)
but  
It hovers only over the ignoble.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_492"></span>[81:7](mhm27.htm#fr_492.md) *Sásán:* Sásán
al-Akbar, son of Bahman, son of Isfandiyar, son of Gushtasp a prince of
Western Persia, is the reputed chief and patron of all beggars and
mountebanks. The legend mentioned by Ibn al-Múkaffá is that Báhman being
near his death sent for his daughter Ḥomaya, who was pregnant, and
settled the succession on her and her child, if the child proved a boy,
to the exclusion of his own son Sásán. Sásán indignant at this left the
court and lived the life of a shepherd among the Kurds so that his name
became a proverb for one who leads a vagabond <span id="page_82">p.
82</span> life. Hence 'the people of Sásán, the Kurd', is a phrase
signifying beggars, prestigiators, people that feign blindness, go about
with dogs, monkeys and the like. These people had a cant of their own
which was not thought unworthy of study by the learned.

Sheríshí gives another account of the origin of this term. He says that
after the Persians had been subdued in the time of the Khalífa ‘Umar,
they submitted peaceably to the conquerors adopting their manners and
their religion, and that, being a clever and artful people, they betook
themselves to various ways of making a living, one of which was
mendicancy. Their way of exciting commiseration was to give out that
they belonged to the royal house of Sásán, or, as we call them, the
Sásánians, and to describe the cruel change of fortune and their
deplorable condition. So that at last people came to call a beggar a
Sásání. This may be the true derivation, but it is evident from the
forty-ninth maqáma that Ḥarírí adopted the legend which makes Sásán a
real person. (Chenery, translation of *Ḥarírí*, p. 287-8, and *Ḥarírí*
i. 23.)

<span id="fn_493"></span>[82:1](mhm27.htm#fr_493.md) *I desire from thee:*
Metre, *mujtath*. Cf. De Sacy *Ḥarírí* i. 159.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[82:2](mhm27.htm#fr_494.md) … *A turban:* also a
woman's veil or muffler. syn. … See Aghání ix. 158. Heb. ‏עניף‎ See
lexicon. Isaiah iii. 23 and lxii. 3. Probably from … it became halved,
alluding probably to the length of the veil.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[82:3](mhm27.htm#fr_495.md) … *A vessel:* Probably
situla, a bucket for drawing water, indirectly borrowed from the Latin.
See Dozy *Supplement aux Dictionaires*, i. 653.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[83:1](mhm27.htm#fr_496.md) … *Would address him:*
Literally, meet him.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[83:2](mhm27.htm#fr_497.md) *O excellent one!*
Metre, *mujtath*.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[83:3](mhm27.htm#fr_498.md) *Coat it with bread:*
According to the context this seems to be the meaning rather than the
explanation given by the commentator, viz., that meat was something
forbidden and therefore to desire it was to render him worthy of
stripes.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[83:4](mhm27.htm#fr_499.md) *Drop thy hand:* Lower
it to the pocket to undo the knotted money.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[83:5](mhm27.htm#fr_500.md) *Put both thy hands:*
An allusion to Qur’án xx. 23. He uses both hands here designedly so as
to be sure of getting out some money, not knowing which side ‘Ísá ibn
Hishám carried his cash.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[83:6](mhm27.htm#fr_501.md) *Penetrated my ear:*
Literally, split my ear.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[83:7](mhm27.htm#fr_502.md) This age is
ill-starred: Metre, *mujtath*.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[83:8](mhm27.htm#fr_503.md) … *Nocturnal
visitant:* The Ṭaif al-Khayál or Khayál Ṭaif frequently occurs in Arabic
poetry. It is supposed to be the image of the person beloved which
appears to the lover in his dream. For an excellent account of the Ṭaif
al-Khayál, illustrated by several quotations from the poets, see
*Journal Asiatique*, pp. 376-85, April 1838 (M.G. Slane).
