The Maqámát of Badí‘ al-Zamán al-Hamadhání, tr. W.J. Prendergast

### XLVIII. MAQAMA OF TAMIN

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was appointed to the
governorship of a province in Syria. There arrived there Sa'd ibn
Badr <span id="fr_1043"></span>[5](#fn_1043.md) of the tribe of Fazára, and
he was made wazír. Aḥmad ibn Walíd <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[6](#fn_1044.md) was placed over the postal department,

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Khalaf ibn
Sálim <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1](#fn_1045.md) was posted to the court of
appeal, one of the Banú Thowába <span id="fr_1046"></span>[2](#fn_1046.md)
was appointed to the secretariat, and the assessment office was given to
a Syrian. Therefore the country became the delight of the intellectuals
and their alighting-place. And they ceased not to arrive, one after the
other, until they filled the eyes of the townsfolk and oppressed their
minds. And among those that came, there arrived Abú’l-Nadá, the
Temímite, <span id="fr_1047"></span>[3](#fn_1047.md) but eyes rested not
upon him and hearts were not sincere towards him.

One day he came into my presence, and I appreciated him at his true
worth, I seated him in the chief place of the assembly and I said: 'What
hope has the Master in life and how does he find his affairs?' He looked
right and left and then he said: Between loss and meanness, between
baseness and contempt, and a people like donkey's dung. Prosperity
smells them <span id="fr_1048"></span>[4](#fn_1048.md) but they are
evil-smelling. They are treated with kindness, but show none, By
Heavens! I have come to find them to be a people who resemble human
beings only in head and dress.' And he began to recite:

'O land of Sijistán  <span id="fr_1049"></span>[5](#fn_1049.md) may the
countries be a ransom for thee!  
And for the noble king the people!  
And even if the days will help me,  
And if mount and provisions take me there,  
Still who will compensate me for what has perished of it,  
And for the life which cannot be restored?' <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[6](#fn_1050.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1043"></span>[176:5](mhm56.htm#fr_1043.md) *Sa‘d ibn Badr*.
*The Fazárite;* I have not been able to identify this individual with
any of the important persons of this tribe mentioned in the Ansáb of
al-Sam‘ání, pp. 427-8.

<span id="fn_1044"></span>[176:6](mhm56.htm#fr_1044.md) *Aḥmad ibn
al-Walíd:* I have not been able to identify this person and the name is
probably fictitious.

<span id="fn_1045"></span>[177:1](mhm56.htm#fr_1045.md) *Khalaf ibn Sálim:*
This name is probably fictitious.

<span id="fn_1046"></span>[177:2](mhm56.htm#fr_1046.md) *Banú Thowába:* The
name of a family, originally Christians, not of a tribe as stated by the
commentator, distinguished as official writers or secretaries of state.
The most accomplished member of the family was Abú ‘Abd Alláh ibn Aḥmad
ibn Thowába, secretary to the Khalífa Mu‘taḍid (A.H. 279-89). See
Fehrist, p. 130.

<span id="fn_1047"></span>[177:3](mhm56.htm#fr_1047.md) *Abú’l-Nadá, the
Temímite:* This is probably another fictitious name. There is no trace
of any such person in the Ansab of al-Sam‘ání, p. 109.

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[177:4](mhm56.htm#fr_1048.md) … *It smells them:*
The commentator says it means 'to regard with favour or consideration.'
It seems to signify to test by experiment which, perhaps, by an
extension of meaning, may be said to connote to pay attention to, to
take notice of and the like.

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[177:5](mhm56.htm#fr_1049.md) *O land of
Sijistán:* Metre, *wafir*.

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[177:6](mhm56.htm#fr_1050.md) *Still who will
compensate me for what has perished of it (time), And for the life which
cannot be restored:* That is, what will make up for the time I have
<span id="page_178">p. 178</span> lost, when absent, and for that
portion of my life spent away from Sijistán, which cannot be recalled?
This is a somewhat obscure passage and the commentator has understood it
to refer to the death of the ruler, Khalaf ibn Aḥmad, but this cannot be
as Khalaf died in A.H. 399 the year following the death of al-Hamadhání
398). It is evident this maqáma was composed before A.H. 393, the year
in which Sijistán was wrested from Khalaf by Maḥmúd of Ghazna. See note
on page 148, supra. Cf. the following parallel lines by ‘Ali Ḥusain,
Governor of Ahwaz, brother of Sharaf al-Daula imprisoned and put to
death by his uncle in A.H. 375.

…

Grant that time may conciliate me, and its vicissitudes regard me with
favour,  
That it recompense me with kindness and release (me) from captivity,  
Still, who will compensate me for the days of youth that have gone,  
And who will make up for me for what has been lost of my life in
prison?  
                                                 Ibn al-Athír, ix, 31.
