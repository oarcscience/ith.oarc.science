### XLI. THE MAQAMA OF ADVICE

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí
equipped his son for commerce, he made him sit down to admonish him.
After he had praised God and re-praised Him, and blessed His
Apostle--May God bless and save him!--he said: 'O my dear son, though I
rely upon the soundness of thy wisdom and the purity of thy stock, still
I am solicitous <span id="fr_920"></span>[2](#fn_920.md) and the solicitous
augurs ill. And I am not free from fear for thee on account of desire
and its power, and lust and its demon. Therefore seek aid against them,
in the day by fasting, and in the night by sleeping. Verily it is a garb
whose exterior is hunger and whose interior is sleep, and no lion has
ever put it on whose fierceness has not been softened. Hast thou
understood them both, O son of the vile woman? <span
id="fr_921"></span>[3](#fn_921.md)

And, as I fear the consequences of that on thee, I am not reassured as
to the effect upon thee of two thieves, one of them is generosity, and
the name of the other is greediness. <span
id="fr_922"></span>[4](#fn_922.md)

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

'Beware of these two! Verily generosity is quicker in consuming wealth
than the moth-worm <span id="fr_923"></span>[1](#fn_923.md) is in wool, and
greediness is more unlucky than Basús. <span
id="fr_924"></span>[2](#fn_924.md) Do not quote me their saying, "Verily
God is generous", that is a ruse to wean the child. Yea, verily God is
indeed generous, but God's generosity increases us but does not decrease
Him; it benefits us, but does not injure Him. Now whoever is in this
condition let him be generous. But a generosity that does not increase
thee till it decreases me, that does not feather thee till it plucks
me, <span id="fr_925"></span>[3](#fn_925.md) is an abandonment, I will not
say <span id="fr_926"></span>[4](#fn_926.md) a fiendish one but a fatal
one. Hast thou

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

understood them, O son of the unlucky woman? Verily merchandise brings
water out of the stones. <span id="fr_927"></span>[1](#fn_927.md) And
imagine between one meal and another an ocean gale, except that there is
no danger, and the distance to China, except that there is no travel.
Wilt thou abandon it when it is presented and then seek it where it is
not to be had? Perish thy mother! Hast thou understood them both?

Verily it is wealth--May God bless thee!--therefore be sure not to spend
except from the profits. Thou shouldest eat bread and salt, and thou
hast permission in regard to vinegar and onions, as long as thou feelest
no repugnance towards them and dost not unite them. And flesh is as
valuable as thine own flesh and methinks thou eatest it not. And
sweetmeat is the food of him who cares not on which side he falls. <span
id="fr_928"></span>[2](#fn_928.md) And one meal a day <span
id="fr_929"></span>[3](#fn_929.md) is the fare of the pious. And eating,
when hungry, is a protection against loss, but, when sated, it invites
death. Then be with people like the chess <span
id="fr_930"></span>[4](#fn_930.md) player, take all they have and keep all
thou hast. O my dear son, I have caused thee to hear and delivered the
message, therefore, if thou accept it, God will be sufficient for thee,
but, if thou reject it, God will be thy reckoner. God bless our Lord
Muḥammad, his family and his companions all.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_920"></span>[153:2](mhm49.htm#fr_920.md) … *Still I am
solicitous:* An allusion to the proverbial saying: … 'Verily the very
solicitous, or affectionate, is addicted to evil opinion' (Lane's
Lexicon, p. 1573), i.e. he fears for his friend the accidents of time.

<span id="fn_921"></span>[153:3](mhm49.htm#fr_921.md) … *O son of the vile
woman:* An example of playful abuse.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[153:4](mhm49.htm#fr_922.md) … *Greediness:*
Literally, intense longing for meat.

<span id="fn_923"></span>[154:1](mhm49.htm#fr_923.md) … *Quicker than the
moth-worm:* The proverb is … more voracious than the moth-worm. See
*Arab Proverbs*, i. 133.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[154:2](mhm49.htm#fr_924.md) … *More unlucky than
al-Basús:* (Freytag, *Arab Proverbs*, i, 683). Al-Bases was the daughter
of Munqaḍ the Temímite and aunt of Jessas ibn Múrrah. She had a
neighbour named Sa‘d, and his she-camel named Seráb (See *Arab
Proverbs*, i, 704) having trespassed on the guarded domain of Kulayb
Wail, the powerful chief of the stock Rabiah, Kulayb shot it. Jessas,
incited by al-Bases, who was enraged at this outrage upon her neighbour,
slew Kulayb and the feud began between the tribe of Taghlib, of which
Kulayb's brother Muhalhil was now chief, and the tribe of Bakr. This
war, which lasted forty years, ended in the utter defeat of the tribe of
Taghlib. *Ḥarírí*, i, 307 and *Aghání*, iv, 139-151.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[154:3](mhm49.htm#fr_925.md) *That does not
feather thee till it plucks* (Literally, pares) *me:* Cf. the proverbial
expression … such a one neither profits nor injures.

<span id="fn_926"></span>[154:4](mhm49.htm#fr_926.md) … will not say
'Abqarí but Baqarí': This is one of the several indigestible morsels to
be found in this maqáma. As regards the first word the legend is that …
(Abqar) was a resident of the Jinn. So that whoever does a thing
superlatively well is said to be a sprite of Abqarí. (See De Sacy,
*Ḥarírí*, i, 257), … 'whose sprite is not to be vied with'. Hence it
came to mean some one pre-eminent; e.g. the Prophet related in a dream
mentioning ‘Umar, … 'and I have not seen a chief of a people do his
wonderful deed.' Literally, strike his stroke. It is applied as an
epithet denoting superlativeness of any quality. As used by Zuheir:

…

With horses upon which were demons  
Deserving to get what they sought and to conquer the foe.'

(Shu‘ará Nasrániah, p. 570, edited by Sheikho, Beyrut).

Al-Sam‘ání shows ‘Abkar to have been a real person who was remarkable
for his great strength (*Ansab*, p. 382, line 24). Cf. Herculean. It is,
therefore, clear, when the Arabs wish to exaggerate the description of a
thing, they call it ‘Abqarí.

… or … *Baqari* is applied to those who dwell with a man and <span
id="page_155">p. 155</span> whose maintenance is incumbent upon him,
and, therefore, *dependents*; or … Relating to the ox, ox disease or
bulimy.

If 'I will not say', etc., be taken as qualifying 'abandonment' the
interpretation will be as in the translation, but if regarded as
qualifying 'generosity' the rendering would be: 'I will not call it
(generosity), something superlatively good but a deadly evil.'

<span id="fn_927"></span>[155:1](mhm49.htm#fr_927.md) … *Merchandise brings
water out of the stones:* Apparently a proverbial saying. Cf. maqáma,
xxii.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[155:2](mhm49.htm#fr_928.md) *Who cares not on
which side he falls:* Said of one who deliberately does something which
will ruin him.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[155:3](mhm49.htm#fr_929.md) … *One meal a day:*
From … he ate once a day.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[155:4](mhm49.htm#fr_930.md) … *Chess:* Arabicized
from Old Persian Chatranj, Sanskrit Chaturanga, literally, the four
angles, or members of an army (elephants, horses, chariots,
foot-soldiers). See Letters, p. 393, where there is a composition almost
identical with this maqáma. The conventional concluding lines are
wanting. Cf. *Ḥarírí*, ii, 654.
