### XIV. THE MAQAMA OF AL-FAZARA

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was in one of the regions of
the Fazára <span id="fr_407"></span>[6](#fn_407.md) tribe riding one noble
mount and leading another which in turn coursed along with me. And I was
making for my native land so that the night with its terrors did not
divert me, nor did distance with its deserts turn me from my purpose.

I struck off the leaves of day <span id="fr_408"></span>[7](#fn_408.md)
with the staff of travel, and with the horse's hoofs I penetrated into
the maw of night. Meanwhile, in a night so dark that the Qaṭáṭ would
lose its way, <span id="fr_409"></span>[8](#fn_409.md) and the bat could
not see <span id="fr_410"></span>[9](#fn_410.md) in it, I was going swiftly
and

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

smoothly along, <span id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_411.md) nothing passing
from the right but a lion and nought from the left save a hyena, when
suddenly there appeared to my view a rider fully armed; he was making
for some tamarisk trees and traversing towards me the intervening
stretches of desert. So there seized me because of him what seizes the
unarmed in the presence of one bristling with weapons. But I put on a
bold front and said: 'Perish thy father, stand! Before thou canst attain
thy object thou wilt have to endure wounds of steel, <span
id="fr_412"></span>[2](#fn_412.md) strip the tragacanth <span
id="fr_413"></span>[3](#fn_413.md) of its leaves, and face a stout foeman
with the pride of an Azdite. I am for peace, if thou wilt, or for war,
if thou desirest. Tell me, who art thou?' He replied: 'Peace hast thou
found.' I said: 'Thou hast answered well, but who art thou?' He
answered: 'A counsellor, if thou seekest counsel, an orator if thou
desirest converse, but before my name is a veil which the mentioning of
no proper name can remove.' I then said: 'What is thy trade?' He
replied: 'I roam about the interiors of the countries, in order that I
may light upon the dish of a generous man. I have a mind served by a
tongue, and rhetoric which my own fingers record. My utmost desire is a
generous person who will lower me one of his saddlebags and give me his
wallet, like the free-born youth that met me yesterday as the rising sun
and vanished from my sight with the going down of the same. But although
he has disappeared, the memory of him remaineth, and, though he has
taken leave of me, the marks of his favour accompany me still.' Pointing
to what he had on, he continued: 'None can acquaint you of them <span
id="fr_414"></span>[4](#fn_414.md) better than they themselves.' I
exclaimed to myself, 'by the Lord of the Ka‘ba an importunate, grasping
beggar, experienced in the craft, nay but a past master <span
id="fr_415"></span>[5](#fn_415.md) of the art: Thou wilt have

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

to give him something and pay liberally,' <span
id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_416.md) so I said: 'Young man, thou hast
manifested thy diction; how does thy poetry compare with thy prose?' He
replied: 'There is no comparison between my prose and my verse.' Then he
summoned aid from his natural ability, raised his voice to such a pitch
that it filled the valley, and recited saying:--

'A pure-minded one presented to me by the night, and by the desert,  
And by the five so swift that they barely touched the ground. <span
id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_417.md)  
I applied to his timber <span id="fr_418"></span>[3](#fn_418.md) the test
of the fire of generous deeds.  
And he proved to be, both on the paternal and the maternal sides, of
high degree.  
I sought to cajole him into parting with his property and I succeeded in
cajoling him.  
I endeavoured to facilitate his giving, and it was made easy to him.  
And when we had revealed ourselves to each other, and he found my prose
praiseworthy,  
He tested me in my versification with what he was disposed to test me.  
But, when he shook me, he shook none other than a keen blade,  
And he found me not but the first in the race,  
While I discovered him to be ever bright and beaming, <span
id="fr_419"></span>[4](#fn_419.md)  
And there was beneath him none other than a showy steed, blazed on
forehead and feet.'

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

Then I said to him: 'Gently, O youth, and thou canst command what I have
with me.'

He said: 'The provision bag with its contents.' I replied: 'Aye and its
bearer too.' Then I clasped him with my hands and said: 'By Him who hath
endowed them with the sense of touch, and from one split them into five,
thou shalt not leave me, unless I learn thy state.' Then he lowered his
veil from his face and lo! by heavens! it was our Sheikh, al-Iskanderí!
Without further waiting I said:

'Abú’l-Fatḥ, <span id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_420.md) in pride hast thou
girt on this blade,  
But what doest thou with the sword when thou art no warrior?  
So melt down into an anklet the gold with which thou hast bedecked this
sword of thine.'

will return in the morning bringing water to its chicks, that again in
the early afternoon it will fly to the place once more returning to
bring water a second time without losing its way.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[67:9](mhm22.htm#fr_410.md) *In which the bat

worn. Another reading … most honourable and dignified. Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[70:1](mhm22.htm#fr_420.md) *Abú’l-Fatḥ: in pride
hast thou girt on this blade:* Metre, *hezej*. The MS. in the
Bibliotheque Nationale has the first two lines only. The thought
introduced here is taken from the following lines of another poet (See
footnote on Text, p. 69).

'Thou hast heard what he said but thou carest not for his speech.  
Leave the sword for him who oppresses therewith, the valiant in war.  
And melt down into an anklet the sword with which thou hast bedecked
thyself,  
For what doest thou with a sword when thou art not a fighter?'

Cf. Scott, *Bridal of Triermain*, xxvii.
