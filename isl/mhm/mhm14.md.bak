The Maqámát of Badí‘ al-Zamán al-Hamadhání, tr. W.J. Prendergast
\[1915\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### VI. THE MAQAMA OF THE LION

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: There used to reach me of the
maqámát and sayings of al-Iskanderí <span
id="fr_220"></span>[4](#fn_220.md) such as would arrest the fugitive and
agitate the sparrow. Poems of his have been recited to us whose
refinement pervades the soul in all its parts, and whose subtlety is
hidden from the imaginations of the wizards. <span
id="fr_221"></span>[5](#fn_221.md) And I pray God to spare him so that I
may meet him and marvel at his indifference <span
id="fr_222"></span>[6](#fn_222.md) to his condition in spite of his art

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

and fortune. Fortune had made her benefits <span
id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_223.md) remote by placing barriers between him
and them and continued so to do till I happened to have some business in
Ḥimṣ. <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_224.md) So I sharpened my greediness
of desire to go thither in the company of some individuals, brilliant as
the stars of night, and like saddle-cloths cleaving to the backs of the
horses. We started on the road eliminating its distance <span
id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_225.md) and annihilating its space, and we
continued to traverse the humps of the uplands, mounted upon those noble
steeds, until they became as lean as walking-sticks and were bent like
bows. Now we were fated to pass a valley along the base of a mountain
covered with ala and tamarisk thickets which looked like maidens with
their flowing tresses and suspended locks. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[4](#fn_226.md) The fierce noonday heat turned us
thither to seek a sheltered spot and a midday nap. We had tethered our
horses and had addressed ourselves to sleep with the sleepers, when
suddenly the neighing of the horses startled us. And I looked towards my
steed and behold he had cocked his ears, he was glaring with his eyes,
gnawing the strands of the rope with his lips, and scoring the surface
of the ground with his hoofs. Then the horses stampeded, <span
id="fr_227"></span>[5](#fn_227.md) staled, broke the ropes and made for the
mountains. Every one of us flew to his weapons when lo! there appeared a
lion, in the garb <span id="fr_228"></span>[6](#fn_228.md) of doom,
ascending from his lair, with inflated skin, <span
id="fr_229"></span>[7](#fn_229.md) showing his teeth, with an eye full of
arrogance, a nose distended with pride, and a breast from which
courage <span id="fr_230"></span>[8](#fn_230.md) never departed and wherein
terror never dwelt. We said: 'This is a serious matter and an anxious
business.' There advanced to meet him from among the impetuous of the
party a youth,

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

'Tawny of skin <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_231.md) of the family that
comprises the nobility of the Arabs,  
Who fills his bucket full to the knot of the rope that ties the middle
of the cross-bars,'

with a heart urged on by doom, and an all-effective sword, but the
fierceness of the lion took possession of him and the ground cheated his
feet so that he fell on his hands and face. The lion then crossed over
the place of his falling in the direction of those who were with him.
Then death summoned the fallen one's fellow in the same manner. He
advanced, but terror tied his hands, he fell to the earth and the lion
crouched <span id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_232.md) on his chest. But I threw
my turban at him and diverted his mouth and thus prevented the shedding
of the youth's blood. Then the young man arose and slashed at his
stomach until he collapsed with fright and the lion died of the wounds
in his stomach. We then went after the horses, found such as had halted,
abandoned such as had bolted, and returned to the dead friend to perform
the last rites! 'When we had poured the earth upon our *late*
fellow-traveller we were grieved, aye and what an hour of grief it
was.' <span id="fr_233"></span>[3](#fn_233.md)

Then we turned again towards the desert and entered it. We journeyed on
till the provision bag contracted and supplies were well nigh exhausted.
We could neither advance nor retreat, and we dreaded the two slayers,
thirst and hunger, when a horseman came in sight. We went towards him
and moved

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

in his direction. When we reached him, he alighted from his noble
steed, <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_234.md) kissed the ground <span
id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_235.md) and prostrated himself. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[3](#fn_236.md) He then came towards me, to the
exclusion of the company, kissed my stirrup and sought shelter at my
side. I beheld and lo! a face that shone like the sheen of the
rain-cloud, and a goodly stature,

'When the beholder's eye ascends <span id="fr_237"></span>[4](#fn_237.md)
to, his head and descends to his feet,  
It is unable to take in all his beauties,'

a cheek upon which the down had appeared and a moustache that had just
sprouted; a plump forearm, a supple and slim body. <span
id="fr_238"></span>[5](#fn_238.md) His origin was Turkish <span
id="fr_239"></span>[6](#fn_239.md) and his dress royal. <span
id="fr_240"></span>[7](#fn_240.md) We said: 'Perish thy father!' <span
id="fr_241"></span>[8](#fn_241.md) What has happened to thee?

He replied: 'I am the servant of a king who made a determined attempt to
kill me, and so I ran away, I knew not whither, as you see me now.' Now
his appearance bore witness to the truth of his statement. Then he said:
'To-day I am thy servant and what is mine is thine!' I said, 'Good
tidings for both of us. Thy journey has brought thee to a spacious court
and fresh delight.' The company congratulated me, and

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

he began to look and his glances smote us; he commenced to speak and his
words fascinated us. He said: 'O masters! at the base of this mountain
there is a spring and ye have entered a waterless desert, <span
id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_242.md) so take some water from there.' So we
turned rein in the direction he indicated and we arrived there. The
noonday heat had melted our bodies and the locusts had mounted the
trees. <span id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_243.md) He said: 'Will you not take
the noonday nap beneath this spacious shade, and near this fresh water?'
We said: 'As thou wilt.' He then dismounted from his horse, undid his
belt, removed his tunic <span id="fr_244"></span>[3](#fn_244.md) so that
nothing concealed him from us, except a thin undergarment which did but
reveal his body. We doubted not but that he had quarrelled with the
ministering angels, <span id="fr_245"></span>[4](#fn_245.md) evaded the
heavenly guards, and fled from the guardian of Paradise. He betook
himself to the saddles and removed them, to the horses and fed
them, <span id="fr_246"></span>[5](#fn_246.md) and to the resting-places
and sprinkled them with water. Men's perception was bewildered at him,
and their eyes were fixed upon him. So I said: 'O young man, how
courteous thou art in service and how generally useful! Therefore woe to
him whom thou hast forsaken, and blessed is he with whom thou hast
become friendly! How is it possible to thank God for His favour through
thee?' He said: 'That which you will soon see from me will be even
greater. Do my activity in service and my general comeliness please you?
What if ye were to see me in company, showing some portion of my skill?
It would increase your admiration <span id="fr_247"></span>[6](#fn_247.md)
for me.' We said: 'Go on!' Then he took one of our bows, strung it,
braced the bow-string, put it into the notch, and shot it up towards the
sky and then

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

followed it up with another and split it in the air. Then he said: 'I
will show you another trick.' He then made for my quiver and seized it,
went towards my horse and mounted it, and shot one of our number with an
arrow which he fixed in his chest, and then a second one which he shot
through his back. I cried out 'Sirrah! what art thou doing?' He retorted
'Silence, scoundrel! By heavens, every one of you shall bind his
fellow's hands, or I will make his spittle to choke him.' Nov with our
horses tied up, our saddles off, our arms beyond our reach, he mounted
and we on foot, his bow in his hand ready to shoot us in the back, or to
pierce our abdomens and chests, we were at a loss what to do. But, when
we saw his seriousness, we seized the thong and bound one another. I
alone remained with no one to tie my hands. So he said to me:
'Strip!' <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md) and I stripped. Then he
got down from the horse and began to slap each of us, one after the
other, and to take off his clothes, and finally he came to me. Now I had
on a pair of new boots and so he said to me: 'Perish thy mother! take
them off' I replied: 'I put these boots on when the hide was raw and,
therefore, I cannot remove them.' He said: 'I will take them off.' Then
he drew near to me to remove them, and I stretched my hand to seize a
knife which I had concealed in one boot while he was engaged removing
the other. I plunged the knife into his abdomen with such force, that I
caused it to appear behind his back, and he uttered but one cry <span
id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_249.md) and then bit the dust. <span
id="fr_250"></span>[3](#fn_250.md) Then I arose, went to my companions and
untied their hands. And we then divided the spoils <span
id="fr_251"></span>[4](#fn_251.md) obtained from the two dead men. We found
our friend had given up the ghost and so we buried him. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[5](#fn_252.md) Then we continued our journey and
arrived at Ḥimṣ after five nights' travelling. Now when we reached an
open space in the market, we saw a man with a wallet and a small
walking-stick in his hand, standing in front of his son and little
daughter, and he was saying:--

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

'God bless him who fills my wallet <span id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_253.md)
with his generous gifts,  
God bless him who is moved to pity for Sa’íd and Fatimah,  
Verily he will be your male-servant and she your maid-servant.'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: This man is surely al-Iskanderí of whom I have
heard, and regarding whom I have been asking; and behold it was
he! <span id="fr_254"></span>[2](#fn_254.md) So I gently approached him and
said: 'Command what is thine.' He replied: 'A dirhem.' I said:--

'Thou canst have a dirhem <span id="fr_255"></span>[3](#fn_255.md)
multiplied by its like  
As long as I live.  
So make up thy account and ask  
In order that I may give what is demanded.'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And I said to him:
'A dinar into two, into three, into four, into five, until I reached
twenty.' Then I said: 'How much dost thou make it?' He answered: 'twenty
loaves.' <span id="fr_256"></span>[4](#fn_256.md) So I commanded that
amount to be given him and said: 'Nought avails without God's help <span
id="fr_257"></span>[5](#fn_257.md) and there is no device against
ill-fatedness.'

Literally, thou hast no father. A playful term of imprecation expressive
of surprise or admiration. [Al-Hamadhání](errata.htm#2.md) did not think
this phrase unworthy of elucidation. He explains, 'the Arabs say thou
hast no father concerning anything that is perfect, but it depends upon
who says it.' (Letters, p. 249.) For the explanation of the use of the

fills my wallets, etc*. Metre, *khafif*.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[46:2](mhm14.htm#fr_254.md) … *'And behold it was
he!'* There was a controversy between the schools of Baṣra and Kúfa as
to whether this phrase or … *And behold it was him*--was right. The
Baṣrians held that the former, the one used by al-Hamadhání, was
correct. This phrase would call to mind the dispute originated by
Sibawayh, the greatest of grammarians, in the time of the Khalífa Hárún
al-Rashid (Yaqút, *Dictionary of Learned Men*, vi, 83). Cf. English, It
is me, and the French, *c’est moi*.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[46:3](mhm14.htm#fr_255.md) *Thou canst have a
dirhem*. Metre, *kámil*.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[46:4](mhm14.htm#fr_256.md) *Twenty loaves:* very
defective arithmetic which evokes a well-merited rebuke from 'Ísá ibn
Hishám in the concluding sentences of the Maqáma.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[46:5](mhm14.htm#fr_257.md) … *Without God's
help:* See Qur’án, iii, 154.
