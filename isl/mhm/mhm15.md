------------------------------------------------------------------------

### VII. THE MAQAMA OF GHAILAN <span id="fr_258"></span>[6](#fn_258.md)

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to me and said: 'While we were at Jurján in a
meeting-place of ours discussing, there was with us

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

that chief scholar and narrator of the Arabs, ‘Ismat ibn Badr, the
Fazárite'. <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_259.md) The conversation
finally led us to discuss those who pardon their enemies out of
gentleness and those who forgive them out of contempt, till we mentioned
As-Ṣalatan, al-‘Abdí, <span id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_260.md) and
al-Ba‘ith, <span id="fr_261"></span>[3](#fn_261.md) and the contempt of
Jarír and al-Farazdaq for them.

Said ‘Ismat: 'I will relate to you what mine eyes have seen and not what
I have got from another. When I was journeying in the country of Tamím,
mounted on a noble camel and leading a spare mount, there appeared
before me a rider on a dusky camel, frothing thickly at the mouth. He
continued to advance towards me till our bodies collided, <span
id="fr_262"></span>[4](#fn_262.md) when he shouted: "Peace be unto you!" I
said, "And upon thee peace and the mercy and blessing of God! Who is the
loud-voiced rider who salutes with the salutation of Islám?" He
answered: "I am Ghailan, ibn ‘Uqba." So I said: Welcome to him of fair
renown and famous lineage whose diction is well-known." He replied:
"Broad be thy valley and powerful thy associates! but who art thou? I
answered, "I am ‘Ismat ibn Badr, the Fazárite." He said, "May God
prolong thy life! What an excellent friend, associate and companion!"
Then we travelled together. When we had journeyed on till noon, <span
id="fr_263"></span>[5](#fn_263.md) he said: "Ísmat, shall we not take a
nap, for the sun has melted our brain? I said: "As thou wilt." Se we
moved in the direction of

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

some *āla* trees as though they were maidens <span
id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_264.md) with their hair down, displaying their
charms, and to a collection of tamarisk trees opposite to them. Then we
unsaddled and partook of some food. Now Dhú'l-Rumma was a small eater.
After that we prayed. Then each of us betook himself to the shade of a
tamarisk tree, intending to take the noonday nap. Dhú’l-Rumma lay down
and I desired to do as he did. So I lay on my back, but no sleep took
possession of my eyes. I looked and saw a short distance of a
large-humped camel, jaded by the sun, with her saddle thrown off, and
behold a man like a hireling, or slave was standing guarding her. But I
turned away from them, for what had I to do with enquiring about that
which did not concern me? Dhú’l-Rumma slept for a little <span
id="fr_265"></span>[2](#fn_265.md) while and then awoke. Now this was in
the days of his satirizing the tribe of Murrí, so he raised his
voice, <span id="fr_266"></span>[3](#fn_266.md) and recited saying:--

"Are the traces of Maiya <span id="fr_267"></span>[4](#fn_267.md) to be
found on the obliterated surface of the sand dune  
Which the gale has persistently covered up?  
Nought remains but a battered tent-peg,  
And a fireplace without a fire-taker,  
A cistern with both sides broken,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

And an assembly whose traces have been removed and effaced.  
But I remember it with its inhabitants,  
Maiya and the sociable friend.  
My relations with Maiya were like those of one who scares,  
Gazelles when they appear to him at the dawn; <span
id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_268.md)  
When I would come to her, there turned me away a sulky-faced watcher,
her guardian and keeper.  
There will soon reach Imr al-Qais <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_269.md)
a widely circulated poem  
Which traveller and stay-at-home will sing.  
Dost thou not see that to Imr al-Qais  
Clings his chronic complaint?  
They are a people insensible to satire,  
But can the dry stone feel pain? <span id="fr_270"></span>[3](#fn_270.md)  
In eminence no knight have they, in war no horseman.  
Besmeared and saturated are they in the cisterns of reproach,  
As the hide is saturated by the tanner.  
When men look to them for the performance of generous deeds,  
Downcast and heavy are their eyes.  
The noble abhor marrying their women,  
And therefore all their spinsters <span id="fr_271"></span>[4](#fn_271.md)
"remain old maids."

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

When he got as far as this verse, the sleeper awoke, began to rub his
eyes and to say: "Does little Dhú al-Rumma <span
id="fr_272"></span>[1](#fn_272.md) deprive me of sleep with an
incorrect <span id="fr_273"></span>[2](#fn_273.md) and unpopular poem?" I
said: "O Ghailan, who is this?" He replied: "al-Farazdaq?" Then Dhú
al-Rumma waxed hot and said:--

"As for the base men of Majásh‘a <span id="fr_274"></span>[3](#fn_274.md)  
Never has the thunder-cloud watered their pastures.  
Soon they will be fettered and restrained from noble enterprises,  
And the restrainer shall restrain them!"

Then I said: "Now he will choke and fret and thoroughly lampoon him and
his tribe."

But by Heavens! al-Farazdaq only said: "Fie on thee little Dhú al-Rumma
dost thou oppose one like me with stolen verses?" <span
id="fr_275"></span>[4](#fn_275.md) Then he went to sleep again, as though
he had not heard anything. Dhú al-Rumma went away and I went with him,
and verily I perceived in him humiliation until we parted.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_258"></span>[46:6](mhm15.htm#fr_258.md) Abú’l-Ḥaríth Ghailan
Ibn ‘Uqba Ibn Buhaish, generally known by the surname of Dhú’l-Rumma
(the old-rope man) is regarded as the last of the Bedawín poets. He died
in A.H. 117 (A.D. 735-6) and was therefore a contemporary of Jarír and
Farazdaq, see Ibn Khallikan, ii, 447, and Ibn Qutaiba, *Kitáb al-Sh‘ir
wa’l-Shu‘ará* (De Geoje), p. 333. (The University Press of Cambridge is
publishing for the first time an edition of this poet's work. The editor
is Mr. C. H. H. Macartney of Clare College, Cambridge.)

<span id="fn_259"></span>[47:1](mhm15.htm#fr_259.md) *‘Ismat ibn Badr the
Fazárite:* I think this character may be identified with Abú ‘Abdu’lláh
Marwán ibn Mu‘awiyah ibn Badr al-Fazárí (d. 193 or A.H. 194). Among
those who learned traditions from him was Ibn Ḥanbal (A.H. 164-241)
*Ansab of al-Sam‘áni*, p. 427, Gibb Memorial Series.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[47:2](mhm15.htm#fr_260.md) *As-Ṣalatan, al-‘Abdí*
was a contemporary of al-Farazdaq and Jarír as the following incident
shows: 'When as-Salatan, al-‘Abdí pronounced al-Farazdaq superior to
Jarír in point of lineage, and Jarír superior to al-Farazdaq as poet,
Jarír reported with this proverb:

…

'When was God's wisdom in husbandmen and possessors of palm trees?'
(Freytag, Arab Proverb, ii, 628; Lane, p. 2602 art …) The point of this
lies in the fact that the region of as-Ṣalatan's tribe abounded in palm
trees.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[47:3](mhm15.htm#fr_261.md) *Al-Ba’ith:* a
contemporary of Jarír. He was one of those who had the temerity to
satire the great poet's tribe, the Kulayb. *Aghání*, vii, 41.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[47:4](mhm15.htm#fr_262.md) *Bodies collided:*
Literally, form with form.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[47:5](mhm15.htm#fr_263.md) … *We journeyed on
till morn:* From … noon when the heat is fiercest.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[48:1](mhm15.htm#fr_264.md) *As though they were
maidens:* Cf. Text, p. 26.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[48:2](mhm15.htm#fr_265.md) … *A little:*
Literally, paucity of milk of a camel and then applied to paucity of
sleep in which latter sense it is used by al-Farazdaq, … Their sleep is
little (Lane, p. 2239, art …) Cf. *Arab Proverbs*, i, 613: … His
abundant milk flow preceded his paucity thereof.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[48:3](mhm15.htm#fr_266.md) … *He raised his
voice:* Perhaps originally connected with Heb. ‏קרר‎. For similar
examples of transposition Cf. Arabic … = Heb. ‏רקע‎; Arabic … = Heb.
‏קרע‎.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[48:4](mhm15.htm#fr_267.md) *In the days of his
satirizing the tribe of Murrí:* The occasion of this bitter satire was
the inhospitable treatment of Dhú’l-Rumma by Hishám al-Murr‘í at the
village at Mar’at. See *Aghání*, vii, 57.

*Are the traces of Maiya to be found*. Metre, *mutaqárib*. *Maiya*--The
beloved of Dhú’l-Rumma whose beauty he often extolled in his poems, see
Ibn Qutaibas Sh‘ir wa Shu‘ará, p. 334. Mr. Macartney, the editor of
Dhú’l-Rumma's Diwán, to whose courtesy I am indebted for much useful
information regarding this poet, says, 'although these verses put into
the mouth of Dhú’l-Rumma do not exist in the MSS. of the Diwán, still
they have a genuine ring and the ideas have their correspondences in the
Diwán.'

<span id="fn_268"></span>[49:1](mhm15.htm#fr_268.md) … *dawn:* Literally,
the sneezer; also a gazelle coming before one.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[49:2](mhm15.htm#fr_269.md) *Soon there will reach
Imr al-Qais:* This refers to the tribe of Imr al-Qais, a branch of the
Tamím descended from Imr al-Qais ibn Sa‘ad ibn Manát ibn Tamím, and not
to the poet of the tribe of Kindeh.

This Qaṣída begins with the conventional erotic prologue over the
deserted encampment of the beloved, a prelude which was condemned in the
poet's own day. It is related that, as Dhú al-Rumma was reciting his
verses in the camel market, he said to al-Farazdaq who stopped to hear
him: 'Well, Abú Firás! what dost thou think of that which thou hast
heard?' Al-Farazdaq replied: 'What thou hast uttered is really
admirable.' 'Why then ', said the other, 'is my name not mentioned with
those of the first-rate poets?' 'Thou hast been prevented from attaining
their eminence' answered al-Farazdaq 'by thy lamentations over
dunghills, and thy descriptions of the excrements of cattle and their
pinfolds.' Ibn Khallikan, ii, 447.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[49:3](mhm15.htm#fr_270.md) *Can the dry stone
feel pain:* A rather poor pun on … a stone and … the name of the tribal
ancestor.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[49:4](mhm15.htm#fr_271.md) … *Spinsters:* pl. of
… a spinster or a widow. Another reading … their women.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[50:1](mhm15.htm#fr_272.md) *Little Dhú al-Rumma:*
The diminutive is used to express contempt.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[50:2](mhm15.htm#fr_273.md) … *incorrect:*
Literally crooked, from … lit., a spear straightened or made even.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[50:3](mhm15.htm#fr_274.md) *And the base men of
Majásh'a:* Metre *mutaqárib*; *Majásh’a*: The name of one of
al-Farazdaq's ancestors.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[50:4](mhm15.htm#fr_275.md) *Stolen verses*. This
was no libel: Dhú al-Rumma was notorious for appropriating the verses of
others, See Ibn Qutaiba, Sh‘ir wa’l Shu‘ará, p. 338.

This was not the only rebuke administered to Dhúal-Rumma by al-Farazdaq.
See note on the condemnation of the conventional prelude, [p.
49](#page_49.md), supra.
