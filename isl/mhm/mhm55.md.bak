### XLVII. THE MAQAMA OF SARIAH

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: While we were at Sariah <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[3](#fn_1036.md) with the governor thereof there came
before him a youth with the fragrance of saffron upon him. So the
assembly stood up for him and, out of respect, he was seated in the
chief place; but awe of him hindered me from asking him his name. Then
he began and said to the governor: 'What hast thou done with yesterday's
discussion, perhaps thou hast relegated it to oblivion?' <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[4](#fn_1037.md) He said: 'God forbid! but there has
hindered me from attaining to it a reason which it is impossible to
explain, and one whose wounds <span id="fr_1038"></span>[5](#fn_1038.md)
cannot be healed?' Said the intruder: 'Sirrah, the delay in the
fulfilment of this promise has been long, and I shall not find thy
morrow regarding it other than thy to-day, or

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

thy to-day concerning it other than thy yesterday. In promise breaking,
I can only compare thee to the Salix Aegyptia tree whose blossoms fill
the eye, but there is no fruit there.'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: When he had reached this point, <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[1](#fn_1039.md) I cut him short and said: 'God guard
thee, art thou not al-Iskanderí?' He answered: 'And perpetual may thy
preservation be, how excellent is thy sagacity!' Then I said: 'Welcome
to the commander of speech and to the stray of the generous. <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[2](#fn_1040.md) I have searched for it till I found
it, and sought it till I obtained it.' Then we became mutually friendly
till the highland attracted me and the lowland swallowed him. I ascended
and he descended, and I fared eastwards and he westwards. After his
departure, I said:--

'O would that I knew of a brother <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[3](#fn_1041.md) whose hands were straitened, but whose
fame was extensive:  
Last night he passed with me, but where will he pass this our night?  
May poverty not prosper, <span id="fr_1042"></span>[4](#fn_1042.md) for he
is its exile, and, owing to poverty, I have been deprived of him.  
I will surely place over it, in Khalaf ibn Aḥmad, one who will destroy
it.'
