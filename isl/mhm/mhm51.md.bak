### XLIII. THE MAQAMA OF THE DINAR

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I happened to have made a vow to
give a dinar in charity to the greatest mendicant in Baghdad. I enquired
for him and I was directed to Abú’l Fatḥ al-Iskanderí. So I went to him
to bestow it upon him, and I found him amongst some companions who had
gathered in a circle around him. So I said: 'O sons of Sásán, which of
you knows his stock-in-trade best and is the sharpest in his art so that
I may give him this dinar?' Said al-Iskanderí: 'I am.' Another of the
company said: 'Nay, but I am.' Then they wrangled and disputed till I
said: 'Let each of you revile his fellow, then whoever gains the mastery
carries off the booty, and whoever overcomes takes the spoil.' <span
id="fr_980"></span>[2](#fn_980.md) So al-Iskanderí said: 'O cold of the old
woman! <span id="fr_981"></span>[3](#fn_981.md) O sultriness of
Tammuz! <span id="fr_982"></span>[4](#fn_982.md) O

id="fr_987"></span>[5](#fn_987.md) O refuser to lend the things of the
house! O year of the bubonic plague! O rebellious slave! O damnatory
clause! O oft-repeated speech! O worse than <span id="img_16500"></span>
![](img/16500.jpg) (till) in various constructions! O worm of the privy!
O furred garment in the summer-quarters! O coughing of the host, when
the bread is broken! O belch of the intoxicated! O fetid breath of the
hawks! O peg of the tent! <span id="fr_988"></span>[6](#fn_988.md) O
prop <span id="fr_989"></span>[7](#fn_989.md) of the pot! O non-recurring
Wednesday! <span id="fr_990"></span>[8](#fn_990.md) O avarice of the
vanquished at dice! O grumbling of the tongue! O *lotium spadonis!* O
eating of the blind! O intercession of the naked! <span
id="fr_991"></span>[9](#fn_991.md) O Saturday of the children! <span
id="fr_992"></span>[10](#fn_992.md) O letter of condolence! <span
id="fr_993"></span>[11](#fn_993.md) O pool of impurities! O

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

stinginess of the man of Ahwaz! <span id="fr_994"></span>[1](#fn_994.md) O
garrulousness of the man of Rayy! <span id="fr_995"></span>[2](#fn_995.md)
By Heavens! if thou wert to place one of thy feet on Arwand <span
id="fr_996"></span>[3](#fn_996.md) and the other on Demawand, <span
id="fr_997"></span>[4](#fn_997.md) take in thy hand the rainbow and card
the clouds in the garments of the angels, thou wouldst only be a
wool-carder!'

Then said the other: 'O trainer of monkeys! O felt of the Jews! O fetid
breath of the lions! O non-entity in existence! O dog in strife! O
monkey on the carpet! O pumpkin with pulse! <span
id="fr_998"></span>[5](#fn_998.md) O less than nothing! O fumes of
naphtha! <span id="fr_999"></span>[6](#fn_999.md) O stench of the armpit! O
decline of power! O halo of death! O viler than one to whom clings the
disgrace of divorce and refuses to return the marriage dowry! O mud of
the road! O water taken in the state of fasting! <span

id="fr_1001"></span>[8](#fn_1001.md) O accelerator of digestion! O tartar
of the teeth! O filth of the ears! O tougher than the rope of cocoanut
fibre! O less than a *fals!* <span id="fr_1002"></span>[9](#fn_1002.md) O
more traitorous than a tear! O more rebellious than a needle! O
direction of the boot! O landing-place of the palms! O the word 'would
that'! O leaking of the house! O such and

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

such! <span id="fr_1003"></span>[1](#fn_1003.md) By Heavens! wert thou to
place thy *seant* on the stars and extend thy feet to the limits of the
world, take Sirius as a boot and the Pleiades as a raiment, and wert to
make the sky a loom, weave the air into a coat, make its woof with the
Flying Vulture and weave it with the revolving sphere, thou wouldest be
but a weaver!' <span id="fr_1004"></span>[2](#fn_1004.md)

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'By Heavens! I did not know which of the two I
should prefer, for nought proceeded 'from them save marvellous language,
wonderful aptness, and intense enmity. So I left the dinar before them
undivided and I know not what Time did with them.'
