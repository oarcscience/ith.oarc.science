### XXXIII. THE MAQAMA OF HULWAN

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When I was coming back from the
Pilgrimage with those who were returning, and I alighted at Ḥulwán <span
id="fr_793"></span>[3](#fn_793.md) with those who alighted, I said to my
slave: 'I find my hair is long and my body somewhat dirty, <span
id="fr_794"></span>[4](#fn_794.md) so chose for us a bath that we may enter
it, and a barber whom we may make use of. Let the bath be of spacious
yard, of clean locality, of pure atmosphere and the water of moderate
temperature; and let the barber be deft of hand, with a sharp razor and
clean dress, and little given to gossip.' So he went out for a long
time, <span id="fr_795"></span>[5](#fn_795.md) returned late, and said: 'I
have chosen it as thou described it.' Then we took the direction of the
bath and arrived there, but we did not see the keeper. But I went in,
and there entered in my track a man who betook himself to a lump of
clay, besmeared my forehead with it, and then placed it on my head. Then
he went out, and in came another and he began to rub me with a rubbing
that grazed my bones, to knead

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

me <span id="fr_796"></span>[1](#fn_796.md) with a kneading which crushed
my joints, and to whistle with a whistling that scattered spittle. He
next aimed at my head to wash it, and at the water to pour it. Then
without delay the first entered and greeted the branch of the occipital
artery of the second with a blow of his clenched fist that made his
canine teeth rattle, and he said: 'Wretch! what hast thou to do with
this head when it is mine?' Then the second turned on the first with a
blow of his fist that destroyed his dignity, <span
id="fr_797"></span>[2](#fn_797.md) and he said: 'Nay, but this head is my
right, my property, and is in my hands.' Then they fought each other
with fisticuffs till they were both exhausted, and, then, with what life
was left, they summoned each other to arbitration and came to the keeper
of the bath. And the first said: 'I am the owner of this head for I
besmeared its forehead and placed upon it its clay.' The second
asserted: 'Nay, but I am its owner, for I rubbed its bearer and kneaded
his joints.' Said the keeper of the bath: 'Bring me the possessor of the
head and I will ask him, "Is this thy head or his?"' So they both came
to me and said: 'We want thy evidence, therefore undertake the duty and
impose upon thyself the task.' <span id="fr_798"></span>[3](#fn_798.md) So
I arose and went willy nilly. Said the keeper of the bath: 'Man, speak
nothing but the truth and witness nought but the fact, and tell me to
which of the two belongs this head?' I replied: 'God bless thee! <span
id="fr_799"></span>[4](#fn_799.md) this is my head, it has accompanied me
upon the road, and encompassed the Ancient House <span
id="fr_800"></span>[5](#fn_800.md) with me, and I have never doubted but
that it was mine.' He said: 'Silence! garrulous fellow;' and then turned
to one of the disputants and said: 'Sirrah! how long this contending
with the people for this head? Be satisfied, so valueless is it, let it
go instead to

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

the curse of God and the heat of His hell. Suppose that this head was
not, and that we have never seen this he-goat.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'I
arose from that place mortified, put on my clothes in terror, and
quickly slipped away from the bath. And I reviled the slave with
evil-speaking and contumely and pounded him after the manner of the
pounding of gypsum.' <span id="fr_801"></span>[1](#fn_801.md) Then I said
to another: 'Go and fetch me a barber to remove from me this load; <span
id="fr_802"></span>[2](#fn_802.md) and he brought me a man of delicate
build, agreeable make, like an image,' and I took to him quickly. Then
he came in and said: 'Peace be to thee! From which town art thou?' I
replied: 'Qúm'. <span id="fr_803"></span>[3](#fn_803.md) He said: 'May God
prosper thee! From a land of plenty and comfort, the city of the
Sunnís. <span id="fr_804"></span>[4](#fn_804.md) I was present there in its
cathedral mosque in the month of Ramaḍán when the lamps had been lit and
the *taráwiḥ* <span id="fr_805"></span>[5](#fn_805.md) prayers were
inaugurated, but, before we knew it, the Nile rose and came and
extinguished those lights, but God made me a shoe which I put on when it
was green, but there was no embroidery produced on its sleeve. And the
boy

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

returned to his mother, after I had performed the evening prayer <span
id="fr_806"></span>[1](#fn_806.md) when the shadow is equal. <span
id="fr_807"></span>[2](#fn_807.md) But how was thy pilgrimage? Didst thou
perform all its ceremonies as was incumbent? And they cried out: "A
marvel! a marvel!" So I looked at the beacon, and how light a thing is
war--to the spectators! And I found the *Harísah* <span
id="fr_808"></span>[3](#fn_808.md) in the same state, and I knew that the
matter was decreed and pre-ordained by God. And how long this vexation?
And to-day, and to-morrow, and Saturday and Sunday, but I will not be
tedious, but what is this prating? And I like thee to know that
Mubarrad <span id="fr_809"></span>[4](#fn_809.md) in grammar wields a keen
razor, so do not occupy thyself with the speech of the common people.
Now if ability preceded action, <span id="fr_810"></span>[5](#fn_810.md) I
should have shaved thy head. Dost thou consider it advisable that we
begin?' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'I was bewildered at his fluency with his
malaprop loquacity, and I feared he might prolong his sitting, so I
said: "Till to-morrow, if God will." Then I asked those present
concerning him, and they said: "This is a man from the country of
Alexandria, this climate has disagreed with him and madness has
overtaken him, so that

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

he babbles the whole day, as you observe, but behind him there is much
excellence." I said, "I have heard of him, and his madness grieves me."
Then I recited and said:

"I make a firm promise <span id="fr_811"></span>[1](#fn_811.md) to God in a
binding vow,  
I will not shave my head as long as I live, even though I suffer
inconvenience."'

<span id="fn_801"></span>[133:1](mhm41.htm#fr_801.md) … *Gypsum:* Said to
be arabicized because (ﺝ) and (ﺹ) do not ordinarily occur in an Arabic

<span id="fn_804"></span>[133:4](mhm41.htm#fr_804.md) *The city of the
Sunnís:* Literally, of the practice and the agreement. The point here is
that the people of Qum were exclusively Shí‘ah, there was not a Sunní in
the city. (See Yaqút, iv, 175.) 'And all its inhabitants are Shí‘ah of
the Imámí sect?' … Also de Goeji, *Collection of Arabian Geographers*,
id, 259, line 7 where Ibn Ḥauqal, a contemporary of the author, says:
'Shí’sm prevails at Qum'; also see Letters, p. 423. This is the first of
a number of amazing malapropisms.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[133:5](mhm41.htm#fr_805.md) *Taráwiḥ prayers:* A
form of prayer performed at some period during the night in the month of

because they used to rest between every two pairs of salutations. (Lane,
*Lexicon*, p. 1183; See also Letters, p. 424.)

<span id="fn_806"></span>[134:1](mhm41.htm#fr_806.md) … *The evening

but the calling of that prayer the prayer of the … as the Arabs of the
desert named it, instead of calling it … is forbidden by the Shafa’í
code (*Minhadj at-Ṭalibin*, ii, 61). Hence the malapropism.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[134:2](mhm41.htm#fr_807.md) *When the shadow is
equal:* Another malapropism.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[134:3](mhm41.htm#fr_808.md) *Al-Harísah:* A kind
of thick pottage prepared of cooked bruised wheat, fleshmeat, butter,
almonds, vegetables, etc. (See Mas‘údí, viii, 402-3.) It is said to have
been invented by the Sásánians and to have been the favourite dish of
Anushirwán.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[134:4](mhm41.htm#fr_809.md) *Al-Mubarrad* (A.H.
210-286): The well-known eminent philologer and grammarian, author of
the *Kámil* (edited by Wright). Ibn Khallikan, iii, 31.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[134:5](mhm41.htm#fr_810.md) … *Now if ability
preceded action:* A reference to the technical language of the Ash’arite
school representing the orthodox opinion that 'the ability (*istitá’a*)
to do the action goes along with the action and is the essence of the
power (*Qudra*) by which the action takes places'. (Macdonald, *Muslim
Theology*, p. 310.) This was how the orthodox disposed of the doctrine
of free will. On the other hand, the partisans of the Freedom of the
Will maintained that the ability to do is always present. It is possible
that Hamadhání may have been aware of the Aristotelian treatment of the
question of ἐνεργεια and δυναμις. Translations of Aristotle's works were
to be found in the library of the Ṣáḥib to which the author probably had
free access during his stay at the Wazír's court from A.H. 380.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[135:1](mhm41.htm#fr_811.md) *I make a firm
promise:* Metre, *ramal*.
