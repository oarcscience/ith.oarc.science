<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: I was in Ba&#7779;ra and with me was Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717; al-Iskander&iacute;, the man of eloquence who summons it and it responds to him, the man of rhetoric who commands it and it obeys him.

We thought he was joking, but behold! the reverse was the fact, and jest was the essence of earnestness. He withdrew from the table and abandoned co-operation with his brethren. So we ordered it to be removed and it was taken away, and with it the hearts; eyes travelled behind it, mouths watered for it, lips were licked for it, livers were inflamed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_536"></A><A HREF="#fn_536"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> after it and hearts followed in its trail. But we associated ourselves with him in separation from it and we enquired of him the fact concerning it. He answered: 'My story regarding it is more extensive than my misfortune in it and, if I were to relate it to you, I should not be secure from hate and from wasting time.' We said: 'Produce it.' He said: 'While I was in Baghdad a merchant invited me to partake of ma&#7693;irah and he clung to me with the clinging of a pressing creditor, and of the dog to the companions of al-Raq&iacute;m,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="#fn_537"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> till I accepted his invitation to it, so we started.

I love her because she loves me, and it is a mark of a man's good fortune that he should be given a lawful helpmeet and that he should be aided by his spouse, and especially when she is of his own clay. In near relationship she is my paternal uncle's daughter, her clay is my clay, her town is my town, her paternal uncles are my paternal uncles and her origin is my origin. But in disposition she is more generous than I am, and in form more beautiful. He bored&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_541"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> me with his wife's virtues till we reached his quarter, whereupon he said: 'Sir, seest thou this quarter? It is the best quarter in Baghdad. Worthy men vie with one another for settling in it, and the great ones jealously compete with one another for finding quarters in it; but none but merchants live in it. Verily a man is known by his neighbour.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> My house is in the middle of its belt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_543"></A><A HREF="#fn_543"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> of buildings and is the point in the centre of its circle. How much dost thou think, Sir, was spent upon each house in it? Say approximately, if thou dost not know for certain.' I replied: 'Much.' Said he: 'Good gracious, what a terrible mistake!' thou sayest 'much' only! and he heaved a deep sigh and ejaculated: 'Praise Him who knoweth all things!' And we reached the door of his house and he said: 'This is my house, how much dost thou reckon I spent on this window? By heavens! I spent upon it beyond my means</p>

<p>and what exceeded the limits of poverty. How dost thou find its workmanship and shape? I adjure thee by God, hast thou ever seen its like? Observe the fine finish of it. Ponder its curves which seem to have been drawn with a compass.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_544"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Regard the skill of the carpenter in the make of this door. Of how many planks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_545"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> did he make it? Say, How do I know? It is made of teakwood:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_546"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from one piece which was neither worm-eaten nor rotten. When it is moved it creaks, and, when it is struck with the finger, it rings. Who made it, Sir? Abi Is&#7717;&aacute;q ibn Mu&#7717;ammad the Ba&#7779;ar&iacute;an made it, and he is, by Heavens! a man of clean reputation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_547"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> well acquainted with the art of making doors, deft of hand in the work. What a splendid man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_548"></A><A HREF="#fn_548"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> that is! By my life I shall employ none but him for such work as this. Now this knocker; dost thou observe it? I bought it in the fancy bazaar from &#8216;Imr&aacute;n, the curiosity dealer, for three Mu&#8217;izz&iacute; dinars.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_549"></A><A HREF="#fn_549"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> How much brass&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> does it contain, Sir?

By the preciousness of my life to thee, do not buy knockers except from him, for he sells only the best.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> Then he knocked at the door, we entered the vestibule&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> and he said: 'May God prosper thee, O house! and not destroy thee, O wall!

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> How many devices didst devise before thou didst appropriate it?' I had a neighbour surnamed Ab&uacute; Suleyman, who lived in this quarter. He had of live stock&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> more than enclosure could contain, and of dead stock more than could be weighed. He died--may God have mercy upon him!--and left a son who squandered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> it on wine and music&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and scattered it between backgammon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and dice. I was afraid lest excessive need should compel him to dispose of the house and he should sell it while in a state of vexation, or expose it to ruin, in which case I should see the chance of buying it lost, and wear myself out with vain regrets to my dying day. So I took some stuff not in demand, carried it to him and offered it to him, and I bargained with him to buy it on credit; and the unfortunate one counts credit a gift, and the promise breaker considers it a present. And I asked him for a bond for the goods, so he granted it, and signed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_557"></A><A HREF="#fn_557"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> it in my favour. Then I pretended to be indifferent in demanding payment till the extremities of the garment of his state became frayed, and then I came to him and asked him to pay the debt. He begged for time and I respited him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_558"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> He next asked for some stuff besides that; so I brought it and asked him to mortgage his house to me as a security in my hands, and he did so. Then I gradually involved him in bargains till it came to selling the house and it was acquired by me through rising fortune, and helping fate, and the strength of my arm. '<i>There is many a toiler for an idle sitter</i>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_559"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> And, praise God, I am exceedingly lucky, and in such matters worthy of commendation,</p>

<p>and this will suffice thee, Sir. For many nights I had been sleeping in my house with those therein when lo! there was a knock at the door, I said, 'who is the wandering nocturnal visitor?' And behold it was a woman with a pearl necklace with a surface as clear as water, and in fineness like unto the mirage, which she offered for sale! So I snatched it from her with a plundering snatch and bought it for a low, price and soon there will be derived from it a manifest gain and plentiful profit, by the help of God, the most High, and thy good fortune. I have only related this story to thee that thou mightest know the propitiousness of my fortune in commerce. 'Luck brings forth water from stones.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_560"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Great God! None can inform thee more truly than thyself and naught is nearer to thee than thy yesterday. I bought this mat in an auction. It was taken from the house of the Fur&aacute;t family&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_561"></A><A HREF="#fn_561"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> at the time of sequestration and plundering. For a long time I had been seeking one like it, but had found none. But time is pregnant and it is not known what it will bring forth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_562"></A><A HREF="#fn_562"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Then it so happened I was at the T&aacute;q gate and</p>

<p>this was being offered for sale in the streets. So I weighed out for it such and such a sum of dinars I adjure thee by God observe its fineness, softness, workmanship, and colour, for it is of great worth. Its like is found but rarely. If thou hast heard of Ab&uacute; &#8216;Imr&aacute;n, the mat-weaver, it is his handiwork. And he has a son who will succeed him and who is now in his shop. Fine mats can only be had of him. By my life! do not buy mats except at his shop. Now the righteous man is his brethren's counsellor, especially of him whose person is rendered inviolable by eating at his table. Let us return to the story of the Ma&#7693;irah for noontide has approached. 'Boy! the basin and the water!' I said 'Great God! perhaps deliverance is nigh, and escape has become easy.' The slave came forward. He asked: 'Dost thou see this slave, he is of Greek origin, brought up in &#8216;Ir&aacute;q. Step forward boy, uncover thy head, bare thy calf, tuck up thy sleeves, expose thy teeth, advance, retire!' The slave did so. Said the merchant: who bought him? 'By Heavens! Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s bought him from the slave dealer. Put down the basin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_563"></A><A HREF="#fn_563"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and bring the ewer.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_564"></A><A HREF="#fn_564"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> The slave put it down and the merchant picked it up, turned it round, looked it over, sounded it and said: 'Look at this brass,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_565"></A><A HREF="#fn_565"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> it seems like a burning brand, or a piece of gold. Its brass is Syrian and it is of &#8216;Ir&aacute;q workmanship. It is not a worn-out curio. It has known and made the round of the palaces of kings; consider its beauty and ask me 'When didst thou buy it?' 'I bought it, by Heavens! in the famine year and I have preserved it for this hour. Boy, the ewer!' And he brought it. And the merchant took it up, turned it over and said: 'The spout is of one piece with it. This ewer is fit only for this basin, and this basin is only suitable for this company&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_566"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and this company suits only this house and this house is not adorned except by this guest.

<p>nigh. I adjure thee by God, dost thou see this water? How pure it is! Blue as the eye of the cat, clear as a crystal wand, drawn from the Euphrates, and it is used after standing for the night when it has become like the flame of a torch and translucent as a tear. And the importance is not in the water carrier, but in the vessel. Nothing proves to thee the purity of the vessel more correctly than the purity of the liquid. Now this napkin, ask of me its story. It is a fabric of Jurj&aacute;n and a production of Arraj&aacute;n. It fell to my lot and I bought it. My wife took a portion of it for drawers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_567"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and I made some of it into a napkin.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Her drawers took twenty cubits&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and I forcibly wrested this much from her hand, gave it to the embroiderer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_570"></A><A HREF="#fn_570"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to make and embroider it as thou seest it. Then I brought it back from the market and stored it away in a box and preserved it for refined guests. The common Arabs have not defiled it with their hands, nor women with the corners of their eyes, for every precious thing has its day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_571"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and every instrument its people. Boy! the table! for the delay is great, and the bowls! for the discussion has been long, and the food! for words have been multiplied.' The slave brought the table. The merchant then turned it over</p>

<p>sounded it with his fingers, and bit it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_572"></A><A HREF="#fn_572"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with his teeth and said: 'May God prosper Baghdad, how excellent are her goods and skilful her artisans! By Heavens! observe this table, look at the breadth of its surface, the lightness of its weight, the soundness of its timber and the beauty of its make.' Said I: 'This is the make but when is the meal?' He answered: 'Immediately. Boy! quick, the food! But the table, its legs are a part of it.' Said Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717;, 'My spirit boiled,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_573"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and I said: 'There remaineth the baking and its implements, the bread and its properties, the wheat and whence the grain was first bought, and how the transport was hired for it, in which mill it was ground and the vessel in which it was kneaded, which oven was heated and which baker was hired; and there remaineth the wood, whence it was gathered, when it was brought in, how it was stacked till it was seasoned and how it was stored until it dried. Then there are left the baker and his description, the apprentice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and his qualification, the flour and its praise, the leaven and its tale, the salt and its savour; and then there remain, the dishes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and who had them, how he procured them, who used them and who made them. Then the vinegar, how its grapes were picked, or how its ripe dates were bought, how its press was plastered, how the essence was extracted, how its jar was besmeared with pitch and how much its vat is worth. Then there remain the vegetables and the devices whereby they were picked, in which vegetable garden they were arranged, and the skill displayed to produce them free from impurities. Then there remaineth the Ma&#7693;irah&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and how its meat was bought and its extra fat was got, how its cooking pot was set up, how its fire</p>

<p>was kindled, how its spices were pounded, till, finally, it was well-cooked and its gravy became consistent. But this is a mighty matter and a never-ending affair?' So I arose. He asked: 'Whither dost thou intend to go?' I replied, 'I intend to go to discharge a need.' He enquired: 'Sir, dost thou want a privy that makes the spring quarters of the prince, and the autumn residence of the waz&iacute;r appear contemptible? Its top has been plastered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with gypsum and its bottom with mortar, its roof has been made flat and its floor paved with marble. The ant slips down from its wall and cannot cling, and the fly tries to walk upon its floor but slides. It has a door whose venetians are made alternately of teak and ivory and joined together with an excellent joining so that the guest desires to eat in it.' Said I: 'Eat thou from this bag, the privy was not in the reckoning.' And I went out towards the door, quickened my pace and began to run, while he was following me and shouting: 'Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717;! the Ma&#7693;irah! 'And the boys thought Ma&#7693;irah was a title of mine, and took up his cry. So out of excessive vexation I threw a stone at one of them, but a man received it on his turban and it sank into his skull. Therefore I was attacked with sandals,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> old and new, and with cuffs good and bad; and then I was placed in prison and remained in that unfortunate plight for two years. So I vowed not to eat Ma&#7693;irah as long as I lived. Now ye men of Hamadh&aacute;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> am I unjust in this?' Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m 'So we accepted his excuse, we vowed the same vow and said: "Long since did Ma&#7693;irah sin against the noble and prefer the base&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_580"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to the good."'</p>

Some will have it to be the name of the mountain, or the valley, wherein the cave was; some say it was the name of their dog and others, who seem to come nearest the true signification, that it was a brass plate, or stone tablet placed near the mouth of the cave in which the young men, the companions of the cave, were.

There were four brothers who rose to eminence during the reign of Muqtadir b&#8217;ill&aacute;h (A.H. 295-320) namely, A&#7717;mad Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s, &#8216;Abdull&aacute;h Ja&#8216;far, Ab&uacute; &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; Ibr&aacute;h&iacute;m, Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-&#7716;asan &#8216;Al&iacute;. Their father was Mu&#7717;ammad Ibn M&uacute;s&aacute;, an agent to the Khal&iacute;fa Munta&#7779;ir (A.H. 247).</p>  
<p>Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-&#7716;asan &#8216;Al&iacute;, the most celebrated of the four, was three times waz&iacute;r to al-Muqtadir. He was a man of great natural gifts, an excellent administrator, and liberal to extravagance. In A.H. 299 the Khal&iacute;fa dismissed him and seized all his vast wealth. This is the incident Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute; refers to. From the time of his dismissal to his reinstatement in 304 the income from his estates to the public treasury amounted to no less than seven million dinars. On his reappointment in 304 the Khal&iacute;fa showed him the highest favours, sending him seven cloaks of honour and 300,000 dirhems. Two years later he was again arrested and thrown into prison. In 311 he was restored to his post for the third time and marked his resumption of office by acts which have left a stain on his memory. He exacted large sums from many people and allowed his son, Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Mu&#7717;&aacute;ssin, to put to death &#7716;amid ibn al-&#8216;Abb&aacute;s, the late waz&iacute;r. The following year he fell for the third time, when it was found that he possessed upwards of a million dinars, and that his landed property produced an annual income of a million dinars. A few days later he and his son Mu&#7717;&aacute;ssin were put to death by Nazuk the chief of the police. (See Ahmedroz, <i>Waz&iacute;rs of Hil&aacute;l</i>.
