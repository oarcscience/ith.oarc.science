### XXIII. THE MAQAMA OF THE AMULET

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When exile had taken me as far
as Báb al-Abwáb <span id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_581.md) I was content with
return as a booty, <span id="fr_582"></span>[2](#fn_582.md) but there
intervened between it the bounding main <span
id="fr_583"></span>[3](#fn_583.md) with its lofty waves, and the ships
going out of their courses with their passengers. But I sought a good
omen from God concerning returning, and I sat in a most dangerous place
in the ship. Now when the sea had got the ascendency over us, and the
night enveloped us, there overwhelmed us a cloud raining in
torrents <span id="fr_584"></span>[4](#fn_584.md) and marshalling mountains
of mist with a wind which sent the waves along in pairs and the rain in
hosts. <span id="fr_585"></span>[5](#fn_585.md) Thus we were left in the
hand of death between two seas, <span id="fr_586"></span>[6](#fn_586.md)
while we possessed no equipment but prayer, no device except weeping,
and no protection save hope, and we spent a night of Nabigah! <span
id="fr_587"></span>[7](#fn_587.md) and in the morning we cried and
complained to one another. Now there was among us a man whose eyelid was
not wetted

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

and whose eye was not moistened; he was expanded and dilated of
bosom, <span id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_588.md) light-hearted and glad. Now
by Heavens! we were perfectly astonished, and so we said to him! 'What
hath given thee security from destruction?' And he said: 'An amulet
whose possessor will not drown, and, if I wished to give each of you a
charm, <span id="fr_589"></span>[2](#fn_589.md) I could do so.' So all
inclined towards him and were persistent in demanding from him. But he
said: 'I will not do so till every one of you gives me a dinar now, and
promises me another when he is saved.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'We paid
him down what he demanded and promised him what he stipulated. Then his
hand returned to his pocket and he drew forth a piece of silk in which
there was an ivory box whose interior <span
id="fr_590"></span>[3](#fn_590.md) enclosed some billets, and he threw each
of us one of them.

When the ship got safe to shore and we landed in the city, <span
id="fr_591"></span>[4](#fn_591.md) he demanded of the people what they had
promised him, so they paid him. It finally came to my turn, but he said:
'Leave him.' Then I said to him, 'That is thine after thou acquaintest
me with the secret of thy condition.' He said, 'I am from the city of
Alexandria.' I asked, 'How was it that patience helped thee but forsook
us?' He said:--

'Woe, to thee! <span id="fr_592"></span>[5](#fn_592.md) were it not for
patience I had not  
Filled my purse with gold.  
He will not obtain glory who is impatient  
At what befalls him.  
Again, what was given me has not now resulted in harm to me.  
Rather with it do I strengthen my loins  
And bind up the broken.  
And if I were to-day among the drowned,  
I should not have been troubled for an explanation.' <span
id="fr_593"></span>[6](#fn_593.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_581"></span>[98:1](mhm31.htm#fr_581.md) *The Gate of Gates:*
or Darband, a town in the province of Daghistán on the western shore of
the Caspian Sea. To the south lies the seaward extremity of the
Caucasian wall (fifty miles long) otherwise known as Alexander's wall,
blocking the narrow pass of the Iron Gate, or Caspian Gates. This, when
entire, had a height of twenty-nine feet and a thickness of about ten
feet and with its iron gates and numerous watch towers formed a valuable
defence of the Persian frontier. The walls and the citadel are believed
to belong to the time of Anushirwán (A.D. 531-579). Yaqút says the
breadth of the wall was 300 cubits or about 150 yards. It was captured
in A.H. 19 by the Arabs under Suraqa ibn ‘Amr, also called Dhú’l-Nún. In
A.D. 728 the Arabs entered into possession and established a
principality in the city which they called Bab al-Abwáb, or the Chief
Gate. Harlan al-Rashid lived here at different times and made it famous
as a seat of arts and commerce. It was noted for its linen manufacture.
(Yaqút, i, 437. *Encyclopaedia Britannica*, viii, 64.)

<span id="fn_582"></span>[98:2](mhm31.htm#fr_582.md) *I was content with
return as a booty:* That is, I was content with return as my only
return. *Arab Proverbs*, i, 537.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[98:3](mhm31.htm#fr_583.md) *The bounding main:*
The sea referred to was the Caspian and this is no exaggerated
description of its stormy character. The winds from the north and the
north-west sometimes blow for days together with great violence,
rendering navigation extremely dangerous.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[98:4](mhm31.htm#fr_584.md) *Raining in torrents:*
Literally extending ropes of rain.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[98:5](mhm31.htm#fr_585.md) *In hosts, or troops:*
An allusion to Qur’án, cx, 2.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[98:6](mhm31.htm#fr_586.md) *Between two seas:*
i.e., the torrents above and the sea beneath.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[98:7](mhm31.htm#fr_587.md) *A night of Nabigah:*
An allusion to the oft-quoted lines of Nabigah.

…

And I passed a night as I should have passed had one of the spotted
snakes attacked me, the poison of whose fangs is deadly.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[99:1](mhm31.htm#fr_588.md) … *Expanded of bosom:*
That is, easy in mind.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[99:2](mhm31.htm#fr_589.md) *A charm:* The
commentator says (Text, p. 117) that Islám forbids the use of charms,
but the statement is unsupported by authority.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[99:3](mhm31.htm#fr_590.md) … *Whose interior:*
Literally, whose breast.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[99:4](mhm31.htm#fr_591.md) *We landed in the
city:* Literally, the city caused us to alight. A very common
construction where the adverb is made the subject of the sentence.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[99:5](mhm31.htm#fr_592.md) *Woe to thee!:* Metre,
*ramal*.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[99:6](mhm31.htm#fr_593.md) Compare this maqáma
with *Ḥarírí*, pp. 130 and 494.
