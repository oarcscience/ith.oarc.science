------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XXVI. THE MAQAMA OF THE EXHORTATION

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: when I was in Baṣra I was going
proudly along until my walk led me to an open space in which many people
were assembled before a man who was standing, admonishing them and
saying: 'O people, ye have not been left without control.' <span
id="fr_627"></span>[6](#fn_627) Verily joined to to-day is
to-morrow. <span id="fr_628"></span>[7](#fn_628) Ye are descending into
a deep place, therefore prepare against it what force ye are able. And
verily after this life is the judgement, <span
id="fr_629"></span>[8](#fn_629) therefore get provisions ready for it.
Behold there is no excuse, for the highway has been made clear unto you.
God's case against you is clear, <span id="fr_630"></span>[9](#fn_630)
by revelation from Heaven and by examples on earth. Lo! Verily He, who
with knowledge created the race, maketh the dry bones live.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Is not the world
indeed a house of probation and a bridge to cross? He who traverses it
is saved, but he who hoards up the world repenteth. Behold it has laid
the snare and spread the grain for you. Therefore whoever pastures there
will be entrapped, and whoever picks up the grain will be ensnared. Lo!
poverty was the garb of your Prophet, <span
id="fr_631"></span>[1](#fn_631) therefore wear it; but wealth is the
robe of rebellion against God, therefore put it not on. False are the
imaginations of the perverters of the truth <span
id="fr_632"></span>[2](#fn_632) who have denied the Faith and made the
Qur’án discordant. <span id="fr_633"></span>[3](#fn_633) Verily after
life is the grave, 'and ye were not created in sport.' <span
id="fr_634"></span>[4](#fn_634) Therefore beware of the heat of
Hell-fire and hasten to the eternal home. Verily knowledge, whatever its
failings, is good, and ignorance is bad under all conditions. Ye are
surely the most wretched overshadowed by the heavens if, through you,
the learned are in distress, for men are judged by their leaders, and,
if the people are led by their influence, <span
id="fr_635"></span>[5](#fn_635) they are saved by their responsibility.

Men are divided into two classes, the observant scholar and the striving
student, as for the rest, they are abandoned ostriches and beasts
pasturing at pleasure. Woe to him of high degree commanded by one
beneath him, and woe to the knower of something who is ruled by one
ignorant of it! I have heard that ‘Alí ibn al-Ḥusain <span
id="fr_636"></span>[6](#fn_636) was standing admonishing the people and
saying: 'O soul, how long wilt thou rely upon life, and depend upon the
world and its building up? Hast thou not taken warning from those of thy
ancestors who have passed away, from

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

those of thy friends whom the earth has covered up, from those of thy
brethren who have been smitten, and from those of thy fellows who have
been transported to the house of decay?

In the bowels of the earth <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_637) are
they after having been upon its back.  
Their virtues decaying and forgotten therein.  
Their houses are emptied of them and their enclosures are void,  
And the Fates have driven them deathwards.  
They have left the world and what they had collected therein,  
And under the earth the pits have embraced them.'

How many ages, one after the other, have Death's hands snatched away,
and what changes have they produced by their calamities and how many
great men have they concealed beneath the dust!

'And thou art intent upon the world, <span
id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_638) vying  
With its suitors for her, covetous and boasting of thy superior
substance.  
Thou goest into danger and art unmindful.  
Didst thou but understand, wouldst thou not know to what danger thou
exposest thyself?  
And verily the man, who endeavours and strives after this world,  
And neglects the next, is without doubt a loser.'

Mark the dead nations and defunct kings, how the days overthrew them,
and death destroyed them, so that their traces have been obliterated
 <span id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_639) and but a tale of them remaineth.

'They are decayed in the dust <span id="fr_640"></span>[4](#fn_640) and
devoid  
Of them are the assemblies, and the spacious apartments have become
desolate.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

They have left the world and what they had collected therein,  
And none of them succeeded but the perseveringly patient.  
And they have alighted in an abode where there is no exchange of
visits;  
For how can there be intercourse between the tenants of the tomb?  
Thou seest nought but the level grave, in which they abide,  
And over which the whirlwind carries the dust.'

Many a man hast thou seen possessed of might and power, armies and
allies who has gained the world and obtained from it his desire. He
built fortresses and castles <span id="fr_641"></span>[1](#fn_641) and
collected precious things and forces.

'But the treasures diverted not death's hand <span
id="fr_642"></span>[2](#fn_642) when it appeared suddenly desiring
him.  
Nor did the fortresses surrounded by moats and the castles, which he had
built, protect him!  
No device overcame death for him, nor were his armies eager to defend
him.'

O people beware! beware! and hasten, O hasten away from the world and
her mischiefs, and from the traps she has laid for you, from her
appearing in her adornment before you and in her loveliness raising her
eyes towards you.

'But less affliction than thou seest <span
id="fr_643"></span>[3](#fn_643) sufficeth to summon thee to abandon it
and to exhort thee to piety.

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

So strive and be not negligent, for thy life is fleeting, and thou art
returning to the abode of death.  
And seek not the world, for the pursuit of it, even if thou obtainest
thy desire from it, injures thee.'

How can a wise man covet, or a sagacious person be pleased with it, when
he is sure of its perishing? Do ye not wonder at him who sleeps, while
he fears death, and hopeth not for escape?

'Nay, nay, but we delude our own souls <span
id="fr_644"></span>[1](#fn_644) and worldly delights preoccupy them to
the exclusion of what they apprehended.  
And how can he enjoy pleasure who is certain of the standing-place of
justice where all secret thoughts and actions shall be examined
into? <span id="fr_645"></span>[2](#fn_645)  
It is as though we thought there is no resurrection and that we are left
at liberty and that, after dissolution, there is no future state for
us.' <span id="fr_646"></span>[3](#fn_646)

How many of those, who have inclined towards it, hath the world
deceived, and many a one of those intent upon it has fallen, and it
raised him not from his stumbling, <span id="fr_647"></span>[4](#fn_647)
nor excused him for his falling. It healed him not of his sickness, nor
relieved him of his pain.

'Rather has it brought him down, <span id="fr_648"></span>[5](#fn_648)
after his possessing might and rank,  
To evil watering-places from which there is no climbing out. <span
id="fr_649"></span>[6](#fn_649)  
So when he saw there was no escape, and that

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

It was death, from which the helpers could not save him,  
He sought repentance, if length of repentance could avail him,  
And his heinous crimes caused him to weep.'

He wept over his past sins, and felt regret for what he was leaving of
the world, when weeping profited him not, and excuse delivered him not.

'His sorrows and cares encompassed him, <span
id="fr_650"></span>[1](#fn_650)  
And, when excuses baffled him, he despaired. <span
id="fr_651"></span>[2](#fn_651)  
Therefore he hath no saviour from the pains of death,  
Nor helper from that which is avoided.  
His throat rattled <span id="fr_652"></span>[3](#fn_652) before death,  
While the uvula and the larynx re-echoed it.'

How long wilt thou mend thy present condition at the expense of thy
future state, and, in so doing, ride upon thy desire? Verily I perceive
thee to be weak in assurance, O patcher of thy present condition with
thy religion. Has the merciful God commanded thee to do this, or the
Qur’án guided thee so?

'Thou destroyest that which remaineth, <span
id="fr_653"></span>[4](#fn_653) and buildest that which perisheth,  
But neither is this complete nor that abiding.  
If then thy end come suddenly upon thee,  
When thou hast acquired no good, hast thou an excuser with God?  
Art thou content that life should pass and end,  
While thy religion is deficient and thy wealth complete?'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: I asked one of those present: 'Who is this?' He
replied: 'A stranger who arrived by night? I

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

know him not personally, so wait for the end of his discourse, <span
id="fr_654"></span>[1](#fn_654) perhaps he will tell his name.' So I
waited. Then he said: 'Adorn knowledge with practice and show gratitude
for power by practising forgiveness. Take the clear and leave the
muddy. <span id="fr_655"></span>[2](#fn_655) May God forgive you and
me!' Then he started off. So I followed in his track and said to him: 'O
Shaikh, who art thou?' He replied: 'Good Gracious! art thou not
satisfied with pondering over externals, that thou madest for the truth
and then failed to recognize it? <span id="fr_656"></span>[3](#fn_656) I
am Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskánderí.'

I said: 'May God preserve thee, but what is this hoariness?' He
answered:--

'A warner, but a silent one, <span id="fr_657"></span>[4](#fn_657)  
And a guest, but a gloating one,  
The messenger of death, but  
Verily he will stay on <span id="fr_658"></span>[5](#fn_658) till I
accompany him.'  <span id="fr_659"></span>[6](#fn_659)

which does not belong to it. … is especially applied to the Esoterics

earth:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[106:2](mhm34.htm#fr_638) *And thou art intent
upon the world:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[106:3](mhm34.htm#fr_639) … *Their traces have
been obliterated:* Contrast this statement with the lines:

…

'These are our works (literally remains, or traces) which prove what we
have done, look, therefore, at our works when we are gone.'

<span id="fn_640"></span>[106:4](mhm34.htm#fr_640) *They are decayed in
the dust:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[107:1](mhm34.htm#fr_641) … *Castles:* Plural
of …Arabicized from Talmud. ‏דימקרהא‎ name of various villages, probably
originally from Διοσκουριας or the like, from Διοσκοῦροι (Stephanus
Byzanthinos). A country seat. See Bukhárí (edited by Krehl) i, 9. Also a
wine hall or saloon (Ḥarírí, i, 140). The word also occurs in the lines
of Ibn al-Ḥájib on the Aiwán (…) quoted by Yaqút, i, 426.

…

These pavilions, pleasure houses, buildings and castles of our Kisra
Anushirwán. It is probable Hamadhání had the Aiwán in mind when he
composed or quoted these lines.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[107:2](mhm34.htm#fr_642) *But the treasures
diverted not death's hand:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[107:3](mhm34.htm#fr_643) *But less affliction
than thou seest:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[108:1](mhm34.htm#fr_644) *Nay, nay, but we
delude our own souls:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[108:2](mhm34.htm#fr_645) *Secret thoughts and
actions shall be examined into:* An allusion to Qur’án, lxxxvi, 9.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[108:3](mhm34.htm#fr_646) … *Future state:*
Plural of … literally, a place or state to which a person or thing
eventually comes.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[108:4](mhm34.htm#fr_647) *It raised him not
from his stumbling:* Another and better reading: …. It excused him not
his stumbling, nor raised him from his falling.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[108:5](mhm34.htm#fr_648) *Rather has it
brought him down:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[108:6](mhm34.htm#fr_649) *From which there is

<span id="fn_650"></span>[109:1](mhm34.htm#fr_650) *His sorrows
encompassed him:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[109:2](mhm34.htm#fr_651) … *He despaired:* The
Muslim name for the Devil is said to be derived from this verb because
he despairs of God's mercy. Iblís is probably a corruption of diabolos.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[109:3](mhm34.htm#fr_652) *His throat rattled:*
From …; literally, he drove away a dog. The explanation of this sentence
seems to be, his soul fled before death while the uvula and the larynx
turned it back. Figurative for death throes.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[109:4](mhm34.htm#fr_653) *Thou destroyest that
which remaineth:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[110:1](mhm34.htm#fr_654) … *So wait for the
end of his discourse:* Here Hamadhání uses the word maqáma for a
religious discourse or sermon.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[110:2](mhm34.htm#fr_655) *Take the clear and
leave the muddy:* Take what is free from trouble and leave what is
attended therewith.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[110:3](mhm34.htm#fr_656) … *Failed to
recognize:* Literally, thou didst change it, that is thy mind.
Abú’l-Fat'? chides ‘Ísá ibn Hishám for thinking him to be some one else
when he knew who he was.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[110:4](mhm34.htm#fr_657) *A warner, but a
silent one:* Metre, *mutaqárib*.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[110:5](mhm34.htm#fr_658) … *will stay on:*
Unlike any ordinary messenger who delivers his message and departs.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[110:6](mhm34.htm#fr_659) An excellent example
of a sermon in rhymed prose and verse on the vanity of human life and
the certainty of death and judgement, of which the eleventh maqáma of
Ḥarírí is a close imitation. There is little reference to future reward
or punishment. Cf. Ḥarírí, i, 14 and 121.
