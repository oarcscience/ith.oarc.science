### XXXIV. THE MAQAMA OF FRESH BUTTER

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I turned aside with a few <span
id="fr_812"></span>[2](#fn_812.md) of my friends to the front of a tent to
ask hospitality from its occupants, and there came out to us a portly
little man <span id="fr_813"></span>[3](#fn_813.md) and asked: 'Who are
you?' We replied: 'Guests who have tasted nothing for three nights.' He
related: 'He coughed and then said: "O young men! What do you say to
fresh butter of the flock, like the head of a bald man, in a broad
shallow dish adorned with the dates of Khaibar, <span
id="fr_814"></span>[4](#fn_814.md) taken from the bunch of a branch of a
tall, young, and large palm-tree? One of them would fill the mouth of
one of a hungry company five days without water; <span
id="fr_815"></span>[5](#fn_815.md) the tooth is lost in it, and its stone
is like

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

the tongue of a bird, and they scoop up the butter with it, taken with
deep wooden drinking-bowls of milk drawn from good milking-camels
pastured on *haram* <span id="fr_816"></span>[1](#fn_816.md) and
*rabl*. <span id="fr_817"></span>[2](#fn_817.md) O young men, do ye like
it?"' We answered: 'Yes, by Heavens! we like it.' 'Ha, ha,' laughed the
old man, 'Your uncle also likes it.' Then he said: 'O young men! What is
your opinion of white flour like unto a piece of molten silver collected
on a round piece of hide with the odour of the qaraz̤? <span
id="fr_818"></span>[3](#fn_818.md) From among you one springs forward, a
young, comely and active man, and mixes it without violently disturbing
or scattering it. Then he leaves it before it is well kneaded. After a
while he mixes it thoroughly with milk, more or less diluted with water.
He next proceeds to work it up and then leaves it around the pan <span
id="fr_819"></span>[4](#fn_819.md) till it is leavened without becoming
dry; then he betakes himself to the *ghaḍa* <span
id="fr_820"></span>[5](#fn_820.md) wood and kindles it. Then, when the fire
subsides, he spreads it over his oven, <span
id="fr_821"></span>[6](#fn_821.md) goes to his dough, flattens it out,
after he has well kneaded it, lays it upon the hot ashes and then covers
it up.'

'Then, when it has dried and risen, <span
id="fr_822"></span>[7](#fn_822.md) he places on it hot stones sufficient to
unite the two heats. <span id="fr_823"></span>[8](#fn_823.md) He covers
them up over the bread, in the form of a round plate, until it cracks
and splits and its crust resembles that of a circular cake, and its

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

brownness <span id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_824.md) looks like that of the
Ḥijáz date, <span id="fr_825"></span>[2](#fn_825.md) famous as Umm
al-Jirdhán <span id="fr_826"></span>[3](#fn_826.md) or ‘Idq ibn Ṭáb. <span
id="fr_827"></span>[4](#fn_827.md) Wild honey, white as snow, is then
poured over it till it penetrates the brown crust <span
id="fr_828"></span>[5](#fn_828.md) and the pith absorbs all it has upon it.
It is then brought before you, and you gobble it with the gobbling of
Juwain, <span id="fr_829"></span>[6](#fn_829.md) or Zankal. <span
id="fr_830"></span>[7](#fn_830.md) Young men, do you desire it?' He
related: 'Each one of us stretched his neck towards what he had
described, his mouth watered and he licked his lips and smacked them,'
and we answered: 'Yes, by Heavens! we like it.' 'Ha! ha!' laughed the
old man, and said: 'And your uncle, by Heavens! does not hate it.' Then
he said: 'What is your opinion, O young men, of a wild she-kid of Nejd
and Aliya <span id="fr_831"></span>[8](#fn_831.md) which has fed upon the
artemisia Judaica of Nejd, the artemisia abrotanum and hashim, <span
id="fr_832"></span>[9](#fn_832.md) nibbled at the thick herbage and is
filled with tender grass? Her marrow is abundant, her inner membrane is
covered with fat <span id="fr_833"></span>[10](#fn_833.md) and she has been
slaughtered without blemish. Next it is suspended head downwards in an
oven till it is perfectly baked without being either burnt or underdone,
and then it is placed before you with its skin cracked, exposing white
fat, on a table with thin cakes disposed thereon, as though they were
unfolded Egyptian linen, or fine cloth of Kohistán coloured with red
clay. It is surrounded with vessels containing mustard

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

and raisin sauce <span id="fr_834"></span>[1](#fn_834.md) and divers kinds
of fluid seasonings. <span id="fr_835"></span>[2](#fn_835.md) Then it is
served to you exuding fat and dripping with gravy. O young men, do you
like it?' We replied: 'Yes, by Heavens! we like it.' He said: 'And your
uncle, by Heavens! will dance for it.' Then one of us sprang towards him
with a sword and said: 'Does not our hunger suffice thee that thou
mockest us?' Then his daughter brought us a tray upon which were a piece
of dry bread, scraps and leavings, and she entertained us well. So we
departed, praising her and blaming him.

man:* Literally, large-bellied and short, short in step, or a niggard. I
think Hamadhání had both meanings in his mind; the man's appearance

coughing and on p. 187 of the text we find that coughing is indicative
of a disinclination to give. Cf. also Text, p. 218: 'O coughing of the

meadows, and numerous groves of palm-trees. It was noted for the
abundance and excellence of its dates. Cf. the line of Ḥassan ibn Thábit
quoted by Yaqút, ii, 505.

'Verily as for us, he who presents *qasídas* to us,  
Is like him who exports dates to the land of Khaibar.'

In A.H., 6 or 7, Muḥammad made himself master of the place and all its
castles and strongholds, and took spoils to a great value. Yaqút, ii,

This maqáma is remarkable for its collection of recondite words and
technical terms; the disquisition on Bedawín baking being extremely
difficult to render into English. The conventional concluding lines of
poetry are wanting.
