### XXXVII. THE MAQAMA OF THE NAJIM

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I passed a night with a
company <span id="fr_871"></span>[4](#fn_871.md) of clever men of my
friends. We discussed chaste speech, and we had not bidden farewell to
the conversation when our door was knocked at. So I asked: 'Who is the
nocturnal visitor?' He answered: 'The envoy of night and its messenger.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The defeated of
hunger and its outcast, and an exile whose beast is lean and fatigued,
whose life is hardship, and between whom and his two chicks are vast
deserts. A guest whose shadow is light, <span
id="fr_872"></span>[1](#fn_872.md) and whose stray is a loaf. Is there,
therefore, among you a host?' So we hastened to open the door, we made
his camel kneel down, concentrated his purpose, and said to him: 'To
thine own house hast thou come, and thine own people hast thou reached,
and come into the house.' We smiled upon him, welcomed him, and showed
him his stray. We helped him till he was sated, and we talked to him
until he became friendly, and then we asked: 'Who is this star rising
from his orient, the bewitcher with his diction?' He answered, 'None
knows the wood like the biter. <span id="fr_873"></span>[2](#fn_873.md) I
am popularly known as the Nájim. <span id="fr_874"></span>[3](#fn_874.md) I
have associated with Time that I might test it. I have extracted its
essences, and milked all its teats. <span
id="fr_875"></span>[4](#fn_875.md) I have tried the people that I might
know them--and I know the lean and the fat among them--and exile that I
might taste it. No country has looked at me whose eye I have not plucked
out <span id="fr_876"></span>[5](#fn_876.md), and there is no gathering
together of friends that I have not entered. Therefore I am talked of in
the east and I am not repudiated in the west. There is not a king whose
carpet I have not trodden upon, no serious situation whose flank <span
id="fr_877"></span>[6](#fn_877.md) I have not penetrated, and no war has
ceased in which I have not been an envoy. Time has tried me in its two
phases, ease and distress, and it has met me with its two faces, the
smiling and the frowning, but I exposed not myself to its hardship save
in its own garb. <span id="fr_878"></span>[7](#fn_878.md)

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

And if the changing of Time <span id="fr_879"></span>[1](#fn_879.md)
formerly injured me,  
And loaded me with its evil-accidents what it loads with,  
It verily brought benevolence when it set me down  
In a good place from which there is no removal.'

We said: 'May thy teeth not be broken! <span
id="fr_880"></span>[2](#fn_880.md) How excellent art thou and thy father!
Silence is not unlawful except to thee, and speech is not lawful save to
thee. Whence hast thou risen and where dost thou set? What is that which
impels thy desire before thee and drives thy object in front of thee?'
He said: 'As for the native land, it is Yemen as regards the need it is
the rain, and as for the motive it is distress and the bitter life.'
Said we: 'If thou wouldst but stay in this place we would share our life
with thee and all else. Thou wouldst get rain with which to cultivate,
and heavy downpours from the rain-stars <span
id="fr_881"></span>[3](#fn_881.md) deep enough to drink from, without using
hand or vessel.' He said: 'I will not prefer any companions to you, for
I have found your court spacious, but your rain is water and water
quencheth not the thirsty.' So we asked: 'What rains will satisfy thee?'
He answered: 'The rain of Khalaf.' And he indited saying:--

'O fleet camel! To Sijistan! <span id="fr_882"></span>[4](#fn_882.md)  
And to the ocean to whose shores desires repair.  
If thou visit Arján, <span id="fr_883"></span>[5](#fn_883.md) thou wilt go
to it,

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

Desiring one and wilt return with a hundred complete,  
And the superiority of the Amír over Ibn al-‘Amíd <span
id="fr_884"></span>[1](#fn_884.md)  
Is like that of the Quraish <span id="fr_885"></span>[2](#fn_885.md) over
Báhila!' <span id="fr_886"></span>[3](#fn_886.md)

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: Then he went forth and we bade him farewell. After
he had gone we continued a long while wishing for him, while his absence
pained us. Now one cloudy day we were seated together like the string of
the Pleiades, when suddenly mounts were driven, led horses were brought
up, and lo! a man ran in upon us. We asked: 'Who is the intruder?' and
behold it was our Shaikh, the Nájim, walking proudly in the guise of
realized desires and in the skirts of wealth. We arose, and, embracing
him, asked: 'What is behind thee, O ‘Iṣám?' <span
id="fr_887"></span>[4](#fn_887.md) He answered: 'Laden camels, loaded mules
and locked bags.' And he indited saying:--

'O my master, <span id="fr_888"></span>[5](#fn_888.md) what base thing is
there that Khalaf doth not disapprove of? <span
id="fr_889"></span>[6](#fn_889.md)  
And what good thing is there that he doth not attain to?  
The seekers of largess hear no word save "Take it",  
And he is not answered, save by "Give it".

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

Verily noble deeds disclosed their faces fair,  
And he was the mole on their cheeks.  
May my father be a ransom for his qualities which manifest greatness,  
And for the hand in whose movements thou seest blessings!  
Whoever counts them the benefactions of the age, verily I  
Am one of those that reckon the age to be one of their benefactions.'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: We asked God to spare him and to bless us with his
company. And the Nájim stayed for days restricting his tongue to
expressing gratitude for his <span id="fr_890"></span>[1](#fn_890.md)
kindness, and employing not his speech save in praising his days and
talking of his gifts.'

Literally, the Rising Star.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[145:4](mhm45.htm#fr_875.md) … *I have milked all
its teats:* Freytag, *Arab Proverbs*, i, 346. A figure for having
experienced varieties of fortune, its straitness and its ampleness, as
compared to one who has milked all the teats of the camel, that which
yields plenty and that which does not.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[145:5](mhm45.htm#fr_876.md) … *Plucked out its
eye:* That is, trod its surface.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[145:6](mhm45.htm#fr_877.md) … *Its flank:*
Literally, its rank.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[145:7](mhm45.htm#fr_878.md) … *In its garb:* Cf.
the saying of Baihas. … 'Wear for every condition its proper dress,'
also, Hamasa (edited by Freytag), p, 510.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[146:1](mhm45.htm#fr_879.md) *And if the changing
of Time:* Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[146:2](mhm45.htm#fr_880.md) *May thy teeth*
(literally mouth) *not be broken*: The phrase as used by the Prophet,
is: … May God not break thy mouth.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[146:3](mhm45.htm#fr_881.md) … *The rain-stars:*
pl. of … The literal meaning of … is the setting in the early morning of
one of the twenty-eight mansions of the moon, or … while the opposite
constellation, called its … or watcher, was rising. The auroral settings
of these constellations served among the Arabs to denote the seasons of
rain, wind, or heat. Just as among the Greeks and Latins the setting of
the Hyads or the rising of Sirius indicated particular states of the
weather. As the Arabs in their observations of the seasons thought
chiefly of rain, which was to moisten their parched fields, the word …
became equivalent with rain. *Ḥarírí*, i, 215. The belief of the Arabs
of the Ignorance that the rain was produced by the settings of the stars
was discouraged by Muslim teachers; and from an anecdote related of
‘Umar (See Lane, Article …) the Khalífa seems to have considered that
the supply of rain was a sign that sins were pardoned, basing his
opinion on Qur’án, lxxi, 10. Chenery's Translation of *Ḥarírí*, i,
443-5.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[146:4](mhm45.htm#fr_882.md) *O fleet camel! To
Sijistan*: Metre, *mutaqárib*.

<span id="fn_883"></span>[146:5](mhm45.htm#fr_883.md) *Arjan* and
*Arrajan:* a large town in Seistan, sixty parasangs from Shiráz, famous
for its palm-trees, olive groves and fruits.

<span id="fn_884"></span>[147:1](mhm45.htm#fr_884.md) *Ibn al-‘Amíd* (ob.
A.H. 359 or 360).

<span id="fn_885"></span>[147:2](mhm45.htm#fr_885.md) *Is like that of the
Quraish over Báhila*. This was praise indeed. Abú’l-Faḍl Muḥammad Ibn
al-‘Amíd, Wazír of Rukn Al-Daula, the Buwayhid prince, was one of the
great men of the fourth century of the Hijra. He was a versatile and an
accomplished scholar and was called a second Jáḥiz. Tha‘álibí says
(Yatíma, iii, 3) that epistolary writing began with ‘Abd al-Ḥamid (d.
A.H. 133) Kátib, or secretary, to Marwán the last of the Umayyad
Khalífas, and ended with Ibn al-'Amíd. Among those who studied the
epistolary art under him was the Ṣáḥib Ibn ‘Abbád. As Wazír, his
authority and influence were unbounded. (Ibn Khallikan, iii, 256; also
*Der Islám*, iii, 323-5, were a full notice of the Wazír by H. F.
Ahmedroz will be found.)

<span id="fn_886"></span>[147:3](mhm45.htm#fr_886.md) *Báhila:* The meanest
of the Arab tribes. The Arabs who were members of this tribe had an
extreme repugnance to bearing this surname. A poet has said: 'If the
words, "thou Bahilite" were addressed to a dog he would howl from the
ignominy of such an appellation.' (Ibn Khallikan, ii, 518.) For a
further example of this repugnance, see *Aghání*, vii, 12.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[147:4](mhm45.htm#fr_887.md) …. *What is behind
thee, ‘Iṣám:* Freytag, *Arab Proverbs*, ii, 589. Said to have been first
used by Ḥárith ibn ‘Amr king of Kindeh and addressed to ‘Iṣám, a clever
Kindite woman, whom he had sent to bring a description of the beautiful
and gifted daughter of 'Owf ibn Muhallam, Al-Shaibání whom he wished to
marry. This proverb is said to have another origin, see Chenery's
Translation of *Ḥarírí*, i, 519.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[147:5](mhm45.htm#fr_888.md) *O my master:* Metre,
*kámil*.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[147:6](mhm45.htm#fr_889.md) *Doth not disapprove
of:* Page 195, line 7 of Text, for … read ….

<span id="fn_890"></span>[148:1](mhm45.htm#fr_890.md) *His*, i.e. Khalaf's,
*kindness*. The part of this Maqáma where the Nájim describes himself
has much in common with the fourth Maqáma, pp. 16, 17.
