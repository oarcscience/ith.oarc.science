### XLII. THE MAQAMA OF SAIMARA

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: Said Muḥammad ibn Isḥáq,
popularly known as Abú’l-‘Anbas of Ṣaimara: <span
id="fr_931"></span>[1](#fn_931.md) 'Of the things that have come down to me
from my brethren whom I chose, selected, and stored up against
calamities, wherein was a matter which has in it admonition, warning and
education for such persons as will take them, that it is to say, I was
coming from Ṣaimara to the City of Peace and I had bags of dinars,
furniture, equipment, etc., on account of which I needed no one. So I
associated with people of great families, secretaries of state.,
merchants, leading men of fame, from among men of wealth, fortune, and
opulence, and owners of estates; a company that I selected for social
intercourse and treasured for adversity.'

And we ceased not indulging in the morning and the evening draughts,
feeding on sucking-kids, Persian omelets <span
id="fr_932"></span>[2](#fn_932.md) minced meat *a la Ibráhím*, <span
id="fr_933"></span>[3](#fn_933.md) pungent fried meats, kabob <span
id="fr_934"></span>[4](#fn_934.md) *a la Rashíd*, <span
id="fr_935"></span>[5](#fn_935.md) and lamb. And our drink was mead, and
our singing was by beautiful and skilled ladies of world renown. Our
dessert was peeled almonds, sugar, and sugar-candy. <span
id="fr_936"></span>[6](#fn_936.md) And our sweet-smelling flower was the
rose and our perfume was *Nad*. And because of my liberality, my
generosity and the squandering of my store, I was, in their opinion,
wiser than ‘Abd-Alláh ibn

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> ‘Abbás, <span
id="fr_937"></span>[1](#fn_937.md) wittier than Abú Núwás, more generous
than Haṭim, <span id="fr_938"></span>[2](#fn_938.md) braver than
‘Amr, <span id="fr_939"></span>[3](#fn_939.md) more eloquent than Saḥbán
Wá’il, <span id="fr_940"></span>[4](#fn_940.md) more artful than
Qáṣír, <span id="fr_941"></span>[5](#fn_941.md) a greater poet than Jarír,
sweeter than the water of the Euphrates, and more delightful than
health. <span id="fr_942"></span>[6](#fn_942.md) But, when the cargo became
light, the sails collapsed, and the bag was empty, the company hastened
to the door, when they perceived the fact.

Disgust <span id="fr_943"></span>[7](#fn_943.md) entered their hearts and
they called me Burṣeh, <span id="fr_944"></span>[8](#fn_944.md)

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

and they arose with alacrity to flee, like shooting sparks of fire.
Vexation took possession of them and they slipped away drop by
drop, <span id="fr_945"></span>[1](#fn_945.md) and they dispersed right and
left and I remained on the floor. <span id="fr_946"></span>[2](#fn_946.md)
They bequeathed to me regret, and, because of them, tears overwhelmed
me. I was not worth a piece of dung, alone, solitary, like the owl
branded with ill-luck, sitting down and standing up as if the state in
which I had been had never been.

And I repented when repentance availed me not. Therefore was my
comeliness changed to wildness. A deafness came over me worse than that
of Rahta the crier. As though I were a monk of the people of
al-Ḥíra. <span id="fr_947"></span>[3](#fn_947.md) The property had gone and
derision was left, and there was in my hand only the she-goat's
tail. <span id="fr_948"></span>[4](#fn_948.md) I found myself in my house
alone, with my liver crushed, because of the fall of my fortune. My
tears had furrowed my cheek. I dwelt in an abode whose ruins had been
obliterated and whose traces the torrents had effaced, and where the
wild beasts roamed and strayed morning and evening. My position had
gone, my substance was exhausted and my comfort <span
id="fr_949"></span>[5](#fn_949.md) was diminished. My boon-companions and
my old friends deserted me. No head was raised for me and I was not
reckoned among the people. More contemptible than Baz‘í the
pottage-maker and Warzín the rope-maker. I wandered to and fro on the
river bank as if I were a keeper of ducks. <span
id="fr_950"></span>[6](#fn_950.md) I walked barefoot,

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

scouring the deserts. <span id="fr_951"></span>[1](#fn_951.md) My eye was
inflamed and my life was in pledge, as though I were a madman escaped
from a cell, or an ass going around the enclosure.

I was sadder than al-Khansa <span id="fr_952"></span>[2](#fn_952.md) over
Ṣakhr, and Hind <span id="fr_953"></span>[3](#fn_953.md) over ‘Amr. My
reason was lost, my health was good for nothing, my purse was empty and
my slave had fled. My evil dreams multiplied and in evil suggestions I
exceeded the limit. I became like the Jinn that inhabit houses and the
evil spirit of the dwelling. I appeared in the night and hid in the day.
I was unluckier than the grave-digger, more burdensome than the rent of
the house, more stupid that Ṭíṭí the bleacher, and more foolish than
Dáúd the oil-presser. Scantiness had become my ally and abjectness had
encompassed me. And I was outside the pale of the community and hated
for the sake of God. I had been Abú’l-‘Anbas <span
id="fr_954"></span>[4](#fn_954.md) and I became Abú
‘[‘Aflas](errata.htm#9) <span id="fr_955"></span>[5](#fn_955.md) and Abú
Faq‘as. I had lost the road, and argument was against me.

I found no helper and I saw destitution before me. Now, when I perceived
the affair had become difficult and that Time had the rabies, I
solicited money and behold it was with the two vultures <span
id="fr_956"></span>[6](#fn_956.md) and at the parting of the two
seas, <span id="fr_957"></span>[7](#fn_957.md) and more remote

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

than the two pointers. So I started wandering, as though I was the
Messiah, <span id="fr_958"></span>[1](#fn_958.md) and I journeyed over
Khurásán, its deserted and populous parts, to Kirman, Sijistan, Jílan,
Tabaristan, ‘Oman, to Sind and India, to Nubia and Egypt, Yemen, Ḥijáz,
Mecca and al-Ṭa‘if. I roamed over deserts and wastes, seeking warmth at
the fire and taking shelter with the ass, till both my cheeks were
blackened. And thus I collected of anecdotes and fables, <span
id="fr_959"></span>[2](#fn_959.md) witticisms and traditions, poems of the
humourists, the diversions of the frivolous, the fabrications of the
lovesick, the saws of the pseudo-philosophers, the tricks of the
conjurors, <span id="fr_960"></span>[3](#fn_960.md) the artifices of the
artful, the rare sayings of convivial companions, the fraud of the
astrologers, the finesse of quacks, the deception of the effeminate, the
guile of the cheats, <span id="fr_961"></span>[4](#fn_961.md) the devilry
of the fiends, such that the legal decisions of al-Sh‘abí, <span
id="fr_962"></span>[5](#fn_962.md) the memory of al-Ḍabbí <span
id="fr_963"></span>[6](#fn_963.md) and the learning of al-Kalbí <span
id="fr_964"></span>[7](#fn_964.md) would have fallen short of.

And I solicited gifts and asked for presents. I had recourse to
influence and I begged. I eulogized and satirized, till I acquired much
property, got possession of Indian swords and Yemen blades, fine coats
of mail of Sábur <span id="fr_965"></span>[8](#fn_965.md) and leathern
shields

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

of Tibet, spears of al-Khaṭṭ <span id="fr_966"></span>[1](#fn_966.md) and
javelins of Barbary, excellent fleet horses with short coats, Armenian
mules, and Mirris <span id="fr_967"></span>[2](#fn_967.md) asses, silk
brocades of Rúm and woollen stuffs <span id="fr_968"></span>[3](#fn_968.md)
of Sús. <span id="fr_969"></span>[4](#fn_969.md) Various kinds of curios,
presents, offerings, and gifts, with prosperity and opulence.

Now, when I arrived at Baghdad and the people got news of me, and of how
I had been prospered in my travels, they were delighted at my arrival,
and they all came to me complaining of what loneliness they had
experienced on account of my being away, and what had happened to them
because of my absence, and they complained of the intensity of longing
and the pain of yearning. And each of them began to apologize for what
he had done and to manifest regret for what he had committed. So I made
them think I had forgiven them and I did not exhibit to them a sign of
vindictiveness because of their conduct. Therefore they were pleased,
their limbs ceased trembling, and they went away in that belief.

The next day they returned to me and I detained them with me. Then I
dispatched my agent to the market and he did not omit a thing of all
that I had charged him to buy. We had a skilful female cook, and I got
prepared twenty sorts of pungent fried-meats, divers kinds of omelets,
and rare preparations. We ate and then adjourned to the drinking-saloon,
and there were presented before them bright and clear old wine <span
id="fr_970"></span>[5](#fn_970.md) and fair and expert singers.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

They betook themselves to their task and we drank, and there passed for
us the pleasantest day. Now I had prepared, according to their number,
fifteen brinjal baskets, each basket with four handles. <span
id="fr_971"></span>[1](#fn_971.md) And my slave had hired for each one of
them a porter, each porter at two dirhems, and he had informed the
porters of the houses of the company, and charged them to present
themselves the next evening. And I commanded my slave, who was a crafty
one, to give the company to drink by the pint and by the quart, <span
id="fr_972"></span>[2](#fn_972.md) and to serve them while I fumigated
before them with nad, aloes and ambergris. Before an hour had passed
they <span id="fr_973"></span>[3](#fn_973.md) were all dead drunk and
unconscious. Their slaves came to us at sunset each one with a horse, or
an ass, or a mule, but I told them their masters were passing the night
with me and so they went away. Then I sent for Bilál, the barber, and I
brought him in. I placed food before him and he ate. I gave him wine of
Qutrubbul and he drank till he became intoxicated. Then I placed in his
mouth two yellow dinars <span id="fr_974"></span>[4](#fn_974.md) and said,
'Do your duty to the company.' And in a single hour he shaved off
fifteen beards, and the company became as smooth-faced as the denizens
of Paradise. <span id="fr_975"></span>[5](#fn_975.md)

I placed the beard of each one of them pursed in his clothes and with it
a letter wherein was written, 'Whoever harbours perfidy against his
friend and forsakes faithfulness, this is his recompense and reward,'
and I put it in his pocket. Then we tied them up in the baskets. The
porters came the next evening and carried them off with a losing return
and they reached their homes. But, when they arose in the morning, they
perceived in themselves great grief. Not a merchant from among them went
forth to his shop, not a clerk to his office, nor could he appear before
his brethren. And every day a large crowd of their

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

dependents, women, boys and men, came and reviled and reproached me, and
invoked upon me divine judgement, but I remained silent and did not
return them an answer, nor did I heed their words. The news of my
treatment of them spread over the City of Peace, and the matter ceased
not to magnify until it reached the Wazír al-Qasim ibn
‘Ubeid-Alláh, <span id="fr_976"></span>[1](#fn_976.md) in this wise. He
wanted his clerk but failed to find him and it was reported: 'He is at
home and unable to go out.' He asked: 'Why?' And it was said: 'Because
of what Abú’l-‘Anbas has done to him for he had the misfortune of being
associated with and tried by him.' He laughed heartily and said: 'By
Heavens he was perfectly right to do what he did, <span
id="fr_977"></span>[2](#fn_977.md) let him alone, for he understands them
best.' Then he sent me a splendid robe of honour, had led to me a horse
with a carriage and forwarded to me fifty thousand dirhems as a mark of
his admiration of my action. I stayed at home for two months, spending,
eating and drinking and then I appeared in public, after concealment,
and some of them reconciled themselves to me because of what the Wazír
had done; and another swore by the triple divorce <span
id="fr_978"></span>[3](#fn_978.md) and by the emancipation of his slaves,
male and female, that he would never again speak directly to me. By God,
whose dignity is great, and whose evidence is exalted! I did not make
much of that, nor did I care, nor was the lobe of my ear scratched, nor
did my stomach ache. Neither did it injure me, rather did it delight me,
and 'it was a need in Jacob's soul which he

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

performed.' <span id="fr_979"></span>[1](#fn_979.md) And verily I have only
called attention to this that people may be on their guard against the
sons of the time, and give up depending on sordid and base brethren, and
upon so-and-so, the copyist, the calumniator, the great deceiver who
repudiates the claims of the cultured, makes light of them and borrows
their books and does not return them. And we implore God's aid and we
rely upon Him.

Alláh ibn ‘Abbás, cousin to Muḥammad, was born at Mecca A. D. 619, three
years before the Hijra. He was the ablest of the expounders of the
Qur’án in his time and the most liberal of the early Muslims. He was
remarkable for his great knowledge, acuteness and prodigious memory. It
was due to his efforts that the study of pre-Islámic poetry became of
such importance to the Muslims, for he frequently quoted verses of the
ancient poets in proof of the explanations he gave of difficult passages
of the Qur’án. He used to say: 'Whenever you meet with a difficulty in
the Qur’án look for its solution in the poems of the Arabs, for these
are the registers of the Arab nation.' He was for some time governor of
Baṣra under the Khalífa ‘Alí; died at al-Ṭaif A.H. 68. Ibn Khallikan, i,
89.

name became proverbial for eloquence like that of Qoss, Bishop of
Najran. He was born in the time of Muḥammad and died in the year A.H. 54
(A.D. 673). One of the earliest extant specimens of an Arab Khutba, or
sermon in rhymed prose, is by Saḥbán. This sermon contains the usual
incentives to morality founded on the shortness of life and the
certainty of future reward and punishment. Freytag, *Arab Proverbs*, i,
450. See De Sacy, *Ḥarírí*, i, 49 and Chenery's Translation of *Ḥarírí*,
p. 309.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[157:5](mhm50.htm#fr_941.md) *More artful than
Qáṣír:* Qáṣír was a freedman of Júdhíma al-Abrash, the king of ‘Iráq.
His master having been treacherously murdered by Queen Zebba (Zenobie)
he determined to revenge his death on her. He cut off his nose with his
own hand and complained to the Queen that ‘Amr, the murdered Jadhíma's
nephew, had done this, because he suspected him of complicity in the
betrayal of his master. So plausible a story found ready acceptance with
the queen. In this way he gained her confidence and was frequently sent
to ‘Iráq to bring her some of the rare products of that province until,
eventually, he contrived to introduce in boxes, supposed to contain
goods, a number of armed men who fell upon the queen and slew her. This
act of self-mutilation gave rise to the proverb: 'For some purpose Qáṣír
cut off his nose.' *Ḥarírí*, i, 327.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[157:6](mhm50.htm#fr_942.md) … *More delightful
than health:* Cf. the proverb … More delightful than life. Meidaní, i,

the animal's cry, of a leprous hue as its name (…) indicates, but in

circumstances.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[161:3](mhm50.htm#fr_968.md) … *Khaz, A woollen
stuff*. A cloth woven of wool and silk said to be arabicized from the
Persian … Qaz, raw silk.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[161:4](mhm50.htm#fr_969.md) … *Sús:* A district
in Ahwaz. There are several places of this name given in Yaqút, iii,
189.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[161:5](mhm50.htm#fr_970.md) … *Old wine:* Dozy
calls it *Vin Grec*. It may therefore be arabicized from the Greek
χὸνδρος, groats of wheat, a mucilaginous drink made of groats of wheat.
The expressions …, old wheat and … old dates are suggestive as
referring, by an extension of meaning, to the kind of wheat and date
suitable for making wine. See Gawálíkí, *Almu‘arrab*, p. 55.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[162:1](mhm50.htm#fr_971.md) … *Handles:*
Literally, ears.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[162:2](mhm50.htm#fr_972.md) … *By the pint and by
the quart:* A *mann* equals 2 lbs. troy and a ran 1 lb. avoirdupois.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[162:3](mhm50.htm#fr_973.md) … *They:* That is,
the company.

<span id="fn_974"></span>[162:4](mhm50.htm#fr_974.md) … *Yellow:*
Literally, red.

<span id="fn_975"></span>[162:5](mhm50.htm#fr_975.md) … *As the denizens of
Paradise:* An allusion to the tradition which says the people of
Paradise are … having no hair upon their bodies and beardless (Lane. p.
407).

<span id="fn_976"></span>[163:1](mhm50.htm#fr_976.md) *Al-Qasim ibn
‘Ubeid-Alláh:* If we accept Yaqút's statement (*Geographical
Dictionary*, iii, 443; *Dictionary of Learned Men*, vi, 401) that
Abú’l-‘Anbas died A.H. 275, this is chronologically impossible. Al-Qasim
ibn ‘Ubeid-Alláh ibn Suleiman ibn Wahb was appointed Wazír in A.H. 288,
so that the Wazír referred to in the narrative must have been al-Qasim's
father ‘Ubeid-Alláh ibn Suleiman ibn Wahb the Wazír of Mu‘tamid and
Mu‘taḍid.

It was this al-Qasim ‘Ubeid-Alláh who poisoned Ibn al-Rúmí (see note on
p. 116), because he dreaded the poet's-satirical attacks. Here again
there is some confusion of dates. Ibn Khallikan, ii, 299, gives the date
of Ibn al-Rúmí's death as 284 or 276, whereas al-Qasim ibn ‘Ubeid-Alláh
was not appointed Wazír until his father's death which took place in
A.H. 288. See al-Fakhrí (edited by Ahlwardt), pp. 301-3.

<span id="fn_977"></span>[163:2](mhm50.htm#fr_977.md) … *He was perfectly
right to do what he did:* Literally, he hit and did not miss in what he
did.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[163:3](mhm50.htm#fr_978.md) … *By the triple
divorce:* 'Ye may divorce your wives twice, but, if the husband divorce
her a third time she shall not be lawful for him again until she marry
another husband.' Qur’án, ii, 229, 230.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[164:1](mhm50.htm#fr_979.md) *It was a need in
Jacob's soul which he performed:* Qur’án, xii, 67, 68. When Jacob's sons
went the second time down into Egypt taking Benjamin with them, their
father commanded them not to enter all at the same gate but at several.
This is explained to mean that, because of their personal beauty and the
favour shown them by the governor, if they all entered by the
[same](errata.htm#11.md) gate, they might be smitten with the evil eye.
This they did and, though they could not have changed God's will
concerning them, still it satisfied a desire in Jacob's mind. Baiḍáwí's
commentary (Fleischer), i, 466.

Abú’l-‘Anbas died eighty-three years before Hamadhání was born. It is
evident, therefore, that this maqáma is founded on a popular story,
handed down from the former, or extracted from one of the numerous works
of a humourous character he is said to have composed.

This lengthy maqáma contains no poetry.

Cf. Shakespeare, *Timon of Athens;* the themes are identical.
