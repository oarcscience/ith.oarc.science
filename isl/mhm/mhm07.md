The Maqámát of Badí‘ al-Zamán al-Hamadhání, tr. W.J. Prendergast
\[1915\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### IV. ORIGIN AND CHARACTER OF THE MAQAMAT

IN the first century of Islám there were scarcely any books and
knowledge was handed down orally. In fact there was, till well

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

within the second century of the Hijra, a decided antipathy towards the
written word <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) and those who desired
to learn the traditions of the Prophet were obliged to travel. <span
id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_81.md) Indeed the only way knowledge could be had
was by travelling.

Those who wished to study Arabic philosophy, poetry, legend and the
idiom of the desert were obliged to pursue their researches and
investigations among the Bedawín tribes. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[3](#fn_82.md)

Travel in search of knowledge thus rendered necessary at first by
circumstance became the fashion not only for the acquisition of
knowledge, but also for the dissemination and display thereof. It thus
led to the evolution of the vagabond scholar, a kind of knight-errant of
literature and the prototype of the medieval wandering man of learning.

Inspired by such examples of peripatetic scholars as well as by his own
wanderings and varied experience, <span id="fr_83"></span>[4](#fn_83.md)
Hamadhání imagined a profoundly clever and witty but unscrupulous
improvisor wandering from place to place, appearing in a variety of
disguises unexpectedly, but always opportunely, in the gatherings of the
great and the literary assemblies of the learned and living on the rich
presents, <span id="fr_84"></span>[5](#fn_84.md) the display of his
erudition rarely failed to produce from the generous and the cultured,
and a ráwí, or narrator, a man of means of mature age, of a grave and
generous disposition with a penchant for learning who should continually
meet him and relate his learned compositions.

Abú’l-Fatḥ, therefore, represents the vagabond scholar of Hamadhání's
own day, and, one is inclined to believe, occasionally the author
himself relating his own experiences or personal adventures. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[6](#fn_85.md)

The conception was an advance to the dramatic style which, on account of
the religious objection to the portrayal or realistic representation of
life or the human form, had hitherto been wanting in Arabic
literature. <span id="fr_86"></span>[7](#fn_86.md)

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

According to the Zahr al-Adáb the occasion of the composing of the
Maqámát was as follows: Abú Isḥáq, <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md)
surnamed al-Ḥuṣrí, or the maker or seller of mats (ob. at Qairawán A.H.
413). contemporary with Hamadhání, after referring in the most
flattering terms to the unique appropriateness of the author's name and
appellation, Abú’l Faḍl and Badí ‘al-Zamán, the 'Father of Excellence'
and the 'Wonder of the Age' respectively., writes: 'When al-Hamadhání
observed that Abú Bakr ibn Duraid the Azdite (A.H. 223-321) had composed
forty rare stories on a variety of subjects expressed in strange
sounding speech and obsolete and incongruous words, such as men's
natures would shrink from and their ears be closed against, which he
said he had produced from the springs of his breast, extracted from the
mines of his thought and exposed to public view and perception,
Hamadhání met him with four hundred Maqámát on mendicity.' <span
id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_88.md) These are instinct with interest and
beauty and between no two of them is there the slightest resemblance,
either as regards words or ideas. He attributes the composition and
narration of them to two persons. <span id="fr_89"></span>[3](#fn_89.md)
One of them he called ‘Ísá ibn Hishám and the other he named Abú’l-Fatḥ
al-Iskanderí. These two he made to exchange pearls of thought and to
give expression to bewitching language such as would cause the sorrowful
to laugh and the staid to become excited. 'In these compositions he,
acquaints us with every kind of pleasantry and informs us of every
species of subtlety. Generally, one of the characters is made the author
of the story and the other the narrator of it.' <span
id="fr_90"></span>[4](#fn_90.md)

Ibn Khallikan makes no mention of these stories in the list of works
ascribed to Ibn Duraid <span id="fr_91"></span>[5](#fn_91.md) nor is there
any reference to them in that cited by Yaqút. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[6](#fn_92.md) The nearest approach to a work of this
kind by that author is the *Kitáb al-Lughát* on the dialects or
idiomatic expressions of the Arabs. <span id="fr_93"></span>[7](#fn_93.md)

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

If, therefore, the stories were what they were represented to be by
al-Ḥuṣrí they were probably written in a dialect which had become
obsolescent.

It is interesting to observe that Hamadhání's compositions had reached
and were known in Qairawán, the sacred city of Islám in Tunisia, at this
early date, and that we have from the pen of another contemporary a
criticism, which probably expressed the opinion of the learned world as
to the literary merits of the Maqámát.

The triple aim of Hamadhání appears to have been to amuse, to interest
and to instruct; and this explains why, in spite of the inherent
difficulty of a work of this kind composed primarily with a view to
rhetorical effect upon the learned and the great, there is scarcely a
dull chapter in the fifty-one maqámát. There is little evidence that the
story or the adventure is subordinated to the style.

When the author essayed, in the course of these dramatic discourses, to
illustrate the life and language both of the denizens of the desert and
of the dwellers in towns, to give examples of the jargon and slang of
thieves and robbers as well as of the lucubrations of the learned and
the conversations of the cultured, and to show the use of strange and
obsolete words and phrases, such as are found in the proverbs--probably
the oldest forms of the Arabic language and the earliest utterances of
the Arabian people--difficult and obscure passages were inevitable. On
page 10 of the text the author asserts that one of his objects was to
capture these rare words and strange sayings. In fact the collection of
nawádir, or recondite expressions, was a favourite pursuit. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94.md)

In electing to do this in rhymed prose he imposed upon himself all the
limitations of a style which, in any but the hand of a master, tends to
become oppressively monotonous and depressingly dull. <span
id="fr_95"></span>[2](#fn_95.md)

In pleasing contrast, however, to the numerous obscurities, intentional
and otherwise, the hypocritical and dishonest Qádí, the Bedawín robber,
the simple rustic, the eloquent and fearless

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

preacher, the garrulous trader, the miserly merchant, and the loquacious
barber with his amazing malapropisms containing cleverly concealed
allusions, are portrayed with all the graphic skill of a master of the
art of description.

The commentator in referring to the author's descriptive power says: 'He
combines the accuracy of the idiom of the dwellers of the desert with
the refinement and taste of the people of the towns, so that the reader
imagines himself to be now among the hair tents of a Bedawín encampment
and anon amidst the stately buildings of a city.' <span
id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md)

The second point of importance in this extract from the *Zahr al-Adáb*
is the reference to the number of the compositions. Al-Huṣrí must have
had the Maqámát and the Letters before him, because he gives copious
extracts from both in the work above mentioned, and if there had not
been four hundred he would, in all probability, have alluded to the fact
when mentioning their number. We have, therefore, in the printed text
about one-eighth of the original work.

The question, as to whether the maqámát are impromptu compositions, as
they were represented to be, may be disposed of by a consideration of
the maqámát themselves. They bear evident trace of scholarly preparation
and literary finish, and I think the author himself, unconsciously,
furnishes the explanation. In the fortieth maqáma he says: 'I wrote
elegantly by virtue of much reading. I passed on from reading to
investigation and from investigation to composition.' <span
id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97.md)

Again, on page 389 of the Letters, in replying to certain strictures
passed on the maqámát and to the taunt by his great rival, Abú Bakr
al-Khwárazmí, that he was unable to produce any more, he writes: 'Now if
that savant were just he would have endeavoured to produce five maqámát,
or ten original compositions, and submitted them to the judgement of the
cultured and then, if they approved and did not reject them, he might
have adversely criticized us. Now let him understand that, while I have
dictated four hundred maqámát on mendicity, between no two of which is
there any resemblance, either as regards words or ideas, he is unable to
produce a tenth of a maqáma, and, therefore, he deserves to have his
faults exposed.'

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

It seems reasonable to suppose that his *modus operandi* was the plan
which he suggested that al-Khwárazmí should have adopted, namely, to
first submit a few maqámát to the learned for their opinion.

The author's boast that 'between no two maqámát is there any similarity,
either as regards words or ideas,' is not consistent with fact, and if
the entire work had been known to al-Khwárazmí in A. H. 383, it is very
doubtful if such a statement would have been made. Al-Ḥuṣrí reproduces
the assertion without comment.

There are several cases of resemblance and not a few of repetition, both
in regard to words and ideas.

For example, the line on page 13, 'In the evening they are Arabs, in the
morning Nabateans ', reappears, with a very slight variation, on page 88
of the text. The themes of the twenty-fifth and the thirty-fourth
maqámát are identical. The fourth and the thirty-seventh have much in
common.

The fifteenth and the fortieth have similar concluding verses. The
forty-fourth is a variation and largely a reproduction of the
twenty-eighth. Other instances of resemblance are recorded in the notes.

Each maqáma is complete in itself and generally consists of a *mélange*
of prose and verse. <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98.md) It usually
concludes with some clever verses in which the improvisor administers a
sharp rebuke, or explains, or justifies his conduct to the narrator.

The maqámát vary in length. Some of them extending over several
pages <span id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_99.md) while others are limited to a
few lines. <span id="fr_100"></span>[3](#fn_100.md) In some both persons of
the drama are not introduced, and the narrator, who is, of course, the
author himself, speaks in his own character. <span
id="fr_101"></span>[4](#fn_101.md) In others one is left to conjecture as
to the identity of the improvisor. <span id="fr_102"></span>[5](#fn_102.md)

As regards the style of the work, its distinctive feature is
parallelism, which consists in making the second part of a

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

sentence balance with the first, either by way of antithesis, or by
expressing the same idea in different words, thus producing, as it were,
a rhyme of the sense as well as of the sound. <span
id="fr_103"></span>[1](#fn_103.md)

The Maqámát did much to fix a style of composition in which Persian and
Greek ideas could make little inroads. Still there is more of the
foreign element than the purist would approve. More than sixty such
words have been collected and traced, as far as possible, to original
sources.

The copious notes and numerous references essential to the elucidation
of the text afford in themselves abundant evidence of the difficult
nature and comprehensive character of the Maqámát. The sources the
author has drawn upon for his materials are, as might be expected,
exclusively Muslim. They consist of the comparison of the poets, an
important branch of b*elles-lettres* (…), the relative merits of Jarír
and Farazdaq, a question the Arabs never seemed able to decide;
incidents from the lives of Dhúr’l-Rumma and Farazdaq; tests of
acquaintance with the principal poets and their poetry; <span
id="fr_104"></span>[2](#fn_104.md) polemical questions such as the
Mu‘tazilite heresy, the doctrine of free will and the dogmas of
predestination and the uncreate Qur’án.

There are examples of the proverbial generosity of the Ḥamdánid prince
Saif al-Daula and the Arab's knowledge of the points of the horse,
popular superstitions such as the belief in charms, pulpit oratory, the
dangers of the desert, apt quotations from the Qur’án, popular sayings
and customs illustrative of Bedawín life, insolence of the servants of
the great, flattering and faithless friends and their treatment, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[3](#fn_105.md) eulogy of the patron, satirizing of the
Qáḍí and the convivial assembly. Others might be mentioned, but these
are sufficient to show the subjects Hamadhání laid under contribution,
and the versatile character of the Maqámát.

The question as to whether Hamadhání owed anything, directly or
indirectly, to Greek scholarship or Byzantine models is an extremely
difficult one upon which to venture an opinion.

In the matter of the lavish display of erudition, intentional
obscurities, and the use of words of doubtful meaning, the

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Maqámát may be
compared with the Cassandra, or Alexandra of Lycophron (285-247 B.C.).

It is highly improbable, however, that the author derived any
inspiration from this product of antiquity. But the similarity suggests
that the same demons of difficulty, obscurity, and pedantry, entered the
orators and poets of both nations at different periods.

For instance, Hamadhání boasts of his ability to employ no less than
four hundred artifices in writing and composition, <span
id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106.md) such as the writing of a letter which,
if read backwards, furnishes the required reply, or an epistle
containing no dotted letters, or without using the letters (ﺍ) or (ﻝ),
or a letter which if read one way constitutes a eulogy, and, if taken in
another, is a satire; feats which, when they were proposed to Abú Bakr
al-Khwárazmí as literary tests, he denounced as the tricks of a
juggler. <span id="fr_107"></span>[2](#fn_107.md)

He shows little disposition, however, to make use of such artifices in
the Maqámát, but the suggestion was not lost upon Ḥarírí, who frequently
employed them for the display of his superior skill and learning. <span
id="fr_108"></span>[3](#fn_108.md)

In point of literary style and in regard to the manner of describing in
an amusing way the occurrences of everyday life there is a closer
resemblance between the Maqámát and the Satires of Horace (65-8 B.C.).
Here again the resemblance is accidental rather than essential.

There is, however, a far closer resemblance between the Maqámát and the
Greek Mimes. The similarity is indeed so striking that one is almost
forced into the belief, either that they must have had a common origin
or that the same informing spirit speaks to the nations irrespective of
race, time, or place.

So far as we know the Mime commences seriously with Sophron (about 430
B.C.), whose Mimes, unlike those of Herondas, which we have, were in
prose. 'These dialogues contained both male and female characters. Some
were serious and some were humorous in style. They portrayed the daily
life of the Sicilian Greeks, and were written in pithy, popular language
full of proverbs and colloquialisms.' <span
id="fr_109"></span>[4](#fn_109.md)

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

Almost every word of this description of the Mimes might, *mutatis
mutandis*, be applied to the Maqámát. According to Reich the Mime
influenced the thought of early ecclesiastical writers, and was a
subject of considerable concern and controversy with the Christian
Fathers. <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](mhm08.htm#fn_110.md) It found its way
to India and flourished in Syria, Palestine, Alexandria, Antioch and
Constantinople. <span id="fr_111"></span>[2](mhm08.htm#fn_111.md) It would
be strange indeed if the Arabs alone remained ignorant of its existence.
That the term Mime was known to them appears from the word … and it is
conceivable that the practice of composing humorous or entertaining
dialogues passed from Greek to Syriac and from Syrian to Arabic.

Once having received the impulse or inspiration the Arabs would, in
accordance with their national genius, develop the idea on their own
lines, as they did in the case of law and grammar. This is, of course,
mere conjecture, but the outstanding fact of the striking resemblance
remains a problem upon which investigation and research may some day
shed new light.

Finally, the practice of making one person the hero of a series of
adventures has been tried by some modern writers. In Grant Allen's *An
African Millionaire* Colonel Clay has much in common with Abú’l-Fatḥ
al-Iskanderí, the hero of the Maqamát.
