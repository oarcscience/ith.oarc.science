### XVII. THE MAQAMA OF BUKHARA <span id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_450.md)

SAID ‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM: One day, joined to a small company of friends
bound together in friendship, like the Pleiades, <span
id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_451.md) I alighted <span
id="fr_452"></span>[3](#fn_452.md) in the cathedral mosque of Bukhára. Now,
when the mosque was filled with its congregation, there appeared before
us one clad in a pair of worn-out garments. <span
id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_453.md) He had slung his empty wallet over his
shoulder, and was bringing behind him a naked boy whose endurance was
straitened by calamity, while the cold anon gripped him and let 'him
go. <span id="fr_454"></span>[5](#fn_454.md) He possessed no covering but
his own skin and had nought that sufficed to protect him from a single
shivering. The man stood and said: 'None will regard this child except
him to whom God has been gracious, and none will be moved to pity by
this misfortune but him who is not secure from the like. O possessors of
famous fortunes, embroidered robes, lofty houses, and strongly built
castles, ye will not be secure from accident, nor will heirs fail you.
Hasten then to do good, while ye can and be bounteous unto the world as
long as it is bounteous unto you. For, by Heavens! we have eaten
"sikbáj", <span id="fr_455"></span>[6](#fn_455.md) ridden the fleet-footed
camel, donned brocaded silk <span id="fr_456"></span>[7](#fn_456.md) and
slept on stuffed couches in the evenings.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

Then, before we knew it, came fortune's treacherous blast and the
turning of the back of the shield. Then the fleet camel was changed for
the slow short-paced steed, the brocade for wool, and so on until I am
reduced to the state and garb in which ye see me. Behold we seek
sustenance from barren fortune's breast and ride poverty's sombre steed.
We gaze not but with the orphan's eye and stretch forth only the
debtor's hands. Now is there any generous one who will dispel the
blackness <span id="fr_457"></span>[1](#fn_457.md) of this want and blunt
the edge of this misfortune?' Then he sat down leaning upon his elbows,
and he said to the boy: 'Attend to thy business.' The boy said: 'What
can I say when this thy speech, did it but come in contact with hair,
would clip it, or with a rock would cleave it. Verily a heart not
rendered tender by what thou hast said is tough indeed. Ye have heard, O
people, what ye have never heard before to-day. Let each one of you
engage his hand with charity. Let him think of his own future and
shield, through me, his own child. Remember me, <span
id="fr_458"></span>[2](#fn_458.md) and I will remember you and give unto me
and I will thank you.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám, 'In my loneliness I had
nought that solaced me but a ring which I placed upon his little
finger. <span id="fr_459"></span>[3](#fn_459.md) As soon as he got it he
recited praising, the ring upon the finger, saying:--

O the encircled with itself, <span id="fr_460"></span>[4](#fn_460.md)  
With a necklace like unto the Gemini in beauty!  
Like a lover meeting his friend,  
And then lovingly and pathetically embraces him.  
Selecting one not of his own tribe,  
As an ally against fate.  
A precious thing whose worth is exalted,  
Yet, verily, more exalted is he who gave it.  
I swear, if in glory men were words,  
Thou wouldst be their meaning.' <span id="fr_461"></span>[5](#fn_461.md)

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: So we gave him what was easy of attainment at
once, and then he turned away from us praising us.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I followed him,
until privacy revealed his face and lo! it was our Shaikh Abú’l-Fatḥ
al-Iskanderí, and behold the fawn was his child. I said; 'Abú’l-Fatḥ,
thou hast grown old <span id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_462.md) and the boy
grown up; 'What of the word of greeting and of converse?'

He answered:--

'A stranger am I <span id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_463.md) when the road
doth contain us,  
A friend when the tents do enclose us.'

By this I knew he was averse to conversing with me, so I left him and
went away.
