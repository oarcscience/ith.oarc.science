### XLIV. THE MAQAMA OF POETRY

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was in the region of Syria and
there joined me a party of travelling companions. Now one day we were
assembled together in a circle and we began to discuss poetry and to
quote verses difficult in meaning, and to propound enigmas. And there
stood near us a youth who listened, as though he understood, and
remained silent as if he regretted doing so. So I said: 'O young man,
thy standing up annoys us, therefore either sit down or go away.' He
replied: 'It is impossible for me to sit down, but I will go away and
return, so keep your places.' We said: 'We will do that with pleasure.'
Then he withdrew his presence, but he delayed not to return immediately.
And he asked: 'Where are ye with those verses and what have ye done with
the puzzles? Ask me concerning them.' And we asked him not a verse but
he answered, nor a meaning but he correctly explained it. Now, when we
had emptied the quivers, and made an end of the stores, he turned upon
us interrogatively, renewed the discussion

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

and said: 'Tell me what verse is that, half of which elevates and half
repels? And what verse is it the whole of which slaps? And what verse is
that half of which is angry and half jests? And what verse is it the
whole of which is mangy? And what verse is that the last foot of whose
first half fights, and the final foot of whose second half conciliates?
What verse is that whose whole is scorpions? What verse is that which is
unseemly in original intent but can be made proper by punctuation. <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[1](#fn_1005.md) What verse is that whose tears cease
not to flow? <span id="fr_1006"></span>[2](#fn_1006.md) What verse is that
all of which runs away except its foot? What verse is that whose subject
is not known? <span id="fr_1007"></span>[3](#fn_1007.md) What verse is that
which is longer than its fellow, as though it were not of its
kind? <span id="fr_1008"></span>[4](#fn_1008.md)

What verse is that which cannot be dissolved, and whose soil cannot be
dug? What verse is that half of which is perfect and half clothes? What
verse is that whose number cannot be counted? What verse is that which
shows thee what pleases? What verse is that which the world cannot
contain? What verse is that half of which laughs and half feels pain?
What verse is that if its branch be shaken, its beauty departs? What
verse is that if we collect it together, its meaning is gone? What verse
is that if we set it at liberty, we cause it to go astray? What verse is
that whose honey is poison? What verse is that whose praise is censure?
What verse is that whose expression is sweet, but underlying it there is
grief? What verse is that whose dissolving is binding up, and the whole
of it is paid down? What verse is that half of which is prolongation and
half rejection? What verse is that half of which is elevation and its
elevation is a slap? What verse is that whose expulsion is eulogy, but
whose converse is censure? What verse is that which, in a visitation, is
a prayer for the time of peril? <span id="fr_1009"></span>[5](#fn_1009.md)
What verse is that which the sheep eat when they please?

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

What verse is that which when it hits the head, smashes the teeth? What
verse is that which extends till it reaches six pounds? What verse is it
that stood up, then fell down and went to sleep? What verse is it that
wished to decrease, but increased? What verse is it that was about to go
and then returned? What verse destroyed ‘Iráq <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1](#fn_1010.md)? What verse conquered Baṣra? What
verse is it that melted under torture?

What verse grew old before adolescence? What verse is it that returned
before the appointed time? What verse is it that alighted and then
passed away? What verse is it that was tightly twisted and then became
strong? What verse is that, which was adjusted till it became rectified?
What verse is that which is swifter than Ṭirimmaḥ's arrow? <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[2](#fn_1011.md) What verse is it that issued from
their eyes? What verse is it that contracted, and then sufficed to fill
the world? What verse is it that returned and excited pain? What verse
is that half of which is gold and the remainder tail? What verse is that
some of which is darkness and some of which is wine? What verse is that
whose subject is converted into the object, and whose understanding is
made to be understood? What verse is that the whole of which is
inviolate? What two verses are like a string of camels? What verse is it
that descends from above? What verse is that whose prognostication is
ominous? What verse is that whose end flees but whose beginning seeks?
What verse is that whose beginning gives, but whose end plunders?'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'Thus did we hear something which we had never
heard before. So we asked for the explanation, but he denied it to us,
and, therefore, we considered them to be words finely hewn, but with no
ideas underlying them. Then he said: 'Choose five of these problems so
that I may explain them, and do ye exert yourselves a few days in
finding out the rest. It may be that your vessel will sweat, and your
minds be generous. Then, if ye fail, let us have a fresh reunion in
order that I may explain the remainder.'

And among those we selected was the verse which is

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

unseemly in original intent but can be made proper by punctuation. So we
asked him concerning it, and he said: 'It is the verse of Abú Núwás:--

And we passed the night, <span id="fr_1012"></span>[1](#fn_1012.md) God
regarding us as the vilest company, trailing the skirts of wickedness,
and no boast.'

We asked: 'And the verse whose dissolving is binding up and the whole of
it is paid down?' He replied: 'It is the verse of Al ‘Aasha,--

All our dirhems are good, <span id="fr_1013"></span>[2](#fn_1013.md) so
delay us not by testing them.'

And the paraphrase of that would be to say: 'Our dirhems are good, all
of them, so delay us not by testing them.' Now the metre is not
destroyed by this paraphrase. We asked: 'And the verse half of which is
prolongation and half rejection?' He replied: 'It is the verse of
al-Bakrí, <span id="fr_1014"></span>[3](#fn_1014.md)

A genuine dinar came to thee <span id="fr_1015"></span>[4](#fn_1015.md)
short of sixty fals,  
From the most generous of men, except as regards origin, development and
personality.

We asked: 'And the verse that the sheep eat when they please?' He said:
'It is the verse of the poet:

"May separation be cut off! <span id="fr_1016"></span>[5](#fn_1016.md) May
separation be severed!  
I perceive separation <span id="fr_1017"></span>[6](#fn_1017.md) to be a
great severer of friends."  
We asked: 'And the verse which extends till it reaches six pounds?' He
replied: 'It is the verse of Ibn al-Rúmí,  
"When he gives, <span id="fr_1018"></span>[7](#fn_1018.md) he makes not his
gift an obligation and he says to my soul, O soul respite me."'

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: Then we knew that the problems were not destitute
of beauty. <span id="fr_1019"></span>[1](#fn_1019.md) So we tried hard and
we found out some, and obtained information about the others. Then I
recited after him, while he was running quickly away:--

'Men differ in excellence <span id="fr_1020"></span>[2](#fn_1020.md) and
some resemble others,  
But for him I should have been like Raḍwá <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[3](#fn_1021.md) in length, depth and breadth.'

Ṭirimmáḥ ibn Ḥakím ibn al-Ḥakam, the name of a famous poet, a
contemporary of Dhú al-Rumma (ob. 117 A.H.) I have not been able to find
anything to connect the poet with archery.

Metre *tawíl*. … When he gives--The play is on … which means, 'he
bestowed ', and a certain weight which is generally considered as equal
to two pounds troy weight. The repetition of this word four times works
out exactly six ratls or pounds.

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[171:1](mhm52.htm#fr_1019.md) … *Not destitute of

<span id="fn_1021"></span>[171:3](mhm52.htm#fr_1021.md) … *Like Raḍwá:*
There are several mountains of this name in Arabia. The one alluded to
is probably that near Madína which the Arabs quote as synonymous with
something weighty and responsible. Cf. the line by Mú’arrí cited by the
Commentator, Text, p. 226: 'And the weight of Raḍwá is less than that
which I bear'.

SOLUTIONS BY THE COMMENTATOR:

*The verse half of which elevates and half repels:*

'And I have one side of my life for God which I do not waste,

'And I have another side for discussion and depravity.'

*The verse half of which is angry and half jests:* ‘Amr ibn Kúlthúm's
lines:

'As if our swords, ours and theirs, were wooden blades in the hands of
players.'

*The verse whose beginning gives, but whose end plunders*, ‘Amr ibn
Kúlthúm's lines:--

'We entertained you and we hastened your entertainment,  
A little before the morning, with the grinding of the millstone of war.'

*The verse that cannot be dissolved:* 'And verily He who hath raised the
heavens hath built for us a house whose supports are most substantial
and lofty.'

For an illustration of the meaning of … he raised, or elevated, see
Qur’án, lxxix, 28.

*The verse, if we set it at liberty, we cause it to go astray:*

'Am I not in sorrow upon a worn-out camel,  
Conducted by an experimenting guide followed by my heart?'

*The verse that stood, then fell down and went to sleep:*

'O ye sleepers! awake from your sleep!  
I will ask you, does love kill a man?'

*The verse, when its branch is shaken, its beauty departs:*

'Thou hast such a form, that were it not for the hawks of thine eyes,
the grey pigeon would surely sing upon it.'

*The verse whose beginning seeks, but whose end flees:*

'With ignorance like the ignorance of the sword, when it is drawn.  
And clemency like the clemency of the sword, when it is sheathed.'

*The verse that was about to go away and then returned:*

'And I am not one of those happy in enjoyment among them,  
But I am a mine of glittering gold,'

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

*The verse whose praise is blame:*

'And verily my tribe, numerous though they be,  
Are worthless in war, though it be an insignificant affair.' Freytag,
*Ḥamasa*, p. 7.

*The verse that contracted and then filled the world:* 'It is not a hard
thing for God to collect the world in a single individual '

*The verse that was adjusted till it was rectified:*

'Say not one piece of good news, but two--  
The dignity of the host and the feast of Mehraján.

… The feast (day) of Mehraján. The autumnal equinox, the name of a
festival celebrated in Persia in the month of September. For the origin
of this word see Mas‘údí iii, 404. These lines were recited in praise of
al-Ḥasan ibn Zaid the ruler of Ṭabarístán, died A.H. 270. (Ibn al-Athir,
vii, 286.) The text is wrongly vocalized, for … *Whiteness or blaze;*
*read* … dignity or puissance.

This maqáma is identical in theme with and largely a reproduction of No.
xxviii.

Cf. *Ḥarírí*, ii, 453-70.
