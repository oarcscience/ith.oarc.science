### XXXV. THE MAQAMA OF IBLIS

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I lost some camels of mine and I
went forth in search of them. I alighted in a verdant valley and behold
there were running brooks, <span id="fr_836"></span>[3](#fn_836) tall
trees, ripe fruits, blossoming flowers and broad plains, and lo! an old
man was seated there. Now that which terrifies a solitary person from
his like made me afraid of him, but he said: 'Have no fear.' Then I
saluted him and he ordered me to sit down, and I obeyed. Then he asked
me concerning my condition and I informed him. Then he said to me: 'Thou
hast got thy guide and found thy stray. Dost thou recite anything of the
poems of the Arabs?' I answered: 'Yes,' and I recited from Imr-al-Qais,
‘Obeid, Labíd, and Ṭarafa. But he was not pleased with anything of that
and he asked: 'Shall I repeat some of my poetry?' I said to him:
'Produce it.' Then he recited:

'The co-partners have separated, <span id="fr_837"></span>[4](#fn_837)
but had I obeyed, they would not have parted.  
And they have severed our cords from the bonds of union,'

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

until he went over the whole qaṣída. I said: 'O Shaikh! this is Jarír's
poem, the boys have conned it, the women know it, it has entered the
tents and reached the assemblies.' He said: 'Stop this but if thou dost
know a poem of Abú Núwás repeat it to me.' So I recited to him

'I will not lament over the deserted abode, <span
id="fr_838"></span>[1](#fn_838)  
Nor will I yearn after the drivers of the white camels.  
The dwelling most worthy of abandonment is that one;  
In which union with the beloved is not long enjoyed. <span
id="fr_839"></span>[2](#fn_839)  
What a splendid night was that which is past. How delightful it was!  
When the cups took effect upon our haughty brethren;  
And a young gazelle <span id="fr_840"></span>[3](#fn_840) whose eye
spoke enchantment,  
Girded with a girdle, <span id="fr_841"></span>[4](#fn_841) an ally of
the rosary and sanctification.  
I strove with him for a kiss, and the wine was pure and ruddy,  
In the garb of a Qáḍí and with the piety of Shaikh Iblís. <span
id="fr_842"></span>[5](#fn_842)  
When we became intoxicated, and all the people were drunk,  
And I feared his overthrowing me with the cups,  
I snored, feigning slumber, that I might put him to sleep,

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

And both his eyeballs clad themselves with sleep from my bag.  
Then he stretched himself on a couch which was finer to me,  
In spite of its disordered condition, than the throne of Balqís <span
id="fr_843"></span>[1](#fn_843),  
And I visited his sleeping-place before the dawn,  
And when the sound of the church bells <span
id="fr_844"></span>[2](#fn_844) indicated the morning.  
So he asked, "Who is that?" I answered:  
"The priest has come. <span id="fr_845"></span>[3](#fn_845)  
And thy convent <span id="fr_846"></span>[4](#fn_846) must be
ministered <span id="fr_847"></span>[5](#fn_847) by the priest." <span
id="fr_848"></span>[6](#fn_848)  
He said: "By my life thou art a vile sort of a man."  
But I said: 'Never! I am not one to be blamed."'

He related: 'Then he rejoiced, cried out and shouted.' So I said: 'God
disfigure thee for an old man! I know not whether thou be more stupid in
arrogating to thyself Jarír's poetry, or in thy delight at the poem of
Abú Núwás who is a libertine <span id="fr_849"></span>[7](#fn_849) and a
vagabond.' He said: 'Stop this! Go thy way

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

and when thou dost meet on the road a man with a leathern bottle, who
goes about in the houses, around the cooking-pots, boasts of his form
and glories in his beard, say to him: "Direct me to a bound fish in a
sea, slender in the waist, that stings like a wasp, and turbans with
light." His father is a stone, his mother a male. Gold is his head and
flame is his name, and the rest of him is tail. He acts upon clothes
with ṭhe action of the moth. In the house he is the bane of the oil, a
greedy drinker never satisfied, and a glutton never sated. A bountiful
giver whom none forbids; he climbs the acclivity, and his property does
not decrease through generosity. What pleases him grieves thee, and what
benefits thee injures him. I was going to conceal from thee my story and
live with thee in comfort, but thou didst refuse, now hear the
truth. <span id="fr_850"></span>[1](#fn_850) There is not a poet <span
id="fr_851"></span>[2](#fn_851) but has a helper from among us. And I
dictated this qaṣída to Jarír. I am the Shaikh Abd Múrrah.' <span
id="fr_852"></span>[3](#fn_852) Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'Then he vanished
and I saw him not. And I went on headlong and met a man with a
fly-whisk <span id="fr_853"></span>[4](#fn_853) in his hand. I said to
myself, <span id="fr_854"></span>[5](#fn_854) "By Heavens! this is my
man." So I told him what I had heard of him. Then he handed me a lamp,
pointed to a dark cave in the mountain and said: "There is the cave and
thou hast with thee the lamp."' He related: 'I entered it and behold I
found my camels and they had taken the other direction, but I turned
their heads and drove them back. Now, while I was in that situation in
the wood, creeping stealthily through the thicket, lo! Abú’l-Fatḥ
al-Iskanderí met me with a greeting.' I said to him: 'Sirrah! what has
driven thee to this place?' He answered: 'The injustice of the days in
decisions, and the non-existence of generous men.' I said: 'O
Abú’l-Fatḥ, give then thy command.' He said: 'Bear me

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

on a young she-camel, and supply me with some provisions.' <span
id="fr_855"></span>[1](#fn_855) I said: 'That is thine.' Then he recited
and said:--

'My soul a ransom <span id="fr_856"></span>[2](#fn_856) for the man who
gave me the choice.  
I tasked him extremely, but he was generous.  
He scratched not his beard, he wiped not his nose and he did not cough.'

Then I told him the story of the old man, whereupon he pointed to his
turban and said: 'This is the fruit of his benevolence.' I exclaimed: 'O
Abú’l-Fatḥ, hast thou begged from the devil? Thou art indeed a mighty
mendicant.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_836"></span>[138:3](mhm43.htm#fr_836) … *Brooks:*
Literally, little streams, from … he made it little.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[138:4](mhm43.htm#fr_837) The co-partners have
separated: Metre, *basít*. See Ibn Qutaiba's Sh‘ir wá Shu‘ará, p. 9.

… *Co-partners:* plural of … and … literally, a cord of twisted bark
with which camels are tied.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[139:1](mhm43.htm#fr_838) *I will not lament
over the deserted abode:* Metre, *basit*. Abú Nuwás was one of the first
to condemn the time-honoured prelude in the form of the erotic prologue
to the qasída. Allusion has already been made in the note on Dhú
al-Rumma, p. 49, to al-Farazdaq's condemnation of it.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[139:2](mhm43.htm#fr_839) … *Is not long
enjoyed:* Literally, is not enduring, from he lived with.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[139:3](mhm43.htm#fr_840) … *A young gazelle:*
That has become strong and has no need of its mother from … he became
strong,

<span id="fn_841"></span>[139:4](mhm43.htm#fr_841) … *Girded with a
girdle, an ally of the rosary and sanctification*. In this line the poet
seems to refer to Christianity (the girdle), Islám (the rosary), Judaism
(…) which refers to that part of the Jewish Liturgy where God's name is
sanctified. Cf. Waráqah's exclamation to Khadíja … 'Holy! Holy!' *Life
of Muḥammad* (Wüstenfeld), p. 153.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[139:5](mhm43.htm#fr_842) *The piety of Shaikh
Iblís:* An allusion to the piety of Iblís *per contrarium*. For the use
of 'Shaikh' as a title for Iblís, see *Ḥarírí*, p. 144.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[140:1](mhm43.htm#fr_843) … *The throne of
Balqís:* (Queen of Sheba) See Qur’án, xxvii, 23. Baiḍáwí says this
throne was made of gold and silver and crowned with precious stones. Its
surface was eighty cubits square and its-height eighty cubits. Baiḍáwí‘,
*Commentary* (edited by Fleischer), ii, 66.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[140:2](mhm43.htm#fr_844) … *The bells:* Plural
of … arabicized from the Syriac *naqusha*, an oblong piece of thick wood
with several holes bored through it struck with a mallet called …
*rabil*, used by Christians in Muslim countries instead of church bells
to summon people to prayer. Hence, in the present day, applied to a
bell, and particularly to the bell of a church or convent.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[140:3](mhm43.htm#fr_845) … *The priest:*
Arabicized from the Syriac qashá a presbyter.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[140:4](mhm43.htm#fr_846) … Probably … plural …
a convent, monastery or cloister. From the Syriac *dairá*, Chaldaic.
‏דיר‎

<span id="fn_847"></span>[140:5](mhm43.htm#fr_847) … *Ministered:* The
context shows that the poet has evidently used the Hebrew ‏תַשׁמִישׁ‎
from ‏שָׁמַשׁ‎ to minister, the double entendre of which suits the line.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[140:6](mhm43.htm#fr_848) … *A priest:* From
the Syriac qashíshá, from gash, to be old.

These verses are a sample of the thinly veiled obscene allusions in
which Abú Nuwás revelled. They are not found in the published Diwán of
this poet.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[140:7](mhm43.htm#fr_849) … *A libertine:* The
diminutive is used for aggrandizement.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[141:1](mhm43.htm#fr_850) *Now hear the truth:*
Literally, now take it.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[141:2](mhm43.htm#fr_851) *There is not a
poet:* An allusion to the popular belief that every poet was inspired by
a Jinn or Satan. Cf. the twenty-seventh Maqáma, p. 137, line 5. For a
similar story, see Letters of Abú ‘Alá al-Mu‘arrí, translated by
Professor Margoliouth, p. 74 and Yaqút, vi, 122.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[141:3](mhm43.htm#fr_852) *Abú Múrrah:*
Literally, the father of calamity. The most famous of the nicknames of
Iblís. Said also to have been the nickname of Pharaoh. Ibn al-Athír,
*Kunya Lexicon*, edited by Seybold, p. 197.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[141:4](mhm43.htm#fr_853) *A fly-whisk*:
Literally a small leathern bottle.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[141:5](mhm43.htm#fr_854) … Literally, so I
said.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[142:1](mhm43.htm#fr_855) *Supply me with some
provisions:* Literally, pour some water into the wood.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[142:2](mhm43.htm#fr_856) *My soul a ransom:*
Metre, *kámil*.
