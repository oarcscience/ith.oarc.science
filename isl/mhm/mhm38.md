The Maqámát of Badí‘ al-Zamán al-Hamadhání, tr. W.J. Prendergast
\[1915\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XXX. THE MAQAMA OF RUSAFA

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I sallied forth from
Ruṣáfa <span id="fr_725"></span>[5](#fn_725.md) to go to the capital when
the fervent summer sultriness <span id="fr_726"></span>[6](#fn_726.md)
boiled in the breast of irritation. Now when I had traversed half the
road, the heat became intense, patience failed me and so I turned
towards a masjid which had appropriated to itself the secret of all
beauty. <span id="fr_727"></span>[7](#fn_727.md) And in it there were
people

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

contemplating its ceilings and discussing its pillars. Finally the
discussion led them <span id="fr_728"></span>[1](#fn_728.md) to the
mentioning of thieves and their artifices, and cut-purses and their
practices.

They mentioned among thieves, forgers of seals, the light-fingered, and
palmers, him who gives short weight, him who robs in the ranks, him who
throttles by the sudden attack, <span id="fr_729"></span>[2](#fn_729.md)
him who hides in the locker till lifting is possible, him who
substitutes by cajoling, <span id="fr_730"></span>[3](#fn_730.md) him who
steals in jest, him who steals by the confidence trick, him who invites
to compromise, <span id="fr_731"></span>[4](#fn_731.md) him who sweeps off
the change, <span id="fr_732"></span>[5](#fn_732.md) him who induces

id="fr_735"></span>[8](#fn_735.md) and a needle and thread, him who brings
thee a lock, <span id="fr_736"></span>[9](#fn_736.md) him who

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

makes a subterranean passage, him who renders men unconscious with
hemp, <span id="fr_737"></span>[1](#fn_737.md) or cheats by juggling, <span
id="fr_738"></span>[2](#fn_738.md) him who changes his shoes, <span
id="fr_739"></span>[3](#fn_739.md) him who ties his two ropes, <span
id="fr_740"></span>[4](#fn_740.md) him who overpowers with the sword, him
who ascends from the well, <span id="fr_741"></span>[5](#fn_741.md) him who
accompanies the caravan, <span id="fr_742"></span>[6](#fn_742.md) the
gentry of the cloth, <span id="fr_743"></span>[7](#fn_743.md) him who
enters the assemblies, <span id="fr_744"></span>[8](#fn_744.md) him who
flees from the night patrol, <span id="fr_745"></span>[9](#fn_745.md) him
who seeks refuge from danger, him who flies the bird, <span
id="fr_746"></span>[10](#fn_746.md) him who plays with the strap <span
id="fr_747"></span>[11](#fn_747.md) and says 'Sit down, there is no harm!'
him who steals by playing upon people's modesty, him who

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

takes advantage of a panic, him who gets a meal <span
id="fr_748"></span>[1](#fn_748.md) in the street by blowing his trumpet,
him who brings a pitcher, <span id="fr_749"></span>[2](#fn_749.md) the
master gardeners, <span id="fr_750"></span>[3](#fn_750.md) those who rob
through the windows, <span id="fr_751"></span>[4](#fn_751.md) him who
scales lofty houses, him who climbs <span
id="fr_752"></span>[5](#fn_752.md) upon the roof, him who creeps stealthily
with the knife along the mud wall, him who comes to thee suddenly with a
sweet-smelling nosegay, <span id="fr_753"></span>[6](#fn_753.md) the men of
the axe <span id="fr_754"></span>[7](#fn_754.md) like official attendants,
him who comes by stealth and moans after the manner of madmen, the
possessors of keys, <span id="fr_755"></span>[8](#fn_755.md) the men of
cotton and wind, <span id="fr_756"></span>[9](#fn_756.md) him who. enters
the door in the guise of a guest, him who goes into the house like a
visitor, him who passes in humbly in the garb of the destitute, him who
steals at the cistern when the plunge makes it

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

possible, <span id="fr_757"></span>[1](#fn_757.md) him who robs with two
sticks, <span id="fr_758"></span>[2](#fn_758.md) him who swears to a
debt, <span id="fr_759"></span>[3](#fn_759.md) him who cheats with the
pledge, <span id="fr_760"></span>[4](#fn_760.md) him who gives a bill of
exchange, <span id="fr_761"></span>[5](#fn_761.md) him who changes the
purse, <span id="fr_762"></span>[6](#fn_762.md) him who palms off in fraud,
him who gives to bankrupts, <span id="fr_763"></span>[7](#fn_763.md) him
who clips his sleeve <span id="fr_764"></span>[8](#fn_764.md) and then
says, 'Observe and decide', him who stitches the breast, <span
id="fr_765"></span>[9](#fn_765.md) him who says 'Dost thou not know? <span
id="fr_766"></span>[10](#fn_766.md) him who

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

bites, <span id="fr_767"></span>[1](#fn_767.md) and him who ties, <span
id="fr_768"></span>[2](#fn_768.md) him who substitutes when he counts, him
who enters with his accomplices and says, 'He is not asleep', <span
id="fr_769"></span>[3](#fn_769.md) him who deceives thee with a
thousand, <span id="fr_770"></span>[4](#fn_770.md) him who passes
behind, <span id="fr_771"></span>[5](#fn_771.md) him who steals in
fetters, <span id="fr_772"></span>[6](#fn_772.md) him who shams pain to
defraud, him who beats with the shoe, <span
id="fr_773"></span>[7](#fn_773.md) him who questions the truth, <span
id="fr_774"></span>[8](#fn_774.md) him who steals with a cleft stick, him
who enters by the underground passage, him who takes advantage of
mining,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

the masters of the grapnels and the rope of coconut fibre; and the
conversation turned on to him who got the better of them. <span
id="fr_775"></span>[1](#fn_775.md)

Here follows a story of Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí, which, on grounds of
decency, has been omitted. The only thing in it that may be mentioned is
'the moonlight night', regarding which he says, 'in other than his own
garb'.

'And a phantom <span id="fr_776"></span>[2](#fn_776.md) paid a nocturnal
visit when night was in a garb not his own <span
id="fr_777"></span>[3](#fn_777.md)  
And the full moon met him and brightened the parting of his hair.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_725"></span>[122:5](mhm38.htm#fr_725.md) *Ruṣáfa:* A famous
quarter to the east of Baghdad. In the time of al-Manṣúr (A.D. 754-75)
it was the cantonment of the city. It was built by the Khalífa's son
al-Mahdí, in A.H. 159, and in time grew to the size of the capital
itself. It was also the necropolis of the ‘Abbásid Khalífas. (Yaqút, ii,
783. See also Le Strange, *Baghdad*.)

<span id="fn_726"></span>[122:6](mhm38.htm#fr_726.md) … *Fervent summer
sultriness:* Another reading … The live coals of the intense summer
heat.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[122:7](mhm38.htm#fr_727.md) *Which had
appropriated to itself the secret of all beauty:* The cathedral masjid
of Ruṣáfa was larger and more magnificent than that of Baghdad itself.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[123:1](mhm38.htm#fr_728.md) *Finally the
discussion led them:* … 'the end of the discussion led them' … means the
hinder part of anything, particularly the buttock or rump. In poetry it
signifies the second half of a verse or couplet, the first half being
called ṣadr (…)

<span id="fn_729"></span>[123:2](mhm38.htm#fr_729.md) *Him who throttles by
the sudden attack:* From … he went lightly or stealthily, and … he
despatched him. (Lane's Lexicon, article p. 887.)

<span id="fn_730"></span>[123:3](mhm38.htm#fr_730.md) *Him who substitutes
by cajoling:* For this use of the word … than that adopted by the
commentator, see Letters of the author, p 329, line 8.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[123:4](mhm38.htm#fr_731.md) *Him who invites to
compromise:* In a case where he has no legal claim.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[123:5](mhm38.htm#fr_732.md) *Who sweeps off the
change:* The explanation of this trick is as follows: the thief goes to
a money changer on the pretext of changing a dinar then snatches what
the man has before him and decamps.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[123:6](mhm38.htm#fr_733.md) *Him who induces
sleep:* The thief being in company with some one who has money pretends
to be drowsy and thus induces his victim to go to sleep, he then robs
him of his property. But, literally, 'him who puts to sleep with the
eye.' More probably, therefore, hypnotic suggestion.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[123:7](mhm38.htm#fr_734.md) *Him who confounds
with backgammon:* The thief takes with him into the house he intends to
rob a backgammon or chess-board, usually made of cloth, and spreads it
out. In case he is discovered by the master of the house he raises a cry
that he has been cheated at the game and his opponent refuses to pay his
losses.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[123:8](mhm38.htm#fr_735.md) *By means of the
mantle:* The thief observes a man wearing a mantle, goes quickly behind
him, raises the skirt of the garment, in order to get at the purse
usually carried underneath, and begins sewing it to the collar. If he is
discovered, and the man turns round, he says, 'Do not be afraid, I was
only mending thy cloak; dost thou not want it done?' In this way he
manages to escape with or without the purse.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[123:9](mhm38.htm#fr_736.md) *Him who brings thee
a lock:* The thief contrives to sell the shopkeeper a defective lock. If
the latter uses it to lock up his shop, the thief takes advantage of the
first opportunity to effect an entrance and to help himself to the
merchant's goods.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[124:1](mhm38.htm#fr_737) *Hemp* (….md):
Arabicized from the Persian … (Sanskrit *bhangā*), Baron Hammer
Purgstall is wrong in identifying it with the Coptic *bendj*, plural
*nebendj*, which he says is the same plant as the νηπενθης which so much
perplexed the commentators of Homer ([Odyssey](errata.htm#8.md), 4. 221
sq.), for two reasons:

\(a\) There is no such word as *bendj* or *nebendj* in Coptic.

\(b\) It is a good Sanskrit word and is found in the Athara-Veda Samhita
(xi. 6. 15). Also see Monier Williams' Sanskrit and English Dictionary,
article Bhangā.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[124:2](mhm38.htm#fr_738.md) … *By juggling:*
Arabicized from the Persian … literally anything new; also magic and
enchantment.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[124:3](mhm38.htm#fr_739.md) *Him who changes his
shoes:* A very easy thing to do at the masjid or the bath where shoes
and sandals have to be left outside.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[124:4](mhm38.htm#fr_740.md) *Him who ties his two
ropes:* the modus operandi is this: The thief climbs upon the terrace or
roof of a house, ties to the end of a rope what he wishes to steal,
descends quickly and pulls his booty down.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[124:5](mhm38.htm#fr_741.md) *Him who ascends from
the well:* Which he has been using as a place of concealment.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[124:6](mhm38.htm#fr_742.md) *Him who accompanies
the caravan:* As if he were one of the travellers.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[124:7](mhm38.htm#fr_743.md) *The gentry of the
cloth:* That is, the wearers of the ascetic garb. This is still a very
popular form of disguise in the East.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[124:8](mhm38.htm#fr_744.md) *Him who enters the
assemblies:* By virtue of being well-dressed and of respectable
appearance. This is the fourth time the author uses the word *Maqáma*.
Here it means companies of respectable people.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[124:9](mhm38.htm#fr_745.md) *From the night
patrol:* The thief enters a house to rob it. If he is surprised, he
declares he has run away from the night patrol and is the victim of an
injustice. If he is believed he waits for an opportunity to help himself
and then disappears.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[124:10](mhm38.htm#fr_746.md) *Him who flies the
bird:* The thief causes his pigeon to fly into a house and then follows
it. If he is discovered he pretends he has come for his bird. This is
like the excuse of the poacher who, when found trespassing, asserts he
is looking for his sheep!

<span id="fn_747"></span>[124:11](mhm38.htm#fr_747.md) *Him who plays with
the strap:* The explanation of this trick is as follows: The thief
starts a game which consists of one hiding something and asking another
to say where it is. If he fails he is beaten on his hand or leg with a
strap. Such a game is bound to end in a quarrel which the sharper takes
advantage of to appropriate whatever he can.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[125:1](mhm38.htm#fr_748.md) *Him who gets a
meal:* Literally, to blow the trumpet, which means to indulge in vain
and empty talk. (See Taj al-‘Arús, vi, 301.) In order to obtain this
rendering, requiring the reflexive use of the verb, a slight emendation
of the text is necessary, for … read … (p. 161, line 1).

<span id="fn_749"></span>[125:2](mhm38.htm#fr_749.md) *Him who brings a
pitcher:* As though he had come to fetch water. If he can lay his hands
on anything, he steals it. … *Bastúq:* Arabicized from the Persian … or
… a small glazed earthenware vessel.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[125:3](mhm38.htm#fr_750.md) *The master
gardeners:* The thief represents himself to be an expert gardener. If
you employ him he soon begins to help himself to the produce of the
garden and this he does without arousing suspicion, because he is
thought to have your authority to do so … Gardens: Arabicized from the
well-known Persian word … *Bústán*.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[125:4](mhm38.htm#fr_751.md) *Those who rob
through the windows:* … plural of … arabicized from the Persian … a
hole.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[125:5](mhm38.htm#fr_752.md) *Him who climbs:* By
means of a rope.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[125:6](mhm38.htm#fr_753.md) *Him who comes with a
sweet-smelling nosegay:* As if he were bringing it as a present to the
master. Should he get an opportunity he steals something. The practice
of presenting flowers in this way is still common in the East.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[125:7](mhm38.htm#fr_754.md) *The men of the axe:*
That is, the policemen. … and … arabicized from the Persian … an axe and
… imperative form of … to strike; literally something struck with an
axe, or the striker with an axe or a hatchet and then the tool itself.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[125:8](mhm38.htm#fr_755.md) *The possessors of
keys:* Those who carry about a number of keys with which they endeavour
to open doors, boxes, etc.--pickers of locks.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[125:9](mhm38.htm#fr_756.md) *The men of cotton
and wind:* The plan is as follows: the thief scatters some cotton so
that the wind may blow it into certain houses and then, on the pretext
of collecting his cotton, he goes in and robs them. The word … is
probably of foreign origin.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[126:1](mhm38.htm#fr_757.md) *When the plunge or
dip makes it possible:* I think … 'to go deep' would make better sense
than … 'to make possible', i.e. when the bathers plunge into the water.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[126:2](mhm38.htm#fr_758.md) *Him who robs with
two sticks:* The thief stands upon the roof of his house and lies in
wait for the caravan. When it comes opposite the house, he lowers a long
stick on the end of which is a hook like a grapnel and pulls up what he
can of cloth, etc.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[126:3](mhm38.htm#fr_759.md) *Him who swears to a
debt:* This is a species of black-mailing. The swindler swears that a
certain person of importance owes him money. The latter rather than run
the risk of being haled before the Qáḍí pays the amount.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[126:4](mhm38.htm#fr_760.md) *Him who cheats with
the pledge:* The rogue buys goods from a merchant and leaves in pledge
with him a sealed casket supposed to contain valuable jewels which, of
course, it does not.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[126:5](mhm38.htm#fr_761.md) *Him who gives a bill
of exchange:* The fraud is perpetrated as follows: The thief sees a
traveller with a large sum of money in cash and offers to relieve him of
the trouble of carrying it by giving him a bill of exchange on some one
in the town to which he is journeying. The bill is, of course,
worthless. (…) Arabicized from the Persian … literally, pierced; a
consignment made by a person of one country to a person of another.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[126:6](mhm38.htm#fr_762.md) *Him who changes the
purse:* The swindler bargains for some goods, produces a purse and
counts out in gold or silver a sum which the shopkeeper declines to
take, he then puts the purse back into his pocket. The haggling
continues, and eventually he persuades the shopkeeper to accept the
amount first counted. He then pulls out a purse exactly like the first,
but which contains only coppers. If the merchant accepts the purse
without counting the contents, the thief makes off with the goods.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[126:7](mhm38.htm#fr_763.md) *Him who gives to
bankrupts:* The swindler contrives to secure the confidence of some
merchants, takes a quantity of goods and sells them on credit to
impecunious traders, at double the prime cost, and leads the public to
believe he is doing a flourishing business. Then, when he has sold them
articles of the value equal to what he owes his creditors, he announces
he has gone bankrupt and that his outstandings represent exactly the
amount of his liabilities. In this way he benefits by precisely half the
amount of goods he has taken from his creditors.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[126:8](mhm38.htm#fr_764.md) *Him who clips his
sleeve:* When the sharper sees a man placing some money before a
shopkeeper, or a money changer, he seizes him and accuses him of having
robbed him and exhibits his cut sleeve as evidence.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[126:9](mhm38.htm#fr_765.md) *Him who stitches the
breast:* This is similar to the mantle trick.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[126:10](mhm38.htm#fr_766.md) *Him who says 'Dost
thou not know?'* The swindler goes up to his dupe and says, 'Art thou
not aware of what happened to so and so to-day? A thief seized his
clothes thus'--suiting the action to the word--pulls him and, in the
pulling, contrives to rob him of his money.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[127:1](mhm38.htm#fr_767.md) *Him who bites:* The
sharper picks a quarrel with some one and, when they come to blows and
seize each other he contrives, in the struggle, to tear with his teeth
his antagonist's clothes where he thinks the money is put away.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[127:2](mhm38.htm#fr_768.md) *Him who ties:* The
thief being seated near some one he wishes to rob, attaches to a piece
of string, which he retains hold of, whatever he finds it possible to
relieve the individual of. When the man gets up and goes away, the
article is left behind.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[127:3](mhm38.htm#fr_769.md) *'He is not asleep':*
The robber and his accomplices find a man asleep and make a noise until
they wake him by saying, 'He is asleep' or 'He is not asleep', and in
their conversation they lead him to believe that they have buried a
treasure there, and so now he pretends to be asleep. Then to prove
whether or no he is asleep they begin to feel him and, during the
process, rob him. After they have gone he gets up only to find that he
has been both robbed and hoaxed and the buried treasure consists of
worthless shells.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[127:4](mhm38.htm#fr_770.md) *Him who deceives
thee with a thousand:* The sharper deposits for safe custody with a
merchant a bag supposed to contain a thousand dinars. On the top he has
put a layer or two of dinars while the remainder consists of coppers. He
returns later and takes out a few pieces. This is repeated until the
silver is exhausted. Then he buys largely from the merchant who
unhesitatingly gives him credit in the belief that he has a large sum in
deposit. He then bolts. After some time has elapsed the merchant gets
suspicious, opens the bag and discovers that he has been duped.

<span id="fn_771"></span>[127:5](mhm38.htm#fr_771.md) *Him who passes
behind:* The thief goes with an accomplice to a shop and asks íor
something which he cleverly passes unobserved to his fellow who
immediately runs away with it. He then pretends to be very much upset
and exclaims: 'What am Ito do? The fellow has gone off with it!'

<span id="fn_772"></span>[127:6](mhm38.htm#fr_772.md) *Him who steals in
fetters:* The robber appears as an escaped prisoner in fetters and tells
a pitiful tale how he has been unjustly dealt with. You pity him, loose
his bonds, and treat him kindly. He repays your kindness by robbing you
the first opportunity he gets.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[127:7](mhm38.htm#fr_773.md) *Him who beats with
the shoe:* The sharper takes off his old shoes to beat some one who has
a good pair. The latter takes his off to retaliate and in the struggle
that ensues the former makes off with the good shoes of the latter!

<span id="fn_774"></span>[127:8](mhm38.htm#fr_774.md) *Him who questions
the truth:* The thief knows you have a certain sum of money with you. He
approaches you and says he has goods to sell of greater value than the
money you possess, but he is willing to take what you actually have. He
then asks if you have the amount with you and you say 'Yes'. He will
retort 'Never'. Then you produce it and count it. If he can contrive to
get hold of it he will swear it does not belong to you. Then he either
bolts with all or makes a compromise with you.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[128:1](mhm38.htm#fr_775.md) *Him who got the
better of then:* That is, the thieves. This story has been suppressed on
grounds of decency.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[128:2](mhm38.htm#fr_776.md) *And a phantom:*
Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[128:3](mhm38.htm#fr_777.md) *In a garb not his
own:* The usual garb of night is darkness, so that 'not his own' would
mean brightness, i.e. moonlight. Night personified is here regarded as
masculine.

This maqáma may be compared to Harírí, xxx, 372, in which we have
examples of the cant of beggars, mountebanks, prestigiators and the
like. Here Hamadhání gives illustrations of the methods pursued by the
fraternity of burglars, thieves, sharpers, swindlers, pickpockets and
the like. Cf. Gaubari, *Endickte Geheimnisse* (von de Goéje Z.D.M.G.),
xx, 504.
