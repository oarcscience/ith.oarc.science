### XVIII. THE MAQAMA OF QAZWIN

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: In the year A.H. 75 <span
id="fr_464"></span>[3](#fn_464) I took part in a raid, on the frontier
of Qazwín, <span id="fr_465"></span>[4](#fn_465) with those that raided
it. We crossed not a rugged upland, but we also descended into a valley,
until our march brought us to one of the villages. The scorching
noon-day heat impelled us to seek the shade of some tamarisk trees in
the centre <span id="fr_466"></span>[5](#fn_466) of which was a spring,
like unto the flame of a torch, <span id="fr_467"></span>[6](#fn_467)
more limped than a tear, gliding over the stony ground as glides the
restless serpent. We took what food we were inclined to take, then we
sought the shade and addressed ourselves to the noon-day nap. But sleep
had not yet overcome us when we heard a voice more disagreeable than the
braying of an ass <span id="fr_468"></span>[7](#fn_468) and a footfall
lighter than that of a camel's colt; accompanying these two was the
sound of a drum which seemed to proceed from the jaws of a lion and
which drove away

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

the scout of sleep from the people. I opened both my eyes <span
id="fr_469"></span>[1](#fn_469)and looked towards him, but the trees
intervened between us. So I listened and lo! he was reciting to the beat
of the drum:--

'I invite to God, <span id="fr_470"></span>[2](#fn_470) is there an
answerer?  
To a spacious shelter and luxuriant pasture.  
To a lofty garden <span id="fr_471"></span>[3](#fn_471) the fruits
whereof <span id="fr_472"></span>[4](#fn_472) cease not to be near to
gather and never vanish from sight.  
O people, verily I am a man returning <span
id="fr_473"></span>[5](#fn_473)  
From the land of infidelity, and wondrous is my story.  
If now I have believed, how many nights  
Have I denied my Lord and committed the questionable thing? <span
id="fr_474"></span>[6](#fn_474)  
Ah! many the swine the ends of whose soft bones I have chewed,  
And the intoxicant of which I have obtained a share!  
Then did God guide me and zealous and effectual endeavour raised me from
the baseness of unbelief,  
But I continued to conceal my religion from my people,  
And to worship God with a penitent heart.  
I adored the goddess al-Lát, <span id="fr_475"></span>[7](#fn_475) for
fear of the enemy,  
And in dread of the Watcher, I looked not towards the Ka‘ba.  
I besought God when night enveloped me and dreadful day wasted me,  
Lord, as Thou hast saved me,  
Now deliver me, for I am a stranger among them.  
Then did I take the night as my steed,  
And I had before me  <span id="fr_476"></span>[8](#fn_476) no spare
mount, except resolution.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

Suffice thee to know of my journey, that it was in a night,  
In which the head of a child would almost turn grey,  
Until I passed from the enemy's territory  
Into the guarded domain of the Faith, and then I shook off fear.  
When the signs of the Faith came in sight, I said:  
Assistance from God and a speedy victory.' <span
id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_477)

Now, when he reached this verse, he said: 'O people! I have
entered <span id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_478) your dwelling with a
resolution which love hath not excited, nor poverty impelled. I have
left behind my back gardens planted with trees, and vineyards,
damsels <span id="fr_479"></span>[3](#fn_479) of equal age with swelling
breasts, and excellent horses, <span id="fr_480"></span>[4](#fn_480)
heaped up wealth, <span id="fr_481"></span>[5](#fn_481) equipments, a
numerous tribe, mounts and slaves: But I came forth as the serpent
issues from its hole, <span id="fr_482"></span>[6](#fn_482) and the bird
goes forth from its nest, preferring my religion to my worldly
possessions, bringing my right to my left, <span
id="fr_483"></span>[7](#fn_483) and joining my day march to my night
journey. Now I pray ye will ye combat the fire with its own
sparks, <span id="fr_484"></span>[8](#fn_484) and stone the Byzantine
empire with its own missiles, and with assistance and aid, with support
and succour, and help me in invading them, but not exceeding bounds,
every one according to his several ability and in proportion to his
wealth? I will not regard a bag of ten thousand dirhems too much; I will
accept a mite <span id="fr_485"></span>[9](#fn_485) and not decline a
date. For each one from me

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

there will be two arrows, <span id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_486) one of
which I will sharpen for future recompense, and the other I will notch
with prayer <span id="fr_487"></span>[2](#fn_487) and with it from the
bow of darkness <span id="fr_488"></span>[3](#fn_488) shoot at the gates
of Heaven.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám 'His admirable diction excited me, so I
cast off the robe of sleep and ran to the company and lo! it was our
Shaikh, Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí, with a sword which he had drawn, and in
a garb which he had adopted as a disguise. Now when he saw me he winked
his eye at me and said: 'May God be merciful to him who from his
abundance <span id="fr_489"></span>[4](#fn_489) will help us and
apportion to us a share of his favours.' Then he took what he got, then
I led him aside and said: 'Art thou of the sons of the Nabateans? <span
id="fr_490"></span>[5](#fn_490) He answered:--

'As is my state with fate,  <span id="fr_491"></span>[6](#fn_491) such
is my state with pedigree.  
'My genealogy is in the hands of Time, if it is hard upon it, it will
change.  
In the evening a Nabatean am I, in the morning an Arab.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_464"></span>[78:3](mhm26.htm#fr_464) *The year A.H. 75:* If
we accept this date the author goes back to the raid made by al-Bara ibn
‘Azíb appointed governor of Rai in A.H. 24. If we take it to be A.H. 375
which is the more probable date, that would place the episode five years
before Hamadhání is said to have left his native city. De Sacy has
adopted the latter view (*Chrestomathie Arabe*, iii, 243.) The year 375
was an eventful one, but there is no allusion to a raid on the frontier
of Qazwín. See Ibn al-Athír, ix, 29-33.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[78:4](mhm26.htm#fr_465) *Qazwín:* A well-known

three goddesses worshipped by the ancient Arabians. The other two were
al-‘Uzza and Manáh.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[79:8](mhm26.htm#fr_476) … *Before me* does not
yield a good sense: … by my side, would be better.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[80:1](mhm26.htm#fr_477) *Assistance from God
and a speedy victory:* Qur’án lxi, 13. This text was the battle cry of
the early Muslims. Cf. De Sacy, *Ḥarírí*, p. 231, line 4.

Its weight in the present day is one hundred pounds. … aggregated, the

determination to step forward, opposite of, I advanced one foot and drew
back the other, as a sign of indecision, or (2) bringing the hands
together as a sign of resolution, or (3) clenching the hands as a sign
of determination.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[80:8](mhm26.htm#fr_484) *Combat the fire with
its own sparks:* This appears to be a proverbial expression.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[80:9](mhm26.htm#fr_485) … *A mite:* the weight
of an ant. See Qur’án xxxiv, 3.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[81:1](mhm26.htm#fr_486) … *Two arrows:* The
primitive meaning of … is missile with which one draws lots in the game
called al-maisar, then applied to the thing won by him whose arrow is
successful in the game above mentioned.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[81:2](mhm26.htm#fr_487) … *With prayer:* for
present need.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[81:3](mhm26.htm#fr_488) … *From the bow of
darkness:* A reference to the belief that prayer at night is more
effectual; another reading is … thirst.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[81:4](mhm26.htm#fr_489) *His abundance:*
Literally, his superfluous skirts.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[81:5](mhm26.htm#fr_490) … *Art thou of the
sons of the Nabateans?* Another, and more appropriate reading in the
Constantinople edition, and in the Cambridge MS is 'Art thou of the
children of the daughters of the Greeks'?

<span id="fn_491"></span>[81:6](mhm26.htm#fr_491) *As is my state with
fate:* Cf. p. 13 of the Text. Metre, *Khafif*.

This [maqáma](errata.htm#3) is a strange medley of references to
paganism, Christianity and Islám based upon the imaginary conversion of
a Greek to Muḥammadanism.
