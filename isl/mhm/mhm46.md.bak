### XXXVIII. THE MAQAMA OF KHALAF <span id="fr_891"></span>[2](#fn_891.md)

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When I was invested with
authority over Baṣra, and was going down thither from the
Presence, <span id="fr_892"></span>[3](#fn_892.md) there accompanied me on
the boat a youth, as though he were health in the body. He said: 'In the
sides of the world and its directions I am lost, but I can be counted
equal to a thousand and I can take the place of a line. Dost thou desire
to take me as a favourite, <span id="fr_893"></span>[4](#fn_893.md) and not
seek from me any recommendation?' I said: 'What recommendation stronger
than thy excellence, and what means greater than thy wisdom?

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nay, but I will
render thee the service of a friend <span
id="fr_894"></span>[1](#fn_894.md) and be partners with thee in easy and
straitened circumstances.' So we travelled on. Now, when we reached
Baṣra, he disappeared from me for days, and, because of his absence, my
endurance was straitened <span id="fr_895"></span>[2](#fn_895.md) and I had
no patience left, so I searched for him in the interior <span
id="fr_896"></span>[3](#fn_896.md) of the country till I found him. Then I
asked him: 'What didst thou disapprove of and why didst thou flee?' He
said: 'Verily estrangement rankles in the breast as fire is kindled in
the fire-stick. If it be extinguished, it will subside <span
id="fr_897"></span>[4](#fn_897.md) and vanish, but, if it continue to
exist, it will scatter and spread. And the vessel Will fill and
overflow, if the drops fall into it consecutively; and reproach, when it
is left alone, will hatch and lay. <span id="fr_898"></span>[5](#fn_898.md)
No snare catches the free-born like bounty, and no scourge repels him
like rudeness. But, in any case, we look down from above, upon the
generous with an amorous glance, and upon the ignoble with a
contemptuous regard. Therefore he who meets us with a long nose, <span
id="fr_899"></span>[6](#fn_899.md) we will meet him with an elephant's
trunk, and him who regards us askance, we will dispose of for a paltry
price. Now, thou didst not plant me for thy slave to uproot me, nor
didst thou buy me for thy servants to sell me. A man is known by his
servants, as a book i s known by its superscription. Therefore, if their
rudeness was something that thou didst command, what made it necessary?
And, if thou vast not aware of it, that is most surprising.' Then He
said

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

'The two hands of Khalaf <span id="fr_900"></span>[1](#fn_900.md) ibn Aḥmad
have prospered, for he is  
Easy of access, and his servants are respectful.  
Hast thou not observed that generosity passes over mankind  
And takes its abiding place in his hand?'

Said ‘Ísá Ibn Hishám: 'Then he turned away and I followed him to
conciliate him, and I ceased not to soothe him till he turned back after
he had sworn, "I will not go to one whose company is bad." So I gave him
the respect due to him.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_891"></span>[148:2](mhm46.htm#fr_891.md) *Khalaf ibn Ahmed:*
Amír of Sijistan (Seistan) (b. 326, died in prison A.H. 399). The date
of his appointment by the Samanide ruler is not given but in 354 there
is a reference to a revolt against his rule (Ibn al-Athír, viii, 416).
In 393 Maḥmúd of Ghazna wrested Sijistan from him and sent him into
honourable captivity to Juzján, but four years later he was detected in
an attempt to incite Ilik Khan against the conqueror and was kept in
close confinement in Jardiz till his death in A.H. 399. He was a great
patron of letters and is said to have got together a number of learned
men to make an exhaustive compilation of interpretations of the Qur’án.
The result of their labours was a work of a hundred volumes! His cruel
treatment of his sons and the treacherous way he compassed the death of
the Qáḍí Abú Yúsuf have cast a stain upon his memory. (H. F. Ahmedroz in
the *JRAS*, 1901, pp. 524-31, and Ibn al-Athír, ix, 113-123.)

<span id="fn_898"></span>[149:5](mhm46.htm#fr_898.md) … *Hatch and lay:*
The natural order has been reversed for the sake of the rhyme. Probably
an allusion to the tradition quoted by Lane (p. 2362) … The Devil made
his fixed abode among them like as a bird keeps to the place of its eggs
and young ones.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[149:6](mhm46.htm#fr_899.md) … *With a long nose:*
