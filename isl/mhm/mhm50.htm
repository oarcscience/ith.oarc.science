<p>and they arose with alacrity to flee, like shooting sparks of fire. Vexation took possession of them and they slipped away drop by drop,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_945"></A><A HREF="#fn_945"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and they dispersed right and left and I remained on the floor.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_946"></A><A HREF="#fn_946"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> They bequeathed to me regret, and, because of them, tears overwhelmed me. I was not worth a piece of dung, alone, solitary, like the owl branded with ill-luck, sitting down and standing up as if the state in which I had been had never been.</p>  
<p>And I repented when repentance availed me not. Therefore was my comeliness changed to wildness. A deafness came over me worse than that of Rahta the crier. As though I were a monk of the people of al-&#7716;&iacute;ra.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_947"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> The property had gone and derision was left, and there was in my hand only the she-goat's tail.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_948"></A><A HREF="#fn_948"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> I found myself in my house alone, with my liver crushed, because of the fall of my fortune. My tears had furrowed my cheek. I dwelt in an abode whose ruins had been obliterated and whose traces the torrents had effaced, and where the wild beasts roamed and strayed morning and evening. My position had gone, my substance was exhausted and my comfort&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_949"></A><A HREF="#fn_949"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> was diminished. My boon-companions and my old friends deserted me. No head was raised for me and I was not reckoned among the people. More contemptible than Baz&#8216;&iacute; the pottage-maker and Warz&iacute;n the rope-maker. I wandered to and fro on the river bank as if I were a keeper of ducks.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_950"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> I walked barefoot,</p>

<p>I was sadder than al-Khansa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_952"></A><A HREF="#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> over &#7778;akhr, and Hind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_953"></A><A HREF="#fn_953"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> over &#8216;Amr. My reason was lost, my health was good for nothing, my purse was empty and my slave had fled. My evil dreams multiplied and in evil suggestions I exceeded the limit. I became like the Jinn that inhabit houses and the evil spirit of the dwelling. I appeared in the night and hid in the day. I was unluckier than the grave-digger, more burdensome than the rent of the house, more stupid that &#7788;&iacute;&#7789;&iacute; the bleacher, and more foolish than D&aacute;&uacute;d the oil-presser. Scantiness had become my ally and abjectness had encompassed me. And I was outside the pale of the community and hated for the sake of God. I had been Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-&#8216;Anbas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_954"></A><A HREF="#fn_954"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and I became Ab&uacute; &#8216;<A HREF="errata.htm#9">&#8216;Aflas</A>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_955"></A><A HREF="#fn_955"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and Ab&uacute; Faq&#8216;as. I had lost the road, and argument was against me.</p>  
<p>I found no helper and I saw destitution before me. Now, when I perceived the affair had become difficult and that Time had the rabies, I solicited money and behold it was with the two vultures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_956"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and at the parting of the two seas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_957"></A><A HREF="#fn_957"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and more remote</p>

So I started wandering, as though I was the Messiah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_958"></A><A HREF="#fn_958"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and I journeyed over Khur&aacute;s&aacute;n, its deserted and populous parts, to Kirman, Sijistan, J&iacute;lan, Tabaristan, &#8216;Oman, to Sind and India, to Nubia and Egypt, Yemen, &#7716;ij&aacute;z, Mecca and al-&#7788;a&#8216;if. I roamed over deserts and wastes, seeking warmth at the fire and taking shelter with the ass, till both my cheeks were blackened. And thus I collected of anecdotes and fables,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_959"></A><A HREF="#fn_959"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> witticisms and traditions, poems of the humourists, the diversions of the frivolous, the fabrications of the lovesick, the saws of the pseudo-philosophers, the tricks of the conjurors,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_960"></A><A HREF="#fn_960"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the artifices of the artful, the rare sayings of convivial companions, the fraud of the astrologers, the finesse of quacks, the deception of the effeminate, the guile of the cheats,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_961"></A><A HREF="#fn_961"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the devilry of the fiends, such that the legal decisions of al-Sh&#8216;ab&iacute;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_962"></A><A HREF="#fn_962"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> the memory of al-&#7692;abb&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_963"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and the learning of al-Kalb&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_964"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> would have fallen short of.</p>  
<p>And I solicited gifts and asked for presents. I had recourse to influence and I begged. I eulogized and satirized, till I acquired much property, got possession of Indian swords and Yemen blades, fine coats of mail of S&aacute;bur&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_965"></A><A HREF="#fn_965"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> and leathern shields</p>

<p>Now, when I arrived at Baghdad and the people got news of me, and of how I had been prospered in my travels, they were delighted at my arrival, and they all came to me complaining of what loneliness they had experienced on account of my being away, and what had happened to them because of my absence, and they complained of the intensity of longing and the pain of yearning. And each of them began to apologize for what he had done and to manifest regret for what he had committed. So I made them think I had forgiven them and I did not exhibit to them a sign of vindictiveness because of their conduct. Therefore they were pleased, their limbs ceased trembling, and they went away in that belief.</p>  
<p>The next day they returned to me and I detained them with me. Then I dispatched my agent to the market and he did not omit a thing of all that I had charged him to buy. We had a skilful female cook, and I got prepared twenty sorts of pungent fried-meats, divers kinds of omelets, and rare preparations. We ate and then adjourned to the drinking-saloon, and there were presented before them bright and clear old wine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and fair and expert singers.</p>

<p>They betook themselves to their task and we drank, and there passed for us the pleasantest day. Now I had prepared, according to their number, fifteen brinjal baskets, each basket with four handles.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_971"></A><A HREF="#fn_971"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And my slave had hired for each one of them a porter, each porter at two dirhems, and he had informed the porters of the houses of the company, and charged them to present themselves the next evening. And I commanded my slave, who was a crafty one, to give the company to drink by the pint and by the quart,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_972"></A><A HREF="#fn_972"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and to serve them while I fumigated before them with nad, aloes and ambergris. Before an hour had passed they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_973"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> were all dead drunk and unconscious. Their slaves came to us at sunset each one with a horse, or an ass, or a mule, but I told them their masters were passing the night with me and so they went away. Then I sent for Bil&aacute;l, the barber, and I brought him in. I placed food before him and he ate. I gave him wine of Qutrubbul and he drank till he became intoxicated. Then I placed in his mouth two yellow dinars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_974"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and said, 'Do your duty to the company.' And in a single hour he shaved off fifteen beards, and the company became as smooth-faced as the denizens of Paradise.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_975"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>I placed the beard of each one of them pursed in his clothes and with it a letter wherein was written, 'Whoever harbours perfidy against his friend and forsakes faithfulness, this is his recompense and reward,' and I put it in his pocket. Then we tied them up in the baskets. The porters came the next evening and carried them off with a losing return and they reached their homes. But, when they arose in the morning, they perceived in themselves great grief. Not a merchant from among them went forth to his shop, not a clerk to his office, nor could he appear before his brethren. And every day a large crowd of their</p>

<p>dependents, women, boys and men, came and reviled and reproached me, and invoked upon me divine judgement, but I remained silent and did not return them an answer, nor did I heed their words. The news of my treatment of them spread over the City of Peace, and the matter ceased not to magnify until it reached the Waz&iacute;r al-Qasim ibn &#8216;Ubeid-All&aacute;h,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_976"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in this wise. He wanted his clerk but failed to find him and it was reported: 'He is at home and unable to go out.' He asked: 'Why?' And it was said: 'Because of what Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-&#8216;Anbas has done to him for he had the misfortune of being associated with and tried by him.' He laughed heartily and said: 'By Heavens he was perfectly right to do what he did,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_977"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> let him alone, for he understands them best.' Then he sent me a splendid robe of honour, had led to me a horse with a carriage and forwarded to me fifty thousand dirhems as a mark of his admiration of my action. I stayed at home for two months, spending, eating and drinking and then I appeared in public, after concealment, and some of them reconciled themselves to me because of what the Waz&iacute;r had done; and another swore by the triple divorce&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_978"></A><A HREF="#fn_978"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and by the emancipation of his slaves, male and female, that he would never again speak directly to me. By God, whose dignity is great, and whose evidence is exalted! I did not make much of that, nor did I care, nor was the lobe of my ear scratched, nor did my stomach ache. Neither did it injure me, rather did it delight me, and 'it was a need in Jacob's soul which he</p>

And we implore God's aid and we rely upon Him.</p>

It was due to his efforts that the study of pre-Isl&aacute;mic poetry became of such importance to the Muslims, for he frequently quoted verses of the ancient poets in proof of the explanations he gave of difficult passages of the Qur&#8217;&aacute;n. He used to say: 'Whenever you meet with a difficulty in the Qur&#8217;&aacute;n look for its solution in the poems of the Arabs, for these are the registers of the Arab nation.'

He cut off his nose with his own hand and complained to the Queen that &#8216;Amr, the murdered Jadh&iacute;ma's nephew, had done this, because he suspected him of complicity in the betrayal of his master. So plausible a story found ready acceptance with the queen.

Al-Qasim ibn &#8216;Ubeid-All&aacute;h ibn Suleiman ibn Wahb was appointed Waz&iacute;r in A.H. 288, so that the Waz&iacute;r referred to in the narrative must have been al-Qasim's father &#8216;Ubeid-All&aacute;h ibn Suleiman ibn Wahb the Waz&iacute;r of Mu&#8216;tamid and Mu&#8216;ta&#7693;id.</p>  
<p>It was this al-Qasim &#8216;Ubeid-All&aacute;h who poisoned Ibn al-R&uacute;m&iacute; (see note on p. 116), because he dreaded the poet's-satirical attacks. Here again there is some confusion of dates. Ibn Khallikan, ii, 299, gives the date of Ibn al-R&uacute;m&iacute;'s death as 284 or 276, whereas al-Qasim ibn &#8216;Ubeid-All&aacute;h was not appointed Waz&iacute;r until his father's death which took place in A.H. 288.

This is explained to mean that, because of their personal beauty and the favour shown them by the governor, if they all entered by the <A HREF="errata.htm#11">same</A> gate, they might be smitten with the evil eye. This they did and, though they could not have changed God's will concerning them, still it satisfied a desire in Jacob's mind. Bai&#7693;&aacute;w&iacute;'s commentary (Fleischer), i, 466.</p>  
<p>Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-&#8216;Anbas died eighty-three years before Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute; was born. It is evident, therefore, that this maq&aacute;ma is founded on a popular story, handed down from the former, or extracted from one of the numerous works of a humourous character he is said to have composed.</p>  
<p>This lengthy maq&aacute;ma contains no poetry.</p>  
<p>Cf. Shakespeare, <i>Timon of Athens;</i> the themes are identical.</P>
