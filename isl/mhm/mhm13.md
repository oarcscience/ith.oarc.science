### V. THE MAQAMA OF KÚFA

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: When I was in my young days, I
rode my mount into every species of blind folly and urged my courser
into every kind of error until I had drunk of life a delicious draft and
had donned the flowing robes of fortune. But when the day
brightened <span id="fr_202"></span>[5](#fn_202.md) my night and I gathered
up my skirts <span id="fr_203"></span>[6](#fn_203.md) and prepared for the
final judgement, I mounted a tame steed <span
id="fr_204"></span>[7](#fn_204.md) in order to discharge a bounden
duty. <span id="fr_205"></span>[8](#fn_205.md) There accompanied me on the
road a friend in whom I saw nothing wrong to make me repudiate him. Now,
when we had exchanged confessions and confidences, the story revealed
that he was a Kúfan by principle and a Ṣúfí by persuasion, <span
id="fr_206"></span>[9](#fn_206.md) and so we travelled on.

Now, when we alighted at Kúfa, <span id="fr_207"></span>[10](#fn_207.md) we
went to his house and

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

entered it, when the face of day had become sombre <span
id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) and its cheeks darkened. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_209.md) Then, when the eye of the night had
drooped, and the dawn on its lip had sprouted, there was a knock at the
door. <span id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_210.md) We asked, 'What wanderer is
knocking?' He answered: 'The envoy of night and its messenger, the
defeated and hunted of hunger, a well-bred personage in the leash of
misfortune and bad times; a guest, whose tread is light <span
id="fr_211"></span>[4](#fn_211.md) and whose stray <span
id="fr_212"></span>[5](#fn_212.md) is a loaf; a neighbour who asks aid
against hunger and a patched smock; an exile after whose departure the
fire of banishment <span id="fr_213"></span>[6](#fn_213.md) was kindled, in
whose wake the howling dogs have barked, after whom pebbles were cast
and the areas swept. <span id="fr_214"></span>[7](#fn_214.md) His jaded
camel is fatigue; his pleasure is affliction, and between him and his
two chicks is a vast desert.' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám; I took from my purse
the lion's share, <span id="fr_215"></span>[8](#fn_215.md) passed it to him
and said, 'Increase thy demands and we will increase our gifts to thee.'
He replied, 'No fire so hot to cause aloeswood to diffuse its fragrance
as that of generosity, and the envoy of benevolence is met by no one
better than the messenger of gratitude. Therefore, whoever possesses
plenty, let him do good, for generosity will not pass unrewarded <span
id="fr_216"></span>[9](#fn_216.md) by God and man. But as for thee, may God
cause

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

thee to realise thy hopes and give thee the supreme hand. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_217.md) Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: Then we opened the
door for him and said 'Enter' and lo! by Heavens, it was our Shaikh
Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí! So I said:' 'Distressing is the extreme poverty
which thou hast reached and this aspect especially.' Then he smiled, and
indited, saying:--

'Let not my demanding deceive thee,  
I am in a state of affluence <span id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_218.md) so
great that the pocket of joy would tear,  
I could, if I wished, have ceilings of gold.' <span
id="fr_219"></span>[3](#fn_219.md)

who was a contemporary of the Prophet:

…

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span> 'Whosoever doeth good will not lose his
reward. For generosity will not go unrewarded by God and man.' That is
to say, if man does not reward, God will. The Arabs believed this to be
a quotation from the Taurát. *Aghání*, ii, 48 and Goldziher's edition of
Ḥutai‘ah's poems.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[40:1](mhm13.htm#fr_217.md) … *The supreme hand:*
Here used in the sense of the upper, or giving hand, as opposed to the
lower, or receiving hand.

‏כל מי שׁה כסף בידי ידו על העליונה‎

*'Whoever has money (silver) in his hand, his hand is supreme*. See note
on … in the maqáma of the Yellow', Text p. 230.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[40:2](mhm13.htm#fr_218.md) *I am in a state of
affluence:* Metre, *khafif*.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[40:3](mhm13.htm#fr_219.md) *Ceilings of gold:* A
boast rather inconsistent with his actual condition. The Constantinople
edition has this additional line. 'Sometimes I am a Nabatean at other
