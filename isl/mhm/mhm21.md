### XIII. THE MAQAMA OF BASRA

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM: related to us and said: I entered Baṣra <span
id="fr_379"></span>[6](#fn_379) when, as regards age, I was in the prime
of youth; as to attire,

I was clad in the variegated striped stuffs of Yemen, and, in the

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

matter of wealth, I had cattle and sheep. And I came to Mirbad <span
id="fr_380"></span>[1](#fn_380) with some friends upon whom eyes
fastened. <span id="fr_381"></span>[2](#fn_381) We proceeded a short
distance to the recreation grounds among the green plains wherein a
certain spot arrested us and so we alighted there. We made for the
gaming arrows of pleasure and whirled them, throwing off bashfulness, as
there was not one among us <span id="fr_382"></span>[3](#fn_382) who was
not of us. But in less than the twinkling of an eye, there came in our
view the figure <span id="fr_383"></span>[4](#fn_383) of a man which the
hollows lowered from, and the ridges exposed to sight. We
perceived <span id="fr_384"></span>[5](#fn_384) he was coming towards us
and so we craned our necks to see him, till his journeying brought him
to us. He greeted us with the salutation of Islám and we returned him
the due greeting. <span id="fr_385"></span>[6](#fn_385)

Then he ran his eye over us and said: 'O people, there is not one of you
but looks askance at me with excessive caution. Now none can acquaint
you concerning me more truthfully than I can myself. I am a man from
among the citizens of Alexandria <span id="fr_386"></span>[7](#fn_386)
on the Umayyad frontiers. <span id="fr_387"></span>[8](#fn_387)
Excellence was generous to me, <span id="fr_388"></span>[9](#fn_388)
pleasure hailed me, and a distinguished house bred me.

Then did fortune deny me both her meaner and better gifts, and caused
little ones with inflamed crops to follow me,

As if they were serpents <span id="fr_389"></span>[10](#fn_389) in an
arid land,  
Whose venom would be fatal were they to bite.  
When we tarry they send me out to earn,  
And when we travel they ride on me.'

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

The white <span id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_390) hath deserted <span
id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_391) us, the yellow <span
id="fr_392"></span>[3](#fn_392) hath become refractory to us; the
black <span id="fr_393"></span>[4](#fn_393) hath consumed us, the
red <span id="fr_394"></span>[5](#fn_394) hath crushed us. Abú
Málik <span id="fr_395"></span>[6](#fn_395) hath come to us. Abú Jábir
only visits us when we are barren of strength, <span
id="fr_396"></span>[7](#fn_396) and the waters of this Baṣra promote
digestion while her poor are oppressed. Man is occupied in getting
something for his teeth and is in anxiety concerning himself. What then
is the case of him,

'Who roams and roams <span id="fr_397"></span>[8](#fn_397) and then
returns,  
To stay with chicks whose sight is made keen, <span
id="fr_398"></span>[9](#fn_398)  
Whose covering is old, whose hair is matted and dusty so that they are
ever  
Ravenous <span id="fr_399"></span>[10](#fn_399) and lank-bellied.'

Verily to-day they arose in the morning and looked upon a living person
who is like one dead, and at a home which was like no home. They wrung
their hands longingly, put their ribs out of joint, <span
id="fr_400"></span>[11](#fn_400) shed tears and addressed one another by
the name of *Hunger:*

'And poverty in the day of the mean, <span
id="fr_401"></span>[12](#fn_401)  
Is every generous man's badge.  
The generous incline towards the mean,  
And this is one of the signs of the last day.'

 

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

My lords, ye have been chosen by me and I have sworn, verily in them is
advantage. <span id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_402)

'Now is there a youth who will give them a supper, or cover them? And is
there a generous man who will grant them a morning meal, or clothe
them?'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: By Heavens! there had never sought the seclusion
of my ear a speech more winning, estimable, loftier or more original
than that which I heard from him. Perforce we had recourse to our
belts, <span id="fr_403"></span>[2](#fn_403) rejecting our sleeves, and
eschewing our pockets. <span id="fr_404"></span>[3](#fn_404) And I gave
him my ornamented robe <span id="fr_405"></span>[4](#fn_405) and the
company followed my example, <span id="fr_406"></span>[5](#fn_406) and
we said to him: 'Go and join thy children.' So he turned away from us
after thanksgiving, to which he rendered the full meed, and eulogy with
which he filled his mouth.

the Kúfians.
