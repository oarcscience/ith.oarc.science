### XXIV. THE MAQAMA OF THE ASYLUM

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I entered the asylum <span
id="fr_594"></span>[1](#fn_594) of Baṣra and there was with me Abú Dá’úd
the scholastic divine. <span id="fr_595"></span>[2](#fn_595) And I
beheld a madman  <span id="fr_596"></span>[3](#fn_596) who was glancing
at me. Said he: 'If the augury bird is right ye are strangers.' And we
answered: 'It is so.' He said: 'Who are the people? How excellent are
their fathers!' I replied: 'I am 'Ibn Hishám and this is Abú Dá’úd the
theologian.' He enquired: 'Al-’Askarí?' I said: 'Yes.' Then he
exclaimed: 'May the faces be disfigured and the possessors thereof!
Verily free-will <span id="fr_597"></span>[4](#fn_597) belongs to God
and not to his slave, and affairs are in the hands of God and not in
his. Ye Magians of this community <span id="fr_598"></span>[5](#fn_598)
ye live predestined lives, and die victims of a merciless fate. Ye are
forcibly driven doomwards. 'And, if ye had been in your houses, <span
id="fr_599"></span>[6](#fn_599) verily they would have gone forth to
fight, whose slaughter was decreed, to the places where they
died.' <span id="fr_600"></span>[7](#fn_600) If the fact be as ye
describe it, why are ye not just? Ye assert, the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

creator of oppression is an oppressor, then why do ye not say, the
creator of death is mortal? Do ye not surely know that, as to religion,
ye are viler than the Devil, who said, 'Lord because thou hast seduced
me,' <span id="fr_601"></span>[1](#fn_601) for he confessed, but ye have
denied; he believed but ye have disbelieved. Ye say man has been given
free choice and so he chooses. Never! for the free agent would not rip
open his stomach, nor pluck out his eye, nor hurl his son from a crag.
Is, therefore, compulsion aught but what ye perceive it? Now compulsion
is sometimes enforced by reason and sometimes by the scourge. Let it be
to your shame that the Qur’án rouses hatred in you and the Tradition
angers you. When ye hear, 'he whom God causeth to err <span
id="fr_602"></span>[2](#fn_602) shall have no guide, ye pervert
it.' <span id="fr_603"></span>[3](#fn_603) And when ye hear, 'The earth
contracted for me <span id="fr_604"></span>[4](#fn_604) and I was shown
its east and its west', ye disbelieve it. When ye hear, 'Paradise was so
manifested to me <span id="fr_605"></span>[5](#fn_605) that I attempted
to pluck its fruits, and Hell fire was so exhibited to me that I
shielded myself from the heat thereof with my hand,' ye wag your heads
and turn your necks awry. If it be said 'The torture of the tomb,' ye
presage evil, or if it be said, 'The bridge,' ye wink at one another. If
the 'balances' <span id="fr_606"></span>[6](#fn_606) are mentioned, ye
say: 'Its two scales consist of emptiness'. If the 'Book' be spoken of,
ye say: 'The two sides of it are of leather.' <span
id="fr_607"></span>[7](#fn_607) Ye enemies of the Book and the
Tradition! of what do ye presage evil? Do ye mock God and his signs and
his Apostle? <span id="fr_608"></span>[8](#fn_608) A faction
seceded <span id="fr_609"></span>[9](#fn_609) and they were the dross of
the Tradition. Then ye separated yourselves from it, therefore ye

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

are the dross of the corrupt. Hermaphrodites of the Khárijites! <span
id="fr_610"></span>[1](#fn_610) Ye are of their opinion except as to
fighting, and thou, Ibn Hishám, thou believest in part <span
id="fr_611"></span>[2](#fn_611) and rejectest in part. I have heard thou
hast selected for thy bed a fiend from among them. Hath God not
forbidden thee to take an intimate associate <span
id="fr_612"></span>[3](#fn_612) from among them? Woe to thee! makest
thou not a good selection for thy seed? And dost thou pay no regard to
thy posterity?' Then he prayed: 'O God! Give me in exchange for them
better than they and place me with thy heavenly messengers.' Said ‘Ísá.
ibn Hishám: 'I could not, nor could Abú Dá’úd return a reply and we went
away from him in disgrace and verily I was conscious of humiliation in
Abú Dá’úd until we desired to separate. He said: '‘Ísá, by thy father!
This is the fact, but what did he mean by a female fiend?' I answered,
'By Heavens! I know not, except that I had resolved to ask one of them
in marriage, but I had not mentioned what I intended to any one. By God!
I will never do it.' Then he said: 'By Heavens! this is none other than
a devil in bonds.' So we returned and stood before him. And we hastened
to speak and we began questioning. He said: 'Perhaps you both wish to
know of my affair that which you denied.' We said: 'Thou wert previously
acquainted with our affairs and now thou art not mistaken as to what is
in our minds. <span id="fr_613"></span>[4](#fn_613) So explain thy
affair to us and reveal thy secret to us. He recited:

'I am the fountain of wonders. <span id="fr_614"></span>[5](#fn_614)  
In my devising I am the possessor of high degrees.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

In truth, I am the camel's hump. <span id="fr_615"></span>[1](#fn_615)  
In vanity, I am its withers. <span id="fr_616"></span>[2](#fn_616)  
Alexandria is my home, an aimless  
Wanderer am I on God's earth.  
In the monastery I am an abbot,  
In the masjid an ascetic.' <span id="fr_617"></span>[3](#fn_617)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_594"></span>[100:1](mhm32.htm#fr_594) … *The asylum:*
Arabicized from the Persian … a hospital.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[100:2](mhm32.htm#fr_595) *Abú Dá’úd the
scholastic divine:* The person referred to is evidently Abú Bakr
Muḥammad ibn Abdullah al-’Askarí the chief Qáḍí of the Khalífa Al-Mahdí
(A.D. 775-84) at Ruṣáfa. He was one of the most famous of the Mu’tazilás
(*al-Ansáb* of al-Sam’aní, p. 392).

<span id="fn_596"></span>[100:3](mhm32.htm#fr_596) … *a madman:*
Literally, possessed by a jinn, demon, or demoniac.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[100:4](mhm32.htm#fr_597) … *Free-will:* The
doctrine of free-will was no new idea, for we are told that al-’Aasha, a
contemporary of the Prophet, was a believer in it and that he had been
instructed therein by the ‘Ibádites, or Christians, of al-Híra from whom
he used to buy wine. *Aghání*, viii, 76. The orthodox belief is
expressed in *Arab Proverbs*, ii, 405. 'Had I been given free choice, I
should have chosen'. … \[Cf. *Life of Muḥammad* (Wüstenfeld) Band, iv,
1011\]. The Mu‘tazilís were the partisans of free-will (…) as opposed to
orthodox fatalism or predestination (…). For an excellent account of the
origin and development of this sect, see Professor Browne, *Literary
History of Persia*, i, 281-92; *Hibbert Lectures*, v, 214; Shahrastání,
*al-Milal wa’l-Nihal* (Cunton's ed.), pp. 29-30 and Sell, *The Faith of
Islám* (3rd ed.), pp. 194-206.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[100:5](mhm32.htm#fr_598) *Magians of this
community:* An allusion to the spurious tradition … 'The partisans of
free-will are the Magians of the Church', quoted by Abú’l-Ḥasan
al-‘Ash’arí (A, H. 270-330), in the *Ibána*, p. 73, as a genuine
tradition.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[100:6](mhm32.htm#fr_599) *If ye had been in
your houses:* Qur’án, iii, 148.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[100:7](mhm32.htm#fr_600) *The places where
they died:* Literally, sleeping-places.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[101:1](mhm32.htm#fr_601) *Because thou hast
seduced me:* Qur’án, xv, 39.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[101:2](mhm32.htm#fr_602) *Whom God causeth to
err:* Qur’án, vii, 185.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[101:3](mhm32.htm#fr_603) … *Ye pervert it:*
Literally ye turn away from the apparent meaning and twist it. This is
an allusion to the Báṭinites who assert that the Qur’án has an outward
sense and an inward meaning differing from the former and known to them,
i.e. the literal and the allegorical.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[101:4](mhm32.htm#fr_604) … *The earth
contracted for me:* Íbn al-Athír, *Niháyah*, ii, 82.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[101:5](mhm32.htm#fr_605) … *Paradise was
manifested to me:* ibid.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[101:6](mhm32.htm#fr_606) *The balances:* Of
Justice and equity in mutual dealings. Qur’án, iv, 6.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[101:7](mhm32.htm#fr_607) … *Of leather:* i.e.,
something created and not uncreate. An allusion to the dogma that the
Qur’án is uncreate and the belief of the heterodox that it is something
created.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[101:8](mhm32.htm#fr_608) *God and His signs
and His Apostle:* Qur’án, ix, 66.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[101:9](mhm32.htm#fr_609) … *A faction
seceded:* An allusion to the withdrawal of Wáṣit ibn ‘Aṭá, the founder
of the Mu‘tazila sect.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[102:1](mhm32.htm#fr_610) … *The Khárijites:*
'The Seceders, or Theocratic Separatists'. The pious fanatics in ‘Alí's
army who forced him to submit to arbitration at the battle of Siffin
(A.D. 657) and afterwards blamed him for doing so, and, because he would
not publicly confess, what they denounced as his disloyalty to God for
having submitted the question of the succession to the Khalífate, for
which he and Mu‘áwíya, the Governor of Syria, were contending, to
arbitration, they seceded from him, No less than twelve thousand of
these fanatical malcontents separated themselves from him and adopted as
their war-cry, … 'Arbitration belongs to God alone'. Browne, *Literary
of History of Persia*, i, 220. Al-Fakhrí (Ahlwardt), p. 114.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[102:2](mhm32.htm#fr_611) *Thou believest in
part:* An allusion to Qur’án, ii, 79.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[102:3](mhm32.htm#fr_612) … *an intimate
associate:* Literally the lining of a garment; metaphorically an
intimate and [familiar](errata.htm#5) friend. In the text it means a
wife. See Qur’án, iii, 114.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[102:4](mhm32.htm#fr_613) *Minds:* Literally,
breasts.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[102:5](mhm32.htm#fr_614) *I am the fountain of
wonders:* Metre, *ramal*.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[103:1](mhm32.htm#fr_615) … *The camel's hump:*
Figure for height or prominence.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[103:2](mhm32.htm#fr_616) *Withers:* Figure for
less high, or less prominent.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[103:3](mhm32.htm#fr_617) In this maqáma the
author introduces an extremely polemical subject, the doctrines of
free-will and predestination. Abú’1-Fatḥ in the character of a madman in
bonds champions the orthodox opinion, and Abú Dá’úd and ‘Ísá ibn Hishám,
the partisans of free-will, are silenced and discomfited. Hamadhání's
own opinion was clearly against the doctrine of free-will. See his
Letters, pp. 27-8.
