### III. THE MAQAMA OF BALKH

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: Trade in cotton stuffs took me
to Balkh <span id="fr_161"></span>[4](#fn_161.md) and I arrived there when
I was in the first flush <span id="fr_162"></span>[5](#fn_162.md) of youth,
with a mind free from care and a body decked with the ornaments of
affluence. My only aim was to subdue to my use the unbroken colt of the
mind, or to capture a few stray

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

sayings <span id="fr_163"></span>[1](#fn_163.md). But, during my entire
stay, nought more eloquent than my own words sought admission to my ear.
Now when separation bent, or was about to bend, its bow at us, there
came into my presence a youth in an attractive  <span
id="fr_164"></span>[2](#fn_164.md) dress with a beard that extended so far
as to pierce the two arteries attached to the jugular vein, and with
eyes which had absorbed the waters <span id="fr_165"></span>[3](#fn_165.md)
of the two rivers <span id="fr_166"></span>[4](#fn_166.md). He met me with
such benefaction that I proportionately increased my praise of it. Then
he asked me: 'Dost thou intend to go on a journey?' I replied: 'Yes,
indeed.' He said, 'May thy scout find good pasture and thy guide not
lose his way! When dost thou intend to start?' I answered, 'Early
to-morrow morning.' Then he indited the following:--

'May it be a morn divine and not a morn of departure,  
The bird auguring union, <span id="fr_167"></span>[5](#fn_167.md)  
'And not the bird of separation.' <span id="fr_168"></span>[6](#fn_168.md)

Whither art thou going? I replied: 'To my own country.' He said, 'Mayest
thou reach thy native land and accomplish thy business; but when dost
thou return? I answered, 'Next year.' <span
id="fr_169"></span>[7](#fn_169.md) He then said: 'Mayest thou fold the
robes and roll up the thread? <span id="fr_170"></span>[8](#fn_170.md)
Where art thou in regard to generosity?' I answered, 'Where thou
desirest.' He said, 'If God bring thee back in safety

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

from this road, bring with thee for me an enemy in the guise of a
friend, in golden vein that invites to infidelity, spins on the finger,
round as the disc of the sun, that lightens the burden of debt and plays
the rôle of the two-faced.' <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_171.md) Said
‘Ísá ibn Hishám: 'Then I knew it was a dinar that he demanded. So I said
to him, Thou canst have one down and the promise of another one like
it.' He then recited and said:--

'Thy plan is better than what I asked for, <span
id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_172.md)  
Mayest thou continue to be the worthy doer of generous deeds, <span
id="fr_173"></span>[3](#fn_173.md)  
Thy branches overspreading and thy root be healthy.  
I cannot endure the burden of gifts,  
Nor bear the weight of mendicity.  
My imagination fell short of the extent of thy generosity  
And thy doing has exceeded my fancy.  
O prop of fortune and greatness  
May time never be bereft of thee!'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: Then I gave him the dinar and said to him: Where
is the native soil of this excellence? He answered: I was reared by the
Quraish, and in its oases nobility was prepared for me. One of those
present asked: Art thou not Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí and did I not see
thee in ‘Iráq going about the streets begging <span
id="fr_174"></span>[4](#fn_174.md) with letters? <span
id="fr_175"></span>[5](#fn_175.md) Then he recited, saying:--

'Verily, God has servants <span id="fr_176"></span>[6](#fn_176.md)  
Who have adopted a manifold <span id="fr_177"></span>[7](#fn_177.md)
existence,

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

In the evening they are Arabs,  
In the morning Nabateans.' <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_178.md)

<span id="fn_161"></span>[32:4](mhm11.htm#fr_161.md) *Balkh*: The ancient
Bactria or Zariaspa, and formerly called Alexandria, was once a great
city, but is now, for the most part, a mass of ruins which occupy a
space of about twenty miles in circuit. It was at one time--the granary
of Khurásán. Captured by the Arabs in the Khalífate of ‘Uthmán (A.D.
644-56). Yaqút, i, 713.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[32:5](mhm11.htm#fr_162.md) … *First flush:*
Literally, virginity.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[33:1](mhm11.htm#fr_163.md) … *Stray sayings:*
from … applied to a runaway and refractory camel, hence strange and
unfamiliar words.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[33:2](mhm11.htm#fr_164.md) … *Attractive:*
Literally, full of eye.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[33:3](mhm11.htm#fr_165.md) *Had absorbed the
waters:* They were so liquid and limpid.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[33:4](mhm11.htm#fr_166.md) … *The two rivers:* an
appellation applied to the Euphrates and the Tigris. From … a giver or
tributary, e.g. … a river that has two other rivers flowing into it.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[33:5](mhm11.htm#fr_167.md) *The bird of union:*
The hoopoo … being suggestive of … he guided him. See Meidání, i,
(Bulak-edition) and also Professor Margoliouth's 'Letters of Abú’l ‘Alá
al-Ma‘arrí,' p. 42.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[33:6](mhm11.htm#fr_168.md) *The bird of
separation:* The raven which is called … the raven of separation and
whose appearance or croak is ominous of separation . See Meidání, i, 337
(Bulak edition.) Metre, *wafir*.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[33:7](mhm11.htm#fr_169.md) *Next year:*
Literally, the coming (year).

<span id="fn_170"></span>[33:8](mhm11.htm#fr_170.md) *Mayest thou fold the
robes and roll up the thread*. A figure used by the author to express
the idea of traversing safely the intervening stages to one's
destination. Cf. p. 230 of the Text.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[34:1](mhm11.htm#fr_171.md) *The two-faced:* Cf.

figure for strength of character.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[34:4](mhm11.htm#fr_174.md) … *Begging:* from … to
beg. De Sacy says the word is arabicized from the Persian … a beggar and
… beggary. (*Chrestomathie Arabe*, iii, 250.) The fact that both Badí‘
al-Zamán and Ḥarírí regarded the profession of begging as one of Persian
origin--see note on the Sons of Sásán, (Text p. 89)--supports this
derivation. For an earlier use of the word … beggary, see Dieterici's
edition of *Philosophie der Araber*, Thier and Mensch, p. 32, lines 10
seq.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[35:1](mhm11.htm#fr_178.md) *Nabateans:* A
well-known Arabian people. In the time of Josephus their settlements
gave the name Nabatene to the borderland between Syria and Arabia from
the Euphrates to the Red Sea. Before their appearance in history, about
312 B.C., they had already some tinge of civilization. Though true Arabs
they came under the influence of Aramean culture, and Syriac was the
language of their coins and inscriptions when the tribe grew into a
kingdom and profited by the decay of the Selucids to extend itself over
the country east of the Jordan. As allies of the Romans they continued
to flourish throughout the first Christian century. About A.D. 105,
Trajan most unwisely broke up the Nabatean nationality. Encl. Bib., iii,
3254-5.
