<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: Separation once hurled me hither and thither until I reached the utmost confines of Jurj&aacute;n.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Here, to fortify myself against the days, I took some arable land which I proceeded to cultivate. I invested in some goods as my stock-in-trade, settled upon a shop as my place of business, and selected some friends whom I made my companions.</p>  
<p>I stayed at home in the morning and in the evening, and, between these times, I was at the shop.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Now one day, when we were seated together discussing poetry&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and poets, there was sitting, but a short distance off, a youth listening as if he understood, and remaining silent as though he did not know, until we were carried away by our discussion and lengthy disputation, when he said: 'Ye have found the little palm tree loaded with fruit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and got the little rubbing-post.

Come near, for thou hast inspired us with the feeling that we shall derive much benefit from thee. Speak, for thou hast cut thy wisdom tooth.' He then approached and said: 'Question me, and I will answer you. Listen, and I will delight you.' So we asked him: 'What dost thou say regarding Imr al-Qais?'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> He said: 'He was the first to stand lamenting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> over the encampments and their areas, who set out early while the birds were still in their nests,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and described the points of the horse.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> He did not compose poetry for gain, nor speak eloquently from covetousness and, therefore, he was superior to him whose tongue was loosened designingly and whose fingers were foraging for a prize.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> We next asked: 'What dost thou say to Nabigah?'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> He answered: 'He is as ready to revile, when he is angry, as he is to eulogize when he is pleased; he makes excuses when he is frightened and he shoots not but he hits.' We asked: 'What sayest thou to Zuheir?' He answered: 'Zuheir&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> melts poetry and poetry melts him.

We said: 'What is thy opinion of the modern and the ancient poets?'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_139"></A><A HREF="#fn_139"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> He answered: 'The language of the ancients is nobler and their themes more delightful, whereas the conceits of the moderns are more refined and their style more elegant.' We then said: 'If thou wouldst only exhibit some of thy poetry and tell us something about thyself.' He replied: 'Here are answers to both questions in one essay:--</p>

Then I said: 'Al-Iskander&iacute; by Heavens', for he had left us young&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and had now returned full grown.

He is classed with the authors of the <i>Mu&#8216;allaq&aacute;t</i> (see ed. by Lyall, p. 152) and is said to have had a close acquaintance with Christianity. For a fuller notice of this poet, see Nicholson, p. 121 and <i>Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, ix, 154.</P>

He is remarkable for his wise sayings and moral reflections. It is said of him he only praised a man for what was in him. Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute;'s opinion of him--Zuheir melts poetry and poetry melts him--is no exaggerated estimate of his poetic genius. He was one of the triad of pre-Isl&aacute;mic poets, the other two being Imr al-Qais and Nabigah. <i>Shu&#8216;ar&aacute; al-Na&#7779;raniah</i>, p. 510.</P>

He early developed a talent for satire which cost him his life at the early age of twenty, so that he is generally called the 'youth of twenty'.

He was famous for his satire, He survived al-Farazdaq, his lifelong rival, but a short time--either thirty or forty days. Nicholson, p. 244 and <i>Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, vii, 35.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_138"></A><A HREF="mhm09.htm#fr_138">28:8</A> Farazdaq and Jar&iacute;r are connected by a strange rivalry. For years they were engaged in a public scolding competition in which they roundly abused each other, and exhibited their marvellous skill in manipulating the vast resources of vituperation of the Arabic language. See The <i>Naka&#8217;i&#7693;</i> or <i>Flytings</i> of Jar&iacute;r and Farazdaq in three volumes edited by Professor A. A. Bevan (Leyden, 1905-12). The relative merits of Jar&iacute;r and Farazdaq were a favourite subject for discussion. See <i>Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, vii, 37 and Nicholson, p 239.</p>  
<p>It is difficult to gather from Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute;'s comparison of these two poets as to which of them he accords the palm. Probably he intended the question to remain undecided. Y&uacute;nas says: 'I have never been in an assembly where the company was unanimous as to which of the two was the better poet.' The Arabs, while they considered Jar&iacute;r, al-Farazdaq and al-Akhtal to be the three greatest Isl&aacute;mic poets, differed in the matter of assigning precedence to them. <i>Kit&aacute;b al-Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>. vii, 36. Comparison of poets formed a branch of <i>belles lettres</i> (<FONT COLOR="GREEN">&#8230;</FONT>). See <i>Agh&aacute;n&iacute;</i>, iii, 101 and viii, 75.</P>
