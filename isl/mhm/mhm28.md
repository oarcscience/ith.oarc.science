### XX. THE MAQAMA OF THE APE

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: While I was in the city of
Peace, <span id="fr_504"></span>[1](#fn_504) returning from the Sacred
Territory, <span id="fr_505"></span>[2](#fn_505) I was swaggering along,
with the swaggering of pedestrians, on the bank of the Tigris, observing
those rare sights and closely examining those embellishments until,
suddenly, I reached a ring of men crowding together, excitement
agitating their heads <span id="fr_506"></span>[3](#fn_506) and laughter
exploding <span id="fr_507"></span>[4](#fn_507) their cheeks. Curiosity
impelled me to do what it had driven them to do, till I stood within
earshot of the voice of a man without being able to see his face,
because of the intensity of the thronging and the excessiveness of the
crowding, and behold! it was a monkey-trainer causing his monkey to
dance and making those near him to laugh. So I bounded as bounds the
well-trained hound, <span id="fr_508"></span>[5](#fn_508) and went
forward, after the manner of one lame, over the necks of the people.
This one's shoulder throwing me in that one's stomach, <span
id="fr_509"></span>[6](#fn_509) until I made the beards of two men my
carpet and sat down after much fatigue. <span
id="fr_510"></span>[7](#fn_510) And verily shame choked me with its
spittle and the straitness of the place distressed me. When the
monkey-trainer had finished his performance and the place of assembly
divested itself of its people, I arose, and verily terror had clothed me
in its garb, and I stood up that I might see his face, and lo! by
Heavens! it was Abú’l-Fatḥ, al-Iskanderí. So I said: 'Sirrah, what
meaneth this baseness?' Then he indited saying:--

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

'The sin is the days’ <span id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_511) not mine,  
So censure the vicissitudes of the nights.  
By means of folly I obtained my desire  
And proudly trailed my embellished skirts.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_504"></span>[84:1](mhm28.htm#fr_504) *The city of Peace:*
i.e., the city of God. Al-Manṣúr is said to have called Baghdad the city
of Peace--Madína al-Salám--because the Tigris had been previously called
the valley and river of Peace. It is said ‘Abd al-‘Azíz ibn ‘Alí Ruwwid
called it the city of Peace, because in Persian *bagh* is an idol and
*dad* a gift which made an impious or ill-omened name. Yaqút, i, 678.
See also Le Strange, *Baghdad during the ‘Abbásid Khalífate*, p. 10.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[84:2](mhm28.htm#fr_505) *The sacred
territory:* Mecca.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[84:3](mhm28.htm#fr_506) … *Their heads:*
Literally, their necks.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[84:4](mhm28.htm#fr_507) *Exploded (literally,
split) their cheeks:* Cf. English, split their sides.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[84:5](mhm28.htm#fr_508) … *Well-trained
hound:* Literally, having a collar of white shells such as are worn on
the neck to avert the evil eye. It seems that only trained hounds were
given this collar.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[84:6](mhm28.htm#fr_509) … *Stomach:*
Literally, the navel.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[84:7](mhm28.htm#fr_510) … *great fatigue:*
Another reading is … between two.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[85:1](mhm28.htm#fr_511) *The sin is the days:*
Metre, *kámil*.

This maqáma has been translated by De Sacy. See his *Chrestomathie
Arabe*, iii. p. 246.
