<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: When I was in Baghdad,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="mhm19.htm#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> I longed for some of the Azaz date, but I had no cash knotted up. So I went out to the shops seeking an opportunity until my desire put me down at Karkh,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> when lo!</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> I chanced upon a rustic&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> urging his ass along his waist-wrapper, tapering on one side with the weight of the money tied up in it. Then I said: 'By Heavens, we have secured a quarry!' and I addressed him with, 'Greeting on thee, Ab&uacute; Zaid! whence art thou come, and where art thou staying, and when didst thou arrive? Come, let us go to the house.' The rustic said: 'I am not Ab&uacute; Zaid, but Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubaid.' I exclaimed, 'Of course; God curse the devil&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and put away forgetfulness; length of time and distance made me forget thee; and how is thy father? Is he as young as he was when I knew him, or has he aged since I left?' He answered: 'The spring pasture&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> has grown over and obliterated the traces&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of his grave and I hope God may receive him to His paradise.' I exclaimed: 'Verily we are God's and to him do we return! There is neither strength,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> nor power except in God, the High, the Great'; and my hand flew&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to my undershirt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> as if I wished to rend it. But the rustic clasped my waist with his hands and said: 'I adjure thee by God not to rend it.' Then I said: 'Let us go to the house and get some food, or to the market and buy some roast meat, for the market is nearer and the food there nicer.' Thus did I excite in him a fierce craving for meat, and incline him with</p>

<p><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the inclination of gobbling and greed, and he became greedy. But he did not know he had fallen into the trap.</p>  
<p>Then we came to a fried-meat seller's whose roasted meats&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> were dripping with fat, and whose cakes were streaming with gravy. I said: 'Put aside for Ab&uacute; Zaid a portion from this fried meat and then weigh him some of that sweetmeat. Take some of those plates and place upon them some of these wafer-cakes and sprinkle upon them some juice of the Summak&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> berry, in order that Ab&uacute; Zaid may eat and relish it.' So the fried-meat seller, with his long knife, bent over the choicest productions of his oven, chopped them as small as collyrium grains and pounded them as fine as flour. The rustic sat down and I did likewise. He spoke not neither did I speak&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> till we had eaten all. Then I said to the <i>halwa-seller:</i> Weigh for Ab&uacute; Zaid two pounds of confection of almonds, for it is the easiest to swallow and the quickest to penetrate through the veins.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> It should have been made overnight,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> spread out in the day, crisp, well stuffed, of pearl-like lustre and starry hue, and should dissolve in the mouth like gum, before it is chewed, in order that Ab&uacute; Zaid may eat and enjoy it. He said: 'And</p>

<p>he weighed it.' So we got to work&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_374"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and ate till we finished it. Then I said: 'Ab&uacute; Zaid, how badly we need some iced water to quench this thirst and to allay the heat generated by this meal. Sit down, Ab&uacute; Zaid, till we fetch thee a water-carrier to bring thee a drink of water.' Then I went out and sat where I could see him but he could not observe me, in order to see what he would do. When the rustic perceived that I delayed, he arose and went towards his ass, but the fried-meat seller clung to his waist-wrapper and said: 'Where is the cost of what thou hast eaten?' Said Ab&uacute; Zaid: 'I ate it as a guest.' Then the fried-meat seller struck him a blow with his fist and followed it up with a cuff, saying: 'Take that, base-born fellow! When did we invite thee? Pay&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_375"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> down twenty dirhems.' The rustic began to weep .and to untie the knots with his teeth saying, 'How often did I tell that contemptible ape,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> "I am Ab&uacute; &#8216;Ubaid"', and he would say:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'Nay but thou art Ab&uacute; Zaid'.</DIR></p>  
<p>Then I indited:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'To obtain thy livelihood&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> make use of every means;<br> Do not be satisfied with any condition,<br> But be equal to any enormity;<br> For man becomes incapable,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> there is no doubt about it.'</DIR></p>

Two reasons are assigned for this: (1) A patrician came to Baghdad as an ambassador from the Byzantine court. After he had been taken over the city, Man&#7779;&uacute;r asked him what he thought of it. He replied, 'It is a beautiful and well-fortified town, but for the fact that your enemies are within its walls.' Man&#7779;&uacute;r asked who they were. The ambassador answered: The merchants who come from all parts as spies, find out all they want to know and go away again and you are none the wiser?' After the departure of the Ambassador, Man&#7779;&uacute;r had all the trades-people removed outside the city to Karkh. (2) The Khal&iacute;fa found that the smoke from the shops was spoiling the walls of the gates, and to get rid of this smoke nuisance he had them transferred to Karkh. Yaq&uacute;t, i, 677.</P>
