### XLV. THE MAQAMA OF KINGS

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was on my way back from Yemen
and making for my native land. I was journeying in a night when nothing
auspicious save the hyena passed from the left, and nothing inauspicious
from the right save a lion. Now when the blade of the morning was drawn,
and the brow of the orb of day came forth, there appeared before me on
the bare plain a rider fully armed. There seized me because of him, what
seizes an unarmed person from the like of him when he advances. But I
put on a bold front, stood and said: 'Perish thy mother! Stand! Before
thou canst attain thy object thou wilt have to endure wounds of steel,
strip the tragacanth of its leaves, and face the pride of an
Azdite. <span id="fr_1022"></span>[1](#fn_1022.md) I am for peace <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[2](#fn_1023.md) if thou wilt, but who art thou?' He
answered: 'Peace hast thou found and a travelling companion according to
thy desire.' I then said: 'Thou hast answered well.' So we travelled on
and, when we had become mutually intimate and exchanged confidences, the
story revealed Abú’l Fatḥ al-Iskanderí, and he asked me concerning the
most generous of kings I had met. So I mentioned the kings of Syria and
the generous ones among them, the kings of ‘Iráq and the noble ones of
them, and the Amirs of

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

the provinces, and I extended <span id="fr_1024"></span>[1](#fn_1024.md)
the enumeration to the kings of Egypt. I narrated what I had seen and I
recounted to him the benevolent acts of the kings of Yemen and the
favours of the kings of Ṭá’if, and I concluded the praise of all by
mentioning Saif al-Daula. Then he recited saying:--

'O nocturnal traveller <span id="fr_1025"></span>[2](#fn_1025.md) by the
stars of the night, praising them,  
Had he but seen the sun, he would not have considered them to be of any
importance,  
And, O praiser of the streams, I grant thou hast not visited the
encircling ocean, but dost thou know nothing of it?  
He who has seen the pearl will not compare a stone with it,  
And whoever has seen a Khalaf will not think of any other man.  
Visit him and thou wilt visit a king who has been given four, <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[3](#fn_1026.md)  
That no one has acquired, so observe him and thou wilt see,  
His days are bright and his countenance is as the moon,  
His determination is like Fate and his gifts like rain;  
I ceased not to praise people whom I thought  
To be the purity of the age but, compared with him, they were turbid.'

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: So I asked: 'Who is this compassionate and
generous king?' He replied: 'How can that be which the imagination
cannot grasp, and how can I express that which reason will not accept?
Now, when was there a king who disdained noble men when they gave
silver <span id="fr_1027"></span>[4](#fn_1027.md) while gold, a thousand
pieces of it, is the easiest thing for him to give and nothing vexes him
but evil words?' <span id="fr_1028"></span>[5](#fn_1028.md) And a mountain
of collyrium is

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

decreased by the style, then how is it this bountiful giving does not
affect his fortune? And can there be a king, who, in the matter of
bounty, is referable to squandering, and, in the matter of character, to
sublimity, and, in the matter of religion, to devotion, and, in the
matter of royalty, to universal empire, and, in the matter of origin, to
the most ancient, and, in the matter of descendants, to the most recent?

'Would that I knew <span id="fr_1029"></span>[1](#fn_1029.md) what he,
whose gracious qualities these are, expects to get more by reaching the
Pleiades.'

treachery towards the governor of Kirman, and the murder of the Qáḍí Abú
Yúsuf show that he was not the paragon of excellence Hamadhání makes him
appear to be. See Ibn al-Athír, ix, 58-9.
