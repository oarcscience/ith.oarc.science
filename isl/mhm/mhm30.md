------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XXII. THE MAQAMA OF THE MADIRAH

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was in Baṣra and with me was
Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskanderí, the man of eloquence who summons it and it
responds to him, the man of rhetoric who commands it and it obeys him.
We were present with him at a merchant's entertainment and there was
placed before us maḍirah <span id="fr_529"></span>[2](#fn_529.md) which did
credit to the townsfolk, <span id="fr_530"></span>[3](#fn_530.md)
oscillated in a large dish, announced health <span
id="fr_531"></span>[4](#fn_531.md) and testified to the Khalífate of

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mu‘awiya, <span
id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_532) (may God have mercy upon him!.md) in a dish
which dazzled the eye <span id="fr_533"></span>[2](#fn_533.md) and wherein
beauty was bestirring itself. <span id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_534.md) When
it took its place upon the table and its home in the hearts, Abú’l-Fatḥ
al-Iskanderí arose <span id="fr_535"></span>[4](#fn_535.md) cursing it and
its owner, manifesting repugnance to it and its eater and reviling it
and its cook. We thought he was joking, but behold! the reverse was the
fact, and jest was the essence of earnestness. He withdrew from the
table and abandoned co-operation with his brethren. So we ordered it to
be removed and it was taken away, and with it the hearts; eyes travelled
behind it, mouths watered for it, lips were licked for it, livers were
inflamed <span id="fr_536"></span>[5](#fn_536.md) after it and hearts
followed in its trail. But we associated ourselves with him in
separation from it and we enquired of him the fact concerning it. He
answered: 'My story regarding it is more extensive than my misfortune in
it and, if I were to relate it to you, I should not be secure from hate
and from wasting time.' We said: 'Produce it.' He said: 'While I was in
Baghdad a merchant invited me to partake of maḍirah and he clung to me
with the clinging of a pressing creditor, and of the dog to the
companions of al-Raqím, <span id="fr_537"></span>[6](#fn_537.md) till I
accepted his invitation to it, so we started. Now the whole way he was
praising his wife

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

and ready to sacrifice his heart's blood <span
id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_538.md) for her, eulogising her cleverness in
her art, and her excellent taste in cooking, saying, 'Sir, if thou wert
to see her with the apron <span id="fr_539"></span>[2](#fn_539.md) tied
round her waist, going about the rooms, from the oven <span
id="fr_540"></span>[3](#fn_540.md) to the cooking-pots, and from the
cooking pots to the oven, blowing the fire with her mouth, pounding the
spices with her hands; and if thou wert to see the smoke discolouring
that beautiful face and affecting that smooth cheek, thou wouldst behold
a spectacle at which eyes would be dazed. I love her because she loves
me, and it is a mark of a man's good fortune that he should be given a
lawful helpmeet and that he should be aided by his spouse, and
especially when she is of his own clay. In near relationship she is my
paternal uncle's daughter, her clay is my clay, her town is my town, her
paternal uncles are my paternal uncles and her origin is my origin. But
in disposition she is more generous than I am, and in form more
beautiful. He bored <span id="fr_541"></span>[4](#fn_541.md) me with his
wife's virtues till we reached his quarter, whereupon he said: 'Sir,
seest thou this quarter? It is the best quarter in Baghdad. Worthy men
vie with one another for settling in it, and the great ones jealously
compete with one another for finding quarters in it; but none but
merchants live in it. Verily a man is known by his neighbour. <span
id="fr_542"></span>[5](#fn_542.md) My house is in the middle of its
belt <span id="fr_543"></span>[6](#fn_543.md) of buildings and is the point
in the centre of its circle. How much dost thou think, Sir, was spent
upon each house in it? Say approximately, if thou dost not know for
certain.' I replied: 'Much.' Said he: 'Good gracious, what a terrible
mistake!' thou sayest 'much' only! and he heaved a deep sigh and
ejaculated: 'Praise Him who knoweth all things!' And we reached the door
of his house and he said: 'This is my house, how much dost thou reckon I
spent on this window? By heavens! I spent upon it beyond my means

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

and what exceeded the limits of poverty. How dost thou find its
workmanship and shape? I adjure thee by God, hast thou ever seen its
like? Observe the fine finish of it. Ponder its curves which seem to
have been drawn with a compass. <span id="fr_544"></span>[1](#fn_544.md)
Regard the skill of the carpenter in the make of this door. Of how many
planks <span id="fr_545"></span>[2](#fn_545.md) did he make it? Say, How do
I know? It is made of teakwood: <span id="fr_546"></span>[3](#fn_546.md)
from one piece which was neither worm-eaten nor rotten. When it is moved
it creaks, and, when it is struck with the finger, it rings. Who made
it, Sir? Abi Isḥáq ibn Muḥammad the Baṣarían made it, and he is, by
Heavens! a man of clean reputation, <span
id="fr_547"></span>[4](#fn_547.md) well acquainted with the art of making
doors, deft of hand in the work. What a splendid man <span
id="fr_548"></span>[5](#fn_548.md) that is! By my life I shall employ none
but him for such work as this. Now this knocker; dost thou observe it? I
bought it in the fancy bazaar from ‘Imrán, the curiosity dealer, for
three Mu’izzí dinars. <span id="fr_549"></span>[6](#fn_549.md) How much
brass <span id="fr_550"></span>[7](#fn_550.md) does it contain, Sir? There
are in it six pounds. It revolves on a pin in the door. I adjure thee by
God, turn it, then sound it and observe it. By the preciousness of my
life to thee, do not buy knockers except from him, for he sells only the
best.' <span id="fr_551"></span>[8](#fn_551.md) Then he knocked at the
door, we entered the vestibule <span id="fr_552"></span>[9](#fn_552.md) and
he said: 'May God prosper thee, O house! and not destroy thee, O wall!
How strong are thy walls, substantial thy superstructure, and how firm
thy foundations! By heavens! observe its staircase, the entrance and the
exit, and ask me 'How didst thou get it?

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> How many devices
didst devise before thou didst appropriate it?' I had a neighbour
surnamed Abú Suleyman, who lived in this quarter. He had of live
stock <span id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_553.md) more than enclosure could
contain, and of dead stock more than could be weighed. He died--may God
have mercy upon him!--and left a son who squandered <span
id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_554.md) it on wine and music <span
id="fr_555"></span>[3](#fn_555.md) and scattered it between
backgammon <span id="fr_556"></span>[4](#fn_556.md) and dice. I was afraid
lest excessive need should compel him to dispose of the house and he
should sell it while in a state of vexation, or expose it to ruin, in
which case I should see the chance of buying it lost, and wear myself
out with vain regrets to my dying day. So I took some stuff not in
demand, carried it to him and offered it to him, and I bargained with
him to buy it on credit; and the unfortunate one counts credit a gift,
and the promise breaker considers it a present. And I asked him for a
bond for the goods, so he granted it, and signed <span
id="fr_557"></span>[5](#fn_557.md) it in my favour. Then I pretended to be
indifferent in demanding payment till the extremities of the garment of
his state became frayed, and then I came to him and asked him to pay the
debt. He begged for time and I respited him. <span
id="fr_558"></span>[6](#fn_558.md) He next asked for some stuff besides
that; so I brought it and asked him to mortgage his house to me as a
security in my hands, and he did so. Then I gradually involved him in
bargains till it came to selling the house and it was acquired by me
through rising fortune, and helping fate, and the strength of my arm.
'*There is many a toiler for an idle sitter*, <span
id="fr_559"></span>[7](#fn_559.md) And, praise God, I am exceedingly lucky,
and in such matters worthy of commendation,

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

and this will suffice thee, Sir. For many nights I had been sleeping in
my house with those therein when lo! there was a knock at the door, I
said, 'who is the wandering nocturnal visitor?' And behold it was a
woman with a pearl necklace with a surface as clear as water, and in
fineness like unto the mirage, which she offered for sale! So I snatched
it from her with a plundering snatch and bought it for a low, price and
soon there will be derived from it a manifest gain and plentiful profit,
by the help of God, the most High, and thy good fortune. I have only
related this story to thee that thou mightest know the propitiousness of
my fortune in commerce. 'Luck brings forth water from stones.' <span
id="fr_560"></span>[1](#fn_560.md) Great God! None can inform thee more
truly than thyself and naught is nearer to thee than thy yesterday. I
bought this mat in an auction. It was taken from the house of the Furát
family <span id="fr_561"></span>[2](#fn_561.md) at the time of
sequestration and plundering. For a long time I had been seeking one
like it, but had found none. But time is pregnant and it is not known
what it will bring forth. <span id="fr_562"></span>[3](#fn_562.md) Then it
so happened I was at the Táq gate and

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

this was being offered for sale in the streets. So I weighed out for it
such and such a sum of dinars I adjure thee by God observe its fineness,
softness, workmanship, and colour, for it is of great worth. Its like is
found but rarely. If thou hast heard of Abú ‘Imrán, the mat-weaver, it
is his handiwork. And he has a son who will succeed him and who is now
in his shop. Fine mats can only be had of him. By my life! do not buy
mats except at his shop. Now the righteous man is his brethren's
counsellor, especially of him whose person is rendered inviolable by
eating at his table. Let us return to the story of the Maḍirah for
noontide has approached. 'Boy! the basin and the water!' I said 'Great
God! perhaps deliverance is nigh, and escape has become easy.' The slave
came forward. He asked: 'Dost thou see this slave, he is of Greek
origin, brought up in ‘Iráq. Step forward boy, uncover thy head, bare
thy calf, tuck up thy sleeves, expose thy teeth, advance, retire!' The
slave did so. Said the merchant: who bought him? 'By Heavens!
Abú’l-‘Abbás bought him from the slave dealer. Put down the basin <span
id="fr_563"></span>[1](#fn_563.md) and bring the ewer.' <span
id="fr_564"></span>[2](#fn_564.md) The slave put it down and the merchant
picked it up, turned it round, looked it over, sounded it and said:
'Look at this brass, <span id="fr_565"></span>[3](#fn_565.md) it seems like
a burning brand, or a piece of gold. Its brass is Syrian and it is of
‘Iráq workmanship. It is not a worn-out curio. It has known and made the
round of the palaces of kings; consider its beauty and ask me 'When
didst thou buy it?' 'I bought it, by Heavens! in the famine year and I
have preserved it for this hour. Boy, the ewer!' And he brought it. And
the merchant took it up, turned it over and said: 'The spout is of one
piece with it. This ewer is fit only for this basin, and this basin is
only suitable for this company <span id="fr_566"></span>[4](#fn_566.md) and
this company suits only this house and this house is not adorned except
by this guest. Boy! pour the water, for food time is

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

nigh. I adjure thee by God, dost thou see this water? How pure it is!
Blue as the eye of the cat, clear as a crystal wand, drawn from the
Euphrates, and it is used after standing for the night when it has
become like the flame of a torch and translucent as a tear. And the
importance is not in the water carrier, but in the vessel. Nothing
proves to thee the purity of the vessel more correctly than the purity
of the liquid. Now this napkin, ask of me its story. It is a fabric of
Jurján and a production of Arraján. It fell to my lot and I bought it.
My wife took a portion of it for drawers <span
id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_567.md) and I made some of it into a
napkin. <span id="fr_568"></span>[2](#fn_568.md) Her drawers took twenty
cubits <span id="fr_569"></span>[3](#fn_569.md) and I forcibly wrested this
much from her hand, gave it to the embroiderer <span
id="fr_570"></span>[4](#fn_570.md) to make and embroider it as thou seest
it. Then I brought it back from the market and stored it away in a box
and preserved it for refined guests. The common Arabs have not defiled
it with their hands, nor women with the corners of their eyes, for every
precious thing has its day <span id="fr_571"></span>[5](#fn_571.md) and
every instrument its people. Boy! the table! for the delay is great, and
the bowls! for the discussion has been long, and the food! for words
have been multiplied.' The slave brought the table. The merchant then
turned it over

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

sounded it with his fingers, and bit it <span
id="fr_572"></span>[1](#fn_572.md) with his teeth and said: 'May God
prosper Baghdad, how excellent are her goods and skilful her artisans!
By Heavens! observe this table, look at the breadth of its surface, the
lightness of its weight, the soundness of its timber and the beauty of
its make.' Said I: 'This is the make but when is the meal?' He answered:
'Immediately. Boy! quick, the food! But the table, its legs are a part
of it.' Said Abú’l-Fatḥ, 'My spirit boiled, <span
id="fr_573"></span>[2](#fn_573.md) and I said: 'There remaineth the baking
and its implements, the bread and its properties, the wheat and whence
the grain was first bought, and how the transport was hired for it, in
which mill it was ground and the vessel in which it was kneaded, which
oven was heated and which baker was hired; and there remaineth the wood,
whence it was gathered, when it was brought in, how it was stacked till
it was seasoned and how it was stored until it dried. Then there are
left the baker and his description, the apprentice <span
id="fr_574"></span>[3](#fn_574.md) and his qualification, the flour and its
praise, the leaven and its tale, the salt and its savour; and then there
remain, the dishes <span id="fr_575"></span>[4](#fn_575.md) and who had
them, how he procured them, who used them and who made them. Then the
vinegar, how its grapes were picked, or how its ripe dates were bought,
how its press was plastered, how the essence was extracted, how its jar
was besmeared with pitch and how much its vat is worth. Then there
remain the vegetables and the devices whereby they were picked, in which
vegetable garden they were arranged, and the skill displayed to produce
them free from impurities. Then there remaineth the Maḍirah <span
id="fr_576"></span>[5](#fn_576.md) and how its meat was bought and its
extra fat was got, how its cooking pot was set up, how its fire

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

was kindled, how its spices were pounded, till, finally, it was
well-cooked and its gravy became consistent. But this is a mighty matter
and a never-ending affair?' So I arose. He asked: 'Whither dost thou
intend to go?' I replied, 'I intend to go to discharge a need.' He
enquired: 'Sir, dost thou want a privy that makes the spring quarters of
the prince, and the autumn residence of the wazír appear contemptible?
Its top has been plastered <span id="fr_577"></span>[1](#fn_577.md) with
gypsum and its bottom with mortar, its roof has been made flat and its
floor paved with marble. The ant slips down from its wall and cannot
cling, and the fly tries to walk upon its floor but slides. It has a
door whose venetians are made alternately of teak and ivory and joined
together with an excellent joining so that the guest desires to eat in
it.' Said I: 'Eat thou from this bag, the privy was not in the
reckoning.' And I went out towards the door, quickened my pace and began
to run, while he was following me and shouting: 'Abú’l-Fatḥ! the
Maḍirah! 'And the boys thought Maḍirah was a title of mine, and took up
his cry. So out of excessive vexation I threw a stone at one of them,
but a man received it on his turban and it sank into his skull.
Therefore I was attacked with sandals, <span
id="fr_578"></span>[2](#fn_578.md) old and new, and with cuffs good and
bad; and then I was placed in prison and remained in that unfortunate
plight for two years. So I vowed not to eat Maḍirah as long as I lived.
Now ye men of Hamadhán <span id="fr_579"></span>[3](#fn_579.md) am I unjust
in this?' Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám 'So we accepted his excuse, we vowed the
same vow and said: "Long since did Maḍirah sin against the noble and
prefer the base <span id="fr_580"></span>[4](#fn_580.md) to the good."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_529"></span>[88:2](mhm30.htm#fr_529.md) *Maḍirah:* From … it
(milk) became sour or acid biting the tongue, or, as made by the Arabs,
fleshmeat cooked with pure milk that bites the tongue, until the
fleshmeat is thoroughly done, and the milk has become thick, and
sometimes they mix fresh milk with milk that has been collected in a
skin, and in this case it is the best that can be. (Lane, *Lexicon* art.
… p. 2720). It is said to have been the favourite dish of Abú Hurayrah,
the Traditionalist, and contemporary of the Prophet. For a eulogy on
Maḍirah see Mas’údí, viii. 403. For a list of the chief dishes of the
Arabs, see the Maqámát of Náṣíf al-Yázajì, p. 98. (…)

Sufyán, the first Khalífa of the House of Umayya. (A.H. 41-60) (A.D.
661-680). An allusion to the reputed gluttony of Mu‘awiya (al-Fakhri's
History, edition of Ahlwardt, p. 131) and the voluptuousness which is
said to have characterized his court. See also *Arab Proverbs*, i, 135.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[89:2](mhm30.htm#fr_533.md) … *which dazzled the

companions of al-Raqím:* See Qur’án, xviii, 8-18. What is meant by this
word the commentators cannot agree. Some will have it to be the name of
the mountain, or the valley, wherein the cave was; some say it was the
name of their dog and others, who seem to come nearest the true
signification, that it was a brass plate, or stone tablet placed near
the mouth of the cave in which the young men, the companions of the
cave, were. Baiḍáwí's *Commentary* (edited by Fleischer), p. 555. Sale,
*Translation of the Qur’án*, xviii, 217. Hamadhání certainly did not
think that al-Raqím was the name of their dog.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[90:1](mhm30.htm#fr_538.md) … *Heart's blood:*

Khallikan, i, 555.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[91:7](mhm30.htm#fr_550.md) … *Brass:* read …

<span id="fn_551"></span>[91:8](mhm30.htm#fr_551.md) … *the best:* plural

Arabicized from the Persian … and … an entrance or passage of a house,
between the outer door or gate.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[92:1](mhm30.htm#fr_553.md) … *Live stock:*
Wealth, gold or silver, primarily camels or cattle, or sheep or goats,
because most of the wealth of the Arabs of the desert consisted of

sound.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[92:2](mhm30.htm#fr_554.md) … *Squandered it:* He

<span id="fn_560"></span>[93:1](mhm30.htm#fr_560.md) *Luck brings water
from stones:* Apparently a proverbial expression. It occurs again in a
slightly modified form on p. 205 of the Text.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[93:2](mhm30.htm#fr_561.md) … *The Furát family:*
A highly distinguished family in the service of Khalífate during the
fourth century, remarkable for their official and administrative ability
for several generations. There were four brothers who rose to eminence
during the reign of Muqtadir b’illáh (A.H. 295-320) namely, Aḥmad
Abú’l-‘Abbás, ‘Abdulláh Ja‘far, Abú ‘Ísá Ibráhím, Abú’l-Ḥasan ‘Alí.
Their father was Muḥammad Ibn Músá, an agent to the Khalífa Muntaṣir
(A.H. 247).

Abú’l-Ḥasan ‘Alí, the most celebrated of the four, was three times wazír
to al-Muqtadir. He was a man of great natural gifts, an excellent
administrator, and liberal to extravagance. In A.H. 299 the Khalífa
dismissed him and seized all his vast wealth. This is the incident
Hamadhání refers to. From the time of his dismissal to his reinstatement
in 304 the income from his estates to the public treasury amounted to no
less than seven million dinars. On his reappointment in 304 the Khalífa
showed him the highest favours, sending him seven cloaks of honour and
300,000 dirhems. Two years later he was again arrested and thrown into
prison. In 311 he was restored to his post for the third time and marked
his resumption of office by acts which have left a stain on his memory.
He exacted large sums from many people and allowed his son,
Abú’l-Muḥássin, to put to death Ḥamid ibn al-‘Abbás, the late wazír. The
following year he fell for the third time, when it was found that he
possessed upwards of a million dinars, and that his landed property
produced an annual income of a million dinars. A few days later he and
his son Muḥássin were put to death by Nazuk the chief of the police.
