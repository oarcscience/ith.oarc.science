### XXXI. THE MAQAMA OF THE SPINDLE

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I entered Baṣra when I was wide
of fame and abundant of reputation, and there came to me two young men.
One of them said: 'May God strengthen the Shaikh! this youth entered our
house and seized a kitten <span id="fr_778"></span>[4](#fn_778.md) with
vertigo in its head, with the sacred cord <span
id="fr_779"></span>[5](#fn_779.md) and a whirling sphere around its middle.
Gentle of voice, if it cries; quick to return, if it flees; long of
skirt, if it pulls; slender of

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

waist, weak of chest, <span id="fr_780"></span>[1](#fn_780.md) of the size
of a plump sheep. Staying in the town, yet not abandoning travel. If it
be given a thing, it returns it. If it be tasked with a journey, it goes
energetically, and, if it is made to draw the rope, it lengthens it.
There it is, bone and wood. It contains property, immoveable and
moveable, a past and a future. <span id="fr_781"></span>[2](#fn_781.md)
Said the young man: 'Yes, may God strengthen the Shaikh! for he forcibly
took from me:--

'Pointed is his spearhead, <span id="fr_782"></span>[3](#fn_782.md) sharp
are his teeth,  
His progeny are his helpers, dissolving union is his business.  
He assails his master, clinging to his moustache;  
Inserting his fangs into old and young.  
Agreeable, of goodly shape, slim, abstemious.  
A shooter, with shafts abundant, around the beard and the moustache.'

So I said to the first: 'Give him back the comb in order that he may
return to thee the spindle.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_778"></span>[128:4](mhm39.htm#fr_778.md) … *A kitten:* The
commentator does not consider that … arabicized from the Persian …
partridge, makes good sense and says that the text is corrupt. He
suggests that the correct word is … from the Persian … a furred animal
and, as the context shows, a kitten. I think his view is correct. If we
accept as the arabicized form of … the slight error in pointing is the
kind of one a copyist might easily make.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[128:5](mhm39.htm#fr_779.md) … *Zunnar:* Greek
ζωναριον a cord or girdle worn by the Eastern Christians, the Jews,
Magi, and the Brahmins. Originally the lower girdle worn by a woman just
above the hips over which the gown was drawn and fell in folds.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[129:1](mhm39.htm#fr_780.md) *Weak of chest:*
Literally, weak in the place of the shirt. … gives no sense. Probably …
a fat sheep fit to be slaughtered.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[129:2](mhm39.htm#fr_781.md) … *Past and future:*
That is, ancestral and passing to posterity.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[129:3](mhm39.htm#fr_782.md) *Pointed is his
spearhead:* Metre, *rejez*. Cf. Ḥarírí, i, 87.
