### XXVII. THE MAQAMA OF AL-ASWAD <span id="fr_660"></span>[7](#fn_660.md)

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was suspected on account of
some property I had gotten and so I fled, I knew not whither, until I
came to a desert, and my wandering led me to the shade of a tent. I
found near the pegs thereof a youth playing in the sand with those of
his own age, and reciting a

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

poem which was in keeping with his condition but did not accord with his
powers of improvisation. <span id="fr_661"></span>[1](#fn_661.md)

And I felt it to be far from him to be able to weave its fabric, so I
said: 'Young Arab, dost thou recite or compose this poem?' He said:
'Nay, but I compose it.' Then he recited saying:--

'And verily though I be young <span id="fr_662"></span>[2](#fn_662.md)  
And the eye disdain me,  
My demon <span id="fr_663"></span>[3](#fn_663.md) is the chief of the
*Jinn*  
And he takes me through all the range of the poetic art,  
Until he drives away what occurs of doubt.  
Therefore go at thine ease and depart from me.'

I said: 'O young Arab, terror has brought me to thee. Is there,
therefore, safety or hospitality with thee?' He replied: 'Thou hast
descended in the very house of safety and alighted on the land of
hospitality.' He said: 'Then he arose and seized me by the sleeve and I
went with him to a tent whose curtains were lowered.' Then he shouted:
'O damsel of the tribe, here is a neighbour whose country has rejected
him, and whose ruler has oppressed him. Fame, which he has heard, or a
report, which has reached him, has driven him to us, so give him
shelter.' The damsel said: 'Stay, O townsman.'

'O townsman, stay and fear no ill, <span
id="fr_664"></span>[4](#fn_664.md)  
For thou art in the house of al-Aswad ibn Qinání  
The mightiest son of woman from Maa‘d and Ya‘rub,  
And the most promise-keeping of them in every place.  
The best striker with the sword among them in defence of his
neighbour,  
And the greatest smiter with the spear in protecting him.  
It is as though death and bounty were in his hand

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

Two clouds connected and combined.  
Fair of countenance of noble forehead. And, when he mentions his
pedigree,  
It goes back to illustrious Yemeni origin.  
So go to the house of refuge in which seven have alighted  
And thou wilt make them the even number eight.' <span
id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_665.md)

Then the young man took me by the hand to the house which she had
indicated. I beheld and lo! there were seven persons in it. But my eye
fastened upon none among them except Abú’l-[Fatḥ](errata.htm#6.md)
al-Iskanderí. So I said to him: 'Sirrah! in what land art thou?' He
recited:--

'I have alighted in the house of al-Aswad. <span
id="fr_666"></span>[2](#fn_666.md)  
I choose the choicest of its fruits.  
And I said I am a terrified man,  
Fear hath pursued me for her blood-wit--  
The device of the likes of me against  
The likes of him in this and like conditions--  
Until he clothed me, repairing my need,  
And removing its manifest signs.  
So take from Time and get what is pure, <span
id="fr_667"></span>[3](#fn_667.md)  
Before thou art transported from its abode.  
Beware that thou keep back no desire,  
Nor permit any milk to remain in the udders <span
id="fr_668"></span>[4](#fn_668.md) of the camels.'

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

Said ‘Ísá ibn Hishám: I exclaimed: 'Good gracious! What way of
mendicity <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_669.md) hast thou not trodden?'

Then we lived together in that abode for a season until we were safe
from danger, and then he fared eastwards and I westwards.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[110:7](mhm35.htm#fr_660.md) *Al-Aswad ibn Qinán:*
A famous Bedawín Shaikh. He belonged to the family … of whom an account
is given by Ibn Duraid in his *Kitáb al-Ishtíqáq*, p. 240.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[111:1](mhm35.htm#fr_661.md) *Did not accord with
his powers of improvisation:* That is, his powers of improvisation were
greater than could be expected of a youth of his age.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[111:2](mhm35.htm#fr_662.md) *And verily though I
be young:* Metre, *rejez*. This poem is quoted by Jáḥiz. See Jáḥiz,
*Ḥaywán*, i, 146, and Letters of Abú’l ‘Ala al-Ma‘arrí, p. 66, line 22.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[111:3](mhm35.htm#fr_663.md) *My demon:* (my
muse). The ancient Arabs believed that the poet was in league with
spirits (Jinn), or satans and that he derived his inspiration and
supernatural powers from them. Cf. Qur’án, xxvi, 224-6 on the poets;
also, Letters of Abú’l ‘Alá al-Ma‘arrí, pp. 66, 73-4.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[111:4](mhm35.htm#fr_664.md) *O townsman, stay:*
Metre, *tawíl*.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[112:1](mhm35.htm#fr_665.md) … *Thou wilt make
them the even number eight:*--

\(1\) from … he made it an even number or pair.

\(2\) … he made it an odd number.

Example: …

'The people were an odd number and I made them an even number; and they
were an even number and I made them an odd number.' Cf. Qur’án, lxxxix,
2. (…) 'By that which is double and that which is single', and *Aghání*,
iv, 176, line 20.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[112:2](mhm35.htm#fr_666.md) *I have alighted in
the house:* Metre, sari.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[112:3](mhm35.htm#fr_667.md) … *So take what is
pure:* Cf. Text p. 135.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[112:4](mhm35.htm#fr_668.md) *Nor permit any milk
to remain in the udders:* … A small quantity of milk in the udder. …
plural of … milk remaining in the udder. … throwing cold water upon a
camel's udder to make her return or increase her milk. Therefore the
literal meaning is to wet the camel's udder with what should remain
<span id="page_113">p. 113</span> therein. A figure for improvidence, or
indifference to the needs of the future. There is a tradition of the
Prophet: … 'Leave in the udder what will induce the milk flow.'

<span id="fn_669"></span>[113:1](mhm35.htm#fr_669.md) *Mendicity:* I have
read … mendicity being more consistent with the context and the word
other editions give preference to, instead of … disagreeable.
