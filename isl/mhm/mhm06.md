The Maqámát of Badí‘ al-Zamán al-Hamadhání, tr. W.J. Prendergast
\[1915\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### III. THE WORD MAQAMA (…)

MAQAMA, plural Maqámát, from … he stood, primarily signifies an occasion
of standing, or a place where one stands upright. Standing appear to
have been not only the natural, but the conventional position of the
speaker, e.g.

\(1\) …  
    The people stood up to speak. <span id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60.md)

\(2\) I have heard that ‘Alí ibn al-Ḥusain was standing admonishing the
people. <span id="fr_61"></span>[3](#fn_61.md)

\(3\) Come near and eat, or, if thou wilt, stand and speak. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[4](#fn_62.md)

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

The practice of standing to speak goes back to Homeric times:--

O Damaan, friends and heroes, men of Arie's company, seemly it is to
listen to him who standeth to speak. <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md)

According to Ibn Qutaiba (A. H. 276) reports of the literary discussions
held in the assemblies of men of learning and culture received, early in
the ‘Abbásid period (A. H. 132-656), the name Maqáma. <span
id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md)

These literary reunions appear to have been a recognized institution.
Saif al-Daula used to hold an assembly every night to which men of
learning came and conversed in his presence; <span
id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_65.md) and Tha‘álibí, in referring to the
literary splendour of Bukhára in Hamadhání's time, mentions a remarkable
gathering of the chief scholars of the day at the Court of that
State. <span id="fr_66"></span>[4](#fn_66.md)

Maqáma probably acquired the more restricted meaning of a discourse,
exhortation or oration, between the time of Jáḥiz (ob. A.H. 255) and
that of Hamadhání (ob. A.H. 398).

The extracts given below illustrate the various uses of the word from
the time of the pre-Islámic poet Zuheir (end of the sixth century A.D.)
to that of the author (end of the eleventh century A.D.) It is thus used
by early writers:--

\(1\) By Zuheir and quoted by Hamadhání:--

…  
And among them are *maqámát*--champions and the like--whose faces are
fair,  
And councils where words are followed by deeds. <span
id="fr_67"></span>[5](#fn_67.md)

\(2\) By Abú Tammám (ob. A.H. 190):--

…  
Concerning every battlefield and in every *maqáma* (situation);  
Which obtain from poetry covenants and contracts. <span
id="fr_68"></span>[6](#fn_68.md)

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

…  
Of many a *maqáma*--speech--whose weapons have rendered other people's
talk weak, wherein there are waves of language which cannot be cleared
away,  
Hast thou dispelled the: darkness with a decisive speech like unto a
determining blow in the time of peril. <span
id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md)

…  
And if he is present in the *maqáma*--assembly or council--on the day of
final decision,  
Thou wilt see the equal of Luqmán the sage. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70.md)

\(3\) By al-Qattál:--

…  
In the presence of the *maqáma*--a company of people--I adjured Zíád to
desist,  
And I reminded him of the ties of relationship of Sa‘r and Haitham that
bound us together. <span id="fr_71"></span>[3](#fn_71.md)

\(4\) By Jáḥiz (ob. A. H. 255):--

…  
And he sat down and the company were Arabs who were discussing tradition
and citing proof passages and proverbs, and from history, battles and
*maqámát*--speeches or orations. <span id="fr_72"></span>[4](#fn_72.md)

…  
Solitary ones who have not heard the barking of the dogs of *maqáma*--a
company of Bedawín. <span id="fr_73"></span>[5](#fn_73.md)

\(5\) By Abú ‘Alí al-Qálí (ob. 356):--

 <span id="fr_74"></span>[6](#fn_74.md) …  
Maqáma = Majlis, a company of people.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

\(6\) By Hamadhání:--

…  
There used to reach me of the *maqámát*--discourses and the like--and
sayings of al-Iskanderí. <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md)

…  
So wait for the end of his *maqáma*--a discourse. The word here refers
to a stirring sermon which ‘Ísá ibn Hishám had been listening to. <span
id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76.md)

…  
And him who enters the *maqámát*--companies or assemblies of respectable
people. <span id="fr_77"></span>[3](#fn_77.md)

…  
And of their distinguishing marks is the vileness of their
*maqámát*--assemblies of chief men, or speeches. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[4](#fn_78.md)

…  
Verily he who has dictated four hundred *maqámát* on mendicity. <span
id="fr_79"></span>[5](#fn_79.md)

Although the maqámát were composed chiefly for assemblies of the learned
and for the entertainment of the great, the word maqáma is applied by
Hamadhání himself to the species of composition first associated with
his name, and not to the people who assembled to listen to his
discourses. It is in this restricted sense that it has come down to us.

As the extracts from different authors do, however, show that the word
has the triple signification of an oratorical address or harangue, a
collection of champions, or a company of people, I have preferred a
transliteration to the rendering by the familiar, but unsatisfactory,
term assembly.
