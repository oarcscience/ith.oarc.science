<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: There used to reach me of the maq&aacute;m&aacute;t and sayings of al-Iskander&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> such as would arrest the fugitive and agitate the sparrow.

<p>and fortune. Fortune had made her benefits&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> remote by placing barriers between him and them and continued so to do till I happened to have some business in &#7716;im&#7779;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> So I sharpened my greediness of desire to go thither in the company of some individuals, brilliant as the stars of night, and like saddle-cloths cleaving to the backs of the horses. We started on the road eliminating its distance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and annihilating its space, and we continued to traverse the humps of the uplands, mounted upon those noble steeds, until they became as lean as walking-sticks and were bent like bows. Now we were fated to pass a valley along the base of a mountain covered with ala and tamarisk thickets which looked like maidens with their flowing tresses and suspended locks.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> The fierce noonday heat turned us thither to seek a sheltered spot and a midday nap. We had tethered our horses and had addressed ourselves to sleep with the sleepers, when suddenly the neighing of the horses startled us. And I looked towards my steed and behold he had cocked his ears, he was glaring with his eyes, gnawing the strands of the rope with his lips, and scoring the surface of the ground with his hoofs. Then the horses stampeded,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> staled, broke the ropes and made for the mountains. Every one of us flew to his weapons when lo! there appeared a lion, in the garb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> of doom, ascending from his lair, with inflated skin,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> showing his teeth, with an eye full of arrogance, a nose distended with pride, and a breast from which courage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> never departed and wherein terror never dwelt. We said: 'This is a serious matter and an anxious business.' There advanced to meet him from among the impetuous of the party a youth,</p>

<p><DIR>'Tawny of skin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the family that comprises the nobility of the Arabs,<br> Who fills his bucket full to the knot of the rope that ties the middle of the cross-bars,'</DIR></p>  
<p>with a heart urged on by doom, and an all-effective sword, but the fierceness of the lion took possession of him and the ground cheated his feet so that he fell on his hands and face. The lion then crossed over the place of his falling in the direction of those who were with him. Then death summoned the fallen one's fellow in the same manner. He advanced, but terror tied his hands, he fell to the earth and the lion crouched&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on his chest. But I threw my turban at him and diverted his mouth and thus prevented the shedding of the youth's blood. Then the young man arose and slashed at his stomach until he collapsed with fright and the lion died of the wounds in his stomach. We then went after the horses, found such as had halted, abandoned such as had bolted, and returned to the dead friend to perform the last rites! 'When we had poured the earth upon our <i>late</i> fellow-traveller we were grieved, aye and what an hour of grief it was.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Then we turned again towards the desert and entered it. We journeyed on till the provision bag contracted and supplies were well nigh exhausted. We could neither advance nor retreat, and we dreaded the two slayers, thirst and hunger, when a horseman came in sight. We went towards him and moved</p>

<p>in his direction. When we reached him, he alighted from his noble steed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> kissed the ground&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and prostrated himself.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> He then came towards me, to the exclusion of the company, kissed my stirrup and sought shelter at my side. I beheld and lo! a face that shone like the sheen of the rain-cloud, and a goodly stature,</p>  
<p><DIR>'When the beholder's eye ascends&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to, his head and descends to his feet,<br> It is unable to take in all his beauties,'</DIR></p>  
<p>a cheek upon which the down had appeared and a moustache that had just sprouted; a plump forearm, a supple and slim body.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> His origin was Turkish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and his dress royal.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> We said: 'Perish thy father!'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> What has happened to thee?</p>  
<p>He replied: 'I am the servant of a king who made a determined attempt to kill me, and so I ran away, I knew not whither, as you see me now.' Now his appearance bore witness to the truth of his statement. Then he said: 'To-day I am thy servant and what is mine is thine!' I said, 'Good tidings for both of us. Thy journey has brought thee to a spacious court and fresh delight.' The company congratulated me, and</p>

<p>he began to look and his glances smote us; he commenced to speak and his words fascinated us. He said: 'O masters! at the base of this mountain there is a spring and ye have entered a waterless desert,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> so take some water from there.' So we turned rein in the direction he indicated and we arrived there. The noonday heat had melted our bodies and the locusts had mounted the trees.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> He said: 'Will you not take the noonday nap beneath this spacious shade, and near this fresh water?' We said: 'As thou wilt.' He then dismounted from his horse, undid his belt, removed his tunic&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> so that nothing concealed him from us, except a thin undergarment which did but reveal his body. We doubted not but that he had quarrelled with the ministering angels,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> evaded the heavenly guards, and fled from the guardian of Paradise. He betook himself to the saddles and removed them, to the horses and fed them,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and to the resting-places and sprinkled them with water. Men's perception was bewildered at him, and their eyes were fixed upon him. So I said: 'O young man, how courteous thou art in service and how generally useful! Therefore woe to him whom thou hast forsaken, and blessed is he with whom thou hast become friendly! How is it possible to thank God for His favour through thee?' He said: 'That which you will soon see from me will be even greater. Do my activity in service and my general comeliness please you? What if ye were to see me in company, showing some portion of my skill? It would increase your admiration&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> for me.' We said: 'Go on!' Then he took one of our bows, strung it, braced the bow-string, put it into the notch, and shot it up towards the sky and then</p>

<p>followed it up with another and split it in the air. Then he said: 'I will show you another trick.' He then made for my quiver and seized it, went towards my horse and mounted it, and shot one of our number with an arrow which he fixed in his chest, and then a second one which he shot through his back. I cried out 'Sirrah! what art thou doing?' He retorted 'Silence, scoundrel! By heavens, every one of you shall bind his fellow's hands, or I will make his spittle to choke him.' Nov with our horses tied up, our saddles off, our arms beyond our reach, he mounted and we on foot, his bow in his hand ready to shoot us in the back, or to pierce our abdomens and chests, we were at a loss what to do. But, when we saw his seriousness, we seized the thong and bound one another. I alone remained with no one to tie my hands. So he said to me: 'Strip!'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and I stripped. Then he got down from the horse and began to slap each of us, one after the other, and to take off his clothes, and finally he came to me. Now I had on a pair of new boots and so he said to me: 'Perish thy mother! take them off' I replied: 'I put these boots on when the hide was raw and, therefore, I cannot remove them.' He said: 'I will take them off.' Then he drew near to me to remove them, and I stretched my hand to seize a knife which I had concealed in one boot while he was engaged removing the other. I plunged the knife into his abdomen with such force, that I caused it to appear behind his back, and he uttered but one cry&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and then bit the dust.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Then I arose, went to my companions and untied their hands. And we then divided the spoils&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_251"></A><A HREF="#fn_251"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> obtained from the two dead men. We found our friend had given up the ghost and so we buried him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_252"></A><A HREF="#fn_252"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Then we continued our journey and arrived at &#7716;im&#7779; after five nights' travelling. Now when we reached an open space in the market, we saw a man with a wallet and a small walking-stick in his hand, standing in front of his son and little daughter, and he was saying:--</p>

<p><DIR>'God bless him who fills my wallet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_253"></A><A HREF="#fn_253"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with his generous gifts,<br> God bless him who is moved to pity for Sa&#8217;&iacute;d and Fatimah,<br> Verily he will be your male-servant and she your maid-servant.'</DIR></p>  
<p>Said &#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m: This man is surely al-Iskander&iacute; of whom I have heard, and regarding whom I have been asking; and behold it was he!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_254"></A><A HREF="#fn_254"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> So I gently approached him and said: 'Command what is thine.' He replied: 'A dirhem.' I said:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'Thou canst have a dirhem&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_255"></A><A HREF="#fn_255"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> multiplied by its like<br> As long as I live.<br> So make up thy account and ask<br> In order that I may give what is demanded.'</DIR></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> And I said to him: 'A dinar into two, into three, into four, into five, until I reached twenty.' Then I said: 'How much dost thou make it?' He answered: 'twenty loaves.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> So I commanded that amount to be given him and said: 'Nought avails without God's help&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and there is no device against ill-fatedness.'</p>

This phrase would call to mind the dispute originated by Sibawayh, the greatest of grammarians, in the time of the Khal&iacute;fa H&aacute;r&uacute;n al-Rashid (Yaq&uacute;t, <i>Dictionary of Learned Men</i>, vi, 83). Cf. English, It is me, and the French, <i>c&#8217;est moi</i>.</P>
