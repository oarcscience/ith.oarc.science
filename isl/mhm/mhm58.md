### L. THE MAQAMA OF THE QUEST

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: One day I joined a company like
unto the flowers of spring, or the stars of night after the third watch,
with bright countenances and agreeable dispositions. They resembled one
another in appearance and were alike in good circumstances. And we began
to pull the skirts of conversation and to open the doors of debate. Now
there was in our midst a youth, short of stature among men, with clipped
mustachios, who uttered not a word, nor entered with us into a
description, until, finally, the discussion led us to the praise of
wealth and its possessors, to the mention of property and its excellence
and to the assertion that it is the adornment of men and the goal of
perfection. Then, as if he had awoke from a sleep, or presented himself
after an absence, he opened his *díwán*, <span
id="fr_1074"></span>[4](#fn_1074.md) loosed his tongue, and said: 'Silence!
Verily ye have failed in a thing that ye lack; ye have come short in the
search of it and

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

then despised it. Ye have been cheated out of the eternal by the
temporal, and the near <span id="fr_1075"></span>[1](#fn_1075.md) has
preoccupied you to the exclusion of the remote. <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[2](#fn_1076.md) Is the world other than the
camping-ground of a camel-rider, or the hasty meal of the wayfarer? Is
wealth aught but a loan to be returned, or a trust to be given up? It is
transferred from one people to another, and those who come first hoard
it for those who come after. Do ye see wealth with any but the niggards,
to the exclusion of the generous? or with the ignorant, to the exclusion
of the learned? Beware of delusion, for there is no glory except in one
of two directions, and no precedence save in one of two lots, noble
pedigree or eminent learning. And how excellent a thing is that whose
bearer is borne on people's heads, and whose aspirant despaireth not! By
heavens! were it not for the preservation of life and honour, I should
have been the richest man on earth. For I know of two treasures, one of
them is in the region of Ṭarsus <span id="fr_1077"></span>[3](#fn_1077.md)
and men's minds crave for it. It belongs to the treasures of the
Amalekites and to the stores of the Patricians. <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[4](#fn_1078.md) There are in it a hundred thousand
pounds weight. As for the other, it is between Sora <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[5](#fn_1079.md) and Hilleh. <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[6](#fn_1080.md) It contains of the treasures of the
Persian

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

kings <span id="fr_1081"></span>[1](#fn_1081.md) and of the hoards of the
Tyrants sufficient for mankind and Jinn. Most of it consists of red
rubies, pearls and gems, bejewelled crowns and ten thousand talents
amassed.' Now when we heard that, we carne before him, leaned towards
him, and began to consider his judgement weak in being content with a
scanty livelihood in spite of his being aware of these stores. Then he
hinted that he was afraid of the Sulṭán and relied upon none of his
brethren. So we said: 'We have heard thy argument and we accept thy
excuse. Now, if thou wouldst see fit to do us a kindness, to oblige us,
and to acquaint us with one of these treasures, on condition that
two-thirds shall be thine, do so.' Then he extended his hand towards us
and said: 'He who sends something in advance will find it again, and to
him who knows what is obtainable the bountiful giving of money is easy.'
So each one of us gave him what was ready to hand and was eager for what
he had mentioned. Now, when we had filled his palm, he raised his eyes
towards us and said: 'We must get a bare sufficiency <span
id="fr_1082"></span>[2](#fn_1082.md) of the means of subsistence and obtain
what will maintain strength. <span id="fr_1083"></span>[3](#fn_1083.md) Our
time is short and, if God will, exalted be He! the meeting-place will be
here to-morrow.'

Said ‘Isá ibn Hishám: When that company dispersed, I sat after them for
a while. Then I advanced towards him and seated myself before him and
said--and verily I desired to make his acquaintance and my soul longed
to converse with him: 'It is as though I knew thy pedigree and had met
thee.' He said: 'Yes, a road united us and thou wast my
travelling-companion.' So I said: 'Time hath changed thee to me and none
made me forget thee except Satan.' <span
id="fr_1084"></span>[4](#fn_1084.md)

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

Then he recited saying:--

'I am the tyrant of the time, <span id="fr_1085"></span>[1](#fn_1085.md) of
folly I have many ideas  
And, when money faileth, I spend from the purse of desires.  
Whoever desires greedy feeding and deep drinking, to the sound <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[2](#fn_1086.md) of the lute, <span
id="fr_1087"></span>[3](#fn_1087.md)  
And prefers the smooth-faced, oblivious of so and so, and so and so,  
Thou wilt see him secure against wealth and prosperity.'

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[183:3](mhm58.htm#fr_1077.md) … *Tarsus:* A
well-known ancient city in the fertile plain of Cilicia. It was captured
by the Arabs shortly after A.D. 660. For more than a century after its
conquest it was in ruins. But Hárún al-Rashíd rebuilt its wall in A.D.
787 and made it the north-western capital of the Arab power in the long
wars against the Byzantine empire. The Khalífa Mamúm died and was buried
here in A.H. 218 (August A.D. 833). The ruins of the ancient city are
extensive but are deeply buried. (*Encyclopædia Britannica*, xxvi, 433).
The assertion that a treasure lay buried here was, therefore, not
inappropriate.

<span id="fn_1078"></span>[183:4](mhm58.htm#fr_1078.md) … *Patricians:*
Plural of … leader of an army, one who is over ten thousand men. It is
arabicized from the Latin patricius. From the time of Constantine (A.D.
288-337) patrician became the title of a person high in office at court.

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[183:5](mhm58.htm#fr_1079.md) *Sora:* In
Babylonia quite close to Hilleh and Waqf, the seat of a famous Jewish
academy founded in the third century A.D. by the renowned scholar Abba
Arika, which played a dominant rôle in Babylonian Judaism for several
centuries. It was noted for wine. *Jewish Encyclopædia*, i, 145, and
Yaqút, iii, 184.

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[183:6](mhm58.htm#fr_1080.md) … *Hilleh:* of Banú

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span> of them bearing an inscription of
Nebuchadnezzar, obtained from the ruins of Babylon which lie less than
an hour away to the north. *Encyclopædia Britannica*, xiii, 467; and
Yaqút, ii, 10 and 322.

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[184:1](mhm58.htm#fr_1081.md) … *The treasures of
the Persian Kings:* The royal treasures which fell into the hands of the
Arabs on the overthrow of the Persian monarchy in the Khalífate of ‘Umar
(A.D. 634-44) were enormous; see al-Fakhrí, p. 101. The term,
consequently, came to be synonymous with immense wealth. Cf. Persian

sufficiency:* Literally, that suffices the cattle of what they obtain
from trees or plants; hence food sufficient to maintain life.
