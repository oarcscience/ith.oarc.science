### II. THE MAQAMA OF THE DATE

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was in Baghdad at the time of
the azaz date harvest, so I went out to select and buy some of the
different kinds of it. I proceeded a short distance to a man who had got
a stock of various sorts of fruit which he had arranged in order. He had
collected and placed in rows a variety of fresh dates and I took some of
the best of everything and picked <span id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152.md)
some of the finest of every species. Now just as I had gathered up my
skirts and placed my load in them, my eyes fell upon a man who had
modestly covered his face with a veil <span
id="fr_153"></span>[2](#fn_153.md) and was standing still with outstretched
hand. He had his little ones by his side and bore his babes on his hip,
while he recited in a voice so loud that it weakened his chest and
produced feebleness in his spine:--

'Alas! I have neither two handfuls of Sawíq, <span
id="fr_154"></span>[3](#fn_154.md)  
Nor melted fat mixed with flour,  
Nor spacious bowl filled with Khirdíq, <span
id="fr_155"></span>[4](#fn_155.md)  
To soothe our palate, <span id="fr_156"></span>[5](#fn_156.md)  
And to remove us from the path of beggary.  
O Giver of plenty after poverty!  
Make it easy for some brave and liberal man  
Of pedigree and hereditary glory,  
To guide to us the feet of fortune  
And release my life from the grip of trouble.'

‘Ísá ibn Hishám said: I took from my purse a handful and gave it to him.
Then he said:--

O the one who hath bestowed <span id="fr_157"></span>[6](#fn_157.md) upon
me his excellent kindness!  
To God do I communicate his glorious secret,  
And I pray God to keep him well-guarded,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

If I have not the ability to thank him,  
Then God, my Lord, will surely recompense him.' <span
id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_158.md)

‘Ísá ibn Hishám said: So I said to him, 'There is something left in the
purse, therefore disclose thy hidden condition and I will give thee
all.' Then he removed his veil, <span id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_159.md)
and to by Heavens! it was our Shaikh, Abú’l-Fatḥ al-Iskánderí! So I
exclaimed: 'Mercy on thee, how astute thou art!' Then he recited:--

'Spend thy life in deceiving <span id="fr_160"></span>[3](#fn_160.md)  
Men and throwing dust in their eyes.  
I observe the days continue not  
In one state and therefore I imitate them.  
One day I feel their mischief,  
And another they feel mine.'
