<p>&#8216;&Iacute;S&Aacute; IBN HISH&Aacute;M related to us and said: I was in Baghdad at the time of the azaz date harvest, so I went out to select and buy some of the different kinds of it. I proceeded a short distance to a man who had got a stock of various sorts of fruit which he had arranged in order. He had collected and placed in rows a variety of fresh dates and I took some of the best of everything and picked&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> some of the finest of every species. Now just as I had gathered up my skirts and placed my load in them, my eyes fell upon a man who had modestly covered his face with a veil&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and was standing still with outstretched hand. He had his little ones by his side and bore his babes on his hip, while he recited in a voice so loud that it weakened his chest and produced feebleness in his spine:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'Alas! I have neither two handfuls of Saw&iacute;q,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> Nor melted fat mixed with flour,<br> Nor spacious bowl filled with Khird&iacute;q,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><br> To soothe our palate,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><br> And to remove us from the path of beggary.<br> O Giver of plenty after poverty!<br> Make it easy for some brave and liberal man<br> Of pedigree and hereditary glory,<br> To guide to us the feet of fortune<br> And release my life from the grip of trouble.'</DIR></p>  
<p>&#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m said: I took from my purse a handful and gave it to him. Then he said:--</p>  
<p><DIR>O the one who hath bestowed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> upon me his excellent kindness!<br> To God do I communicate his glorious secret,<br> And I pray God to keep him well-guarded,</DIR></p>

<p>&#8216;&Iacute;s&aacute; ibn Hish&aacute;m said: So I said to him, 'There is something left in the purse, therefore disclose thy hidden condition and I will give thee all.' Then he removed his veil,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and to by Heavens! it was our Shaikh, Ab&uacute;&#8217;l-Fat&#7717; al-Isk&aacute;nder&iacute;! So I exclaimed: 'Mercy on thee, how astute thou art!' Then he recited:--</p>  
<p><DIR>'Spend thy life in deceiving&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A><br> Men and throwing dust in their eyes.<br> I observe the days continue not<br> In one state and therefore I imitate them.<br> One day I feel their mischief,<br> And another they feel mine.'</DIR></p>
