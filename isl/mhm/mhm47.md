### XXXIX. THE MAQAMA OF NISHAPUR

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was at Nishapur <span
id="fr_901"></span>[2](#fn_901.md) on a Friday so I presented myself at the
*obligatory*. <span id="fr_902"></span>[3](#fn_902.md) When I had performed
it there passed by me a man who had donned a tall hat and turned a
portion of his turban beneath his chin <span
id="fr_903"></span>[4](#fn_903.md) like the Sunni's. So I asked the
worshipper at my side, 'Who is this?' He said: 'This is a moth that
attacks none but the woollen garment of the orphans, a locust that falls
upon none but the forbidden crop, a burglar that breaks into <span
id="fr_904"></span>[5](#fn_904.md) none but the treasury of pious bequests,
a Kurd that raids upon none but the weak, a wolf that preys upon none
but God's servants, between their kneeling and prostration, a warrior
that plunders nothing but God's property, under cover of covenants and
witnesses. He has donned his tall hat but doffed his piety; he has
conventionally put on his cloak but perverted the use of his, hand

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

and tongue; he has clipped short his moustache <span
id="fr_905"></span>[1](#fn_905.md) but lengthened his snares; he has
displayed his vehement eloquence, <span id="fr_906"></span>[2](#fn_906.md)
but covered up his defects; he has whitened his beard, <span
id="fr_907"></span>[3](#fn_907.md) but blackened his record; he has paraded
his abstinence, but concealed his greed.' I said: 'May God curse the
fellow! but who art thou?' He replied: 'I am a man known as
al-Iskanderí.' I said: 'May God bless the land <span
id="fr_908"></span>[4](#fn_908.md) that grew this excellence, and the
father that left this progeny, and, where art thou going?' He answered,
'To the Ka‘ba.' So I said: 'Excellent! Excellent! is its feast, though
still unprepared! We are, in that case, fellow-travellers.' He said:
'How is that, when I am going up and thou art going down?' I asked: 'How
canst thou go *up* to the Ka‘ba?' He replied: 'But I am going to the
Ka‘ba of the needy, not to the Ka‘ba of the pilgrims, to the station of
generosity not the station of sanctity, <span
id="fr_909"></span>[5](#fn_909.md) to the house of captives, <span
id="fr_910"></span>[6](#fn_910.md) not to the house of sacrifices, to the
source of gifts, <span id="fr_911"></span>[7](#fn_911.md) not the
Qibla <span id="fr_912"></span>[8](#fn_912.md) of prayer, to the
desire <span id="fr_913"></span>[9](#fn_913.md) of guests, not to the Mina
of Khaif.' <span id="fr_914"></span>[10](#fn_914.md) I asked: 'And where
are these excellences?' Then he indited saying:--

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

'Where are the Faith and the king <span id="fr_915"></span>[1](#fn_915.md)
strengthened with might,  
Through whom the cheek of noble deeds is dyed rosy red.  
In a land where hopes flourish,  
For Khalaf ibn Aḥmad is its rain-cloud.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_901"></span>[150:2](mhm47.htm#fr_901.md) Nishapur
(*Naisabur*): A well-known town, the capital of the province of the same
name, situated forty-nine miles west of Meshed. It was captured by the
Arabs in A.H. 31. Yaqút in his *Geographical Dictionary*, iv, 757,
referring to this place says of all the cities he had visited Naisabur
(Nishapur) was the finest. It was in this city, says Tha‘alibi
(*Yatima*, iv, 168) that Hamadhání wrote his four hundred maqámát and
vanquished his great literary rival the renowned Abú Bakr al-Khwárazmí.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[150:3](mhm47.htm#fr_902.md) *The obligatory:* See
Qur’án, lxii, 9, which commands attendance at congregational worship on
Fridays.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[150:4](mhm47.htm#fr_903.md) *Turned a portion of
his turban beneath the chin:* Ibn al-Athír refers to a tradition of the
prophet wherein the people were commanded to tie the extremity of the
turban under the chin and were forbidden to do otherwise. (Niháyah under
…)

<span id="fn_904"></span>[150:5](mhm47.htm#fr_904.md) … *Breaks into:*
Literally, bores.

<span id="fn_905"></span>[151:1](mhm47.htm#fr_905.md) … *Clipped short his
moustache:* Still regarded as an outward mark of piety.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[151:2](mhm47.htm#fr_906.md) … *His vehement
eloquence:* From … he (a camel) brayed in his shiq-shiqa, or faucial
bag. The primary meaning is loudness of voice and then vehement
eloquence. Shiqshiqa is also the name of a sermon preached by ‘Alí and
interrupted by a member of the congregation, a man from ‘Iráq, handing
him a letter. When desired by Ibn ‘Abbás to continue his address, ‘Alí
answered: 'Alas! Ibn ‘Abbás, the Shiqshiqa has roared and subsided',
meaning that the inspiration of the moment had gone. \[*Nahaj*
*al-Balágha*, p. 26 (Beyrut ed. A.H. 1308)\]. The saying became
proverbial. See Freytag, *Arab Proverbs*, i, 673.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[151:3](mhm47.htm#fr_907.md) *Whitened his beard:*
To give himself a venerable appearance.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[151:4](mhm47.htm#fr_908.md) … *God bless the
land!:* Literally, may God water the land!

<span id="fn_909"></span>[151:5](mhm47.htm#fr_909.md) … *The station of
sanctity:* That is, Muzdalifa.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[151:6](mhm47.htm#fr_910.md) … *The house of
captives:* The spoils of his victorious campaigns.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[151:7](mhm47.htm#fr_911.md) … *Gifts and prayer:*
See De Sacy, *Ḥarírí*, i, 18 for a similar play on these words.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[151:8](mhm47.htm#fr_912.md) *Qibla:* That part of
the horizon, or of a mosque, which is in the direction of Mecca towards
which Muslims turn to say their prayers.

<span id="fn_913"></span>[151:9](mhm47.htm#fr_913.md) *Desire:* Text, p.
201, line 5, for … read ….

<span id="fn_914"></span>[151:10](mhm47.htm#fr_914.md) *Mina al-Khaif:* A
small town near Mecca, to which the pilgrims descend on the morning of
the ‘Id.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[152:1](mhm47.htm#fr_915.md) *Where are the Faith
and the king:* Metre, *wafir*. These expressions regarding the two
Ka‘bas will be found in No. 38, page 101, of Hamadhání's Letters. They
are cited by Tha‘álibí (*Yatíma* iv, 176) as a specimen of Hamadhání's
elegant epistolary style. They are also quoted by Ibn Khallikan, 113.
Their chief merit consists of a mere play on words impossible to
preserve in a rendering into English. For similar and additional
criticisms of the Qáḍí and a description of what a Qáḍí should be, see
the Author's Letters, pp. 168-9.
