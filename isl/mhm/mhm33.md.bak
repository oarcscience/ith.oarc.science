### XXV. THE MAQAMA OF THE FAMINE

‘ÍSÁ IBN HISHÁM related to us and said: I was in Baghdad in a famine
year, <span id="fr_618"></span>[4](#fn_618.md) and so I approached a
company, united  <span id="fr_619"></span>[5](#fn_619.md) like the
Pleiades, in order to ask something of them. Now there was among them a
youth with a lisp in his tongue and a space between his front teeth. He
asked: 'What is thy affair?' <span id="fr_620"></span>[6](#fn_620.md) I
replied: 'Two conditions in which a man prospers not: that of a beggar
harassed by hunger, and that of an exile to whom return is impossible.'
The boy then said: 'Which of the two breaches dost thou wish stopped
first?' I answered: 'Hunger, for it has become extreme with me.' He
said: 'What sayest thou to a white cake on a clean table, picked herbs
with very sour vinegar, fine date-wine with pungent mustard, roast meat
ranged on a skewer with a little salt, placed now before thee by one who
will not put thee off with a promise nor torture thee with delay, and
who will afterwards follow it up <span id="fr_621"></span>[7](#fn_621.md)
with golden goblets of the juice of the grape? Is that preferable to
thee, or a large company, full cups, variety of dessert, spread carpets,
brilliant lights, and a skilful minstrel with the eye and neck of a
gazelle?

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'If thou desirest
neither this nor that, what is thy verdict regarding fresh meat, river
fish, fried brinjal, <span id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_622.md) the wine of
Quṭrubbul <span id="fr_623"></span>[2](#fn_623.md) picked apples, <span
id="fr_624"></span>[3](#fn_624.md) a soft bed on a lofty place, opposite a
rapid river, a gushing fountain, and a garden with streams in it?' ‘Ísá
ibn Hishám related: So I said: 'I am the slave of all three.' The boy
said: 'And so am I their servant, if they were only present.' I then
said: 'May God not bless thee! Thou hast revived desires which despair
had destroyed, and now thou hast gripped their palate. <span
id="fr_625"></span>[4](#fn_625.md) From which ruins dost thou hail?' He
said:--

'I am of the citizens of Alexandria, <span
id="fr_626"></span>[5](#fn_626.md)  
Of sound and pure stock among them.  
The age and the people thereof are stupid,  
Therefore I made my stupidity my steed!'
