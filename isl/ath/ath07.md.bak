### CHAPTER V

### THE MU‘TAZILITES

When the Aristotelian philosophy was first made known to the Muslim
world it was received almost as a revelation supplementing the Qur’an.
At that time it was very imperfectly understood and the discrepancies
between it and orthodox theology were not perceived. Thus the Qur’an and
Aristotle were read together and regarded as supplementing one another
in perfect good faith, but inevitably the conclusions, and still more
perhaps the methods, of Greek philosophy began to act as a powerful
solvent on the traditional beliefs.

Maqrizi refers to the Mu‘tazilites as seizing with avidity on the books
of the philosophers, and certainly now new difficulties begin to appear
as well as the two great problems which had been prominent at the
beginning of the second century—the eternity of the Qur’an and the
question of free will. The new difficulties were especially concerned
with the qualities of God and, later, with the Qur’anic promise of the
beatific vision. The problem of the qualities of God is very closely
parallel to the earlier difficulty as to the eternity of the Qur’an,
indeed it appears as an enlargement of it. Christian theologians
educated in

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

the methods of Greek philosophy had already debated this matter, and in
their hands it had taken the form of the question, "how many, and what,
attributes are compatible with the unity of God?" If God's wisdom,
whether expressed in the Qur’an or not expressed, were eternal there was
something which God possessed, and consequently something other than God
which was equal to him in eternity and was not created by him, so that
it could not be said that God was alone and that all other things
proceeded from him as their cause as the eternal quality always was side
by side with God, and so Wasil b. ‘Ata declared "he who affirms an
eternal quality beside God, affirms two gods." But this applies equally
to all qualities, justice, mercy, etc., and, as was suggested by the
study of Aristotle, all the categories, all that could be predicated of
God as subject, were either created by God and so were not essential and
eternal attributes, or else were external things equal with God.

The second generation of Mu‘tazilites, of those who begin to show direct
acquaintance with Greek philosophy, begins with *Abu l-Hudayl al- Allaf*
of Basra (d. 226 A.H.), who lived at the time when Greek philosophy was
beginning to be studied with great ardour and was received without
question. He admits the attributes of God and regards them as eternal,
but treats them on lines very similar to those employed by the
Christians in dealing with the divine hypostases, that is to say, they
are not external things

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

possessed by God but modes or phases of the divine essence. The will of
God for example, he treats as a mode of knowledge, that is to say that
God wills what is good is equivalent to saying that God knows it to be
good. But in dealing with the will we must distinguish between (a) that
which exists in place, as the moral rules in God's commandments to men,
for there could be no will against theft until the creation of things
which could be stolen; in such case the will exists in time and is
created, for it depends upon a created thing: and (b) that which exists
not in place and without an object to which the will refers, as when God
willed to create before the thing to be created existed. In man the
inner volition is free, but the outer acts are not free; sometimes they
are controlled by external forces in the body, or even outside the body,
and sometimes they are controlled by the inner volition. Aristotle
speaks of the universe as existing from eternity, but the Qur’an refers
to its creation, yet these are not inconsistent: we must suppose that it
existed eternally, but in perfect quiescence and stillness, as it were
latent and potential rather than actual, and without those qualities
which appear in the categories of logic and are to us the only known
terms of existence. Creation meant that God brought in movement so that
things began to exist in time and space, and the universe comes to an
end when it returns again to the state of absolute rest in which it was
at the beginning. Men can distinguish between good and evil by the light
of reason, for good

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

and evil have objective characters which can be recognised so that our
knowledge of this difference does not depend only on God's revelation:
but no man can know anything about God but by the medium of revelation
which is given principally for this purpose.

*Ibrahim b. Sayar an-Nazzam* (d. 231), the next great Mu‘tazilite leader
was a devoted student of the Greek philosophers and an encyclopædic
writer. In this he was typical of the earlier Arabic philosophers whose
endeavour was to apply Greek science to the interpretation of life and
nature generally, an aim which necessarily tended to produce
encyclopædic compilations rather than original studies in any one field
of knowledge. Already the Mu‘tazilites had reached the position that
good and evil represent objective realities and that God, knowing the
good does not will that which is contrary to it; but an-Nazzam presses
this further and asserts that God can do nothing in the creature save
what is for its good and is in itself just. To this the objection was
raised that in such case God's own acts are determined and are not free.
An-Nazzam replied that he admitted this determination, not in action but
in potentiality as God is restricted by his own nature. He attempted to
reproduce the ancient doctrine that the soul is the form of the body, as
had already been asserted by Aristotle, but he misunderstood the
terminology employed and represents the soul as of the same shape as the
body. This implies that the soul is a very

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

subtile kind of substance permeating the whole body in the same way as
butter permeates milk, or as oil permeates the sesame: both soul and
body are equal in size and alike in shape. Freedom of the will is
peculiar to God and man, all other created things are subject to
necessity. God created all things at once in remote eternity, but
reserved them in a state of quiescence so that they may be described as
"concealed," and then projected them into active existence at successive
intervals.

The next great Mu‘tazilite leader was *Bishr b. Mu‘tamir* (d. 226 circ.)
in whose work we find a more definite attempt to apply philosophical
speculation to the practical needs of Islam. In the case of free will he
enters directly into the question of how far external influences limit
freedom of the will and so diminish responsibility. Infants cannot be
condemned to eternal punishment because they have no responsibility,
having never exercised free will. Unbelievers, however, are condemned to
punishment because, although they have not the help of revelation, it is
possible for them to know that there must be a God, and only one God, by
the light of reason. In dealing with actions and their moral values we
have to consider not only one agent and one object, but often a series,
the act being transmitted from one to the other so that each of the
intervening objects becomes the agent to the next object. This serial
connection he termed "begetting" (*tawullud*).

*Ma‘mar b. Abbad as-Sulami* (d. 220) describes God

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

as creating substances but not accidents, so that he produced a kind of
universal matter common to all existing things and to this matter or
essence the accidents are added, some produced by a force inherent in
the essence created, others by free will on the part of the creature.
Following the neo-Platonic commentators on Aristotle he treats the
attributes of God as purely negative, so that God is unknowable by man.
In the case of wisdom or knowledge, that which is known must either be
identical with God, or external to him: if God is the agent who knows
and that which is known as object is also himself, there is a
distinction between God the agent and God the object which implies two
persons, and this is subversive of the divine unity: but if God is the
agent and knows something external to himself, that knowledge depends on
the external object, and God therefore is not absolute but in some sense
dependent on something other than himself. Hence the attributes of God
cannot be such as the positive qualities which exist in man, but only
the negation of those which are distinctively human and dependent: we
can only say that he is infinite, meaning unlimited in space, or eternal
as unlimited in time, or other like terms negative of the known things
which can be predicated of man. The general tendency of Ma‘mar's
teaching is distinctly pantheistic: partly this is due to the logical
development of a tendency already inherent in the neo-Platonic doctrine
with which all Arabic thought was now becoming saturated, and partly it

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

was due to oriental influences which were now beginning to appear in
Islam.

Ma‘mar's pantheism was more fully developed by *Tumameh b. al-Ashras*
(d. 213) who treats the world as indeed created by God, but created
according to a law of nature so that it is the expression of a force
latent in God and not due to an act of volition. Tumameh entirely
deserts al-Allaf's attempt to reconcile the Aristotelian doctrine of the
eternity of matter with the teaching of the Qur’an, and quite frankly
states that the universe is eternal like God. This is by no means the
last word in Islamic pantheism, but its subsequent development rather
belongs to the doctrines of the extremer Shi‘ite sects and to Sufism.

Reverting to an-Nazzam, the great leader of the middle age of the
Mu‘tazilites, we find his teaching continued by his pupils *Ahmad b.
Habit*, *Fadl al-Hudabi*, and *‘Amr b. Bakr al-Jahiz*. On the
theological side all the Mu‘tazilites admitted the eternal salvation of
good Muslims, and most agreed that unbelievers would receive eternal
punishment: but there were differences of view as to those who were
believers but died unrepentant in sin. For the most part the
Mu‘tazilites took the lax view that these would be favourably treated as
against the rigorist opinion which reserved eternal salvation to good
Muslims, an opinion which appeared amongst the stricter believers during
the ‘Umayyad period. The two first named of an-Nazzam's pupils, however,
introduced a new theory entirely repugnant to orthodox

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Islam, though
familiar to the extremer Shi‘ite sects, that those neither decisively
good nor absolutely bad pass by transmigration into other bodies until
they finally deserve either salvation or damnation. With these two
thinkers also we are brought into contact with another problem which now
began to present itself to Islam, the doctrine of the "beatific vision."
Islam generally had expected the vision of God to be the chief of the
rewards enjoyed in paradise, but the treatment of the attributes of God
had been so definitely against the anthropomorphic ideas expressed in
the Qur’an that it became difficult to explain what could be meant by
"seeing God." Ahmad and Fadl dealing with this subject deny that men
ever will or can see God; the beatific vision can at most mean that they
are brought face to face with the "Agent Intellect" which is an
emanation from the First Cause, and "seeing" in such a connection must
of course mean something quite different from what we understand as
vision.

*‘Amr b. Bakr al-Jahir* (d. 255), the third of an-Nazzam's pupils
mentioned above, may be regarded as the last of the middle period of the
Mu‘tazilites. He was an encyclopædic writer according to the fashion of
the time and wrote on literature, theology, logic, philosophy,
geography, natural history, and other subjects (cf. Masudi viii. 33,
etc.) To free will he gives rather a new bearing. The will he regards as
simply a manner of knowing and so as an accident of knowledge; a
voluntary act he defines as one known

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

to its agent. Those who are condemned to the fire of hell do not suffer
eternally by it, but are changed by its purification. The term "Muslim"
must be taken to include all who believe that God has neither form or
body, since the attribution of a human form to God is the essential mark
of the idolater, that he is just and wills no evil, and that Muhammad is
his prophet. Substance he treats as eternal, accidents are created and
variable.

We have now reached the third stage of the history of the Mu‘tazilites,
that which marks their decline. During this latter period they divide
into two schools, that of Basra giving its attention mainly to the
attributes of God, that of Baghdad being chiefly occupied with the more
purely philosophical discussion of what is meant by an existing thing.

The Basrite discussions received their final form in the dispute between
*al-Jubbay* (d. 303) and his son *Abu Hashim* (d. 321). The latter held
that the attributes of God are distinct modes of being, we know the
essence under such varying modes or conditions, but they are not
*states*, nor are they thinkable apart from the essence, though they are
distinct from it but do not exist apart from it. Against this his father
objected that these subjective attributes are only names and convey no
concept. The attributes are thus asserted to be neither qualities nor
states so as to imply subject or agent, but they are inseparably united
with the essence.

Against all views of this sort the orthodox adhered,

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

and still adhere to the opinion that God has real qualities. Those who
laid emphasis on this in opposition to the Mu‘tazilite speculations are
commonly known as *Sifatites* (*sifat*, qualities), but they admit that,
as God is not like a man, the qualities attributed to him in the Qur’an
are not the same as those qualities bearing the same names which are
referred to men, and it is not possible for us to know the real import
of the qualities attributed to God.

A more pronounced recoil against the Mu‘tazilite speculations appears in
Abu ‘Abdullah b. Karram (d. 256) and his followers who were known as
Karramites. These returned to a crude anthropomorphism and held that God
not only has qualities of precisely the same kind as a man may have, but
that he actually sits on a throne, etc., taking in plain literal sense
all the statements made in the Qur’an.

The Mu‘tazilite school of Baghdad concerned itself mainly with the
metaphysical question—"what is a thing?" It was admitted that "thing"
denotes a concept which could be known and could serve as subject to a
predicate. It does not necessarily exist, for existence is a quality
added to the essence: with this addition the essence becomes an entity
(*mawjud*), without this addition it is a non-entity (*ma‘dum*) but
still has substance and accident, so that God creates by adding the
single attribute of existence.

The whole course of Mu‘tazilite speculation shows the influence of Greek
philosophy as applied to Muslim theology, but the influence is for the
most

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

part indirect. The ideas of Aristotle, as the course of speculation
projected to the fore-front the problems with which he had dealt in
times past, were received through a Syriac Christian medium, for the
most part imperfectly understood and somewhat modified by the emphasis
which Christian controversy had given to certain particular aspects.
More or less directly prompted by the Mu‘tazilite controversy we have
three other lines of development: in the first place we have the
"philosophers" as the name is used by the Arabic writers, meaning those
students and commentators who based their work directly on the Greek
text or at least on the later and better versions. In their hands
philosophical enquiry took a somewhat changed direction as they began to
understand better the real meaning of what Aristotle had taught. In the
second place we have the orthodox theology of al-Ash‘ari, al-Ghazali,
and others, which represents Muslim theological science as modified and
partly directed by Aristotelian philosophy, consciously endeavouring to
make a working compromise between that philosophy and Muslim theology.
The older Mu‘tazilite tradition came to an end in the time of
al-Ash‘ari: men who felt the force of philosophical questions either
adopted the orthodox scholasticism of al-Ash‘ari and those who came
after him, or followed the course of the philosophers and drift

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

away from the traditional beliefs of Islam altogether. In the third
place we have the Sufi movement, in which we find neo-Platonic elements
mingled with others from the east, from India and Persia. The
[Mu‘tazilites](errata.htm#15.md) proper come to an end with the fourth
century A.H.
