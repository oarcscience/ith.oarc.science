### FOREWORD

History traces the evolution of the social structure in which the
community exists to-day. There are three chief factors at work in this
evolution; racial descent, culture drift, and transmission of language:
the first of these physiological and not necessarily connected with the
other two, whilst those two are not always associated with each other.
In the evolution of the social structure the factor of first importance
is the transmission of culture, which is not a matter of heredity but
due to contact, for culture is learned and reproduced by imitation and
not inherited. Culture must be taken in the widest sense to include
political, social, and legal institutions, the arts and crafts,
religion, and the various forms of intellectual life which show their
presence in literature, philosophy, and otherwise, all more or less
connected, and all having the common characteristic that they cannot be
passed on by physical descent but must be learned in after life. But
race, culture, and language resemble one another in so far as it is true
that all are multiplex and perpetually interwoven, so that in each the
lines of transmission seem rather like a tangled skein than an ordered
pattern; results proceed from a conflicting group of causes amongst
which it is often difficult to apportion the relative influences.

The culture of modern Europe derives from that of the Roman Empire,
itself the multiple resultant

<span id="page_iv">p. iv</span>

of many forces, amongst which the intellectual life of Hellenism was
most effective, but worked into a coherent system by the wonderful power
of organization, which was one of the most salient characteristics of
that Empire. The whole cultural life of mediæval Europe shows this
Hellenistic-Roman culture passed on, developed, and modified by
circumstances. As the Empire fell to pieces the body of culture became
subject to varying conditions in different localities, of which the
divergence between the Greek-speaking East and the Latin-speaking West
is the most striking example. The introduction of Muslim influence
through Spain is the one instance in which we seem to get an alien
culture entering into this Roman tradition and exercising a disturbing
influence. In fact, this Muslim culture was at bottom essentially a part
of the Hellenistic-Roman material, even the theology of Islam being
formulated and developed from Hellenistic sources, but Islam had so long
lived apart from Christendom and its development had taken place in
surroundings so different that it seems a strange and alien thing. Its
greatest power lay in the fact that it presented the old material in an
entirely fresh form.

It is the effort of the following pages to trace the transmission of
Hellenistic thought through the medium of Muslim philosophers and Jewish
thinkers who lived in Muslim surroundings, to show how this thought,
modified as it passed through a period of development in the Muslim
community and itself modifying Islamic ideas, was brought to bear upon
the culture of mediæval Latin Christendom. So greatly had it altered in
external form during the centuries of its life apart, that it seemed a
new type of

<span id="page_v">p. v</span>

intellectual life and became a disturbing factor which diverted
Christian philosophy into new lines and tended to disintegrate the
traditional theology of the Church, directly leading up to the
Renascence which gave the death-blow to mediæval culture: so little had
it altered in real substance that it used the same text-books and
treated very much the same problems already current in the earlier
scholasticism which had developed independently in Latin Christendom. It
will be our effort so to trace the history of mediæval Muslim thought as
to show the elements which it had in common with Christian teaching and
to account for the points of divergence.
