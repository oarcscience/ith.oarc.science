The transmission of ancient Greek philosophy to the forerunners of the
Renaissance was through the Islamic world. This book details each of the
steps along that path, identifying the Syriac writers of the late
classical period as introducing Hellenic philosophy into the Middle
East. The book details the growth of Islam, including the major branches
such as the Shia, Sunni, and Sufi, and many minor as well, and their
relation to the schools of Islamic philosophy. From the Baghdad of the
Arabian Nights, we pass to Islamic Spain, where Arabic philosophy was
increased by both Muslim and Jewish scholars. Finally, we see how Plato
and Aristotle were re-introduced into Europe through Christian scholars,
and became one of the precursors of the Italian Renaissance. The
equivalent of a college-level course on the history of Islamic thought,
this book is essential background reading if you want to understand this
topic.

NOTE: A short bibliography included in the Dover reprint was found to
have not have been present in the 1922 edition. It is not included in
this etext. Hence there is a page gap between the timeline and the
index. In addition, the timeline is omitted from the text-only version
for technical reasons. We will attempt to address this at some
point.--J.B. Hare, Dec. 15, 2007
