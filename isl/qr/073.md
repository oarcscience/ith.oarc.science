### SURA LXXIII. THE ENFOLDED <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) \[III.\]

MECCA. 20 Verses.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
O THOU ENFOLDED in thy mantle,  
Stand up all night, except a small portion of it, for prayer:  
Half; or curtail the half a little,--  
Or add to it: And with measured tone intone the Koran, <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md)  
For we shall devolve on thee weighty words.  
Verily, at the oncoming of night are devout impressions strongest, and
words are most collected; <span id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33.md)  
But in the day time thou hast continual employ--  
And commemorate the name of thy Lord, and devote thyself to Him with
entire devotion.  
Lord of the East and of the West! No God is there but He! Take Him for
thy protector,  
And endure what they say with patience, and depart from them with a
decorous departure.  
And let Me alone with the gainsayers, rich in the pleasures of this
life; and bear thou with them yet a little while:  
For with Us are strong fetters, and a flaming fire,  
And food that choketh, and a sore torment.  
The day cometh when the earth and the mountains shall be shaken; and the
mountains shall become a loose sand heap.  
Verily, we have sent you an Apostle to witness against you, even as we
sent an Apostle to Pharaoh:  
But Pharaoh rebelled against the Apostle, and we therefore laid hold on
him with a severe chastisement.  
And how, if ye believe not, will you screen yourselves from the day that
shall turn children greyheaded?  
The very heaven shall be reft asunder by it: this threat shall be
carried into effect.  
Lo! this is a warning. Let him then who will, take the way to his
Lord.  
Of a truth, <span id="fr_34"></span>[4](#fn_34.md) thy Lord knoweth that
thou prayest almost two-thirds, or half, or a third of the night, as do
a part of thy followers. But God measureth the night and the day: He
knoweth that ye cannot count its hours aright, and therefore, turneth to
you mercifully. Recite then so much of the Koran as may be easy to you.
He knoweth that there will be some among you sick, while others travel
through the earth in quest of the bounties of God; and others do battle
in his cause. Recite therefore so much of it as may be easy. And observe
the Prayers and pay the legal Alms, <span id="fr_35"></span>[5](#fn_35.md)
and lend God a liberal loan: for whatever good works ye send on before
for your own behoof, ye shall find with God. This will be best and
richest in the recompense. And seek the forgiveness of God: verily, God
is forgiving, Merciful.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_31"></span>[1](073.htm#fr_31.md) From the first line of this
Sura, and its expressions concerning the Koran, Prayer, and Future
Punishment: from the similarity of the tradition with regard to its
having been preceded by a vision of Gabriel (Beidh., etc.), it seems to
belong to, or at least to describe, a period, perhaps immediately
succeeding the Fatrah, during which the hours of night were spent by
Muhammad in devotion and in the labour of working up his materials in
rhythmical and rhyming Suras, and in preparation for the public
assumption of the prophetic office. Comp. especially verses 11, 19, 20,
at the end, with 11, 54, 55, of the preceding Sura.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[2](073.htm#fr_32.md) Singe den Koran laut. H.v.P.
Psalle Alcoranum psallendo. Mar. Singe den Koran mit singender und
lauter Stimme ab. Ullm.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[3](073.htm#fr_33.md) Lit. most firm, perhaps,
distinct.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[4](073.htm#fr_34.md) This verse, according to a
tradition of Ayesha, was revealed one year later than the previous part
of the Sura. Nöldeke says it is "offenbar ein Medinischer."

<span id="fn_35"></span>[5](073.htm#fr_35.md) The reader will not be
surprised to find in the very outset of Muhammad's career a frequent
mention of Alms, Prayer, Heaven, Hell, Judgment, Apostles, etc., in
their usual sense, when he remembers that Judaism was extensively
naturalised in Arabia, and Christianity, also, although to a smaller
extent. The words and phrases of these religions were doubtless familiar
to the Meccans, especially to that numerous body who were anxiously
searching after some better religion than the idolatries of their
fathers (v. on Sura iii. 19, 60), and provided Muhammad with a copious
fund from which to draw.
