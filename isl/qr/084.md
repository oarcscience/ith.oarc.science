### SURA LXXXIV.--THE SPLITTING ASUNDER \[XXXIII.\]

MECCA.--25 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
WHEN the Heaven shall have SPLIT ASUNDER  
And duteously obeyed its Lord; <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md)  
And when Earth shall have been stretched out as a plain,  
And shall have cast forth what was in her and become empty,  
And duteously obeyed its Lord;  
Then verily, O man, who desirest to reach thy Lord, shalt thou meet
him.  
And he into whose right hand his Book shall be given,  
Shall be reckoned with in an easy reckoning,  
And shall turn, rejoicing, to his kindred.  
But he whose Book shall be given him behind his back <span
id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_89.md)  
Shall invoke destruction:  
But in the fire shall he burn,  
For that he lived joyously among his kindred,  
Without a thought that he should return to God.  
Yea, but his Lord beheld him.  
It needs not therefore that I swear by the sunset redness,  
And by the night and its gatherings,  
And by the moon when at her full,  
That from state to state shall ye be surely carried onward. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[3](#fn_90.md)  
What then hath come to them that they believe not?  
And that when the Koran is recited to them they adore not?  
Yea, the unbelievers treat it as a lie.  
But God knoweth their secret hatreds:  
Let their only tidings <span id="fr_91"></span>[4](#fn_91.md) be those of
painful punishment;  
Save to those who believe and do the things that be right.  
An unfailing recompense shall be theirs.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_88"></span>[1](084.htm#fr_88.md) Lit. and obeyed its Lord, and
shall be worthy, or capable, i.e., of obedience.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[2](084.htm#fr_89.md) That is, into his left hand.
The Muhammadans believe that the right hand of the damned will be
chained to the neck; the left chained behind the back.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[3](084.htm#fr_90.md) From Life to Death, from the
Grave to Resurrection, thence to Paradise.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[4](084.htm#fr_91.md) The expression is ironical.
See Freyt. on the word. Lit. tell them glad tidings.
