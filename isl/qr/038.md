### SURA XXXVIII.--SAD \[LIX.\]

MECCA.--88 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
SAD. <span id="fr_319"></span>[1](#fn_319.md) By the Koran full of warning!
In sooth the Infidels are absorbed in pride, in contention with thee.  
How many generations have we destroyed before them! And they cried for
mercy but no time was it of escape!  
And they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come to them;
and the Infidels say, "This is a sorcerer, a liar:  
Maketh he the gods to be but one god? A strange thing forsooth is
this!"  
And their chiefs took themselves off. "Go, said they, and cleave
steadfastly <span id="fr_320"></span>[2](#fn_320.md) to your gods. Ye see
the thing aimed at.  
We heard not of this in the previous creed. <span
id="fr_321"></span>[3](#fn_321.md) It is but an imposture:  
To him alone of us all hath a book of warning been sent down?" Yes! they
are in doubt as to my warnings, for they have not yet tasted my
vengeance.  
Are the treasures of the mercy of thy Lord, the Mighty, the bounteous,
in their hands?  
Is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is
between them theirs? Then let them mount up by cords!  
Any army of the confederates <span id="fr_322"></span>[4](#fn_322.md) shall
here be routed.  
Before them the people of Noah and Ad and Pharaoh the impaler <span
id="fr_323"></span>[5](#fn_323.md) treated their prophets as impostors;  
And Themoud, and the people of Lot, and the dwellers in the forest:
these were the confederates.  
Nought did they all but charge the apostles with falsehood: Just,
therefore, the retribution.  
And these (Meccans) await but one single trumpet blast--There shall be
no delaying it--  
Yet they dare to say, "O our Lord! hasten our lot to us, before the day
of reckoning."  
Put thou up with what they say: and remember our servant David, a man
strong of hand <span id="fr_324"></span>[6](#fn_324.md), one who turned him
to Us in penitence:  
We constrained the mountains <span id="fr_325"></span>[7](#fn_325.md) to
join with him in lauds at even and at sunrise;  
And the birds which flocked to him, and would all return to him oft;  
And we stablished his kingdom: and wisdom, and skill to pronounce clear
decisions, did we bestow on him.  
Hath the story of the two pleaders <span id="fr_326"></span>[8](#fn_326.md)
reached thee, O Muhammad, when they mounted the walls of his closet?  
When they entered in upon David, and he was frightened at them, they
said, "Be not afraid; we are two opposing parties: one of us hath
wronged the other. Judge therefore with truth between us, and be not
unjust, but guide us to the right way.  
Now this my brother had ninety and nine ewes, and I had but a single
ewe; and he said, make me her keeper. And he over-persuaded me in the
dispute."  
He said, "Certainly he hath wronged thee in asking for thine ewe to add
her to his own ewes: and truly many associates do one another
wrong--except those who believe and do the things that are right; and
few indeed are they!" And David perceived that we had tried him; so he
asked pardon of his Lord, and fell down and bowed himself and
repented.  
So we forgave him that his sin; and truly he shall have a high rank with
Us, and an excellent retreat in Paradise.  
O David! verily we have made thee our vicegerent upon earth. Judge
therefore between men with truth, and follow not thy passions, lest they
cause thee to err from the way of God. For they who err from the way of
God shall meet with a grievous chastisement, for that they have
forgotten the day of reckoning.  
We have not created the heaven and the earth and what is between them
for nought. That is the thought of infidels; but woe to the infidels
because of the fire!  
Shall we treat those who believe and do the things that are right like
those who propagate evil on earth? Shall we treat the God-fearing like
the impious?  
A blessed Book <span id="fr_327"></span>[9](#fn_327.md) have we sent down
to thee, that men may meditate its verses, and that those endued with
understanding may bear it in mind.  
And Solomon gave we unto David. An excellent servant, for he loved to
turn him Godward.  
Remember when at eventide the prancing <span
id="fr_328"></span>[10](#fn_328.md) chargers were displayed before him,  
And he said, "Truly I have loved the love of earthly goods above the
remembrance of my Lord, till the sun hath been hidden by the veil of
darkness. <span id="fr_329"></span>[11](#fn_329.md)  
Bring them back to me." And he began to sever the legs and necks.  
We also made trial of Solomon, and placed a phantom <span
id="fr_330"></span>[12](#fn_330.md) on his throne: whereupon he returned to
Us (in penitence).  
He said, O my Lord! pardon me, and give me a dominion that may not be to
any one beside me, for thou art the liberal giver.  
So we subjected the wind to him; it ran softly at his bidding,
whithersoever he directed it:  
And the Satans--every builder and diver--  
And others bound in chains: <span id="fr_331"></span>[13](#fn_331.md)  
"This," said we, "is our gift: be bounteous then, or withhold thy
favours; no account shalt thou render."  
And his rank also is high with Us, and an excellent retreat.  
And remember our servant Job when he cried to his Lord, "Verily, Satan
hath laid on me disease and pain."  
"Stamp," said we, "with thy foot. This <span
id="fr_332"></span>[14](#fn_332.md) is to wash with; cool, and to drink."  
And we gave him back his family, and as many more with them in our
mercy; and for a monition to men of judgment.  
And we said, "Take in thine hand a rod, and strike <span
id="fr_333"></span>[15](#fn_333.md) with it, nor break thine oath." Verily,
we found him patient!  
How excellent a servant, one who turned to Us was he!  
And remember our servants Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, men of might and
vision. <span id="fr_334"></span>[16](#fn_334.md)  
With this cleansing did we cleanse them the remembrance of the abode of
Paradise.  
And verily, they were, in our sight, of the elect and of the good.  
And remember Ishmael and Elisha and Dhoulkefl, for all these were of the
just.  
This is a monition: and verily, the pious shall have a goodly retreat:  
Gardens of Eden, whose portals shall stand open to them:  
Therein reclining, they shall there call for many a fruit and drink:  
And with them shall be virgins of their own age, with modest retiring
glances:  
"This is what ye were promised at the day of reckoning."  
"Yes! this is our provision: it shall never fail."  
Even so. But for the evil doers is a wretched home--  
Hell--wherein they shall be burned: how wretched a bed!  
Even so. Let them then taste it--boiling water and gore,  
And other things of kindred sort!  
To their leaders it shall be said, "This company shall be thrown in
headlong with you. No greetings shall await them, for they shall be
burned in the fire."  
They shall say: "But ye, too! there shall be no welcome for you. It was
ye who prepared this for us, and wretched is the abode!"  
They will say: "O our Lord! increase twofold in the fire, the punishment
of him who hath brought this upon us."  
And they will say: "Why see we not the men whom we numbered among the
wicked--  
Whom we used to treat with scorn? Have they escaped our eyes?" <span
id="fr_335"></span>[17](#fn_335.md)  
Verily this is truth--the wrangling together of the people of the
fire.  
SAY: I am but a warner; and there is no God but God the One, the
Almighty!  
Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth, and of all that is between
them, <span id="fr_336"></span>[18](#fn_336.md) the Potent, the
Forgiving!  
SAY: this is a weighty message, <span id="fr_337"></span>[19](#fn_337.md)  
From which ye turn aside!  
Yet had I no knowledge of what passed among the celestial chiefs when
they disputed, <span id="fr_338"></span>[20](#fn_338.md)  
--Verily, it hath been revealed to me only because I am a public
preacher--  
When thy Lord said to the angels, "I am about to make man of clay, <span
id="fr_339"></span>[21](#fn_339.md)  
And when I have formed him and breathed my spirit into him, then
worshipping fall down before him."  
And the angels prostrated themselves, all of them with one accord,  
Save Eblis. He swelled with pride, and became an unbeliever.  
"O Eblis," said God, "what hindereth thee from prostrating thyself
before him whom my hands have made?  
Is it that thou are puffed up with pride? or art thou a being of lofty
merit?"  
He said: "I am more excellent than he; me hast thou created of
fire: <span id="fr_340"></span>[22](#fn_340.md) of clay hast thou created
him."  
He said: "Begone then hence: thou art accursed, <span
id="fr_341"></span>[23](#fn_341.md)  
And lo! my ban shall be on thee till the day of the reckoning."  
He said: "O my Lord! respite me till the day of Resurrection."  
He said, "One then of the respited shalt thou be,  
Till the day of the time appointed."  
He said: "I swear by thy might then that all of them will I seduce,  
Save thy sincere servants among them."  
He said: "It is truth, and the truth I speak. From thee will I surely
fill Hell, and with such of them as shall follow thee, one and all.  
Say: I ask no wage of you for this, nor am I one who intermeddleth.  
Of a truth the Koran is no other than a warning to all creatures.  
And after a time shall ye surely know its message.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_319"></span>[1](038.htm#fr_319.md) The letter S. See Sura
lxviii. p. 32.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[2](038.htm#fr_320.md) These verses are said to
have been revealed when, upon the conversion of Omar, the Koreisch went
in a body to Abu Talib and requested him to withdraw his protection from
Muhammad, but being put to silence by the latter, departed in great
confusion. Wah. Beidh.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[3](038.htm#fr_321.md) That is, in the Christian
religion, which teaches, Muhammad ironically implies, a plurality of
Gods.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[4](038.htm#fr_322.md) This may allude to the
so-called "confederacy" of the Koreisch against Muhammad.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[5](038.htm#fr_323.md) This term is also applied
to Pharaoh, Sura lxxxix. 9, p. 54. He is said to have fastened the
Israelites to stakes, and then subjected them to various torments.

addenda: This is the usual interpretation. Lit. Lord of, or, possessor
of stakes (comp. li. 39 in Ar.), i.e., Forces. Dr. Sprenger ingenuously
suggests that Muhammad’s Jewish informant may have described Pharaoh as
rich in neçyb, i.e., fortresses; whereas, in Ar., naçyb, means an
erection, pillar, etc., for which Muhammad substituted the word for tent
stakes. Vol. i. (470).

<span id="fn_324"></span>[6](038.htm#fr_324) Præditi (manibus.md) virtute.
Mar.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[7](038.htm#fr_325.md) Comp. Ps. cxlviii. 9, 10.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[8](038.htm#fr_326.md) Two angels who pretended to
appeal to David in order to convince him of his sin in the matter of
Uriah's wife. Comp. I Sam. xii.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[9](038.htm#fr_327.md) The Psalms, if we suppose
with Nöldeke, p. 99, that David is still addressed: the Koran, if with
Sale we refer the passage to Muhammad.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[10](038.htm#fr_328.md) The Commentators say that
the word used in the original implies that the mares stood on three
feet, and touched the ground with the edge of the fourth foot.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[11](038.htm#fr_329.md) Solomon, in his admiration
of these horses, the result, we are told, of David's or his own
conquests, forgot the hour of evening prayer, and when aware of his
fault commenced their slaughter. The Tr. Sanhedr. fol. 21, mentions
Solomon's love for horses, and that he determined to have a large stud;
yet not to send the people to Egypt (Deut. xvii. 16) but to have them
brought to him out of Egypt (I Kings x. 28).

<span id="fn_330"></span>[12](038.htm#fr_330.md) One of the Djinn. The
absurd fiction may be seen in extenso in Sale. Compare Tr. Sanhedr. fol.
20, b. and Midr. Jalkut on I Kings vi. § 182.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[13](038.htm#fr_331.md) Thus the second Targum on
Esther i. 2, mentions the four different kinds of Demons which were
"given into the hand" of Solomon--a legend derived from a
misunderstanding of Eccl. ii. 8.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[14](038.htm#fr_332.md) The fountain which had
sprung up. To this history the Talmudists have no allusion.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[15](038.htm#fr_333.md) Thy wife;--on whom he had
sworn that he would inflict an hundred blows, because she had absented
herself from him when in need of her assistance, or for her words (Job
ii. 9). The oath was kept, we are told, by his giving her one blow with
a rod of a hundred stalks. This passage is often quoted by the Muslims
as authorising any similar manner of release from an oath
inconsiderately taken.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[16](038.htm#fr_334.md) Lit. men of hand and of
sight.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[17](038.htm#fr_335.md) Lit. or do our eyes wander
from them.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[18](038.htm#fr_336.md) See verses 9, 26, above.
It seems to have been one of the peculiarities of Muhammad, as a person
very deficient in imagination, to dwell upon and repeat the same ideas,
with an intensity which is at once an evidence of deep personal
conviction and consciousness, of the simple Arabian especially.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[19](038.htm#fr_337.md) The connection between the
concluding episode and the preceding part of the Sura does not seem very
clear. It probably originated at a different but uncertain period.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[20](038.htm#fr_338.md) About the creation of man.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[21](038.htm#fr_339.md) Comp. Sura \[xci.\] ii.
28, ff.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[22](038.htm#fr_340.md) Comp. Ps. civ. 4.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[23](038.htm#fr_341.md) Lit. stoned. See Sura xv.
34, p. 114.
