### SURA XXV.--AL FURKAN \[LXVI.\]

MECCA.--77 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
BLESSED be He who hath sent down AL FURKAN <span
id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_425) (the illumination) on his servant, that
to all creatures he may be a warner.  
His the Kingdom of the Heavens and of the Earth! No son hath He
begotten! No partner hath He in his Empire! All things hath He created,
and decreeing hath decreed their destinies.  
Yet have they adopted gods beside Him which have created nothing, but
were themselves created:  
And no power have they over themselves for evil or for good, nor have
they power of death, or of life, or of raising the dead.  
And the infidels say, "This Koran is a mere fraud of his own devising,
and others have helped him with it, <span
id="fr_426"></span>[2](#fn_426) who had come hither by outrage and
lie." <span id="fr_427"></span>[3](#fn_427)  
And they say, "Tales of the ancients that he hath put in writing! and
they were dictated to him morn and even."  
SAY: He hath sent it down who knoweth the secrets of the Heavens and of
the Earth. He truly is the Gracious, the Merciful.  
And they say, "What sort of apostle is this? He eateth food and he
walketh the streets! Unless an angel be sent down and take part in his
warnings,  
Or a treasure be thrown down to him, or he have a garden that supplieth
him with food . . ." <span id="fr_428"></span>[4](#fn_428) and those
unjust persons say, "Ye follow but a man enchanted."  
See what likenesses they strike out for thee! But they err, and cannot
find their way.  
Blessed be He who if he please can give thee better than that of which
they speak--Gardens, 'neath which the rivers flow: and pavilions will He
assign thee.  
Aye, they have treated the coming of "the Hour" as a lie. But a flaming
fire have we got ready for those who treat the coming of the Hour as a
lie.  
When it shall see them from afar, they shall hear its raging and
roaring,--  
And when they shall be flung into a narrow space thereof bound together,
they shall invoke destruction on the spot:  
--"Call not this day for one destruction, but call for destructions
many."  
SAY: Is this, or the Paradise of Eternity which was promised to the God-
fearing, best? Their recompense shall it be and their retreat;  
Abiding therein for ever, they shall have in it all that they desire! It
is a promise to be claimed of thy Lord.  
And on the day when he shall gather them together, and those whom they
worshipped beside God, he will say, "Was it ye who led these my servants
astray, or of themselves strayed they from the path?"  
They will say, "Glory be to thee! It beseemed not us to take other lords
than thee. But thou gavest them and their fathers their fill of good
things, till they forgat the remembrance of thee, and became a lost
people."  
Then will God say to the Idolaters, "Now have they made you liars in
what ye say, <span id="fr_429"></span>[5](#fn_429) and they have no
power to avert your doom, or to succour you."  
And whosoever of you thus offendeth, we will make him taste a great
punishment.  
Never have we sent Apostles before thee who ate not common food, and
walked not the streets. And we test you by means of each other. Will ye
be steadfast? Thy Lord is looking on!  
They who look not forward to meet Us say, "If the angels be not sent
down to us, or unless we behold our Lord. . . .” Ah! they are proud of
heart, and exceed with great excess!  
On the day when they shall see the angels, no good news shall there be
for the guilty ones, and they shall cry out, "A barrier that cannot be
passed!" <span id="fr_430"></span>[6](#fn_430)  
Then will we proceed to the works which they have wrought, and make them
as scattered dust.  
Happier, on that day, the inmates of the Garden as to abode, and better
off as to place of noontide slumber!  
On that day shall the heaven with its clouds be cleft, and the angels
shall be sent down, descending:  
On that day shall all empire be in very deed with the God of Mercy, and
a hard day shall it be for the Infidels.  
And on that day shall the wicked one <span
id="fr_431"></span>[7](#fn_431) bite his hands, and say, "Oh! would that
I had taken the same path with the Apostle!  
"Oh! woe is me! would that I had not taken such an one <span
id="fr_432"></span>[8](#fn_432) for my friend!  
It was he who led me astray from the Warning which had reached me! and
Satan is man's betrayer." <span id="fr_433"></span>[9](#fn_433)  
Then said the Apostle, "O my Lord! truly my people have esteemed this
Koran to be vain babbling."  
Thus have we given to every Prophet an enemy from among the wicked
ones--But thy Lord is a sufficient guide and helper.  
And the infidels say, "Unless the Koran be sent down to him all at once.
. . ." But in this way would we stablish thy heart by it; in parcels
have we parcelled it out to thee; <span
id="fr_434"></span>[10](#fn_434)  
Nor shall they come to thee with puzzling questions, <span
id="fr_435"></span>[11](#fn_435) but we will come to thee with the
truth, and their best solution.  
They who shall be gathered upon their faces into hell, shall have the
worst place, and be farthest from the path of happiness.  
Heretofore we gave the law to Moses, and appointed his brother Aaron to
be his counsellor: <span id="fr_436"></span>[12](#fn_436)  
And we said, "Go ye to the people who treat our signs as lies." And them
destroyed we with utter destruction.  
And as to the people of Noah! when they treated their Apostles as
impostors, we drowned them; and we made them a sign to mankind:--A
grievous chastisement have we prepared for the wicked!  
And Ad and Themoud, and the men of Rass, <span
id="fr_437"></span>[13](#fn_437) and divers generations between them:  
Unto each of them did we set forth parables for warnings, and each of
them did we utterly exterminate.  
Oft are this have the unbelieving Meccans passed by the city on which
was rained a fatal rain. What! Have they not seen it? Yet have they no
hope of a resurrection!  
And when they see thee, they do but take thee as the subject of their
railleries. "What! Is this he whom God has sent as an Apostle?  
Indeed he had well nigh led us astray from our gods, had we not
persevered steadfastly in their service." But in the end they shall
know, when they shall see the punishment, who hath most strayed from the
path.  
What thinkest thou? He who hath taken his passions as a god--wilt thou
be a guardian over him?  
Thinkest thou that the greater part of them hear or understand? They are
just like the brutes! Yes! they stray even further from the right way.  
Hast thou not seen how thy Lord lengtheneth out the shadow? <span
id="fr_438"></span>[14](#fn_438) Had He pleased he had made it
motionless. <span id="fr_439"></span>[15](#fn_439) But we made the sun
to be its guide;  
Then draw it in unto Us with easy indrawing.  
He it is who ordaineth the night as a garment, and sleep for rest, and
ordaineth the day for waking up to life:  
He it is who sendeth the winds as the forerunner of his mercy (rain);
and pure water send we down from Heaven,  
That we may revive by it a dead land: and we give it for drink to our
creation, beasts and men in numbers;  
And we distribute it among them on all sides, that they may reflect: but
most men refuse to be aught but thankless.  
Had we pleased, we had raised up a warner in every city.  
Give not way therefore to the Infidels, but by means of this Koran
strive against them with a mighty strife.  
And He it is who hath let loose the two seas, <span
id="fr_440"></span>[16](#fn_440) the one sweet, fresh; and the other
salt, bitter; and hath put an interspace between them, and a barrier
that cannot be passed.  
And it is He who hath created man of water, <span
id="fr_441"></span>[17](#fn_441) and established between them the ties
of kindred and affinity: and potent is thy Lord.  
Yet beside God do they worship what can neither help nor hurt them: and
the Infidel is Satan's helper against his Lord:  
Still we have sent thee only as a herald and a warner.  
SAY: I ask of you no recompense for it, <span
id="fr_442"></span>[18](#fn_442) except from him who is willing to take
the way to his Lord.  
And put thou thy trust in Him that liveth and dieth not, and celebrate
his praise; (He fully knoweth the faults of his servants) who in six
days created the Heavens and the Earth, and whatever is between them,
then mounted his Throne: the God of Mercy! Ask now of the Wise
concerning Him.  
But when it is said to them, "Bow down before the God of Mercy," they
say, "Who is the God of Mercy? Shall we bow down to what thou biddest?"
And they fly from thee the more.  
Blessed be He who hath placed in the Heaven the sign of the
Zodiac! <span id="fr_443"></span>[19](#fn_443) who hath placed in it the
Lamp of the Sun, and the light-giving Moon!  
And it is He who hath ordained the night and the day to succeed one
another for those who desire to think on God or desire to be thankful.  
And the servants of the God of Mercy are they who walk upon the Earth
softly; and when the ignorant <span id="fr_444"></span>[20](#fn_444)
address them, they reply, "Peace!"  
They that pass the night in the worship of their lord prostrate and
standing:--  
And that say, "O our Lord! turn away from us the torment of Hell, for
its torment is endless: it is indeed an ill abode and resting place!  
Those who when they spend are neither lavish nor niggard, but keep the
mean:--  
Those who call on no other gods with God, nor slay whom God hath
forbidden to be slain, except for a just cause, and who commit not
fornication (for he who doth this shall meet the reward of his
wickedness:  
Doubled to him shall be the torment on the day of Resurrection; and in
it shall he remain, disgraced, for ever:--  
Save those who shall repent and believe and do righteous works--for them
God will change their evil things into good things, for God is Gracious,
Merciful--  
And whose turneth to God and doeth what is right, he verily will convert
with a true conversion):  
And they who bear not witness to that which is false, and when they pass
by frivolous sport, pass on with dignity:--  
And they who, when monished by the signs of their Lord, fall not down
thereat, as if deaf and blind:--  
And who say, "O our Lord! give us in our wives and offspring the joy of
our eyes, and make us examples to those who fear thee:"  
These shall be rewarded with the High Places of Paradise for their
steadfast endurance, and they shall meet therein with--Welcome and
Salutation:--  
For ever shall they remain therein: a fair abode and resting-place!  
SAY: Not on your account doth my Lord care if ye call not on Him! ye
have treated his Apostle as an impostor: but bye and bye a punishment
shall cleave to them.
