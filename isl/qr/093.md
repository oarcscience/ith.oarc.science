### SURA XCIII. <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md)--THE BRIGHTNESS \[IV.\]

MECCA.--11 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
BY the noon-day BRIGHTNESS,  
And by the night when it darkeneth!  
Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither hath he been displeased.  
And surely the Future shall be better for thee than the Past,  
And in the end shall thy Lord be bounteous to thee and thou be
satisfied.  
Did he not find thee an orphan <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md) and
gave thee a home?  
And found thee erring and guided thee, <span
id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md)  
And found thee needy and enriched thee.  
As to the orphan therefore wrong him not;  
And as to him that asketh of thee, chide him not away;  
And as for the favours of thy Lord tell them abroad.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_36"></span>[1](093.htm#fr_36.md) This and the six following
Suras are expressions of a state of deep mental anxiety and depression,
in which Muhammad seeks to reassure himself by calling to mind the past
favours of God, and by fixing his mind steadfastly on the Divine Unity.
They belong to a period either before the public commencement of his
ministry or when his success was very dubious, and his future career by
no means clearly marked out.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[2](093.htm#fr_37.md) The charge of the orphaned
Muhammad was undertaken by Abd-al-Mutalib, his grandfather, A.D. 576.
Hishami, p. 35; Kitab al Wakidi, p. 22, have preserved traditions of the
fondness with which the old man of fourscore years treated the child,
spreading a rug for him under the shadow of the Kaaba, protecting him
from the rudeness of his own sons, etc.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[3](093.htm#fr_38.md) Up to his 40th year Muhammad
followed the religion of his countrymen. Waq. Tabari says that when he
first entered on his office of Prophet, even his wife Chadijah had read
the Scriptures, and was acquainted with the History of the Prophets.
Spreng. p. 100. But his conformity can only have been partial.
