### SURA XXXIII.--THE CONFEDERATES <span id="fr_1111"></span>[1](#fn_1111.md) \[CIII.\]

MEDINA.--73 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

O PROPHET, fear thou God, and obey not the unbelievers and the
hypocrites;-- Truly God is Knowing, Wise:

But follow what is revealed to thee from thy Lord: Cognisant truly is He
of all your actions--

And put thou thy trust in God, for a sufficient guardian is God.

God hath not given a man two hearts within him; neither hath he made
your wives whom ye divorce <span id="fr_1112"></span>[2](#fn_1112.md) to be
as your mothers; nor hath he made your adopted sons to be as your own
sons. Such words are indeed in your mouths; but God speaketh the truth,
and in the right way He guideth.

Name them after their fathers: this will be more right before God. But
if ye know not who their fathers are, then let them be your brethren in
the faith, and your comrades. And unless made with intent of heart,
mistakes in this matter shall be no crime in you: for God is Lenient,
Merciful.

Nearer of kin to the faithful is the Prophet, than they are to their own
selves. His wives are their mothers. According to the Book of God, they
who are related by blood, are nearer the one to the other than other
believers, and than those who have fled their country <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[3](#fn_1113.md) for the cause of God: but whatever
kindness ye shew to your kindred, shall be noted down in the Book.

And remember that we have entered into covenant with the Prophets, and
with thee, and with Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, Son of
Mary: and we formed with them a strict covenant,

That God may question the men of truth as to their truth. <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[4](#fn_1114.md) But a sore torment hath He prepared
for the unbelievers.

O believers! <span id="fr_1115"></span>[5](#fn_1115.md) remember the
goodness of God towards you, when the armies came against you, and we
sent against them a blast, and hosts that ye saw not; for the eye of God
was upon your doings:

When they assailed you from above you, and from below you, <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[6](#fn_1116.md) and when your eyes became distracted,
and your hearts came up into your throat, and ye thought divers thoughts
of God:

Then were the faithful tried, and with strong quaking did they quake:

And when the disaffected and the diseased <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[7](#fn_1117.md) of heart said, "God and his Apostle
have made us but a cheating promise:"

And when a party of them said, "O people of Yathrib! <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[8](#fn_1118.md) there is no place of safety for you
here; <span id="fr_1119"></span>[9](#fn_1119.md) therefore return into the
city." And another party of you asked the prophet's leave to return,
saying, "Our houses are left defenceless." No! they were not left
defenceless: but their sole thought was to flee away.

If the enemy had effected an entry at all points, and they (the
disaffected) had been asked to promote confusion, they would have done
so; but only a short time would they have remained in
it.--(Medina). <span id="fr_1120"></span>[10](#fn_1120.md)

They had before pledged themselves to God that they would not turn their
backs; and a pledge given to God must be enquired of.

SAY: Flight shall not profit you; if ye have fled the death or the
slaughter, yet even then, but a little while shall ye enjoy your good
things!

SAY: Who is he that will screen you from God, whether He choose to bring
evil on you, or to shew you mercy? None beside God shall they find to be
their patron or helper.

God well knoweth those among you who cause hindrances, and those who say
to their brethren, "Come hither to us;" and who come not to the fight
except a little.

It is out of covetousness in your regard: for when an alarm cometh, thou
mayest see them look to thee, and roll their eyes like him on whom the
shadows of death have fallen! Yet, when the alarm is passed, with sharp
tongues will they assail you, covetous of the best of the spoil. No
faith have these! God will make their doings of no avail! And easy is
this with God.

They thought that the CONFEDERATES would never retire: <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[11](#fn_1121.md) and were the confederates to come
again, they would fain be dwelling among the Arabs of the desert, and
there ask news about you! for though they were with you, they fought not
except a little.

A noble pattern had ye in God's Apostle, for all who hope in God, and in
the latter day, and oft remember God!

And when the faithful saw the confederates, they said, "This is what God
and His Apostle promised us, <span id="fr_1122"></span>[12](#fn_1122.md)
and God and His Apostle spoke truly:" and it only increased their faith
and self-devotion.

Some were there among the faithful who made good what they had promised
to God. Some have fulfilled their course, and others await its
fulfilment, and have not been changelings who change--

That God may reward the faithful for their faithfulness, and may punish
the hypocrites, if He so please, or be turned unto them: for God is
Forgiving, Merciful.

And God drove back the infidels in their wrath; they won no advantage;
God sufficed the faithful in the fight: for God is Strong, Mighty!

And He caused those of the people of the Book (the Jews), who had aided
the confederates, to come down out of their fortresses, and cast dismay
into their hearts: some ye slew, others ye took prisoners. <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[13](#fn_1123.md)

And He gave you their land, and their dwellings, and their wealth, for
an heritage--even a land on which ye had never set foot: for the might
of God is equal to all things.

O Prophet! say to thy wives, <span id="fr_1124"></span>[14](#fn_1124.md) If
ye desire this present life and its braveries, come then, I will provide
for you, and dismiss you with an honourable dismissal.

But if ye desire God and His Apostle, and a home in the next life, then,
truly, hath God prepared for those of you who are virtuous, a great
reward.

O wives of the Prophet! should any of you be guilty of a proven
lewdness, doubly shall her chastisement be doubled: and with God this is
easy.

But whoever of you shall obey God and His Apostle, and shall do that
which is right, twice over will we give her her reward, and we have
prepared for her a noble provision.

O wives of the Prophet! ye are not as other women. If ye fear God, be
not too complaisant of speech, lest the man of unhealthy heart should
lust after you, but speak with discreet speech.

And abide still in your houses, and go not in public decked as in the
days of your former ignorance, <span id="fr_1125"></span>[15](#fn_1125.md)
but observe prayer, and pay the impost, and obey God and the Apostle:
for God only desireth to put away filthiness from you <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[16](#fn_1126.md) as his household, and with cleansing
to cleanse you.

And recollect what is rehearsed to you in your houses of the Book of
God, and of wisdom: for God is keen-sighted, cognisant of all.

Truly the men who resign themselves to God (Muslims), and the women who
resign themselves, and the believing men and the believing women, and
the devout men and the devout women, and the men of truth, and the women
of truth, and the patient men and the patient women, and the humble men
and the humble women, and the men who give alms and the women who give
alms, and the men who fast and the women who fast, and the chaste men
and the chaste women, and the men and the women who oft remember God:
for them hath God prepared forgiveness and a rich recompense.

And it is not for a believer, man or woman, to have any choice in their
affairs, when God and His Apostle have decreed a matter: and whoever
disobeyeth God and His Apostle, erreth with palpable error.

And, remember, when thou saidst to him unto whom God had shewn
favour, <span id="fr_1127"></span>[17](#fn_1127.md) and to whom thou also
hadst shewn favour, "Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God;" and thou
didst hide in thy mind what God would bring to light. <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[18](#fn_1128.md) and thou didst fear man; but more
right had it been to fear God. And when Zaid had settled concerning her
to divorce her, we married her to thee, that it might not be a crime in
the faithful to marry the wives of their adopted sons, when they have
settled the affair concerning them. And the behest of God is to be
performed.

No blame attacheth to the prophet where God hath given him a permission.
Such was the way of God with those prophets who flourished before thee;
for God's behest is a fixed decree--

Who fulfilled the mission with which God had charged them, <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[19](#fn_1129.md) and feared Him, and feared none but
God. And God taketh a sufficient account.

Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Apostle
of God, and the seal of the prophets: and God knoweth all things.

O Believers! remember God with frequent remembrance, and praise Him
morning and evening.

He blesseth you, and His angels intercede for you, that He may bring you
forth out of darkness into light: and Merciful is He to the Believers.

Their greeting on the day when they shall meet Him shall be "Peace!" And
He hath got ready for them a noble recompense.

O Prophet ! we have sent thee to be a witness, and a herald of glad
tidings, and a warner;

And one who, through His own permission, summoneth to God, and a
light-giving torch.

Announce, therefore, to believers, that great boons do await them from
God;

And obey not the Infidels and Hypocrites--yet abstain from injuring
them: and put thou thy trust in God, for God is a sufficient guardian.

O Believers! when ye marry believing women, and then divorce them before
ye have consummated the marriage, ye have no term prescribed you, which
ye must fulfil towards them: provide for them, and dismiss them with a
reputable dismissal.

O Prophet! we allow thee thy wives whom thou hast dowered, and the
slaves whom thy right hand possesseth out of the booty which God hath
granted thee, and the daughters of thy uncle, and of thy paternal and
maternal aunts who fled with thee to Medina, and any believing woman who
hath given herself up to the Prophet, if the Prophet desired to wed
her--a Privilege for thee above the rest of the Faithful.

We well know what we have settled for them, in regard to their wives and
to the slaves whom their right hands hold, that there may be no fault on
thy part: <span id="fr_1130"></span>[20](#fn_1130.md) and God is Indulgent,
Merciful!

Thou mayst decline for the present whom thou wilt of them, and thou
mayest take to thy bed her whom thou wilt, and whomsoever thou shalt
long for of those thou shalt have before neglected; and this shall not
be a crime in thee. Thus will it be easier to give them the desire of
their eyes, and not to put them to grief, and to satisfy them with what
thou shalt accord to each of them. God knoweth what is in your hearts,
and God is Knowing, Gracious.

It is not permitted thee to take other wives hereafter, <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[21](#fn_1131.md) nor to change thy present wives for
other women, though their beauty charm thee, except slaves whom thy
right hand shall possess. <span id="fr_1132"></span>[22](#fn_1132.md) And
God watcheth all things.

O Believers! enter not into the houses of the Prophet, <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[23](#fn_1133.md) save by his leave, for a meal,
without waiting his time. When ye are invited then enter, and when ye
have eaten then disperse at once. <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[24](#fn_1134.md) And engage not in familiar talk, for
this would cause the Prophet trouble, and he would be ashamed to bid you
go; but God is not ashamed to say the truth. And when ye would ask any
gift of his wives, ask it from behind a veil. Purer will this be for
your hearts and for their hearts. And ye must not trouble the Apostle of
God, nor marry his wives, after him, for ever. This would be a grave
offence with God.

Whether ye bring a matter to the light or hide it, God truly hath
knowledge of all things.

No blame shall attach to them (your wives) for speaking to their fathers
unveiled, or to their sons, or to their brothers, or to their brothers'
sons, or to their sisters' sons, or to their women, or to the slaves
whom their right hands hold. And fear ye God: for God witnesseth all
things.

Verily, God and His Angels bless the Prophet! Bless ye Him, O Believers,
and salute Him with salutations of Peace.

Verily, they who affront God and His Apostle, the curse of God is on
them in this world, and in the world to come: and He hath prepared for
them a shameful chastisement.

And they who shall affront believing men and believing women, for no
fault of theirs, they shall surely bear the guilt of slander, and of a
clear wrong.

O Prophet! speak to thy wives and to thy daughters, <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[25](#fn_1135.md) and to the wives of the Faithful,
that they let their veils fall low. Thus will they more easily be known,
and they will not be affronted. God is Indulgent, Merciful!

If the Hypocrites, and the men of tainted heart, and the stirrers of
sedition in Medina desist not, we will surely stir thee up against them.
Then shall they not be suffered to dwell near thee therein, but a little
while:

Cursed wherever they are found; they shall be seized and slain with
slaughter!

Such hath been the way of God with those who lived before them; and no
change canst thou find in the way of God.

Men will ask thee of "the Hour." SAY: The knowledge of it is with God
alone: and who can tell thee whether haply the Hour be not nigh at hand?

Verily, God hath cursed the Infidels, and hath got ready for them the
flame:

For aye shall they abide therein; none to befriend them, no helper shall
they find!

On the day when their faces shall be rolled in the fire, they shall cry:
"Oh! would that we had obeyed God, and obeyed the Apostle!"

And they shall say: "Oh our Lord! indeed we obeyed our chiefs and our
great ones, and they misled us from the way of God--

O our Lord! give them a double chastisement, and curse them with a heavy
curse."

O Believers! be not like those who affronted Moses. <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[26](#fn_1136.md) But God cleared him from what they
said of him, and of God was he highly esteemed.

O Believers! fear God, and speak with well-guided speech.

That God may bless your doings for you, and forgive you your sins. And
whoso obeyeth God and His Apostle with great bliss shall be blessed.

Verily, we proposed to the Heavens, and to the Earth, and to the
Mountains to receive the Faith, but they refused the burden, and they
feared to receive it. Man undertook to bear it, but hath proved unjust,
senseless!

Therefore will God punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical
women, and the men and the women who join gods with God; but to the
believing men and women will God turn him: for God is Indulgent,
Merciful!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1111"></span>[1](033.htm#fr_1111.md) Medina was besieged, when
this Sura was revealed, by certain confederate tribes at the instigation
of the Jews, an. Hej. 5. The first nine verses, however, have no
immediate reference to this event, but to Muhammad's cotemporary
marriage with Zeinab. See below, verse 37.

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[2](033.htm#fr_1112.md) The Arabians had been
accustomed, before the time of Muhammad, to divorce their wives with the
words,--thy back be to me as the back of my mother. The drift and motive
of this passage is explained by verse 37 below. It had also been the
custom to hold adopted sons to be as nearly related to them as their
natural ones. See Sura lviii. 2, p. 451.

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[3](033.htm#fr_1113.md) The Mohadjers--those who
had emigrated with Muhammad from Mecca. This verse abrogates Sura
\[xcv.\] viii. 73.

<span id="fn_1114"></span>[4](033.htm#fr_1114.md) How they have discharged
their prophetic functions.

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[5](033.htm#fr_1115.md) Verses 9-33 have
reference to the events of the year Hej. 5, towards the close. See next
note. His. 688; Waq. 4 f.

<span id="fn_1116"></span>[6](033.htm#fr_1116.md) In the engagement which
took place under the walls of Medina, some of the enemy were posted on a
height to the east of the city, others in a valley on the west. The
besiegers were 12,000, the Muslims 3,000 strong, when a violent storm,
which upset the tents, put out the camp fires, and blinded the eyes of
the confederates with sand, turned the scale of victory against them.
Muhammad ascribes the storm to angelic agency.

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[7](033.htm#fr_1117.md) That is, with infidelity.

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[8](033.htm#fr_1118.md) The ancient name of
El-Medina.

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[9](033.htm#fr_1119.md) In the trenches which had
been dug around the city by the advice of Salmân, the Persian.

<span id="fn_1120"></span>[10](033.htm#fr_1120.md) They would speedily have
quitted the city to attack the faithful in the trenches.

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[11](033.htm#fr_1121.md) That is, raise the
siege.

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[12](033.htm#fr_1122.md) That is, that through
trials we should attain to Paradise, v. 29.

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[13](033.htm#fr_1123.md) After the siege of
Medina had been raised, Muhammad made a successful expedition against
the Jews of Koreidha, for their treason and violation of treaties.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[14](033.htm#fr_1124.md) Muhammad's wives having
caused him much annoyance by demands of rich dresses, etc., he gave them
the choice of continuing with him as before, or of divorce. They chose
the former. See Abulfeda's Hist. Moh. p. 77, and Gagnier's Vie de Moh.
i. 4, chap. ii.

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[15](033.htm#fr_1125.md) That is, Idolatry. Acts
xvii. 30. Freytag (Einl. p. 453) thinks that previous to Islam, the
Arabian women went in public unveiled.

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[16](033.htm#fr_1126.md) The pronoun is in the
pl. masc., whereas the pl. fem. is used in the previous part of the
verse. The partisans of Ali quote this passage to prove the intimate
union of Ali and his posterity with the Prophet.

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[17](033.htm#fr_1127.md) That is, to Zaid. The
favour of God to Zaid consisted in having caused him to become a Muslim:
the favour of Muhammad in adopting him as his son. Zaid and Abu Lahab
(Sura cxi. p. 29) are the only contemporaries of Muhammad mentioned by
name in the Koran.

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[18](033.htm#fr_1128.md) Thy plan to obtain
Zeinab, or Zenobia, Zaid's wife, as thy wife.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[19](033.htm#fr_1129.md) Lit, who brought the
messages of God.

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[20](033.htm#fr_1130.md) If thou makest use of
the special prerogative (conferred in verse 49).

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[21](033.htm#fr_1131.md) He had nine wives at
this period, beside slaves. The number of wives allowed to the faithful
is four. See note, p. 411.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[22](033.htm#fr_1132.md) The first slave whom
Muhammad took to wife was Raihana, at the conquest of the Banu Koreidha.
His. 693. Weil, 170.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[23](033.htm#fr_1133.md) Verses 53-55 refer to
the conduct of the guests at Muhammad's house after his marriage with
Zeinab. Albuhari passim. Muslim i. 824 ff. Wah. Comp. Caussir, iii. 151.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[24](033.htm#fr_1134.md) Ullmann, p. 263, quotes
a similar precept from the Talmud, "Do all that the master of the house
biddeth, but wait not to be asked to depart."

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[25](033.htm#fr_1135.md) This verse cannot be of
later date than Hej. 8, when Muhammad's daughter Omm Kulthum died.
leaving only Fatima.

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[26](033.htm#fr_1136.md) This may refer to the
charge of adultery said by the Rabbins to have been brought by Korah
against Moses. Comp. Tr. Sanhedrin, fol. 110a. and Numbers xii. 1. The
verse is said to have been revealed on account of aspersions thrown on
Muhammad for unfairly dividing spoils, whereupon he said, "God be
merciful to my brother Moses. He was wronged more than this, and bore it
with patience."
