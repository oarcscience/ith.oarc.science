### SURA XC.--THE SOIL \[XVIII.\]

MECCA.--20 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
I NEED not to swear by this SOIL,  
This soil on which thou dost dwell,  
Or by sire and offspring! <span id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57)  
Surely in trouble have we created man.  
What! thinketh he that no one hath power over him?  
"I have wasted," saith he, "enormous riches!"  
What! thinketh he that no one regardeth him?  
What! have we not made him eyes,  
And tongue, and lips,  
And guided him to the two highways? <span
id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58)  
Yet he attempted not the steep.  
And who shall teach thee what the steep is?  
It is to ransom the captive, <span id="fr_59"></span>[3](#fn_59)  
Or to feed in the day of famine,  
The orphan who is near of kin, or the poor that lieth in the dust;  
Beside this, to be of those who believe, and enjoin stedfastness on each
other, and enjoin compassion on each other.  
These shall be the people of the right hand:  
While they who disbelieve our signs,  
Shall be the people of the left.  
Around them the fire shall close.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[1](090.htm#fr_57) Lit. and begetter and what he
hath begotten.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[2](090.htm#fr_58) Of good and evil.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[3](090.htm#fr_59) Thus we read in Hilchoth
Matt'noth Aniim, c. 8, "The ransoming of captives takes precedence of
the feeding and clothing of the poor, and there is no commandment so
great as this."
