### SURA LXII.--THE ASSEMBLY \[XCIV.\]

MEDINA.--11 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

ALL that is in the Heavens, and all that is on the Earth, uttereth the
Praise of God, the King! the Holy! the Mighty! the Wise!

It is He who hath sent to the pagan folk (Arabs) an Apostle from among
themselves, to rehearse His signs to them, and to purify them, and to
impart to them a knowledge of "the Book" and wisdom; for aforetime were
they in manifest error.

And others among them have not yet overtaken those who preceded them in
the faith. But He is the Mighty, the Wise!

This is the goodness of God: He bestoweth it on whom He will: God is of
immense goodness!

They on whom the burden of the law was laid, and would not bear it, are
like an ass beneath a load of books. A sorry likeness this, for the
people who give the lie to the signs of God! God guideth not the people
who do this wrong!

SAY: O ye Jews, if ye profess that ye rather than other men are the
friends of God, then wish for death if ye are men of truth.

But never on account of their previous handywork will they wish for it,
and God knoweth the wrong doers.

SAY: Verily the death from which ye flee will surely meet you. Then
shall ye be brought back to Him who knoweth alike the things done in
secret and openly: and He will tell you of your actions.

O ye who believe! When ye are summoned to prayer on the day of THE
ASSEMBLY, <span id="fr_964"></span>[1](#fn_964.md) haste to the
commemoration of God, and quit your traffic. This, if ye knew it, will
be best for you.

And when the Prayer is ended, then disperse yourselves abroad and go in
quest of the bounties of God; and, that it may be well with you, oft
remember God.

But when they get a sight of merchandise or sport, they disperse after
it, and leave thee standing alone. <span id="fr_965"></span>[2](#fn_965.md)
SAY: God hath in reserve what is better than sport or wares. And God is
the best provider!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_964"></span>[1](062.htm#fr_964.md) Friday; the day on which
Muhammad made his first entry into Medina, and the day on which creation
was finished.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[2](062.htm#fr_965.md) It is said that when
Muhammad was preaching, Dahya Alkalbi, while yet a heathen, came, on a
Friday, into Medina at the head of a caravan, and that all the
congregation, attracted by the music of the tambours which preceded it,
left the sermon for the spectacle. Muquâtil ap. Alfarrâ. If this account
be accurate, we may approximate to the date of this Sura as in Hej. 5
(towards the close). Dahya is known to have fought in the ranks of the
Muslims at the battle of the Ditch. And as the former part is aimed at
the Jews, it is probably of the same period as Sura \[xci.\] ii.
