### SURA CXI. ABU LAHAB \[XI.\]

MECCA. 5 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
LET the hands of ABU LAHAB <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md)
perish,and let himself perish!  
His wealth and his gains shall avail him not.  
Burned shall he be at the fiery flame, <span
id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46.md)  
And his wife laden with fire wood,--  
On her neck a rope of palm fibre.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_45"></span>[1](111.htm#fr_45.md) Undoubtedly one of the
earliest Suras, and refers to the rejection of Muhammad's claim to the
prophetic office by his uncle, Abu Lahab, at the instigation of his
wife, Omm Djemil, who is said to have strewn the path of Muhammad on one
occasion with thorns. The following six Suras, like the two first, have
special reference to the difficulties which the Prophet met with the
outset of his career, especially from the rich.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[2](111.htm#fr_46.md) In allusion to the meaning of
Abu Lahab, father of flame.
