### SURA XLIV.--SMOKE \[LIII.\]

MECCA.--59 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
Ha. Mim. <span id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_194.md) By this clear Book!  
See! on a blessed night <span id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_195.md) have we
sent it down, for we would warn mankind:  
On the night wherein all things are disposed in wisdom, <span
id="fr_196"></span>[3](#fn_196.md)  
By virtue of our behest. Lo! we have ever sent forth Apostles,  
A mercy from thy Lord: he truly heareth and knoweth all things--  
Lord of the Heavens and of the Earth and of all that is between
them,--if ye be firm in faith--  
There is no God but He!--He maketh alive and killeth!--Your Lord and the
Lord of your sires of old!  
Yet with doubts do they disport them.  
But mark them on the day when the Heaven shall give out a palpable
SMOKE,  
Which shall enshroud mankind: this will be an afflictive torment.  
They will cry, "Our Lord! relieve us from this torment: see! we are
believers."  
But how did warning avail them, when an undoubted apostle had come to
them;  
And they turned their backs on him, and said, "Taught by others,
possessed?"  
Were we to relieve you from the plague even a little, ye would certainly
relapse. <span id="fr_197"></span>[4](#fn_197.md)  
On the day when we shall fiercely put forth our great fierceness, we
will surely take vengeance on them!  
Of old, before their time, had we proved the people of Pharaoh, when a
noble apostle presented himself to them.  
"Send away with me," cried he, "the servants of God; for I am an apostle
worthy of all credit:  
And exalt not yourselves against God, for I come to you with undoubted
power;  
And I take refuge with Him who is my Lord and your Lord, that ye stone
me not:  
And if ye believe me not, at least separate yourselves from me."  
And he cried to his Lord, "That these are a wicked people."  
"March forth then, said God, with my servants by night, for ye will be
pursued.  
And leave behind you the cleft sea: they are a drowned host."  
How many a garden and fountain did they quit!  
And corn fields and noble dwellings!  
And pleasures in which they rejoiced them!  
So was it: and we gave them as a heritage to another people.  
Nor Heaven nor Earth wept for them, nor was their sentence respited;  
And we rescued the children of Israel from a degrading affliction--  
From Pharaoh, for he was haughty, given to excess.  
And we chose them, in our prescience, above all peoples, <span
id="fr_198"></span>[5](#fn_198.md)  
And we shewed them miracles wherein was their clear trial.  
Yet these infidels say,  
"There is but our first death, neither shall we be raised again:  
Bring back our sires, if ye be men of truth."  
Are they better than the people of Tobba, <span
id="fr_199"></span>[6](#fn_199.md)  
And those who flourished before them whom we destroyed for their evil
deeds?  
We have not created the Heavens and the Earth and whatever is between
them in sport:  
We have not created them but for a serious end: <span
id="fr_200"></span>[7](#fn_200.md) but the greater part of them understand
it not.  
Verily the day of severing <span id="fr_201"></span>[8](#fn_201.md) shall
be the appointed time of all:  
A day when the master shall not at all be aided by the servant, neither
shall they be helped;  
Save those on whom God shall have mercy: for He is the mighty, the
merciful.  
Verily the tree of Ez-Zakkoum <span id="fr_202"></span>[9](#fn_202.md)  
Shall be the sinner's <span id="fr_203"></span>[10](#fn_203.md) food:  
Like dregs of oil shall it boil up in their bellies,  
Like the boiling of scalding water.  
"--Seize ye him, and drag him into the mid-fire;  
Then pour on his head of the tormenting boiling water.  
--'Taste this:' for thou forsooth art the mighty, the honourable!  
Lo! this is that of which ye doubted."  
But the pious shall be in a secure place,  
Amid gardens and fountains,  
Clothed in silk and richest robes, facing one another:  
Thus shall it be: and we will wed them to the virgins with large dark
eyes:  
Therein shall they call, secure, for every kind of fruit;  
Therein, their first death passed, shall they taste death no more; and
He shall keep them from the pains of Hell:--  
'Tis the gracious bounty of thy Lord! This is the great felicity.  
We have made this Koran easy for thee in thine own tongue, that they may
take the warning.  
Therefore wait thou, for they are waiting. <span
