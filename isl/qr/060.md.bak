### SURA <span id="fr_1194"></span>[1](#fn_1194.md) LX.--SHE WHO IS TRIED \[CX.\]

MEDINA.--13 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

O YE who believe! take not my foe <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[2](#fn_1195.md) and your foe for friends, shewing them
kindness, although they believe not that truth which hath come to you:
they drive forth the Apostles and yourselves because ye believe in God
your Lord! If ye go forth to fight on my way, and from a desire to
please me, and shew them kindness in private, I well know what ye
conceal, and what ye discover! Whoso doth this hath already gone astray
from the even way.

If they meet with you they will prove your foes: hand and tongue will
they put forth for your hurt, and will desire that you become infidels
again.

Neither your kindred nor your children shall at all avail you on the day
of the resurrection. A severance between you will it make! and your
actions doth God behold.

A good example had ye in Abraham, <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[3](#fn_1196.md) and in those who followed him, when
they said to their people, "Verily, we are clear of you, and of what ye
worship beside God: we renounce you: and between us and hath hatred and
enmity sprung up for ever, until ye believe in God alone." Yet imitate
not the language of Abraham to his Father, "I will pray for thy
forgiveness, but not aught shall I obtain for thee from God." <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[4](#fn_1197.md) O our Lord! in thee do we trust! to
thee do we turn! to thee we shall come back at the last.

O our Lord! expose us not for trial to the unbelievers, and forgive us:
for thou art the Mighty, the Wise!

A good example had ye in them, for all who hope in God and in the last
day. But let who will turn back, God truly is the Rich, the
Praiseworthy!

God will, perhaps, establish good will between yourselves and those of
them whom ye take to be your enemies: <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[5](#fn_1198.md) God is Powerful: and God is Gracious,
Merciful.

God doth not forbid you to deal with kindness and fairness toward those
who have not made war upon you on account of your religion, or driven
you forth from your homes: for God loveth those who act with
fairness.&gt;Only doth God forbid you to make friends of those who, on
account of your religion, have warred against you, and have driven you
forth from your homes, and have aided those who drove you forth: and
whoever maketh friends of them are wrong- doers.

O Believers! <span id="fr_1199"></span>[6](#fn_1199.md) when believing
women come over to you as refugees (Mohadjers), then make TRIAL of them.
God best knoweth their faith; but if ye have also ascertained their
faith, let them not go back to the infidels; they are not lawful for
them, nor are the unbelievers lawful for these women. But give them back
what they have spent for their dowers. No crime shall it be in you to
marry them, provided ye give them their dowers. Do not retain any right
in the infidel women, but demand back what you have spent for their
dowers, and let the unbelievers demand back what they have spent for
their wives. <span id="fr_1200"></span>[7](#fn_1200.md) This is the
ordinance of God which He ordaineth among you: and God is Knowing, Wise.

And if any of your wives escape from you to the Infidels from whom ye
afterwards take any spoil, then give to those whose wives shall have
fled away, the like of what they shall have spent for their dowers; and
fear God in whom ye believe.

O Prophet! when believing women come to thee, and pledge themselves that
they will not associate aught with God, and that they will not steal or
commit adultery, nor kill their children, nor bring scandalous
charges, <span id="fr_1201"></span>[8](#fn_1201.md) nor disobey thee in
what is right, then plight thou thy faith to them, and ask pardon for
them of God: for God is Indulgent, Merciful!

O Believers! enter not into amity with those against whom God is
angered; they despair of the life to come, even as the Infidels despair
of the inmates of the tombs.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1194"></span>[1](060.htm#fr_1194.md) Revealed probably as far
as verse 9 (Ramadhan Hej. 8) shortly before the taking of Mecca.

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[2](060.htm#fr_1195) Haleb (?.md) Ben Abu Baltaa
had informed the Koreisch of an intended surprise of Mecca on the part
of Muhammad, with the view of making terms for his own family who had
been left there. The offence was pardoned, but the revelation was
nevertheless published with the view of preventing similar acts of
treachery in future.

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[3](060.htm#fr_1196.md) Speaking of the
representatives of the different religious systems prevalent in the
Roman Empire, as Orpheus, Abraham, Christ, Apollonius of Tyana,
enshrined among the household deities of Alexander Severus, Mr. Milman
remarks (Hist. of Christianity, ii. p. 231) that "It is singular that
Abraham, rather than Moses, was placed at the head of Judaism: it is
possible that the traditionary sanctity which attached to the first
parent of the Jewish people, and of many of the Arab tribes, and which
was afterwards embodied in the Koran, was floating in the East, and
would comprehend, as it were, the opinions, not only of the Jews, but of
a much wider circle of the Syrian natives."

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[4](060.htm#fr_1197.md) Sura \[cxiii.\] ix. 115.

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[5](060.htm#fr_1198.md) That is, by their
conversion hereafter.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[6](060.htm#fr_1199) Said (see Nöld. p. 163.md)
to have been revealed at, or shortly after, the peace of Hudaibiya.
According to the terms then agreed upon, a mutual restitution of
property was to take place.

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[7](060.htm#fr_1200.md) Who are converted to
Islam.

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[8](060.htm#fr_1201.md) Lit. with a calumny which
they have devised between their hands and their feet. Said to have been
revealed at the taking of Mecca. Tab. Beidh.
