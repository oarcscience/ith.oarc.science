### SURA XLIX.--THE APARTMENTS \[CXII.\]

MEDINA.--18 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

O BELIEVERS! enter not upon any affair ere God and His Apostle <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1](#fn_1203.md) permit you; and fear ye God: for God
Heareth, Knoweth. <span id="fr_1204"></span>[2](#fn_1204.md)

O Believers! raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet,
neither speak loud to him as ye speak loud one to another, lest your
works come to nought, and ye unaware of it.

They who lower their voices in the presence of the Apostle of God, are
the persons whose hearts God hath inclined to piety. Forgiveness shall
be theirs and a rich reward.

They who call out to thee while thou art within <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[3](#fn_1205.md) thine APARTMENTS, have most of them no
right perception of what is due to thee.

But if they wait patiently till thou come forth to them, it were far
better for them. But God is Indulgent, Merciful.

O Believers! if any bad man <span id="fr_1206"></span>[4](#fn_1206.md) come
to you with news, clear it up at once, lest through ignorance ye harm
others, and speedily have to repent of what ye have done.

And know that an Apostle of God is among you! should he give way to you
in many matters ye would certainly become guilty of a crime. But God
hath endeared the faith to you, and hath given it favour in your hearts,
and hath made unbelief, and wickedness, and disobedience hateful to you.
Such are they who pursue a right course.

Through the bounty and grace which is from God: and God is Knowing,
Wise.

If two bodies of the faithful are at war, then make ye peace between
them: <span id="fr_1207"></span>[5](#fn_1207.md) and if the one of them
wrong the other, fight against that party which doth the wrong, until
they come back to the precepts of God: if they come back, make peace
between them with fairness, and act impartially; God loveth those who
act with impartiality.

Only the faithful are brethren; wherefore make peace between your
brethren; and fear God, that ye may obtain mercy.

O Believers! let not men laugh men to scorn who haply may be better than
themselves; neither let women laugh women to scorn who may haply be
better than themselves! <span id="fr_1208"></span>[6](#fn_1208.md) Neither
defame one another, nor call one another by nicknames. Bad is it to be
called wicked after having professed the faith: <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[7](#fn_1209.md) and whoso repent not of this are doers
of wrong.

O Believers! avoid frequent suspicions, for some suspicions are a crime;
and pry not: neither let the one of you traduce another in his absence.
Would any one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Surely
ye would loathe it. And fear ye God: for God is Ready to turn, Merciful.

O men! verily, we have created you of a male and a female; and we have
divided you into peoples and tribes that ye might have knowledge one of
another. Truly, the most worthy of honour in the sight of God is he who
feareth Him most. <span id="fr_1210"></span>[8](#fn_1210.md) Verily, God is
Knowing, Cognisant.

The Arabs of the desert <span id="fr_1211"></span>[9](#fn_1211.md) say, "We
believe." Say thou: Ye believe not; but rather say, "We profess Islam;"
for the faith hath not yet found its way into your hearts. But if ye
obey God and His Apostle, he will not allow you to lose any of your
actions: for God is Indulgent, Merciful.

The true believers are those only who believe in God and His Apostle,
and afterwards doubt not; and who contend with their substance and their
persons on the path of God. These are the sincere.

SAY: Will ye teach God about your religion? when God knoweth whatever is
in the Heavens and on the Earth: yea, God hath knowledge of all things.

They taunt thee with their having embraced Islam. <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[10](#fn_1212.md) SAY: Taunt me not with your having
embraced Islam: God rather taunteth you with His having guided you to
the faith: acknowledge this if ye are sincere.

Verily, God knoweth the secrets of the Heavens and of the Earth: and God
beholdeth what ye do.

<span id="fn_1203"></span>[1](049.htm#fr_1203.md) Or anticipate not, take
not the lead of God and His Apostle.

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[2](049.htm#fr_1204.md) All the ancient
Interpreters (as His. 933 ff., Ibn Sa'd. 320, Tab. Agâní. 116 f.--comp.
also Weil 244 ff., Caussin, iii. 271) refer from 1-5 to the
disrespectful demeanour, in Muhammad's presence, of the envoys of the
Banu Tamim in Hej. 9 or 10.

<span id="fn_1205"></span>[3](049.htm#fr_1205.md) Lit. from without.

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[4](049.htm#fr_1206.md) The commentators
mentioned in the last note, as well as others, explain this verse of Al
Walid ben Uqba, who had brought a false report of the refusal of the
Banu'lmustaliq to pay certain alms which Muhammad had sent him to
demand. This Al Walid became governor of Kufa under Othman. He probably
was never really converted to Islam.

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[5](049.htm#fr_1207.md) Upon this passage 91-2,
die Muslimen, says Nöldeke, verschiedene Geschichten erzählen, so dass
sich Nichts sicher bestimmen Iässt, p. 164. This remark applies to the
great mass of Muhammadan comment.

wickedness, after faith.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[8](049.htm#fr_1210.md) That is, not the most
nobly born, like the Koreisch. This verse is said to have been revealed
in Mecca on the day of its conquest. See Weil, Leben, p.372, and n.

<span id="fn_1211"></span>[9](049.htm#fr_1211.md) The Banû Asad had come to
Medina in a year of famine to seek support for themselves and families,

had conferred a favour on the Prophet.
