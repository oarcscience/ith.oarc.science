### SURA CV.--THE ELEPHANT \[XIX.\]

MECCA.--5 Verses

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful  
HAST thou not seen <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60) how thy Lord
dealt with the army of the ELEPHANT?  
Did he not cause their stratagem to miscarry?  
And he sent against them birds in flocks (ababils),  
Claystones did they hurl down upon them,  
And he made them like stubble eaten down!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_60"></span>[1](105.htm#fr_60) This Sura is probably
Muhammad's appeal to the Meccans, intended at the same time for his own
encouragement, on the ground of their deliverance from the army of
Abraha, the Christian King of Abyssinia and Arabia Felix, said to have
been lost in the year of Muhammad's birth in an expedition against Mecca
for the purpose of destroying the Caaba. This army was cut off by
small-pox (Wakidi; Hishami), and there is no doubt, as the Arabic word
for small-pox also means "small stones," in reference to the hard
gravelly feeling of the pustules, what is the true interpretation of the
fourth line of this Sura, which, like many other poetical passages in
the Koran, has formed the starting point for the most puerile and
extravagant legends. Vide Gibbon's Decline and Fall, c. 1. The small-pox
first shewed itself in Arabia at the time of the invasion by Abraha. M.
