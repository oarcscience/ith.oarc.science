<p>In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br> BY the NIGHT when she spreads her veil;<br> By the Day when it brightly shineth;<br> By Him who made male and female;<br> At different ends truly do ye aim!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> But as to him who giveth alms and feareth God,<br> And yieldeth assent to the Good;<br> To him will we make easy the path to happiness.<br> But as to him who is covetous and bent on riches,<br> And calleth the Good a lie,<br> To him will we make easy the path to misery:<br> And what shall his wealth avail him when he goeth down?<br> Truly man&#8217;s guidance is with Us<br> And Our&#8217;s, the Future and the Past.<br> I warn you therefore of the flaming fire;<br> None shall be cast to it but the most wretched,--<br> Who hath called the truth a lie and turned his back.<br> But the God-fearing shall escape it,--<br> Who giveth away his substance that he may become pure;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> And who offereth not favours to any one for the sake of recompense,<br> But only as seeking the face of his Lord the Most High.<br> And surely in the end he shall be well content.</p>
