<P><A NAME="fn_72"></A><A HREF="085.htm#fr_72">1</A> Lit. By the Heaven furnished with towers, where the angels keep watch; also, the signs of the Zodiac: this is the usual interpretation. See Sura xv. 15.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_73"></A><A HREF="085.htm#fr_73">2</A> That is, by Muhammad and by Islam; or, angels and men. See, however, v. 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_74"></A><A HREF="085.htm#fr_74">3</A> Prepared by Dhu Nowas, King of Yemen, A.D. 523, for the Christians. See Gibbon's Decline and Fall, chap. xii. towards the end. Pocock Sp. Hist. Ar. p. 62. And thus the comm. generally. But Geiger (p. 192) and N&ouml;ldeke (p. 77 n.) understand the passage of Dan. iii. But it should be borne in mind that the Suras of this early period contain very little allusion to Jewish or Christian legends.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_75"></A><A HREF="085.htm#fr_75">4</A> Verses 8-11 wear the appearance of a late insertion, on account of their length, which is a characteristic of the more advanced period. Observe also the change in the rhymes.</P>
