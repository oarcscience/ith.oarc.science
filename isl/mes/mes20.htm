<p>Strive not then, man of sense; except good name to leave.<br> Exertion's a delusion. Out! Thou sottish knave!"</p>  
<p>A simpleton one morning rushing came in haste,<br> Where Solomon his court of justice then had placed.<br> His cheeks were blanched, his lips were blue; effects of fright.<br> Said Solomon to him: "What ails thee? Say aright."<br> Him answer&#8217;d that poor wretch: "The angel, Lord, of death,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> Upon me fixed, just now, a look that stopped my breath." <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_60">60</A></FONT></span><br> Said Solomon: "What wilt thou I should do for thee?"<br> He answered: "That the wind may now commanded be&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> To carry me away forthwith to Hind&#363;st&#257;n.<br> Perchance by fleeing thither, save my life I can."</p>  
<p>See how mankind do shun the garb of poverty.<br> Hence they're a prey to greed and dire necessity.<br> This fear of poverty is like that man's dismay,<br> Its Hind&#363;st&#257;n, remark, is greed and grasping's sway.</p>  
<p>So Solomon the wind commanded, him, forthwith,<br> To bear to Hind&#363;st&#257;n; and land him near some frith. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_65">65</A></FONT></span></p>  
<p>Another day as Solomon his court did hold,<br> Death's angel came; the king to him the matter told:<br> "Thy wrathful look, the other day, upon that man,<br> Has driven him his home to quit for Hind&#363;st&#257;n.<br> Didst thou in wrath survey the pious man that way,<br> That he might wander forth a waif, like sheep astray?<br> Or was thy look's intent, so dreadful to behold,<br> His soul to separate from its corporeal fold?"</p>  
<p>To him replied the angel: "King of sprites and men!<br> His fancy him misled; he'll ne&#8217;er do so again. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_70">70</A></FONT></span></p>

<p>&#8217;Twas not in anger then that I did look on him;<br> &#8217;Twas wonder him to see here, looking hale and prim.<br> For God had me commanded: 'Go this very day,<br> And take his soul in Hind&#363;st&#257;n, his debt to pay.'<br> In wonder, then, I said within myself: 'Had he<br> A hundred wings, in Hind&#363;st&#257;n he could not be.'<br> But going, still, by God's command, to Hind&#363;st&#257;n,<br> Him there I found, and took his soul with my own hand."</p>

Reflect. &#8217;Twas written ere his birth.<br> From whom to flee? From self? Oh! That's absurd!<br> From whom to steal? From God? Worse, worse! No word!</p>  
<p>The lion now remarked: "The words you speak are true.<br> But just consider how the prophets, saints, ensue.<br> What they have wrought hath God blessed, made to prosper still;<br> Their joys and griefs, their sufferings, pains, were by His will.<br> Their stratagems dictated by their God were, all.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> 'Who comes of gentle blood, will gentle words let fall.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> Their traps have taken angels with the baits they placed.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_80">80</A></FONT></span> Their seeming slips and faults were all by wisdom traced.<br> Exert thyself, O man; put shoulder to the wheel,<br> The prophets and the saints to imitate in zeal.<br> Exertion's not a struggle against Providence.<br> &#8217;Twas Providence enjoined it,&#8212;made it our defence.<br> Blasphemer may I be, if ever single man<br> Bestowed in vain one effort to fulfil God's plan.<br> Thou hast no broken bones; why bind thy limbs in splints?<br> Have patience yet awhile; then laugh; we're not mere flints.</p>

Unmindful of our God to be;<br> Not gold or silver, wife or children, things we see.<br> The wealth we hold at service of our God is blest.<br> 'The riches of the just are pure,' Ahmed confess&#8217;d. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_90">90</A></FONT></span><br> The water from a leak is danger to a ship;<br> The sea beneath her keel is just what makes her skip.<br> Great Solomon despised wealth, sway, with all his heart.<br> With countless treasures poor he named himself.

<p>Of this complexion, many proofs the lion brought;<br> No answer those compulsionists in dispute sought.<br> The fox, the deer, the hare, and eke the sly jackal,<br> Were fain to quit compulsion's cause, for good and all.</p>

<p>But lo, at length the lot upon the hare did light.<br> He found it very hard, and wailed his awful plight.<br> The other beasts remarked: "We each have had our turn;<br> And none of us refused th&#8217; agreement to confirm.<br> By breach of faith on us fresh infamy bring not.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_105">105</A></FONT></span> Begone forthwith; the lion must not be forgot."</p>  
<p>The hare replied: "Dear friends, a respite to me grant.<br> A stratagem I'll plan, and cheat this grim tyrant.<br> My wily plan shall save the souls of all alive;<br> And safety heirloom be your children shall derive.<br> Thus every prophet's promised to his sect, at least,<br> Salvation from the doom o&#8217;erhanging man and beast.<br> They found a ready way to &#8217;scape beyond the spheres,<br> So soon as to reflect they turned their minds from fears.<br> Man sees another's eye is but a wee, wee thing;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_110">110</A></FONT></span> He knows how great a service can th&#8217; eye's pupil bring."</p>
