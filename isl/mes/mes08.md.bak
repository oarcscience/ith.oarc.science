### CHAPTER V.

*Sheykh Salāhu-’d-Dīn* <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) *Ferīdūn,
surnamed Zer-Kūb* (*Goldbeater*).

### 1.

<span class="smallcaps">Sheykh Salāhu-’d-Dīn</span> was originally a
fellow-disciple with Jelāl, as pupils to Seyyid Burhānu-’d-Dīn. He
afterwards became a goldbeater, as his parents were poor.

After a while, when Jelāl's reputation became great, Salāh went and paid
him his respects. Jelāl knew how highly Burhān had esteemed Salāh, when
his pupil. He therefore received him in a very friendly manner, and
their intercourse became warmly renewed.

One day, after the murder of Shemsu-’d-Dīn, and the return of Jelāl from
Damascus, he sent for Salāh, and appointed him his own assistant in the
government and instruction of the disciples, presenting him also to the
king in that capacity.

#### 2.

Jelāl's first royal protector, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn Keyqubād, was now dead, and
his son, Gayāsu-’d-Dīn Key-Khusrev, reigned in his stead.

The monarch one day made a feast in the vineyards, and went forth into
the fields for a walk, alone. He picked up a young snake, carried it
indoors, placed it in a gold box, sealed this up, and then rejoined his
courtiers.

To those attendants the king exhibited the sealed packet, as having just
then been privately received from the Qaysar <span
id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_26.md)

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

of Constantinople with a message to this effect: "If your religion of
Islām be the true faith, some one of your wise men will be able to see
into this packet without breaking its seals, and to tell what it
contains."

The king then called upon his ministers to prove their loyalty to him,
and their faithfulness to their religion, by solving this riddle. None
of them was able.

The packet was now sent round in succession to all the eminent teachers
and theologians of the city; but none could unravel the enigma.

At last it was brought to Jelāl, as Sheykh Ferīdūn and he were sitting
together. Jelāl invited Ferīdūn to tell them the contents of the packet;
and he immediately replied: "It is not a dignified act in the king to
imprison a young snake in a gold box, sealing this up as a packet, and
then tempting his courtiers, ministers, and learned men with a false
pretence. A saint, however, knows not only the solution of so paltry a
trick as this, but is also aware of every thought in the king's heart,
and every secret of earth and heaven."

When this answer was reported to the king, he came to the college, and
professed himself a disciple, remarking: "If the disciples of
Shemsu-’d-Dīn possess such power, and work such miracles, how great must
have been the sanctity of the murdered martyr."

Ferīdūn acted for ten years as assistant to Jelāl.

#### 3.

Fātima, the daughter of Sheykh Salāhu-’d-Dīn Ferīdūn, was married to
Sultan Veled, Jelāl's son. Jelāl used to teach her to read the Qur’ān
and other books.

Jelāl used to call Fātima his *right eye;* her sister Hediyya, *his left
eye;* and their mother, Latīfa Khātūn, *the personification of God's
grace*.

When Fātima's marriage was solemnised, all the angels of heaven were
present, and wished the young couple all happiness.

She was a saint, and continually worked miracles. She fasted by day and
watched by night, tasting food only once in three days. She was very
charitable to the poor, the orphans, and the widows, distributing to
them food and raiment.

Sheykh Ferīdūn died on New Year's Day, <span
class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 657 (28th December, <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1258).
