<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">There</span> was a scribe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, before &#8216;Uthm&#257;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> had filled that post,<br> Most diligent in noting revelation's host.<br> Whatever text the Prophet had to promulgate<br> On parchment did this scribe trace all its terms of fate.</p>  
<p>The splendour of those inspirations filled his soul.<br> His mind became enlightened, as a glowing coal.<br> The substance of that wisdom from the Prophet came.<br> The silly scribe imagined &#8217;twas his genius&#8217; flame:<br> "The texts the Prophet promulgates with rare effect,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span> Appear <i>verbatim</i> in my mind, without defect."</p>  
<p>The Prophet was aware of this egregious sin.<br> The wrath of God descended from high heaven's welkin.<br> The scribe renounced his office, and his faith at once.<br> Religion's fiercest foe he stood now, for the nonce.<br> The Prophet questioned him: "Benighted, wretched man!<br> If light there be in thee, whence this thy darkest plan?<br> Hadst thou a fountain of God's truth been, verily,<br> This turbid stream had never flowed thence, heavily."</p>  
<p>Not caring to expose his scribe to all his friends,<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_10">10</A></FONT></span> The Prophet held his peace, to watch th&#8217; adventure's ends.</p>

<p>The scribe's heart hardened more and more as time rolled on.<br> Repentance he felt not; his pride grew thereupon.<br> He sighed. His sighs were not the signs of contrite heart;<br> But tokens sure that justice made him feel its smart.<br> God caused his pride to weigh more heavy than a chain.<br> How many thus are fettered; none can heal their pain.<br> His blasphemy and pride held him in iron grip;<br> His very sighs he felt constrained to stifle on his lip.<br> He cried: "'The iron collars they're compelled to wear;'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> There's naught but iron collars; these are all we bear! <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span><br> 'Behind them is a barrier; but We've bound their eyes,'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><br> So that they see not what's before, behind those ties."</p>  
<p>The barrier so upreared appears a level plain;<br> He knows not &#8217;tis a bourn that checks him like a chain.<br> Thy witness is a barrier, bars sight of the Lord;<br> Thy teacher is a veil, shuts out God's holy word.<br> How many infidels, oh! long faith to possess!<br> Their pride, their honour, stands between them and success.<br> That barrier, unseen, &#8217;s than iron firmer still.<br> An axe can hew through iron; not through stubborn will. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_20">20</A></FONT></span><br> A bond of iron may be broken by due means;<br> A moral bond is what holds firmest, where it leans.</p>  
<p>A bee, a wasp, may sting one to the very quick;<br> Yet may the same be warded by precaution's trick.<br> But what's to do when sting is in our very selves?<br> The pain is then most biting, deeper far it delves.<br> Unwillingly has leaped this subject from my mind.<br> I fear &#8217;twill leave despair in many, deep behind.<br> Despair thou not; take consolation to thy soul;<br> And cry to that Deliverer who can make thee whole: <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_25">25</A></FONT></span><br> "Thou Lover of forgiveness!

<p>The sins of all mankind were known to them as sure;<br> No wickedness escapes the glance of spirits pure.<br> In anger at such baseness they were moved to scorn;<br> Their own defect was hidden from their sight, heaven-born.</p>  
<p>An ugly man once saw his face in looking-glass.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_120">120</A></FONT></span> He turned away enraged with that reflecting mass.<br> So, when one self-conceited sees another's fault,<br> A flame from hell is lighted in his bad heart's vault.<br> &#8217;Tis pride inflames him;&#8212;holy zeal he dubs it straight;<br> Not conscious of the vanity that makes his freight.<br> A zeal for holiness by other tokens shines;<br> And lights a fire by which to ashes earth declines.</p>

<p><a name="page_m243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></A></p>  
<p>Such deaf man once was made aware by some kind friend,<br> That next door dwelt an invalid near to his end.<br> The poor man thought within himself: "I'm deaf as stone,<br> How can I hope to comprehend this neighbour's tone? <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_135">135</A></FONT></span><br> More 'specially as sick men speak so very low.<br> Still, go I must; mere decency demands my bow.<br> When I advance, he'll me address, his lips will move.<br> From thence I'll glean a notion, may not quite false prove.<br> I'll ask him how he feels to-day, &#8217;mid so much pain.<br> He'll answer surely: 'Thank you; better in the main:<br> Reply I will: 'Most happy! How's the appetite?'<br> He'll answer: 'Pretty good, if chicken-broth invite.'<br> I'll say: 'Good! Good! And what are you allowed to drink?<br> Who is your doctor?' He'll respond, as one may think. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_140">140</A></FONT></span><br> Then I'll remark: 'With so much talent at command,<br> You can't do better. Soon I hope to see you stand.<br> I've had experience of his skill; I know his worth;<br> With him as guide, you'll not go wrong.' So forth."</p>  
<p>Thus having got his fancied answers all by heart,<br> He goes to see the sick man; deftly plays his part.<br> On asking: "How are you?" the patient says: "Near dead."<br> The deaf man straight rejoins: "Of that I'm very glad."<br> The sufferer felt insulted by this joy expressed.<br> The deaf one had surmised,&#8212;had failed in what he'd guessed. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_145">145</A></FONT></span><br> He now inquired the diet: "Oh! It's poison all!"<br> Complained the sick man. "Glad to hear it," he let fall.<br> Still more the patient wondered. "Who attends you, pray?"<br> Asked Deafy; "whose advice is&#8217;t leads you on your way?"<br> "Death tracks my hours!" said he; "pray leave me now to rest."<br> The other answered: "Better can't be found; he's best."</p>  
<p><a name="page_m244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></A></p>  
<p>The visitor retired, quite pleased with his rich art;<br> And offered thanks for having played so kind a part.<br> The sick man, on the contrary, was all on fire:<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_150">150</A></FONT></span> "Whence comes this malice? Who has roused his soul to ire?"<br> So, turning in his mind the matter o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er,<br> A message he determines that shall pay the score.<br> Just so, a man who's eaten ill-digesting food,<br> Can have no rest till it's ejected, well and good.<br> Long-suffering is thy better part, reject it not;<br> With patience, thou shalt find soft words best heal a plot.<br> But our sick man found no such solace for his mind;<br> He called the deaf one "Ass," and "Fool," and "Sot," and "Blind."<br> Said he: "I'll serve him out; I'll pay him what's his due!<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_155">155</A></FONT></span> Till then, my spirit will his hateful visit rue!<br> A visit to the sick's for consolation's sake;<br> His visit I abhor, his insults I'll not take.<br> He's wished to gloat on foe laid prostrate at his feet;<br> Some joy to gather thence his secret hate to greet."</p>  
<p>How many pious men there are, to outward view,<br> Reward of joy in heaven, as object, who pursue.<br> At heart they're sinners still, despite the show they make.<br> Alas! Hypocrisy for righteousness they take!<br> Just as our deaf man thought he'd done a friendly act;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_160">160</A></FONT></span> And yet, withal, had vexed his neighbour, as a fact.<br> He soothed his soul by thinking: "Kindly part I've played!<br> I've acted as a neighbour! Sorrow I've allayed!"<br> Whereas, in truth, a fire he'd lighted for himself;<br> And his sick neighbour's heart inspired with vengeful elf.</p>
