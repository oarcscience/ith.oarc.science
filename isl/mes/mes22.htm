<p>One bird of the flock, he saw, then took to quake,<br> Fell prone to the earth; no more breath seemed to take.<br> The merchant regret felt for what he had done,<br> Exclaiming: "Alas!

<p>Our merchant his trading had quickly despatched,<br> Then homeward he turned; with joy housedoor unlatched.</p>

<p>To ev&#8217;ry male slave a rare present he brought;<br> For each of his handmaids some gift he had bought. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_105">105</A></FONT></span><br> The parrot him questioned: "What news bringest thou me?<br> And whom hast thou seen?

<p>The parrot then asked: "What's this fuss all about?<br> What's caused tribulation? Let's hear it right out."<br> The merchant now said: "I told all thy sad grief<br> To flock of green parrots;&#8212;so like thee, their chief. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_110">110</A></FONT></span><br> Of them, one, affected with thy tale of woe,<br> Heart-broken, a gasp gave, expired, and fell low.<br> I conscience-struck was for the words I had said.<br> But what is the use?

<p>A spoken word's arrow swift shot from a bow,<br> It can't be recalled, whate&#8217;er we may do.<br> An arrow once shot off will never come back.<br> At source, inundation alone can have check.<br> An outlet once found, there's no stoppage for it.<br> A world is then ruined, through lack of quick wit. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_115">115</A></FONT></span><br> Act, consequence little dreamt of may produce.<br> The progeny's far &#8217;yond our power to reduce.</p>

<p>Remembrance, forgetfulness, both are of God.<br> Support and aid, too, must depend on His nod.<br> Of thoughts, God, men's good and bad souls voids, each night,<br> By millions.
