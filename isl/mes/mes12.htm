<p align="center"><i>Genealogy of Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, R&#363;m&#299;</i>.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">On</span> his father's side, the remote ancestor of Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, during Isl&#257;mic times, was Ab&#363;-Bekr, the dearest and most faithful friend of Muhammed the Arabian lawgiver, and his successor in the government of the community of Isl&#257;m, as the first of the long line of Caliphs.</p>  
<p>Like Muhammed himself, Ab&#363;-Bekr was of the tribe of Quraysh, which claims descent, through Ishmael, from Abraham, the chosen Friend of God, and Father of the faithful. The stem of Ab&#363;-Bekr's branch of the tribe unites with that of Muhammed in Murra, ancestor to Muhammed in the seventh degree, and to Ab&#363;-Bekr in the sixth.</p>  
<p>Ab&#363;-Bekr was, furthermore, one of Mohammed's fathers-in-law, as his daughter &#8216;&#256;&#8217;isha was the Prophet's only virgin bride.</p>  
<p>A son or grandson of Ab&#363;-Bekr is said to have been among the Arabian conquerors of Khur&#257;s&#257;n during the caliphate of &#8216;Uthm&#257;n (Osm&#257;n), about <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 25 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 647), and to have settled at Balkh (the capital of the ancient Bactria), where his family flourished until after the birth of Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A></p>  
<p>At an uncertain period subsequent to <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 491 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1097), a daughter of one of the Kh&#8217;&#257;rezmian kings of Central Asia was given in marriage to Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n's great-great-grandfather, whose name is either not mentioned by Efl&#257;k&#299;, or I have missed it. She gave birth to Jel&#257;l's great-grandfather, Ahmed, surnamed El-Khat&#299;b&#299; (as being, apparently, a son or descendant, or a client, of a public preacher, Khat&#299;b).</p>  
<p>Nothing more is mentioned of Ahmed by Efl&#257;k&#299;, than that he had a son Huseyn, surnamed Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, who married a daughter of a certain Khurrem-Sh&#257;h, King of Khur&#257;s&#257;n, and became grandfather, by her, to the author of the Mesnev&#299;. His son, Mohammed, surnamed Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, styled Sult&#257;nu-&#8217;l-&#8216;Ulem&#257;, and commonly known as Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Veled, or shorter as Bah&#257; Veled, appears also to have married a lady, by whom he had three children, a daughter and two sons.</p>  
<p>Bah&#257; Veled's eldest child, his daughter, was married off, and remained at Balkh, when Bah&#257; Veled, his mother, and two sons left it, a year or so before it was taken and devastated by Jeng&#299;z Kh&#257;n in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 608 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1211). His elder son is not again mentioned by Efl&#257;k&#299; after their departure from Balkh. Neither is the mother of his children once mentioned. But his own mother, the princess, was alive, and was still with him in about <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1230; after which, she too is not again mentioned.</p>  
<p>Bah&#257; Veled's youngest child, his most celebrated son Mohammed, surnamed Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, Mevl&#257;n&#257;, Khud&#257;vendg&#257;r, and R&#363;m&#299;, the principal personage of these memoirs, the founder of the order of the Mevlev&#299; dervishes, and author of the Mesnev&#299;, had four children, three boys and a girl, by two wives. His eldest son was killed</p>  
<p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></A></p>  
<p>in the broil that caused the murder of his father's friend Shemsu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n of Tebr&#299;z. His youngest son is not taken further notice of; but his daughter was married off to a local prince, and left Qonya.</p>  
<p>His second son, and eventually his successor as Principal or Abbot of his order, was named Muhammed, and surnamed Bah&#257;&#8217;u-'D&#299;n. He is commonly known as Sultan Veled.</p>  
<p>Sultan Veled had six children, a boy and two girls by his wife F&#257;tima, daughter of Sheykh Fer&#299;d&#363;n the Gold- beater, and three boys, of whom two were twins, by two slave women. The daughters married well, and all his sons, or three of them, succeeded him as Abbot, one after the other. The eldest was M&#299;r &#8216;&#256;rif (Cheleb&#299; Em&#299;r &#8216;&#256;rif), the second was named &#8216;&#256;bid, the third Z&#257;hid, and the fourth W&#257;hid.</p>  
<p>Cheleb&#299; Em&#299;r &#8216;Arif, the eldest, and Efl&#257;k&#299;'s patron, had two sons and a daughter. His eldest son, Em&#299;r &#8216;&#256;lim, surnamed Sh&#257;h-z&#257;da, succeeded eventually to the primacy after his uncles. With him, Efl&#257;k&#299;'s memoir is brought to a close.</p>  
<p>Such was the natural line of this dynasty of eminent men. But Efl&#257;k&#299; has also given the links of a spiritual series, through whom the mysteries of the dervish doctrines were handed down to and in the line of Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n.</p>  
<p>In the anecdote No. 79, of chapter iii., the account is given of the manner in which the prophet Muhammed confided those mysteries to his cousin, son-in-law, and afterwards his fourth successor, as Caliph, &#8216;Al&#299; son of Ab&#363;-T&#257;lib, the "Victorious Lion of God."</p>  
<p>&#8216;Al&#299; communicated the mysteries to the Im&#257;m Hasan of Basra, who died in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 110 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 728); Hasan taught them to Hab&#299;b the Persian,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who confided them to D&#257;w&#363;d</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A></p>  
<p>of the tribe of Tayyi&#8217;,&#8212;Et-T&#257;&#8217;&#299; (mentioned by D&#8217;Herbelot, without a date, as Davud Al Thai; he died <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 165, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 781).</p>  
<p>D&#257;w&#363;d transmitted them to Ma&#8216;r&#363;f of Kerkh (who died <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 200, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 815); he to Sirr&#299; the merchant of damaged goods (Es-Saqat&#299;?; died <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 253, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 867); and he to the great Juneyd (who died in about <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 297&#8212;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 909). Juneyd's spiritual pupil was Shibl&#299; (died <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 334, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 945) who taught Abu-&#8216;Amr Muhammed, son of Ibr&#257;h&#299;m Zajj&#257;j (the Glazier), of N&#299;sh&#257;p&#363;r (who died in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 348&#8212;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 959) and his pupil was Ab&#363;-Bekr, son of &#8216;Abdu-&#8217;ll&#257;h, of T&#363;s, the Weaver, who taught Ab&#363;-Ahmed (Muhammed son of Muhammed, El-Gaz&#257;l&#299; (who died <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 504&#8212;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1110), and he committed those mysteries to Ahmed el-Khat&#299;b&#299;, Jel&#257;l's great-grandfather, who consigned them to the Im&#257;m Sarakhs&#299; (who died in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 571&#8212;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1175).</p>  
<p>Sarakhs&#299; was the spiritual teacher of Jel&#257;l's father Bah&#257; Veled, who taught the Seyyid Burh&#257;nu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Term&#299;zi, the instructor of Jel&#257;l. He again passed on the tradition to Shemsu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n of Tebr&#299;z, the teacher of Jel&#257;l's son, Sultan Veled, who himself taught the Em&#299;r &#8216;&#256;rif.</p>  
<p>At the same time that the mysteries were thus being gradually transmitted to Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n and his successors by these links, they were also being diffused in thousands of other channels, and are at this day widely diffused over the world of Isl&#257;m, which daily boasts of its living saints and their miracles. These latter are perhaps not less veracious that those continually blazoned forth by the Church of Rome, and by its Eastern sisters. We, too, have our spiritualists. Credulity will never forsake mankind and prodigies will never be lacking for the credulous to place faith in. There is much that is human in man, all the world over.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_34"></A><A HREF="mes12.htm#fr_35">132:1</A> A genealogy is given in the Turkish preface to my copy of the Mesnev&#299;, which traces the descent of Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n Mohammed from Ab&#363;-Bekr in ten degrees, as follows:&#8212;"Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, son of Bah&#257;&#8217;u-&#8217;d-D&#299;n, son of Huseyn, son of Ahmed, son of Mevd&#363;d, son of S&#257;bit (Th&#257;bit), son of Museyyeb, son of Mutahhar, son of Hamm&#257;d, son of &#8216;Abdu-&#8217;r-Rahm&#257;n, son of &#8216;Ab&#363;-Bekr." Now, Abdu-&#8217;r-Rahm&#257;n, the eldest of all the sons of Ab&#363;-Bekr, died and was buried at Mekka in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 53(<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 672), and <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A> Jel&#257;lu-&#8217;d-D&#299;n was born at Balkh in <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.h.</span> 604 (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span> 1207). Between these two there are nine degrees of descent given, for a period of 535 years, or 66 years for each life after the birth of the next link. This alone suffices to show that the genealogy is not to be depended on. Supposing the names given to be true, many other links must be missing; as many, probably, as those given.</P>
