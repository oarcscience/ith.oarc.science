### TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

THE historian El Eflākī was a disciple of Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif, a grandson
of the author of the Mesnevī. ‘Ārif died in <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1320; but as the dates of ‘Ārif's
successors are carried down to <span class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 754
(<span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1353), when Eflākī's collection of
anecdotes was completed, the historian must have outlived this last
date. As a disciple of the Emīr ‘Ārif, he was a dervish of the order
named Mevlevī, as being followers of the rule and practices of Mevlānā
Jelālu-’d-Dīn, er-Rūmī, commonly known in English literature as "the
dancing dervishes," expressed by Americans: "whirling dervishes." The
dervishes of the order do not all dance or "whirl." Some are musicians,
and some singers or chanters, who may, however, be occasional dancers
also.

Eflākī's work gives a sufficiency of dates to fix the principal events
that he commemorates. His dates do not agree exactly with those found in
other historians. They are, however, sufficiently near for general
purposes not of a chronologically critical nature. They commence with
<span class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 605 <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> (1208), and thus cover a period of 145
years dated, besides another 30 years of the lifetime of

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jelāl's
grandfather undated, who was a noble of such high standing and of so
great a reputation for learning and sanctity at Balkh, that the king
gave him his only daughter in marriage, unsolicited. His mother was also
a princess of the same royal house with his wife.

This royal house was the one known in history as that of *Kh’ārezm-shāh*
or the Kharezmians. They were overthrown, and Balkh (the ancient Bactra,
or Zariaspa), their capital, destroyed, by Jengīz Khan in <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1211. A remnant of their kingdom was
continued for twelve years longer by the last of the line, who died, at
once a fugitive and an invader, in Āzerbāyjān, in a battle fought
against the combined forces of Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor.

Jelāl's family claimed descent from Abū-Bekr, a father-in-law and the
first successor of Muhammed, the lawgiver of Islām. One of the
descendants of Abū-Bekr was among the conquerors of the ancient Bactria,
when it was first brought under Muslim rule, in about <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 650, under the Caliph ‘Uthmān and his
children had maintained a prominent position in that country, possessed
of great wealth, until the time immediately preceding the irruption of
Jengīz.

Jelāl was the youngest of three children, two being sons, born of the
princess, his mother, in Balkh. The eldest, a daughter, was already
married, and remained behind with her husband, when her father and
brothers left their native city some time between <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1208 and 121 I, in which latter year they
were at Bagdad. There is no further mention of Jelāl's elder brother.
Jelāl was five years old when they left Balkh. By way of Bagdād they
went to Mekka, thence to Damascus, and next to

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Erzinjān, in
Armenia; thence to Larenda, in Asia Minor. Jelāl's mother was still with
the party. He was now eighteen years old; and was married, at Larenda,
to a lady named Gevher (Pearl), daughter of a certain Lala
Sherefu-’d-Dīn of Samarqand, in <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>
1226. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) She bore him two sons there,
‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn (afterwards killed in a tumult at Qonya) and Bahā’u-’d-Dīn
Sultān Veled, through whom the succession of the house was continued.
She appears to have died rather young; for Jelāl afterwards married
another lady of Qonya, who outlived him, and by whom he had two other
children, a son and a daughter. (See Anecdotes, Chap. iii., No. 69, for
a variant.)

After the birth of Sultān Veled at Larenda, Jelāl's father was invited
to Qonya by the Seljūqi king, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn Kayqubād, where he founded a
college, and where he died in <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1231.
The king built a marble mausoleum over his grave, with this date
inscribed on it. The king himself died, five years later, in <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1236.

At his father's death, Jelāl went to Aleppo and Damascus for several
years to study, and then returned to Qonya, where he was appointed
professor of four separate colleges. His reputation for learning and
sanctity became very great.

But before this journey to Damascus, he appears to have paid a visit to
Larenda. For, a former pupil of his father's at Balkh, who had become a
great saint and anchoret, came to Qonya to seek Jelāl, and was the cause
of his returning from Larenda to the capital.

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

This was the Sheykh and Seyyid Burhānu-’d-Dīn, who became Jelāl's
spiritual teacher for some time. The dates given do not agree in the
various branches of Eflākī's compilation; for he here gives a period of
nine years'’ spiritual study at Qonya under Burhān.

After Burhān's instructions and departure from Qonya to Qaysariyya,
where he died, and after Jelāl's studies at Aleppo and Damascus, with
his subsequent return to Qonya and appointment to the four colleges,
another great saint came to visit Jelāl at this latter city. This was
Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz, for whom Jelāl conceived a very great
friendship. He is mentioned in the Mesnevī several times in very high
terms. He appears to have been exceedingly aggressive and domineering in
his manner. This roused a fierce animosity against him, which at length
broke out in a tumult. Jelāl's eldest son, ‘Alā’u-’d-Dīn, was killed or
mortally hurt in this disturbance. The local police seized Shemsu-’d-Dīn
in consequence, and he was never again seen alive by his friends. Jelāl
went himself to Damascus, in hopes that he might have been sent away, or
have got away, privately. But the effort was fruitless. Later traditions
cause his corpse to have been recovered and buried at Qonya, differing,
however, as to the place of interment.

When Jelāl found that he required assistance in conducting all the
various duties that fell on him, he selected first for that office his
former fellow-student, Sheykh Salāhu-’d-Dīn Ferīdūn, surnamed Zer-Kūb
(the Gold-beater), from his business. He assisted Jelāl for about ten
years, and died in <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1258.

Jelāl now took as his assistant his own favourite pupil,

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hasan
Husāmu-’d-Dīn, surnamed the son of Akhī-Turk, through his being
descended from some man of celebrity of the name or designation of
Akhī-Turk. There appears to have been a large family of very influential
men residing at Qonya and other towns of Asia Minor, all calling
themselves Akhī, and distinguished as Akhī: Ahmed, Akhī: Eshref, &c. The
word "Akhī" is Arabic, and signifies "my brother." It may also mean "one
related to a brother," as a servant, slave, client, &c., of some prince,
&c.; or of some dervish "brother" of some religious order. Indeed, these
very numerous individuals named Akhī, may have been each a "brother" of
such a fraternity or fraternities, or even of some industrial guild.

Ten years after Husām was taken as his assistant by Jelāl, this latter
was called to his rest in December <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>
1273; and was buried in his father's mausoleum, leaving Husām as his
successor. But meanwhile, at Husām's suggestion, and with himself as the
first amanuensis thereof, the Mesnevī had been composed, in six volumes,
books, or parts, by Jelāl. The second volume was commenced in <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1263. There had been an interval of two
years between the completion of the first and this, caused by Husām's
grief at the death of his wife. The whole work is stated to contain
twenty-six thousand six hundred and sixty couplets. A seventh volume or
book has been also attributed to the Mesnevī, to make up the number to
that of the "seven planets;" some say it was composed or collected by
Sultan Veled. The anecdotes of Eflākī make mention of many hundreds of
odes composed also by Jelāl.

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

He is said to have instituted his peculiar order of dervishes, with
their special dress, the Indian garb of mourning, in memory of his
murdered friend, Shemsu-’d-Dīn of Tebrīz; and to have adopted the use of
instrumental music, the flute, the rebeck, the drum, and the tambourine,
with singing or chanting, as an accompaniment to the holy dance, on
account of the lethargic nature of the "Romans." As a child is tempted
to take a salutary medicine by the exhibition of a little jam or honey,
so Jelāl judged that the "Romans" might be tempted to a devotional love
for God through the bait of sweet sounds addressed to their outward
senses. Dancing or twirling by dervishes was of much older date, as will
be recollected in one of the tales of the Arabian Nights.

Husām died in <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1284, just ten years
after his teacher Jelāl; whose son, Bahā’u-’d-Dīn, Sultan Veled,
succeeded Husām as chief of the order, and died in <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1312. His son, Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif,
succeeded him, and passed away in <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>
1320; two of his half-brothers becoming chiefs of the order after him in
succession.

Eflākī informs us that he undertook the compilation of his work at the
express desire of his spiritual teacher, Chelebī Emīr ‘Ārif. The preface
gives the year <span class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 710 (<span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1310) as that of its commencement, and the
colophon at the end mentions <span class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 754
(<span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1353) as the date of its
completion. He thus spent forty-three years in his labour of love. The
copy used for the present translation was written in <span
class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 1027 (<span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>
1617), and belongs to the library of the India Office, being No. 1670.
It is a quarto volume of 291 numbered folios of two pages each folio,
and twenty-three lines in each page. It is subdivided

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

into a preface, of two folios, and ten chapters of very different
lengths, thus:

The work contains many hundreds of anecdotes, related to Eflākī by
trustworthy reporters, whose names are generally given, and a few for
which he vouches himself as an eyewitness. Every anecdote is the account
of a miracle wrought by the living or the dead; or is the narrative of
some strange or striking event. It is, in fact, a species of the Acts of
the Apostles of the Mevlevi dervish fathers, and is a rare specimen of
what fervid religious enthusiasm can invent or exaggerate, pious
credulity can believe, and confiding ignorance accept. In these days of
Christian "Spiritualism," let not the reader be over-shocked at learning
that Muslim "Saints," lovers of their Creator, and beloved by Him in
return, hold themselves and are held by their dervish brethren to be the
successors and spiritual inheritors of the prophets, from Adam to
Muhammed; that, in virtue of this spiritual communion with God, they
know all the secrets and mysteries of heaven and earth, and not only
suspend or overrule the laws of nature at their will, but also deal out
death or disease by their

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

anger, health or prosperity by their blessing; the whole in strict
accordance, however, with the eternal will and foreknowledge of Him by
whom alone all things are made.

The anecdotes translated are chosen as being characteristic of various
points of dervish credence or assertion. Most of them inculcate some
moral truth or point of practical wisdom. A few will be found, however,
to go far beyond the credible; and one or two, unless totally
misunderstood by the translator, are simply and grossly blasphemous.
These last are here given as specimens of the exaggerated dervish
doctrines which cause the orthodox among the ‘Ulemā <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) of Islām to hold all such quasi-religious
associations to be more or less heterodox.

The dervishes of Islām appear to be a kind of Gnostics. They style
themselves Poor, Impassioned, Adepts, and Perfect. In many respects
their doctrines correspond with those of Buddha, Pythagoras, and Plato,
making all souls that are destined to salvation to be emanations from
the divine Light or Glory of God, in which they will be again
congregated; and all those doomed to perdition to have been formed out
of the Fire of His wrath, to which also they will eventually be
consigned.

It is but too patent to the translator that he is bound to sue for the
kind indulgence of a critical public, in offering them the present
volume in verse. He has no claim to being a poet himself; and had never
practised the art

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

of metrical composition until very lately. Sensible himself to the
earnestness of thought and beauty of diction imbedded in the writings of
the great poets of Ishim, and keenly aware of the condition of dry bones
to which literal prose translation almost always reduces a songster's
numbers, he has preferred to clothe his author in a presentable garb,
though it be but a crumpled wrap, rather than exhibit him to readers of
taste as a mangled mass, stripped of all beauty, and in great measure
divested even of cognisable form, through the conflict of dictions and
diversities of ideas.

He is in the position of the raindrop sung by Sa‘dī (see Chap. iii., No.
14., of the Anecdotes), and mentioned of old by Chardin, Addison, and
Sir William Jones. May the thoughts in the Mesnevī be the gems that will
make his effort acceptable to the British public. At most, he is but the
diver who risks extinction in the hope that he may have a chance to
offer an acceptable pearl of price to those for whom he has worked

"A raindrop, from a cloud distilled,  
 At sea's expanse with tremor filled,  
 Mused: 'Where the main rolls, am I aught?  
 In ocean's presence, sure, I'm naught.'  
 Itself, thus eyed with scorn profound,  
 In oyster's bosom nurture found.  
 Time's wheel wrought changes manifold;  
 Rich pearl of price the raindrop's told.  
 Meek modesty its prize received;  
 By naught's gate ent’ring, worth achieved."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[vii:1](mes02.htm#fr_0.md) For the incidents and
dates mentioned in this preface, see the various chapters of the
Anecdotes.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[ix:1](mes02.htm#fr_1.md) He must have been born in
about <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 1204 or 2205, to have been
five years old when the family left Balkh. In 1226 he would, therefore,
be twenty-one or twenty-two years of  age. But see Anecdotes, Chap. i.,
No. 2, &c.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[xiv:1](mes02.htm#fr_2.md) The "*‘Ulemā of Islām*"
are *the Learned* Doctors of Law and Divinity; their chief is the Lord
Chancellor. They are ignorantly spoken of as "*priests*" and "*clergy*"
by Europeans. There are no "*priests*" in Islām. The ‘Ulemā may be
likened to the Jewish Rabbis. They often have followed, and do follow,
all kinds of trades.
