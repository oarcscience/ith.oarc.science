### PREFACE.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> is the book of the Rhymed Couplets
(Mathnawī, Mesnevī). It contains the roots of the roots of the roots of
the (one true) Religion (of Islām); and treats of the discovery of the
mysteries of reunion and sure knowledge. It is the Grand Jurisprudence
of God, the most glorious Law of the Deity, the most manifest Evidence
of the Divine Being. The refulgence thereof "is like that of a lantern
in which is a lamp" <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) that scatters
beams more bright than the morn. It is the paradise of the heart, with
springs and foliage. One of those springs is "the fount named
Salsabīl" <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_37.md) by the brethren of this
religious order (of mystical devotees known as the *Mevlevī* or *Dancing
Dervishes*); but, by saints and the miraculously endowed, it is called
"the Good Station" <span id="fr_39"></span>[3](#fn_38.md) and "the Best
Resting-place." <span id="fr_40"></span>[4](#fn_39.md) The just shall eat
and drink therein, and the righteous shall rejoice and be glad thereof.
Like the Egyptian Nile, it is a beverage for the patient, but a delusion
to the people of Pharaoh and to blasphemers; even as God, whose name be
glorified, hath said: "He misleads therewith many, and He guides
therewith many; but He misleads not therewith (any), save the
wicked." <span id="fr_41"></span>[5](#fn_40.md)

<span id="page_mii">p. ii</span>

It is a comfort to men's breasts, an expeller of cares. It is an
exposition of the Qur’ān, an amplification of spiritual aliments, and a
dulcifier of the disposition; written "by the hands of honorable
scribes," <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) who inscribe thereon the
prohibition: "Let none touch it save the purified." <span
id="fr_43"></span>[2](#fn_42) It is (a revelation.md) "sent down (from on
high) by the Lord of (all) the worlds," <span
id="fr_44"></span>[3](#fn_43.md) which vanity approacheth not from before,
nor from behind," <span id="fr_45"></span>[4](#fn_44.md) which God watches
over and observes, He being " the best as a Preserver," <span
id="fr_46"></span>[5](#fn_45.md) and "the Most Compassionate of the
merciful ones," <span id="fr_47"></span>[6](#fn_46.md) unto whom pertain
(many) titles, His utmost title being God, whose name be exalted.

We have been brief in (stating) this little; for a little is an index to
much, and a mouthful may point out a pond, as a handful may serve as a
sample for a whole threshing-floor, however large.

Thus saith the feeble servant, in need of the mercy of God, whose name
be extolled, Muhammed son of Muhammed son of Huseyn, of (the city of)
Balkh, <span id="fr_48"></span>[7](#fn_47.md) of whom may God accept it: "I
have exerted myself to enlarge this book of poetry in rhyming couplets,
which contains strange and rare narratives, beautiful sayings, and
recondite indications, a path for the devout, and a garden for the
pious, short in its expressions, numerous in their applications. This
have I done at the instance of my lord and master, my trust, and as the
soul in my body, the moral store of my to-day and my morrow, the Sheykh
Hasan son of Muhammed son of Hasan, commonly known by the appellation of
Akhī-Turk (my brother Turk), a

<span id="page_miii">p. iii</span>

chief of the knowing ones (Gnostics?), a leader of right direction and
sure knowledge, a helper of the human race, a confidant of men's hearts
and minds, a charge of God among His creatures, His pure one among His
reasoning servants, (a compendium of) His commandments to His Prophet,
of His mysteries with His chosen one, a key to the treasures of the
throne, a custodian of the riches of the extended earth, a man of
excellencies, a sharp sword for the severance of truth and religion
(from falsehood and blasphemy), <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) the
Bāyezīd <span id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_49.md) of the age, the Juneyd <span
id="fr_51"></span>[3](#fn_50.md) of the period, the true friend son of a
true friend son of a true friend, may God be pleased with him and with
them, originally from the town of Urmiyya, <span
id="fr_52"></span>[4](#fn_51.md) and related to the venerated Sheykh, <span
id="fr_53"></span>[5](#fn_52.md) as he himself expressed it: 'I was a Kurd
one evening, and was an Arabian in the morning.' <span
id="fr_54"></span>[6](#fn_53.md) May God sanctify his spirit, and the
spirits of his successors! Blessed is such a predecessor; blessed are
such successors! He was descended from a line on which the sun had cast
its

<span id="page_miv">p. iv</span>

lustrous mantle, and personal nobility such that the stars shed their
lights around it. May their courtyard ever be a centre to which the sons
of saints will turn, and a temple of hopes about which embassies of
spotless men will circulate. May it not cease to be thus while a
constellation rises and a sparkling orb appears above the horizon in the
east; so that it may be a thing held to by those who are possessed of
insight, the godly, the spiritual, the heavenly, the celestial, the men
of light, who keep silence and observe, who are absent though present,
who are kings clothed in rags, the nobles of nations, endowed with
virtues, the lights of guidances. Amen, O Lord of (all) the worlds. And
this is a prayer not to be rejected; for it is a prayer joined in by all
the good. And glory be to God in His unity. And may God pronounce
blessings on our lord, Muhammed, and on his family and kin, the good,
the clean!

<span id="fn_49"></span>[miii:2](mes14.htm#fr_50.md) Bāyezīd or Abū-Yazīd,
of Bestām, in Khurāsān, Persia, latitude 36°, 25´ N., longitude 55°, 0´
E., a celebrated teacher and saint among the mystics of Islām, died
<span class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 265, <span
class="smallcaps">a.d.</span> 874 (though <span
class="smallcaps">a.h.</span> 234, <span class="smallcaps">a.d.</span>
848, has also been mentioned by some). His name was Tayfūr, son of ‘Isà,
son of Ādam, son of Surūshān, a Zoroastrian who embraced Islām.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[miii:3](mes14.htm#fr_51.md) Juneyd, surname of
Abū-’l-Qāsim Sa‘īd son of ‘Ubayd, entitled Sultan of the Sūfī Community,

<span id="fn_51"></span>[miii:4](mes14.htm#fr_52.md) Urmiyya, on the lake
of that name, south-west from Tebrīz, the capital city of Azerbāyjān,
the northwest province of Persia.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[miii:5](mes14.htm#fr_53.md) The expression of:
"*The venerated Sheykh*," might, perhaps, at first, be thought to
indicate the Caliph Abū-Bekr, the Sheykh par excellence, as he and his
successor ‘Umer (Omar) were designated "*the two Sheykhs*," from each
being a father-in-law to Muhammed, whereas the third and fourth caliphs,
‘Uthmān (Osmān) and ‘Alī, were his sons-in-law. If this supposition were
correct, Jelāl and Husām would have been descended from the same remote
ancestor. The commentators, however. I am informed, name a certain
"Seyyid Abū-’l-Wefā, the Kurd," as being intended. Particulars as to his
individuality and history have not, unfortunately, reached me.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[miii:6](mes14.htm#fr_54.md) I have not met with an
explanation of this expression, which is again introduced in Tale xiv.,
distich 40.
