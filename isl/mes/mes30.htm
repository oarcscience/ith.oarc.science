<p>THE Prophet asked one morn of Zeyd, in tender tone,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> "How art thou, dear disciple, faithful to the bone?"<br> "I'm pious;&#8212;a believer," Zeyd replied; and he<br> Inquired again: "What proof of faith resides in thee?"<br> He said: "Whole days I've burnt with parching fever's thirst;<br> By night I've watched; with love's sweet pangs my heart's nigh burst.<br> Thus have I traversed days&#8217; and nights&#8217; enduring space,<br> As point of spear through shield makes way in war's embrace.<br> For, in love's view, the church of faith one body is;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_5">5</A></FONT></span> Ten million years, one instant, are alike, when His.<br> The past eternity and future join in one;<br> Though reason cannot compass how the marvel's done."</p>  
<p>The Prophet then: "Bring forth some souvenir from thence,<br> Shall satisfy all men of judgment and of sense."<br> Said Zeyd: "As men behold the sky above their heads,<br> So I survey the heavens, and all their flowery meads.<br> Eight paradises,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_377"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> seven deep hells,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are in my view,<br> As patent as the idol to its silly crew.</p>

<p>&#8217;Tis thus that saints, within the bounds of present life,<br> See who'll be blessed, who cursed, when tried in judgment's strife;<br> Before each soul contracts the sins will cause its shame;<br> While yet in mother's womb,&#8212;while yet without a name.<br> The wretch is he conceived for wretchedness&#8217; sad thirst.<br> Each soul is marked for future bliss or woe, at first.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> The body, as a mother, bears within a soul.<br> Death's but the throes that launch the spirit to its goal. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_15">15</A></FONT></span><br> Departed souls are all agog at each fresh birth,<br> To see what class the new-born enters in its mirth.<br> The blacks presume &#8217;twill prove to be of their dark gang;<br> The pale-faced Romans hope they'll profit by the pang.<br> But when the little stranger shows itself at last,<br> No room remains for doubt; the question's judged and cast.<br> The new-born black is borne in triumph by its kind;<br> The rosy-cheeked fair bantling's claimed by Roman mind.<br> Until its birth the child's a riddle to all men.<br> Who knows an unborn infant &#8217;s rare sage in this glen. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_20">20</A></FONT></span><br> Unless, mayhap, he see with light divine's blest aid;<br> For this can penetrate through densest shell e&#8217;er made.<br> The life-conveying fluid's colourless and clear;<br> But living men their various shades of colour bear.<br> The soul sustains complexions in our mortal frames,<br> Until our halves material find rest from their games.<br> But turn we now away to other subjects, high;<br> For fear events should leave us to regret and sigh.</p>

<p>The lord one day commanded; straight some slaves were sent<br> To gather fruit from orchard for his throat's content.<br> With them did Luqm&#257;n go, as parasite to feast,<br> Brimful of wisdom, black as night, a negro beast.<br> Their labour o&#8217;er, the slaves lay down to rest awhile;<br> The fruit they tasted, tasted still, consumed the pile.<br> Returning home, on Luqm&#257;n the whole blame they laid;<br> His lord was angered mightily at what they said.<br> Luqm&#257;n inquired the cause of this estrangement keen.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_90">90</A></FONT></span> The lord gave vent in loud abuse to his roused spleen.<br> Said Luqm&#257;n: "Lord, I swear by God's most holy name,<br> Dishonest servant ne&#8217;er can hope for aught but blame.<br> Make proof of us. &#8217;Tis easy.

<p>Their lord so ordered. Scalding water soon was sought.<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_95">95</A></FONT></span> Each had to drink his fill, as hot as could be brought.<br> Then all were made to run as fast as they could tear,<br> All up and down the meadow, as their legs could bear.<br> Now lo! What happens? Sickness on them, each, soon falls;<br> To vomit they're constrained, with starting of eyeballs.<br> The stolen fruit contained within their stomach's sack,<br> The water's stimulus compelled them to give back.</p>

<p>When Luqm&#257;n's turn was come to cast up his accounts,<br> Clear water was the only issue from his founts.<br> Luqm&#257;n's philosophy this trial could evolve;<br> God's wisdom far abstruser riddles will resolve. <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_100">100</A></FONT></span><br> "The day when our hearts&#8217; secrets shall be all revealed,"<br> Man's secret foe in ambush shall not lie concealed.<br> Hell's victims, then, shall taste of scalding water's pang;<br> And all veils be torn off from sins they overhang.<br> Hell-fire's decreed to be the lot of misbelief;<br> Since fire the ordeal is by which stones come to grief.</p>  
<p>How often have we spoken to those hearts of stone,<br> In softest accents of advice!

<p>Loose not thy tongue alone; it bridle; hidden's best.<br> Let each be happy in his own opinion's zest.<br> God wills that they who might despair to win His grace,<br> Shall persevere, not slacken, in their worship's pace</p>

<p>That hope and fear are nourished by a curtain's shade.<br> &#8217;Tis through uncertainty that hope and fear invade.<br> But tear away that veil; where then are hope and fear?<br> &#8217;Tis veiledness lends interest to landscapes drear.<br> Upon a river's bank a youth, who chanced to spy<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_120">120</A></FONT></span> A fisherman at work, guessed: "Solomon, surely!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><br> If he it be, why here, in secret and alone?<br> If not, whence come those features, fit to grace a throne?"<br> So he remained in doubt, &#8217;twixt two opinions tossed,<br> Till Solomon recovered all the power he'd lost.</p>  
<p>The foul usurping demon fled the royal state;<br> The king's avenging sword pursued and sealed his fate.<br> The signet-ring of power once more on royal hand,<br> The demons and the fairies flocked to his command.<br> Mankind came crowding to his court, by levee swelled;<br> <span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_125">125</A></FONT></span> Among them came the youth who'd that opinion held.<br> He saw the signet-ring.

<p>Opinion may be formed of what's behind a veil.<br> Conjecture lends its aid where knowledge &#8216;gins to fail.<br> Conjecture's potent when the subject's hid from view.<br> Let it be visible; no surmise can we brew.<br> Although the sky of light is not without its rain,<br> The earth of darkness, too, produces plants and grain.</p>
