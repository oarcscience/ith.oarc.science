## THE MYSTICS OF ISLAM

### INTRODUCTION

THE title of this book sufficiently explains why it is included in a
Series 'exemplifying the adventures and labours of individual seekers or
groups of seekers in quest of reality.' Sufism, the religious philosophy
of Islam, is described in the oldest extant definition as 'the
apprehension of divine realities,' and Mohammedan mystics are fond of
calling themselves *Ahl al-Haqq*, 'the followers of the Real.' <span
class="small">{*Al-Haqq* is the term generally used by Sufis when they
refer to God.}</span> In attempting to set forth their central doctrines
from this point of view, I shall draw to some extent on materials which
I have collected during the last twenty years for a general history of
Islamic mysticism--a subject so vast and many-sided that several large
volumes would be required to do it anything like justice. Here I can
only sketch

<span id="2"><span class="small">{p. 2}</span></span>

in broad outline certain principles, methods, and characteristic
features of the inner life as it has been lived by Moslems of every
class and condition from the eighth century of our era to the present
day. Difficult are the paths which they threaded, dark and bewildering
the pathless heights beyond; but even if we may not hope to accompany
the travellers to their journey's end, any information that we have
gathered concerning their religious environment and spiritual history
will help us to understand the strange experiences of which they write.

In the first place, therefore, I propose to offer a few remarks on the
origin and historical development of Sufism, its relation to Islam, and
its general character. Not only are these matters interesting to the
student of comparative religion; some knowledge of them is indispensable
to any serious student of Sufism itself. It may be said, truly enough,
that all mystical experiences ultimately meet in a single point; but
that point assumes widely different aspects according to the mystic's
religion, race, and temperament, while the converging lines of approach
admit of almost infinite variety. Though all the great types of
mysticism have something in common, each is marked by peculiar
characteristics resulting from the circum-

<span id="3"><span class="small">{p. 3}</span></span>

stances in which it arose and flourished. Just as the Christian type
cannot be understood without reference to Christianity, so the
Mohammedan type must be viewed in connexion with the outward and inward
development of Islam.

The word 'mystic,' which has passed from Greek religion into European
literature, is represented in Arabic, Persian, and Turkish, the three
chief languages of Islam, by 'Sufi.' The terms, however, are not
precisely synonymous, for 'Sufi' has a specific religious connotation,
and is restricted by usage to those mystics who profess the Mohammedan
faith. And the Arabic word, although in course of time it appropriated
the high significance of the Greek--lips sealed by holy mysteries, eyes
closed in visionary rapture--bore a humbler meaning when it first gained
currency (about 800 A.D.). Until recently its derivation was in dispute.
Most Sufis, flying in the face of etymology, have derived it from an
Arabic root which conveys the notion of 'purity'; this would make 'Sufi'
mean 'one who is pure in heart' or 'one of the elect.' Some European
scholars identified it with *«sophós»* in the sense of 'theosophist.'
But Nöldeke, in an article written twenty years ago, showed conclusively
that the name was derived from *suf* (wool), and was originally applied
to those Moslem

<span id="4"><span class="small">{p. 4}</span></span>

ascetics who, in imitation of Christian hermits, clad themselves in
coarse woollen garb as a sign of penitence and renunciation of worldly
vanities.

The earliest Sufis were, in fact, ascetics and quietists rather than
mystics. An overwhelming consciousness of sin, combined with a
dread--which it is hard for us to realise--of Judgment Day and the
torments of Hell-fire, so vividly painted in the Koran, drove them to
seek salvation in flight from the world. On the other hand, the Koran
warned them that salvation depended entirely on the inscrutable will of
Allah, who guides aright the good and leads astray the wicked. Their
fate was inscribed on the eternal tables of His providence, nothing
could alter it. Only this was sure, that if they were destined to be
saved by fasting and praying and pious works--then they would be saved.
Such a belief ends naturally in quietism, complete and unquestioning
submission to the divine will, an attitude characteristic of Sufism in
its oldest form. The mainspring of Moslem religious life during the
eighth century was fear--fear of God, fear of Hell, fear of death, fear
of sin--but the opposite motive had already begun to make its influence
felt, and produced in the saintly woman Rabi‘a at least one conspicuous
example of truly mystical self-abandonment.

<span id="5"><span class="small">{p. 5}</span></span>

\* \* \*

So far, there was no great difference between the Sufi and the orthodox
Mohammedan zealot, except that the Sufis attached extraordinary
importance to certain Koranic doctrines, and developed them at the
expense of others which many Moslems might consider equally essential.
It must also be allowed that the ascetic movement was inspired by
Christian ideals, and contrasted sharply with the active and
pleasure-loving spirit of Islam. In a famous sentence the Prophet
denounced monkish austerities and bade his people devote themselves to
the holy war against unbelievers; and he gave, as is well known, the
most convincing testimony in favour of marriage. Although his
condemnation of celibacy did not remain without effect, the conquest of
Persia, Syria, and Egypt by his successors brought the Moslems into
contact with ideas which profoundly modified their outlook on life and
religion. European readers of the Koran cannot fail to be struck by its
author's vacillation and inconsistency in dealing with the greatest
problems. He himself was not aware of these contradictions, nor were
they a stumbling-block to his devout followers, whose simple faith
accepted the Koran as the Word of God. But the rift was there, and soon
produced far-reaching results.

Hence arose the Murjites, who set faith

<span id="6"><span class="small">{p. 6}</span></span>

above works and emphasised the divine love and goodness; the Qadarites
who affirmed, and the Jabarites who denied, that men are responsible for
their actions; the Mu‘tazilites, who built a theology on the basis of
reason, rejecting the qualities of Allah as incompatible with His unity,
and predestinarianism as contrary to His justice; and finally the
Ash‘arites, the scholastic theologians of Islam, who formulated the
rigid metaphysical and doctrinal system that underlies the creed of
orthodox Mohammedans at the present time. All these speculations,
influenced as they were by Greek theology and philosophy, reacted
powerfully upon Sufism. Early in the third century of the Hegira--the
ninth after Christ--we find manifest signs of the new leaven stirring
within it. Not that Sufis ceased to mortify the flesh and take pride in
their poverty, but they now began to regard asceticism as only the first
stage of a long journey, the preliminary training for a larger spiritual
life than the mere ascetic is able to conceive. The nature of the change
may be illustrated by quoting a few sentences which have come down to us
from the mystics of this period.

> "Love is not to be learned from men: it is one of God's gifts and
> comes of His grace."

> "None refrains from the lusts of this world save him in whose heart
> there is a

<span id="7"><span class="small">{p. 7}</span></span>

> light that keeps him always busied with the next world."

> "When the gnostic's spiritual eye is opened, his bodily eye is shut:
> he sees nothing but God."

> "If gnosis were to take visible shape all who looked thereon would die
> at the sight of its beauty and loveliness and goodness and grace, and
> every brightness would become dark beside the splendour thereof."
> <span class="small">{Compare Plato, Phædrus (Jowett's translation):
> "For sight is the keenest of our bodily senses; though not by that is
> wisdom seen; her loveliness would have been transporting if there had
> been a visible image of her."}</span>

> "Gnosis is nearer to silence than to speech."

> "When the heart weeps because it has lost, the spirit laughs because
> it has found."

> "Nothing sees God and dies, even as nothing sees God and lives,
> because His life is everlasting: whoever sees it is thereby made
> everlasting."

> "O God, I never listen to the cry of animals or to the quivering of
> trees or to the murmuring of water or to the warbling of birds or to
> the rustling wind or to the crashing thunder without feeling them to
> be an evidence of Thy unity and a proof that there is nothing like
> unto Thee."

<span id="8"><span class="small">{p. 8}</span></span>

\* \* \*

> "O my God, I invoke Thee in public as lords are invoked, but in
> private as loved ones are invoked. Publicly I say, 'O my God!' but
> privately I say, 'O my Beloved!'"

These ideas--Light, Knowledge, and Love--form, as it were, the keynotes
of the new Sufism, and in the following chapters I shall endeavour to
show how they were developed. Ultimately they rest upon a pantheistic
faith which deposed the One transcendent God of Islam and worshipped in
His stead One Real Being who dwells and works everywhere, and whose
throne is not less, but more, in the human heart than in the heaven of
heavens. Before going further, it will be convenient to answer a
question which the reader may have asked himself--Whence did the Moslems
of the ninth century derive this doctrine?

Modern research has proved that the origin of Sufism cannot be traced
back to a single definite cause, and has thereby discredited the
sweeping generalisations which represent it, for instance, as a reaction
of the Aryan mind against a conquering Semitic religion, and as the
product, essentially, of Indian or Persian thought. Statements of this
kind, even when they are partially true, ignore the principle that in
order to establish an historical connexion between A and B, it is not
enough to bring

<span id="9"><span class="small">{p. 9}</span></span>

forward evidence of their likeness to one another, without showing at
the same time (1) that the actual relation of B to A was such as to
render the assumed filiation possible, and (2) that the possible
hypothesis fits in with all the ascertained and relevant facts. Now, the
theories which I have mentioned do not satisfy these conditions. If
Sufism was nothing but a revolt of the Aryan spirit, how are we to
explain the undoubted fact that some of the leading pioneers of
Mohammedan mysticism were natives of Syria and Egypt, and Arabs by race?
Similarly, the advocates of a Buddhistic or Vedantic origin forget that
the main current of Indian influence upon Islamic civilisation belongs
to a later epoch, whereas Moslem theology, philosophy, and science put
forth their first luxuriant shoots on a soil that was saturated with
Hellenistic culture. The truth is that Sufism is a complex thing, and
therefore no simple answer can be given to the question how it
originated. We shall have gone far, however, towards answering that
question when we have distinguished the various movements and forces
which moulded Sufism, and determined what direction it should take in
the early stages of its growth.

Let us first consider the most important external, *i.e.* non-Islamic,
influences.

<span id="10"><span class="small">{p. 10}</span></span>

I. CHRISTIANITY

It is obvious that the ascetic and quietistic tendencies to which I have
referred were in harmony with Christian theory and drew nourishment
therefrom. Many Gospel texts and apocryphal sayings of Jesus are cited
in the oldest Sufi biographies, and the Christian anchorite (*rahib*)
often appears in the rôle of a teacher giving instruction and advice to
wandering Moslem ascetics. We have seen that the woollen dress, from
which the name 'Sufi' is derived, is of Christian origin: vows of
silence, litanies (*dhikr*), and other ascetic practices may be traced
to the same source. As regards the doctrine of divine love, the
following extracts speak for themselves:

> "Jesus passed by three men. Their bodies were lean and their faces
> pale. He asked them, saying, 'What hath brought you to this plight?'
> They answered, 'Fear of the Fire.' Jesus said, 'Ye fear a thing
> created, and it behoves God that He should save those who fear.' Then
> he left them and passed by three others, whose faces were paler and
> their bodies leaner, and asked them, saying, 'What hath brought you to
> this plight?' They answered, 'Longing for Paradise.' He said, 'Ye

<span id="11"><span class="small">{p. 11}</span></span>

> desire a thing created, and it behoves God that He should give you
> that which ye hope for.' Then he went on and passed by three others of
> exceeding paleness and leanness, so that their faces were as mirrors
> of light, and he said, 'What hath brought you to this?' They answered,
> 'Our love of God.' Jesus said, 'Ye are the nearest to Him, ye are the
> nearest to Him.'"

The Syrian mystic, Ahmad ibn al-Hawari, once asked a Christian hermit:

> "'What is the strongest command that ye find in your Scriptures?' The
> hermit replied: 'We find none stronger than this: "Love thy Creator
> with all thy power and might."'"

Another hermit was asked by some Moslem ascetics:

> "'When is a man most persevering in devotion?' 'When love takes
> possession of his heart,' was the reply; 'for then he hath no joy or
> pleasure but in continual devotion.'"

The influence of Christianity through its hermits, monks, and heretical
sects (*e.g.* the Messalians or Euchitæ) was twofold: ascetic and
mystical. Oriental Christian mysticism, however, contained a Pagan
element: it had long ago absorbed the ideas and adopted the language of
Plotinus and the Neo-platonic school.

<span id="12"><span class="small">{p. 12}</span></span>

II\. NEOPLATONISM

Aristotle, not Plato, is the dominant figure in Moslem philosophy, and
few Mohammedans are familiar with the name of Plotinus, who was more
commonly called 'the Greek Master' (*al-Sheykh al-Yaunani*). But since
the Arabs gained their first knowledge of Aristotle from his
Neoplatonist commentators, the system with which they became imbued was
that of Porphyry and Proclus. Thus the so-called *Theology of
Aristotle*, of which an Arabic version appeared in the ninth century, is
actually a manual of Neoplatonism.

Another work of this school deserves particular notice: I mean the
writings falsely attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite, the convert of
St. Paul. The pseudo-Dionysius--he may have been a Syrian monk--names as
his teacher a certain Hierotheus, whom Frothingham has identified with
Stephen Bar Sudaili, a prominent Syrian gnostic and a contemporary of
Jacob of Saruj (451-521 A.D.). Dionysius quotes some fragments of erotic
hymns by this Stephen, and a complete work, the *Book of Hierotheus on
the Hidden Mysteries of the Divinity*, has come down to us in a unique
manuscript which is now in the British Museum. The Dionysian writings,
turned into Latin by John Scotus Erigena,

<span id="13"><span class="small">{p. 13}</span></span>

founded medieval Christian mysticism in Western Europe. Their influence
in the East was hardly less vital. They were translated from Greek into
Syriac almost immediately on their appearance, and their doctrine was
vigorously propagated by commentaries in the same tongue. "About 850
A.D. Dionysius was known from the Tigris to the Atlantic."

Besides literary tradition there were other channels by which the
doctrines of emanation, illumination, gnosis, and ecstasy were
transmitted, but enough has been said to convince the reader that Greek
mystical ideas were in the air and easily accessible to the Moslem
inhabitants of Western Asia and Egypt, where the Sufi theosophy first
took shape. One of those who bore the chief part in its development, Dhu
’l-Nun the Egyptian, is described as a philosopher and alchemist--in
other words, a student of Hellenistic science. When it is added that
much of his speculation agrees with what we find, for example, in the
writings of Dionysius, we are drawn irresistibly to the conclusion
(which, as I have pointed out, is highly probable on general grounds)
that Neoplatonism poured into Islam a large tincture of the same
mystical element in which Christianity was already steeped.

<span id="14"><span class="small">{p. 14}</span></span>

III\. GNOSTICISM  
<span class="small">{Cf. Goldziher, "Neuplatonische und gnostische
Elemente im Hadit," in *Zeitschrift für Assyriologie*, xxii. 317
ff.}</span>

Though little direct evidence is available, the conspicuous place
occupied by the theory of gnosis in early Sufi speculation suggests
contact with Christian Gnosticism, and it is worth noting that the
parents of Ma‘ruf al-Karkhi, whose definition of Sufism as 'the
apprehension of divine realities' was quoted on the first page of this
Introduction, are said to have been Sabians, *i.e.* Mandæans, dwelling
in the Babylonian fenland between Basra and Wasit. Other Moslem saints
had learned 'the mystery of the Great Name.' It was communicated to
Ibrahim ibn Adham by a man whom he met while travelling in the desert,
and as soon as he pronounced it he saw the prophet Khadir (Elias). The
ancient Sufis borrowed from the Manichæans the term *siddiq*, which they
apply to their own spiritual adepts, and a later school, returning to
the dualism of Mani, held the view that the diversity of phenomena
arises from the admixture of light and darkness.

> "The ideal of human action is freedom from the taint of darkness; and
> the freedom of light from darkness

<span id="15"><span class="small">{p. 15}</span></span>

> means the self-consciousness of light as light." <span
> class="small">{Shaikh Muhammad Iqbal, *The Development of Metaphysics
> in Persia* (1908), p. 150.}</span>

The following version of the doctrine of the seventy thousand veils as
explained by a modern Rifa‘i dervish shows clear traces of Gnosticism
and is so interesting that I cannot refrain from quoting it here:

> "Seventy Thousand Veils separate Allah, the One Reality, from the
> world of matter and of sense. And every soul passes before his birth
> through these seventy thousand. The inner half of these are veils of
> light: the outer half, veils of darkness. For every one of the veils
> of light passed through, in this journey towards birth, the soul puts
> *off* a divine quality: and for every one of the dark veils, it puts
> *on* an earthly quality. Thus the child is born *weeping*, for the
> soul knows its separation from Allah, the One Reality. And when the
> child cries in its sleep, it is because the soul remembers something
> of what it has lost. Otherwise, the passage through the veils has
> brought with it forgetfulness (*nisyan*): and for this reason man is
> called *insan*. He is now, as it were, in prison in his body,
> separated by these thick curtains from Allah.

<span id="16"><span class="small">{p. 16}</span></span>

\* \* \*

> "But the whole purpose of Sufism, the Way of the dervish, is to give
> him an escape from this prison, an apocalypse of the Seventy Thousand
> Veils, a recovery of the original unity with The One, *while still in
> this body*. The body is not to be put off; it is to be refined and
> made spiritual--a help and not a hindrance to the spirit. It is like a
> metal that has to be refined by fire and transmuted. And the sheikh

> will emerge refined.'" <span class="small">{*"The Way" of a Mohammedan
> Mystic*, by W. H. T. Gairdner (Leipzig, 1912), pp. 9 f.}</span>

IV\. BUDDHISM

Before the Mohammedan conquest of India in the eleventh century, the
teaching of Buddha exerted considerable influence in Eastern Persia and
Transoxania. We hear of flourishing Buddhist monasteries in Balkh, the
metropolis of ancient Bactria, a city famous for the number of Sufis who
resided in it. Professor Goldziher has called attention to the
significant circumstance that the Sufi ascetic, Ibrahim ibn Adham,
appears in Moslem legend as a prince of Balkh who abandoned his throne
and

<span id="17"><span class="small">{p. 17}</span></span>

became a wandering dervish--the story of Buddha over again. The Sufis
learned the use of rosaries from Buddhist monks, and, without entering
into details, it may be safely asserted that the method of Sufism, so
far as it is one of ethical self-culture, ascetic meditation, and
intellectual abstraction, owes a good deal to Buddhism. But the features
which the two systems have in common only accentuate the fundamental
difference between them. In spirit they are poles apart. The Buddhist
moralises himself, the Sufi becomes moral only through knowing and
loving God.

The Sufi conception of the passing-away (*fana*) of individual self in
Universal Being is certainly, I think, of Indian origin. Its first great
exponent was the Persian mystic, Bayazid of Bistam, who may have
received it from his teacher, Abu ‘Ali of Sind (Scinde). Here are some
of his sayings:

> "Creatures are subject to changing 'states,' but the gnostic has no
> 'state,' because his vestiges are effaced and his essence annihilated
> by the essence of another, and his traces are lost in another's
> traces."

> "Thirty years the high God was my mirror, now I am my own mirror,"
> *i.e.* according to the explanation given by his biographer, "that
> which I was I am no more, for 'I' and 'God' is a denial

<span id="18"><span class="small">{p. 18}</span></span>

> of the unity of God. Since I am no more, the high God is His own
> mirror."

> "I went from God to God, until they cried from me in me, 'O Thou I!'"

This, it will be observed, is not Buddhism, but the pantheism of the
Vedanta. We cannot identify *fana* with Nirvana unconditionally. Both
terms imply the passing-away of individuality, but while Nirvana is
purely negative, *fana* is accompanied by *baqa*, everlasting life in
God. The rapture of the Sufi who has lost himself in ecstatic
contemplation of the divine beauty is entirely opposed to the
passionless intellectual serenity of the Arahat. I emphasise this
contrast because, in my opinion, the influence of Buddhism on Mohammedan
thought has been exaggerated. Much is attributed to Buddhism that is
Indian rather than specifically Buddhistic: the *fana* theory of the
Sufis is a case in point. Ordinary Moslems held the followers of Buddha
in abhorrence, regarding them as idolaters, and were not likely to seek
personal intercourse with them. On the other hand, for nearly a thousand
years before the Mohammedan conquest, Buddhism had been powerful in
Bactria and Eastern Persia generally: it must, therefore, have affected
the development of Sufism in these regions.

While *fana* in its pantheistic form is

<span id="19"><span class="small">{p. 19}</span></span>

radically different from Nirvana, the terms coincide so closely in other
ways that we cannot regard them as being altogether unconnected. *Fana*
has an ethical aspect: it involves the extinction of all passions and
desires. The passing-away of evil qualities and of the evil actions
which they produce is said to be brought about by the continuance of the
corresponding good qualities and actions. Compare this with the
definition of Nirvana given by Professor Rhys Davids:

> "The extinction of that sinful, grasping condition of mind and heart,
> which would otherwise, according to the great mystery of Karma, be the
> cause of renewed individual existence. That extinction is to be
> brought about by, and runs parallel with, the growth of the opposite
> condition of mind and heart; and it is complete when that opposite
> condition is reached."

Apart from the doctrine of Karma, which is alien to Sufism, these
definitions of *fana* (viewed as a moral state) and Nirvana, agree
almost word for word. It would be out of place to pursue the comparison
further, but I think we may conclude that the Sufi theory of *fana* was
influenced to some extent by Buddhism as well as by Perso-Indian
pantheism.

The receptivity of Islam to foreign ideas has been recognised by every
unbiassed

<span id="20"><span class="small">{p. 20}</span></span>

inquirer, and the history of Sufism is only a single instance of the
general rule. But this fact should not lead us to seek in such ideas an
explanation of the whole question which I am now discussing, or to
identify Sufism itself with the extraneous ingredients which it absorbed
and assimilated in the course of its development. Even if Islam had been
miraculously shut off from contact with foreign religions and
philosophies, some form of mysticism would have arisen within it, for
the seeds were already there. Of course, we cannot isolate the internal
forces working in this direction, since they were subject to the law of
spiritual gravitation. The powerful currents of thought discharged
through the Mohammedan world by the great non-lslamic systems above
mentioned gave a stimulus to various tendencies within Islam which
affected Sufism either positively or negatively. As we have seen, its
oldest type is an ascetic revolt against luxury and worldliness; later
on, the prevailing rationalism and scepticism provoked counter-movements
towards intuitive knowledge and emotional faith, and also an orthodox
reaction which in its turn drove many earnest Moslems into the ranks of
the mystics.

How, it may be asked, could a religion founded on the simple and austere
monotheism of Mohammed tolerate these new

<span id="21"><span class="small">{p. 21}</span></span>

doctrines, much less make terms with them? It would seem impossible to
reconcile the transcendent personality of Allah with an immanent Reality
which is the very life and soul of the universe. Yet Islam has accepted
Sufism. The Sufis, instead of being excommunicated, are securely
established in the Mohammedan church, and the *Legend of the Moslem
Saints* records the wildest excesses of Oriental pantheism.

Let us return for a moment to the Koran, that infallible touchstone by
which every Mohammedan theory and practice must be proved. Are any germs
of mysticism to be found there? The Koran, as I have said, starts with
the notion of Allah, the One, Eternal, and Almighty God, far above human
feelings and aspirations--the Lord of His slaves, not the Father of His
children; a judge meting out stern justice to sinners, and extending His
mercy only to those who avert His wrath by repentance, humility, and
unceasing works of devotion; a God of fear rather than of love. This is
one side, and certainly the most prominent side, of Mohammed's teaching;
but while he set an impassable gulf between the world and Allah, his
deeper instinct craved a direct revelation from God to the soul. There
are no contradictions in the logic of feeling. Mohammed, who had in him
something of the mystic, felt God both as far and

<span id="22"><span class="small">{p. 22}</span></span>

near, both as transcendent and immanent. In the latter aspect, Allah is
the light of the heavens and the earth, a Being who works in the world
and in the soul of man.

> "If My servants ask thee about Me, lo, I am near" ([Kor.
> 2.182](../pick/002.htm#002_186)); "We (God.md) are nearer to him than his
> own neck-vein" ([50.15](../pick/050.htm#050_016).md); "And in the earth
> are signs to those of real faith, and in yourselves. What! do ye not
> see?" ([51.20-21](../pick/051.htm#051_020).md).

It was a long time ere they saw. The Moslem consciousness, haunted by
terrible visions of the wrath to come, slowly and painfully awoke to the
significance of those liberating ideas.

The verses which I have quoted do not stand alone, and however
unfavourable to mysticism the Koran as a whole may be, I cannot assent
to the view that it supplies no basis for a mystical interpretation of
Islam. This was worked out in detail by the Sufis, who dealt with the
Koran in very much the same way as Philo treated the Pentateuch. But
they would not have succeeded so thoroughly in bringing over the mass of
religious Moslems to their side, unless the champions of orthodoxy had
set about constructing a system of scholastic philosophy that reduced
the divine nature to a purely formal, changeless, and absolute unity, a
bare will devoid of all affections

<span id="23"><span class="small">{p. 23}</span></span>

and emotions, a tremendous and incalculable power with which no human
creature could have any communion or personal intercourse whatsoever.
That is the God of Mohammedan theology. That was the alternative to
Sufism. Therefore, "all thinking, religious Moslems are mystics," as
Professor D. B. Macdonald, one of our best authorities on the subject,
has remarked. And he adds: "All, too, are pantheists, but some do not
know it."

The relation of individual Sufis to Islam varies from more or less
entire conformity to a merely nominal profession of belief in Allah and
His Prophet. While the Koran and the Traditions are generally
acknowledged to be the unalterable standard of religious truth, this
acknowledgment does not include the recognition of any external
authority which shall decide what is orthodox and what is heretical.
Creeds and catechisms count for nothing in the Sufi's estimation. Why
should he concern himself with these when he possesses a doctrine
derived immediately from God? As he reads the Koran with studious
meditation and rapt attention, lo, the hidden meanings--infinite,
inexhaustible--of the Holy Word flash upon his inward eye. This is what
the Sufis call *istinbat*, a sort of intuitive deduction; the mysterious
inflow of divinely revealed knowledge into hearts made pure

<span id="24"><span class="small">{p. 24}</span></span>

by repentance and filled with the thought of God, and the outflow of
that knowledge upon the interpreting tongue. Naturally, the doctrines
elicited by means of *istinbat* do not agree very well either with
Mohammedan theology or with each other, but the discord is easily
explained. Theologians, who interpret the letter, cannot be expected to
reach the same conclusions as mystics, who interpret the spirit; and if
both classes differ amongst themselves, that is a merciful dispensation
of divine wisdom, since theological controversy serves to extinguish
religious error, while the variety of mystical truth corresponds to the
manifold degrees and modes of mystical experience.

In the chapter on the gnosis I shall enter more fully into the attitude
of the Sufis towards positive religion. It is only a rough-and-ready
account of the matter to say that many of them have been good Moslems,
many scarcely Moslems at all, and a third party, perhaps the largest,
Moslems after a fashion. During the early Middle Ages Islam was a
growing organism, and gradually became transformed under the influence
of diverse movements, of which Sufism itself was one. Mohammedan
orthodoxy in its present shape owes much to Ghazali, and Ghazali was a
Sufi. Through his work and example the Sufistic inter-

<span id="25"><span class="small">{p. 25}</span></span>

pretation of Islam has in no small measure been harmonised with the
rival claims of reason and tradition, but just because of this he is
less valuable than mystics of a purer type to the student who wishes to
know what Sufism essentially is.

Although the numerous definitions of Sufism which occur in Arabic and
Persian books on the subject are historically interesting, their chief
importance lies in showing that Sufism is undefinable. Jalaluddin Rumi
in his *Masnavi* tells a story about an elephant which some Hindoos were
exhibiting in a dark room. Many people gathered to see it, but, as the
place was too dark to permit them to see the elephant, they all felt it
with their hands, to gain an idea of what it was like. One felt its
trunk, and said that the animal resembled a water-pipe; another felt its
ear, and said it must be a large fan; another its leg, and thought it
must be a pillar; another felt its back, and declared that the beast
must be like an immense throne. So it is with those who define Sufism:
they can only attempt to express what they themselves have felt, and
there is no conceivable formula that will comprise every shade of
personal and intimate religious feeling. Since, however, these
definitions illustrate with convenient brevity certain aspects and
characteristics of Sufism, a few specimens may be given.

<span id="26"><span class="small">{p. 26}</span></span>

\* \* \*

> "It is Sufism to put away what thou hast in thy head, to give what

The reader will perceive that Sufism is a word uniting many divergent
meanings, and that in sketching its main features one is obliged to make
a sort of composite portrait, which does not represent any particular
type exclusively. The Sufis are not a sect, they have no dogmatic
system, the *tariqas* or paths by which they seek God "are in number as
the souls of men" and vary infinitely, though a family likeness may be
traced in them all. Descriptions of such a Protean phenomenon must
differ widely from one another, and the impression produced in each case
will depend on the choice of materials and the prominence given to this
or that aspect of the many-sided whole. Now, the essence of Sufism is
best displayed in its extreme type, which is pantheistic and speculative
rather than ascetic or devotional. This type, therefore, I have
purposely placed in the foreground. The advantage of limiting the field
is obvious enough, but entails some loss of proportion. In order to form
a fair judgment of Mohammedan mysticism, the following chapters should
be supplemented by a companion picture drawn especially from those
moderate types which, for want of space, I have unduly neglected.

## CHAPTER I

### THE PATH

MYSTICS of every race and creed have described the progress of the
spiritual life as a Journey or a pilgrimage. Other symbols have been
used for the same purpose, but this one appears to be almost universal
in its range. The Sufi who sets out to seek God calls himself a
'traveller' (*salik*); he advances by slow 'stages' (*maqamat*) along a
'path' (*tariqat*) to the goal of union with Reality (*fana fi
’l-Haqq*). Should he venture to make a map of this interior ascent, it
will not correspond exactly with any of those made by previous
explorers. Such maps or scales of perfection were elaborated by Sufi
teachers at an early period, and the unlucky Moslem habit of
systematising has produced an enormous aftercrop. The 'path' expounded
by the author of the *Kitab al-Luma‘*, perhaps the oldest comprehensive
treatise on Sufism that we now possess, consists of the following seven
'stages', each of which (except the first member of the series) is the
result of the 'stages' immediately

<span id="29"><span class="small">{p. 29}</span></span>

preceding it--(l) Repentance, (2) abstinence, (3) renunciation, (4)
poverty, (5) patience, (6) trust in God, (7) satisfaction. The 'stages'
constitute the *ascetic and ethical* discipline of the Sufi, and must be
carefully distinguished from the so-called 'states' (*ahwal*, plural of
*hal*), which form a similar *psychological* chain. The writer whom I
have just quoted enumerates ten 'states'--Meditation, nearness to God,
love, fear, hope, longing, intimacy, tranquillity, contemplation, and
certainty. While the 'stages' can be acquired and mastered by one's own
efforts, the 'states' are spiritual feelings and dispositions over which
a man has no control:

> "They descend from God into his heart, without his being able to repel
> them when they come or to retain them when they go."

The Sufi's 'path' is not finished until he has traversed all the
'stages,' making himself perfect in every one of them before advancing
to the next, and has also experienced whatever 'states' it pleases God
to bestow upon him. Then, and only then, is he permanently raised to the
higher planes of consciousness which Sufis call 'the Gnosis'
(*ma‘rifat*) and 'the Truth' (*haqiqat*), where the 'seeker' (*talib*)
becomes the 'knower' or 'gnostic' (*‘arif*), and realises that
knowledge, knower, and known are One.

<span id="30"><span class="small">{p. 30}</span></span>

\* \* \*

Having sketched, as briefly as possible, the external framework of the
method by which the Sufi approaches his goal, I shall now try to give
some account of its inner workings. The present chapter deals with the
first portion of the threefold journey--the Path, the Gnosis, and the
Truth--by which the quest of Reality is often symbolised.

The first place in every list of 'stages' is occupied by repentance
(*tawbat*). This is the Moslem term for 'conversion,' and marks the
beginning of a new life. In the biographies of eminent Sufis the dreams,
visions, auditions, and other experiences which caused them to enter on
the Path are usually related. Trivial as they may seem, these records
have a psychological basis, and, if authentic, would be worth studying
in detail. Repentance is described as the awakening of the soul from the
slumber of heedlessness, so that the sinner becomes aware of his evil
ways and feels contrition for past disobedience. He is not truly
penitent, however, unless (1) he at once abandons the sin or sins of
which he is conscious, and (2) firmly resolves that he will never return
to these sins in the future. It he should fail to keep his vow, he must
again turn to God, whose mercy is infinite. A certain well-known Sufi
repented seventy times and fell back into sin seventy times before he
made a

<span id="31"><span class="small">{p. 31}</span></span>

lasting repentance. The convert must also, as far as lies in his power,
satisfy all those whom he has injured. Many examples of such restitution
might be culled from the *Legend of the Moslem Saints*.

According to the high mystical theory, repentance is purely an act of
divine grace, coming from God to man, not from man to God. Some one said
to Rabi‘a:

> "I have committed many sins; if I turn in penitence towards God, will
> He turn in mercy towards me?" "Nay," she replied," but if He shall
> turn towards thee, thou wilt turn towards Him."

The question whether sins ought to be remembered after repentance or
forgotten illustrates a fundamental point in Sufi ethics: I mean the
difference between what is taught to novices and disciples and what is
held as an esoteric doctrine by adepts. Any Mohammedan director of souls
would tell his pupils that to think humbly and remorsefully of one's
sins is a sovereign remedy against spiritual pride, but he himself might
very well believe that real repentance consists in forgetting everything
except God.

> "The penitent," says Hujwiri, "is a lover of God, and the lover of God
> is in contemplation of God: in contemplation it is wrong to remember

<span id="32"><span class="small">{p. 32}</span></span>

> sin, for recollection of sin is a veil between God and the
> contemplative."

Sin appertains to self-existence, which itself is the greatest of all
sins. To forget sin is to forget self.

This is only one application of a principle which, as I have said, runs
through the whole ethical system of Sufism and will be more fully
explained in a subsequent chapter. Its dangers are evident, but we must
in fairness allow that the same theory of conduct may not be equally
suitable to those who have made themselves perfect in moral discipline
and to those who are still striving after perfection.

Over the gate of repentance it is written:

> "All *self* abandon ye who enter here!"

The convert now begins what is called by Christian mystics the Purgative
Way. If he follows the general rule, he will take a director (Sheykh,
Pir, Murshid), *i.e.* a holy man of ripe experience and profound
knowledge, whose least word is absolute law to his disciples. A 'seeker'
who attempts to traverse the 'Path' without assistance receives little
sympathy. Of such a one it is said that 'his guide is Satan,' and he is
likened to a tree that for want of the gardener's care brings forth
'none or bitter fruit.' Speaking of the Sufi Sheykhs, Hujwiri says:

<span id="33"><span class="small">{p. 33}</span></span>

\* \* \*

> "When a novice joins them, with the purpose of renouncing the world,
> they subject him to spiritual discipline for the space of three years.
> If he fulfil the requirements of this discipline, well and good;
> otherwise, they declare that he cannot be admitted to the 'Path.' The
> first year is devoted to service of the people, the second year to
> service of God, and the third year to watching over his own heart. He
> can serve the people, only when he places himself in the rank of
> servants and all others in the rank of masters, *i.e.* he must regard
> all, without exception, as being better than himself, and must deem it
> his duty to serve all alike. And he can serve God, only when he cuts
> off all his selfish interests relating either to the present or to the
> future life, and worships God for God's sake alone, inasmuch as
> whoever worships God for any thing's sake worships himself, not God.
> And he can watch over his heart, only when his thoughts are collected
> and every care is dismissed, so that in communion with God he guards
> his heart from the assaults of heedlessness. When these qualifications
> are possessed by the novice, he may wear the *muraqqa‘at* (the patched
> frock worn by dervishes) as a true

<span id="34"><span class="small">{p. 34}</span></span>

> mystic, not merely as an imitator of others."

Shibli was a pupil of the famous theosophist Junayd of Baghdad. On his
conversion, he came to Junayd, saying:

> "They tell me that you possess the pearl of divine knowledge: either
> give it me or sell it." Junayd answered: "I cannot sell it, for you
> have not the price thereof; and if I give it you, you will have gained
> it cheaply. You do not know its value. Cast yourself headlong, like
> me, into this ocean, in order that you may win the pearl by waiting
> patiently."

Shibli asked what he must do.

> "Go," said Junayd, "and sell sulphur."

At the end of a year he said to Shibli:

> "This trading makes you well known. Become a dervish and occupy
> yourself solely with begging."

During a whole year Shibli wandered through the streets of Baghdad,
begging of the passers-by, but no one heeded him. Then he returned to
Junayd, who exclaimed:

> "See now! You are nothing in people's eyes. Never set your mind on
> them or take any account of them at all. For some time" (he continued)
> "you were a chamberlain and acted as

<span id="35"><span class="small">{p. 35}</span></span>

> governor of a province. Go to that country and ask pardon of all those
> whom you have wronged."

Shibli obeyed and spent four years in going from door to door, until he
had obtained an acquittance from every person except one, whom he failed
to trace. On his return, Junayd said to him:

> "You still have some regard to reputation. Go and be a beggar for one
> year more."

Every day Shibli used to bring the alms that were given him to Junayd,
who bestowed them on the poor and kept Shibli without food until the
next morning. When a year had passed in this way, Junayd accepted him as
one of his disciples on condition that he should perform the duties of a
servant to the others. After a year's service, Junayd asked him:

> "What think you of yourself now?" Shibli replied: "I deem myself the
> meanest of God's creatures." " Now," said the master, "your faith is
> firm."

I need not dwell on the details of this training--the fasts and vigils,
the vows of silence, the long days and nights of solitary meditation,
all the weapons and tactics, in short, of that battle against one's self
which the Prophet declared to be more painful and meritorious than the
Holy War. On the other hand, my readers will expect me to

<span id="36"><span class="small">{p. 36}</span></span>

describe in a general way the characteristic theories and practices for
which the 'Path' is a convenient designation. These may be treated under
the following heads: Poverty, Mortification, Trust in God, and
Recollection. Whereas poverty is negative in nature, involving
detachment from all that is worldly and unreal, the three remaining
terms denote the positive counterpart of that process, namely, the
ethical discipline by which the soul is brought into harmonious
relations with Reality.

The fatalistic spirit which brooded darkly over the childhood of
Islam--the feeling that all human actions are determined by an unseen
Power, and in themselves are worthless and vain--caused renunciation to
become the watchword of early Moslem asceticism. Every true believer is
bound to abstain from unlawful pleasures, but the ascetic acquires merit
by abstaining from those which are lawful. At first, renunciation was
understood almost exclusively in a material sense. To have as few
worldly goods as possible seemed the surest means of gaining salvation.
Dawud al-Ta’i owned nothing except a mat of rushes, a brick which he
used as a pillow, and a leathern vessel which served him for drinking
and washing. A certain man dreamed that he saw Malik ibn Dinar and
Mohammed ibn Wasi‘ being led into Para-

<span id="37"><span class="small">{p. 37}</span></span>

dise, and that Malik was admitted before his companion. He cried out in
astonishment, for he thought Mohammed ibn Wasi‘ had a superior claim to
the honour. "Yes," came the answer, "but Mohammed ibn Wasi‘ possessed
two shirts, and Malik only one. That is the reason why Malik is
preferred."

The Sufi ideal of poverty goes far beyond this. True poverty is not
merely lack of wealth, but lack of desire for wealth: the empty heart as
well as the empty hand. The 'poor man' (*faqir*) and the 'mendicant'
(*dervish*) are names by which the Mohammedan mystic is proud to be
known, because they imply that he is stripped of every thought or wish
that would divert his mind from God. "To be severed entirely from both
the present life and the future life, and to want nothing besides the
Lord of the present life and the future life--that is to be truly poor."
Such a *faqir* is denuded of individual existence, so that he does not
attribute to himself any action, feeling, or quality. He may even be
rich, in the common meaning of the word, though spiritually he is the
poorest of the poor; for, sometimes, God endows His saints with an
outward show of wealth and worldliness in order to hide them from the
profane.

No one familiar with the mystical writers will need to be informed that
their terminology is ambiguous, and that the same word

<span id="38"><span class="small">{p. 38}</span></span>

frequently covers a group, if not a multitude, of significations
diverging more or less widely according to the aspect from which it is
viewed. Hence the confusion that is apparent in Sufi text-books. When
'poverty,' for example, is explained by one interpreter as a
transcendental theory and by another as a practical rule of religious
life, the meanings cannot coincide. Regarded from the latter standpoint,
poverty is only the beginning of Sufism. *Faqirs*, Jami says, renounce
all worldly things for the sake of pleasing God. They are urged to this
sacrifice by one of three motives: (a) Hope of an easy reckoning on the
Day of Judgment, or fear of being punished; (b) desire of Paradise; (c)
longing for spiritual peace and inward composure. Thus, inasmuch as they
are not disinterested but seek to benefit themselves, they rank below
the Sufi, who has no will of his own and depends absolutely on the will
of God. It is the absence of 'self' that distinguishes the Sufi from the
*faqir*.

Here are some maxims for dervishes:

> "Do not beg unless you are starving. The Caliph Omar flogged a man who
> begged after having satisfied his hunger. When compelled to beg, do
> not accept more than you need."

> "Be good-natured and uncomplaining and thank God for your poverty."

<span id="39"><span class="small">{p. 39}</span></span>

\* \* \*

> "Do not flatter the rich for giving, nor blame them for withholding."

> "Dread the loss of poverty more than the rich man dreads the loss of
> wealth."

> "Take what is voluntarily offered: it is the daily bread which God
> sends to you: do not refuse God's gift."

> "Let no thought of the morrow enter your mind, else you will incur
> everlasting perdition."

> "Do not make God a springe to catch alms."

The Sufi teachers gradually built up a system of asceticism and moral
culture which is founded on the fact that there is in man an element of
evil--the lower or appetitive soul. This evil self, the seat of passion
and lust, is called *nafs*; it may be considered broadly equivalent to
'the flesh,' and with its allies, the world and the devil, it
constitutes the great obstacle to the attainment of union with God. The
Prophet said: "Thy worst enemy is thy *nafs*, which is between thy two
sides." I do not intend to discuss the various opinions as to its
nature, but the proof of its materiality is too curious to be omitted.
Mohammed ibn ‘Ulyan, an eminent Sufi, relates that one day something
like a young fox came forth from his throat, and God caused him to know
that

<span id="40"><span class="small">{p. 40}</span></span>

it was his *nafs*. He trod on it, but it grew bigger at every kick that
he gave it. He said:

> "Other things are destroyed by pain and blows: why dost thou
> increase?" " Because I was created perverse," it replied; "what is
> pain to other things is pleasure to me, and their pleasure is my
> pain."

The *nafs* of Hallaj was seen running behind him in the shape of a dog;
and other cases are recorded in which it appeared as a snake or a mouse.

Mortification of the *nafs* is the chief work of devotion, and leads,
directly or indirectly, to the contemplative life. All the Sheykhs are
agreed that no disciple who neglects this duty will ever learn the
rudiments of Sufism. The principle of mortification is that the *nafs*
should be weaned from those things to which it is accustomed, that it
should be encouraged to resist its passions, that its pride should be
broken, and that it should be brought through suffering and tribulation
to recognise the vileness of its original nature and the impurity of its
actions. Concerning the outward methods of mortification, such as
fasting, silence, and solitude, a great deal might be written, but we
must now pass on to the higher ethical discipline which completes the
Path.

Self-mortification, as advanced Sufis

<span id="41"><span class="small">{p. 41}</span></span>

understand it, is a moral transmutation of the inner man. When they say,
"Die before ye die," they do not mean to assert that the lower self can
be essentially destroyed, but that it can and should be purged of its
attributes, which are wholly evil. These attributes--ignorance, pride,
envy, uncharitableness, etc.--are extinguished, and replaced by the
opposite qualities, when the will is surrendered to God and when the
mind is concentrated on Him. Therefore 'dying to self' is really 'living
in God.' The mystical aspects of the doctrine thus stated will occupy a
considerable part of the following chapters; here we are mainly
interested in its ethical import.

The Sufi who has eradicated self-will is said, in technical language, to
have reached the 'stages' of 'acquiescence' or 'satisfaction' (*rida*)
and 'trust in God' (*tawakkul*).

> A dervish fell into the Tigris. Seeing that he could not swim, a man
> on the bank cried out, "Shall I tell some one to bring you ashore?"
> "No," said the dervish. "Then do you wish to be drowned?" "No." "What,
> then, do you wish?" The dervish replied, "God's will be done! What
> have I to do with wishing?"

'Trust in God,' in its extreme form, involves the renunciation of every
personal initiative and volition; total passivity like

<span id="42"><span class="small">{p. 42}</span></span>

that of a corpse in the hands of the washer who prepares it for burial;
perfect indifference towards anything that is even remotely connected
with one's self. A special class of the ancient Sufis took their name
from this 'trust,' which they applied, so far as they were able, to
matters of everyday life. For instance, they would not seek food, work
for hire, practise any trade, or allow medicine to be given them when
they were ill. Quietly they committed themselves to God's care, never
doubting that He, to whom belong the treasures of earth and heaven,
would provide for their wants, and that their allotted portion would
come to them as surely as it comes to the birds, which neither sow nor
reap, and to the fish in the sea, and to the child in the womb.

These principles depend ultimately on the Sufistic theory of the divine
unity, as is shown by Shaqiq of Balkh in the following passage:

> "There are three things which a man is bound to practise. Whosoever
> neglects any one of them must needs neglect them all, and whosoever
> cleaves to any one of them must needs cleave to them all. Strive,
> therefore, to understand, and consider heedfully,

> "The *first* is this, that with your mind and your tongue and your
> actions you declare God to be One; and that,

<span id="43"><span class="small">{p. 43}</span></span>

> having declared Him to be One, and having declared that none benefits
> you or harms you except Him, you devote all your actions to Him alone.
> If you act a single jot of your actions for the sake of another, your
> thought and speech are corrupt, since your motive in acting for
> another's sake must be hope or fear; and when you act from hope or
> fear of other than God, who is the lord and sustainer of all things,
> you have taken to yourself another god to honour and venerate.

> "*Secondly*, that while you speak and act in the sincere belief that
> there is no God except Him, you should trust Him more than the world
> or money or uncle or father or mother or any one on the face of the
> earth.

> "*Thirdly*, when you have established these two things, namely,
> sincere belief in the unity of God and trust in Him, it behoves you to
> be satisfied with Him and not to be angry on account of anything that
> vexes you. Beware of anger! Let your heart be with Him always, let it
> not be withdrawn from Him for a single moment."

The 'trusting' Sufi has no thought beyond the present hour. On one
occasion Shaqiq asked those who sat listening to his discourse:

<span id="44"><span class="small">{p. 44}</span></span>

\* \* \*

> "If God causes you to die to-day, think ye that He will demand from
> you the prayers of to-morrow?" They answered: "No; how should He
> demand from us the prayers of a day on which we are not alive?" Shaqiq
> said: "Even as He will not demand from you the prayers of to-morrow,
> so do ye not seek from Him the provender of to-morrow. It may be that
> ye will not live so long."

In view of the practical consequences of attempting to live 'on trust,'
it is not surprising to read the advice given to those who would
perfectly fulfil the doctrine: "Let them dig a grave and bury
themselves." Later Sufis hold that active exertion for the purpose of
obtaining the means of subsistence is quite compatible with 'trust,'
according to the saying of the Prophet, "Trust in God and tie the
camel's leg." They define *tawakkul* as an habitual state of mind, which
is impaired only by self-pleasing thoughts; *e.g.* it was accounted a
breach of 'trust' to think Paradise a more desirable place than Hell.

What type of character is such a theory likely to produce? At the worst,
a useless drone and hypocrite preying upon his fellow-creatures; at the
best, a harmless dervish who remains unmoved in the midst of sorrow,
meets praise and blame with equal

<span id="45"><span class="small">{p. 45}</span></span>

indifference, and accepts insults, blows, torture, and death as mere
incidents in the eternal drama of destiny. This cold morality, however,
is not the highest of which Sufism is capable. The highest morality
springs from nothing but love, when self-surrender becomes
self-devotion. Of that I shall have something to say in due time.

Among the positive elements in the Sufi discipline there is one that
Moslem mystics unanimously regard as the keystone of practical religion.
I refer to the *dhikr*, an exercise well known to Western readers from
the careful description given by Edward Lane in his *Modern Egyptians*,
and by Professor D. B. Macdonald in his recently published *Aspects of
Islam*. The term *dhikr*--'recollection' seems to me the most
appropriate equivalent in English--signifies 'mentioning,'
'remembering,' or simply 'thinking of'; in the Koran the Faithful are
commanded to "remember God often," a plain act of worship without any
mystical savour. But the Sufis made a practice of repeating the name of
God or some religious formula, *e.g.* "Glory to Allah" (*subhan Allah*),
"There is no god but Allah" (*la ilaha illa ’llah*), accompanying the
mechanical intonation with an intense concentration of every faculty
upon the single word or phrase; and they attach greater value to this
irregular

<span id="46"><span class="small">{p. 46}</span></span>

litany, which enables them to enjoy uninterrupted communion with God,
than to the five services of prayer performed, at fixed hours of the day
and night, by all Moslems. Recollection may be either spoken or silent,
but it is best, according to the usual opinion, that tongue and mind
should co-operate. Sahl ibn ‘Abdallah bade one of his disciples
endeavour to say "Allah! Allah!" the whole day without intermission.
When he had acquired the habit of doing so, Sahl instructed him to
repeat the same words during the night, until they came forth from his
lips even while he was asleep. "Now," said he, "be silent and occupy
yourself with recollecting them." At last the disciple's whole being was
absorbed by the thought of Allah. One day a log fell on his head, and
the words "Allah, Allah" were seen written in the blood that trickled
from the wound.

Ghazali describes the method and effects of *dhikr* in a passage which
Macdonald has summarised as follows:

> "Let him reduce his heart to a state in which the existence of
> anything and its non-existence are the same to him. Then let him sit

<span id="48"><span class="small">{p. 48}</span></span>

> abides and sometimes it is momentary. And if it abides, sometimes its
> abiding is long, and sometimes short."

Another Sufi puts the gist of the matter in a sentence, thus:

> "The first stage of *dhikr* is to forget self, and the last stage is
> the effacement of the worshipper in the act of worship, without
> consciousness of worship, and such absorption in the object of worship
> as precludes return to the subject thereof."

Recollection can be aided in various ways. When Shibli was a novice, he
went daily into a cellar, taking with him a bundle of sticks. If his
attention flagged, he would beat himself until the sticks broke, and
sometimes the whole bundle would be finished before evening; then he
would dash his hands and feet against the wall. The Indian practice of
inhaling and exhaling the breath was known to the Sufis of the ninth
century and was much used afterwards. Among the Dervish Orders music,
singing, and dancing are favourite means of inducing the state of trance
called 'passing-away' (*fana*), which, as appears from the definition
quoted above, is the climax and *raison d'être* of the method.

In 'meditation' (*muraqabat*) we recognise a form of self-concentration
similar to the Buddhistic *dhyana* and *samadhi*. This is

<span id="49"><span class="small">{p. 49}</span></span>

what the Prophet meant when he said, "Worship God as though thou sawest
Him, for if thou seest Him not, yet He sees thee." Anyone who feels sure
that God is always watching over him will devote himself to meditating
on God, and no evil thoughts or diabolic suggestions will find their way
into his heart. Nuri used to meditate so intently that not a hair on his
body stirred. He declared that he had learned this habit from a cat
which was observing a mouse-hole, and that she was far more quiet than
he. Abu Sa‘id ibn Abi ’l-Khayr kept his eyes fixed on his navel. It is
said that the Devil is smitten with epilepsy when he approaches a man
thus occupied, just as happens to other men when the Devil takes
possession of them.

This chapter will have served its purpose if it has brought before my
readers a clear view of the main lines on which the preparatory training
of the Sufi is conducted. We must now imagine him to have been invested
by his Sheykh with the patched frock (*muraqqa‘at* or *khirqat*), which
is an outward sign that he has successfully emerged from the discipline
of the 'Path,' and is now advancing with uncertain steps towards the
Light, as when toil-worn travellers, having gained the summit of a deep
gorge, suddenly catch glimpses of the sun and cover their eyes.

## CHAPTER II

### ILLUMINATION AND ECSTASY

GOD, who is described in the Koran as "the Light of the heavens and the
earth," cannot be seen by the bodily eye. He is visible only to the
inward sight of the 'heart.' In the next chapter we shall return to this
spiritual organ, but I am not going to enter into the intricacies of
Sufi psychology any further than is necessary. The 'vision of the heart'
(*ru’yat al-qalb*) is defined as "the heart's beholding by the light of
certainty that which is hidden in the unseen world." This is what ‘Ali
meant when he was asked, "Do you see God?" and replied: "How should we
worship One whom we do not see?" The light of intuitive certainty
(*yaqin*) by which the heart sees God is a beam of God's own light cast
therein by Himself; else no vision of Him were possible.

> "'Tis the sun's self that lets the sun be seen."

According to a mystical interpretation of the famous passage in the
Koran where the light of Allah is compared to a candle

<span id="51"><span class="small">{p. 51}</span></span>

burning in a lantern of transparent glass, which is placed in a niche in
the wall, the niche is the true believer's heart; therefore his speech
is light and his works are light and he moves in light. "He who
discourses of eternity," said Bayazid, "must have within him the lamp of
eternity."

The light which gleams in the heart of the illuminated mystic endows him
with a supernatural power of discernment (*firasat*). Although the
Sufis, like all other Moslems, acknowledge Mohammed to be the last of
the prophets (as, from a different point of view, he is the Logos or
first of created beings), they really claim to possess a minor form of
inspiration. When Nuri was questioned concerning the origin of mystical
*firasat*, he answered by quoting the Koranic verse in which God says
that He breathed His spirit into Adam; but the more orthodox Sufis, who
strenously combat the doctrine that the human spirit is uncreated and
eternal, affirm that *firasat* is the result of knowledge and insight,
metaphorically called 'light' or 'inspiration,' which God creates and
bestows upon His favourites. The Tradition, "Beware of the discernment
of the true believer, for he sees by the light of Allah," is exemplified
in such anecdotes as these:

Abu ‘Abdallah al-Razi said:

> "Ibn al-Anbari presented me with a

<span id="52"><span class="small">{p. 52}</span></span>

> woollen frock, and seeing on the head of Shibli a bonnet that would
> just match it, I conceived the wish that they were both mine. When
> Shibli rose to depart, he looked at me, as he was in the habit of
> doing when he desired me to follow him. So I followed him to his
> house, and when we had gone in, he bade me put off the frock and took
> it from me and folded it and threw his bonnet on the top. Then he
> called for a fire and burnt both frock and bonnet."

Sari al-Saqati frequently urged Junayd to speak in public, but Junayd
was unwilling to consent, for he doubted whether he was worthy of such
an honour. One Friday night he dreamed that the Prophet appeared and
commanded him to speak to the people. He awoke and went to Sari's house
before daybreak, and knocked at the door. Sari opened the door and said:
"You would not believe me until the Prophet came and told you."

Sahl ibn ‘Abdallah was sitting in the congregational mosque when a
pigeon, overcome by the intense heat, dropped on the floor. Sahl
exclaimed: "Please God, Shah al-Kirmani has just died." They wrote it
down, and it was found to be true.

When the heart is purged of sin and evil thoughts, the light of
certainty strikes upon

<span id="53"><span class="small">{p. 53}</span></span>

it and makes it a shining mirror, so that the Devil cannot approach it
without being observed. Hence the saying of some gnostic: "If I disobey
my heart, I disobey God." It was a man thus illuminated to whom the
Prophet said: "Consult thy heart, and thou wilt hear the secret
ordinance of God proclaimed by the heart's inward knowledge, which is
real faith and divinity"--something much better than the learning of
divines. I need not anticipate here the question, which will be
discussed in the following chapter, how far the claims of an infallible
conscience are reconcilable with external religion and morality. The
Prophet, too, prayed that God would put a light into his ear and into
his eye; and after mentioning the different members of his body, he
concluded, "and make the whole of me one light." <span
class="small">{The reader should be reminded that most, if not all,
mystical Traditions ascribed to Mohammed were forged and fathered upon
him by the Sufis, who represent themselves as the true interpreters of
his esoteric teaching.}</span> From illumination of gradually increasing
splendour, the mystic rises to contemplation of the divine attributes,
and ultimately, when his consciousness is wholly melted away, he becomes
transubstantiated (*tajawhara*) in the radiance of the divine essence.
This is the 'station' of well-doing (*ihsan*)--for "God is with the
well-doers" ([Kor. 29.69](../pick/029.htm#029_069).md), and we have

<span id="54"><span class="small">{p. 54}</span></span>

Prophetic authority for the statement that "well-doing consists in
worshipping God as though thou wert seeing Him."

I will not waste the time and abuse the patience of my readers by
endeavouring to classify and describe these various grades of
illumination, which may be depicted symbolically but cannot be explained
in scientific language. We must allow the mystics to speak for
themselves. Granted that their teaching is often hard to understand, it
conveys more of the truth than we can ever hope to obtain from analysis
and dissection.

Here are two passages from the oldest Persian treatise on Sufism, the
*Kashf al-Mahjub* of Hujwiri:

> "It is related that Sari al-Saqati said, 'O God, whatever punishment
> thou mayst inflict upon me, do not punish me with the humiliation of
> being veiled from Thee,' because, if I am not veiled from Thee, my
> torment and affliction will be lightened by the recollection and
> contemplation of Thee; but if I am veiled from Thee, even Thy bounty
> will be deadly to me. There is no punishment in Hell more painful and
> hard to bear than that of being veiled. If God were revealed in Hell
> to the people of Hell, sinful, believers would never think of
> Paradise, since

<span id="55"><span class="small">{p. 55}</span></span>

> the sight of God would so fill them with joy that they would not feel
> bodily pain. And in Paradise there is no pleasure more perfect than
> unveiledness. If the people there enjoyed all the pleasures of that
> place and other pleasures a hundredfold, but were veiled from God,
> their hearts would be utterly broken. Therefore it is the way of God
> to let the hearts of those who love Him have vision of Him always, in
> order that the delight thereof may enable them to endure every
> tribulation; and they say in their visions, 'We deem all torments more
> desirable than to be veiled from Thee. When Thy beauty is revealed to
> our hearts, we take no thought of affliction.'"

> "There are really two kinds of contemplation. The former is the result
> of perfect faith, the latter of rapturous love, for in the rapture of
> love a man attains to such a degree that his whole being is absorbed
> in the thought of his Beloved and he sees nothing else. Muhammad ibn
> Wasi‘ said: 'I never saw anything without seeing God therein,' *i.e.*
> through perfect faith. Shibli said: 'I never saw anything except God,'
> *i.e.* in the rapture of love and the fervour of contemplation. One
> mystic

<span id="56"><span class="small">{p. 56}</span></span>

> sees the act with his bodily eye, and, as he looks, beholds the Agent
> with his spiritual eye; another is rapt by love of the Agent from all
> things else, so that he sees only the Agent. The one method is
> demonstrative, the other is ecstatic. In the former case, a manifest
> proof is derived from the evidences of God; in the latter case, the
> seer is enraptured and transported by desire: evidences are a veil to
> him, because he who knows a thing does not care for aught besides, and
> he who loves a thing does not regard aught besides, but renounces
> contention with God and interference with Him in His decrees and acts.
> When the lover turns his eye away from created things, he will
> inevitably see the Creator with his heart. God hath said, 'Tell the
> believers to close their eyes' ([Kor.
> 24.30](../pick/024.htm#024_030).md), *i.e.* to close their bodily eyes to
> lusts and their spiritual eyes to created things. He who is most
> sincere in self-mortification is most firmly grounded in
> contemplation. Sahl ibn ‘Abdallah of Tustar said: 'If any one shuts
> his eye to God for a single moment, he will never be rightly guided
> all his life long,' because to regard other than God is to be handed
> over to other than God, and one who is

<span id="57"><span class="small">{p. 57}</span></span>

> left at the mercy of other than God is lost. Therefore the life of
> contemplatives is the time during which they enjoy contemplation; time
> spent in ocular vision they do not reckon as life, for that to them is
> really death. Thus, when Bayazid was asked how old he was, he replied,
> 'Four years.' They said to him, 'How can that be?' He answered, 'I
> have been veiled from God by this world for seventy years, but I have
> seen Him during the last four years: the period in which one is veiled
> does not belong to one's life.'"

I take the following quotation from the *Mawaqif* of Niffari, an author
with whom we shall become better acquainted as we proceed:

> "God said to me, 'The least of the sciences of nearness is that you
> should see in everything the effects of beholding Me, and that this
> vision should prevail over you more than your gnosis of Me.'"

Explanation by the commentator:

> "He means that the least of the sciences of nearness (proximity to
> God) is that when you look at anything, sensibly or intellectually or
> otherwise, you should be conscious of beholding God with a vision
> clearer than your vision of that thing. There are diverse

<span id="58"><span class="small">{p. 58}</span></span>

> degrees in this matter. Some mystics say that they never see anything
> without seeing God before it. Others say, 'without seeing God after
> it,' or 'with it'; or they say that they see nothing but God. A
> certain Sufi said, 'I made the pilgrimage and saw the Ka‘ba, but not
> the Lord of the Ka‘ba.' This is the perception of one who is veiled.
> Then he said, 'I made the pilgrimage again, and I saw both the Ka‘ba
> and the Lord of the Ka‘ba.' This is contemplation of the
> Self-subsistence through which everything subsists, *i.e.* he saw the
> Ka‘ba subsisting through the Lord of the Ka‘ba. Then he said, 'I made
> the pilgrimage a third time, and I saw the Lord of the Ka‘ba, but not
> the Ka‘ba.' This is the 'station' of *waqfat* (passing-away in the
> essence). In the present case the author is referring to contemplation
> of the Self-subsistence."

So much concerning the theory of illumination. But, as Mephistopheles
says, "*grau ist alle Theorie*"; and though to most of us the living
experience is denied, we can hear its loudest echoes and feel its
warmest afterglow in the poetry which it has created. Let me translate
part of a Persian ode by the dervish-poet, Baba Kuhi of Shiriz, who died
in 1050 A.D.

<span id="59"><span class="small">{p. 59}</span></span>

\* \* \*

      "In the market, in the cloister--only God I saw.
      In the valley and on the mountain--only God I saw.
      Him I have seen beside me oft in tribulation;
      In favour and in fortune--only God I saw.
      In prayer and fasting, in praise and contemplation,
      In the religion of the Prophet--only God I saw.
      Neither soul nor body, accident nor substance,
      Qualities nor causes--only God I saw.
      I oped mine eyes and by the light of His face around me
      In all the eye discovered--only God I saw.
      Like a candle I was melting in His fire:
      Amidst the flames outflashing--only God I saw.
      Myself with mine own eyes I saw most clearly,
      But when I looked with God's eyes--only God I saw.
      I passed away into nothingness, I vanished,
      And lo, I was the All-living--only God I saw."

The whole of Sufism rests on the belief that when the individual self is
lost, the Universal Self is found, or, in religious language, that
ecstasy affords the only means by which the soul can directly
communicate and become united with God. Asceticism, purification, love,
gnosis, saintship--all the leading ideas of Sufism--are developed from
this cardinal principle.

Among the metaphorical terms commonly employed by the Sufis as, more or
less, equivalent to 'ecstasy' are *fana* (passing-away), *wajd*
(feeling), *sama‘* (hearing), *dhawq* (taste), *shirb* (drinking),
*ghaybat* (absence from self), *jadhbat* (attraction), *sukr*
(intoxication), and *hal* (emotion). It would be tedious and not, I
think, specially in-

<span id="60"><span class="small">{p. 60}</span></span>

structive to examine in detail the definitions of those terms and of
many others akin to them which occur in Sufi text-books. We are not
brought appreciably nearer to understanding the nature of ecstasy when
it is described as "a divine mystery which God communicates to true
believers who behold Him with the eye of certainty," or as "a flame
which moves in the ground of the soul and is produced by love-desire."
The Mohammedan theory of ecstasy, however can hardly be discussed
without reference to two of the above-mentioned technical expressions,
namely, *fana* and *sama‘*.

As I have remarked in the Introduction ([pp. 17-19](#17).md), the term
*fana* includes different stages, aspects, and meanings. These may be
summarised as follows:

1\. A moral transformation of the soul through the extinction of all its
passions and desires.

2\. A mental abstraction or passing-away of the mind from all objects of
perception, thoughts, actions, and feelings through its concentration
upon the thought of God. Here the thought of God signifies contemplation
of the divine attributes.

3\. The cessation of all conscious thought. The highest stage of *fana*
is reached when even the consciousness of having attained fana
disappears. This is what the Sufis call 'the passing-away of
passing-away'

<span id="61"><span class="small">{p. 61}</span></span>

(*fana al-fana*). The mystic is now rapt in contemplation of the divine
essence.

The final stage of *fana*, the complete passing-away from self, forms
the prelude to *baqa*, 'continuance' or 'abiding' in God, and will be
treated with greater fullness in Chapter VI.

The first stage closely resembles the Buddhistic Nirvana. It is a
'passing-away' of evil qualities and states of mind, which involves the
simultaneous 'continuance' of good qualities and states of mind. This is
necessarily an ecstatic process, inasmuch as all the attributes of
'self' are evil in relation to God. No one can make himself perfectly
moral, *i.e.* perfectly 'selfless.' This must be done for him, through
'a flash of the divine beauty' in his heart.

While the first stage refers to the moral 'self,' the second refers to
the percipient and intellectual 'self.' Using the classification
generally adopted by Christian mystics, we may regard the former as the
consummation of the Purgative Life, and the latter as the goal of the
Illuminative Life. The third and last stage constitutes the highest
level of the Contemplative Life.

Often, though not invariably, *fana* is accompanied by loss of
sensation. Sari al-Saqati, a famous Sufi of the third century, expressed
the opinion that if a man in this state were struck on the face with a
sword, he would not feel the blow. Abu ’l-Khayr

<span id="62"><span class="small">{p. 62}</span></span>

al-Aqta‘ had a gangrene in his foot. The physicians declared that his
foot must be amputated, but he would not allow this to be done. His
disciples said, "Cut it off while he is praying, for he is then
unconscious." The physicians acted on their advice, and when Abu
’l-Khayr finished his prayers he found that the amputation had taken
place. It is difficult to see how any one far advanced in *fana* could
be capable of keeping the religious law--a point on which the orthodox
mystics lay great emphasis. Here the doctrine of saintship comes in. God
takes care to preserve His elect from disobedience to His commands. We
are told that Bayazid, Shibli, and other saints were continually in a
state of rapture until the hour of prayer arrived; then they returned to
consciousness, and after performing their prayers became enraptured
again.

In theory, the ecstatic trance is involuntary, although certain
conditions are recognised as being specially favourable to its
occurrence. "It comes to a man through vision of the majesty of God and
through revelation of the divine omnipotence to his heart." Such, for
instance, was the case of Abu Hamza, who, while walking in the streets
of Baghdad and meditating on the nearness of God, suddenly fell into an
ecstasy and went on his way, neither seeing nor hearing, until he
recovered his senses and found himself in

<span id="63"><span class="small">{p. 63}</span></span>

the desert. Trances of this kind sometimes lasted many weeks. It is
recorded of Sahl ibn ‘Abdallah that he used to remain in ecstasy
twenty-five days at a time, eating no food; yet he would answer
questions put to him by the doctors of theology, and even in winter his
shirt would be damp with sweat. But the Sufis soon discovered that
ecstasy might be induced artificially, not only by concentration of
thought, recollection (*dhikr*), and other innocent methods of
autohypnosis, but also by music, singing, and dancing. These are
included in the term *sama‘*, which properly means nothing more than
audition.

That Moslems are extraordinarily susceptible to the sweet influences of
sound will not be doubted by any one who remembers how, in the *Arabian
Nights*, heroes and heroines alike swoon upon the slightest provocation
afforded by a singing-girl touching her lute and trilling a few lines of
passionate verse. The fiction is true to life. When Sufi writers discuss
the analogous phenomena of ecstasy, they commonly do so in a chapter
entitled 'Concerning the *Sama‘*.' Under this heading Hujwiri, in the
final chapter of his *Kashf al-Mahjub*, gives us an excellent summary of
his own and other Mohammedan theories, together with numerous anecdotes
of persons who were thrown into ecstasy on hearing a verse of the Koran
or a heavenly voice (*hatif*) or poetry

<span id="64"><span class="small">{p. 64}</span></span>

or music. Many are said to have died from the emotion thus aroused. I
may add by way of explanation that, according to a well-known mystical
belief, God has inspired every created thing to praise Him in its own
language, so that all the sounds in the universe form, as it were, one
vast choral hymn by which He glorifies Himself. Consequently those whose
hearts He has opened and endowed with spiritual perception hear His
voice everywhere, and ecstasy overcomes them as they listen to the
rhythmic chant of the muezzin, or the street cry of the saqqa
shouldering his waterskin, or, perchance, to the noise of wind or the
bleating of a sheep or the piping of a bird.

Pythagoras and Plato are responsible for another theory, to which the
Sufi poets frequently allude, that music awakens in the soul a memory of
celestial harmonies heard in a state of pre-existence, before the soul
was separated from God. Thus Jalaluddin Rumi:

      "The song of the spheres in their revolutions
      Is what men sing with lute and voice.
      As we all are members of Adam,
      We have heard these melodies in Paradise.
      Though earth and water have cast their veil upon us,
      We retain faint reminiscences of these heavenly songs;
      But while we are thus shrouded by gross earthly veils,
      How can the tones of the dancing spheres reach us?"
      {E. H. Whinfield, abridged translation of the Masnavi, p. 182.}

<span id="65"><span class="small">{p. 65}</span></span>

\* \* \*

The formal practice of *sama‘* quickly spread amongst the Sufis and
produced an acute cleavage of opinion, some holding it to be lawful and
praiseworthy, whilst others condemned it as an abominable innovation and
incitement to vice. Hujwiri adopts the middle view expressed in a saying
of Dhu ’l-Nun the Egyptian:

> "Music is a divine influence which stirs the heart to seek God: those
> who listen to it spiritually attain unto God, and those who listen to
> it sensually fall into unbelief."

He declares, in effect, that audition is neither good nor bad, and must
be judged by its results.

> "When an anchorite goes into a tavern, the tavern becomes his cell,
> but when a wine-bibber goes into a cell, that cell becomes his
> tavern."

One whose heart is absorbed in the thought of God cannot be corrupted by
hearing musical instruments. So with dancing.

> "When the heart throbs and rapture grows intense, and the agitation of
> ecstasy is manifested. and conventional forms are gone, this is not
> dancing nor bodily indulgence, but a dissolution of the soul."

Hujwiri, however, lays down several precautionary rules for those who
engage in audition, and he confesses that the public

<span id="66"><span class="small">{p. 66}</span></span>

concerts given by dervishes are extremely demoralising. Novices, he
thinks, should not be permitted to attend them. In modern times these
orgiastic scenes have frequently been described by eye-witnesses. I will
now translate from Jami's *Lives of the Saints* the account of a similar
performance which took place about seven hundred years ago.

> "There was a certain dervish, a negro called Zangi Bashgirdi, who had
> attained to such a high degree of spirituality that the mystic dance
> could not be started until he came out and joined in it. One day, in
> the course of the *sama‘*, he was seized with ecstasy, and rising into
> the air seated himself on a lofty arch which overlooked the dancers.
> In descending he leaped on to Majduddin of Baghdad, and encircled with
> his legs the neck of the Sheykh, who nevertheless continued to spin
> round in the dance, though he was a very frail and slender man,
> whereas the negro was tall and heavy. When the dance was finished,
> Majduddin said, 'I did not know whether it was a negro or a sparrow on
> my neck.' On getting off the Sheykh's shoulders, the negro bit his
> cheek so severely that the scar remained visible ever after. Majduddin
> often used to say that on the Day of Judgment he would not boast of
> any-

<span id="67"><span class="small">{p. 67}</span></span>

> thing except that he bore the mark of this negro's teeth on his face."

Grotesque and ignoble features--not to speak of grosser
deformities--must appear in any faithful delineation of the ecstatic
life of Islam. Nothing is gained by concealing their existence or by
minimising their importance. If, as Jalaluddin Rumi says:

      "Men incur the reproach of wine and drugs
      That they may escape for a while from self-consciousness,
      Since all know this life to be a snare,
      Volitional memory and thought to be a hell,"

let us acknowledge that the transports of spiritual intoxication are not
always sublime, and that human nature has a trick of avenging itself on
those who would cast it off.

## CHAPTER III

### THE GNOSIS

THE Sufis distinguish three organs of spiritual communication: the heart
(*qalb*), which knows God; the spirit (*ruh*), which loves Him; and the
inmost ground of the soul (*sirr*), which contemplates Him. It would
take us into deep waters if we were to embark upon a discussion of these
terms and their relation to each other. A few words concerning the first
of the three will suffice. The *qalb*, though connected in some
mysterious way with the physical heart, is not a thing of flesh and
blood. Unlike the English 'heart,' its nature is rather intellectual
than emotional, but whereas the intellect cannot gain real knowledge of
God, the *qalb* is capable of knowing the essences of all things, and
when illumined by faith and knowledge reflects the whole content of the
divine mind; hence the Prophet said, "My earth and My heaven contain Me
not, but the heart of My faithful servant containeth Me." This
revelation, however, is a comparatively rare experience.

<span id="69"><span class="small">{p. 69}</span></span>

Normally, the heart is 'veiled,' blackened by sin, tarnished by sensual
impressions and images, pulled to and fro between reason and passion: a
battlefield on which the armies of God and the Devil contend for
victory. Through one gate, the heart receives immediate knowledge of
God; through another, it lets in the illusions of sense. "Here a world
and there a world," says Jalaluddin Rumi. "I am seated on the
threshold." Therefore man is potentially lower than the brutes and
higher than the angels.

      "Angel and brute man's wondrous leaven compose;
      To these inclining, less than these he grows,
      But if he means the angel, more than those."

Less than the brutes, because they lack the knowledge that would enable
them to rise; more than the angels, because they are not subject to
passion and so cannot fall.

How shall a man know God? Not by the senses, for He is immaterial; nor
by the intecllect, for He is unthinkable. Logic never gets beyond the
finite; philosophy sees double; book-learning fosters self-conceit and
obscures the idea of the Truth with clouds of empty words. Jalaluddin
Rumi, addressing the scholastic theologian, asks scornfully:

      "Do you know a name without a thing answering to it?
      Have you ever plucked a rose from R, O, S, E?
      You name His name; go, seek the reality named by it!

<span id="70"><span class="small">{p. 70}</span></span>

      Look for the moon in the sky, not in the water!
      If you desire to rise above mere names and letters,
      Make yourself free from self at one stroke.
      Become pure from all attributes of self,
      That you may see your own bright essence,
      Yea, see in your own heart the knowledge of the Prophet,
      Without book, without tutor, without preceptor."

This knowledge comes by illumination, revelation, inspiration.

"Look in your own heart," says the Sufi, "for the kingdom of God is
within you." He who truly knows himself knows God, for the heart is a
mirror in which every divine quality is reflected. But just as a steel
mirror when coated with rust loses its power of reflexion, so the inward
spiritual sense, which Sufis call the eye of the heart, is blind to the
celestial glory until the dark obstruction of the phenomenal self, with
all its sensual contaminations, has been wholly cleared away. The
clearance, if it is to be done effectively, must be the work of God,
though it demands a certain inward co-operation on the part of man.
"Whosoever shall strive for Our sake, We will guide him into Our ways"
([Kor. 29.69](../pick/029.htm#029_069).md). Action is false and vain, if it
is thought to proceed from one's self, but the enlightened mystic
regards God as the real agent in every act, and therefore takes no
credit for his good works nor desires to be recompensed for them.

\* \* \*

While ordinary knowledge is denoted by the term *‘ilm*, the mystic
knowledge peculiar to the Sufis is called *ma‘rifat* or *‘irfan*. As I
have indicated in the foregoing paragraphs, *ma‘rifat* is fundamentally
different from *‘irfan*, and a different word must be used to translate
it. We need not look far for a suitable equivalent. The *ma‘rifat* of
the Sufis is the 'gnosis' of Hellenistic theosophy, *i.e.* direct
knowledge of God based on revelation or apocalyptic vision. It is not
the result of any mental process, but depends entirely on the will and
favour of God, who bestows it as a gift from Himself upon those whom He
has created with the capacity for receiving it. It is a light of divine
grace that flashes into the heart and overwhelms every human faculty in
its dazzling beams. "He who knows God is dumb."

The relation of gnosis to positive religion is discussed in a very
remarkable treatise on speculative mysticism by Niffari, an unknown
wandering dervish who died in Egypt in the latter half of the tenth
century. His work, consisting of a series of revelations in which God
addresses the writer and instructs him concerning the theory of gnosis,
is couched in abstruse language and would scarcely be intelligible
without the commentary which accompanies it; but its value as an
original exposition of advanced

<span id="72"><span class="small">{p. 72}</span></span>

Sufism will sufficiently appear from the excerpts given in this chapter.
<span class="small">{I am now engaged in preparing an edition of the
Arabic text, together with an English translation and
commentary.}</span>

Those who seek God, says Niffari, are of three kinds: *firstly*, the
worshippers to whom God makes Himself known by means of bounty, *i.e.*
they worship Him in the hope of winning Paradise or some spiritual
recompense such as dreams and miracles; *secondly*, the philosophers and
scholastic theologians, to whom God makes Himself known by means of
glory, *i.e.* they can never find the glorious God whom they seek,
wherefore they assert that His essence is unknowable, saying, "We know
that we know Him not, and that is our knowledge"; *thirdly*, the
gnostics, to whom God makes Himself known by means of ecstasy, *i.e.*
they are possessed and controlled by a rapture that deprives them of the
consciousness of individual existence.

Niffari bids the gnostic perform only such acts of worship as are in
accordance with his vision of God, though in so doing he will
necessarily disobey the religious law which was made for the vulgar. His
inward feeling must decide how far the external forms of religion are
good for him.

> "God said to me, Ask Me and say, 'O Lord, how shall I cleave to Thee,
> so that when my day (of judgment)

<span id="73"><span class="small">{p. 73}</span></span>

> comes, Thou wilt not punish me nor avert Thy face from me?' Then I
> will answer thee and say, 'Cleave in thy outward theory and practice
> to the Sunna (the rule of the Prophet), and cleave in thy inward
> feeling to the gnosis which I have given thee; and know that when I
> make Myself known to thee, I will not accept from thee anything of the
> Sunna but what My gnosis brings to thee, because thou art one of those
> to whom I speak: thou hearest Me and knowest that thou hearest Me, and
> thou seest that I am the source of all things.'"

The commentator observes that the Sunna, being general in scope, makes
no distinction between individuals, *e.g.* seekers of Paradise and
seekers of God, but that in reality it contains exactly what each person
requires. The portion specially appropriate in every case is discerned
either by means of gnosis, which God communicates to the heart, or by
means of guidance imparted by a spiritual director.

> "And He said to me, 'My exoteric revelation does not support My
> esoteric revelation.'"

This means that the gnostic need not be dismayed if his inner experience
conflicts with the religious law. The contradiction is only apparent.
Religion addresses itself

<span id="74"><span class="small">{p. 74}</span></span>

to the common herd of men who are veiled by their minds, by logic,
tradition, and so on; whereas gnosis belongs to the elect, whose bodies
and spirits are bathed in the eternal Light. Religion sees things from
the aspect of plurality, but gnosis regards the all-embracing Unity.
Hence the same act is good in religion, but evil in gnosis--a truth
which is briefly stated thus:

> "The good deeds of the pious are the ill deeds of the favourites of
> God."

Although works of devotion are not incompatible with gnosis, no one who
connects them in the slightest degree with himself is a gnostic. This is
the theme of the following allegory. Niffari seldom writes so lucidly as
he does here, yet I fancy that few of my readers will find the
explanations printed within square brackets altogether superfluous.

THE REVELATION OF THE SEA

> "God bade me behold the Sea, and I saw the ships sinking and the

> "And He said to me, 'Those who instead of voyaging cast themselves

<span id="76"><span class="small">{p. 76}</span></span>

\* \* \*

> "And the wave came and lifted those beneath it and overran the shore."

The gnostic descries the element of reality in positive religion, but
his gnosis is not

<span id="79"><span class="small">{p. 79}</span></span>

derived from religion or from any sort of human knowledge: it is
properly concerned with the divine attributes, and God Himself reveals
the knowledge of these to His saints who contemplate Him. Dhu ’l-Nun of
Egypt, whose mystical speculations mark him out as the father of Moslem
theosophy, said that gnostics are not themselves, and do not subsist
through themselves, but so far as they subsist, they subsist through
God.

> "They move as God causes them to move, and their words are the words
> of God which roll upon their tongues, and their sight is the sight of
> God which has entered their eyes."

The gnostic contemplates the attributes of God, not His essence, for
even in gnosis a small trace of duality remains: this disappears only in
*fana al-fana*, the total passing-away in the undifferentiated Godhead.
The cardinal attribute of God is unity, and the divine unity is the
first and last principle of gnosis. <span class="small">{According to
some mystics, the gnosis of unity constitutes a higher stage which is
called 'the Truth' (*haqiqat*). See above, [p. 29](#29.md).}</span>

Both Moslem and Sufi declare that God is One, but the statement bears a
different meaning in each instance. The Moslem means that God is unique
in His essence, qualities, and acts; that He is absolutely unlike all
other beings. The Sufi means

<span id="80"><span class="small">{p. 80}</span></span>

that God is the One Real Being which underlies all phenomena. This
principle is carried to its extreme consequences, as we shall see. If
nothing except God exists, then the whole universe, including man, is
essentially one with God, whether it is regarded as an emanation which
proceeds from Him, without impairing His unity, like sunbeams from the
sun, or whether it is conceived as a mirror in which the divine
attributes are reflected. But surely a God who is all in all can have no
reason for thus revealing Himself: why should the One pass over into the
Many? The Sufis answer--a philosopher would say that they evade the
difficulty--by quoting the famous Tradition: "I was a hidden treasure
and I desired to be known; therefore I created the creation in order
that I might be known." In other words, God is the eternal Beauty, and
it lies in the nature of beauty to desire love. The mystic poets have
described the self-manifestation of the One with a profusion of splendid
imagery. Jami says, for example:

      "From all eternity the Beloved unveiled His beauty in the solitude
        of the unseen;
      He held up the mirror to His own face, He displayed His loveliness
        to Himself.
      He was both the spectator and the spectacle; no eye but His had
        surveyed the Universe.
      All was One, there was no duality, no pretence of 'mine' or 'thine.'

<span id="81"><span class="small">{p. 81}</span></span>

      The vast orb of Heaven, with its myriad incomings and outgoings,
        was concealed in a single point.
      The Creation lay cradled in the sleep of non-existence, like a child
        ere it has breathed.
      The eye of the Beloved, seeing what was not, regarded nonentity as
        existent.
      Although He beheld His attributes and qualities as a perfect whole
        in His own essence,
      Yet He desired that they should be displayed to Him in another mirror,
      And that each one of His eternal attributes should become manifest
        accordingly in a diverse form,
      Therefore He created the verdant fields of Time and Space and the
        life-giving garden of the world,
      That every branch and leaf and fruit might show forth His various
        perfections,
      The cypress gave a hint of His comely stature, the rose gave tidings
        of His beauteous countenance.
      Wherever Beauty peeped out, Love appeared beside it; wherever Beauty
        shone in a rosy cheek, Love lit his torch from that flame.
      Wherever Beauty dwelt in dark tresses, Love came and found a heart
        entangled in their coils.
      Beauty and Love are as body and soul; Beauty is the mine and Love
        the precious stone.
      They have always been together from the very first; never have they
        travelled but in each other's company."

In another work Jami sets forth the relation of God to the world more
philosophically, as follows:

> "The unique Substance, viewed as absolute and void of all phenomena,
> all limitations and all multiplicity, is the Real (*al-Haqq*). On the
> other hand, viewed in His aspect of multiplicity and

<span id="82"><span class="small">{p. 82}</span></span>

> plurality, under which He displays Himself when clothed with
> phenomena, He is the whole created universe. Therefore the universe is
> the outward visible expression of the Real, and the Real is the inner
> unseen reality of the universe. The universe before it was evolved to
> outward view was identical with the Real; and the Real after this
> evolution is identical with the universe."

Phenomena, as such, are not-being and only derive a contingent existence
from the qualities of Absolute Being by which they are irradiated. The
sensible world resembles the fiery circle made by a single spark
whirling round rapidly.

Man is the crown and final cause of the universe. Though last in the
order of creation he is first in the process of divine thought, for the
essential part of him is the primal Intelligence or universal Reason
which emanates immediately from the Godhead. This corresponds to the
Logos--the animating principle of all things--and is identified with the
Prophet Mohammed. An interesting parallel might be drawn here between
the Christian and Sufi doctrines. The same expressions are applied to
the founder of Islam which are used by St. John, St. Paul, and later
mystical theologians concerning Christ. Thus, Mohammed is called the
Light of God, he is said to have

<span id="83"><span class="small">{p. 83}</span></span>

existed before the creation of the world, he is adored as the source of
all life, actual and possible, he is the Perfect Man in whom all the
divine attributes are manifested, and a Sufi tradition ascribes to him
the saying, "He that hath seen me hath seen Allah." In the Moslem
scheme, however, the Logos doctrine occupies a subordinate place, as it
obviously must when the whole duty of man is believed to consist in
realising the unity of God. The most distinctive feature of Oriental as
opposed to European mysticism is its profound consciousness of an
omnipresent, all-pervading unity in which every vestige of individuality
is swallowed up. Not to become *like* God or *personally* to participate
in the divine nature is the Sufi's aim, but to escape from the bondage
of his unreal selfhood and thereby to be reunited with the One infinite
Being.

According to Jami, Unification consists in making the heart single--that
is, in purifying and divesting it of attachment to aught except God,
both in respect of desire and will and also as regards knowledge and
gnosis. The mystic's desire and will should be severed from all things
which are desired and willed; all objects of knowledge and understanding
should be removed from his intellectual vision. His thoughts should be
directed solely towards God, he should not be conscious of anything
besides.

<span id="84"><span class="small">{p. 84}</span></span>

\* \* \*

So long as he is a captive in the snare of passion and lust, it is hard
for him to maintain this relation to God, but when the subtle influence
of that attraction becomes manifest in him, expelling preoccupation with
objects of sense and cognition from his inward being, delight in that
divine communion prevails over bodily pleasures and spiritual joys; the
painful task of self-mortification is ended, and the sweetness of
contemplation enravishes his soul.

When the sincere aspirant perceives in himself the beginning of this
attraction, which is delight in the recollection of God, let him fix his
whole mind on fostering and strengthening it, let him keep himself aloof
from whatsoever is incompatible with it, and deem that even though he
were to devote an eternity to cultivating that communion, he would have
done nothing and would not have discharged his duty as he ought.

      "Love thrilled the chord of love in my soul's lute,
      And changed me all to love from head to foot.
      'Twas but a moment's touch, yet shall Time ever
      To me the debt of thanksgiving impute."

It is an axiom of the Sufis that what is not *in* a man he cannot know.
The gnostic--Man *par excellence*--could not know God and all the
mysteries of the universe, unless he found them in himself. He is the
micro-

<span id="85"><span class="small">{p. 85}</span></span>

cosm, 'a copy made in the image of God,' 'the eye of the world whereby
God sees His own works.' In knowing himself as he really is, he knows
God, and he knows himself through God, who is nearer to everything than
its knowledge of itself. Knowledge of God precedes, and is the cause of,
self-knowledge.

Gnosis, then, is unification, realisation of the fact that the
appearance of 'otherness' beside Oneness is a false and deluding dream.
Gnosis lays this spectre, which haunts unenlightened men all their
lives; which rises, like a wall of utter darkness, between them and God.
Gnosis proclaims that 'I' is a figure of speech, and that one cannot
truly refer any will, feeling, thought, or action to one's self.

Niffari heard the divine voice saying to him:

> "When thou regardest thyself as existent and dost not regard Me as the
> Cause of thy existence, I veil My face and thine own face appears to
> thee. Therefore consider what is displayed to thee, and what is hidden
> from thee!"

> \[If a man regards himself as existing through God, that which is of
> God in him predominates over the phenomenal element and makes it pass
> away, so that he sees nothing but God. If, on the

<span id="86"><span class="small">{p. 86}</span></span>

> contrary, he regards himself as having an independent existence, his
> unreal egoism is displayed to him and the reality of God becomes
> hidden from him.\]

> "Regard neither My displaying nor that which is displayed, else thou
> wilt laugh and weep; and when thou laughest and weepest, thou art
> thine, not Mine."

> \[He who regards the act of divine revelation is guilty of polytheism,
> since revelation involves both a revealing subject and a revealed
> object; and he who regards the revealed object which is part of the
> created universe, regards something other than God. Laughter signifies
> joy for what you have gained, and weeping denotes grief for what you
> have lost. Both are selfish actions. The gnostic neither laughs nor
> weeps.\]

> "If thou dost not put behind thee all that I have displayed and am
> displaying, thou wilt not prosper; and unless thou prosper, thou wilt
> not become concentrated upon Me."

> \[Prosperity is true belief in God, which requires complete
> abstraction from created things.\]

Logically, these doctrines annul every moral and religious law. In the
gnostic's vision there are no divine rewards and punishments, no human
standards of right

<span id="87"><span class="small">{p. 87}</span></span>

and wrong. For him, the written word of God has been abrogated by a
direct and intimate revelation.

> "I do not say," exclaimed Abu ’l-Hasan Khurqani, "that Paradise and
> Hell are non-existent, but I say that they are nothing to me, because
> God created them both, and there is no room for any created object in
> the place where I am."

From this standpoint all types of religion are equal, and Islam is no
better than idolatry. It does not matter what creed a man professes or
what rites he performs.

      "The true mosque in a pure and holy heart
      Is builded: there let all men worship God;
      For there He dwells, not in a mosque of stone."

Amidst all the variety of creeds and worshippers the gnostic sees but
one real object of worship.

> "Those who adore God in the sun" (says Ibn al-‘Arabi) "behold the sun,
> and those who adore Him in living things see a living thing, and those
> who adore Him in lifeless things see a lifeless thing, and those who
> adore Him as a Being unique and unparalleled see that which has no
> like. Do not attach yourself" (he continues) "to any particular creed
> exclusively, so that you disbelieve in all the rest; otherwise,

<span id="88"><span class="small">{p. 88}</span></span>

> you will lose much good, nay, you will fail to recognise the real

> limited by any one creed, for He says ([Kor.
> 2.109](../pick/002.htm#002_115).md), 'Wheresoever ye turn, there is the

> but his dislike is based on ignorance. If he knew Junayd's saying,
> 'The water takes its colour from the vessel containing it,' he would
> not interfere with other men's beliefs, but would perceive God in
> every form of belief."

And Hafiz sings, more in the spirit of the freethinker, perhaps, than of
the mystic:

      "Love is where the g1ory falls
      Of Thy face--on convent walls
      Or on tavern floors, the same
      Unextinguishable flame.

      Where the turbaned anchorite
      Chanteth Allah day and night,
      Church bells ring the call to prayer
      And the Cross of Christ is there."

Sufism may join hands with freethought--it has often done so--but hardly
ever with sectarianism. This explains why the vast

<span id="89"><span class="small">{p. 89}</span></span>

majority of Sufis have been, at least nominally, attached to the
catholic body of the Moslem community. ‘Abdallah Ansari declared that of
two thousand Sufi Sheykhs with whom he was acquainted only two were
Shi‘ites. A certain man who was a descendant of the Caliph ‘Ali, and a
fanatical Shi‘ite, tells the following story:

> "For five years," he said, "my father sent me daily to a spiritual
> director. I learned one useful lesson from him: he told me that I
> should never know anything at all about Sufism until I got completely
> rid of the pride which I felt on account of my lineage."

Superficial observers have described Babism as an offshoot of Sufism,
but the dogmatism of the one is naturally opposed to the broad
eclecticism of the other. In proportion as the Sufi gains more knowledge
of God, his religious prejudices are diminished. Sheykh ‘Abd al-Rahim
ibn al-Sabbagh, who at first disliked living in Upper Egypt, with its
large Jewish and Christian population, said in his old age that he would
as readily embrace a Jew or Christian as one of his own faith.

While the innumerable forms of creed and ritual may be regarded as
having a certain relative value in so far as the inward feeling which
inspires them is ever one and the same, from another aspect they seem to
be veils of the Truth, barriers which the zealous

<span id="90"><span class="small">{p. 90}</span></span>

Unitarian must strive to abolish and destroy.

      "This world and that world are the egg, and the bird within it
      Is in darkness and broken-winged and scorned and despised.
      Regard unbelief and faith as the white and the yolk in this egg,
      Between them, joining and dividing, a barrier which they shall
        not pass.
      When He hath graciously fostered the egg under His wing,
      Infidelity and religion disappear: the bird of Unity spreads its
        pinions."

The great Persian mystic, Abu Sa‘id ibn Abi ’l-Khayr, speaking in the
name of the Calendars or wandering dervishes, expresses their
iconoclastic principles with astonishing boldness:

      "Not until every mosque beneath the sun
      Lies ruined, will our holy work be done;
      And never will true Musalman appear
      Till faith and infidelity are one."

Such open declarations of war against the Mohammedan religion are
exceptional. Notwithstanding the breadth and depth of the gulf between
full-blown Sufism and orthodox Islam, many, if not most, Sufis have paid
homage to the Prophet and have observed the outward forms of devotion
which are incumbent on all Moslems. They have invested these rites and
ceremonies with a new meaning; they have allegorised them,

<span id="91"><span class="small">{p. 91}</span></span>

but they have not abandoned them. Take the pilgrimage, for example. In
the eyes of the genuine Sufi it is null and void unless each of the
successive religious acts which it involves is accompanied by
corresponding 'movements of the heart.'

A man who had just returned from the pilgrimage came to Junayd. Junayd
said:

> "From the hour when you first journeyed from your home have you also
> been journeying away from all sins?" He said "No." "Then," said
> Junayd, "you have made no journey. At every stage where you halted for
> the night did you traverse a station on the way to God?" " No," he
> replied. "Then," said Junayd, "you have not trodden the road, stage by
> stage. When you put on the pilgrim's garb at the proper place, did you
> discard the qualities of human nature as you cast off your clothes?"
> "No." "Then you have not put on the pilgrim's garb. When you stood at
> ‘Arafat, did you stand one moment in contemplation of God?" "No."
> "Then you have not stood at ‘Arafat. When you went to Muzdalifa and
> achieved your desire, did you renounce all sensual desires?" "No."
> "Then you have not gone to Muzdalifa. When you circumambulated the
> Ka‘ba, did you behold the immaterial beauty of God

<span id="92"><span class="small">{p. 92}</span></span>

> in the abode of purification?" "No." "Then you have not
> circumambulated the Ka‘ba. When you ran between Safa and Marwa, did
> you attain to purity (*safa*) and virtue (*muruwwat*)?" "No." "Then
> you have not run. When you came to Mina, did all your wishes (*muna*)
> cease?" "No." "Then you have not yet visited Mina. When you reached
> the slaughter-place and offered sacrifice, did you sacrifice the
> objects of worldly desire?" "No." "Then you have not sacrificed. When
> you threw the pebbles, did you throw away whatever sensual thoughts
> were accompanying you?" "No." "Then you have not yet thrown the
> pebbles, and you have not yet performed the pilgrimage."

This anecdote contrasts the outer religious law of theology with the
inner spiritual truth of mysticism, and shows that they should not be
divorced from each other.

Middle ways, though proverbially safe, are difficult to walk in; and
only by a *tour de force* can the Koran be brought into line with the
esoteric doctrine which the Sufis derive from it. Undoubtedly they have
done a great work for Islam. They have deepened and enriched the lives
of millions by ruthlessly stripping off the husk of religion and
insisting that its kernel must be sought, not in any formal act, but in
cultivation of spiritual feelings and in purification of the inward man.
This was a legitimate and most fruitful development of the Prophet's
teaching. But the Prophet was a strict monotheist, while the Sufis,
whatever they may pretend or imagine, are theosophists, pantheists, or
monists. When they speak and write as believers in the dogmas of
positive religion, they use language which cannot be reconciled with
such a theory of unity as we are now examining. ‘Afifuddin al-Tilimsani,
from whose commentary on Niffari I have given some extracts in this
chapter, said roundly that the whole Koran is polytheism--a perfectly
just statement from the monistic point of view, though few Sufis have
dared to be so explicit.

<span id="94"><span class="small">{p. 94}</span></span>

\* \* \*

The mystic Unitarians admit the appearance of contradiction, but deny
its reality. "The Law and the Truth" (they might say) "are the same
thing in different aspects. The Law is for you, the Truth for us. In
addressing you we speak according to the measure of your understanding,
since what is meat for gnostics is poison to the uninitiated, and the
highest mysteries ought to be jealously guarded from profane ears. It is
only human reason that sees the single as double, and balances the Law
against the Truth. Pass away from the world of opposites and become one
with God, who has no opposite."

The gnostic recognises that the Law is valid and necessary in the moral
sphere. While good and evil remain, the Law stands over both, commanding
and forbidding, rewarding and punishing. He knows, on the other hand,
that only God really exists and acts: therefore, if evil really exists,
it must be divine, and if evil things are really done, God must be the
doer of them. The conclusion is false because the hypothesis is false.
Evil has no real existence; it is not-being, which is the privation and
absence of being, just as darkness is the absence of light. "Once," said
Nuri, "I beheld the Light, and I fixed my gaze upon it until I became
the Light." No wonder that such illuminated souls, supremely indifferent
to

<span id="95"><span class="small">{p. 95}</span></span>

the shadow-shows of religion and morality in a phantom world, are ready
to cry with Jalaluddin:

      "The man of God is made wise by the Truth,
      The man of God is not learned from book.
      The man of God is beyond infidelity and faith,
      To the man of God right and wrong are alike."

It must be borne in mind that this is a theory of perfection, and that
those whom it exalts above the Law are saints, spiritual guides, and
profound theosophists who enjoy the special favour of God and presumably
do not need to be restrained, coerced, or punished. In practice, of
course, it leads in many instances to antinomianism and libertinism, as
among the Bektashis and other orders of the so-called 'lawless'
dervishes. The same theories produced the same results in Europe during
the Middle Ages, and the impartial historian cannot ignore the
corruptions to which a purely subjective mysticism is liable; but on the
present occasion we are concerned with the rose itself, not with its
cankers.

Not all Sufis are gnostics; and, as I have mentioned before, those who
are not yet ripe for the gnosis receive from their gnostic teachers the
ethical instruction suitable to their needs. Jalaluddin Rumi, in his
collection of lyrical poems entitled *The Divan*

<span id="96"><span class="small">{p. 96}</span></span>

*of Shamsi Tabriz*, gives free rein to a pantheistic enthusiasm which
sees all things under the form of eternity.

      "I have put duality away, I have seen that the two worlds are one;
      One I seek, One I know, One I see, One I call.
      I am intoxicated with Love's cup, the two worlds have passed out
        of my ken;
      I have no business save carouse and revelry."

But in his *Masnavi*--a work so famous and venerated that it has been
styled 'The Koran of Persia'--we find him in a more sober mood
expounding the Sufi doctrines and justifying the ways of God to man.
Here, though he is a convinced optimist and agrees with Ghazali that
this is the best of all possible worlds, he does not airily dismiss the
problem of evil as something outside reality, but endeavours to show
that evil, or what seems evil to us, is part of the divine order and
harmony, I will quote some passages of his argument and leave my readers
to judge how far it is successful or, at any rate, suggestive.

The Sufis, it will be remembered, conceive the universe as a projected
and reflected image of God. The divine light, streaming forth in a
series of emanations, falls at last upon the darkness of not-being,
every atom of which reflects some attribute of Deity. For instance, the
beautiful attributes of love and mercy are reflected in the form of
heaven and the

<span id="97"><span class="small">{p. 97}</span></span>

angels, while the terrible attributes of wrath and vengeance are
reflected in the form of hell and the devils. Man reflects all the
attributes, the terrible as well as the beautiful: he is an epitome of
heaven and hell. Omar Khayyam alludes to this theory when he says:

      "Hell is a spark from our fruitless pain,
      Heaven a breath from our time of joy"

--a couplet which Fitz Gerald moulded into the magnificent stanza:

      "Heav'n but the Vision of fulfilled Desire,
      And Hell the Shadow from a Soul on fire,
        Cast on the Darkness into which Ourselves
      So late emerged from, shall so soon expire."

Jalaluddin, therefore, does in a sense make God the author of evil, but
at the same time he makes evil intrinsically good in relation to
God--for it is the reflexion of certain divine attributes which in
themselves are absolutely good. So far as evil is really evil, it
springs from not-being. The poet assigns a different value to this term
in its relation to God and in its relation to man. In respect of God
not-being is nothing, for God is real Being, but in man it is the
principle of evil which constitutes half of human nature. In the one
case it is a pure negation, in the other it is positively and actively
pernicious. We need not quarrel with the poet for

<span id="98"><span class="small">{p. 98}</span></span>

coming to grief in his logic. There are some occasions when intense
moral feeling is worth any amount of accurate thinking.

It is evident that the doctrine of divine unity implies predestination.
Where God is and naught beside Him, there can be no other agent than He,
no act but His. "Thou didst not throw, when thou threwest, but God
threw" ([Kor. 8.17](../pick/008.htm#008_017).md). Compulsion is felt only
by those who do not love. To know God is to love Him; and the gnostic
may answer, like the dervish who was asked how he fared:

      "I fare as one by whose majestic will
      The world revolves, floods rise and rivers flow,
      Stars in their courses move; yea, death and life
      Hang on his nod and fly to the ends of earth,
      His ministers of mourning or of joy."

This is the Truth; but for the benefit of such as cannot bear it,
Jalaluddin vindicates the justice of God by asserting that men have the
power to choose how they will act, although their freedom is subordinate
to the divine will. Approaching the question, "Why does God ordain and
create evil?" he points out that things are known through their
opposites, and that the existence of evil is necessary for the
manifestation of good.

      "Not-being and defect, wherever seen,
      Are mirrors of the beauty of all that is.
      The bone-setter, where should he try his skill

<span id="99"><span class="small">{p. 99}</span></span>

      But on the patient lying with broken leg?
      Were no base copper in the crucible,
      How could the alchemist his craft display?"

Moreover, the divine omnipotence would not be completely realised if
evil had remained uncreated.

      "He is the source of evil, as thou sayest,
      Yet evil hurts Him not. To make that evil
      Denotes in Him perfection. Hear from me
      A parable. The heavenly Artist paints
      Beautiful shapes and ugly: in one picture
      The loveliest women in the land of Egypt
      Gazing on youthful Joseph amorously;
      And lo, another scene by the same hand,
      Hell-fire and Iblis with his hideous crew:
      Both master-works, created for good ends,
      To show His perfect wisdom and confound
      The sceptics who deny His mastery.
      Could He not evil make, He would lack skill;
      Therefore He fashions infidel alike
      And Moslem true, that both may witness bear
      To Him, and worship One Almighty Lord."

In reply to the objection that a God who creates evil must Himself be
evil, Jalaluddin, pursuing the analogy drawn from Art, remarks that
ugliness in the picture is no evidence of ugliness in the painter.

Again, without evil it would be impossible to win the proved virtue
which is the reward of self-conquest. Bread must be broken before it can
serve as food, and grapes will not yield wine till they are crushed.
Many men are led through tribulation to happiness.

<span id="100"><span class="small">{p. 100}</span></span>

As evil ebbs, good flows. Finally, much evil is only apparent. What
seems a curse to one may be a blessing to another; nay, evil itself is
turned to good for the righteous. Jalaluddin will not admit that
anything is absolutely bad.

      "Fools buy false coins because they are like the true.
      If in the world no genuine minted coin
      Were current, how would forgers pass the false?
      Falsehood were nothing unless truth were there,
      To make it specious. 'Tis the love of right
      Lures men to wrong. Let poison but be mixed
      With sugar, they will cram it into their mouths.
      Oh, cry not that all creeds are vain! Some scent
      Of truth they have, else they would not beguile.
      Say not, 'How utterly fantastical!'
      No fancy in the world is all untrue.
      Amongst the crowd of dervishes hides one,
      One true fakir. Search well and thou wilt find!"

Surely this is a noteworthy doctrine. Jalaluddin died only a few years
after the birth of Dante, but the Christian poet falls far below the
level of charity and tolerance reached by his Moslem contemporary.

How is it possible to discern the soul of goodness in things evil? By
means of love, says Jalaluddin, and the knowledge which love alone can
give, according to the word of God in the holy Tradition:

> "My servant draws nigh unto Me, and I love him; and when I love him, I
> am his ear, so that he hears by Me, and his eye, so that he sees by
> Me, and his

<span id="101"><span class="small">{p. 101}</span></span>

> tongue, so that he speaks by Me, and his hand, so that he takes by
> Me."

Although it will be convenient to treat of mystical love in a separate
chapter, the reader must not fancy that a new subject is opening before
him. Gnosis and love are spiritually identical; they teach the same
truths in different language.

## CHAPTER IV

### DIVINE LOVE

ANY one acquainted, however slightly, with the mystical poetry of Islam
must have remarked that the aspiration of the soul towards God is
expressed, as a rule, in almost the same terms which might be used by an
Oriental Anacreon or Herrick. The resemblance, indeed, is often so close
that, unless we have some clue to the poet's intention, we are left in
doubt as to his meaning. In some cases, perhaps, the ambiguity serves an
artistic purpose, as in the odes of Hafiz, but even when the poet is not
deliberately keeping his readers suspended between earth and heaven, it
is quite easy to mistake a mystical hymn for a drinking-song or a
serenade. Ibn al-‘Arabi, the greatest theosophist whom the Arabs have
produced, found himself obliged to write a commentary on some of his
poems in order to refute the scandalous charge that they were designed
to celebrate the charms of his mistress. Here are a few lines:

      "Oh, her beauty--the tender maid! Its brilliance gives light like
        lamps to one travelling in the dark.

<span id="103"><span class="small">{p. 103}</span></span>

      She is a pearl hidden in a shell of hair as black as jet,
      A pearl for which Thought dives and remains unceasingly in the deeps
        of that ocean.
      He who looks upon her deems her to be a gazelle of the sand-hills,
        because of her shapely neck and the loveliness of her gestures."

It has been said that the Sufis invented this figurative style as a mask
for mysteries which they desired to keep secret. That desire was natural
in those who proudly claimed to possess an esoteric doctrine known only
to themselves; moreover, a plain statement of what they believed might
have endangered their liberties, if not their lives. But, apart from any
such motives, the Sufis adopt the symbolic style because there is no
other possible way of interpreting mystical experience. So little does
knowledge of the infinite revealed in ecstatic vision need an artificial
disguise that it cannot be communicated at all except through types and
emblems drawn from the sensible world, which, imperfect as they are, may
suggest and shadow forth a deeper meaning than appears on the surface.
"Gnostics," says Ibn al-‘Arabi, "cannot impart their feelings to other
men; they can only indicate them symbolically to those who have begun to
experience the like." What kind of symbolism each mystic will prefer
depends on his temperament and character. If he be a

<span id="104"><span class="small">{p. 104}</span></span>

religious artist, a spiritual poet, his ideas of reality are likely to
clothe themselves instinctively in forms of beauty and glowing images of
human love. To him the rosy cheek of the beloved represents the divine
essence manifested through its attributes; her dark curls signify the
One veiled by the Many; when he says, "Drink wine that it may set you
free from yourself," he means, "Lose your phenomenal self in the rapture
of divine contemplation." I might fill pages with further examples.

This erotic and bacchanalian symbolism is not, of course, peculiar to
the mystical poetry of Islam, but nowhere else is it displayed so
opulently and in such perfection. It has often been misunderstood by
European critics, one of whom even now can describe the ecstasies of the
Sufis as "inspired partly by wine and strongly tinged with sensuality."
As regards the whole body of Sufis, the charge is altogether false. No
intelligent and unprejudiced student of their writings could have made
it, and we ought to have been informed on what sort of evidence it is
based. There are black sheep in every flock, and amongst the Sufis we
find many hypocrites, debauchees, and drunkards who bring discredit on
the pure brethren. But it is just as unfair to judge Sufism in general
by the excesses of these impostors as it would be to condemn all

<span id="105"><span class="small">{p. 105}</span></span>

Christian mysticism on the ground that certain sects and individuals are
immoral.

      "God is the Saqi {Cupbearer} and the Wine:
      He knows what manner of love is mine,"

said Jalaluddin. Ibn al-‘Arabi declares that no religion is more sublime
than a religion of love and longing for God. Love is the essence of all
creeds: the true mystic welcomes it whatever guise it may assume.

      "My heart has become capable of every form: it is a pasture for
        gazelles and a convent for Christian monks,
      And a temple for idols, and the pilgrim's Ka‘ba, and the tables
        of the Tora and the book of the Koran.
      I follow the religion of Love, whichever way his camels take.
        My religion and my faith is the true religion.
      We have a pattern in Bishr, the lover of Hind and her sister,
        and in Qays and Lubna, and in Mayya and Ghaylan."

Commenting on the last verse, the poet writes:

> "Love, *quâ* love, is one and the same reality to those Arab lovers
> and to me; but the objects of our love are different, for they loved a
> phenomenon, whereas I love the Real. They are a pattern to us, because
> God only afflicted them with love for human beings in order that He
> might show, by means of them, the

<span id="106"><span class="small">{p. 106}</span></span>

> falseness of those who pretend to love Him, and yet feel no such
> transport and rapture in loving Him as deprived those enamoured men of
> their reason, and made them unconscious of themselves."

Most of the great medieval Sufis lived saintly lives, dreaming of God,
intoxicated with God. When they tried to tell their dreams, being men,
they used the language of men. If they were also literary artists, they
naturally wrote in the style of their own day and generation. In
mystical poetry the Arabs yield the palm to the Persians. Any one who
would read the secret of Sufism, no longer encumbered with theological
articles nor obscured by metaphysical subtleties--let him turn to
‘Attar, Jalaluddin Rumi, and Jami, whose works are partially accessible
in English and other European languages. To translate these wonderful
hymns is to break their melody and bring their soaring passion down to
earth, but not even a prose translation can quite conceal the love of
Truth and the vision of Beauty which inspired them. Listen again to
Jalaluddin:

      "He comes, a moon whose like the sky ne'er saw, awake or dreaming,
        Crowned with eternal flame no flood can lay.
      Lo, from the flagon of Thy love, O Lord, my soul is swimming,
        And ruined all my body's house of clay.

<span id="107"><span class="small">{p. 107}</span></span>

      When first the Giver of the grape my lonely heart befriended,
        Wine fired my bosom and my veins filled up,
      But when His image all mine eye possessed, a voice descended,
        'Well done, O sovereign Wine and peerless Cup!'"

The love thus symbolised is the emotional element in religion, the
rapture of the seer, the courage of the martyr, the faith of the saint,
the only basis of moral perfection and spiritual knowledge. Practically,
it is self-renunciation and self-sacrifice, the giving up of all
possessions--wealth, honour, will, life, and whatever else men
value--for the Beloved's sake without any thought of reward. I have
already referred to love as the supreme principle in Sufi ethics, and
now let me give some illustrations.

> "Love," says Jalaluddin, "is the remedy of our pride and self-conceit,
> the physician of all our infirmities. Only he whose garment is rent by
> love becomes entirely unselfish."

Nuri, Raqqam, and other Sufis were accused of heresy and sentenced to
death.

> "When the executioner approached Raqqam, Nuri rose and offered himself
> in his friend's place with the utmost cheerfulness and submission. All
> the spectators were astounded. The executioner said, 'Young man, the
> sword is not a thing that people are so eager to

<span id="108"><span class="small">{p. 108}</span></span>

> meet; and your turn has not yet arrived.' Nuri answered, 'My religion
> is founded on unselfishness. Life is the most precious thing in the
> world: I wish to sacrifice for my brethren's sake the few moments
> which remain.'"

On another occasion Nuri was overheard praying as follows:

> "O Lord, in Thy eternal knowledge and power and will Thou dost punish
> the people of Hell whom Thou hast created; and if it be Thy inexorable
> will to make Hell full of mankind, Thou art able to fill it with me
> alone, and to send them to Paradise."

In proportion as the Sufi loves God, he sees God in all His creatures,
and goes forth to them in acts of charity. Pious works are naught
without love.

      "Cheer one sad heart: thy loving deed will be
      More than a thousand temples raised by thee.
      One freeman whom thy kindness hath enslaved
      Outweighs by far a thousand slaves set free."

The Moslem *Legend of the Saints* abounds in tales of pity shown to
animals (including the despised dog), birds, and even insects. It is
related that Bayazid purchased some cardamom seed at Hamadhan, and
before departing put into his gaberdine a small quantity which was left
over. On reaching Bistam and recollecting what he had done, he took out
the

<span id="109"><span class="small">{p. 109}</span></span>

seed and found that it contained a number of ants. Saying, "I have
carried the poor creatures away from their home," he immediately set off
and journeyed back to Hamadhan--a distance of several hundred miles.

This universal charity is one of the fruits of pantheism. The ascetic
view of the world which prevailed amongst the early Sufis, and their
vivid consciousness of God as a transcendent Personality rather than as
an immanent Spirit, caused them to crush their human affections
relentlessly. Here is a short story from the life of Fudayl ibn ‘Iyad.
It would be touching if it were not so edifying.

> "One day he had in his lap a child four years old, and chanced to give
> it a kiss, as is the way of fathers. The child said, 'Father, do you
> love me?' 'Yes,' said Fudayl. 'Do you love God?' 'Yes.' 'How many
> hearts have you?' 'One.' 'Then,' asked the child, 'how can you love
> two with one heart?' Fudayl perceived that the child's words were a
> divine admonition. In his zeal for God he began to beat his head and
> repented of his love for the child, and gave his heart wholly to God."

The higher Sufi mysticism, as represented by Jalaluddin Rumi, teaches
that the phenomenal is a bridge to the Real.

      "Whether it be of this world or of that,
      Thy love will lead thee yonder at the last."

<span id="110"><span class="small">{p. 110}</span></span>

\* \* \*

And Jami says, in a passage which has been translated by Professor
Browne:

      "Even from earthly love thy face avert not,
      Since to the Real it may serve to raise thee.
      Ere A, B, C are rightly apprehended,
      How canst thou con the pages of thy Koran?
      A sage (so heard I), unto whom a student
      Came craving counsel on the course before him,
      Said, 'If thy steps be strangers to love's pathways,
      Depart, learn love, and then return before me!
      For, shouldst thou fear to drink wine from Form's flagon,
      Thou canst not drain the draught of the Ideal.
      But yet beware! Be not by Form belated:
      Strive rather with all speed the bridge to traverse.
      If to the bourne thou fain wouldst bear thy baggage,
      Upon the bridge let not thy footsteps linger.'"

Emerson sums up the meaning of this where he says:

> "Beholding in many souls the traits of the divine beauty, and
> separating in each soul that which is divine from the taint which it
> has contracted in the world, the lover ascends to the highest beauty,
> to the love and knowledge of the Divinity, by steps on this ladder of
> created souls."

> "Man's love of God," says Hujwiri, "is a quality which manifests
> itself, in the heart of the pious believer, in the form of veneration
> and magnification, so that he seeks to satisfy his Beloved and becomes
> impatient and restless in his desire for vision of Him, and cannot

<span id="111"><span class="small">{p. 111}</span></span>

> rest with any one except Him, and grows familiar with the recollection
> of Him, and abjures the recollection of everything besides. Repose
> becomes unlawful to him, and rest flees from him. He is cut off from
> all habits and associations, and renounces sensual passion, and turns
> towards the court of love, and submits to the law of love, and knows
> God by His attributes of perfection."

Inevitably such a man will love his fellow-men. Whatever cruelty they
inflict upon him, he will perceive only the chastening hand of God,
"whose bitters are very sweets to the soul." Bayazid said that when God
loves a man, He endows him with three qualities in token thereof: a
bounty like that of the sea, a sympathy like that of the sun, and a
humility like that of the earth. No suffering can be too great, no
devotion too high, for the piercing insight and burning faith of a true
lover.

Ibn al-‘Arabi claims that Islam is peculiarly the religion of love,
inasmuch as the Prophet Mohammed is called God's beloved (*Habib*), but
though some traces of this doctrine occur in the Koran, its main impulse
was unquestionably derived from Christianity. While the oldest Sufi
literature, which is written in Arabic and unfortunately has come down
to us in a fragmentary state, is still dominated by the Koranic
insistence

<span id="112"><span class="small">{p. 112}</span></span>

on fear of Allah, it also bears conspicuous marks of the opposing
Christian tradition. As in Christianity, through Dionysius and other
writers of the Neoplatonic school, so in Islam, and probably under the
same influence, the devotional and mystical love of God soon developed
into ecstasy and enthusiasm which finds in the sensuous imagery of human
love the most suggestive medium for its expression. Dr. Inge observes
that the Sufis "appear, like true Asiatics, to have attempted to give a
sacramental and symbolic character to the indulgence of their passions."
I need not again point out that such a view of genuine Sufism is both
superficial and incorrect.

Love, like gnosis, is in its essence a divine gift, not anything that
can be acquired. "If the whole world wished to attract love, they could
not; and if they made the utmost efforts to repel it, they could not."
Those who love God are those whom God loves. "I fancied that I loved
Him," said Bayazid, "but on consideration I saw that His love preceded
mine." Junayd defined love as the substitution of the qualities of the
Beloved for the qualities of the lover. In other words, love signifies
the passing-away of the individual self; it is an uncontrollable
rapture, a God-sent grace which must be sought by ardent prayer and
aspiration.

<span id="113"><span class="small">{p. 113}</span></span>

\* \* \*

      "O Thou in whose bat well-curved my heart like a ball is laid,
      Nor ever a hairbreadth swerved from Thy bidding nor disobeyed,
      I have washed mine outward clean, the water I drew and poured;
      Mine inward is Thy demesne--do Thou keep it stainless, Lord!"

Jalaluddin teaches that man's love is really the effect of God's love by
means of an apologue. One night a certain devotee was praying aloud,
when Satan appeared to him and said:

> "How long wilt thou cry, 'O Allah'? Be quiet, for thou wilt get no
> answer." The devotee hung his head in silence. After a little while he
> had a vision of the prophet Khadir, who said to him, "Ah, why hast
> thou ceased to call on God?" "Because the answer 'Here am I' came
> not," he replied. Khadir said, "God hath ordered me to go to thee and
> say this:

      "'Was it not I that summoned thee to service?
      Did not I make thee busy with My name?
      Thy calling "Allah!" was My "Here am I,"
      Thy yearning pain My messenger to thee.
      Of all those tears and cries and supplications
      I was the magnet, and I gave them wings.'"

Divine love is beyond description, yet its signs are manifest. Sari
al-Saqati questioned Junayd concerning the nature of love.

<span id="114"><span class="small">{p. 114}</span></span>

\* \* \*

Love,'the astrolabe of heavenly mysteries,' inspires all religion worthy
of the name, and brings with it, not reasoned belief, but the intense
conviction arising from immediate intuition. This inner light is its own
evidence; he who sees it has real knowledge, and nothing can increase or
diminish his certainty. Hence the Sufis never weary of exposing the
futility of a faith which supports itself on intellectual proofs,
external authority, self-interest, or self-regard of any kind. The
barren dialectic of the theologian; the canting righteousness of the
Pharisee rooted in forms and ceremonies; the less crude but equally
undisinterested worship of which the motive is desire to gain
everlasting happiness in the life hereafter; the relatively pure
devotion of the mystic who, although he loves God, yet thinks of himself
as loving, and whose heart is not

<span id="115"><span class="small">{p. 115}</span></span>

wholly emptied of 'otherness'--all these are 'veils' to be removed.

A few sayings by those who know will be more instructive than further
explanation.

> "O God! whatever share of this world Thou hast allotted to me, bestow
> it on Thine enemies; and whatever share of the next world Thou hast
> allotted to me, bestow it on Thy friends. Thou art enough for me."
> (RABI‘A.)

> "O God! if I worship Thee in fear of Hell, burn me in Hell; and if I
> worship Thee in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise; but if I
> worship Thee for Thine own sake, withhold not Thine everlasting
> beauty!" (RABI‘A.)

> "Notwithstanding that the lovers of God are separated from Him by
> their love, they have the essential thing, for whether they sleep or
> wake, they seek and are sought, and are not occupied with their own
> seeking and loving, but are enraptured in contemplation of the
> Beloved. It is a crime in the lover to regard his love, and an outrage
> in love to look at one's own seeking while one is face to face with
> the Sought." (BAYAZID.)

> "His love entered and removed all besides Him and left no trace of
> anything else, so that it remained single even as He is single."
> (BAYAZID.)

<span id="116"><span class="small">{p. 116}</span></span>

\* \* \*

> "To feel at one with God for a moment is better than all men's acts of
> worship from the beginning to the end of the world." (SHIBLI.)

> "Fear of the Fire, in comparison with fear of being parted from the
> Beloved, is like a drop of water cast into the mightiest ocean." (DHU
> ’L-NUN.)

      "Unless I have the face of my heart towards Thee,
      I deem prayer unworthy to be reckoned as prayer.
      If I turn my face to the Ka‘ba, 'tis for love of Thine;
      Otherwise I am quit both of prayer and Ka‘ba."
      (JALALUDDIN RUMI.)

Love, again, is the divine instinct of the soul impelling it to realise
its nature and destiny. The soul is the first-born of God: before the
creation of the universe it lived and moved and had its being in Him,
and during its earthly manifestation it is a stranger in exile, ever
pining to return to its home.

      "This is Love: to fly heavenward,
      To rend, every instant, a hundred veils;
      The first moment, to renounce life;
      The last step, to fare without feet;
      To regard this world as invisible,
      Not to see what appears to one's self."

All the love-romances and allegories of Sufi poetry--the tales of Layla
and Majnun, Yusuf (Joseph) and Zulaykha, Salaman and Absal, the Moth and
the Candle, the Night-

<span id="117"><span class="small">{p. 117}</span></span>

ingale and the Rose--are shadow-pictures of the soul's passionate
longing to be reunited with God. It is impossible, in the brief space at
my command, to give the reader more than a passing glimpse of the
treasures which the exuberant fancy of the East has heaped together in
every room of this enchanted palace. The soul is likened to a moaning
dove that has lost her mate; to a reed torn from its bed and made into a
flute whose plaintive music fills the eye with tears; to a falcon
summoned by the fowler's whistle to perch again upon his wrist; to snow
melting in the sun and mounting as vapour to the sky; to a frenzied
camel swiftly plunging through the desert by night; to a caged parrot, a
fish on dry land, a pawn that seeks to become a king.

These figures imply that God is conceived as transcendent, and that the
soul cannot reach Him without taking what Plotinus in a splendid phrase
calls "the flight of the Alone to the Alone." Jalaluddin says:

      "The motion of every atom is towards its origin;
      A man comes to be the thing on which he is bent.
      By the attraction of fondness and yearning, the soul and the heart
      Assume the qualities of the Beloved, who is the Soul of souls."

'A man comes to be the thing on which he is bent': what, then does the
Sufi

<span id="118"><span class="small">{p. 118}</span></span>

become? Eckhart in one of his sermons quotes the saying of St. Augustine
that Man *is* what he loves, and adds this comment:

> "If he loves a stone, he is a stone; if he loves a man, he is a man;
> if he loves God--I dare not say more, for if I said that he would then
> be God, ye might stone me."

The Moslem mystics enjoyed greater freedom of speech than their
Christian brethren who owed allegiance to the medieval Catholic Church,
and if they went too far the plea of ecstasy was generally accepted as a
sufficient excuse. Whether they emphasise the outward or the inward
aspect of unification, the transcendence or the immanence of God, their
expressions are bold and uncompromising. Thus Abu Sa‘id:

      "In my heart Thou dwellest--else with blood I'll drench it;
      In mine eye Thou glowest--else with tears I'll quench it.
      Only to be one with Thee my soul desireth--
      Else from out my body, by hook or crook, I'll wrench it!"

Jalaluddin Rumi proclaims that the soul's love of God is God's love of
the soul, and that in loving the soul God loves Himself, for He draws
home to Himself that which in its essence is divine.

"Our copper," says the poet, "has been transmuted by this rare alchemy,"

<span id="119"><span class="small">{p. 119}</span></span>

meaning that the base alloy of self has been purified and spiritualised.
In another ode he says:

      "O my soul, I searched from end to end: I saw in thee naught save
        the Beloved;
      Call me not infidel, O my soul, if I say that thou thyself art He."

And yet more plainly:

      "Ye who in search of God, of God, pursue,
      Ye need not search for God is you, is you!
      Why seek ye something that was missing ne'er?
      Save you none is, but you are--where, oh, where?"

Where is the lover when the Beloved has displayed Himself? Nowhere and
everywhere: his individuality has passed away from him. In the bridal
chamber of Unity God celebrates the mystical marriage of the soul.

## CHAPTER V

### SAINTS AND MIRACLES

LET us suppose that the average Moslem could read English, and that we
placed in his hands one of those admirable volumes published by the
Society for Psychical Research. In order to sympathise with his feelings
on such an occasion, we have only to imagine what our own would be if a
scientific friend invited us to study a treatise setting forth the
evidence in favour of telegraphy and recording well-attested instances
of telegraphic communication. The Moslem would probably see in the
telegraph some kind of spirit--an *afreet* or *jinni*. Telepathy and
similar occult phenomena he takes for granted as self-evident facts. It
would never occur to him to investigate them. There is something in the
constitution of his mind that makes it impervious to the idea that the
supernatural may be subject to law. He believes, because he cannot help
believing, in the reality of an unseen world which 'lies about us,' not
in our infancy alone, but always and every-

<span id="121"><span class="small">{p. 121}</span></span>

where; a world from which we are in no wise excluded, accessible and in
some measure revealed to all, though free and open intercourse with it
is a privilege enjoyed by few. Many are called but few chosen.

      "Spirits every night from the body's snare
      Thou freest, and makest the tablets clean.
      {By erasing all the sensuous impressions which form a veil between
        the soul and the world of reality.}
      Spirits are set free every night from this cage,
      Independent, neither ruled nor ruling.
      At night prisoners forget their prison,
      At night kings forget their power:
      No sorrow, no brooding over gain and loss,
      No thought of this person or that person.
      This is the state of the gnostic, even when he is awake;
      God hath said, 'Thou wouldst deem them awake while they slept.'
        {Kor. 18.17}
      He is asleep, day and night, to the affairs of the world,
      Like a pen in the controlling hand of the Lord."

The Sufis have always declared and believed themselves to be God's
chosen people. The Koran refers in several places to His elect.
According to the author of the *Kitab al-Luma‘*, this title belongs,
firstly, to the prophets, elect in virtue of their sinlessness, their
inspiration, and their apostolic mission; and secondly, to certain
Moslems, elect in virtue of their sincere devotion and
self-mortification and firm attachment to the

<span id="122"><span class="small">{p. 122}</span></span>

eternal realities: in a word, the saints. While the Sufis are the elect
of the Moslem community, the saints are the elect of the Sufis.

The Mohammedan saint is commonly known as a *wali* (plural, *awliya*).
This word is used in various senses derived from its root-meaning of
'nearness'; *e.g.* next of kin, patron, protector, friend. It is applied
in the Koran to God as the protector of the Faithful, to angels or idols
who are supposed to protect their worshippers, and to men who are
regarded as being specially under divine protection. Mohammed twits the
Jews with professing to be *protégés* of God (*awliya lillah*).
Notwithstanding its somewhat equivocal associations, the term was taken
over by the Sufis and became the ordinary designation of persons whose
holiness brings them near to God, and who receive from Him, as tokens of
His peculiar favour, miraculous gifts (*karamat*, *«charísmata»*); they
are His friends, on whom "no fear shall come and they shall not grieve"
<span class="small">{[Kor. 10.63](../pick/010.htm#010_062.md)}</span>; any
injury done to them is an act of hostility against Him.

The inspiration of the Islamic saints, though verbally distinguished
from that of the prophets and inferior in degree, is of the same kind.
In consequence of their intimate relation to God, the veil shrouding the

<span id="123"><span class="small">{p. 123}</span></span>

supernatural, or, as a Moslem would say, the unseen world, from their
perceptions is withdrawn at intervals, and in their fits of ecstasy they
rise to the prophetic level. Neither deep learning in divinity, nor
devotion to good works, nor asceticism, nor moral purity makes the
Mohammedan a saint; he may have all or none of these things, but the
only indispensable qualification is that ecstasy and rapture which is
the outward sign of 'passing-away' from the phenomenal self. Anyone thus
enraptured (*majdhub*) is a *wali* <span class="small">{*Waliyyat*, if
the saint is a woman.}</span>, and when such persons are recognised
through their power of working miracles, they are venerated as saints
not only after death but also during their lives. Often, however, they
live and die in obscurity. Hujwiri tells us that amongst the saints
"there are four thousand who are concealed and do not know one another
and are not aware of the excellence of their state, being in all
circumstances hidden from themselves and from mankind."

The saints form an invisible hierarchy, on which the order of the world
is thought to depend. Its supreme head is entitled the *Qutb* (Axis). He
is the most eminent Sufi of his age, and presides over the meetings
regularly held by this august parliament, whose members are not hampered
in their attendance by the inconvenient fictions of

<span id="124"><span class="small">{p. 124}</span></span>

time and space, but come together from all parts of the earth in the
twinkling of an eye, traversing seas and mountains and deserts as easily
as common mortals step across a road. Below the *Qutb* stand various
classes and grades of sanctity. Hujwiri enumerates them, in ascending
series, as follows: three hundred *Akhyar* (Good), forty *Abdal*
(Substitutes), seven *Abrar* (Pious), four *Awtad* (Supports), and three
*Nuqaba* (Overseers).

> "All these know one another and cannot act save by mutual consent. It
> is the task of the *Awtad* to go round the whole world every night,
> and if there should be any place on which their eyes have not fallen,
> next day some flaw will appear in that place, and they must then
> inform the *Qutb* in order that he may direct his attention to the
> weak spot and that by his blessing the imperfection may be remedied."

We are studying in this book the mystical life of the individual Moslem,
and it is necessary to keep the subject within the narrowest bounds.
Otherwise, I should have liked to dwell on the external and historical
organisation of Sufism as a school for saints, and to describe the
process of evolution through which the *wali* privately conversing with
a small circle of friends became, first, a teacher and spiritual guide
gathering

<span id="125"><span class="small">{p. 125}</span></span>

disciples around him during his lifetime, and finally the head of a
perpetual religious order which bore his name. The earliest of these
great fraternities date from the twelfth century. In addition to their
own members--the so-called 'dervishes'--each order has a large number of
lay brethren attached to it, so that their influence pervades all ranks
of Moslem society. They are "independent and self-developing. There is
rivalry between them; but no one rules over the other. In faith and
practice each goes its own way, limited only by the universal conscience
of Islam. Thus strange doctrines and grave moral defects easily develop
unheeded, but freedom is saved." <span class="small">{D. B. Macdonald,
*The Religious Life and Attitude in Islam*, p. 164.}</span> Of course,
the typical *wali* is incapable of founding an order, but Islam has
produced no less frequently than Christendom men who combine intense
spiritual illumination with creative energy and aptitude for affairs on
a grand scale. The Mohammedan notion of the saint as a person possessed
by God allows a very wide application of the term: in popular usage it
extends from the greatest Sufi theosophists, like Jalaluddin Rumi and
Ibn al-‘Arabi, down to those who have gained sanctity only by losing
sanity--victims of epilepsy and hysteria, half-witted idiots and
harmless lunatics.

<span id="126"><span class="small">{p. 126}</span></span>

\* \* \*

Both Qushayri <span class="small">{Author of a famous work designed to
close the breach between Sufism and Islam. He died in 1074 A.D.}</span>
and Hujwiri discuss the question whether a saint can be conscious of his
saintship, and answer it in the affirmative. Their opponents argue that
consciousness of saintship involves assurance of salvation, which is
impossible, since no one can know with certainty that he shall be among
the saved on the Day of Judgment. In reply it was urged that God may
miraculously assure the saint of his predestined salvation, while
maintaining him in a state of spiritual soundness and preserving him
from disobedience. The saint is not immaculate, as the prophets are, but
the divine protection which he enjoys is a guarantee that he will not
persevere in evil courses, though he may temporarily be led astray.
According to the view generally held, saintship depends on faith, not on
conduct, so that no sin except infidelity can cause it to be forfeited.
This perilous theory, which opens the door to antinomianism, was
mitigated by the emphasis laid on fulfilment of the religious law. The
following anecdote of Bayazid al-Bistami shows the official attitude of
all the leading Sufis who are cited as authorities in the Moslem
text-books.

> "I was told (he said) that a saint of God was living in such-and-such
> a town,

<span id="127"><span class="small">{p. 127}</span></span>

> and I set out to visit him. When I entered the mosque, he came forth
> from his chamber and spat on the floor. I turned back without saluting
> him, saying to myself, 'A saint must keep the religious law in order
> that God may keep him in his spiritual state. Had this man been a
> saint, his respect for the law would have prevented him from spitting
> on the floor, or God would have saved him from marring the grace
> vouchsafed to him."

Many *walis*, however, regard the law as a curb that is indeed necessary
so long as one remains in the disciplinary stage, but may be discarded
by the saint. Such a person, they declare, stands on a higher plane than
ordinary men, and is not to be condemned for actions which outwardly
seem irreligious. While the older Sufis insist that a *wali* who breaks
the law is thereby shown to be an impostor, the popular belief in the
saints and the rapid growth of saint-worship tended to aggrandise the
*wali* at the expense of the law, and to foster the conviction that a
divinely gifted man can do no wrong, or at least that his actions must
not be judged by appearances. The classical instance of this *jus
divinum* vested in the friends of God is the story of Moses and Khadir,
which is related in the Koran ([18.64-80](../pick/018.htm#018_065).md).
Khadir or Khizr--the Koran does not mention him by name

<span id="128"><span class="small">{p. 128}</span></span>

--is a mysterious sage endowed with immortality, who is said to enter
into conversation with wandering Sufis and impart to them his God-given
knowledge. Moses desired to accompany him on a journey that he might
profit by his teaching, and Khadir consented, only stipulating that
Moses should ask no questions of him.

> "So they both went on, till they embarked in a boat and he (Khadir)
> staved it in. 'What!' cried Moses, 'hast thou staved it in that thou
> mayst drown its crew? Verily, a strange thing hast thou done.'

> "He said, 'Did not I tell thee that thou couldst no way have patience
> with me?'

> "Then they went on until they met a youth, and he slew him. Said
> Moses, 'Hast thou slain him who is free from guilt of blood? Surely
> now thou hast wrought an unheard-of thing!'"

After Moses had broken his promise of silence for the third time, Khadir
resolved to leave him.

> "But first," he said, "I will tell thee the meaning of that with which
> thou couldst not have patience. As to the boat, it belonged to poor
> men, toilers on the sea, and I was minded to damage it, for in their
> rear was a king who seized on every boat by force. And

<span id="129"><span class="small">{p. 129}</span></span>

> as to the youth, his parents were believers, and I feared lest he
> should trouble them by error and unbelief."

The Sufis are fond of quoting this unimpeachable testimony that the
*wali* is above human criticism, and that his hand, as Jalaluddin
asserts, is even as the hand of God. Most Moslems admit the claim to be
valid in so far as they shrink from applying conventional standards of
morality to holy men. I have explained its metaphysical justification in
an earlier chapter.

A miracle performed by a saint is termed *karamat*, *i.e.* a 'favour'
which God bestows upon him, whereas a miracle performed by a prophet is
called *mu‘jizat*, *i.e.* an act which cannot be imitated by any one.
The distinction originated in controversy, and was used to answer those
who held the miraculous powers of the saints to be a grave encroachment
on the prerogative of the Prophet. Sufi apologists, while confessing
that both kinds of miracle are substantially the same, take pains to
differentiate the characteristics of each; they declare, moreover, that
the saints are the Prophet's witnesses, and that all their miracles
(like 'a drop trickling from a full skin of honey') are in reality
derived from him. This is the orthodox view and is supported by those
Mohammedan mystics who acknowledge the Law as well

<span id="130"><span class="small">{p. 130}</span></span>

as the Truth, though in some cases it may have amounted to little more
than a pious opinion. We have often noticed the difficulty in which the
Sufis find themselves when they try to make a logical compromise with
Islam. But the word 'logic' is very misleading in this connexion. The
beginning of wisdom, for European students of Oriental religion, lies in
the discovery that incongruous beliefs--I mean, of course, beliefs which
our minds cannot harmonise--dwell peacefully together in the Oriental
brain; that their owner is quite unconscious of their incongruity; and
that, as a rule, he is absolutely sincere. Contradictions which seem
glaring to us do not trouble him at all.

The thaumaturgic element in ancient Sufism was not so important as it
afterwards became in the fully developed saint-worship associated with
the Dervish Orders. "A saint would be none the less a saint," says
Qushayri, "if no miracles were wrought by him in this world." In early
Mohammedan *Vitæ Sanctorum* it is not uncommon to meet with sayings to
the effect that miraculous powers are comparatively of small account. It
was finely said by Sahl ibn ‘Abdallah that the greatest miracle is the
substitution of a good quality for a bad one; and the *Kitab al-Luma‘*
gives many examples of holy men who disliked miracles and regarded them
as a temptation.

<span id="131"><span class="small">{p. 131}</span></span>

"During my novitiate," said Bayazid, "God used to bring before me
wonders and miracles, but I paid no heed to them; and when He saw that I
did so, He gave me the means of attaining to knowledge of Himself."
Junayd observed that reliance on miracles is one of the 'veils' which
hinder the elect from penetrating to the inmost shrine of the Truth.
This was too high doctrine for the great mass of Moslems, and in the end
the vulgar idea of saintship triumphed over the mystical and
theosophical conception. All such warnings and scruples were swept aside
by the same irresistible instinct which rendered vain the solemn
asseverations of Mohammed that there was nothing supernatural about him,
and which transformed the human Prophet of history into an omnipotent
hierophant and magician. The popular demand for miracles far exceeded
the supply, but where the *walis* failed, a vivid and credulous
imagination came to their rescue and represented them, not as they were,
but as they ought to be. Year by year the *Legend of the Saints* grew
more glorious and wonderful as it continued to draw fresh tribute from
the unfathomable ocean of Oriental romance. The pretensions made by the
*walis*, or on their behalf, steadily increased, and the stories told of
them were ever becoming more fantastic and extravagant. I will devote

<span id="132"><span class="small">{p. 132}</span></span>

the remainder of this chapter to a sketch of the *wali* as he appears in
the vast medieval literature on the subject.

The Moslem saint does not say that he has wrought a miracle; he says, "a
miracle was granted or manifested to me." According to one view, he may
be fully conscious at the time, but many Sufis hold that such
'manifestation' cannot take place except in ecstasy, when the saint is
entirely under divine control. His own personality is then in abeyance,
and those who interfere with him oppose the Almighty Power which speaks
with his lips and smites with his hand. Jalaluddin (who uses
incidentally the rather double-edged analogy of a man possessed by a
peri <span class="small">{One of the spirits called collectively
Jinn.}</span>) relates the following anecdote concerning Bayazid of
Bistam, a celebrated Persian saint who several times declared in
ecstatic frenzy that he was no other than God.

After coming to himself on one of these occasions and learning what
blasphemous language he had uttered, Bayazid ordered his disciples to
stab him with their knives if he should offend again. Let me quote the
sequel, from Mr. Whinfield's abridged translation of the *Masnavi* (p.
196):

      "The torrent of madness bore away his reason
      And he spoke more impiously than before:
      'Within my vesture is naught but God,

<span id="133"><span class="small">{p. 133}</span></span>

      Whether you seek Him on earth or in heaven.'
      His disciples all became mad with horror,
      And struck with their knives at his holy body.
      Each one who aimed at the body of the Sheykh--
      His stroke was reversed and wounded the striker.
      No stroke took effect on that man of spiritual gifts,
      But the disciples were wounded and drowned in blood."

Here is the poet's conclusion:

      "Ah! you who smite with your sword him beside himself,
      You smite yourself therewith. Beware!
      For he that is beside himself is annihilated and safe;
      Yea, he dwells in security for ever.
      His form is vanished, he is a mere mirror;
      Nothing is seen in him but the reflexion of another.
      If you spit at it, you spit at your own face,
      And if you hit that mirror, you hit yourself.
      If you see an ugly face in it, 'tis your own,
      And if you see a Jesus there, you are its mother Mary.
      He is neither this nor that--he is void of form;
      'Tis your own form which is reflected back to you."

The life of Abu ’l-Hasan Khurqani, another Persian Sufi who died in 1033
A.D., gives us a complete picture of the Oriental pantheist, and
exhibits the mingled arrogance and sublimity of the character as clearly
as could be desired. Since the original text covers fifty pages, I can
translate only a small portion of it here.

> "Once the Sheykh said, 'This night a great many persons (he mentioned

> desert.'

<span id="134"><span class="small">{p. 134}</span></span>

> On making inquiry, they found that his statement was perfectly true.

\* \* \*

It would be an almost endless task to enumerate and exemplify the
different classes of miracles which are related in the lives of the
Mohammedan saints--for instance, walking on water, flying in the air
(with or without a passenger), rain-making, appearing in various places
at the same time, healing by the breath, bringing the dead to life,
knowledge and prediction of future events, thought-reading, telekinesis,
paralysing or beheading an obnoxious person by a word or gesture,
conversing with animals or plants, turning earth into gold or precious
stones, producing food and drink, etc. To the Moslem, who has no sense
of natural law, all these 'violations of custom,' as he calls them, seem
equally credible. We, on the other hand, feel ourselves obliged to
distinguish phenomena which we regard as irrational and impossible from
those for which we can find some sort of 'natural' explanation. Modern
theories of psychical influence, faith-healing, telepathy, veridical
hallucination, hypnotic suggestion and the like, have thrown open to us
a wide avenue of approach to this dark continent in the Eastern mind. I
will not, however, pursue the subject far at present, full of interest
as it is. In the higher Sufi teaching the miraculous powers of the
saints play a more or less insignificant part, and the excessive
importance which they assume in the organ-

<span id="140"><span class="small">{p. 140}</span></span>

ised mysticism of the Dervish Orders is one of the clearest marks of its
degeneracy.

The following passage, which I have slightly modified, gives a fair
summary of the hypnotic process through which a dervish attains to union
with God:

> "The disciple must, mystically, always bear his Murshid (spiritual
> director) in mind, and become mentally absorbed in him through a
> constant meditation and contemplation of him. The teacher must be his
> shield against all evil thoughts. The spirit of the teacher follows
> him in all his efforts, and accompanies him wherever he may be, quite
> as a guardian spirit. To such a degree is this carried that he sees
> the master in all men and in all things, just as a willing subject is
> under the influence of the magnetiser. This condition is called
> 'self-annihilation' in the Murshid or Sheykh. The latter finds, in his
> own visionary dreams, the degree which the disciple has reached, and
> whether or not his spirit has become bound to his own.

> "At this stage the Sheykh passes him over to the spiritual influence
> of the long-deceased Pir or original founder of the Order, and he sees
> the latter only by the spiritual aid of the Sheykh. This is called
> 'self-annihilation' in the Pir. He

<span id="141"><span class="small">{p. 141}</span></span>

> now becomes so much a part of the Pir as to possess all his spiritual
> powers.

> "The third grade leads him, also through the spiritual aid of the
> Sheykh, up to the Prophet himself, whom he now sees in all things.
> This state is called 'self-annihilation' in the Prophet.

> "The fourth degree leads him even to God. He becomes united with the
> Deity and sees Him in all things." <span class="small">{J. P. Brown,
> *The Dervishes, or Oriental Spiritualism* (1868), p. 298.}</span>

An excellent concrete illustration of the process here described will be
found in the well-known case of Tawakkul Beg, who passed through all
these experiences under the control of Molla-Shah. His account is too
long to quote in full; moreover, it has recently been translated by
Professor D. B. Macdonald in his *Religious Life and Attitude in Islam*
(pp. 197 ff.). I copy from this version one paragraph describing the
first of the four stages mentioned above.

> "Thereupon he made me sit before him, my senses being as though
> intoxicated, and ordered me to reproduce my own image within myself;
> and, after having bandaged my eyes, he asked me to concentrate all my
> mental faculties on my heart. I obeyed, and in an instant, by the
> divine favour and by the spiritual assistance of the Sheykh, my

<span id="142"><span class="small">{p. 142}</span></span>

> heart opened. I saw, then, that there was something like an overturned
> cup within me. This having been set upright, a sensation of unbounded
> happiness filled my being. I said to the master, 'This cell where I am
> seated before you--I see a faithful reproduction of it within me, and
> it appears to me as though another Tawakkul Beg were seated before
> another Molla-Shah.' He replied, 'Very good! the first apparition
> which appears to thee is the image of the master.' He then ordered me
> to uncover my eyes; and I saw him, with the physical organ of vision,
> seated before me. He then made me bind my eyes again, and I perceived
> him with my spiritual sight, seated similarly before me. Full of
> astonishment, I cried out, 'O Master! whether I look with my physical
> organs or with my spiritual sight, always it is you that I see!'"

Here is a case of autohypnotism, witnessed and recorded by the poet
Jami:

> "Mawlana Sa‘duddin of Kashghar, after a little concentration of
> thought (*tawajjuh*), used to exhibit signs of unconsciousness. Anyone
> ignorant of this circumstance would have fancied that he was falling
> asleep. When I first entered into companionship with him,

<span id="143"><span class="small">{p. 143}</span></span>

> I happened one day to be seated before him in the congregational
> mosque. According to his custom, he fell into a trance. I supposed
> that he was going to sleep, and I said to him, 'If you desire to rest
> for a short time, you will not seem to me to be far off.' He smiled
> and said, 'Apparently you do not believe that this is something
> different from sleep.'"

The following anecdote presents greater difficulties:

> "Mawlana Nizamuddin Khamush relates that one day his master,
> ‘Ala’uddin ‘Attar, started to visit the tomb of the celebrated saint
> Mohammed ibn ‘Ali Hakim, at Tirmidh. 'I did not accompany him,' said
> Nizamuddin, 'but stayed at home, and by concentrating my mind
> (*tawajjuh*) I succeeded in bringing the spirituality of the saint
> before me, so that when the master arrived at the tomb he found it
> empty. He must have known the cause, for on his return he set to work
> in order to bring me under his control. I, too, concentrated my mind,
> but I found myself like a dove and the master like a hawk flying in
> chase of me. Wherever I turned, he was always close behind. At last,
> despairing of escape, I took refuge with the spirituality of the

<span id="144"><span class="small">{p. 144}</span></span>

> Prophet (on whom be peace) and became effaced in its infinite
> radiance. The master could not exercise any further control. He fell
> ill in consequence of his chagrin, and no one except myself knew the
> reason.'"

‘Ala’uddin's son, Khwaja Hasan ‘Attar, possessed such powers of
'control' that he could at will throw any one into the state of trance
and cause them to experience the 'passing-away' (*fana*) to which some
mystics attain only on rare occasions and after prolonged
self-mortification. It is related that the disciples and visitors who
were admitted to the honour of kissing his hand always fell unconscious
to the ground.

Certain saints are believed to have the power of assuming whatever shape
they please. One of the most famous was Abd ‘Abdallah of Mosul, better
known by the name of Qadib al-Ban. One day the Cadi of Mosul, who
regarded him as a detestable heretic, saw him in a street of the town,
approaching from the opposite direction. He resolved to seize him and
lay a charge against him before the governor, in order that he might be
punished. All at once he perceived that Qadib al-Ban had taken the form
of a Kurd; and as the saint advanced towards him, his appearance changed
again, this time into an Arab of the desert. Finally, on coming still
nearer, he assumed the guise

<span id="145"><span class="small">{p. 145}</span></span>

and dress of a doctor of theology, and cried, "O Cadi! which Qadib
al-Ban will you hale before the governor and punish?" The Cadi repented
of his hostility and became one of the saint's disciples.

In conclusion, let me give two alleged instances of 'the obedience of
inanimate objects,' *i.e.* telekinesis:

> "Whilst Dhu ’l-Nun was conversing on this topic with some friends, he
> said, 'Here is a sofa. It will move round the room, if I tell it to do
> so.' No sooner had he uttered the word 'move' than the sofa made a
> circuit of the room and returned to its place. One of the spectators,
> a young man, burst into tears and gave up the ghost. They laid him on
> that sofa and washed him for burial."

> "Avicenna paid a visit to Abu ’l-Hasan Khurqani and immediately
> plunged into a long and abstruse discussion. After a time the saint,
> who was an illiterate person, felt tired, so he got up and said,
> 'Excuse me; I must go and mend the garden wall'; and off he went,
> taking a hatchet with him. As soon as he had climbed on to the top of
> the wall, the hatchet dropped from his hand. Avicenna ran to pick it
> up, but before he reached it the hatchet rose of itself and came back

<span id="146"><span class="small">{p. 146}</span></span>

> into the saint's hand. Avicenna lost all his self-command, and the
> enthusiastic belief in Sufism which then took possession of him
> continued until, at a later period of his life, he abandoned mysticism
> for philosophy."

I am well aware that in this chapter scanty justice has been done to a
great subject. The historian of Sufism must acknowledge, however deeply
he may deplore, the fundamental position occupied by the doctrine of
saintship and the tremendous influence which it has exerted in its
practical results--grovelling submission to the authority of an ecstatic
class of men, dependence on their favour, pilgrimage to their shrines,
adoration of their relics, devotion of every mental and spiritual
faculty to their service. It may be dangerous to worship God by one's
own inner light, but it is far more deadly to seek Him by the inner
light of another. Vicarious holiness has no compensations. This truth is
expressed by the mystical writers in many an eloquent passage, but I
will content myself with quoting a few lines from the life of ‘Ala’uddin
‘Attar, the same saint who, as we have seen, vainly tried to hypnotise
his pupil in revenge for a disrespectful trick which the latter had
played on him. His biographer relates that he said, "It is more right
and worthy to

<span id="147"><span class="small">{p. 147}</span></span>

dwell beside God than to dwell beside God's creatures," and that the
following verse was often on his blessed tongue:

      "How long will you worship at the tombs of holy men?
      Busy yourself with the works of holy men, and you are saved!"

        ("tu ta kay gur-i mardan-ra parasti
        bi-gird-i kar-i mardan gard u rasti.")

## CHAPTER VI

### THE UNITIVE STATE

      "The story admits of being told up to this point,
      But what follows is hidden, and inexpressible in words.
      If you should speak and try a hundred ways to express it,
      'Tis useless; the mystery becomes no clearer,
      You can ride on saddle and horse to the sea-coast,
      But then you must use a horse of wood (i.e. a boat).
      A horse of wood is useless on dry land,
      It is the special vehicle of voyagers by sea.
      Silence is this horse of wood,
      Silence is the guide and support of men at sea."
      {The Masnavi of Jalaluddin Rumi. Abridged translation by
        E. H. Whinfield, p.326.}

No one can approach the subject of this chapter--the state of the mystic
who has reached his journey's end--without feeling that all symbolical
descriptions of union with God and theories concerning its nature are
little better than leaps in the dark. How shall we form any conception
of that which is declared to be ineffable by those who have actually
experienced it? I can only reply that the same difficulty confronts us
in dealing with all mystical phenomena,

<span id="149"><span class="small">{p. 149}</span></span>

though it appears less formidable at lower levels, and that the poet's
counsel of silence has not prevented him from interpreting the deepest
mysteries of Sufism with unrivalled insight and power.

Whatever terms may be used to describe it, the unitive state is the
culmination of the simplifying process by which the soul is gradually
isolated from all that is foreign to itself, from all that is not God.
Unlike Nirvana, which is merely the cessation of individuality, *fana*,
the passing-away of the Sufi from his phenomenal existence, involves
*baqa*, the continuance of his real existence. He who dies to self lives
in God, and *fana*, the consummation of this death, marks the attainment
of *baqa*, or union with the divine life. Deification, in short, is the
Moslem mystic's *ultima Thule*.

In the early part of the tenth century Husayn ibn Mansur, known to fame
as al-Hallaj (the wool-carder), was barbarously done to death at
Baghdad. His execution seems to have been dictated by political motives,
but with these we are not concerned. Amongst the crowd assembled round
the scaffold, a few, perhaps, believed him to be what he said he was;
the rest witnessed with exultation or stern approval the punishment of a
blasphemous heretic. He had uttered in two words a sentence which Islam
has, on the whole, forgiven but has

<span id="150"><span class="small">{p. 150}</span></span>

never forgotten: "*Ana ’l-Haqq*"--"I am God."

The recently published researches of M. Louis Massignon <span
class="small">{*Kitab al-Tawasin* (Paris, 1913). See especially pp.
129-141.}</span> make it possible, for the first time, to indicate the
meaning which Hallaj himself attached to this celebrated formula, and to
assert definitely that it does not agree with the more orthodox
interpretations offered at a later epoch by Sufis belonging to various
schools. According to Hallaj, man is essentially divine. God created
Adam in His own image. He projected from Himself that image of His
eternal love, that He might behold Himself as in a mirror. Hence He bade
the angels worship Adam ([Kor. 2.32](../pick/002.htm#002_034).md), in whom,
as in Jesus, He became incarnate.

      "Glory to Him who revealed in His humanity (i.e. in Adam)
        the secret of His radiant divinity,
      And then appeared to His creatures visibly in the shape of one
        who ate and drank (Jesus)."

Since the 'humanity' (*nasut*) of God comprises the whole bodily and
spiritual nature of man, the 'divinity' (*lahut*) of God cannot unite
with that nature except by means of an incarnation or, to adopt the term
employed by Massignon, an infusion (*hulul*) of the divine Spirit, such
as takes place when the human spirit enters the

<span id="151"><span class="small">{p. 151}</span></span>

body. <span class="small">{Massignon appears to be right in identifying
the Divine Spirit with the Active Reason (*intellectus agens*), which,
according to Alexander of Aphrodisias, is not a part or faculty of our
soul, but comes to us from without. See Inge, *Christian Mysticism*, pp.
360, 361. The doctrine of Hallaj may be compared with that of Tauler,
Ruysbroeck, and others concerning the birth of God in the soul.}</span>
Thus Hallaj says in one of his poems:

      "Thy Spirit is mingled in my spirit even as wine is mingled with
        pure water.
      When anything touches Thee, it touches me. Lo, in every case Thou
        art I!"

And again:

      "I am He whom I love, and He whom I love is I:
      We are two spirits dwelling in one body.
      If thou seest me, thou seest Him,
      And if thou seest Him, thou seest us both."

This doctrine of personal deification, in the peculiar form which was
impressed upon it by Hallaj, is obviously akin to the central doctrine
of Christianity, and therefore, from the Moslem standpoint, a heresy of
the worst kind. It survived unadulterated only amongst his immediate
followers. The Hululis, *i.e.* those who believe in incarnation, are
repudiated by Sufis in general quite as vehemently as by orthodox
Moslems. But while the former have unhesitatingly condemned the doctrine
of *hulul*, they have also done their best to clear Hallaj from the
suspicion of having taught it. Three main lines of defence are followed:
(1)

<span id="152"><span class="small">{p. 152}</span></span>

Hallaj did not sin against the Truth, but he was justly punished in so
far as he committed a grave offence against the Law. He "betrayed the
secret of his Lord" by proclaiming to all and sundry the supreme mystery
which ought to be reserved for the elect. (2) Hallaj spoke under the
intoxicating influence of ecstasy. He imagined himself to be united with
the divine essence, when in fact he was only united with one of the
divine attributes. (3) Hallaj meant to declare that there is no
essential difference or separation between God and His creatures,
inasmuch as the divine unity includes all being. A man who has entirely
passed away from his phenomenal self exists *quâ* his real self, which
is God.

      "In that glory is no 'I' or 'We' or 'Thou.'
      'I,' 'We,' 'Thou,' and 'He' are all one thing."

It was not Hallaj who cried "*Ana ’l-Haqq*," but God Himself, speaking,
as it were, by the mouth of the selfless Hallaj, just as He spoke to
Moses through the medium of the burning bush ([Kor.
20.8-14](../pick/020.htm#020_009).md).

The last explanation, which converts *Ana ’l-Haqq* into an impersonal
monistic axiom, is accepted by most Sufis as representing the true
Hallajian teaching. In a magnificent ode Jalaluddin Rumi describes how
the One Light shines in myriad forms through the whole universe, and how

<span id="153"><span class="small">{p. 153}</span></span>

the One Essence, remaining ever the same, clothes itself from age to age
in the prophets and saints who are its witnesses to mankind.

      "Every moment the robber Beauty rises in a different shape,
        ravishes the soul, and disappears.
      Every instant that Loved One assumes a new garment, now of eld,
        now of youth.
      Now He plunged into the heart of the substance of the potter's
        clay--the Spirit plunged, like a diver.
      Anon He rose from the depths of mud that is moulded and baked,
        then He appeared in the world.
      He became Noah, and at His prayer the world was flooded while
        He went into the Ark.
      He became Abraham and appeared in the midst of the fire, which
        turned to roses for His sake.
      For a while He was roaming on the earth to pleasure Himself,
      Then He became Jesus and ascended to the dome of Heaven and began
        to glorify God.
      In brief, it was He that was coming and going in every generation
        thou hast seen,
      Until at last He appeared in the form of an Arab and gained the
        empire of the world.
      What is it that is transferred? What is transmigration in reality?
        The lovely winner of hearts
      Became a sword and appeared in the hand of ‘Ali and became the
        Slayer of the time.
      No! no! for 'twas even He that was crying in human shape, 'Ana
        ’l-Haqq.'
      That one who mounted the scaffold was not Mansur {Hallaj is often
        called Mansur, which is properly the name of his father.}, though
        the foolish imagined it.
      Rumi hath not spoken and will not speak words of infidelity: do not
        disbelieve him!
      Whosoever shows disbelief is an infidel and one of those who have
        been doomed to Hell."

<span id="154"><span class="small">{p. 154}</span></span>

\* \* \*

Although in Western and Central Asia--where the Persian kings were
regarded by their subjects as gods, and where the doctrines of
incarnation, anthropomorphism, and metempsychosis are indigenous--the
idea of the God-man was neither so unfamiliar nor unnatural as to shock
the public conscience very profoundly, Hallaj had formulated that idea
in such a way that no mysticism calling itself Mohammedan could
tolerate, much less adopt it. To assert that the divine and human
natures may be interfused and commingled <span class="small">{*Hulul*
was not understood in this sense by Hallaj (Massignon, *op. cit.*, p.
199), though the verses quoted on [p. 151](#151.md) readily suggest such an
interpretation. Hallaj, I think, would have agreed with Eckhart (who
said, "The word *I am* none can truly speak but God alone") that the
personality in which the Eternal is immanent has itself a part in
eternity (Inge, *Christian Mysticism*, p. 149, note).}</span>, would
have been to deny the principle of unity on which Islam is based. The
subsequent history of Sufism shows how deification was identified with
unification. The antithesis--God, Man--melted away in the pantheistic
theory which has been explained above <span class="small">{see [pp. 79
ff.](#79.md)}</span>. There is no real existence apart from God. Man is an
emanation or a reflexion or a mode of Absolute Being. What he thinks of
as individuality is in truth not-being; it cannot be separated or
united, for it does not exist. Man *is* God, yet with

<span id="155"><span class="small">{p. 155}</span></span>

a difference. According to Ibn al-‘Arabi <span class="small">{Massignon,
*op. cit.*, p. 183.}</span> the eternal and the phenomenal are two
complementary aspects of the One, each of which is necessary to the
other. The creatures are the external manifestation of the Creator, and
Man is God's consciousness (*sirr*) as revealed in creation. But since
Man, owing to the limitations of his mind, cannot think all objects of
thought simultaneously, and therefore expresses only a part of the
divine consciousness, he is not entitled to say *Ana ’l-Haqq*, "I am
God." He is *a* reality, but not *the* Reality. We shall see that other
Sufis--Jalaluddin Rumi, for example--in their ecstatic moments, at any
rate, ignore this rather subtle distinction.

The statement that in realising the non-entity of his individual self
the Sufi realises his essential oneness with God, sums up the Mohammedan
theory of deification in terms with which my readers are now familiar. I
will endeavour to show what more precise meaning may be assigned to it,
partly in my own words and partly by means of illustrative extracts from
various authors.

Several aspects of *fana* have already been distinguished <span
class="small">{See [pp. 60, 61](#60.md).}</span>. The highest of these--the
passing-away in the divine essence--is fully described by Niffari, who
employs instead of *fana* and *fani* (self-naughted) the terms

<span id="156"><span class="small">{p. 156}</span></span>

*waqfat*, signifying cessation from search, and *waqif*, *i.e.* one who
desists from seeking and passes away in the Object Sought. Here are some
of the chief points that occur in the text and commentary.

*Waqfat* is luminous: it expels the dark thoughts of 'otherness,' just
as light banishes darkness; it changes the phenomenal values of all
existent things into their real and eternal values.

Hence the *waqif* transcends time and place. "He enters every house and
it contains him not; he drinks from every well but is not satisfied;
then he reaches Me, and I am his home, and his abode is with Me"--that
is to say, he comprehends all the divine attributes and embraces all
mystical experiences. He is not satisfied with the names (attributes),
but seeks the Named. He contemplates the essence of God and finds it
identical with his own. He does not pray. Prayer is from man to God, but
in *waqfat* there is nothing but God.

The *waqif* leaves not a rack behind him, nor any heir except God. When
even the phenomenon of *waqfat* has disappeared from his consciousness,
he becomes the very Light. Then his praise of God proceeds from God, and
his knowledge is God's knowledge, who beholds Himself alone as He was in
the beginning.

We need not expect to discover how this

<span id="157"><span class="small">{p. 157}</span></span>

essentialisation, substitution, or transmutation is effected. It is the
grand paradox of Sufism--the *Magnum Opus* wrought somehow in created
man by a Being whose nature is eternally devoid of the least taint of
creatureliness. As I have remarked above, the change, however it may be
conceived, does not involve infusion of the divine essence (*hulul*) or
identification of the divine and human natures (*ittihad*). Both these
doctrines are generally condemned. Abu Nasr al-Sarraj criticises them in
two passages of his *Kitab al-Luma‘*, as follows:

> "Some mystics of Baghdad have erred in their doctrine that when they
> pass away from their qualities they enter into the qualities of God.
> This leads to incarnation (*hulul*) or to the Christian belief
> concerning Jesus. The doctrine in question has been attributed to some
> of the ancients, but its true meaning is this, that when a man goes
> forth from his own qualities and enters into the qualities of God, he
> goes forth from his own will and enters into the will of God, knowing
> that his will is given to him by God and that by virtue of this gift
> he is severed from regarding himself, so that he becomes entirely
> devoted to God; and this is one of the stages of Unitarians. Those who
> have erred in this doctrine have failed to

<span id="158"><span class="small">{p. 158}</span></span>

> observe that the qualities of God are not God. To make God identical
> with His qualities is to be guilty of infidelity, because God does not
> descend into the heart, but that which descends into the heart is
> faith in God and belief in His unity and reverence for the thought of
> Him."

In the second passage he makes use of a similar argument in order to
refute the doctrine of *ittihad*.

> "Some have abstained from food and drink, fancying that when a man's
> body is weakened it is possible that he may lose his humanity and be
> invested with the attributes of divinity. The ignorant persons who
> hold this erroneous doctrine cannot distinguish between humanity and
> the inborn qualities of humanity. Humanity does not depart from man
> any more than blackness departs from that which is black or whiteness
> from that which is white, but the inborn qualities of humanity are
> changed and transmuted by the all-powerful radiance that is shed upon
> them from the divine Realities. The attributes of humanity are not the
> essence of humanity. Those who inculcate the doctrine of *fana* mean
> the passing-away of regarding one's own actions and works of devotion
> through

<span id="159"><span class="small">{p. 159}</span></span>

> the continuance of regarding God as the doer of these actions on
> behalf of His servant."

Hujwiri characterises as absurd the belief that passing-away (*fana*)
signifies loss of essence and destruction of corporeal substance, and
that 'abiding' (*baqa*) indicates the indwelling of God in man. Real
passing-away from anything, he says, implies consciousness of its
imperfection and absence of desire for it. Whoever passes away from his
own perishable will abides in the everlasting will of God, but human
attributes cannot become divine attributes or vice versa.

> "The power of fire transforms to its own quality anything that falls
> into it, and surely the power of God's will is greater than that of
> fire; yet fire affects only the quality of iron without changing its
> substance, for iron can never become fire."

In another part of his work Hujwiri defines 'union' (*jam‘*) as
concentration of thought upon the desired object. Thus Majnun, the
Orlando Furioso of Islam, concentrated his thoughts on Layla, so that he
saw only her in the whole world, and all created things assumed the form
of Layla in his eyes. Some one came to the cell of Bayazid and asked,
"Is Bayazid here?" He answered, "Is any one here but God?"

<span id="160"><span class="small">{p. 160}</span></span>

The principle in all such cases, Hujwiri adds, is the same, namely:

> "That God divides the one substance of His love and bestows a particle
> thereof, as a peculiar gift, upon every one of His friends in
> proportion to their enravishment with Him; then he lets down upon that
> particle the shrouds of fleshliness and human nature and temperament
> and spirit, in order that by its powerful working it may transmute to
> its own quality all the particles that are attached to it, until the
> lover's clay is wholly converted into love and all his acts and looks
> become so many properties of love. This state is named 'union' alike
> by those who regard the inward sense and the outward expression."

Then he quotes these verses of Hallaj:

> "Thy will be done. O my Lord and Master! Thy will be done, O my
> purpose and meaning! O essence of my being, O goal of my desire, O my
> speech and my hints and my gestures! O all of my all, O my hearing and
> my sight, O my whole and my element and my particles!"

The enraptured Sufi who has passed beyond the illusion of subject and
object and broken through to the Oneness can either deny that he is
anything or affirm that he is all things. As an example of 'the negative
way,' take the opening lines of an ode by

<span id="161"><span class="small">{p. 161}</span></span>

Jalaluddin which I have rendered into verse, imitating the metrical form
of the Persian as closely as the genius of our language will permit:

      "Lo, for I to myself am unknown, now in God's name what must I do?
      I adore not the Cross nor the Crescent, I am not a Giaour nor a Jew.
      East nor West, land nor sea is my home, I have kin nor with angel
        nor gnome,
      I am wrought not of fire nor of foam, I am shaped not of dust nor
        of dew.
      I was born not in China afar, not in Saqsin and not in Bulghar;
      Not in India, where five rivers are, nor ‘Iraq nor Khorasan I grew.
      Not in this world nor that world I dwell, not in Paradise, neither
        in Hell;
      Not from Eden and Rizwan I fell, not from Adam my lineage I drew.
      In a place beyond uttermost Place, in a tract without shadow of trace,
      Soul and body transcending I live in the soul of my Loved One anew!"

The following poem, also by Jalaluddin, expresses the positive aspect of
the cosmic consciousness:

      "If there be any lover in the world, O Moslems, 'tis I.
      If there be any believer, infidel, or Christian hermit, 'tis I.
      The wine-dregs, the cupbearer, the minstrel, the harp, and the music,
      The beloved, the candle, the drink and the joy of the drunken--'tis I.
      The two-and-seventy creeds and sects in the world

<span id="162"><span class="small">{p. 162}</span></span>

      Do not really exist: I swear by God that every creed and sect--'tis I.
      Earth and air and water and fire--knowest thou what they are?
      Earth and air and water and fire, nay, body and soul too--'tis I.
      Truth and falsehood, good and evil, ease and difficulty from first
        to last,
      Knowledge and learning and asceticism and piety and faith--'tis I.
      The fire of Hell, be assured, with its flaming limbos,
      Yes, and Paradise and Eden and the Houris--'tis I.
      This earth and heaven with all that they hold,
      Angels, Peris, Genies, and Mankind--'tis I."

What Jalaluddin utters in a moment of ecstatic vision Henry More
describes as a past experience:

> "How lovely" (he says), "how magnificent a state is the soul of man
> in, when the life of God inactuating her shoots her along with Himself
> through heaven and earth; makes her unite with, and after a sort feel
> herself animate, the whole world. He that is here looks upon all
> things as One, and on himself, if he can then mind himself, as a part
> of the Whole."

For some Sufis, absorption in the ecstasy of *fana* is the end of their
pilgrimage. Thenceforth no relation exists between them and the world.
Nothing of themselves is left in them; as individuals, they are dead.
Immersed in Unity, they know neither law nor religion nor any form of
phenomenal

<span id="163"><span class="small">{p. 163}</span></span>

being. But those God-intoxicated devotees who never return to sobriety
have fallen short of the highest perfection. The full circle of
deification must comprehend both the inward and outward aspects of
Deity--the One and the Many, the Truth and the Law. It is not enough to
escape from all that is creaturely, without entering into the eternal
life of God the Creator as manifested in His works. To abide in God
(*baqa*) after having passed-away from selfhood (*fana*) is the mark of
the Perfect Man, who not only journeys *to* God, *i.e.* passes from
plurality to unity, but *in* and *with* God, *i.e.* continuing in the
unitive state, he returns with God to the phenomenal world from which he
set out, and manifests unity in plurality. In this descent

      "He makes the Law his upper garment
      And the mystic Path his inner garment,"

for he brings down and displays the Truth to mankind while fulfilling
the duties of the religious law. Of him it may be said, in the words of
a great Christian mystic:

> "He goes *towards* God by inward love, in eternal work, and he goes in
> God by his fruitive inclination, in eternal rest. And he dwells in
> God; and yet he goes out towards created things in a spirit of love
> towards all things, in the virtues and in works of

<span id="164"><span class="small">{p. 164}</span></span>

> righteousness. And this is the most exalted summit of the inner life."
> <span class="small">{Ruysbroeck, quoted in E. Underhill's
> *Introduction to Mysticism*, p. 522.}</span>

‘Afifuddin Tilimsani, in his commentary on Niffari, describes four
mystical journeys:

The *first* begins with gnosis and ends with complete passing-away
(*fana*).

The *second* begins at the moment when passing-away is succeeded by
'abiding' (*baqa*).

He who has attained to this station journeys in the Real, by the Real,
to the Real, and he then is a reality (*haqq*) <span class="small">{See
[p. 155](#155.md) above.}</span>. Thus travelling onward, he arrives at the
station of the *Qutb* <span class="small">{See [p. 123](#123.md).}</span>,
which is the station of Perfect Manhood. He becomes the centre of the
spiritual universe, so that every point and limit reached by individual
human beings is equally distant from his station, whether they be near
or far; since all stations revolve round his, and in relation to the
*Qutb* there is no difference between nearness and farness. To one who
has gained this supreme position, knowledge and gnosis and passing-away
are as rivers of his ocean, whereby he replenishes whomsoever he will.
He has the right to guide others to God, and seeks permission to do so
from none but himself. Before the gate of Apostleship was closed <span
class="small">{*I.e.* before the time of Mohammed, who is the Seal of
the Prophets.}</span>, he would

<span id="165"><span class="small">{p. 165}</span></span>

have deserved the title of Apostle, but in our day his due title is
Director of Souls, and he is a blessing to those who invoke his aid,
because he comprehends the innate capacities of all mankind and, like a
camel-driver, speeds everyone to his home.

In the *third* journey this Perfect Man turns his attention to God's
creatures, either as an Apostle or as a Spiritual Director (Sheykh), and
reveals himself to those who would fain be released from their
faculties, to each according to his degree: to the adherent of positive
religion as a theologian; to the contemplative, who has not yet enjoyed
full contemplation, as a gnostic; to the gnostic as one who has entirely
passed-away from individuality (*waqif*); to the *waqif* as a *Qutb*. He
is the horizon of every mystical station and transcends the furthest
range of experience known to each grade of seekers.

The *fourth* journey is usually associated with physical death. The
Prophet was referring to it when he cried on his deathbed, "I choose the
highest companions." In this journey, to judge from the obscure verses
in which ‘Afifuddin describes it, the Perfect Man, having been invested
with all the divine attributes, becomes, so to speak, the mirror which
displays God to Himself.

      "When my Beloved appears,
      With what eye do I see Him?

<span id="166"><span class="small">{p. 166}</span></span>

      "With His eye, not with mine,
      For none sees Him except Himself."
      (IBN AL-‘ARABI.)

The light in the soul, the eye by which it sees, and the object of its
vision, all are One.

\* \* \*

We have followed the Sufi in his quest of Reality to a point where
language fails. His progress will seldom be so smooth and unbroken as it
appears in these pages. The proverbial headache after intoxication
supplies a parallel to the periods of intense aridity and acute
suffering that sometimes fill the interval between lower and higher
states of ecstasy. Descriptions of this experience--the Dark Night of
the Soul, as it is called by Christian authors--may be found in almost
any biography of Mohammedan saints. Thus Jami relates in his *Nafahat
al-Uns* that a certain dervish, a disciple of the famous Shihabuddin
Suhrawardi,

> "Was endowed with a great ecstasy in the contemplation of Unity and in
> the station of passing-away (*fana*). One day he began to weep and
> lament. On being asked by the Sheykh Shihabuddin what ailed him, he
> answered, 'Lo, I am debarred by plurality from the vision of Unity. I
> am rejected, and my former state--I cannot find it!' The Sheykh
> remarked that this was the prelude to the station of 'abiding'

<span id="167"><span class="small">{p. 167}</span></span>

> (*baqa*), and that his present state was higher and more sublime than
> the one which he was in before."

Does personality survive in the ultimate union with God? If personality
means a conscious existence distinct, though not separate, from God, the
majority of advanced Moslem mystics say "No!" As the rain-drop absorbed
in the ocean is not annihilated but ceases to exist individually, so the
disembodied soul becomes indistinguishable from the universal Deity. It
is true that when Sufi writers translate mystical union into terms of
love and marriage, they do not, indeed they cannot, expunge the notion
of personality, but such metaphorical phrases are not necessarily
inconsistent with a pantheism which excludes all difference. To be
united, here and now, with the World-Soul is the utmost imaginable bliss
for souls that love each other on earth.

      "Happy the moment when we are seated in the Palace, thou and I,
      With two forms and with two figures but with one soul, thou and I.
      The colours of the grove and the voice of the birds will bestow
        immortality
      At the time when we come into the garden, thou and I.
      The stars of heaven will come to gaze upon us;
      We shall show them the Moon itself, thou and I.
      Thou and I, individuals no more, shall be mingled in ecstasy,
      Joyful and secure from foolish babble, thou and I.

<span id="168"><span class="small">{p. 168}</span></span>

      All the bright-plumed birds of heaven will devour their hearts
        with envy
      In the place where we shall laugh in such a fashion, thou and I.
      This is the greatest wonder, that thou and I, sitting here in
        the same nook,
      Are at this moment both in ‘Iraq and Khorasan, thou and I."
      (JALALUDDIN RUMI.)

Strange as it may seem to our Western egoism, the prospect of sharing in
the general, impersonal immortality of the human soul kindles in the
Sufi an enthusiasm as deep and triumphant as that of the most ardent
believer in a personal life continuing beyond the grave. Jalaluddin,
after describing the evolution of man in the material world and
anticipating his further growth in the spiritual universe, utters a
heartfelt prayer--for what?--for self-annihilation in the ocean of the
Godhead.

      "I died as mineral and became a plant,
      I died as plant and rose to animal,
      I died as animal and I was man.
      Why should I fear? When was I less by dying?
      Yet once more I shall die as man, to soar
      With angels blest; but even from angelhood
      I must pass on: all except God doth perish.
      When I have sacrificed my angel soul,
      I shall become what no mind e'er conceived.
      Oh, let me not exist! for Non-existence
      Proclaims in organ tones, 'To Him we shall return.'"
