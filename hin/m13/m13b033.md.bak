### SECTION LXVIII

"Yudhishthira said, 'Do thou discourse to me once again, O grandsire,
upon the merits attaching to gifts of sesame and of lamps for lighting
darkness, as also of food and robes.'

"Bhishma said, 'In this connection, O Yudhishthira, is recited the
narrative of the discourse that took place in ancient times between a
Brahmana and Yama. In the country lying between the rivers Ganga and
Yamuna, at the foot of the hills called Yamuna, there was a large town
inhabited by Brahmanas. The town was celebrated under the name of
Parnasala and was very delightful in appearance, O king. A large number
of learned Brahmanas lived in it. One day, Yama, the ruler of the dead,
commanded a messenger of his, who was clad in black, endued with
blood-red eyes and hair standing erect, and possessed of feet, eyes, and
nose all of which resembled those of a crow, saying, 'Go thou to the
town inhabited by Brahmanas and bring hither the person known by the
name of Sarmin and belonging by birth to the race of Agastya. He is
intent on mental tranquillity and possessed of learning. He is a
preceptor engaged in teaching the Vedas and his practices are
well-known. Do not bring me

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

another person belonging to the same race and living in the same
neighbourhood. This other man is equal unto him I want, in virtues,
study, and birth. With respect to children and conduct, this other
resembles the intelligent Sarmin. Do thou bring the individual I have in
view. He should be worshipped with [respect](errata.htm#85.md) (instead of
being dragged hither with irreverence).' The messenger having come to
the place, did the very reverse of what he had been bidden to do.
Attacking that person, he brought him who had been forbidden by Yama to
be brought. Possessed of great energy, Yama rose up at the sight of the
Brahmana and worshipped him duly. The king of the dead then commanded
his messenger, saying, 'Let this one be taken back, and let the other
one be brought to me.' When the great judge of the dead said these
words, that Brahmana addressed him and said, 'I have completed my study
of the Vedas and am no longer attached to the world. Whatever period may
yet remain of my mortal existence, I wish to pass, dwelling even here, O
thou of unfading glory! <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md)

"Yama said, 'I cannot ascertain the exact period, ordained by Time, of
one's life, and hence, [unurged](errata.htm#86.md) by Time, I cannot allow
one to take up one's residence here. I take note of the acts of
righteousness (or otherwise) that one does in the world. Do thou, O
learned Brahmana of great splendour return immediately to thy abode. 'I
ell me what also is in thy mind and what I can do for thee, O thou of
unfading glory!'

"The Brahmana said, 'Do thou tell me what those acts are by
accomplishing which one may earn great merit. O best of all beings, thou
art the foremost of authorities (on the subject) even in the three
worlds.'

"Yama said, 'Do thou hear, O regenerate Rishi, the excellent ordinances
regarding gifts. The gift of sesame seeds is a very superior one. It
produces everlasting merit. O [foremost](errata.htm#87.md) of regenerate
ones, one should make gifts of as much sesame as one can. By making
gifts of sesame every day, one is sure to attain the fruition of one's
every wish. The gift of sesame at Sraddhas is applauded. Verily the gift
of sesame is a very superior one. Do thou make gifts of sesame unto the
Brahmanas according to the rites ordained in the scriptures. One should
on the day of the full moon of the month of Vaisakha, make gilts of
sesame unto the Brahmanas. They should also be made to eat and to touch
sesame on every occasion that one can afford. They that are desirous of
achieving what is beneficial to them should, with their whole souls, do
this in their houses. <span id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_82.md) Without doubt,
men should similarly make gifts of water and establish resting places
for the distribution of drinking water. <span
id="fr_83"></span>[3](#fn_83.md) One should cause

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

tanks and lakes and wells to be excavated. Such acts are rare in the
world, O best of regenerate persons! Do thou always make gifts of water.
This act is fraught with great merit. O best of regenerate persons, thou
shouldst establish resting places along the roads for the distribution
of water. After one has eaten, the gift unto one should especially be
made of water for drink.'

"Bhishma continued, 'After Yama had said these words unto him, the
messenger who had borne him from his abode conveyed him back to it. The
Brahmana, on his return, obeyed the instructions he had received. Having
thus conveyed him back to his abode the messenger of Yama fetched Sarmin
who had really been sought by Yama. Taking Sarmin unto him, he informed
his master. Possessed of great energy, the judge of the dead worshipped
that righteous Brahmana, and having conversed with him a while dismissed
him for being taken back to his abode. Unto him also Yama gave the same
instructions. Sarmin, too, coming back into the world of men, did all
that Yama had said. Like the gift of water, Yama, from a desire of doing
good to the Pitris, applauds the gift of lamps to light dark places.
Hence, the giver of a lamp for lighting a dark place is regarded as
benefiting the Pitris. Hence, O best of the Bharatas, one should always
give lamps for lighting dark spots. The giving of lamps enhances the
visual power of the deities, the Pitris, and one's own self. <span
id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md) It has been said, O king, that the gift of
gems is a very superior gift. The Brahmana, who, having accepted a gift
of gems, sells the same for performing a sacrifice, incurs no fault. The
Brahmana, who, having accepted a gift of gems makes a gift of them unto
Brahmanas. acquires inexhaustible merit himself and confers
inexhaustible merit upon him from whom he had originally received them.
Conversant with every duty Manu himself has said that he, who, observant
of proper restraints, earns makes a gift of gems unto a Brahmana
observant of proper restraints earns inexhaustible merit himself and
confers inexhaustible merit upon the recipient. The man who is content
with his own wedded wife and who makes a gift of robes, earns an
excellent complexion and excellent vestments for himself. I have told
thee, O foremost of men, what the merits are that attach to gifts of
kine, of gold, and the sesame agreeably to deserve precepts of the Vedas
and the scriptures One should marry and raise offspring upon one's
wedded wives. Of all acquisitions, O son of Kuru's race, that of male
issue is regarded as the foremost.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_81"></span>[86:1](m13b033.htm#fr_81.md) The first line of 13
and the last line of 14 are very terse: *Kalasya vihitam*, as explained
by the Commentator, is *ayuh pramanam*, *na prapnami* is *na janami*.
The sense is that 'unurged by rime, I cannot allow these to take up my
residence here.'

<span id="fn_82"></span>[86:2](m13b033.htm#fr_82.md) *i.e.*, invite
Brahmanas to feasts in which sesame should predominate.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[86:3](m13b033.htm#fr_83.md) In Bengal, to this
day, those who can afford, particularly pious ladies, establish shady
resting places in the month of Vaisakha (the hottest month of the year),
by the side of the public roads, for travellers, where good cool
drinking water, a handfull of well-drenched oats, and a little of raw
sugar, are freely distributed. Such institutions, on the old Benares
Road and the Grand Trunk Road, considerably refresh travellers. There
are miles upon miles along these roads where good water is not at all
procurable.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[87:1](m13b033.htm#fr_84.md) What is meant by the
giving of lamps is the placing of lighted lamps in dark places which are
the resorts of men, such as roads and ghats, etc.
