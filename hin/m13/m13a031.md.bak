### SECTION XXXI

"Yudhishthira said, 'What men, O chief of Bharata's race, are worthy of
reverent homage in the three worlds? Tell me this in detail verily. I am
never satiated with hearing thee discourse on these topics.'

"Bhishma said, 'In this connection is cited the old narrative of the
discourse between Narada and Vasudeva. Beholding Narada on one occasion
worshipping many foremost of Brahmanas with joined hands, Kesava
addressed him saying, Whom dost thou worship? Whom amongst these

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Brahmanas, O holy one dost thou worship with so
great reverence? If it is a matter that I can heard of, I then wish to
hear it. Do, O foremost of righteous men, tell me this!' <span
id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_250.md)

"Narada said, 'Hear, O Govinda, as to who those are whom I am
worshipping, O grinder of foes. Who else is there in this world that so
much deserves to hear this? I worship the Brahmanas, O puissant one, who
constantly worship Varuna and Vayu and Aditya and Parjanya and the deity
of Fire, and Sthanu and Skanda and Lakshmi and Vishnu and the Brahmanas,
and the lord of speech, and Chandramas, and the Waters and Earth and the
goddess Saraswati. O tiger of Vrishni's race, I always worship those
Brahmanas that are endued with penances, that are conversant with the
Vedas, that are always devoted to Vedic study, and that are possessed of
high worth. O puissant one, I bow down my head unto those persons who
are freed from boastfulness, who discharge, with an empty stomach, the
rites in honour of the deities, who are always contented with what they
have and who are endued with forgiveness. I worship them, O Yadava, that
are performers of sacrifices, that are of a forgiving disposition, and
self restrained, that are masters of their own senses, that worship
truth and righteousness, and that give away land and kine unto good
Brahmanas. <span id="fr_251"></span>[2](#fn_251.md) I bow unto them, O
Yadava, that are devoted to the observance of penances, that dwell in
forests, that subsist upon fruits and roots, that never store anything
for the morrow, and that are observant of all the acts and rites laid
down in the scriptures. I bow unto them, O Yadava, that feed and cherish
their servants, that are always hospitable to guests, and that eat only
the remnants of what is offered to the deities. I worship them that have
become irresistible by studying the Vedas, that are eloquent in
discoursing on the scriptures, that are observant of the vow of
Brahmacharyya, and that are always devoted to the duties of officiating
at the sacrifices of others and of teaching disciples. I worship them
that are endued with compassion towards all creatures, and that study
the Vedas till noon (*i.e.* till their backs are heated by the sun). I
bow unto them, O Yadava, that strive to obtain the grace of their
preceptors, that labour in the acquisition of their Vedas, that are firm
in the observance of vows, that wait, with dutiful obedience, upon their
preceptors and seniors, and that are free from malice and envy. I bow
unto them, O Yadava, that are observant of excellent vows, that practice
taciturnity, that have knowledge of Brahman, that are firm in truth,
that are givers of libations of clarified butter and oblations of meat.
I bow to them, O Yadava, that subsist upon eleemosynary alms, that are
emaciated for want of adequate food and drink, that have lived in the
abodes of their preceptors, that are averse to and destitute of all
enjoyments, and that are poor in the goods of this Earth. I bow unto

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

them, O Yadava, that have no affection for things of this Earth, that
have no quarrels to wage with others, that do not clothe themselves,
that have no wants, that have become [irresistible](errata.htm#29.md)
through the acquisition of the Vedas, that are eloquent in the
exposition of righteousness, and that are utterers of Brahma, I bow unto
them that are devoted to the practice of the duty of compassion towards
all creatures, that are firm in the observance of truth, that are
self-restrained, and that are peaceful in their behaviour. I bow unto
them, O Yadava, that are devoted to the worship of deities and guests,
that are observant of the domestic mode of life, and that follow the
practice of pigeons in the matter of their subsistence. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_252.md) I always bow unto those persons whose
aggregate of three exists, without being weakened, in all their acts,
and who are observant of truth and righteous behaviour, <span
id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_253.md) I bow unto them, O Kesava, that are
conversant with Brahma, that are endued with knowledge of the Vedas,
that are attentive to the aggregate of three, that are free from
cupidity, and that are righteous in their behaviour. I bow unto them, O
Madhava, that subsist upon water only, or upon air alone, or upon the
remnants of the food that is offered to deities and guests, and that are
observant of diverse kinds of excellent vows. I always worship them that
have no spouses (in consequence of the vow of [celibacy](errata.htm#30.md)
they observe), that have spouses and the domestic fire (in consequence
of the domestic mode of life they lead), that are the refuge of the
Vedas, and that are the refuge of all creatures in the universe (in
consequence of the compassion they feel towards them). I always bow unto
those Rishis, O Krishna, that are the creators of the universe, that are
the elders of the universe, that are the eldest members of the race or
the family, that are dispellers of the darkness of ignorance, and that
are the best of all persons in the universe (for righteousness of
behaviour and knowledge of the scriptures). For these reasons, do thou
also, O scion of Vrishni's race, worship every day those regenerate
persons of whom I speak. Deserving as they are of reverent worship, they
will when worshipped, confer happiness on thee, O sinless one. Those
persons of whom I speak are always givers of happiness in this world as
well as in the next. Reverenced by all, they move about in this world,
and if worshipped by thee are sure to grant thee happiness. They who are
hospitable to all persons that come unto them as guests, and who are
always devoted to Brahmanas and kine, as also to truth (in speech and
behaviour), succeed in crossing all calamities and obstacles. They who
are always devoted to peacefulness of behaviour, as also they who are
freed from malice and envy, and they who are always attentive to the
study of the Vedas, succeed in

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

crossing all calamities and obstacles. They who bow unto all the deities
(without showing a preference for any and thereby proving their
tolerance), they who betake themselves to one Veda as their refuge, they
who are possessed of faith and are self-restrained, succeed in crossing
all calamities and obstacles. They who worship the foremost of Brahmanas
with reverence and are firm in the observance of excellent vows and
practise the virtue of charity, succeed in crossing all calamities and
obstacles. They who are engaged in the practice of penances, they who
are always observant of the vow of [celibacy](errata.htm#31.md), and they
whose souls have been cleansed by penances, succeed in crossing all
calamities and obstacles. They who are devoted to the worship of the
deities and guests and dependants, as also of the Pitris, and they who
eat the remnant of the food that is offered to deities, Pitris, guests
and dependants, succeed in crossing all calamities and obstacles. They
who, having ignited the domestic fire, duly keep it burning and worship
it with reverence and they who have duly poured libations (to the
deities) in Soma-sacrifices, succeed in crossing all calamities and
obstacles. They who behave as they should towards their mothers and
fathers and preceptors and other seniors even as thou, O tiger among the
Vrishnis, dost behave, succeed in crossing all calamities and
obstacles--Having said these words, the celestial Rishi ceased
speaking.'

"Bhishma continued. 'For these reasons, do thou also, O son of Kunti,
always worship with reverence the deities, the Pitris, the Brahmanas,
and guests arrived at thy mansion and as the consequence of such conduct
thou art sure to attain to a desirable end!'"

vows, the picking up of scattered and cast off grains from the field
after the crops have been taken away by the owners, is recommended as
the means of filling the stomach.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[152:2](m13a031.htm#fr_253.md) The aggregate of

aggregate of three existing in all their acts.
