### SECTION XLV

"Yudhishthira said, 'If a person, after having given dowry for a maiden,
goes away, how should the maiden's father or other kinsmen who are
competent to bestow her, act? Do tell me this, O grandsire!'

"Bhishma said, 'Such a maiden, if she happens to be the daughter of a
sonless and rich father, should be maintained by the father (in view of
the return of him who has given the dowry). Indeed, if the father does
not return the dowry unto the kinsmen of the giver, the maiden should be
regarded as belonging to the giver of the dowry. She may even raise
offspring for the giver (during his absence) by any of those means that
are laid down in the scriptures. No person, however, can be competent to
wed her according to due rites. Commanded by her sire, the princess
Savitri had in days of old chosen a husband and united herself with him.
This act of hers is applauded by some; but others conversant with the
scriptures, condemn it. Others that are righteous have not acted in this
way. Others hold that the conduct of the righteous should ever be
regarded as

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

the foremost evidence of duty or morality. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) Upon this subject Sukratu, the grandson of
the high-souled Janaka, the ruler of the Videhas, has declared the
following opinion. There is the well-known declaration of the scriptures
that women are incompetent to enjoy freedom at any period of their life.
If this were not the path trodden by the righteous, how could this
scriptural declaration exist? As regards the righteous, therefore, how
can there be any question or doubt in respect of this matter? How can
people condemn that declaration by choosing to conduct themselves
otherwise? The unrighteous dereliction of eternal usage is regarded as
the practice of the Asuras. Such practice we never hear of in the
conduct of the ancients <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md) the
relationship of husband and wife is very subtile (having reference to
the acquisition of destiny, and, therefore, capable of being understood
with the aid of only the inspired declarations in scriptures). It is
different from the natural relationship of male and female which
consists only in the desire for sexual pleasure. This also was said by
the king alluded to of Janaka's race.' <span
id="fr_24"></span>[3](#fn_24.md)

"Yudhishthira said, 'Upon what authority is the wealth of men inherited
(by others when they happen to have daughters)? In respect of her sire
the daughter should be regarded the same as the son.'

"Bhishma said, 'The son is even as one's own self, and the daughter is
like unto the son. How, therefore, can another take the wealth when one
lives in one's own self in the form of one's daughter? Whatever wealth
is termed the Yautuka property of the mother, forms the portion of the
maiden daughter. If the maternal grandfather happens to die without
leaving sons, the daughter's son should inherit it. The daughter's son
offers pindas to his own father and the father of his mother. Hence, in
accordance with considerations of justice, there is no difference
between the son and the daughter's son. When a person has got only a
daughter and she has been invested by him with the status of a son, if
he then happens to have a son, such a son (instead of taking all the
wealth of his sire) shares the inheritance with the daughter. <span
id="fr_25"></span>[4](#fn_25.md) When, again, a person has got a daughter
and she has been invested by him with the status of a son, if he then
happens to take a son by adoption or purchase then the daughter is held
to be superior to such a son (for she takes three shares of her father's
wealth, the son's share being limited to only the remaining two). In the

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

following case I do not see any reason why the status of a daughter's
son should attach to the sons of one's daughter. The case is that of the
daughter who has been sold by her sire. The sons born of a daughter that
has been sold by her sire for actual price, belong exclusively to their
father (even if he do not beget them himself but obtain them according
to the rules laid down in the scriptures for the raising of issue
through the agency of others). Such sons can never belong, even as
daughter's sons, to their maternal grandfather in consequence of his
having sold their mother for a price and lost all his rights in or to
her by that act. <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) Such sons, again,
become full of malice, unrighteous in conduct, the misappropriators of
other people's wealth, and endued with deceit and cunning. Having sprung
from that sinful form of marriage called Asura, the issue becomes wicked
in conduct. Persons acquainted with the histories of olden times,
conversant with duties, devoted to the scriptures and firm in
maintaining the restraints therein laid down, recite in this connection
some metrical lines sung in days of yore by Yama. Even this is what Yama
had sung. That man who acquires wealth by selling his own son, or who
bestows his daughter after accepting a dower for his own livelihood, has
to sink in seven terrible hells one after another, known by the name of
Kalasutra. There that wretch has to feed upon sweat and urine and stools
during the whole time. In that form of marriage which is called Arsha,
the person who weds has to give a bull and a cow and the father of the
maiden accepts the gift. Some characterise this gift as a dowry (or
price), while some are of opinion that it should not be regarded in that
light. The true opinion, however, is that a gift for such a purpose, be
it of small value or large, should, O king, be regarded as dowry or
price, and the bestowal of the daughter under such circumstances should
be viewed as a sale. Notwithstanding the fact of its having been
practised by a few persons it can never be taken as the eternal usage.
Other forms of marriage are seen, practised by men, such as marrying
girls after abducting them by force from amidst their kinsmen. Those
persons who have sexual intercourse with a maiden, after reducing her to
subjection by force, are regarded as perpetrators of sin. They have to
sink in darkest hell. <span id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27.md) Even a human
being with whom one has no relationship of blood should not form the
subject of sale. What need then be said of one's own issue? With the
wealth that is acquired by doing sinful deeds, no action leading to
merit can be performed.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_22"></span>[23:1](m13b010.htm#fr_22.md) Hence, what Savitri
did at the bidding of her sire could not be against the course of duty
or morality. The Burdwan translator has misunderstood the second line of
this verse, while K.P. Singha has quietly dropped it.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[23:2](m13b010.htm#fr_23.md) *Dharmasya* refers to
the true or correct or eternal Aryan usage, *Pradanam* is *khandanam*,
from *da*, to cut The sense is that the grant of liberty to women is an
*Asura* practice.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[23:3](m13b010.htm#fr_24.md) Hence, no one should
wed, led by desire alone. Nor should the maiden be permitted to choose
for herself. She may be guided in her choice by improper considerations
connected with only carnal pleasure.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[23:4](m13b010.htm#fr_25.md) The property is
divided into five parts, two of which are taken by the daughter under
such circumstances and three by the son.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[24:1](m13b010.htm#fr_26.md) I expand the verse for
making it intelligible, by setting forth the reasons urged by Hindu
lawyers and noticed by the commentator.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[24:2](m13b010.htm#fr_27.md) *Valatah vasyam*
implies only those whose consent is obtained by force. Hence, such cases
as those of Krishna abducting Rukmini and Arjuna abducting Subhadra, are
excluded from this denunciation.
