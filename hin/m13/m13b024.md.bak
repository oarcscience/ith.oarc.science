### SECTION LIX

"Yudhishthira said, 'Amongst all those gifts that are mentioned in the
treatises other than the Vedas, which gift, O chief of Kuru's race, is
the most distinguished in thy opinion? O puissant one, great is the
curiosity I feel with respect to this matter. Do thou discourse to me
also of that gift which follows the giver into the next world.' <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md)

"Bhishma said, 'An assurance unto all creatures of love and affection
and abstention from every kind of injury, acts of kindness and favour
done to a person in distress, gifts of articles made unto one that
solicits with thirst and agreeable to the solicitor's wishes, and
whatever gifts are made without the giver's ever thinking of them as
gifts made by him, constitute, O chief of Bharata's race, the highest
and best of gifts. Gift of gold, gift of kine, and gift of earth,--these
are regarded as sin-cleansing. They rescue the giver from his evil acts.
O chief of men, do thou always

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

make such gifts unto those that are righteous. Without doubt, gifts
rescue the giver from all his sins. That person who wishes to make his
gifts eternal should always give unto persons possessed of the requisite
qualifications whatever articles are desired by all and whatever things
are the best in his house. The man who makes gifts of agreeable things
and who does to others what is agreeable to others, always succeeds in
obtaining things that are agreeable to himself. Such a person certainly
becomes agreeable unto all, both here and hereafter. That man, O
Yudhishthira, is a cruel wretch, who, through vanity, does not, to the
extent of his means, attend to the wishes of one who is poor and
helpless, and who solicits assistance. <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md) He is verily the foremost of men who shows
favour unto even an helpless enemy fallen into distress when such enemy
presents himself and prays for help. No man is equal to him (in merit)
who satisfies the hunger of a person that is emaciated, possessed of
learning, destitute of the means of support, and weakened by misery. One
should always, O son of Kunti, dispel by every means in one's power, the
distress of righteous persons observant of vows and acts, who, though
destitute of sons and spouses and plunged into misery, do not yet
solicit others for any kind of assistance. Those persons who do not
utter blessings upon the deities and men (in expectation of gifts), who
are deserving of reverence and always contented, and who subsist upon
such alms as they get without solicitation of any kind, are regarded as
veritable snakes of virulent poison. Do thou, O Bharata, always protect
thyself from them by making gifts unto them. They are competent to make
the foremost of Ritwikas. Thou art to find them out by means of thy
spies and agents. <span id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54.md) Thou shouldst
honour those men by gifts of good houses equipped with every necessary
article, with slaves and serving men, with good robes and vestments, O
son of Kuru, and with all articles competent to contribute to one's
pleasure and happiness. Righteous men of righteous deeds should make
such gifts, impelled by the motive that it is their duty to act in that
way and not from desire of reaping any rewards therefrom. Verily good
men should act in this way so that the virtuous men described above
might not, O Yudhishthira, feel any disinclination to accept those gifts
sanctified by devotion and faith. There are persons bathed in learning
and bathed in vows. Without depending upon anybody they obtain their
means of subsistence. These Brahmanas of rigid vows are devoted to Vedic
study and penances without proclaiming their practices to any one.
Whatever gifts thus mayst make unto those persons of pure behaviour, of
thorough mastery over their senses, and always contented with their own
wedded spouses in the matter of desire, are sure to win for thee a merit
that will accompany thee into all the worlds into which thou mayst go.
One reaps the same merit by making gifts unto regenerate persons of

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

restrained souls which one wins by properly pouring libations unto the
sacred fire morning and evening. Even this is the sacrifice spread out
for thee,--a sacrifice that is sanctified by devotion and faith and that
is endued with Dakshina. It is distinguished above all other sacrifices.
Let that sacrifice ceaselessly flow from thee as thou givest away. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md) Performed in view of such men, O
Yudhishthira, a sacrifice in which the water that is sprinkled for
dedicating gifts constitutes the oblations in honour of the Pitris, and
devotion and worship rendered unto such superior men, serves to free one
of the debts one owes to the deities. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[2](#fn_56.md) Those persons that do not yield to wrath
and that never desire to take even a blade of grass belonging to others,
as also they that are of agreeable speech, deserve to receive from us
the most reverent worship. Such persons and others (because free from
desire) never pay their regards to the giver. Nor do they strive for
obtaining gifts. They should, however, be cherished by givers as they
cherish their own sons. I bend my head unto them. From them also both
Heaven and Hell may become one's. <span id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57.md)
Ritwiks and Purohitas and preceptors, when conversant with the Vedas and
when behaving mildly towards disciples, become such. Without doubt,
Kshatriya energy loses its force upon a Brahmana when it encounters him.
Thinking that thou art a king, that thou art possessed of great power,
and that thou hast affluence, do not, O Yudhishthira, enjoy thy
affluence without giving anything unto the Brahmanas. Observing the
duties of thy own order, do thou worship the Brahmanas with whatever
wealth thou hast, O sinless one, for purposes of adornment or sustaining
thy power. Let the Brahmanas live in whatever way they like. Thou
shouldst always bend thy head unto them with reverence. Let them always
rejoice in thee as thy children, living happily and according to their
wishes. Who else than thou, O best of the Kurus, is competent to provide
the means of subsistence for such Brahmanas as are endued with eternal
contentment as are thy well-wishers, and as are gratified by only a
little? As women have one eternal duty, in this world, *viz*.,
dependence upon and obedient service to their husbands, and as such duty
constitutes their only end, even so is the service to Brahmanas Our
eternal duty and end. If, at sight of cruelties and other sinful acts in
Kshatriyas, the Brahmanas, O son, unhonoured by us, forsake us all, I
say, of what use would life be to us, in the absence of all

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

contact with the Brahmanas, especially as we shall then have to drag on
our existence without being able to study the Vedas to perform
sacrifices, to hope for worlds of bliss hereafter, and to achieve great
feats? I shall, in this connection, tell thee what the eternal usage is.
In days of yore, O king, the Kshatriyas used to serve the Brahmanas. The
Vaisya in a similar manner used in those days to worship the royal
order, and the Sudra to worship the Vaisya. Even this is what is heard.
The Brahmana was like a blazing fire. Without being able to touch him or
approach his presence, the Sudra used to serve the Brahmana from a
distance. It was only the Kshatriya and the Vaisya who could serve the
Brahmana by touching his person or approaching his presence. The
Brahmanas are endued with a mild disposition. They are truthful in
behaviour. They are followers of the true religion. When angry, they are
like snakes of virulent poison. Such being their nature, do thou, O
Yudhishthira, serve and attend upon them with obedience and reverence.
The Brahmanas are superior to even those that are higher than the high
and the low. The energy and penances of even those Kshatriyas who blaze
forth with energy and might, become powerless and neutralised when they
come in contact with the Brahmanas. My sire himself is not dearer to me
than the Brahmanas. My mother is not dearer to me than they. My
grandsire, O king, is not dearer, my own self is not dearer, my life
itself is not dearer, O king, to me than the Brahmanas! On earth there
is nothing, O Yudhishthira, that is dearer to me than thou. But, O chief
of Bharata's race, the Brahmanas are dearer to me than even thou. I tell
thee truly, O son of Pandu! I swear by this truth, by which I hope to
acquire all those regions of bliss that have been Santanu's. I behold
those sacred regions with Brahma shining conspicuously before them. I
shall repair thither, O son, and reside in them for unending days.
Beholding these regions, O best of the Bharatas (with my spiritual
eyes), I am filled with delight at the thought of all these acts which I
have done in aid and honour of the Brahmanas, O monarch!'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_52"></span>[60:1](m13b024.htm#fr_52.md) The commentator
explains that the drift of Yudhishthira's query is this: the giver and
the receiver do not meet in the next world. How then can an object given
away return or find its way back to the giver in the next world or next
life?

<span id="fn_53"></span>[61:1](m13b024.htm#fr_53.md) *Abhimanat* is
differently understood by the commentator.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[61:2](m13b024.htm#fr_54.md) *Yuktaih* is the
better reading, although *muktaih* may not be erroneous. *Yuktain* is
*charaih*; while *muktath* is 'men charged with a commission to do a
thing'.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[62:1](m13b024.htm#fr_55.md) This sacrifice is the
sacrifices of gifts. 'Spreading out a sacrifice' means 'spreading out
the articles and placing them in proper order in view of the sacrifice.'
'*Dadatah vartotam*' means *datustaya saryanastu*.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[62:2](m13b024.htm#fr_56.md) The sense is this:
gifts made to such superior Brahmanas serve to free a person from the
debts which he owes to the deities. The 'water of gifts' means the water
that the giver sprinkles, with a blade of Kusa grass, over the article
given away, saying, 'I give this away'. In the sacrifice constituted by
gifts, such water is like the dedication of offerings to the Pitris. A
knowledge of the ritual of sacrifice is needed to understand and
appreciate the figures employed in such verses.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[62:3](m13b024.htm#fr_57.md) Some texts read
*tathabham*, meaning *abhayam* or fearlessness is from
them--*Tathobhayam* (which I adopt) is that both, Heaven and Hell become
one's through them if gratified, they bestow Heaven; if angry, they hurl
into Hell.
