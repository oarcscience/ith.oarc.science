### SECTION XXII

"Yudhishthira said, 'Whom do the eternal Brahmanas strictly observing
religious rites call a proper object of gifts? Is a Brahmana that bears
the symbols of the order of life he follows to be regarded as such or
one who does not bear such indications is to be so regarded?' <span
id="fr_201"></span>[1](#fn_201.md)

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

"Bhishma said, 'O monarch, it has been said that gifts should be made
unto a Brahmana that adheres to the duties of his own order, whether, he
bears the indications of a Brahmachari or not, for both are faultless,
*viz*., he that bears such indications and he that is divested of them.'

"Yudhishthira said, 'What fault does an uncleansed person incur, if he
makes gifts of sacrificial butter or food with great devotion unto
persons of the regenerate order?'

"Bhishma said, 'Even one that is most destitute of self-restraint
becomes, without doubt, cleansed by devotion. Such a man, O thou of
great splendour, becomes cleansed in respect of every act (and not with
reference to gift alone).'

"Yudhishthira said, 'It has been said that a Brahmana that is sought to
be employed in an act having reference to the deities, should never be
examined. The learned, however, say that with respect to such acts as
have reference to the Pitris, the Brahmana that is sought to be
employed, should be examined (in the matter of both his conduct and
competence).'

"Bhishma said, 'As regards acts that have reference to the deities,
these fructify not in consequence of the Brahmana that is employed in
doing the rites but through the grace of the deities themselves. Without
doubt, those persons that perform sacrifice obtain the merit attached to
those acts, through the grace of the deities. <span
id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_202.md) The Brahmanas, O chief of the Bharatas,
are always devoted of Brahman. The Rishi Markandeya, one of the greatest
Rishis endued with intelligence in all the worlds, said this in days of
yore.'

"Yudhishthira said, 'Why, O grandsire, are there five *viz*., he that is
a stranger, he that is endued with learning (connected with the duties
of his order), he that is connected by marriage, he that is endued with
penances, and he that adheres to the performance of sacrifices, regarded
as proper persons?' <span id="fr_203"></span>[2](#fn_203.md)

"Bhishma said, 'The first three, *viz*., strangers, relatives, and
ascetics, when possessed of these attributes, *viz*., purity of birth,
devotion to religious acts, learning, compassion, modesty, sincerity,
and truthfulness, are regarded as proper persons. The other two, *viz*.,
men of learning and those devoted to sacrifices, when endued with five
of these attributes, *viz*., purity of birth, compassion, modesty,
sincerity, truthfulness, are also regarded as proper persons. Listen now
to me, O son of Pritha, as I recite to thee the opinions of these four
persons of mighty energy, *viz*., the goddess Earth, the Rishi Kasyapa,
Agni (the deity of fire) and the ascetic Markandeya.'

"The Earth said, 'As a clod of mud, when thrown into the great ocean
quickly dissolves away, even so every kind of sin disappears in the
three

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

high attributes *viz*., officiation at sacrifices, teaching and
receiving of gifts. <span id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_204.md)

"Kasyapa said, 'The Vedas with their six branches, the Sankhya
philosophy, the Puranas, and high birth, these fail to rescue a
regenerate person if he falls away from good conduct.' <span
id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_205.md)

"Agni said, 'That Brahmana who, engaged in study and regarding himself
learned, seeks with the aid of his learning to destroy the reputation of
others, falls away from righteousness, and comes to be regarded as
dissociated from truth. Verily regions of felicity herein-after are
never attained to by such a person of destructive genius.'

"Markandeya said, 'If a thousand Horse-sacrifices and Truth were weighed
in the balance, I do not know whether the former would weigh even half
as heavy as the latter.'

"Bhishma continued, 'Having spoken these words, those four persons, each
of whom is endued with immeasurable energy, *viz*., the goddess Earth,
Kasyapa, Agni, and Bhrigu's son armed with weapons, quickly went away.'

"Yudhishthira said, 'If Brahmanas observant of the vow of Brahmacharyya
in this world solicit the offerings one makes (unto one's deceased
ancestors in Sraddhas) I ask, can the Sraddha be regarded
well-performed, if the performer actually makes over those offerings
unto such Brahmanas.

"Bhishma said, 'If, having practised the vow of Brahmacharyya for the
prescribed period (of twelve years) and acquired proficiency in the
Vedas and their branches, a Brahmana himself solicits the offering made
in Sraddhas and eats the same, he is regarded to fall away from his vow.
The Sraddha, however, is not regarded as stained in any way.'

"Yudhishthira said, 'The wise have said that duty of righteousness has
many ends and numerous doors. Tell me, O grandsire, what however are the
settled conclusions in this matter.' <span
id="fr_206"></span>[3](#fn_206.md)

Bhishma said, 'Abstention from injury to others, truthfulness, the
absence of wrath (forgiveness), compassion, self-restraint, and
sincerity or candour, O monarch, are the indications of Righteousness.
There are persons who wander over the earth, praising righteousness but
without practising what they preach and engaged all the while in sin. O
king, He who gives unto such persons gold or gems or steeds, has to sink
in hell and to subsist there for ten years, eating the while the faeces
of such persons as live upon the flesh of dead kine and buffalos, of men
called Pukkasas, of others that live in the outskirts of cities and
villages, and of men that publish, under the influence of wrath and
folly, the acts and the ommissions

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

of others. <span id="fr_207"></span>[1](#fn_207.md) Those foolish men who
do give unto a Brahmana observant of the vow of Brahmacharyya the
offerings made in Sraddhas (unto one's deceased ancestors), have to go,
O monarch into regions of great misery.'

"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, what is superior to
Brahmacharyya? What is the highest indication of virtue? What is the
highest kind of purity?'

"Bhishma said,--'I tell thee, O son, that abstention from honey and meat
is even superior to Brahmacharyya. Righteousness consists in keeping
within boundaries or in self-restraint, the best indication of
Righteousness is Renunciation (which is also the highest kind of
purity). <span id="fr_208"></span>[2](#fn_208.md)

"Yudhishthira said, 'In what time should one practise Righteousness? In
what time should wealth be sought? In what time should pleasure be
enjoyed? O grandsire, do tell me this.'

"Bhishma said,--'One should earn wealth in the first part of one's life.
Then should one earn Righteousness, and then enjoy pleasure. One should
not, however, attach oneself to any of these. One should regard the
Brahmanas, worship one's preceptor and seniors, show compassion for all
creatures, be of mild disposition and agreeable speech. To utter
false-hood in a court of justice, to behave deceitfully towards the
king, to act falsely towards preceptors and seniors, are regarded as
equivalent (in heinousness) to Brahmanicide. One should never do an act
of violence to the king's person. Nor should one ever strike a cow. Both
these offences are equivalent to the sin of foeticide. One should never
abandon one's (*homa*) fire. One should also never cast off one's study
of the Vedas. One should never assail a Brahmana by words or acts. All
these offences are equivalent to Brahmanicide.'

"Yudhishthira said,--'What kind of Brahmanas should be regarded as good?
By making presents unto (what kind of) Brahmanas one may acquire great
merit? What kind of Brahmanas are they whom one should feed? Tell me all
this, O grandsire!'

"Bhishma said, 'Those Brahmanas that are freed from wrath, that are
devoted to acts of righteousness, that are firm in Truth, and that
practise

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

self-restraint are regarded as good. By making gifts unto them one
acquires great merit. One wins great merit by making presents unto such
Brahmanas as are free from pride, capable of bearing everything, firm in
the pursuit of their objects, endued with mastery over their senses,
devoted to the good of all creatures, and disposed to be friendly
towards all. One earns great merit by making gifts unto such Brahmanas
as are free from cupidity, as are pure of heart and conduct, possessed
of learning and modesty, truthful in speech and observant of their own
duties as laid down in the scriptures. The Rishis have declared that
Brahmana to be a deserving object of gifts who studies the four Vedas
with all their branches and is devoted to the six well-known duties
(laid down in the scriptures). One acquires great merit by making gifts
unto Brahmanas possessed of such qualifications. The man who makes gifts
[unto](errata.htm#18.md) a deserving Brahmana multiplies his merit a
thousand-fold. A single righteous Brahmana [possessed](errata.htm#19.md) of
wisdom and Vedic lore, observant of the duties laid down in the
scriptures, distinguished by purity of behaviour, is competent to rescue
a whole race. <span id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_209.md) One should make
gifts of kine and horses and wealth and food and other kinds of articles
unto a Brahmana that is possessed of such qualifications. By making such
gifts unto such persons one earns great happiness in the next world. As
I have already told thee even one such Brahmana is fully competent to
rescue the entire race to which the giver belongs. What need I say,
therefore, O dear son, of the merit of making gifts unto many Brahmanas
of such qualifications? In making gifts, therefore one should always
select the object to whom the gifts are to be made. Hearing of a
Brahmana possessed of proper qualifications and regarded with respect by
all good people, one should invite him even if he resides at a distance
and welcome him when he arrives and one should worship him by all means
in his power.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_201"></span>[115:1](m13a022.htm#fr_201.md) *Linga* means signs
or indications. A *Lingin* is one that bears signs and indications.
*Brahmanam* (in both places) means one conversant with Brahman. The
first, that is, *Lingin* implies either a Brahmacharin or a Sanyasin
that always bears the marks of his order. An *Alingin* is one that is
divested of such marks. Yudhishthira's question is, who, amongst these,
should be considered worthy of gifts?

<span id="fn_202"></span>[116:1](m13a022.htm#fr_202.md) The sense is that
with respect to acts having reference to only the Pitris the conduct and
competence of Brahmanas should be examined.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[116:2](m13a022.htm#fr_203.md) The commentator
explains that five persons are mentioned in the question of
Yudhishthira, K. P. Singha omits one. The Burdwan translator repeats the
words of the original without any explanation. I take *sambandhi* to
mean relatives by marriage. To this day, in all India, people make gifts
or presents unto sons-in-law, etc.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[117:1](m13a022.htm#fr_204.md) The sense is that
no sin can touch a Brahmana who observes these three acts. These three
acts are efficacious in washing away all sins. The commentator points
out that by this the attributes of birth and knowledge are referred to.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[117:2](m13a022.htm#fr_205.md) By good conduct is
implied modesty and candour.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[117:3](m13a022.htm#fr_206.md) *Anekantam* is
explained by the commentator as *Anekaphalakaram*, *i.e.*, of diverse
kinds of fruits. The fruits attainable by a correct discharge of duties
are of diverse kinds, because the objects of those duties, called Palms
are of various kinds.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[118:1](m13a022.htm#fr_207.md) Verse 22 contains 4
substantives in the [genitive](errata.htm#16.md) plural. All those are
connected with *vishtham* in the previous verse. The commentator points
out this clearly. Those living in the outskirts of towns and villages
are tanners and other low castes. They who publish the acts and
omissions of others are regarded as very vile persons, equivalent to
such low caste men mentioned above. It is difficult to differ from the
commentator, but it seems that [genitives](errata.htm#17.md) in the verse
as are used for datives, in which case the meaning would be that they
who give unto such persons shall also sink into hell. The Burdwan
translator gives a ridiculous version of verse 22.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[118:2](m13a022.htm#fr_208.md) The Bengal reading
*Brahmacharyya* is better than the Bombay reading of that word in the
accusative. Bhishma apparently gives two answers. These however involve
three. By *maryyada* is meant boundaries or limits. The duties of men
have known bounds. To transgress those bounds would be to transgress
duty. The highest indication of Righteousness is *samah* or absence of
desire for all worldly objects; hence Renunciation.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[119:1](m13a022.htm#fr_209.md) *i.e.*, by making
gifts unto even a single such Brahmana, one rescues all the ancestors
and descendants of one's race.
