### SECTION LXXVIII

"Bhishma said, 'In days of yore, king Saudasa born of Ikshvaku's race,
that foremost of eloquent men, on one occasion approached his family
priest, *viz*., Vasishtha, that foremost of Rishis, crowned with ascetic
success, capable of wandering through every region, the receptacle of
Brahma, and endued with eternal life and put him the following
question.'

"Saudasa said, 'O holy one, O sinless one, what is that in the three

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

worlds which is sacred and by reciting which at all times a man may
acquire high merit?'

"Bhishma said, 'Unto king Saudasa who stood before him with head bent in
reverence, the learned Vasishtha having first bowed unto kine and
purified himself (in body and mind), discoursed upon the mystery
relating to kine, a topic that is fraught with result highly beneficial
to all persons.'

"Vasishtha said, 'Kine are always fragrant. The perfume emanated by the
exudation of the Amytis agallochum issues out of the bodies. Kine are
the great refuge of all creatures. Kine constitute the great source of
blessing unto all. <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md) Kine are the
Past and the Future. Kine are the source of eternal growth. Kine are the
root of Prosperity. Anything given to kine is never lost. Kine
constitute the highest food. They are the best Havi for the deities. The
Mantras called Swaha and Vashat are forever established in kine. Kine
constitute the fruit of sacrifices. Sacrifices are established in kine.
Kine are the Future and the Past, and Sacrifice rest on them. Morning
and evening kine yield unto the Rishis, O foremost of men, Havi for use
in Homa, O thou of great effulgence. They who make gift of kine succeed
in transcending all sins which they may have committed and all kinds of
calamities into which they may fall, O thou of great puissance. The man
possessing ten kine and making a gift of one cow, he possessing a
hundred kine and making a gift of ten kine, and he possessing a thousand
kine and making a gift of a hundred kine, all earn the same measure of
merit. The man who, though possessed of hundred kine, does not establish
a domestic fire for daily worship, that man who though possessed of a
thousand kine does not perform sacrifices, and that man who though
possessed of wealth acts as a miser (by not making gift and discharging
the duties of hospitality), are all three regarded as not worthy of any
respect. Those men who make gift of Kapila king with their calves and
with vessel of white brass for milking them,--kine, that is, which are
not vicious and which while given away, are wrapped round with
cloths,--succeed in conquering both this and the other world. Such
persons as succeed in making gift of a bull that is still in the prime
of youth, that has all its senses strong, and that may be regarded as
the foremost one among hundreds of herds, that has large horns adorned
with ornaments (of gold or silver), unto a Brahmana possessed of Vedic
learning, succeed, O scorcher of foes, its attaining to great prosperity
and affluence each time they take birth in the world. One should never
go to bed without reciting the names of kine. Nor should one rise from
bed in the morning without a similar recitation of the names of kine.
Morning and evening one should bend one's head in reverence to kine. As
the consequence of such acts, one is sure to attain to great prosperity.
One should never feel any repugnance for the urine and the dung of the
cow. One should never eat the flesh of kine. As the consequence of this,
one is sure to attain to

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

great prosperity. One should always take the names of kine. One should
never show any disregard for kine in any way. If evil dreams are seen,
men should take the names of kine. One should always bathe, using
cow-dung at the time. One should sit on dried cowdung. One should never
cast one's urine and excreta and other secretions on cowdung. One should
never obstruct kine in any way. One should eat, sitting on a cowhide
purified by dipping it in water, and then cast one's eyes towards the
west, Sitting with restrained speech, one should eat ghee, using the
bare earth as one's dish. One reaps, in consequence of such acts, that
prosperity of which kine are the source <span
id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md). One should pour libations on the fire,
using ghee for the purpose. One should cause Brahmanas to utter
blessings upon one, by presents of ghee. One should make gift of ghee.
One should also eat ghee. As the reward of such acts one is sure to
attain to that prosperity which kine confer. That man who inspires a
vaccine form made of sesame seeds by uttering the Vedic Mantras called
by the name of Gomati, and then adorns that form with every kind of gems
and makes a gift of it, has never to suffer any grief on account of all
his acts of omission and commission,--Let kine that yield copious
measures of milk and that have horns adorned with gold,--kine *viz*.,
that are Surabhis or the daughters of Surabhis.--approach me even as
rivers approach the ocean! I always look at kine. Let kine always look
at me. Kine are ours. We are theirs. Ourselves are there where kine
are!--Even thus, at night or day, in happiness or woe, verily, at times
of even great fear,--should a man exclaim. By uttering such words he is
certain to become freed from every fear.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_109"></span>[113:1](m13b043.htm#fr_109.md) *Swastayana* is a
ceremony of propitiation, productive of blessing and destructive of
misery of every kind.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[114:1](m13b043.htm#fr_110.md) The commentator
explains that by a wet cowhide is meant a piece of cowhide that has been
dipped in water and thus purified. *Upavisya* is understood after
*Charmani*. The mention of *bhumau* implies the avoidance of dishes or
plates or cups of white brass or other allowable metals. *Gavam
pushtim*, I understand, means 'the prosperity in
[respect](errata.htm#101.md) of kine.' *i.e.*, the prosperity which kine
confer.
