### SECTION XLIV

"Yudhishthira said, "Tell me of that, O grandsire, which is the root of
all duties, which is the root of kinsmen, of home, of the *Pitris* and
of guests. I think this should be regarded as the foremost of all
duties, (*viz*., the marriage of one's daughter). Tell me, however, O
king, upon what sort of a person should one bestow one's daughter?'

"Bhishma said, 'Having enquired into the conduct and disposition of the
person, his learning and acquirements, his birth, and his acts, good
people should then bestow their daughter upon accomplished bridegrooms.
All righteous Brahmanas, O Yudhishthira, act in this way (in the matter
of the bestowal of their daughters). This is known as the Brahma
marriage, O Yudhishthira! Selecting an eligible bridegroom, the father
of the girl should cause him to marry his daughter, having, by presents
of diverse kinds, induced the bridegroom to that act. This form of
marriage constitutes the eternal practice of all good Kshatriyas. When
the father of the girl', disregarding his own wishes, bestows his
daughter upon a person whom the daughter likes and who reciprocates the
girl's sentiments, the form of marriage, O Yudhishthira, is called
Gandharva by those that are conversant with the Vedas. The wise have
said this, O king, to be the practice of the Asuras, *viz*., wedding a
girl after purchasing her at a high cost and after gratifying the
cupidity of her kinsmen. Slaying and cutting off the heads of weeping
kinsmen, the bridegroom sometimes forcibly takes away the girl he would
wed. Such wedding, O son, is called by the name of Rakshasa. Of these
five (the Brahma, the Kshatra, the Gandharva, the Asura, and the
Rakshasa), three are righteous, O Yudhishthira, and two are unrighteous.
The Paisacha and the Asura forms should never be resorted to. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) The Brahma, Kshatra, and Gandharva forms
are righteous, O prince of men! Pure or mixed, these forms should be
resorted to, without doubt. A Brahmana can take three wives. A Kshatriya
can take two wives. As regards the Vaisya, he should take a wife from
only his own order. The children born of these wives should all be
regarded as equal. <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) Of the three
wives of a Brahmana, she taken from his own order should be regarded as
the foremost. Similarly, of the two wives permitted to the Kshatriya,
she taken from his own order should [be](errata.htm#42.md) regarded as
superior. Some say that persons belonging to the three higher orders may

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

take, only for purposes of enjoyment (and not for those of virtue),
wives from the lowest or the Sudra order. Others, however, forbid the
practice.

The righteous condemn the practice of begetting issue upon Sudra women.
A Brahmana, by begetting children upon a Sudra woman, incurs the
liability of performing an expiation. A person of thirty years of age
should wed a girl of ten years of age called a Nagnika. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) Or, a person of one and twenty years of
age should wed a girl of seven years of age. That girl who has no
brother nor father should not be wed, O chief of Bharata's race, for she
may be intended as Putrika of her sire. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md) After the appearance of puberty, the girl
(if not married) should wait for three years. On the fourth year, she
should look for a husband herself (without waiting any longer for her
kinsmen to select one for her). The offspring of such a girl do not lose
their respectability, nor does union with such a girl become
disgraceful. If, instead of selecting a husband for herself, she acts
otherwise, she incurs the reproach of Prajapati herself. One should wed
that girl who is not a *Sapinda* of one's mother or of the same *Gotra*
with one's father. Even this is the usage (consistent with the sacred
law) which Manu has declared.' <span id="fr_16"></span>[3](#fn_16.md)

"Yudhishthira said, 'Desirous of marriage someone actually gives a dower
to the girl's kinsmen; someone says, the girl's kinsmen consenting
promises to give a dower; someone says, 'I shall abduct the girl by
force;' someone simply displays his wealth (to the girl's kinsmen,
intending to offer a portion thereof as dower for her); someone, again,
actually takes the hand of the girl with rites of wedding. I ask thee, O
grandsire, whose wife does the girl actually become? Unto its that are
desirous of knowing the truth, thou art the eye with which to behold.'

"Bhishma said, 'Whatever acts of men have been approved or settled in
consultation by the wise, are seen to be productive of good. False
speech, however, is always sinful. <span id="fr_17"></span>[4](#fn_17.md)
The girl himself that becomes wife, the sons

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

born of her, the Ritwiks and preceptors and disciples and Upadhyayas
present at the marriage all become liable to expiation if the girl
bestow her hand upon a person other than he whom she had promised to
wed. Some are of opinion that no expiation is necessary for such
conduct. Manu does not applaud the practice of a girl living with a
person whom she does not like. <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)
Living as wife with a person whom she does not like, leads to disgrace
and sin. No one incurs much sin in any of these cases that follow. In
forcibly abducting for marriage a girl that is bestowed upon the
abductor by the girl's kinsmen, with due rites, as also a girl for whom
dower has been paid and accepted, there is no great sin. Upon the girl's
kinsmen having expressed their consent, Mantras and Homa should be
resorted to. Such Mantras truly accomplish their purpose. Mantras and
Homa recited and performed in the case of a girl that has not been
bestowed by her kinsmen, do not accomplish their purpose. The engagement
made by the kinsmen of a girl is, no doubt, binding and sacred. But the
engagement that is entered into by the wedder and wedded, with the aid
of Mantras, is very much more so (for it is this engagement that really
creates the relationship of husband and wife). According to the dictates
of the scriptures, the husband should regard his wife as an acquisition
due to his own acts of a previous life or to what has been ordained by
God. One, therefore, incurs no reproach by accepting for wife a girl
that had been promised to another by her kinsmen or for whom dower had
been accepted by them from another.'

"Yudhishthira said, 'When after the receipt of dower for a girl, the
girl's sire sees a more eligible person present himself for her
hand,--one, that is who is endued with the aggregate of Three in
judicious proportions, does the girl's sire incur reproach by rejecting
the person from whom dower had been received in favour of him that is
more eligible? In such a case either alternative seems to be fraught
with fault, for to discard the person to whom the girl has been promised
can never be honourable, while to reject the person that is more
eligible can never be good (considering the solemn obligation there is
of bestowing one's daughter on the most eligible person). I ask, how
should the sire conduct himself so that he might be said to do that
which is beneficial? To us, of all duties this seems to demand the
utmost measure of deliberation. We are desirous of ascertaining the
truth. Thou, indeed, art our eyes! Do thou explain this to us. I am
never satiated with listening to thee!'

'Bhishma said, 'The gift of the dower does not [cause](errata.htm#43.md)
the status of wife

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

to attach to the girl. This is well-known to the person paying it. He
pays it simply as the price of the girl. Then again they that are good
never bestow their daughters, led by the dowers that others may offer.
When the person desirous of wedding happens to be endued with such
qualities as do not go down with the girl's kinsmen, it is then that
kinsmen demand dower from him. That person, however, who won over by
another's accomplishments, addresses him, saying, 'Do thou wed my girl,
adorning her with proper ornaments of gold and gems,'--and that person
who complies with this request, cannot be said to demand dower or give
it, for such a transaction is not really a sale. The bestowal of a
daughter upon acceptance of what may strictly be regarded as gifts (of
affection or love) is the eternal practice. In matters of marriage some
fathers say, 'I shall not bestow my daughter upon such and such a
person;' some say, 'I shall bestow my daughter upon such a one.'--Some
again say with vehemence, 'I must bestow my daughter upon such an
individual.' These declarations do not amount to actual marriage. People
are seen to solicit one another for the hands of maidens (and promise
and retreat). Till the hand is actually taken with due rites, marriage
cannot be said to take place. It has been beard by us that' even this
was the boon granted to men in days of old by the Maruts in respect of
maidens <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md). The Rishis have laid the
command upon all men that maidens should never be bestowed upon persons
unless the latter happen to be most fit or eligible. The daughter is the
root of desire and of descendants of the collateral line. Even this is
what I think. <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) The practice has been
known to human beings from a long time,--the practice, of sale and
purchase of the daughter. In consequence of such familiarity with the
practice, thou mayst be able, upon careful examination, to find
innumerable faults in it. The gift or acceptance of dower alone could
not be regarded as creating the status of husband and wife. Listen to
what I say on this head.

"Formerly, having defeated all the Magadhas, the Kasis, and the Kosalas,
I brought away by force two maidens for Vichitravirya. One of those two
maidens was wedded with due rites. The other maiden was not formally
wedded on the ground that she was one for whom dowry had been paid in
the form of valour. My uncle of Kuru's race, *viz*., king Valhika, said
that the maiden so brought away and not wedded with due rites should be
set free. That maiden, therefore, was recommended to Vichitravirya for
being married by him according to due rites. Doubting my father's words
I repaired to others for asking their opinion. I thought that my sire
was exceedingly punctilious in matters of morality. I then went to my
sire himself, O king, and addressed him these words from

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

desire of knowing something about the practices of righteous people in
respect of marriage, 'I desire, O sire, to know what in truth the
practices are of righteous people.' I repeated the expression of my wish
several times, so great was my eagerness and curiosity. After I had
uttered those words, that foremost of righteous men, *viz*., my sire,
Valhika answered me, saying, 'If in your opinion the status of husband
and wife be taken to attach on account of the gift and acceptance of
dowry and not from the actual taking of the maiden's hand with due
rites, the father of the maiden (by permitting his daughter to go away
with the giver of the dowry) would so himself to be the follower of a
creed other than that which is derivable from the ordinary scriptures.
Even this is what the accepted scriptures declare. Persons conversant
with morality and duty do not allow that their words are at all
authoritative who say that the status of husband and wife arises from
the gift and acceptance of dowry, and not from the actual taking of the
hand with due rites. The saying is well-known that the status of husband
and wife is created by actual bestowal of the daughter by the sire (and
her acceptance by the husband with due rites). The status of wife cannot
attach to maidens through sale and purchase. They who regard such status
to be due to sale and the gift of dowry are persons that are certainly
unacquainted with the scriptures. No one should bestow his daughter upon
such persons. In fact, they are not men to whom one may marry his
daughter. A wife should never be purchased. Nor should a father sell his
daughter. Only those persons of sinful soul who are possessed, besides,
by cupidity, and who sell and purchase female slaves for making serving
women, regard the status of wife as capable of arising from the gift and
acceptance of a dowry. On this subject some people on one occasion had
asked prince Satyavat the following question, 'If the giver of a dowry
unto the kinsmen of a maiden happens to die before marriage, can another
person take the hand of that maiden in marriage? We have doubts on this
matter. Do thou remove these doubts of ours, for thou art endued with
great wisdom and art honoured by the wise. Be thou the organ of vision
unto ourselves that are desirous of learning the truth.' Prince Satyavat
answered saying, 'The kinsmen of the maiden should bestow her upon him
whom they consider eligible. There need be no scruples in this. The
righteous act in this way without taking note of the giver of the dower
even if he be alive; while, as regards the giver that is dead, there is
not the slightest doubt. Some say that the virgin wife or widow,--one,
that is, whose marriage has not been consummated with her husband by
actual sexual congress in consequence of his absence or death,--may be
allowed to unite herself with her husband's younger brother or such
other relation. The husband dying before such consummation, the
virgin-widow may either surrender herself to her husband's younger
brother or betake herself to the practice of penances. In the opinion of
some, the younger brother of the husband or such other relation may thus
use the unused wife or widow, though others maintain that such practice,
notwithstanding

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

its prevalence, springs from desire instead of being a scriptural
ordinance. They that say so are clearly of opinion that the father of a
maiden has the right to bestow her upon any eligible person,
disregarding the dowry previously given by another and accepted by
himself. If after the hand of a maiden has been promised all the initial
rites before marriage be performed, the maiden may still be bestowed
upon a person other than the one unto whom she had been promised. Only
the giver incurs the sin of falsehood: so far, however, as the status of
wife is concerned, no injury can occur thereto. The Mantras in respect
of marriage accomplish their object of bringing about the indissoluble
union of marriage at the seventh step. The maiden becomes the wife of
him unto whom the gift is actually made with water. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) The gift of maidens should be made in the
following way. The wise know it for certain. A superior Brahmana should
wed a maiden that is not unwilling, that belongs to a family equal to
his own in purity or status, and that is given away by her brother. Such
a girl should be wed in the presence of fire, with due rites, causing
her, amongst other things, to circumambulate for the usual number of
times."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_12"></span>[17:1](m13b009.htm#fr_12.md) It would be curious to
see how the commentator Nilakantha seeks to include within these five
the eight forms of marriage mentioned by Manu. The fact is, such parts
of the *Mahabharata* are unquestionably more ancient than Manu. The
mention of Manu is either an instance of interpolation or there must
have been an older Manu upon whose work *the* Manu we know has been
based. The *Asura* and the *Rakshasa* forms are unequivocally condemned.
Yet the commentator seeks to make out that the Rakshasa form is open to
the Kshatriyas. The fact is, the Rakshasa was sometimes called the
*Paisacha*. The distinction between those two forms was certainly of
later origin.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[17:2](m13b009.htm#fr_13.md) Thus, there was no
difference, in status, in ancient times, between children born of a
Brahmana, a Kshatriya or a Vaisya mother. The difference of status was
of later origin.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[18:1](m13b009.htm#fr_14.md) *Nagnika* is said to
be one who wears a single piece of cloth. A girl in whom the signs of
puberty have not appeared does not require more than a single piece of
cloth to cover her. The mention of *Nagnika*, the commentator thinks, is
due to an interdiction about wedding a girl of even ten years in whom
signs of puberty have appeared.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[18:2](m13b009.htm#fr_15.md) When a father happens
to have an only daughter, he frequently bestows her in marriage upon
some eligible youth on the understanding that the son born of her shall
be the son, for purposes of both Sraddha rites and inheritance, not of
the husband begetting him but of the girl's father. Such a contract
would be valid whether expressed or not at the time of marriage. The
mere wish of the girl's father, unexpressed at the time of marriage,
would convert the son into a son not of the father who begets him but of
the father of the girl herself. A daughter reserved for such a purpose
is said to be a *putrikadharmini* or 'invested with the character of a
son.' To wed such a girl was not honourable. It was in effect an
abandonment of the fruits of marriage. Even if dead at the time of
marriage, still if the father had, while living, cherished such a wish,
that would convert the girl into a putrikadharmini. The repugnance to
wedding girls without father and brothers exists to this day.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[18:3](m13b009.htm#fr_16.md) For understanding the
meanings of *Sapinda* and *Sagotra* see any work on Hindu law civil or
canonical.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[18:4](m13b009.htm#fr_17.md) These verses are
exceedingly terse. The commentator explains that what is intended is
that under the third and fourth circumstances the giver of the girl
incurs no sin; under <span id="page_19">p. 19</span> the second, the
bestower of the girl (upon a person other than he unto whom a promise
had been made) incurs fault. The status of wife, however, cannot attach
simply in consequence of the promise to bestow upon the promiser of the
dower. The relationship of husband and wife arises from actual wedding.
For all that, when the kinsmen meet and say, with due rites, 'This girl
is this one's wife,' the marriage becomes complete. Only the giver
incurs sin by not giving her to the promised person.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[19:1](m13b009.htm#fr_18.md) Hence, having promised
to wed such a one, she is at liberty to give him over and wed another
whom she likes.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[20:1](m13b009.htm#fr_19.md) In consequence of that
boon no one incurs sin by retracting promises of bestowing daughters
upon others in view of more eligible husbands.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[20:2](m13b009.htm#fr_20.md) Hence, no one should
bestow his daughter upon a person that is not eligible, for the
offspring of such marriage can never be good and such a marriage can
never make the daughter's sire or kinsmen happy.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[22:1](m13b009.htm#fr_21.md) One of the most
important rites of marriage is the ceremony of circumambulation. The
girl is now borne around the bride-groom by her kinsmen. Formerly, she
used to walk herself. All gifts, again, are made with water. The fact
is, when a thing is given away, the giver, uttering the formula,
sprinkles a drop of water upon it with a blade of Kusa grass.
