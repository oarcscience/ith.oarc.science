</p>  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER II<br> Of Doctrines</h1>  
<p><i>Sanjaya.</i> Him, filled with such compassion and such grief,<br> With eyes tear-dimmed, despondent, in stern words<br> The Driver, Madhusudan, thus addressed:<br> Krishna. How hath this weakness taken thee?<br> Whence springs<br> The inglorious trouble, shameful to the brave,<br> Barring the path of virtue? Nay, Arjun!<br> Forbid thyself to feebleness! it mars<br> Thy warrior-name! cast off the coward-fit!<br> Wake! Be thyself! Arise, Scourge of thy Foes!<br> Arjuna. How can I, in the battle, shoot with shafts<br> On Bhishma, or on Drona- O thou Chief!-<br> Both worshipful, both honourable men?</p>  
<p>Better to live on beggar's bread<br> With those we love alive,<br> Than taste their blood in rich feasts spread,<br> And guiltily survive!<br> Ah! were it worse- who knows?- to be<br> Victor or vanquished here,<br> When those confront us angrily<br> Whose death leaves living drear?<br> In pity lost, by doubtings tossed,<br> My thoughts- distracted- turn<br> To Thee, the Guide I reverence most,<br> That I may counsel learn:<br> I know not what would heal the grief<br> Burned into soul and sense,<br> If I were earth's unchallenged chief-<br> A god- and these gone thence!</p>  
<p><i>Sanjaya.</i> So spake Arjuna to the Lord of Hearts,<br> And sighing, "I will not fight!" held silence then.<br> To whom, with tender smile, (O Bharata!)<br> While the Prince wept despairing 'twixt those hosts,<br> Krishna made answer in divinest verse:<br> Krishna. Thou grievest where no grief should be! thou speak'st<br> Words lacking wisdom! for the wise in heart<br> Mourn not for those that live, nor those that die.<br> Nor I, nor thou, nor any one of these,<br> Ever was not, nor ever will not be,<br> For ever and for ever afterwards.<br> All, that doth live, lives always! To man's frame<br> As there come infancy and youth and age,<br> So come there raisings-up and layings-down<br> Of other and of other life-abodes,<br> Which the wise know, and fear not. This that irks-<br> Thy sense-life, thrilling to the elements-<br> Bringing thee heat and cold, sorrows and joys,<br> 'Tis brief and mutable! Bear with it, Prince!<br> As the wise bear. The soul which is not moved,<br> The soul that with a strong and constant calm<br> Takes sorrow and takes joy indifferently,<br> Lives in the life undying! That which is<br> Can never cease to be; that which is not<br> Will not exist. To see this truth of both<br> Is theirs who part essence from accident,<br> Substance from shadow. Indestructible,<br> Learn thou! the Life is, spreading life through all;<br> It cannot anywhere, by any means,<br> Be anywise diminished, stayed, or changed.<br> But for these fleeting frames which it informs<br> With spirit deathless, endless, infinite,<br> They perish. Let them perish, Prince! and fight!<br> He who shall say, "Lo! I have slain a man!"<br> He who shall think, "Lo! I am slain!" those both<br> Know naught! Life cannot slay. Life is not slain!<br> Never the spirit was born; the spirit shall cease to be never;<br> Never was time it was not; End and Beginning are dreams!<br> Birthless and deathless and changeless remaineth the spirit for<br> ever;<br> Death hath not touched it at all, dead though the house of it<br> seems!<br> Who knoweth it exhaustless, self-sustained,<br> Immortal, indestructible,- shall such<br> Say, "I have killed a man, or caused to kill?"</p>  
<p>Nay, but as when one layeth<br> His worn-out robes away,<br> And, taking new ones, sayeth,<br> "These will I wear to-day!"<br> So putteth by the spirit<br> Lightly its garb of flesh,<br> And passeth to inherit<br> A residence afresh.</p>  
<p>I say to thee weapons reach not the Life;<br> Flame burns it not, waters cannot o'erwhelm,<br> Nor dry winds wither it. Impenetrable,<br> Unentered, unassailed, unharmed, untouched,<br> Immortal, all-arriving, stable, sure,<br> Invisible, ineffable, by word<br> And thought uncompassed, ever all itself,<br> Thus is the Soul declared! How wilt thou, then,-<br> Knowing it so,- grieve when thou shouldst not grieve?<br> How, if thou hearest that the man new-dead<br> Is, like the man new-born, still living man-<br> One same, existent Spirit- wilt thou weep?<br> The end of birth is death; the end of death<br> Is birth: this is ordained! and mournest thou,<br> Chief of the stalwart arm! for what befalls<br> Which could not otherwise befall? The birth<br> Of living things comes unperceived; the death<br> Comes unperceived; between them, beings perceive:<br> What is there sorrowful herein, dear Prince?</p>  
<p>Wonderful, wistful, to contemplate!<br> Difficult, doubtful, to speak upon!<br> Strange and great for tongue to relate,<br> Mystical hearing for every one!<br> Nor wotteth man this, what a marvel it is,<br> When seeing, and saying, and hearing are done!</p>  
<p>This Life within all living things, my Prince!<br> Hides beyond harm; scorn thou to suffer, then,<br> For that which cannot suffer. Do thy part!<br> Be mindful of thy name, and tremble not!<br> Nought better can betide a martial soul<br> Than lawful war; happy the warrior<br> To whom comes joy of battle- comes, as now,<br> Glorious and fair, unsought; opening for him<br> A gateway unto Heav'n. But, if thou shunn'st<br> This honourable field- a Kshattriya-<br> If, knowing thy duty and thy task, thou bidd'st<br> Duty and task go by- that shall be sin!<br> And those to come shall speak thee infamy<br> From age to age; but infamy is worse<br> For men of noble blood to bear than death!<br> The chiefs upon their battle-chariots<br> Will deem 'twas fear that drove thee from the fray.<br> Of those who held thee mighty-souled the scorn<br> Thou must abide, while all thine enemies<br> Will scatter bitter speech of thee, to mock<br> The valour which thou hadst; what fate could fall<br> More grievously than this? Either- being killed-<br> Thou wilt win Swarga's safety, or- alive<br> And victor- thou wilt reign an earthly king.<br> Therefore, arise, thou Son of Kunti! brace<br> Thine arm for conflict, nerve thy heart to meet-<br> As things alike to thee- pleasure or pain,<br> Profit or ruin, victory or defeat:<br> So minded, gird thee to the fight, for so<br> Thou shalt not sin!<br> Thus far I speak to thee<br> As from the "Sankhya"- unspiritually-<br> Hear now the deeper teaching of the Yog,<br> Which holding, understanding, thou shalt burst<br> Thy Karmabandh, the bondage of wrought deeds.<br> Here shall no end be hindered, no hope marred,<br> No loss be feared: faith- yea, a little faith-<br> Shall save thee from the anguish of thy dread.<br> Here, Glory of the Kurus! shines one rule-<br> One steadfast rule- while shifting souls have laws<br> Many and hard. Specious, but wrongful deem<br> The speech of those ill-taught ones who extol<br> The letter of their Vedas, saying, "This<br> Is all we have, or need;" being weak at heart<br> With wants, seekers of Heaven: which comes- they say-<br> As "fruit of good deeds done;" promising men<br> Much profit in new births for works of faith;<br> In various rites abounding; following whereon<br> Large merit shall accrue towards wealth and power;<br> Albeit, who wealth and power do most desire<br> Least fixity of soul have such, least hold<br> On heavenly meditation. Much these teach,<br> From Veds, concerning the "three qualities;"<br> But thou, be free of the "three qualities,"<br> Free of the "pairs of opposites," and free<br> From that sad righteousness which calculates;<br> Self-ruled, Arjuna! simple, satisfied.<br> Look! like as when a tank pours water forth<br> To suit all needs, so do these Brahmans draw<br> Text for all wants from tank of Holy Writ.<br> But thou, want not! ask not! Find full reward<br> Of doing right in right! Let right deeds be<br> Thy motive, not the fruit which comes from them.<br> And live in action! Labour! Make thine acts<br> Thy piety, casting all self aside,<br> Contemning gain and merit; equable<br> In good or evil: equability<br> Is Yog, is piety!<br> Yet, the right act<br> Is less, far less, than the right-thinking mind.<br> Seek refuge in thy soul; have there thy heaven!<br> Scorn them that follow virtue for her gifts!<br> The mind of pure devotion- even here-<br> Casts equally aside good deeds and bad,<br> Passing above them. Unto pure devotion<br> Devote thyself: with perfect meditation<br> Comes perfect act, and the righthearted rise-<br> More certainly because they seek no gain-<br> Forth from the bands of body, step by step,<br> To highest seats of bliss. When thy firm soul<br> Hath shaken off those tangled oracles<br> Which ignorantly guide, then shall it soar<br> To high neglect of what's denied or said,<br> This way or that way, in doctrinal writ.<br> Troubled no longer by the priestly lore,<br> Safe shall it live, and sure; steadfastly bent<br> On meditation. This is Yog- and Peace!<br> Arjuna. What is his mark who hath that steadfast heart,<br> Confirmed in holy meditation? How<br> Know we his speech, Kesava? Sits he, moves he<br> Like other men?<br> Krishna. When one, O Pritha's Son!-<br> Abandoning desires which shake the mind-<br> Finds in his soul full comfort for his soul,<br> He hath attained the Yog- that man is such!<br> In sorrows not dejected, and in joys<br> Not overjoyed; dwelling outside the stress<br> Of passion, fear, and anger; fixed in calms<br> Of lofty contemplation;- such an one<br> Is Muni, is the Sage, the true Recluse!<br> He who to none and nowhere overbound<br> By ties of flesh, takes evil things and good<br> Neither desponding nor exulting, such<br> Bears wisdom's plainest mark He who shall draw<br> As the wise tortoise draws its four feet safe<br> Under its shield, his five frail senses back<br> Under the spirit's buckler from the world<br> Which else assails them, such an one, my Prince!<br> Hath wisdom's mark! Things that solicit sense<br> Hold off from the self-governed; nay, it comes,<br> The appetites of him who lives beyond<br> Depart,- aroused no more. Yet may it chance,<br> O Son of Kunti that a governed mind<br> Shall some time feel the sense-storms sweep, and wrest<br> Strong self-control by the roots. Let him regain<br> His kingdom! let him conquer this, and sit<br> On Me intent. That man alone is wise<br> Who keeps the mastery of himself! If one<br> Ponders on objects of the sense, there springs<br> Attraction; from attraction grows desire,<br> Desire flames to fierce passion, passion breeds<br> Recklessness; then the memory- all betrayed-<br> Lets noble purpose go, and saps the mind,<br> Till purpose, mind, and man are all undone.<br> But, if one deals with objects of the sense<br> Not loving and not hating, making them<br> Serve his free soul, which rests serenely lord,<br> Lo! such a man comes to tranquillity;<br> And out of that tranquillity shall rise<br> The end and healing of his earthly pains,<br> Since the will governed sets the soul at peace.<br> The soul of the ungoverned is not his,<br> Nor hath he knowledge of himself; which lacked,<br> How grows serenity? and, wanting that,<br> Whence shall he hope for happiness?<br> The mind<br> That gives itself to follow shows of sense<br> Seeth its helm of wisdom rent away,<br> And, like a ship in waves of whirlwind, drives<br> To wreck and death. Only with him, great Prince!<br> Whose senses are not swayed by things of sense-<br> Only with him who holds his mastery,<br> Shows wisdom perfect. What is midnight-gloom<br> To unenlightened souls shines wakeful day<br> To his clear gaze; what seems as wakeful day<br> Is known for night, thick night of ignorance,<br> To his true-seeing eyes. Such is the Saint!<br> And like the ocean, day by day receiving<br> Floods from all lands, which never overflows;<br> Its boundary-line not leaping, and not leaving,<br> Fed by the rivers, but unswelled by those;-<br> So is the perfect one! to his soul's ocean<br> The world of sense pours streams of witchery,<br> They leave him as they find, without commotion,<br> Taking their tribute, but remaining sea.<br> Yea! whoso, shaking off the yoke of flesh<br> Lives lord, not servant, of his lusts; set free<br> From pride, from passion, from the sin of "Self,"<br> Toucheth tranquillity! O Pritha's Son!<br> That is the state of Brahm! There rests no dread<br> When that last step is reached! Live where he will,<br> Die when he may, such passeth from all 'plaining,<br> To blest Nirvana, with the Gods, attaining.</p>  
<p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER II OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Sankhya-Yog,"<br> Or "The Book of Doctrines." </p>
