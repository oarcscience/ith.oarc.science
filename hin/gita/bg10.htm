<p><i>Krishna.</i> Hear farther yet, thou Long-Armed Lord! these latest<br> words I say-<br> Uttered to bring thee bliss and peace, who lovest Me alway-<br> Not the great company of gods nor kingly Rishis know<br> My Nature, Who have made the gods and Rishis long ago;<br> He only knoweth- only he is free of sin, and wise,<br> Who seeth Me, Lord of the Worlds, with faith-enlightened eyes,<br> Unborn, undying, unbegun. Whatever Natures be<br> To mortal men distributed, those natures spring from Me!<br> Intellect, skill, enlightenment, endurance, self-control,<br> Truthfulness, equability, and grief or joy of soul,<br> And birth and death, and fearfulness, and fearlessness, and shame,<br> And honour, and sweet harmlessness, and peace which is the same<br> Whate'er befalls, and mirth, and tears, and piety and thrift,<br> And wish to give, and will to help,- all cometh of My gift!<br> The Seven Chief Saints, the Elders Four, the Lordly Manus set-<br> Sharing My work- to rule the worlds, these too did I beget;<br> And Rishis, Pitris, Manus, all, by one thought of My mind;<br> Thence did arise, to fill this world, the races of mankind;<br> Wherefrom who comprehends My Reign of mystic Majesty-<br> That truth of truths- is thenceforth linked in faultless faith to<br> Me:<br> Yea! knowing Me the source of all, by Me all creatures wrought,<br> The wise in spirit cleave to Me, into My Being brought;<br> Hearts fixed on Me; breaths breathed to Me; praising Me, each to<br> each,<br> So have they happiness and peace, with pious thought and speech;<br> And unto these- thus serving well, thus loving ceaselessly-<br> I give a mind of perfect mood, whereby they draw to Me;<br> And, all for love of them, within their darkened souls I dwell,<br> And, with bright rays of wisdom's lamp, their ignorance dispel.<br> Arjuna. Yes! Thou art Parabrahm! The High Abode!<br> The Great Purification! Thou art God<br> Eternal, All-creating, Holy, First,<br> Without beginning! Lord of Lords and Gods!<br> Declared by all the Saints- by Narada,<br> Vyasa Asita, and Devalas;<br> And here Thyself declaring unto me!<br> What Thou hast said now know I to be truth,<br> O Kesava! that neither gods nor men<br> Nor demons comprehend Thy mystery<br> Made manifest, Divinest! Thou Thyself<br> Thyself alone dost know, Maker Supreme!<br> Master of all the living! Lord of Gods!<br> King of the Universe! To Thee alone<br> Belongs to tell the heavenly excellence<br> Of those perfections wherewith Thou dost fill<br> These worlds of Thine; Pervading, Immanent!<br> How shall I learn, Supremest Mystery!<br> To know Thee, though I muse continually?<br> Under what form of Thine unnumbered forms<br> Mayst Thou be grasped? Ah! yet again recount,<br> Clear and complete, Thy great appearances,<br> The secrets of Thy Majesty and Might,<br> Thou High Delight of Men! Never enough<br> Can mine ears drink the Amrit of such words!<br> Krishna. Hanta! So be it! Kuru Prince! I will to thee unfold<br> Some portions of My Majesty, whose powers are manifold!<br> I am the Spirit seated deep in every creature's heart;<br> From Me they come; by Me they live; at My word they depart!<br> Vishnu of the Adityas I am, those Lords of Light;<br> Maritchi of the Maruts, the Kings of Storm and Blight;<br> By day I gleam, the golden Sun of burning cloudless Noon;<br> By Night, amid the asterisms I glide, the dappled Moon!<br> Of Vedas I am Sama-Ved, of gods in Indra's Heaven<br> Vasava; of the faculties to living beings given<br> The mind which apprehends and thinks; of Rudras Sankara;<br> Of Yakshas and of Rakshasas, Vittesh; and Pavaka<br> Of Vasus, and of mountain-peaks Meru; Vrihaspati<br> Know Me 'mid planetary Powers; 'mid Warriors heavenly<br> Skanda; of all the water-floods the Sea which drinketh each,<br> And Bhrigu of the holy Saints, and OM of sacred speech;<br> Of prayers the prayer ye whisper; of hills Himila's snow,<br> And Aswattha, the fig-tree, of all the trees that grow;<br> Of the Devarshis, Narada; and Chitrarath of them<br> That sing in Heaven, and Kapila of Munis, and the gem<br> Of flying steeds, Uchchaisravas, from Amritwave which burst;<br> Of elephants Airavata; of males the Best and First;<br> Of weapons Heav'n's hot thunderbolt; of cows white Kamadhuk,<br> From whose great milky udder-teats all hearts' desires are strook;<br> Vasuki of the serpent-tribes, round Mandara entwined;<br> And thousand-fanged Ananta, on whose broad coils reclined<br> Leans Vishnu; and of water-things Varuna; Aryam<br> Of Pitris, and, of those that judge, Yama the Judge I am;<br> Of Daityas dread Prahlada; of what metes days and years,<br> Time's self I am; of woodland-beasts- buffaloes, deers, and bears-<br> The lordly-painted tiger; of birds the vast Garud,<br> The whirlwind 'mid the winds; 'mid chiefs Rama with blood imbrued,<br> Makar 'mid fishes of the sea, and Ganges 'mid the streams;<br> Yea! First, and Last, and Centre of all which is or seems<br> I am, Arjuna! Wisdom Supreme of what is wise,<br> Words on the uttering lips I am, and eyesight of the eyes.<br> And "A" of written characters, Dwandwa of knitted speech,<br> And Endless Life, and boundless Love, whose power<br> sustaineth each;<br> And bitter Death which seizes all, and joyous sudden Birth,<br> Which brings to light all beings that are to be on earth;<br> And of the viewless virtues, Fame, Fortune, Song am I,<br> And Memory, and Patience; and Craft, and Constancy:<br> Of Vedic hymns the Vrihatsam, of metres Gayatri,<br> Of months the Margasirsha, of all the seasons three<br> The flower-wreathed Spring; in dicer's-play the conquering<br> Double-Eight;<br> The splendour of the splendid, and the greatness of the great,<br> Victory I am, and Action! and the goodness of the good,<br> And Vasudev of Vrishni's race, and of this Pandu brood<br> Thyself!- Yea, my Arjuna! thyself; for thou art Mine!<br> Of poets Usana, of saints Vyasa, sage divine;<br> The policy of conquerors, the potency of kings,<br> The great unbroken silence in learning's secret things;<br> The lore of all the learned, the seed of all which springs.<br> Living or lifeless, still or stirred, whatever beings be,<br> None of them is in all the worlds, but it exists by Me!<br> Nor tongue can tell, Arjuna! nor end of telling come<br> Of these My boundless glories, whereof I teach thee some;<br> For wheresoe'er is wondrous work, and majesty, and might,<br> From Me hath all proceeded. Receive thou this aright!<br> Yet how shouldst thou receive, O Prince! the vastness of this word?<br> I, who am all, and made it all, abide its separate Lord!</p>  
<p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER X OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Vibhuti Yog,"<br> Or "The Book of Religion by the Heavenly Perfections." </p>
