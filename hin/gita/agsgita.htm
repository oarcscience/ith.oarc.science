<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P>
<P>&#9;The Gita is a doctrine of universal truth. Its message is universal, sublime, 
  and non-sectarian although it is a part of the scriptural trinity of Sanaatana 
  Dharma, commonly known as Hinduism. The Gita is very easy to understand in any 
  language for a mature mind. A repeated reading with faith will reveal all the 
  sublime ideas contained in it. A few abstruse statements are interspersed here 
  and there but they have no direct bearing on practical issues or the central 
  theme of Gita. The Gita deals with the most sacred metaphysical science. It 
  imparts the knowledge of the Self and answers two universal questions: Who am 
  I, and how can I lead a happy and peaceful life in this world of dualities. 
  It is a book of yoga, the moral and spiritual growth, for mankind based on the 
  cardinal principles of Hindu religion.</P>
<P>&#9;The message of Gita came to humanity because of Arjuna’s unwillingness 
  to do his duty as a warrior, because fighting involved destruction and killing. 
  Nonviolence or Ahimsa is one of the most fundamental tenets of Hinduism. All 
  lives, human or non-human, are sacred. This immortal discourse between the Supreme 
  Lord, Krishna, and His devotee-friend, Arjuna, occurs not in a temple, a secluded 
  forest, or on a mountain top but on a battlefield on the eve of a war and is 
  recorded in the great epic, Mahaabhaarata. In Gita Lord Krishna advises Arjuna 
  to get up and fight. This may create a misunderstanding of the principles of 
  Ahimsa if the background of the war of Mahaabhaarata is not kept in mind. Therefore, 
  a brief historical description is in order.</P>
<P>&#9;In ancient times there was a king who had two sons, Dhritaraashtra and 
  Paandu. The former was born blind, therefore, Paandu inherited the kingdom. 
  Paandu had five sons. They were called the Paandavs. Dhritaraashtra had one 
  hundred sons. They were called the Kauravs. Duryodhana was the eldest of the 
  Kauravs. </P>
<P>&#9;After the death of king Paandu the Paandavs became the lawful king. Duryodhana 
  was a very jealous person. He also wanted the kingdom. The kingdom was divided 
  into two halves between the Paandavs and the Kauravs . Duryodhana was not satisfied 
  with his share of the kingdom. He wanted the entire kingdom for himself. He 
  unsuccessfully planned several foul plays to kill the Paandavs and take away 
  their kingdom. He unlawfully took possession of the entire kingdom of the Paandavs 
  and refused to give back even an acre of land without a war. All mediation by 
  Lord Krishna and others failed. The big war of Mahaabhaarata was thus inevitable. 
  The Paandavs were unwilling participants. They had only two choices: Fight for 
  their right as a matter of duty or run away from war and accept defeat in the 
  name of peace and nonviolence. Arjuna, one of the five Paandava brothers, faced 
  the dilemma in the battlefield whether to fight or run away from war for the 
  sake of peace. </P>
<P>&#9;Arjuna’s dilemma is, in reality, the universal dilemma. Every human being 
  faces dilemmas, big and small, in their everyday life when performing their 
  duties. Arjuna’s dilemma was the biggest of all. He had to make a choice between 
  fighting the war and killing his most revered guru, very dear friends, close 
  relatives, and many innocent warriors or running away from the battlefield for 
  the sake of preserving the peace and nonviolence. The entire seven hundred verses 
  of the Gita is a discourse between Lord Krishna and the confused Arjuna on the 
  battlefield of Kurukshetra near New Delhi, India, in about 3,100 years BCE. 
  This discourse was narrated to the blind king, Dhritaraashtr, by his charioteer, 
  Sanjaya, as an eyewitness war report.</P>
<P>&#9;The main objective of the Gita is to help people <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> 
  struggling in the darkness of ignorance <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> cross the 
  ocean of transmigration and reach the spiritual shore of liberation while living 
  and working in the society. The central teaching of the Gita is the attainment 
  of freedom or happiness from the bondage of life by doing one’s duty. Always 
  remember the glory and greatness of the creator and do your duty efficiently 
  without being attached to or affected by the results even if that duty may at 
  times demand unavoidable violence. Some people neglect or give up their duty 
  in life for the sake of a spiritual life while others excuse themselves from 
  spiritual practices because they believe that they have no time. The Lord’s 
  message is to sanctify the entire living process itself. Whatever a person does 
  or thinks ought to be done for the glory and satisfaction of the Maker. No effort 
  or cost is necessary for this process. Do your duty as a service to the Lord 
  and humanity and see God alone in everything in a spiritual frame of mind. In 
  order to gain such a spiritual frame of mind, personal discipline, austerity, 
  penance, good conduct, selfless service, yogic practices, meditation, worship, 
  prayer, rituals, and study of scriptures, as well as the company of holy persons, 
  pilgrimage, chanting of the holy names of God, and Self-inquiry are needed to 
  purify the body, mind, and intellect. One must learn to give up lust, anger, 
  greed, and establish mastery over the six senses (hearing, touch, sight, taste, 
  smell, and mind) by the purified intellect. One should always remember that 
  all works are done by the energy of nature and that he or she is not the doer 
  but only an instrument. One must strive for excellence in all undertakings but 
  maintain equanimity in success and failure, gain and loss, and pain and pleasure. 
</P>
<P>&#9;The ignorance of metaphysical knowledge is humanity’s greatest predicament. 
  A scripture, being the voice of transcendence, cannot be translated. Language 
  is incapable and translations are defective to clearly impart the knowledge 
  of the Absolute. In this rendering, an attempt has been made to keep the style 
  as close as possible to the original Sanskrit poetry and yet make it easy to 
  read and understand. An attempt has been made to improve the clarity by adding 
  words or phrases, within parenthesis, in the English translation of the verses. 
  A glossary and index have been included. One hundred and thirty-three (133) 
  key verses are printed in <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">red</font></B> for the convenience 
  of beginners. We suggest all our readers to ponder, contemplate, and act upon 
  these <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">red</font></B> key verses. The beginners and 
  the busy executives should first read and understand the meaning of these key 
  verses before delving deep into the bottomless ocean of transcendental knowledge 
  of the Gita.</P>
<P>&#9;According to the scriptures no sin, however heinous, can affect the one 
  who reads, ponders, and practices the teachings of Gita any more than water 
  affects the lotus leaf. The Lord Himself resides where Gita is kept, read, chanted, 
  or taught. The Gita is the knowledge Supreme and the sound embodiment of the 
  Absolute and the Eternal. The one who reads, ponders, and practices the teachings 
  of Gita with faith and devotion will attain Moksha (or Nirvana) by the grace 
  of God.</P>
<P>&#9;This book is dedicated to my Sadguru, His Holiness Swami Chidanandji (Muniji) 
  Maharaj and all other gurus whose blessings, grace, and teachings have been 
  invaluable. It is offered to the greatest guru, Lord Krishna, with love and 
  devotion. May the Lord accept it, and bless those who repeatedly read this with 
  peace, happiness, and the true knowledge of the Self.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>ARJUNA’S DILEMMA</B></P>
<P><I>&#9;The war of Mahabharata has begun after all negotiations by Lord Krishna 
  and others to avoid it failed. The blind King (Dhritarashtra) was never very 
  sure about the victory of his sons (Kauravas) in spite of their superior army. 
  Sage Vyasa, the author of Mahabharata, wanted to give the blind king the boon 
  of eyesight so that the king could see the horrors of the war for which he was 
  primarily responsible. But the king refused the offer. He did not want to see 
  the horrors of the war; but preferred to get the war report through his charioteer, 
  Sanjaya. Sage Vyasa granted the power of clairvoyance to Sanjaya. With this 
  power Sanjaya could see, hear, and recall the events of the past, present, and 
  the future. He was able to give an instant replay of the eye witness war report 
  to the blind King sitting in the palace. </I></P>
<P><I>&#9;Bhishma, the mightiest man and the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava’s 
  army, is disabled by Arjuna and is lying on deathbed in the battleground on 
  the tenth day of the eighteen day war. Upon hearing this bad news from Sanjaya, 
  the blind King looses all hopes for victory of his sons. Now the King wants 
  to know the details of the war from the beginning, including how the mightiest 
  man, and the commander-in-chief of his superior army <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> 
  who had a boon of dying at his own will <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> was defeated 
  in the battlefield. The teaching of the Gita begins with the inquiry of the 
  blind King, after Sanjaya described how Bhishma was defeated, as follows:</I></P>
<P>The King inquired: Sanjaya, please now tell me, in details, what did my people 
  (the Kauravas) and the Pandavas do in the battlefield before the war started? 
  (1.01)</P>
<P>Sanjaya said: O King, After seeing the battle formation of the Pandava’s army, 
  your son approached his guru and spoke these words: (1.02)</P>
<P>O Master, behold this mighty army of the Pandavas, arranged in battle formation 
  by your other talented disciple! There are many great warriors, valiant men, 
  heroes, and mighty archers. (1.03-06)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">Introduction Of The Army Commanders</FONT></I></B></P>
<P>Also there are many heroes on my side who have risked their lives for me. I 
  shall name few distinguished commanders of my army for your information. He 
  named all the officers of his army, and said: They are armed with various weapons, 
  and are skilled in warfare. (1.07-09)</P>
<P>Our army is invincible, while their army is easy to conquer. Therefore all 
  of you, occupying your respective positions, protect our commander-in-chief. 
  (1.10-11)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">War Starts With The Blowing Of Conch 
  Shells </FONT></I></B></P>
<P>The mighty commander-in-chief and the eldest man of the dynasty, roared as 
  a lion and blew his conch loudly, bringing joy to your son. (1.12)</P>
<P>Soon after that; conches, kettledrums, cymbals, drums, and trumpets were sounded 
  together. The commotion was tremendous. (1.13)</P>
<P>After that, Lord Krishna and Arjuna, seated in a grand chariot yoked with white 
  horses, blew their celestial conches. (1.14)</P>
<P>Krishna blew His conch first, and then Arjuna and all other commanders of various 
  divisions of the army of Pandavas blew their respective conches. The tumultuous 
  uproar, resounding through the earth and sky, tore the hearts of your sons. 
  (1.15-19)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">Arjuna Wants To Inspect The Army 
  Against Whom He Is About To Fight</FONT></I></B></P>
<P>Seeing your sons standing, and the war about to begin with the hurling of weapons; 
  Arjuna, whose banner bore the emblem of Lord Hanumana, took up his bow and spoke 
  these words to Lord Krishna: O Lord, please stop my chariot between the two 
  armies until I behold those who stand here eager for the battle and with whom 
  I must engage in this act of war. (1.20-22)</P>
<P>I wish to see those who are willing to serve and appease the evil-minded Kauravas 
  by assembling here to fight the battle. (1.23)</P>
<P>Sanjaya said: O King; Lord Krishna, as requested by Arjuna, placed the best 
  of all the chariots in the midst of the two armies facing Arjuna's grandfather, 
  his guru and all other Kings; and said to Arjuna: Behold these assembled soldiers! 
  (1.24-25)</P>
<P>Arjuna saw his uncles, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons, 
  grandsons, and other comrades in the army. (1.26)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">ARJUNA'S DILEMMA </FONT></I></B></P>
<P>After seeing fathers-in-law, companions, and all his kinsmen standing in the 
  ranks of the two armies, Arjuna was overcome with great compassion and sorrowfully 
  spoke these words: O Krishna, seeing my kinsmen standing with a desire to fight, 
  my limbs fail and my mouth becomes dry. My body quivers and my hairs stand on 
  end. (1.27-29)</P>
<P>The bow slips from my hand, and my skin intensely burns. My head turns, I am 
  unable to stand steady, and O Krishna, I see bad omens. I see no use of killing 
  my kinsmen in battle. (1.30-31)</P>
<P>I desire neither victory, nor pleasure nor kingdom, O Krishna. What is the 
  use of the kingdom, or enjoyment, or even life, O Krishna? Because all those 
  <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> for whom we desire kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures 
  <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> are standing here for the battle, giving up their 
  lives. (1.32-33)</P>
<P>I do not wish to kill my teachers, uncles, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, 
  fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives who are about 
  to kill us, even for the sovereignty of the three worlds, let alone for this 
  earthly kingdom, O Krishna. (1.34-35)</P>
<P>O Lord Krishna, what pleasure shall we find in killing our cousin brothers? 
  Upon killing these felons we shall incur sin only. (1.36)</P>
<P>Therefore, we should not kill our cousin brothers. How can we be happy after 
  killing our relatives, O Krishna? (1.37)</P>
<P>Though they are blinded by greed, and do not see evil in the destruction of 
  the family, or sin in being treacherous to friends. Why should not we, who clearly 
  see evil in the destruction of the family, think about turning away from this 
  sin, O Krishna? (1.38-39)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">ARJUNA DESCRIBES THE EVILS OF WAR</FONT></I></B></P>
<P>Eternal family traditions and codes of moral conduct are destroyed with the 
  destruction of the family. And immorality prevails in the family due to the 
  destruction of family traditions. (1.40)</P>
<P>And when immorality prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupted; 
  when women are corrupted, unwanted progeny is born. (1.41)</P>
<P>This brings the family and the slayers of the family to hell, because the spirits 
  of their ancestors are degraded when deprived of ceremonial offerings of love 
  and respect by the unwanted progeny. (1.42)</P>
<P>The everlasting qualities of social order and family traditions of those who 
  destroy their family are ruined by the sinful act of illegitimacy. (1.43)</P>
<P>We have been told, O Krishna, that people whose family traditions are destroyed 
  necessarily dwell in hell for a long time. (1.44)</P>
<P>Alas! We are ready to commit a great sin by striving to slay our relatives 
  because of greed for the pleasures of the kingdom. (1.45)</P>
<P>It would be far better for me if my cousin brothers kill me with their weapons 
  in battle while I am unarmed and unresisting. (1.46)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">WHEN GOING GETS TOUGH, EVEN TOUGH 
  ONES CAN GET DELUDED</FONT></I></B></P>
<P>Sanjaya said: Having said this in the battlefield and casting aside his bow 
  and arrow, Arjuna sat down on the seat of the chariot with his mind overwhelmed 
  with sorrow. (1.47)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>CHAPTER 2</B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>TRANSCENDENTAL KNOWLEDGE</B></P>
<P>Sanjaya said: Lord Krishna spoke these words to Arjuna whose eyes were tearful 
  and downcast, and who was overwhelmed with compassion and despair. (2.01)</P>
<P>Lord Krishna said: How has the dejection come to you at this juncture? This 
  is not fit for a person of noble mind and deeds. It is disgraceful, and it does 
  not lead one to heaven, O Arjuna. (2.02)</P>
<P>Do not become a coward, O Arjuna, because it does not befit you. Shake off 
  this trivial weakness of your heart and get up for the battle, O Arjuna. (2.03)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">ARJUNA CONTINUES HIS REASONING </FONT></I></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">AGAINST THE WAR </FONT></I></B></P>
<P>Arjuna said: How shall I strike my grandfather, my guru, and all other relatives, 
  who are worthy of my respect, with arrows in battle, O Krishna? (2.04)</P>
<P>It would be better, indeed, to live on alms in this world than to slay these 
  noble personalities, because by killing them I would enjoy wealth and pleasures 
  stained with their blood. (2.05)</P>
<P>We do not know which alternative <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> to fight or to 
  quit <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> is better for us. Further, we do not know 
  whether we shall conquer them or they will conquer us. We should not even wish 
  to live after killing our cousin brothers, who are standing in front of us. 
  (2.06)</P>
<P>My senses are overcome by the weakness of pity, and my mind is confused about 
  duty (Dharma). Please tell me what is better for me. I am Your disciple, and 
  I take refuge in You. (2.07)</P>
<P>I do not perceive that gaining an unrivaled and prosperous kingdom on this 
  earth, or even lordship over all the celestial controllers will remove the sorrow 
  that is drying up my senses. (2.08)</P>
<P>Sanjaya said: O King, after speaking like this to Lord Krishna, the mighty 
  Arjuna said to Krishna: I shall not fight, and became silent. (2.09)</P>
<P>O King, Lord Krishna, as if smiling, spoke these words to the distressed Arjuna 
  in the midst of the two armies. (2.10)</P>

<P>The contacts of the senses with the sense objects give rise to the feelings

  Therefore, one should learn to endure them. (2.14)</P>
<P>Because a calm person <FONT FACE="Symbol">¾</FONT> who is not afflicted by

<P>The Spirit by whom this entire universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one

<P>A yogi, seated in solitude and alone, should constantly try to contemplate 
  on a mental picture or just the majesty of the Supreme Being after bringing 
  the mind and senses under control, and becoming free from desires and proprietorship. 
  (6.10)</P>
<P>One should sit on his or her own firm seat that is neither too high nor too 
  low, covered with grass, a deerskin, and a cloth, one over the other, in a clean 
  spot. Sitting there in a comfortable position and concentrating the mind on 
  God, controlling the thoughts and the activities of the senses, one should practice 
  meditation for self-purification. (6.11-12)</P>
<P>One should sit by holding the waist, spine, chest, neck, and head erect, motionless 
  and steady; fix the eyes and the mind steadily on the front of the nose, without 
  looking around; make your mind serene and fearless, practice celibacy; have 
  the mind under control, think of Me, and have Me as the supreme goal. (See also 
  4.29, 5.27, 8.10, and 8.12) (6.13-14)</P>
<P>Thus, by always practicing to keep the mind fixed on Me, the yogi whose mind 
  is subdued attains peace of Nirvana and comes to Me. (6.15)</P>
<P>This yoga is not possible, O Arjuna, for the one who eats too much, or who 
  does not eat at all; who sleeps too much or too little. (6.16)</P>
<P>The yoga of meditation destroys all sorrow for the one who is moderate in eating, 
  recreation, working, sleeping, and waking. (6.17)</P>
<P>A person is said to have achieved yoga, the union with the Spirit, when the 
  perfectly disciplined mind becomes free from all desires, and gets completely 
  united with the Spirit in trance. (6.18)</P>
<P>A lamp in a spot sheltered by the Spirit from the wind of desires does not 
  flicker. This simile is used for the subdued mind of a yogi practicing meditation 
  on the Spirit. (6.19)</P>
<P>When the mind disciplined by the practice of meditation becomes steady, one 
  becomes content with the Spirit by beholding the Spirit of God with purified 
  intellect. (6.20)</P>
<P>One feels infinite bliss that is perceivable only through the intellect, and 
  is beyond the reach of the senses. After realizing the Absolute Reality, one 
  is never separated from it. (6.21)</P>
<P>After Self-realization (SR), one does not regard any other gain superior to 
  SR. Established in SR, one is not moved even by the greatest calamity. (6.22)</P>
<P>The state of severance of union with sorrow is called yoga. This yoga should 
  be practiced with firm determination, and without any mental reservation. (6.23)</P>
<P>One gradually attains tranquillity of mind by totally abandoning all selfish 
  desires, completely restraining the senses from the sense objects by the intellect, 
  and keeping the mind fully absorbed in the Spirit by means of a well-trained 
  and purified intellect and thinking of nothing else. (6.24-25)</P>

  FOUR GOALS OF HUMAN LIFE</FONT></I></B></P>
<P>The resolve by which one manipulates the functions of the mind, Prana (bioimpulses), 
  and senses for God-realization only; that resolve is in the mode of goodness, 
  O Arjuna. (18.33)</P>
<P>The resolve by which a person, craving for the fruits of work, clings to duty, 
  accumulating wealth, and enjoyment with great attachment; that resolve, O Arjuna, 
  is in the mode of passion. (18.34)</P>
<P>The resolve by which a dull person does not give up sleep, fear, grief, despair, 
  and carelessness; that resolve is in the mode of ignorance, O Arjuna. (18.35)</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">THREE TYPES OF PLEASURE </FONT></I></B></P>
<P>And now hear from Me, O Arjuna, about the threefold pleasure. The pleasure 
  one enjoys from spiritual practice results in cessation of all sorrows. (18.36)</P>
<P>The pleasure that appears as poison in the beginning, but is like nectar in 
  the end, comes by the grace of Self-knowledge, and is in the mode of goodness. 
  (18.37)</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Sensual pleasures appear as nectar in the beginning, 
  but become poison in the end; such pleasures are in the mode of passion. (See 
  also 5.22) (18.38)</FONT></B></P>
<P>Pleasure that confuses a person in the beginning and in the end; which comes 
  from sleep, laziness, and carelessness; such pleasure is said to be in the mode 
  of ignorance. (18.39)</P>
<P>There is no being, either on the earth or among the celestial controllers in 
  the heaven, who can remain free from these three modes of material Nature. (18.40)</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#ff00ff">ON ONE’S ABILITY</FONT></I></B></P>
<P>The division of human labor is also based on the qualities inherent in peoples’ 
  nature or their make up. (See also 4.13) (18.41)</P>
<P>Those who have serenity, self control, austerity, purity, patience, honesty, 
  transcendental knowledge, transcendental experience, and belief in God are labeled 
  as intellectuals (Braahmans). (18.42)</P>
<P>Those having the qualities of heroism, vigor, firmness, dexterity, not fleeing 
  from battle, charity, and administrative skills are called leaders or protectors 
  (Kshatriyas). (18.43)</P>
<P>Those who are good in cultivation, cattle rearing, business, trade, finance, 
  and industry are known as business men (Vaishyas). Those who are very good in 
  service and labor type work only are classed as workers (Shudras). (18.44)</P>

<P>One can attain the highest perfection by devotion to one’s natural work. Listen

<P>One’s inferior natural work is better than superior unnatural work even though 
  well performed. One who does the work ordained by one’s inherent nature, without 
  any selfish motive, incurs no sin (or Karmic reaction). (See also 3.35) (18.47)</P>
<P>One’s natural work, even though defective, should not be abandoned; because 
  all undertakings are enveloped by defects as fire is covered by smoke, O Arjuna. 
  (18.48)</P>
<P>The person whose mind is always free from selfish attachment, who has subdued 
  the mind and senses, and who is free from desires attains the supreme perfection 
  of freedom from the bondage of Karma by renouncing selfish attachment to the 
  fruits of work. (18.49)</P>
<P>Learn from Me briefly, O Arjuna, how one who has attained such perfection, 
  or the freedom from the bondage of Karma, attains Supreme Being, the goal of 
  transcendental knowledge. (18.50)</P>
<P>Endowed with purified intellect, subduing the mind with firm resolve, turning 
  away from sound and other objects of the senses, giving up likes and dislikes; 
  living in solitude, eating lightly, controlling the mind, speech, and organs 
  of action, ever absorbed in yoga of meditation, taking refuge in detachment; 
  and after relinquishing egotism, violence, pride, lust, anger, and proprietorship; 
  one becomes peaceful, free from the notion of "I, me, and my", and fit for attaining 
  oneness with the Supreme Being. (18.51-53)</P>
<P>Absorbed in the Supreme Being, the serene one neither grieves nor desires; 
  becoming impartial to all beings, one obtains the highest devotional love for 
  God. (18.54)</P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">By devotion one truly understands what and who I am

<P>If due to ego you think: I shall not fight; this resolve of yours is vain.

<P>O King, by repeated remembrance of this marvelous and sacred dialogue between
