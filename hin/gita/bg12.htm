</p>  <h1 align="center">CHAPTER XII<br> Of the Religion of Faith</h1>  
<p><i>Arjuna.</i> Lord! of the men who serve Thee- true in heart-<br> As God revealed; and of the men who serve,<br> Worshipping Thee Unrevealed, Unbodied, Far,<br> Which take the better way of faith and life?<br> Krishna. Whoever serve Me- as I show Myself-<br> Constantly true, in full devotion fixed,<br> Those hold I very holy. But who serve-<br> Worshipping Me The One, The Invisible,<br> The Unrevealed, Unnamed, Unthinkable,<br> Uttermost, All-pervading, Highest, Sure-<br> Who thus adore Me, mastering their sense,<br> Of one set mind to all, glad in all good,<br> These blessed souls come unto Me.<br> Yet, hard<br> The travail is for such as bend their minds<br> To reach th' Unmanifest. That viewless path<br> Shall scarce be trod by man bearing the flesh!<br> But whereso any doeth all his deeds<br> Renouncing self for Me, full of Me, fixed<br> To serve only the Highest, night and day<br> Musing on Me- him will I swiftly lift<br> Forth from life's ocean of distress and death,<br> Whose soul clings fast to Me. Cling thou to Me!<br> Clasp Me with heart and mind! so shalt thou dwell<br> Surely with Me on high. But if thy thought<br> Droops from such height; if thou be'st weak to set<br> Body and soul upon Me constantly,<br> Despair not! give Me lower service! I seek<br> To reach Me, worshipping with steadfast will;<br> And, if thou canst not worship steadfastly,<br> Work for Me, toil in works pleasing to Me!<br> For he that laboureth right for love of Me<br> Shall finally attain! But, if in this<br> Thy faint heart fails, bring Me thy failure! find<br> Refuge in Me! let fruits of labour go,<br> Renouncing hope for Me, with lowliest heart,<br> So shalt thou come; for, though to know is more<br> Than diligence, yet worship better is<br> Than knowing, and renouncing better still.<br> Near to renunciation- very near-<br> Dwelleth Eternal Peace!</p>  
<p>Who hateth nought<br> Of all which lives, living himself benign,<br> Compassionate, from arrogance exempt,<br> Exempt from love of self, unchangeable<br> By good or ill; patient, contented, firm<br> In faith, mastering himself, true to his word,<br> Seeking Me, heart and soul; vowed unto Me,-<br> That man I love! Who troubleth not his kind,<br> And is not troubled by them; clear of wrath,<br> Living too high for gladness, grief, or fear,<br> That man I love! Who, dwelling quiet-eyed,<br> Stainless, serene, well-balanced, unperplexed,<br> Working with Me, yet from all works detached,<br> That man I love! Who, fixed in faith on Me,<br> Dotes upon none, scorns none; rejoices not,<br> And grieves not, letting good or evil hap<br> Light when it will, and when it will depart,<br> That man I love! Who, unto friend and foe<br> Keeping an equal heart, with equal mind<br> Bears shame and glory; with an equal peace<br> Takes heat and cold, pleasure and pain; abides<br> Quit of desires, hears praise or calumny<br> In passionless restraint, unmoved by each;<br> Linked by no ties to earth, steadfast in Me,<br> That man I love! But most of all I love<br> Those happy ones to whom 'tis life to live<br> In single fervid faith and love unseeing,<br> Drinking the blessed Amrit of my Being!</p>  
<p>HERE ENDETH CHAPTER XII OF THE<br> BHAGAVAD-GITA,<br> Entitled "Bhaktiyog,"<br> Or "The Book of the Religion of Faith." </p>
