The Bhagavad Gita is technically part of [Book 6 of the
Mahabharata](../m06/index.md), although it is known to be a later accretion
to the saga, which stands on its own merits. It is a dialog between the
God Krishna and the hero Arjuna, taking place in a timeless moment on
the battlefield before the climactic struggle between good and evil. The
Gita (which can be found in hotel bedstands throughout India) is a
classic summary of the core beliefs of Hinduism. It has had a
significant influence far beyond Hinduism. Robert Oppenheimer
apocryphically recited the verse (from [Chapter 11](bg11).md) 'I \[have
become\] Death, Destroyer of Worlds", just before the first test of the
atom bomb, which ironically has a much different meaning in context.

This has now been cross-referenced with the [Sanskrit
text](../bgs/index.md).
