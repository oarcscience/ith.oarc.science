### HYMN I

#### The glorification of Rohita, a form of Fire and of the Sun

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300101">1</span></span>Rise, Mighty
One, who liest in the waters, and enter this thy  
   fair and glorious kingdom.  
  Let Rohita who made this All uphold thee carefully nurtured  
   for supreme dominion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300102">2</span></span>The strength
that was in waters hath ascended. Mount o'er the  
   tribes which thou hast generated.  
  Creating Soma, waters, plants and cattle, bring hitherward both  
   quadrupeds and bipeds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300103">3</span></span>Ye Maruts,
strong and mighty, sons of Prisni, with Indra for  
   ally crush down our foemen.  
  Let Rohita, ye bounteous givers, hear you, thrice-seven Maruts  
   who delight in sweetness!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300104">4</span></span>Up to the
lap of births, to lofty places, hath Rohita, the germ  
   of Dames, ascended.  
  Conjoined with these he found the six realms: seeing his way  
   in front here he received the kingship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300105">5</span></span>For thee
hath Rohita obtained dominion, scattered thine ene-  
   mies, become thy safeguard.  
  So by the potent Sakvaris let Heaven and Earth be milked to-  
    yield thee all thy wishes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300106">6</span></span>Rohita gave
the Earth and Heavens their being. There Para-  
   meshthin held the cord extended.  
  Thereon reposeth Aja Ekapāda. He with his might hath stab-  
   lished Earth and Heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300107">7</span></span>Rohita
firmly stablished Earth and Heaven: by him was ether  
   fixt by him the welkin.  
  He measured out mid air and all the regions: by him the Gods  
   found life that lasts for ever.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300108">8</span></span>Arranging
shoots, springs, Rohita considered this Universe in  
   all its forms and phases.  
  May he, gone up to heaven with mighty glory, anoint thy sov-  
   ranty with milk and fatness. <span id="page_108">p. 108</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300109">9</span></span>Thy risings
up, thy mountings and ascensions wherewith thou  
   fillest heaven and air's mid-region—  
  By prayer for these, by milk of these, increasing, in Rohita's  
   kingdom watch, among his people.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300110">10</span></span>The tribes
thy heat produced have followed hither the Calf and  
  Gāyatri, the strain that lauds him.  
  With friendly heart let them approach to serve thee, and the  
  Calf Rohita come with his mother.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300111">11</span></span>Erected,
Rohita hath reached the welkin, wise, young, creating  
   every form and figure.  
  Agni, refulgent with his heightened lustre, in the third realm  
   hath brought us joy and gladness.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1300112">12</span></span>Thousand-horned Bull, may Jātavedas,
worshipped with butter,  
   balmed with Soma, rich in heroes,  
  Besought, ne'er quit me; may I ne'er forsake thee. Give me  
   abundant men and herds of cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300113">13</span></span>Rohita is
the sire and mouth of worship: to him with voice, ear,  
   heart I pay oblation.  
  To Rohita come Gods with joyful spirit. May he by risings raise  
   me till I join him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300114">14</span></span>Rohita
ordered sacrifice for Visvakarman: thence have I obta-  
   ined this strength and energy.  
  May I proclaim thee as my kin over the greatness of the world.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300115">15</span></span>On thee
have mounted Brihatī and Pankti. and Kakup with great  
   splendour, Jātavedas!  
  The cry of Vashat with the voice uplifted and Rohita with seed  
   on thee have mounted.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300116">16</span></span>He goes
into the womb of earth, he robes himself in heaven and  
   air.  
  He on the Bright One's station hath reached heavenly light and  
   all the worlds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300117">17</span></span>To us,
Vāchaspati, may Earth be pleasant, pleasant our dwelling,  
   pleasant be our couches.  
  Even here may Prāna be our friend: may Agni, O Parameshthin  
   give thee life and splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300118">18</span></span>And those,
Vāchaspati, our own five seasons, sacred to Visva-  
   karman their creator.  
  Even here our friend be Prāna: Parameshthin, may Rohita  
   vouchsafe the life and splendour. <span id="page_109">p. 109</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300119">19</span></span>Breed, O
Vāchaspati, joy and understanding, kine i n our stall  
   and children in our consorts.  
  Even here may Prāna be our friend: may Agni, O Parameshthin,  
   give thee life and splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300120">20</span></span>With
splendour let God Savitar, and Agni, with splendour  
  Mitra, Varuna invest thee.  
  Treading down all Malignities, come hither. Pleasant and'  
   glorious hast thou made this kingdom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300121">21</span></span>Rohita,
car-borne by a speckled leader, thou, pouring water,.  
   goest on in triumph.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300122">22</span></span>Golden,
refulgent, lofty is the Lady, Rohinī, Rohita's devoted  
  Consort.  
  Through her may we win various spoil and booty, through her  
   be conquerors in every battle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300123">23</span></span>Rohita's
seat is Rohinī before us: that is the path the speckled  
  Mare pursueth.  
  Kasyapas and Gandharvas lead her upward, and heavenly sages  
   ever watch and guard her,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300124">24</span></span>Sūrya's bay
steeds refulgent and immortal draw the light-rolling.  
   chariot on for ever.  
  Drinker of fatness, Rohita, resplendent, hath entered into  
   various-coloured heaven,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300125">25</span></span>Rohita,
Bull whose horns are sharply pointed, superior of Agni  
   and of Sūrya,  
  He who supports the sundered earth and heaven,—from him the  
  Gods effect their own creations.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300126">26</span></span>Rohita rose
to heaven from mighty ocean, Rohita rose and  
   clomb all steeps and rises.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300127">27</span></span>Prepare the
Milky One who teems with fatness: she is the Gods'  
   never-reluctant milch-cow.  
  Indra drink Soma: ours be peace and safety. Let Agni lead the  
   laud, and chase our foemen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300128">28</span></span>Both
kindling and inflamed, adored with butter and enhanced  
   thereby.  
  May conquering Agni, conqueror of all, destroy mine enemies.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300129">29</span></span>Let him
smite down in death and burn the foeman who  
   attacketh me.  
  Our adversaries we consume through Agni the Carnivorous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300130">30</span></span>Beat them
down, Indra, with thy bolt, beat them down, mighty  
   with thine arm. <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>  
  I through the energy and force of Agni have secured my foes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300131">31</span></span>Cast down
our foes beneath our feet, O Agni. Brihaspati,  
   oppress our rebel kinsman.  
  Low let them fall, O Indra-Agni. Mitra-Varuna, powerless to  
   show their anger.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300132">32</span></span>Ascending
up on high, O God. O Sūrya, drive my foes away.  
  Yea, beat them backward with the stone: to deepest darkness  
   let them go.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300133">33</span></span>Calf of
Virāj, the Bull of prayers and worship, whitebacked, he  
   hath gone up to air's mid-region.  
  Singing, they hymn the Calf, with gifts of butter: him who is  
  Brahma they exalt with Brahma.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300134">34</span></span>Rise up to
earth, rise up to heaven above it; rise up to opulence,  
   rise up to kingship.  
  Rise up to offspring, rise to life immortal; rise, and with Rohita  
   unite thy body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300135">35</span></span>With all
the Gods who circle round the Sun, upholding royal  
   sway,  
  With all of these may Rohita accordant, give sovranty to thee  
   with friendly spirit.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300136">36</span></span>Cleansed by
prayer, sacrifices bear thee upward: bay coursers,  
   ever travelling, convey thee. Thy light shines over sea and  
   billowy ocean.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300137">37</span></span>Rohita,
conqueror of cows and riches and gathered spoil, is  
   heaven's and earth's upholder.  
  Over earth's greatness would I tell my kinship with thee who  
   hast a thousand births and seven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300138">38</span></span>A glorious
sight to beasts and men, thou goest glorious to the  
   regions and mid-regions.  
  On earth's, on Aditi's bosom, bright with glory. Fain would I  
   equal Savitar in beauty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300139">39</span></span>Thou,
yonder, knowest all things here, when here thou knowest  
   what is there.  
  From here men see the sphere of light, Sūrya profoundly wise in  
   heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300140">40</span></span>A God, thou
injurest the Gods: thou movest in the ocean's  
   depth.  
  Men kindle common Agni: him only the higher sages know.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300141">41</span></span>Beneath the
upper realm, above this lower, bearing her Calf at  
   foot, the Cow hath risen <span id="page_111">p. 111</span>  
  Whitherward, to what place hath she departed? Where doth she  
   calve? Not in this herd of cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300142">42</span></span>She hath
become one-footed or two-footed, four-footed, or  
   eight-footed or nine-footed,  
  This universe's thousand-syllabled Pankti Oceans flow forth  
   from her in all directions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300143">43</span></span>Rising to
heaven, immortal, hear my calling. Cleansed by  
   prayer, sacrifices bear thee upward. Bay coursers, ever on the  
   road, convey thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300144">44</span></span>This, O
Immortal One, I know of thee, thy progress to the sky  
   thy dwelling-place in loftiest heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300145">45</span></span>Beyond the
sky, beyond the Earth looks Sūrya, and beyond the  
   floods.  
  The single eye of all that is; to mighty heaven hath he arisen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300146">46</span></span>The earth
was made his altar, and the wide expanses were the  
   fence.  
  There Rohita established both these Agnis, fervent heat and  
   cold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300147">47</span></span>He
stablished heat and cold, he made the mountains sacrificial  
   posts.  
  Then both the Agnis, Rohita's who found celestial light, with  
   rain for molten butter, sacrificed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300148">48</span></span>Rohita's
Agni-his who found heaven's light-is kindled with the  
   prayer.  
  From him the heat, from him the cold, from him the sacrifice  
   was born.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300149">49</span></span>Both
Agins-Rohita's who found the light of heaven—made  
   strong by prayer,  
  Waxing by prayer, adored with prayer, by prayer enkindled,  
   sacrificed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300150">50</span></span>One is
deposited in Truth, one kindled in the waters: both  
  Agnis of Rohita who found the light are set aflame with prayer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300151">51</span></span>That decked
by Wind, and that prepared by Indra Brāhman-  
   aspati,  
  Agnis of Rohita who found light, prayer-enkindled, sacrificed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300152">52</span></span>Rohita made
the earth to be his altar, heaven his Dakshinā.  
  Then heat he took for Agni, and with rain for molten butter he  
   created every living thing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300153">53</span></span>The earth
became an altar, heat was Agni, and the butter rain. <span
id="page_112">p. 112</span>  
  There Agni made, by song and hymn, these mountains rise and  
   stand erect.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300154">54</span></span>Then,
having made the hills stand up, Rohita spake to Earth,  
   and said:  
  In thee let every thing be born, what is and what is yet to be.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300155">55</span></span>This
sacrifice, the first of all, the past, the present, had its birth.  
  From that arose this universe, yea, all this world of brightness,  
   brought by Rohita the heavenly Sage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300156">56</span></span>If thou
should kick a cow, or by indecent act offend the Sun,  
  Thy root I sever; nevermore mayst thou cast shadow on the  
   ground.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300157">57</span></span>Thou who,
between the fire and me, passest across the line of  
   shade.  
  Thy root I sever: nevermore mayst thou cast shadow on the  
   ground.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300158">58</span></span>Whoe'er he
be who, Sūrya, God! comes between thee and me  
   to-day,  
  On him we wipe away ill-dream, and troubles, and impurity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300159">59</span></span>Let us not,
Indra, leave the path, the Soma-presser's sacrifice.  
  Let not malignities dwell with us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300160">60</span></span>May we
obtain, completely wrought, the thread spun out tc  
   reach the Gods,  
  That perfecteth our sacrifice.
