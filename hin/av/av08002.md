### HYMN II

#### The same

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800201">1</span></span>Seize to
thyself this trust of life for ever: thine be longevity  
   which nothing shortens.  
  Thy spirit and thy life again I bring thee: die not, nor vanish  
   into mist and darkness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800202">2</span></span>Come to the
light of living men, come hither: I draw thee to a  
   life of hundred autumns.  
  Loosing the bonds of Death, the curse that holds thee, I give thee  
   age of very long duration.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800203">3</span></span>Thy breath
have I recovered from the Wind, thy vision from the  
  Sun.  
  Thy mind I stablish and secure within thee: feel in thy members,.  
   use thy tongue, conversing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800204">4</span></span>I blow upon
thee with the breath of bipeds and quadrupeds, as  
   on a fire new-kindled.  
  To thee, O Death, and to thy sight and breath have I paid  
   reverence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800205">5</span></span>Let this man
live, let him not die: we raise him, we recover him.  
  I make for him a healing balm. O Death, forbear to slay this  
   man. <span id="page_a325">p. a325</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800206">6</span></span>Here for
sound health I invocate a living animating plant,  
  Preserving, queller of disease, victorious, full of power and  
   might.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800207">7</span></span>Seize him
not, but encourage and release him: here let him stay,  
   though thine, in all his vigour.  
  Bhava and Sarva, pity and protect him: give him full life and  
   drive away misfortunes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800208">8</span></span>Comfort him,
Death, and pity him: let him arise and pass away,  
  Unharmed, with all his members, hearing well, with old, may he  
   through hundred years win profit with his soul.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800209">9</span></span>May the
Gods' missile pass thee by. I bring thee safe from the  
   mist: from death have I preserved thee.  
  Far have I banished flesh-consuming Agni: I place a rampart  
   for thy life's protection.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800210">10</span></span>Saving him
from that misty path of thine which cannot be  
   defined.  
  From that descent of thine, O Death, we make for him a shield  
   of prayer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800211">11</span></span>I give thee
both the acts of breath, health, lengthened life, and  
   death by age.  
  All Yama's messengers who roam around, sent by Vaivasvata,  
  I chase away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800212">12</span></span>Far off we
drive Malignity, Destruction, Pisāchas banqueters on  
   flesh, and Grāhi.  
  And all the demon kind, the brood of sin, like darkness, we  
   dispel.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800213">13</span></span>I win thy
life from Agni, from the living everlasting Jātavedas.  
  This I procure for thee, that thou, undying, mayst not suffer  
   harm, that thou mayst be content, that all be well with thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800214">14</span></span>Gracious to
thee be Heaven and Earth, bringing no grief, and  
   drawing nigh!  
  Pleasantly shine the Sun for thee, the Wind blow sweetly to  
   thy heart!  
  Let the celestial Waters full of milk flow happily for thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800215">15</span></span>Auspicious
be the Plants to thee! I have upraised thee, borne  
   thee from the lower to the upper earth:  
  Let the two Sons of Aditi, the Sun and Moon, protect thee there.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800216">16</span></span>Whatever
robe to cover thee or zone thou makest for thyself,  
  We make it pleasant to thy frame: may it be soft and smooth  
   to touch. <span id="page_a326">p. a326</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800217">17</span></span>When, with
a very keen and cleasing razor, our hair and beards  
   thou shavest as a barber,  
  Smoothing our face steal not our vital forces.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800218">18</span></span>Auspicious
unto thee be rice and barley, causing no painful sick-  
   ness or consumption, these deliver from calamity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800219">19</span></span>Thy food,
thy drink, whate'er they be corn grown by cultivation,  
   milk,  
  Food eatable, uneatable, I make all poisonless for thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800220">20</span></span>We give
thee over as a charge to Day and Night, in trust to  
   both.  
  Keep him for me from stingy fiends, from those who fain would  
   feed on him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800221">21</span></span>A hundred,
yea, ten thousand years we give thee, ages two,  
   three, four.  
  May Indra, Agni, all the Gods, with willing favour look on thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800222">22</span></span>To Autumn
we deliver thee, to Winter, Spring and Summer's  
   care.  
  We trust thee with auspicious years wherein the plants and herbs  
   grow up.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800223">23</span></span>Death is
the lord of bipeds, Death is sovran lord of quadrupeds.  
  Away I bear thee from that: Death the ruler: be not thou  
   afraid.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800224">24</span></span>Thou, still
uninjured, shalt not die: be not afraid; thou shalt  
   not die.  
  Here where I am men do not die or go to lowest depths of  
   gloom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800225">25</span></span>Here verily
all creatures live, the cow, the horse, the man, the  
   beast,  
  Here where this holy prayer is used, a rampart that protecteth  
   life.  
  Let it preserve thee from thy peers, from incantation, from thy  
   friends.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800226">26</span></span>Live very
long, be healthy, be immortal: let not the vital breath  
   forsake thy body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800227">27</span></span>One and a
hundred modes of death, dangers that may be over-  
   come,  
  May Gods deliver thee from this when Agni, dear to all men,  
   bids.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800228">28</span></span>Body of
Agni prompt to save, slayer of fiends and foes art thou,  
  Yea, banisher of malady, the healing balm called Pūtudru.
