### HYMN XXVII

#### A benedictory hymn

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902701">1</span></span>Let the Bull
guard thee with the kine, the Stallien with the fleet-  
   foot steeds. <span id="page_233">p. 233</span>  
  Let Vāyu keep thee safe with prayer, and Indra with his mighty  
   power.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902702">2</span></span>Let Soma
guard thee with the plants, Sūrya protect thee with  
   the stars;  
  With breath let Wind protect thee, and the Moon, foe-slayer,  
   with the months.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902703">3</span></span>Three are
the earths, they say, and three the heavens, three are  
   the atmospheres, and four the oceans.  
  Threefold the hymn of praise, threefold the Waters. Let these  
   with triple song and triplets guard thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902704">4</span></span>Three vaults
of heaven, and three seas, three bright, three  
   stationary ones,  
  Three Mātarisvans, and three suns, protectors, I arrange for  
   thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902705">5</span></span>Increasing
thee with butter I, Agni! with fatness sprinkle thee.  
  Let not magicians harm the life of Agni or of Moon or Sun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902706">6</span></span> Let not
magicians mar your heat, your vital or diffusive breath.  
  Brilliant and all-possessing Gods, run ye your course with God-  
   like power.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902707">7</span></span>Fire they
endow with vital breath, Wind is compact, with vital  
   breath:  
  With vital breath the Gods produced the Sun whose face turn  
   every way.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902708">8</span></span>Live with
the Life-Creators' life. Die not, live on to lengthened  
   age.  
  Live with the breath of men with souls. Submit not to the power  
   of Death.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902709">9</span></span>The secret
treasure of the Gods which Indra, by pathways  
   travelled by the Gods, discovered,  
  That gold the Waters with the triplets guarded. May they keep  
   thee with threebold hymn and triplets.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902710">10</span></span>With
friendly thoughts the Deities, three-and thirty, and three  
   great Powers preserved it in the Waters.  
  He made heroic powers with the gold that lies upon this Moon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902711">11</span></span>O ye eleven
Gods who are in heaven, accept this sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902712">12</span></span>O ye eleven
Gods who are in air, accept this sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902713">13</span></span>O ye eleven
Gods who are on earth, accept this sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902714">14</span></span>15 repeated
from XIX. 16. 1, 2.
