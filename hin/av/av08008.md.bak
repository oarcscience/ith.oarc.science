### HYMN VIII

#### Imprecations directed against a hostile army

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800801">1</span></span>Indra the
Shaker shake them up, brave, hero, fortdemolisher,  
  That into thousand fragments we may strike the armies of our  
   foes!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800802">2</span></span>Let
Pūtirajju with her breath corrupt and putrefy that host,  
  And terror smite our foemen's heart when fire and smoke are  
   seen afar.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800803">3</span></span>Asvattha,
rend those men; do thou devour them quickly,  
  Khadira!  
  Like reeds let them be broken through, down-smitten by a lifted  
   rush.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800804">4</span></span>Let
Parushāhva make them reeds, and let the bulrush strike  
   them down:  
  Bound in a mighty net let them break quickly like an arrow's  
   shaft.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800805">5</span></span>Air was the
net; the poles thereof were the great quarters of the  
   sky: <span id="page_a344">p. a344</span>  
  Sakra therewith enveloped and cast on the ground the Dasyus'  
   host.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800806">6</span></span>Verily
mighty is the net of mighty Sakra rich in wealth:  
  Therewith press all the foemen down so that not one of them  
   escape!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800807">7</span></span>Great is thy
net, brave Indra, thine the mighty match for a  
   thousand, Lord of Hundred Powers!  
  Holding them, with his host, therewith hath Indra slaughtered  
  Dasyus a hundred, thousand, myriad, hundred millions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800808">8</span></span>This world
so mighty was the net of Sakra, of the Mighty One:  
  With this, the net of Indra, I envelop all those men with gloom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800809">9</span></span>Great
weakness and misfortune, pain which words can never  
   charm away,  
  Languor, fatigue, bewilderment, with these I compass all the  
   foes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800810">10</span></span>I give
those foemen up to Death: bound in the bonds of Death  
   are they.  
  I bind and carry them away to meet Death's wicked messengers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800811">11</span></span>Bear them
away, Death's messengers! envoys of Yama! bind  
   them fast.  
  More than a thousand be their slain: the club of Bhava pierce  
   them through!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800812">12</span></span>Forth go
the Sādhyas in their might bearing one netpole raised  
   aloft.  
  One pole the Rudras carry, one the Vasus, and the Ādityas one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800813">13</span></span>The Visve
Devas from above shall come depressing it with  
   might,  
  And in the midst the Angirases, slaying the mighty host, shall go.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800814">14</span></span>Trees of
the forest, trees that bear flower and fruit, and herbs  
   and plants,  
  Quadruped, biped send I forth that they may strike this army  
   dead,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800815">15</span></span>Gandharvas,
and Apsarases, Gods, Serpents, Fathers, Holy  
  Men,  
  Seen and unseen, I send them forth that they may strike this  
   army dead.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800816">16</span></span>Here spread
are snares of Death wherefrom thou, once within  
   them, ne'er art freed:  
  Full many a thousand of the host yonder this horn shall smite  
   and slay. <span id="page_a345">p. a345</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800817">17</span></span>The Gharma
hath been warmed with fire: this Homa slays a  
   thousand men.  
  Let Bhava, Prisnibāhu, and Sarva destroy that armament.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800818">18</span></span>Their
portion be the fire of Death, hunger, exhaustion, slaughter,  
   fear.  
  With your entangling snares and nets, Sarva and Indra! slay that  
   host.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800819">19</span></span>Fly,
conquered, in alarm, ye foes, run driven by the spell away!  
  Let not one man escape of those when routed by Brihaspati.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800820">20</span></span>Down fall
their weapons on the ground: no strength be theirs  
   to point a shaft:  
  Then in their dreadful terror let their arrows wound their vital  
   parts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800821">21</span></span>Let Heaven
and Earth roar out in wrath against them, and Air  
   with all the Deities in concert,  
  Let them not find a surety or a refuge, but torn away go down  
   to Death together.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800822">22</span></span>The mules
of the Gods' car are heaven's four quarters; their  
   hooves are sacred cakes, the air its body.  
  Its sides are Heaven and Earth, its reins the Seasons, Voice is its  
   hood, its grooms are sky's mid-regions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800823">23</span></span>Year is the
car, Full Year the seat for driving, Virāj the pole,  
   the chariot's front is Agni, Indra the warrior, and the Moon  
   the driver.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800824">24</span></span>Hence
conquer, conquer, Hail! be thou the victor! Let these be  
   conquerors and those be conquered.  
  Good luck to these, ill luck to those men yonder! With the  
   dark-blue-and-red our foes I cover.
