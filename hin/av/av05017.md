### HYMN XVII

#### The abduction and restoration of a Brāhman's wife

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501701">1</span></span>These first,
the boundless Sea, and Mātarisvan, fierce glowing  
  Fire, the Strong, the Bliss-bestower,  
  And heavenly Floods, first-born by holy Order, exclaimed  
   against the outrage on a Brāhman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501702">2</span></span>King Soma
first of all, without reluctance, made restitution of  
   the Brāhman's consort.  
  Mitra and Varuna were the inviters: Agni as Hotar took her  
   hand and led her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501703">3</span></span>The man, her
pledge, must by the hand be taken when he hath  
   cried, She is a Brāhman's consort.  
  She stayed not for a herald to conduct her: thus is the kingdom  
   of a ruler guarded.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501704">4</span></span>She whom
they call the star with loosened tresses, descending as.  
   misfortune on the village, <span id="page_a174">p. a174</span>  
  The Brāhman's consort, she disturbs the kingdom where hath  
   appeared the hare with fiery flashing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501705">5</span></span>Active in
duty serves the Brahmachāri: he is a member of the  
  Gods' own body.  
  Through him Brihaspati obtained his consort, as the Gods gained  
   the ladle brought by Soma.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501706">6</span></span>Thus spake
of her those Gods of old, Seven Rishis, who sate  
   them down to their austere devotion:  
  Dire is a Brāhman's wife led home by others: in the supremest  
   heaven she plants confusion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501707">7</span></span>When infants
die, untimely born, when herds of cattle waste  
   away,  
  When heroes strike each other dead, the Brāhman's wife  
   destroyeth them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501708">8</span></span>Even if ten
former husbands—none a Brāhman—had espoused a  
   dame,  
  And then a Brāhman took her hand, he is her husband, only he,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501709">9</span></span>Not Vaisya,
not Rājanya, no, the Brāhman is indeed her lord:  
  This Sūrya in his course proclaims to the Five Races of man-  
   kind.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501710">10</span></span>So then the
Gods restored her, so men gave the woman back  
   again.  
  Princes who kept their promises restored the Brāhman's wedded  
   wife.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501711">11</span></span>Having
restored the Brāhman's wife, and freed them, with Gods'  
   aid, from sin,  
  They shared the fulness of the earth and worn themselves ex-  
   tended sway.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501712">12</span></span>No lovely
wife who brings her dower in hundreds rests upon his  
   bed,  
  Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a  
  Brāhman's dame.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501713">13</span></span>No
broad-browed calf with wide-set ears is ever in his homestead  
   born.  
  Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a  
  Brāhman's dame.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501714">14</span></span>No steward,
golden-necklaced, goes before the meat-trays of the  
   man.  
  Within whose kingdom is detained, through want of sense, a  
  Brāhman's dame. <span id="page_a175">p. a175</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501715">15</span></span>No
black-eared courser, white of hue, moves proudly, harnessed  
   to his car,  
  In whose dominion is detained, through want of sense, a  
  Brāhman's dame.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501716">16</span></span>No lily
grows with oval bulbs, no lotus-pool is in his field,  
  In whose dominion is detained, through senseless love, a  
  Brāhman's dame.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501717">17</span></span>The men
whose task it is to milk drain not the brindled cow for  
   him,  
  In whose dominion is detained, through senseless love, a  
  Brāhman's dame.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501718">18</span></span>His
milch-cow doth not profit one, his draught-ox masters not  
   the yoke,  
  Wherever, severed from his wife, a Brāhman spends the mourn-  
   ful night.
