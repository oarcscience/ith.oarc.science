### HYMN LII

#### A charm against noxious reptiles and insects

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0605201">1</span></span>Slaying the
Rākshasas, the Sun mounts upward in the front of  
   heaven,  
  Āditya, from the mountains, seen of all, destroying things  
   unseen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0605202">2</span></span>The kine had
settled in their pen, wild animals sought their lairs  
  The wavelets of the brooks had passed away, and were beheld  
   no more.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0605203">3</span></span>I have
brought Kanva's famous Plant, life-giving, and itself  
   inspired,  
  The medicine that healeth all: may it suppress my hidden foes.
