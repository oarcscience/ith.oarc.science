### HYMN XCVI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009601">1</span></span>Taste this
strong draught that gives thee vital vigour: with all  
   thy chariot here unyoke thy coursers.  
  Let not those other sacrificers stay thee, Indra: these juices shed  
   for thee are ready.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009602">2</span></span>Thine is the
juice effused, thine are the juices yet to be pressed:  
   our resonant songs invite thee.  
  O Indra, pleased to-day with this libation, come, thou who  
   knowest all, and drink the Soma.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009603">3</span></span>Whoso,
devoted to the God, effuses Soma for him with yearning  
   heart and spirit,  
  Never doth Indra give away his cattle: for him he makes the  
   lovely Soma famous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009604">4</span></span>He looks
with loving favour on the mortal who, like a rich man,  
   pours for him the Soma.  
  Maghavan in his bended arm supports him: he slays, unasked,  
   the men who hate devotion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009605">5</span></span>We call on
thee to come to us, desirous of booty, and of cattle,  
   and of horses. <span id="page_344">p. 344</span>  
  For thy new love and favour are we present: let us invoke thee,  
  Indra, as our welfare.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009606">6</span></span>For life I
set thee free by this oblation from the unknown  
   decline and from consumption;  
  Or, if the grasping demon have possessed him, free him from  
   her, O Indra, thou and Agni.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009607">7</span></span>Be his days
ended, be he how departed, be he brought very near  
   to death already,  
  Out of Destruction's lap again I bring him, save him for life to  
   last a hundred autumns.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009608">8</span></span>With
thousand-eyed oblation, hundred-autumned, bringing a  
   hundred lives, have 1 restored him.  
  That Indra for a hundred years may lead him safe to the farther  
   shore of all misfortune.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009609">9</span></span>Live waxing
in thy strength a hundred autumns, live through a  
   hundred springs, a hundred winters.  
  Through hundred-lived oblation Indra, Agni, Brihaspati, Savitar  
   yield him for a hundred!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009610">10</span></span>So have I
found and rescued thee: thou hast returned with  
   youth renewed.  
  Whole in thy members! I have found whole sight and all thy  
   life for thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009611">11</span></span>May Agni
yielding to our prayer, the Rakshas-killer, drive away.  
  The malady of evil name that hath beset thy labouring womb.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009612">12</span></span>Agni,
concurring in the prayer, drive off the eater of thy flesh,  
  The malady of evil name that hath attacked thy babe and  
   womb.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009613">13</span></span>That which
destroys the sinking germ, the settled, moving  
   embryo,  
  That which would kill the babe at birth, even this will we drive  
   far away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009614">14</span></span>That which
divides thy legs that it may lie between the married  
   pair,  
  That penetrates and licks thy side, even this will we exterminate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009615">15</span></span>What rests
by thee in borrowed form of brother, lover, or of  
   lord,  
  And would destroyed the progeny,—even this will we exter-  
   minate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009616">16</span></span>That which
through sleep or darkness hath deceived thee and  
   lies down by thee, <span id="page_345">p. 345</span>  
  And will destroy thy progeny,—even this will we exterminate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009617">17</span></span>From both
thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears  
   and from thy chin,  
  Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady  
   away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009618">18</span></span>From the
neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones  
   and from the spine,  
  From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009619">19</span></span>From
viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the  
   heart,  
  From kidneys, liver and from spleen, I drive thy malady away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009620">20</span></span>From
thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the  
   forepart of the feet,  
  From hips, from stomach, and from groin, I drive thy malady  
   away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009621">21</span></span>From what
is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from  
   thy nails,  
  From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009622">22</span></span>From every
member, every hair, disease that comes in every  
   joint,  
  From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009623">23</span></span>Avaunt,
thou Master of the Mind, I Depart and vanish far away.  
  Look on Destruction far from us. The live man's mind is  
   manifold.
