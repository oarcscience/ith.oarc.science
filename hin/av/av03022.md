### HYMN XXII

#### The taming and training of an elephant for a king to ride on

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302201">1</span></span>Famed be the
Elephant's strength, the lofty glory, which out of  
  Aditi's body took existence!  
  They all have given me this for my possession, even all the Gods  
   and Aditi accordant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302202">2</span></span>On this have
Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Rudra fixed their  
   thought.  
  May those all-fostering deities anoint and balm me with his  
   strength.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302203">3</span></span>The strength
wherewith the Elephant was dowered, that decks a  
  King among the men, in waters,  
  O Agni, even with that strength make thou me vigorous to-day.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302204">4</span></span>The lofty
strength which sacrifice brings, Jātavedas! unto thee,  
  What strength the Sun possesses, all strength of the royal Ele-  
   phant—such strength vouchsafe to me the pair of Asvins  
   lotus-garlanded!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302205">5</span></span>Far as the
heaven's four regions spread, far as the eye's most  
   distant ken.  
  So wide, so vast let power be mine, this vigour of the Elephant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302206">6</span></span>Now hath the
Elephant become chief of all pleasant beasts to  
   ride.  
  With his high fortune and his strength I grace and conscorate  
   myself.
