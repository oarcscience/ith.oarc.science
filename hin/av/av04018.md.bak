### HYMN XVIII

#### A counter-charm against the incantations of enemies

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401801">1</span></span>The
moonlight equalleth the sun, night is the rival of the day.  
  I make effectual power my help: let magic arts be impotent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401802">2</span></span>Gods! if one
make and bring a spell on some man's house who  
   knows it not,  
  Close as the calf that sucks the cow may it revert and cling to  
   him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401803">3</span></span>When one
puts poison in a dish of unbaked clay to kill a man,  
  It cracks when set upon the fire with the sharp sound of many  
   stones.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401804">4</span></span>Endowed with
thousand powers! adjure the bald and those with  
   necks awry.  
  Back to its author turn the spell like a dear damsel to her  
   friend!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401805">5</span></span>I with this
Plant have ruined all malignant powers of witchery.  
  The spell which they have laid upon thy field, thy cattle, or thy  
   men.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401806">6</span></span>No power had
he who wrought the spell: he hurt his foot, he  
   broke his toe.  
  His act hath brought us happiness and pain and sorrow to him-  
   self.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401807">7</span></span>Let Apāmārga
sweep away chronic disease and every curse,  
  Sweep sorceresses clean away, and all malignant stingy hags.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401808">8</span></span>Sweep thou
away the sorcerers, all stingy fiendish hags away.  
  All this, O Apāmārga, with thine aid we wipe away from us.
