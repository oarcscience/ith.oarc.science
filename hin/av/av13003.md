engendered these, the earth and heaven, who made the  
   worlds the mantle that he weareth,  
  In whom abide the six wide-spreading regions through which the  
  Bird's keen vision penetrateth,  
  This God is wroth offended by the sinner who wrongs the  
  Brāhman who hath gained this knowledge  
  Agitate him, O Rohita; destroy him: entangle in thy snares the  
  Brāman's tyrant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300302">2</span></span>He from whom
winds blow pure in ordered season, from whom  
   the seas flow forth in all directions, <span id="page_121">p.
121</span>  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300303">3</span></span>He who takes
life away, he who bestows it; from whom comes  
   breath to every living creature,  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300304">4</span></span>Who with the
breath he draws sates earth and heaven, with  
   expiration fills the ocean's belly,  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300305">5</span></span>In whom
Virāj, Prajāpati, Parameshthin, Agni Vaisvānara abide  
   with Pankti,  
  He who hath taken to himself the breathing of the Supreme, the  
   vigour of the Highest,  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300306">6</span></span>On whom rest
six expenses and five regions, four waters, and  
   three syllables of worship,  
  He who hath looked between both spheres in anger,  
  This God, etc.

  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300308">8</span></span>He who metes

   and nights, containing thirty members,  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300309">9</span></span>Dark the
descent; the strong-winged birds are golden: they fly  
   aloft to heaven, enrobed in waters.  
  They have come hither from the seat of Order,  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300310">10</span></span>What
silver. Kasyapa, thou hast refulgent, what brightly-shining  
   lotus-flower collected,  
  Wherein are gathered seven Suns together,  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300311">11</span></span>In front
the Brihat-Sāman is his mantle, and from behind  
  Rathantara enfolds him,  
  Ever with care robing themselves in splendour.  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300312">12</span></span>One of his
wings was Brihat, and the other Rathantarr., vigorous  
   with one same purpose,  
  What time the Gods gave Rohita his being.  
  This God, etc. <span id="page_122">p. 122</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300313">13</span></span>At evening
he is Varuna and Agni, ascending in the morning he  
   is Mitra.  
  As Savitar, he moves through air's mid region, as Indra warms-  
   the heavens from the centre.  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300314">14</span></span>This
gold-hued Harisa's wings, soaring to heaven spread o'er a  
   thousand days' continued journey.  
  Supporting all the Gods upon his bosom, he goes his way behol-  
   ding every creature.  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300315">15</span></span>This is the
God who dwells-within the waters, the thousand-  
   rooted, many-powered Atri,  
  He who brought all this world into existence.  
  This God; etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300316">16</span></span>With flying
feet his tawny coursers carry the bright God through,  
   the sky, aglow with splendour.  
  Whose limbs uplifted fire and heat the heavens: hither he shines-  
   with beams of golden colour.  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300317">17</span></span>He beside
whom his bay steeds bear the Ādityas, by whom as  
   sacrifice go many knowing.  
  The sole light shining spread through various places.  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300318">18</span></span>This seven
make the one-wheeled chariot ready: bearing seven  
   names the single courser draws it.  
  The wheel, three-naved, is sound and undecaying: thereon these  
   worlds of life are all dependent.  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300319">19</span></span>Eight times
attached the potent Courser draws it, Sire of the  
  Gods, father of hymns and praises.  
  So Mātarisvan, measuring in spirit the thread of Order, purifies  
   all regions.  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300320">20</span></span>The thread
that goes through all celestial quarters within the  
  Gāyatri, womb of life eternal.  
  This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300321">21</span></span>There are
the settings, three the upward risings, three are the-  
   spaces, yea, and three the heavens.  
  We know thy triple place of birth, O Agni, we know the deities''  
   triple generations. <span id="page_123">p. 123</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300322">22</span></span>He who, as
soon as born, laid broad earth open, and set the  
   ocean in the air's mid-region, This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300323">23</span></span>Thou, Agni,
kind with lights and mental powers, hast up in  
   heaven shone as the Sun, enkindled.  
  The Maruts, sons of Prisni, sang his praises what time the Gods  
   gave Rohita his being. This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300324">24</span></span>Giver of
breath, giver of strength and vigour, he whose com-  
   mandment all the Gods acknowledge,  
  He who is Lord of this, of man and cattle, This God, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300325">25</span></span>The
single-footed hath outstepped the biped, the biped overtakes  
   the triple-footed.  
  The quadruped hath wrought when bipeds called him, standing  
   and looking on the five collected.  
  This God is wroth offended by the sinner that wrongs the  
  Brāhman who hath gained this knowledge.  
  Agitate him, O Rohita; destroy him: entangle in thy snares the  
  Brāhman's tyrant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300326">26</span></span>Born is the
darksome Mother's Son, the whitely shining Calf of  
  Night.  
  He, Rohita, ascendeth up to heaven, hath mounted to the  
   heights.
