### HYMN IX

#### An incantation for the destruction of a hostile army

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100901">1</span></span>All arms and
every arrow, all the power and might that bows  
   possess,  
  The warlike weapon, axes, swords, the plan and purpose in the  
   heart,  
  All this, O Arbudi, make thou visible to our enemies, and let  
   them look on mist and fog.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100902">2</span></span>Arise ye and
prepare yourselves: ye, the celestial hosts, are  
   friends.  
  Let your mysterious natures be seen by our friends O Arbudi.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100903">3</span></span>Rise both of
you: begin your work with fettering and binding.  
   fast,  
  Assail, both of you, Arbudi, the armies of our enemies.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100904">4</span></span>The God
whose name is Arbudi, and Nyarbudi the Mighty  
  One,  
  The two by whom the air and this great earth are compassed  
   and possessed,  
  With these two friends of Indra I go forth to conquer with the  
   host.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100905">5</span></span>Rise with
our army stand thou up. O Godlike Being, Arbudi.  
  Breaking the hosts of enemies, surround them with thy winding  
   coils.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100906">6</span></span>Exhibiting,
O Arbudi, seven children of the mist and fog,  
  When butter hath been offered, rise with all of these and with  
   the host.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100907">7</span></span>Beating her
breast, with tearful face, let the short-earned, the  
   wild-haired hag. <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>  
  Shriek loudly when a man is slain, pierced through by thee, O  
  Arbudi;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100908">8</span></span>Snatching
away the vertebra, while with her thought she seeks  
   her son,  
  Her husband, brother, kin, when one, Arbudi! hath been pierc-  
   ed by thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100909">9</span></span>Let
vultures, ravens, kites, and crows, and every carrion-eating  
   bird.  
  Feast on our foes, and show where one, Arbudi! hath been  
   pierced by thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100910">10</span></span>Then let
each greedy beast of prey, and fly and worm regale  
   itself  
  Upon the human corpse where one, Arbudi, hath been pierced  
   by thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100911">11</span></span>Attack
them, both of you; bear off their vital breath O Nyar-  
   budi.  
  Let mingled shouts and echoing cries of woe amid our foemen  
   show where thou, O Arbudi, hast pierced  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100912">12</span></span>Shake them,
and let them sink with fear: e'erwhelm our enemies  
   with dread.  
  With widely-grasping bends of arm, O Arbudi, crush down our  
   foes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100913">13</span></span>Let those
mens' arms grow faint and weak, dull be the purpose  
   of their heart;  
  And let not aught of them be left when thou, O Arbudi, hast  
   pierced.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1100914">14</span></span>Self-smiting, beating breast and thigh,
careless of unguent, with  
   their hair dishevelled, weeping,  
  hags shall run together, when a man is slain, when thou, O  
  Arbudi, hast pierced.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100915">15</span></span>Apsarases
with dog-like mates, and Rūpakās, O Arbudi,  
  And her who licks the cup inside, and seeks to wound in ill-  
   kept place,  
  All these, O Arbudi, do thou make visible to our enemies and  
   let them look on mists and fog.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100916">16</span></span>The fiend
who creeps upon the sword, maimed, dwelling where  
  Lthe wounded lie,  
  The misty shapes that lurk concealed, Gandharvas and Apsara-  
   ses, demons, and snakes and Other Folk; <span id="page_70">p.
70</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100917">17</span></span>Armed with
four fangs and yellow teeth, deformed, with faces  
   smeared with blood, the terrible and fearless ones,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100918">18</span></span>Make thou,
O Arbudi, those wings of hostile armies quake with  
   dread.  
  Let Conqueror and Victor, friends of Indra, overcome our foes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100919">19</span></span>Stifled and
crushed, O Nyarbudi, low let the smitten foeman lie.  
  With tongue of fire and crest of smoke go conquering maidens  
   with our host!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100920">20</span></span>May Indra,
Lord of Might, strike down each bravest warrior of  
   the foes,  
  Whom this our band hath put to flight: let not one man of  
   those escape.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100921">21</span></span>Let their
hearts burst asunder, let their breath fly up and pass  
   away.  
  Let dryness of the mouth o'ertake our foemen, not the friendly  
   ones.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100922">22</span></span>The clever
and the foolish ones, those who are twisted round,  
   the deaf,  
  The dusky-hued, the hornless goats and those whose voice is like  
   the buck's,  
  All these, O Arbudi, do thou make visible to our enemies:  
   cause them to look on mists and fog.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100923">23</span></span>Arbudi and
Trishandhi fall upon our foes and scatter them,  
  So that, O Indra, Lord of Might, Slayer of Vritra, we may kill  
   thousands of these our enemies!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100924">24</span></span>Tall trees,
and those who live in woods, the herbs and creeping  
   plants of Earth,  
  Gandharvas, and Apsarases, Snakes, \[       \] Beings, Fathers,  
  Gods,  
  All these do thou, O Arbudi, make visible to our enemies:  
   cause them to look on mists and fog.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100925">25</span></span>High sway
have Maruts, and the God Āditya, Brāhmanaspati,  
  High sway have Indra, Agni, and Dilator, Mitra, Prajāpati,  
  High sway have Rishis given to you, showing upon our enemies  
   where thou, O Arbudi, hast pierced.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100926">26</span></span>With full
dominion over these, rise, stand ye up, prepare your-  
   selves,  
  Ye are our friends, celestial hosts. When ye have won this  
   battle, go, each to his several sphere, apart.
