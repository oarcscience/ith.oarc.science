### HYMN LXX

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007001">1</span></span>Thou, Indra,
with the Tempest-Gods, the breakers down of  
   what is firm,  
  Foundest the kine even in the cave.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007002">2</span></span>Worshipping
even as they list, singers laud him who findeth  
   wealth,  
  The far-renowned, the mighty One.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007003">3</span></span>Then, faring
on by Indra's side, the fearless, let thyself be seen,.  
  Both gracious and in splendour peers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007004">4</span></span>With Indra's
well-beloved hosts, the blameless, tending heaven-  
   ward,  
  The sacrificer cries aloud.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007005">5</span></span>Come from
this place, O wanderer, or downward from the light  
   of heaven!  
  Our songs of praise all yearn for this.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007006">6</span></span>Or Indra we
implore for help from here, from heaven above the  
   earth,  
  Or from the spacious firmament.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007007">7</span></span>Indra the
singers with high praise, Indra reciters with their  
   lauds,  
  Indra the choirs have glorified.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007008">8</span></span>Indra hath
ever close to him his two bay steeds and word-yoked  
   car,  
  Indra the golden, Thunder-armed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007009">9</span></span>Indra hath
raisedjthe Sun on high in heaven, that he may see  
   afar:  
  He burst the mountain for the kine.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007010">10</span></span>Help us, O
Indra, in the frays, yea, frays where thousand spoils  
   are gained,  
  With awful aids, O awful One.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007011">11</span></span>In mighty
battle we invoke, Indra, Indra in lesser fight,  
  The friend who bends his bolt at fiends.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007012">12</span></span>Unclose,
our manly Hero, thou for ever bounteous, yonder  
   cloud,  
  For us, thou irresistible.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007013">13</span></span>Still
higher, at each strain of mine, thunder-armed Indra's,  
   praises rise:  
  I find no laud worthy of him. <span id="page_321">p. 321</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007014">14</span></span>Even as the
bull drives on the herds, he drives the people with  
   his might,  
  The ruler irresistible:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007015">15</span></span>Indra who
rules with single sway men, riches, and the fivefold  
   race.  
  Of those who dwell upon the earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007016">16</span></span>For your
sake from each side we call Indra away from other  
   men:  
  Ours, and none others', may he be.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007017">17</span></span>Indra,
bring wealth that gives delight, the victor's ever-conquer-  
   ing wealth,  
  Most excellent, to be our aid;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007018">18</span></span>By means of
which we may repel our foes in battle hand to  
   hand.  
  By thee assisted with the car.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007019">19</span></span>Aided by
thee, the Thunder-armed, Indra; may we lit up the  
   bolt,  
  And conquer all our foes in fight.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007020">20</span></span>With thee,
O Indra, for ally, with missile-darting heroes may  
  We conquer our embattled foes.
