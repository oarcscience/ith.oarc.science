### HYMN XIII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501301">1</span></span>He in whose
house the Vrātya who possesses this knowledge  
   abides one night secures for himself thereby the holy realms  
   that are on earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501302">2</span></span>A second
night . . . . the holy realms that are in the firma-  
   ment (the rest as in verse 1).  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501303">3</span></span>A third
night . . . the holy realms that are in heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501304">4</span></span>A fourth
night . . . . the holy realms of the Holy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501305">5</span></span>Unlimited
nights . . . . unlimited holy realms.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501306">6</span></span>Now he to
whose house a non-Vrātya, calling himself a Vrātya,  
   and one in name only, comes as a guest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501307">7</span></span>Should
punish him and not punish him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501308">8</span></span>He should
serve him with food saying to himself, To this Deity  
  I offer water: I lodge this Deity; I wait upon this, this  
  Deity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501309">9</span></span>To that
Deity the sacrifice of him who has this knowledge is  
   acceptable.
