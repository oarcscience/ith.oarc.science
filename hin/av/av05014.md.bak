### HYMN XIV

#### A charm against witchcraft

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501401">1</span></span>An eagle
found thee: with his snout a wild boar dug thee from  
   the earth.  
  Harm thou, O Plant, the mischievous, and drive the sorcerer  
   away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501402">2</span></span>Beat thou
the Yātudhānas back, drive thou away the sorcerer;  
  And chase afar, O Plant, the man who fain would do us injury.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501403">3</span></span>As 'twere a
strip cut round from skin of a white-footed an-  
   telope,  
  Bind, like a golden chain, O God, his witchcraft on the sorcerer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501404">4</span></span>Take thou
his sorcery by the hand, and to the sorcerer lead it  
   back.  
  Lay it before him, face to face, that it may kill the sorcerer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501405">5</span></span>Back on the
wizard fall his craft, upon the curser light his  
   curse! <span id="page_a172">p. a172</span>  
  Let witchcraft, like a well-naved car, roll back upon the  
   sorcerer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501406">6</span></span>Whoso, for
other's harm hath dealt-woman or man-in magic  
   arts,  
  To him we lead the sorcery back, even as a courser with a rope.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501407">7</span></span>Now whether
thou hast been prepared by Gods or been pre-  
   pared by men,  
  We, with our Indra at our side to aid us, lead thee back again.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501408">8</span></span>Agni,
victorious in fight, subdue the armies of our foes!  
  Back on the sorcerer we cast his sorcery, and beat it home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501409">9</span></span>Thou who
hast piercing weapons, pierce him who hath wrought  
   it; conquer him.  
  We do not sharpen thee to slay the man who hath not practised  
   it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501410">10</span></span>Go as a son
goes to his sire: bite as a trampled viper bites.  
  As one who flies from bonds, go back, O Witchcraft, to the  
   sorcerer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501411">11</span></span>Even as the
timid antelope or hind from her assailant flees,  
  So swiftly let the sorcery o'ertake and reach the sorcerer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501412">12</span></span>Straighter
than any arrow let it fly against him, Heaven and  
  Earth.  
  So let that witchcraft seize again the wizard like a beast of  
   chase.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501413">13</span></span>Let it go
contrary like flame, like water following its course.  
  Let witchcraft, like a well-naved car, roll back upon the  
   sorcerer.
