### HYMN XXVII

#### A charm to obtain invisibility

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0102701">1</span></span>There on the
bank those Vipers lie, thrice-seven, having cast  
   their skins:  
  Now we with their discarded sloughs bind close and cover up the  
   eyes of the malicious highway thief.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0102702">2</span></span>Far let her
go, cutting her way, brandishing, as it were, a club:  
  Diverted be the new-born's mind: ne'er are the wicked  
   prosperous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0102703">3</span></span>Not many
have had power enough; the feeble ones have not  
   prevailed,  
  Like scattered fragments of a reed: ne'er are the wicked pros-  
   perous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0102704">4</span></span>Go forward,
feet, press quickly on, bring to the house of him  
   who pays.  
  Unconquered and unplundered, let Indrānf, foremost, lead the  
   way.
