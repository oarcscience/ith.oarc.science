### HYMN I

#### The hyperbolical glorification of the Vrātya or Aryan Non-conformist

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500101">1</span></span>There was a
roaming Vrātya. He roused Prajāpati to action.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500102">2</span></span>Prajāpati
beheld gold in himself and engendered it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500103">3</span></span>That became
unique, that became distinguished, that became  
   great, that became excellent, that became Devotion, that be-  
   came holy Fervour, that became Truth: through that he was  
   born.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500104">4</span></span>He grew, he
became great, he became Mahādeva.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500105">5</span></span>He gained
the lordship of the Gods. He became Lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500106">6</span></span>He became
Chief Vrātya. He held a bow, even that Bow of  
  Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500107">7</span></span>His belly is
dark-blue, his back is red.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500108">8</span></span>With
dark-blue he envelops a detested rival, with red he pierces  
   the man who hates him: so the theologians say.
