### HYMN XVI

#### On the omnipresence and omniscience of Varuna

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401601">1</span></span>The mighty
Ruler of these worlds beholds as though from close  
   at hand,  
  The man who thinks he acts by stealth: all this the Gods  
   perceive and know.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401602">2</span></span>If a man
stands or walks or moves in secret, goes to his lying-  
   down or his uprising,  
  What two men whisper as they sit together, King Varuna knows:  
   he as the third is present.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401603">3</span></span>This earth,
too, is King Varuna's possession, and the high  
   heaven whose ends are far asunder.  
  The loins of Varuna are both the oceans, and this small drop of  
   water, too, contains him. <span id="page_a124">p. a124</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401604">4</span></span>If one
should flee afar beyond the heaven, King Varuna would  
   still be round about him.  
  Proceeding hither from the sky his envoys look, thousand-eyed,  
   over the earth beneath them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401605">5</span></span>All this the
royal Varuna beholdeth, all between heaven and  
   earth and all beyond them.  
  The twinklings of men's eyelids hath he counted. As one who  
   plays throws dice he settles all things.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401606">6</span></span>Those fatal
snares of thine which stand extended, threefold,  
  O Varuna, seven by seven,  
  May they all catch the man who tells a falsehood, and pass un-  
   harmed the man whose words are truthful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401607">7</span></span>Varuna,
snare him with a hundred nooses! Man's watcher! let  
   not him who lies escape thee.  
  There let the villain sit with hanging belly and bandaged like a  
   cask whose hoops are broken.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401608">8</span></span>Varuna
sends, and drives away, diseases: Varuna is both native  
   and a stranger,  
  Varuna is celestial and is human.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401609">9</span></span>I bind and
hold thee fast with all these nooses, thou son of such  
   a man and such a mother.  
  All these do I assign thee as thy portion.
