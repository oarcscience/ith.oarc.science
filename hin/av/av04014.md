### HYMN XIV

#### Accompanying the sacrifice of a he-goat

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401401">1</span></span>The Goat was
verily produced from Agni. Through sorrow he  
   beheld, at first, his father.  
  Through him at first the Gods attained to godhead, and, meet  
   for sacrifices, were exalted.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401402">2</span></span>Bearing in
hands seethed viands, go with Agni to the cope of  
   heaven.  
  Reaching the sky that touches heaven, mix with the company of  
  Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401403">3</span></span>From earth's
high ridge to middle air I mounted, and from mid-  
   air ascended up to heaven.  
  From the high pitch of heaven's cope I came into the world of  
   light.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401404">4</span></span>Mounting the
sky they look not round; they rise to heaven  
   through both the worlds,  
  Sages who paid the sacrifice that pours its streams on every  
   side.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401405">5</span></span>First among
all the deities, come forward, thou who art eye of  
  Gods and men, O Agni.  
  Imploring, and accordant with the Bhrigus, to heaven in safety  
   go the sacrificers!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401406">6</span></span>With milk
and butter I anoint the mighty, celestial Goat, strong-  
   winged, and full of juices.  
  Through him will we attain the world of virtue, ascending to the  
   loftiest cope, to heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401407">7</span></span>Set the
Goat's head toward the eastern region, and turn his right  
   side to the southern quarter.  
  His hinder part turn to the western quarter, and set his left side  
   to the northern region.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401408">8</span></span>Set the
Goat's backbone upmost in the zenith, and lay his belly  
   downward in the nadir; set his midportion in mid-air between  
   them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401409">9</span></span>O'er the
dressed Goat lay a dressed skin to robe him prepared,  
   in perfect form, with all his members.  
  Rise upward to the loftiest vault of heaven: with thy four feet  
   stand firmly in the regions.
