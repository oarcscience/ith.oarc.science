### HYMN III

#### On the consecration of a newly built house

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900301">1</span></span>We loose the
ties and fastenings of the house that holds all  
   precious things,  
  The bands of pillars and of stays, the ties of beams that form  
   the roof.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900302">2</span></span>All-wealthy
House! each knot and band, each cord that is  
   attached to thee  
  I with my spell untie, as erst Brihaspati disclosed the cave.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900303">3</span></span>He drew them
close, he pressed them fast, he made thy knotted.  
   bands secure:  
  With Indra's help we loose them as a skilful Slaughterer severs  
   joints.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900304">4</span></span>We loose the
bands of thy bamboos, of bolts, of fastening, of  
   thatch,  
  We loose the ties of thy side-posts, O House that holdest all we  
   prize.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900305">5</span></span>We loosen
here the ties and bands of straw in bundles, and of  
   clamps,  
  Of all that compasses and binds the Lady Genius of the Home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900306">6</span></span>We loose the
loops which men have bound within thee, loops  
   to tie and hold.  
  Be gracious, when erected, to our bodies, Lady of the Home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900307">7</span></span>Store-house
of Soma, Agni's hall, the ladies' bower, the resi-  
   dence,  
  The seat of Gods art thou, O Goddess House. <span id="page_a363">p.
a363</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900308">8</span></span>We with our
incantation loose the net that hath a thousand.  
   eyes.  
  The diadem, securely tied and laid upon the central beam.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900309">9</span></span>The man who
takes thee as his own, and he who was thy builder,.  
  House!  
  Both these, O Lady of the Home, shall live to long-extended'  
   years.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900310">10</span></span>There let
her come to meet this man. Firm, strongly fastened,.  
   and prepared  
  Art thou whose several limbs and joints we part and loosen one  
   by one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900311">11</span></span>He who
collected timber for the work and built thee up, O  
  House,  
  Made thee for coming progeny, Prajāpati, the Lord Supreme.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900312">12</span></span>Homage to
him! We worship too the giver and the Mansion's  
   lord:  
  Homage to Agni! to the man who serves at holy rites for thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900313">13</span></span>Homage to
kine and steeds! to all that shall be born within the  
   house  
  We loose the bonds that fasten thee, mother of multitudes to  
   come!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900314">14</span></span>Agni thou
shelterest within, and people with domestic beasts.  
  We loose the bonds that fasten thee, mother of multitudes to  
   come!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900315">15</span></span>All space
that lies between the earth and heaven, therewith I  
   take this house for thy possession,  
  And all that measures out the air's mid-region I make a hollow  
   to contain thy treasures. Therewith I take the house for his  
   possession.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900316">16</span></span>Rich in
prosperity, rich in milk, founded and built upon the  
   earth,  
  Injure not thy receivers, House who holdest food of every sort!'  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0900317">17</span></span>Grass-covered, clad with straw, the
house, like Night, gives rest  
   to man and beast.  
  Thou standest, built upon the earth, like a she-elephant, borne  
   on feet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900318">18</span></span>I loosen
and remove from thee thy covering formed by mats of  
   reed.  
  What Varuna hath firmly closed Mitra shall ope at early morn. <span
id="page_a364">p. a364</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900319">19</span></span>May Indra,
Agni, deathless Gods, protect the house where  
  Soma dwells,  
  House that was founded with the prayer, built and erected by  
   the wise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900320">20</span></span>Nest upon
nest hath been imposed, compartment on compart-  
   ment laid:  
  There man shall propagate his kind, and there shall everything  
   born.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900321">21</span></span>Within the
house constructed with two side-posts, or with four,  
   or six.  
  Built with eight side-posts, or with ten, lies Agni like a babe  
   unborn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900322">22</span></span>Turned to
thee, House! I come to thee, innocent, turned to  
   welcome me:  
  For Fire and Water are within, the first chief door of sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900323">23</span></span>Water that
kills Consumption, free from all Consumption, here  
  I bring.  
  With Agni, the immortal one, I enter and possess the house.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900324">24</span></span>Lay thou no
cord or noose on us: a weighty burthen, still be  
   light!  
  Withersoever be our will, O House, we bear thee like a bride.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900325">25</span></span>Now from
the east side of the house to the Great Power be  
   homage paid!  
  Hail to the Gods whose due is Hail!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900326">26</span></span>Now from
the south side of the house, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900327">27</span></span>Now from
the west side of the house, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900328">28</span></span>Now from
the north side of the house, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900329">29</span></span>So from the
mansion's every side to the Great Power be homage  
   paid!  
  Hail to the Gods whose due is Hail!
