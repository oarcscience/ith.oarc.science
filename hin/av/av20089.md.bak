### HYMN LXXXIX

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008901">1</span></span>Even as an
archer shoots afar his arrow, offer the laud to him  
   with meet adornment.  
  Quell with your voice the wicked's voice, O sages, Singer, make  
  Indra rest beside the Soma.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008902">2</span></span>Draw thy
Friend to thee like a cow at milking: O singer, wake  
   up Indra as a lover.  
  Make thou the Hero haste to give us riches even as a vessel  
   filled brimful with treasure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008903">3</span></span>Why,
Maghavan, do they call thee bounteous Giver? Quicken  
   me: thou, I hear, art he who quickens.  
  Sakra, let my intelligence be active, and bring us luck that finds  
   great wealth, O Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008904">4</span></span>Standing, in
battle for their rights, together, the people, Indra,  
   in the fray invoke thee.  
  Him who brings gifts the Hero makes his comrade: with him  
   who pours no juice he seeks not friendship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008905">5</span></span>Whoso with
plenteous juice for him expresses strong Somas as  
   much quickly-coming treasure,  
  For him he everthrows in early morning his swift well-weapon-  
   ed foes and slays the tyrant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008906">6</span></span>He unto whom
we offer praises, Indra, Maghavan, who hath  
   joined to ours his wishes  
  Before him even afar the foe must tremble: low before him must  
   bow all human glories.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008907">7</span></span>With thy
fierce bolt, O God invoked of many, drive to a distance  
   from afar the foeman.  
  O Indra, give us wealth in corn and cattle, and make the singer's  
   prayer gain strength and riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008908">8</span></span>Indra the
swallower of strong libations with their thick residue,  
   the potent Somas,  
  He, Maghavan, will not restrict his bounty: he brings much  
   wealth unto the Soma-presser.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008909">9</span></span>Yea, by
superior play he wins advantage when he, a gambler,  
   piles his gains in season. <span id="page_335">p. 335</span>  
  Celestial-natured, he o'erwhelms with riches the devotee who  
   keeps not back his money.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008910">10</span></span>O
much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with  
   store of grain and cattle.  
  May we allied, as first in rank, with princes,:obtain possessions  
   by our own exertion  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008911">11</span></span>Brihaspati
protect us from the rearward, and from above and  
   from below, from sinners.  
  May Indra from the front and from the centre, as friend to  
   friends, vouchsafe us room and freedom.
