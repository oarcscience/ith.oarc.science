  Fathers, enjoy the rain from one who strives to win the Marutes  
   heart.<span id="page_a123">p. a123</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401516">16</span></span>Lift up the
mighty cask and pour down water; let the wind  
   blow, and lightnings flash around us.  
  Let sacrifice be paid, and, widely scattered, let herbs and plants  
   be full of joy and gladness.
