### HYMN XXXIV

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003401">1</span></span>He who just
born, chief God of lofty spirit, by power and might  
   became the God's protector,  
  Before whose breath, through greatness of his valour, the two  
   worlds trembled, He, O men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003402">2</span></span>He who fixed
fast and firm the earth that staggered, and set at  
   rest the agitated mountains,  
  Who measured out air's wider middle region and gave the  
   heaven support, He, O men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003403">3</span></span>Who slew the
Dragon, freed the Seven Rivers, and draye the  
   kine forth from the cave of Vala,  
  Begat the fire between both stones, the spoiler in warrior's  
   battle, He, O men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003404">4</span></span>By whom this
universe was made to tremble, who chased away  
   the humbled brood of demon,  
  Who, like a gambler gathering his winnings, seized the foe's  
   riches, He, O men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003405">5</span></span>Of whom, the
terrible, they ask, Where is He? or verily they  
   say of him, He is not.  
  He wastes the foeman's wealth like stakes of gamblers. Have  
   faith in him for He, O men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003406">6</span></span>Stirrer to
action of the poor and lowly, of priest, of suppliant  
   who sings his praises  
  Who, fair-faced, favours him who presseth Soma with stones  
   adjusted, He, O men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003407">7</span></span>He under
whose supreme control are horses, all chariots, and  
   the hamlets, and the cattle:  
  He who begat the Sun, begat the Morning, leader of waters.  
  He, O men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003408">8</span></span>To whom both
armies cry in close encounter, foe against foe, the  
   stronger and the weaker; <span id="page_291">p. 291</span>  
  Whom two invoke upon one chariot mounted, each for himself,  
  He, O ye men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003409">9</span></span>He, without
whom men conquer not in battle, whom, warring,  
   they invoke for help and succour;  
  He, all this universe's type and image, who shakes what never  
   shook, He, men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003410">10</span></span>He who hath
smitten, ere they know their danger, with his hurl-  
   ed weapon many grievous sinners:  
  Who pardons not his boldness who provokes him, who slays the  
  Dasyu, He, O men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003411">11</span></span>He who
discovered in the fortieth autumn Sambara dwelling in  
   the midst of mountains:  
  Who slew the Dragon putting forth his vigour, the demon lying  
   there, He, men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003412">12</span></span>Who drank
the juice poured at the seas of Order, subduing  
  Sambara by superior prowess,  
  Who hoarded food within the mountain's hollow wherein he  
   grew in strength, He, men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003413">13</span></span>Who, with
seven guiding reins, the Bull, the mighty, set the  
  Seven Rivers free to flow at pleasure;  
  Who, thunder-armed, rent Rauhina in pieces when scaling  
   heaven, He, O ye men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003414">14</span></span>Heaven,
even, and the earth bow down before him, before his  
   very breath the mountains tremble.  
  Known as the Soma-drinker, armed with thunder, the wielder  
   of the bolt, He, men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003415">15</span></span>Who aids
with favour him who pours the Soma, and him who  
   brews it, sacrificer, singer;  
  Whose strength our prayer and offered Soma heighten, and this  
   our gift, He, O ye men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003416">16</span></span>Born,
manifested in his Parents' bosom, He knoweth as a son  
   the Highest Father.  
  He who with vigorous energy assisted the companies of Gods,  
  He, men, is Indra  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003417">17</span></span>Lord of Bay
steeds, who loves the flowing Soma, He before  
   whom all living creatures tremble.  
  He who smote Sambara and slaughtered Sushna, He the Sole  
  Hero, He, O men, is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003418">18</span></span>Thou verily
art true strong God who sendest wealth to the man  
   who brews and pours libation. <span id="page_292">p. 292</span>  
  So may we evermore, thy friends, O Indra, address the synod  
   with brave sons about us.
