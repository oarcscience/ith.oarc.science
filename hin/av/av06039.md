### HYMN XXXIX

#### A priest's prayer for power and glory

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0603901">1</span></span>Let
sacrifice, like fame, thrive sped by Indra, inspired, well-  
   ordered, with a thousand powers.  
  To highest rank raise me who bring oblation, me who move  
   forth to far-extended vision.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0603902">2</span></span>We will pay
sacrifice and serve with worship our glorious Indra,  
   famous for his glories.  
  Give thou us sway which Indra hath promoted, and in this boon  
   of thine may we be famous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0603903">3</span></span>Indra was
glorious at his birth; Agni, Soma were born  
   renowned.  
  And glorious am I, the most illustrious of all that is.
