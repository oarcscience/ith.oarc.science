### HYMN II

#### A funeral hymn, and deprecation of Agni the Consumer of corpses

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200201">1</span></span>This is no
place to hold thee; mount the Nāda: this lead is  
   thine appointed share. Come hither.  
  Together with Consumption in the cattle, Consumption in our  
   men, go henee, go southward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200202">2</span></span>With this we
chase and banish all consumptive malady and  
  Death,  
  With sinner andamalicious man, with helper and with minister,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200203">3</span></span>Death and
Misfortune we expel, Malignity we drive away.  
  O Agni, thou who eatest not the corpse, eat him who hateth us:  
   him whom we hate we send to thee. <span id="page_83">p. 83</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200204">4</span></span>If the
corpse-eating Agni, or a tiger leaving his lair, hath entered  
   this our homestead,  
  With beans prepared in butter I expel him: far let him go to  
   fires that lie in waters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200205">5</span></span>When,
angered that a man hath died, we in our wrath have  
   banished thee,  
  That deed is easily set right through thee: we kindle thee again.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200206">6</span></span>Again have
the Ādityas, Rudras, Vasus, the Brāhman, bringer  
   of good things, O Agni,  
  Again hath Brāhmanaspati disposed thee for long life lasting  
   through a hundred autumns.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200207">7</span></span>I sweep
afar, for sacrifice to Fathers, corpse-eating Agni who  
   hath come among us,  
  Although he saw this other, Jātavedas: in loftiest space let him  
   inflame the caldron.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200208">8</span></span>I drive
corpse-eating Agni to a distance: sin-laden let him go to  
  Yamas vassals.  
  Here let this other, Jātavedas, carry oblation to the Deities, fore-  
   knowing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200209">9</span></span>I quickly
sweep away corpse-eating Agni, Death, with his bolt  
   potdepriving men of motion.  
  From household fire, well-knowing, I divide him: so in the  
   world of Fathers be his portion.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1200210">10</span></span>Corpse-eating Agni, toil-worn, meet for
praises, I send away  
   bypaths used by the Fathers.  
  Stay there; keep watch among the Fathers: come not again to  
   us by ways whereon Gods travel.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200211">11</span></span>They being
cleansed and bright, the purifiers, kindle Sankasuka  
   for our well-being.  
  Impurity leaveth us and sin departeth: lighted by the good  
   cleanser Agni cleanseth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200212">12</span></span>Agni the
God, the Breaker-up, hath mounted to the heights of  
   heaven.  
  Released from all transgression, he hath from the curse delivered  
   us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200213">13</span></span>On Agni
here, the Breaker-up, we wipe impurities away.  
  Cleansed, fit for sacrifice have we become: may he prolong our  
   lives.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200214">14</span></span>The
Breaker-up, the Burster, the Destroyer, and the Silent One, <span
id="page_84">p. 84</span>  
  These have expelled Consumption far, far off from thee ānd all  
   thou hast,  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1200215">15</span></span>Corpse-eating Agni we expel, the Agni
who bewilders men,  
  Him who is in our horses, in our heroes, cows, and goats, and  
   sheep:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200216">16</span></span>We drive
thee forth to other folk, to alien cattle, alien steeds,  
  Thee the corpse-eating Agni, thee the Agni who bewilders men,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200217">17</span></span>Whereon the
Deities, whereon men too have purified themselves,  
  Exalting fatness, cleanse thyself, Agni, therein and mount to  
   heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200218">18</span></span>O Agni,
kindled and adored, turn not away to visit us.  
  Shine brightly even there in heaven, so that we long may see the  
  Sun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200219">19</span></span>Wipe all
away on lead and reed, on Agni, him who breaketh up,  
  Then on a black-hued sheep, and on a cushion pain that racks.  
   the head,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200220">20</span></span>Wipe off
pollution, lay it in the lead and in the black-hued  
   sheep,  
  And headache in the cushion; then be cleansed and fit to sacri-  
   fice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200221">21</span></span>Go onward,
Death, pursue thy special pathway apart from that  
   which Gods are wont to travel.  
  To thee I say it who hast eyes and hearest: great grow the  
   number of these men around us!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200222">22</span></span>Divided
from the dead are these, the living: now is our calling  
   on the Gods successful.  
  We have gone forth for dancing and for laughter: may we with  
   brave sons speak to the assembly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200223">23</span></span>Here I
erect this rampart for the living: let none of these, none  
   other, reach this limit.  
  May they survive a hundred lengthened autumns, and may they  
   bury Death beneath this mountain.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200224">24</span></span>Live your
full lives and find age delightful, all of you striving,  
   one behind the other.  
  May Tvashtar, maker of fair things, be gracious, and lead your  
   whole lives on to full existence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200225">25</span></span>As the days
follow days in close succession, as with the seasons  
   duly come the seasons.  
  As each successor fails not his foregoer, so constitute the lives of  
   these, Ordainer! <span id="page_85">p. 85</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200226">26</span></span>Gather your
strength, my friends; the stream flows stony:  
   acquit yourselves as men, and cross the river.  
  Abandon here the powers that were malignant, and let us cross  
   to powers exempt from sickness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200227">27</span></span>Rise up
erect, cross over, my companions: the stream is stony  
   that flows here before us.  
  Abandon here the powers that were ungracious, and let us cross  
   to powers benign and friendly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200228">28</span></span>Becoming
pure and bright and purifying begin the Vaisvadevi  
   strain for splendour..  
  May we rejoice, o'erpassing troublous places, with all our heroes  
   through a hundred winters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200229">29</span></span>On pathways
swept by wind, directed upward, passing beyond  
   the lower, on the higher,  
  Thrice seven times have the Rishis, the Departed, forced Mrityu  
   backward with the fastened fetter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200230">30</span></span>Effecting
Mrityu's footstep ye came hither, to further times pro-  
   longing your existence,  
  Seated, drive Mrityu to his proper dwelling: then may we,  
   living, speak to the assembly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200231">31</span></span>Let these
unwidowed dames with goodly husbands adorn them-  
   selves with fragrant balm and unguent,  
  Decked with fair jewels, tearless, sound and healthy, first let the  
   dames go up to where he lieth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200232">32</span></span>I with
oblation separate both classes, and with my prayer dis-  
   part their several portions.  
  I offer food that wastes not to the Fathers, a nd to these men  
   give life of long duration.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200233">33</span></span>That Agni,
Fathers! who, himself immortal, hath entered and  
   possessed our mortal bosoms,  
  Even him I grasp and hold the God with me, Let him not hate  
   us, may we never hate him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200234">34</span></span>When ye
have left the household fire, with the Corpse-eater  
   southward go.  
  Do that which is delightful to the Fathers, Brāhmans, and your-  
   selves.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200235">35</span></span>Agni, the
banqueter on flesh, not banished, for the eldest son  
  Taketh a double share of wealth and spoileth it with poverty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200236">36</span></span>What man
acquires by plough, by war, all that he wins by toil  
   of hand, <span id="page_86">p. 86</span>  
  He loses all if Agni the Carnivorous be not set aside,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200237">37</span></span>Unholy,
splendour-reft is he, his sacrifice unfit to eat. Krayād  
   deprives of tilth of cow, of riches him whom he pursues,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200238">38</span></span>Oft as a
greedy beggar speaks the mortal who has brought  
   distress,  
  Those whom Carnivorous Agni close at hand runs after and  
   detects.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200239">39</span></span>When a
dame's husband dies the house is tangled [fast](errata.htm#0.md) in  
  Grāhi's net.  
  A learned Brāhman must be sought to drive Carnivorous Agni,  
   forth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200240">40</span></span>From any
evil we have done, act of impurity or sin,  
  Let waters purge me and from all that comes from Agni  
  Breaker-up.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200241">41</span></span>By pathways
travelled by the Gods these waters, well-knowing,  
   from below have mounted upward.  
  High on the summit of the raining mountain the ancient rivers  
   fresh and new are flowing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200242">42</span></span>Drive off
Carnivorous Agni, thou Agni who eatest not the flesh;.  
   carry oblation paid to Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200243">43</span></span>The
Flesh-eater hath entered him: he hath pursued the Flesh-  
   eater.  
  Making two tigers different-wise, I bear away the ungracious  
   one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200244">44</span></span>He who
holds Gods within himself, the rampart and defence of  
   men,  
  Agni, the sacred household fire, hath come and stands between  
   them both.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200245">45</span></span>Prolong the
lives of those who live, O Agni, Let the dead go  
   unto world of Fathers.  
  As goodly household fire burn up Arāti; give this man dawn  
   brighter than all the mornings.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200246">46</span></span>Subduing
all our adversaries, Agni, give us their food, their  
   strength and their possessions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200247">47</span></span>Grasp ye
this Indra, furtherer, satisfier: he will release you  
   from disgrace and trouble.  
  With him drive back the shaft that flies against you, with him.  
   ward off the missile shot by Rudra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200248">48</span></span>Seize with
firm hold the Ox who boundeth forward: he will  
   uplift you from disgrace and trouble. <span id="page_87">p.
87</span>  
  Enter this ship of Savitar; let us flee from poverty over all the  
   six expenses.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200249">49</span></span>Thou
followest the day and night, supporting, standing, at  
   peace, promoting, rich in heroes.  
  Long bearing undiseased and happy sleepers, be ours, O Bed,  
   with smell of man about thee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200250">50</span></span>They sever
from the Gods, they live in sin and misery evermore,  
  Those whom from very near at hand Carnivorous Agni casteth  
   down as a horse tramples down the reeds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200251">51</span></span>The
faithless, who from lust of wealth abide with him who feeds  
   on flesh,  
  For ever set upon the fire an alien caldron, not their own.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200252">52</span></span>Forward in
spirit would he fly, and often turns he back again,  
  Whomso Carnivorous Agni from anear discovers and torments.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200253">53</span></span>Among tame
beasts the black ewe is thy portion, and the bright  
   lead is thine, they say, Flesh-eater!  
  Mashed beans have been assigned thee for oblation go seek the  
   dark wood and the wildernesses.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200254">54</span></span>I sought
the rustling sugar-cane, white Seasamum, and cane and  
   reed.  
  I made this Indra's fuel, and the Fire of Yama I removed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200255">55</span></span>Against the
sinking western Sun I set them; each sundered path,  
   knowing my way, I entered.  
  I have warned off the ghosts of the Departed: to these I give  
   the boon of long existence.
