### HYMN VI

#### A charm to exercise evil spirits who beset women

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800601">1</span></span>Let neither
fiend of evil name, Alinsa, Vatsapa, desire  
  Thy pair of husband-wooers which thy mother cleansed when,  
   thou wast born.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800602">2</span></span>Palala,
Anupalala, Sarku, Koka, Malimlucha, Palijaka Vavri-  
   vāsas and Asresha, Rikshagriva and Pramilin.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800603">3</span></span>Approach
not, come not hitherward: creep not thou in-between  
   her thighs.  
  I set, to guard her, Baja, that which chases him of evil name. <span
id="page_a337">p. a337</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800604">4</span></span>Durnāmā and
Sunāmā both are eager to converse with her.  
  We drive away Arāyas: let Sunāmā seek the women-folk,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800605">5</span></span>The black
and hairy Asura, and Stambaja and Tundika,  
  Arāyas from this girl we drive, from bosom, waist, and parts  
   below.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800606">6</span></span>Sniffer, and
Feeler, him who eats raw flesh, and him who licks  
   his lips,  
  Arāyas with the tails of dogs, the yellow Baja hath destroyed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800607">7</span></span>Whoever, in
thy brother's shape or father's comes to thee in  
   sleep,  
  Let Baja rout and chase them like eunuchs with woman's head-  
   dress on.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800608">8</span></span>Whoever
steals to thee asleep or thinks to harm thee when  
   awake,—  
  These hath it banished, as the Sun travelling round drives shade  
   away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800609">9</span></span>Whoever
causeth her to lose her child or bear untimely fruit,—  
  Destroy him, O thou Plant, destroy the slippery fiend who lusts  
   for her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800610">10</span></span>Those who
at evening, with the bray of asses, dance around the  
   house, Kukshilas, and Kusfilas, and Kakubhas, Srimas,  
  Karumas,  
  These with thine odour, O thou Plant, drive far away to every  
   side.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800611">11</span></span>Kukundhas
and Kukūrabhas who dress themselves in hides and  
   skins,  
  Who dance about like eunuchs, who raise a wild clamour in the  
   wood, all these we banish far away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800612">12</span></span>All those
who cannot bear the Sun who warms us yonder from  
   the sky,  
  Arāyas with the smell of goats, malodorous, with bloody mouths,  
   the Makakas we drive afar.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800613">13</span></span>All those
who on their shoulders bear a head of monstrous  
   magnitude,  
  Who pierce the women's loins with pain,—those demons, Indra  
   drive away!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800614">14</span></span>Those,
bearing horns upon their hands, who first of all approach  
   the brides;  
  Standing in ovens, laughing loud, those who in bushes flash forth  
   light, all these we banish hence away. <span id="page_a338">p.
a338</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800615">15</span></span>Those who
have retroverted toes, and heels and faces in the  
   front,  
  Khalajas, Sakadhūmajas, Urundas, all the Matmatas, impotent  
  Kumbhamushkas, these,  
  Drive thou, O Brāhmanaspati, far from this girl with vigilance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800616">16</span></span>Sightless
and with distorted eyes, impotent. woman less be they.  
  O Healing Plant, cast each away who, not her husband, would  
   approach this woman wedded to her lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800617">17</span></span>The
Bristly-haired, the Maniac-haired, the Biter, and the  
  Groper-fiend,  
  The Creeper-near, the Copper-hued, the Snouty, and the Saluda,  
  With foot and heel kick over, as a hasty cow her milking-pan.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800618">18</span></span>If one
should touch thy coming babe or kill thine infant newly  
   born,  
  The yellow Plant with mighty bow shall pierce him even to the  
   heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800619">19</span></span>Those who
kill infants unawares, and near the new-made mothers  
   lie,  
  Let Pinga chase the amorous Gandharvas as wind chases cloud.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800620">20</span></span>Let it
maintain the genial seed: let the laid embryo rest secure.  
  Let both strong Healers, to be worn within the girdle, guard the  
   babe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800621">21</span></span>From the
Kimīdin, for thy lord and children, Pinga shield thee  
   well,  
  From Sāyaka, and Nagnaka, Tangalva, and Pavīnasa.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800622">22</span></span>From the
five-footed, fingerless, from the four-eyed, the double-  
   faced,  
  From the Close-creeper, from the Worm, from the Quick-roller  
   guard her well.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800623">23</span></span>Those who
eat flesh uncooked, and those who eat the bleeding  
   flesh of men,  
  Feeders on babes unborn, long-haired, far from this place we  
   banish these.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800624">24</span></span>Shy
slinkers from the Sun, as slinks a woman from her husband's  
   sire,  
  Deep down into the heart of these let Baja and let Pinga pierce.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800625">25</span></span>Pinga,
preserve the babe at birth, make not the boy a female  
   child.  
  Let not Egg-eaters mar the germs: drive the Kimidins far away. <span
id="page_a339">p. a339</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800626">26</span></span>Sterility,
and infants' death, and weeping that announceth  
   woe,  
  Dear! lay them on the fiend as thou wouldst pluck a garland  
   from a tree.
