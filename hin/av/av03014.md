### HYMN XIV

#### A benediction on a cattle pen

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301401">1</span></span>A Pen
wherein to dwell at ease, abundance and prosperity,  
  Whate'er is called the birth of day, all this do we bestow on  
   you.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301402">2</span></span>May Aryaman
pour gifts on you, and Pūshan, land Brihaspati,  
  And Indra, winner of the prize. Make ye my riches grow with me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301403">3</span></span>Moving
together, free from fear, with plenteous droppings in  
   this pen,  
  Bearing sweet milk-like Soma-juice, come hither free from all  
   disease.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301404">4</span></span>Come hither,
to this place, O Cows: here thrive as though ye  
   were manured.  
  Even here increase and multiply; let us be friendly, you and me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301405">5</span></span>Auspicious
be this stall to you. Prosper like cultivated rice.  
  Even here increase and multiply. Myself do we bestow on you.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301406">6</span></span>Follow me,
Cows, as master of the cattle. Here may this Cow-  
   pen make you grow and prosper,  
  Still while we live may we approach you living, ever increasing  
   with the growth of riches.
