### HYMN XVIII

#### The wickedness of oppressing and robbing Brāhmans

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501801">1</span></span>The Gods, O
Prince, have not bestowed this cow on thee to eat  
   thereof.  
  Seek not, Rājanya, to devour the Brāhman's cow which none  
   may eat.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501802">2</span></span>A base
Rājanya, spoiled at dice, and ruined by himself, may eat.  
  The Brāhman's cow and think, To-day and not tomorrow, let  
   me live!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501803">3</span></span>The
Brāhman's cow is like a snake, charged with due poison,  
   clothed with skin.  
  Rājanya! bitter to the taste is she, and none may eat of her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501804">4</span></span>She takes
away his strength, she mars his splendour, she ruins  
   everything like fire enkindled.  
  That man drinks poison of the deadly serpent who counts the  
  Brāhman as mere food to feed him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501805">5</span></span>Whoever
smites him, deeming him a weakling-blasphemer,  
   coveting his wealth through folly  
  Indra sets fire alight within his bosom. He who acts thus is  
   loathed by Earth and Heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501806">6</span></span>No Brāhman
must be injured, safe as fire from him who loves  
   himself.  
  For Soma is akin to him and Indra guards him from the curse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501807">7</span></span>The fool who
eats the Brāhmans' food and thinks it pleasant to  
   the taste,  
  Eats, but can ne'er digest, the cow that bristles with a hundred  
   barbs,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501808">8</span></span>His voice an
arrow's neck, his tongue a bowstring, his windpipes  
   fire-enveloped heads of arrows, <span id="page_a177">p. a177</span>  
  With these the Brāhman pierces through blasphemers, with  
  God-sped bows that quell the hearts within them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501809">9</span></span>Keen arrows
have the Brāhmans, armed with missiles: the shaft,  
   when they discharge it, never faileth.  
  Pursuing him with fiery zeal and anger, they pierce the foeman  
   even from a distance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501810">10</span></span>They who,
themselves ten hundred, were the rulers of a thousand  
   men,  
  The Vaitahavyas, were destroyed for that they ate a Brāhman's  
   cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501811">11</span></span>The cow,
indeed, when she was slain o'erthrew those Vaitahavyas,  
   who  
  Cooked the last she-goat that remained of Kesaraprābandhā's  
   flock.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501812">12</span></span>One and a
hundred were the folk, those whom the earth shook  
   off from her:  
  When they had wronged the Brāhman race they perished incon-  
   ceivably.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501813">13</span></span>Among
mankind the Gods' despiser moveth: he hath drunk  
   poison, naught but bone is left him.  
  Who wrongs the kinsman of the Gods, the Brāhman, gains not  
   the sphere to which the Fathers travelled.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501814">14</span></span>Agni, in
sooth, is called our guide, Soma is called our next of  
   kin.  
  Indra quells him who curses us. Sages know well that this is so.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501815">15</span></span>Prince!
like a poisoned arrow, like a deadly snake, O lord of  
   kine!  
  Dire is the Brāhman's arrow: he pierces his enemies therewith.
