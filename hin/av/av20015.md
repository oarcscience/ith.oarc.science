### HYMN XV

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001501">1</span></span>To him most
liberal, lofty Lord of lofty wealth, verily powerful  
   and strong, I bring my hymn,  
  Whose checkless bounty, as of waters down a slope, is spread  
   abroad for all that live, to give them strength.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001502">2</span></span>Now all this
world, for worship, shall come after thee—the  
   offerer's libations like descending floods,  
  When the well-loved one seems to rest upon the hill, the thun-  
   derbolt of Indra, shatterer wrought of gold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001503">3</span></span>To him the
terrible, most worthy of high praise, like radiant  
  Dawn, bring gifts with reverence in this rite,  
  Whose being, for renown, yea, Indra-power and light, have been  
   created, like bay steeds, to move with speed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001504">4</span></span>Thine,
Indra, praised by many excellently rich! are we who  
   trusting in thy help draw near to thee.  
  Lover of praise, none else but thou receives our laud: as Earth  
   loves all her creatures, love thou this our hymn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001505">5</span></span>Great is thy
power, O Indra, we are thine. Fulfil, O Maghavan,  
   the wish of this thy worshipper.  
  After thee lofty heaven hath measured out its strength to thee  
   and to thy power this earth hath bowed itself.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001506">6</span></span>Thou, who
hast thunder for thy weapon, with thy bolt hast  
   shattered into pieces this broad massive cloud.  
  Thou hast sent down obstructed floods that they may flow: thou  
   hast, thine own for ever, all victorious might.
