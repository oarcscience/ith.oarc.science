### HYMN VII

#### A charm to deprecate Arāti or Malignity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500701">1</span></span>Bring thou
to us, bar not the way, Arāti! Stay not the guerdon  
   that is being brought us.  
  Homage be paid to Failure, to Misfortune, and Malignity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500702">2</span></span>The man whom
thou preferrest, O Arāti, he who prates to us—  
  This man of thine, we reverence. Baffle not thou my heart's  
   desire,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500703">3</span></span>May our
desire which Gods have roused fulfil itself by day and  
   night.  
  We seek to win Arāti: to Arāti be our homage paid.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500704">4</span></span>We,
suppliant, call on Bhaga, on Sarasvati, Anumati,  
  Pleasant words have I spoken, sweet as honey is, at invocations  
   of the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500705">5</span></span>The portion
that I crave with speech intelligent and full of  
   power,  
  May faith, presented with the gift of tawny Soma, find to-day.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500706">6</span></span>Do not thou
make our words or wishes fruitless. Let the twain  
  Indra Agni, bring us treasures.  
  All, fain to-day to give us gifts, welcome Arāti with your love. <span
id="page_a163">p. a163</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500707">7</span></span>Misfortune!
go thou far away: we turn thy harmful dart aside.  
  I know thee well, Arāti! as oppressor, one who penetrates.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500708">8</span></span>Oft, coming
as a naked girl thou hauntest people in their sleep,  
  Baffling the thought, Arāti! and the firm intention of a man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500709">9</span></span>To her the
mighty vast in size, who penetrates all points of  
   space,  
  To her mine homage have I paid, Nirriti with her golden hair.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500710">10</span></span>Auspicious,
with her golden hue, pillowed on gold, the mighty  
   one  
  To this Arāti clad in robes of gold mine homage have I paid.
