### HYMN VIII

#### Speculations on the Supreme Being and Cosmogonical and theological subjects

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000801">1</span></span>Worship to
loftiest Brahma, Lord of what hath been and what  
   shall be,  
  To him who rules the universe, and heavenly light is all his own!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000802">2</span></span>Upheld by
Skambha's power these two, the heaven and the earth,  
   stand fast.  
  Skambha is all this world of life, whatever breathes or shuts an.  
   eye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000803">3</span></span>Three
generations have gone by and vanished and others near  
   have entered into sunlight.  
  There stood on high he who metes out the region into green,  
   plants hath passed the Golden-coloured.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000804">4</span></span>One is the
wheel, the tires are twelve in number, the naves are  
   three What man hath understood it?  
  Three hundred spokes have thereupon been hammered, and sixty  
   pins set firmly in their places. <span id="page_28">p. 28</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000805">5</span></span>Discern thou
this, O Savitar. Six are the twins, one singly born.  
  They claim relationship in that among them which is born alone.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000806">6</span></span>Though
manifest, it lies concealed in the vast place they call the  
   old:  
  Therein is firmly stationed all the moving, breathing universe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000807">7</span></span>Up, eastward
downward in the west, ‘it rolleth, with countless  
   elements, one-wheeled, single-fellied.  
  With half it hath begotten all creation. Where hath the other half  
   become unnoticed?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000813">13</span></span>In front of
these the five-horsed car moves onward: side-horses,  
   harnessed with the others draw it.  
  No one hath seen its hither course untravelled; the height sees  
   it more near, the depth more distant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000809">9</span></span>The bowl
with mouth inclined and bottom upward holds stored  
   within it every form of glory.  
  Thereon together sit the Seven Rishis who have become this  
   mighty One's protectors  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000810">10</span></span>The Verse
employed at opening and conclusion, the Verse  
   employed in each and every portion;  
  That by which sacrifice proceedeth onward. I ask thee which is  
   that of all the Verses.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000811">11</span></span>That which
hath power of motion, that which flies, or stands,  
   which breathes or breathes not, which, existing, shuts the eye  
  Wearing all forms that entity upholds the earth, and in its close  
   consistence still is only one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000812">12</span></span>The
infinite to every side extended, the finite and the infinite  
   around us,  
  These twain Heaven's Lord divides as he advances, knowing the  
   past hereof and all the future  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000813">13</span></span>Within the
womb Prajāpati is moving: he, though unseen, is  
   born in sundry places.  
  He with one half engendered all creation. What sign is there to  
   tell us of the other?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000814">14</span></span>All men
behold him with the eye, but with the mind they know  
   not him.  
  Holding aloft the water as a water-bearer in her jar.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000815">15</span></span>With the
full vase he dwells afar, is left far off what time it fails,  
  A mighty Being in creation's centre: to him the rulers of the  
   realms bring tribute. <span id="page_29">p. 29</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000816">16</span></span>That,
whence the Sun arises, that whither he goes to take his  
   rest,  
  That verily I hold supreme: naught in the world surpasses it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000817">17</span></span>Those who
in recent times, midmost, or ancient, on all sides.  
   greet the sage who knows the Veda,  
  One and all, verily discuss Āditya, the second Agni, and the  
   threefold Hansa.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000818">18</span></span>This
gold-hued Haiisa's wings, flying to heaven, spread o'er a  
   thousand days' continued journey.  
  Supporting all the Gods upon his bosom, he goes his way behol-  
   ding every creature.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000819">19</span></span>By truth he
blazes up aloft by Brahma, he looks down below:  
  He breathes obliquely with his breath, he on whom what is.  
   highest rests.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000820">20</span></span>The sage
who knows the kindling-sticks whence by attrition  
   wealth is drawn,  
  Will comprehend what is most high, will know the mighty  
  Brāhmana.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000821">21</span></span>Footless at
first was he produced, footless he brought celestial  
   light.  
  Four-footed grown, and meet for use, he seized each thing  
   enjoyable.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000822">22</span></span>Useful will
he become, and then will he consume great store of  
   food  
  The man who humbly worshippeth the eternal and victorious  
  God.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000823">23</span></span>Him too
they call eternal; he may become new again to-day.  
  Day and Night reproduce themselves, each from the form the  
   other wears.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000824">24</span></span>A hundred,
thousand, myriad, yea a hundred million stores of  
   wealth that passes count are laid in him.  
  This wealth they kill as he looks on, and now this God shines  
   bright therefrom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000825">25</span></span>One is yet
finer than a hair, one is not even visible. And hence  
   the Deity who grasps with firmer hold is dear to me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000826">26</span></span>This fair
one is untouched by age, immortal in a mortal's house.  
  He for whom she was made lies low, and he who formed her  
   hath grown old.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000827">27</span></span>Thou art a
woman, and a man; thou art a damsel and a boy. <span id="page_30">p.
30</span>  
  Grown old thou totterest with a staff, new-born thou lookest  
   every way.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000828">28</span></span>Either the
sire or son of these, the eldest or the youngest child.  
  As sole God dwelling in the mind, first born, he still is in the  
   womb.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000829">29</span></span>Forth from
the full he lifts the full, the full he sprinkles with  
   the full.  
  Now also may we know the source from which the stream is  
   sprinkled round.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000830">30</span></span>Brought
forth in olden time, the everlasting, high over all that  
   is was she, the Ancient.  
  The mighty Goddess of the Morn, refulgent with one eye, looketh  
   round with one that winketh,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000831">31</span></span>Known by
the name of Guardian Grace the Deity sits girt by  
  Right.  
  The trees have taken from her hue, green-garlanded, their robe  
   of green.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000832">32</span></span>When he is
near she leaves him not, she sees him not though he  
   is near.  
  Behold the wisdom of the God; he hath not died, he grows not  
   old.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000833">33</span></span>Voices that
never were before emitted speak as fitteth them.  
  Whither they go and speak, they say there is the mighty Brāh-  
   mana.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000834">34</span></span>I ask thee
where the waters' flower by wondrous magic art was  
   placed,  
  Thereon the Gods and men are set as spokes are fastened in the  
   nave.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000835">35</span></span>Who gave
command unto the wind that blowet!  
  Who ranged the five united heavenly regions?  
  Who were the Gods who cared not for oblations!  
  Which of them brought the sacrificial waters?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000836">36</span></span>One God
inhabiteth the earth we live on; another hath encom-  
   passed air's mid-region.  
  One, the Supporter, takes the heaven and bears it: some keep-  
   ing watch guard all the quarters safely.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000837">37</span></span>The man who
knows the drawn-out string on which these crea-  
   tures all are strung,  
  The man who knows the thread's thread, he may know the  
   mighty Brāhmana. <span id="page_31">p. 31</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000838">38</span></span>I know the
drawn-out string, the thread whereon these creatures  
   all are strung.  
  I know the thread's thread also, thus I know the mighty Brah-  
   ma na.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000839">39</span></span>When Agni
passed between the earth and heaven devouring with  
   his flame the all-consumer,  
  Where dwelt afar the spouses of one husband, where at that  
   moment, where was Mātarisvan?  
  -40. Into the floods had Mātarisvan entered, the deities had past
in-  
   to the waters.  
  There stood the mighty measurer of the region: into the ver-  
   dant plants went Pavamāna.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000841">41</span></span>Over the
Gāyatri, above the immortal world he strode away.  
  Those who by Song discovered Song—where did the Unborn see  
   that thing?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000842">42</span></span>Luller to
rest, and gatherer-up of treasures, Savitar like a God  
   whose laws are constant, hath stood like Indra in the war for  
   riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000843">43</span></span>Men versed
in sacred knowledge know that living Being that  
   abides.  
  In the nine-portalled Lotus Flower, enclosed with triple bands  
   and bonds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000844">44</span></span>Desireless,
firm, immortal, self-existent, contented with the es-  
   sence, lacking nothing,  
  Free from the fear of Death is he who knoweth that Soul cou-  
   rageous, youthful, undecaying.
