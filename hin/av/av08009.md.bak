### HYMN IX

#### An enunciation of cosmogonical, ritual, and metrical doctrine

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800901">1</span></span>Whence were
these two produced? which was that region?'  
  From what world, from which earth had they their being?  
  Calves of Virāj, these two arose from water. I ask thee of these  
   twain, who was their milker.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800902">2</span></span>He who
prepared a threefold home, and lying there made the  
   water bellow through his greatness,  
  Calf of Virāj, giving each wish fulfilment, made bodies for him-  
   self far off, in secret.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800903">3</span></span>Which are
the three, the mighty three, whereof the fourth divides  
   the voice,  
  This may the Brāhman know by prayer and fervour, whereto  
   belongs the one, whereto the other.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800904">4</span></span>Out of the
Brihat as the sixth five Salmons have been fashioned  
   forth:  
  From Brihatī was Brihat formed: whence was the Brihatī com-  
   posed?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800905">5</span></span>On measure
Brihatī is based, and measure on the measurer:  
  From magic might came magic might, from magic might came  
  Mātali.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800906">6</span></span>Vaisvānara's
image is the sky above us, so far as Agni forced  
   both spheres asunder. <span id="page_a347">p. a347</span>  
  Thence from that region as the sixth come praise-songs, and  
   every sixth day hence again go upward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800907">7</span></span>We, Kagyapa!
six present Rishis, ask thee—for thou hast prov-  
   ed things tried and meet for trial  
  They call Virāj the Father of Devotion: tell her to us thy  
   friends in all her figures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800908">8</span></span>She whom,
advancing, sacrifices follow, and when she takes her  
   station stand beside her,  
  By whose control and hest the spirit moveth, she is Virāj, in  
   highest heaven, O Rishis.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800909">9</span></span>Breathless,
she moves by breath of living creatures, Svarāj pre-  
   cedes, Virāj comes closely after.  
  Some men behold her not, and some behold her, Virāj meet-  
   shaped, who thinks of all existence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800910">10</span></span>Who hath
perceived Virāj's duplication, perceived her seasons  
   and her rule and practice?  
  Who knows her steps, how oft, how far extended, who knows  
   her home and number of her dawnings?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800911">11</span></span>She here
who first of all sent forth her lustre moves onward  
   resting on these lower creatures.  
  Exalted power and might are stored within her: the woman  
   hath prevailed, the new-come mother.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800912">12</span></span>Both Dawns
on wings of song, with rich adornment, move on  
   together to their common dwelling.  
  Sūrya's two wives, unwasting, most prolific, knowing their way,  
   move, rich in light, together.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800913">13</span></span>The three
have passed along the path of Order—three warm  
   libations have regarded offspring  
  One quickens progeny, one strengthens vigour, and one protects  
   the kingdom of the pious.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800914">14</span></span>She who was
fourth was made by Agni, Soma, and Rishis as.  
   they formed both halves of worship,  
  Gāyatrī, Trishtup, Jagatī, Anushtup, Brihadarki lightening the  
   sacrificer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800915">15</span></span>Five
milkings answer to the fivefold dawning, five seasons to  
   the cow who bears five titles.  
  The five sky-regions made fifteen in number, one head have  
   these to one sole world directed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800916">16</span></span>Six
Elements arose, first-born of Order: the six-day time is  
   carried by six Sāmans. <span id="page_a348">p. a348</span>  
  Six-yoked the plough is, as each trace is numbered: they call  
   both broad ones six; six, Earth and Heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800917">17</span></span>They call
the cold months six, and six the hot ones. Which, tell  
   us, of the seasons is redundant?  
  Seven sages, eagles, have sat down together: seven metres  
   match the seven Consecrations.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800918">18</span></span>Seven are
the Homas, seven the logs for burning, seven are the  
   streams of mead, and seven the seasons.  
  Into the world have come seven streams of butter; those we  
   have heard of as the Seven Vultures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800919">19</span></span>Seven
metres, by four syllables increasing, each of the seven  
   founded upon another  
  How are the hymns of praise on these supported, and how are  
   these imposed upon the praise-songs?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800920">20</span></span>How hath
the Gāyatri filled out three triads? On the fifteen  
   how is the Trishtup moulded,  
  Jagatī fashioned on the three-and-thirty? How is Anushtup  
   formed? how Ekavinsa?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800921">21</span></span>Eight
Elements sprang up, first born of Order: the Priests  
   divine are eight in number, Indra!  
  Eight are the wombs of Aditi, eight her children; for the eighth  
   night is the libation destined.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800922">22</span></span>So planning
bliss for you have I come hither to win your  
   friendship: kind am I, and gracious.  
  Born from one source, propitious is your wisdom: knowing  
   full well to all of you it cometh.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800923">23</span></span>To Indra
eight, to Yama six, seven to the Rishis, seven to  
   each:  
  The number five accompanies waters and men and healing  
   herbs.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800924">24</span></span>The Heifer,
all his own, poured forth for Indra control and  
   milk at her first time of milking;  
  And he then satisfied the four divisions, the Gods and men and  
  Asuras and Rishis.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800925">25</span></span>Who is the
Cow? Who is the Single Rishi? What is the law,  
   what are the benedictions?  
  What on the earth is the one only Spirit? Which of the number  
   is the Single Season?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800926">26</span></span>One is the
Cow, one is the Single Spirit, one is the law, single  
   are benedictions. <span id="page_a349">p. a349</span>  
  The Spirit dwelling on the earth is single: the Single Season  
   never is transcended.
