### HYMN XXX

#### A benediction on a King at his consecration

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103001">1</span></span>Guard and
protect this man, all Gods and Vasus. Over him keep-  
   ye watch and ward, Ādityas.  
  Let not death reach him from the hands of brothers from hands  
   of aliens, or of human beings.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103002">2</span></span>Listen,
one-minded, to the word I, utter, the sons, O Gods,  
   among you, and the fathers!  
  I trust this man to all of you: preserve him happily, and to  
   length of days conduct him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103003">3</span></span>All Gods who
dwell on earth or in the heavens, in air, within.  
   the plants, the beasts, the waters,  
  Grant this man life to full old age, and let him escape the  
   hundred other ways of dying. <span id="page_a28">p. a28</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103004">4</span></span>You,
claiming Anuyājas or Prayājas, sharers, or not consumers,  
   of oblation,  
  You, to whom heaven's five regions are apportioned, I make  
   companions at his sacred sessions.
