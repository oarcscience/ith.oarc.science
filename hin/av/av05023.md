### HYMN XXIII

#### A charm against parasitic worms

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502301">1</span></span>I have
called Heaven and Earth to aid, have called divine  
  Sarasvati,  
  Indra and Agni have I called: Let these destroy the worm, I  
   prayed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502302">2</span></span>O Indra,
Lord of Treasures, kill the worms that prey upon this  
   boy.  
  All the malignant spirits have been smitten by my potent spell. <span
id="page_a185">p. a185</span>  
  We utterly destroy the worm, the worm that creeps around the  
   eyes.  
  The worm that crawls about the nose, the worm that gets bet-  
   ween the teeth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502303">3</span></span>Two of like
colour, two unlike, two coloured black, two  
   coloured red.  
  The tawny and the tawny-eared, Vulture and Wolf, all these  
   are killed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502304">4</span></span>Worms that
are white about the sides, those that are black with  
   black-hued arms,  
  All that show various tints and hues, these worms we utterly  
   destroy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502305">5</span></span>Eastward the
Sun is mounting, seen of all, destroying thing  
   unseen,  
  Crushing and killing all the worms invisible and visible.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502306">6</span></span>Let the
Yevāshas, Kaskashas, Ejatkas, Sipavitnukas,  
  Let both the worm that we can see, and that we see not, be  
   destroyed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502307">7</span></span>Slain the
Yevāsha of the worms, slain too is the Nadaniman.  
  I have reduced them all to dust like vetches with the pounding-  
   stone.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502308">8</span></span>The worm
Sāranga, white of hue, three-headed, with a triple  
   hump,  
  I split and tear his ribs away, I wrench off every head he has.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502309">9</span></span>I kill you,
worms, as Atri, as Kanva and Jamadagni killed.  
  I crush the worms to pieces with a spell that erst Agastya used.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502310">10</span></span>The King of
worms hath been destroyed, he who was lord of  
   these is slain.  
  Slain is the worm whose mother, whose brother and sister have  
   been slain.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502311">11</span></span>Destroyed
are his dependants, who those dwell around him are  
   destroyed,  
  And all the worms that seem to be the little ones are done to  
   death  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502312">12</span></span>Of every
worm and insect, of the female and the male alike,  
  I crush the head to pieces with a stone and burn the face with  
   fire.
