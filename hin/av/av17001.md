<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700115">15</span></span>Round
Trita, round the spring with thousand currents thou  
   goest, round the light-finding assembly.  
  Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700116">16</span></span>Thou
guardest well the four celestial regions, pervading heaven,

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700118">18</span></span>Indra art
thou, Mahendra thou, thou art the world, the Lord of  
  Life.  
  To thee is sacrifice performed: worshippers offer gifts to thee.  
  Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700119">19</span></span>What is
based on what is not: the present lies on that which is..  
  Present on future is imposed and future on the present based.  
  Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.  
  Sate us with cattle of all varied colour. Set me in happiness, in  
   loftiest heaven. <span id="page_172">p. 172</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700120">20</span></span>Bright art
thou, and refulgent: as thou shinest with splendour  
   so I fain would shine with splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700121">21</span></span>Lustre art
thou, illuming: as thou glowest with lustre so I too  
   would shine with cattle, with all the lustre of a Brāhman's  
   station.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700122">22</span></span>Glory to
him when rising, when ascending! Glory to him when  
   he hath reached the zenith!  
  To him far-shining, him the self-refulgent, to him the Sovran  
  Lord and King be glory!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700123">23</span></span>Worship to
him when he is turning westward, to him when set-  
   ting, and when set be worship!  
  To him far-shining, him the self-refulgent, to him the Sovran  
  Lord and King be glory!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700124">24</span></span>With all
his fiery fervour this Āditya hath gone up on high,  
  Giving my foes into my hand. Let me not by my foeman's prey.  
  Manifold are thy great deeds, thine, O Vishnu.  
  Sate us with cattle of all varied colours. Set me in happiness, in  
   loftiest heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700125">25</span></span>Thou for
our weal, Āditya, hast mounted thy ship with hundred  
   oars.  
  Thou hast transported me to day: so bear me evermore to  
   night.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700126">26</span></span>Thou for
our weal, O Sūrya, hast mounted thy ship with hundred  
   oars.  
  Thou hast transported me to night: so bear me evermore to  
   day.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700127">27</span></span>Encompassed
by Prajāpati's devotion as shield, with Kasyapa's  
   bright light and splendour,  
  Reaching old age, may I made strong and mighty live through a  
   thousand years with happy fortune.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700128">28</span></span>Compassed
am I with prayer, my shield and armour; compassed  
   with Kasyapa's bright light and splendour.  
  Let not shafts reach me shot from heaven against me, nor those  
   sent forth by men for my destruction.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700129">29</span></span>Guarded am
I by Order and the Seasons, protected by the past  
   and by the future.  
  Let not distress, yea, let not Death come nigh me: with water  
   of my speech have I o'erwhelmed them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1700130">30</span></span>On every
side let Agni guard and keep me; the rising Sun drive  
   off the snares of Mrityu! <span id="page_173">p. 173</span>  
  Let brightly flushing Mornings, firm-set mountains, and lives a  
   thousand be with me united.
