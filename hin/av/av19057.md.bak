### HYMN LVII

#### A charm against evil dreams

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905701">1</span></span>As men
discharge the utmost debt, collect the eighth and  
   sixteenth part,  
  So to the foeman we transfer together all the evil dream.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905702">2</span></span>Princes came
together, debts came together, Kushthas came to-  
   gether,  
  Sixteenths came together. The whole evil dream that hath visited  
   us we send away as a bad dream to the man who hates us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905703">3</span></span>Child of
Gods' Consorts, minister of Yama is the good Dream:  
   that which is my trouble we drive away to the enemy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905704">4</span></span>Thou whose
name is Rough art the mouth of the Black Bird.  
  As such we know thee, Dream, as such we know thee well. Like  
   a horse art thou, O Dream. As they bind girth and surcingle  
   on a horse, so bind the alien mischief-maker, the scorner of  
   the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905705">5</span></span>The evil
dream that threatens us, threatens our cattle or our  
   home.  
  That let the scorner of the Gods, the alien mischief-maker bind  
   as a gold jewel round his neck.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905706">6</span></span>Having
measured off nine cubits' distance from us we give away  
   the whole of the evil dream to the man who hates us.
