### HYMN XCIV

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009401">1</span></span>May Sovran
Indra come to the carousal, he who by holy Law is  
   strong and active.  
  The overcomer of all conquering forces with his great bull-like  
   power that hath no limit.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009402">2</span></span>Firm-seated
is thy car, thy steeds are docile: thy hand, O King,  
   holds, firmly grasped, the thunder.  
  On thy fair path, O Lord of men, come quickly: we will increase  
   thy power when thou hast drunken.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009403">3</span></span>Let strong
and mighty steeds who bear this mighty Indra, the  
  Lord of men, whose arm wields thunder,  
  Bring unto us, as shares of our banquet, the Bull of conquering  
   might, of real vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009404">4</span></span>So like a
bull thou rushest to the Lord who loves the trough,  
   the Sage, the prop of vigour, in the vat.  
  Prepare thine energies, collect them in thyself: be for our profit  
   as the Master of the wise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009405">5</span></span>May precious
treasures come to us,— so will I pray. Come to the  
   votary's gift offered with beauteous laud.  
  Thou art the Lord, as such sit on this holy grass: thy vessels  
   are inviolate as Law commands.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009406">6</span></span>Far went our
earliest invocations of the Gods, and won us  
   glories that can never be surpassed.  
  They who could not ascend the ship of sacrifice sink down in  
   desolation, trembling with alarm.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009407">7</span></span>So be the
others, evil-hearted, far away, whose horses difficult to  
   harness have been yoked.  
  Here in advance man stand anear to offer gifts, by whom full  
   many a work that brings reward is done.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009408">8</span></span>He firmly
fixed the plains and mountains as they shook. Dyaus  
   thundered forth and made the air's mid-region quake.  
  He stays apart the two confronting bowls; he sings lauds in the  
   potent Soma's joy when he hath drunk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009409">9</span></span>I bear this
deftly-fashioned goad of thine wherewith thou,  
  Maghavan, shalt break the strikers with the hoof. <span
id="page_342">p. 342</span>  
  At the libation mayst thou be well satisfied. Partake the juice,  
   partake the banquet, Bounteous Lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009410">10</span></span>O
Much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with  
   store of grain and cattle.  
  May we allied, as first in rank, with princes, obtain possessions  
   by our own exertions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009411">11</span></span>Brihaspati
protect us from the rearward, and from above, and  
   from below, from sinners!  
  May Indra from the front and from the centre, as friend to  
   friends, vouchsafe us room and freedom.
