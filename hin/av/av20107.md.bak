### HYMN CVII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010701">1</span></span>Before his
hot displeasure all the peoples, all the men bow  
   down,  
  As rivers bend them to the sea.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010702">2</span></span>This power
of his shone brightly forth when Indra brought to-  
   gether like  
  A skin the worlds of earth and heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010703">3</span></span>The
fiercely-moving Vritra's head he severed with his thunder-  
   bolt,  
  His hundred-knotted thunderbolt.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010704">4</span></span>In all the
worlds That was the best and highest whence sprang  
   the mighty God, of splendid valour.  
  As soon as born he overcomes his foemen, he in whom all who  
   lend him aid are joyful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010705">5</span></span>Grown mighty
in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe  
   strikes fear into the Dāsa,  
  Eager to win the breathing and the breathless. All sang thy  
   praise at banquet and oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010706">6</span></span>All
concentrate on thee their mental vigour, what time these,  
   twice or thrice, are thine assistants.  
  Blend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness: win quickly  
   with our meath that meath in battle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010707">7</span></span>Therefore in
thee too, thou who winnest riches, at every banquet  
   are the sages joyful  
  With mighter power, bold God, extend thy firmness: let not  
   malignant Yātudhānas harm thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010708">8</span></span>Proudly we
put our trust in thee in battles, when we behold great  
   wealth the prize of combat.  
  I with my words impel thy weapons onward, and sharpen with  
   my prayer thy vital vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010709">9</span></span>Worthy of
praises many-shaped, most skilful, most energetic,  
  Āptya of the Aptyas: <span id="page_351">p. 351</span>  
  He with his might destroys the seven Dānus, subduing many  
   who were deemed his equals.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010710">10</span></span>Thou in
that house which thy protection guardedh bestowest-  
   wealth, the higher and the lower.  
  Thou stablishest the two much-wandering Mothers, and bringest  
   many deeds to their completion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010711">11</span></span>Brihaddiva,
the foremost of light-winners, repeasts these holy  
   prayers, this strength to Indra.  
  He rules the great self-luminous fold of cattle, and all the doors  
   of light hath he thrown open.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010712">12</span></span>Thou hath
Brihaddiva the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as  
   himself in person.  
  The Mātarisvarīs, the spotless sisters, with power exalt him and  
   impel him onward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010713">13</span></span>Bright,
Presence of the Gods, the luminous herald, Siirya hath  
   mounted the celestial regions.  
  Day's maker, he hath shone away the darkness, and radiant  
   passed o'er places hard to traverse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010714">14</span></span>The
brilliant Presence of the Gods hath risen, the eye of Mitra,  
  Varuna, and Agni.  
  The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, Sūrya hath filled the  
   earth and air and heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010715">15</span></span>Even as a
lover followeth a maiden, so doth the Sun the Dawn,  
   refulgent Goddess:  
  Where pious men extend their generations before the Gracious  
  One for happy fortune.
