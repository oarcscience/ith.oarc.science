### HYMN LX

#### A parting traveller's address to the houses of his village

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0706001">1</span></span>I, prudent,
bringing power, a treasure-winner, with amicable  
   eye that strikes no terror,  
  Come, praising and kind-thoughted, to these houses: be not  
   afraid of me, be glad and joyful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0706002">2</span></span>Let these
delightful Houses that are rich in power and store of  
   milk,  
  Replete with wealth and standing firm, become aware of our  
   approach.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0706003">3</span></span>These Houses
we invoke, whereon the distant exile sets his  
   thought, <span id="page_a296">p. a296</span>  
  Wherein dwells many a friendly heart: let them beware of our  
   approach.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0706004">4</span></span>Thus
greeted, ye of ample wealth, friends who enjoy delightful  
   sweets.  
  Be ever free from hunger, free from thirst! Ye Houses, fear us  
   not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0706005">5</span></span>Kind
greeting to the cattle here, kind greeting to the goats and  
   sheep!  
  Then, of the food within our homes, kind greeting to the plea-  
   sant drink!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0706006">6</span></span>Full of
refreshment, full of charms, of laughter and felicity,  
  Be ever free from hunger, free from thirst! Ye Houses, fear us  
   not.  
  Stay here, and come not after me: prosper in every form and  
   shape.  
  With happy fortune will I come! Grow more abundant still  
   through me!
