### HYMN LVIII

#### A prayer for prosperity, accompanying a sacrifice

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905801">1</span></span>Still equal
be the flow of butter ever causing the Year to prosper  
   with oblation.  
  Still be our hearing, sight, and breath uninjured: let us lose  
   nothing of our life and vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905802">2</span></span>Let lively
breath invite us: we call vital breath to visit us.  
  Earth and air's middle realm have gathered, Soma, Brihaspati  
   and Dhartar gathered vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905803">3</span></span>The earth
and heaven have come to be two gatherers up of vigo-  
   rous might.  
  So let us gather vigour up and closely follow after Earth.  
  With glory come the cows and stand beside the master of the  
   herd. Let us when we have gathered fame and glory closely  
   follow Earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905804">4</span></span>Prepare the
cow-stall, for there drink your heroes: stitch ye the  
   coats of armour wide and many.  
  Make iron forts defying all assailants: let not your pitcher leak;  
   stay it securely.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905805">5</span></span>The eye of
sacrifice, source and beginning with voice, car, spirit  
   unto him I offer.  
  To this our sacrifice, wrought by Visvakarman, may the Gods  
   come gracious and kindly-hearted.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905806">6</span></span>Let the
Gods' Priests and those who merit worship, to whom  
   oblation as their share is offered,  
  Come to this holy service with their Consorts, and all Gods  
   revel in the food we bring them.
