### HYMN I

#### On the Bridal of Sūryā, marriage ceremonies in general

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400101">1</span></span>Truth is the
base that bears the earth; by Sūrya are the heavens  
   upheld.  
  By Law the Ādityas stand secure, and Soma holds his place in  
   heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400102">2</span></span>By Soma are
the Ādityas strong, by Soma mighty is the earth:  
  Thus Soma in the lap of all these constellations hath his home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400103">3</span></span>One thinks,
when men have brayed the plant, that he hath drunk  
   the Soma's juice.  
  Of him whom Brāhmans truly know as Soma never mortal eats.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400104">4</span></span>When they
begin to drink thee, then, O God, thou swellest out  
   again.  
  Vāyu in Soma's sentinel. The month is that which shapes the  
   years.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400105">5</span></span>Soma,
preserved by covering rules, guarded by hymns in Brihatī,  
  Thou standest listening to the stones; none tastes of thee who  
   dwells on earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400106">6</span></span>Thought was
her coverlet, the power of sight was unguent for her  
   eyes:  
  Her treasure-chest was earth and heaven, when Sūryā went unto  
   her lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400107">7</span></span>Raibhi was
her dear bridal friend, and Nārāsatisi led her home.  
  Lovely to see was Sūryā's robe: by Gāthā beautified she moves  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400108">8</span></span>Songs were
the cross-bars of the pole, Kurira metre docked her  
   head.  
  Both Asvins were the paranymphs: Agni was leader of the  
   train.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400109">9</span></span>Soma was he
who wooed the maid: the groomsmen were both.  
  Asvins, when  
  The Sun-God Savitar bestowed his willing Sūryā on her lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400110">10</span></span>Her spirit
was the bridal car, the canopy thereof was heaven:  
  Two radiant oxen formed the team when Sūryā came unto her  
   lord. <span id="page_130">p. 130</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400111">11</span></span>Steadily
went the steers upheld by holy verse and song of praise,  
  The chariot-wheels were listening ears: thy path was tremulous  
   in the sky.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400112">12</span></span>Pure, as
thou wentest, were thy wheels, breath was the axle pier-  
   cing them.  
  Sūryā advancing to her lord rode on the chariot of her heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400113">13</span></span>The bridal
pomp of Sūryā, which Savitar started, moved along.  
  In Maghā days are oxen slain, in Phalgunis they wed the bride.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400114">14</span></span>When on
your three-wheeled chariot, O ye Asvins, ye came as  
   suitors unto Sūrya's bridal,  
  Where was one chariot-wheel of yours? Where stood ye for the  
   sire's command?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400115">15</span></span>Twin Lords
of Lustre, at the time when ye to Sūryā's wooing  
   came,  
  Then all the Gods agreed to your proposal Pūshan as son elected  
   you as father.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400116">16</span></span>Two wheels
of thine the Brāhmans know, Sūrya! according to  
   their times.  
  That which is hidden only those who know the highest truths  
   have learned.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400117">17</span></span>Worship we
pay to Aryaman, finder of husbands, kindly friend.  
  As from its stalk a cucumber, from here I loose thee, not from  
   there  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400118">18</span></span>Hence and
not thence I send her free. I make her softly fettered  
   there.  
  That, bounteous Indra! she may live blest in her fortune and  
   her sons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400119">19</span></span>Now from
the noose of Varuna I free thee, where with the bless-  
   ed Savitar hath bound thee.  
  May bless be thine together with thy wooer in Order's dwelling,  
   in the world of virtue.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400120">20</span></span>Let Bhaga
take thy hand and hence conduct thee: let the two  
  Asvins on their car transport thee.  
  Go to the house to be the household's mistress, and speak as  
   lady to thy gathered people.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400121">21</span></span>Happy be
thou and prosper with thy children here: be vigilant  
   to rule the household in this home.  
  Closely unite thy body with this man thy lord. So shalt thou,  
   full of years, address thy company. <span id="page_131">p.
131</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400122">22</span></span>Be not
divided; dwell ye here; reach the full time of human  
   life.  
  With sons and grandsons sport and play, rejoicing in your happy  
   home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400123">23</span></span>Moving by
magic power from east to westward, these children  
   twain go sporting round the ocean.  
  The one beholds all creatures: thou, the other, art born anew,  
   duly arranging seasons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400124">24</span></span>Thou, born
afresh, art new and new for ever; ensign of days,  
   before the Dawns thou goest.  
  Coming, thou orderest for Gods their portion. Thou lengthenest,  
  Moon, the days of our existence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400125">25</span></span>Give thou
the wollen robe away: deal treasure to the Brāhman-  
   priests.  
  This Witchery hath got her feet: the wife attendeth on her lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400126">26</span></span>It turneth
dusky-red: the witch who clingeth close is driven off.  
  Well thrive the kinsmen of this bride: the husband is bound  
   fast in bonds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400127">27</span></span>Unlovely is
his body when it glistens with that wicked fiend,  
  What time the husband wraps about his limbs the garment of  
   his wife.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400128">28</span></span>The
butchering, the cutting-up, the severing of limb and joint—  
  Behold the forms which Sūryā wears: yet these the Brāhman  
   purifies,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400129">29</span></span>Pungent is
this, bitter is this, filled as it were with arrow barbs,  
   empoisoned and not fit for use.  
  The Brāhman who knows Sūryā well deserves the garment of  
   the bride.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400130">30</span></span>The Brāhman
takes away the robe as a fair thing that brings good  
   luck.  
  He knows the expiating rite whereby the wife is kept unharmed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400131">31</span></span>Prepare, ye
twain, happy and prosperous fortune, speaking the  
   truth in faithful utterances.  
  Dear unto her, Brihaspati, make the husband, and pleasant be  
   these words the wooer speaketh.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400132">32</span></span>Remain ye
even here and go no farther: strengthen this man, ye  
  Cows, with plenteous offspring.  
  May Dawns that come for glory, bright with Soma, here may all  
  Gods fix and enchant your spirits. <span id="page_132">p. 132</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400133">33</span></span>Come, O ye
Cows, with offspring dwell around him: he doth not  
   stint the Gods' alloted portion.  
  To him, your friend, may Pūshan, all the Maruts, to him may  
  Dhatar, Savitar send vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400134">34</span></span>Straight in
direction be the paths, and thornless, whereby our  
   fellows travel to the wooing.  
  With Bhaga and with Aryaman Dhātar endue the pair with  
   strength!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400135">35</span></span>Whatever
lustre is in dice, whatever lustre is in wine,  
  Whatever lustre is in cows, Asvins, endue this dame therewith.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400136">36</span></span>With all
the sheen that balmeth wine, or thigh of female para-  
   mour,  
  With all the sheen that balmeth dice, even with this adorn the  
   dame.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400137">37</span></span>He who in
water shines unfed with fuel, whom sages worship in  
   their sacrifices.  
  May he, the Waters' Child, send us sweet waters those that en-  
   hanced the power of mighty Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400138">38</span></span>I cast away
a handful here, hurtful, injurious to health.  
  I lift another handful up, sparkling and bringing happiness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400139">39</span></span>Hither let
Brāhmans bring her bathing water; let them draw  
   such as guards the lives of heroes.  
  Aryaman's fire let her encircle, Pūshan! Fathers-in-law stand,  
   with their sons, expectant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400140">40</span></span>Blest be
the gold to thee, and blest the water, blest the yoke's  
   opening, and blest the pillar.  
  Blest he the waters with their hundred cleansings: blest be thy  
   body's union with thy husband.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400141">41</span></span>Cleansing
Apālā, Indra! thrice, thou gavest sunbright skin to  
   her  
  Drawn, Satakratu! through the hole of car, of wagon, and of  
   yoke.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400142">42</span></span>Saying thy
prayer for cheerfulness, children, prosperity, and  
   wealth,  
  Devoted to thy husband, gird thyself for immortality.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400143">43</span></span>As vigorous
Sindhu won himself imperial lordship of the  
   streams,  
  So be imperial queen when thou hast come within thy husband's  
   home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400144">44</span></span>Over thy
husband's fathers and his brothers be imperial queen. <span
id="page_133">p. 133</span>  
  Over thy husband's sister and, his mother bear supreme control.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400145">45</span></span>They who
have spun, and woven, and extended Goddesses who  
   have drawn the ends together,  
  May they invest thee for full long existence. Heiress of lengthen-  
   ed life, endue this garment,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400146">46</span></span>They mourn
the living, they arrange the sacred rite: the men  
   have set their thoughts upon a distant cast:  
  They who have brought the Fathers this delightful gift, when  
   wives allowed their lords the joy of their embrace.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400147">47</span></span>I place
upon the lap of Earth the Goddess, a firm auspicious  
   stone to bring thee children.  
  Stand on it, thou, greeted with joy, resplendent: a long long  
   life may Savitar vouchsafe thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400148">48</span></span>As Agni in
the olden time took the right hand of this our Earth.  
  Even so I take and hold thy hand: be not disquieted, with me,  
   with children and with store of wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400149">49</span></span>God Savitar
shall take thy hand, and Soma the King shall make  
   thee rich in goodly offspring,  
  Let Agni, Lord Omniscient, make thee happy, till old old age a  
   wife unto thy husband.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400150">50</span></span>I take thy
hand in mine for happy fortune that thou mayst reach  
   old age with me thy consort,  
  Gods, Aryaman, Bhaga, Savitar, Purandhi, have given thee to be  
   my household's mistress.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400151">51</span></span>Bhaga and
Savitar the God have clasped that hand of thine in  
   theirs,  
  By rule and law thou art my wife: the master of thy house am I.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400152">52</span></span>Be it my
care to cherish her: Brihaspati hath made thee mine.  
  A hundred autumns live with me thy husband, mother of my  
   sons!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400153">53</span></span>Tvashtar,
by order of the holy sages, hath laid on her Brihas-  
   pati's robe for glory,  
  By means of this let Savitar and Bhaga surround this dame, like  
  Sūryā, with her children.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400154">54</span></span>May
Indra-Agni, Heaven-Earth, Mātarisvan, may Mitra-Varuna,  
  Bhaga, both the Asvins,  
  Brihaspati, the host of Maruts, Brahma, and Soma magnify this  
   dame with offspring.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400155">55</span></span>It was
Brihaspati who first arranged the hair on Sūryā's head, <span
id="page_134">p. 134</span>  
  And therefore, O ye Asvins, we adorn this woman for her lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400156">56</span></span>This lovely
form the maiden wears in spirit I long to look on  
   as my wife approaching,  
  Her will I follow with my nine companions. Who is the sage  
   that loosed the bonds that held her?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400157">57</span></span>I free her:
he who sees, within my bosom, my heart's nest  
   knows how her fair form hath struck me.  
  I taste no stolen food: myself untying Varuna's nooses I am  
   freed in spirit.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400158">58</span></span>Now from
the bond of Varuna I loose thee, wherein the blessed  
  Savitar hath bound thee.  
  O bride, I give thee here beside thy husband fair space and room  
   and pleasant paths to travel.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400159">59</span></span>Lift up
your weapons. Drive away the demons. Transport this  
   woman to the world of virtue.  
  Dilator, most wise, hath found for her a husband. Let him who  
   knows, King Bhaga, go before her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400160">60</span></span>Bhaga hath
formed the four legs of the litter, wrought the four  
   pieces that compose the frame-work.  
  Tvashtar hath decked the straps that go across it, May it be  
   blest, and bring us happy fortune.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400161">61</span></span>Mount this,
all-hued. gold tinted, strong wheeled, fashioned of  
  Kinsuka, this chariot lightly rolling,  
  Bound for the world of life immortal, Sūryā! Made for thy  
   lord a happy bride's procession.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400162">62</span></span>To us, O
Varuna, bring her, kind to brothers; bring her, Brihas-  
   pati, gentle to the cattle.  
  Bring her, O Indra, gentle to her husband: bring her to us, O  
  Savitar, blest with children.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400163">63</span></span>Hurt not
the girl, ye Pillars twain upon the path which Gods  
   have made.  
  The portal of the heavenly home we make the bride's auspicious  
   road.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400164">64</span></span>Let prayer
he offered up before and after, prayer in the middle,  
   lastly, all around her.  
  Reaching the Gods' inviolable castle shine in thy lord's world  
   gentle and auspicious.
