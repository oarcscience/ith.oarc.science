### HYMN LVI

#### A charm against poisonous bites and stings

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705601">1</span></span>Whether it
came from viper, from black snake or snake with  
   transverse stripes,  
  Or Kankaparvan's bite, this herb hath made the poison power-  
   less.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705602">2</span></span>Honey-born,
honey-dropping, rich in honey, honeysweet, this  
   herb,  
  Is medicine that heals the wound and kills the gnat that bites  
   and stings.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705603">3</span></span>Whatever
bit, or sucked thy blood, we summon thence away  
   from thee  
  The ineffectual poison of the little sharply-stinging gnat.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705604">4</span></span>Thou here
who crookest wicked jaws, thou tortuous, jointless,  
   limbless thing,  
  These jaws thou, Brāhmanaspati! shalt bend together like a  
   reed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705605">5</span></span>This
scorpion here that creeps along, low on the ground and  
   powerless— <span id="page_a294">p. a294</span>  
  I have removed his poison and then utterly demolished him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705606">6</span></span>No strength
in thy two arms hast thou, nor in thy head, nor in  
   thy waist:  
  Then what is that small thing thou so viciously bearest in thy  
   tail?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705607">7</span></span>The emmets
make a meal of thee and peahens tear and mangle  
   thee:  
  All ye are crying out, In sooth the scorpion's poison hath no  
   strength.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705608">8</span></span>Thou
creature who inflictest wounds both with thy mouth and  
   with thy tail,  
  No poison in thy mouth hast thou: what at thy tail's root will  
   there be?
