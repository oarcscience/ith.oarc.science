### HYMN III

#### An accompaniment to the preparation and presentation of sacrificial offerings by a householder and his wife, with prayer for prosperity and happiness on earth and in heaven

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200301">1</span></span>Mount, male
from male, the skin. Go thither: summon those  
   whom thou lovest, one and all, to meet thee,  
  Strong as ye were when first ye met each other, still be your  
   strength the same in Yama's kingdom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200302">2</span></span>So strong
your sight, so many be your powers, so great your  
   force, your energies so many,  
  When fire attends the body as its fuel, then may, ye gain full  
   chargers, O ye couple.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200303">3</span></span>Together in
this world, in God-ward pathway, together be ye in  
   the realms of Yama.  
  Invite, made pure with means of purifying, whatever seed of  
   yours hath been developed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200304">4</span></span>Do ye, O
sons, unite you with the waters, meeting this living  
   man, ye life-sustainers,  
  Allot to them the Odana your mother is making ready, which  
   they call immortal.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200305">5</span></span>That which
your mother and your sire, to banish sin and un-  
   cleanness from their lips, are cooking.  
  That Odana with hundred streams, sky-reaching, hath in its  
   might prevaded earth and heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200306">6</span></span>Live with
your sons, when life on earth is ended, live in the  
   sphere most rich in light and sweetness.  
  In skies that have been won by sacrificers make both the worlds,  
   earth, heaven, your habitation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200307">7</span></span>Approach the
eastern, yea: the eastern region, this is the  
   sphere to which the faithful turn them,  
  Your cooked oblation that in fire was offered, together, wife and  
   husband, meet to guard it. <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200308">8</span></span>Now, as your
steps approach the southern quarter, move in.  
   your circling course about this vessel.  
  Herein, accordant with the Fathers, Yama shall mightily protect  
   your cooked oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200309">9</span></span>Best of the
regions is indeed this western wherein the King and  
   gracious Lord is Soma.  
  Thither resort for rest, follow the pious. Then gain the laden  
   chargers, O ye couple.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200310">10</span></span>Ever
victorious is the northern region: may the east quarter set  
   us first and foremost.  
  The Man became the five-divisioned metre. May we abide wit .  
   all our members perfect.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200311">11</span></span>This
stedfast realm is Queen. To her be homage! To me and  
   to my sons may she be gracious.  
  Guard thou, O Goddess Aditi, all-bounteous, our cooked oblation  
   as an active warder.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200312">12</span></span>Embrace us
as a father clasps his children. Here on the Earth  
   let kindly breezes fan us.  
  Let the rice-mess these two cook here, O Goddess, know this  
   our truthfulness and zealous fervour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200313">13</span></span>If the dark
bird hath come to us and, stealing the hanging. .  
   morsel, settled in his dwelling,  
  Or if the slave-girl hath, wet-handed, smearing the pestle and  
   the mortar, cleansed the waters,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200314">14</span></span>This
pressing-stone, broad-based and strength-bestowing, made  
   pure by cleansing means, shall chase the demon.  
  Mount on the skin: afford us great protection, Let not the sons'  
   sin fall on wife and husband.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200315">15</span></span>Together
with the Gods, banning Pis5chas and demons, hath  
  Vanaspati come hither.  
  He shall rise up and send his voice out loudly. May we win all  
   the worlds with him to help us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200316">16</span></span>Seven
victims held the sacrificial essence, the bright one and the  
   one that hath grown feeble.  
  The three-and-thirty Deities attend them. As such, conduct us  
   io the world of Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200317">17</span></span>Unto the
world of Svarga shalt thou lead us: there may we dwell  
   beside our wife and children.  
  I take thy hand Let not Destruction, let not Malignity come  
   hither and subdue us. <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200318">18</span></span>We have
subdued that sinful-hearted Grāhi. Thou shalt speak  
   sweetly having chased the darkness.  
  Let not the wooden gear made ready fail us, nor harm the grain  
   of rice that pays due worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200319">19</span></span>Soon to be,
decked with butter, all-embracing, come to this  
   world wherewith birth unites thee.  
  Seize thou the winnowing-fan which rains have nourished, and  
   let this separate the chaff and refuse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200320">20</span></span>Three
worlds hath Power Divine marked out and measured,  
  Fheaven yonder, and the earth, and airs mid-region.  
  Grasp ye the stalks and in your hands retain them: let them be  
   watered and again be winnowed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200321">21</span></span>Manifold,
various are the shapes of victims. Thou growest uni-  
   form by great abundance.  
  Push thou away this skin of ruddy colour: the stone will cleanse  
   as one who cleanses raiment.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200322">22</span></span>Earth upon
earth l set thee. This thy body is con-substantial,.  
   but in form it differs.  
  Whate'er hath been worn off or scratched in fixing, leak not  
   thereat: I spread a charm to mend it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200323">23</span></span>Thou for
thy son shalt yearn as yearns a mother. I lay thee  
   down and with the earth unite thee.  
  Conjoined with sacrificial gear and butter may pot and jar stand  
   firmly on the altar.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200324">24</span></span>Eastward
may Agni as he cooks preserve thee. Southward may  
  Indra, grit by Maruts, guard thee,  
  Varuna strengthen and support thee westward, and Soma on  
   the north hold thee together.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200325">25</span></span>Drops flow,
made pure by filters, from the rain-cloud: to heaven  
   and earth and to the worlds they travel,  
  May Indra light them up, poured in the vessel, lively and sted-  
   fast, quickening living creatures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200326">26</span></span>From heaven
they come, they visit earth, and rising from earth  
   unite themselves with air's mid-region,  
  Purified, excellent, they with shine in beauty. Thus may they lead
us  
   to the world of Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200327">27</span></span>Yea, and
supreme, alike in conformation, and brilliant and  
   refulgent and immortal,  
  As such, enjoined, well-guarding, water-givers, dress ye the  
  Odana for wife and husband. <span id="page_92">p. 92</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200328">28</span></span>Numbered,
they visit earth, these drops of moisture, commensu-  
   rate with plants and vital breathings,  
  Unnumbered, scattered, beautiful in colour, the bright, ones  
   have pervaded all refulgence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200329">29</span></span>Heated,
they rage and boil in agitation, they cast about their  
   foam and countless bubbles  
  Like a fond woman when she sees her husband—what time ye  
   waters and these rice-grains mingle,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200330">30</span></span>Take up
these rice-grains lying at the bottom: led them be blent  
   and mingled with the waters.  
  This water I have measured in the vessel, if as mid-points the  
   rice-grains have been meted.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200331">31</span></span>Present the
sickle: quickly bring it hither. Let them out plants  
   and joints with hands that harm not.  
  So may the plants be free from wrath against us, they o'er  
   whose realm Soma hath won dominion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200332">32</span></span>Strew ye
fresh grass for the boiled rice to rest on: fair let it be,  
   sweet to the eye and spirit.  
  Hither come Goddesses with Gods, and sitting here taste in  
   proper season this oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200333">33</span></span>On the
strewn grass. Vanaspati, be seated; commensurate with  
  Gods and Agnishtomas.  
  Let thy fair form, wrought as by Tvashtar's hatchet, mark these  
   that yearn for thee within the vessel.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200334">34</span></span>In sixty
autumns may the Treasure-Guardian seek to gain  
   heavenly light by cooked oblation.  
  On this may sons and fathers live dependent. Send thou this  
   mess to Fire that leads to heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200335">35</span></span>On the
earth's breast stand firmly as supporter: may Deities  
   stir thee who ne'er hast shaken.  
  So living man and wife with living children remove thee from  
   the hearth of circling Agni.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200336">36</span></span>All wishes
that have blessed those with fulfilment, having won  
   all the worlds have met together.  
  Let them plunge in both stirring-spoon and ladle: raise this and  
   set it in a single vessel.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200337">37</span></span>Pour out
the covering butter, spread it eastward: sprinkle this  
   vessel over with the fatness.  
  Greet this, ye Deities, with gentle murmur, as lowing cows wel-  
   come their tender suckling. <span id="page_93">p. 93</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200338">38</span></span>Thou hast
poured oil and made the worlds: let heaven, unequal-  
   led, be spread out in wide extension.  
  Herein be cooked the buffalo, strong-pinioned: the Gods shall  
   give the Deities this oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200339">39</span></span>Whate'er
thy wife, away from thee, makes ready, or what, O  
   wife, apart from thee, thy husband,  
  Combine it all: let it be yours in common while ye produce one  
   world with joint endeavour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200340">40</span></span>All these
now dwelling on the earth, mine offspring, these whom,  
   this woman here, my wife, hath borne me,  
  Invite them all unto the vessel: knowing their kinship have the  
   children met together.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200341">41</span></span>Swollen
with savoury meath, the stream of treasures, sources of  
   immortality blent with fatness  
  Soma retains all these; in sixty autumns the Guardian Lord of  
  Treasures may desire them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200342">42</span></span>The Lord of
Treasures may desire this treasure: lordless on.  
   every side be all the others.  
  Our mess, presented seeking heaven, hath mounted in three  
   divisions all three realms of Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200343">43</span></span>May Agni
burn the God-denying demon: let no carnivorous.  
  Pis icha drink here.  
  We drive him off, we keep him at a distance. Ādityas and  
  Angirases pursue him!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200344">44</span></span>This meath
do I announce, mingled with butter, to the Angi-  
   rases and the Ādityas.  
  With pure hands ne'er laid roughly on a Brahman go, pious.  
   couple, to the world of Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200345">45</span></span>Of this
have I obtained the noblest portion from that same  
   world whence Parmeshthin gained it.  
  Pour forth, besprinkle butter rich in fatness: the share of  
  Angiras is here before us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200346">46</span></span>To Deities,
to Truth, to holy Fervour this treasure we consign,.  
   this rich deposit,  
  At play, in meeting led it not desert us, never give out to anyone  
   besides me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200347">47</span></span>I cook the
offering, I present oblation: only my wife attends  
   the holy service.  
  A youthful world, a son hath been begotten. Begin a life that  
   brings success and triumph. <span id="page_94">p. 94</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200348">48</span></span>There is no
fault in this, no reservation, none when it goes with  
   friends in close alliance.  
  We have laid down this vessel in perfection: the cooked mess  
   shall re-enter him who cooked it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200349">49</span></span>To those we
love may we do acts that please them. Away to  
   darkness go all those who hate us!  
  Cow, ox, and strength of every kind approach us! Thus let  
   them banish death of human beings.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200350">50</span></span>Perfectly
do the Agnis know each other, one visitor of plants  
   and one of rivers,  
  And all the Gods who shine and glow in heaven. Gold is the  
   light of him who cooks oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200351">51</span></span>Man hath
received this skin of his from nature: of other  
   animals not one is naked.  
  Ye make him clothe himself with might for raiment. Odana's  
   mouth is a home-woven vesture.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200352">52</span></span>Whatever
thou may say at dice, in meeting, whatever falsehood  
   through desire of riches,  
  Ye two, about one common warp uniting, deposit all impurity  
   within it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200353">53</span></span>Win thou
the rain: approach the Gods. Around thee thou from  
   the skin shalt make the smoke rise upward.  
  Soon to be, decked with butter, all-embracing, come to this  
   world wherewith one birth unites thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200354">54</span></span>In many a
shape hath heaven transformed its body, as in itself  
   is known, of varied eolour.  
  Cleansing the bright, the dark form hath it banished: the red  
   form in the fire to thee I offer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200355">55</span></span>To the
eastern region, to Agni the Regent, to Asita the Protector,  
  Āditya the Archer, we present thee, this offering of ours. Do  
   ye preserve it from aggression  
  To full old age may Destiny conduct us; may full old age deliver  
   us to Mrityu. Then may we be with our prepared oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200356">56</span></span>To the
southern region, to Indra the Regent, to Tiraschirāji the  
  Protector, to Yama the Archer, we present, etc. (as in stanza  
   55)  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200357">57</span></span>To the
western region, to Varuna the Regent, to Pridāku the  
  Protector, to Food the Archer, we present, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200358">58</span></span>To the
northern region, to Soma the Regent, to Svaja the Protec-  
   tor, to Thunderbolt the Archer, we present, etc. <span
id="page_95">p. 95</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200359">59</span></span>To the
stedfast region, to Vishnu the Regent, to Kalmāshagriva  
   the Protector, to Plants the Archers, we present, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200360">60</span></span>To the
upper region, to Brihaspati the Regent, to Svitra the  
  Protector, to Rain the Archer, we present thee, this offering  
   of ours. Do ye preserve it from aggression.  
  To full old age may Destiny conduct us, may full old age deliver  
   us to Mrityu. Then may we be with our prepared oblation.
