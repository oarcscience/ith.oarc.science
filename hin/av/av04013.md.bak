### HYMN XIII

#### A charm to restore a sick man to health

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401301">1</span></span>Gods, raise
again the man whom ye, O Gods, have humbled  
   and brought low.  
  Ye Gods, restore to life again, him, Gods! who hath committed  
   sin.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401302">2</span></span>Here these
two winds are blowing far as Sindhu from a distant  
   land.  
  May one breathe energy to thee, the other blow thy fault away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401303">3</span></span>Hither, O
Wind, blow healing balm, blow every fault away, thou  
  Wind!  
  For thou who hast all medicine comest as envoy of the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401304">4</span></span>May the Gods
keep and save this man, the Maruts' host deliver  
   him.  
  All things that be deliver him that he be freed from his offence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401305">5</span></span>I am come
nigh to thee with balms to give thee rest and keep  
   thee safe.  
  I bring thee mighty strength, I drive thy wasting malady away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401306">6</span></span>Felicitous
is this my hand, yet more felicitous is this.  
  This hand contains all healing balms, and this makes whole with  
   gentle touch.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401307">7</span></span>The tongue
that leads the voice precedes. Then with our tenfold-  
   branching hands.  
  With these two healers of disease, we stroke thee with a soft  
   caress.
