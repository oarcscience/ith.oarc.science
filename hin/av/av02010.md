life, in the midst of these I set thee. Away pass Nirriti,  
   away Consumption!

been freed from Phthisis and from trouble, from

   from Varuna's noose I thus release thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0201008">8</span></span>The Gods
have freed from, sinfulness, redeeming the Sun, the  
  Law from darkness and from Grāhi.  
  From family sickness, kinsmen's curse, Destruction, from Druh,  
   from Varuna's noose I thus release thee.  
  With spell and prayer I make thee pure and sinless: to thee be  
   both, the Earth and Heaven, auspicious!
