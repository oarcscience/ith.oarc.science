### HYMN I

#### On the preparation and use of holy water, with, a prayer for purification and freedom from sin

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600101">1</span></span>The Bull of
the Waters hath been let go; the heavenly fires have  
   been let go.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600102">2</span></span>Breaking,
breaking down, crushing, crushing to pieces,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600103">3</span></span>Mroka,
mind-destroying, rooting up, consuming, ruiner of the  
   soul, ruiner of the body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600104">4</span></span>Here I let
him go: thou washest me clean of him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600105">5</span></span>With this we
let him loose who hates us and whom we hate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600106">6</span></span>Thou art in
front of the waters. I let loose your sea.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600107">7</span></span>I let loose
the Agni who is within the waters, Mroka the up-  
   rooter, the destroyer of the body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600108">8</span></span>Your Agni
who entered into the waters, even he here is that very  
   dread of yours.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600109">9</span></span>May he
anoint you with Indra's own mighty power!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600110">10</span></span>May
stainless waters cleanse us from defilement.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600111">11</span></span>May they
carry sin away from us, may they carry away from us  
   the evil dream.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600112">12</span></span>Look on me
with a friendly eye, O, Waters, and touch my skin  
   with your auspicious body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600113">13</span></span>We call the
gracious Fires that dwell in waters. Goddesses, grant  
   me princely power and splendour.
