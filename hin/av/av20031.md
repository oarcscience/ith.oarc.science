### HYMN XXXI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003101">1</span></span>These two
dear Bays bring hither Indra on his car, thunder-  
   armed, joyous, meet for laud, to drink his fill.  
  Many libations flow for him who loveth them: to Indra have:  
   the gold-hued Soma juices run.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003102">2</span></span>The
gold-hued drops have flowed to gratify his wish: the yellow.  
   drops have urged the swift Bays to the Strong.  
  He who speeds on with bay steeds even as he lists hath satisfied  
   his longing for the golden drops.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003103">3</span></span>At the swift
draught the Soma-drinker waxed in might, the iron.  
  One with yellow beard and golden hair,  
  He, Lord of tawny coursers. Lord of fleet-foot mares, will bear  
   his bay steeds safely over all distress.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003104">4</span></span>His
yellow-coloured jaws, like ladles, move apart, what time,.  
   for strength, he makes the yellow-tinted stir,  
  When. while the bowl stands there, he grooms his tawny steeds,  
   when he hath drunk strong drink, the sweet juice that he:  
   loves.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003105">5</span></span>Yea, to the
dear one's seat in homes of heaven and earth the-  
   bay steeds' Lord hath whinnied like a horse for food.  
  Then the great wish hath seized upon him mightily, and the  
   beloved One hath gained high power of life.
