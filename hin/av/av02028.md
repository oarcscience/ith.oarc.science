### HYMN XXVIII

#### A prayer for a boy's long and happy life

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202801">1</span></span>This Child,
Old Age! shall grow to meet thee only: none of  
   the hundred other deaths shall harm him. <span id="page_a55">p.
a55</span>  
  From trouble caused by friends let Mitra guard him, as a kind  
   mother guards the son she nurses.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202802">2</span></span>Mitra or
Varuna the foe-destroyer, accordant, grant him death  
   in course of nature!  
  Thus Agni, Hotar-priest, skilled in high statutes, declareth all  
   the deities' generations.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202803">3</span></span>Thou art the
Lord of all terrestrial cattle, of cattle born and to  
   be born hereafter.  
  Let not breath drawn or breath emitted fail him. Let not his  
   friends, let not his foemen slay him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202804">4</span></span>Let Heaven
thy father and let Earth thy mother, accordant, give  
   thee death in course of nature,  
  That thou mayst live on Aditi's bosom, guarded, a hundred  
   winters, through thy respirations.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202805">5</span></span>Lead him to
life, O Agni, and to splendour, this dear child,  
  Varuna! and thou King Mitra!  
  Give him protection, Aditi! as a mother; All Gods, that his be  
   life of long duration;
