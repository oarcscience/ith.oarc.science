### HYMN XIX

#### The wickedness of robbing or insulting Brāhmans

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501901">1</span></span>The sons of
Vitahavya, the Srinjayas, waxed exceeding strong.  
  They well-nigh touched the heavens, but they wronged Bhrigu  
   and were overthrown.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501902">2</span></span>When men
pierced Brihatsāman through, the Brāhman, son of  
  Angiras,  
  The ram with teeth in both his jaws, the sheep, devoured their  
   progeny.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501903">3</span></span>If men have
spat upon, or shot their rheum upon a Brāhman,  
   they.  
  Sit in the middle of a stream running with blood, devouring  
   hair.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501904">4</span></span>While yet
the Brāhman's cow which men are dressing quivers in  
   her throe:  
  She mars the kingdom's splendour: there no vigorous hero  
   springs to life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501905">5</span></span>Terrible is
her cutting-up: her bitter flesh is cast away,  
  And it is counted sin among the Fathers if her milk is drunk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501906">6</span></span>If any King
who deems himself mighty would eat a Brāhman  
   up,  
  Rent and disrupted is that realm wherein a Brāhman is oppres-  
   sed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501907">7</span></span>She grows
eight-footed, and four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed,  
   two-faced, two-tongued,  
  And shatters down the kingdom of the man who doth the  
  Brāhman wrong.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501908">8</span></span>As water
swamps a leaky ship so ruin overflows that realm.  
  Misfortune smites the realm wherein a Brāhman suffers scath  
   and harm.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501909">9</span></span>The very
trees repel the man, and drive him from their sheltering  
   shade,  
  Whoever claims, O Nārada, the treasure that a Brāhman owns. <span
id="page_a179">p. a179</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501910">10</span></span>That
wealth, King Varuna hath said, is poison by the Gods  
   prepared.  
  None hath kept watch to guard his realm who hath devoured a  
  Brāhman's cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501911">11</span></span>Those
nine-and-ninety people whom Earth shook and cast away  
   from her,  
  When they had wronged the Brāhman race were ruined incon-  
   ceivably.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501912">12</span></span>Oppressor
of the Brāhmans! thus the Gods have spoken and  
   declared,  
  The step-effacing wisp they bind upon the dead shall be thy  
   couch.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501913">13</span></span>Oppressor
of the Brāhmans! tears wept by the man who suffers  
   wrong,  
  These are the share of water which the Gods have destined to be  
   thine.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501914">14</span></span>The share
of water which the Gods have destined to be thine, is  
   that,  
  Oppressor of the priest! wherewith men lave the corpse and wet  
   the beard.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501915">15</span></span>The rain of
Mitra-Varuna falls not on him who wrongs the  
   priest.  
  To him no counsel brings success: he wins, no friend to do his  
   will.
