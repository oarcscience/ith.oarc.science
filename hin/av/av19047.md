### HYMN XLVII

#### A hymn to Night for protection from fiends, robbers, snakes and wolves

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904701">1</span></span>Night! the
terrestrial realm hath been filled with the Father's  
   power and might.  
  Thou spreadest forth on high unto the seats of Heaven: dark-  
   ness that strikes with awe comes near.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904702">2</span></span>Each moving
thing finds rest in her whose yonder boundary is  
   not seen, nor that which keeps her separate.  
  O spacious, darksome Night, may we uninjured reach the end of  
   thee, reach, O thou blessed One, thine end.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904703">3</span></span>Thy
ninety-nine examiners, O Night, who look upon mankind,  
  Eighty-and-eight in number, or seven-and-seventy are they.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1904704">4</span></span>Sixty-and-six, O opulent, fifty-and-five,
O happy One,  
  Forty-and-four and thirty-three are they, O thou enriched with  
   spoil.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1904705">5</span></span>Twenty-and-two hast thou, O Night,
eleven, yea, and fewer still.  
  With these protectors guard us well. O Daughter of the Sky, to-  
   day.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904706">6</span></span>Let not a
fiends or spiteful man, let no ill-wisher master us.  
  Let not the robber seize our cows, nor the wolf take our sheep  
   today.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904707">7</span></span>Let not the
thief, O Blessed, seize our horses, nor she-fiends our  
   men.  
  Let thief and robber run away on pathways most remote from  
   us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904708">8</span></span>Far from us
let Rope with Fangs, far from us let the wicked  
   flee.  
  Do thou make blind and headless. Night, the serpent with his  
   pungent breath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904709">9</span></span>Crush the
wolf's jaws in pieces, strike the robber dead against a  
   post. <span id="page_250">p. 250</span>  
  In thee, O Night, do we abide: we here will sleep. Be watchful  
   thou.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904710">10</span></span>Give thou
protection to our kine; and to our horses, and our  
   men.
