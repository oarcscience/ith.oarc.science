### HYMN VII

#### Skambha, the Pillar or Fulcrum of all existence

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000701">1</span></span>Which of his
members is the seat of Fervour: Which is the base  
   of Ceremonial Order? <span id="page_21">p. 21</span>  
  Where in him standeth Faith? Where Holy Duty? Where, in  
   what part of him is truth implanted?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000702">2</span></span>Out of which
member glows the light of Agni? Form which  
   proceeds the breath of Mātarisvan?  
  From which doth Chandra measure out his journey, travelling  
   over Skambha's mighty body?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000703">3</span></span>Which of his
members is the earth's upholder? Which gives the  
   middle air a base to rest on?  
  Where, in which member is the sky established? Where hath  
   the space above the sky its dwelling?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000704">4</span></span>Whitherward
yearning blazeth Agni upward? Whitherward  
   yearning bloweth Mātarisvan?  
  Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom with long-  
   ing go the turning pathways?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000705">5</span></span>Whitheward
go the half-months, and, accordant with the full  
   year, the months in their procession?  
  Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom go seasons  
   and the groups of seasons?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000706">6</span></span>Whitherward
yearning speed the two young Damsels, accordant,  
  Day and Night, of different colour?  
  Who out of many, tell me, is that Skambha to whom the Waters  
   take their way with longing?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000707">7</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha,  
  On whom Prajāpati set up and firmly stablished all the worlds?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000708">8</span></span>That
universe which Prajāpati created, wearing all forms,, the  
   highest, midmost, lowest,  
  How far did Skambha penetrate within it? What portion did  
   he leave unpenetrated?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000709">9</span></span>How far
within the past hath Skambha entered? How much of  
   him hath reached into the future?  
  That one part which he set in thousand places,—how far did  
  Skambha penetrate within it?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000710">10</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha in whom men  
   recognize the Waters, Brahma,  
  In whom they know the worlds and their enclosures, in whom  
   are non-existence and existence?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000711">11</span></span>Declare
that. Skambha, who is he of many,  
  In whom, exerting every power, Fervour maintains her loftiest  
   vow; <span id="page_22">p. 22</span>  
  In whom are comprehended Law, Waters, Devotion and Belief  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000712">12</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha  
  On whom as their foundation earth and firmament and sky are  
   set;  
  In whom as their appointed place rest Fire and Moon and Sun  
   and Wind?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000713">13</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha  
  He in whose body are contained all three-and-thirty Deities?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000714">14</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha.  
  In whom the Sages earliest born, the Richas, Sāman, Yajus,  
  Earth, and the one highest Sage abide?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000715">15</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is the Skambha.  
  Who comprehendeth, for mankind, both immortality and death,  
  He who containeth for mankind the gathered waters as his  
   veins?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000716">16</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha,  
  He whose chief arteries stand there, the sky's four regions, he irk  
   whom Sacrifice putteth forth its might?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000717">17</span></span>They who in
Purusha understand Brahma know Him who is.  
  Supreme.  
  He who knows Him who is Supreme, and he who knows the  
  Lord of Life,  
  These know the loftiest Power Divine, and thence know Skam-  
   bha thoroughly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000718">18</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha  
  Of whom Vaisvānara became the head, the Angirases his eye,  
   and Yātus his corporeal parts?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000719">19</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha  
  Whose mouth they say is Holy Lore, his tongue the Honey-  
   sweetened Whip, his udder is Virāj, they say?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000720">20</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha  
  From whom they hewed the lichas off, from whom they  
   chipped the Yajus, he  
  Whose hairs are Sāma-verses and his mouth the Atharvāngi-  
   rases?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000721">21</span></span>Men count
as 'twere a thing supreme nonentity's conspicuous  
   branch;  
  And lower man who serve thy branch regard it as an entity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000722">22</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha <span id="page_23">p. 23</span>  
  In whom Ādityas dwell, in whom Rudras and Vasus are  
   contained,  
  In whom the future and the past and all the worlds are firmly  
   set;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000723">23</span></span>Whose
secret treasure evermore the three-and thirty Gods  
   protect?  
  Who knoweth now the treasure which, O Deities ye watch and  
   guard?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000724">24</span></span>Where the
Gods, versed in Sacred Lore, worship the loftiest  
  Power Divine  
  The priest who knows them face to face may be a sage who  
   knows the truth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000725">25</span></span>Great,
verily, are those Gods who sprang from non-existence  
   into life.  
  Further, men say that that one part of Skambha is nonentity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000726">26</span></span>Where
Skambha generating gave the Ancient World its shape  
   and form,  
  They recognized that single part of Skambha as the Ancient  
  World,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000727">27</span></span>The
three-and-thirty Gods within his body were disposed as  
   limbs:  
  Some, deeply versed in Holy Lore, some know those three-and-  
   thirty Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000728">28</span></span>Men know
Hiranyagarbha as supreme and inexpressible:  
  In the beginning, in the midst of the world, Skambha poured  
   that gold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000729">29</span></span>On Skambha
Fervour rests, the worlds and Holy Law repose on  
   him.  
  Skambha, I clearly know that all of thee on Indra is imposed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000730">30</span></span>On Indra
Fervour rests, on him the worlds and Holy Law  
   recline.  
  Indra, I clearly know that all of thee on Skambha findeth rest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000731">31</span></span>Ere sun and
dawn man calls and calls one Deity by the other's  
   name.  
  When the Unborn first sprang into existence he reached that  
   independent sovran lordship; than which aught higher never  
   hath arisen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000732">32</span></span>Be
reverence paid to him, that highest Brahma, whose base is  
  Earth, his belly Air, who made the sky to be his head. <span
id="page_24">p. 24</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000733">33</span></span>Homage to
highest Brahma, him whose eye is Sūrya and the  
  Moon who groweth young and new again, him who made  
  Agni for his mouth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000734">34</span></span>Homage to
highest Brahma, him whose two life-breathings were  
   the Wind,  
  The Angirases his sight: who made the regions be his means of  
   sense.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000735">35</span></span>Skambha set
fast these two, the earth and heaven, Skambha  
   maintained the ample air between them.  
  Skambha established the six spacious regions: this whole world  
  Skambha entered and pervaded.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000736">36</span></span>Homage to
highest Brahma, him who, sprung from Fervour and  
   from toil,  
  Filled all the worlds completely, who made Soma for himself  
   alone.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000737">37</span></span>Why doth
the Wind move ceaselessly? Why doth the spirit take  
   no rest?  
  Why do the Waters, seeking truth, never at any time repose?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000738">38</span></span>Absorbed in
Fervour, is the mighty Being, in the world's centre,  
   on the waters' surface.  
  To him the Deities, one and all betake them. So stand the tree-  
   trunk with the branches round it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000739">39</span></span>Who out of
many, tell me, is that Skambha.  
  To whom the Deities with hands, with feet, and voice, and ear,  
   and eye.  
  Present unmeasured tribute in the measured hall of sacrifice?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000740">40</span></span>Darkness is
chased away from him: he is exempt from all dist-  
   ress.  
  In him are all the lights, the three abiding in Prajāpati.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000741">41</span></span>He verily
who knows the Reed of Gold that stands amid the  
   flood, is the mysterious Lord of Life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000742">42</span></span>Singly the
two young Maids of different colours approach the  
   six-pegged warp in turns and weave it.  
  The one draws out the threads, the other lays them: they break  
   them not, they reach no end of labour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000743">43</span></span>Of these
two, dancing round as 'twere, I cannot distinguish  
   whether ranks before the other.  
  A Male in weaves this web, a Male divides it: a Male hath  
   stretched it to the cope of heaven <span id="page_25">p. 25</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000744">44</span></span>These pegs
have buttressed up the sky. The Sāmans have turned  
   them into shuttles for the weaving.
