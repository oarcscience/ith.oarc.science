### HYMN XXIX

#### A charm for the destruction of malignant goblins

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502901">1</span></span>Made ready
in the east drive forth, take notice of what is hap-  
   pening here, omniscient Agni! <span id="page_a193">p. a193</span>  
  Thou bringest medicine and healest sickness: through thee may  
   we win horses, kine, and people.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502902">2</span></span>Accordant
with all Gods, O Jātavedas Agni, perform this work  
   as we beseech thee,  
  That this defence of his may fall, whoever hath caused us pain,  
   whoever hath consumed us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502903">3</span></span>Unanimous,
with all the Gods together, so do this thing O Agni  
  Jātavedas, that this defence of his may fall and fail him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502904">4</span></span>Pierce both
his eyes, pierce thou the heart within him, crush  
   thou his teeth and cleave his tongue asunder.  
  Rend thou, most youthful Agni, that Pisācha whoso amid them  
   all of this hath eaten.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502905">5</span></span>Whatever of
his body hath been taken, plundered, borne off, or  
   eaten by Pisāchas,  
  This, Agni, knowing it, again bring hither! We give back flesh  
   and spirit to his body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502906">6</span></span>If some
Pisācha in my food raw, ready, thoroughly cooked, or,  
   spotty, hath deceived me,  
  Let the Pisāchas with their lives and offspring atone for this,  
   and let this man be healthy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502907">7</span></span>If one hath
cheated me in milk or porridge, in food from grain  
   or plants that need no culture.  
  Let the Pisāchas, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502908">8</span></span>If one,
flesh eater, in a draught of water have wronged me lying  
   in the bed of goblins,  
  Let the Pisāchas, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502909">9</span></span>If one,
flesh-eater, in the day or night-time have wronged me  
   lying in the bed of goblins,  
  Let the Pisāchas, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502910">10</span></span>O Agni
Jātavedas, slay the bloody Pisācha, flesh-devourer, mind-  
   destroyer,  
  Strong Indra strike him with his bolt of thunder, courageous  
  Soma cut his head to pieces!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502911">11</span></span>Thou, Agni,
ever slayest Yātudhānas, the fiends have never con-  
   quered thee in battles.  
  Consume thou from the root the flesh-devourers, let none of  
   them escape thy heavenly weapon  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502912">12</span></span>Collect, O
Jātavedas, what hath been removed and borne away.  
  Let this man's members grow, let him swell like the tendril of a  
   plant. <span id="page_a194">p. a194</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502913">13</span></span>Like as the
Soma's tendril, thus, O Jātavedas let him swell,  
  Let him live, Agni I Make him fat, free from consumption, full  
   of sap.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502914">14</span></span>Here, Agni,
is the fuel, here are logs that crush Pisāchas down.  
  O Jātavedas, willingly accept them and be pleased therewith.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502915">15</span></span>Accept, O
Agni, with thy flame the billets of Tārshtāgha wood.  
  Let the flesh-eater who would take the flesh of this man lose his  
   form.
