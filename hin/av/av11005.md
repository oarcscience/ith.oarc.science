### HYMN V

#### A glorification of the Brahmachgri or religious student

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100501">1</span></span>Stirring
both worlds the Brahmachāri moveth: in him the  
   deities are all one-minded.  
  He hath established firmly earth and heaven: he satisfies his  
  Master with his Fervour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100502">2</span></span>After the
Brahmachārī go the Fathers, the heavenly hosts, all  
  Gods in separate order.  
  After him too have the Gandharvas followed, thirty and three,  
   three hundred, and six thousand. He satisfies all Gods with  
   his devotion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100503">3</span></span>The Master,
welcoming his new disciple, into his bowels takes  
   the Brahmachāri.  
  Three nights he holds and bears him in this belly. When he is  
   born, the Gods convene to see him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100504">4</span></span>This log is
earth, the second log is heaven: he fills the air's mid  
   region with the fuel.  
  With fuel, with his zone the Brahmachāri contents the worlds,  
   with labour and with Fervour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100505">5</span></span>The
Brahmachāri, earlier born than Brahma, sprang up through  
  Fervour, robed in hot libation.  
  From him sprang heavenly lore, the highest Brahma, and all the  
  Gods, with life that lasts for ever. <span id="page_56">p. 56</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100506">6</span></span>Lighted by
fuel goes the Brahmachāri, clad in black-buck skin,  
   consecrate, long-bearded.  
  Swiftly he goes from east to northern ocean, grasping the worlds,  
   oft bringing them anear him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100507">7</span></span>The
Brahmachāri, fathering Prayer, world, Waters, Virāj, Prajā-  
   pati, and Parameshthin,  
  Lay as a germ within the Immortal's bosom, then became Indra  
   and destroyed the demons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100508">8</span></span>The Master
fashioned both these cloudy regions, profound and  
   spacious pair, the earth and heaven.  
  The Brahmachāri guards them with his Fervour. In him the  
   deities are all one-minded.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100509">9</span></span>The
Brahmachāri first of all brought hither this ample earth as  
   alms, and heaven above it.  
  He makes these twain two fuel-logs, and worships, On these sup-  
   ported rest all living creatures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100510">10</span></span>Both
treasuries of sacred lore lie hidden, one hitherward, beyond  
   heaven's ridge the other.  
  The Brahmachārī with his Fervour guards them. He makes this  
   all his own as knowing Brahma.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100511">11</span></span>Hitherward
one, hence from the earth the other, two Agnis meet  
   between these cloudy regions.  
  Close to these two firm rays of light are clinging. The Brahma-  
   chāri enters them through Fervour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100512">12</span></span>Thundering,
shouting, ruddy-hued, and pallid, he bears along the  
   earth great manly vigour.  
  Down on the ridge of earth the Brahmachāri pours seed, and  
   this gives life to heaven's four regions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100513">13</span></span>The
Brahmachāri stores with fuel Waters, and Fire, and Sun, and  
  Moon, and Mātarisvan.  
  The Water's lights move separate in the rain-cloud, Man, rain,  
   and water are their molten butter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100514">14</span></span>The Master
is Death, Varuna, Soma, the plants of earth, and  
   milk.  
  The thunder-clouds were men of war. By these this heavenly  
   light was brought.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100515">15</span></span>Varuna,
made a Master, takes at home the butter to himself.  
  Whatever with Prajāpati he sought, the Brahmachāri gave like  
  Mitra from his loftiest soul. <span id="page_57">p. 57</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100516">16</span></span>The pupil
is the Master, yea, the pupil is Prajāpati.  
  Prajāpati shines bright; the bright Virāj grew potent Indra's self.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100517">17</span></span>By Fervour
and by self-restraint the King protects the realm he  
   rules.  
  By self-restraint the Master seeks a Brahmachari to instruct.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100518">18</span></span>By
self-restraint a maiden finds a youth to be her wedded lord.  
  By self-restraint the ox and horse seek to win fodder for them-  
   selves.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100519">19</span></span>By Fervour
and by self-restraint the Gods draye Death away  
   from them,  
  And Indra brought by self-restraint heaven's lustre to the deities.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100520">20</span></span>The plants,
what is and what shall be, day, night, the tall tree of  
   the wood,  
  The year with seasons of the year, all from the Brahmachāri  
   sprang.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100521">21</span></span>All
creatures of the earth and heaven, tame animals and sylvan  
   beasts,  
  Winged and wingless creatures, from the Brahmachāri sprang  
   to life,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100522">22</span></span>All
children of Prajāpati have breath distinctly in themselves.  
  The Brahma that is stored within the Brahmachāri guards them  
   all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100523">23</span></span>Piled up on
high, but never yet ascended, that power of deities  
   is brightly shining.  
  From that sprang heavenly lore, the loftiest Brahma, and all the  
  Gods with, life that lasts for ever.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100524">24</span></span>The
Brahmachāri wields the radiant Brahma wherein all Gods  
   are woven close together;  
  Creating breath, inhaling and exhaling, voice, mind, and heart,  
  Brahma and holy wisdom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100525">25</span></span>Bestow on
us the power of sight and hearing, glory and food and  
   seed and blood and belly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100526">26</span></span>These,
standing on the flood, the Brahmachāri formed practising  
   in sea his hot devotion.  
  When he hath bathed, brown, yellow-hued, he shines exceedingly  
   on earth.
