### HYMN XXX

#### A charm to promote the growth of hair

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0603001">1</span></span>Over a magic
stone, beside Sarasvati, the Gods Ploughed in this  
   barley that was blent with mead.  
  Lord of the plough was Indra, strong with hundred powers: the  
   ploughers were the Maruts they who give rich gifts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0603002">2</span></span>Thy joy in
hair that falleth or is scattered, wherewith thou sub-  
   jectest a man to laughter  
  To other trees, far from thee will I drive it. Grow up, thou  
  Samī, with a hundred branches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0603003">3</span></span>Auspicious,
bearing mighty leaves, holy one, nurtured by the rain,  
  Even as a mother to her sons, be gracious, Samī to our hair.
