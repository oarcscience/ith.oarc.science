### HYMN XXXIV

#### Glorification of the Vishtāri sacrifice

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403401">1</span></span>The head of
this is prayer, its back the Brihat, Odanas's belly is  
   the Vāmadevya;  
  Its face reality, its sides the metre, Vishtāri sacrifice produced  
   from fervour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403402">2</span></span>Boneless,
cleansed, purified by him who cleanseth, they go res-  
   plendent to the world of splendour.  
  Fire burneth not their organ of enjoyment: much pleasure have  
   they in the world of Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403403">3</span></span>Never doth
want or evil fortune visit those who prepare oblation  
   called Vishtāri.  
  He goes unto the Gods, he dwells with Yama, he joys among  
  Gandharvas meet for Soma.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403404">4</span></span>Yama robs
not of generative vigour the men who dress oblation  
   called Vishtāri.  
  Borne on his car, a charioteer, he travels: endowed with wings  
   he soars beyond the heavens.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403405">5</span></span>Strongest is
this, performed, of sacrifices: he hath reached  
   heaven who hath prepared Vishtāri.  
  The oval-fruited lotus spreads his fibre: there bloom the nelo-  
   phar and water-lilies.  
  Abundant with their overflow of sweetness, these streams shall  
   reach thee in the world of Svarga, whole lakes with lotus-  
   blossom shall approach thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403406">6</span></span>Full lakes
of butter with their banks of honey, flowing with wine,  
   and milk and curds and water  
  Abundant with their overflow of sweetness, these streams shall  
   reach thee in the world of Svarga, whole lakes with lotus-  
   blossom shall approach thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403407">7</span></span>I give four
pitchers, in four several places, filled to the brim with  
   milk and curds and water. <span id="page_a144">p. a144</span>  
  Abundant with their overflow of sweetness, these streams shall  
   reach thee in the world of Svarga, whole lakes with lotus-  
   blossom shall approach thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403408">8</span></span>I part this
Odana among the Brāhmans, Vishtāri, conquering  
   worlds and reaching heaven.  
  Let me not lose it: swelling by its nature, be it my perfect Cow  
   to grant all wishes!
