### HYMN XXVI

#### A hymn accompanying investiture with an amulet of gold

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902601">1</span></span>Gold that
was born from Fire is immortal hath been deposited  
   with mortal creatures.  
  He who knows this deserves to own this jewel, and in extreme  
   old age dies he who wears it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902602">2</span></span>The men of
ancient time with children round them longed for  
   this Gold, bright with the Sun's own colour,  
  This shall endow thee, as it shines, with splendour, and long  
   shall be the life of him who wears it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902603">3</span></span>Long life
and splendour let it bring energy and strength to thee.  
  That thou mayst shine among the folk with all the brightness of  
   the Gold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902604">4</span></span>What Varuna
the King knows well, and what the God  
  Brihaspati,  
  And Indra, Slayer of the Foe, may that bestow long life on thee,  
   may that increase thy splendid strength.
