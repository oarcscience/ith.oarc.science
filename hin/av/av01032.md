### HYMN XXXII

#### In praise of Heaven and Earth

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103201">1</span></span>Ye people,
hear and mark this well: he will pronounce a mighty  
   prayer:  
  That which gives breathing to the Plants is not on earth nor in,  
   the heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103202">2</span></span>Their
station, as of those who rest when weary, is in midmost air:  
  The base whereon this world is built, the sages know or know  
   it not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103203">3</span></span>What the two
trembling hemispheres and ground produced and  
   fashioned forth.  
  This All, is ever fresh to-day, even as the currents of the sea.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103204">4</span></span>This All
hath compassed round the one, and on the other lies  
   at rest.  
  To Earth and all-possessing Heaven mine adoration have I paid.
