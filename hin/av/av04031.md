### HYMN XXXI

#### A hymn to Manyu or Wrath

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403101">1</span></span>Borne on
with thee, O Manyu girt by Maruts, let our brave men,  
   impetuous, bursting forward,  
  March on, like flames of fire in form, exulting, with pointed  
   arrows, sharpening their weapons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403102">2</span></span>Flashing
like fire, be thou, O conquering Manyu, invoked, O  
   victor, as our army's leader.  
  Slay thou our foes, distribute their possession: show forth thy  
   vigour, scatter those who hate us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403103">3</span></span>O Manyu,
overcome those who assail us. On! breaking, slaying,  
   crushing down the foemen.  
  They have not hindered thine impetuous vigour: mighty! sole  
   born! reduce them to subjection.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403104">4</span></span>Alone of
many thou art worshipped, Manyu: sharpen the spirit  
   of each clan for combat.  
  With thee to aid, O thou of perfect splendour, we raise the  
   glorious battle-shout for conquest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403105">5</span></span>Unyielding,
bringing victory like Indra, O Manyu be thou here  
   our sovran ruler. <span id="page_a141">p. a141</span>  
  To thy dear name. O victor, we sing praises: we know the  
   spring from which thou art come hither.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403106">6</span></span>Twin-borne
with power, destructive bolt of thunder the highest  
   conquering might is thine, subduer!  
  Be friendly to us in thy spirit, Manyu! O much-invoked, in  
   shock of mighty battle!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403107">7</span></span>For spoil
let Varuna and Manyu give us the wealth of both sides  
   gathered and collected;  
  And let our enemies with stricken spirits, o'er-whelmed with.  
   terror, sling away defeated.
