### HYMN V

#### Invitation to, and praise of Indra

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200501">1</span></span>Indra, be
gracious, drive thou forth, come, Hero, with thy two  
   bay steeds.  
  Taste the libation, hither, enjoying meath and the hymn, come,  
   fair, to the banquet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200502">2</span></span>O Indra,
even as one athirst, fill thee with meath as 'twere from  
   heaven.  
  Sweet-toned, the raptures of this juice have come to thee as to  
   the light.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0200503">3</span></span>Swift-conquering Indra, Mitra like,
smote, as a Yati, Vritra  
   dead.  
  Like Bhrigu he cleft Vala through, and quelled his foes in Soma's  
   rapturous joy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200504">4</span></span>O Indra, let
the juices enter thee. Fill full thy belly, sate thee,  
   mighty one! Let the hymn bring thee.  
  Hear thou my call, accept the song I sing, here, Indra, with thy  
   friends enjoy thyself, to height of rapture.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200505">5</span></span>Now will I
tell the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he  
   achieved, the thunder-wielder.  
  He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft the  
   channels of the mountain torrents.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200506">6</span></span>He slew the
Dragon lying on the mountain: his heavenly bolt of  
   thunder Tvashtar fashioned.  
  Like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided  
   downward to the ocean.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200507">7</span></span>Impetuous as
a bull he chose the Soma, and quaffed the juices  
   in three sacred beakers. <span id="page_a38">p. a38</span>  
  Maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon, and smote to  
   death this first-born of the dragons.
