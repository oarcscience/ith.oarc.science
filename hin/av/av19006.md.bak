### HYMN VI

#### The purusha-Sūkta, on the mystical Sacrifice of Purusha

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900601">1</span></span>Purusha hath
a thousand arms, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet.  
  On every side pervading earth he fills a space ten fingers wide.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900602">2</span></span>He with
three quarters rose to heaven here reappeared a fourth  
   of him.  
  Thence he strode forth on every side to all that eats not and that  
   eats.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900603">3</span></span>So mighty is
his grandeur, yea, greater than this is Purusha.  
  All creatures are one-fourth of him, three-fourths what dieth  
   not in heaven. <span id="page_214">p. 214</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900604">4</span></span>Purusha is
in truth this All, what hath been and what yet shall;  
   be  
  Lord, too, of immortality—and what hath grown with some-  
   what else.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900605">5</span></span>When they
divided Purusha how many portions did they make?  
  What was his mouth? what were his arms? what are the names  
   of thighs and feet?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900606">6</span></span>The Brāhman
was his mouth, of both his arms was the Rājanya  
   made.  
  His waist became the Vaisya, from his feet the Sūdra was  
   produced.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900607">7</span></span>The Moon was
gendered from his mind, and from his eye the  
  Sun had birth.  
  Indra and Agni from his mouth were born and Vāyu from his  
   breath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900608">8</span></span>Forth from
his navel come mid-air; the sky was fashioned from  
   his head.  
  Earth from his feet, and from his ear the regions. Thus they  
   formed the worlds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900609">9</span></span>In the
beginning rose Virāj: Purusha from Virāj was born.  
  As soon as he was born he spread westward and eastward o'er  
   the earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900610">10</span></span>When Gods
performed the sacrifice with Purusha as their  
   offering.  
  Spring was the butter, summer was the fuel, autumn was the  
   gift.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900611">11</span></span>That
sacrifice, first-born Purusha, they hallowed with the sprink-  
   led Rains.  
  The Deities, the Sādhyas, all the Vasus sacrificed with him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900612">12</span></span>From it
were horses born, from it all creatures with two rows of  
   teeth.  
  From it were generated kine, from it were goats and sheep  
   produced.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900613">13</span></span>From that
great general sacrifice Richas and Sāma hymns were  
   born;  
  Therefrom the metres were produced: the Yajus had its birth  
   from it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900614">14</span></span>From that
great general sacrifice the dripping fat was gathered up:  
  It formed the creatures fleet as wind, and animals both wild and  
   tame. <span id="page_215">p. 215</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900615">15</span></span>Seven
fencing-logs had he, thrice seven layers of fuel were  
   prepared.  
  When, offering sacrifice, the Gods bound as their victim Purusha.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900616">16</span></span>Forth from
head of the high God seven-and-seventy bright  
   beams.  
  Sprang into being, of the King Soma produced from Purusha.
