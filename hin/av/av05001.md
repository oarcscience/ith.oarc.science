### HYMN I

#### A glorification of Trita and Varuna

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500101">1</span></span>He who with
special plans and deathless spirit, waxing, well-  
   born, hath come unto his birth-place,  
  As he who shines upholds the days, thus Trita, of pure life,  
   bears the Three as their supporter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500102">2</span></span>He who, the
first, approached the holy statutes makes, after,  
   many beauteous forms and figures.  
  Eager to drink, his birth-place first he entered who understands  
   the word when yet unspoken.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500103">3</span></span>He who—the
fluid gold, with radiant kinsmen—to fervent glow  
   delivered up thy body,  
  On him both set names, that shall live for ever: to him the regions  
   shall send robes to clothe him,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500104">4</span></span>As these
have gone to their primeval station, each gaining an  
   imperishable dwelling,  
  May kissing mothers of the bards' beloved bring the pole-draw-  
   ing husband to the sister.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500105">5</span></span>By holy
wisdom I a sage, Far-Strider! offer to thee this lofty  
   adoration.  
  This worship both the mighty eddying rivers, coming together  
   to this station, heighten.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500106">6</span></span>Seven are
the pathways which the wise have fashioned: to one  
   of these may come the troubled mortal.  
  On sure ground where the ways are parted standeth Life's Pillar  
   in the dwelling of the Highest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500107">7</span></span>Working, I
go my way with deathless spirit: life, spirit, bodies  
   have gone gladly thither.  
  Aye, Sakra also gives his gift of treasure as when the sacrificer  
   meets with power.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500108">8</span></span>Yea, the son
asks dominion of his father: this they declared the  
   noblest path to welfare.  
  Varuna, let them see thy revelations: display the wondrous  
   shapes of times to follow. <span id="page_a154">p. a154</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500109">9</span></span>Halt with
the milk, its other half, thou minglest and with that  
   half, strong! unbeguiled! increasest.  
  Let us exalt the gracious friend, the mighty, Varuna son of-  
  Aditi, strength-giver.  
  We have told him the marvels sung by poets. The utterance of  
  Heaven and Earth is truthful.
