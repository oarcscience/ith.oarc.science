### HYMN CXXVIII

#### Sacrificial formulas

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012801">1</span></span>The
worshipper who pours the juice, for gathering and assembly  
   fit,  
  And yonder foe-destroying Sun,—these have the Gods designed  
   of old.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012802">2</span></span>He who
defiles a sister, he who willingly would harm a friend,  
  The fool who slights his elder, these, they say, must suffer down.  
   below.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012803">3</span></span>Whenever any
good man's son becometh bold and spirited,  
  Then hath the wise Gandharva said this pleasant upward-point-  
   ing word.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012804">4</span></span>The most
unprofitable churl, the wealthy men who brings no.  
   gift,  
  These, verily, as we have heard, are cast away by all the wise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012805">5</span></span>But they who
have adored the Gods, and they who have best-  
   owed their gifts,  
  Those liberal lords are filled with wealth like Sūrya risen up to  
   heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012806">6</span></span>With
unanointed eyes and limbs, wearing no gem or ring of  
   gold.  
  No priest, no Brāhman's son is he: these things are ordered in  
   the rules.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012807">7</span></span>With
well-anointed limbs and eyes, wearing fair gem and golden,  
   ring,  
  Good priest is he, the Brāhman's son; these things are ordered  
   in the rules.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012808">8</span></span>Pools with
no place for drinking, and the wealthy man who.  
   giveth naught,  
  The pretty girl you may not touch, these things are ordered in:  
   the rules. <span id="page_366">p. 366</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012809">9</span></span>Pools with
good drinking places, and the wealthy man who  
   freely gives,  
  The pretty girl who may be touched, these things are ordered in  
   the rules.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012810">10</span></span>The
favourite wife neglected, and the man who safely shuns the  
   fight,  
  A sluggish horse whom none may guide, these things are order-  
   ed in the rules.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012811">11</span></span>The
favourite wife most dearly loved, the man who safely goes  
   to war,  
  The fleet steed who obeys the rein, these things are ordered in  
   the rules.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012812">12</span></span>When,
Indra, thou, as no man could, didst plunge into the Ten  
  Kings' fight,  
  That was a guard for every man: for he is formed to stay  
   disease.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012813">13</span></span>Easily
conquering Maghavan, thou, Hero, bentest Raji down,  
  Rentest asunder Rauhina, calvest in pieces Vritra's head.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012814">14</span></span>Thou who
didst separate the clouds and penetrate the water-  
   floods,  
  To thee, great slayer of the foe, be glory, Indra, yea, to thee!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012815">15</span></span>They said
to Auchchaihsravasa running as side-horse of the  
  Bays,  
  Safely to victory, O Steed, bear Indra with the beauteous wreath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012816">16</span></span>They yoke
the white mares, on the Bay's right harness Auchchai-  
   hsravasa.  
  He joyeth as he carrieth Indra the foremost of the Gods.
