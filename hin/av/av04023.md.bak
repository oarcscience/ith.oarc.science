### HYMN XXIII

#### Magnification of Agni and prayer for his protection

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402301">1</span></span>I fix my
heart on wise and ancient Agni, the Five Tribes' Lord,  
   in many a place enkindled.  
  We seek him who hath entered all our houses. May he deliver  
   us from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402302">2</span></span>As thou
conveyest offerings, Jātavedas! and fashionest the sacri-  
   fice with knowledge,  
  So bear thou to the Gods the prayer we utter. May he deliver  
   us from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402303">3</span></span>I pray to
Agni in each act successful, employed in every sacrifice,  
   the strongest,  
  Fiend-slayer, served with fatness, strengthening worship. May  
   he deliver us from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402304">4</span></span>We invoke
the oblation-bearer, well-born Agni Jātavedas,  
  Him, Vaisvānara, almighty. May he set us free from trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402305">5</span></span>With whom as
friend the Rishis gave their power new splendour,  
   with whom they kept aloof the Asuras' devices,  
  Agni, with whom Indra subdued the Panis. May he deliver us.  
   from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402306">6</span></span>Through whom
the Gods discovered life eternal, through whom  
   they stored the plants with pleasant juices,  
  Through whom they brought to men the light of heaven. May  
   he deliver us from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402307">7</span></span>I,
suppliant, praise and ever call on Agni, sole Lord of all this  
   world, of all that shineth,  
  Of what exists and shall exist hereafter. May he deliver us from  
   grief and trouble.
