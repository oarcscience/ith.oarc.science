### HYMN III

#### A glorification of the Odana or oblation of boiled rice

   <span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100301">1</span></span>1. Of
that Odana Brihaspati is the head, Brahma the mouth.  
   <span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100302">2</span></span>2. Heaven
and Earth are the ears, the Sun and Moon are the  
   eyes, the seven Rishis are the vital airs inhaled and exhaled. <span
id="page_50">p. 50</span>  
   3. Vision is the pestle, Desire the mortar. 4. Diti is the  
   winnowing basket, Aditi is she who holds it, Vāta is the sifter.  
   5. Horses are the grains, oxen the winnowed ricegrains, gnats  
   the husks. 6. Kabru is the husked grain, the rain cloud is the  
   reed. 7. Grey iron is its flesh, copper its blood. 8. Tin is its  
   ashes, gold its colour, the blue lotus flower its scent. 9. The  
   threshing-floor is its dish, the wooden swords its shoulders,  
   the car-shafts its backbones. 10. Collar-bones are its entrails,  
   straps its intestines. 11. This earth, verily becomes the jar,  
   and heaven the cover of the Odana as it is cooking.  
   12. Furrows are its ribs, sandy soils the undigested contents  
   of its stomach. 13. Law is its water for the hands and family  
   custom its aspersion. 14. The jar covered with the Rich has  
   been solemnly directed by the priestly office. 15. Received by  
   the Brāhman, it has been carried round. 16. The Brihat is,  
   the stirring-spoon, the Rathantara the ladle. 17. The Seasons  
   are the dressers, the Groups of Seasons kindle the fire.  
   18. The caldron flames round the oblation (*charu*) whose  
   mouth consists of five openings.  
   <span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100319">19</span></span>19. The
sacrificial word, all worlds are to be won with Odana.  
   <span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100320">20</span></span>20.
Whereon in order rest the three, the ocean, and the heaven, and  
   earth.  
   <span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100321">21</span></span>21.
Within the residue whereof the Gods arranged six eightieth  
   parts—  
   <span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100322">22</span></span>22. I
ask thee, of this Odana what is the mighty magnitude.  
   <span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100323">23</span></span>23. He
who may know the magnitude of the Odana. 24. Would say,  
  Not small, nor devoid of moistening sauce; not this, nor any-  
   thing whatever. 25. He would not declare it to be greater than  
   the giver imagines it to be. 26. The theologians say, Thou  
   hast eaten the averted Odana and the Odana turned hither-  
   ward. 27. Thou hast eaten the Odana and the Odana will eat  
   thee. 28. Thou hast eaten this averted; thy inward breath will  
   leave thee; so he said to this one. 29. Thou hast eaten this  
   turned hitherward; thy downward breath will leave thee; so  
   he said to this one. 30. I indeed have not eaten the Odana,  
   nor has the Odana eaten me. 31. The Odana has just eaten  
   the Odana.

thence he said to this one, Thou hast eaten this with a<span
id="page_51">p. 51</span>  
   different head from that with which the ancient Rishis ate:  
   thy offspring, reckoning from the eldest, will die. I have eaten  
   it neither turned downward, nor turned away, nor turned  
   hitherward. With Brihaspati as head: with him I have eaten,  
   with him have I come to it. Now this Odana is complete with  
   all members, joints, and body. Complete, verily, with all his  
   members, joints, and body is he who possess this knowledge.  
   33. And thence he said to him, Thou hast eaten this with  
   other ears than those with which the ancient Rishis ate it.  
   Thou wilt be deaf. I have eaten it neither, etc. (as in verse 32).  
   With Heaven and Earth as ears, with these I have eaten it,  
   with these I have come to it. Now this Odana, etc. (as in 32).  
   34. And thence he said to him. Thou hast eaten this with  
   other eyes . . . thou wilt be blind. With Sun and Moon, etc.  
   35. And thence, etc. . . with other month. Thy offspring will  
   die, reckoning from the head . . . With Brahma as mouth.  
   36. And thence, etc. . . . with other tongue . . . Thy tongue  
   will die . . . With the tongue of Agni. 37. And thence, etc. . .  
   With other teeth . . . Thy teeth will fall out . . . With the  
   Seasons as teeth. 38. And thence, etc. . . . with other vital  
   airs. . . . Thy vital airs will leave thee . . . With the Seven  
   Rishis as the vital airs. 39. And thence, etc. . . . with other  
   expanse . . . Consumption will destroy thee . . . With the  
   firmament as expanse. 40 And thence, etc. . . . with other  
   back. . . . Lightning will slay thee. . . With the heaven as  
   back. 41. And thence, etc. . . . with other breast . . . Thou  
   wilt fail in agriculture. . . . With the earth as breast. 42. And  
   thence, etc. . . . with other belly . . . colic will destroy thee . .
.  
   With truth as belly. 43. And thence, etc. . . . with other  
   abdomen . . . Thou wilt die in the water . . . With the sea as  
   abdomen. 44. And thence, etc. . . . with other thighs . . .  
   Thy thigh will perish . . . With Mitra-Varuna as thighs.  
   45. And thence, etc. . . . with other knees . . . Thou wilt  
   become a sick man . . . With the knees of Tvashtar. 46. And  
   thence, etc. . . . with other feet . . . Thou wilt become a  
   wanderer . . . With the feet of the Asvins. 47. And thence,  
   etc. . . with other fore-parts of the feet . . . A serpent will  
   kill thee . . . With the fore-parts of Savitar's feet. 48. And  
   thence, etc. . . . with other hands . . . The Brāhmana (divine  
   power) will kill thee . . . With the hands of Right. 49. And <span
id="page_52">p. 52</span>  
   thence, etc. . . . with other basis . . . Without standing-ground  
   and resting-place thou wilt die . . . Having taken my stand on  
   truth. With this I ate it, with this I came to it. Now this  
   Odana is complete with all members, joints, and body.  
   Complete, verily, with all his members, joints, and body is he  
   who possesses this knowledge.
