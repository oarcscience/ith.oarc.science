### HYMN II

#### The glorification of the Sun as Āditya, Sūrya and Rohita

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300201">1</span></span>Radiant,
refulgent in the sky are reared the banners of his light,  
  Āditya's, who beholdeth man, mighty in act and bountiful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300202">2</span></span>Let us laud
him, the whole world's Herdsman, Sūrya, who with  
   his rays illumines all the regions,  
  Mark of the quarters, brightening them with lustre, swift,  
   mighty-pinioned, flying in the ocean.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300203">3</span></span>From west to
east thou speedest freely, making by magic day  
   and night of diverse colours.  
  This is Āditya, thy transcendent glory, that thou alone art born  
   through all creation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300204">4</span></span>Victorious,
inspired, and brightly shining, whom seven strong  
   tawny-coloured coursers carry,  
  Whom Atri lifted from the flood to heaven, thus men behold  
   thee as thy course thou runnest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300205">5</span></span>Let them not
snare thee speeding on thy journey: pass safely,  
   swiftly places hard to traverse,  
  While measuring out the day and night thou movest—O Sūrya,  
   even Heaven and Earth the Goddess.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300206">6</span></span>Hail to thy
rapid car whereon, O Sūrya, thou circlest in a  
   moment both the limits,  
  Whirled by thy bay steeds, best of all at drawing, thy hundred  
   horses or seven goodly coursers!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300207">7</span></span>Mount thy
strong car, O Sūrya, lightly rolling, drawn by good  
   steeds, propitious, brightly gleaming,  
  Whirled by thy bays, most excellent at drawing, thy hundred  
   horses or seven goodly coursers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300208">8</span></span>Sūrya hath
harnessed to his car to draw him seven stately bay  
   steeds gay with wolden housings.  
  The Bright One started from the distant region: dispelling  
   gloom the God hath climbed the heavens.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300209">9</span></span>With lofty
banner hath the God gone upward, and introduced  
   the light, expelling darkness.  
  He hath looked round on all the worlds, the Hero, the son of  
  Aditi, Celestial Eagle. <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300210">10</span></span>Rising,
thou spreadest out thy rays, thou nourishest all shapes  
   and forms.  
  Thou with thy power illumest both the oceans, encompassing  
   all spheres with thy refulgence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300211">11</span></span>Moving by
magic power to east and westward, these two young  
   creatures, sporting, circle ocean.  
  One of the pair beholds all living creatures: with wheels of gold  
   the bay steeds bear the other.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300212">12</span></span>Atri
established thee in heaven. O Surya, to create the month.  
  So on thou goest, firmly held, heating, beholding all that is.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300213">13</span></span>As the Calf
both his parents so thou joinest both the distant  
   bounds,  
  Surely the Gods up yonder knew this sacred mystery long ago.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300214">14</span></span>Sūrya is
eager to obtain all wealth that lies along the sea,  
  Great is the course spread out for him, his eastward and his  
   westward path.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300215">15</span></span>He finishes
his race with speed and never turns his thought  
   aside,  
  Thereby he keeps not from the Gods enjoyment of the Drink of  
   Life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300216">16</span></span>His heralds
bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all that  
   live,  
  Sūrya, that all may look on him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300217">17</span></span>The
Constellations pass away, like thieves, departing in the  
   night.  
  Before the all-beholding Sun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300218">18</span></span>His herald
rays are seen afar refulgent o'er the world of men,  
  Like flames of fire that burn and blaze.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300219">19</span></span>Swift and
all-beautiful art thou, O Sūrya, maker of the light,  
  Illuming all the radiant realm.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300220">20</span></span>Thou goest
to the hosts of Gods, thou comest hither to mankind,  
  Hither, all light to behold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300221">21</span></span>With that
same eye of thine wherewith thou seest, brilliant  
  Varuna.  
  The active one among mankind,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300222">22</span></span>Traversing
sky and wide mid-air, thou metest with thy beams  
   our days,  
  Sun, seeing all things that have life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300223">23</span></span>Seven bay
steeds harnessed to thy car bear thee, O thou far-  
   seeing One, <span id="page_117">p. 117</span>  
  God, Sūrya, with the radiant hair.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300224">24</span></span>Sūrya, hath
yoked the pure bright seven, the daughters of the  
   car, with these,  
  His own dear team, he travelleth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300225">25</span></span>Devout,
aflame with fervent heat, Rohita hath gone up to  
   heaven.  
  He is re-born, returning to his birthplace, and hath become the  
  Gods' imperial ruler.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300226">26</span></span>Dear unto
all men, facing all directions, with hands and palms  
   on every side extended,  
  He, the sole God, engendering earth and heaven, beareth them  
   with his wings and arms together.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300227">27</span></span>The
single-footed hath outstepped the biped, the biped overtakes  
   the triple-footed.  
  The biped hath outstridden the six-footed: these sit around the  
   single-footed's body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300228">28</span></span>When he,
unwearied, fain to go, hath mounted his bays, he  
   makes two colours, brightly shining.  
  Rising with banners, conquering the regions, thou sendest light  
   through all the floods, Āditya.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300229">29</span></span>Verily,
Sūrya, thou art great: truly, Āditya, thou art great.  
  Great is thy grandeur, Mighty One: thou, O Āditya, thou art  
   great.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300230">30</span></span>In heaven,
O Bird, and in mid-air thou shinest: thou shinest on  
   the earth and in the waters.  
  Thou hast pervaded both the seas with splendour: a God art  
   thou, O God, light-winner, mighty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300231">31</span></span>Soaring in
mid-course hither from the distance, fleet and ins-  
   pired, the Bird that flies above us,  
  With might advancing Vishnu manifested, he conquers all that  
   moves with radiant banner:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300232">32</span></span>Brilliant,
observant, mighty Lord, an Eagle illuming both the  
   spheres and air between them.  
  Day and the Night, clad in the robes of Sūrya, spread forth more  
   widely all his hero powers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300233">33</span></span>Flaming and
radiant, strengthening his body, bestowing floods  
   that promptly come to meet us,  
  He, luminous, winged, mighty, strength-bestower, hath mounted  
   all the regions as he forms them. <span id="page_118">p. 118</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300234">34</span></span>Bright
presence of the Gods, the luminous herald Sūrya hath  
   mounted the celestial regions.  
  Day's maker, he hath shone away the darkness, and radiant,  
   passed o'er places hard to traverse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300235">35</span></span>He hath
gone up on high, the Gods' bright presence, the eye of  
  Mitra, Varuna and Agni.  
  The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, Sūrya hath filled the  
   earth and air and heaven,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300236">36</span></span>High in the
midst of heaven may we behold thee whom men call  
  Savitar, the bright red Eagle,  
  Soaring and speeding on thy way, refulgent, unwasting light  
   which Atri erst discovered.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300237">37</span></span>Him, Son of
Aditi, an Eagle hasting along heaven's height, I  
   supplicate in terror,  
  As such prolong our lengthened life, O Sūrya: may we, unha-  
   rmed, enjoy thy gracious favour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300238">38</span></span>This
gold-hued Hansa's wings, soaring to heaven, spread o'er a  
   thousand days' continued journey  
  Supporting all the Gods upon his bosom, he goes his way behold-  
   ing every creature.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300239">39</span></span>Rohita, in
primeval days Prajāpati, was, after, Time, Mouth of  
   all sacrifices, he, Rohita, brought celestial light.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300240">40</span></span>He, Rohita,
became the world: Rohita gave the heaven its heat.  
  Rohita with his beams of light travelled along the earth and sea.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300241">41</span></span>To all the
regions Rohita came, the imperial Lord of heaven.  
  He watches over ocean, heaven, and earth and all existing things.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300242">42</span></span>Mounting
the lofty ones, he, bright, unwearied, splendidly  
   shining, makes two separate colours,  
  While through all worlds that are he sends his lustre, radiant,  
   observant, mighty, wind-approacher.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300243">43</span></span>One form
comes on, the other is reverted: to day and night the  
  Strong One shapes and fits him.  
  With humble prayer for aid we call on Sūrya, who knows the  
   way, whose home is in the region.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300244">44</span></span>The
suppliant's way, filling the earth, the Mighty circleth the  
   world with eye that none deceiveth.  
  May he, all-seeing, well-disposed and holy, give ear and listen to  
   the word I utter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300245">45</span></span>Blazing
with light his majesty hath compassed ocean and earth  
   and heaven and air's mid-region. <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>  
  May he, all-seeing, well-disposed and holy, give ear and listen to  
   the word I utter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300246">46</span></span>Agni is
weakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who  
   cometh like a milch-cow,  
  Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames  
   are mounting to the vault of heaven.
