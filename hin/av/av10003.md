### HYMN III

#### Purusha, Primeval Man or humanity personified

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000301">1</span></span>Here is my
charm the Varana, slayer of rivals, strong in act.  
  With this grasp thou thine enemies, crush those who fain would  
   injure thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000302">2</span></span>Break them
in pieces; grasp them and destroy them. This Amu-  
   let shall go before and lead thee.  
  With Varana the Gods, from morn to morning, have warded off  
   the Asuras' enchantment.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000303">3</span></span>This charm,
this Varana healeth all diseases, bright with a thou-  
   sand eyes and golden glister.  
  This charm shall conquer and cast down thy foemen. Be thou  
   the first to slay the men who hate thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000304">4</span></span>This will
stay witchcraft wrought for thee, will guard thee from  
   the fear of man:  
  From all distress and misery this Varana will shield thee well.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000305">5</span></span>Guard
against ill of varied kind is Varana this heavenly Plant.  
  The Gods have stayed and driven off Consumption which had  
   seized this man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000306">6</span></span>If in thy
sleep thou see an evil vision, oft as the beast repeats his  
   loathed approaches,  
  This Amulet, this Varana will guard thee from sneeze, and from  
   the bird's ill-omened message.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000307">7</span></span>From
Mischief, from Malignity, from incantation, from alarm,  
  From death, from stronger foeman's stroke the Varana will  
   guard thee well.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000308">8</span></span>Each sinful
act that we have done,—my mother, father, and my  
   friends,— <span id="page_10">p. 10</span>  
  From all the guilt this heavenly Plant will be our guard and  
   sure defence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000309">9</span></span>Affrighted
by the Varana let my rivals near akin to me  
  Pass to the region void of light: to deepest darkness let them  
   go.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000310">10</span></span>Safe are my
cattle, safe am I, long-lived with all my men  
   around.  
  This Varana, mine Amulet, shall guard me well on every side.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000311">11</span></span>This Varana
is on my breast, the sovran, the celestial Plant.  
  Let it afflict my foemen as Indra quelled fiends and Asuras.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000312">12</span></span>Through
hundred autumn seasons, long to live, I wear this  
   Varana.  
  May it bestow on me great strength, cattle, and royalty and  
   power.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000313">13</span></span>As with its
might the wind breaks down the trees, the sovrans  
   of the wood,  
  So break and rend my rivals, born before me and born after.  
  Let the Varana protect thee well.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000314">14</span></span>As Agni and
the wind devour the trees, the sovrans of the wood,  
  Even so devour my rivals, born before me and born after. Let  
   the Varana protect thee well.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000315">15</span></span>As,
shattered by the tempest, trees lie withering ruined on the  
   ground.  
  Thus over throw my rivals thou, so crush them down and ruin.  
   them, those born before and after. Let this Varana protect  
   thee well.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000316">16</span></span>Cut them in
pieces, Varana! before their destined term of life,  
  Those who would hurt his cattle, those who fain would harm.  
   the realm he rules.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000317">17</span></span>As Sūrya
shines with brightest sheen, as splendour hath been  
   stored in him,  
  So may the Charm, the Varana, give me prosperity and fame.  
  With lustre let it sprinkle me, and balm me with magni-  
   ficence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000318">18</span></span>As glory
dwelleth in the Moon and in the Sun who vieweth  
   men,  
  So may the Charm, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000319">19</span></span>As glory
dwelleth in the Earth, and in this Jātavedas here,  
  So may the Charm etc. <span id="page_11">p. 11</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000320">20</span></span>As glory
dwelleth in a maid, and in this well-constructed car,  
  So may the Charm, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000321">21</span></span>As glory
dwelleth in the draught of Soma and the honeyed.  
   drink,  
  So may the Charm, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000322">22</span></span>As glory
dwells in sacrifice to Agni, and the hallowing word,  
  So may the Charm, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000323">23</span></span>As glory is
bestowed upon the patron and this sacrifice,  
  So may the Charm, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000324">24</span></span>As glory
dwelleth in the Lord of Life and in this God Supreme,.  
  So may the Charm, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000325">25</span></span>As
immortality and truth have been established in the Gods,  
  So may the Charm, the Varana, give me prosperity and fame.  
  With lustre let it sprinkle me, and balm me with magnificence.
