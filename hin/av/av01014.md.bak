### HYMN XIV

#### A woman's incantation against a rival

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0101401">1</span></span>As from the
tree a wreath, have I assumed her fortune and her  
   fame:  
  Among her kinsfolk long may she dwell, like a mountain broadly-  
   based.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0101402">2</span></span>King Yama,
let this maiden be surrendered as a wife to thee:  
  Bound let her be meanwhile within, her mother's, brother's,  
   father's house.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0101403">3</span></span>Queen of thy
race is she, O King: to thee do we deliver her.  
  Long with her kinsfolk may she sit, until her hair be white with  
   age.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0101404">4</span></span>With Asita's
and Kasyapa's and Gaya's incantation, thus  
  As sisters pack within a chest, I bind and tie thy fortune up.
