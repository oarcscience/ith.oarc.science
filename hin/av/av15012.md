### HYMN XII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501201">1</span></span>The man, to
whose house, when the fires have been taken up  
   from the hearth and the oblation to Agni placed therein, the  
  Vrātya possessing this knowledge comes as a guest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501202">2</span></span>Should of
his own accord rise to meet him and say, Vrātya, give  
   me permission. I will sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501203">3</span></span>And if he
gives permission he should sacrifice, if he does not  
   permit him he should not sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501204">4</span></span>He who
sacrifices when permitted by the Vrātya who possesses  
   this knowledge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501205">5</span></span>Well knows
the path that leads to the Fathers and the way that.  
   leads to the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501206">6</span></span>He does not
act in opposition to the Gods. It becomes his  
   sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501207">7</span></span>The abode of
the man who sacrifices when permitted by the  
  Vrātya who possesses this knowledge is long left remaining in  
   this world.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501208">8</span></span>But he who
sacrifices without the permission of the Vrātya who-  
    possesses this knowledge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501209">9</span></span>Knows not
the path that leads to the Fathers nor the way that  
   leads to the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501210">10</span></span>He is at
variance with the Gods. He hath offered no accepted.  
   sacrifice. <span id="page_158">p. 158</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501211">11</span></span>The abode
of the man who sacrifices without the permission of  
   the Vrātya who possesses this knowledge is not left remaining  
   in this world.
