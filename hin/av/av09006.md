### HYMN VI

#### A glorification of hospitable reception of guests

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900601">1</span></span>Whoso will
know Prayer with immediate knowledge, whose mem-  
   bers are the stuff, whose spine the verses:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900602">2</span></span>Whose hairs
are psalms, whose heart is called the Yajus, whose  
   coverlet is verily oblation—  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900603">3</span></span>Verily when
a host looks at his guests he looks at the place of  
   sacrifice to the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900604">4</span></span>When he
salutes them reverently he undergoes preparation for  
   a religious ceremony: when he calls for water, he solemnly  
   brings sacrificial water.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900605">5</span></span>The water
that is solemnly brought at a sacrifice is this same  
   water.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900606">6</span></span>The libation
which they bring; the sacrificial victim dedicated  
   to Agni and Soma which is tied to the post, that, verily, is  
   this man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900607">7</span></span>When they
arrange dwelling-rooms they arrange the sacred  
   chamber and the shed for housing the Soma cars.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900608">8</span></span>What they
spread upon the floor is just Sacrificial Grass.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900609">9</span></span>With the
couch that the men bring, he wins for himself the  
   world of Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900610">10</span></span>The
pillow-coverings that they bring are the green sticks that  
   surround the sacrificial altar.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900611">11</span></span>The
ointment that they bring for injunction is just clarified  
   liquid butter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900612">12</span></span>The food
they bring before the general distribution represents  
   the two sacrificial cakes of rice meal. <span id="page_a374">p.
a374</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900613">13</span></span>When they
call the man who prepares food they summon the  
   preparer of oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900614">14</span></span>The grains
of rice and barley that are selected are just filaments  
   of the Soma plant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900615">15</span></span>The pestle
and mortar are really the stones of the Soma press.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900616">16</span></span>The
winnowing-basket is the filter, the chaff the Soma dregs,  
   the water, the pressing-gear.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900617">17</span></span>Spoon,
ladle, fork, stirring-prong are the wooden Soma tubs;  
   the earthen cooking-pots are the mortar-shaped Soma  
   vessels; this earth is just the black-antelope's skin.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900618">18</span></span>Or the host
acts in this way to a Yajamāna's Brāhman: when  
   he looks at the furniture and utensils he says, More here t  
   yet more here.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900619">19</span></span>When he
says, Bring out more, he lengthens his life thereby.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900620">20</span></span>He brings
oblations: he makes the men sit down.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900621">21</span></span>As the
guest of the seated company he himself offers up  
   sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900622">22</span></span>With ladle,
with hand, in life, at the sacrificial post, with cry of  
  Ladle! with exclamation of Vashat!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900623">23</span></span>Now these
guests, as priests beloved or not beloved, bring one  
   to the world of Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900624">24</span></span>He who hath
this knowledge should not eat hating, should not  
   eat the food of one who hates him, nor of one who is doubt-  
   ful, nor of one who is undecided.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900625">25</span></span>This man
whose food they eat hath all his wickedness blotted  
   out.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900626">26</span></span>All that
man's sin whose food they do not eat remains unblot-  
   ted out.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900627">27</span></span>The man who
supplies food hath always pressing stones adjusted,  
   a wet Soma filter, well prepared religious rites, and mental  
   power to complete the arranged sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900628">28</span></span>The
arranged sacrifice of the man who offers food is a sacrifice  
   to Prajāpati.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900629">29</span></span>The man who
offers food follows the steps of Prajāpati.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900630">30</span></span>The fire of
the guests is the Āhavaniya, the fire in the dwelling  
   is the Gārhapatya, that whereon they cook food is the South-  
   ern Sacrificial Fire.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900631">31</span></span>Now that
man who eats before the guest eats up the sacrifice  
   and the merit of the house.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900632">32</span></span>He devours
the milk and the sap: <span id="page_a375">p. a375</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900633">33</span></span>And the
vigour and prosperity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900634">34</span></span>And the
progeny and the cattle:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900635">35</span></span>And the
fame and reputation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900636">36</span></span>The man who
eats before the guest eats up the glory and the  
   understanding of the house.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900637">37</span></span>The man
should not eat before the guest who is a Brāhman  
   versed in holy lore.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900638">38</span></span>When the
guest hath eaten he should eat. This is the rule for  
   the animation of the sacrifice and the preservation of its  
   continuity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900639">39</span></span>Now the
sweetest portion, the produce of the cow, milk, or  
   flesh, that verily he should not eat.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900640">40</span></span>The man who
having this knowledge pours out milk and offers  
   it wins for himself as much thereby as he gains by the perfor-  
   mance of a very successful Agnishtoma sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900641">41</span></span>The man who
having this knowledge pours out clarified butter  
   and offers it wins for himself thereby as much as he gains by  
   the performance of a very successful Atirātra sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900642">42</span></span>He who
pours out mead and offers it wins for himself thereby  
   as much as he gains by the performance of a very successful  
  Sattrasadya sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900643">43</span></span>He who
having this knowledge besprinkles flesh and offers it  
   wins for himself thereby as much as he gains by the perfor-  
   mance of a very successful Twelve-Day sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900644">44</span></span>The man who
having this knowledge pours out water and offers  
   it obtains a resting-place for the procreation of living beings  
   and becomes dear to living beings, even the man who having  
   this knowledge pours out water and offers it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900645">45</span></span>For him
Dawn murmurs, and Savitar sings the prelude; Brihas-  
   pati chants with vigour, and Tvashtar joins in with increase;  
   the Visve Devāh take up conclusion. He who hath this know-  
   ledge is the abiding-place of welfare, of progeny, and of  
   cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900646">46</span></span>For him the
rising Sun murmurs, and Early Morning sings the  
   prelude; Noon chants the psalm, Afternoon joins in; the  
   setting Sun takes up the conclusion. He who hath this know-  
   ledge is the abiding place of welfare, of progeny, and of  
   cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900647">47</span></span>For him the
Rain-cloud murmurs when present, sings the pre-  
   lude when thundering, joins in when lightening, chants the <span
id="page_a376">p. a376</span>  
   psalm when raining, and takes up the conclusion when it stays  
   the downpour. He who hath this knowledge is the abiding-  
   place of welfare, of progeny, and of cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900648">48</span></span>He looks at
the guests, he utters a gentle sound; he speaks, he  
   signs the prelude; he calls for water, he chants the psalm; he  
   offers the residue of the sacrifice, he takes up the conclusion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900649">49</span></span>When he
summons the door-keeper he gives instruction.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900650">50</span></span>He (the
door-keeper) pronounces the sacrificial formula in his  
   answer to what he hears.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900651">51</span></span>When the
attendants with vessels in their hands, foremost and  
   hindmost, come in, they are just the priests who manage the  
  Soma cups.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900652">52</span></span>Not one of
them is incompetent to sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900653">53</span></span>Or if the
host, having offered food to his guest, goes up to the  
   house, he virtually enters the bath of purification.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900654">54</span></span>When he
distributes food he distributes priestly fees; what he  
   performs he asks as favour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900655">55</span></span>He having
been invited on earth, regales, invited in that, which  
   wears all various forms on earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900656">56</span></span>He, having
been invited in air, regales, invited, in that which  
   wears all various forms in air.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900657">57</span></span>He having
been invited in the sky, regales, invited, in that which  
   wears all various forms in the sky.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900658">58</span></span>He, having
been invited among the gods, regales, invited in that  
   which wears all various forms among the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900659">59</span></span>He, having
been invited in the worlds, regales, invited, in that  
   which wears all various forms in the worlds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900660">60</span></span>He, having
been invited hath been invited.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900661">61</span></span>He gains
this world and the world yonder.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900662">62</span></span>He who hath
this knowledge wins the luminous spheres.
