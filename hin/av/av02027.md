### HYMN XXVII

#### A charm against an opponent in debate

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202701">1</span></span>Let not the
enemy win the cause! Strong and predominant art  
   thou.  
  Refute mine adversary's speech. Render them dull and flat, O  
  Plant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202702">2</span></span>The
strong-winged bird discovered thee, the boar unearthed thee  
   with his snout.  
  Refute mine adversary's speech. Render them dull and flat, O  
  Plant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202703">3</span></span>Yea, Indra
laid thee on his arm, to cast the Asuras to the  
   ground.  
  Refute mine adversary's speech. Render them dull and flat, O  
  Plant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202704">4</span></span>Indra
devoured the Pātā plant that he might lay the Asuras  
   low.  
  Refute mine adversary's speech! Render them dull and flat, O  
  Plant. <span id="page_a54">p. a54</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202705">5</span></span>With this I
overcome my foes as Indra overcame the wolves.  
  Refute mine adversary's speech! Render them dull and flat, O  
  Plant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202706">6</span></span>O Rudra,
Lord of Healing Balms, dark-crested, skilful in thy  
   work!—  
  Refute mine adversary's speech. Render them dull and flat, O  
  Plant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202707">7</span></span>Indra,
defeat the speech of him who meets us with hostility.  
  Comfort us with thy power and might. Make me superior in  
   debate.
