### HYMN LXXXVII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008701">1</span></span>Priests,
offer to the Lord of all the people the milked-out stalk  
   of Soma, radiant-coloured.  
  No wild bull knows his drinking-place like Indra who ever seeks  
   him who hath pressed the Soma.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008702">2</span></span>Thou dost
desire to drink, each day that passes, the pleasant  
   food which thou hast had aforetime.  
  O Indra, gratified in heart and spirit, drink eagerly the Soma set  
   before thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008703">3</span></span>Thou,
newly-born, for strength didst drink the Soma; thy  
   mother told thee of thy future greatness.  
  O Indra, thou hast filled mid-air's wide region, and given the  
  Gods by battle room and freedom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008704">4</span></span>When thou
hast urged the arrogant to combat, proud in their  
   strength of arm, we will subdue them.  
  Or, Indra, when thou fightest girt by heroes, we in the glorious  
   fray with thee will conquer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008705">5</span></span>I will
declare the earliest deeds of Indra, and recent acts which  
  Maghavan hath accomplished.  
  When he had conquered godless wiles and magic, Soma became  
   his own entire possession.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008706">6</span></span>Thine is
this world of flocks and herds around thee, which with  
   the eye of Surya thou beholdest.  
  Thou, Indra, art alone the Lord of cattle: may we enjoy the  
   treasure which thou givest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008707">7</span></span>Ye twain are
Lords of wealth in earth and heaven, thou, O  
  Brihaspati, and thou, O Indra .  
  Mean though he be, give wealth to him who lauds you. Preserve  
   us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
