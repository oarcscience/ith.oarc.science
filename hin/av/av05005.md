### HYMN V

#### A charm to mend a broken bone

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500501">1</span></span>Aryaman is
thy grandsire, Night thy mother, and the Cloud thy  
   sire.  
  Thy name is called Silāchi. Thou, thyself, art sister of the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500502">2</span></span>Whoever
drinketh thee hath life: thou savest and protectest  
   man.  
  As nursing mother of mankind, thou takest all upon thy lap.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500503">3</span></span>Thou
clingest close to every tree, as a fond damsel clasps her  
   love. <span id="page_a160">p. a160</span>  
  Thy name is called The Conqueror, She who Stands Fast, The  
  Rescuer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500504">4</span></span>Whatever
wound the arrow, or the staff, or violence inflicts,  
  Thereof thou art the remedy: as such restore this man to health.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500505">5</span></span>Thou
springest from blest Plaxa, or Asvattha, Dhava, Khadira,  
  Parna, or blest Nyagrodha, so come thou to use, Arundhatī!  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0500506">6</span></span>Gold-coloured, bringing happy fate, most
lovely, brilliant as the  
  Sun,  
  Mayst thou, O Healing! come unto the fracture: Healing is thy  
   name.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0500507">7</span></span>Gold-coloured, bringing happy fate,
odorous, hairy-bodied one,  
  The sister of the Waters art thou, Lākshā! and thy soul is Wind.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500508">8</span></span>Silāchi is
thy name: thy sire, O goat-brown! is a damsel's son.  
  Thou hast been sprinkled by the mouth of Yama's tawny-  
   coloured horse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500509">9</span></span>Issuing from
the horse's blood away she glided to the trees.  
  Become a winged water-brook, and come to us, Arundhatī!
