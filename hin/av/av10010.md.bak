### HYMN X

#### A glorification of the sacred Cow as representing the radiant heavens

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001001">1</span></span>Worship to
thee springing to life, and worship unto thee when  
   born!  
  Worship, O Cow, to thy tail-hair, and to thy hooves, and to thy  
   form!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001002">2</span></span>The man who
knows the Seven Floods, who knows the seven  
   distances,  
  Who knows the head of sacrifice, he may receive the holy Cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001003">3</span></span>I know the
Seven Water-floods, I know the seven distances,  
  I know the head of sacrifice, and Soma shining bright in her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001004">4</span></span>Hitherward
we invite with prayer the Cow who pours a thou-  
   sand streams,  
  By whom the heaven, by whom the earth, by whom these waters  
   are preserved.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001005">5</span></span>Upon her
back there are a hundred keepers, a hundred metal  
   bowls, a hundred milkers.  
  The Deities who breathe in her all separately know the Cow. <span
id="page_37">p. 37</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001006">6</span></span>Her foot is
sacrifice, her milk libation, Svadhā her breath, Mahï-  
   lukā the mighty:  
  To the God goes with prayer the Cow who hath Parjanya for  
   her lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001007">7</span></span>Agni hath
entered into thee; Soma, O Cow, hath entered thee.  
  Thine udder is Parjanya, O blest Cow; the lightnings are thy  
   teats.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001008">8</span></span>Thou pourest
out the Waters first, and corn-lands afterward,  
  O Cow.  
  Thirdly thou pourest princely sway. O Cow, thou pourest food  
   and milk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001009">9</span></span>When, Holy
One, thou camest nigh invited by the Ādityas' call,  
  Indra gave thee to drink, O cow, a thousand bowls of Soma  
   juice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001010">10</span></span>The Bull,
what time thou followedst the way of Indra, summon-  
   ed thee:  
  Thence the Fiend-slayer, angered, took thy water and thy milk  
   away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001011">11</span></span>O Cow, the
milk which in his wrath the Lord of Riches took  
   from thee,  
  That same the vault of heaven now preserveth in three reser-  
   voirs.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001012">12</span></span>The Cow
Celestial received that Soma in three vessels, where.  
  Atharvan, consecrated, sate upon the Sacred Grass of gold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001013">13</span></span>Come hither
with the Soma, come with every footed thing; the  
  Cow  
  With Kalis and Gandharvas by her side hath stepped upon the  
   sea.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001014">14</span></span>Come hither
with the Wind, yea, come with every creature borne  
   on wings.  
  Laden with holy verse and song the Cow hath leapt into the  
   sea.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001015">15</span></span>Come with
the Sun, come hitherward with every creature that  
   hath eyes,  
  Bearing auspicious lights with her the Cow hath looked across  
   the sea.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001016">16</span></span>When,
covered round about with gold, thou stoodest there, O  
  Holy One,  
  The ocean turned into a horse and mounted on thy back, O  
  Cow, <span id="page_38">p. 38</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001017">17</span></span>Then came
and met the Blessed Ones, Deshtri, the Cow, and  
  Svadhā, where  
  Atharvan, consecrated. sate upon the Sacred Grass of gold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001018">18</span></span>The
Kshatriya's mother is the Cow, thy mother, Svadhā! is the  
  Cow.  
  Sacrifice is the weapon of the Cow: the thought arose from,  
   her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001019">19</span></span>From
Brahma's summit there went forth a drop that mounted  
   up on high:  
  From that wast thou produced, O Cow, from that the Hotar  
   sprang to life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001020">20</span></span>Forth from
thy mouth the Gāthās came, from thy neck's nape  
   sprang strength, O Cow.  
  Sacrifice from thy flanks was born, and rays of sunlight from.  
   thy teats,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001021">21</span></span>From thy
fore-quarters and thy thighs motion was generated,  
  Cow!  
  Food from thine entrails was produced, and from thy belly came  
   the plants.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001022">22</span></span>When into
Varuna's belly thou hadst found a passage for thy-  
   self,  
  The Brāhman called thee thence, for he knew how to guide and  
   lead thee forth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001023">23</span></span>All
trembled at the babe that came from him who brings not to  
   the birth.  
  He hath produced her—thus they cried—He is a cow, and formed  
   by spells, he hath become skin to her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001024">24</span></span>He only
joineth battle, yea, he who alone controlleth her.  
  Now sacrifices have become victories, and the Cow their eye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001025">25</span></span>The Cow
hath welcomed sacrifice: the Cow hath held the Sun  
   in place.  
  Together with the prayer the mess of rice hath passed into the  
  Cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001026">26</span></span>They call
the Cow immortal life, pay homage to the Cow as  
  Death.  
  She hath become this universe, Fathers, and Rishis, hath become  
   the Gods, and men, and Asuras.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001027">27</span></span>The man who
hath this knowledge may receive the Cow with.  
   welcoming. <span id="page_39">p. 39</span>  
  So for the giver willingly doth perfect sacrifice pour milk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001028">28</span></span>Within the
mouth of Varuna three tongues are glittering with  
   light.  
  That which shines midmost of them is this Cow most difficult to  
   hold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001029">29</span></span>Four-parted
was the Cow's prolific humour.  
  One-fourth is Water, one-fourth life eternal, one-fourth is sacri-  
   fice, one-fourth are cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001030">30</span></span>The Cow is
Heaven, the Cow is Earth, the Cow is Vishnu, Lord  
   of Life.  
   e The Sādhyas and the Vasus have drunk the out-pourings of the  
  Cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001031">31</span></span>When these,
Sādhyas and Vasus, have drunk the out-pourings of  
   the Cow,  
  They in the Bright One's dwelling-place pay adoration to her  
   milk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001032">32</span></span>For Soma
some have milked her: some worship the fatness she  
   hath poured.  
  They who have given a cow to him who hath this knowledge  
   have gone up to the third region of the sky.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001033">33</span></span>He who hath
given a Cow unto the Brāhmans winneth all the  
   worlds.  
  For Right is firmly set in her devotion, and religious zeal.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1001034">34</span></span>Both Gods
and mortal men depend for life and being on the  
  Cow.  
  She hath become this universe: all that the Sun surveys is she.
