### HYMN XXXIX

#### A protective charm

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903901">1</span></span>Let Kushtha
from the Hill of Snow come, a divine deliverer.  
  Banish thou all Consumption, drive all sorceresses far away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903902">2</span></span>Kushtha,
three several names hast thou, Naghamāra,  
  Naghārisha: let not mishap befall this man,  
  For whom I make a charm of thee at eve, at morning, and by  
   day.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903903">3</span></span>Jivalā is
thy mother's name, thy father's name is Jivala; let not  
   mishap, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903904">4</span></span>Thou art the
best amid the plants, even as the ox is best of  
   tame, the tiger of rapacious beasts: let not mishap, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903905">5</span></span>Born thrice
from the Ādityas, thrice from Bhrigus, thrice from  
  Angiras' sons, born from the Visve Devas thrice, <span
id="page_243">p. 243</span>  
  Healer of every malady, that Kushtha stands by Soma's side.  
  Banish thou all Consumption, drive all sorceresses far away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903906">6</span></span>In the third
heaven above us stands the Asvattha tree, the seat  
   of Gods:  
  There is embodiment of life that dies not: thence was Kushtha  
   born.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903907">7</span></span>There moved
through heaven a golden ship, a ship with cordage  
   wrought of gold:  
  There is embodiment of life that dies not; thence was Kushtha  
   born.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903908">8</span></span>Where is the
Sinking of the Ship, the summit of the Hill of  
  Snow,  
  There is embodiment of life that dies not: thence was Kustha  
   born.  
  Healer of every malady, that Kushtha stands by Soma's side.  
  Banish thou all Consumption, drive all sorceresses far away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903909">9</span></span>Thou whom
Ikshvāku's ancestor, whom he who well-loved  
  Kushtha, knew,  
  Whom Vāyasa and Mātsya knew, hence healer of all ills art  
   thou.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903910">10</span></span>O thou who
hast all-reaching might drive away Fever, drive it  
   down,  
  [Head](errata.htm#1) racking Fever, tertian, continual, lasting for a
year.
