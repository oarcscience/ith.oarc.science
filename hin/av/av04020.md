### HYMN XX

#### A charm for the acquisition of superhuman powers of sight

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402001">1</span></span>It sees in
front, it sees behind, it sees afar away, it sees  
  The sky, the firmament, and earth: all this, O Goddess, it  
   beholds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402002">2</span></span>Through
thee, O godlike Plant, may I behold all creatures that  
   exist,  
  Three several heavens, three several earths, and these six regions  
   one by one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402003">3</span></span>The pupil,
verily, art thou of that celestial Engle's eye.  
  On earth hast thou alighted as a weary woman seeks her couch.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402004">4</span></span>The God who
hath a thousand eyes give me this Plant in my  
   right hand!  
  I look on every one therewith, each Sūdra and each Āryan man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402005">5</span></span>Make
manifest the forms of things; hide not their essences from  
   sight.  
  And, thou who hast a thousand eyes, look the Kimidins in the  
   face. <span id="page_a129">p. a129</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402006">6</span></span>Make me see
Yātudhānas, make thou Yātudhānis visible.  
  Make me see all Pisāchas With this prayer, O Plant, I hold thee  
   fast.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402007">7</span></span>Thou art the
sight of Kasyapa and of the hound who hath four  
   eyes.  
  Make the Pisācha manifest as Sūrya when he rides at noon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402008">8</span></span>Kimidin,
Yātudhāna from their hiding-places have I dragged.  
  I look on every one with this, Sūdra and Aryan man alike.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402009">9</span></span>Make that
Pisācha visible, the fiend who flies in middle air,  
  The fiend who glides across the sky, and him who deems the  
   earth his help.
