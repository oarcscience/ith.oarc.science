### HYMN II

#### Prayer and praise to Bhava, Sarva and Rudra

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100201">1</span></span>Bhava and
Sarva, spare us, be not hostile. Homage to you, twin  
  Lords of beasts and spirits!  
  Shoot not the arrow aimed and drawn against us: forbear to  
   harm our quadrupeds and bipeds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100202">2</span></span>Cast not our
bodies to the dog or jackal, nor, Lord of Beasts!  
   to carrion-kites or vultures.  
  Let not thy black voracious flies attack them; let not thy birds  
   obtain them for their banquet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100203">3</span></span>We offer
homage to thy shout, Bhava! thy breath, thy racking  
   pains:  
  Homage, Immortal One! to thee, to Rudra of the thousand  
   eyes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100204">4</span></span>We offer
reverence to thee from eastward, and from north and  
   south,  
  From all the compass of the sky, to thee and to the firmament.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100205">5</span></span>Homage, O
Bhava, Lord of Beasts, unto thy face and all thine  
   eyes,  
  To skin, and hue, and aspect, and to thee when looked at from  
   behind!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100206">6</span></span>We offer
homage to thy limbs, thy belly, and thy tongue, and  
   mouth we offer homage to thy smell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100207">7</span></span>Never may we
contend with him, the mighty archer, thousand-  
   eyed. <span id="page_47">p. 47</span>  
  Rudra who wears black tufts of hair, the slaughterer of  
  Ardhaka.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100208">8</span></span>May he, may
Bhava from all sides avoid us, avoid us even as  
   fire avoids the waters. Let him not threaten us. To him be  
   homage!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100209">9</span></span>Four times,
eight times be homage paid to Bhava, yea, Lord of  
  Beasts, ten times be reverence paid thee!  
  Thine are these animals, five several classes, oxen, and goats and  
   sheep, and men, and horses  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100210">10</span></span>Thine the
four regions, thine are earth and heaven, thine,  
  Mighty One, this firmament between them;  
  Thine everything with soul and breath here on the surface of the  
   land.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100211">11</span></span>Thine is
this ample wealth-containing storehouse that holds with-  
   in it all these living creatures.  
  Favour us, Lord of Beasts, to thee be homage! Far from us go  
   ill-omens, dogs, and jackals, and wild-haired women with  
   their horrid shrieking!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100212">12</span></span>A yellow
bow of gold thou wieldest, slaying its hundred, tufted  
  God! smiting its thousand.  
  Weapon of Gods, far flies the shaft of Rudra: wherever it may  
   be, we pay it homage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100213">13</span></span>Thou,
Rudra, followest close the foe who lies in wait to conquer  
   thee.  
  Even as a hunter who pursues the footsteps of the wounded  
   game.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100214">14</span></span>Accordant
and allies, Bhava and Rudra, with mighty strength ye  
   go to deeds of valour. Wherever they may be, we pay them  
   homage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100215">15</span></span>Be homage,
Rudra, unto thee approaching and departing hence!  
  Homage to thee when standing still, to thee when seated and at  
   rest!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100216">16</span></span>Homage at
evening and at morn, homage at night, homage by  
   day .  
  To Bhava and to Sarva, both, have I paid lowly reverence,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100217">17</span></span>Let us not
outrage with our tongue far-seeing Rudra, thousand-  
   eyed,  
  Inspired with varied lore, who shoots his arrows forward, far  
   away. <span id="page_48">p. 48</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100218">18</span></span>Foremost we
go to meet his car, the chariot of the long-haired  
  God,  
  Drawn by brown horses, dusky, black, o'erthrowing, slaying,  
   terrible. Let reverence be paid to him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100219">19</span></span>Cast not
thy club at us, thy heavenly weapon. Lord of Beasts,  
   be not wroth with us. Let reverence be paid to thee.  
  Shake thy celestial branch above some others elsewhere, not o'er  
   us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100220">20</span></span>Do us no
harm, but comfort us: avoid thou us, and be not  
   wroth. Never let us contend with thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100221">21</span></span>Covet not
thou our kine or men, covet not thou our goats or  
   sheep.  
  Elsewhither, strong One! turn thine aim: destroy the mockers'  
   family.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100222">22</span></span>Homage to
him whose weapon, Cough or Fever, assails one like  
   the neighing of a stallion; to him who draws one forth and  
   then another!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100223">23</span></span>Homage be
paid him with ten Sakvari verses who stands  
   established in the air's mid-region, slaying non-sacrificing  
  God-despisers!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100224">24</span></span>For thee
were forest beasts and sylvan creatures placed in the  
   wood, and small birds, swans, and eagles.  
  Floods, Lord of Beasts! contain thy living beings: to swell thy  
   strength flow the celestial Waters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100225">25</span></span>Porpoises,
serpents, strange aquatic monsters, fishes, and things  
   unclean at which thou shootest.  
  Nothing is far for thee, naught checks thee, Bhava! The whole  
   earth in a moment thou surveyest. From the east sea thou  
   smitest in the northern.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100226">26</span></span>O'erwhelm
us not with Fever or with poison, nor, Rudra! with  
   the fire that comes from heaven. Elsewhere, and not on us,  
   cast down this lightning.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100227">27</span></span>Ruler of
heaven and Lord of earth is Bhava: Bhava hath filled  
   the spacious air's mid-region. Where'er he be, to him be paid  
   our homage!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100228">28</span></span>King Bhava,
favour him who offers worship, for thou art  
  Pasupati, Lord of victims.  
  Be gracious to the quadruped and biped of the believer in the  
  Gods' existence. <span id="page_49">p. 49</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100229">29</span></span>Harm thou
among us neither great nor little, not one who bears  
   us, not our future bearers.  
  Injure no sire among us, harm no mother. Forbear to injure our  
   own bodies, Rudra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100230">30</span></span>This lowly
reverence have I paid to Rudra's dogs with mighty  
   mouths,  
  Hounds terrible with bark and howl, who gorge unmasticated  
   food.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100231">31</span></span>Homage to
thy loud-shouting hosts and thy long-haired  
   followers!  
  Homage to hosts that are adored, homage to armies that enjoy  
  Homage to all thy troops, O God. Security and bliss be ours!
