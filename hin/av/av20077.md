### HYMN LXXVII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007701">1</span></span>Impetuous,
true, let Maghavan come hither, and let his tawny  
   coursers speed to reach us.  
  For him have we pressed juice exceeding potent: here, praised  
   with song, let him effect his visit.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007702">2</span></span>Unyoke, as
at thy journey's end, O Hero, to gladden thee to-day  
   at this libation.  
  Like Usanā, the priest a laud shall utter, a hymn to thee, the  
  Lord Divine, who markest. <span id="page_328">p. 328</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007703">3</span></span>When the
Bull quaffing praises our libation, as a sage paying  
   holy rites in secret,  
  Seven singers here from heaven hath he begotten, who e'en by  
   day have wrought their works while singing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007704">4</span></span>When
heaven's fair light by hymns was made apparent. (they  
   made great splendour shine at break of morning),  
  He with his succour, best of heroes, scattered the blinding dark-  
   ness so that men saw clearly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007705">5</span></span>Indra,
impetuous One, hath waxed immensely: he with his  
   vastness hath filled earth and heaven.  
  E'en beyond this his majesty extendeth who hath exceeded all  
   the worlds in greatness,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007706">6</span></span>Sakra who
knoweth well all human actions hath with his eager  
   friends let loose the waters.  
  They with their songs cleft e'en the mountain open, and willingly  
   disclosed the stall of cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007707">7</span></span>He smote
away the flood's obstructer Vritra: Earth conscious  
   lent her aid to speed thy thunder.  
  Thou sentest forth the waters of the ocean as Lord through  
   power and might, O daring Hero.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007708">8</span></span>When,
Much-invoked! the waters' rock thou deftest, Saramā  
   showed herself and went before thee.  
  Hymned by Angirases, bursting the cowstalls, thou foundest  
   ample strength for us as leader.
