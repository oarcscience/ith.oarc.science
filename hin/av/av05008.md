### HYMN VIII

#### A charm for the discomfiture and destruction of hostile priests

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500801">1</span></span>With fuel of
Vikankata bring molten butter to the Gods.  
  O Agni, make them joyful here: let them all come unto my call.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500802">2</span></span>O Indra,
come unto my call, This will I do. So hear it thou.  
  Let these exertions for the sake of Indra guide my wish aright.  
  Therewith, O Jātavedas, Lord of Bodies! may we win us strength.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500803">3</span></span>Whatever
plot from yonder, O ye Gods, that godless man would  
   frame,  
  Let not the Gods come to his call, nor Agni bear his offering up.  
  Come, ye, come hither to my call.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500804">4</span></span>Run, ye
Fxertions, farther on By Indra's order smite and slay.  
  As a wolf worrieth a sheep, so let not him escape from you  
   while life remains. Stop fast his breath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500805">5</span></span>The Brāhman
whom those yonder have appointed priest, for  
   injury,  
  He, Indra! is beneath thy feet. I cast him to the God of Death.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500806">6</span></span>If they have
issued forth, strongholds of Gods, and made their  
   shield of prayer, <span id="page_a164">p. a164</span>  
  Gaining protection for their lives, protection round about, make  
   all their instigation powerless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500807">7</span></span>Exertions
which that man hath made, Exertions which he yet  
   will make  
  Turn them, O Indra, back again, O Vritra-slayer, back again on  
   him that they may kill that man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500808">8</span></span>As Indra,
having seized him, set his foot upon Udvāchana,  
  Even so for all the coming years I cast those men beneath my  
   feet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500809">9</span></span>Here, Indra
Vritra-slayer, in thy strength pierce thou their vital.  
   parts.  
  Here, even here, attack them, O Indra. Thine own dear friend  
   am I.  
  Indra, we closely cling to thee. May we be in thy favouring  
   grace.
