### HYMN XXVII

#### A hymn to the Maruts

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402701">1</span></span>I think upon
the Maruts: may they bless me, may they assist  
   me to this wealth in battle. <span id="page_a136">p. a136</span>  
  I call them like swift well-trained steeds to help us. May they  
   deliver us from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402702">2</span></span>Those who
surround the never-failing fountain for ever, and  
   bedew the plants with moisture,  
  The Maruts, Prini's sons, I chiefly honour. May they deliver us  
   from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402703">3</span></span>Bards, who
invigorate the milk of milch-kine, the sap of growing  
   plants, the speed of coursers  
  To us may the strong Maruts be auspicious. May they deliver us  
   from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402704">4</span></span>They who
raised water from the sea to heaven and send it from  
   the sky to earth in showers,  
  The Maruts who move mighty with their waters, may they  
   deliver us from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402705">5</span></span>They who
delight in nectar and in fatness, they who bestow  
   upon us health and vigour.  
  The Maruts who rain mighty with their waters, may they deliver  
   us from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402706">6</span></span>Whether with
stormy might the Maruts established this All, or  
  Gods with their celestial power,  
  Ye, kindly Gods, are able to restore it. May they deliver us from  
   grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402707">7</span></span>Potent in
battles is the Maruts' army, impetuous train, well-  
   known, exceeding mighty.  
  I, suppliant, praise and oft invoke the Maruts. May they deliver  
   us from grief and trouble.
