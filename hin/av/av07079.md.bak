### HYMN LXXIX

#### A hymn to the New Moon

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707901">1</span></span>Night of the
New-born Moon, whatever fortune the Gods who  
   dwell with greatness have assigned thee,  
  Therewith fulfil our sacrifice, all-baunteous! Blessed One, grant  
   us wealth with manly offspring.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707902">2</span></span>I am the New
Moon's Night, the good and pious are my in-  
   habitants, these dwell within me.  
  In me have Gods of both the spheres, and Sādhyas, with Indra  
   as their chief, all met together.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707903">3</span></span>The Night
hath come, the gatherer of treasures, bestowing  
   strength, prosperity, and riches.  
  To New Moon's Night let us present oblation: pouring out  
   strength, with milk hath she come hither.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707904">4</span></span>Night of New
Moon! ne'er hath been born another than thou  
   embracing all these forms and natures,  
  May we have what we longed for when we brought thee obla-  
   tions: may we be the lords of riches.
