### HYMN XXXII

#### A charm, with an amulet of Darbha grass, to subdue enemies and win the affection of others

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903201">1</span></span>For
lengthened life I bind on thee the Darbha grass, the mighty  
   plant.  
  Excellent, hard to overthrow, with hundred stems and thousand  
   blades.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903202">2</span></span>They cut not
off his hair, they strike blow upon the breast for'  
   him.  
  To whom one gives protection by Darbha that hath uninjured  
   leaves.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903203">3</span></span>O Plant, thy
root is in the sky, and thou art stationed on the  
   earth:  
  With thee who hast a thousand stalks we strengthen all the  
   powers of life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903204">4</span></span>Through all
three skies the plant hath pierced, and the three  
   regions of the earth;  
  With thee I split in twain the tongue and words of the bad-  
   hearted man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903205">5</span></span>Thou art
victorious in thy might I am endowed with conquering  
   strength:  
  Possessed of overpowering force we two will quell our enemies.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903206">6</span></span>Subdue our
foeman, overcome the men who fain would fight:  
   with us. <span id="page_238">p. 238</span>  
  Conquer all evil-hearted ones: make many well-disposed to me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903207">7</span></span>With Darbha
that hath sprung from Gods, stationed in heaven,  
   full many a time.  
  With this have I won many men, have won and may I win them  
   still.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903208">8</span></span>Do thou, O
Darbha, make me dear to Brāhman and Rājanya,  
   dear to Sūdra, and to Arya dear,  
  Yea, dear to every man we love, to every man with eyes to see.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903209">9</span></span>He who first
born fixed earth in her position, he who established  
   heaven and air's mid-region,  
  Whom sinner ne'er hath known as his supporter,—this Darbha  
   be our shelter and protection!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903210">10</span></span>First of
all plants it sprang into existence, victorious, hundred-  
   stemmed, the foe-subduer,  
  So may this Darbha from all sides protect us: with this may I  
   subdue our foes in battle.
