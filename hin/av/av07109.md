### HYMN CIX

#### A prayer for success in gambling

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0710901">1</span></span>My homage to
the strong, the brown, the sovran lord among  
   the dice!  
  Butter on Kali I bestow: may he be kind to one like me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0710902">2</span></span>Bear butter
to the Apsarases, O Agni, and to the Dice bear dust  
   and sand and water.  
  The Gods delight in both oblations, joying in sacrificial gifts  
   apportioned duly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0710903">3</span></span>The
Apsarases take pleasure in the banquet between the Sun and.  
   the libation-holder.  
  With butter let them fill my hands, and give me, to be my prey,  
   the man who plays against me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0710904">4</span></span>Evil be mine
opponent's luck! Sprinkle thou butter over us.  
  Strike, as a tree with lightning flash, mine adversary in the game.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0710905">5</span></span>The God who
found for us this wealth for gambling, to cast the  
   dice and count the winning number,  
  May he accept the sacrifice we offer, and with Gandharvas revel  
   in the banquet.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0710906">6</span></span>Fellow-inhabitants, such is your title,
for Dice with looks of  
   power support dominion. <span id="page_a318">p. a318</span>  
  As such with offerings may we serve you, Indus! May we have  
   riches in our own possession.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0710907">7</span></span>As I invoke
the Gods at need, as I have lived in chastity,  
  May these, when I have grasped the Dice, the brown, be kind to  
   one like me.
