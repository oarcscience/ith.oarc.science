### HYMN XXX

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003001">1</span></span>In the great
synod will I laud thy two bay steeds: I prize the  
   sweet strong drink of thee the Warrior-God,  
  His who pours lovely oil as'twere with yellow drops. Let my  
   songs enter thee whose form hath golden tints.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003002">2</span></span>Ye who—in
concert sing unto the gold-hued place, like bay steeds  
   driving onward to the heavenly seat,  
  For Indra laud ye strength allied with tawny steeds, laud him  
   whom cows content as'twere with yellow drops.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003003">3</span></span>His is that
thunderbolt, of iron, golden-hued, gold-coloured,  
   very dear, and yellow in his arms;  
  Bright with strong teeth, destroying with its tawny rage. In  
  Indra are set fast all forms of golden hue.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003004">4</span></span>As if a
lovely ray were laid upon the sky, the golden thunder-  
   bolt spread out as in a race.  
  That iron bolt with yellow jaw smote Ahi down. A thousand  
   flames had he who bore the tawny-hued. <span id="page_288">p.
288</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003005">5</span></span>Thou, thou,
when praised by men who sacrificed of old, hadst  
   pleasure in their lauds, O Indra golden-haired.  
  All that befits thy song of praise thou welcomest, the perfect:  
   pleasant gift, O golden-hued from birth.
