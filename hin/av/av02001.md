# BOOK II

### HYMN I

#### Glorification of the prime cause of all things

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200101">1</span></span>Vena beholds
That Highest which lies hidden, wherein this All  
   resumes one form and fashion.  
  Thence Prisni milked all life that had existence: the hosts that  
   know the light with songs extolled her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200102">2</span></span>Knowing
Eternity, may the Gandharva declare to us that highest  
   secret station.  
  Three steps thereof lie hidden in the darkness: he who knows  
   these shall be the father's father.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200103">3</span></span>He is our
kinsman, father, and begetter: he knows all beings  
   and all Ordinances.  
  He only gave the Gods their appellations: all creatures go to  
   him to ask direction.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200104">4</span></span>I have gone
forth around the earth and heaven, I have approached  
   the first-born Son of Order.  
  He, putting voice, as 'twere, within the speaker, stands in the  
   world, he, verily is Agni.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200105">5</span></span>I round the
circumjacent worlds have travelled to see the far-  
   extended thread of Order.  
  Wherein the Gods, obtaining life eternal, have risen upward to  
   one common birthplace.
