### HYMN I

#### An accompaniment to the preparation and presentation of a Brahmaudana

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100101">1</span></span>Agni, spring
forth! Here Aditi, afflicted, cooks a Brahmaudana,  
   yearning for children.  
  Let the Seven Rishis, World-creators, rub thee into existence  
   here with gift of offspring.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100102">2</span></span>Raise, as I
bid, the smoke, my strong companions, lovers of free-  
   dom from deceit and malice!  
  Victor in fight heroic, here is Agni by whom the Gods subdued  
   the hostile demons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100103">3</span></span>Thou, Agni,
wart produced for mighty valour, to cook Brahmau-  
   dana, O Jātavedas.  
  Seven Rishis, makers of the world, begat thee, Grant to this  
   woman wealth with store of heroes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100104">4</span></span>Burn up, O
Agni, kindled with the fuel. Knowing the Gods who  
   merit worship, bring them.  
  Cooking, for these, oblation, Jātavedas! lift up this man to  
   heaven's most lofty summit.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100105">5</span></span>Your portion
from of old is triply parted, portion of Gods, of  
  Fathers, and of mortals.  
  Know, all, your shares. I deal them out among you. The portion  
   of the Gods shall save this woman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100106">6</span></span>Strong art
thou, Agni, conquering, all-surpassing. Crush down  
   our foemen, ruin those who hate us.  
  So let this measure, measured, being measured, make all our kin  
   thy tributary vassals.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100107">7</span></span>Increase
with kinsmen and with all abundance: to mighty strength  
   and power lift up this woman.  
  Erect, rise upward to the sky's high station, rise to the lofty  
   world which men call Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100108">8</span></span>May this
great Earth receive the skin, this Goddess Prithivī,  
   showing us her love and favour. Then may we go unto the  
   world of virtue. <span id="page_42">p. 42</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100109">9</span></span>Fix on the
skin these two joined press-stones, duly rending the  
   fibres for the sacrificer.  
  Strike down and slay those who assail this woman, and elevating  
   raise on high her offspring.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100110">10</span></span>Grasp with
thy hand, O man, the well-formed press-stones: the  
   holy Gods have come unto thy worship.  
  Three wishes of thy heart which thou electest, these happy gains  
   for thee I here make ready.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100111">11</span></span>Here thy
devotion is, here is thy birthplace. Aditi, Mother of  
   brave sons, accept thee!  
  Wipe away those who fight against this woman with wealth and  
   store of goodly sons endow her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100112">12</span></span>Rest in the
roaring frame of wood: be parted from husk and  
   chaff, ye Sacrificial Fibres.  
  May we surpass in glory all our rivals. I cast beneath my feet  
   the men who hate us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100113">13</span></span>Go, Dame,
and quickly come again: the waters, enclosed, have  
   mounted thee that thou mayst bear them.  
  Take thou of these such as are fit for service: skilfully
separating.  
   leave the others.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100114">14</span></span>Hither
these Dames have come in radiant beauty. Arise and seize=  
   upon thy strength, O woman.  
  To thee hath sacrifice come: take the pitcher, blest with a good  
   lord, children, children's children.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100115">15</span></span>Instructed
by the Rishis, bring those waters, the share of strength  
   which was of old assigned you.  
  Let this effectual sacrifice afford you protection, fortune, off-  
   spring, men, and cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100116">16</span></span>Agni, on
thee the sacrificial caldron hath mounted: shining,.  
   fiercely flaming, heat it.  
  May hottest flames, divine, sprung from the Rishis, gathering,  
   with the Seasons, heat this portion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100117">17</span></span>Purified,
bright, and holy, let these Women, these lucid waters  
   glide into the caldron.  
  Cattle and many children may they give us. May he who cooks.  
   the Odana go to heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100118">18</span></span>Ye,
Sacrificial Rice and Soma Fibres, cleansed and made pure by  
   prayer and molten butter. <span id="page_43">p. 43</span>  
  Enter the water: let the caldron take you. May he who dresses  
   this ascend to heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100119">19</span></span>Expand
thyself abroad in all thy greatness, with thousand Prish-  
   thas, in the world of virtue.  
  Grandfathers, fathers, children, and descendants, fifteenth am I  
   to thee when I have dressed it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100120">20</span></span>With
thousand streams and Prishthas, undecaying, Brahmaudana  
   is celestial, God-reaching.  
  Those I give up to thee with all their children. Force them to  
   tribute, but to me be gracious.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100121">21</span></span>Rise to the
altar: bless this dame with offspring. Promote this  
   woman; drive away the demons.  
  May we surpass in glory all our rivals. I cast beneath my feet the  
   men who hate us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100122">22</span></span>Approach
this woman here with store of cattle: together with  
   the deities come to meet her.  
  Let not a curse or imprecation reach thee: in thine own seat  
   shine forth exempt from sickness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100123">23</span></span>Fashioned
at first by Right, set by the spirit, this altar of Brahmau-  
   dana was appointed.  
  Place the pure boiler on it, woman! set thou therein the rice  
   mess of Celestial Beings.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100124">24</span></span>This second
hand of Aditi, this ladle which the Seven Rishis,  
   world-creators, fashioned.  
  May this scoop deftly pile upon the altar, therein, the members  
   of the rice-oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100125">25</span></span>Let the
dressed offering and divine Ones serve thee: creep from.  
   the fire again, own these as masters.  
  Made pure with Soma rest within the Brāhmans: let not thine  
   eaters, Rishis' sons, be injured.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100126">26</span></span>Give
understanding unto these, King Soma! all the good Brāh  
   mans who attend and serve thee.  
  Oft, in Brahmaudana, and well I call on: Rishis, their sons, and  
   those who sprang from Fervour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100127">27</span></span>Here I set
singly in the hands of Brāhmans these cleansed and.  
   purifie d and holy Women,  
  May Indra, Marut girt, grant me the blessing which as I sprinkle  
   you, my heart desireth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100128">28</span></span>Here is my
gold, a light immortal: ripened grain from the field  
   this Cow of Plenty give me! <span id="page_44">p. 44</span>  
  This wealth I place among the Brāhmans, making a path that  
   leads to heaven among the Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100129">29</span></span>Lay thou
the chaff in Agni Jātavedas: remove the husks and  
   drive them to a distance.  
  That, we have heard, that is the House-Lord's portion: we know  
   the share allotted to Destruction.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100130">30</span></span>Mark him
who toils and cooks and pours oblation: make this  
   man climb the path that leads to heaven,  
  That he may mount and reach life that is highest, ascending to  
   the loftiest vault above us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100131">31</span></span>Adhvaryu,
cleanse that face of the Supporter. Make room, well  
   knowing, for the molten butter.  
  Purify duly all the limbs with fatness. I make a path to heaven  
   amid the Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100132">32</span></span>Supporter,
send to those men fiends and battle, to all non-Brah-  
   mans who attend and serve thee.  
  Famous and foremost, with their great possessions, let not these  
   here, the Rishis sons, be injured.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100133">33</span></span>I set thee,
Odana, with Rishis' children: naught here belongs to  
   men not sprung from Rishis.  
  Let Agni my protector, all the Maruts, the Visve Devas guard  
   the cooked oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100134">34</span></span>May we
adore thee, Sacrifice that yieldeth an everlasting son,  
   cow, home of treasures,  
  Together with increasing store of riches, long life and immor-  
   tality of children.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100135">35</span></span>Thou art a
Bull that mounts to heaven: to Rishis and their off-  
   spring go.  
  Rest in the world of pious men: there is the place prepared for  
   us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100136">36</span></span>Level the
ways: go thitherward, O Agni. Make ready thou the  
  Godward-leading pathways.  
  By these our pious actions may we follow sacrifice dwelling in  
   the seven-rayed heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100137">37</span></span>May we
invested with that light go upward, ascending to the  
   sky's most lofty summit.  
  Wherewith the Gods, what time they had made ready  
  Brahmaudana, mounted to the world of virtue.
