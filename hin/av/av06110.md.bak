### HYMN CX

#### A benediction on a new-born child

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0611001">1</span></span>Yea,
ancient, meet for praise at sacrifices, ever and now thou  
   sittest down as Hotar.  
  And now, O Agni, make thy person friendly, and win felicity  
   for us by worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0611002">2</span></span>Neath
Jyaishthaghni and Yama's Two Releasers this child was  
   born: preserve him from uprooting.  
  He shall conduct him safe past all misfortunes to lengthened  
   life that lasts a hundred autumns.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0611003">3</span></span>Born on the
Tiger's day was he, a hero, the Constellations'  
   child, born brave and manly.  
  Let him not wound, when grown in strength, his father, nor  
   disregard his mother, her who bare him.
