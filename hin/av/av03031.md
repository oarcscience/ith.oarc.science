### HYMN XXXI

#### A charm for the recovery of one dangerously ill

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303101">1</span></span>May Gods
release from failing strength, thou Agni, from  
   malignity!  
  I free from every evil, from decline: I compass round with life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303102">2</span></span>May Pavamāna
free from harm, and Sakra from unrighteous  
   deed.  
  I free from every evil, from decline: I compass round with life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303103">3</span></span>Tame beasts
have parted from wild beasts, water and thirst have  
   gone apart  
  I free, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303104">4</span></span>Parted are
heaven and earth, and paths turned to each quarter  
   of the sky.  
  I free, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303105">5</span></span>Tvashtar
prepares the bridal of his daughter; then all this world  
   of life departs and leaves him.  
  I free, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303106">6</span></span>Agni
combines the vital airs. The moon is closely joined with  
   breath.  
  I free. etc. <span id="page_a103">p. a103</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303107">7</span></span>The Gods
have lifted up with breath the Sun whose might is  
   everywhere.  
  I free, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303108">8</span></span>Die not.
Live with the breath of those who make and who enjoy  
   long life.  
  I free, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303109">9</span></span>Die not.
Stay here. Breathe with the breath of those who draw  
   the vital air.  
  I free, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303110">10</span></span>Rise up
with life, conjoined with life. Up, with the sap of growing  
   plants!  
  I free, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303111">11</span></span>We as
immortal beings have arisen with Parjanya's rain,  
  I free from every evil, from decline: I compass round with life.
