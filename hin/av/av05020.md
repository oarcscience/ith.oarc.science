### HYMN XX

#### A hymn to the War-drum to secure victory

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502001">1</span></span>Formed out
of wood, compact with straps of leather, loud is the:  
  War-drum as he plays the hero.  
  Whetting thy voice and vanquishing opponents, roar at them  
   like a lion fain to conquer!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502002">2</span></span>The fastened
frame hath roared as 'twere a lion, like a bull bel-  
   lowing to meet the heifer.  
  Thou art a bull, thine enemies are weaklings: thine is the foe-  
   subduing strength of Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502003">3</span></span>Like a bull
marked by strength among the cattle, roar seeking  
   kine and gathering up the booty.  
  Pierce through our adversaries' heart with sorrow, and let our  
   routed foes desert their hamlets.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502004">4</span></span>Victorious
in the battle, loudly roaring, seizing what may be  
   seized, look all around thee.  
  Utter, O Drum, thy heavenly voice with triumph. Bring, as a  
   priest, our enemies' possessions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502005">5</span></span>Hearing the
Drum's far-reaching voice resounding, let the foe's  
   dame, waked by the roar, afflicted,  
  Grasping her son, run forward in her terror amid the conflict of  
   the deadly weapons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502006">6</span></span>Thou, first
of all, O Drum, thy voice shalt utter: over the ridge  
   of earth speak forth exultant.  
  Crunching with might the army of the foemen, declare thy  
   message pleasantly and clearly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502007">7</span></span>Loud be thy
roar between the earth and heaven. Swift let thy  
   sounds go forth in all directions.  
  Neigh at them, thunder, set in opposition, song-maker, good  
   ally that friends may conquer. <span id="page_a181">p. a181</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502008">8</span></span>He shall
send forth his voice whom art hath fashioned. Make  
   thou the weapons of our warriors bristle.  
  With Indra for ally call out our heroes, and with thy friends  
   scatter and chase the foemen  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502009">9</span></span>Resonant,
roaring, with thy powerful weapons, warning, and  
   heard by troops in many places,  
  Knowing all rules and winning us advantage, deal fame to many  
   where two kings are fighting.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502010">10</span></span>Bent on
advantage, mightier, gaining treasures, victor in war,  
   the spell hath made thee keener.  
  As, in the press, the stone to stalks of Soma, thus, Drum! go  
   dancing to our foes' possessions.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0502011">11</span></span>Foe-conqueror, victor, vanquishing
opponents, seeker of booty,  
   mastering, destroying.  
  Speak out as a skilled speaker tells his counsel, speak strength  
   to us that we may win the battle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502012">12</span></span>Shaker of
things unshaken, readiest corner to battles; conquer-  
   ing foes, resistless leader,  
  Guarded by Indra, watching our assemblies, go quickly, breaker  
   of their hearts who hate us.
