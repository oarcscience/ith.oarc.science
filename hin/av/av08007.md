### HYMN VII

#### A charm to restore a sick man to health

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800701">1</span></span>The
tawny-coloured, and the pale, the variegated and the red,  
  The dusky-tinted, and the black,—all Plants we summon hither-  
   ward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800702">2</span></span>This man let
them deliver from Consumption which the Gods  
   have sent.  
  The father of these Herbs was Heaven, their mother Earth, the  
  Sea their root.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800703">3</span></span>The Waters
are the best, and heavenly Plants.  
  From every limb of thine have they removed Consumption  
   caused by sin.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800704">4</span></span>I speak to
Healing Herbs spreading, and bushy, to creepers, and  
   to those whose sheath is single,  
  I call for thee the fibrous and the reed-like, and branching.  
  Plants, dear to the Visve Devas, powerful, giving life to men.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800705">5</span></span>The
conquering strength, the power and might which ye, victo-  
   rious Plants, possess,  
  Therewith deliver this man here from this Consumption, O ye  
  Plants: so I prepare the remedy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800706">6</span></span>The living
Plant that giveth life, that driveth malady away,  
  Arundhatr, the rescuer, strengthening, rich a sweets I call, to free  
   this man from scath and harm.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800707">7</span></span>Hitherward
let the sapient come, the friendly sharers o f my  
   speech. <span id="page_a341">p. a341</span>  
  That we may give this man relief and raise him from his evil  
   plight.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800708">8</span></span>Germ of the
Waters, Agni's food, Plants ever growing fresh and  
   new,  
  Sure, healing, bearing thousand names, let them be all collected  
   here.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800709">9</span></span>Let Plants
whose soul is water, girt with Avakās, piercing with  
   their sharp horns expel the malady.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800710">10</span></span>Strong,
antidotes of poison, those releasers, free from Varuna,  
  And those that drive away Catarrh, and those that frustrate  
   magic arts, let all those Plants come hitherward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800711">11</span></span>Let
purchased Plants of mightier power, Plants that are praised  
   for excellence.  
  Here in this village safely keep cattle and horses, man and beast.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800712">12</span></span>Sweet is
their root, sweet are these Plants' top branches, sweet  
   also is their intermediate portion;  
  Sweet is their foliage, and sweet their blossom, combined with  
   sweetness is their taste of Amrit: food, fatness let them yield,  
   with kine preceding.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800713">13</span></span>These
Plants that grow upon the earth, whate'er their number  
   and their size,  
  Let these with all their thousand leaves free me from Death and  
   misery.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800714">14</span></span>May the
Plants' Tiger-amulet, protective, guardian from the  
   curse,  
  Beat off the brood of demons, drive all maladies afar from us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800715">15</span></span>Before the
gathered Plants they fly and scatter, as though a lion's  
   roar or fire dismayed them.  
  Expelled by Plants, let men's and kine's Consumption pass from  
   us to the navigable rivers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800716">16</span></span>Emancipated
from the sway of Agni, of Vaisvānara, go, covering  
   the earth, ye Plants whose ruler is Vanaspati.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800717">17</span></span>May these
be pleasant to our heart, auspicious, rich in store of  
   milk,  
  These Plants of the Angirases which grow on mountains and on  
   plains.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800718">18</span></span>The Plants
I know myself, the plants that with mine eye I look  
   upon,  
  Plants yet unknown, and those we know, wherein we find that  
   power is stored, <span id="page_a342">p. a342</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800719">19</span></span>Let all the
congregated Plants attend and mark mine utterance,  
  That we may rescue this man here and save him from severe  
   distress.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800720">20</span></span>Asvattha,
Darbha, King of Plants, is Soma, deathless sacrifice  
  Barley and Rice are healing balms, the sons of Heaven who  
   never die.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800721">21</span></span>Lift
yourselves up, ye Healing Plants, loud is the thunder's crash  
   and roar.  
  When with full flow Parjanya, ye Children of Prisni! blesseth;  
   you.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800722">22</span></span>We give the
essence of that stream of nectar of this man to  
   drink:  
  So I prepare a remedy that he may live a hundred years.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800723">23</span></span>Well doth
the wild boar know a Plant, the mungoose knows the  
  Healing Herb.  
  I call, to aid this man, the Plants which Serpents and Gandhar-  
   vas know.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800724">24</span></span>Plants of
Angirases which hawks, celestial Plants which eagles.  
   know;  
  Plants known to swans and lesser fowl, Plants known to all the  
   birds that fly.  
  Plants that are known to sylvan beasts,—I call them all to aid  
   this man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800725">25</span></span>The
multitude of herbs whereon the Cows whom none may  
   slaughter feed, all that are food for goats and sheep,  
  So many Plants, brought hitherward, give shelter and defence to  
   thee!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800726">26</span></span>Hitherward
unto thee I bring the Plants that cure all maladies,  
  All Plants wherein physicians have discovered health-bestowing  
   power.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800727">27</span></span>Let Plants
with flower and Plants with bud, the fruitful and the  
   fruitless, all,  
  Like children of one mother, yield their stores for this man's  
   perfeet health.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800728">28</span></span>From the
Five-arrowed, from the Ten-arrowed have I delivered  
   thee,  
  Freed thee from Yama's fetter and from all offence against the  
  Gods,
