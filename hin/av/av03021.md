### HYMN XXI

#### In honour of fire in all shapes, to appease Agni of the funeral pile and to quench the flames of cremation

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302101">1</span></span>All Fires
that are in water and in Vritra, all those that man and  
   stones contain within them,  
  That which hath entered herbs and trees and bushes—to all  
   these Fires be this oblation offered.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302102">2</span></span>That which
abides in Soma and in cattle, that which lies deep in  
   birds and sylvan creatures,  
  That which hath entered quadrupeds and bipeds—to all these  
  Fires be this oblation offered.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302103">3</span></span>The Fire
that rideth by the side of Indra, the God Vaisvānara,.  
   yea all-consuming,  
  Whom, as the victor, I invoke in battles—to all these Fires be  
   this oblation offered.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302104">4</span></span>The
all-devouring God whom men call Kāma, he whom they  
   call the Giver and Receiver,  
  Invincible, pervading, wise, and mighty—to all these Fires be  
   this oblation offered.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302105">5</span></span>To thee,
strength-giver, glorious, rich in pleasant strains, whom.  
   in their minds the thirteen creatures of the world,  
  And the five sons of man regard as Hotar-priest—to all these-  
  Fires be this oblation offered. <span id="page_a92">p. a92</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302106">6</span></span>To him who
feeds on ox and cow, sage, bearing Soma on his  
   back,  
  To all Vaisvānara's followers—to these be this oblation paid.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302107">7</span></span>All fiery
flames that follow after lightning, flashing o'er earth,  
   through firmament and heaven,  
  All that are in the wind and skyey regions—to all these Fires be  
   this oblation offered.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302108">8</span></span>The
golden-handed Savitar and Indra, Brihaspati, Varuna,  
  Mitra, and Agni,  
  The Angirases we call, the Visve Devas: let them appease this  
  Agni, Flesh-devourer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302109">9</span></span>Flesh-eating
Agni is appeased, appeased is he who hurteth men.  
  Now him who burneth every thing, the Flesh-consumer, have I  
   stilled.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302110">10</span></span>The
mountains where the Soma grows, the waters lying calm and  
   still,  
  Vāta, Parjanya, Agni's self have made the Flesh-consumer rest.
