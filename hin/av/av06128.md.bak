#### A charm for fair weather

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0612801">1</span></span>What time
the heavenly bodies chose the Weather Prophet as  
   their King,  
  They brought him favouring weather, and, Let this be his do-  
   main, they said.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0612802">2</span></span>May we have
weather fair at noon, May we have weather fair  
   at eve,  
  Fair weather when the morning breaks, fair weather when the  
   night is come.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0612803">3</span></span>Fair weather
to the day and night, and to the stars and sun and  
   moon.  
  Give favourable weather thou, King, Weather Prophet, unto us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0612804">4</span></span>Be worship
ever paid to thee, O Weather Prophet, King of  
  Star s,  
  Who gavest us oo weather in the evening and by night and  
   day!
