### HYMN III

#### A prayer to Agni, Indra, and other deities for victory and prosperity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500301">1</span></span>Let strength
be mine while I invoke thee, Agni! enkindling thee  
   may we support our bodies.  
  May the four regions bend and bow before me: with thee for  
   guardian may we win the combat.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500302">2</span></span>Baffling the
range of our opponents, Agni! guard us as our  
   protector round about us.  
  Down the steep slope go they who hate us, backward, and let  
   their thought who watch at home be ruined.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500303">3</span></span>May all the
Gods be on my side in battle, the Maruts led by  
  Indra, Vishnu, Agni.  
  Mine be the middle air's extended region, and may the Wind  
   blow favouring these my wishes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500304">4</span></span>For me let
them present all mine oblations, and let my mind's  
   intention be accomplished.  
  May I be guiltless of the least transgression: may all the Gods  
   come hither and protect me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500305">5</span></span>May the Gods
grant me riches, may the blessing and invocation  
   of the Gods assist me.  
  This boon shall the celestial Hotars win us: may we, unwound-  
   ed, have brave heroes round us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500306">6</span></span>Ye six
divine Expanses, give us freedom. Here, all ye Gods,  
   acquit yourselves like heroes.  
  Let not calamity or curse o'ertake us, nor deeds of wickedness  
   that merit hatred.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500307">7</span></span>Do ye three
Goddesses give ample shelter and all success to us  
   ourselves and children.  
  Let us not lose our children or our bodies: let us not benefit  
   the foe, King Soma!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500308">8</span></span>Foodful and
much-invoked, at this our calling may the far-  
   reaching Bull grant us wide shelter.  
  Lord of bay coursers, Indra, bless our children: harm us not,  
   give us not as prey to others.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500309">9</span></span>Lord of the
world, Creator and Disposer, may the God Savitar  
   who quells assailants,  
  May the Ādityas, Rudras, both the Asvins, Gods, guard the  
   sacrificer from destruction.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500310">10</span></span>Let those
who are our foemen stay afar from us: with Indra  
   and with Agni we will drive them off. <span id="page_a158">p.
a158</span>  
  The Ādityas and the Rudras, over us on high, have made me  
   strong, a thinker, and a sovran lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500311">11</span></span>Yea, we
call Indra hitherward, the winner of wealth in battle  
   and of kine and horses.  
  May he mark this our worship when we call him, Lord of bay  
   steeds, thou art our friend and comrade.
