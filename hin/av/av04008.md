### HYMN VIII

#### A benediction at the consecration of a King

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400801">1</span></span>The Being
lays the sap of life in beings: he hath become the  
   sovran Lord of creatures.  
  Death comes to this man's royal consecration: let him as King  
   own and allow this kingdom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400802">2</span></span>Come
forward, turn not back in scorn, strong guardian, slayer  
   of the foes.  
  Approach, O gladdener of thy friends. The Gods have blessed  
   and strengthened thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400803">3</span></span>All waited
on him as he came to meet them. He self-resplendent  
   moves endued with glory.  
  That is the royal hero's lofty nature: he, manifold, hath gained  
   immortal powers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400804">4</span></span>Stride forth
to heaven's broad regions, thou, a tiger on a tiger's  
   skin.  
  Let all the people long for thee. Let heavenly floods be rich in  
   milk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400805">5</span></span>Heaven's
waters joyous in their milk, the waters of middle air,  
   and those that earth containeth-  
  I with the gathered power and might of all these waters sprinkle  
   thee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400806">6</span></span>The heavenly
waters rich in milk have sprinkled thee with power  
   and might.  
  To be the gladdener of thy friends. May Savitar so fashion thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400807">7</span></span>These,
compassing the tiger, rouse the lion to great joy and  
   bliss. <span id="page_a113">p. a113</span>  
  As strong floods purify the standing ocean, so men adorn the  
   leopard in the waters
