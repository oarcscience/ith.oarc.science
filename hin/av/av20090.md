### HYMN XC

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009001">1</span></span>Served with
oblations, first-born, mountain-render, Angiras' Son,  
  Brihaspati the holy.  
  With twice-firm path, dwelling in light, our Father, roars loudly,  
   as a bull, to earth and heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009002">2</span></span>Brihaspati
who made for such a people wide room and verge  
   when Gods were invocated—  
  Slaying his foe he breaketh down their cattles, quelling his  
   enemies and those who hate him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009003">3</span></span>Brihaspati
in war hath won rich treasures, hath won, this God,  
   the great stalls filled with cattle.  
  Striving to win waters and light, resistless, Brihaspati with light-  
   ning smites the foeman.
