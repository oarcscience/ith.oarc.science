### HYMN I

#### A glorification of the Asvins' whip and a prayer for blessings

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900101">1</span></span>The Asvins'
Honey-whip was born from heaven and earth, from  
   middle air, and ocean, and from fire and wind.  
  All living creatures welcome it with joyful hearts, fraught with  
   the store of Amrit it hath gathered up.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900102">2</span></span>They call
thee earth's great strength in every form, they call  
   thee too the ocean's genial seed.  
  Whence comes the Honey-whip bestowing bounty, there Vital  
  Spirit is, and Amrit treasured.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900103">3</span></span>In sundry
spots, repeatedly reflecting, men view upon the earth:  
   her course and action;  
  For she, the first-born daughter of the Maruts, derives her  
   origin from Wind and Agni.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900104">4</span></span>Daughter of
Vasus, mother of Ādityas, centre of Amrit breath  
   of living creatures.  
  The Honey-whip, gold-coloured, dropping fatness, moves as a  
   mighty embryo 'mid mortals.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900105">5</span></span>The deities
begat the Whip of Honey: her embryo assumed all  
   forms and fashions.  
  The mother nourishes that tender infant which at its birth  
   looks on all worlds and beings.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900106">6</span></span>Who
understandeth well, who hath perceived it, her heart's un-  
   injured Soma-holding beaker?  
  Let the wise Brāhman priest therein be joyful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900107">7</span></span>He
understandeth them, he hath perceived them, her breasts  
   that pour a thousand streams, uninjured.  
  They unreluctantly yield strength and vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900108">8</span></span>She who with
voice upraised in constant clamour, mighty, life-  
   giving, goes unto her function,  
  Bellowing to the heated three libations, suckles with streams of  
   milk, and still is lowing. <span id="page_a357">p. a357</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900109">9</span></span>On whom,
well-fed, the Waters wait in worship, and steers and  
   self-refulgent bulls attend her.  
  For thee, for one like thee down pour the Waters, and cause  
   desire and strength to rain upon thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900110">10</span></span>The thunder
is thy voice, O Lord of Creatures: a Bull, thou  
   castest on the earth thy vigour.  
  The Honey-whip, the Manus' first-born daughter, derives her  
   origin from Wind and Agni.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900111">11</span></span>As at the
morning sacrifice the Asvins twain love Soma well,  
  Even so may both the Asvins lay splendour and strength within  
   my soul.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900112">12</span></span>As at the
second sacrifice Indra and Agni love him well,  
  Let the pair, Indra Agni, lay splendour and strength within my  
   soul.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900113">13</span></span>As at third
sacrifice Soma is the Ribhus' well-beloved one,  
  Even so may they, the Ribhus, store splendour and strength  
   within my soul.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900114">14</span></span>Fain would
I bring forth sweetness, fain would make it mine.  
  Bringing milk, Agni! have I come: splendour and strength  
   bestow on me!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900115">15</span></span>Grant me, O
Agni, splendid strength, and progeny, and length-  
   ened life.  
  May the Gods know me as I am, may Indra with the Rishis  
   know.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900116">16</span></span>As
honey-bees collect and add fresh honey to their honey store,  
  Even so may both the Asvins lay splendour and strength within  
   my soul.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900117">17</span></span>As over
honey flies besmear this honey which the bees have  
   made,  
  So may both Asvins lay in me splendour and strength and  
   power and might.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900118">18</span></span>May all the
sweetness that is found in hills and mountains,  
   steeds and kine,  
  And wine that floweth from the cup,—may all that sweetness  
   be in me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900119">19</span></span>May both
the Asvins, Lords of Light, balm me with honey of  
   the bees,  
  That I may speak among the folk words full of splendour and  
   of strength. <span id="page_a358">p. a358</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900120">20</span></span>The thunder
is thy voice, O Lord of Creatures: a Bull, thou  
   castest strength on earth and heaven.  
  To that all cattle look for their existence: with this she nourishes  
   their force and vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900121">21</span></span>The Whip
itself is Heaven, Earth is the handle, the point of  
   juncture is the Air's mid-region.  
  The lash is lightning, and the tip is golden.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900122">22</span></span>Whoever
knows the Whip's seven kinds of honey, becomes  
   himself a man endowed with sweetness.  
  Brāhman and King, the draught-ox and the milch-cow, barley  
   and rice, and honey is the seventh.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900123">23</span></span>Sweet is
the man, sweet are his goods and chattels: he who  
   knows this conquers the worlds of sweetness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900124">24</span></span>The
thundering of Prajāpati in heaven is verily manifest to living  
   creatures.  
  Therefore I stand from right to left invested, and, O Prajāpati,  
  I cry, regard me!  
  The man who hath this knowledge is regarded by living beings  
   and the Lord of Creatures.
