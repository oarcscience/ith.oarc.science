### HYMN CXXXV

#### Verses called Frustration, Abuse, the Gods' Offering, and Dazzling Power

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013501">1</span></span>Bang! here
he is. A dog,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013502">2</span></span>Swish! it is
gone. Falling of leaves.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013503">3</span></span>Crunch! it
is trodden on. A cow's hoof.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013504">4</span></span>These Gods
have gone astray. Do thou, Adhvaryu, quickly do  
   thy work.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013505">5</span></span>There is
good resting for the cows. Take thy delight.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013506">6</span></span>O singer,
the Ādityas brought rich guerdon to the Angirases.  
  Singer, they went not near to it. Singer, they did not take the  
   gift.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013507">7</span></span>Singer, they
went not near to that; but, singer, they accepted  
   this:  
  That days may not be indistinct, nor sacrifices leaderless. <span
id="page_372">p. 372</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013508">8</span></span>And quickly
Both he fly away, the White Horse swiftest on his  
   feet,  
  And swiftly fills his measure up.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013509">9</span></span>Ādityas,
Rudras, Vasus, all pay worship unto thee. Accept this  
   liberal gift, O Angiras,  
  This bounty excellent and rich, this ample bounty spreading far.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013510">10</span></span>The Gods
shall give the precious boon: let it be pleasant to  
   your hearts.  
  Let it be with you every day: accept our offerings in return.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013511">11</span></span>Vouchsafe
us shelter, Indra, thou to be invoked from far away.  
  Bring treasure hither to reward the far-famed bard who praises  
   thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013512">12</span></span>Thou,
Indra, to the trembling dove whose pinions had been rent  
   and torn.  
  Gayest ripe grain and Pilu fruit, gavest him water when athirst.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013513">13</span></span>The ready
praiser loudly speaks though fastened triply with a  
   strap.  
  Yea, he commends the freshening draught, deprecates languor  
   of disease.
