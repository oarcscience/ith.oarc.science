### HYMN II

#### A glorification of Kāma as God of desire of all that is good

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900201">1</span></span>Kāma the
Bull, slayer of foes, I worship with molten butter,  
   sacrifice, oblation.  
  Beneath my feet cast down mine adversaries with thy great  
   manly power, when I have praised thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900202">2</span></span>That which
is hateful to mine eye and spirit, that harasses and  
   robs me of enjoyment,  
  The evil dream I loose upon my foemen. May I rend him when  
  I have lauded Kāma.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900203">3</span></span>Kāma, do
thou, a mighty Lord and Ruler, let loose ill dream,  
   misfortune, want of children,  
  Homelessness, Kāma! utter destitution, upon the sinner who  
   designs my ruin.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900204">4</span></span>Drive them
away, drive them afar, O Kāma; indigence fall on  
   those who are my foemen!  
  When they have been cast down to deepest darkness, consume  
   their dwellings with thy fire, O Agni.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900205">5</span></span>She, Kāma!
she is called the Cow, thy daughter, she who is  
   named Vāk and Virāj by sages.  
  By her drive thou my foemen to a distance. May cattle, vital  
   breath, and life forsake them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900206">6</span></span>By Kāma's
might, King Varuna's and Indra's, by Vishnu's  
   strength, and Savitar's instigation,  
  I chase my foes with sacrifice to Agni, as a deft steersman drives  
   his boat through waters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900207">7</span></span>May Kāma,
mighty one, my potent warder, give me full free-  
   dom from mine adversaries.  
  May all the Deities be my protection, all Gods come nigh to  
   this mine invocation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900208">8</span></span>Accepting
this oblation rich with fatness, be joyful here, ye  
  Gods whose chief is Kāma,  
  Giving me freedom from mine adversaries.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900209">9</span></span>Ye, Indra,
Agni, Kāma! come together and cast mine adver-  
   saries down beneath me.  
  When they have sunk into the deepest darkness, O Agni, with  
   thy fire consume their dwellings. <span id="page_a360">p.
a360</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900210">10</span></span>Slay those
who are mine enemies, O Kāma: headlong to depth  
   of blinding darkness hurl them.  
  Reft be they all of manly strength and vigour! Let them not  
   have a single day's existence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900211">11</span></span>Kāma hath
slain those who were mine opponents, and given me  
   ample room to grow and prosper.  
  Let the four regions bow them down before me, and let the  
   six expanses bring me fatness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900212">12</span></span>Let them
drift downward like a boat torn from the rope that  
   held it fast.  
  There is no turning back for those whom our keen arrows have  
   repelled.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900213">13</span></span>Agni
averts, Indra averts, and Soma: may the averting Gods  
   avert this foeman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900214">14</span></span>To be
avoided by his friends, detested, repelled, with few men  
   round him, let him wander.  
  Yea, on the earth descend the lightning-flashes: may the strong  
  God destroy your adversaries.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900215">15</span></span>This potent
lightning nourishes things shaken, and things un-  
   shaken yet, and all the thunders.  
  May the Sun, rising with his wealth and splendour, drive in  
   victorious might my foemen downward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900216">16</span></span>Thy firm
and triply-barred protection, Kāma! thy spell, made  
   weapon-proof extended armour  
  With that drive thou my foemen to a distance. May cattle, vital  
   breath, and life forsake them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900217">17</span></span>Far from
the world wherein we live, O Kāma, drive thou my  
   foemen with that selfsame weapon  
  Wherewith the Gods repelled the fiends, and Indra cast down  
   the Dasyus into deepest darkness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900218">18</span></span>As Gods
repelled the Asuras, and Indra down to the lowest  
   darkness drove the demons,  
  So, Kāma, from this world, to distant places, drive thou the  
   men who are mine adversaries.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900219">19</span></span>First
before all sprang Kāma into being. Gods, Fathers, mortal  
   men have never matched him.  
  Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee,  
   to thee I offer worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900220">20</span></span>Wide as the
space which heaven and earth encompass, far as  
   the flow of waters, far as Agni, <span id="page_a361">p.
a361</span>  
  Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee,  
   to thee I offer worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900221">21</span></span>Vast as the
quarters of the sky and regions that lie between  
   them spread in all directions, vast as celestial tracts and views  
   of heaven,  
  Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee,  
   to thee I offer worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900222">22</span></span>Many as are
the bees, and bats, and reptiles, and female serpents  
   of the trees, and beetles,  
  Stronger art thou than these, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee,  
   to thee I offer worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900223">23</span></span>Stronger
art thou than aught that stands or twinkles, stronger  
   art thou than ocean, Kāma! Manyu!  
  Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee,  
   to thee I offer worship.  
 <span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900224">24</span></span>Not even
Vāta is the peer of Kāma, not Agni, Chandramas  
   the Moon, nor Sūrya.  
  Stronger than these art thou, and great for ever. Kāma, to thee,  
   to thee I offer worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900225">25</span></span>Thy lovely
and auspicious forms, O Kāma, whereby the thing  
   thou wilt becometh real,  
  With these come thou and make thy home among us, and make  
   malignant thoughts inhabit elsewhere.
