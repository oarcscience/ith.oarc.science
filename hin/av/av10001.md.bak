### HYMN I

#### A charm against witchcraft

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000101">1</span></span>Afar let her
depart: away we drive her whom, made with hands,  
   all-beautiful,  
  Skilled men prepare and fashion like a bride amid her nuptial  
   train.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000102">2</span></span>Complete,
with head and nose and ears, all-beauteous, wrought  
   with magic skill  
  Afar let her depart: away we drive her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000103">3</span></span>Made by a
Sidra or a Prince, by priests or women let her go.  
  Back to her maker as her kin, like a dame banished by her lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000104">4</span></span>I with this
salutary herb have ruined all their magic arts,  
  The spell which they have cast upon thy field, thy cattle, or thy  
   men.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000105">5</span></span>Ill fall on
him who doeth ill, on him who curseth fall the  
   curse!  
  We drive her back that she may slay the man who wrought the  
   witchery.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000106">6</span></span>Against her
comes the Angirasa, the Priest whose eye is over us.  
  Turn back all witcheries and slay those practisers of magic arts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000107">7</span></span>Whoever said
to thee, Go forth against the foeman up the  
   stream,  
  To him, O Krityā, go thou back. Pursue not us, the sinless  
   ones.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000108">8</span></span>He who
composed thy limbs with thought as a deft joiner builds  
   a car,  
  Go to him: thither lies thy way. This man is all unknown to  
   thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000109">9</span></span>The cunning
men, the sorcerers who fashioned thee and held thee  
   fast,— <span id="page_2">p. 2</span>  
  This cures and mars their witchery, this, repellent, drives it back  
   the way it came. With this we make thee swim.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000110">10</span></span>When we
have found her ducked and drenched, a hapless cow  
   whose calf hath died,  
  Let all my woe depart and let abundant riches come to me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000111">11</span></span>If, as they
gave thy parents aught, they named thee, or at sacri-  
   fice,  
  From all their purposed evil let these healing herbs deliver thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000112">12</span></span>From
mention of thy name, from sin against the Fathers or the  
  Gods,  
  These herbs of healing shall by prayer release thee, by power,  
   by holy texts, the milk of .Rishis.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000113">13</span></span>As the wind
stirs the dust from earth and drives the rain cloud  
   from the sky,  
  So, chased and banished by the spell, all misery departs from  
   me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000114">14</span></span>Go with a
resonant cry, depart, like a she-ass whose cords are  
   loosed.  
  Go to thy makers: hence! away! Go driven by the potent  
   spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000115">15</span></span>This,
Krityā, is thy path, we say, and guide thee. We drive thee  
   back who hast been sent against us.  
  Go by this pathway, breaking loose for onslaught even as a host  
   complete with cars and horses.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000116">16</span></span>No path
leads hitherward for thee to travel. Turn thee from us:  
   far off, thy light is yonder.  
  Fly hence across the ninety floods, the rivers most hard to pass.  
  Begone, and be not wounded.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000117">17</span></span>As wind the
trees, so smite and overthrow them: leave not cow,  
   horse, or man of them surviving  
  Return, O Krityā, unto those who made thee. Wake them from  
   sleep to find that they are childless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000118">18</span></span>The charm
or secret power which they have buried for thee in  
   sacred grass, field, cemetery,  
  Or spell in household fire which men more cunning have  
   wrought against thee innocent and simple,—  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000119">19</span></span>That tool
of hatred, understood, made ready, stealthy and buried  
   deep, have we discovered, <span id="page_3">p. 3</span>  
  Let that go back to whence it came, turn thither like a horse  
   and kill the children of the sorcerer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000120">20</span></span>Within our
house are swords of goodly iron. Krityā, we know  
   thy joints and all their places.  
  Arise this instant and begone! What, stranger! art thou seek-  
   ing here?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000121">21</span></span>O Krityā, I
will cut thy throat and hew thy feet off. Run, be-  
   gone!  
  Indra and Agni, Guardian Lords of living creatures, shield us  
   well!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000122">22</span></span>May Soma,
gracious friend, imperial Sovran, and the world's  
  Masters look on us with favour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000123">23</span></span>Bhava and
Sarva cast the flash of lightning, the weapon of the  
  Gods, against the sinner who made the evil thing, who deals  
   in witchcraft!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000124">24</span></span>If thou
hast come two-footed or four-footed, made by the  
   sorcerer, wrought in perfect beauty,  
  Become eight-footed and go hence. Speed back again, thou evil  
   one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000125">25</span></span>Anointed,
balmed, and well adorned, bearing all trouble with  
   thee, go.  
  Even as a daughter knows her sire, so know thy marker, Krityā,  
   thou.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000126">26</span></span>Krityā,
begone, stay not. Pursue as 'twere the wounded crea-  
   ture's track.  
  He is the chase, the hunter thou he may not slight or humble thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000127">27</span></span>He waits,
and aiming with his shaft smites him who first would  
   shoot at him,  
  And, when the foeman deals a blow before him, following strikes  
   him down.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000128">28</span></span>Hearken to
this my word; then go thither away whence thou  
   hast come; to him who made thee go thou back.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000129">29</span></span>The
slaughter of an innocent, O Krityā, is an awful deed. Slay  
   not cow, horse, or man of ours.  
  In whatsoever place thou art concealed we rouse thee up there-  
   from: become thou lighter than a leaf.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000130">30</span></span>If ye be
girt about with clouds of darkness, bound as with a  
   net.  
  We rend and tear all witcheries hence and to their maker send  
   them back. <span id="page_4">p. 4</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000131">31</span></span>The brood
of wizard, sorcerer, the purposer of evil deed.  
  Crush thou, O Krityā spare not, kill those practisers of magic  
   arts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000132">32</span></span>As Sūrya
frees himself from depth of darkness, and casts away  
   the night and rays of morning,  
  So I repel each baleful charm which an enchanter hath pre-  
   pared;  
  And, as an elephant shakes off the dust, I cast the plague aside.
