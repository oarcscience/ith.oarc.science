### HYMN XII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001201">1</span></span>Prayers have
been offered up through love of glory: Vasishtha,  
   honour Indra in the battle.  
  He who with might extends through all existence hears words  
   which I, his faithful servant, utter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001202">2</span></span>A cry was
raised which reached the Gods, O Indra, a cry to  
   them to send us strength in combat.  
  None among men knows his own life's duration: bear us in  
   safety over these our troubles.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001203">3</span></span>The Bays,
the booty-seeking car I harness: my prayers have  
   reached him who accepts them gladly.  
  Indra, when he had slain resistless Vritras, forced with his might  
   the two world-halves asunder.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001204">4</span></span>Like barren
cows, moreover, swelled the waters: the singers  
   sought thy holy rite, O Indra.  
  Come unto us as with his team comes Vāyu: thou, through our  
   solemn hymns, bestowest booty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001205">5</span></span>So may these
gladdening draughts rejoice thee, Indra, the Mighty,  
   very bounteous to the singer.  
  Alone among the Gods thou pitiest mortals: O Hero, make thee  
   glad at this libation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001206">6</span></span>Thus the
Vasishthas glorify with praises Indra, the Mighty One,  
   whose arm wields thunder.  
  Praised, may he guard our wealth in kine and heroes. Ye Gods,.  
   preserve us evermore with blessings.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001207">7</span></span>Impetuous,
Thunderer, strong, quelling the mighty, King, potent,  
  Vritra-slayer, Soma-drinker,  
  May he come hither with his yoked bay horses. May Indra glad-  
   den him at noon libation.
