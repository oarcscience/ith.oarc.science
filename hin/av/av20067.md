### HYMN LXVII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006701">1</span></span>The pourer
of oblations gains the home of wealth pouring his  
   gift conciliates hostilities, yea, the hostilities of Gods.  
  Pouring he strives, unchecked and strong, to win him riches  
   thousandfold.  
  Indra gives lasting wealth to him who pours forth gifts; yea,  
   wealth he gives that long shall last.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006702">2</span></span>Ne'er may
those manly deeds of yours for us grow old, never  
   may your bright glories fall into decay, never before your  
   time decay. <span id="page_317">p. 317</span>  
  What deed of yours, new every age, wondrous, surpassing man,.  
   rings forth,  
  Whatever, Maruts may be difficult to gain grant us whate'er is  
   hard to win.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006703">3</span></span>I think on
Agni, Hotar, the munificent, the gracious Son of  
   strength, who knoweth all that live, as holy Sage who knoweth  
   all.  
  Lord of fair rites, a God with form erected turning to the Gods.  
  He, when the flame hath sprung forth from the holy oil, the  
   offered fatness, longeth for it with his glow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006704">4</span></span>Busied with
sacrifice, with spotted deer and spears, gleaming.  
   upon your way with ornaments, yea, our friends,  
  Sitting on sacred grass, ye sons of Bharata, drink Soma from  
   the Potar's bowl, O Men of heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006705">5</span></span>Bring the
Gods hither, Sage, and offer sacrifice. At the three  
   altars seat thee willingly .O Priest.  
  Accept for thy delight the proffered Soma mead: drink from  
   the Kindler's bowl and sate thee with thy share.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006706">6</span></span>This is the
strengthener of thy body's manly might: strength,.  
   victory for all time are laid within thine arms.  
  Pressed for thee, Maghavan, it is offered unto thee: drink from  
   the chalice of this Brāhman, drink thy fill.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006707">7</span></span>Him whom of
old I called on, him I call on now. He is to be  
   invoked: his name is He who Gives.  
  Here brought by priests in Soma mead. Granter of Wealth,  
   drink Soma with the Seasons from the Hotar's Cup.
