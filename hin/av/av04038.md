### HYMN XXXVIII

#### A charm for success in gambling

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403801">1</span></span>Hither I
call the Apsaras, victorious, who plays with skill,  
  Her who comes freely fort to view, who wins the stakes in games  
   of dice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403802">2</span></span>Hither I
call that Apsaras who scatters and who gathers up. <span
id="page_a149">p. a149</span>  
  The Apsaras who plays with skill and takes her winnings in the  
   game.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403803">3</span></span>Dancing
around us with the dice, winning the wager by her  
   play.  
  May she obtain the stake for us and gain the victory with skill.  
  May she approach us full of strength: let them not win this  
   wealth of ours.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403804">4</span></span>Hither I
call that Apsaras, the joyous, the delightful one—  
  Those nymphs who revel in the dice, who suffer grief and yield  
   to wrath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403805">5</span></span>Who follow
in their course the rays of Sūrya, or as a particle of  
   light attend him.  
  Whose leader from afar, with store of riches, compasses quickly  
   all the worlds and guards them.  
  Pleased, may he come to this our burnt oblation, together with  
   the Air, enriched with treasure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403806">6</span></span>Together
with the Air, O rich in treasure, guard here the white  
   cow and the calf, O mighty!  
  Here are abundant drops for thee, come hither! Here is thy  
   white calf, let thy mind be with us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403807">7</span></span>Together
with the Air, O rich in treasure, keep the white calf in  
   safety here, O mighty!  
  Here is the grass, here is the stall, here do we bind the calf. We  
   are your masters, name by name. All Hail!
