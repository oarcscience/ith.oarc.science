### HYMN V

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500501">1</span></span>For him they
made the Archer Bhava a deliverer from the inter-  
   mediate space of the eastern region. Bhava the Archer, a  
   deliverer, delivers him from the intermediate space of the  
   eastern region. Neither Sarva nor Bhava nor Isāna slays him  
   who possesses this knowledge, or his cattle, or his kinsmen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500502">2</span></span>They made
Sarva the Archer his deliverer from the intermediate  
   space of the southern region, etc, as in verse 1.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500503">3</span></span>They made
Pasupati the Archer his deliverer from the inter-  
   mediate space of the western region, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500504">4</span></span>They made
the Awful God, the Archer, his deliverer from the  
   intermediate space of the northern region, etc, as above.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500505">5</span></span>They made

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500507">7</span></span>They made
Isana the Archer his deliverer from all the inter-  
   mediate regions. Isāna the Archer, a deliverer, delivers him  
   from all the intermediate regions. Neither Sarva nor Bhava,  
   nor Isana slays him who possesses this knowledge, or his cattle,  
   or his kinsmen.
