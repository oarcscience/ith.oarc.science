### HYMN XIX

#### A glorification of the office of a king's household priest

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301901">1</span></span>Quickened is
this my priest rank, quickened is manly strength  
   and force,  
  Quickened be changeless power, whereof I am the conquering  
  President!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301902">2</span></span>I quicken
these men's princely sway, the might, the manly  
   strength and force;  
  I rend away the foemen's arms with this presented sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301903">3</span></span>Down fall
the men, low let them lie, who fight against our  
   mighty prince,  
  I ruin foemen with my spell, and raise my friends to high estate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301904">4</span></span>Keener than
is the axe's edge, keener than Agni's self are they,  
  Keener than Indra's bolt are they whose Priest and President am I.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301905">5</span></span>The weapons
of these men I whet and sharpen, with valiant  
   heroes I increase their kingdom. <span id="page_a89">p. a89</span>  
  Victorious be their power and ever ageless! May all the Gods  
   promote their thoughts and wishes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301966">66</span></span>Let their
fierce powers, O Maghavan, be heightened, and upward  
   go the shout of conquering heroes.  
  Apart and clear, let shout and roar and shriek and lamentation  
   rise!  
  Let the Gods led by Indra, let the Maruts with our army go.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301907">7</span></span>Advance and
be victorious, men I Exceeding mighty be your  
   arms!  
  Smite with sharp-pointed arrows those whose bows are weak.  
  With your strong arms and weapons smite the feeble foe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301908">8</span></span>Loosed from
the bowstring fly away, thou Arrow, sharpened by  
   our prayer.  
  Assail the foemen, vanquish them, conquer each bravest man of  
   theirs, and let not one of them escape.
