### HYMN VII

#### A charm with an amulet of buck horn to drive away hereditary disease

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300701">1</span></span>The
fleet-foot Roebuck wears upon his head a healing remedy.  
  Innate disease he drives away to all directions with his horn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300702">2</span></span>With his
four feet the vigorous Buck hath bounded in pursuit of  
   thee.  
  Unbind the chronic sickness, Horn! deeply inwoven in the heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300703">3</span></span>That which
shines younder, like a roof resting on four walls,  
   down on us,— <span id="page_a73">p. a73</span>  
  Therewith from out thy body we drive all the chronic malady,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300704">4</span></span>May those
twin stars, auspicious, named Releasers, up in yonder  
   sky.  
  Loose of the chronic malady the uppermost and lowest bond.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300705">5</span></span>Water,
indeed, hath power to heal, Water drives malady away.  
  May water—for it healeth all—free thee from permanent disease.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300706">6</span></span>Hath some
prepared decoction brought inveterate disease on  
   thee,  
  I know the balm that healeth it: we drive the malady away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300707">7</span></span>What time
the starlight disappears, what time the gleams of  
  Dawn depart,  
  May evil fortune pass from us, the chronic sickness disappear.
