### HYMN XXXVI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003601">1</span></span>With these
my hymns I glorify that Indra who is alone to be  
   invoked by mortals. <span id="page_296">p. 296</span>  
  The Lord, the Mighty One, of manly vigour, victorious, Hero,  
   true, and full of wisdom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003602">2</span></span>Our ancient
sires, Navagvas, sages seven, while urging him to  
   show his might, extolled him,  
  Dweller on heights, swift smiting down opponents, guileless in  
   word, and in his thoughts most mighty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003603">3</span></span>We seek that
Indra to obtain his riches that yield much food,  
   and men, and store of heroes.  
  O Lord of Bay Steeds, bring to make us joyful, celestial wealth  
   abundant, undecaying.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003604">4</span></span>Declare to
us—if at thy hand aforetime the earlier singers have  
   obtained good fortune  
  What is thy share and portion, strong Subduer, Asura-slayer,  
   rich, invoked of many?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003605">5</span></span>He who for
car-borne, thunder-wielding Indra, hath a hymn,  
   craving deeply-piercing, fluent,  
  Who sends a song effectual, firmly-grasping, and strength-  
   bestowing, he comes near the mighty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003606">6</span></span>Strong of
thyself! thou with this art hast shattered with thought-  
   swift Parvata, him who waxed against thee;  
  And, Mightiest! rager! boldly rent in pieces things that were  
   firmly fixed and never shaken..  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003607">7</span></span>Him will we
fit for you with new devotion, the strongest,  
  Ancient One, in ancient manner.  
  So way that Indra, boundless, faithful leader, conduct us o'er all  
   places hard to traverse.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003608">8</span></span>Thou for the
people who oppress hast kindled the earthly firma-  
   ment and that of heaven.  
  With heat, O Bull, on every side consume them heat earth and  
   flood for him who hates devotion:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003609">9</span></span>Of all the
heavenly folk, of earthly creatures, thou art the King,  
  O God of splendid aspect.  
  In thy right hand, O Indra, grasp the thunder: Eternal! thou  
   destroyest all enchantments.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003610">10</span></span>Give us
confirmed prosperity, O Indra, vast and exhaustless for  
   the foes' subduing.  
  Strengthen therewith the Arya's hate and Dāsa's; and let the  
   arms of Nahushas be mighty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003611">11</span></span>Come with
thy teams which bring all blessings, hither, disposer,  
   much-invoked, exceeding holy! <span id="page_297">p. 297</span>  
  Come to me swiftly with these teams of coursers, these which  
   no fiend, no God may stay or hinder.
