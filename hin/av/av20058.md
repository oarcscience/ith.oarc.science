### HYMN LVIII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2005801">1</span></span>Turning, as
'twere, to meet the Sun, enjoy from Indra all good  
   things.  
  When he who will be born is born with power we look to  
   treasures as our heritage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2005802">2</span></span>Praise him
who sends us wealth, whose bounties injure none.  
  Good are the gifts which Indra gives.  
  He is not wroth with one who satisfies his wish: he turns his  
   mind to granting boons. <span id="page_312">p. 312</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2005803">3</span></span>Verily,
Sūrya, thou art great; truly, Āditya, thou art great.  
  As thou art great indeed thy greatness is admired: yea, verily,  
   great art thou, O God.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2005804">4</span></span>Yea, Sūrya,
thou art great in fame: thou evermore, O God,  
   art great.  
  By greatness thou art President of Gods, divine, far-spread,  
   inviolable light.
