### HYMN XI

#### A charm for the recovery of a dangerously sick man

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301101">1</span></span>For life I
set thee free by this oblation both from unmarked'.  
   decline and from consumption:  
  Or if the grasping demon have possessed him, free him from her,.  
  O Indra, thou and Agni!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301102">2</span></span>Be his days
ended, be he now departed, be he brought very  
   near to death already,  
  Out of Destruction's lap again I bring him, save him for life to  
   last a hundred autumns. <span id="page_a78">p. a78</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301103">3</span></span>With
sacrifice thousand-eyed and hundred-powered, bringing a  
   hundred lives, have I restored him,  
  That Indra through the autumns may conduct him safe to the  
   farther shore of all misfortune.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301104">4</span></span>Live, waxing
in thy strength a hundred autumns, live through  
   a hundred springs, a hundred winters!  
  Indra, Agni, Savitar, Brihaspati give thee a hundred! With  
   hundred-lived oblation have I saved him,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301105">5</span></span>Breath,
Respiration, come to him, as two car-oxen to their  
   stall!  
  Let all the other deaths, whereof men count a hundred, pass  
   away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301106">6</span></span>Breath,
Respiration, stay ye here. Go ye not hence away from  
   him,  
  Bring, so that he may reach old age, body and members back  
   again.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301107">7</span></span>I give thee
over to old age, make thee the subject of old age.  
  Let kindly old age lead thee on. Let all the other deaths, whereof  
   men count a hundred, pass away!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301108">8</span></span>Old age hath
girt thee with its bonds even as they bind a bull  
   with rope.  
  The death held thee at thy birth bound with a firmly-knotted  
   noose,  
  Therefrom, with both the hands of Truth, Brihaspati hath loose-  
   ned thee.
