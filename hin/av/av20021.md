### HYMN XXI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002101">1</span></span>We will
present fair praise unto the Mighty One, our hymns to  
  Indra in Vivasvān's dwelling-place;  
  For he hath ne'er found wealth in those who seem to sleep;  
   those who give wealth to men accept no paltry praise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002102">2</span></span>Giver of
horses, Indra, giver, thou, of kine, giver of barley,  
   thou art Lord and guard of wealth:  
  Man's helper from of old, not disappointing hope, Friend of  
   our friends, to thee as such we sing this praise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002103">3</span></span>Indra, most
splendid, powerful, rich in mighty deeds, this  
   treasure spread around is known to be thine own.  
  Gather therefrom. O Conqueror, and bring to us: fail not the  
   hope of him who loves and sings to thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002104">4</span></span>Well-pleased
with these bright flames and with these Soma  
   drops, take thou away our poverty with steeds and kine.  
  With Indra scattering the Dasyu through these drops, freed  
   from their hate may we obtain abundant food.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002105">5</span></span>Let us
obtain, O Indra, plenteous wealth and food, with strength  
   exceeding glorious, shining to the sky.  
  May we obtain the Goddess Providence, the strength of heroes,  
   special source of cattle, rich in steeds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002106">6</span></span>These our
libations, strength inspiring Soma draughts, gladdened  
   thee in the fight with Vritra, Hero-Lord, <span id="page_281">p.
281</span>  
  What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten  
   thousand Vritras, thou resistless in thy might.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002107">7</span></span>Thou goest
on from fight to fight intrepidly, destroying castle  
   after castle here with strength;  
  Thou Indra, with thy friend who makes the foe bow down,  
   slewest from far away the guileful Namuchi.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002108">8</span></span>Thou hast
stuck down in death Karanja, Parnaya, in Atithigva's  
   very glorious going forth:  
  Unyielding, when Rijisvan compassed them with siege, thou hast  
   destroyed the hundred towns of Vangrida.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002109">9</span></span>With
all-outstripping chariot wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed,  
   hast overthrown the twice ten kings of men,  
  With sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in  
   arms to fight with friendless Susravas.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002110">10</span></span>Thou hast
protected Susravas with succour, and Tūrvayāna with  
   thine aid, O Indra:  
  Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, Ayu subject unto this king, the  
   young, the mighty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002111">11</span></span>May we
protected by the Gods hereafter remain thy very pro-  
   sperous friends, O Indra.  
  Thee we extol, enjoying through thy favour life-long and joyful  
   and with store of heroes.
