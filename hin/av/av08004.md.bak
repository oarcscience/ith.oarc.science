### HYMN IV

#### Imprecations on demons

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800401">1</span></span>Indra and
Soma, burn, destroy the demon foe! Send downward,  
  O ye Bulls, those who add gloom to gloom.  
  Annihilate the fools, slay them and burn them up: chase them  
   away from us, pierce the voracious fiends. <span id="page_a331">p.
a331</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800402">2</span></span>Let sin,
Indra and Soma! round the wicked boil, like as a cald-  
   ron set amid the flames of fire.  
  Against the foe of prayer, eater of gory flesh, the fearful-eyed  
  Kimidin, keep perpetual hate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800403">3</span></span>Indra and
Soma, plunge the wicked in the depth, yea, cast them  
   into darkness that hath no support,  
  So that not one of them may ever thence return: so may your  
   wrathful might prevail and conquer them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800404">4</span></span>Indra and
Soma, hurl your deadly crushing bolt down on the  
   wicked fiend from heaven and from the earth.  
  Yea, fashion from the big clouds your celestial dart wherewith  
   ye burn to death the waxing demon race.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800405">5</span></span>Indra and
Soma, cast ye downward from the sky your deadly  
   bolts of stone burning with fiery flame,  
  Eternal, scorching darts. Plunge the voracious fiends within the  
   depth, and let them pass without a sound.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800406">6</span></span>Indra and
Soma, let this hymn control you both, even as the  
   girth encompasses two vigorous steeds  
  The song of praise which I with wisdom offer you. Do ye, as  
  Lords of men, animate these my prayers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800407">7</span></span>In your
impetuous manner think ye both thereon: destroy those  
   evil spirits, kill the treacherous fiends.  
  Indra and Soma, let the wicked have no bliss whoso at any time-  
   attacks and injures us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800408">8</span></span>Whoso
accuses me with words of falsehood when I pursue my  
   way with guileless spirit,  
  May he, the speaker of untruth, be, Indra! like water which the  
   hollowed hand compresses.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800409">9</span></span>Those who
destroy, as is their wont, the simple, and with their  
   evil natures harm the righteous,  
  May Soma give them over to the serpent, or to the lap of  
  Nirriti consign them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800410">10</span></span>O Agni,
whosoever seeks to injure the essence of our food, kine,  
   steeds, or bodies,  
  May he, the adversary, thief, and robber, sink to destruction,.  
   both himself and offspring.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800411">11</span></span>May he be
swept away, himself and children; may all the three  
   earths press him down beneath them.  
  May his fair glory, O ye Gods, be blighted, who in the day or  
   night would fain destroy us. <span id="page_a332">p. a332</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800412">12</span></span>The prudent
finds it easy to distinguish the true and false: their  
   words oppose each other.  
  Of these two that which is the true and honest Soma protects,  
   and brings the false to nothing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800413">13</span></span>Never doth
Soma aid and guide the wicked or him who falsely  
   claims the Warrior's title.  
  He slays the fiend and him who speaks untruly: both lie entan-  
   gled in the noose of Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800414">14</span></span>As if I
worshipped deities of falsehood, or thought vain thoughts  
   about the Gods, O Agni!  
  Why art thou angry with us, Jātavedas? Destruction fall on  
   those who lie against thee!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800415">15</span></span>So may I
die this day if I have harassed any man's life, or if I  
   be a demon.  
  Yea, may he lose all his ten sons together who with false tongue  
   hath called me Yātudhāna.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800416">16</span></span>May Indra
slay him with a mighty weapon, and let the vilest of  
   all creatures perish,  
  The fiend who says that he is pure, who calls me a demon  
   though devoid of demon nature.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800417">17</span></span>She too who
wanders like an owl at night-time, hiding her body  
   in her guile and malice,  
  May she fall downward into endless caverns. May press-stones  
   with loud ring destroy the demons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800418">18</span></span>Spread out,
ye Maruts, search among the people: seize ye and  
   grind the Rākshasas to pieces,  
  Who fly abroad, transformed to birds, at night-time, and sully  
   and pollute our holy worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800419">19</span></span>Hurl down
from heaven thy bolt of stone, O Indra: sharpen it,  
  Maghavan, made keen by Soma.  
  Forward, behind, and from above and under, smite down the  
   demons with thy rocky weapon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800420">20</span></span>They fly,
the demon dogs, and, bent on mischief, fain would they  
   harm indomitable Indra.  
  Sakra makes sharp his weapon for the wicked: now let him  
   cast his bolt at fiendish wizards.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800421">21</span></span>Indra hath
ever been the fiends' destroyer who spoil oblations of  
   the Gods' invokers.  
  Yea, Sakra, like an axe that splits the timber, assails and sma-  
   shes them like earthen vessels. <span id="page_a333">p. a333</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800422">22</span></span>Destroy the
fiend shaped like an owl or owlet, destroy him in.  
   the form of dog or cuckoo.  
  Destroy him shaped as eagle or as vulture: as with a stone, O  
  Indra, crush the demon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800423">23</span></span>Let not the
fiend of witchcraft-workers reach us: may Dawn.  
   drive off the couples of Kimidins.  
  Earth keep us safe from earthly woe and trouble! From grief  
   that comes from heaven Mid-air preserve us!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800424">24</span></span>Indra
destroy the demon, male and female, joying and triumph-  
   ing in arts of magic!  
  Let the fools' gods with bent necks fall and perish, and see no.  
   more the Sun when he arises.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800425">25</span></span>Look, each
one, hither, look around. Indra and Soma, watch ye  
   well.  
  Cast forth your weapon at the fiends: against the sorcerers hurl  
   your bolt.
