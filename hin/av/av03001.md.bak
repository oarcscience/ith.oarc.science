### HYMN I

#### A prayer or charm for the defeat and destruction of enemies in battle

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300101">1</span></span>Let the wise
Agni go against our foemen, burning against ill-will  
   and imprecation  
  Let him bewilder our opponents' army, Let Jātavedas smite and  
   make them handless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300102">2</span></span>Mighty are
ye for such a deed, O Maruts. Go forward, overcome  
   them and destroy them.  
  The Vasus slew, and these were left imploring. Wise Agni as our  
   messenger assail them!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300103">3</span></span>O Maghavan,
O Indra, thou who slayest fiends, and, Agni, thou,  
  Burn, both of you, against these men, the foeman's host that  
   threatens us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300104">4</span></span>Shot down
the slope, with thy two tawny coursers, forth go thy  
   bolt, destroying foes, O Indra!  
  Slay those who fly, slay those who stand and follow.  
  On every side fulfil these men's intention.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300105">5</span></span>Indra,
bewilder thou the foemen's army.  
  With Agni's, Vāta's furious rush drive them away to every side.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300106">6</span></span>Let Indra
daze their army. Let the Maruts slay it with their  
   might.  
  Let Agni take their eyes away, and let the conquered host  
   retreat.
