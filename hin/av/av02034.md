### HYMN XXXIV

#### A prayer accompanying an animal sacrifice

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203401">1</span></span>May this, of
all the beasts that Pasupati rules, Lord of animals,.  
   quadruped and biped,  
  Come, purchased, to the sacrificial portion. May growth of  
   wealth attend the sacrificer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203402">2</span></span>Loosing the
seed of future-time existence, give good success, O  
  Gods, to him who worships.  
  May what is present, duly brought, the victim, go to the deities'  
   beloved region.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203403">3</span></span>Those who
are looking, deep in meditation, on the bound ani-  
   mal with eye and spirit  
  To them, the first, may Agni, God, give freedom, rejoicing in his  
   creatures, Visvakarman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203404">4</span></span>Tame animals
of every shape, though varied in colour, manifold.  
   alike in nature  
  To them, the first, may Vāyu, God, give freedom, Prajāpati.  
   rejoicing in his creatures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203405">5</span></span>Let those
who know receive before all others the vital breath  
   proceeding from the body.  
  Go to the sky. Stay there with all thy members. By paths which  
  Gods have travelled go to Svarga.
