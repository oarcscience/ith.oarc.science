### HYMN XXXVII

#### A charm against Gandharvas and Apsarases

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403701">1</span></span>With thee, O
Plant, in olden time Atharvans smote and slew the  
   fiends.  
  Kasyapa smote with thee, with thee did Kanava and Agastya  
   smite.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403702">2</span></span>With thee we
scare and drive away Gandharvas and Apsarases.  
  O Ajasringi, chase the fiends. Cause all to vanish with thy  
   smell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403703">3</span></span>Let the
Apsarases, puffed away, go to the river, to the ford,—  
  Guggulū, Pīlā, Naladi, Aukshagandhi, Pramandini.  
  Ye have become attentive since the Apsarases have past away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403704">4</span></span>Where great
trees are, Asvatthas and Nyagrodhas with their  
   leafy crests,  
  There where your swings are green and bright, and lutes and  
   cymbals sound in tune,  
  'Ye have become attentive since the Apsarases have past away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403705">5</span></span>Hither hath
come this one, the most effectual of herbs and  
   plants.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403706">6</span></span>Let
Ajasringi penetrate, Arā4aki with sharpened horn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403707">7</span></span>From the
Gandharva, dancing near, the lord of the Apsarases,  
  Wearing the tuft of hair, I take all manhood and virility.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403708">8</span></span>With those
dread hundred iron spears, the darts of Indra, let it  
   pierce.  
  The Blyxa-fed Gandharvas, those who bring no sacrificial gift.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403709">9</span></span>With those
dread hundred golden spears, the darts of Indra, let  
   it pierce. <span id="page_a148">p. a148</span>  
  The Blyxa-fed Gandharvas, those who bring no sacrificial gift.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403710">10</span></span>O Plant, be
thou victorious, crush the Pisāchas, one and all,  
  Blyxa-fed, shining in the floods, illumining the selfish ones.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403711">11</span></span>Youthful,
completely decked with hair, one monkey-like, one  
   like a dog,—  
  So the Gandharva, putting on a lovely look, pursues a dame.  
  Him with an efficacious charm we scare and cause to vanish  
   hence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403712">12</span></span>Your wives
are the Apsarases, and ye, Gandharvas, are their  
   lords.  
  Run ye, immortal ones, away: forbear to interfere with men!
