### HYMN XLIX

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004901">1</span></span>When voices,
fain to win mid-air, ascended to the Mighty One,  
  The vigorous God was filled with joy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004902">2</span></span>Praise with
the voice the Mighty, praise the awful with the voice:  
   in heaven  
  He, the most bounteous, hath been glad.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004903">3</span></span>Praise with
the voice the Mighty: he rules in each realm. In  
   transport he  
  Hath set upon the sacred grass.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004904">4</span></span>As cows low
to their calf in stalls, so with our songs we glorify  
  This Indra, even your wondrous God who checks attack, who  
   joys in the delightful juice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004905">5</span></span>Celestial,
bounteous Giver, God, with power and might, rich,  
   mountain-like, in precious things.  
  Him soon we see for foodful booty rich in kine, brought  
   hundredfold and thousandfold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004906">6</span></span>I crave of
thee that hero strength—that thou mayst first regard  
   this prayer  
  Wherewith thou helpest Bhrigu and the Yatis and Praskanva  
   when the prize was staked.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004907">7</span></span>Wherewith
thou sentest mighty waters to the sea—Indra, that  
   manly strength of thine.  
  For ever unattainable is this power of him to whom the worlds  
   have cried aloud.
