### HYMN XIII

#### A benediction on a newly cut water channel

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301301">1</span></span>As ye, when
Ahi had been slain, flowed forth together with a  
   roar,  
  So are ye called the Roaring Ones: this, O ye Rivers, is your  
   name.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301302">2</span></span>As driven
forth by Varuna ye swiftly urged your rolling waves,  
  There Indra reached you as you flowed; hence ye are still the  
  Water-floods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301303">3</span></span>Indra
restrained you with his might. Goddesses, as ye glided  
   on  
  Not in accordance with his will: hence have ye got the name of  
  Streams.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301304">4</span></span>One only God
set foot on you flowing according to your will, <span id="page_a81">p.
a81</span>  
  The mighty ones breathed upward fast: hence; Water is the name  
   they bear.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301205">5</span></span>Water is
good, water indeed is fatness. Agni and Soma, truly,  
   both bring water.  
  May the strong rain of those who scatter sweetness come helpful  
   unto me with breath and vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301206">6</span></span>Then verily,
I see, yea, also hear them: their sound approaches  
   me, their voice comes hither.  
  Even then I think I am enjoying Amrit, what time I drink my  
   fill of you, gold coloured!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301207">7</span></span>Here, O ye
Waters, is your heart. Here is your calf, ye holy  
   ones.  
  Flow here, just here, O mighty Streams, whither I now am lead-  
   ing you.
