### HYMN L

#### A hymn to Night for protection and prosperity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905001">1</span></span>Blind him
and make him headless, Night! the serpent with the  
   pungent breath.  
  Strike from his head the wolf's two eyes, and dash the thief  
   against a post.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905002">2</span></span>Those oxen
that are thine, O Night, with sharpened horns and  
   rapid pace,  
  With those transport us safe to-day o'er difficulties everywhere.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905003">3</span></span>Uninjured in
our bodies may we pass through each succeeding  
   night,  
  And let malignities fail to pass, as men without a boat the depth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905004">4</span></span>As millet
hurried through the air before us is beheld no more.  
  So cause the man to vanish, Night, who plans to do us injury.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905005">5</span></span>The thief
hast thou kept far away, the robber driver of our kine.  
  Even him who having covered up the horse's head would lead  
   him off.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905006">6</span></span>If dealing
treasure thou hast come to-day, O highly favoured  
  Night.  
  Cause thou us to enjoy it all so that this may not pass away. <span
id="page_253">p. 253</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905007">7</span></span>Do thou
entrust us to the Dawn, all of us free from sin, O  
  Night.  
  May Dawn deliver us to Day, and Day to thee, O glorious One.
