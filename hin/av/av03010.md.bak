### HYMN X

#### A new year prayer

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301001">1</span></span>The First
hath dawned. With Yama may it be a cow to pour  
   forth milk.  
  May she be rich in milk and stream for us through many a com-  
   ing year.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301002">2</span></span>May she whom
Gods accept with joy, Night who approacheth.  
   as a cow,  
  She who is Consort of the Year, bring us abundant happiness  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301003">3</span></span>Thou whom
with reverence we approach, O Night, as model of  
   the Year,  
  Vouchsafe. us children long to live; bless us with increase of  
   our wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301004">4</span></span>This same is
she whose light first dawned upon us: she moves  
   established in the midst of others: <span id="page_a76">p.
a76</span>  
  Great powers and glories are contained within her: a first-born  
   bride, she conquers and bears children.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301005">5</span></span>Loud was the
wooden pass-gear's ring and rattle, as it made  
   annual oblation ready.  
  First Ashtakā! may we be lords of riches, with goodly children  
   and good men about us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301006">6</span></span>The shrine
of Ilā flows with oil and fatness: accept, O Jātavedas,  
   our oblations.  
  Tame animals of varied form and colour—may all the seven  
   abide with me contented.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301007">7</span></span>Come thou to
nourish me and make me prosper. Night! may the  
   favour of the Gods attend us.  
  Filled full, O Ladle, fly thou forth. Completely filled fly back  
   again.  
  Serving at every sacrifice bring to us food and energy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301008">8</span></span>This Year
hath come to us, thy lord and consort, O Ekāshtakā.  
  Vouchsafe us children long to live, bless us with increase of our  
   wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301009">9</span></span>The Seasons,
and the Seasons' Lords I worship, annual parts  
   and groups.  
  Half years, Years, Months, I offer to the Lord of all existing  
   things.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301010">10</span></span>I offer to
the Seasons, to their several groups, to Months, to  
  Years.  
  Dhātar, Vidhātar, Fortune, to the lord of all existing things.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301011">11</span></span>With
fatness and libation we sacrifice and adore the Gods.  
  Wealthy in kine may we retire to rest us in our modest homes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301012">12</span></span>Ekāshtakā,
burning with zealous fervour, brought forth her  
   babe the great and glorious Indra.  
  With him the Gods subdued their adversaries: the Lord of  
  Might became the Dasyus' slayer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301013">13</span></span>Indra's and
Soma's mother! thou art daughter of Prajāpati.  
  Satisfy thou our hearts' desires. Gladly accept our sacrifice.
