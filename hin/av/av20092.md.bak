### HYMN XCII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009201">1</span></span>Praise, even
as he is known, with song Indra the guardian of the  
   kine,  
  The Son of Truth, Lord of the brave.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009202">2</span></span>Hither his
bay steeds have been sent, red steeds are on the sacred  
   grass.  
  Where we in concert sing our songs. <span id="page_338">p.
338</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009203">3</span></span>For Indra
thunder-armed the kine have yielded mingled milk  
   and meath.  
  What time he found them in the vault.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009204">4</span></span>When I and
Indra amount on high up to the bright One's place  
   and home,  
  We, having drunk of meath, will reach his seat whose Friends  
   are three-times-seven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009205">5</span></span>Sing, sing
ye forth your songs of praise, ye Priyamedhas, sing  
   your songs:  
  Yea, let young children sing their lauds: as a strong castle praise  
   ye him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009206">6</span></span>Now loudly
let the viol sound, the lute send out its voice with  
   might,  
  Shrill be the music of the string. To Indra is the hymn upraised.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009207">7</span></span>When hither
speed the dappled cows, unflinching, easy to be  
   milked,  
  Seize quickly, as it bursts away, the Soma juice for Indra's  
   drink.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009208">8</span></span>Indra hath
drunk; Agni hath drunk all Deities have drunk their  
   fill.  
  Here Varuna shall have his home, to whom the floods have sung  
   aloud as mother-kine unto their calves.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009209">9</span></span>Thou,
Varuna, to whom belong the Seven Streams, art a glorious  
  God.  
  The waters flow into thy throat as'twere a pipe with ample  
   mouth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009210">10</span></span>He who hath
made the fleet steeds spring, well-harnessed, to the  
   worshipper,  
  He, the swift guide, is that fair form thot loosed the horses near  
   at hand.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009211">11</span></span>Indra, the
very mighty, holds his enemies in utter scorn.  
  He, far away, and yet a child, cleft the cloud smitten by his  
   voice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009212">12</span></span>He, yet a
boy exceeding small, mounted his newly-fashioned car.  
  He for his Mother and his Sire cooked the wild mighty buffalo.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009213">13</span></span>Lord of the
Home, with beauteous cheeks, ascend thy chariot  
   wrought of gold.  
  We will attend the heavenly One; the thousand-footed, red of  
   hue, matchless, who blesses where he goes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009214">14</span></span>With
reverence they come hitherward to him as to a sovran lord, <span
id="page_339">p. 339</span>  
  That they may bring him near for this man's good success, to  
   prosper and bestow his gifts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009215">15</span></span>The
Priyamedhas have observed the offering of the men of old,  
  Of ancient custom, while they strewed the sacred grass and  
   spread their sacrificial food.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009216">16</span></span>He who as
sovran Lord of men moves with his chariots  
   unrestrained,  
  The Vritra-slayer, queller of all fighting hosts, preeminent, is  
   praised in song.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009217">17</span></span>Honour that
Indra, Puruhanman! for his aid, in whose sustain-  
   ing hand of old.  
  The splendid bolt of thunder was deposited, as the great Sun  
   was set in heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009218">18</span></span>No one by
deed attains to him who works and strengthens  
   evermore:  
  No, not by sacrifice, to Indra praised of all, resistless, daring,  
   bold in might;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009219">19</span></span>The potent
Conqueror, invincible in war, him at whose birth  
   the mighty ones,  
  The kine who spread afar, sent their loud voices out, heavens,  
   earths sent their loud voices out.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009220">20</span></span>O Indra, if
a hundred heavens and if a hundred earths were  
   thine  
  No, not a thousand suns could match thee at thy birth, not  
   both the worlds, O Thunderer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009221">21</span></span>Thou, Hero,
hast performed thy hero deeds with might, yea, all  
   with strength, O Strongest One.  
  Maghavan, help us to a stable full of kine, O Thunderer, with  
   wondrous aids.
