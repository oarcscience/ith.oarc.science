### HYMN LXIII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006301">1</span></span>We will,
with Indra, and all Gods to aid us, bring these existing.  
   worlds into subjection.  
  Our sacrifice, our bodies, and our offspring, let Indra form to-  
   gether with the Ādityas.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006302">2</span></span>With the
Ādityas with the band of Maruts, may Indra be pro-  
   tector of our bodies;  
  As when the Gods came, after they had slaughtered the Asuras,.  
   keeping safe their godlike nature,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006303">3</span></span>Brought the
Sun hitherward with mighty powers, and looked!  
   about them on their vigorous God-head.  
  With this may we obtain strength God-appointed, and brave  
   sons gladden us through a hundred winters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006304">4</span></span>He who alone
bestoweth might on mortal man who offereth  
   gifts,  
  The ruler of resistless power, is Indra, sure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006305">5</span></span>When will he
trample like a weed the man who hath no gift for  
   him?  
  When verily will Indra hear our songs of praise?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006306">6</span></span>He who with
Soma juice prepared among the many harbours.  
   thee,  
  Verily Indra gains thereby tremendous might. <span id="page_315">p.
315</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006307">7</span></span>Joy,
mightiest Indra, known and marked, sprung most from  
  Soma draughts, wherewith  
  Thou smitest down the greedy fiend, for that we pray.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006308">8</span></span>Wherewith
thou helpest Adhrigu, the great Dasagva, and the  
  God  
  Who stirs the sunlight, and Sea, for that we pray.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2006309">9</span></span>Wherewith
thou dravest forth like cars Sindhu and all the  
   mighty floods.  
  To go the way ordained by Law, for that we pray.
