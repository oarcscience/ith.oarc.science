### HYMN XXXIII

#### To the Waters, for health and happiness

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103301">1</span></span>May they,
the golden-hued, the bright, the splendid, they wherein  
  Savitar was born and Agni,  
  They who took Agni as a germ, fair-coloured, the Waters, bring  
   felicity and bless us!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103302">2</span></span>They in the
midst whereof King Varuna moveth, viewing men's  
   righteous and unrighteous dealing.  
  They who took Agni as a germ, fair-coloured,—those Waters bring  
   felicity and bless us!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103303">3</span></span>Whom the
Gods make their beverage in heaven, they who wax  
   manifold in air's mid-region,  
  They who took Agni as a germ, fair-coloured,—those Waters bring  
   felicity and bless us!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0103304">4</span></span>Ye Waters,
with auspicious eye behold me: touch ye my skin  
   with your auspicious body.  
  May they, the bright and pure, distilling fatness, those Waters,  
   bring felicity and bless us.
