### HYMN X

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101001">1</span></span>Rise up,
with all your banners rise; prepare your strength, ye  
   vapoury Forms!  
  Serpents and fiends and Other Folk, charge and pursue our  
   enemies!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101002">2</span></span>Let those
who bear an evil name, in air, in heaven on earth, and  
   men,  
  After Trishandhi's will, revere your power, the sway that Know-  
   ledge gives, together with your ruddy flags.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101003">3</span></span>Let those
with iron faces, with faces like needles or like combs,  
  Flesh-eaters, rapid as the wind, cling closely to our foemen with  
  Trishandhi for their thunderbolt.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101004">4</span></span>Omniscient
Āditya, make full many a corpse to disappear.  
  Let this devoted army of Trishandhi be in my control.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101005">5</span></span>Rise up, O
Godlike Being, rise, Arbudi, with thine army: this,  
  Tribute is sacrificed to thee, Trishandhi's welcome offering  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101006">6</span></span>May this
four-footed White-foot, may this arrow brace and bind  
   thee fast:  
  Together with Trishandhi's host, be thou, O Witchcraft, meant  
   for foes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101007">7</span></span>Down let the
dim-eyed demon fly, and let her shorteared sister  
   shriek:  
  Red be the banners when the host of Arbudi hath won the day.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101008">8</span></span>Let all the
birds that move on wings come downward, all fowls  
   that roam the heavens and air's midregion. <span id="page_72">p.
72</span>  
  Let beasts of prey and flies attacks, and vultures that eat raw  
   flesh mangle and gnaw the carcase.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101009">9</span></span>By that same
binding treaty which thou madest, Brihaspati!  
   with Indra! and with Brahma,  
  By Indra's pledge I bid the Gods come hither. Conquer on this  
   side, not on their side yonder.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101010">10</span></span>Brihaspati
Angirasa, Rishis made strong and keen by prayer,  
  Have set Trishandhi in the heaven, dire weapon that destroys  
   the fiends.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101011">11</span></span>The Gods
enjoyed Trishandhi for the sake of energy and power,  
  Him under whose protection, both, Indra and yon Āditya stand.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101012">12</span></span>The Gods,
victorious, won themselves all worlds by this oblation,  
   which  
  Brihaspati Angirasa effused, a very thunderbolt, a weapon to  
   destory the friends.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101013">13</span></span>That
fiend-destroying weapon which Brihaspati Angirasa poured  
   out and made a thunderbolt.  
  Even therewith, Brihaspati, I brush that hostile armament, and  
   strike the foemen down with might.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101014">14</span></span>Over to us
come all the Gods who eat the hallowed sacrifice  
  With this oblation be ye pleased: conquer on this side, not on  
   that.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101015">15</span></span>Over,to us
let all Gods come: dear is Trishandhi's offering.  
  Keen the great pledge through which, of old, the Asuras were  
   overthrown.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101016">16</span></span>Let Vāyu
bend the arrow-points of those who are our enemies.  
  Let Indra break their arms away: no power to lay the shaft be  
   theirs!  
  Āditya utterly destroy their missile! Chandramās bar the path  
   of him who lingers!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101017">17</span></span>If they
have issued forth strongholds of Gods, and made their  
   shields of prayer,  
  Gaining protection for their lives, protection round about, make  
   all their instigation powerless  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101018">18</span></span>With the
Flesh-eater and with Death, following the Purohita,  
  On! forward with Trishandhi's host! conquering enemies  
   advance!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101019">19</span></span>Do thou,
Trishandhi, with the gloom of darkness compass round  
   our foes; <span id="page_73">p. 73</span>  
  Let none escape of them expelled with speckled butter mixt with  
   curds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101020">20</span></span>Let
White-foot fall upon those wings of our opponents' arma-  
   ment;  
  Mazed and bewildered be those hands of foes this day, O Nyar-  
   budi.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101021">21</span></span>Mazed are
the foemen, Nyarbudi! Slay thou each bravest man  
   of them: with this our army slaughter them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101022">22</span></span>Low lie the
warrior, mailed, unmailed, each foeman in the rush  
   of war.  
  Down-smitten with the strings of bows, the fastenings of mail,  
   the charge!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101023">23</span></span>The
armour-clad, the armourless, enemies clothed with coats of  
   mail,  
  All these struck down, O Arbudi, let dogs devour upon the  
   earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101024">24</span></span>Car-borne
and carless fighting men, riders and those who go  
   on foot,  
  All these, struck down, let vultures, kites, and all, the birds of  
   air devour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101025">25</span></span>Low let the
hostile army lie, thousands of corpses, on the  
   ground,  
  Pierced through and rent to pieces where the deadly weapons  
   clash in fight.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101026">26</span></span>With eagles
let them eat the evil-hearted, pierced in the vitals,  
   lying crushed and howling.  
  The foe whoe'er will fight against this our protecting sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1101027">27</span></span>With this
which Gods attend, with this which never fails to gain  
   its end,  
  Let Indra, Vritra-slayer, smite, and with Trishandhi as a bolt.
