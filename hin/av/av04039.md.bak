### HYMN XXXIX

#### A prayer to various deities for health, wealth, and prosperity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403901">1</span></span>Agni no
earth kath had mine homage. May he bless me. <span id="page_a150">p.
a150</span>  
  As I have bowed me down to Agni on the earth, so let the  
  Favouring Graces bow them down to me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403902">2</span></span>Earth is the
Cow, her calf is Agni. May she with her calf Agni  
   yield me food, strength, all my wish, life first of all, and off-  
   spring, plenty, wealth. All Hail!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403903">3</span></span>Vāyu in air
hath had mine homage. May he bless me.  
  As I have bowed me down to Vāyu in the air, so let the Favour-  
   ing Graces bow them down to me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403904">4</span></span>Air is the
Cow, her calf is Vāyu. May she with her calf Vāyu  
   yield me food, strength, all my wish, life first of all, and off-  
   spring, plenty, wealth. All Hail!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403905">5</span></span>The Sun in
heaven hath had my homage. May he bless me.  
  As I have bowed me down unto the Sun in heaven, so let the  
  Favouring Graces bow them down to me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403906">6</span></span>Heaven is
the Cow, her calf Āditya. May she yield with her calf  
   the Sun food, strength, and all my wish, life first of all, and  
   offspring, plenty, wealth. All Hail!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403907">7</span></span>To Chandra
in the quarters have I bowed me. May he bless me.  
  As unto Chandra in the quarters I have bent, so let the Favour-  
   ing Graces bow them down to me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403908">8</span></span>The quarters
are the Cows, their calf is Chandra. May they  
   yield with their calf the Moon food, strength and all my wish,  
   life first of all, and offspring, plenty, wealth. All Hail!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403909">9</span></span>Agni moves
having entered into Agni, the Rishis' son, who  
   guards from imprecations,  
  I offer unto thee with reverent worship. Let me not mar the  
  Gods' appointed service.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403910">10</span></span>Skilled in
all ways, O God, O Jātavedas, I offer what is cleansed  
   by heart and spirit.  
  To all thy seven mouths, O Jātavedas. Do thou accept with  
   pleasure my libation.
