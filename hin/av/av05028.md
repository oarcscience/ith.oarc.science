### HYMN XXVIII

#### A charm to ensure general protection and prosperity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502801">1</span></span>For
lengthened life, to last through hundred autumns, they  
   equalize with nine the nine aspirations.  
  Three in gold, three in silver, three in iron by heat are stablished  
   in their several places.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502802">2</span></span>May Agni,
Sun, and Moon, and Earth, and Waters, Sky, Air,  
   the Quarters and the Points between them,  
  And Parts of Years accordant with the Seasons by this three-  
   threaded Amulet preserve me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502803">3</span></span>In
three-threaded Charm rest triple fulness! Let Pūshan cover it  
   with milk and butter.  
  Here rest abundant store of food and people, may ample store  
   of cattle rest within it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502804">4</span></span>Enrich this
charm, Ādityas, with your treasure; magnify this,  
   when magnified, O Agni.  
  Endow it with heroic strength, O Indra: therein be lodged a  
   triple power of increase.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502805">5</span></span>With gold
let Earth protect thee, and with iron, accordant, all-  
   sustaining Agni save thee!  
  And in accordance with the plants may silver, regarding thee  
   with favour, grant thee vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502806">6</span></span>This gold,
born threefold at its first production, grew the one  
   thing that Agni loved most dearly: it fell away, one part of  
   injured Soma.  
  One part they call seed of the sapient Waters. This gold bring  
   thee long life when triply threaded!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502807">7</span></span>Three lives
of Jamadagni, thrice the vital force of Kasyapa,  
  Three sights of immortality, three lives have I prepared for thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502808">8</span></span>When with
the three-stringed charm came three strong eagles,  
   sharing the Sacred Syllable and mighty,  
  With immortality they drove off Mrityu, obscuring and conceal-  
   ing all distresses.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502809">9</span></span>The golden
guard thee from the sky, the silvern guard thee from  
   the air,  
  The iron guard thee from the earth! This man hath reached the  
   forts of Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502810">10</span></span>May these
three castles of the Gods keep thee secure on every  
   side.  
  Endowed with strength, possessing these, be thou the master of  
   thy foes, <span id="page_a192">p. a192</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502811">11</span></span>The God who
first bound on in the beginning the deities' im-  
   mortal golden castle,—  
  Him I salute with ten extended fingers. Blest be the three-  
   stringed charm I bind upon thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502812">12</span></span>Aryaman be
thy binder-on, and Pūshan and Brihaspati:  
  Whatever name the brood of day possess, therewith we fasten  
   thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502813">13</span></span>With
Seasons and with Lengths of Time, for vigour and exten-  
   ded life,  
  With all the splendour of the Sun we fasten thee about the neck.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502814">14</span></span>Drawn forth
from butter and with meath besprinkled, firm as  
   the earth, unshakable, triumphant.  
  Breaking down foes and casting them beneath me, be fastened  
   on me for exalted fortune!
