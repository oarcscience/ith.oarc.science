### HYMN LI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2005101">1</span></span>For you will
I sing Indra's praise who gives good gifts as well we  
   know;  
  Praise of the Bounteous Lord who, rich in treasure, aids his  
   singers with wealth thousandfold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2005102">2</span></span>As with a
hundred hosts he rushes boldly on, and for the offerer  
   slays his foes.  
  As from a mountain flow the water-brooks, thus flow his gifts  
   who feedeth many a one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2005103">3</span></span>Sakra I
praise, for victory, far-famed, exceeding bountiful.  
  Who gives, as 'twere in thousands, precious wealth to him who  
   sheds the juice and worships him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2005104">4</span></span>Arrows with
hundred points, unconquerable, are this Indra's  
   mighty arms in war.  
  He streams on liberal worshippers like a hill with springs, when  
   juices poured have gladdened him.
