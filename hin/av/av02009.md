### HYMN IX

#### A charm to cure dangerous disease

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200901">1</span></span>Free this
man, Dasavriksha! from the demon, from Grāhi who  
   hath seized his joints and members,  
  And raise him up again, O Tree, into the world of living men.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200902">2</span></span>He hath
arisen and come once more, rejoined the band of those  
   who live.  
  May he become the sire of sons, and of all men most fortunate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200903">3</span></span>He hath
returned to consciousness, rejoined the living's firm  
   abodes,  
  For hundred leeches are in this, yea, and a thousand healing  
   herbs.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200904">4</span></span>The Gods,
the Brāhman-priests, and plants observed the way to  
   gather thee:  
  All deities described the way men gather thee upon the earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200905">5</span></span>Let him who
made it also heal: he, truly, is the deftest leech.  
  Pure, with a leech he verily shall give thee medicines that heal.
