### HYMN XX

#### A prayer for riches and general prosperity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302001">1</span></span>This is
thine ordered place of birth whence sprung to life thou  
   shinest forth. <span id="page_a90">p. a90</span>  
  Knowing this, Agni, mount on high and cause our riches to  
   increase.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302002">2</span></span>Turn hither,
Agni, speak to us, come to us with a friendly mind.  
  Enrich us, Sovran of the Tribes! Thou art the giver of our  
   wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302003">3</span></span>Let Aryaman
vouchsafe us, wealth, and Bhaga, and Brihaspati,  
  The Goddesses grant wealth to us, Sūnritā, Goddess, give me  
   wealth!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302004">4</span></span>We call King
Soma to our aid, and Agni with our songs and.  
   hymn,  
  The Ādityas, Vishnu, Sūrya, and the Brāhman-priest Brihaspati.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302005">5</span></span>Do thou, O
Agni, with thy fires strengthen our prayer and.  
   sacrifice.  
  Incite thou us, O God, to give, and send us riches to bestow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302006">6</span></span>Both Indra
here and Vāyu we invoke with an auspicious call,  
  That in assembly all the folk may be benevolent to us, and be  
   inclined to give us gifts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302007">7</span></span>Urge Aryaman
to send us gifts, and Indra, and Brihaspati,  
  Vāta, Vishnu, Sarasvati, and the strong courser Savitar.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302008">8</span></span>Now have we
reached the ordering of power, and all these  
   worlds of life are held within it.  
  Let him who knows urge e'en the churl to bounty Give wealth.  
   to us with all good men about us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302009">9</span></span>May heaven's
five spacious regions pour their milk for me with  
   all their might.  
  May I obtain each wish and hope formed by my spirit and my  
   heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302010">10</span></span>May speech
that winneth cows be mine. With splendour mount  
   thou over me.  
  May Vāyu hedge me round about May Pūshan make me pros-  
   perous.
