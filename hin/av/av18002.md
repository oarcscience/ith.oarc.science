### HYMN II

#### A funeral hymn, taken mainly from the Rigveda

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800201">1</span></span>For Yama
Soma juice flows clear, to Yama is oblation paid.  
  To Yama sacrifice prepared, and heralded by Agni, goes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800202">2</span></span>Offer to
Yama sacrifice most sweet in savour and draw near.  
  Bow down before the Rishis of the olden time, the ancient ones  
   who made the path.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800203">3</span></span>Offer to
Yama, to the King, butter and milk in sacrifice.  
  So may he grant that we may live long days of life mid living  
   men,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800204">4</span></span>Burn him not
up, nor quite consume him, Agni. Let not his  
   body or his skin be scattered.  
  O Jātavedas, when thou hast matured him, then send him on  
   his way unto the Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800205">5</span></span>When thou
hast made him ready, Jātavedas, then do thou give  
   him over to the Fathers. <span id="page_185">p. 185</span>  
  When he attains unto the life that waits him he will obey the  
  Deities' commandment.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800206">6</span></span>With the
three jars Brihat alone makes pure the six wide-spread-  
   ing realms.  
  The Gāyatri, the Trishtup, all metres in Yama are contained.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800207">7</span></span>The Sun
receive thine eye, the wind thy spirit; go, as thy merit  
   is, to earth or heaven.  
  Go, if it be thy lot, unto the waters: go, make thy home in  
   plants with all thy members.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800208">8</span></span>Thy portion
is the goat: with heat consume him: let thy fierce  
   flame, thy glowing splendour, burn him.  
  With thine auspicious forms, O Jātavedas, bear this man to the  
   region of the pious.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800209">9</span></span>Let all thy
rapid flames, O Jātavedas, wherewith thou fillest  
   heaven and earth's mid-region,  
  Follow the goat as he goes on, united: then with the others,  
   most auspicious, aid us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_18002110">110</span></span>Away O
Agni, to the Fathers, send him who, offered in thee,  
   goes with our oblations.  
  Wearing new life let him approach his offspring, and splendid, be  
   invested with a body,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800211">11</span></span>Run and
outspeed the two dogs, Sarama's offspring, brindled,  
   four-eyed, upon thy happy pathway.  
  Draw nigh thou to the gracious-minded Fathers who take their  
   pleasure in the feast with Yama.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800212">12</span></span>And those
two dogs of thine, Yama, the watchers, four-eyed  
   who look on men and guard the pathway  
  Entrust this man, O King, to their protection, and with prosperity  
   and health endow him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800213">13</span></span>Dark-hued,
insatiate, with distended nostrils, Yama's two envoys  
   roam among the people.  
  May they restore to us a fair existence here and to-day that we  
   may see the sunlight.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800214">14</span></span>For some
the Soma juice runs clear some sit by sacrificial oil.  
  To those for whom the meath flows forth, even to those let him  
   depart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800215">15</span></span>Let him, O
Yama, go to those Rishis austere, of Fervour born,  
  First followers of Law, the sons of Law, upholders of the Law.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800246">46</span></span>Invincible
through Fervour, they who by their Fervour went to  
   heaven. <span id="page_186">p. 186</span>  
  Who practised great austerity,—even to those let him depart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800217">17</span></span>The heroes
who contend in war and boldly cast their lives away.  
  Or who give guerdon thousandfold,—even to those let him  
   depart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800218">18</span></span>Let him, O
Yama, go to those Rishis austere, of Fervour born,  
  Skilled in a thousand ways and means, the sages who protect the  
  Sun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800219">19</span></span>Be pleasant
unto him, O Earth, thornless and lulling him to rest.  
  Vouchsafe him shelter broad and sure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800220">20</span></span>In the free
amplitude of earth take roomy space to lodge thee in.  
  Let all oblations which in life thou paidest drop thee honey now.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800221">21</span></span>Hither I
call thy spirit with my spirit. Come thou; delighted,  
   to these dwelling-places.  
  Unite thee with the Fathers and with Yama: strong and  
   delicious be the winds that fan thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800222">22</span></span>Floating in
water, bringing streams, let Maruts carry thee aloft,  
  And causing coolness by their rush sprinkle thee with their fall-  
   ing rain.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800223">23</span></span>I have
recalled thy life to life, to being, power, and energy.  
  Let thy soul go unto its own: so to the Fathers hasten thou.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800224">24</span></span>Let not thy
soul be left behind: here let not aught of thee  
   remain,  
  Of spirit, body, members, sap.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800225">25</span></span>Let not a
tree oppness thee, nor Earth the great Goddess weigh  
   thee down.  
  Among the Fathers find thy home, and thrive mid those whom  
  Yama rules.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800226">26</span></span>Each parted
member, severed from thy body, thy vital breaths  
   that in the wind have vanished,  
  With all of these, piece after piece, shall Fathers who dwell to-  
   gether meet and reunite thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800227">27</span></span>Him have
the living banished from their houses: remove him to  
   a distance from the hamlet.  
  Yama's observant messenger was Mrityu he hath despatched  
   men's lives unto the Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800228">28</span></span>Those
Dasyus who, not eating our oblations, come wilh friends'  
   faces mingled with the Fathers,  
  Those who wear gross those who wear subtile bodies,—from this.  
   our sacrifice let Agni blast them. <span id="page_187">p.
187</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800229">29</span></span>Bringing
delight, prolonging our existence, here let our own, the  
  Fathers, dwell together.  
  Coming with sacrifice may we assist them, living long lives  
   through many autumn seasons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800230">30</span></span>Now by this
cow I bring thee, by the boiled rice set in milk for  
   thee,  
  Be the supporter of the folk left here without a livelihood.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800231">31</span></span>Prolong the
pleasant Dawn enriched with horses-or bearing us.  
   anew beyond the darkness.  
  Adjudged to die be he, the man who slew thee: this portion let  
   him find, and not another.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800232">32</span></span>Yama is
higher and Vivasvān lower: nothing whatever do I see  
   above him.  
  This sacrifice of mine is based on Yama, Vivasvān spread the  
   atmosphere about us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800233">33</span></span>From mortal
men they hid the immortal Lady, made one like  
   her and gave her to Vivasvān.  
  Saranyū brought to him the Asvin brothers, and then deserted  
   both twinned pairs of children.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800234">34</span></span>Bring thou
the Fathers one and all Agni, to eat the sacrifice.  
  The buried, and the cast away, those burnt with fire, and those  
   exposed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800235">35</span></span>Those,
whether flames have burnt or not consumed them, who in  
   the midst of heaven enjoy oblations—  
  Let them, when thou dost know them, Jatavedas, accept with  
   sacred food the axe and worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800236">36</span></span>Burn
gently, Agni, burn not up the body with too fervent heat.  
  Let all thy force and fury be expended on the woods and earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800237">37</span></span>I give this
place to him who hath come hither and now is mine,  
   to be a home to rest in:  
  This was the thought of Yama when he answered: This man is.  
   mine. Let him come here to riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800238">38</span></span>This date
we settle once for all, that it may ne'er be fixt again\_  
  A hundred autumns; not before.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800239">39</span></span>This date
we order, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800240">40</span></span>This date
we limit, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800241">41</span></span>This date
we measure, etc.

we mete and measure out, that it may ne'er be fixt. <span

   again. A hundred autumns: not before.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800245">45</span></span>The period
I have measured—come to heaven. I would my life  
   were long  
  Not to be measured out again; a hundred autumns, not before.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800246">46</span></span>Inbreath
and outbreath, breath diffused, life, sight to look upon  
   the Sun  
  Seek by a straight unwinding path the Fathers whom King  
  Yama rules,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800247">47</span></span>Unmarried
men who toiled and have departed, the childless,  
   having left their foes behind them,  
  Have found on high the world whereto they mounted, reflecting  
   on the ridge of vaulted heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800248">48</span></span>The lowest
is the Watery heaven, Pilumatī the middlemost;  
  The third and highest, that wherein the Fathers dwell, is called  
  Pradyaus.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800249">49</span></span>The Fathers
of our Father, his Grandfathers, those who have  
   entered into air's wide region,  
  Those who inhabit earth or dwell in heaven, these Fathers will  
   we worship with oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800250">50</span></span>Thou seest
now, and ne'er again shalt look upon, the Sun in  
   heaven.  
  Cover him as a mother draws her skirt about her son, O Earth!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800251">51</span></span>This
once,,and at no other time hereafter in a lengthened life:  
  Cover him, as a wife, O Earth, covers her husband with her  
   robe!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800252">52</span></span>Round thee
auspiciously I wrap the vesture of our Mother  
  Earth:  
  Be bliss among the living mine, oblation mid the Fathers thine!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800253">53</span></span>Ye have
prepared, pathmakers, Agni-Soma, a fair world for the  
  Gods to be the it treasure.  
  Go to that world and send us Pūshan hither to bear us on the  
   paths the goat hath trodden.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800254">54</span></span>Guard of
the world, whose cattle ne'er are injured, may Pūshan  
   bear thee hence, for he hath knowledge.

life, let Ayu guard thee, Pūshan convey thee forward  
   on the distant pathway.

   who have gone before thee. <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

yoke these carriers twain to bear thee to the spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800258">58</span></span>Mail thee
with flesh against the flames of Agni; encompass thee
