### HYMN I

#### An accompaniment to funeral ceremonies and sacrificial offerings to ancestral spirits

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800101">1</span></span>Fain would I
win my friend to kindly friendship. So may the  
  Sage, come through the air's wide ocean,  
  Remembering the earth and days to follow, obtain a son the  
   issue of his father.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800102">2</span></span>Thy friend
loves not the friendship which considers her who is  
   near in kindred as a stranger.  
  Sons of the mighty Asura, the heroes, supporters of the heaven,  
   see far around them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800103">3</span></span>Yea, this
the Immortals seek of thee with longing, a scion of the  
   only man existing.  
  Then let thy soul and mine be knit together. Embrace thy con-  
   sort as her loving husband.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800104">4</span></span>Shall we do
now what we ne'er did aforetime? we who spoke  
   righteously now talk impurely?  
  Gandharva in the floods, the Dame of Waters—such is our  
   bond, such our most lofty kinship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800105">5</span></span>Even in the
womb God Tvashtar, vivifier, shaping all forms,  
  Creator, made us consorts.  
  Ne'er are his holy statutes violated: that we are his the heaven  
   and earth acknowledge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800106">6</span></span>Who yokes
to-day unto the pole of Order the strong and passio-  
   nate steers of checkless spirit,  
  With shaft-armed mouths, heart-piercing, joy-bestowing? Long  
   shall he live who duly pays them service.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800107">7</span></span>Who knows
that earliest day whereof thou speakest, Who hath  
   beheld it? Who can here declare it?  
  Great is the law of Varuna and Mitra. What, wanton, wilt thou  
   say to men to tempt them?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800108">8</span></span>Yami am
possessed by love of Yama, that I may rest on the  
   same couch beside him.  
  I as a wife would yield me to my husband. Like car-wheels let  
   us speed to meet each other. <span id="page_175">p. 175</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800109">9</span></span>They stand
not still, they never close their eyelids, those senti-  
   nels of Gods who wander round us.  
  Not me—go quickly, wanton, with another, and hasten like a  
   chariot-wheel to meet him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800110">10</span></span>May Sūrya's
eye with days and nights endow him, and ever may  
   his light spread out before him.  
  In heaven and earth the kindred pair commingle. On Yami be  
   the unbrotherly act of Yama.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800111">11</span></span>Sure there
will come succeeding times when brothers and sisters  
   will do acts unmeet for kinsfolk.  
  Not me, O fair one—seek another husband, and make thine arm  
   a pillow for thy consort.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800112">12</span></span>Is he a
brother when no help is left her? Is she a sister when  
  Destruction cometh?  
  Forced by my love these many words I utter. Come near, and  
   hold me in thy close embraces,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800113">13</span></span>I am no
help for thee, no refuge, Yami, I will not clasp and  
   press thee to my bosom.  
  This is abhorrent to my mind and spirit—a brother on the couch  
   beside a sister.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800114">14</span></span>I will not
fold mine arms about thy body: they call it sin when  
   one comes near a sister.  
  Not me—prepare thy pleasure with another. Thy brother seeks  
   not this from thee, O fair one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800115">15</span></span>Alas; thou
art indeed a weakling Yama. We find in thee no trace  
   o f heart or spirit.  
  As round a tree the woodbine clings, another will cling about  
   thee girt as with a girdle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800116">16</span></span>Embrace
another, Yami. Let some other, even as the woodbine  
   rings a tree, enfold thee.  
  Win thou his heart and let him win thy fancy; so make with  
   him a bond of blest alliance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800117">17</span></span>Three hymns
the Sages have disposed in order, the many-formed,  
   the fair, the all-beholding.  
  These in one single world are placed and settled—the growing  
   plants, the breezes, and the waters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800118">18</span></span>The Bull
hath yielded for the Bull the milk of heaven: inviolable  
   is the Son of Aditi.  
  According to his wisdom Varuna knoweth all: he halloweth, the  
   holy, times for sacrifice. <span id="page_176">p. 176</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800119">19</span></span>Gandharvi
spake. May she, the Lady of the Flood amid the  
   river's roaring leave my heart untouched.  
  May Aditi accomplish all that we desire, and may our eldest  
  Brother tell us this as chief.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800120">20</span></span>Yea, even
this blessed Morning, rich in store of food, splendid,  
   with heavenly lustre, hath shone out for man,  
  Since they as was the wish of yearning Gods, brought forth that  
   yearning Agni for the assembly as the Priest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800121">21</span></span>And the
fleet Falcon brought for sacrifice from afar this flowing.  
   drop most excellent and passing wise,  
  Then when the Aryan tribes chose as invoking Priest Agni the  
   wonder-worker, and the hymn rose up.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800122">22</span></span>Still art
thou kind to him who feeds thee as with grass, and.  
   skilled in sacrifice offers thee holy gifts.  
  When thou having received the sage's strengthening food with  
   lauds, after long toil comest with many more.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800123">23</span></span>Urge thou
thy Parents, as a lover, to delight: the lovely One  
   desires and craves it from his heart.  
  As Priest he calls aloud, as Warrior shows his skill, as Asura tries  
   his strength, and with the hymn is stirred.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800124">24</span></span>Far famed
is he, the mortal man, O Agni thou Son of strength,  
   who hath obtained thy favour.  
  He, gathering power, borne onward by his horses, makes his,  
   days lovely in his might and splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800125">25</span></span>Hear us, O
Agni, in the great assembly: harness thy rapid car,.  
   the car of Amrit.  
  Bring Heaven and Earth, the Deities' Parents, hither: stay with  
   us here, nor from the Gods be absent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800126">26</span></span>When, holy
Agni, the divine assembly, the holy synod mid the  
  Gods, is gathered,  
  And when thou, godlike One, dealest forth treasures vouchsafe  
   us too our portion of the riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800127">27</span></span>Agni hath
looked upon the van of Mornings, and on the days.  
   the earliest Jātavedas.  
  After the Dawns, after their rays of brightness, Sūrya hath enter-  
   ed into earth and heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800128">28</span></span>Agni hath
looked against the van of Mornings, against the days-  
   the earliest Jātavedas;  
  In many a place against the beams of Sūrya, against the heavens  
   and earth hath he extended. <span id="page_177">p. 177</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800129">29</span></span>Heaven and
Earth, first by everlasting Order, speakers of truth,  
   are near enough to hear us,  
  When the God, urging men to worship, sitteth as Priest, assum-  
   ing all his vital vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800130">30</span></span>As God
comprising Gods by Law eternal, bear, as the chief who  
   knoweth, our oblation,  
  Smoke-bannered with the fuel, radiant, joyous, better to praise  
   and worship, Priest for ever.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800131">31</span></span>I praise
your work .that ye may make me prosper: hear, Heaven  
   and Earth, twain worlds that drop with fatness!  
  While days and Gods go to the world of spirits, have let the  
  Parents with sweet mead refresh us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800132">32</span></span>When the
Cow's nectar wins the God completely, men here  
   below are heaven's and earth's sustainers  
  All the Gods come to this thy heavenly Yajus which from the  
   motley Pair milked oil and water  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800133">33</span></span>Hath the
King seized us? How have we offended against his  
   holy Ordinance? Who knoweth?  
  For even Mitra mid the Gods is angry. There are both song and  
   wealth for those who come not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800134">34</span></span>'Tis hard
to understand the Immortal's nature, where she who  
   is akin becomes a stranger.  
  Guard ceaselessly, great Agni, him who ponders Yama's name  
   easy to be comprehended.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800135">35</span></span>They in the
synod where the Gods rejoice them, where they are  
   seated in Vivasvan's dwelling,  
  Have given the Moon his beams, the Sun his splendour: the  
   two unweariedly maintain their brightness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800136">36</span></span>The counsel
which the Gods meet to consider, their secret plan,  
   of that we have no knowledge.  
  There let God Savitar, Aditi, and Mitra proclaim to Varuna that  
   we are sinless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800137">37</span></span>Companions,
let us learn a prayer to Indra whom the thunder  
   arms,  
  To glorify your bold and most heroic Friend.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800138">38</span></span>For thou by
slaying Vritra art the Vritra-slayer, famed for  
   might.  
  Thou, Hero, in rich gifts surpassest wealthy chiefs.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800139">39</span></span>O'er the
broad land thou goest like a Stega: here on vast earth  
   let breezes blow upon us, <span id="page_178">p. 178</span>  
  Here hath our dear Friend Varuna, united, like Agni in the  
   wood, shot forth his splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800140">40</span></span>Sing praise
to him the chariot-borne, the famous, Sovran of men,  
   the dread and strong destroyer.  
  O Rudra, praised be gracious to the singer; let thy darts spare  
   us and smite down another.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800141">41</span></span>The pious
call Sarasvati, they worship Sarasvati while sacrifice  
   proceedeth.  
  The virtuous call Sarasvati to hear them. Sarasvati send bliss to  
   him who giveth!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800142">42</span></span>Sarasvati
is called on by the Fathers who come right forward to  
   our solemn worship.  
  Seated upon this sacred grass rejoice you. Give thou us  
   strengthening food that brings no sickness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800143">43</span></span>Sarasvati,
who comest with the Fathers, joying in hymns, O  
  Goddess, and oblations,  
  Give plenteous wealth to this the sacrificer, a portion, worth a  
   thousand, of refreshment.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800144">44</span></span>May they
ascend, the lowest, highest, midmost, the Fathers, who  
   deserve a share of Soma.  
  May they who have attained to life, the Fathers, righteous and  
   gentle, aid us when we call them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800145">45</span></span>I have
attained the gracious-minded Fathers, I have gained son  
   and progeny from Vishnu.  
  They who enjoy pressed juices with oblation, seated on sacred  
   grass, come oftenest hither.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800146">46</span></span>Now be this
homage offered to the Fathers, to those who passed  
   of old and those who followed,  
  Those who have rested in the earthly region and those who  
   dwell among the happy races.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800147">47</span></span>Mātali
prospers there with Kavyas, Yama with Angiras' sons,  
  Brihaspati with singers.  
  Exalters of the Gods, by Gods exalted, aid us those Fathers in  
   our invocations?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800148">48</span></span>Yes, this
is good to taste and full of sweetness, verily it is strong  
   and rich in flavour.  
  No one may conquer Indra in the battle when he hath drunken  
   of the draught we offer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800149">49</span></span>Honour the
King with your oblations, Yama, Vivasvān's son, who  
   gathers men together. <span id="page_179">p. 179</span>  
  Even him who travelled o'er the mighty rivers, who searches out  
   and shows the path to many.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800150">50</span></span>Yama first
found for us the road to travel: this pasture never  
   can be taken from us.  
  Men born on earth tread their own paths that lead them whither  
   our ancient Fathers have departed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800151">51</span></span>Fathers who
sit on sacred grass, come, help us: these offsprings  
   have we made for you; accept them.  
  So come to us with most auspicious favour: bestow on us  
   unfailing health and plenty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800152">52</span></span>Bowing
their bended knees and seated southward let all accept  
   this sacrifice with favour.  
  Punish us not for any sin, O fathers which we through human  
   frailty have committed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800153">53</span></span>Tvashtar
prepares the bridal for his daughter: therefore the  
   whole of this our world assembles.  
  But Yama's mother, spouse of great Vivasvān, vanished as she  
   was carried to her dwelling.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800154">54</span></span>Go forth,
go forth upon the homeward pathways whither our  
   sires of old have gone before us.  
  Then shalt thou look on both the Kings enjoying their sacred  
   food, God Varuna and Yama.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800155">55</span></span>Go hence,
depart ye, fly in all directions. This world for him the  
  Fathers have provided.  
  Yama bestow upon this man a dwelling adorned with days and  
   beams of light and waters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800156">56</span></span>We set thee
down with yearning, and with yearning we enkindle  
   thee,  
  Yearning, bring yearning Fathers nigh to eat the food of  
   sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800157">57</span></span>We,
splendid men, deposit thee, we, splendid men, enkindle thee.  
  Splendid, bring splendid Fathers nigh to eat the sacrificial food.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800158">58</span></span>Our Fathers
are Angirases, Navagvas, Atharvans, Bhrigus, who  
   deserve the Soma.  
  May these, the holy, look on us with favour; may we enjoy  
   their gracious loving-kindness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800159">59</span></span>Come, Yama,
with Angirases, the holy; rejoice thee here with  
   children of Virūpa.  
  Seated on sacred grass at this oblation: I call Vivasvān too, thy  
   father, hither. <span id="page_180">p. 180</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800160">60</span></span>Come, seat
thee on this bed of grass. O Yama, accordant with  
  Angirases and Fathers.  
  Let texts recited by the sages bring thee. O. King, let this  
   oblation make thee joyful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800161">61</span></span>He hath
gone hence and risen on high mounting heaven's ridges  
   by that path  
  Whereon the sons of Angiras, the conquerors of earth, went up.
