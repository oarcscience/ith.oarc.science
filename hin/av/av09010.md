### HYMN X

#### Continuation of Hymn 9

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901001">1</span></span>How on the
Gāyatri the Gāyatri was based; how from the  
  Trishtup they fashioned the Trishtup forth:  
  How on the Jagatī was based the Jagatī—they who know this  
   have won themselves immortal life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901002">2</span></span>With Gāyatri
he measures out the praise-song, Sāman with  
   praise-song, triplet with the Trishtup, <span id="page_a387">p.
a387</span>  
  The triplet with the two or four-foot measure, and with the  
   syllable they form seven metres.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901003">3</span></span>With Jagatī
the flood in heaven he stablished, and saw the Sun  
   in the Rathantara Sāman.  
  Gāyatri hath, they say, three logs for burning: hence it excels  
   in majesty and vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901004">4</span></span>I invocate
this Milch-cow good at milking, so that the Milker,  
   deft of hand, may milk her.  
  May "Savitar give goodliest stimulation. The caldron is made  
   hot: he will proclaim it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901005">5</span></span>She, Lady of
all treasures, hath come hither, yearning in spirit  
   for her calf, and lowing.  
  May this Cow yield her milk for both the Asvins, and may she  
   prosper to our high advantage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901006">6</span></span>The Cow hath
lowed after her blinking youngling: she licks his  
   forehead as she lows, to form it.  
  His mouth she fondly calls to her warm udder, and suckles him  
   with milk while gently lowing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901007">7</span></span>He also
snorts, by whom encompassed round the Cow lows as  
   she closely clings to him who sheds the rain.  
  She with her shrilling cries hath humbled mortal men, and turn-  
   ed to lightning, hath stripped off her covering robe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901008">8</span></span>That which
hath breath and life and speed and motion lies  
   firmly stablished in the midst of houses.  
  The living moves by powers of the departed: the immortal is  
   the brother of the mortal.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901009">9</span></span>The old hath
waked the young Moon from his slumber, who  
   runs his circling course with many round him.  
  Behold the God's high wisdom in its greatness: he who died  
   yesterday to-day is living.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901010">10</span></span>He who hath
made him doth not comprehend him: from him  
   who saw him surely he is hidden.  
  He, yet enveloped in his mother's bosom, source of much life,  
   hath sunk into destruction.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901011">11</span></span>I saw the
Herdsman, him who never stumbles, approaching by  
   his pathways and departing.  
  He clothed with gathered and diffusive splendours, within the  
   worlds continually travels.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901012">12</span></span>Dyaus is
our father, our begetter: kinship is here. This great  
  Earth is our kin and mother. <span id="page_a388">p. a388</span>  
  Between the wide-spread world-halves is the birth-place. The  
  Father laid the Daughter's germ within it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901013">13</span></span>I bid thee
tell me earth's extremest limit, about the Stallion's  
   genial flow I ask thee;  
  I ask about the universe's centre, and touching highest heaven  
   where Speech abideth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901014">14</span></span>The earth's
most distant limit is this altar: this Soma is the  
  Stallion's genial humour;  
  This sacrifice the universe's centre: this Brāhman highest heaven  
   where Speech abideth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901015">15</span></span>What thing
I truly am I know not clearly: mysterious, fettered  
   in my mind I wander.  
  When the first-born of holy Law approached me, then of this  
  Speech I first obtain a portion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901016">16</span></span>Back,
forward goes he, grasped by power inherent, immortal  
   born the brother of the mortal.  
  Ceaseless they move in opposite directions: men mark the one  
   and fail to mark the other.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901017">17</span></span>Seven germs
unripened yet are Heaven's prolific seed: their  
   functions they maintain by Vishnu's ordinance.  
  Endued with wisdom through intelligence and thought, present  
   on every side they compass us about.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901018">18</span></span>Upon what
syllable of holy praise-hymn, as 'twere their highest  
   heaven, the Gods repose them  
  Who knows not this, what will he do with praise-hymn? But  
   they who know it well sit here assembled.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901019">19</span></span>They,
ordering the verse's foot by measure, with the half-verse  
   arranged each thing that moveth.  
  Prayer was diffused in many forms three-footed thereby the  
   world's four regions have their being  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901020">20</span></span>Fortunate
mayst thou be with goodly pasture, and may we also  
   be exceeding wealthy.  
  Feed on the grass, O Cow, through all the seasons, and coming  
   hitherward drink limpid water.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901021">21</span></span>Forming the
water-floods the Cow herself hath lowed, one-foot-  
   ed or two-footed or four-footed, she,  
  Who hath become eight-footed or acquired nine feet, the uni-  
   verse's thousand-syllabled Pankti. From her descend in  
   streams the seas of water. <span id="page_a389">p. a389</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901022">22</span></span>Dark the
descent: the birds are golden-coloured. Robed in the  
   floods they fly aloft to heaven.  
  Again from Order's seat have they descended, and inundated all  
   the earth with fatness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901023">23</span></span>The
footless Maid precedeth footed creatures. Who marketh,  
  Mitra Varuna! this your doing?  
  The Babe unborn supporteth this world's burthen, supporteth  
  Right and watcheth Wrong and Falsehood.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901024">24</span></span>Virāj is
Speech, and Earth, and Air's mid-region. He is Praja-  
   pati, and he is Mrityu.  
  He is the Lord Imperial of the Sādhyas. He rules what is and  
   what shall be hereafter. May he make me lord of what is and  
   shall be.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901025">25</span></span>1 saw from
far away the smoke of fuel with spires that rose on  
   high o'er that beneath it.  
  The heroes cooked and dressed the spotted bullock. These were  
   the customs in the days aforetime.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901026">26</span></span>Three with
long tresses show in ordered season. One of them  
   sheareth when the year is ended.  
  One with his powers the universe regardeth. Of one the sweep  
   is seen, but not the figure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901027">27</span></span>Speech hath
been measured out in four divisions: the Brāhmans  
   who have wisdom comprehend them.  
  Three, kept in close concealment, cause no motion. Of Speech  
   men speak the fourth division only.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0901028">28</span></span>They call
him Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni; and he is heavenly  
   nobly-winged Garutmān.  
  That which is One bards call by many a title: they call It Agni,  
  Yama, Mātariswan.
