### HYMN CXXXVII

#### A composite hymn in praise of Indra

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013701">1</span></span>When, foul
with secret spot and stain, ye hastened onward to  
   the breast.  
  All Indra's enemies were slain and passed away like froth and  
   foam.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013702">2</span></span>Indra is he,
O men, who gives us happiness: sport, urge the  
   giver of delight to win the spoil.  
  Bring quickly down, O priests, hither to give us aid, to drink  
   the Soma, Indra son of Nishtigri.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013703">3</span></span>So have I
glorified with praise strong Dadhikrāvan, conquering  
   steed.  
  Sweet may he make our mouths; may he prolong the days we  
   have to live.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013704">4</span></span>The Somas
very rich in sweets, for which the sieve is destined,  
   flow,  
  Effused, the source of Indra's joy. May your strong juices reach  
   the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013705">5</span></span>Indu flows
on for Indra's sake—thus have the deities declared.  
  The Lord of Speech exerts himself, ruler of all, because of  
   might.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013706">6</span></span>Inciter of
the voice of song, with thousand streams the ocean  
   flows,  
  Even Soma, Lord of Opulence, the friend of Indra, day by day.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013707">7</span></span>The black
drop sank in Ansumati's bosom, advancing with ten  
   thousand round about it.  
  Indra with might longed for it as it panted: the hero-hearted  
   laid aside his weapons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013708">8</span></span>I saw the
drop in the far distance moving, on the slope bank of  
  Ansumati's river,  
  Like a black cloud that sank into the water. Heroes. I send you  
   forth. Go, fight in battle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013709">9</span></span>And then the
drop in Ansumati's bosom, splendid with light,  
   assumed its proper body;  
  And Indra with Brihaspati to aid him, conquered the godless  
   tribes that came against him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013710">10</span></span>Then, at
thy birth, thou wast the foeman, Indra, of those the  
   seven who ne'er had met a rival. <span id="page_374">p. 374</span>  
  The hidden pair, the heaven and earth, thou foundest, and to  
   the mighty worlds thou gavest pleasure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013711">11</span></span>So,
Thunder-armed! thou with thy bolt of thunder didst boldly  
   smite that power which none might equal;  
  With weapons broughtest low the might of Sushna, and, Indra,  
   foundest by thy strength the cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013712">12</span></span>We make
this Indra very strong to strike the mighty Vritra  
   dead:  
  A vigorous Hero shall he be.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013713">13</span></span>Indra was
made for giving, set, most mighty, o'er the joyous  
   draught,  
  Bright, meet for Soma, famed in song.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2013714">14</span></span>By song, as
'twere, the powerful bolt which none may parry was  
   prepared:  
  Lofty, invincible he grew.
