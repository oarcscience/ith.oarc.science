### HYMN III

#### A prayer for the destruction of demons

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800301">1</span></span>I balm with
oil the mighty demon-slayer, to the most famous  
   friend I come for shelter.  
  Enkindled, sharpened by our rites, may Agni protect us in the  
   day and night from evil.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800302">2</span></span>O Jātavedas,
armed with teeth of iron, enkindled with thy flame,  
   attack the demons.  
  Seize with thy tongue the foolish gods' adorers: rend, put with-  
   in thy mouth the raw-flesh-eaters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800303">3</span></span>Apply thy
teeth, the upper and the lower, thou who hast both,  
   enkindled and destroying.  
  Roam also in the air, O King, around us, and with thy jaws  
   assail the wicked spirits.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800304">4</span></span>Pierce
through the Yātudhāna's skin, O Agni; let the destroying  
   dart with fire consume him.  
  Rend his joints, Jātavedas! let the eater of raw flesh, seeking  
   flesh, tear and destroy him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800305">5</span></span>Where now
thou seest, Agni Jātavedas! a Yātudhāna, standing  
   still or roaming.  
  Or one that flieth through the air's mid-region, kindled to fury  
   as an archer pierce him. <span id="page_a328">p. a328</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800306">6</span></span>Bending thy
shafts through sacrifices, Agni! dipping thine  
   arrows in the hymn to point them,  
  Pierce to the heart therewith the Yātudhānas, and break their  
   arms uplifted to attack thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800307">7</span></span>Rescue the
captives also, Jātavedas! yea, those whom Yātudhā-  
   nas' spears have captured.  
  Strike down that fiend, blazing before him, Agni! Let spotted  
   carrion-eating kites devour him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800308">8</span></span>Here tell
this forth, O Agni: whosoever is, he himself, or acteth  
   as, a demon,  
  Grasp him, O thou most youthful, with thy fuel: to the Man-  
  Seer's eye give him as booty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800309">9</span></span>With keen
glance guard the sacrifice, O Agni: thou Sage, con-  
   duct it onward to the Vasus.  
  Let not the fiends, O Man-Beholder, harm thee burning against  
   the Rākshasas to slay them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800310">10</span></span>Look on the
fiend, 'mid men, as Man-Beholder: rend thou his  
   three extremities in pieces.  
  Demolish with thy flame his ribs, O Agni: the Yātudhāna's  
   root destroy thou triply.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800311">11</span></span>Thrice,
Agni, let thy noose surround the demon who with his  
   falsehood injures holy Order.  
  Loud roaring with thy flame, Jātavedas, fetter him in the pre-  
   sense of the singer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800312">12</span></span>Agni, what
curse the pair this day may utter, what rude rough  
   word the worshippers have spoken,  
  Each arrowy taunt sped from the angry spirit,—pierce to the  
   heart therewith the Yātudhānas.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800313">13</span></span>With
fervent heat exterminate the demons: destroy the fiends  
   with glow and flame, O Agni.  
  Destroy with fire the foolish gods' adorers: destroy the insatiate  
   fiercely-burning creatures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800314">14</span></span>May Gods
destroy to-day the evil-doer: may uttered curses turn  
   again and strike him.  
  Let arrows pierce the liar in his vitals, and Visva's net enclose  
   the Yātudhāna.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800315">15</span></span>The fiend
who smears himself with flesh of cattle, with flesh of  
   horses and of human bodies,  
  Who steals the milch-cow's milk away, O Agni,—tear off the  
   heads of such with fiery fury. <span id="page_a329">p. a329</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800316">16</span></span>Let the
fiends steal the poison of the cattle: may Aditi cast off  
   the evil-doers.  
  May the God Savitar give them up to ruin, and be their share  
   of herbs and plants denied them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800317">17</span></span>The cow
gives milk each year, O Man-Beholder: let not the  
  Yātudhāna ever taste it.  
  Agni, if one should glut him with the biestings, pierce with thy  
   flame his vitals as he meets thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800318">18</span></span>Agni, from
days of old thou slayest demons: never have  
  Rākshasas in fight o'ercome thee.  
  Burn up the foolish ones, the flesh-devourers: let none of them  
   escape thy heavenly arrow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800319">19</span></span>Guard us, O
Agni, from above and under, protect us from be-  
   hind and from before us;  
  And may thy flames, most fierce and never wasting, glowing  
   with fervent heat, consume the sinner.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800320">20</span></span>From rear,
from front, from under, from above us, Agni, pro-  
   tect us as a sage with wisdom.  
  Guard to old age thy friend as friend eternal: O Agni, as im-  
   mortal, guard us mortals.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800321">21</span></span>Lend thou
the worshipper that eye, O Agni, where with thou  
   lookest on the hoof-armed demons.  
  With light celestial in Atharvan's manner burn up the fool who  
   ruins truth with falsehood.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800322">22</span></span>We set thee
round us as a fort, victorious Agni! thee, a sage,  
  In conquering colour day by day, destroyer of the treacherous  
   foe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800323">23</span></span>With deadly
poison strike thou back the treacherous brood of  
  Rākshasas,  
  O Agni, with thy sharpened glow, with rays that flash with  
   points of flame.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800324">24</span></span>Agni shines
far and wide with lofty splendour, and by his great-  
   ness makes all things apparent.  
  He conquers godless and malign enchantments, and sharpens  
   both his horns to gore the ogres.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800325">25</span></span>Thy two
unwasting horns, O Jātavedas, keen-pointed weapons,  
   sharpened by devotion  
  With these transfix the wicked-souled Kimidin, with fierce flame,  
  Jātavedas! when he meets thee. <span id="page_a330">p. a330</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800326">26</span></span>Bright,
radiant, meet to be adored, immortal with refulgent  
   glow,  
  Agni drives Rākshasas away.
