### HYMN XII

#### An Apri or propitiatory hymn

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501201">1</span></span>Thou in the
house of man this day enkindled worshippest Gods  
   as God, O Jātavedas.  
  Observant, bright as Mitra, bring them hither. Thou art a  
   sapient and foreknowing envoy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501202">2</span></span>Tanùnapāt,
fair-tongued! with sweet meath balming the baths  
   and ways of Order, make them pleasant.  
  Bear to the Gods our sacrifice, exalting with holy thoughts our  
   hymns of praise and worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501203">3</span></span>Invoked,
deserving prayer and adoration, O Agni, come accor  
   dant with the Vasus.  
  Thou art, O youthful Lord, the Gods' Invoker, so, best of sacri-  
   ficers, bring them quickly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501204">4</span></span>By rule the
Sacred Grass is scattered eastward, a robe to clothe  
   this earth when dawns are breaking.  
  Widely it spreads around and far extended, fair for the Gods  
   and bringing peace and freedom,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501205">5</span></span>Let the
expansive Doors be widely opened, like wives who deck  
   their beauty for their husbands.  
  Lofty, celestial, all-impelling Portals, admit the Gods and give  
   them easy entrance!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501206">6</span></span>Pouring
sweet dews let holy Night and Morning, each close to  
   each, be seated at their station,—  
  Lofty, celestial Dames with gold to deck them, assuming all  
   their fair and radiant beauty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501207">7</span></span>Come the
first two celestial sweet-voiced Hotars, arranging  
   sacrifice for man to worship, <span id="page_a169">p. a169</span>  
  As singers who inspire us in assemblies, showing the eastern  
   light with their direction!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501208">8</span></span>Let Bhārati
come quickly to our worship and Ilā showing like a  
   human being.  
  So let Sarasvati and both her fellows, deft Goddesses, on this  
   fair grass be seated.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501209">9</span></span>Hotar more
skilled in sacrifice, bring hither with speed to-day  
  God Tvashar, thou who knowest,  
  Even him who formed these two, the Earth and Heaven, the  
  Parents, with their forms, and every creature.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501210">10</span></span>Bring thou
to our oblations which thou balmest the companies  
   of Gods in ordered season.  
  Agni, Vanaspati, the Immolator sweeten our offered gifts with  
   meath and butter!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501211">11</span></span>Agni as
soon as he was born made ready the sacrifice and was  
   the Gods' preceder.  
  May the Gods eat our offering consecrated according to this true  
  Priest's voice and guidance.
