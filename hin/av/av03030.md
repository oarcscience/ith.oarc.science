### HYMN XXIX

#### On the means to obtain immunity from taxation in the next world

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303001">1</span></span>Freedom from
hate I bring to you, concord and unanimity.  
  Love one another as the cow loveth the calf that she hath borne.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303002">2</span></span>One-minded
with his mother let the son be loyal to his sire.  
  Let the wife, calm and gentle, speak words sweet as honey to her  
   lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303003">3</span></span>No brother
hate his brother, no sister to sister be unkind.  
  Unanimous, with one intent, speak ye your speech in friend-  
   liness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303004">4</span></span>That spell
through which Gods sever not, nor ever bear each  
   other hate,  
  That spell we lay upon your home, a bond of union for the  
   men.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303005">5</span></span>Intelligent,
submissive, rest united, friendly and kind, bearing  
   the yoke together.  
  Come, speaking sweetly each one to the other. I make you one-  
   intentioned and one-minded. <span id="page_a102">p. a102</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303006">6</span></span>Let what you
drink, your share of food be common together,  
   with one common bond I bid you.  
  Serve Agni, gathered round him like the spokes about the  
   chariot nave.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0303007">7</span></span>With binding
charm I make you all united, obeying one sole  
   leader and one-minded.  
  Even as the Gods who watch and guard the Amrit, at morn and  
   eve may ye be kindly-hearted.
