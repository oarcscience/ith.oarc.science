### HYMN VII

#### A counter-charm against imprecation and malignity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200701">1</span></span>Hated by
sinners, sprung from Gods, this Plant that turns the  
   curse away  
  Hath washed from me all curses, as water makes clean from  
   spot and stain.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200702">2</span></span>All curses
of a rival, each curse of a female relative, Curse  
   uttered by an augry priest, all these we tread beneath our feet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200703">3</span></span>Spread on
the surface of the earth, downward from heaven thy  
   root depends: <span id="page_a40">p. a40</span>  
  With this that hath a thousand joints keep thou us safe on every  
   side.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200704">4</span></span>Guard on all
sides this woman, guard my children, us, and all  
   our wealth!  
  Let not malignity o'ercome, nor adversaries conquer us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200705">5</span></span>Upon the
curser fall his curse! Dwell we with him whose heart  
   is true!  
  We split the cruel villain's ribs whose evil eye bewitches us.
