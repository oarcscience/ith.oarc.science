### HYMN XII

#### A benediction on a newly built house

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301201">1</span></span>Here, even
here I fix my firm-set dwelling; flowing with fatness  
   may it stand in safety.  
  May we approach thee, House! with all our people, uncharmed  
   and goodly men, and dwell within thee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301202">2</span></span>Even here, O
House, stand thou on firm foundation, wealthy in  
   horses, rich in kine and gladness.  
  Wealthy in nourishment. in milk and fatness, rise up for great  
   felicity and fortune.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301203">3</span></span>A spacious
store, O House, art thou, full of clean corn and  
   lofty-roofed.  
  Let the young calf and little boy approach thee, and milch-kine  
   streaming homeward in the evening.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301204">4</span></span>This House
may Savitar and Vāyu stablish, Brihaspati who  
   knows the way, and Indra.  
  May the moist Maruts sprinkle it with fatness, and may King  
  Bhaga make our corn-land fruitful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301205">5</span></span>Queen of the
home! thou, sheltering, kindly Goddess, wast sta-  
   blished by the Gods in the beginning.  
  Clad in thy robe of grass be friendly-minded, and give us wealth  
   with goodly men about us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301206">6</span></span>Thou Pole,
in ordered fashion mount the pillar. Strong, shining  
   forth afar, keep off our foemen.  
  House! let not those who dwell within thee suffer. Live we with  
   all our men, a hundred autumns.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301207">7</span></span>To this the
tender boy hath come, to this the calf with all the  
   beasts,  
  To this crock of foaming drink, hither with jars of curdled  
   milk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301208">8</span></span>Bring
hitherward, O dame, the well-filled pitcher, the stream  
   of molten butter blent with nectar.  
  Bedew these drinkers with a draught of Amrit.  
  May all our hopes' fulfilment guard this dwelling.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301209">9</span></span>Water that
kills Consumption, free from all Consumption, here  
  I bring.  
  With Agni, the immortal one, I enter and possess the house.
