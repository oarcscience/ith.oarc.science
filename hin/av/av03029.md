### HYMN XXIX

#### On the means to obtain immunity from taxation in the next world

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302901">1</span></span>When yonder
kings who sit beside Yama divide among them-  
   selves the sixteenth part of hopes fulfilled,  
  A ram bestowed as sacrifice, white-footed, frees us from the tax.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302902">2</span></span>He satisfies
each hope and want, prevailing, present and pre-  
   pared.  
  The wish-fulfilling ram, bestowed, white-footed is exhaustless  
   still.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302903">3</span></span>He who
bestows a white-hooved ram, adequate to the place he  
   holds.  
  Ascends to the celestial height, the heaven where tribute is not  
   paid to one more mighty by the weak.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302904">4</span></span>He who
bestows a white-hooved ram, adequate to the place he  
   holds.  
  Offered with five cakes, lives on that, unwasting, in the Fathers'  
   world.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302905">5</span></span>He who
bestows a white-hooved ram, adequate to the place he  
   holds,  
  Offered with five cakes, lives on that, wasteless, while Sun and.  
  Moon endure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302906">6</span></span>Like a
refreshing draught, like sea, the mighty flood, he faileth  
   not.  
  Like the two Gods whose home is one, the ram white-footed,  
   faileth not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302907">7</span></span>Whose gift
was this, and given to whom? Kāma to Kāma gave  
   the gift.  
  Kāma is giver, Kāma is receiver. Kāma has passed into the sea.  
  Through Kāma do I take thee to myself. O Kāma, this is thine. <span
id="page_a101">p. a101</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302708">8</span></span>May Earth
receive thee as her own, and this great interspace of  
   air.  
  Neither in breath and body nor in progeny may this acceptance  
   do me harm.
