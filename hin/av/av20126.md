### HYMN CXXVI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012601">1</span></span>Men have
abstained from pouring juice; nor counted Indra as a  
  God.  
  Where at the votary's store my friend Vrishākapi hath drunk his  
   fill. Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012602">2</span></span>Thou, Indra,
heedless passest by the ill Vrishākapi hath  
   wrought;  
  Yet nowhere else thou findest place wherein to drink the Soma  
   juice. Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012603">3</span></span>What hath he
done to injure thee, this tawny beast Vrishākapi,  
  With whom thou art so angry now? What is the votary's food-  
   ful store? Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012604">4</span></span>Soon may the
hound who hunts the boar seize him and bite him  
   in the ear,  
  O Indra, that Vrishākapi whom thou protectest as a friend.  
  Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012605">5</span></span>Kapi hath
marred the beauteous things, all deftly wrought, that  
   were my joy.  
  In pieces will I rend his head; the sinner's portion shall be woe.  
  Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012606">6</span></span>No dame hath
ampler charms than I, or greater wealth of love's  
   delights.  
  None with more ardour offers all her beauty to her lord's  
   embrace. Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012607">7</span></span>Mother whose
love is quickly won,I say what verily will be,  
  My breast, O mother, and my head and both my hips seem  
   quivering Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012608">8</span></span>Dame with
the lovely hands and arms, with broad hair-plaits  
   and ample hips,  
  Why, O thou hero's wife, art thou angry with our Vrishākapi?  
  Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012609">9</span></span>This noxious
creature looks on me as one bereft of hero's love. <span
id="page_361">p. 361</span>  
  Yet heroes for my sons have I, the Maruts' friend and Indra's  
  Queen Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012610">10</span></span>From olden
time the matron goes to feast and general sacrifice.  
  Mother of heroes, Indra's Queen, the rite's ordainer is extolled.  
  Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012611">11</span></span>So have I
heard Indrāni called most fortunate among these  
   dames,  
  For never shall her Consort die in future time through length  
   of days. Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012612">12</span></span>Never,
Indrāni have I joyed without my friend Vrishākapi,  
  Whose welcome offering here, made pure with water, goeth to  
   the Gods. Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012613">13</span></span>Wealthy
Vrishākapāyi, blest with sons and consorts of thy sons,  
  Indra will eat thy bulls, thy dear oblation that effecteth much.  
  Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012614">14</span></span>Fifteen in
number, then, for me a score of bullocks they  
   prepare.  
  And I devour the fat thereof: they fill my belly full with food.  
  Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012615">15</span></span>Like as a
bull with pointed horn, loud bellowing amid the herds,  
  Sweet to thine heart, O Indra, is the brew which she who tends  
   thee pours. Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012616">16</span></span>Indrāni
speaks. Non ille fortis (ad Venerem) est cujus mentula  
   laxe inter femora dependet; fortis vero estille cujus, quum  
   sederit, membrum pilosum se extendit. Super omnia est  
   Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012617">17</span></span>Indra
speaks. Non fortis est ille cujus, quum sederit, membrum  
   pilosum se extendit: fortis vero est ille cujus mentula laxe  
   inter femora dependet. Super omnia est Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012618">18</span></span>O Indra,
this Vrishākapi hath found a slain wild animal,  
  Dresser, and new-made pan, and knife, and wagon with a load  
   of wood. Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_2012619">19</span></span>Distinguishing the Dāsa and the Arya,
viewing all, I go.  
  I look upon the wise, and drink the simple votary's Soma juice.  
  Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012620">20</span></span>The desert
plains and steep descents, how many leagues in length  
   they spread!  
  Go to the nearest houses, go unto thine home, Vrishākapi.  
  Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012621">21</span></span>Turn thee
again Vrishākapi; we twain will bring thee happiness.  
  Thou goest homeward on thy way along this path which leads  
   to sleep. Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012622">22</span></span>When, Indra
and Vrishākapi, ye travelled upward to your home,  
  Where was that noisome beast, to whom went it, the beast that  
   troubles man? Supreme is Indra over all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012623">23</span></span>Daughter of
Manu, Parsu bare a score of children at a birth. <span id="page_362">p.
362</span>  
  Her portion verily was bliss although her burthen caused her  
   grief.
