### HYMN LXXVI

#### A benediction on a new-born Kshatriya child

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0607601">1</span></span>Those who
are sitting round this babe prepare him to be looked  
   upon.  
  Let Agni thoroughly inflamed with all his tongues rise from his-  
   heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0607602">2</span></span>For length
of life I use the name of Agni the Consuming God,  
  Whose smoke the sage who knows the truth beholds proceeding.  
   from his mouth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0607603">3</span></span>The man who
knows his fuel laid in order by the Kshatriya  
  Sets not his foot upon the steep declivity that leads to Death.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0607604">4</span></span>Those who
encompass slay him not: he goes not near his lurk—  
   ing foes  
  The Kshatriya who, knowing well, takes Agni's name for length  
   of life.
