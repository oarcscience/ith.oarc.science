### HYMN CXLIII

#### Hymn to the Asvins

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2014301">1</span></span>We invocate
this day your car, far-spreading, O Asvins, even  
   the gathering of the sunlight,  
  Car praised in hymns, most ample, rich in treasure, fitted with  
   seats, the car that beareth Sūryā.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2014302">2</span></span>Asvins, ye
gained that glory by your Godhead, ye Sons of  
  Heaven, by your own might and power.  
  Food followeth close upon your bright appearing when stately  
   horses in your chariot draw you.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2014303">3</span></span>Who bringeth
you to-day for help with offered oblations, or with  
   hymns to drink the juices?  
  Who, for the sacrifice's ancient lover, turneth you hither, Asvins,  
   offering homage?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2014304">4</span></span>Borne on
your golden car, ye omnipresent! come to this sacrifice  
   of ours, Nāsatyas.  
  Drink of the pleasant liquor of the Soma: give riches to the  
   people who adore you.<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2014305">5</span></span>Come
hitherward to us from earth, from heaven, borne on your  
   golden chariot rolling lightly.  
  Suffer not other worshippers to stay you: here are ye bound by  
   earlier bonds of friendship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2014306">6</span></span>Now for us
both, mete out, O Wonder-Workers, riches exceed-  
   ing great with store of heroes,  
  Because the men have sent you praise, O Asvins, and Ajamīlhas  
   come to the laudation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2014307">7</span></span>Whene'er I
gratified you here together, your grace was given us,  
  O ye rich in booty.  
  Protect, ye twain, the singer of your praises: to you, Nāsatyas,  
   is my wish directed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2014308">8</span></span>Sweet be the
plants for us, the heavens, the waters, and full of  
   sweets for us be air's mid-region!  
  May the Field's Lord for us be full of sweetness, and may we  
   follow after him uninjured.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2014309">9</span></span>Asvins, that
work of yours deserves our wonder, the Bull of  
   firmament and earth and heaven;  
  Yes, and your thousand promises in battle. Come near to all  
   these men and drink beside us.
