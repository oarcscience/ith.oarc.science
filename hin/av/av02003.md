### HYMN III

#### A water-cure charm

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200301">1</span></span>That little
spring of water which is running downward from the  
   hill  
  I turn to healing balm for thee that thou mayst be good  
   medicine.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200302">2</span></span>Hither and
onward! Well! Come on! Among thy hundred  
   remedies  
  Most excellent of all art thou, curing disease and morbid flow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200303">3</span></span>The Asuras
bury deep in earth this mighty thing that healeth  
   wounds.  
  This is the cure for morbid flow, this driveth malady away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200304">4</span></span>The emmets
from the water-flood produce this healing medicine:  
  This is the cure for morbid flow, this driveth malady away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200305">5</span></span>Mighty is
this wound-healing balm: from out the earth was it  
   produced.  
  This is the cure for morbid flow, this driveth malady away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0200306">6</span></span>Bless us the
Waters! be the Plants auspicious!  
  May Indra's thunderbolt drive off the demons. Far from us fall  
   the shafts they shoot against us!
