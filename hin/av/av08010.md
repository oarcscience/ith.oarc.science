### HYMN X

#### A glorification of the mystical abstraction Virāj

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801001">1</span></span>Viraj at
first was This. At birth all feared her; the thought, She  
   will become this All, struck terror.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801002">2</span></span>She rose,
the Gārhapatya fire she entered. He who knows this  
   becomes lord of a household, performer of domestic sacri-  
   fices.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801003">3</span></span>She mounted
up, the Eastward fire she entered. He who knows  
   this becomes the Gods' beloved, and to his call they come  
   when she invokes them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801004">4</span></span>She mounted
up, the Southward fire she entered.  
  He who knows this becomes a fit performer of sacrifice, meet  
   for honour, shelter-giver.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801005">5</span></span>She mounted
up, she entered the Assembly. He who knows this  
   becomes polite and courtly, and people come as guests to his  
   assembly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801006">6</span></span>She mounted
up, she passed within the meeting. He who knows  
   this becomes fit for the meeting, and to his hall of meeting  
   come the people. <span id="page_a351">p. a351</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801007">7</span></span>She mounted
up, she entered Consultation. Whoso knows this  
   is fit to be consulted, and to his consultation come the  
   people.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801008">8</span></span>She mounted
up, and, into four divided, she took her station in  
   the air's mid-region.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801009">9</span></span>Of her the
Gods and men said, This she knoweth. That we may  
   both have life let us invoke her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801010">10</span></span>Thus did
they cry to her:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801011">11</span></span>Come,
Strength! come, Food! come, Charmer! come, Free-  
   giver!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801012">12</span></span>Her calf,
her well-beloved calf, was Indra: Gāyatri was her  
   rope, the cloud her udder.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801013">13</span></span>Two teats
she had, Rathantara and Brihat, two, Yajnāyajniya  
   and Vāmadevya.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801014">14</span></span>With the
Rathantara the Gods milked from her the Plants, and  
   all the wide expanse with Brihat.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801015">15</span></span>They drew
the Waters forth with Vāmadevya, with Yajnayaj-  
   niya they milked out worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801016">16</span></span>For him who
knoweth this, Rathantara poureth out Plants,  
   and Brihat yieldeth wide expansion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801017">17</span></span>Waters from
Vāmdevya come, from Yajnāyajniya sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801018">18</span></span>She rose,
she came unto the tress: they killed her. A year went  
   by and she again existed.  
  Hence in a year the wounds of trees heal over. He who knows  
   this sees his loathed rival wounded.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801019">19</span></span>She mounted
up, she came unto the Fathers: they killed her:  
   in a month she re-existed.  
  Hence men give monthly offerings to the Fathers: who knows  
   this, knows the path which they have trodden.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801020">20</span></span>She rose,
she came unto the Gods: they killed her: but in a  
   fortnight she again was living.  
  Fortnightly, hence, men serve the Gods with Vasat! Who  
   knows this knows the way which Gods pass over.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801021">21</span></span>She mounted
up, she came to men: they killed her Presently  
   she regained her life and being.  
  Hence on both days to men they bring and offer—who knows  
   this—near-seated in the dwelling.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801022">22</span></span>She rose,
approached the Asuras: they called her: their cry was,  
  Come, O Māyā, come thou hither. <span id="page_a352">p. a352</span>  
  Her dear calf was Virochana Prāhrādi: her milking vessel was a.  
   pan of iron.  
  Dvimūrdhā Ārtvya milked her, yea, this Māyā, The Asuras  
   depend for life on Māyā. He who knows this becomes a fit  
   supporter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801023">23</span></span>She mounted
up, she came unto the Fathers. The Fathers called.  
   to her, O Food, come hither.  
  King Yama was her calf, her pail was silvern. Antaka, Mrityu's.  
   son, milked her, this Svadhā.  
  This Food the Fathers make their lives' sustainer. He who•  
   knows this becomes a meet supporter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801024">24</span></span>She mounted
up, she came to men. They called her, Come unto-  
   us, come hither thou Free-giver!  
  Earth was her milking-pail, the calf beside her Manu Vaivasvata,  
  Vivasvān's offspring.  
  Prithi the son of Vena was her milker: he milked forth hus-  
   bandry and grain for sowing.  
  These men depend for life on corn and tillage. He who knows  
   this becomes a meet supporter, successful in the culture of his\_  
   corn-land.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801025">25</span></span>She rose,
she came unto the Seven Rishis. They called her,.  
  Come, Rich in Devotion! hither.  
  King Soma was her calf. the Moon her milk-pail. Brihaspati.  
  Āngirasa, her milker,  
  Drew from her udder Prayer and Holy Fervour. Fervour and  
  Prayer maintain the Seven Rishis.  
  He who knows this becomes a meet supporter, a priest illustri-  
   ous for his sacred knowledge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801026">26</span></span>She rose,
she came unto the Gods. They called her, crying, O  
  Vigour, come to us, come hither!  
  God Savitar milked her, he milked forth Vigour. The Gods  
   depend for life upon that Vigour. He who knows this becomes  
   a meet supporter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801027">27</span></span>She rose
approached the Apsarases and Gandharvas. They called  
   her, Come to us, O Fragrant-scented!  
  The son of Sūryavarchas, Chitraratha, was her dear calf, her pail.  
   a lotus-petal.  
  The son of Sūryavarchas, Vasuruchi, milked and drew from her  
   most delightful fragrance.  
  That scent supports Apsarases and Gandharvas. He who knows <span
id="page_a353">p. a353</span>  
   this becomes a meet supporter, and round him ever breathes  
   delicious odour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801028">28</span></span>She mounted
up, she came to Other People. They called her,  
   crying, Come, Concealment! hither.  
  Her dear calf was Vaisravana Kubera, a vessel never tempered  
   was her milk-pail.  
  Rajatanābhi, offspring of Kubera, milked her, and from her  
   udder drew concealment.  
  By that concealment live the Other People. He who knows this  
   becomes a meet supporter, and makes all evil disappear and  
   vanish.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801029">29</span></span>She mounted
up, she came unto the Serpents. The Serpents  
   called her, Venomous! come hither.  
  Her calf was Takshaka, Visāla's offspring: a bottlegourd suppli-  
   ed a milking-vessel.  
  Irāvān's offspring, Dhritarāshtra milked her, and from her udder  
   drew forth only poison.  
  That poison quickens and supports the Serpents: He who knows  
   this becomes a meet supporter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801030">30</span></span>One would
ward off, for him who hath this knowledge, if with a  
   bottle-gourd he sprinkled water.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801031">31</span></span>And did he
not repel, if in his spirit he said, I drive thee back,  
   he would repel it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801032">32</span></span>The poison
that it drives away, that poison verily repels.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0801033">33</span></span>The man who
hath this knowledge pours its venom on his hated  
   foe.
