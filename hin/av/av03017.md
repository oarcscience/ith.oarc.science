### HYMN XVII

#### A farmer's song and prayer to speed the plough

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301701">1</span></span>Wise and
devoted to the Gods the skilful men bind plough-ropes  
   fast, <span id="page_a86">p. a86</span>  
  And lay the yokes on either side.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301702">2</span></span>Lay on the
yokes and fasten well the traces: formed is the  
   furrow, sow the seed within it.  
  Virāj vouchsafe us hearing fraught with plenty!  
  Let the ripe grain come near and near the sickle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301703">3</span></span>The
keen-shared plough that bringeth bliss, furnished with traces  
   and with stilts,  
  Shear out for me a cow, a sheep, a rapid drawer of the car, a  
   blooming woman, plump and strong!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301704">4</span></span>May Indra
press the furrow down, may Pūshan guard and cherish  
   her.  
  May she, well stored with milk yield milk for us through each  
   succeeding year.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301705">5</span></span>Happily let
the shares turn up the ploughland, the ploughers  
   happily follow the oxen.  
  Pleased with our sacrifice, Suna and Sira! make the plants bring  
   this man abundant produce.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301706">6</span></span>Happily work
our steers and men! May the plough furrow  
   happily,  
  Happily be the traces bound. Happily ply the driving-goad.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301707">7</span></span>Suna and
Sira, welcome ye this laud, and with the milk that ye  
   have made in heaven,  
  Bedew ye both this earth of ours.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301708">8</span></span>Auspicious
Sitā, come thou near: we venerate and worship thee.  
  That thou mayst bless and prosper us and bring us fruits  
   abundantly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301709">9</span></span>Loved by the
Visvedevas and the Maruts, let Sitā be bedewed.  
   with oil and honey.  
  Turn thou to us with wealth of milk, O Sitā, in vigorous  
   strength and pouring streams of fatness.
