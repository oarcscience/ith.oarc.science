### HYMN IX

#### Enunciation of mystico-theological and cosmological doctrine

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900901">1</span></span>The second
brother of this lovely Hotar, hoary with eld, is the  
   voracious Lightning.  
  The third is he whose back is balmed with butter. Here have I  
   seen the King with seven male children.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900902">2</span></span>The seven
make the one-wheeled chariot ready: bearing seven  
   names the single Courser draws it.  
  The wheel, three-naved, is sound and undecaying: thereon these  
   worlds of life are all dependent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900903">3</span></span>The seven
who on this seven-wheeled car are mounted have  
   horses, seven in tale, who draw them onward.  
  Seven sisters utter songs of praise together, in whom the Cows'  
   seven names are held and treasured.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900904">4</span></span>Who hath
beheld at birth the Primal Being, when She who hath  
   no bone supports the bony?  
  Where is the blood of earth, the life, the spirit? Who may ap-  
   proach the man who knows, to ask it?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900905">5</span></span>Let him who
knoweth presently declare it, this lovely Bird's  
   securely-founded station.  
  Forth from his head the Cows draw milk, and wearing his ves-  
   ture with their foot have drunk the water.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900906">6</span></span>Unripe in
mind, in spirit undiscerning, I ask of these the Gods'  
   established places.  
  High up above the yearling Calf the sages, to form a web, their  
   own seven threads have woven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900907">7</span></span>Here,
ignorant, I ask the wise who know it, as one who knows  
   not, for the sake of knowledge,  
  What is That One, who in the Unborn's image hath stablished  
   and fixed firm this world's six regions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900908">8</span></span>The Mother
gave the Sire his share of Order. With thought at  
   first she wedded him in spirit.  
  She, coyly loth, was filled with dew prolific. With adoration  
   men approached to praise her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900909">9</span></span>Yoked was
the Mother to the boon Cow's car-pole; in humid  
   folds of cloud the infant rested.  
  Then the Calf lowed and looked upon the Mother, the Cow  
   who wears all shapes in three directions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900910">10</span></span>Bearing
three mothers and three fathers, single he stood erect:  
   they never made him weary. <span id="page_a383">p. a383</span>  
  On yonder heaven's high ridge they speak together in speech  
   not known to all, themselves all-knowing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900911">11</span></span>Upon the
five-spoked wheel revolving ever, whereon all crea-  
   tures rest and are dependent,  
  The axle, heavy-laden, is not heated: the nave from ancient  
   time remains unheated.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900912">12</span></span>They call
him in the farther half of heaven the Sire five-footed,  
   of twelve forms, wealthy in watery store.  
  These others, later still, say that he takes his stand upon a seven-  
   wheeled car, six-spoked, whose sight is clear.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900913">13</span></span>Formed with
twelve spokes, too strong for age to weaken, this  
   wheel of during Order rolls round heaven.  
  Herein established, joined in pairs together, seven hundred sons  
   and twenty stand, O Agni.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900914">14</span></span>The wheel
revolves, unwasting, with its felly: ten draw it, yoked  
   to the far-stretching car-pole.  
  Girt by the region moves the eye of Sūrya, on whom dependent  
   rest all living creatures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900915">15</span></span>They told
me these were males, though truly females. He who  
   hath eyes sees this, the blind discerns not.  
  The son who is a sage hath comprehended: who knows this  
   rightly is his father's father.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900916">16</span></span>Of the
co-born they call the seventh single-born: the six twin,  
   pairs are called the Rishis, sons of Gods.  
  Their good gifts sought of men are ranged in order due, and,  
   various, form by form, move for their guiding Lord.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900917">17</span></span>Beneath the
upper realm, above this lower, bearing her Calf at  
   foot, the Cow hath risen.  
  Whitherward, to what place hath she departed? Where doth she  
   calve? Not in this herd of cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900918">18</span></span>Who, that
the father of this Calf discerneth beneath the upper  
   realm, above the lower,  
  Showing himself a sage, may here declare him? Whence hath  
   the godlike spirit had its rising?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900919">19</span></span>Those that
come hitherward they call departing, those that depart  
   they call directed hither.  
  Whatever ye have made, Indra and Soma! steeds draw, as' twere,  
   yoked to the region's car-pole.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900920">20</span></span>Two Birds
with fair wings, knit with bonds of friendship, in the  
   same sheltering tree have found a refuge, <span id="page_a384">p.
a384</span>  
  One of the twain eats the sweet Fig-tree's berry: the other, eat-  
   ing not, regardeth only.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900921">21</span></span>The tree
whereon the fine Birds eat the sweetness, where they  
   all rest and procreate their offspring  
  Upon the top, they say the fruit is luscious: none gaineth it who  
   knoweth not the Father.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900922">22</span></span>Where the
fine birds hymn ceaselessly their portion of life eter-  
   nal, and the sacred synods.  
  There is the Universe's Guard and Keeper who, wise hath  
   entered into me the simple.
