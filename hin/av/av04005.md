### HYMN V

#### A lover's sleep-charm

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400501">1</span></span>The Bull who
hath a thousand horns, who rises up from out the  
   sea,  
  By him the strong and mighty one we lull the folk to rest and.  
   sleep.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400502">2</span></span>Over the
surface of the earth there breathes no wind, there looks.  
   no eye.  
  Lull all the women, lull the dogs to sleep, with Indra as thy  
   friend!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400503">3</span></span>The woman
sleeping in the court, lying without, or stretched on  
   beds,  
  The matrons with their odorous sweets—these, one and all, we  
   lull to sleep.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400504">4</span></span>Each moving
thing have I secured, have held and held the eye  
   and breath.  
  Each limb and member have I seized in the deep darkness of  
   the night.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400505">5</span></span>The man who
sits, the man who walks, whoever stands and clearly  
   sees  
  Of these we closely shut the eyes, even as we closely shut this  
   house.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400506">6</span></span>Sleep
mother, let the father sleep, sleep dog, and master of the  
   home.  
  Let all her kinsmen sleep, sleep all the people who are round  
   about.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400507">7</span></span>With
soporific charm, O Sleep, lull thou to slumber all the folk.  
  Let the rest sleep till break of day, I will remain awake till  
   dawn, like Indra free from scath and harm.
