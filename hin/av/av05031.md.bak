### HYMN XXXI

#### A counter-charm against the incantations of an enemy

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503101">1</span></span>The spell
that they have cast for thee on unbaked dish or ming-  
   led meal, <span id="page_a197">p. a197</span>  
  The witchcraft wrought on undressed meat, this I strike back  
   again on them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503102">2</span></span>The spell
that they have cast for thee on jungle-cock, goat,  
   horned ram,  
  The witchcraft wrought upon thy ewe, this I strike back again  
   on them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503103">3</span></span>The spell
that they have cast upon thy beast that hath uncloven  
   hooves,  
  The ass with teeth in both his jaws, this I strike back again on  
   them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503104">4</span></span>The secret
spell upon thy plants Amūlā or Narāchi, spell  
  That they have cast upon thy field, this I strike back again on  
   them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503105">5</span></span>The spell
that wicked men have cast on thine original household-  
   fire,  
  And on thy sacrificial hall, this I strike back again on them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503106">6</span></span>The spell
that they have cast upon thy public room thy gambl-  
   ing-board,  
  Spell they have cast upon thy dice, this I strike back again on  
   them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503107">7</span></span>The spell
that they have cast upon thine army or thy shafts and  
   arms,  
  Spell they have cast upon the drum, this I throw back again on  
   them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503108">8</span></span>Charm they
have laid within thy well or buried in the burning-  
   ground,  
  Charm they have laid within thy home, this I throw back again  
   on them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503109">9</span></span>The spell
that they have wrought for thee in flickering fire of  
   human bones,—  
  Mroka, consuming, cannibal, this I throw back again on them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503110">10</span></span>He brought
this by no proper path, by the right path we drive it  
   back.  
  The fool in folly brought it to those who observe established  
   bounds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503111">11</span></span>No power
had he who wrought the spell: he hurt his foot, he  
   broke his toe.  
  Unlucky for his wealthy lords, he hath wrought happiness for us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503112">12</span></span>May Indra
slay with mighty bolt, may Agni with his missible  
   pierce. <span id="page_a198">p. a198</span>  
  The sorcerer who brings the curse, who deals with roots and  
   secret spells.
