### HYMN V

#### A glorification of sacrifice

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700501">1</span></span>The Gods
adored the Sacrifice with worship: these were the  
   statutes of primeval ages.  
  Those mighty ones attained the cope of heaven, there where the  
  Sādhyas, Gods of old, are dwelling.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700502">2</span></span>Sacrifice
was, was manifest among us: it sprang to life and then  
   in time grew stronger.  
  Then it became thedeities' lord and ruler: may it bestow on us  
   abundant riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700503">3</span></span>Where the
Gods worshipped Gods with their oblation, worship-  
   ped immortals with immortal spirit, <span id="page_a272">p.
a272</span>  
  There in the loftiest heaven may we be happy, and look upon  
   that light when Sūrya rises.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700504">4</span></span>With their
oblation, Purusha, the Gods performed a sacrifice.  
  A sacrifice more potent still they paid with the invoking hymn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700505">5</span></span>With dog the
Gods, perplexed, have paid oblation, and with  
   cow's limbs in sundry sacrifices.  
  Invoke for us, in many a place declare him who with his mind.  
   hath noticed this our worship.
