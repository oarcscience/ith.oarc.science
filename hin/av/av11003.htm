Of that Odana Brihaspati is the head, Brahma the mouth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1100302">2</A></FONT></span>2. Heaven and Earth are the ears, the Sun and Moon are the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes, the seven Rishis are the vital airs inhaled and exhaled. <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Vision is the pestle, Desire the mortar. 4. Diti is the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;winnowing basket, Aditi is she who holds it, V&#257;ta is the sifter.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Horses are the grains, oxen the winnowed ricegrains, gnats<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the husks. 6. Kabru is the husked grain, the rain cloud is the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reed. 7. Grey iron is its flesh, copper its blood. 8. Tin is its<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashes, gold its colour, the blue lotus flower its scent. 9. The<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threshing-floor is its dish, the wooden swords its shoulders,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the car-shafts its backbones. 10. Collar-bones are its entrails,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;straps its intestines. 11. This earth, verily becomes the jar,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and heaven the cover of the Odana as it is cooking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12. Furrows are its ribs, sandy soils the undigested contents<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of its stomach. 13. Law is its water for the hands and family<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;custom its aspersion. 14. The jar covered with the Rich has<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been solemnly directed by the priestly office. 15. Received by<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Br&#257;hman, it has been carried round. 16. The Brihat is,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stirring-spoon, the Rathantara the ladle. 17. The Seasons<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are the dressers, the Groups of Seasons kindle the fire.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18. The caldron flames round the oblation (<i>charu</i>) whose<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth consists of five openings.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1100319">19</A></FONT></span>19. The sacrificial word, all worlds are to be won with Odana.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1100320">20</A></FONT></span>20. Whereon in order rest the three, the ocean, and the heaven, and<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1100321">21</A></FONT></span>21.

I ask thee, of this Odana what is the mighty magnitude.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1100323">23</A></FONT></span>23. He who may know the magnitude of the Odana. 24. Would say,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Not small, nor devoid of moistening sauce; not this, nor any-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing whatever. 25. He would not declare it to be greater than<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the giver imagines it to be. 26. The theologians say, Thou<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast eaten the averted Odana and the Odana turned hither-<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ward. 27. Thou hast eaten the Odana and the Odana will eat<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee. 28. Thou hast eaten this averted; thy inward breath will<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave thee; so he said to this one. 29. Thou hast eaten this<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned hitherward; thy downward breath will leave thee; so<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said to this one. 30. I indeed have not eaten the Odana,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor has the Odana eaten me. 31. The Odana has just eaten<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Odana.</p>  <h4 align="center">2</h4>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_1100332">32</A></FONT></span>32. And thence he said to this one, Thou hast eaten this with a<a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></A><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;different head from that with which the ancient Rishis ate:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy offspring, reckoning from the eldest, will die. I have eaten<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it neither turned downward, nor turned away, nor turned<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hitherward. With Brihaspati as head: with him I have eaten,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with him have I come to it. Now this Odana is complete with<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all members, joints, and body. Complete, verily, with all his<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members, joints, and body is he who possess this knowledge.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33. And thence he said to him, Thou hast eaten this with<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other ears than those with which the ancient Rishis ate it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt be deaf. I have eaten it neither, etc. (as in verse 32).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Heaven and Earth as ears, with these I have eaten it,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with these I have come to it. Now this Odana, etc. (as in 32).<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;34. And thence he said to him. Thou hast eaten this with<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other eyes . . . thou wilt be blind. With Sun and Moon, etc.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35. And thence, etc. . . with other month. Thy offspring will<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die, reckoning from the head . . .

And thence, etc. . . . with other vital<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;airs. . . . Thy vital airs will leave thee . . . With the Seven<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rishis as the vital airs. 39. And thence, etc. . . . with other<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expanse . . . Consumption will destroy thee . . . With the<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firmament as expanse. 40 And thence, etc. . . . with other<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back. . . . Lightning will slay thee. . . With the heaven as<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back. 41. And thence, etc. . . . with other breast . . . Thou<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilt fail in agriculture. . . . With the earth as breast. 42. And<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thence, etc. . . . with other belly . . . colic will destroy thee . . .<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With truth as belly. 43. And thence, etc. . . . with other<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abdomen . . . Thou wilt die in the water . . . With the sea as<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abdomen. 44.

Thou wilt become a<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wanderer . . . With the feet of the Asvins. 47. And thence,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;etc. . . with other fore-parts of the feet . . . A serpent will<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill thee . . . With the fore-parts of Savitar's feet. 48. And<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thence, etc. . . . with other hands . . .

Without standing-ground<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and resting-place thou wilt die . . . Having taken my stand on<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth. With this I ate it, with this I came to it. Now this<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odana is complete with all members, joints, and body.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complete, verily, with all his members, joints, and body is he<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who possesses this knowledge.</p>
