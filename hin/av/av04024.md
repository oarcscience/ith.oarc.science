### HYMN XXIV

#### A hymn of prayer and praise to Indra

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402401">1</span></span>I think of
Indra, only him for ever, fiend-slayer, May these lauds  
   of mine come near him.  
  He cometh to the pious offerer's calling. May he deliver us from  
   grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402402">2</span></span>Who with
strong arms o'ercame his strong opponents, who  
   broke and crushed the power of the demons,  
  Who won the rivers and the kine in battle. May he deliver us  
   from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402403">3</span></span>Ruler of
men, finder of light, the hero: the pressing-stones  
   declare his valour, master.  
  Of sweetest sacrifice with seven Hotars. May he deliver us from  
   grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402404">4</span></span>The lord of
barren cows and bulls and oxen, finder of light for  
   whom the posts are planted,  
  For whom the bright juice flows cleansed by devotion. May he  
   deliver us from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402405">5</span></span>Whose favour
those desire who offer Soma, whom, arrow-bearer,  
   men invoke in battle,  
  On whom the hymn depends, in whom is power, May he deliver  
   us from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402406">6</span></span>Why was
born, first, for active operation, whose valour as the  
   first hath been awakened,  
  Who raised his bolt when he encountered Ahi. May he deliver us  
   from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402407">7</span></span>Strong Lord,
who leadeth hosts to meet for battle, who sendeth  
   riches both of earth and heaven,  
  I, suppliant, praise and ever call on Indra. May he deliver us  
   from grief and trouble.
