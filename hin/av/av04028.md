### HYMN XXVIII

#### A hymn to Bhava and Sarva

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402801">1</span></span>I Reverence
you—mark this—Bhava and Sarva, ye under whose  
   control is this that shineth.  
  Lords of this world both quadruped and biped. Deliver us, ye  
   twain, from grief and trouble. <span id="page_a137">p. a137</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402802">2</span></span>Lords of all
near and even of what is distant, famed as the best  
   and skilfullest of archers,  
  Lords of this world both quadruped and biped, Deliver us, ye  
   twain, from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0402803">3</span></span>Thousand-eyed foe-destroyers, I invoke
you, still praising you  
   the strong, of wide dominion:  
  Lords of this world both quadruped and biped, Deliver us, ye  
   twain, from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402804">4</span></span>Ye who of
old wrought many a deed in concert, and showed  
   among mankind unhappy omens;  
  Lords of this world both quadruped and biped, Deliver us, ye  
   twain, from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402805">5</span></span>Ye from the
stroke of whose destroying weapon not one among  
   the Gods or men escapeth,  
  Lords of this world both quadruped and biped, Deliver us, ye  
   twain, from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402806">6</span></span>Hurl your
bolt, strong Gods, at the Yātudhāna, him who makes  
   ready roots and deals in magic:  
  Lords of this world both quadruped and biped, Deliver us, ye  
   twain, from grief and trouble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402807">7</span></span>Comfort and
aid us, ye strong Gods, in battles, at each Kimidin  
   send your bolt of thunder.  
  I, suppliant, praise and ever call on Bhav and Sarva. Set us free  
   from grief and trouble.
