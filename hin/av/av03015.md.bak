### HYMN XV

#### A merchant's prayer for success in his business

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301501">1</span></span>I stir and
animate the merchant Indra; may he approach and  
   be our guide and leader. <span id="page_a83">p. a83</span>  
  Chasing ill-will, wild beast, and highway robber, may he who  
   hath the power give me riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301502">2</span></span>The many
paths which Gods are wont to travel, the paths which  
   go between the earth and heaven,  
  May they rejoice with me in milk and fatness that I may make  
   rich profit by my purchase.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301503">3</span></span>With fuel.
Agni! and with butter, longing, mine offering I  
   present for strength and conquest;  
  With prayer, so far as I have strength, adoring—this holy hymn  
   to gain a hundred treasures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301504">4</span></span>Pardon this
stubbornness of ours. O Agni, the distant pathway  
   which our feet have trodden.  
  Propitious unto us be sale and barter, may interchange of mer-  
   chandise enrich me.  
  Accept, ye twain, accordant, this libation! Prosperous be our  
   ventures and incomings.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301505">5</span></span>The wealth
wherewith I carry on my traffic, seeking, ye Gods!  
   wealth with the wealth I offer,  
  May this grow more for me, not less: O Agni, through sacrifice  
   chase those who hinder profit!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301506">6</span></span>The wealth
wherewith I carry on my traffic, seeking, ye Gods!  
   wealth with the wealth I offer,  
  Herein may Indra, Savitar, and Soma, Prajāpati, and Agni give  
   me splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301507">7</span></span>With
reverence we sign thy praise, O Hotar-priest Vaisvānara.  
  Over our children keep thou watch, over our bodies, kine, and  
   lives.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301508">8</span></span>Still to
thee ever will we bring oblation, as to a stabled horse, O  
  Jātavedas.  
  Joying in food and in the growth of riches may we thy servants,  
  Agni, never suffer.
