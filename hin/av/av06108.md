### HYMN CVIII

#### A prayer for wisdom

<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0610801">1</span></span>Intelligence, come first to us with store
of horses and of kine!  
  Thou with the rays of Sūrya art our worshipful and holy one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0610802">2</span></span>The first,
devout Intelligence, lauded by sages, sped by prayer,  
  Drunk by Brahmachāris, for the favour of the Gods I call.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0610803">3</span></span>That
excellent Intelligence which Ribhus know, and Asuras,  
  Intelligence which sages know, we cause to enter into me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0610804">4</span></span>Do thou, O
Agni, make me wise this day with that Intelligence.  
  Which the creative ishis, which the men endowed with wisdom  
   knew.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0610805">5</span></span>Intelligence
at eve, at morn, Intelligence at noon of day,  
  With the Sun's beams, and by our speech we plant in us  
  Intelligence.
