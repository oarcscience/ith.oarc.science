### HYMN XXII

#### A charm against fever

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502201">1</span></span>Hence,
filled with holy strength let Agni, Soma, and Varuna,  
   the Press-stone, and the Altar.  
  And Grass, and glowing Fuel banish Fever. Let hateful things  
   stay at a distance yonder.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502202">2</span></span>And thou
thyself who makest all men yellow, consuming them  
   with burning heat like Agni,  
  Thou, Fever! then be weak and ineffective. Pass hence into the  
   realms below or vanish.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502203">3</span></span>Endowed with
universal power! send Fever down-ward, far  
   away,  
  The spotty, like red-coloured dust, sprung from a spotty  
   ancestor.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502204">4</span></span>When I have
paid obeisance to Fever I send him downward  
   forth.  
  So let Sakambhara's boxer go again to the Mahāvrishas.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502205">5</span></span>His mansions
are the Mūjavans, and the Mahāvrishas his home,  
  Thou, Fever, ever since thy birth hast lived among the Bahlikas.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502206">6</span></span>Fever,
snake, limbless one, speak out! Keep thyself far away  
   fi om us.  
  Seek thou a wanton Dāst girl and strike her with thy thunder-  
   bolt.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502207">7</span></span>Go, Fever,
to the Mūjavans, or, farther, to the Bahlikas.  
  Seek a lascivious Sara girl and seem to shake her through and  
   through.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502208">8</span></span>Go hence and
eat thy kinsmen the Mahāvrishas and Mūjavans.  
  These or those foreign regions we proclaim to Fever for his  
   home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502209">9</span></span>In a strange
land thou joyest not; subdued, thou wilt be kind  
   to us.  
  Fever is eager to depart, and to the Bahlikas will go,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502210">10</span></span>Since thou
now cold, now burning hot, with cough besides, hast  
   made us shake,  
  Terrible, Fever, are thy darts: forbear to injure us with these.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502211">11</span></span>Take none
of these to be thy friends, Cough, or Consumption  
   or Decline:  
  Never come thence again to us! O Fever, thus I counsel thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502212">12</span></span>Go, Fever,
with Consumption, thy brother, and with thy sister,  
  Cough. <span id="page_a184">p. a184</span>  
  And with thy nephew Herpes, go away unto that alien folk.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502213">13</span></span>Chase Fever
whether cold or hot, brought by the summer or  
   the rains,  
  Tertian, intermittent, or autumnal, or continual.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502214">14</span></span>We to
Gandhāris, Mūjavans, to Angas and to Magadhas.  
  Hand over Fever as it were a servant and a thing of price.
