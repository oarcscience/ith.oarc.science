### HYMN II

#### A glorification of Indra

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500201">1</span></span>In all the
worlds That was the best and highest whence sprang  
   the Mighty One of splendid valour.  
  As soon as born he overcomes his foemen, when those rejoice in  
   him who bring him succour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500202">2</span></span>Grown mighty
in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe  
   strikes fear into the Dāsa,  
  Eager to win the breathing and the breathless: All sang thy  
   praise at banquet and oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500203">3</span></span>All
concentrate on thee their mental vigour what time these,  
   twice or thrice, are thine assistants,  
  Blend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness win quickly  
   with our meath that meath in battle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500204">4</span></span>If verily in
every war the sages joy and exult in thee who win-  
   nest treasures,  
  With mightier power, strong God, extend thy firmness: let not  
   malevolent Kaokas harm thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500205">5</span></span>Proudly we
put our trust in thee in battles, when we behold  
   great wealth the prize of combat.  
  I with my words impel thy weapons onward, and sharpen with  
   my prayer thy vital vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500206">6</span></span>Thou in that
house, the highest or the lowest, which thy protec-  
   tion guards, bestowest riches.  
  Establish ye the ever-wandering mother, and bring full many  
   deeds to their completion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500207">7</span></span>Praise in
the height Him who hath many pathways, courageous,  
   strongest, Aptya of the Aptyas  
  Through strength he shows himself of ample power: pattern of  
  Prithivī, he fights and conquers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500208">8</span></span>Brihaddiva,
the foremost of light-winners, hath made these holy  
   prayers, this strength for Indra. <span id="page_a156">p.
a156</span>  
  Free Lord, he rules the mighty fold of cattle, winning, aglow,  
   even all the billowy waters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500209">9</span></span>Thus hath
Brihaddiva, the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as  
   himself in person.  
  Two sisters free from stain, the Mātarivans, with power impel  
   him onward and exalt him.
