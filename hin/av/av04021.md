### HYMN XXI

#### Glorification and benediction of cows

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402101">1</span></span>The kine
have come and brought good fortune: let them rest in  
   the cow-pen and be happy near us.  
  Here let them stay prolific, many-coloured, and yield through  
   many morns their milk for Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402102">2</span></span>Indra aids
him who offers sacrifice and praise: he takes not what  
   is his, and gives him more thereto.  
  Increasing ever more and ever more his wealth, he makes the  
   pious dwell within unbroken bounds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402103">3</span></span>These are
ne'er lost, no robber ever injures them: no evil-minded  
   foe attempts to harass them.  
  The master of the kine lives a long life with these, the Cows  
   whereby he pours his gifts and serves the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402104">4</span></span>The charger
with his dusty brow o'ertakes them not, and never  
   to the shambles do they take their way.  
  These Cows, the cattle of the pious worshipper, roam over wide-  
   spread pasture where no danger is.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402105">5</span></span>To me the
Cows seem Bhaga, they seem Indra, they seem a  
   portion of the first poured Soma.  
  These present Cows, they, O ye men, are Indra. I long for Indra  
   with my heart and spirit.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402106">6</span></span>O Cows, ye
fatten e'en the worn and wasted, and make the  
   unlovely beautiful to look on.  
  Prosper my home, ye with auspicious voices! Your power is  
   magnified in our assemblies.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402107">7</span></span>In goodly
pasturage, bright-hued, prolific, drinking pure water at  
   fair drinking-places,  
  Never be thief or sinful man your master, and may the dart of  
  Rudra still avoid you!
