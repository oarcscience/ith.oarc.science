### HYMN IV

#### A benediction at the election of a king

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300401">1</span></span>To thee hath
come the kingship with its splendour: On! shine  
   as lord, sole ruler of the people.  
  King! let all regions of the heavens invite thee. Here let men  
   wait on thee and bow before thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300402">2</span></span>The
tribesmen shall elect thee for the Kingship, these five celestial  
   regions shall elect thee.  
  Rest on the height and top of kingly power: thence as a mighty  
   man award us treasures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300403">3</span></span>Kinsmen,
inviting thee, shall go to meet thee, with thee go  
  Agni as an active herald.  
  Let women and their sons be friendly-minded. Thou mighty one,  
   shalt see abundant tribute.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300404">4</span></span>First shall
the Asvins, Varuna and Mitra, the Universal Gods,  
   and Maruts call thee.  
  Then turn thy mind to giving gifts of treasures, thence, mighty  
   one, distribute wealth among us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300405">5</span></span>Speed to us
hither from the farthest distance. Propitious unto  
   thee be Earth and Heaven.  
  Even so hath Varuna this King asserted, he who himself hath  
   called thee: come thou hither.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300406">6</span></span>Pass to the
tribes of men. O Indra, Indra. Thou the Varunas  
   hast been found accordant.  
  To his own place this one hath called thee, saying, Let him adore  
   the Gods and guide the clansmen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300407">7</span></span>The
Bounteous Paths in sundry forms and places,  
   all in accord, have given thee room and comfort.  
  Let all of these in concert call thee hither. Live thy tenth decade  
   here, a strong kind ruler.
