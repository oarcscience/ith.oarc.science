### HYMN VI

#### A prayer to Aditi for help and protection

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700601">1</span></span>Aditi is
sky, and air's mid-region, Aditi is the father, son, and  
   mother,  
  Aditi all the Gods and the Five Nations, Aditi what is now and  
   what is future.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700602">2</span></span>We call for
help the Queen of Law and Order, great mother of  
   all those whose ways are righteous,  
  Far-spread, unwasting strong in her dominion, Aditi wisely lead-  
   ing, well protecting. <span id="page_a273">p. a273</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700603">3</span></span>Sinless may
we ascend, for weal, the vessel, rowed with good  
   oars, divine, that never leaketh,  
  Earth, our strong guard, incomparable Heaven, Aditi wisely lead-  
   ing, well protecting.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700604">4</span></span>Let us bring
hither, in pursuit of riches, Aditi with our word,  
   the mighty mother,  
  Her in whose lap the spacious air is lying: may she afford us  
   triply-guarding shelter!
