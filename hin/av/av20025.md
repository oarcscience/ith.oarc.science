### HYMN XXV

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002501">1</span></span>Indra, the
mortal man well guarded by thine aid goes foremost  
   in the wealth of horses and of kine.  
  With amplest wealth thou fillest him, as round about the waters  
   clearly seen afar fill Sindhu full.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002502">2</span></span>The heavenly
waters come not nigh the priestly bowl: they but  
   look down and see how far mid-air is spread:  
  The Deities conduct the pious man to them: like suitors they  
   delight in him who loveth prayer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002503">3</span></span>Praiseworthy
blessing hast thou laid upon the pair who with  
   uplifted ladle serve thee, man and wife.  
  Unchecked he dwells and prospers in thy law: thy power brings  
   blessing to the sacrificer pouring gifts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002504">4</span></span>First the
Angirases won themselves vital power, whose fires were  
   kindled through good deeds and sacrifice.  
  The men together found the Pani's hoarded wealth, the cattle,  
   and the wealth in horses and in kine,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002505">5</span></span>Atharvan
first by sacrifices laid the path; then, guardian of the  
  Law, sprang up the loving Sun.  
  Usanā Kāvya drove the kine hither with him: let us with offer-  
   ings honour Yama's deathless birth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002506">6</span></span>When sacred
grass is trimmed to aid the auspicious work, or  
   the hymn makes its voice of praise sound to the sky,  
  Where the stone rings as 'twere a singer skilled in laud,—Indra  
   in truth delights when these come near to him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2002507">7</span></span>To make thee
start, a strong true draught I offer to thee the  
  Bull, O thou whom bay steeds carry.  
  Here take delight. O Indra, in our voices while thou art hymned  
   with power and all our spirit.
