### HYMN XXV

#### A man's love-charm

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302501">1</span></span>Let the
Impeller goad thee on. Rest not in peace upon thy bed.  
  Terrible is the shaft of Love: therewith I pierce thee to the  
   heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302502">2</span></span>That arrow
winged with longing thought, its stem Desire, its  
   neck, Resolve,  
  Let Kāma, having truly aimed, shoot forth and pierce thee in  
   the heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302503">3</span></span>The shaft of
Kāma, pointed well, that withers and consumes the  
   spleen.  
  With hasty feathers, all aglow, therewith I pierce thee to the  
   heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302504">4</span></span>Pierced
through with fiercely-burning heat, steal to me with thy  
   parching lips,  
  Gentle and humble, all mine own, devoted, with sweet words of  
   love.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302505">5</span></span>Away Lfrom
mother and from sire I drive thee hither with a  
   whip,  
  That thou mayst be at my command and yield to every wish of  
   mine. <span id="page_a97">p. a97</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302506">6</span></span>Mitra and
Varuna, expel all thought and purpose from her  
   heart.  
  Deprive her of her own free will and make her subject unto me.
