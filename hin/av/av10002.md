### HYMN II

#### Purusha, Primeval Man or humanity personified

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000201">1</span></span>Who framed
the heels of Pūrusha? Who fashioned the flesh of  
   him? Who formed and fixed his ankles?  
  Who made the openings and well-moulded fingers? Who gave  
   him foot-soles and a central station?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000202">2</span></span>Whence did
they make the ankles that are under, and the knee-  
   bones of Pūrusha above them?  
  What led them onward to the legs' construction? Who planned  
   and formed the knees' articulations?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000203">3</span></span>A fourfold
frame is fixt with ends connected, and up above the  
   knees a yielding belly.  
  The hips and thighs, who was their generator, those props where-  
   by the trunk grew firmly stablished?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000204">43</span></span>Who and how
many were those Gods who fastened the chest of  
  Pūrusha and neck together?  
  How many fixed his breasts? Who formed his elbows? How  
   many joined together ribs and shoulders?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000205">5</span></span>Who put
together both his arms and said, Let him show manly  
   strength?  
  Who and what God was he who set the shoulderblades upon  
   the trunk?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000206">6</span></span>Who pierced
the seven openings in the head? Who made these  
   ears, these nostrils, eyes, and mouth,  
  Through whose surpassing might in all directions bipeds and  
   quadrupeds have power of motion?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000207">7</span></span>He set
within the jaws the tongue that reaches far, and thereon  
   placed Speech the mighty Goddess.  
  He wanders to and fro mid living creatures, robed in the waters.  
  Who hath understood it?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000208">8</span></span>Who was he,
first, of all the Gods who fashioned his skull and  
   brain and occiput and forehead,  
  The pile that Pūrusha's two jaws supported? Who was that  
  God who mounted up to heaven?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000209">9</span></span>Whence
bringeth mighty Pūrusha both pleasant and unpleasant  
   things,  
  Of varied sort, sleep, and alarm, fatigue, enjoyments and de-  
   lights?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000210">10</span></span>Whence is
there found in Pūrusha want, evil, suffering, dis-  
   tress? <span id="page_6">p. 6</span>  
  Whence come success, prosperity opulence, thought, and utte-  
   rance?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000211">11</span></span>Who stored
in him floods turned in all directions, moving diverse  
   and formed to flow in rivers,  
  Hasty, red, copper-hued, and purple, running all ways in  
  Purusha, upward and downward?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000212">12</span></span>Who gave
him visible form and shape? Who gave him magni-  
   tude and name?  
  Who gave him motion, consciousness? Who furnished Pūrusha  
   with feet?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000213">13</span></span>Who wove
the vital air in him, who filled him with the down-  
   ward breath?  
  What God bestowed on Pūrusha the general pervading air?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000214">14</span></span>What God,
what only Deity placed sacrifice in Pūrusha?  
  Who gave him truth and falsehood? Whence came Death and  
   immortality?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000215">15</span></span>Who wrapped
a garment round him? Who arranged the life he  
   hath to live?  
  Who granted him the boon of speech? Who gave this fleetness  
   to his feet?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000216">16</span></span>Through
whom did he spread waters out, through whom did he  
   make Day to shine?  
  Through whom did he enkindle Dawn and give the gift of even-  
   tide?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000217">17</span></span>Who set the
seed in him and said, Still be the thread of life spun  
   out?  
  Who gave him intellect besides? Who gave him voice and  
   gestic power?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000218">18</span></span>Through
whom did he bedeck the earth, through whom did he  
   encompass heaven?  
  Whose might made Pūrusha surpass the mountains and created  
   things?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000219">19</span></span>Through
whom seeks he Parjanya out, and Soma of the piercing  
   sight?  
  Through whom belief and sacrifice? Through whom was spirit  
   laid in him?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000220">20</span></span>What leads
him to the learned priest? What leads him to this  
  Lord Supreme?  
  How doth he gain this Agni? By whom hath he measured out  
   the year? <span id="page_7">p. 7</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000221">21</span></span>He, Brahma
gains the learned priest, he Brahma, gains this Lord  
  Supreme.  
  As Brahma, Man wins Agni here Brahma hath measured out the  
   year.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000222">22</span></span>Through
whom doth he abide with Gods? Through whom with  
   the Celestial Tribes?  
  Why is this other called a star? Why is this called the Real  
  Power?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000223">23</span></span>Brahma
inhabits with the Gods, Brahma among the Heavenly  
  Tribes.  
  Brahma this other star is called. Brahma is called the Real  
  Power.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000224">24</span></span>By whom was
this our earth disposed? By whom was heaven  
   placed over it?  
  By whom was this expanse of air raised up on high and stre-  
   tched across?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000225">25</span></span>By Brahma
was this earth disposed: Brahma is sky arranged  
   above.  
  Brahma is this expanse of air lifted on high and stretched  
   across.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000226">26</span></span>Together,
with his needle hath Atharvan sewn his head and  
   heart.  
  And Pavamāna hovered from his head on high above his brain.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000227">27</span></span>That is
indeed Atharvan's head, the well-closed casket of the  
  Gods.  
  Spirit and Food and Vital Air protect that head from injury.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000228">28</span></span>Stationed
on high, Purusha hath pervaded all regions spread  
   aloft and stretched transversely.  
  He who knows Brahma's cattle, yea, the fort whence Purusha is  
   named,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000229">29</span></span>Yea, knows
that fort of Brahma girt about with immortality,  
  Brahma and Brāhmas have bestowed sight, progeny, and life on  
   him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000230">30</span></span>Sight
leaves him not, breath quits not him before life's natural  
   decay,  
  Who knows the fort of Brahma, yea, the fort whence Purusha  
   is named.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000231">31</span></span>The fort of
Gods, impregnable, with circles eight and portals  
   nine, <span id="page_8">p. 8</span>  
  Contains a golden treasure-chest, celestial, begirt with light.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000232">32</span></span>Men deep in
lore of Brahma know that Animated Being which  
  Dwells in the golden treasure-chest that hath three spokes and  
   three supports.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000233">33</span></span>Brahma hath
passed within the fort, the golden castle; ne'er  
   subdued,  
  Bright with excessive brilliancy, compassed with glory round  
   about.
