### HYMN XI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501101">1</span></span>Let him to
whose house the Vrātya who possesses this knowledge  
   comes as a guest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501102">2</span></span>Rise up of
his own accord to meet him, and say, Vrātya, where  
   didst thou pass the night? Vratya, here is water, Let them  
   refresh thee. Vrātya, let it be as thou pleasest. Vrātya, as thy  
   wish is so let it be. Vrātya, as thy desire is so be it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501103">3</span></span>When he says
to his guest, Where didst thou pass the night? he  
   reserves for himself thereby the paths that lead to the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501104">4</span></span>When he says
to him, Here is water, he secures thereby water  
   for himself.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501105">5</span></span>When he says
to him, Let them refresh thee, he thereby wins  
   vital breath to exceeding old age.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501106">6</span></span>When he says
to him, Vrātya, let it be as thou pleasest, he  
   secures to himself thereby what is pleasant. <span id="page_157">p.
157</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501107">7</span></span>That which
is pleasant comes to him, and he is the beloved of  
   the beloved, who is possessed of this knowledge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501108">8</span></span>When he says
to him, Vrātya, as thy will is so let it be, he  
   secures to himself thereby the fulfilment of his will.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501109">9</span></span>Authority
comes to him who possesses this knowledge, and he  
   becomes the controller of the powerful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501110">10</span></span>When he
says to him, Vrātya, as thy desire is so be it, he secures  
   to himself thereby the attainment of his desire.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501111">11</span></span>His desire
comes to him who possesses this knowledge and he  
   gains the complete satisfaction of his wish.
