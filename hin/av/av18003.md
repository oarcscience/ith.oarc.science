### HYMN III

#### A funeral hymn, taken partly from the Rigveda

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800301">1</span></span>Choosing her
husband's world, O man, this woman lays herself  
   down beside thy lifeless body. <span id="page_192">p. 192</span>  
  Preserving faithfully the ancient custom. Bestow upon here both  
   wealth and offspring.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800302">2</span></span>Rise, come
unto the world of life, O woman: come, he is lifeless  
   by whose side thou liest.  
  Wifehood with this thy husband was thy portion who took thy  
   hand and wooed thee as a lover.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800303">3</span></span>I looked and
saw the youthful dame escorted, the living to the  
   dead: I saw them, bear her.  
  When she with blinding darkness was enveloped, then did I turn  
   her back and lead her homeward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800304">4</span></span>Knowing the
world of living beings, Aghnyā! treading the path.  
   of Gods which lies before thee,  
  This is thy husband: joyfully receive him and let him mount  
   into the world of Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800305">5</span></span>The speed of
rivers craving heaven and cane, thou, Agni, art the  
   waters' gall.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800306">6</span></span>Cool, Agni,
and again refresh the spot which thou hast scorched  
   and burnt.  
  Here let the water-lily grow, and tender grass and leafy plant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800307">7</span></span>Here is one
light for thee, another yonder: enter the third and  
   be therewith united.  
  Uniting with a body be thou lovely, dear to the Gods in their  
   sublimest mansion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800308">8</span></span>Rise up,
advance, run forward: make thy dwelling in water  
   that shall be thy place to rest in  
  There dwelling in accordance with the Fathers delight thyself  
   with Soma and libations.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800309">9</span></span>Prepare thy
body: speed thou on thy journey: let not thy limbs,.  
   thy frame be left behind thee.  
  Follow to its repose thy resting spirit: go to whatever spot of  
   earth thou lovest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800310">10</span></span>With
splendour may the Fathers, meet for Soma, with mead and.  
   fatness may the Gods anoint me.  
  Lead me on farther to extended vision, and prosper me through  
   life of long duration.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800311">11</span></span>May Agni
balm me thoroughly with splendour; may Vishnu.  
   touch my lips with understanding.  
  May all the Deities vouchsafe me riches, and pleasant Waters  
   purify and cleanse me. <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800312">12</span></span>Mitra and
Varuna have stood about me. Ādityas, Sacirifical  
  Posts exalt me!  
  May Indra balm my hands with strength and splendour. A long,  
   long life may Savitar vouchsafe me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800313">13</span></span>Worship
with sacrificial gift King Yama, Vivasvān's son who  
   gathers men together,  
  Yama who was the first to die of mortals, the first who travelled  
   to the world before us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800314">14</span></span>Depart, O
Fathers, and again come hither; this sacrifice of yours  
   is balmed with sweetness.  
  Enrich us here with gift of great possessions; grant blessed  
   wealth with ample store of heroes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800315">15</span></span>Kanva,
Kakshivān, Purumidha, Agastya, Syāvāsva Sobhari, and  
  Archanānas,  
  This Visvāmitra, Jamadagni, Atri, Kasyapa, Vāmadeva be our  
   helpers!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800316">16</span></span>Vasishtha,
Jamadagni, Visvāmitra, Gotama, Vāmadeva, Bhara-  
   dvaja!  
  Atri hath won your favour with homage. Gracious to us be ye  
   praiseworthy Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800317">17</span></span>They,
making for themselves a new existence, wash off defilement  
   in the brazen vessel.  
  May we be fragrant in our houses, ever increasing in our  
   children and our riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800318">18</span></span>They balm
him, balm him over, balm him thoroughly, caress  
   the mighty power and balm it with the mead,  
  They seize the flying steer at the stream's breathing-place:  
   cleansing with gold they grasp the animal herein.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800319">19</span></span>Fathers, be
glorious in yourselves, and follow all that is glad in  
   you and meet for Soma.  
  Give ear and listen, swiftly-moving Sages, benevolent, invoked in  
   our assembly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800320">20</span></span>Atris,
Angirases, Navagvas, givers of liberal gifts, continual  
   sacrificers,  
  Devout and pious, granting guerdon freely, sit on this holy grass  
   and be ye joyful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800321">21</span></span>As in the
days of old our ancient Fathers, speeding the work of  
   sacred worship, Agni!  
  Sought pure light and devotion, singing praises, they cleft the  
   ground and made red Dawns apparent. <span id="page_194">p.
194</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800322">22</span></span>Gods, doing
holy acts, devout, resplendent, smelting like ore  
   their human generation,  
  Brightening Agni and exalting Indra, they came encompassing  
   the stall of cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800323">23</span></span>Strong One!
he marked them, and the gods before them, like  
   herds of cattle in a foodful pasture.  
  There man moaned forth their strong desires, to strengthen even  
   the true; the nearest One, the living.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800324">24</span></span>We have
worked for thee, we have toiled and laboured: bright  
  Dawns have shed their light upon our worship.  
  All that the Gods regard with love is blessed. Loud may we  
   speak, with heroes, in assembly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800325">25</span></span>From
eastward Indra, Lord or Maruts, guard me, as in her  
   arms Earth guards the heaven above us!  
  Those who give room, who made the paths, we worship, you,  
   mid the Gods, who share the gifts we offer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800326">26</span></span>Dhātar with
Nirriti save me from southward, etc. (as in stanza  
  25).  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800327">27</span></span>From
westward Aditi was Ādityas save me! etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800328">28</span></span>From
westward with the All-Gods save me Soma! etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800329">29</span></span>May the
strong firm Sustainer bear thee upright, as Savitar bears  
   light above the heaven.  
  Those who give room, who made the paths, we worship, you  
   mid the Gods, whe share the gifts we offer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800330">30</span></span>Toward the
eastward region I supply thee before thou goest  
   homeward, with oblation, as in her arms, etc. (as in stanza 25).  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800331">31</span></span>Toward the
southern region, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800332">32</span></span>Toward the
western region, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800333">33</span></span>Toward the
northern region, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800334">34</span></span>Toward the
stedfast region, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800335">35</span></span>Toward the
upmost region I supply thee, before thou goest  
   homeward, with oblation, as in her arms Earth bears the  
   heaven above us.  
  Those who give room, who made the paths, we worship, you,  
   mid the Gods, who share the gifts we offer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800336">36</span></span>Thou art
the Bull, Supporter, and Upholder,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800337">37</span></span>Who
purifiest wind and mead and water.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800338">38</span></span>From this
side and from that let both assist me. As, speeding,  
   ye have come like two twin sisters, <span id="page_195">p.
195</span>  
  Religious-hearted votaries brought you forward. Knowing your  
   several places be ye seated.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800339">39</span></span>Sit near,
sit very near beside our Soma: for you I fit the ancient  
   prayer with homage.  
  The praise-song, like a chieftain on his pathway, spreads far and  
   wide. Let all Immortals hear it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800340">40</span></span>Three paces
hath the stake gone up, and followed her, the four-  
   footed, with devout observance.  
  He with the Syllable copies the praise-song; he thoroughly  
   purifies at Order's centre.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800341">41</span></span>Chose he
then, death for Gods to be their portion? Why chose  
   he not for men a life eternal?  
  Brihaspati span sacrifice, the Rishi; and Yama yielded up his  
   own dear body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800342">42</span></span>Thou, Agni
Jātavedas, when entreated, didst bear our offerings,  
   having made them fragrant.  
  And give them to the Fathers who consumed them with Svadhā.  
  Eat, thou God, the gifts we bring thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800343">43</span></span>Lapped in
the bosom of the purple Mornings, give riches to the  
   man who brings oblations.  
  Grant to your sons a portion of that treasure, and, present, give  
   them energy, O Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800344">44</span></span>Fathers
whom Agni's flames have tasted, come ye nigh: in per-  
   fect order take ye each your proper place.  
  Eat sacrificial food presented on the grass: grant riches with a  
   multitude of hero sons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800345">45</span></span>May they,
the Fathers who deserve the Soma, invited to their  
   favourite oblations.  
  Laid on the sacred grass, come nigh and listen. May they be  
   gracious unto us and bless us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800346">46</span></span>Our
Father's Fathers and their sires before them who came,  
   most noble, to the Soma banquet,  
  With these let Yama, yearning with the yearning, rejoicing eat  
   our offerings at his pleasure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800347">47</span></span>Come to us,
Agni, with the gracious Fathers who dwell in glow-  
   ing light, the very Sages,  
  Who thirsted mid the Gods, who hasten hither, oblation-winners,  
   theme of singers' praises.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800348">48</span></span>Come, Agni,
come with countless ancient Fathers, dwellers in  
   light, primeval, God-adorers, <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>  
  Eaters and drinkers of oblation, truthful, who travel with the  
  Deities and Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800349">49</span></span>Betake thee
to the lap of Earth, our mother, of Earth far-spread-  
   ing, very kind and gracious.  
  May she, wool-soft unto the guerdon-giver, guard thee in front  
   upon the distant pathway.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800350">50</span></span>Heave
thyself, Earth, nor press him downward heavily: afford  
   him easy access pleasant to approach,  
  Cover him as a mother wraps her skirt about her child, O  
  Earth!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800351">51</span></span>Now let the
heaving earth be free from motion: yea, let a  
   thousand clods remain above him.  
  Be they to him a home distilling fatness: here let them ever be  
   his place of refuge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800352">52</span></span>I stay the
earth from thee, while over thee I place this piece of  
   earth. May I be free from injury.  
  The Fathers firmly fix this pillar here for thee; and there let  
  Yama make thee an abiding-place.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800353">53</span></span>Forbear, O
Agni, to upset this chalice: the Gods and they who  
   merit Soma love it.  
  This cup, yea this which serves the Gods to drink from,—in this  
   let the Immortals take their pleasure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800354">54</span></span>The chalice
brimming o'er which erst Atharvan offered to Indra,  
  Lord of wealth and treasure,  
  Indu therein sets draught of virtuous action, and ever purifies  
   himself within it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800355">55</span></span>What wound
soe'er the dark bird hath inflicted, the emmet, or  
   the serpent, or the jackal,  
  May Agni who devoureth all things heal it, and Soma, who hath  
   passed into the Brāhmans.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800356">56</span></span>The plants
of earth are rich in milk, and rich in milk is this my  
   milk.  
  With all the milky essence of the Waters let them make me  
   clean.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800357">57</span></span>Let these
unwidowed dames with goodly husbands adorn them-  
   selves with fragrant balm and unguent.  
  Decked with fair jewels, tearless, free, from trouble, first let the  
   dames go up to where he lieth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800358">58</span></span>Meet Yama,
meet the Fathers, meet the merit of virtuous action  
   in the loftiest heaven. <span id="page_197">p. 197</span>  
  Leave sin and evil, seek anew thy dwelling: so bright with glory  
   let him join his body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800359">59</span></span>Our
Father's Fathers and their sires before them, they who have  
   entered into air's wide region,  
  For them shall self-resplendent Asuniti form bodies now accord-  
   ing to her pleasure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800360">60</span></span>Let the
hoar-frost be sweet to thee. sweetly on thee the rain  
   descend!  
  O full of coolness, thou cool Plant, full of fresh moisture, fresh-  
   ening Herb,  
  Bless us in waters, female Frog: calm and allay this Agni here.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800361">61</span></span>Vivasvān
make us free from fear and peril, good rescuer, quick-  
   pouring, bounteous giver!  
  Many in number be these present heroes! Increase of wealth be  
   mine in kine and horses!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800362">62</span></span>In
immortality Vivasvān set us! Go from us Death, come to us  
   life eternal!  
  To good old age may he protect these people: let not their  
   spirits pass away to Yama.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800363">63</span></span>The Sage of
Fathers, guardian of devotions who holds thee up  
   with might in air's mid-region,—  
  Praise him ye Visvāmitras, with oblation. To lengthened life  
   shall be, this Yama, lead us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800364">64</span></span>Mount and
ascend to highest heaven, O Rishis: be ye not afraid.  
  Soma-drinkers to you is paid this Soma-lover's sacrifice. We  
   have attained the loftiest light.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800365">65</span></span>Agni is
shining forth with lofty banner: the Bull is bellowing to  
   earth and heaven.  
  From the sky's limit even hath he stretched near us: the Steer  
   hath waxen in the waters' bosom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800366">66</span></span>They gaze
on thee with longing in their spirit, as on an eagle  
   that is mounting skyward;  
  On thee with wings of gold, Varuna's envoy, the Bird that  
   hasteth to the home of Yama.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800367">67</span></span>O Indra,
bring us wisdom as a sire gives wisdom to his sons.  
  Guide us, O much-invoked in this our way: may we still living  
   look upon the Sun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800368">68</span></span>Let these
which Gods have held for thee, the beakers covered  
   o'er with cake,  
  Be full of sacred food for thee, distilling fatness, rich in mead.
<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800369">69</span></span>Grains
which for thee I scatter, mixt with Sesamum, as holy  
   food,  
  May they for thee be excellent and potent: King Yama look on  
   them as thine with favour!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800370">70</span></span>O Tree,
give back again this man who is deposited on thee.  
  That he may dwell in Yama's home addressing the assemblies  
   there.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800371">71</span></span>Seize hold
O Jātavedas; let thy flame be full of fervent heat.  
  Consume his body: to the world of pious ones transport this  
   man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800372">72</span></span>To these,
thy Fathers who have passed away at first and after-  
   ward,  
  Let the full brook of butter run, o'erflowing with a hundred  
   streams.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800373">73</span></span>Mount to
this life, removing all defilement: here thine own  
   kindred shine with lofty splendour.  
  Depart thou; be not left behind: go forward, first of those here,  
   unto the world of Fathers.
