### HYMN XCVII

#### Sacrificial formulas

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0709701">1</span></span>As we have
here elected thee, skilled Hotar! to-day as this our  
   sacrifice proceedeth,  
  Come to the firm place, mightiest! yea, come firmly. Knowing  
   the sacrifice, approach the Soma.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0709702">2</span></span>With kine
connect us, and with spirit, Indra! Lord of Bay  
  Steeds, with princes and with favour,  
  With the God-destined portion of the Brāhmans,  
   and the good-will of Gods who merit worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0709703">3</span></span>The willing
Gods whom, God, thou hast brought hither, send  
   thou to their own dwelling-place, O Agni.  
  When ye have eaten and have drunk sweet juices, endow this  
   man with precious wealth, ye Vasus.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0709704">4</span></span>Gods, we
have made your seats of easy access, who, pleased  
   with me, have come to my libation.  
  Bearing and bringing hitherward your treasures, after the rich  
   warm beverage mount to heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0709705">5</span></span>Go to the
sacrifiee, go to its master, Sacrifice! To thy birth-  
   place go with Svāhā. <span id="page_a314">p. a314</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0709706">6</span></span>This is thy
sacrifice with hole hymnal, Lord of the Rite, Svāhā!  
   and fraught with vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0709707">7</span></span>Vashat to
paid and yet unpaid oblations! Ye Gods who know  
   the way, find and pursue it!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0709708">8</span></span>Lord of the
Mind, lay this our sacrifice in heaven among the  
  Gods. Svāhā in heaven! Svāhā on earth!  
  Svāhā in air! In wind have I paid offerings. Hail!
