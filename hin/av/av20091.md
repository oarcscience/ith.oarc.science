### HYMN XCI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009101">1</span></span>This holy
hymn sublime and seven-headed, sprung from eternal  
  Law, our sire discovered.  
  Ayāsya, friend of all men, hath engendered the fourth hymn as  
   he sang his laud to Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009102">2</span></span>Thinking
aright, praising eternal Order, the sons of Dyaus the  
  Asura, those heroes,  
  Angirases, holding the rank of sages, first honoured sacrifice's  
   holy statute.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009103">3</span></span>Girt by his
friends who cried with swanlike voices, bursting the  
   stoney barriers of the prison,  
  Brihaspati spake in thunder to the cattle, and uttered praise and.  
   song when he had found them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009104">4</span></span>Apart from
one, away from two above him, he draye the kine  
   that stood in bonds of falsehood.  
  Brihaspati, seeking light amid the darkness, draye forth the  
   bright cows: three he made apparent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009105">5</span></span>When he had
cleft the lairs and western castle, he cut off three  
   from him who held the waters.  
  Brihaspati discovered, while he thundered like Dyaus, the dawn,.  
   the sun, the cow, the lightning.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009106">6</span></span>As with a
hand, so with his roaring Indra cleft Vala through,.  
   the guardian of the cattle.  
  Seeking the milk-draught with sweat-shining comrades he stole:  
   the Pani's kine and left him weeping.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009107">7</span></span>He with
bright faithful friends, winners of booty, hath rent the  
   milker of the cows asunder.  
  Brihaspati with wild boars strong and mighty sweating with heat  
   hath gained a rich possession.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009108">8</span></span>They,
longing for the kine, with faithful spirit incited with their  
   hymns the Lord of cattle.  
  Brihaspati freed the radiant cows with comrades self-yoked,.  
   averting shame from one another.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009109">9</span></span>In our
assembly with auspicious praises exalting him who roareth.  
   like a lion.  
  May we in every fight where heroes conquer rejoice in strong.  
  Brihaspati the victor.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009110">10</span></span>When he had
won him strength of every nature and gone to  
   heaven and its most lofty mansions, <span id="page_337">p.
337</span>  
  Men praised Brihaspati the mighty, bringing the light within  
   their mouths from sundry places.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009111">11</span></span>Fulfil the
prayer that begs for vital vigor: aid in your wonted  
   manner e'en the humble.  
  Let all our foes be turned and driven backward. Hear this, O  
  Heaven and Earth, ye all-producers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009112">12</span></span>Indra with
mighty strength hath cleft asunder the head of Arbuda  
   the watery monster,  
  Slain Ahi, and set free the Seven Rivers. O Heaven and Earth,  
   with all the Gods, protect us.
