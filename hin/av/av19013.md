### HYMN XIII

#### A prayer for aid and victory in battle

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901301">1</span></span>These the
two sturdy, manly arms of Indra, these that are won-  
   drous, mighty, and successful  
  First, when the need hath come will I employ them by which  
   the heaven of Asuras was conquered.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901302">2</span></span>Swift, like
a dread bull sharpening his weapons, rapidly striking,  
   stirring up the people,  
  Loud shouting, vigilant, the one sole Hero, Indra subdued a  
   hundred hosts together.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901303">3</span></span>With him
loud-roaring, ever watchful, victor bold, hard to over-  
   throw, whom none may vanquish,  
  Indra the strong whose hand bears arrows, conquer, ye heroes  
   now, now vanquish in the combat.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901304">4</span></span>He rules
with those who carry shafts and quivers, Indra who  
   with his hand brings hosts together,  
  Foe-conquering, strong of arm, the Soma-drinker,  
   with mighty bow, shooting with well-laid arrows.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901305">5</span></span>Conspicuous
by thy strength, firm, foremost fighter, mighty and  
   fierce, victorious, all-subduing,  
  O'ercoming might, excelling men and heroes, mount the kine-  
   winning conquering car, O Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1901306">6</span></span>Troop-vanquisher, kine-winner, armed with
thunder, who quells  
   an army and with might destroys it,  
  Follow him, comrades! quit yourselves like heroes, and like this  
  Indra show your zeal and courage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901307">7</span></span>Piercing the
cow-stalls with surpassing vigour, Indra the pitiless  
   hero, wild with anger, <span id="page_224">p. 224</span>  
  Victor in fight, unshaken and resistless,—may he protect our  
   armies in our battles.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901308">8</span></span>Brihaspati,
fly with thy chariot hither, slayer of demons, driving.  
   off our foemen.  
  Be thou protector of our bodies, crushing our enemies, destroy-  
   ing those who hate us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901309">9</span></span>Indra guide
these! Brihaspati, the Guerdon, and Soma, and the  
  Sacrifice precede them!  
  And let the banded Maruts march in forefront of heavenly hosts  
   that conquer and demolish.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901310">10</span></span>Ours be the
potent host of mighty Indra, King Varuna, and  
  Maruts and Ādityas.  
  Uplifted is the shout of Gods who conquer, high-minded God  
   who cause the world to tremble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901311">11</span></span>May Indra
aid us when our flags are gathered: victorious be th  
   arrows of our army.  
  May our brave men of war prevail in battle. Ye Gods, protect u  
   in the shouts of onset.
