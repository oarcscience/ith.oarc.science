### HYMN V

#### On the duty of giving cows to Brāhmans, and the sin and danger of withholding the gift

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200501">1</span></span>Created by
toil and holy fervour, found by devotion, resting in  
   right;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200502">2</span></span>Invested
with truth, surrounded with honour, compassed about  
   with glory;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200503">3</span></span>Girt round
with inherent power, fortified with faith, protected,  
   by consecration, installed at sacrifice, the world her resting-  
   place;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200504">4</span></span>Brahma her
guide, the Brāhman her lord and ruler;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200505">5</span></span>Of the
Kshatriya who taketh to himself this Brāhman's cow and  
   oppresseth the Brāhman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200506">6</span></span>The glory,
the heroism, and the favouring fortune depart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200507">7</span></span>The energy
and vigour, the power and might the speech and  
   mental strength, the glory and duty;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200508">8</span></span>Devotion and
princely sway, kingship and people, brilliance and  
   honour, and splendour and wealth;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200509">9</span></span>Long life
and goodly form, and name and fame, inbreathing and  
   expiration, and sight, and hearing;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200510">10</span></span>Milk and
flavour, and food and nourishment, and right and  
   truth, and action and fulfilment, and children and cattle;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200511">11</span></span>All these
blessings of a Kshatriya depart from him when he  
   oppresseth the Brāhman and taketh to himself the hhman's  
   cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200512">12</span></span>Terrible is
she this Brāhman's cow, and fearfully venomous,  
   visibly witchcraft.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200513">13</span></span>In her are
all horrors and all death.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200514">14</span></span>In her are
all dreadful, deeds, all slaughters of mankind.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200515">15</span></span>This, the
Brāhman's cow, being appropriated, holdeth bound in  
   the fetter of Death the oppressor of the Brāhman, the blas-  
   phemer of the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200516">16</span></span>A
hundred-killing bolt is she: she slays the Brāhman's injurer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200517">17</span></span>Therefore
the Brāhmans' cow is held inviolable by the wise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200518">18</span></span>Running she
is a thunderbolt, when driven away she is Vaisvā-  
   nara;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200519">19</span></span>An arrow
when she draweth up her hooves, and Mahādeva when  
   she looketh around;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200520">20</span></span>Sharp as a
razor when she beholdeth, she thundereth when she  
   belloweth. <span id="page_104">p. 104</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200521">21</span></span>Death is
she when she loweth, and a fierce God when she whis-  
   keth her tail;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200522">22</span></span>Utter
destruction when she moveth her ears this way and that,  
  Consumption when she droppeth water;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200523">23</span></span>A missile
when milking, pain in the head when milked;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200524">24</span></span>The taking
away of strength when she approacheth, a hand-to-  
   hand fighter when roughly touched;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200525">25</span></span>Wounding
like an arrow when she is fastened by her mouth,  
   contention when she is beaten;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200526">26</span></span>Fearfully
venomous when falling, darkness when she hath fallen  
   down.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200527">27</span></span>Following
him, the Brāhman's cow extinguisheth the vital breath  
   of the injurer of the Brāhman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200528">28</span></span>Hostility
when being cut to pieces, woe to children when the  
   portions are distributed,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200529">29</span></span>A
destructive missile of Gods when she is being seized,  
   misfortune when carried away;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200530">30</span></span>Misery
while being additionally acquired, contumely and abuse  
   while being put in the stall;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200531">31</span></span>Poison when
in agitation, fever when seasoned with condi-  
   ments;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200532">32</span></span>Sin while
she is cooking, evil dream when she is cooked;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200533">33</span></span>Uprooting
when she is being turned round, destruction when she  
   hath been turned round;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200534">34</span></span>Discord by
her smell, grief when she is being eviscerated: ser-  
   pent with poison in its fang when drawn;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200535">35</span></span>Loss of
power while sacrificially presented, humiliation when she  
   hath been offered;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200536">36</span></span>Wrathful
Sarva while being carved. Simidā when cut up:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200537">37</span></span>Poverty
while she is being eaten. Destruction when eaten.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200538">38</span></span>The
Brāhman's cow when eaten cuts off the injurer of Brāhmans  
   both from this world and from the world yonder.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200539">39</span></span>Her
slaughter is the sin of witchcraft, her cutting-up is a thunder-  
   bolt, her undigested grass is a secret spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1200540">40</span></span>Homelessness is she when denied her
rights.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200541">41</span></span>Having
become Flesh-eating Agni the Brāhman's cow entereth  
   into and devoureth the oppressor of Brāhmans.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200542">42</span></span>She sunders
all his members, joints, and roots.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200543">43</span></span>She cuts
off relationship on the father's side and destroys mater-  
   nal kinship. <span id="page_105">p. 105</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200544">44</span></span>The
Brāhman's cow, not restored by a Kshatriya, ruins the  
   marriages and all the kinsmen of the Brāhman's oppressor.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200545">45</span></span>She makes
him houseless, homeless, childless: he is extinguished  
   without posterity to succeed him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200500">0</span></span>46. So shall
it be with the Kshatriya who takes to himself the cow  
   of the Braman who hath this knowledge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200547">47</span></span>Quickly,
when he is smitten down by death, the clamorous vul-  
   tures cry:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200548">48</span></span>Quickly
around his funeral fire dance women with dishevelled  
   locks,  
  Striking the hand upon the breast and uttering their evil shriek.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200549">49</span></span>Quickly the
wolves are howling in the habitation where he  
   lived:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200550">50</span></span>Quickly
they ask about him, What is this? What thing hath  
   happened here?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200551">51</span></span>Rend, rend
to pieces, rend away, destroy, destroy him utterly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200552">52</span></span>Destroy
Angirasi! the wretch who robs and wrongs the Brah-  
   mans, born.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200553">53</span></span>Of evil
womb, thou witchcraft hid, for Vaisvadevi is thy name,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200554">54</span></span>Consuming,
burning all things up, the thunderbolt of spell and  
   charm.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200555">55</span></span>Go thou,
becoming Mrityu sharp as razor's edge pursue thy  
   course:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200556">56</span></span>Thou
bearest off the tyrants' strength, their store of merit, and  
   their prayers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200557">57</span></span>Bearing off
wrong, thou givest in that world to him who hath  
   been wronged.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200558">58</span></span>O Cow,
become a tracker through the curse the Brāhman hath  
   pronounced,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200559">59</span></span>Become a
bolt, an arrow through his sin, be terribly venomous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200560">60</span></span>O Cow,
break thou the head of him who wrongs the Brāhmans,  
   criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200561">61</span></span>Let Agni
burn the spiteful wretch when crushed to death and  
   slain by thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200562">62</span></span>Rend, rend
to bits, rend through and through, scorch and con-  
   sume and burn to dust,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200563">63</span></span>Consume
thou, even from the root, the Brāhmans' tyrant, god-  
   like Cow!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200564">64</span></span>That he may
go from Yama's home afar into the worlds of sin.  
   its <span id="page_106">p. 106</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200565">65</span></span>So, Goddess
Cow, do thou from him, the Brāhmans' tyrant,  
   criminal, niggard, blasphemer of the Gods,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200566">66</span></span>With
hundred-knotted thunderbolt, sharpened and edged with  
   razor-blades,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200567">67</span></span>Strike off
the shoulders and the head.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200568">68</span></span>Snatch thou
the hair from off his head, and from his body strip  
   the skin:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200569">69</span></span>Tear out
his sinews, cause his flesh to fall in pieces from his  
   frame.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200570">70</span></span>Crush thou
his bones together, strike and beat the marrow out  
   of him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200571">71</span></span>Dislocate
all his limbs and joints.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200572">72</span></span>From earth
let the Carnivorous Agni drive him, let Vayu burn.  
   him from mid-air's broad region.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200573">73</span></span>From heaven
let Sūrya drive him and consume him.
