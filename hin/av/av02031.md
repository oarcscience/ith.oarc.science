### HYMN XXXI

#### A charm against all sorts of worms

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203101">1</span></span>With Indra's
mighty millstone, that which crushes worms of  
   every sort,  
  I bray and bruise the worms to bits like vetches on the grinding  
   stone.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203102">2</span></span>The Seen and
the Invisible, and the Kurūru have I crushed:  
  Alāndus, and all Chhalunas, we bruise to pieces with our spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203103">3</span></span>I kill
Alāndus with a mighty weapon: burnt or not burnt they  
   now have lost their vigour .  
  Left or not left, I with the spell subdue them: let not a single  
   worm remain uninjured.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203104">4</span></span>The worm
that lives within the ribs, within the bowels, in the  
   head.  
  Avaskava and Borer, these we bruise to pieces with the spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203105">5</span></span>Worms that
are found on mountains, in the forests, that live in  
   plants, in cattle, in the waters,  
  Those that have made their way within our bodies,—these I  
   destroy, the worms' whole generation.
