### HYMN IX

#### A charm addressed to a precious ointment for safety and wealth

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400901">1</span></span>Approach!
thou art the mountain's eye, the living thing that  
   saveth us;  
  A gift bestowed by all the Gods, yea, the defence that guardeth  
   life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400902">2</span></span>Thou art the
safeguard of the men, thou art the safeguard of  
   the kine,  
  Thou standest ready to protect the horses that are fleet of foot.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400903">3</span></span>Thou, also,
Salve! art a defence that rends and crushes  
   sorcerers.  
  Thou knowest, too, of Amrit, thou art the delight of all who  
   live, a jaundice-curing balm art thou.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400904">4</span></span>Whomso thou
creepest over, Salve! member by member, joint  
   by joint,  
  From him, like some strong arbiter of strife, thou banishest  
   decline.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400905">5</span></span>No
imprecation reaches him, no magic, no tormenting fiend,  
  O Salve, Vishkandha seizes not the man who carries thee about.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400906">6</span></span>From lying
speech, from evil dream, from wicked act and  
   sinfulness, <span id="page_a114">p. a114</span>  
  From hostile and malignant eye,—from these, O Salve, protect  
   us well.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400907">7</span></span>I, knowing
this, O Salve, will speak the very truth and not a  
   lie:  
  May I obtain both horse and ox, may I obtain thy life, O man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400908">8</span></span>Three are
the slaves that serve the Salve, Fever, Consumption,  
   and the Snake.  
  Thy father is the loftiest of mountains, named the Triple-  
   peaked.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400909">9</span></span>Sprung from
the Snowy Mountain's side, this Ointment of the  
  Three-peaked hill.  
  Crushes and rends all sorcerers and every witch and sorceress.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400910">10</span></span>If thou art
from the Three-peaked hill or hast thy name from  
  Yamunā,  
  These names are both auspicious: by these two protect thou us,  
  O Salve!
