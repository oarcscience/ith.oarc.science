### HYMN LVI

#### A hymn to Sleep

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905601">1</span></span>Thou art
come hither from the world of Yama: thou, resolute,  
   affectest men with rapture.  
  Thou, Sleep, created in the Asura's dwelling, goest, well-know-  
   ing, with the solitary.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905602">2</span></span>At first the
all-containing, depth beheld thee, ere Night was  
   born, when only Day existed.  
  Thence hast thou come, thence, Sleep, hast thou come hither,  
   concealing, deep within, all form and figure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905603">3</span></span>Come from
the Asuras in lofty, glory, he hath approached the  
  Gods in search of greatness.  
  Winners of heavenly light, the Three-and-Thirty endowed this  
  Sleep with his supreme dominion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905604">4</span></span>Of him nor
Fathers nor the Gods have knowledge, the Gods  
   whose gentle talk is still about him.  
  Urged by command of Varuna the Ādityas, Heroes, transported  
  Sleep to Trita Āptya.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905605">5</span></span>Thou whose
severity hath reached ill-doers, and whose reward  
   the good have gained in slumber,  
  Delightest heaven with thy most lofty kinship, born from his  
   spirit who was worn and weary.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905606">6</span></span>Of old we
know all places whence thou comest. O Sleep, we  
   know him who is here thy ruler.  
  Protect us here illustrious with glory. Go, from afar, with  
   poisons, into distance.
