### HYMN XL

#### A charm against rival worshippers

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0404001">1</span></span>O Jātavedas,
eastward sacrificers, as foes assail us from the  
   eastern quarter.  
  May they, turned back, be pained for harming Agni. I drive  
   them backward with mine incantation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0404002">2</span></span>O Jātavedas,
southward sacrificers as foes assail us from the  
   southern quarter.  
  May they, turned back, be pained for harming Yama. I smite  
   them backward with mine incantation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0404003">3</span></span>O Jātavedas,
westward sacrificers as foes assail us from the  
   western quarter.

   backward with mine incantation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0404004">4</span></span>Jātavedas,
northward sacrificers as foes assail us from the

   backward with mine incantation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0404005">5</span></span>O Jātavedas,
nether sacrificers, as foes assail us from the stead-  
   fast quarter.  
  For harming Earth let them be turned and troubled. I smite  
   them backward with mine incantation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0404006">6</span></span>Those who
pay sacrifice, O Jātavedas, from air assail us from  
   the midway quarter.  
  For harming Vāyu be they turned and troubled! I smite them  
   backward with mine incantation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0404007">7</span></span>The
sacrificers from above assail us, O Jātavedas, from the lofty  
   quarter.  
  For wronging Sūrya be they turned and troubled! I smite them  
   backward with mine incantation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0404008">8</span></span>Those from
all points assail us, Jātavedas, who sacrifice from  
   intermediate regions.  
  For wronging Prayer let them be turned and troubled, I smite  
   them backward with mine incantation.
