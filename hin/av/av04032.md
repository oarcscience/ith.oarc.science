### HYMN XXXII

#### A hymn to Manyu

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403201">1</span></span>He who hath
reverenced thee, Manyu, destructive bolt! breeds.  
   for himself forthwith all conquering energy.  
  Arya and Dāsa will we conquer with thine aid, with thee the  
   conqueror, with conquest conquest-sped.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403202">2</span></span>Manyu was
Indra, yea, the God was Manyu; Manyu was Hotar  
  Varuna, Jātavedas.  
  The tribes of human lineage worship Manyu. Accordant, with  
   thy fervour, Manyu! guard us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403203">3</span></span>Come hither,
Manyu, mightier than the mighty: smite, with thy  
   fervour, for ally, our foemen.  
  Slayer of foes, of Vritra, and of Dasyu, bring thou to us all kinds  
   of wealth and treasure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403204">4</span></span>For thou
art, Manyu, of surpassing vigour, fierce, queller of the  
   foe, and self-existent,  
  Shared by all men, victorious, subduer: vouchsafe to us superior  
   strength in battles.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403205">5</span></span>I have
departed still without a portion, wise God! according to  
   thy will, the mighty.  
  I, feeble man, was wroth with thee, O Manyu. Come in thy  
   proper form and give us vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403206">6</span></span>Come hither,
I am all thine own: advancing, turn thou to me,  
   victorious, all-bestowing. <span id="page_a142">p. a142</span>  
  Come to me, Manyu, wielder of the thunder: bethink thee of  
   thy friend, and slay the Dasyus.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403207">7</span></span>Approach,
and on our right hand hold thy station, then let us  
   slay a multitude of foemen.  
  The best of meath I offer to support thee: may we be first to  
   drink thereof in quiet.
