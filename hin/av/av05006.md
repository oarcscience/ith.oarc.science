### HYMN VI

#### A prayer for protection and prosperity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500601">1</span></span>Eastward at
first the prayer was generated: Vena disclosed bright  
   flashes from the summit, <span id="page_a161">p. a161</span>  
  Disclosed his deepest nearest revelations, womb of the non-  
   existent and existent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500602">2</span></span>None have
attained to those of old, those who wrought holy  
   acts for you,  
  Let them not harm our heroes here. Therefore I set before you  
   this.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0500603">3</span></span>Sweet-tongued, exhaustless, they have
sent their voices down  
   together in heaven's vault that pours a thousand streams.  
  His wildly-restless warders never close an eye: in every place  
   the snarers stand to bind men fast.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500604">4</span></span>Speed
forward, conquering all foes, to win the spoil,  
  Thou comest on thy haters with a surging sea. Thy name is  
  Fragile. The thirteenth month is Indra's home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500605">5</span></span>Through this
now hast thou sent thy gifts. All hail!  
  With sharpened arms and missiles, kind and friendly, be gracious  
   unto us, Soma and Rudra!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500606">6</span></span>Through this
hast thou been left in want. All hail!  
  With sharpened arms and missiles, kind and friendly, be gracious  
   unto us, Soma and Rudra!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500607">7</span></span>Through this
hast thou committed faults. All hail!  
  With sharpened arms and missiles, kind and friendly, be gracious  
   unto us, Soma and Rudra!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500608">8</span></span>Free us from
trouble, free us from dishonour, accept our wor-  
   ship, give us life immortal.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500609">9</span></span>O missile of
the eye, missile of spirit, thou missile of devotion  
   and of fervour!  
  Thou art the weapon shot against the weapon. Let those be  
   weaponless who sin against us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500610">10</span></span>Make with
thy weapon weaponless, O Agni, all wicked men  
   who deal with us as foemen with eye, with thought, with  
   spirit, or intention.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500611">11</span></span>Thou art
the house of Indra. I betake me to thee, I enter thee  
   with all my cattle,  
  With all my people and with all my body, with all my soul, with  
   mine entire possessions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500612">12</span></span>Thou art
the guard of Indra. I betake me to thee, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500613">13</span></span>Thou art
the shield of Indra. I betake me to thee, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500614">14</span></span>Indra's
protection art thou. I betake me to thee, I enter thee  
   with all my cattle.  
  With all my people and with all my body, with all my soul, with <span
id="page_a162">p. a162</span>  
   mine entire possessions.
