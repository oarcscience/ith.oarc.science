### HYMN LXXXI

#### A hymn to the New Moon

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0708101">1</span></span>Forward and
backward by their wondrous power move these  
   two youths, disporting, round the ocean.  
  One views all living things, and thou, the other, art born again  
   arranging times and seasons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0708102">2</span></span>Thou art
re-born for ever new: thou marchest, ensign of days,  
   in forefront of the mornings.  
  Marching thou dealest to the Gods their portion. Thou lengthe-  
   nest, Moon! the days of man's existence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0708103">3</span></span>O spray of
Soma, Lord of Wars! all-perfect verily art thou.  
  Make me all-perfect, Beauteous One! in riches and in progeny.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0708104">4</span></span>Thou art the
New Moon, fair to see, thou art complete in every  
   part.  
  May I be perfect, fully blest in every way in steeds and kine, in  
   children, cattle, home, and wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0708105">5</span></span>Inflate thee
with his vital breath who hathes us and whom we  
   detest.  
  May we grow rich in steeds and kine, in children, cattle, houses,  
   wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0708145">45</span></span>With that
unwasting stalk which Gods, unwasting Gods, in-  
   crease and eat, <span id="page_a307">p. a307</span>  
  May Varuna, Brihaspati, and Indra, the Lords and Guardians of  
   the world, increase us.
