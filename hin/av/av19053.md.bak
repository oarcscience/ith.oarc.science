### HYMN LIII

#### A hymn to Kāma or Time

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905301">1</span></span>Prolific,
thousand-eyed, and undecaying, a horse with seven  
   reins Time bears us onward.  
  Sages inspired with holy knowledge mount him: his chariot  
   wheels are all the worlds of creatures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905302">2</span></span>This Time
hath seven rolling wheels and seven naves immorality  
   is the chariot's axle.  
  This Time brings hitherward all worlds about us: as primal  
  Deity is he entreated.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905303">3</span></span>On Time is
laid an overflowing beaker: this we behold in many  
   a place appearing.  
  He carries from us all these worlds of creatures. They call him  
  Kāla in the loftiest heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905304">4</span></span>He only made
the worlds of life, he only gathered the worlds  
   of living things together.  
  Their son did he become who was their Father: no other higher  
   power than he existeth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905305">5</span></span>Kāla created
yonder heaven, and Kāla made these realms of  
   earth.  
  By Kāla, stirred to motion, both what is and what shall be  
   expand.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905306">6</span></span>Kāla created
land; the Sun in Kāla hath his light and heat.  
  In Kāla rest all things that be: in Kāla doth the eye discern.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905307">7</span></span>In Kāla
mind, in Kāla breath, in Kāla name are fixt and joined.  
  These living creatures, one and all, rejoice when Kāla hath  
   approached.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905308">8</span></span>Kāla
embraces Holy Fire, the Highest, Brahma in himself.  
  Yea, Kāla, who was father of Prajāpati, is Lord of All.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905309">9</span></span>He made, he
stirred this universe to motion, and on him it rests.  
  He, Kāla, having now become Brahma, holds Parameshthin up. <span
id="page_255">p. 255</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1905210">10</span></span>Kāla
created living things and, first of all, Prajāpati.  
  From Kāla self-made Kasyapa, from Kāla Holy Fire was born.
