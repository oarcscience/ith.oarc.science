### HYMN IX

#### A prayer for general protection and prosperity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900901">1</span></span>Gentle be
heaven, gentle be earth, gentle this spacious,  
   atmosphere.  
  Gentle be waters as they flow, gentle to us be plants and herbs!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900902">2</span></span>Gentle be
signs of coming change, and that which is and is not.  
   done!  
  Gentle be past and future, yea, let all be gracious unto us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900903">3</span></span>Quickened by
Prayer, this Goddess Vāk who standeth in the  
   highest place,  
  By whom the awful spell was made, even through her to us be  
   peace!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900904">4</span></span>Or, made
more keen by Prayer, this mind that standeth in the  
   highest place,  
  Whereby the awful spell was made, even through this be peace  
   to us!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900905">5</span></span>These five
sense-organs with the mind as sixth, sharpened by  
  Prayer, abiding in my heart,  
  By which the awful spell was made, even by these be peace to  
   us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900906">6</span></span>Favour us
Mitra, Varuna, and Vishnu, and Prajāpati! Gracious•  
   to us be Indra and Brihaspati and Aryaman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900907">7</span></span>Favour us
Mitra, Varuna, Vivasvān, and the Finisher,  
  Portents on earth and in the air, and planets wandering in  
   heaven!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900908">8</span></span>Gracious to
us be trembling earth, gracious the flaming meteor  
   stroke!  
  Gracious be kine who yield red milk, gracious be earth when  
   sinking down!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900909">9</span></span>Gracious be
meteor-stricken constellation, gracious to us be  
   magic spells and witchcraft!  
  Gracious to us be buried charms, and gracious the meteors and  
   the portents of the region!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900910">10</span></span>Kind be the
Powers who seize the Moon, with Rāhu be Ādityas  
   kind!  
  Favour us Death and Cornet, and Rudras with penetrating.  
   might!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900911">11</span></span>Rudras and
Vasus favour us, Ādityas, Agnis favour us!  
  Favour us mighty Rishis, Gods, Goddesses, and Brihaspati!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900912">12</span></span>Brahma,
Dhātar, Prajāpati, Worlds, Vedas, Agnis, Rishis Seven. <span
id="page_220">p. 220</span>  
  All these have blessed my happy way. May Indra be my  
   guardian, may Brahmā protect and shelter me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900913">13</span></span>May all the
Gods protect me, may the Gods united shield me  
   well.  
  May all alleviations in the world which the Seven Rishis know.  
  Be kind and gracious unto me. Bliss and security be mine!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1900914">14</span></span>Earth
alleviation, air alleviation, heaven alleviation, waters  
   alleviation, plants alleviation, trees alleviation, all Gods my al-  
   leviation, collective Gods my alleviation, alleviation by allevia-  
   tions. By these alleviations, these universal alleviations, I allay  
   all that is terrific here, all that is cruel, all that is wicked.
This  
   hath been calmed, this is now auspicious.  
  Let all be favourable to us.
