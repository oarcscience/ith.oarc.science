### HYMN XLII

#### In praise of Brahma, Prayer, or Devotion

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904201">1</span></span>Brahma is
Hotar, sacrifice: with Brahma are the stakes set up.  
  From Brahma was the Adhvaryu born, from Brahma hidden  
   offering.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904202">2</span></span>Brahma is
fatness-dropping scoops: with Brahma was the altar  
   reared. <span id="page_245">p. 245</span>  
  Brahma is worship, lengthened rite, the Rishis who pay sacrifice,  
   the victim's Immolators. Hail!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904203">3</span></span>To him who
frees from woe mine hymn I offer, to the Good  
  Guardian, as I seek his favour.  
  Accept this offering of mine, O Indra. Fulfilled be all the sacri-  
   ficer's wishes!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904204">4</span></span>With prayer
I call on him who frees from trouble, Prince of  
  Gods, Splendid, chief of sacrifices,  
  I call the Waters' Child and both the Asvins, Vigour is mine,  
   and strength bestowed by Indra.
