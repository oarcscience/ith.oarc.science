### HYMN V

#### A charm accompanying investiture with an amulet

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800501">1</span></span>Upon the
strong is bound the strong, this magic cord, this Amu-  
   let,  
  Potent, foe-slayer, served by valiant heroes, happy and fortu-  
   nate defence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800502">2</span></span>This Charm,
foe-slayer, served by many heroes, strong, power-  
   ful, victorious, and mighty, goes bravely forth to meet and  
   ruin witchcraft.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800503">3</span></span>With this
same Amulet wise Indra routed the Asuras, with this  
   he slaughtered Vritra,  
  With this he won this pair, both Earth and Heaven, and made  
   the sky's four regions his possession.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800504">4</span></span>May this
encircling magic cord, this Amulet of Srāktya wood,  
  Mighty, subduing enemies, keep us secure on every side.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800505">5</span></span>This Agni
hath declared, Soma declared it, Brihaspati, and  
  Savitar, and Indra.  
  So may these Gods whom I have set before me oppose with  
   saving charms and banish witchcraft.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800506">6</span></span>I have
obscured the heaven and earth, yea, and the daylight and  
   the sun.  
  So may these Gods whom I have set before me oppose with  
   saving charms and banish witchcraft.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800507">7</span></span>Whoever for
his armour takes an amulet of the Srāktya tree,  
  Like the Sun risen up to heaven, quells witchcraft with superior  
   might.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800508">8</span></span>With Amulet
of Srāktya wood, as with a thoughtful Rishi's aid,  
  In every fight have I prevailed; I smite the foes and Rākshasas.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800509">9</span></span>All
witchcraft of Angirases,"all witchcraft wrought by Asuras,  
  All witchcraft self-originate, and all that others have prepared,  
  May these depart to both remotest spaces, past ninety ample  
   water-floods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800510">10</span></span>May the
Gods bind the Charm on him for armour, Indra, and  
  Vishnu, Savitar Rudra, Agni,  
  Prajāpati, sublimest Parameshlhin, Virāj, Vaisvānara, and all  
   the Rishis.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800511">11</span></span>Thou art
the chief of all the plants, even as a bull among the  
   beasts. <span id="page_a335">p. a335</span>  
  A tiger of the beasts of prey. Him whom we sought for have we  
   found, him lying near in wait for us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800512">12</span></span>A tiger
verily is he, he is a lion, and a bull,  
  Subduer of his foes is he, the man who wears this Amulet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800513">13</span></span>No mortal
beings slay him, no Gāndharvas, no Apsarases;  
  O'er all the regions he is king, the man who wears this Amulet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800514">14</span></span>Kasyapa
formed and fashioned thee, Kasyapa raised and sent  
   thee forth.  
  Indra wore thee, and, wearing thee, won in the wrestling-match  
   with man.  
   The Amulet of boundless might the Gods have made a coat of  
   mail.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800515">15</span></span>Whoever
would destroy thee with Dikshā-rites, sacrifices, spells,  
  Meet him and smite him, Indra! with thy hundred-knotted  
   thunderbolt.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800516">16</span></span>Verily let
this Amulet, circular, potent, conquering,  
  Happy and fortunate defence, preserve thy children and thy  
   wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800517">17</span></span>Brave
Indra, set before us light, peace and security from below,  
  Peace and security from above, peace and security from behind.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800518">18</span></span>My coat of
mail is Heaven and Earth, my coat of mail is Day  
   and Sun:  
  A coat of mail may Indra and Agni and Dhātar grant to me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800519">19</span></span>Not all the
Gods may pierce, all leagued together, the vast  
   strong shield which Indra gives, and Agni.  
  May that great shield on all sides guard my body, that to full  
   old my life may be extended.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800520">20</span></span>Let the
Gods' Charm be bound on me to keep me safe from  
   every ill.  
  Come ye and enter all within this pillar, the safe-guard of the  
   body, thrice-defended.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800521">21</span></span>In this let
Indra lay a store of valour: approach ye Gods, and  
   enter it together,  
  For his long life, to last a hundred autumns, that to full age his  
   days may be extended.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800522">22</span></span>Lord of the
clan who brings, us bliss, fiend-slayer, queller of the  
   foe,  
  May he, the conqueror, ne'er subdued, may Indra bind the  
  Charm on thee, <span id="page_a336">p. a336</span>  
  Bull, Soma-drinker, he who gives us peace.  
  May he protect thee round about, by night and day on every,  
   side.
