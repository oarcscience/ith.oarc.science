### HYMN II

#### On the Bridal of Sūryā, marriage ceremonies in general, continued

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400201">1</span></span>For thee
with bridal train they first escorted Sūryā to her home,  
  Give to the husband in return, Agni, the wife with future sons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400202">2</span></span>Agni hath
given the bride again with splendour and a lengthened.  
   life.  
  Long-lived be he who is her lord: a hundred autumns let him  
   live.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400203">3</span></span>She was the
wife of Soma first: next the Gandharva was thy  
   lord.  
  Agni was the third husband: now one born of woman is thy  
   fourth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400204">4</span></span>Soma to the
Gandharva, and to Agni the Gandharva gave.  
  Now, Agni hath bestowed on me riches and sons and this my  
   bride.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400205">5</span></span>Your
favouring grace hath come, ye who are rich in spoil!  
  Asvins, your longings are stored up within your hearts.  
  Ye, Lords of Splendour have become our twofold guard: may  
   we as dear friends reach the dwelling of the friend.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400206">6</span></span>Thou, Dame,
rejoicing, take with kindly spirit wealth worthy to  
   be famed, with all thy heroes.  
  Give, Lords of Light a fair ford, good to drink at: remove the  
   spiteful stump that blocks the pathway.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400207">7</span></span>May all the
Rivers, all the Plants, may all the Forests, all the  
  Fields,  
  O Bride, protect thee from the fiend, guard his sons' mother for  
   her lord. <span id="page_140">p. 140</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400208">8</span></span>Our feet are
on this pleasant path, easy to travel, bringing bliss,  
  Whereon no hero suffers harm, which wins the wealth of other  
   men.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400209">9</span></span>Here these
my words, ye men, the benediction through which  
   the wedded pair have found high fortune.  
  May the divine Apsarases, Gandharvas, all they who are these  
   fruitful trees' protectors,  
  Regard this bride with their auspicious, favour, nor harm the  
   nuptial pomp as it advances.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1400210">10</span></span>Consumptions, which, through various
folk, attack the bride's  
   resplendent train,  
  These let the holy Gods again bear to the place from which they  
   sprang.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400211">11</span></span>Let not the
highway thieves who lie in ambush find the wedded  
   pair.  
  Let wicked men's malignities go elsewhere by an easy path.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400212">12</span></span>I look upon
the house and bride's procession with prayer and  
   with the gentle eye of friendship.  
  All that is covered there in perfect beauty may Savitar make  
   pleasant to the husband.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400213">13</span></span>She hath
come home this dame come home to bless us: this her  
   appointed world hath Dhātar shown her.  
  So may Prajāpati, and both the Asvins, Aryaman, Bhaga gladden  
   her with offspring.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400214">14</span></span>This dame
hath come, an animated corn-field: there sow, thou  
   man, the seed of future harvest.  
  She from her teeming side shall bear thee children, and feed  
   them from the fountain of her bosom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400215">15</span></span>Take thou
thy stand, a Queen art thou, like Vishnu here,  
  Sarasvati!  
  O Sinivali, let her bear children, and live in Bhaga's grace.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400216">16</span></span>So let your
wave bear up the pins, and ye, O Waters, spare the  
   thongs;  
  And never may the holy pair, sinless and innocent, suffer harm.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400217">17</span></span>Not
evil-eyed no slayer of thy husband, be strong, mild, kind,  
   and gentle to thy household.  
  Mother of heroes, love thy husband's father: be happy, and  
   through thee may we too prosper.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400218">18</span></span>No slayer
of thy husband or his father, gentle and bright, bring  
   blessing on the cattle. <span id="page_141">p. 141</span>  
  Loving thy husband's father, bring forth heroes. Tend well this  
   household fire: be soft and pleasant.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400219">19</span></span>Up and
begone! What wish hath brought thee hither from thine  
   own house? Thy mightier, I conjure thee.  
  Vain is the hope, O Nirriti, that brought thee. Fly off, Malignity;  
   stay here no longer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400220">20</span></span>As first of
all this woman hath adored the sacred household  
   fire.  
  So do thou, Dame, pay homage to the Fathers and Sarasvati.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400221">21</span></span>Take thou
this wrapper as a screen, to be a covering for the  
   bride  
  O Sinivali, let her bear children, and live in Bhaga's grace.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400222">22</span></span>Let her who
shall be blest with sons, the maid who finds a.  
   husband, step  
  Upon the rough grass that ye spread and on the skin ye lay  
   beneath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400223">23</span></span>Over the
ruddy-coloured skin strew thou the grass, the Balbuja.  
  Let her, the mother of good sons, sit there and serve this Agni  
   here.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400224">24</span></span>Step on the
skin and wait upon this Agni: he is the God who  
   drives away all demons.  
  Here bear thou children to this man thy husband: let this thy  
   boy be happy in his birthnight.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400225">25</span></span>Let many
babes of varied form and nature spring in succession  
   from this fruitful mother.  
  Wait on this fire, thou bringer of good fortune. Here with thy  
   husband serve the Gods with worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1400226">26</span></span>Bliss-bringer, furthering thy
household's welfare, dear gladdening  
   thy husband and his father, enter this home, mild to thy hus-  
   band's mother.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400227">27</span></span>Be pleasant
to the husband's sire, sweet to thy household and thy  
   lord,  
  To all this clan be gentle, and favour these men's prosperity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400228">28</span></span>Signs of
good fortune mark the bride. Come all of you and look  
   at her.  
  Wish her prosperity: take on you her evil lucks and go your  
   way.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400229">29</span></span>Ye youthful
maidens, ill-disposed, and all ye ancient woman  
   here, <span id="page_142">p. 142</span>  
  Give all your brilliance to the bride, then to your several homes  
   depart!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400230">30</span></span>Sūryā the
child of Savitar mounted for high felicity Her litter  
   with its cloth of gold, wearing all forms of loveliness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400231">31</span></span>Rise, mount
the bridal bed with cheerful spirit. Here bring forth  
   children to this man thy husband.  
  Watchful and understanding like Indrāni wake thou before the  
   earliest light of Morning.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400232">32</span></span>The Gods at
first lay down beside their consorts; body with  
   body met in close embracement.  
  O Dame, like Sūryā perfect in her grandeur, here rich in future  
   children, meet thy husband.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400233">33</span></span>Rise and go
hence, Visvāvasu: with reverence we worship thee.  
  Steal to her sister dwelling with her father: this is the share—  
   mark this—of old assigned thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400234">34</span></span>Apsarases
rejoice and feast together between the sun and place  
   of sacrificing.  
  These are thy kith and kin: go thou and join them: I in due  
   season worship thee Gandharva.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400235">35</span></span>Homage we
pay to the Gandharva's favour, obeisance to his eye  
   and fiery anger.  
  Visvāvasu, with prayer we pay thee homage. Go hence to those  
  Apsarases thy consorts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400236">36</span></span>May we be
happy with abundant riches. We from this place  
   have banished the Gandharva.  
  The God is gone to the remotest region, and we have come  
   where men prolong existence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400237">37</span></span>In your due
season, Parents! come together. Mother and sire be  
   ye of future children.  
  Embrace this woman like a happy lover. Raise ye up offspring  
   here: increase your riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400238">38</span></span>Send her
most rich in every charm, O Pūshan, her who shall be  
   the sharer of my pleasures;  
  Her who shall twine her eager arms about me, and welcome all  
   my love and soft embraces.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400239">39</span></span>Up, happy
bridegroom! with a joyous spirit caress thy wife and  
   throw thine arm around her.  
  Here take your pleasure, procreate your offspring. May Savitar  
   bestow long life upon you. <span id="page_143">p. 143</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400240">40</span></span>So may the
Lord of Life vouchsafe you children, Aryaman bind  
   you, day and night, together.  
  Enter thy husband's house with happy omens, bring blessing to  
   our quadrupeds and bipeds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400241">41</span></span>Sent by the
Gods associate with Manu, the vesture of the bride,  
   the nuptial garment,  
  He who bestows this on a thoughtful Brāhman, drives from the  
   marriage-bed all evil demons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400242">42</span></span>The
priestly meed wherewith ye twain present me, the vesture of  
   the bride, the nuptial garment,  
  This do ye both, Brihaspati and Indra, bestow with loving-kind-  
   ness on the Brāhman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400243">43</span></span>On your
soft couch awaking both together, revelling heartily with  
   joy and laughter,  
  Rich with brave sons, good cattle, goodly homestead, live long to  
   look on many radiant mornings.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400244">44</span></span>Clad in new
garments, fragrant, well-apparelled, to meet reful-  
   gent Dawn have I arisen.  
  I, like a bird that quits the egg, am freed from sin and purified.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400245">45</span></span>Splendid
are Heaven and Earth, still near to bless us, mighty in  
   their power;  
  The seven streams have flowed: may they, Goddesses, free us  
   from distress  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400246">46</span></span>To Sūryā
and the Deities, to Mitra and to Varuna,  
  Who know aright the thing that is, this adoration have I paid.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400247">47</span></span>He without
ligature, before making incision in the neck.  
  Closed up the wound again, most wealthy Bounteous Lord who  
   healeth the dissevered parts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400248">48</span></span>Let him
flash gloom away from us, the blue, the yellow and the  
   red.  
  I fasten to this pillar here the burning pest Prishātaki.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400249">49</span></span>All
witcheries that hang about this garment, all royal Varuna's

  All failure of success and all misfortunes here I deposit fastened  
   to the pillar.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400250">50</span></span>My body
that I hold most dear trembles in terror at this robe.

hems and borders all the threads that form the web  
   and woof. <span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

Brihaspati hath loosed the Visve Devas keep secure.  
  With all the vigour that is stored in cows do we enrich this girl.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400257">57</span></span>Her whom
Brihaspati, etc.  
  With all the milky store possessed by cows do we enrich this  
   girl.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400258">58</span></span>Her whom
Brihaspati hath freed the Visve Devas keep secure.  
  With all the store of sap that cows contain do we enrich this.  
   girl.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400259">59</span></span>If, wearing
long loose hair, these men have danced together in  
   thy house, committing sin with shout and cry,  
  May Agni free thee from that guilt, may Savitar deliver thee,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400260">60</span></span>If in thy
house thy daughter here have wept, with wild dishevel-  
   led locks, committing sin with her lament.  
  May Agni, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400261">61</span></span>If the
bride's sisters, if young maids have danced together in thy  
   house, committing sin with shout and cry.  
  May Agni free thee from that guilt, may Savitar deliver thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400262">62</span></span>If any evil
have been wrought by mischief-makers that affects  
   thy cattle progeny or house,  
  May Agni free thee from the woe, may Savitar deliver thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400263">63</span></span>This woman
utters wish and prayer, as down she casts the husks  
   of corn:  
  Long live my lord and master! yea, a hundred autumns let him  
   live!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400264">64</span></span>Join thou
this couple, Indra! like the Chakravaka and his.  
   mate:  
  May they attain to full old age with children in their happy  
   home. <span id="page_145">p. 145</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400265">65</span></span>Whatever
magic hath been wrought on cushion, chair, or  
   canopy.  
  Each spell to mar the wedding rites, all this we throw into the  
   bath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400266">66</span></span>Whatever
fault or error was in marriage or in bridal pomp.  
  This woe we wipe away upon the cloak the interceder wears.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400267">67</span></span>We, having
laid the stain and fault upon the interceder's cloak,  
  Are pure and meet for sacrifice. May he prolong our lives for  
   us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400268">68</span></span>Now let
this artificial comb, wrought with a hundred teeth,  
   remove  
  Aught of impurity that dims the hair upon this woman's head.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400269">69</span></span>We take
away consumption from each limb and member of the  
   bride.  
  Let not this reach Earth, nor the Gods in heaven, let it not reach  
   the sky or air's wide region.  
  Let not this dust that sullies reach the Waters, nor Yama, Agni,  
   nor the host of Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400270">70</span></span>With all
the milk that is in Earth I gird thee, with all the milk  
   that Plants contain I dress thee.  
  I gird thee round with children and with riches. Do thou, thus  
   girt, receive the offered treasure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400271">71</span></span>I am this
man, that dame art thou I am the psalm and thou the  
   verse. I am the heaven and thou the earth.  
  So will we dwell together here, parents of children yet to be.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400272">72</span></span>Unmarried
men desire to wed; bountiful givers wish for sons.  
  Together may we dwell with strength unscathed for high pros-  
   perity.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400273">73</span></span>May they,
the Fathers who, to view the bride, have joined this  
   nuptial train,  
  Grant to this lady and her lord children and peaceful happiness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400274">74</span></span>Her who
first guided by a rein came hither, giving the bride, here  
   offspring and possessions,  
  Let them convey along the future's pathway. Splendid, with  
   noble children, she hath conquered.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1400275">75</span></span>Wake to
long life, watchful and understanding, yea, to a life shall  
   last a hundred autumns  
  Enter the house to be the household's mistress. A long long life  
   let Savitar vouchsafe thee.
