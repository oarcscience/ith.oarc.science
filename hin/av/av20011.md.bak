### HYMN XI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001101">1</span></span>Fort-render,
Lord of Wealth, dispelling foemen, Indra with  
   lightnings hath o'ercome the Dāsa.  
  Impelled by prayer and waxen great in body, he hath filled  
   earth and heaven, the bounteous Giver.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001102">2</span></span>I stimulate
this zeal, the Strong, the Hero, decking my song of  
   praise for thee Immortal.  
  O Indra, thou art equally the leader of heavenly hosts and  
   human generations.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001103">3</span></span>Leading his
band Indra encompassed Vritra; weak grew the wily  
   leader enchanters.  
  He who burns fierce in forests slaughtered Vyansa, and made  
   the milch-kine of nights apparent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001104">4</span></span>Indra,
light-winner, days' creator, conquered, as guardian, hostile  
   bands with those who loved him.  
  For man the days' bright ensign he illumined, and found the  
   light for his great joy and gladness. <span id="page_271">p.
271</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001105">5</span></span>Forward to
fiercely falling blows pressed Indra, hero-like doing  
   many hero exploits.  
  Those holy songs he taught the bard who praised him, and  
   widely spread these Dawns' resplendent colour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001106">6</span></span>They laud
the mighty acts of him the mighty, the many glorious  
   deeds performed by Indra.  
  He in his strength, with all-surpassing prowess, through wond-  
   rous arts crushed the malignant Dasyus.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001107">7</span></span>Lord of the
brave, Indra who rules the people gave freedom to  
   the Gods by might and battle.  
  Wise singers glorify with chanted praises these his achievements  
   in Vivasvān's dwelling.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001108">8</span></span>Excellent,
conqueror, the victory-giver, the winner of the light  
   and godlike waters,  
  He who hath won this broad earth and this heaven,—in Indra  
   they rejoice who love devotions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001109">9</span></span>He gained
possession of the Sun and horses; Indra obtained  
   the cow who feedeth many.  
  Treasure of gold he won; he smote the Dasyus and gave protec-  
   tion to the race of Aryas.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001110">10</span></span>He took the
plants and days for his possession; he gained the  
   forest trees and air's mid-region.  
  Vala he cleft, and chased away opponents: thus was he tamer  
   of the overweening.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001111">11</span></span>Call we on
Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight  
   where spoil is gathered,  
  The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the  
  Vritras, wins and gathers treasures.
