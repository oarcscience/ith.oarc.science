Udumbara, enrich us: vouchsafe us wealth with all  
   good men about us. I bind thee on for increase of possessions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1903114">14</span></span>For hero is
this hero bound, Amulet of Udumbara.  
  So may he make our offering sweetly-savoured, and grant us  
   wealth with all good men about us.
