### HYMN I

#### A charm to recover a dying man

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800101">1</span></span>Homage to
Death the Ender! May thy breathings, inward and  
   outward, still remain within thee.  
  Here stay this man united with his spirit in the Sun's realm, the  
   world of life eternal!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800102">2</span></span>Bhaga hath
lifted up this man, and Soma with his filaments,  
  Indra and Agni, and the Gods the Maruts, raised him up to  
   health.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800103">3</span></span>Here is thy
spirit, here thy breath, here is thy life, here is thy  
   soul:  
  By a celestial utterance we raise thee from Destruction's bonds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800104">4</span></span>Up from this
place, O man, rise! sink not downward, casting  
   away the bonds of Death that hold thee.  
  Be not thou parted from this world, from sight of Agni and the  
  Sun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800105">5</span></span>Purely for
thee breathe Wind and Mātarisvan, and let the  
  Waters rain on thee their nectar.  
  The Sun shall shine with healing on thy body; Death shall have  
   mercy on thee: do not leave us!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800106">6</span></span>Upward must
be thy way, O man, not downward: with life and  
   mental vigour I endow thee.  
  Ascend this car eternal, lightly rolling; then full of years shalt  
   thou address the meeting.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800107">7</span></span>Let not thy
soul go thither, nor be lost to us: slight not the  
   living, go not where the Fathers are.  
  Let all the Gods retain thee here in safety.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800108">8</span></span>Yearn not
for the departed ones, for those who lead men far  
   away.  
  Rise up from darkness into light: come, both thy hands we  
   clasp in ours.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800109">9</span></span>Let not the
black dog and the brindled seize thee, two warders  
   of the way sent forth by Yama.  
  Come hither; do not hesitate: with mind averted stay not there. <span
id="page_a323">p. a323</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800110">10</span></span>Forbear to
tread this path, for it is awful: that path I speak of  
   which thou hast not travelled.  
  Enter it not, O man; this way is darkness: forward is danger,  
   hitherward is safety.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800111">11</span></span>Thy
guardians be the Fires within the Waters, thy guardian be  
   the Fire which men enkindle.  
  Thy guardian be Vaisvānara Jātavedas; let not celestial Fire with  
   lightning burn thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800112">12</span></span>Let not the
Flesh-Consumer plot against thee: depart thou far  
   away from the Destroyer.  
  Be Heaven and Earth and Sun and Moon thy keepers, and from  
   the dart of Gods may Air protect thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800113">13</span></span>May
Vigilance and Watchfulness protect thee, Sleepless and  
  Slumberless keep guard above thee!  
  Let Guardian and let Wakeful be thy warders.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800114">14</span></span>Let these
be thy preservers, these thy keepers. All hail to these,  
   to these be lowly worship!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800115">15</span></span>May saving
Savitar, Vāyu, Indra, Dhātar restore thee to com-  
   munion with the living.  
  Let not thy vigour or thy breath forsake thee: we recall thy life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800116">16</span></span>Let not the
fiend with snapping jaws, nor darkness find thee:  
   tongue, holy grass: how shouldst thou perish?  
  May the Ādityas and the Vasus, Indra and Agni raise thee and  
   to health restore thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800117">17</span></span>The Sky
hath raised thee, and the Earth, Prajāpati hath raised  
   thee up.  
  The Plants and Herbs with Soma as their King have rescued  
   thee from Death.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800118">18</span></span>Here let
this man, O Gods, remain: let him not go to yonder  
   world.  
  We rescue him from Mrityu with a charm that hath a thousand  
   powers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800119">19</span></span>I have
delivered thee from Death. Strength-givers smelt and  
   fashion thee!  
  Let not she-fiends with wild loose locks, or fearful howlers yell  
   at thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800120">20</span></span>I have
attained and captured thee: thou hast returned restored  
   to youth.  
  Perfect in body: so have I found all thy sight and all thy life. <span
id="page_a324">p. a324</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0800121">21</span></span>Life hath
breathed on thee; light hath come: darkness hath past  
   away from thee.  
  Far from thee we have buried Death, buried Destruction and:  
  Decline.
