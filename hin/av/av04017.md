### HYMN XVII

#### A charm to secure freedom from various evils

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401701">1</span></span>We seize and
hold thee, Conquering One! the queen of medi-  
   cines that heal.  
  O Plant, I have endowed thee with a hundred powers for every  
   man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401702">2</span></span>Still
conquering, banishing the curse, mighty, with thy reverted.  
   bloom.  
  Thee and all Plants have I invoked: Hence let it save us! was  
   my prayer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401703">3</span></span>She who hath
cursed us with a curse, or hath conceived a  
   murderous sin,  
  Or seized our son to take his blood, may she devour the child  
   she bare.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401704">4</span></span>What magic
they have wrought for thee in dish unbaked or  
   burnt dark-red,  
  What they have wrought in flesh undressed,—conquer the  
   sorcerers therewith.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401705">5</span></span>Ill dream
and wretchedness of life, Rākshasa, monster, stingy  
   hags,  
  All the she-fiends of evil name and voice, we drive away from  
   us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401706">6</span></span>Death caused
by famine, caused by thirst, failure of children,.  
   loss of kine,  
  With thee, O Apāmārga, all this ill we cleanse and wipe away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401707">7</span></span>Death caused
by thirst, death caused by stress of hunger, loss at  
   play with dice,  
  All this, O Apāmārga with thine aid we cleanse and wipe away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401708">8</span></span>The Apāmārga
is alone the sovran of all Plants that grow.  
  With this we wipe away whate'er hath fallen on thee: go in  
   health!
