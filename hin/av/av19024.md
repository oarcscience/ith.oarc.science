### HYMN XXIV

#### A benediction on a newly elected King

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902401">1</span></span>Do ye, O
Brāhmanaspati, invest for the royal sway this man.  
  With that wherewith the Deities invested Savitar the God.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902402">2</span></span>Invest this
Indra for long life, invest him for great princely  
   power,  
  That I may lead him on to eld, that the man watch his  
   princedom long.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902403">3</span></span>Invest this
Soma for long life, invest him for great hearing  
   power.  
  That I may lead him on to eld, that he may watch o'er hearing  
   long.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902404">4</span></span>For us,
surround him, cover him with splendour, give him long  
   life, and death when age removes him.  
  This garment hath Brihaspati presented to Soma, to the King,  
   to wrap about him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902405">5</span></span>Advance to
good old age: endue the mantle. Be thou our  
   heifers' guard from imprecation.  
  Live thou a hundred full and plenteous autumns, and wrap thee  
   in prosperity of riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902406">6</span></span>Thou for
weal hast clothed thee in this garment: thou hast  
   become our cows' sure guard from curses.  
  Live thou a hundred full and plenteous autumns: then living,  
   fair thyself, shalt deal forth treasures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1902407">7</span></span>In every
need, in every fray we call, as friends, to succour us,  
  Indra the mightiest of all.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1902408">8</span></span>Gold-coloured, undecaying, blest with
heroes, dwell, dying in  
   old age, with children round thee.  
  This is the spoken word of Agni, Soma, Brihaspati and Savitar,  
   and Indra.
