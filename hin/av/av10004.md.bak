### HYMN IV

#### A charm to destroy venomous serpents

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000402">2</span></span>The first of
all is Indra's car, next is the chariot of the Gods  
   the third is Varuna's alone.  
  The last, the Serpents' chariot, struck the pillar and then sped  
   away. <span id="page_12">p. 12</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000402">2</span></span>Their lustre
is the Darbha-grass, its young shoots are their  
   horse's tail: the reed's plume is their chariot seat.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000403">3</span></span>Strike out,
white courser! with thy foot, strike both with fore  
   and hinder foot,  
  Stay the dire poison of the Snakes, and make it weak as soaking  
   wood.  
  -4. Loud neighing he hath dived below, and rising up again replied,  
  Stayed the dire poison of the Snakes, and made it weak as  
   soaking wood.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000405">5</span></span>Paidva kills
Kasarnila, kills both the white Serpent and the  
   black,  
  Paidva hath struck and cleft in twain Ratharvi's and the Viper's  
   head.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000406">6</span></span>Go onward,
horse of Pedu! go thou first: we follow after thee.  
  Cast thou aside the Serpents from the pathway whereupon we  
   tread.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000407">7</span></span>Here was the
horse of Pedu born: this is the way that takes him  
   hence.  
  These are the tracks the courser left, the mighty slayer of the  
  Snakes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000408">8</span></span>Let him not
close the opened mouth, nor open that which now  
   is closed.  
  Two snakes are in this field, and both, female and male, are  
   powerless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000409">9</span></span>Powerless
are the serpents here, those that are near and those  
   afar.  
  I kill the scorpion with a club, and with a staff the new-come  
   snake.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000410">10</span></span>This is the
remedy against Aghāsva and the adder, both:  
  Indra and Paidva have subdued and tamed the vicious snake for  
   me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000411">11</span></span>We fix our
thoughts on Pedu's horse, strong, off-spring of a  
   stedfast line.  
  Behind our backs the vipers here crouch down and lie in wait  
   for us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000412">12</span></span>Bereft of
life and poison they lie slain by bolt-armed Indra's  
   hand. Indra and we have slaughtered them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000400">0</span></span>13.
Tiraschirājis have been slain, and vipers crushed and brayed to  
   bits. <span id="page_13">p. 13</span>  
  Slay Darvi in the Darbha-grass, Karikrata, and White and  
  Black.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000414">14</span></span>The young
maid of Kirāta race, a little damsel, digs the drug,  
  Digs it with shovels wrought of gold on the high ridges of the  
   hills.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000415">15</span></span>Hither the
young uuconquered leech who slays the speckled  
   snake hath come.  
  He verily demolishes adder and scorpion; both of them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000416">16</span></span>Indra,
Mitra and Varuna, and Vāta and Parjanya both have  
   given the serpent up to me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000417">17</span></span>Indra hath
given him up to me, the female viper and the male,  
  The adder, him with stripes athwart. Kasarnila, Dasonasi.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000418">18</span></span>O Serpent,
Indra hath destroyed the sire who first engendered  
   thee:  
  And when these snakes are pierced and bored what sap and  
   vigour will be theirs?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000419">19</span></span>Their heads
have I seized firmly as a fisher grasps the spotted  
   prey,  
  Waded half through the stream and washed the poison of the  
   serpents off.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000420">20</span></span>Let the
floods hurry on and bear the poison of all snakes afar.  
  Tiraschirājis have been slain and vipers crushed and brayed to  
   bits.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000421">21</span></span>As from the
salutary plants I deftly pick the fibres out, And  
   guide them skilfully like mares, so let thy venom, Snake!  
   depart,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000422">22</span></span>All poison
that the sun and fire, all that the earth and plants  
   contain,  
  Poison of most effectual power—let all thy venom pass away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000423">23</span></span>Serpents
which fire or plants have generated, those which have  
   sprung from waters or the lightning,  
  Whose mighty broods are found in many places, these serpents  
   we will reverently worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000424">24</span></span>Thou art a
maid called Taudi, or Ghritāchi is thy name. Thy  
   place;  
  Is underneath my foot. I take the poison-killing remedy.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000425">25</span></span>From every
member drive away the venom, and avoid the heart.  
  Then let the poison's burning heat pass downward and away-  
   from thee. <span id="page_14">p. 14</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000426">26</span></span>The bane
hath fled afar. It wept, and asked the poison how it  
   fared.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000427">27</span></span>Agni hath
found the venom of the serpent, Soma drawn it out.  
  Back to the biter hath returned the poison, and the snake hath  
   died.
