### HYMN IX

#### A prayer to Pūshan for protection and the recovery of lost property

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700901">1</span></span>Pūshan was
born to move on distant pathways, on roads remote  
   from earth, remote from heaven.  
  To both most lovely places of assembly he travels and returns  
   with perfect knowledge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700902">2</span></span>Pūshan knows
all these realms: may he conduct us by ways that  
   are most free from fear and danger.  
  Giver of blessings, glowing, all heroic, may he the wise and  
   watchful go before us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700903">3</span></span>We are thy
praisers here, O Pūshan: never let us be injured  
   under thy protection.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700904">4</span></span>From out the
distance, far and wide, may Pūshan stretch his  
   right hand forth.  
  Let him drive back our lost to us, let us return with what is lost.
