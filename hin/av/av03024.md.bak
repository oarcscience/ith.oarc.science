### HYMN XXIV

#### A song of harvest

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302401">1</span></span>The plants
of earth are rich in milk, and rich in milk is this  
   my word,  
  So from the rich in milk I bring thousandfold profit hitherward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302402">2</span></span>Him who is
rich in milk I know. Abundant hath he made our  
   corn.  
  The God whose name is Gatherer, him we invoke who dwelleth  
   in his house who sacrifices not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302403">3</span></span>All the five
regions of the heavens, all the five races of man-  
   kind,  
  As after rain the stream brings drift, let them bring increase  
   hitherward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302404">4</span></span>Open the
well with hundred streams, exhaustless, with a thousand  
   streams.  
  So cause this corn of ours to be exhaustless, with a thousand  
   streams.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302405">5</span></span>O
Hundred-handed, gather up. O Thousand-handed, pour thou  
   forth.  
  Bring hither increase of the corn prepared and yet to be pre-  
   pared.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302406">6</span></span>Three
sheaves are the Gandharvas' claim, the lady of the house  
   hath four.  
  We touch thee with the sheaf that is the most abundant of them  
   all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302407">7</span></span>Adding and
Gathering are thy two attendants, O Prajāpati.  
  May they bring hither increase, wealth abundant, inexhaustible.
