### HYMN V

#### A glorification of a sacrificial goat

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900501">1</span></span>Seize him
and bring him hither. Let him travel. foreknowing, to  
   the regions of the pious.  
  Crossing in many a place the mighty darkness, let the Goat  
   mount to the third heaven above us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900502">2</span></span>I bring thee
hither as a share for Indra; prince, at this sacrifice,.  
   for him who worships.  
  Grasp firmly from behind all those who hate us: so let the sacri-  
   ficer's men be sinless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900503">3</span></span>Wash from
his feet all trace of evil-doing: foreknowing, with  
   cleansed hooves let him go upward.  
  Gazing on many a spot, crossing the darkness, let the Goat  
   mount to the third heaven above us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900504">4</span></span>Cut up this
skin with the grey knife, Dissector! dividing joint  
   from joint, and mangle nothing  
  Do him no injury: limb by limb arrange him, and send him up  
   to the third cope of heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900505">5</span></span>With verse
upon the fire I set the caldron: pour in the water;  
   lay him down within it! <span id="page_a369">p. a369</span>  
  Encompass him with fire, ye Immolators. Cooked, let him reach  
   the world where dwell the righteous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900506">6</span></span>Hence come
thou forth, vexed by no pain or torment. Mount to  
   the third heaven from the heated vessel.  
  As fire out of the fire hast thou arisen. Conquer and win this  
   lucid world of splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900507">7</span></span>The Goat is
Agni: light they call him, saying that living man  
   must give him to the Brāhman.  
  Given in this world by a devout believer, the Goat dispels and  
   drives afar the darkness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900508">8</span></span>Let the
Panchaudana Goat, about to visit the three lights, pass  
   away in five divisions.  
  Go midst the pious who have paid their worship, and parted,  
   dwell on the third cope of heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900509">9</span></span>Rise to that
world, O Goat, where dwell the righteous: pass, like  
   a Sarabha veiled, all difficult places.  
  The Goat Panchaudana, given to a Brāhman, shall with all ful-  
   ness satisfy the giver.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900510">10</span></span>The Goat
Panchaudana, given to a Brāhman, sets the bestower  
   on the pitch of heaven,  
  In the third vault, third sky, third ridge. One only Cow omni-  
   form art thou, that yields all wishes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900511">11</span></span>That is the
third light that is yours, ye Fathers. He gives the  
  Goat Panchaudana to the Brāhman.  
  Given in this world by the devout believer, the Goat dispels and  
   drives afar the darkness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900512">12</span></span>Seeking the
world of good men who have worshipped, he gives  
   the Goat Panchaudana to the Brāhman.  
  Win thou this world as thy complete possession. Auspicious  
   unto us be he, accepted!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900513">13</span></span>Truly the
Goat sprang from the glow of Agni, inspired as sage  
   with all a sage's power.  
  Sacrifice, filled, filled full, offered with Vashat—this let the
Gods  
   arrange.at proper seasons.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900514">14</span></span>Home-woven
raiment let him give, and gold as guerdon to the  
   priests.  
  So he obtains completely all celestial and terrestrial worlds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900515">15</span></span>Near to
thee, Goat! approach these streams of Soma, divine,  
   distilling meath, bedecked with butter! <span id="page_a370">p.
a370</span>  
  Stay thou the earth and sky and fix them firmly up on the seven-  
   rayed pitch and height of heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900516">16</span></span>Unborn art
thou, O Goat: to heaven thou goest. Though thee  
  Angirases knew that radiant region.  
  So may I know that holy world.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900517">17</span></span>Convey our
sacrifice to heaven, that it may reach the Gods, with  
   that  
  Whereby thou, Agni, bearest wealth in thousands, and all pre-  
   cious things.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900518">18</span></span>The Goat
Panchaudana, when cooked, transporteth, repelling  
  Nirriti, to the world of Svarga.  
  By him may we win worlds which Sūrya brightens.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900519">19</span></span>The
droppings of the Odanas attending the Goat which I have  
   lodged with priest or people  
  May all this know us in the world of virtue, O Agni, at the  
   meeting of the pathways.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900520">20</span></span>This Unborn
cleft apart in the beginning: his breast became the  
   earth, his back was heaven.  
  His middle was the air, his sides the regions; the hollows of his  
   belly formed both oceans.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900521">21</span></span>His eyes
were Truth and Right. The whole together was Truth:  
  Virāj his head and Faith his breathing.  
  This Goat Panchaudana was indeed a sacrifice unlimited.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900522">22</span></span>A boundless
sacrifice he performs, he wins himself a boundless  
   world:  
  Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with a priestly fee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900523">23</span></span>Let him not
break the victim's bones, let him not suck the  
   marrow out.  
  Let the man, taking him entire, here, even here deposit him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900524">24</span></span>This, even
this is his true form: the man uniteth him therewith.  
  Food, greatness, strength he bringeth him who giveth the Goat  
  Panchaudana illumed with guerdon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900525">25</span></span>The five
gold pieces, and the five new garments, and the five  
   milch-kine yield him all his wishes.  
  Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with a priestly  
   fee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900526">26</span></span>The five
gold pieces, area light to light him, robes become armour  
   to defend his body;  
  He winneth Svarga as his home who giveth the Goat Panchaud-  
   ana illumed with bountry. <span id="page_a371">p. a371</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900527">27</span></span>When she
who hath been wedded finds a second husband after-  
   ward,  
  The twain shall not be parted if they give the Goat Panchaud-  
   ana.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900528">28</span></span>One world
with the re-wedded wife becomes the second hus-  
   band's home.  
  Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with the priestly fee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900529">29</span></span>They who
have given a cow who drops a calf each season, or an  
   ox,  
  A coverlet, a robe, or gold, go to the loftiest sphere of heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900530">30</span></span>Himself,
the father and the son, the grandson, and the father's  
   sire,  
  Mother, wife, her who bore his babes, all the beloved ones I call.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900531">31</span></span>The man who
knows the season named the Scorching—the Goat  
  Pafichaudana is this scorching season  
  He lives himself, he verily burns up his hated rival's fame,  
  Who gives the Goat Panchaudana illumined with the priestly  
   fee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900532">32</span></span>The man who
knows the season called the Working takes to  
   himself the active fame, his hated rival's active fame.  
  The Goat Panchaudana is this Working season.  
  He lives himself, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900533">33</span></span>The man who
knows the season called the Meeting takes to him-  
   self the gathering fame, his hated rival's gathering fame.  
  The Goat Panchaudana is this Meeting season.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900534">34</span></span>The man who

   swelling fame, his hated rival's swelling fame.

  He lives himself, etc.

the Goat and the five boiled rice messes. May the uni-  
   ted Quarters, all accordant, and intermediate points, accept  
   him from thee. <span id="page_a372">p. a372</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900538">38</span></span>May these
preserve him for thee. Here I offer t o these the molten
