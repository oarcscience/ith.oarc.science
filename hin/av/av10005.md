### HYMN V

#### A charm to overthrow a rival and gain strength, dignity, long life, children, and general prosperity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000501">1</span></span>Ye are the
power of Indra, ye the force and strength of Indra,  
   ye his hero might and manliness.  
  I join you with the bonds of Prayer to the victorious enterprise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000506">6</span></span>For the
victorious enterprise let all creation stand by me. For  
   me ye, Waters, are prepared. <span id="page_15">p. 15</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000507">7</span></span>Ye are the
share of Agni. Grant, O heavenly Waters unto us the  
  Waters' brilliant energy.  
  By statute of Prajāpati I set you down for this our world.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000515">15</span></span>Waters,
your ceremonial share of Waters which the waters hold,  
   which aids our sacrifice to Gods,  
  This as a remnant here I leave. Do not thou wash it clean away.  
  With this we let the man go by who hates us and whom we  
   abhor.  
  Him would I fain o'erthrow and slay with this our ceremonial  
   act, with this our prayer, our thunder-bolt.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000522">22</span></span>Whatever
evil I have done within this last triennium,  
  From all that woe and misery let the waters shield and guard  
   me well.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000523">23</span></span>Onward I
urge your gathered floods: enter your own abiding-  
   place,  
  Uninjured and with all your strength. Let nothing bend or bow  
   us down.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000524">24</span></span>May the
pure Waters cleanse us from defilement,  
  Fair to behold remove our sin and trouble, and bear away ill-  
   dream and all pollution.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000525">25</span></span>Thou art
the step of Vishnu, rival-slayer, sharpened by earth,  
   aglow with fire of Agni,  
  Earth have I ranged: from earth we bar him who hates us and  
   whom we hate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000526">26</span></span>Ours is
superior place and ours is conquest: may I in all fights  
   tread down spite and malice.  
  Let him not live, let vital breath desert him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000536">36</span></span>With this I
here invest the power and splendour, the life of that  
   man and his vital breathing, the son of such a sire and such a  
   woman, here do I overthrow and cast him downward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000537">37</span></span>I follow
Sūrya's course in heaven, the course that takes him to  
   the South.  
  May that bestow upon me wealth and glory of a Brāhman's  
   rank.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000538">38</span></span>I turn me
to the regions bright with splendour.  
  May they bestow upon me wealth and glory of a Brāhman's  
   rank.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000539">39</span></span>I turn me
to the Rishis Seven. May they, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000540">40</span></span>I turn me
unto Prayer. May that, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000541">41</span></span>I turn me
unto Brāhmans. May they etc. <span id="page_16">p. 16</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000542">42</span></span>We hunt
that man, we beat him down and slay him with our  
   murderous blows.  
  We with the spell have hurried him to Parameshthin's opened  
   jaws.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000543">43</span></span>Let the
shot missile catch him with Vaisvānara's two mighty  
   fangs.  
  This offering, and the mightiest Goddess, the Fuel, eat him up!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000544">44</span></span>Thou art
the bound of Varuna the King.  
  Bind, such an one, the son of such a woman, in vital breath and  
   in the food that feeds him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000545">45</span></span>All food of
thine, O Lord of Life, that lies, upon the face of  
   earth,  
  Thereof bestow thou upon us. O Lord of Life, Prajāpati!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000546">46</span></span>Celestial
Waters have I sought: with juice have I besprinkled  
   them.  
  With milk, O Agni, have I come; bestow upon me splendid  
   strength.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000547">47</span></span>Give me the
boon of splendid strength; give, Agni! progeny  
   and life.  
  May the Gods know this prayer of mine, may Indra with the  
  Rishis know.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000548">48</span></span>What curse
soever couples launch against us, whatever bitter  
   speech the chatterers utter,  
  With Manyu's arrow, offspring of the spirit, transfix thou to the  
   heart the Yātudhānas,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000549">49</span></span>Destroy the
Yātudhānas with thy fervour, consume the demons  
   with thy wrath, O Agni.  
  Destroy the fool's gods with thy fiery splendour, destroy the  
   blazing ones, the insatiable.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_1000550">50</span></span>Well-skilled, against this man I hurl
the Water's bolt with four  
   spikes, to cleave his head asunder.  
  May it destroy all members of his body. Let the whole host of  
  Gods approve my purpose.
