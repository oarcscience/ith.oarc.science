### HYMN IV

#### On the duty of giving cows to Brāhmans, and the sin and danger of withholding the gift

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200401">1</span></span>Give the
gift, shall be his word: and straightway they have bound  
   the Cow  
  For Brāhman priests who beg the boon. That bringeth sons and  
   progeny.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200402">2</span></span>He trades
and traffics with his sons, and in his cattle suffers loss.  
  Who will not give the Cow of Gods to Rishis children when  
   they beg.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200403">3</span></span>They perish
through a hornless cow, a lame cow sinks them in a  
   pit.  
  Through a maimed cow his house is burnt: a one-eyed cow  
   destroys his wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200404">4</span></span>Fierce fever
where her droppings fall attacks the master of the  
   kine.  
  So have they named her Vasa, for thou art called uncontrollable.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200405">5</span></span>The malady
Viklindu springs on him from ground whereon she  
   stands,  
  And suddenly, from fell disease, perish the men on whom she  
   sniffs.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200406">6</span></span>Whoever
twitches up her ears is separated from the Gods.  
  He deems he makes a mark, but he diminishes his wealth  
   thereby.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200407">7</span></span>If to his
own advantage one applies the long hair of her tail, <span
id="page_98">p. 98</span>  
  His colts, in consequence thereof. die, and the wolf destroys his  
   calves.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200408">8</span></span>If, while
her master owneth her, a carrion crow hath harmed her  
   hair,  
  His young boys die thereof, Decline o'ertakes them after fell  
   disease.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200409">9</span></span>What time
the Dāsi woman throws lye on the droppings of the  
  Cow,  
  Misshapen birth arises thence, inseparable from that sin.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200410">10</span></span>For Gods
and Brāhmans is the Cow produced when first she  
   springs to life,  
  Hence to the priests must she be given: this they call guarding  
   private wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200411">11</span></span>The
God-created Cow belongs to those who come to ask for  
   her.  
  They call it outrage on the priests when one retains her as his  
   own.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200412">12</span></span>He who
withholds the Cow of Gods from Rishis' sons who ask  
   the gift  
  Is made an alien to the Gods, and subject to the Brāhmans'  
   wrath:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200413">13</span></span>Then let
him seek another Cow, whate'er his profit be in this.  
  The Cow, not given, harms a man when he denies her at their  
   prayer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200414">14</span></span>Like a rich
treasure stored away in safety is the Brāhmans' Cow.  
  Therefore men come to visit her, with whomsoever she is born.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200415">15</span></span>So when the
Brāhmans come unto the Cow they come unto their  
   own.  
  For this is her withholding, to oppress these in another life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200416">16</span></span>Thus after
three years may she go, speaking what is not under-  
   stood.  
  He, Nārads! would know the Cow, then Brāhmans must be  
   sought unto.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200417">17</span></span>Whoso calls
her a worthless Cow, the stored-up treasure of the  
  Gods,  
  Bhava and Sarva, both of them, move round and shoot a shaft  
   at him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200418">18</span></span>The man who
hath no knowledge of her udder and the teats  
   thereof, <span id="page_99">p. 99</span>  
  She yields him milk with these, if he hath purposed to bestow  
   the Cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200419">19</span></span>If he
withholds the Cow they beg, she lies rebellious in his stall.  
  Vain are the wishes and the hopes which he, withholding her,  
   would gain.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200420">20</span></span>The Deities
have begged the Cow, using the Brāhman as their  
   mouth:  
  The man who gives her not incurs the enmity of all the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200421">21</span></span>Withholding
her from Brāhmans, he incurs the anger of the  
   beasts,  
  When mortal man appropriates the destined portion of the  
  Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200422">22</span></span>If hundred
other Brāhmans beg the Cow of him who owneth  
   her,  
  The Gods have said, She, verily, belongs to him who knows the  
   truth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200423">23</span></span>Whoso to
others, not to him who hath this knowledge, gives the  
  Cow,  
  Earth, with the Deities, is hard for him to win and rest upon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200424">24</span></span>The Deities
begged the Cow from him with whom at first she  
   was produced:  
  Her, this one, Nārada would know: with Deities he drove her  
   forth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200425">25</span></span>The Cow
deprives of progeny and makes him poor in cattle who  
  Retains in his possession her whom Brāhmans have solicited.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200426">26</span></span>For Agni
and for Soma, for Kāma, Mitra and Varuna,  
  For these the Brāhmans ask: from these is he who giveth not  
   estranged.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200427">27</span></span>Long as her
owner hath not heard, himself, the verses, let her  
   move  
  Among his kine: when he hath heard, let her not make her  
   home with him;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200428">28</span></span>He who hath
heard her verses and still makes her roam among  
   his kine.  
  The Gods in anger rend away his life and his prosperity  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200429">29</span></span>Roaming in
many a place the Cow is the stored treasure of the  
  Gods,  
  Make manifest thy shape and form when she would seek her  
   dwelling-place. <span id="page_100">p. 100</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200430">30</span></span>Her shape
and form she manifests when she would seek her  
   dwelling-place;  
  Then verily the Cow attends to Brāhman priests and their  
   request.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200431">31</span></span>This
thought he settles in his mind. This safely goeth to the  
  Gods.  
  Then verily the Brāhman priests approach that they may beg the  
  Cow  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200432">32</span></span>By Svadhā
to the Fathers, by sacrifice to the Deities,  
  By giving them the Cow, the Prince doth not incur the mother's.  
   wrath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200433">33</span></span>The
Prince's mother is the Cow: so was it ordered from of old.  
  She, when bestowed upon the priests, cannot be given back, they  
   say.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200434">34</span></span>As molten
butter, held at length, drops down to Agni from the  
   scoop,  
  So falls away from Agni he who gives no Cow to Brāhman  
   priests.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200435">35</span></span>Good
milker, with rice-cake as calf, she in the world comes  
   nigh to him,  
  To him who gave her as a gift the Cow grants every hope and.  
   wish.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200436">36</span></span>In Yama's
realm the Cow fulfils each wish for him who gave her  
   up;  
  But hell, they say, is for the man who, when they beg, bestow  
   her not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200437">37</span></span>Enraged
against her owner roams the Cow when she hath been  
   impregned.  
  He deemed me fruitless is her thought; let him be bound in,  
   snares of Death!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200438">38</span></span>Whoever
looking on the Cow as fruitless, cooks her flesh at  
   home,  
  Brihaspati compels his sons and children of his sons to beg.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200439">39</span></span>Downward
she sends a mighty heat, though amid kine a Cow  
   she roams.  
  Poison she yields for him who owns and hath not given her away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200440">40</span></span>The animal
is happy when it is bestowed upon the priests:  
  But happy is the Cow when she is made a sacrifice to Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200441">41</span></span>Nārada
chose the terrible Vilipti out of all the cows Which the <span
id="page_101">p. 101</span>  
  Gods formed and framed when they had risen up from sacri-  
   fice  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200442">42</span></span>The Gods
considered her in doubt whether she were a Cow or  
   not.  
  Mirada spake of her and said, The veriest Cow of cows is she.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200443">43</span></span>How many
cows, O Nārada, knowest thou, born among man-  
   kind  
  I ask thee who dost know, of which must none who is no  
  Brāhman eat?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200444">44</span></span>Vilipti,
cow, and she who drops no second calf, Brihaspati!  
  Of these none not a Brāhmana should eat if he hope for emi-  
   nence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200445">45</span></span>Homage, O
Nārada, to thee who hast quick knowledge of the  
   cows.  
  Which of these is the direst, whose withholding bringeth death  
   to man?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200446">46</span></span>Vilipti, O
Brihaspati, cow, mother of no second calf—Of these  
   none not a Brāhman should eat if he hope for eminence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200447">47</span></span>Threefold
are kine, Vilipti, cow, the mother of no seeond calf:  
  These one should give to priests, and he will not offend Prajā-  
   pati.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200448">48</span></span>This
Brāhmans! is your sacrifice: thus should one think when he  
   is asked,  
  What time they beg from him the Cow fearful in the with-  
   holder's house.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200449">49</span></span>He gave her
not to us, so spake the Gods, in anger, of the Cow.  
  With these same verses they addressed Bheda: this brought  
   him to his death.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200450">50</span></span>Solicited
by Indra, still Bheda refused to give this Cow.  
  In strife for victory the Gods destroyed him for that sin of his.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200451">51</span></span>The men of
evil counsel who advise refusal of the Cow,  
  Miscreants, through their foolishness, are subjected to Indra's  
   wrath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200452">52</span></span>They who
seduce the owner of the Cow and say, Bestow her  
   not.  
  Encounter through their want of sense the missile shot by  
  Rudra's hand.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200453">53</span></span>If in his
home one cooks the Cow, sacrificed or not sacrificed.  
  Wronger of Gods and Brāhmans' he departs, dishonest, from  
   the world.
