### HYMN XXVI

#### A benediction on homeward coming cattle

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202601">1</span></span>Let them
come home, the cattle that have wandered, whom Vāyu  
   hath delighted to attend on,  
  Whose forms and figures are well known to Tvashtar. These cows  
   let Savitar drive within this stable.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202602">2</span></span>Let the
beasts stream together to this cow-pen. Brihaspati who  
   knoweth lead them hither!  
  Let Sinivāli guide the foremost homeward. When they have  
   come, Anumati! enclose them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202603">3</span></span>Together
stream the cattle! stream together horses and the  
   men!  
  Hitherward press all growth of grain! I offer sacrifice with mixt  
   oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202604">4</span></span>I pour
together milk of kine, with butter blending strength and  
   juice.  
  Well sprinkled be our men, as true to me as cows are to their  
   herd! <span id="page_a53">p. a53</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202605">5</span></span>Hither I
bring the milk of cows, hither have brought the juice  
   of corn.  
  Hitherward have our men been brought, hitherward to this  
   house our wives.
