# BOOK IV

### HYMN I

#### Cosmogonical and mystico-theological doctrine

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400101">1</span></span>Eastward at
first the prayer was generated: Vena disclosed bright  
   flashes from the summit,  
  Disclosed his deepest, nearest revelations, womb of the non-  
   existent and existent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400102">2</span></span>Let this
Queen come in front, her Father's daughter, found in  
   the worlds for earliest generation.  
  For him they set this radiant vault in motion. Let them prepare  
   warm milk for him who first would drink.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400103">3</span></span>He who was
born as his all-knowing kinsman declareth all the  
   deities' generations.  
  He from the midst of prayer his prayer hath taken. On high,  
   below, spread forth his godlike nature.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400104">4</span></span>For he, true
to the law of Earth and Heaven, established both  
   the mighty worlds securely.  
  Mighty when born, he propped apart the mighty, the sky, our  
   earthly home, and air's mid-region.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400105">5</span></span>He from the
depth hath been reborn for ever, Brihaspati the  
   world's sole Lord and Ruler.  
  From light was born the Day with all its lustre: through this  
   let sages live endowed with splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400106">6</span></span>The sage and
poet verily advanceth the statute of that mighty  
  God primeval.  
  He was born here with many more beside him: they slumbered  
   when the foremost side was opened.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400107">7</span></span>The man who
seeks the friend of Gods, Atharvan the father,  
   and Brihaspati, with worship,  
  Crying to him, Be thou all things' creator! the wise God, self-  
   dependent, never injures.
