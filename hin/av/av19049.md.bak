### HYMN XLIX

#### A hymn of Praise and prayer to Night

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904901">1</span></span>Friend of
the home, the strong and youthful maiden, Night, dear  
   to Savitar the God, and Bhaga,  
  All-compassing, all-glorious, prompt to listen, hath with her  
   greatness filled the earth and heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904902">2</span></span>Over all
depths hath she gone up, and mounted, most mighty  
  One, the sky's exalted summit.  
  Over me now the loving Night is spreading with her auspicious.  
  Godlike ways like Mitra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904903">3</span></span>Excellent,
high-born, blissful, meet for worship, Night, thou hast  
   come: stay here with friendly spirit.  
  Guard us, the food for men that we have gotten, and all pro-  
   sperity that comes of cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904904">4</span></span>With eager
haste hath Night assumed the vigour of leopard,.  
   tiger, or of tawny lion,  
  The horse's neighing and the wild-man's bellow, Thou takest  
   many a form when thou appearest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904905">5</span></span>Kind through
the Night be absence of the sunshine: Mother of  
  Frost, may she be swift to hear us.  
  Take notice of the hymn, thou highly favoured, wherewith I  
   worship thee in all the regions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904906">6</span></span>Even as a
King, O splendid Night, thou takest pleasure in our  
   hymn.  
  May we through Mornings as they flush have all our good men,  
   round us, and become possessors of all wealth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904907">7</span></span>Yes, Rāmyā
is the name thou hast assumed. The men who fain.  
   would spoil.  
  My wealth do thou annoy, O Night, that not one robber may  
   appear, none may a second time appear.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904908">8</span></span>Thou like a
well-wrought cup, O Night, art lovely: thou, a.  
   young maid, art formed in perfect beauty.  
  Thou lovingly, for me with eyes to se: them, hast bound on thee  
   heaven's stars as thine adornment. <span id="page_252">p.
252</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904909">9</span></span>Whatever
robber comes to-day, mischievous mortal enemy.  
  Let Night go forth, encounter him, and smite away his neck and  
   head;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1904910">10</span></span>His feet
that he may walk no more, his hands that he may do  
   no harm.  
  The robber who comes hitherward goes crushed and mutilated  
   hence,  
  Goes hence, goes far away from us, goes hence and bears no  
   spoil away.
