This is a translation of an abridged version of the Garuda Purana. The
Garuda Purana is one of the Vishnu Puranas. It is in the form of a
dialog between Vishnu and Garuda, the King of Birds. The second section
of this Purana (given here) deals with issues connected with death,
particularly funeral rites and the metaphysics of reincarnation.
Portions of the Garuda Purana are used by some Hindus as funeral
liturgy. Indeed, some consider it unlucky to read this text except
during funerals.

Of interest are the intermediate states between birth and rebirth, which
roughly correspond to the western concepts of Hell and Heaven. Since
this was written during the medieval era, it is possible that the writer
of this text had contact with Christianity. Earlier Hindu texts do not
elaborate about 'hell' and 'heaven,' at least not to this extent, and
the subject is completely absent in the oldest texts. Here, the torments
of Hell are described in terms that would not be out of place in a
Baptist revival tent (or Dante, for that matter). In addition, the
four-square city of Yama, the God of Death, is reminiscent of the
heavenly city in Revelation. However, these are way stations between
incarnations (or, as termed in the Tibetan Book of the Dead, *Bardos*),
not a permanent destination.

The Garuda Purana starts with the details of the afterlife. Following
this is an account of funeral procedures, including rituals, the
astrological timing of the post-death observances, and ritual gifts.
Balancing the extended vision of Hell in the earlier part of the
document is a shorter account of the City of Yama. After that is an
enumeration of correspondences between the macrocosmos and the human
body. The final part of this text is an appeal to self-knowledge as the
key to liberation, going beyond austerities and study of the texts. "The
fool, not knowing that the truth is seated in himself, is bewildered by
the Shastras,--a foolish goatherd, with the young goat under his arm,
peers into the well."
