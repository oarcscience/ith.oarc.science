### CHAPTER XVI.

#### An Account of the Law for Liberation.

1-4. Garuḍa said: I have heard from you, O Ocean of compassion, about
the transmigrating of the individual, through ignorance, in the worlds
of change. I now wish to hear about the means for eternal liberation.

O Lord, O Ruler of the Shining Ones, compassionate to those who seek
refuge,--in this terrible world of change, in the unsubstantial, in all
deep miseries,

The endless multitudes of individuals, placed in various kinds of
bodies, are born and die--of them no end is known.

Always miserable in this world, no one is ever known to be happy. O Lord
of Liberation, tell me by what means they may obtain release, O Lord.

5-7. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O Tārkṣya, and I will explain to you
what you have asked, even by the hearing of which a man is released from
the world of change.

There is a Shining One, Śiva, who has the nature of Supreme Brāhmaṇ, who
is partless, all-knowing, all-doing, Lord of all, stainless and
secondless,

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

Self-illumined, beginningless and endless, beyond the Beyond, without
attributes, Being and Knowing and Bliss. That which is considered the
individual is from a part of Him.

8-10 These, like sparks of a fire, with beginningless ignorance,
separated and encased in bodies by beginningless karma,

Are fettered by forms of good and evil, giving happiness and
misery,--with nationality of body, length of life, and fortune born of
karma.

In every life obtained. They have also, O Bird, a higher and more subtle
body, the *liṅga*, lasting until liberation.

11-13. The unmoving things, worms, goats, birds, animals, men, the
righteous, the thirty-three deities, and also the liberated, according
to their order,

Having worn and cast aside the four sorts of bodies thousands of times,
one becomes a man by good deeds, and if he becomes a knower <span
id="fr_188"></span>[1](#fn_185.md) he attains liberation.

The embodied, in the eighty-four hundred thousands of bodies before
attaining human birth, can obtain no knowledge of the truth.

14-16. Through millions of myriads of thousands of births some time a
being obtains human birth, through the accumulation of merit.

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

He who, having obtained a human body, difficult to get, and a step to
liberation, does not help himself over,--who in this world is more
sinful than he?

The man who, having obtained this highest birth and superior senses,
does not understand what benefits the soul is a slayer of Brāhmaṇ.

17-19. Without a body, nobody obtains the object of human life;
therefore should he guard his body as wealth and perform meritorious
deeds.

He should always guard his body, which is the means to everything.
Living, he should make every effort to protect it, in view of welfare.

A village again, a field again, wealth again, a house again, good and
evil actions again--the body never again. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_186.md)

20-21. The wise always adopt means for the preservation of the body;
even those afflicted with diseases such as leprosy do not wish to give
it up.

It should be guarded for the sake of duty; duty for the sake of
knowledge; knowledge for the sake of Yoga-meditation,--then he is soon
released.

22-23. If he does not guard himself against harm who else will?
Therefore should he look after his own benefit.

He who does not take precautions against the diseases of hell while
here; afflicted with disease and having gone to a country where there is
no medicine, what will he do?

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

24-25. Old age comes on like a tigress; life goes like water from a
broken pot; diseases attack like foes. Therefore should he strive for
the best.

So long as misery does not come, so long as calamity does not befall, so
long as the senses are not decayed, so long should he strive for the
best.

26-32. So long as the body lasts, so long should truth be pursued,--the
stupid man digs his well when the corner of his house is already afire.

The time of death is not known by those who are variously embodied in
the world of change. Alas! a man, between happiness and misery, does not
know his own benefit.

Though seeing those just born, the afflicted, the dead, those whom
calamity has befallen, and the miserable, people are never afraid,
having drunk the liquor of delusion.

Riches are like unto a dream; youth is like a flower, life is fickle as
lightning,--where is there a discerning one who is at ease?

Even a hundred years of life is very little, and half of it is sleep and
idleness, and even that little is unfruitful owing to the miseries of
childhood, disease and old age.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

He does not do what ought to be done; when he should be awake he sleeps;
where he should fear he confides. Alas! what man is not stricken.

How shall the individual who has taken a body, which is like foam on
water and is attached to passing objects, be free from fear?

33-35. He who does not know what is good for him thinks the harmful
beneficial, the impermanent permanent, and the evil good;

Though seeing, he falters; though hearing, he does not understand;
though reading, he does not know; bewildered by the divine magic.

This universe is immersed in the boundless ocean of death,--though
grasped by the crocodiles of death, disease and old age, he does not
understand.

36-38. Time, though wearing away with every moment, is unnoticed, just
as an unbaked pot placed in water disappears imperceptibly.

Air may be enclosed, ether may be split; waves may be bound,--life
cannot be made permanent.

Earth is burnt away by time; even Meru is reduced to powder; the water
of the ocean is dried away--what shall be said of the body?

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

39-41. The wolf of death forcibly slays the lamb of a mortal, who prates
of "my offspring; my wife; my wealth; my relatives."

"This has been done; this is to be done; this other is done or not
done." Him who is thus prating death overpowers.

"It must be done to-morrow; it must be done to-day; in the morning or in
the afternoon,"--death does not consider whether it leas been done or
not done.

42\. Thou shalt encounter the enemy, death, whose, coming is shown by
age, who has an army of dreadful diseases--wilt thou not see the
saviour?

43-44. Death preys upon the man [afflicted](errata.htm#23.md) with the
needles of thirst, bitten by the serpent of sense-objects, and baked in
the fire of desire and repulsion.

Death attacks children, young men, the old, those in the embryo
condition,--such is this world of creatures.

45-48. This individual, leaving his own body, goes to the abode of Yama.
What is the good of association with wife, mother, father, son and
others?

The world of change is verily the root of misery. He who is in it is
afflicted with misery. He who abandons it becomes happy,--otherwise
never.

This world of change, which is the source of all misery, the seat of all
calamities, and the refuge of all sins, should be abandoned at once.

A man bound in fetters of iron or wood may be released, but from the
fetters of son and wife can never be freed.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

49-51. So long as the being makes attachments pleasant to the mind, so
long shall the dagger of sorrow pierce his heart.

People are destroyed every day by the desire for great wealth. Alas! Fie
upon the foods of the senses, which steal away the senses of the body.

Just as the fish, covetous of flesh, does not see the iron hook, so the
embodied, covetous of pleasure, does not see the torments of Yama.

52-55. Those men who do not understand what is good and what is not good
for them, who constantly pursue evil courses, and are intent on the
filling of the belly, are destined for hell, O Bird.

Sleep, sexual pleasure, and eating are common to all creatures. Who
possesses knowledge is called a man, who is devoid of it is called a
beast.

Foolish men are tormented at break of day by nature's calls; when the
sun is in the meridian by hunger and thirst; in the night by passion and
sleep.

All those beings who are attached to their bodies, wealth, wife and
other things, are born and die deluded by ignorance, alas!

56-57. Therefore should attachment be shunned always, It is not possible
to give up everything. therefore should friendship with the great be
cultivated, as a remedy for attachment.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

Attachment to the good, discrimination, and purity of the eyes--the man
who has not these is blind. How shall he not tread evil ways?

58\. All those deluded men who turn away from the duties of their
respective castes and orders, and do not understand the highest
righteousness, perish fruitlessly.

59-60. Some are intent upon ceremonies, attached to the practice of
vows; with self enveloped in ignorance the imposters go about.

The men who are attached to the ceremonial alone are satisfied with mere
names, deluded by the repetitions of mantras, oblations and other
things, and by elaborate rituals.

61-62. The fools, bewildered by My magic, desire to obtain the invisible
by single meals, fasts and other restraints, and by the emaciation of
the body.

Of those who have no discrimination, what liberation can there be by
bodily tortures alone? What great serpent is killed by beating the
anthill alone? <span id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_187.md)

63\. The hypocrites, putting on appearances, and wearing quantities of
matted hair, and using antelope skins, wander about like knowers, and
even delude people.

64\. He who is attached to the pleasures of the worlds of change, saying
"I am a knower of Brāhmaṇ," and is devoid of both rites and Brāhmaṇ
should be shunned like a low outcaste.

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

65-69. Donkeys walk about among people, in forests and among houses,
quite naked and unashamed. Are these free from attachment?

If men are to be liberated by earth, ashes and dust, does the dog which
always live among earth and ashes become liberated?

The jackals, rats, deer and others, which feed upon grass, leaves and
water, and always live in forests,--do these become ascetics?

The crocodiles, fishes and others, which from birth to death, dwell in
the waters of Ganges,--do these become Yogins?

Pigeons at times eat stones, and Chātaka birds do not drink water from
the earth,--are these observers of vows?

70\. Therefore this class of practices is a thing which makes pleasure
for people, O Lord of Birds,--direct knowledge of the Truth is the cause
of liberation.

71-73. Fallen into the great well of the six philosophies, <span
id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_188.md) O Bird, the brutes do not understand the
chief good; bound in the snare of animalism.

They are tossed hither and thither in the dreadful ocean of Vedas and
Śāstras; caught in the six waves they remain sophists.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

He who knows the Vedas, the Śāstras and the Purāṇas, but does not know
the chief good,--of that imitator all this is as the speech of a crow.

71-76. "This is known; this must be known,"--thus bewildered by anxiety
they read the scriptures day and night, turning away from the highest
truth.

The fools, decorated with garlands of poetry constructed of forms of
speech, miserable with anxiety, remain with senses bewildered.

76-77. Men trouble themselves variously, but the highest truth is
otherwise; they explain in different ways but the best purport of the
Śāstras is otherwise.

They talk of the highest experiences, not realising them themselves.
Some have ceased preaching, being engrossed in egotism.

78-82. They repeat the Vedas and the Śāstras, and argue with one
[another](errata.htm#24.md), but they do not understand the highest
truth,--like the spoon the flavour of the food.

The head bears flowers, the nostril knows the smell. They read the Vedas
and the Śāstras, but find impossible the understanding of the truth.

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

The fool, not knowing that the truth is seated in himself, is bewildered
by the Śāstras,--a foolish goatherd, with the young goat under his arm,
peers into the well.

Verbal knowledge cannot destroy the illusions of the world of
change,--darkness never disappears by talking of a lamp.

Reading, to a man devoid of wisdom, is like a mirror to the blind;
hence, for those who have understanding, Śāstras are only a potter to
the knowledge of the truth.

83-84. "'This is known; this must be known,"--he wishes to hear
everything. If one lives for a thousand celestial years he cannot reach
the end of the Śāstras.

The Śāstras are numerous; life is brief; and there are tens of millions
of obstacles; therefore the essence should be understood,--like the swan
taking the milk in the water.

85-86. Haring practised the Vedas and the Śāstras, and having known the
Truth, the wise man should abandon all the scriptures; just as one rich
in grains abandons the straw.

Just as there is no use for food to one who is satisfied with nectar, so
is there not use for the scriptures, O Tārkṣya, to the knower of the
Truth.

87-88. There is no liberation by the study of the Vedas, nor by the
reading of the Śāstras. Emancipation is by knowledge alone, not
otherwise, O son of Vinatā.

The stages of life are not the cause of liberation, nor are the
philosophies, nor are actions,---knowledge only is the cause.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

89-90. The word from the Teacher gives liberation; all learning is
masquerade. Among thousands of woods the Sañjīvana <span
id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_189.md) is best.

The non-dual, verily declared auspicious, is beyond efforts of action,
and to be obtained by the word of the Teacher, not by the study of tens
of millions of texts.

91\. Knowledge is said to be of two kinds: study and discrimination. The
study is of Śabda Brāhmaṇ; Para Brahmaṇ is reached by discrimination.

92\. Some prefer the Non-dual <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_190.md);
other prefer the Dual <span id="fr_194"></span>[3](#fn_191.md) but they do
not understand the One Reality, beyond the Dual and Non-dual.

93-94. Two phrases make for bondage and liberation: "Mine" and
"Not-mine." The being saying "Mine" is bound; saying "Not-mine" is
released.

That is the karma that does not bind, that the knowledge that gives
release; other karma is worrying, other knowledge is skilful chiselling.

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

95-97. So long as actions are performed; so long as the impressions of
the world of change remain, so long as the senses are fickle; so long
how can there be realisation of Truth?

So long as there is pride of body; so long as there is the sense of
"mineness," so long as there is excited striving; so long as there is
imagination of plans;

So long as there is not stability of mind; so long as there is no
meditation upon the Śāstras, so long as there is no love for the
Teacher; so long how can there be realisation of Truth?

98-99. So long as one does not reach Truth, so long should he do
austerities, vows, pilgrimage to sacred waters, recitations, oblations,
worship and reading of the prescribed texts of the Vedas and Śāstras.

Therefore, if one desires liberation for himself, O Tārkṣya, he should
every effort, always, and under all circumstances he attached to Truth.

100\. One who is tormented by the three miseries and the rest, should
resort to the shade of the tree of Liberation, whose flowers are
righteousness and knowledge, and fruits are heaven and liberation.

101\. Therefore from the mouth of the Blessed Teacher the Truth of the
self should be known. By knowledge the being is easily released from the
awful bondage of the worlds of change.

102\. Listen! I will tell you now about the final actions of the knower
of the Truth, by which he obtains liberation, which is called the
Nirvāṇa of Brāhmaṇ.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

103-107. His last days approaching, the man, rid of fear, should cut
off, with the sword of unattachment, the desires connected with the
body.

Courageously wandering from home, performing ablutions in the water of
the holy bathing places, sitting alone on a pure seat prepared as
prescribed,

He should practise mentally upon the supreme three-fold pure Word of
Brahmā. He should, with breath controlled, restrain his mind, not
forgetting the Brahma Bīja. <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_192.md)

With reason for charioteer he should withdraw the senses from the
sense-objects by the mind, and should fix his mind, drawn away by
karmas, with understanding, upon the pure.

"1 am Brāhmaṇ, the Supreme Abode; I am Brāhmaṇ, the Highest
Goal,"--having realised this and placed the self in the self he should
meditate.

108\. He who, when leaving the body, utters the one-syllabled Brāhmaṇ,
"Oṁ," remembering me, goes to the Highest Goal.

109-110. The hypocrites, devoid of knowledge and unattachment, do not go
there. I will tell you about the wise, who go to that goal.

Free from pride and delusion, with the evils of attachment conquered,
always dwelling in the Higher Self, with desires overcome, released from
the contracts known as pleasure and pain, they go, undeluded, on that
eternal path.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

111-114. He who bathes in the water of the Mānasa, <span
id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) which removes the impurities of
attraction and repulsion, in the lake of knowledge, in the waters of
Truth,--he verily attains liberation.

He who, firm in non-attachment, worships me, thinking of no other,
full-visioned, with tranquil self,--he verily attains liberation.

He who, expecting to die, leaning his home, dwells at a sacred
bathing-place, or dies in a place of liberation, he verily attains
liberation.

Ayodhyā,  <span id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_194.md) Mathurā, <span
id="fr_198"></span>[3](#fn_195.md) Gayā, <span
id="fr_199"></span>[4](#fn_196.md) Kaśī, <span
id="fr_200"></span>[5](#fn_197.md) Kañchi, <span
id="fr_201"></span>[6](#fn_198.md) Avantikā, <span
id="fr_202"></span>[7](#fn_199.md) Dwārāvatī, <span
id="fr_203"></span>[8](#fn_200.md)--these seven cities should be known as
the givers of liberation.

115\. This eternal way of liberal in al has been described to you, O
Tārkṣya,--hearing it with knowledge and dispassion one attains
liberation.

116\. Knowers of Truth attain liberation; righteous men go to heaven;
sinners go to an evil condition; birds and others transmigrate.

117\. Thus in sixteen chapters I have related to you the extracted
essence of all the scriptures. What else do you wish to hear?

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

118-120. Sūta said: Having thus heard, O King, these words from the
mouth of the Lord, Garuḍa, repeatedly prostrating himself, said this,
with hands folded together:--

"O Lord, O God of Gods, having heard these words of nectar I have been
helped over the ocean of existence, O Lord, O. Protector!

"I stand freed from doubts. My desires have been completely fulfilled."
Having said this, Garuḍa became silent and lost in meditation.

121\. May Hari, the remembrance of whom removes evil, who gives the
condition of happiness for the sacrifice of worship, and who gives
liberation for supreme devotion to Him,--protect us.
