### CHAPTER IX.

#### An Account of the Rites for the Dying.

1\. Garuḍa said: You have spoken fully about the gifts for the diseased.
Tell now, O Lord, of the rites for the dying.

2\. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O Tārkṣya, and I will explain the
rites for one leaving the body, and by what rites men after death reach
a good condition.

3-5. When, by the effects of karma, the embodied leaves his ordinary
body, then, near to a holy basil tree one should make a ring with
cowdung. <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_82.md)

Next, having scattered sesamum seeds, he should strew darbha-grass, and
then have the Śālagrāma stone placed on the cleaned platform.

Liberation is certain for the being who dies near the Śālagrāma stone,
which removes all ills and sins,

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

6-9 Where is the shade of the holy basil tree, which removes the pain of
being, there is always liberation for the dying, difficult to obtain by
gifts.

The house in which the holy basil tree is enshrined is like a holy
bathing place,--the servants of Yama do not come to it.

Yama is not able to see him who gives up his life while having a holy
basil shoot, though he have hundreds of sins.

The man who dies with a leaf of it in his mouth, upon a seat of sesamum
and darbha-grass, goes to the city of Viṣṇu, unfailingly, though he have
no son.

10-13. Sesamums, darbha-grasses and holy basil are three holy things,
and they prevent an ailing man from going to a miserable condition.

Because the sesamum is produced from My sweat it is holy; hence Asuras,
Dānavas and Daityas run away from sesamum.

The darbha grasses, my riches, O Tārkṣhya, are produced from my hairs;
hence by the mere touch of them men attain heaven.

Brahma is seated at the root of the kuśa-grass; in the middle of the
kuśa is Janārdana; <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) at the tip of the
kuśa is Śaṅkaradeva <span id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_84.md)--three shining
ones are seated in the kuśa grass.

14-15. Hence kuśa, fire, mantras, holy basil; Brāhmiṇs and cows do not
lose their purity by being used again and again.

Darbha-grass becomes unclean with rice-balls; Brāhmiṇs, by eating the
offerings for the departed; mantras, cows and holy basil, when basely
used; and fire, on a cremation-ground.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

16-20. One should lay the dying man on the ground cleaned with cow-dung
and spread over with darbha-grasses; not support him in the air. <span
id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_85.md)

Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Rudra <span id="fr_88"></span>[2](#fn_86.md) all the shining
ones, and Sacrificial Fire stand upon the ring,---therefore should one
make a ring.

The ground must he pure everywhere, with no stain to be seen. If there
is a stain it should be cleaned away by further plastering.

Demons, goblins, elementals, spooks, and the followers of Yama enter an
impure place, and a cot above the ground.

Hence without this ring one should not perform oblations to the fire,
Śrāddha, the feeding of Brāhmiṇs, the worship of the Holy Ones; nor
place the dying man upon the ground.

21-22. Next, placing him on the cleaned ground, one should put gold and
jewels upon his lips, and give him the Water of the Feet of Vishnu in
the form of the Śālagrāma.

He who drinks even a drop of the water of the water of the Śālagrāma
stone <span id="fr_89"></span>[3](#fn_87.md) is absolved from all sins, and
goes to the residence Vaikuṇṭḥa. <span id="fr_90"></span>[4](#fn_88.md)

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

23-30. Then one should give him the water of the Ganges, which is the
effacer of great sins, and gives fruit of merit equal to bathings and
gifts at all the sacred waters.

He who performs a thousand times the Chāndrāyaṇa fast which purifies his
body, and he who drinks the water of the Ganges, are both equal.

Just as, O Tārkṣya, a bundle of cotton is destroyed by falling into the
fire, so, by his drinking the water of the Ganges, is his sin reduced to
ashes.

He who drinks the water of the Ganges, heated by the rays of the
sun <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_89.md) is freed from all births and
goes to the abode of Hari.

By bathing in other rivers men are purified,--so also by merely
touching, drinking or calling upon the Ganges.

It sanctifies meritless men by hundreds and thousands. Therefore should
one drink of the Ganges, whose water helps one over the ocean of
transmigration.

He who calls, "O Ganges, Ganges" while life is flickering in the throat,
goes when dead to the city of Viṣṇu, and is not born again on earth.

And the man who, when his life is leaving, contemplates with faith the
Ganges, goes to the highest goal.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

31-33. Therefore he should contemplate, salute, keep in mind the Ganges,
and drink its water. Then he should listen, however little, to the
Bhāgavata, <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_90.md) which is a giver of
liberation.

He who in his last moments repeats a verse, or half or quarter of a
verse of the Bhāgavata never returns hither from the world of Brahmā.

The repeating of the Vedas and the Upaniṣads; the hymning of Viṣṇu and
Śiva--these bring liberation at death to Brāhmiṇs, Kṣattriyas and
Vaiṣyas.

34-35. At the time when the breath is leaving the body, he should make a
fast, O Bird. Dissatisfied with worldly things the twice-born should
take up relinquishment. <span id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_91.md)

He who says, <span id="fr_94"></span>[3](#fn_92.md) while life is still
flickering in his throat, "I have relinquished," goes at death to the
city of Viṣṇu, and is not born again on earth.

36-39. Then, of him who is righteous and has thus performed the rites, O
Bird, the life breaths easily pass out through the higher opening. The
mouth, eyes, nostrils and ears are the seven gateways through which go
those of good deeds. Yogins go through an opening in the head.

When the rising and descending life-breaths, which are joined, become
separate, then, becoming subtle, the life-breath departs from the inert
body.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

When the Lord of Breath departs, the body falls like a tree unsupported
and stricken by time.

40-41. The motionless body, left by the vital breath, becomes detestable
and unfit to touch; foul smells soon arise in it, and it is disliked by
everybody.

How can men, who perish in a moment, be proud of the body, with its
three conditions,--worm, dung and ashes?

42-43. Earth is dissipated to earth; likewise water to water; fire is
dissipated in fire; also air in air.

And, similarly, ether to ether: and the Self that is in the bodies is
happy, all-pervading, eternally free, witness of the world, birthless
and deathless.

44-45. The individual, possessing all the senses, surrounded with
sense-objects of sound and the rest, clinging to desire and love,
environed by the sheath of karma,

Endowed with good tendencies, enters a new body created by his own
karma, as does a householder whose house has been burnt.

46-47: Then the messengers of the Shining Ones, resplendent with
flashing plumes, arrive, bringing a chariot wreathed with countless
bells,

And they, knowing the true righteousness, wise, always beloved by the
righteous, carry him, who has performed the rites, away in their own
chariot.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

48\. That great man, in a resplendent body, with shining garments and
garlands, possessed of gold and diamond ornaments, by virtue of gifts
attains heaven, and is honoured by the Holy Ones.
