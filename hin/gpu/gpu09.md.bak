### CHAPTER VII.

#### Babhruvāhana's Sacrament for the Departed One.

1\. Sūta said: Having heard this, Garuḍa, trembling like a leaf of the
holy fig-tree, again questioned Keśava for the benefit of men.

2\. Garuḍa said: Tell me by what means men who have committed sins
unknowingly or knowingly escape from the torments of the servants of
Yama.

3-4. For those men who are immersed in the ocean of transmigration, of
weak intelligence, their reason clouded by sin, their self dimmed by
attachment to sense-objects--

For their uplifting tell me, O Lord, the exact meaning of the Purāṇas;
and the means by which people attain a happy condition, O Mādhava.

5\. The Blessed Lord said: O Tārkṣya, you have done well in asking for
the benefit of men, Listen attentively, and I will tell you all.

6\. Hard indeed, as already said, is the fate of the sinful and those
without sons; but never so, O Lord of Birds, that of those who have sons
and who are righteous,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

7\. If by any past action of his the birth of a son has been prevented,
then some means should be taken for obtaining a son.

8\. Having listened to the Harivanśa, or performed the Śatachaṇḍī, or
worshipped the Blessed Śiva with devotion, the intelligent should beget
a son.

9\. The son saves his father from the hell called Put; therefore he was
named "putra" by the Self-existent himself.

10\. Even a single son, if righteous, carries the whole family over. 'By
the son he conquers the worlds,' is the ancient saying.

11\. The Vedas also proclaim the great importance of the son.
Accordingly, having seen the face of a son, one is released from the
debt to the forefathers.

12\. By the touch of his grandson a mortal is released from the
three-fold debt. With the help of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons
he goes from the worlds and obtains heaven.

13\. The son of a Brāhma marriage uplifts, but the illegitimate drags
down. Knowing this, O Best of Birds, one should avoid a woman of lower
caste.

14\. Sons having father and mother of the same caste are legitimate, O
Bird. They alone, by making Śrāddha-gifts are the means of their
fathers' attaining heaven.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

15\. Need I say one attains heaven by means of the Śrāddha performed by
a son, when a Departed One went to heaven even when it was offered by
another. Now listen.

16\. Concerning this I will give you, from ancient history, an example
of the efficacy of gifts for the higher body.

17-19. Formerly, in the Treta age, Tārkṣya, there reigned over the
delightful city of Mahodaya a king named Babhruvāhana, who was very
powerful, and firm in righteousness,

A sacrificer, Lord of Gifts, prosperous, a lover of Brāhmaṇs, valuing
the good, endowed with good character and of good conduct,
compassionate, skilled,

Righteously protecting his subjects as though they were his own sons,
always delighting in Kṣattriya duties, and punishing the guilty.

20-21. Once, that powerful king, with his army, went hunting. He entered
a thick forest, full of various kinds of trees,

Crowded with various species of animals, and resounding with the cries
of various birds. In the midst of the forest the king saw a deer in the
distance.

22\. The deer, severely wounded by his very hard arrow, ran out of sight
into the interior of the forest, carrying the arrow with him.

23\. The king, following the blood-stains on the grass, pursued the deer
and came into another forest.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

24\. That leader of men, hungry and with parched throat, fainting with
the heat and with fatigue, coming to a lake bathed in it with his horse.

25-27. Then, having drunk of that cool water, rendered fragrant by
the-pollen of the lotus, Babhruvāhana came out of the water refreshed,

And saw a delightful fig-tree, giving cool shade with its large
spreading boughs, sounding with many birds,

And standing like a big standard over the whole forest. The king
approached and sat at its root.

28\. Now he beheld a Departed One, of terrible appearance, humpbacked
and fleshless, with hair erect, dirty, and with senses discomposed by
hunger and thirst.

29-31. Seeing him deformed and dreadful Babhruvāhana wondered. The
Departed One, also seeing the king who had come to that dreadful forest,

And becoming filled with curiosity, came near to him. Then, O Tārkṣya,
this king of the Departed spoke thus to the king:

"I have escaped the condition of the Departed and reached the highest
condition, by being in touch with you, O Great-Armed one,--I am highly
blessed."

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

32-33. The king said: "O Black-complexioned and Gaping-mouthed, by what
bad deeds did you reach this state of the Departed, dreadful to see, and
highly unhappy?"

"Tell me in detail the cause of your condition, dear. Who are you, and
by what gifts will your condition as Departed pass away?"

34-38. The Departed one said: "I will tell you everything from the
beginning, O Best of Kings. You will surely have compassion upon me when
you have heard the cause of my condition as Departed,

"There is a town named Vaidaśa, possessed of all prosperity, having many
districts, and abounding in precious stones of various kinds,

"Beautiful with palaces and mansions, and in which many religious acts
are performed. There, O Reverend Sir, I dwelt, always engaged in worship
of the Shining Ones.

"By caste I am a Vaishya, by name Sudeva, please know. By fire-offering
I pleased the Shining Ones, and likewise the forefathers by food.

"I gladdened the twice-born by offering various gifts. I gave food of
various kinds to the poor, the blind and the wretched.

39-41. "All this, O King, through my evil fate has proved fruitless. How
my good deeds proved fruitless I will relate to you.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

"I have no offspring, no companion, no relative and no friend like you,
who will perform for me the ceremonies for the-higher body.

"If the sixteen monthly Śrāddhas, O great king, are not performed, the
condition as Departed becomes firmly fixed, even if hundreds of annual
Śrāddhas are performed for him.

42-45. "Uplift me then, O Lord of Earth, by doing the ceremonies for my
higher body. It is said that in this world the king is the kinsman of
all castes.

"Therefore, O Lord of Kings, help me over, and I will give you a most
precious jewel, so that my departed condition may be destroyed, and my
higher state arise.

"In that manner please act, O warrior, if you desire my welfare.
Suffering from the misery of hunger and thirst, I cannot endure this
departed condition.

"In this forest there is sweet and cool water, and pleasant fruits, but
I am not able to grasp them at all, although afflicted with hunger and
thirst.

46-48. "If the great Nārāyaṇa rite is performed for me, O King, along
with all the ceremonies for the higher body, with Vaidic mantras,

"Then surely my condition as departed will unfailingly pass away. Vaidic
mantras, austerities, gifts, and compassion to all beings,

"Listening to holy scriptures, worship of Viṣṇu, association with the
good,--these, I have heard, are the destroyers of the departed
condition.

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

49-50. "So I will tell you about the worship of Viṣṇu, the destroyer of
the departed condition. Bring two pieces of gold, honestly gained, and
make one image of Nārāyaṇa from them, O King.

"Dress it with a pair of yellow cloths, put on it various ornaments,
bathe it in many waters,--and placing it, you should worship thus.

51-56. "Place Śrīdhara <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_59.md) to the east
of it, Madhusūdana <span id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_60.md) to the south, to
the west Vāmanadeva <span id="fr_62"></span>[3](#fn_61.md), to the north
Gadādhara, <span id="fr_63"></span>[4](#fn_62.md)

"In the middle Pitāmaha <span id="fr_64"></span>[5](#fn_63.md) and also
Maheśwara. <span id="fr_65"></span>[5](#fn_63.md) Worship these in turn
with sandal-paste and flowers, according to the rite.

"Then, having gone round them, make offerings in the fire to these
deities. Make offerings to the universal deities with clarified butter,
curds and milk.

"Next, having bathed, calm and controlled in mind, the sacrificer should
perform, according to the rite, in front of Nārāyaṇa, the ceremony for
the upper body.

"He must commence, as prescribed in the scriptures, by giving up anger
and greed, and perform all the ceremonies and the release of a bull.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

"Then he must give thirteen sets of pots to Brāhmiṇs, and having made
the gift of a bed, consecrate a pot of water for the sake of the
departed."

57\. The king said, "How is the pot for the departed to be prepared, and
in accordance with what: rites must it be given? Tell me, on account of
my sympathy for all, about the pot which gives release to the departed."

58-63. The departed said: "Oh Great King, you have done well in asking
this. Please take notice and l will describe that good gift by which the
departed condition cannot exist.

"The gift which is named 'the pot for the departed,' is a destroyer of
all evil. In all the worlds it is difficult to obtain this dissipator of
evil conditions.

"Having prepared a pot of refined gold, consecrated it to Brahmā,
Īśa <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_64.md) and Keśava <span
id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_65.md), and all the guardians of the quarters,
filled it with clarified butter and worshipped before it with devotion,
give it to a twice-born. What good are a hundred other gifts from you?

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

"Brahmā in the middle, likewise Viṣṇu, and Śaṅkara, eternal giver of
happiness; in the east and other directions, in the neck of it, the
guardians of the universe, in order--

"These having duly worshipped, O King, with incenses, flowers and
sandal-paste, one should give away the golden pot, full of milk and
clarified butter.

"This gift, O King, which is superior to all other gifts in removing
great sins, should be made with faith, for the release of the departed."

64-65. The Blessed Lord spoke on: His army, while he was thus conversing
with the departed, followed him up, with elephants, horses and chariots,
O Kāśyapa.

On the arrival of the army the departed one, having given the great
jewel to the king, bowed to him, again implored him, and became
invisible.

66-68. Having come out of the forest, the king returned to his city, and
arrived there remembering all that was said by the departed one.

He duly performed; O Bird, the rites and ceremonies for the dweller in
the upper body, and the departed, released by these sacred gifts,
attained heaven.

By the Śrāddha, performed even by a stranger, the departed attain a
happy state,--what wonder then that when the son performs it the father
should reach it!

60\. He who hears, and he who causes others to hear this holy history,
never go to the departed condition, though they may. have acted
sinfully.
