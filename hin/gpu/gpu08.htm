<p>1. Garu&#7693;a said:--Tell me, O Ke&#347;ava, how he who returns from hells is formed in the womb of the mother, and what miseries he suffers in the embryonic condition.</p>  
<p>2. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u said: I will tell you how the mortal is born when the male and female elements are bound together by the union of man and woman.</p>  
<p>3. In the middle of the menstruation period, in the three days on which Indra incurs the sin of Br&#257;micide, the body of the sinful begins to form.</p>  
<p>4. The mother of one returning from hell is regarded on the first day as an outcaste woman, on the second as the murderer of a Br&#257;hmi&#7751;, and on the third as a washerwoman.</p>  
<p>5. The creature, in obtaining a body, according to karma, the divine eye, enters the womb of a woman, which is the receptacle of a man's seed.</p>  
<p>6. In one night it becomes a lump; by the fifth night round; by the tenth day like the fruit of the jujube tree,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and after that an egg of flesh.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></A></p>  
<p>7-8. By the first month the head, by the second the arms and other parts of the body are formed; by the third occurs the formation of nails, hair, bones, skin, linga and other cavities;</p>  
<p>By the fourth the seven bodily fluids; by the fifth hunger and thirst arise; by the sixth, enveloped by the chorion, it moves to the left of the womb.</p>  
<p>9. The bodily substances are formed of the foods and liquids of the mother, and the creature at the time of birth lies in the disgusting hollow of the loins, amid f&#339;ces and urine.</p>  
<p>10. All its limbs bitten constantly by hungry worms, it swoons away repeatedly through excessive pain, as they are very tender.</p>  
<p>11. Thus enveloped by the womb and bound outside by the sinews, it feels pain all over its body, caused by the mother's eating many things--pungent, bitter, hot, salt, sour and acid.</p>  
<p>12. With its head placed in its belly and its back and neck curved, it is unable to move its limbs,--like a parrot in a cage.</p>  
<p>13. There he remembers, by divine power, the Karma generated in hundreds of previous births,--and remembering, sobs for a long time, obtaining not the least happiness.</p>  
<p>14. Having this insight he, with hands put together, bound in seven bonds, imploring and trembling, adores in plaintive tones Him who placed him in the womb.</p>  
<p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></A></p>  
<p>15. From the beginning of the seventh month, though he gains consciousness, he who is in the womb trembles and moves about because of the parturition winds, like a uterine worm.</p>  
<p>16-23. The creature says, "I seek refuge in Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; the husband of &#346;r&#299;, the supporter of the universe, the destroyer of evil, who is compassionate to those who come for shelter.</p>  
<p>"I am bewildered by Thy magic, as regards body and son and wife; misled by my egoism I am transmigrating, O Lord.</p>  
<p>"I did good and evil actions for the sake of my dependents, and as s result I am tormented, while they who enjoy the fruits escape.</p>  
<p>"If I am released from this womb I will lay myself at Thy feet, and I will take the means by which I may obtain liberation.</p>  
<p>"Fallen into a well of f&#339;ces and urine, I am burnt by the fire of the belly, and anxious to escape from it. When shall I get out?</p>  
<p>"In Him alone, who has given me this experience, and is compassionate to the afflicted, will I seek refuge. Let not this transmigration occur to me again.</p>  
<p>"But no, I wish never to come out of the womb, where misery results from my sinful actions.</p>  
<p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></A></p>  
<p>"Because remaining even here in great misery, bearing the fatigue, resorting to Thy feet I will keep myself aloof from the worlds of change."</p>  
<p>24. The Blessed Lord said: He who has thus considered, and has been ten months in the womb, endowed with insight, while praying, suddenly is cast out head downwards into birth, by the winds of delivery.</p>  
<p>25. Cast out forcibly, bending down his head, he comes out with anxiety and painfully breathless and with memory destroyed.</p>  
<p>26. Having fallen on the ground he moves like a worm in excrement. He is become changed in condition, and cries loudly, deprived of knowledge.</p>  
<p>27. If the state of mind which arises in the womb, during illness, on the cremation ground, or upon hearing the Pur&#257;&#7751;as were permanent--who would not be liberated from bondage!</p>  
<p>28. When he comes out of the womb, after experiencing his karma, then verily the man is bewildered by the magic of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</p>  
<p>29. Then, when he is touched by that magic, powerless, he is unable to speak. He experiences the miseries of infancy and childhood arising from dependence.</p>  
<p>30. He is nourished by people who do not understand his wishes, unable to ward off what is thrust upon him against his desire.</p>  
<p>31. Lain upon a bed unclean and befouled by perspiration, he is unable to scratch his limbs, to sit, rise or move.</p>  
<p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></A></p>  
<p>32. Mosquitoes, gnats, bugs and other flies bite him, skinless and weeping and deprived of understanding, just as insects bite little worms.</p>  
<p>33. In this wise having experienced the miseries of infancy and of childhood, he reaches youth and acquires evil tendencies.</p>  
<p>34. Then he begins evil brooding, mingling in the company of the wicked; he hates the scriptures and good men, and becomes lustful.</p>  
<p>35. Seeing a seductive woman, his senses captivated by her blandishments, infatuated he falls into great darkness, like a moth into a flame.</p>  
<p>36. The deer, the elephant, the bird, the bee and the fish: these five are led to destruction by one of the senses; how then shall the infatuated one not be destroyed, when he enjoys the five kinds of objects by five senses.</p>  
<p>37. He longs for the unobtainable, and on account of ignorance becomes angry and sorry, and his pride and anger increase with the growth of his body.</p>  
<p>38. The lover makes quarrels with rivals, to his own ruin and is destroyed by those stronger than himself, as one elephant by another.</p>  
<p>39. Who is more sinful than the fool who, attached to sense-objects, spends in vain the human birth which was difficult to obtain.</p>  
<p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></A></p>  
<p>40: After hundreds of lives one obtains human birth on earth; and even more difficult to obtain is that as a twice-born: and who then only provides for and pampers the senses, through foolishness lets slip the nectar from his hand.</p>  
<p>41. Then, having arrived at old age, he is troubled with great diseases; and, death having come, he goes to a miserable hell, as before.</p>  
<p>42. Thus held fast in the ever-circling noose of karma, the sinful, bewildered by my magic, are never released.</p>  
<p>43. Thus I have related to you, O T&#257;rk&#7779;ya, how the sinful, deprived of the sacrifices for the dead, go in hell. What else do you wish to hear?</p>
