<p>1. The tree Madhus&#363;dana,--whose firm root is Law, whose trunk is the Vedas, whose abundant branches are the Pur&#257;&#7751;as, whose flowers are sacrifices, and whose fruit is liberation,--excels.</p>  
<p>2. In Naimi&#7779;a, the field of the sleepless Ones,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the sages, Saunaka and others, performed sacrifices for thousands of years to attain the Heaven-world.</p>  
<p>3-5. Those sages once, in the morning,. having offered oblations to the sacrificial fire respectfully asked this of the revered S&#363;ta sitting there:--</p>  
<p>The sages said: The happiness-giving path of the Shining Ones</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="green">p. 2</font></A></p>  
<p>has been described by you. We now wish to hear about the fear-inspiring Way of Yama;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Also of the miseries of the World of Change,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and the means of destroying its pains. Please tell us correctly about the afflictions of this world and the other.</p>  
<p>6. Suta said: Listen then. I am willing to describe the way of Yama, very difficult to tread, happiness-giving, to the virtuously inclined, misery-giving to the sinful.</p>  
<p>7. As it was declared to Vainateya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> by the Blessed Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, when asked; just so will I relate it, to remove your difficulties.</p>  
<p>8-9. Once, when the Blessed Hari, the Teacher, was sitting at ease in Vaiku&#7751;&#7789;&#7717;a, the son of Vinat&#257;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> having bowed reverently, inquired:--</p>  
<p>Garu&#7693;a said: The Path of Devotion, of many forms, has been described to me by you, and also, O Shining One, has been told the highest goal of the devotees.</p>  
<p>10. Now I wish to hear about the fearsome Way of Yama, along which is the travelling, it is revealed, of those who turn away from devotion to Thee.</p>  
<p>11. The name of the Lord is easily pronounced, and the tongue is under control. Fie, fie upon the wretched men who nevertheless go to hell!</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="green">p. 3</font></A></p>  
<p>12. Tell me, then, O Lord, to what condition the sinful come, and in what way they obtain the miseries of the Way of Yama.</p>  
<p>13. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O Lord of Birds, and I will describe the Way of Yama, terrible even to hear about, by which those who are sinful go in hell.</p>  
<p>14-16. O T&#257;rk&#7779;ya, those who delight in sin, destitute of compassion and righteousness, attached to the wicked, averse from the true scriptures and the company of the good,</p>  
<p>Self-satisfied, unbending, intoxicated with the pride of wealth, having the ungodly qualities, lacking the divine attributes,</p>  
<p>Bewildered by many thoughts, enveloped in the net of delusion, revelling in the enjoyments of the desire-nature,--fall into a foul hell.</p>  
<p>17. Those men who are intent upon wisdom go to the highest goal; the sinfully-inclined go miserably to the torments of Yama.</p>  
<p>18. Listen how the misery of this world accrues to the sinful, then how they, having passed through death, meet with torments.</p>  
<p>19. Having experienced the good or the bad actions, in accordance with his former earning,--then, as the result of his&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> actions, some disease arises.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></A></p>  
<p>20. Powerful death, unexpectedly, like a serpent, approaches him stricken with bodily and mental pain, yet anxiously hoping to live.</p>  
<p>21-24. Not yet tired of life, being cared for by his dependents, with his body deformed through old age, nearing death, in the house,</p>  
<p>He remains, like a house-dog, eating what is ungraciously placed before him, diseased, with failing digestion, eating little, moving little,</p>  
<p>With eyes turned up through loss of vitality, with tubes obstructed by phlegm, exhausted by coughing and difficult breathing, with the death rattle in his throat,</p>  
<p>Lying encircled by his sorrowing relatives; though being spoken to he does not answer, being caught in the noose of death.</p>  
<p>25. In this condition, with mind busy with the support of his family, with senses unconquered, swooning with intense pain he dies amidst his weeping relatives.</p>  
<p>26. In this last moment, O T&#257;rk&#7779;ya, a divine vision arises,--all the worlds appear as one,--and he does not attempt to say anything.</p>  
<p>27. Then, at the destruction of the decayed senses and the numbing of the intelligence, the messengers of Yama come near and life departs.</p>  
<p>28. When the breath is leaving its place, the moment of dying</p>  
<p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A></p>  
<p>seems an age, and pain like the stinging of hundred scorpions is experienced.</p>  
<p>29. Now he emits foam; his mouth becomes filled with saliva. The vital breaths of the sinful depart by the lower gateway.</p>  
<p>30-31. Then, two terrifying messengers of Yama are come, of fierce aspect, bearing nooses and rods, naked, with grinding teeth,</p>  
<p>As black as crows, with hair erect, with ugly faces, with nails like weapons; seeing whom his heart palpitates and he releases excrements.</p>  
<p>32. The man of the size of a thumb, crying out 'oh, oh,' is dragged from the body by the servants of Yama, looking the while at his own body.</p>  
<p>33. Having put round him a body of torment, and bound the noose about his neck, they forcibly lead him a long way, like the king's officers a convict.</p>  
<p>34-35. While thus leading him the messengers menace him, and recount over and over again the awful terrors of the hells,--</p>  
<p>'Hurry up, you wicked man. You shall go to the abode of Yama. We will lead you now, without delay, to Kumbh&#299;p&#257;ka and the other hells.'</p>  
<p>36. Then hearing these words, and the weeping of his relatives; crying loudly 'Oh, oh,' he is beaten by the servants of Yama.</p>  
<p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A></p>  
<p>37-38. With failing heart and shuddering at their threats, bitten by clogs upon the way, afflicted, remembering his misdeeds,</p>  
<p>Hungry and thirsty, roasting in the sun, forest-fires and hot winds, struck upon the back with whips, painfully he walks, almost powerless, along a road of burning sand, shelterless and waterless.</p>  
<p>30-40. Here and there falling exhausted and insensible, and rising again,--in this way, very miserably led through the darkness to the abode of Yama,</p>  
<p>The man is brought there in a short time and the messengers show him the terrible torments of hell.</p>  
<p>41. Having seen the fearful Yama, the man, after a time, by command of Yama, swiftly comes back through the air, with the messengers.</p>  
<p>42. Having returned, bound by his past tendencies, desiring the body but held back with a noose by the followers of Yama, tortured by hunger and thirst, he weeps.</p>  
<p>43. He obtains the rice-balls given by his offspring, and the gifts made during the time of his illness. Nevertheless, O T&#257;rk&#7779;ya, the sinful Denier does not obtain gratification.</p>  
<p>44. The &#346;r&#257;ddha,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the gifts, and the handsful of water, for the sinful, do not uplift. Although they eat the rice-ball offering, still they are tortured with hunger.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A></p>  
<p>45. Those who are in the departed condition, deprived of the rice-ball offering, wander about in great misery, in an uninhabited forest, until the end of the age.</p>  
<p>46. Karma not experienced does not die away even in thousands of millions of ages; the being who has not experienced the torment certainly does not obtain the human form.</p>  
<p>47. Hence, O Twice-born,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for ten days the son should offer rice-balls. Every day these are divided into four portions, O Best of Birds.</p>  
<p>48. Two portions give nourishment to the five elements of the body; the third goes to the messengers of Yama; he lives upon the fourth.</p>  
<p>40. For nine days and nights the departed obtains rice-balls, and on the tenth day the being, with fully formed body, acquires strength.</p>  
<p>50. The old body being cremated, a new one is formed by these offerings, O Bird; the man, the size of a hand (cubit), by this experiences good and evil on the way.</p>  
<p>51-53. By the rice-ball of the first day the head is-formed; the neck and shoulders by the second; by the third the heart forms:</p>  
<p>By the fourth the back forms; and by the fifth the navel; by the sixth the hips and secret parts; by the seventh the thigh forms;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></A></p>  
<p>Likewise next the knees and feet by two; on the tenth day hunger and thirst.</p>  
<p>54. Dwelling in the body formed by the rice-balls, very hungry and pained with thirst, on both the eleventh and twelfth days the departed eats.</p>  
<p>55. On the thirteenth day the departed, bound by the servants of Yama, walks alone along the road like a captured monkey.</p>  
<p>56. The extent of the way of Yama measures eighty-six thousand Yojanas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> without Vaitara&#7751;&#299;, O Bird.</p>  
<p>57. Two hundred and forty-seven Yojanas each day the departed travels, going by day and night.</p>  
<p>58-59. Having passed successively. through these sixteen cities on the way, the sinful man goes to the place of the King of Righteousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:--</p>
