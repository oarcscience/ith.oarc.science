# GARUDA PURANA.

###### HOMAGE TO THE BLESSED GANEṢA.

### CHAPTER I.

#### An Account of the Miseries of the Sinful in this World and the Other.

1\. The tree Madhusūdana,--whose firm root is Law, whose trunk is the
Vedas, whose abundant branches are the Purāṇas, whose flowers are
sacrifices, and whose fruit is liberation,--excels.

2\. In Naimiṣa, the field of the sleepless Ones, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) the sages, Saunaka and others, performed
sacrifices for thousands of years to attain the Heaven-world.

3-5. Those sages once, in the morning,. having offered oblations to the
sacrificial fire respectfully asked this of the revered Sūta sitting
there:--

The sages said: The happiness-giving path of the Shining Ones

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

has been described by you. We now wish to hear about the fear-inspiring
Way of Yama; <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)

Also of the miseries of the World of Change, <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) and the means of destroying its pains.
Please tell us correctly about the afflictions of this world and the
other.

6\. Suta said: Listen then. I am willing to describe the way of Yama,
very difficult to tread, happiness-giving, to the virtuously inclined,
misery-giving to the sinful.

7\. As it was declared to Vainateya <span id="fr_5"></span>[3](#fn_5.md) by
the Blessed Viṣṇu, when asked; just so will I relate it, to remove your
difficulties.

8-9. Once, when the Blessed Hari, the Teacher, was sitting at ease in
Vaikuṇṭḥa, the son of Vinatā, <span id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_5.md) having
bowed reverently, inquired:--

Garuḍa said: The Path of Devotion, of many forms, has been described to
me by you, and also, O Shining One, has been told the highest goal of
the devotees.

10\. Now I wish to hear about the fearsome Way of Yama, along which is
the travelling, it is revealed, of those who turn away from devotion to
Thee.

11\. The name of the Lord is easily pronounced, and the tongue is under
control. Fie, fie upon the wretched men who nevertheless go to hell!

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

12\. Tell me, then, O Lord, to what condition the sinful come, and in
what way they obtain the miseries of the Way of Yama.

13\. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O Lord of Birds, and I will describe
the Way of Yama, terrible even to hear about, by which those who are
sinful go in hell.

14-16. O Tārkṣya, those who delight in sin, destitute of compassion and
righteousness, attached to the wicked, averse from the true scriptures
and the company of the good,

Self-satisfied, unbending, intoxicated with the pride of wealth, having
the ungodly qualities, lacking the divine attributes,

Bewildered by many thoughts, enveloped in the net of delusion, revelling
in the enjoyments of the desire-nature,--fall into a foul hell.

17\. Those men who are intent upon wisdom go to the highest goal; the
sinfully-inclined go miserably to the torments of Yama.

18\. Listen how the misery of this world accrues to the sinful, then how
they, having passed through death, meet with torments.

19\. Having experienced the good or the bad actions, in accordance with
his former earning,--then, as the result of his <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) actions, some disease arises.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

20\. Powerful death, unexpectedly, like a serpent, approaches him
stricken with bodily and mental pain, yet anxiously hoping to live.

21-24. Not yet tired of life, being cared for by his dependents, with
his body deformed through old age, nearing death, in the house,

He remains, like a house-dog, eating what is ungraciously placed before
him, diseased, with failing digestion, eating little, moving little,

With eyes turned up through loss of vitality, with tubes obstructed by
phlegm, exhausted by coughing and difficult breathing, with the death
rattle in his throat,

Lying encircled by his sorrowing relatives; though being spoken to he
does not answer, being caught in the noose of death.

25\. In this condition, with mind busy with the support of his family,
with senses unconquered, swooning with intense pain he dies amidst his
weeping relatives.

26\. In this last moment, O Tārkṣya, a divine vision arises,--all the
worlds appear as one,--and he does not attempt to say anything.

27\. Then, at the destruction of the decayed senses and the numbing of
the intelligence, the messengers of Yama come near and life departs.

28\. When the breath is leaving its place, the moment of dying

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

seems an age, and pain like the stinging of hundred scorpions is
experienced.

29\. Now he emits foam; his mouth becomes filled with saliva. The vital
breaths of the sinful depart by the lower gateway.

30-31. Then, two terrifying messengers of Yama are come, of fierce
aspect, bearing nooses and rods, naked, with grinding teeth,

As black as crows, with hair erect, with ugly faces, with nails like
weapons; seeing whom his heart palpitates and he releases excrements.

32\. The man of the size of a thumb, crying out 'oh, oh,' is dragged
from the body by the servants of Yama, looking the while at his own
body.

33\. Having put round him a body of torment, and bound the noose about
his neck, they forcibly lead him a long way, like the king's officers a
convict.

34-35. While thus leading him the messengers menace him, and recount
over and over again the awful terrors of the hells,--

'Hurry up, you wicked man. You shall go to the abode of Yama. We will
lead you now, without delay, to Kumbhīpāka and the other hells.'

36\. Then hearing these words, and the weeping of his relatives; crying
loudly 'Oh, oh,' he is beaten by the servants of Yama.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

37-38. With failing heart and shuddering at their threats, bitten by
clogs upon the way, afflicted, remembering his misdeeds,

Hungry and thirsty, roasting in the sun, forest-fires and hot winds,
struck upon the back with whips, painfully he walks, almost powerless,
along a road of burning sand, shelterless and waterless.

30-40. Here and there falling exhausted and insensible, and rising
again,--in this way, very miserably led through the darkness to the
abode of Yama,

The man is brought there in a short time and the messengers show him the
terrible torments of hell.

41\. Having seen the fearful Yama, the man, after a time, by command of
Yama, swiftly comes back through the air, with the messengers.

42\. Having returned, bound by his past tendencies, desiring the body
but held back with a noose by the followers of Yama, tortured by hunger
and thirst, he weeps.

43\. He obtains the rice-balls given by his offspring, and the gifts
made during the time of his illness. Nevertheless, O Tārkṣya, the sinful
Denier does not obtain gratification.

44\. The Śrāddha, <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_7.md) the gifts, and the
handsful of water, for the sinful, do not uplift. Although they eat the
rice-ball offering, still they are tortured with hunger.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

45\. Those who are in the departed condition, deprived of the rice-ball
offering, wander about in great misery, in an uninhabited forest, until
the end of the age.

46\. Karma not experienced does not die away even in thousands of
millions of ages; the being who has not experienced the torment
certainly does not obtain the human form.

47\. Hence, O Twice-born, <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) for ten days
the son should offer rice-balls. Every day these are divided into four
portions, O Best of Birds.

48\. Two portions give nourishment to the five elements of the body; the
third goes to the messengers of Yama; he lives upon the fourth.

40\. For nine days and nights the departed obtains rice-balls, and on
the tenth day the being, with fully formed body, acquires strength.

50\. The old body being cremated, a new one is formed by these
offerings, O Bird; the man, the size of a hand (cubit), by this
experiences good and evil on the way.

51-53. By the rice-ball of the first day the head is-formed; the neck
and shoulders by the second; by the third the heart forms:

By the fourth the back forms; and by the fifth the navel; by the sixth
the hips and secret parts; by the seventh the thigh forms;

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

Likewise next the knees and feet by two; on the tenth day hunger and
thirst.

54\. Dwelling in the body formed by the rice-balls, very hungry and
pained with thirst, on both the eleventh and twelfth days the departed
eats.

55\. On the thirteenth day the departed, bound by the servants of Yama,
walks alone along the road like a captured monkey.

56\. The extent of the way of Yama measures eighty-six thousand
Yojanas, <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) without Vaitaraṇī, O Bird.

57\. Two hundred and forty-seven Yojanas each day the departed travels,
going by day and night.

58-59. Having passed successively. through these sixteen cities on the
way, the sinful man goes to the place of the King of Righteousness <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_10.md):--

Saumya, <span id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_11.md) Sauripura, <span
id="fr_13"></span>[4](#fn_12.md) Nāgendrabhavana, <span
id="fr_14"></span>[5](#fn_13.md) Gāndharva, <span
id="fr_15"></span>[6](#fn_14.md) Shailāgama, <span
id="fr_16"></span>[7](#fn_15.md) Krauncha, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[8](#fn_16.md) Krūrapura, <span
id="fr_18"></span>[9](#fn_17.md) Vichitrabhavana, <span
id="fr_19"></span>[10](#fn_18.md) Bahwāpada, <span
id="fr_20"></span>[11](#fn_19.md) Duḥkhada, <span
id="fr_21"></span>[12](#fn_20.md) Nānākrandapura, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[13](#fn_21.md) Sutaptabhawana, <span
id="fr_23"></span>[14](#fn_22.md) Raudra, <span
id="fr_24"></span>[15](#fn_23.md) Payovarshana, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[16](#fn_24.md) Shītādhya, <span
id="fr_26"></span>[17](#fn_25.md) Bahubhīti <span
id="fr_27"></span>[18](#fn_26.md):--before the city of Yama, the abode of
righteousness

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

60\. Held by the nooses of Yama, the sinful, crying out "Oh, oh," having
left his own house, goes on the way to the city of Yama.
