# SIXTH GOBLIN

The Girl who transposed the heads of her  
Husband and Brother.  
Which combination of head and body is her husband?

Then the king went back to the sissoo tree, put the goblin on his
shoulder as before, and started in silence toward the monk. And the
goblin said to him: "O King, you are wise and good, so I am pleased with
you. To amuse you, therefore, I will tell you another story with a
puzzle in it. Listen."

 

Long ago there was a king named Glory-banner in the world. His city was
named Beautiful. And in this city was a splendid temple to the goddess
Gauri. And to the right of the temple was a lake called Bath of Gauri.
And on a certain day in each year a great crowd of people came there on
a pilgrimage from all directions to bathe.

One day a laundryman named White came there from another village to
bathe. And the youth saw a maiden who had also come there to bathe. Her
name was Lovely, and her father's name was Clean-cloth. She robbed the
moon of its beauty and White of his heart. So he inquired about her name
and family and went home lovesick.

When he got there, he was ill and could not eat without her. And when
his mother asked him, he told her what was in his heart, but did not
change his habits. But she went and told her husband, whose name was
Spotless.

So Spotless went and saw how his son was acting, and said: "My son, why
should you be downcast? Your desire is not hard to obtain. For if I ask
Clean-cloth, he will surely give you his daughter. We are not inferior
to him in birth, wealth, or social position. I know him and he knows me.
So there is no difficulty about it." Thus Spotless comforted his son,
made him eat and take care of himself, went with him the next day to
Clean-cloth's house, and asked that the girl might be given to his son
White. And Clean-cloth graciously promised to give her to him.

Then when the time came, Clean-cloth gave White his charming daughter, a
wife worthy of him. And when he was married, White went happily to his
father's house with his sweet bride.

Now as he lived there happily, Lovely's brother came to visit. And when
they had all asked him about his health and his sister had greeted him
with a kiss, and after he had rested, he said: "My father sent me to
invite Lovely and White to a festival in our house." And all the
relatives said it was a good plan and entertained him that day with
appropriate things to drink and eat.

The next morning White set out for his father-in-law's house, together
with his brother-in-law and Lovely. And when he came to the city
Beautiful, he saw the great temple of Gauri. And he said to Lovely and
her brother: "We will see this goddess. I will go first and you two stay
here." So White went in to see the goddess. He entered the temple and
bowed before the goddess whose eighteen arms had killed the horrible
demons, whose lotus-feet were set upon a giant that she had crushed.

And when he had worshipped her, an idea suddenly came to him. "People
honour this goddess with all kinds of living sacrifices. Why should I
not win her favour by sacrificing myself?" And he fetched a sword from a
deserted inner room, cut off his own head, and let it fall on the floor.

Presently his brother-in-law entered the temple to see why he delayed so
long. And when he saw his brother-in-law with his head cut off, he went
mad with grief, and cut off his own head in the same way with the same
sword.

Then when he failed to come out, Lovely was alarmed and entered the
temple. And when she saw her husband and her brother in that condition,
she cried: "Alas! This is the end of me!" and fell weeping to the floor.
But presently she rose, lamenting for the pair so unexpectantly dead,
and thought: "What is my life good for now?"

Before killing herself, she prayed to the goddess: "O Goddess! One only
deity of happiness and character! Partaker of the life of Shiva! Refuge
of all women-folk! Destroyer of grief! Why have you killed my husband
and my brother at one fell swoop? It was not right, for I was always
devoted to you. Then be my refuge when I pray to you, and hear my one
pitiful prayer. I shall leave this wretched body of mine on this spot,
but in every future life of mine, O Goddess, may I have the same husband
and brother." Thus she prayed, praised, and worshipped the goddess, then
tied a rope to an ashoka tree which grew there.

But while she was arranging the rope about her neck, a voice from heaven
cried: "Do nothing rash, my daughter. Leave the rope alone. Though you
are young, I am pleased with your unusual goodness. Place the two heads
on the two bodies and they shall rise up again and live through my
favour."

So Lovely left the rope alone and joyfully went to the bodies. But in
her great hurry and confusion she made a mistake. She put her husband's
head on her brother's body and her brother's head on her husband's body.
Then they arose, sound and well, like men awaking from a dream. And they
were all delighted to hear one another's  adventures, worshipped the
goddess, and went on their way.

Now as she walked along, Lovely noticed that she had made a mistake in
their heads. And she was troubled and did not know what to do.

 

When the goblin had told this story, he asked the king: "O King, when
they were mingled in this way, which should be her husband? If you know
and do not tell, then the curse I spoke of will be fulfilled."

And the king said to the goblin: "The body with the husband's head on it
is her husband. For the head is the most important member. It is by the
head that we recognize people."

Then the goblin slipped from the king's shoulder as before, and quickly
disappeared. And the king went back, determined to catch him.
