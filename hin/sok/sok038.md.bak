### XXXVII

I. 36.

sûr parkâs', tanh rain kahâ<u>n</u> pâïye

WHERE is the night, when the sun is shining? If it is night, then the
sun withdraws its light. Where knowledge is, can ignorance endure? <span
id="page_85">p. 85</span> If there be ignorance, then knowledge must
die.  
If there be lust, how can love be there? Where there is love, there is
no lust.

Lay hold on your sword, and join in the fight. Fight, O my brother, as
long as life lasts.  
Strike off your enemy's head, and there make an end of him quickly: then
come, and bow your head at your King's Durbar.  
He who is brave, never forsakes the battle: he who flies from it is no
true fighter.  
In the field of this body a great war goes forward, against passion,
anger, pride, and greed:  
It is in the kingdom of truth, contentment and purity, that this battle
is raging; and the sword that rings forth most loudly is the sword of
His Name. <span id="page_86">p. 86</span>  
Kabîr says: "When a brave knight takes the field, a host of cowards is
put to flight.  
It is a hard fight and a weary one, this fight of the truth-seeker: for
the vow of the truth-seeker is more hard than that of the warrior, or of
the widowed wife who would follow her husband.  
For the warrior fights for a few hours, and the widow's struggle with
death is soon ended:  
But the truth-seeker's battle goes on day and night, as long as life
lasts it never ceases."
