<p>THIS day is dear to me above all other days, for to-day the Beloved Lord is a guest in my house;<br> MY chamber and my courtyard are beautiful with His presence.<br> My longings sing His Name, and they are become lost in His great beauty:<br> I wash His feet, and I look upon His Face; and I lay before Him as an <a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A> offering my body, my mind, and all that I have.<br> What a day of gladness is that day in which my Beloved, who is my treasure, comes to my house!<br> All evils fly from my heart when I see my Lord.<br> "My love has touched Him; my heart is longing for the Name which is Truth."<br> Thus sings Kab&icirc;r, the servant of all servants.</p>
