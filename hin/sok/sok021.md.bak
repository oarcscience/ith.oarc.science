man tu pâr utar kâ<u>n</u>h jaiho

To what shore would you cross, O my heart? there is no traveller before
you, there is no road:  
Where is the movement, where is the rest, on that shore?  
There is no water; no boat, no boatman, is there;  
There is not so much as a rope to tow the boat, nor a man to draw it.  
No earth, no sky, no time, no thing, is there: no shore, no ford!  
There, there is neither body nor mind: and where is the place that shall
still the thirst of the soul? You shall find naught in that emptiness.  
Be strong, and enter into your own <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> body:
for there your foothold is firm. Consider it well, O my heart! go not
elsewhere,  
Kabîr says: "Put all imaginations away, and stand fast in that which you
are."
