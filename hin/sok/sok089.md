### LXXXVIII

III\. 118.

âj din ke mai<u>n</u> jau<u>n</u> balihârî

THIS day is dear to me above all other days, for to-day the Beloved Lord
is a guest in my house;  
MY chamber and my courtyard are beautiful with His presence.  
My longings sing His Name, and they are become lost in His great
beauty:  
I wash His feet, and I look upon His Face; and I lay before Him as an
<span id="page_135">p. 135</span> offering my body, my mind, and all
that I have.  
What a day of gladness is that day in which my Beloved, who is my
treasure, comes to my house!  
All evils fly from my heart when I see my Lord.  
"My love has touched Him; my heart is longing for the Name which is
Truth."  
Thus sings Kabîr, the servant of all servants.
