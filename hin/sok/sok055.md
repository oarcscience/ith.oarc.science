### LIV

I. 112.

s'untâ nahî dhun kî khabar

HAVE you not heard the tune which the Unstruck Music is playing? In the
midst of the chamber the harp of joy is gently and sweetly played; and
where is the need of going without to hear it?  
If you have not drunk of the nectar of that One Love, what boots it
though you should purge yourself of all stains?  
The Kazi is searching the words of the Koran, and instructing others:
<span id="page_100">p. 100</span> but if his heart be not steeped in
that love, what does it avail, though he be a teacher of men?  
The Yogi dyes his garments with red: but if he knows naught of that
colour of love, what does it avail though his garments be tinted?  
Kabîr says: "Whether I be in the temple or the balcony, in the camp or
in the flower garden, I tell you truly that every moment my Lord is
taking His delight in me."
