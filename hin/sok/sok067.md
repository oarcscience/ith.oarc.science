### LXVI

I. 20.

man na ra**n**gâye

THE Yogi dyes his garments, instead of dyeing his mind in the colours of
love: <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>  
He sits within the temple of the Lord, leaving Brahma to worship a
stone.  
He pierces holes in his ears, he has a great beard and matted locks, he
looks like a goat:  
He goes forth into the wilderness, killing all his desires, and turns
himself into an eunuch:  
He shaves his head and dyes his garments; he reads the Gîtâ and becomes
a mighty talker.  
Kabîr says: "You are going to the doors of death, bound hand and foot!"
