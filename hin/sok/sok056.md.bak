### LV

I. 73.

bhakti kâ mârag jhînâ re

SUBTLE is the path of love!  
Therein there is no asking and no not-asking,  
There one loses one's self at His feet,  
There one is immersed in the joy of the seeking: plunged in the deeps of
love as the fish in the water. <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>  
The lover is never slow in offering his head for his Lord's service.  
Kabîr declares the secret of this love.
