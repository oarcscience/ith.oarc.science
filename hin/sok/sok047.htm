<p>I. 98. <i>s&acirc;dho, sahajai k&acirc;y&acirc; s'odho</p> </i>
<p>O SADHU! purify your body in the simple way.<br> As the seed is within the banyan tree, and within the seed are the flowers, the fruits, and the shade:<br> So the germ is within the body, and within that germ is the body again.<br> The fire, the air, the water, the earth, and the aether; you cannot have these outside of Him.<br> O, Kazi, O Pundit, consider it well: what is there that is not in the soul?<br> The water-filled pitcher is placed upon water, it has water within and without.<br> It should not be given a name, lest it call forth the error of dualism.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "Listen to the Word, the Truth, which is your essence. He <a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></A> speaks the Word to Himself; and He Himself is the Creator."</p>
