### XLVI

I. 98.

sâdho, sahajai kâyâ s'odho

O SADHU! purify your body in the simple way.  
As the seed is within the banyan tree, and within the seed are the
flowers, the fruits, and the shade:  
So the germ is within the body, and within that germ is the body
again.  
The fire, the air, the water, the earth, and the aether; you cannot have
these outside of Him.  
O, Kazi, O Pundit, consider it well: what is there that is not in the
soul?  
The water-filled pitcher is placed upon water, it has water within and
without.  
It should not be given a name, lest it call forth the error of
dualism.  
Kabîr says: "Listen to the Word, the Truth, which is your essence. He
<span id="page_94">p. 94</span> speaks the Word to Himself; and He
Himself is the Creator."
