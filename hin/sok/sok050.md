Underhill, \[1915\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### XLIX

I. 105.

jo dîsai, so to hai nâhî

n

THAT which you see is not: and for that which is, you have no words.  
Unless you see, you believe not: what is told you you cannot accept.  
He who is discerning knows by the word; and the ignorant stands gaping.
<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>  
Some contemplate the Formless, and others meditate on form: but the wise
man knows that Brahma is beyond both.  
That beauty of His is not seen of the eye: that metre of His is not
heard of the ear.  
Kabîr says: "He who has found both love and renunciation never descends
to death."
