### VI

I. 83.

candâ jhalkai yahi gha**t** mâhî

THE moon shines in my body, but my blind eyes cannot see it:  
The moon is within me, and so is the sun.  
The unstruck drum of Eternity is sounded within me; but my deaf ears
cannot hear it.

So long as man clamours for the *I* and the *Mine*, his works are as
naught:  
When all love of the *I* and the *Mine* is dead, then the work of the
Lord is done.  
For work has no other aim than the getting of knowledge:  
When that comes, then work is put away.

The flower blooms for the fruit: when the fruit comes, the flower
withers. <span id="page_50">p. 50</span>  
The musk is in the deer, but it seeks it not within itself: it wanders
in quest of grass.
