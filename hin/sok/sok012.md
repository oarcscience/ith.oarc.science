### XI

I. 131.

nis' din khelat rahî sakhiyâ<u>n</u> sa**n**g

I PLAYED day and night with my comrades, and now I am greatly afraid.  
So high is my Lord's palace, my heart trembles to mount its stairs: yet
I must not be shy, if I would enjoy His love.  
My heart must cleave to my Lover; I must withdraw my veil, and meet Him
with all my body: <span id="page_55">p. 55</span>  
Mine eyes must perform the ceremony of the lamps of love.  
Kabîr says: "Listen to me, friend: he understands who loves. If you feel
not love's longing for your Beloved One, it is vain to adorn your body,
vain to put unguent on your eyelids."
