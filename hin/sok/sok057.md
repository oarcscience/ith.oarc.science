### LVI

I. 68.

bhâi kôî satguru sant kahâwaî

HE is the real Sadhu, who can reveal the form of the Formless to the
vision of these eyes:  
Who teaches the simple way of attaining Him, that is other than rites or
ceremonies:  
Who does not make you close the doors, and hold the breath, and renounce
the world:  
Who makes you perceive the Supreme Spirit wherever the mind attaches
itself:  
Who teaches you to be still in the midst of all your activities.  
Ever immersed in bliss, having no fear in his mind, he keeps the spirit
of <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> union in the midst of all
enjoyments.  
The infinite dwelling of the Infinite Being is everywhere: in earth,
water, sky, and air:  
Firm as the thunderbolt, the seat of the seeker is established above the
void.  
He who is within is without: I see Him and none else.
