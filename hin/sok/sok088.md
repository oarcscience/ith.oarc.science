### LXXXVII

I. 71.

gagan gha**t**â ghaharânî, sâdho

CLOUDS thicken in the sky! O, listen to the deep voice of their
roaring;  
The rain comes from the east with its monotonous murmur.  
Take care of the fences and boundaries <span id="page_134">p. 134</span>
of your fields, lest the rains overflow them;  
Prepare the soil of deliverance, and let the creepers of love and
renunciation be soaked in this shower.  
It is the prudent farmer who will bring his harvest home; he shall fill
both his vessels, and feed both the wise men and the saints.
