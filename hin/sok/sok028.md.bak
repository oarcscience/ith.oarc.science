II\. 81.

satgur sôî dayâ kar dînhâ

IT is the mercy of my true Guru that has made me to know the unknown;  
I have learned from Him how to walk without feet, to see without eyes,
to hear without ears, to drink <span id="page_76">p. 76</span> without
mouth, to fly without wings;  
I have brought my love and my meditation into the land where there is no
sun and moon, nor day and night.  
Without eating, I have tasted of the sweetness of nectar; and without
water, I have quenched my thirst.  
Where there is the response of delight, there is the fullness of joy.
Before whom can that joy be uttered?  
Kabîr says: "The Guru is great beyond words, and great is the good
fortune of the disciple."
