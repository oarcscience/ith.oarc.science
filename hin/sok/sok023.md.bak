### XXII

II\. 38.

Sâdho, so satgur mohi bhâwai

O BROTHER, my heart yearns for that true Guru, who fills the cup of true
love, and drinks of it himself, and offers it then to me.  
He removes the veil from the eyes, and gives the true Vision of
Brahma:  
He reveals the worlds in Him, and <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> makes
me to hear the Unstruck Music:  
He shows joy and sorrow to be one:  
He fills all utterance with love.  
Kabîr says: "Verily he has no fear, who has such a Guru to lead him to
the shelter of safety!"
