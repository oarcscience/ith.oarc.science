### XCV

I. 109.

sâî<u>n</u> ke sa**n**gat sâsur âî

CAME with my Lord to my Lord's home: but I lived not with Him and I
tasted Him not, and my youth passed away like a dream.  
On my wedding night my women-friends sang in chorus, and I was anointed
with the unguents of pleasure and pain:  
But when the ceremony was over, I left my Lord and came away, and my
kinsman tried to console me upon the road.  
Kabîr says, "I shall go to my Lord's house with my love at my side; then
shall I sound the trumpet of triumph!"
