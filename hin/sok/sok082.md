### LXXXI

III\. 74.

pratham ek jo âpai âp

IN the beginning was He alone, sufficient unto Himself: the formless,
colourless, and unconditioned Being.  
Then was there neither beginning, middle, nor end;  
Then were no eyes, no darkness, no light;  
Then were no ground, air, nor sky; no fire, water, nor earth; no rivers
like the Ganges and the Jumna, no seas, oceans, and waves.  
Then was neither vice nor virtue; scriptures there were not, as the
Vedas and Puranas, nor as the Koran.  
Kabîr ponders in his mind and says, "Then was there no activity: the
Supreme Being remained merged in the unknown depths of His own self."

The Guru neither eats nor drinks, neither lives nor dies:  
Neither has He form, line, colour, nor vesture.  
He who has neither caste nor clan nor anything else--how may I describe
His glory?  
He has neither form nor formlessness,  
He has no name,  
He has neither colour nor colourlessness,  
He has no dwelling-place.
