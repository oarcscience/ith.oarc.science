II\. 33.

LAMPS burn in every house, O blind one! and you cannot see them.  
One day your eyes shall suddenly be opened, and you shall see: and the
fetters of death will fall from you.  
There is nothing to say or to hear, there is nothing to do: it is he who
is living, yet dead, who shall never die again.

Because he lives in solitude, therefore the Yogi says that his home is
far away. <span id="page_71">p. 71</span>  
Your Lord is near: yet you are climbing the palm-tree to seek Him.  
The Brâhman priest goes from house to house and initiates people into
faith:  
Alas! the true fountain of life is beside you., and you have set up a
stone to worship.  
Kabîr says: "I may never express how sweet my Lord is. Yoga and the
telling of beads, virtue and vice--these are naught to Him."
