### XXVI

II\. 75.

ô<u>n</u>kâr siwae kôî sirjai

ALL things are created by the Om;  
The love-form is His body.  
He is without form, without quality, without decay:  
Seek thou union with Him! <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>  
But that formless God takes a thousand forms in the eyes of His
creatures:  
He is pure and indestructible,  
His form is infinite and fathomless,  
He dances in rapture, and waves of form arise from His dance.  
The body and the mind cannot contain themselves, when they are touched
by His great joy.  
He is immersed in all consciousness, all joys, and all sorrows;  
He has no beginning and no end;  
He holds all within His bliss.
