II\. 56.

dariyâ kî lahar dariyâo hai jî

THE river and its waves are one  
surf: where is the difference between the river and its waves?  
When the wave rises, it is the water; and when it falls, it is the same
water again. Tell me, Sir, where is the distinction?  
Because it has been named as wave, shall it no longer be considered as
water?

Within the Supreme Brahma, the worlds are being told like beads:  
Look upon that rosary with the eyes of wisdom.
