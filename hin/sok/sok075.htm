<p>III. 30. <i>are dil, prem nagar k&auml; ant na p&acirc;y&acirc;</p> </i>
<p>O MY heart! you have not known all the secrets of this city of love: in ignorance you came, and in ignorance you return.<br> O my friend, what have you done with this life? You have taken on your head the burden heavy with stones, and who is to lighten it for you? <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="green">p. 117</font></A><br> Your Friend stands on the other shore, but you never think in your mind how you may meet with Him:<br> The boat is broken, and yet you sit ever upon the bank; and thus you are beaten to no purpose by the waves.<br> The servant Kab&icirc;r asks you to consider; who is there that shall befriend you at the last?<br> You are alone, you have no companion: you will suffer the consequences of your own deeds.</p>
