### LI

I. 129.

sakhiyo, ham hû<u>n</u> bhâî vâlamâs'î

DEAR friend, I am eager to meet my Beloved! My youth has flowered, and
the pain of separation from Him troubles my breast.  
I am wandering yet in the alleys of knowledge without purpose, but I
have received His news in these alleys of knowledge.  
I have a letter from my Beloved: in this letter is an unutterable
message, and now my fear of death is done away.  
Kabîr says: "O my loving friend! I have got for my gift the Deathless
One."
