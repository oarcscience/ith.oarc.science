### LXIV

I. 117.

sâî<u>n</u> se lagan ka**t**hin hai, bhâî

NOW hard it is to meet my Lord!  
The rain-bird wails in thirst for the rain: almost she dies of her
longing, yet she would have none other water than the rain.  
Drawn by the love of music, the deer moves forward: she dies as she
listens to the music, yet she shrinks not in fear. <span

The widowed wife sits by the body of her dead husband: she is not afraid
of the fire.  
Put away all fear for this poor body.
