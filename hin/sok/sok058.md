### LVII

I. 66.

sâdho, s'abd sâdhnâ kîjai

RECEIVE that Word from which the Universe springeth!  
That word is the Guru; I have heard it, and become the disciple.  
How many are there who know the meaning of that word?

O Sadhu! practise that Word!  
The Vedas and the Puranas proclaim it,  
The world is established in it, <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>  
The Rishis and devotees speak of it:  
But none knows the mystery of the Word.  
The householder leaves his house when he hears it,  
The ascetic comes back to love when he hears it,  
The Six Philosophies expound it,  
The Spirit of Renunciation points to that Word,  
From that Word the world-form has sprung,  
That Word reveals all.  
Kabîr says: "But who knows whence the Word cometh?
