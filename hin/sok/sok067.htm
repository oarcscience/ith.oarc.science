<p>I. 20. <i>man na ra<b>n</b>g&acirc;ye</p> </i>
<p>THE Yogi dyes his garments, instead of dyeing his mind in the colours of love: <a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></A><br> He sits within the temple of the Lord, leaving Brahma to worship a stone.<br> He pierces holes in his ears, he has a great beard and matted locks, he looks like a goat:<br> He goes forth into the wilderness, killing all his desires, and turns himself into an eunuch:<br> He shaves his head and dyes his garments; he reads the G&icirc;t&acirc; and becomes a mighty talker.<br> Kab&icirc;r says: "You are going to the doors of death, bound hand and foot!"</p>
