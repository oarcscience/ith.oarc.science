### III

I. 57.

sâdho bhâî, jîval hî karo âs'â

O FRIEND! hope for Him whilst you live, know whilst you live, understand
whilst you live: for in life deliverance abides.  
If your bonds be not broken whilst living, what hope of deliverance in
death? <span id="page_47">p. 47</span>  
It is but an empty dream, that the soul shall have union with Him
because it has passed from the body:  
If He is found now, He is found then,  
If not, we do but go to dwell in the City of Death.  
If you have union now, you shall have it hereafter.  
Bathe in the truth, know the true Guru, have faith in the true Name!  
Kabîr says: "It is the Spirit of the quest which helps; I am the slave
of this Spirit of the quest."
