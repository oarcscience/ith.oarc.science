avadhû bhûle ko ghar lâwe

HE is dear to me indeed who can call back the wanderer to his home. In
the home is the true union, in the home is enjoyment of life: why should
I forsake my home and wander in the forest? <span id="page_88">p.
88</span> If Brahma helps me to realize truth, verily I will find both
bondage and deliverance in home.  
He is dear to me indeed who has power to dive deep into Brahma; whose
mind loses itself with ease in His contemplation.  
He is dear to me who knows Brahma, and can dwell on His supreme truth in
meditation; and who can play the melody of the Infinite by uniting love
and renunciation in life.  
Kabîr says: "The home is the abiding place; in the home is reality; the
home helps to attain Him Who is real. So stay where you are, and all
things shall come to you in time."
