### VII

I. 85.

Sâdho, Brahm alakh lakhâyâ

WHEN He Himself reveals Himself, Brahma brings into manifestation That
which can never be seen.  
As the seed is in the plant, as the shade is in the tree, as the void is
in the sky, as infinite forms are in the void--  
So from beyond the Infinite, the Infinite comes; and from the Infinite
the finite extends.

The creature is in Brahma, and Brahma is in the creature: they are ever
distinct, yet ever united.  
He Himself is the tree, the seed, and the germ. <span id="page_51">p.
51</span>  
He Himself is the flower, the fruit, and the shade.  
He Himself is the sun, the light, and the lighted.  
He Himself is Brahma, creature, and Maya.  
He Himself is the manifold form, the infinite space;  
He is the breath, the word, and the meaning.  
He Himself is the limit and the limitless: and beyond both the limited
and the limitless is He, the Pure Being.  
He is the Immanent Mind in Brahma and in the creature.

The Supreme Soul is seen within the soul,  
The Point is seen within the Supreme Soul,  
And within the Point, the reflection is seen again. <span
id="page_52">p. 52</span>  
Kabîr is blest because he has this supreme vision!
