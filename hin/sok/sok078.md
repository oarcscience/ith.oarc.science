cal ha**m**sâ wâ des' jahâ

n

O MY heart! let us go to that country where dwells the Beloved, the
ravisher of my heart!  
There Love is filling her pitcher from the well, yet she has no rope
wherewith to draw water;  
There the clouds do not cover the sky, yet the rain falls down in gentle
showers:  
O bodiless one! do not sit on your doorstep; go forth and bathe yourself
in that rain!  
There it is ever moonlight and never dark; and who speaks of one sun
only? that land is illuminate with the rays of a million suns.
