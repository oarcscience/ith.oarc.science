### LXXIII

III\. 26.

âyau din gaune kâ ho

THE palanquin came to take me away to my husband's home, and it sent
through my heart a thrill of joy;  
But the bearers have brought me into the lonely forest, where I have no
one of my own. <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>  
O bearers, I entreat you by your feet, wait but a moment longer: let me
go back to my kinsmen and friends, and take my leave of them.  
The servant Kabîr sings: "O Sadhu! finish your buying and selling, have
done with your good and your bad: for there are no markets and no shops
in the land to which you go."
