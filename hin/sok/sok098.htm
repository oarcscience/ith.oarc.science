<p>II. 90. <i>s&acirc;hab ham me<u>n</u>, s&acirc;hab tum me<u>n</p> </i></u>
<p>THE Lord is in me, the Lord is in you, as life is in every seed. O servant! put false pride away, and seek for Him within you.<br> A million suns are ablaze with light,<br> The sea of blue spreads in the sky,<br> The fever of life is stilled, and all stains are washed away; when I sit in the midst of that world.<br> Hark to the unstruck bells and drums! Take your delight in love!<br> Rains pour down without water, and the rivers are streams of light.<br> One Love it is that pervades the whole world, few there are who know it fully:<br> They are blind who hope to see it by the light of reason, that reason which is the cause of separation--<br> The House of Reason is very far away! <a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></A><br> How blessed is Kab&icirc;r, that amidst this great joy he sings within his own vessel.<br> It is the music of the meeting of soul with soul;<br> It is the music of the forgetting of sorrows;<br> It is the music that transcends all coming in and all going forth.</p>
