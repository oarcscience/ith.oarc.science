### LXIII

I. 39.

are man, dhîraj kâhe na dharai

WHY so impatient, my heart?  
He who watches over birds, beasts, and insects, <span id="page_107">p.

He who cared for you whilst you were yet in your mother's womb,  
Shall He not care for you now that you are come forth?

so far from Him?  
You have left Your Beloved and are thinking of others: and this is why
all your work is in vain.
