### LXXVIII

III\. 63.

kahai<u>n</u> Kabîr, s'uno ho sâdho

KABÎR says: "O Sadhu! hear my deathless words. If you want your own
good, examine and consider them well.  
You have estranged yourself from the Creator, of whom you have sprung:
you have lost your reason, you have bought death.  
All doctrines and all teachings are sprung from Him, from Him they grow:
know this for certain, and have no fear.  
Hear from me the tidings of this great truth!  
Whose name do you sing, and on whom do you meditate? O, come forth from
this entanglement!  
He dwells at the heart of all things, so why take refuge in empty
desolation? <span id="page_124">p. 124</span>  
If you place the Guru at a distance from you, then it is but the
distance that you honour:  
If indeed the Master be far away, then who is it else that is creating
this world?  
When you think that He is not here, then you wander further and further
away, and seek Him in vain with tears.  
Where He is far off, there He is unattainable: where He is near, He is
very bliss.  
Kabîr says: "Lest His servant should suffer pain He pervades him through
and through."  
Know yourself then, O Kabîr; for He is in you from head to foot.  
Sing with gladness, and keep your seat unmoved within your heart.
