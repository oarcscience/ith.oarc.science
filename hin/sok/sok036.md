### XXXV

II\. 113.

vâlam, âwo hamâre geh re

MY body and my mind are grieved for the want of Thee;  
O my Beloved! come to my house. <span id="page_83">p. 83</span>  
When people say I am Thy bride, I am ashamed; for I have not touched Thy
heart with my heart.  
Then what is this love of mine? I have no taste for food, I have no
sleep; my heart is ever restless within doors and without.  
As water is to the thirsty, so is the lover to the bride. Who is there
that will carry my news to my Beloved?  
Kabîr is restless: he is dying for sight of Him.
