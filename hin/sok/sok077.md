III\. 48.

tû surat nain nihâr

OPEN your eyes of love, and see Him who pervades this world I consider
it well, and know that this is your own country.  
When you meet the true Guru, He will awaken your heart;  
He will tell you the secret of love and detachment, and then you will
know indeed that He transcends this universe. <span id="page_119">p.
119</span>  
This world is the City of Truth, its maze of paths enchants the heart:  
We can reach the goal without crossing the road, such is the sport
unending.  
Where the ring of manifold joys ever dances about Him, there is the
sport of Eternal Bliss.  
When we know this, then all our receiving and renouncing is over;  
Thenceforth the heat of having shall never scorch us more.

He is the Ultimate Rest unbounded:  
He has spread His form of love throughout all the world.  
From that Ray which is Truth, streams of new forms are perpetually
springing: and He pervades those forms.  
All the gardens and groves and bowers are abounding with blossom; and
the air breaks forth into ripples of joy. <span id="page_120">p.
120</span>  
There the swan plays a wonderful game,  
There the Unstruck Music eddies around the Infinite One;  
There in the midst the Throne of the Unheld is shining, whereon the
great Being sits--  
Millions of suns are shamed by the radiance of a single hair of His
body.  
On the harp of the road what true melodies are being sounded! and its
notes pierce the heart:  
There the Eternal Fountain is playing its endless life-streams of birth
and death.  
They call Him Emptiness who is the Truth of truths, in Whom all truths
are stored!

There within Him creation goes forward, which is beyond all philosophy;
for philosophy cannot attain to Him: <span id="page_121">p. 121</span>  
There is an endless world, O my Brother! and there is the Nameless
Being, of whom naught can be said.  
Only he knows it who has reached that region: it is other than all that
is heard and said.  
No form, no body, no length, no breadth is seen there: how can I tell
you that which it is?  
He comes to the Path of the Infinite on whom the grace of the Lord
descends: he is freed from births and deaths who attains to Him.  
Kabîr says: "It cannot be told by the words of the mouth, it cannot be
written on paper:  
It is like a dumb person who tastes a sweet thing--how shall it be
explained?"
