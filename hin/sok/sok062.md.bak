### LXI

I. 48.

sukh sâgar me<u>n</u> âîke

WHEN at last you are come to the ocean of happiness, do not go back
thirsty.  
Wake, foolish man! for Death stalks you. Here is pure water before you;
drink it at every breath.  
Do not follow the mirage on foot, but thirst for the nectar;  
Dhruva, Prahlad, and Shukadeva have drunk of it, and also Raidas has
tasted it:  
The saints are drunk with love, their thirst is for love.  
Kabîr says: "Listen to me, brother! The nest of fear is broken.  
Not for a moment have you come face to face with the world: <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span>  
You are weaving your bondage of falsehood, your words are full of
deception:  
With the load of desires which you. hold on your head, how can you be
light?"  
Kabîr says: "Keep within you truth, detachment, and love."
