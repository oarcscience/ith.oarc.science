II\. 122.

kôî prem kî peng jhulâo re

HANG up the swing of love to-day! Hang the body and the mind between the
arms of the Beloved, in the ecstasy of love's joy:  
Bring the tearful streams of the rainy clouds to your eyes, and cover
your heart with the shadow of darkness:  
Bring your face nearer to His ear, and speak of the deepest longings of
your heart.  
Kabîr says: "Listen to me, brother! bring the vision of the Beloved in
your heart."
