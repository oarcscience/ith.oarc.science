I. 16.

Santan jât na pûcho nirgu**n**iyâ

n

It is needless to ask of a saint the caste to which he belongs; <span
id="page_46">p. 46</span>  
For the priest, the warrior. the tradesman, and all the thirty-six
castes, alike are seeking for God.  
It is but folly to ask what the caste of a saint may be;  
The barber has sought God, the washerwoman, and the carpenter--  
Even Raidas was a seeker after God.  
The Rishi Swapacha was a tanner by caste.  
Hindus and Moslems alike have achieved that End, where remains no mark
of distinction.
