### XXXIII

II\. 105.

man mast huâ tab kyo<u>n</u> bole

WHERE is the need of words, when love has made drunken the heart?  
I have wrapped the diamond in my cloak; why open it again and again?  
When its load was light, the pan of the balance went up: now it is full,
where is the need for weighing?  
The swan has taken its flight to the lake beyond the mountains; why
should it search for the pools and ditches any more?  
Your Lord dwells within you: why need your outward eyes be opened?  
Kabîr says: "Listen, my brother! my Lord, who ravishes my eyes, has
united Himself with me."
