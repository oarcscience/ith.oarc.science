### LXX

III\. 9.

s'îl santosh sadâ samad**r**ish**t**i

HE who is meek and contented., he who has an equal vision, whose mind is
filled with the fullness of acceptance and of rest;  
He who has seen Him and touched Him, he is freed from all fear and
trouble.  
To him the perpetual thought of God is like sandal paste smeared on the
body, to him nothing else is delight:  
His work and his rest are filled with music: he sheds abroad the
radiance of love.  
Kabîr says: "Touch His feet, who is one and indivisible, immutable and
peaceful; who fills all vessels to the brim with joy, and whose form is
love."
