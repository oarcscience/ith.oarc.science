### LXXIV

III\. 30.

are dil, prem nagar kä ant na pâyâ

O MY heart! you have not known all the secrets of this city of love: in
ignorance you came, and in ignorance you return.  
O my friend, what have you done with this life? You have taken on your
head the burden heavy with stones, and who is to lighten it for you?
<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>  
Your Friend stands on the other shore, but you never think in your mind
how you may meet with Him:  
The boat is broken, and yet you sit ever upon the bank; and thus you are
beaten to no purpose by the waves.  
The servant Kabîr asks you to consider; who is there that shall befriend
you at the last?  
You are alone, you have no companion: you will suffer the consequences
of your own deeds.
