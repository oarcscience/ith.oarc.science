THE Lord is in me, the Lord is in you, as life is in every seed. O
servant! put false pride away, and seek for Him within you.  
A million suns are ablaze with light,  
The sea of blue spreads in the sky,  
The fever of life is stilled, and all stains are washed away; when I sit
in the midst of that world.  
Hark to the unstruck bells and drums! Take your delight in love!  
Rains pour down without water, and the rivers are streams of light.  
One Love it is that pervades the whole world, few there are who know it
fully:  
They are blind who hope to see it by the light of reason, that reason
which is the cause of separation--  
The House of Reason is very far away! <span id="page_143">p.

How blessed is Kabîr, that amidst this great joy he sings within his own
vessel.  
It is the music of the meeting of soul with soul;  
It is the music of the forgetting of sorrows;  
It is the music that transcends all coming in and all going forth.
