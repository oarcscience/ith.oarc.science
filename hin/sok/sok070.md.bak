### LXIX

III\. 2.

jo khodâ masjid vasat hai

IF God be within the mosque, then to whom does this world belong?  
If Ram be within the image which you find upon your pilgrimage, then who
is there to know what happens without?  
Hari is in the East: Allah is in the West. Look within your heart, for
there you will find both Karim and Ram;  
All the men and women of the world are His living forms.  
Kabîr is the child of Allah and of Ram: He is my Guru, He is my Pir.
