### XCII

III\. 110.

carkhâ calai surat virahin kâ

THE woman who is parted from her lover spins at the spinning wheel.  
The city of the body arises in its beauty; and within it the palace of
the mind has been built.  
The wheel of love revolves in the sky, and the seat is made of the
jewels of knowledge:  
What subtle threads the woman weaves, and makes them fine with love and
reverence! <span id="page_138">p. 138</span>  
Kabîr says: "I am weaving the garland of day and night. When my Lover
comes and touches me with His feet, I shall offer Him my tears."
