### XXXVI

II\. 126.

jâg piyârî, ab kâ<u>n</u> sowai

O FRIEND, awake, and sleep no more!  
The night is over and gone, would you lose your day also?  
Others, who have wakened, have received jewels; <span id="page_84">p.

O foolish woman! you have lost all whilst you slept.  
Your lover is wise, and you are foolish, O woman!  
You never prepared the bed of your husband:  
O mad one! you passed your time in silly play.  
Your youth was passed in vain, for you did not know your Lord;  
Wake, wake! See! your bed is empty: He left you in the night.  
Kabîr says: "Only she wakes, whose heart is pierced with the arrow of
His music."
