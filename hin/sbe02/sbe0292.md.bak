### CHAPTER XXVIII.

1\. After the father's death let the sons divide his estate, <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[1](#fn_1482.md)

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

2\. Or, during his lifetime, when the mother is past child-bearing, if
he desires it, <span id="fr_1484"></span>[2](#fn_1483.md)

3\. Or the whole (estate may go) to the first-born; (and) he shall
support (the rest) as a father. <span id="fr_1485"></span>[3](#fn_1484.md)

4\. But in partition there is an increase of spiritual merit. <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[4](#fn_1485.md)

5\. (The additional share) of the eldest (son consists of) a twentieth
part (of the estate), a male and a female (of animals with one row of
front teeth, such as cows), a carriage yoked with animals that have two
rows of front teeth, (and) a bull. <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[5](#fn_1486.md)

6\. (The additional share) of the middlemost (consists of) the one-eyed,
old, hornless, and tailless animals, if there are several. <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[6](#fn_1487.md)

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

7\. (The additional share) of the youngest (consists of) the sheep,
grain, the iron (utensils), a house, a cart yoked (with oxen), and one
of each kind of (other) animals. <span id="fr_1489"></span>[7](#fn_1488.md)

8\. All the remaining (property shall be divided) equally. <span
id="fr_1490"></span>[8](#fn_1489.md)

9\. Or let the eldest have two shares, <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[9](#fn_1490.md)

10\. And the rest one each. <span id="fr_1492"></span>[10](#fn_1491.md)

11\. Or let them each take one kind of property, (selecting), according
to seniority, what they desire, <span id="fr_1493"></span>[11](#fn_1492.md)

12\. Ten head of cattle. <span id="fr_1494"></span>[12](#fn_1493.md)

13\. (But) no (one brother shall) take (ten) one-hoofed beasts or (ten)
slaves. <span id="fr_1495"></span>[13](#fn_1494.md)

14\. (If a man has several wives) the additional <span
id="fr_1496"></span>[14](#fn_1495.md)

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

share of the eldest son is one bull (in case he be born of a
later-married wife);

15\. (But the eldest son) being born of the first-married wife (shall
have) fifteen cows and one bull; <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[15](#fn_1496.md)

16\. Or (let the eldest son) who is born of a later-married wife (share
the estate) equally with his younger (brethren born of the first-married
wife). <span id="fr_1498"></span>[16](#fn_1497.md)

17\. Or let the special shares (be adjusted) in each class (of sons)
according to their mothers. <span id="fr_1499"></span>[17](#fn_1498.md)

18\. A father who has no (male) issue may appoint his daughter (to raise
up a son for him), presenting burnt offerings, to Agni (fire) and to
Pra*g*âpati (the lord of creatures), and addressing (the bridegroom with
these words), 'For me be (thy male) offspring.' <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[18](#fn_1499.md)

19\. Some declare, that (a daughter becomes) an appointed daughter
solely by the intention (of the father).

20\. Through fear of that (a man) should not marry a girl who has no
brothers. <span id="fr_1501"></span>[20](#fn_1500.md)

21\. Sapi*nd*as (blood relations within six degrees), Sagotras
(relations bearing a common family name), (or) those connected by
descent from the same *Ri*shi <span id="fr_1502"></span>[21](#fn_1501.md)

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (vaidika gotra), and the wife shall share (the
estate) of a person deceased without (male) issue (or an appointed
daughter).

22\. Or (the widow) may seek to raise up offspring (to her deceased
husband). <span id="fr_1503"></span>[22](#fn_1502.md)

23\. (A son) begotten on a (widow) whose husband's brother lives, by
another (relative), is excluded from inheritance. <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[23](#fn_1503.md)

24\. A woman's separate property (goes) to her unmarried daughters, and
(on failure of such) to poor (married daughters). <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[24](#fn_1504.md)

25\. The sister's fee belongs to her uterine brothers, if her mother be
dead. <span id="fr_1506"></span>[25](#fn_1505.md)

26\. Some (declare, that it belongs to them) even while the mother
lives. <span id="fr_1507"></span>[26](#fn_1506.md)

27\. The heritage of not reunited (brothers) deceased <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[27](#fn_1507.md)

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (without male issue goes) to the eldest
(brother).

28\. If a reunited coparcener dies (without male issue) his reunited
coparcener takes the heritage. <span id="fr_1509"></span>[28](#fn_1508.md)

29\. A son born after partition takes exclusively (the wealth) of his
father. <span id="fr_1510"></span>[29](#fn_1509.md)

30\. What a learned (coparcener) has acquired by his own efforts, he may
(at his pleasure) withhold from his unlearned (coparceners). <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[30](#fn_1510.md)

31\. Unlearned (coparceners) shall divide (their acquisitions)
equally. <span id="fr_1512"></span>[31](#fn_1511.md)

32\. A legitimate son, a son begotten on the wife (by a kinsman), an
adopted son, a son made, a son born secretly, and a son abandoned (by
his natural parents) inherit the estate (of their fathers). <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[32](#fn_1512.md)

33\. The son of an unmarried damsel, the son of a pregnant bride, the
son of a twice-married woman, the son of an appointed daughter, a son
self-given, and a son bought belong to the family (of their fathers).

34\. On failure of a legitimate son or (of the) <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[34](#fn_1513.md)

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

other (five heirs) they receive a fourth (of the estate).

35\. The son of a Brâhma*n*a by a Kshatriya wife, being the eldest and
endowed with good qualities, shares equally (with a younger brother,
born of a Brâhma*n*î); <span id="fr_1515"></span>[35](#fn_1514.md)

36\. (But he shall) not (obtain) the additional share of an eldest
son. <span id="fr_1516"></span>[36](#fn_1515.md)

37\. If there are sons begotten (by a Brâhma*n*a) on wives of the
Kshatriya and Vai*s*ya castes (the division of the estate between them
takes place according to the same rules) as (between) the (son by a
Kshatriya wife) and the son by a Brâhma*n*î. <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[37](#fn_1516.md)

38\. And (the sons by a Kshatriya wife and by

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

a Vai*s*ya wife share in the same manner) if (they have been begotten)
by a Kshatriya (father).

39\. The son by a *S*ûdra wife even, if he be obedient like a pupil,
receives a provision for maintenance (out of the estate) of a
(Brâhma*n*a) deceased without (other) male issue. <span
id="fr_1518"></span>[39](#fn_1517.md)

40\. According to some, the son of a woman of equal caste even does not
inherit, if he be living unrighteously. <span
id="fr_1519"></span>[40](#fn_1518.md)

41\. *S*rotriyas shall divide the estate of a childless
Brâhma*n*a. <span id="fr_1520"></span>[41](#fn_1519.md)

42\. The king (shall take the property of men) of other (castes). <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[42](#fn_1520.md)

43\. An idiot and a eunuch must be supported. <span
id="fr_1522"></span>[43](#fn_1521.md)

44\. The (male) offspring of an idiot receives (his father's)
share. <span id="fr_1523"></span>[44](#fn_1522.md)

45\. (Sons begotten) on women of higher castes (by men of lower castes
shall be treated) like sons (begotten by a Brâhma*n*a) on a *S*ûdra
wife. <span id="fr_1524"></span>[45](#fn_1523.md)

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

46\. Water, (property destined for) pious uses or sacrifices, and
prepared food shall not be divided; <span
id="fr_1525"></span>[46](#fn_1524.md)

47\. Nor (shall a partition be made) of women connected (with members of
the family). <span id="fr_1526"></span>[47](#fn_1525.md)

48\. In cases for which no rule has been given, (that course) must be
followed of which at least ten (Brâhma*n*as), who are well instructed,
skilled in reasoning, and free from covetousness, approve.

49\. They declare, that an assembly (parishad, shall consist) at least
(of the ten following (members, viz.) four men who have completely
studied the four Vedas, three men belonging to the (three) orders
enumerated first, (and) three men who know (three) different (institutes
of) law. <span id="fr_1527"></span>[49](#fn_1526.md)

50\. But on failure of them the decision of one *S*rotriya, who knows
the Veda and is properly instructed (in the duties, shall be followed)
in doubtful cases.

51\. For such a man is incapable of (unjustly) injuring or (unjustly)
favouring created beings.

52\. He who knows the sacred law obtains heavenly bliss, more than
(other) righteous men, on account of his knowledge of, and his adherence
to it.

53\. Thus the sacred law (has been explained).

id="page_303">p. 303</span> V, Digest 20; Mayûkha IV, 4, 3. Haradatta
remarks that, according to Gautama, the sons alone shall divide the
estate, and that the mother is not to receive a share, as other
teachers, e.g. Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 123, prescribe. Âpastamba II, 6, 13, 2
Manu IX, 104; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 117.

Mayûkha loc. cit. Or the sons may divide the estate even during the
lifetime of the father; when be desires it, i.e. by his permission. The
time for such a (division is) when the mother is past
child-bearing.'--Haradatta. The correctness of this interpretation of
our Sûtra is corroborated by the exclusion of sons who have divided the
family estate against the father's will (XV, 19) from the *S*râddha
dinner. Âpastamba II, 6, 14, 1.

<span id="fn_1485"></span>[303:4](sbe0292.htm#fr_1486.md) Colebrooke,
Dâyabhâga III, 1, 14; V, Digest 47. After division each brother has to
perform the Vai*s*vadeva and the other domestic ceremonies separately,
while in a united family they are performed by the eldest brother. Thus
a division of the family estate causes an increase of spiritual merit;
see also Manu XI, III.

number (is used to denote) the species, (and the explanation is), "As
many sheep as there are." For (the possession of) one would follow
already from the phrase, "And one of each kind of animals." Another
(commentator says), "Though the father may possess one sheep only, still
it belongs to the youngest, and the phrase 'one of each kind of animals'
refers to the case when there are many." . . . This (additional share is
that) belonging to the youngest. (If there are more than three sons) the
others obtain the share of the middle most.'--Haradatta.

and the next. The others read dvya*ms*î vâ pûrva*g*a*h* (not

there are sons (of each mother), let the eldest in each class (of
uterine brothers) receive the additional share of one-twentieth and so
forth.'--Haradatta.

'or the wife,' instead of stri *k*a, <span id="page_306">p. 306</span>
'and the wife.' Still the latter seems to be the reading recognised by
Haradatta, as he says, 'But the wife is joined together (samu*kk*îyate)
with all the Sagotras and the rest. When the Sagotras and the rest
inherit, then the wife shall inherit one share with them,' &c. Âpastamba

Dharma-*s*âstra declares (IX, 152-153), "Or (if no deduction be made),"
