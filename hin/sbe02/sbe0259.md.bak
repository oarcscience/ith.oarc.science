### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 9, KHA*ND*A 24.

1\. Now the Veda declares also one's offspring to be immortality (in
this verse): 'In thy offspring thou art born again, that, mortal, is thy
immortality.'

2\. Now it can also be perceived by the senses that the (father) has
been reproduced separately (in the son); for the likeness (of a father
and of a son) is even visible, only (their) bodies are different.

3\. 'These (sons) who live, fulfilling the rites taught (in the Veda),
increase the fame and heavenly bliss of their departed ancestors.'

4\. 'In this manner each succeeding (generation increases the fame and
heavenly bliss) of the preceding ones.'

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

5\. 'They (the ancestors) live in heaven until the (next) general
destruction of created things.'

6\. At the new creation (of, the world) they become the seed. That has
been declared in the Bhavishyatpurâ*n*a. <span

7\. Now Pra*g*âpati also says,

8\. 'Those dwell with us who fulfil the following (duties): the study of
the three Vedas, the studentship, the procreation of children, faith,
religious austerities, sacrifices, and the giving of gifts. He who
praises other (duties), becomes dust and perishes.' <span
id="fr_748"></span>[8](#fn_747.md)

9\. Those among these (sons) who commit sin, perish alone, just as the
leaf of a tree (which has been attacked by worms falls without injuring
its branch or tree). They do not hurt their ancestors.

10\. (For) the (ancestor) has no connection with the acts committed (by
his descendant) in this world, nor with their results in the next.

11\. (The truth of) that may be known by the following (reason):

12\. This creation (is the work) of Pra*g*âpati and of the sages.

13\. The bodies of those (sages) who stay there (in heaven) on account
of their merits appear visibly most excellent and brilliant (as, for
instance, the constellation of the seven *Ri*shis). <span
id="fr_749"></span>[13](#fn_748.md)

14\. But even though some (ascetic), whilst still <span
id="fr_750"></span>[14](#fn_749.md)

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

in the body, may gain heaven through a portion of (the merit acquired by
his former) works or through austerities, and though he may. accomplish
(his objects) by his mere wish, still this is no reason to place one
order before the other.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_746"></span>[160:6](sbe0259.htm#fr_747.md) **24**. 'They
become the seed,' i.e. 'The Pra*g*âpatis.'

<span id="fn_747"></span>[160:8](sbe0259.htm#fr_748) 'Other (duties.md),
i.e. the order of ascetics and the like.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[160:13](sbe0259.htm#fr_749.md) As the *Ri*shis
have not lost heaven through the sins of their sons, the dogma according
to which ancestors lose heaven through the sins of their sons, must be
false.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[160:14](sbe0259.htm#fr_750.md) Âpastamba's own
opinion is apparently against pure asceticism.
