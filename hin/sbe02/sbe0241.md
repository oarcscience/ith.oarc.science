### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 3, KHA*ND*A 6.

1\. If he has any doubts regarding the caste and conduct of a person who
has come to him in order to fulfil his duty (of learning the Veda), he
shall kindle a fire (with the ceremonies prescribed for kindling the
sacrificial fire) and ask him about his caste and conduct. <span
id="fr_582"></span>[1](#fn_581)

2\. If he declares himself to be (of) good (family and conduct, the
teacher elect) shall say, 'Agni who sees, Vâyu who hears, Âditya who
brings to light, vouch for his goodness; may it be well with this
person! He is free from sin.' Then he shall begin to teach him.

3\. A guest comes to the house resembling a burning fire. <span
id="fr_583"></span>[3](#fn_582)

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

4\. He is called a *S*rotriya who, observing the law (of studentship),
has learned one recension of the Veda (which may be current in his
family). <span id="fr_584"></span>[4](#fn_583)

5\. He is called a guest (who, being a *S*rotriya), approaches solely
for the fulfilment of his religious duties, and with no other object, a
householder who lives intent on the fulfilment of his duties. <span
id="fr_585"></span>[5](#fn_584)

6\. The reward for honouring (such a guest) is immunity from
misfortunes, and heavenly bliss. <span id="fr_586"></span>[6](#fn_585)

7\. He shall go to meet such (a guest), honour him according to his age
(by the formulas of salutation prescribed), and cause a seat to be given
to him.

8\. Some declare that, if possible, the seat should have many
feet. <span id="fr_587"></span>[8](#fn_586)

9\. The (householder himself) shall wash the feet of that (guest);
according to some, two *S*ûdras shall do it.

10\. One of them shall be employed in pouring water (over the guest, the
other in washing his feet).

11\. Some declare that the water for the (guest) shall be brought in an
earthen vessel. <span id="fr_588"></span>[11](#fn_587)

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

12\. But (a guest) who has not yet returned home from his teacher shall
not be a cause for fetching water. <span
id="fr_589"></span>[12](#fn_588)

13\. In case a (student comes, the host) shall repeat the Veda (together
with him) for a longer time (than with other guests).

14\. He shall converse kindly (with his guest), and gladden him with
milk or other (drinks), with eatables, or at least with water.

15\. He shall offer to his guest a room, a bed, a mattress, a pillow
with a cover, and ointment, and what else (may be necessary). <span
id="fr_590"></span>[15](#fn_589)

16\. (If the dinner has been finished before the arrival of the guest),
he shall call his cook and give him rice or yava for (preparing a fresh
meal for) the guest. <span id="fr_591"></span>[16](#fn_590)

17\. (If dinner is ready at the arrival of the guest), he himself shall
portion out the food and look at it, saying (to himself), 'Is this
(portion) greater, or this?'

18\. He shall say, 'Take out a larger (portion for the guest).'

19\. A guest who is at enmity (with his host) shall not eat his food,
nor (shall he eat the food of a host) who hates him or accuses him of a
crime, or of one who is suspected of a crime. <span
id="fr_592"></span>[19](#fn_591)

20\. For it is declared in the Veda that he (who eats the food of such a
person) eats his guilt.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_581"></span>[114:1](sbe0241.htm#fr_582) **6**. The person
desirous to study addresses his teacher elect with the following Mantra:
Bhagavan maitre*n*a *k*akshushâ pa*s*ya *s*ivena manasânug*ri*hâ*n*a
prasîda mâm adhyâpaya, 'venerable Sir, look on me with a friendly eye,
receive me with a favourable mind, be kind and teach me.' The teacher
elect then asks: Ki*m*gotro ’si saumya, kimâ*k*âra*h*, 'friend, of what
family art thou? what is thy rule of conduct?'

<span id="fn_582"></span>[114:3](sbe0241.htm#fr_583) The object of this
Sûtra is to show the absolute necessity of feeding a guest. For, if
offended, he might burn the house with the flames of his anger.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[115:4](sbe0241.htm#fr_584) The object of this
Sûtra is to complete the definition of the term 'guest' to be given in
the following Sûtra. In my translation I have followed Haradatta's
gloss. The literal sense of Âpastamba's words is,. 'He who, observing
the law, has studied one recension of each (of the four) Vedas, becomes
a *S*rotriya.' Haradatta says this definition would be contrary to the
current acceptation of the term. That argument proves, however, nothing
for Âpastamba's times.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[115:5](sbe0241.htm#fr_585) Manu III, 102, 103;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 111.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[115:6](sbe0241.htm#fr_586) Yâ*gñ*. I, 109;
Manu III, 101.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[115:8](sbe0241.htm#fr_587) Haradatta states
that this is also Âpastamba's opinion.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[115:11](sbe0241.htm#fr_588) According to
Haradatta, Âpastamba is of opinion that it should be brought in a pot
made of metal.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[116:12](sbe0241.htm#fr_589) I.e. it is
unnecessary to offer water for washing the feet to a student.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[116:15](sbe0241.htm#fr_590) 'Ointment, (i.e.)
oil or clarified butter for anointing the feet.'--Haradatta. Manu III,
107.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[116:16](sbe0241.htm#fr_591) Manu III, 108.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[116:19](sbe0241.htm#fr_592) Manu IV, 213;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 162.
