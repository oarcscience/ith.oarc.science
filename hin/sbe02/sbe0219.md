### Footnotes

<span id="fn_357"></span>[57:1](sbe0219.htm#fr_358) **16**. Haradatta
takes â*k*am here to mean 'to drink water,' and thinks that it is
forbidden to do this standing or in a bent position. Others refer the
prohibition to 'sipping water for the sake of purification,' and
translate, 'He shall not sip water standing or in a bent position
(except in case of necessity),' i.e. if the bank of the river is so high
that he cannot reach the water sitting down, and in this case he shall
enter it up to his thighs or up to his navel.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[57:2](sbe0219.htm#fr_359) Manu II, 60 and 62;
V, 139; and Yâ*gñ*. I, 20 and 27; Weber. Ind. Stud. X, 165. Haradatta
observes, that the further particulars regarding purification by sipping
water must be supplied from other Sm*ri*tis. The rule quoted by him is
as follows: 'The performer should be sitting in a pure place, not on a
seat, except when sipping water after dinner, and should sip thrice from
his hand water which is free from bubbles and foam, and which he has
attentively regarded, in such a quantity as would cover a Mâsha-bean.
<span id="page_58">p. 58</span> The water sipped by a Brahman should
reach his heart, that sipped by a Kshatriya the throat, and that sipped
by a Vai*s*ya the palate. A *S*ûdra sips once as much as to wet his
tongue.'

<span id="fn_359"></span>[58:7](sbe0219.htm#fr_360) The eyes are to be
touched with the thumb and the fourth finger, either at once, or one
after the other, the nostrils with the thumb and the second finger, the
ears with the thumb and the small finger.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[58:9](sbe0219.htm#fr_361) Manu V, 138.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[58:11](sbe0219.htm#fr_362) Haradatta observes
that this Sûtra shows, that every other foreign substance brought with
the food into the mouth, makes the food 'leavings' and the eater impure.
Manu V, 141.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[58:12](sbe0219.htm#fr_363) Manu V, 141
declares sipping to be unnecessary in this case.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[59:14](sbe0219.htm#fr_364) Manu V, 145.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[59:18](sbe0219.htm#fr_365) The term "ten days"
is used in order to indicate the time of impurity generally. In some
cases, as that of a Kshatriya, this lasts longer. In other cases, where
the impurity lasts thirty-six hours only, (the abstention from dining in
such houses is shorter.)'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 217.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[59:19](sbe0219.htm#fr_366) A lying-in woman is
impure, and must not be touched during the first ten days after her
confinement. During this time, she exclusively occupies the
Sûtikâg*ri*ha, or lying-in chamber. Manu IV, 217.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[59:20](sbe0219.htm#fr_367) Haradatta remarks
that in the case of the death of a person who is not a relation, it is
customary to place at the distance of 'one hundred bows' a lamp and
water-vessel, and to eat (beyond that distance).

<span id="fn_367"></span>[60:21](sbe0219.htm#fr_368) 'Food which is
simply impure, may be purified by putting it on the fire, sprinkling it
with water, touching it with ashes or earth, and praising
it.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[60:22](sbe0219.htm#fr_369) Others say, that
the food becomes unfit for eating, only, if in bringing it, the *S*ûdra
has touched it.--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[60:23](sbe0219.htm#fr_370) Manu IV, 207;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 167. 'But this rule holds good only if the hair had been
cooked with the food. If a hair falls into it at dinner, then it is to
be purified by an addition of clarified butter, and may be
eaten.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[60:24](sbe0219.htm#fr_371) Haradatta quotes a
passage from Baudhâyana, which enumerates as 'unclean things' here
intended, 'hair, worms or beetles, nail-parings, excrements of rats.'
The rule must be understood as the preceding, i.e. in case these things
have been cooked with the food.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[60:26](sbe0219.htm#fr_372) Manu IV, 207:
Yâ*gñ*. I, 167, 168. This Sûtra must be read with Sûtra 23 above.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[60:30](sbe0219.htm#fr_373) Manu IV, 208;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 167. Apapâtras are persons whom one must not allow to eat
from one's dishes, e.g. *K*a*nd*âlas, Patitas, a woman in her courses or
during the ten days of impurity after confinement. See also above, I, 1,
3, 25.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[61:32](sbe0219.htm#fr_374) Haradatta thinks,
that as the Sûtra has the feminine gender, dâsî, it does not matter if a
male slave brings the food. But others forbid also this.
