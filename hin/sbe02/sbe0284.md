### CHAPTER XX.

1\. Let him cast off a father who assassinates a king, who sacrifices
for *S*ûdras, who sacrifices for <span id="fr_1369"></span>[1](#fn_1368.md)

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

his own sake (accepting) money from *S*ûdras, who divulges the Veda (to
persons not authorised to study it), who kills a learned Brâhma*n*a, who
dwells with men of the lowest castes, or (cohabits) with a female of one
of the lowest castes.

2\. Having assembled the (sinner's) spiritual Gurus and the relatives by
marriage, (the sons and other kinsmen) shall perform (for him) all the
funeral rites, the first of which is the libation of water, <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[2](#fn_1369.md)

3\. And (afterwards) they shall overturn his water-vessel (in the
following manner):

4\. A slave or a hired servant shall fetch an impure vessel from a
dust-heap, fill it (with water taken) from the pot of a female slave
and, his face turned towards the south upset it with his foot,
pronouncing (the sinner's) name (and saying): 'I deprive N. N. of
water.'

5\. All (the kinsmen) shall touch him (the slave) passing their
sacrificial cords over the right shoulder and under the left arm, and
untying the locks on their heads.

6\. The spiritual Gurus and the relatives by marriage shall look on.

7\. Having bathed, they (all shall) enter the village.

8\. He who afterwards unintentionally speaks to <span
id="fr_1371"></span>[8](#fn_1370.md)

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

the (outcast sinner) shall stand. during one night, reciting the
Sâvitrî.

9\. If he intentionally (converses with the outcast, he must perform the
same penance) for three nights.

10\. But if an (outcast sinner) is purified by (performing) a penance,
(his kinsmen) shall, after he has become pure, fill a golden vessel
(with water) from a very holy lake or a river, and make him bathe in
water (taken) from that (vessel). <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[10](#fn_1371.md)

11\. Then they shall give him that vessel and he, after taking it, shall
mutter (the following Mantras): 'Cleansed is the sky, cleansed is the
earth, cleansed and auspicious is the middle sphere; I here take that
which is brilliant.' <span id="fr_1373"></span>[11](#fn_1372.md)

12\. Let him offer clarified butter, (reciting) these Ya*g*us formulas,
the Pâvamânîs, the Taratsamandîs, and the Kûshmâ*nd*as.

13\. Let him present gold or a cow to a Brâhma*n*a,

14\. And to his teacher.

15\. But he, whose penance lasts for his (whole) lifetime, will be
purified after death. <span id="fr_1374"></span>[15](#fn_1373.md)

16\. Let (his kinsmen) perform for him all the funeral rites, the first
of which is the libation of water.

17\. This same (ceremony of bathing in) water <span
id="fr_1375"></span>[17](#fn_1374.md)

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

consecrated for the sake of purification (must be performed) in the case
of all minor offences (upapâtakas).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1368"></span>[277:1](sbe0284.htm#fr_1369.md) **XX**. Haradatta
remarks that the father is mentioned here, in order to indicate that
other less venerable relatives must certainly <span id="page_278">p.
278</span> also be abandoned. He also states that bhrû*n*ahan, 'he who
slays a learned Brâhma*n*a,' includes sinners who have committed other
mortal sins (mahâpâtaka), see XXI, 1.

<span id="fn_1369"></span>[278:2](sbe0284.htm#fr_1370.md) Manu XI, 183-185;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 295. The spiritual Gurus, i.e. the teacher who
initiated him (â*k*ârya) and those who instructed him in the Veda
(upâdhyâya).

<span id="fn_1370"></span>[278:8](sbe0284.htm#fr_1371.md) Manu XI, 185.

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[279:10](sbe0284.htm#fr_1372.md) Manu XI,
187-188; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 296.

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[279:11](sbe0284.htm#fr_1373.md) As appears from
Gobhila G*ri*hya-sûtra III, 4, 16, the noun to be understood is apâm
a*ñg*ali*h*, 'a handful of water.'

<span id="fn_1373"></span>[279:15](sbe0284.htm#fr_1374.md) Haradatta refers
the term Pâvamânîs here to Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a I, 4, 8. The
Taratsamandîs are found Rig veda IX, 58.

<span id="fn_1374"></span>[279:17](sbe0284.htm#fr_1375.md) '"Water
(consecrated) for the sake of purification" means <span id="page_280">p.
280</span> water consecrated by the formulas, "Cleansed is the earth,"
&c.'--Haradatta.
