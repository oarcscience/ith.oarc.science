### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 5, KHA*ND*A 11.

1\. In the cases of (men of) other castes, the king, after having
examined their actions, may punish them even by death.

2\. And the king shall not punish on suspicion.

3\. But having carefully investigated (the case) by means of questions
(addressed to witnesses) and even of ordeals, the king may proceed to
punish. <span id="fr_623"></span>[3](#fn_622.md)

4\. A king who acts thus, gains both (this and the next) world.

5\. The road belongs to the king except if he meets a Brâhma*n*a. <span
id="fr_624"></span>[5](#fn_623.md)

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

6\. But if he meets a Brâhma*n*a, the road belongs to the latter. <span
id="fr_625"></span>[6](#fn_624.md)

7\. All must make way for a (laden) vehicle, for a person who carries a
burden, for a sick man, for a woman and others (such as old men and
infants).

8\. And (way must be made), by the other castes, for those men who are
superior by caste.

9\. For their own welfare all men must make way for fools, outcasts,
drunkards, and madmen.

10\. In successive births men of the lower castes are born in the next
higher one, if they have fulfilled their duties. <span

11\. In successive births men of the higher castes are born in the next
lower one, if they neglect their duties.

12\. If he has a wife who (is willing and able) to perform (her share
of) the religious duties and who bears sons, he shall not take a
second. <span id="fr_627"></span>[12](#fn_626.md)

13\. If a wife is deficient in one of these two (qualities), he shall
take another, (but) before he kindles the fires (of the
Agnihotra). <span id="fr_628"></span>[13](#fn_627.md)

14\. For a wife who assists at the kindling of the fires, becomes
connected with those religious rites of which that (fire-kindling) forms
a part. <span id="fr_629"></span>[14](#fn_628.md)

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

17\. At the wedding called Brâhma, he shall give away (his daughter) for
bearing children and performing the rites that must be performed
together (by a husband and his wife), after having enquired regarding
(the bridegroom's) family, character, learning, and health, and after
having given (to the bride) ornaments according to his power. <span
id="fr_632"></span>[17](#fn_631.md)

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

<span id="fn_623"></span>[125:5](sbe0246.htm#fr_624.md) Manu II, 139;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 117. According to Haradatta this Sûtra is given, though the
precedence among the various castes has been already settled, in order
to show that common Kshatriyas must make way for an anointed king.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[126:6](sbe0246.htm#fr_625.md) Manu II, 138;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 117.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[126:10](sbe0246.htm#fr_626.md) Manu X, 64, 65;
Yâ*gñ*. 1, 96.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[126:12](sbe0246.htm#fr_627.md) Manu IX, 95;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 76.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[126:13](sbe0246.htm#fr_628.md) Manu IX, 80, 81;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 73.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[126:14](sbe0246.htm#fr_629.md) A wife who assists
at the kindling of the fires for any sacrificial rite, becomes connected
with that rite like any priest, and in that rite no other woman can take
her place. Hence in the case of an Agnihotra, which lasts during the
performer's lifetime, or at least as long as be is a householder, the
performer cannot take another principal wife after be once has begun his
sacrifice. If the wife of an Agnihotrin dies, he must marry again, and
also kindle his fires afresh. Manu V, 167, 168; Yâ*gñ*. I 80.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[127:15](sbe0246.htm#fr_630.md) The term Gotra
corresponds to the Latin Gens. It may be of two kinds, Vaidika for
Brâhma*n*as and Laukika, 'worldly', for men of other castes. In the
first case it denotes 'persons descended from the same *Ri*shi;' in the
second, 'persons distinguished by the same family name, or known to be
descended from the same ancestor.' In our days Brâhma*n*as also have
Laukika Gotras, which form subdivisions of the very large Vedic Gotras.
Regarding the Vaidika Gotras, see Max Müller's History of Ancient
Sanskrit Literature, pp. 379-390, and particularly p. 387. Manu III, 5;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 33; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 75 seq.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[127:16](sbe0246.htm#fr_631.md) The term
yonisambandha, 'related (within six degrees),' corresponds to the more
common Sapi*nd*a of Manu, Yâ*gñ*avalkya, and others; see the definitions
given below, II, 6, 15, 2. In Âpastamba's terminology Sapi*nd*a has
probably a more restricted sense. It seems very doubtful whether
Haradatta's explanation of ka, translated by 'or,' is correct, and
whether his interpolation of 'the father's' ought to be admitted.
Probably Sûtra 15 refers to the father's side, and Sûtra 16 to the
mother's side.
