### CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. A secret penance (must be performed) by him whose sin is not
publicly known. <span id="fr_1443"></span>[1](#fn_1442.md)

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

2\. He who desires to accept or has accepted (a gift) which ought not to
be accepted, shall recite the four *Ri*k-verses (IX, 58, 1-4),
(beginning) Tarat sa mandî, (standing) in water. <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[2](#fn_1443.md)

3\. He who desires to eat forbidden food, shall scatter earth (on
it). <span id="fr_1445"></span>[3](#fn_1444.md)

4\. Some (declare, that) he who has connection with a woman during her
courses becomes pure by bathing. <span id="fr_1446"></span>[4](#fn_1445.md)

5\. Some (declare, that this rule holds good) in the case of (one's own)
wives (only). <span id="fr_1447"></span>[5](#fn_1446.md)

6\. The (secret) penance for killing a learned Brâhma*n*a (is as
follows):, Living during ten days on milk (alone) or (on food fit for
offerings), during a second (period of ten days) on clarified butter,
and during a third (period of ten days) on water, partaking <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[6](#fn_1447.md)

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

of (such food) once only each day, in the morning, and keeping his
garments constantly wet, he shall (daily) offer (eight) oblations,
(representing) the hair, the nails, the skin, the flesh, the blood, the
sinews, the bones, (and) the marrow. The end of each (Mantra) shall be,
'I offer in the mouth of the Atman (the Self), in the jaws of Death.'

7\. Now another (penance for the murder of a Brâhma*n*a will be
described):

8\. The rule (as to eating and so forth), which has been declared
(above, Sûtra 6, must be observed),

9\. (And) he shall offer clarified butter, reciting (the sacred text
Rig-veda I, 189, 2), 'O fire, do thou ferry over,' the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis,
and the Kûshmâ*nd*as; <span id="fr_1449"></span>[9](#fn_1448.md)

10\. Or, for the murder of a Brâhma*n*a, for drinking spirituous liquor,
for stealing (gold), and for the violation of a Guru's bed, he may
perform that (same vow), tire himself by repeatedly stopping his breath,
and recite (the hymn seen by) Aghamarsha*n*a. That is equal (in
efficacy) to the final bath at a horse-sacrifice; <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[10](#fn_1449.md)

11\. Or, repeating the Gâyatrî a thousand times, he, forsooth, purifies
himself; <span id="fr_1451"></span>[11](#fn_1450.md)

12\. Or, thrice repeating (the hymn of) Aghamarsha*n*a while immersed in
water, he is freed from all sins.

XI, 248; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 301.

<span id="fn_1443"></span>[292:2](sbe0288.htm#fr_1444.md) Manu XI, 254. 'He
who has accepted or desires to accept, i.e. because no other course is
possible, (a present) offered by a man that is blamable on account of
the caste of the giver or on account of his deeds, or (a present) that
in itself is blamable, e.g. the skin of a black-buck and the like . . .
in water, i.e. according to some, standing in water that reaches to his
navel according to others, entirely immersed in water.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1444"></span>[292:3](sbe0288.htm#fr_1445.md) Manu loc. cit.
'Forbidden food has been described above, XVII, 8, 9. If, being unable
to act otherwise, he desires to eat that, he shall throw earth, i.e. a
piece of earth, (into it) and then eat it.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1445"></span>[292:4](sbe0288.htm#fr_1446.md) Haradatta adds
that he shall bathe, dressed in his garments.

<span id="fn_1446"></span>[292:5](sbe0288.htm#fr_1447.md) Haradatta adds
that another commentator reads ekestrîshu, i.e. eke astrîshu, and
explains the Sûtra to mean, 'Some (declare the above rule to refer also)
to a bestial crime.'

<span id="fn_1447"></span>[292:6](sbe0288.htm#fr_1448.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya
III, 303. According to Haradatta the complete Mantras are as follows:
Lomânyâtmano mukhe m*ri*tyorâsye *g*uhomi svâhâ, nakhânyâ. m. m. â.
*g*uhomi svâhâ, &c. This secret penance is apparently a milder form of
that prescribed Âpastamba I, 9, 25, 12.

<span id="fn_1448"></span>[293:9](sbe0288.htm#fr_1449.md) The
Mahâvyâh*ri*tis are, bhû*h*, bhuva*h*, sva*h*. Regarding the
Kûshmâ*nd*as, see above, XIX, 12.

<span id="fn_1449"></span>[293:10](sbe0288.htm#fr_1450.md) Manu XI,
260-261; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 302. The vow intended is that prescribed
above, Sûtras 6, 8.

<span id="fn_1450"></span>[293:11](sbe0288.htm#fr_1451.md) Âpastamba I, 9,
26, 14-I, 9, 27, 1. Haradatta remarks that the performer of the penance
shall live on milk and stop his breath, repeatedly stopping his breath.
