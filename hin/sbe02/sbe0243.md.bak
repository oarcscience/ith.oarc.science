### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 4, KHA*ND*A 8.

1\. On the second and following days of the guest's stay, the host shall
not rise or descend (from his couch) in order to salute his (guest), if
he has been saluted before (on the first day).

2\. He shall eat after his guests. <span id="fr_604"></span>[2](#fn_603.md)

3\. He shall not consume all the flavoured liquids in the house, so as
to leave nothing for guests. <span id="fr_605"></span>[3](#fn_604.md)

4\. He shall not cause sweetmeats to be prepared for his own sake. <span
id="fr_606"></span>[4](#fn_605.md)

5\. (A guest) who can repeat the (whole) Veda (together with the
supplementary books) is worthy to receive a cow and the
Madhuparka, <span id="fr_607"></span>[5](#fn_606.md)

6\. (And also) the teacher, an officiating priest, a Snâtaka, and a just
king (though not learned in the Veda).

7\. A cow and the Madhuparka (shall be offered) to the teacher, to an
officiating priest, to a father-in-law, and to a king, if they come
after a year has elapsed (since their former visit).

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

8\. The Madhuparka shall consist of curds mixed with honey, or of milk
mixed with honey. <span id="fr_608"></span>[8](#fn_607.md)

9\. On failure (of these substances) water (mixed with honey may be
used).

10\. The Veda has six Aṅgas (auxiliary works). <span
id="fr_609"></span>[10](#fn_608.md)

11\. (The six auxiliary works are) the Kalpa (teaching the ritual) of
the Veda, the treatises on grammar, astronomy, etymology, phonetics, and
metrics.

12\. (If any one should contend that) the term Veda (on account of its
etymology, implying that which teaches duty or whereby one obtains
spiritual merit) applies to the complete collection of (works which
contain) rules for rites to be performed on the authority of precepts,
(that, consequently, the Kalpa-sûtras form part of the Veda, and that
thereby) the number (fixed above) for those (Aṅgas) is proved to be
wrong, <span id="fr_610"></span>[12](#fn_609.md)

13\. (Then we answer), All those who are learned in Mîmâ*m*sâ are agreed
that (the terms Veda, Brâhma*n*a, and the like, which are applied to)
the principal (works), do not include the Aṅgas (the Kalpa-sûtras and
the rest). he remembers at any time during dinner,

14\. If he remembers at any time that he has refused a guest, he shall
at once leave off eating and fast on that day,
