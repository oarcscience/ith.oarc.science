### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 2, KHA*ND*A 5.

1\. On the day on which, beginning the study of the whole sacred
science, the Upanishads (and the rest, he performs the Upâkarma in the
morning) he shall not study (at night). <span
id="fr_573"></span>[1](#fn_572.md)

2\. And he shall not leave his teacher at once after having studied (the
Veda and having returned home) <span id="fr_574"></span>[2](#fn_573.md)

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

3\. If he is in a hurry to go, he shall perform the daily recitation of
the Veda in the presence of his teacher, and then go at his pleasure. In
this manner good fortune will attend both of them.

4\. If the (former) teacher visits him after he has returned home, he
shall go out to meet him, embrace his (feet), and he shall not wash
himself (after that act), showing disgust. He then shall let him pass
first into the house, fetch (the materials necessary for a hospitable
reception), and honour him according to the rule. <span
id="fr_575"></span>[4](#fn_574.md)

5\. If his former teacher is) present, he himself shall use a seat, a
bed, food, and garments inferior to, and lower (than those offered to
the teacher.

6\. Standing (with his body bent), he shall place his left hand (under
the water-vessel, and bending with his other hand its mouth downwards),
he shall offer to his teacher water for sipping. <span
id="fr_576"></span>[6](#fn_575.md)

7\. And (he shall offer water for sipping in this manner) to other
guests also who possess all (good qualities) together. <span
id="fr_577"></span>[7](#fn_576.md)

8\. He shall imitate (his teacher) in rising, sitting, walking, about,
and smiling. <span id="fr_578"></span>[8](#fn_577.md)

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

9\. In the presence (of his teacher) he shall not void excrements,
discharge wind, speak aloud, laugh, spit, clean his teeth, blow his
nose, frown, clap his hands, nor snap his fingers.

10\. Nor shall he tenderly embrace or address caressing words to his
wife or children.

11\. He shall not contradict his teacher,

12\. Nor any of his betters.

13\. (He shall not) blame or revile any creature. <span
id="fr_579"></span>[13](#fn_578.md)

14\. (He shall not revile one branch of) sacred learning by (invidiously
comparing it with) another. <span id="fr_580"></span>[14](#fn_579.md)

15\. If he is not well versed in a (branch of) sacred learning (which he
studied formerly), he shall again go to the (same) teacher and master
it, observing the (same) rules as (during his first studentship).

16\. The restrictions (to be kept) by the teacher from the beginning of
the course of teaching to its end are, to avoid cutting the hair on the
body, partaking of meat or of oblations to the Manes, and connection
(with a woman). <span id="fr_581"></span>[16](#fn_580.md)

17\. Or (he may have conjugal intercourse) with his wife at the proper
season.

18\. He shall be attentive in instructing his pupils in the sacred
learning, in such a manner that they

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

master it, and in observing the restrictions (imposed upon householders
during their teaching . He who acts thus, gains heavenly bliss for
himself, his descendants and ancestors.

19\. He who entirely avoids with mind, word, nose, eye, and ear the
sensual objects (such as are) enjoyed by the touch, the organ, or the
stomach, gains immortality.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_572"></span>[111:1](sbe0240.htm#fr_573.md) **5**. This rule
refers to the Upâkarma, to be performed yearly by householders. In our
days, too, the custom is observed, and the whole Brahminical community
change on this occasion their *G*envîs or sacrificial cords in the month
of Srâva*n*a. The adherents of the various *S*âkhâs of the Vedas,
however, perform the ceremony on different days. According to Haradatta,
the Upanishads are named, in order to show that they are of the highest
importance. See also *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a X, 3, 5, 12.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[111:2](sbe0240.htm#fr_574.md) Others consider
that this Sûtra refers to the annual Upâkarma of the householder. In
that case the translation would be, 'And after having performed the
Upâkarma,' &c. Probably Âpastamba means to give a general rule,
applicable both to householders and to students who have returned home.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[112:4](sbe0240.htm#fr_575.md) 'Though he may
suspect that the teacher had been defiled by the touch of a *K*â*nd*âla
or the like, still he shall not show disgust nor wash
himself.'--Haradatta. Regarding the rule of receiving guests, see below,
II, 4, 8, 6 seq.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[112:6](sbe0240.htm#fr_576.md) According to
Haradatta, the repetition of the word â*k*âryam, 'the teacher,' in this
Sûtra, indicates that the rule holds good not only when the teacher
comes as a guest to his former pupil, but on every occasion when he
receives water for sipping.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[112:7](sbe0240.htm#fr_577.md) 'He is called
samudeta, "possessed of all (good qualities) together," who is endowed
with (good) birth, disposition, behaviour, (great) learning, and a
(venerable) age.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[112:8](sbe0240.htm#fr_578.md) The word syât is to
be understood from Sûtra 5.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[113:13](sbe0240.htm#fr_579.md) Haradatta states
that 'speaking evil' is forbidden here once more in order that it should
be particularly avoided.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[113:14](sbe0240.htm#fr_580.md) 'For example, he
shall not say, "The [*Rig*-veda](errata.htm#0.md) is sweet to the ear, the
other Vedas grate on the ear," or "the Taittirîya-veda is a *S*âkhâ
consisting of leavings," or "the Brâhma*n*a proclaimed by Yâ*gñ*avalkya
is of modern origin."'--Haradatta. The second sentence refers to the
story that Yâ*gñ*avalkya vomited the Black Ya*g*ur-veda, and his
fellow-students, becoming partridges, picked it up. Regarding the third
sentence, see Vârttika on Pâ*n*ini IV, 3, 105, and Max Müller's History
of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, P. 363.
