### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 4, KHA*ND*A 9.

1\. And on the following day (he shall search for him), feast him to his
heart's content, and accompany him (on his departure). <span
id="fr_611"></span>[1](#fn_610.md)

2\. (If the guest) possesses a carriage, (he shall accompany him) as far
as that.

3\. Any other (guest he must accompany), until permission to return is
given.

4\. If (the guest) forgets (to give leave to depart), the (host) may
return on reaching the boundary of his village.

5\. To all (those who come for food) at (the end of) the Vai*s*vadeva he
shall give a portion, even to dogs and *K*a*nd*âlas.

6\. Some declare that he shall not give anything to unworthy people
(such as *K*a*nd*âlas).

7\. A person who has been initiated shall not eat the leavings of women
or of an uninitiated person. <span id="fr_612"></span>[7](#fn_611.md)

8\. All gifts are to be preceded by (pouring out) water. <span
id="fr_613"></span>[8](#fn_612.md)

9\. (But gifts offered to priests) at sacrifices (are to be given) in
the manner prescribed by the Veda.

10\. The division of the food must be made in such a manner that those
who receive daily portions (slaves) do not suffer by it.

11\. At his pleasure, he may stint himself, his wife, or his children,
but by no means a slave who does his work.

12\. And he must not stint himself so much that he becomes unable to
perform his duties.

13\. Now they quote also (the following two verses):

'Eight mouthfuls are the meal of an ascetic, sixteen that of a hermit
living in the woods, thirty-two that of a householder, and an unlimited
quantity that of a student. An Agnihotrin, a draught-ox, and a student,
those three can do their work only if they eat; without eating (much),
they cannot do it.' <span id="fr_614"></span>[13](#fn_613.md)

<span id="fn_610"></span>[122:1](sbe0244.htm#fr_611.md) **9**. Yâ*gñ*. I,
113.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[122:7](sbe0244.htm#fr_612.md) After a long
discussion on the object of this Sûtra, Haradatta comes to the
conclusion that it is given 'against the improper custom to dine out of
the same vessel with one's wife and uninitiated children, which prevails
in some countries.'

<span id="fn_612"></span>[122:8](sbe0244.htm#fr_613.md) 'Consequently a
gift of food also.' The custom is to pour water, usually with the spoon
called Darvî (Pallî), into the extended palm of the recipient's right
hand.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[123:13](sbe0244.htm#fr_614.md) Manu VI, 28;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 55.
