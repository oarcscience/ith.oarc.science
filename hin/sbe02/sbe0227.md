### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 9, KHA*ND*A 24.

1\. He who has killed a Kshatriya shall give a thousand cows (to
Brâhma*n*as) for the expiation of his sin. <span
id="fr_454"></span>[1](#fn_453.md)

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

2\. (He shall give) a hundred cows for a Vai*s*ya, <span
id="fr_455"></span>[2](#fn_454.md)

3\. Ten for a *S*ûdra, <span id="fr_456"></span>[3](#fn_455.md)

4\. And in every one (of these cases) one bull (must be given) in excess
(of the number of cows) for the sake of expiation.

5\. And if women of the (three castes mentioned have been slain) the
same (composition must be paid).

6\. He who has slain a man belonging to the two (first-mentioned castes)
who has studied the Veda, or had been initiated for the performance of a
Soma-sacrifice, becomes an Abhi*s*asta. <span
id="fr_457"></span>[6](#fn_456.md)

7\. And (he is called an Abhi*s*asta) who has slain a man belonging
merely to the Brâhma*n*a caste (though he has not studied the Veda or
been initiated for a Soma-sacrifice),

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

8\. Likewise he who has destroyed an embryo of a (Brâhma*n*a, even
though its sex be) undistinguishable,

9\. Or a woman (of the Brâhma*n*a caste) during her courses. <span
id="fr_458"></span>[9](#fn_457.md)

10\. (Now follows) the penance for him (who is an Abhi*s*asta).

11\. He (himself) shall erect a hut in the forest, restrain his speech,
carry (on his stick) the skull (of the person slain) like a flag, and
cover the space from his navel to his knees with a quarter of a piece of
hempen cloth. <span id="fr_459"></span>[11](#fn_458.md)

12\. The path for him when he goes to a village, is the space between
the tracks (of the wheels).

13\. And if he sees another (Ârya), he shall step out of the road (to
the distance of two yards).

14\. He shall go to the village, carrying a broken tray of metal of an
inferior quality.

15\. He may go to seven houses only, (crying,) 'Who will give alms to an
Abhi*s*asta?'

16\. That is (the way in which he must gain) his livelihood.

17\. If he does not obtain anything (at the seven houses), he must fast.

18\. And (whilst performing this penance) he must tend cows.

19\. When they leave and enter the village, that is the second occasion
(on which he may enter) the village.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

20\. After having performed (this penance) for twelve years, he must
perform) the ceremony known (by custom), through which he is re-admitted
into the society of the good. <span id="fr_460"></span>[20](#fn_459.md)

21\. Or (after having performed the twelve years' penance), he may build
a hut on the path of robbers, and live there, trying to take from them
the cows of Brâhma*n*as. He is free (from his sin), when thrice he has
been defeated by them, or when he has vanquished them. <span
id="fr_461"></span>[21](#fn_460.md)

22\. Or he is freed (from his sin), if (after the twelve years' penance)
he bathes (with the priests) at the end of a horse-sacrifice. <span
id="fr_462"></span>[22](#fn_461.md)

23\. This very same (penance is ordained) for him who, when his duty and
love of gain come into conflict, chooses the gain. <span
id="fr_463"></span>[23](#fn_462.md)

24\. If he has slain a Guru or a Brâhma*n*a, who has studied the Veda
and finished the ceremonies of a Soma-sacrifice, he shall live according
to this very same rule until his last breath. <span
id="fr_464"></span>[24](#fn_463.md)

25\. He cannot be purified in this life. But his sin is removed (after
death). <span id="fr_465"></span>[25](#fn_464.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_453"></span>[78:1](sbe0227.htm#fr_454.md) **24**. Manu XI,
128; Yâ*gñ*. III, 266. Others explain the phrase vairayâtanârtham, 'for
the expiation of his sin,' thus: 'He, who is <span id="page_79">p.
79</span> slain by anybody, becomes, in dying, an enemy of his slayer
(and thinks), "O that I might slay him in another life," for the removal
of this enmity!'--Haradatta. I am strongly inclined to agree with the
other commentator, and to translate vairayâtanârtham, 'in order to
remove the enmity.' I recognise in this fine a remnant of the law
permitting compositions for murder which was in force in ancient Greece
and among the Teutonic nations. With the explanation adopted by
Haradatta, it is impossible to find a reasonable interpretation for
prâya*sk*ittirtha*h*, Sûtra 4. Haradatta, seduced by the parallel
passage of Manu, takes it to be identical with vairayâtanârtham. I
propose to translate our Sûtra thus: 'He who has killed a Kshatriya
shall give a thousand cows (to the relations of the murdered man) in
order to remove the enmity.' According to Baudhâyana I, 10. 19. 1
(compare Zeitschr. d. D. Morg. Ges., vol. 41, pp. 672-76; Festgruss an
Roth, pp. 44-52), the cows are to be given to the king.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[79:2](sbe0227.htm#fr_455.md) Manu XI, 130.
Yâ*gñ*. III, 267.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[79:3](sbe0227.htm#fr_456.md) Manu XI, 131.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[79:6](sbe0227.htm#fr_457.md) Manu XI, 87.
Abhi*s*asta means literally 'accused, accursed,' and corresponds in
Âpastamba's terminology to the mahâpâtakin of Manu and Yâ*gñ*avalkya,
instead of which latter word Manu uses it occasionally, e.g. II, 185.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[80:9](sbe0227.htm#fr_458.md) 'Others interpret
âtreyî, "during her courses," by "belonging to the race of
Atri."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[80:11](sbe0227.htm#fr_459.md) Others say that he
may carry the skull of any corpse. This Sûtra is to be construed with
Sûtra 14, Sûtras 12 and 13 being inserted parenthetically.--Haradatta.
Manu XI, 72-78; Yâ*gñ*. III, 243.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[81:20](sbe0227.htm#fr_460.md) 'I.e. after having
performed the penance, he shall take grass and offer it to a cow. If the
cow approaches and confidingly eats, then one should know that he has
performed the penance properly not otherwise.'--Haradatta. Manu XI, 195
and 196.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[81:21](sbe0227.htm#fr_461.md) Manu XI, 81.--Thus
Haradatta, better, 'when-thrice he has fought with them,' see the Pet.
Dict. s. v. râdh.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[81:22](sbe0227.htm#fr_462.md) Manu XI, 83; Weber,
Ind. Stud. X, 67.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[81:23](sbe0227.htm#fr_463.md) 'Or the Sûtra may
have reference to unrighteous gain acquired by false testimony and the
like.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[81:24](sbe0227.htm#fr_464.md) 'Guru means "the
father and the rest."--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[81:25](sbe0227.htm#fr_465.md) 'His sin is removed
after death. Hence the meaning is that his sons or other (relations) may
perform the funeral ceremonies and the like. But others think that the
first part of the Sûtra forbids this, and that the meaning of
pratvâpatti*h* (can be <span id="page_82">p. 82</span> purified) is
"connection by being received as a son or other relation."--Haradatta.
