### PRA*S*NA II, Pa*t*ala 5, KHA*ND*A 12.

1\. If the suitor pays money (for his bride) according to his ability,

Âsura-rite. <span id="fr_636"></span>[1](#fn_635.md)

2\. If the (bridegroom and his friends) take away (the bride), after
having overcome (by force) her father (or relations), that is called the
Râkshasa-rite. <span id="fr_637"></span>[2](#fn_636.md)

3\. The first three amongst these (marriage-rites are considered)
praiseworthy; each preceding one better than the one following. <span
id="fr_638"></span>[3](#fn_637.md)

4\. The quality of the offspring is according to the quality of the
marriage-rite. <span id="fr_639"></span>[4](#fn_638.md)

Brâhma*n*a, without having sprinkled it with water.

so.

9\. He shall not carry fire and water at the same time.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

12\. He shall not join his hands on his back.

13\. If the sun sets whilst he sleeps, he shall sit up, fasting and

14\. If the sun rises whilst he is asleep, he shall stand during that
day fasting and silent.

15\. Some declare that he shall restrain his breath until he is tired.

16\. And (he shall restrain his breath until he is tired) if he has had
a bad dream,

17\. Or if he desires to accomplish some object,

18\. Or if he has transgressed some other rule. <span
id="fr_643"></span>[18](#fn_642.md)

19\. (If he is) doubtful (whether) the result (of an action will be good
or evil), he shall not do it.

20\. (He shall follow) the same principle (if he is in doubt whether he
ought) to study or not.

21\. He shall not talk of a doubtful matter as if it were clear. <span

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

one who slept at sunrise, of one who has black nails, or black teeth, of
one who married a younger sister before the elder one was married, of
one who married an elder sister whose younger sister had been married
already, (of a younger brother who has kindled the sacred G*ri*hya-fire
before his elder brother,) of one whose younger brother has kindled the
sacred fire first, (of a younger brother who offers a Soma-sacrifice
before his elder brother,) of an elder brother whose younger brother
offered a Soma-sacrifice first, of an elder brother who marries or
receives his portion of the inheritance after his younger brother, and
of a younger brother who takes a wife or receives his portion of the
inheritance before his elder brother,--penances ordained for crimes
causing impurity, a heavier one for each succeeding case, must be
performed.

23\. Some declare, that after having performed that penance, he shall
remove its cause. <span id="fr_646"></span>[23](#fn_645.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_635"></span>[128:1](sbe0247.htm#fr_636.md) **12**. Manu III,
31; Yâ*gñ*. I, 61. It must be understood that, at this rite, a regular
sale of the bride must take place. If a suitor merely gives presents to
the bride, that is not an Âsura-marriage.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[128:2](sbe0247.htm#fr_637.md) Manu III, 33;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 61. Haradatta points out that the other law-books enumerate
two additional marriage-rites, the Prâ*g*âpatya or Kâya and the
Pai*s*â*k*a. But Vasish*th*a I, 29-35, like Âpastamba, gives six rites
only.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[128:3](sbe0247.htm#fr_638.md) Manu III, 24, 25;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 58-60.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[128:4](sbe0247.htm#fr_639.md) I.e. from
praiseworthy marriages virtuous children are born, and from blamable
marriages bad ones. Manu III, 42.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[129:10](sbe0247.htm#fr_640.md) Another
commentator says, 'He shall not throw (brands taken from) one fire into
another fire.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[129:11](sbe0247.htm#fr_641.md) The Sûtra implies
that under other circumstances he must show this respect to a fire.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[129:13](sbe0247.htm#fr_642.md) Manu II, 220.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[129:18](sbe0247.htm#fr_643.md) Manu XI, 200.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[129:21](sbe0247.htm#fr_644.md) See above, I, 11,
32, 22.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[129:22](sbe0247.htm#fr_645.md) These sinners are,
enumerated in nearly the same order, <span id="page_130">p. 130</span>
Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a III, 2, 8, 11 and 12, and Âp. *S*rauta-sûtra IX,
12, 11. See also Manu XI, 44-49. Regarding the crimes causing impurity,
see above, I, 7, 21, 12-19.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[130:23](sbe0247.htm#fr_646.md) 'Its cause, i.e.
the black nails, &c. According to another Sm*ri*ti, one shall not put
away a wife or extinguish a fire, for the taking or kindling of which
the penance had to be performed.'--Haradatta. But see Vasish*th*a XX, 7
seq.
