### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 8, KHA*ND*A 20.

1\. At every monthly *S*râddha he shall use, in whatever manner he may
be able, one dro*n*a of sesamum. <span id="fr_717"></span>[1](#fn_716)

2\. And he shall feed Brâhma*n*as endowed with all (good qualities), and
they shall not give the fragments (of the food) to a person who does not
possess the same good qualities (as the Brâhma*n*as).

3\. He who desires prosperity shall fast in the half of the year when
the sun goes to the north, under the constellation Tishya, in the first
half of the month, for (a day and) a night at least, prepare a
Sthâlîpâka-offering, offer burnt-oblations to Kubera (the god of
riches), feed a Brâhma*n*a with that (food prepared for the Sthâlîpâka)
mixed with clarified butter, and make him wish prosperity with (a
Mantra) implying prosperity. <span id="fr_718"></span>[3](#fn_717)

4\. This (rite he shall repeat) daily until the next Tishya(-day).

5\. On the second (Tishya-day and during the second month he shall feed)
two (Brâhma*n*as).

6\. On the third (Tishya-day and during the third month he shall feed)
three (Brâhma*n*as).

7\. In this manner (the Tishya-rite is to be performed) for a year, with
a (monthly) increase (of the number of Brâhma*n*as fed).}

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

8\. (Thus) he obtains great prosperity.

9\. But the fasting takes place on the first (Tishya-day) only.

10\. He shall avoid to eat those things which have lost their strength
(as butter-milk, curds, and whey).

11\. He shall avoid to tread on ashes or husks of grain. <span

13\. And to swing his feet,

14\. And to place one leg crosswise over the knee (of the other),

15\. And to make his nails

16\. Or to make (his finger-joints) crack without a (good) reason, <span
id="fr_720"></span>[16](#fn_719)

17\. And all other (acts) which they blame.

18\. And let him acquire money in all ways that are lawful.

19\. And let him spend money on worthy (persons or objects). <span
id="fr_721"></span>[19](#fn_720)

20\. And let him not give anything to an unworthy (person), of whom he
does not stand in fear.

21\. And let him conciliate men (by gifts or kindness).

22\. And he may enjoy the pleasures which are not forbidden by the holy
law.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_716"></span>[151:1](sbe0255.htm#fr_717) **20**. A dro*n*a
equals 128 seers or *s*eras. The latter is variously reckoned at 1-3
lbs.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[151:3](sbe0255.htm#fr_718) The reason why the
constellation Tishya has been chosen for this rite seems to be that
Tishya has another name, Pushya, i.e. 'prosperous'. This sacrifice is to
begin on the Tishya-day of the month called Taisha or Pausha
(December-January), and to continue for one year.

cracking the joints are fatigue or rheumatism.'--Haradatta.

passim.
