<span id="fn_219"></span>[26:11](sbe0210.htm#fr_220.md) Though both (these
first two precepts) have been given in Sûtra I, 1, 2, 27, still they are
repeated, in order to show that a *S*rauta penance for the breach of
them, is enjoined by a revealed text.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[26:12](sbe0210.htm#fr_221.md) The term va*m*sya,
'ancestor,' for the teacher's teacher is explained by the circumstance,
that Hindus consider a 'school,' consisting of a succession of teachers
and pupils, as a spiritual family, and call it a vidyâva*m*sa,
vidyâparamparâ. Manu II, 205.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[26:13](sbe0210.htm#fr_222.md) 'Another
(commentator) says, "He, the pupil, must embrace their feet (at every
meeting) from that time (when he first saw his teacher do it)." Because
the word "but" is used in the Sûtra, he must do so even after he has
returned home (on completion of his studies).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[27:14](sbe0210.htm#fr_223.md) 'More than one
teacher,' i.e. several, who have taught him the several Vedas. Each
Brahman generally knowing one Veda only.

This passage shows, that the young Brahmans in olden time, just as now,
went from one teacher to the other, learning from each what he knew. The
rules, which seemingly enjoin a pupil to stay with one and the same
teacher, refer only to the principle, that the pupil must stay with his
teacher, until he has learnt the subject which he began with him.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[27:18](sbe0210.htm#fr_224.md) 'Religious,
ceremonies, i.e. the wedding and the like. For them he may use it
optionally. He, i.e. on failure of the teacher; the father, on failure
of the father; the mother, on failure of all (the pupil)
himself.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[27:19](sbe0210.htm#fr_225.md) Manu II, 245 and
246; Yâ*gñ*. I, 51; Weber, Ind. Stud, X, 125.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[27:20](sbe0210.htm#fr_226.md) 'The word Ugra
denotes either the offspring of a Vai*s*ya, and of a *S*ûdra woman, or a
twice-born man, who perpetrates dreadful deeds.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[28:24](sbe0210.htm#fr_227.md) Manu II, 119.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[28:26](sbe0210.htm#fr_228.md) See above, I, 1, 1,
13, and note. Here also Haradatta states that the permission to. leave
the teacher is to be restricted to those who have not solemnly bound
themselves to their teacher by allowing him to perform the ceremony of
initiation.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[28:27](sbe0210.htm#fr_229.md) Manu II, 208-212.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[28:28](sbe0210.htm#fr_230.md) 'The use of the
present "adhyâpayati," shows that this rule holds good only for the time
during which he is taught by such a man.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[28:29](sbe0210.htm#fr_231.md) 'Because (an older
fellow-student) is of use to him, according to the verse: One-fourth (of
his learning) a pupil receives from his teacher, one-fourth he acquires
by his own intelligence, one-fourth from his fellow students, one-fourth
he is taught by time.'-- Haradatta.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[28:30](sbe0210.htm#fr_232.md) Manu II, 2,
207-209.
