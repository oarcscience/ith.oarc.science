### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 4, KHA*ND*A 12.

1\. A Brâhma*n*a declares, 'The daily recitation (of the Veda) is
austerity.' <span id="fr_302"></span>[1](#fn_301.md)

2\. In the same (sacred text) it is also declared, Whether he recites
the daily portion of the Veda standing, or sitting, or lying down, he
performs austerity thereby; for the daily recitation is
austerity.' <span id="fr_303"></span>[2](#fn_302.md)

3\. Now the Vâ*g*asaneyi-brâhma*n*a declares also, 'The daily recitation
is a sacrifice at which the Veda is offered. When it thunders, when
lightning flashes or thunderbolts fall, and when the wind blows
violently, these sounds take the place of the exclamations Vasha*t*
(Vausha*t* and Svâhâ). Therefore he shall recite the Veda whilst it
thunders, whilst lightning flashes and thunderbolts fall, and whilst the
wind blows violently, lest the Vasha*t* (should be heard) in vain. <span
id="fr_304"></span>[3](#fn_303.md)

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

4\. The conclusion of the passage from that (Vâ*g*asaneyi-brâhma*n*a is
found) in another *S*âkhâ (of the Veda).

5\. 'Now, if the wind blows, or if it thunders, or if lightning flashes,
or thunderbolts fall, then he shall recite one *Ri*k-verse (in case he
studies the Rig-Veda), or one Ya*g*us (in case he studies the
Ya*g*ur-veda), or one Sâman (in case he studies the Sâma-veda), or
(without having a regard to his particular Veda, the following Ya*g*us),
"Bhû*h* Bhuva*h*, Suva*h*, in faith I offer true devotion." Then,
indeed, his daily recitation is accomplished thereby for that
day.' <span id="fr_305"></span>[5](#fn_304.md)

6\. If that is done, (if the passage of the Vâ*g*asaneyi-brâhma*n*a is
combined with that quoted in Sûtra 5, the former stands) not in
contradiction with the decision of the Âryas. <span
id="fr_306"></span>[6](#fn_305.md)

7\. For they (who know the law) teach both the continuance and the
interruption (of the daily recitation of the Veda). That would be
meaningless, if one paid attention to the (passage of the)
Vâ*g*asaneyi-brâhma*n*a (alone).

8\. For no (worldly) motive for the decision of those Âryas is
perceptible; (and hence it must have a religious motive and be founded
on a passage of the Veda). <span id="fr_307"></span>[8](#fn_306.md)

9\. (The proper interpretation therefore is, that) the prohibition to
study (given above and by the

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

Âryas generally) refers only to the repetition of the sacred texts in
order to learn them, not to their application at sacrifices.

10\. (But if you ask, why the decision of the Âryas presupposes the
existence of a Vedic passage, then I answer): All precepts were
(originally) taught in the Brâhma*n*as, (but) these texts have been
lost. Their (former existence) may, however, be inferred from
usage. <span id="fr_308"></span>[10](#fn_307.md)

11\. But it is not (permissible to infer the former existence of) a
(Vedic) passage in cases where pleasure is obtained (by following a rule
of the Sm*ri*ti or a custom). <span id="fr_309"></span>[11](#fn_308.md)

12\. He who follows such (usages) becomes fit for hell.

13\. Now follow (some rites and) rules that have been declared in the
Brâhma*n*as. <span id="fr_310"></span>[13](#fn_309.md)

14\. By way of laudation they are called 'great sacrifices ' or 'great
sacrificial sessions.' <span id="fr_311"></span>[14](#fn_310.md)

15\. (These rites include): The daily Bali-offering

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

to the (seven classes of) beings; the (daily) gift of (food) to men
according to one's power;

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_301"></span>[45:1](sbe0215.htm#fr_302.md) **12**. 'It procures
as much reward as penance.'--Haradatta. Manu II, 166; Weber, Ind. Stud.
X, 113. The phrase occurs frequently in the Brâhma*n*as, e.g. Taitt. Âr.
II, 14, 3.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[45:2](sbe0215.htm#fr_303.md) Regarding the proper
position at the 'Veda-offering,' or daily recitation, see above, I, 3,
11, 2 3, and Taitt. Âr. II, 11, 3. Passages similar to the first part of
the sentence quoted in this Sûtra occur Taitt. Âr II, 12, 3, and 15, 3.
It ought to be observed that the Taitt. Âr. in both places has the word
'vra*g*an,' which is also read in the P. and P. U. MSS. The second part
is taken apparently from the same work, II, 14, 2.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[45:3](sbe0215.htm#fr_304.md) See
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a XI, 5, 6, 8, where a passage very similar to that
quoted by Âpastamba occurs. Vasha*t* and the other exclamations, which
are pronounced by the Hot*ri*-priest, serve as signals for the Adhvaryu
to throw the oblations into the fire.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[46:5](sbe0215.htm#fr_305.md) 'Some suppose that
the words Bhû*h* Bhuva*h* and Suva*h* &c. (are to be used only) if one
studies the Brâhma*n*a portion of the Veda, not every where.'--
Haradatta.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[46:6](sbe0215.htm#fr_306.md) Haradatta explains
Âryas by vi*s*ish*t*â*h*, 'excellent ones,' i.e. persons who know the
law, and he gives Manu as an instance.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[46:8](sbe0215.htm#fr_307.md) See above, I, 1, 4,
9 and 10. and notes.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[47:10](sbe0215.htm#fr_308.md) How then is their
existence known? 'They are inferred from usage.' '"Usage" means the
teaching of the law-books and the practice. From that it is inferred
that Manu and other (authors of law-books) knew such texts of the
Brâhma*n*as. For how could otherwise (*Ri*shis like Manu) teach in their
works or practise (such customs) for which no authority is now found?
And certainly they were intimately connected with the revealed texts
(i.e. saw them).'-- Haradatta.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[47:11](sbe0215.htm#fr_309.md) Compare above, I,
1, 4, 8-10.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[47:13](sbe0215.htm#fr_310.md) The consequence of
the introduction of these rules into a Sm*ri*ti work is, that their
omission must be expiated by a Smârta penance and not by a *S*rauta one.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[47:14](sbe0215.htm#fr_311.md) The commentator
observes, that, as these rites are called 'great sacrifices,' by way of
laudation only, the particular laws binding on performers of real
Soma-sacrifices cannot be transferred to the performers of these
ceremonies. Regarding the <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> term 'great
sacrifices,' see also Taitt. Âr. II, 11, 10, 1 seq., and
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a XI, 59 6, 1.
