### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 6, KHA*ND*A 15.

1\. By this (discussion) the law of custom, which is observed in
(particular) countries or families, has been disposed of. <span
id="fr_668"></span>[1](#fn_667.md)

2\. On account of the blood relations of his mother and (on account of
those) of his father within six degrees, or, as far as the relationship
is traceable, he shall bathe if they die, excepting children that have
not completed their first year. <span id="fr_669"></span>[2](#fn_668.md)

3\. On account of the death of the latter the parents alone bathe,

4\. And those who bury them. <span id="fr_670"></span>[4](#fn_669.md)

5\. If a wife or one of the chief Gurus (a father or Â*k*ârya) die,
besides, fasting (is ordained from the time at which they die) up to the
same time (on the following day). <span id="fr_671"></span>[5](#fn_670.md)

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

6\. (In that case) they shall also show the (following) signs of
mourning:

7\. Dishevelling their hair and covering themselves with dust (they go
outside the village), and, clothed with one garment, their faces turned
to the south, stepping into the river they throw up water for the dead
once, and then, ascending (the bank), they sit down. <span
id="fr_672"></span>[7](#fn_671.md)

8\. This (they repeat) thrice.

9\. They pour out water consecrated in such a manner that the dead will
know it (to be given to them). Then they return to the village without
looking back, and perform those rites for the dead which (pious) women
declare to be necessary.

10\. Some declare, that these same (observances) shall also be kept in
the case (of the death) of other (Sapi*nd*as).

11\. At all religious ceremonies, he shall feed Brâhma*n*as who are pure
and who have (studied and remember) the Veda. <span
id="fr_673"></span>[11](#fn_672.md)

12\. He shall distribute his gifts at the proper places, at the proper
times, at the occasion of purificatory rites, and to proper
recipients. <span id="fr_674"></span>[12](#fn_673.md)

13\. That food must not be eaten of which (no portion) is offered in the
fire, and of which no portion is first given (to guests).

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

14\. No food mixed with pungent condiments or salt can be offered as a
burnt-offering. <span id="fr_675"></span>[14](#fn_674.md)

15\. Nor (can food) mixed with bad food (be used for a
burnt-oblation). <span id="fr_676"></span>[15](#fn_675.md)

16\. If (he is obliged to offer) a burnt-offering of food unfit for that
purpose, he shall take hot ashes from the northern part of his fire and
offer the food in that. That oblation is no oblation in the fire.

17\. A female shall not offer any burnt-oblation, <span
id="fr_677"></span>[17](#fn_676.md)

18\. Nor a child, that has not been initiated. <span
id="fr_678"></span>[18](#fn_677.md)

19\. Infants do not become impure before they receive the sacrament
called Annaprâ*s*ana (the first feeding).

20\. Some (declare, that they cannot become impure) until they have
completed their first year,

21\. Or, as long as they cannot distinguish the points of the horizon.

22\. The best (opinion is, that they cannot be defiled) until the
initiation has been performed.

23\. For at that (time a child) according to the rules of the Veda
obtains the right (to perform the various religious ceremonies).

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

24\. That ceremony is the limit (from which the capacity to fulfil the
law begins).

25\. And the Sm*ri*ti (agrees with this opinion). <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_667"></span>[137:1](sbe0250.htm#fr_668.md) **15**. Customs are
to be followed only if they are not opposed to the teaching of the Vedas
and Sm*ri*tis.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[137:2](sbe0250.htm#fr_669.md) Manu. V, 60;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 53; Manu V, 60; Manu V, 58; Yâ*gñ*. III, 3.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[137:4](sbe0250.htm#fr_670.md) Manu V, 69 and 70.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[137:5](sbe0250.htm#fr_671.md) Manu V, 80.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[138:7](sbe0250.htm#fr_672.md)-9. Yâ*gñ*. III, 5,
7 seq. The Mantra to be spoken in throwing the water is, 'I give this
water to you N. N. of the family of N. N.' The water ought to be mixed
with sesamum. According to Haradatta those who know the correct
interpretation, declare that the word' women' denotes in this Sûtra 'the
Sm*ri*tis.' But I fear these learned interpreters will find few
adherents among those who pay attention to the last Sûtra of this work.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[138:11](sbe0250.htm#fr_673.md) Manu III, 128.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[138:12](sbe0250.htm#fr_674.md) Manu III, 98.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[139:14](sbe0250.htm#fr_675) 'That (substance.md)
is called kshâra, "of pungent or alkaline taste," the eating of which
makes the saliva flow.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[139:15](sbe0250.htm#fr_676.md) Avarânna, 'bad
food,' is explained by 'kulittha and the like.' Kulittha, a kind of
vetch, is considered low food, and eaten by the lower castes only. The
meaning of the Sûtra, therefore, is, 'If anybody has been forced by
poverty to mix his rice or *D*âl with kulittha or similar bad food, he
cannot offer a burnt-oblation at the Vai*s*vadeva ceremony with that. He
must observe the rule, given in the following Sûtra.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[139:17](sbe0250.htm#fr_677.md) Manu V, 155; XI,
36.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[139:18](sbe0250.htm#fr_678.md) Manu II, 171.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[140:25](sbe0250.htm#fr_679.md) Haradatta quotes
Gautama II, 1-3, on this point, and is apparently of opinion that
Âpastamba alludes to the same passage. But he is probably wrong, as all
Sm*ri*tis are agreed on the point mentioned by Âpastamba.
