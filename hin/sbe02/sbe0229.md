### Footnotes

<span id="fn_476"></span>[84:1](sbe0229.htm#fr_477.md) **26**. 'A reason'
for hurting a cow is, according to Haradatta, anger, or the desire to
obtain meat.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[84:2](sbe0229.htm#fr_478.md) Manu XI, 141;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 269. That 'animals without bones,' i.e. insects or
mollusks, are intended in the Sûtra is an inference, drawn by Haradatta
from the parallel passages of Gautama, Manu, and Yâ*gñ*avalkya.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[84:3](sbe0229.htm#fr_479.md) 'A person who ought
not to be abused, i. e. a father, a teacher, and the like.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[84:5](sbe0229.htm#fr_480.md) The same penances,
i. e. those prescribed I, 9, 24-I, 9, 26, 4. According to Haradatta this
Sûtra is intended to teach that women shall not perform the penances
which follow. Others, however, are of opinion that it is given in order
to indicate that the preceding Sûtras apply to women by an atide*s*a,
and that, according to a Smârta principle, applicable to such cases, it
may be inferred, that women are to perform one-half only of the penances
prescribed for men.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[85:7](sbe0229.htm#fr_481.md) The Anuvâka intended
is Taitt. Sa*m*h. II, 5, 12.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[85:8](sbe0229.htm#fr_482.md) Taitt. Âr. II, 18,
and Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 102; Manu XI, 199 seq.; and Yâ*gñ*. III, 280.
Regarding the Pâkaya*gñ*a-rites, see Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I, 1, 2, and Max
Müller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 203.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[85:12](sbe0229.htm#fr_483.md) Regarding the
Patanîya-crimes which cause loss of caste, see above, I, 7, 21, 7 seq.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[86:13](sbe0229.htm#fr_484.md) Weber, Ind. Stud.
X, 102. According to the greatness of the crime the number of the
burnt-oblations must be increased and the prayers be repeated.
