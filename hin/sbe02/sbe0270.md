### CHAPTER VI.

1\. (To salute) every day on meeting (by) an embrace of the feet, <span
id="fr_977"></span>[1](#fn_976.md)

2\. And (particularly) on return from a journey,

3\. (Is prescribed in the case) of parents, of their blood relations, of
elder (brothers), of persons venerable <span
id="fr_978"></span>[3](#fn_977.md)

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

on account, of their learning, and of the Gurus of the latter.

4\. On meeting (several persons, to whom such a salutation is due),
together, the most venerable (must be saluted first). <span
id="fr_979"></span>[4](#fn_978.md)

5\. On meeting persons who understand (the rule of returning salutes)
one shall salute (them) pronouncing one's name, and (saving) 'I N. N.
(ho! salute thee).' <span id="fr_980"></span>[5](#fn_979.md)

6\. Some (declare that) there is no restrictive rule for salutations
between man and wife. <span id="fr_981"></span>[6](#fn_980.md)

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

7\. (The feet of) other female (relations) than the mother, a paternal
uncle's wife and (elder) sisters (need) not (be embraced, nor need they
be saluted) except on return from a journey. <span
id="fr_982"></span>[7](#fn_981.md)

8\. The feet of wives of brothers and of the mother-in-law (need) not be
embraced (on any occasion).

9\. But (on the arrival of an) officiating priest, a father-in-law,
paternal and maternal uncles who are younger (than oneself), one must
rise; they need not be saluted (as prescribed above, Sûtra 5). <span
id="fr_983"></span>[9](#fn_982.md)

10\. In like manner (any) other aged fellow-citizen, even a *S*ûdra of
eighty years and more, (must be honoured) by one young enough to be his
son, <span id="fr_984"></span>[10](#fn_983.md)

11\. (And) an Ârya, though (he be) younger, by a *S*ûdra; <span
id="fr_985"></span>[11](#fn_984.md)

12\. And he shall avoid (to pronounce) the name of that (person who is
worthy of a salutation). <span id="fr_986"></span>[12](#fn_985.md)

13\. And an official who (is) not (able to) recite (the Veda shall avoid
to pronounce the name) of the king.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

14\. A contemporary who is born on the same day (shall be addressed with
the terms) bho*h* or bhavan (your honour), <span
id="fr_987"></span>[14](#fn_986.md)

15\. (Likewise) a fellow-citizen who is ten years older (than
oneself), <span id="fr_988"></span>[15](#fn_987.md)

16\. (Also) an artist who is five years (older), <span
id="fr_989"></span>[16](#fn_988.md)

17\. And a *S*rotriya belonging to one's own Vedic school who is three
years older, <span id="fr_990"></span>[17](#fn_989.md)

18\. (Further), Brâhma*n*as destitute of learning and those who follow
the occupations of Kshatriyas or Vai*s*yas, <span
id="fr_991"></span>[18](#fn_990.md)

19\. And (a contemporary) who has performed the Dîksha*n*îyesh*t*i of a
Soma-sacrifice before he buys (the Soma).

20\. Wealth, relations, occupation, birth, learning, and age must be
honoured; (but) each later named <span id="fr_992"></span>[20](#fn_991.md)

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (quality) is more important (than the preceding
ones).

21\. But sacred learning is more important than all (other good
qualities), <span id="fr_993"></span>[21](#fn_992.md)

22\. Because that is the root of the sacred law,

23\. And because the Veda (expressly declares it). <span
id="fr_994"></span>[23](#fn_993.md)

24\. Way must be made for a man seated in a carriage, for one who is in
his tenth (decade), for one requiring consideration, for a woman, for a
Snâtaka, and for a king. <span id="fr_995"></span>[24](#fn_994.md)

25\. But a king (must make way) for a *S*rotriya. <span
id="fr_996"></span>[25](#fn_995.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_976"></span>[207:1](sbe0270.htm#fr_977.md) **VI**. Âpastamba
I, 4, 14, 7-9; I, 2, 5, 18; I, 2, 8, 17-18.

<span id="fn_977"></span>[207:3](sbe0270.htm#fr_978.md) 'Their blood
relations, i.e. paternal and maternal uncles and the rest; elders, i.e.
elder brothers; persons venerable on account of their learning, i.e. the
teacher who has initiated him (â*k*ârya), the teacher who has instructed
him (upâdhyâya), and the rest.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[208:4](sbe0270.htm#fr_979.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 6,
29; 1, 2, 8, 19. 'on meeting his mother and other persons whose feet
must be embraced, he shall first embrace the highest, i.e. the most
excellent, afterwards the others. Who the most excellent is has been
declared above, II, 50-51.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[208:5](sbe0270.htm#fr_980.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 5,
12-15. Professor Stenzler reads a*gñ*asamavâye, while my copies and
their commentary show that *gñ*asamavâye has to be read. Besides, it
seems impossible to make any sense out of the former reading without
assuming that the construction is strongly elliptical. 'On meeting, i.e.
on corning together with him who knows the rule of returning a salute,
he shall utter, i.e. loudly pronounce his name, i.e. the name which he
has received on the tenth day (after his birth), and which is to be
employed in saluting, and speak the word "I" as well as the word "this."
They declare that instead of the word "this," which here is explicitly
prescribed, the word "I am" must be used. Some salute thus, "I Haradatta
by name" others, "I Haradatta*s*arman;" and the common usage is to say,
"I Haradatta*s*arman by name." Thus the salutation must be made.
Salutation means saluting. The affix a*k* is added to causatives and the
rest. With reference to this matter the rule for returning salutes has
been described by Manu II, 126. . . . As (in the above Sûtra) the
expression "on meeting persons knowing" is used, those who are
unacquainted with the manner of returning a salute must not be saluted
in this manner. How is it then to be done? It is described by Manu III,
123.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[208:6](sbe0270.htm#fr_981.md) 'As Gautama says,
"Some declare," the restrictive rule must, in his opinion, be
followed.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_981"></span>[209:7](sbe0270.htm#fr_982.md) Manu II, 132;
Âpastamba I, 4, 14, 6, 9.

<span id="fn_982"></span>[209:9](sbe0270.htm#fr_983.md) Âpastamba I, 4, 14,
11.

<span id="fn_983"></span>[209:10](sbe0270.htm#fr_984) 'Old (pûrva.md), i.e.
of greater age. . A *S*ûdra even, who answers this description, must be
honoured by rising, not, however, be saluted by one young enough to be
his son, i.e. by a Brâhma*n*a who is very much younger. The *S*ûdra is
mentioned as an instance of a man of inferior caste. Hence a *S*ûdra
must (under these circumstances) be honoured by rising, not be saluted
by men of the three higher castes, a Vai*s*ya by those of the two higher
castes, and a Kshatriya by a Brâhma*n*a.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_984"></span>[209:11](sbe0270.htm#fr_985.md) 'An Ârya, i.e. a
man of the three twice-born castes, though he be inferior, i.e. younger,
must be honoured by rising, not be saluted by a *S*ûdra. The *S*ûdra is
mentioned in order to give an instance of (a man of) inferior
caste.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[209:12](sbe0270.htm#fr_986.md) 'An inferior shall
avoid to take his name, i.e. that of a superior.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_986"></span>[210:14](sbe0270.htm#fr_987.md) Haradatta says
that samânehani, 'on the same day,' means 'in the same year.' He is
probably right in thinking that the expression must not be interpreted
too strictly. But his assertion that aha*h* means also 'year' cannot be
proved by his quotation from the Nigha*nt*uka, abde sa*m*vatsaram
ahar*g*aram.

<span id="fn_987"></span>[210:15](sbe0270.htm#fr_988.md) 'A person aged by
ten years, i.e. at least ten years older, who lives in the same town as
oneself, is to be addressed as bho*h*, bhavan, though he may be
deficient in good qualities.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_988"></span>[210:16](sbe0270.htm#fr_989.md) 'The words "years
older" must be understood. He who lives by the fine arts (kalâ), i.e.
the knowledge of music, painting leaf-cutting, and the like, and is at
least five years older than oneself, must be addressed as bho*h* or
bhavan.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_989"></span>[210:17](sbe0270.htm#fr_990.md) Haradatta notes
that Âpastamba I, 4, 14, 13 gives a somewhat different rule.

<span id="fn_990"></span>[210:18](sbe0270.htm#fr_991.md) Haradatta adds
that a person destitute of learning, be he ever so old, may still be
treated as an equal, and addressed as bho*h*, bhavan, by a more learned
man,

<span id="fn_991"></span>[210:20](sbe0270.htm#fr_992.md) Manu II, 136. 'As
wealth and the rest cannot be directly honoured, the persons possessing
them are to be honoured . . . . . Respect (mâna) means honour shown by
saluting and the like.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_992"></span>[211:21](sbe0270.htm#fr_993.md) Manu II, 154.

<span id="fn_993"></span>[211:23](sbe0270.htm#fr_994.md) Haradatta says
that a passage to this effect occurs in the *Kh*ândogya-brâhma*n*a. He
also refers to Manu II, 151.

<span id="fn_994"></span>[211:24](sbe0270.htm#fr_995.md) Âpastamba II, 5,
11, 5, 7-9. 'A person requiring consideration, i.e. one afflicted by
disease. A woman, i.e. a bride or a pregnant woman. A Snâtaka, i.e. a
person who has bathed after completing his studies and after having kept
the vow of studentship.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_995"></span>[211:25](sbe0270.htm#fr_996.md) Âpastamba II, 5,
11, 6.
