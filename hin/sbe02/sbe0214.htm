<P><A NAME="fn_281"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_282">40:3</A> Haradatta names as such gods, Nand&icirc;svara and Kubera. Other commentators, however, explain Manushyaprakriti by Manushyamukha, 'possessing human faces.' A similar rule occurs Gautama XVI, 34, Where a Manushyayag&ntilde;a is mentioned as a cause for discontinuing the recitation of the Veda. In his Commentary on Gautama, also, Haradatta is in doubt. He first refers the term to the sacraments like the S&icirc;mantonnayana, and then adds, that some explain it to mean 'a sacrifice to gods who formerly were men.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_282"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_283">40:4</A> This S&ucirc;tra is an exception to I, 3, 10, 28.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_283"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_284">40:6</A> Haradatta's commentary on this S&ucirc;tra is very meagre, and he leaves the word anuv&acirc;kyam unexplained. I am not ccrtain that my explanation is correct. But it is countenanced by the statements of the G<I>ri</I>hya-sutras regarding the order of studying. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 132.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_284"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_285">41:7</A> Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>. I, 145. This S&ucirc;tra is a <I>G</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;paka or 'such a one which indicates the existence of a rule not expressly mentioned! Above (I, 3, 9, 1) the yearly -performance of the Up&acirc;karma and Utsarga ceremonies for the beginning and end of the Brahmanic term has been prescribed. In this S&ucirc;tra the performance of the Upakarma and Utsarga at the beginning and completion of the P&acirc;r&acirc;yana or the vow to go through a whole Veda is incidentally mentioned. Thence it may be inferred that these ceremonies must. be likewise performed on the latter occasions, though no absolute rule to this effect has been given. Such <I>G</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;pakas are of frequent occurrence in all S&ucirc;tras, and constitute one of the chief difficulties of their interpretation.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_286"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_287">41:11</A> Others explain the S&ucirc;tra thus: 'If he meets fellow-students, after they have come home from a journey, he shall not study with them on that day.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_289"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_290">42:20</A> According to Haradatta, &Acirc;pastamba uses the word Anuv&acirc;ka in order to indicate that smaller portions of the Veda may be studied. Others think, that by Anuv&acirc;ka, the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; and the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a are meant, and that the study of the A&#7749;gas is permitted. The Vasantotsava, or spring festival, which, according to the Dramas, was, in olden times, kept all over India, falls, according to Haradatta, on the thirteenth of the first half of <I>K</I>aitra, about the beginning of April.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_290"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_291">42:21</A> 'Hence, if one has forgotten it and eaten one's breakfast, a penance, not the Brahmaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, must be performed'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_291"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_292">42:23</A> See Taittir&icirc;ya &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka II, 11, 1 and 11; &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. G<I>ri</I>. S&ucirc;. III, 2, 1-2. In our days this rule is usually not observed. Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as mostly recite at the daily Brahmaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, 'Veda-offering,' one particular formula, which symbolically comprises the whole Veda. A few learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a friends, however, have assured me, that they still recite the whole of their <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; every year according to this rule of &Acirc;pastamba.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_298"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_299">44:36</A> Other commentators interpret the S&ucirc;tra in a different sense. They take it to mean: 'And (luring the night (from the twelfth to the thirteenth of each half of the month, he shall not study at all, be it in or out of term).'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_299"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_300">44:37</A> 'What has been studied before, must not be studied (again) at any time in the vacation nor in the evening.'-- Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_300"></A><A HREF="sbe0214.htm#fr_301">44:38</A> Haradatta thinks that by 'Parishad,' Manu's and other Dharma-<I>s</I>&acirc;stras are meant. This explanation is, however, not exact. Parishad, 'assemblage,' means, in the language of the <I>S</I>&acirc;stras, either a Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>, an assemblage of learned Brahmans called together to decide some knotty point of law, or a Brahminical school, which studies a particular redaction of the Veda (see the Petersburg Dict. s. v.) The latter meaning is that applicable to this S&ucirc;tra. By 'Parishada<I>h</I>' are here intended the Vedic schools, and their writings and teaching. Gautama also says, XVI, 40. Pr&acirc;tividya<I>m</I> y&acirc;n smaranti&nbsp;smaranti, '(he shall observe the stoppages of the Veda-study) which they teach in (the writings belonging to) each of the Vedas.'</P>
