<span id="fn_620"></span>[124:12](sbe0245.htm#fr_621.md) Haradatta explains
the words *S*âstrair adhigatânâm, 'who whilst participating, according
to the sacred law, (in the rights of their caste,)' by 'who have been
sanctified according to the law by the sacraments, such as the
Garbhâdhâna, and are entitled (to the rights and occupations of their
caste).'

<span id="fn_621"></span>[125:16](sbe0245.htm#fr_622.md) Probably this
Sûtra is meant to give a general rule, and to exempt Brâhma*n*as in
every case from corporal punishment and servitude. Manu VIII, 379-380.
