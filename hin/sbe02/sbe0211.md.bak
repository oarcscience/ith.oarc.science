### Footnotes

<span id="fn_232"></span>[29:1](sbe0211.htm#fr_233.md) **8**. Haradatta
does not connect this Sûtra with the preceding one. He explains it by
itself: '(We will now declare) how a student (who has left his teacher,
but is not married) ought to behave.'

<span id="fn_233"></span>[29:6](sbe0211.htm#fr_234.md) 'If the teacher
comes to the house of his (former) pupil (who has become a householder),
he shall, for instance, not say, "Oh, what a beautiful dish!" in such a
manner, that his desire to obtain it becomes apparent.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[29:7](sbe0211.htm#fr_235.md) This opinion is
contrary to Âpastamba's view given in Sûtras 2 and 3 above.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[30:10](sbe0211.htm#fr_236.md) 'When he gives to
his teacher a wooden seat (with legs), he shall not sit on a cane-seat
(without legs), for the latter touches the ground on all
sides.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[30:11](sbe0211.htm#fr_237.md) Manu II, 119.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[30:12](sbe0211.htm#fr_238.md) This rule is an
exception to I, 2, 7, 5. Manu II, 204.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[30:13](sbe0211.htm#fr_239.md) 'The roller is an
implement used by husbandmen, with which the ploughed land is made even.
If one person ascends it and another drags it along, the ground becomes
even. If that is dragged by the teacher, the pupil shall ascend it at
his command. He shall not disobey from fear of the unseemliness of the
action.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[30:15](sbe0211.htm#fr_240.md) Manu II, 199;
regarding the term Guru, see above, I, 2, 6, 29.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[31:17](sbe0211.htm#fr_241.md) This and the
following Sûtras refer to a person who has finished his studentship,
while the preceding ones, from Sûtra 8, apply to the time of studentship
also.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[31:24](sbe0211.htm#fr_242.md) Weber, Ind. Stud.
X, 126.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[32:26](sbe0211.htm#fr_243.md) 'Another
commentator says, "That pupil who offends his teacher in word, thought,
or deed, and directs his mind improperly, i.e. does not properly obey,
does not (any longer) remain a pupil."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[32:29](sbe0211.htm#fr_244.md) But see also Manu.
VIII, 299, where corporal punishment is permitted.
