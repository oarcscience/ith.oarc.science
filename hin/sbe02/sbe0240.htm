<p>4. If the (former) teacher visits him after he has returned home, he shall go out to meet him, embrace his (feet), and he shall not wash himself (after that act), showing disgust.

<P><A NAME="fn_572"></A><A HREF="sbe0240.htm#fr_573">111:1</A> <b>5</b>. This rule refers to the Up&acirc;karma, to be performed yearly by householders. In our days, too, the custom is observed, and the whole Brahminical community change on this occasion their <I>G</I>env&icirc;s or sacrificial cords in the month of Sr&acirc;va<I>n</I>a. The adherents of the various <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s of the Vedas, however, perform the ceremony on different days. According to Haradatta, the Upanishads are named, in order to show that they are of the highest importance. See also <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a X, 3, 5, 12.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_573"></A><A HREF="sbe0240.htm#fr_574">111:2</A> Others consider that this S&ucirc;tra refers to the annual Up&acirc;karma of the householder. In that case the translation would be, 'And after having performed the Up&acirc;karma,' &amp;c. Probably &Acirc;pastamba means to give a general rule, applicable both to householders and to students who have returned home.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_574"></A><A HREF="sbe0240.htm#fr_575">112:4</A> 'Though he may suspect that the teacher had been defiled by the touch of a <I>K</I>&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;la or the like, still he shall not show disgust nor wash himself.'--Haradatta. Regarding the rule of receiving guests, see below, II, 4, 8, 6 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_575"></A><A HREF="sbe0240.htm#fr_576">112:6</A> According to Haradatta, the repetition of the word &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ryam, 'the teacher,' in this S&ucirc;tra, indicates that the rule holds good not only when the teacher comes as a guest to his former pupil, but on every occasion when he receives water for sipping.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_576"></A><A HREF="sbe0240.htm#fr_577">112:7</A> 'He is called samudeta, "possessed of all (good qualities) together," who is endowed with (good) birth, disposition, behaviour, (great) learning, and a (venerable) age.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_577"></A><A HREF="sbe0240.htm#fr_578">112:8</A> The word sy&acirc;t is to be understood from S&ucirc;tra 5.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_578"></A><A HREF="sbe0240.htm#fr_579">113:13</A> Haradatta states that 'speaking evil' is forbidden here once more in order that it should be particularly avoided.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_579"></A><A HREF="sbe0240.htm#fr_580">113:14</A> 'For example, he shall not say, "The <A HREF="errata.htm#0"><I>Ri</I><I>g</I>-veda</A> is sweet to the ear, the other Vedas grate on the ear," or "the Taittir&icirc;ya-veda is a <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; consisting of leavings," or "the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a proclaimed by Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya is of modern origin."'--Haradatta. The second sentence refers to the story that Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya vomited the Black Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, and his fellow-students, becoming partridges, picked it up. Regarding the third sentence, see V&acirc;rttika on P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini IV, 3, 105, and Max M&uuml;ller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, P. 363.</P>
