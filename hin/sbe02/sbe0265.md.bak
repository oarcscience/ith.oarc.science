# GAUTAMA

# INSTITUTES OF THE SACRED LAW.

### CHAPTER I

1\. THE Veda is the source of the sacred law, <span
id="fr_796"></span>[1](#fn_795.md)

2\. And the tradition and practice of those who know the (Veda).

3\. Transgression of the law and violence ate observed (in the case) of
(those) great (men); but both are without force (as precedents) on
account of the weakness of the men of later ages. <span
id="fr_797"></span>[3](#fn_796.md)

4\. If (authorities) of equal force are conflicting, (either may be
followed at) pleasure.

5\. The initiation of a Brâhma*n*a (shall ordinarily take place) in his
eighth year;

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

6\. (It may also be performed) in the ninth or fifth (years) for the
fulfilment of (some particular) wish. <span
id="fr_798"></span>[6](#fn_797.md)

7\. The number of years (is to be calculated) from conception. <span
id="fr_799"></span>[7](#fn_798.md)

8\. That (initiation) is the second birth. <span
id="fr_800"></span>[8](#fn_799.md)

9\. The (person) from whom he receives that (Sacrament is called) the
Â*k*ârya (teacher). <span id="fr_801"></span>[9](#fn_800.md)

10\. And (the same title is also bestowed) in consequence of the
teaching of the Veda. <span id="fr_802"></span>[10](#fn_801.md)

11\. (The initiation) of a Kshatriya (shall ordinarily take place) in
the eleventh (year after conception), and that of a Vai*s*ya in the
twelfth. <span id="fr_803"></span>[11](#fn_802.md)

12\. Up to the sixteenth year the time for the Sâvitrî of a Brâhma*n*a
has not passed, <span id="fr_804"></span>[12](#fn_803.md)

13\. Nor (for the initiation) of a Kshatriya up to the twentieth
(year). <span id="fr_805"></span>[13](#fn_804.md)

14\. (And the limit for that) of a Vai*s*ya (extends) two years beyond
(the latter term).

15\. The girdles (worn by students) shall be strings of Mu*ñg*a grass, a
bow-string, or a (wool) thread, according to the order (of the
castes). <span id="fr_806"></span>[15](#fn_805.md)

16\. (Their upper garments shall be) skins of black-bucks, spotted deer,
(or) he-goats. <span id="fr_807"></span>[16](#fn_806.md)

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

17\. Hempen or linen cloth, the (inner) bark (of trees), and woollen
blankets (may be worn as low garments by students) of all
(castes), <span id="fr_808"></span>[17](#fn_807.md)

18\. And undyed cotton cloth.

19\. Some (declare that it) even (may be dyed) red. <span
id="fr_809"></span>[19](#fn_808.md)

20\. (In that case the garment) of a Brâhma*n*a (shall be dyed with a
red dye) produced from a tree,

21\. (And those of students) of the other two (castes shall be) dyed
with madder or turmeric.

22\. The staff (carried by a student) of the Brâhma*n*a (caste shall be)
made of Biliva or Palâ*s*a wood. <span id="fr_810"></span>[22](#fn_809.md)

23\. Staves made of A*s*vattha or Pîlu wood (are fit) for (students of)
the remaining (two castes).

24\. Or (a staff cut from a tree) that is fit to be used at a sacrifice
(may be carried by students) of all (castes). <span
id="fr_811"></span>[24](#fn_810.md)

25\. (The staves must be) unblemished, bent (at the top) like a
sacrificial post, and covered by their bark. <span
id="fr_812"></span>[25](#fn_811.md)

26\. They shall reach the crown of the head, the forehead, (or) the tip
of the nose (according to the caste of the wearer). <span
id="fr_813"></span>[26](#fn_812.md)

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

27\. (It is) optional (for students) to shave (their heads), to wear the
hair tied in a braid, (or) to keep (merely) a lock on the crown of the
head tied in a braid (shaving the other portions of the head). <span
id="fr_814"></span>[27](#fn_813.md)

28\. If he becomes impure while holding things in his hands, he shall
(purify himself) by sipping water without laying (them on the
ground). <span id="fr_815"></span>[28](#fn_814.md)

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

29\. (As regards) the purification of things, (objects) made of metal
must be scoured, those made of clay should be thoroughly heated by fire,
those made of wood must be planed, and (cloth) made of thread should be
washed. <span id="fr_816"></span>[29](#fn_815.md)

30\. (Objects made of) stone, jewels, shells, (or) mother-of-pearl (must
be treated) like those made of metal. <span
id="fr_817"></span>[30](#fn_816.md)

31\. (Objects made of) bone and mud (must be treated) like wood. <span
id="fr_818"></span>[31](#fn_817.md)

himself from personal defilement. <span id="fr_822"></span>[35](#fn_821.md)

36\. Seated in a pure place, placing his right arm between his knees,
arranging his dress (or his <span id="fr_823"></span>[36](#fn_822.md)

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

sacrificial cord) in the manner required for a sacrifice to the gods, he
shall, after washing his hands up to the wrist, three or four times,
silently, sip water that reaches his heart; twice wipe (his lips);
sprinkle his feet and (his head); touch the cavities in the head
(severally) with (certain fingers of his) right hand; (and finally)
place (all the fingers) on the crown of his head and (on the navel).

37\. After sleeping, dining, and sneezing (he shall) again (sip water
though he may have done so before). <span
id="fr_824"></span>[37](#fn_823.md)

38\. (Remnants of food) adhering to the teeth (do not make the eater
impure as little) as his teeth, except if he touches them with his
tongue. <span id="fr_825"></span>[38](#fn_824.md)

39\. Some (declare, that such remnants do not defile) before they fall
(from their place). <span id="fr_826"></span>[39](#fn_825.md)

40\. If they do become detached, he should know that he is purified by
merely swallowing them, as (in the case of) saliva. <span
id="fr_827"></span>[40](#fn_826.md)

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

41\. Drops (of saliva) failing from the mouth do not cause impurity,
except if they fall on a limb of the body. <span
id="fr_828"></span>[41](#fn_827.md)

42\. Purification (from defilement) by unclean substances (has been
effected) when the stains and the (bad) smell have been removed. <span

id="fr_831"></span>[44](#fn_830.md)

45\. And in case the Veda ordains (a particular manner of purification,
it must be performed according to the precept). <span
id="fr_832"></span>[45](#fn_831.md)

46\. Taking hold with (his right) hand of the left <span
id="fr_833"></span>[46](#fn_832.md)

hand (of his teacher), but leaving the thumb free, (the pupil) shall
address his teacher, (saying): 'Venerable Sir, recite!'

47\. He shall fix his eyes and his mind on the (teacher). <span
id="fr_834"></span>[47](#fn_833.md)

48\. He shall touch with Ku*s*a grass the (seat of the) vital
airs. <span id="fr_835"></span>[48](#fn_834.md)

49\. He shall thrice restrain his breath for (the space of) fifteen
moments; <span id="fr_836"></span>[49](#fn_835.md)

54\. After having received permission, the pupil <span
id="fr_840"></span>[54](#fn_839.md)

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

shall sit down to the right (of his teacher), turning his face towards
the east or towards the north,

55\. And the Sâvitrî must be recited; <span
id="fr_841"></span>[55](#fn_840.md)

56\. (All these acts must be performed) at the beginning of the
instruction in the Veda. <span id="fr_842"></span>[56](#fn_841.md)

57\. The syllable Om (must precede the recitation of) other (parts of
the Veda) also, <span id="fr_843"></span>[57](#fn_842.md)

58\. If (any one) passes between (the teacher and the pupil) the worship
(of the teacher must be performed) once more. <span
id="fr_844"></span>[58](#fn_843.md)

59\. If a dog, an ichneumon, a snake, a frog, (or) a cat (pass between
the teacher and the pupil) a three days' fast and a journey (are
necessary). <span id="fr_845"></span>[59](#fn_844.md)

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

60\. (In case the same event happens) with other (animals, the pupil)
must thrice restrain his breath and eat clarified butter, <span
id="fr_846"></span>[60](#fn_845.md)

61\. And (the same expiation must be performed), if (unwittingly) a
lesson in the Veda has been given on the site of a burial-ground. <span
id="fr_847"></span>[61](#fn_846.md)

Kataka and Bhâradvâ*g*a, Vasish*th*a's marriage with the *K*â*nd*âlî

the term 'avara,' translated by 'men of later ages,' to mean 'men like
ourselves' (asmadâdi). In his comment on the parallel passage of
Âpastamba be renders it by idânîntana, 'belonging to our times;' and in
his notes on Âpastamba I, 2, 5, 4, he substitutes arvâ*k*îna
kaliyugavartin, 'men of modern times living in the Kaliyuga.' The last
explanation seems to me the most accurate, if it is distinctly kept in
mind that in the times of Gautama the Kaliyuga was not a definite period
of calculated duration, but the Iron Age of sin as opposed to the
happier times when justice still dwelt on earth.

(unclean trees) are excluded.'--Haradatta. Regarding the Vibhîtaka, see
Report of Tour in Ka*s*mîr, Journal Bombay Br. Roy. As. Soc. XXXIV A, p.
8.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[177:25](sbe0265.htm#fr_812.md) Manu II, 47.
'Unblemished means uninjured by worms and the like'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[177:26](sbe0265.htm#fr_813.md) Manu II, 46.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[178:27](sbe0265.htm#fr_814.md) Âpastamba I, 1, 2,
31-32. The above translation follows the reading of my MSS.
mu*nd*a*g*a*t*ila*s*ikhâ*g*a*t*â vâ, which seems more in accordance with
the Sûtra style. It must, however, be understood that the arrangement of
the hair is not regulated by the individual choice of the student, but
by the custom of his family, school, or country. In the commentary, as
given by one of my MSS., it is stated the custom of shaving the whole
head prevailed among the *Kh*andogas. Max Müller, History of Ancient
Sanskrit Literature, p. 53; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 95.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[178:28](sbe0265.htm#fr_815.md) The above
translation agrees with Professor Stenzler's text and Manu V, 143. But
according to Haradatta the meaning of. the Sûtra is not so simple. His
explanation is as follows: 'If while holding things in his hands he
becomes impure, i.e. he is defiled by urine, fæces, leavings of food,
and the like (impurities) which are causes for sipping water, then he
shall sip water after placing those things on the ground. This refers to
uncooked food, intended to be eaten. And thus Vasish*th*a (III, 4, 3,
Benares edition) declares: "If he who is occupied with eatables touches
any impure substance, then he shall place that thing on the ground, sip
water, and afterwards again use it." But the following text of another
Sm*ri*ti, "A substance becomes pure by being sprinkled with water after
having been placed on the ground," refers to cooked food, such as boiled
rice and the like. Or (the above Sûtra may mean), "If he becomes impure
while holding things in his hands, then he shall sip water without
laying them on the ground." And thus Manu (V, 143) says: "He who carries
in any manner anything in his hands and is touched by an impure
substance shall cleanse himself by sipping water without laying his
burden down." This rule refers to things not destined to be eaten, such
as garments. And in the (above) Sûtra the words, "He who becomes impure
shall sip water," must be taken as one sentence, and (the whole), " If
while holding things in his hands he becomes impure, <span
id="page_179">p. 179</span> he shall sip water without laying (them)
down," must be taken as a second.'

Though it may be doubted if the yogavibhâga, or ' division of the
construction,' proposed by Haradatta, is admissible, still it seems to
me not improbable that Gautama intended his Sûtra to be taken in two
different ways. For, if according to the ancient custom it is written
without an Avagraha and without separating the words joined by Sandhi,
dravyabasta u*kkh*ish*t*onidhâyâ*k*âmet, the latter group may either
stand for u*kkh*ish*t*o nidhâya â*k*âmet or for u*kkh*is*t*o anidhâya
â*k*âmet. As the Sûtra-kâras aim before all things at brevity, the Sûtra
may have to be read both ways. If that had to be done, the correct
translation would be: 'If while holding things in his hands, be becomes
impure, he shall (purify himself by) sipping water, either laying (his
burden) down (or) not laying it down, (as the case may require.)'

<span id="fn_815"></span>[179:29](sbe0265.htm#fr_816.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 10-12; Manu V, 115, 122.

<span id="fn_816"></span>[179:30](sbe0265.htm#fr_817.md) Manu V, 111-112.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[179:31](sbe0265.htm#fr_818.md) 'Bone, i.e. ivory
and the like. Mud, i.e. (the mud floor of) a house and the like. The
purification of these two is the same as that of wood, i.e. by scraping
(or planing). How is it proper that, since the author has declared
(Sûtra 29) that objects made of wood shall be purified by planing, the
expression "like wood" should be substituted (in this Sûtra)? (The
answer is that), as the author uses the expression "like wood," when he
ought to have said "like objects made of wood," he indicates thereby
that the manner of purification is the same for the material as for the
object made thereof.'--Haradatta. The <span id="page_180">p. 180</span>
Sûtra is, therefore, a so-called *Gñ*apaka, intended to reveal the
existence of a general rule or paribhâshâ which has not been given
explicitly.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[180:32](sbe0265.htm#fr_819.md) 'Scattering over,
i.e. heaping on (earth) after bringing it from another spot is an
additional method of purifying earth. With regard to this matter
Vasish*th*a (III, 57) says: "Earth is purified by these four (methods,
viz.) by digging, burning scraping, being trodden on by cows, and,
fifthly, by being smeared with cowdung."'--Haradatta.

What Haradatta and probably Gautama mean, is that the mud floors of
houses, verandahs, and spots of ground selected for sitting on, if
defiled, should be scraped, and that afterwards fresh earth should be
scattered over the spot thus cleansed. See, however, Manu V, 125, who
recommends earth for the purification of other things also. The Sûtra
may also be interpreted so as to agree with his rule.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[180:33](sbe0265.htm#fr_820) 'Chips (vidala.md),
i.e. something made of chips of ratan-cane or bamboo, or, according to
others, something made of feathers.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[180:34](sbe0265.htm#fr_821.md) 'The word "or" is
used in order to exclude the alternative (i.e. the methods of
purification described above).'--Haradatta. For the explanation of the
expression 'very much' Haradatta refers to Vasish*th*a III, 58, with
which Manu V, 123 may be compared.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[180:35](sbe0265.htm#fr_822.md) 'The alternative
(position) depends on the pleasure of the performer.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[180:36](sbe0265.htm#fr_823.md) My MSS. more
conveniently make five Sûtras of Professor Stenzler's one Sûtra. The
divisions have been marked in the translation by semicolons.

*a*. 'How many times? Three times or four times; the alternative <span
id="page_181">p. 181</span> depends upon the pleasure of the performer.
Another (commentator says): When, according to a special rule of the
Vedas the sipping must be accompanied by the recitation of sacred texts,
then the act shall be repeated four times, else three
times.'--Haradatta.

*b*. The custom of touching the lips twice is noted as the opinion of
some, by Âpastamba I, 5, 16, 4.

*c*. '"Sprinkle his feet and." On account of the word "and" he shall
sprinkle his head also.'--Haradatta.

*d*. '"Touch the cavities, &c." Here the word "and" indicates that each
organ is to be touched separately.'--Haradatta. Regarding the manner of
touching, see Âpastamba I, 5, 16, 5 and 7 note.

*e*. '"(And finally) place," &c. Because the word "and" is used, he
shall touch the navel and the head with all the fingers'--Haradatta.
Regarding the whole Â*k*amanakalpa, see Âpastamba I, 5, 16, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_823"></span>[181:37](sbe0265.htm#fr_824.md) Manu V, 145.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[181:38](sbe0265.htm#fr_825.md) Manu V, 141.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[181:39](sbe0265.htm#fr_826.md) Vasish*th*a III,
41.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[181:40](sbe0265.htm#fr_827.md) 'As the author
ought to have said, "If they become detached, <span id="page_182">p.
182</span> he is purified by merely swallowing them," the addition of
the words "he should know" and "as in the case of saliva" is intended to
indicate that in the case of saliva, too, he becomes pure by swallowing
it, and that purification by sipping need not be considered
necessary.'--Haradatta. This Sûtra consists of the second half of a
verse, quoted by Baudhâyana I, 5, 8, 25, and Vasish*th*a III, 41.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[182:41](sbe0265.htm#fr_828.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
16, 12.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[182:42](sbe0265.htm#fr_829.md) In explanation of
the term amedhya, 'unclean substances,' Haradatta quotes Manu V, 135.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[182:43](sbe0265.htm#fr_830.md) Manu V, 134; see
also Âpastamba I, 5, 16, 15.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[182:44](sbe0265.htm#fr_831.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
16, 14.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[182:45](sbe0265.htm#fr_832.md) 'If the Veda
ordains any particular manner of purification for any particular
purpose, that alone must be adopted. Thus the sacrificial vessels called
*k*amasa, which have been stained by remnants of offerings, must be
washed with water on the heap of earth called mâr*g*âlîya.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[182:46](sbe0265.htm#fr_833.md) This and the
following rules refer chiefly to the teaching of the Sâvitrî, which
forms part of the initiation. According to Gobhila G*ri*hya-sûtra II,
10, 38, the complete sentence addressed to the teacher is, 'Venerable
Sir, recite! May the worshipful one teach me the Sâvitrî!'

23; I, 7, 6, 20; Manu II, 192.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[183:48](sbe0265.htm#fr_835) 'The (seat of the.md)
vital airs are the organs of sense located in the head. The pupil shall
touch these, his own (organs of sense) located in the head, in the order
prescribed for the Â*k*amana (see Âpastamba, I, 5, 16, 7
note).'--Haradatta, See also Manu II, 75.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[183:49](sbe0265.htm#fr_836.md) Passing one's hand
along the side of the knee, one will fill the space of one Tru*t*ikâ.
That is one moment (mâtrâ).'--Haradatta. Manu II, 75.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[183:50](sbe0265.htm#fr_837.md) Manu II, 75.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[183:51](sbe0265.htm#fr_838.md) 'In the
Vyâh*ri*ti-sâmans (see Burnell, Ârsheya-br., Index s.v.) five
Vyâh*ri*tis are mentioned, viz. Bhû*h*, Bhuva*h*, Sva*h*, Satyam,
Purusha*h*. Each of these is to be preceded by the syllable Om. But they
are to end with Purusha*h*, which (in the above enumeration) occupies
the fourth place.'--Haradatta, See also Manu II, 75 seq.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[183:52](sbe0265.htm#fr_839.md)-53. Âpastamba I,
2, 5, 18-20.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[183:54](sbe0265.htm#fr_840.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 6,
24; Manu II, 193. Turning his face towards the east or towards the
north." This alternative depends upon (the nature of) the
business.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[184:55](sbe0265.htm#fr_841.md) Manu II, 77.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[184:56](sbe0265.htm#fr_842.md) 'All those acts
beginning with the touching of the organs of sense with Ku*s*a grass and
ending with the recitation of the Sâvitrî, which have been prescribed
(Sûtras 48-57, must be performed before the pupil begins to study the
Veda with his teacher, but should not be repeated daily. After the
initiation follows the study of the Sâvitrî. The touching of the organs
of sense and the other (acts mentioned) form part of this (study). But
the rules prescribed in the three Sûtras, the first of which is Sûtra
52, and the rule to direct the eye and mind towards the teacher (Sûtra
47), must be constantly kept in mind. This decision is confirmed by the
rules of other Sm*ri*tis and of the G*ri*hya-sûtras.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[184:57](sbe0265.htm#fr_843.md) Âpastamba I, 4,
13, 6-7.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[184:58](sbe0265.htm#fr_844.md) 'The worship of
the teacher (upasadana) consists in the performance of the acts
prescribed in Sûtras 46-57, with the exception of the study of the
Sâvitrî and the acts belonging to that. The meaning of the Sûtra is
that, though the worship of the teacher may have already been performed
in the morning of that day, it must, nevertheless, be repeated for the
reason stated.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[184:59](sbe0265.htm#fr_845.md) 'A journey
(vipravâsa) means residence in some other place than the teacher's
house.'--Haradatta. The commentator adds that the somewhat different
rule, given by Manu IV, 126, may be reconciled with the above, by
referring the former to the study for the sake of remembering texts
recited by the teacher (dhâra*n*âdhyayana), and the latter to the first
instruction in the sacred texts.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[185:60](sbe0265.htm#fr_846.md) 'This penance must
be performed by the pupil, not by the teacher. Others declare that both
shall perform it.'--Haradatta.

I, 3, 9, 6-8. The last clauses of this and all succeeding chapters are
