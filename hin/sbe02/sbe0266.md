### Footnotes

<span id="fn_847"></span>[185:1](sbe0266.htm#fr_848.md) **II**. In
concluding the explanation of this Sûtra, Haradatta states that its last
clause is intended to give an instance of the freedom of behaviour
permitted to a child. In his opinion Gautama indicates thereby that a
person who, before initiation, drinks spirituous liquor, commits murder
or other mortal sins, becomes an outcast, and is liable to perform the
penances prescribed for initiated sinners. In support of this view be
quotes a passage, taken from an unnamed Sm*ri*ti, according to which the
parents or other relatives of children between five and eleven years are
to perform penances vicariously for the latter, while children between
eleven and fifteen years are declared to be liable to half the penances
prescribed for initiated adults. Hence he infers that though the above
text of Gautama speaks of uninitiated persons in general, its provisions
really apply to children under five years of age only. Though it would
seem that some of Gautama's rules refer to half-grown persons rather
than to infants or very young boys, it is impossible to assume that
Gautama meant to give full licence of behaviour, speech, and eating to
Brâhma*n*as who were not <span id="page_186">p. 186</span> initiated
before their sixteenth year, or to Kshatriyas and Vai*s*yas up to the
age of twenty and twenty-two. It seems more likely that, as Haradatta
thinks, his rules are meant in the first instance for infants and very
young children only, and that he intended the special cases of
half-grown or nearly grown up boys to be dealt with according to the
custom of the family or of the country.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[186:2](sbe0266.htm#fr_849.md) Haradatta points
out that the Sûtra does not forbid uninitiated persons to sip water, but
that it merely denies the applicability of the rules (kalpa) given
above, I, 36. Uninitiated persons may, therefore, sip water in the
manner practised by women and *S*ûdras.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[186:4](sbe0266.htm#fr_850.md) Âpastamba II, 6,
15, 18; Manu XI, 36.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[186:5](sbe0266.htm#fr_851.md) 'The expression "
pronouncing Svadhâ" includes by implication the performance of all
funeral rites.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[186:7](sbe0266.htm#fr_852.md) Âpastamba I, 1, 2,
26.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[186:8](sbe0266.htm#fr_853.md) Âpastamba I, 1, 4,
14-17; I, 1, 3, 25; I, 2, 28-30; Manu II, 176.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[187:9](sbe0266.htm#fr_854.md) Regarding the
sacrament called Godâna, see Gobhila G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 9, 26.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[187:10](sbe0266.htm#fr_855.md) Âpastamba I, 11,
30, 8.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[187:11](sbe0266.htm#fr_856.md) 'From (the time
when one) light (is still visible,' &c.), i.e. in the morning from the
time when the stars are still visible until the sun rises, and in the
evening from the time when the sun still stands above the horizon until
the stars appear. Haradatta observes <span id="page_188">p. 188</span>
that, as Manu II, 102 prescribes the recitation of the Gâyatrî during
the morning and evening devotions, either his or Gautama's rule may be
followed. He adds that another commentator refers the injunction to keep
silence to conversations on worldly matters only. He himself has adopted
this view in his commentary on Âpastamba I, 11, 30, 8.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[187:12](sbe0266.htm#fr_857.md) Âpastamba I, 11,
31, 18.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[187:13](sbe0266.htm#fr_858.md) Âpastamba I, 1, 2,
23-28; I, 1, 3, 11-14, 20-24; I, 2, 7, 5.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[187:14](sbe0266.htm#fr_859.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 6,
3, 14, 17-18. The term Guru includes, besides the teacher, the parents
and other venerable persons.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[187:15](sbe0266.htm#fr_860.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 7,
6-7; II, 2, 5, 9. Haradatta observes that this Sûtra again contains a
general rule, and does not merely refer to the presence of Gurus.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[188:16](sbe0266.htm#fr_861.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 7,
3, 8-10.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[188:17](sbe0266.htm#fr_862.md) Âpastamba. I, 1,
3, 12. '"Low service," i.e. service by wiping off urine, fæces, and the
like. . . . That is not even to be performed for the teacher. Or the
expression may mean that he shall not serve a teacher deficient in
learning and virtue. The same opinion is expressed by Âpastamba I, 1,
x,11.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[188:18](sbe0266.htm#fr_863.md) Manu II, 199.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[188:19](sbe0266.htm#fr_864.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 7,
24.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[188:20](sbe0266.htm#fr_865.md) 'A Brâhma*n*a
shall avoid it always, i.e. even as a householder; Kshatriyas and
Vai*s*yas need do it only as long as they are students. But in their
case, too, they forbid the use of, liquor distilled from bruised rice,
under all circumstances.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[188:21](sbe0266.htm#fr_866.md) Âpastamba I, 1, 2,
21; I, 1, 4, 22, 28.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[188:22](sbe0266.htm#fr_867.md) Âpastamba I, 1, 3,
13. 'Keeping his arms in subjection means that he shall not (without a
cause) break clods of earth and the like. Keeping his stomach in
subjection, i.e. eating with moderation.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[188:23](sbe0266.htm#fr_868.md) 'He shall indicate
it by another synonymous word, <span id="page_189">p. 189</span> e.g.
instead of saying, "Haradatta (given by Hara)," he shall say, the
venerable Bhavarâta (given by Bhava)."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[189:25](sbe0266.htm#fr_869.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 6,
5-7.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[189:26](sbe0266.htm#fr_870.md) He must not think
that, as the teacher cannot see him, he need not obey the summons.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[189:27](sbe0266.htm#fr_871.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 6,
15, 23.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[189:28](sbe0266.htm#fr_872) 'Work (karma.md)
means performance. The meaning is that the pupil shall announce to his
teacher the performance of all he is going to do. But what is useful for
the teacher, as fetching water and the like, be shall inform him of the
performance of that, i.e. knowing himself (without being told) that such
work is necessary at a particular time (and acting on this knowledge).
Any other explanation of this Sûtra does not please me.'--Haradatta. See
also Âpastamba I, 2, 6, 8. My MSS. divide this Sûtra into two, beginning
the second with 'Informing' &c. Haradatta's final remark, quoted above,
seems to indicate that the division was intended by him.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[189:29](sbe0266.htm#fr_873.md) Âpastamba I, 2, 5,
26.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[190:34](sbe0266.htm#fr_876.md) 'One who has
attained his majority, i.e. one who has completed his sixteenth year and
is (already) a youth.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[190:35](sbe0266.htm#fr_877.md) Haradatta explains
abhi*s*asta by upapâtakin, 'one who has committed a minor offence,'
apparently forgetting Âpastamba I, 7, 21, 7. See also Âpastamba I, 1, 3,
25.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[190:36](sbe0266.htm#fr_878.md) Âpastamba I, 1, 3,
28-30, where the formulas have been given in the notes. Haradatta
remarks that the *G*aimini G*ri*hya-sûtra forbids the lengthening or
drawling pronunciation of the syllables kshâ*m* and hi in begging.
Baudhâyana I, 2, 3, 16 likewise forbids it. In the text read
var*n*ânupûrvye*n*a.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[190:37](sbe0266.htm#fr_879.md) Manu II, 184. It
is just possible that the translation ought to be 'in the houses of his
teacher's blood relations,' instead of 'in the houses of his teacher
(and) of blood relations.'

<span id="fn_879"></span>[191:38](sbe0266.htm#fr_880.md) The meaning of the
Sûtra is, that if a student does not obtain anything from strangers, he
shall first go to his own family, next to the houses of Gurus, i.e.
paternal and maternal uncles and other venerable relatives, then to his
other blood relations, i.e. Sapi*nd*as, and in case of extreme necessity
only apply to the teacher's wife.
