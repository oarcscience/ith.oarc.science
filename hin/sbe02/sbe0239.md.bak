### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 2, KHA*ND*A 4.

1\. Near the bed (a Bali must be offered) with (a Mantra) addressed to
Kâma (Cupid).

2\. On the door-sill (a Bali must be placed) with (a Mantra) addressed
to Antariksha (the air). <span id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_556.md)

3\. With (the Mantra) that follows (in the Upanishad, he offers a Bali)
near the door. <span id="fr_558"></span>[3](#fn_557.md)

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

4\. With the following (ten Mantras, addressed to Earth, Air, Heaven,
Sun, Moon, the Constellations, Indra, B*ri*haspati, Pra*g*âpati, and
Brahman, he offers ten Balis, each following one to the east of the
preceding one), in (the part of the house called) the seat of
Brahma. <span id="fr_559"></span>[4](#fn_558.md)

5\. He shall offer to the south (of the Balis offered before, a Bali)
with a Mantra addressed to the Manes; his sacrificial cord shall be
suspended over the right shoulder, and the (palm of his right hand shall
be turned upwards and) inclined to the right. <span
id="fr_560"></span>[5](#fn_559.md)

6\. To the north (of the Bali given to the Manes, a Bali shall be
offered) to Rudra, in the same manner as to the (other) gods. <span
id="fr_561"></span>[6](#fn_560.md)

7\. The sprinkling with water (which precedes and follows the oblation)
of these two (Balis, takes place) separately, on account of the
difference of the rule (for each case). <span
id="fr_562"></span>[7](#fn_561.md)

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

8\. At night only he shall offer (the Bali to the Goblins), throwing it
in he air and reciting the last (Mantra). <span
id="fr_563"></span>[8](#fn_562.md)

9\. He who devoutly offers those (above-described), to the rules,
(obtains) Balis and Homas), according eternal bliss in heaven and
prosperity.

10\. And (after the Balis have been performed, a portion of the food)
must first be given as alms. <span id="fr_564"></span>[10](#fn_563.md)

11\. He shall give food to his guests first, <span
id="fr_565"></span>[11](#fn_564.md)

12\. And to infants, old or sick people, female (relations, and)
pregnant women. <span id="fr_566"></span>[12](#fn_565.md)

13\. The master (of the house) and his wife shall not refuse a man who
asks for food at the time (when the Vai*s*vadeva offering has been
performed).

14\. If there is no food, earth, water, grass, and a kind word, indeed,
never fall in the house of a good man. Thus (say those who know the
law). <span id="fr_567"></span>[14](#fn_566.md)

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

15\. Endless worlds are the portion (of those householders and wives)
who act thus.

16\. To a Brâhma*n*a who has not studied the Veda, a seat, water, and
food must be given. But (the giver) shall not rise (to do him
honour). <span id="fr_568"></span>[16](#fn_567.md)

17\. But if (such a man) is worthy of a salutation (for other reasons),
he shall rise to salute him.

18\. Nor (shall a Brâhma*n*a rise to receive) a Kshatriya or Vai*s*ya
(though they may be learned). <span id="fr_569"></span>[18](#fn_568.md)

19\. If a *S*ûdra comes as a guest (to a Brâhma*n*a), he shall give him
some work to do. He may feed him, after (that has been performed). <span
id="fr_570"></span>[19](#fn_569.md)

20\. Or the slaves (of the Brâhma*n*a householder) shall fetch (rice)
from the royal stores, and honour the *S*ûdra as a guest. <span
id="fr_571"></span>[20](#fn_570.md)

21\. (A householder) must always wear his garment over (his left
shoulder and under his right arm).

22\. Or he may use a cord only, slung over his left shoulder and passed
under his right arm, instead of the garment.

23\. He shall sweep together (the crumbs) on the place where he has
eaten, and take them away. He shall sprinkle water on that place,
turning the palm downwards, and remove the stains (of food from the
cooking-vessels with a stick), wash them with water, and take their
contents to a clean place to the north (of the house, offering them) to
Rudra. In this manner his house will become prosperous.

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

24\. It is declared in the Sm*ri*tis that a Brâhma*n*a alone should be
chosen as teacher (or spiritual guide). <span
id="fr_572"></span>[24](#fn_571.md)

25\. In times of distress a Brâhma*n*a may study under a Kshatriya or
Vai*s*ya.

26\. And (during his pupilship) he must walk behind (such a teacher).

27\. Afterwards the Brâhma*n*a shall take precedence before (his
Kshatriya or Vai*s*ya teacher).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_556"></span>[107:2](sbe0239.htm#fr_557.md) **4**. 'Others
explain dehalî', "the door-sill," to mean "the door-case."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[107:3](sbe0239.htm#fr_558.md) 'Others explain
apidhâna, "the panels of the door;" to mean "the bolt of the
door."'--Haradatta. The offering is made to Nâma, 'the name, or essence
of things.'

<span id="fn_558"></span>[108:4](sbe0239.htm#fr_559.md) Haradatta gives two
explanations of the word Brahmasadana, 'the seat of Brahman.' According
to some, it is an architectural term, designating the centre of the
house; according to others, it denotes the place where, at the time of
the burnt-oblations, the Brahman or superintending priest is seated,
i.e. a spot to the south of the sacred fire.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[108:5](sbe0239.htm#fr_560.md) Balis and water for
the Manes are placed or poured into the palm of the hand and thrown out
between the thumb and forefinger. That part of the palm is, therefore,
sometimes called 'the tîrtha sacred to the Manes.' See Manu II, 39.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[108:6](sbe0239.htm#fr_561.md) 'That is to say,
the sacrificial cord shall not be suspended over the right shoulder, nor
shall the Bali be thrown out between the thumb and
forefinger.'--Haradatta

<span id="fn_561"></span>[108:7](sbe0239.htm#fr_562.md) In sprinkling
around an offering to the gods, the sacrificer turns his right hand
towards the oblation and pours out the water, beginning in the south and
ending in the east. In sprinkling around an offering to the Manes,
exactly the opposite order is to be followed.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[109:8](sbe0239.htm#fr_563.md) At night, i. e.
before the evening meal. The Mantra is, 'To those beings which, being
servants of Vituda, roam about day and night, desiring a Bali-offering,
I offer this Bali, desirous of prosperity. May the Lord of prosperity
grant me prosperity, svâhâ. Haradatta adds, that according to another
commentator, no other Bali but this is to be offered in the evening, and
that some modify the Mantra for each occasion, offering the Bali in the
morning to the Bhûtas that roam about during the day,' and in the
evening 'to the night-walkers.' Compare for the whole section Manu III,
90-92; Yâ*gñ*. I, 102-104.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[109:10](sbe0239.htm#fr_564.md) Manu III, 94 seq.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[109:11](sbe0239.htm#fr_565.md) Manu III, 115;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 105.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[109:12](sbe0239.htm#fr_566.md) Manu III, 114;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 105.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[109:14](sbe0239.htm#fr_567.md) Manu III, 101
Yâ*gñ*. I, 107. As read in the text, the first line of the verse has one
syllable in excess. This irregularity would disappear if t*rin*â, the
Vedic form of the nom. ace. plural, were read for t*rin*âni, and it
seems to me not improbable that t*rin*âni is a correction made by a
Pandit who valued grammatical correctness higher than correctness of
metre.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[110:16](sbe0239.htm#fr_568.md) Manu III, 99.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[110:18](sbe0239.htm#fr_569.md) Manu III, 110-112;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 107.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[110:19](sbe0239.htm#fr_570.md) Manu loc. cit.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[110:20](sbe0239.htm#fr_571.md) 'Hence it is known
that the king ought to keep stores of rice and the like in every
village, in order to show hospitality to *S*ûdra guests.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[111:24](sbe0239.htm#fr_572.md) Manu II, 241, 242.
From here down to II, 3, 6, 2, Âpastamba again treats of the duties of
students and teachers, a subject which appears to have in his eyes a
greater importance than any other. The rules given now apply chiefly to
householders. It would seem that they have been inserted in this
particular place, because the reception of a former teacher is to be
described II, 3, 5, 4-11, and that of a 'learned guest' II, 3, 6, 3 seq.
