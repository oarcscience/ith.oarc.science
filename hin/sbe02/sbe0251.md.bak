### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 7, KHA*ND*A 16.

1\. Formerly men and gods lived together in this world. Then the gods in
reward of their sacrifices went to heaven, but men were left behind.
Those men who perform sacrifices in the same manner as the gods did,
dwell (after death) with the gods and Brahman in heaven. Now (seeing men
left behind), Manu revealed this ceremony, which is designated by the
word *S*râddha (a funeral-oblation). <span
id="fr_680"></span>[1](#fn_679.md)

2\. And (thus this rite has been revealed) for the salvation of
mankind. <span id="fr_681"></span>[2](#fn_680.md)

3\. At that (rite) the Manes (of one's father, grandfather, and
great-grand father) are the deities (to whom the sacrifice is offered).
But the Brâhma*n*as, (who are fed,) represent the Âhavanîya-fire. <span
id="fr_682"></span>[3](#fn_681.md)

4\. That rite must be performed in each month. <span
id="fr_683"></span>[4](#fn_682.md)

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

5\. The afternoon of (a day of) the latter half is preferable (for
it). <span id="fr_684"></span>[5](#fn_683.md)

6\. The last days of the latter half (of the month) likewise are
(preferable to the first days).

7\. (A funeral-oblation) offered on any day of the latter half of the
month gladdens the Manes. But it procures different rewards for the
sacrificer according to the time observed. <span
id="fr_685"></span>[7](#fn_684.md)

8\. If it be performed on the first day of the half-month, the issue (of
the sacrificer) will chiefly consist of females.

9\. (Performed on the second day it procures) children who are free from
thievish propensities.

10\. (If it is performed) on the third day children will be born to him
who will fulfil the various vows for studying (portions of the Veda).

11\. (The sacrificer who performs it) on the fourth day becomes rich in
small domestic animals.

12\. (If he performs it) on the fifth day, sons (will be born to him).
He will have numerous and distinguished offspring, and he will not die
childless. <span id="fr_686"></span>[12](#fn_685.md)

13\. (If he performs it) on the sixth day, he will become a great
traveller and gambler.

14\. (The reward of a funeral-oblation performed) on the seventh day is
success in agriculture.

15\. (If he performs it) on the eighth day (its reward is) prosperity

16\. (If he performs it) on the ninth day (its reward consists in)
one-hoofed animals.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

17\. (If he performs it) on the tenth day (its reward is) success in
trade.

18\. (If he performs it) on the eleventh day (its reward is) black iron,
tin, and lead.

19\. (If he performs a funeral-oblation) on the twelfth day, he will
become rich in cattle.

20\. (If he performs it) on the thirteenth day, he will have many sons
(and) many friends, (and) his offspring will be beautiful. But his
(sons) will die young. <span id="fr_687"></span>[20](#fn_686.md)

21\. (If he performs it) on the fourteenth day (its reward is) success
in battle. <span id="fr_688"></span>[21](#fn_687.md)

22\. (If he performs it) on the fifteenth day (its reward is)
prosperity.

23\. The substances (to be offered) at these (sacrifices) are sesamum,
mâsha, rice, yava, water, roots, and fruits. <span
id="fr_689"></span>[23](#fn_688.md)

24\. But, if food mixed with fat (is offered), the satisfaction of the
Manes is greater, and (lasts) a longer time,

25\. Likewise, if money, lawfully acquired, is given to worthy
(persons).

26\. Beef satisfies (the Manes) for a year, <span
id="fr_690"></span>[26](#fn_689.md)

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

27\. Buffalo's (meat) for a longer (time) than that.

28\. By this (permission of the use of buffalo's meat) it has been
declared that the meat of (other) tame and wild animals is fit to be
offered.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_679"></span>[140:1](sbe0251.htm#fr_680.md) **16**. 'Intending
to give the rules regarding the monthly *S*râddha, he premises this
explanatory statement in order to praise that sacrifice.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[140:2](sbe0251.htm#fr_681.md) The reading
'ni*hs*reyasâ ka' apparently has given great trouble to the
commentators. Their explanations are, however, grammatically impossible.
The right one is to take 'ni*hs*reyasâ as a Vedic instrumental, for
ni*hs*reyasena, which may designate the 'reason'. If the dative is read,
the sense remains the same.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[140:3](sbe0251.htm#fr_682.md) 'The comparison of
the Brâhma*n*as with the Âhavanîya indicates that to feed Brâhma*n*as is
the chief act at a *S*râddha.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[140:4](sbe0251.htm#fr_683.md) Manu III, 122, 123;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 217.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[141:5](sbe0251.htm#fr_684.md) Manu III, 255, 278.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[141:7](sbe0251.htm#fr_685.md) Manu III, 277;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 264, 265.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[141:12](sbe0251.htm#fr_686.md) The translation
follows the corrected reading given in the Addenda to the Critical
Notes.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[142:20](sbe0251.htm#fr_687.md) Others read the
last part of the Sûtra, ayuvamârmas-tu bhavanti, 'they will not die
young'--Haradatta. If the two halves of the Sûtra are joined and
Dar*s*anîyâpatyoyuvamâri*n*a*h* is read, the Sandhi may be dissolved in
either manner.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[142:21](sbe0251.htm#fr_688.md) Manu III, 276, and
Yâ*gñ*. I, 263, declare the fourteenth day to be unfit for a *S*râddha,
and the latter adds that *S*râddhas for men killed in battle may be
offered on that day. This latter statement explains why Âpastamba
declares its reward to be 'success in battle.' The nature of the reward
shows that on that day Kshatriyas, not Brâhma*n*as, should offer their
*S*râddhas.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[142:23](sbe0251.htm#fr_689.md) Manu III, 267;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 257.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[142:26](sbe0251.htm#fr_690.md) Manu III, 271.
