other persons, whose food is not considered fit to be eaten.

3\. And food unfit for oblations, speaking an untruth, anger, and (acts
or words) by which he might excite anger. He who desires a (good)
memory, fame, wisdom, heavenly bliss, and prosperity, shall avoid these
twelve (things and acts);

4\. Wearing a dress that reaches from the navel to the knees, bathing
morning, noon, and evening, living on food that has not been cooked at a
fire, never seeking the shade, standing (during the day), and sitting
(during the night), he shall keep this vow for one year. They declare,

10\. And he shall feed (Brâhma*n*as) possessed of all (good qualities).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_705"></span>[147:1](sbe0253.htm#fr_706.md) **18**. Sûtras 1-4
contain rules for a vow to be kept for the special objects mentioned in
Sûtras 3 and 4 for one year only Haradatta (on Sûtra 4) says that
another commentator thinks that Sûtras 1-3 prescribe one vow, and Sûtra
4 another, and that the latter applies both to householders and
students. A passage front Baudhâyana is quoted in support of this latter
view.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[147:5](sbe0253.htm#fr_707.md) Manu III, 82 seq.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[147:6](sbe0253.htm#fr_708.md) The term 'pure
(men)' is used in order to indicate that they must be so particularly,
because, by II, 2, 3, 11, purity has already been prescribed for cooks.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[148:7](sbe0253.htm#fr_709.md) For the unusual
meaning of dravya, 'vessel,' compare the term sîtâdravyâ*n*i,
'implements of husbandry,'--Manu IX, 293, and the Petersburg Dict. s. v.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[148:13](sbe0253.htm#fr_710.md) The red goat is
mentioned as particularly fit for a *S*râddha, Yâ*gñ*. I, 259, and Manu
III, 272.
