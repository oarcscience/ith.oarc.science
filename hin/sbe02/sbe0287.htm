<p>12.

Haradatta, remarks that other twice-born men also must perform the same penance in case they drink liquor forbidden to them, see above, II, 20 note. He also states that the offence must have been committed intentionally and repeatedly in order to justify so severe an expiation.

My best MSS. read gh&acirc;tayet, 'shall cause to be killed,' instead of Professor Stenzler's kh&acirc;dayet, 'shall cause to be devoured.' C. has kh&acirc;dayet, but its commentary, as well as that given in the other MSS., shows that gh&acirc;tayet is the correct reading. The text of the commentary runs as follows: Anantaroktavishaye gata<I>h</I> pum&acirc;n r&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc; gh&acirc;tayitvyo [kh&acirc;dayitavyo C.] vadhaprak&acirc;ra<I>s</I><I>k</I>&acirc;nantaram eva vasish<I>th</I>ava<I>k</I>ane dar<I>s</I>ita<I>h</I>. The passages of Vasish<I>th</I>a XXI, 1-3, which Haradatta has quoted in explanation of S&ucirc;tra 14, prescribe that the adulterer is to be burnt. Another objection to the reading kh&acirc;dayet is that the word would be superfluous. If Gautama had intended to prescribe the same punishment for the adulterer as for the woman, he would simply have said pum&acirc;<I>m</I>sam.</P>
