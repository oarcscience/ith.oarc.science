13\. Or to both (the natural father and the husband of the

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[270:1](sbe0282.htm#fr_1330) **XVIII**. Manu
V, 155. This Sûtra refers in the first instance to the inability of
wives to offer on their own account *S*rauta or G*ri*hya-sacrifices, or
to perform vows and religious ceremonies prescribed in the Purâ*n*as,
without the permission of their husbands. As the word strî means both
wife and woman, its ulterior meaning is, that women in general are never
independent; see Manu V, 148; IX, 3; Yâ*gñ*avalkya 1, 85.

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[270:2](sbe0282.htm#fr_1331) Âpastamba II, 10,
27, 6; Manu IX, 102.

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[270:3](sbe0282.htm#fr_1332) Manu V, 166;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 87.

<span id="fn_1332"></span>[270:4](sbe0282.htm#fr_1333) Âpastamba II, 10,
27, 2-3; Manu IX, 59-60; Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 68. Apati, 'she whose husband
is dead,' means literally, 'she who has no husband.' But as the case of
a woman whose husband has gone abroad, is discussed below, it follows
that the former translation alone is admissible. It must, of course, be
understood that the widow has no children.

<span id="fn_1333"></span>[271:5](sbe0282.htm#fr_1334) The Gurus are
here the husband's relatives, under whose protection the widow lives.

<span id="fn_1334"></span>[271:6](sbe0282.htm#fr_1335) Regarding the
term Sapi*nd*a, see above, XIV, 13; a Sagotra is a relative bearing the
same family name (laukika gotra) removed seven to thirteen degrees, or
still further. A Samânapravara is one who is descended from the same
*Ri*shi (vaidika gotra).

<span id="fn_1335"></span>[271:8](sbe0282.htm#fr_1336) Colebrooke V,
Digest 265. Haradatta explains atidvitîya, 'not more than two (sons),'
to mean 'not more than one son' (prathamam apatyam atîtya dvitîyam na
*g*anayed iti). But see Manu IX, 61.

<span id="fn_1336"></span>[271:9](sbe0282.htm#fr_1337) Âpastamba II, 6,
13, 6-7.

<span id="fn_1337"></span>[271:10](sbe0282.htm#fr_1338) Manu IX, 52.

<span id="fn_1338"></span>[271:11](sbe0282.htm#fr_1339) Manu IX, 145.
Such a son is called Kshetra*g*a, see below, XXVIII, 32.

<span id="fn_1339"></span>[271:12](sbe0282.htm#fr_1340) Manu IX, 144.

<span id="fn_1340"></span>[271:13](sbe0282.htm#fr_1341) Yâ*gñ*avalkya
II, 127. Such a son is called dvipit*ri* or dvyâmushyâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_1341"></span>[272:15](sbe0282.htm#fr_1342) Manu IX, 76.
'When the husband has disappeared, i.e. has gone to a foreign country,
his wife, though childless, shall wait for six years. After (the lapse
of) that (period) she may, if she desires it, produce a child (by
cohabiting with a Sapi*nd*a), after having been authorised thereto by
her Gurus. If the husband is heard of, i.e. that he dwells in such and
such a country, she shall go to him.'--Haradatta. Kshapa*n*a, 'waiting,'
is ambiguous, and may also mean being continent or emaciating herself.

<span id="fn_1342"></span>[272:17](sbe0282.htm#fr_1343) I.e. before she
goes to live with a Sapi*nd*a, or tries to follow her husband, in case
his residence is known.

<span id="fn_1343"></span>[272:20](sbe0282.htm#fr_1344) Manu IX, 90-92;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 64.

<span id="fn_1344"></span>[272:21](sbe0282.htm#fr_1345) Manu IX, 88.

<span id="fn_1345"></span>[272:22](sbe0282.htm#fr_1346) Manu IX, 4;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 64. 'He who,' i.e. the father or guardian.

<span id="fn_1346"></span>[273:24](sbe0282.htm#fr_1347) Manu XI, 11, 13.
Haradatta explains dharmatantra, 'a rite prescribed by the sacred law,'
here, as well as Sûtra 32, by 'the means,' i.e. a sacrificial animal and
the like required by one who is engaged in performing a sacred duty,
i.e. a Pa*s*ubandha-sacrifice and the like.

<span id="fn_1347"></span>[273:25](sbe0282.htm#fr_1348) Manu XI, 12.
26-27. Manu XI, 14.

<span id="fn_1348"></span>[273:28](sbe0282.htm#fr_1349) Manu XI, 16;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 43-

<span id="fn_1349"></span>[273:30](sbe0282.htm#fr_1350) Manu XI, 7;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 43-44.

<span id="fn_1350"></span>[273:31](sbe0282.htm#fr_1351) Manu XI, 21-22.
Haradatta adds that a Brâhma*n*a who acts thus, must, of course, not be
punished.

<span id="fn_1351"></span>[274:32](sbe0282.htm#fr_1352) Haradatta refers
this Sûtra to the case where 'a sacrificial animal or other requisites
for a sacrifice are stolen from a Brâhma*n*a. It seems, however, more
probable that it refers to the duty of the king to prevent, by all means
in his power, a violation of the sacred duty to perform
*S*rauta-sacrifices, and that it is intended to prescribe that he is to
assist a man who is engaged in them and too poor to finish them.
