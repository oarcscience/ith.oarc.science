### CHAPTER X.

1\. (The lawful occupations common) to (all) twice-born men are studying
the (Veda), offering sacrifices (for their own sake), and giving
(alms). <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1](#fn_1087.md)

2\. Teaching, performing sacrifices for others, and receiving alms (are)
the additional (occupations) of a Brâhma*n*a. <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[2](#fn_1088.md)

3\. But the former (three) are obligatory (on him). <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[3](#fn_1089.md)

4\. Instruction in the Veda (may be given) without the above-mentioned
(vows and ceremonies) in case a teacher, blood relations, friends or
Gurus (receive it), and in case (the Veda) is exchanged for money or
learning. <span id="fr_1091"></span>[4](#fn_1090.md)

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

5\. Agriculture and trade (are) also (lawful for a Brâhma*n*a) provided
he does not do the work himself, <span id="fr_1092"></span>[5](#fn_1091.md)

6\. Likewise lending money at interest.

7\. To protect all created beings is the additional (occupation) of a
king, <span id="fr_1093"></span>[7](#fn_1092.md)

8\. And to inflict lawful punishments.

9\. He shall support (those) *S*rotriyas, (who are) Brâhma*n*as, <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[9](#fn_1093.md)

10\. And people unable to work, (even if they are) not Brâhma*n*as,

11\. And those who are free from taxes, <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[11](#fn_1094.md)

12\. And (needy) temporary students. <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[12](#fn_1095.md)

13\. And (to take) measures for ensuring victory (is another duty of a
king), <span id="fr_1097"></span>[13](#fn_1096.md)

14\. Especially when danger (from foes threatens the kingdom);

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

15\. And (to learn) the management of chariots and the use of the bow
(is a further duty of the king),

16\. As well as to stand firm in battle and not to turn back. <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[16](#fn_1097.md)

17\. No sin (is committed) by injuring or slaying (foes) in
battle, <span id="fr_1099"></span>[17](#fn_1098.md)

18\. Excepting those who have lost their horses, charioteers, or arms,
those who join their hands (in supplication), those who flee with flying
hair, those who sit down with averted faces, those who have climbed (in
flight) on eminences or trees, messengers, and those who declare
themselves to be cows or Brâhma*n*as.

19\. If another Kshatriya is supported by (the king), he shall follow
the same occupations as his (master).

20\. The victor shall receive the booty gained in battle. <span
id="fr_1100"></span>[20](#fn_1099.md)

21\. But chariots and animals used for riding (belong) to the king,

22\. And a preferential share, except when the booty has been gained in
single combat. <span id="fr_1101"></span>[22](#fn_1100.md)

23\. But the king shall equitably divide (all) other (spoils).

24\. Cultivators (must) pay to the king a tax <span
id="fr_1102"></span>[24](#fn_1101.md)

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

(amounting to) one-tenth, one-eighth, or one-sixth (of the produce).

25\. Some declare, that (there is a tax) also on cattle and gold, (viz.)
one-fiftieth (of the stock). <span id="fr_1103"></span>[25](#fn_1102.md)

26\. In the case of merchandise one-twentieth (must be paid by the
seller) as duty, <span id="fr_1104"></span>[26](#fn_1103.md)

27\. (And) of roots, fruits, flowers, medicinal herbs, honey, meat,
grass, and firewood one-sixtieth. <span
id="fr_1105"></span>[27](#fn_1104.md)

28\. For it is the duty (of the king) to protect the (tax-payers). <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[28](#fn_1105.md)

29\. But to (the collection of) these (taxes) he shall always pay
particular attention. <span id="fr_1107"></span>[29](#fn_1106.md)

30\. He shall live on the surplus. <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[30](#fn_1107.md)

31\. Each artisan shall monthly do one (day's) work (for the
king). <span id="fr_1109"></span>[31](#fn_1108.md)

32\. Hereby (the taxes payable by) those who <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[32](#fn_1109.md)

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

support themselves by personal labour have been explained,

33\. And (those payable by) owners of ships and carts.

34\. He for him must feed these (persons while they work).

35\. The merchants shall (each) give (every month one) article of
merchandise for less than the market value.

36\. Those who find lost (property) the owner of which is not (known),
shall announce it to the king. <span id="fr_1111"></span>[36](#fn_1110.md)

37\. The king shall cause it to be proclaimed (by the public crier), and
(if the owner does not appear) hold it in his custody for a year.

38\. Afterwards one-fourth (of the value goes) to the finder (and) the
remainder to the king.

39\. A (man becomes) owner by inheritance, purchase, partition, seizure,
or finding. <span id="fr_1112"></span>[39](#fn_1111.md)

40\. Acceptance is for a Brâhma*n*a an additional (mode of acquisition);

41\. Conquest for a Kshatriya;

42\. Gain (by labour) for a Vai*s*ya or *S*ûdra.

43\. Treasure-trove is the property of the king, <span
id="fr_1113"></span>[43](#fn_1112.md)

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

44\. Excepting (such as is found) by a Brâhma*n*a who lives according to
(the law). <span id="fr_1114"></span>[44](#fn_1113.md)

45\. Some declare, that a finder of a non-Brâhmanical caste even, who
announces (his find to the king), shall obtain one-sixth (of the value).

46\. Having recovered property stolen by thieves, he shall return it to
the owner; <span id="fr_1115"></span>[46](#fn_1114.md)

47\. Or (if the stolen property is not recovered) he shall pay (its
value) out of his treasury. <span id="fr_1116"></span>[47](#fn_1115.md)

48\. The property of infants must be protected until they attain their
majority or complete their studentship. <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[48](#fn_1116.md)

49\. The additional (occupations) of a Vai*s*ya are, agriculture, trade,
tending cattle, and lending money at interest. <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[49](#fn_1117.md)

50\. The *S*ûdra (belongs to) the fourth caste, which has one birth
(only). <span id="fr_1119"></span>[50](#fn_1118.md)

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

51\. For him also (are prescribed) truthfulness, meekness, and
purity. <span id="fr_1120"></span>[51](#fn_1119.md)

52\. Some (declare), that instead of sipping water, he shall wash his
hands and feet.

53\. (He shall also offer) the funeral oblations, <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[53](#fn_1120.md)

54\. Maintain those depending upon him,

55\. Live with his wife (only), <span id="fr_1122"></span>[55](#fn_1121.md)

56\. And serve the higher (castes). <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[56](#fn_1122.md)

57\. From them he shall seek to obtain his livelihood. <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[57](#fn_1123.md)

58\. (He shall use their) cast-off shoes, umbrellas, garments, and mats
(for sitting on), <span id="fr_1125"></span>[58](#fn_1124.md)

59\. (And) eat the remnants of their food;

60\. And (he may) live by (practising) mechanical arts; <span
id="fr_1126"></span>[60](#fn_1125.md)

61\. And the Ârya under whose protection he places himself, must support
him even if he (becomes) unable to work.

62\. And a man of higher caste (who is his master and has fallen into
distress must be maintained) by him.

63\. His hoard shall serve this purpose.

64\. If permission has been given to him, he

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

may use the exclamation nama*h* (adoration) as his Mantra.

65\. Some (declare), that he himself may offer the Pâkaya*gñ*as. <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[65](#fn_1126.md)

66\. And all men must serve those who belong to higher castes.

67\. If Âryans and non-Âryans interchange their occupations and conduct
(the one taking that of the other, there is) equality (between
them). <span id="fr_1128"></span>[67](#fn_1127.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[227:1](sbe0274.htm#fr_1088.md) **X**. Twice-born
men, i.e. Brâhma*n*as, Kshatriyas, and Vai*s*yas. Haradatta says that
some believe the term 'twice-born' to have been used in order to
indicate that the three occupations may be lawfully followed after the
second birth, i.e. the initiation only. But he declares that alms may be
given even by an uninitiated Âryan, while studying the Veda and
sacrificing are specially forbidden to him.

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[227:2](sbe0274.htm#fr_1089.md) Âpastamba II, 5,
10, 4.

<span id="fn_1089"></span>[227:3](sbe0274.htm#fr_1090.md) Manu X, 76. The
former, i.e. the three beginning with studying (Sûtra 1), must
necessarily be followed. If he neglects them, he commits sin; if he
follows them, he will be exalted. But the other occupations, teaching,
&c., shall be followed if there is occasion for them. No sin is
committed by neglecting them, nor any greatness gained by following
them. They are merely means of livelihood.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1090"></span>[227:4](sbe0274.htm#fr_1091.md) Âpastamba I, 4,
13, 15-18. The expression 'above-mentioned' refers to the whole of the
rules regarding a pupil's conduct given above, I, 52-II, 51. It is
difficult to understand what is intended by 'the exchange of the Veda
for wealth or money,' if it is not the bh*ri*takâdhyâpana or teaching
for money which Manu III, 156 blames so severely. It seems to me
unlikely that Gautama means simply to sanction this practice. It is more
probable that his rule refers to the case of Brâhma*n*as in distress,
who avail themselves of the permission given above, VII, 4.

<span id="fn_1091"></span>[228:5](sbe0274.htm#fr_1092.md)-6. These rules
which allow Brâhma*n*as to be gentlemen farmers and sleeping partners in
mercantile or banking firms, managed by Vai*s*yas, do not occur in other
Sm*ri*tis. But they agree with the practice followed at present in many
parts of India, and the praise bestowed in Vedic works on those who
present land to Brâhma*n*as as well as the numerous ancient land grants
show that from early times many Brâhma*n*as were holders of land, which,
as a rule, was cultivated by *S*ûdras.

<span id="fn_1092"></span>[228:7](sbe0274.htm#fr_1093.md)-8. Âpastamba II,
5, 10, 6; Manu VII, 27.

<span id="fn_1093"></span>[228:9](sbe0274.htm#fr_1094.md) Âpastamba II, 10,
25, 11; Manu VII, 135.

<span id="fn_1094"></span>[228:11](sbe0274.htm#fr_1095.md) Haradatta takes
this Sûtra differently. He says: 'The immunity from taxes which has been
granted to Brâhma*n*as and others by former kings he shall maintain in
the same manner as formerly! But I think that 'akara' must be taken as a
Bahuvrîhi compound, and is used to designate widows, orphans, ascetics,
&c.; see Âpastamba II, 10, 26, 10-7.

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[228:12](sbe0274.htm#fr_1096.md) Haradatta
observes that others explain upakurvâ*n*a, 'temporary students,' opposed
to naish*th*ika, 'permanent students,' to mean 'men who benefit the
people,' i.e. physicians and the like.

<span id="fn_1096"></span>[228:13](sbe0274.htm#fr_1097.md) Manu III,
103-110, 160-200; X, 119.

<span id="fn_1097"></span>[229:16](sbe0274.htm#fr_1098.md) Manu VII, 87-89;
X, 119; Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 233.

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[229:17](sbe0274.htm#fr_1099.md)-18. Âpastamba
II, 5, 10, 11. Persons who declare themselves to be cows or Brâhma*n*as
become inviolable on account of the sacred character of the beings they
personate. Historical instances are narrated where conquered kings were
forced to appear before their victors, holding grass in their mouths or
dancing like peacocks in order to save their lives.

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[229:20](sbe0274.htm#fr_1100.md) Manu VII, 96.

<span id="fn_1100"></span>[229:22](sbe0274.htm#fr_1101.md)-23. Manu VII,
97.

<span id="fn_1101"></span>[229:24](sbe0274.htm#fr_1102.md) Manu VII, 130.
The amount depends on the nature of the soil and the manner of
cultivation.

<span id="fn_1102"></span>[230:25](sbe0274.htm#fr_1103.md) Manu VII, 130.
The above translation follows Haradatta's explanation, while Sir W.
Jones' rendering of Manu gives a different meaning to the identical
words.

<span id="fn_1103"></span>[230:26](sbe0274.htm#fr_1104.md) Manu VII, 127.

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[230:27](sbe0274.htm#fr_1105.md) Manu X, 120.

<span id="fn_1105"></span>[230:28](sbe0274.htm#fr_1106.md) Manu VII, 128.

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[230:29](sbe0274.htm#fr_1107.md) Manu VII, 128,
139.

<span id="fn_1107"></span>[230:30](sbe0274.htm#fr_1108.md) Haradatta takes
this Sûtra differently. He says, 'Adhika, "additional," means the money
which is paid on account of (the additional occupations) which have been
explained above (Sûtra 7 seq.) "To protect all created beings," &c.
Thereon shall he live, he himself, his servants, his elephants, horses,
and his other (animals).' If this explanation is adopted, the Sûtra
ought to be translated thus, 'He shall live on (the taxes paid for his)
additional (occupations).' It seems, however, more probable that Gautama
means to say that the king shall live on the surplus which remains after
providing for the external and internal security of the kingdom, and
that his object is to forbid the application of the whole revenue to the
personal expenses of the ruler.

<span id="fn_1108"></span>[230:31](sbe0274.htm#fr_1109.md) Manu VII, 131.

<span id="fn_1109"></span>[230:32](sbe0274.htm#fr_1110.md) Haradatta says
that wood-carriers, dancers, and the like are intended.

<span id="fn_1110"></span>[231:36](sbe0274.htm#fr_1111.md)-38. Manu VIII,
30-36; Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 33, 173; Macnaghten, Mitâksharâ I, 1, 6.

<span id="fn_1111"></span>[231:39](sbe0274.htm#fr_1112.md) Manu X, 115;
Mayûkha IV, 1, 2; Colebrooke, Mitâksharâ I, 1, 8; III, Digest IV, 22.
'Partition, i.e., the division (of the estate) between brothers and
other (coparceners); seizure, i.e. the appropriation before (others) of
forest trees and other things which have no owner; finding, i.e. the
appropriation of lost property the owner of which is unknown, such as
treasure-trove.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[231:43](sbe0274.htm#fr_1113.md) Manu VIII, 38;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 34; Macnaghten, Mitâksharâ V, 1, 10.

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[232:44](sbe0274.htm#fr_1114.md) Manu VIII, 37;

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[232:49](sbe0274.htm#fr_1118.md) Âpastamba II, 5,
10, 7.

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[232:50](sbe0274.htm#fr_1119.md) Âpastamba I, 1,
1, 6; Manu X, 4. Between this Sûtra and the next, my MSS. insert an
additional one, not found in Professor Stenzler's edition, *S*ûdrasyâpi
nishekapu*m*savanasîmantonnayana*g*âtakarmanâmakara*n*opanishkrama*n*ânnaprâ*s*ana*k*aulânyamantrakâ*n*i
yathâkâlam upadish*t*ânî*t*i, 'for the *S*ûdra also the Nisheka (or
impregnation), the Pu*m*savana (or rite for securing male offspring),
the Sîmantonnayana (or arranging the parting of a pregnant wife), the
*G*âtakarman (or ceremony on the birth of the child), the name-giving,
the first walk in the open air, the first feeding, and the *K*aula (or
tonsure of the child's head) are prescribed to be performed at the
proper periods, but without the recitation of sacred texts.' But I am
inclined to consider it spurious: first, because there is no proper
commentary; secondly, because the enumeration of the Sa*m*skâras given
here does not agree with <span id="page_233">p. 233</span> that given
above, VIII, 14; and thirdly, because, according to the practice of
Gautama, this Sûtra should begin with 'tasyâpi' instead of with
'Sûdrasyâpi,' and the 'tasyâpi' in the next would become superfluous.
The rule agrees however with Manu X, 63, 127.

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[233:51](sbe0274.htm#fr_1120.md) Manu IX, 335.

<span id="fn_1120"></span>[233:53](sbe0274.htm#fr_1121.md) Manu X, 127-128.

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[233:55](sbe0274.htm#fr_1122.md) 'Another
commentator explains the Sûtra to mean that he shall live with his wife
only, and never enter another order (i.e. never become a student,
hermit, or ascetic).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[233:56](sbe0274.htm#fr_1123.md) Âpastamba, I, 1,
1, 7-8; Manu X, 121-123.

Regarding the Pâkaya*gñ*as, see above, VIII, 18.

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[234:67](sbe0274.htm#fr_1128.md) 'There is
equality between them, i.e. the one need not serve the other. A *S*ûdra
need not serve even a Brâhma*n*a, (much less) any other (twice-born man)
who lives the life of a non-Âryan (*S*ûdra). A *S*ûdra, even, who
conducts himself like an 'Âryan must not be despised by men of other
castes, who follow the occupations of non-Âryans, on account of his
inferior birth.'--Haradatta.
