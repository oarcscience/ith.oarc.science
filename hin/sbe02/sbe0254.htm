<p>3. A vessel of brass, the centre of which is gilt, is best (for this occasion).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_712"></A><A HREF="sbe0254.htm#fr_713">149:4</A> If the masculine bhoktavya<I>h</I> is used instead of bhoktavyam, the participle must be construed with <I>k</I>amasa<I>h</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_713"></A><A HREF="sbe0254.htm#fr_714">149:5</A> The verbum finitum, which according to the Sanskrit text ought to be taken with the participle sa<I>m</I>nayan, is gras&icirc;ta, S&ucirc;tra 9.</P>

But according to the maxim that "restrictions are made on account of the continuance of an action once begun," the meaning of this second S&ucirc;tra is that he shall <A NAME="page_150"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 150</FONT></A> continue to the end to handle the vessel (in that manner in which) he has handled it when eating for the first time.'--Haradatta.</P>
