### Footnotes

<span id="fn_341"></span>[54:1](sbe0218.htm#fr_342) **15**. Taitt. Âr.
II, 1, 2 seq.; Manu IV, 58.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[54:2](sbe0218.htm#fr_343) Pure water is that
which a cow will drink. Yâ*gñ*. I, 192; Manu V, 128.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[54:3](sbe0218.htm#fr_344) The ceremony of
'sipping water' may be performed in two ways; either the 'person
sipping' may take the water out of a river, pond, &c., or he may get the
water poured into his hand by another person. But, according to
Âpastamba, he must not take a pot or gourd in his left hand and pour the
water into his right, as some Sm*ri*tis allow. The reason for this rule
is, that Âpastamba considers it essential that both hands should be used
in conveying the water to the mouth; see also above, I, 1, 4, 21. This
agrees with the custom now followed, which is to bend the right hand
into the form of a cow's ear, and to touch the right wrist with the left
hand while drinking.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[55:4](sbe0218.htm#fr_345) 'Some think, that
this Sûtra is intended to forbid also the drinking of rain-water. Other
commentators declare that, according to this Sûtra, it is allowed to use
for "sipping" drops of water which fall from a vessel suspended by ropes
\[because the Sûtra emphatically excludes "rain-drops
only\].'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[55:6](sbe0218.htm#fr_346) Manu II, 61.
'Because the term "heated by fire" is used, there is no objection to
water heated by the rays of the sun. In the same manner the use of,
"hot" water only is usually forbidden in the Sm*ri*tis.'-- Haradatta.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[55:7](sbe0218.htm#fr_347) 'Because the phrase
"with empty hands" is used, he commits no fault if he raises his hand,
holding a stick or a clod. Some declare, that the term "touching water"
(rendered by "washing means "sipping water."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[55:11](sbe0218.htm#fr_348) The translation
given above is based on the interpretation of Haradatta, who considers
that Âpastamba holds 'crossing a river' to cause impurity. The natural
and probably the right interpretation, however, is that rejected by
Haradatta, 'But he shall sip water after having come out (of the river
or tank).'

<span id="fn_348"></span>[55:12](sbe0218.htm#fr_349) '"On the fire used
for Vedic or Smârta sacrifices or for household purposes.". . . Some
declare, that (the fuel need not be sprinkled with water) if used for
the kitchen fire.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[56:14](sbe0218.htm#fr_350) Haradatta's
commentary is of little use, and I am not quite certain that my
translation is correct.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[56:15](sbe0218.htm#fr_351) Manu V, 118.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[56:17](sbe0218.htm#fr_352) This second
proceeding is adopted in case the dog has touched the hands or the lower
parts of the body, as may be learnt by the comparison of a verse of
Manu.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[56:18](sbe0218.htm#fr_353) Manu IV, 142;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 155.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[56:20](sbe0218.htm#fr_354) Manu IV, 53.
Haradatta mentions other explanations of this Sûtra. Some say, that the
*S*rauta fire may be kindled by blowing, because that is ordained
particularly in the Vâ*g*asaneyaka, but that the domestic fire is not to
be treated so. Others again consider the rule absolute, and say, that a
hollow reed or bellows must be used for kindling the fire, lest drops of
saliva should fall upon it.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[56:21](sbe0218.htm#fr_355) Manu IV, 54.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[57:22](sbe0218.htm#fr_356) The last condition
mentioned in the Sûtra indicates, that the place must have a river or
tank, not wells only, as the purification by sipping water cannot be
performed without help, with water from wells.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[57:23](sbe0218.htm#fr_357) Manu V, 138.
