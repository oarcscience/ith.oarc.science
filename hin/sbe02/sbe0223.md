### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 7, KHA*ND*A 20.

1\. He shall not fulfil his sacred duties merely in order to acquire
these worldly objects (as fame, gain, and honour).

2\. For when they ought to bring rewards, (duties thus fulfilled) become
fruitless.

3\. (Worldly benefits) are produced as accessories (to the fulfilment of
the law), just as in the case of a mango tree, which is planted in order
to obtain fruit, shade and fragrance (are accessory advantages).

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

4\. But if (worldly advantages) are not produced, (then at least) the
sacred duties have been fulfilled.

5\. Let him not become irritated at, nor be deceived by the speeches of
hypocrites, of rogues, of infidels, and of fools.

6\. For Virtue and Sin do not go about and say, 'Here we are;' nor do
gods, Gandharvas, or Manes say (to men), 'This is virtue, that is sin.'

7\. But that is virtue, the practice of which wise men of the three
twice-born castes praise; what they blame, is sin. <span

8\. He shall regulate his course of action according to the conduct
which in all countries is unanimously approved by men of the three
twice-born castes, who have been properly obedient (to their teachers),
who are aged, of subdued senses, neither given to avarice, nor
hypocrites. <span id="fr_432"></span>[8](#fn_431.md)

9\. Acting thus he will gain both worlds.

10\. Trade is not lawful for a Brâhma*n*a.

11\. In times of distress he may trade in lawful merchandise, avoiding
the following (kinds), that are forbidden: <span
id="fr_433"></span>[11](#fn_432.md)

12\. (Particularly) men, condiments and liquids, colours, perfumes,
food, skins, heifers, substances <span id="fr_434"></span>[12](#fn_433.md)

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

used for glueing (such as lac), water, young cornstalks, substances from
which spirituous liquor may be extracted, red and black pepper, corn,
flesh, arms, and the hope of rewards for meritorious deeds.

13\. Among (the various kinds of) grain he shall especially not sell
sesamum or rice (except he have grown them himself). <span
id="fr_435"></span>[13](#fn_434.md)

14\. The exchange of the one of these (abovementioned goods) for the
other is likewise unlawful.

15\. But food (may be exchanged) for food, and slaves for slaves, and
condiments for condiments, and perfumes for perfumes, and learning for
learning. <span id="fr_436"></span>[15](#fn_435.md)

16\. Let him traffic with lawful merchandise which he has not bought,

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_430"></span>[72:7](sbe0223.htm#fr_431.md) **20**. The Sûtra is
intended to show how the law should be ascertained in difficult cases.
Haradatta quotes here the passage of Yâ*gñ*. I, 9, on Parishads, and
states that the plural âryâ*h* shows that three or four must be employed
to arrive at a decision. See also Manu XII, 108 seq.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[72:8](sbe0223.htm#fr_432.md) Manu I, 6.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[72:11](sbe0223.htm#fr_433.md) This Sûtra, which
specifies only one part of a Vai*s*ya's occupations as permissible for
Brâhma*n*as in distress, implies, according to Haradatta, that his other
occupations also, as well as those of a Kshatriya, are permissible. Manu
IV, 6; X, 82; Yâ*gñ*. III, 35.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[72:12](sbe0223.htm#fr_434.md) Manu X, 86-89;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 36-39.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[73:13](sbe0223.htm#fr_435.md) The exception
stated above, is given by Haradatta on the authority of Manu X, 90;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 39.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[73:15](sbe0223.htm#fr_436.md) From the permission
to exchange learning for learning, it may be known that it is not lawful
to sell it.'--Haradatta. Manu X, 94.
