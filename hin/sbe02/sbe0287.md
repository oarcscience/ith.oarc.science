### CHAPTER XXIII.

1\. They shall pour hot spirituous liquor into the mouth of a Brâhma*n*a
who has drunk such liquor; he will be purified after death. <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[1](#fn_1420)

2\. If he has drunk it unintentionally, (he shall drink) for three days
hot milk, clarified butter, and water, and (inhale hot) air. That
(penance is called the Tapta-)k*rikkh*ra. Afterwards he shall be again
initiated. <span id="fr_1422"></span>[2](#fn_1421)

3\. And (the same penance must be performed) for swallowing urine,
excrements, or semen,

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

4\. And (for eating) any part of a carnivorous beast, of a camel or of
an ass, <span id="fr_1423"></span>[4](#fn_1422)

5\. And of tame cocks or tame pigs.

6\. If he smells the fume (exhaled) by a man who has drunk spirituous
liquor, (he shall) thrice restrain his breath and eat clarified
butter, <span id="fr_1424"></span>[6](#fn_1423)

7\. Also, if he has been bitten by (one of the animals mentioned) above
(Sûtras 4-5). <span id="fr_1425"></span>[7](#fn_1424)

8\. He who has defiled the bed of his Guru shall extend himself on a
heated iron bed, <span id="fr_1426"></span>[8](#fn_1425)

9\. Or he shall embrace the red-hot iron image of a woman.

10\. Or he shall tear out his organ and testicles and, holding them in
his hands, walk straight towards the south-west, until he falls down
dead,

11\. He will be purified after death.

12\. (The guilt of him who has intercourse) with the wife of a friend, a
sister, a female belonging to the same family, the wife of a pupil, a
daughter-in-law, or with a cow, is as great as that of (him who violates
his Guru's) bed. <span id="fr_1427"></span>[12](#fn_1426)

13\. Some (declare, that the guilt of such a sinner is equal to) that of
a student who breaks the vow of chastity. <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[13](#fn_1427)

14\. A woman who commits adultery with a man <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[14](#fn_1428)

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

of lower caste the king shall cause to be devoured by dogs in a public
place.

15\. He shall cause the adulterer to be killed (also). <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[15](#fn_1429)

16\. (Or he shall punish him in the manner) which has been declared
(above). <span id="fr_1431"></span>[16](#fn_1430)

17\. A student who has broken the vow of chastity shall offer an ass to
Nir*ri*ti on a cross-road. <span id="fr_1432"></span>[17](#fn_1431)

18\. Putting on the skin of that (ass), with the hair turned outside,
and holding a red (earthen) vessel in his hands, he shall beg in seven
houses, proclaiming his deed.

19\. He will be purified after a year.

20\. For an involuntary discharge caused by fear or sickness, or
happening during sleep, and if for seven days the fire-oblations and
begging have been neglected, (a student) shall make an offering of
clarified <span id="fr_1433"></span>[20](#fn_1432)

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

butter or (place) two pieces of fuel (in the fire) reciting the two
(verses called) Retasya.

21\. Let him who was asleep when the sun rose remain standing during the
day, continent and fasting, and him who was asleep when the sun set
(remain in the same position) during the night, reciting the
Gâyatrî. <span id="fr_1434"></span>[21](#fn_1433)

22\. He who has looked at an impure (person), shall look at the sun and
restrain his breath (once). <span id="fr_1435"></span>[22](#fn_1434)

23\. Let him who has eaten forbidden food \[or swallowed impure
substances\], (fast until) his entrails are empty. <span

24\. (In order to attain that), he must entirely abstain from food at
least for three (days and) nights.

25\. Or (he becomes pure) after eating during seven (days and) nights
fruits that have become detached spontaneously, avoiding (all other
food).

26\. (If, he has eaten forbidden food mentioned above) before five-toed
animals, he must throw it up and eat clarified butter. <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[26](#fn_1436)

27\. For abuse, speaking an untruth, and doing injury, (he shall
practise) austerities for no longer period than three (days and)
nights. <span id="fr_1438"></span>[27](#fn_1437)

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

28\. If (the abuse) was merited, (he shall offer) burnt-oblations,
reciting (the Mantras) addressed to Varu*n*a and (the hymns) revealed by
Manu. <span id="fr_1439"></span>[28](#fn_1438)

29\. Some (declare, that) an untruth (spoken) at the time of marriage,
during dalliance, in jest or while (one suffers severe) pain is
venial. <span id="fr_1440"></span>[29](#fn_1439)

30\. But (that is) certainly not (the case) when (the untruth) concerns
a Guru.

31\. For if he lies in his heart only to a Guru regarding small matters
even, he destroys (himself), seven descendants, and seven ancestors.

32\. For intercourse with a female (of one) of the lowest castes, he
shall perform a K*rikkh*ra penance during one year. <span

same penance) during twelve (days and) nights.

the same penance) for three (days and) nights. <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[34](#fn_1441)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1420"></span>[287:1](sbe0287.htm#fr_1421) **XXIII**.
Âpastamba I, 9, 25, 3. Haradatta, remarks that other twice-born men also
must perform the same penance in case they drink liquor forbidden to
them, see above, II, 20 note. He also states that the offence must have
been committed intentionally and repeatedly in order to justify so
severe an expiation. Regarding the effect of the purification after
death, see above, XX, 16.

<span id="fn_1421"></span>[287:2](sbe0287.htm#fr_1422)-3. Manu XI, 151;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 255; see also Âpastamba I, 9, 25, 10.

<span id="fn_1422"></span>[288:4](sbe0287.htm#fr_1423)-5. Manu XI, 157.

<span id="fn_1423"></span>[288:6](sbe0287.htm#fr_1424) Manu XI, 150.

<span id="fn_1424"></span>[288:7](sbe0287.htm#fr_1425) Manu XI, 200;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 277.

<span id="fn_1425"></span>[288:8](sbe0287.htm#fr_1426)-10. Âpastamba I,
9, 25, 1-2. Haradatta asserts that Guru denotes here the father alone.

<span id="fn_1426"></span>[288:12](sbe0287.htm#fr_1427) Manu XI,
171-172; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 232-233.

<span id="fn_1427"></span>[288:13](sbe0287.htm#fr_1428) 'The penance
also consists in the performance of the rites obligatory on an unchaste
student (see Sûtras 17-19), and that for the violation of a Guru's bed
need not be performed.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1428"></span>[288:14](sbe0287.htm#fr_1429) Manu VIII, 371.

<span id="fn_1429"></span>[289:15](sbe0287.htm#fr_1430) Manu VIII, 372;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 286; Âpastamba II, 10, 27, 9. My best MSS. read
ghâtayet, 'shall cause to be killed,' instead of Professor Stenzler's
khâdayet, 'shall cause to be devoured.' C. has khâdayet, but its
commentary, as well as that given in the other MSS., shows that ghâtayet
is the correct reading. The text of the commentary runs as follows:
Anantaroktavishaye gata*h* pumân râ*gñ*â ghâtayitvyo \[khâdayitavyo C.\]
vadhaprakâra*sk*ânantaram eva vasish*th*ava*k*ane dar*s*ita*h*. The
passages of Vasish*th*a XXI, 1-3, which Haradatta has quoted in
explanation of Sûtra 14, prescribe that the adulterer is to be burnt.
Another objection to the reading khâdayet is that the word would be
superfluous. If Gautama had intended to prescribe the same punishment
for the adulterer as for the woman, he would simply have said
pumâ*m*sam.

<span id="fn_1430"></span>[289:16](sbe0287.htm#fr_1431) Above, i.e. XII,
2, where the mutilation of the offender has been prescribed. See also
Âpastamba II, 10, 26, 20.

<span id="fn_1431"></span>[289:17](sbe0287.htm#fr_1432)-19. Âpastamba I,
9, 2 6, 8-9.

<span id="fn_1432"></span>[289:20](sbe0287.htm#fr_1433) Manu II, 181,
187; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 278, 281. The Retasyâs are found Taittirîya
Âra*n*yaka I, 30.

<span id="fn_1433"></span>[290:21](sbe0287.htm#fr_1434) Âpastamba II,
5,12, 22; Manu II, 220.

<span id="fn_1434"></span>[290:22](sbe0287.htm#fr_1435) Manu V, 86. 'An
impure person, i.e. a *K*â*nd*âla and the like. This rule refers to a
student (who sees such a person) while he recites the Veda.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1435"></span>[290:23](sbe0287.htm#fr_1436)-24. Âpastamba I,
9, 27, 3-4. My copies omit amedhyaprâ*s*ane vâ, or has swallowed impure
substances, and the words are not required, as another penance has been
prescribed for the case above, Sûtra 3. But see also Sâmavidhâna I, 5,
13.

<span id="fn_1436"></span>[290:26](sbe0287.htm#fr_1437) Manu XI, 161.
The Sûtras referred to are XVII, 9-26.

<span id="fn_1437"></span>[290:27](sbe0287.htm#fr_1438) Âpastamba I, 9,
26, 3. My copies read trirâtraparamam instead of trirâtram paramam. This
reading, which seems preferable, <span id="page_291">p. 291</span> is
also confirmed by the commentary, where the words are explained,
trirâtraparatayâ pare*n*a trirâtram.

<span id="fn_1438"></span>[291:28](sbe0287.htm#fr_1439) According to
Haradatta the texts addressed to Varu*n*a are yatki*m* *k*edam, Taitt.
Sa*m*h. III, 4, 11, 6; imam me varu*n*a, tattvâ yâmi, Taitt. Sa*m*h. II,
i, 11, 6; and ava te he*l*o, Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 5, 11, 3. The hymns seen
by Manu are Rig-veda VIII, 27-31.

<span id="fn_1439"></span>[291:29](sbe0287.htm#fr_1440) Manu VII, 112.

<span id="fn_1440"></span>[291:32](sbe0287.htm#fr_1441) Âpastamba I, 10,
28, 10-11. Regarding the K*rikkh*ra penance, see below, chapter XXVI.

<span id="fn_1441"></span>[291:34](sbe0287.htm#fr_1442) Manu XI, 174;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 288.
