<p>8. Each mouthful of food must be consecrated by the mental recitations (of one) of the following (words): Om, bh&ucirc;<I>h</I>, bhuva<I>h</I>, sva<I>h</I>, austerity, truth, fame, prosperity, vigour, refreshment, strength, lustre, soul, law, Siva.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1476"></A><A HREF="#fn_1475"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1471"></A><A HREF="sbe0291.htm#fr_1472">300:3</A> 'He calls penance vrata.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1472"></A><A HREF="sbe0291.htm#fr_1473">300:5</A> The four religious acts, the first of which is the offering of libations, are to be performed with the help of the three sacred texts, the first of which begins "Increase." As the number (of the acts and of the verses) does not agree, the fire-oblations and the libations of water must be performed severally, each with one text, and the consecration (of the offerings) and the worship (of the moon must be performed with all of them) together.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1473"></A><A HREF="sbe0291.htm#fr_1474">300:6</A> 'He shall offer--as nothing is specified--clarified butter, with the first four <I>ri</I><I>k</I>as of the Anuv&acirc;ka 'Yad dev&acirc; devahe<I>d</I>anam.' Counting the three mentioned above (S&ucirc;tra 5), altogether seven oblations of clarified butter must be made.'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1474"></A><A HREF="sbe0291.htm#fr_1475">300:7</A> 'On completion of the oblations of clarified butter, he <A NAME="page_301"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 301</FONT></A> shall offer pieces of sacred fuel, reciting the eight sacred texts, which begin "Devak<I>ri</I>tasya," and have been mentioned above (XXV, 10). The word "completion" (anta) is merely a confirmation of something established, because (the place of the offering) is already fixed by the place of the rule. But others explain the word "ante" to mean "at the end of the <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a." The word "and" does not agree with their (opinion).'--Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1475"></A><A HREF="sbe0291.htm#fr_1476">301:8</A> Haradatta observes that on the days when the performer eats less than fifteen mouthfuls, the later mentioned texts must be left out, and that, while eating, the performer must employ the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;huti Mantras (&Acirc;pastamba II, 1, 1, 2 note). He concludes by giving the following prayoga for the performance of the ceremony: He places all the food in his dish, and consecrates it by the texts "Increase," &amp;c. Next he divides it into mouthfuls, and consecrates each successively with the word Om and the rest, and eats them, reciting the texts for the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;hutis.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1476"></A><A HREF="sbe0291.htm#fr_1477">301:9</A> Haradatta states that either of the two words may be used in consecrating all the mouthfuls, but that others think, both should be used.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1478"></A><A HREF="sbe0291.htm#fr_1479">301:11</A> The term 'sacrificial viands' denotes here, according to Haradatta, the food eaten by the performer, which, like that eaten by the performer of a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra, must be havishya, 'fit for an offering,' <A NAME="page_302"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 302</FONT></A> see above, XXVI, 2. Haradatta adds that, as a G<I>ri</I>hastha must not beg, the food obtained by begging must have been collected by his pupils, and that liquid food must be used for the expiation of the more serious offences.</P>
