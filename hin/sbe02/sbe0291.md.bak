### CHAPTER XXVII.

1\. Now, therefore, the *K*ândrâya*n*a (or lunar penance will be
described).

2\. The (general) rules prescribed for a K*rikkh*ra (are applicable) to
that. <span id="fr_1471"></span>[2](#fn_1470.md)

3\. (The hair must be) shaved, in case it (is performed as) a
penance. <span id="fr_1472"></span>[3](#fn_1471.md)

4\. He shall fast on the day preceding the full moon.

5\. And (he shall offer) libations (of water), oblations of clarified
butter, consecrate the sacrificial viands, and worship the moon,
reciting these (*rik*as), 'Increase' (Rig-veda I, 91, 17), 'May milk be
joined with thee' (Rig-veda I, 91, 18, and) 'Ever new' (Rig-veda X, 85,
19). <span id="fr_1473"></span>[5](#fn_1472.md)

6\. He shall offer (clarified butter), reciting the four (*rik*as
beginning) 'Yad devâ devahe*d*anam,' <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[6](#fn_1473.md)

7\. And at the end (of the offering of clarified <span
id="fr_1475"></span>[7](#fn_1474.md)

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

butter he shall offer) pieces of sacred fuel, reciting (the texts
beginning) 'Devak*ri*tasya.'

8\. Each mouthful of food must be consecrated by the mental recitations
(of one) of the following (words): Om, bhû*h*, bhuva*h*, sva*h*,
austerity, truth, fame, prosperity, vigour, refreshment, strength,
lustre, soul, law, Siva. <span id="fr_1476"></span>[8](#fn_1475.md)

9\. Or (he may consecrate) all (of them at once, saying), Adoration
svâhâ. <span id="fr_1477"></span>[9](#fn_1476.md)

10\. The size of a mouthful (shall be such) as not to cause a distortion
of the mouth (in swallowing it). <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[10](#fn_1477.md)

11\. The sacrificial viands are, boiled rice, food obtained by begging,
ground barley, grain separated from the husk, barley-gruel, vegetables,
milk, sour <span id="fr_1479"></span>[11](#fn_1478.md)

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

milk, clarified butter, roots, fruits, and water; (among these) each
succeeding one is preferable (to those enumerated earlier).

12\. He shall eat on the day of the full moon fifteen mouthfuls, and
during the dark half (of the month) daily diminish his portion by one
(mouthful). <span id="fr_1480"></span>[12](#fn_1479.md)

13\. He shall fast on the day of the new moon, and during the bright
half (of the month) daily increase (his portion) by one (mouthful).

14\. According to some (the order shall be) inverted. <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[14](#fn_1480.md)

15\. That (is called) a month, occupied by the *K*ândrâya*n*a penance.

16\. He who has completed that, becomes free from sin and free from
crime, and destroys all guilt.

17\. He who has completed a second (month, living according to that
rule), sanctifies himself, ten ancestors, and ten descendants, as well
as (any) company (to which he may be invited);

18\. And he who has lived for a year (according to that rule), dwells
(after death) in the world of the moon. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1470"></span>[300:2](sbe0291.htm#fr_1471.md) **XXVII**. The
rules meant particularly are those given XXVI, 6-11.

<span id="fn_1471"></span>[300:3](sbe0291.htm#fr_1472.md) 'He calls penance
vrata.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1472"></span>[300:5](sbe0291.htm#fr_1473.md) The four
religious acts, the first of which is the offering of libations, are to
be performed with the help of the three sacred texts, the first of which
begins "Increase." As the number (of the acts and of the verses) does
not agree, the fire-oblations and the libations of water must be
performed severally, each with one text, and the consecration (of the
offerings) and the worship (of the moon must be performed with all of
them) together.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1473"></span>[300:6](sbe0291.htm#fr_1474.md) 'He shall
offer--as nothing is specified--clarified butter, with the first four
*rik*as of the Anuvâka 'Yad devâ devahe*d*anam.' Counting the three
mentioned above (Sûtra 5), altogether seven oblations of clarified
butter must be made.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1474"></span>[300:7](sbe0291.htm#fr_1475.md) 'On completion of
the oblations of clarified butter, he <span id="page_301">p. 301</span>
shall offer pieces of sacred fuel, reciting the eight sacred texts,
which begin "Devak*ri*tasya," and have been mentioned above (XXV, 10).
The word "completion" (anta) is merely a confirmation of something
established, because (the place of the offering) is already fixed by the
place of the rule. But others explain the word "ante" to mean "at the
end of the *K*ândrâya*n*a." The word "and" does not agree with their
(opinion).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1475"></span>[301:8](sbe0291.htm#fr_1476.md) Haradatta
observes that on the days when the performer eats less than fifteen
mouthfuls, the later mentioned texts must be left out, and that, while
eating, the performer must employ the Prâ*n*âhuti Mantras (Âpastamba II,
1, 1, 2 note). He concludes by giving the following prayoga for the
performance of the ceremony: He places all the food in his dish, and
consecrates it by the texts "Increase," &c. Next he divides it into
mouthfuls, and consecrates each successively with the word Om and the
rest, and eats them, reciting the texts for the Prâ*n*âhutis.'

<span id="fn_1476"></span>[301:9](sbe0291.htm#fr_1477.md) Haradatta states
that either of the two words may be used in consecrating all the
mouthfuls, but that others think, both should be used.

<span id="fn_1477"></span>[301:10](sbe0291.htm#fr_1478.md) Yâ*gñ*avalkya
III, 324.

<span id="fn_1478"></span>[301:11](sbe0291.htm#fr_1479.md) The term
'sacrificial viands' denotes here, according to Haradatta, the food
eaten by the performer, which, like that eaten by the performer of a
K*rikkh*ra, must be havishya, 'fit for an offering,' <span
id="page_302">p. 302</span> see above, XXVI, 2. Haradatta adds that, as
a G*ri*hastha must not beg, the food obtained by begging must have been
collected by his pupils, and that liquid food must be used for the
expiation of the more serious offences.

<span id="fn_1479"></span>[302:12](sbe0291.htm#fr_1480.md) Manu XI,
2,7-218; Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 324-325.

<span id="fn_1480"></span>[302:14](sbe0291.htm#fr_1481.md) I.e. the
performer may begin with the fast on the day of the new moon.

<span id="fn_1481"></span>[302:18](sbe0291.htm#fr_1482.md) Manu XI, 221;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 327.
