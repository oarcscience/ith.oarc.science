### Footnotes

<span id="fn_759"></span>[163:1](sbe0261.htm#fr_760.md) **26**. Manu VII,
83, 84, 88; Yâ*gñ*. I, 314.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[163:2](sbe0261.htm#fr_761.md) According to
Haradatta the king's body represents the post (yûpa), his soul the
sacrificial animal, the recovered property the reward for the priests or
fee.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[163:3](sbe0261.htm#fr_762.md) Manu VII, 89;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 323, 324.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[163:4](sbe0261.htm#fr_763.md) Manu VII, 115-124;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 321.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[163:6](sbe0261.htm#fr_764.md) Yâ*gñ*. II,
271-272. A yo*g*ana is a distance of 4 kro*s*a, kos.

<span id="fn_764"></span>[163:7](sbe0261.htm#fr_765.md) A kro*s*a, kos, or
gâu, literally 'the lowing of a cow,' is variously reckoned at 1½-4
miles.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[163:8](sbe0261.htm#fr_766.md) Yâ*gñ*. I, 272.
This law is, with certain modifications, still in force. See Bombay
Regulations, XII, 27 par.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[164:9](sbe0261.htm#fr_767.md) According to
Haradatta, who quotes Gautama in his commentary, the *s*ulka is the
1/20th part of a merchant's gains. On account of the Sûtras immediately
following, it is, however, more probable that the term is here used as a
synonym of 'kara,' and includes all taxes. 'Lawful' taxes are, of
course, those sanctioned by custom and approved of by the Sm*ri*tis.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[164:10](sbe0261.htm#fr_768.md) Manu VII, 133.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[164:11](sbe0261.htm#fr_769.md) Haradatta thinks
that the rule applies to women of the Anuloma, the pure castes, only.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[164:14](sbe0261.htm#fr_770.md) 'Why does be say
"intent on fulfilling the holy law?" Those shall not be free from taxes
who perform austerities in order to make their magic charms
efficacious.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[164:18](sbe0261.htm#fr_771.md) The ornaments
would indicate that he was bent on mischief. Compare above, I, 11, 32,
6.

<span id="fn_771"></span>[165:19](sbe0261.htm#fr_772.md) 'The punishment
must be proportionate to his property and the greatness of his offence.
The term "with a bad purpose" is added, because he who has been sent by
his teacher (to such a place) should not be punished.'--Haradatta. Manu
VIII, 354; Yâ*gñ*. II, 284.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[165:24](sbe0261.htm#fr_773.md) 'I.e. a married
woman to her husband or father-in-law an unmarried damsel to her father
or to her brother.'--Haradatta.
