<span id="fn_331"></span>[52:13](sbe0217.htm#fr_332) Manu II, 134.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[52:16](sbe0217.htm#fr_333) This Sûtra, like
the preceding, refers to those who are not 'Gurus.'

<span id="fn_336"></span>[53:24](sbe0217.htm#fr_337) Âpastamba, of
course, holds the contrary opinion. Manu II, 216.

these terms I hope you have not lost any cattle or other
property!'--Haradatta.
