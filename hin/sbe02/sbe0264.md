### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 11, KHA*ND*A 29.

1\. He who instigates to, he who assists in, and he who commits (an act,
these three) share its rewards in heaven and its punishments in hell.

2\. He amongst these who contributes most to the accomplishment (of the
act obtains) a greater share of the result.

3\. Both the wife and the husband have power over (their) common
property. <span id="fr_786"></span>[3](#fn_785.md)

4\. By their permission, others also may act for their good (in this and
the next world, even by spending money). <span
id="fr_787"></span>[4](#fn_786.md)

5\. Men of learning and pure descent, who are aged, clever in reasoning,
and careful in fulfilling the duties (of their caste and order, shall be
the judges) in lawsuits. <span id="fr_788"></span>[5](#fn_787.md)

6\. In doubtful cases (they shall give their decision) after having
ascertained (the truth) by inference, ordeals, and the like
(means). <span id="fr_789"></span>[6b](#fn_788.md)

7\. A person who is possessed of good qualities (may be called as a
witness, and) shall answer the questions put to him according to the
truth on an auspicious day, in the morning, before a kindled fire,
standing near (a jar full of) water, in the presence of the king, and
with the consent of all (of both parties and of the assessors), after
having been exhorted (by the judge) to be fair to both sides. <span
id="fr_790"></span>[7](#fn_789.md)

8\. If (he is found out speaking) an untruth, the king shall punish
him. <span id="fr_791"></span>[8](#fn_790.md)

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

9\. Besides, in that case, after death, hell (will be his
punishment). <span id="fr_792"></span>[9](#fn_791.md)

10\. If he speaks the truth, (his reward will be) heaven and the
approbation of all created beings. <span
id="fr_793"></span>[10](#fn_792.md)

11\. The knowledge which *S*ûdras and women possess is the completion
(of all study). <span id="fr_794"></span>[11](#fn_793.md)

12\. They declare, that (this knowledge) is a supplement of the
Atharva-Veda.

13\. It is difficult to learn the sacred law from (the letter of) the
Vedas (only); but by following the indications it is easily
accomplished.

14\. The indications for these (doubtful cases are), 'He shall regulate
his course of action according to the conduct which is unanimously
recognised in all countries by men of the three twice-born castes, who
have been properly obedient (to their teachers), who are aged, of
subdued senses, neither given to avarice, nor hypocrites. Acting thus he
will gain both worlds.' <span id="fr_795"></span>[14](#fn_794.md)

15\. Some declare, that the remaining duties (which have not been taught
here) must be learnt from women and men of all castes.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[169:3](sbe0264.htm#fr_786.md) **29**. 'Though
this is so, still the wife cannot spend (money) without the permission
of her husband, but the husband can do (so without the consent of his
wife). That may be known by Sûtra II, 6, 14, 11, "They do not declare it
to be a theft if the wife spends money for a good reason during the
absence of her husband."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[169:4](sbe0264.htm#fr_787.md) 'Others, i.e. the
sons and the rest.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[169:6b](sbe0264.htm#fr_789.md) 'And the like,
i.e. by cross-examination, &c.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[170:11](sbe0264.htm#fr_794.md) Manu II, 223. The
meaning of the Sûtra is, that men ought not to study solely or at first
such *S*âstras as women or *S*ûdras also learn, but that at first they
must study the Veda. See Manu II, 168. The knowledge which women and
*S*ûdras possess is dancing, music, and other branches of the
Artha*s*âstra.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[170:14](sbe0264.htm#fr_795.md) See above, I, 7,
20, 8 and 9.
