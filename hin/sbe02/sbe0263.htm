<P><A NAME="fn_780"></A><A HREF="sbe0263.htm#fr_781">168:1</A> <b>28</b>. This S&ucirc;tra shows that the system of leasing land against a certain share of the crops, which now prevails generally in Native States, and is not uncommon in private contracts on British territory, was in force in &Acirc;pastamba's times.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_781"></A><A HREF="sbe0263.htm#fr_782">168:2</A> See Colebrooke, Digest, Book III, Text lxviii, for this S&ucirc;tra and the following two. Another commentator, quoted by Haradatta, connects this S&ucirc;tra with the preceding, and refers it to a poor lessee of land, who cannot pay the value of the crop which was lost through his negligence. A third explanation refers the S&ucirc;tra to a cultivator who neglects to till his land. <I>G</I>agann&acirc;tha's authorities, the <I>K</I>int&acirc;ma<I>n</I>i and Ratn&acirc;kara, agree with Haradatta's first explanation.</P>
