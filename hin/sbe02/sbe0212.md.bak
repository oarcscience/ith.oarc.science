the throw of a Samyâ. <span id="fr_249"></span>[6](#fn_248.md)

10\. Some declare, that (one ought to avoid only, to study) in the same

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_244"></span>[32:1](sbe0212.htm#fr_245.md) **9**. The Upâkarma
is the ceremony which is performed every year at the beginning of the
course of study. It is in fact the solemn opening of the Brahmanic term.
'Because Âpastamba uses the word evening (i.e. first part of the night)
it is not sinful to study later in the night.'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 95;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 142, 143; Weber, Ind. Stud. X. 130 and 134.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[33:2](sbe0212.htm#fr_246.md) The term lasts
therefore for five months; (i.e. latter half of, Srâva*n*a, Bhârapada,
Â*s*vina, Kârttika, Mârgasîrsha, and the first half of Pausha.) The
Rohinî-day of Pausha is meant.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[33:3](sbe0212.htm#fr_247.md) 'According to this
latter opinion the Upâkarma should be performed on the full moon of
Bhâdrapada, as has been taught in another work (Manu IV, 95); the (time
of the) Utsargana, (the solemn closing of the term) should be advanced;
and after the Utsargana has been performed, one may study the Veda
during the light nights of each month until the full moon of Srâva*n*a,
in order to fix in one's mind the part learned already; and in the dark
fortnight of each month one may study the Vedâṅgas, i.e. grammar and the
rest (Manu IV, 98). On the full moon of Srâva*n*a the Upâkarma should be
performed once more, and that part of the Veda should be studied which
has not yet been learned.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[33:4](sbe0212.htm#fr_248.md) Nigarnâh,
'high-roads,' are squares and the like.--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[33:6](sbe0212.htm#fr_249.md) The Samyâ is either
the pin in the bullock's yoke or the round stick, about a foot and a
half in length, which is used for the preparation of the Vedi. Manu IV,
116; Yâ*gñ*. I, 148.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[33:8](sbe0212.htm#fr_250.md) 'Nor anywhere near
it within the throw of a Samyi.' This must be understood from. Sûtra 6.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[34:9](sbe0212.htm#fr_251.md) Yâ*gñ*. I, 148.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[34:13](sbe0212.htm#fr_252.md) The last part of
the Sûtra may also be interpreted: 'Thus she will be blessed with
children.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[34:14](sbe0212.htm#fr_253.md) Manu IV, 108;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 148.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[34:18](sbe0212.htm#fr_254.md) Haradatta explains
Bâhya, 'outcasts,' by 'robbers, such as Ugras and Nishâdas.' But, I
think, it means simply such outcasts as live in the forest or outside
the village in the Vâdî, like the Dhers, Mahârs, Mângs of the present
day. Most of these tribes however, are or were given to thieving. See
Kullûka on Manu X, 2 9, and the Petersburg Dict. s. v.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[35:19](sbe0212.htm#fr_255.md) Yâ*gñ*. I, 150.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[35:20](sbe0212.htm#fr_256.md) Manu IV, 106;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 145. This rule refers to the rainy season. (For thunder) at
other (seasons) he orders below a longer (cessation).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[35:27](sbe0212.htm#fr_257.md) Manu IV, 120;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 151.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[35:28](sbe0212.htm#fr_258.md) '"For two days,"
i.e. on the day of the new moon and the preceding one, the fourteenth of
the half month.'--Haradatta. Manu IV, 113; Yâ*gñ*. I, 146.
