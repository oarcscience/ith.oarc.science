<P><A NAME="fn_526"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_527">99:1</A> <b>1</b>. According to Haradatta, this rule is intended to refute the opinion of those who hold that the sacred household-fire may be kept, and the prescribed offerings therein may be performed, either from the time of the marriage, or after the division of the family estate. He also states that the use of the dual g<I>ri</I>hamedhino<I>h</I> indicates that husband and wife must perform the rites conjointly. Manu III, 67.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_527"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_528">99:2</A> Haradatta thinks that this S&ucirc;tra is intended to prevent householders from having more than two meals a day, and to keep them from gluttony. Others are of opinion that its object is to keep householders from excessive fasting, and to make them perform the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;gnihotra at either meal. At the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;gnihotra the sacrificer eats five mouthfuls invoking successively, whilst he <A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A> eats, the five vital airs. At the first mouthful he says, 'To Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a sv&acirc;h&acirc;;' at the second, 'To Ap&acirc;na sv&acirc;h&acirc;,' &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_528"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_529">100:5</A> &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. G<I>ri</I>. S&ucirc;. I, 10, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_529"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_530">100:7</A> Haradatta holds that the words 'on that day' do not refer to the days of the new and full moon, the Parvan-days, mentioned in S&ucirc;tra 4. His reasons are, first, that the permission to eat food, of which the householder may be particularly fond, has already been given in S&ucirc;tra 6, by the term t<I>ri</I>pi<I>h</I>, 'satisfaction'; and, secondly, that the singular 'on this day' does not agree with the plural 'on the Parvan-days.' Hence he comes to the conclusion that the words 'on that day' must refer to the wedding-day, mentioned in S&ucirc;tra 1, as well as to its anniversary. Haradatta is, probably, right in his explanation, though the reasons adduced here are very weak. A stronger reason for detaching this S&ucirc;tra from S&ucirc;tra 4 will be brought forward below, under S&ucirc;tra 11. Mah&acirc;deva, the commentator of the Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>idharma, adopts the view rejected by Haradatta.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_530"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_531">100:8</A> &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. G<I>ri</I>. S&ucirc;. I, 3, 10.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_531"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_532">100:10</A> A Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka is an offering at which rice cooked in a pot, sth&acirc;l&icirc;, is offered in the fire. A full description of this kind of sacrifice occurs, &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. G<I>ri</I>. S&ucirc;. I, 10, 1 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_532"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_533">100:11</A> The P&acirc;rva<I>n</I>a Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka has been described by &Acirc;pastamba <A NAME="page_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A> in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, III, 7. Again, Haradatta returns to the question whether the words on that day (S&ucirc;tra 7) refer to the Parvan-days, or the marriage-day and its anniversaries. He now adds, in favour of the latter view, that the word P&acirc;rva<I>n</I>ena, 'by the rite to be performed on Parvan-days,' by which the Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka on Parvan-days is intended, clearly proves the impossibility to refer he preceding rules to the Parvan-days. He adds that some, nevertheless, adopt the explanation rejected by himself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_533"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_534">101:12</A> They, i.e. the <I>S</I>ish<I>t</I>as, those learned in the law. 'Another commentator says, the rite which will be taught (in the following S&ucirc;tra), and which is known from the usage of the learned, is constant, i.e. must be performed in every case. That it is what the "learned" declare.'--Haradatta. The latter explanation of the S&ucirc;tra is adopted by Mah&acirc;deva.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_534"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_535">101:13</A> &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. G<I>ri</I>. S&ucirc;. I, 3, 1-3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_535"></A><A HREF="sbe0236.htm#fr_536">101:15</A> Haradatta states that the object of the repetition of the words 'the householder and his wife' is to show that they themselves must fill the water-vessels, and not employ others for this purpose. He adds that, according to another commentator, the object of the repetition is to show that S&ucirc;tras 13 and 14 apply not only to householders, but also to students, and that hence students, when they offer the daily oblations of sacred fuel (above, I, 1, 4, 14 seq.), should also perform the rites taught in the preceding S&ucirc;tras.</P>
