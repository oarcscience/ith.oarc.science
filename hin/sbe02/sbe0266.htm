<P><A NAME="fn_847"></A><A HREF="sbe0266.htm#fr_848">185:1</A> <b>II</b>. In concluding the explanation of this S&ucirc;tra, Haradatta states that its last clause is intended to give an instance of the freedom of behaviour permitted to a child. In his opinion Gautama indicates thereby that a person who, before initiation, drinks spirituous liquor, commits murder or other mortal sins, becomes an outcast, and is liable to perform the penances prescribed for initiated sinners. In support of this view be quotes a passage, taken from an unnamed Sm<I>ri</I>ti, according to which the parents or other relatives of children between five and eleven years are to perform penances vicariously for the latter, while children between eleven and fifteen years are declared to be liable to half the penances prescribed for initiated adults. Hence he infers that though the above text of Gautama speaks of uninitiated persons in general, its provisions really apply to children under five years of age only. Though it would seem that some of Gautama's rules refer to half-grown persons rather than to infants or very young boys, it is impossible to assume that Gautama meant to give full licence of behaviour, speech, and eating to Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as who were not <A NAME="page_186"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 186</FONT></A> initiated before their sixteenth year, or to Kshatriyas and Vai<I>s</I>yas up to the age of twenty and twenty-two. It seems more likely that, as Haradatta thinks, his rules are meant in the first instance for infants and very young children only, and that he intended the special cases of half-grown or nearly grown up boys to be dealt with according to the custom of the family or of the country.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_848"></A><A HREF="sbe0266.htm#fr_849">186:2</A> Haradatta points out that the S&ucirc;tra does not forbid uninitiated persons to sip water, but that it merely denies the applicability of the rules (kalpa) given above, I, 36. Uninitiated persons may, therefore, sip water in the manner practised by women and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras.</P>

Haradatta observes <A NAME="page_188"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 188</FONT></A> that, as Manu II, 102 prescribes the recitation of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; during the morning and evening devotions, either his or Gautama's rule may be followed.
