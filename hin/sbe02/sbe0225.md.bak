### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 8, KHA*ND*A 22.

1\. He shall employ the means which tend to the acquisition of (the
knowledge of) the Âtman, which are attended by the consequent
(destruction of the passions, and) which prevent the wandering (of the
mind from its object, and fix it on the contemplation of the
Âtman). <span id="fr_445"></span>[1](#fn_444.md)

2\. There is no higher (object) than the attainment of (the knowledge of
the) Âtman. <span id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_445.md)

3\. We shall quote the verses (from the Veda) <span
id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_446.md)

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

which refer to the attainment of (the knowledge of) the Âtman.

4\. All living creatures are the dwelling of him who lies enveloped in
matter, who is immortal and who is spotless. Those become immortal who
worship him who is immovable and lives in a movable dwelling. <span
id="fr_448"></span>[4](#fn_447.md)

5\. Despising all that which in this world is called an object (of the
senses) a wise man shall strive after the (knowledge of the)
Âtman. <span id="fr_449"></span>[5](#fn_448.md)

6\. O pupil, I, who had not recognised in my own self the great
self-luminous, universal, (absolutely) free Âtman, which must be
obtained without the mediation of anything else, desired (to find) it in
others (the senses). (But now as I have obtained the pure knowledge, I
do so no more.) Therefore follow thou also this good road that leads to
welfare (salvation), and not the one that leads into misfortune (new
births). <span id="fr_450"></span>[6](#fn_449.md)

7\. It is he who is the eternal part in all creatures, whose essence is
wisdom, who is immortal, unchangeable, destitute of limbs, of voice, of
the (subtle) body, <span id="fr_451"></span>[7](#fn_450.md)

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

(even) of touch, exceedingly pure; he is the universe, he is the highest
goal; (he dwells in the middle of the body as) the Vishuvat day is (the
middle of a Sattra-sacrifice); he, indeed, is (accessible to all) like a
town intersected by many streets.

8\. He who meditates on him, and everywhere and always lives according
to his (commandments), and who, full of devotion, sees him who is
difficult to be seen and subtle, will rejoice in (his) heaven. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_444"></span>[75:1](sbe0225.htm#fr_445.md) **22**. The
knowledge of the Vedânta and the means which prepare men for the
knowledge of the Âtman, the 'Self, the universal soul,' are placed in
this Pa*t*ala at the head of the penances, because they are most
efficacious for the removal of all sin. The means are absence of anger
&c., which are enumerated I, 8, 23, 6.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[75:2](sbe0225.htm#fr_446.md) Haradatta gives in
his commentary a lengthy discussion on the Âtman, which corresponds
nearly to *S*aṅkara's Introduction to and Commentary on the first Sûtra
of Bâdarâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[75:3](sbe0225.htm#fr_447.md) According to
Haradatta, the following verses are taken from an Upanishad.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[76:4](sbe0225.htm#fr_448.md) The spotless one &c.
is the Paramâtman. The spots are merit and demerit which, residing in
the Manas, the internal organ of perception, are only falsely attributed
to the Âtman, 'the soul.' To become immortal means 'to obtain final
liberation.'

<span id="fn_448"></span>[76:5](sbe0225.htm#fr_449.md) It seems to me that
Haradatta's explanation of the words 'idam idi ha idi ha' is wrong. They
ought to be divided thus, 'idamid, iha id, iha loke.' The general sense
remains the same, and there is no necessity to assume very curious and
otherwise unknown Vedic forms.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[76:6](sbe0225.htm#fr_450.md) The verse is
addressed by a teacher to his pupil. My translation strictly follows
Haradatta's gloss. But his interpretation is open to many doubts.
However, I am unable to suggest anything better.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[76:7](sbe0225.htm#fr_451.md) The Sutra contains a
further description of the Paramâtman.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[77:8](sbe0225.htm#fr_452.md) Haradatta explains
the word vish*t*ap, 'heaven,' by 'pain-freed greatness,' apparently
misled by a bad etymology. The heaven of the Âtman is, of course,
liberation, that state where the individual soul becomes merged in the
Brahman or Paramâtman, which is pure essence, intelligence and joy.
