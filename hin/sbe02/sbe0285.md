relatives of his mother and of his father (within six degrees) or with
sisters and their female offspring, he who steals (the gold of a
Brâhma*n*a), an atheist, he who constantly repeats blamable acts, he who
does not cast off persons guilty of a crime causing loss of caste, and
he who forsakes blameless (relatives), become outcasts, <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[1](#fn_1375)

2\. Likewise those who instigate others to acts causing loss of
caste, <span id="fr_1377"></span>[2](#fn_1376)

3\. And he who for a (whole) year associates with outcasts. <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[3](#fn_1377)

4\. To be an outcast means to be deprived of the right to follow the
lawful occupations of twice-born men,

5\. And to be deprived after death of the rewards of meritorious deeds.

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

6\. Some call (this condition) hell.

7\. Manu (declares, that) the first three (crimes, named above) cannot
be expiated. <span id="fr_1379"></span>[7](#fn_1378)

8\. Some (declare, that a man) does not become an outcast (by having
connection) with female (relatives), except (when he violates) a Guru's
bed. <span id="fr_1380"></span>[8](#fn_1379)

9\. A woman becomes an outcast by procuring abortion, by connection with
a (man of) lower (caste) and (the like heinous crimes). <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[9](#fn_1380)

10\. Giving false evidence, calumnies which will reach (the ears of) the
king, an untrue accusation brought against a Guru (are acts) equal to
mortal sins (mahâpâtaka). <span id="fr_1382"></span>[10](#fn_1381)

11\. (The guilt of a) minor offence (upapâtaka) rests on those who (have
been declared to) defile the company (at a funeral dinner and have been
named above) before the bald man, on killers of kine, those who forget
the Veda, those who pronounce Vedic texts for the (last-mentioned
sinners), students <span id="fr_1383"></span>[11](#fn_1382)

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

who break the vow of chastity, and those who allow the time for the
initiation to pass.

12\. An officiating priest must be forsaken, if he is ignorant (of the
rules of the sacrifice), a teacher, if he does not impart instruction,
and (both) if they commit crimes causing loss of caste. <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[12](#fn_1383)

13\. He who forsakes (them) under any other circumstances, becomes an
outcast.

14\. Some declare, that he, also, who receives (a person who has

15\. The mother and the father must not be treated improperly under any
circumstances. <span id="fr_1385"></span>[15](#fn_1384)

16\. But (the sons) shall not take their property. <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[16](#fn_1385)

17\. By accusing a Brâhma*n*a of a crime (the accuser commits) a sin
equal (to that of the accused). <span id="fr_1387"></span>[17](#fn_1386)

18\. If (the accused is) innocent, (the accuser's guilt is) twice (as
great as that of the crime which he imputed to the other). <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[18](#fn_1387)

19\. And he who, though able to rescue a weak man from injury, (does)
not (do it, incurs as much guilt as he who injures the other).

20\. He who in anger raises (his hand or a weapon) <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[20](#fn_1388)

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

against a Brâhma*n*a, will be banished from heaven for a hundred years.

21\. If he strikes, (he will lose heaven) for a thousand (years).

22\. If blood flows, (he will lose heaven) for a number of years equal
to (that of the particles of) dust which the spilt (blood) binds
together. <span id="fr_1390"></span>[22](#fn_1389)

similar crimes also. Another (commentator) says, "A woman who serves the
slayer of a learned Brâhma*n*a, or a man of lower caste, i.e. becomes
his wife, loses her caste. On account of the word 'and' the same happens
in case she kills a Brâhma*n*a or commits a similarly heinous crime. The

desertion of sinners has been prescribed above, XX, 1, the expression
patanîyasevâyâm must here mean 'if they associate with outcasts.' The
former rule refers, however, to blood relations only, and our Sûtra may
be intended to extend it to spiritual, relations.

heaven,' may either mean that a hundred years' residence in heaven will
