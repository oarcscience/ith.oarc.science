### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[218:1](sbe0273.htm#fr_1031.md) **IX**. Âpastamba
I, 11, 30. 1-4. Haradatta says that the expression sa, 'such (a man),'
refers to the king, and to the Brâhma*n*a deeply versed in the Vedas,
who have been described in the preceding chapter. My MSS. insert between
this and the following one another Sûtra, which has been left out in
Professor Stenzler's edition. It seems to me that it is absolutely
required, and I therefore insert it here, together with Haradatta's
comment, according to my best copy, P.

Gautama: '(And) a Snâtaka (i.e. a person who has completed his
studentship, but has not yet taken a wife, shall act thus).' Haradatta:
'It must be understood that the word "and" has been left <span
id="page_219">p. 219</span> out. (The meaning is): "And a Snâtaka shall
obey the following ordinances." If this Sûtra were not given, those
ordinances would have to be obeyed after marriage only; and if the
preceding Sûtra (1) had not been given, before marriage only, because
the term Snâtaka is usually employed in that (sense) only. For this
reason both (Sûtras) have been given. Hence, though a man may not enter
another order, he shall, after taking the bath (on completion of his
studentship), obey these ordinances during his whole life. As here
(Sûtra 1) the word sa, "such a man," is used, a Kshatriya and a
Brâhma*n*a only must necessarily obey the rules prescribed for a Snâtaka
and perform a penance for breaking them; and the penance for breaking
the rules prescribed for a Snâtaka is fasting. This is (the object of
the insertion of the word sa, "such (a man)." But, if a Vai*s*ya follows
them, (his reward will be) prosperity; if he breaks them, he need not
perform a penance. With respect to this matter another Sm*ri*ti says:
"The penance which is prescribed for a breach of the Snâtaka laws, must
be performed by a Kshatriya and a Brâhma*n*a alone, never by (men of)
the other (caste)."

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[219:6](sbe0273.htm#fr_1035.md) According to
Haradatta the same rule applies to garlands and shoes.

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[219:7](sbe0273.htm#fr_1036.md) Manu IV, 35. 'The
expression "his beard" includes by implication the nails and the rest. .
. . . As he says "without a sufficient reason," he shall allow his beard
to grow during the pregnancy of his wife and on other occasions. With
respect to this matter they quote the following verse: "In the sixth
year and in the sixteenth year, likewise in the year of his marriage and
during the pregnancy <span id="page_220">p. 220</span> of his wife, he
shall avoid the use of a razor."--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1042"></span>[219:14](sbe0273.htm#fr_1043.md) Âpastamba I, 11,
30, 21. Haradatta remarks that some explain losh*th*a, 'a clod of
earth,' by kapâla, 'a pot-sherd.'

<span id="fn_1043"></span>[219:15](sbe0273.htm#fr_1044.md) Âpastamba II, 8,
20, 11-12. Kapâla, 'pot-sherds,' may also mean 'skull-bones.'

<span id="fn_1044"></span>[219:16](sbe0273.htm#fr_1045.md) Manu IV, 57.
Haradatta says that only a conversation, <span id="page_221">p.
221</span> properly so called, is forbidden, not to ask barbarians &c.
about the road and similar matters.

<span id="fn_1045"></span>[221:18](sbe0273.htm#fr_1046.md) Compare the
analogous case, mentioned Âpastamba I, 3, 9, 13.

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[221:23](sbe0273.htm#fr_1049.md) Âpastamba I, 11,
31, 10. Haradatta remarks that the prohibition does not extend to those
cases where the Vedic ritual requires the fact to be pointed out. 'He
is, of course, right in making this statement, as an express injunction
of the *S*ruti always overrides the rules of the Sm*ri*ti.

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[221:24](sbe0273.htm#fr_1050.md) Haradatta adds
that this and the preceding Sûtras include by implication the cases
where a cow does damage in a field; see Âpastamba I, 11, 31, 9.

ability, for acts tending to the acquisition of spiritual merit, such as
reciting the Vedas; the middle part of the day for the acquisition of

18, 1; II, 8, 20, 10. Haradatta adds that this rule has been inserted
here instead of in the chapter on forbidden food in order to indicate
that its breach must be expiated by the penance prescribed for a breach
of the Snâtaka's vow, not by that prescribed for eating forbidden food.

32, 29; I, 7, 20, 8. Haradatta adds that the plural is used in the above
Sûtra in order to indicate that many Brâhma*n*as must be unanimous
regarding the practices to be followed.

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[225:63](sbe0273.htm#fr_1078.md) Manu IV, 33; X,
113. 'For the sake of these objects he may go to a ruler, i.e. a king
without cringing, because the preposition adhi is used (in the text,
and) adhi denotes mastership' (Pâ*n*ini I, 4, 97). The meaning that he
shall go (as becomes) an independent man.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1078"></span>[225:65](sbe0273.htm#fr_1079.md) Âpastamba I, 5,

Vai*s*yas:

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[225:66](sbe0273.htm#fr_1080.md) Manu IV, 39. 'A
cow, a Brâhma*n*a, a well-known tree, <span id="page_226">p. 226</span>
and the like are called excellent (beings or things). An auspicious
(object), i.e. a filled jar and the like.'--Haradatta.
