### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 2, KHA*ND*A 5.

1\. The word 'austerity' (must be understood to apply) to (the
observance of) the rules (of studentship). <span
id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_185)

2\. If they are transgressed, study drives out the knowledge of the Veda
acquired already, from the (offender) and from his children. <span
id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_186)

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

3\. Besides he will go to hell, and his life will be shortened.

4\. On account of that (transgression of the rules of studentship) no
*Ri*shis are born amongst the men of later ages. <span
id="fr_188"></span>[4](#fn_187)

5\. But some in their new birth, on account of a residue of the merit
acquired by their actions (in former lives), become (similar to)
*Ri*shis by their knowledge (of the Veda), <span
id="fr_189"></span>[5](#fn_188)

6\. Like *S*vetaketu. <span id="fr_190"></span>[6](#fn_189)

7\. And whatever else besides the Veda, (a student) who obeys the rules
learns from his teacher, that brings the same reward as the Veda. <span
id="fr_191"></span>[7](#fn_190)

8\. Also, if desirous to accomplish something (be

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

it good or evil), he thinks it in his mind, or pronounces it in words,
or looks upon it with his eye, even so it will be; thus teach (those who
know the law).

9\. (The duties of a student consist in) acts to please the spiritual
teacher, the observance (of rules) conducive to his own welfare, and
industry in studying. <span id="fr_192"></span>[9](#fn_191)

10\. Acts other than these need not be performed by a student. <span
id="fr_193"></span>[10](#fn_192)

11\. A religious student who retains what he has learned, who finds
pleasure in the fulfilment of the law, who keeps the rules of
studentship, who is upright and forgiving, attains perfection. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[11](#fn_193)

12\. Every day he shall rise in the last watch of the night, and
standing near his teacher, salute him with (this) salutation: I, N. N.,
ho! (salute thee.) <span id="fr_195"></span>[12](#fn_194)

13\. And (he shall salute) before the morning meal also other very aged
(learned Brâhma*n*as) who may live in the same village.

14\. If he has been on a journey, (he shall salute <span
id="fr_196"></span>[14](#fn_195)

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

the persons mentioned) when he meets them on his, return.

15\. (He may also salute the persons mentioned at other times), if he is
desirous of heaven and long life.

16\. A Brâhma*n*a. shall salute stretching forward his right arm on a
level with his ear, a Kshatriya holding it on a level with the breast, a
Vai*s*ya holding it on a level with the waist, a *S*ûdra holding it low,
(and) stretching forward the joined hands. <span
id="fr_197"></span>[16](#fn_196)

17\. And when returning the salute of (a man belonging) to the first
(three) castes, the (last syllable of the) name (of the person
addressed) is produced to the length of three moras. <span
id="fr_198"></span>[17](#fn_197)

18\. But when he meets his teacher after sunrise (coming for his
lesson), he shall embrace (his feet). <span
id="fr_199"></span>[18](#fn_198)

19\. On all other occasions he shall salute (him in the manner described
above).

20\. But some declare that he ought to embrace the (feet of his) teacher
(at every occasion instead of saluting him).

21\. Having stroked the teacher's right foot with his right hand below
and above, he takes hold of it and of the ankle.

22\. Some say, that he must press both feet, each with both hands, and
embrace them. <span id="fr_200"></span>[22](#fn_199)

23\. He shall be very attentive the whole day <span
id="fr_201"></span>[23](#fn_200)

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

long, never allowing his mind to wander from the lesson during the (time
devoted to) studying.

24\. And (at other times he shall be attentive) to the business of his
teacher.

25\. And during the time for rest (he shall give) his mind (to doubtful
passages of the lesson learnt).

26\. And he shall study after having been called by the teacher (and not
request the teacher to begin the lesson). <span
id="fr_202"></span>[26](#fn_201)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_185"></span>[18:1](sbe0208.htm#fr_186) **5**. Manu II, 164.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[18:2](sbe0208.htm#fr_187) The meaning of the
phrase, 'Study drives out the Veda, which has already been learnt from
him who studies transgressing the rules prescribed for the student,' is,
'The Veda recited at the Brahmaya*gñ*a (daily study), and other
religious rites, produces no effect, i.e. gains no merit for the
reciter.' Manu II, 97. Haradatta <span id="page_19">p. 19</span> gives
also the following three explanations of this Sûtra, adopted by other
commentators:--

*a*. If these (rules) are transgressed, he loses his capacity for
learning, because the Brahman forsakes him, &c.

*b*. If these rules are transgressed, the capacity for learning and the
Brahman leave him, &c.

c\. From him who studies whilst transgressing these rules, the Brahman
goes out, &c.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[19:4](sbe0208.htm#fr_188) 'Amongst the avaras
means "amongst the men of modern times, those who live in the Kaliyuga."
No *Ri*shis are born means "there are none who see (receive the
revelation of) Mantras, Vedic texts."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[19:5](sbe0208.htm#fr_189) 'How is it then that
men in our days, though they transgress the rules prescribed for
students, learn the four Vedas with little trouble? (The answer is), By
virtue of a residue of the reward (due) for the proper observance of
those rules (of studentship) in a former Yuga. Therefore Âpastamba says,
Sûtra 6 "But some," &c. New existence means "new birth
(life)."'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[19:6](sbe0208.htm#fr_190) An example of this
(follows, Sûtra 6): 'Like *S*vetaketu. For *S*vetaketu learned the four
Vedas in a short time; as we read in the *Kh*ândogya Upanishad
(Prapâ*th*aka VI, 1).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[19:7](sbe0208.htm#fr_191) 'Whatever else
besides the Veda, such as poison-charms and the like,'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[20:9](sbe0208.htm#fr_192) 'Acts to please the
teacher are--washing his feet and the like; observance (of rules)
conducive to welfare are--obedience to the prohibition to cross a river
swimming, to eat pungent condiments, and obedience to the injunction to
beg.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[20:10](sbe0208.htm#fr_193) 'Acts other than
these, such as pilgrimages and the like.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[20:11](sbe0208.htm#fr_194) 'What this
"perfection" is has been declared in Sûtras 7, 8.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[20:12](sbe0208.htm#fr_195) Manu II, 122 and
124.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[20:14](sbe0208.htm#fr_196) This salutation is
to be performed only when the occasion requires it. The
formerly-mentioned salutation (Sûtras 12, 13) is to be performed daily.
In the next Sûtra follows that by which the fulfilment of a wish may be
obtained.--Haradatta. Manu II, 121; Yâ*gñ*. I, 26.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[21:16](sbe0208.htm#fr_197) 'A Vai*s*ya shall
salute stretching forth his arm on a level with his middle, i.e. the
stomach; others say, on a level with his thigh; the *S*ûdra stretching
it forth low, i.e. on a level with his feet.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[21:17](sbe0208.htm#fr_198) See also Manu II,
225.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[21:18](sbe0208.htm#fr_199) Manu II, 71.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[21:22](sbe0208.htm#fr_200) Manu II, 72

<span id="fn_200"></span>[21:23](sbe0208.htm#fr_201) Manu II, 191.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[22:26](sbe0208.htm#fr_202) Yâ*gñ*. I, 27; Manu
II, 191.
