<span id="fn_731"></span>[155:1](sbe0257.htm#fr_732.md) **22**. Manu VI, 6.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[155:2](sbe0257.htm#fr_733.md) Manu VI, 5, 21;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 46.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[155:4](sbe0257.htm#fr_734.md) 'Then he shall live
on ether, i.e. eat nothing at all.'--Haradatta. Manu VI, 31; Yâ*gñ*.
III, 55.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[156:6](sbe0257.htm#fr_735.md) 'The word atha,
"now," introduces a different opinion. Above, it has been declared that
the life in the woods (may be begun) after the studentship only. But
some teachers enjoin just for that hermit a successive performance of
the acts.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[156:8](sbe0257.htm#fr_736.md) Manu VI, 3 seq.;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 45.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[156:10](sbe0257.htm#fr_737.md) Haradatta thinks
that this rule refers both to the hermit who lives with his family and
to him who lives alone. Others refer it to the latter only.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[156:15](sbe0257.htm#fr_738.md) According to
Haradatta, the word kâ*g*a appears to designate a 'mallet;' in the
passage from the Râmâya*n*a quoted in the Petersburg Dict. the
commentator explains it by pe*t*aka, 'basket.'

<span id="fn_738"></span>[157:17](sbe0257.htm#fr_739.md) Yâ*gñ*. III, 46.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[157:20](sbe0257.htm#fr_740.md) This Sûtra
explains the word upâ*ms*u, 'inaudibly.'

<span id="fn_740"></span>[157:24](sbe0257.htm#fr_741.md) Manu VI, 15;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 47.
