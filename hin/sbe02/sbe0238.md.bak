### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 2, KHA*ND*A 3.

1\. Pure men of the first three castes shall prepare the food (of a
householder which is used) at the Vai*s*vadeva ceremony. <span
id="fr_542"></span>[1](#fn_541.md)

2\. The (cook) shall not speak, nor cough, nor sneeze, while his face is
turned towards the food.

3\. He shall purify himself by touching water if he has touched his
hair, his limbs, or his garment.

4\. Or *S*ûdras may prepare the food, under the superintendence of men
of the first three castes.

5\. For them is prescribed the same rule of sipping water (as for their
masters). <span id="fr_543"></span>[5](#fn_542.md)

6\. Besides, the (*S*ûdra cooks) daily shall cause to be cut the hair of
their heads, their beards, the hair on their bodies, and their nails.

7\. And they shall bathe, keeping their clothes on. <span
id="fr_544"></span>[7](#fn_543.md)

8\. Or they may trim (their hair and nails) on the eighth day (of each
half-month), or on the days of the full and. new moon.

9\. He (the householder himself) shall place on the fire that food which
has been prepared (by *S*ûdras) without supervision, and shall sprinkle
it with water. Such food also they state to be fit for the gods.

10\. When the food is ready, (the cook) shall place

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

himself before his master and announce it to him (saying), 'It is
ready.'

11\. The answer (of the master) shall be, 'That well-prepared food is
the means to obtain splendour; may it never fail!' <span
id="fr_545"></span>[11](#fn_544.md)

12\. The burnt-oblations and Bali-offerings made with the food which the
husband and his wife are to eat, bring (as their reward) prosperity,
(and the enjoyment of) heaven. <span id="fr_546"></span>[12](#fn_545.md)

13\. Whilst learning the sacred formulas (to be recited during the
performance) of those (burnt oblations and Bali-offerings, a
householder) shall sleep on the ground, abstain from connubial
intercourse and from eating pungent condiments and salt, during twelve
days. <span id="fr_547"></span>[13](#fn_546.md)

14\. (When he studies the Mantras) for the last (Bali offered to the
goblins), he shall fast for one (day and) night. <span
id="fr_548"></span>[14](#fn_547.md)

15\. For each Bali-offering the ground must be prepared separately. (The
performer) sweeps (the ground) with his (right) hand, sprinkles it with
water, turning, the palm downwards, throws down (the offering), and
afterwards sprinkles water around it. <span
id="fr_549"></span>[15](#fn_548.md)

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

16\. (At the Vai*s*vadeva sacrifice) he shall offer the oblations with
his hand, (throwing them) into the kitchen-fire or into the sacred
(G*ri*hya)-fire, and reciting (each time one of) the first six Mantras
(prescribed in the Nârâya*n*î Upanishad). <span
id="fr_550"></span>[16](#fn_549.md)

17\. He shall sprinkle water all around both times (before and after the
oblations), as (has been declared) above. <span

performance of those Bali-offerings that are performed in one
place. <span id="fr_552"></span>[18](#fn_551.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_541"></span>[104:1](sbe0238.htm#fr_542.md) **3**. 'The food
which is used at the Vai*s*vadeva, i. e. the food prepared for the meals
of the householder and of his wife.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[104:5](sbe0238.htm#fr_543.md) This Sûtra is a
*Gñ*âpaka, as it indicates that Âpastamba also recognises the different
rules which are usually prescribed in the Sm*ri*tis for Brâhma*n*as,
Kshatriyas, Vai*s*yas, and *S*ûdras. See above, I, 5, 16, 2.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[104:7](sbe0238.htm#fr_544.md) Usually in bathing
both Âryas and *S*ûdras wear no dress except the lango*t*î.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[105:11](sbe0238.htm#fr_545.md) Manu II, 54.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[105:12](sbe0238.htm#fr_546.md) Balis are portions
of food which are thrown before the door, or on the floor of the house.
See below, Sûtra 16 seq.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[105:13](sbe0238.htm#fr_547.md) Others explain
this Sûtra thus: 'After having used for the first time these sacred
formulas (which are to be recited in offering the burnt-oblation and the
Balis, the householder and his wife) shall sleep,' &c.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[105:14](sbe0238.htm#fr_548.md) Regarding the use
of ekarâtra in the sense of 'a (day and a) night,' see above. The 'last'
Bali-offering is that described below, II ,2, 4, 5.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[105:15](sbe0238.htm#fr_549.md) 'They say that the
word "afterwards" is used in order to indicate that perfumes, garlands,
and other (Upa*k*âras) must be, offered between (the last two
acts).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[106:16](sbe0238.htm#fr_550.md) It is a disputed
point with the commentators whether every Brâhma*n*a may offer the
Vai*s*vadeva in the common kitchen-fire, or those persons only who do
not keep a sacred domestic fire. The six Mantras, which are given Taitt.
Âr. X, 67, 1, are: 1. Agnaye svâhâ, 'to Agni svâhâ'; 2. Somâya svâhâ,
'to Soma svâhâ'; 3. Vi*s*vebhyo devebhya*h* svâhâ, 'to all the gods
svâhâ'; 4. Dhruvâya bhûmaya svâhâ, 'to Dhruva Bhûma svâhâ'; 5.
Dhruvakshitaye svâhâ, 'to Dhruvakshiti svâhâ'; 6. A*k*yutakshitaye
svâhâ, 'to A*k*yutakshiti svâhâ.' Haradatta adds that some add a seventh
formula, addressed to Agni svish*t*ak*ri*t, 'to the fire which causes
the proper performance of the sacrifice,' while others leave out the
second Mantra and give that addressed to Agni svish*t*ak*ri*t the sixth
place. This latter is the order given in the Calcutta edition of the
Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[106:17](sbe0238.htm#fr_551.md) 'Above, i.e.
G*ri*hya-sûtra, I, 2, 3, 8.'--Haradatta. The Mantras recited are: 1. at
the first sprinkling, Adite ’numanyasva, 'Aditi permit'; Anumate
’numanyasva, 'Anumati permit'; Sarasvaty anumanyasva, 'Sarasvatî
permit'; Deva Savita*h* prasuva, 'Divine Savit*ri* permit'; 2. at the
second sprinkling, the same as above, anvama*m*sthâ*h* and prâsâvî*h*,
'thou hast permitted,' being substituted for anumanyasva and prasuva.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[106:18](sbe0238.htm#fr_552.md) This Sûtra is a
restriction of Sûtra 15.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[106:20](sbe0238.htm#fr_553.md) The first six
offerings constitute the Devaya*gñ*a or Vai*s*vadeva, which is offered
in the fire. Now follow the Bali-offerings, which are merely placed on
the ground. 'Behind the fire' means to the east of the fire'; for the
sacrificer must face the east.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[107:21](sbe0238.htm#fr_554.md) The Mantra is,
Adbbya*h* svâhâ, 'to the Waters svâhâ.'

<span id="fn_554"></span>[107:22](sbe0238.htm#fr_555.md) The Mantras are,
Osbadhivanaspatibbya*h* svâhâ, 'to the herbs and trees svâhâ';
Raksbodeva*g*anebhya*h* svâhâ, 'to the Râkshasas and the servants of the
gods svâhâ.'

<span id="fn_555"></span>[107:23](sbe0238.htm#fr_556.md) These four Balis
are sacred to the G*ri*hâs, to the Avasânas, to the Avasânapatis, and to
all creatures.
