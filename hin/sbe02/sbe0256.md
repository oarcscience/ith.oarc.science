### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 9, KHA*ND*A 21.

1\. There are four orders, viz. the order of householders, the order of
students, the order of ascetics, and the order of hermits in the
woods. <span id="fr_722"></span>[1](#fn_721.md)

2\. If he lives in all these four according to the rules (of the law),
without allowing himself to be disturbed (by anything), he will obtain
salvation. <span id="fr_723"></span>[2](#fn_722.md)

3\. The duty to live in the teacher's house after the initiation is
common to all of them. <span id="fr_724"></span>[3](#fn_723.md)

5\. Having learnt the rites (that are to be performed in each order), he
may perform what he wishes.

6\. Worshipping until death (and living) according to the rule of a
(temporary) student, a (professed) student may leave his body in the
house of his teacher.

7\. Now (follow the rules) regarding the ascetic (Sa*m*nyâsin).

8\. Only after (having fulfilled) the duties of that (order of students)

9\. For him (the Sa*m*nyâsin) they prescribe the following rules).

10\. He shall live without a fire, without a house, Without pleasures,
without protection. Remaining silent and uttering speech only on the
occasion of the daily recitation of the Veda, begging so much food only

id="fr_726"></span>[10](#fn_725.md)

world and the next, he shall seek the Âtman. <span
id="fr_728"></span>[13](#fn_727.md)

15\. (But) that (opinion) is opposed to the *S*âstras. <span
id="fr_729"></span>[15](#fn_728.md)

16\. (For) if salvation were obtained by the knowledge of the Âtman
alone, then he ought not to feel any pain even in this (world).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_721"></span>[153:1](sbe0256.htm#fr_722.md) **21**. 'Though
four (orders) are enumerated, he uses the word "four," lest, in the
absence of a distinct rule of the venerable teacher, one order only,
that of the householder, should be allowed, as has been taught in other
Sm*ri*tis.'--Haradatta. Manu VI, 87.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[153:2](sbe0256.htm#fr_723.md) Manu VI, 88.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[153:3](sbe0256.htm#fr_724.md) Manu II, 247-249,
and above.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[153:8](sbe0256.htm#fr_725.md) The meaning of the
Sûtra is, that the studentship is a necessary preliminary for the
Sa*m*nyâsin. If a man considers sufficiently purified by his life in
that order, he may become a Sa*m*nyâsin immediately after its
completion. Otherwise he may first become a householder, or a hermit,
and enter the last <span id="page_154">p. 154</span> order, when his
passions are entirely extinct. See also Manu VI, 36; Yâ*gñ*. III, 56-57.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[154:10](sbe0256.htm#fr_726.md) Manu VI, 33,
42-45; Yâ*gñ*. III, 58 seq.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[154:12](sbe0256.htm#fr_727.md) 'Another
(commentator) says, "Some declare that he is free from all injunctions
and prohibitions, i.e. he need neither perform nor avoid any (particular
actions),"'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[154:13](sbe0256.htm#fr_728.md) 'He shall seek,
i.e. worship, the Âtman or Self, which has been described in the section
on transcendental knowledge (I, 8).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[154:15](sbe0256.htm#fr_729.md) Haradatta
apparently takes the word *S*âstras to mean 'Dharma*s*âstras.'

<span id="fn_729"></span>[154:17](sbe0256.htm#fr_730.md) 'That which
follows' are the Yogas, which must be employed in order to cause the
annihilation of pain, after the knowledge of the Âtman or Self has been
obtained.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[155:21](sbe0256.htm#fr_731.md) 'But which is that
one fire? Certainly not the G*ri*hya-fire, because he must remain
chaste. Therefore the meaning intended is, "He shall offer a Samidh morn
and evening in the common fire, just as formerly, (during his
studentship)." Another commentator says, "Gautama declares that he shall
kindle a fire according to the rule of the *S*râmanaka Sûtra. The
*S*râmanaka Sûtra is the Vaikhânasa Sûtra. Having kindled a fire in the
manner prescribed there, he shall sacrifice in it every morning and
every evening."'--Haradatta. See also Manu VI, 4; Yâ*gñ*. III, 45.
