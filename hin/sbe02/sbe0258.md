### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 9, KHA*ND*A 23.

1\. If he desires (to perform) very great austerities, he (shall not
make a hoard of grain, but) collect food every day only, morning and
evening, in his vessel. <span id="fr_742"></span>[1](#fn_741)

2\. Afterwards he shall wander about, sustaining his life with roots,
fruits, leaves, and grass (which he <span

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

collects). Finally (he shall content himself with) what has become
detached spontaneously. Then he shall live on water, then on air, (and
finally) upon ether. Each succeeding mode of subsistence procures
greater rewards.

3\. Now they quote (the following) two verses from a Purâ*n*a: <span
id="fr_744"></span>[3](#fn_743)

4\. Those eighty thousand sages who desired offspring passed to the
south by Aryaman's road and obtained burial-grounds. <span
id="fr_745"></span>[4](#fn_744)

5\. Those eighty thousand sages who desired no offspring passed by
Aryaman's road to the north and obtained immortality.

6\. Thus are praised those who keep the vow of chastity.

7\. Now they accomplish also their wishes merely by conceiving them,

8\. For instance, (the desire to procure) rain, to bestow children,
second-sight, to move quick as thought, and other (desires) of this
description.

9\. Therefore on account of (passages) of the revealed texts, and on
account of the visible results, some declare these orders (of men
keeping the vow of chastity to be) the most excellent.

10\. But (to this we answer): It is the firm opinion of those who are
well versed in the threefold sacred learning, that the Vedas are the
highest authority.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

\[paragraph continues\] They consider that the (rites) which are ordered
there to be performed with rice, yava, animals, clarified butter, milk,
potsherds, (in conjunction) with a wife, (and accompanied) by loud or
muttered (Mantras), must be performed, and that (hence) a rule of
conduct which is opposed to these (rites) is of no authority.

11\. But by the term burial-ground (in the text above given) it is
intended to ordain the last rites for those who have performed many
sacrifices, (and not to mean that dead householders become demons and
haunt burial-grounds.) <span id="fr_746"></span>[11](#fn_745)

12\. The revealed texts declare that after (the burial follows) a reward
without end, which is designated by the term 'heavenly bliss.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_741"></span>[157:1](sbe0258.htm#fr_742) **23**. The
following rules apply to a solitary hermit.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[157:2](sbe0258.htm#fr_743) These Sûtras are
repeated in order to show that, according to, the opinion of those who
allow hermits to live with their families, the end should be the same.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[158:3](sbe0258.htm#fr_744) 'The "orders" have
been described. Now, giving conflicting opinions, he discusses which of
them is the most important.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[158:4](sbe0258.htm#fr_745) This verse and the
next are intended to disparage the order of householders. Haradatta
explains 'burial-grounds' by 'new births which lead to new deaths;' but
see below, Sûtra 10. See also Yâ*gñ*. III, 186-187.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[159:11](sbe0258.htm#fr_746) The Sûtra is
intended to remove the blame thrown on the order of householders by the
verse quoted. Haradatta seems to have forgotten his former explanation
of *S*ma*s*ânâni.
