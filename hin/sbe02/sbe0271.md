*S*ûdra. <span id="fr_1011"></span>[22](#fn_1010.md)

23\. Some (permit) even this in case his life is in danger.

<span id="fn_996"></span>[211:1](sbe0271.htm#fr_997.md) **VII**. Âpastamba

27.

<span id="fn_999"></span>[211:4](sbe0271.htm#fr_1000.md) Haradatta quotes
Manu X, 103 in support of the above explanation, and adds that another
commentator interprets the <span id="page_212">p. 212</span> Sûtra to
mean, that in times of distress men of all castes may support themselves
by sacrificing for others, teaching, and the acceptance of gifts, though
in ordinary times these modes of living are reserved for Brâhma*n*as.

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[212:5](sbe0271.htm#fr_1001.md) The use of the
masculine in the text, 'pûrva*h* pûrvo guru*h*,' may, I think, be
explained by the fact that the compound in the preceding Sûtra ends with
a noun of the masculine gender.

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[212:6](sbe0271.htm#fr_1002.md) Manu X, 81;
Yâ*gñ*. III, 35.

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[212:7](sbe0271.htm#fr_1003.md) Âpastamba I, 7,
20, 11.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[212:9](sbe0271.htm#fr_1004.md) Âpastamba I, 7,
20, 12-13. 'Substances used for flavouring (rasa), i.e. oil, sugar,
clarified butter, salt, and the like.'--Haradatta. From Sûtra 19 it is
clear that 'rasa' does not simply mean 'liquids.'

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[212:10](sbe0271.htm#fr_1005.md) My MSS. read
nir*n*ikte for nikte, and nir*n*iktam is explained by 'washed by a
washerman or the like person.' It is possible to translate Professor
Stenzler's reading in accordance with Manu X, 87, 'pairs of (i.e. upper
and lower) garments dyed red.'

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[212:11](sbe0271.htm#fr_1006.md) 'Preparations
from it, i.e. sour milk and the like.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1006"></span>[213:14](sbe0271.htm#fr_1007.md) Under any
circumstances (nityam, literally "always") means even when they are not
sold for slaughter. Another (commentator) says, that, as the expression
"under any circumstances" is used here, the prohibition regarding the
above-mentioned things, i.e. sesamum and the like, does not hold good
under all circumstances, and that hence self-grown sesamum and other
grain may be sold, see Manu X, 90.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[213:15](sbe0271.htm#fr_1008.md) Manu X, 88.
Haradatta explains 'land' by 'houses.'

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[213:16](sbe0271.htm#fr_1009.md)-21. Âpastamba I,
7, 20, 14-15.

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[213:19](sbe0271.htm#fr_1010.md) 'The sale of
salt and prepared food has been forbidden by Sûtra 9, but their barter
has been permitted (by Sûtra 17).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[213:22](sbe0271.htm#fr_1011.md) Regarding the
*S*ûdra's occupations, see below, X 57-60.

<span id="fn_1011"></span>[213:24](sbe0271.htm#fr_1012.md) 'Restriction
(niyama), i.e. avoiding. That Brâhma*n*a <span id="page_214">p.
214</span> even who lives the life of a *S*ûdra must not mix with that
*S*ûdra caste, i.e. he must not sit among *S*ûdras and so
forth.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1012"></span>[214:25](sbe0271.htm#fr_1013.md) Âpastamba I, 10,
29, 7; Manu VIII, 348.

<span id="fn_1013"></span>[214:26](sbe0271.htm#fr_1014.md) Haradatta adds,
that in accordance with the principle exemplified by the rule of this
Sûtra a Vai*s*ya may follow in times of distress the occupations of a
*S*ûdra.
