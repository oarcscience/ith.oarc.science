<span id="fn_523"></span>[98:24](sbe0235.htm#fr_524.md) Haradatta tells the
story to which the second half of the verse alludes, in the following
manner: 'A certain *Ri*shi had two pupils, called Dharmaprahrâda and
Kumâlana. Once they brought from the forest two great bundles of
firewood and threw them negligently into their teacher's house, without
looking. One of the bundles struck the teacher's little son so that he
died. Then the teacher asked his two pupils, "Which of you two has
killed him?" Both answered, "Not I, not I." Hereupon the teacher, being
unable to (come to a decision in order to) send away, the sinner and to
keep the innocent one, called Death, and asked him, "Which of the two
has killed the boy?" Then Death, finding himself involved in a difficult
law-question, began to weep, and <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> giving
his decision, said, "Oh Dharmaprahrâda, not to Kumâlana (the dative has
the sense of the genitive), this sin is none of Kumâlana's!" Instead of
declaring, "Dharmaprahrâda, thou hast done this,' he said, "The other
did not do it." Still from the circumstances of the case it appeared
that the meaning of the answer was, "The other has done it." "This was
the decision which he gave crying."'--The reading of the text rendered
in the translation is, dharmaprahrâda na kumâlanâya.
