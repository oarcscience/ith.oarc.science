### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. A king and a Brâhma*n*a, deeply versed in the Vedas, these two,
uphold the moral order in the world. <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[1](#fn_1014.md)

2\. On them depends the existence of the fourfold human race, of
internally conscious beings, of those which move on feet and on wings,
and of those which creep, <span id="fr_1016"></span>[2](#fn_1015.md)

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

3\. (As well as) the protection of offspring, the prevention of the
confusion (of the castes and) the sacred law. <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[3](#fn_1016.md)

4\. He is (called) deeply versed in the Vedas, <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[4](#fn_1017.md)

5\. Who is acquainted with the (ways of the) world, the Vedas (and
their) Aṅgas (auxiliary sciences),

6\. Who is skilled in disputations (and), in (reciting) legends and the
Purâ*n*a,

8\. Who has been sanctified by the forty sacraments (sa*m*skâra), <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[8](#fn_1018.md)

9\. Who is constantly engaged in the three occupations (prescribed for
all twice-born men), <span id="fr_1020"></span>[9](#fn_1019.md)

10\. Or in the six (occupations prescribed specially for a
Brâhma*n*a), <span id="fr_1021"></span>[10](#fn_1020.md)

11\. (And) who is well versed in the duties of <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[11](#fn_1021.md)

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

daily life settled by the agreement (of those who know the law).

12\. (Such a Brâhma*n*a) must be allowed by the king immunity from (the
following) six (kinds of opprobrious treatment): <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[12](#fn_1022.md)

13\. (I.e.) he must not be subjected to corporal punishment, he must not
be imprisoned, he must not be fined, he must not be exiled, he must not
be reviled, nor be excluded.

14\. The Garbhâdhâna (or ceremony to cause conception), the Pu*m*savana
(or ceremony to cause the birth of a male child), the Sîmantonnayana (or
arranging the parting of the pregnant wife's hair), the *G*âtakarman (or
ceremony on the birth of the child), the ceremony of naming the child,
the first feeding, the *K*aula (or tonsure of the head of the child),
the initiation, <span id="fr_1024"></span>[14](#fn_1023.md)

15\. The four vows (undertaken) for the study of the Veda, <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[15](#fn_1024.md)

16\. The bath (on completion of the studentship), <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[16](#fn_1025.md)

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

the taking of a help-mate for the fulfilment of the religious duties,
the performance of the five sacrifices to gods, manes, men, goblins, and
Brahman,

17\. And (the performance) of the following (sacrifices):

18\. The seven kinds of Pâkaya*gñ*as (or small sacrifices),viz. the
Ash*t*akâ, the Pârva*n*a Sthâlîpâka, offered on the new and full moon
days), the funeral oblations, the Srâva*n*î, the Âgrahâya*n*î, the
*K*aitrî, and the Âsvayu*g*î; <span id="fr_1027"></span>[18](#fn_1026.md)

19\. The seven kinds of Havirya*gñ*as, viz. the Agnyâdheya, the
Agnihotra, the Dar*s*apaur*n*amâsas, the Âgraya*n*a, the *K*âturmâsyas,

Atyagnish*t*oma, the Ukthya, the Sho*d*a*s*in, the Atirâtra, and the
Aptoryâma;

21\. These are the forty sacraments.

22\. Now (follow) the eight good qualities of the soul, <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[22](#fn_1028.md)

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

23\. (Viz.) compassion on all creatures, forbearance, freedom from
anger, purity, quietism, auspiciousness, freedom from avarice, and
freedom from covetousness. <span id="fr_1030"></span>[23](#fn_1029.md)

24\. He who is sanctified by these forty sacraments, but whose soul is
destitute of the eight good qualities, will not be united with Brahman,
nor does he reach his heaven.

25\. But he, forsooth, who is sanctified by a few only of these forty
sacraments, and whose soul is endowed with the eight excellent
qualities, will be united with Brahman, and will dwell in his heaven.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1014"></span>[214:1](sbe0272.htm#fr_1015.md) **VIII**.
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a V, 4, 4, 5; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 29. Haradatta
explains vrata, ' moral order,' by karmâ*n*i, 'the rites and
occupations,' and loka, 'world,' by râsh*t*ra, 'kingdom.' Ultimately my
translation and his explanation come to the same thing. He adds that the
king upholds order by punishing, and a learned Brâhma*n*a by teaching.
Regarding the excellence of these two, see also Manu IV, 135.

<span id="fn_1015"></span>[214:2](sbe0272.htm#fr_1016.md) 'Internally
conscious beings, i.e. trees and the like, which are immovable, but grow
and decay. For such possess internal consciousness only, no
corresponding external faculty of acting. . . . The existence of these,
i.e. of men and the rest, depends upon, i.e. is subordinate to the king
and to a Brâhma*n*a deeply versed in the Vedas. How is that? As regards
the Brâhma*n*a, an offering which has been properly thrown into the fire
reaches the sun; from the sun comes rain; from rain food is produced and
thereon live the creatures. By this reasoning he is shown to <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> be the cause of their existence. But the
king is (also) the cause of their existence; for he punishes robbers and
the like.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1016"></span>[215:3](sbe0272.htm#fr_1017.md) Haradatta takes
prasûtiraksha*n*am, 'the protection of their offspring,' as a copulative
compound, and explains it by their prosperity (abhiv*ri*ddhi) and their
protection.' But a samâhâradvandva is here out of place.

<span id="fn_1017"></span>[215:4](sbe0272.htm#fr_1018.md) Macnaghten,
Mitâksharâ I, 2, 27. 'By the word loka, "the world," are intended the
laws of countries and the like, which may be learnt from the practice of
the world.'--Haradatta. Regarding the Aṅgas, see Âpastamba II, 4, 8, 10.

<span id="fn_1018"></span>[215:8](sbe0272.htm#fr_1019.md) Regarding the
forty sacraments, see below, Sûtras 14-20.

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[215:9](sbe0272.htm#fr_1020.md) Regarding the
three occupations, common to all twice-born men, see below, X, 1.

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[215:10](sbe0272.htm#fr_1021.md) See below, X, 2.

<span id="fn_1021"></span>[215:11](sbe0272.htm#fr_1022.md) The
Sâmayâ*k*ârika or Smârta duties are those taught in the Dharma-sûtras
and Sm*ri*tis, see Âpastamba I, 1, 1, 1, and Max 'Müller's History of
Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 101.

<span id="fn_1022"></span>[216:12](sbe0272.htm#fr_1023.md) See Weber, Ind.
Stud. X, V, 60, 66; Macnaghten, Mitâksharâ I, 2, 27.

<span id="fn_1023"></span>[216:14](sbe0272.htm#fr_1024.md) Regarding the
Sa*m*skâras mentioned in this Sûtra, see Â*s*valâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra I,
13-23; *S*âṅkhâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 19-II, 5; Pâraskara G*ri*hya-sûtra
I, 13-11, 2.

<span id="fn_1024"></span>[216:15](sbe0272.htm#fr_1025.md) The four vows,
as Haradatta states, are, according to Â*s*valâyana, the Mahânâmnîvrata,
the Mahâvrata, the Upanishad-vrata, and the Godâna; see Â*s*valâyana
*S*rauta-sûtra VIII, 14, where the first three are described in detail,
and G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 22, 3, with the commentary thereon. Other
G*ri*hya-sûtras give more and different names, see H. Oldenberg,
*S*âṅkhâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra II, 11-12 (S. B. E., vol. xxix), and Gobhila
G*ri*hya-sûtra III, 1, 28-III, 2, 62.

<span id="fn_1025"></span>[216:16](sbe0272.htm#fr_1026.md) Haradatta
explains snâna, 'the bath,' by samâvartana, 'the ceremony on completion
of the studentship.' Regarding the five sacrifices, usually called the
great sacrifices, see above, VII, 9 seq.

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[217:18](sbe0272.htm#fr_1027.md) The various
Pâkaya*gñ*as, named here, are fully described by Â*s*valâyana
G*ri*hya-sûtra II, 1, 1-11, 10, 8; Gobhila III, 10 seq.; Pâraskara III,
3 seq. See also Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p.
203. The Ash*t*akas are sacrifices offered on the eighth day of the dark
halves of the winter months, and of those of the dewy season, i.e.
Kârttika, Mârga*s*iras, Pausha, and Mâgha. The Srâva*n*î is offered on
the full moon day of the month of Srâva*n*a, the Âgrahâya*n*î on the
fourteenth, or on the full moon day of Mârga*s*iras, the *K*aitrî on the
full moon day of the *K*aitra, and the Âsvayu*g*î on the full moon day
of the month Â*s*vayu*g*a or Â*s*vina.

<span id="fn_1027"></span>[217:19](sbe0272.htm#fr_1028.md)-20. The
Havirya*gñ*as and Soma-sacrifices are described in the Brâhma*n*as and
*S*rauta-sûtras. Havis denotes any kind of food used for oblations, such
as clarified butter, milk, rice meat, &c.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[217:22](sbe0272.htm#fr_1029.md) Âpastamba I, 8,
23, 6.

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[218:23](sbe0272.htm#fr_1030.md) Haradatta
explains maṅgalya, 'auspiciousness,' to mean always doing what is
praised (by good men) and avoiding what is blamed by them.' Anâyâsa,
'quietism,' means, according to him, avoiding to undertake that which
causes pain to oneself, even though it be a duty.'
