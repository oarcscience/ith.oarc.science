### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 10, KHA*ND*A 28.

1\. He who, under any conditions whatsoever, covets (and takes) another
man's possessions is a thief; thus (teach) Kautsa and Hârita as well as
Ka*n*va and Pushkarasâdi.

2\. Vârshyâya*n*i declares, that there are exceptions to this law, in
regard to some possessions.

3\. (E.g.) seeds ripening in the pod, food for a draught-ox; (if these
are taken), the owners (ought) not (to) forbid it. <span

4\. To take even these things in too great a quantity is sinful.

5\. Hârita declares, that in every case the permission (of the owner
must be obtained) first.

6\. He shall not go to visit a fallen teacher or blood relation.

7\. Nor shall he accept the (means for procuring) enjoyments from such a
person. <span id="fr_492"></span>[7](#fn_491.md)

8\. If he meets them accidentally he shall silently embrace (their feet)
and pass on.

9\. A mother does very many acts for her son, therefore he must
constantly serve her, though she be fallen.

10\. But (there shall be) no communion (with a fallen mother) in acts
performed for the acquisition of spiritual merit.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

11\. Enjoyments taken unrighteously he shall give up; he shall say, 'I
and sin (do not dwell together).' Clothing himself with a garment
reaching from the navel down to the knee, bathing daily, morn, noon, and
evening, eating food which contains neither milk nor pungent condiments,
nor salt, he shall not enter a house for twelve years. <span
id="fr_493"></span>[11](#fn_492.md)

12\. After that he (may be) purified.

13\. Then he may have intercourse with Aryans.

14\. This penance may also be employed in the case of the other crimes
which cause loss of caste (for which no penance has been ordained
above).

15\. But the violator of a Guru's bed shall enter a hollow iron image
and, having caused a fire to be lit on both sides, he shall burn
himself. <span id="fr_494"></span>[15](#fn_493.md)

16\. According to Hârita, this (last-mentioned penance must) not (be
performed).

17\. For he who takes his own or another's life becomes an Abhi*s*asta.

18\. He (the violator of a Guru's bed) shall perform to his last breath
(the penance) prescribed by that rule (Sûtra 11). He cannot be purified
in this world. But (after death) his sin is taken away.

19\. He who has unjustly forsaken his wife shall put on an ass's skin,
with the hair turned outside, and beg in seven houses, saying, 'Give
alms to him who forsook his wife.' That shall be his livelihood for six
months.

20\. But if a wife forsakes her husband, she shall

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

perform the twelve-night K*rikkh*ra penance for as long a time.

21\. He who has killed a Bhrû*n*a (a man learned in the Vedas and
Vedâṅgas and skilled in the performance of the rites) shall put on the
skin of a dog or of an ass, with the hair turned outside, and take a
human skull for his drinking-vessel,

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_490"></span>[88:3](sbe0231.htm#fr_491.md) **28**. The same
rule Manu emphatically ascribes to himself, Manu VIII, 339, But see also
VIII, 331.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[88:7](sbe0231.htm#fr_492.md) Haradatta remarks,
that this Sûtra implicitly forbids to accept the heritage of an outcast.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[89:11](sbe0231.htm#fr_493.md) A similar but
easier penance is prescribed, Manu XI, 19 4.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[89:15](sbe0231.htm#fr_494.md) '(This penance,
which had been prescribed above, I, 9, 25, 1), is enjoined (once more),
in order to show that it is not optional (as might be expected according
to Sûtra 14).'--Haradatta.
