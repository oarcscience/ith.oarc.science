### CHAPTER XI.

1\. The king is master of all, with the exception of Brâhma*n*as. <span

2\. (He shall be) holy in acts and speech, <span

3\. Fully instructed in the threefold (sacred science) and in
logic, <span id="fr_1131"></span>[3](#fn_1130)

4\. Pure, of subdued senses, surrounded by companions <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[4](#fn_1131)

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

possessing excellent qualities and by the means (for upholding his
rule).

5\. He shall be impartial towards his subjects; <span
id="fr_1133"></span>[5](#fn_1132)

6\. And he shall do (what is) good for them. <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[6](#fn_1133)

7\. All, excepting Brâhma*n*as, shall worship him who is seated on a
higher seat, (while they them-selves sit on a) lower (one). <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[7](#fn_1134)

8\. The (Brâhma*n*as), also, shall honour him. <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[8](#fn_1135)

9\. He shall protect the castes and orders in accordance with
justice; <span id="fr_1137"></span>[9](#fn_1136)

10\. And those who leave (the path of) duty, he shall lead back (to
it). <span id="fr_1138"></span>[10](#fn_1137)

11\. For it is declared (in the Veda) that he obtains a share of the
spiritual merit (gained by his subjects). <span
id="fr_1139"></span>[11](#fn_1138)

12\. And he shall select as his domestic priest (purohita) a Brâhma*n*a
who is learned (in the Vedas), of noble family, eloquent, handsome, of
(a suitable) age, and of a virtuous disposition, who lives righteously
and who is austere. <span id="fr_1140"></span>[12](#fn_1139)

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

13\. With his assistance he shall fulfil his religious duties. <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[13](#fn_1140)

14\. For it is declared (in the Veda): 'Kshatriyas, who are assisted by
Brâhma*n*as, prosper and do not fall into distress.' <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[14](#fn_1141)

15\. He shall, also, take heed of that which astrologers and
interpreters of omens tell (him).

16\. For some (declare), that the acquisition of wealth and security
depend also upon that.

17\. He shall perform in the fire of the hall the rites ensuring
prosperity which are connected with expiations (*s*ânti), festivals, a
prosperous march, long life, and auspiciousness; as well as those that
are intended to cause enmity, to subdue (enemies), to destroy (them) by
incantations, and to cause their misfortune. <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[17](#fn_1142)

18\. Officiating priests (shall perform) the other (sacrifices)
according to the precepts (of the Veda). <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[18](#fn_1143)

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

19\. His administration of justice (shall be regulated by) the Veda, the
Institutes of the Sacred Law, the Aṅgas, and the Purâ*n*a. <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[19](#fn_1144)

20\. The laws of countries, castes, and families, which are not opposed
to the (sacred) records, (have) also authority. <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[20](#fn_1145)

21\. Cultivators, traders, herdsmen, money-lenders, and artisans (have
authority to lay down rules) for their respective classes.

22\. Having learned the (state of) affairs from those who (in each
class) have authority (to speak he shall give) the legal decision. <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[22](#fn_1146)

23\. Reasoning is a means for arriving at the truth. <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[23](#fn_1147)

24\. Coming to a conclusion through that, he shall decide properly.

25\. If (the evidence) is conflicting, he shall learn (the truth) from
(Brâhma*n*as) who are well versed in <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[25](#fn_1148)

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

the threefold sacred lore, and give his decision (accordingly).

26\. For, (if he acts) thus, blessings will attend him (in this world
and the next). <span id="fr_1150"></span>[26](#fn_1149)

27\. It has been declared in the Veda: 'Brâhma*n*as, united with
Kshatriyas, uphold gods, manes, and men.

28\. They declare, that (the word) da*nd*a (rule or punishment) is
derived from (the verb) damayati (he restrains); therefore he shall
restrain those who do not restrain themselves.

29\. (Men of) the (several) castes and orders who always live according
to their duty enjoy after death the rewards of their works, and by
virtue of a remnant of their (merit) they are born again in excellent
countries, castes, and families, (endowed) with beauty, long life,
learning in the Vedas, (virtuous) conduct, wealth, happiness, and
wisdom. <span id="fr_1151"></span>[29](#fn_1150)

30\. Those who act in a contrary manner perish, being born again in
various (evil conditions). <span id="fr_1152"></span>[30](#fn_1151)

31\. The advice of the spiritual teacher and the punishment (inflicted
by the king) guard them. <span id="fr_1153"></span>[31](#fn_1152)

32\. Therefore a king and a spiritual teacher must not be reviled. <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[32](#fn_1153)

Macnaghten, Mitâksharâ I, 1, 27; Manu IX, 313-322; Weber, Ind. Stud. X,
29, 60.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[234:2](sbe0275.htm#fr_1130) Manu VII, 26.
'Holy in acts,' i.e. constantly acting in conformity with the *S*âstras;
'holy in speech,' i.e. when administering justice he shall not speak
partially.

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[234:3](sbe0275.htm#fr_1131) Manu VII, 43;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 310. Haradatta thinks that the term 'the threefold
sacred science includes the fourth Veda also, because it consists
chiefly of *Rik*as and Ya*g*us formulas.'

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[234:4](sbe0275.htm#fr_1132) Manu VII, 30-31;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 354; Âpastamba III, 11, 27, 18. 'Of subdued senses,
i.e. free from the (seven) vices <span id="page_235">p. 235</span>
(common among kings), i.e. sensuality, gambling, hunting, drinking,
&c.'--Haradatta. The means (upâya) are those mentioned by Yâ*gñ*avalkya
I, 345-346.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[235:5](sbe0275.htm#fr_1133) Manu VII, 80;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 333.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[235:6](sbe0275.htm#fr_1134) 'And he shall do
what is good, i.e. dig tanks, build embankments and bridges &c. for
them, i.e. his subjects.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[235:7](sbe0275.htm#fr_1135) '(On a) lower
(one), i.e. on the ground only.'--Haradatta. This is still the custom in
native courts, where, however, Brâhma*n*as, as a rule, must also sit on
the floor.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[235:8](sbe0275.htm#fr_1136) 'Honour him,'
i.e. worship him by invoking blessings on him and the like.

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[235:9](sbe0275.htm#fr_1137) Manu VII, 35.

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[235:10](sbe0275.htm#fr_1138) Yâ*gñ*avalkya I,
360.

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[235:11](sbe0275.htm#fr_1139) Manu VIII, 304;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 334.

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[235:12](sbe0275.htm#fr_1140) Manu VII, 78;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 312. Haradatta explains vâksampanna, 'eloquent,' by
'one who knows Sanskrit.' According to the same, 'the (suitable) age' is
the prime of life, when men are neither too young nor too old. 'Austere'
is interpreted to mean 'not given to sensual enjoyments.'

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[236:13](sbe0275.htm#fr_1141) Manu VII, 78.

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[236:14](sbe0275.htm#fr_1142)
*S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a IV, I, 4, 4-6.

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[236:17](sbe0275.htm#fr_1143) Âpastamba II,
10, 25, 4, 7. Sântis, 'expiations,' are rites intended to avert an
impending misfortune which is announced by an evil omen. 'Festivals'
are, according to Haradatta, wedding-days and the like; 'rites connected
with auspiciousness' are, according to the same, rites on entering a new
dwelling and the like. Haradatta further remarks that, though, according
to the text, the king must perform these rites, he is, in reality, only
to give the necessary orders, and to furnish the means for their
performance, while the Purohita is to officiate as priest. He adds, that
another commentator asserts that 'the Purohita,' not 'the king,' must be
taken as the subject of the sentence.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[236:18](sbe0275.htm#fr_1144) Manu VII, 78-79;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 313. Haradatta says that by the 'other' sacrifices,
both G*ri*hya and *S*rauta rites are meant. I think that the latter are
chiefly intended, as the Sa*m*skâras are included under the rites of
festive days, mentioned in the preceding Sûtra.

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[237:19](sbe0275.htm#fr_1145) The Aṅgas, i.e.
the six auxiliary branches of learning mentioned above, VIII, 5. My best
copy inserts 'the Upavedas' after the Aṅgas. But the words upavedâ*h*
and dharmasâstrâ*n*i, 'the institutes of law,' are probably
interpolations. For the latter are already included by the term Aṅga, as
part of the Kalpa.

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[237:20](sbe0275.htm#fr_1146) Âpastamba II, 6,
15, 1; Manu VII, 203; V111, 47, 46; Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 342. 'The (sacred)
records, i.e. the Vedas and the rest.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[237:22](sbe0275.htm#fr_1147) 'Having learned,
i.e. having heard and considered, from them, i.e. from men of those
classes, according to their authority, i.e. from those who in each class
are authorised to give decisions, the (state of) affairs, i.e. the
peculiar customs, the legal decision must be given in accordance with
that which they declare to be the rule in their community.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[237:23](sbe0275.htm#fr_1148) Manu VIII, 44;
XII, 105-106; Macnaghten, Mitâksharâ II, 8, 8. Haradatta remarks that
this Sûtra refers to the case where the spokesmen of a guild may be
suspected of partiality.

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[237:25](sbe0275.htm#fr_1149) Manu XII,
108-113, According to Haradatta this Sûtra refers to particularly
difficult cases.

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[238:26](sbe0275.htm#fr_1150) Âpastamba, II,
5, 11, 4.

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[238:29](sbe0275.htm#fr_1151) Âpastamba II, 5,
11, 10.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[238:30](sbe0275.htm#fr_1152) Âpastamba II, 5,
11. 'Perish, i.e. fall from one misfortune info the other.'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[238:31](sbe0275.htm#fr_1153) Âpastamba II, 5,
10, 12-16.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[238:32](sbe0275.htm#fr_1154) Manu VII, 8.
