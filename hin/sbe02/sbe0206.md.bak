cloth). Thus says a Brâhma*n*a. <span id="fr_153"></span>[9](#fn_152.md)

10\. But (I, Âpastamba, say), let him wear a skin only as his upper
garment. <span id="fr_154"></span>[10](#fn_153.md)

and Abhi*s*astas. <span id="fr_160"></span>[25](#fn_159.md)

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

A Brâhma*n*a declares: Since a devout student takes away from women, who
refuse (to give him alms, the merit gained) by (*S*rauta)-sacrifices, by
gifts, (and) by burnt-offerings (offered in the domestic fire), as well
as their offspring, their cattle, the sacred learning (of their
families), therefore, indeed, (a woman) should not refuse (alms) to the
crowd of students; for amongst those (who come to beg), there might be
one of that (devout) kind, one who thus (conscientiously) keeps his vow.

27\. Alms (shall) not (be considered) leavings (and be rejected) by
inference from their appearance), but on the strength of ocular or oral
testimony (only). <span id="fr_161"></span>[27](#fn_160.md)

28\. A Brâhma*n*a shall beg, prefacing (his request) by the word
'Lady'; <span id="fr_162"></span>[28](#fn_161.md)

29\. A Kshatriya (inserting the word) 'Lady' in the middle (between the
words 'give alms');

30\. A Vai*s*ya, adding the word 'Lady' (at the end of the formula).

31\. (The pupil) having taken those (alms) shall place them before his
teacher and offer them to him. <span id="fr_163"></span>[31](#fn_162.md)

32\. He may eat (the food) after having been ordered to do so by his
teacher. <span id="fr_164"></span>[32](#fn_163.md)

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

33\. If the teacher is absent, the pupil (shall offer the food) to (a
member of) the teacher's family.

34\. If the (family of the teacher) is (also) absent, the pupil (may
offer the food) to other learned Brâhma*n*as (*S*rotriyas) also (and
receive from them the permission to eat). <span
id="fr_165"></span>[34](#fn_164.md)

35\. He shall not beg for his own sake (alone). <span
id="fr_166"></span>[35](#fn_165.md)

36\. After he has eaten, he himself shall clean his dish. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[36](#fn_166.md)

37\. And he shall leave no residue (in his dish).

38\. If he cannot (eat all that he has taken in his dish), he shall bury
(the remainder) in the ground;

39\. Or he may throw it into the water;

40\. Or he may place (all that remains in a pot), and put it down near
an (uninitiated) Ârya; <span id="fr_168"></span>[40](#fn_167.md)

41\. Or (he may put it down) near a *S*ûdra slave (belonging to his
teacher).

42\. If (the pupil) is on a journey, he shall throw <span
id="fr_169"></span>[42](#fn_168.md)

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

a part of the alms into the fire and eat (the remainder).

43\. Alms are declared to be sacrificial food. In regard to them the
teacher (holds the position which) a deity (holds in regard to food
offered at a sacrifice).

44\. And (the teacher holds also the place which) the Âhavanîya fire
occupies (at a sacrifice, because a portion of the alms is offered in
the fire of his stomach). <span id="fr_170"></span>[44](#fn_169.md)

45\. To him (the teacher) the (student) shall offer (a portion of the
alms),

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_151"></span>[10:3](sbe0206.htm#fr_152.md) **3**. Manu II, 41;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 29; Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I, 19, 10.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[10:9](sbe0206.htm#fr_153.md) See also
Gopatha-brâhma*n*a I, 2, 4.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[10:10](sbe0206.htm#fr_154.md) According to I, 1,
2, 39-I, 1, 3, 10, the rule of dress for students is the
following:--According to Âpastamba, a student shall wear a piece of
cloth to cover his nakedness (lango*t*î), and a skin as upper garment.
Other teachers allow, besides, an upper dress of cloth, coloured
differently for the different castes, with or without the addition of a
deer-skin.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[10:11](sbe0206.htm#fr_155.md) Manu II, 178.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[10:12](sbe0206.htm#fr_156.md)-13. Manu III, 179;
Yâ*gñ*. I, 33.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[11:15](sbe0206.htm#fr_157.md) 'Anything for his
own pleasure,' i.e. keeping conversations with friends, making his
toilet, &c.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[11:19](sbe0206.htm#fr_158.md) The explanations of
the last two terms, *s*ânta (Sûtra 18) and dânta (Sûtra 19), are
different from those given usually. *S*ama is usually explained as 'the
exclusive direction of the mind towards God,' and dama as 'the
restraining of the senses.'

<span id="fn_158"></span>[11:23](sbe0206.htm#fr_159.md) Manu II, 178.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[11:25](sbe0206.htm#fr_160.md) Regarding the
explanation of the term Abhi*s*asta, see below, I, 7, 21, 17. Haradatta:
'Apapâtras are called those born from a high-caste mother and a
low-caste father, such as washermen. For their cooking vessels &c. are
unfit for the use of the four castes. . . . Since Âpastamba says, In the
evening and in the morning, food obtained in the evening must not be
used for the morning meal, nor food obtained in the morning for the
evening meal."' Manu II, 182, 183, 185; Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I, 22, 4. See
also Gopatha-brâhma*n*a I, 2, 6.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[12:27](sbe0206.htm#fr_161.md) To eat the residue
of the meal of any person except that left by the teacher and other
Gurus, is not permitted to a student; see also below, I, 1, 4, 1 seq.;
Manu II, 56; Yâ*gñ*. I, 33.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[12:28](sbe0206.htm#fr_162.md) The formula to be
used by a Brâhma*n*a is, 'Lady, give alms;' that to be used by a
Kshatriya, 'Give, lady, alms;' and that used by a Vai*s*ya, 'Give alms,
lady.' Manu II, 49; Yâ*gñ*. I, 30; Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I, 22, 8.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[12:31](sbe0206.htm#fr_163.md) The words with
which be announces the alms are, Idam ittham âh*ri*tam, 'this much have
I received.' Manu II, 51; Yâ*gñ*. I, 2, 7; Â*s*v. G*ri*. Sû. I, 22, 10.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[12:32](sbe0206.htm#fr_164.md) The answer of the
teacher is, Saumya tvameva bhuṅkshva, 'friend, eat thou.'

<span id="fn_164"></span>[13:34](sbe0206.htm#fr_165.md) Regarding the term
*S*rotriya, see below, II, 3, 6. 4.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[13:35](sbe0206.htm#fr_166.md) 'The meaning of
this Sûtra is, that the rule given, Sûtra 42 (below), for a pupil who is
on a journey, shall hold good also for a pupil who is at home, if (in
the absence of his teacher) no *S*rotriyas are to be found (from whom he
can receive the permission to eat).'--Haradatta.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[13:36](sbe0206.htm#fr_167.md) 'He commits no sin,
if he has the alms-pot cleaned by somebody else. Some say that the Sûtra
refers to both vessels (the alms-pot and his own dish).'

<span id="fn_167"></span>[13:40](sbe0206.htm#fr_168.md) An Ârya is a person
belonging to one of the first three castes (see below). The Ârya must be
a boy who is not initiated, because children are kâmabhakshâ*h*, i.e.
allowed to eat what they like, even leavings.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[13:42](sbe0206.htm#fr_169.md) This rule holds
good if no *S*rotriyas are near. If *S*rotriyas are to be found, Sûtra
34 applies. Agni, the god of fire, is considered to be of the
Brahminical caste, and hence he takes the place of the teacher or of the
*S*rotriyas. See also Manu II, 247, <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> 248,
and the passages collected from the Brâhma*n*as, by Prof. Weber, Ind.
Stud. IX, 39.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[14:44](sbe0206.htm#fr_170.md) Manu II, 231.
