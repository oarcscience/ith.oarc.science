Gurus, i.e. parents and other venerable persons.

<span id="fn_1297"></span>[265:5](sbe0281.htm#fr_1298.md) Âpastamba I, 6,
18, 14.

<span id="fn_1298"></span>[265:6](sbe0281.htm#fr_1299.md) Manu IV, 253;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 166.

<span id="fn_1299"></span>[266:7](sbe0281.htm#fr_1300.md) E.g. a man who
sells pots, but does not make them.

<span id="fn_1300"></span>[266:8](sbe0281.htm#fr_1301.md) Manu III, 104;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 112.

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[266:9](sbe0281.htm#fr_1302.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
16, 23, 26.

<span id="fn_1302"></span>[266:10](sbe0281.htm#fr_1303.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
16, 27, 30. Haradatta explains 'a black bird' by 'a crow,' and no doubt
the crow, as the *K*â*nd*âla among birds, is intended in the first
instance.

<span id="fn_1303"></span>[266:11](sbe0281.htm#fr_1304.md) Manu IV, 208;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 167.

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[266:12](sbe0281.htm#fr_1305.md) Manu IV, 209;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 168.

<span id="fn_1305"></span>[266:13](sbe0281.htm#fr_1306.md) 'What has been
given in a contemptuous manner by the host, or what is not pleasing to
the eater, that is called bhâvadush*t*a, "naturally bad."'--Haradatta.
The second seems to be the right explanation, as food falling under the
first is mentioned below, Sûtra 21.

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[266:14](sbe0281.htm#fr_1307.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 18, 20.

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[266:15](sbe0281.htm#fr_1308.md) Haradatta states
that this rule does not refer to dishes the preparation of which
requires a double cooking, but to those which ordinarily are cooked once
only.

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[266:16](sbe0281.htm#fr_1309.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 17. Haradatta says that food prepared <span id="page_267">p.
267</span> for the morning meal and kept until supper is also called
parvushita, 'stale.'

<span id="fn_1309"></span>[267:17](sbe0281.htm#fr_1310.md) For this and the
following Sûtras, see Âpastamba I, 6, 18, 16-1, 6, 19, 1; Manu IV,
205-217; Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 161-165. An Abhi*s*asta is a person who is
wrongly or falsely accused of a heinous crime, see Âpastamba I, 91 24,
6-9. Haradatta adduces the explanation 'hermaphrodite' for anapade*s*ya
as the opinion of others. He himself thinks that it means 'a person not
worthy to be described or named.' 'One who hunts without using the bow'
is a poacher who snares animals. Snaring animals is a favourite
occupation of the non-Aryan tribes, such as Vâghrîs, Bhils, and Kolis.

<span id="fn_1310"></span>[267:18](sbe0281.htm#fr_1311.md) See above, XV,
15-18, where 'bald men' occupy the fourteenth place in Sûtra 18.

<span id="fn_1311"></span>[267:19](sbe0281.htm#fr_1312.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 3; Manu IV, 212. That is called 'food (prepared) for no (sacred)
purpose which a man cooks only for himself, not for guests and the rest,
see Âpastamba II, 4, 8, 4; Manu V, 7.

<span id="fn_1312"></span>[267:20](sbe0281.htm#fr_1313.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 2.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[268:21](sbe0281.htm#fr_1314.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 4.

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[268:22](sbe0281.htm#fr_1315.md)-23. Âpastamba I,
5, 17, 24

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[268:24](sbe0281.htm#fr_1316.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 23.

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[268:25](sbe0281.htm#fr_1317.md) Âpastamba, I, 5,
17, 23

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[268:26](sbe0281.htm#fr_1318.md) Manu V, 8;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 170.

<span id="fn_1318"></span>[268:27](sbe0281.htm#fr_1319.md) Âpastamba. I, 5,
17, 37.

<span id="fn_1319"></span>[268:28](sbe0281.htm#fr_1320.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 29, 33, 35. Haradatta gives as an example of 'animals covered with
an excessive quantity of hair' the Yak or Bos grunniens, and of 'those
that have no hair' snakes and the like.

<span id="fn_1320"></span>[269:29](sbe0281.htm#fr_1321.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 29, 32, 34, 35; Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 173.

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[269:30](sbe0281.htm#fr_1322.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 29-30.

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[269:31](sbe0281.htm#fr_1323.md)
Aitareya-brâhma*n*a VII, 14. For the explanation of v*ri*thâ-mâ*m*sa,
'the flesh (of animals killed) for no (sacred) purpose,' Haradatta
refers back to Sûtra 19, but see also the Petersburg Dict. s. v.
v*ri*thâ.

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[269:32](sbe0281.htm#fr_1324.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 26, 29; Manu V, 5, 6, 19.

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[269:34](sbe0281.htm#fr_1325.md) Manu V, 12;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 173, Haradatta explains mândhâla by vâgvada, which
seems to be the same as the bird vâgguda, (Manu XII, 64). Mândhâla is
not found in our dictionaries, but it apparently is a vicarious form for
mânthâla, which occurs in the Vâ*g*asaneyi-Sa*m*hitâ and is said to be
the name of a kind of mouse or rat, It seems to me that the large
herbivorous bat, usually called the flying fox (in Gu*g*arâtî vâgud or
vâgul) is really meant, which, by an inaccurate observer, might be
described both as a bird and as a kind of rat. See also Vasish*th*a XIV,
48.

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[269:35](sbe0281.htm#fr_1326.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 32-33.

<span id="fn_1326"></span>[269:36](sbe0281.htm#fr_1327.md) Âpastamba I, 5,
17, 38-39.

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[270:37](sbe0281.htm#fr_1328.md) I.e. animals
offered at *S*râddhas and *S*rauta-sacrifices, though under other
circumstances forbidden, may be eaten both by the priests and other
Brâhma*n*as.

<span id="fn_1328"></span>[270:38](sbe0281.htm#fr_1329.md) Haradatta takes
vyâla, 'beasts of prey,' to mean sporting dogs, which no doubt are also
intended.
