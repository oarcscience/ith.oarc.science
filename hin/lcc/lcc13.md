### ACT THE SEVENTH

#### ARYAKA'S ESCAPE

\[*Enter Chārudatta and Maitreya*.\]

*Maitreya*.

HOW beautiful the old garden Pushpakaranda is.

*Chārudatta*. You are quite right, my friend. For see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The trees, like merchants, show their wares;  
Each several tree his blossoms bears,  
While bees, like officers, are flitting,  
To take from each what toll is fitting.<span class="margnote">1</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. This simple stone is very attractive. Pray be seated.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Seats himself*.\] How Vardhamānaka lingers, my friend!

*Maitreya*. I told Vardhamānaka to bring Vasantasenā and come as quickly
as he could.

*Chārudatta*. Why then does he linger?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Is he delayed by some slow-moving load?  
  Has he returned with broken wheel or traces?  
Obstructions bid him seek another road?  
  His bullocks, or himself, choose these slow paces?<span
class="margnote">2</span>

</div>

\[*Enter Vardhamānaka with the bullock-cart, in which Aryaka lies
hidden*.\]

*Vardhamānaka*. Get up, bullocks, get up!

*Aryaka*. \[*Aside*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And still I fear the spies that serve the king;  
Escape is even yet a doubtful thing,  
While to my foot these cursèd fetters cling.

Some good man ’tis, within whose cart I lie,  
Like cuckoo chicks, whose heartless mothers fly,  
And crows must rear the fledglings, or they die.<span
class="margnote">3</span>

</div>

I have come a long distance from the city. Shall I get out of the

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

cart and seek a hiding-place in the grove? or shall I wait to see the
owner of the cart? On second thoughts, I will not hide myself in the
grove; for men say that the noble Chārudatta is ever helpful to them
that seek his protection. I will not go until I have seen him face to
face.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

’Twill bring contentment to that good man's heart  
To see me rescued from misfortune's sea.  
This body, in its suffering, pain, and smart,  
Is saved through his sweet magnanimity.<span class="margnote">4</span>

</div>

*Vardhamānaka*. Here is the garden. I'll drive in. \[*He does so*.\]
Maitreya!

*Maitreya*. Good news, my friend. It is Vardhamānaka's voice.
Vasantasenā must have come.

*Chārudatta*. Good news, indeed.

*Maitreya*. You son of a slave, what makes you so late?

*Vardhamānaka*. Don't get angry, good Maitreya. I remembered that I had
forgotten the cushion, and I had to go back for it, and that is why I am
late.

*Chārudatta*. Turn the cart around, Vardhamānaka. Maitreya, my friend,
help Vasantasenā to get out.

*Maitreya*. Has she got fetters on her feet, so that she can't get out
by herself? \[*He rises and lifts the curtain of the cart*.\] Why, this
isn't mistress Vasantasenā—this is Mister Vasantasena.

*Chārudatta*. A truce to your jests, my friend. Love cannot wait. I will
help her to get out myself. \[*He rises*.\]

*Aryaka*. \[*Discovers him*.\] Ah, the owner of the bullock-cart! He is
attractive not only to the ears of men, but also to their eyes. Thank
heaven! I am safe.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Enters the bullock-cart and discovers Aryaka*.\] Who
then is this?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

As trunk of elephant his arms are long,  
His chest is full, his shoulders broad and strong, <span
id="page_107">p. 107</span>  
  His great eyes restless-red; <span id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_70.md)  
Why should this man be thus enforced to fight—  
So noble he—with such ignoble plight,  
  His foot to fetters wed?<span class="margnote">5</span>

</div>

Who are you, sir?

*Aryaka*. I am one who seeks your protection, Aryaka, by birth a
herdsman.

*Chārudatta*. Are you he whom King Pālaka took from the hamlet where he
lived and thrust into prison?

*Aryaka*. The same.

*Chārudatta*. ’Tis fate that brings you to my sight;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

May I be reft of heaven's light,  
Ere I desert you in your hapless plight.<span class="margnote">6</span>

</div>

\[*Aryaka manifests his joy*.\]

*Chārudatta*. Vardhamānaka, remove the fetters from his foot.

*Vardhamānaka*. Yes, sir. \[*He does so*.\] Master, the fetters are
removed.

*Aryaka*. But you have bound me with yet stronger fetters of love.

*Maitreya*. Now you may put on the fetters yourself. He is free anyway.
And it's time for us to be going.

*Chārudatta*. Peace! For shame!

*Aryaka*. Chārudatta, my friend, I entered your cart somewhat
unceremoniously. I beg your pardon.

*Chārudatta*. I feel honored that you should use no ceremony with me.

*Aryaka*. If you permit it, I now desire to go.

*Chārudatta*. Go in peace.

*Aryaka*. Thank you. I will alight from the cart.

*Chārudatta*. No, my friend. The fetters have but this moment been
removed, and you will find walking difficult. In this spot

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

where men seek pleasure, a bullock-cart will excite no suspicion.
Continue your journey then in the cart.

*Aryaka*. I thank you, sir.

*Chārud*. Seek now thy kinsmen. Happiness be thine!

*Aryaka*. Ah, I have found thee, blessèd kinsman mine!

*Chārud*. Remember me, when thou hast cause to speak.

*Aryaka*. Thy name, and not mine own, my words shall seek.

*Chārud*. May the immortal gods protect thy ways!

*Aryaka*. Thou didst protect me, in most perilous days.

*Chārud*. Nay, it was fate that sweet protection lent.

*Aryaka*. But thou wast chosen as fate's instrument.<span
class="margnote">7</span>

*Chārudatta*. King Pālaka is aroused, and protection will prove
difficult. You must depart at once.

*Aryaka*. Until we meet again, farewell.

\[*Exit*.

*Chārud*. From royal wrath I now have much to fear;

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It were unwise for me to linger here.  
Then throw the fetters in the well; for spies  
Serve to their king as keen, far-seeing eyes.<span
class="margnote">8</span>

</div>

\[*His left eye twitches*.\] Maitreya, my friend, I long to see
Vasantasenā. For now, because

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I have not seen whom I love best,  
My left eye twitches; and my breast  
Is causeless-anxious and distressed.<span class="margnote">9</span>

</div>

Come, let us go. \[*He walks about*.\] See! a Buddhist monk approaches,
and the sight bodes ill. \[*Reflecting*.\] Let him enter by that path,
while we depart by this.

\[*Exit*.
