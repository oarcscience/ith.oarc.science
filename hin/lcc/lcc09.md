### ACT THE THIRD

#### THE HOLE IN THE WALL

\[*Enter Chārudatta's servant, Vardhamānaka*.\]

*Vardh*. MASTER, kindly and benevolent,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  His servants love, however poor he be.  
The purse-proud, with a will on harshness bent,  
  Pays service in the coin of cruelty.<span class="margnote">1</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A bullock greedy for a feast of corn  
  You never can prevent;  
A wife who wants her lord to wear a horn  
  You never can prevent;  
A man who loves to gamble night and morn  
  You never can prevent;  
And blemishes <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43) that with a man are
born  
  You never can prevent.<span class="margnote">2</span>

</div>

It is some time since Chārudatta went to the concert. It is past
midnight, and still he does not come. I think I will go into the outer
hall and take a nap. \[*He does so*.\]

 

\[*Enter Chārudatta and Maitreya*.\]

*Chārudatta*. How beautifully Rebhila sang! The lute is indeed a pearl,
a pearl not of the ocean.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Gently the anxious lover's heart befriending,  
  Consoling when true lovers may not meet,  
To love-lorn souls the dearest comforts sending,  
  It adds to sweetest love its more of sweet.<span
class="margnote">3</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. Well then, let's go into the house.

*Chārudatta*. But how wonderfully Master Rebhila sang!

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

*Maitreya*. There are just two things that always make me laugh. One is
a woman talking Sanskrit, and the other is a man who tries to sing soft
and low. Now when a woman talks Sanskrit, she is like a heifer with a
new rope through her nose; all you hear is "soo, soo, soo." And when a
man tries to sing soft and low, he reminds me of an old priest muttering
texts, while the flowers in his chaplet dry up. No, I don't like it!

*Chārudatta*. My friend, Master Rebhila sang most wonderfully this
evening. And still you are not satisfied.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The notes of love, peace, sweetness, could I trace,  
  The note that thrills, the note of passion too,  
The note of woman's loveliness and grace—  
  Ah, my poor words add nothing, nothing new!  
But as the notes in sweetest cadence rang,  
I thought it was my hidden love who sang.<span class="margnote">4</span>

The melody of song, the stricken strings  
In undertone that half-unconscious clings,  
More clearly sounding when the passions rise,  
But ever sweeter as the music dies.  
Words that strong passion fain would say again,  
Yet checks their second utterance—in vain;  
For music sweet as this lives on, until  
I walk as hearing sweetest music still.<span class="margnote">5</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. But see, my friend! The very dogs are sound asleep in the
shops that look out on the market. Let us go home. \[*He looks before
him*.\] Look, look! The blessèd moon seems to give place to darkness, as
she descends from her palace in heaven.

*Chārudatta*. True.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The moon gives place to darkness as she dips  
Behind the western mountain; and the tips  
Of her uplifted horns alone appear,  
Like two sharp-pointed tusks uplifted clear, <span id="page_45">p.
45</span>  
Where bathes an elephant in waters cool,  
Who shows naught else above the jungle pool.<span
class="margnote">6</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. Well, here is our house. Vardhamānaka, Vardhamānaka, open
the door!

*Vardhamānaka*. I hear Maitreya's voice. Chārudatta has returned. I must
open the door for him. \[*He does so*.\] Master, I salute you. Maitreya,
I salute you too. The couch is ready. Pray be seated.

\[*Chārudatta and Maitreya enter and seat themselves*.\]

*Maitreya*. Vardhamānaka, call Radanikā to wash our feet.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Compassionately*.\] She sleeps. Do not wake her.

*Vardhamānaka*. I will bring the water, Maitreya, and you may wash
Chārudatta's feet.

*Maitreya*. \[*Angrily*.\] Look, man. He acts like the son of a slave
that he is, for he is bringing water. But he makes me wash your feet,
and I am a Brahman.

*Chārudatta*. Good Maitreya, do you bring the water, and Vardhamānaka
shall wash my feet.

*Vardhamānaka*. Yes, Maitreya. Do you bring the water. \[*Maitreya does
so. Vardhamānaka washes Chārudatta's feet, then moves away*.\]

*Chārudatta*. Let water be brought for the Brahman's feet.

*Maitreya*. What good does water do my feet? I shall have to roll in the
dirt again, like a beaten ass.

*Vardhamānaka*. Maitreya, you are a Brahman.

*Maitreya*. Yes, like a slow-worm among all the other snakes, so am I a
Brahman among all the other Brahmans.

*Vardhamānaka*. Maitreya, I will wash your feet after all. \[*He does
so*.\] Maitreya, this golden casket I was to keep by day, you by night.
Take it.

\[*He gives it to Maitreya, then exit*.

*Maitreya*. \[*Receiving the casket*.\] The thing is here still. Isn't
there a single thief in Ujjayinī to steal the wretch that robs me of my
sleep? Listen. I am going to take it into the inner court.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

*Chārud*. Such lax attention we can ill afford.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  If we are trusted by a courtezan,  
  Then, Brahman, prove yourself an honest man,  
And guard it safely, till it be restored.<span class="margnote">7</span>

</div>

\[*He nods, repeating the stanza* "The melody of song, the stricken
strings:" *page* [44](#page_44).\]

*Maitreya*. Are you going to sleep?

*Chārudatta*. Yes, so it seems.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For conquering sleep, descending on mine eyes,  
  First smites the brow with unresisted blow;  
Unseen, elusive, like old age, she tries  
  To gather strength by weakening her foe.<span
class="margnote">8</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. Then let's go to sleep. \[*He does so*.\]

 

\[*Enter Sharvilaka*. <span id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44)\]

*Sharv*. I made an entrance for my body's round

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  By force of art and arms, a path to deeds!  
I skinned my sides by crawling on the ground,  
Like a snake that sloughs the skin no longer sound;  
  And now I go where my profession leads.<span class="margnote">9</span>

</div>

\[*He gazes at the sky. Joyfully*.\] See! The blessèd moon is setting.
For well I know,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My trade would fain from watchmen's eyes be shrouded;  
  Valiant, I force the dwelling of another.  
But see, the stars in deepest dark are clouded,  
  And the night shields me like a careful mother.<span
class="margnote">10</span>

</div>

I made a breach in the orchard wall and entered. And now I must force my
way into the inner court as well.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Yes, let men call it vulgar, if they will,  
  The trade that thrives while sleeps the sleepyhead;  
Yes, knavery, not bravery, call it still,  
  To overreach confiding folk a-bed. <span id="page_47">p. 47</span>  
Far better blame and hissing, fairly won,  
  Than the pay of genuflecting underlings;  
This antique path was trod by Drona's son,  
  Who slew the sleeping, unsuspecting kings.<span
class="margnote">11</span>

</div>

But where shall I make the breach?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Where is the spot which falling drops decayed?  
  For each betraying sound is deadened there.  
No yawning breach should in the walls be made,  
  So treatises on robbery declare.  
Where does the palace crumble? Where the place  
  That niter-eaten bricks false soundness wear?  
Where shall I ’scape the sight of woman's face?  
  Fulfilment of my wishes waits me there.<span
class="margnote">12</span>

</div>

\[*He feels the wall*.\] Here is a spot weakened by constant sun and
sprinkling and eaten by saltpeter rot. And here is a pile of dirt thrown
up by a mouse. Now heaven be praised! My venture prospers. This is the
first sign of success for Skanda's <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45)
sons. Now first of all, how shall I make the breach? The blessed Bearer
of the Golden Lance <span id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46) has prescribed
four varieties of breach, thus: if the bricks are baked, pull them out;
if they are unbaked, cut them; if they are made of earth, wet them; if
they are made of wood, split them. Here we have baked bricks; ergo, pull
out the bricks.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now what shall be the shape I give the breach?  
A "lotus," "cistern," "crescent moon," or "sun"?  
"Oblong," or "cross," or "bulging pot"? for each  
The treatises permit. Which one? which one?  
And where shall I display my sovereign skill,  
That in the morning men may wonder still?<span
class="margnote">13</span>

</div>

In this wall of baked bricks, the "bulging pot" would be effective. I
will make that.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

At other walls that I have pierced by night,  
  And at my less successful ventures too,  
The crowd of neighbors gazed by morning light,  
  Assigning praise or blame, as was my due.<span
class="margnote">14</span>

</div>

Praise to the boon-conferring god, to Skanda of immortal youth! Praise
to him, the Bearer of the Golden Lance, the Brahman's god, the pious!
Praise to him, the Child of the Sun! Praise to him, the teacher of
magic, whose first pupil I am! For he found plea- sure in me and gave me
magic ointment,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

With which so I anointed be,  
No watchman's eye my form shall see;  
And edgèd sword that falls on me  
From cruel wounds shall leave me free.<span class="margnote">15</span>

</div>

\[*He anoints himself*.\] Alas, I have forgotten my measuring line.
\[*Reflecting*.\] Aha! This sacred cord <span
id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47) shall be my measuring line. Yes, the
sacred cord is a great blessing to a Brahman, especially to one like me.
For, you see,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

With this he measures, ere he pierce a wall,  
  And picks the lock, when jewels are at stake.  
It serves as key to bolted door and hall,  
  As tourniquet for bite of worm and snake.<span
class="margnote">16</span>

</div>

The measuring is done. I begin my task. \[*He does so, then takes a
look*.\] My breach lacks but a single brick. Alas, I am bitten by a
snake. \[*He binds his finger with the sacred cord, and manifests the
workings of poison*.\] I have applied the remedy, and now I am restored.
\[*He continues his work, then gazes*.\] Ah, there burns a candle. See!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Though jealous darkness hems it round,  
  The golden-yellow candle from its place  
Shines through the breach upon the ground,  
  Like a streak of gold upon the touchstone's face.<span
class="margnote">17</span>

</div>

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

\[*He returns to his work*.\] The breach is finished. Good! I enter. But
no, I will not enter yet. I will shove a dummy in. \[*He does so*.\] Ah,
no one is there. Praise be to Skanda! \[*He enters and looks about*.\]
See! Two men asleep. Come, for my own protection I will open the door.
But the house is old and the door squeaks. I must look for water. Now
where might water be? \[*He looks about, finds water, and sprinkles the
door. Anxiously*.\] I hope it will not fall upon the floor and make a
noise. Come, this is the way. \[*He puts his back against the door and
opens it cautiously*.\] Good! So much for that. Now I must discover
whether these two are feigning sleep, or whether they are asleep in the
fullest meaning of the term. \[*He tries to terrify them, and notes the
effect*.\] Yes, they must be asleep in the fullest meaning of the term.
For see!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Their breath first calmly rises, ere it sink;  
  Its regularity all fear defies.  
  Unmoving in their socket-holes, the eyes  
Are tightly closed, and never seem to wink.  
The limbs relaxed, at ease the bodies lie,  
  I see their feet beyond the bedstead peep,  
The lighted candle vexes not the eye;  
  It would, if they were only feigning sleep.<span
class="margnote">18</span>

</div>

\[*He looks about him*.\] What! a drum? And here is a flute. And here, a
snare-drum. And here, a lute. And reed-pipes. And yonder, manuscripts.
Is this the house of a dancing-master? But no! When I entered, I was
convinced that this was a palatial residence. Now then, is this man poor
in the fullest meaning of the term, or, from fear of the king or of
thieves, does he keep his property buried? Well, my own property is
buried, too. But I will scatter the seeds that betray subterranean gold.
\[*He does so*.\] The scattered seeds nowhere swell up. Ah, he is poor
in the fullest meaning of the term. Good! I go.

Maitreya. \[*Talking in his sleep*.\] Look, man. I see something like

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

a hole in the wall. I see something like a thief. You had better take
this golden casket.

*Sharvilaka*. I wonder if the man has discovered that I have entered,
and is showing off his poverty in order to make fun of me. Shall I kill
him, or is the poor devil talking in his sleep? \[*He takes a look*.\]
But see! This thing wrapped in a ragged bath-clout, now that I inspect
it by the light of my candle, is in truth a jewel-casket. Suppose I take
it. But no! It is hardly proper to rob a man of good birth, who is as
poor as I am. I go.

*Maitreya*. My friend, by the wishes of cows and Brahmans <span
id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48) I conjure you to take this golden casket.

*Sharvilaka*. One may not disregard the sacred wish of a cow and the
wish of a Brahman. I will take it. But look! There burns the candle. I
keep about me a moth for the express purpose of extinguishing candles. I
will let him enter the flame. This is his place and hour. May this moth
which I here release, depart to flutter above the flame in varying
circles. The breeze from the insect's wings has translated the flame
into accursèd darkness. Or shall I not rather curse the darkness brought
by me upon my Brahmanic family? For my father was a man who knew the
four Vedas, who would not accept a gift; and I, Sharvilaka, his son, and
a Brahman, I am committing a crime for the sake of that courtezan girl
Madanikā. Now I will grant the Brahman's wish. \[*He reaches out for the
casket*.\]

Maitreya. How cold your fingers are, man!

*Sharvilaka*. What carelessness! My fingers are cold from touching
water. Well, I will put my hand in my armpit. \[*He warms his left hand
and takes the casket*.\]

*Maitreya*. Have you got it?

*Sharvilaka*. I could not refuse a Brahman's request. I have it.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

*Maitreya*. Now I shall sleep as peacefully as a merchant who has sold
his wares.

*Sharvilaka*. O great Brahman, sleep a hundred years! Alas that a
Brahman family should thus be plunged in darkness for the sake of
Madanikā, a courtezan! Or better, I myself am thus plunged in darkness.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A curse on poverty, I say!  
  ’Tis stranger to the manly will;  
This act that shuns the light of day  
  I curse indeed, but do it still.<span class="margnote">19</span>

</div>

Well then, I must go to Vasantasenā's house to buy Madanikā's freedom.
\[*He walks about and looks around him*.\] Ah, I think I hear footsteps.
I hope they are not those of policemen. Never mind. I will pretend to be
a pillar, and wait. But after all, do policemen exist for me, for
Sharvilaka? Why, I am

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A cat for crawling, and a deer for flight,  
A hawk for rending, and a dog for sight  
To judge the strength of men that wake or sleep,  
A snake, when ’tis advisable to creep,  
Illusion's self, to seem a saint or rogue,  
Goddess of Speech in understanding brogue;  
A light in blackest night, in holes a lizard I can be,  
A horse on terra firma, and a ship upon the sea.<span
class="margnote">20</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Quick as a snake, and steady as a hill;  
In flight the prince of birds can show no greater skill;  
In searching on the ground I am as keen as any hare,  
In strength I am a lion, and a wolf to rend and tear.<span
class="margnote">21</span>

</div>

*Radanikā*. \[*Entering*.\] Dear me! Vardhamānaka went to sleep in the
outer court, and now he is not there. Well, I will call Maitreya. \[*She
walks about*.\]

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

*Sharvilaka*. \[*Prepares to strike down Radanikā, but first takes a
look*.\] What! a woman? Good! I go.

\[*Exit*.

 

*Radanikā*. \[*Recoiling in terror*.\] Oh, oh, a thief has cut a hole in
the wall of our house and is escaping. I must go and wake Maitreya.
\[*She approaches Maitreya*.\] Oh, Maitreya, get up, get up! A thief has
cut a hole in the wall of our house and has escaped.

*Maitreya*. \[*Rising*.\] What do you mean, wench? "A hole in the wall
has cut a thief and has escaped"?

*Radanikā*. Poor fool! Stop your joking. Don't you see it?

*Maitreya*. What do you mean, wench? "It looks as if a second door had
been thrown open"? Get up, friend Chārudatta, get up! A thief has made a
hole in the wall of our house and has escaped.

*Chārudatta*. Yes, yes! A truce to your jests!

*Maitreya*. But it isn't a jest. Look!

*Chārudatta*. Where?

*Maitreya*. Why, here.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Gazing*.\] What a very remarkable hole!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The bricks are drawn away below, above;  
  The top is narrow, but the center wide;  
  As if the great house-heart had burst with pride,  
Fearing lest the unworthy share its love.<span
class="margnote">22</span>

</div>

To think that science should be expended on a task like this!

*Maitreya*. My friend, this hole must have been made by one of two men;
either by a stranger, or else for practice by a student of the science
of robbery. For what man here in Ujjayinī does not know how much wealth
there is in our house?

*Chārud*. Stranger he must have been who made the breach,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  His customed harvest in my house to reap;  
He has not learned that vanished riches teach  
  A calm, untroubled sleep. <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>  
He saw the sometime greatness of my home  
  And forced an entrance; for his heart did leap  
With short-lived hope; now he must elsewhere roam,  
  And over broken hopes must sorely weep.<span
class="margnote">23</span>

</div>

Just think of the poor fellow telling his friends: "I entered the house
of a merchant's son, and found—nothing."

*Maitreya*. Do you mean to say that you pity the rascally robber? Thinks
he—"Here's a great house. Here's the place to carry off a jewel-casket
or a gold-casket." \[*He remembers the casket. Despondently. Aside*.\]
Where is that golden casket? \[*He remembers the events of the night.
Aloud*.\] Look, man! You are always saying "Maitreya is a fool, Maitreya
is no scholar." But I certainly acted wisely in handing over that golden
casket to you. If I hadn't, the son of a slave would have carried it
off.

*Chārudatta*. A truce to your jests!

*Maitreya*. Just because I'm a fool, do you suppose I don't even know
the place and time for a jest?

*Chārudatta*. But when did this happen?

*Maitreya*. Why, when I told you that your fingers were cold.

*Chārudatta*. It might have been. \[*He searches about. Joyfully*.\] My
friend, I have something pleasant to tell you.

*Maitreya*. What? Wasn't it stolen?

*Chārudatta*. Yes.

*Maitreya*. What is the pleasant news, then?

*Chārudatta*. The fact that he did not go away disappointed.

*Maitreya*. But it was only entrusted to our care.

*Chārudatta*. What! entrusted to our care? \[*He swoons*.\]

*Maitreya*. Come to yourself, man. Is the fact that a thief stole what
was entrusted to you, any reason why you should swoon?

*Chārudatta*. \[*Coming to himself*.\] Ah, my friend,

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Who will believe the truth?  
  Suspicion now is sure.  
This world will show no ruth  
  To the inglorious poor.<span class="margnote">24</span>

</div>

Alas!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

If envious fate before  
  Has wooed my wealth alone,  
Why should she seek my store  
  Of virtue as her own?<span class="margnote">25</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*. I intend to deny the whole thing. Who gave anybody anything?
who received anything from anybody? who was a witness?

*Chārudatta*. And shall I tell a falsehood now?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

No! I will beg until I earn  
  The wherewithal my debt to pay.  
Ignoble falsehood I will spurn,  
  That steals the character away.<span class="margnote">26</span>

</div>

*Radanikā*. I will go and tell his good wife. \[*She goes out, returning
with Chārudatta's wife*.\]

*Wife*. \[*Anxiously*.\] Oh! Is it true that my lord is uninjured, and
Maitreya too?

*Radanikā*. It is true, mistress. But the gems which belong to the
courtezan have been stolen. \[*Chārudatta's wife swoons*.\] O my good
mistress! Come to yourself!

*Wife*. \[*Recovering*.\] Girl, how can you say that my lord is
uninjured? Better that he were injured in body than in character. For
now the people of Ujjayinī will say that my lord committed this crime
because of his poverty. \[*She looks up and sighs*.\] Ah, mighty Fate!
The destinies of the poor, uncertain as the water-drops which fall upon
a lotus-leaf, seem to thee but playthings. There remains to me this one
necklace, which I brought with me from my mother's house. But my lord
would be too proud to accept it. Girl, call Maitreya hither.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

*Radanikā*. Yes, mistress. \[*She approaches Maitreya*.\] Maitreya, my
lady summons you.

*Maitreya*. Where is she?

*Radanikā*. Here. Come!

*Maitreya*. \[*Approaching*.\] Heaven bless you!

*Wife*. I salute you, sir. Sir, will you look straight in front of you?

*Maitreya*. Madam, here stands a man who looks straight in front of him.

*Wife*. Sir, you must accept this.

*Maitreya*. Why?

*Wife*. I have observed the Ceremony of the Gems. And on this occasion
one must make as great a present as one may to a Brahman. This I have
not done, therefore pray accept this necklace.

*Maitreya*. \[*Receiving the necklace*.\] Heaven bless you! I will go
and tell my friend.

*Wife*. You must not do it in such a way as to make me blush,

*Maitreya*.

\[*Exit*.

*Maitreya*. \[*In astonishment*.\] What generosity!

 

*Chārudatta*. How Maitreya lingers! I trust his grief is not leading him
to do what he ought not. Maitreya, Maitreya!

*Maitreya*. \[*Approaching*.\] Here I am. Take that. \[*He displays the
necklace*.\]

*Chārudatta*. What is this?

*Maitreya*. Why, that is the reward you get for marrying such a wife.

*Chārudatta*. What! my wife takes pity on me? Alas, now am I poor
indeed!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When fate so robs him of his all,  
That on her pity he must call,  
The man to woman's state doth fall,  
  The woman is the man.<span class="margnote">27</span>

</div>

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

But no, I am not poor. For I have a wife

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Whose love outlasts my wealthy day;  
  In thee a friend through good and ill;  
And truth that naught could take away:  
  Ah, this the poor man lacketh still.<span class="margnote">28</span>

</div>

*Maitreya*, take the necklace and go to Vasantasenā. Tell her in my name
that we have gambled away the golden casket, forgetting that it was not
our own; that we trust she will accept this necklace in its place.

*Maitreya*. But you must not give away this necklace, the pride of the
four seas, for that cheap thing that was stolen before we had a bite or
a drink out of it.

*Chārudatta*. Not so, my friend.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

She showed her trust in leaving us her treasure;  
The price of confidence has no less measure.<span
class="margnote">29</span>

</div>

Friend, I conjure you by this gesture, not to return until you have
delivered it into her hands. Vardhamānaka, do you speedily

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Fill up the opening with the selfsame bricks;  
  Thus will I thwart the process of the law,  
For the blemish of so great a scandal sticks.<span
class="margnote">30</span>

</div>

And, friend Maitreya, you must show your pride by not speaking too
despondently.

*Maitreya*. How can a poor man help speaking despondently?

*Chārudatta*. Poor I am not, my friend. For I have a wife

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Whose love outlasts my wealthy day;  
  In thee a friend through good and ill;  
And truth that naught could take away:
