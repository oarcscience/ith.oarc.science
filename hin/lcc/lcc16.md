### ACT THE TENTH

#### THE END

\[*Enter Chārudatta, accompanied by two headsmen*.\]

*Headsmen*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

THEN think no longer of the pain;  
In just a second you'll be slain.  
We understand the fashions new  
To fetter you and kill you too.  
In chopping heads we never fail,  
Nor when the victim we impale.<span class="margnote">1</span>

</div>

Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way! This is the noble Chārudatta.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The oleander on his brow,  
In headsmen's hands you see him now;  
Like a lamp whose oil runs nearly dry,  
His light fades gently, ere it die.<span class="margnote">2</span>

</div>

*Chārudatta*. \[*Gloomily*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My body wet by tear-drops falling, falling;  
My limbs polluted by the clinging mud;  
Flowers from the graveyard torn, my wreath appalling;  
For ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling,  
And for the fragrant incense of my blood.<span class="margnote">3</span>

</div>

*Headsmen*. Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Why gaze upon the good man so?  
The ax of death soon lays him low.  
Yet good men once sought shelter free,  
Like birds, upon this kindly tree.<span class="margnote">4</span>

</div>

Come, Chārudatta, come!

*Chārudatta*. Incalculable are the ways of human destiny, that I am come
to such a plight!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Red marks of hands in sandal paste  
O’er all my body have been placed; <span id="page_154">p. 154</span>  
The man, with meal and powder strewn,  
Is now to beast of offering grown.<span class="margnote">5</span>

</div>

\[*He gazes intently before him*.\] Alas for human differences!
\[*Mournfully*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For when they see the fate that I must brave,  
With tears for death's poor victim freely given,  
The citizens cry "shame," yet cannot save,—  
Can only pray that I attain to heaven.<span class="margnote">6</span>

</div>

*Headsmen*. Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way! Why do you gaze
upon him?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

God Indra moving through the sky, <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84)  
The calving cow, the falling star,  
The good man when he needs must die,—  
These four behold not from afar.<span class="margnote">7</span>

</div>

*Goha*. Look, Ahīnta! Look, man!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

While he, of citizens the best,  
Goes to his death at fate's behest,  
Does heaven thus weep that he must die?  
Does lightning paint the cloudless sky?<span class="margnote">8</span>

</div>

*Ahīnta*. Goha, man,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The heaven weeps not that he must die,  
Nor lightning paints the cloudless sky;  
Yet streams are falling constantly  
From many a woman's clouded eye.<span class="margnote">9</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

While this poor victim to his death is led,  
No man nor woman here but sorely weeps;  
And so the dust, by countless tear-drops fed,  
Thus peacefully upon the highway sleeps.<span class="margnote">10</span>

</div>

*Chārudatta*. \[*Gazes intently. Mournfully*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

These women, in their palaces who stay,  
  From half-shut windows peering, thus lament, <span id="page_155">p.
155</span>  
"Alas for Chārudatta! Woe the day!"  
  And pity-streaming eyes on me are bent.<span
class="margnote">11</span>

</div>

*Headsmen*. Come, Chārudatta, come! Here is the place of proclamation.
Beat the drum and proclaim the sentence.

Listen, good people, listen! This is the noble Chārudatta, son of
Sāgaradatta, and grandson of the merchant Vinayadatta. This malefactor
enticed the courtezan Vasantasenā into the deserted old garden
Pushpakaranda, and for a mere trifle murdered her by strangling. He was
taken with the booty, and confessed his guilt. Therefore are we under
orders from King Pālaka to execute him. And if any other commit such a
crime, accursèd in this world and the next, him too King Pālaka condemns
to the like punishment.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Despondently. Aside*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

By hundred sacrifices purified,  
     My radiant name  
Was once proclaimed by countless altars’ side,  
     And knew no blame.  
Now comes my hour of death, and evil men  
     Of baser fame  
In public spots proclaim it once again,  
     But linked with shame.<span class="margnote">12</span>

</div>

\[*He looks up and stops his ears*.\] Vasantasenā! Oh, my belovèd!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

From thy dear lips, that vied with coral's red,  
  Betraying teeth more bright than moonbeams fair,  
My soul with heaven's nectar once was fed.  
How can I, helpless, taste that poison dread,  
  To drink shame's poisoned cup how can I bear?<span
class="margnote">13</span>

</div>

*Headsmen*. Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This treasure-house, with pearls of virtue stored,  
  This bridge for good men o’er misfortune's river,  
This gem now robbed of all its golden hoard,  
  Departs our town to-day, departs forever.<span
class="margnote">14</span>

</div>

And again:

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Whom fortune favors, find  
That all the world is kind;  
Whose happy days are ended,  
Are rarely thus befriended.<span class="margnote">15</span>

</div>

*Chārudatta*. \[*Looks about him*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Their faces with their garments’ hem now hiding,  
  They stand afar, whom once I counted friends:  
Even foes have smiles for men with Fortune biding;  
  But friends prove faithless when good fortune ends.<span
class="margnote">16</span>

</div>

*Headsmen*. They are out of the way. The street is cleared. Lead on the
condemned criminal.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Sighing*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My friend Maitreya! Oh, this cruel blow!  
  My wife, thou issue of a spotless strain!  
My Rohasena! Here am I, laid low  
By sternest fate; and thou, thou dost not know  
  That all thy childish games are played in vain.  
  Thou playest, heedless of another's pain!<span class="margnote">(ix.
29)</span>

</div>

*Voices behind the scenes*. My father! Oh, my friend!

*Chārudatta*. \[*Listens. Mournfully*.\] You are a leader in your own
caste. I would beg a favor at your hands.

*Headsmen*. From our hands you would receive a favor?

*Chārudatta*. Heaven forbid! Yet a headsman is neither so wanton nor so
cruel as King Pālaka. That I may be happy in the other world, I ask to
see the face of my son.

*Headsmen*. So be it.

*A voice behind the scenes*. My father! oh, my father! \[*Chārudatta
hears the words, and mournfully repeats his request*.\]

*Headsmen*. Citizens, make way a moment. Let the noble Chārudatta look
upon the face of his son. \[*Turning to the back of the stage*.\] This
way, sir! Come on, little boy!

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

\[*Enter Maitreya, with Rohasena*.\]

*Maitreya*. Make haste, my boy, make haste! Your father is being led to
his death.

*Rohasena*. My father! oh, my father!

*Maitreya*. Oh, my friend! Where must I behold you now?

*Chārudatta*. \[*Perceives ins son and his friend*.\] Alas, my son!
Alas, Maitreya! \[*Mournfully*.\] Ah, woe is me!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Long, too long, shall I thirst in vain  
  Through all my sojourn dread;  
This vessel <span id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85) small will not contain  
  The water for the dead.<span class="margnote">17</span>

</div>

What may I give my son? \[*He looks at himself, and perceives the
sacrificial cord*.\] Ah, this at least is mine.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The precious cord that Brahmans hold  
Is unadorned with pearls and gold;  
  Yet, girt therewith, they sacrifice  
To gods above and fathers <span id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_86) old.<span
class="margnote">18</span>

</div>

\[*He gives Rohasena the cord*.\]

*Goha*. Come, Chārudatta! Come, man!

*Ahīnta*. Man, do you name the noble Chārudatta's name, and forget the
title? Remember:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

In happy hours, in death, by night, by day,  
Roving as free as a yet unbroken colt,  
Fate wanders on her unrestricted way.<span class="margnote">19</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Life will depart his body soon;  
Shall our reproaches bow his head?  
Although eclipse may seize the moon,  
We worship while it seems but dead.<span class="margnote">20</span>

</div>

*Rohasena*. Oh, headsmen, where are you leading my father?

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

*Chārudatta*. My darling,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

About my neck I needs must wear  
  The oleander-wreath;  
Upon my shoulder I must bear  
The stake, and in my heart the care  
  Of near-approaching death.  
I go to-day to meet a dastard's ending,  
A victim, at the fatal altar bending.<span class="margnote">21</span>

</div>

*Goha*. My boy,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Not we the headsmen are,  
  Though born of headsman race;  
Thy father's life who mar,  
  These, these are headsmen base.<span class="margnote">22</span>

</div>

*Rohasena*. Then why do you murder my father?

*Goha*. Bless you, ’tis the king's orders must bear the blame, not we.

*Rohasena*. Kill me, and let father go free.

*Goha*. Bless you, may you live long for saying that!

*Chārudatta*. \[*Tearfully embracing his son*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

This treasure—love—this taste of heaven,  
To rich and poor alike is given;  
Than sandal better, or than balm,  
To soothe the heart and give it calm.<span class="margnote">23</span>

About my neck I needs must wear  
The oleander-wreath,  
Upon my shoulder I must bear  
The stake, and in my heart the care  
Of near-approaching death.  
I go to-day to meet a dastard's ending,  
A victim, at the fatal altar bending.<span class="margnote">(21)</span>

\[*He looks about. Aside*.\]

</div>

*Maitreya*. My good men, let my dear friend Chārudatta go free, and kill
me instead.

*Chārudatta*. Heaven forbid! \[*He looks about. Aside*.\] Now I
understand.

*Goha*. Out of the way, gentlemen, out of the way!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Why gaze upon the good man so,  
When shame his living hope lays low?  
The cord was broken at the well,  
And down the golden pitcher fell.<span class="margnote">24</span>

*Ahīnta*. Proclaim the sentence again, man. \[*Goha does so*.\]

*Chārud*. So lowly fallen! till shame my virtues blur,

Till such an ending seem not loss, but gain!

\[*Enter Sthāvaraka, fettered, in the palace tower*.\]

*Sthāvaraka*. \[*After listening to the proclamation. In distress*.\]
What! the innocent Chārudatta is being put to death? And my master has
thrown me into chains! Well, I must shout to them. —Listen, good
gentlemen, listen! It was I, wretch that I am, who

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

carried Vasantasenā to the old garden Pushpakaranda, because she mistook
my bullock-cart for another. And then my master, Sansthānaka, found that
she would not love him, and it was he, not this gentleman, who murdered
her by strangling.—But they are so far away that no one hears me. What
shall I do? Shall I cast myself down? \[*He reflects*.\] If I do, then
the noble Chārudatta will not be put to death. Yes, through this broken
window I will throw myself down from the palace tower. Better that I
should meet my end, than that the noble Chārudatta should perish, this
tree of life for noble youths. And if I die in such a cause, I have
attained heaven. \[*He throws himself down*.\] Wonderful! I did not meet
my end, and my fetters are broken. So I will follow the sound of the
headsmen's voices. \[*He discovers the headsmen, and hastens forward*.\]
Headsmen, headsmen, make way!

*Headsmen*. For whom shall we make way?

*Sthāvaraka*. Listen, good gentlemen, listen! It was I, wretch that I
am, who carried Vasantasenā to the old garden Pushpakaranda, because she
mistook my bullock-cart for another. And then my master, Sansthānaka,
found that she would not love him, and it was he, not this gentleman,
who murdered her by strangling.

*Chārudatta*. Thank heaven!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

But who thus gladdens this my latest morn,  
When in Time's snare I struggle all forlorn,  
A streaming cloud above the rainless corn?<span
class="margnote">26</span>

</div>

Listen! do you hear what I say?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Death have I never feared, but blackened fame;  
My death were welcome, coming free from shame,  
As were a son, new-born to bear my name.<span class="margnote">27</span>

</div>

And again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

That small, weak fool, whom I have never hated,  
Stained me with sin wherewith himself was mated,  
An arrow, with most deadly poison baited.<span
class="margnote">28</span>

</div>

*Headsmen*. Are you telling the truth, Sthāvaraka?

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

*Sthāvaraka*. I am. And to keep me from telling anybody, he cast me into
chains, and imprisoned me in the tower of his palace.

\[*Enter Sansthānaka*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Gleefully*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I ate a shour and bitter dish  
Of meat and herbs and shoup and fish;  
I tried at home my tongue to tickle  
With rice-cakes plain, and rice with treacle.<span
class="margnote">29</span>

</div>

\[*He listens*.\] The headsmen's voices! They shound like a broken brass
cymbal. I hear the music of the fatal drum and the kettledrums, and sho
I shuppose that that poor man, Chārudatta, is being led to the place of
execution. I musht go and shee it. It is a great delight to shee my
enemy die. Beshides, I've heard that a man who shees his enemy being
killed, is sure not to have shore eyes in his next birth. I acted like a
worm that had crept into the knot of a lotush-root. I looked for a hole
to crawl out at, and brought about the death of thish poor man,
Chārudatta. Now I'll climb up the tower of my own palace, and have a
look at my own heroic deeds. \[*He does so and looks about*.\] Wonderful
what a crowd there is, to shee that poor man led to his death! What
would it be when an arishtocrat, a big man like me, was being led to his
death? \[*He gazes*.\] Look! There he goes toward the shouth, adorned
like a young shteer. But why was the proclamation made near my palace
tower, and why was it shtopped? \[*He looks about*.\] Why, my shlave
Sthāvaraka is gone, too. I hope he hasn't run away and betrayed the
shecret. I musht go and look for him. \[*He descends and approaches the
crowd*.\]

*Sthāvaraka*. \[*Discovers him*.\] There he comes, good masters!

*Headsmen*. Give way! Make room! And shut the door!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Be silent, and say nothing more!  
Here comes a mad bull through the press,  
Whose horns are sharp with wickedness.<span class="margnote">30</span>

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

*Sansthānaka*. Come, come, make way! \[*He approaches*.\] Sthāvaraka, my
little shon, my shlave, come, let's go home.

*Sthāvaraka*. You scoundrel! Are you not content with the murder of
Vasantasenā? Must you try now to murder the noble Chārudatta, that tree
of life to all who loved him?

*Sansthānaka*. I am beautiful as a pot of jewels. I kill no woman!

*Bystanders*. Oho! you murdered her, not the noble Chārudatta.

*Sansthānaka*. Who shays that?

*Bystanders*. \[*Pointing to Sthāvaraka*.\] This honest man.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Fearfully. Aside*.\] Merciful heavens! Why didn't I
chain that shlave Sthāvaraka fasht? Why, he was a witnessh of my crime.
\[*He reflects*.\] I'll do it thish way. \[*Aloud*.\] Lies, lies, good
gentlemen. Why, I caught the shlave shtealing gold, and I pounded him,
and murdered him, and put him in chains. He hates me. What he shays
can't be true. \[*He secretly hands Sthāvaraka a bracelet, and
whispers*.\] Sthāvaraka, my little shon, my shlave, take thish and shay
shomething different.

*Sthāvaraka*. \[*Takes it*.\] Look, gentlemen, look! Why, he is trying
to bribe me with gold.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Snatches the bracelet from him*.\] That's the gold
that I put him in chains for. \[*Angrily*.\] Look here, headsmen! I put
him in charge of my gold-chest, and when he turned thief, I murdered him
and pounded him. If you don't believe it, jusht look at his back.

*Headsmen*. \[*Doing so*.\] Yes, yes. When a servant is branded that
way, no wonder he tells tales.

*Sthāvaraka*. A curse on slavery! A slave convinces nobody.
\[*Mournfully*.\] Noble Chārudatta, I have no further power. \[*He falls
at Chārudatta's feet*.\]

*Chārudatta*. \[*Mournfully*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Rise, rise! Kind soul to good men fallen on pain!  
  Brave friend who lendest such unselfish aid! <span id="page_163">p.

  For fate would not. Thy duty now is paid.<span

</div>

*Headsmen*. Beat your servant, master, and drive him away.

*Sansthānaka*. Out of the way, you! \[*He drives Sthāvaraka away*.\]
Come, headsmen, what are you waiting for? Kill him.

*Headsmen*. Kill him yourself, if you are in a hurry.

*Rohasena*. Oh, headsmen, kill me and let father go free.

*Sansthānaka*. Yesh, shon and father, kill them both.

*Chārudatta*. This fool might do anything. Go, my son, to your mother.

*Rohasena*. And what should I do then?

*Chārud*. Go with thy mother to a hermitage;

No moment, dear, delay;  
Lest of thy father's fault thou reap the wage,  
And tread the selfsame way.<span class="margnote">32</span>

And you, my friend, go with him.

*Maitreya*. Oh, my friend, have you so known me as to think that I can
live without you?

*Chārudatta*. Not so, my friend. Your life is your own. You may not
throw it away.

*Maitreya*. \[*Aside*.\] True. And yet I cannot live apart from my
friend. And so, when I have taken the boy to his mother, I will follow
my friend even in death. \[*Aloud*.\] Yes, my friend, I will take him to
her at once. \[*He embraces Chārudatta, then falls at his feet. Rohasena
does the same, weeping*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. Look here! Didn't I tell you to kill Chārudatta, and his
shon, too? \[*At this, Chārudatta betrays fear*.\]

*Headsmen*. We haven't any orders from the king to kill Chārudatta, and
his son, too. Run away, boy, run away! \[*They drive Rohasena away*.\]
Here is the third place of proclamation. Beat the drum! \[*They proclaim
the sentence again*.\]

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Aside*.\] But the citizens don't believe it.
\[*Aloud*.\] Chārudatta, you jackanapes, the citizens don't believe it.
Shay it with your own tongue, "I murdered Vasantasenā." \[*Chārudatta
remains silent*.\] Look here, headsmen! The man won't shpeak, the
jackanapes Chārudatta. Jusht make him shpeak. Beat him a few times with
thish ragged bamboo, or with a chain.

*Goha*. \[*Raises his arm to strike*.\] Come, Chārudatta, speak!

*Chārudatta*. \[*Mournfully*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now am I sunk so deep in sorrow's sea,

*Sansthānaka*. Killed her!

*Chārudatta*. So be it.

*Goha*. It's your turn to kill him, man.

*Ahīnta*. No, yours.

*Goha*. Well, let's reckon it out. \[*He does so at great length*.\]
Well, if it's my turn to kill him, we will just let it wait a minute.

*Ahīnta*. Why?

*Goha*. Well, when my father was going to heaven, he said to me, "Son
Goha, if it's your turn to kill him, don't kill the sinner too quick."

*Ahīnta*. But why?

*Goha*. "Perhaps," said he, "some good man might give the money to set
him free. Perhaps a son might be born to the king, and to celebrate the
event, all the prisoners might be set free. Perhaps

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

an elephant might break loose, and the prisoner might escape in the
excitement. Perhaps there might be a change of kings, and all the
prisoners might be set free."

*Sansthānaka*. What? What? A change of kings?

*Goha*. Well, let's reckon it out, whose turn it is. Sansthānaka. Oh,
come! Kill Chārudatta at once. \[*He takes Sthāvaraka, and withdraws a
little*.\]

*Headsmen*. Noble Chārudatta, it is the king's commandment that bears
the blame, not we headsmen. Think then of what you needs must think.

*Chārudatta*.

*Goha*. Noble Chārudatta, the moon and the sun dwell in the vault of
heaven, yet even they are overtaken by disaster. How much more,
death-fearing creatures, and men! In this world, one rises only to fall,
another falls only to rise again. But from him who has risen and falls,
his body drops like a garment. Lay these thoughts to heart, and be
strong. \[*To Ahīnta*.\] Here is the fourth place of proclamation. Let
us proclaim the sentence. \[*They do so once again*.\]

*Chārudatta*. Vasantasenā! Oh, my belovèd!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

From thy dear lips, that vied with coral's red,  
Betraying teeth more bright than moonbeams fair,  
My soul with heaven's nectar once was fed.  
How can I, helpless, taste that poison dread,  
To drink shame's poisoned cup how can I bear?<span

</div>

\[*Enter, in great agitation, Vasantasenā and the Buddhist monk*.\]

*Monk*. Strange! My monkish life did me yeoman service when it proved
necessary to comfort Vasantasenā, so untimely wearied, and to lead her
on her way. Sister in Buddha, whither shall I lead you? Vasantasenā. To
the noble Chārudatta's house. Revive me with the sight of him, as the
night-blooming water-lily is revived by the sight of the moon.

*Monk*. \[*Aside*.\] By which road shall I enter? \[*He reflects*.\] The
king's highway—I'll enter by that. Come, sister in Buddha! Here is the
king's highway. \[*Listening*.\] But what is this great tumult that I
hear on the king's highway?

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Looking before her*.\] Why, there is a great crowd of
people before us. Pray find out, sir, what it means. All Ujjayinī tips
to one side, as if the earth bore an uneven load.

 

*Goha*. And here is the last place of proclamation. Beat the drum!
Proclaim the sentence! \[*They do so*.\] Now, Chārudatta, wait! Don't be
frightened. You will be killed very quickly.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

*Chārudatta*. Ye blessèd gods!

*Monk*. \[*Listens. In terror*.\] Sister in Buddha, Chārudatta is being
led to his death for murdering you.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*In terror*.\] Alas! For my wretched sake the noble
Chārudatta put to death? Quick, quick! Oh, lead me thither!

*Monk*. Hasten, oh, hasten, sister in Buddha, to comfort the noble
Chārudatta while he yet lives. Make way, gentlemen, make way!

*Vasantasenā*. Make way, make way!

*Goha*. Noble Chārudatta, it is the king's commandment that bears the
blame. Think then of what you needs must think.

*Chārudatta*. Why waste words?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  Though slandered by a cruel fate,  
  And stained by men of high estate,  
If that my virtue yet regarded be,  
  Then she who dwells with gods above  
  Or wheresoever else—my love—  
By her sweet nature wipe the stain from me!<span
class="margnote">(34)</span>

</div>

*Goha*. \[*Drawing his sword*.\] Noble Chārudatta, lie flat and be
quiet. With one stroke we will kill you and send you to heaven.
\[*Chārudatta does so. Goha raises his arm to strike. The sword falls
from his hand*.\] What is this?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I fiercely grasped within my hand  
My thunderbolt-appalling brand;  
Why did it fall upon the sand? 36

</div>

But since it did, I conclude that the noble Chārudatta is not to die.
Have mercy, O mighty goddess of the Sahya hills! If only Chārudatta
might be saved, then hadst thou shown favor to our headsman caste.

*Ahīnta*. Let us do as we were ordered.

*Goha*. Well, let us do it. \[*They make ready to impale Chārudatta*.\]

*Goha*. \[*Perceiving her*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Who is the woman with the streaming hair

*Vasantasenā*. Oh, Chārudatta! What does it mean? \[*She falls on his
breast*.\]

*Monk*. Oh, Chārudatta! What does it mean? \[*He falls at his feet*.\]

*Goha*. \[*Anxiously withdrawing*.\] Vasantasenā?—At least, we did not
kill an innocent man.

*Monk*. \[*Rising*.\] Thank heaven! Chārudatta lives.

*Goha*. And shall live a hundred years!

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Joyfully*.\] And I too am brought back to life again.

*Goha*. The king is at the place of sacrifice. Let us report to him what
has taken place. \[*The two headsmen start to go away*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Perceives Vasantasenā. In terror*.\] Goodnessh! who
brought the shlave back to life? Thish is the end of me. Good! I'll run
away. \[*He runs away*.\]

*Goha*. \[*Returning*.\] Well, didn't we have orders from the king to
put the man to death who murdered Vasantasenā? Let us hunt for the
king's brother-in-law.

\[*Exeunt the two headsmen*.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

*Chārudatta*. \[*In amazement*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Who saves me from the uplifted weapon's scorn,

A streaming cloud above the rainless corn?<span

\[*He gazes at her*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Is this Vasantasenā's counterfeit?  
Or she herself, from heaven above descended?

Or has her precious life not yet been ended?<span

</div>

Or again:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Did she return from heaven,

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Rises tearfully and falls at his feet*.\] O noble
Chārudatta, I am indeed the wretch for whose sake you are fallen upon
this unworthy plight.

*Voices behind the scenes*. A miracle, a miracle! Vasantasenā lives.
\[*The bystanders repeat the words*.\]

*Chārudatta*. \[*Listens, then rises suddenly, embraces Vasantasenā, and
closes his eyes. In a voice trembling with emotion*.\] My love! You are
Vasantasenā!

*Vasantasenā*. That same unhappy woman.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Gazes upon her. Joyfully*.\] Can it be? Vasantasenā
herself? \[*In utter happiness*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Her bosom bathed in streaming tears,

Vasantasenā! Oh, my belovèd!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Unto my body, whence the life was fleeting,

</div>

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

But see, my belovèd!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

My blood-red garment seems a bridegroom's cloak,  
Death's garland seems to me a bridal wreath;

          For she is here.<span class="margnote">43</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. You with your utter kindliness, what can it be that you
have done?

*Chārudatta*. My belovèd, he said that I had killed you.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For ancient hatred's sake, my mighty foe,  
Hell's victim now, had almost laid me low.<span

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Stopping her ears*.\] Heaven avert the omen! It was
he, the king's brother-in-law, who killed me.

*Chārudatta*. \[*Perceiving the monk*.\] But who is this?

*Vasantasenā*. When that unworthy wretch had killed me, this worthy man
brought me back to life.

*Chārudatta*. Who are you, unselfish friend?

*Monk*. You do not remember me, sir. I am that shampooer, who once was
happy to rub your feet. When I fell into the hands of certain gamblers,
this sister in Buddha, upon hearing that I had been your servant, bought
my freedom with her jewels. Thereupon I grew tired of the gambler's
life, and became a Buddhist monk. Now this lady made a mistake in her
bullock-cart, and so came to the old garden Pushpakaranda. But when that
unworthy wretch learned that she would not love him, he murdered her by
strangling. And I found her there.

*Loud voices behind the scenes*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Unending victory to Shiva be,  
  Who Daksha's offering foiled;  
And victory may Kārttikeya see,  
  Who Krauncha smote and spoiled; <span id="page_171">p. 171</span>  
And victory to Aryaka the king  
  His mighty foe he kills  
Far over all the earth's expansive ring,  
That earth her joyous flag abroad may fling,  
  The snowy banner of Kailāsa's hills.<span class="margnote">45</span>

</div>

\[*Enter hurriedly Sharvilaka*.\]

*Sharv*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Yes, Pālaka, the royal wretch, I slew,  
Anointing Aryaka good king and true;  
  And now, like sacrificial flowers, I wed  
  The king's commandment to my bended head,  
To give sad Chārudatta life anew.<span class="margnote">46</span>

The foe whose powers and friends had fled, he slew,  
Consoled and comforted his subjects true;  
  And earth's broad sovereignty has gladly wed  
  His power, and bent to him her lowly head,  
Who toward his foe plays Indra's part anew.<span

</div>

\[*He looks before him*.\] Ah! There he will be found, where the people
are thus gathered together. Oh, that this deed of King Aryaka might be
crowned with the rescued life of noble Chārudatta! \[He quickens his
steps.\] Make way, you rascals! \[*He discovers Chārudatta. Joyfully*.\]
Is Chārudatta yet living, and Vasantasenā? Truly, our sovereign's wishes
are fulfilled.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Now, thanks to heaven, from sorrow's shoreless sea  
I see him saved by her he loved, set free  
By that sweet bark, that knew her course to steer  
With virtue's tackle and with goodness' gear.  
He seems the moon, whose light shines clear at last,  
When all the sad eclipse is overpast.<span class="margnote">48</span>

</div>

Yet how shall I approach him, who have so grievously sinned against him?
But no! Honesty is always honorable. \[*He approaches and, folds his
hands. Aloud*.\] O noble Chārudatta!

*Chārudatta*. Who are you, sir?

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

*Sharvilaka*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I forced your house in manner base,

I throw myself upon your grace.<span class="margnote">49</span>

*Chārudatta*. Not so, my friend. Thereby you showed your faith in me.
\[*He embraces him*.\]

*Sharvilaka*. And one thing more:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The very noble Aryaka,  
  To save his family and name,

*Chārudatta*. What say you?

*Sharvilaka*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

’Twas your cart helped him on his way,  
  Who sought the shelter of your name;  
He slew King Pālaka to-day,  
  A victim at the altar's flame.<span class="margnote">51</span>

</div>

*Chārudatta*. Sharvilaka, did you set free that Aryaka, whom Pālaka took
from his hamlet, and confined without cause in the tower?

*Sharvilaka*. I did.

*Chārudatta*. This is indeed most welcome tidings.

*Sharvilaka*. Scarcely was your friend Aryaka established in Ujjayinī,
when he bestowed upon you the throne of Kushāvatī, on the bank of the
Venā. May you graciously receive this first token of his love. \[*He
turns around*.\] Come, lead hither that rascal, that villain, the
brother-in-law of the king!

*Voices behind the scenes*. We will, Sharvilaka.

*Sharvilaka*. Sir, King Aryaka declares that he won this kingdom through
your virtues, and that you are therefore to have some benefit from it.

*Chārudatta*. The kingdom won through my virtues?

 

*Voices behind the scenes*. Come on, brother-in-law of the king, and

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

reap the reward of your insolence. \[*Enter Sansthānaka, guarded, with
his hands tied behind his back*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. Goodnessh gracious!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It came to pass, I ran away  
Like any ass, and had my day.

\[*He looks about him*.\] They crowd around me, though I'm a relative of
the king's. To whom shall I go for help in my helplesshnessh? \[*He
reflects*.\] Good! I'll go to the man who gives help and shows mercy to

protect me! \[*He falls at his feet*.\]

*Voices behind the scenes*. Noble Chārudatta, leave him to us! let us

be safe.

Chārudatta! \[*To Chārudatta*.\] Tell me. What shall be done with the
wretch?

protect me! Do shomething worthy of yourshelf. I'll never do it again!

*Voices of citizens behind the scenes*. Kill him! Why should the wretch
be allowed to live?

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

\[*Vasantasenā takes the garland of death from Chārudatta's neck, and
throws it upon Sansthānaka*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. You shlave-wench, be merciful, be merciful! I'll never
murder you again. Protect me!

*Sharvilaka*. Come, take him away! Noble Chārudatta, say what shall be
done with the wretch.

*Chārudatta*. Will you do as I say?

*Sharvilaka*. How can you doubt it?

*Chārudatta*. Really?

*Sharvilaka*. Really.

*Chārudatta*. Then let him be immediately—

*Sharvilaka*. Killed?

*Chārudatta*. No, no! Set free.

*Sharvilaka*. What for?

*Chārud*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The humbled foe who seeks thine aid,

*Chārudatta*. Monk, what do you most desire?

*Monk*. When I see this example of the uncertainty of all things,

I am twice content to be a monk.

*Chārudatta*. His purpose is not to be changed, my friend. Let him be
appointed spiritual father over all the monasteries in the land.

*Sharvilaka*. It shall be done.

*Monk*. It is all that I desire.

*Vasantasenā*. Now I am indeed brought back to life.

*Sharvilaka*. What shall be done for Sthāvaraka?

*Chārudatta*. Let the good fellow be given his freedom. Let those
headsmen be appointed chiefs of all the headsmen. Let Chandanaka be
appointed chief of all the police in the land. Let the brother-in-law of
the king continue to act exactly as he acted in the past.

*Sharvilaka*. It shall be done. Only that man—leave him to me, and I'll
kill him.
