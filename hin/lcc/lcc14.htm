<p><i>Monk</i>. [<i>Discovers the speaker. Fearfully</i>.] Heaven help me! Here is the king's brother-in-law, Sansth&#257;naka. Just because one monk committed an offense, now, wherever he sees a monk, whether it is the same one or not, he bores a hole in his nose and drives him around like a bullock.

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. Alas! That is not Vardham&#257;naka's voice. What does it mean? I wonder if Ch&#257;rudatta was afraid that the bullocks might become weary, and so sent another man with another cart. My right eye twitches. My heart is all a-tremble. There is no one in sight.

<p><i>Sth&#257;varaka</i>. By which road?</p>  
<p><i>Sansth&#257;naka</i>. Right here, where the wall is tumbling down.</p>  
<p><i>Sth&#257;varaka</i>. Oh, master, the bullocks will be killed. The cart will go to pieces. And I, your servant, shall be killed.</p>  
<p><i>Sansth&#257;naka</i>. I'm the king's brother-in-law, man. If the bullocks are killed, I'll buy shome more. If the cart goes to pieces, I'll have another one made. If you are killed, there will be another driver.</p>

<p><i>Courtier</i>. Don't be frightened. How could a witch travel in a bullock-cart? I hope that the heat of the midday sun has not blinded you, so that you became the victim of an hallucination when you saw the shadow of Sth&#257;varaka with the smock on it.</p>  
<p><i>Sansth&#257;naka</i>. Sth&#257;varaka, my little shon, my shlave, are you alive?</p>

<p><i>Sansth&#257;naka</i>. Firsht you murder Vasantasen&#257; in my old garden Pushpakaranda, and now where will you run to? Come, defend yourshelf in court before my shishter's husband! [<i>He holds him back</i>.]</p>  
<p><i>Courtier</i>. Enough, you accurs&egrave;d scoundrel! [<i>He draws his sword</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Sth&#257;varaka</i>. Master, you have committed a terrible crime.</p>  
<p><i>Sansth&#257;naka</i>. Shlave! What do you mean by talking about a crime? Well, I'll do it thish way. [<i>He takes various ornaments from his person</i>.] Take these gems. I give &#146;em to you. Whenever I want to wear them, I'll take them back again, but the resht of the time they are yours.</p>  
<p><i>Sth&#257;varaka</i>. They should be worn only by my master. What have I to do with such things?</p>  
<p><i>Sansth&#257;naka</i>. Go along! Take these bullocks, and wait in the tower of my palace until I come.</p>

<p><i>Sansth&#257;naka</i>. The gentleman has made himshelf invisible. He wanted to save himshelf. And the shlave I'll put in irons in the palace tower, and keep him there. And sho the shecret will be shafe. I'll go along, but firsht I'll take a look at her. Is she dead, or shall I murder her again? [<i>He looks at Vasantasen&#257;</i>.] Dead as a door-nail! Good! I'll cover her with thish cloak. No, it has my name on it. Shome honesht man might recognize it. Well, here are shome dry leaves that the wind has blown into a heap. I'll cover her with them. [<i>He does so, then pauses to reflect</i>.] Good! I'll do it thish way. I'll go to court at once, and there I'll lodge a complaint.

<p><i>Vasantasen&#257;</i>. I seem to remember, but not just as you say. It were better that I had slept never to waken.</p>
