### A LIST OF PASSAGES

#### IN WHICH THE TRANSLATION DEPARTS FROM PARAB'S TEXT

85.15: Here *nirmitāḥ* is apparently a mere misprint for *nirjitāḥ*.

45.11: The addition of *uṭṭhedha tti* seems almost necessary.

53.10; 54.9; 55.11; 62.7; 66.7: In these passages I have substituted
"shampooer" for "gambler," to prevent confusion of the shampooer with
the unnamed gambler.

57.18: I have added the stage-direction *dyūtakaramaṇḍatm kṛtvā*.

67.5: Read *kaṁ* for *kiṁ*.

72.9: Read *ajjo bandhuaṇaṁ samassāsiduṁ* for Parab's *ajja bandhuaṇo
samassasadu*.

78.5: We should probably read *bīhacchaṁ* (*bībhatsam*) for *vīhatthaṁ*.

87.8: The words *cikitsāṁ kṛtvā* seem to be part of the text, not of the
stage-direction.

97.18: I regard *nayasya* as one word, not two (*na yasya*).

100.12: Read *rakṣān* for *rakṣyān*.

114.5: Read *ṇaaraṇārī*- for *ṇaraṇārī*-.

125.8-11: These lines I have omitted.

126.4: Read *accharīa*- (*āçcarya*-) for *accharīdi*-.

170.8: Read *eka*- for *ekā*-.

178.11: Read *vaḍḍhamāṇao* for *vaḍḍhamāṇaa*.

184.9: Read *a* (*ca*) for *ka*.

217.15: Whatever *çavoḍiaṁ* may be, I have translated it in accordance
with Lallādīkṣita's gloss, *saveṣṭikam*.

226.2: Apparently *khala*- is a misprint for *khaṅa*-.

238.10: Read -*ruciram* for -*racitam*.

259.16: Read *udvīkṣya* for *udvījya*.

262.4: Read -*bhājanam* for -*bhojanam*.

262.14: Read *paḍicchidaṁ* (*pratīṣṭam*) for *paḍicchiduṁ*.

265.6: Read *tvayā* for *mayā*.

284.14: The words *atha vā* plainly belong to the text, not to the
stage-direction.

287.2: I take *paurāḥ* as part of the stage-direction.

288.8-292.9: This passage I have omitted: compare page
[xii](lcc03.htm#page_xii.md).
