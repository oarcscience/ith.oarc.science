### INTRODUCTION

#### I. THE AUTHOR AND THE PLAY

CONCERNING the life, the date, and the very identity <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) of King Shūdraka, the reputed author of The
Little Clay Cart, we are curiously ignorant. No other work is ascribed
to him, and we have no direct information about him, beyond the somewhat
fanciful statements of the Prologue to this play. There are, to be sure,
many tales which cluster about the name of King Shūdraka, but none of
them represents him as an author. Yet our very lack of information may
prove, to some extent at least, a disguised blessing. For our ignorance
of external fact compels a closer study of the text, if we would find
out what manner of man it was who wrote the play. And the case of King
Shūdraka is by no means unique in India; in regard to every great
Sanskrit writer,—so bare is Sanskrit literature of biography,—we are
forced to concentrate attention on the man as he reveals himself in his
works. First, however, it may be worth while to compare Shūdraka with
two other great dramatists of India, and thus to discover, if we may, in
what ways he excels them or is excelled by them.

Kālidāsa, Shūdraka, Bhavabhūti—assuredly, these are the greatest names
in the history of the Indian drama. So different are these men, and so
great, that it is not possible to assert for any one of them such
supremacy as Shakspere holds in the English drama. It is true that
Kālidāsa's dramatic masterpiece, the Shakuntalā, is the most widely
known of the Indian plays. It is true that the tender and elegant
Kālidāsa has been called, with a not wholly fortunate

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

enthusiasm, the "Shakspere of India." But this rather exclusive
admiration of the Shakuntalā results from lack of information about the
other great Indian dramas. Indeed, it is partly due to the accident that
only the Shakuntalā became known in translation at a time when romantic
Europe was in full sympathy with the literature of India.

Bhavabhūti, too, is far less widely known than Kālidāsa; and for this
the reason is deeper-seated. The austerity of Bhavabhūti's style, his
lack of humor, his insistent grandeur, are qualities which prevent his
being a truly popular poet. With reference to Kālidāsa, he holds a
position such as Aeschylus holds with reference to Euripides. He will
always seem to minds that sympathize with his grandeur <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) the greatest of Indian poets; while by other
equally discerning minds of another order he will be admired, but not
passionately loved.

Yet however great the difference between Kālidāsa, "the grace of
poetry," <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md) and Bhavabhūti, "the master
of eloquence," <span id="fr_4"></span>[3](#fn_4.md) these two authors are
far more intimately allied in spirit than is either of them with the
author of The Little Clay Cart. Kālidāsa and Bhavabhūti are Hindus of
the Hindus; the Shakuntalā and the Latter Acts of Rāma could have been
written nowhere save in India: but Shūdraka, alone in the long line of
Indian dramatists, has a cosmopolitan character. Shakuntalā is a Hindu
maid, Mādhava is a Hindu hero; but Sansthānaka and Maitreya and Madanikā
are citizens of the world. In some of the more striking characteristics
of Sanskrit literature—in its fondness for system, its elaboration of
style, its love of epigram—Kālidāsa and Bhavabhūti are far truer

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

to their native land than is Shūdraka. In Shūdraka we find few of those
splendid phrases in which, as the Chinese <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) say, it is only the words which stop, the
sense goes on,"—phrases like Kālidāsa's <span
id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) "there are doors of the inevitable
everywhere," or Bhavabhūti's <span id="fr_7"></span>[3](#fn_7.md) "for
causeless love there is no remedy." As regards the predominance of
swift-moving action over the poetical expression of great truths, The
Little Clay Cart stands related to the Latter Acts of Rāma as Macbeth
does to Hamlet. Again, Shūdraka's style is simple and direct, a rare
quality in a Hindu; and although this style, in the passages of higher
emotion, is of an exquisite simplicity, yet Shūdraka cannot infuse into
mere language the charm which we find in Kalīdāsa or the majesty which
we find in Bhavabhūti.

Yet Shūdraka's limitations in regard to stylistic power are not without
their compensation. For love of style slowly strangled originality and
enterprise in Indian poets, and ultimately proved the death of Sanskrit
literature. Now just at this point, where other Hindu writers are weak,
Shūdraka stands forth preëminent. Nowhere else in the hundreds of
Sanskrit dramas do we find such variety, and such drawing of character,
as in The Little Clay Cart; and nowhere else, in the drama at least, is
there such humor. Let us consider, a little more in detail, these three
characteristics of our author; his variety, his skill in the drawing of
character, his humor.

To gain a rough idea of Shūdraka's variety, we have only to recall the
names of the acts of the play. Here The Shampooer who Gambled and The
Hole in the Wall are shortly followed by The Storm; and The Swapping of
the Bullock-carts is closely succeeded by The Strangling of Vasantasenā.
From farce to tragedy, from

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

satire to pathos, runs the story, with a breadth truly Shaksperian. Here
we have philosophy:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*The lack of money is the root of all evil*. (*i. 14*)

</div>

</div>

And pathos:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*My body wet by tear-drops falling, falling;  
  My limbs polluted by the clinging mud;  
Flowers from the graveyard torn, my wreath appalling;  
For ghastly sacrifice hoarse ravens calling,  
  And for the fragrant incense of my blood*. (*x. 3*)

</div>

And nature description:

  *But mistress, do not scold the lightning. She is your friend*,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*This golden cord that trembles on the breast  
Of great Airāvata; upon the crest  
Of rocky hills this banner all ablaze;  
This lamp in Indra's palace; but most blest  
As telling where your most belovèd stays*. (v. 33)

</div>

And genuine bitterness:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*Pride and tricks and lies and fraud  
  Are in your face;  
False playground of the lustful god,  
  Such is your face;  
The wench's stock in trade, in fine,  
Epitome of joys divine,  
  I mean your face  
For sale! the price is courtesy.  
I trust you'll find a man to buy  
    Your face*. (*v. 36*)

</div>

It is natural that Shūdraka should choose for the expression of matters
so diverse that type of drama which gives the greatest scope to the
author's creative power. This type is the so-called

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

"drama of invention," <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) a category
curiously subordinated in India to the heroic drama, the plot of which
is drawn from history or mythology. Indeed, The Little Clay Cart is the
only extant drama which fulfils the spirit of the drama of invention, as
defined by the Sanskrit canons of dramaturgy. The plot of the "Mālatī
and Mādhava," or of the "Mallikā and Māruta," is in no true sense the
invention of the author; and The Little Clay Cart is the only drama of
invention which is "full of rascals." <span id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md)

But a spirit so powerful as that of King Shūdraka could not be confined
within the strait jacket of the minute, and sometimes puerile, rules of
the technical works. In the very title of the drama, he has disregarded
the rule <span id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_10.md) that the name of a drama of
invention should be formed by compounding the names of heroine and
hero. <span id="fr_11"></span>[4](#fn_11.md) Again, the books
prescribe <span id="fr_12"></span>[5](#fn_12.md) that the hero shall appear
in every act; yet Chārudatta does not appear in acts ii., iv., vi., and
viii. And further, various characters, Vasantasenā, Maitreya, the
courtier, and others, have vastly gained because they do not conform too
closely to the technical definitions.

The characters of The Little Clay Cart are living men and women. Even
when the type makes no strong appeal to Western minds, as in the case of
Chārudatta, the character lives, in a sense in which Dushyanta <span
id="fr_13"></span>[6](#fn_13.md) or even Rāma <span
id="fr_14"></span>[7](#fn_14.md) can hardly be said to live. Shūdraka's men
are better individualized than his women; this fact alone differentiates
him sharply from other Indian dramatists. He draws on every class of
society, from the high-souled Brahman to the executioner and the
housemaid.

His greatest character is unquestionably Sansthānaka, this combination

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

of ignorant conceit, brutal lust, and cunning, this greater than Cloten,
who, after strangling an innocent woman, can say: <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) "Oh, come! Let's go and play in the pond."
Most attractive characters are the five <span
id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md) conspirators, men whose home is "east of
Suez and the ten commandments." They live from hand to mouth, ready at
any moment to steal a gem-casket or to take part in a revolution, and
preserving through it all their character as gentlemen and their
irresistible conceit. And side by side with them moves the hero
Chārudatta, the Buddhist beau-ideal of manhood,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*A tree of life to them whose sorrows grow,  
Beneath its fruit of virtue bending low*. (*i. 48*)

</div>

To him, life itself is not dear, but only honor. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[3](#fn_17.md) He values wealth only as it supplies him
with the means of serving others. We may, with some justice, compare him
with Antonio in The Merchant of Venice. There is some inconsistency,
from our point of view, in making such a character the hero of a
love-drama; and indeed, it is Vasantasenā who does most of the
love-making. <span id="fr_18"></span>[4](#fn_18.md)

Vasantasenā is a character with neither the girlish charm of
Shakuntalā <span id="fr_19"></span>[5](#fn_19.md) nor the mature womanly
dignity of Sītā. <span id="fr_20"></span>[6](#fn_20.md) She is more
admirable than lovable. Witty and wise she is, and in her love as true
as steel; this too, in a social position which makes such constancy
difficult. Yet she cannot be called a great character; she does not seem
so true to life as her clever maid, Madanikā. In making the heroine of
his play a courtezan, Shūdraka follows a suggestion of the technical
works on the drama; he does not thereby cast any imputation of ill on
Vasantasenā's character. The courtezan class in India corresponded
roughly to the hetæræ of

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

ancient Greece or the geishas of Japan; it was possible to be a
courtezan and retain one's self-respect. Yet the inherited <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) way of life proves distasteful to
Vasantasenā; her one desire is to escape its limitations and its dangers
by becoming a legal wife. <span id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md)

In Maitreya, the Vidūshaka, we find an instance of our author's masterly
skill in giving life to the dry bones of a rhetorical definition. The
Vidūshaka is a stock character who has something in common with a
jester; and in Maitreya the essential traits of the character—eagerness
for good food and other creature comforts, and blundering devotion to
his friend—are retained, to be sure, but clarified and elevated by his
quaint humor and his readiness to follow Chārudatta even in death. The
grosser traits of the typical Vidūshaka are lacking. Maitreya is neither
a glutton nor a fool, but a simple-minded, whole-hearted friend.

The courtier is another character suggested by the technical works, and
transformed by the genius of Shūdraka. He is a man not only of education
and social refinement, but also of real nobility of nature. But he is in
a false position from the first, this true gentleman at the wretched
court of King Pālaka; at last he finds the courage to break away, and
risks life, and all that makes life attractive, by backing Aryaka. Of
all the conspirators, it is he who runs the greatest risk. To his
protection of Vasantasenā is added a touch of infinite pathos when we
remember that he was himself in love with her. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[3](#fn_23.md) Only when Vasantasenā leaves him <span
id="fr_24"></span>[4](#fn_24.md) without a thought, to enter Chārudatta's
house, does he realize how much he loves her; then, indeed, he breaks
forth in words of the most passionate jealousy. We need not linger over
the other characters, except to observe that each has his marked
individuality,

<span id="page_xxii">p. xxii</span>

and that each helps to make vivid this picture of a society that seems
at first so remote.

Shūdraka's humor is the third of his vitally distinguishing qualities.
This humor has an American flavor, both in its puns and in its
situations. The plays on words can seldom be adequately reproduced in
translation, but the situations are independent of language. And
Shūdraka's humor runs the whole gamut, from grim to farcical, from
satirical to quaint. Its variety and keenness are such that King
Shūdraka need not fear a comparison with the greatest of Occidental
writers of comedies.

It remains to say a word about the construction of the play. Obviously,
it is too long. More than this, the main action halts through acts ii.
to v., and during these episodic acts we almost forget that the main
plot concerns the love of Vasantasenā and Chārudatta. Indeed, we have in
The Little Clay Cart the material for two plays. The larger part of act
i. forms with acts vi. to x. a consistent and ingenious plot; while the
remainder of act i. might be combined with acts iii. to v. to make a
pleasing comedy of lighter tone. The second act, clever as it is, has
little real connection either with the main plot or with the story of
the gems. The breadth of treatment which is observable in this play is
found in many other specimens of the Sanskrit drama, which has set
itself an ideal different from that of our own drama. The lack of
dramatic unity and consistency is often compensated, indeed, by lyrical
beauty and charms of style; but it suggests the question whether we
might not more justly speak of the Sanskrit plays as dramatic poems than
as dramas. In The Little Clay Cart, at any rate, we could ill afford to
spare a single scene, even though the very richness and variety of the
play remove it from the class of the world's greatest dramas.

<span id="page_xxiii">p. xxiii</span>

#### II. THE TRANSLATION

THE following translation is sufficiently different from previous
translations of Indian plays to require a word of explanation. The
difference consists chiefly in the manner in which I have endeavored to
preserve the form of the original. The Indian plays are written in
mingled prose and verse; and the verse portion forms so large a part of
the whole that the manner in which it is rendered is of much importance.
Now this verse is not analogous to the iambic trimeter of Sophocles or
the blank verse of Shakspere, but roughly corresponds to the Greek
choruses or the occasional rhymed songs of the Elizabethan stage. In
other words, the verse portion of a Sanskrit drama is not narrative; it
is sometimes descriptive, but more commonly lyrical: each stanza sums up
the emotional impression which the preceding action or dialogue has made
upon one of the actors. Such matter is in English cast into the form of
the rhymed stanza; and so, although rhymed verse is very rarely employed
in classical Sanskrit, it seems the most appropriate vehicle for the
translation of the stanzas of a Sanskrit drama. It is true that we
occasionally find stanzas which might fitly be rendered in English blank
verse, and, more frequently, stanzas which are so prosaic as not to
deserve a rendering in English verse at all. <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) But, as the present translation may be
regarded as in some sort an experiment, I have preferred to hold rigidly
to the distinction found in the original between simple prose and types
of stanza which seem to me to correspond to English rhymed verse.

It is obvious that a translation into verse, and especially into rhymed
verse, cannot be as literal as a translation into prose; this

<span id="page_xxiv">p. xxiv</span>

disadvantage I have used my best pains to minimize. I hope it may be
said that nothing of real moment has been omitted from the verses; and
where lack of metrical skill has compelled expansion, I have striven to
make the additions as insignificant as possible.

There is another point, however, in which it is hardly feasible to
imitate the original; this is the difference in the dialects used by the
various characters. In The Little Clay Cart, as in other Indian dramas,
some of the characters speak Sanskrit, others Prākrit. Now Prākrit is
the generic name for a number of dialects derived from the Sanskrit and
closely akin to it. The inferior personages of an Indian play, and, with
rare exceptions, all the women, speak one or another of these Prākrits.
Of the thirty characters of this play, for example, only five
(Chārudatta, the courtier, Aryaka, Sharvilaka, and the judge) speak
Sanskrit; <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) the others speak various
Prākrit dialects. Only in the case of Sansthānaka have I made a rude
attempt to suggest the dialect by substituting *sh* for *s* as he does.
And the grandiloquence of Sharvilaka's Sanskrit in the satirical portion
of the third act I have endeavored to imitate.

Whenever the language of the original is at all technical, the
translator labors under peculiar difficulty. Thus the legal terms found
in the ninth act are inadequately rendered, and, to some extent at
least, inevitably so; for the legal forms, or lack of forms, pictured
there were never contemplated by the makers of the English legal
vocabulary. It may be added here that in rendering from a literature so
artificial as the Sanskrit, one must lose not only the sensuous beauty
of the verse, but also many plays on words.

In regard to the not infrequent repetitions found in the text, I

<span id="page_xxv">p. xxv</span>

have used my best judgment. Such repetitions have been given in full
where it seemed to me that the force or unity of the passage gained by
such treatment, or where the original repeats in full, as in the case of
v. 7, which is identical with iii. 29. Elsewhere, I have merely
indicated the repetition after the manner of the original.

The reader will notice that there was little effort to attain realism in
the presentation of an Indian play. He need not be surprised therefore
to find (page [145](lcc15.htm#page_145).md) that Vīraka leaves the
courtroom, mounts a horse, rides to the suburbs, makes an investigation
and returns—all within the limits of a stage-direction. The simplicity
of presentation also makes possible sudden shifts of scene. In the first
act, for example, there are six scenes, which take place alternately in
Chārudatta's house and in the street outside. In those cases where a
character enters "seated" or "asleep," I have substituted the verb
"appear" for the verb "enter"; yet I am not sure that this concession to
realism is wise.

The system of transliteration which I have adopted is intended to render
the pronunciation of proper names as simple as may be to the English
reader. The consonants are to be pronounced as in English, <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) the vowels as in Italian. Diacritical
marks have been avoided, with the exception of the macron. This sign has
been used consistently <span id="fr_28"></span>[2](#fn_28.md) to mark long
vowels except e and o, which are always long. Three rules suffice for
the placing of the accent. A long penult is accented: Maitréya,
Chārudátta. If the penult is short, the antepenult is accented provided
it be long: Sansthá̄naka. If both penult and antepenult of a
four-syllabled word are short, the pre-antepenultimate receives the
accent: Mádanikā, Sthá̄,varaka.

<span id="page_xxvi">p. xxvi</span>

#### III. AN OUTLINE OF THE PLOT

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> I., entitled *The Gems are left
Behind*. Evening of the first day.—After the prologue, Chārudatta, who
is within his house, converses with his friend Maitreya, and deplores
his poverty. While they are speaking, Vasantasenā appears in the street
outside. She is pursued by the courtier and Sansthānaka; the latter
makes her degrading offers of his love, which she indignantly rejects.
Chārudatta sends Maitreya from the house to offer sacrifice, and through
the open door Vasantasenā slips unobserved into the house. Maitreya
returns after an altercation with Sansthānaka, and recognizes
Vasantasenā. Vasantasenā leaves a casket of gems in the house for safe
keeping and returns to her home.

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> II., entitled *The Shampooer who
Gambled*. Second day.—The act opens in Vasantasenā's house. Vasantasenā
confesses to her maid Madanikā her love for Chārudatta. Then a shampooer
appears in the street, pursued by the gambling-master and a gambler, who
demand of him ten gold-pieces which he has lost in the gambling-house.
At this point Darduraka enters, and engages the gambling-master and the
gambler in an angry discussion, during which the shampooer escapes into
Vasantasenā's house. When Vasantasenā learns that the shampooer had once
served Chārudatta, she pays his debt; the grateful shampooer resolves to
turn monk. As he leaves the house he is attacked by a runaway elephant,
and saved by Karnapūraka, a servant of Vasantasenā.

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> III., entitled *The Hole in the
Wall*. The night following the second day.—Chārudatta and Maitreya
return home after midnight from a concert, and go to sleep. Maitreya has
in his hand the gem-casket which Vasantasenā has left behind. Sharvilaka
enters. He is in love with Madanikā, a maid of Vasantasenā's, and is
resolved

<span id="page_xxvii">p. xxvii</span>

to acquire by theft the means of buying her freedom. He makes a hole in
the wall of the house, enters, and steals the casket of gems which
Vasantasenā had left. Chārudatta wakes to find casket and thief gone.
His wife gives him her pearl necklace with which to make restitution.

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> IV., entitled *Madanikā and
Sharvilaka*. Third day.—Sharvilaka comes to Vasantasenā's house to buy
Madanikā's freedom. Vasantasenā overhears the facts concerning the theft
of her gem-casket from Chārudatta's house, but accepts the casket, and
gives Madanikā her freedom. As Sharvilaka leaves the house, he hears
that his friend Aryaka, who had been imprisoned by the king, has escaped
and is being pursued. Sharvilaka departs to help him. Maitreya comes
from Chārudatta with the pearl necklace, to repay Vasantasenā for the
gem-casket. She accepts the necklace also, as giving her an excuse for a
visit to Chārudatta.

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> V., entitled *The Storm*. Evening of
the third day.—Chārudatta appears in the garden of his house. Here he
receives a servant of Vasantasenā, who announces that Vasantasenā is on
her way to visit him. Vasantasenā then appears in the street with the
courtier; the two describe alternately the violence and beauty of the
storm which has suddenly arisen. Vasantasenā dismisses the courtier,
enters the garden, and explains to Chārudatta how she has again come
into possession of the gem-casket. Meanwhile, the storm has so increased
in violence that she is compelled to spend the night at Chārudatta's
house.

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> VI., entitled *The Swapping of the
Bullock-carts*. Morning of the fourth day.—Here she meets Chārudatta's
little son, Rohasena. The boy is peevish because he can now have only a
little clay cart to play with, instead of finer toys. Vasantasenā gives
him her gems to buy a toy cart of gold. Chārudatta's servant drives up
to

<span id="page_xxviii">p. xxviii</span>

take Vasantasenā in Chārudatta's bullock-cart to the park, where she is
to meet Chārudatta; but while Vasantasenā is making ready, he drives
away to get a cushion. Then Sansthānaka's servant drives up with his
master's cart, which Vasantasenā enters by mistake. Soon after,
Chārudatta's servant returns with his cart. Then the escaped prisoner
Aryaka appears and enters Chārudatta's cart. Two policemen come on the
scene; they are searching for Aryaka. One of them looks into the cart
and discovers Aryaka, but agrees to protect him. This he does by
deceiving and finally maltreating his companion.

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> VII., entitled *Aryaka's Escape*.
Fourth day.—Chārudatta is awaiting Vasantasenā in the park. His cart, in
which Aryaka lies hidden, appears. Chārudatta discovers the fugitive,
removes his fetters, lends him the cart, and leaves the park.

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> VIII., entitled *The Strangling of
Vasantasenā*. Fourth day.—A Buddhist monk, the shampooer of the second
act, enters the park. He has difficulty in escaping from Sansthānaka,
who appears with the courtier. Sansthānaka's servant drives in with the
cart which Vasantasenā had entered by mistake. She is discovered by
Sansthānaka, who pursues her with insulting offers of love. When she
repulses him, Sansthānaka gets rid of all witnesses, strangles her, and
leaves her for dead. The Buddhist monk enters again, revives
Vasantasenā, and conducts her to a monastery.

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> IX., entitled *The Trial*. Fifth
day.—Sansthānaka accuses Chārudatta of murdering Vasantasenā for her
money. In the course of the trial, it appears that Vasantasenā had spent
the night of the storm at Chārudatta's house; that she had left the
house the next morning to meet Chārudatta in the park; that there had
been a struggle in the park, which apparently ended in the murder of a
woman. Chārudatta's friend, Maitreya, enters with the gems which

<span id="page_xxix">p. xxix</span>

Vasantasenā had left to buy Chārudatta's son a toy cart of gold. These
gems fall to the floor during a scuffle between Maitreya and
Sansthānaka. In view of Chārudatta's poverty, this seems to establish
the motive for the crime, and Chārudatta is condemned to death.

<span class="smallcaps">Act</span> X., entitled *The End*. Sixth
day.—Two headsmen are conducting Chārudatta to the place of execution.
Chārudatta takes his last leave of his son and his friend Maitreya. But
Sansthānaka's servant escapes from confinement and betrays the truth;
yet he is not believed, owing to the cunning displayed by his master.
The headsmen are preparing to execute Chārudatta, when Vasantasenā
herself appears upon the scene, accompanied by the Buddhist monk. Her
appearance puts a summary end to the proceedings. Then news is brought
that Aryaka has killed and supplanted the former king, that he wishes to
reward Chārudatta, and that he has by royal edict freed Vasantasenā from
the necessity of living as a courtezan. Sansthānaka is brought before
Chārudatta for sentence, but is pardoned by the man whom he had so
grievously injured. The play ends with the usual Epilogue.
