### ACT THE EIGHTH

#### THE STRANGLING OF VASANTASENA

\[*Enter a monk, with a wet garment in his hand*.\]

*Monk*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Ye ignorant, lay by a store of virtue!  
Restrain the belly; watch eternally,  
  Heeding the beat of contemplation's <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) drum.  
For else the senses—fearful thieves they be  
  Will steal away all virtue's hoarded sum.<span
class="margnote">1</span>

</div>

And further: I have seen that all things are transitory, so that now I
am become the abode of virtues alone.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Who slays the Five Men, <span id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_72.md) and the
Female Bane, <span id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_73.md)  
  By whom protection to the Town <span id="fr_74"></span>[4](#fn_74.md) is
given,  
By whom the Outcaste <span id="fr_75"></span>[5](#fn_75.md) impotent is
slain,  
  He cannot fail to enter into heaven.<span class="margnote">2</span>  
Though head be shorn and face be shorn,  
  The heart unshorn, why should man shave him?  
But he whose inmost heart is shorn  
  Needs not the shaven head to save him.<span class="margnote">3</span>

</div>

I have dyed this robe of mine yellow. And now I will go into the garden
of the king's brother-in-law, wash it in the pond, and go away as soon
as I can. \[*He walks about and washes the robe*.\]

*A voice behind the scenes*. Shtop, you confounded monk, shtop!

*Monk*. \[*Discovers the speaker. Fearfully*.\] Heaven help me! Here is
the king's brother-in-law, Sansthānaka. Just because one monk committed
an offense, now, wherever he sees a monk, whether it is the same one or
not, he bores a hole in his nose and drives him around like a bullock.
Where shall a defenseless man find a defender? But after all, the
blessèd Lord Buddha is my defender.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

\[*Enter the courtier, carrying a sword, and Sansthānaka*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. Shtop, you confounded monk, shtop! I'll pound your head
like a red radish <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) at a drinking
party. \[*He strikes him*.\]

*Courtier*. You jackass, you should not strike a monk who wears the
yellow robes of renunciation. Why heed him? Look rather upon this
garden, which offers itself to pleasure.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

To creatures else forlorn, the forest trees  
Do works of mercy, granting joy and ease;  
Like a sinner's heart, the park unguarded lies,  
Like some new-founded realm, an easy prize.<span
class="margnote">4</span>

</div>

*Monk*. Heaven bless you! Be merciful, servant of the Blessèd One!

*Sansthānaka*. Did you hear that, shir? He's inshulting me.

*Courtier*. What does he say?

*Sansthānaka*. Shays I'm a shervant. What do you take me for? a barber?

*Courtier*. A servant of the Blessèd One he calls you, and this is
praise.

*Sansthānaka*. Praise me shome more, monk!

*Monk*. You are virtuous! You are a brick!

*Sansthānaka*. Shee? He shays I'm virtuous. He shays I'm a brick. What
do you think I am? a materialistic philosopher? or a watering-trough? or
a pot-maker? <span id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77.md)

*Courtier*. You jackass, he praises you when he says that you are
virtuous, that you are a brick.

*Sansthānaka*. Well, shir, what did he come here for?

*Monk*. To wash this robe.

*Sansthānaka*. Confound the monk! My shishter's husband gave me the
finesht garden there is, the garden Pushpakaranda. Dogs and jackals
drink the water in thish pond. Now I'm an arishtocrat, I'm

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

a man, and I don't even take a bath. And here you bring your shtinking
clothes, all shtained with shtale bean-porridge, and wash ’em! I think
one good shtroke will finish you.

*Courtier*. You jackass, I am sure he has not long been a monk.

*Sansthānaka*. How can you tell, shir?

*Courtier*. It doesn't take much to tell that. See!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

His hair is newly shorn; the brow still white;  
The rough cloak has not yet the shoulder scarred;  
He wears it awkwardly; it clings not tight;  
And here above, the fit is sadly marred.<span class="margnote">5</span>

</div>

*Monk*. True, servant of the Blessèd One. I have been a monk but a short
time.

*Sansthānaka*. Then why haven't you been one all your life? \[*He beats
him*.\]

*Monk*. Buddha be praised!

*Courtier*. Stop beating the poor fellow. Leave him alone. Let him go.

*Sansthānaka*. Jusht wait a minute, while I take counshel.

*Courtier*. With whom?

*Sansthānaka*. With my own heart.

*Courtier*. Poor fellow! Why didn't he escape?

*Sansthānaka*. Blesshèd little heart, my little shon and mashter, shall
the monk go, or shall the monk shtay? \[*To himself*.\] Neither go, nor
shtay. \[*Aloud*.\] Well, shir, I took counshel with my heart, and my
heart shays—

*Courtier*. Says what?

*Sansthānaka*. He shall neither go, nor shtay. He shall neither breathe
up, nor breathe down. He shall fall down right here and die, before you
can shay "boo."

*Monk*. Buddha be praised! I throw myself upon your protection.

*Courtier*. Let him go.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

*Sansthānaka*. Well, on one condition.

*Courtier*. And what is that?

*Sansthānaka*. He musht shling mud in, without making the water dirty.
Or better yet, he musht make the water into a ball, and shling it into
the mud.

*Courtier*. What incredible folly!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The patient earth is burdened by  
  So many a fool, so many a drone,  
Whose thoughts and deeds are all awry—  
  These trees of flesh, these forms of stone.<span
class="margnote">6</span>

</div>

\[*The monk makes faces at Sansthānaka*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. What does he mean?

*Courtier*. He praises you.

*Sansthānaka*. Praise me shome more! Praise me again! \[*The monk does
so, then exit*.\]

*Courtier*. See how beautiful the garden is, you jackass.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

See yonder trees, adorned with fruit and flowers,  
  O’er which the clinging creepers interlace;  
The watchmen guard them with the royal powers;  
  They seem like men whom loving wives embrace.<span
class="margnote">7</span>

</div>

*Sansthānaka*. A good deshcription, shir.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The ground is mottled with a lot of flowers;  
The blosshom freight bends down the lofty trees;  
And, hanging from the leafy tree-top bowers,  
The monkeys bob, like breadfruit in the breeze.<span
class="margnote">8</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. Will you be seated on this stone bench, you jackass?

*Sansthānaka*. I am sheated. \[*They seat themselves*.\] Do you know,
shir, I remember that Vasantasenā even yet. She is like an inshult. I
can't get her out of my mind.

*Courtier*. \[Aside.\] He remembers her even after such a repulse. For
indeed,

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The mean man, whom a woman spurns,  
        But loves the more;  
The wise man's passion gentler burns,  
        Or passes o’er.<span class="margnote">9</span>

</div>

*Sansthānaka*. Shome time has passhed, shir, shince I told my shervant
Sthāvaraka to take the bullock-cart and come as quick as he could. And
even yet he is not here. I've been hungry a long time, and at noon a man
can't go a-foot. For shee!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The shun is in the middle of the shky,  
  And hard to look at as an angry ape;  
Like Gāndhārī, whose hundred shons did die,  
  The earth is hard dishtresshed and can't eshcape.<span
class="margnote">10</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. True.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The cattle all—their cuds let fall—  
  Lie drowsing in the shade;  
In heated pool their lips to cool,  
  Deer throng the woodland glade;  
A prey to heat, the city street  
  Makes wanderers afraid;  
The cart must shun the midday sun,  
  And thus has been delayed.<span class="margnote">11</span>

</div>

*Sansthānaka*. Yesshir,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Fasht to my head the heated shun-beam clings;  
Birds, flying creatures, alsho wingèd things  
Resht in the branches of the trees, while men,  
People, and pershons shigh and shigh again;  
At home they tarry, in their houses shtay,  
To bear the heat and burden of the day.<span class="margnote">12</span>

</div>

Well, shir, that shervant isn't here yet. I'm going to shing shomething
to passh the time. \[*He sings*.\] There, shir, did you hear what I
shang?

*Courtier*. What shall I say? Ah, how melodious!

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

Sansthānaka. Why shouldn't it be malodorous?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Of nut-grass and cumin I make up a pickle,  
Of devil's-dung, ginger, and orris, and treacle;  
That's the mixture of perfumes I eagerly eat:  
Why shouldn't my voice be remarkably shweet?<span
class="margnote">13</span>

</div>

Well, shir, I'm jusht going to shing again. \[*He does so*.\] There,
shir, did you hear what I shang?

*Courtier*. What shall I say? Ah, how melodious!

*Sansthānaka*. Why shouldn't it be malodorous?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Of the flesh of the cuckoo I make up a chowder,  
With devil's-dung added, and black pepper powder;  
With oil and with butter I shprinkle the meat:  
Why shouldn't my voice be remarkably shweet?<span
class="margnote">14</span>

</div>

But shir, the shervant isn't here yet.

*Courtier*. Be easy in your mind. He will be here presently.

\[*Enter Vasantasenā in the bullock-cart, and Sthāvaraka*.\]

*Sthāvaraka*. I'm frightened. It is already noon. I hope Sansthānaka,
the king's brother-in-law, will not be angry. I must drive faster. Get
up, bullocks, get up!

*Vasantasenā*. Alas! That is not Vardhamānaka's voice. What does it
mean? I wonder if Chārudatta was afraid that the bullocks might become
weary, and so sent another man with another cart. My right eye twitches.
My heart is all a-tremble. There is no one in sight. Everything seems to
dance before my eyes.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Hearing the sound of wheels*.\] The cart is here,
shir.

*Courtier*. How do you know?

*Sansthānaka*. Can't you shee? It shqueaks like an old hog.

*Courtier*. \[*Perceives the cart*.\] Quite true. It is here.

*Sansthānaka*. Sthāvaraka, my little shon, my shlave, are you here?

*Sthāvaraka*. Yes, sir.

*Sansthānaka*. Is the cart here?

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

*Sthāvaraka*. Yes, sir.

*Sansthānaka*. Are the bullocks here?

*Sthāvaraka*. Yes, sir.

*Sansthānaka*. And are you here?

*Sthāvaraka*. \[*Laughing*.\] Yes, master, I am here too.

*Sansthānaka*. Then drive the cart in.

*Sthāvaraka*. By which road?

*Sansthānaka*. Right here, where the wall is tumbling down.

*Sthāvaraka*. Oh, master, the bullocks will be killed. The cart will go
to pieces. And I, your servant, shall be killed.

*Sansthānaka*. I'm the king's brother-in-law, man. If the bullocks are
killed, I'll buy shome more. If the cart goes to pieces, I'll have
another one made. If you are killed, there will be another driver.

*Sthāvaraka*. Everything will be replaced—except me.

*Sansthānaka*. Let the whole thing go to pieces. Drive in over the wall.

*Sthāvaraka*. Then break, cart, break with your driver. There will be
another cart. I must go and present myself to my master. \[*He drives
in*.\] What! not broken? Master, here is your cart.

*Sansthānaka*. The bullocks not shplit in two? and the ropes not killed?
and you too not killed?

*Sthāvaraka*. No, sir.

*Sansthānaka*. Come, shir. Let's look at the cart. You are my teacher,
shir, my very besht teacher. You are a man I reshpect, my intimate
friend, a man I delight to honor. Do you enter the cart firsht.

*Courtier*. Very well. \[*He starts to do so*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. Not much! Shtop! Is thish your father's cart, that you
should enter it firsht? I own thish cart. I'll enter it firsht.

*Courtier*. I only did what you said.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

*Sansthānaka*. Even if I do shay sho, you ought to be polite enough to
shay "After you, mashter."

*Courtier*. After you, then.

*Sansthānaka*. Now I'll enter. Sthāvaraka, my little shon, my shlave,
turn the cart around.

*Sthāvaraka*. \[*Does so*.\] Enter, master.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Enters and looks about, then hastily gets out in
terror, and falls on the courtier's neck*.\] Oh, oh, oh! You're a dead
man! There's a witch, or a thief, that's sitting and living in my
bullock-cart. If it's a witch, we'll both be robbed. If it's a thief,
we'll both be eaten alive.

*Courtier*. Don't be frightened. How could a witch travel in a
bullock-cart? I hope that the heat of the midday sun has not blinded
you, so that you became the victim of an hallucination when you saw the
shadow of Sthāvaraka with the smock on it.

*Sansthānaka*. Sthāvaraka, my little shon, my shlave, are you alive?

*Sthāvaraka*. Yes, sir.

*Sansthānaka*. But shir, there's a woman sitting and living in the
bullock-cart. Look and shee!

*Courtier*. A woman?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Then let us bow our heads at once and go,  
  Like steers whose eyes the falling raindrops daze;  
In public spots my dignity I show;  
  On high-born dames I hesitate to gaze.<span class="margnote">15</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. \[*In amazement. Aside*.\] Oh, oh! It is that thorn in my
eye, the king's brother-in-law. Alas! the danger is great. Poor woman!
My coming hither proves as fruitless as the sowing of a handful of seeds
on salty soil. What shall I do now?

*Sansthānaka*. Thish old shervant is afraid and he won't look into the
cart. Will you look into the cart, shir?

*Courtier*. I see no harm in that. Yes, I will do it.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

*Sansthānaka*. Are those things jackals that I shee flying into the air,
and are those things crows that walk on all fours? While the witch is
chewing him with her eyes, and looking at him with her teeth, I'll make
my eshcape.

*Courtier*. \[*Perceives Vasantasenā. Sadly to himself*.\] Is it
possible? The gazelle follows the tiger. Alas!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Her mate is lovely as the autumn moon,  
Who waits for her upon the sandy dune;  
And yet the swan will leave him? and will go  
To dance attendance on a common crow?<span class="margnote">16</span>

</div>

\[*Aside to Vasantasenā*.\] Ah, Vasantasenā! This is neither right, nor
worthy of you.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Your pride rejected him before,  
  Yet now for gold, and for your mother's will

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. No! \[*She shakes her head*.\]

*Courtier*.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Your nature knows your pride no more;  
  You honor him, a common woman still.<span class="margnote">17</span>

</div>

Did I not tell <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md) you to "serve the man
you love, and him you hate"?

*Vasantasenā*. I made a mistake in the cart, and thus I came hither. I
throw myself upon your protection.

*Courtier*. Do not fear. Come, I must deceive him. \[*He returns to
Sansthānaka*.\] Jackass, there is indeed a witch who makes her home in
the cart.

*Sansthānaka*. But shir, if a witch is living there, why aren't you
robbed? And if it's a thief, why aren't you eaten alive?

*Courtier*. Why try to determine that? But if we should go back on foot
through the gardens until we came to the city, to Ujjayinī, what harm
would that do?

*Sansthānaka*. And if we did, what then?

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

*Courtier*. Then we should have some exercise, and should avoid tiring
the bullocks.

*Sansthānaka*. All right. Sthāvaraka, my shlave, drive on. But no!
Shtop, shtop! I go on foot before gods and Brahmans? Not much! I'll go
in my cart, sho that people shall shee me a long way off, and shay
"There he goes, our mashter, the king's brother-in-law."

*Courtier*. \[*Aside*.\] It is hard to convert poison into medicine. So
be it, then. \[*Aloud*.\] Jackass, this is Vasantasenā, come to visit
you.

*Vasantasenā*. Heaven forbid!

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Gleefully*.\] Oh, oh! To visit me, an arishtocrat, a
man, a regular Vāsudeva?

*Courtier*. Yes.

*Sansthānaka*. This is an unheard-of piece of luck. That other time I
made her angry, sho now I'll fall at her feet and beg her pardon.

*Courtier*. Capital!

*Sansthānaka*. I'll fall at her feet myshelf. \[*He approaches
Vasantasenā*.\] Little mother, mamma dear, lishten to my prayer.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I fold my hands and fall before thy feet—  
Thine eyes are large, thy teeth are clean and neat,  
  Thy finger-nails are ten—forgive thy shlave  
What, love-tormented, he offended, shweet.<span
class="margnote">18</span>

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Angrily*.\] Leave me! Your words are an insult! \[*She
spurns him with her foot*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Wrathfully*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Thish head that mother and that mamma kissed,  
That never bent to worship god, I wist,  
Upon thish head she dared to plant her feet,  
Like jackals on the carrion they meet.<span class="margnote">19</span>

</div>

Sthāvaraka, you shlave, where did you pick her up?

*Sthāvaraka*. Master, the highway was blocked by villagers’ wagons. So I
stopped my cart near Chārudatta's orchard, and got out. And

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

while I was helping a villager with his wagon, I suppose she mistook
this cart for another, and climbed in.

*Sansthānaka*. Oho! she mishtook my cart for another? and didn't come to
shee me? Get out of my cart, get out! You're going to visit your poor
merchant's shon, are you? Those are my bullocks you're driving. Get out,
get out, you shlave! Get out, get out!

*Vasantasenā*. Truly, you honor me when you say that I came to see
Chārudatta. Now what must be, must be.

*Sansthānaka*. These hands of mine, ten-finger-naily,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

  These hands sho lotush-leafy,  
Are itching-anxious, girl, to daily  
  With you; and in a jiffy  
I'll drag Your Shweetness by the hair  
  From the cart wherein you ride,  
As did Jatāyu Bāli's fair,  
  The monkey Bāli's bride.<span class="margnote">20</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. So virtuous ladies may not be

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Insulted thus despitefully;  
Nor garden creepers may not be  
Robbed of their leaves so cruelly.<span class="margnote">21</span>

</div>

Stand up, man. I will help her to alight. Come, Vasantasenā!
\[*Vasantasenā alights and stands apart*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Aside*.\] The flame of wrath was kindled when she
despised my proposition, and now it blazes up because she kicked me. Sho
now I'll murder her. Good! Thish way. \[*Aloud*.\] Well, shir, what do
you want?

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A cloak with fringes hanging down and all,  
  Tied with a hundred shtrings? or good ragout,  
To make you shmack your greedy lips and call  
  "Chuhoo, chuhoo, chukku, chuhoo, chuhooo"?<span
class="margnote">22</span>

</div>

*Courtier*. Well?

*Sansthānaka*. Do me a favor.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

*Courtier*. Certainly. Anything, unless it be a sin.

*Sansthānaka*. There's not a shmell of a shin in it, shir. Not a
perfume!

*Courtier*. Speak, then.

*Sansthānaka*. Murder Vasantasenā.

*Courtier*. \[*Stopping his ears*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A tender lady, gem of this our city,  
  A courtezan whose love was stainless ever—  
If I should kill her, sinless, without pity,

</div>

*Sansthānaka*. I'll give you a boat. And beshides, in thish deserted
garden, who'll shee you murdering her?

*Courtier*. The regions ten, <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) the
forest gods, the sky,

*Sansthānaka*. Well then, put your cloak over her and murder her.

*Courtier*. You fool! You scoundrel!

*Sansthānaka*. The old hog is afraid of a shin. Never mind. I'll
pershuade Sthāvaraka, my shlave. Sthāvaraka, my little shon, my shlave,
I'll give you golden bracelets.

*Sthāvaraka*. And I'll wear them.

*Sansthānaka*. I'll have a golden sheat made for you.

*Sthāvaraka*. And I'll sit on it.

*Sansthānaka*. I'll give you all my leavings.

*Sthāvaraka*. And I'll eat them.

*Sansthānaka*. I'll make you the chief of all my shervants.

*Sthāvaraka*. Master, I'll be the chief.

*Sansthānaka*. You only have to attend to what I shay.

*Sthāvaraka*. Master, I will do anything, unless it be a sin.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

*Sansthānaka*. There's not a shmell of a shin in it.

*Sthāvaraka*. Then speak, master.

*Sansthānaka*. Murder Vasantasenā.

*Sthāvaraka*. Oh, master, be merciful! Unworthy as I am, I brought this
worthy lady hither, because she mistook this bullock-cart for another.

*Sansthānaka*. You shlave, ain't I your mashter?

*Sthāvaraka*. Master of my body, not of my character. Be merciful,
master, be merciful! I am afraid.

*Sansthānaka*. You're my shlave. Who are you afraid of?

*Sthāvaraka*. Of the other world, master.

*Sansthānaka*. Who is thish "other world"?

*Sthāvaraka*. Master, it is a rewarder of righteousness and sin.

*Sansthānaka*. What is the reward of righteoushness?

*Sthāvaraka*. To be like my master, with plenty of golden ornaments.

*Sansthānaka*. What is the reward of shin?

*Sthāvaraka*. To be like me, eating another man's bread. That is why I
will do no sin.

*Sansthānaka*. Sho you won't murder her? \[He beats him with all his
might.\]

*Sthāvaraka*. You may beat me, master. You may kill me, master. I will
do no sin.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

A luckless, lifelong slave am I,  
A slave I live, a slave I die;

</div>

*Vasantasenā*. Sir, I throw myself upon your protection.

*Courtier*. Pardon him, jackass! Well done, Sthāvaraka!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Does this poor, miserable slave  
Seek virtue's meed beyond the grave? <span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

To instant hell, whose sinful store  
Grows great, who know not virtue more?<span class="margnote">26</span>

And again:

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Aside*.\] The old jackal is afraid of a shin, and the
"lifelong shlave" is afraid of the other world. Who am I afraid of, I,
the king's brother-in-law, an arishtocrat, a man? \[*Aloud*.\] Well,
shervant, you "lifelong shlave," you can go. Go to your room and resht
and keep out of my way.

*Sthāvaraka*. Yes, master. \[*To Vasantasenā*.\] Madam, I have no
further power.

\[*Exit*.

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Girds up his loins*.\] Wait a minute, Vasantasenā,
wait a minute. I want to murder you.

*Courtier*. You will kill her before my eyes? \[*He seizes him by the
throat*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. \[*Falls to the ground*.\] Shir, you're murdering your
mashter. \[*He loses consciousness, but recovers*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I always fed him fat with meat,  
And gave him butter too, to eat;  
Now for the friend in need I search;  
Why does he leave me in the lurch?<span class="margnote">28</span>

\[*After reflection*.\] Good! I have an idea. The old jackal gave her a
hint by shaking his head at her. Sho I'll shend him away, and then I'll
murder Vasantasenā. That's the idea. \[*Aloud*.\] Shir, I was born in a
noble family as great as a wine-glass. How could I do that shin I shpoke
about? I jusht shaid it to make her love me.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

*Courtier*. Why should you boast of this your noble birth?

’Tis character that makes the man of worth;  
But thorns and weeds grow rank in fertile earth.<span

*Sansthānaka*. She's ashamed to confessh her love when you're here.
Please go. My shervant Sthāvaraka has gone too after getting a beating.
He may be running away. Catch him, shir, and come back with him.

*Courtier*. \[*Aside*.\]

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Vasantasenā is too proud to own,

</div>

\[*Aloud*.\] Very well. I go.

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Seizing the hem of his garment*.\] Did I not throw
myself upon your protection?

*Courtier*. Do not fear, Vasantasenā. Jackass, Vasantasenā is a pledge,
committed to your hand.

*Sansthānaka*. All right. Jusht let her be committed to my hand. It's a
pledge that I'll execute.

*Courtier*. Are you honest?

*Sansthānaka*. Honesht.

*Courtier*. \[*Takes a few steps*.\] No! If I go, the wretch might kill
her. I will conceal myself for a moment, and see what he intends to do.
\[*He stands apart*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. Good! I'll murder her. But no! Perhaps thish tricky
trickshter, thish Brahman, thish old jackal, has gone and hidden
himshelf; he might raise a howl like the jackal he is. I'll jusht do
thish to deceive him. \[*He gathers flowers and adorns himself*.\]
Vasantasenā, my love, my love! Come!

*Courtier*. Yes, he has turned lover. Good! I am content. I will go.

\[*Exit*.

And I, who have loved the mango-tree, I cannot cling to the locust-tree.

*Sansthānaka*. Wench, you make that poor little Chārudatta into a
mango-tree, and me you call a locusht-tree, not even an acacia! That's
the way you abuse me, and even yet you remember Chārudatta.

*Vasantasenā*. Why should I not remember him who dwells in my heart?

*Sansthānaka*. Thish very minute I'm going to shtrangle "him who dwells
in your heart," and you too. Shtand shtill, you poor-merchant-man's
lover!

*Vasantasenā*. Oh speak, oh speak again these words that do me honor!

*Sansthānaka*. Jusht let poor Chārudatta—the shon of a shlave-reshcue
you now!

*Vasantasenā*. He would rescue me, if he saw me.

*Sansthānaka*. Is he the king of gods? the royal ape?

Shon of a nymph? or wears a demon's shape? <span id="page_125">p.

\[*He raises his arm to strike her*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. Mother! where are you? Oh, Chārudatta! my heart's longing
is unfulfilled, and now I die! I will scream for help. No! It would
bring shame on Vasantasenā, should she scream for help. Heaven bless

Good! The old jackal will be here in a minute. I'll shtep ashide and
wait. \[*He does so*.\]

\[*Enter the courtier, with Sthāvaraka*.\]

*Courtier*. I have persuaded the servant Sthāvaraka to come back, and
now I will look for the jackass. \[*He walks about and looks around
him*.\] But see! A tree has fallen by the roadside, and killed a woman
in its fall. O cruel! How couldst thou do this deed of shame? And when I
see that a woman was slain by thy fatal fall, I too am felled to the
earth. Truly, my heart's fear for Vasantasenā was an evil omen. Oh,
heaven grant that all may yet be well! \[*He approaches Sansthānaka*.\]
Jackass, I have persuaded your servant Sthāvaraka to return.

*Sansthānaka*. How do you do, shir? Sthāvaraka, my little shon, my
shlave, how do you do?

*Sthāvaraka*. Well, thank you.

*Courtier*. Give me my pledge.

*Sansthānaka*. What pledge?

*Courtier*. Vasantasenā.

*Sansthānaka*. She's gone.

*Courtier*. Where?

*Sansthānaka*. Right after you.

*Courtier*. \[*Doubtfully*.\] No, she did not go in that direction.

*Sansthānaka*. In what direction did you go?

*Courtier*. Toward the east.

*Sansthānaka*. Well, she went shouth. <span

*Courtier*. So did I.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

*Sansthānaka*. She went north.

*Courtier*. This is nonsense. My heart is not satisfied. Speak the
truth.

*Sansthānaka*. I shwear by your head, shir, and my own feet. You may be
easy in your heart. I murdered her.

*Courtier*. \[*Despairingly*.\] You really killed her?

*Sansthānaka*. If you don't believe my words, then shee the firsht
heroic deed of Sansthānaka, the king's brother-in-law. \[*He points out
the body*.\]

*Courtier*. Alas! Ah, woe is me! \[*He falls in a swoon*.\]

*Sansthānaka*. Hee, hee! The gentleman is calm enough now!

*Sthāvaraka*. Oh, sir! Come to yourself! I am the first murderer, for I
brought the bullock-cart hither without looking into it.

*Courtier*. \[*Comes to himself. Mournfully*.\] Alas, Vasantasenā!

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The stream of courtesy is dried away,

Thy mirth-shored stream, that kind and healing river—  
Alas! is perished, lost, and gone forever!<span

\[*Aside*.\] Ah! Perhaps the wretch means to lay this sin to my charge.
I must go hence. \[*He walks about. Sansthānaka approaches and holds him

*Sansthānaka*. Aha! Firsht you murder Vasantasenā, then you abuse me,
and now where will you run to? And sho a man like me hasn't anybody to

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

*Sansthānaka*. Firsht you murder Vasantasenā in my old garden

*Courtier*. \[*Aside*.\] It would be folly to remain here. Well, I will
go and join myself to Sharvilaka, Chandanaka, and the rest.

\[*Exit*.

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

*Sansthānaka*. Go to hell. Well, my little shon Sthāvaraka, what kind of
a thing is thish that I've done?

*Sthāvaraka*. Master, you have committed a terrible crime.

*Sansthānaka*. Shlave! What do you mean by talking about a crime? Well,
I'll do it thish way. \[*He takes various ornaments from his person*.\]
Take these gems. I give ’em to you. Whenever I want to wear them, I'll
take them back again, but the resht of the time they are yours.

*Sthāvaraka*. They should be worn only by my master. What have I to do
with such things?

*Sansthānaka*. Go along! Take these bullocks, and wait in the tower of
my palace until I come.

*Sthāvaraka*. Yes, master.

\[*Exit*.

*Sansthānaka*. The gentleman has made himshelf invisible. He wanted to
save himshelf. And the shlave I'll put in irons in the palace tower, and
keep him there. And sho the shecret will be shafe. I'll go along, but
firsht I'll take a look at her. Is she dead, or shall I murder her
again? \[*He looks at Vasantasenā*.\] Dead as a door-nail! Good! I'll
cover her with thish cloak. No, it has my name on it. Shome honesht man
might recognize it. Well, here are shome dry leaves that the wind has
blown into a heap. I'll cover her with them. \[*He does so, then pauses
to reflect*.\] Good! I'll do it thish way. I'll go to court at once, and
there I'll lodge a complaint. I'll shay that the merchant Chārudatta
enticed Vasantasenā into my old garden Pushpakaranda, and killed her for
her money.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Yesh, Chārudatta musht be shlaughtered now,  
And I'll invent the plan, forgetting pity;

Now I'm ready to go. \[*He starts to go away, but perceives something
that frightens him*.\] Goodnessh gracioush me! Wherever I go, thish
damned monk comes with his yellow robes. I bored a hole

in his nose once and drove him around, and he hates me. Perhaps he'll
shee me, and will tell people that I murdered her. How shall I eshcape?
\[*He looks about*.\] Aha! I'll jump over the wall where it is half
fallen down, and eshcape that way.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I run, I run, I go,  
In heaven, on earth below,

</div>

\[*Exit*.\]

\[*Enter hurriedly the Buddhist monk, ex-shampooer*.\]

*Monk*. I've washed these rags of mine. Shall I let them dry on a
branch? no, the monkeys would steal them. On the ground? the dust would
make them dirty again. Well then, where shall I spread them out to dry?
\[*He looks about*.\] Ah, here is a pile of dry leaves which the wind
has blown into a heap. I'll spread them out on that. \[*He does so*.\]
Buddha be praised! \[*He sits down*.\] Now I will repeat a hymn of the
faith.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Who slays the Five Men, and the Female Bane,  
  By whom protection to the Town is given,  
By whom the Outcaste impotent is slain,  
  He cannot fail to enter into heaven. (2)

</div>

After all, what have I to do with heaven, before I have paid my debt to
Vasantasenā, my sister in Buddha? She bought my freedom for ten
gold-pieces from the gamblers, and since that day I regard myself as her
property. \[*He looks about*.\] What was that? a sigh that arose from
the leaves? It cannot be.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The heated breezes heat the leaves,  
The wetted garment wets the leaves,  
And so, I guess, the scattered leaves  
Curl up like any other leaves.<span class="margnote">46</span>

</div>

\[*Vasantasenā begins to recover consciousness, and stretches out her
hand*.\]

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

*Monk*. Ah, there appears a woman's hand, adorned with beautiful gems.
What! a second hand? \[*He examines it with the greatest care*.\] It
seems to me, I recognize this hand. Yes, there is no doubt about it.
Surely, this is the hand that saved me. But I must see for myself. \[*He
uncovers the body, looks at it, and recognizes it*.\] It is my sister in
Buddha. \[*Vasantasenā pants for water*.\] Ah, she seeks water, and the
pond is far away. What shall I do? An idea! I will hold this robe over
her and let it drip upon her. \[*He does so. Vasantasenā recovers
consciousness, and raises herself: The monk fans her with his
garment*.\]

*Vasantasenā*. Who are you, sir?

*Monk*. Has my sister in Buddha forgotten him whose freedom she bought
for ten gold-pieces?

*Vasantasenā*. I seem to remember, but not just as you say. It were
better that I had slept never to waken.

*Monk*. What happened here, sister in Buddha?

*Vasantasenā*. \[*Despairingly*.\] Nothing but what is fitting—for a
courtezan.

*Monk*. Sister in Buddha, support yourself by this creeper <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md) that clings to the tree, and rise to your
feet. \[*He bends down the creeper. Vasantasenā takes it in her hand,
and rises*.\]

*Monk*. In yonder monastery dwells one who is my sister in the faith.
There shall my sister in Buddha be restored before she returns home. You
must walk very slowly, sister. \[*He walks about and looks around
him*.\] Make way, good people, make way! This is a young lady, and I am
a monk, yet my conduct is above reproach.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The man whose hands, whose lips are free from greed,  
Who curbs his senses, he is man indeed.
