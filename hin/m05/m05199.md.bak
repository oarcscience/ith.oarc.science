### SECTION CXCIX

"Vaisampayana said, 'Like Duryodhana, king Yudhishthira also, the son of
Kunti and Dharma, ordered out, O Bharata, his heroic warriors headed by
Dhrishtadyumna. Indeed, he ordered that slayer of foes and commander of
force, that leader, steady in prowess, of the Chedis, the Kasis, and the
Karushas, *viz*., Dhrishtaketu, as also Virata, and Drupada, and
Yuyudhana, and Sikhandin, and those two mighty bowmen, those two princes
of Panchala, *viz*., Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas, to set out. Those brave
warriors, cased in handsome coats of mail and decked with golden
ear-rings, blazed forth like fires on the sacrificial

altar when fed with clarified butter. Indeed, those mighty bowmen looked
resplendent like the planets in the firmament. Then that bull among men
king Yudhishthira, having duly honoured all his combatants, ordered them
to march. And king Yudhishthira ordered excellent provisions of food for
those high-souled kings with their troops consisting of infantry, and
elephants and horses, and with all their followers, as also for all
those that subsisted on mechanical arts. And the son of Pandu first
ordered Abhimanyu, and Vrihanta, and the five sons of Draupadi, to march
with Dhrishtadyumna at their head. And he then despatched Bhima, and
Dhananjaya the son of Pandu, in the second division of his forces. And
the din made by the men moving and running about for harnessing their
steeds and elephants and loading the cars with implements of battle, and
the shouts of the cheerful combatants, seemed to touch the very heavens.
And last of all, the king marched himself, accompanied by Virata and
Drupada and the other monarchs (on his side). And that army of fierce
bowmen commanded by Dhrishtadyumna, hitherto stationed in one place, but
now extended into columns for marching, looked like the (impetuous)
current of Ganga. The then intelligent Yudhishthira depending on his
wisdom, disposed his divisions in a different order, confounding the
sons of Dhritarashtra. And the son of Pandu ordered that those mighty
bowmen, the (five) sons of Draupadi and Abhimanyu, and Nakula, and
Sahadeva, and all the Prabhadrakas, and ten thousand horses, and two
thousand elephants, and ten thousand foot-soldiers, and five hundred
cars, constituting the first irresistible division of his army, should
be placed under the command of Bhimasena. And he placed in the middle
division of his army Virata and Jayatsena, and those two mighty
car-warriors, *viz*., Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja, the two high-souled
princes of Panchala, both endued with great prowess and both armed with
mace and bow. And in this middle division marched Vasudeva and
Dhananjaya. There were (placed) combatants highly accomplished in arms
and burning with anger. Amongst them were steeds ridden by brave
warriors, and five thousand elephants, and crowds of cars all around.
And foot-soldiers in thousands, that were all brave and armed with bows,
swords, and maces, marched behind them, as thousand marched before them.
And in that part of that sea of troops, where Yudhishthira himself was,
there were stationed numerous lords of earth. And there also were
thousands of elephants, and steeds by ten thousands, and cars and
foot-soldiers also by thousands. And there also marched, O bull among
kings, Chekitana with his own large force, and king Dhrishtaketu, the
leader of the Chedis. And there also was that mighty bowman, Satyaki,
the foremost car-warrior of the Vrishnis, that mighty combatant,
surrounded by hundreds and thousands of cars and leading (them to
battle)! And those bulls among men, Kshatrahan and Kshatradeva, mounted
on their cars, marched behind, protecting the rear. And there (in the
rear) were the waggons, stalls, uniforms, vehicles and draft

animals. There also were thousands of elephants and horses by tens of
thousands. And taking all the invalids and women, and all that were
emaciated and weak, and all the animals carrying his treasures, and all
his granaries, with the aid of his elephant-divisions, Yudhishthira
marched slowly. And he was followed by Sauchitti, who steadily adhered
to truth and was invincible in battle, and Srenimat, and Vasudeva and
Vibhu, the son of the ruler of Kasi, with twenty thousand cars, and
hundred million steeds of high mettle, each bearing scores of bells on
its limbs, and twenty thousand smiting elephants with tusks as long as
plough-shares, all of good breed and divided temples and all resembling
moving masses of clouds. Indeed, these usually walked behind those
monarchs. Besides these, O Bharata, the elephants that Yudhishthira had
in his seven *Akshauhinis*, numbering seventy thousand with humour
trickling down their trunks and from their mouths, and resembling (on
that account) showering clouds, also followed the king, like moving
hills.

'Thus was arrayed that terrible force of the intelligent son of Kunti.
And relying upon that force he battled with Suyodhana, the son of
Dhritarashtra. Besides those already named, other men by hundreds and
thousands and tens of thousands, in divisions numbering by thousands,
followed (the Pandava army), roaring loudly. And the warriors by
thousands and ten thousands, filled with joy, beat their drums by
thousands and blew conchs by tens of thousands!'"
