<p>3. Not (i.e. the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;c. cannot be) that which is inferred, (i.e. the pradh&acirc;na), on account of the terms not denoting it.</p> 
<p>While there has been shown a special reason in favour of Brahman (being the abode), there is no such special reason in favour of anything else. Hence he (the s&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra) says that that which is inferred, i.e. the pradh&acirc;na assumed by the S&acirc;<u>n</u>khya-sm<i>ri</i>ti, is not to be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;c.--Why?--On account of the terms not denoting it. For the sacred text does not contain any term intimating the non-intelligent pradh&acirc;na, on the ground of which we might understand the latter to be the general cause or abode; while such terms as 'he who perceives all and knows all' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 9) intimate an intelligent being opposed to the pradh&acirc;na in nature.--For the same reason the air also cannot be accepted as the abode of heaven, earth, and so on.</p>
