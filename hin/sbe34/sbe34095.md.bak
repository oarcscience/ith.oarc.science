*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

26\. Also (beings) above them, (viz. men) (are qualified for the study
and practice of the Veda), on account of the possibility (of it),
according to Bâdarâya*n*a.

It has been said above that the passage about him who is of the size of
a thumb has reference to the human heart, because men are entitled to
study and act according to the *s*âstra. This gives us an occasion for
the following discussion.--It is true that the *s*âstra entitles men,
but, at the same time, there is no exclusive rule entitling men only to
the knowledge of Brahman; the teacher, Bâdarâya*n*a, rather thinks that
the *s*âstra entitles those (classes of beings) also which are above
men, viz. gods, and so on.--On what account?--On the account of
possibility.--For in their cases also the different causes on which the
qualification depends, such as having certain desires, and so on, may
exist. In the first place, the gods also may have the desire of final
release, caused by the reflection that all effects, objects, and powers
are non-permanent. In the second place, they may be capable of it as
their corporeality appears from mantras, arthavâdas, itihâsas,
purâ*n*as, and ordinary experience. In the third place, there is no
prohibition (excluding them like *S*ûdras). Nor does, in the fourth
place, the scriptural rule about the upanayana-ceremony annul their
title; for that

ceremony merely subserves the study of the Veda, and to the gods the
Veda is manifest of itself (without study). That the gods, moreover, for
the purpose of acquiring knowledge, undergo discipleship, and the like,
appears from such scriptural passages as 'One hundred and one years
Indra lived as a disciple with Pra*g*âpati' (*Kh.* Up. VIII, ii, 3), and
'Bh*ri*gu Vâru*n*i went to his father Varu*n*a, saying, "Sir, teach me
Brahman"' (Taitt. Up. III, 1).--And the reasons which have been given
above against gods and *ri*shis being entitled to perform religious
works (such as sacrifices), viz. the circumstance of there being no
other gods (to whom the gods could offer sacrifices), and of there being
no other *ri*shis (who could be invoked during the sacrifice), do not
apply to the case of branches of knowledge. For Indra and the other
gods, when applying themselves to knowledge, have no acts to perform
with a view to Indra, and so on; nor have Bh*ri*gu and other *ri*shis,
in the same case, to do anything with the circumstance of their
belonging to the same gotra as Bh*ri*gu, &c. What, then, should stand in
the way of the gods' and *ri*shis' right to acquire
knowledge?--Moreover, the passage about that which is of the size of a
thumb remains equally valid, if the right of the gods, &c. is admitted;
it has then only to be explained in each particular case by a reference
to the particular size of the thumb (of the class of beings spoken of).
