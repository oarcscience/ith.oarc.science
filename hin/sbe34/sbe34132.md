21\. (The initial statement identifies the individual soul and the
highest Self) because the soul when it will depart (from the body) is
such (i.e. one with the highest Self); thus Au*d*ulomi thinks.

The individual soul which is inquinated by the contact with its
different limiting adjuncts, viz. body, senses, and mind (mano-buddhi),
attains through the instrumentality of knowledge, meditation, and so on,
a state of complete serenity, and thus enables itself, when passing at
some future time out of the body, to become one with the highest Self;
hence the initial statement in which it is represented as non-different
from the highest Self. This is the opinion of the teacher
Au*d*ulomi.--Thus Scripture says, 'That serene being arising from this
body appears in its own form as soon as it has approached the highest
light' (*Kh*. Up. VIII, 12, 3).--In another place Scripture intimates,
by means of the simile of the rivers, that name and form abide in the
individual soul, 'As

the flowing rivers disappear in the sea, having lost their name and
their form, thus a wise man freed from name and form goes to the divine
Person who is greater than the great' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8). I.e. as the
rivers losing the names and forms abiding in them disappear in the sea,
so the individual soul also losing the name and form abiding in it
becomes united with the highest person. That the latter half of the
passage has the meaning here assigned to it, follows from the
parallelism which we must assume to exist between the two members of the
comparison <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_248"></span>[278:1](sbe34132.htm#fr_248) Bhâmatî: The
individual soul is absolutely different from the highest Self; it is
inquinated by the contact with its different limiting adjuncts. But it
is spoken of, in the Upanishad, as non-different from the highest Self
because after having purified itself by means of knowledge and
meditation it may pass out of the body and become one with the highest
Self. The text of the Upanishad thus transfers a future state of
non-difference to that time when difference actually exists. Compare the
saying of the Pâ*ñk*arâtrikas: 'Up to the moment of emancipation being
reached the soul and the highest Self are different. But the emancipated
soul is no longer different from the highest Self, since there is no
further cause of difference.'--The technical name of the doctrine
advocated by Au*d*ulomi is satyabhedavâda.
