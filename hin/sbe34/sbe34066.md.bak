*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

himself as measured by a span, i.e. he specially manifests himself for
the benefit of his worshippers in some special places, such as the heart
and the like, where he may be perceived. Hence, according to the opinion
of the teacher Â*s*marathya, the scriptural passage which speaks of him
who is measured by a span may refer to the highest Lord.
