12\. And on account of (Scripture) separating (the akshara) from that
whose nature is different (from Brahman).

Also on account of the reason stated in this Sûtra Brahman only is to be
considered as the Imperishable, and the supporting of all things up to
ether is to be looked upon as the work of Brahman only, not of anything
else. The meaning of the Sûtra is as follows. Whatever things other than
Brahman might possibly be thought to be denoted by the term 'akshara,'
from the nature of all those things Scripture separates the akshara
spoken of as the

support of all things up to ether. The scriptural passage alluded to is
III, 8, 11, 'That akshara, O Gârgî, is unseen but seeing, unheard but
hearing, unperceived but perceiving, unknown but knowing.' Here the
designation of being unseen, &c. agrees indeed with the pradhâna also,
but not so the designation of seeing, &c., as the pradhâna is
non-intelligent.--Nor can the word akshara denote the embodied soul with
its limiting conditions, for the passage following on the one quoted
declares that there is nothing different from the Self ('there is
nothing that sees but it, nothing that hears but it, nothing that
perceives but it, nothing that knows but it'); and, moreover, limiting
conditions are expressly denied (of the akshara) in the passage, 'It is
without eyes, without ears, without speech, without mind,' &c. (III, 8,
8). An embodied soul without limiting conditions does not exist <span

that the Imperishable is nothing else but the highest Brahman.

against the possible attempt to explain the passage last quoted as
referring to the embodied soul.
