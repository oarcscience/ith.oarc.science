Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

25\. And on account of both (i.e. the origin and the dissolution of the
world) being directly declared (to have Brahman for their material
cause).

This Sûtra supplies a further argument for Brahman's

being the general material cause.--Brahman is the material cause of the
world for that reason also that the origination as well as the
dissolution of the world is directly spoken of in the sacred texts as
having Brahman for their material cause, 'All these beings take their
rise from the ether and return into the ether' (*Kh*. Up. I, 9, 1).
That that from which some other thing springs and into which it returns
is the material cause of that other thing is well known. Thus the earth,
for instance, is the material cause of rice, barley, and the like.--The
word 'directly' (in the Sûtra) notifies that there is no other material
cause, but that all this sprang from the ether only.--Observation
further teaches that effects are not re-absorbed into anything else but
their material causes.
