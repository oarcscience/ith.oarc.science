37\. And on account of (Gautama) proceeding (to initiate *G*âbâla) on
the ascertainment of (his) not being that (i.e. a *S*ûdra).

The *S*ûdras are not qualified for that reason also that Gautama, having
ascertained *G*âbâla not to be a *S*ûdra from his speaking the truth,
proceeded to initiate and instruct him. 'None who is not a Brâhma*n*a
would thus speak out. Go and fetch fuel, friend, I shall initiate you.
You have not swerved from the truth' (*Kh*. Up. IV, 4, 5); which
scriptural passage furnishes an inferential sign (of the *S*ûdras not
being capable of initiation).
