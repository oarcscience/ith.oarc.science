*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

10\. And because the objections (raised by the Sâ<u>n</u>khya against
the Vedânta doctrine) apply to his view also.

The doctrine of our opponent is liable to the very same objections which
he urges against us, viz. in the following manner.--The objection that
this world cannot have sprung from Brahman on account of its difference
of character applies no less to the doctrine of the pradhâna being the
cause of the world; for that doctrine also assumes that from a pradhâna
devoid of sound and other qualities a world is produced which possesses
those very qualities. The beginning of an effect different in character
being thus admitted, the Sâ<u>n</u>khya is equally driven to the
doctrine that before the actual beginning the effect was non-existent.
And, moreover, it being admitted (by the Sâ<u>n</u>khya also) that at
the time of reabsorption the effect passes back into the state of
non-distinction from the cause, the case of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya here also
is the same as ours.--And, further, if

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (as the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya also must admit) at the time of reabsorption the
differences of all the special effects are obliterated and pass into a
state of general non-distinction, the special fixed conditions, which
previous to reabsorption were the causes of the different worldly
existence of each soul, can, at the time of a new creation, no longer be
determined, there being no cause for them; and if you assume them to be
determined without a cause, you are driven to the admission that even
the released souls have to re-enter a state of bondage, there being
equal absence of a cause (in the case of the released and the
non-released souls). And if you try to avoid this conclusion by assuming
that at the time of reabsorption some individual differences pass into
the state of non-distinction, others not, we reply that in that case the
latter could not be considered as effects of the pradhâna <span
id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_277.md).--It thus appears that all those
difficulties (raised by the Sâ<u>n</u>khya) apply to both views, and
cannot therefore be urged against either only. But as either of the two
doctrines must necessarily be accepted, we are strengthened-—by the
outcome of the above discussion--in the opinion that the alleged
difficulties are no real difficulties <span

effects of the pradhâna they must as such be reabsorbed into it at the
time of general reabsorption.

Vedânta view is preferable because the nullity of the objections has
already been demonstrated in its case.
