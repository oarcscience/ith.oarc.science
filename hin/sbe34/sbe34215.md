Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

39\. And on account of the impossibility of rulership (on the part of
the Lord).

The Lord of the argumentative philosophers is an untenable hypothesis,
for the following reason also.--Those philosophers are obliged to assume
that by his influence the Lord produces action in the pradhâna, &c. just
as the potter produces motion in the clay, &c. But this cannot be
admitted; for the pradhâna, which is devoid of colour and other
qualities, and therefore not an object of perception, is on that account
of an altogether different nature from clay and the like, and hence
cannot be looked upon as the object of the Lord's action.
