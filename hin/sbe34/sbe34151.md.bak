12\. Thereby those (theories) also which are not accepted by competent
persons are explained.

Hitherto we have refuted those objections against the Vedânta-texts
which, based on reasoning, take their stand on the doctrine of the
pradhâna being the cause of the world; (which doctrine deserves to be
refuted first), because it stands near to our Vedic system, is supported
by somewhat weighty arguments, and has, to a certain extent, been
adopted by some authorities who follow the Veda.--But now some
dull-witted persons might think that another objection founded on
reasoning might be raised against the Vedânta, viz. on the ground of the
atomic doctrine. The Sûtrakâra, therefore, extends to the latter
objection the refutation of the former, considering that by the conquest
of the most dangerous adversary the conquest of the minor enemies is
already virtually accomplished. Other doctrines, as, for instance, the
atomic doctrine of which no part has been accepted by

either Manu or Vyâsa or other authorities, are to be considered as
'explained,' i.e. refuted by the same reasons which enabled us to
dispose of the pradhâna doctrine. As the reasons on which the refutation
hinges are the same, there is no room for further doubt. Such common
arguments are the impotence of reasoning to fathom the depth of the
transcendental cause of the world, the ill-foundedness of mere
Reasoning, the impossibility of final release, even in case of the
conclusions being shaped 'otherwise' (see the preceding Sûtra), the
conflict of Scripture and Reasoning, and so on.
