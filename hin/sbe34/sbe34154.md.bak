15\. And because only on the existence (of the cause) (the effect) is
observed.

For the following reason also the effect is non-different from the
cause, because only when the cause exists the effect is observed to
exist, not when it does not exist. For instance, only when the clay
exists the jar is observed to exist, and the cloth only when the threads
exist. That it is not a general rule that when one thing exists another
is also observed to exist, appears, for instance, from the fact, that a
horse which is other (different) from a cow is not observed to exist
only when a cow exists. Nor is the jar observed to exist only when the
potter exists; for in that case non-difference

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

does not exist, although the relation between the two is that of an
operative cause and its effect <span
id="fr_293"></span>[1](#fn_293.md).--But--it may be objected--even in the
case of things other (i.e. non-identical) we find that the observation
of one thing regularly depends on the existence of another; smoke, for
instance, is observed only when fire exists.--We reply that this is
untrue, because sometimes smoke is observed even after the fire has been
extinguished; as, for instance, in the case of smoke being kept by
herdsmen in jars.--Well, then--the objector will say--let us add to
smoke a certain qualification enabling us to say that smoke of such and
such a kind <span id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_294.md) does not exist unless
fire exists.--Even thus, we reply, your objection is not valid, because
we declare that the reason for assuming the non-difference of cause and
effect is the fact of the internal organ (buddhi) being affected
(impressed) by cause and effect jointly <span
id="fr_295"></span>[3](#fn_295.md). And that does not take place in the
case of fire and smoke.--Or else we have to read (in the Sûtra)
'bhâvât,' and to translate, 'and on account of the existence or
observation.' The non-difference of cause and effect results not only
from Scripture but also from the existence of perception. For the
non-difference of the two is perceived, for instance, in an aggregate of
threads, where we do not perceive a thing called 'cloth,' in addition to
the threads, but merely threads running lengthways and crossways. So
again, in the threads we perceive finer threads (the aggregate

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

of which is identical with the grosser threads), in them again finer
threads, and so on. On the ground of this our perception we conclude
that the finest parts which we can perceive are ultimately identical
with their causes, viz. red, white, and black (the colours of fire,
water, and earth, according to *Kh*. Up. VI, 4); those, again, with air,
the latter with ether, and ether with Brahman, which is one and without
a second. That all means of proof lead back to Brahman (as the ultimate
cause of the world; not to pradhâna, &c.), we have already explained.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_293"></span>[331:1](sbe34154.htm#fr_293.md) So that from the
instance of the potter and the jar we cannot conclude that the relation
of clay and the jar is only that of nimitta and naimittika, not that of
non-difference.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[331:2](sbe34154.htm#fr_294.md) For instance,
smoke extending in a long line whose base is connected with some object
on the surface of the earth.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[331:3](sbe34154.htm#fr_295.md) I.e. (as Ân. Gi.
explains) because we assume the relation of cause and effect not merely
on the ground of the actual existence of one thing depending on that
upon another, but on the additional ground of the mental existence, the
consciousness of the one not being possible without the consciousness of
the other.--Tadbhâvânuvidhâyibhâvatvam tadbhânânuvidhâyibhânatva*m* *k*â
