*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

20\. (The circumstance of the soul being represented as the object of
sight) indicates the fulfilment of the promissory statement; so
Â*s*marathya thinks.

The fact that the text proclaims as the object of sight that Self which
is denoted as something, dear indicates the fulfilment of the promise
made in the passages, 'When the Self is known all this is known,' 'All
this is that Self.' For if the individual soul were different from the
highest Self, the knowledge of the latter would not imply the knowledge
of the former, and thus the promise that through the knowledge of one
thing everything is to be known would not be fulfilled. Hence the
initial

statement aims at representing the individual Self and the highest Self
as non-different for the purpose of fulfilling the promise made.--This
is the opinion of the teacher Â*s*marathya <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_247"></span>[277:1](sbe34131.htm#fr_247.md) The comment of the
Bhâmatî on the Sûtra runs as follows: As the sparks issuing from a fire
are not absolutely different from the fire, because they participate in
the nature of the fire; and, on the other hand, are not absolutely
non-different from the fire, because in that case they could be
distinguished neither from the fire nor from each other; so the
individual souls also--which are effects of Brahman--are neither
absolutely different from Brahman, for that would mean that they are not
of the nature of intelligence; nor absolutely non-different from
Brahman, because in that case they could not be distinguished from each
other, and because, if they were identical with Brahman and therefore
omniscient, it would be useless to give them any instruction. Hence the
individual souls are somehow different from Brahman and somehow
non-different.--The technical name of the doctrine here represented by
Â*s*marathya is bhedâbhedavâda.
