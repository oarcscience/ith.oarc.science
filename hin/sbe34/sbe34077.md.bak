8\. The bhûman (is Brahman), as the instruction about it is additional
to that about the state of deep sleep (i.e. the vital air which remains
awake even in the state of deep sleep).

We read (*Kh*. Up. VII, 23; 24), 'That which is much (bhûman) we must
desire to understand.--Sir, I desire to understand it.--Where one sees
nothing else, hears nothing else, understands nothing else, that is what
is much (bhûman). Where one sees something else, hears something else,
understands something else, that is the Little.'--Here the doubt arises
whether that which is much is the vital air (prâ*n*a) or the highest
Self.--Whence the doubt?--The word 'bhûman,' taken by itself, means the
state of being much, according to its derivation as taught by Pâ*n*ini,
VI, 4, 158. Hence there is felt the want of a specification showing what
constitutes the Self of that muchness. Here there presents itself at
first the approximate passage, 'The vital air is more than hope' (*Kh*.
Up. VII, 15, 1), from which we may conclude that the vital air is
bhûman.--On the other hand, we meet at the beginning of the chapter,
where the general topic is stated, with the following passage, 'I have
heard from men like you that he who knows the Self overcomes grief. I am
in grief. Do, Sir, help me over this grief of mine;' from which passage
it would appear that the bhûman is the highest Self.--Hence there arises
a doubt as to which of the two alternatives is to be embraced, and which
is to be set aside.

The pûrvapakshin maintains that the bhûman is the vital air, since there
is found no further series of questions and answers as to what is more.
For while we meet with a series of questions and answers (such as, 'Sir,
is there something which is more than a name?'--'Speech is more than
name.'--'Is there something which is more than speech?'--' Mind is more
than speech'), which extends from name up to vital air, we do not meet
with a similar question and answer as to what might be more than vital
air (such as, 'Is there something

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

which is more than vital air?'--'Such and such a thing is more than
vital air'). The text rather at first declares at length (in the
passage, 'The vital air is more than hope,' &c.) that the vital air is
more than all the members of the series from name up to hope; it then
acknowledges him who knows the vital air to be an ativâdin, i.e. one who
makes a statement surpassing the preceding statements (in the passage,
'Thou art an ativâdin. He may say I am an ativâdin; he need not deny
it'); and it thereupon (in the passage, 'But he in reality is an
ativâdin who declares something beyond by means of the True' <span
id="fr_175"></span>[1](#fn_175).md),--not leaving off, but rather
continuing to refer to the quality of an ativâdin which is founded on
the vital air,--proceeds, by means of the series beginning with the
True, to lead over to the bhûman; so that we conclude the meaning to be
that the vital air is the bhûman.--But, if the bhûman is interpreted to
mean the vital air, how have we to explain the passage in which the
bhûman is characterised. 'Where one sees nothing else?' &c.--As, the
pûrvapakshin replies, in the state of deep sleep we observe a cessation
of all activity, such as seeing, &c., on the part of the organs merged
in the vital air, the vital air itself may be characterised by a passage
such as, 'Where one sees nothing else.' Similarly, another scriptural
passage (Pra. Up. IV, 2; 3) describes at first (in the words, 'He does
not hear, he does not see,' &c.) the state of deep sleep as
characterised by the cessation of the activity of all bodily organs, and
then by declaring that in that state the vital air, with its five
modifications, remains awake ('The fires of the prâ*n*as are awake in
that town'), shows the vital air to occupy the principal position in the
state of deep sleep.--That passage also, which speaks of the bliss of
the bhûman ('The bhûman is bliss,' *Kh*. Up. VII, 23), can be reconciled
with our explanation, because Pra. Up. IV, 6 declares bliss to attach to
the state of deep sleep ('Then that god sees no dreams and at that time
that happiness arises in his body').--Again, the statement, 'The bhûman
is immortality' (*Kh*. Up. VII, 24, 1), may

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

likewise refer to the vital air; for another scriptural passage says,
'Prâ*n*a is immortality' (Kau. Up. III, 2).--But how can the view
according to which the bhûman is the vital air be reconciled with the
fact that in the beginning of the chapter the knowledge of the Self is
represented as the general topic ('He who knows the Self overcomes
grief,' &c.)?--By the Self there referred to, the pûrvapakshin replies,
nothing else is meant but the vital air. For the passage, 'The vital air
is father, the vital air is mother, the vital air is brother, the vital
air is sister, the vital air is teacher, the vital air is Brâhma*n*a'
(*Kh.* Up. VII, 15, 1), represents the vital air as the Self of
everything. As, moreover, the passage, 'As the spokes of a wheel rest in
the nave, so all this rests in prâ*n*a,' declares the prâ*n*a to be the
Self of all--by means of a comparison with the spokes and the nave of a
wheel--the prâ*n*a may be conceived under the form of bhûman, i.e.
plenitude.--Bhûman, therefore, means the vital air.

To this we make the following reply.--Bhûman can mean the highest Self
only, not the vital air.--Why?--'On account of information being given
about it, subsequent to bliss.' The word 'bliss' (samprasâda) means the
state of deep sleep, as may be concluded, firstly, from the etymology of
the word ('In it he, i.e. man, is altogether
pleased--samprasîdati')--and, secondly, from the fact of samprasâda
being mentioned in the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka together with the state of
dream and the waking state. And as in the state of deep sleep the vital
air remains awake, the word 'samprasâda' is employed in the Sûtra to
denote the vital air; so that the Sûtra means, 'on account of
information being given about the bhûman, subsequently to (the
information given about) the vital air.' If the bhûman were the vital
air itself, it would be a strange proceeding to make statements about
the bhûman in addition to the statements about the vital air. For in the
preceding passages also we do not meet, for instance, with a statement
about name subsequent to the previous statement about name (i.e. the
text does not say 'name is more than name'), but after something has
been said about name, a new statement is

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

made about speech, which is something different from name (i. e. the
text says, 'Speech is more than name'), and so on up to the statement
about vital air, each subsequent statement referring to something other
than the topic of the preceding one. We therefore conclude that the
bhûman also, the statement about which follows on the statement about
the vital air, is something other than the vital air. But--it may be
objected--we meet here neither with a question, such as, 'Is there
something more than vital air?' nor with an answer, such as, 'That and
that is more than vital air.' How, then, can it be said that the
information about the bhûman is given subsequently to the information
about the vital air?--Moreover, we see that the circumstance of being an
ativâdin, which is exclusively connected with the vital air, is referred
to in the subsequent passage (viz. 'But in reality he is an ativâdin who
makes a statement surpassing (the preceding statements) by means of the
True'). There is thus no information additional to the information about
the vital air.--To this objection we reply that it is impossible to
maintain that the passage last quoted merely continues the discussion of
the quality of being an ativâdin, as connected with the knowledge of the
vital air; since the clause, 'He who makes a statement surpassing, &c.
by means of the True,' states a specification.--But, the objector
resumes, this very statement of a specification may be explained as
referring to the vital air. If you ask how, we refer you to an analogous
case. If somebody says, 'This Agnihotrin speaks the truth,' the meaning
is not that the quality of being an Agnihotrin depends on speaking the
truth; that quality rather depends on the (regular performance of the)
agnihotra only, and speaking the truth is mentioned merely as a special
attribute of that special Agnihotrin. So our passage also ('But in
reality he is an ativâdin who makes a statement, &c. by means of the
True') does not intimate that the quality of being an ativâdin depends
on speaking the truth, but merely expresses that speaking the truth is a
special attribute of him who knows the vital air; while the quality of
being an ativâdin must be considered to depend on the knowledge of the
vital air.--This

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

objection we rebut by the remark that it involves an abandonment of the
direct meaning of the sacred text. For from the text, as it stands, we
understand that the quality of being an ativâdin depends on speaking the
truth; the sense being: An ativâdin is he who is an ativâdin by means of
the True. The passage does not in anyway contain a eulogisation of the
knowledge of the vital air. It could be connected with the latter only
on the ground of general subject-matter (prakara*n*a)  <span
id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_176.md); which would involve an abandonment of
the direct meaning of the text in favour of prakara*n*a  <span
id="fr_177"></span>[2](#fn_177.md).--Moreover, the particle but ('But in
reality he is,' &c.), whose purport is to separate (what follows) from
the subject-matter of what precedes, would not agree (with the prâ*n*a
explanation). The following passage also, 'But we must desire to know
the True' (VII, 16), which presupposes a new effort, shows that a new
topic is going to be entered upon.--For these reasons we have to
consider the statement about the ativâdin in the same light as we should
consider the remark--made in a conversation which previously had turned
on the praise of those who study one Veda--that he who studies the four
Vedas is a great Brâhma*n*a; a remark which we should understand to be
laudatory of persons different from those who study one Veda, i.e. of
those who study all the four Vedas. Nor is there any reason to assume
that a new topic can be introduced in the form of question and answer
only; for that the matter propounded forms a new topic is sufficiently
clear from the circumstance that no connexion can be established between
it and the preceding topic. The succession of topics in the chapter
under discussion is as follows: Nârada at first listens to the
instruction which Sanatkumâra gives him about various matters, the last
of which is Prâ*n*a, and then becomes silent. Thereupon Sanatkumâra
explains to him spontaneously (without being

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

asked) that the quality of being an ativâdin, if merely based on the
knowledge of the vital air--which knowledge has for its object an unreal
product,--is devoid of substance, and that he only is an ativâdin who is
such by means of the True. By the term 'the True' there is meant the
highest Brahman; for Brahman is the Real, and it is called the 'True' in
another scriptural passage also, viz. Taitt. Up. II, 1, 'The True,
knowledge, infinite is Brahman.' Nârada, thus enlightened, starts a new
line of enquiry ('Might I, Sir, become an ativâdin by the True?') and
Sanatkumâra then leads him, by a series of instrumental steps, beginning
with understanding, up to the knowledge of bhûman. We therefrom conclude
that the bhûman is that very True whose explanation had been promised in
addition to the (knowledge of the) vital air. We thus see that the
instruction about the bhûman is additional to the instruction about the
vital air, and bhûman must therefore mean the highest Self, which is
different from the vital air. With this interpretation the initial
statement, according to which the enquiry into the Self forms the
general subject-matter, agrees perfectly well. The assumption, on the
other hand (made by the pûrvapakshin), that by the Self we have here to
understand the vital air is indefensible. For, in the first place,
Self-hood does not belong to the vital air in any non-figurative sense.
In the second place, cessation of grief cannot take place apart from the
knowledge of the highest Self; for, as another scriptural passage
declares, 'There is no other path to go' (*S*vet. Up. VI, 15). Moreover,
after we have read at the outset, 'Do, Sir, lead me over to the other
side of grief' (*Kh*. Up. VII, 1, 3), we meet with the following
concluding words (VII, 26, 2), 'To him, after his faults had been rubbed
out, the venerable Sanatkumâra showed the other side of darkness.' The
term 'darkness' here denotes Nescience, the cause of grief, and so
on.--Moreover, if the instruction terminated with the vital air, it
would not be said of the latter that it rests on something else. But the
brâhma*n*a (*Kh*. Up. VII, 36, 1) does say, 'The vital air springs from
the Self.' Nor can it be objected against this last argument that the
concluding

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

part of the chapter may refer to the highest Self, while, all the same,
the bhûman (mentioned in an earlier part of the chapter) may be the
vital air. For, from the passage (VII, 24, 1), ('Sir, in what does the
bhûman rest? In its own greatness,' &c.), it appears that the bhûman
forms the continuous topic up to the end of the chapter.--The quality of
being the bhûman--which quality is plenitude--agrees, moreover, best
with the highest Self, which is the cause of everything.
