*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

31\. If it be said that (Brahman is devoid of powers) on account of the
absence of organs; (we reply that) this has been explained (before).

Let this be granted.--Scripture, however, declares the highest divinity
to be without (bodily) organs of action <span
id="fr_313"></span>[1](#fn_313); so, for instance, in the passage, 'It
is without eyes, without ears, without speech, without mind' (B*ri*. Up.
III, 8, 8). Being such, how should it be able to produce effects,
although it may be endowed with all powers? For we know (from mantras,
arthavâdas, &c.) that the gods and other intelligent beings, though
endowed with all powers, are capable of producing certain effects only
because they are furnished with bodily instruments of action. And,
moreover, how can the divinity, to whom the scriptural passage, 'No,
no,' denies all attributes, be endowed with all powers?

The appropriate reply to this question has been already given above. The
transcendent highest Brahman can be fathomed by means of Scripture only,
not by mere reasoning. Nor are we obliged to assume that the capacity of
one being is exactly like that which is observed in another. It has
likewise been explained above that although all qualities are denied of
Brahman we nevertheless may consider it to be endowed with powers, if we
assume in its nature an element of plurality, which is the mere figment
of Nescience. Moreover, a scriptural passage ('Grasping without hands,
hastening without feet, he sees without eyes, he hears without ears'
*S*ve. Up. III, 19) declares that Brahman

although devoid of bodily organs, possesses all possible capacities.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_313"></span>[355:1](sbe34170.htm#fr_313) The Sûtra is
concerned with the body only as far as it is an instrument; the case of
extraneous instruments having already been disposed of in Sûtra 24.
