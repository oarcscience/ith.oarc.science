4\. (Brahman can)not (be the cause of the world) on account of the
difference of character of that, (viz. the world); and its being such,
(i.e. different from Brahman) (we learn) from Scripture.

The objections, founded on Sm*ri*ti, against the doctrine of Brahman
being the efficient and the material cause of this world have been
refuted; we now proceed to refute those founded on Reasoning.--But (to
raise an objection at the outset) how is there room for objections
founded on Reasoning after the sense of the sacred texts has once been
settled? The sacred texts are certainly to be considered absolutely
authoritative with regard to Brahman as well as with regard to religious
duty (dharma),--(To this the pûrvapakshin replies), The analogy between
Brahman and dharma would hold good if the matter in hand were to be
known through the holy texts only, and could not be approached by the
other means of right knowledge also. In the case of religious duties,
i.e. things to be done, we indeed entirely depend on Scripture. But now
we are concerned with Brahman which is an accomplished existing thing,
and in the case of accomplished things there is room for other means of
right knowledge also, as, for instance, the case of earth and the other
elements shows. And just as in the case of several conflicting
scriptural passages we explain all of them in such a manner as to make
them accord with one, so *S*ruti, if in conflict with other means of
right knowledge, has to be bent so as to accord with the letter.
Moreover, Reasoning, which enables us to infer something not actually
perceived in consequence of its having a certain equality of attributes
with what is actually perceived, stands nearer to perception than
*S*ruti which conveys its sense by tradition merely. And the knowledge

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

of Brahman which discards Nescience and effects final release terminates
in a perception (viz. the intuition--sâkshâtkâra--of Brahman), and as
such must be assumed to have a seen result (not an unseen one like
dharma) <span id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_268.md). Moreover, the scriptural
passage, 'He is to be heard, to be thought,' enjoins thought in addition
to hearing, and thereby shows that Reasoning also is to be resorted to
with regard to Brahman. Hence an objection founded on Reasoning is set
forth, 'Not so, on account of the difference of nature of this
(effect)'--The Vedântic opinion that the intelligent Brahman is the
material cause of this world is untenable because the effect would in
that case be of an altogether different character from the cause. For
this world, which the Vedântin considers as the effect of Brahman, is
perceived to be non-intelligent and impure, consequently different in
character from Brahman; and Brahman again is declared by the sacred
texts to be of a character different from the world, viz. intelligent
and pure. But things of an altogether different character cannot stand
to each other in the relation of material cause and effect. Such
effects, for instance, as golden ornaments do not have earth for their
material cause, nor is

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

gold the material cause of earthen vessels; but effects of an earthy
nature originate from earth and effects of the nature of gold from gold.
In the same manner this world, which is non-intelligent and comprises
pleasure, pain, and dulness, can only be the effect of a cause itself
non-intelligent and made up of pleasure, pain, and dulness; but not of
Brahman which is of an altogether different character. The difference in
character of this world from Brahman must be understood to be due to its
impurity and its want of intelligence. It is impure because being itself
made up of pleasure, pain, and dulness, it is the cause of delight,
grief, despondency, &c., and because it comprises in itself abodes of
various character such as heaven, hell, and so on. It is devoid of
intelligence because it is observed to stand to the intelligent
principle in the relation of subserviency, being the instrument of its
activity. For the relation of subserviency of one thing to another is
not possible on the basis of equality; two lamps, for instance, cannot
be said to be subservient to each other (both being equally
luminous).--But, it will be said, an intelligent instrument also might
be subservient to the enjoying soul; just as an intelligent servant is
subservient to his master.--This analogy, we reply, does not hold good,
because in the case of servant and master also only the non-intelligent
element in the former is subservient to the intelligent master. For a
being endowed with intelligence subserves another intelligent being only
with the non-intelligent part belonging to it, viz. its internal organ,
sense organs, &c.; while in so far as it is intelligent itself it acts
neither for nor against any other being. For the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas are of
opinion that the intelligent beings (i.e. the souls) are incapable of
either taking in or giving out anything <span
id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_269.md), and are non-active. Hence that only
which is devoid of intelligence can be an instrument. Nor  <span
id="fr_270"></span>[2](#fn_270.md) is there anything

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

to show that things like pieces of wood and clods of earth are of an
intelligent nature; on the contrary, the dichotomy of all things which
exist into such as are intelligent and such as are non-intelligent is
well established. This world therefore cannot have its material cause in
Brahman from which it is altogether different in character.--Here
somebody might argue as follows. Scripture tells us that this world has
originated from an intelligent cause; therefore, starting from the
observation that the attributes of the cause survive in the effect, I
assume this whole world to be intelligent. The absence of manifestation
of intelligence (in this world) is to be ascribed to the particular
nature of the modification <span id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_271.md). Just
as undoubtedly intelligent beings do not manifest their intelligence in
certain states such as sleep, swoon, &c., so the intelligence of wood
and earth also is not manifest (although it exists). In consequence of
this difference produced by the manifestation and non-manifestation of
intelligence (in the case of men, animals, &c., on the one side, and
wood, stones, &c. on the other side), and in consequence of form,
colour, and the like being present in the one case and absent in the
other, nothing prevents the instruments of action (earth, wood, &c.)
from standing to the souls in the relation of a subordinate to a
superior thing, although in reality both are equally of an intelligent
nature. And just as such substances as flesh, broth, pap, and the like
may, owing to their individual differences, stand in the relation of
mutual subserviency, although fundamentally they are all of the same
nature, viz. mere modifications of earth, so it will be in the case
under discussion also, without there being done any violence to the
well-known distinction (of beings intelligent and
non-intelligent).--This reasoning--the pûrvapakshin replies--if valid
might remove to a certain extent that difference of character between

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahman and the
world which is due to the circumstance of the one being intelligent and
the other non-intelligent; there would, however, still remain that other
difference which results from the fact that the one is pure and the
other impure. But in reality the argumentation of the objector does not
even remove the first-named difference; as is declared in the latter
part of the Sûtra, 'And its being such we learn from Scripture.' For the
assumption of the intellectuality of the entire world--which is
supported neither by perception nor by inference, &c.--must be
considered as resting on Scripture only in so far as the latter speaks
of the world as having originated from an intelligent cause; but that
scriptural statement itself is contradicted by other texts which declare
the world to be 'of such a nature,' i.e. of a nature different from that
of its material cause. For the scriptural passage, 'It became that which
is knowledge and that which is devoid of knowledge' (Taitt. Up. II, 6),
which teaches that a certain class of beings is of a non-intelligent
nature intimates thereby that the non-intelligent world is different
from the intelligent Brahman.--But--somebody might again object--the
sacred texts themselves sometimes speak of the elements and the bodily
organs, which are generally considered to be devoid of intelligence, as
intelligent beings. The following passages, for instance, attribute
intelligence to the elements. 'The earth spoke;' 'The waters spoke'
(*S*at. Br. VI, 1, 3, 2; 4); and, again, 'Fire thought;' 'Water thought'
(*Kh*. Up. VI, 2, 3; 4). Other texts attribute intelligence to the
bodily organs, 'These prâ*n*as when quarrelling together as to who was
the best went to Brahman' (B*ri*. Up. VI, 1, 7); and, again, 'They said
to Speech: Do thou sing out for us' (B*ri*. Up. I, 3, 2).--To this
objection the pûrvapakshin replies in the following Sûtra.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[300:1](sbe34143.htm#fr_268.md) The cognition of
Brahman terminates in an act of anubhava; hence as it has been shown
that reasoning is more closely connected with anubhava than *S*ruti is,
we have the right to apply reasoning to *S*ruti.--Ânanda Giri comments
