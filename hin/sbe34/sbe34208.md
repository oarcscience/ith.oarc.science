whatever new points of view the Bauddha system is tested with reference
to its probability, it gives way on all sides, like the walls of a well
dug in sandy soil. It has, in fact, no foundation whatever to rest upon,
and hence the attempts to use it as a guide in the practical concerns of
life are mere folly.--Moreover, Buddha by propounding the three mutually
contradictory systems, teaching respectively the reality of the external
world, the reality of ideas only, and general nothingness, has himself
made it clear either that he was a man given to make incoherent
assertions, or else that hatred of all beings induced him to propound
absurd doctrines by accepting which they would become thoroughly
confused.--So that--and this the Sûtra means to indicate--Buddha's
doctrine has to be entirely disregarded by all those who have a regard
for their own happiness.
