*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

32\. And (the devas, &c. are not qualified) on account of (the words
denoting the devas, &c.) being (used) in the sense of (sphere of) light.

To that sphere of light, the pûrvapakshin resumes, which is stationed in
the sky, and during its diurnal revolutions illumines the world, terms
such as Âditya, i.e. the names of devas, are applied, as we know from
the use of ordinary language, and from Vedic complementary
passages <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_211.md). But of a mere sphere of
light we cannot understand how it should be endowed with either a bodily
form, consisting of the heart and the like, or intelligence, or the
capability of forming wishes <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_212.md). For
mere light we know to be, like earth, entirely devoid of intelligence.
The same observation applies to Agni (fire), and so on. It will perhaps
be said that our objection is not valid, because the personality of the
devas is known from the mantras, arthavâdas, itihâsas, purâ*n*as, and
from the conceptions of ordinary life <span
id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_213.md); but we contest the relevancy of this
remark. For the conceptions of ordinary life do not constitute an
independent means of knowledge; we rather say that a thing is known from
ordinary life if it is known by the (acknowledged) means of knowledge,
perception, &c. But none of the recognised means of knowledge, such as
perception and the like, apply to the

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

matter under discussion. Itihâsas and purâ*n*as again being of human
origin, stand themselves in need of other means of knowledge on which to
base. The arthavâda passages also, which, as forming syntactical wholes
with the injunctory passages, have merely the purpose of glorifying
(what is enjoined in the latter), cannot be considered to constitute by
themselves reasons for the existence of the personality, &c. of the
devas. The mantras again, which, on the ground of direct enunciation,
&c., are to be employed (at the different stages of the sacrificial
action), have merely the purpose of denoting things connected with the
sacrificial performance, and do not constitute an independent means of
authoritative knowledge for anything <span
id="fr_214"></span>[1](#fn_214.md).--For these reasons the devas, and
similar beings, are not qualified for the knowledge of Brahman.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_211"></span>[217:1](sbe34101.htm#fr_211.md) As, for instance,
'So long as Âditya rises in the east and sets in the west' (*Kh*. Up.
III, 6, 4).

<span id="fn_212"></span>[217:2](sbe34101.htm#fr_212.md) Whence it follows
that the devas are not personal beings, and therefore not qualified for
the knowledge of Brahman.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[217:3](sbe34101.htm#fr_213.md) Yama, for
instance, being ordinarily represented as a person with a staff in his
hand, Varu*n*a with a noose, Indra with a thunderbolt, &c. &c.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[218:1](sbe34101.htm#fr_214.md) On the proper
function of arthavâda and mantra according to the Mîmâ*m*sâ, cp.
Arthasa*m*graha, Introduction.
