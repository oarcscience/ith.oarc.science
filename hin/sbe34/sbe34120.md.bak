*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

9\. But the (elements) beginning with light (are meant by the term
a*g*â); for some read so in their text.

By the term a*g*â we have to understand the causal matter of the four
classes of beings, which matter has sprung from the highest Lord and
begins with light, i.e. comprises fire, water, and earth.--The word
'but' (in the Sûtra) gives emphasis to the assertion.--This a*g*â is to
be considered as comprising three elementary substances, not as
consisting of three gu*n*as in the Sâ<u>n</u>khya sense. We draw this
conclusion from the fact that one *s*âkhâ, after having related how
fire, water, and earth sprang from the highest Lord, assigns to them red
colour, and so on. 'The red colour of burning fire

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (agni) is the
colour of the elementary fire (te*g*as), its white colour is the colour
of water, its black colour the colour of earth,' &c. Now those three
elements--fire, water, and earth--we recognise in the *S*vetâ*s*vatara
passage, as the words red, white, and black are common to both passages,
and as these words primarily denote special colours and can be applied
to the Sâ<u>n</u>khya gu*n*as in a secondary sense only. That passages
whose sense is beyond doubt are to be used for the interpretation of
doubtful passages, is a generally acknowledged rule. As we therefore
find that in the *S*vetâ*s*vatara--after the general topic has been
started in I, 1, 'The Brahman-students say, Is Brahman the cause?'--the
text, previous to the passage under discussion, speaks of a power of the
highest Lord which arranges the whole world ('the Sages devoted to
meditation and concentration have seen the power belonging to God
himself, hidden in its own qualities'); and as further that same power
is referred to in two subsequent complementary passages ('Know then,
Prak*ri*ti is Mâyâ, and the great Lord he who is affected with Mâyâ;'
'who being one only rules over every germ;' IV, 10, 11); it cannot
possibly be asserted that the mantra treating of the a*g*â refers to
some independent causal matter called pradhâna. We rather assert, on the
ground of the general subject-matter, that the mantra describes the same
divine power referred to in the other passages, in which names and forms
lie unevolved, and which we assume as the antecedent condition of that
state of the world in which names and forms are evolved. And that divine
power is represented as three-coloured, because its products, viz. fire,
water, and earth, have three distinct colours.--But how can we maintain,
on the ground of fire, water, and earth having three colours, that the
causal matter is appropriately called a three-coloured a*g*â? if we
consider, on the one hand, that the exterior form of the genus a*g*â
(i.e. goat) does not inhere in fire, water, and earth; and, on the other
hand, that Scripture teaches fire, water, and earth to have been
produced, so that the word a*g*â cannot be taken in the sense
'non-produced <span id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_238.md).'--To this question
the next Sûtra replies.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[255:1](sbe34120.htm#fr_238.md) Here there seems
to be a certain discrepancy between the <span id="page_256">p.
256</span> views of the Sûtra writer and *S*a<u>n</u>kara. Govindânanda
notes that according to the Bhâshyak*ri*t a*g*â means simply mâyâ--which
interpretation is based on prakara*n*a--while, according to the
Sûtra-k*ri*t, who explains a*g*â on the ground of the
*Kh*ândogya-passage treating of the three primary elements, a*g*â
denotes the aggregate of those three elements constituting an
avântaraprak*ri*ti.--On *S*a<u>n</u>kara's explanation the term a*g*â
presents no difficulties, for mâyâ is a*g*â, i.e. unborn, not produced.
On the explanation of the Sûtra writer, however, a*g*â cannot mean
unborn, since the three primary elements are products. Hence we are
thrown back on the rû*dh*i signification of a*g*â, according to which it
means she-goat. But how can the avântara-prak*ri*ti be called a
she-goat? To this question the next Sûtra replies.
