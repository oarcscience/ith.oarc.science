36\. (The beginninglessness of the world; recommends itself to reason
and is seen (from Scripture).

The beginninglessness of the world recommends itself to reason. For if
it had a beginning it would follow that, the world springing into
existence without a cause, the released souls also would again enter
into the circle of transmigratory existence; and further, as then there
would exist no determining cause of the unequal dispensation of pleasure
and pain, we should have to acquire in the doctrine of rewards and
punishments being allotted, without reference to previous good or bad
action. That the Lord is not the cause of the inequality, has already
been remarked. Nor can Nescience by itself be the cause, and it is of a
uniform nature. On the other hand, Nescience may be the cause of
inequality, if it be considered as having regard to merit accruing from
action produced by the mental impressions or wrath, hatred, and other
afflicting passions <span id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_317.md). Without merit
and demerit nobody can enter into existence, and again, without a body
merit and demerit cannot be formed; so that--on the doctrine

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

of the world having a beginning-we are led into a logical see-saw. The
opposite doctrine, on the other hand, explains all matters in a manner
analogous to the case of the seed and sprout, so that no difficulty
remains.--Moreover, the fact of the world being without a beginning, is
seen in *S*ruti and Sm*ri*ti. In the first place, we have the scriptural
passage, 'Let me enter with this living Self (*g*îva), &c. (*Kh*. Up.
VI, 3, 2). Here the circumstance of the embodied Self (the individual
soul) being called, previously to creation, 'the living Self'--a name
applying to it in so far as it is the sustaining principle of the
prâ*n*as--shows that this phenomenal world is without a beginning. For
if it had a beginning, the prâ*n*as would not exist before that
beginning, and how then could the embodied Self be denoted, with
reference to the time of the world's beginning, by a name which depends
on the existence of those prâ*n*as. Nor can it be said that it is so
designated with a view to its future relation to the prâ*n*as; it being
a settled principle that a past relation, as being already existing, is
of greater force than a mere future relation.--Moreover, we have the
mantra, 'As the creator formerly devised (akalpayat) sun and moon (*Ri.*
Sa*m*h. X, 190, 3), which intimates the existence of former Kalpas.
Sm*ri*ti also declares the world to be without a beginning, 'Neither its
form is known here, nor its end, nor its beginning, nor its support'
(Bha. Gî. XV, 3). And the Purâ*n*a also declares that there is no
measure of the past and the future Kalpas.
