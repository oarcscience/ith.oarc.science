being the universal light).

Moreover that aspect of the prâ*gñ*a Self is spoken of in Sm*ri*ti also,

nor the fire illumines that; having gone into which men do not return,
that is my highest seat.' And 'The light which abiding in the sun
illumines the whole world, and that which is in the moon and that which
is in the fire, all that light know to be mine.'
