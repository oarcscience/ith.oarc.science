others (i.e. the effects of the pradhâna, according to the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya system).

The principles different from the pradhâna, but to be viewed as its
modifications which the (Sâ<u>n</u>khya) Sm*ri*ti assumes, as, for
instance, the great principle, are perceived neither in the Veda nor in
ordinary experience. Now things of the nature of the elements and the
sense organs, which are well known from the Veda, as well as from
experience, may be referred to in Sm*ri*ti; but with regard to things
which, like Kapila's great principle, are known neither from the Veda
nor from experience--no more than, for instance, the objects of a sixth
sense--Sm*ri*ti is altogether impossible. That some scriptural passages
which apparently refer to such things as the great principle have in
reality quite a different meaning has already been shown under I, 4, 1.
But if that part of Sm*ri*ti which is concerned with the effects (i.e.
the great principle, and so on) is without authority, the part which
refers to the cause (the pradhâna) will be so likewise. This is what the
Sûtra means to say.--We have thus established a second reason, proving
that the circumstance of there being no room left for certain Sm*ri*tis
does not constitute a valid objection to our doctrine.--The weakness of
the trust in reasoning (apparently favouring the Sâ<u>n</u>khya
doctrine) will be shown later on under II, 1, 4 ff.
