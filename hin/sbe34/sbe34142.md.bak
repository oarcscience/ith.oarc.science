*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George

3\. Thereby the Yoga (Sm*ri*ti) is refuted.

This Sûtra extends the application of the preceding argumentation, and
remarks that by the refutation of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sm*ri*ti the
Yoga-sm*ri*ti also is to be considered as refuted; for the latter also
assumes, in opposition to Scripture, a pradhâna as the independent cause
of the world, and the 'great principle,' &c. as its effects, although
neither the Veda nor common experience favour these views.--But, if the
same reasoning applies to the Yoga also, the latter system is already
disposed of by the previous arguments; of what use then is it formally
to extend them to the Yoga? (as the Sûtra does.)--We reply that here an
additional

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

cause of doubt presents itself, the practice of Yoga being enjoined in
the Veda as a means of obtaining perfect knowledge; so, for instance,
B*ri*. Up. II, 4, 5, '(The Self) is to be heard, to be thought, to be
meditated upon <span id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_264.md).' In the
*S*vetâ*s*vatara Upanishad, moreover, we find various injunctions of
Yoga-practice connected with the assumption of different positions of
the body; &c.; so, for instance, 'Holding his body with its three erect
parts even,' &c. (II, 8).

Further, we find very many passages in the Veda which (without expressly
enjoining it) point to the Yoga, as, for instance, Ka. Up. II, 6, 11,
'This, the firm holding back of the senses, is what is called Yoga;'
'Having received this knowledge and the whole rule of Yoga' (Ka. Up. II,
6, 18); and so on. And in the Yoga-*s*âstra itself the passage, 'Now
then Yoga, the means of the knowledge of truth,' &c. defines the Yoga as
a means of reaching perfect knowledge. As thus one topic of the *s*âstra
at least (viz. the practice of Yoga) is shown to be authoritative, the
entire Yoga-sm*ri*ti will have to be accepted as unobjectionable, just
as the Sm*ri*ti referring to the ash*t*akâs <span
id="fr_265"></span>[2](#fn_265.md).--To this we reply that the formal
extension (to the Yoga, of the arguments primarily directed against the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya) has the purpose of removing the additional doubt stated
in the above lines; for in spite of a part of the Yoga-sm*ri*ti being
authoritative, the disagreement (between Sm*ri*ti and *S*ruti) on other
topics remains as shown above.--Although <span
id="fr_266"></span>[3](#fn_266.md) there are many Sm*ri*tis treating of the
soul, we have singled out for refutation the Sâ<u>n</u>khya and Yoga
because they are widely known as offering the means for accomplishing
the highest

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

end of man and have found favour with many competent persons. Moreover,
their position is strengthened by a Vedic passage referring to them, 'He
who has known that cause which is to be apprehended by Sâ<u>n</u>khya
and Yoga he is freed from all fetters' (*S*ve. Up. VI, 13). (The claims
which on the ground of this last passage might be set up for the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya and Yoga-sm*ri*tis in their entirety) we refute by the
remark that the highest beatitude (the highest aim of man) is not to be
attained by the knowledge of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sm*ri*ti irrespective of
the Veda, nor by the road of Yoga-practice. For Scripture itself
declares that there is no other means of obtaining the highest beatitude
but the knowledge of the unity of the Self which is conveyed by the
Veda, 'Over death passes only the man who knows him; there is no other
path to go' (*S*ve. Up. Ill, 8). And the Sâ<u>n</u>khya and Yoga-systems
maintain duality, do not discern the unity of the Self. In the passage
quoted ('That cause which is to be apprehended by Sâ<u>n</u>khya and
Yoga') the terms 'Sâ<u>n</u>khya' and 'Yoga' denote Vedic knowledge and
meditation, as we infer from proximity <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_267.md). We willingly allow room for those
portions of the two systems which do not contradict the Veda. In their
description of the soul, for instance, as free from all qualities the
Sâ<u>n</u>khyas are in harmony with the Veda which teaches that the
person (purusha) is essentially pure; cp. B*ri*. Up. IV, 3, 16. 'For
that person is not attached to anything.' The Yoga again in giving rules
for the condition of the wandering religious mendicant admits that state
of retirement from the concerns of life which is known from scriptural
passages such as the following one, 'Then the parivrâ*g*aka with
discoloured (yellow) dress, shaven, without any possessions,' &c.
(*G*âbâla Upan. IV).

The above remarks will serve as a reply to the claims of all
argumentative Sm*ri*tis. If it be said that those Sm*ri*tis also assist,
by argumentation and proof, the cognition of truth, we do not object to
so much, but we maintain

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

all the same that the truth can be known from the Vedânta-texts only; as
is stated by scriptural passages such as 'None who does not know the
Veda perceives that great one' (Taitt. Br. III, 12, 9, 7); 'I now ask
thee that person taught in the Upanishads' (B*ri*. Up, III, 9, 26); and
others.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_264"></span>[297:1](sbe34142.htm#fr_264.md) In which passage
the phrase 'to be meditated upon' (nididhyâsâ) indicates the act of
mental concentration characteristic of the Yoga.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[297:2](sbe34142.htm#fr_265.md) The ash*t*akâs
(certain oblations to be made on the eighth days after the full moons of
the seasons hemanta and *s*i*s*ira) furnish the stock illustration for
the doctrine of the Pûrvâ Mim. that Sm*ri*ti is authoritative in so far
as it is based on *S*ruti.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[297:3](sbe34142.htm#fr_266.md) But why--it will
be asked--do you apply yourself to the refutation of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya
and Yoga only, and not also to that of other Sm*ri*tis conflicting with
the Vedânta views?

<span id="fn_267"></span>[298:1](sbe34142.htm#fr_267.md) I. e. from the
fact of these terms being employed in a passage standing close to other
passages which refer to Vedic knowledge.
