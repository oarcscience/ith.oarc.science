20\. And as in the case of the different vital airs.

It is a matter of observation that when the operations of the different
kinds of vital air--such as prâ*n*a the ascending vital air, apâna the
descending vital air, &c.--are suspended, in consequence of the breath
being held so that they exist in their causes merely, the only effect
which continues to be accomplished is life, while all other effects,
such as the bending and stretching of the limbs and so on, are stopped.
When, thereupon, the vital airs again begin to act, those other effects
also are brought about, in addition to mere life.--Nor must the vital
airs, on account of their being divided into classes, be considered as
something else than vital air; for wind (air) constitutes their common
character. Thus (i. e. in the manner illustrated by the instance of the
vital airs) the non-difference of the effect from the cause is to be
conceived.--As, therefore, the whole world is an effect of Brahman and

that 'What is not heard is heard, what is not perceived is perceived,

been shown that cause and effect are identical; hence if the cause is
known, the effect is known also.
