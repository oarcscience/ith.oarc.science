13\. And because in consequence of samavâya being admitted a regressus
in infinitum results from parity of reasoning.

You (the Vai*s*eshika) admit that a binary compound which originates
from two atoms, while absolutely different from them, is connected with
them by the relation of inherence; but on that assumption the doctrine
of the atoms being the general cause cannot be established, 'because
parity involves here a retrogressus ad infinitum.' For just as a binary
compound which is absolutely different from the two constituent atoms is
connected with them by means of the relation of inherence (samavâya), so
the relation of inherence itself being absolutely different from the two
things which it connects, requires another relation of inherence to
connect it with them, there being absolute difference in both cases. For
this second relation of inherence again, a third relation of inherence
would have to be assumed and so on ad infinitum.--But--the Vai*s*eshika
is supposed to reply--we are conscious of the so-called samavâya
relation as eternally connected with the things between which it exists,
not as

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

either non-connected with them or as depending on another connexion; we
are therefore not obliged to assume another connexion, and again
another, and so on, and thus to allow ourselves to be driven into a
regressus in infinitum.--Your defence is unavailing, we reply, for it
would involve the admission that conjunction (sa*m*yoga) also as being
eternally connected with the things which it joins does, like samavâya,
not require another connexion  <span id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_368.md). If
you say that conjunction does require another connexion because it is a
different thing  <span id="fr_369"></span>[2](#fn_369.md) we reply that
then samavâya also requires another connexion because it is likewise a
different thing. Nor can you say that conjunction does require another
connexion because it is a quality (gu*n*a), and samavâya does not
because it is not a quality; for (in spite of this difference) the
reason for another connexion being required is the same in both cases
 <span id="fr_370"></span>[3](#fn_370.md), and not that which is
technically called 'quality' is the cause (of another connexion being
required)  <span id="fr_371"></span>[4](#fn_371.md).--For these reasons
those who acknowledge samavâya to be a separate existence are driven
into a regressus in infinitum, in consequence of which, the
impossibility of one term involving the impossibility of the entire
series, not even the origination of a binary compound from two atoms can
be accounted for.--For this reason also the atomic doctrine is
inadmissible.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_368"></span>[390:1](sbe34189.htm#fr_368.md) Which is
inadmissible on Vai*s*eshika principles, because sa*m*yoga as being a
quality is connected with the things it joins by samavâya.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[390:2](sbe34189.htm#fr_369.md) Viz. from those
things which are united by conjunction. The argument is that conjunction
as an independent third entity requires another connexion to connect it
with the two things related to each other in the way of conjunction.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[390:3](sbe34189.htm#fr_370.md) Viz. the absolute
difference of samavâya and sa*m*yoga from the terms which they connect.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[390:4](sbe34189.htm#fr_371) Action (karman.md),
&c. also standing in the samavâya relation to their substrates.
