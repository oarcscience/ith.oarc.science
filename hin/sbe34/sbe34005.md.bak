# THIRD ADHYÂYA.

### PÂDA I.

Adhik. I (1-7) teaches that the soul, when passing out of the body at
the time of death, remains invested with the subtle material elements
(bhûtasûkshma) which serve as an abode to the prâ*n*as attached to the
soul.

Adhik. II (8-11) shows that, when the souls of those who had enjoyed the
reward of their good works in the moon descend to the earth in order to
undergo a new embodiment, there cleaves to them a remainder (anu*s*aya)
of their

<span id="page_lx">p. lx</span>

former deeds which determines the nature of the new embodiment.

Adhik. III (12-21) discusses the fate after death of those whom their
good works do not entitle to pass up to the moon.

Adhik. IV, V, VI (22; 23; 24-27) teach that the subtle bodies of the
souls descending from the moon through the ether, air, &c., do not
become identical with ether, air, &c., but only like them; that the
entire descent occupies a short time only; and that, when the souls
finally enter into plants and so on, they do not participate in the life
of the latter, but are merely in external contact with them.

### PÂDA II.

Adhik. I (1-6) treats of the soul in the dreaming state. According to
*S*a<u>n</u>kara the three first Sûtras discuss the question whether the
creative activity ascribed to the soul in some scriptural passages
produces things as real as those by which the waking soul is surrounded,
or not; Sûtra 3 settles the point by declaring that the creations of the
dreaming soul are mere 'Mâyâ,' since they do not fully manifest the
character of real objects. Sûtra 4 adds that dreams, although mere Mâyâ,
yet have a prophetic quality. Sûtras 5 and 6 finally reply to the
question why the soul, which after all is a part of the Lord and as such
participates in his excellencies, should not be able to produce in its
dreams a real creation, by the remark that the soul's knowledge and
power are obscured by its connexion with the gross body.

The considerably diverging interpretation given of this adhikara*n*a by
Râmânu*g*a has the advantage of more closely connecting the Sûtras with
each other. According to him the question is not whether the creations
of a dream are real or not, but whether they are the work of the
individual soul or of the Lord acting within the soul. Sûtras 1 and 2
set forth the pûrvapaksha. The creations of dreams (are the work of the
individual soul); for thus Scripture declares: 'And the followers of
some *s*âkâs declare (the

<span id="page_lxi">p. lxi</span>

soul to be) a creator,' &c. The third Sûtra states the siddhânta view:
'But the creations of dreams are Mâyâ, i. e. are of a wonderful nature
(and as such cannot be effected by the individual soul), since (in this
life) the nature (of the soul) is not fully manifested.' Concerning the
word 'mâyâ,' Râmânu*g*a remarks, 'mâyâ*s*abdo hy â*sk*aryavâ*k*î
*g*anaka*s*ya kule *g*âtâ devamâyeva nirmitâ ityâdishu tathâ
dar*s*anât.' The three remaining Sûtras are exhibited in the
*S*rî-bhâshya in a different order, the fourth Sûtra, according to
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, being the sixth according to Râmânu*g*a. Sûtras 4 and
5 (according to Râmânu*g*a's numeration) are explained by Râmânu*g*a
very much in the same way as by *S*a<u>n</u>kara; but owing to the
former's statement of the subject-matter of the whole adhikara*n*a they
connect themselves more intimately with the preceding Sûtras than is
possible on *S*a<u>n</u>kara's interpretation. In Sûtra 6 (sû*k*aka*s*
*k*â hi) Râmânu*g*a sees a deduction from the siddhânta of the
adhikara*n*a, 'Because the images of a dream are produced by the highest
Lord himself, therefore they have prophetic significance.'

Adhik. II teaches that in the state of deep dreamless sleep the soul
abides within Brahman in the heart.

Adhik. III (9) expounds the reasons entitling us to assume that the soul
awakening from sleep is the same that went to sleep.--Adhik. IV (9)
explains the nature of a swoon.

Adhik. V (11-21) is, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, taken up with the
question as to the nature of the highest Brahman in which the individual
soul is merged in the state of deep sleep. Sûtra 11 declares that
twofold characteristics (viz. absence and presence of distinctive
attributes, nirvi*s*eshatva and savi*s*eshatva) cannot belong to the
highest Brahman even through its stations, i.e. its limiting adjuncts;
since all passages which aim at setting forth Brahman's nature declare
it to be destitute of all distinctive attributes.--The fact, Sûtra 12
continues, that in many passages Brahman is spoken of as possessing
distinctive attributes is of no relevancy, since wherever there are
mentioned limiting adjuncts, on which all distinction depends, it is
specially stated

<span id="page_lxii">p. lxii</span>

that Brahman in itself is free from all diversity; and--Sûtra 13
adds--in some places the assumption of diversity is specially objected
to.--That Brahman is devoid of all form (Sûtra 14), is the pre-eminent
meaning of all Vedânta-texts setting forth Brahman's nature.--That
Brahman is represented as having different forms, as it were, is due to
its connexion with its (unreal) limiting adjuncts; just as the light of
the sun appears straight or crooked, as it were, according to the nature
of the things he illuminates (15).--The B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka expressly
declares that Brahman is one uniform mass of intelligence (16); and the
same is taught in other scriptural passages and in Sm*ri*ti (17).--At
the unreality of the apparent manifoldness of the Self, caused by the
limiting adjuncts, aim those scriptural passages in which the Self is
compared to the sun, which remains one although his reflections on the
surface of the water are many (18).--Nor must the objection be raised
that that comparison is unsuitable, because the Self is not material
like the sun, and there are no real upâdhis separate from it as the
water is from the sun; for the comparison merely means to indicate that,
as the reflected image of the sun participates in the changes, increase,
decrease, &c., which the water undergoes while the sun himself remains
unaffected thereby, so the true Self is not affected by the attributes
of the upâdhis, while, in so far as it is limited by the latter, it is
affected by them as it were (19, 20).--That the Self is within the
upâdhis, Scripture declares (21).

From the above explanation of this important adhikara*n*a the one given
in the Srî-bhâshya differs totally. According to Râmânu*g*a the
adhikara*n*a raises the question whether the imperfections clinging to
the individual soul (the discussion of which has now come to an end)
affect also the highest Lord who, according to Scripture, abides within
the soul as antaryâmin. 'Notwithstanding the abode (of the highest Self
within the soul) (it is) not (affected by the soul's imperfections)
because everywhere (the highest Self is represented) as having twofold
characteristics (viz. being, on one hand, free from all evil,
apahatapâpman, vi*g*ara, vim*ri*tyu, &c., and, on the other hand,
endowed with all auspicious

<span id="page_lxiii">p. lxiii</span>

qualities, satyakâma, satyasa*m*kalpa, &c.) (11).--Should it be objected
that, just as the soul although essentially free from evil--according to
the Pra*g*âpativâkya in the *Kh*andogya--yet is liable to imperfections
owing to its connexion with a variety of bodies, so the antaryâmin also
is affected by abiding within bodies; we deny this because in every
section of the chapter referring to the antaryâmin (in the
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka) he is expressly called the Immortal, the ruler
within; which shows him to be free from the shortcomings of the *g*iva
(12).--Some, moreover, expressly assert that, although the Lord and the
soul are within one body, the soul only is imperfect, not the Lord (dvâ
supar*n*â sayu*g*â sakhâyâ) (13).--Should it be said that, according to
the *Kh*ândogya, Brahman entered together with the souls into the
elements previously to the evolution of names and forms, and hence
participates in the latter, thus becoming implicated in the sa*m*sâra;
we reply that Brahman, although connected with such and such forms, is
in itself devoid of form, since it is the principal element (agent;
pradhâna) in the bringing about of names and forms (according to
'âkâ*s*o ha vai nâmarûpayor nirvahitâ') (14).--But does not the passage
'satya*m* *gñ*ânam anantam brahma' teach that Brahman is nothing but
light (intelligence) without any difference, and does not the passage
'neti neti' deny of it all qualities?--As in order, we reply, not to
deprive passages as the one quoted from the Taittirîya of their purport,
we admit that Brahman's nature is light, so we must also admit that
Brahman is satyasa*m*kalpa, and so on; for if not, the passages in which
those qualities are asserted would become purportless (15).--Moreover
the Taittirîya passage only asserts so much, viz. the prakâ*s*arûpatâ of
Brahman, and does not deny other qualities (16).--And the passage 'neti
neti' will be discussed later on.--The ubhayali<u>n</u>gatva of Brahman
in the sense assigned above is asserted in many places *S*ruti and
Sm*ri*ti (17).--Because Brahman although abiding in many places is not
touched by their imperfections, the similes of the reflected sun, of the
ether limited by jars, &c., are applicable to it (18).--Should it be
said that the illustration is not an appropriate one, because the

<span id="page_lxiv">p. lxiv</span>

sun is apprehended in the water erroneously only while the antaryâmin
really abides within all things, and therefore must be viewed as sharing
their defects (19); we reply that what the simile means to negative is
merely that Brahman should, owing to its inherence in many places,
participate in the increase, decrease, and so on, of its abodes. On this
view both similes are appropriate (20).--Analogous similes we observe to
be employed in ordinary life, as when we compare a man to a lion (21).

Sutras 22-30 constitute, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, a new
adhikara*n*a (VI), whose object it is to show that the clause 'not so,
not so' (neti neti; B*ri*hadâr.) negatives, not Brahman itself, but only
the two forms of Brahman described in the preceding part of the chapter.
Sutras 23-26 further dwell on Brahman being in reality devoid of all
distinctive attributes which are altogether due to the upâdhis. The last
four Sutras return to the question how, Brahman being one only, the
souls are in so many places spoken of as different from it, and, two
explanatory hypotheses having been rejected, the conclusion is arrived
at that all difference is unreal, due to fictitious limiting adjuncts.

According to Râmânu*g*a, Sûtras 22 ff. continue the discussion started
in Sûtra 11. How, the question is asked, can the ubhayali<u>n</u>gatva
of Brahman be maintained considering that the 'not so, not so' of the
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka denies of Brahman all the previously mentioned modes
(prakâra), so that it can only be called that which is (sanmâtra)?--The
reply given in Sutra 22 is that 'not so, not so' does not deny of
Brahman the distinctive qualities or modes declared previously (for it
would be senseless at first to teach them, and finally to deny them
again <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20).md), but merely denies the
prâk*ri*taitâvattva, the previously stated limited nature of Brahman,
i.e. it denies that Brahman possesses only the previously mentioned
qualifications. With this agrees, that subsequently to 'neti neti'
Scripture itself enunciates further qualifications of Brahman. That
Brahman as stated

<span id="page_lxv">p. lxv</span>

above is not the object of any other means of proof but Scripture is
confirmed in Sutra 23, 'Scripture declares Brahman to be the
non-manifest.'--And the intuition (sâkshâtkâra) of Brahman ensues only
upon its sa*m*râdhana, i.e. upon its being perfectly pleased by the
worshipper's devotion, as Scripture and Sm*ri*ti declare (24).--That
this interpretation of 'neti' is the right one, is likewise shown by the
fact that in the same way as prakâ*s*a, luminousness, *gñ*âna,
intelligence, &c., so also the quality of being differentiated by the
world (prapa*ñk*avsish*t*atâ) is intuited as non-different, i.e. as
likewise qualifying Brahman; and that prakâ*s*a, and so on, characterise
Brahman, is known through repeated practice (on the part of *ri*shis
like Vâmadeva) in the work of sa*m*râdhana mentioned before (25).--For
all these reasons Brahman is connected with the infinite, i.e. the
infinite number of auspicious qualities; for thus the twofold
indications (li<u>n</u>ga) met with in Scripture are fully justified
(26).--In what relation, then, does the a*k*id vastu, i.e. the
non-sentient matter, which, according to the b*ri*hadara*n*yaka, is one
of the forms of Brahman, stand to the latter?--Non-sentient beings
might, in the first place, be viewed as special arrangements
(sa*m*sthanaviseshâ*h*) of Brahman, as the coils are of the body of the
snake; for Brahman is designated as both, i.e. sometimes as one with the
world (Brahman is all this, &c.), sometimes as different from it (Let me
enter into those elements, &c.) (27).--Or, in the second place, the
relation of the two might be viewed as analogous to that of light and
the luminous object which are two and yet one, both being fire
(28).--Or, in the third place, the relation is like that stated before,
i.e. the material world is, like the individual souls (whose case was
discussed in II, 3, 43), a part--a*ms*a--of Brahman (29, 30).

Adhik. VII (31-37) explains how some metaphorical expressions, seemingly
implying that there is something different from Brahman, have to be
truly understood.

Adhik. VIII (38-41) teaches that the reward of works is not, as
*G*aimini opines, the independent result of the works acting through the
so-called apûrva, but is allotted by the Lord.

<span id="page_lxvi">p. lxvi</span>

### PÂDA III.

With the third pâda of the second adhyâya a new section of the work
begins, whose task it is to describe how the individual soul is enabled
by meditation on Brahman to obtain final release. The first point to be
determined here is what constitutes a meditation on Brahman, and, more
particularly, in what relation those parts of the Upanishads stand to
each other which enjoin identical or partly identical meditations. The
reader of the Upanishads cannot fail to observe that the texts of the
different *s*âkhâs contain many chapters of similar, often nearly
identical, contents, and that in some cases the text of even one and the
same *s*âkhâ exhibits the same matter in more or less varied forms. The
reason of this clearly is that the common stock of religious and
philosophical ideas which were in circulation at the time of the
composition of the Upanishads found separate expression in the different
priestly communities; hence the same speculations, legends, &c. reappear
in various places of the sacred Scriptures in more or less differing
dress. Originally, when we may suppose the members of each Vedic school
to have confined themselves to the study of their own sacred texts, the
fact that the texts of other schools contained chapters of similar
contents would hardly appear to call for special note or comment; not
any more than the circumstance that the sacrificial performances
enjoined on the followers of some particular *s*âkhâ were found
described with greater or smaller modifications in the books of other
*s*âkhâs also. But already at a very early period, at any rate long
before the composition of the Vedânta-sûtras in their present form, the
Vedic theologians must have apprehended the truth that, in whatever
regards sacrificial acts, one *s*âkhâ may indeed safely follow its own
texts, disregarding the texts of all other *s*âkhâs; that, however, all
texts which aim at throwing light on the nature of Brahman and the
relation to it of the human soul must somehow or other be combined into
one consistent systematical whole equally valid for the followers of all
Vedic schools. For, as we have had occasion to remark above, while acts
may be performed

<span id="page_lxvii">p. lxvii</span>

by different individuals in different ways, cognition is defined by the
nature of the object cognised, and hence can be one only, unless it
ceases to be true cognition. Hence the attempts, on the one hand, of
discarding by skilful interpretation all contradictions met with in the
sacred text, and, on the other hand, of showing what sections of the
different Upanishads have to be viewed as teaching the same matter, and
therefore must be combined in one meditation. The latter is the special
task of the present pâda.

Adhik. I and II (1-4; 5) are concerned with the question whether those
vidyâs, which are met with in identical or similar form in more than one
sacred text, are to be considered as constituting several vidyâs, or one
vidyâ only. *S*a<u>n</u>kara remarks that the question affects only
those vidyâs whose object is the qualified Brahman; for the knowledge of
the non-qualified Brahman, which is of an absolutely uniform nature, can
of course be one only wherever it is set forth. But things lie
differently in those cases where the object of knowledge is the
sagu*n*am brahma or some outward manifestation of Brahman; for the
qualities as well as manifestations of Brahman are many. Anticipating
the subject of a later adhikara*n*a, we may take for an example the
so-called--*S*â*nd*ilyavidyâ which is met with in *Kh*. Up. III, 14,
again--in an abridged form--in B*ri*. Up. V, 6, and, moreover, in the
tenth book of the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a (X, 6, 3). The three passages
enjoin a meditation on Brahman as possessing certain attributes, some of
which are specified in all the three texts (as, for instance,
manomayatva, bhârûpatva), while others are peculiar to each separate
passage (prâ*n*a*s*arîratva and satyasa*m*kalpatva, for instance, being
mentioned in the *Kh*ândogya Upanishad and *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a, but
not in the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka Upanishad, which, on its part, specifies
sarvava*s*itva, not referred to in the two other texts). Here, then,
there is room for a doubt whether the three passages refer to one object
of knowledge or not. To the devout Vedântin the question is not a purely
theoretical one, but of immediate practical interest. For if the three
texts are to be held apart, there are three different meditations to be
gone through; if, on the

<span id="page_lxviii">p. lxviii</span>

other hand, the vidyâ is one only, all the different qualities of
Brahman mentioned in the three passages have to be combined into one
meditation.--The decision is here, as in all similar cases, in favour of
the latter alternative. A careful examination of the three passages
shows that the object of meditation is one only; hence the meditation
also is one only, comprehending all the attributes mentioned in the
three texts.

Adhik. III (6-8) discusses the case of vidyâs being really separate,
although apparently identical. The examples selected are the
udgîthavidyâs of the *Kh*ândogya Upanishad (I, 1-3) and the
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka Upanishad (I, 3), which, although showing certain
similarities--such as bearing the same name and the udgîtha being in
both identified with prâ*n*a--yet are to be held apart, because the
subject of the *Kh*ândogya vidyâ is not the whole udgîtha but only the
sacred syllabic Om, while the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka Upanishad represents
the whole udgîtha as the object of meditation.

Sûtra 9 constitutes in *S*a<u>n</u>kara's view a new adhikara*n*a (IV),
proving that in the passage, 'Let a man meditate' (*Kh*. Up. I, 1, 1),
the O*m*kâra and the udgîtha stand in the relation of one specifying the
other, the meaning being, 'Let a man meditate on that O*m*kâra which,'
&c.--According to Râmânu*g*a's interpretation, which seems to fall in
more satisfactorily with the form and the wording of the Sûtra, the
latter merely furnishes an additional argument for the conclusion
arrived at in the preceding adhikara*n*a.--Adhik. V (10) determines the
unity of the so-called prâ*n*a-vidyâs and the consequent comprehension
of the different qualities of the prâ*n*a, which are mentioned in the
different texts, within one meditation.

Adhik. VI comprises, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, the Sûtras 11-13.
The point to be settled is whether in all the meditations on Brahman all
its qualities are to be included or only those mentioned in the special
vidyâ. The decision is that the essential and unalterable attributes of
Brahman, such as bliss and knowledge, are to be taken into account
everywhere, while those which admit of a more or less (as, for instance,
the attribute of having joy for its head, mentioned

<span id="page_lxix">p. lxix</span>

in the Taitt. Up.) are confined to special meditations.--Adhik. VII (14,
15), according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, aims at proving that the object of
Ka*th*a. Up. III, 10, 11 is one only, viz. to show that the highest Self
is higher than everything, so that the passage constitutes one vidyâ
only.--Adhik. VIII (16, 17) determines, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara,
that the Self spoken of in Ait. Âr. II, 4, 1, 1 is not a lower form of
the Self (the so-called sûtrâtman), but the highest Self; the discussion
of that point in this place being due to the wish to prove that the
attributes of the highest Self have to be comprehended in the Aitareyaka
meditation.

According to Râmânu*g*a the Sûtras 11-17 constitute a single
adhikara*n*a whose subject is the same as that of *S*a<u>n</u>kara's
sixth adhikara*n*a. Sûtras 11-13 are, on the whole, explained as by
*S*a<u>n</u>kara; Sûtra 12, however, is said to mean, 'Such attributes
as having joy for its head, &c. are not to be viewed as qualities of
Brahman, and therefore not to be included in every meditation; for if
they were admitted as qualities, difference would be introduced into
Brahman's nature, and that would involve a more or less on Brahman's
part.' Sûtras 14-17 continue the discussion of the passage about the
priya*s*irastva.--If priya*s*irastva, &c. are not to be viewed as real
qualities of Brahman, for what purpose does the text mention
them?--'Because,' Sûtra 14 replies, 'there is no other purpose,
Scripture mentions them for the purpose of pious meditation.'--But how
is it known that the Self of delight is the highest Self? (owing to
which you maintain that having limbs, head, &c. cannot belong to it as
attributes.)--' Because,' Sûtra 15 replies, 'the term "Self" (âtmâ
ânandamaya) is applied to it.'--But in the previous parts of the chapter
the term Self (in âtmâ pra*n*amaya, &c.) is applied to non-Selfs also;
how then do you know that in âtmâ ânandamaya it denotes the real
Self?--'The term Self,' Sûtra 16 replies, 'is employed here to denote
the highest Self as in many other passages (âtmâ vâ idam eka, &c.), as
we conclude from the subsequent passage, viz. he wished, 'May I be
many.'--But, an objection is raised, does not the context show that the
term 'Self,' which in all the preceding

<span id="page_lxx">p. lxx</span>

clauses about the prâ*n*amaya, &c. denoted something other than the
Self, does the same in ânandamaya âtman, and is not the context of
greater weight than a subsequent passage?--To this question asked in the
former half of 17 (anvayâd iti *k*et) the latter half replies, 'Still it
denotes the Self, owing to the affirmatory statement,' i.e. the fact of
the highest Self having been affirmed in a previous passage also, viz.
II, 1, 'From that Self sprang ether.'

Adhik. IX (18) discusses a minor point connected with the
prâ*n*asa*m*vâda.--The subject of Adhik. X (19) has been indicated
already above under Adhik. I.--Adhik. XI (20-22) treats of a case of a
contrary nature; in B*ri*. Up. V, 5, Brahman is represented first as
abiding in the sphere of the sun, and then as abiding within the eye; we
therefore, in spite of certain counter-indications, have to do with two
separate vidyâs.--Adhik. XII (23) refers to a similar case; certain
attributes of Brahman mentioned in the Râ*n*âya-nîya-khila have not to
be introduced into the corresponding *Kh*ândogya vidyâ, because the
stated difference of Brahman's abode involves difference of
vidyâ.--Adhik. XIII (24) treats of another instance of two vidyâs having
to be held apart.

Adhik. XIV (25) decides that certain detached mantras and brâhma*n*a
passages met with in the beginning of some Upanishads--as, for instance,
a brâhma*n*a about the mahâvrata ceremony at the beginning of the
Aitareya-âra*n*yaka--do, notwithstanding their position which seems to
connect them with the brahmavidyâ, not belong to the latter, since they
show unmistakable signs of being connected with sacrificial acts.

Adhik. XV (26) treats of the passages stating that the man dying in the
possession of true knowledge shakes off all his good and evil deeds, and
affirms that a statement, made in some of those passages only, to the
effect that the good and evil deeds pass over to the friends and enemies
of the deceased, is valid for all the passages.

Sûtras 27-30 constitute, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, two
adhikara*n*as of which the former (XVI; 27, 28) decides that the shaking
off of the good and evil deeds takes place-not, as

<span id="page_lxxi">p. lxxi</span>

the Kaush. Up. states, on the road to Brahman's world--but at the moment
of the soul's departure from the body; the Kaushîtaki statement is
therefore not to be taken literally.--The latter adhikara*n*a (XVII; 29,
30) treats of the cognate question whether the soul that has freed
itself from its deeds proceeds in all cases on the road of the gods (as
said in the Kaush. Up.), or not. The decision is that he only whose
knowledge does not pass beyond the sagu*n*am brahma proceeds on that
road, while the soul of him who knows the nirgu*n*am brahma becomes one
with it without moving to any other place.

The *S*rî-bhâshya treats the four Sûtras as one adhikara*n*a whose two
first Sûtras are explained as by *S*a<u>n</u>kara, while Sûtra 29 raises
an objection to the conclusion arrived at, 'the going (of the soul on
the path of the gods) has a sense only if the soul's freeing itself from
its works takes place in both ways, i.e. partly at the moment of death,
partly on the road to Brahman; for otherwise there would be a
contradiction '(the contradiction being that, if the soul's works were
all shaken off at the moment of death, the subtle body would likewise
perish at that moment, and then the bodiless soul would be unable to
proceed on the path of the gods). To this Sûtra 30 replies, 'The
complete shaking off of the works at the moment of death is possible,
since matters of that kind are observed in Scripture,' i. e. since
scriptural passages show that even he whose works are entirely
annihilated, and who has manifested himself in his true shape, is yet
connected with some kind of body; compare the passage, 'para*m* *g*yotir
upasampadya svena rûpe*n*abhinishpadyate sa tatra paryeti krî*d*an
ramamâna*h* sa svarâ*d* bhavati tasya sarveshu lokeshu kâma*k*âro
bhavati.' That subtle body is not due to karman, but to the soul's
vidyâmâhâtmya.--That the explanation of the *S*rî-bhâshya agrees with
the text as well as *S*a<u>n</u>kara's, a comparison of the two will
show; especially forced is *S*a<u>n</u>kara's explanation of
'arthavattvam ubhayathâ,' which is said to mean that there is
arthavattva in one case, and non-arthavattva in the other case.

The next Sûtra (31) constitutes an adhikara*n*a (XVIII)

<span id="page_lxxii">p. lxxii</span>

deciding that the road of the gods is followed not only by those knowing
the vidyâs which specially mention the going on that road, but by all
who are acquainted with the sagu*n*a-vidyâs of Brahman.--The explanation
given in the *S*rî-bhâshya (in which Sutras 31 and 32 have exchanged
places) is similar, with the difference however that all who meditate on
Brahman--without any reference to the distinction of nirgu*n*a and
sagu*n*a--proceed after death on the road of the gods. (The
*S*rî-bhâshya reads 'sarveshâm,' i.e. all worshippers, not 'sarvâsâm,'
all sagu*n*a-vidyâs.)

Adhik. XIX (32) decides that, although the general effect of true
knowledge is release from all forms of body, yet even such beings as
have reached perfect knowledge may retain a body for the purpose of
discharging certain offices.--In the *S*rî-bhâshya, where the Sûtra
follows immediately on Sûtra 30, the adhikara*n*a determines, in close
connexion with 30, that, although those who know Brahman as a rule
divest themselves of the gross body--there remaining only a subtle body
which enables them to move--and no longer experience pleasure and pain,
yet certain beings, although having reached the cognition of Brahman,
remain invested with a gross body, and hence liable to pleasure and pain
until they have fully performed certain duties.

Adhik. XX (33) teaches that the negative attributes of Brahman mentioned
in some vidyâs--such as its being not gross, not subtle, &c.--are to be
included in all meditations on Brahman.--Adhik. XXI (34) determines that
Kâ*th*a Up. III, 1, and Mu. Up. III, 1, constitute one vidyâ only,
because both passages refer to the highest Brahman. According to
Râmânu*g*a the Sûtra contains a reply to an objection raised against the
conclusion arrived at in the preceding Sûtra.--Adhik. XXII (35, 36)
maintains that the two passages, B*ri*. Up. III, 4 and III, 5,
constitute one vidyâ only, the object of knowledge being in both cases
Brahman viewed as the inner Self of all.--Adhik. XXIII (37) on the
contrary decides that the passage Ait. Âr. II, 2, 4, 6 constitutes not
one but two meditations.--Adhik. XXIV (38) again determines that the
vidyâ of the True contained in B*ri*. Up. V, 4, 5, is one
only--According to Râmânu*g*a,

<span id="page_lxxiii">p. lxxiii</span>

Sûtras 35-38 constitute one adhikara*n*a only whose subject is the same
as that of XXII according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara.

Adhik. XXV (39) proves that the passages *Kh*. Up. VIII, 1 and B*ri*.
Up. IV, 4, 22 cannot constitute one vidyâ, since the former refers to
Brahman as possessing qualities, while the latter is concerned with
Brahman as destitute of qualities.--Adhik. XXVI (40, 41) treats,
according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, of a minor question connected with *Kh*.
Up. V, 11 ff.--According to the *S*rî-bhâshya, Sûtras 39-41 form one
adhikara*n*a whose first Sûtra reaches essentially the same conclusion
as *S*a<u>n</u>kara under 39. Sûtras 40, 41 thereupon discuss a general
question concerning the meditations on Brahman. The qualities, an
opponent is supposed to remark, which in the two passages discussed are
predicated of Brahman--such as va*s*itva, satyakâmatva, &c.--cannot be
considered real (pâramârthika), since other passages (sa esha neti neti,
and the like) declare Brahman to be devoid of all qualities. Hence those
qualities cannot be admitted into meditations whose purpose is final
release.--To this objection Sûtra 40 replies,'(Those qualities) are not
to be left off (from the meditations on Brahman), since (in the passage
under discussion as well as in other passages) they are stated with
emphasis <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md).'--But, another objection
is raised, Scripture says that he who meditates on Brahman as satyakâma,
&c. obtains a mere perishable reward, viz. the world of the fathers, and
similar results specified in *Kh*. Up. VIII, 2; hence, he who is
desirous of final release, must not include those qualities of Brahman
in his meditation.--To this objection Sûtra 41 replies, 'Because that
(i. e. the free roaming in all the worlds, the world of the fathers,
&c.) is stated as proceeding therefrom (i. e. the approach to Brahman
which is final release) in the case of (the soul) which has approached
Brahman;' (therefore a person desirous of release, may include
satyakâmatva, &c. in his meditations.)

<span id="page_lxxiv">p. lxxiv</span>

Adhik. XXVII (42) decides that those meditations which are connected
with certain matters forming constituent parts of sacrificial actions,
are not to be considered as permanently requisite parts of the
latter.--Adhik. XXVIII (43) teaches that, in a B*ri*. Up. passage and a
similar *Kh*. Up. passage, Vâyu and Prâ*n*a are not to be identified,
but to be held apart.--Adhik. XXIX (44-52) decides that the fire-altars
made of mind, &c., which are mentioned in the Agnirahasya, do not
constitute parts of the sacrificial action (so that the mental, &c.
construction of the altar could optionally be substituted for the actual
one), but merely subjects of meditations.

Adhik. XXX (53,54) treats, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, in the way of
digression, of the question whether to the Self an existence independent
of the body can be assigned, or not (as the Materialists
maintain).--According to the *S*rî-bhâshya the adhikara*n*a does not
refer to this wide question, but is concerned with a point more
immediately connected with the meditations on Brahman, viz. the question
as to the form under which, in those meditations, the Self of the
meditating devotee has to be viewed. The two Sûtras then have to be
translated as follows: 'Some (maintain that the soul of the devotee has,
in meditations, to be viewed as possessing those attributes only which
belong to it in its embodied state, such as *g*ñât*ri*tva and the like),
because the Self is (at the time of meditation) in the body.'--The next
Sûtra rejects this view, 'This is not so, but the separatedness (i. e.
the pure isolated state in which the Self is at the time of final
release when it is freed from all evil, &c.) (is to be transferred to
the meditating Self), because that will be <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) the state (of the Self in the condition of
final release).'

Adhik. XXXI (55, 56) decides that meditations connected with constituent
elements of the sacrifice, such as the udgîtha, are, in spite of
difference of svara in the udgîtha, &c., valid, not only for that
*s*âkhâ in which the meditation actually is met with, but for all
*s*âkhâs.--Adhik.

<span id="page_lxxv">p. lxxv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> XXXII (57) decides
that the Vai*s*vânara Agni of *Kh*. Up. V, II ff. is to be meditated
upon as a whole, not in his single parts.--Adhik. XXXIII (58) teaches
that those meditations which refer to one subject, but as distinguished
by different qualities, have to be held apart as different meditations.
Thus the daharavidyâ, *S*â*nd*ilyavidyâ, &c. remain separate.

Adhik. XXXIV (59) teaches that those meditations on Brahman for which
the texts assign one and the same fruit are optional, there being no
reason for their being cumulated.--Adhik. XXXV (60) decides that those
meditations, on the other hand, which refer to special wishes may be
cumulated or optionally employed according to choice.--Adhik. XXXVI
(61-66) extends this conclusion to the meditations connected with
constituent elements of action, such as the udgîtha.

### PÂDA IV.

Adhik. I (1-17) proves that the knowledge of Brahman is not kratvartha,
i.e. subordinate to action, but independent.--Adhik. II (18-20) confirms
this conclusion by showing that the state of the pravrâ*g*ins is
enjoined by the sacred law, and that for them vidyâ only is prescribed,
not action.--Adhik. III (21,22) decides that certain clauses forming
part of vidyâs are not mere stutis (arthavâdas), but themselves enjoin
the meditation.--The legends recorded in the Vedânta-texts are not to be
used as subordinate members of acts, but have the purpose of
glorifying--as arthavâdas--the injunctions with which they are connected
(Adhik. IV, 23, 24).--For all these reasons the ûrdhvaretasa*h* require
no actions but only knowledge (Adhik. V, 25).--Nevertheless the actions
enjoined by Scripture, such as sacrifices, conduct of certain kinds,
&c., are required as conducive to the rise of vidyâ in the mind (Adhik.
VI, 26, 27).--Certain relaxations, allowed by Scripture, of the laws
regarding food, are meant only for cases of extreme need (Adhik. VII,
28-3l).--The â*s*ramakarmâ*n*i are obligatory on him also who does not
strive after mukti (Adhik. VIII,

<span id="page_lxxvi">p. lxxvi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 32-35).--Those
also who, owing to poverty and so on, are anâ*s*rama have claims to
vidyâ (Adhik. IX, 36-39).--An ûrdhvaretas cannot revoke his vow (Adhik.
X, 40).--Expiation of the fall of an ûrdhvaretas (Adhik. XI, 41,
42).--Exclusion of the fallen ûrdhvaretas in certain cases (Adhik. XII,
43).--Those meditations, which are connected with subordinate members of
the sacrifice, are the business of the priest, not of the ya*g*amâna
(Adhik. XIII, 44-46).--B*ri*. Up. III, 5, 1 enjoins mauna as a third in
addition to bâlya and pâ*nd*itya (Adhik. XIV, 47-49).--By bâlya is to be
understood a childlike innocent state of mind (Adhik. XV, 50).

Sûtras 51 and 52 discuss, according to Râmânu*g*a, the question when the
vidyâ, which is the result of the means described in III, 4, arises.
Sûtra 51 treats of that vidyâ whose result is mere exaltation
(abhyudaya), and states that 'it takes place in the present life, if
there is not present an obstacle in the form of a prabalakarmântara (in
which latter case the vidyâ arises later only), on account of Scripture
declaring this (in various passages).'--Sûtra 52, 'Thus there is also
absence of a definite rule as to (the time of origination of) that
knowledge whose fruit is release, it being averred concerning that one
also that it is in the same condition (i.e. of sometimes having an
obstacle, sometimes not).--*S*a<u>n</u>kara, who treats the two Sûtras
as two adhikara*n*as, agrees as to the explanation of 51, while, putting
a somewhat forced interpretation on 52, he makes it out to mean that a
more or less is possible only in the case of the sagu*n*a-vidyâs.
