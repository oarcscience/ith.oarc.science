22\. The âkâ*s*a, i.e. ether (is Brahman) on account of characteristic
marks (of the latter being mentioned).

In the *Kh*ândogya (I, 9) the following passage is met with, 'What is
the origin of this world?' 'Ether,' he replied. 'For all these beings
take their rise from the ether only, and return into the ether. Ether is
greater than these, ether is their rest.'--Here the following doubt
arises. Does the word 'ether' denote the highest Brahman or the
elemental ether?--Whence the doubt?--Because the word is seen to be used
in both senses. Its use in the sense of 'elemental ether' is well
established in ordinary as well as in Vedic speech;

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

and, on the other hand, we see that it is sometimes used to denote
Brahman, viz. in cases where we ascertain, either from some
complementary sentence or from the fact of special qualities being
mentioned, that Brahman is meant. So, for instance, Taitt. Up. II, 7,
'If that bliss existed not in the ether;' and *Kh*. Up. VIII, 14, 'That
which is called ether is the revealer of all forms and names; that
within which forms and names are <span id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121.md)
that is Brahman.' Hence the doubt.--Which sense is then to be adopted in
our case?--The sense of elemental ether, the pûrvapakshin replies;
because this sense belongs to the word more commonly, and therefore
presents itself to the mind more readily. The word 'ether' cannot be
taken in both senses equally, because that would involve a (faulty)
attribution of several meanings to one and the same word. Hence the term
'ether' applies to Brahman in a secondary (metaphorical) sense only; on
account of Brahman being in many of its attributes, such as all
pervadingness and the like, similar to ether. The rule is, that when the
primary sense of a word is possible, the word must not be taken in a
secondary sense. And in the passage under discussion only the primary
sense of the word 'ether' is admissible. Should it be objected that, if
we refer the passage under discussion to the elemental ether, a
complementary passage ('for all these beings take their rise from the
ether only, &c.') cannot be satisfactorily accounted for; we reply that
the elemental ether also may be represented as a cause, viz. of air,
fire, &c. in due succession. For we read in Scripture (Taitt. Up. II,
1), 'From that Self sprang ether, from ether air, from air fire, and so
on.' The qualities also of being greater and of being a place of rest
may be ascribed to the elemental ether, if we consider its relations to
all other beings. Therefore we conclude that the word 'ether' here
denotes the elemental ether.

To this we reply as follows:--The word ether must here be taken to
denote Brahman, on account of characteristic marks of the latter being
mentioned. For the sentence,

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'All these beings
take their rise from the ether only,' clearly indicates the highest
Brahman, since all Vedânta-texts agree in definitely declaring that all
beings spring from the highest Brahman.--But, the opponent may say, we
have shown that the elemental ether also may be represented as the
cause, viz. of air, fire, and the other elements in due succession.--We
admit this. But still there remains the difficulty, that, unless we
understand the word to apply to the fundamental cause of all, viz.
Brahman, the affirmation contained in the word 'only' and the
qualification expressed by the word 'all' (in 'all beings') would be out
of place. Moreover, the clause, 'They return into the ether,' again
points to Brahman, and so likewise the phrase, 'Ether is greater than
these, ether is their rest;' for absolute superiority in point of
greatness Scripture attributes to the highest Self only; cp. *Kh*. Up.
III, 14, 3, 'Greater than the earth, greater than the sky, greater than
heaven, greater than all these worlds.' The quality of being a place of
rest likewise agrees best with the highest Brahman, on account of its
being the highest cause. This is confirmed by the following scriptural
passage: 'Knowledge and bliss is Brahman, it is the rest of him who
gives gifts' (B*ri*. Up. III, 9, 28). Moreover, *G*aivali finding fault
with the doctrine of *S*âlâvatya, on account of (his sâman) having an
end (*Kh*. Up. I, 8, 8), and wishing to proclaim something that has no
end chooses the ether, and then, having identified the ether with the
Udgîtha, concludes, 'He is the Udgîtha greater than great; he is without
end.' Now this endlessness is a characteristic mark of Brahman. To the
remark that the sense of 'elemental ether' presents itself to the mind
more readily, because it is the better established sense of the word
âkâ*s*a, we reply, that, although it may present itself to the mind
first, yet it is not to be accepted, because we see that qualities of
Brahman are mentioned in the complementary sentences. That the word
âkâ*s*a is also used to denote Brahman has been shown already; cp. such
passages as, 'Ether is the revealer of all names and forms.' We see,
moreover, that various synonyma of âkâ*s*a are employed to denote
Brahman. So, for instance, *Ri*k Sa*m*h.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I, 164, 39, 'In
which the Vedas are <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md), in the
Imperishable one (i. e. Brahman), the highest, the ether (vyoman), on
which all gods have their seat.' And Taitt. Up. III, 6, 'This is the
knowledge of Bh*ri*gu and Varu*n*a, founded on the highest ether
(vyoman).' And again, 'Om, ka is Brahman, ether (kha) is Brahman' (*Kh*.
Up. IV, 10, 5), and 'the old ether' (B*ri*. Up. V, 1) <span
id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_123.md). And other similar passages. On account
of the force of the complementary passage we are justified in deciding
that the word 'ether,' although occurring in the beginning of the
passage, refers to Brahman. The case is analogous to that of the
sentence, 'Agni (lit. the fire) studies a chapter,' where the word agni,
although occurring in the beginning, is at once seen to denote a
boy <span id="fr_124"></span>[3](#fn_124.md). It is therefore settled that
the word 'ether' denotes Brahman.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[84:3](sbe34028.htm#fr_124.md) The doubt about the
meaning of a word is preferably to be decided by means of a reference to
preceding passages; where that is not possible (the doubtful word
occurring at the beginning of some new chapter) complementary, i.e.
subsequent passages have to be taken into consideration.
