Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

27\. For the same reasons (the Vai*s*vânara) cannot be the divinity (of
fire), or the element (of fire).

The averment that the fanciful attribution of members contained in the
passage 'His head is Sute*g*as,' &c. may apply to the elemental fire
also which from the mantras is seen to be connected with the heavenly
world, &c., or else to the divinity whose body is fire, on account of
its power, is refuted by the following remark: For the reasons

already stated Vai*s*vânara is neither the divinity nor the element. For
to the elemental fire which is mere heat and light the heavenly world
and so on cannot properly be ascribed as head and so on, because an
effect cannot be the Self of another effect.--Again, the heavenly world
cannot be ascribed as head, &c. to the divinity of fire, in spite of the
power of the latter; for, on the one hand, it is not a cause (but a mere
effect), and on the other hand its power depends on the highest Lord.
Against all these interpretations there lies moreover the objection
founded on the inapplicability of the term 'Self.'
