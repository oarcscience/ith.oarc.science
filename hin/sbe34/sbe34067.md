Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

30\. On account of remembrance; so Bâdari opines.

Or else the highest Lord may be called 'measured by a span' because he
is remembered by means of the mind which is seated in the heart which is
measured by a span. Similarly, barley-corns which are measured by means
of prasthas are themselves called prasthas. It must be admitted that
barley-grains themselves have a certain size which is merely rendered
manifest through their being connected with a prastha measure; while the
highest Lord himself does not possess a size to be rendered manifest by
his connexion with the heart. Still the remembrance (of the Lord by
means of the mind) may be accepted as offering a certain foundation for
the *S*ruti passage concerning him who is measured by a span.--Or
else <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165.md) the Sûtra may be interpreted
to mean that the Lord, although not really measured by a span, is to be
remembered (meditated upon) as being of the measure of a span; whereby
the passage is furnished with an appropriate sense.--Thus the passage
about him who is measured by a span may, according to the opinion of the
teacher Bâdari, be referred to the highest Lord, on account of
remembrance.
