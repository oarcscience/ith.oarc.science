Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

3\. On the other hand, as (those qualities) are not possible (in it),
the embodied (soul is) not (denoted by manomaya, &c.).

The preceding Sûtra has declared that the qualities mentioned are
possible in Brahman; the present Sûtra states that they are not possible
in the embodied Self. Brahman only possesses, in the manner explained,
the qualities of consisting of mind, and so on; not the embodied
individual soul. For qualities such as expressed in the words, 'He whose
purposes are true, whose Self is the ether, who has no speech, who is
not disturbed, who is greater than the earth,' cannot easily be
attributed to the embodied Self. By the term 'embodied' (*s*ârîra) we
have to understand 'residing' in a body. If it be objected that the Lord
also resides in the body <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143.md), we
reply, True, he does reside in the body, but not in the body only; for
*s*ruti declares him to be all-pervading; compare, 'He is greater than
the earth; greater than the atmosphere, omnipresent like the ether,
eternal.' The individual soul, on the other

hand, is in the body only, apart from which as the abode of fruition it
does not exist.
