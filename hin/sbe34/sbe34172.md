33\. But (Brahman's creative activity) is mere sport, such as we see in
ordinary life.

The word 'but' discards the objection raised.--We see in every-day life
that certain doings of princes or other men of high position who have no
unfulfilled desires left have no

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

reference to any extraneous purpose; but proceed from mere sportfulness,
as, for instance, their recreations in places of amusement. We further
see that the process of inhalation and exhalation is going on without
reference to any extraneous purpose, merely following the law of its own
nature. Analogously, the activity of the Lord also may be supposed to be
mere sport, proceeding from his own nature <span
id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_314.md), without reference to any purpose. For
on the ground neither of reason nor of Scripture can we construe any
other purpose of the Lord. Nor can his nature be questioned <span
id="fr_315"></span>[2](#fn_315.md)--Although the creation of this world
appears to us a weighty and difficult undertaking, it is mere play to
the Lord, whose power is unlimited. And if in ordinary life we might
possibly, by close scrutiny, detect some subtle motive, even for
sportful action, we cannot do so with regard to the actions of the Lord,
all whose wishes are fulfilled, as Scripture says.--Nor can it be said
that he either does not act or acts like a senseless person; for
Scripture affirms the fact of the creation on the one hand, and the
Lord's omniscience on the other hand. And, finally, we must remember
that the scriptural doctrine of creation does not refer to the highest
reality; it refers to the apparent world only, which is characterised by
name and form, the figments of Nescience, and it, moreover, aims at
intimating that Brahman is the Self of everything.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_314"></span>[457:1](sbe34172.htm#fr_314.md) The nature
(svabhâva) of the Lord is, the commentators say, Mâyâ joined with time
and karman.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[457:2](sbe34172.htm#fr_315.md) This clause is an
answer to the objection that the Lord might remain at rest instead of
creating a world useless to himself and the cause of pain to others. For
in consequence of his conjunction with Mâyâ the creation is unavoidable.
Go. Ân. Avidyâ naturally tends towards effects, without any purpose.
