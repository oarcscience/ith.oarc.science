*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

36\. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications (in the
case of the higher castes) and on account of their absence being
declared (in the case of the *S*ûdras).

That the *S*ûdras are not qualified, follows from that circumstance also
that in different places of the vidyâs such ceremonies as the upanayana
and the like are referred to. Compare, for instance, *S*at. Br. XI, 5,
3, 13, 'He initiated him as a pupil;' *Kh*. Up. VII, 1, 1, 'Teach me,
Sir! thus he approached him;' Pra. Up. I, 1, 'Devoted to Brahman, firm
in Brahman, seeking for the highest Brahman they, carrying fuel in their
hands, approached the venerable Pippalâda, thinking that he would teach
them all that.'--Thus the following passage also, 'He without having
made them undergo the upanayana (said) to them' (*Kh*. Up. V, 11, 7),
shows that the upanayana is a well-established ceremony <span
id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_229.md).--With reference to the *S*ûdras, on the
other hand, the absence of ceremonies is frequently mentioned; so, for
instance, Manu X, 4, where they are spoken of as 'once born' only ('the
*S*ûdra is the fourth caste, once-born'), and Manu X, 126, 'In the
*S*ûdra there is not any sin, and he is not fit for any ceremony.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_229"></span>[227:1](sbe34105.htm#fr_229.md) The king
A*s*vapati receives some Brâhma*n*as as his pupils without insisting on
the upanayana. This express statement of the upanayana having been
omitted in a certain case shows it to be the general rule.
