*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6\. If it is said that (the word 'seeing') has a figurative meaning, we
deny that, on account of the word Self (being applied to the cause of
the world).

Your assertion that the term 'Being' denotes the non-intelligent
pradhâna, and that thought is ascribed to it in a figurative sense only,
as it is to fire and water, is untenable. Why so? On account of the term
'Self.' For the passage *Kh*. Up. VI, 2, which begins 'Being only, my
dear, this was in the beginning,' after having related the creation of
fire, water, and earth ('it thought,' &c.; 'it sent forth fire,' &c.),
goes on--denoting the thinking principle of which the whole chapter
treats, and likewise fire, water, and earth, by the
term--'divinities'--as follows, 'That divinity thought: Let me now enter
those three divinities with this living Self (*g*îva. âtman) and evolve
names and forms.' If we assumed that in this passage the non-intelligent
pradhâna is figuratively spoken of as thinking, we should also have to
assume that the same pradhâna--as once constituting the subject-matter
of the chapter--is referred to by the term 'that divinity.' But in that
case the divinity would not speak of the *g*îva as 'Self.' For by the
term '*G*iva' we must understand, according to the received meaning and
the etymology of the word, the intelligent (principle) which rules over
the body and sustains the vital airs. How could such a principle be the
Self of the non-intelligent pradhâna? By 'Self' we understand (a
being's) own nature, and it is clear that the intelligent *G*iva cannot
constitute the nature of the non-intelligent pradhâna. If, on the other
hand, we refer the whole chapter to the intelligent Brahman, to

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

which thought in its primary sense belongs, the use of the word 'Self'
with reference to the *G*îva is quite adequate. Then again there is the
other passage, 'That which is that subtle essence, in it all that exists
has its self. It is the true. It is the Self. That art thou, O
*S*vetaketu' (*Kh*. Up. VI, 8, 7, &c.). Here the clause 'It is the Self'
designates the Being of which the entire chapter treats, viz. the subtle
Self, by the word 'Self,' and the concluding clause, 'that art thou, O
*S*vetaketu,' declares the intelligent *S*vetaketu to be of the nature
of the Self. Fire and water, on the other hand, are non-intelligent,
since they are objects (of the mind), and since they are declared to be
implicated in the evolution of names and forms. And as at the same time
there is no reason for ascribing to them thought in its primary
sense--while the employment of the word 'Self' furnishes such a reason
with reference to the Sat--the thought attributed to them must be
explained in a figurative sense, like the inclination of the river-bank.
Moreover, the thinking on the part of fire and water is to be understood
as dependent on their being ruled over by the Sat. On the other hand,
the thought of the Sat is, on account of the word 'Self,' not to be
understood in a figurative sense. <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99.md)

Here the Sâ<u>n</u>khya comes forward with a new objection. The word
'Self,' he says, may be applied to the pradhâna, although unintelligent,
because it is sometimes figuratively used in the sense of 'that which
effects all purposes of another;' as, for instance, a king applies the
word 'Self' to some servant who carries out all the king's intentions,
'Bhadrasena is my (other) Self.' For the pradhâna, which effects the
enjoyment and the emancipation of the soul, serves the latter in the
same way as a minister serves his king in the affairs of peace and war.
Or else, it may be said, the one word 'Self' may refer to
non-intelligent things as well as to intelligent beings, as we see that
such expressions as 'the Self of the elements,' 'the Self of the
senses,' are made use of, and as the one word 'light' (*g*yotis) denotes
a certain

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

sacrifice (the *g*yotish*t*oma) as well as a flame. How then does it
follow from the word 'Self' that the thinking (ascribed to the cause of
the world) is not to be taken in a figurative sense?

To this last argumentation the Sûtrakâra replies:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_99"></span>[54:1](sbe34012.htm#fr_99.md) So that, on this
latter explanation, it is unnecessary to assume a figurative sense of
the word 'thinking' in any of the three passages.
