*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

25\. (And) because that which is stated by Sm*ri*ti (i.e. the shape of
the highest Lord as described by Sm*ri*ti) is an inference (i.e. an
indicatory mark from which we infer the meaning of *S*ruti).

The highest Lord only is Vai*s*vânara, for that reason also that
Sm*ri*ti ascribes to the highest Lord only a shape consisting of the
threefold world, the fire constituting his mouth, the heavenly world his
head, &c. So, for instance, in the following passage, 'He whose mouth is
fire, whose head the heavenly world, whose navel the ether, whose feet
the earth, whose eye the sun, whose ears the regions, reverence to him
the Self of the world.' The shape described here in Sm*ri*ti allows us
to infer a *S*ruti passage on which the Sm*ri*ti rests, and thus
constitutes an inference, i.e. a sign indicatory of the word
'Vai*s*vânara' denoting the highest Lord. For, although the quoted
Sm*ri*ti passage contains a glorification <span

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

still even a glorification in the form in which it there appears is not
possible, unless it has a Vedic passage to rest on.--Other Sm*ri*ti
passages also may be quoted in connexion with this Sûtra, so, for
instance, the following one, 'He whose head the wise declare to be the
heavenly world, whose navel the ether, whose eyes sun and moon, whose
ears the regions, and whose feet the earth, he is the inscrutable leader
of all beings.'
