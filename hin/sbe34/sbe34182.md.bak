6\. Even if we admit (the Sâ<u>n</u>khya position refuted in what
precedes, it is invalidated by other objections) on account of the
absence of a purpose (on the part of the pradhâna).

Even if we, accommodating ourselves to your (the Sâ<u>n</u>khya's)
belief, should admit what has been disproved in the preceding Sûtra,
viz. that the pradhâna is spontaneously active, still your opinion would
lie open to an objection 'on account of the absence of a purpose.' For
if the spontaneous activity of the pradhâna has, as you say, no
reference to anything else, it will have no reference not only to any
aiding principle, but also to any purpose or motive, and consequently
your doctrine that the pradhâna is active in order to effect the purpose
of man will become untenable. If you reply that the pradhâna does not
indeed regard any aiding principle, but does regard a purpose, we remark
that in that case we must distinguish between the different possible
purposes, viz. either enjoyment (on the part of the soul), or final
release, or both. If enjoyment, what enjoyment, we ask, can belong to
the soul which is naturally incapable of any accretion (of pleasure or
pain) <span id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_331.md)? Moreover, there would in
that case be no opportunity for release <span
id="fr_332"></span>[2](#fn_332.md).--If release, then the activity of the
pradhâna would be purposeless, as even antecedently to it the soul is in
the

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

state of release; moreover, there would then be no occasion for the
perception of sounds, &c. <span id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_333.md)--If
both, then, on account of the infinite number of the objects of pradhâna
to be enjoyed (by the soul) <span id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_334.md), there
would be no opportunity for final release. Nor can the satisfaction of a
desire be considered as the purpose of the activity of the pradhâna; for
neither the non-intelligent pradhâna nor the essentially pure soul can
feel any desire.--If, finally, you should assume the pradhâna to be
active, because otherwise the power of sight (belonging to the soul on
account of its intelligent nature) and the creative power (belonging to
the pradhâna) would be purposeless; it would follow that, as the
creative power of the pradhâna does not cease at any time any more than
the soul's power of sight docs, the apparent world would never come to
an end, so that no final release of the soul could take place <span
id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_335.md).--It is, therefore, impossible to
maintain that the pradhâna enters on its activity for the purposes of
the soul.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[372:2](sbe34182.htm#fr_332.md) For the soul as
being of an entirely inactive nature cannot of itself aim at release,
and the pradhâna aims--ex hypothesi--only at the soul's undergoing
varied experience.
