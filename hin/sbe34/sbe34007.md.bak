REVERENCE TO THE AUGUST VÂSUDEVA!

It is a matter not requiring any proof that the object and the
subject <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) whose respective spheres are
the notion of the 'Thou' (the Non-Ego <span
id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37).md) and the 'Ego,' and which are opposed to
each other as much as darkness and light are, cannot be identified. All
the less can their respective attributes be identified. Hence it follows
that it is wrong to superimpose <span id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md) upon
the subject--whose Self is intelligence, and which has for its sphere
the notion of the Ego--the object whose sphere is the notion of the
Non-Ego, and the attributes of the object, and *vice versâ* to
superimpose the subject and the attributes of the subject on the object.
In spite of this it is on the part of man a natural <span
id="fr_39"></span>[4](#fn_39.md) procedure--

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

which has its cause in wrong knowledge--not to distinguish the two
entities (object and subject) and their respective attributes, although
they are absolutely distinct, but to superimpose upon each the
characteristic nature and the attributes of the other, and thus,
coupling the Real and the Unreal <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md), to
make use of expressions such as 'That am I,' 'That is mine <span
id="fr_41"></span>[2](#fn_41.md).'--But what have we to understand by the
term 'superimposition?'--The apparent presentation, in the form of
remembrance, to consciousness of something previously observed, in some
other thing <span id="fr_42"></span>[3](#fn_42.md). Some indeed define the
term 'superimposition' as the superimposition of the attributes of one
thing on another thing <span id="fr_43"></span>[4](#fn_43.md). Others,
again, define superimposition as the error

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

founded on the non-apprehension of the difference of that which is
superimposed from that on which it is superimposed <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md). Others <span
id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md), again, define it as the fictitious
assumption of attributes contrary to the nature of that thing on which
something else is superimposed. But all these definitions agree in so
far as they represent superimposition as the apparent presentation of
the attributes of one thing in another thing. And therewith agrees also
the popular view which is exemplified by expressions such as the
following: 'Mother-of-pearl appears like silver,' 'The moon although one
only appears as if she were double.' But how is it possible that on the
interior Self which itself is not an object there should be superimposed
objects and their attributes? For every one superimposes an object only
on such other objects as are placed before him (i.e. in contact with his
sense-organs), and you have said before that the interior Self which is
entirely disconnected from the idea of the Thou (the Non-Ego) is never
an object. It is not, we reply, non-object in the absolute sense. For it
is the object of the notion of the Ego <span
id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_46.md), and the interior Self is well known to
exist on account of its immediate (intuitive) presentation. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[4](#fn_47.md) Nor is it an exceptionless rule that
objects

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

can be superimposed only on such other objects as are before us, i.e. in
contact with our sense-organs; for non-discerning men superimpose on the
ether, which is not the object of sensuous perception, dark-blue colour.

Hence it follows that the assumption of the Non-Self being superimposed
on the interior Self is not unreasonable.

This superimposition thus defined, learned men consider to be Nescience
(avidyâ), and the ascertainment of the true nature of that which is (the
Self) by means of the discrimination of that (which is superimposed on
the Self), they call knowledge (vidyâ). There being such knowledge
(neither the Self nor the Non-Self) are affected in the least by any
blemish or (good) quality produced by their mutual superimposition <span
id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md). The mutual superimposition of the Self
and the Non-Self, which is termed Nescience, is the presupposition on
which there base all the practical distinctions--those made in ordinary
life as well as those laid down by the Veda--between means of knowledge,
objects of knowledge (and knowing persons), and all scriptural texts,
whether they are concerned with injunctions and prohibitions (of
meritorious and non-meritorious actions), or with final release <span
id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49.md).--But how can the means of right

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

knowledge such as perception, inference, &c., and scriptural texts have
for their object that which is dependent on Nescience <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)?--Because, we reply, the means of right
knowledge cannot operate unless there be a knowing personality, and
because the existence of the latter depends on the erroneous notion that
the body, the senses, and so on, are identical with, or belong to, the
Self of the knowing person. For without the employment of the senses,
perception and the other means of right knowledge cannot operate. And
without a basis (i.e. the body <span id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51).md) the
senses cannot act. Nor does anybody act by means of a body on which the
nature of the Self is not superimposed <span
id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md). Nor can, in the absence of all that <span
id="fr_53"></span>[4](#fn_53.md), the Self which, in its own nature is free
from all contact, become a knowing agent. And if there is no knowing
agent, the means of right knowledge cannot operate (as said above).
Hence perception and the other means of right knowledge, and the Vedic
texts have for their object that which is dependent on Nescience. (That
human cognitional activity has for its presupposition the
superimposition described above), follows also from the non-difference
in that respect of men from animals. Animals, when sounds or other
sensible qualities affect their sense of hearing or other senses, recede
or advance according as the idea derived from the sensation is a
comforting or disquieting one. A cow, for instance, when she sees a man
approaching with a raised stick in his hand, thinks that he wants to
beat her, and therefore moves away; while she walks up to a man who
advances with some fresh grass in his hand. Thus men also--who possess a
higher intelligence--run away when

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

they see strong fierce-looking fellows drawing near with shouts and
brandishing swords; while they confidently approach persons of contrary
appearance and behaviour. We thus see that men and animals follow the
same course of procedure with reference to the means and objects of
knowledge. Now it is well known that the procedure of animals bases on
the non-distinction (of Self and Non-Self); we therefore conclude that,
as they present the same appearances, men also--although distinguished
by superior intelligence--proceed with regard to perception and so on,
in the same way as animals do; as long, that is to say, as the mutual
superimposition of Self and Non-Self lasts. With reference again to that
kind of activity which is founded on the Veda (sacrifices and the like),
it is true indeed that the reflecting man who is qualified to enter on
it, does so not without knowing that the Self has a relation to another
world; yet that qualification does not depend on the knowledge,
derivable from the Vedânta-texts, of the true nature of the Self as free
from all wants, raised above the distinctions of the Brâhma*n*a and
Kshattriya-classes and so on, transcending transmigratory existence. For
such knowledge is useless and even contradictory to the claim (on the
part of sacrificers, &c. to perform certain actions and enjoy their
fruits). And before such knowledge of the Self has arisen, the Vedic
texts continue in their operation, to have for their object that which
is dependent on Nescience. For such texts as the following, 'A
Brâhma*n*a is to sacrifice,' are operative only on the supposition that
on the Self are superimposed particular conditions such as caste, stage
of life, age, outward circumstances, and so on. That by superimposition
we have to understand the notion of something in some other thing we
have already explained. (The superimposition of the Non-Self will be
understood more definitely from the following examples.) Extra-personal
attributes are superimposed on the Self, if a man considers himself
sound and entire, or the contrary, as long as his wife, children, and so
on are sound and entire or not. Attributes of the body are superimposed
on the Self, if a man

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

thinks of himself (his Self) as stout, lean, fair, as standing, walking,
or jumping. Attributes of the sense-organs, if he thinks 'I am mute, or
deaf, or one-eyed, or blind.' Attributes of the internal organ when he
considers himself subject to desire, intention, doubt, determination,
and so on. Thus the producer of the notion of the Ego (i.e. the internal
organ) is superimposed on the interior Self, which, in reality, is the
witness of all the modifications of the internal organ, and vice versâ
the interior Self, which is the witness of everything, is superimposed
on the internal organ, the senses, and so on. In this way there goes on
this natural beginning--and endless superimposition, which appears in
the form of wrong conception, is the cause of individual souls appearing
as agents and enjoyers (of the results of their actions), and is
observed by every one.

With a view to freeing one's self from that wrong notion which is the
cause of all evil and attaining thereby the knowledge of the absolute
unity of the Self the study of the Vedânta-texts is begun. That all the
Vedânta-texts have the mentioned purport we shall show in this so-called
*S*ârîraka-mîmâ*m*sâ <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md).

Of this Vedânta-mîmâ*m*sâ about to be explained by us the first Sûtra is
as follows.

1\. Then therefore the enquiry into Brahman.

The word 'then' is here to be taken as denoting immediate consecution;
not as indicating the introduction of a new subject to be entered upon;
for the enquiry into Brahman (more literally, the desire of knowing
Brahman) is not of that nature <span id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md). Nor
has the word 'then' the sense

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

of auspiciousness (or blessing); for a word of that meaning could not be
properly construed as a part of the sentence. The word 'then' rather
acts as an auspicious term by being pronounced and heard merely, while
it denotes at the same time something else, viz. immediate consecution
as said above. That the latter is its meaning follows moreover from the
circumstance that the relation in which the result stands to the
previous topic (viewed as the cause of the result) is non-separate from
the relation of immediate consecution <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md).

If, then, the word 'then' intimates immediate consecution it must be
explained on what antecedent the enquiry into Brahman specially depends;
just as the enquiry into active religious duty (which forms the subject
of the Pûrvâ Mîmâ*m*sâ) specially depends on the antecedent reading of
the Veda. The reading of the Veda indeed is the common antecedent (for
those who wish to enter on an enquiry into religious duty as well as for
those desirous of knowing Brahman). The special question with regard to
the enquiry into Brahman is whether it presupposes as its antecedent the
understanding of the acts of religious duty (which is acquired by means
of the Pûrvâ Mîmâ*m*sâ). To this question we reply in the negative,
because for a man who has read the Vedânta-parts of the Veda it is
possible to enter on the enquiry into Brahman even before engaging in
the enquiry into religious duty. Nor is it the purport of the word
'then' to indicate order of succession; a purport which it serves in
other passages, as, for instance, in the one enjoining the cutting off
of pieces from the heart and other

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

parts of the sacrificial animal. <span id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md)
(For the intimation of order of succession could be intended only if the
agent in both cases were the same; but this is not the case), because
there is no proof for assuming the enquiry into religious duty and the
enquiry into Brahman to stand in the relation of principal and
subordinate matter or the relation of qualification (for a certain act)
on the part of the person qualified <span id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58.md);
and because the result as well as the object of the enquiry differs in
the two cases. The knowledge of active religious duty has for its fruit
transitory felicity, and that again depends on the performance of
religious acts. The enquiry into Brahman, on the other hand, has for its
fruit eternal bliss, and does not depend on the performance of any acts.
Acts of religious duty do not yet exist at the time when they are
enquired into, but are something to be accomplished (in the future); for
they depend on the activity of man. In the Brahma-mîmâ*m*sâ, on the
other hand, the object of enquiry, i.e. Brahman, is something already
accomplished (existent),--for it is eternal,--and does not depend on
human energy. The two enquiries differ moreover in so far as the
operation of their respective fundamental texts is concerned. For the
fundamental texts on which active religious duty depends convey
information to man in so far only as they enjoin on him their own
particular subjects (sacrifices, &c.); while the fundamental texts about
Brahman merely instruct man, without laying on him the injunction of
being instructed, instruction being their immediate result. The case is
analogous to that of the information regarding objects of sense which
ensues as soon as the objects are approximated to the senses. It
therefore is requisite that something should be

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

stated subsequent to which the enquiry into Brahman is proposed.--Well,
then, we maintain that the antecedent conditions are the discrimination
of what is eternal and what is non-eternal; the renunciation of all
desire to enjoy the fruit (of one's actions) both here and hereafter;
the acquirement of tranquillity, self-restraint, and the other
means <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59.md), and the desire of final
release. If these conditions exist, a man may, either before entering on
an enquiry into active religious duty or after that, engage in the
enquiry into Brahman and come to know it; but not otherwise. The word
'then' therefore intimates that the enquiry into Brahman is subsequent
to the acquisition of the above-mentioned (spiritual) means.

The word 'therefore' intimates a reason. Because the Veda, while
declaring that the fruit of the agnihotra and similar performances which
are means of happiness is non-eternal (as, for instance. *Kh.* Up. VIII,
1, 6, 'As here on earth whatever has been acquired by action perishes so
perishes in the next world whatever is acquired by acts of religious
duty'), teaches at the same time that the highest aim of man is realised
by the knowledge of Brahman (as, for instance, Taitt. Up. II, I, 'He who
knows Brahman attains the highest'); therefore the enquiry into Brahman
is to be undertaken subsequently to the acquirement of the mentioned
means.

By Brahman is to be understood that the definition of which will be
given in the next Sûtra (I, 1, 2); it is therefore not to be supposed
that the word Brahman may here denote something else, as, for instance,
the brahminical caste. In the Sûtra the genitive case ('of Brahman;' the
literal translation of the Sûtra being 'then therefore the desire of
knowledge of Brahman') denotes the object, not something generally
supplementary (*s*esha <span id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60).md); for the
desire of knowledge

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

demands an object of desire and no other such object is stated.--But why
should not the genitive case be taken as expressing the general
complementary relation (to express which is its proper office)? Even in
that case it might constitute the object of the desire of knowledge,
since the general relation may base itself on the more particular
one.--This assumption, we reply, would mean that we refuse to take
Brahman as the direct object, and then again indirectly introduce it as
the object; an altogether needless procedure.--Not needless; for if we
explain the words of the Sûtra to mean 'the desire of knowledge
connected with Brahman' we thereby virtually promise that also all the
heads of discussion which bear on Brahman will be treated.--This reason
also, we reply, is not strong enough to uphold your interpretation. For
the statement of some principal matter already implies all the secondary
matters connected therewith. Hence if Brahman, the most eminent of all
objects of knowledge, is mentioned, this implies already all those
objects of enquiry which the enquiry into Brahman presupposes, and those
objects need therefore not be mentioned, especially in the Sûtra.
Analogously the sentence 'there the king is going' implicitly means that
the king together with his retinue is going there. Our interpretation
(according to which the Sûtra represents Brahman as the direct object of
knowledge) moreover agrees with Scripture, which directly represents
Brahman as the object of the desire of knowledge; compare, for instance,
the passage, 'That from whence these beings are born, &c., desire to
know that. That is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. III, I). With passages of this
kind the Sûtra only agrees if the genitive case is taken to denote the
object. Hence we do take it in that sense. The object of the desire is
the knowledge of Brahman up to its complete comprehension, desires
having reference to results <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md).
Knowledge thus constitutes the

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

means by which the complete comprehension of Brahman is desired to be
obtained. For the complete comprehension of Brahman is the highest end
of man, since it destroys the root of all evil such as Nescience, the
seed of the entire Sa*m*sâra. Hence the desire of knowing Brahman is to
be entertained.

But, it may be asked, is Brahman known or not known (previously to the
enquiry into its nature)? If it is known we need not enter on an enquiry
concerning it; if it is not known we can not enter on such an enquiry.

We reply that Brahman is known. Brahman, which is all-knowing and
endowed with all powers, whose essential nature is eternal purity,
intelligence, and freedom, exists. For if we consider the derivation of
the word 'Brahman,' from the root b*ri*h, 'to be great,' we at once
understand that eternal purity, and so on, belong to Brahman <span
id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md). Moreover the existence of Brahman is
known on the ground of its being the Self of every one. For every one is
conscious of the existence of (his) Self, and never thinks 'I am not.'
If the existence of the Self were not known, every one would think 'I am
not.' And this Self (of whose existence all are conscious) is Brahman.
But if Brahman is generally known as the Self, there is no room for an
enquiry into it! Not so, we reply; for there is a conflict of opinions
as to its special nature. Unlearned people and the Lokâyatikas are of
opinion that the mere body endowed with the quality of intelligence is
the Self; others that the organs endowed with intelligence are the Self;
others maintain that the internal organ is the Self; others, again, that
the Self is a mere momentary idea; others, again, that it is the Void.
Others, again (to proceed to the opinion of such as acknowledge the
authority of the Veda), maintain that there is a transmigrating being
different from the body, and so on, which is both agent and enjoyer (of
the fruits of action); others teach

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

that that being is enjoying only, not acting; others believe that in
addition to the individual souls, there is an all-knowing, all-powerful
Lord <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md). Others, finally, (i.e. the
Vedântins) maintain that the Lord is the Self of the enjoyer (i.e. of
the individual soul whose individual existence is apparent only, the
product of Nescience).

Thus there are many various opinions, basing part of them on sound
arguments and scriptural texts, part of them on fallacious arguments and
scriptural texts misunderstood <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md). If
therefore a man would embrace some one of these opinions without
previous consideration, he would bar himself from the highest beatitude
and incur grievous loss. For this reason the first Sûtra proposes, under
the designation of an enquiry into Brahman, a disquisition of the
Vedânta-texts, to be carried on with the help of conformable arguments,
and having for its aim the highest beatitude.

So far it has been said that Brahman is to be enquired into. The
question now arises what the characteristics of that Brahman are, and
the reverend author of the Sûtras therefore propounds the following
aphorism.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_36"></span>[3:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_36.md) The subject is the
universal Self whose nature is intelligence (*k*it); the object
comprises whatever is of a non-intelligent nature, viz. bodies with
their sense organs, internal organs, and the objects of the senses, i.e.
the external material world.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[3:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_37.md) The object is said to
have for its sphere the notion of the 'thou' (yushmat), not the notion
of the 'this' or 'that' (idam), in order better to mark its absolute
opposition to the subject or Ego. Language allows of the co-ordination
of the pronouns of the first and the third person ('It is I,' 'I am he
who,' &c.; ete vayam, ime vayam âsmahe), but not of the co-ordination of
the pronouns of the first and second person.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[3:3](sbe34007.htm#fr_38.md) Adhyâsa, literally
'superimposition' in the sense of (mistaken) ascription or imputation,
to something, of an essential nature or attributes not belonging to it.
See later on.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[3:4](sbe34007.htm#fr_39.md) Natural, i.e.
original, beginngless; for the modes of speech <span id="page_4">p.
4</span> and action which characterise transmigratory existence have
existed, with the latter, from all eternity.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[4:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_40.md) I.e. the intelligent
Self which is the only reality and the non-real objects, viz. body and
so on, which are the product of wrong knowledge.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[4:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_41.md) 'The body, &c. is my
Self;' 'sickness, death, children, wealth, &c., belong to my Self.'

<span id="fn_42"></span>[4:3](sbe34007.htm#fr_42.md) Literally 'in some
other place.' The clause 'in the form of remembrance' is added, the
Bhâmatî remarks, in order to exclude those cases where something
previously observed is recognised in some other thing or place; as when,
for instance, the generic character of a cow which was previously
observed in a black cow again presents itself to consciousness in a grey
cow, or when Devadatta whom we first saw in Pâ*t*aliputra again appears
before us in Mâhishmatî. These are cases of recognition where the object
previously observed again presents itself to our senses; while in mere
remembrance the object previously perceived is not in renewed contact
with the senses. Mere remembrance operates in the case of adhyâsa, as
when we mistake mother-of-pearl for silver which is at the time not
present but remembered only.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[4:4](sbe34007.htm#fr_43.md) The so-called
anyathâkhyâtivâdins maintain that in the act of adhyâsa the attributes
of one thing, silver for instance, are superimposed on a different thing
existing in a different place, mother-of-pearl for instance (if we take
for our example of adhyâsa the case of some man mistaking a piece of
mother-of-pearl before him for a piece of silver). The âtmakhyâtivâdins
maintain that in adhyâsa the modification, in the form of silver, of the
internal organ and action which characterise transmigratory existence
have existed, with the latter, from all eternity.<span id="page_5">p.
5</span> is superimposed on the external thing mother-of-pearl and thus
itself appears external. Both views fall under the above definition.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[5:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_44.md) This is the definition
of the akhyâtivâdins.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[5:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_45.md) Some
anyathâkhyâtivâdins and the Mâdhyamikas according to Ânanda Giri.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[5:3](sbe34007.htm#fr_46.md) The pratyagâtman is in
reality non-object, for it is svayamprakâ*s*a, self-luminous, i.e. the
subjective factor in all cognition. But it becomes the object of the
idea of the Ego in so far as it is limited, conditioned by its adjuncts
which are the product of Nescience, viz. the internal organ, the senses
and the subtle and gross bodies, i. e. in so far as it is *g*îva,
individual or personal soul. Cp. Bhâmatî, pp. 22, 23: '*k*idâtmaiva
svayamprakâ*s*os\#pi buddhyâdivishayavi*kkh*ura*n*ât katha*mk*id
asmatpratyayavishayos\#ha*m*kârâspada*m* gîva iti *k*a *g*antur iti *k*a
kshetra*gñ*a iti *k*âkhyâyate.'

<span id="fn_47"></span>[5:4](sbe34007.htm#fr_47.md) Translated according
to the Bhâmatî. We deny, the objector says, the possibility of adhyâsa
in the case of the Self, not on the ground that it is not an object
because self-luminous (for that it <span id="page_6">p. 6</span> may be
an object although it is self-luminous you have shown), but on the
ground that it is not an object because it is not manifested either by
itself or by anything else.--It is known or manifest, the Vedântin
replies, on account of its immediate presentation (aparokshatvât), i.e.
on account of the intuitional knowledge we have of it. Ânanda Giri
construes the above clause in a different way:
asmatpratyayâvishayatves\#py aparokshatvâd ekântenâvishayatvâbbâvât
tasminn aha<u>n</u>kârâdyadhyâsa ity artha*h*. Aparokshatvam api
kai*sk*id âtmano nesh*t*am ity âsa<u>n</u>kyâha pratyagâtmeti.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[6:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_49.md) Whether they belong to
the karmakâ*nd*â, i.e. that part of the Veda which enjoins active
religious duty or the *gñ*ânakâ*nd*a, i.e. that part of the Veda which
treats of Brahman.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[7:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_50.md) It being of course the
function of the means of right knowledge to determine Truth and Reality.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[7:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_51.md) The Bhâmatî takes
adhish*th*ânam in the sense of superintendence, guidance. The senses
cannot act unless guided by a superintending principle, i.e. the
individual soul.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[7:3](sbe34007.htm#fr_52.md) If activity could
proceed from the body itself, non-identified with the Self, it would
take place in deep sleep also.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[7:4](sbe34007.htm#fr_53.md) I.e. in the absence of
the mutual superimposition of the Self and the Non-Self and their
attributes.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[9:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_54.md) The Mîmâ*m*sâ, i.e.
the enquiry whose aim it is to show that the embodied Self, i.e. the
individual or personal soul is one with Brahman. This Mîmâ*m*sâ being an
enquiry into the meaning of the Vedânta-portions of the Veda, it is also
called Vedânta mîmâ*m*sâ.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[10:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_56.md) Any relation in which
the result, i.e. here the enquiry into Brahman may stand to some
antecedent of which it is the effect may be comprised under the relation
of ânantarya.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[11:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_57.md) He cuts off from the
heart, then from the tongue, then from the breast.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[11:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_58.md) Where one action is
subordinate to another as, for instance, the offering of the prayâ*g*as
is to the dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa-sacrifice, or where one action qualifies a
person for another as, for instance, the offering of the
dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa qualifies a man for the performance of the
Soma-sacrifice, there is unity of the agent, and consequently an
intimation of the order of succession of the actions is in its right
place.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[12:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_59.md) The 'means' in
addition to *s*ama and dama are discontinuance of religious ceremonies
(uparati), patience in suffering (titikshâ), attention and concentration
of the mind (samâdhâna), and faith (*s*raddhâ).

<span id="fn_60"></span>[12:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_60.md) According to Pâ*n*ini
II, 3, 50 the sixth (genitive) case expresses the relation of one thing
being generally supplementary to, or connected with, some other thing.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[13:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_61.md) In the case of other
transitive verbs, object and result may be separate; so, for instance,
when it is said 'grâma*m* ga*kkh*ati,' the village is the object of the
action of going, and the arrival at the village its result. But in the
case of verbs of desiring object and result coincide.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[14:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_62.md) That Brahman exists
we know, even before entering on the Brahma-mîmâ*m*sâ, from the
occurrence of the word in the Veda, &c., and from the etymology of the
word we at once infer Brahman's chief attributes.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[15:1](sbe34007.htm#fr_63.md) The three last
opinions are those of the followers of the Nyâya, the Sâ<u>n</u>khya,
and the Yoga-philosophy respectively. The three opinions mentioned first
belong to various materialistic schools; the two subsequent ones to two
sects of Bauddha philosophers.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[15:2](sbe34007.htm#fr_64.md) As, for instance, the
passages 'this person consists of the essence of food;' 'the eye, &c.
spoke;' 'non-existing this was in the beginning,' &c.
