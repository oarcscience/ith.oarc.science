35\. Nor is non-contradiction to be derived from the succession (of
parts acceding to and departing from the soul), on account of the
change, &c. (of the soul).

Nor can the doctrine of the soul having the same size as the body be
satisfactorily established by means of the hypothesis of the successive
accession and withdrawal of particles. For this hypothesis would involve
the soul's undergoing changes and the like. If the soul is continually
being repleted and depleted by the successive addition and withdrawal of
parts, it of course follows that it undergoes change, and if it is
liable to change it follows that it is non-permanent, like the skin and
similar substances. From that, again, it follows that the *G*aina
doctrine of bondage and release is untenable; according to which
doctrine 'the soul, which in the state of bondage is encompassed by the
ogdoad of works and sunk in the ocean of sa*m*sâra, rises when its bonds
are sundered, as the gourd rises to the surface of the water when it is
freed from the encumbering clay <span
id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_419.md).'--Moreover, those particles which in
turns come and depart have the attributes of coming and going, and
cannot, on that account, be of the nature of the Self any more than the
body is. And if it be said that the Self consists of some permanently
remaining parts, we remark that it would be impossible to determine
which are the permanent and which the temporary parts.--We have further
to ask from whence those particles originate when they accede to the
soul, and into what they are merged when they detach themselves from it.
They cannot spring from the material elements

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

and re-enter the elements; for the soul is immaterial. Nor have we any
means to prove the existence of some other, general or special,
reservoir of soul-particles.--Moreover, on the hypothesis under
discussion the soul would be of indefinite nature, as the size of the
particles acceding and departing is itself indefinite.--On account of
all these and similar difficulties it cannot be maintained that certain
particles by turns attach themselves to, and detach themselves from, the
soul.

The Sûtra may be taken in a different sense also. The preceding Sûtra
has proved that the soul if of the same size as the body cannot be
permanent, as its entering into bigger and smaller bodies involves its
limitation. To this the Gymnosophist may be supposed to rejoin that
although the soul's size successively changes it may yet be permanent,
just as the stream of water is permanent (although the water continually
changes). An analogous instance would be supplied by the permanency of
the stream of ideas while the individual ideas, as that of a red cloth
and so on, are non-permanent.--To this rejoinder our Sûtra replies that
if the stream is not real we are led back to the doctrine of a general
void, and that, if it is something real, the difficulties connected with
the soul's changing, &c. present themselves and render the *G*aina view
impossible.
