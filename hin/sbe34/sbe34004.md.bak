# SECOND ADHYÂYA.

The first adhyâya has proved that all the Vedânta-texts unanimously
teach that there is only one cause of the world, viz. Brahman, whose
nature is intelligence, and that there exists no scriptural passage
which can be used to establish systems opposed to the Vedânta, more
especially the Sâ<u>n</u>khya system. The task of the two first pâdas of
the second adhyâya is to rebut any objections which may be raised
against the Vedânta doctrine on purely speculative grounds, apart from
scriptural authority, and to show, again on purely speculative grounds,
that none of the systems irreconcilable with the Vedânta can be
satisfactorily established.

### PÂDA I.

Adhikara*n*a I refutes the Sâ<u>n</u>khya objection that the acceptation
of the Vedânta system involves the rejection of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya
doctrine which after all constitutes a part of Sm*ri*ti, and as such has
claims on consideration.--To accept the Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sm*ri*ti, the
Vedântin replies, would compel us to reject other Sm*ri*tis, such as the
Manu-sm*ri*ti, which are opposed to the Sâ<u>n</u>khya doctrine. The
conflicting claims of Sm*ri*tis can be settled only on the ground of the
Veda, and there can be no doubt that the Veda does not confirm the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sm*ri*ti, but rather those Sm*ri*tis which teach the
origination of the world from an intelligent primary cause.

Adhik. II (3) extends the same line of argumentation to the
Yoga-sm*ri*ti.

Adhik. III (4-11) shows that Brahman, although of the nature of
intelligence, yet may be the cause of the non-intelligent material
world, and that it is not contaminated by the qualities of the world
when the latter is refunded into Brahman. For ordinary experience
teaches us that like does not always spring from like, and that the
qualities of effected things when the latter are refunded into their
causes--as when golden ornaments, for instance, are melted

<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span>

and thereby become simple gold again--do not continue to exist in those
causes.--Here also the argumentation is specially directed against the
Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, who, in order to account for the materiality and the
various imperfections of the world, think it necessary to assume a
causal substance participating in the same characteristics.

Adhik. IV (12) points out that the line of reasoning followed in the
preceding adhikara*n*a is valid also against other theories, such as the
atomistic doctrine.

The one Sûtra (13) constituting Adhik. V teaches, according to
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, that although the enjoying souls as well as the
objects of fruition are in reality nothing but Brahman, and on that
account identical, yet the two sets may practically be held apart, just
as in ordinary life we hold apart, and distinguish as separate
individual things, the waves, ripples, and foam of the sea, although at
the bottom waves, ripples, and foam are all of them identical as being
neither more nor less than sea-water.--The *S*rî-bhâshya gives a totally
different interpretation of the Sûtra, according to which the latter has
nothing whatever to do with the eventual non-distinction of enjoying
souls and objects to be enjoyed. Translated according to Râmânu*g*a's
view, the Sûtra runs as follows: 'If non-distinction (of the Lord and
the individual souls) is said to result from the circumstance of (the
Lord himself) becoming an enjoyer (a soul), we refute this objection by
instances from every-day experience.' That is to say: If it be
maintained that from our doctrine previously expounded, according to
which this world springs from the Lord and constitutes his body, it
follows that the Lord, as an embodied being, is not essentially
different from other souls, and subject to fruition as they are; we
reply that the Lord's having a body does not involve his being subject
to fruition, not any more than in ordinary life a king, although himself
an embodied being, is affected by the experiences of pleasure and pain
which his servants have to undergo.--The construction which Râmânu*g*a
puts on the Sûtra is not repugnant either to the words of the Sutra or
to the context in which the latter stands, and that it rests on earlier
authority appears

<span id="page_xlix">p. xlix</span>

from a quotation made by Râmânu*g*a from the Drami*d*abhâshyakâra <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md).

Adhik. VI (14-20) treats of the non-difference of the effect from the
cause; a Vedânta doctrine which is defended by its adherents against the
Vai*s*eshikas according to whom the effect is something different from
the cause.--The divergent views of *S*a<u>n</u>kara and Râmânu*g*a on
this important point have been sufficiently illustrated in the general
sketch of the two systems.

Adhik. VII (21-23) refutes the objection that, from the Vedic passages
insisting on the identity of the Lord and the individual soul, it
follows that the Lord must be like the individual soul the cause of
evil, and that hence the entire doctrine of an all-powerful and all-wise
Lord being the cause of the world has to be rejected. For, the
Sûtra-kâra remarks, the creative principle of the world is additional
to, i.e. other than, the individual soul, the difference of the two
being distinctly declared by Scripture.--The way in which the three
Sûtras constituting this adhikara*n*a are treated by *S*a<u>n</u>kara on
the one hand and Râmânu*g*a on the other is characteristic. Râmânu*g*a
throughout simply follows the words of the Sûtras, of which Sûtra 21
formulates the objection based on such texts as 'Thou art that,' while
Sûtra 22 replies that Brahman is different from the soul, since that is
expressly declared by Scripture. *S*a<u>n</u>kara, on the other hand,
sees himself obliged to add that the difference of the two, plainly
maintained in Sûtra 22, is not real, but due to the soul's fictitious
limiting adjuncts.

Adhik. VIII (24, 25) shows that Brahman, although destitute of material
and instruments of action, may yet produce the world, just as gods by
their mere power create

<span id="page_l">p. l</span>

palaces, animals, and the like, and as milk by itself turns into curds.

Adhik. IX (26-29) explains that, according to the express doctrine of
Scripture, Brahman does not in its entirety pass over into the world,
and, although emitting the world from itself, yet remains one and
undivided. This is possible, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, because the
world is unreal; according to Râmânu*g*a, because the creation is merely
the visible and tangible manifestation of what previously existed in
Brahman in a subtle imperceptible condition.

Adhik. X (30, 31) teaches that Brahman, although destitute of
instruments of action, is enabled to create the world by means of the
manifold powers which it possesses.

Adhik. XI (32, 33) assigns the motive of the creation, or, more properly
expressed, teaches that Brahman, in creating the world, has no motive in
the strict sense of the word, but follows a mere sportive impulse.

Adhik. XII (34-36) justifies Brahman from the charges of partiality and
cruelty which might be brought against it owing to the inequality of
position and fate of the various animate beings, and the universal
suffering of the world. Brahman, as a creator and dispenser, acts with a
view to the merit and demerit of the individual souls, and has so acted
from all eternity.

Adhik. XIII (37) sums up the preceding argumentation by declaring that
all the qualities of Brahman--omniscience and so on--are such as to
capacitate it for the creation of the world.

### PÂDA II.

The task of the second pâda is to refute, by arguments independent of
Vedic passages, the more important philosophical theories concerning the
origin of the world which are opposed to the Vedânta view.--The first
adhikara*n*a (1-10) is directed against the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, whose
doctrine had already been touched upon incidentally in several previous
places, and aims at proving that a non-intelligent first cause, such as
the pradhâna of the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, is unable to create and
dispose.--The second adhikara*n*a (11-17) refutes the

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vai*s*eshika tenet
that the world originates from atoms set in motion by the
ad*ri*sh*t*a.--The third and fourth adhikara*n*as are directed against
various schools of Bauddha philosophers. Adhik. III (18-27) impugns the
view of the so-called sarvâstitvavâdins, or bâhyârthavâdins, who
maintain the reality of an external as well as an internal world; Adhik.
IV (28-32) is directed against the vi*gñ*ânavâdins, according to whom
ideas are the only reality.--The last Sûtra of this adhikara*n*a is
treated by Râmânu*g*a as a separate adhikara*n*a refuting the view of
the Mâdhyamikas, who teach that everything is void, i.e. that nothing
whatever is real.--Adhik. V (33-36) is directed against the doctrine of
the *G*ainas; Adhik. VI (37-41) against those philosophical schools
which teach that a highest Lord is not the material but only the
operative cause of the world.

The last adhikara*n*a of the pâda (42-45) refers, according to the
unanimous statement of the commentators, to the doctrine of the
Bhâgavatas or Pâ*ñk*arâtras. But *S*a<u>n</u>kara and Râmânu*g*a totally
disagree as to the drift of the Sûtrakâra's opinion regarding that
system. According to the former it is condemned like the systems
previously referred to; according to the latter it is approved
of.--Sûtras 42 and 43, according to both commentators, raise objections
against the system; Sûtra 42 being directed against the doctrine that
from the highest being, called Vâsudeva, there is originated
Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a, i.e. the *g*îva, on the ground that thereby those
scriptural passages would be contradicted which teach the soul's
eternity; and Sûtra 43 impugning the doctrine that from
Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a there springs Pradyumna, i. e. the manas.--The
Sûtra on which the difference of interpretation turns is 44. Literally
translated it runs, 'Or, on account of there being' (or, 'their being')
'knowledge and so on, there is non-contradiction of that.'--This means,
according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, 'Or, if in consequence of the existence
of knowledge and so on (on the part of Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a, &c. they be
taken not as soul, mind, &c. but as Lords of pre-eminent knowledge,
&c.), yet there is non-contradiction of that (viz. of the objection
raised in Sûtra 42 against the Bhâgavata doctrine).'--

<span id="page_lii">p. lii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> According to
Râmânu*g*a, on the other hand, the Sûtra has to be explained as follows:
'Or, rather there is non-contradiction of that (i.e. the Pa*ñk*arâtra
doctrine) on account of their being knowledge and so on (i. e. on
account of their being Brahman).' Which means: Since
Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a and so on are merely forms of manifestation of
Brahman, the Pâ*ñk*arâtra doctrine, according to which they spring from
Brahman, is not contradicted.--The form of the Sûtra makes it difficult
for us to decide which of the two interpretations is the right one; it,
however, appears to me that the explanations of the 'vâ' and of the
'tat,' implied in Râmânu*g*a's comment, are more natural than those
resulting from *S*a<u>n</u>kara's interpretation. Nor would it be an
unnatural proceeding to close the polemical pâda with a defence of that
doctrine which--in spite of objections--has to be viewed as the true
one.

### PÂDA III.

The third pâda discusses the question whether the different forms of
existence which, in their totality, constitute the world have an origin
or not, i. e. whether they are co-eternal with Brahman, or issue from it
and are refunded into it at stated intervals.

The first seven adhikara*n*as treat of the five elementary
substances.--Adhik. I (1-7) teaches that the ether is not co-eternal
with Brahman, but springs from it as its first effect.--Adhik. II (8)
shows that air springs from ether; Adhik. IV, V, VI (10; 11; 12) that
fire springs from air, water from fire, earth from water.--Adhik. III
(9) explains by way of digression that Brahman, which is not some
special entity, but quite generally 'that which is,' cannot have
originated from anything else.

Adhik. VII (13) demonstrates that the origination of one element from
another is due, not to the latter in itself, but to Brahman acting in
it.

Adhik. VIII (14) teaches that the reabsorption of the elements into
Brahman takes place in the inverse order of their emission.

Adhik. IX (15) remarks that the indicated order in which

<span id="page_liii">p. liii</span>

the emission and the reabsorption of the elementary substances take
place is not interfered with by the creation and reabsorption of the
organs of the soul, i.e. the sense organs and the internal organ
(manas); for they also are of elemental nature, and as such created and
retracted together with the elements of which they consist.

The remainder of the pâda is taken up by a discussion of the nature of
the individual soul, the *g*îva.--Adhik. X (16) teaches that expressions
such as 'Devadatta is born,' 'Devadatta has died,' strictly apply to the
body only, and are transferred to the soul in so far only as it is
connected with a body.

Adhik. XI (17) teaches that the individual soul is, according to
Scripture, permanent, eternal, and therefore not, like the ether and the
other elements, produced from Brahman at the time of creation.--This
Sûtra is of course commented on in a very different manner by
*S*a<u>n</u>kara on the one hand and Râmânu*g*a on the other. According
to the former, the *g*îva is in reality identical--and as such
co-eternal--with Brahman; what originates is merely the soul's connexion
with its limiting adjuncts, and that connexion is moreover
illusory.--According to Râmânu*g*a, the *g*îva is indeed an effect of
Brahman, but has existed in Brahman from all eternity as an individual
being and as a mode (prakâra) of Brahman. So indeed have also the
material elements; yet there is an important distinction owing to which
the elements may be said to originate at the time of creation, while the
same cannot be said of the soul. Previously to creation the material
elements exist in a subtle condition in which they possess none of the
qualities that later on render them the objects of ordinary experience;
hence, when passing over into the gross state at the time of creation,
they may be said to originate. The souls, on the other hand, possess at
all times the same essential qualities, i.e. they are cognizing agents;
only, whenever a new creation takes place, they associate themselves
with bodies, and their intelligence therewith undergoes a certain
expansion or development (vikâsa); contrasting with the unevolved or
contracted state (sa<u>n</u>ko*k*a)

<span id="page_liv">p. liv</span>

which characterised it during the preceding pralaya. But this change is
not a change of essential nature (svarûpânyathâbhâva) and hence we have
to distinguish the souls as permanent entities from the material
elements which at the time of each creation and reabsorption change
their essential characteristics.

Adhik. XII (18) defines the nature of the individual soul. The Sûtra
declares that the soul is '*gñ*a.' This means, according to
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, that intelligence or knowledge does not, as the
Vai*s*eshikas teach, constitute a mere attribute of the soul which in
itself is essentially non-intelligent, but is the very essence of the
soul. The soul is not a knower, but knowledge; not intelligent, but
intelligence.--Râmânu*g*a, on the other hand, explains '*gñ*a' by
'*gñ*at*ri*,' i.e. knower, knowing agent, and considers the Sûtra to be
directed not only against the Vai*s*eshikas, but also against those
philosophers who--like the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas and the Vedântins of
*S*a<u>n</u>kara's school--maintain that the soul is not a knowing
agent, but pure *k*aitanya.--The wording of the Sûtra certainly seems to
favour Râmânu*g*a's interpretation; we can hardly imagine that an author
definitely holding the views of *S*a<u>n</u>kara should, when
propounding the important dogma of the soul's nature, use the term *gñ*a
of which the most obvious interpretation *gñ*ât*ri*, not *gñ*ânam.

Adhik. XIII (19-32) treats the question whether the individual soul is
a*n*u, i. e. of very minute size, or omnipresent, all-pervading
(sarvagata, vyâpin). Here, again, we meet with diametrically opposite
views.--In *S*a<u>n</u>kara's opinion the Sûtras 19-38 represent the
pûrvapaksha view, according to which the *g*îva is a*n*u, while Sûtra 29
formulates the siddhânta, viz. that the *g*îva, which in reality is
all-pervading, is spoken of as a*n*u in some scriptural passages,
because the qualities of the internal organ--which itself is
a*n*u--constitute the essence of the individual soul as long as the
latter is implicated in the sa*m*sâra.--According to Râmânu*g*a, on the
other hand, the first Sûtra of the adhikara*n*a gives utterance to the
siddhânta view, according to which the soul is of minute size; the
Sûtras 20-25 confirm this view and refute objections raised against it;
while the

<span id="page_lv">p. lv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sûtras 26-29
resume the question already mooted under Sûtra 18, viz. in what relation
the soul as knowing agent (*gñ*ât*ri*) stands to knowledge
(*gñ*âna).--In order to decide between the conflicting claims of these
two interpretations we must enter into some details.--*S*a<u>n</u>kara
maintains that Sûtras 19-28 state and enforce a pûrvapaksha view, which
is finally refuted in 29. What here strikes us at the outset, is the
unusual length to which the defence of a mere primâ facie view is
carried; in no other place the Sûtras take so much trouble to render
plausible what is meant to be rejected in the end, and an unbiassed
reader will certainly feel inclined to think that in 19-28 we have to
do, not with the preliminary statement of a view finally to be
abandoned, but with an elaborate bonâ fide attempt to establish and
vindicate an essential dogma of the system. Still it is not altogether
impossible that the pûrvapaksha should here be treated at greater length
than usual, and the decisive point is therefore whether we can, with
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, look upon Sûtra 29 as embodying a refutation of the
pûrvapaksha and thus implicitly acknowledging the doctrine that the
individual soul is all-pervading. Now I think there can be no doubt that
*S*a<u>n</u>kara's interpretation of the Sûtra is exceedingly forced.
Literally translated (and leaving out the non-essential word
'prâ*gñ*avat') the Sûtra runs as follows: 'But on account of that
quality (or "those qualities;" or else "on account of the quality--or
qualities--of that") being the essence, (there is) that designation (or
"the designation of that").' This *S*a<u>n</u>kara maintains to mean,
'Because the qualities of the buddhi are the essence of the soul in the
sa*m*sâra state, therefore the soul itself is sometimes spoken of as
a*n*u.' Now, in the first place, nothing in the context warrants the
explanation of the first 'tat' by buddhi. And--which is more
important--in the second place, it is more than doubtful whether on
*S*a<u>n</u>kara's own system the qualities of the buddhi--such as
pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, &c.--can with any propriety be said to
constitute the essence of the soul even in the sa*m*sâra state. The
essence of the soul in whatever state, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara's
system, is knowledge or intelligence; whatever is due to its

<span id="page_lvi">p. lvi</span>

association with the buddhi is non-essential or, more strictly, unreal,
false.

There are no similar difficulties in the way of Râmânu*g*a's
interpretation of the adhikara*n*a. He agrees with *S*a<u>n</u>kara in
the explanation of Sûtras 19-35, with this difference that he views them
as setting forth, not the pûrvapaksha, but the siddhânta. Sûtras 26-28
also are interpreted in a manner not very different from
*S*a<u>n</u>kara's, special stress being laid on the distinction made by
Scripture between knowledge as a mere quality and the soul as a knowing
agent, the substratum of knowledge. This discussion naturally gives rise
to the question how it is that Scripture in some places makes use of the
term vi*gñ*âna when meaning the individual soul. The answer is given in
Sûtra 29, 'The soul is designated as knowledge because it has that
quality for its essence,' i.e. because knowledge is the essential
characteristic quality of the soul, therefore the term 'knowledge' is
employed here and there to denote the soul itself. This latter
interpretation gives rise to no doubt whatever. It closely follows the
wording of the text and does not necessitate any forced supplementation.
The 'tu' of the Sûtra which, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, is meant to
discard the pûrvapaksha, serves on Râmânu*g*a's view to set aside a
previously-raised objection; an altogether legitimate assumption.

Of the three remaining Sûtras of the adhikara*n*a (30-32), 30 explains,
according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara, that the soul may be called a*n*u, since,
as long as it exists in the sa*m*sâra condition, it is connected with
the buddhi. According to Râmânu*g*a the Sûtra teaches that the soul may
be called vi*gñ*âna because the latter constitutes its essential quality
as long as it exists.--Sûtra 31 intimates, according to
*S*a<u>n</u>kara, that in the states of deep sleep, and so on, the soul
is potentially connected with the buddhi, while in the waking state that
connexion becomes actually manifest. The same Sûtra, according to
Râmânu*g*a, teaches that *gñ*ât*ri*tva is properly said to constitute
the soul's essential nature, although it is actually manifested in some
states of the soul only.--In Sûtra 32, finally, *S*a<u>n</u>kara sees a
statement of the

<span id="page_lvii">p. lvii</span>

doctrine that, unless the soul had the buddhi for its limiting adjunct,
it would either be permanently cognizing or permanently non-cognizing;
while, according to Râmânu*g*a, the Sûtra means that the soul would
either be permanently cognizing or permanently non-cognizing, if it were
pure knowledge and all-pervading (instead of being *gñ*ât*ri* and a*n*u,
as it is in reality).--The three Sûtras can be made to fit in with
either interpretation, although it must be noted that none of them
explicitly refers to the soul's connexion with the buddhi.

Adhik. XIV and XV (33-39; 40) refer to the kart*ri*tva of the *g*îva, i.
e. the question whether the soul is an agent. Sûtras 33-39 clearly say
that it is such. But as, according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara's system, this
cannot be the final view,--the soul being essentially non-active, and
all action belonging to the world of upâdhis,--he looks upon the next
following Sûtra (40) as constituting an adhikara*n*a by itself, and
teaching that the soul is an agent when connected with the instruments
of action, buddhi, &c., while it ceases to be so when dissociated from
them, 'just as the carpenter acts in both ways,' i.e. just as the
carpenter works as long as he wields his instruments, and rests after
having laid them aside.--Râmânu*g*a, perhaps more naturally, does not
separate Sûtra 40 from the preceding Sûtras, but interprets it as
follows: Activity is indeed an essential attribute of the soul; but
therefrom it does not follow that the soul is always actually active,
just as the carpenter, even when furnished with the requisite
instruments, may either work or not work, just as he pleases.

Adhik. XVI (41, 42) teaches that the soul in its activity is dependent
on the Lord who impels it with a view to its former actions.

Adhik. XVII (43-53) treats of the relation of the individual soul to
Brahman. Sûtra 43 declares that the individual soul is a part (a*ms*a)
of Brahman, and the following Sûtras show how that relation does not
involve either that Brahman is affected by the imperfections,
sufferings, &c. of the souls, or that one soul has to participate in the
experiences of other souls. The two commentators of course take entirely

<span id="page_lviii">p. lviii</span>

different views of the doctrine that the soul is a part of Brahman.
According to Râmânu*g*a the souls are in reality parts of Brahman <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md); according to *S*a<u>n</u>kara the
'a*ms*a' of the Sûtra must be understood to mean 'a*ms*a iva,' 'a part
as it were;' the one universal indivisible Brahman having no real parts,
but appearing to be divided owing to its limiting adjuncts.--One Sûtra
(50) in this adhikara*n*a calls for special notice. According to
*S*a<u>n</u>kara the words 'âbhâsa eva *k*a.' mean '(the soul is) a mere
reflection,' which, as the commentators remark, is a statement of the
so-called pratibimbavâda, i.e. the doctrine that the so-called
individual soul is nothing but the reflection of the Self in the buddhi;
while Sûtra 43 had propounded the so-called ava*kkh*edavâda, i.e. the
doctrine that the soul is the highest Self in so far as limited by its
adjuncts.--According to Râmânu*g*a the âbhâsa of the Sûtra has to be
taken in the

<span id="page_lix">p. lix</span>

sense of hetvâbhâsa, a fallacious argument, and the Sûtra is explained
as being directed against the reasoning of those Vedântins according to
whom the soul is Brahman in so far as limited by non-real adjuncts <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](sbe34005.htm#fn_19.md).

### PÂDA IV.

Adhik. I, II, III (1-4; 5-6; 7) teach that the prâ*n*as (by which
generic name are denoted the buddhîndriyas, karmen-driyas, and the
manas) spring from Brahman; are eleven in number; and are of minute size
(a*n*u).

Adhik. IV, V, VI (8; 9-12; 13) inform us also that the mukhya prâ*n*a,
i.e. the vital air, is produced from Brahman; that it is a principle
distinct from air in general and from the prâ*n*as discussed above; and
that it is minute (a*n*u).

Adhik. VII and VIII (14-16; 17-19) teach that the prâ*n*as are
superintended and guided in their activity by special divinities, and
that they are independent principles, not mere modifications of the
mukhya prâ*n*a.

Adhik. IX (20-22) declares that the evolution of names and forms (the
nâmarûpavyâkara*n*a) is the work, not of the individual soul, but of the
Lord
