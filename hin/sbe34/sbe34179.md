*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3\. If it be said (that the pradhâna moves) like milk or water, (we
reply that) there also (the motion is due to intelligence).

Well, the Sâ<u>n</u>khya resumes, listen then to the following
instances.--As non-sentient milk flows forth from its own nature merely
for the nourishment of the young animal, and as non-sentient water, from
its own nature, flows along for the benefit of mankind, so the pradhâna
also, although non-intelligent, may be supposed to move from its own
nature merely for the purpose of effecting the highest end of man.

This argumentation, we reply, is unsound again; for as the adherents of
both doctrines admit that motion is not observed in the case of merely
non-intelligent things such as chariots, &c., we infer that water and
milk also move only because they are directed by intelligent powers.
Scriptural passages, moreover (such as 'He who dwells in

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

the water and within the water, who rules the water within,' B*ri*. Up.
III, 7, 4; and, 'By the command of that Akshara, O Gârgî, some rivers
flow to the East,' &c., B*ri*. Up. III, 8, 9), declare that everything
in this world which flows is directed by the Lord. Hence the instances
of milk and water as belonging themselves to that class of cases which
prove our general principle <span id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_329.md) cannot
be used to show that the latter is too wide.--Moreover, the cow, which
is an intelligent being and loves her calf, makes her milk flow by her
wish to do so, and the milk is in addition drawn forth by the sucking of
the calf. Nor does water move either with absolute independence--for its
flow depends on the declivity of the soil and similar circumstances--or
independently of an intelligent principle, for we have shown that the
latter is present in all cases--If, finally, our opponent should point
to Sûtra II, 1, 24 as contradicting the present Sûtra, we remark that
there we have merely shown on the ground of ordinary experience that an
effect may take place in itself independently of any external
instrumental cause; a conclusion which does not contradict the doctrine,
based on Scripture, that all effects depend on the Lord.
