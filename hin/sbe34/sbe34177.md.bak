### SECOND PÂDA.

REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!

1\. That which is inferred (by the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, viz. the pradhâna)
cannot be the cause (of the world), on account of the orderly
arrangement (of the world) being impossible (on that hypothesis).

Although it is the object of this system to define the true meaning of
the Vedânta-texts and not, like the science of Logic, to establish or
refute some tenet by mere ratiocination, still it is incumbent on
thorough students of the Vedânta to refute the Sâ<u>n</u>khya and other
systems which are obstacles in the way of perfect knowledge. For this
purpose a new chapter is begun. (Nor must it be said that the refutation
of the other systems ought to have preceded the establishment of the
Vedânta position; for) as the determination of the sense of the
Vedânta-passages directly subserves perfect knowledge, we have at first,
by means of such a determination, established our own position, since
this is a task more important than the refutation of the views
entertained by others.

Here an opponent might come forward and say that we are indeed entitled
to establish our own position, so as to define perfect knowledge which
is the means of release to those desirous of it, but that no use is
apparent of a refutation of other opinions, a proceeding productive of
nothing but hate and anger.--There is a use, we reply. For there is some
danger of men of inferior intelligence looking upon the Sâ<u>n</u>khya
and similar systems as requisite for perfect knowledge, because those
systems have a weighty appearance, have been adopted by authoritative
persons, and profess to lead to perfect knowledge. Such people might
therefore think that those systems with their abstruse arguments

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

were propounded by omniscient sages, and might on that account have
faith in them. For this reason we must endeavour to demonstrate their
intrinsic worthlessness.

But, it might be said, the Sâ<u>n</u>khya and similar systems have
already been impugned in several Sûtras of the first adhyâya (I, 1, 5,
18; I, 4, 28); why, then, controvert them again?--The task--we
reply--which we are now about to undertake differs from what we have
already accomplished. As the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas and other philosophers also
quote, in order to establish their own positions, the Vedânta-passages
and interpret them in such a manner as to make them agree with their own
systems, we have hitherto endeavoured to show that their interpretations
are altogether fallacious. Now, however, we are going to refute their
arguments in an independent manner, without any reference to the
Vedânta-texts.

The Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, to make a beginning with them, argue as
follows.--Just as jars, dishes, and other products which possess the
common quality of consisting of clay are seen to have for their cause
clay in general; so we must suppose that all the outward and inward
(i.e. inanimate and animate) effects which are endowed with the
characteristics of pleasure, pain, and dulness  <span
id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_318.md) have for their causes pleasure, pain,
and dulness in general. Pleasure, pain, and dulness in their generality
together constitute the threefold pradhâna. This pradhâna which is
non-intelligent evolves itself spontaneously into multiform
modifications  <span id="fr_319"></span>[2](#fn_319.md), in order thus to
effect the purposes (i.e. enjoyment, release, and so on) of the
intelligent soul.--The existence of the pradhâna is to be inferred from
other circumstances also, such as the limitation of all effects and the
like  <span id="fr_320"></span>[3](#fn_320.md).

Against this doctrine we argue as follows.--If you Sânkhyas base your
theory on parallel instances merely, we point

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

out that a non-intelligent thing which, without being guided by an
intelligent being, spontaneously produces effects capable of subserving
the purposes of some particular person is nowhere observed in the world.
We rather observe that houses, palaces, couches, pleasure-grounds, and
the like--things which according to circumstances are conducive to the
obtainment of pleasure or the avoidance of pain--are made by workmen
endowed with intelligence. Now look at this entire world which appears,
on the one hand, as external (i. e. inanimate) in the form of earth and
the other elements enabling (the souls) to enjoy the fruits of their
various actions, and, on the other hand, as animate, in the form of
bodies which belong to the different classes of beings, possess a
definite arrangement of organs, and are therefore capable of
constituting the abodes of fruition; look, we say, at this world, of
which the most ingenious workmen cannot even form a conception in their
minds, and then say if a non-intelligent principle like the pradhâna is
able to fashion it! Other non-intelligent things such as stones and
clods of earth are certainly not seen to possess analogous powers. We
rather must assume that just as clay and similar substances are seen to
fashion themselves into various forms, if worked upon by potters and the
like, so the pradhâna also (when modifying itself into its effects) is
ruled by some intelligent principle. When endeavouring to determine the
nature of the primal cause (of the world), there is no need for us to
take our stand on those attributes only which form part of the nature of
material causes such as clay, &c., and not on those also which belong to
extraneous agents such as potters, &c.  <span
id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_321) Nor (if remembering this latter point.md)
do we enter into conflict with any means of right knowledge; we, on the
contrary, are in direct agreement with Scripture which teaches that an
intelligent

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

cause exists.--For the reason detailed in the above, i.e. on account of
the impossibility of the 'orderly arrangement' (of the world), a
non-intelligent cause of the world is not to be inferred.--The word
'and' (in the Sutra) adds other reasons on account of which the pradhâna
cannot be inferred, viz. 'on account of the non-possibility of
endowment,' &c. For it cannot be maintained <span
id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_322.md) that all outward and inward effects are
'endowed' with the nature of pleasure, pain, and dulness, because
pleasure, &c. are known as inward (mental) states, while sound, &c. (i.
e. the sense-objects) are known as being of a different nature (i. e. as
outward things), and moreover as being the operative causes of pleasure,
&c. <span id="fr_323"></span>[2](#fn_323.md) And, further, although the
sense-object such as sound and so on is one, yet we observe that owing
to the difference of the mental impressions (produced by it) differences
exist in the effects it produces, one person being affected by it
pleasantly, another painfully, and so on <span
id="fr_324"></span>[3](#fn_324.md).--(Turning to the next Sâ<u>n</u>khya
argument which infers the existence of the pradhâna from the limitation
of all effects), we remark that he who concludes that all inward and
outward effects depend on a conjunction of several things, because they
are limited (a conclusion based on the observation that some limited
effects such as roof and sprout, &c. depend on the conjunction of
several things), is driven to the conclusion that the three constituents
of the pradhâna, viz. Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, likewise depend
on the conjunction of several

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

antecedents <span id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_325.md); for they also are
limited <span id="fr_326"></span>[2](#fn_326.md).--Further <span
id="fr_327"></span>[3](#fn_327.md), it is impossible to use the relation of
cause and effect as a reason for assuming that all effects whatever have
a non-intelligent principle for their antecedent; for we have shown
already that that relation exists in the case of couches and chairs
also, over whose production intelligence presides.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[364:3](sbe34177.htm#fr_320.md) The arguments here
referred to are enumerated in the Sâ. Kâ. 15; Sâ. Sûtras I, 129 ff.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[365:1](sbe34177.htm#fr_321.md) If we attempt to
infer the nature of the universal cause from its effects on the ground
of parallel instances, as, for instance, that of an earthen jar whose
material cause is clay, we must remember that the jar has sprung from
clay not without the co-operation of an intelligent being, viz. the
potter.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[366:1](sbe34177.htm#fr_322.md) As had been
asserted above for the purpose of inferring therefrom, according to the
principle of the equality of cause and effect, the existence of the
three constituents of the pradhâna.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[366:2](sbe34177.htm#fr_323.md) And a thing cannot
consist of that of which it is the cause.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[366:3](sbe34177.htm#fr_324.md) Which differences
cannot be reconciled with the Sâ<u>n</u>khya hypothesis of the object
itself consisting of either pleasure or pain, &c.--'If things consisted
in themselves of pleasure, pain, &c., then sandal ointment (which is
cooling, and on that account pleasant in summer) would be pleasant in
winter also; for sandal never is anything but sandal.--And as thistles
never are anything but thistles they ought, on the Sâ<u>n</u>khya
hypothesis, to be eaten with enjoyment not only by camels but by men
also.' Bhâ.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[367:2](sbe34177.htm#fr_326.md) For they limit one
another.

argument 'from the separateness of cause and effect' (Sâ. Kâ. 15).
