<p>12. Thereby those (theories) also which are not accepted by competent persons are explained.</p> 
<p>Hitherto we have refuted those objections against the Ved&acirc;nta-texts which, based on reasoning, take their stand on the doctrine of the pradh&acirc;na being the cause of the world; (which doctrine deserves to be refuted first), because it stands near to our Vedic system, is supported by somewhat weighty arguments, and has, to a certain extent, been adopted by some authorities who follow the Veda.--But now some dull-witted persons might think that another objection founded on reasoning might be raised against the Ved&acirc;nta, viz. on the ground of the atomic doctrine. The S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra, therefore, extends to the latter objection the refutation of the former, considering that by the conquest of the most dangerous adversary the conquest of the minor enemies is already virtually accomplished.

<p>either Manu or Vy&acirc;sa or other authorities, are to be considered as 'explained,' i.e. refuted by the same reasons which enabled us to dispose of the pradh&acirc;na doctrine. As the reasons on which the refutation hinges are the same, there is no room for further doubt. Such common arguments are the impotence of reasoning to fathom the depth of the transcendental cause of the world, the ill-foundedness of mere Reasoning, the impossibility of final release, even in case of the conclusions being shaped 'otherwise' (see the preceding S&ucirc;tra), the conflict of Scripture and Reasoning, and so on.</p>
