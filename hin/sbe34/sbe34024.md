18\. And on account of desire (being mentioned as belonging to the
ânandamaya) no regard is to be had to what is inferred, (i.e. to the
pradhâna inferred by the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas.)

Since in the passage 'he desired, may I be many, may I grow forth,'
which occurs in the chapter treating of the ânandamaya (Taitt. Up. II,
6), the quality of feeling desire is mentioned, that which is inferred,
i.e. the non-intelligent pradhâna assumed by the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, cannot
be regarded as being the Self consisting of bliss and the cause of the
world. Although the opinion that the pradhâna is the

cause of the world, has already been refuted in the Sûtra I, 1, 5, it is
here, where a favourable opportunity presents itself, refuted for a
second time on the basis of the scriptural passage about the cause of
the world feeling desire, for the purpose of showing the uniformity of
view (of all scriptural passages).
