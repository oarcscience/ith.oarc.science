### THIRD PÂDA.

REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!

1\. The abode of heaven, earth, and so on (is Brahman), on account of
the term 'own,' i.e. Self.

We read (Mu. Up. II, 2, 5), 'He in whom the heaven, the earth, and the
sky are woven, the mind also with all the vital airs, know him alone as
the Self, and leave off other words! He is the bridge of the
Immortal.'--Here the doubt arises whether the abode which is intimated
by the statement of the heaven and so on being woven in it is the
highest Brahman or something else.

The pûrvapakshin maintains that the abode is something else, on account
of the expression, 'It is the bridge of the Immortal.' For, he says, it
is known from every-day experience that a bridge presupposes some
further bank to which it leads, while it is impossible to assume
something further beyond the highest Brahman, which in Scripture is
called 'endless, without a further shore' (B*ri*. Up. II, 4, 12). Now if
the abode is supposed to be something different from Brahman, it must be
supposed to be either the pradhâna known from Sm*ri*ti, which, as being
the (general) cause, may be called the (general) abode; or the air known
from *S*ruti, of which it is said (B*ri*. Up. III, 7, 2, 'Air is that
thread, O Gautama. By air as by a thread, O Gautama, this world and the
other world and all beings are strung together'), that it supports all
things; or else the embodied soul which, as being the enjoyer, may be
considered as an abode with reference to the objects of its fruition.

Against this view we argue with the sûtrakâra as follows:--'Of the world
consisting of heaven, earth, and so on, which in the quoted passage is
spoken of as woven (upon something), the highest Brahman must be the
abode.'--Why?--On account of the word 'own,' i.e. on account of the word
'Self.' For we meet with the word 'Self' in the passage, 'Know him alone
as the Self.' This term 'Self' is

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

thoroughly appropriate only if we understand the highest Self and not
anything else.--(To propound another interpretation of the phrase
'sva*s*abdât' employed in the Sûtra.) Sometimes also Brahman is spoken
of in *S*ruti as the general abode by its own terms (i.e. by terms
properly designating Brahman), as, for instance (*Kh.* Up. VI. 8, 4),
'All these creatures, my dear, have their root in the being, their abode
in the being, their rest in the being <span
id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_168.md).'--(Or else we have to explain
'sva*s*abdena' as follows), In the passages preceding and following the
passage under discussion Brahman is glorified with its own names <span
id="fr_169"></span>[2](#fn_169.md); cp. Mu. Up. II, 1, 10, 'The Person is
all this, sacrifice, penance, Brahman, the highest Immortal,' and II, 2,
11, 'That immortal Brahman is before, is behind, Brahman is to the right
and left.' Here, on account of mention being made of an abode and that
which abides, and on account of the co-ordination expressed in the
passage, 'Brahman is all' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11), a suspicion might arise
that Brahman is of a manifold variegated nature, just as in the case of
a tree consisting of different parts we distinguish branches, stem, and
root. In order to remove this suspicion the text declares (in the
passage under discussion), 'Know him alone as the Self.' The sense of
which is: The Self is not to be known as manifold, qualified by the
universe of effects; you are rather to dissolve by true knowledge the
universe of effects, which is the mere product of Nescience, and to know
that one Self, which is the general abode, as uniform. Just as when
somebody says, 'Bring that on which Devadatta sits,' the person
addressed brings the chair only (the abode of Devadatta), not Devadatta
himself; so the passage, 'Know him alone as the Self,' teaches that the
object to be known is the one uniform Self which constitutes the general
abode. Similarly another scriptural passage reproves him who believes in
the unreal world of effects,

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'From death to
death goes he who sees any difference here'(Ka. Up. II, 4, 11). The
statement of co-ordination made in the clause 'All is Brahman' aims at
dissolving (the wrong conception of the reality of) the world, and not
in any way at intimating that Brahman is multiform in nature <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md); for the uniformity (of Brahman's
nature) is expressly stated in other passages such as the following one,
'As a mass of salt has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a
mass of taste, thus indeed has that Self neither inside nor outside, but
is altogether a mass of knowledge' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 5, 13).--For all
these reasons the abode of heaven, earth, &c. is the highest
Brahman.--Against the objection that on account of the text speaking of
a 'bridge,' and a bridge requiring a further bank, we have to understand
by the abode of heaven and earth something different from Brahman, we
remark that the word 'bridge' is meant to intimate only that that which
is called a bridge supports, not that it has a further bank. We need not
assume by any means that the bridge meant is like an ordinary bridge
made of clay and wood. For as the word setu (bridge) is derived from the
root si, which means 'to bind,' the idea of holding together, supporting
is rather implied in it than the idea of being connected with something
beyond (a further bank).

According to the opinion of another (commentator) the word 'bridge' does
not glorify the abode of heaven, earth, &c., but rather the knowledge of
the Self which is glorified in the preceding clause, 'Know him alone as
the Self,' and the abandonment of speech advised in the clause, 'leave
off other words;' to them, as being the means of obtaining immortality,
the expression 'the bridge of the immortal' applies <span
id="fr_171"></span>[2](#fn_171.md). On that account we have to set aside
the assertion that, on account of the word 'bridge,' something different
from Brahman is to be understood by the abode of heaven, earth, and so
on.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_168"></span>[155:1](sbe34070.htm#fr_168.md) From passages of
which nature we may infer that in the passage under discussion also the
'abode' is Brahman.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[155:2](sbe34070.htm#fr_169.md) From which
circumstance we may conclude that the passage under discussion also
refers to Brahman.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[156:1](sbe34070.htm#fr_170.md) Yat sarvam
avidyâropita*m* tat sarva*m* paramârthato brahma na tu yad brahma tat
sarvam ity artha*h*. Bhâmatî.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[156:2](sbe34070.htm#fr_171.md) So that the
passage would have to be translated, 'That, viz. knowledge, &c. is the
bridge of the Immortal.'
