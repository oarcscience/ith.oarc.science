2\. But the subtle (body is meant by the term avyakta) on account of its
capability (of being so designated).

It has been asserted, under the preceding Sûtra, that the term 'the
Undeveloped' signifies, on account of the general

subject-matter and because the body only remains, the body and not the
pradhâna of the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas.--But here the following doubt arises:
How can the word 'undeveloped' appropriately denote the body which, as a
gross and clearly appearing thing, should rather be called vyakta, i.e.
that which is developed or manifested?

To this doubt the Sûtra replies that what the term avyakta denotes is
the subtle causal body. Anything subtle may be spoken of as Undeveloped.
The gross body indeed cannot directly be termed 'undeveloped,' but the
subtle parts of the elements from which the gross body originates may be
called so, and that the term denoting the causal substance is applied to
the effect also is a matter of common occurrence; compare, for instance,
the phrase 'mix the Soma with cows, i.e. milk' (*Ri*g-veda. S. IX, 46,
4). Another scriptural passage also--'now all this was then undeveloped'
(B*ri*. Up. I, 4, 7)--shows that this, i.e. this developed world with
its distinction of names and forms, is capable of being termed
undeveloped in so far as in a former condition it was in a merely
seminal or potential state, devoid of the later evolved distinctions of
name and form.
