*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

38\. And on account of the prohibition, in Sm*ri*ti, of (the *S*ûdras')
hearing and studying (the Veda) and (knowing and performing) (Vedic)
matters.

The *S*ûdras are not qualified for that reason also that Sm*ri*ti
prohibits their hearing the Veda, their studying the Veda, and their
understanding and performing Vedic matters. The prohibition of hearing
the Veda is conveyed by the following passages: 'The ears of him who
hears the Veda are to be filled with (molten) lead and lac,' and 'For a
*S*ûdra is (like) a cemetery, therefore (the Veda) is not to be read in
the vicinity of a *S*ûdra.' From this latter passage the prohibition of
studying the Veda results at once; for how should he study Scripture in
whose vicinity it is not even to be read? There is, moreover, an express
prohibition (of the *S*ûdras studying the Veda). 'His tongue is to be
slit if he pronounces it; his body is to be cut through if he preserves
it.' The prohibitions of hearing and studying the Veda already imply the
prohibition of the knowledge and performance of Vedic matters; there
are, however, express prohibitions also, such as 'he is not to impart
knowledge to the *S*ûdra,' and 'to the twice-born belong study,
sacrifice, and the bestowal of gifts.'--From those *S*ûdras, however,
who, like Vidura and 'the religious hunter,' acquire knowledge in
consequence of the after effects of former deeds, the fruit of their
knowledge cannot be withheld,

since knowledge in all cases brings about its fruit. Sm*ri*ti, moreover,
declares that all the four castes are qualified for acquiring the
knowledge of the itihâsas and purâ*n*as; compare the passage, 'He is to
teach the four castes' (Mahâbh.).--It remains, however, a settled point
that they do not possess any such qualification with regard to the Veda.
