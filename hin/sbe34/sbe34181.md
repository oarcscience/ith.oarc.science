5\. Nor (can it be said that the pradhâna modifies itself spontaneously)
like grass, &c. (which turn into milk); for (milk) does not exist
elsewhere (but in the female animal).

Let this be (the Sâ<u>n</u>khya resumes). Just as grass, herbs, water,
&c. independently of any other instrumental cause transform themselves,
by their own nature, into milk; so, we assume, the pradhâna also
transforms itself into the great principle, and so on. And, if you ask
how we know that grass transforms itself independently of any
instrumental cause; we reply, 'Because no such cause is observed.' For
if we did perceive some such cause, we certainly should apply it to
grass, &c. according to our liking, and thereby produce milk. But as a
matter of fact we do no such thing. Hence the transformation of grass
and the like must be considered to be due to its own nature merely; and
we may infer therefrom that the transformation of the pradhâna is of the
same kind.

To this we make the following reply.--The transformation of the pradhâna
might be ascribed to its own nature merely if we really could admit that
grass modifies itself in the manner stated by you; but we are unable to
admit that, since another instrumental cause is observed. How? 'Because
it does not exist elsewhere.' For grass becomes milk only when it is
eaten by a cow or some other female animal, not if it is left either
uneaten or is eaten by a bull. If the transformation had no special
cause, grass would become milk even on other conditions than that of
entering a cow's body. Nor would the circumstance of men not being able
to produce milk according to their liking prove that there is no
instrumental cause; for while some effects can be produced by men,
others result from divine action only  <span
id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_330). The fact, however, is that men also are
able, by

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

applying a means in their power, to produce milk from grass and herbs;
for when they wish to procure a more abundant supply of milk they feed
the cow more plentifully and thus obtain more milk from her.--For these
reasons the spontaneous modification of the pradhâna cannot be proved
from the instance of grass and the like.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_330"></span>[371:1](sbe34181.htm#fr_330) It might be held
that for the transformation of grass into milk no other cause is
required than the digestive heat of the cow's <span id="page_372">p.
372</span> body; but a reflecting person will acknowledge that there
also the omniscient Lord is active. Bhâ.
