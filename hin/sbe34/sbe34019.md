13\. If (it be objected that the term ânandamaya, consisting of bliss,
can) not (denote the highest Self) on account of its being a word
denoting a modification

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (or product); (we
declare the objection to be) not (valid) on account of abundance, (the
idea of which may be expressed by the affix maya.)

Here the pûrvapakshin raises the objection that the word ânandamaya
(consisting of bliss) cannot denote the highest Self.--Why?--Because the
word ânandamaya is understood to denote something different from the
original word (i.e. the word ânanda without the derivative affix maya),
viz. a modification; according to the received sense of the affix maya.
'Ânandamaya' therefore denotes a modification, just as annamaya
(consisting of food) and similar words do.

This objection is, however, not valid, because 'maya' is also used in
the sense of abundance, i.e. denotes that where there is abundance of
what the original word expresses. So, for instance, the phrase 'the
sacrifice is annamaya' means 'the sacrifice is abounding in food' (not
'is some modification or product of food'). Thus here Brahman also, as
abounding in bliss, is called ânandamaya. That Brahman does abound in
bliss follows from the passage (Taitt. Up. II, 8), where, after the
bliss of each of the different classes of beings, beginning with man,
has been declared to be a hundred times greater than the bliss of the
immediately preceding class, the bliss of Brahman is finally proclaimed
to be absolutely supreme. Maya therefore denotes abundance.
