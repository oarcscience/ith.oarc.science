*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

30\. The declaration (made by Indra about himself, viz. that he is one
with Brahman) (is possible) through intuition vouched for by Scripture,
as in the case of Vâmadeva.

The individual divine Self called Indra perceiving by means of
*ri*shi-like intuition <span id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135.md)--the
existence of which is vouched for by Scripture--its own Self to be
identical with the supreme Self, instructs Pratardana (about the highest
Self) by means of the words 'Know me only.'

By intuition of the same kind the *ri*shi Vâmadeva reached the knowledge
expressed in the words, 'I was Manu and Sûrya;' in accordance with the
passage, 'Whatever deva was awakened (so as to know Brahman) he indeed
became that' (B*ri*. Up. I, 4, 10). The assertion made above (in the
pûrvapaksha of the preceding Sûtra) that Indra after saying, 'Know me
only,' glorifies himself by enumerating the slaying of Tvash*tri*'s son
and other deeds of strength, we refute as follows. The death of
Tvash*tri*'s son and similar deeds are referred to, not to the end of
glorifying Indra as the object of knowledge--in which case the sense of
the passage would be, 'Because I accomplished such and such deeds,
therefore know me'--but to the end of glorifying the cognition of the
highest Self. For this reason the text, after having referred to the
slaying of Tvash*tri*'s son and the like, goes on in the clause next
following to exalt knowledge, 'And not one hair of me is harmed there.
He who knows me thus by no deed of his is his life harmed.'--(But how
does this passage convey praise of knowledge?)--Because, we reply, its
meaning is as follows: 'Although I do such cruel deeds,

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

yet not even a hair of mine is harmed because I am one with Brahman;
therefore the life of any other person also who knows me thus is not
harmed by any deed of his.' And the object of the knowledge (praised by
Indra) is nothing else but Brahman which is set forth in a subsequent
passage, 'I am prâ*n*a, the intelligent Self.' Therefore the entire
chapter refers to Brahman.
