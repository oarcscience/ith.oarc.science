17\. And as the (atomic theory) is not accepted (by any authoritative
persons) it is to be disregarded altogether.

While the theory of the pradhâna being the cause of the world has been
accepted by some adherents of the Veda--as, for instance, Manu--with a
view to the doctrines of the effect existing in the cause already, and
so on, the atomic doctrine has not been accepted by any persons of
authority in any of its parts, and therefore is to be disregarded
entirely by all those who take their stand on the Veda.

There are, moreover, other objections to the Vai*s*eshika doctrine.--The
Vai*s*eshikas assume six categories, which constitute the subject-matter
of their system, viz. substance, quality, action, generality,
particularity, and inherence. These six categories they maintain to be
absolutely different from each other, and to have different
characteristics;

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

just as a man, a horse, a hare differ from one another. Side by side
with this assumption they make another which contradicts the former one,
viz. that quality, action, &c. have the attribute of depending on
substance. But that is altogether inappropriate; for just as ordinary
things, such as animals, grass, trees, and the like, being absolutely
different from each other do not depend on each other, so the qualities,
&c. also being absolutely different from substance, cannot depend on the
latter. Or else let the qualities, &c. depend on substance; then it
follows that, as they are present where substance is present, and absent
where it is absent, substance only exists, and, according to its various
forms, becomes the object of different terms and conceptions (such as
quality, action, &c.); just as Devadatta, for instance, according to the
conditions in which he finds himself is the object of various
conceptions and names. But this latter alternative would involve the
acceptation of the Sâ<u>n</u>khya doctrine <span
id="fr_376"></span>[1](#fn_376.md) and the abandonment of the Vai*s*eshika
standpoint.--But (the Vai*s*eshika may say) smoke also is different from
fire and yet it is dependent on it.--True, we reply; but we ascertain
the difference of smoke and fire from the fact of their being
apperceived in separation. Substance and quality, on the other hand, are
not so apperceived; for when we are conscious of a white blanket, or a
red cow, or a blue lotus, the substance is in each case cognised by
means of the quality; the latter therefore has its Self in the
substance. The same reasoning applies to action, generality,
particularity, and inherence.

If you (the Vai*s*eshika) say that qualities, actions, &c. (although not
non-different from substances) may yet depend on the latter because
substances and qualities stand in the relation of one not being able to
exist without the other (ayutasiddhi <span
id="fr_377"></span>[2](#fn_377).md); we point out that things which are

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

ayutasiddha must either be non-separate in place, or non-separate in
time, or non-separate in nature, and that none of these alternatives
agrees with Vai*s*eshika principles. For the first alternative
contradicts your own assumptions according to which the cloth
originating from the threads occupies the place of the threads only, not
that of the cloth, while the qualities of the cloth, such as its white
colour, occupy the place of the cloth only, not that of the threads. So
the Vai*s*eshika-sûtras say (I, 1, 10), 'Substances originate another
substance and qualities another quality.' The threads which constitute
the causal substance originate the effected substance, viz. the cloth,
and the qualities of the threads, such as white colour, &c., produce in
the cloth new corresponding qualities. But this doctrine is clearly
contradicted by the assumption of substance and quality being
non-separate in place--If, in the second place, you explain
ayutasiddhatva as non-separation in time, it follows also that, for
instance, the right and the left horn of a cow would be
ayutasiddha.--And if, finally, you explain it to mean 'non-separation in
character,' it is impossible to make any further distinction between the
substance and the quality, as then quality is conceived as being
identical with substance.

Moreover, the distinction which the Vai*s*eshikas make between
conjunction (sa*m*yoga) as being the connexion of things which can exist
separately, and inherence (samavâya) as being the connexion of things
which are incapable of separate existence is futile, since the cause
which exists before the effect <span id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_378.md)
cannot be said to be incapable of separate existence. Perhaps the
Vai*s*eshika will say that his definition refers to one of the two terms
only, so that samavâya is the connexion, with the cause, of the effect
which is incapable of separate existence. But this also is of no avail;
for as a connexion requires two terms, the effect as long as it has not
yet entered into being cannot be connected with the cause. And it would
be equally unavailing to say that the effect enters into the connexion
after it has begun to exist; for if the Vai*s*eshika admits that the
effect

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

may exist previous to its connexion with the cause, it is no longer
ayutasiddha (incapable of separate existence), and thereby the principle
that between effect and cause conjunction and disjunction do not take
place is violated. <span id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_379.md) And  <span
id="fr_380"></span>[2](#fn_380.md) just as conjunction, and not samavâya,
is the connexion in which every effected substance as soon as it has
been produced stands with the all-pervading substances as ether,
&c.--although no motion has taken place on the part of the effected
substance--so also the connexion of the effect with the cause will be
conjunction merely, not samavâya.

Nor is there any proof for the existence of any connexion, samavâya or
sa*m*yoga, apart from the things which it connects. If it should be
maintained that sa*m*yoga and samavâya have such an existence because we
observe that there are names and ideas of them in addition to the names
and ideas of the things connected, we point out that one and the same
thing may be the subject of several names and ideas if it is considered
in its relations to what lies without it. Devadatta although being one
only forms the object of many different names and notions according as
he is considered in himself or in his relations to others; thus he is
thought and spoken of as man, Brâhma*n*a learned in the Veda, generous,
boy, young man, old man, father, son, grandson, brother, son-in-law. &c.
So, again, one and the same stroke is, according to the place it is
connected with, spoken of and conceived as meaning either ten, or
hundred, or thousand, &c. Analogously, two connected things are not only
conceived and denoted as connected things, but in addition constitute
the object of the ideas and terms 'conjunction' or 'inherence' which
however do not prove

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

themselves to be separate entities.--Things standing thus, the
non-existence of separate entities (conjunction, &c.), which entities
would have to be established on the ground of perception, follows from
the fact of their non- perception.

Nor, again  <span id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_381.md), does the circumstance
of the word and idea of connexion having for its object the things
connected involve the connexion's permanent existence, since we have
already shown above that one thing may, on account of its relations to
other things, be conceived and denoted in different ways.

Further  <span id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_382.md), conjunction cannot take
place between the atoms, the soul, and the internal organ, because they
have no parts; for we observe that conjunction takes place only of such
substances as consist of parts. If the Vai*s*eshika should say that
parts of the atoms, soul and mind may be assumed (in order to explain
their alleged conjunction), we remark that the assumption of actually
non-existing things would involve the result that anything might be
established; for there is no restrictive rule that only such and such
non-existing things--whether contradictory to reason or not--should be
assumed and not any other, and assumptions depend on one's choice only
and may be carried to any extent. If we once allow assumptions, there is
no reason why there should not be assumed a further hundred or thousand
things, in addition to the six categories assumed by the Vai*s*eshikas.
Anybody might then assume anything, and we could neither stop a
compassionate man from assuming that this transmigratory world which is
the cause of so much misery to living beings is not to be, nor a
malicious man from assuming that even the released souls are to enter on
a new cycle of existences.

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

Further, it is not possible that a binary atomic compound, which
consists of parts, should be connected with the simple indivisible atoms
by an intimate connexion (sa*ms*lesha) any more than they can thus be
connected with ether; for between ether and earth, &c. there does not
exist that kind of intimate connexion which exists, for instance,
between wood and varnish <span id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_383.md).

Let it then be said (the Vai*s*eshika resumes) that the samavâya
relation must be assumed, because otherwise the relation of that which
abides and that which forms the abode--which relation actually exists
between the effected substance and the causal substance--is not
possible.--That would, we reply, involve the vice of mutual dependence;
for only when the separateness of cause and effect is established, the
relation of the abode and that which abides can be established; and only
when the latter relation is established, the relation of separateness
can be established. For the Vedântins acknowledge neither the
separateness of cause and effect, nor their standing to each other in
the relation of abode and thing abiding, since according to their
doctrine the effect is only a certain state of the cause <span
id="fr_384"></span>[2](#fn_384.md).--Moreover, as the atoms are limited
(not of infinite extension), they must in reality consist of as many
parts as we acknowledge regions of space <span
id="fr_385"></span>[3](#fn_385.md), whether those be six or eight or ten,
and consequently they cannot be permanent; conclusions contrary to the
Vai*s*eshika doctrine of the indivisibility and permanency of the
atoms.--If the Vai*s*eshika replies that those very parts which are
owing to the existence of the different regions of space are his
(indestructible)

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

atoms; we deny that because all things whatever, forming a series of
substances of ever-increasing minuteness, are capable of dissolution,
until the highest cause (Brahman) is reached. Earth--which is, in
comparison with a binary compound, the grossest thing of all--undergoes
decomposition; so do the substances following next which belong to the
same class as earth; so does the binary compound; and so does, finally,
the atom which (although the minutest thing of all) still belongs to the
same general class (i.e. matter) with earth, &c. The objection (which
the Vai*s*eshika might possibly raise here again) that things can be
decomposed only by the separation of their parts  <span
id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_386.md), we have already disposed of above,
where we pointed out that decomposition may take place in a manner
analogous to the melting of ghee. Just as the hardness of ghee, gold,
and the like, is destroyed in consequence of those substances being
rendered liquid by their contact with fire, no separation of the parts
taking place all the while; so the solid shape of the atoms also may be
decomposed by their passing back into the indifferenced condition of the
highest cause. In the same way the origination of effects also is
brought about not merely in the way of conjunction of parts; for we see
that milk, for instance, and water originate effects such as sour milk
and ice without there taking place any conjunction of parts.

It thus appears that the atomic doctrine is supported by very weak
arguments only, is opposed to those scriptural passages which declare
the Lord to be the general cause, and is not accepted by any of the
authorities taking their stand on Scripture, such as Manu and others.
Hence it is to be altogether disregarded by highminded men who have a
regard for their own spiritual welfare.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[397:1](sbe34193.htm#fr_379.md) If the effect can
exist before having entered into connexion with the cause, the
subsequent connexion of the two is no longer samavâya but sa*m*yoga; and
that contradicts a fundamental Vai*s*eshika principle.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[397:2](sbe34193.htm#fr_380.md) This clause
replies to the objection that only those connexions which have been
produced by previous motion are to be considered conjunctions.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[398:1](sbe34193.htm#fr_381.md) A clause meant to
preclude the assumption that the permanent existence of the things
connected involves the permanent existence of the connexion.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[398:2](sbe34193.htm#fr_382.md) It having been
shown above that atoms cannot enter into sa*m*yoga with each other, it
is shown now that sa*m*yoga of the soul with the atoms cannot be the
cause of the motion of the latter, and that sa*m*yoga of soul and manas
cannot be the cause of cognition.

that case have a northern end, an eastern end, &c.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[400:1](sbe34193.htm#fr_386.md) And that on that
