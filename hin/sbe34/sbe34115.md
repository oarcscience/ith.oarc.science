4\. And (the pradhâna cannot be meant) because

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

there is no statement as to (the avyakta) being something to be
cognised.

The Sâ<u>n</u>khyas, moreover, represent the pradhâna as something to be
cognised in so far as they say that from the knowledge of the difference
of the constitutive elements of the pradhâna and of the soul there
results the desired isolation of the soul. For without a knowledge of
the nature of those constitutive elements it is impossible to cognise
the difference of the soul from them. And somewhere they teach that the
pradhâna is to be cognised by him who wishes to attain special
powers.--Now in the passage under discussion the avyakta is not
mentioned as an object of knowledge; we there meet with the mere word
avyakta, and there is no sentence intimating that the avyakta is to be
known or meditated upon. And it is impossible to maintain that a
knowledge of things which (knowledge) is not taught in the text is of
any advantage to man.--For this reason also we maintain that the word
avyakta cannot denote the pradhâna.--Our interpretation, on the other
hand, is unobjectionable, since according to it the passage mentions the
body (not as an object of knowledge, but merely) for the purpose of
throwing light on the highest place of Vish*n*u, in continuation of the
simile in which the body had been compared to a chariot.
