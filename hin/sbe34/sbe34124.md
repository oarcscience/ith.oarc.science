*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

13\. In the case of (the text of) some (the Kâ*n*vas) where food is not
mentioned, (the number five is made full) by the light (mentioned in the
preceding mantra).

The Kâ*n*va-text, although not mentioning food, makes up the full number
five, by the light mentioned in the mantra preceding that in which the
five-people are spoken of. That mantra describes the nature of Brahman
by saying, 'Him the gods worship as the light of lights.'--If it be
asked how it is accounted for that the light mentioned in both texts
equally is in one text to be employed for the explanation of the
five-people, and not in the other text; we reply that the reason lies in
the difference of the requirements. As the Mâdhyandinas meet in one and
the same mantra with breath and four other entities enabling them to
interpret the term, 'the five-people,' they are in no need of the light
mentioned in another mantra. The Kâ*n*vas, on the other hand, cannot do
without the light. The case is analogous to that of the
Sho*d*a*s*in-cup, which, according to different

passages, is either to be offered or not to be offered at the
atirâtra-sacrifice.

We have proved herewith that Scripture offers no basis for the doctrine
of the pradhâna. That this doctrine cannot be proved either by Sm*ri*ti
or by ratiocination will be shown later on.
