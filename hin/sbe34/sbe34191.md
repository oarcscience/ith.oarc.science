15\. And on account of the atoms having colour, &c., the reverse (of the
Vai*s*eshika tenet would take place); as thus it is observed.

Let us suppose, the Vai*s*eshikas say, all substances composed of parts
to be disintegrated into their parts; a limit will finally be reached
beyond which the process of disintegration cannot be continued. What
constitutes that limit are the atoms, which are eternal (permanent),
belong to four different classes, possess the qualities of colour, &c.,
and are the originating principles of this whole material world with its
colour, form, and other qualities.

This fundamental assumption of the Vai*s*eshikas we declare to be
groundless because from the circumstance of the atoms having colour and
other qualities there would follow the contrary of atomic minuteness and
permanency, i. e. it would follow that, compared to the ultimate cause,
they are gross and non-permanent. For ordinary experience teaches that
whatever things possess colour and other qualities are, compared to
their cause, gross and non-permanent. A piece of cloth, for instance, is
gross compared to the threads of which it consists, and non permanent;
and the threads again are non-permanent and gross compared

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

to the filaments of which they are made up. Therefore the atoms also
which the Vai*s*eshikas admit to have colour, &c. must have causes
compared to which they are gross and non-permanent. Hence that reason
also which Ka*n*âda gives for the permanence of the atoms (IV, 1, 1,
'that which exists without having a cause is permanent') does not apply
at all to the atoms because, as we have shown just now, the atoms are to
be considered as having a cause.--The second reason also which Ka*n*âda
brings forward for the permanency of the atoms, viz. in IV, 1, 4, 'the
special negation implied in the term non-eternal would not be
possible <span id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_372.md)' (if there did not exist
something eternal, viz. the atoms), does not necessarily prove the
permanency of the atoms; for supposing that there exists not any
permanent thing, the formation of a negative compound such as
'non-eternal' is impossible. Nor does the existence of the word
'non-permanent' absolutely presuppose the permanency of atoms; for there
exists (as we Vedântins maintain) another permanent ultimate Cause, viz.
Brahman. Nor can the existence of anything be established merely on the
ground of a word commonly being used in that sense, since there is room
for common use only if word and matter are well-established by some
other means of right knowledge.--The third reason also given in the
Vai*s*. Sûtras (IV, 1, 5) for the permanency of the atoms ('and
Nescience') is unavailing. For if we explain that Sûtra to mean 'the
non-perception of those actually existing causes whose effects are seen
is Nescience,' it would follow that the binary atomic compounds also are
permanent <span id="fr_373"></span>[2](#fn_373.md). And if we tried to
escape from that difficulty by including (in the explanation of the
Sûtra as given above) the qualification 'there being absence of
(originating) substances,'

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

then nothing else but the absence of a cause would furnish the reason
for the permanency of the atoms, and as that reason had already been
mentioned before (in IV, 1, 1) the Sûtra IV, 1, 5 would be a useless
restatement.--Well, then (the Vai*s*eshika might say), let us understand
by 'Nescience' (in the Sûtra) the impossibility of conceiving a third
reason of the destruction (of effects), in addition to the division of
the causal substance into its parts, and the destruction of the causal
substance; which impossibility involves the permanency of the
atoms <span id="fr_374"></span>[1](#fn_374.md).--There is no necessity, we
reply, for assuming that a thing when perishing must perish on account
of either of those two reasons. That assumption would indeed have to be
made if it were generally admitted that a new substance is produced only
by the conjunction of several causal substances. But if it is admitted
that a causal substance may originate a new substance by passing over
into a qualified state after having previously existed free from
qualifications, in its pure generality, it follows that the effected
substance may be destroyed by its solidity being dissolved, just as the
hardness of ghee is dissolved by the action of fire <span
id="fr_375"></span>[2](#fn_375.md).--Thus there would result, from the
circumstance of the atoms having colour, &c., the opposite of what the
Vai*s*eshikas mean. For this reason also the atomic doctrine cannot be
maintained.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_372"></span>[392:1](sbe34191.htm#fr_372.md) Our
Vai*s*eshika-sûtras read 'pratishedhabhâva*h*;' but as all MSS. of
Sa<u>n</u>kara have 'pratishedhâbhâva*h*' I have kept the latter reading
and translated according to Ânandagiri's explanation: Kâryam anityam iti
kârye vi*s*eshato nityatvanishedho na syâd yadi kâra*n*e\#py anityatvam
ato\#*n*ûnâ*m* kâra*n*ânâ*m* nityateti sûtrârtha*h*.

are not perceptible; the ternary aggregates, the so-called trasare*n*us,
constituting the minima perceptibilia.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[393:1](sbe34191.htm#fr_374.md) As they have no
cause which could either be disintegrated or destroyed.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[393:2](sbe34191.htm#fr_375.md) This according to
the Vedânta view. If atoms existed they might have originated from
avidyâ by a mere pari*n*âma and might again be dissolved into avidyâ,
without either disintegration or destruction of their cause taking
place.
