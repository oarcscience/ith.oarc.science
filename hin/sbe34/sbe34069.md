32\. Moreover they (the *G*âbâlas) speak of him

(the highest Lord) in that (i.e. the interstice between the top of the
head and the chin which is measured by a span).

Moreover the *G*âbâlas speak in their text of the highest Lord as being
in the interstice between the top of the head and the chin. 'The
unevolved infinite Self abides in the avimukta (i.e. the non-released
soul). Where does that avimukta abide? It abides in the Vara*n*â and the
Nâsî, in the middle. What is that Vara*n*â, what is that Nâsî?' The text
thereupon etymologises the term Vara*n*â as that which wards off
(vârayati) all evil done by the senses, and the term Nâsî as that which
destroys (nâ*s*ayati) all evil done by the senses; and then continues,
'And what is its place?--The place where the eyebrows and the nose join.
That is the joining place of the heavenly world (represented by the
upper part of the head) and of the other (i.e. the earthly world
represented by the chin).' (*G*âbâla Up. I.)--Thus it appears that the
scriptural statement which ascribes to the highest Lord the measure of a
span is appropriate. That the highest Lord is called abhivimâna refers
to his being the inward Self of all. As such he is directly measured,
i.e. known by all animate beings. Or else the word may be explained as
'he who is near everywhere--as the inward Self--and who at the same time
is measureless' (as being infinite). Or else it may denote the highest
Lord as him who, as the cause of the world, measures it out, i.e.
creates it. By all this it is proved that Vai*s*vânara is the highest
Lord.
