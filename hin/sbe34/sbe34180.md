4\. And because (the pradhâna), on account of there existing nothing
beyond it, stands in no relation; (it cannot be active.)

The three gu*n*as of the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas when in a state of equipoise
form the pradhâna. Beyond the pradhâna there exists no external
principle which could either impel the pradhâna to activity or restrain
it from activity. The soul (purusha), as we know, is indifferent,
neither moves to--nor restrains from--action. As therefore the pradhâna
stands in no relation, it is impossible to see why it should sometimes
modify itself into the great principle (mahat) and sometimes not. The
activity and non-activity (by turns) of the Lord,

on the other hand, are not contrary to reason, on account of his
omniscience and omnipotence, and his being connected with the power of
illusion (mâyâ).
