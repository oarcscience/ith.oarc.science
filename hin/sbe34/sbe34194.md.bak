*The Vedanta Sutras, commentary by Sankaracharya (SBE34)*, tr. by George
Thibaut \[1890\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

18\. (If there be assumed) the (dyad of) aggregates with its two causes,
(there takes place) non-establishment of those (two aggregates).

The reasons on account of which the doctrine of the

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vai*s*eshikas
cannot be accepted have been stated above. That doctrine may be called
semi-destructive (or semi-nihilistic  <span
id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_387).md). That the more thorough doctrine which
teaches universal non-permanency is even less worthy of being taken into
consideration, we now proceed to show.

That doctrine is presented in a variety of forms, due either to the
difference of the views (maintained by Buddha at different times), or
else to the difference of capacity on the part of the disciples (of
Buddha). Three principal opinions may, however, be distinguished; the
opinion of those who maintain the reality of everything (Realists,
sarvâstitvavâdin); the opinion of those who maintain that thought only
is real (Idealists, vi*gñ*ânavâdin); and the opinion of those who
maintain that everything is void (unreal; Nihilists, *s*ûnyavâdin <span
id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_388).md).--We first controvert those

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

who maintain that everything, external as well as internal, is real.
What is external is either element (bhûta) or elementary (bhautika);
what is internal is either mind (*k*itta) or mental (*k*aitta). The
elements are earth, water, and so on; elemental are colour, &c. on the
one hand, and the eye and the other sense-organs on the other hand.
Earth and the other three elements arise from the aggregation of the
four different kinds of atoms; the atoms of earth being hard, those of
water viscid, those of fire hot, those of air mobile.--The inward world
consists of the five so-called 'groups' (skandha), the group of
sensation (rûpaskandha), the group of knowledge (vi*gñ*ânaskandha), the
group of feeling (vedanâskandha), the group of verbal knowledge
(sam*gñ*âskandha), and the group of impressions
(sa*m*skâraskandha) <span id="fr_389"></span>[1](#fn_389.md); which

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

taken together constitute the basis of all personal existence  <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_390.md).

With reference to this doctrine we make the following remarks.--Those
two aggregates, constituting two different classes, and having two
different causes which the Bauddhas assume, viz. the aggregate of the
elements and elementary things whose cause the atoms are, and the
aggregate of the five skandhas whose cause the skandhas are, cannot, on
Bauddha principles, be established, i.e. it cannot be explained how the
aggregates are brought about. For the parts constituting the (material)
aggregates are devoid of intelligence, and the kindling (abhi*g*valana)
of intelligence depends on an aggregate of atoms having been brought
about previously <span id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_391.md). And the Bauddhas
do not admit any other permanent intelligent being, such as either an
enjoying soul or a ruling Lord, which could effect the aggregation of
the atoms. Nor can the atoms and skandhas be assumed to enter on
activity on their own account; for that would imply their never ceasing
to be active <span id="fr_392"></span>[3](#fn_392.md). Nor can the cause of
aggregation be looked for in the so-called abode (i.e. the
âlayavi*gñ*âna-pravâha, the train of self-cognitions); for the latter
must be described either as different from the single cognitions or as
not different from them. (In the former case it is either permanent, and
then it is nothing else but the permanent soul of the Vedântins; or
non-permanent;) then being admitted to be momentary merely, it cannot
exercise any influence and cannot therefore be the cause of the motion
of the atoms <span id="fr_393"></span>[4](#fn_393.md).

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (And in the latter
case we are not further advanced than before.)--For all these reasons
the formation of aggregates cannot be accounted for. But without
aggregates there would be an end of the stream of mundane existence
which presupposes those aggregates.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_387"></span>[401:1](sbe34194.htm#fr_387.md) Because according
to their opinion difference of size constitutes difference of substance,
so that the continuous change of size in animal bodies, for instance,
involves the continual perishing of old and the continual origination of
new substances.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[401:2](sbe34194.htm#fr_388.md) The following
notes on Bauddha doctrines are taken exclusively from the commentaries
on the *S*a<u>n</u>karabhâshya, and no attempt has been made to contrast
or reconcile the Brahminical accounts of Bauddha psychology with the
teaching of genuine Bauddha books. Cp. on the chief sects of the
Buddhistic philosophers the Bauddha chapter of the
Sarvadar*s*a*n*asa*m*graha.--The Nihilists are the Mâdhyamikas; the
Idealists are the Yogâ*k*âras; the Sautrântikas and the Vaibhâshikas
together constitute the class of the Realists.--I subjoin the account
given of those sects in the Brahmavidyâbhara*n*a.--Buddhasya hi

<span id="fn_389"></span>[402:1](sbe34194.htm#fr_389.md) The rûpaskandha
comprises the senses and their objects, colour, &c.; the sense-organs
were above called bhautika, they here re-appear as *k*aittika on account
of their connexion with thought. Their objects likewise are classed as
*k*aittika in so far as they are perceived by the senses.--The
vi*gñ*ânaskandha comprises the series of self-cognitions (ahamaham ity
âlayav*gñ*ânapravâha*h*), according to all commentators; and in
addition, according to the Brahmavidyâbhara*n*a, the knowledge,
determinate and indeterminate, of external things (savikalpaka*m*
nirvikalpaka*m* *k*a prav*ri*ttivi*gñ*ânasam*gñ*itam).--The
vedanâskandha comprises pleasure, pain, &c.--The sam*gñ*âskandha
comprises the cognition of things by their names (gaur a*s*va
ityâdi*s*abdasam*g*alpitapratyaya*h*, Ân. Gi.; gaur a*s*va ityeva*m*
nâmavi*s*ish*t*asavikalpaka*h* pratyaya*h*, Go. Ân.; sa*mgñ*â
ya*gñ*adattâdipadatadullekhî savikalpapratyayo vâ, dvitîyapakshe
vi*gñ*ânapadena savikalpapratyayo na grâhya*h*, Brahmavidyâbh.). The
sa*m*skâraskandha comprises passion, aversion, &c., dharma and
adharma.--Compare also the Bhâmatî.--The vi*gñ*ânaskandha is *k*itta,
the other skandhas *k*aitta.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[403:1](sbe34194.htm#fr_390.md) It has to be kept
in view that the sarvâstitvavâdins as well as the other Bauddha sects
teach the momentariness (ksha*n*ikatva), the eternal flux of everything
that exists, and are on that ground controverted by the upholders of the
permanent Brahman.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[403:2](sbe34194.htm#fr_391.md) Mind, on the
Bauddha doctrine, presupposes the existence of an aggregate of atoms,
viz. the body.

which no release could take place.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[403:4](sbe34194.htm#fr_393.md) The
Brahmavidyâbhara*n*a explains the last clause--from ksha*n*ikatvâ*k*
*k*a--somewhat differently: Api *k*a paramâ*n*ûnâm api
ksha*n*ikatvâbhyupagamân melana*m* na sambhavati, paramâ*n*ûnâ*m*
melana*m* paramâ*n*ukriyâdhînam, tathâ *k*a svakriyâ*m* prati

differently from the translation in the text.
