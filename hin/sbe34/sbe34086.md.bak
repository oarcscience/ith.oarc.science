17\. And on account of the settled meaning.

The small ether within cannot denote anything but the highest Lord for
this reason also, that the word 'ether' has (among other meanings) the
settled meaning of 'highest Lord.' Compare, for instance, the sense in
which the word 'ether' is used in *Kh*. Up. VIII, 14, 'He who is called
ether is the revealer of all forms and names;' and *Kh*. Up. I, 9, 1,
'All these beings take their rise from the ether,' &c. On the other
hand, we do not meet with any passage in which the word 'ether' is used
in the sense of 'individual soul.'--We have already shown that the word
cannot, in our passage, denote the elemental ether; for, although the
word certainly has that settled meaning, it cannot have it here, because
the elemental ether cannot possibly be compared to itself, &c. &c.
