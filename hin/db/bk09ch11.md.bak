1-3. The Devar<u>s</u>i Nârada said :-- O Thou, the foremost of the
knowers of the Vedas! I have heard the excellent narration of Earth. Now
I want to hear the anecdote of Gangâ. I heard, ere long, that Gangâ, of
the nature of Vi<u>sn</u>u and appearing from the feet of Vi<u>sn</u>u,
the Îs'varî of the Devas, appeared, due to the curse of Bhâratî, on
Bhârata; why has she come to Bhârata; in which Yuga and asked by whom
did she come to Bhârata? O Lord! Now describe to me this auspicious
anecdote capable to destroy sins and yield religious merits.

 

4-38. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Child! In ancient days there was born a
prosperous Emperor King of Kings, in the Solar dynasty. He had two
beautiful wives; one was named Vaidarbhî, and the other was named
S'aivyâ. S'aivyâ delivered a very lovely son; his name was Asamanjâ. On
the other hand, the queen Vaidarbhî desirous of getting a son,
worshipped S'ankara, the Lord of Bhûtas who became pleased and granted
her request; and Vaidarbhî became pregnant. After one hundred years of
pregnancy she gave birth to one mass of flesh. Seeing this, the queen
became very afflicted and taking refuge of Mahâdeva, began to cry loudly
and very often. Bhagavân S'ankara, then, appeared there in a
Brâhmi<u>n</u> form and cut that mass of flesh into thousand pieces.
Those thousand pieces turned out into thousand very powerful sons. Their
bodies looked more brillant than the mid-day sun. But they were all
burnt to ashes by the curse of Kapila Muni. And the King began to lament
bitterly and he entered into the forest. Asamajâ practised tapasyâ to
bring the Gangâ for one lakh years when he quitted his body in course of
time. His son Ams'umân practised tapasyâ for one lakh years to bring
Gangâ unto Bhârata and he, too, died. Then the son of Amsumân, the
intelligent Bhagîratha, a great devotee of Vi<u>sn</u>u, free of old age
and death and the store of many qualifications, practised tapasyâ for
one lakh years to bring Gangâ on earth. At last he saw S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a brilliant like ten millions of summer suns. He had two
hands; there was a flute in his hand; be was full of youth in the dress
of a cow-herd. A sight of His Gopâla Sundarî form, wearing a Sakhî's
dress, makes one think that He is ever ready to show grace on His
devotees. He is Para Brahmâ, whose Substance is Will; be has no
deficiencies. Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u and Mahes'vara and the other Devas
and Munis, etc. all praise Him, who pervades everywhere. He is not
concerned with anything; yet He is the Witness of all. He is beyond

the three gu<u>n</u>as, higher than Prakriti. A sweet smile is always in
his face, which makes it the more lovely. There is none equal to him in
showing Grace to the Bhaktas. His raiment is purified (uninflammable) by
fire and he is decorated with gems, jewels and ornaments. The King
Bhagîratha saw that unforeseen appearance, bowed down and began to
praise over and over again. His whole body was filled with ecstasy. Then
he clearly told what he wanted for the deliverance of his family.
Bhagavân S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a then, addressed Gangâ and said :-- “O
Sures'varî! Go quickly and appear in Bhârata, under the curse of
Bhâratî. By My command go quickly and purify the sons of Sagara. They
will all be purified by the touch of the air in contact with the Ganges
and rise up in divine aerial cars, assuming forms like Mine and they
will come to My abode. They will there remain always as My attendants
and they will not be involved in the sins that they committed in their
previous births. O Nârada! It is stated thus in the Vedas, that if the
human souls, taking their births in Bhârata, commit sins for millions
and millions of births, the sins will be completely destroyed if they
touch once the air in contact with and carrying the particles of the
Ganges. The sight of the Ganges and the touch of the Ganges water give
religious merits ten times more than the touch with the air in contact
with the Ganges water. People become freed of their sins then and there
especially if they bathe in the Ganges. It is heard in the S'rutis that
the bathing in the Ganges, if done according to rules, destroys all the
sins, e.g., the murder of a Brâhmi<u>n</u>, etc., acquired in one
thousand millions of births done consciously or unconsciously. The
merits that are acquired by the bathing in the Ganges on a day of
religious merit, cannot be described even by the Vedas. Whatever is
mentioned in the Âgamas is but a mere trifle. Even Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u
and Mahes'a cannot describe fully the merits of the bathing in the
Ganges. O Brâhmi<u>n</u>! Such is the glory of ordinary bathing. Now I
will describe the effect of the Ganges bath done with a Sankalpa
(resolve); hear. Ten times more the result is obtained when the Ganges
bathing is done with a resolve (Sankalpa) than ordinary bath and if one
bathes on the day when the sun passes from one sign to another (in the
Zodiac), thirty times more religious merits accrue. On the new Moon
(Amâvyas) day, the Ganges bath gives the merits as above mentioned; but
when the Sun is in his Southern course
(Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>âya<u>n</u>a) double the merits are obtained and
when the sun is in his Northern course, ten times more religious merits
are obtained. The Ganges bathing in the time of Châturmâsya, full Moon
day, Ak<u>s</u>ayâ Navamî or Ak<u>s</u>ayâ trittîyâ yields merits that
cannot be measured. And if on the above Parva (particular periods of the
year on which certain ceremonies are commanded) days both bathing, and
making

 

<span id="page_848">p. 848</span>

 

over gifts are done, there is no limit to the religious merits acquired;
hundred times more than ordinary bath, religious merits are obtained.
Great religious merits accrue from the Ganges bath on Manvantarâ tithi,
Yugâdyâ, S'uklâ seventh day of the month of Mâgha, Bhîsmâstamî day,
As'okâstamî day, and S’rî Râma Navamî day. Again double the merits than
those of the above arise from bathing in the Ganges during the Nandâ
ceremony. The Gauges bath in the Das'aharâ tenth tithi gives merits
equivalent to Yugâdyâ Snânam (bath). And if the bathing be done on
Mahânandâ or in Mahâvâru<u>n</u>î day, four times more religious merits
accrue. Ten million times more religious merits accrue from the Ganges
bathing on Mahâ Mahâ Vâru<u>n</u>î day than ordinary bath. The Ganges
bath in the Solar eclipse yields ten times more religious merits than in
the Lunar eclipse. Again the Snânam in Ardhodaya Yoga yields hundred
times more religious merits than that of the (solar) eclipse. Thus
saying to Gangâ before Bhagîratha, the Lord of the Devas remained
silent. The Devî Gangâ with her head bowed down with devotion, said :--

 

39-42. Gangâ said :-- If I am after all, to go to Bhârata as Thou
commandest and under the curse given previously by Bhâratî, then tell me
how I would be freed of the sins that the sinners will cast on me. How
long will I have to remain there? When, O Lord! Shall I be able to
return to the Highest place of Vi<u>sn</u>u? O Thou, the Inner Self of
all! O All Knowing! O Lord! Whatever else I desire, Thou knowest them
all. So be pleased to instruct me on all these points.

 

43-69. Bhagavân S’rî Hari said :-- O Sures'varî! I know all that you
desire; when you will assume the liquid form, the Salt Ocean will be
your husband. He is My part and you are of the nature of Lak<u>s</u>mî;
so the union of the lover with the love stricken in the world will turn
out a happy and qualified one. Of all the rivers Sarasvatî and others in
Bhârata, that go to mix with the ocean, you will be the best and highly
fortunate of them all. From today you will have to remain in Bhârata for
a period of five thousand years, under the curse of Bhâratî. You will be
able to enjoy daily and always the pleasures with the Ocean. O Devî! As
you are a clever lady, so He is also apt and expert. The inhabitants of
Bhârata will praise Thee and worship Thee with great devotion by the
stotra which Bhagîratha has composed. He will derive the fruit of one
horse-sacrifice who will meditate on Thee as per Kâ<u>n</u>vas'âkhâ and
worship, praise and bow down to Thee daily. Even if one utter “Gangâ,”
“Gangâ,” though one is one hundred Yojanas away from the Ganges, one
will be freed of all sins and go to Vis<u>nu</u>-loka. Whatever sins
will be cast in Thee by thousand sinners bathing in Thee will be
destroyed by the touch of the devotees of Prakriti Devî. Even if

 

<span id="page_849">p. 849</span>

 

thousands and thousands of sinners touch the dead bodies and bath in
Thee, all those will be destroyed when the Devî Bhaktas,the worshippers
of Bhuvanes'varî and Mâyâ Vîja, will come and touch Thee. O Auspicious
One! Thou wilt wash away the sins of the sinners, by Thy stay in Bhârata
with other best rivers Sarasvatî and others. That will be at once a
sacred place of pilgrimage where Thy glories will be chanted. By the
touch of the dust of Thine, the sinner will be at once purified and he
will dwell in the Devî-loka (Mani Dvîpa) for as many years as will be
the dust there. All Hail to the Devî Bhuvanes'varî! He who will leave
his body on Thy lap with full consciousness and remembering My name,
will certainly go to My abode and will remain, as My chief attendant for
an infinite period. He will see countless Prâkritik Layas (dissolutions
of the Universe). Unless a man has collected hordes of religious merits,
be cannot die in the Ganges; and if he dies on the Ganges he goes to
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha as long as the Sun rises in this world. I get many
bodies for him where he can enjoy the fruits of his Karma and I then
give him My Svârûpya (Form resembling Mine) and make him My attendant.
If any ignorant man, void of any Jñânam, quits his body by touching
merely Thy water, I give him Sâlokya (place in My region) and make him
My attendant. Even if one quits one's body in a far off place, uttering
Thy Name, I give him place in My region for one life time of Brahmâ. And
if he remembers Thee with devotion, and quits his mortal coil at another
place, I give him Sârûpya (Form resembling Mine) for a period of endless
Prâkritik Layas. He instantly gets on an aerial car made of jewels and
goes with My attendants to the region of Goloka and gets form like Me.
Those that worship daily My Mantra, that pass their day eating the
remnant of the food offered to Me, they need not have any distinction
whether they die in Tîrath or not. They themselves can easily purify the
three worlds. Getting on the excellent and best aerial car built of
jewels, they go to the region of Goloka. O Chaste One! Even if the
friends of My devotees, be born in animal births, they also will be
purified by the devotion shown towards Me and getting on a jewelled
aerial car will be able to go to Goloka, so diffcult of access. Wherever
the Bhaktas may be, if they simply remember Me with devotion, they will
become liberated while living by the power of My Bhakti. Thus saying to
Gangâ, Bhagavân S’rî Hari addressed Bhagîratha :-- O Child! Now worship
Gangâ Devî with devotion and chant hymns to Her. The pure Bhagîrata
meditated with devotion as per Kauthuma S'âkhâ and worshipped the Devî
and praised Her repeatedly. Then Gangâ and Bhagîratha bowed down to S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a and He disappeared at once from their sight.

 

70\. The Devar<u>s</u>i Nârada said :-- “O Thou the foremost of the
Knowers of the Vedas! How, by what Kuthuma S’âkhâ, the noble King Bhagi-

 

<span id="page_850">p. 850</span>

 

ratha meditated on the Devî Gangâ; what stotra did he recite and what
was the method with which he worshipped the Ganges.

 

71-75. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! One should first take one's
bath, and putting on a clean washed clothing should perform one's daily
duties. Then one should control oneself and with devotion worship the
six Devatâs Ga<u>n</u>es’a, Sun, Fire, Vi<u>sn</u>u, S’iva and S'ivânî.
Thus one becomes entitled to worship. First worship is to be given to
Ga<u>n</u>es'a for the destruction of obstacles; the Sun is to be next
worshipped for health; Fire, for purification; Vi<u>sn</u>u is then
worshipped for getting wealth and power; S’iva is worshipped for
knowledge and S'ivânî is worshipped for Mukti. When these Devatâs are
worshipped, one is entitled to worship the Deity. Otherwise contrary
become the effects. Now I am saying what Dhyâ<u>n</u>am (meditation) did
Bhagîratha practise towards the Devî Gangâ .

 

Here ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Ninth Book on the origin of the
Ganges in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000
verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
