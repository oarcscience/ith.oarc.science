**THE NINTH BOOK**

 

**Chapter XXXVIII**

 

**On the glories of the Devî and on the nature of Bhakti**

 

<span id="page_952">p. 952</span>

 

1-6. Sâvitrî said :-- “O Lord! Give me the devotion to the Devî to that
Âdyâ S’akti Bhagavatî Mahâ Mâye, Parames’varî Mâyî that is the Essence
of all essences, the Door of final liberation to the human beings, and
the Cause of delivering them from hells, that is the Root of all the
Dharmas that lead to Mukti, that destroys all the inauspiciousness, that
takes away the fear of all the Karmas, and that takes away always all
the sins committed before. O Thou, the Foremost amongst the knowers of
the Vedas! How many kinds of Muktis are there in this world? What is the
True Bhakti? What are its characteristics? What is to be done by which
the enjoyment of the karmas done can be desisted and nullified? O
Bhagavân! The woman kind has been created by the Creator as devoid of
any Tattvajñâna or true knowledge; now tell me something about this True
Knowledge. All the charities, sacrifices, bathing in the sacred places
of pilgrimages, observing vows and austerities cannot be compared with
one sixteenth of imparting knowledge to those who are ignorant (of true
knowledge). Mother is hundred times superior to father; this is certain;
but the Spiritual Teacher, the Giver of True Knowledge, is hundred times
more to be reverenced and worshipped than the mother. O Lord!”

 

7-79. Dharmarâja said :-- O Child! What boons you desired of Me before,
I granted them all to you. Now I grant this boon to you that, “Let the
devotion towards the S’akti now arise in your mind.” O Auspicious One!
You want to hear the reciting of the Glories of S’rî Devî; by this, both
he who puts forward the question and he who hears the answer, all their
families are delivered. When the S’esa Nâga Ananta Deva with His
thousand mouths is unable to recite the glories of the Devî, when
Mahâdeva cannot describe with His five mouths, when the Creator Brahmâ
is incapable to recite Her glories with His four mouths, when
Vi<u>sn</u>u, the Omniscient, falls back, when Kârtîkeya with His six
mouths cannot sufficiently describe, when Ganes’a, the Guru of the Gurus
of the great yogis is incapable, when the Pundits, the knowers of the
four Vedas, the Essence of all the S’âstras, cannot know even a bit of
Her, when Sarasvatî becomes inert in going to describe Her glories; when
Sanatkumara, Dharma, Sanâtana, Sananda, Sanaka, Kapila, Sûrya and other
sons of the Creator have fallen back, when the other Siddhas, Yogîndras,
Munîndras are quite incapable to glorify the deeds of Prakriti Devî,
then how can I recite fully the Glories of Her? Whose lotus-feet Brahmâ,

 

<span id="page_953">p. 953</span>

 

Vi<u>sn</u>u, S’iva and others meditate; and lo! when it becomes
difficult for Her devotees even to think of Her, then what wonder is
there that She will be so very rare to others! Brahmâ, skilled in the
knowledge of the Vedas knows more of Her than what other ordinary
persons know so little of Her auspicious Glories. More than Brahmâ,
Ganes’a, the Guru of the Jñânins, knows; again S’ambhu, the Omniscient,
knows the best of all. For, in ancient times, the knowledge of the
Prakriti Devî was given to Him by Kri<u>sn</u>a, the Highest Spirit in a
solitary place in the Râsa Ma<u>nd</u>alam in the region of Goloka.
Mahâdeva, again, gave it to Dharma in the S’ivaloka; Dharma again gave
the Prakriti Mantra to My father. My father became successful (Siddha)
in the worship of Prakriti Devî when he practised austerities. Of old,
the Devas wanted to offer to me the Government of the Yama Loka; but as
I was very much dispassionate towards the world, I became unwilling and
became ready to perform austerities. Then my Father told the Glories of
Prakriti Devî. Now I describe to you what I heard from my Father and
what is stated in the Vedas, though very difficult to comprehend. Listen
carefully. O Fair Faced One! As the eternal space does not know its own
extent, so Prakriti Devî Herself knows not Her own Glories; then what
can be said of any other person on this! She is the Self of all, endowed
with all powers and lordship, the Cause of all causes, the Lord of all,
the Origin of all and the Preserver of all; She is Eternal, always with
Her Cosmic Body, full of everlasting bliss, without any special form,
unrestrained, having no fear, without any disease and decay, unattached,
the Witness of all, the Refuge of all, and Higher than the Highest; She
is with Mâyâ and She is Mûla Prakriti; the objects created by Her being
known as the Prakriti creation; Who remains as Prakriti and
Puru<u>s</u>a inseparable from each other as Ag<u>n</u>i and Her burning
force; the Mahâ Mâyâ, of the nature of everlasting existence,
intelligence and bliss. Though formless, She assumes forms for the
gratification of the desires of Her Bhaktas. She created first the
beautiful form of Gopâla Sundarî, i.e., the form of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a
very lovely and beautiful, captivating the mind. His body is blue like
the fresh rain cloud; He is young and dressed like that of a cow herd.
Millions of Kandarpas (the Love deity) are, as it were, playing in his
body. His eyes vie with the midday lotus of the autumn. The beauty of
His face throws under shade the millions and millions of the Full Moon.
His body is decorated with invaluable ornaments decked with jewels.
Sweet smile reigns ever in His lips; it is adorned moreover with His
yellow coloured invaluable robe. He is Parama Brahmâ. His whole body is
burning with the Brahmâ Teja, the Fire of Brahmâ.

 

<span id="page_954">p. 954</span>

 

His Body is Fiery. He is lovely, sweet to look at, of a peaceful temper,
the Lord of Râdhâ and He is Infinite. (Note :-- The Universe; as we see,
is unreal like what we see in the kaleidoscope; various apparent
pictures of an endless variety of beautiful colours and forms.) He is
sitting on a jewel throne in the Râsa Ma<u>nd</u>alam, and is
incessantly looked upon by the smiling lovely Gopîs at one and the same
time. He is two-armed. A garland made of wild flowers is hanging from
His neck. He is playing on His flute. His breast is resplendent with
Kaustubha gem that He always wears. His body is anointed with Kunkuma
(saffron), aguru (the fragrant and cooling paste of the Aguru wood),
musk, and sandal-paste. The garland of beautiful Champaka and Mâlatî
flowers is hanging from His neck. On His head, the beautiful crest is
being seen, a little obliquely situated in the form of the beautiful
Moon. Thus the Bhaktas, filled with Bhaktis, meditate on Him. O Child!
It is through His fear that the Creator is doing His work of creation of
this Universe; and is recording the Prârabdha fruits of their Karmas. It
is through His fear that Vi<u>sn</u>u is awarding the fruits of Tapas
and preserving the Universe. By His command the Kâlagni Rudra Deva is
destroying all. By Whose favour S’iva has become Mrityumjaya, the
Conqueror of Death and the Foremost of the Jñânins; knowing whom S’iva
has become Himself endowed with knowledge and the Lord of the knowers of
knowledge, full of the Highest Bliss, devotion and dispassion. Through
Whose fear the wind becomes the foremost of runners and carries things,
the Sun gives heat, Indra gives rain, Yama destroys, Ag<u>n</u>i burns,
and Water cools all the things. By Whose command the Regents of the
(ten) quarters of the sky are watching and preserving nice orders;
through Whose fear the planets are describing their several orbits.
Through Whose fear, trees flower and yield fruits; By Whose command the
Kâla destroys all. By Whose command all the beings whether on land or in
water are quitting their lives in time; until the proper time comes no
man does not die even if he be pierced whether in battle or in danger.
By Whose command the wind supports the water; the water supports the
tortoise; the tortoise supports the Ananta and the Ananta supports the
earth; the earth supports the oceans, mountain and all the jewels. The
earth is of the nature of forgiveness, i.e., endures all. For this
reason all things, moving and non-moving, rest on Her and again melt
away in Her. Seventy-one Divine Yugas constitute one Indra’s life
period. Twenty-eight Indra’s life periods constitute Brahmâ’s one day
and one night. Thus thirty days constitute Brahmâ’s one month; so two
months constitute one Ritu (season); six Ritus make one year. Thus one
hundred years constitute Brahmâ’s

life. When Brahmâ dies, S’rî Hari’s eye closes. That is the Prâkritik
Pralaya. At this time, everything, moving and non-moving, from the Deva
loka to Bhûr loka (earth) dies. The Creator Brahmâ gets dissolved in the
navel of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a. The four-armed Vi<u>sn</u>u, of
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha, sleeps on K<u>s</u>îra Samudra, the ocean of milk,
i.e., He dissolves on the left side of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, the Highest
Spirit. All the other S’aktis (forces) dissolve in Mûla Prakriti, the
Mâyâ of Vi<u>sn</u>u. The Mûla Prakriti Durgâ, the Presiding Deity of
Buddhi (reason) dissolves in the Buddhi of Kri<u>sn</u>a. Skanda, the
part of Nârâya<u>n</u>a, dissolves in His breast. Gane’sa, the foremost
of the Devas, born in part of Kri<u>sn</u>a, dissolves in the arm of
S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a. And those who are born in parts of Padmâ, dissolve
in Her body and Padmâ dissolves in the body of Râdhâ. All the
cow-herdesses and all the bodies of the Devas dissolve in Râdhâ’s body.
But Râdhâ, the Presiding Deity of the Prâ<u>n</u>a of S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a, dissolves in the Prâ<u>n</u>a of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a.
Sâvitrî, the four Vedas and all the S’âstras dissolve in Sarasvatî; and
Sarasvatî gets dissolved in the tongue of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, the
Highest Self. The Gopâs in the region of Goloka dissolve in the pores of
His skin; the Prâ<u>n</u>a Vâyu of all dissolve in His Prâ<u>n</u>a
Vâyu; the fire dissolves in the fire in His belly; water dissolves in
the tip of His tongue, and the Vai<u>sn</u>avas, (devotees of
Vi<u>sn</u>u), drinking the nectar of Bhakti, the Essence of all
essences, dissolve in His lotus-feet. All smaller Virâts dissolve in the
Great Virât and the Great Virât dissolves in the Body of S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a. O Child! He is Kri<u>sn</u>a, on the pores of Whose skin
are situated endless Universes; at the closing of Whose eyes, the
Prâkritic Pralaya comes and on the opening of Whose eyes, the creation
takes place. The closing and opening of the eyes takes the same time.
Brahmâ’s creation lasts one hundred years and the Pralaya lasts one
hundred years. O One of good vows! There is no counting how many Brahmâs
or how many creations and dissolutions have taken place. As one cannot
count the number of dusts, so one cannot count the creations and
dissolutions. This is the Great Unspeakable Wonder! Again on Whose
closing of the eyes the Pralaya takes place and on whose opening of the
eyes the creation takes place, out of the will of God, That
Kri<u>sn</u>a dissolves at the time of Pralaya in Prakriti. This Highest
S’akti, the Mûla Prakriti is the Only One without a second; it is the
only one Nirgu<u>n</u>a and the Highest Puru<u>s</u>a. It is considered
as “Sat” existing, by the Seers of the Vedas. Such a thing as Mûla
Prakriti is the unchanged state (Mukti). During the Pralaya, this only
One Mûla Prakriti appears as Jñâna S’akti or the Knowledge Force. Who
can in this universe recite Her glories? Mukti is of four kinds.

 

<span id="page_956">p. 956</span>

 

 (1) Sâlokya, (2) Sârûpya, (3) Sâmîpya and (4) Nirvâ<u>n</u>a. So it is
stated in the Vedas. Out of them Bhakti towards the Deva is the highest;
so much so that the Deva Bhakti is superior to Mukti. Mukti gives
Sâlokya, Sârûpya, Sâmîpya, and Nirvâ<u>n</u>a. But the Bhaktas do not
want anything. They want service of the Lord. They do not want anything
else. The state of becoming S’iva, of becoming an Amara or an immortal,
becoming a Brahmâ, the birth, death, disease, old age, fear, sorrow, or
wealth, or assuming a divine form, or Nirvâ<u>n</u>a or Moksa all are
looked on alike by the Bhaktas with disregard and contempt. Because
Mukti is without any service while Bhakti increases this service. Thus I
have told you the difference between Bhakti and Mukti. Now hear about
the cutting off of the fruits of the past Karmas. O Chaste one! This
service of the Highest Lord severs the ties of Karmas (past acts). This
service is really the True Knowledge. So, O Child! I have now told you
the Real Truth, leading to auspicious results. Now you can go freely as
you desire. Thus saying to Sâvitrî, Yama, the son of Sûrya, gave life
back to her husband and blessing her, became ready to go to His own
abode. Seeing Dharmarâja ready to go away, Sâvitrî became sorry to have
the bereavement of a good company, bowed down at His feet and began to
cry. Yama, the Ocean of Mercy, hearing the crying of Sâvitrî began to
weep and told the following words :--

 

80-96. Dharma said :-- O Child! You enjoy in this holy Bhârata happiness
for one lakh years and you will in the end go to the Devîloka or
Ma<u>n</u>i Dvîpa. Now go back to your house and observe for fourteen
years the vow called Sâvitrî-vrata for the mukti of women. This Vrata is
to he observed on the fourteenth day of the white fortnight in the month
of Jyaistha. Then observe the Mahâ-Lak<u>s</u>mî Vrata. Its proper time
is the eighth day of the bright fortnight of the month of Bhâdra. For
sixteen years consecutively without any break this vow is to be
observed. The woman who practises with devotion this vow, goes to the
abode of Mûla Prakriti. You would worship on every Tuesday in every
month the Devî Mangala Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ, the giver of all good; on the
eighth day in the bright fortnight you should worship Devî Sâ<u>st</u>hî
(i.e., Devasenâ); you should worship Manasâ Devî, the giver of all
siddhis, on the Samkranti day (when the Sun enters another sign) in
every year; you should worship Râdhâ, the Central Figure of Râsa, more
than the Prâ<u>n</u>a of Kri<u>sn</u>a on every Full Moon night in the
month of Kârtik and you should observe fasting on the eighth day in the
bright fortnight and worship the Vi<u>sn</u>u Mâyâ Bhagavatî Devî, the
Destructrix of all difficulties and dangers.

 

<span id="page_957">p. 957</span>

 

 (Note :-- The Râsa is the playing out of the Vedantic saying of Brahmâ
as “Raso vai Sah.” He is of the nature of Râsa, the most sweet and
lovely Divine Principle which unites the Rasika and the Rasikâ.) The
chaste woman having husband and sons who worships the World Mother Mûla
Prakriti, whether in Yantra, or in Mantra or in image, enjoys all
pleasures in this world; and, in the end, goes to the Devîloka or
Ma<u>n</u>i Dvîpa. O Child! The worshipper Sâdhaka (one who is in one’s
way to success) must worship all the manifestations of the Devî, day and
night. At all times one must worship the omnipresent Durgâ, the Highest
Îsvarî. There is no other way to attain blessedness than this. Thus
saying, Dharmarâja went to His own abode. Sâvitrî, too, with her husband
Satyavân went to her home. Both Sâvitrî and Satyavân, when they reached
home, narrated all their stories to their friends and acquaintances. In
time, by the blessing of Yama, Sâvitrî’s father got sons and
father-in-law recovered his eye-sight and kingdom and Sâvitrî Herself
got sons. For one lakh years, Sâvitrî enjoyed pleasures in this holy
land of Bhârata, and ultimately went with her husband to the Devîloka.
Sâvitrî is the Presiding Deity of the Sûryama<u>nd</u>alam, the solar
orb. The Sun is the central Para Brahmâ. The Gâyatrî Mantra, the
Presiding Devî, proves the existence of the highest Brahmâ in the centre
of the Sun. Therefore She is called Sâvitrî. Or Her name is Sâvitrî
because all the Vedas have come out of Her. Thus I have narrated the
excellent anecdote of Sâvitrî, and the fruitions of the Karmas of the
several Jîvas. Now what more do you want to hear? Say.

 

Here ends the Thirty-eighth Chapter in the Ninth Book on the glories of
the Devî and on the nature of Bhakti in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad
Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
