<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

 

1\. Vyâsa said :-- O king! Those Kumârîs, who are defective in limbs,
who are lepers, who are filled with sores and ulcers over their bodies,
whose bodies emit offensive smell or whose bodies are polluted, or those
who are

 

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

 

of a bad family are never to be accepted for worship in the Navarâtra
ceremony festival.

 

2-3. Those who are born blind, who are squint-eyed, who are blind of one
eye, of disgraceful appearance, whose bodies are overgrown with hairs,
or who are diseased or who are in their menstruation or in any other
signs, indicating thus their passionate youthful tendencies, or those
who are very lean and thin, or born of widows, or of women unmarried are
always to be avoided in this Pûjâ.

 

4\. O king! It is only the healthy, graceful, beautiful, without any
ulcers, and who are not bastards, those virgins are to be selected for
the Kumârî Pûjâ.

 

5\. In all the cases, the Kumârîs, born of the Brâhmi<u>n</u> families,
can be taken; when victory is desired, the Kumârîs of the
K<u>s</u>hattriya families are preferred; when profit is wanted, the
Vais’ya Kumârîs and, when general welfare is wanted, the S’ûdra Kumârîs
are to be taken.

 

6-7. O king! In the Navarâtri Pûjâ, the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s should select
for worship the Brâhmi<u>n</u> Kumârîs; K<u>s</u>hattriyas,
Brâhmi<u>n</u> or K<u>s</u>hattriya; the Vais’ya worshippers can select
for worship Brâhmi<u>n</u>, K<u>s</u>hattriya, or Vais’ya Kumârîs. And
the S’ûdra worshippers can select, for worship, any of the four classes.
But artists and artisans should select for worship the Kumârîs from
their own families and tribes respectively.

 

8\. If persons become unable to worship on all the days, then it is
advised that they should perform the special worship on the eighth day
(Astamî tithi).

 

9-10. In ancient times, on the eighth day, Bhadra Kâli Goddess, the
destroyer of the sacrifice, started by Dak<u>s</u>a, appeared on that
day in hideous forms, surrounded by hundreds and lakhs of Yoginîs (one
of a class of sixty goddesses or female attendants on Kâli). Therefore
one should worship in particular on the eighth day with scents,
garlands, and pastes and various offerings.

 

11\. On this day, Pâyasa (a food prepared of rice, milk and sugar), and
fresh fish are to be specially offered to the Deity. The Homa
ceremonies, feasting of the Brâhma<u>n</u>s, and the worship of the
Mother Goddess are done with various offerings, the fruits and flowers,
and in good quantities.

 

12\. O king! Those who are unable to observe the fasting in this
Navarâtra Pûjâ, will reap the same fruits, if they observe fasting for
the three days only the Saptamî, the A<u>st</u>amî, and the Navamî
tithis.

 

13\. On the seventh, eighth, and ninth days, in these three tithis
(lunar days) if one worships with devotion, one will acquire all the
merits.

 

14\. When the Devî’s worship, Homa, Kumârî worship and the feasting of
the Brâhma<u>n</u>as, all these are done, know that the Navarâtri Pûjâ
is completed.

 

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

 

15\. O Janamejaya! No worship or vow or charitable gifts extant in this
world, can be compared, as regards their meritorious effects, with this
Navarâtra Pûjâ.

 

16\. On observing this Navarâtram Vrata, one gets riches, crops, sons
and grandsons, prosperity and happiness, longevity, health and heaven
and even the final beatitude.

 

17\. Those who are desirous of learning, riches, or sons will get them
all if they perform this most auspicious Navarâtra ceremony, able to
confer fortunes on the devotees.

 

18\. On the performance of this sacrifice, those who want learning get
all the learning; and he, who is deprived of his kingdom will get back
all his kingdoms.

 

19\. Those who did not, in their previous births, perform this
meritorious vow, they become diseased, poor and devoid of sons in their
present births.

 

20\. Those women that are barren, or widows or devoid of sons, infer
that they never, in their previous births, performed this sacrifice.

 

21\. Those who have not performed the Navarâtra ceremony, how can they
acquire riches in this world and acquire happiness and peace in the
next?

 

22\. He who has worshipped the Goddess Bhagavatî Bhavânî Devî with young
leaves of the Bel tree, besmeared with red sandal paste, it is he that
will undoubtedly become the king in this world.

 

23\. That man who has failed to worship the Goddess of the whole
universe, Who fructifies all the pursuits of human life, Who destroys
all the troubles, pains and miseries, Who is all suspicious Bhagavatî
Bhavânî, that fellow is sure to pass his days in this world, wretched,
impoverished, and surrounded by his enemies on all sides.

 

24\. When Hari, Hara, Brahmâ, Indra, Fire, Varu<u>n</u>a, Kuvera, and
the Sun when all these possessing all the wealth and powers and filled
with the highest felicities, when they meditate constantly the Goddess
of the universe, Who is All Existence Intelligence, and Bliss, then what
to speak of the human beings! How is it that persons do not worship that
Chandikâ Devî, the One that leads all human pursuits to success!

 

25-26. Why should not the people worship the Goddess Bhavânî, the
bestower of all happiness, whose other names are Svahâ and Svadhâ, the
mantrams under whose intrinsic energies the Devas and the Pitris always
get satisfied, and which are recited by all the Munis when they chant in
every sacrifice the Vedic mantrams? Under Whose Will power Brahmâ the
Creator, creates all this Universe? Under Whose energy, the

 

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

 

Vi<u>sn</u>u Janâradan, the Deva of the Devas, incarnates in this earth
in various forms and preserves this world, and under Whose power,
S’ankara destroys this whole Universe?

 

27\. No body, in this whole universe, can have his existence without
having recourse to that Prakriti Devî, the S’akti incarnate; be he a
Devî, a human being or a bird, or a serpent, Gandharva, Râkhsasa,
Pis’âcha, a mountain or a tree, he cannot move even of his own accord,
without the help of this Force.

 

28\. Therefore, why should not anybody worship that Chandikâ Devî, the
Awarder of all desires and wealth? And how is it, that a man desiring
one of the 4 objects of human pursuits, Dharma, wealth, desires, and the
final beatitude, observes not the vow regarding that Deity.

 

29\. So much so, that even a man who has committed a heinous offence,
five such are enumerated, viz. (1) killing a Brâhma<u>n</u>, (2)
drinking liquor, (3) stealing gold, (4) adultery with the wife of a
spiritual guide (5) associating with any such person, if he performs the
Navarâtra vow, he will be absolved entirely from all such sins; there is
no doubt in this.

 

30\. O king! Once on a time there lived in the country of Kosala, a
trader, poor and miserable, having under him many relations and
dependants in his family, whose provisions he had to provide.

 

31\. He had many sons and daughters; when they were very hungry and
distressed, then they used to get a little food and that in the evening,
only once in twenty-four hours.

 

32\. That trader, too, worked under another, the whole day; and when it
was evening, he used also to take his meals. Thus, being very much
anxious and distressed, he maintained somehow or other his family
members (that are to be maintained).

 

33-34. This trader was of a quiet temper, of a good conduct, truthful,
always ready to act religiously, devoid of anger, steady and contented,
void of vanity and jealousy; daily he used to worship the Devas, Pitris,
and the guests and used to take his meals after all his family members
had taken their meals.

 

35-36. Thus many days passed away when that good trader, named Sus’îla,
being very much perplexed with poverty and hunger, asked a quiet
tempered Brâhmi<u>n</u> “O Bhûdeva! (deva incarnate on the earth) kindly
tell me positively how this state of poverty can be got rid off!

 

37\. O holy minded! Kindly advise me such as preserves my honour; I do
not want wealth, nor do I like to be a rich man; O Brâhmi<u>n</u>! I
want just enough to meet with the expenses, incurred in maintaining my
family; please advise so that I may be able to earn this much only.

 

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

 

38\. I have many sons; I have not got any food, sufficient enough to
give them even a handful of rice.

 

39\. Alas! My youngest son was crying today for food; I have driven him
out of the house by chastising him. O Brâhmi<u>n</u>! What am I do? I
have got no wealth; my heart is burning with grief and sorrow; my baby
has gone out of the house, weeping and hungry.

 

40\. My daughter has come to a marriageable age; I have no money. Her
age has exceeded ten years; the marriageable age limit has been
exceeded. Alas! What am I to do?

 

41-42. O Brâhmi<u>n</u>! I am expressing my sorrow for all that. You are
merciful, and all-knowing; tell me any means, be it asceticism, gifts,
vow, or the reciting of any mantrams by which I can maintain my family;
I want wealth just sufficient for that purpose and nothing more.

 

43\. O high minded one! Kindly devise and tell me some means by which my
family members become happy in this world.”

 

44-46. Vyâsa said :-- The Brâhmi<u>n</u> that used to practice vows when
thus asked by the trader told him gladly “O trader! Do now the Navarâtri
vow, the most auspicious, and worship the Bhagavatî, perform Homa, and
feast the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s. Have the Vedas and Purâ<u>n</u>as recited and
recite then slowly the S’akti mantram and try, as much as you can, to do
other concomitant ceremonies; and your desires will thus be undoubtedly
fulfilled.

 

47\. There is no other vow superior to this in this world; this vow is
very holy and will bring unto you happiness.

 

48\. This vow leads to wisdom and liberation; destroys enemies and
increases posterity and prosperity.

 

49\. In former days, S’rî Râma Chandra suffered very much owing to his
being deprived of his kingdom; and, then on account of his wife being
stolen away. Subsequently he performed this Navarâtra vow in Kiskindhyâ,
his heart being heavily laden with grief.

 

50\. Though troubled very much, on account of the bereavement of Sîtâ,
still Râma Chandra observed the Vow of Navarâtra and worshipped the
Goddess according to the prescribed rules and rites.

 

51-52. As a fruit of this worship he was able to bridge the great ocean
and kill the giant Kumbha Kar<u>n</u>a, Meghanâda, the Râva<u>n</u>a’s
son, and Râva<u>n</u>a, the king of Lanka; and subsequently he was able
to recover his Sîtâ. He installed Vibhî<u>s</u>a<u>n</u>a on the throne
of Lanka (Ceylon) and at last returned to Ayodhyâ and reigned there
without any enemies.

 

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

 

53\. O best of the Vais’yas! Râma Chandra, of incomparable prowess, was
able to obtain happiness in this world on account of the influence of
this Navarâtra ceremony.

 

54-55. Vyâsa said :-- O king! That Vais’ya, hearing thus the
Brâhmi<u>n</u>’s words, made him his Guru, was initiated by him in the
seed mantra of Mâyâ and ceaselessly, without any laziness, recited
slowly the mantram for nine nights and worshipped the Devî, with great
caution and with various offerings. Thus for nine consecutive years he
devoted himself to the Japam (reciting slowly) of the seed mantra of
Mâyâ till, at last, when the ninth year was completed, the Great Goddess
appeared distinctly before his eyes on the night of the great Astamî
tithi (the eighth day of the bright half) and gave him various boons and
delivered the Vais’ya from poverty and bestowed on him wealth and his
other desired things.

 

Here ends the 27th Chapter on the virgins fit to be worshipped and the
Glory of the Devî in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S’rîmad Devî Bhâgavatam by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa in the Third Adhyâya.
