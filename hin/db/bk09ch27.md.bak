1-2. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! After having chanted the above
hymn to the Goddess Sâvitrî and worshipped Her in accordance with due
rites and ceremonies, the king As’vapati saw the Devî, effulgent like
the lustre of thousand suns. She then smilingly told the king, as a
mother to her son, whilst all the quarters were illumined with the
lustre of Her body :--

 

3-14. Sâvitrî said :-- “O King! I know your desire. Certainly I will
give what you and your wife long for. Your chaste wife is anxious for a
daughter, while you want a son. So, one after another,

the desires of both of you will be fulfilled.” Thus saying, the Devî
went to the Brahma Loka. The King also returned to his house. First a
daughter was born to him. As the daughter was born, as if a second
Lak<u>s</u>mî was born after worshipping Sâvitrî, the King kept her name
as Sâvitrî. As time rolled on, the daughter grew, day by day, like the
phases of bright fortnight moon, into youth and beauty. There was a son
of Dyumat Sena, named Satyavâna, always truthful, good natured and
endowed with various other qualifications. The daughter chose him for
her bridegroom. The King betrothed her with jewels and ornaments, to
Satyavâna, who gladly took her home. After one year expired, the
truthful vigorous Satyavâna gladly went out, by his father’s command, to
collect fruits and fuel. The chaste Sâvitrî, too, followed him.
Unfortunately Satyavâna fell down from a tree and died. Yama, the God of
Death, saw his soul as a Puru<u>s</u>a of the size of one’s thumb and
took it and went away. The chaste Sâvitrî began to follow Him. The high
souled Yama, the Foremost of the Sadhus, seeing Sâvitrî following Him,
addressed her sweetly :-- O Sâvitrî! Whither are you going in your this
mortal coil? If you like to follow after all, then quit your this body.

 

15-25. The mortal man, with his transient coil of these five elements,
is not able to go to My Abode. O Chaste One! The death time of your
husband arrived; therefore Satyavâna is going to My Abode to reap the
fruits of his Karma. Every living animal is born by his Karma. He dies
again through his life long Karma. It is his Karma alone that ordains
pleasure, pain, fear, sorrows, etc. By Karma, this embodied soul here
becomes Indra; by Karma he can become a Brahmâ’s son. What more than
this that Jîva, by his Karma, can be in Hari’s service and be free from
birth and death! By one’s own Karma all sorts of Siddhis and immortality
can be obtained; the four blessed regions as Vi<u>sn</u>u’s Sâlokya,
etc., also can be obtained by Karma. What more than this that by Karma,
a being becomes divine, human, or a King, or S’iva or Ganes’a! The state
of Munîndra, asceticism, K<u>s</u>attriyahood, Vais’yahood, Mlechhahood,
moving things, stones, Râk<u>s</u>asahood, Kinnaras, Kingship, becoming
trees, beasts, forest animals, inferior animals, worms, Daityas,
Dânavas, Asuras, all are fashioned and wrought by Karma and Karma alone.
O Nârada! Thus speaking, Yama remained silent.

 

Here ends the Twenty-seventh Chapter of the Ninth Book on the birth,
etc., of Sâvitrî in S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
