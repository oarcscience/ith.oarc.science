1-2. The King said :-- “O Best of Munis! Tell me the names of the holy
places of pilgrimage on the surface of this earth, the holy
K<u>s</u>etras and the holy rivers; what are the fruits acquired in
bathing there and in making charitable gifts as well; also what are the
rules of the journeys and acts there are to be conducted?”

 

3-34. Vyâsa said :-- Hear; I am describing to you various Tîrthas or
places of pilgrimage as well as those that are highly extolled as the
best places favourite to the Devî. Amongst the rivers the following are
reckoned as chief and holy :-- The Ganges, Jumnâ, Sarasvatî, Narmaddâ,
Gan<u>d</u>akî, Sindhu, Gomatî, Tamasâ, Cavery, Chandrahâgâ, Vetravatî,
Charmanvatî, Saraju, Tâpî, and Sâvramatî. Besides these, there are
hundreds of rivers on the surface of this earth; of them, those that
fall into the ocean, they are holier and those that have not reached the
ocean are less holy. Of those rivers that fall into the ocean, those
that always flow with great current, they are comparatively holier; but
in the two months S’râvan and Bhâdra (15th July - 15th September) all
the rivers are considered as if they are during their menstruation
periods; at this time also some rivers carry water of the rains just
sufficient to supply the villagers with water. O King! The following are
the famous places of pilgrimages calculated to bestow merits:--
Pu<u>s</u>kara, Kuruk<u>s</u>ettra, the holy Dharmâra<u>n</u>ya,
Pravâsa, Prayâga, Naimi<u>s</u>âra<u>n</u>ya, and Arbudâra<u>n</u>ya. O
King! Of the mountains, the following are considered as sacred :--
S’rîs’aila, Sumeru, Gandhamâdana; of the lakes, the following are very
holy and very famous :-- Mânasarovara, Vi<u>n</u>dusarovara and
Ak<u>s</u>oda; these are the chief lakes. To those Munis that meditate
on their Âtman, all the hermitages are sacred; still the hermitage of
Badri is always considered very sacred and the most celebrated; here
Nara and Nârâya<u>n</u>a, the two famous Munis, practised their
asceticism. The Vâmanâs’rama and S’atayûpâs’rama are also well known;
thus every hermitage is named after the Muni that practised asceticism
there. Thus innumerable holy places on the surface of the earth are
mentioned by the Munis as tending

to sanctify the hearts of the persons. At all these holy places, the
Devî is worshipped in special sites consecrated to Her. All the sins are
destroyed by their mere sight. The devotees of the Devî stay there, with
rules obeyed. I will mention afterwards some of these places in the
course of my narrations. O Best of kings! Going to these holy places,
charity, vow, sacrifices, asceticism and good acts all depend on one
another. The holy places of pilgrimages, asceticism, and observance of
vows depend on the purity of the articles (Dravya S’uddhi), on the
purity and one pointedness of actions (Kriyâ S’uddhi) and on the purity
of the mind and heart (Chitta S’uddhi). Some may attain, at times, the
Dravya S’uddhi and Kriyâ S’uddhi; but every one finds it very difficult
and, indeed, rarely get the Chitta S’uddhi. O King! This mind always
tries to seek shelter with various objects and is, therefore, always
restless. How, then, can the purity of mind be effected, with ease, when
it is occupied with all sorts of thoughts on various objects. Cupidity,
anger, greed, pride, and egoism, these bring about all sorts of
obstacles in the holy places of pilgrimages, in practising tapasyâ and
in observing vows. O King! Non-injury, truthfulness, non-stealing,
chastity and purity, controlling of senses, and observing one’s own
religion, all these bring about the fruits of the labour in visiting all
tîrthas. They bestow fruits that can be obtained by visiting all the
tîrthas. During one’s pilgrimage, one forsakes one’s Nitya Karma (daily
duties) and one has to come in contact with various persons. Hence one’s
journey becomes fruitless; rather it becomes a source of sin. The waters
of the sacred places can only wash the outside dirts and the impurities
of the physical bodies; they can never wash the impurities of their
inner minds. Were it the fact that the waters of the tîrthas could
purify their minds, why was it, then, that the Munis, residing on the
banks of the Ganges, and devoted to God, ever indulged themselves with
feelings of jealousy and enmity against each other. The humble Munis
like Vas’i<u>st</u>ha, and the Ri<u>s</u>is like Vis’vâmitra were always
entangled in love and hatred and they were ever impatient with anger.
Therefore it is evident that the internal purification, the purification
of heart, the bathing in the Gñân Gangâ flowing within, no doubt removes
more the dirt than the Ganges and other places of pilgrimages. O King!
No doubt this fact must be admitted on all hands that one’s impurity of
mind is washed away if by the strange combination of Fate, one comes in
intimate contact with a man possessed of the Divine Knowledge. O King!
The Vedas or S’âstras, vows or austerities, sacrifices or gifts none can
purify the heart. See! Vas’i<u>st</u>ha, the son of Brahmâ, though
versed in the Vedas and residing on the banks of the Ganges, was under
the control of love, hatred and other infirmities. Out of the enmity of
Vis’vâmitra and Vas’i<u>st</u>ha, arose the great battle

named Â<u>d</u>i Baka, astonishing even to the Gods. In this, the
ascetic Vis’vâmitra was cursed by Vas’i<u>st</u>ha, on account of some
curse in connection with the king Haris’chandra and had to take his
birth as a crane (Baka). The Ri<u>s</u>i Vas’i<u>st</u>ha was cursed
also by Vis’vâmitra and was born as a bird named S’arâri. Thus the two
powerful Ri<u>s</u>is were born as Â<u>d</u>i Baka and lived on the
banks of the Mânasarovara and they fought for full ten thousand years
(ajuta) terribly, out of anger, with their nails and beaks like two
maddened lions.

 

35-36. The King asked :-- “O Muni! Why were the two Mahar<u>si</u>s, the
two great ascetics and devoted to religion, involved in enmity with each
other? Both of them were intelligent; how was it that they knowing the
act of cursing to be a source of pain to men, cursed each other so
painfully?”

 

37-48. Vyâsa said :-- O King! In former times, there was born in the
solar dynasty a king Haris’chandra, the son of Tris’anku; he was the
best of the kings and reigned before Râmchandra. That King had no issue
and therefore promised to Varu<u>n</u>a, “O Lord of water and ocean! If
I get a son born to me, I will perform a sacrifice, called Naramedha,
where I will sacrifice my son for your propitiation.” Varu<u>n</u>a was
very pleased with the king when he made such a vow; and the exquisitely
beautiful queen held the foetus in the womb. Seeing his wife in the
family way, the king was very pleased and performed all the purificatory
ceremonies pertaining to the foetus in the womb. O King! When the queen
was delivered of a son endowed with all auspicious signs, the king
Haris’chandra was very glad and performed duly all the Jâta Karma
(natal) ceremonies and distributed as charity big sums of gold and many
cows giving good quantities of milk. When the festivities on the birth
of the child were celebrated in the palace on a grand scale,
Varu<u>n</u>a, the Lord of Waters, assuming the form of a
Brâhmi<u>n</u>, came up there. The King, too, honoured him duly with
seat and worshipped him regularly and asked him about his purpose, when
Varu<u>n</u>a spoke to him :-- “O King! I am Varu<u>n</u>a, the Lord of
Waters; you promised before that you would perform Naramedha sacrifice
where you would sacrifice your son; now do those things and keep your
words true.” The King became very much confused and was very much pained
at heart. He then checked his mental feelings of pain and spoke to the
Deva Varu<u>n</u>a, with folded hands :-- “O Lord! I will do the
sacrifice duly and fulfil the promise that I made before you and keep my
word. But, O Best of the Devas! My legal wife will be pure from her
Sûtikâ-S’auchak after one month, when I will perform the Naramedha
sacrifice.”

49-53. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of the king
Haris’chandra, Varu<u>n</u>a returned to his own abode; the King also
became glad, but he was somewhat anxious for fear of the destruction of
the child. When one month was complete, the sweet-speaking
Varu<u>n</u>a, the holder of the noose, assuming the form of a very pure
Brâhmi<u>n</u>, again came there to the palace of the king to examine
him. The King worshipped him duly and gave him the seat to sit and
spoke, with humility, the following reasonable words :-- “O Lord! My son
is not yet purified; how can he be tied to the sacrificial post for
being immolated? Therefore I will perform that sacrifice when the boy
becomes cleansed after a purificatory rite and becomes a
K<u>s</u>attriya. O Deva! If you know me as your humble servant, have
mercy on me; I will then consider myself as blessed. See! The children,
not passed through purificatory rites, are not entitled to any act;
therefore wait for some time longer.”

 

54-56. Varu<u>n</u>a said :-- “O King! You are deceiving me and putting
off the time longer and longer; I now see that you were issueless before
and now that you have got a son, you are bound up in an indissoluble tie
of affection for a son. Whatever it be, I now go back to my home at your
pitiful request; I will wait for some time longer and I will come again.
O child! Let you then be true to your words; if it be otherwise, I will
surely curse you and thus give vent to my angry feelings.”

 

57\. The King said :-- O Lord of the Waters! After the completion of the
Samâvartan ceremony (a pupil’s return home after finishing his holy
study), I will duly sacrifice my son at the great Naramedha sacrifice;
there is no doubt.

 

58-71. Vyâsa said :-- Varu<u>n</u>a was very pleased at the King’s words
and quickly went back saying “Let it be so.” The king also became
comforted. On the one hand, the king Haris’chandra’s son became widely
known by the name of Rohita; and as he got older, he became gradually
versed in all the sciences and became very clever and intelligent. That
boy then came to know by degrees the cause of the sacrifice in full
detail; and knowing that his death is quite certain, became very afraid
and quickly fled away from the King and went and stayed in caves of
mountains with a fearful heart. Then, when the proper time came,
Varu<u>n</u>a came up there to the royal palace, desirous to have the
sacrifice and spoke to the King thus :-- “O King! Now the prescribed
time has come; therefore perform the sacrifice that you have resolved to
celebrate.” The King was very much pained to hear this and spoke with a
very sad appearance :-- “O Best of the Devas! What can I do now?

 

<span id="page_526">p. 526</span>

 

My son has fled away out of the fear of his life; I do not know his
whereabouts.” Varu<u>n</u>a became very angry at these words and cursed
him thus :-- “O Liar! You are an hypocrite pundit; therefore you
deceived me frequently. Let therefore the disease dropsy come and attack
your body.” Varu<u>n</u>a, the Holder of the noose, cursing thus, went
back to his own abode. The King was attacked with that disease, remained
in his own residence, afflicted with cares and anxieties. Rohita, the
son of the king Haris’chandra, heard about the severe illness of his
father when he was very much tormented with that disease, as the curse
of Varu<u>n</u>a. One day a traveller told him :-- “O son of the King!
Your father is very ill with dropsy, due to the curse, and is very
sorry. Certainly your brain has turned wrong; vain is your coming in
this world; you have passed your life to no purpose, for you are staying
still in this mountain cave, abandoning your sorrowful father. Certainly
you are a bad disobedient son; what use is there in your keeping up this
body? What purpose will be served by your birth? When you have got this
body, you have abandoned that father and are staying in this solitary
cave. Know this as certain that to sacrifice one’s life is the duty of a
good and obedient son; therefore what more shall I say now than this
that your father the king Haris’chandra ailing from a severe illness is
very sorry for you and is always weeping.”

 

72-74. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing from the passerby these good
words, the prince Rohita wanted to go to his sorrowful father attacked
with disease when Indra assuming a Brâhmi<u>n</u> form came up to him
and began to speak to him when he was alone like one who was filled with
mercy. O Son of a King! You are a fool; are you not positively
acquainted with the fact that your father is in trouble; why then do you
intend in vain to go there?

 

Here ends the Twelfth Chapter on the cause of the war between Âdi and
Baka in the Sixth Book of the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am of S’rî Mad Devî
Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
