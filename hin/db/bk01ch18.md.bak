1-22. Sûta said :-- Mahâr<u>s</u>is! When the king Janaka heard of the
arrival of S’ûka Deva, the son of his Guru, he took his priest before
him and attended by his ministers came before him in pure spirit. Then
he duly worshipped S’ûka, offering him Pâdya, Arghya and an excellent
seat, and a cow, yielding milk and then enquired about his welfare.
S’ûka Deva accepted duly all the things offered by the king; and
informed him of his well-being and asked the king in return, of his
welfare and took his seat at ease on the Âsana. The king Janaka asked
the son of Vyâsa, full of peace :-- “O Mahâbhâga Muni Sattama! You are
devoid of any attachment and you have no desires. May I enquire why such
a person as your honoured self has come to me.” S’ûka Deva said :-- O
great king! my father told me thus :-- O child; take a wife; for the
house-holder's life is the best of all the âs'ramas but I thought that
will be the source of my bondage to this world and therefore did not
obey his word, though he was my highest Guru. He then again said to me
:-- If one takes a household life, it does not at once follow that he
will be held in bondage; yet I did not agree to that. Then the Muni,
thinking me still to be in some doubt, spoke this word of advice to me
:-- “O Son! Do not be sorry; go to Mi<u>t</u>hilâ and have your doubts
solved. There my disciple

the king Janaka, is governing his kingdom without any source of danger.
He is Jivanamukta (liberated while living) and is free from the ideas of
body, etc., so everybody knows. When that royal sage, Janaka, though
governing his kingdom, is not seen tied up by Mâyâ, then O Son! why are
you afraid of this Samsâra, when you are living this forest life.

 

Therefore, O Mahâbhâga! Trust me and marry; and in case you doubt very
much, then go and see the king Janaka; ask him and remove your doubts.
He will certainly solve your doubts. But, O Son! After hearing him, come
again quickly to me.” O king! When my father spoke thus, by his
permission I have come now to your capital. O king! I don't want any
thing, save Mok<u>s</u>a (liberation); therefore O Sinless one! Kindly
advise what am I to do, so that I attain Mok<u>s</u>a. O Lord of kings!
Practising asceticism, going to the holy places of pilgrimage, holding
vratas (vows), performing sacrifices, studying the Vedas, or earning
wisdom, whatever is the cause of Mok<u>s</u>a, kindly say that. Hearing
this, Janaka said :-- “O son of my Guru! I am telling what ought to be
done by the Brâhma<u>n</u>as, following the path of Mok<u>s</u>a;
listen. After having the holy thread, a Brâhmin should live in the house
of his Guru to study the Vedas, the Vedântas and pay the Dakshi<u>n</u>â
(the fee) to the Guru according to rules; he will then return home and
marry and enter into the householder's life; he should lead a life of
contentment, be free from desires, sinless and truthful and earn his
livelihood with a pure heart and according to the sanction of justice
and conscience. He is to perform the Agnihotra and other sacrifices; and
after getting sons and grandsons, he is to leave his wife under the care
of his son and then to take the life of a Vânaprastha (3rd stage of
life). That Brâhman, the knower of Dharma, must practise tapasyâ and
become master of his six passions (enemies); and when he gets disgusted
with the world and when the Vairâgyam (dispassion) will arise within
him, he would enter into the fourth Âs'rama. For, the man is first to
enter into the householder's life and when he will be quite
dispassionate towards the world, he will then have a right to take the
Âs’rama of Sannyâsa (Renunciation). A course contrary to this can never
entitle one to the Âs’rama of Sanyâsa.

 

This is the beneficial word of the Vedas and it must hold true; it
cannot be false; this is my firm belief. O S’ûka! In the Vedas are
mentioned forty-eight Samskâras (consecrations; purificatory rites); out
of which the learned Mahâtmas have reserved forty Samskâras for the
householders and the last eight Samskâras (S'ama, Dama, etc.,) for the
Sannyâsins. And this good usage is heard to come down from very ancient
times. A Brâhma<u>n</u>a ought to complete his previous Âs’ramas
successively and then enter into the succeeding Âs’rama.

 

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

 

23-30. S’ûka said :-- If the pure Vairâgyam (dispassion) arising out of
knowledge and wisdom (jñân and Vijñân) already arises (before taking to
the grihasth Âs'ram), is it still necessary to pass through house
holder’s life, Vânaprastha life, etc., or is one entitled then to take
up at once the Sannyâsa Âs'rama, quit everything and reside in the
forest? Janaka said :-- O! One giving honour to the S’âstras and Gurus!
Though the powerful passions seem to be under control in the period of
unripened Yoga (the imperfect yogic state), yet one ought not to trust
them; for, it is generally seen, many imperfect Yogins find themselves
disturbed by one or other of the senses. If the mind of one who has
already entered into the Sannyâsa Âs’ram gets perturbed in his course,
then, how can he, you can see this for yourself, satisfy desires of
eating good things, sleeping nicely, seeing his son, or wishing any
other desires, knowing them to lead to his degradation? He is then in a
very serious state. The net of desires is very difficult to be conquered
by men; that can never die out. Therefore, to put an end to them, the
advise is to cut them slowly and slowly. He who sleeps on an elevated
place has the danger of tumbling down; but one who sleeps in a low place
has no such danger. So any man who has once taken the highest dharma
Sannyâsa, and if he be fallen, then he never gets hold of the real
track. As an ant begins to get from the root of tree, and, by and by,
gets to the topmost part of the branches, so human beings go by degrees
from one Âs'rama to another till they go to the highest; then and then
only they are able to get easily their desired truth. The birds without
anticipating any danger, get up to the skies very quickly and soon they
get tired and cannot go to their desired place but the ant goes with
rest to its desired place. This mind is very difficult to be controlled;
for this reason the men of unripened minds, cannot conquer it all at
once; and are advised to conquer it, by and by, observing the laws of
one Âs’rama after another.

 

31-37. See also if anybody, remaining in his household life be of a
quiet temper and of good intellect, and if he takes success and failure
in the same light, and be not elated in times of pleasure and not
depressed in times of pains and does his duty for duty’s sake without
troubling his mind with cares, and anxieties, then that householder
acquires pure happiness by the realisation of his self and acquires
Mok<u>s</u>ha. There is no manner of doubt in this. O Sinless One! See,
I am liberated while living, though I am engaged in preserving kingdom;
if any source of pain or pleasure arises, I am not in any way affected
by them. As I will attain in the end Videha Mukti (liberation from
bodies) though I am always wandering at my free will, enjoying various
things as I like

 

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

 

and do various things as it pleases me, so you can do your duties and
then be liberated in the end.

 

O Son of my Guru! When this material world, the cause of all error
according to the Vedanta S’âstras, is simply an object of sight then how
can this material substance, an object of sight, be the source of
bondage to the Âtman, the Self? O Brâhman! Though the five material
elements can be seen, their qualities or Gu<u>n</u>as can be known only
by inference, so the self is to be inferred; it can never be an object
of sight; and also this self, known by inference, changeless and without
any impurity or stain can never be bound by the visible changeful
material thing. O Brâhman! This impure heart is the source of all
pleasure and pains; so when the heart becomes pure and quiet, all the
things then become fully pure, O Brâhma<u>n</u>a!

 

38-41. If going often and often to all Tiraths and bathing there, do not
make one's heart pure and holy, then all one's troubles are taken in
vain. O Destroyer of enemies! It is the mind that is the cause of
bondage or freedom; and not the body, nor the Jivâtmâ (the embodied
soul), nor the senses. The Self or Âtman is always pure consciousness
and is ever free so, truly speaking, it can never be bound. Bondage and
freedom reside on in the mind; so when the Mind gets peace, the bondage
of Samsâra is also at an end. He is an enemy, he is a friend, he is
neither an enemy nor friend, all these different thoughts reside in the
mind and arise out of duality; how can the ideas of differences exist,
when everything has become all one pervading self?

 

42-47. Jîva is Brahmâ; I am that Brahmâ and nothing else; there is
nothing to be discussed here. It is owing to the dualities that monism
appears not clear and differences between Jîva and Brahmâ arise. O
Mahâbhâga! This difference is due to Avidyâ and by which this difference
vanishes, that is termed Vidyâ.

 

This difference between Vidyâ and Avidyâ ought to be always kept in
view, by those that are clever.

 

How can the pleasure from the cooling effect of the shadow, be felt, if
the heating effect of the rays of the Sun be not previously experienced?
So how Vidyâ is to be experienced if Avidyâ be not felt before? Sattva,
Rajas and Tamo Gu<u>n</u>as reside naturally in things, made of
Gu<u>n</u>as; and the five principal elements reside naturally in
substances made up of elements; so the senses reside naturally in their
own forms, etc.; so how can there be any stain to the Âtman which is
unattached? Yet to teach humanity, the high souled persons preserve
always with greatest care the respect of the Vedas. If they do not do
this, then, O Sinless One! the ignorant persons would act lawlessly
according to their wishes, like

 

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

 

the Chârvâkas; and Dharma will become extinct. When Dharma will become
extinct, the Var<u>n</u>âs’rama will gradually die out; so the
well-wishers should always follow the path of the Vedas.

 

48-56. S’ûka said :-- “O King! I have now heard all that you have said;
still my doubt remains; it is not solved. O King! In the Dharma of the
Vedas, there is Himsâ (act of killing and injuring); and we hear that
there is much of Adharma (sin) in the above Himsâ.

 

So how can the Dharma of the Vedas give Mok<u>s</u>ha? O King! One can
see before one's eyes that the drinking of Soma rasa, the killing of
animals, the eating of fish and flesh and so are advised in the Vedas;
so much so that in the sacrificial ceremony named Sautrâma<u>n</u>a the
rule of drinking wine and many other vratas are clearly mentioned; even
gambling is advised in the Vedas. So how can Mukti be obtained by
following the Veda Dharma? It is heard that, in ancient times, there was
a great king, named S'as'avindu, very religious, truthful, and
performing sacrifices, very liberal; he protected the virtuous, and
chastised those that were wicked and going astray. He performed many
Yajñas, where many cows and sheep were sacrificed according to the rules
of the Vedas and abundant Dakshi<u>n</u>âs (sacrificial fees) were
presented to every one that performed their parts in the sacrifices. In
these sacrifices, the hides of the cows that were sacrificed as victims,
were heaped to such an enormous extent that they looked liked a second
Bindhyâchal mountain. Then the rains fell and the dirty water coming out
of that enormous heap of skins flowed down and gave rise to a river
which was thence called the Charma<u>n</u>vatî river. And what a wonder?
That cruel king left behind him an ineffaceable fame and went to
Heavens. Whatever it may be, it can never come to my head that I should
perform the Veda Dharma, filled with so many acts of killing and
cruelties. Again, when the man find pleasure in sexual intercourses and
when they do not have that intercourse, they experience pain, how can
you expect such persons to attain liberation.”

 

57-61. Janaka said :-- “The killing of animals in a sacrificial ceremony
is not killing; it is known as Ahimsâ; for that himsâ is not from any
selfish attachment; therefore when there is no such sacrifice and the
animals are killed out of selfish attachment, then that is real himsâ;
there is no other opinion in this. Smoke arises from a fire when fuels
are placed in it; and smoke is not seen when no fuel is added. So, O
Munisattama! The himsâ, as prescribed in the Vedas, is free from all
blemishes, selfish attachment, etc., and therefore it is unblameable. So
it follows the himsâ committed by persons attached to objects, is the
real himsâ; that can be blamed, but the himsâ of those persons who

 

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

 

have no desires is not that sort of himsâ. Therefore the learned men
that know the Vedas declare that the himsâ done by the dispassionate
persons, with their hearts free from egoism, is no himsâ done at all. O
Dvija! Really speaking, the killing of animals done by the house-holder
attached to senses and their objects, and done under their impulses can
be taken into account as a real act of killing; but, O Mahâbhâga of
those whose hearts are not attached to anything of those self controlled
persons, desirous of mok<u>s</u>a, if they do an act of Himsâ out of a
sense of duty, with no desires of fruits and with their hearts free from
egoism that can never be reckoned as a real act of killing.”

 

Thus ends the 18th Chapter of the 1st Skandha on Janaka's giving
instructions on truth to S’ûka Deva in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rîmad
Devî Bhâgavatam.
