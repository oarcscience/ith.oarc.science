1-10. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus making a firm resolve that there would
be either victory or death, the great warrior Nis’umbha went to fight
with the Devî, with great excitement and with all his forces. S’umbha,
too the Lord of the Daityas, accompanied by his forces, went after
Nis’umbha; S’umbha knew full well the rules of warfare; therefore he
remained a witness there. Indra and the other Devas and Yak<u>s</u>as,
all stationed themselves in the celestial space, eager to see that
fight, covered with clouds. Nis’umbha came to the field, and, taking the
strong bow made of horns, began to shoot arrows after arrows at the
Divine Mother with the object of frightening Her. Seeing Nis’umbha with
his excellent bow, shooting arrows, Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ began to laugh
frequently. With a soft slow voice She spoke to Kâlikâ :-- “O Kâlî! See
their foolishness! They have come before me, courting death. They are so
much deluded by My Mâyâ, that they yet expect victory when they have
already witnessed the death of Raktabîja and many Dânavas. Hope is so
very strong that it never quits a man. How wonderful is this that some
of their armies are destroyed, some are wounded, some are rendered
senseless, some made powerless, some have fled; seeing all these, yet,
they have come to fight, as it were, fastened by the cord of hope of
victory. O Kâlî! Today I will certainly slay Nis’umbha and S’umbha.
Their death is nigh; deluded by the Daivî Mâyâ, they have come to Me.
Therefore, in the face of all the Devas, I will kill them today.”

 

11-24. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus saying, and suddenly drawing Her bow,
Cha<u>nd</u>î covered Nis’umbha, in front, all over with a multitude of
arrows. Nis’umbha, too, cut off those arrows into pieces by his sharp
arrows; thus the fight became more and more dreadful between them. At
this time, the lion of Bhagavatî, came down upon the forces, quivering
his manes, like a powerful elephant going down into a lake. By his nails
and teeth, he tore asunder the bodies of the Dânavas that fell before
him and devoured them, as if they were infatuated elephants. That lion
thus crushing down the soldiers, Nis’umbha came forward hurriedly,
drawing his excellent bow. Hundreds of other generals of the Dânavas
came up there to kill the Devî, biting their lips and with their eyes
reddened with anger. In the meantime S’umbha killed Kâlikâ and came very
hurriedly there with his forces to capture the Divine Mother. Coming to
the battlefield S’umbha saw that the Divine Mother was

standing before him; though She was looking very beautiful, fit for love
sentiment, yet She was filled also with the sentiment of fiery wrath. At
that time the large eyes of Bhagavatî, the Beautiful in the three
worlds, though naturally red, looked more red due to wrath. When S’umbha
saw Her lovely features, the desire to marry Her and the hope of victory
all vanished away from his mind; and he stood there with bow in his
hand, firmly holding in his mind that he would die. Seeing the Dânava in
that state, She smiled and began to say, so that all the Dânavas could
hear. O Wretched Fools! If you all want to live, quit all your weapons
here, go to the Pâtâla or to the middle of the ocean. Or be slain in the
battle by My arrows and go to heavens and enjoy there without any fear
all the enjoyments and sports there. Weakness and heroism, both cannot
be expected at one and the same time and at the same individual;
therefore I am ordering you to dispel your fears. Now go wherever you
find your ease and happiness.

 

25-35. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of the Devî, that
haughty Nis’umbha ran forward, holding in his hand the sharpened axe and
shield adorned with eight Cha<u>nd</u>ras (embossed) and firstly struck
with sword violently on the proud lion; then, whirling with great force
that sword, hurled it upon the Divine Mother. The Devî, then, thwarted
off the blow of the sword by Her club and struck at his arm by Paras’u.
The warrior Nis’umbha, thus struck at his arm, patiently bore that hurt
and struck at Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ by his axe. The Devî then made such a
terrible noise of bells that all the Daityas were struck with terror.
Then She, desiring to kill Nis’umbha, began to drink nectar frequently.
O King! Thus the terrible fight went on between the Devas and Dânavas
both trying to defeat the other party. Then began to dance in the
battlefield, the cruel voracious dogs, jackals, vultures, herons, crows
and other birds, very much gladdened. The battlefield was drenched with
blood and the dead carcasses of innumerable Dânavas, elephants, and
horses. Nis’umbha, then, seeing the Dânavas dead on the field, became
very angry and ran forward with his terrible club before the Devî. That
proud Asura struck first at the head of the lion with that club and
laughed again and again and struck the Devî with that same club. The
Devî, too, got very angry seeing Nis’umbha before Her and striking

at Her. She then spoke thus :--

 

36\. O You Stupid! Wait till I sever your head from your body by this
axe. Soon you will be sent unto death with your head severed off your
body.

 

37-64. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus saying the Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ Devî
instantly cut off the head of Nis’umbha by Her axe with great caution.

The head thus severed from the body by the blow of the Devî, the
headless Demon began to roam there with great force with club in his
hand. The Devas then got very much frightened; The Devî, then, cut off
the hands and feet of that headless Demon with sharpened arrows. That
vicious wretch fell down lifeless, on the ground like a mountain. The
powerful Daitya Nis’umbha being thus killed, a great uproar arose amidst
his panic stricken forces. The soldiers, covered all over their bodies
with blood, left all their weapons in the field, began to make Boombâ
sound (a piteous cry with mouth and hands as sign of danger) and fled
away to the King S’umbha. He, the tormentor of the foes, then asked them
coming :-- “Where is Nis’umbha now? Why have you fled away from the
field?” Thus hearing the King’s words, they bowed down and said :--  O
King! Your brother Nis’umbha is lying dead on the battlefield. O King!
The Devî killed all the Dânava warriors that attended your brother; only
we are left and have come here to give you the information. O King!
Nis’umbha has been killed by the weapons of the Devî. So we think you
ought not to go to the battle. Know this as certain that the Lady, the
Highest Cause of this Universe has come here to destroy the Dânavas, the
object being to serve the cause of the Gods. This Lady is not an
ordinary woman; She is the Supreme Force; Her doings are inconceivable;
what more can be said than the fact that the Devas never can know Her!
This Devî can assume various forms; She is the origin of Mâyâ; She is
very clever; She is adorned with various ornaments and is holding
various weapons in Her hands. Her doings are incomprehensible; She is
like a Second Night of Dissolution (at the end of the world); She is
Perfect, endowed with all auspicious signs, capable to go beyond the
insurmountable. This wonderful Devî is serving the cause of the gods and
the Devas from the sky are singing hymns to Her. O King! It is now your
paramount duty to fly away and save your life; if you live, you may have
the chance for gaining the victory when time will turn out favourable;
there is no doubt in this. It is Time that makes a strong man weak; and
it is that very Time that makes that weak man strong again and
stimulates him for victory. Time makes a generous donor a beggar and it
is Time that makes the same beggar again a generous donor. Brahmâ,
Vi<u>sn</u>u, Mahes’a, Indra and other Devas are all under the sway of
this Time; so Time is the Sovereign of all. Therefore, O King! Wait for
this Time. Now Time is favourable to the Gods and inimical to you.
Therefore Time is destroying now the Daityas. But the course of Time is
not the same throughout. O King! The actions of Time are various no
doubt. Time creates men and Time destroys them. The time of

 

<span id="page_461">p. 461</span>

 

creation is different from the time of destruction, this is evident to
you before your eyes. See! When Time was favourable to you, you subject
Indra and all other Devas and made them pay taxes to you; and now Time
is unfavourable to you; so an ordinary weak woman is killing the
powerful Dânavas; Time, therefore, is doing favourable things and also
unfavourable things. The host of Devas or the woman Kâlî is not the
cause thereof. O King! The present Time is not favourable to you and the
Daityas; knowing this, do as you like. See! Indra, Vi<u>sn</u>u,
Varu<u>n</u>a, Yama and other prominent Devas all fled before in battle,
quitting the weapons. So, knowing this world as subject to the control
of Time, you can now fly away and go quickly to the Pâtâla. For if you
live, you will get in future all the pleasures; and if you be killed,
your enemies will all be very glad and roam everywhere fearlessly,
singing propitious songs.

 

Here ends the Thirtieth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the killing of
Nis’umbha in S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam, the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am, of
18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
