1-2. Janamejaya spoke :-- O Dvîja! I have heard in detail the Devî
Yajña, performed by S’rî Vi<u>sn</u>u. Now describe Her Glory and
glorious deeds. After hearing these, the Devî’s glorious deeds, I will
also perform that, the best of all sacrifices. Thereby I will no doubt
be pure through your favour.

 

3\. Vyâsa said :-- O king! Hear, I am describing to you the history of
the most auspicious mighty deeds of the Devî, according to the
Purâ<u>n</u>as.

 

4-5. In days of yore, there reigned in the country of Kosala, the king
Dhruvasandhi of the Solar Dynasty. He was the son of Pu<u>s</u>pa and
cele-

brated on account of his great prowess. He was truthful, religious,
engaged in doing good to his subjects, obeying the laws of the four
castes and Âs’ramas. He being pure, performed his regal duties in the
flourishing city of Ayodhyâ.

 

6\. The Brâhma<u>n</u>as, K<u>s</u>attriyas, Vais'yas, and S’ûdras and
other good persons all lived religiously under his rule, each abiding by
his own profession.

 

7\. No thieves, cheats, cunning persons, vain and arrogant persons,
treacherous and illiterate men were allowed to remain in his kingdom.

 

8\. O host of Kurus! Thus ruling virtuously, the king had two wives,
both of them young, fair and beautiful and well able to give delights
and enjoyments to the king.

 

9\. The first and lovely wife was Manoramâ, and the second was Lîlâvatî.
Both of them were exceedingly handsome, intelligent and qualified.

 

10\. The king enjoyed much with them in palaces, gardens, romantic
hills, lakes, and various beautiful mansions.

 

11\. In the auspicious moment, Manoramâ gave birth to a beautiful child,
endowed with all royal qualifications. The child was named, in due
course, Sudars’ana.

 

12\. Next within one month, his second wife the fair Lîlâvatî in the
auspicious fortnight and in the auspicious day, gave birth to an
excellent child.

 

13\. The King then performed the Jâta-Karma (ceremonies on the birth of
a child) and being very glad, made lots of presents, wealth, etc., to
the Brâhma<u>n</u>as.

 

14\. The King shewed affection equally to the two children; never he
made any distinction between them.

 

15\. The king, the tormenter of the foes, was very glad and performed
duly the chu<u>d</u>â kara<u>n</u>a ceremony according to his position
and wealth.

 

16\. The sight of these two sons delighted very much the people. Now
seeing these Kritachû<u>d</u>as, and playing, the king was merged in the
ocean of pleasure.

 

17-18. Sudars'ana was the eldest; but Satrujit, the second beautiful son
by Lîlâvatî was of sweet and persuasive speech. His beautiful figure and
sweet words gave very much delight to the king, and for these qualities,
the child Satrujit turned out also a favourite of the people and
ministers.

 

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

 

19\. The king could not show so much affection to the unfortunate
Sudars’ana as he showed to Satrujit.

 

20-21. Thus some days having passed, one day the king Dhruvasandhi went
out on an hunting expedition to the forest. He killed in the forest many
deer, Ruru (a kind of deer), elephants, boar, hare, buffaloes,
rhinoceros, camels and amused himself very much with this hunting
affair.

 

22-23. While he was hunting thus, a lion got very much enraged, and,
from a bush, suddenly jumped and came upon the king. That king of the
beasts was already struck with arrows; now seeing the king in front, he
loudly roared.

 

24-25. He angrily lifted his long tail high up in the air and, puffing
up his manes, jumped up high in the air to attack and to take the life
of the king. Seeing this, instantly the king took sword in his right
hand and shield in his left and stationed himself like another lion
before him.

 

26\. The king's followers, one and all, angrily shot arrows on the lion.

 

27\. Then a loud uproar ensued; and all began to hurl arrows as best as
they could. But, after all, that dangerous lion fell upon the king.

 

28-29. Seeing thus, the king struck him with his sword, but the lion
also tore asunder the king, with his sharp nails. The king thus struck
by the lion, fell on the spot and died. The soldiers cried aloud and
killed the lion with arrows.

 

30\. Thus both the king and lion lay dead on the spot; and the soldiers
turned back to the palace and gave all the informations to the royal
ministers.

 

31\. When the munis heard the demise of the king, they went to the
forest, performed the burning of the dead body of the king.

 

32\. The Mahar<u>s</u>i Vas’i<u>st</u>ha performed duly on the same
spot, all the funeral ceremonies, thus ensuring the king the safe
journey to the next world.

 

33\. All the subjects and the citizens and the Muni Vas’i<u>st</u>ha
counselled each other to install Sudars’ana on the throne as the king.

 

34-35. The minister-in-chief as well as the other members proposed that
as Sudars’ana is the son of the legal wife, calm and quiet, beautiful
and endowed with all the royal qualifications, he is fit for the throne.
Mahar<u>s</u>i Vas’i<u>st</u>ha said, the royal son, though not attained
to proper age is still religious; therefore he is really fit be
installed as king on the royal throne.

 

36\. When the wise aged ministers thus decided, Yudhâjit, the king of
Ujjain, on hearing the decision hastened to the spot.

 

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

 

37\. He was the father of Lîlâvatî; on hearing the demise of his
son-in-law he came there, so that his daughter’s son might get the
kingdom.

 

38\. Next, Vîrasena, the king of the country of Kalinga and the father
of Manoramâ, came there also with the object that his daughter’s son
Sudars’ana be the Emperor.

 

39\. The two kings, accompanied respectively by their own army and
soldiers, began to counsel with the aged ministers, each trying so that
his daughter’s son may get the throne.

 

40\. Yudhâjit made the question :-- “Who is the eldest of the two sons?
Is it always the case that the eldest will inherit the kingdom? Will not
the youngest ever be able to acquire it?”

 

41\. Vîrasena said :-- O king! He who is the son of the legal wife
inherits the kingdom; this I have heard from the learned who are
proficient in the knowledge of the S’âstras.

 

42\. Hearing Vîrasena, Yudhâjit repeated “Sudars’ana is not so qualified
with royal qualifications and other matters as this son of the late
king, Satrujit. How can then Sudars’ana inherit the throne?”

 

43\. O King! Then quarrels ensued amongst the two kings. Now, at this
critical juncture, who is able to solve their doubts?

 

44\. Yudhâjit then addressed the ministers :-- “You all are prompted by
selfish ends; you want to acquire a good deal of money by making
Sudars’ana the king.

 

45-46. I have come to know by your gestures and postures that your
decision is to the above affect. After all, as Satrujit possesses many
more qualifications than Sudars’ana, he has more claims to the throne;
and therefore he is fit to occupy the throne and no other. Morever, let
me see as long as I live who can set aside the claims of a qualified
prince, in possession of an army, and put forward the claims of a prince
who has no qualifications it all.

 

47\. I am ready to fight and I will tear the earth into two pieces by my
sword. What more have you to say on this?”

 

48\. Hearing this, Vîrasena addressed Yudhâjit “I see the two boy’s
intelligence the same. You are intelligent; kindly mention where is the
difference?”

 

49\. O king! The two kings quarrelling with each other, remained there;
the subjects and the Ri<u>s</u>is, seeing this, were very anxious.

 

50\. Hundreds of tributary princes wanting that the two kings might be

 

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

 

involved into quarrels with each other, came to the spot, with their
soldiers, though they had to undergo great hardships in doing so.

 

51\. Many aborigines, from the inhabitants of Sringaverpur, hearing the
demise of the late king, also appeared on the scene with the sole object
to plunder.

 

52\. The two princes are minors; and hearing their parties at war with
each other, many robbers from various adjoining countries came also
there.

 

53\. Thus when the war broke out between the two kings, the great
confusion and tumult across within the kingdoms; on the other hand,
Yudhâjit and Vîrasena both became ready to fight.

 

Thus ends the Fourteenth Chapter on the narration of the glories of the
Devî and the death of the Kosala king Dhruva Sandhi in the 3rd Adhayâya
of S'rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam.
