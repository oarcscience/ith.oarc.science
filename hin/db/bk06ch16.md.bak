1-5. Janamejaya said :-- In whose family were born those
K<u>s</u>attriya Haihayas that killed in ancient times the Bhârgavas,
disregardless of the sin incurred in killing a Brâhmi<u>n</u>? O
Grandsire! Never do the good persons become angry without a serious
cause; therefore kindly state why they got angry. How was the enmity
caused between them and the priests? As far as I can think, the cause is
not so simple a one as led to this enmity between the K<u>s</u>attriyas
and the priests. Otherwise why then would they slay the offenseless
Brâhmi<u>n</u>s, fit to be worshipped; and how was it that the
K<u>s</u>attriyas, though they were so very powerful, did not fear to
commit a sin. O Muni! Can any K<u>s</u>attriya Chief kill a
Brâhmi<u>n</u>, worthy of the highest respect, merely on a trifling
cause! Describe to me, then, how this happened. A great doubt has thus
arisen in my mind.

 

6\. Sûta said :-- O Ri<u>s</u>is! Vyâsa, the son of Satyavatî, became
very pleased when he was asked this question by Janamejaya, and,
recollecting the whole course of events regarding the Haihayas, began to
narrate it.

 

7-22. Vyâsa said :-- O son of Parik<u>si</u>t! I will now narrate that
wonderful story of old that I know fully; now hear this very
attentively. In ancient times there was a King named Kârtavîryârjuna of
the family of Haihaya. He was of thousand hands, powerful, and always
ready to observe religious duties. He was the incarnation of Hari, and
the disciple of Mahar<u>s</u>i Dattâtreya and the worshipper of the
Supreme Force (Âdyâ S’akti). He was well known as a perfect adept in the
Yoga practices and of a very charitable disposition. But this King was
the client of the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s of the Bhârgava clan. He was always
devoted to performing sacrifices, exceedingly religious, and always
engaged in making gifts. So many a time did he perform the great
sacrifices and gave a profuse quantity of wealth to the Bhârgavas. Due
to the gifts and presents of Kârta Vîrya, the Bhârgava priests became
possessed of many horses, and gems and jewels and so became wealthy and
prosperous on the surface of this earth. O King! When Kârtavîryârjuna,
the best of Kings, left the mortal coil and got up to Heavens, his
descendants became entirely void of any wealth

by the indomitable influence of Time. Now, on a certain occasion, the
Haihayas had to perform certain actions which necessitated a vast sum of
money; they came to the Bhârgavas and humbly prayed for a very large
amount of wealth. But the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s, out of their greed of money,
replied they had no money and thus they did not give any money
whatsoever. Rather the Bhârgavas thought that the Haihayas would
perforce take their wealth, and, fearing thus, some of them buried all
their valuables underneath the ground; and others gave as charities to
the Brâhma<u>n</u>as. The greedy Bhârgavas, bewildered with fear, thus
transferred all their properties elsewhere, quitted their homes and fled
away to mountains and other places. The greedy Brâhmi<u>n</u>s did not
give any wealth to their Yajamânas (their clients) though they saw them
very much distressed; but they fled away out of fear to mountains and
fastnesses where they found shelter. At last the Haihayas, the best of
the K<u>s</u>attriyas, became very sorry till, at last, for the sake of
their good actions, they went to the Bhârgavas’ houses for the sake of
money and found they had quitted their homes and fled away; their homes
were all vacant. Then they began to dig underneath their houses for
money and some got the money thus. Then the K<u>s</u>attriyas began to
labour hard and got hordes of money from underneath the ground. Next
they raided upon other Brâhma<u>n</u>as’ houses and dug and excavated
and searched for more money. The Brâhmi<u>n</u>s were helpless and,
crying, all took their refuge, out of fear, under the Bhârgavas.

 

23-42. The K<u>s</u>attriyas made an exhaustive search of the
Brâhma<u>n</u>as’ houses and got lots of money. They then charged the
Brâhma<u>n</u>as as having had spoken falsehood and they became very
angry, and killed the Brâhma<u>n</u>as with arrows who took their
refuge. O King! The Haihayas were so very angry at that time that they
went wherever the Bhârgavas took their shelter and cut asunder the
foetus in the wombs of their Bhârgavas’ wives and thus they roamed all
over on the surface of the earth. Wherever they saw any Bhârgava, be he
a minor, or a youth or a old man, at once they killed him with sharp
arrows, disregarding the sin Brahmahattyâ. When the Bhârgavas were thus
all killed, then they caught hold of their wives that were pregnant and
destroyed their wombs. When the vicious K<u>s</u>attriyas thus destroyed
the lives in their wombs, the helpless women began to cry like the
awe-stricken ewe. Then the other Munis, the inhabitants of the sacred
places of pilgrimages, seeing the Haihaya K<u>s</u>attriyas inflamed
with anger, said :-- “O K<u>s</u>attriyas! Quit your terrible anger
towards the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s. Being the best of the K<u>s</u>attriyas,
you are killing the foetus in the wombs of the pregnant Brâhma<u>n</u>a
ladies! You are doing, no doubt, a very vicious and unjustifiable act!
You should

know that an act, very bad or very good, bears fruit in this life;
therefore those that seek their welfare should entirely omit this
exceedingly hateful and vicious act.” Then the exceedingly angry
Haihayas told the merciful ascetics :-- You all are saints; therefore
you do not know the real import of what are called vicious acts. Those
Bhârgavas, thoroughly dexterous in cunning pursuits, deceived our
largehearted forefathers and stole away all their gold and jewels, as
thieves do with a passerby on a road. These Bhârgavas are cheats, vain
persons and their persuasions are like herons. A great act had to be
done by us and we wanted money at 25 per cent interest with all the
becoming humility; yet they did not give us the money; rather seeing on
their face their clients distressed and sorrowful they spoke that they
had no money, no money and then they remained silent. True, they got all
their money from Kârtavîrya; but it may be questioned why they stored
it? Why did not they perform sacrifices with that? Why did not they give
sufficient money to the other priests (Yâyakas) that did the sacrifices.
Never should any Brâhmi<u>n</u> hoard his money; he should give that in
charity and enjoy at his pleasure. O Twice-born! In amassing wealth,
there exist three fears :-- Fear from the thieves and robbers, fear from
the King, fear from dreadful fire accidents, and especially great
terrible fear from the cheats. This is the nature of wealth; it leaves
its preserver. See, moreover, when a hoarder of money dies, he certainly
has to quit it. If a wealthy man, before dying, performs sacrifices and
other good pious acts by his earned money, then he gets certainly good
states in future; otherwise, he quits his wealth, to no purpose and
earns a bad state in his future life; there is no doubt in this. We
humbly wanted to pay a quarter interest and asked money for the
performance of a great act; yet they, the greedy ones, were doubtful
about our promise; and though our priests, they did not give us the
money. O Mahar<u>s</u>is! Gift, enjoyment and destruction, these are the
three courses which any wealth has to pass through; those persons that
have done good deeds, enjoy their wealth and give as charities and thus
they make a good and real use of their money; and of those that are
vicious, their wealth goes away in ruin and to no purpose. He who does
not enjoy nor give in charities but is only clever in hoarding and who
is a miser, the Kings punish him by all means, that man who cheats
himself and who suffers only pains and miseries. For that reason, we are
now ready to kill those Brâhmi<u>n</u>s, the vilest of men, the cheats,
though they are our Gurus. O Mahar<u>s</u>is! You are great persons;
therefore you do not be angry after you have come to know all these.

 

43-51. Vyâsa said :-- Thus consoling the Munis, with reasonable words,
the Haihayas began to roam about, in search of the wives of the

 

<span id="page_541">p. 541</span>

 

Bhârgavas. The Bhârgava wives were very much distressed with fear and
became very lean and thin. They fled away to the Himâlayân Mountain
weeping, and crying, and trembling with fear. Thus the Bhârgavas were
being killed by those vicious greedy Haihayas, infuriated with anger,
and as they liked. O King! This greed is the greatest enemy of a man,
residing in his own body; this greed is the root of all evils, of all
sins. Life is in danger due to this covetousness. It is due to this
greed that quarrels ensue amongst the several castes, the
Brâhmi<u>n</u>s, etc., and that the human beings are very much troubled
with thirst after worldly enjoyments. This greed makes a man forsake all
his religious rites and long existing customs and observances of his
family; and it is due to this avarice of gold that men kill their
fathers, mothers, brothers, friends, Gurus, sons, acquaintances,
sisters, and sisters-in-law and others. Really when a man is bent on
avarice, nothing heinous remains to him that cannot be done by him. This
greed is a more powerful enemy than anger, lust and egoism. O King! Men
abandon their lives for their greed; what more can be said than this? So
one should be always alert on this. O King! Your forefathers, the
Pâ<u>nd</u>avas and Kauravas, were all religious and they followed the
path of virtue and goodness. Yet they all were ruined simply for this
greed. See! The dreadful fight and separation amongst the relatives took
place where there were the high-souled persons like Bhî<u>s</u>ma,
Dro<u>n</u>a, Kripâchârya, Kar<u>n</u>a, Vahlika, Bhîmasena,
Yudhi<u>st</u>hira, Arju<u>n</u>a, and Kes’ava, only through the
avaricious feelings. In this battle Bhî<u>s</u>ma, Dro<u>n</u>a and the
sons of Pâ<u>nd</u>avas were all slain; the brothers and fathers were
all slain in battle. Thus what improper acts and mischiefs can there be
that cannot be committed when the human minds are overpowered by this
greed? O King! The vicious Haihayas slew the Bhârgavas all through this
avarice.

 

Here ends the Sixteenth Chapter in the Sixth Book on the incidents
preliminary to the Haihaya and Bhârgava affairs in the
Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda
Vyâsa.
