1-21. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- Brahmâ, then putting S’iva to the task of
killing S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a went to His own abode. The other Devas
returned to their homes. Here under the beautiful Ba<u>t</u>a tree, on
the banks of the river Chandrabhâgâ, Mahâdeva pitched His big tent and
encamped Himself to get the victory of the Devas. He then sent
Chitraratha, the Lord of the Gandharbhas, as a messenger to
S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a, the Lord of the Dânavas. By the command of
Mahâdeva, Chitraratha went to the city of the king of Daityas, more
beautiful than Indra’s place and more wealthy than the mansion of
Kuvera. The city was five yojanas wide and twice as much in length. It
was built of crystals of pearls and jewels. There were roadways on all
sides. There were seven trenches, hard to be crossed, one after another,
encircling the city. The city was built of countless rubies and gems,
brilliant like flames. There were hundreds of roadways and markets and
stalls, in the wonderful Vedis (raised platforms) built of jewels. All
around were splendid palatial buildings of traders and merchantmen,
filled with various articles. There were hundreds and ko<u>t</u>is of
beautiful buildings, adorned with various ornaments and built of
variegated red stones looking like Sindûras. Thus he went on and saw, in
the middle, the building of S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a, circular like the lunar
sphere. Four ditches all filled with fiery flames, encircled one after
another, his house. So the enemies could not in any way cross them; but
the friend could easily go there. On the top were seen turrets built of
jewels, rising high to the heavens. The gate-keepers were watching the
twelve gates. In the centre were situated lakhs and lakhs of excellent
jewel built houses. In every room there were jewelled steps and
staircases and the pillars were all built of gems and jewels, and
pearls. Pu<u>s</u>padanta (Chitraratha) saw all this and then went to
the first gate and saw one terrible person, copper coloured, with tawny
eyes, sitting with a trident in his hand and with a smiling countenance.
He told he had come as a messenger and got his entrance. Thus
Chitraratha went one afer another to all the entries, not being
prohibited at all though he told that he had come as a messenger on war
service. The Gandharbha reached one after another, the last door and
said :-- “O Door keeper! Go quickly and inform the Lord of the Dânavas
all about the impending war.” When the messenger had spoken thus, the
gate-keeper allowed him to go inside. Going inside, the Gandarbha saw
S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a, of excellent form, seated in the middle of the
royal assembly, on a golden

throne. One servant was holding on the king’s head an umbrella, decked
with divine excellent gems, the inner rod of the umbrella being made up
of jewels, and decorated with expanded artificial flowers made of gems.
The attendants were fanning him with beautiful white châmaras; he was
nicely dressed, beautiful and lovely and adorned with jewel ornaments.
He was nicely garlanded, and wore fine celestial garments. Three
Ko<u>t</u>i Dânavas were surrounding him; and seven Ko<u>t</u>i Dânavas,
all armed, were walking to and fro.

 

22-53. Pu<u>s</u>padanta was thunderstruck when he saw thus the Dânava
and he addressed him thus :-- O King! I am a servant of S’iva; My name
is Pu<u>s</u>padanta; hear what S’iva has commanded me to tell you. You
better now give back, to the Devas, the rights that they had before. The
Devas went to S’rî Hari and had taken His refuge. S’rî Hari gave over to
S’iva one S’ûla weapon and asked the Devas to depart. At present, the
three eyed Deva is residing under the shade of a Ba<u>t</u>a tree on the
banks of the Pu<u>s</u>pabhadrâ river. He told me to speak this to you,
“Either give over to the Devas their rights, or fight with me. Please
reply and I will speak to Him accordingly.” S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a, hearing
the messenger’s words laughed and said, “Tomorrow morning I will start,
ready for war. Better go away today.” The messenger went back to S’iva
and replied to Him accordingly. In the meantime the following personages
joined S’iva and remained seated on excellent aerial cars, built of
jewels and gems. The following were the persons :-- Skanda, Vîrabhadra,
Nandî, Mahâkâla, Subhadraka, Vis’âlâk<u>s</u>a, Bâ<u>n</u>a,
Pingalâk<u>s</u>a, Vikampana, Virûpa, Vikriti, Ma<u>n</u>ibhadra,
Vâskâla, Kapilâk<u>s</u>a, Dîrgha Da<u>n</u>g<u>st</u>ra, Vika<u>t</u>a,
Tâmralochana, Kâlâka<u>nt</u>ha, Balîbhadra, Kâlajîhba,
Ku<u>t</u>îchara, Balonmatta, Ra<u>n</u>as’lâghî, Durjaya, Durgama,
(these eight Bhairavas), eleven Rudras, eight Vasus, Indra, the twelve
Âdityas, fire, moon, Vis’vakarmâ, the two As’vins, Kuvera, Yama,
Jayanta, Nala Kûbara, Vâyu, Varu<u>n</u>a, Budha, Mangala, Dharma,
S’anî, Is’âna, the powerful Kâmadeva. Ugradam<u>st</u>râ,
Ugracha<u>n</u>dâ, Ko<u>t</u>arâ, Kai<u>t</u>abhî, and the eight armed
terrible Devî Bhadrakâlî. Kâlî wore the bloody red clothings and She
smeared red sandal paste all over Her body.

 

Dancing, laughing; singing songs in tune, very jolly, She bids Her
devotees discard all fear, and terrifies the enemies. Her lip is
terrible, lolling, and extends to one Yojana. On Her eight arms She
holds conch, disc, mace, lotus, axe, skin, bow and arrows. She was
holding in Her hands, the bowl shaped human skull; that was very deep
and one Yojana wide. Her trident reached up to the Heavens; Her weapon
called S’akti (dart) extended to one Yojana. Besides there were Mudgara

 

<span id="page_885">p. 885</span>

 

 (mace), Musala (club), Vajra (thunderbolt), Kheta (club), brilliant
Phalaka (shield), the Vai<u>sn</u>ava weapon, the Varu<u>n</u>a weapon,
the Âgneyâstra (the fire weapon), Nâgapâs’a (the noose of serpents), the
Nârâya<u>n</u>âstra, the Gandharva’s weapons, the Brahmâ’s weapons, the
Ga<u>d</u>u<u>d</u>âstram, the Pârjanayâstram, the Pâs’upatâstram, the
Jrimbhañâstram, the Pârvatâstram, the Mahes’varâstram, the Vâyavyâstram,
and the Sanmohanam rod and various other infallible divine weapons.
Besides hundreds of other divine weapons were with Her. Three
Ko<u>t</u>is of Yoginîs and three Ko<u>t</u>is and a half of terrible
Dâkinîs were attending Bhadrakâlî. Bhûtas, (demons) Pretas, Pis’âchas,
Kusmâ<u>n</u>das, Brahma Râk<u>s</u>asas, Râkh<u>s</u>asas, Vetâlas,
Yak<u>s</u>as and Kinnaras also were there in countless numbers. At this
time Kârtikeya came there and bowed down to his father Mahâdeva. He
asked him to take his seat on His left side an asked him to help. Then
the army remained there in military array. On the other hand, when
S’iva’s messenger departed, S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a went to the zenana and
informed Tulasî of the news of an impending war. No sooner She heard
than her throat and lips and palate became dried. She then with a
sorrowful heart spoke in sweet words :-- “O my Lord! O my Friend! O the
Ruler of My life! Wait for a moment and take your seat on My heart.
Instil life in Me for a moment. Satisfy My desire of human birth. Let me
behold you fully so that my eyes be satisfled. My breath is now very
agitated. I saw by the end of the night one bad dream. Therefore I feel
an internal burning.” Thus at the words of Tulasî, the king
S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a finished his meals and began to address her, in good
and true words, beneficent to her :-- “O My Lady! It is Kâla (the time
that brings out these various combinations by which the Karmic fruit is
enjoyed; it is Kâla that awards auspicious and inauspicious things; the
Kâla is the Sole Master to impart pain, fear, and good and bad things.

 

54-84. Trees grow up in time; their branches, etc., come out in time;
flowers appear in time and fruits come out in time. Fruits are ripen in
time and after giving the fruits, they die out also in time. O Fair One!
The universe comes into existence in time and dies away in time. The
Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer of the universe, are creating,
preserving and destroying the worlds with the help of time. Time guides
them in every way. But the Highest Prakriti is the God of Brahmâ,
Vi<u>sn</u>u, and Mahes’a (i.e., the Creatrix of Time). This Highest
Prakriti, the Highest God is creating, preserving and destroying this
universe. She makes the Time dance. By Her mere Will, She has converted
Her inseparable Prakriti into Mâyâ and is thus creating all things,
moving and unmoving. She is the Ruler of all; the Form of all, and She
is the Highest God. By Her is being done this creation of

 

<span id="page_886">p. 886</span>

 

persons by persons, this preservation of persons by persons, and this
destruction of persons by persons. So you better now take refuge of the
Highest Lord. Know it is by Her command the wind is blowing, by Her
command the Sun is giving heat in due time, by Her command Indra is
showering rains; by Her command, Death is striding over the beings; by
Her command fire is burning all things and by Her command the cooling
Moon is revolving. She is the Death of death, the Time of time, Yama of
yama (the God of death), the Fire of fire and the Destroyer of the
destroyer. So take Her refuge. You cannot find and fix who is whose
friend in the world; so pray to Her, the Highest God, Who is the Friend
of All. Oh! Who am I? And who are you either? The Creator is the
combiner of us two and so He will dissociate us two by our Karma. When
difficulty arises, the ignorant fools become overwhelmed with sorrow;
but the intelligent Pundits do not get at all deluded or become
distressed. By the Wheel of Time, the beings are led sometimes into
happiness; sometimes into pain. You will certainly get Nârâya<u>n</u>a
for your husband; for which you practised Tapas before, in the hermitage
of Vadari (the source of the Ganges, the feet of Vi<u>sn</u>u). I
pleased Brahmâ by my Tapasyâ and have, by his boon, got you as my wife.
But the object for which you did your Tapasyâ, that you may get Hari as
your husband; will certainly be fulfilled. You will get Gobinda in
Vrindâbana and in the region of Goloka. I will also go there when I
forsake this, my Demon body. Now I am talking with you here; afterwards
we will meet again in the region of Goloka. By the curse of Râdhikâ, I
have come to this Bhârata, hard to be attained. You, too, will quit this
body and, assuming the divine form will go to S’rî Hari. So, O Beloved!
You need not be sorry.” O Muni! Thus these conversations took them the
whole day and led them to the evening time. The king of the demons,
S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a then slept with Tulasî on a nicely decorated bed,
strewn with flowers, and smeared with sandal paste, in the Ratna Mandir
(temple built of jewels.) This jewel temple was adorned with various
wealth and riches. The jewel lamps were lighted. S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a
passed the night with his wife in various sports. The thin bellied
Tulasî was weeping with a very sorrowful heart, without having taken any
food. The king, who knew the reality of existence, took her to his
breast and appeased her in various ways. What religious instructions he
had received in Bhân<u>d</u>îra forest from S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, those
Tattvas, capable to destroy all sorrows and delusions, he now spoke
carefully to Tulasî. Then Tulasî’s joy knew no bounds. She then began to
consider, everything as transient and began to play with a gladdened
heart. Both became drowned in the ocean of bliss; and the bodies of both
of them were filled with joy

and the hairs stood on their ends. Both of them, then, desirous to have
amorous sports, joined themselves and became like Ardhanâris’vara and so
one body. As Tulasî considered S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a, to be her lord, so
the Dânava King considered Tulasî the darling of his life. They became
senseless with pleasureable feelings arising out of their amorous
intercourses. Next moment they regained their tenaciousness and both
began to converse on amorous matters. Thus both spent their time
sometimes in sweet conversations, sometimes laughing and joking,
sometimes maddened with amorous sentiments. As S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a was
clever in amorous affairs, so Tulasî was very expert. So none felt
satiated with love affairs and no one was defeated by the other.

 

Here ends the Twentieth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the war
preparations of S’ankhachû<u>d</u>a with the Devas in the
Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
