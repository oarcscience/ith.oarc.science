1-12. Sûta said :—Thus S’antanu married Satyavatî; two sons were born to
her and they died in course of time. Out of Vyâsa Deva's semen,
Dhritarâstra was born. Ambikâ Devî, the mother of Dhritarâstra closed
her eyes on seeing Veda Vyâsa; hence Dhritarâstra was born blind. Seeing
Dhritarâstra blind Satyavatî asked Vyâsa to go to Ambâlikâ
(Pân<u>d</u>u's mother); the princess Ambâlikâ, mother of Pân<u>d</u>u
turned pale at the sight of Vyâsa; hence her son became of a pale colour
out of Vyâsa's wrath. Hence the name of the son was Pân<u>d</u>u. Next
the maid servant, expert in the science of amorous pleasures, satisfied
Vyâsa; hence her son Vidura was born of Dharma's part and became
truthful and holy. Though Pân<u>d</u>u was younger, the ministers
installed him on the throne. Dhritarâstra could not become king, as he
was blind. By the permission of Bhîsma the powerful Pân<u>d</u>u
obtained the sovereignty; and the intelligent Vidura became his
minister. Dhritarâstra had two wives Gândhâri and Sauvali; this Sauvali
was Vaishyâ; she was engaged in the household affairs. The king
Pân<u>d</u>u had two wives, too; the first was Kunti, the daughter of
Sûrasena; and the other was Mâdri, the daughter of the Madra king.
Gândhâri gave birth to one hundred beautiful sons; Vais'yâ Sauvali gave
birth to one beautiful son named Yuyutsu. While Kunti was a virgin, she
gave birth, through the medium of the Sun, the lovely Karna; next he
became the wife of Pân<u>d</u>u. Hearing this, the Ri<u>s</u>is said :--
“O Muni Sûta! What are you saying ? First Kunti brought forth a child
and afterwards she was married to Pân<u>d</u>u; this

is wonderful, indeed! How was Karna, born of Kunti, unmarried? and how
came Kunti to be married afterwards? describe all these in detail.”

 

13-35. Sûta then said :-- “O Dvija! While Sûrasena's daughter Kunti was
a virgin girl, the king Kuntibhoja asked for Kunti that she might become
her girl and Sûrasena gave her to the king Kuntibhoja who brought up
this beautifully smiling girl. He put to her the service of Agni of
Agnihotra. Once, on an occassion, Durvâsâ Muni, engaged in the vow,
lasting for four months, came there; Kunti served him during that
period; the Muni became greatly pleased and gave her a very auspicious,
mantra, by virtue of which any Deva, when called upon by that mantra
will come to Kunti and satisfy her desires. When the Muni went away,
Kunti, remaining in her house, wanted to test the accuracy of the mantra
and asked within herself  “What Devatâ to call upon.” Seeing the God
Sûrya had arisen in the sky, Kunti uttered the Mantra and invoked him.
The Sun, then, assuming an excellent human form, came down from the
Heavens and appeared before Kunti in the same room. Seeing the Deva Sun,
Kunti became greatly surprised and began to shudder and instantly became
endowed with the inherent natural quality of passion (had menstruation).
The beautiful-eyed Kunti, with folded palm; spoke to Sûrya Deva standing
before :-- “I am highly pleased to-day seeing Thy form; now go back to
Thy sphere.”

 

Sûrya Deva said :-- “O Kunti! What for you called me, by virtue of the
Mantra? Calling me, why do you not worship me, standing before you? O
beautiful blue one! Seeing you, I have become passionate; so come to me.
By means of the mantra, you have made me your subservient so take me for
intercourse.” Hearing this, Kunti said :-- “O Witness of all! O knower
of Dharma! You know that I am a virgin girl. O Suvrata! I bow down to
you; I am a family daughter; so do not speak ill to me.” Sûrya then said
:-- “If I go away in vain, I will be an object of great shame, and, no
doubt, will be laughed amongst the gods; So, O Kunti! If you do not
satisfy me, I will immediately curse you and the Brâhmi<u>n</u> who has
given you this mantra. O Beautiful one! If you satisfy me, your
virginity will remain; no body will come to know and there will be born
a son to you, exactly like me.” Thus saying Sûrya Deva enjoyed the
bashful Kunti, with her mind attracted towards him; He granted her the
desired boons and went away. The beautiful Kunti became pregnant and
began to remain in a house, under great secrecy. Only the dear nurse
knew that; her mother or any other person was quite unaware of the fact.
In time, a very beautiful son like the second Sun and Kârtikeya, decked
with a lovely Kavacha coat of mail and two ear-rings, was born there.
Then the nurse caught hold

of the hand of the bashful Kunti and said :-- “O Charming one! What care
can you possibly have as            long as I am living.” Kunti then,
placed the son in a box and said :-- “O son! What shall I do? Being
afraid of shame, I am leaving you, though you are dear to me as my life
itself! I am exceedingly fortunate that I am casting aside this all
auspicious son. May the attributeless Bhâgavatî Ambikâ, the World Mother
and the Lady of all, endowed with attributes, protect Thee! May
Kâtyâyani, the giver of all desires, feed you with Her milk! Alas! I am
quitting you, born of Sûrya’s semen in this solitary forest like a
vitiated wanton woman. I do not know, when shall I see your lotus like
beautiful face, dearest to me like my self. Alas! I never worshipped in
my former birth S’ivânî, the mother of the three worlds; I never
meditated Her lotus like feet, the Giver of all happiness; hence I am so
very unfortunate. O Dear son! I must perform great tapasyâ to expiate
for this terrible sin, that I knowingly commit in relinquishing you in
the forest.”

 

36-48. Sûta said :-- Thus saying to the son within the casket, Kunti
gave over that to the hands of her nurse, terrified, lest some one might
see her. Kunti then bathed and remained with a fearful heart in her
father's house. A carpenter (charioteer?) named Adhiratha got
accidentally that casket floating in the Ganges. The carpenter's wife
Râdhâ, prayed for the son and nourished him under her care. Thus
nourished in the carpenter's house, the famous Kunti's son Karna became
a very powerful warrior. The king Pân<u>d</u>u then married Kunti in a
Svayamvara, a marriage in which the girl chooses her husband from among
a number of suitors, assembled together. And the all auspicious daughter
of the king of Madra became also the second wife of Pân<u>d</u>u. Once,
on an occasion, the powerful Pân<u>d</u>u, while hunting in the forest
killed a Muni, in the form of a deer, engaged in the act of
co-habitation, thinking it to be a deer. The dying Muni became inflated
with wrath, cursed Pân<u>d</u>u :-- “If you co-habit, certainly you will
die.” Thus cursed by the Muni, Pân<u>d</u>u became very sorrowful and
abandoned his kingdom and began to live in the forest. O Munis! His two
wives Kuntî and Mâdrî, followed their husband as chaste women do, to
serve him in the forest. Dwelling in the hermitage of the Munis,
Pân<u>d</u>u listened to the Dharma S’âstras and practised severe
penance. Once while he was listening to the religious discourses of the
Munis, he heard unmistakeably the Munis telling that the man who is
sonless can never go to the Heavens; so he must get a son somehow or
other. The Pundits declare that the sons born of the father's semen, the
sons born of their daughters, the K<u>s</u>ettraja, the Goloka, the
Kun<u>d</u>a, the Sahoda, the Kânîna, the Krîta, one obtained in the
forest, or one offered by another father, unable to

 

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

 

nourish his son, all are entitled to inherit the wealth of the father;
but the sons, enumerated successively are more and more inferior.

 

N.B.: Ksettraja - of a son, the off spring of the wife by a kinsman
appointed to procreate issue to the husband.

         Goloka - Bastard child of a widow.

         Kunda - a child born in adultery.

         Sahoda - the son of a woman pregnant at the time of marriage.

         Kânîna - the son born of a young and unmarried woman.

         Krîta - purchased

 

49-52. Hearing this, Pân<u>d</u>u spoke to the lotus-eyed Kunti to
procreate sons for him soon by a great ascetic Muni :-- “By my order,
you will not incur any sin in doing this. I heard that in ancient times
the high souled kin Saudâsa got son from Vas'i<u>st</u>ha.” Kunti, then
spoke to the king :-- “O Lord! I know one Siddha mantra; it was given to
me before by the Muni Durvâsâ. Whichever Devatâ I will invoke by that
Mantra, he will instantly come to my side, controlled by that Mantra.”

 

53-71. At the request of the husband, Kuntî invoked Dharma, the best of
the Devas; and after being impregnated by him, gave birth to
Yudhis<u>t</u>hira. Then she got through Pavana Deva, the son Vrikodara;
and through Indra the Lord of the Devas, Arju<u>n</u>a. Thus, in every
year, Kunti gave birth to one son and so in three years she gave birth
to three very powerful and mighty sons. At this Màdri spoke to her
husband :-- “O king, the best of the Kurus! What shall I do now? Kindly
suggest to me the means of procreating sons; O Lord, remove my pain.”
Pân<u>d</u>u asked Kunti for this; Kunti, moved with pity, gave her the
mantra, so that she might get one son. Then the beautiful Mâdrî, invoked
the twin As'vin under the advice of her husband and got a pair of twins
Nakula and Sahadeva through them. O Munis! Thus five Pâ<u>nd</u>avas
were born successively in every following year to the wives of
Pân<u>d</u>u by the seed of the Devas. Once on a time Pân<u>d</u>u,
whose end was drawing nigh became very passionate at the sight of Mâdrî
in that solitary hermitage. He, though forbidden repeatedly by Mâdri,
warmly embraced her, as if dictated by the great destroyer, and fell to
the ground. As the creeper falls down when the tree is felled, so Mâdrî
dropped on the ground and began to cry violently. Having heard the
wailings of Mâdrî, Kunti and the five sons of Pân<u>d</u>u came there
weeping and crying; a tumult then ensued and the great Munis also
appeared on the scene. Then those Munis, practising great vows, knew
that Pàn<u>d</u>u was dead and performed duly, on the banks of the
Ganges, the ceremony of burning the dead.

 

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

 

At that time Mâdri gave over to Kunti the charge of her two sons and
followed the Satî practice along with her husband to go to Satyaloka.

 

The Munis, then, performed Tarpa<u>n</u>a ceremonies in honour of
Pân<u>d</u>u and Mâdri and took Kunti and the five sons to Hastinâpur.
Knowing that Kunti has come, Bhîsma, Vidura and the relatives of
Dhritarâstra within the city, all came to Kunti. They all asked Kunti
:-- “O beautiful one! Whose are these five sons?” Kunti, then,
remembered the curse on Pân<u>d</u>u and sorrowfully expressed :-- “
These are the Deva's sons born in Kuru family.” In order to convince the
people assembled there, Kunti invoked the Devas who came in the
celestial space above and said :-- “Yes, these are the sons born of our
seeds.” Bhîsma, then, paid respect to the words of the Devas and
honoured duly the boys. Bhîsma then took the five sons and
Pân<u>d</u>u's wife to Hastinâ and gladly nourished them. O Munis! The
sons of Prithâ were thus born and nourished by Bhîsma.

 

Thus ends the sixth chapter of the second Adhyâya on the birth of the
Pâ<u>nd</u>avas in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam.
