1-6. Vyâsa said :-- O King! The two powerful Dânavas Vâskala and
Durmukha, well-versed in arts of warfare, went out for battle, maddened
with their prowess. The two Dânavas, elated with vanity, went to the
battle-field and began to address the Devî in voice deep as the rumbling
of a cloud. O Beautiful Devî! You better choose and worship the Lord of
the Daityas, that high-souled Mahi<u>s</u>âsura who has conquered all
the Devas. He will come before you in privacy in a human shape, with all
auspicious signs and adorned with beautiful ornaments. O Sweet smiling
One! better place your highest feelings of love on the lovely
Mahi<u>s</u>a as your husband, and you will get all the pleasures of the
three worlds as you desire. O Sweet speaking! In short, if you select
him as your husband, you will be the mistress of those incomparable
worldly happinesses that women always aspire.

 

7-13. Hearing thus the words of Vâskala and Durmukha, the Devî said :--
“O Stupid! Do you think Me as deluded by passion? Do I not possess
strength and intelligence that I will worship that hypocrite
Mahi<u>s</u>a

as husband? See! The ladies of a high family select those persons that
are equal in rank as far as family and distinctions, qualifications and
propriety of conduct are concerned or those who are superior in beauty,
cleverness, intelligence and other qualifications. Then how can a Devî,
becoming passionate, worship the worst of all beasts, the beast
Mahi<u>s</u>a? O two Asuras! Go you immediately to your King
Mahi<u>s</u>a resembling in his body like an elephant and having a pair
of horns and tell him, Go either to Pâtâla (the nether regions) or come
and fight with Me; the Lord of the Devas will no doubt be happy if the
war ensues.  O Stupid! My advent here cannot go in vain; I will easily
slay you and then depart; knowing this do as you like. O Beast! Without
conquering Me, you would get no shelter either in the heavens, or in
this earth, or in the caves of mountains?”

 

14-25. Vyâsa said :-- Hearing thus, the two powerful Daityas, with eyes
reddened with anger, firmly resolved to fight and took bows and arrows
in their hands. O Descent of Kuru! The Devî then made a terrible noise
and fearlessly stood there. The two Dânavas then began to shoot dreadful
arrows at Her. For the victory of the Devas, the Devî also begin to hurl
arrows after arrows on the two Dânavas, emitting a sweet sound. Vâskala
first came forward with no delay; and Durmukha stood aloof there simply
as a witness. The terrible fight then ensued between the Devî and
Vâskala; arrows, swords and weapons were seen shining in the air and
raised terror to those that were dull in intellect. Then the Mother of
the Universe seeing Vâskala growing turbulent shot at him five arrows
sharpened on stone. The Dânava, too, cut off the arrows of the Devî and
hurled seven arrows at Her, seated on a lion. The Devî cut off the
Dânava’s arrows and shot at that hypocrite, sharpened arrows and began
to laugh frequently. She again cut off his arrows with Ardhachandra
arrow; Vâskala then pursued the Devî with a club in his hands to slay
Her. Seeing the arrogant Dânava with club in his hands, Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ
Devî struck him down on the ground with Her own club. The very powerful
Vâskala fell down on the ground but rose up within a very short time and
hurled again on the Devî his club. Seeing him again attacking Her, the
Devî got angry and pierced him with Her trident; Vâskala fell down, thus
pierced, and died.

 

26-38. Vâskala falling thus dead on the field, the soldiers of the
wicked demon routed; whereas the Devas became glad and repeatedly
shouted aloud, “Victory to the Devî.” On this Daitya being slain,
Durmukha came forward on the battle-field, filled with anger and
accompanied by a stronger army. Mounted on a chariot, shielded all over
his

body with a coat of armour, Durmukha came before the Devî, shouting all
along, “Wait, wait, O You weak woman!” and with bows and arrows in his
hands. The Devî blew Her conchshell and made sounds by stretching Her
bow in order to make the Dânava infuriated with anger. The Asura then
began to shoot sharp arrows after arrows like poisonous snakes. The
Mahâmâyâ, by Her own arrows, cut off those of Her enemy and began to
shout loudly. The fight then raged furiously, when both parties began to
use arrows, S’aktis, clubs, Mu<u>s</u>alas, and Tomaras. Blood began to
flow in the battle-field in torrents like rivers and on the banks of
that river of blood, were seen the severed heads of the dead bodies
which looked like so many hollow shells of  gourds, as if kept there by
the attendant of the god of Death, for their swimming purposes. The
battle-field, then, became very dreadful and impassable; at some places
dead bodies are lying; wolves are feeding on their flesh; at other
places are seen jackals, dogs, herons, crows, vultures, eagles, and
other voracious birds and beasts and iron-tipped arrows, eating the dead
bodies of those wicked demons. Air began to emit an offensive smell,
because of its contact with these corpses; and there were heard the
heart-rending sounds of various carnivorous birds and animals. Then the
wicked Durmukha began, as if inspired by the god of Death, to address
the Devî angrily and arrogantly with his right hand raised up before
Her. “Your brain has become perverted; fly away just now or I will send
you unto death, or you better accept the proud Mahi<u>s</u>a, the lord
of the Daityas, as your husband.”

 

39-50. The Devî said :-- “O Villain! I see your death at hand this very
day; therefore you are deluded and therefore raving like a mad man. I
will kill you today like Vâskala. O Stupid! Better fly away; or if you
prefer death, then wait; I will slay you first; then the dull
Mahi<u>s</u>a, the son of a she-buffalo.” Hearing thus, Durmukha, as if
prompted by Death, hurled dreadful arrows on the Devî. Instantly the
Devî, too, cut off all his arrows and, infuriated with anger, pierced
the Dânava by sharpened arrows as Indra had pierced Vritrâsura before.
The fight then turned out very dreadful. O King! Weak persons become
very afraid and strong ones become very excited. Instantly the Devî cut
off the Asura’s bow and broke his chariot by five arrows. On seeing his
chariot broken, the powerful Durmukha attacked on foot the Devî with his
club, very hard to overcome. He knocked at the head of the lion with
that club with great force; but the powerful lion did not become
unsteady, though so very hard hit. Seeing the demon thus standing before
Her, the goddess Ambikâ cut down his head by her sharpened axe. On his
head being thus severed, Durmukha fell down dead on the field. The band
of Immortals, then, loudly shouted, “Victory to the Devî.” When Durmukha
was slain, the

Immortals from the celestial space began to chant praises and hymns to
the Devî, showered down flowers on Her head and gave shouts of “Victory
to the Devî.” The Ri<u>s</u>is, Siddhas, Gandarbhas, Vidyâdharas, and
Kinnaras all became very glad to see the Demon dead on the field.

 

Here ends the Thirteenth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the killing of
Vâskala and Durmukha in S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam, the
Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am, of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
