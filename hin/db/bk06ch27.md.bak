1-13. Nârada said :-- On hearing these words of her daughter from her
nurse, the King addressed the queen Kaikeyî, of lovely eyes, standing
close by, thus :-- “Have you heard what the nurse has said? Damayantî
has mentally chosen the monkey-faced Nârada as her husband. What has she
thought? Whatever it be, it is no doubt, an act of great foolishness.
His face is monkey-like; how can I betroth my daughter to him? Where is
an ugly beggar Nârada? And where is my daughter Damayantî? The marriage
between them is quite unjust; never it should take place. O Beautiful
One of good hairs! Better call her before you in private and show her
reasons approved of the S’âstras and of the aged persons and make her
desist from such a rash course.” On hearing her husband’s words, the
mother of Damayantî called her in private and said :-- “O Child! Where
is your this beautiful face? And where is the monkey-like face of
Nârada? You are smart and quick; how have you been, then, deluded by
such a Moha? O Child! You are the daughter of a king! Your body is
gentle like a creeper. And Nârada always besmears his body with ashes;
so his body is very rough. O Spotless One! How will you change your
words with him? Why do you shew your attachment to an ugly person? What
pleasure do you feel thereby? You would be married to a beautiful
prince; never follow this rash course; your father is very sorry to hear
these from your nurse. O One of soft body! Judge this yourself, what
intelligent man is there that is not sorry at the soft Mâlatî creeper
entwining a thorny tree? Even a stupid silly man would never

feed a camel, that likes thorns, with soft betel-leaves. When your
marriage time arrives, say yourself, who will not be sorry to see you
going to Nârada and embracing him by his arms! Nobody likes to speak
with an ugly faced one; how will you be able to spend your time with him
till your death!”

 

14-29. Nârada said :-- On hearing the mother’s words, the gentle
Damayantî, with her mind intently fixed on me, spoke to her mother, very
much depressed in her spirits. “O Mother! What good face and beautiful
form will avail, who is not in the path of love and who is quite
ignorant of amorous feelings and sentiments! And what will the wealth
and kingdoms of that unskilled illiterate person avail! The deer, that
roam in the forest, getting enchanted by the Nâda (sound) Rasa, give up
their lives even to the singers. So they are fortunate. But fie to the
persons who are illiterate and void of feelings of love! O Mother!
Nârada Ri<u>s</u>i is well conversant with the science of music with
seven Svaras. No other man save Mahâ Deva knows this. Living with an
illiterate person is courting death at every moment. One devoid of
qualifications should be always avoided, by all means, though he be
wealthy and of a beautiful form. Fie on the friendship with kings that
are illiterate and puffed up with vain arrogance! A well-qualified man,
be he even a beggar, is far better to be cultivated friendship with.
Leaving other circumstances out of account, even to change words with
such a well qualified man, makes one highly delighted. The man is very
rare in this world, though he be weak, if he be well versed in the
science of music and if he knows Svara, Grâma, Murchchanâ and be skilled
in eight sentiments of love. \[Note :-- Svara - <u>S</u>a<u>d</u>aja,
Ri<u>s</u>abha, Gâ<u>n</u>dhâra, Madhyama, Panchama, Dhaivata and
Ni<u>s</u>âda. Grâma - the gradual increase and decrease in Svaras.
Murchchana - the rising of sounds, an intonation; a duly regulated rise
and fall of sound conducting the air and the harmony through the keys in
a pleasing manner; changing the key or passing from one key to another;
modulation; melody\]. The man versed in the knowledge of Svara leads one
to the Heaven of Kailâs’a as the rivers Ganges and Sarasvatî by their
own merits lead one to Kailâs’a. There is not the least doubt in this.
He is a Deva in his human body who knows the Svara measure; and he who
does not know the Svara and its seven grades is a beast though he has a
human form - he who finds no delight when he hears the tune regulated by
Murchchanâ and the seven Svaras. Do not consider the deer as beasts for
they get enchanted when they hear the musical notes. The venomous
snakes, though they have no ears, get delighted to hear the enchanting
Svara Nâda by their eyes. They even are to be praised;

but fie on those human beings who have ears but who do not find any
delight when they hear the Nâda! The little children feel intense
pleasure to hear the music, but fie, fie on those elders who are void of
this musical sentiments! Does not my father know that Nârada is
ornamented with many qualifications? Who is there in the three worlds
like him in singing the Sâma songs! For this very reason, indeed! I have
already selected him as my husband; afterwards, due to a curse, the
Muni, the ocean of qualifications, got his face changed into that of a
monkey. The Kinnaras, skilled in the science of music, have their faces
horse-like; but are they not dear to all? What business have they to get
good faces? They enchant the Devas even by their sweet ravishing songs.
O Mother! Kindly tell my father that I have already chosen Nârada as my
husband. Therefore let him deliver me to his hands, without making any
further requests in this matter.”

 

30-40. Nârada said :-- On hearing the words of her daughter Damayantî,
that unblameable pure queen knowing her attachment deep towards me,
spoke to the King thus :-- “O King! Now celebrate in an auspicious day
and on an auspicious moment the auspicious marriage of Damayantî; the
daughter has said that she has already selected Nârada as her bridegroom
and it cannot be other-wise.” Thus prompted by the queen, the King
S’anjaya performed the marriage ceremony of her daughter in accordance
with due rites and customs and in an exceedingly becoming manner. O
Ri<u>s</u>i! Thus I entered into the married life and remained there
though my heart constantly burned with the thought of my monkey-face.
Whenever the princess used to come to me for my service, I used to get
tormented with the remembrance of my monkey-face; but her face beamed
with gladness whenever she saw me; never she became sorry nor dejected,
even for a moment, to see my face monkey-like. Thus time passed on. One
day the Muni Parvata suddenly came there, after making his sojourn to
many places of pilgrimages. I showed him a great respect and gladly
loved him and greeted him duly; he got himself seated in an excellent
Âsana and became very sorry to see me. I am his uncle and have entered
into a married life; my face has become monkey-like. Therefore I am very
much depressed in spirits and worried with the sad thought and has
become lean and thin. Seeing this he was overwhelmed with pity. He then
said :-- “O Muni! The curse that I cast on you before out of my anger, I
now withdraw. Hear. O Mahar<u>s</u>i! Let your face be by my merits,
again as good as it was before; I now feel pity for the daughter of the
King.”

 

41-52. Hearing thus, my heart also became gentle and instantly with a
view to free him of my curse, I said :-- “Let your journey to

 

<span id="page_581">p. 581</span>

 

the Heavens be re-established. I now make this special favour on you as
regards my curse on you before.” O Dvaipâyana! At his word, before our
sight, my face became exceedingly handsome as it was before. The
princess Damayantî became very glad and instantly she went to the mother
and said :-- “O Mother! At the word of Parvata, the great Muni, the
curse of your son-in-law has been removed and his face has become
handsome as before and the lustre of his body has also increased.” The
queen was very much filled with ecstasy and joy at Damayantî’s words and
went hurriedly and informed the King. The King S’anjaya gladly went at
once to see the Muni. The great King became very glad and gave lots of
wealth, gems and jewels to me and my nephew Parvata as a dowry. O
Dvaipâyana! Thus I have described to you my old story how I felt the
strong influence of Mâyâ. O Fortunate One! Owing to the illusory nature
of the Gu<u>n</u>as, like a magic, no embodied being in this world could
have been happy before, or he is happy now or he will be happy
hereafter. Lust, anger, greed, jealousy, attachment, egoism, and vanity,
each one of these is very powerful; nobody is able to conquer these. O
Muni! The three Gu<u>n</u>as Sâttva, Râjas and Tâmas are the entire
causes of the coming into this bodily existence of every being. O
Dvaipâyana! Once I was passing with Bhagavân Vi<u>sn</u>u, laughing and
joking, making merriments through a forest, when suddenly I was
transformed into a woman. Next I became the wife of a king enchanted by
Mâyâ, I remained in his house and gave birth to many children.

 

53-56. Vyâsa said :-- O Devar<u>s</u>i! A great doubt has now arisen in
my mind at your word. O Muni! You are very wise; how then did you get
womanhood; how again did you regain your manhood? Who was the king at
whose house you stayed and how did you give birth to children; describe
fully and satisfy my curiosity. Describe to me, now, the nature of Mâyâ,
extremely wonderful, by which this entire universe, moving and
non-moving, all are enchanted. O Muni! Though I have heard your
nectar-like words, capable to remove all the doubts, embodying the
essence of all the S’âstras, yet I am not fully satiated.

 

Here ends the Twenty-seventh Chapter of the Sixth Book on the marriage
of Nârada and his face getting transformed into that of a monkey in S’rî
Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
