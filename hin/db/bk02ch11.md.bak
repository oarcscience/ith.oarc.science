1-4. Sûta said :-- “O Munis! seeing now the king lifeless, and his son a
mere boy, the ministers themselves performed all his funeral ceremonies.
First they burned the king on the banks of the Ganges without uttering
any Mantra, as his death was an accidental one due to snake bite,
afterwards they had an effigy of the king made of kus’a grass and placed
it on a funeral pyre and burned it, with sandal and scented wood. The
priest then performed and completed his funeral obsequies, repeating
duly the Vedic mantras, and distributed various things in charities to
the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s, together with sufficient quantity of gold, and
varieties of food and clothings so that the king may attain heaven.

 

5-7. Next, on an auspicious moment, the ministers installed the boy
prince on the throne that gladdened the hearts of the subjects and all
the popu-

lace of the city, towns, and villages acknowledged the boy prince
Janamejaya, endowed with all royal qualities as their king. The Dhâtreyi
gave all instructions to the king about his duties. The boy prince
gradually grew in years and became endowed with great intellect.

 

8-15. When Janamejaya became eleven years old, the family priest
initiated him duly with the Gâyatrî mantra and he also studied it duly.
Then Kripâ chârya taught him perfectly the science of archery
(Dhanurveda) as Dronâchârya taught Arju<u>n</u>a and Paras'urâma taught
Kar<u>n</u>a. Janamejaya learnt by and by all the sciences and became
very powerful and indomitable to his enemies as he was skilled in the
science of archery, he was similarly in the other branches of the Vedas.
Truthful, self-controlled, religious, the king Janamejaya acquired full
knowledge in the Dhârmas'âstras (philosophies and law books) and
Arthas'âstras (economics) and governed his kingdom like the Dharma's son
Yudhi<u>st</u>hira.

 

The king of Kâs'î gave his all-auspicious daughter Vapu<u>st</u>amâ in
marriage to the king Janamejaya wearing golden coat of armour. The king
Janamejaya, with the beautiful Vapus'amâ casting side-long looks, looked
very happy as was the king Vichîtravîrya, when he got for his wife the
daughter of Kâshirâj and also when Arjuna got his Subhadrâ. Then the
king began to enjoy his lotus-eyed Vapustamâ in forest, and gardens like
S’atakratu and S’achî. The able ministers conducted satisfactorily the
reins of government; and the subjects, well governed passed away their
time with cheerful hearts.

 

16-32. In the meanwhile, a Muni, named Uttanka, being much troubled by
Tak<u>s</u>aka, thought who could help him in his taking revenge on
Tak<u>s</u>ak and, seeing the king Parîksit's son the king Janamejaya a
proper person came to Hastinâ to the king and spoke out thus :-- “O good
king! Thou dost not know when to do a thing that ought to be done; Thou
art doing at present what ought not to be done; and thou art not doing
what should be done now. There is nothing of anger or energy within
Thee; Thou dost things as a child does; so Thou dost not know the
meaning of the S’âstras nor dost Thou know Thy former enemy; so what
shall I pray before Thee?”  Hearing this Janamejaya said :-- “O highly
fortunate one! I do not know who is my enemy; what wrong is there to be
redressed? please speak out what I am to do.” Uttanka said :-- “O king!
the wicked Tak<u>s</u>ak killed Thy father; ask about the death of Thy
father from Thy councillors.” Hearing these words, the king Janamejaya
asked his ministers; they replied “Thy father died out of the snake
Tak<u>s</u>aka's bite.” Then the king spoke :-- “The cause of my
father's death is the Brâhmi<u>n</u>'s curse; what is the fault of
Tak<u>s</u>aka in this matter; please say.” Uttanka said :-- It was
Tak<u>s</u>aka that

 

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

 

gave abundance of wealth to Kâs'yapa who was coming to cure Thy father
of Tak<u>s</u>aka's poison and made him desist from his purpose; so O
king! Is not that Tak<u>s</u>aka, then, Thy father's great enemy and his
slayer?

 

O King! In former days, when Pramadvarâ, the dearest wife of the Muni
Ruru, died of snake bite in her unmarried state, Ruru made her alive
again. But Ruru made then the promise “whichever serpent will see, I
will take away its life by striking it with a club.” O King! Thus making
the resolve, he began to kill snakes wherever he found with his club,
and thus, in his course of travel all round the earth, he saw within a
forest an aged terrible water-snake (Dho<u>nd</u>a serpent) and
immediately lifted his club to kill it and angrily struck a blow on it,
when the snake replied :-- “O Brâhma<u>n</u>a! Why are you striking me
thus? I have not caused any offence to you.” Ruru said :-- “O serpent!
My dearest wife died of snake bite; since then I have made this resolve,
under great provocation and sorrow, to kill snakes.” Hearing thus, the
water-snake Du<u>nd</u>ubha replied :-- “I do not bite; those who bite
are a different class of snakes; simply on account of my bearing a body
similar to them that you will strike me is not quite proper.” Hearing
these beautiful humane words from the mouth of a serpent, Ruru asked :--
“Who are you? Why have you become this Du<u>nd</u>ubha snake?”

 

33-45. The snake replied :-- “O Brâhma<u>n</u>a! I was formerly a
Brâhma<u>n</u>; there was a friend of mine named Khyâs, very religious,
truthful and self-controlled. Once he was staying in his Agnihotra room
and I foolishly terrified him much by placing before him an artificial
snake created by me of the leaves of trees. He became so much bewildered
with fear and shuddered so terribly that he at length cursed me saying
:-- “O one of blunt intellect! As you have terrified me by this snake,
having no poison, so you better be a snake of that type.” Immediately I
turned into a snake and when I much entreated that Brâhma<u>n</u>a, his
anger abated a little and he said again :-- “O snake! Pramati's son Ruru
will no doubt free you of this curse.” I am that snake; and you are also
that Ruru; now hear my words in conformity with Dharma. The highest
Dharma of the Brâhma<u>n</u>a, is non-killing. There is no doubt in
this. The wise Brâhma<u>n</u>as ought to show mercy to all. No harm or
killing is to he committed anywhere except in Yajña (sacrifice); killing
is only allowed in a Yajña; for at the sacrifice, the animal killed
attains the highest goal; hence killing in sacrifice is not reckoned as
an act of killing. Uttanka said :-- That Brâhma<u>n</u>a was then freed
of the serpent body; and Ruru, too, desisted from killing since then. O
King! Ruru gave life back to that girl and married her but even then,
remembering the former enmity he killed the snakes. But, O chief of
Bharata's family! Thou art staying without

 

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

 

any care, without any anger to the snakes and without any revenge to the
previous wrong. O king of kings! Thy father died high up in the air
without any bath or charity due to be done at the time of death. So
rescue thy father by killing his enemies, the snakes. That son is dead,
though living, who does not consider the act of his father's enemy as
inimical. Until Thou dost kill the snakes, Thy father's enemies, Thy
father's hell life will not be freed. O king! Now remember the wrong
done to Thy father and perform the sacrifice to the Great Mother,
denominated as the Sarpa Yajña (the sacrifice of snakes).

 

46-55. Sûta said :-- Hearing the words of Uttanka, the king Janamejaya
sadly wept and shed tears, and thought within himself :-- “Alas! Fie to
me! I am a great stupid; hence I feel myself proud but in vain. Where
can his honour be whose father, bitten by a snake, has gone down to
hell. Now I will, no doubt, commence the Sarpa Yajña and ensure the
destruction of all the snakes in the blazing sacrificial fire and thus
deliver my father from hell.” Thus coming to a conclusion, he called all
his ministers and said :-- “O ministers! Better make arrangements duly
for a great sacrifice. Have a suitable holy site on the banks of the
Ganges, selected and measured by the Brâhma<u>n</u>as and have a
beautiful sacrificial hall built up on one hundred pillars and prepare a
sacrificial altar within this. O Ministers! When all these preliminaries
will be completed, I will commence with great eclat the great Sarpa
Yajña (sacrifice of snakes). In that Yajña, the snake Tak<u>s</u>ak will
be the animal victim; and Uttanka, the great Muni, will be the
sacrificial priest; so invite early the all-knowing Brâhma<u>n</u>as,
versed in the Vedas. Thus at the command of the king, the able ministers
collected all the materials of the sacrifice and prepared a big
sacrificial altar. When the oblations were offered on the sacrificial
fire, calling on the snakes, Tak<u>s</u>ak became greatly distressed
with fear and took refuge of Indra saying “Save my life”. Indra, then,
gave hopes to Tak<u>s</u>aka, trembling with fear, and made him sit on
his Âsana, encouraged him with words “No fear”. O! snake do not fear any
more.

 

 56-65. The Muni Uttanka, seeing that Tak<u>s</u>ak had taken Indra's
protection and that Indra had given him hopes of “no fear”, called on
Tak<u>s</u>aka with Indra to come to fire with an anxious heart;
Tak<u>s</u>ak, then, seeing no other way, took refuge of the greatly
religious Âstik, the son of the Muni Jarat Kâru, born of the family of
Yâyâvara. The Muni's son Âstik came to the sacrificial hall and chanted
hymns in praise of Janamejaya; the king, too, seeing the Muni boy
greatly learned worshipped him and said :-- “What for have you come? I
will give you what you desire.” Hearing this, Âstika prayed :-- “O
highly enlightened one! Let you desist from this sacrifice.”

The truthful king, prayed thus again and again, stopped the Sarpa Yajña
to keep the Muni's word. Vais'ampâyana then recited the whole
Mahâbhârata to the king to cheer up his heart. But the king, hearing the
whole Mahâbhârata could not find peace and asked Veda Vyâsa “how can I
get peace; my mind is constantly being burned with sorrow; say what am I
to do? I am very miserable; hence my father Parîksit the son of
Abhimanyu has died an unnatural death. O lucky one! See that a
K<u>s</u>attriya's death in a deadly battlefield or in an ordinary
battle is praiseworthy; even his death in his own house, if followed up
according to natural laws and Vidhis (rules) is commendable; but my
father did not die such a death; under the Brâhma<u>n</u>a's curse why
did he, quite senseless, quit his life high up in the air? O son of
Satyavatî! Now advise me so that my father who is now in hell can again
go up to the heavens, and that my heart may find its way to peace.”

 

Thus ends the Eleventh Chapter of the Second Skandha on the “Sarpa
Yajña” in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>a S’rîmad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000
verses.
