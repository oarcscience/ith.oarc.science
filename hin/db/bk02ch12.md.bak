1-4. Sûta said :-- Hearing these words of the king, Vyâsa Deva, the son
Satyavatî addressed to him before the assembly, thus :-- “O king! I am
now reciting to you a Bhâgavata Purâ<u>n</u>a, holy, wonderful, filled
with many anecdotes, and leading to auspicious results; listen. Before I
made my son S'uka study this Purâ<u>n</u>a; O king! I will now recite
before you that highest Purâ<u>n</u>a, with all the secrets contained
therein. I have extracted this from all the Âgamas; it brings in Dharma
(religion), Artha (wealth), Kâma (fructification of desires) and
Mok<u>s</u>a (liberation); hearing this gives always happiness and good
results.

 

5-6. At this Janamejaya said :-- “O Lord! Whose son is this Muni Âstika?
Why did he come as an obstacle in my Sarpa Yajña (sacrifice of snakes)?
And what object had he in preserving the snakes? O highly fortunate one!
Kindly describe all this in detail; after this recite the Purâ<u>n</u>a,
also, in detail to me.”

 

7-18. Vyâsa Deva said :-- “O king! In former days there lived a Muni
named Jaratkâru. He always remained in the path of peace; and did not
marry. Once he saw, in a cave in a forest, his fathers and forefathers
pendant. They spoke to Jaratkâru thus :-- “O son! Marry; we will thereby
be greatly pleased; if there be a son of good character born to you, we
all will be freed from all troubles and we would then able to go to
Heavens.” Hearing this Jaratkâru said :-- “O Forefathers! If I get a
girl of my name, without begging and asking and if she be entirely
obedient to me, I will marry and lead a householder's life; thus

 

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

 

I have spoken truly to you.” Thus saying to his forefathers, Jaratkâru
went on tour to the holy places. Now it happened so, that at that very
time Kadru, the mother of snakes cursed her sons, saying “May you be
burnt by fire.” The matters of this incident run as follows :-- “At that
moment Kadru and Vinatâ, the two co-wives of Kas'yapa saw the horses
yoked in the chariot of the sun and thus argued with each other :--
Kadru, seeing the sun's horse, first asked Vinatâ “O good one! Tell me
soon, what is the colour of this horse?” Vinatâ said :-- “O auspicious
one! What do you think?” I said, the colour of the horse is white; you
also better say before hand what is its colour? We will then lay a wager
(and challenge). Kadru said :-- “O Smiling one! I think the the horse is
black. Now come; let us challenge; whoever will be defeated will become
the slave of the other.” Thus saying, Kadru told her sons that were
obedient :-- “Cover by your bodies all the pores of the body of the
horse of the chariot of the Sun, so it may look black; go and do it.” At
this some snakes replied “That cannot be.” Kadru then cursed them saying
:-- “Let you fall on the sacrificial fire of Janamejaya.” Then the other
snakes tried to please their mother and coiled round the back of that
horse so that the horse began to look black. Kadru and Vinatâ, the two
co-wives went together and saw the horse. Vinatâ saw it black and became
very sorry.

 

19-21. Now, Garu<u>d</u>a, Vinatâ's son, very powerful and devourer of
snakes was passing that way and seeing his mother very distressed asked
her :-- “O Mother! Why do you look so very sorry? It seems as if you are
weeping. Aru<u>n</u>a, the charioteer of the Sun and I myself are your
two sons living. Fie to us that, while we are living, you will have to
suffer pains. O beautiful one! If mother suffers while the son is
living, then what use is there in having such a son? So, O Mother, give
out the cause of your grief and I will remove it at once.”

 

22-31. Hearing this Vinatâ said :-- “O son! What shall I say to you of
my misery; I am now become the slave of my rival wife. By some pretext
she defeated me and is now telling me to carry her on my back. O son!
For this reason I am sorry.” Hearing these words of the mother, Garuda
said :-- “Very well I will carry her on my shoulders wherever she wishes
to go. O auspicious one! You need not be sorry; I will remove all your
cares.” Vyâsa Deva said :-- Thus spoken to by Garu<u>d</u>a, Vinatâ went
to Kadru. At that time the highly powerful Garu<u>d</u>a went there also
to free his mother of her slavery and carried Kadru with all her sons on
his back to the other side of the ocean. When Garu<u>d</u>a went across
the ocean, Garu<u>d</u>a spoke to Kadru :-- “O mother! I bow down to
thee; kindly say how my mother can be freed

 

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

 

of your slavery. Hearing this Kadru said :-- “O son! If you can bring
to-day by your sheer force nectar from the Deva loka and give it to my
sons then you will be able to free your helpless mother. When Kadru said
so, the highly powerful Vinatâ's son, Garu<u>d</u>a immediately went to
the abode of Indra and, fighting hard, stole away the jar of nectar and
brought and gave it to Kadru and freed his mother Vinatâ from the
slavery of Kadru. In the meantime, the snakes went for their bath, after
which they would drink the nectar. Indra stole away that jar which
contained nectar. O king! Thus, by the sheer strength of arms of
Garu<u>d</u>a Vinatâ was freed of her slavery. On the other hand, when
the snakes returned from their bath and found that there was no jar of
nectar, they began to lick the Ku<u>s</u>a grass over which the jar of
nectar was kept, thinking that they would thereby get some drops of
nectar which might have trickled over; and the result was that by the
sharp edges of ku<u>s</u>a grasses, the tongues of all the snakes were
cut asunder into two; hence the snakes are called Dvijihva.

 

32-36. The snake Vâsuki and others, whom Kadru, the mother of snakes,
cursed, went to Brahmâ and took his refuge and informed all of the cause
of their terror, the curse from their mother; when Brahmâ spoke to them
:-- “Go and give the sister of Vâsuki, named Jaratkâru, in marriage to
the great Muni Jarat Kâru, (both of the same name). In her womb, a son
named Âstika will be born; and he will certainly deliver you from your
difficulties. Hearing those beneficial words of Brahmâ, Vâsuki went to
the forest and requested humbly the great Muni Jarat Kâru to accept in
marriage her own sister when the Muni, knowing the girl to be of his
name, spoke out thus :-- “But when your sister will act against my
wishes, I will forsake her at once.”

 

37-46. Under these conditions, the Muni married her. And Vâsuki, after
giving her sister in marriage according to her own wishes to the Muni,
returned to her own abode. O Tormentor of foes! Then the Muni Jaratkâru
built a white hut of leaves in that great forest and began to pass his
days happily in enjoyment with his wife. Once, on an occasion, after he
had taken his dinner he slept and told his wife not to awaken him under
any circumstances and fell fast asleep. The beautiful sister of Vâsuki
sat by his side. When the evening time came and the sun began to set,
the Vâsuki's sister Jaratkâru became afraid at the thought that the
evening Sandhya might not be performed by the Muni and thought thus :--
“What am I to do now? My heart finds not rest if I do not awaken him;
and if I awaken him, he will forsake me at once. Now if I do not awaken
him, the evening will pass away to no purpose. Whatever it be, if he
quits me or if my death ensues, that is better than the non-observance
of Dharma; for when Dharma is destroyed, hell ensues.

 

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

 

Thus thinking, the girl awakened him saying :-- “O One of good vows! It
is evening time; so get up; etc.” The Muni got up in great anger and
addressed his wife :-- “When you have disturbed my sleep, I now go away
from you; you also better go to your brother's house.” When the Muni
said so, Vâsuki's sister spoke out, trembling :-- “O One of indomitable
lustre! How will the object be served for which my brother has given me
in marriage with you.”

 

47-50. The Muni then spoke firmly to his wife Jaratkâru :-- “That is
within your womb.” Jaratkâru then, forsaken by the Muni, went to the
abode of Vâsuki. When her brother Vâsuki asked her about her son, she
said :-- “The Muni has forsaken me, saying that the son is within your
womb.” At this Vâsuki trusted; and said :-- “The Muni won't ever tell
lies” and gave shelter to his sister. O Kurusattama! After some time, a
famous boy named the Muni Âstika was born.

 

51-56. O king! That Muni boy, the knower of truth, had desisted you from
your sacrifice of snakes for the preservation of his mother's family. It
is well and good, befitting you, that you respected the words of the
Muni Âstika, born of Yâyâvara family and the cousin of Vâsuki. O
Mighty-armed! Let all auspiciousness come to you; you have heard the
whole Mahâbhârata and gave away lots of things in charities. You have
worshipped innumerable Munis. But, O king! Though you have done so many
good things, yet your father has not attained heaven and you have not
been able to sanctify your family. So, O king Janamejaya! Now install a
capacious temple of the Devî with the highest devotion; then all your
desires will be fulfilled. The all auspicious Devî, the Giver of all
desires, makes the kingdoms more stable and increases the family, if She
be always worshipped with the highest devotion.

 

57-64. O king! You better perform duly the Devîmakha Yajña
Yoti<u>st</u>oma and others, pleasing to the Devî, and hear the great
Purâ<u>n</u>a S’rîmad Devî Bhâgavatam, filled with accounts of the
glorious deeds of the Devî. I will make you hear now that Divine
Purâ<u>n</u>a, filled with various sentiments, highly sanctifying and
capable to carry one across this ocean of world. O king! There is no
other subject in this world worthy to be heard than the above
Purâ<u>n</u>a and there is no other thing to be worshipped then the
lotus feet of the Devî. O king! Those are certainly fortunate, those are
intelligent and blessed, in whose hearts of love and devotion reign
always the Devî Bhagavatî. O illustrious scion of Bharata's family! Know
them to the always afflicted with troubles who do not worship in this
world the great Mother Mahâmâyâ. O king! Who is there that will not
worship Her when Brahmâ and all the Devas

 

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

 

are always engaged in Her devotional service. O king! He who hears
always this Purâ<u>n</u>a gets all his desires fulfilled; in former days
Bhagavatî Herself spoke this excellent Purâ<u>n</u>a to Vi<u>sn</u>u. O
king! Your heart will be appeased and become peaceful when you hear
this; and, as a result of your hearing this Purâ<u>n</u>am, all your
ancestors will attain endless Heavenly life.

 

Thus ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Second Skandha on the birth of
Âstika in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S'rîmad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000
verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa. Here ends as well the Second Book.
