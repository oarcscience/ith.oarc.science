**On the anecdote of Sâvar<u>n</u>i Manu**

 

<span id="page_1040">p. 1040</span>

 

1-6. The Muni said :-- O King! The powerful Asura Mahi<u>s</u>a, born of
a she-buffalo, defeated all the Devas and became the Lord of the whole
universe. That indomitable Dânava seized forcibly all

 

<span id="page_1041">p. 1041</span>

 

the rights of the Devas and began to enjoy the pleasures of the kingdom
over the three worlds. The Devas, thus defeated, were expelled from
their abodes in Heavens. They took Brahmâ as their Leader and went to
the excellent regions where Mahâ Deva and Vi<u>sn</u>u resided and
informed them of all that had been done by that vicious Asura
Mahi<u>s</u>a. They said :-- “O Deva of the Devas! The insolent
Mahi<u>s</u>âsura has become unbearable and he has taken possessions of
the rights and properties of the whole host of the Devas and he is now
enjoying them. Both of you are quite capable to destroy the Asura. So
why do you not devise means to annihilate him in no time!”

 

7-10. Hearing these pitiful words of the Devas, Bhagavân Vi<u>sn</u>u
became quite indignant. S’ankara, Brahmâ and the other Devas all were
inflamed with anger. O King! From the face of the angry Hari, then
emanated an Unusual Fire, brilliant like thousand Suns. Then by and by
emanated fires also from the bodies of all the Devas who were filled
then with joy. From the mass of fire thus emanated there came out a
beautiful Female Figure. The face of this figure was formed out of the
fire that emanated from the body of Mahâ Deva. Her hairs were formed out
of the fire of Yama and Her arms were formed out of the fire that
emanated from Vi<u>sn</u>u.

 

11-21. O King! From the fire of the Moon came out two breasts; from the
fire of Indra came out Her middle portion; from the fire of
Varu<u>n</u>a, appeared Her loins and thighs; from the fire of Earth,
Her hips were formed; from the fire of Brahmâ, Her feet were formed;
from the fire of the Sun, Her toes were formed; from the fire of the
Vasus, Her fingers were formed; from Kuvera's fire, Her nose came out;
from the excellent tejas of Prajâpati, teeth; from the fire of Agni, Her
three eyes; from the fire of the twilights, Her eye-brows and from the
fire of Vâyu, Her ears appeared.

 

O Lord of men! Thus Bhagavatî Mahi<u>s</u>amardinî was born of the Tejas
(fiery substances) of the Devas. Next S’iva gave Her the S’ûla (weapon
spear); Vi<u>sn</u>u gave Sudars'ana (Chakra); Varu<u>n</u>a gave the
conchshell; Fire gave S'akti (weapon); Vâyu gave Her bows and arrows;
Indra gave Her thunder bolt and the bell of the elephant Airâvata; Yama
gave Her the Destruction Staff (Kâla Da<u>nd</u>a); Brâmâ gave Her the
Rudrâk<u>s</u>a, rosary and Kama<u>nd</u>alu; the Sun gave Her, in every
pore the wonderful rays; the Time (Kâla) gave Her sharp axe and shield;
the oceans gave Her the beautiful necklace and new clothes (two in
number); Vis'vakarmâ gladly gave Her the crown, ear-rings,

 

<span id="page_1042">p. 1042</span>

 

ka<u>t</u>aka, Angada, Chandrârdha, tinklets; and the Himâlayâs gave Her
the Lion as Her Vehicle and various gems and jewels.

 

22-30. Kuvera, the Lord of wealth gave Her the cup filled with the
drink; Bhagavân Ananta Deva gave Her a necklace of snakes (Nâghâra).
Thus the World Mother, the Devî, became honoured by all the Devas. The
Devas, very much oppressed by Mahi<u>s</u>âsura, then, chanted various
hymns of praise to the World Mother Mâhes'varî Mahâ Devî.

 

Hearing their Stotras, the Deves'î, worshipped by the Devas, shouted
aloud the War-Cry. O King! Mahi<u>s</u>âsura, startled at that War-Cry,
came to Bhagavatî with all his army corps. Then that great Asura
Mahi<u>s</u>a hurled various weapons in the air and overcast the sky
with them and began to fight with great skill. The several generals
Chik<u>s</u>ura, Durdhara, Durmukha, Vâ<u>s</u>kala, Tâmraka,
Vi<u>d</u>âlâk<u>s</u>a and various other innumerable generals as if
Death incarnate, accompanied Mahi<u>s</u>a, the chief Dânava. A fierce
fight then ensued. Then the Devî Who enchants all the beings, became
red-eyed with anger and began to kill the generals of the against party.
When the generals were killed one by one Mahi<u>s</u>âsura, skilled in
the science of magic, came up quickly to the front of the Devî.

 

31-40. The Lord of the Dânavas, then, by his magic power, began to
assume various forms. Bhagavatî, too, began to destroy his those forms.
Then the Daitya, the crusher of the Devas, assumed the form of a buffalo
and began to fight. The Devî then fastened the animal, the Asura, the
Death of the Devas, tightly and cut off his head by Her axe. The
remainder of his forces, then, fled away in terror and disorder with a
loud cry. The Devas became very glad and began to chant hymns to the
Devî. O King! Thus the Lak<u>s</u>mî Devî appeared to kill
Mahi<u>s</u>âsura. Now I will describe how Sarasvatî appeared. Listen.
Once on a time the two very powerful Daityas S’umbha and Nis'umbha were
born. They attacked the Devas, oppressed them and seized their houses
and rights. The Devas became dispossessed of their kingdoms and went to
the Himâlayâs and offered stotras to the Devî with the greatest devotion
:-- “O Deves’î! O Thou, skilled in removing the difficulties of the
Bhaktas! Victory to Thee! O Thou, the Sinless One! Old age and death
cannot touch Thee. O Thou! Death incarnate to the Dânavas! O Deves’î! O
Thou, of mighty valour and prowess! O Thou, the embodiment of Brahmâ,
Vi<u>sn</u>u and Mahes'a! Unbounded is Thy might; Thou canst be easily
reached by the power of devo-

 

<span id="page_1043">p. 1043</span>

 

tion. O Thou, the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer! O Mâdhavî! O Thou,
the Giver of Bliss! Thou dancest with great joy at the time of the
dissolution of all the things (Pralaya).

 

41-50. O Thou, full of mercy! O Deva Deves’î! Be gracious unto us. O
Thou, the Remover of the sufferings of the refugees! We now come unto
Thy protection. The terror of S’umbha and Nis'umbha is like an endless
ocean unto us. Save, save us from their fast clutches. O Devî! save us O
King! verily.” When the Devas praised thus, the daughter of the
Himâlayâs, Bhagavatî became pleased and asked “What is the matter?” In
the meanwhile, there emitted from the physical sheath of the Devî
another Devî Kaus'ikî who gladly spoke to the Devas :-- “O Suras! I am
pleased with Thy Stotra. Now ask the boon that you desire.” The Devas
then asked for the following boon :-- “O Devî! The two famous Daityas
S’umbha and Nis'umbha have attacked forcibly the three worlds. The
wicked Lord of the Dânavas, S’umbha, has overcome us by the power of his
arm and is now tormenting us without any break. Kindly devise some means
to kill him.” The Devî said :-- “O Devas! Be patient. I will kill these
two Daityas, S’umbha and Nis'umbha and thus remove the thorn on your
way. At an early date I will do good to you.” Thus saying to Indra and
the other Devas the merciful Devî disappeared at once before their eyes.
The Deva with their hearts delighted went to the beautiful Sumeru
Mountain and dwelt there in the caves thereof.

 

Here the servants of S’umbha and Nis'umbha Cha<u>nd</u>a and
Mu<u>nd</u>a, while they were making their circuits, saw the exquisitely
beautiful Devî, the Enchantress of the world, and came back to S’umbha
their King and said :--

 

51-60. “O Destroyer of enemies! O Giver of honour! O Greal King! You are
the Lord of all the Daityas and are fit to enjoy all the gems and
jewels. To-day we have seen an extraordinary beautiful woman jewel. She
is fit to be enjoyed by you. So now you would better bring that
perfectly beautiful woman and enjoy. No such enchanting women can be
seen amongst the Asura women Nâga Kanyâs Gandharbha women, Dânavîs or
men.” Hearing thus the words of the servant, S’umbha, the tormentor of
the foes, sent a Daitya named Sugrîva as a messenger to Her. The
messenger went to the Devî as early as possible and spoke to Her all
that S’umbha had told him. “O Devî! The Asura S’umbha is now the
conqueror of the three worlds and respected by the Devas. O Devî!

 

<span id="page_1044">p. 1044</span>

 

He is now enjoying all that is best, the gems and jewels; O Devî! I am
his messenger sent here to convey to you his message as follows :-- O
Devî! I am the sole enjoyer of all the jewels. O Beautiful-eyed! You are
a gem; so you would worship me. O Fair One! All the gems and jewels that
are in the Deva loka, in the Daitya loka, or amongst the regions of men,
are under my control. So you would lovingly worship me.” The Devî said
:-- “O Messenger! True that you are speaking for your King; but I made a
promise before, how can I act against it? O Messenger! Hear what I
promised.

 

61-70. Whoever in the three worlds will conquer Me by sheer force and
thus crush My vanity, whoever will be as strong as Myself, He can enjoy
Me. So the King of Daityas can prove My promise true and by sheer force
can marry Me. What is there with him that he cannot do? So, Messenger!
Go back to your master and tell him all this so that the powerful
S’umbha may fulfil My promise.” Hearing thus the words of the Great
Devî, the messenger went back to S’umbba and informed him everything
regarding the Devî's sayings. The very powerful Lord of the Daityas,
S’umbha became very angry at the unpleasant words of the messenger and
commanded the Daitya named Dhumrâk<u>s</u>a :-- “O Dhumrâk<u>s</u>a!
Listen to my words with great attention. Go and catch hold of that
wicked woman by her hairs and bring her to me. Go quickly; do not
delay.” Thus commanded, the very powerful and the best of the Daityas,
Dhumrâk<u>s</u>a, went at once to the Devî with sixty thousand Daityas
and cried aloud to Her :--

 

“O Auspicious One! You would better worship quickly our Lord S’umbha,
who is very powerful and mighty; you will then acquire all sorts of
pleasures; else I will hold you by your hairs and take you to the Lord
of the Daityas.”

 

71-80. Thus addressd by Dhumrâk<u>s</u>a Daitya, the enemy of the Devas,
the Devî said :-- “O Powerful One! O Daitya! What you have spoken is
perfectly right, but tell me first what you or your king S’umbha can do
to Me?” When the Devî said thus, the Daitya Dhûmralochana rushed on Her
at once with arms and weapons. With one loud noise, Mâhes'varî burnt him
immediately to ashes. O King! The other forces were partly crushed by
the Lion, the vehicle of the Devî and partly fled away in disorder to
all the quarters; some became senseless out of fear. S’umbba , the Lord
of the Daityas, became very angry to hear this. His face assumed a
terrible form with eyebrows contracted. Then he became impatient with
anger and sent in order Cha<u>nd</u>a, Mu<u>nd</u>a and Raktabîja.

 

<span id="page_1045">p. 1045</span>

 

The three powerful Daityas went to the battle and tried their might to
capture the Devî. The Devî Jagaddhâtrî, of violent prowess, seeing that
these three Daityas were coming to Her, killed them by Her trident and
laid them prostrate on the ground. Hearing their death with all their
army, S’umbha and Nis'umbha came in their own persons arrogantly to the
battlefield. S’umbha and Nis'umbha fought for a time with the Devî a
terrible fight and became tired, when the Devî killed them outright.
When the Bhagavatî, Who is all this world, killed S’umbba and Nis'umbha,
the Devas began to praise Bhagavatî the Supreme Deity of Vâk (Word)
incarnate.

 

81-93. O King! Thus I have spoken to you in due order the manner in
which the beautiful Kâlî, Mahâ Lak<u>s</u>mî and Sarasvatî incarnated
themselves on the earth. That Supreme Deity, the Devî Parames'varî thus
creates, preserves, and destroys the Universe. You better take refuge of
that highly adored Devî, that causes the distinction and the delusion of
this Universe. Then only you will attain success. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said
:-- The king Suratha, hearing these beautiful words of the Muni, took
refuge of the Devî, that yields all desired objects. He built an earthen
image of the Devî and, with concentrated attention, thought wholly of
the Devî and began to worship Her with devotion. When the worship was
over, he offered sacrifices of the blood of his body to the Devî. Then
the World-Mother, the Deity of the Devas, became pleased and appeared
before him and asked him :--  Accept the boon that you desire. When the
Devî said thus, the king asked from the Mahes'varî that excellent
knowledge whereby the ignorance is destroyed and as well the kingdom
free from any dangers or difficulties. The Devî said :-- “O King! By My
boon, you will get your foeless kingdom in this very birth as well as
the Jñânam that removes ignorance. O King! I will tell you also what you
will be in the next birth. Hear. In your next birth, you will be the son
of the Sun and be famous as Sâvar<u>n</u>i Manu. By My boon you will be
the Lord of the Manvantara, become very powerful and you will get good
many sons.” Thus granting him this boon, the Devî disappeared. By the
Grace of the Devî, Suratha became the Lord of the Manvantara. O Sâdhu!
Thus I have described to you the birth and deeds of Sâvar<u>n</u>i. He
who hears or reads this anecdote with devotion, will be a favourite of
the Devî.

 

Here ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the anecdote of
Sâvar<u>n</u>i Manu in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam
of 18,000 verses by Mahâr<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
