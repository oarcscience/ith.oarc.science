1-20. The Ri<u>s</u>is said :-- “O son of Lomahar<u>s</u>a<u>n</u>a, O
Sûta; you have described to us how the eight Vasus, cursed by
Vas'i<u>st</u>ha, took their birth and how Bhîsma was born. O knower of
Dharma! Now describe to us in detail how the greatly religious king
S’antanu married the auspicious Yojanagandhâ, the chaste Satyavatî, the
mother of Vyâsa,

knowing full well that she was a fisherman's daughter? O Suvrata! Remove
our this doubt. Sûta then said :-- The sage king S’antanu always used to
go to forests on hunting expeditions, with his heart addicted to hunting
buffaloes, deer and various other wild animals.

 

Thus, for four years that king went out a hunting, with his son Bhîsma,
deer and other wild animals and got the highest happiness as Mahâdeva
finds in company with Kârtikeya. Once, on an occasion, while he was
shooting arrows at rhinoceros and boar, etc., he went so far as to reach
a forest on the banks of the Yamunâ, the chief of the rivers. There he
began to smell an excellent nice smell that could not be described in
words; he tried to find out the source and wandered here and there, and
on all sides of the forest; and thought that this enchanting smell was
not that of Mandâra flowers, musk, champaka nor that of Mâlatî nor that
of Ketaki flower; the air was blowing saturated with peculiar fragrant
smell that he never experienced before. Thus thinking of that smell, the
king S’antanu, being enchanted with that, followed to its source in that
forest. At last he came to a spot on the banks of the Yamunâ the chief
of the rivers, where a very beautiful girl, calm and quiet and with
feminine gestures and posture amorous, lovely but ill-clad, was sitting;
and he found out that the above beautiful smell was coming out of her
body. The form of the lady was extremely beautiful; the smell was very
wonderful, and captivating the hearts of all; her age then entered to
youth and she was very auspicious. The king was greatly surprised and
was eager to know who the lady was; whence she had come; whether she was
a Deva girl, or a human or a Gandarbha daughter or a Nâga daughter? But,
being unable to come to a definite conclusion and becoming passionate,
he remembered Gangâ and asked that lady sitting on the bank of the
Yumnâ, thus :-- “O dear! Who are you? Whose daughter are you? Why are
you alone in this lovely forest? O beautiful eyed! Are you married? Or
are you as yet unmarried? So answer to all these. O lovely eyed one! 
Seeing your lovely enchanting form I am become extremely passionate. So,
O dear! Describe in detail to me, who are you? and what do you intend to
do?” When the king spoke thus the lotus eyed nice-teethed lady replied
as follows :-- “O king! Know me as a fisherman's daughter and I am
completely under my father's command. O king of kings! For Dharma's sake
I carry ferry across this Yumnâ river. My father has gone to-day to our
house. O Master of wealth! Thus I have spoken truth to you.” Thus saying
the lady desisted; the passionate king then spoke to her :-- “I am the
foremost hero of the Kuru family; so choose me as your husband; then
your this youth will not go in vain.

21-32. O fawn-eyed one! I have no other wife existing; so you will be my
legal wife. O Dear! Passion is giving much pains to me; therefore I am
now become your obedient servant for ever. O Beloved! My former dear
wife has abandoned me and gone away; but I have not married since then.
Now seeing you beautiful, in all respects, I cannot bring my mind under
control.”

 

Hearing these nectar-like beautiful words of the king, the sweet scented
fisherman's daughter, though also turned extremely passionate, held
patience and exclaimed :-- “O king! I also desire that which you have
expressed; I am of opinion to act according to your wishes. But, what am
I to do? I am not dependent. You are to know this. My father alone can
give me in marriage to you. So better ask my father for me. Though I am
a fisherman's daughter, still I am not wanton and wilful. I am always
obedient to my father; if my father wills, you can marry me. And I will
be obedient to you. O king! The god of love is tormenting me, who is
endowed with youth; he does not torment you so much. Still I must regard
my family manners and customs coming down from ancient times. I must
hold my patience.” Sûta said :-- Thus passionately pleased with these
fascinating words of the lady, the king went to the fisherman's house
for the lady. Seeing the king coming, the fisherman was greatly
bewildered and astonished and bowed down with great devotion and said
:-- “O King! I am Thy servant. I am blessed by Thy presence. O great
King! Now be graciously pleased to order me the cause of Thy arrival.”
Hearing the fisherman's words, the King said :-- “O sinless one! This I
tell you truly that if you give me your daughter in marriage I will
certainly make her my legal wife.” The fisherman replied :-- “O king!
What must be given ever, how can I say that is not to be given.
Therefore if Thou askest for my daughter, I will certainly give her to
Thee. But, O great King! Thou wilt have to make her son, the king of Thy
kingdom; no other son of Thine could be king, after Thy absence.”

 

33-40. Hearing these words of the fisherman, the king S’antanu became
very anxious. He remembered Gângeya and could not speak anything. He,
being sick with love anxiously returned home; but he abandoned bathing,
fooding, sleeping, etc. At this, the son Gângeya Bhîsma whose vow was
equal to that of the gods, marking that the king was being troubled with
some thought, went to him and asked why he was anxious :-- “O king! Say
truly what is your anxiety; who is your enemy that is not conquered;
whom do you went to bring under your control? O king! What use is there
of having a son who does

not understand the difficulties of his father, or does not try to remove
these difficulties. A son can be called really the son, who is born to
repay the debts incurred by him in previous births; there is no manner
of discussion in this. See, Raghu's son Dâsarathî Râm abandoned his
kingdom under the orders of his father and repaired to Chitrakûta forest
with his brother Lak<u>s</u>man and wife Sîtâ. The son of king Haris
Chandra, Rohîta, ready to repay the debt of his father and sold by his
father, worked as a servant at a Brâhma<u>n</u>a's house. So the famous
S’unahs'ephah, sold by his high souled father Ajigarta was tied for
sacrifice in a sacrificial post; but he was afterwards freed by the
Gâdhi's son Vis'vâmitra.

 

41-59. It is well known that, in ancient days, the Jamadagni's son
Paras'urâm cut off his mother's head under the orders of his father. He
considered the father's words more important, and hence could do such an
unjust act. O king! This my body is at your disposal; I can certainly do
what you order me to do. So say what am I to do? as long as I am living,
you need not express any sorrow; if you permit, I will do what is even
hardly practicable to do. O king! Say why you are anxious; I will remove
that at once with this bow in my hand. If my body goes in carrying your
mandate know that your desire will be fructified. Fie to that son, who,
being capable, is averse to do what his father desires! What use is
there in having a son who does not remove the cause of his father's
anxiety? Hearing the words of the son, the king S’antanu felt much
ashamed in his heart and said :-- “O son! This is now my gravest care
that you are my only son; besides you are a hero very powerful, honoured
and never showing your back in battles; therefore, if, out of ill-luck
you become dead in some battlefield, I will become issueless; under such
circumstances what am I to do? So, O son! My life is fruitless when I
have got only one son; this is my gravest care; therefore I am sorry. O
son! I have no other cares that I can mention to you.” Hearing these
words of the father, Gângeya called the old ministers and said that the
king was too ashamed to speak out to me the real matter; so I ask you
all to know exactly the king's cares and communicate them to me as they
are; I can carry them out, without any hitch, then. At these Bhîsma's
words, the ministers went to the king, and learned the true cause, and
spoke to Bhîsma; learning this, he began to think what ought to be done.

 

The Gangâ's son Bhîsma, then, accompanied by the ministers, quickly went
to the house of the fisherman, and with words of humility and affection,
spoke :-- “O tormentor of foes! I pray to you to give your beautiful
daughter in marriage to my father. Your daughter will

 

 

be my mother and I will be her servant.” The fisherman, then, said :--
“O highly lucky prince! Then the king's son will not be able to become
king, in your presence; so kindly marry yourself my daughter.” At this
Bhisma again said :-- Let your daughter be my mother; I will never
accept the kingdom. The son of your daughter will, no doubt, become
king. The fisherman said :-- “I know your words are true; but if your
son be powerful, he can take forcibly the kingdom for himself.” At this
Bhîsma again said :-- “O Sire! Know my words as true; I will never
marry; from to-day I have accepted this difficult vow.” Sûta said :--
Hearing this firm resolve of Bhîsma; the fisherman gave over his
beautiful daughter to the king S’antanu. Thus S’antanu married the dear
Satyavatî; but he was quite unaware of the wonderful birth of Vyâsa
Deva.

 

Thus ends the fifth Chapter of the second Skandha on the marriage of
Satyavatî in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>a S’rîmad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000
verses.
