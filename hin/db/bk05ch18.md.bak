1-4. Mahi<u>s</u>a said :-- O Devî! Mandodarî had a sister Indumatî;
unmarried and endowed with all auspicious signs. She grew up in time to
a marriageable age. The Svayambara assembly (a marriage in which the
girl chooses her husband from among a number of visitors assembled
together) was then called for the marriage of the maiden Indumatî. The
Kings from various parts came there and the maiden Indumatî selected
from among them a beautiful strong king, of noble lineage and endowed
with all auspicious signs. At that time, by the undescribeable power of
Destiny, Mandodarî seeing the deceitful, cunning, and hypocrite King of
Madra, became passionate and desired to marry him.

 

5-17. That slender woman Mandodarî then addressed her father thus :-- “O
Father! Seeing the King of Madra in this assembly, I am desirous to
marry him; so perform also my marriage ceremony now.” When the king
heard this request from her own daughter privately, he became very glad
and began with promptness, to make preparations for the marriage. He
invited the King of Madra to his own palace and gave him in marriage his
own daughter Mandodarî, according to due rites and ceremonies with an
abundance of dowry and wealth. The King of Madra Chârude<u>sn</u>a
became very glad to marry the beautiful Mandodarî and went back with her
to his own abode. The King Chârude<u>sn</u>a then enjoyed her for good
many days; when one day a maid-servant found the king in sexual
intercourse with another maid-servant in a lonely place and divulged
this to Mandodarî; she finding the king in that state became angry and
rebuked him with a slight smiling countenance. Again, on another
occasion, Mandodarî saw the king willingly engaged in amusements and
sports with an ordinary beautiful woman and became very sorry and
thought thus :-- When I saw him in the Svayamvara, I could not recognise
him as a cheat; I am deceived by this King; Oh! What a wrong act have I
done through delusion. This King is a rogue and he is totally shameless
and has no dislike for contemptible things; it is now too late to repent
for him. How can I have any affection for this husband; fie on my living
now! I forsake from this very day all the pleasures with my husband and
all other worldly pleasures, and I take recourse now to contentment
alone. I have committed a very wrong act that I ought never to have
done; therefore it causes intense pain to me now. If I now commit
suicide, then that sin will never forsake me, and I must have to enjoy
the consequences thereof. And if I return to

my father’s house, I will not be happy there, for my companions seeing
me thus will, no doubt, ridicule me. Therefore, it is now advisable for
me to avoid all the sensuous pleasures, become dispassionate and remain
here patiently and abide by the strange combinations of Time.

 

18-20. Mahi<u>s</u>a said :-- Thus that women lamented and remorsed and
began to remain there, very much sorrowful and distressed, renouncing
thoroughly all the pleasures of the world. O Auspicious One! I am the
king, yet you are showing your dislike for me; know, eventually, you,
too, will be passionate and entertain afterwards an illiterate coward.
Keep my word even now, it will be of great benefit and it will serve as
a medicinal diet to you as to all women. In case you do not follow my
advice, you will have to meet with extreme pain and misery, certainly.

 

21-25. Hearing the words of Mahi<u>s</u>âsura, the Devî said :-- O you
fool! Go to the lower worlds or stand up for fight; I will send you and
the other Dânavas unto death and then go away at my pleasure. O Demon! I
take up form to preserve the righteous, whenever they suffer pain in
this earth. O Lord of the Daityas! Formless, birthless I am; yet, at
times, I take up form and be born to save the Devas. Know this firmly. O
wicked Mahi<u>s</u>a! The Devas prayed to Me for your destruction.
Therefore I will not rest until I kill you. I speak all these truly to
you. Therefore fight or go to Pâtâla, the abode of the Asuras; I speak
truly to you again that I will destroy you wholly.

 

26-51. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the Devî’s words, the Dânava
took up his bow and came to the battle, fully stretching the string of
his bow up to his ears, and began to shoot sharpened arrows with great
force at the Devî. The Devî, too, hurled with anger, arrows tipped with
iron and cut off the Asura’s arrows to pieces. The fight between them
rose to such a terrible pitch that it caused terror to both the Devas
and the Dânavas, trying hard to be victorious over each other. In the
midst of the terrible encounter, the demon Durdhara came up to fight and
made the Devî angry and shot arrows, all terribly poisonous and
sharpened on stones, at Her. The Bhagavatî, then, got very angry and hit
him hard with sharp arrows. Durdhara, struck thus, fell down dead on the
battlefield like a mountain top. The demon Trinetra, well skilled in the
uses of arrows and weapons, seeing him killed, came up to fight and shot
at the Great Goddess with seven arrows. Before these arrows came on Her,
She cut them to pieces with Her sharp arrows and by Her trident killed
Trinetra. Trinetra thus killed, Andhaka quickly came in the battlefield
and struck violently on the head of the lion with his iron club. The
lion killed that powerful Andhaka by striking the demon

with his nails and, out of anger, began to eat his flesh.
Mahi<u>s</u>âsura became greatly astonished at the death of these Asuras
and began to shoot pointed arrows, sharpened on stone, at Her. The Devî
Ambikâ cut his arrows into two before they came on Her and struck the
Demon on his breast by Her club. That vile Mahi<u>s</u>âsura, the
tormentor of the Devas, fell in a swoon under the stoke of the club but
patiently bore it and, at the next moment, came again and struck the
lion on his head by his club. The lion, too, by his nails rent that
great Asura to pieces. Mahi<u>s</u>âsura, then, quitting the man-form
took up the lion-form and by his claws cut the Devî’s lion and wounded
him very much by his nails. On Mahi<u>s</u>âsura taking up this
lion-form, the Devî became very angry and began to shoot arrows after
arrows at him all very terrible, sharp and like poisonous snakes. Then
the Asura quitting the lion form assumed the appearance of a male
elephant, oozing out juice from his temples and began to hurl the
mountain tops by his trunk. Seeing the mountain peaks thus hurled on
Her, She cut them off to pieces by Her sharp arrows and began to laugh.
The Devî’s lion on the other hand, sprang on the head of the elephant
Mahi<u>s</u>a and by his claws rent him to pieces. To kill the Devî’s
lion, then, Mahi<u>s</u>a quitted his elephant-form and assumed the
appearance of a Sarabha, more powerful and terrible than lion. The Devî
seeing that Sarabha became angry and struck on the head of that Sarabha
with Her axe; the Sarabha, too, attacked the Devî. Their fight became
horrible; Mahi<u>s</u>âsura, then, assumed the appearance of a buffalo
and struck the Bhagavatî by his horns. That horrible Asura, of hideous
appearance, swinging his tail, began to attack the thin bodied Devî.
That violent Asura caught hold of the mountain peaks by his tail and,
whirling them round and round, hurled them on the Devî. That vicious
soul, then, maddened with his strength, laughed incessantly and
addressed thus :-- “O Devî! Be steady in the battlefield. I will send
you today unto death, and your youth and beauty too. You are an
illiterate fellow as you have come maddened to fight with me. Really you
are deluded in your pretensions that you are very strong; this idea of
yours is absolutely false. I will kill you first and the hypocrite Devas
after who want to vanquish me by standing up a woman in their front.”

 

52-53. The Devî said :-- “O Villain! Do not boast; keep yourself firm in
the fight. Today I will kill you and make the Devas discard their fear.
O Wretch! You are a Sinner; you torment the Devas and terrify the Munis.
Let me have my drink of sweet decoction of grapes. And then I will slay
you undoubtedly.”

54-70. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Saying thus, the Devî, wrathful and eager
to kill Mahi<u>s</u>âsura, took up the golden cup filled with wine and
drank again and again. When the Devî finished Her drink of the sweet
grape juice, She pursued him with trident in Her hands, to the great joy
of gladdening all the Devas. The Devas began to rain showers of flowers
on the Devî and praised Her and shouted victories to Her with Dundubhi
(a Divine drum) Jai, Jîva; victory, live. The Ri<u>s</u>is, Siddhas,
Gandarbhas, Pis’âchas, Uragas, and Kinnaras witnessed the battle from
the celestial space and became very much delighted. On the other hand,
Mahi<u>s</u>âsura, the hypocrite Pundit, began to assume various magic
forms and struck the Devî repeatedly. The Devî Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ, then,
infuriated and with eyes reddened, pierced violently the breast of that
vicious Mahi<u>s</u>a with Her sharp trident. The Demon, then, struck by
this trident, fell senseless on the ground; but got up in the next
moment and kicked the Devî forcibly. That Great Asura, thus kicking the
Devî, laughed repeatedly and bellowed so loudly that the Devas were all
terrified with that noise. Then the Devî held aloft the brilliant discus
of good axle and of thousand spokes and loudly spoke to the Asura in
front :-- O Stupid! Look! This Chakra will sever your throat today; wait
a moment, I am sending you instantly unto death. Saying this, the Divine
Mother hurled the Chakra. Instantly that weapon severed the Dânava’s
head from his body. The hot streams of blood gushed out from his neck as
the violent streams of water get out from mountains, coloured red with
red sandstones. The headless body of that Asura moved, to and fro, for a
moment and then dropped on the ground. The loud acclamations of
“Victory” were sounded to the great joy of the Devas. The very powerful
lion began to devour the soldiers that were flying away, as if he was
very hungry. O King! The wicked Mahi<u>s</u>âsura thus slain, the Demons
that remained alive were terrified and fled away, very much frightened,
to Pâtâla. The Devas, Ri<u>s</u>is, human beings and the other saints on
this earth were all extremely glad at the death of this wicked Demon.
The Bhagavatî Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ quitted the battlefield and waited in a
holy place. Then the Devas came there with a desire to praise and chant
hymns to the Devî, the Bestower of their happiness.

 

Here ends the Eighteenth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the killing of the
Dânava Mahi<u>s</u>âsura in S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam, the Mahâ
Purâ<u>n</u>am of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
