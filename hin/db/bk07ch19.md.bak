**On the taking away of Haris’chandra’s Kingdom**

 

<span id="page_657">p. 657</span>

 

1-12. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing thus the words of the King
Haris’chandra, the Mahar<u>s</u>i Kaus’ika smilingly said :-- “O King!
This Tîrath is very sacred; if one bathes here, one is cleansed of one’s
sins and virtue springs up. So, highly fortunate One! Bathe in this and
do peace-offerings (tarpa<u>n</u>am) to your fathers. O King! This time
is very auspicious and highly meritorious; so take a bath in this sacred
Pu<u>n</u>ya Tîrtha and make charities as far as it lies in your power.
Svâyambhuva Manu says :-- He, who arriving at a tîrtha capable to give
high merits (Pu<u>n</u>ya), does not bathe and make charities, deceives
himself; so he is the slayer of his soul, no doubt. So, O King! Do
meritorious acts as best as you can in this excellent tîrtha. Then I
will shew you the way and you will go to Ayodhyâ. O Kâkutstha! Today I
will be pleased with your gifts and I will accompany you to show you the
way; this I have decided.” Hearing the deceitful words of the
Mahar<u>s</u>i, the King took off his upper garments and tying the horse
on to a tree, went towards the river to bathe according to due rites. O
King! The accidental combination, that was to have been so (sure to
come), so enchanted the King by the Muni’s words, that he got himself
entirely under the control of the Muni. He duly completed his bath and
offered peace offerings to the Devas and the Pitris and then spoke to
Vis’vâmitra. “O Lord! I am now making gifts to you. O Fortunate One!
Cows, lands, jewels, elephants, horses, chariots or horses, etc.,
anything that you like I will give you just now. There is nothing that I
cannot give. When I performed previously the Râjasûya

sacrifice, I took, then, before all the Munis, this vow. So, O Muni! You
are also present at this principal Tîrtha (place of pilgrimage); so
express what you desire; I will give you your desired object.”

 

13-15. Vis’vâmitra said :-- “O King! Your glory is spread far and wide
in this world; especially I have already heard that there is no second
man charitable like you. The Muni Vas’i<u>st</u>ha has said :-- The

King of the solar dynasty, the Tris’anku’s son, Haris’chandra is
foremost and first amongst the kings in this world and there is no one
so liberal-minded as he is; such a king there never was nor ever there
will be. So, O King! Now the marriage time of my son has arrived; so I
pray before you today, that you give me wealth to celebrate this
marriage.”

 

16\. The King said :-- “O Brâhmi<u>n</u>! Yes! Celebrate the marriage
ceremony; I will give you your desired wealth. What more can be said
than this that whatever wealth you would want, I will give that
abundantly. There is no doubt in this.”

 

17-22. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of the King, the Muni
Kaus’ika became ready to deceive him and originating the Gândharbî Mâyâ,
created a beautiful youth and one daughter aged ten years and showing
them to the King, said, “The marriage of these two is to be celebrated
today. O King! To marry the boys and the girls in the house-hold is to
earn more merits than the Râjasûya sacrifice. So today you will get that
desired fruit if you make charities for the marriage of this
Brâhmi<u>n</u> Youth.” The King was much enchanted by his Mâyâ; so no
sooner he heard those words, he immediately promised :-- “That will be
done,” he did not raise any objection whatsoever. Vis’vâmitra then
showed the way and the King went to his city. Vis’vâmitra, too, thus
deceiving the King, went back to his Âs’rama. When the King was staying
in Agnis’âlâ (cook-room), Vis’vâmitra Muni went to him and said :-- “O
King! The marriage rites have been finished; so today give me what I
desire in this sacrificial hall.”

 

23-24. The King said :-- “O Brâhmi<u>n</u>! Speak out what you want; now
I like to get fame. So if there be anything in the world, that is not to
be given by me, if you want, I will give that even to you, no doubt. The
mortal, possessing all wealth, if he does not earn good name and fame,
capable to give happiness to him in his next world, passes his life in
vain.”

 

25\. Vis’vâmitra said :-- “O King! Give to this bridegroom, while within
this sacred sacrificial altar, your entire kingdom with the royal
umbrella and Châmara for fanning the king and elephants, horses,
chariots, infantry and all the gems and jewels.”

26-33. Vyâsa said :-- O King! The King Haris’chandra was deluded by his
Mâyâ; so no sooner he heard the Muni’s words, he willingly said without
the slightest consideration :-- “O Muni! I give as you pray, my this
vast dominion to you.” The very cruel Vis’vâmitra then said :-- “O King!
I have accepted your offer; but O Intelligent One! Give now the
requisite Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â to complete your gift. Manu says gift
without Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â is fruitless; so to get the fruit of your
gift give Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â as duly fixed.” The King was exceedingly
surprised to hear this and said :-- “O Lord! Kindly say what amount of
wealth am I to give to you as Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â. O Saint! Say the
value of your Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â. O Ascetic! Don’t be impatient; I
will give you the Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â to that amount, no doubt.”
Hearing this, Vis’vâmitra told to the King :-- “At present give me two
and a half loads of gold as Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â.” The King
Haris’chandra became greatly amazed and promised :-- “I will give you
that,” he then anxiously mounted on his horseback and became ready to go
quickly. At this time, his soldiers who lost their road in quest of
their king, came to him. They were very glad to see him; but, seeing him
anxious, they began to praise him in great haste.

 

34-47. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing their words, the King did not say
anything, good or bad; but thinking on his own doing entered into the
zenana. Oh! What have I promised to give? I have made a gift of all that
I have; I am cheated in this matter by the Muni like one robbed by a
thief in a wilderness. My whole dominion including my dress I have
promised to give to him. Moreover I will have to pay besides two and a
half loads of gold. My brain seems to have been completely destroyed.
What to do now? I did not know the cunningness of the Muni. Therefore I
am cheated by this deceitful Brâhmi<u>n</u>. It is next to impossible to
understand the work of Daiva. Oh! My Fate! What will happen to me now?
Very much bewildered the King entered in the interior of the palace. The
queen seeing her husband immersed in cares, enquired into the cause,
thus :-- “O Lord Why have you become so absent-minded? Kindly say what
you are thinking now? O King! The son has come back from the forest
before you completed your Râjasûya sacrifice; why then are you in grief
now? Kindly speak out the cause of your sorrow. Nowhere is your enemy,
strong or weak; only Varu<u>n</u>a was angry with you; now he is also
very satisfied. So there is nothing further for you to do to think. O
King! Owing to cares, this body gets weaker and weaker day by day. So
nothing is like cares to lead one to death.” When his dear wife said so,
the King expressed to her somewhat the cause of his

cares, good or bad. But the King was much absorbed with his cares so
that he could not eat nor sleep though his bedding was perfectly white
and clear. Early in the next morning, when, getting up from his bed, he
was doing anxiously his morning duties, Vis’vâmitra came up there. When
the sentinel informed the King of the arrival of Vis’vâmitra, he gave
order for him to enter. Vis’vâmitra, the Looter of his all and
everything, came before him and told the King who repeatedly bowed down
to him :-- “O King! Now leave your kingdom and give me the gold that you
promised as Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â and prove that you are truthful.”

 

48-63. Haris’chandra said :-- “O Lord! I have given you this vast
dominion of mine; so my Kingdom has now become yours; I am leaving this
Kingdom and going to somewhere else. O Kaus’ika! You need not think a
bit for this. O Brâhma<u>n</u>a! You have taken my all according to the
technical rule; so now I am unable to give you Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â.
If, in time, wealth comes to me, I will at once give you your
Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â.” Saying him thus, the King told his wife S’aivyâ,
and his son Rohita, “In this Agnihotra room I say that I have given my
vast dominion to the Muni Vis'vâmitra. Elephants, horses, chariots, gold
and jewels all I have given to him along with my kingdom. What more than
this that save us three, everything else I have given to him. O
Mahar<u>s</u>i! Take fully this prosperous dominion; we are going
somewhere else to a forest or a mountain cave.” The exceedingly virtuous
Haris’chandra spoke thus to his wife and son, and, paying respects to
the Muni, went out from his house. Seeing the King going thus away, his
wife and son, afflicted with cares, followed him with their sad faces.
Seeing thus, all the inhabitants of Ayodhyâ cried aloud, and great
consternation and uproar arose in the city. O King! What is this act
that you have done? How has this suffering come to you! O King! The
great Fate, without any consideration, has certainly deceived you. The
Brâhma<u>n</u>as, K<u>s’</u>attriyas, Vais’yas and S’ûdras, all the four
Var<u>n</u>as gave vent to their sorrows, when they saw the King going
away with his wife and son. The Brâhmi<u>n</u>s and the other
inhabitants of the city, all were afflicted with sorrows and began to
abuse the vicious Brâhma<u>n</u>a saying that “He is a cheat, etc.” O
King! Give the gold for Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â and then go; or say that
you will not be able to give and I will then not take the
Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â. Or if you entertain within yourself any greed,
then take back all your Kingdom. O King! If you think that you have
really made this gift, then give what you have promised. The son of
Gâdhi was saying so, when the King Haris’chandra very humbly bowed down
to him with folded palms and said to him.

Here ends the Nineteenth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the taking away
of Haris’chandra’s Kingdom in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S'rî Mad Devî
