1-5. Janamejaya said :-- “O Brâhma<u>n</u>a! You have described in
detail the wonderful character of Indra, his displacement from his
Heavens, and his suffering many hardships and at the same time, you have
described very widely the greatness of the Highest Goddess of the world.
But one doubt has arisen in my mind that Indra was very powerful and
when he got the lordship over the Devas, which means in other words that
no trouble would pain him, how was it that he had to feel pain and
agony? He got the Lordship of the Devas and his highest position by
performing one hundred Horse Sacrifices; how was it, then that he was
again displaced from that position? O Ocean of mercy! Kindly explain to
me the causes of all these. You know everything; you are the best of the
Munis and the maker of the Purâ<u>n</u>as; I am your devoted disciple;
therefore nothing there can be that cannot be mentioned to me. So, O
highly fortunate One! Kindly remove my doubts.” Sûta said :-- Thus asked
by Janamejaya, Vyâsa the son of Satyavatî gladly spoke, in due order,
the following words :--

6-29. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hear, then the causes that are certainly
very wonderful. The seers say that Karma is of three kinds :-- Sañchita
(accumulated), Vartamâna (present) and Prârabdha (commenced). Each of
these is again subdivided into three, Sâttvik, Râjasik, and Tâmasik. The
accumulated effects of Karmas done in many past lives is called
Sañchita, O King! The effects of this Sânchita Karma, be it auspicious
or inauspicious, be it for a long or for a short time, must have to be
enjoyed by the beings whether they be good or bad. This Sañchita Karma
done by the embodied beings in several previous births, can never be
totally exhausted even in hundred Ko<u>t</u>i Kalpas without their being
enjoyed. The Karma that is being done by a Jîva and that has not as yet
been completed, that is called Vartamâna Karma. The Jîvas do this
Vartamâna Karma, auspicious or inauspicious, in their present
embodiments. At the time of birth, a part of the Sañchita Karma, the
soul takes up for fructification. This part of Sañchita Karma is called
Prârabdha Karma. This exhausts only when its effects have been fully
borne out by the embodied soul. The beings cannot but bear the effects
of this Prârabdha Karma. O King! Know this for certain that the effects
of merits or demerits done previously must be borne by anybody, be he a
Deva, or a man, or an Asura, or a Yak<u>s</u>a or a Gandharba. The acts
done previously go to form the new births of all beings. When the Karma
gets exhausted, then no more birth takes place. There is no doubt in
this. Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u, Rudra, Indra and the other Devas, the
Dânavas, Yak<u>s</u>as, Gandharbas, all are under the control of this
Karma. O King! Were it not so, how could they get bodies that are the
causes of the enjoyments of pains and pleasures of all the beings.
Therefore, O King! Out of the Sañchita Karmas done in many previous
births, some Karmas get ripe in due time and they manifest themselves;
those manifested Sañchita Karmas are called Prârabdha Karmas (those that
are being enjoyed by an individual in the present birth). Impelled by
this Prârabdha Karma, the Devas and the human beings, all do meritorious
acts as well as sinful acts. Thus Indra out of his past meritorious acts
attained his Indraship, and, out of his past sinful acts, committed the
sin Brahmahattyâ and so he was dislodged from his Indraship. What doubt
can exist here? O King! So Nara and Nârâyana, the sons of Dharma, had to
take births out of their previous Karmas; again Arju<u>n</u>a and
Kri<u>sn</u>a were born out of their Karmic effects as part incarnations
of this Nara and Nârâyana. The Munis describe this Karma as the basis of
the Purâ<u>n</u>as. Know that he is born of a Deva who is very wealthy
and prosperous; he who is not born of the part of a Muni, never writes
any spiritual treatise on Jñana or Knowledge; he who is not born of
Rudra, never worships Rudra; who is not born of a Deva never distributes
rice in charity; he who is not born

of S'rî Vi<u>sn</u>u, never becomes the king and lord of the earth. O
King! The embodied souls derive their bodies certainly from Indra, Agni,
Yama, Vi<u>sn</u>u, and Kuvera. Indra presides over lordship, Agni
presides over energy, Yama presides over anger, and Vi<u>sn</u>u
presides over strength. He who is powerful, fortunate, enjoying many
enjoyments, learned, charitable, is said to be born of a Devâms'a. O
Lord of the earth! Similarly the Pâ<u>nd</u>avas and Vâsudeva who was as
glorious as Nârâyana were born of Devâms'as. O King! Know this as quite
certain that the bodies of the Jîvas are the receptacles of pains and
pleasures; and the embodied souls (Jîvas) experience alternately
pleasure and pain. No Jîva is independent; he is always under the Great
Fate. He experiences birth, death, pleasure and pain, not out of his
self will, but compelled and guided, as it were, by the unseen Fate.

 

30-41. O King! How very strong is that Fate can easily be judged by the
following. The Pâ<u>nd</u>avas were born in forest; then they went their
own homes. They performed the Great Râjasûya Sacrifice by virtue of
their own strength. After this they had to suffer their exiles in forest
a much greater and more terrible hardship indeed! Next Arju<u>n</u>a
performed a very hard asceticism when the Devas, not self-controlled,
became pleased and granted him an auspicious boon. Still he could not
extricate himself from the hands of the terrible hardship; nowhere could
be found the fruits of the merits acquired in the past when he was
afterwards remaining in exile in his human body in the forest! The
severe tapasyâ that he did in the Vadarikâsrama in his past incarnation
as Nara, the son of Dharma, did not bear any fruit in his Arju<u>n</u>a
birth. Mysterious and inexplicable are the ways and means of Karma with
which the bodies of the several beings are concerned. How could men get
an idea of it when the Devas themselves are at a loss to solve it.
Bhagavân Vâsudeva had to take birth in the prison, a very critical and
dangerous place; he was then carried by Vasudeva to the milkman Nanda's
abode at Gokula; he remained there eleven years and thence came back to
Mathurâ where he killed by force Kamsa, the son of Ûgrasena. Then he
released his sorrowful father and mother from the bonds of prison and
made Ûgrasena, the King of Mathurâ. Afterwards he went to Dvârkâ city,
out of the fear of Kâla Yavana, the King of the Mlechchas; thus
Janârdana Kri<u>sn</u>a performed many great and heroic deeds, being
impelled by Fate. Then he left his mortal coil at Prabhâsa, a place of
pilgrimage, along with his relatives and acquaintances and then ascended
to his Vaikun<u>t</u>ha abode. All the Yâdavas, sons, grandsons,
friends, brothers, sisters and ladies of the houses all died under the
curse of a Brâhmi<u>n</u>. O King! I have thus described to you the
inexplicable ways of Karma.

What more shall I say than the fact that Vâsudeva was killed by the
arrows of a hunter!

 

Here ends the Tenth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the phase of Karma in
the Mahapurâ<u>n</u>am S'rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
