**Chapter XXII**

 

**On Sudars’ana’s marriage**

 

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

 

1\. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Then, on hearing his daughter’s words, that
high souled king of Benares, Subâhu, came to the spot where the kings
were staying and said :-- “O kings! Now you can go to your own camps;
tomorrow I will perform my daughter’s marriage ceremony.

 

2\. Let you all be pleased with me and graciously accept the food and
drink, given by me. Tomorrow let you all come here and perform my
daughter’s marriage ceremony.

 

3\. O Kings! My daughter is not coming today to this hall of Svayamvara;
what can I do now; I will console her and bring her here tomorrow.
Therefore do you all go now to your own camps respectively.

 

4\. Intelligent persons should not quarrel with the members of their own
family. But they should always shew kindness towards their own sons and
daughters who are under their protection. However, I will make my
daughter understand and bring her tomorrow morning. You may all go now
to your places as you desire.

 

5\. Tomorrow morning we will settle about the pledge, whether by choice
or by fulfilling a promise, that requires strength, and have the
marriage celebrated; or better you all together would decide what mode
of Svayamvara is to be adopted.”

 

6\. The kings heard Subâhu and trusted him. Then seeing that the city is
well guarded on all sides, they went to their own camps and performed
their mid-day duties.

 

7-8. The king Subâhu on this side began to perform all the duties
regarding the marriage of his daughter, after duly consulting with all
the chief members of the family. At the appointed time of marriage he
brought his daughter in a well concealed and guarded chamber, had the
bathing ceremony of the bridegroom elect performed by the priests,
versed in the Vedas, and had him well dressed and did other requisite
things. Then he brought the bridegroom in the house, made him seat on a
Vedî (platform) and duly worshipped him.

 

9\. Then the large-hearted king gave to the bridegroom seat, Âchamanîya
(water for rinsing the mouth and such articles of food as require
rinsing one’s mouth after eating them), Arghya (articles for worshipping
deservedly, pâdyam, e.g., water for washing the feet with an offer of
green grass, rice, etc., made in worshipping a God or a Brâhma<u>n</u>),
the two silken cloths and sheet, cows, and two ear-rings and then wanted
to give Sudars’ana his daughter.

10\. The high minded Sudars’ana accepted all the offerings given by the
king. Seeing this, Manoramâ was relieved of her anxiety. Manoramâ began
to think that beautiful and well adorned daughter as if the daughter of
Kuvera (the God of wealth); and thanked herself and thought as if all
her duties were over.

 

11\. Then the royal ministers carried gladly and fearlessly the
beautiful Sudars’ana, worshipped with ornaments and clothings, in a good
nice carriage to the centre of the amusement court.

 

12\. On the other hand, the elderly female members, who knew all about
the prescribed rules, performed the dressing of the princess in a
befitting manner and placing her in a beautiful conveyance took her
before the bridegroom elect, in the marriage hall, where there was the
platform regularly built.

 

13-14. The Sacred Fire was then lit, the royal priest began to perform
the Homa ceremony duly; when the amusement ceremony of the bridegroom
and bride united in love was duly performed, the priest called them
there. After this the bridegroom and bride performed duly the Lâjâ Homa
ceremony and circumambulated the Sacred Fire. Thus all the ceremonies,
befitting the gotra and family, were all fully performed according to
the prescribed rules.

 

15-17. Then the king Subâhu, excited by feelings of love, in the
marriage time, gave to the prince Sudars’ana the following presents:
well adorned two hundred chariots, with horses and the arrow cases
filled with arrows, one hundred and twenty five elephants, dressed with
golden ornaments, looking like so many mountains, one hundred beautiful
female elephants and one hundred maid servants, all dressed in golden
ornaments.

 

18-20. The king gave the bridegroom also one thousand servants well
adorned, bearing the complete set of all sorts of weapons, many gems and
jewels, clothings, nice variegated woolen clothes, beautiful capacious
rooms to live in, and two thousand excellent horses born in the Sindhu
country, three hundred good camels able to carry sufficient loads, and
two hundred carriages, filled with grains, etc.

 

21\. Then the king bowed to the king’s daughter Manoramâ and with
clasped hands, said :-- “O royal daughter! I am now become your servant;
now kindly say what is your desire?”

 

22\. Hearing these beautiful words of the king, Manoramâ said :-- “O
king! all good to you and let your family increase in sons and
grandsons. You have increased my honour by giving in marriage your
daughter (jewel) to my son. I have no other desire than to see your
welfare constant and the increase in your family, posterity and
prosperity.

 

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

 

23\. O king! Your are the chief amongst the kings. Your have made my son
great and strong like the Sumeru mountain by giving him your daughter in
marriage. You are high and my related. I am not the daughter of a
panegyrist or a bard; how can I then praise you for this noble act of
yours.

 

24-25. O king! Your character is wonderful and pure. What more shall I
say to you than this that you all, in the face of many other kings, have
given your daughter to my son in marriage, who is banished from his
kingdom, is deprived of his father and is living in the forest,
penniless, armyless, subsisting himself on roots and fruits only.

 

26\. In these cases the kings as a rule make relations with those only,
who are their equals in rank and position, of noble families of equal
grade, having forces and wealth equal to each other. No other king would
have offered his beautiful well-qualified daughter in marriage to my
prince who is without any wealth.

 

27\. O king! On your this act, all the other kings, holding great
influence and possessing armies, have turned out your enemies. I, being
a woman am unable to describe the amount of patience in you.”

 

28\. The king Subâhu of Benares, hearing the sweet words of Manoramâ was
highly pleased and, with folded hands, began to say, “O Devî, you better
take my this celebrated kingdom; I will become the commander of your
forces and will try my best to guard this city.

 

29\. Or you can take half of my kingdom and remain here with your son.
It is not my desire that you leave this Benares and go and live in the
forest.

 

30-31. The kings have become very offended; I will first try to appease
them; if they be not satisfied, I will adopt the means of “gift” or
sowing dissensions amongst them; and even, if, in that, I fail, I will
ultimately take to war. O Devî! Victory or defeat is under the hands of
the Destiny; still victory comes to those who are in the right path and
defeat to those who are in the wrong path. How then can the victor arise
to those sinful kings?”

 

32\. Hearing the king’s words, pregnant with meaning, Manoramâ felt
herself highly respected; and, with a cheerful heart, said the following
good words.

 

33\. “O king! let all good come on you! you better discard all fear and
reign with your sons here; my son Sudars’ana, too, will become the king
of Ayodhya by the Grace of S’rî Bhagavatî Bhuvanes’varî, the Supreme
Cause of the innumerable worlds, and will roam in this world; there is
no doubt in this.

 

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

 

34\. May Bhagavatî Bhavanî bring all good unto you; now kindly permit us
to depart to our homes, O king! I always contemplate the Highest Goddess
Ambikâ; and I have no time to indulge in other thoughts.”

 

35\. Thus, on various subjects, Manoramâ and the king Subâhu began to
talk with each other, causing satisfaction to both like nectar, when the
morning broke out.

 

36\. The kings, knowing early in the morning, that the princess had been
given away in marriage, became very much enraged and went out of the
city and began to discuss with one another.

 

“We will kill today the king Subâhu, the disgrace amongst the kings as
well that boy Sudars’ana, totally unfit to marry the princess, and take
away the kingdom and the princess S’as’ikalâ. How can we return to our
homes, with this severe disgrace, stamped on our heads.

 

37\. Hear, O kings! the sound of the drums, mridangas, other
instruments; the sounds of the conchshells have even been overpowered.
Hark! The various musical sounds and the chanting of the Vedas. It is
then certain that the King Subâhu has finished the marriage ceremony of
his daughter S’as’ikalâ with Sudars’ana.

 

38\. Oh! This king has deceived us with his words and performed the
marriage ceremony, according to ordinary religious rules.

 

39\. Now O kings! decide unanimously what to do and come to a definite
conclusion.”

 

When the kings were thus discussing, the king of Benares, of indomitable
prowess, the king Subâhu, after finishing his daughter’s marriage, came
there with his famous friends to invite them.

 

40\. Seeing the King of Benares present, all the other kings did not
utter a single word, but they remained silent, beaming with anger.

 

41\. Subâhu then approached to the kings, bowed down, and, with folded
hands, said :-- “Be kind enough to come to my house for dinner.

 

42\. O kings! My daughter S’as’ikalâ after all has selected Sudars’ana;
I could not help in this. You are all kind and noble; therefore you all
be peaceful and let the matter drop.”

 

43\. The kings hearing him were filled with rage and said, “We have all
taken food; our desires have been fulfilled; you better now go back to
your own home.

 

44-45. Your behaviour with us is all right and proper; now do your other
duties and let the kings go back to their homes.” Hearing these words of
the kings, the king of Benares was very much terrified and returned
home, thinking that the kings were all filled with rage and might do
serious harm to him. Thus he began to pass away his time in dire
anxiety.

 

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

 

46\. Then the king Subâhu disappeared; the kings united made this
resolve that they would block the passage of Sudars’ana, kill him, and
take the girl away.

 

47\. Some of these kings rather said :-- “What is the use in killing the
king’s son. We will all go willingly to see the fun.”

 

48\. Thus the kings went and remained blocking the path of Sudars’ana;
and the king Subâhu, on returning home, began to make arrangements for
the departure of the bridegroom and the bride.

 

Thus ends the 22nd Chapter on Sudars’ana's marriage in S’rî Mad Devî
Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
