1-5. Vyâsa said :-- O King! At this moment, the Muni Vis’vâmitra,
endowed with his power of tapas, came up there, very angry as if the God
of Death, to ask of his wealth. Seeing him Haris’chandra fallen thus
senseless on the ground, Vis’vâmitra, then, began to sprinkle water on
his body. O King! The man who is involved in a debt his troubles
increase day by day. So get up and pay your promised
Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â. The King, thus sprinkled with water, cold as
snow, regained his consciousness; but, seeing Vis’vâmitra, he fainted
again. At this, the Dvîja Vis’vâmitra consoled him and angrily spoke to
him thus :--

 

6-10. O King! If you want to maintain your steadiness, give, then my
Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â. Look! It is Truth that makes the Sun shine; It is
the Truth that has stationed this Earth in its position; what to speak
more, even the Svarga is established on Truth; so the greatest Dharma
lies in Truth. If the fruit of the thousand As’vamedhas be held in one
pan and Truth be held on the other pan of the balance, then Truth
outweighs the thousand horse sacrifices or what need I to speak all
about this! O King! If you fail to give my Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â before
the Sunset, I will, no doubt, curse you. Saying this, Vis’vâmitra went
away. The King also became very terrified. The wealthless King was
pained by the words of the Muni; but he was more troubled with the
thought how he would pay him and keep to Truth.

 

11-13. Sûta said :-- O Ri<u>s</u>is! At this time, a Brâhmi<u>n</u>,
skilled in the Vedas, with many other Brâhmi<u>n</u>s, started out of
his house, at that very place. The queen, then seeing the Brâhmi<u>n</u>
ascetic close by, addressed the King in words reasonable and in
accordance with the Dharma, O Lord! A Brâhmi<u>n</u> is considered the
father of the other three Var<u>n</u>as (i.e., K<u>s</u>attriyas,
Vais’yas, and S’ûdras) and a son can certainly take the father’s things;
so it is my intention that you beg your wealth from this Brâhmi<u>n</u>.

 

14-18. The King said :-- “O One of thin waist! To beg suits the
Brâhma<u>n</u>as; it is prohibited to the K<u>s</u>attriyas; I being a
K<u>s</u>attriya do not wish to take anything as gift. The
Brâhmi<u>n</u>s are the Gurus of all the Var<u>n</u>as. So they are
always to be respected. It is not proper to beg from a Brâhmi<u>n</u>;
especially the K<u>s</u>attriyas never ask anything from

the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s; it is totally prohibited. Offering oblations,
study, gift and the governing of subjects and protecting those that take
refuge is the Dharma of the K<u>s</u>attriyas but they would never,
never, ask any other man ‘Give, give,’ and utter these words indicative
of humility O Devî! The words ‘I am giving you’ are impressed within my
heart; so I will earn money from some other source and give that to the
Muni.”

 

19-20. The Queen said :-- “O King! Time keeps some men in one and the
same state; again it throws others into troubles; Time it is that gives
respect to one and again it is Time that gives disrespect to others.
Time it is that makes one a donor and it is the same Time that makes
another a beggar. So even the Ri<u>s</u>i Vis’vâmitra, learned and
endowed with the strength of Tapas, becoming angry has deprived you of
your kingdom and happiness and has thus done quite an irreligious act in
the shape of tormenting others. You can now judge in this the wonderful
workings of Time.”

 

21-22. The King said :-- “I would rather out off my tongue into two
pieces by a sharp sword than I would quit my K<u>s</u>attriya pride; and
I would never be able to utter the words ‘Give, give.’ O Fortunate One!
I am a K<u>s</u>attriya; so I never ask anything of anyone. I always say
that, by the strength of my arms, I will earn money and pay off my
debt.”

 

23-27. The Queen said :-- “O King! Indra and the other Devas have given
me over duly to your hands. So I am your religious (legal) wife;
especially I have got education and I ought to be protected. Therefore O
Luminous One! If you do not like to beg then you can sell me and pay off
your Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â.” The King Haris’chandra became grieved very
much to hear these words and lamented, saying, “O What a painful thing
is this! What a painful thing is this!” His wife again spoke :-- “O
King! Will we, afterwards, be burnt by the fire of curse from a
Brâhmi<u>n</u> and thus lowered very much? So keep my word now. You are
selling me, not because that you are infatuated with desire for gambling
nor you are deprived of all knowledge by enjoyments in worldly things
nor you are selling me owing to avert the danger of your kingdom. It is
that you are selling me to pay off the debt to your Guru. So nothing
sinful a fault will be incurred by you. So sell me and keep to Truth and
the fruits thereof.”

 

Here ends the Twenty-First Chapter of the Seventh Book on the
description of the sorrows of Haris’chandra in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am,
S'rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
