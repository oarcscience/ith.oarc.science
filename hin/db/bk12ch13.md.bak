1-4. Vyâsa said :-- O King Janamejaya! Thus I have answered all your
nice queries; also what Nârâya<u>n</u>a spoke to the highsouled Nârada
is also said by me. He who hears this greatly wonderful Purâ<u>n</u>am
S’rî Devî Bhâgavatam certainly becomes dear to the Devî and all his
actions become fructified with success. Now as regards your mental
distress, how you prevent any evil falling to your late father in his
future life, I advise you to do the Yajñâ in the name of Bhagavatî; and
certainly your father will be saved. And you also better take the Most
Excellent Mantra of the Mahâ Devî duly, according to rules; and your
human life will then be crowned with success; (your life will be saved;
thus you as well as your father will be saved).

 

5-12. Sûta said :-- O Ri<u>s</u>is! Hearing thus, the King asked Vyâsa
Deva to initiate in the Great Devî Mantra and thus to become his Guru.
He was then initiated duly according to rules with the Great Mantra of
Bhagavatî united with Pra<u>n</u>ava. When the Navarâtra period arrived,
he called Dhaumya and other Brâhma<u>n</u>as and performed the Navarâtra
Vrata so very dear to the Devî, according to his state. At this time for
the satisfaction of the Devî, he caused this Devî Bhâgavata
Purâ<u>n</u>a to be read by the Brâhma<u>n</u>as and fed innumerable
Brâhma<u>n</u>as and Kumârîs (virgins) and gave in charity lots of
things to the poor, orphans, and the Brâhmi<u>n</u> boys and thus
finished the Vrata. O Ri<u>s</u>is! Thus completing the Devîyajñâ, while
the King was sitting on his seat, the fiery Devar<u>s</u>i Nârada came
there from above playing with his lute. Seeing him there, all on a
sudden, the King got up, and paid due respects to him by asking him to
take his seat, with other necessary things. When the Devar<u>s</u>i
became relieved of his labour of journey, the King asked him about his
welfare and then enquired into the cause of his coming there.

 

13-19. O Devar<u>s</u>i! Whence and what for are you now coming? By your
arrival here I am become blessed and feel that my Lord has come to me;
now what can I serve to you; kindly command and oblige. Hearing this,
the Devar<u>s</u>i Nârada said :-- “O King! Today I saw in the Devaloka
a very wonderful event. I wanted eagerly to inform that to you. Hence I
have come here. Your father met with a bad turn of fate for his bad
action. I saw today he assumed a divine form and he was going on a
chariot. The Devas were praising him and the Apsarâs were encircling
him. It seemed he

was going in that dress to the Ma<u>n</u>i Dvîpa. O King! You performed
the Navarâtra Vrata and read the Devî Bhâgavata; it seems, as a result
of that, your father has now been rewarded with such a noble and good
turn of fate. Now you have become blessed and your actions have borne
fruits. You have delivered your father from the hell and so you have
become an ornament in your family. Today your name and fame have
extended to the Devaloka.”

 

20-30. Sûta said :-- O Ri<u>s</u>is! Hearing these words from the mouth
of Nârada, the King Janamejaya became very much happy and delighted and
fell prostrate at the feet of Vyâsa Deva of glorious deeds and said :--
O Best of Munis! By Thy Grace, today I have become blessed. Now what
return can I pay to Thee save bowing down to Thee. I pray that Thou dost
shew such favours to me ever and again. O Ri<u>s</u>is! Hearing these
words of the King Janamejaya, Vâdarâya<u>n</u>a Veda Vyâsa blessed him
and spoke to him in sweet words :-- “O King! Now leave all other
actions. Read always the Devî Bhâgavata and worship the Lotus Feet of
S’rî Devî. Leave off all laziness and now perform the Devî Yajñâ with
great eclât. And you will surely be able to cross this bondage of the
world. True there are various Purâ<u>n</u>as, the Vi<u>sn</u>u
Purâ<u>n</u>a, the S’iva Purâ<u>n</u>a, but those cannot compare with
one sixteenth of this Devî Bhâgavatam. In fact, this Purâ<u>n</u>a is
the Essence of all the Purâ<u>n</u>as. How can the other Purâ<u>n</u>as
be compared with this, wherein is established the Devî Mûla Prakriti?
Reading this Purâ<u>n</u>a from the beginning to the end yields the
result of reading the Vedas. So the wise persons should try their best
to study it always.” Thus saying to Janamejaya, Veda Vyâsa departed.
Then the pure minded Dhaumya and the other Brâhma<u>n</u>as highly
praised the Devî Bhâgavatam and went to their desired places. And the
King Janamejaya, on the other hand, began to read and hear always the
Devî Bhâgavatam and spent his days happily in governing his kingdom.

 

Here end the Thirteenth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the description
of Janamejaya’s Devî Yajñâ in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî
Bhâgavatam of 18000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
