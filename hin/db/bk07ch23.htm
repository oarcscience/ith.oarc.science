<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">1-5. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! Speaking these harsh and cruel words to the King, the Muni took that money and went away. When Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra went away, the King Haris&#146;chandra became very much perplexed with sorrows and sighed frequently. He then began to say with his face bent downwards. &#147;Suffering from constant pain and troubles, I am now turned into a Preta; if anybody finds me serviceable, he may purchase me with value in gold as proper; but he should do this quickly before the sun sets.&#148; Dharma, then, assuming the form of a heartless</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la, came there quickly to test Haris&#146;chandra. The body of that low mean person was of a black colour, his air looking ferocious, his belly elongated, body emitting stench odours, teeth very long, and his face, covered with beards. He had one bamboo in his hand; in his neck, the bones of the dead were hanging and his chest was very distorted.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">6. The Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la said :-- &#147;I am in urgent need of a servant; I will keep you as my slave; say, then, quickly what is your price?&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">7. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! When the cruel, extremely ferocious and heartless Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la said thus, the King Haris&#146;chandra was surprised to see his appearance and said :-- &#147;Who are you?&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">8-12. The Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la said :-- &#147;O King! I am the famous Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la, Prav&icirc;ra; you will have to remain always subject to me and to collect the clothes of the dead persons.&#148; Hearing his word, the King said, &#147;I want to be purchased by a Br&acirc;hmi<u>n</u> or a K<u>s</u>attriya. See! The sages say, that the Dharma of good people is excellent; the Dharma of the persons intermediate is middling; and the Dharma of the mean is depressing. You belong to the low and mean class. So my Dharma cannot be observed if I remain in your house.&#148; The Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la said :-- &#147;O King! This is the Dharma of yours now mentioned by you; then why did you mention that anybody can purchase you; without any previous consideration, you spoke before me. He who speaks with preconsideration attains his desired object; but, O Sinless One! You did not consider and you spoke that ordinarily. However, if I take your words that you spoke first to be true, then you are no doubt, purchased by me.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">13. Haris&#146;chandra said :-- The villain that speaks untruth, goes downright to a terrible hell; so to become a Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la is far better for me than to use an untrue word.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">14-15. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! When the King was speaking thus, the ascetic Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra arrived there out of anger and impatience; he rolled his eyes and said :-- This Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la is come to give you your desired money; why, then, are you not giving me the remnant of my Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>&acirc;!</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">16. Haris&#146;chandra said :-- &#147;O Kaus'ika! Nothing is unknown to you. My this body is born for the Solar Line; how then can I accept this slavery of a Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la!&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">17-20. Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra said :-- If you do not sell yourself to a Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la, be certain that I will just now put you under my curse. Give me immediately</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'"><A NAME="page_671"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 671</FONT></A></p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">my Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>&acirc;, be it whether from a Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la or from a Br&acirc;hma<u>n</u>a. There is no other purchaser at present than this Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la. But know this as certain that I won&#146;t go back until I get my money. O King! If you do not give me money just now, then when half the Ghatik&acirc; of the day is remaining, I will burn you up by my fire of anger.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">2l. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! Hearing these words of Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra, the King became almost dead; bewildered with fear, then he clasped the feet of the Ri<u>s</u>i and said, &#147;Be friendly, please.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">22-23. Haris&#146;chandra said :-- &#147;O Viprar<u>s</u>i! I am now very humiliated and have become very afflicted and distressed. Especially I am your Bhakta, I am your servant; so be graciously pleased and free me from this painful companion of a Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la. O Muni! In lieu of my remnant Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>&acirc;, I will be your obedient slave; I will do your work and follow your commands.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">24. Visvamitra said :-- &#147;O King! You are then my slave, you will obey always my commands.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">25-26. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! When Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra said so, the King, out of joy, thought that he regained his life and said to Kaus&#146;ika. Always I will obey your words; now order me what work I will have to do.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">27-28. Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra, then addressed the Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la and said :-- &#147;O Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la! Come to me and give me the price for this slave. I am now handing this slave over to you; give me the price and take him. I want money; I have no need for a servant.&#148;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">29. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! When Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra spoke thus, the Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la, overflowed with joy, came immediately to the Ri<u>s</u>i Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra and said :-- </p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">30. O Dv&icirc;ja! The relief that you have given me by selling this servant, for that I will give you the ten Yoyanas wide land  of Pray&acirc;ga Ma<u>nd</u>alam, covered over with jewels.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">31-36. Vy&acirc;sa said :-- O King! The Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la then gave one thousand gems, one thousand jewels, one thousand pearls and one thousand gold Mohurs and Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra took them. No signs of distraction nor unpleasantness were visible on the face of the King Haris&#146;chandra. Rather he laid hold of his patience and thought within himself, &#147;Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra is now my master; I will do any work that he puts</p>

<p align="none;text-autospace:none'"><A NAME="page_672"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 672</FONT></A></p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">me in.&#148; At this time, the incorporeal voice, the voice of the fourth dimensional space, sounded from the Heavens :-- &#147;O Fortunate One! You are freed from the Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>&acirc;, the debt before that you promised to give me.&#148; A shower of flowers fell on the head of the King from the Heavens. At this time the powerful Indra and the other hosts of the Devas praised the King, saying :-- &#147;S&acirc;dhu! S&acirc;dhu! Well-done, Well-done.&#148; The heart of the King was then filled with intense joy and the King then said to Kaus&#146;ika :-- </p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">37-38. O Intelligent One! You are a greater benefactor to me than my father, mother and friend as you have freed me in a moment from my debts. So, O mighty armed one! Your words are beneficial to me. Now order what am I to do.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">39. When the King said so, Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra then said :-- Go and observe from today the words of the Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la. Let good befall on you! Thus saying, the Mahar<u>s</u>i Vis&#146;v&acirc;mitra took the money given by the Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la and went away to his own place.</p>   
<p align="none;text-autospace:none'">&nbsp;</p>   
<p>Here ends the Twenty-third Chapter of the Seventh Book on the King Haris&#146;chandra&#146;s acknowledging of the slavery of the Ch&acirc;<u>nd</u>&acirc;la in the Mah&acirc;pur&acirc;<u>n</u>am S'r&icirc; Mad Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vy&acirc;sa.</p>
