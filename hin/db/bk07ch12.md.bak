1-6. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus giving the advice to his son, the King
Tris’anku was excited with feelings of love and, in a choked voice, said
to his father that he would fulfil what he had been ordered. The King
then called the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s, versed in the Vedas and Mantrams, and
had all the materials for installation collected quickly. He brought the
waters from all the sacred places of prigrimages; he then called
together with great respect all the kings. On a sacred day, the father
installed his son on the throne and gave him, in accordance with due
rites and ceremonies, the royal throne. The King then adopted with his
wife the third Vânaprastha stage of life and practised a severe tapasyâ
on the

banks of the Ganges. Then in due course of time the King went to the
Heavens. There he began to shine like a second Sun by the side of Indra,
respected by all the gods.

 

7-10. Janamejaya said :-- “O Bhagavân! You spoke before in course of
conversation that Satyavrata was cursed by Vas’i<u>st</u>ha on the
killing of his cow to become a Pis’âcha; how then he got himself freed
of this curse. There is a doubt on this point. Kindly clear it and
oblige. Satyavrata was cursed; hence pronounced unfit to succeed to the
throne. How was the Muni, by what actions, was he freed of the curse?
How could the father bring back to his home his son of the form of a
Pis’âcha? O Viprar<u>s</u>i! Kindly narrate to me how the Muni was freed
of his curse.”

 

11-18. Vyâsa said :-- Cursed by Vas’i<u>st</u>ha, Satyavrata became then
and there transformed into a Pis’âcha, very ugly, violent and terrible
to all; but when he worshipped the Devî with devotion, immediately the
Devî gave him a beautiful divine body. By the grace of the Devî, his
sins were all washed away and his Pis’âcha form vanished. Satyavrata,
then, freed from his sins became very much vigorous and energetic.
Vas’i<u>st</u>ha also became pleased with him, blessed thus by the
Supreme Force and so was his father, too. When his father died, the
virtuous Satyavrata became King, governed his subjects and performed
various sacrifices and worshipped, too, the Eternal Mother of the Gods.
O King! Tris’anku had a very beautiful son born to him, named
Haris’chandra, endowed in all his limbs with auspicious signs. The King
Tris’anku wanted to make his son Yuvarâja (the Crown prince) and then in
his that very body while living, enjoy the Heavens. The King went to the
Âs’rama of Vas’i<u>st</u>ha and gladly asked him, with folded palms,
bowing down before him duly.

 

19-23. O Ascetic! You are the son of Brahmâ , versed in all the Vaidik
Mantrams; so you are exceedingly fortunate; now I beg to inform you one
thing; hear it gladly. I now desire to enjoy the happiness of the
Heavens and all the enjoyments of the Devas, while I am in this body. To
enjoy in the Nandana Garden, to live with the Apsarâs and to hear the
sweet music of the Devas and the Gandharbas, these ideas now have taken
a strong hold of my heart. Therefore, O Great Muni! Engage me in such a
sacrifice as will enable me, in this very body to live in the Svarloka.
O Muni! You are fully competent to do this; therefore be ready for this.
Have the sacrifice done and let me have quickly the Devaloka, so
difficult to be obtained!

 

24-26. Vas’i<u>st</u>ha said :-- “O King! It is exceedingly hard to live
in the Heavens while in this mortal body. The departed only live in the

 

<span id="page_634">p. 634</span>

 

Heavens by their merits, this is a known fact. Therefore, O Omniscient
One! Your desire is hard to be attained. I am afraid of this. O King!
The living men can hardly enjoy the Apsarâs. Therefore, O Blessed One!
Do the sacrifice first. Then, when you leave this body, you will go to
the Heavens.”

 

27-31. Vyâsa said :-- O King! The Mahar<u>s</u>i Vas’i<u>st</u>ha was
already angry with the King; therefore when he spoke these words, the
King heard and became absent-minded. He again spoke to the
Mahar<u>s</u>i :-- O Brâhma<u>n</u>a! If you do not allow me to do the
sacrifice, on account of your haughtiness, I will have the sacrifice
performed now by another priest. Vas’i<u>st</u>ha became very angry at
the words of the King and cursed him :-- “O evilminded One! Be as soon
as possible a Châ<u>nd</u>âla in this body. You have committed acts by
which your path to the Heaven is obstructed. You have stolen a
Brâhmi<u>n</u>i’s wife, and defiled the path of religion; you have
killed the Surabhi Cow and you are a libertine. Therefore, O Sinner!
Never you will go to the Heavens, even after your death.”

 

32-56. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing these harsh words from the Guru,
Tris’anku became immediately Châ<u>nd</u>âla in that very body. His
golden earrings became turned into iron; the sweet sandal smell over his
body smelled like faeces; his beautiful yellow clothings became blue,
the colour of his body became like that of an elephant, due to his
curse. O King! Those who are the worshippers of the Supreme Force can
produce such things when they are angry; there is not the slightest
doubt in this. Therefore one ought never to insult any devotee of the
Supreme Force. The Muni Vas’i<u>st</u>ha is always engaged in repeating
silently the Gâyatrî of the Devî. So what wonder is there that the body
of the King will be reduced to such a wretched state by his rage. The
King Tris’anku became very sorry to see his ugly body; he did not go
home; rather he remained in the forest in that form and poor dress. He
began to think, distressed with sorrow and over-powered with misery :--
“My body is now blameable to the extreme, so what to do and where to go
in this wretched state! I find no remedy to exhaust all my sufferings.
If I go home, my son will be, no doubt, very much pained with sorrow. My
wife, when she will see my Châ<u>nd</u>âla appearance, she won’t accept
me; my ministers will not regard me as they used to do before. My
friends and relations, when they will come to me, will not serve me with
the former care. So it is far better to die than to live, thus despised.
I will drink poison or drown myself in waters or hang myself. Or I will
burn myself in the funeral pyre duly or I will quit this blameable life
by starvation. But, Alas! I will be guilty of

 

<span id="page_635">p. 635</span>

 

suicide; so again due to this sin I will be born a Châ<u>nd</u>âla and I
will be again cursed.” Thus thinking, the King again thought that at
present he ought not to commit suicide by any means. “I will have to
suffer for my Karma; and, after due suffering, this Karma will be
exhausted. So I will suffer in this forest for my Karma in this my body.
Without the enjoyment of the fruits, the past actions can never die out;
therefore all actions done by me, auspicious or inauspicious, I will
enjoy or suffer in this place. Always to remain close to a holy Âs’rama,
to wander in holy places of pilgrimage, to remember the Devî Ambikâ, and
to serve the saints will now be my duties. Thus I will no doubt exhaust
all my actions, residing in this forest; then, if chance permits, and if
I meet with a saintly person, all my intentions will be crowned with
success.” Thus thinking, the King quitting his city went to the banks of
the Ganges and repenting very much, remained there on the Ganges. The
King Haris’chandra came to know the cause of his father’s curse and with
a sorrowful heart sent ministers to him. Like a Châ<u>nd</u>âla, the
King was respiring frequently; at this time the ministers went to him
and bowing humbly, said : -- O King! Your son has ordered us to come
here; we have come at his command; we are the ministers of the King
Haris’chandra. Know this verily, O King! Kindly hear what the Crown
Prince has said :-- “Go and bring my Father here without any delay.”
Therefore, O King! Cast aside your mental agonies and come to the city.
The ministers, the subjects all will be always at your service. We will
all try our best to please Vas’i<u>st</u>ha, so that he may favour you.
And that greatly illustrious Muni being pleased will certainly remove
your sorrows quickly. O King! Thus your son has spoken to us many words;
so now be pleased to go to your own abode.

 

57-64. Vyâsa said :-- O King! That Chândâla-like King, hearing even
their words thus, did not consent to go back to his house. Rather he
told them :-- “Ministers, go back, all of you to the city; and at my
word, tell my son that I won’t go back to my house. Better leaving off
all idleness, you better govern the Kingdom carefully. Shew your respect
specially to the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s and perform various sacrifices and
worship the Devas. I do not like in this blameable Châ<u>nd</u>âla form
to go to the city of Ayodhyâ with the high-souled ones; so you all go
back to Ayodhyâ without any further delay. Install, at my order, my
powerful son Haris’chandra on the throne and do all these stately
duties.” When the ministers heard thus the King ordering them, they
began to cry very much, and, bowing down, they went away early out of

 

<span id="page_636">p. 636</span>

 

the hermitage. On coming back to Ayodhyâ they regularly installed on a
sacred day the King Haris’chandra with Abhi<u>s</u>eka water, purified
with Mantrams. Thus the powerful virtuous Haris’chandra, on being
installed on the royal throne by the command of the King, remembered
always his father and began to govern his Kingdom with his ministers
according to the dictates of Dharma.

 

Here ends the Twelfth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the description of
Vas’i<u>st</u>ha’s curse on Tris’anku in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S’rî
Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
