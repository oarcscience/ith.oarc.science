1-3. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus granting the boon to the Goddess
Lak<u>s</u>mî, S’ambhu quickly returned to the lovely Kailâs’a, adorned
with Apsarâs (celestial nymphs) and frequented and served by the Gods.
He then despatched his expert attendant Chitrarûpa to Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha
to bring the purpose of Lak<u>s</u>mî to a successful issue. He said to
him thus :-- “O Chitrarûpa! Go to Hari and speak to him on my behalf
that

He would go and remove the sorrows of His distressed and bereaved wife
and thus make Her comfortable.”

 

4-9. Thus ordered, Chitrarûpa started immediately and reached at once
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha, the highest place, covered all over by the
Vai<u>sn</u>avas. The place was diversified with lots of various trees,
with hundreds of lovely lakes, and echoed with sweet lovely sounds of
swans, Kâran<u>d</u>avas, peacocks, parrots, cuckoos and various other
birds and adorned with beautiful places, decked with flags and banners.
It was filled with charming dancings, music and other artistic things.
There were the lovely Bakula, As’oka, Tilaka, Champaka and other trees;
and the beautiful tree Mandâra looked beautiful and shed all around the
sweet fragrance of its sweet flowers for a long distance. Thus seeing
the lovely nice palace of Vi<u>sn</u>u and the two doorkeepers Jaya and
Vijaya standing with canes in their hands, Chitraratha bowed down to
them and said :-- Well! You go quickly and inform the Supreme Soul Hari
that a messenger has come under the orders of the Bhagavân
S’ûlapâ<u>n</u>î and is now waiting at His doors.

 

10-18. Hearing his words, the intelligent Jaya went to Hari and, with
folded hands, said :-- “O Thou Ocean of Mercy! O Kes’ava! O Lord of
Ramâ! O Deva of the Devas! A messenger has come from the Lord of Bhavânî
and is waiting at the doors. I do not not know on what important
business he has come. Please order whether I will bring him before You
or not. On hearing the Jaya’s words, Hari, aware of the inner feelings,
knew at once the cause and said :-- O Jaya! Bring before me the
messenger come from Rudra. Thus hearing, Jaya called the S’iva’s
servant, of a graceful form, and brought him to the presence of
Janârdana. Chitrarûpa, of variegated appearance, prostrated himself flat
before Him in the form of a stick and stood up and remained with folded
hands. The Bhagavân Nârâya<u>n</u>a, Whose carrier is Garu<u>d</u>a, saw
that servant of S’iva, of variegated appearance and full of all
humility, and became very much astonished. The Lord of Kamalâ then
smiled and asked Chitrarûpa :-- “O Pure One! Is it all well with
Mahâdeva, the Lord of the Devas and his other families and attendants?
On what business has He sent you here? What does He want me to do? Or
tell me if I have to do any other business of the gods.”

 

19-34. The messenger said :-- “O Thou, the Knower of all that is within
one’s heart! There is nothing in this world hidden from Your knowledge;
when is that which I will say unknown to you! O Thou, the Knower of
present, past and future! I am now saying to you what S’ambhu has told
me to inform You. He has said :-- O Lord! The Goddess Lak<u>s</u>mî is
Your dear consort. She, the daughter of the Ocean, and the Bestower of
all

success, though an object fit to be meditated by Yak<u>s</u>as,
Kinnaras, Naras and Immortals, is now undergoing severe penance at the
confluence of Kalindî (the Jumnâ, the daughter of Kalinda) and the
Tamasâ. What is there in the three worlds that can be happy without that
Mother of the worlds and the Giver of all desires? O Lotus-eyed One!
What pleasure do You feel in abandoning Her? O All-pervading One! Even
he who has no riches or who is very weak maintains his wife; then why
have You, being the Lord of the worlds, forsaken your wife, without any
offence, Who is worshipped by the whole universe. O Lord of the world!
What advice shall I give to You? He whose wife suffers in the world, is
blamed by his enemies. O Omnipresent One! Fie on his such a life! O Lord
of the worlds! Your enemies’ desires are satisfied when they see Her
very miserable. They are laughing and mocking and saying :-- O Devî,
Kes’ava has now forsaken you; you can spend happily your time with us
now. Therefore, O Lord of the Devas! Bring that Lady back unto your
palace and place Her unto your lap, Who is of good demeanour, beautiful,
par excellence and endowed with all auspicious signs. O Deva! Accept,
please, your sweet-smiling wife and be happy. Though I am at present not
in bereavement of my dear wife, yet when I remember my former state of
bereavement, I feel very much trouble. O Lotus-eyed One! When Satî Devî,
my beloved Wife, quitted Her life, in Dak<u>s</u>a’s house, I felt
unbearable pain, O Kes’ava! Let no other body in this world suffer such
pain, I now remember only the suffering and mental agonies that I felt
on Her bereavement; I do not give it out to others. After a long time,
practising severe Tapasyâ (asceticism) I got Her back in the form of
Girijâ, who felt herself burnt up as it were by the anger She felt on
account of censure cast on Me in the Dak<u>s</u>a’s house and thus
quitted Her life. O Murâri! What happiness you have felt in forsaking
your dear wife and in remaining thus alone for one thousand years.
Console your fortunate young wife with good teeth and bring her back to
your place. O Bhagavân! Lastly, the Lord Bhavânî, the Originatrix of
these worlds, told me to speak thus to you :-- O Destroyer of
Ka<u>m</u>sa! Let nobody remain even, for a moment, without
Lak<u>s</u>mî, the Highest Goddess. O Long-lived One! You better assume
the form of a horse and go and worship her. Then have a child of yours
in the womb of your sweet-smiling wife and bring her back to your
house.”

 

35-42. Vyâsa said :-- O Ornament of Bhârata’s race! Hearing thus the
words of Chitrarûpa, Bhagavân Hari told that he would do what S’ankara
had told him to do and thus sent the messenger back to S’ankara. The
messenger departing, Hari assumed the form of a beautiful horse

and immediately left Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha with a passionate intent for the
place where Lak<u>s</u>mî was staying in the form of a mare and
practising her austerities. Coming there, he saw that the Devî Bimalâ
was staying in the form of a mare. The mare, too, seeing the horse form
of her husband Govinda, recognised him and, chaste as she was, remained
there with astonishment and tears in her eyes. Then those two copulated
on the famous confluence. The wife of Hari, in the shape of a mare,
became pregnant and, in due time, gave birth to a beautiful well
qualified child. The Bhagavân then graciously smiled on her and spoke in
words suited to the time, “O Dear! Now quit this mare form and assume
your former appearance. O Lovely-eyed One! Let both of us assume our own
forms and go to Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha; and let your child remain in this
place.”

 

43-48. Lak<u>s</u>mî said :-- “O Lord! How can I go leaving here this
child, born of my womb. It is very difficult to quit the attachments for
one’s own child. Know this, O Lord! O High-souled One! This child is
young and of small body; therefore it is quite incapable to protect
itself. If I forsake it on the bank of this river, it will be an orphan,
what will happen to it then? O Lotus-eyed One! My mind is now in full
attachment towards it. How can I quit this helpless child and go?” When
Lak<u>s</u>mî and Nârâya<u>n</u>a resumed their divine bodies and
mounted on the excellent Vimânas, the Devas began to praise them with
hymns. When Nârâya<u>n</u>a expressed his desire to go, Kamalâ said :--
“O Lord! You better take this child; I am unable to forsake it. O Lord!
O Slayer of Madhu! This child is dearer to me than my life; see its body
resembles exactly like you. Therefore we would take this child with us
to Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha.”

 

49-54. Hari spoke :-- “O Dear! You need not be sorry; let this child
remain here happily; I have arranged for its preservation and safety. O
Beautiful One! There is a great act to do in this world. That will be
executed by your child. For this reason I am leaving it here. I am now
describing to you the above story. The famous King Yayâti had a son
named Turvasu; his father kept his name as Hari Varmâ; he is known by
this name. That king is now practising asceticism for getting a son for
one hundred years in a place of pilgrimage. O Lak<u>s</u>mî! I have
begot this son for him. I will go there and send the King here. O
Beautiful-faced One! I will give this son to that King, desirous of an
issue. He will take this son and go back to his house.”

 

55\. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus consoling his beloved, whose abode is
in the Lotus and placing the child there in that position, He mounted on
an excellent car with Lak<u>s</u>mî and went to Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha.

Here ends the Nineteenth Chapter in the Sixth Book on the origin of
Haihayas from a mare in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam
of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
