1-34. Sûta said :-- O Mahar<u>s</u>is! When the king Sudyumna had gone
up to heavens, the religious king Pururavâ, endowed with great beauty
and many qualities, and able to please the minds of his subjects began
to govern his kingdom well, according to Dharma, with his heart intent
on governing his people. No body knew what his counsel was, but he was
very clever in knowing others' counsels. He was always highly energetic
and his lordly power was great. The four methods of warfare, (1)
con-ciliation, (2) giving gifts, (3) sowing dissensions and (4) war,
were fully under his control. He saw that his subjects practised
religion according to Varnâs'ram (Colours and stages of life), and thus
he began to govern his kingdom. Pururavâ, the lord of men, performed
various sacrifices with abundance of Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>âs (sacrificial
fees) and also gave away much in various charities, causing great wonder
and astonishment. His extra-ordinary beauty and qualities, liberality
and good nature, his unbounded wealth and prowess made the Apsarâ
Urvas’î (celestial nymph) think of him often and she wanted him to
satisfy her. Some time passed when that procud Urvas'î had to descend on
this earth, due to a curse pronounced on her by a Brâhmin; and she chose
the king Pururavâ as her husband, thinking him to be endowed with all
the qualities. She then addressed the king and made the following
contract :-- “O king, giving honour due to every body! I keep these two
young sheep in trust and deposit with you; kindly look after these and,
then, my honour will be preserved by you. O king! I will take ghee daily
and nothing else for my food; and there is one word more; O king! Let me
not see you naked, except when you hold sexual intercourse. O king I say
this truly, that, in case there be any breach in this contract I will
instantly leave you and go away.” The king accepted this contract of
Urvas’î. Urvas’î, too, remained there according to the above contract
and also with a view to pass away the period of her curse. During this
time the king was fascinated with the love of Urvas’î and became so very
much attached to her, that he left all his duties and dharma and
remained long for many, many years in enjoying Urvas’î. The king's mind
was so deeply absorbed in her, that he could not remain alone without
her,

even for a moment. Thus many years passed away, when, once on a time,
Indra, the lord of the Devas, not seeing Urvas'î, asked the Gandarbhas
and said :-- “O Gandarbhas! Better go and steal away the two young sheep
in a proper time from the palace of Pururavâ, and then bring Urvas'î
here. My Nandana garden is now void of all beauty without Urvas’î; so
bring the lady here any how or other.” Thus spoken by Indra, Vis'vâvasu
and other Devas went to Pururavâ's palace; and when it was dark in the
night, and when Pururavâ was holding sexual intercourse with Urvas’î,
stole away the two young sheep. They, when being carried away in the
sky, cried out so piteously that Urvas’î came to hear that as if of her
two sons, and angrily spoke to the king :-- “O king! Now the contract
that I made with you is verily fulfilled! It is that I placed my
implicit confidence on you that this my misfortune has befallen on me;
See! the thieves are stealing away the two sheep, my sons as they were!
How then are you sleeping here like a woman? Alas! I am ruined in having
an impotent husband who vainly boasts of his prowess!

 

Where are my two young sheep to-day that are dearer to me than my life?”
Thus seeing Urvas’î wailing, the king Pururavâ, the lord of the
Universe, ran after the Gandharvas instantly without any sense as it
were, left in him, naked. The Gandharvas, then, cast rays of lightning
in that room, and Urvas’î, willing to leave, saw the king naked when the
Gandharvas left the two young sheep there and went away. The tired king
brought the two sheep back to his house in that naked state. Then
Urvas’î, too, seeing the husband naked, went away immediately to the
Devî loka. Seeing Urvas’î going away, the king wailed very much with a
very grievous heart. Then, being very much bewildered by the bereavement
of Urvas’î, with his senses beyond control, and deluded by passion,
wandered about in various countries, crying and giving vent to sorrow.
Thus, wandering all over the globe, he came once to Kuruk<u>s</u>ettra
and saw Urvas’î; then with a gladdened face said :-- “O beloved! Wait,
wait for a moment; my mind is all absorbed in you; it is quite innocent
and submissive to you. So you ought not to forsake me in such a dire
difficult time. O Devî! For the sake of you, I have travelled very far.
O Beautiful one! The body that you embraced before, will now, forsaken
by you, fall here and will be devoured by crows and wolves, and other
carnivorous animals.” Seeing the king, tired and passion stricken,
greatly distressed and with a very sorrowful heart and wailing, Urvas’î
spoke out :-- “O king! You are certainly a quite senseless man; whither
has gone your extraordinary knowledge now? O king! Do you not know that
the pure unalloyed love of women cannot take place with any other as the
love of a wolf cannot fall on any man. Therefore the earthly men ought
never to trust a bit to women and thieves. So go

back to your palace and enjoy the pleasures of the kingdom; do not drown
your mind further in sorrows.” The king Pururavâ, though thus brought to
senses by Urvas’î, was so much fascinated by her love that his heart did
not feel any consolation; rather he felt indescribable pain, being held
up in bondage by the love of Urvas’î. O Munis! Thus I have described to
you the character of Urvas’î; it is described, in detail, in the Vedas;
I have stated this in brief.

 

Thus ends the thirteenth chapter of the 1st Skandha of the characters
Urvas’î and Pururavâ; in the Mahâpurânam S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of
18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
