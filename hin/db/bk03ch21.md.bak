<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

 

1\. Vyâsa said :-- On hearing the sound words of his daughter
S’as’ikalâ, pregnant with reason, Subâhu the king of Benares, became
very anxious and began to think what he would now, so short a space of
time in this momentous occasion, thus :--

 

2-3. “The powerful kings, all, have come here on intention that they
would fight and therefore they are all attended with their armies and
followers respectively; and they are now sitting on their respective
daises in the Svayamvara hall. If I go now and tell them that my
daughter

 

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

 

S’as’ikalâ is not willing to come of her own accord in the hall, the
evil minded kings will certainly kill me out of their wrath.

 

4\. I have not so much strength, whether in my army or in forts, as to
be able to decline these kings and drive them away from my kingdom.

 

5\. Sudars’ana, too is, alone, helpless, wealthless, and a mere boy.
What shall I do now? Alas! I am now plunged in deep sorrow.”

 

6\. Thinking thus, with head bowed down by humility, the king went to
the kings, and said thus :--

 

7\. “O Kings! The girl, though requested repeatedly by me and her
mother, is not willing to come to this hall. What can I do now?

 

8-9. I am your servant and, bowing my head at the feet of you all, pray
to you, to accept my worship and return to your own cities respectively.
I am ready to give a sufficient quantity of gems and jewels, clothes,
elephants, chariots. Kindly accept these and go back to your own homes.

 

10\. My daughter is as yet a girl; if I chastise her, she may commit
suicide; and I will be exceedingly sorry; therefore I am very much
distressed with this thought.

 

11\. You all are fortunate, energetic, and of a merciful disposition;
what will it serve you to accept the daughter of mine, who is
disobedient and unfortunate?

 

12\. I am your obedient servant; shew your mercy on me and it is your
duty to consider my daughter as your own daughter.”

 

13\. Vyâsa said :-- Hearing Subâhu's words, the kings did not utter a
single word; but Yudhâjit, with his eyes reddened out of wrath, began to
address the king of Benares in an angry tone :--

 

14\. “O King! You are a veteran fool; what do you say now after
committing a most blameable act? Had you any doubt as to your
proceedings, why have you, out of sheer delusion, called this meeting
hall of Svayamvara, without thinking the matter before-hand.

 

15\. You have invited the kings and princes in this marriage ceremony
Svayamvara; and they all have assembled here; how can they now go back
to their homes?

 

16\. Are you going now to insult these? and will you give your daughter
in marriage to Sudars’ana? Nothing can be more ignoble than this?

 

17\. The welfare-seeking person ought to judge before-hand and then to
act. But you have started your work without any previous judgment and
decision. You will have to reap its fruit; there is no doubt this.

 

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

 

18\. Why are you now thinking of giving your daughter to this helpless,
wealthless Sudars’ana in the presence of kings that are powerful and
that command a great militia.

 

19\. O thou most sinful! Today I will certainly kill you; next I will
kill Sudars’ana and then give your daughter to my daughter’s son; know
that this is my firm resolve.

 

20\. Who is there, when I am standing, in this assembly that can aspire
to carry away the bridegroom elect by force or theft? Nothing to speak
of Sudars’ana who is powerless, wealthless and a mere boy!

 

21\. I spared his life before in the hermitage of Bhâradvâja at the
Muni’s request; but today I will not spare the boy under any
circumstances whatsoever.

 

22\. Therefore, please go and consult with your wife and daughter and
give your dear beautiful daughter to my daughter’s son.

 

23\. Be engaged in a marriage tie with me by giving your exquisitely
beautiful daughter to my daughter’s son. You can very well judge that it
is always proper and advisable that a great man shall come under the
protection of another great man.

 

24\. What happiness can you expect from this Sudars’ana, who is helpless
and banished from his kingdom, that you are going to give him your dear
and auspicious daughter!

 

25\. Family, wealth, army, appearance, kingdoms, forts and true friends
and other helping persons; these a man should consider when he is going
to give away his daughter in marriage to anybody; else there is no
surety of happiness. Think over the royal custom and the never failing
Dharma and do what is proper. Never it is advisable to do any act,
abandoning the path of Dharma and morals.

 

26\. You are my intimate friend; therefore I am telling you these good
words. O king! Better bring your daughter, surrounded by her attendant
maids, in this hall of Svayamvara.

 

27\. Let this daughter select any man other than Sudars’ana; I have got
no cause of quarrel; and the marriage will then be celebrated according
to your will.

 

28-29. O best of kings! The other kings are all of high descent; and
they have armies and are all in positions befitting your connection! If
the daughter chooses any one amongst them, then no quarrels would arise.
But if the daughter chooses Sudars’ana, then certainly I will carry her
by force. Therefore, O king! act in such a way that no quarrels occur in
future.”

 

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

 

30-31. Vyâsa said :-- Thus addressed by Yudhâjit, the king of Benares
was very sorrowful, and, after a heavy sigh, went to his palace and told
with a grieved heart to his wife, thus :-- “O fair eyed one! Now I am
completely under your control; you better explain to S’as’ikalâ that a
dreadful quarrel is now to occur; what am I to do now?”

 

32-33. Vyâsa said :-- Hearing her husband's words, the queen went to her
daughter and spoke thus :-- “O child! Quarrels have now ensued amongst
the kings for your sake; your father has become very sorrowful;
therefore, O fair one! Choose any other man your husband than
Sudars’ana.

 

34-35. O Child! If you do not judge and rashly choose Sudars’ana, then
the powerful king Yudhâjit, possessing a large army, will no doubt kill
you, me and Sudars’ana. It might be, if quarrels ensue, you might be
married to another husband; therefore better think now and act.

 

36\. O dear eyed! It is now your incumbent duty to choose another king
for your husband, if you want your and my welfare and happiness. Leave
Sudars’ana.”

 

37\. The mother thus advised her daughter; the king, too, afterwards
explained and tried to convince her. The girl spoke fearlessly.

 

38\. “O king! What you have said is all true; but you know my firm
resolve already. I won't ever select any other king than Sudars’ana.

 

39-40. O king! If you are afraid and be in agony, then do this thing:
better give me in marriage to Sudars’ana and then drive us away from
your city. He will put me in his chariot and go away out of your city.
After that what is inevitable will surely come to pass. There cannot be
anything otherwise.

 

41\. O king! You need not fear anything about what is kept in the womb
of future by Destiny. What is inevitable will happen; there is no doubt
in this.”

 

42\. The king said :-- “O child! The intelligent persons never show too
much rashness and insolence. The learned people, versed in the Vedas,
say it is never advisable to quarrel with many persons.

 

43\. How can I give my daughter in marriage to one and then banish them
both? The kings have turned out enemies. There is no heinous crime, that
they cannot commit now.

 

44\. O child! If it be your opinion, I can pledge something as a pawn
for your marriage, as the king Janaka pledged in days of yore for her
daughter Sitâ.

 

45-47. I will also put forward a pawn very difficult to be carried out,
as Janaka originally made an offer of the hands of Sitâ to whomsoever,
who would break the S’iva’s strong bow. Thus the quarrels amongst the
kings might

 

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

 

be diminished; for he who will be able to fulfill the promise, will be
able to accept you. Then, be he Sudars’ana or any other king, whoever
will be strong to fulfill the promise will take you as his wife.

 

48\. Thus the quarrels will cease and I will also be able to perform
your marriage ceremony in peace and happiness.”

 

49\. The daughter said :-- “Father! On hearing from you, I am merged in
an ocean of doubt, for it seems to me what you are saying is the act of
a fool; already, I have chosen in my mind Sudars’ana for my husband; now
it cannot be otherwise.

 

50\. O king! The mind is the source of virtue and vice. When I have
mentally selected, how can I now forego him and choose another?

 

51-52. O king! If you keep any pledge, then I will be subject to any and
everybody; if one, two, or more fulfill the same pledge, I will be then
subject to any or all of them. Father! in that case quarrels may arise.
What shall  I do then? I cannot give my vote on this doubtful point.

 

53\. O king! You need not fear anything. Better give me in marriage to
Sudars’ana according to the prescribed rules; then, in that case, the
Goddess Chandikâ will certainly protect us.

 

54\. O king! Taking Whose Name destroys a whole host of sins, take Her
Name and think the Almighty and perform carefully our marriage ceremony.

 

55\. Better go to the king's assembly today, and, with folded hands,
tell them come tomorrow to the hall of Svayamvara.

 

56-57. Thus bidding goodbye to the kings, perform in the right spirit,
according to the prescribed rites, our marriage ceremony. Next, after
giving fit dowries and other articles after the marriage, better tell
the prince Sudars’ana to depart. The son of Dhruvasandhi will take me
away with him.

 

58\. If, at this, the kings get angry and be ready to quarrel with you,
then in that case, the Goddess Bhagavatî will no doubt help us.

 

59\. Sudars’ana then will fight against those kings; and if he loses his
life perchance in the battle, then I will also follow him and die.

 

60\. O king! Let all good come unto you! Better give me in marriage to
Sudars’ana and remain here with your army. I will go alone with him, the
object of my love.”

 

61\. Vyâsa said :-- Hearing these words from her daughter, the king
Subâhu trusted her, and firmly resolved to act according to that, and to
celebrate the marriage of S’as’ikalâ.

 

Thus ends the 21st chapter on the king of Benares fulfilling the advice
of his daughter in S’rîmad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
