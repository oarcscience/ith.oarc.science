1-43. S’rî Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- The Brâhma<u>n</u>as that will
perform duly the S’irovrata, to be described in the following, are the
only ones who will attain very easily the highest knowledge, destroying
all Avidyâ or Ignorance. So much so that the rules of right living and
right conduct as ordained in the S’rutis and Smritis are not necessary
to be observed by those who duly and devotedly perform the S’irovrata
(i.e., vow of the head; i.e., vow to apply ashes on the forehead). O
Learned One! It is through this S’irovrata that Brahmâ and the other
Devas have been able to get their Brahmâhood and the Devahood. The
ancient sages glorified highly this S’irovrata. Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u,
Rudra and the other Devas all performed this S’irovrata. O Wise One!
Those that performed

duly this S’irovrata, all became sinless though they were sinful in
every way. Its name is S’irovrata, inasmuch as it is mentioned in the
first part of the Atharva Veda. Only this vrata (vow) is called
S'irovrata; no other thing is denominated by this name. By no other
merit can this be acquired. O Muni! Different names are assigned to this
vrata in different S’âkhâs; in fact, they are all one and the same.

 

N. B. -- Pâsupata vrata, S'ivavrata, etc., are the different names
assigned to it. In all the S’âkhâs, the One Substance, Intelligence
solidified named S'iva and the knowledge thereof is mentioned. This is
“S’irovrata.” He who does not perform this S’irovrata, is irreligious
and he is banished from all religious acts, though he is well-qualified
in all branches of learning. There is no manner of doubt in this. This
S’irovrata is like the blazing fire in destroying wholly the forest of
sins. All knowledge fleshes before him who performs this S’irovrata. The
Atharva S’ruti expounds the subtle and particularly incomprehensible
things; this S’ruti declares the above S’irovrata as daily to be done;
so it is one of the daily observances. “Fire is ashes,” “water is
ashes,” “earth is ashes,” “air is ashes,” “ether or Âkâs'a is ashes,”
“all this manifest Universe is ashes.” These six mantras stated in the
Atharva Veda are to be recited; after this, ashes are to be besmeared
all over the body. This is named the S’irovrata. The devotee is to put
on these ashes named S’irovrata during his Sandhyopâsanâ (practising
Sandhyâ thrice a day); so long as the Brahmâ Vidyâ (the knowledge of
Brahmâ) does not arise in him. One is to make a Sankalpa (resolve) of
twelve years before one starts with this Vrata. In cases of
incapability, a period of one year or six months, or three months or at
least twelve days are to be adopted. That Guru is considered very cruel
and his knowledge will come to an end who hesitates and does not impart
the knowledge of the Vedas and other things to him who is purified by
observing this S’irovrata. Know him certainly as a very merciful Guru
who illumines the heart by Brahmâ Vidyâ just as God is very merciful and
compassionate to all the living beings. One who performs one's own
Dharmas for many births, acquires particular faith in this S’irovrata;
others can have no faith in this. Rather he gets animosity for this
vrata, because of the abundance of ignorance in him. So one ought never
to advise on spiritual knowledge to an enemy who has no faith, rather
who has hatred for any such thing. Those only that are purified by the
observance of S’irovrata are entitled to Brahmâ Vidyâ; and none others.
So the Vedas command :-- Those are to be advised on Brahmâ Vidyâ who
have performed S’irovrata. Even the animal becomes freed of his
animalism, as a result of this vrata; no sin occurs in killing that
animal; this is

the decision of the Vedânta. It has been repeatedly uttered by Jâvâla
Ri<u>s</u>i that the Dharma of the Brâhma<u>n</u>as is to put on the
Tripu<u>nd</u>ra (three curved lines of ashes on the forehead). The
householders are instructed to put on this Tripu<u>nd</u>ra by repeating
the mantra “triyamvaka”' with Om prefixed. Those that are in the stage
of the Bhik<u>s</u>us (Sannyâsis, etc.,) are to put on this
Tripu<u>nd</u>ra uttering thrice the mantra “Om Hasa<u>h.</u>” Such is
regularly stated in Jâvâla S’ruti. The house holders and the
Vânaprasthis (foresters) are to put on this Tripu<u>nd</u>ra, uttering
Triyamvaka mantra purified with “Haum” the pra<u>n</u>ava of S’iva
prefixed.

 

Those that are the Brahmâchâris are to use daily this Tripu<u>nd</u>ra
uttering the mantra “Medhâvî,” etc. The Brâhma<u>n</u>as are to apply
the ashes in three curved lines on the forehead. The God S’iva is always
hidden under the cover of ashes; so the S’aivas, the devotees of S’iva
are to use the Tripu<u>nd</u>ra. The Brâhma<u>n</u>as are to use daily
this Tripu<u>nd</u>ra. Brahmâ is the Prime Brâhmi<u>n</u>. When He used
Tripu<u>nd</u>ra on His forehead, what need to tell, then, that every
Brâhma<u>n</u> ought always to use it! Never fail, out of error, to
besmear your body with the ashes as prescribed in the Vedas and worship
the S’iva Lingam. The Sannyâsins are to apply Tripu<u>nd</u>ra on their
forehead, arms, chest, uttering the Triyamvaka mantra with Om prefixed
and also the five lettered mantra of S'iva “Om Nama<u>h</u> S’ivâya.”
The Brahmâchâris should use Tripu<u>nd</u>ra of ashes, obtained from
their own fire, uttering the mantra “Triyâyu<u>s</u>am Jamadagneh,”
etc., or the mantra “Medhâvî”, etc. The S’ûdras in the service of the
Brâhmi<u>n</u>s are to use the ashes with devotion, with the mantra
“Nama<u>h</u> S’ivâya.” The other ordinary persons can use the
Tripu<u>nd</u>ra without any mantra. To besmear the body all over with
ashes and to put on the Tripu<u>nd</u>ra is the essence of all Dharma;
therefore this should be used always. The ashes from the Agnihotra
Sacrifice or from Virajâgni (Virajâ fire) are to be carefully placed on
a clean and pure basin. Cleansing hands and feet, one is to sip (perform
Âchamana) twice, and then, taking the ashes in the hand, utter the five
Brahmâ mantras “Sadyoyâtam prapadyâmi,” etc., and perform short
Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma thrice; he is, then, to utter the seven mantras “Fire
is ashes,” “water is ashes,” “earth is ashes” “Teja is ashes,” “wind is
ashes,” “ether is ashes,” “All this whatsoever is ashes” and purify and
impregnate the ashes with the mantra by blowing out air through the
mouth. Then one is to think of Mahâ Deva, repeating the mantra “Om
Apojyoti,” etc., and apply dry ashes of white colour all over the body
and become sinless. After this he is to meditate on the Mahâ
Vi<u>sn</u>u, the Lord of the universe and on the Lord of the waters and
repeat again the mantras “Fire is ashes” and mix water with the ashes.
He is, then, to think of S’iva and apply ashes on his forehead. He is to
think of the ashes as S’iva Himself and

then, with mantras appropriate to his own Âs'rama (stages of life) use
the Tripu<u>nd</u>ra on his forehead, chest and shoulders.

 

By the middle finger and ringfinger he is to draw the two lines of the
ashes from the left to the right and by his thumb draw a third line of
ashes from the right to the left. These Tripu<u>nd</u>ras are to be used
in the morning, midday and in the evening.

 

Here ends the Ninth chapter of the Eleventh Book on the rules of
S'irovrata in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000
verses by Mahâr<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
