**Chapter XXXIII**

 

**On the description of the destinies of different sinners in different
hells**

 

<span id="page_927">p. 927</span>

 

1-19. Dharmarâjan said :-- Those that are in Hari’s service, pure, the
Siddhas in Yoga (those that have attained success in Yoga), the
performers of Vratas (vows), the chaste, the ascetics, the Brahmachâris
never go to hells. There is no doubt in this. Those persons that are
proud of their strong positions and who use very harsh burning words to
their friends, they go to Vah<u>n</u>i Ku<u>nd</u>a and live there for
as many years as  there are hairs on his body; next they attain animal
births for three births and get themselves scorched under the strong
heat of the Sun. He goes to the Tapta Ku<u>nd</u>a hell who does not

 

<span id="page_928">p. 928</span>

 

entertain any Brâhma<u>n</u> guest with any eatables who comes to his
house hungry and thirsty. He lives there for as many years as there are
hairs on his body and he has to sleep on a bed of fire, very tormenting.
Then he will have to be born for seven births as birds. If anybody
washes any clothing with any salt on Sunday, or on the day of Samkrânti
(when the Sun enters another sign), or on any new-moon day or on any
S’râddha day (when funeral ceremonies are performed), he will have to go
to the K<u>s</u>âra Ku<u>nd</u>a hell where he remains for as many years
as there are threads in that clothing and finally he becomes born for
seven births as a veritable washerman. The wretch that abuses Mûla
Prakriti, the Vedas, the S’âstras, Purâ<u>n</u>as, Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u,
S’iva and the other Devas, Gaurî, Lak<u>s</u>mî, Sarasvatî and the other
Devîs, goes to the hell named Bhayânaka Narakaku<u>nd</u>a. There is no
other hell more tormenting than this. The sinners live here for many
Kalpas and ultimately become serpents. There is no sin greater than the
abuse of the Devî. There is no expiation for it. So one ought never to
abuse the Devî. If one discontinues the allowances given by oneself or
other persons to the Devas or Brâhma<u>n</u>as, one goes to
Vi<u>st</u>hâ Ku<u>nd</u>a and has to eat the faeces there for sixty
thousand years and finally to be born in Bhârata as worms in faeces the
same number of years. If any person without the owner’s permission digs
another’s tank dried of water, or makes water in the water of any tank,
he goes to Mûtra Ku<u>nd</u>a and drinks urine for as many years as
there are the particles in that tank. Then he becomes born in this
Bhârata its an ox for one hundred years. If any person eats good things
himself without giving any portion thereof to the member of his family,
he goes to S’le<u>s</u>ma Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats phlegm, for full
one hundred years. Then he becomes born as Preta (disembodied spirits)
in this Bhârata for hundred years and drinks phlegm, urine and pus; then
he becomes pure. He who does not support his father, mother, spiritual
teacher, wife, sons, daughters and the helpless persons, goes to Gara
Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats poison for full one hundred years. Finally he
becomes born and wanders as Bhûtas (disembodied spirits). Then he
becomes pure.

 

20-50. He who becomes angry and shrinks his eyes at the sight of a guest
who has come to his house offends the Devas or Pitris, who do not accept
the water offered to them by that villain. On the contrary, he earns all
the sins of Brahmahatyâ (murder of a Brâhmi<u>n</u> and so forth) and
finally goes to Dû<u>s</u>ikâku<u>nd</u>a where he remains for one
hundred years and eats polluted things. Then wandering as Bhûtas for one
hundred years he becomes purified. If anybody makes a gift of any
article to a Brâhmi<u>n</u> and then again gives that article to a
different man, he goes to Vasâ Kun<u>da</u>

<u> </u>

<span id="page_929">p. 929</span>

 

where he eats marrows for one hundred years. Then he has to roam about
in India for seven births as a Krikalâsa (lizard) and finally he becomes
born as a very poor man with a very short life. If any woman or any man
makes another of a different sex eat semen, out of passion, he goes to
S’ukra Ku<u>nd</u>a where he drinks semen for one hundred years. Then he
crawls about as worms for one hundred years. And then he gets purified.
If anybody beats a Brâhma<u>n</u>a who is a family preceptor and causes
his blood to come out, he will have to go to Rakta Ku<u>nd</u>a where he
has to drink blood for one hundred years. Finally he has to roam about
for seven births in India as tigers; then he becomes pure by degrees. If
anybody mocks and laughs at any devotee of Kri<u>sn</u>a who sings with
rapt consciousness and sheds tears of joy, he will have to go to As’ru
Ku<u>nd</u>a where he drinks tears for one hundred years. Then he has to
roam as Châ<u>nd</u>âla for three births and then he becomes pure. He
who always cheats his friends, lives for one hundred years in Gâtramala
Ku<u>nd</u>a. Then roaming about for three births as an ass and for
three births as a fox concurrently, he becomes purified. Out of vanity,
if anybody jests at a deaf person, he goes to
Kar<u>n</u>amalaku<u>nd</u>a where he eats for one hundred years the wax
of the ear. Next he comes to the earth as a deaf and very poor man for
seven births, when at last he gets purified. If anybody commits murder
out of greed to support his family, he goes to the hell
Majjâku<u>nd</u>a where he eats marrow for one lakh years. Next he
becomes a fish for seven births, for seven births he becomes a mosquito,
for three births he becomes a boar, for seven births he becomes a cock,
deer and other animals concurrently; at last he gets purified. If any
stupid person sells the daughter whom he has supported, out of greed for
money, he goes to Mâ<u>n</u>saku<u>nd</u>a and lives there for as many
years as there are hairs on her body. The Yama’s servants beat him with
their clubs. His head becomes overloaded with the burden of the flesh;
and, out of hunger, he licks the blood coming out of his head. Next that
sinner comes to Bhârata and for sixty years becomes a worm in any
daughter’s faeces, for seven births he becomes a hunter; for three
births, a boar; for seven births, cock; for seven births, frog; for
seven births, leech; and for seven births, crow; when he gets purified.
One who shaves on the day of observing vows, fasting and funeral
ceremony day, becomes impure and unfit to do any action, and, in the
end, he goes to the Nakha Ku<u>nd</u>a where he receives blows of clubs
and eats nails for one hundred Deva years. If anybody worships, out of
carelessness, the earthen S’iva phallic symbol with any hairs on it, he
goes to the hell Kes’a Ku<u>nd</u>a where he remains for as many years
as there are particles in that hair; then he gets to the yoni (womb) a
Yâvanânî (a Mlechcha woman) out of Hara’s wrath. After one hundred

 

<span id="page_930">p. 930</span>

 

years he becomes freed from that and then he becomes a Râk<u>s</u>asa;
there is no doubt in this. He who does not offer Pi<u>nd</u>as to the
Vi<u>sn</u>upâda in honour of his Pitris at Gayâ goes to the hell
Asthiku<u>nd</u>a where he remains for as many years as there are dirts
on his body. Then he becomes a man; but for seven births he becomes lame
and poor. Then he gets purified. The stupid man who commits outrage and
violence on his pregnant wife, resides for one hundred years in the hot
Tâmra Ku<u>nd</u>a (where coppers are in a molten condition). He who
takes the food of a childless widow and the same of any woman that has
just bathed after menstruation goes for one hundred years to the hot
Lauha Ku<u>nd</u>a (where iron is in a molten condition). For seven
births he becomes then a crow and for seven births he becomes born of a
washerwoman, full of sores and boils, and poor. Then he gets purified.

 

51-61. If one touches the things of the Devas after touching skins or
impure hides, one remains in the Charma Ku<u>nd</u>a for full one
hundred years. If any Brâhmi<u>n</u> eats a S’ûdra’s food, requested by
him, he lives for one hundred years in the hot Surâ Ku<u>nd</u>a. Then
for seven births he performs, the funeral rites for a S’ûdra; at last he
becomes pure. If any foul-mouthed person uses always harsh and filthy
language to his master, he will have to go to Tîk<u>sn</u>a
Kan<u>t</u>aka Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats thorns. Besides, the Yama’s
servants give severe beatings to him with their clubs. For seven births
he will have to become horses when he gets purified. If any man
ministers poison to another and so takes away his life, he will have to
remain for endless years in Vi<u>s</u>aku<u>nd</u>a, where he will have
to eat poison. Then he will have to pass for one hundred years as a
murderer Bhilla, full of sores and boils, and for seven births he will
have to be a leper when at last he gets purified. Being born in this
holy land Bhâratavar<u>s</u>a, if any man strikes a cow with a rod or
any driver does so whether by himself or by his servant, he will have to
dwell certainly in the hot Lauha Ku<u>nd</u>a for four yugas. He will
have to pass as many years as a cow as there are hairs on that cow when
ultimately he gets purified. If anybody strikes any other body with a
red-hot iron dart (Kunta weapon), he will have to dwell in the Kunta
Ku<u>nd</u>a for ayuta years. Then he will have to remain for one birth
in a good womb, with a diseased constitution, when ultimately he will be
purified.

 

62-85. If any Brâhmi<u>n</u> villain eats, out of greed, any flesh (not
sacrificed before the goddess) or anything not offered to Hari, he will
have to remain in the Krimi Ku<u>nd</u>a where he eats those things for
as many years as there are hairs on his body. Then he will have to pass
for three births as Mlechchas when ultimately he becomes born in a
Brâhmi<u>n</u>

 

<span id="page_931">p. 931</span>

 

family. If any Brâhmi<u>n</u> performs the S’râdh of a S’ûdra, eats the
food pertaining to a S’râdh of a S’ûdra or burns the dead body of a
S’ûdra, he will have to dwell certainly in Pûya Ku<u>nd</u>a, where,
being beaten by the rod of Yama, he eats the pus, etc., for as many
years as there are hairs on his body. Then he becomes reborn in this
Bhârata as one greatly diseased, poor, deaf and dumb and ultimately he
will have to roam for seven births as a S’ûdra. He who kills a black
serpent on whose hood there is the lotus mark, lives in Sarpa
Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs on his body and he is
bitten by serpents there and beaten by the servants of Yama and eats the
excrescences of snakes and finally becomes born as a serpent. Then he
becomes a man shortlived and having the cuticaneous disease and
ringworm. And his death also comes out of snake-bite. He who kills
mosquitoes and other small fanged-animals, that earn their substance
rightly and pass so their lives, goes to Dams’a mas’a Ku<u>nd</u>a where
he is eaten by mosquitoes and other fanged-creatures and lives there
without food and crying, weeping, for as many years as the numbers of
lives destroyed. Besides the Yama’s servants tie his hands and feet and
beat him. Then he becomes born as flies when ultimately he becomes
purified. He who beats and chastises any man not fit to be chastised and
beaten and as well as a Brâhma<u>n</u>a, goes to Vajra Dam<u>st</u>ra
Ku<u>nd</u>a, full of worms, and lives there day and night for as many
years as there are the number of hairs on the chastised person. When he
is bitten by the worms and beaten by Yama’s servants, he cries
sometimes, weeps sometimes, and becomes very miserable. Next he is
reborn as a crow for seven births when ultimately he gets purified. If
any foolish king punishes and gives trouble to his subjects out of greed
of money, he goes to Vri<u>s</u>chika Ku<u>nd</u>a where he lives for as
many years as there are hairs on the bodies of his subjects. There is no
doubt in this. Finally he becomes born in this Bhârata as a scorpion;
then a man diseased and defective in limbs, when ultimately he becomes
freed of his sins. If any Brâhmi<u>n</u> carries or raises weapons,
washes the clothes of others who do not perform Sandhyâs and abandons
his devotion to Hari, he lives in Sarâdi Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years
as there are hairs on his body; he is, then, pierced by arrows. Finally
he becomes purified. If any king maddened by his own folly and fault,
shuts his subjects in a dark cell and kills them, then he will have to
go to a dreadful dark hell filled with worms having fanged teeth and
covered with dirt. This hell is named Gola Ku<u>nd</u>a. He lives there
bitten by insects for as many years as there are hairs on the bodies of
his subjects. Finally he becomes a slave of those subjects, when he gets
purified.

 

86-103. If anybody kills the sharks and crocodiles, etc., that rise out
of the water spontaneously, he will have to remain, then, in Nakra

 

<span id="page_932">p. 932</span>

 

Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are thorns or edged points on
those animals. Then he will have to be born as crocodiles, etc., for
some time, when he will be purified. If any man, overpowered with lust,
sees another’s wife’s uncovered breast, loins, and face, he will have to
remain in Kâka Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs in his
own body. Here the crows take out his eyes. Finally for three births he
gets himself burned by Fire when he becomes pure. He who steals in India
the gold of the Devas and the Brâhma<u>n</u>as, dwells certainly in
Manthâna Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs on his body.
My servants give him good beatings, and cudgellings; his eyes are
covered by Manthâna Danda insects (or animals) and he eats their dirty
faeces. Then he is reborn as a man but for three births he becomes blind
and for seven births he becomes very poor, cruel, and a sinful goldsmith
and then he is born a Svar<u>n</u>ava<u>n</u>ik (Sonâr bene). O Fair
One! He who steals in India copper or iron, silver or gold, dwells in
Vîja Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs on his body.
There the Vîjas (a kind of insect) cover his eyes and he eats the
excrescences of those insects. My messengers torment him. Finally he
gets purified. If anybody steals in India any Devatâ or the articles of
a Devatâ, he dwells in Vajra Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are
hairs on his body. There his body gets burnt up. My messengers torment
him and he a cries and weeps and remains without any food. Then he gets
purified. If anybody steals the metal gold or silver, cows, or garments
of any Deva or a Brâhma<u>n</u>a, certainly he dwells in hot
Pâ<u>s</u>â<u>n</u>a Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs
on his body. Next for three births he becomes a tortoise and all sorts
of white birds. Finally for three births he becomes a leper and for one
birth be becomes a man with white marks on his body. Next for seven
births he becomes diseased with a severe colic pain and bad blood and
lives short. Then he gets purified. If anybody steals brass or Kâmsya
properties of any Deva or a Brâhma<u>n</u>a, he will have to remain in
the sharp Pâ<u>s</u>â<u>n</u>a Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there
are hairs on his body. Next he becomes born in Bhârata for seven births
as horses; and ultimately his both the testicles get enlarged and he
gets diseases in his legs when he gets purified. If anybody verily eats
the food of an adulterate woman or lives on her alms, he will have to go
to the Lâlâ Ku<u>nd</u>a for as many years as there are hairs on his
body. My messengers torment him there and he eats the saliva and thus
lives miserably. Then he gets eye diseases and colic; when ultimately he
gets purified.

 

104-126. If any Brâhma<u>n</u>a lives on writing only or on the service
of Mlechchas, he lives in Masi Ku<u>nd</u>a very painfully, eating ink,
tormented by My messengers for as many years as there are hairs

 

<span id="page_933">p. 933</span>

 

on his body. Then he becomes a black animal for three births and for
another three births he becomes a black goat. Then he becomes a Tâl tree
when he gets purified. If anybody steals a Deva’s or

a Brâhma<u>n</u>a’s grains, or any other good materials, betel, Âsan
(seat) or bedding, he lives in Chûr<u>n</u>a Ku<u>nd</u>a for one
hundred years, tormented by My Dûtas (messengers). Next for three births
he gets

himself born as a goat, cock, and monkey. Finally he becomes born as a
man with the heart disease, without any issue, poor, and short lived.
When, at last, he gets purified. If anybody steals any Brâhmi<u>n’</u>s
property and thereby does chakra pûjâ (the famous chakra circle worship
in Tantra), or prepares a potter’s wheel or any other wheels, he will
have to go to Chakra Ku<u>nd</u>a and remain there for one hundred
years, tormented by My messengers. Then he will be born for three births
as an oilman suffering from very severe diseases when he will ultimately
be poor, without any issue and diseased. Finally he gets purified. If
anybody casts a sinful eye on any Brâhma<u>n</u>a or on cows, he will
have to remain in Vakra Ku<u>nd</u>a for one hundred Yugas. Next for
three births he becomes a cat, for three births he becomes a vulture;
for three births he becomes a boar; for three births he becomes a
peacock; for seven births he becomes a man deformed and defective in
limbs, his wife being dead, without any issue. Finally he becomes
purified. If any person born in a Brâhmi<u>n</u> family eats the flesh
of a tortoise that is prohibited, he lives in Kûrma Ku<u>nd</u>a, for
one hundred years, eaten by tortoises. Then he becomes for three births
a tortoise; for three births, a boar; for three births a cat; for three
births, a peacock; till at last he gets purified. If anybody steals
clarified butter or oil of any Devas or a Brâhma<u>n</u>a he will have
to go to Jvâlâ Ku<u>nd</u>a or Bha<u>s</u>ma Ku<u>nd</u>a. That sinner
remains in oil for one hundred years and gets soaked through and
through. Then for seven births he becomes a fish and a mouse when he
gets purified. If anybody, born here in this holy land Bhârata steals
sweet scented oil of a Deva or of a Brâhma<u>n</u>a, the powdered
myrobalan or any other scent, he goes to Dagdha Ku<u>nd</u>a where he
lives, burnt day and night for as many years as there are hairs on his
body. For seven births he becomes born emitting a nasty smell, for three
births he becomes musk (mriga-nâbhi); for seven births, as a Manthâna
insect. Then he becomes born as a man. If, out of envy, a powerful man
appropriates to his purpose another’s ancestral property by cheating, by
using force, he goes to the hot Sûchî Ku<u>nd</u>a, being tormented
there like a Jîva dropped in the midst of a very hot oil tank, full of
boiling oil. His body is, then, being burnt up severely as the

 

<span id="page_934">p. 934</span>

 

result of his own Karma; the wonder being that his body never gets
completely destroyed nor reduced to ashes. For seven manvantaras he
lives there without any food. My messengers give him good beatings and
cudgellings and chastise him; he cries aloud. Next he gets himself born
as worms of faeces for sixty thousand years. When he becomes born as a
pauper without owning any land. Thus that villain, getting a fresh lease
of human birth, begins again to do fresh good acts.

 

Here ends the Thirty-third Chapter of the Ninth Book on the description
of the destinies of different sinners in different hells in S’rî Mad
Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000  verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
