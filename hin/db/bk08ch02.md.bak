1-10. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Child! When you have got your senses
controlled and have overcome lust, anger, etc., and other enemies, then
you are certainly entitled to hear this secret. While Brahmâ was
discussing on this subject with Marîchi and the other Brahmâr<u>s</u>is
and with Svâyambhuva Manu, suddenly there came out of the nose of the
meditative Brahmâ, one young boar (the child of a boar) of the dimension
of one finger only. That little boar, that was just in the air, soon
became, while they were looking at it, enlarged to a very big elephant,
in an instant; a very strange sight, indeed! Seeing this, the Kumâras
Sanaka, etc., Marîchi and the other Seven Ri<u>s</u>is, and the Creator
Brahmâ were struck with wonder and Brahmâ began to discuss thus :-- Oh!
This young boar has come out suddenly of My nose; though it is a very
small one, it is certainly, come under a disguise and it has all made us
merge

in an ocean of wonder. Is this something Divine, of a Sâttvic quality
under the guise of this boar? It was of the size of a thumb and it is
now like the Himâlayâ Mountain? Oh! Is this the Bhagavân, the Yajña
Puru<u>s</u>a? While they were thus discussing, the Bhagavân, in the
shape of the boar, began to make loud sounds, like the rolling of the
mountain clouds at the time of the Pralaya resounding all the quarters.
At this Brahmâ and all the Ri<u>s</u>is assembled there became very
glad. Hearing the ghurghura noise of the Boar, their troubles ended and
the people of Janarloka, Taparloka, Satyaloka and all the Devas being
very much gladdened began to chant sweet hymns with Chha<u>n</u>das of
Rik, Yajus, Sâma and Atharva Vedas, to that Âdi Puru<u>s</u>a, the
Bhagavân, from all sides.

 

11-20. Hearing their praises, the Bhagavân Hari graciously looked on
them and immediately merged Himself in the ocean. The ocean was very
much agitated with the fierce striking of the hairs of the Boar, when He
entered into the waters, and spoke thus :-- “O Deva ! O Thou, the
destroyer of the afflictions of your refuges! Protect me.” Hearing the
words of the ocean, the God Hari tore asunder all the aquatic animals
and went down beneath the waters. Searching violently hither and
thither, He knew the earth by her smell. At once the Bhagavân Hari, the
Lord of all, went to Her and rescued the earth by raising Her up on his
big teeth, the Earth that was the abode of all the beings. When the
Bhagavân, the Lord of all the sacrifices, came up with the Earth on the
top of His teeth, He looked beautiful like the elephant of a quarter
taking out by the root and holding a thousand petalled lotus upon his
tusks. When the Bhagavân rescued thus the Earth, raising Her up on His
tusks, Brahmâ and Indra, the Lord of the Devas, the powerful Manu began
praise to Him with sweet words :-- Brahmâ said :-- O Lotus-eyed! O
Bhagavân! Thou art victorious everywhere; O Thou, the Destroyer of the
sufferings of the Bhaktas! Thou hast, by Thy own prowess, humiliated the
Heaven, the abode of the gods upto Satyaloka! Thou, the Giver all the
desires! O Deva! This earth shines so beautiful on Thy teeth as the
thousand petalled lotus, taken up by the root by a mad elephant, shines
on his two tusks. O Bhagavân! This Form, i. e., that of Thy sacrificial
Boar, with earth on Thee looks so very beautiful as the lotus looks
beautiful on the tusks of an elephant.

 

21-22. O Lord! We bow down to Thee, the Creator and the Destroyer of
everything; Thou assumest many forms for the purpose of destroying the
Dânavas; Thou dost do many acts that redound to Thy Glory, We bow down
to Thee, to Thy Front and to Thy Back. (Really thou hast no front nor
back. Thou art everywhere.) Thou art the Upholder of all the Celestials
and the Immortals! Thy eyes shine equally everywhere.

23-25. O Deva! By Thy power I am brought up and engaged in the work of
creation and by Thy order I create in every Kalpa this Universe and
destroy it. O Lord of Immortals! In the ancient times the Devas united
churned the vast ocean by Thy help and got according to their merits
their due shares. O Hari! Indra, the Lord of the Devas is enjoying the
vast kingdom of Heaven, the Trilokas, by Thy Will and appointment. All
the Devas worship him.

 

26-27. So the God of Fire has got his burning power and is residing in
the bellies of the Devas, the Asuras, men and all other beings and
penetrating their bellies, is satisfying all. Yama, the King of Dharma,
by Thy appointment, is the Lord of the southern quarters, is presiding
over the Pitris and being the witness of all the actions of the Jivâs,
is awarding duly to them the fruits thereof.

 

28-33. Nai<u>rr</u>ita, the Lord of the Rak<u>s</u>asas, the witness of
all the actions of all the beings, by Thy commandment, is the destroyer
of all the obstacles of the devotees that take refuge unto thee, though
he is a Yak<u>s</u>a. The Varu<u>n</u>a Deva, by Thy order, has become
duly the Lord of the waters, and the Regent of the Loka (Dikpâla). The
Vâyu, the Life of all, the carrier of the smell, has become by Thy order
Lokâpâla and the Guru of the universe. Kuvera, obedient to Thy order,
has become the Lord of the Yak<u>s</u>as and the Kinnaras and is holding
a respectful position like other Lokapâlas. Îs'âna, Who is the destroyer
of all the Jîvas, has got his Lordship over a quarter by Thy order and
is being praised by all the Rudras, the Devas, Gandharbas,
Yak<u>s</u>as, Kinnaras, the men and all the beings. O Bhagavân! We bow
down to Thee, the Lord of the Universe; the innumerable Devas that are
seen are merely the small fractions of Thy powers.

 

34-38. Naraya<u>n</u>a said :-- “O Child Nârada! When Brahmâ, the
Creator and the Grandsire of the Lokas, praised thus the Âdi
Puru<u>s</u>a Bhagavân, He cast a side long glance at them, offering His
Grace. When the Bhagavân, the Sacrificial Boar, was coming up with
earth, rescued and placed on his teeth, the awful Hira<u>n</u>yaksa, the
chief of the Daityas came before Him and obstructed His passage when He
killed him by one violent stroke of his club. He was besmeared all over
his body with the blood of the Daitya; and thus He came up from the
Rasâtala and placed the earth on the waters. He then went away to His
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha abode.

 

O Child Nârada! He who hears or reads devotedly this glorious deed of
the Bhagavân and the deliverance of the Earth, will certainly be freed
of all his sins and goes to the highest holiest place of Vi<u>sn</u>u,
the Lord of all. There is no doubt in this.”

 

Here ends the Second Chapter of the Eighth Book on the uplifting of the
Earth by the Sacrificial Boar in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S'rî Mad Devî
Bhâgavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
