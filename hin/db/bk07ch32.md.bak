### On Self-realization, Spoken by the World Mother

1-50. The Devî said :-- "Hear, Ye Immortals! My words with attention,
that I am now going to speak to you, hearing which will enable the Jîvas
to realise My Essence. Before the creation, I, only I, existed; nothing
else was existent then. My Real Self is known by the names Chit, Sambit
(Intelligence), Para Brahma and others. My Âtman is beyond mind, beyond
thought, beyond any name or mark, without any parallel, and beyond
birth, death or any other change or transformation. My Self has one
inherent power called Mâyâ. This Mâyâ is not existent, nor non-existent,
nor can it be called both. This unspeakable substance Mâyâ always exists
(till the final emancipation or Mok<u>s</u>a).

Mâyâ can be destroyed by Brahma Jñâna; so it can not be called existent,
again if Mâyâ does not exist, the practical world cannot exist. So it
cannot be called non-existent. Of course it cannot be called both, for
it would involve contradictions. This Mâyâ (without beginning but with
end at the time of Mok<u>s</u>a) naturally arises as heat comes out of
fire, as the rays come out of the Sun and as the cooling rays come out
of the Moon. Just as all the Karmas of the Jîvas dissolve in deep sleep
(S'u<u>s</u>upti), so at the time of Pralaya or the General Dissolution,
the Karmas of the Jîvas, the Jîvas and Time all become merged, in one
uniform mass in this great Mâyâ. United with My S'aktî, I am the Cause
of this world; this S'aktî has this defect that it has the power of
hiding Me, its Originator.

I am Nirgu<u>n</u>a. And when I am united with my S'aktî, Mâyâ, 1 become
Saguna, the Great Cause of this world. This Mâyâ is divided into two,
Vidyâ and Avidyâ. Avidyâ Mâyâ hides Me; whereas Vidyâ Mâyâ does not.
Avidyâ creates whereas Vidyâ Mâyâ liberates.

Mâyâ united with Chaitanya (Intelligence), *i. e.*, Chidâbhâsa is the
efficient cause of this Universe; whereas Mâyâ reduced to and united
with five original elements is the material Cause of the Universe. Some
call this Mâyâ tapas; some call Her inert, material; some call Her
knowledge; some call Her Mâyâ, Pradhâna, Prak<u>r</u>iti, Ajâ (unborn)
and some others call Her S'aktî. The S'aiva authors call Her Vimars'a
and the other Vedântists call Her Avidyâ; in short, this Mâyâ is in the
heads of all the Pundits. This Mâyâ is called various in the Nigamas.

<span id="page_708">p. 708</span>

That which is seen is inert; for this reason Mâyâ is Ja<u>d</u>a (inert)
and as the knowledge it conveys is destroyed, it is false. Chaitanya
(Intelligence) is not seen; if It were seen, it would have been
Ja<u>d</u>a. Chaitanya is self-luminous; not illumined by any other
source. Were It so, Its Enlightener would have to be illumined by some
other thing and so the fallacy of Anavasthâ creeps in (an endless series
of causes and effects). Again one thing cannot be the actor and the
thing, acted upon (being contrary to each other); so Chaitanya cannot be
illumined by itself. So It is Self-luminous; and it illumines Sun, Moon,
etc., as a lamp is self-luminous and illumines other objects. So, O
Mountain! This My Intelligence is established as eternal and
everlasting. The waking, dreaming and deep sleep states do not remain
constant but the sense of "I" remains the same, whether in waking,
dreaming or deep sleep state; its anomaly is never felt. (The Bauddhas
say that) The sense of intelligence, Jñâna, is also not felt; there is
the absence of it; so what is existent is also temporarily existent. But
(it can then be argued that) then the Witness by which that absence is
sensed, that Intelligence, in the shape of the Witness, is eternal. So
the Pundits of all the reasonable S'âstras declare that Samvit
(Intelligence) is Eternal and it is Blissful the fountain of all love.
Never the Jîvas or embodied souls feel "I am not"; but "I am" this
feeling is deeply established in the soul as Love. Thus it is clearly
evident that I am quite separate from anything else which are all false.
Also I am one continuous (no interval or separation existing within Me).
Again Jñâna is not the Dharma (the natural quality) of Âtman but it is
of the very nature of Âtman. If Jñâna ware the Dharma of Âtman, then
Jñâna would have been material; so Jñâna is immaterial. If (for
argument's sake) Jñâna be denominated as material, that cannot be. For
Jñâna is of the nature of Intelligence and Âtman is of the the nature of
Intelligence. Intelligence has not the attribute of being Dharma. Here
the thing Chit is not different from its quality (Chit). So Âtman is
always of the nature of Jñâna and happiness; Its nature is Truth; It is
always Full, unattached and void of duality. This Âtman again, united
with Mâyâ, composed of desires and Karmas, wants to create, due to the
want of discrimination, the twenty-four tattvas, according to the
previous Samskâras (tendencies), time and Karma. O Mountain! The
re-awakening after Pralaya Su<u>s</u>upti is not done with Buddhi (for
then Buddhi is not at all manifested). So this creation is said to be
effected without any Buddhi (proper intelligence). O Chief of the
Immovables! The Tattva (Reality) that I have spoken to you is most
excellent and it is my Extraordinary Form merely. In the Vedas it is
known as Avyâkrita (unmodified), Avyakta (unmanifested)

<span id="page_709">p. 709</span>

Mâyâ S'abala (divided into various parts) and so forth. In all the
S'âstras, it is stated to be the Cause of all causes, the Primeval
Tattva and Sachchidânanda Vigraha. Where all the Karmas are solidified
and where Ichchâ S'aktî (will), Jñâna S'aktî (intelligence) and Kriyâ
S'aktî (action) all are melted in one, that is called the Mantra Hrîm,
that is the first Tattva. From this comes out Âkâsa, having the property
of sound, thence Vâyu (air) with "touch" property; then fire with form,
then water having "Rasa" property; and lastly the earth having the
quality "smell." The Pundits say that the "sound" is the only quality of
Âkâsa; air has two qualities *viz*., sound and touch, fire has three
qualities sound, touch, form; water has four qualities sound, touch,
form, taste; and the earth has five qualities sound, touch, form, taste
and smell. Out of these five original elements, the allpervading, Sûtra
(string or thread) arose. This Sûtrâtman (soul) is called the "Linga
Deha," comprising within itself all the Prâ<u>n</u>as; this is the
subtle body of the Paramâtman. And what is said in the previous lines as
Avyakta or Unmanifested and in which the Seed of the World is involved
and whence the Linga Deha has sprung, that is called the Causal body
(Kâra<u>n</u>a body) of the Paramâtman. The five original elements
(Apañchikrita called the five Tan Mâtrâs) being created, next by the
Pañchîkara<u>n</u>a process, the gross elements are created. The process
is now being stated :-- O Girijâ! Each of the five original elements is
divided into two parts; one part of each of which is subdivided into
four parts. This fourth part of each is united with the half of four
other elements different from it and thus each gross element is formed.
By these five gross elements, the Cosmic (Virâ<u>t</u>) body is formed
and this is called the Gross Body of the God. Jñânendriyas (the organs
of knowledge) arise from Sattva Gu<u>n</u>as of each of these five
elements. Again the Sattva Gu<u>n</u>as of each of the Jñânendriyas
united become the Anta<u>h</u> Kara<u>n</u>âni. This Anta<u>h</u>
kara<u>n</u>a is of four kinds, according as its functions vary. When it
is engaged in forming Sankalpas, resolves, and Vikalpas (doubts) it is
called "mind." When it is free from doubts and when it arrives at the
decisive conclusion, it is called "Chitta"; and when it rests simply on
itself in the shape of the feeling "I", it is called Ahamkâra. From the
Rajo Gu<u>n</u>a of each of the five elements arises Vâk (speech),
Pâ<u>n</u>i (hands) Pâda (feet), Pâyu (Anus) and Upastha (organs of
generation). Again their Rajo parts united give rise to the five
Prâ<u>n</u>as (Prâ<u>n</u>a, Apâna, Samâna, Udâna and Vyâna) the
Prâ<u>n</u>a Vayu resides in the heart; Apâna Vayu in the Arms; Samâna
Vayu resides in the Navel; Udâna Vayu rasides in the Throat; and the
Vyâna Vâyu resides, pervading all over the body. My subtle body (Linga
Deha) arises from the union of the five

<span id="page_710">p. 710</span>

Jñânendriyas, the five Karmendriyas (organs of action), the five
Pra<u>n</u>as and the mind and Buddhi, these seventeen elements. And the
Prak<u>r</u>iti that resides there is divided into two parts; one is
pure (Suddha Sattva) Mâyâ and the other is the impure Mâyâ or Avidyâ
united with the Gu<u>n</u>as. By Mâyâ is meant She, who, without
concealing Her refugees, protects them. When the Supreme Self is
reflected on this S'uddha Sattva, Mâyâ, He is called Îs'vara. This
Suddha Mâyâ does not conceal Brahma, its receptacle; therefore She knows
the All-pervading Brahma and She is omniscient, omnipotent, the Lady of
all and confers favours and blessings on all. When the Supreme Self is
reflected on the Impure Mâyâ or Avidyâ, He is called Jîva. This Avidyâ
conceals Brahma, Whose nature is Happiness; therefore this Jîva is the
source of all miseries. Both Îs'vara and Jîva have, by the influence of
Vidyâ and Avidyâ three bodies and three names. When the Jîva lives in
his causal body, he is named Prâjña; when he lives in subtle body he is
known as Taijasa; while he has the gross body, he is called Vis'va. So
when Îs'vara is in His causal body, he is denominated Îs'a; when He is
in His subtle body, he is known as Sûtra; and when He is in His gross
body, He is known as Virâ<u>t</u>.

The Jîva glories in having three (as above-mentioned) kinds of
differentiated bodies and Îs'vara glories in having three (as
above-mentioned) kinds of cosmic bodies. Thus Îs'vara is the Lord of all
and though He feels Himself always happy and satisfied, yet to favour
the Jîvas and to give them liberation (Mok<u>s</u>a) He has created
various sorts of worldly things for their Bhogas (enjoyments). This
Îs'vara creates all the Universe, impelled by My Brahma S'aktî. I am of
the nature of Brahma; and Îs'vara is conceived in Me as a snake is
imagined in a rope. Therefore Îs'vara has to remain dependent on My
S'akti.

Here ends the Thirty-second Chapter of the Seventh Book on
Self-realization, spoken by the World Mother in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am
S'rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda
Vyâsa.
