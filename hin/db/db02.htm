<p>What is S&#146;r&icirc;mad Bh&acirc;gavat is to the Vai<u>sn</u>avas, the Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam is to the S&#146;&acirc;ktas. The question of the priority of the two Bh&acirc;gavatas has been often discussed more in the spirit of partisans rather than that of sober scholars. We reserve our opinion on the subject till the publication of the complete translation of this work.</p>   
<p>This translation has been inscribed to the sacred memory of my friend the late R&acirc;i B&acirc;h&acirc;dur S&#146;r&icirc;s&#146; Chandra Vidy&acirc;r<u>n</u>ava who induced me to undertake the translation of this work. He had thoroughly read the two Bh&acirc;gavatas and it was his opinion that the priority of composition belonged to the Dev&icirc; Bh&acirc;gavatam. The other Bh&acirc;gavat, according to him, is a modern compilation attributed to Bopadeva &#150; the author of Mugdhabodha Vy&acirc;kara<u>n</u>am.</p>
