1-26. Sûta said :-- Seeing the two Dânavas very powerful, Brahmâ, the
knower of all the S’âstras, thought of the means Sâma, Dâna, Bheda,
Dan<u>d</u>a (conciliation, gifts, bribe, or sowing dissensions and war
or punishment); which of these four he should apply. He thought thus :--
“I do not know their strength and it is not advisable to enter into war
without knowing their strength. Again if I offer praises to them puffed
up with pride, it will be simply displaying my own weakness; and when
they will come to know this, only one of them will be sufficient to kill
me and this they will do certainly. To offer bribes is not also
advisable; and how can I sow dissensions. Therefore it is best that I
should rouse the four armed Janârdana Vi<u>sn</u>u, who is very
powerful, from his sleep on the thousand headed Ananta serpent. He will
remove my difficulties”.

 

Thus thinking in his mind, Bhagavân Brahmâ, the lotus-born remained in
the tubular stalk of the lotus from Vi<u>sn</u>u's navel and thence took
refuge mentally of Vi<u>sn</u>u, the remover of difficulties and began
to chant auspicious hymns composed of various metres to Jagannâth
Nârâyana, involved in deep Yoganidrâ (meditative sleep). He said :-- “O
Refuge of the poor! O Hari! O Vi<u>sn</u>u! O Vâmana! O Mâdhava, Thou
art the Lord of the universe and omnipresent. O Hrisikes'a! Thou
removest all the difficulties of Thy devotees; therefore leave your
Yoganidrâ and get up. O Vâsudeva! O Lord of the Universe! Thou residest
within the hearts of all and knowest their desires.

 

O Thou, holder of the disc and club! Thou always destroyest the enemies
of Thy devotees; O Omniscient One! Thou art the Lord of all the Lokas
and all-powerful; no one can know what is Thy form; O Lord of the Devas!
Thou art the destroyer of all pains and sufferings! So get up and
protect me. O Protector of the Universe! nothing is concealed from Thy
eyes! Every one becomes pure by hearing and chanting Thy name. Thou art
Nirâkâra (without any form); yet Thou createst, preservest and
destroyest the Universe. O Cause of the world! O Supporter of all! Thou
art shining as king of kings over all and yet Thou dost not understand
that the two Dânavas, puffed

up with pride have become ready to kill me. If thou dost neglect me,
seeing me very much distressed and under your protection then Thy name
as Preserver will become quite useless. Thus praised, when Vi<u>sn</u>u
did not get up, Brahmâ thought that "Bhagavân Vi<u>sn</u>u is now surely
under the influence of sleep of the Primal Force Âdyâ S’akti and is not
therefore getting up; what am I to do now, thus distressed! These two
Dânavas, elated with pride are ready to kill me; now what am I to do and
where shall I go? I don't find any body who can protect me any where.”
Thus thinking, Brahmâ came to the conclusion and decided to chant hymns
to Yoga Nidrâ Herself with one pointed heart. Discussing in his mind, He
thought that that Âdyâ S’akti (the Prime Force) which kept Bhagavân
Vi<u>sn</u>u, senseless and motionless would alone be able to save him.
As a dead man cannot hear any sound so Hari, merged in deep sleep, knows
not anything. When I have praised Him so much and when He has not
awakened, then it is certain that sleep is not under Hari, but Hari is
under sleep, and he who is under another becomes his slave; so this Yoga
Nidrâ is now exercising Her control over Hari. Again she, too, who
brought Hari under control, that daughter of the Kr<u>sî</u>ra (milk)
ocean is now under the control of Yoga Nidrâ; so it seems that that
Bhagavatî Mahâmâyâ has brought the whole Universe under Her control.

 

Whether it be Myself, or Vi<u>sn</u>u or S’ambhu, or Sâvitrî or Ramâ or
Umâ, all are under Her control; there is nothing to be doubted here?
What to speak of other high souled persons! Now I will chant hymns to
Yoga Nidrâ, under whose influence Bhagavân Hari even is lying, under
deep sleep, inert like an ordinary man. When the eternal Vâsudeva
Janârdana will be dispossessed by Her, He will no doubt fight with the
Dânavas. Thus deciding, Bhagavân Brahmâ, seated on the tubular stalk of
the lotus, began to chant hymns to Yoga Nidrâ, residing on the body of
Vi<u>sn</u>u, thus :--

 

27-32. Brahmâ said :-- “O Devî! I have come to understand on the
authority of all the words of the Vedas, that Thou art the only One
Cause of this Universal Brahmânda. The more so when Thou hast brought
the best Puru<u>s</u>a Vi<u>sn</u>u, endowed with discrimination above
all beings, under the control of sleep, then the above remark is
self-evident.

 

O Thou, the Player in the minds of all beings! O Mother! I am extremely
ignorant of the knowledge of Thy nature; when Bhagavân Hari is sleeping
inert by Thy power, then who is there amongst Ko<u>t</u>is and
Ko<u>t</u>is of wise men, who can understand completely the Pastime,
Leelâ, full of Mâyâ of Thine, who art beyond the Gu<u>n</u>as. The
Sânkhya philosophers say (that the Puru<u>s</u>a (the male aspect of
S’akti)

 

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

 

is the pure, conscious being and that Thou art the Prakriti, without any
consciousness, material inert, Creatrix of the universe; but, O Mother!
art Thou really inert like that? Never like that; had it been like that,
how is it that Thou hast made Bhagavân Hari, the receptable of the world
quite unconscious like this? O Bhavâni! Thou, being beyond the
Gu<u>n</u>as art displaying like a dramatic performance these various
dramatic plays by the conjunction with the three Gu<u>n</u>as. It is Thy
three qualities, Sattva, Rajas and Tamas that the Munis meditate every
day in the morning mid-day, and evening, the three Sandhyâs; but no one
is aware of Thy ways of doings. O Devî! Thou art of the nature of the
judgment and understanding giving rise to knowledge of all the beings in
the Universe; Thou art always the S’ri (wealth and prosperity) giving
pleasures to the Devas. O Mother! Thou art reigning in all as Kîrti
(fame), mati (intellect), Dhriti (fortitude). Kânti (beauty) S’raddhâ
(faith) and Rati (enjoyment). O Mother! Now I am put to great
difficulties and therefore I have got eye witness of Thy nature; no need
of further reasoning and discussing about it.

 

27-50. I have now known that verily, verily Thou art the only Mother of
all the worlds as Thou hast brought Hari under the influence of sleep. O
Devî! Now when it is evident that all the worlds, etc., have come from
Thee, then the Vedas have also come from Thee; what doubt is there? So
the Vedas, too, do not know fully Thy nature; for the effect can never
know its cause. So, it is very true that Thou art incomprehensible of
the Vedas, O Mother! When I, Hari, Hara and the other Devas and my son
Nârada and other Munis have not able to realise Thy nature fully, then
who else can be so intelligent in this world that will realise all Thy
nature? So Thy glory is beyond the speech of all beings. O Devî! If, in
the place of sacrifice, the ritualists, the knowers of the Vedas, do not
utter Thy name Svâhâ, then the Devas, participators of the offerings in
Yajña, do not get their share, however hundreds of oblations be offered;
so Thou art also the giver of sustenance allowances to the Devas. O
Bhagavatî! In previous Kalpas, Thou hadst saved me terrified from the
fear of the Dânavas. O Devî Varade! now, too, I am terrified at the
sight of the terrible forms of Madhu and Kai<u>t</u>abha and take Thy
refuge. O high-minded one! Now I thoroughly see that by Thee, by Thy
power Yoganidrâ the whole body of Bhagavân Vi<u>sn</u>u is senseless;
but how is it that Thou dost not realise my sufferings. So, either dost
Thou leave possession of this Âdi-Deva, or destroy Thyself these two
Danavendras -- lost do either of the two as Thou likest. O Devî! Those
that do not know Thy extraordinary powers, those stupid ones meditate
Hari, Hara, etc. But, O Mother! By Thy grace, I realise to-day, as
eye-witness, that Vi<u>sn</u>u even is to-day lying unconscious in deep
sleep, totally senseless of anything

 

 

outside by Thy force. O Bhagavatî! Now, when Kamalâ, the daughter of
Sindhu is unable to rouse Her husband Hari, by her effort, or rather
Thou hast made Her, too, perforce, sleep unconsciously, it seems she is
without any effort and does not know anything of what is going on
outside. O Devî! Verily those are blessed who worship Thy lotus feet
with their whole heart full of devotion and without any hope of getting
rewards, abandoning the worship of other Devas and knowing Thee as the
Creatrix of the whole world and the giver of all desires. Alas! now the
intelligence, beauty, fame, and all good qualities have forsaken Hari
and fled away to some unknown quarters. O Bhagavatî! Thou art really
adorable in the three worlds for, by Thy power of Yoganidrâ, Hari has
been kept in prison, as it were, in this way. O Mother! Thou art the
S’akti of all this universe and endowed with all prowess and energy; all
other things are Thy creation. As a dramatic player, though one, plays
in the theatre, assuming many forms, so Thou, too, being one, playest
always in this charming theatre of world, created by Thy Gu<u>n</u>as,
in various forms.

 

O Mother! Thou, in the beginning of the Yugas, dost manifest first the
Vi<u>sn</u>u form and givest him the pure Sattrik Sakti, free from any
obscuration and thereby madest Him preserve the Universe; and now it is
Thyself that hast kept Him thus unconscious; therefore, it is an
undoubted fact that Thou art doing whatever Thou willest, O Bhagavatî! I
am now in danger; if it be Thy desire not to kill me, then dost break
the silence, look on me and show Thy mercy. O Bhavâni! If it be not Thy
desire to kill me, then why hast Thou created these two Dânavas, my
death incarnate; or is it that Thou wantedest to put me to ridicule. I
have come to know of Thy wonderful acts; Thou createst this whole
Universe, and Thyself remaining aloof, playest always and in the time of
Pralaya resolvest everything again into Thee. Therefore, O Bhavâni, what
wonder is there, that Thou wouldst want to kill me in this way? But, O
Mother! I won't feel any pain if Thou willingly killest me but this is
to my great dishonour that being given power over these beings, I would
then be made an object to be killed by the Daityas; this, indeed, is
hard to me. So, O Thou Leelâmayî like a sportive girl! get up! O Devî!
assumest the wonderful form Thyself and killest me or the two Daityas,
as Thou willest; or rouse Hari who will then kill the Daityas. All these
are in Thy hands.”

 

Sûta said :-- Thus praised by Brahmâ, the Nidrâ Devî (the goddess of
sleep), of the nature of Tamo Gunas, quitted the body of Bhagavân Hari
and stood by him. When thus left completely by the Devî Yoga Nidrâ, of
unequalled brilliance and splendour, for the destruction of Madhu
Kai<u>t</u>abha, Vi<u>sn</u>u began to move his body and at this Brahmâ
became very glad.

Thus ends the seventh chapter of the First Skandha on the praise of the
Devî in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S’rimad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000
verses, by Mahar<u>s</u>i Vedavyâs.
