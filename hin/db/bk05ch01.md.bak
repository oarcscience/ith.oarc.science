**On the superiority of Rudra over Vi<u>sn</u>u**

1-5. The Ri<u>s</u>is said :-- “The great legendary story, the life of
S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, supremely divine, destructive of all sins, has been
narrated by you, O Sûta! But, O Blessed One! You, though highly
intelligent, have dwelt on it not at a great length; hence many doubts
are cropping up in our minds. A very difficult tapasyâ was performed by
Vâsudeva the part incarnate of Vi<u>sn</u>u, who had to go to forest to
worship S’iva. Next, it has been known that the Devî Pârvatî, the part
incarnate of the Great Mother, the Mother of the universe, the Supreme,
and Perfect offered boons to S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a. How did it then come to
pass that S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, being himself the God, had to worship
Pârvatî and Mahâdeva? Is it that S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a was inferior to
Mahâdeva and Pârvatî? This is our doubt.”

 

6-7. Sûta spoke :-- “Hear then, the reasons, O noble Ri<u>s</u>is! that
I heard from Vyâsa; I will now sing before you those meritorious deeds
S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>â.” The son of Parîk<u>s</u>it, the intelligent
Janamejaya had also the same doubts that you now have, when he heard the
story before from Vyâsa; and he asked the same questions that you now
ask.”

 

8-11. Janamejaya said :-- “O son of Bhagavatî! I have heard from you
much about the Supreme Goddess, the Highest Cause; still the doubts are
not leaving me. O Fortunate One! Kri<u>sn</u>a the Deva of the Devas,
the Vi<u>sn</u>u incarnate, worshipped Sambhû and had to perform dire
penances; this is my great wonder! He is the soul of all the Jîvas, the
One Ruler and Lord of this world and He is able to confer all the
Siddhis; how is it, then, that the Lord Hari had to perform very
difficult asceticism like an ordinary mortal. He who is able to create
this universe, moving and non-moving, He who is able to preserve and
destroy it, why did He practise such a terrible penance.”

 

12-54. Vyâsa said :-- “True it has been said by you that Vâsudeva the
Janârdana, is the destroyer of the Daityas and He is able to create

and preserve the Devas and do all other acts for them. But the Great
Lord assumed a human body; therefore he had to perform his duties like a
man and observe the Var<u>n</u>a and Âs'rama Dharmas pertaining to human
beings. Respecting the elderly persons, worshipping the spiritual
teachers, doing service to the Brahmâ<u>n</u>as, adoring and
propitiating the Devas, feeling sorrow at times of sorrow, feeling
pleasure at times of happiness, feeling dejection or expressing censure
or scandal, or having sexual intercourse with women, in other words, to
feel lust, anger, greediness and other passions when their proper time
arises. All these are natural to all human beings; how can, then, S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a though intrinsically of pure qualities, become
Nirgu<u>n</u>a (devoid of human qualities) when he assumed a human body
which is Sagu<u>n</u>a, i.e., with qualities. O Ruler of men! The
extinction of the Yâdava race by the curse of Gândhârî, the daughter of
Subala, and the curse of a Brâhmi<u>n</u>, Kri<u>sn</u>a's leaving his
human coil, the stealing away of his wives, the robbing of their wealth
on the way by the dacoits of the Âvîra tribe, Arjuna's becoming
powerless to hurl any weapons on those dacoits, Kri<u>sn</u>a's not
knowing anything about the stealing away of Pradyumna and Aniruddha from
his Dvârkâ palace, these all correspond verily to exertions and failings
appropriate to human bodies. Again the Ri<u>s</u>i Nârâya<u>n</u>a is
the part incarnate of Vi<u>sn</u>u, and Vâsudeva is the part incarnate
of the Ri<u>s</u>i Nârâya<u>n</u>a; hence what wonder is there, if
Vâsudeva be seen to adore and propitiate S’iva? S’iva is the God of
gods; and He is the Lord of all the causal bodies that exist; in the
state of Su<u>s</u>upti (deep sleep). In this respect, S’iva is the
creator of Vi<u>sn</u>u and Vi<u>sn</u>u worships Him in this light.
Râma, Kri<u>sn</u>a and others are all part incarnations of
Vi<u>sn</u>u; so there is no wonder if they worship S’iva. The letter A
is Bhagvân Brahmâ ; the letter “U” is Bhagvân Hari; the letter “M” is
Bhagvân Rudra and the half letter *m* is Mahes'varî, the Supreme Mother
of the universe. The sages, therefore, consider Vi<u>sn</u>u superior to
Brahmâ; they again consider Rudra superior to Vi<u>sn</u>u and
Mâhes'varî (Turîya State) again superior to Rudra. The speciality of the
half letter is that it can never be uttered; it is the symbol of the
Eternal Devî. In all the S'âstras, therefore, the superiority of the
Devî is established. Vi<u>sn</u>u is superior to Brahmâ; Rudra is
superior to Vi<u>sn</u>u. Therefore no doubt can arise in
Kri<u>sn</u>a's worshipping S’iva. It is through the will of S’iva that
a second Rudra originated from the forehead of Brahmâ to offer boons to
him (i. e., to Brahmâ). This second Rudra is venerable and entitled to
all worship; what to speak of the First Rudra? O King! It is through the
proximity of the Devî that the importance and superiority of S’iva is
thus established. Thus the incarnations of Hari arise in yugas after
yugas through the intervention of the Yoga

Mâyâ; so there is no need to discuss on this point. Why to Achyuta
alone, to Brahmâ and S’iva also She gives troubles for getting involved
into incarnations, She the Yoga Mâyâ who is indirectly, with the
twinklings of Her eyes, creating, preserving and destroying this
universe. It is the Yoga Mâyâ that caused Kri<u>sn</u>a to be
transferred from his lying-in chamber to the village Vraja and then
protected him in the house of the cowherd Nanda; afterwards took him to
Mathurâ for the destruction of Kamsa, whence he was led again out of
Jarâsandha's fear to the city Dvârkâ. It is She that created from Her
Ownself the eight Nâikâs (the leading mistresses) and also sixteen
thousand and fifty women for the pleasure and enjoyment of Kri<u>sn</u>a
Bhagwân, the incarnation of Ananta (Vi<u>sn</u>u Bhagavân); thus
Kri<u>sn</u>a Bhagavân was made completely subservient to them just like
a perfect slave. When a young woman, though she is alone, can bind a man
down by the network of Mâyâ, like strong iron chain, what wonder is
there that the sixteen thousand and fifty women would make Kri<u>sn</u>a
play in their hands like a S’uka bird and make him an instrument to
serve any purpose that they liked. S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a got himself so
much under the control of Satyabhâmâ that He went gladly under her
commands to Indra's heavens to get the Pârijâta flowers. There he had to
fight with Indra and subsequently stole away the Pârijâta tree and gave
it to Satyabhâmâ as a very valuable ornament to be kept in her room.
Behold! The same Kri<u>sn</u>a, by His own prowess, defeated S’is'upâla
and others for the preservation of religion and then stole away
Rukmi<u>n</u>î, the daughter of Bhîma and afterwards married her as his
legal wife; where is the rule, then observed that it is a sin to take
away another's wife? Thus all embodied beings get themselves subdued by
Ahamkâra and do acts, good or bad, confounded and deluded by the network
of Moha that always drags one down below. From the Mûlâ Prakriti are
born Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u, and Hara and from the Tâmasic Ahamkâra of
Prakriti is created this whole cosmos, moving and non-moving. The
lotus-born Brahmâ becomes free when he is free from Ahamkâra; otherwise
He becomes engaged in this world affairs. When freed from this Ahamkâra,
all the Jîvas become free; and their houses, wealth, wives, sons and
brothers are quite powerless to tie them down; but when bound by
Ahamkâra, the Jîvas come under their control. O king! This Ahamkâra is
the cause bondage to all the beings; “I am the doer, this work is done
by my power; or this I will do myself” thinking thus, the embodied
beings fall themselves under this bondage. An earthen pot cannot be made
without earth; no effects can be visible without a cause; consequently
Vi<u>sn</u>u is preserving this universe, because of this Ahamkâra
(imposed on

him by Prakriti). The human beings are always drowned in their cares and
anxieties simply because they are bound by this Ahamkâra; when they
become free from this Ahamkâra, their cares and anxieties at once
vanish. Moha (delusion) comes out of Ahamkâra; world and the enjoyments
thereof come out of Moha; otherwise how can it be accounted for, that
Hari and others, the mine of all good and auspiciousness, take their
several incarnations in various wombs? Neither Moha nor this world comes
to those that are bereft of Ahamkâra. Men are of three kinds, Sâttvic,
Râjasic, and Tâmasic; O king! Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u and S'iva are sprung
respectively from the Râjasic, Sâttvic, and Tâmasic Ahamkâras. In these
three, the three Ahamkâras are always to be found, so the Munis, that
have realised the Real Essence, declare. They are all bound by this
Ahamkâra; there is no doubt in this. The Pundits of dull intellect, and
deluded by Mâyâ declare that Vi<u>sn</u>u takes various incarnations out
of his own free will; for when it is seen that men of even inferior
intellects do not entertain any desire to enter into the wombs, painful
and terrible; how will Vi<u>sn</u>u, then, the Holder of the discus,
like to come into this womb! The slayer of Madhu, the Vai<u>sn</u>avas
say, entered all at once into the wombs of Kaus'alyâ and Devakî, full of
faeces and other dirty things, of His own free will. But you must think
out what happiness can Madhusûdana, quitting his Vaikun<u>t</u>ha
Heavens, attain in this womb, full of so many troubles, and where arise,
like poisons, hundreds of cares and thoughts to torment an individual!
Especially when it is seen that human beings perform asceticism,
sacrifice Yajñas and do various charities, that they would avoid thus
entering in wombs, which is very painful and terrible. How can Bhagavân
Vi<u>sn</u>u be called independent? If so, He would never have yielded
to enter into various wombs. Therefore, O king! Know this that this
whole universe is under the control of Yoga Mâyâ; the Devas, men, birds,
what more everything from Brahmâ down to a blade of grass are all under
the control of Yoga Mâyâ. Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u and Hara all are bound by
the rope of Her Mâyâ. So they roam easily by Her Mâyâ from womb to womb
like a spider.

 

Here ends the First Chapter of the Fifth Book on the superiority of
Rûdra over Vi<u>sn</u>u in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am of S'rîmad Devî
Bhâgavatam by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa, consisting of eighteen thousand
verses.
