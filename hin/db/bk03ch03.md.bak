1-5. Brahmâ said :-- “We were very much astonished not to find water
where our beautiful aeroplane landed us. We saw earth resonated with the
sweet cooings of the cuckoos, filled with beautiful fruit-laden trees,
forests and gardens. Big rivers, wells, tanks, ponds, water-springs,
small pools, women, men all are there. Next we saw, in front of us, a
nice city enclosed by a divine wall, containing many sacrificial halls
and various palatial buildings and magnificent edifices. Oh! We thought
:-- It is Heaven! What a great wonder! Who built this?

 

6-11. Next we saw a king looking like a Deva is going out on a hunting
excursion in the forest. The Devî Ambikâ, Whom we saw before, is staying
on the chariot. In an instant, our aeroplane, propelled by air got high
up above the sky and reached in the twinkling of an eye at a lovely
place. We saw there a divine Nandana garden. There Surabhi, the cow of
plenty, was staying under the shade of the Parijâta tree. Close by her,
there was an elephant having four tusks; and Menaká and other hosts of
Apsarâs were there with their various gestures and postures, playing,
dancing and singing. There were hundred of Yak<u>s</u>as, Gandharbhas,
Vidyâdharas within that Mandâra garden playing and singing. Within this
there was the Lord Satakratu with S'achî, the daughter of Pulomâ.

 

12-34. Next we saw with great wonder, Varu<u>n</u>a, the lord of the
aquatic animals, Kuvera, Yama, Sûrya (sun), fire and the other Devas;
then we saw that in our front, Indra the Lord of the Devas, was coming
out from a well decorated city. He was there situated in his palanquin,
calm and quiet and carried by men. Then the car, where we were situated,
began to

 

 

get up high in the sky, and in the twinkling of an eye, we reached
Brahmâ loka, that is saluted by all the Devas. There S'ambhu and Kes'ava
were greatly bewildered to see Brahmâ of that place. In the council hall
of Brahmâ, the Vedas with their Angas, the serpents, hills, oceans and
rivers were seen. Seeing all these, Vi<u>sn</u>u and Mahes'vara asked me
:-- “O Four-faced one! Who is this eternal Brahmâ? I replied :-- I do
not know who is this Brahmâ? Who am I? and who is He? why has this error
come over me? You, too, also are gods so you can better ponder over it.”
Next our car, going with the swiftness of mind went, in the twinkling of
an eye, to the beautiful all auspicious Kailâs'a mountain surrounded by
bliss-giving Yak<u>s</u>as. It was beautified by the Mandâra garden,
resonated by the sweet cooings of S'ukas and cuckoos and the sweet
sounds of lutes and small drums and tabors. When we reached there we saw
the five faced, three-eyed Bhagavân S'ashi S'ekhara, with ten hands,
wearing tiger skin, and the upper garment of the elephant skin. He was
then, getting out of his abode, riding on a bull. His two sons, the
great heroes, Ganes'a and Kârtikeya, beautifully adorned, were attending
Him as His body guards. Nandi and all other hosts were following Him,
chanting victories to Him. O Muni Narâda! we were greatly wondered to
see another S'ankara, surrounded by the Matrikâs. So much so, that
perplexed with doubts, I sat down there. Next our aeroplane went on with
the force of wind; and in an instant reached the abode of
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha, the amusement court of Laksmî. O Sûta! There at
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha, we saw a wonderful manifestation of power. Our
companion Vi<u>sn</u>u was greatly surprised to see that excellent city.
We saw there four-armed Vi<u>sn</u>u, of the colour of Âtasi flower,
wearing yellow garments, adorned with divine ornaments sitting on
Garu<u>d</u>a. Lak<u>s</u>mî Devî is fanning wonderful chowry to Him.
Struck with wonder at the sight of the eternal Vi<u>sn</u>u, we took our
seat on the car and looked at one another's face.

 

Next the balloon ascended with the swiftness of wind; and, in the
twinkling of an eye, reached to the ocean of nectar, the Sudhâ-Sâgar,
with waves playing sweetly on it. This ocean Sudhâ Sâgara is filled with
aquatic animals and agitated with ripples. We saw and went along and
came to a very wonderful place called the Ma<u>n</u>i Dvîpa (the island
of gems) in the midst of the Ocean. It was adorned with Mandâra and
Pàrijâta an other heavenly flower trees (plants?), with various
beautiful carpets, with variegated trees As'oka, Vakula, Ketakî,
Champaka, Kuravaka, etc., adorned with lustrous gems and pearls. It was
resonated with the sweet cooings of the cuckoos and the humming sounds
of bees; and it presented the sight of a sweet harmonious music playing
there.

 

35-67. Sitting on our aeroplane, we saw, from a distance, within that

 

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

 

Dvîpa, a beautiful cot known as S'ivâkâra (i.e. whose four legs
represent Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u, Rudra, etc., and whose top portion
represents Sadâ S’iva looking like a rainbow, with exquisitely beautiful
carpet spread over it and decked with various gems and jewels and inlaid
with pearls. We saw a Divine Lady, sitting on the cot, wearing a red
garment and a garland of red cloth and bedewed with red sandal paste.
Her eyes were dark-red; that beautiful faced red-lipped lady looked more
beautiful than ten millions of lightnings and ten millions of
Lak<u>s</u>mîs and lustrous like the Sun. The Bhagavatî Bhuvanes'varî
was sitting with a sweet smile on Her lips and holding in Her four hands
noose, goad, and signs indicating as if She was ready to grant boons and
asking Her devotees discard all fear. We never saw before such a form.
Even the birds of that place repeat the mystic incantation Hrim and
serve that Lady, Who is of the colour of the rising Sun, all merciful,
and in the full bloom of youth. That lotus-faced smiling lady was
adorned with all the beauties of Nature. Her high breasts defied the
lotus bud. She was holding various jewelled ornaments, e.g., armplates,
bracelets, diadems, etc.

 

Her lotus-face looked exceedingly beautiful with jewelled ear-rings of
the shape of the S’rî Yantra (yantra of Tripurâ Sundarî). Hrillekhâ and
other Deva girls were surrounding Her. There were Sakhis on the four
sides -- always chanting hymns to Mahes'varî, the Lady of the world. She
was surrounded on Her all sides by Ananga kusuma and other Devîs. She
was sitting in the middle of the Satkona (six angled) Yantra. We were
all wondered at the sight of this Wonderful Form never seen before and
we thought :-- “Who is this Lady? What is Her name? we know nothing of
Her, from such a distance.” Thus while we were gazing at Her, that four
armed Lady became gradually thousand eyed, with thousand hands and
thousand feet; so it seemed to us. O Nârada! We became very much
embarrassed with doubts and thought within ourselves “Is She Apsarâ
(nymph) or a Gandharva daughter or any other Deva Girl? who is She ?” At
this juncture Bhagavân Vi<u>sn</u>u saw closely the sweet smiling Devî
and by his intelligence came to a definite conclusion and spoke to us
:-- “This is the Devî Bhagavatî Mahâvidyâ Mahâ Mâyâ, undecaying and
eternal; She is the Full, the Prakriti; She is the Cause of us all. This
Devî is inconceivable to those who are of dull intellects; only the
Yogis can see Her by their Yoga-powers. She is eternal (Brahmâ) and also
non-eternal (Mâyâ). She is the Will-force of the Supreme Self. She is
the First Creatrix of this world.

 

This Devî with wide eyes, the Lady of the Universe, has produced the
Vedas. The less-fortunate persons cannot worship Her. During the time of
Pralaya, She destroys all the Universe, draws within Her body all

 

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

 

the subtle bodies (Linga-Sarîras), and plays. O two Devas! At present
She is residing in the form of the Seed of the Universe. Behold! On Her
sides are seen duly all the Vibhûtis (manifestations of powers). They
are all adorned with divine ornaments and anointed with divine scents
and are serving Her. O Brahmân! O S'ankara! To-day we are blessed and
highly fortunate that we have got the sight of this Devî. The tapasyâ
(asceticisms) that we practised of yore have yielded to us this fruit.
Else why Bhagavatî has shown so carefully Her own form? Those who are
highly meritorious by tapasyâs and gifts of abundant wealth, those high
souled persons are able to see this all-auspicious Bhagavatî. The person
attached to sensual objects can never see Her. It is She that is the
Mûlâ Prakriti, united with the Chidânanda Person. It is She that creates
this Brahmânda and exhibits it to the Paramâtmâ (the Supreme Self). O
two Devas! This whole Universe and all the Seers and Seen and other
things contained therein owe to Her as their sole cause. She is the Mâyâ
assuming all forms; She is the Goddess of all. Where is I myself! Where
are the Devas! Where are Laksmî and the other Devîs! We cannot compare
to one-hundred thousandth part of Her. It is this all-excellent Lady,
Whom I saw in the great Ocean when She reckoned Me who was baby then
with greatest gladness. In former days, when I was sleeping on the cot
made of immoveable fixed leaves of a banyan tree and licking my toe,
making it enter within my mouth and playing like an ordinary baby, this
Lady rocked my gentle body to and fro on the banyan leaves singing songs
like a Mother. Now I recollect all what I felt before at Her sight and
recognise that She is the Bhagavatî. These very things I now communicate
to you. Hear attentively that She is this Lady and She is our Mother.”

 

Thus ends the third chapter of the Third Skandha on seeing the Devî in
the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S’rîmad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâs.
