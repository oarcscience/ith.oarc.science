1-21. S’rî Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! There are the six kinds of
Âchamana :-- (1) S’uddha, (2) Smârta, (3) Paurâ<u>n</u>ik, (4) Vaidik,
(5) Tântrik and(6) S’rauta. The act of cleaning after evacuating oneself
of urine and faeces is known as S’uddha S’aucha. After cleaning, the
Âchaman, that is

 

<span id="page_1062">p. 1062</span>

 

performed according to rules, is named as Smârta and Paurâ<u>n</u>ik. In
places where the Brahmâ Yajña is performed, the Vaidik and S’rauta
Âchamanas are done. And where acts, e.g., the knowledge of warfare are
being executed, the Tântrik Âchaman is done. Then he is to remember the
Gâyatrî Mantra with Pra<u>n</u>ava (Om) and fasten the lock of hair on
the crown of his head, thus controlling all the hindrances (Bighna
Bandhanam). Sipping again, he is to touch his heart, two arms, and his
two shoulders. After sneezing, spitting, touching the lower lip with
teeth, accidentally telling a lie, and talking with a very sinful man,
he is to touch his right ear (where the several Devas reside). On the
right ear of the Brâhma<u>n</u>as reside Fire, Water, the Vedas, the
Moon, the Sun, and the Vâyu (wind). Then one is to go to a river or any
other reservoir of water, and there to perform one's morning ablutions
and to cleanse his body thoroughly. For the body is always unclean and
dirty and various diets are being excreted out of the nine holes (doors)
in the body. The morning bath removes all these impurities. Therefore
the morning bath is essentially necessary. The sins that arise from
going to those who are not fit for such purposes, from accepting gifts
from impure persons or from the practice of any other secret vices all
are removed by the morning ablutions. Without this bath, no acts bear
any fruit. Therefore everyday, this morning bath is very necessary.
Taking the Kus'a grass in hand, one is to perform one's bath and
Sandhyâ. If for seven days, the morning ablutions are not taken, and if
for three days, the Sandhyâs are not performed, if for twelve days, the
daily Homas be not performed, the Brâhma<u>n</u>as become S’ûdras. The
time for making the Homa in the morning is very little; therefore lest
ablutions be done fully which would take a long time and hence the time
for the Homa might elapse, the morning bath should be performed quickly.
After the bath the Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma is to be done. Then the full effects
of bath are attained. There is nothing holier in this world or in the
next than reciting the Gâyatrî. It saves the singer who sings the
Gâyatrî; hence it is called Gâyatrî. During the time of
Prâ<u>n</u>âyâma, one must control one's Prâ<u>n</u>a and Apâ<u>n</u>a
Vâyus, i.e., make them equal. The Brâhmi<u>n</u>, knowing the Vedas and
devoted to his Dharma, must practise Prânâyâma three times with the
repetition of Gâyatrî and Pra<u>n</u>ava and the three Vyârhitis (Om
Bhu, Om Bhuvar, Om Sva<u>h</u>).

 

While practising, the muttering of Gâyatrî is to be done three times. In
Prânâyâma, the Vaidik mantra is to be repeated, never a Laukika Mantra
is to be uttered. At the time of Prânâyâma, if anybody's mind be not
fixed, even for a short while, like a mustard seed on the apex of a
cow-horn, he cannot save even one hundred-and one persons in his
father's

or in his mother's line. Prânâyâma is called Sagarbha when performed
with the repetition of some mantra; it is called Agarbha when it is done
simply with mere meditation, without repeating any mantra. After the
bathing, the Tarpa<u>n</u>am with its accompaniments, is to he done;
i.e., the peace offerings are made with reference to the Devas, the
Ri<u>s</u>is, and the Pitris (whereby we invoke the blessings from the
subtle planes where the highsouled persons dwell). After this, a clean
pair of clothes is to be worn and then he should get up and come out of
the water. The next things preparatory to practise Japam are to wear the
Tilaka marks of ashes and to put on the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads. He who
holds thirty-two Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads on his neck, forty on his head,
six on each ear (12 on two ears), twenty four beads on two hands (twelve
on each hand) thirty-two beads on two arms (sixteen on each), one bead
on each eye and one bead on the hair on the crown, and one hundred and
eight beads on the breast, (251 in all) becomes himself Mahâ Deva. One
is expected to use them as such. O Muni! You can use the
Rudrâk<u>s</u>as after tieing, stringing together with gold or silver
always on your S’ikhâ, the tuft of hair on the head or on your ears. On
the holy thread, on the hands, on the neck, or on the belly (abdomen)
one can keep the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a after one has repeated sincerely and
with devotion the five lettered mantra of S’iva, or one has repeated the
Prâ<u>n</u>âva (Om). Holding the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a implies that the man
has realised the knowledge of S’iva Tattva. O Brahmâ<u>n</u>! The
Rudrâk<u>s</u>a bead that is placed on the tuft or on the crown hair
represents the Târa tattva, i.e., Om Kâra; the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads
that are held on the two ears are to be thought of as Deva and Devî,
(S’iva and S’ivâ).

 

22-37. The one hundred and eight Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads on the
sacrificial thread are considered as the one hundred and eight Vedas
(signifying the Full Knowledge, as sixteen digits of the Moon completed;
on the arms, are considered as the Dik (quarters); on the neck, are
considered as the Devî Sarasvatî and Agni (fire). The Rudrâk<u>s</u>a
beads ought to be taken by men of all colours and castes. The
Brâhma<u>n</u>as, K<u>s</u>attriyas and Vais'yas should hold them after
purifying them with Mantras, i.e., knowingly; whereas the S’ûdras can
take them without any such purification by the Mantras, i.e.,
unknowingly. By holding or putting on the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads, persons
become the Rudras incarnate in flesh and body. There is no doubt in
this. By this all the sins arising from seeing, hearing, remembering,
smelling, eating prohibited things, talking incoherently, doing
prohibited things, etc., are entirely removed with the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a
beads on the body; whatever acts, eating, drinking, smelling, etc., are
done, are, as it were, done by Rudra Deva Himself. O Great Muni! He who
feels

 

<span id="page_1064">p. 1064</span>

 

shame in holding and putting on the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads, can never be
freed from this Samsâra even after the Ko<u>t</u>i births. He who blames
another person holding Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads has defects in his birth
(is a bastard). There is no doubt in this. It is by holding on
Rudrâk<u>s</u>a that Brahmâ has remained steady in His Brahmâhood
untainted and the Munis have been true to their resolves. So there is no
act better and higher than holding the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads. He who
gives clothing and food to a person holding Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads with
devotion is freed of all sins and goes to the S’iva Loka. He who feasts
gladly any holder of such beads at the time of S’râdh, goes undoubtedly
to the Pitri Loka. He who washes the feet of a holder of Rudrâk<u>s</u>a
and drinks that water, is freed of all sins and resides with honour in
the S’iva Loka. If a Brâhma<u>n</u>a holds with devotion the
Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads with a necklace and gold, he attains the
Rudrahood. O Intelligent One! Wherever whoever holds with or without
faith and devotion the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads with or without any mantra,
is freed of all sins and is entitled to the Tattvajñâna. I am unable to
describe fully the greatness of the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads. In fact, all
should by all means hold the Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads on their bodies.

 

Note :-- The number one hundred and eight (108) signifies the One
Hundred and Eight Vedas, the Brahmâ<u>n</u>, the Source of all Wisdom
and Joy.

 

Here ends the Third Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the glories of the
Rudrâk<u>s</u>a beads in the Mahâ Pura<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî
Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahâr<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
