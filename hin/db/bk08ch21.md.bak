1-9. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Devar<u>s</u>i! Sanâtana, the son of
Brahmâ, recites thus in the assembly of the Devas, the glories of the
Bhagavân Ananta Deva, and worships Him, thus :-- How can one of ordinary
sight and understanding grasp the real nature of Brahmâ, Whose mere
Glance enables the Prakriti work Her Gu<u>n</u>as in the Creation,
Preservation and Destruction of this Universe! Him Whose nature has no
beginning nor end; Who though One, has created all this Prapañcha (the
universe of five elements) as a covering to the Âtman (the True Self).
He has made the Sat and Asat, out of his infinite compassion, this
universe, full of cause and effect, visible in His One and only one
S’uddha Sattva nature where even the very powerful lion is imitating his
Leelâ (Pastime), void of all defects, to bring under His control the
minds of His own kinsmen. (Note :-- This Ananta Deva is the Ruling
Principle in the Fourth Dimensional Space.) To Whom else, then, the
persons, desirous of Mok<u>s</u>a, will take refuge, the mere hearing or
reciting Whose Name, in a fallen or a distressed condition, or merely in
jest, takes away instantly all the sins! He is upholding the earth with
the mountains, oceans, rivers and all the beings as if an atom on his
thousand heads. He is infinite. His power knows no decrease in any time.
No one can describe his actions even if one had thousand tongues to
speak. He is of an infinite strength, of the endless high qualities and
of unlimited understanding. Thus staying at the bottom of the earth, the
Bhagavân Ananta Deva is upholding with ease this earth for her
protection, unaided and independent. O Muni! The people get the fruits
of their actions and desires as they

want and as they have followed the paths laid down in the S’âstras and
become accordingly kings, men, deer or birds or other creatures in other
states. O Nârada! This I have described, as you questioned me before,
the various and dissimilar fruits of various actions, done according to
the dictates of the Dharma and the S’âstras.

 

10\. Nârada said :-- “O Bhagavân! Kindly describe to me now why has the
Bhagavân created so many diversities, when the Karmas, done by the
Jîvas, are the same.”

 

11-28. Nâraya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! So many different states arise
because the S’raddhâs of the doers are so very different. The fruits
differ because the S’raddhâs vary, some being Sâttvik, some Râjasik and
some Tâmasik. If the S’raddhâ be Sâttvik, happiness comes always; if it
be Râjasik, incessant pain and misery is the result; if it be Tâmasik,
misery comes and the loss of the knowledge of good or bad is the result.
Thus the fruits differ as the S’raddhâ varies. O Best of Dvîjas!
Thousands and thousands of states occur to a man as the result of their
Karmas, done under the influence of the beginningless Avidyâ
(Nescience). O Dvîjottama! I will now deal in detail with their
varieties; hear. Behind this Triloki, below this earth and over the
Atala, the Pitris named Agni<u>s</u>vâttas and other forefathers live.
Those Pitris stay there, and, practising deep Samâdhis, they offer
always, to their best blessings to their own Gotra (families)
respectively. There Yama, the God of the Pitris gives punishment to the
dead brought there by His messengers according to their Karmas and
faults. By the command of the Bhagavân, the Yama, surrounded by his own
Ga<u>n</u>as (persons), judges and does full justice according to the
Karmas that they had done and the sins they had committed. He sends
always those of his messengers who obey his order and know the Tattva of
Dharma, and who are posted to their respective duties to carry out what
He commands. The writers of the S’âstras describe twenty-one Narakas or
hells; others say there are twenty-eight hells. Now hear their names :--
Tâmisra, Andha Tâmisra, Raurava, Mahâraurava, Kumbhîpâka, Kâlasûtra,
Asipatrakânana, S’ûkaramukha, Andhakûpa, Krimibhojana, Taptamûrti,
Samdams’a, Vajraka<u>nt</u>aka, S’âlmalî, Vaitara<u>n</u>î, Pûyoda,
Prâ<u>n</u>arodha, Vis’asana, Lâlâbhak<u>s</u>a, Sârameyâdana, Avîchi,
Apahpâna, K<u>s</u>ârakardama, Rak<u>s</u>oga<u>n</u>a, Sambhoja,
S’ûlaprota, Dandas’ûka, Ava<u>t</u>ârodha, Paryâvartanaka, and
Sûchimukha. These are the twenty-eight Narakas or hells. (N.B. These are
29).

 

These hells are very tormenting. O Son of Brahmâ! The embodied beings
(jîvas) suffer these according to their own Karmas respectively.

Here ends the Twenty-first Chapter of the Eighth Book on the narrative
of hells in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am, S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam, of 18,000
verses, by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
