<span id="page_1174">p. 1174</span>

 

1-20. Vyâsa said :-- O King Janamejaya! What is known in the S’rutis, in
the Subâla Upani<u>s</u>ada, as the Sarvaloka over the Brahmaloka, that
is Ma<u>n</u>idvîpa. Here the Devî resides. This region is superior to
all the other regions. Hence it is named “Sarvaloka.” The Devî built
this place of yore according to Her will. In the very beginning, the
Devî Mûla Prakriti Bhagavatî built this place for Her residence,
superior to Kailâs’a, Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha and Goloka. Verily no other place
in this universe can stand before it. Hence it is called
Ma<u>n</u>idvîpa or Sarvaloka as superior to all the Lokas. This
Ma<u>n</u>idvîpa is situated at the top of all the regions,

 

<span id="page_1175">p. 1175</span>

 

and resembles an umbrella. Its shadow falls on the Brahmâ<u>nd</u>a and
destroys the pains and sufferings of this world. Surrounding this
Ma<u>n</u>idvîpa exists an ocean called the Sudhâ Samudra, many yojanas
wide and many yojanas deep. Many waves arise in it due to winds. Various
fishes and conches and other aquatic animals play and here the beach is
full of clear sand like gems. The sea-shores are kept always cool by the
splashes of the waves of water striking the beach. Various ships decked
with various nice flags are plying to and fro. Various trees bearing
gems are adorning the beach. Across this ocean, there is an iron
enclosure, very long and seven yojanas wide, very high so as to block
the Heavens. Within this enclosure wall the military guards skilled in
war and furnished with various weapons are running gladly to and fro.
There are four gateways or entrances; at every gate there are hundreds
of guards and various hosts of the devotees of the Devî. Whenever any
Deva comes to pay a visit to the Jagadîs’varî, their Vâhanas (carriers)
and retinue are stopped here. O King! This place is being resounded with
the chimings of the bells of hundreds of chariots of the Devas and the
neighings of their horses and the sounds of their hoofs. The Devas walk
here and there with canes in their hands and they are chiding at
intervals the attendants of the Devas. This place is so noisy that no
one can hear clearly another’s word. Here are seen thousands of houses
adorned with trees of gems and jewels and tanks filled with plenty of
tasteful good sweet waters. O King! After this there is a second
enclosure wall, very big and built of white copper metal (an amalgam of
zinc or tin and copper); it is so very high that it almost touches the
Heavens. It is hundred times more brilliant than the preceding enclosure
wall; there are many principal entrance gates and various trees here.
What to speak of the trees there more than this that all the trees that
are found in this universe are found there and they bear always flowers,
fruits and new leaves! All the quarters are scented with their sweet
fragrance!

 

21-40. O King! Now hear, in brief, the names of some of the trees that
are found in abundance there :-- Panasa, Vakula, Lodhra,
Kar<u>n</u>ikâra, S’ins’apa, Deodâra, Kânchanâra, mango, Sumeru,
Likucha, Hingula, Elâ, Labanga, Ka<u>t</u> fruit tree, Pâ<u>t</u>ala,
Muchukunda, Tâla, Tamâla, Sâla, Kankola, Nâgabhdra, Punnâga, Pîlu,
Sâlvaka, Karpûra, As’vakar<u>n</u>a, Hastikar<u>n</u>a,
Tâlapar<u>n</u>a, Pomegranate, Ga<u>n</u>ikâ, Bandhujîva, Jamvîra,

<span id="page_1176">p. 1176</span>

 

Khadira, Bhallâtaka, Ruchaka, Ku<u>t</u>aja, Bel tree and others, the
Talasî and Mallikâ and other forest plants. The place is interspersed
with various forests and gardens. At intervals there are wells, tanks,
etc., adding very much to the beauty of the place. The cuckoos are
perching on every tree and they are cooing sweetly, the bees are
drinking the honey and humming all around, the trees are emitting juices
and sweet fragrance all around. The trees are casting cool nice shadows.
The trees of all seasons are seen here; on the tops of these are sitting
pigeons, parrots, female birds of the Mayanâ species and other birds of
various other species. There are seen rivers flowing at intervals
carrying many juicy liquids. The Flamingoes, swans, and other aquatic
animals are playing in them. The breeze is stealing away the perfumes of
flowers and carrying it all around. The deer are following this breeze.
The wild mad peacocks are dancing with madness and the whole place looks
very nice, lovely and charming. Next this Kâ<u>m</u>sya enclosure comes
the third enclosure wall of copper. It is square shaped and seven
yojanas high. Within this are forests of Kalpavrik<u>s</u>as, bearing
golden leaves and flowers and fruits like gems. Their perfumes spread
ten yojanas and gladden things all around. The king of the seasons
preserves always this place. The king’s seat is made of flowers; his
umbrella is of flowers; ornaments made of flowers; he drinks the honey
of the flowers; and, with rolling eyes, he lives here always with his
two wives named Madhu S’rî and Mâdhava S’rî. The two wives of Spring
have their faces always smiling. They play with bunches of flowers. This
forest is very pleasant. Oh! The honey of the flowers is seen here in
abundance. The perfumes of the full blown flowers spread to a distance
of ten yojanas. The Gandharbhas, the musicians, live here with their
wives.

 

41-60. The places round this are filled with the beauties of the spring
and with the cooing of cuckoos. No doubt this place intensifies the
desires of the amorous persons! O King! Next comes the enclosure wall,
made of lead. Its height is seven yojanas. Within this enclosure there
is the garden of the Santânaka tree. The fragrance of its flowers
extends to ten yojanas. The flowers look like gold and are always in
full bloom. Its fruits are very sweet. They seem to be imbued with
nectar drops. In this garden resides always the Summer Season with his
two wives S’ukra S’rî and S’uchi S’rî. The inhabitants of this place
always remain under trees; otherwise they will be scorched by summer
rays. Various Siddhas and Devas inhabit this place. The female
sensualists here get their bodies all anointed with sandal paste and all
decked with flower

 

<span id="page_1177">p. 1177</span>

 

garlands and they stalk to and fro with fans in their hands. There is
water to be found here very cool and refreshing. And owing to heat all
the people here use this water. Next to this lead enclosure comes the
wall made of brass, the fifth enclosure wall. It is seven yojanas long.
In the centre is situated the garden of Hari Chandana trees. Its ruler
is the Rainy Season.

 

The lightnings are his auburn eyes; the clouds are his armour, the
thunder is his voice and the rainbow is his arrow. Surrounded by his
hosts he rains incessantly. He has twelve wives :-- (1) Nabhah S’rî, (2)
Nabhahsya S’rî, (3) Svarasya, (4) Rasyasâlinî, (5) Ambâ, (6) Dulâ, (7)
Niratni, (8) Abhramantî, (9) Megha Yantikâ, (10) Var<u>s</u>ayantî, (11)
Chivu<u>n</u>ikâ, and (12) Vâridhârâ (some say Madamattâ). All the trees
here are always seen with new leaves and entwined with new creepers. The
whole site is covered all over with fresh green leaves and twigs. The
rivers here always flow full and the current is strong, indeed! The
tanks here are very dirty like the minds of worldly persons attached to
worldly things. The devotees of the Devî, the Siddhas and the Devas and
those that consecrated in their life times tanks, wells, and reservoirs
for the satisfaction of the Devas dwell here with their wives. O King!
Next to this brass enclosure comes, the sixth enclosure wall made of
five fold irons. It is seven yojanas long. In the centre is situated the
Garden of Mandâra trees. This garden is beautified by various creepers,
flowers and leaves. The Autumn season lives here with his two wives
I<u>s</u>alak<u>s</u>mî and Ûrjalak<u>s</u>mî and he is the ruler.
Various Siddha persons dwell here with their wives, well clothed. O
King! Next to this comes the seventh enclosure wall, seven yojanas long
and built of silver.

 

61-80. In the centre is situated the garden of Pârijâta trees. They are
filled with bunches of flowers. The fragrance of these Pârijâtas extend
upto the ten Yojanas and gladden all the things all around. Those who
are the Devî Bhaktas and who do the works of the Devî are delighted with
this fragrance. The Hemanta (Dewy) season is the Regent of this place.
He lives here with his two wives Saha S’rî and Sahasya S’rî and with his
hosts. Those who are of a loving nature are pleased hereby. Those who
have become perfect by performing the Vratas of the Devî live here also.
O King! Next to this silver, there comes the eighth enclosure wall built
of molten gold. It is seven Yojanas long. In the centre there is the
garden of the Kadamba tree. The trees are always covered with fruits and
flowers and the honey is coming out always from the trees from all the
sides. The devotees of the Devî drink this honey always and feel intense
delight; the Dewy Season is the Regent of this

 

<span id="page_1178">p. 1178</span>

 

place. He resides here with his two wives Tapah S’rî and Tapasyâ S’rî
and his various hosts, and enjoys gladly various objects of enjoyments.
Those who had made various gifts for the Devî’s satisfaction, those
great Siddha Puru<u>s</u>as live here with their wives and relatives
very gladly in various enjoyments. O King! Next to this golden enclosure
well comes the ninth enclosure made of red Kum Kum like (saffron)
Pu<u>s</u>parâga gems. The ground inside this enclosure, the ditches or
the basins for water dug round their roots are all built of
Pu<u>s</u>parâga gems. Next to this wall there are other enclosure walls
built of various other gems and jewels; the sites, forests, trees,
flowers birds, rivers, tanks, lotuses, ma<u>nd</u>apas (halls) and their
pillars are all built respectively of those gems. Only this is to be
remembered that those coming nearer and nearer to the centre are one
lakh times more brilliant than the ones receding from them. This is the
general rule observed in the construction of these enclosures and the
articles contained therein. Here the Regents of the several quarters,
the Dikpâlas, representing the sum total of the several Dikpâlas of
every Brahmâ<u>nd</u>a and their guardians reside. On the eastern
quarter is situated the Amarâvatî city. Here the high-peaked mountains
exist and various trees are seen. Indra, the Lord of the Devas, dwells
here. Whatever beauty exists in the separate Heavens in the several
places, one thousand times, rather more than that, exists in the Heaven
of this cosmic Indra, the thousand-eyed, here. Here Indra mounting on
the elephant Airâvata, with thunderbolt in his hand, lives with S’achî
Devî and other immortal ladies and with the hosts of the Deva forces. On
the Ag<u>n</u>i (south-eastern) corner is the city of Ag<u>n</u>i. This
represents the sum total of the several cities of Ag<u>n</u>i in
different Brahmâ<u>nd</u>as.

 

81-100. Here resides the Ag<u>n</u>i Deva very gladly with his two wives
Svâhâ and Svadhâ and with his Vâhana and the other Devas. On the south
is situated the city of Yama, the God of Death. Here lives Dharma Râja
with rod in his hand and with Chitragupta and several other hosts. On
the south-westen corner is the place of the Râk<u>s</u>asas. Here
resides Nirriti with his axe in his hand and with his wife and other
Râk<u>s</u>asas. On the west is the city of Varu<u>n</u>a. Here
Varu<u>n</u>a râja resides with his wife Vârunî and intoxicated with the
drink of Vârunî honey; his weapon is the noose, his Vâhana is the King
of fishes and his subjects are the aquatic animals. On the north-western
corner dwells Vâyudeva. Here Pavana Deva lives with his wife and with
the Yogis perfect in the practice of Prânâyâma. He holds a flag in his
hand.

 

<span id="page_1179">p. 1179</span>

 

His Vâhana, is deer and his family consists of the forty nine Vâyus. On
the north resides the Yak<u>s</u>as. The corpulent King of the
Yak<u>s</u>as, Kuvera, lives here with his S’aktis Vriddhi and Riddhi,
and in possession of various gems and jewels. His generals
Ma<u>n</u>ibhadra, Pur<u>n</u>a bhadra, Ma<u>n</u>imân,
Ma<u>n</u>ikandhara, Ma<u>n</u>ibhûsa, Manisragvî,
Ma<u>n</u>ikar-mukadhârî, etc., live here. On the north eastern corner
is situated the Rudra loka, decked with invaluable gems. Here dwells the
Rudra Deva. On His back is kept the arrow-case and he holds a bow in his
left hand. He looks very angry and his eyes are red with anger. There
are other Rudras like him with bows and spears and other weapons,
surrounding him. The faces of some of them are distorted; some are very
horrible indeed! Fire is coming out from the mouths of some others. Some
have ten hands; some have hundred hands and some have thousand hands;
some have ten feet; some have ten heads whereas some others have three
eyes. Those who roam in the intermediate spaces between the heaven and
earth, those who move on the earth, or the Rudras mentioned in the
Rudrâdhyâya all live here. O King! Îsâna, the Regent of the north
eastern quarter lives here with Bhadrakâlî and other Mâtriga<u>n</u>as,
with Ko<u>t</u>is and Ko<u>t</u>is of Rudrâ<u>n</u>îs and with
<u>D</u>âmarîs and Vîra Bhadras and various other S’aktis. On his neck
there is a garland of skulls, on his hand there is a ring of snakes; he
wears a tiger skin; his upper clothing is a tiger skin and his body is
smeared with the ashes of the dead. He sounds frequently his
<u>D</u>amaru; this sound reverberates on all sides, he makes big laughs
called A<u>tt</u>ahâsya, reverberating through the heavens. He remains
always surrounded with Pramathas and Bhûtas; they live here.

 

Here ends the Tenth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on the description of
Ma<u>n</u>i Dvîpa in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of
18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
