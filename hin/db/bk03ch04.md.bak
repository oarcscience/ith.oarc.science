1-20. Brahmâ said :-- Thus speaking, Bhagavân Janârdana Vi<u>sn</u>u
spoke to me again :-- “Come, let us bow down to Her again and again and
let us go to Her. We shall reach at Her feet fearlessly and we will
chant hymns to Her; Mahâ Mâyâ will be pleased with us and will grant us
boons. If the guards at the entrance prevent us from going, we would
stand at the gateway and we will chant hymns to the Devî with one mind.”

 

Brahmâ said :-- When Hari addressed us in the above way, we two became
choked by intense feelings of joy; our voice became tremulous and

we waited there for some time; our hearts were elated with joy to go to
Her. We then accepted Hari's word said “Om” and got down from our car
and went with hastened steps and with fear to the gate. Seeing us
standing at the gateway, the Devî Bhagâvatî smiled and within an instant
transformed us three into females. We looked beautiful and youthful
women, adorned with nice ornaments; thus we greatly wondered and went to
Her. Seeing us standing at Her feet in feminine forms, the beautiful
Devî Bhagâvatî, looked on us with eyes of affection. We then bowed to
the great Devî, looked at one another and stood before Her in that
feminine dress. We three, then, began to see the pedestal of the great
Devî, shining with the lustre of ten million Suns and decorated with
various gems and jewels. We next discerned that thousands and thousands
of attendants are waiting on Her. Some of them are wearing red dress;
some blue dress, some yellow dress; thus the Deva girls, variously
dressed were serving Her and standing by Her side. They were dancing,
singing on and playing with musical instruments and were gladly chanting
hymns in praise of the Devî. O Nârada!We saw there another wonderful
thing. Listen. We saw the whole universe, moving and non-moving within
the nails of the lotus feet of the Devî. We saw there myself,
Vi<u>sn</u>u, Rudra, Vâyu, Agni, Yama, Moon, Sun, Varu<u>n</u>a,
Tva<u>st</u>â, Indra, Kuvera and other Devas, Apsarâs, Gandarbhas,
rivers, oceans, mountains, Visvâvasus Chitraketu, Sveta, Chitrângada,
Nârada, Tumburu, Hâ Hâ Hû Hû and other Gandarbhas, the twin As'vins, the
eight Vasus, Sâdhyas, Siddhas, the Pitris, Ananta and other Nâgas,
Kinnaras, Uragas, Râksasas, the abode of Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha, the abode of
Brahmâ, Kailas'a mountain, the best of all mountains; all were existing
there. Within that nail of the toe were, reflected all the things of the
Universe. The lotus whence I was born, the four faced Brahmâ like myself
on that lotus, Bhagavân Jagannâth lying on that bed of Ananta, the two
Demons Madhu Kaitabha, all I saw there.

 

21-31. Seeing all these wonderful things within the nails of Her lotus
feet, I became greatly surprised and thought timidly :-- “What are all
these!” My companions Vi<u>sn</u>u and S'ankara were struck with wonder.
We three, then, made out that She was our Mother of the universe.

 

Thus full one hundred years passed away in seeing the various glories of
the Devî in the auspicious nectar-like Mani Dvîpa; as long we were
there, Her attendants, the Deva girls adorned with various ornaments
gladly considered us as Sakhîs. We, too, were greatly fascinated by
their enchanting gestures and postures. For that reason, we saw always
their beautiful movements with great gladness. Once, on an occasion,
Bhagavân Vi<u>sn</u>u, while He was in that feminine form, chanted hymns
in praise of the great Devî S’rî Bhuvanes\`varî.

 

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

 

S’rî Bhagavân said :-- Salutation to the Devî Prakriti, the Creatrix; I
bow down again and again to Thee. Thou art all-auspicious and grantest
the desires of Thy devotees; Thou art of the nature of Siddhi (success)
and Vriddhi (increase). I bow down again and again to Thee. I bow down
to the World Mother, Who is of the nature of Everlasting Existence,
Intelligence and Bliss. O Devî! Thou createst, preservest and destroyest
this Universe; Thou dost the Pralaya (the great Dissolution) and showest
favour to the created beings. Thus Thou art the Authoress of the above
five fold things that are done; so, O Bhuvanes’varî, I bow down to Thee!
Thou art the great efficient and material cause of the changeful. Thou
art the Unchangeable, Immoveable Consciousness; Thou art the half letter
(Ardhamâtrâ), Hrillekhâ (the consciousness that ever pervades both
inside and outside the Universe); Thou art the Supreme Soul and the
individual soul. Salutation again and again to Thee.

 

O Mother! I now realise fully well that this whole Universe rests on
Thee; it rises from Thee and again melts away in Thee. The creation of
this Universe shews Thy infinite force. Verily, Thou art become Thyself
all these Lokas (regions). During the time of creation Thou createst the
two formless elements akâsâ and Vâyu and the three elements with form,
fire, water, and earth; then with these Thou createst the whole Universe
and shewest this to the Enjoyer Puru<u>s</u>a, who is of the nature of
consciousness, for His satisfaction. Thou again dost become the material
cause of the twentythree (23) Tattvas, Mahat, etc., as enumerated in the
Sânkhya system and appearest to us like a mirage.

 

32\. O Mother! Were it not for Thee, no object would be visible, Thou
pervadest the whole Universe. It is for this reason that those persons
that are wise declare that even the Highest Puru<u>s</u>a can do no work
without Thy aid.

 

33-34. O Devî! Thou createst and art giving satisfaction to the whole
Universe by Thy power; again at the time of Pralaya Thou swallowest
forcibly all these that are seen. So, O Devî! Who can fathom Thy powers?
O Mother! Thou didst save us from the hands of Madhu and Kaitabha. Then
Thou hast brought us to this Mani Dvîpa and shewed us Thy own form, all
the extended regions and immense powers and given us exquisite delight
and joy. This is the highest place of happiness.

 

35-37. O Mother! When I Myself, S'ankara and Brahmâ or any one of us is
unable to fathom Thy inconceivable glory, who else can then ascertain? O
Bhavânî! Who knows, how many more than the several regions that we saw
reflected in thy nails of Thy feet, exist in Thy creation. O One endowed
with infinitely great powers! O Devî! we saw another Vi<u>sn</u>u,
another Hara, another Brahmâ, all of great celebrity in the Universe
exhibited by Thee; who knows how many other such Brahmâs,

 

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

 

etc., exist in Thy other Universes! Thy glory is infinite. O Mother! I
bow down again and again to Thy lotus feet and pray to Thee that may Thy
this form exist always in my mind. May my mouth always utter Thy name
and may my two eyes see always Thy lotus feet.

 

38-43. O Revered One! May I remember Thee as my Goddess and may'st Thou
constantly look on myself as Thy humble servant. O Mother! What more
shall I say than this :-- May this relation as mother and son always
exist between Thee and me. O World-Mother! There is nothing in this
world that is not known to Thee for Thou art omniscient. So O Bhavânî!
What more shall my humble self declare to Thee! Now dost Thou do
whatever Thou desirest. O Devî! The rumour goes that Brahmâ is the
Creator, Vi<u>sn</u>u is the Preserver, and Mahes'vara is the Destroyer!
Is this true? O Eternal One! It is through Thy Will power, through Thy
force, that we create, preserve and destroy. O Daughter of the Himalaya
mountain! The earth is supporting this Universe; it is Thy endless might
that is holding all this made of five elements. O Grantress of boons! It
is through Thy power and lustre that the Sun is lustrous and becomes
visible. Though Thou art the attributeless Self, yet by Thy Mâyic power
Thou appearest in the form of this Prapancha Universe. When Brahmâ,
Mahes'a, and I myself take birth by Thy power and are not eternal, what
more can be said of Indra and other Devas than this that they are mere
temporary things and created. It is only Thou that art Eternal, Ancient
Prakriti and the Mother of this Universe. O Bhavânî! Now I realise from
my remaining with Thee, that it is Thou that dost impart, out of mercy,
the Brahmâ vidyâ to the ancient Puru<u>s</u>a; and thus He can realise
His eternal nature. Otherwise He will remain always under delusion that
He is the Lord, He is the Puru<u>s</u>a without beginning, that He is
good and the Universal Soul, and thus suffers under various forms of
egoism (Ahamkâra).

 

Thou art the Vidyâ of the intelligent persons and the S’akti of the
be­ings endowed with force; Thou art Kîrtî (fame), Kânti (lustre),
Kamalâ (wealth) and the spotless Tu<u>st</u>i (peace, happiness).
Amongst men, Thou art the dispassion, leading to Mukti (complete freedom
from bondage). Thou art the Gâyatri, the mother of the Vedas; and Thou
art Svahâ, Svadhâ, etc. Thou art the Bhâgavatî, of the nature of the
three Gu<u>n</u>as; Thou art the half mâtrâ (half the upper stroke of a
letter), the fourth state, transcending the Gu<u>n</u>as. It is Thou
that givest always the S’âstras for the preservation of the Devas and
the Brâhma<u>n</u>as. It is Thou that hast expanded and manifested this
whole phenomenon of the visible Universe for the liberation of the
embodied souls (Jîvas), the parts of the pure holy Brâhma<u>n</u>, the
Full, the Beginningless, the Deathless, forming the waves of

 

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

 

the lnfinite expanse of ocean. When the Jîva comes to know internally
and becomes thoroughly conscious that all this is Thy work, Thou
createst and destroyest, that all this is Thy Mâyic pastime, false, like
the parts of an actor in a theatrical play, then and then only he
desists for ever from his part in this Theatre of world. O Mother! O
Destroyer of the greatest difficulties! I always take refuge unto Thee.
Thou dost save me from this ocean of Samsâra, full of Moha (delusion).
Let Thou be my Saviour when my end will come, from these infinitely
troublesome and unreal pains arising from love and hatred. Obeisance to
Thee! O Devî! O Mahâ vidyâ! I fall prostrate at Thy feet. O Thou, the
Giver of all desires! O Auspicious One! Dost Thou give the knowledge
that is All-Light to Me.

 

Thus ends the fourth chapter of the Third Skandha on the hymns to the
Great Devî by Vi<u>sn</u>u in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>a S'rîmad Devî
Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâs.
