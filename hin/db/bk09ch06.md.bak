1-10. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- “O Nârada! Sarasvatî lives always in
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha close to Nârada. One day a quarrel arose with Gangâ,
and by Her curse, Sarasvatî came in parts as a river here in this
Bhârata. She is reckoned in Bhârata as a great sanctifiying holy and
merit-giving river. The good persons serve Her always, residing on Her
banks. She is the Tapasyâ and the fruit thereof of the ascetics. She is
like the burning fire to the sins of the sinners. Those that die in
Bhârata on the Sarasvatî waters with their full consciousness, live for
ever in Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha in the council of Hari. Those that bathe in the
Sarasvatî waters, after committing sins, become easily freed of them and
live for a long, long time in Vi<u>sn</u>u-Loka. If one bathes even once
in the Sarasvatî waters, during Châturmâsya (a vow that lasts four
months), in full moon time, in Ak<u>s</u>yayâ or when the day ends, in
Vyatîpâta Yoga, in the time of eclipse or on any other holy day or
through any other concomitant cause or even without any faith and out of
sheer disregard, one is able to go to Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha and get the
nature of S’rî Hari. If one repeats the Sarasvatî Mantra, residing on
the banks of the Sarasvatî, for one month, a great illiterate can become
a great poet. There is no doubt in this. Once shaving one's head, if one
resides on the banks of the Sarasvatî, daily bathes in it, one will have
not to meet with the pain of being again born in the womb. O Nârada!
Thus I have described a little of the unbounded glories of Bhârata that
give happiness and the fruits of all desires.”

11\. Sûta said :-- “O Saunaka! The Muni Nârada hearing thus, asked again
at that very moment to solve his doubts. I am now speaking of that.
Hear.”

 

12-15. Nârada said :-- “O Lord! How did the Devî Sarasvatî quarrel with
the Devî Gangâ and how did she by Her curse turn out in India, into a
holy river in giving virtues. I am becoming more and more eager and
impatient to hear about this critical incident. I do not find satiety in
drinking your nectar-like words. Who finds satiety in getting his good
weal? Why did Gangâ curse Sarasvatî, worshipped everywhere. Gangâ is
also full of Sattva Gu<u>n</u>as. She always bestows good and virtue to
all. Both of them are fiery and it is pleasant to hear the cause of
quarrels between those two. These are very rarely found in the
Purâ<u>n</u>as. So you ought to describe that to me.”

 

16-21. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- Hear, O Nârada! I will now describe that
incident, the hearing of which removes all the sins. Lak<u>s</u>mî,
Sarasvatî and Gangâ, the three wives of Hari and all equally loved,
remain always close to Hari. One day Gangâ cast side-long glances
frequently towards Nârâya<u>n</u>a and was eagerly looking at Him, with
smile on Her lips. Seeing this, the Lord Nârâyana, startled and looked
at Gangâ and smiled also. Lak<u>s</u>mî saw that, but she did not take
any offence. But Sarasvatî became very angry. Padmâ (Lak<u>s</u>mî) who
was of Sattva Gu<u>n</u>a, began to console in various ways the wrathful
Sarasvatî; but she could not be appeased by any means. Rather Her face
became red out of anger; she began to tremble out of her feelings
(passion); Her lips quivered; and She began to speak to Her husband.

 

22-38. The husband that is good, religious, and well qualified looks on
his all the wives equally; but it is just the opposite with him who is a
cheat. O Gadâdhara! You are partial to Gangâ; and so is the case with
Lak<u>s</u>mî. I am the only one that is deprived of your love. It is,
therefore, that Gangâ and Padmâ are in love with each other; for you
love Padmâ. So why shall not Padmâ bear this contrary thing! I am only
unfortunate. What use is there in holding my life? Her life is useless,
who is deprived of her husband's love. Those that declare you, of Sattva
Gu<u>n</u>as, ought not to be ever called Pundits. They are quite
illiterate; they have not the least knowledge of the Vedas. They are
quite impotent to understand the nature of your mind. O Nârada! Hearing
Sarasvatî's words and knowing that she had become very angry,
Nârâya<u>n</u>a thought for a moment and then went away from the Zenana
outside. When Nârâya<u>n</u>a had thus gone away, Sarasvatî became
fearless and began to abuse Gangâ downright out of anger in an abusive
language, hard to hear :-- “O Shameless One! O Passionate One! What

 

<span id="page_828">p. 828</span>

 

pride do you feel for your husband? Do you like to show that your
husband loves you much? I will destroy your pride today. I will see
today, it will be seen by others also, what your Hari can do for you?”
Saying thus Sarasvatî rose up to catch hold of Gangâ by Her hairs
violently. Padmâ intervened to stop this. Sarasvatî became very violent
and cursed Lak<u>s</u>mî :-- “No doubt you will be turned into a tree
and into a river. In as much as seeing this undue behaviour of Gangâ,
you do not step forward to speak anything in this assembly, as if you
are a tree or a river.” Padmâ did not become at all angry, even when she
heard of the above curse. She became sorry and, holding the hands of
Sarasvatî, remained silent. Then Gangâ became very angry; Her lips began
to quiver frequently. Seeing the mad fiery nature of the red-eyed
Sarasvatî, she told Laksmî :-- “O Padme! Leave that wicked foul-mouthed
woman. What will she do to me? She presides over speech and therefore
likes always to remain with quarrels. Let Her shew Her force how far can
she quarrel with me. She wants to test the strength of us. So leave Her.
Let all know today our strength and prowess.”

 

39-44. Thus saying, Gangâ became ready to curse Sarasvatî and addressing
Lak<u>s</u>mî, said :-- “O Dear Padme! As that woman has cursed you to
become a river, so I too curse her, that she, too, be turned into a
river and she would go to the abode of men, the sinners, to the world
and take their heaps of sins.” Hearing this curse of Gangâ, Sarasvatî
gave her curse, “You, too, will have to descend into the Bhurloka (the
world) as a river, taking all the sins of the sinners.” O Nârada! While
there was going on this quarrel, the four-armed omniscient Bhagavân Hari
came up there accompanied by four attendants of His, all four-armed, and
took Sarasvatî in His breast and began to speak all the previous
mysteries. Then they came to know the cause of their quarrels and why
they cursed one another and all became very sorry. At that time Bhagavân
Hari told them one by one :--

 

45-67. O Lak<u>s</u>mî! Let you be born in parts, without being born in
any womb, in the world as the daughter in the house of the King
Dharma-dhvaja. You will have to take the form of a tree there, out of
this evil turn of fate. There S'ankhachû<u>d</u>a, the Indra of the
Asuras, born of my parts will marry you. After that you will come back
here and be my wife as now. There is no doubt in this. You will be named
Tulasî, the purifier of the three worlds, in Bhârata. O Beautiful One!
Now go there quickly and be a river in your parts under the name
Padmâvatî. O Gange! You will also have to take incarnation in Bhârata as
a river, purifying all the worlds, to destroy the sins of

the inhabitants of Bhârata. Bhagiratha will take you there after much
entreating and worshipping you; and you will be famous by the name
Bhagirathî, the most sanctifying river in the world. There, the Ocean
born of my parts, and the King S'ântanu also born of my parts will be
your husbands. O Bharatî! Let you go also and incarnate in part in
Bhârata under the curse of Gangâ. O Good-natured One! Now go in full
Amsas to Brahmâ and become His wife. Let Gangâ go also in Her fullness
to S'iva. Let Padmâ remain with Me. Padmâ is of a peaceful nature, void
of anger, devoted to Me and of a Sâttvika nature. Chaste, good-natured,
fortunate, and religious woman like Padmâ are very rare. Those women
that are born of the parts of Padmâ are all very religious and devoted
to their husbands. They are peaceful and good-natured and worshipped in
every universe. It is forbidden, nay, opposed to the Vedas, to keep
three wives, three servants, three friends of different natures, at one
place. They never conduce to any welfare. They are the fruitful sources
of all jealousies and quarrels. Where, in any family females are
powerful like men and males are submissive to females, the birth of the
male is useless. At his every step, he meets with difficulties and
bitter experiences. He ought to retire to the forest whose wife is
foul-mouthed, of bad birth and fond of quarrels. The great forest is
better for him than his house. That man does not get in his house any
water for washing his feet, or any seat to sit on, or any fruit to eat,
nothing whatsoever; but in the forest, all these are not unavailable.
Rather to dwell amidst rapacious animals or to enter into fire than
remain with a bad wife. O Fair One! Rather the pains of the disease or
venom are bearable, but the words of a bad wife are hard to bear. Death
is far better than that. Those that are under the control of their
wives, know that they never get their peace of mind until they are laid
on their funeral pyres. They never see the fruits of what they daily do.
They have no fame anywhere, neither in this world nor in the next.
Ultimately the fruit is this:-- that they have to go to hell and remain
there. His life is verily a heavy burden who is without any name or
fame. Never it is for the least good that many co-wives remain at one
place. When, by taking one wife only a man does not become happy, then
imagine, how painful it becomes to have many wives. O Gange! Go to
S'iva. O Sarasvatî! Go to Brahmâ. Let the good-natured Kamalâ, residing
on the lotus remain with Me. He gets in this world happiness and Dharma
and in the next Mukti whose wife is chaste and obedient. In fact he is
Mukta, pure and happy whose wife is chaste; and he whose wife is
foul-natured, is rendered impure unhappy and dead whilst he is living.
