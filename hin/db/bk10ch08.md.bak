1\. Saunaka said :-- “O Sûta! You have described the beautiful narrative
of the first Manu Svâyambhuva. Now kindly describe to us the narratives
of other highly energetic Deva-like Manus.”

 

2-3. Sûta said :-- “O Ri<u>s</u>is! The very wise Nârada, well versed in
the knowledge of S’rî Devî, hearing the glorious character of the first
Svâyambhuva Manu, became desirous to hear of the other Manus and asked
the Eternal Nârâya<u>n</u>a :-- O Deva! Now favour me by reciting the
origin and narratives of the other Manus.”

 

4\. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Devar<u>s</u>i! I have already spoken to
you everything regarding the first Manu. He had worshipped the Devî
Bhagavatî, and thus he got his foeless kingdom. You know that then.

 

5-24 Manu had two sons of great prowess, Priyavrata and Uttânapâda. They
governed their kingdoms with fame. The son of this Priyavrata,

of indomitable valour, is known by the wise as the second
Svârochi<u>s</u>a Manu. Dear to all the beings, this Svârochi<u>s</u>a
Manu built his hermitage near the banks of the Kâlindî (the Jumnâ) and
there making an earthen image of the Devî Bhagavatî, worshipped the Devî
with devotion, subsisting on dry leaves and thus practised severe
austerities. Thus he passed his twelve years in that forest; when, at
last, the Devî Bhagavatî, resplendent with brilliance of the thousand
Suns, became visible to him. She got very much pleased with his
devotional stotrams. The Devî, the Saviour of the Devas, and Who was of
good vows, granted to him the sovereignty for one Manvantara. Thus the
Devî became famous by the name Târi<u>n</u>î Jagaddhâtrî. O Nârada!
Thus, by worshipping the Devî Târi<u>n</u>î, Svârochi<u>s</u>a obtained
safely the foeless kingdom. Then establishing the Dharma duly, he
enjoyed his kingdom with his sons; and, when the period of his
manvantara expired, he went to the Heavens. Priyavrata's son named
Uttama became the third Manu. On the banks of the Ganges, be practised
tapasyâ and repeated the Vîja Mantra of Vâgbhava, in a solitary place
for three years and became blessed with the favour of the Devî. With
rapt devotion he sang hymns wholly to the Devî with his mind full; and,
by Her boon, got the foeless kingdom and a continual succession of sons
and grandsons. Thus, enjoying the pleasures of his kingdom and the gifts
of the Yuga Dharma, got in the end, the excellent place, obtained by the
best Râjar<u>s</u>is. A very happy result. Priyavarata's another son
named Tâmasa became the fourth Manu. He practised austerities and
repeated the Kâma Vîja Mantra, the Spiritual Password of Kâma on the
southern banks of the Narmadâ river and worshipped the World Mother. In
the spring and in the autumn he observed the nine nights' vow ( the
Navarâtri) and worshipped the excellent lotus eyed Deves'î and pleased
Her. On obtaining the Devî's favour, he chanted excellent hymns to Her
and made pranâms. There he enjoyed the extensive kingdom without any
fear from any foe or from any other source of danger. He generated, in
the womb of his wife, ten sons, all very powerful and mighty, and then
he departed, to the excellent region in the Heavens.

 

The young brother of Tâmasa, Raivata became the Fifth Manu and practised
austerities on the banks of the Kâlindî (the Jumnâ) and repeated the
Kâma Vîja Mantra, the spiritual password of Kâma, the resort of the
Sâdhakas, capable to give the highest power of speech and to yield all
the Siddhis, and thus he worshipped the Devî. He obtained excellent
heavens, indomitable power, unhampered and capable of all success and a
continual line of sons, grandsons, etc. Then the unrivalled excellent
hero Raivata Manu established the several divisions of Dharma and
enjoying all the worldly pleasures, went to the excellent region of
Indra.

 

Here ends the Eighth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the origin of Manu in
the Mahâpura<u>n</u>am S'ri Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
