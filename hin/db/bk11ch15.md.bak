**On the rules of using the Tripu<u>nd</u>ra and Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra
marks**

 

<span id="page_1091">p. 1091</span>

 

1-10. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- Only the twice born are to take this
Tripu<u>nd</u>ra on the forehead and the other parts of the body after
carefully purifying the ashes by the mantra Agniriti Bhasma, etc. The
Brâhma<u>n</u>s, K<u>s</u>attriyas, and Vais’yas are known as the
twiceborn, (the Dvîjas). So the Dvîjas ought to take daily this
Tripu<u>nd</u>ra with great care. O Brâhma<u>n</u>a! Those who are
purified with the ceremony of the holy thread, are called the Dvîjas.
For these the taking of Tripu<u>nd</u>ra as per S’ruti is very
necessary. Without taking this Vibhûti, any good work done is as it were
not done. There is no doubt in this. Even the japam of Gâyatrî is not
well performed if this Bhasma be not used. O Best of Munis! The Gâyatrî
is the most important and the chief thing of the Brâhma<u>n</u>hood. But
that is not advised if the Tripu<u>nd</u>ra be not taken. O Munis! As
long as the ashes

 

<span id="page_1092">p. 1092</span>

 

born of Agni are not applied on the forehead, one is not entitled to be
initiated in the Gâyatrî Mantra. O Brâhma<u>n</u>! Unless ashes be
applied on the forehead, no one will recognise you as a Brâhma<u>n</u>a.
For this reason I take this holding of the merit-giving Tripu<u>nd</u>ra
as the cause of the Brâhma<u>n</u>hood. I speak this verily unto you,
that he is recognised as a Brâhma<u>n</u>a and literary on whose
forehead there is seen the white ashes purified by the mantra. He is
entitled to the state of a Brâhma<u>n</u>a who is naturally very eager
to collect the ashes as he collects the invaluable gems and jewels.

 

11-20. Those who are not naturally eager to collect the Bhasma as they
are naturally eager to collect gems and jewel, are to be known as
Châ<u>nd</u>âlas in some of their previous births. Those who are not
naturally joyous in holding Tripu<u>nd</u>ra, were verily
Châ<u>nd</u>âlas in their previous births; this I tell you truly very
truly.

 

Those who eat roots and fruits without holding ashes go to the terrible
hells. He who worships S’iva without having Bibhûti on his forehead,
that wretch is a S’iva hater and goes to hell after his death. He who
does not hold Bibhûti is not entitled to any religious act.

 

Without taking Bibhûti, if you make a gift of Tulâ Puru<u>s</u>a made of
gold, you won’t get any fruits. Rather you will have to go to hell!

 

As the Brâhma<u>n</u>as are not to perform their Sandhyâs without their
holy threads, so without this Bibhûti, one ought not also to perform
one’s Sandhyâ.

 

If at times a man by chance has no holy thread, he can do his Sandhyâ by
muttering the Gâyatrî or by fasting. But there is no such rule in
holding Bhasma.

 

If one performs Sandhyâ, without having any Bibhûti, he is liable to
incur a sin; as without holding this Bhasma, no right can come to him to
perform his Sandhyâ.

 

As a man of a lowest caste acts contrary and incurs a sin if he hears
the Veda mantra, so a twice-born incurs a sin if he performs Sandhyâ
without having his Tripu<u>nd</u>ra. The twiceborn must therefore
collect his thoughts with his heart intent on this Tripu<u>nd</u>ra
whether it be according to S’rauta or Smârta method; or in absence
thereof the Laukika Bhasma. Of whatsoever sort is the Bhasma, it is
always pure. In the Sandhyâ and other actions of worship, the twiceborn
ought to be very careful and punctilious in using this Bhasma.

 

<span id="page_1093">p. 1093</span>

 

21-31. No sin can enter into the body of one besmeared with ashes. For
this reason, the Brâhma<u>n</u>as ought always to use ashes with great
care. One is to hold the Tripu<u>nd</u>ra, six Angulas high or greater
by the fore, middle and ring fingers of the right hand. If anybody uses
Tripu<u>nd</u>ra, shining and brilliant, and extending from eye to eye,
he becomes, no doubt, a Rudra. The ring-finger is the letter “A,” the
middle finger is “U” and the forefinger is “M”; so the Tripu<u>nd</u>ra
marks drawn by the above three fingers is of the nature of the three
gu<u>n</u>as. The Tripu<u>nd</u>ra should be drawn by the middle, fore,
and ring fingers in a reverse way (from the left of the forehead to its
right). I will now tell you an anecdote, very ancient. Listen. Once
Durvâsâ, the head of the ascetics, with his body besmeared with ashes
and with Rudrâksam, all over, on his body went to the region of the
Pitris, uttering loudly, “O S’ankara, of the Form of All! O S’iva! O
Mother Jagadambe, the Source of all auspiciousness!” The Pitris
Kavya-Vâlâs, etc., (Kavya Vâlanala<u>h</u> Soma<u>h</u> Yama<u>h</u>
schaivâryamâ Tathâ, Agnisvâttvâ, Varhisada<u>h</u>, Somapâ<u>h</u> Pitri
Devatâh) got up, received him heartily and gave him seats and shewed him
great honours and respect and held many pure conversations with the
Muni. During their talk, the sinners of the Kumbhîpâka hell were crying,
“Oh! Alas! We are killed, we are being killed. Oh! We are being burnt!”
some others cried, “Oh! Oh! We are cut down.” Thus various cries and
lamentations reached their ears.

 

32-40. Hearing their piteous cries, Durvâsâ, the prince of the
Ri<u>s</u>is, asked with a grievous heart the Pitris, “Who are those
crying?” The Pitris replied :-- There is a city close to our place
called “Samyamanî Purî” of the King Yama where the sinners are punished.
Yama gives punishment to the sinners there. O Sinless One! In that city
the King Yama lives with his terrible black-coloured messengers, the
personifications of Kâla (the Destruction). For the punishment of the
sinners, eighty-six hells exist there. The place is being guarded always
by the horrible messengers of Yama. Out of those hells, the hell named
Kumbhîpâka is very big and that is the chief of the hells. The ailings
and torments of the sinners in the Kumbhîpâka hell cannot be described
in hundred years. O Muni! The S’iva-haters, the Vi<u>sn</u>u-haters, the
Devî-haters are made to fall to this Ku<u>nd</u>a. Those who find fault
with the Vedas, and blame the Sun, Ga<u>n</u>es’a and tyrannise the
Brâhma<u>n</u>as fall down to this hell. Those who blame their mothers,
fathers, Gurus, elder brothers, the Smritis and Purâ<u>n</u>as and those
as well who take the Tapta Mudrâs (hot marks on their bodies) and

 

<span id="page_1094">p. 1094</span>

 

Tapta S’ûlas (i.e., those who being S’aivas act as they like) those who
blame the religion (Dharma) go down to that hell.

 

41-50. We hear constantly their loud piteous cries, very painful to
hear; hearing which naturally gives rise to feelings of indifference
(Vairâgyam). Hearing the above words of the Pitris, Durvâsâ, the prince
of the Munis, went to the hell to see the sinners. O Muni! Going there,
the Muni bent his head downwards and saw the sinners when, instantly the
sinners began to enjoy pleasures more than those who enjoy in the
Heavens. The sinners became exceedingly glad. Some began to sing, some
began to dance, some began to laugh; some sinners began to play one with
one another in great ecstasy. The musical instruments Mrida<u>n</u>ga,
Muraja, lute, Dhakkâ, Dundubhis, etc., resounded with sweet sonorous
tones (in accordance with five resonants). The sweet fragrant smell of
the flowers of Vâsanti creepers spread all round. Durvâsâ Muni became
surprised to see all this. The messengers of Yama were startled and
immediately went to their King Yama and said :-- “O Lord! Our King! A
wondrous event occurred lately. The sinners in the Kumbhîpâka hell are
now enjoying pleasures more than those in the Heavens. O Bibhu! How can
this take place! We cannot make out the cause of this. O Deva! We all
have become terrified and have come to you.” Hearing the words of the
messengers, Dharmarâja, mounting on his great buffalo, came there
instantly and seeing the state of the sinners sent news immediately to
the Heavens.

 

51-60. Hearing the news Indra came there with all the Devas, Brahmâ came
there from His Brahmaloka; and Nârâya<u>n</u>a came there from
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha. Hearing this, the regents of the quarters, the
Dikpâlas came there with all their attendants from their respective
abodes. They all came there to the Kumbhîpâka hell and saw that all the
beings there are enjoying greater pleasures than those in the Heavens.
They all were astonished to see this; and they could not make out why
this had happened. “What a wonder is this! This Ku<u>nd</u>a has been
built for the punishment of the sinners. When such a pleasure is now
being felt here, the people won’t fear anything henceforth to commit
sins. Why is this order of the Vedas created by God reversed? Why has
God undone His own doing? What a wonder is this! Now a great miracle is
before our sight.” Thus speaking, they remained at a fix. They could not
make out the cause of this. In the meanwhile Bhagavân Nârâya<u>n</u>a
after consulting with the other Devas went with some Devas to the abode
of

 

<span id="page_1095">p. 1095</span>

 

S’ankara in Kailâs’a. They saw there that S’rî Bhagavân S’ankara (with
crescent of the Moon on His forehead) was playing there attended always
by the Pramathas and adorned with various ornaments like a youth,
sixteen years old. His parts of the body were very beautiful as if the
mine of loveliness. He was conversing on various delightful subjects
with His consort Pârvatî and pleasing Her mind. The four Vedas were
there personified. Seeing Him, Nârâya<u>n</u>a bowed down and informed
him clearly of all the wonderful events. He said :--

 

61-75. “O Deva! What is the cause of all this? We cannot make out
anything! O Lord! Thou art omniscient. Thou knowest everything. So
kindly mention how is this brought about!” Hearing Vi<u>sn</u>u’s words.
Bhagavân S’ankara spoke graciously in sweet words, grave as the rumbling
of a rain-cloud :-- “O Vi<u>sn</u>u! Hear the cause of this. What wonder
is there? This is all due to the greatness of Bhasma (ashes)! What
cannot be brought about by Bhasma! The great S’aiva Durvâsâ went to see
the Kumbhîpâka hell, besmearing his whole body with Bhasma and looked
downwards while he was looking at the sinners. At that time,
accidentally a particle of Bhasma from his forehead was blown by air to
the bodies of the sinners in the hell. Thereby they were freed of their
sins and they got so much pleasure! Such is the greatness of Bhasma!
Henceforth the Kumbhîpâka will no more be a hell. It will be a Tîrtha
(holy place of pilgrimage) of the residents of the Pitrilokas. Whoever
will bathe there will be very happy. There is no doubt in this. Its name
will be henceforth the Pitri Tîrtha.

 

O Sattama! My Lingam and the form of Bhagavatî ought to be placed there.
The inhabitants of the Pitri Loka would worship them. This will be the
best of all the Tîrthas extant in the three Lokas. And if the
Pitris’varî there be worshipped, know that the worship of the Trilokî is
done. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- Hearing thus the words of S’ankara, the
Deva of the Devas, He thanked Him and, taking His permission came to the
Devas and informed them of everything what S’ankara had said. Hearing
this, the Devas nodded their heads and said, “Sadhu (well, very well)”
and began to glorify the greatness of Bhasma. O Tormenter of the
enemies! Hari, Brahmâ and the other Devas began to eulogise the glories
of ashes. The Pitris became very glad to get a new Tîrtha. The Devas
planted a S’iva Lingam and the form of the Devî on the banks of the new
Tîrtha, and began to worship them regularly day by day. The sinners that
were there suffering, all ascended on the celestial chariot and got up
to Kailâs’a. Even today they are

 

<span id="page_1096">p. 1096</span>

 

all dwelling in Kailâs’a and are known by the name of the Bhadras. The
hell Kumbhîpâka came to be built afterwards in another place.

 

76-84. Since that day the Devas did not allow any other devotee of S’iva
to go to the newly created hell Kumbhîpâka. Thus I have described to you
the excellent greatness of the Bhasma. O Muni! What more can there be
than the glories of the Bhasma! O Best of Munis! Now I am telling you of
the usage of Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra (the vertical marks) according to the
proper province of the devotees. Listen. I will now speak what I have
ascertained from the study of the Vai<u>sn</u>ava S’âstras, the measure
of Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra, according to the Anguli measurements, the colour,
mantra, Devatâ and the fruits thereof. Hear. The earth required is to be
seen red from the crests of hills, the banks of the rivers, the place of
S’iva (S’iva K<u>s</u>ettram), the ocean beaches, the ant-hill, or from
the roots of the Tulasî plants. The earth is not to be had from any
other places. The black coloured earth brings in peace, the red-colour
earth brings in powers to bring another to one’s control; the
yellow-coloured earth increases prosperity and the white-coloured earth
gives Dharma (religion). If the Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra be drawn by the
thumb, nourishment is obtained; if it be drawn by the middle finger,
longevity is increased; if it be drawn by nameless or ring finger, food
is obtained and if it be drawn by the fore finger, liberation is
attained. So the Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ras ought to be drawn by these fingers,
only be careful to see that the nails do not touch at the time of making
the mark. The shape of the Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra (the vertical mark or sign
on the fore-head) is like a flame or like the opening bud of a lotus, or
like the leaf of a bamboo, or like a fish, or like a tortoise or like a
conch-shell.

 

85-95. The Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra, ten Angulis high is the super best; nine
Angulis high, is best; eight Angulis high, is good; the middling
Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra is of three kinds as it is of seven Angulas, six
Angulas, or five Angulas. The lowest Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra is again of
three kinds as it is four Angulas, three Angulas or two Angulas high. On
the Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra of the forehead, you must meditate Kes’ava, on
the belly you must think of Nârâya<u>n</u>a; on the heart, you must
meditate on Mâdhava; and on the neck, you must meditate on Govinda. So
on the right side of the belly, you must meditate on Madhûsûdana; on the
roots of the ears, on Trivikrama; on the left belly, on Vâmana; on the
arms, on S’rîdhara; on the ears, Hri<u>s</u>îkes’a; on the back,
Padmanâbha; on the shoulders Dâmodara; and on the head Brahmarandhra you
must meditate on Vâsudeva. Thus the twelve

 

<span id="page_1097">p. 1097</span>

 

names are to be meditated. In the morning or in the evening time when
you are going to make the Pûjâ or Homa, you are to take duly,
single-in-intent, the above names and make the marks of
Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ras. Any man, with Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra on his head, is
always pure, whether he be impure, or of unrighteous conduct or whether
he commits a sin mentally. Wherever he dies, he comes to My Abode even
if he be of a Châ<u>nd</u>âla caste. My devotees ( Vîra Vai<u>sn</u>avas
or Mahâvîra Vai<u>sn</u>avas) who know My Nature must keep an empty
space between the two lines of Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra of the form of the
Vi<u>sn</u>upada (the feet of Vi<u>sn</u>u) and those who are my best
devotees are to use nice Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ras, made of turmeric powder,
of the size of a spear (S’ûla), of the form of the feet of Vi<u>sn</u>u
(Vi<u>sn</u>u padah).

 

96\. The ordinary Vai<u>sn</u>avas are to use with Bhakti, the
Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ras without any empty space, but the form of it is to be
like a flame, the blossom of a lily or like a bamboo leaf.

 

97-110. Those who are Vai<u>sn</u>avas in name only can use
Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra of both the kinds, with or without any empty space.
They incur no sin if they use one without an empty space. But those who
are My good devotees, incur sin if they do not keep an empty space
between the two vertical lines (in the Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra three vertical
lines are used). The Vai<u>sn</u>avas who use excellent vertical rod
like Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ras keeping an empty space in the middle and
uttering the mantra “Kesvâya Nama<u>h</u>” build My Temple there. In the
beautiful middle space of Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra, the Undecaying
Vi<u>sn</u>u is playing with Lak<u>s</u>mî. That wretch, the twice-born
who uses Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra without any empty apace kills Vi<u>sn</u>u
and Lak<u>s</u>mî, seated there. The stupid who uses Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra
without a vacant space goes successively to twenty-one hells. The
Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra should be of the size of a clear straight rod, lotus,
flame, a fish with sharp straight edges and with vacant spaces between
them. O Great Muni! The Brâhma<u>n</u>a should always use the
Tripu<u>nd</u>ra like the lock of hair on the crown of his head and like
his Sacrificial thread; otherwise all his actions will be fruitless.
Therefore in all ceremonies and actions the Brâhma<u>n</u>as ought to
use Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ras of the form of a trident, a circle or of a
square form. The Brâhma<u>n</u>a who knows the Vedas is never to use the
semi-moonlike mark (Tilak) on his bead. The man who is of the
Brâhmi<u>n</u> caste and follows the path of the Vedas should not even
by mistake use any other mark than those above-mentioned. Other sorts of
pu<u>nd</u>ras (marks) that are mentioned in other Vai<u>sn</u>ava
S’âstras for the attainment of fame, beauty, etc., the Veda-knowing
Brâhma<u>n</u>as should not use them. The Vaidik Brâhma<u>n</u>as should
not use even in error any other Tilaks than the curved Tripu<u>nd</u>ras

 

1098}

 

If, out of delusion, the man, following the path of the Vedas, uses
other sorts of Tripu<u>nd</u>ras, he would certainly go down to hell.

 

111-118. The Veda-knowing Brâhma<u>n</u>as would certainly go down to
hell if they use other sorts of Tripu<u>nd</u>ras on their bodies. Only
the Tilakas, prescribed in the Vedas ought to be used by those who are
devoted to the Vedas. Those who do not observe the duties of the Vedas
would use Tilaks approved of by other S’âstras. Those should use marks
approved of by the Vedas whose Deity is that of the Vedas. Those who
follow the Tantra S’âstras different from the Vedas, should use marks
approved of by the Tantras.

 

Mahâ Deva is the Veda’s Deity and, ready to deliver from the bondages of
the world, He has prescribed the Tilakas prescribed in the Vedas for the
benefit of the devotees. The marks prescribed by Vi<u>sn</u>u, also a
Deity of the Vedas, are also those of the Vedas. His other Avataras also
use marks approved of by the Vedas. The Tripu<u>nd</u>ras and the
besmearing of the body with ashes are according to the Vedas. In the
Tantra S’âstra different from the Vedas, there is the usage of
Tripu<u>nd</u>ra and other marks. But they are not to be used by the
Vaidiks. No never.

 

Those who follow the path of the Vedas should use the curved
Tripu<u>nd</u>ras and Bhasma on their foreheads according to the rules
prescribed in the Vedas.

 

He who has obtained the highest state of Nârâya<u>n</u>a, i.e., who has
realised My Nature, ought to use always on their foreheads S’ûla marks
scented with fragrant sandalpaste.

 

Here ends the Fifteenth Chapter of the Eleventh Book on the rules of
using the Tripu<u>nd</u>ra and Ûrdhapu<u>nd</u>ra marks in the
Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
