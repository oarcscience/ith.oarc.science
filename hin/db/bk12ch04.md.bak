**On Gâyatrî Hridaya**

 

<span id="page_1143">p. 1143</span>

 

1-2. Nârada said :-- O Bhagavân! I have heard from you all about the
Kavacha and the Mantra of S’rî Gâyatrî. O Deva Deva! O Thou, the Knower
of the present, the past, and the future! Now tell about the Hridaya,
the highest, the interior or esoteric Essence of the Gâyatrî, holding
which, if one repeats the Gâyatrî, he acquires all the pu<u>n</u>yam
(merits), I am desirous to hear this.

 

3-8. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! This subject on the Hridaya of
Gâyatrî is explicitly written in the Atharva Veda. Now I will speak on
that, the great secret, in detail. Listen. First, consider the Gâyatrî,
the Devî, the Mother of the Vedas as of a Cosmic Form (Virâ
<u>t</u>rupâ) and meditate all the Devas as residing on Her Body. Now in
as much as the Pi<u>nd</u>a and Brahmâ<u>nd</u>a are similar, consider
yourself as of the form of the Devî and meditate within yourself on the
Devatâs, thus :-- The Pundits, the Knowers of the Vedas, say this :-- He
is not yet fit to worship the Deva and he is not an Adhikârî as yet who
has not been able to make himself a Deva; therefore to establish the
knowledge of the oneness of the Deva and himself, he is to meditate the
Devas within his body, thus :--

 

O Nârada! Now I will speak on the Hridaya of Gâyatrî, knowing which
every man becomes able to become all the Devas. Listen. The Ri<u>s</u>i
of this Gâyatrî Hridaya is Nârâya<u>n</u>a; the Chhandas is Gâyatrî; and
S’rî Parames'varî Gâyatrî is the Devatâ. Perform the Nyâsa of this as
mentioned before and taking your seat in a lonely place, meditate
intently on the Devî with your heart and head well collected. Now I am
speaking of the Arthanyâsa. Hear. Meditate on the Devatâ Dyau on your
head; the twin As'vins on the rows of the teeth; the two Sandhyâs on
your upper and lower lips; the Agni, Fire, within your mouth; Sarasvatî,
on the tongue; Brihaspati on the neck; the eight Vasus on the two
breasts; the Vâyus, on the two arms; the Paryanya Deva on the heart;
Âkâs'a, on the belly; Antarîk<u>s</u>am (the middle space) on the navel;
Indra and Agni, on the loins; Prajâpati, the condensed form, as it were,
of Vijñâna, on the hip joints; the Kailâs'a and the Malaya mountains on
the two thighs; the Visvedevâs on the two knees; Vis'vâmitra on the
shanks; the Sun's northern and southern paths, the Uttarâyana and
Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>âyana

on the anus; the Pitris on the thighs; the Earth on the legs; the
Vanaspati on the fingers and toes; the Ri<u>s</u>is on the hairs of the
body; the Muhûrtas on the nails; the planets on the bones; the Ritus
(seasons) on the blood and flesh; the Samvatsaras on the Nimi<u>s</u>a
(twinkling of eye) the Sun and the Moon on the day and night
respectively. Thinking thus, repeat “I take refuge of the Divine Holy
Gâyatrî, the Chief and most Excellent One, the Thousand eyed and I take
refuge wholly unto Her.”

 

Then repeat “I bow down to Tat savitur vare<u>n</u>yam,” “I bow down to
the Rising Sun on the East,” “I bow down to the Morning Aditya,” “I bow
down to the Gâyatrî, residing in the Morning Sun” and “I bow down to
all.” O Nârada! Whoever recites this Gâyatrî Hridaya in the morning
finds all the sins committed in the night all destroyed! Whoever recites
this in the evening gets his sins of the day all destroyed! Whoever
recites this in the evening and in the morning can rest assured to have
become free of sins; he gets the fruits of all the Tîrthas; he is
acquainted with all the Devas; he is saved if he has spoken anything
that ought not to have been spoken; if he has eaten anything that is not
fit to be eaten; if he has chewn and sucked anything that ought not to
have been chewn and sucked; if he has done anything that ought not to
have been done and if he has accepted hundreds and thousands of gifts
that ought never to have been accepted.

 

The sins incurred by eating with the others in a line cannot touch him.
If he speaks lies, he will not be touched by the sins thereof; even if a
non-Brahmachâri recites this, he will become a Brahmachârî. O Nârada!
What more shall I say to you of the results of Gâyatrî Hridaya than this
:-- that whoever will study this will acquire the fruits of performing
thousand sacrifices and repeating the Gâyatrî sixty thousand times. In
fact, he will get Siddhi by this. The Brâhmâ<u>n</u>a, who daily reads
this in the morning will be freed of all the sins and go upwards to the
Brahmâ (Loka) and is glorified there. This has been uttered by Bhagavân
Nârâya<u>n</u>a Himself.

 

Here ends the Fourth Chapter of the Twelfth Book on Gâyatrî Hridaya in
the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
