<span id="page_564">p. 564</span>

 

1\. Vyâsa said :-- O King! That powerful son of Lak<u>s</u>mî, Haihaya,
became very glad to hear these words of Yas’ovatî and said :--

 

2-14. O One of beautiful thighs! Hear in reply to your query :-- I am
Haihaya, the son of Lak<u>s</u>mî, and I am known in this world by the
name of Ekavîra. Now you have made my mind dependent. What am I to do
now? where to go? Thus distressed with bereavement from your dear
companion, my mind is struck with Cupid’s arrows and is confounded with
her extraordinary beauty that you just now described. Next you described
her qualifications and my mind is ravished. Again when you described
before me what she uttered in the presence of the Râk<u>s</u>asa, I am
struck with great wonder. Your dear companion Ekâvalî said before the
vicious Dânava Kâlaketu, “I have already selected the King Haihaya. I
will not select any other than him, this is my firm resolve.” These
words have converted me into her slave. O sweet-haired One! Say now what
service can I do to you both? I am not acquainted with that wicked
demon’s palace; never I went to his city. O Fair-eyed One! Say how I can
go there; for you are the only one that can lead me there. Therefore
take me quickly to that place where your beautiful clear companion is
staying. Your dear companion, the daughter of the King is very much
afflicted with sorrow; soon I will free her, by destroying that cruel
Râk<u>s</u>asa. There is no doubt in this. O Auspicious One! I will
rescue your dear companion and bring her to the city of yours and hand
her over to the hands of her father. Then that King, the enemy
destroyer, will perform the marriage ceremony of his daugther. I think
this is the desire of your heart. O Sweet-speaking One! Know that that
is also my desire. O Beautiful One! Now that desire will be fulfilled by
your efforts. Show me quickly that place and see my prowess. O One with
a face beautiful like the Moon! It seems that you will be able to do my
work. Soon do such as I can kill that wicked demon, who steals others’
wives. Now show me the way to the impassable city of that
Râk<u>s</u>asa.

 

15-26. Vyâsa said :--O King! Hearing the sweet words of the prince,
Yas’ovatî became very glad and gently began to speak out how he could go
to the demon’s city. O King! Take the success-giving Mantra of Bhagavatî
and I would then be able to show you today the city guarded by the
Râk<u>s</u>asas. O King! Better arrange to take your vast

army with you; for you will have to fight no sooner you go there.
Kâlaketu is personally a great warrior surrounded by Râk<u>s</u>asas of
great power and strength. Therefore be initiated in the Mantram of S’rî
Bhagavatî and accompany me. So you will surely be successful. I will
show you the way to the city of that Demon. Slay that vicious and vilest
of the Râk<u>s</u>asas and rescue my dear companion. Hearing thus,
Haihaya was duly initiated into the great Mantram of Yoges’varî, named
Trilokitilaka Mantra (Hrîm Gaurî Rudradayite Yoge S’varî Hûm Pha<u>t</u>
Svâhâ is the Yoges’varî Mantra), by Mahar<u>s</u>i Dattâtreya,
accidentally come there (as if ordained by Fate), the chief of Jñânins
(the Gnostics), that is conducive to the welfare of the beings. Thus by
the influence of the Mantram the King got the power of knowing all
things and going everywhere with unobstructed speed. Then the King
Haihaya quickly went with Yas’ovatî to the impassable city of the
Râk<u>s</u>asas, accompanied by a vast army. The city was surrounded by
snakes and guarded by the terrible Râk<u>s</u>asas like the city of
Pâtâla. The messengers of the Râk<u>s</u>asa, seeing the King coming,
were struck with terror and crying aloud quickly went to Kâlaketu.
Kâlaketu, struck with Cupid’s arrows, was sitting beside Ekâvalî and was
speaking many modest words when the messenger went there suddenly and
said :-- “O King! The attendant of this lady Yas’ovatî is coming here
with a prince and an army.

 

27-29. O King! We cannot tell exactly whether the prince is the son of
Indra, named Jayanta or Kârtikeya. After all, puffed up with the
strength of his army, he is coming here. O King! The battle is imminent;
now make your arrangements fully and carefully; fight with the son of a
Deva or abandon this lotus-eyed Lady. O King! At a distance of three
Yojanas from this place, be is staying with his army. Now equip yourself
and quickly declare the war by blowing the war trumpets.”

 

30-36. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing the messenger’s words, Kâlaketu,
the King of the Demons, became overwhelmed with anger and at once sent
many powerful Râk<u>s</u>asas, holding all sorts of weapons and spoke
out to them :-- “O Râk<u>s</u>asas! With weapons in your hands, go
before them quickly.” Ordering them thus, Kâlaketu asked in sweet words
Ekâvalî who was in front and very distressed. O Thin-bellied One! Who is
coming here? Is he your father or any other man coming with his army to
release you. Speak this to me truly. If your father comes here to take
you back, being very much distressed with your bereavement, I will never
fight with him, if I come to know this truly; rather I will bring him to
my house and worship him with the excel-

lent horses, gems and jewels and clothings. Really I will show my full
hospitality duly to him when he comes here. And if any other person
comes, then I will take his life by the sharpened arrows; there is no
doubt in this. Know this as certain whoever comes here for your rescue
is brought by the hand of Death to me. Therefore, O Large-eyed One! Say
who is this fool that is coming, not knowing me as the powerful and
unconquerable Kâla (Death).

 

37-38. Ekâvalî said :-- “O Highly Fortunate One! I do not know who is
this body coming to this side with a violent speed. O King! How can I
know that when I am in this state of confinement in your house. This man
is not my father nor my brother. Some other powerful man is coming here.
I do not know exactly what for he is coming.”

 

39-40. The Demon said :-- My messengers say that your comrade Yas’ovatî
has taken with her that warrior and is coming to this side with great
energy. Where has your clever companion gone now? O Lotus-eyed! There is
no enemy in the three worlds strong enough to fight against me.

 

41-66. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Just then other messengers hurriedly came
there terrified and spoke to Kâlaketu who had been staying in the house,
thus :-- “O King! The army has come quite close to the city and how are
you staying in the house, calm and quiet? Better march out of the city
with your vast army as early as possible.” The powerful Kâlaketu, then,
hearing their words, mounted on the chariot and quickly went out of his
city. The King Haihaya, on the other hand, suffering from the
bereavements of his dear lady, suddenly came there mounted on horseback.
The terrible fight ensued then and there between the two and each one
struck the other with sharpened weapons and the quarters all around
blazed with their glitterings and clashings. When the terrible fight was
going on, Haihaya, the son of Lak<u>s</u>mî, struck Kâlaketu, the King
of the Daityas with a very powerful club (Gadâ). Thus struck by the
Gadâ, the Lord of the Daityas fell on the ground like a mountain, struck
by lightning, and died. All the Râk<u>s</u>asas fled away on all sides,
struck with terror. Yas’ovatî went then very hurriedly with a gladdened
heart to Ekâvalî and began to speak to her in terms of surprise and in
sweet words :-- O Dear! O Dear! Come, Come; the great warrior, the
prince Ekavîra has killed the Lord of the Daityas in a dreadful battle.
That King is now waiting, tired in the midst of his soldiers. He has
already heard from me about your beauty and qualities; and now he is
expecting to see you. O One Looking askance! Now satisfy your eyes and
mind by seeing that King who is like the Cupid. When

I described to him before on the banks of the Ganges your beauty and
qualifications, he got enamoured of you and now he is suffering from
bereavements and wants to see you. Thus, hearing, Ekâvalî determined to
go to him and as she was yet unmarried, she became abashed and afraid.
She thought how could she see the prince as she was unmarried. It might
be that he being passionate would catch her by her arms. Thus, troubled
with thought, that daughter of the King, with a sad look, and wearing
poor clothes, Ekâvalî went with Yas’ovatî on a palanquin, carried on
men’s shoulders. Seeing that large-eyed daughter of the King coming
there, the prince said :-- “O Beautiful One! My two eyes are very
thirsty to see you. Satisfy my eyes and mind by showing yourself to me.”
Seeing the prince passionate and the King’s daughter very much abashed,
Yas’ovatî, who knew the rules of modesty, thus spoke to the prince :-- “
O Prince! The father of my dear companion expressed a desire to betroth
her to your hands. She is also obedient to you. Therefore your meeting
will certainly take place. O King! Wait; take her to her father; and he
will perform duly the marriage ceremony and betroth her to your hands.
Know this to be quite certain.” The King took her words to be quite just
and true and taking those two ladies went with his army to the house of
the father of Ekâvalî. Ekâvalî’s father became very glad and cheerful to
learn that his daughter was coming and, accompanied by his ministers,
went hurriedly to her. After a long time the King saw his daughter in
poor clothings and became highly pleased. Yas’ovatî then described in
detail all what happened before the King. The King then with his
minister brought with great love, courtesy and gentleness Ekavîra to his
house and on an auspicious day performed the marriage ceremony of him
with Ekâvalî, in accordance with due ceremonies and rites. Then the King
gave away many clothings, ornaments, jewels, and articles for fitting a
house and many other things and worshipped duly and sent his daughter
together with Yas’ovatî away with the King Haihaya. Thus the marriage
ceremony was performed and the son of Lak<u>s</u>mî gladly returned to
his house and began to enjoy many pleasures with his wife. Then, in
course of time, in the womb of Ekâvalî the King Haihaya got a son named
Kritavîrya. The son of this Kritavîrya is known as Kârtavîrya. O King!
Thus I have narrated to you the origin of the Haihaya dynasty.

 

Here ends the Twenty-third Chapter in the Sixth Book on the battle of
Haihaya and Kâlaketu in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam
by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
