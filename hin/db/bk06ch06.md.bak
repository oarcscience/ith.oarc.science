1-3. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus getting the boons from the Devî, the
Devas and the Ri<u>s</u>is blazing with their asceticism, all united and
consulted with each other; then they went to the excellent Âs'rama of
V<u>r</u>itra. There they saw V<u>r</u>itra in a sitting posture and
with his own Tejas (fiery spirit in him) as if ready to burn the three
worlds and to devour all the Devas. The Ri<u>s</u>is, then, spoke to
V<u>r</u>itra the sweet words full of sentiments for the serving of the
Devas' ends, according to the principle of conciliation.

 

4-23. “O highly fortunate V<u>r</u>itra! Terrific to all the Lokas! Yo
have now established your dominion in all the places over this whole
Universe; but your enmity with Indra is the only cause to interrupt you
in your happiness; there is no doubt in this. This enmity has increased
much the anxiety of you both and therefore has grown very painful.
Neither you nor Indra can go to sleep peacefully, there is always that
fear hanging on you both, on account of that enmity. And, see! A long
long while has passed away since the last battle was fought between you
two; yet all the Devas, Asuras, men and other subjects, are feeling a
sense

of oppression and pain. In this world happiness is the only thing to be
sought for and pain is to be avoided; this is the eternal state of
things. Never does that man who practises enmity with another, get
happiness; this has been ascertained by the wise. It is only those brave
warriors, that found taste in warfare, that approve of battles; but the
wise that are expert in amorous enjoyments do not like battle as
destroying the sensual enjoyments; they do not like fighting with
flowers even; what to say with sharpened arrows! In a battle, the
victory is doubtful but the shooting of arrows is certain, This world is
dependent on Fate (Daiva, i.e., dependent on the cosmic rulers or
deities or Devas of the Universe), so is victory or defeat. So knowing
this, one ought never to fight. Bathing in proper time, taking food and
sleeping in fixed times and having a chaste serving wife, these are the
means towards happiness in this world. While in warfares, shooting
terrible arrows and striking with fierce axes take place; what happiness
can there possibly exist? Rather the enemy finds pleasure there. There
is a saying that death in battles leads one to Heaven, but this is
merely an enticing statement, inciting one to war! Really it is
fruitless. Supposing that happiness comes ultimately to those who pain
their bodies by being shot with arrows and who allow their carcasses
being devoured by the crows and jackals, then no man, even of dull
understanding, will like this, what to speak of intelligent persons!
Therefore, O V<u>r</u>itra! Let everlasting peace and friendship be
established between you and Indra; both of you in that case will derive
everlasting peace and happiness. Moreover if the enmity between you
terminates from this instant, then we, the ascetics and Gandharbas will,
no doubt, be able to remain in our own respective Âs'rams with great
comfort. O Powerful Hero! Owing to incessant wars between you and Indra,
the Munis, Gandharbas, Kinnaras and beings are day and night, suffering
very much. For the happiness of all peace-loving persons, we, the Munis,
the residents of the forest, earnestly desire that there be formed
friendship between you two. We desire that you, Indra and all the Jîvas
get happiness. O V<u>r</u>itra! We stand as mediators in this treaty
between you and Indra; we will make each party swear on oath and thus
make it conducive to the happiness of both. Indra will now swear on oath
before you on the terms that you will dictate and thus will make your
heart cheerful. Know this verily that this earth stands on Truth, the
sun rises for the sake of Truth, the winds blow all along for Truth and
the boundless ocean never oversteps its limit for Truth. Therefore let
your friendship, be established on Truth. Thus tied together by bonds of
friendship let you two sleep, play, make sports in water and sit
together happily.”

24-28. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing the Mahar<u>s</u>i's words, the
highly intelligent V<u>r</u>itra began to say :-- “Risis! You are
possessed with knowledge and many other qualifications and you are
ascetics; you are therefore to be respected by me. You are the Munis and
therefore you never speak anywhere falsehood; your conduct is good and
you practise rite and ceremonies; you are calm; therefore you do not
know the causes of pretexts. The intelligent should never cultivate
friendship with a knave, licentious person who is void of understanding,
an infamous, and a shameless person, specially if he be an enemy. This
vicious Indra is shameless, deceitful, licentious, and the killer of a
Brâhma<u>n</u>a; therefore no faith can ever be placed on such persons.
You are saints and added with all good qualifications; therefore your
minds never play in the mischievous thoughts of others; it is because
your heart is calm and quiet that you cannot understand the minds of the
deceitful and treacherous; therefore you ought never to stand as
mediators between any two persons.”

 

29-32. The Munis said :-- “O King! All the creatures certainly enjoy the
fruits of their Karmas, whether good or bad; how then, can persons, of
perverted intellect, obtain peace when they do mischief to others. The
treacherous persons certainly go to hell and suffer miseries always. The
slayers of Brâhma<u>n</u>as and the drunkards may get liberation; but
never the faithless and those who go against their friends get off free;
these will have to suffer undoubtedly in the hells. Therefore, O Knower
of all things! Give out clearly what is going on exactly in your mind
and the exact terms that you want; and the treaty will be made between
you and Indra exactly according to those terms.”

 

33-34. V<u>r</u>itra said :-- “O highly fortunate Munis! I can enter
into a treaty of peace with Indra only on the condition that Indra with
all the other Devas will not kill me in day or in night with any dry or
liquid substance or with wood, stone, or thunderbolt and on no other
terms.”

 

35-68. Vyâsa said :-- O King! The Ri<u>s</u>is then gladly accepted his
word and brought Indra there and recited to him the terms of the treaty
of peace. Indra, then, swore, an oath, before the Munis with Fire as the
Witness that he would comply with the terms of the treaty, and was thus
freed from his heavy thoughts and felt that he had been rid of a fever.
V<u>r</u>itra, then, relied on lndra's words; became his friend, and
began live, play and enjoy with him. They felt pleasure by their union
and began to roam sometimes in the Nandana Garden, sometimes in the
Gandha Mâdana, sometimes on the shores of oceans, V<u>r</u>itra was very
much delighted when they were thus united in friendship; but Indra
watched

him to find his faults; thus sometime passed. A few years passed away
after the treaty had been concluded. And the straight-forward
V<u>r</u>itra began to place very much confidence on Indra; but Indra
meditated on the means how to kill him. One day Visvakarmâ, knowing that
his son V<u>r</u>itrâsura placed implicit confidence on Indra, called
his son and said :-- “O my son V<u>r</u>itra! Hear my good words. See,
it is never advisable to trust anybody with whom there has arisen once
the enmity. Indra is your greatest enemy; he always intends evil to you;
therefore do not trust him any more. Indra is never to be trusted, who
is always covetous, inimical, rejoicing at others sufferings, licentious
and addicted to others' wives; vicious, deceitful, finding faults with
others, always jealous, a juggler, and puffed up with vanity. O Child! 
What more shall I say than this fact that that villain, without fearing
sin, easily entered into the womb of his mother and cut the crying child
in the womb into seven pieces and then each seventh part again into
seven parts, thus altogether into forty-nine parts. Therefore O my son!
He is never to be trusted on any account. He who is always addicted to
vicious deeds never feels shame in perpetrating again another crime.”
Vyâsa said :-- O King! V<u>r</u>itra's death time drew nigh; hence he
could not take his father's words as auspicious, though he was warned by
his father in words full of meaning. One day, in the evening time, at a
very inauspicious dreadful moment, Indra saw V<u>r</u>itra on the shore
of an ocean and began to think of the boon granted by Brahmâ to the
Asura thus :-- “Now this is the terrible evening time; this cannot be
called day nor can it be called night, and this demon is also here alone
in this solitary place; it is advisable therefore to effect his death by
force, there is no doubt in this.” Thus arguing in his mind, Indra
remembered the Undecaying Soul Hari. Bhagavân, the Best of
Puru<u>s</u>as came there, unseen by anybody, and entered into the
thunderbolt; Indra quickly collected himself to kill V<u>r</u>itrâsura;
but he thought how he could slay this Demon, unconquerable in the
battle; and if he did not slay his enemy then by deceit, then his enemy
would continue to live, and it would be impossible for him to get his
own welfare. While he was thus thinking, he saw the foam of the waters
of the ocean as big as a mountain; thinking that foam not to be dry nor
wet and considering that foam not to be any weapon, he easily took that
foam and instantly remembered with a heartful devotion the Highest Force
Bhuvanes'varî. On Her remembrance, the Bhagavatî infused Her part into
that foam and the thunderbolt, instilled with the force of Nârâyana, was
covered, too, by that foam. Indra, then, hurled the thunderbolt covered
with foam on V<u>r</u>itra; and the Demon, thus struck, instantly fell
down like a mountain. When V<u>r</u>itrâsura was thus killed, Indra
became very glad; the Ri<u>s</u>is began to praise

 

<span id="page_503">p. 503</span>

 

him with various hymns. Indra, then, with all the other Devas worshipped
the Devî, through Whose Grace the enemy had been killed and they praised
Her with various hymns. The image of the Bhagavatî the Supreme S'akti
was built of ruby and installed in the Nandana Garden. O King! Since
then all the Devas used to worship the Devî thrice a day, morning,
midday and evening and since then the       S'rî Devî became the
tutelary deity of the Gods. Indra worshipped then Vi<u>sn</u>u also, the
Highest of the Gods. When the terrible powerful V<u>r</u>itrâsura was
killed, the auspicious wind began to blow gently; the Devas, Gandharbas,
Râkhsasas, and Kinnaras began to roam about with great joy.
V<u>r</u>itrâsura was deluded by the Mâyâ of Bhagavatî, and Her force
entered into the foam; hence Indra was capable to kill him suddenly and
it is, for this reason, that the Devî, the Goddess of the world, is
known in the three worlds as “V<u>r</u>itranihantrî,” the slayer of
V<u>r</u>itra. But at the first sight Indra killed him by means of the
foam; hence the people say that V<u>r</u>itra was killed by Indra.

 

Here ends the Sixth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the slaying of
V<u>r</u>itrâsura in the Mahapurâ<u>n</u>am S'rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of
18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
