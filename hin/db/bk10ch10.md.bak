1-4. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- Now the Seventh Manu is the Right Hon'ble
His Excellency the Lord Vaivasvata Manu S'râddha Deva, honoured by all
the kings, and the Enjoyer of the Highest Bliss, Brahmânan<u>d</u>a. I
will now speak of this seventh Manu. He, too, practised austerities
before the Highest Devî and by Her Grace, got the sovereignty of the
earth for one Manvantara.

 

The Eighth Manu is the Sun's son, known as Sâvar<u>n</u>i. This
personage, a devotee of the Devî, honoured by the kings, gentle, patient
and powerful king Sâvar<u>n</u>i worshipped the Devî in his previous
births and, by Her boon, became the Lord of the Manvantara.

 

5\. Nârada said :-- O Bhagavân! How did this Sâvar<u>n</u>i Manu worship
in his previous birth the earthen image of the Devî. Kindly describe
this to me.

 

6-13. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! This Eighth Manu had been,
before, in the time of Svârochi<u>s</u>a Manu (the second Manu), a
famous king, known by the name of Suratha, born of the family of
Chaitra, and very powerful. He could well appreciate merits, clever in
the science of archery, amassed abundance of wealth, a generous donor, a
very liberal man and he was a celebrated poet and honoured by all. He
was skilled in all arts of warfare with weapons and indomitable in
crushing his foes. Once on a time, some of his powerful enemies
destroyed the city of Kolâ, belonging to the revered king and succeeded
in besieging his capital wherein he remained. Then the king Suratha, the
conqueror of all his foes went out to fight with the enemies but he was
defeated by them. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the king's
ministers robbed him of all his wealth. The illustrious king then went
out of the city and with a sorrowful heart rode alone on his horse on
the plea of having a game and walked to and fro, as if, absent-minded.

 

14-25. The king, then, went to the hermitage of the Muni Sumedhâ, who
could see far-reaching things (a Man of the Fourth Dimension). It was a
nice, quiet Âs'rama, surrounded by quiet and peaceful animals and filled
with disciples. There in that very sacred Âs'rama, his heart became
relieved and he went on living there.

 

One day, when the Muni finished his worship, etc., the king went to him
and saluted him duly and humbly asked him the following :-- “O Muni! I
am suffering terribly from my mental pain. O Deva on the earth! Why I am
suffering so much though I know everything, as if I am quite an ignorant
man. After my defeat from my enemies, why does my mind become now

compassionate towards those who stole away my kingdom. O Best of the
knowers of the Vedas! What am I to do now? Where to go? How can I make
me happy? Please speak on these. O Muni! Now I am in want of your good
grace.” The Muni said :-- “O Lord of the earth! Hear the extremely
wonderful glories of the Devî that have no equal and that can fructify
all desires. She, the Mahâ Mâyâ, Who is all this world, is the Mother of
Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u and Mahes'a. O King! Know verily that it is She and
She alone, that can forcibly attract the hearts of all the Jîvas and
throw them in dire utter delusion. She is always the Creatrix,
Preservrix and Destructrix of the Universe in the form of Hara. This
Mahâ Mâyâ fulfills the desires of all the Jîvas and She is known as the
insurmountable Kâlarâtri. She is Kâlî, the Destructrix of all this
universe and She is Kamalâ residing in the lotus. Know that this whole
world rests on Her and it will become dissolved in Her. She is
therefore, the Highest and Best. O King! Know, verily, that he alone can
cross the delusion (Moha) on whom the Grace of the Devî falls and
otherwise no one can escape from this Anâdi Moha.”

 

Here ends the Tenth Chapter of the Tenth Book on the anecdote of the
King Suratha in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of
18,000 verses by Mahâr<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
