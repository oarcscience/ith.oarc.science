1-3. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Having the Svastyayana ceremony (a
performance of rite to secure welfare or avert calamity) performed by
the Brâhma<u>n</u>as versed in the Vedas, the powerful V<u>r</u>itra
mounted on his

 

<span id="page_488">p. 488</span>

 

chariot and started to kill Indra, the King of the Gods. The Dânavas
that were previously defeated by the Devas now knowing V<u>r</u>itrâsura
to be powerful, came up to him to serve his cause. The messengers of
Indra, when they saw him ready for battle, hurriedly came to Indra and
informed him all about his doings and other matters connected with it.

 

4-7. The messengers said :-- O Lord! Vis'vakarmâ, having been very much
grieved his son being slain, got very angry and by Abhichâra process (an
incantation with a design to injure or magic spells or charms used for a
malevolent purpose) has created a son in order to kill you. That
indomitable V<u>r</u>itrâsura is now your powerful enemy; mounting on
his chariot he is coming here to fight with you, surrounded by other
Asuras. O highly Fortunate One! This enemy of yours is as high as the
mountain Meru; he is now coming hurriedly to you, making a terrible
noise; guard yourself carefully. O King! While Indra was hearing the
messengers, the Devas came there panic-stricken and terrified and said
:--

 

8-16. The Ga<u>n</u>as said :-- O Lord of the Suras! Ominous signs are
being seen in the houses of the Gods; the birds are making sounds, very
inauspicious and foreboding a great calamity. Crows, vultures, herons,
falcons, and other ugly inauspicious birds are crying and making hoarse
sounds on the tops of houses. Other birds are making incessantly harsh
sounds like chichi koochy. The carriers of the several Devas are weeping
and shedding tears always. O highly Fortunate One! On the tops of houses
are heard very loud and very dreadful sounds of the crying
Râk<u>s</u>asîs at dead of night. O Giver of honour! The flags on the
chariots are falling to the ground without any trace of wind. Thus
ominous signs are being visible on earth and in the air. O King of the
Devas! The ugly faced women, wearing black clothes, are roaming from
house to house and always repeating “Leave the house, and go away at
once.” The Deva women while sleeping in their own temples are seeing in
their dreams that terrible Râk<u>s</u>asîs, coming to them are cutting
away their hairs on their heads and are frightening them. O Indra of the
Devas! The inauspicious signs like these and earthquakes and the falling
of the meteors are taking place. The jackals come in the courtyard of
houses at night and yell horrible heartrending sounds. Lizards are
moving always in the rooms and the several limbs of our bodies are
shaking and thus making very inauspicious signs.

 

17\. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing their words, Indra became very
anxious and called Brihaspati, the Deva Guru, and asked him :--

 

<span id="page_489">p. 489</span>

 

18-20. Indra spoke :--  O Brâhma<u>n</u>a! Very inauspicious signs are
being visible; dreadful winds are blowing and stars are falling from the
skies what are all these? O Intelligent One! You are very wise and
versed in the S'astras and the Guru of the Devas; you are omniscient and
know very well how to remedy the evils. Therefore perform the rites by
which enemies can be killed; do such as our miseries be all averted.

 

21-31. Brihaspati said :-- “O Thousand-eyed! What shall I do? You have
committed shortly a heinous crime; you killed that innocent Muni and so
you have earned a very bad Karmic effect. Very violent sins and good
deeds produce their effects very quickly. It is, therefore, highly
incumbent on those that desire for their own welfare, to take up any
work with great discretion. It is never advisible to do any action that
leads to the tormenting of others. Never do they find happiness who give
pains to others. O Indra! You have committed Brahmahattyâ under the
influence of greed and delusion; now suddenly has appeared the fruit of
that act. O King of the Suras! This V<u>r</u>itra Asura is born
invulnerable to all the Devas. That powerful indomitable Asura chief is
now coming, mounted on a chariot, to kill you, surrounded by the other
Dânavas and taking with him the Vis'vakarmâ-made divine arms and weapons
equal to thunderbolt. He is coming like a second Kâla, as it were, to
destroy the whole Universe. There is none in this Triloka, capable kill
him; and his death will not also take place. While Brihaspati was thus
speaking, a great tumultuous uproar rose at once. The Gandharbas,
Kinnaras, Yak<u>s</u>as, Munis and other Immortals began to fly away
from their quarters. Indra seeing the Devas flying away became very
anxious and gave orders at once that all subservient to him must be
ready at once for battle; they must go and call the Vasus, the Rudras,
the twin As'vins, the Âdityas, Pûsâ, Bhaga, Vâyu, Kuvera, Varu<u>n</u>a,
Yama and the other Devas to come there at once. The enemy is well nigh;
so let all the Devas come on their Vimânas quickly there.”

 

32-44. Thus ordering, Indra mounted on the Airâvata elephant and taking
the Sura Guru in front started from his own temple. The other Devas
mounted on their respective carriers and, firmly resolved to fight,
started with all their arms and weapons. On the other hand,
V<u>r</u>itrâsura surrounded by the Demons, came up to the beautiful
mountain, adorned with trees, on the north side of the Mânasarovara
Lake. Indra, too, came there with Brihaspati in front and attended by
all the other Devas to that mountain, north of the Mânasa Lake and began
to fight. A dreadful fight, then, ensued between V<u>r</u>itra and Indra
with clubs, swords, Parighas, Pâs'as, arrows, S'aktis, Parsus and other
weapons. The terrible

fight lasted for full one hundred human years, terrifying to the
self-controlled Ri<u>s</u>is and all the human beings. Varu<u>n</u>a
first turned his back; then Vâyu, then Yama, the Sun and Moon and then
Indra fled from the battle-field. Seeing Indra and the other Devas
flying away, V<u>r</u>itrâsura came to the hermitage and there bowed
down to his father who looked very glad; and he said :-- O Father! I
have carried out your orders; Indra and all the other Devas are defeated
in the battle; as elephants and deer fly away seeing a lion, so the
Devas all fled away to their respective abodes. I have taken the
Airâvata, the best of elephants, away from Indra who fled away on foot.
O Bhagavan! I have brought the elephant here. Kindly accept it. O
Father! It is not advisable to kill a man who is terrified, therefore I
did not kill them. Now kindly order anything else that I may fulfil your
desires. All the Devas fled away from the battle-field, very much tired
and terrified; and what more to say than this that Indra, too, fled,
leaving his elephant on the field.

 

45-54. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Vis'vakarmâ became very glad to hear his
son's words and said :-- “Today I can rightly say that I have got my son
and that my life is successful. O son! To-day you have sanctified me; my
cares and worries are abated; my mind is also calm to see your wonderful
prowess. O Child! Now hear attentively what I say. O highly intelligent
One! Now carefully sit in your steady posture (Sthirâsan) and practise
Tapasyâ. Never trust anybody; Indra is now your enemy, ever ready to
find your faults, and clever in sowing dissensions between you and your
well-wishers. O Son! Tapasyâ is not an ordinary thing; Lak<u>s</u>mî
(prosperity) is obtained thereby; excellent kingdoms, increase of
vigour, and victories in battles are obtained. Therefore worship
Hira<u>n</u>yagarbha and get excellent boons from him; then kill this
vicious Indra, guilty of the sin Brahmahattyâ. Worship the auspicious
Creator calmly and carefully. The four-faced Brahmâ then will be pleased
and grant you your desired boon. First please the Creator of indomitable
prowess, from Whose womb has sprung all this Universe, and get, then,
immortality from Him. Then kill that guilty Indra, my enemy. O Son! My
feeling of enmity due to the killing of my son reigns always in my mind;
I cannot go to sleep peacefully nor do I get peace in any way. The
vicious Indra killed my son; O V<u>r</u>itra! What more shall I say to
you; I am merged in the ocean of sorrows; save me.”

 

55-60. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus hearing his father's words,
V<u>r</u>itrâsura became inflamed with anger and, getting his
permission, set out gladly to practise Tapasyâ. He then went to the
Gandhamâdan mountain and performed his bath in the holy and auspicious
river

Mandâ Kinî, and, preparing a Sthirâsan, took his seat in the Kus'â
grass, to practise the tapasyâ. He left off gradually taking his food,
then subsisted on water only and remained engaged in Yoga; and, seated
in Sthirâsan meditated incessantly on Prajâpati, the Creator of this
Universe. Indra, on the other hand, knowing V<u>r</u>itrâsura engaged in
tapasyâ became very anxious and sent to him Gandharvas, Yak<u>s</u>as,
Pannagas, Kinnaras, Vidyâdharas, Apsarâs and other Deva messengers, all
of unbounded vigour to create obstacles in his austerities. These
Gandharvas and other Deva Yonies, expert in exercising magical spells,
tried many ways and means and various gestures and postures to create
disturbances in his penance; but that great ascetic V<u>r</u>itra, the
son of Vis'vakarmâ did not swerve a bit from his meditative state.

 

Here ends the Third Chapter of the Sixth Book on the defeat of the Deva
army and on V<u>r</u>itra's tapasyâ in the Mahâpurânam S'rî Mad Devî
Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
