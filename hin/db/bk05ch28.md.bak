1-5. Vyâsa said :-- O King! The Devî, hearing thus, laughed and spoke
the following reasonable words, in a voice deep as a rumbling cloud :--
O Dull brained one! Already I told to that messenger before in reply to
you; why then do you boast in vain? If there be any such in the three
worlds who can stand equal to Me in appearance, strength, and
prosperity, I will marry him. Go to S’umbha and Nis’umbha and inform
them that thus I promised before; therefore let any of them conquer Me
in battle and then marry Me according to the prescribed rules. You have
come here to execute the order of S’umbha; so either stand up and fight
or fly to Pâtâla with your King.

 

6-11. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing the Devî’s words, the Dânava was
filled with anger and began to shoot dreadful arrows at once on the
Lion. Ambikâ, then, ready-handed, seeing the multitude of arrows coming
in the sky like serpents, cut them off in a moment to pieces by Her
sharp arrows. The Devî, then, drawing Her bow, shot arrows sharpened on
stone at the great Asura Raktabîja. Then that wicked Demon, thus shot at
by the arrows, fell unconscious on the chariot. When he lay thus
senseless, a great uproar arose amidst his army and the soldiers began
to cry aloud saying, “Alas! We all are killed.” Then S’umbha, the king
of the Asuras, hearing the sound of Boombâ (a danger cry by hands and
mouth) ordered all the Dânavas to be ready for the battle.

 

12\. Then S’umbha said :-- Let all Kâmbojas go to the battle with all
their forces; let other powerful heroes, especially the Kâlakeyâs, too,
who are very strong heroes, go up for the battle. (Note: Kâmboja, name
of a people and their country. They inhabited the Hindoo Koosh mountain
which separates the Giljit valley from Balkh and probably extended up to
little Tibet and Lâdak. The Kâlakeyâs may be the Afridis.)

 

13-33. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus ordered, all the fourfold army of
S’umbha, viz., cavalry, infantry, elephants and chariots went out,
intoxicated for war, to the battle ground where the Devî existed. The
Devî Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ, seeing the Dânava forces coming near, made at once
terrible sounds frequently. The Ambikâ Devî also made the sound with Her
bowstring and blew Her conchshell. Kâlî, then, shouted aloud opening Her
mouth widely. The powerful Lion, the Devî’s Vâhana, hearing the terrible
sounds, roared so loudly that the Dânavas were struck with strange
terror. The powerful Dânavas, then, hearing that sound became

impatient with anger and shot arrows after arrows on the Devî. The
wonderful horrible battle, then, ensued, causing horripilation and the
S’aktis of Brahmâ and the other Devas began to come to Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ
Devî. The Devîs, the wives of the several Devas, then went, to the
battlefield in their respective forms with ornaments and Vâhanas as
generally on such occasions. The S’akti (wife) of Brahmâ named
Brahmâ<u>n</u>i, mounting on the back of Her Swan came there with a
string of beads and Kama<u>nd</u>alu (an wooden waterpot used by
ascetics). The Vai<u>sn</u>avî with Her yellow robes came there mounted
on Garu<u>d</u>a (the sacred bird of Vi<u>sn</u>u, the carrier of Him)
with conch, discus, club, and lotus in Her hands. The Devî S’ankarî, the
wife of S’iva, the Auspicious One, arrived on the back of Her Bull. The
emblem of half-moon was on Her forehead while in Her hands She held
snake, bracelet, and trident (Trisûla) and the sign of fearlessness for
Her devotees. The beautiful wife of Kârtika, Kaumâri Devî, looking like
Kartika, came to fight there mounted on a peacock. The fairfaced
Indrâ<u>n</u>î, decked with ornaments on Her several limbs, came there
to fight, with thunder-bolt in Her hand, mounted on the elephant
Airâvata. The Vârâhî Devî looking like a female boar, came also, seated
on an elevated seat of departed souls (Preta). The Nârasimhî, resembling
Nrisimha (the Man Lion Incarnation) came there. The wife of Yama,
looking fearful like Yama arrived there on the battlefield smiling and
with staff in Her hand and mounted on the back of a buffalo. Thus the
wives of Kuvera, Varu<u>n</u>a, and other Devas came there with proper
forms, Vâhanas, ornaments, accompanied by their forces and all excited.
Seeing them all, the Devî Ambikâ became glad; the Devas, too, became
peaceful and expressed their great joy; the Dânavas were afraid at the
sight of them. S’ankara, auspicious to all the beings, came there to the
battlefield, surrounded by these goddesses and thus said to
Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ :-- Slay quickly all these Asuras, S’umbha, Nis’umbha
and all other Dânavas to serve the cause of the Devas. Let all the
goddesses destroy the Dânava race and thus free the world from dangers;
they may, then, return to their own abodes. Let the Devas get their
shares of sacrifices, let the Brâhma<u>n</u>as perform the sacrificial
acts, and let all the creatures, moving or not moving, be happy. Let all
calamities such as proceed from drought, excessive rain, rats, foreign
invasion, locusts and birds, bats, etc., come to an end. Let the clouds
bestow rains regularly and let the cultivation yield ample harvests.
Note here that rats bring in plague.

 

34-40. Vyâsa said :-- O King! When S’ankara, the Lord of the gods and
Auspicious to all, said thus, a wonderful female ensued out of the body
of Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ, very furious, horrible, with hundreds of jackals
surrounding and yelling; then that S’akti, of dreadful appearance, said

 

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

 

to the five-faced S’iva, smiling :-- O Deva of the Devas! Go quickly to
the lord of the Daityas; do the duty of a messenger for us, O Destroyer
of lust! O S’ankara! Tell that haughty lustful S’umbha and Nis’umbha
leave the Heavens and go to Pâtâla. Let the Devas reign in the Heavens;
Indra go to his own beautiful throne; let all the Devas go to their
appropriate places in Heaven and receive their sacrificial offerings
duly. And if the Demons desire to live, let them go quickly to the city
of Pâtâla where other Dânavas are dwelling. Else, if they like to die,
let them go quickly to the battlefield and let their flesh be eaten up
by Her jackals.

 

41\. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Hearing Her words, S’ûlapâ<u>n</u>i went
quickly to S’umbha, the lord of the Dânavas, seated in the assembly, and
said thus :--

 

42-44. O King! I am Hara, the Destroyer of the Asura Tripurâ; now I have
come to you for your good as a messenger of Ambikâ Devî. Quit the
Heavens and Earth and go quickly to Pâtâla where reside the powerful
Bali and Prahlâda, or if you like to court Death, come to fight; I will
slay you all in a moment. O King! The Great Queen Ambikâ Devî has sent
me with these instructions for your welfare and information.

 

45-63. Vyâsa said :-- O King! Thus conveying the nectarlike, beneficial
words of the Devî to the chief Daityas, S’iva, the Holder of the
trident, returned to his own place. The S’akti that sent S’ambhu as a
messenger to the Dânavas is known in three worlds as S’iva Dûtî. The
Daityas, thus hearing the rigorous words of the Devî, put on their coats
of armour and taking their bows and arrows quickly went out to fight.
They came with great force to the battlefield, stretched their bows to
their ears and shot piercing arrows, sharpened on stone and tipped with
iron, at the Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ Devî. The Kâlikâ Devî, too began to strike
some with the trident, some with S’akti weapon, and some with clubs and
rent them asunder and devoured them all, and began to roam in the field.
Brahmâ<u>n</u>i began to pour water from Her Kamandalu on the powerful
Dânavas in the battlefield and thus destroyed them. Mahes’varî, mounting
on Her Bull gave violent blows by Her trident and thus lay them dead on
the ground. Vai<u>sn</u>avî, with the blow of Her club, took away the
lives of many Daityas and striking them with Her Discus out off the
heads of several others. Indrânî hurled Her thunderbolt on the chief
Dânavas, already struck by the feet of the elephant and lay them dead on
the field. Nârasimhî tore the strongest Dânavas with the sharp nails
and, devouring them, walked to and fro and made dreadful sounds. S’iva
Dûtî began to laugh hoarsely and laid the Dânavas flat on the field,
when they were at once devoured by Kâlikâ and Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ. Kaumâri,
seated on a peacock, by drawing the bowstring to

Her ears hurled arrows sharpened on stone on the enemies and killed them
to serve the cause of the gods. Vâru<u>n</u>i tied down the Dânavas by
Her Pâsa weapons in a face to face fighting; thus they lay down
senseless on the ground. O King! Thus the Mâtrikâs, the goddesses,
crushed the forces. Then the other powerful soldiers fled away
terrified. The “Boombâ” danger cry rose then loudly; on the other hand,
the Devas began to shower flowers on the Devîs. Hearing the distressful
agonies of the Asuras and the shouts of victory of the Devas, Raktabîja,
the chief of the Dânavas became very angry. Seeing specially the Dânavas
flying away and the Devas shouting, that powerful Demon came hurriedly
to the battlefield with anger. Then with eyes reddened with anger, and
with various weapons came before the Devî, Raktabîja mounting on a
chariot, and making sounds unusual with his bowstring.

 

Here ends the Twenty-eighth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the description
of the fighting of the goddesses in S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam the Mahâ
Purâ<u>n</u>am, of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
