<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

 

1-2. Vyâsa said :-- Hearing these vicious words, Jânakî became very much
confounded with fear and began to tremble; somehow collecting herself
she began to say :-- “O descendant of the family of Pulastya! Why are
you, prompted by lust, uttering these sinful words? I am born of the
family of Janaka; therefore I cannot act wantonly according to my own
inclination.

 

3\. O ten faced one! Better you go to Lankâ quickly; else Râmchandra
will take away your life; you will no doubt incur death for my sake.”

 

4-5. Thus saying, Sîtâ Devî went towards the Sacred fire called
Gârhapatya, placed in the house, with words “go away” “go away” in her
mouth. He, whose wickedness has caused all the Lokas cry out “save”
“save”, the same Râva<u>n</u>a, of perverted intellect, then assumed his
real form, went towards the hut and caught hold of Sîtâ Devî who was
crying, bewildered with fear.

 

6\. Sîtâ cried “Râma” “Râma” “Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a”, and the sinful
Râva<u>n</u>a caught hold of her and quickly mounting her on the
chariot, fast got away.

 

7-9. On the way Jatâyu, the son of Aru<u>n</u>a, met Râva<u>n</u>a; and
a terrible fight then ensued between the two, when the evil minded
Râva<u>n</u>a, the king of the Demons, killed Jatâyu. Râva<u>n</u>a
carried Sîtâ to Lankâ. Then Sîtâ cried like a forlorn deer and
Râva<u>n</u>a kept her in the As’oka forest (Jaffna),

surrounded and guarded by the Râk<u>s</u>asis. The king of Lankâ tempted
Sîtâ with comforting words, and the kingdoms, etc., but she never
swerved from her own pure and stainless chastity.

10-12. On the other side, Râmachandra after killing the deer and taking
it was coming back calmly, when he saw Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a going to
him and said “O Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a! What a great blunder you have
committed! Hearing the voice of that villain conjurer, how is it that
you have left my dear Sîtâ alone and come here!” Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a
said :-- “O Lord! Being pierced sharply by Sîtâ Devî’s words (coming
like sharpened arrows) and being driven away by her, under the guidance
of the Inevitable Destiny as it were, I have come here; there is no
doubt in this.”

 

13\. They, then, both hurriedly went to their hut, made of leaves; and
there not finding Sîtâ, they were very much afflicted with sorrows and
went in quest of Jânakî.

 

14\. Râma and Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a in their search for Sîtâ, came at
last to the spot where Jatâyu, the king of birds, was lying on the
surface of the earth, with his life ultimately on the point of parting
away from his body.

 

15-16. Jatâyu said :-- Râva<u>n</u>a, the king of Lankâ, carried away
today stealthily Sîtâ Devî; I resisted that villain who then fought with
me on that account and threw me down on this spot by weapons. Thus
saying, the king of birds died; whereupon Râmchandra performed the
burning of his dead body as well his funeral ceremonies. Then both of
them went out of that place.

 

17\. Then the Lord Râmachandra killed Kabandha and freed him from his
curse; and, through his advice, he made friendship with Sugrîva, the
king of the monkeys, and was thus bound under a tie.

 

18\. Next Râma killed the hero Balî as a duty and gave the excellent
kingdom of Ki<u>s</u>kindhyâ to his new friend Sugrîva according to his
promise.

 

19\. Then, he began to ceaselessly think of the stealing away of Sîtâ by
Râva<u>n</u>a and passed away the four months of the rainy season there
with his brother Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a.

 

20\. Râma, being very much shaken on account of the bereavement of Sîtâ,
began to address Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a thus :-- “O Saumitre! The
desires of the daughter of the king of Kekaya are now fulfilled.

 

21\. Jânakî will no more be obtained; without Jânakî I will not go back
to Ayodhyâ; without Jânakî I won’t be able to live any longer.

 

22\. Kingdom lost, dwelling in forests happened, father left his body,
at last the dear wife is lost; the cruel hands of Destiny are tormenting
me now thus; what more it will inflict, how can I say now?

 

23\. O Brother Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a! What is to happen is very hard to
be known beforehand by men; I cannot say, what is written on my fate
after this, painful or otherwise.

 

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

 

24\. See! Both of us, the descendants of Manu, though born in a royal
family, are exiled in forests due to our past deeds.

 

25\. O Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a! It is by Fate, too, that you, abandoning
the pleasures of the royal surroundings, have come out with me; and you,
too, are now suffering heaps of dire troubles with me.

 

26\. No one in our family suffered so much as we are suffering; why we
talk of our family! No human being was ever born or will ever take his
birth that suffered or will suffer like me so many troubles, will be
like me incapacitated and a penniless pauper.

 

27\. O Saumitre! I am drowned in the ocean of pains and troubles; What
am I to do now? I have no means to cross this ocean; I am quite
helpless, no doubt.

 

28\. No money, nor armies, O hero! you are my one and only one
companion; O brother! On whom shall I be angry when I am suffering on
account of my own deeds?

 

29\. Alas! The kingdom that could have been compared in prosperity to
the Indra Sabha, was almost obtained by me when, in an instant, I lost
it and am now in exile in forest. Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>! Who can
ascertain what is in the womb of Destiny?

 

30\. Oh! That soft bodied Sîtâ, with her child like nature came out with
us in this forest; but the inexorable Fate has now drowned her, that
perfectly beautiful woman, into an ocean of sorrows, difficult to be
crossed?

 

31\. That fair daughter of Janaka is extremely devoted to me; she is
pure and holy. How will she be able to suffer troubles in the house of
the king of Lankâ!

 

32\. O Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a! Sîtâ Devî will never come under the
control of Râva<u>n</u>a; how can that excellent chaste woman act like
an ordinary public woman?

 

33\. O Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a! Rest assured that in case Râva<u>n</u>a
exercises, out of his lordly position, any violence on Sîtâ, she will
rather put an end to her life than come under his control.

 

34\. O Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a! And when Jânakî sacrifices her life, I
will assuredly do the same; for, of what use, then is this body to me
when that fair Sîtâ has gone away with her life?”

 

35\. While the lotus eyed Râmchandra was thus weeping and expressing his
regrets and sorrows, the religious Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a consoled him
with the following sweet, truthful, words :--

 

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

 

36\. “O Hero of the heroes! Kindly cast aside this weakness and have
patience; I will soon kill that villain demon Râva<u>n</u>a and get you
back your Sîtâ Devî.

 

37\. The wise steady persons remain on account of their fortitude,
unshaken in their hearts whether in joy or in sorrow; whereas men, of
little intellect, indulge in sorrows when they are happy.

 

38\. Coming in union and going out in disunion, both are under the hands
of Destiny; What, then, there is the need for expressing sorrows for
this body, which is not soul.

 

39\. As we have been banished from our kingdom into this forest, as
there has happened this bereavement of Sîtâ, so, in proper time, we will
again get back Sîtâ Devî.

 

40\. O Darling of Jânakî! There must come a time when sorrows will be
converted into happiness and vice versa; there will be nothing
otherwise. So avoid this sorrow now and have firmness.

 

41\. There are multitudes of monkeys, who are our helping hands; they
will go to all the four quarters and bring back to us the news of the
daughter of Janaka; there is no doubt in this.

 

42\. O Lord! Knowing the way to Lankâ, we will go there and kill by our
prowess the villainous Râva<u>n</u>a and bring back Sîtâ Devî.

 

43\. Or we will call Bharata with Satrugh<u>n</u>a and with all the
armies we all united will kill our enemy; why, then, are you thus
expressing sorrows in vain.

 

44\. O Lord! our ancestor Raghu, the hero of heroes, the monarch; won
his victories over the ten quarters; and you belong to that family and
are now plunged in grief!

 

45\. Alone, I can defeat all the Devas and the Demons; and if I get
help, is there any doubt, then, in my killing, that Râva<u>n</u>a, the
disgrace of the family of Râk<u>s</u>asas.

 

46\. O Powerful One! We may call to, our aid the king of Janaka and root
out that wicked source of enemy to the Devas.

 

47-48. O Descendant of Raghu! Like the rim of a wheel, happiness and
pain come alternately; it is not that happiness, or pain comes and
remains for ever. He whose mind is very much overwhelmed. with pain or
happiness, is the man who is always plunged in an ocean of misery; and
he can never expect to become happy.

 

49\. See! In days of yore, Indra once got addicted into vicious habits.
The Devas united put in place of Indra, the king Nahu<u>s</u>a.

 

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

 

50\. Then Indra, terrified, relinquished his post and passed very many
years into an unknown and unnoticed state within the lotus.

 

51\. Again, when time changed, he got his own post back; and the king
Nahu<u>s</u>a fell down on this earth and became transformed into a boa
constrictor (a big serpent), through the curse of a Ri<u>s</u>i.

 

52\. The king Nahu<u>s</u>a wanted the wife of Indra and insulted a
Brâhmi<u>n</u>; therefore, he was, under the curse of Mahar<u>s</u>i
Agasti, transformed into a snake on the earth.

 

53\. Therefore, O Râghava! One ought not to plunge in grief, when a
danger comes; rather one should be quite energetic in times of danger
and remain firm; thus, the sages do.

 

54\. O Lord of the world! You are high minded, omniscient and
omnipotent; why are you now overwhelmed with grief, like an ordinary
mortal.”

 

55\. Vyâsa said :-- Oh king! Thus consoled by Lak<u>s</u>ma<u>n</u>a,
Râma discarded all his heavy sorrows and began to remain with his heart
firm and at rest.

 

Thus ends the 29th chapter on the stealing of Sîtâ and the sorrows of
Râma in the 3rd Skandha of S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
