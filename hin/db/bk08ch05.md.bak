1-31. S'rî Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Child Nârada! Now hear in detail
about the divisions of the earth into the Dvîpas and the Var<u>s</u>as
as marked out by the Devas. In brief, I describe about them; no one can
speak about this in details. First, the Jambu Dvîpa is one lâkh Yoyanas
in its dimensions. This Jambu Dvîpa is round like a lotus. There are
nine Var<u>s</u>as in it and excepting the Bhadrâs'va and Ketumâla, each
is nine thousand Yoyanas in its dimensions (i.e., in its diameter or
circumference?) and there are eight very lofty mountains, in those
Var<u>s</u>as, forming their boundaries. Of the Var<u>s</u>as, the two
Var<u>s</u>as that are situated in the North and South, are of the size
of a bow (segmental); and the four others are elongated in their size.
The centre of all these Var<u>s</u>as is named Îlâvrita Var<u>s</u>a and
its size is rectangular. In the centre of this Îlâvar<u>s</u>a is
situated the golden Sumeru Mountain, the King of all the mountains, one
lakh Yoyanas high. It forms the pericarp of the lotus earth. The top of
this mountain is thirty Yoyanas wide. O Child! The sixteen thousand
Yoyanas of this mountain is under the ground and the eighty four Yoyanas
are visible outside. In the north of this Îlâvar<u>s</u>a are the three
mountains the Nîlagiri, the S'vetagiri and the S'ringavau, forming the
boundaries respectively of the three Var<u>s</u>as named Ramyaka,
Hira<u>n</u>maya and Kuru respectively. These run along from the east
and gradually extend at their base and towards the salt ocean (Lavana
Samudra).

These three mountains, that form the boundaries, are each two thousand
Yoyanas wide. The length of each from the east towards north is less by
one-tenth (1/10) of the above dimensions. Many rivers take their source
and flow from them. On the south of Îlâvar<u>s</u>a three beautiful
mountain ranges, named Ni<u>s</u>adha, Hemakûta, and Himâlayâs, are
situated, extending from the east. They are each one Ayuta Yoyanas high.
These three mountains form the boundaries again of Kimpuru<u>s</u>a and
Bhârata Var<u>s</u>a.

 

To the west of Îlâvrita is situated the mountain called Mâlyavân and to
the east are situated the mountains Gandhamâdan, Nîla, and
Ni<u>s</u>adha, the centres of the highest sublime grandeur and beauty.
The length and breadth of these the boundary (limiting) mountains are
each two thousand Yoyanas. Then the mountains Mandara, Supârs'vak, and
Kumuda and others are situated in the Ketumâla and Bhadrâs'va
Var<u>s</u>as; but these all are reckoned as the Pâda Parvatas
(mountains at the foot) of the Sumeru mountain. The height and breadth
of each of these is one Ayuta Yoyanas. These form the pillars, as it
were, of Meru on the four sides. On these mountains, the mangoe, the
jack, plantain, and the fig trees and various others are situated, four
hundred (400) Yoyanas wide and eleven hundred (1,100) Yoyanas high; they
seem to extend to the Heavens and form, as it were, the flagstaffs on
the top. The roots, bases of these trees as well as their branches are
wonderfully equally thick and extend to enormous distances. On those
mountain tops are situated again, the four very capacious lakes. Of
these, one lake is all milk; the other lake is all honey; the third lake
is all sugarcane juice and the fourth lake is all sweet water. There
are, then, again the four very lovely gardens named Nandana,
Chaitrarath, Vaibhrâjaka, and Sarvatobhadra, very lovely, enchanting and
pleasing to the delicate female sex and where the Devas enjoy the wealth
and prosperity and their other Yogic powers. Here the Devas live always
with numerous hordes of women and have their free amorous, dealings with
them, to their heart's contents and they hear the sweet songs sung by
the Gandharbas and Kinnaras, the Upa Devatâs about their own glorious
deeds. On the top of the Mandara mountain, there are the Heavenly mangoe
trees eleven hundred Yoyanas high; the sweet delicious nectarlike mangoe
fruits, very soft and each of the size as the summit of a mountain, fall
to the ground; and out of their juices of a colour of the rising sun, a
great river named Aru<u>n</u>odâ takes her origin. Here the Devas always
worship the great Devî Bhagavatî named Aru<u>n</u>â, the Destructrix of
all sins, the Grantrix of all desires, and the Bestower of all
fearlessness with various offerings and with the lovely water of this
Aru<u>n</u>odâ river, with great devotion. O Child! In ancient days, the
King of the Daityas worshipped always this Mahâ

Mâyâ Aru<u>n</u>â Devî (and obtained immense wealth and prosperity). He
who worships Her becomes cured of all diseases, gets his health and
other happiness by Her grace. Therefore She is named Âdyâ, Mâyâ, Atulâ,
Anantâ, Pu<u>st</u>î, Îs'varamâlinî, the Destroyer of the wicked and the
Giver of lustre and beauty and thus remembered on this capacious earth.
The river Jâmbûnada has come out, as a result of Her worship, containing
divine gold.

 

Here ends the Fifth Chapter of the Eighth Book on the description of the
receptacle of beings and on the mountains and on the origin of rivers in
the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S'rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam, of 18,000 verses, by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
