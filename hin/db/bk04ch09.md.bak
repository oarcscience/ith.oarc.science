1\. Vyâsa said :-- After performing duly his religious rites there, the
son of Hiranya Kas'ipu saw before him an unbrageous peepul tree.

 

2-3. There he saw along with the feathers of vultures, the terrible,
sharpened under a stone, various glittering arrows, arrayed in due
order; and he was surprised to think who could have kept such arrows,
well guarded in this very holy hermitage of the Ri<u>s</u>is.

 

4-5. While Prahlâda was thus meditating in his mind, he saw before him,
wearing the skin of a black antelope, the two sons of Dharma, the two
Munis Nara Nârâya<u>n</u>a, loaded on their heads with high clots of
hairs. Before them were placed the two white bows named S'ârngam and
Âjagavam, (Pinâka) the bows of Vi<u>sn</u>u and S'iva respectively,
bearing their qualified marks, as well as their two inexhaustible big
quivers.

 

6-10. The Lord of the Daityas, then, saw those two blessed ones, the two
Ri<u>s</u>is Nara Nârâya<u>n</u>a, the two sons of Dharma, deeply
absorbed in meditation. Seeing this, he became very much enraged, his
eyes became red, and he began to address them thus :-- O two Ascetics!
Has vain arrogance possessed your mind to destroy religion? It is never
seen nor even heard, that the practice of severe asceticism and the
holding of the bows and arrows, were carried into effect simultaneously
by one man in any of the Four Ages. These two are contradictory things.
That may be worthy in the Kali Yuga? This asceticism is fit for the
Brâhma<u>n</u>as; why, then are the bows and arrows held by you? There
is an irreconcilable difference between the holding of clotted hairs on
the head and the holding in the hand of the bows and arrows. Therefore,
do you practise religious rites, with feelings befitting your divine
positions!

 

11\. Vyâsa said :-- O Descendant of Bharata! On hearing thus the
Prahlâda's words, the Nara Ri<u>s</u>i said :-- O Lord of the Daityas!
What matters it to you? Why do you, for nothing, trouble yourself with
our tapasyâ.

 

12\. An able man can accomplish any thing. It is widely known in the
three worlds, that we are able to accomplish these two things
contemporaneously. O thou of weak understanding!

 

13\. In the battle field as well as in asceticism, we can shew our
prowess. What have you got to do with us in these matters? The road
before you is unobstructed, you can go wherever you like; why do you
brag of your own merits?

 

14\. You are very dull and stupid; what can you understand of a
Brâhma<u>n</u>ic glory that is very rare and attained with great
difficulty? Those that want happiness need not meddle with the
Brâhma<u>n</u>as.

15-16. Prahlâda said :-- Blunt headed and vain braggarts are you! When I
am present in this Tîrtha, I who am the upholder of Dharma, I won\`t
allow you to practise any irreligious things here! O Ascetics! Better
show me your skill in fight to-day.

 

17-18. Vyâsa said :-- O king! The Ri<u>s</u>i Nara on hearing his words
replied :-- Give us battle if you are so desirous. O wretched amongst
the Asuras! In to-day's battle, I will knock your head down, and then
you shall never in future desire to fight with any body.

 

19-20. Vyâsa said :-- On hearing these words, the chief of the Daityas
was very much angry and promised to conquer these two self controlled
Ri<u>s</u>i ascetics, Nara Nârâya<u>n</u>a by any means whatsoever.

 

21-22. Vyâsa said :-- Thus saying, the Daitya took up his bow and
quickly stretched it with arrow and the bow string made a terrible
noise. Then Nara, too, too up with anger his bows and began to shoot
arrows at Prahlâda lots of sharpened arrows and weapons.

 

23\. The lord of the Daityas quickly selected the arrows, glittering
like gold, and with them tore asunder the arrows thrown by Nara. Nara,
seeing his arrows, cut asunder, became infuriated with anger and began
to hurl as quickly lots of other arrows.

 

24\. Prahlâda then cut asunder with arrows, of quick velocity, the
Nara's weapons and struck violently on the breast of Nara. Nara, too,
with anger pierced the arms of Prahlâda with five quick arrows.

 

25\. Indra and the other Devas came on their respective aeroplanes to
see their fight and began to give cheers sometimes to Nara and sometime
to Prahlâda from above the skies.

 

26\. The Lord of the Daityas taking up his bow, began out of furious
anger to hurl various weapons on Nara as incessantly as clouds give rain
over the mountain peaks. The Nara Muni now became very much exhausted
and weary, being struck with Prahlâda's arrows.

 

27\. Nârâya<u>n</u>a then seeing Nara exhausted, became very much amazed
and bolding his unequalled S'ârnga bow, began to quit arrows, shining
with with golden lustre.

 

28\. O Lord of the earth! Then Narâya<u>n</u>a and Prahlâda both were
desirous to win the victory, and a terrible fight ensued. The Devas
gladly poured forth flowers on their heads from the skies.

 

29\. The king of the Daityas got very much enraged and began to hurl
arrows with tremendous quickness. Nârâya<u>n</u>a, the son of Dharma,
immediately cut asunder those weapons with his very sharp arrow.

 

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

 

30-32. Nârâya<u>n</u>a too, threw arrows sharpened under stones with
high velocity and very much troubled the lord of the Daityas, who now
became very much restless.

 

33-34. The sky was covered over with arrows and arrows from both the
parties and the day looked like the night. Then the Devas and the
Daityas were very much astonished and told each other, “We never saw
before a terrible fight like this.”

 

35\. Then the Devar<u>s</u>is, Gandarbhas, Yak<u>s</u>as, Kinnaras,
Pannagas, Vidyâdharas and Châra<u>n</u>as were all very much confounded.

 

36-37. The two Ri<u>s</u>is Nârada and Parvata came also to witness
their fight; the Devar<u>s</u>i Nârada told the Parvata Ri<u>s</u>i he
never saw before such a dreadful fight. There were awful battles with
Târakâsura and Vritrâsûra and also the battle between Hari and
Madhukai<u>t</u>ava; but they were all inferior and cannot stand in
comparison.

 

38\. It seemed that Prahlâda was very powerful; otherwise how could an
equal fight last so long a time with such an accomplished person,
perfect with all the supernatural powers and of such heroic deeds as
Nârâya<u>n</u>a.

 

39-42. Vyâsa said :-- O king! Day and night the Daityas and the ascetic
Nârâya<u>n</u>a went on fighting terribly with each other. Then
Nârâya<u>n</u>a cut off, with the arrow, the bow of Prahlâda; Prahlâda
soon took another bow; the expert handed Nârâya<u>n</u>a quickly broke
into two that bow. Thus though Prahlâda's arrows were repeatedly cut
asunder still he began to take up fresh bows and Nârâya<u>n</u>a began
to cut them repeatedly.

 

43-44. Thus, then, when all the bows of Prahlâda were destroyed, the
Daitya Râjâ took up Parigha (iron club), became enraged and threw it on
Nârâyana's arm. The powerful Bhagavân Nârâyana, seeing the dreadful iron
club, cut it asunder with nine arrows and pierced Prahlâda with ten
arrows.

 

45-47. Then Prahlâda, enraged, threw the iron gadâ on Nârâya<u>n</u>a's
thighs. The exceedingly powerful Dharma's son was not at all agitated
and stood firm like a rock and taking up arrows quickly cut asunder the
iron gadâ of the Daitya. Then the visitors were much startled.

 

48-49. Then Prahlâda, intent on killing his enemy, became very much
angry and threw the S’akti darts, spears and missiles instantly on
Nârâya<u>n</u>a's thighs with great velocity. Nârâya<u>n</u>a with one
arrow cut that easily into seven parts and with seven arrows pierced
Prâhladâ.

 

50\. Thus for one thousand Deva years the terrible fight lasted between
Prahlâda and Nârâya<u>n</u>a in that hermitage; and the whole universe
was struck with surprise.

 

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

 

51-52. Then Gadâdhara with yellow robes and four hands quickly came
there and called Prahlâda. The son of Hira<u>n</u>ya Kas'ipoo, Prahlâda,
seeing the Lord of Lak<u>s</u>mi, four armed, Nârâya<u>n</u>a with lotus
and disc in His hands come there, bowed low, and, with folded hands,
began to speak to him with great devotion.

 

53-54. O Deva of the Devas! You are the Lord of the universe and devoted
to your devotees. O Mâdhava! I have fought for full one hundred Deva
years; still I have not not been able to defeat these ascetics. I do not
know why. I am surprised at it.

 

55-56. Vi<u>sn</u>u said :-- O Forgiving One! These two Ri<u>s</u>is
Nara Nârâya<u>n</u>a are, the perfect ascetics, self controlled and born
of my Amsas. Therefore you have not been able to defeat them. What
wonder is there! O king! Better go now to your Pâtâla and keep your
steadfast devotion on me. O Intelligent one! Do not quarrel any more
with these two ascetics.

 

57\. Vyâsa said :-- O king! The Daitya king Prahlâda then advised by
Vi<u>sn</u>u went out of that place with his Asura followers; and the
two Nara Nârâya<u>n</u>as began again to practise their Tapasyâs.

 

Here ends the Ninth Chapter of the Fourth Book of S’rî Mad Devî
Bhagâvatam, the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am; of 18,000 verses, on the fight
between the Ri<u>s</u>is and Prahlâda by Mahar<u>s</u>î Veda Vyâsa.
