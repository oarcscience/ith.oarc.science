### <span id="page_731">p. 731</span>

1-2. The Himâlayâs said :-- "O Devî! Describe the places on this earth
that are prominent, sacred, and worth visiting and which Thou likest
best. O Mother! Also sanctify us by describing the vows and utsabs that
are pleasing to Thee, and by performing which, men become blessed and
get themselves satisfied.

3-10. The Devî spoke :-- "O Himavan! All the places that are on this
earth are all Mine and all should be visited. And every moment is fit
for taking vows and utsabs. For I am of the nature pervading every
moment; so whatever actions are performed at any moment are all equal to
taking My vows and utsabs. O King of Mountains! Still I am now telling
something out of My affection to My Bhakta<u>s</u>. Hear. There is a
great place of pilgrimage named Kolhâpura in the southern country. Here
the Devî Lak<u>s</u>mi always dwells. The second place is Mâtripura in
the Sahyâdrî mountain; here the Devî Re<u>n</u>ukâ dwells. The third
place is Tulajâpur; next is the place Saptas'ringa, the great places of

place named Vedâra<u>n</u>ya where the Sundarî Devî is residing; then

the place of S'rimatî Tripurâ Bhariavî, the excellent of all the places
in this earth, where the Devî Mahâ Mâyâ always dwells. There is no other
place better than this on the earth. Here the Devî becomes every month
in Her course of menstruation and where the virtuous men are seen. Here
all the Devas remain in the form of mountains and where on the mountains
the excellent Devas inhabit. The sages say: That all the places there
are of the nature of the Devî; there is no better place than this
Kâmâkhyâ Yonima<u>nd</u>ala. Pu<u>s</u>kara, the sacred place, is the
seat of Gâyatrî; the place of Cha<u>nd</u>ikâ in Amares'a: and the
excellent place of Pu<u>s</u>karek<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>î in Frabhâsa. The
place of Linga-dhâri<u>n</u>î Devî in Naimi<u>s</u>âra<u>ny</u>a, and
the place of Purubutâ in Pu<u>s</u>karâk<u>s</u>a; Rati dwells in

31-34. The places mentioned above are all dearest to the Devî. First the
merits of these places are to be heard; next the Devî is to be

<span id="page_733">p. 733</span>

worshipped by the rites and ceremonies according to these rules. Or, O
Mountain! All the holy places of pilgrimages exist in Kâs'î. The Devî
always dwells there. Persons, devoted to the Devî, see these places and
if they make Japam and meditate on the lotus-feet of the Devî, they will
certainly be freed from the bonds of Samsâra; there is no doubt in this.
If anybody, getting up in the morning, recite the names of these places,
all his sins would instantly be burnt away.

35-40. And if one reads, in the time of S'râddha, before the
Brahmi<u>n</u>s, these holy names of the Devî, his Pitris will be
purified of their sins in the Mahâkâs'a by the Mahâ Prâ<u>n</u>a and
will get their highest goal. O One of good vows! I will now describe to
you the vows that are to be carefully observed by men and women; hear.
Ananta Tritîyâkhya Vrata (vow), Rasakalyânî Vrata, and Ârdrânandakara
Vrata, these three Vratas are to be observed in the Tritîyâ (third)
tithi. The next come the Friday vow, the Kri<u>sn</u>a Chaturdas'i vows,
the Tuesday vow, and the evening twilight vow. In this twilight vow,
Mahâ Deva placed the Devî in the evening on an Âsana; and He, along with
the other Devas, began to dance before Her. Fasting is enjoined in this
vow; and then in the evening one must worship the Devî, the Giver of all
auspicious things. Especially in every fortnight, if the Devî be
worshipped, She gets extremely pleased.

41\. O Best of Mountains! The Monday vow is very agreeable to Me; the
worship of the Devî should be done and then in the night one must take
one's food.

42-43. The two nine nights vow called Navarâtra are to be observed, one
in the autumn and the other in the spring season. These are very dear to
Me. He is certainly My devotee and very dear who for My satisfaction
performs these and the other Nitya Naimittik vows, free from any pride
and jealousy. He certainly gets the Sâjujya Mukti with Me.

44-46. O Nagarâja! The Holy (Dol) festival in the month of Chait on tha
third day of the white fortnight is very pleasing to Me and should be
observed by all. My devotees perform the S'ayanotsava in the
Paur<u>n</u>âmâsî in the month of Âsâ<u>d</u>ha; the
Jâgara<u>n</u>otsava in the Paur<u>n</u>amâsî in the month of Kârtik,
the Ratha Jâtrâ in the 3rd of the white fortnight in Âsâ<u>d</u>ha; the
Damanotsava in Chaitra. And my dear festivals in the month of S'râvana
and various other festivals.

<span id="page_734">p. 734</span>

47-49. In all these festivals one should feast well with gladness all My
devotees, and the Kumâris (virgins), well clothed and dressed, and the
boys, thinking them all to be of My very nature. No miserliness is to be
entertained and I should be worshipped with flowers, etc. He is blessed
and attains his goal and is dear to Me who carefully and devotedly
observes every year all these festivals. O Nagendra! Thus I have
described to you in brief all the vows that are pleasing to Me. These
instructions are not to be given who is not a disciple nor to one who is
not My devotee.

Here ends the Thirty-eighth Chapter of the Seventh Book on the vows and
the sacred places of the Devî in the Mahâ Purâ<u>n</u>am S'rî Mad Devî
Bhâgavatam, of 18,000 verses, by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
