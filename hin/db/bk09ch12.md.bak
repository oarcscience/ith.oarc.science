1-15. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! Now about the meditation
(Dhyân) of the Devî Gangâ as per Kâ<u>n</u>va S'âkhâ, which destroys all
the sins, O Gange! Of white colour like white lotuses! Thou destroyest
all the sins of men. Thou hast appeared from the body of S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a. Thou art powerful like Him. Thou art very chaste and
pure. Thou hast worn the raiment, uninflammable and decorated all over
with ornaments made of jewels. Thou art more brilliant than one hundred
autumnal Moons. Thou art also well pleased with a smile on Thy lips. And
Thou art always of steady youthful beauty (that never wanes). Thou art
dear to Nârâya<u>n</u>a, calm and of peaceful temper, and proud of being
His with His fortune. Thou bearest the braid of hair, decked with
garlands of Mâlatî flowers; Thy cheeks are anointed with sandal dots,
with Sindûra bindu (dots of red powder, vermilion) and well adorned with
various artistic lines made of musk. Thy garment and Thy beautiful lips
are more red than the ripe Bimba fruit (the red fruit of a
cucurbitaceous plant); Thy teeth vie as it were, with the rows of
pearls. How lovely are Thy eyes! How delightsome is Thy side-long
glance! How close are Thy breasts like Bel fruits! Thy loins are thicker
and more solid then the plantain trees. How do Thy feet look beautiful,
defying the beauty of the Sthalapadma (ground Lotus)!

 

How do the red sandals look lovely with Kunkuma and alaktak (red
powder)! What a red tinge Thy feet have shewn with the honey of

Pârijâta flower that is seen on the head of Indra. The Devas, the
Siddhas, the Munis, offer always Arghyas (offerings of rice with Durba
grass) at Thy feet; the ascetics bow down at Thy feet, and it seems as
though so many lines of bees are on Thy lotus feet. O Mother! Thy lotus
feet give liberation to those that want Mukti and enjoyment to those
that want Bhukti (enjoyments). O Mother! Thou art the boon; Thou art the
chief excellent; Thou grantest boons and Thou showest Thy favour to Thy
devotees; Thou bestowest the Vi<u>sn</u>upadam (the place of
Vi<u>sn</u>u); but Thou hast come from the feet of Vi<u>sn</u>u. Thus
meditating on the Devî Gangâ flowing by three routes (in Heaven, earth
and infernal regions), the bestower of good things one should offer to
the Devî sixteen things :-- Âsana, Pâdya, Arghya, water for bathing,
ointment (anûlepana), Dhûpa (scents), Dîpa (lights), Naivedya (offerings
of food), betel, cool water, clothings, ornaments garlands,
sandal-paste, Âchamanîya (water for sipping), and beautiful beddings and
worship Her with these. Then, with folded hands, one should perform
stotra to Her and bow down to Her with devotion. Thus the worshipper
gets the fruits of A'svamedha sacrifice.

 

16\. Nârada said :-- O Lord of the Devas! At present I am desirous to
hear the sin-destroying and virtue-bestowing stotra (hymn) of Gangâ
Devî, the Purifier of all those that are fallen from virtue, originated
from the feet of Vi<u>sn</u>u, the Lord of world and the husband of
Lak<u>s</u>mî. Kindly narrate all these in detail.

 

17-41. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! Now I am narrating the stotra
of Gangâ Devî, that destroys all sins and bestows all religious merit.
Hear. I bow down to the Ganges who appeared from the body of S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a, enchanted by the music of S'iva, and, who was bathed with
the perspiration (water coming out of the body) of S’rî Râdhâ. I bow
down to Gangâ Devî who first appeared in the circular dance (Râsa
Mâ<u>nd</u>alam) in the region of Goloka and who always remains with
S'ankara. My obeisance to the Devî Gangâ who remains in the auspicious
grand utsab of Râdhâ (Râsa Mâ<u>nd</u>alam), crowded with Gopas and
Gopîs, in the Full Moon night of the month of Kârtik. She is one koti
yojanas wide and one lakh times one koti yojanas long in the region of
Goloka. My Obeisance to Her! In Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha, Gangâ is sixty lakh
yojanas in width and four times that in length. My Obeisance to Her! In
Brahmâ-loka, Gangâ is thirty lakh yojanas wide and five times as long. I
bow down to Her. In S'iva-loka, She is thirty lakh yojanas wide and four
times that in length. I bow down to Her. In Dhruva-loka, She is one lakh
yojanas wide and seven times as long. I bow down to Her. In Chandra-

loka She is one lakh yojanas wide and five times as long. My obeisance
to S’rî Gangâ Devî. I bow down to the Ganges who is sixty thousand
yojanas wide in the Sûrya loka and ten times that in length. I bow down
to Gangâ in Tapo-loka who is one lakh yojanas wide and five times that
in length. My obeisance to Gangâ Devî in Janar-loka, who is one thousand
yojanas wide and ten times that as long. I bow down to Gangâ in
Mahar-loka who is ten lakh yojanas wide and five times that in length.
My obeisance to Gangâ Devî in Kailâs'a who is one thousand yojanas wide
and one hundred times as long. I bow down to Gangâ Devî who is known as
Mandâkinî in Indra-loka, and who is one hundred yojanas wide and ten
times than that in length. My obeisance to Gangâ Devî, known as
Bhogavati in Pâtâla who is ten yojanas wide and five times as long. I
bow down to Gangâ Devî, known as Alakanandâ in this earth, who is two
miles wide, in some places more wide and in some places less wide. I bow
down to Gangâ Devî who was of the colour of milk in Satya yuga, of the
colour of Moon in Tretâ Yuga, of the colour of white sandal-paste in
Dvâpara yuga. I bow down to S’rî Gangâ Devî who is as water in Kali yuga
in this earth and as milk in Kali yuga in Heaven. O Child! By the touch
of one molecule of the water of the Ganges, all the horrible sins
incurred in ten million births, the murder of a Brâhmi<u>n</u> and so
forth, are burnt to ashes. Thus I have described in twenty-one verses
the great stotra (human) of the sin-destroying and the virtue-increasing
merits of Gangâ. He reaps the fruit of the A'svamedha sacrifice (Horse
sacrifice), who daily sings this praise of Gangâ after worshipping Her
with devotion. There is no doubt in this. The persons that are without
any sons get sons hereby and those who have no wives get wives. The
diseased get themselves free from their diseases, and the man who is
under bondage, is liberated from that bondage. He who getting up early
in the morning reads this stotra of Gangâ, becomes widely known even if
he be not known at all and he becomes illumined with wisdom even if he
be quite ignorant. Even if he sees a bad dream, he acquires the merit of
bathing in the Ganges and of seeing good dreams.

 

42-44. S’rî Nârâya<u>n</u>a spoke :-- O Nârada! With this stotra (hymn)
did Bhagîratha praise the Gangâ Devî. Who then went with him to the spot
where the Sagara's sons were burnt to ashes by the curse of Kapila. By
the contact of the wind in touch with the particles of water of the
Ganges, those sons of Sagara were instantly freed of their curses and
they all repaired to Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha. She is named Bhâgirathî, because
Bhagîratha brought Her to this earth. Thus I have described to you the
story of the Ganges.

 

This anecdote is highly meritorious and the great step to liberation.
What more do you now want to hear? Say.

45-46. Nârada said :-- O Lord! How did Gangâ come to flow through the
three worlds by three routes, and thus purify them? How was she carried
and to which places? How did the people of those localities accord
respect to Her? Kindly describe all these in detail.

 

47-79. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- O Nârada! On the Full Moon night of the
month of Kârtik in the Râsa mâ<u>nd</u>alam, at the great festivity in
honour of Râdhâ, S’rî  Kri<u>sn</u>a worshipped Râdhâ and remained
there. Next Râdhâ, worshipped by S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, was worshipped by
Brahmâ and the other Devas, by Saunaka and the other Ri<u>s</u>is, who
also stopped there with much gladness. At this moment the Devî
Sarasvatî, the Presiding Deity of the Science of Music began to sing
lovely songs regarding Kri<u>sn</u>a, in tune with vocal and
instrumental music. Brahmâ became glad and presented to Sarasvatî a
necklace of jewels; Mahâ Deva gave her gems and jewels rare in this
universe; Kri<u>sn</u>a presented the best Kaustubha jewel; Râdhikâ
offered excellent invaluable necklace of jewels; Nârâya<u>n</u>a
presented to her the best and most excellent garland of jewels;
Lak<u>s</u>mî gave her invaluable golden earrings decked with gems;
Vi<u>sn</u>u-Mâyâ Mûla Prakriti, Bhagvatî Durgâ, who is Nârâya<u>n</u>î,
Îs'varî, Îs'ânî, presented Her devotion to Brahmâ, so very rare; Dharma
gave her devotion to Dharma and high fame; Agni (fire) gave her
excellent raiments purified by fire and Vâyu gave Her Nûpura (toe
ornaments) made of gems and jewels. At this time, Mahes'vara, the Lord
of Bhûtas (elements) began to sing, at the suggestion of Brahmâ, songs
relating to S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a's grand Râsa festival. Hearing this, the
Devas became very much enchanted and remained motionless like statues.
With great difficulty, they regained their consciousness. Then they saw
that there was no Râdhâ nor Kri<u>sn</u>a in this Râsa mâ<u>nd</u>ala;
everything was deluged with water. The Gopas, Gopîs, Devas and
Brâhma<u>n</u>as began to cry loudly. Brahmâ in his meditation then came
to know that Râdhâ and Kri<u>sn</u>a both have assumed this liquid
appearance for the deliverance of the people of the world. Brahmâ and
others, all began to praise S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a and said :-- “O All
prevading One! Now be pleased to show us Thy form and grant us our
desired boons.” At that instant a sweet incorporeal voice was clearly
heard by all, as coming from air above, that, “I am the Self of all,
pervading all; and this my S’akti, Râdhâ, is also the Self of all,
prevades all; so there is no separation of us from you all even for a
moment. It is only to show our favour to the devotees that we assume
special forms. For this reason only there is separation of us from you
as regards this body! There is nothing else. Besides you have no
necessity with our bodies. O Devas! Now if my Manus, men, Munis,
Vai<u>sn</u>avas and you all, purified by Mantras desire very much to
see My Form clearly, then I tell you to request Mahes'vara to carry out
My word. O Brahmâ! O Creator! Better ask

 

<span id="page_854">p. 854</span>

 

Mahâdeva, the World Teacher, that He would better compose the beautiful
Tantra S'âstra, in accordance with the limbs of the Vedas. And that the
above S'âstra be full of Mantras, capable to yield desired fruits,
Stotras (hymns) and Kavachas (protection mantras) and rules of due
worship in proper order. And that also My Mantra, My Stotra, and My
Kavacha be also given there in a hidden form. So that those people that
are sinners might not understand their real meanings and thus turn out
against Me. It may be that one in a thousand or in a hundred may worship
My Mantra. And My Mantra worshippers, the saints, become purified and
come to My Abode. If My S'âstra be not well made (i. e., if everyone be
able to understand its meaning) and if everyone be able to go from
Bhûrloka to Goloka, then Thy labour in this creation of the world will
all be in vain. Therefore dost Thou better create different worlds
according to the differences of Sâttvik, Râjasik, and Tamo Gu<u>n</u>as;
then some will be the inhabitants of this Bhûrloka, some will be the
inhabitants of Dyuloka according to their Karmas. O Brâhma<u>n</u>! If
Mahâ Deva promises earnestly in this assembly of the Devas, I will then
exhibit My True Form.” O Nârada! Thus speaking, the Eternal
Puru<u>s</u>a S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a remained silent (i. e., the aerial
incorporeal voice stopped). Hearing this, Brahmâ, the Creator of the
world, gladly informed S’iva of this. When the Lord of Knowledge, the
Foremost of the Jñânins, Bhûtanâtha heard the words of the Creator, He
took the Ganges water in His hands and swore that “I will complete the
Tantra S'astra, full of Râdhâ mantras and not opposed to the Vedas. If
one touches the Ganges water and speaks lies, one remains in the
terrible Kâlasutra hell for a period of one Brahmâ's life time.” O
Dvija! When Bhagavân S'ankara said this before the assembly of the Devas
in the region of Goloka, S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a appeared there with Râdhâ.
The Devas became exceedingly glad to see Him. They praised Him, the Best
Puru<u>s</u>a and they were all filled with rapture and again engaged
themselves in the grand Râsa Festival. Some time after, Mâhâ Deva
lighted the Torch of Mukti, i.e., the Tantra S'âstra was published by
Him, as promised. O Child! Thus I have disclosed to you this anecdote,
so very secret, and hard to be attained. Thus S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a
Himself, is verily the liquid Gangâ sprung in the region of Goloka. This
holy Gangâ, born of the bodies of Kri<u>sn</u>a and Râdhâ inseparable
from each other, grants enjoyment, lordship and liberation. S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a, the Highest Self, has placed Her in various places; so
Gangâ is of the nature of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a and is everywhere, equally
honoured everywhere in the Brahmâ<u>nd</u>a (universe).

 

Here ends the Twelfth Chapter in the Ninth Book on the origin of Gangâ
in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rîmad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
