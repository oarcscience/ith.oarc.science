**Chapter II**

 

**On the origin of Prak<u>r</u>iti and Puru<u>s</u>a**

 

<span id="page_810">p. 810</span>

 

1-4. Nârada said :-- O Lord! I have heard all that you said in brief
about the Prak<u>r</u>iti Devî. Now describe in detail. Why the Mûlâ
Prak<u>r</u>iti Âdya S’akti (the Prime Force) was created at the
beginning before the creation of this world of five elements. How did
She, being of the nature of the three Gu<u>n</u>as, come to be divided
into five parts? I desire to hear all this in detail. Now kindly
describe their auspicious births, methods of worship, their meditation,
their stotras (praises), Kavachas (the mystic syllables considered as a
preservation like armour), glory and power in detail.

 

5-26. Nârâyana spoke :-- “O Devar<u>s</u>i! The Mûlâ Prak<u>r</u>iti, of
the nature of Mâyâ of Para Brahman is an eternal entity (the nabho
ma<u>nd</u>al); Time (Kâla), the ten quarters, the Universe Egg, the
Goloka and, lower than this, the Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha Dhâma all are eternal
things. Âtman and Prak<u>r</u>iti are in inseparable union with each
other as Fire and its burning capacity, the Moon and her beauty, the
lotus and its splendour, the Sun and his rays are inseparably united
with each other. As the goldsmith cannot prepare golden orna-

ments without gold and as the potter cannot make earthen pots without
earth, so the Âtman cannot do any work without the help of this
omnipotent Prak<u>r</u>iti. The letter “Sa” indicates “Ais’yaryam”
prosperity, the divine powers; and “Kti”, denotes strength; and in as
much as She is the bestower of the above two, the Mûlâ Prak<u>r</u>iti
is named “S’akti”. “Bhaga” is indicative of knowledge, prosperity,
wealth, fame; and in as much as Mûlâ Prak<u>r</u>iti has all these
powers, She is also called “Bhagavatî”. And Âtman “is always in union
with this Bhagavatî Who is all powers, so He is called “Bhagavân’. The
Bhagavân is therefore sometimes with form; and sometimes He is without
form. (*Note* :-- When Prak<u>r</u>iti becomes latent, God is without
form; with Prakriti manifest, God is with form.) The Yogis always think
of the Luminous Form of the Formless Bhagavân and declare Him to be all
blissful Para Brahma, the God. Though He is invisible, the Witness of
all, Omniscient, the Cause of all, the Giver of everything and of every
form, yet the Vai<u>sn</u>avas do not say so. The Vai<u>sn</u>avas
declare how can fire, strength and energy come when there is no fiery,
strong, energetic Person behind it? Therefore He who shines in the
centre of this fiery sphere is the Para Brahma; He is the Fiery Person;
He is higher than the Highest. He is All Will; He is All Form, the Cause
of all causes and His Form is Very Beautiful. He is Young; He looks very
peaceful and loved by all. He is the Highest; and His Blue Body shines
like new rain-clouds. His two eyes defy the beauty of the autumn lotuses
in the mid-day; His exquisitely nice rows of teeth put all the series of
pearls in the dark back-ground. The peacock’s feather is seen on His
crown; the garland of Mâlatî flowers is suspended from His neck.; His
nose is exceedingly beautiful; the sweet smile is always seen on His
lips. There is no second like Him in showing favour to the Bhaktas. He
wears yellow clothings, as if the burning fire is emanating all round;
the flute is seen on both His hands, reaching His knees. His body is
decorated all over with jewels. He is the Sole Refuge of this Universe;
the Lord of all, omnipotent and omnipresent. No trace of deficiency can
be seen in Him; He is Himself a Siddha (perfect) Puru<u>s</u>a; and the
foremost of all Siddha Puru<u>s</u>as; bestows Siddhis to all. The
Vai<u>sn</u>avas meditate always That Eternal S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, the
Deva of the Devas. He takes away fully all the fears of birth, death,
old age, and ills and sorrows. The age of Brahmâ is the twinkling of His
eye. That Highest Self, the Para Brahma is denominated as Kri<u>sn</u>a.
The word “Kri<u>s</u>” denotes Bhakti to S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a and the
letter “<u>n</u>a” signifies devotion to His service. So He is the
Bestower of Bhakti and devotion to His service. Again “Kri<u>s</u>”
denotes all; everything; and

 

<span id="page_812">p. 812</span>

 

“<u>n</u>a” signifies the root. So He Who is the Root and Creator of
all, is S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a. When He desired, in the very beginning, to
create this Universe, there was nothing then except S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a;
and at last, impelled by Kâla (His Own Creation), He became ready, in
His part, to do the work of creation.

 

27-61. The Lord, who is All Will, willed and divided Himself into two
parts, His Left part becoming female and His Right part becoming male.
Then that Eternal One, Who is greatly loving, looked at the female, His
left part, the Sole Receptacle to hold all the contents of love, very
lovely to the eyes, and looking like the beautiful lotus. The loins of
this woman defy the Moon; Her thighs put the plaintain trees quite in
the background; Her breasts are mistaken for the beautiful Bel fruits;
flowers are scattered as Her Hairs on the head; Her middle part is very
slender, very beautiful to behold! Exceedingly lovely; appearance very
calm; sweet smile reigning in Her lips; side long glances with Her; Her
clothing is purified with fire; all over Her body decorated with gems.
Her eyes, also, like the Chakora bird (Greek partridge) began to drink
incessantly with joy the moon beams from the face of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a,
defying, as it were, the ten millions of moons. On Her forehead there
was the dot of vermillion (red-lead); over that, the dot of white sandal
paste and over that was placed the musk. The fillets or braids of hair
on Her head are slightly curved; this was decorated with Mâlatî
garlands; on Her neck was suspended the necklace of gems and jewels and
She is always very amorous towards Her husband. On looking at Her face,
it seems that ten millions of moons have arisen at once; when She walks,
Her gait puts (humiliates) those of ganders and elephants in the shade.
O Muni! S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, the Lord of the Râsa Dance, and the Person
of Taste in the Râsa sport, looked askance at Her for a while and then
catching hold of Her by Her hand went to the Râsama<u>nd</u>alam and
began to play the Râsa sport (the amorous pastime). It seemed then the
Lord of amorous pastimes had become incarnate there and had been
enjoying the various pleasures of amorous passions and desires. So much,
that Brahma’s one day passed away in that sport. The Father of the
Universe, then becoming tired, impregnated in an auspicious moment in
Her womb who was born of His left portion. The Prak<u>r</u>iti Devî was
also tired of the embraces of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a; so after the
intercourse, she began to perspire and breathe frequently. Her
perspiration turned into water and deluged the whole universe, with
water; and Her breath turned into air and became the life of all beings.
The female that sprung from the left side of Vâyu became his wife and
out of their contact originated Prâ<u>n</u>a, Apâna,

 

<span id="page_813">p. 813</span>

 

Samâna, Udâna and Vyâna, the five sons. These are the five vital Vâyus
of all the beings. Besides these from the womb of the Vâyu’s wife came
out Nâga and the other four lower Vâyus. The water that came out from
perspiration, Vara<u>n</u>a Deva became the Presiding Deity of that; and
the female, sprung out of the left side of Varu<u>n</u>a Deva, became
the wife of Varu<u>n</u>a, called Varu<u>n</u>ânî. On the other hand,
the S’akti, of the nature of knowledge of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, remained
pregnant for one hundred manvantaras. Her body became effulgent with
Brahma-teja (the fire of Brahma). Kri<u>sn</u>a was Her life and She
again was dearer to Kri<u>sn</u>a than his life even. She remained
always with S’rî Krisna; so much so that She constantly rested on His
breast. When one hundred manvantaras passed away, that Beautiful One
gave birth to a Golden Egg. That egg was the repository of the whole
universe. The Beloved of Kri<u>sn</u>a became very sorry to see the egg
and out of anger, threw that within the water collected in the centre of
the Universe. Seeing this, S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a raised a great cry and
immediately cursed Her duly and said :-- “O Angry One! O Cruel One! When
you have forsaken out of anger this son just born of you, I say then
that you become from today bereft of any issue. Besides, let all those
godly women that will spring out of your parts, they also be deprived of
having any issue or sons and they will remain ever constant in their
youth. O Muni! While S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a was thus cursing, suddenly came
out from the tongue of the beloved of Kri<u>sn</u>a, a beautiful
daughter, of a white colour. Her clothings were all white, in her hands
there were lute and book and all Her body was decorated with ornaments
made of gems and jewels. She was the Presiding Deity of all the
S’âstras. Some time later the Mûla Prak<u>r</u>iti, the Beloved of
Kri<u>sn</u>a divided into two parts. Out of Her left portion came
Kamalâ and out of Her right portion came Râdhikâ. In the meantime S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a divided Himself into two parts. From his right side
appeared a form two-handed; and from the left side appeared a form
four-handed. Then S’rî Krisna addressed the Goddess Speech, holding
flute in Her hand, “O Devî! You follow this four-handed Person as his
wife” and then spoke to Râdhâ :-- “O Râdhe! You are a sensitive, proud
lady; let you be My wife; so it will do you good”. S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a
also told Lak<u>s</u>mî gladly to become the wife of the four-handed
Nârâyana. Then Nârâyana, the Lord of the world, took both Lak<u>s</u>mî
and Sarasvatî to the abode Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha. O Muni! Both Lak<u>s</u>mî
and Sarasvatî became issueless, being born of Râdhâ. From the body of
Nârâya<u>n</u>a arose his attendants, all four-handed. They were all
equal to Him in appearance, in qualifications; in spirit and in age. On
the other hand, from the body of Kamalâ arose millions of female
attendants all equal to Her in form and qualifications. Then

 

<span id="page_814">p. 814</span>

 

 arose innumerable Gopas (cow-herds) from the pores of S’rî
Kri<u>sn</u>a. They were all equal to the Lord of Goloka in form,
Gu<u>n</u>as, power and age; they were all dear to Him as if they were
His life.

 

62-88. From the pores of Râdhikâ came out the Gopa Kanyâs
(cow-herdesses). They were all equal to Râdhâ and all were Her
attendants and were sweet-speaking. Their bodies were all decorated with
ornaments of jewels, and their youth was constant, they were all
issueless as S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a had cursed them thus. O Best of
Brâhma<u>n</u>as! On the other hand, suddenly arose Durgâ, the Mâyâ of
Vi<u>sn</u>u (The Highest Self) eternal and whose Deity was
Kri<u>sn</u>a. (*N. B*. Durgâ was the Avatâra of Mûla Prak<u>r</u>iti
not the Avatâra of Râdhâ as Lak<u>s</u>mî and Sarasvatî were.) She is
Nârâyanî; She is Îs’ânî; She is the S’akti of all and She is the
Presiding Deity of the intelligence of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a. From Her have
come out many other Devîs; She is Mûla Prak<u>r</u>iti and She is
Îs’varî; no failings or insufficiencies are seen in Her. She is the
Tejas (of the nature of Fire) and She is of the nature of the three
Gu<u>n</u>as. Her colour is bright like the molten gold; Her lustre
looks as if ten millions of Suns have simultaneously arisen. She looks
gracious always with sweet smile on Her lips, Her hands are one thousand
in number. Various weapons are in all Her hands. The clothings of the
three-eyed one are bright and purified by Fire. She is decorated with
ornaments all of jewels. All the women who are the jewels are sprung
from Her parts and parts of parts and by the power of Her Mâyâ, all the
people of the world are enchanted. She bestows all the wealth that a
householder wants; She bestows on Kri<u>sn</u>a’s devotees, the devotion
towards Kri<u>sn</u>a; nay, She is the Vai<u>sn</u>avî S’akti of the
Vai<u>sn</u>avas. She gives final liberation to those that want such and
gives happiness to those that want happiness. She is the Laksmî of the
Heavens; as well She is the Laksmî of every household. She is the Tapas
of the ascetics, the beauty of the kingdoms of the kings, the burning
power of fire, the brilliancy of the Sun, the tender beauty of the Moon,
the lovely beauty of the lotus and the S’akti of S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a the
Highest Self. The Self, the world all are powerful by Her S’akti;
without Her everything would be a dreary dead mass. O Nârada! She is the
seed of this Tree of World; She is eternal; She is the Stay, She is
Intelligence, fruits, hunger, thirst, mercy, sleep, drowsiness,
forgiveness, fortitude, peace, bashfulness, nourishment, contentment and
lustre. The Mûla Prak<u>r</u>iti praising S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a stood
before Him. The Lord of Râdhikâ then gave Her a throne to sit. O Great
Muni! At this moment sprang from the navel lotus the four-faced Brahmâ,
with his wife Sâvitrî, an exceedingly beautiful woman. No sooner the
four-faced Brahmâ,

 

<span id="page_815">p. 815</span>

 

the foremost of the Jñânins, fond of asceticism and holding
Kaman<u>d</u>alu in His hand came into being than He began to praise
S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a by His four mouths. On the other hand the Devî
Sâvitrî, with a beauty of one hundred moons, born with great ease,
wearing apparel purified by fire and decorated with various ornaments
praised Kri<u>sn</u>a, the One and Only Cause of the Universe and then
took Her seat gladly with Her husband in the throne made of jewels. At
that time Kri<u>sn</u>a divided Himself into two parts; His left side
turned into the forn of Mahâdeva; and His right side turned into the
Lord of Gopikâs (cow-herdesses). The colour and splendour of the body of
Mahâdeva is pure white like white crystal; as if one hundred suns have
arisen simultaneously. In His hands there are the trident (Tris’ul) and
sharp-edged spear (Patti<u>s</u>a); He is wearing a tiger skin; on His
head is matted hair (Ja<u>t</u>â) of a tawny hue like molten gold; His
body was besmeared all over with ashes, smile reigning in His face and
on His forehead, the semi-moon. He has no clothing on His loins; so He
is called Digambara (the quarters of the Sky being His clothing); His
neck is of a blue colour; the serpent being the ornaments on His body
and on His right hand the nice bead of jewels well purified. Who is
always repeating with His five faces the Eternal Light of Brahmâ, and
Who has conquered Death by praising S’rî Kri<u>sn</u>a, Who is of the
nature of Truth, the Highest Self, the God Incarnate, the material cause
of all things and the All auspicious of all that is good and favourable,
and the Destroyer of the fear of birth, death, old age, and disease and
Who has been named Mrityunjaya (the conqueror of Death). This Mahâdeva
took His seat on a throne made of jewels (diamonds, emeralds, etc.).

 

Here ends the Second Chapter of the Ninth Book on the origin of
Prak<u>r</u>iti and Puru<u>s</u>a in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad
Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
