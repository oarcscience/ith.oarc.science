1-11. Nârada said :-- O Dvaipâyana! When the King Tâladhvaja asked me
thus, I thought over earnestly and said thus :-- “I do not know whose
daughter I am; nor do I know quite certainly where are my father and
mother; one man placed me here on this tank and has gone away, whither I
do not know. O King! I am now an helpless orphan; what shall I do now?
Where to go? What to do by which I can have my welfare? I am all the
while thinking on these. O King! The Destiny is powerful; I have not the
least control over it; you know Dharma and you are a King. Do now as you
like. O King! Do nourish me; I have no father, no mother, nor any
acquaintances and friends; there is no place for me also to stand on;
therefore I am now your dependent.” When I spoke thus, the King looked
at my face and became love-stricken for me; he then told his attendants
to bring an excellent rectangular and spacious palanquin to be carried
on four men’s shoulders, gilt and adorned with jewels and pearls, where
soft sheets were spread inside and covered all over with silken cloths.
Instantly the servants went away and brought for me a beautiful
palanquin. I got on it to serve the best wishes of the King. The King
also gladly took me home. In an auspicious day and in an auspicious
moment he married me in accordance with due rites and ceremonies in the
presence of the Holy Fire.

 

12\. I became dearer to him than even his own life and the King, with
great fondness, kept my name as Saubhâgya Sundarî.

 

13-20. The King then began to sport with me amorously according to the
rules of the Kâma S’âstra in various ways and with great enjoyments and
pleasures. He then left all his kingly duties and state affairs and he
began to remain day and night with me deeply immersed in amorous sports;

so much his mind was merged in me in these plays that he could not
notice the long time that passed away in the interval. He used to drink
the Vâru<u>n</u>î wine and, forsaking all the state affairs, began to
enjoy me in nice gardens, beautiful lakes, lovely palaces, beautified
houses, excellent mountains and enviable forests and became completely
subservient to me. O Dvaipâyana! Being incessantly engaged with the King
in amorous sports and remaining obedient to him, my previous body, male
ideas, or the birth of Muni, nothing whatsoever came in my memory. I
remained always attached to him, being obedient to him with a view to be
happy and I constantly thought over “that this King is very much
attached to me, I am his dearest wife to all others; always he thinks of
me, I am his chief consort, capable to give him enjoyment.” My mind
became entirely his and I completely forgot the eternal Brahmajñân and
the knowledge of the Dharma S’âstras.

 

21-31. O Muni! Thus engaged in various amorous sports, twelve years
passed away as if a moment and I could not perceive that. Then I became
pregnant; and the King became very glad and performed all the ceremonies
pertaining to my impregnation and holding of the child in my womb. In
order to satisfy me, the King used to ask me always what things I liked;
I used to be very much abashed; seeing this, the King used to be still
more glad. Ten months thus passed away and in an auspicious Lagna and
when the asterism was favourably strong, I gave birth to a son; the King
became very glad and great festivities were held on the birth ceremony
of the child. O Dvaipâyana! When the period of the birth-impurity was
over, the King saw the face of the child and was greatly delighted; I
then became the dearest wife of the King. Two years after again I became
impregnated; the second auspicious son was born. The King gave the name
Sudhanvâ to the second son and on the authority of the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s,
kept the name of the eldest son as Vîravarmâ. Thus I gave birth to
twelve sons, in due course of time, to the King’s great liking; and I
was engaged in rearing up those children and thus I remained enchanted.
Again in due course, I gave birth to eight sons; thus my household was
filled with happiness. The King performed the marriage ceremonies of all
those children duly and befittingly; and our family became very large
with sons and their wives.

 

32-52. Then I had some grandsons and they increased my attachment and
the consequent delusion with their all sorts of playful sports.
Sometimes I felt happy and prosperous and sometimes I felt pain and
sorrow when my sons fell ill. Then my body and mind became very much
troubled with sorrows. Again the quarrels amongst my sons and my
daughters-in-

law, brought terrible pain and remorse in my mind. O Best of Munis! Thus
I was greatly immersed in the terrible ocean of these imaginary
thoughts, sometimes happy and sometimes painful, and I forgot my
previous knowledge and the knowledge of the S’âstras. I was merged in
the thought of myself being a woman and lost myself entirely in doing
the household affairs. I began to think “that I have so many
daughters-in-law; so many powerful sons of mine are playing together in
my house; Oh! I am fortunate and full of merits amongst women” and thus
my egoistic pride increased. Not for a moment even occurred the thought
that I had been Nârada; the Bhagavân had deceived me by His Mâyâ. O
Kri<u>sn</u>a Dvaipâyana! I was deluded by Mâyâ and passed away my time
in the thought “that I am the king’s wife, chaste and of good conduct
following good Âchâra; I have so many sons and grandsons; I am blessed
in this Samsâra and that I am so happy and prosperous.” One powerful
king of a distant country turned out an inveterate enemy of my husband
and came to the city of Kanauj to fight with my husband, accompanied by
chariots, and elephants and the fourfold army. That enemy besieged the
city with his army; my sons and grandsons went out and fought valiantly
with him but owing to the great Destiny, the enemies killed all my sons.
The King retreated and returned to his palace. Next I heard that
powerful King killed all my sons and grandsons and had gone back to his
country with his army. I then hurriedly went to the battlefield, crying
loudly. O Long-lived One! Seeing my sons and grandsons lying on the
ground, in that horrible and distressed state, I became merged in the
ocean of sorrows and lamented and wept loudly and wildly, “O my Sons!
Where have you gone leaving me thus? Alas! The pernicious Fate is very
dominant, and very painsgiving and indomitable. It has killed me today.”
By this time, the Bhagavân Madhusûdana came to me there in the garb of a
beautiful aged Brâhmi<u>n</u>. His dress was sacred and lovely; it
seemed he was versed in the Vedas. Seeing me weeping distressedly in the
battlefield he said :-- “O Devî! O cuckoo-voiced One! It seems you are
the mistress of a prosperous house and you have got husband and sons! O
thin-bodied One! Why are you thus lamenting and feeling yourself
distressed! All this is simply illusion caused by Moha; think; who are
you? whose sons are these? Now think of your best hereafter; Don’t weep,
get up and be comfortable, O Good-eyed one!

 

53-54. O Devî! To shew respect to your sons, etc., gone to the other
worlds, offer them water and Til. The friends of the deceased ought to
take their bath in a place of pilgrimage; never they should bathe in
their houses. Know this as ordained by Dharma.

55-66. Nârada said :-- O Dvaipâyan! When the old Brâhmi<u>n</u> thus
addressed me, I and the King and other friends got up. The Bhagavân
Madhusûdana causing this creation, in the form of a Brâhma<u>n</u>a, led
the way and I followed him quickly to that sacred place of pilgrimage.
The Vi<u>sn</u>u Bhagavân, the Lord Janârdana Hari, in the form of a
Brâhmi<u>n</u>, kindly took me to the tank named Pumtîrtha (male tîrtha)
and said :-- “O One going like an elephant! Better take your bath in
this tank; forego your sorrows that are of no use; now the time has
arrived to offer water to your sons. Better think that you had millions
of sons born to you in your previous births and for that your millions
of sons and daughters lost their lives; you had millions of fathers,
husbands, and brothers and you lost them again; O Devî! Now tell me for
whom you will now grieve? All these, then, are merely mental phenomena;
this world is full of delusion, false like a mirage and dream-like; the
embodied souls, simply get pains and sorrows and nothing else.” Nârada
said :-- On hearing his words, I went to bathe in that Pumtîrtha, as
ordered by him. Taking a dip, I found that, in an instant, I became a
man; the Bhagavân Hari, in his own proper form, was standing on the edge
with a lute in his hand. O Brâhmi<u>n</u>! When getting out of the
water, I came to the bank and saw the lotus-eyed Kri<u>sn</u>a, pure
consciousness then flashed in my heart. Then I thought “that I am
Nârada; I have come to this place and being deluded by the Mâyâ of Hari,
I got the female form.” When I was thinking thus, Hari exclaimed, “O
Nârada! Get up; what are you doing, standing in the water?” I was
astonished; and, recollecting my feminine nature, very severe indeed,
began to think why I was again transformed into a male form.

 

Here ends the Twenty-ninth Chapter of the Sixth Book on the Nârada’s
getting again his male form in the Mahâpurâ<u>n</u>am S’rî Mad Devî
Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
