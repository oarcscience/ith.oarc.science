**Chapter XXIX**

 

**On the anecdote of Sâvitrî, on gifts and on the effects of Karmas**

 

<span id="page_914">p. 914</span>

 

1\. Nârâya<u>n</u>a said :-- Yama got thunderstruck at these queries of
Sâvitrî. He then began to describe, with a smiling countenance, the
fruition of the several works of the Jîvas.

 

2-8. He said :-- “O Child! You are now a daughter only twelve years old.
But you speak of wisdom like the Highest Jñânins and Yogis, Sanaka and
others. O Child! By virtue of the boon granted by Sâvitrî, you have
become incarnate of Her in part. The King As’vapati got you before by
performing severe penances. As Lak<u>s</u>mî is dear and fortunate with
regard to Vi<u>sn</u>u, as Mahâdevi is to Mahâdeva, Aditi to Kas’yapa,
Ahalyâ to Gautama, so you are to Satyavâna in respect of affection and
good-luck and other best qualities. As S’achî is to Mahendra, as
Rohi<u>n</u>î is to Moon, as Rati is to Kâma, as Svâhâ is to Fire, as
Svadhâ is to the Pitris, as Sanjñâ is to the Sun, as Varu<u>n</u>ânî is
to Varu<u>n</u>a, as Dak<u>s</u>i<u>n</u>â is to Yajñâ, as Earth is to
Varâha, as Devasenâ is to Kârtika, so you are fortunate and blessed with
respect to Satyavâna. O Sâvitrî! I myself grant you this boon of my own
accord. Now ask other boons. O highly fortunate One! I will fulfil all
your desires.”

 

9-12. Sâvitrî said :-- “O Noble One! Let there be one hundred sons of
mine by Satyavâna. This is the boon that I want. Let there be one
hundred sons of my Father as well; let my Father-in-law get back his
(lost) eyesight and may he get back his lost kingdom. This is another
boon that I want. Thou art the Lord of the world. So grant me this boon,
too, that I may have this my very body for a lakh years when I may go to
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha with Satyavâna. Now I am eager to hear the various
fruitions of Karmas of several Jîvas. Kindly narrate them and oblige.”

 

13-70. Dharma said :-- You are very chaste. So what you have thought
will verily come to pass. Now I describe the fruition of Karmas of the
Jîvas. Listen. Excepting this holy land of Bhârata, nowhere do the
people enjoy wholly the fruition of their two-fold Karmas, good and bad.
It is only the Suras, Daityas, Dânavas, Gandharvas, Râk<u>s</u>asas, and
men that do Karmas. The beasts and the other Jîvas do not do Karmas. The
special Jîvas, e.g., men, etc., experience the fruition of their Karmas
in Heavens, hells and in all the other Yonis (wombs). Specially, as the
Jîvas

roam in all the different Yonis, they enjoy their Karmas, good or bad,
as the case may be, carved in their previous births. The good works get
fructified in Heavens; and the bad works lead the Jîvas to hells. This
Karma can be got rid of by Bhakti. This Bhakti is of two kinds :-- (1)
Nirgu<u>n</u>â of the nature of Nirvâ<u>n</u>a; and (2) towards
Prakriti, of the astute of Brahmâ, and with Mâyâ inherent. Diseases come
as the result of bad and ignorant actions and healthiness comes from
good and certain scientific Karmas. Similar are the remarks for short
and long lives for happiness and pain. By bad works, one becomes blind
or deformed in body. So by doing excellent Karmas, one acquires Siddhis,
etc.. These are spoken generally. I will now speak in detail; listen.
This is very secret even in Purâ<u>n</u>as and Smritis. In this
Bhâratavar<u>s</u>a men are the best of all the various classes of
beings. The Brâhma<u>n</u>s are the best of men and are best in all
Kinds of Karmas. They are responsible, too, for their actions. O Chaste
One! Of the Brâhmi<u>n</u>s, again, those that are attached to the
Brâhma<u>n</u>as are the best. The Brâhma<u>n</u>as are of two kinds as
they are Sakâma (with desires) or Ni<u>s</u>kâma (without desires). The
Ni<u>s</u>kâmî Brâhma<u>n</u>as are superior to the Sakâmî
Brâhma<u>n</u>as. For the Sakâmîs are to enjoy the fruits of their
Karmas, while the Ni<u>s</u>kâmî Brâhma<u>n</u>as are perfectly free
from any such disturbances (they have not to come back to this field of
Karma). The Ni<u>s</u>kâma Bhakta after they quit their bodies, go to a
place free from sickness or disease, pure and perfect. From there they
do not come back. The Ni<u>s</u>kâma Bhaktas assuming the divine forms
go to the Goloka and worship the Highest God, the Highest Self, the
two-armed Kri<u>sn</u>a. The Sakâmî Vai<u>sn</u>avas go to
Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha; but they come back in Bhârata and get into the wombs
of the twice-born. By degrees they also become Ni<u>s</u>kâma when they
certainly acquire pure undefiled Bhakti. The Brâhma<u>n</u>as and
Vai<u>sn</u>avas that are Sakâmîs in all the births, never get that pure
undefiled intellect and never get the devotion to Vi<u>sn</u>u. The
Brâhma<u>n</u>as, living in the Tîrthas (sacred places of pilgrimages)
and attached to Tapas go to Brahmaloka (the region of Brahmâ); they
again come down to Bhârata. Those that are devotedly attached to their
own Dharma (religion) and reside in places other than Tîrthas, go to
Satyaloka and again come to Bhârata. The Brâhma<u>n</u>as, following
their own Dharma and devoted to the Sun go to the world of the Sun and
again come to Bhârata. And those who are devoted to Mûla Prakriti and
devoted to Ni<u>s</u>kâma Dharma go to Ma<u>n</u>i Dvîpa and have not to
come back from thither. The Bhaktas of S’iva, S’akti, and Gane’sa, and
attached to their own Dharmas respectively go to the S’iva Loka and
return from thence. Those Brâhma<u>n</u>as that worship the other Devas
and attached to their

 

<span id="page_916">p. 916</span>

 

own Dharmas go to those regions of theirs respectively and again come to
Bhârata. Attached to their own Dharmas, the Ni<u>s</u>kâmî Bhaktas of
Hari go by their Bhakti step by step to the region of S’rî Hari. Those
that are not attached to their own Dharmas and do not worship the Devas
and always bent on doing things as they like without any regard to their
Âchâras go certainly to hells. No doubt in this. The Brâhma<u>n</u>as
and the other three Var<u>n</u>as, attached to their own Dharmas all
enjoy the fruits of their good works. But those who do not do their
Svadharma, go verily down into hells. They do not came to Bhârata for
their rebirth, they enjoy their fruits of Karmas in hells! Therefore the
four Var<u>n</u>as ought to follow their own Dharmas of the
Brâhma<u>n</u>as, they are to remain attached to their own Dharmas and
give their daughters in marriage to the similarly qualified
Brâhma<u>n</u>as. They then go to the Chandraloka (the region of the
Moon). There they remain for the life periods of the fourteen Indras.
And if the girl be given, with ornaments, the results obtained would be
twice. If the girl be given with a desire in view, then that world is
obtained; but if the girl be given without any desire but to fulfil the
God’s will and God’s satisfaction only, then one would not have to go to
that world. They go to Vi<u>sn</u>u Loka, bereft of the fruits of all
Karmas. Those that give to the Brâhma<u>n</u>as pasture ground and
cattle, silver, gold, garment, fruits and water, go to the Chandraloka
and live there for one Manvantara. They live long in those regions by
virtue of that merit. Again those that give gold, cows, copper, etc., to
the holy Brâhma<u>n</u>as, go to the Sûrya Loka (the region of the Sun)
and live there for one Ayuta years (10,000 years), free from diseases,
etc., for a long time. Those that give lands and lots of wealth to the
Brâhmi<u>n</u>s, go to the Vi<u>sn</u>u Loka and to the beautiful S’veta
Dvîpa (one of the eighteen minor divisions of the known continents). And
there they live as long as the Sun and Moon exist. O Muni! The
meritorious persons live long in that wide region. Note :-- S’veta Dvîpa
may mean Vaiku<u>nt</u>ha, where Vi<u>sn</u>u resides. Those who give
with devotion dwelling places to the Brâhma<u>n</u>as, go to the happy
Vi<u>sn</u>u Loka. And there, in that great Vi<u>sn</u>u Loka, they live
for years equal to the number of molecules, in that house. He who offers
a dwelling house in honour of any Deva, goes to the region of that Deva
and remains there for a number of years equivalent to the number of
particles in that house. The lotus-born Brahmâ said that if one offers a
royal palace, one obtains a result four times and if one offers a
country, one gets the result one hundred times that; again if one offers
an excellent country, twice as much merit one acquires. One who
dedicates a tank for the expiation of

 

<span id="page_917">p. 917</span>

 

all one’s sins, one lives in Janar Loka (one of the pious regions) for a
period equivalent to the number of particles therein). If any man offers
a Vâpî (a well) in preference to other gifts, one gets ten fold fruits
thereby. If one offers seven Vâpîs, one acquires the fruits of offering
one tank. A Vâpî is one which is four thousand Dhanus long and which is
as much wide or less (Note :-- Dhanu equals a measure of four hastas).
If offered to a good bridegroom, then the giving of a daughter in
marriage is equivalent to a dedication of ten Vâpîs. And if the girl be
offered with ornaments, twice the merits accrue. The same merit accrues
in clearing the bed of the mud of a pond as in digging it. So for the
Vâpî (well). O Chaste One! He who plants an As’vattha tree and dedicates
it to a godly purpose, lives for one Ayuta years in Tapar Loka. O
Sâvitrî! He who dedicates a flower garden for the acquirement of all
sorts of good, lives for one Ayuta years in Dhruva Loka.

 

O Chaste One! He who gives a Vîmâna (any sort of excellent carriage) in
honour of Vi<u>sn</u>u, in this Hindoosthân, lives for one Manvantara in
Vis<u>nu</u>loka. And if one gives a Vîmâna of variegated colours and
workmanship, four times the result accrues. And one who gives a
palanquin, acquires half the fruits. Again if anybody gives, out of
devotion, a swinging temple (the Dol Mandir) to Bhagavân S’rî Hari,
lives for one hundred Manvantras, in the region of Vi<u>sn</u>u. O
Chaste One! He who makes a gift of a royal road, decorated with palatial
buildings on either side, lives with great honour and love in that
Indraloka for one Ayuta years. Equal results follow whether the above
things are offered to the Gods or to the Brâhma<u>n</u>as. He enjoys
that which he gives. No giving, no enjoying. After enjoying the heavenly
pleasures, etc., the virtuous person takes birth in Bhârata as a
Brâhmi<u>n</u> or in other good families, in due order, and ultimately
in the Brâhma<u>n</u>a families. The virtuous Brâhma<u>n</u>a, after he
has enjoyed the heavenly pleasures, takes his birth again in Bhârata in
Brâhma<u>n</u>a, K<u>s</u>attriya or in Vais’ya families. A
K<u>s</u>attriya or a Vais’ya can never obtain Brâhma<u>n</u>ahood, even
if he performs asceticism for one Ko<u>t</u>i Kalpas. This is stated in
the S’rutis. Without enjoying the fruits, no Karma can be exhausted even
in one hundred Ko<u>t</u>i Kalpas. So the fruits of the Karmas must be
enjoyed, whether they be auspicious or inauspicious. By the help of
seeing the Devas and seeing the Tîrthas again and again, purity is
acquired. O Sâvitrî! So now I have told you something. What more d o you
want to hear? Say.

 

Here ends the Twenty-Ninth Chapter of the Ninth Book on the anecdote of
Sâvitrî on the fruits of making gifts and on the effects of Karmas in
S’rî Mad Devî Bhâgavatam of 18,000 verses by Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
