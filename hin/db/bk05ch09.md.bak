1-22. Vyâsa said :-- On hearing Vi<u>sn</u>u's words, the Devas became
very glad and presented immediately their own weapons, ornaments and
clothings. The K<u>s</u>iroda (Milk) Ocean presented to Her gladly, the
well fitted necklace, clear as crystal, and a pair of divine cloths, of
a red colour, never becoming old and very fine. Vis'vakarmâ was very
much gratified in his heart and presented a divine jewel to be worn in
Her diadem or crest blazing like hundreds of suns; white earrings;
bracelets for Her wrist, bracelets for Her upper arm, and other
bracelets decked with various gems and jewels and anklets brilliant like
gems, of a clear Sun-like lustre, decked with jewels, and tinkling
nicely. The architect of the gods, the ocean of intellect, Vis’vakarmâ
gave Her as offerings beautiful ornaments also for the neck, all very
beautiful, as well as for the fingers decked with gems and jewels, all
shining splendidly. Varu<u>n</u>a gave for Her head garland of lotuses,
never fading away, of such a sweet fragrance as bees constantly hover
round them and the Vaijayantî garland for Her breast. The mountain
Himâlyâ gladly offered Her various gems and a beautiful lion, of a
golden colour for Her conveyance. Then that beautiful Lady, having all
the auspicious signs, wishing welfare to all, and decorated with the
divine ornaments began to look grand and splendid, mounted on Her
conveyance, the Lion. Vi<u>sn</u>u then created another thousand spoked
discus (Chakram) from His own Chakra, capable to take off the head of
any Asura, and offered it to Her. S’ankara created another excellent
Tris'ûla from his own Trident, terrible and demon-killing, and offered
it to the Devî. Varu<u>n</u>a created another bright conch from his own
conch and offered it gladly to the Devî. Fire offered Her a weapon named
S'ataghni which kills violently the demons, as if that is another god of
death. Maruta (wind), the chief of the gods, offered Her a wonderful bow
and arrow case filled with arrows. The bow can be drawn with great
difficulty and emits a very harsh sound. Indra created another dreadful
thunderbolt from his own thunderbolt and gave it at once to the Devî; as
well the beautiful sonorous bell that used to hang from the elephant

Airâvata. Yama, the God of Death, created another beautiful staff from
his own sceptre which takes away when time comes, the life of all
beings. Brahmâ gladly gave Her a divine Kamandalu, filled with the
Ganges water; and Varu<u>n</u>a offered Her a weapon called Pâs'a. O
King! Time gave Her an axe and a shield and Vis'vakarmâ gave Her a sharp
Paras'u. Kuvera, the Lord of wealth, gave her a golden drinking cup,
filled with wine; and Vâru<u>n</u>a offered Her a divine beautiful
lotus. Vis'vakarmâ became very glad and gave Her the Kaumodakî gadâ,
capable to kill the enemy of the gods and whence hundreds of bells are
hanging, an impenetrable armour and various other weapons. The Sun gave
to the Divine Mother his own rays. The Devas, seeing Her adorned with
ornaments and weapons, began to praise and chant hymns to that most
Auspicious Goddess, the Great Enchantress of the three worlds.

 

23-29. The Deva said :-- “Salutation to S'iva, Salutation to the Most
Auspicious; Thou art peace and nourishment; we salute again and again to
Thee. Salutation to Thee, the Bhagavatî Devî; Thou art the Goddess
Rudrânî (the terrible), we always salute again and again to Thee. Thou
art the Kâlarâtri (the night of destruction at the end of the world);
Thou art the Indrânî. Thou art the Mother, we salute again and again to
Thee; Thou art the success, Thou art the intelligence, Thou art the
growth, Thou art the Vaisnavî; salutation again and again to Thee. Thou
art within the earth; yet the earth does know know Thee. Thou art again
the inmost of the earth and controllest the things within this earth; we
offer our salutations to that Supreme Cause, the Highest Goddess. Thou
art within this Mâyâ (the unborn) yet the Mâyâ does not know Thee. Thou
residest again within the innermost of the Mâyâ and directest that
Unborn One, the Mâyâ, we salute again and again to that Supreme Cause,
the Great Directress, the S'ivâ (the most auspicious). O Mother! Do what
is good to us; we are oppressed by our enemy, dost then protect us; by
Thy own power dost Thou overpower and kill that Mahi<u>s</u>a. That
demon is vulnerable by woman only, he is deceitful, cunning, dreadful,
and swollen with pride on his having got the blessing; he assumes many
forms and torments the Devas. O One, devoted to the Bhaktas! Thou art
the only refuge of all the gods; O Thou art the supreme goddess, we are
very much harassed and oppressed by the Dânava; therefore dost Thou now
protect us; we bow down to Thee.”

 

30\. Vyâsa said :-- When the Devas had praised thus, the Highest
Goddess, the Giver of all happiness, then smilingly said in the
following auspicious terms :--

 

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

 

31\. “O Devas! Today in the battle ground I will overpower that wicked
Mahi<u>s</u>a, of cruel disposition and take away his life.”

 

32-40. Vyâsa said :-- Speaking thus in a melodious voice, the Supreme
One smiled and again said :-- “This world is all full of error and
delusion. Really, it is very wonderful that Brahmâ, Vi<u>sn</u>u, Indra
and other gods are all shuddering out of fear from Mahi<u>s</u>a Dânava.
The power of Destiny is exceedingly great and terrible; its influence
cannot be overcome even by the best of the Devas. O king! The Time is
the Lord of happiness and pain; Time is, therefore, the God. The wonder
is this that even those who can create, preserve and destroy this world,
they are being overpowered and tormented by Mahi<u>s</u>a. The Devî,
thinking thus, smiled; then laughed and laughed very hoarsely; it seemed
that a roar of laughter then arose. And the Dânavas were struck with
terror at that very dreadful sound. The earth trembled at that
extraordinary sound; the mountains began to move and the vast oceans
that remained calm began to be agitated with billows. The uproar filled
all the quarters and the mountain Meru trembled. Then the Dânavas,
hearing the tumultuous uproar, were all filled with tremendous fear. The
Devas became very glad and said thus :-- “O Devî! Let victory be Yours;
save us.” The intoxicated Mahi<u>s</u>a, too, hearing those words,
became very angry. Mahi<u>s</u>a, struck with terror at those words,
asked the Daityas “O Messengers! Go and ascertain how has originated
this sound.

 

41-48. Who has made this harsh sound? Bring that devil who has made this
hoarse noise, be he a Deva, Dânava, or anyone else unto me and I will
kill that roaring villain, who, it seems, has been puffed with egoism
and vanity. The Devas are not making this noise, for they are vanquished
and terror-stricken; The Asuras are not doing so, for they are my
subjects; then, who is the stupid fellow that has done so? Surely he is
of very little understanding; his days are numbered; and I will carry
him to the home of Death. Go you, ascertain the cause of sound and come
back to me; then I will go there and destroy that wretch who made this
noise to no purpose.” Vyâsa said :-- No sooner the messengers heard
these words of Mahi<u>s</u>a, than they at once went to the Devî and saw
that Her body and the several parts thereof were all very beautiful; She
had eighteen hands, She was decorated completely with various ornaments
all over Her body, all the auspicious signs were being seen in Her body
and that She was holding excellent divine weapons. That auspicious
Goddess beautiful, was holding in Her hands, the cup and drinking wine
again and again. Beholding Her this form, they were afraid and fled at
once to the Mahi<u>s</u>a and informed him the cause of that sound.

49-54. The Daityas said :-- “O Lord! We have seen one grown up woman;
whose whereabouts we are quite ignorant. The Devî is decorated with
jewels and ornaments all over Her body; She is not human nor Asurî but
Her form is extraordinary and beautiful. That noble Lady is mounted on a
lion, holding weapons on all Her eighteen hands and is roaring loudly;
She is drinking wine; so it seems that She is puffed up with liquor. It
is quite certain that She has no husband. The Devas are gladly chanting
praises from the celestial space that Let Victory be to Her side and
that She save the Devas, O Lord! We don't know at all who is that
handsome woman? or whose wife is she; why has she come there? and what
is Her motive? Sentiments of love, heroism, laughter, terror and wonder
are all fully shining in Her; therefore we are very much overpowered by
the halo emitted from Her; and we could not even see Her well.

 

Note :-- Rasas means sentiments. The rasas are usually eight. Sringâra,
Hâsya, Karu<u>n</u>â, Raudra, Vîra, Bhayânakâh, Bibhatsâdbhû tasangau,
Chetya<u>st</u>au, Natyan, Rasâh smritâh but sometimes Sântarasah, is
added thus making the total number nine; sometimes a tenth, Vâtsalyarasa
is also added.

 

55\. O King! In compliance with your order, we have come back to you no
sooner we had seen the Lady, without even addressing Her in any way. Now
order us what we are to do.”

 

56-58. Mahi<u>s</u>a said :-- “O Best of ministers! O Hero! Under my
command, go there with all the forces and use the means, conciliation,
etc., and bring that woman, having a beautiful face (like the Moon), to
me. If that Lady do not come even when the three policies, Sâma
(conciliation), Dâna (making gifts), and Bheda (sowing dissensions in an
enemy's party and thus winning him over to one's side, one of the four
Upâyas or means of success against an enemy) are adopted by you, then
apply the last resort Dan<u>d</u>a, (or war) in such a way that Her life
be not destroyed and bring that beautiful woman to me. I will gladly
make Her, of black curling hairs, my queen-consort. In case that
deer-eyed one comes gladly, then do my desires without causing any
unpleasant feeling; (a cessation of sentiment). I am enchanted on
hearing about Her beauties and wealth.”

 

59-67. Vyâsa said :-- The prime minister, on hearing the words of
Mahi<u>s</u>a, took with him elephants, horses, and chariots and
hurriedly went to the desired place. On coming near to the Devî, the
minister began to address Her in sweet words from a sufficient distance
in a very humble and courteous way. O Sweet speaking! Who art Thou? What
has caused Thee to come here? O Highly fortunate! My master has asked
through me these

 

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

 

questions. My master cannot be killed by all the Devas and men; he has
conquered all the Lokas (worlds). O Beautiful-eyed! On account of
getting his boon from Brahmâ, the Lord of the Daityas has become very
powerful and consequently being very proud, assumes different forms at
will. He, our King-Emperor Mahi<u>s</u>a, the lord of the earth, hearing
about Thy beauty and dress, has expressed a desire to see Thee. O
Beautiful one! Whether he will appear before Thee in a human form? He
will do whatever Thou likest. O Deer-eyed One! Be pleased now to go to
that intelligent King. In case Thou dost not go, we will bring the King,
Thy devotee, to Thee. O Lord of the Devas! Our King has heard of Thy
beauty and grandeur and has become very much submissive to Thee. We will
therefore do exactly what Thou desirest. Therefore, Thou having thighs
thick and round like those of a young of an elephant! Be pleased to
express what Thou likest and we will do quickly as Thou

desirest.

 

Here ends the Ninth Chapter of the Fifth Book on the worship offered by
the gods to the Devî and the weapons offered by them in the Mahâ
Purâ<u>n</u>am, S'rî Mad Devî Bhagâvatam, of 18,000 verses by
Mahar<u>s</u>i Veda Vyâsa.
