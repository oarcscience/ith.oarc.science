### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 17.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 9.

1\. May the mortal truly by sacrifices, O god, (magnify) the stronger
one for help; may the Pûru, when good service has been performed,
magnify Agni (and thereby draw him) hither for his aid.

2\. For thou art manifestly considered as his (i. e. Agni's) disposer,
highly brilliant by thyself [1](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:2:1.md): (magnify then
Agni who is) a firmament of bright splendour, lovely
beyond [2](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:2:2.md)
thought [3](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:2:3.md).

3\. (It is) yonder (sun?) who verily has been yoked by his (i. e.
Agni's) light [1](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:3:1.md) through the impetuous
speech [2](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:3:2)—(by the light of Agni.md) whose flames
mightily shine as if (they were made to shine) by the sperm of
heaven [3](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:3:3.md).

4\. Through his, the wise one's, insight there is wealth on his, the
wonderful (Agni's), chariot. And Agni is praised, he who is to be
invoked among all peoples.

5\. Now indeed our liberal lords have manifestly
attained [1](sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:5:1.md) treasure. Offspring of vigour!
Protect us for the sake of victory! Help us to welfare! And assist us to
grow strong in fights i

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—No verse occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:17:2:1">1</span>. I have translated the text in its
traditional form, which I think is correct. On the vocative vidharman,
comp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 106. One could think, however, of
reading vídharman as a locative, and sváya*s*astare, and of considering
mányase as a first person, like ar*k*ase, &c.: 'For in his extension,
brilliant by itself, I manifestly comprehend that firmament,' &c.

Note <span id="an_5:17:2:2">2</span>. Cf. VIII, 72, 3. antá*h*
i*kkh*anti tám *g*áne rudrám pará*h* manîsháyâ. 'Ueber alle Vorstellung
hinaus.' Ludwig.

Note <span id="an_5:17:2:3">3</span>. If we read sváya*s*astara*h*,
vídharman, and explain mányase as second person, the following
translation of this difficult verse may be attempted: 'Thou art
manifestly, indeed, considered as very brilliant by thyself in its (the
firmament's) extension: that firmament of bright splendour (I praise),
lovely beyond thought.' It is not very probable, however, that ásya
should refer to anything else but Agni.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:17:3:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a, whom Ludwig follows,
very probably is right in interpreting asáu as the sun.—On the Sandhi,
compare Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländ. Gesellschaft,
XLVIII, 679.

Note <span id="an_5:17:3:2">2</span>. Through the sacred spell, by which
the sun is made to rise through the kindling of the fire.—Cf. VIII, 17,
1, 5. tu*g*â´ … g*ri*bhâ´.

Note <span id="an_5:17:3:3">3</span>. Does this mean that Agni's flames
shine like lightning which receives its light from the waters of the
cloud, the sperm of heaven? Cf. IX, 74, 1, where it is said of the Soma
mixed with water: divá*h* rétasâ sa*k*ate.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:17:5:1">1</span>. I think that sa*k*anta should be
accented, because it is connected with hí.
