### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 13.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 13.

1\. To this god Agni I sing [1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:1:1.md) for you most
powerfully. May he come to us with the gods; may he, the best
sacrificer, sit down on the sacrificial grass.

2\. The righteous one to whose skill the two worlds (Heaven and Earth)
and (all) blessings cling—Him the men rich in offerings magnify, Him
those who long for gain, that they may obtain his blessing.

3\. He, the priest, is the guide of these
(men) [1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:3:1), and he indeed (is the guide.md) of
sacrifices. Praise ye this Agni who is the giver, the winner of wealth.

4\. May this Agni give us most blissful shelter for our (sacrificial)
feast, whence he may shower wealth on us in heaven, the (human)
dwellings [1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:4:1.md), and in the waters.

5\. The singers kindle Agni, the Hot*ri*, the lord of the tribes, the
brilliant, the wonderful, with his excellent
thoughts [1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:5:1.md).

6\. And mayst thou, the best invoker of the gods, help us in our spell,
in our hymns. Shine bliss on us, Agni whom the Maruts
strengthen [1](sbe46073.htm#an_3:13:6:1.md), the greatest winner of
thousandfold (wealth).

7\. Now bestow on us thousandfold wealth with offspring and prosperity,
splendid, most powerful, and undecaying abundance in heroes, O Agni!

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is *Ri*shabha Vai*s*vâmitra. The metre is
Anush*t*ubh.—Verses 6, 7 = MS. IV, 11, 2.—Comp. concerning this hymn,
Aitareya Brâhma*n*a II, 40.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:13:1:1">1</span>. Ar*k*a (ar*k*â) may be first or
second person. Comp., for instance, VI, 16, 22. prá va*h* sakhâya*h*
agnáye stómam … ár*k*a gâ´ya *k*a vedháse; X, 50, 1. prá va*h* mahé …
ár*k*a (Sa*m*hitâp. ár*k*â) vi*s*vâ´narâya vi*s*vabhúve, and see Benfey,
Die Quantitätsverschiedenheiten in den Sa*m*hitâ-und Pada-Texten der
Veden, III, p. 8.—On the metre of the second Pâda, comp. my Prolegomena,
p. 188.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:13:3:1">1</span>. Perhaps we should supply, on
account of the preceding nominative, vípra*h* ('priest'): of these
(priests).

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:13:4:1">1</span>. Kshitíbhya*h* seems to me to be
co-ordinated with diví and apsú â´; comp. X, 89, 11. The locative
kshitíshu would not have suited the metre as well as the dative. Prof.
Max Müller proposes to translate: 'Whence he may shower wealth on our
dwelling, whether he be in the sky or in the waters.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:13:5:1">1</span>. Comp. X, 172, 2. â´ yâhi vásvyâ
dhiyâ´.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:13:6:1">1</span>. Comp. *S*âṅkhâyana *S*rautasûtra
VIII, 16. indra*h* marutvân … marutstotra*h* marudga*n*a*h*
marudv*ri*dha*h* marutsakhâ.
