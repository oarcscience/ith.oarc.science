### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 127.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 12–13.

1\. I deem Agni to be the munificent Hot*ri*, the Vasu, the Son of
strength [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:1:1.md), *G*âtavedas, like a priest,
*G*âtavedas [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:1:2.md): the best performer of the
sacrifice, the god who with his upright body that is turned towards the
gods, and with his flame longs for the shine of the (boiling)
ghee [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:1:3.md), of the butter that is offered in
(the fire).

2\. May we, the sacrificers, call thee hither, the best of
sacrificers [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:2:1.md), the first of the Aṅgiras, O
priest, with our prayers, with priestly prayers, O bright
one [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:2:2.md): thee who like the heaven
encompassest the earth [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:2:3.md), the Hot*ri* of
human tribes, the manly flame-haired, whom these folks—whom all folks
should favour in order to speed him (to our sacrifice).

3\. He indeed, shining mightily with his shining
strength [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:1.md), becomes the conqueror of
deceitful foes [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:2.md)—like an axe, the conqueror
of deceitful foes [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:2.md). He at whose
onslaught [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:3.md) even what is strong melts
away [4](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:4), steady things (waste away.md) like
forests (which are burnt or bend down in the
storm) [5](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:5.md). Conquering he holds himself back;
he does not proceed [6](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:6.md). As with a conquering
bow-man he proceeds [6](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:6.md).

4\. Even what is firm gives way before him: thus it is known. With
hottest kindling-sticks [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:4:1.md) one worships
him [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:4:2.md) for winning his favour, one worships
Agni for winning his favour. He who dives into many forests as if
carving the wood with his flame, destroys even firm
food [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:4:3.md) with his strength—he destroys even
what is firm with his strength.

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

5\. Let us place that power [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:1.md) of his in our
neighbourhood [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:2)—(that power.md) which is more
visible by night than by day [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:3.md)—(more
visible) than by day to the unremitting [4](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:4.md)
(worshipper). Therefore his life is a firm
hold [5](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:5), like (a father's.md) safe refuge to a
son: (the fires) that never grow old, tending to blessings enjoyed or
not enjoyed (before) [6](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:6.md)—the fires that never
grow old, tending (to such blessings).

6\. He indeed makes a mighty noise like the host of the Maruts,
… [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:1.md) on the rich fields,
… [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:1.md) on the
… [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:1.md). He, the seizer, ate the
offerings [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:2.md), he who has deservedly become
the banner of the sacrifice. And when he joyously and joyfully
(proceeds), all followed gladly on his path; men (have followed) his
path as for a triumphal procession.

7\. When forsooth the Kîstas [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:7:1.md) striving for
heaven, when the Bh*ri*gus have addressed him paying reverence—the
Bh*ri*gus producing him by attrition, with worship: Agni is the lord of
goods, the bright one, who is their [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:7:2.md)
supporter. May the wise one accept the wonted
coverings [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:7:3.md); may the wise one accept them.

8\. We invoke thee, the lord of all people, the common master of the
house of all, to enjoy (the sacrifice): (we call) thee who truly art
carried by prayers as by a vehicle [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:8:1.md) to
enjoy (the sacrifice): the guest of men in whose presence (they live) as
before a father's (face), and all those immortals (attain) to strength,
and the offerings among the gods (attain) to strength.

9\. Thou, O Agni, art born, the mightiest by
might [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:9:1.md), for the divine world, the
strongest one, like wealth for the divine world. For thy delight is most
strong, and thy power is most brilliant. And

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

they walk around thee [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:9:2), O (god.md) who never
growest old, like obedient (servants), O (god) who never growest old.

10\. Let your praise go forth to the great Agni, who is mighty in his
might, who awakens at dawn, like a winner of
cattle [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:1.md)—let it go forth to Agni. When
(the worshipper) rich in offerings has loudly praised
him [2](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:2.md) in all
lands [3](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:3.md), he
wakes [4](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:4.md) like a singer in front of the
dawns [5](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:5), the flaming one (?.md), the Hot*ri*
(in front) of the dawns [5](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:10:5.md).

11\. Thus being seen by us, bring near to us, O Agni, graciously united
with the gods, benignantly, great wealth benignantly. Make us behold
great (bliss of valiant offspring [1](sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:11:1).md), O
mightiest one, that we may obtain such enjoyment. Produce great bliss of
valiant offspring, O bountiful Lord, (as fire is produced) by attrition,
for those who praise thee, like a strong hero in thy might.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Paru*kkh*epa Daivodâsi, the metre Atyash*t*i (verse 6
Atidh*ri*ti).—Verses 1–3 = SV. II, 1163–1165. Verse 1 = SV. I, 465; VS.
XV, 47; TS. IV, 4, 4, 8; MS. II, 13, 8; AV. XX, 67, 3.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:127:1:1">1</span>. There is no doubt that the
reading of the Rig-veda text vásum is correct; the Sâma-veda has
váso*h*. Comp. H. O., Prolegomena, p. 280.

Note <span id="an_1:127:1:2">2</span>. 'Is it a play on the word? Like a
priest knowing all things?' M. M.

Note <span id="an_1:127:1:3">3</span>. There is a metrical irregularity
in this Pâda; it has six syllables instead of five before the caesura.
The text, however, seems to be correct.

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:127:2:1">1</span>. The first Pâda is Trish*t*ubh
instead of *G*agatî. It would be easy to correct huvemahi, but that form
is never found in the Rig-veda, though both huvema and havâmahe are
frequent. Thus it is very probable that we have here a metrical
irregularity of the type described by H. O., Prolegomena, p. 117.

Note <span id="an_1:127:2:2">2</span>. Comp. VIII, 60, 3. víprebhi*h*
*s*ukra mánmabhi*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:127:2:3">3</span>. If the explanation of pári*g*man
which we have adopted (see above, I, 79, 3, note 2) is correct, it will
be impossible, of course, to accept Bergaigne's opinion (Rel. Véd., II,
505, note I) that the accusative dyâ´m is governed by pári*g*mânam.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:127:3:1">1</span>. In the second Pâda one syllable
is wanting. The text seems to be correct, and the irregularity
apparently is the typical one described by H. O., Prolegomena, p. 68
seq.: the Pâda has the tetrasyllabic beginning (before the caesura), and
it goes on as if the beginning had been pentasyllabic. Several Pâdas of
the same irregular structure occur in our hymn, thus in verse 9: tvám
(read tuám) agne \|\| sáhasâ sáhantama*h*; verse 10: prá va*h* mahé \|\|
sáhasâ sáhasvate; usha*h*-bûdhe \|\| pa*s*u-sé ná agnáye.

Note <span id="an_1:127:3:2">2</span>. The comparison para*s*ú*h* ná,
'like an axe,' raises doubts as to the correctness of druham-tará*h*.
Para*s*ú*h* seems to point to a compound containing the element drú,
'wood;' comp. below, 130, 4; VII, 104, 21. The second member of the
compound would be han, which is frequently used with the meaning of
cutting wood (II, 14, 2; X, 89, 7). Thus the reading would be
dru-hántara*h* (comp. v*ri*tra-hántama*h*), 'a mighty wood-cutter.' As
to this use of the comparative, see Delbrück. Altindische Syntax, p.
196.

Note <span id="an_1:127:3:3">3</span>. Comp. V, 7, 2. yásya sám*ri*tau.

Note <span id="an_1:127:3:4">4</span>. Prof. Max Müller (Science of
Thought, p. 325) . believes that the root *s*ru occurs here in the sense
of shaking. To me it seems that this *s*rúvat is a misspelling

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

for srúvat. The opinion of Pischel and Geldner (Vedische Studien, I, p.
vi) is different.

Note <span id="an_1:127:3:5">5</span>. The meaning of the comparison
which I have indicated by the words in parentheses, becomes clear from
VIII, 40, 1. vánâ-iva vâ´te ít.

Note <span id="an_1:127:3:6">6</span>. The two last Pâdas are very
obscure. In the last Pâda but one ná would seem to be comparative, not
negative, because it has the same meaning in the last Pâda, and because
its vowel does not coalesce with the following initial vowel (comp.
Benfey's dissertation, 'Behandlung des auslautenden a in ná "wie" and ná
"nicht."' But then instead of yamate a substantive meaning something
like 'hero' would be required. And also instead of the instrumental
dhanva-sáhâ one should expect to find a nominative; comp. Benfey, Vedica
and Linguistica, p. 180, note 1.—Prof. Max Müller translates: 'Holding
out (or resisting) he stands firm, he does not budge; holding his bow he
does not budge.'

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:127:4:1">1</span>. The words té*g*ish*th*âbhi*h*
ará*n*ibhi*h* are repeated, probably by the same poet, below, 129, 5.

Note <span id="an_1:127:4:2">2</span>. It may be observed that several
times in the Paru*kkh*epa hymns the parallelism between two subsequent
Pâdas has corrupted the text, the reading of the one Pâda being wrongly
introduced into the other. For instances I refer to I, 129, 11, where
the last vaso has been added from the preceding Pâda, and to the last
Pâda but one of I, 135, 4. Possibly our Pâda, which in its traditional
form is metrically abnormal (comp., however, M. M.’s Hymns to the
Maruts, 1st ed., p. cxii), has suffered damage in the same way. The
comparison of I, 129, 5 would lead us to conjecture: té*g*ish*th*âbhi*h*
ará*n*ibhi*h* ná ávase. 'One worships him in order that he may grant his
favour as if (he were to help us) with hottest kindling-sticks. One
worships Agni in order that he may grant his favour.'

Note <span id="an_1:127:4:3">3</span>. Comp. IV, 7, 10. sthirâ´ *k*it
ánnâ dayate ví *g*ámbhai*h*. The food is the wood which Agni consumes.

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:127:5:1">1</span>. See Prof. von Roth's translation
of this verse, Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 117. On
p*ri*kshám, comp. M. M., vol. xxxii, p. 302; Pischel, Vedische Studien,
I, p. 96 seq. The translation of such a word can only be tentative.

Note <span id="an_1:127:5:2">2</span>. To úparâsu something like vikshú
(IV, 37, 3) seems to be supplied.

Note <span id="an_1:127:5:3">3</span>. Comp. the Latin expression,
'argutius quam verius.' Pischel, Göttinger Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1884, p.
516 seq.; Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 196.

Note <span id="an_1:127:5:4">4</span>. Áprâyus seems to be an anomalous
formation, instead of áprâyu, unless we have to read áprâyuve. According
to Pischel (Göttinger Gel. Anzeigen, 1890, p. 542), áprâyushe would mean
'dem der da lebt.' But I do not think that this áprâyus should be
separated from áprâyu, which, as may be seen from I, 89, I compared with
III, 5, 6 and X, 4, 7, is identical in meaning with, and evidently
etymologically related to, áprayu*kkh*ant.

Note <span id="an_1:127:5:5">5</span>. Grábha*n*avat is the contrary of
agrabha*n*á, I, 116, 5.

Note <span id="an_1:127:5:6">6</span>. Comp. III, 30, 7. ábhaktam *k*it
bha*g*ate.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:127:6:1">1</span>. Ludwig: 'in den bebauten fluren
zu verehren, auf den wüsten flächen zu verehren.' Prof. Max Müller
observes with regard to ish*t*áni*h*: 'it stani*h*, or ish + stani*h*
(ish-kartâ), much thundering.' For â´rtanâ he proposes the translation,
'ploughed field.' I have left both words un-translated.

Note <span id="an_1:127:6:2">2</span>. Â´dat is imperfect of ad; there
is a play upon words (â´dat and â-dadí*h*).

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:127:7:1">1</span>. Who the Kîstas (cf. Lanman, p.
346) are is not known. They seem, however, either to be identical with
the Bh*ri*gus or to be another ancient and probably mythical family of
priests like them. They are mentioned also in VI, 67, 10.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

Note <span id="an_1:127:7:2">2</span>. 'Their' refers to 'goods.'

Note <span id="an_1:127:7:3">3</span>. The fuel and libations with which
Agni is covered?

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:127:8:1">1</span>. Vâ´has and its compounds, such as
stómavâhas, ukthávâhas, gírvâhas, have been treated of by Dr. Neisser in
his ingenious article on váhni, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XVIII, 301 seq.
(comp. on váhni, vol. xxxii, p. 37 seq.). Dr. Neisser tries to show that
by the side of váhni, derived from vah = Latin vehere, and meaning
'draught-horse' (and besides—though Dr. Neisser does not admit this, see
p. 316—'a person that drives in a chariot'), there existed a second
substantive váhni connected with the Greek εὔχεσθαι, and meaning both
'erhaben' and 'erhebend,' i. e. praising the gods (loc. cit., p. 314).
With this second váhni he connects vâ´has and its compounds. One of the
principal arguments of Dr. Neisser is the fact quite correctly stated by
him (p. 301), that 'the word váhni very frequently associates itself to
the term hót*ri*, while it does not with the compounds havyaváh and
havyavâ´hana.' This fact, indeed, points to the conclusion that 'those
compounds belong to another sphere of ideas than váhni' (p. 302). But
Dr. Neisser seems to me to go too far in concluding that váhni, standing
as an epithet of Agni, is not derived from vah = vehere. Agni's action
consists not only in carrying the sacrificial food to the gods, but also
in carrying the gods to the sacrifice of men, and in coming to that
sacrifice himself with his chariot and his horses. Nor do the words
stómavâhas or ukthávâhas, if derived from vah = vehere, necessarily
presuppose the admissibility of expressions such as 'uktham (stomam)
vahati vipra*h* devân a*kkh*a' (p. 303), but those compounds may also
rest on an idea conveyed by expressions such as 'uktham (stoma*h*)
vahati devân upa ya*gñ*am,' which idea is quite Vedic. Thus stómavâhas
in my opinion means, as an epithet of the god, 'carried by the stoma as
by a vehicle' (comp. VII, 24, 5. eshá stóma*h* mahé ugrâ´ya vâ´he
dhurí-iva átya*h* ná vâ*g*áyan adhâyi). or, as an epithet of the human
worshippers, fitting out the

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

stoma as a vehicle.' I believe that the words in question can thus be
explained in conformity with the whole range of Vedic thought, and the
artificial distinction of two different substantives váhni, &c., will be
avoided. For special indications pointing in the same direction, which
are furnished by the passages which contain the words here treated of, I
refer to Bergaigne, Religion Védique, II, 286 seq., and to the article
of Dr. Neisser himself, p. 321 seq.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:127:9:1">1</span>. On the metrical irregularity, see
above, verse 3, note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:127:9:2">2</span>. Te seems to stand for the
accusative, comp. Pischel, Zeitschrift der D. Morgenl. Gesellschaft,
XXXV, 714 seq.; Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, 205. Or may the meaning
be: and thy (worshippers) walk around thee … like obedient (servants)?'

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:127:10:1">1</span>. On the metre, see above, verse
3, note 1. Prof. Max Müller translates, 'like a hunter for cattle.'

Note <span id="an_1:127:10:2">2</span>. The phrase ví*s*vâsu kshâ´su
*g*óguve occurs also, V, 64, 2. The same hymn contains the word
su-*k*etúnâ, which is found in the eleventh verse of our hymn.

Note <span id="an_1:127:10:3">3</span>. Literally, 'on all earths.'
Comp. X, 2, 6. n*ri*vátî*h* ánu kshâ´*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:127:10:4">4</span>. *G*arate, 'he wakes,' at the
same time can mean 'he sings,' and 'he is praised.' Comp. Neisser,
Bezzenberger's Beiträge, X III, 298.

Note <span id="an_1:127:10:5">5</span>. The translation 'dawn' is
conjectural only. But it gives a good meaning in all the passages which
contain the word *ri*shû*n*â´m (besides our passage, V, 25, 1; VIII, 71,
15; X, 6, 1). Prof. Max Müller translates the last two Pâdas: 'he sings
like Rebha at the head of all singers, like a clever Hot*ri* among the
singers.'—Comp. Lanman, p. 424.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_1:127:11:1">1</span>. I supply suvî´ryam; see the last
Pâda but one.
