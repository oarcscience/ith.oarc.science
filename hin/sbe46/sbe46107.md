### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 3.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 16–17.

1\. Thou, O Agni, art Varu*n*a, when born; thou becomest Mitra when
kindled. In thee, O son of strength, the Vi*s*vedevâs (dwell). Thou art
Indra for the mortal worshipper.

2\. Thou becomest Aryaman when thou bearest [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:2:1.md)
the secret name of the maidens, O self-dependent one. They anoint (thee)
with cows [2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:2:2.md) like the well-established
Mitra [3](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:2:3.md), when thou makest husband and wife
one-minded.

3\. For thy glory the Maruts have cleansed
themselves [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:3:1.md), who are thy fair and brilliant
offspring, O Rudra [2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:3:2.md)! The footprint of
Vish*n*u which is put down in the highest place: therewith thou
protectest the secret name of the cows.

4\. By thy beauty, O god, the gods are beautiful to
behold [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:4:1). Assuming many (powers or goods.md)
they attached themselves to immortality. Men have set down Agni as the
Hot*ri*, the U*s*i*g*s, honouring (him), the praise of
Âyu [2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:4:2.md).

5\. There is no (other) Hot*ri* before thee, a better
sacrificer [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:5:1.md); no one surpasses thee, O
self-dependent one, by wisdom. And that house of which thou art the
guest, he [2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:5:2.md), O god, will overcome the mortals
by his sacrifice.

6\. May we overcome the mortals, O Agni, protected by thee, striving for
wealth, awaking (thee) with offerings; may we (overcome mortals) in the
contest, in the distribution [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:6:1.md) of days; may
we (overcome them) by wealth, O son of strength!

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

7\. If a man should turn upon us sin or guilt, bring ye the evil on him
who pronounces evil spells (against us). Destroy, O knowing one, such a
curse, O Agni, (of a man) who injures us by falsehood.

8\. Thee, O god, the ancient (mortals) have made their messenger at the
break of this (dawn), and have sacrificed with their oblations, when
thou goest along, O Agni, in the abode of wealth, a god kindled by the
mortals and by the Vasus.

9\. Protect the father—drive away (evil) as the knowing one—(the father)
who is considered [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:9:1.md) as thy son, O son of
strength [2](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:9:2). When, O sapient (Agni.md), wilt thou
look upon us? When wilt thou, who knowest *Ri*ta, requite (human deeds)?

10\. The father [1](sbe46107.htm#an_5:3:10:1.md) adoring gives many names
to thee, O Vasu, if thou shouldst take pleasure therein. Will not Agni,
delighting in his divine power, grant us his favour, he who has grown
strong?

11\. Thou indeed, O Agni, youngest one, bringest thy praiser across all
dangers. Thieves have been seen and deceitful men; dishonest people have
come with unknown designs.

12\. These our processions have been directed towards thee. Yes, to
thee, the Vasu, this guilt has been confessed. Verily this Agni, grown
strong, will never surrender us to the curse nor to him who does harm to
us.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Vasu*s*ruta Âtreya; the metre is Trish*t*ubh.—No verse of
this hymn occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:3:2:1">1</span>. I think that we must read
bíbharshi.

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

Note <span id="an_5:3:2:2">2</span>. I. e. with butter.

Note <span id="an_5:3:2:3">3</span>. On Mitra as the god of alliances,
and the anointing of Mitra—possibly of an object that represents
Mitra—see H. O., Religion des 2, p. 186, note 1. Cf. also Pischel,
Vedische Studien, I, 92 seq.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:3:3:1">1</span>. I. e. they have adorned themselves.
Cf. VII, 39, 3. urâ´v antárikshe mar*g*ayanta subhrâ´*h*.

Note <span id="an_5:3:3:2">2</span>. Rudra of course is here a name of
Agni.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:3:4:1">1</span>. Sud*rís*a*h*, which I have
translated as nom. plur., may also be understood as gen. sing.: 'by thy
beauty, who art beautiful to behold, O god, the gods, assuming, &c.'

Note <span id="an_5:3:4:2">2</span>. Cf. Narâ*s*a*m*sa.—This hemistich
is nearly identical with IV, 6, 11.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:3:5:1">1</span>. Comp. above, III, 17, 5.

Note <span id="an_5:3:5:2">2</span>. The construction is rather free.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_5:3:6:1">1</span>. Vidátheshu áhnâm: cf. above, I, 31,
6, note 2 ([p. 26](sbe46008.htm#page_26) seq..md).

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_5:3:9:1">1</span>. See Neisser, Bezzenberger's
Beiträge, XVIII, 310.

Note <span id="an_5:3:9:2">2</span>. Bergaigne (Religion Védique, II,
103) proposes to read yodhi without accent and to derive it, as Delbrück
does, from yu (not from yudh); he translates the first hemistich:
'Protège-nous, écarte le père qui passe pour ton fils.' I think that he
is right as to the verb yu, but that the accent of yódhi is correct; the
words yodhi vidvâ´n form a parenthesis. Agni is invoked to protect the
father of the sacrificing tribe (comp. verse to), or the father of

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni himself,
i. e. the sacrificer or the priest, who is himself considered, at the
same time, as the son of Agni (see Bergaigne, I, 37 seq.; Geldner,
Vedische Studien, I, 167).

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_5:3:10:1">1</span>. 'The father' may either be the
father spoken of in verse 9 (see verse 9, note 2). Or the word may refer
to Agni: 'He who adores thee, gives many names to thee, if thou, the
father, O Vasu, &c.'
