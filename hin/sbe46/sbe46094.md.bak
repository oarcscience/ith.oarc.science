### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 5.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 1–3.

1\. How may we unanimously offer mighty
light [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:1:1.md) to bountiful Agni Vai*s*vânara? With
his mighty perfect growth he supports the high
bank [2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:1:2.md) like a pillar.

2\. Do not reproach Him, the self-dependent one, who has given this
bounty to me, the god to the mortal, the clever one to the simple, the
wise immortal, the most manly, restless[1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:2:1.md) Agni
Vai*s*vânara.

3\. Agni, the sharp-pointed, the mighty bull with thousandfold sperm,
has proclaimed to me the great,
doubly-powerful [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:3:1.md) Sâman, the prayer, having
found, as it were, the hidden track of a
cow [2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:3:2.md).

4\. May Agni, he who is rich in wealth, whose teeth are sharp, consume
with his hottest flames those who violate the laws founded by Varu*n*a,
the beloved, firm (laws) of attentive Mitra.

5 [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:5:1.md). They who roam about like brotherless
girls [2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:5:2.md), of evil conduct like women who
deceive their husbands, being wicked, sinful, and untrue—they have
created for themselves this deep place [3](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:5:3.md).

6\. On me, however small, but innocent, thou, O purifying Agni, hast
fiercely placed this mighty, deep, vigorous prayer, like a heavy burden,
this P*ri*sh*th*a [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:6:1.md), consisting of seven
elements [2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:6:2.md).

7\. Let our prayer which purifies Him, through the power of mind
(inherent in it), reach Him who is the common (property of all men)
alike, the good (name?) of P*ris*ni on the skin of the herbs, on the
summit of the … [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:7:1.md).

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

8\. What should be openly uttered by me of this speech? They secretly
speak of that which is hidden [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:8:1.md). When they
have uncovered, as it were, the water of the
cows [2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:8:2.md), he guards the beloved summit of the
… [3](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:8:3.md), the footstep of the
bird [4](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:8:4.md).

9\. He has found in secret that great face of the great ones which the
bright cow accompanied [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:9:1), the ancient (face.md)
shining in the abode of *Ri*ta, the quickly running, quickly moving.

10\. And resplendent near his parents (Heaven and Earth), in their
presence, he thought of the secret, good (name?) of P*ris*ni. The tongue
of the manly, forward-bent flame (seized) that which was near at hand in
the highest abode of the mother, the cow [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:10:1.md).

11\. I speak, when being asked, *Ri*ta (i. e. truth), out of reverence
(for Agni, or for the gods), out of hope [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:11:1.md)
placed in thee, O *G*âtavedas, as I am
here [2](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:11:2.md). Thou rulest over all this wealth
whatever (dwells) in heaven and earth.

12\. Which of this wealth is ours, what treasure? Mayst thou who knowest
it declare to us (that treasure), O *G*âtavedas! What is the highest
(aim) of this our way, is hidden. We have not come scolding to an empty
(?) [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:12:1.md) place.

13 [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:13:1.md). What is the limit, what the objects?
What pleasant (wealth) may we obtain as swift (horses gain) the prize?
When will the Dawns, the divine consorts of the immortal, expand over us
with the sun's splendour?

14\. And what do those insatiable ones here say, O Agni, with their
sapless, feeble, weak speech that has to be listened to? Let them
unarmed fall into nothingness.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

15\. The face of this kindled, manly Vasu has shone gloriously in the
house. Clothed in brilliancy, with his shape beautiful to behold, the
bountiful has shone like a house [1](sbe46094.htm#an_4:5:15:1.md) with its
wealth.

#### NOTES.

The hymn is addressed to Vai*s*vânara. The same *Ri*shi and metre.—No
verse occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_4:5:1:1">1</span>. Cf. especially I, 45, 8 (above, [p.
42](sbe46011.htm#page_42).md). b*ri*hát bhâ´*h* bíbhrata*h* haví*h*.

Note <span id="an_4:5:1:2">2</span>. Cf. vol. xxxii, p. 93 (I, 38, 11,
note 2).

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_4:5:2:1">1</span>. See above, I, 36, 1, note 2.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_4:5:3:1">1</span>. Dvibárhâ*h* is neuter. See Lanman,
p. 560; Joh. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen der Indogermanischen Neutra, p.
132.

Note <span id="an_4:5:3:2">2</span>. Agni has discovered the Sâman which
he proclaims to the mortal, like the track of a lost cow.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_4:5:5:1">1</span>. See H. O., Religion des Veda, p.
539.

Note <span id="an_4:5:5:2">2</span>. Abhrâtára*h* cannot be accusative
plural fem., as Zimmer (Altindisches Leben, p. 419) seems to take it.
The correct interpretation has been given by Pischel, Vedische Studien,
I, p. 299.

Note <span id="an_4:5:5:3">3</span>. I. e. hell.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_4:5:6:1">1</span>. In the younger Vedic ritual certain
Stotras are technically designated as p*ri*sh*th*a or 'backs' of the
liturgies

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (see, for
instance, Weber, Indische Studien, X, 385). Does the word stand here in
the same sense? Or should we correct présh*th*am?

Note <span id="an_4:5:6:2">2</span>. The seven tones of the scale?

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_4:5:7:1">1</span>. This passage is obscure. The text
runs thus: sasásya *k*árman ádhi *k*â´ru p*rí*sne*h* ágre rupá*h*
árupitam (â´rupitam Sa*m*hitâpâ*th*a) *g*ábâru. As to the first words,
see III, 5, 6. To *k*â´ru possibly a noun like nâ´ma should be supplied
(cf. below, verse 10). The last Pâda (cf. above, III, 5, 5, note 1) is
simply untranslateable.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_4:5:8:1">1</span>. Of the milk alluded to in the third
Pâda?—On ni*n*ík, cf. Lanman, p. 436; Job. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen der
Indogerm. Neutra, p, 397.

Note <span id="an_4:5:8:2">2</span>. The water of the cows is the milk,
cf. X, 12, 3. Roth (Zeitschr. der D. Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLVIII,
682): als sie den Schatz der Kühe entdeckt hatten (vâr iva = vâram iva).

Note <span id="an_4:5:8:3">3</span>. Rupá*h* ágram.

Note <span id="an_4:5:8:4">4</span>. Comp above, III, 5, 5 with note 1;
III, 5, 6, note 2.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_4:5:9:1">1</span>. The sun, the face of the great gods
(cf. I, 115, 1), accompanied by the dawn?

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_4:5:10:1">1</span>. Is the meaning of all this that
Agni, shining on the altar between heaven and earth, desires, and
consumes with his flames, the oblation of butter which has its home in
the udder of the cow?

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_4:5:11:1">1</span>. On â*s*ásâ, see Lanman, p. 492
seq.; Bartholomae Indogermanische Forschungen, I, 182 seq.; Bechtel,
Hauptprobleme

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

der Indogerm. Lautlehre, p. 262. This noun is not to be derived from the
root *s*âs, but from *s*a*m*s.

Note <span id="an_4:5:11:2">2</span>. Compare I, 79, 2 (with note 3).

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_4:5:12:1">1</span>. Comp. X, 108, 7, where the Pa*n*is
say to Saramâ: réku padám álakam â´ *g*agantha ('the place is empty (?);
thou hast come in vain').

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_4:5:13:1">1</span>. This verse has been treated of by
Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 306.

##### Verse 15.

Note <span id="an_4:5:15:1">1</span>. On this comparison, see Hirzel,
Gleichnisse und Metaphern im Rigveda, p. 102 seq.
