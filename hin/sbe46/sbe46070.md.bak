### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 10.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 7–8.

1 [1](sbe46070.htm#an_3:10:1:1.md). Thee, O Agni, the highest king of human
tribes, the god, thoughtful mortals kindle at their worship.

2\. Thee, O Agni, the *Ri*tvig, the Hot*ri*, they magnify at the
sacrifices. Shine as the guardian of *Ri*ta in thy own
house [1](sbe46070.htm#an_3:10:2:1.md).

3\. He indeed who may worship thee, the *G*âtavedas, with fuel, acquires
abundance in valiant men, O Agni; he will prosper.

4\. May He, the banner of the sacrifices, Agni, come hither with the
gods, anointed by the seven Hot*ri*s [1](sbe46070.htm#an_3:10:4:1.md) for
the sake of the man who offers sacrificial food.

5\. Bring ye forward an ancient, mighty speech to Agni, the Hot*ri*, who
is like a worshipper bearing the lights of
prayers [1](sbe46070.htm#an_3:10:5:1.md).

6\. May our prayers increase Agni, since he is born deserving of
praises, the conspicuous one, for the sake of great strength and wealth.

7 [1](sbe46070.htm#an_3:10:7:1.md). May Agni, as the best sacrificer at the
worship (of men), perform the sacrifice to the gods for the man devoted
to the gods. As a joyous Hot*ri* thou reignest (passing) beyond (all)
failures.

8\. Thus, O purifier, shine on us glorious abundance in heroes. Be the
nearest (friend) to those who praise thee, for their welfare.

9\. Thus the priests full of admiring praise, having awoke, kindle thee,
the immortal carrier of sacrificial food, the increaser of strength.
