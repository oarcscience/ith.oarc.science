### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 23.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 15.

1\. Agni, bring hither, through the power of thy splendour, powerful
wealth which may manifestly prevail over all tribes in the (contests
for) booty.

2\. O powerful Agni! Bring hither that wealth powerful in battles. For
thou art the true, wonderful giver of booty rich in cows.

3\. For all men who have spread out the sacrificial grass, unanimously
ask thee, the beloved Hot*ri* in the seats (of sacrifice), for many
boons.

4\. For he who dwells among all tribes, has invested himself with power
against assault [1](sbe46127.htm#an_5:23:4:1.md). Agni! In these
dwelling-places shine to us richly, O bright one, shine brilliantly, O
purifier!

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Dyumna Vi*s*va*k*arsha*n*i Âtreya (cf. verse 1); the
metre is the same.—Verses 1–2 = TS. I, 3, 14, 6–7.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:23:4:1">1</span>. Is abhímâti (abhímâtî?) a dative?
Should we read abhimâti-sahá*h* (cf. X, 83, 4) as a compound: 'he has
been established as the conqueror of assaults.'
