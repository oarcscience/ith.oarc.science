### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 4.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 23–25.

1\. Produce thy stream of flames like a broad onslaught. Go forth
impetuous like a king with his elephant [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:1:1.md); …
 [2](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:1:2.md) after thy greedy onslaught, thou art an
archer; shoot the sorcerers with thy hottest (arrows).

2\. Thy whirls fly quickly. Fiercely flaming touch (them). O Agni, (send
forth) with the ladle [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:2:1.md) thy heat, thy winged
(flames); send forth unfettered thy firebrands all around.

3\. Being the quickest, send forth thy spies against (all evildoers). Be
an undeceivable guardian of this clan. He who attacks us with evil
spells, far or near, may no such (foe) defy thy track.

4\. Rise up, O Agni! Spread out against (all foes)! Burn down the foes,
O (god) with the sharp weapon! When kindled, O Agni, burn down like dry
brushwood, the man who exercises malice against us.

5\. Stand upright, strike (the foes) away from us! Make manifest thy
divine (powers), O Agni! Unbend the strong (bows) of those who incite
demons (against us) [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:5:1.md). Crush all enemies, be
they relations or strangers.

6\. He knows thy favour, O youngest one, who makes a way for a sacred
speech like this. Mayst thou beam forth to his doors all auspicious days
and the wealth and the splendour of the niggard.

7\. Let him, O Agni, be fortunate and blessed with good rain, who longs
to gladden thee with

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

constant offerings and hymns through his life in his house. May such
longing ever bring auspicious days to him.

8\. I praise thy favour; it resounded here. May this song (which is
like) a favourite wife, awaken for thee [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:8:1.md).
Let us brighten thee, being rich in horses and chariots. Mayst thou
maintain our knightly power day by day.

9\. May (the worshipper) here frequently of his own accord approach
thee, O (god) who shinest in darkness [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:9:1.md),
resplendent day by day. Let us worship thee sporting and joyous,
surpassing the splendour of (other) people.

10\. Whoever, rich in horses and rich in gold, approaches thee, O Agni,
with his chariot full of wealth—thou art the protector and the friend of
him who always delights in showing thee hospitality.

11\. Through my kinship (with thee) I break down the great (foes) by my
words [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:11:1). That (kinship.md) has come down to me
from my father Gotama. Be thou attentive to this our word, O youngest,
highly wise Hot*ri*, as the friend of our house.

12\. May those guardians of thine, infallible Agni, sitting down
together protect us, the never sleeping, onward-pressing, kind,
unwearied ones, who keep off the wolf, who never tire.

13 [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:13:1.md). Thy guardians, O Agni, who seeing have
saved the blind son of Mamatâ from distress—He the possessor of all
wealth has saved them who have done good deeds. The impostors, though
trying to deceive, could not deceive.

14\. In thy companionship we dwell, protected by thee. Under thy
guidance let us acquire gain. Accomplish both
praises [1](sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:14:1), O (thou who art the.md)

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

truth! Do so by thy present power, O fearless one!

15\. May we worship thee, O Agni, with this log of wood. Accept the hymn
of praise which we recite. Burn down those who curse us, the sorcerers.
Protect us, O (god) who art great like Mitra, from guile, from
revilement, and from disgrace.

#### NOTES.

The hymn is addressed to Agni Rakshohan. The same *Ri*shi and
metre.—Verses 1–15 = TS. I, 2, 14, 1–6; MS. IV, 11, 5. Verses 1–5 = VS.
XIII, 9–13; MS. II, 7, 15.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_4:4:1:1">1</span>. On íbhena, cf. Pischel-Geldner,
Vedische Studien, I, p. xv.

Note <span id="an_4:4:1:2">2</span>. The meaning of drû*n*âná*h*, which
evidently should be pronounced dru*n*âná*h* (H. O., Prolegomena, p.
478), is uncertain. This verb is stated to occur still in one other
passage, Maitr. Sa*m*h. II, 4, 2. tad ya eva*m* vidvânt surâm pibati na
haina*m* drû*n*âti (dru*n*âti, two MSS.). But should we not read there
hru*n*âti? \[And possibly in our passage, as Prof. Max Müller observes,
hrû*n*âná*h*?\]

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_4:4:2:1">1</span>. On *g*uhṽâ, see Pischel, Vedische
Studien, II, 113. Wherever butter is poured out with the ladle, the
flames arise.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_4:4:5:1">1</span>. The third Pâda is identical with X,
116, 5 b.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_4:4:8:1">1</span>. Or 'resound to thee' (sám
*g*areta). Cf. above, 3, 15. Shall we read, in consideration of this
parallel

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

passage, sám devávâtâ *g*aratâm iyám gî´h ('may this song beloved by the
gods resound' or 'awaken')?

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_4:4:9:1">1</span>. On dóshâvasta*h*, see above, I, 1,
7, note 1.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_4:4:11:1">1</span>. I have taken maná*h* as acc.
plural. If it is gen. singular, the translation will be: 'Through my
kinship with the great (Agni) I break down (my foes) by my words.'

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_4:4:13:1">1</span>. This verse is identical with I,
147, 3. See the notes there. The original place of this verse seems to
be in the first Ma*nd*ala, because it mentions Mâmateya.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_4:4:14:1">1</span>. Probably the praise or song of the
gods and of men. See vol. xxxii, p. 439.
