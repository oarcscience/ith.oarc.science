### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 6.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 4–5.

1\. Stand upright for us, O Agni, Hot*ri* of the sacrifice, the best
performer of sacrifices among the gods. For thou art the master of every
thought; thou promotest the worshipper's prayer.

2\. The unerring Hot*ri* has sat down among the people, joy-giving Agni,
the wise one at the sacrifices [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:2:1.md). Like
Savit*ri* he has sent his light upward. Like a builder he has reared his
smoke up to the sky.

3 [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:3:1). (The ladle.md) glowing, filled with gifts,
with butter, is stretched forth. From left to right (does Agni move)
choosing the divine people. Upright (stands) the (sacrificial) post like
a new-born foal [2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:3:2.md); well-placed,
well-established it anoints the victims [3](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:3:3.md).

4\. After the sacrificial grass has been spread and the fire kindled,
the delighted Adhvaryu has stationed himself upright. Agni, the Hot*ri*,
chosen from of old, goes round thrice, like a shepherd.

5\. As Hot*ri*, measuredly running, Agni, the joy-giving, sweet-tongued,
the righteous, goes around by his own might. His flames run forward like
race-horses; all beings are afraid when he has shone forth.

6\. Beautiful, O fair-faced Agni, is thy aspect, who art terrible and
manifold; pleasant (it is). As they have not hindered thy light by
darkness, no bespatterers have left stains on thy body.

7\. He whose mother (?) [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:7:1.md) has not been
hindered from giving birth, nor his father and mother whenever

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

they were incited (?) [2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:7:2.md): this Agni, the
purifier, well-established like Mitra [3](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:7:3.md), has
shone among the tribes of men,—

8\. Agni, whom the twice-five sisters [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:8:1.md),
dwelling together, have engendered among the human tribes, who awakes at
dawn, who is bright like an elephant's (?) [2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:8:2.md)
tooth, whose mouth is beautiful, who is sharp like an axe.

9 [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:9:1.md). Agni, those golden horses of thine
swimming in ghee, the red ones which go straight forward, the fleet
ones, the brilliant, manly, wonderful horses, puissant stallions, have
called hither the divine people.

10\. Those victorious, never-tiring [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:10:1.md),
fierce flames of thine, O Agni, which move about,
hasten [2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:10:2.md) to their goal like hawks; they roar
mightily like the host of the Maruts.

11 [1](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:11:1). (This.md) hymn has been produced for
thee, O Agni, when thou wert kindled. May (the priest) recite the
litany; mayst thou distribute (treasures) to him who sacrifices. Men
have set down Agni as the Hot*ri*, the U*s*i*g*s, adoring (Him), the
praise of Âyu [2](sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:11:2.md).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 6 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 1.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_4:6:2:1">1</span>. The text has vidátheshu. Cf. above,
I, 31, 6 note.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_4:6:3:1">1</span>. With the first hemistich compare
above, III, 19, 2. See also VI, 63, 4.

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

Note <span id="an_4:6:3:2">2</span>. On akrá, see Geldner, Vedische
Studien, I, 168.

Note <span id="an_4:6:3:3">3</span>. The meaning seems to be that the
sacrificial post, which has been anointed itself, imparts ointment to
the victim tied to it.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_4:6:7:1">1</span>. The meaning of sâ´tu is uncertain.
Boehtlingk-Roth give 'receptaculum.' Joh. Schmidt (Kuhn's Zeitschrift,
XXV, p. 29, cf. Hübschmann, Indogerm. Vocalsystem, p. 75) translates
'Mutterleib,' and connects the word with strî´. If 'womb' is right, it
seems to be the womb from which Agni was born.

Note <span id="an_4:6:7:2">2</span>. Does this ish*t*áu belong to ish,
'to incite,' or to ish, 'to wish'? 'Whenever he (Agni) wishes.' M. M.

Note <span id="an_4:6:7:3">3</span>. On the well-established Mitra,
comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 186, note 1.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_4:6:8:1">1</span>. The ten sisters of course are the
fingers.

Note <span id="an_4:6:8:2">2</span>. In translating atharỹa*h* ná dántam
I have followed the opinion of Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 99) on the
meaning of atharî´ though his theory is very doubtful.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_4:6:9:1">1</span>. With this description of Agni's
horses, comp. above, IV, 2, 2. 3.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_4:6:10:1">1</span>. On ayâ´sa*h*, cf. above, III, 18,
2, note 1.

Note <span id="an_4:6:10:2">2</span>. See Geldner, Kuhn's Zeitschrift,
XXVII, 234.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_4:6:11:1">1</span>. The second hemistich of this verse
is nearly identical with V, 3, 4.

Note <span id="an_4:6:11:2">2</span>. Cf. nárâ*s*a*m*sa, vol. xxxii, p.
439.
