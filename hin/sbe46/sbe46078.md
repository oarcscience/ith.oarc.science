### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 18.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 18.

1\. Be kind, O Agni, when we approach thee, as a friend a friend, as
parents [1](sbe46078.htm#an_3:18:1:1.md), a straight leader. For full of
deceit are the tribes of men: burn thou against (all) malign powers so
that they turn back.

2\. Burn, O Agni, the nearer enemies, burn the curse of the distant
evil-doer. Burn, O Vasu, seeing the unseen ones. May thy never-ageing,
never-tiring flames [1](sbe46078.htm#an_3:18:2:1.md) spread out.

3\. Wishing for (thy blessings), O Agni, by fuel and ghee I offer this
sacrificial food for (the attainment of) advancing power and of
strength; worshipping thee with my spell as far as I have power (I
offer) this divine prayer for the attainment of hundred(fold blessings).

4\. (Shining) forth with thy flame, O son of strength, praised (by us),
bestow mighty vigour on those who toil for thee, bright luck and
welfare, O Agni, on the Vi*s*vâmitras! We have cleaned thy body many
times.

5\. Give us treasures, O best gainer of riches: such indeed art thou,
Agni, when thou hast been kindled. In the blessed praiser's house thou
hast placed, together with wealth, thy mighty(?)
arms [1](sbe46078.htm#an_3:18:5:1.md), thy marvellous shapes.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 2 = TÂ. IV, 5, 5. Verse 3 = AV. III,
15, 3.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:18:1:1">1</span>. It is rather strange that Agni is
compared with the two parents. Generally it is the two A*s*vins, or
Heaven and Earth, or the pair of Indra and Varu*n*a, &c.. who are
compared with father and mother (see Hirzel, Gleichnisse und Metaphern
im Rigveda, 71 seq.). No doubt in our verse the dual was chosen on
account of the metre.—I do not think that Bollensen (Orient und
Occident, II, 473) and Kirste (Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XVI, 297) are
right in believing that a dative of pit*ri* is found here, and in
translating: 'as a good (son) to his father.'

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:18:2:1">1</span>. The meaning of ayâ´sa*h* is
doubtful; comp. Brugmann in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIV, 24 seq.; M. M.,
vol. xxxii, p. 371 (VI, 66, 5); von Bradke, Festgruss an Roth, 124.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:18:5:1">1</span>. On s*ri*prá, see I, 96, 3, note 3.
Karásna must mean something like 'arm,' though the exact meaning is
doubtful. In VIII, 32, 10 the compound s*ri*prákarasna occurs. Prof. Max
Müller writes: 'Thou hast brightly assumed a body with soft arms or with
stretched-out arms, if we do not read s*ri*prakarasnâ.'
