### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 19.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 11.

1\. They are born for retirement [1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:1:1.md). Out of
the cover he [2](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:1:2.md) has shone forth, being a
cover himself. In the lap of the mother he looks
about [3](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:1:3.md).

2\. Causing him to discern (the pious and the impious?), they have
sacrificed. With unwinking eyes they protect his manly power. They have
penetrated into the firm stronghold [1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:2:1.md).

3\. The people of *S*vaitreya [1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:3:1.md), his clans,
have thriven brilliantly. B*ri*haduktha with a golden ornament at his
neck, is eager for the race as if by this
honey-drink [2](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:3:2.md).

4\. Like the dear milk of love [1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:4:1)—(a thing.md)
unrelated with two (things) related [2](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:4:2.md)—like
the gharma vessel with booty in its belly—undeceived, the deceiver of
all [3](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:4:3.md).

5\. Sporting, O beam of light, appear to us, joined with the ash, with
the wind. May those well sharpened … of his, standing on …, be sharp
like… [1](sbe46123.htm#an_5:19:5:1.md).

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Vavri Âtreya (cf. verse 1. prá vavré*h* vavrí*h*
*k*iketa). The metre is Gâyatrî in verses 1, 2, Anush*t*ubh in verses 3,
4, Virâ*d*rûpâ in verse 5.—No verse occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

This Sûkta seems to be anything rather than an ordinary Agni hymn. It
may be a collection of verses belonging to an Âkhyâna, or of verses
serving another purpose which we can scarcely hope to discover. In
several parts of this

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sûkta I must
content myself with translating the words without being able to
elucidate the poet's meaning.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:19:1:1">1</span>. I translate the noun avasthâ´ in
accordance with the Vedic meaning of the verb ava-sthâ. Possibly it
means the secret parts, cf. avastha, AV. VII, 90, 3 (B.-R.). Ludwig
translates: 'Ein zustand erzeugt einen andern,' and paraphrases, 'Nur
zustände und formen, gestalten lernen wir kennen, das wesen des gottes
bleibt uns verborgen.' This seems too modern. Prof. Max Müller proposes:
'The remnants (afterbirth) have been brought forth. Skin has shone forth
from skin.'—On the question who are the beings 'born for retirement,' I
do not venture any conjecture.

Note <span id="an_5:19:1:2">2</span>. Is Agni meant?

Note <span id="an_5:19:1:3">3</span>. Cf. X, 5, 1. (Agní*h*) asmát
hridá*h* bhû´ri*g*anmâ ví *k*ash*t*e.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:19:2:1">1</span>. The meaning seems to be that the
worshippers (possibly the first worshippers, the Aṅgiras), by
discovering Agni and by worshipping him, have conquered the hostile
strongholds.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:19:3:1">1</span>. *S*vaitreya is mentioned as a
victorious hero also in I, 33, 14.

Note <span id="an_5:19:3:2">2</span>. Does this phrase allude to the
rite of offering, at the Vâ*g*apeya sacrifice, to the horses that were
going to run the sacred race, a naivâra *k*aru? In the Mantras connected
with this rite the words occur: 'Drink of this honey-drink' (asyá
mádhva*h* pibata). See Rig-veda VII, 38, 8; Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ I, 7,
8, 2; Weber, Ueber den Vâ*g*apeya, p. 30.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:19:4:1">1</span>. The retas?

Note <span id="an_5:19:4:2">2</span>. Does this refer to an offering or
the like, composed of two substances related among each other (such as

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

milk and butter), and a third substance unrelated (such as rice)? Of
course all this is absolutely uncertain.

Note <span id="an_5:19:4:3">3</span>. Is this Agni?

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:19:5:1">1</span>. The meaning of dh*ri*shá*g*,
vakshî´, vaksha*n*esthâ´ is unknown.—On the first hemistich of this
verse, compare Pischel Vedische Studien, II, 54.
