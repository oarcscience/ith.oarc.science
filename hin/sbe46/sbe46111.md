### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 7.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 24–25.

1\. O friends, (bring) together your united food and praise to Agni, the
strongest (god) of (human) dwellings, the offspring of Vigour, the
mighty one—

2\. At whose onslaught [1](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:2:1), wherever it be, men
rejoice in the seat of men, whom the worthy ones kindle, whom (human)
creatures produce.

3\. When we get together the food and the offerings of men, he has
grasped, with the strength of his splendour, the rein of *Ri*ta.

4\. He indeed produces light even by night to him who is afar, when he,
the ever-young purifier, destroys the lords of the forest.

5\. He at whose officiating (men) pour down the offering of their sweat
on the paths—to Him who is noble by his own nature, the worlds have
risen as to ridges (of hills)—

6\. He whom the mortal has acquired, the much-desired (god), for the
refreshment of every one, the sweetener of nourishment, the homestead
for the Âyu—

7\. He indeed, the beast, mows off deserts and habitable land like a
mower, the golden-bearded with brilliant teeth, the *Ri*bhu of
undecaying strength.

8\. The bright one for whom (the gh*ri*ta) streams (quickly) like an
axe [1](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:8:1), as at (the sacrifice of) Atri. Him the
well-bearing mother has born, as soon as [2](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:8:2)
she had enjoyed love [3](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:8:3).

9\. He who satisfies thee for refreshment, O Agni

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

who drinkest butter: mayst thou bestow splendour, renown, and (wise)
mind on such mortals [1](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:9:1).

10\. Thus I have seized upon the spirit of Adhri*g*(?) as upon a head of
cattle given by thee [1](sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:10:1). May then Atri, O
Agni, overcome the Dasyus who do not give (to the Brahmans); may Isha
overcome the men (who do not give).

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Isha Âtreya (cf. verse 10); the metre is Anush*t*ubh
(verse 10, Paṅkti).—Verse 1 = VS. XV, 29; TS. II, 6, 11, 4; IV, 4, 4, 3;
MS. IV, 11, 1. Verses 2, 3 = TS. II, 1, 11, 3; MS. IV, 12, 4.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:7:2:1">1</span>. Yásya sám-*ri*tau: see I, 127, 3.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_5:7:8:1">1</span>. With the expression svádhiti*h*-iva
rî´yate (Lanman, Noun-Inflection, p. 375), compare V, 48, 4. rî*t*ím
para*s*ó*h*-iva. Of course we must ask: what is the thing that streams
so brightly and quickly as an axe moves? The thing in question is stated
to stream (rîyate) for Agni now as it did at Atri's sacrifice. The
expression 'as at Atri's sacrifice' seems to show that something like
prayers or libations is alluded to. The verb rîyate, on the other hand,
seems to point either to rivers, or to streams of Soma or of Gh*ri*ta.
Thus, considering that Gh*ri*ta is mentioned much more frequently in
connection with Agni than Soma, we are led to the conclusion that the
poet speaks here of streams of Gh*ri*ta. Should we not for *s*ú*k*i*h*
read *s*ú*k*i, which would be here as in IV, 1, 6; VI, 10, 2; IX, 67,
12, an epithet of Gh*ri*ta? 'He for whom the bright (Gh*ri*ta) streams
quickly like an axe.' The origin of the reading

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

sú*k*i*h* may easily be accounted for; the word was thought to refer to
Agni.—Another interpretation of this hemistich has been given by Benfey,
Vedica and Linguistica, p. 177.

Note <span id="an_5:7:8:2">2</span>. Krâ*n*â´: cf. I, 58, 3, note 1 ([p.
47](sbe46012.htm#page_47)).

Note <span id="an_5:7:8:3">3</span>. 'Sobald sie den Liebesgenuss
erlangt hatte.' Pischel, Ved. Studien, 1, 71.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_5:7:9:1">1</span>. The first hemistich speaks of the
worshipper in the singular, the second in the plural.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_5:7:10:1">1</span>. This hemistich is quite obscure.
With manyúm â´ dade, cf., for instance, X, 48, 2. dá*s*yubhya*h* pári
n*ri*m*n*ám â´ dade. Adhrí*g*a*h* may be the genitive of a proper name,
as I have translated it; but this is quite doubtful. Was the hymn
intended for a charm in which the sacrificer seized a head of cattle
which represented the spirit of an enemy, and thus deprived that enemy
of his courage?
