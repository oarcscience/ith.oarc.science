### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 7.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 6–7.

1\. This (Agni) has been established here as the first by the
establishers, the Hot*ri*, the best sacrificer who should be magnified
at the sacrifices, whom Apnavâna and the Bh*ri*gus have made shine,
brilliant in the woods, spreading to every house.

2\. Agni! When will the splendour of thee, the god, appear in the right
way? For verily the mortals have seized thee who shouldst be magnified
in the houses.

3\. Seeing the righteous, wise one, like the heaven with the stars, who
produces joy at all sacrifices, from house to house—

4\. The quick messenger of Vivasvat who rules over all human tribes: Him
the Âyus have brought hither to every house, the light, him who belongs
to the Bh*ri*gus.

5\. Him the knowing one they have set down in the right way as the
Hot*ri*, the gay one with his purifying flames, the best sacrificer with
his seven (forms [1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:5:1))—

6\. Him who is enveloped in many mothers, in the
wood [1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:6:1), who does not rest thereon
(?) [2](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:6:2), who is brilliant, though hidden in
secret, easily to be found, and striving for all that is desired.

7\. When the gods rejoiced in the … of the
herbs [1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:7:1), in that
udder [2](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:7:2), in the foundation of
*Ri*ta [3](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:7:3), the great -Agni, to whom offerings
are made with adoration, the righteous one, always approached eagerly
for the sake of sacrifice.

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

8 [1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:8:1). Thou, the knowing one, hast eagerly
performed the messengership of the sacrifice, looking over both ends,
over the two worlds. Thou goest as a messenger, chosen from of old, thou
who knowest best the ascents to heaven.

9\. Thy path is black. Light is before thee, the red one. Thy flame is
speedy. This is one of the wonders: when the virgin conceives (thee as
her) child [1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:9:1), thou becomest a messenger, as
soon as thou art born.

10\. As soon as he is born, his strength shows itself, when the wind
blows upon his flame. He turns his sharp tongue among the dry brushwood.
Even solid food he tears to pieces with his teeth.

11\. When he thirstily has grown strong by thirsty
food [1](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:11:1), restless Agni appoints a thirsty
messenger. Consuming (the wood) he follows the
… [2](sbe46096.htm#an_4:7:11:2) of the wind. He seems to drive forward a
quick horse; the racer speeds along.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is *G*agatî in verse 1, Anush*t*ubh in
verses 2–6, Trish*t*ubh in verses 7–11.—Verse 1 = VS. III, 15; XV, 26;
XXXIII, 6; TS. I, 5, 5, 1; MS. I, 5, 1.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_4:7:5:1">1</span>. The seven flames or tongues of
Agni? The seven Hot*ri*s? The seven Ratnas?

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_4:7:6:1">1</span>. Cf. IX, 107, 18. pári góbhi*h*
úttara*h* sî´dan váneshu avyata.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

Note <span id="an_4:7:6:2">2</span>. Possibly we might conjecture
â´*s*ritam, 'who rests thereon.'

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_4:7:7:1">1</span>. On sasásya, cf. above, III, 5, 6,
note 2. Víyutâ seems to be a locative standing parallel with the
locative û´dhan. We have here sasásya víyutâ … *ri*tásya dhâ´man, quite
as in V, 21, 4 the two accusatives *ri*tásya yónim and sasásya yónim
stand parallel. The meaning of víyutâ, however, seems to me quite
uncertain. Is it an action-noun derived from vi-yu, 'to separate,' 'to
keep off,' or from (vi-) vâ, 'to weave'? Professor Max Müller proposes:
'at the removal of the grass or tinder in which the spark is kept. '

Note <span id="an_4:7:7:2">2</span>. sásmin û´dhan; cf. below, 10, 8.

Note <span id="an_4:7:7:3">3</span>. Cf. above, I, 147, 1.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_4:7:8:1">1</span>. With this verse, compare below,
hymn 8, verse 4.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_4:7:9:1">1</span>. The wood, the child of which is
Agni.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_4:7:11:1">1</span>. I take ánnâ here as an
instrumental.—Compare with our passage VII, 3, 4. t*ri*shú yát ánnâ
samáv*ri*kta *g*ámbhai*h*; X, 79, 5. yá*h* asmai ánnam t*ri*shú
âdádhâti; X, 91, 7. t*ri*shú yát ánnâ vévishat vitísh*th*ase; X, 113, 8.
agní*h* ni gámbhai*h* t*ri*shú ánnam ávayat.

Note <span id="an_4:7:11:2">2</span>. me*l*ím; cf. above, III, 26, 9.
