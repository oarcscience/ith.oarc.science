the quick chariot [1](sbe46071.htm#an_3:11:5:1.md), ever new.

Agni, is most mightily renowned.

gods) towards the delights (of sacrifice), "the worshipping mortal
attains the dwelling-place [2](sbe46071.htm#an_3:11:7:2) of (Agni.md) whose
flames are purifying.

8\. May we, the priests, by our prayers obtain all the blissful gifts of
Agni *G*âtavedas.
