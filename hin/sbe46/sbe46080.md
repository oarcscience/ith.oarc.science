### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 20.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 20.

1\. The carrier (of the gods) [1](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:1:1) calls by his
hymns Agni, Ushas (dawn), the two A*s*vins,
Dadhikrâ [2](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:1:2) at daybreak. May the gods rich in
light, unanimously longing for our sacrifice, hear us.

2\. Agni, threefold is thy strength; three are thy abodes; three are thy
many tongues, O thou who art born in *Ri*ta! And three, O Agni, are thy
bodies beloved by the gods. With these protect our prayers
unremittingly.

3 [1](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:3:1). Agni! Many are the names, O
*G*âtavedas, of thee the immortal one, O self-dependent god! And
whatever the secret powers of the powerful [2](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:3:2)
are, thou all-enlivener, in thee they have placed together (those) many
(powers), O (god) after whose relations men
ask [3](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:3:3).

4\. Agni is the divine leader of the divine tribes like Bhaga, the
guardian of the seasons [1](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:4:1), the righteous.
May He, the killer of V*ri*tra [2](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:4:2), the
ancient one, the possessor of all wealth, bring the singer across all
troubles.

5\. I invite hither [1](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:5:1)
Dadhikrâ [2](sbe46080.htm#an_3:20:5:2), Agni, and the goddess Ushas,
B*ri*haspati and the god Savit*ri*, the A*s*vins, Mitra and Varu*n*a and
Bhaga, the Vasus, Rudras, and Âdityas.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 2 = TS. II, 4, 11, 2; III, 2, 11, 1;
MS. II, 4, 4. Verse 3 = TS. III, 1, 11, 6.

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:20:1:1">1</span>. The 'carrier' of the gods is the
Hot*ri*. See above, I, 127, 8, note 1, and compare the article of Dr.
Neisser quoted there. See also M. M., vol. xxxii, pp. 40–43 (I, 6, 5).

Note <span id="an_3:20:1:2">2</span>. On Dadhikrâ or Dadhikrâvan, the
deified horse of Trasadasyu, see Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 124;
Ludwig, vol. iv, p. 79; H. O., Religion des Veda, 71. Prof. Max Müller
writes, 'It seems to me some form of Agni generally in company with
matutinal gods.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:20:3:1">1</span>. The reader who compares this
passage with 19, 4, will observe a general resemblance pointing to the
conclusion that both verses belong to the same author.

Note <span id="an_3:20:3:2">2</span>. Mâyâ´*h* mâ´yínâm: comp.
concerning the idea of mâyâ´, H. O., Religion des Veda, 163, 294.

Note <span id="an_3:20:3:3">3</span>. With p*ri*sh*t*abandhu, comp.
bandhup*ríkh*, bandhveshá.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:20:4:1">1</span>. Perhaps *ri*tu-pâ´*h* should be
changed into *ri*ta-pâ´*h* 'the god who protects the *Ri*ta, the
righteous.'

Note <span id="an_3:20:4:2">2</span>. Or 'the killer of foes.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:20:5:1">1</span>. Possibly we have to read, on
account of the metre, ihá hve.

Note <span id="an_3:20:5:2">2</span>. See above, verse I, note 1.
