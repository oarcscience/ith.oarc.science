### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 144.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 13.

1\. The Hot*ri* [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:1:1.md) goes
forward [2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:1:2) (in order to fulfil.md) his duty by
his wonderful power, directing upwards the brightly adorned prayer. He
steps towards the (sacrificial) ladles which are turned to the
right [3](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:1:3.md) and which first kiss his
foundation [4](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:1:4.md).

2\. They have greeted with shouts the streams of
*Ri*ta [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:2:1.md) which were hidden at the
birthplace of the god, at his seat. When He dwelt dispersed in the lap
of the waters, he drank the draughts by (the power of) which he
moves [2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:2:2.md).

3\. Two (beings) of the same age [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:3:1.md) try to
draw that wonderful shape (Agni) towards themselves, progressing in
turns towards a common aim [2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:3:2.md). Then he is to
be proclaimed by us like a winner [3](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:3:3.md) (in a
contest). The charioteer [4](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:3:4.md) (governs all
things) as if pulling in the reins of a draught-horse.

4\. He whom two (beings) of the same age [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:4:1.md)
serve, two twins dwelling together in one common abode, the gray one has
been born as a youth by night as by day [2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:4:2.md),
the ageless one who wanders through many generations of men.

5\. The prayers, the ten fingers [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:5:1.md) stir him
up. We, the mortals, call him, the god, for his protection. From the dry
land he hastens to the declivities [2](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:5:2.md). With
those who approached him he has established new
rules [3](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:5:3.md).

6\. Thou indeed, O Agni, reignest by thy own nature over the heavenly
and over the terrestrial

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

world as a shepherd (takes care of his cattle). These two variegated,
great (goddesses) striving for gloriousness, the golden ones who move
crookedly [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:6:1.md), have approached thy
sacrificial grass.

7\. Agni! Be gratified and accept graciously this prayer, O joy-giver,
independent one, who art born in the *Ri*ta, good-willed one, whose face
is turned towards us from all sides, conspicuous one, gay in thy aspect,
like a dwelling-place rich in food [1](sbe46042.htm#an_1:144:7:1.md).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, *G*agatî.—No verse occurs in the other
Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:144:1:1">1</span>. The Hot*ri* is Agni.

Note <span id="an_1:144:1:2">2</span>. Comp. III, 27, 7, where it is
said of Agni: purástât eti mâyáyâ.—The poet says éti prá, and not prá
eti, in order to avoid the hiatus.

Note <span id="an_1:144:1:3">3</span>. Comp. below, III, 6, 1.
dakshi*n*â-vâ´*t*.

Note <span id="an_1:144:1:4">4</span>. 'Which first, i. e. at the time
when the sacrificial vessels are put down, kiss his dhâman (foundation),
i. e. the place of Agni.' Sâya*n*a.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:144:2:1">1</span>. Comp. IX, 75, 3. abhí îm
*ri*tásya dohánâ*h* anûshata, and VIII, 12, 32. nâ´bhâ ya*gñ*ásya dohánâ
prá adhvaré. I take dohánâ*h* as acc. plur. of an abstract noun dohánâ
formed like *g*ará*n*â, bhandánâ, &c. But possibly it might be the nom.
plur. either of the same noun or of a nomen agentis dohána: 'the streams
of *Ri*ta (the libations?) or the milkers of *Ri*ta, hidden at the
birthplace of the god, have greeted him with shouts.' It would

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

be difficult, however, to say why the milkers of *Ri*ta (i. e. the
priests?) are called 'hidden at the birthplace of the god.' Prof. Max
Müller thinks of a reading parîv*rí*ta*h*, 'surrounding Agni.' He refers
the 'streams of *Ri*ta' (nom.) to the water, cf. I, 105, 12. *ri*tám
arshanti síndhava*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:144:2:2">2</span>. Svadhâ´*h* adhayat yâ´bhi*h*
î´yate. In my opinion svadhâ´ means 'the inherent power,' 'the power of
moving according to one's own will,' and then the drink which confers
this power on a being, especially on the dead ancestors.—Comp. M. M.,
vol. xxxii, p. 32 seq.; H. O., Religion des Veda, 531, note 2.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:144:3:1">1</span>. According to Sâya*n*a the two
beings spoken of here and in the next verse are the Hot*ri* and the
Adhvaryu.

Note <span id="an_1:144:3:2">2</span>. See I, 130, 5. ayu*ñg*ata samânám
ártham ákshitam; III, 6i, 3. samânám ártham *k*ara*n*îyámânâ.

Note <span id="an_1:144:3:3">3</span>. On bhága*h* ni hávya*h*, see
Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 121.

Note <span id="an_1:144:3:4">4</span>. The charioteer is Agni.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:144:4:1">1</span>. See verse 3, note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:144:4:2">2</span>. Comp. Gaedicke, Der Accusativ, p.
175. He translates: 'bei Tage noch bei Nacht ergrauend.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:144:5:1">1</span>. Vrí*s* (ἅπαξ λεγόμενον) is ranged
in the Nigha*nt*us among the aṅgulinâmâni and explained by Sâya*n*a
accordingly. The word seems indeed to mean 'finger.' Compare with our
passage IX, 8, 4; 15, 8; 93, 1; 97, 57.

Note <span id="an_1:144:5:2">2</span>. Comp. I, 33, 4. dháno*h* ádhi
vishu*n*ák té vi âyan, and especially X, 4, 3. dháno*h* ádhi pravátâ
yâsi háryan. I cannot follow Pischel (Vedische Studien, II, 69 seq.) in
explaining these passages. 'Over the heavenly expanse he hastens down
towards us.' M. M.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

Note <span id="an_1:144:5:3">3</span>. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, I,
300. Like Pischel I do not know who 'they who approached Agni' are.
Possibly the worshippers or priests are alluded to. 'He received new
praises with (or from) those who approached him.' M. M.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:144:6:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a explains the two female
beings here in question as Heaven and Earth. Does the 'crooked movement'
refer to the daily revolution of the sky?

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:144:7:1">1</span>. The last Pâda recurs X, 64, 11.
