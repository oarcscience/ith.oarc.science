### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 12.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 11–12.

#### TO INDRA-AGNÎ.

1\. Indra-Agni, in consequence of our prayers come hither to the pressed
(Soma), to the precious cloud [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:1:1.md). Drink of it
incited by our thoughts (i. e. by our prayers).

2\. Indra-Agni, the brilliant [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:2:1.md) sacrifice of
him who praises you goes forward together (with the Soma libations, the
praises, &c.). Thus drink this pressed (Soma)!

3\. By this stirring sacrifice I choose Indra and Agni who show
themselves as sages [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:3:1.md); may they here satiate
themselves with Soma.

4\. I call the bounteous [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:4:1.md), the killers of
foes [2](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:4:2.md), the united conquerors, unconquered,
Indra-Agni, the greatest winners of booty.

5\. The praisers rich in hymns, knowing all the ways (of the sacrifice),
laud you. Indra-Agni, I choose the food (which you give).

6\. Indra-Agni, you have hurled down by one deed the ninety strongholds
together of which the Dâsas were the lords.

7\. Indra-Agni, the thoughts (of the worshippers) go forward towards
(you) from the work (of sacrifice) along the paths of *Ri*ta.

8\. Indra and Agni, yours are powerful abodes and delights. You cross
the waters: this is the deed which belongs to
you [1](sbe46072.htm#an_3:12:8:1.md).

9\. Indra and Agni, you display the lights of heaven in your deeds of
strength; that mighty deed of yours has been known far and wide.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre. The hymn is addressed to the couple Indra
and Agni.—Verses 1–3 = SV. II, 19–21. Verse 1 = VS. VII, 31; TS. I, 4,
15, 1; MS. I, 3, 17. Verses 4–6 = SV. II, 1052–1054. Verses 5–8 = SV.
II, 925–928. Verse 5 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 6 = TS. I, 1, 14, 1; MS. IV,
10, 5. Verses 9, 7, 8 = SV. II, 1044–1045. Verse 9 = TS. IV, 2, 11, 1;
3, 13, 8; TB. III, 5, 7, 3; MS. IV, 10, 4; 11, 1.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:12:1:1">1</span>. 'Cloud,' of course, means that
which comes from the cloud. In the Soma hymns of the ninth Ma*nd*ala,
the word nábha*h* seems frequently to refer to the water with which the
Soma is mixed (see IX, 69, 5; 71, 1. 3; 74, 4; 83, 5; 86, 14; 97, 21;
Prof. Hillebrandt's opinion on these passages is different, see his
Vedische Mythologie, I, 212). Perhaps we should go too far in believing
that in our verse the poet invited the gods to come and drink that
water, but possibly the mixture of water and of the juice of the Soma
plant descending from heaven and nourished by the heavenly waters
represented itself to the poet's mind as something coming from, and thus
being identical with, the cloud.

##### Verse 2

Note <span id="an_3:12:2:1">1</span>. On *k*étana*h*, Prof. Max Müller
remarks, 'perhaps which appeals to you … so that they take note of it.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:12:3:1">1</span>. There may be doubts about
kavi*kkh*ádâ. Prof. Max Müller remarks, 'is it, wishing for sages?' I
think that my translation is recommended by X, 81, 1. prathama*kkh*át.

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:12:4:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 169, 5. râ´ya*h*
to*s*átamâ*h*; VIII, 38, 2. to*s*â´sâ rathayâ´vânâ … índrâgnî, and
Brugmann in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIV, 24.

Note <span id="an_3:12:4:2">2</span>. Or, the killers of V*ri*tra.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_3:12:8:1">1</span>. On aptúr and aptû´rya, comp.
Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 122 seq., and H. O., Göttingische Gelehrte
Anzeigen, 1889, 4 seq.
