### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 59.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 25.

1\. The other Agnis (the other fires) are verily thy branches, O Agni.
In thee all the immortals enjoy
themselves [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:1:1.md). Vai*s*vânara! Thou art the
centre [2](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:1:2.md) of human settlements; like a
supporting column thou holdest men [3](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:1:3.md).

2\. The head of heaven, the navel of the earth is Agni; he has become
the steward [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:2:1.md) of both worlds. Thee, a god,
the gods have engendered, O Vai*s*vânara, to be a light for the Ârya.

3\. As in the sun the rays are firmly fixed, thus in Agni Vai*s*vânara
all treasures have been laid down [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:3:1.md). (The
treasures) which dwell in the mountains, in the herbs, the waters, and
among men—of all that thou art the king.

4\. As the two great worlds to their son [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:4:1.md),
like a Hot*ri*, like a skilful man, (we bring) praises—manifold
(praises) to him who is united with the sun, to the truly strong one,
new (praises) to Vai*s*vânara, the manliest god.

5\. Thy greatness, O *G*âtavedas, Vai*s*vânara, has exceeded even the
great heaven. Thou art the king of the human tribes; thou hast by
fighting gained wide space for the gods.

6\. Let me now proclaim the greatness of the bull whom the Pûrus worship
as the destroyer of enemies [1](sbe46013.htm#an_1:59:6:1.md). Agni
Vai*s*vânara, having slain the Dasyu, shook the (aerial) arena and cut
down *S*ambara.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

7\. Agni Vai*s*vânara, extending by his greatness over all dominions,
who is to be worshipped, the bright one, rich in loveliness, is awake
(or, is praised) among the Bharadvâ*g*as, in the homestead of
Puru*n*îtha *S*âtavaneya, with his hundredfold blessings.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi as in I, 58. Metre, Trish*t*ubh. None of the verses of
this hymn occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:59:1:1">1</span>. Comp. VII, 11, 1. ná *ri*té tvát
am*rí*tâ*h* mâdayante, 'the immortals do not enjoy themselves without
thee.'

Note <span id="an_1:59:1:2">2</span>. Literally, 'the navel.' Comp.
Muir, V, 214.

Note <span id="an_1:59:1:3">3</span>. Comp. IV, 5, 1 (see below). úpa
stabhâyat upamít ná ródha*h*.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:59:2:1">1</span>. Comp. the remark on I, 58, 7 (note
1).

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:59:3:1">1</span>. I cannot follow Prof. von Roth
(Zeitschrift der D. Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 116), who explains
dadhire as a third person sing. of dh*ri*.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:59:4:1">1</span>. The incompleteness both of the
construction and of the metre shows that the text of the first Pâda is
corrupt. I doubt whether it ever will be possible to restore the correct
reading with full certainty, but I shall be glad if others succeed
better than I did—and I may add, better than Prof. von Roth (Zeitschrift
der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 117 seq.) seems to me to have
succeeded—in correcting and in interpreting the text. I think that after
sûnáve

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

ródasî clearly one syllable is wanted to complete the Pâda: possibly we
should read therefore sûnáve ródasyo*h* (comp. verse 2, Pâda 2, aratí*h*
ródasyo*h*, which words form the end of the Pâda). Agni, as is well
known, is the son of the two worlds, the sûnú*h* ródasyo*h*. In the
beginning of the Pâda b*ri*hatî´ must either refer to the two worlds: in
this case we have to read b*ri*hatyó*h* (instead of b*ri*hatî´ iva); or
b*ri*hatî´ may refer, as this adjective frequently does, to the gíra*h*,
and we shall possibly have to read b*ri*hatî´*h* va*h* (as to va*h*,
comp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, 206). But of course all these are
mere guesses. In every case the verb on which the accusative gíra*h*
depends ('we bring,' or something like that) must be supplied.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:59:6:1">1</span>. Or, as the killer of V*ri*tra. See
H. O., Religion des Veda, 135, note 2.
