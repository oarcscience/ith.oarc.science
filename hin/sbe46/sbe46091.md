### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 2.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 16–19.

1\. He who has been established as the steward among the mortals, the
immortal, righteous one, and among the gods, being a god himself, the
Hot*ri*, the best sacrificer shall mightily
flame [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:1:1.md); Agni shall rise
up [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:1:1.md) with the offerings of Manus.

2\. Here, O Agni, son of strength, thou goest for us to-day as a
messenger, thou who art born, between the two races (of men and gods),
having harnessed, O tall one, thy puissant, manly, brilliant
(stallions) [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:2:1.md).

3\. Harnessing the two mighty, red steeds that swim in ghee—(the steeds)
of *Ri*ta, I think, that are most swift with their
mind [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:3:1.md), the ruddy ones, thou goest (as a
messenger) between you, the gods, and the tribes of
men [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:3:2.md).

4\. O Agni, with thy good horses, and thy good chariot, rich in
bounties, bring hither from among them (the
gods) [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:4:1.md) Aryaman, Varu*n*a, and Mitra, Indra
and Vish*n*u, the Maruts and the A*s*vins, to him who offers good
oblations.

5\. This sacrifice, O Agni, is rich in
cows [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:5:1.md), in sheep and horses, in manly
friends; it is never to be despised; it is rich in nourishment, O
wonderful lord [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:5:2.md), rich in offspring; it is
long-lasting wealth, broad-based, with (brilliant) assemblies.

6 [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:6:1.md). Be a self-strong protector, O Agni, of
the man who in the sweat of his brow brings fuel to
thee [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:6:2.md), or heats his head desirous to worship
thee. Deliver him from every harmful man.

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

7\. The man who brings food to thee who art desirous of food, he who
stirs up [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:7:1.md) the cheerful guest and rouses him,
the godly man who kindles thee in his dwelling: to him may belong
lasting and generous wealth.

8\. The sacrificer who praises thee in the evening and in the morning
and gratifies thee; that liberal man thou shouldst bring across all
distress, like a well-impelled horse [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:8:1.md),
(dwelling) in his house.

9\. The man who worships thee, the immortal one, O Agni, and who honours
thee, holding the sacrificial ladle—may he, the toiling (sacrificer),
not be deprived of wealth; may no distress that comes from a harmful
(foe), surround him.

10\. That mortal whose well-ordered sacrifice thou, as the god,
acceptest, O Agni, as a liberal giver, may his
worship [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:10:1.md) be welcome, O youngest god, (the
Hot*ri*'s work performed) for a worshipper whose helpers we may be.

11\. May he, the knowing one, distinguish wisdom and folly of
mortals [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:11:1.md), like straight and crooked backs
(of horses) [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:11:2.md). And for the sake of wealth
and noble offspring, O god, grant us Diti and keep off
Aditi [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:11:3.md).

12\. The undeceived sages instructed the sage (Agni), setting him down
in the dwellings of Âyu [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:12:1.md). Hence mayst thou
behold, O Agni, with thy eyes [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:12:2.md) these beings
visible and secret (that move) on the Arya's
ways [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:12:3.md).

13\. Bring thou, O Agni, youngest (god), who art a good guide, a
plentiful, brilliant treasure to the worshipper who presses Soma, who
serves thee and toils, to help him, O brisk one, who fillest the
dwellings of peoples.

14 [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:14:1.md). And whatsoever we have done, O Agni,
out

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

of devotion for thee, with our feet [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:14:2.md), with
our hands, with our bodies: (in those deeds of ours) the wise have held
up the *Ri*ta, aspiring after it, like those who manage a chariot by
means of the two pole-arms (?) [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:14:3.md).

15\. And may we be born from the Dawn, the mother, as the seven
priests [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:15:1.md), as the first worshippers among
men [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:15:2.md). May we be the Aṅgiras, the sons of
Heaven. May we flaming break the rock which contains the prize of the
contest [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:15:3.md).

16\. And as our first, ancient fathers, O Agni, were aspiring after
*Ri*ta [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:16:1.md)—they attained to pure
devotion [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:16:2.md), chanting their litanies.
Cleaving the earth they disclosed the red (cows).

17\. The pious men, well performing the acts (of worship), resplendent,
melting [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:17:1.md) the generations of the
gods [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:17:2.md) like
ore [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:17:3.md), kindling Agni, strengthening Indra,
went along [4](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:17:4.md), besieging the stall of cows.

18\. He looked (on the gods) as on herds of
cattle [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:1.md) in a rich
(pasture) [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:2.md), when the generations of the
gods (were) near him, O mighty one [3](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:3.md). After
(the generations) of the mortals the
Urva*s*îs [4](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:4.md) have pined, for the growing
strong of the Arya [5](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:5.md), of the nearer
Âyu [6](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:18:6.md).

19\. We have done our work for thee; we have been good workers—the
brilliant dawns have shone out
*Ri*ta [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:19:1),—brightening [2](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:19:2.md)
the perfect Agni who manifoldly shines with fine splendour,
(brightening) the god's beautiful eye.

20\. We have recited these hymns for thee, the sage, O Agni, worshipper
(of the gods) [1](sbe46091.htm#an_4:2:20:1.md); accept them! Blaze up; make
us wealthier. Bestow great wealth on us, O bountiful one!

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Vâmadeva, the metre Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 5 = TS. I, 6, 6,
4; III, 1, 11, 1; MS. I, 4, 3. Verse 6 = TÂ. VI, 2, 1. Verse 11 = TS. V,
5, 4, 4. Verse 16 = VS. XIX, 69; TS. II, 6, 12, 4. Verses 16–19 = AV.
XVIII, 3, 21–24.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_4:2:1:1">1</span>. On this use of these infinitives,
comp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 412.—Mánusha*h* seems to be
genitive; comp. II, 2, 6. havyâ´ mánusha*h*; II, 2, 8. hótrâbhi*h* …
mánusha*h*; I, 76, 5. mánusha*h* havírbhi*h*.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_4:2:2:1">1</span>. Comp. below, IV, 6, 9.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_4:2:3:1">1</span>. As to the horses of *Ri*ta, comp.
above, III, 6, 6. In spite of the different accent there is no doubt
that gh*ri*tasnúvâ, which occurs in that verse, is the same word as
gh*ri*tásnû, in our verse, a compound of gh*ri*ta with a noun snu which
seems to be different from sâ´nu, and connected with the root snâ (cf.
gh*ri*tasnâ´, IV, 6, 9; and see Bechtel, Hauptprobleme der Indogerm.
Lautlehre, p. 211). V*ri*dhasnú, on the other hand, seems to be no
compound, but an adjective formed like vadhasnu, nishatsnú. It is
evident, however, that the poet here employed the two words v*ri*dhasnú
and gh*ri*tásnu as parallel expressions.

Note <span id="an_4:2:3:2">2</span>. Read mártâm (for mártân; gen.
plur.). Comp. below, verse 11; VI, 47, 16. ví*s*a*h* manushy̆ân, where we
ought to read manushỹâm. See Lanman, p. 353; Pischel, Vedische Studien,
I, p. 44; Bartholomae, Studien zur Indogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I,
p. 48.

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_4:2:4:1">1</span>. 'Could it be Mitrám eshám, the
rapid Mitra?' M. M.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_4:2:5:1">1</span>. The meaning is, it is rich in
reward consisting in cows, &c.

Note <span id="an_4:2:5:2">2</span>. The text has asura. Cf. H. O.,
Religion des Veda, p. 164.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_4:2:6:1">1</span>. With the first Pâda, comp. below,
12, 2.

Note <span id="an_4:2:6:2">2</span>. On svátavân, see Benfey, Vedica and
Linguistica, p. 1 seqq.; Lanman, p. 559; Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's
Zeitschrift, XXVI, p. 357 seq.; H. O., Prolegomena, p. 471.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_4:2:7:1">1</span>. Ni*s*íshat is not derived, as is
the case for instance with â´ *s*ishâmahi, VIII, 24, 1, from (ni-)*s*âs
(Grassmann, Ludwig), but from ni-*s*â (Böhtlingk-Roth); comp. VII, 3, 5.
ni*s*í*s*ânâ*h* átithim. We must read, consequently, ni*s*í*s*at, formed
like dádhat (3rd sg. subj. pres., or possibly nom. sing. part. pres.).

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_4:2:8:1">1</span>. Böhtlingk-Roth conjecture
harmyâ´vân 'im Hause, im Stall gehalten.' It is true that beasts may be
kept in the harmya; comp. VII, 56, 16; X, 106, 5; Zimmer, Altindisches
Leben, p. 149. But I do not think that 'being kept in the harmya' could
be expressed by harmya-vat. Hemyâ´vat seems to be derived from the root
hi, and to have the same meaning as â*s*uhéman; such a word very well
fits into a phrase referring to a swift horse. Hemyâ´vat stands to hemán
in the same relation as omyâ´vat to omán. All this was pointed out first
by Ludwig (vol. iv, p. 22).

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_4:2:10:1">1</span>. Literally the Hot*ri*’s work
(performed for such a Ya*g*amâna).

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_4:2:11:1">1</span>. I read mártâm (gen. plur.); comp.
above, verse 3, note 2. It is possible, however, to leave the text
unchanged; in this case the translation would be: 'May he, the knowing
one, distinguish wisdom and folly, the (wise and foolish) mortals like
straight and crooked backs (of horses).'

Note <span id="an_4:2:11:2">2</span>. Comp. vîtáp*ri*sh*th*a,
'straight-backed,' a frequent epithet of horses.

Note <span id="an_4:2:11:3">3</span>. For Prof. Max Müller's
interpretation of this passage, comp. vol. xxxii, p. 256. See also
Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, III, 97; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 297 seq.
It is very strange that the poet should ask the god to keep off Aditi
(comp. I, 152, 6. áditim urushyet) who must here be considered,
consequently, as a malevolent deity. I think that this conception of
Aditi is derived from the idea of this goddess as punishing sin; it is
the same goddess who may free the sinner from the bonds of sin and who
may fetter and destroy him. Keeping off Aditi seems to mean,
consequently, removing from the mortal the danger of being bound by the
fetters of sin; the idea is the same as above in IV, 1, 5, where Agni is
invoked to make Varu*n*a, the son of Aditi, go away (comp. H. O.,
Religion des Veda, p. 336, note 1). In that case granting Diti would
mean granting freedom from those same fetters. (On Diti, who very
appropriately has been called a mere reflex of Aditi, see M. M., loc.
cit.; Bergaigne, III, 97 seq.)

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_4:2:12:1">1</span>. On Âyu, the mythical ancestor of
the human race, see Bergaigne, Religion Védique, I, p. 59 seq.

Note <span id="an_4:2:12:2">2</span>. On pa*d*bhí*h*, comp. Pischel,
Ved. Studien, I, 228 seq.; Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 3
seq.; Bloomfield, Contributions to the Interpretation of the Veda,
Second Series, p. 32 seq. (American Journal of Philology, XI, 350 seq.).
I believe that in our verse pa*d*bhí*h* should be derived from a noun
pá*s*, and translated, 'with thy eyes,'

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

while in verse 14 we ought to read padbhí*h*, and to translate, 'with
the feet.'

Note <span id="an_4:2:12:3">3</span>. Pischel (Ved. Studien, I, 229,
note I) believes that aryá*h* is nom. sing., referring to Agni. But
compare VI, 51, 2. ri*g*ú márteshu v*rig*inâ´ *k*a pá*s*yan abhí
*k*ash*t*e sû´ra*h* aryá*h* évân. This verse makes it very probable that
aryá*h* is a genitive dependent on évai*h*, évân ('beholding right and
wrong deeds among the mortals, the Sun looks upon the Arya's ways'). On
the stem arí, 'the Arya,' see Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen
Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, XL, p. 125.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_4:2:14:1">1</span>. This verse has been commented upon
by Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 229 seq.

Note <span id="an_4:2:14:2">2</span>. On pa*d*bhí*h* or rather
padbhí*h*, comp. verse 12, note 2.

Note <span id="an_4:2:14:3">3</span>. In translating bhurí*g* I have
followed, though not without doubt, the theory of Pischel, Ved. Studien,
I, 239 seq.—Pischel seems to be right in making ritám depend both on
yemu*h* (comp. IV, 23, 10) and on â*s*ushânâ´*h* (comp. above, IV, 1,
13, and below, verse 16).

##### Verse 15.

Note <span id="an_4:2:15:1">1</span>. The seven *Ri*shis or Aṅgiras, the
sons of Heaven and the Dawn (cf. above 1, 16).

Note <span id="an_4:2:15:2">2</span>. n*rî´*n (or rather n*rî´*m) is
genitive plural. See Lanman, p. 430; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, p.
42.

Note <span id="an_4:2:15:3">3</span>. Here we have again the seven
*Ri*shis breaking the mountain in which the cows were imprisoned.

##### Verse 16.

Note <span id="an_4:2:16:1">1</span>. The apodosis is wanting. As verse
15 shows, the meaning is: As our fathers have done their mighty deeds,
aspiring after *Ri*ta, thus may we do the same.

Note <span id="an_4:2:16:2">2</span>. *S*ú*k*î´t (Padap. *s*ú*k*i ít)
possibly stands for *s*úkim ít; cf. Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen
Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, XLVIII, p. 680. Or may we correct
*s*ú*k*î ít …

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

dî´dhitî (instr. sing.), 'they went along in pure devotion'? Dî´dhiti
seems to be what is called in III, 31, 1; IX, 102, 1. 8, *ri*tásya
dî´dhiti*h*.'

##### Verse 17.

Note <span id="an_4:2:17:1">1</span>. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p.
252.

Note <span id="an_4:2:17:2">2</span>. Evidently the pious men, not the
gods, form the subject. I propose to read, therefore, devâ´m (gen.
plur.) *g*ánimâ; cf. verse 18 devâ´nâm yát *g*ánimâ. They kindle Agni;
they strengthen Indra: in short, they treat the divine people as the
smith treats the metal.

Note <span id="an_4:2:17:3">3</span>. I do not enter here upon the
archaeological question as to the meaning of áya*h*. Comp. on this
much-discussed question especially Max Müller, Biographies of Words, p.
252 seq.; Schrader, Sprachvergleichung und Urgeschichte (2nd ed.), p.
271 seq.; von Bradke, Methode der arischen Alterthumswissenschaft, p. 93
seq.

Note <span id="an_4:2:17:4">4</span>. Cf. X, 61, 13. parishádvâna*h*
agman.

##### Verse 18.

Note <span id="an_4:2:18:1">1</span>. Pa*s*vá*h* is genitive sing.; it
depends on yûthâ´. Cf. V, 31, 1; VI, 19, 3.

Note <span id="an_4:2:18:2">2</span>. There is no reason for taking, as
Lanman (p. 516) does, kshumáti as acc. plur. neut., which would be
kshumâ´nti. See Joh. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen der Indogermanischen
Neutra, p. 237; Bartholomae, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIX, p. 493.
Bartholomae translates, 'bei einem wolhabenden.'

Note <span id="an_4:2:18:3">3</span>. Is this vocative ugra right? It
would be easy to correct, with Ludwig, ugrâ´ ('when the mighty
generations of the gods were near him') or ugrá*h*, as suggested by
Delbrück (Grassmann's Translation, vol. i, p. 573): 'the mighty one
(Agni) looked on them,' &c.

Note <span id="an_4:2:18:4">4</span>. I believe that Geldner (Ved.
Studien, I, 260, note 1) is right in contending that Urva*s*î, wherever
it occurs, is the name of an Apsaras and nothing else. The name of Âyu,
occurring in the fourth Pâda, confirms this; for Âyu, as is well known,
is the son of Purûravas and of the nymph Urva*s*î. Geldner translates,
'Selbst mit den

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sterblichen hatten
die Urva*s*îs Mitleid.' But I do not think that k*ri*p means 'having
compassion.' In my opinion we should, with Ludwig, supply *g*ánimâ to
mártânâm, so that devâ´nâm *g*ánimâ in the second Pâda corresponds with
mártânâm (*g*ánimâ) in the third. This *g*ánimâ is an accusative which
depends on ak*ri*pran ('they pined after …,' cf. IX, 85, 11. nâ´ke
supar*n*ám upapaptivâ´*m*sam gíra*h* venâ´nâm ak*ri*panta pûrvî´*h*; X,
74, 3. yé k*ri*pá*n*anta rátnam). Thus the meaning seems to be: When the
cows had been conquered, and when Agni looked over the generations of
the gods that were near him, the Urva*s*îs, i. e. the Apsarases such as
Urva*s*î, longed for the love of mortals such as Purûravas, and for the
propagation of the human generations; they gave birth to children such
as Âyu.

Note <span id="an_4:2:18:5">5</span>. Or 'of the indigent'? Or is
aryá*h* nom. plur. fem. referring to the Urva*s*îs? Or nom. sing. masc.
referring to Agni?

Note <span id="an_4:2:18:6">6</span>. On Âyu, see note 4. But I cannot
tell why he is called the nearer Âyu. Is this nearer Âyu opposed, as a
nearer or later (úpara) ancestor, to the pitára*h* párâsa*h*
pratnâ´sa*h*, the Aṅgiras, mentioned in verse 16? The same nearer Âyu
(úpara which stands there in opposition to pû´rvâbhi*h*) is mentioned
also in I, 104, 4, connected, as it seems, with some Apsarases. I do not
pretend to be able to interpret that very difficult verse, but I am
convinced that it has been misinterpreted both by Roth (Siebenzig
Lieder, p. vii) and by Bergaigne (I, 60).

##### Verse 19.

Note <span id="an_4:2:19:1">1</span>. I. e. the dawns have sent forth
their shine, which is a visible manifestation of the eternal law of
*Ri*ta.

Note <span id="an_4:2:19:2">2</span>. The construction is: we have been
good workers, brightening &c. The words, 'the brilliant dawns have shone
out *Ri*ta,' are a parenthesis.

##### Verse 20.

Note <span id="an_4:2:20:1">1</span>. The text is nearly identical with
the first hemistich of I, 73, 10 (see above).
