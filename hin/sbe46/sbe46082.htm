<p>1. This is that Agni with whom the desiring Indra took the pressed Soma into his body. Having obtained thousandfold strength like a horse, a racer&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:1:1">1</A>, thou art praised, O <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas!</p>  
<p>2&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:2:1">1</A>. Thy splendour, O Agni, which dwells in heaven and on earth, in the plants, O worshipful one, and in the waters, wherewith thou hast spread through the wide air&#8212;that light of thine is fierce, waving&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:2:2">2</A>, man-beholding.</p>  
<p>3. Agni, thou goest to the floods of heaven. Thou hast spoken to the gods who are liberal (?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:3:1">1</A>. (Thou goest) to the waters which (dwell) on high in the ether of the sun, and to those which approach below.</p>  
<p>4. May the fires of the soil united with those on the hill-sides&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:4:1">1</A>, without guile graciously accept our sacrifice and plentiful food free from all plague.</p>

<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi. The metre is Trish<I>t</I>ubh, except in verse 4 which is Anush<I>t</I>ubh.&#8212;A conjecture on the ritual use for which the hymn has been composed, see in the note on verse 4.&#8212;Verses 1&#8211;5 = VS. XII, 47&#8211;51; TS. IV, 2, 4, 2. 3; MS. II, 7, 11.&#8212;A sort of commentary on this hymn is found in the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a VII, 1, 1, 22 seq.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:22:1:1">1</A>. In the traditional text the words, 'a horse, a racer,' are accusatives. But it is the &aacute;tya who attains</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (san) the v&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>a and who is called v&acirc;<I>g</I>&iacute;n (comp. M.&nbsp;M., vol. xxxii, pp. 116, 442, and on s&aacute;pti, ibid. p. 102): see I, 130, 6; III, 2, 7; 38, 1 (V, 30, 14; IX, 93, 1; 96, 15, &amp;c.); VII, 24, 5; IX, 43, 5; 82, 2; 85, 5; 86, 3; 96, 20; X, 96, 10 (I, 52, 1, and III, 2, 3 do not contradict this). Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 105) believes that &aacute;tyam n&aacute; stands for &aacute;tya<I>h</I> n&aacute;, which seems impossible to me. But I think that we should correct the text and read &aacute;tya<I>h</I> n&aacute; s&aacute;pti<I>h</I>. The preceding accusatives have caused the blunder.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:22:2:1">1</A>. Comp. Grassmann, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XVI, 165.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:22:2:2">2</A>. Comp. ket&uacute;<I>h</I> ar<I>n</I>av&aacute;<I>h</I> s&ucirc;&acute;ryasya, VII, 63, 2.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:22:3:1">1</A>. In the translation of dh&iacute;sh<I>n</I>ya I have followed Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 87, though this translation is quite uncertain. Should the meaning be: 'the gods who dwell on the dhish<I>n</I>ya altars'?</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:22:4:1">1</A>. Agni pur&icirc;shya, i.&nbsp;e. the fire dwelling in the soil (comp. Roth in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, 64), is mentioned very frequently in the Mantras belonging to the Agni<I>k</I>ayana, i.&nbsp;e. to the construction of the brick altar. Agni is considered as residing in the soil used at that rite. Now in the Ya<I>g</I>us texts the whole of our hymn occurs among the texts to be recited at the Agni<I>k</I>ayana (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. IV, 2, 4, 2, &amp;c.; comp. also &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana <I>S</I>rautas&ucirc;tra IV, 8, 20). Perhaps we may conjecture, therefore, that the Agni<I>k</I>ayana rite in its simplest form was known already in the Rig-veda period, and that our hymn was destined for it.&#8212;The pr&acirc;va<I>n</I>a fires (fires dwelling on the hill-sides) may be the fires dwelling in the rivers which run down the prava<I>n</I>as or descents.</p>
