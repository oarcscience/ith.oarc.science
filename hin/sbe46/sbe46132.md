### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 28.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 22.

1\. Agni kindled has sent his light to the sky; turned towards the dawn
he shines far and wide. (The sacrificial ladle) goes forward with
adoration, rich in all treasures, magnifying the gods with sacrificial
food.

2\. Being kindled thou reignest over immortality; thou attendest for
welfare the man who prepares the sacrificial food. He whom thou
furtherest, acquires all wealth and puts in front hospitality (towards
thee), O Agni [1](sbe46132.htm#an_5:28:2:1).

3\. Agni, show thy prowess for the sake of great bliss. May thy
splendours be highest. Make our householdership easy to
conduct [1](sbe46132.htm#an_5:28:3:1). Set thy foot on the greatness of
those who show enmity to us.

4\. I adore thy beauty, Agni, who hast been kindled, who art highly
exalted. A bull, brilliant art thou. Thou art kindled at the sacrifices.

5\. Being kindled, Agni into whom offerings are poured, sacrifice to the
gods, best sacrificer, for thou art the carrier of oblations.

6\. Sacrifice into (Agni); exalt Agni, while the sacrifice is going on.
Choose him for your carrier of oblations.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Vi*s*vavârâ Âtreyî (cf. verse 1); the metre is
Trish*t*ubh in verses 1 and 3, *G*agatî in verse 2, Anush*t*ubh in verse
4, Gâyatrî in verses 5 and 6. Verse 3 = AV. VII, 73, 10; VS. XXXIII, 12;
TS. II, 4, 1, 1; 5, 2, 4; MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 5 = TS. II, 5, 8, 6.
Verses 5–6 = TB. III, 5, 2, 3.

The Sûkta is a later addition to the original Sa*m*hitâ.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:28:2:1">1</span>. Should not dhatte be accented? 'He
whom thou furtherest and (who) puts in front hospitality (towards thee),
O Agni, acquires all wealth.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:28:3:1">1</span>. Cf. X, 85, 23. sám *g*âspatyám
suyámam astu devâ*h*. The additions to the single Ma*nd*alas seem, as a
rule, to be of later origin than the hymns of the tenth Ma*nd*ala (see
H. O., Prolegomena, p. 265); so it may be conjectured that the author of
our verse imitated that passage of the great marriage hymn.
