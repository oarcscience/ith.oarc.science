### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 8.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 3–4.

1\. The worshippers of the gods anoint thee at the sacrifice, O lord of
the forest [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:1:1.md), with heavenly
honey [2](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:1:2.md). When standing upright bestow wealth
(on us) here, or when abiding in this mother's
lap [3](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:1:3.md).

2\. Situated in front of the kindled (fire), accepting our sacred spell
which protects from old age and gives valiant offspring, driving away
far from us lack of thoughts [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:2:1.md), rise
up [2](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:2:2.md) for the sake of great prosperity.

3\. Rise up, O lord of the forest, on the summit of the earth. Erected
by skilful erection bestow splendour on (the worshipper) who fits out
the sacrifice as a vehicle [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:3:1.md).

4\. A well-clothed youth dressed has come hither. He becomes more
excellent when born [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:4:1.md). Wise sages full of
pious thoughts, longing for the gods in their mind, bring him forth.

5\. He who has been born is born [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:5:1.md) in the
auspiciousness of days, growing up in the assembly and at the
sacrifice [2](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:5:2.md). Wise, active men purify him by
pious thoughts; the priest approaching the gods raises his
voice [3](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:5:3.md).

6\. You whom the worshippers of the gods have fastened down (in the
earth), or whom the axe has fashioned, O lord of the forest: may those
divine posts [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:6:1) standing (here.md) take care to
bestow on us treasures with offspring.

7\. (The posts) which have been hewn on the earth and fastened down, and
to which the sacrificial

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

ladles have been raised [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:7:1.md): may they, giving
bliss to our fields [2](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:7:2.md), eagerly seek precious
goods for us among the gods.

8\. May the Âdityas, the Rudras, the Vasus, the good leaders, Heaven and
Earth, the Earth [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:8:1.md) and the Air—may the gods
unanimously bless this sacrifice; may they raise up the banner of the
sacrifice (the Yûpa).

9\. Like swans ranging themselves in rows, arraying themselves in
brightness the sacrificial posts have come to us. Led up by the sages
they go forward as gods to the abode of the gods.

10\. Like horns of horned animals the sacrificial posts with their
head-pieces [1](sbe46068.htm#an_3:8:10:1.md) are seen on the earth. Hearing
(us) in the emulating call of the invoking (priests) may they protect us
in the racings of battles.

11\. O lord of the forest, rise with a hundred branches; may we rise
with a thousand branches (offspring)—thou whom this sharpened axe has
led forward to great prosperity.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is Trish*t*ubh (verses 3 and 7 Anush*t*ubh).

This Sûkta is a collection of liturgical verses that refer to the
erecting and anointing of the sacrificial post, and to the winding of a
rope about it. See Aitareya Brâhma*n*a II, 2; Â*s*valâyana *S*rautasûtra
III, 1, 8 seq.; *S*âṅkhâyana *S*rautasûtra V, 15, 2 seq.; Schwab, Das
Altindische Thieropfer, 68 seq.; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l’Histoire de
la Liturgie Védique, 16. On the ritual acts referring to the sacrificial
post which seem to be connected with ancient

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

tree-worship, comp. also H. O., Religion ties Veda, 90 seq., 256.—Verses
1–5 = TB. III, 6, 1, 1. 3; MS. IV, 13, 1. Verse 3 = MS. I, 2, 11. Verse
4 = TÂ. I, 27, 2. Verse 10 = TB. II, 4, 7, 11. Verse 11 = TS. I, 3, 5,
1; VI, 3, 3, 3.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:8:1:1">1</span>. The tree of which the sacrificial
post is made.

Note <span id="an_3:8:1:2">2</span>. The post is anointed with butter,
see Schwab, l. c., 69. This butter is spoken of as honey also in the
Ya*g*us, which refers to this rite, 'May the god Savit*ri* anoint thee
with honey,' Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ I, 3, 6, 1.

Note <span id="an_3:8:1:3">3</span>. In the lap of the mother Earth.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:8:2:1">1</span>. Ámati has nothing to do with the
verb am; it is the contrary of matí. See Rig-veda IV, II, 6. ámatim …
á*m*ha*h* … du*h*matím; X, 33, 2, and such passages of the younger Vedic
Sa*m*hitâs as Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XVII, 54 (ápa ámatim du*h*matím
bâ´dhamânâ*h*). The same is the opinion of Geldner (Ved. Studien, II,
184, note 4).

Note <span id="an_3:8:2:2">2</span>. The sacrificial post is addressed.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:8:3:1">1</span>. Comp. below, III, 24, 1.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:8:4:1">1</span>. The sacrificial post, round which a
rope of grass (Schwab, Thieropfer, p. 49) is tied, is compared here with
a well-dressed youth. This seems to contain an allusion to the Upanayana
ceremony, at which the youth was invested with the sacred girdle, and
which was considered as a second birth (comp. Pâda B: 'He becomes more
excellent when born'). There is no doubt that this rite is as old and
older than the Rig-veda; see H. O., Religion des Veda, 466 seq. It may
be noted that several G*ri*hya-sûtras prescribe the use of our verse at
the Upanayana (Â*s*valâyana I, 20, 9, &c.).

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:8:5:1">1</span>. Does this expression refer again to
the second birth (see the preceding note)?

Note <span id="an_3:8:5:2">2</span>. The text has vidáthe.

Note <span id="an_3:8:5:3">3</span>. Comp. V, 76, 1. út víprâ´*n*âm
devayâ´*h* vâ´*k*a*h* asthu*h*. The conjecture devayâ´m easily suggests
itself, but it is not necessary.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:8:6:1">1</span>. In the Rig-veda, sváru means the
sacrificial post itself, not, as in the later ritual texts (Schwab,
Thieropfer, pp. 11, 74), that splinter of the wood of the sacrificial
post (yûpa*s*akala), with regard to which Kâtyâyana (VI, 3, 17)
prescribes: 'Yûpa*s*akalam asyâm (scil. ra*s*anâyâm) avagûhati.' 'He
hides the splinter of the wood of the sacrificial post in the rope (tied
round the post).'—See Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 222.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:8:7:1">1</span>. Comp. below, IV, 6, 3.

Note <span id="an_3:8:7:2">2</span>. Comp. VIII, 71, 12. kshaítrâya
sâ´dhase.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_3:8:8:1">1</span>. The Earth is mentioned twice,
firstly together with the Heaven, in the compound Dyâ´vâ-Kshâ´mâ, and
then separately as P*ri*thivî.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_3:8:10:1">1</span>. On the wooden head-piece of the
sacrificial post (*k*ashâ´la), see Schwab, Das Thieropfer, p. 9.
