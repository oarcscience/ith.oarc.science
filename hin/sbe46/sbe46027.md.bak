### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 77.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 25.

1\. How shall we sacrifice to Agni? What words, agreeable to the god,
shall be addressed to him, the luminous one, who, being immortal and
righteous, the Hot*ri*, the best sacrificer, conveys the gods to the
mortals [1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:1:1.md)?

2\. Bring hither by adoration the Hot*ri* who is most beneficial in
sacrifices and righteous. When Agni repairs to the gods on behalf of the
mortal [1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:2:1.md), may he be attentive in his mind,
and may he perform the sacrifice [2](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:2:2.md).

3\. For he is wisdom [1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:3:1.md), he is manly, he is
straightforward; like Mitra he has become the charioteer of the
mysterious [2](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:3:2.md). Therefore the Aryan
clans [3](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:3:3.md), longing for the gods, address him,
the wonderful one, as the first at the sacrifices.

4\. May that Agni, the manliest of men, triumphant with riches
\[?\] [1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:4:1.md), come with help to our words, to our
devotion, and (to the devotion) of those most powerful liberal givers
who bent on the prize [2](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:4:2.md) have constantly
stirred up our prayers [3](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:4:3.md).

5\. Thus Agni, the righteous *G*âtavedas, has been praised by the
priestly Gotamas [1](sbe46027.htm#an_1:77:5:1.md). May he augment their
splendour and their strength. He the knowing one gains increase
according to his desire.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:77:1:1">1</span>. The construction is yá*h*
k*rin*óti devâ´n mártyeshu. Comp., for instance, X, 40, 2. ká*h* vâm …
k*rin*ute sadhásthe

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> â´. Ludwig
translates: der unter den sterblichen der unsterbliche hotar … schafft
die götter.—'Could it be ishk*rin*oti?' M. M.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:77:2:1">1</span>. The third Pâda of this verse has
nine syllables instead of eleven. If we read, as several times must be
done, mártyâya for mártâya, we get ten syllables, and the Pâda may
belong to the defective type mentioned above, 76, 1, note 2.

Note <span id="an_1:77:2:2">2</span>. *K*a seems to me to stand here, as
it several times does, in the first of the members of sentence connected
by it. See Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, 475. Prof. Max Müller believes
that it depends on yát: yát vé*h*, yát *k*a sá bódhâti, 'Bring hither
the Hot*ri* … so that Agni may invite the gods … and that he (the mortal
or Agni) may be attentive, &c.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:77:3:1">1</span>. Grassmann gives to krátu here and
in a number of other passages the meaning 'der Starke.' This is
inadmissible; comp. Bergaigne, III, 304.

Note <span id="an_1:77:3:2">2</span>. Here we have again a Pâda of ten
syllables (see verse 2, note I), unless bhût has dissyllabic value.
Prof. Max Müller translates this Pâda: 'like a friend he is the
charioteer of enormous wealth.'

Note <span id="an_1:77:3:3">3</span>. Comp. I, 96, 3 (see below).

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:77:4:1">1</span>. On ri*s*â´das, comp. above, I, 26,
4, note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:77:4:2">2</span>. Comp. I, 92, 8. There Ushas
receives the epithet vâ´*g*aprasûtâ.

Note <span id="an_1:77:4:3">3</span>. Comp. VII, 87, 3. spá*s*a*h*
Váru*n*asya … yé isháyanta mánma.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:77:5:1">1</span>. This is again a Pâda of ten
syllables.
