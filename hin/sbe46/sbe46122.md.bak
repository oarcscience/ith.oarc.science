### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 18.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 10.

1\. May Agni, beloved of many, the guest of the
house [1](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:1:1.md), be praised in the morning, the
immortal who delights [2](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:1:2.md) in all offerings
among the mortals.

2 [1](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:2:1.md). To Dvita who by the liberal power of
his dexterousness carries away injury [2](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:2:2.md),
this praiser of thine, O immortal, prepares Soma in the due way.

3\. I call for your sake Him who flames through long life, with the
speech that belongs to the liberal patrons [1](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:3:1.md)
whose chariot moves uninjured, O giver of
horses [2](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:3:2.md);

4\. And in whom (dwells) brilliant thought, who guard the hymns of
praise in their mouth, (whose) sacrificial grass is spread in the realm
of the sun: they have invested themselves with glory.

5\. On the liberal patrons who have given me fifty horses for my song of
praise [1](sbe46122.htm#an_5:18:5:1.md), bestow brilliant, mighty, high
glory, O Agni; on those men (bestow glory) with (valiant) men, O
immortal!

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is M*ri*ktavâhas Dvita Âtreya (see verse 2); the metre is
the same.—Verse 1 = SV. I, 85. Verse 5 = TB. II, 7, 5, 2.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:18:1:1">1</span>. Vi*s*á*h* … átithi*h*: cf. above,
V, 3, 5.

Note <span id="an_5:18:1:2">2</span>. On ran with the accusative,
compare Gaedicke, p. 76.

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:18:2:1">1</span>. Compare on this verse Macdonell,
Journal Roy. As. Soc., 1893, p. 463 seq.

Note <span id="an_5:18:2:2">2</span>. Dvita, who seems to be identified
with Agni, is, in the same way as Trita (see Bloomfield, Proceedings
Amer. Or. Soc., March, 1894, p. cxix seqq.), supposed to take away human
sin and all sorts of mischief and misfortune (cf. VIII, 47, 16. Tritâ´ya
*k*a Dvitâ´ya *k*a ûsha*h* dushvápnyam vaha). Thus he is invoked here as
carrying away m*ri*ktá, i. e. injury.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:18:3:1">1</span>. The speech of the priest belongs
to the sacrificer who has engaged him.

Note <span id="an_5:18:3:2">2</span>. This seems to be Agni, with an
evident allusion to the human giver of horses (see verse 5).

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:18:5:1">1</span>. Sadhástuti seems to be
instrumental. Cf. Lanman, p. 381.
