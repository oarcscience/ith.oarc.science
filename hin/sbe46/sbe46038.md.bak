### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 140.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 5–7.

1\. For him who sits on the Vedi (i. e. on the sacrificial bed), whose
foundations are pleasant, for the brilliant Agni bring
forward [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:1:1.md) a
receptacle [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:1:2.md), which is to him like a drink.
Clothe [1](#.md) the bright one in prayer as in a garment, him whose
chariot is light, whose colour is bright, the destroyer of darkness.

2\. He who has a twofold birth [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:2:1.md), presses
on towards the threefold food [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:2:2.md); what he
has eaten grows again after a year [3](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:2:3.md). With
the mouth and the tongue of the one he (shows himself as) the noble,
manly one; with the other (mouth) the stubborn (Agni) wipes off the
trees [4](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:2:4.md).

3\. Both his mothers [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:3:1.md), dwelling together,
immersed in darkness, and affrighted, proceed towards the young child
who stretches forward his tongue, who sparkling moves about thirstily,
whom men should attach to themselves, who agitates (the world), the
increaser of his father [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:3:2.md).

4\. Thy speedy (teams) [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:4:1.md) that strive to
break loose for the benefit of the man who acts as men do, the swift
ones, drawing black furrows-thy quick (horses), striving apart, the
agile, swift runners, incited by the wind, are yoked.

5\. When he stroking his wide course proceeds panting, thundering,
roaring, then those sparkling (rays) of his fly about wildly, displaying
wondrous darkness, a large sight [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:5:1.md).

6\. When he bends down over the brown
(plants) [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:6:1) like a busy (servant.md), he roars
and approaches his

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

wives like a bull. Displaying his power he adorns his bodies with
beauty; like a terrible beast, difficult to seize, he shakes his horns.

7\. He clasps (the plants, &c.) that have been laid together and have
been laid out [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:7:1.md). Knowing them, while they
know him, and being their own (friend or lover) he lies on them. They
grow again and attain godhead. They produce together another shape of
the parents [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:7:2.md).

8\. The long-haired virgins [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:8:1.md) have embraced
him. Having died they stand upright again for him (Agni) the living one
(or, for him the Âyu). Delivering them of old age he proceeds roaring,
procreating another vital spirit, an indestructible life.

9\. Licking everywhere the upper garment of the
mother [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:9:1.md), he spreads himself over the space
with his mightily devouring warriors, giving strength to everything that
has feet, licking and licking. The reddish white
one [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:9:2.md) follows her
ways [3](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:9:3.md).

10\. Shine, O Agni, among our liberal lords, for thou art a mightily
breathing bull, a friend of the house. Throwing down the (mothers) of
the young child [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:10:1.md) thou hast shone, (a
protector of thy friends) like a coat of mail in battles, hurrying
around.

11\. May this well-composed (prayer), O Agni, be more welcome to thee
than a badly-composed one—more welcome than even a welcome prayer. With
the bright light of thy body win thou treasures for us.

12\. Grant us, Agni, for our chariot and for our house a ship which has
its own rudders and which has feet [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:12:1.md),
which may save our strong men and our liberal lords and our people, and
which may be a shelter for us.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

13\. Approve, O Agni, our hymn alone. May Heaven and Earth and the
Rivers, delightful by their own nature [1](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:13:1.md),
going their way [2](sbe46038.htm#an_1:140:13:2), (choose for us.md) bliss
in cows and crops, long days; may the red (Dawns) choose food for us as
a choice boon.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Dîrghatamas Au*k*athya, the metre *G*agatî; the two last
verses are Trish*t*ubh (comp. above the note on the metre of I, 94); the
tenth verse, which is considered as either *G*agatî or Trish*t*ubh,
begins with one *G*agatî Pâda which is followed by three Pâdas in
Trish*t*ubh.—No verse occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:140:1:1">1</span>. Prá bharâ (Padap. prá bhara) and
vâsayâ (Padap. vâsaya) may be 1st person.

Note <span id="an_1:140:1:2">2</span>. Possibly the 'womb' or
'receptacle' (yóni) here means gh*ri*ta or the like, for it is said of
Agni that 'his womb is gh*ri*ta' (II, 3, 11), and he is called
gh*ri*táyoni*h*. This receptacle 'is to him like a drink,' because he
consumes the gh*ri*ta by which he is surrounded.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:140:2:1">1</span>. The terrestrial and the celestial
birth. Comp. Bergaigne, I, 28 seq.

Note <span id="an_1:140:2:2">2</span>. Bergaigne (I, 29) translates: '…
s’élance trois fois sur la nourriture,' which he explains as referring
to 'the three sacrifices of the morning, the midday, and the evening.'
But tri-v*rí*t clearly is an epithet of ánnam, not an adverb. The
explanation of Sâya*n*a, who understands the threefold food as
sacrificial butter, sacrificial cakes (puro*d*â*s*a), and Soma, may be
correct.

Note <span id="an_1:140:2:3">3</span>. On the locative sa*m*vatsaré,
comp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 117.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

Note <span id="an_1:140:2:4">4</span>. The last words evidently refer to
Agni's tongue, i. e. his flames, wiping off as it were the firewood. But
it is not clear what the tongue of the other one is. Sâya*n*a thinks of
the sacrificial spoon conceived as the tongue of the officiating priest:
which is very artificial, but perhaps not too artificial for a verse
like this.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:140:3:1">1</span>. The 'two mothers' of Agni may be
the two worlds (comp. Bergaigne, I, 238) or the two kindling-sticks.
-Ubhâ´ (masc.) instead of ubhé is to be remarked.

Note <span id="an_1:140:3:2">2</span>. Agni increases the wealth of the
worshipper who has lighted the fire and may thus be considered as Agni's
father. Comp. *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a XII, 5, 2, 15. Or the father may be
Heaven; on Agni as imparting strength to Heaven, see I, 164, 51.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:140:4:1">1</span>. The verse begins with feminines;
the *g*ûva*h* (comp. I, 134, 1), literally the quick ones, seem to be
something like the niyúta*h* of Agni. Then follow masculines; the horses
of Agni are male (comp. Bergaigne, I, 143).

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:140:5:1">1</span>. Comp. bhû´ri várpa*h* kárikrat,
III, 58, 9.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:140:6:1">1</span>. The brown ones, according to
Sâya*n*a, are the plants. They are called brown (babhru) also in X, 97,
1. 'Are they the dry leaves in which the spark is caught?' M. M.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:140:7:1">1</span>. Prof. Max Müller translates
sa*m*stíra*h* vish*t*íra*h*, '(the flames) that are together and apart.'

Note <span id="an_1:140:7:2">2</span>. The parents seem to be Heaven and
Earth, as Sâya*n*a explains.—Possibly pitró*h* depends on sá*k*â (comp.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

pitró*h* sá*k*â, II, 17, 7; IV, 5, 10), being with their parents they
produce a new shape.' Prof. Max Müller translates: 'They produce
together a different shape of their parents.'

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:140:8:1">1</span>. Should not the plants again be
referred to? 'I think it refers to the *g*vâlâs, the flames that are
hidden under the ashes and are lighted again.' M. M.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:140:9:1">1</span>. The mother is the Earth whose
surface Agni licks.

Note <span id="an_1:140:9:2">2</span>. I believe the Dawn is alluded to
whom the Vedic poets represent now as preceding Agni, now as following
him. See Bergaigne, II, pp. 14, 15.

Note <span id="an_1:140:9:3">3</span>. For vartanî´r áha of the
Sa*m*hitâpâ*th*a the Padapâ*th*a has vartaní*h* áha; comp. Rig-veda
Prâti*s*âkhya, Sûtra 259. Vartanî´*h* of course is correct. Comp. X,
172, I. gâ´va*h* sa*k*anta vartaním.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:140:10:1">1</span>. The mothers of the young child
are very probably the mothers of Agni represented as a young child. They
may be the Waters which Agni leaves resting on the surface of the earth
while he himself rises to heaven. Or the mothers may be the woods or
plants which he burns and thus throws them down as it were.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_1:140:12:1">1</span>. 'Which has feet in its own
rudders,' M. M. That the ship has feet seems to mean only that it has
the faculty of moving forward freely and quickly, and not that any real
beings having feet are designated by this comparison. The ship that
carries the worshippers across all dangers, is the protection and help
which Agni grants, or the sacrifice which he helps to perform.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_1:140:13:1">1</span>. Comp. Geldner, Vedische Studien,
I, 275.

Note <span id="an_1:140:13:2">2</span>. Yánta*h* seems to be corrupt;
one or two syllables are wanting. Something like yâtáyanta*h* (IX, 39,
2) or vardháyanta*h*, or, as Prof. Max Müller proposes, vyánta*h* would
do. He translates: 'May Heaven and Earth and the Rivers … accepting
(vyánta*h*) sacrifices of milk and corn choose for us, and may the Dawns
choose for us food as a boon for many days.'—Cf. Lanman, pp. 510, 539.
