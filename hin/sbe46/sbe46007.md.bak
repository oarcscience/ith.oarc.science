### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 27.

#### ASH*T*AKA I ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 22–24.

A.

1\. With reverence I shall worship thee who art long-tailed like a
horse, Agni, the king of worship.

2\. May he, our son of strength [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:2:1.md),
proceeding on his broad way, the propitious, become bountiful to us.

3\. Thus protect us always, thou who hast a full life, from the mortal
who seeks to do us harm [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:3:1.md), whether near or
afar.

4\. And mayest thou, O Agni, announce to the gods this our newest
efficient Gâyatra song.

5\. Let us partake of all booty that is highest and that is middle
(i. e. that dwells in the highest and in the middle world); help us to
the wealth that is nearest.

6\. O god with bright splendour, thou art the distributor. Thou
instantly flowest for the liberal giver in the wave of the river, near
at hand.

B.

7\. The mortal, O Agni, whom thou protectest in battles, whom thou
speedest in the races [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:7:1.md), he will command
constant nourishment:

8\. Whosoever he may be, no one will overtake him, O conqueror (Agni)!
His strength [2](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:8:2.md) is glorious.

9\. May he (the man), known among all
tribes [3](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:9:3.md), win the race with his horses; may
he with the help of his priests become a gainer.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

C.

10\. O *G*arâbodha [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:10:1.md)! Accomplish this
(task) for every house [2](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:10:2.md): a beautiful song
of praise for worshipful Rudra [3](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:10:3.md).

11\. May he, the great, the immeasurable, the smoke-bannered, rich in
splendour, incite us to (pious) thoughts and to strength.

12\. May he hear us, like the rich lord of a clan, the banner of the
gods, on behalf of our hymns, Agni with bright light.

13\. Reverence to the great ones, reverence to the lesser ones!
Reverence to the young, reverence to the
old [1](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:13:1.md)! Let us sacrifice to the gods, if we
can. May I not, O gods, fall as a victim to the curse of my
better [2](sbe46007.htm#an_1:27:13:2.md).

#### NOTES.

The hymn is ascribed to *S*una*hs*epa (see note on I, 26). The metre is
Gâyatrî; the last verse is Trish*t*ubh.

The laws of arrangement of the Sa*m*hitâ show that this hymn, which has
thirteen verses and follows after a hymn of ten verses belonging to the
same deity, must be divided into a number of minor hymns. On the
question of this division some further light is thrown by the metre. The
first six verses and then again the verses 10–12 are composed in the
trochaic form of the Gâyatrî metre; of the verses 7–9, on the other
hand, not a single Pâda shows the characteristics of that metre. I
believe, therefore, that the verses 1–6 form one hymn by themselves, or
possibly two hymns of three verses each. Then follow two hymns: verses
7–9, 10–12. As to verse 13, which is composed in a different metre, it
is difficult to determine its exact nature. It may be a later addition:
though in that case

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

we shall hardly be able to explain why it was placed at the end of the
hymns addressed to Agni, to which god it contains no reference whatever.
Or it may form part of the hymn 10–12: in that case we should have to
consider this whole hymn, which would then violate the rules of
arrangement, as an addition to the original collection.

We may add that the Sâma-veda gives the first twelve verses of this
Sûkta so as to form four independent hymns: 1–3 = SV. II, 984–6; 4. 6. 5
= SV. II, 847–9; 7–9 = SV. II, 765–7; 10–12 = SV. II, 1013–15. Besides,
verse 1 is found in SV. I, 17. Verse 4 = SV. I, 28; TÂr. IV, 11, 8.
Verse 7 = VS. VI, 29; TS. I, 3, 13, 2; MS. I, 3, 1. Verse 10 = SV. I,
15. Comp. Bergaigne, Recherches sur l’histoire de la Sa*m*hitâ, II, pp.
7–8; H. O., Prolegomena, 225–226.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:27:2:1">1</span>. It requires a stronger belief in
the infallibility of Vedic text tradition than I possess, not to change
*s*ávasâ into *s*ávasa*h*. I do not think that I, 62, 9 (sánemi sakhyám
svapasyámâna*h* sûnû*h* dâdhâra *s*ávasâ sudá*m*sâ*h*) furnishes a
sufficient argument against this conjecture.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:27:3:1">1</span>. Grassmann reads aghaâyó*h* for the
sake of the metre; Prof. Max Muller proposes ăghâyô̆*h*. I think that the
missing syllable should be gained by disyllabic pronunciation of -ât in
mártyât or rather mártiât. Comp. my Prolegomena 185 and the quotations
given there in note 1.

### Verses 7–9.

Note <span id="an_1:27:7:1">1</span>. It is not my intention to enter
here into a new discussion on so frequently discussed a word as vâ*g*a.
I have translated it in verses 7, 9 by 'race,' in verse 8 by 'strength.'

Note <span id="an_1:27:8:2">2</span>. The expression used in verses 7
and 8 should be compared especially with VII, 40, 3. sá*h* ít ugrá*h*
astu maruta*h* sá*h* *s*ushmî´ yám mártyam p*ri*shada*s*vâ*h* ávâtha,
utá îm agní*h* sárasvatî *g*unánti ná tásya râyá*h* paryetâ´ asti.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

Note <span id="an_1:27:9:3">3</span>. Vi*s*va*k*arsha*n*i, a frequent
epithet of Agni, here refers to the mortal hero protected by Agni; comp.
I, 64, 14 (vol. xxxii, p. 108); X, 93, 10 (vi*s*vá*k*arsha*n*i
*s*ráva*h*).

### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:27:10:1">1</span>. I think that Ludwig is right in
taking *G*arâbodha for a proper name.

Note <span id="an_1:27:10:2">2</span>. Vi*s*é-vi*s*e may possibly depend
on ya*gñ*íyâya, so that we should have to translate: 'Administer this
task: a beautiful song of praise to Rudra who is worshipful for every
house.'

Note <span id="an_1:27:10:3">3</span>. Rudra is here a designation of
Agni, as the next verses show. Comp. Pischel-Geldner, I, 56.

### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_1:27:13:1">1</span>. The word â*s*iná, 'old,'
occurring only here, is doubtful. In III, 1, 6; IV, 33, 3; X, 39, 4,
sana or sanaya stands in contrast with yuvan. Shall we conjecture
náma*h* â´ sánebhya*h*?'

Note <span id="an_1:27:13:2">2</span>. The last Pâda of this verse, mâ´
*g*yâ´yasa*h* *s*ámsam â´ v*ri*kshi devâ*h* ('May I not, O gods, neglect
the praise of the greatest,' Muir, V, 12), offers some difficulty. It
may be doubted whether â´ v*ri*kshi belongs to â-v*rig* or to â-vra*sk*.

Let us see what would be the meaning of the passage, if we were to
decide for â-v*rig*. VIII, 101, 16 the cow speaks: devî´m devébhya*h*
pári eyúshîm gâ´m â´ mâ av*ri*kta mártya*h* dabhrá*k*etâ*h*, 'Me the
goddess, the cow, who has come hither from the gods, the weak-minded
mortal has appropriated.' *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a XIV, 9, 4, 3. ya eva*m*
vidvân adhopahâsa*m* *k*araty â sa strî*n*â*m* suk*ri*ta*m* v*ri*ṅkte
<sup><span class="small">ऽ</span></sup> tha ya idam avidvân
adhopahâsa*m* *k*araty âsya striya*h* suk*ri*ta*m* v*riñg*ate, 'He who
knowing this, &c., appropriates the good works of the women. But the
women appropriate the good works of him who without knowing this,' &c.
In Rig-veda X, 159, 5 also we probably have a form of â-v*rig*. There we
find the triumphant utterance

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

of a wife who has gained superiority over her fellow-wives: â
av*ri*ksham anyâsâm vár*k*a*h*, 'I have won for myself the splendour of
the other wives.' We may conclude from these passages that our Pâda, if
â´ v*ri*kshi is derived from â-v*rig*, would mean: 'May I not draw on
myself the curse of my better.'

On the other hand we have a great number of passages—they have been
collected by Ludwig, IV, 249 seq.—in which the verb â-vra*sk* appears.
Referring the reader for fuller information to Ludwig, I content myself
here with selecting one or two of these passages. Taitt. Sa*m*h. II, 4,
11, 4. devatâbhyo vâ esha â v*risk*yate yo yakshya ity uktvâ na
ya*g*ate. In translating this we should remember that vra*sk* means 'to
cut down;' â-vra*sk*, therefore, must be 'to cut down so that the object
reaches a certain destination.' I translate therefore: 'He who says, "I
shall sacrifice," and does not sacrifice, is cut down for the
deities,'—i. e. he is dedicated or forfeited to the deities and is thus
destroyed (comp. a different explanation of â-vra*sk* by Delbrück,
Altindische Syntax, 143). In other passages not the dative but the
locative is used for indicating the being to whom somebody is forfeited;
see Atharva-veda XII, 4, 6. 12. 26; XV, 12, 6. 10.

A Rig-vedic passage containing â-vra*sk* (with the dative) is X, 87, 18.
â´ v*risk*yantâm áditaye durévâ*h*, 'May the evil-doers be forfeited to
Aditi.'

Several times we find the first person aor. med. in the same form as in
our passage, â v*ri*kshi; see, for instance, the Nivid formula to the
Vi*s*ve devâ*h*, *S*âṅkhâyana *S*rautasûtra VIII, 21. In this Nivid, the
text of which as given by Hillebrandt is not quite identical with that
of Ludwig, we read according to Hillebrandt's edition: mâ vo devâ
avi*s*asâ mâ vi*s*asâyur â v*ri*kshi. This mâ … â v*ri*kshi looks quite
similar to our passage. The same may be said of Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ I,
6, 6, 1. yat te tapas tasmai te mâv*ri*kshi. Considering such passages
it is difficult not to believe that it is the verb â vra*sk* which we
have before us in our verse. It must be admitted indeed that the
accusative

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

*s*a*m*sam does not agree with the construction of the later Vedic
passages. Can the accusative stand in the ancient language of the
Rig-veda in the same connection in which we have found the dative and
the locative? So that â-vra*sk* (in the middle or passive) with the
accusative would mean: to be cut down in the direction towards another
being, i. e. being forfeited to that being? In that case the translation
of our passage would be: 'May I not, O gods, fall as a victim to the
praise (or rather, to the curse) of my better.' If this explanation of
the accusative is thought too bold, we should propose to correct the
text so as to get a dative or, which would suit the metre better, a
locative: mâ´ *g*yâ´yasa*h* *s*á*m*sâya (or *s*á*m*se) â´ v*ri*kshi
devâ*h*.
