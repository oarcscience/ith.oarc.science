### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 1.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 12–13.

1\. Agni has been wakened by the fuel of men, in face of the Dawn who
approaches like a milch-cow. His flames stream forward to the sky like
quick (birds) that fly up to a branch.

2\. The Hot*ri* has been wakened that there may be sacrifice for the
gods. Gracious Agni has stood upright in the morning. When he has been
kindled, his brilliant stream of flames has been seen. The great god has
been released from darkness.

3\. When he has wakened the string of the crowd (of
worshippers) [1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:3:1.md), the bright Agni anoints
himself with bright cows [2](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:3:2.md). Then the
Dakshi*n*â is yoked, striving for gain [3](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:3:3.md). He
who stands upright has, by the sacrificial ladles, sucked her who lies
extended [4](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:3:4.md).

4\. Towards Agni the minds of the pious turn together as (all) eyes
(turn) to the sun. When both Dawns of different
colour [1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:4:1.md) give birth to him, the white racer
is born at the beginning of days.

5\. For He, the noble one, has been born at the beginning of days, the
red one has been laid down in the woods that have been laid down. Agni,
the Hot*ri*, the best sacrificer, has sat down, bestowing his seven
treasures on every house.

6\. Agni, the Hot*ri*, the best sacrificer, sat down in the mother's
lap, in the sweet-smelling place, the young sage growing up in many
places, the righteous one, the supporter of tribes, and kindled in their
midst.

7\. They magnify with adorations that priest efficacious at sacrifices,
Agni the Hot*ri*, who has spread himself over heaven and earth according
to *Ri*ta; they groom (Agni), the own racer (of men), with Gh*ri*ta.

8\. He who likes to be groomed, is groomed in his own (abode), the
house-friend [1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:8:1.md), praised by sages, our
auspicious guest, the bull with a thousand horns who has the strength of
such a one. O Agni! By this power thou surpassest all other (beings).

9\. O Agni! Thou overtakest all other (beings) in one moment (for the
sake of him) to whom Thou hast become visible as the fairest one, thou
who shouldst be magnified, the wonderful, brilliant one, the beloved
guest of human clans.

10\. To thee, O youngest (god), the tribes bring tribute, O Agni, from
near and far. Behold [1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:10:1.md) the grace of the most
glorious (god)! Mighty, O Agni, is thy great and glorious shelter.

11\. Mount to-day, O shining Agni, the shining car, in the neighbourhood
of the worshipful (gods). Knowing the paths, the wide
air [1](sbe46105.htm#an_5:1:11:1.md), bring hither the gods that they may
eat the oblation.

12\. We have pronounced an adoring speech to the holy sage, to the manly
bull. Gavish*th*ira adoringly has sent his song of praise to Agni as the
gold (i. e. the sun) far-reaching (is sent by the gods upward) to the
sky.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shis are Budha Âtreya (cf. verse 1, ábodhi) and Gavish*th*ira
Âtreya (cf. verse 12). The metre is Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 1 = SV. I, 73;
AV. XIII, 2, 46; VS. XV, 24; TS.

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> IV, 4, 4, 1.
Verses 1–2 = MS. II, 13, 7. Verses 1–3 = SV. II, 1096–1098. Verse 5 =
TS. IV, I, 3, 4. Verse 6 = MS. IV, 11, 1; TB. I, 3, 14, 1. Verse 9 = TB.
II, 4, 7, 10. Verse 10 = MS. IV, 11, 4; TB. II, 4, 7, 9. Verse 12 = MS.
II, 13, 7; TB. IV, 4, 4, 2; VS. XV, 25.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:1:3:1">1</span>. The meaning seems to be: when Agni
has set into motion the string (representing the prayers, &c.) by which
the worshippers tie and instigate him and the other powers of the
sacrifice. Cf. IV, I, 9. prá tám (scil. agním) mahyâ´ ra*s*anáyâ
nayanti; IX, 87, 1. á*s*vam ná tvâ (scil. sómam) vâ*g*ínam
mar*g*áyanta*h* á*kkh*a barhí*h* ra*s*anâ´bhi*h* nayanti. See also I,
163, 4. 5.

Note <span id="an_5:1:3:2">2</span>. I. e. with bright gh*ri*ta.

Note <span id="an_5:1:3:3">3</span>. The Dakshi*n*â or sacrificial gift
offered by the Ya*g*amâna to the ministrant priests, is represented here
as a car which is yoked in the morning. Cf. Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, I,
128; III, 283.

Note <span id="an_5:1:3:4">4</span>. 'He who stands upright' is Agni;
'she who lies extended' seems to be the cow, i. e. the gh*ri*ta which
Agni sucks by means of the sacrificial ladles.—See also Pischel,
Vedische Studien, II, 113, from whose interpretation I differ.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:1:4:1">1</span>. I. e. Night and Dawn.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_5:1:8:1">1</span>. I cannot adopt the conjectures of
Bartholomae (Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 197) on své dámûnâ*h*.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_5:1:10:1">1</span>. The human worshipper seems to be
addressed; the 'most glorious one' is very probably Agni.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_5:1:11:1">1</span>. Vidvân, which may be construed
with the genitive or with the accusative, stands here with both cases.
