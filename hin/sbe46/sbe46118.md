### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 14.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 6.

1\. Awaken [1](sbe46118.htm#an_5:14:1:1) Agni by thy song of praise,
kindling (him) the immortal one. May he place our offerings among the
gods.

2\. Him, the immortal god, the mortals magnify at their sacrifices, the
best sacrificer among the tribe of men.

3\. Him indeed they all magnify, the god, with the (sacrificial) ladle
that overflows with gh*ri*ta, Agni, in order that he may bear the
oblation.

4\. Agni when born has shone, killing the Dasyus, (killing) darkness by
light. He has found the cows, the waters, the
sun [1](sbe46118.htm#an_5:14:4:1).

5\. Worship Agni, the sage who should be magnified, whose back is
covered with gh*ri*ta. May he come and hear my
call [1](sbe46118.htm#an_5:14:5:1).

6\. They have made Agni grow by gh*ri*ta, him who dwells among all
tribes, and by longing, eloquent praises.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 1 = TS. IV, 1, 11, 4; MS. IV, 10, 1;
VS. XXII, 15. Verse 3 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 8; MS. IV, 10, 1. Verse 4 = MS.
IV, 10, 2.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:14:1:1">1</span>. We have no reason and, unless we
write bodhayâ, no right for taking bodhaya as an equivalent of bodhayâni
(Ludwig).

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:14:4:1">1</span>. Agni is considered here, as is
done frequently, as the performer of deeds which properly belong to
Indra (see H. O., Religion des Veda, 98 seq.). Indra is the conqueror of
the cows and of the waters; as to the sun, it may be said of both gods
with the same right that they have acquired it for mankind (Religion des
Veda, 110 seq.; 150 seq.).

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:14:5:1">1</span>. Although me can be accusative
(Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, XXXV,
714 seq.), I have no doubt that it is here genitive, and depends on
hávam. Cf. II, 24, 15. véshi me hávam; X, 61, 4. vîtám me ya*gñ*ám.
