### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 1.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 13–16.

1\. Thou wilt have me, O Agni, as a strong (master) of
Soma [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:1.md): therefore thou hast made me the
carrier (of the gods?) to perform worship at the
sacrifice [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:2.md). Sending my thoughts to the
gods [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:3) I make the (press-.md) stone
ready [4](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:4.md); I toil, O Agni: find thou pleasure
in thy own body [5](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:5.md).

2 [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:2:1.md). Eastward we have turned the
sacrifice [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:2:2.md); may the prayer increase. They
honoured Agni with fuel and adoration. They have taught (him) the
sacrificial ordinances of the sages of
Heaven [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:2:3). Though he (Agni.md) is clever and
strong, they have sought a way for him.

3\. He has conceived freshness [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:3:1.md), the wise
one of pure [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:3:2.md) powers, he who is by his birth
well allied with Heaven and Earth. The gods have found Agni the
conspicuous one in the waters, in the work [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:3:3.md)
of the sisters.

4\. The seven young (wives) [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:4:1.md) made the
blessed one grow who had been born white, ruddy in his growth. They ran
up to him like mares [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:4:2.md) to a newborn foal. The
gods wondered at Agni at his birth.

5\. Spreading with his bright limbs to the aerial space, purifying his
power [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:5:1.md) by wise purifications, clothing
himself in light, the life of the waters [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:5:2.md),
he creates mighty, perfect beauty.

6\. He has gone to (the waters) who do not eat, the undeceived ones, the
young (daughters) of Heaven who are not clothed and (yet) are not naked.

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Here the former
young (women) having the same origin, the seven
sounds [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:6:1.md) have conceived one germ.

7\. His compact masses assuming every shape are spread in the womb of
ghee, in the streaming of honey. There the swelling milch-cows have
stationed themselves. Great are the parents of the wonderfully mighty
(Agni) who are turned towards each other [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:7:1.md).

8\. Having been carried (in the waters) thou hast shone forth, O son of
strength, assuming wonderful shapes brilliant and fierce. The streams of
honey and ghee drip, where the male has grown by wisdom.

9\. By (his) nature he has found his father's
udder [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:1.md); he has sent forth his streams and
his showers [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:2.md).
Walking [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:3.md) hidden to his dear friends he has
not been hidden to the young (daughters) of
Heaven [4](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:4.md).

10\. He bore (in his womb) the germ of the sire, of the father who begat
him [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:10:1). He, being one, sucked many (nurses.md)
rich in milk [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:10:2.md). Observe for this manly,
bright one the two wives bound in kinship, belonging to
men [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:10:3.md).

11\. The great one has grown up in the wide unbounded
space [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:1). The Waters (have made) Agni (grow.md):
for many glorious ones [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:2) (have come.md)
together [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:3.md). He lay in the womb of *Ri*ta,
the domestic (god) Agni, in the work [4](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:4.md) of
the uterine sisters.

12\. Like a horse that carries (the prize), in the assembly of the great
(waters) [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:1.md), visible to his
son [2](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:2.md), he whose … is
light [3](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:3.md): he who as father begat the ruddy
cows [4](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:4.md), he the son of the waters is the most
manly, restless [5](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:5.md) Agni.

13\. To him, the glorious son of the waters and of the plants, the
blessed wood [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:13:1.md) has given birth, in his many
shapes. Even the gods, for they agreed in

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

their mind, honoured him who had been born the most wonderful and
strong.

14\. Mighty rays of light like brilliant lightnings, milking (the sap
of) immortality in the boundless stable, accompanied Agni whose … is
light [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:14:1.md), who had grown up in his own house,
as it were in secret.

15\. I magnify thee, worshipping thee with offerings; I magnify (thee)
desirous of thy friendship, of thy favour. Together with the gods give
help to him who praises thee, and protect us with thy domestic faces.

16\. As thy followers, O Agni, best leader, winning all precious
(treasures), pressing onward with fertile glory, may we overcome the
godless who seek to combat us.

17\. Thou hast been here as the banner of the gods, Agni, joy-giving,
knowing all wisdom. As the domestic (god) thou hast harboured the
mortals. As the charioteer thou goest along straightway after the gods.

18\. The immortal, the king, has sat down in the dwelling of the
mortals, performing the sacrifices [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:18:1.md). He the
ghee-faced one has shone forth widely, Agni knowing all wisdom.

19 [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:19:1.md). Come to us with thy gracious
friendship, speeding, great, with thy great blessings. Bestow on us
plentiful victorious wealth; make our share glorious and adorned with
fine speech.

20\. These old births of thine, O Agni, and the recent ones I have told
forth to thee the ancient one. These great libations (of Soma) have been
prepared for the manly one; generation by generation *G*âtavedas has
been placed (on the altar).

21\. *G*âtavedas, placed (on the altar) generation

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

after generation, is kindled by the Vi*s*vâmitras, the indefatigable (or
everlasting). May we dwell in the grace of him the worshipful, yea, in
his blissful kindness.

22\. Bring thou, O strong one, this sacrifice of ours to the gods, O
wise one, as a liberal giver. Bestow on us, O Hot*ri*, abundant food;
Agni, obtain by sacrificing mighty wealth for us.

23\. Procure, O Agni, for ever, to him who implores thee, (the gift of)
nourishment [1](sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:23:1.md), the wonderful acquiring of
the cow. May a son be ours, offspring that continues our race. Agni, may
this favour of thine abide with us!

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Vi*s*vâmitra Gâthina, the metre Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 1 =
MS. IV, 11, 2. Verse 19 = MS. IV, 14, 15. Verse 23 = SV. I, 76; VS. XII,
51; TS. IV, 2, 4, 3; MS. II, 7, 11; IV, 11, 1; 12, 3.

Comp. on this hymn Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 157 seq., and the
article of Regnaud, Études Védiques, l’hymne III, 1 du Rig-Veda.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:1:1:1">1</span>. Vákshi, which is very frequent as
2nd person of vah, occurs also as belonging to va*s* (see VII, 98, 2.
pîtím ít asya vakshi), and in this sense no doubt it is to be understood
in our passage.—Ludwig and Geldner take tavásam vákshi agne as a
parenthesis. G. translates: 'Du hast mich zu deinem Somaschenken—denn
dich gelüstet nach dem starken, o Agni—bestellt, dass ich vor den Weisen
opfern soll.' To me it seems more natural to understand the first Pâda
as one continual clause; vákshi is accented on account of the logical
dependence in which this clause

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

stands, the clause being considered, even without a subordinating word,
as a dependent one. See Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 42; A. Mayr,
Sitzungsberichte der phil. hist. Classe der Kais. Akademie der
Wissenschaften, Vol. LXVIII (Vienna, 1871), 248, 259.—If we were to
consider vákshi as a locative infinitive (see Bartholomae's theory on
such infinitives, Indogermanische Forschungen, II, 271 seqq.), the
translation would be: 'Thou hast made me, O Agni, a strong carrier of
Soma at the carrying (of the oblations),' &c. I do not think, however,
this interpretation of vákshi very probable, nor is it, as far as I can
see, favoured by any passage which contains the word.—For sómasya
tavásam, Prof. Max Müller suggests the translation 'strong of Soma,'
i. e. full of Soma.

Note <span id="an_3:1:1:2">2</span>. The text has vidáthe.

Note <span id="an_3:1:1:3">3</span>. The traditional text has á*kkh*a
dî´dyat, which means, 'shining towards or as far as the gods.' The verb
dî with a*kkh*a occurs still in two other passages of this Ma*nd*ala, in
15, 5 and 55, 3. In the first of these passages the text seems to be
correct: devâ´n á*kkh*a dî´dyâna*h*, 'shining as far as the gods.' In
the second passage I believe that we ought to read á*kkh*a dîdhye
pûrvyâ´*n*i, 'I think of the ancient things,' or more exactly, 'I send
my thoughts to the ancient things.' In the same way it seems to me very
probable that in our verse dî´dhyat would be the correct reading, for
the participle refers to the priest who says of himself, 'I make the
stone ready;' and this priest does not send his light (dî´dyat) but his
thoughts (dî´dhyat) to the gods. Comp. I, 132, 5 = 139, 1. devâ´n
á*kkh*a ná dhîtáya*h*; III, 4, 3, and numerous passages which represent
the mati, the gira*h*, &c., as going towards (á*kkh*a) the gods, such as
III, 39, 1; 42, 3; VII, 10, 3; 36, 9; X, 43, 1; 47, 6.—Prof. von Roth
(Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Ges., XLVIII, 108) speaks of the 'häufige
Verwechslungen von Formen der beiden Wurzeln 2 dî scheinen und 1 dhî
wahrnehmen, denken.' The reading dî´dyat in our verse, and dîdye III,
55, 3, may rest on the influence of III, 15, 3. devâ´n á*kkh*â
dî´dyâna*h*.

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

Note <span id="an_3:1:1:4">4</span>. On the accent of yu*ñg*é the same
may be said as above (note 1) regarding the accent of vákshi.

Note <span id="an_3:1:1:5">5</span>. I. e. cause the fire to flare up.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:1:2:1">1</span>. The verses 2, 3, and 4 have been
translated by Bergaigne, Religion Védique, I, 109.

Note <span id="an_3:1:2:2">2</span>. Many sacrificial rites are
performed from west to cast; comp. with regard to the Barhis, I, 188, 4;
X, 110, 4; with regard to the sacrificial ladle, III, 6, 1; V, 28, 1; to
the Havirdhânas, Vâ*g*as. Sa*m*hitâ V, 17. Thus the whole sacrifice is
spoken of as proceeding in an eastward direction; see X, 66, 12.
prâ´*ñk*am na*h* ya*gñ*ám prá nayata; X, 87, 9. ya*gñ*ám prâ´*ñk*am …
prá naya.

Note <span id="an_3:1:2:3">3</span>. Comp. Mahâbhârata XIV, 280. tasmât
svaya*m* *s*âdhi ya*gñ*e vidhâ´nam. Vidátha indeed is here an equivalent
of vidhâna.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:1:3:1">1</span>. The meaning seems to be that Agni
won vigour (máya*h*) by dwelling in the waters (see Pâda 3); comp. the
well-known words â´pa*h* hí sthá maya*h*-bhûva*h* (X, 9, I), 'for you, O
waters, give vigour.'

Note <span id="an_3:1:3:2">2</span>. More exactly, of purified
faculties.

Note <span id="an_3:1:3:3">3</span>. The accent apási, instead of ápasi,
looks very suspicious. It is easy, but perhaps too easy, to correct
ápasi, as possibly in III, 6, 7. ápa*h* should be read for apá*h*. (In
I, 31, 8; 151, 4 Grassmann is wrong in assuming a neutral stem apás-
'die Arbeit.') To me Ludwig's conjecture upási (in the lap of the
sisters, i. e. of the waters) seems excellent. Upási occurs in V, 43, 7;
X, 27, 13 in the meaning of upásthe. Thus upási svás*rîn*âm would be the
same as apâ´m upásthe; comp. I, 144, 2; VI, 8, 4; IX, 86, 25; X, 45, 3;
46, 1. 2, &c.—Comp. below, verse 11, note 4.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:1:4:1">1</span>. Of course the seven wives are the
rivers or waters.

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

Note <span id="an_3:1:4:2">2</span>. I cannot adopt Prof. Weber's
conjecture asṽa*h* (Altiranische Sternnamen, 10). His translation is:
'Die Götter liefen zu dem wundersamen Agni bei seiner Geburt (neugierig)
hinzu, wie die jungen Mädchen zu einem neugebornen Kinde.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:1:5:1">1</span>. For krátum punâná*h*, cf. III, 31,
16; VIII, 12, 11; 13, I; 53, 6.

Note <span id="an_3:1:5:2">2</span>. I take pári as belonging to
vásâna*h*; *s*ó*k*i*h* and â´yu*h* are objects. Comp. X, 16, 5. â´yu*h*
vásâna*h*; X, 53, 3. sá*h* â´yu*h* â´ agâ´t surabhí*h* vásâna*h*.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:1:6:1">1</span>. The number of the seven sounds
(comp. Sten Konow, Das Sâmavidhâna-brâ´hma*n*a, p. 33, note 3) seems to
be connected with the seven *Ri*shis, see IX, 103, 3. vâ´*n*î*h*
*rí*shî*n*âm saptá (comp. IX, 62, 17). The seven sounds seem to be
identified with the seven rivers also in III, 7, 1 (see below). Comp.
Bergaigne, Religion Védique, II, 132; H. O., Religion des Veda, 117,
note 1.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:1:7:1">1</span>. Heaven and Earth.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_3:1:9:1">1</span>. Comp. Bergaigne, Religion Védique,
II, 99.

Note <span id="an_3:1:9:2">2</span>. See volume xxxii, 441 seq. (I, 2,
3, note 1).

Note <span id="an_3:1:9:3">3</span>. Here I believe we have an
anacoluthon. The poet seems to have intended to say, 'Him who walked …
the daughters of Heaven saw.'—Prof. Max Müller translates this
hemistich: 'He found him (the father) moving along with dear friends,
with the young maidens of Heaven—he was not hidden.'

Note <span id="an_3:1:9:4">4</span>. Agni was hidden to the gods but not
to the waters.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_3:1:10:1">1</span>. The verse X, 3, 2, though very
obscure, seems to contain a similar idea. Should the meaning be that

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni bears in his
womb the Dawn, the daughter of Heaven?

Note <span id="an_3:1:10:2">2</span>. The waters.

Note <span id="an_3:1:10:3">3</span>. This phrase, which I have
translated as literally as possible, is very obscure. The two wives seem
to be wives of Agni. Are they Night and Dawn (the two sabardúghe, III,
55, 12?), whose designation as 'belonging to men' seems not to be
impossible? Or the two kindling-sticks (comp. V, 47, 5)? Or the two
Darvis (V, 6, 9)?

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_3:1:11:1">1</span>. Comp. V, 42, 17. uraú devâ*h*
anibâdhé syâma.

Note <span id="an_3:1:11:2">2</span>. This is feminine.

Note <span id="an_3:1:11:3">3</span>. The phrase ya*s*ása*h* sám hí
pûrvî´*h* occurs also X, 46, 10. It may have been, as Geldner believes,
a proverbial locution. But the verb which it is most natural to supply,
seems to be gam (i, yâ), so that the meaning may have been: 'Many
superior (wives) are wont to assemble,' i. e. where one such wife is,
there will be many. This is applied here to the waters, in X, 46, 10 to
such beings as ísha*h*, ûtáya*h* or the like. That ya*s*ás may be meant
for the waters is shown by VII, 36, 6, where the ya*s*ása*h*
vâva*s*ânâ´*h*, mentioned by the side of Sarasvatî, evidently are the
waters.—It should be observed that several expressions of this hymn have
been made use of by the author of X, 46.

Note <span id="an_3:1:11:4">4</span>. Or rather 'in the lap' (upási).
Comp. above, verse 3, note 3.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_3:1:12:1">1</span>. With regard to akrá*h* I adopt the
translation proposed by Geldner (Ved. Studien, I, 168).—On the accent of
mahî´nâm, see Lanman, p. 398.

Note <span id="an_3:1:12:2">2</span>. This seems to be the human
worshipper. I cannot follow Prof. von Roth, Zeitschrift der D. Morg.
Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 118, who explains sûnáve as a corrupt third person
of the verb su.

Note <span id="an_3:1:12:3">3</span>. See above, I, 44, 3, note 1.

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

Note <span id="an_3:1:12:4">4</span>. The dawns.

Note <span id="an_3:1:12:5">5</span>. Comp. above, I, 36, 1, note 2.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_3:1:13:1">1</span>. Vánâ: the wood considered as a
wife.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_3:1:14:1">1</span>. See verse 12, note 3.

##### Verse 18.

Note <span id="an_3:1:18:1">1</span>. The text has vidáthâni.

##### Verse 19.

Note <span id="an_3:1:19:1">1</span>. Comp. Kuhn, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, I,
p. 445.

##### Verse 23.

Note <span id="an_3:1:23:1">1</span>. Í*l*âm. which more especially
means the nourishing substance of the cow. Comp. H. O., Religion des
Veda, 72, 326.—Prof. Max Müller translates: 'Procure to him who implores
thee, O Agni, exuberant land for ever, rich in cows.'
