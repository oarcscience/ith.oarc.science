### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 69.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 13.

1\. Bright, flaming, like the lover of the
Dawn [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:1:1.md), he has, like the light of the sky,
filled the two (worlds of Heaven and Earth) which are turned towards
each other.

2\. As soon as thou wert born thou hast excelled by thy power of mind;
being the son of the gods thou hast become their father.

3\. (Agni is) a worshipper (of the gods), never foolish, (always)
discriminating; (he is) like the udder of the cows; (he is) the
sweetness of food [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:3:1.md)—

4\. Like a kind friend to men, not to be led
astray [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:4:1.md), sitting in the midst, the lovely
one, in the house;

5\. Like a child when born, he is delightful in the house; like a
race-horse which is well cared for [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:5:1.md), he has
wandered across the clans [2](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:5:2.md).

6\. When I call (to the sacrifice) the clans who dwell in the same nest
with the heroes, may Agni then attain all divine
powers [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:6:1.md).

7\. When thou hast listened to these heroes, no one breaks those laws of
thine.

8\. That verily is thy wonderful deed that thou hast
killed [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:8:1), with thy companions, (all foes.md),
that, joined by the heroes, thou hast accomplished thy
works [2](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:8:2.md).

9\. Like the lover of the Dawn [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:9:1.md) resplendent
and bright, of familiar form: may he (thus) pay attention to this
(sacrificer).

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

10\. Carrying (him) they opened by themselves the doors (of heaven).
They all shouted at the aspect of the
sun [1](sbe46019.htm#an_1:69:10:1.md).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:69:1:1">1</span>. The lover of the Dawn is here the
Sun. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 31.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:69:3:1">1</span>. Agni is the sweetness of food
(comp. V, 7, 6. svâ´danam pitûnâ´m); it is not probable that svâ´dma and
û´dha*h* should depend on vi*g*ânán, as Ludwig believes.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:69:4:1">1</span>. I adopt Boehtlingk-Roth's
conjecture ahûryá*h*. Âhû´rya*h* would mean, 'he who is to be led
astray.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:69:5:1">1</span>. See above, 66, 4.

Note <span id="an_1:69:5:2">2</span>. 'He has overcome the (hostile)
clans.' M. M.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:69:6:1">1</span>. Perhaps devatvâ´ is an
instrumental, as Ludwig takes it. In this case we should have to
translate: 'may Agni by his divine power attain everything.'—Prof. Max
Müller translates this verse: 'When I with my men call the clans of the
same nest (the gods), Agni will obtain all divine honours.'

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:69:8:1">1</span>. The first hemistich of this verse
has eleven syllables instead of ten and shows the regular Trish*t*ubh
type. The same irregularity occurs in 70, 4. 10. As I have shown in my
Prolegomena, p. 97, this metrical irregularity does not necessitate
corrections of the text,

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

and the comparison of X, 147, 1 (see next note), where it is said áhan
yát v*ri*trám … vivé*h* apá*h*, seems even to confirm the traditional
reading. It cannot he denied, however, that the double yát and the use
of áhan without an object raises some suspicion. In I, 34, 3; 186, 4 we
have samâné áhan. Possibly we may read, tát tú te dá*m*sa*h* áhan
samâné, 'this wonderful deed of thine has been accomplished on one and
the same day (with that mentioned in verse 7).' I am fully aware of the
uncertainty of such guesses. The removal of yát has already been
proposed by Bollensen (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Gesellschaft,
XXII, 592).

Note <span id="an_1:69:8:2">2</span>. Here we may correct the text with
greater certainty than in the first hemistich, or to speak more
accurately, we shall have to correct not the traditional text itself,
but that ancient grammatical commentary on the text which has been
preserved to us in the Padapâ*th*a. The words vivérápâ*m*si of the
Sa*m*hitâpâ*th*a are written in the Padapâ*th*a vivé*h* rápâ*m*si. Now
we read IV, 19, 10. ápâ*m*si … náryâ áviveshî*h*, 'thou hast performed
manly works.' In X, 147, 1 we have áhan yát v*ri*trám náryam vivé*h*
apá*h*: here the adjective nárya clearly shows that apá*h* is a blunder
for ápa*h*, and we must translate, 'when thou hast killed V*ri*tra and
performed thy manly work.' This passage shows that in X, 76, 3 also
vivé*h* apá*h* should be corrected (v. ápa*h*). Thus we have three
passages in which áviveshî*h* or vivé*h* has the object ápa*h*,
ápâ*m*si, and we may infer with full certainty that in our passage
vivérápâ*m*si does not correspond to a Padapâ*th*a reading vivé*h*
rápâ*m*si but vivé*h* ápâ*m*si. The same may be said with regard to VI,
31, 3 (mushâyá*h* *k*akrám ávive*h* rápâ*m*si; Sa*m*h. ávive rápâ*m*si).

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:69:9:1">1</span>. Comp. above, verse 1.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:69:10:1">1</span>. Comp. above, 66, 10.
