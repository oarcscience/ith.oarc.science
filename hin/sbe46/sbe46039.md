### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 141.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 8–9.

1\. Lo, that beautiful splendour of the god, when he was born of
strength, has truly come to be a wondrous sight. Though he slinks
away [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:1:1.md), the prayer goes straight to
him [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:1:2.md). They have led forward the flowing
streams of *Ri*ta.

2\. The powerful one [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:2:1.md), rich in food, the
true (friend of men) has entered the wondrous
(body) [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:2:2). His second (form of existence.md) is
in the seven kind mothers [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:2:3.md). The ten young
females [4](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:2:4) have brought the third (form.md) of
this bull forth, him the guardian, in order to milk him.

3\. When the rulers, the liberal lords brought him forth by their power
out of the depth, out of the buffalo's
shape [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:3:1.md), when from of
old [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:3:2.md) at the purification of the sweet
drink [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:3:3.md) Mâtari*s*van produces the hidden
one (i. e. Agni) by attrition—

4\. When he is led forward from the highest
father [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:4:1.md), he climbs up the
… [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:4:2), the plants in his (or, in their?.md)
houses. When [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:4:3.md) both (Heaven and Earth or
the two Ara*n*is?) promote his birth, then the youngest one became
bright by his heat [4](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:4:4.md).

5\. Then he entered upon the mothers [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:5:1.md) in
whom he the bright one grew up far and wide
unimpaired [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:5:2.md). When he has climbed up to the
former (mothers) who from of old incite
(him) [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:5:3.md), he runs down in the younger, later
(or, nearer) ones.

6 [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:6:1.md). Then in the strivings for the
day [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:6:2.md) they choose him Hot*ri*. As if to
swell their good fortune they

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

strive towards him [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:6:3.md), when praised by many
he moves everywhere with wisdom and power to the gods and to the praise
of mortals [4](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:6:4) for (bringing them.md) refreshing
drink.

7\. When he has scattered himself, the worshipful one, driven by the
wind, like … [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:7:1.md), with the sound (which he
produces) (?), he whom it is not possible to drive to a place (like
cattle): on the flight of the burning one who speeds on his black way,
whose birth is bright, who strays everywhere to the atmosphere
… [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:7:2.md).

8\. Like a chariot that goes forward, he goes to Heaven with his ruddy
limbs, adorned with his locks of flames [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:8:1.md).
Then his black (clouds of smoke), O burning one (?), the liberal ones
(?) (appear) [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:8:2.md). The birds flee as before
the fierceness of a hero [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:8:3.md).

9\. Through thee indeed, O Agni, Varu*n*a whose laws are firm, Mitra and
Aryaman, the givers of good rain, are glorious, when thou the mighty one
hast been born, everywhere encompassing with wisdom (all beings), as the
felly encompasses the spokes of a wheel.

10\. Thou, O Agni, youngest (god), furtherest treasures and (the
friendship of) the gods for him who performs worship, who presses Soma.
May we thus establish thee the young one, O young (son) of strength,
possessor of great treasures, like the winner in a
race [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:10:1.md).

11\. Make good fortune [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:11:1.md) swell for us like
well-employed wealth belonging to the house, and like firm
ability [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:11:2)—(fortune.md) which can hold both
races [3](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:11:3.md) like reins: and being full-of
good-will in (the sphere of) *Ri*ta, (fill our) praise of the gods (with
rich reward).

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

12\. And may the brilliant, joyful Hot*ri* with quick horses, with a
shining chariot hear us. May he, the wise Agni, lead us on the best
leading (paths) to happy welfare and to bliss.

13\. Agni has been praised with powerful [1](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:13:1.md)
songs, he who has been brought forward furthermore for sovereignty. May
both those our liberal lords and we ourselves spread
out [2](sbe46039.htm#an_1:141:13:2) (our power over all foes.md) as the sun
(spreads out its light and by it destroys) the mist.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is *G*agatî; the two last verses again are
Trish*t*ubh.—None of its verses occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:141:1:1">1</span>. The meaning seems to be that if
Agni be unwilling to officiate at the sacrifice, the prayer nevertheless
reaches its aim and induces him to do his duty as the divine Hot*ri*.

Note <span id="an_1:141:1:2">2</span>. The verb sâdh is very frequently
connected with substantives such as dhíya*h* or the like. Comp. also
matînâ´m *k*a sâ´dhanam, X, 26, 4.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:141:2:1">1</span>. It seems probable that
p*ri*kshá*h* is the nominative of p*ri*kshá, and not the genitive of
p*ri*ksh. Comp. VI, 8, 1, where it is said of Agni 'p*ri*kshásya
v*rí*sh*n*a*h* arushásya.' On the meaning of p*ri*kshá, see above, I,
127, 5, note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:141:2:2">2</span>. The poet seems clearly to
describe the second and third form of Agni's existence, his dwelling in
the waters and his birth from the fire-sticks. But he is less explicit
with regard to the first form. The epithet pitumâ´n

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

would seem to point to Agni as the sacrificial fire and the receiver of
offerings. But it is rather strange that this form of the god should be
distinguished from the Agni procreated by the ten females, i. e.
produced by the ten fingers, by the attrition of the
kindling-sticks.—Prof. Max Müller differs from me in referring the words
dá*s*apramatim *g*anayanta yósha*n*a*h*, not to the third form of Agni,
but to Agni in general. He translates: 'The powerful one, rich in food,
rests always on that wondrous sight (Agni on the altar, gârhapatya
Agni). The second rests in the seven kind mothers (vidyudrûpa; Agni in
the clouds); the third is for milking the powerful one (Agni as the sun,
âdityarûpa)—the ten maidens (the fingers) have brought forth the
guardian.'

Note <span id="an_1:141:2:3">3</span>. Grassmann no doubt is right in
proposing to read saptá *s*ivâ´su. Of course the waters are alluded to.

Note <span id="an_1:141:2:4">4</span>. Read dá*s*a prámatim
(Boehtlingk-Roth). On Agni as the son of the ten fingers, comp.
Bergaigne, II, 7.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:141:3:1">1</span>. The buffalo Agni was hidden in
the depth. Comp. X, 8, 1. apâ´m upá-sthe mahishá*h* vavardha; I, 95, 9.
budhnám vi-ró*k*amânam mahishásya dhâ´ma.

Note <span id="an_1:141:3:2">2</span>. The preposition ánu seems to
stand here with an ablative (pra-díva*h*).

Note <span id="an_1:141:3:3">3</span>. The literal meaning of mádhva*h*
â-dhavé is indicated by passages such as I, 109, 4. â´ dhâvatam mádhunâ;
IX, 11, 5. mádhâv â´ dhâvata mádhu. Comp. also âdhavanîya. On the
washing of the Soma which is technically designated by the verb â-dhâv,
see H. O., Göttinger Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1890, p. 426 seq.; Hillebrandt,
Vedische Mythologie, I, 216.—The purification of the sweet drink, at
which Agni is produced, was probably achieved by the tempest.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:141:4:1">1</span>. The highest father is Heaven.

Note <span id="an_1:141:4:2">2</span>. The meaning of p*ri*kshúdha*h* is
unknown.

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

Note <span id="an_1:141:4:3">3</span>. Yát is repeated twice, as yásya
in X, 121, 2. yásya ví*s*ve upa-â´sate pra-*s*ísham yásya devâ´*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:141:4:4">4</span>. On gh*rin*â´, comp. Lanman,
Noun-Inflection, 335.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:141:5:1">1</span>. The mothers are the Waters.

Note <span id="an_1:141:5:2">2</span>. The reading, very probably, ought
to be vivâv*ri*dhé.

Note <span id="an_1:141:5:3">3</span>. Boehtlingk-Roth believe that the
reading ought to be sanâyúva*h* or sanâ-*g*úra*h*. Sanâ-*g*úra*h* (cf.
sanâ-*g*úrâ pitárâ, IV, 36, 3) seems to me quite possible, although
there is no positive necessity for abandoning the traditional
reading.—The 'former' mothers may be the heavenly Waters; the mothers in
whom Agni runs down are the rivers. Prof. Max Müller adds that the
former mothers may possibly be 'the burnt pieces of wood. Agni runs up
in them, then leaves them to burn new pieces.'

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:141:6:1">1</span>. On the whole verse, compare
Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 217.

Note <span id="an_1:141:6:2">2</span>. Comp. above, I, 45, 7, note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:141:6:3">3</span>. The second Pâda is translated by
Pischel: 'Wie in einen König drängen sie in ihn, wenn sie (Trank)opfer
darbringen.' But verse 11 shows that bhágam depends on
pap*rik*ânâ´sa*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:141:6:4">4</span>. Comp. III, 16, 4. â´ devéshu … â´
*s*á*m*se utá n*rin*â´m.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:141:7:1">1</span>. The translation of hvârá*h* is
quite uncertain. The same must be said of the rest of this Pâda.

Note <span id="an_1:141:7:2">2</span>. The sentence is incomplete.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:141:8:1">1</span>. On *s*íkvan (or *s*íkvas), comp.
M. M.’s note, vol. xxxii, p. 318; Hübschmann, Vocalsystem, p. 186. The
translation is only tentative.—Two syllables are wanting;

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

we may propose a reading like *s*íkvabhi*h* párishk*ri*ta*h* (comp.
H. O., Prolegomena, 76, note 3).

Note <span id="an_1:141:8:2">2</span>. This passage is most obscure. The
first words of the Pâda are the same as above, 140, 5. The 'black ones'
probably are the dark clouds of smoke that surround Agni. But it is very
strange that these clouds should be designated as sûráya*h*, 'liberal
ones.' And the vocative (?) dakshi (Padapâ*th*a dhakshi), instead of
which we should at least expect daksho or dakshin, is no less strange.
The text seems thoroughly corrupt.

Note <span id="an_1:141:8:3">3</span>. See Lanman, p. 557.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:141:10:1">1</span>. Comp. Geldner, Vedische Studien,
I, 121.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_1:141:11:1">1</span>. Comp. above, verse 6, Pâda 2.

Note <span id="an_1:141:11:2">2</span>. Comp. VIII, 24, 14. dáksham
p*riñk*ántam.

Note <span id="an_1:141:11:3">3</span>. The human and the divine race. I
do not believe that Dr. Neisser (Zur Vedischen Verballehre, 17) is right
in interpreting yámati as an indicative.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_1:141:13:1">1</span>. The translation of
*s*ímîvadbhi*h* is only tentative. *S*ímî (I, 151, 1) cannot be
identical with *s*ámî.

Note <span id="an_1:141:13:2">2</span>. Ní*h* tatanyu*h* (nísh
*t*atanyu*h*, Sa*m*hitâpâ*th*a) of course is derived from tan, not from
stan. Comp. I, 105, 12. satyám tâtâna sû´rya*h*; IV, 5, 13. sû´ra*h*
vár*n*ena tatanan ushâ´sa*h*, &c.
