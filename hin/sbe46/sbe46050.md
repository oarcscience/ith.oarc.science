### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 189.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 10–11.

1\. Agni! Lead us to wealth on a good path, O god who knowest all rules.
Drive away from us sin which leads us astray. We will offer to thee the
fullest praise.

2\. Agni! Thou who art young, help us safely across all difficulties. Be
for us a broad, large, wide stronghold, for our kith and kin, with luck
and weal [1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:2:1).

3\. Agni! Drive away from us all plagues. (Then) they shall
plague [1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:3:1) peoples who do not stand under
Agni's protection. (Give) us back again the earth, O god, together with
all the immortals, O worshipful one, that it may go well with us.

4\. Protect us, Agni, with thy unwearied guardians, thou who flamest in
thy beloved seat. May no danger, O youngest of the gods, attain thy
praiser, not now nor in future, O mighty one!

5\. Do not deliver us, O Agni, to the harmful foe, to the greedy one, to
the impostor, to misfortune. Do not surrender us, O mighty one, to one
who has teeth, who bites, nor to one who has no teeth, nor to one who
will hurt us.

6\. May a (god) like thee, O Agni, who art born according to *Ri*ta,
being praised spread out a shelter for the body (of the worshipper that
protects) from every one who tries to harm or to revile him. For thou, O
god, art a descrier [1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:6:1) of everything that
leads us astray.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

7 [1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:1). Thou, O Agni, distinguishing both
(kinds of men, the pious and the impious, or the Aryans and the
Dasyus [2](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:2)), eagerly approachest (Aryan) men
at (the time of) the advancing (day) [3](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:3), O
worshipful one. At (the time of) rest thou hast become governable to the
man (or, to Manu; or, thou art to be praised by
men [4](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:4)); thou art to be smoothed down like a
horse [5](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:7:5) by the U*s*i*g*s.

8\. We have pronounced our invocations, I the son of
Mâna [1](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:8:1), before this mighty Agni. May we
obtain (our wishes) through a thousand *Ri*shis. May we find a
food-giving … rich in quickening rain [2](sbe46050.htm#an_1:189:8:2).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 1 = VS. V, 36; VII, 43; XL,
16; TS. I, 1, 14, 3; 4, 43, 1; TB. II, 8, 2, 3; TÂ. I, 8, 8; MS. I, 2,
13; IV, 10, 2; 14, 3. Verse 2 = TS. I, 1, 14, 4; TB. II, 8, 2, 5; TÂ. X,
2, 1; MS. IV, 10, 1; 14, 3. Verse 3 = TB. II, 8, 2, 4; MS. IV, 14, 3.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:189:2:1">1</span>. 'For health and wealth,' M. M.;
see vol. xxxii, p. 193.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:189:3:1">1</span>. If the accent is correct (Sa*m*h.
abhyámanta, Pad. abhí ámanta), the clause, though containing no
subordinating word, must be understood as standing in logical dependence
on the following, or—which in our case seems more probable—on the
preceding clause. Examples of this kind have been collected by Delbrück,
Altindische

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Syntax, p.
43.—That k*ri*sh*t*î´*h* should be nominative is very improbable; comp.
Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 393. See also Leo Meyer, Kuhn's Zeitschrift,
XVI, 9.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:189:6:1">1</span>. Prof. Max Müller (vol. xxxii, p.
229) translates, 'For thou, god, art the deliverer from all assaults;'
he derives vishpá*t* 'from vi and spa*s*, to bind.'

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:189:7:1">1</span>. This verse has been treated of by
Geldner, Vedische Studien, II, 156, 158.

Note <span id="an_1:189:7:2">2</span>. Geldner (loc. cit., 156) proposes
two explanations for ubháyân. It may refer either to the pious and the
impious spoken of in the preceding verses, or to prapitvám and
abhipitvám, which words Geldner believes to be masculine. I do not
attach such weight to the Avestic frapithwô (Vend. III, 3) as to draw,
with Geldner, a conclusion from this word on the gender of the Vedic
prapitvá, and in every case I think that this explanation of ubháyân is
very forced, while it is natural to refer ubháyân to the pious and
impious, or as we may express it in conformity with Vedic ideas, to
'men' (comp. mánusha*h* Pâda 2, mánave Pâda 3), i. e. Aryans, and Dasyus
(see VIII, 50, 8; 98, 6; IX, 92, 5). Then ubháyân ví vidvân would have
exactly the sane meaning as the words in I, 51, 8. ví *g*ânîhi â´ryân yé
*k*a dásyava*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:189:7:3">3</span>. On prapitvá we have the two
ingenious discussions of Geldner, Vedische Studien, II, 155 seq., and of
Bloomfield in the fifth series of his Contributions to the
interpretation of the Veda, p. 24 seq. In my opinion Bloomfield has not
succeeded in proving that the words ending in -pitvá (prapitvá,
abhipitvá, sapitvá, &c.) contain the stem pith, 'sap, drink,
nourishment,' and that prapitvá means the morning-pressure of Soma,
which is usually designated as prâta*h*savana, abhipitvá, the
evening-pressure or the t*ri*tîya-savana. I do not think it necessary,
however,

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

to examine here the single points of his interesting and elaborate
discussion, for it seems to me that Geldner has conclusively shown that
the meaning of these words is different from what Bloomfield believes it
to be: abhipitvá, as Geldner (p. 155) states, is 'Erholung,' 'Rast,' and
'die Zeit des Rastens,' 'Feierabend,' 'Abend;' prapitvá (p. 178), on the
other hand. means 'Vorlauf,' 'das aufs Ziel Zugehen,' die vorgerückte
Tageszeit.'

Note <span id="an_1:189:7:4">4</span>. *S*â´sya*h*, 'governable,' does
not give an impossible meaning. But should we not have to correct
*s*á*m*sya*h* 'thou art to be praised by men?'

Note <span id="an_1:189:7:5">5</span>. On akrá*h*, comp. Vedische
Studien, I, 168, and above, I, 143, 7.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:189:8:1">1</span>. Mâna is another name of Agastya.
See Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XLII, 221.

Note <span id="an_1:189:8:2">2</span>. On the last words of the hymn—the
regularly repeated conclusion of the Agastya hymns—see M. M., vol.
xxxii, p. xx, and also Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 212. I
do not think it very probable that ishá is here the name of an autumn
month, as found iii the *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a and others of the more
modern Vedic texts; to me it would seem rather strange that such a
prayer for the fertility of that month should have formed, among the
Agastyas, the standing conclusion of their sacrificial hymns. But the
names of the two months ishá and ûr*g*á seem to point to the existence
of two adjectives meaning 'giving food' and 'giving sap.'—Then follows
v*rig*ána, used as a masculine. Geldner (Vedische Studien, I, 151)
indicates the following passages, in which he believes that this
masculine v*rig*ána occurs: V, 44, 1; VI, 35, 5; VII, 32, 27; X, 27, 4;
and the concluding Pâda of the Agastya hymns. Of these passages the two
first seem to be open to doubt as to the correctness of the text. In V,
44, 1 the true reading may be pratî*k*înám v*rí*sha*n*am dohase; comp.
verse 3, v*rí*shâ *s*í*s*u*h*, and I, 173, 6, where possibly
v*rí*sha*n*am should be read instead of v*rig*ánam (Göttinger

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gelehrte Anzeigen,
1890, 417). In VI, 35, 5 I propose to read v*rin*a*g*am (Gött. Gel.
Anzeigen, loc. cit., 416). In VII, 32, 27 and X, 27, 4 v*rig*ánâ (Padap.
v*rig*ánâ*h*; the letter d follows) and v*rig*áneshu seem to be
masculine, though it is not absolutely impossible to see in these forms
the nom. plur. and loc. plur. of the neuter v*rig*ána. But I believe
that any attempts to derive conclusions from these three passages on the
meaning of the masculine v*rig*ána are hopeless.
