### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 6.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 22–23.

1\. I think of that Agni who is a Vasu, to whom the milch-cows go home,
the swift horses (go) home, (our) own racers (go) home. Bring food to
thy praisers!

2\. He is Agni who is praised as the Vasu, he to whom the milch-cows
come together, and the quickly running horses, and the well-born liberal
patrons. Bring food to thy praisers!

3\. For Agni, dwelling among all tribes, gives a racer to the clan. Agni
(gives a racer) that is truly helpful for (winning)
wealth [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:3:1): he (the racer.md) being well
cherished, will attain precious gain. Bring food to thy praisers!

4\. May we kindle thee [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:4:1.md), Agni, O god, the
brilliant, never ageing, in order that yon highly miraculous fuel of
thine [2](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:4:2.md) may shine in the sky. Bring food to
thy praisers!

5\. To thee [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:5:1.md), O Agni, our oblation is
offered with a *Rik*, O lord of bright splendour, highly brilliant,
wonderful lord of the clan, carrier of oblations! Bring food to thy
praisers!

6\. Those Agnis make everything precious prosper in the Agnis; they
drive forward (precious wealth); they incite it; they speed it hither in
the due way [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:6:1.md). Bring food to thy praisers!

7\. Those flames of thine, O Agni, the racers, have boasted
mightily—they who with the flight of their

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

hoofs have made tremble [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:7:1.md) the stables of the
cows. Bring food to thy praisers!

8\. Bring fresh food with fine dwellings, O Agni, to us, thy praisers!
May we be of those who have praised (thee), who have thee as their
messenger, house by house. Bring food to thy praisers!

9\. Thou warmest in thy mouth, O highly brilliant one, the two
(sacrificial) ladles full of butter. And mayst thou fill us (with gifts)
at our hymns, O lord of strength! Bring food to thy praisers!

10\. Thus [1](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:10:1.md) they have driven, they have
led [2](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:10:2.md), Agni in the due way by prayers and
sacrifices. May he bestow on us plenty of valiant men, and that plenty
of swift horses (wished for) [3](sbe46110.htm#an_5:6:10:3.md). Bring food
to thy praisers!

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is Paṅkti.—Verse 1 = SV. I, 425. Verses 1–2
= VS. XV, 41, 42; MS. II, 13, 7. Verses 1, 3, 2 = SV. II, 1087–1089.
Verse 3 = TB. III, 11, 6, 4. Verse 4 = SV. I, 419; AV. XVIII, 4, 88; MS.
II, 13, 7. Verses 4, 5, 9 = SV. II, 372–374; TS. IV, 4, 4, 6. Verse 9 =
VS. XV, 43; TS. II, 2, 12, 7.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:6:3:1">1</span>. At first sight the conjecture of
Böhtlingk-Roth and Grassmann, rayím, is very tempting, cf. IX, 12, 9.
rayím … su-âbhúvam; X, 122, 3. rayí*n*â … su-âbúvâ. I believe,
nevertheless, that on closer examination the traditional text will prove
correct. Sá prîtá*h* evidently refers to the racer (vâ*g*ín) cf. I, 66,
4 = 69, 5. vâ*g*î´ ná prîtá*h* (cf. also X, 101, 7. prî*n*îtá á*s*vân):
then it follows that su-âbhúvam also refers to the racer, and râyé (cf.
I, 100, 16; III, 53, 16) will be quite right.

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:6:4:1">1</span>. Te stands for the accusative; see
Pischel, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländ. Gesellschaft, XXXV, 715;
Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 205.

Note <span id="an_5:6:4:2">2</span>. This refers to the sun. By kindling
the sacred fire men make the sun rise. See H. O., Religion des Veda, p.
110.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:6:5:1">1</span>. The pronoun 'to thee' stands twice,
to in the first Pâda (where it is repeated from the first Pâda of verse
4, â´ te agne), and túbhyam (or rather túbhya) in the fourth Pâda,
unless we construe to havi*h*.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_5:6:6:1">1</span>. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, II,
127.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_5:6:7:1">1</span>. See Gaedicke, Der Accusativ, p. 57.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_5:6:10:1">1</span>. On the nasalization of evâ´n̐, cf.
H. O., Prolegomena, p. 469 seq.

Note <span id="an_5:6:10:2">2</span>. Pischel (Vedische Studien, II,
127) explains a*g*u*h* as a*g*ush, the contrary of sa*g*û´sh.
Bartholomae (Studien zur Indogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, II, 159,
note 2; cf. Indogermanische Forschungen, III, 108, note I) conjectures
á*g*ur (= á*g*man) yamu*h*: 'sie haben ihn jetzt auf seiner Bahn
festgehalten.' I believe, as Sâya*n*a does, that this a*g*uryamu*h*
contains two independent verbs, a*g*u*h* and yamu*h*, which are quite
correct forms of the roots a*g* and yam (see Delbrück, Altindisches
Verbum, p. 65). As to a*g*, cf. VI, 2, 8. a*g*yáse ágne vâ*g*î´ ná; V,
30, 14. átya*h* ná vâ*g*î´ raghú*h* a*g*yámâna*h*; as to yam II, 5, 1.
*s*akéma vâ*g*ína*h* (i. e. agné*h*) yámam. But should not the accent be
yamú*h*?

Note <span id="an_5:6:10:3">3</span>. The fourth Pâda is identical with
VIII, 6, 24.
