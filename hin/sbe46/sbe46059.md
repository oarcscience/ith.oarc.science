### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 9.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 6, VARGA 1.

1\. The Hot*ri* who is found on the Hot*ri*'s seat has sat down (there),
the fierce, the resplendent, the dexterous one, the protector of (his
own) infallible laws [1](sbe46059.htm#an_2:9:1:1.md), the highest Vasu, he
who brings thousandfold (gain), the pure-tongued Agni.

2\. Be thou our messenger, be our protector far and wide; be thou, O
bull, a leader towards greater wealth. O Agni! for the continuation of
our children and of ourselves be thou an unremitting, brilliant
protector.

3\. May we worship thee at thy highest birth (-place), O Agni; may we
worship thee with praises in thy lower abode. I honour the womb from
which thou hast sprung. When thou hast been kindled, they have offered
offerings in thee.

4\. Agni, being the best sacrificer perform thou the sacrifice with the
oblation. With thy readiness to hear (us) hail our gift, the wealth
(which we offer). For thou art the treasure-lord of treasures; thou art
the deviser of brilliant speech.

5\. Thy wealth of both kinds [1](sbe46059.htm#an_2:9:5:1.md) never fails,
when thou art born (kindled) day by day, "O wonderful one. Make thy
singer, O Agni, rich in food; make him the lord of wealth with excellent
offspring.

6\. With this face of thine, as a bounteous (lord), a sacrificer to the
gods, the best performer of sacrifices with happiness, as an
undeceivable guardian and far-reaching protector, shine among us, O
Agni, with light and wealth.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Trish*t*ubh.—According to an observation of
Bergaigne's, hymns of six verses composed in Trish*t*ubh should precede
hymns of the same extent composed in Gâyatrî. Though this law is not
without exceptions (see H. O., Die Hymnen des Rigveda, I, 202 seq.), the
suspicion is raised that the hymns 9 and 10 should each be divided into
two T*rik*as.—Verse 1 = VS. XI, 36; TS. III, 3, 11, 2; IV, 1, 3, 3; MS.
II, 7, 3. Verse 2 = TS. III, 5, 11, 2; MS. IV, 10, 4. Verse 3 = VS.
XVII, 75; TS. IV, 6, 5, 4; MS. II, 10, 6. Verse 6 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 2;
MS. IV, 10, 5.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:9:1:1">1</span>. The long compound looks suspicious;
possibly it should be read ádabdhavrata*h* prámati*h*.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:9:5:1">1</span>. Vásu and dhána frequently receive
the epithet ubhâya; see VI, 19, 10; VII, 82, 4; 83, 5; X, 84, 7. No
doubt celestial and terrestrial goods are referred to, see II, 14, 11;
V, 68, 3; VI, 59, 9; VII, 97, 10; IX, 19, 1; 100, 3.
