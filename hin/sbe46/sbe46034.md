### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 98.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 7, VARGA 6.

1\. May we dwell in the favour of (Agni) Vai*s*vânara. He indeed is a
king, leading all beings to gloriousness [1](sbe46034.htm#an_1:98:1:1).
As soon as born from here he looks over this whole world. Vai*s*vânara
unites with the Sun [2](sbe46034.htm#an_1:98:1:2).

2\. Agni who has been looked and longed
for [1](sbe46034.htm#an_1:98:2:1) in Heaven, who has been looked for on
Earth—he who has been looked for, has entered all herbs. May Agni
Vai*s*vânara, who has strongly been looked for, protect us from harm by
day and by night.

3\. Vai*s*vânara! May this be true of thee: may wealth and liberal
givers attend us! May Mitra and Varu*n*a grant us this, may Aditi, the
Sindhu, the Earth, and the Sky!

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 1 = VS. XXVI, 7; TS. I, 5,
11, 3; MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 2 = VS. XVIII, 73; TS. I, 5, 11, 1; IV, 4,
12, 5; 7, 15, 6; TB. III, 11, 6, 4; MS. II, 13, 11.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:98:1:1">1</span>. Comp. VI, 70, 1. bhúvanânâm
abhi*s*ríyâ. Abhi*s*rî´ seems to mean, going or leading towards (abhí)
gloriousness (*s*rî´). Prof. Pischel's opinion on the word is different;
see Vedische Studien, I, 53 seq.

Note <span id="an_1:98:1:2">2</span>. As to yatate, comp. V, 4, 4,
yátamâna*h* ra*s*míbhi*h* sû´ryasya; IX, 111, 3. sám ra*s*míbhi*h*
yatate dar*s*atá*h* rátha*h*.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:98:2:1">1</span>. On the disappearance of Agni who
is looked for everywhere, see M. M., Physical Religion, 254 seq.;
Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, II, 75.
