### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 7.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 1–2.

1\. They who have risen out of the drink of the white-backed one, have
entered the two parents, the seven sounds. The (all-)encompassing
parents come together; they go forth to aspire after long
life [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:1:1.md).

2\. The milch-cows dwelling in heaven [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:2:1.md) are
the mares of the manly one. He has bestridden the goddesses who carry
the sweet (food) [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:2:2.md). Thee who livest in peace
in the abode of *Ri*ta, the one cow [3](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:2:3.md)
circumambulates, making her way.

3\. He has mounted the (mares) [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:3:1.md) that became
well-manageable, the wise lord, the finder of riches. He with the dark
blue back, with many faces, has made them depart from the drink of the
brush-wood [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:3:2.md).

4\. Giving mighty vigour to the never-ageing son of
Tvash*tri* [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:4:1.md), the
streams [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:4:2.md) carry Him the firmly fixed one.
Flashing in his abode with his limbs he has entered upon the two worlds
as if they were one.

5\. They know friendship towards the manly, the red one, and they
delight in the command of ruddy (Agni), (the gods) shining from heaven,
resplendent with bright shine, to whose host I*l*â belongs, the mighty
praise.

6\. And finding it out by following the noise they brought to the great
one's great parents a song of praise, when the bull about nightfall (?)
has grown strong according to the singer's own
law [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:6:1.md).

<span id="page_249">p. "9"</span>

7\. With the five Adhvaryus the seven priests watch the beloved footstep
which the bird has made [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:7:1.md). Turned forwards
the never-ageing bulls [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:7:2.md) rejoice: for they,
being gods, have followed the laws of the gods.

8 = III, 4, 7.

9\. The many (mares) are full of desire for the mighty stallion. For the
manly, bright one, the reins easily direct (the
horses) [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:9:1.md). Divine Hot*ri*! Thou who art a
great joy-giver and wise, bring hither the great gods and the two
worlds [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:9:2.md).

10\. The dawns, O wealth-giver, the mighty
sacrificers [1](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:10:1.md), well spoken and bright have
shone with wealth. And by the earth's
greatness [2](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:10:2.md), O Agni, forgive us even
committed sin [3](sbe46067.htm#an_3:7:10:3.md), that we may be great.

11 = III, 1, 23.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—No verse of this hymn occurs in the other
Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:7:1:1">1</span>. On the meaning of this difficult
verse conjectures only can be given. The white-backed one may be Agni.
If this is right, 'they who have risen out of Agni's drink,' may be
Agni's rays or flames (ye ra*s*maya*h* … prakarshe*n*odga*kkh*anti,
Sâya*n*a); these flames enter upon the two mothers, i. e. Heaven and
Earth, and upon the seven sounds, the sacrificial songs which are
identified with the terrestrial and celestial seven rivers (comp. above,
III, 1, 6). All this rests on the supposition that the traditional text
is correct. Now Ludwig remarks with reference

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

to the pronoun yé: 'Warscheinlicher ist, dass wir hier eine
archaistische anwendung der form auf e für fem. vor uns haben,' and
Griffith says that yé is 'apparently used for the feminine.' I do not
believe in this possibility, but for yé (yá) the true reading may be
yâ´(*h*). In this case the seven vâ*n*îs would be subject: 'They who
have risen out of the drink of the white-backed one, the seven sounds
have entered the two parents.' The meaning of this may be: The
sacrificial songs, rising as it were out of the offering made to Agni,
and in the same way the streams of water which, in the shape of clouds
of smoke rise out of the offering (comp. I, 164, 51), have gone to
Heaven and Earth.

That the parents in the third Pâda are again Heaven and Earth is shown
by X, 65, 8. parikshítâ pitárâ … dyâ´vâp*ri*thivî´. It may be observed
that the author of X, 65 (see especially the verses 6–8) evidently
imitated the expressions of the hymn, III, 7. 'The coming together of
Heaven and Earth marks the beginning of the day and of the year.' M. M.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:7:2:1">1</span>. On divákshas, comp. Joh. Schmidt,
Pluralbildungen der Neutra, 417 seq.

Note <span id="an_3:7:2:2">2</span>. The milch-cows, mares, or goddesses
seem to be the celestial waters or Dawns.

Note <span id="an_3:7:2:3">3</span>. Comp. X, 65, 6, quoted at the end
of this note. Is the cow (Vâ*k*, according to Sâya*n*a) the Dawn which
daily returns in her due way? Or the butter offered to Agni? In our
verse and in the parallel passage, X, 65, 6, the vartaní of the cow is
mentioned; it may be observed that the vartaní of Ushas is referred to
in X, 172, 1. 4. And Ushas is represented in I, 123, 9 as coming to the
nishk*ri*tá: comp. X, 65, 6. yâ´ gaú*h* vartaním pari-éti
ni*h*-k*ri*tám.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:7:3:1">1</span>. See verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:7:3:2">2</span>. The meaning may possibly be the
following. The Waters dwell in the plants as their sap (comp. H. O.,

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Religion des Veda,
113). Agni, when burning or drinking as it were, the brushwood, destroys
this dwelling of the Waters; he makes the Waters depart from the wood.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:7:4:1">1</span>. On Agni as the son of Tvash*tri*,
see Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, I, 522 seq.

Note <span id="an_3:7:4:2">2</span>. 'Could vaháta*h* be the suyámâ*h*
of verse 3?' M. M.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:7:6:1">1</span>. Or, 'when the singer's bull … has
grown strong according to his own law'? The bull, of course, is Agni.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:7:7:1">1</span>. See above, 5, 5. 6.

Note <span id="an_3:7:7:2">2</span>. The flames of Agni?

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_3:7:9:1">1</span>. Ra*s*máya*h*, 'the reins,' at the
same time means 'the rays' (of Agni). Suyâmâ´*h* being an apposition to
ra*s*máya*h*, one is tempted to derive it from the root yam, 'to
direct,' but it may contain the word yâ´ma, 'the way,' and mean 'having
a good way.'—It is difficult to believe that ra*s*máya*h* suyâmâ´*h* is
a second subject of v*ri*shâyánte, in which case the translation would
be: 'The many (mares) are desirous of the mighty stallion, the … reins
(or rays) of the manly, bright one.'

Note <span id="an_3:7:9:2">2</span>. 'Bring hither to the two worlds the
great gods.' M. M.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_3:7:10:1">1</span>. On p*ri*kshá-praya*g*a*h*, comp.
M. M., val. xxxii, p. 335; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 98.

Note <span id="an_3:7:10:2">2</span>. The meaning seems to be: By thy
greatness which is equal to that of the earth.

Note <span id="an_3:7:10:3">3</span>. Comp. X, 63, 8. k*ri*tâ´t
ák*ri*tât énasa*h*. See also I, 24, 9; VI, 51, 8.
