### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 10.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 6, VARGA 2.

1\. Agni is to be invoked as the first like a father, when he has been
inflamed by Manus [1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:1:1) in the abode of
I*d* [2](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:1:2). When he has invested himself with
beauty, the wise immortal, he, the glorious strong (horse) is to be
smoothed (by the worshippers as by grooms).

2\. Agni with bright splendour, mayest thou hear my call with all my
prayers, thou a wise immortal. The two tawny (horses) draw thy chariot
or the two red (horses), or He the wide-ranging one has made the two
ruddy (horses draw his chariot) [1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:2:1).

3\. They have generated the well-born (Agni) in her who lies on her
back [1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:1). Agni became a germ in the
manifoldly-adorned (wives) [2](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:2). Even in the
… [3](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:3) the wise one dwells by night uncovered
in his powers [4](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:4).

4\. I besprinkle with my offering, with Gh*ri*ta, Agni who abides turned
towards all beings, who widely extends throughout, who is mighty in his
vigour, who shows himself most capacious by the food (which he
consumes), and robust [1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:4:1).

5\. I besprinkle Him who is turned towards (us) from all sides; may he
gladly accept that with his benevolent mind. Agni, who is like a
beautiful youth, who has the appearance of one eagerly striving, is not
to be touched, when he hurries around with his body.

6\. Mayst thou know the portion (belonging to thee), being strong
through thy desire. With thee as our messenger may we speak like Manu.
Gaining

wealth [1](sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:6:1) I invoke with my (sacrificial)
ladle, with my eloquence, the faultless Agni who mixes the honey-drink.

### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre. On the position of this hymn in the
collection and its division into T*rik*as, see the note on II, 9.—Verses
4–5 = VS. XI, 23–24; TS. IV, 1, 2, 4. 5; MS. II, 7, 2.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:10:1:1">1</span>. Comp. VII, 2, 3. Mánunâ sámiddham.

Note <span id="an_2:10:1:2">2</span>. Í*d* is a synonym of í*d*â;
i*l*á*h* padé means the same as í*l*âyâ*h* padé.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_2:10:2:1">1</span>. I cannot accept Prof. Lanman's
scansion of this Pâda (Noun-Inflection, 342), utá arushâ´ha *k*akre
víbh*ri*tra*h*. In my opinion the only reading in conformity with the
use of Vedic poets is utâ´rushâ´ áha, &c.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_2:10:3:1">1</span>. Comp. III, 29, 3 (see below). Of
course the kindling-stick is alluded to.

Note <span id="an_2:10:3:2">2</span>. The wives are the plants.—Comp.
Lanman, p. 548.

Note <span id="an_2:10:3:3">3</span>. The meaning of *s*íri*n*â (ἅπαξ
λεγόμενον) is unknown. The Indian explanation ('night') of course is a
guess, but this guess may be right.

Note <span id="an_2:10:3:4">4</span>. 'Uncovered by the night,' M. M. On
máhobhi*h*, cf. vol. xxxii, p. 197.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_2:10:4:1">1</span>. See vol. xxxii, p. 212.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_2:10:6:1">1</span>. There is no reason for
conjecturing dhanasâ´m (Ludwig). Comp. X, 65, 10. indriyám sómam
dhanasâ´*h* u îmahe.
