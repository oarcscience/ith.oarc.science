### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 45.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 31–32.

1\. Sacrifice here, thou, O Agni, to the Vasus, the Rudras, and the
Âdityas, to the (divine) host that receives good
sacrifices [1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:1:1.md), the Gh*ri*ta-sprinkling
offspring of Manu [2](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:1:2.md).

2\. The wise gods, O Agni, are ready to listen to the worshippers:
conduct them hither, the thirty-three, O lord of red horses, thou who
lovest our praises.

3\. As thou hast heard Priyamedha and
Atri [1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:3:1.md), O *G*âtavedas, as thou hast heard
Virûpa and Aṅgiras, thus hear the invocation of Praska*n*va, O lord of
high laws.

4\. The Mahikerus [1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:4:1.md), the Priyamedhas have
invoked for their protection the lord of worship, Agni with his bright
splendour.

5\. O thou to whom Gh*ri*ta oblations are poured out, good (Agni), hear
these praises with which the sons of Ka*n*va invoke thee for their
protection.

6\. O Agni, whose glory is brightest, beloved of many, the people in the
clans invoke thee, the radiant-haired, to convey the sacrificial food.

7\. The priests have established thee, O Agni, in the striving for
day [1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:7:1.md), as their Hot*ri*, the ministrant, the
greatest acquirer of wealth, with attentive ears, the most widely
extended [2](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:7:2.md).

8\. The wise who have pressed Soma have made thee speed hither to the
feast (which is offered to the gods), bringing great
light [1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:8:1.md) and sacrificial food, O Agni, on
behalf of the mortal worshipper.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

9\. O strength-made, good (Agni), make the gods who come in the morning,
the divine host, sit down here to-day on our sacrificial grass, O Vasu,
to drink the Soma.

10\. Sacrifice, O Agni, with joint invocations, and bring hither the
divine host. This is the Soma, O rain-giving gods. Drink (the Soma)
which has been kept over night [1](sbe46011.htm#an_1:45:10:1.md).

#### NOTES.

The hymn is ascribed to Praska*n*va. It is evidently addressed to Agni
in his matutinal character; comp. the note on I, 44. The metre is
Anush*t*ubh. Verse 1 = SV. I, 96. Verse 6 = VS. XV, 31; TS. IV, 4, 4, 3;
MS. II, 13, 7.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:45:1:1">1</span>. Comp. VIII, 5, 33. á*kkh*a
svadhvarám *g*ánam.

Note <span id="an_1:45:1:2">2</span>. As to the gods being considered
here as offspring of Manu, comp. especially X, 53, 6. mánu*h* bhava
*g*anáya daívyam *g*ánam, 'become Manu, procreate the divine hosts.' See
also Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, I, 69.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:45:3:1">1</span>. This passage is one of those which
show that the Atris stood in especially friendly connection with the
Ka*n*vas. Of the Priyamedhas the same may be said, or perhaps we may
even go further and consider them as one branch of the Ka*n*vas. For a
fuller discussion of these questions I refer to my paper, 'Ueber die
Liedverfasser des Rig-veda,' Zeitschr. der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLII,
213 seq.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:45:4:1">1</span>. Máhikerava*h*, which I have
translated as a proper name, may be an adjective belonging to
Priyámedhâ*h*. Possibly it is derived from the root kar, 'to praise:'
'the

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Priyamedhas with
mighty hymns.' Comp. Bartholomae, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 341.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:45:7:1">1</span>. As gó-ish*t*i means 'the striving
for cows,' thus dív-ish*t*i means 'the striving for day,' or possibly
'the striving for heaven.' Ludwig (III, 383) takes it for 'morgenopfer,'
and it is true that most of the passages, in which the word occurs, are
addressed to matutinal deities. Thus our passage belongs to a hymn
addressed to the matutinal Agni; I, 48, 9 is addressed to Ushas; I, 139,
4; VII, 74, 1; VIII, 87, 3 to the A*s*vins; IV, 46, I; 47, 1 to Vâyu who
was invoked in the Praüga-*s*astra belonging to the Prâta*h*-savana, and
who received the Soma offering before the other deities. There is,
nevertheless, at least one passage which shows that Ludwig has gone too
far: VIII, 76, 9. píba ít indra marútsakhâ sutám sómam dívish*t*ishu,
'Drink, O Indra, with the Maruts thy friends the Soma which has been
pressed at the divish*t*is.' The Soma oblation offered to Indra Marutvat
formed part of the second (midday) Savana.

Note <span id="an_1:45:7:2">2</span>. 'Sapráthastamam, the most
renowned, répandu.' M. M.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:45:8:1">1</span>. Comp. IV, 5, 1. kathâ´ dâ*s*ema
agnáye b*ri*hát bhâ´*h*, 'how may we offer great light to Agni?'—which
seems to mean, 'how may we make Agni brilliant?' Thus in our passage the
meaning seems to be: the priests kindle Agni and perform oblations.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:45:10:1">1</span>. The tirá*h*-ahnya Soma, which was
kept from one day to the next day (not, as Ludwig translates, 'der von
vorgestern'), was offered to the A*s*vins at the Atirâtra sacrifice.
Comp. Rig-veda I, 47, 1; III, 58, 7; VIII, 35, 19; Kâtyâyana
*S*rautasûtra XII, 6, 10; XXIV, 3, 42. There the commentary says,
â*s*vina*s*astrakayâgasambandhina*h* *k*amasasthâ*h* somâ*h*
pûrvadinanishpannatvât tirohnyâ ity u*k*yante.
