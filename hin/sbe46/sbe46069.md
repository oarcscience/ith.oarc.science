### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 9.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 5–6.

1\. We, thy friends [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:1:1.md), have chosen thee for
our protection, (we) the mortals (thee) the god, the offspring of the
Waters, the blessed one with fine
splendour [2](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:1:2.md), who gloriously advances, the
unmenaced one.

2\. When thou, finding pleasure in the wood, hast gone to thy mothers,
the Waters, that return of thine, Agni, (to this world) should not be
slighted, when dwelling afar thou hast come hither.

3\. High above (all) pungent sharpness thou hast grown
up [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:3:1.md), and verily thou art kind-hearted. Some
go forward here and there; others sit around thee, in whose friendship
thou abidest [2](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:3:2.md).

4\. He who has passed beyond (all) failures, beyond all
hindrances [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:4:1.md), the guileless, watchful
ones [2](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:4:2) have found him as a lion (is found.md),
when he had gone into the Waters;

5\. He who had run as it were by his own might, Agni, who thus dwelt in
concealment—Him Mâtari*s*van brought hither from afar, from the gods,
when he had been produced by attrition (of the woods).

6\. (And thus) the mortals have taken thee up, O carrier of sacrificial
food towards the gods [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:6:1.md), because thou, O
(god) belonging to Manus, protectest all sacrifices by the power of thy
mind, O youngest one!

7 [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:7:1.md). This is something glorious; herein thy
wonderful power shows itself even to the simple, that the cattle lie
down round about thee when

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

thou hast been kindled, O Agni, at the approach of
darkness [2](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:7:2.md).

8\. Make your offerings in (Agni), the best performer of worship, the
sharp one who purifies with his flames [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:8:1.md).
Serve ye, obediently the god, the quick messenger, the agile, the old,
the adorable.

9 [1](sbe46069.htm#an_3:9:9:1.md). Three hundred and three thousand gods
and thirty and nine did service to Agni. They sprinkled him with ghee
and spread out for him the sacrificial grass: then they made him sit
down as a Hot*ri*.
