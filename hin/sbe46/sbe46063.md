### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 3.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 20–21.

#### TO AGNI VAI*S*VÂNARA.

1\. They have worshipped Vai*s*vânara with his broad stream of light
with prayers [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:1:1.md) and treasures in order that he
may walk on firm ground. For immortal Agni honours the gods, and from of
old he has not violated the laws.

2\. The wonderful messenger goes between the two worlds (heaven and
earth), the Hot*ri* who has sat down, the Purohita of Manus. He takes
care of his wide dwelling day by day, Agni who, incited by the gods,
gives wealth for our prayers.

3\. The priests have exalted with their thoughts Agni, the banner of
sacrifices, the achiever of sacrifice [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:3:1.md). From
him in whom they have put together their (sacrificial) works and their
prayers, the sacrificer desires blessings.

4\. The father of sacrifices, the miraculous lord of those who know
prayers (?) [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:4:1.md), Agni, is the measure and
rule [2](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:4:2.md) of the sacrificers; he has entered the
two manifold-shaped worlds; the sage beloved by many people is glorified
in his foundations.

5\. The gods have established here in great beauty Agni the bright with
his bright chariot, whose every law is
golden [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:5:1.md), Vai*s*vânara who dwells in the
waters, who finds the sun, the diver, the swift one covered with
strength, the quick one.

6\. Agni, spreading out with his thought the manifold-adorned sacrifice,
together with the gods and

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

with the people of Manus, goes as a charioteer to and fro with (gods and
men) who accomplish the sacrifice, the quick, domestic (god), the
dispeller of curses.

7\. Agni, be wakeful [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:7:1.md) in our life which may
be blessed with offspring; swell with sap; shine upon us (plenty of)
food. Stir up vigour and the great ones, O watchful (god). Thou art the
U*s*i*g* (or willing one) of the gods, the good-minded (lord) of
prayers.

8\. The lord of the tribe, the vigorous [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:8:1.md)
guest, the guider of prayers, the U*s*i*g* (or willing one) of those who
invoke him, *G*âtavedas, the light of worship—him men constantly praise
with adoration, with solicitations for their welfare.

9\. The resplendent, joyous god, Agni on his chariot, has with his might
encompassed the dwellings. May we honour in our house with beautiful
prayers [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:9:1.md) his commands who is rich in
manifold prosperity.

10\. O Vai*s*vânara, I love thy statutes by which thou hast found the
sun, O far-seeing one. When born thou hast filled the worlds, heaven and
earth; Agni, thou encompassest all these (beings) by thyself.

11\. For Vai*s*vânara's wonderful deeds he the sage alone has by his
great skill mightily [1](sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:11:1.md) let loose (his
powers?). Agni has been born exalting. both his parents, Heaven and
Earth, rich in seed.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 10 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 11 = TS. I,
5, 11, 1.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:3:1:1">1</span>. A meaning like 'prayer' seems to
recommend itself for most of the passages in which the substantive víp
occurs, for instance, V, 68, 1. prá va*h* mitrâ´ya gâyata váru*n*âya víp
girâ´; IX, 22, 3. eté pûtâ´*h* vipa*sk*íta*h* sómâsa*h* … vípâ´ ví
â´na*s*u*h* dhíya*h*; IX, 65, 12. ayâ´ *k*ittá*h* vípâ´ anáyâ hári*h*
pavasva dhâ´rayâ; III, 10, 5 (see below), &c. As the verb vip means 'to
be in trembling agitation,' the same word as a substantive may designate
enthusiastic thoughts or prayers. Comp. vépate matî´, IX, 71, 3; X, II,
6, and the nouns vípra, vipa*sk*ít, vipodhâ´. We need not enter here
upon the question, whether some concrete trembling or shaking objects
also were designated as vípa*h*, and whether Bergaigne (Religion
Védique, I, p. vii) is right in taking the víp áya*h*-agrâ, with which
Trita killed the boar (X, 99, 6), as a 'prière à pointe de fer' (comp.
Macdonell, Journ. R. Asiatic Society, 1893, p. 431; 1895, p. 185).—In
our verse vípa*h* may be either nominative or accusative. I have
translated it as an accusative; in the case of the nominative the
translation would be: 'The prayers have worshipped Vai*s*vânara with
treasures.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:3:3:1">1</span>. The text has vidáthasya.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:3:4:1">1</span>. Ásura*h* vipa*h*-*k*ítâm. On the
meaning of ásura, which implies the possession of secret, supernatural
power, see H. O., Religion des Veda, 162 seq.—Comp. von Bradke, Dyâus
Asura, pp. 64–65.

Note <span id="an_3:3:4:2">2</span>. 'Richtschnur und Weg der Opferer,'
Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 306.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:3:5:1">1</span>. Literally, 'whose rules are
yellow.' The meaning is that Agni's whole sphere of activity bears the
golden

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

yellow colour. Sâya*n*a gives the interesting remark 'haritva*k*am iti
*s*âkhântaram,' but no doubt hárivratam is right.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:3:7:1">1</span>. Comp. Neisser, Bezzenberger's
Beiträge, XIII, 297.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_3:3:8:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 36, 1, note 2.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_3:3:9:1">1</span>. Comp. II, 4, 1, note 1.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_3:3:11:1">1</span>. Prof. Max Müller proposes to
translate, 'has sent forth his great song,' and observes, 'Might not
b*ri*hat be like b*ri*hat sâ´ma, a name of a hymn?'
