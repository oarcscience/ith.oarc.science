### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 15.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 7.

1\. I bring a prayer to the worshipper, the renowned sage, the glorious,
ancient one. Agni is the highly gracious Asura, taking his seat in
gh*ri*ta, the holder of wealth, supporting goods.

2\. By *Ri*ta they have supported the supporting *Ri*ta, near the
powerful (performer) [1](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:2:1.md) of sacrifice, in
highest heaven, the men who sit [2](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:2:2.md) on the
supporting support of the sky, and who with born (men) attained to the
unborn.

3\. Dispelling anguish [1](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:3:1.md) they spread out for
the ancient one [2](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:3:2.md) his
bodies [3](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:3:3.md), mighty vital power, difficult to
overcome. May he, the new-born, traverse the spaces. They have stood
round him as round an angry lion.

4\. When thou carriest, spreading out, man after man like a mother, for
their nourishment and for their sight, when thou growest
old [1](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:4:1.md) assuming life after life, thou goest
around by thyself in manifold shapes.

5\. May gain protect now the boundaries of thy strength, the wide,
firmly supporting milkstream [1](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:5:1.md) of wealth, O
god! Putting down thy foot in secret like a
thief [2](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:5:2.md), thou hast enlightened and freed
Atri for the sake of wealth mightily [3](sbe46119.htm#an_5:15:5:3.md).

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Dharu*n*a Âṅgirasa (cf. dharú*n*a*h* vásva*h* agní*h*,
verse 1; *ri*tám dharú*n*am, divá*h* dhárman dharú*n*e, verse 2; dógham
dharú*n*am, verse 5); the metre, Trish*t*ubh.—No verse of this hymn
occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:15:2:1">1</span>. It may be asked whether *s*âká,
beside its meaning 'the powerful (helper),' may also mean 'the power.'
This would suit very well, V, 30, 10. sám tâ´*h* (scil. gâ´*h*) índra*h*
as*rig*at asya *s*âkaí*h*; VI, 19, 4. tám va*h* índram *k*atínam asya
*s*âkaí*h* ihá nûnám vâ*g*ayánta*h* huvema. The translation then would
be: 'by the power of sacrifice.' Böhtlingk-Roth conjecture *s*â´ke.

Note <span id="an_5:15:2:2">2</span>. I believe that sedúsha*h* stands
for the nominative, cf. devâ´*h* ábibhyusha*h*, I, 11, 5; S. B. E.
XXXII, p. 28. This sedúsha*h* led on to a second accusative standing for
the nominative, n*rî´*n.—The men sitting on the support of the sky seem
to be the forefathers who have established the universal laws, the
Aṅgiras.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:15:3:1">1</span>. I consider a*m*hoyúva*h* as nom.
plur. masc., but it may also be gen. sing. masc., or acc. plur. fem., as
an epithet either of Agni or of his tanṽa*h*.

Note <span id="an_5:15:3:2">2</span>. The ancient one (pûrvyá) seems to
be Agni (cf. verse i).

Note <span id="an_5:15:3:3">3</span>. Cf. VI, 46, 12. yátra *s*û´râsa*h*
tanṽa*h* vitanvaté.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:15:4:1">1</span>. I think, like Ludwig, that
*g*arase should be accented.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:15:5:1">1</span>. These are accusatives.—Cf. on this
passage, Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 39 seq.

Note <span id="an_5:15:5:2">2</span>. Cf. H. O., Prolegomena, p. 73.

Note <span id="an_5:15:5:3">3</span>. Cf. VI, 1, 2. mahá*h* râyé
*k*itáyanta*h*.—See Geldner, Ved. Studien, I, 268.
