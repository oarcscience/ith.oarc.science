### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 73.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 19–20.

1\. He who gives vigour like wealth acquired by the
fathers [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:1:1.md), who is a good guide like the
instruction of a sage, who is pleased (by worship) like a comfortably
resting guest [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:1:2), (Agni.md) has crossed the
(sacrificial) seat of the worshipper like a Hot*ri*.

2\. He who being truthful like the god
Savit*ri* [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:1.md) protects by his power of mind
all settlements [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:2.md), praised by many like
impetuous splendour [3](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:3.md), the truthful one has
become dear like vital breath and worthy to be searched
for [4](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:2:4.md).

3 [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:3:1). (Agni.md) who possessing every refreshment
dwells on the earth like a god, like a king who has made himself
(valiant) friends [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:3:2.md), like heroes who sit in
front and under shelter, like a blameless wife beloved by her husband—

4\. Thee, O Agni, who art constantly kindled in the house, men have
worshipped in their firm dwellings. They have placed in him rich
splendour [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:4:1.md). Be thou possessed of all life,
a supporter of riches [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:4:2.md).

5\. May the liberal givers, O Agni, attain nourishment, may the
rich [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:5:1) who bestow gifts (on us.md) attain to a
full span of life. May we win in battles the booty of him who does not
give [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:5:1), obtaining a (rich.md) share before the
gods, that we may win glory [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:5:2.md).

6\. The lowing milch-cows of *Ri*ta, assigned by Heaven, were exuberant
with their full udders. The rivers imploring the favour (of the gods)
from afar

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

have broken through the midst of the rock with their floods.

7\. Imploring favour from thee, O Agni, the worshipful (gods) have won
glory in the sky. They have made Night and Dawn of different shapes;
they have joined the black and red colour (to Night and Dawn).

8\. And may we, our liberal givers and ourselves, be the mortals whom
thou furtherest to wealth, O Agni [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:8:1.md). Like a
shadow thou followest the whole world, having filled the two worlds
(Heaven and Earth) and the air [2](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:8:2.md).

9\. May we, O Agni, guarded by thee, conquer with our racers the racers,
with our men the men, with our heroes the heroes (of our enemies). Being
masters of the riches which their fathers [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:9:1.md)
have conquered, may our rich (givers) reach a hundred winters.

10\. May these hymns, O Agni, worshipper (of the gods), be grateful to
thee, to thy mind and heart. May we be able to bridle thee, the
well-harnessed wealth [1](sbe46023.htm#an_1:73:10:1.md), acquiring the
glory which the gods have assigned us.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 5 = MS. IV, 14, 15. Verse 7 = TB. II,
7, 12, 5. Verse 10 = MS. IV, 14, 15.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:73:1:1">1</span>. Agni is compared to wealth
acquired by the fathers, being himself pit*ri*vitta, found by the
forefathers

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

of the Brâhmanic tribes. Prof. Max Müller proposes to translate: 'wealth
inherited from the fathers.'

Note <span id="an_1:73:1:2">2</span>. Comp. VII, 42, 4, and see also VI,
16, 42.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:73:2:1">1</span>. The first Pâda is identical with
the fourth of IX, 97, 48. There the expressions are referred to Soma.

Note <span id="an_1:73:2:2">2</span>. On v*rig*ána, comp. the quotations
given above, I, 60, 3, note 2; cf. IX, 87, 2. v*rig*ánam
rákshamâ*n*a*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:73:2:3">3</span>. Comp. I, 64, 9. amáti*h* ná
dar*s*atâ´.

Note <span id="an_1:73:2:4">4</span>. Comp. II, 4, 1 (see below).

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:73:3:1">1</span>. The first three Pâdas are nearly
identical with III, 55, 21.

Note <span id="an_1:73:3:2">2</span>. As to the meaning of hitámitra,
comp. X, 108, 3. mitrám ena dadhâma; see also X, 132, 5, and H. O.,
Religion des Veda, 186, note 1.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:73:4:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 72, 10 (see above).

Note <span id="an_1:73:4:2">2</span>. I cannot accept Pischel's
translation of dharú*n*a*h* rayî*n*â´m, 'der Reichtum fliessen lässt'
(Vedische Studien, I, 40).—'Be thou, who art rich in all food, the
protector of riches.' M. M.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:73:5:1">1</span>. On sûrí and arí, see Bergaigne,
Rel. Véd. II, 218 seq. Aryá*h* may also be nom. pl. and mean '(we) the
poor ones.'

Note <span id="an_1:73:5:2">2</span>. 'May we win in battles the booty
of the enemy, setting aside a share for the gods to their glory.' M. M.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:73:8:1">1</span>. In the first Pâda one syllable is
wanting. Perhaps the acc. plur. yâ´n had here dissyllabic value.

Note <span id="an_1:73:8:2">2</span>. The last Pâda is identical with
the second of X, 139, 2.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:73:9:1">1</span>. Comp. above, verse 1, note 1.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:73:10:1">1</span>. Comp. *s*akéma vâ*g*ína*h* yámam,
II, 5, 1; ágne *s*akéma te vayám yámam devásya vâ*g*ína*h*, III, 27, 3.
As sudhúr and sudhúra are epithets of horses, the poet of course could
say, *s*akéma sudhûra*h* yámam te. But Agni is not only a horse; he is
also wealth (II, 1, 12; IV, 2, 5, &c.). The combination of the two
metaphors explains the curious expression sudhúra*h* râyá*h*.
