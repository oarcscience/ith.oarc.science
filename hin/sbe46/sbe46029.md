### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 79.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 27–28.

#### I.

1\. The golden-haired in the expanse [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:1:1.md) of
the atmosphere, the roaring [2](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:1:2.md) snake, is
hasting (through the air) like the wind; the brightly resplendent
watcher of the dawn [3](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:1:3.md), he who is like the
glorious, ever active and truthful
(goddesses) [4](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:1:4.md).

2\. By thy goings the beautifully-winged (birds) were
disparaged [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:2:1.md); the black
bull [2](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:2:2.md) has roared, when
here [3](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:2:3) (all this happened.md). He has come as
if with the bounteous smiling (women) [4](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:2:4.md). The
mists fly, the clouds thunder.

3\. When they have led him, who swells [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:3:1.md)
with the milk of *Ri*ta, on the straightest paths of *Ri*ta, then
Aryaman, Mitra, and Varu*n*a, he who walks round the
earth [2](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:3:2), fill the leather-bag (the cloud.md) in
the womb of the lower (atmosphere \[?\]) [3](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:3:3.md).

#### II.

4\. Agni, who art lord of booty, rich in cows, young son of
strength [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:4:1.md), bestow on us, O *G*âtavedas,
great glory.

5\. Being lighted, a Vasu, a sage, Agni who is to be magnified by
(pious) words, O (god) with many faces, shine to us so that riches may
be ours.

6\. Reigning [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:6:1.md) by night by thy own power, O
Agni, and at the break of dawn, O god with sharp teeth, burn against the
sorcerers.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

#### III.

7\. Bless us, O Agni, with thy blessings, when our Gâyatra song is
brought forward (to thee), thou to whom reverence is due in all our
prayers.

8\. Bring us wealth, O Agni, which may be always conquering, excellent
and invincible [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:8:1.md) in all battles.

9\. Bestow on us, Agni, through thy
kindness [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:9:1.md) wealth which may last all our
life [2](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:9:2.md), and have
mercy [3](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:9:3.md) on us that we may live.

#### IV.

10\. O Gotama [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:10:1.md), bring forward purified
words, bring songs to the sharp-flaming Agni, desirous of his favour.

11\. May he who tries to harm us, whether nigh or afar, fall down. Do
thou lead us alone to increase.

12\. The thousand-eyed Agni, who dwells among all tribes, scares away
the Rakshas. The praiseworthy Hot*ri* (Agni) is
praised [1](sbe46029.htm#an_1:79:12:1.md).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, 1–3 Trish*t*ubh; 4–6 Ush*n*ih; 7–12 Gâyatrî.

What in the traditional text is one hymn, consists really of four
independent hymns of three verses each. This is to be concluded from the
well-known laws of arrangement of the Sa*m*hitâ, and is confirmed by the
change of metre and by the reception of two of the four hymns into other
Vedic Sa*m*hitâs: the second (verses 4–6) is found in the Sâma-veda II,
911–913; Vâ*g*. Sa*m*hitâ XV, 35–37; Taitt.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sa*m*hitâ IV, 4,
4, 5; Maitr. Sa*m*hitâ II, 13, 8; the third (verses 7–9) in the
Sâma–veda II, 874–876. Besides, verses 1–2 occur Taitt. Sa*m*h. III, 1,
11, 4–5; verse 2, Maitr. Sa*m*h. IV, 12, 5; verse 4, Sâma-veda I, 99;
verses 8, 9, Maitr. Sa*m*h. IV, 12, 4; verse 9, Maitr. Sa*m*h. IV, 10,
6; Taitt. Br. II, 4, 5, 3.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:79:1:1">1</span>. As to visârá I think we should
compare VII, 36, 1. ví sâ´nunâ p*ri*thivî´ sasre urvî´, 'The wide earth
has expanded with her surface.' Prof. Max Müller observes with regard to
this Pâda: when the sky sends forth the rain, the lightning appears.

Note <span id="an_1:79:1:2">2</span>. On dhúni, see vol. xxxii, p. 112
(I, 64, 5), and Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 268. I do not take the
word with Geldner for an epithet of Vâta, the wind, but of the snake,
i. e. Agni, who very probably is to be understood here as in the whole
T*rik*a, as the fire of the lightning.

Note <span id="an_1:79:1:3">3</span>. Perhaps we have here again a Pâda
of ten syllables, of the type which occurs several times in the
preceding hymns. Or possibly the text should be corrected: ushása*l*e ná
návedâ*h*, 'a knower (of sacrifices, comp. IV, 23, 4; V, 12, 3) like the
dawns,' or ushásâm návedâ*h* (with dissyllabic -âm), 'a knower of the
dawns.'—See Lanman, p. 565.

Note <span id="an_1:79:1:4">4</span>. The waters? Or the dawns?

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:79:2:1">1</span>. On the nasalization of aminantan̐
in the Sa*m*hitâ text, see my Prolegomena, p. 471.

Note <span id="an_1:79:2:2">2</span>. I. e. Par*g*anya, the thundering
cloud. Comp. V, 83, 1; VII, 10t, 1; Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, III, 27
seq.

Note <span id="an_1:79:2:3">3</span>. Regarding yádi idám, comp. IV, 5,
11. There the verb belonging to yádi must be supplied; in the same way
our passage must be interpreted also, unless we resort to changing the
text and accentuating the verb nonâva, in which case the translation
would be, 'when the black bull has bellowed here.'

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

Note <span id="an_1:79:2:4">4</span>. The women may be the showers of
rain. Or they could be understood as the dawns,. comp. ushása*h*
návedâ*h*, verse 1.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:79:3:1">1</span>. I propose to read píyânam.

Note <span id="an_1:79:3:2">2</span>. On pári*g*man, see Joh. Schmidt,
Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 86; Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV,
27 seq.; Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 505; and compare especially X, 93, 4.
The word evidently is connected not with the verb gam, but with kshám,
'the earth,' of which we find the genitives gmá*h* and *g*má*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:79:3:3">3</span>. It does not seem probable to me
that úpara means here the lower pressing-stone, as Grassmann, Ludwig,
and Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 109) suggest (Grassmann: den Schlauch
beim untern Pressstein. Ludwig: den schlauch … an des steines ort.
Pischel: sie legen das Fell mitten auf den Stein). I propose to supply
rá*g*asa*h*; comp. I, 62, 5. rá*g*a*h* úparam; IV, 1, 11. rá*g*asa*h*
asyá yónau, and especially IV, 17, 14, where we find the 'womb of the
atmosphere' (rá*g*asa*h* asyá yónau) mentioned, quite as in our passage,
together with the leather-bag (tvá*k*), i. e. the cloud.—Bergaigne (Rel.
Véd. II, 505) translates and explains, 'arrose la peau dans le séjour de
l’inférieur,' c’est-à-dire fait couler les eaux du ciel pour l’Agni
terrestre.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:79:4:1">1</span>. See above, I, 26, 10, note 1.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:79:6:1">1</span>. Râ*g*an seems to be the participle
of râ*g*; comp. VIII, 19, 3i. kshapá*h* vástushu râ*g*asi. Now it is
very improbable that of this participle a vocative should occur; see
Lanman, 509. I believe, therefore, that we should accentuate râ´*g*an
(comp. the remarks of Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 204).

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:79:8:1">1</span>. Comp. IX, 63, 11. rayîm …
dush*t*áram.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:79:9:1">1</span>. As to su*k*etúnâ, comp. I, 159, 5.

Note <span id="an_1:79:9:2">2</span>. Comp. VI, 59, 9. rayím
vi*s*vâ´yuposhasam.

Note <span id="an_1:79:9:3">3</span>. Mâr*d*îkám is a second object of
dhehi, not an epithet of rayím. Comp. VIII, 7, 30.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:79:10:1">1</span>. Comp. above, 78, 2, note 1.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_1:79:12:1">1</span>. On the use of the middle of g*ri*
with passive meaning, comp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, 264.
