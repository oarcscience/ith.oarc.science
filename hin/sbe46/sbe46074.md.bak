### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 14.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 14.

1\. The joy-giving Hot*ri* has taken his place at the
sacrifices [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:1:1.md), He the true, the sacrificer,
the highest sage, the worshipper. Agni whose chariot is lightning, the
son of strength, whose hair is flame, has spread forth his light over
the earth.

2\. It [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:2:1.md) has been offered to thee—be pleased
with the adoring speech [2](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:2:2.md)—to thee who is
observant of it, O righteous, strong one. Bring hither thou who art
wise, the wise (gods). Sit down on the sacrificial grass in the middle
(of it) for bliss, O worshipful one!

3\. To thee, Agni, Night and Dawn who further thy
strength [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:3:1.md), shall hasten on the paths of the
wind. When (the mortals) anoint the ancient
one [2](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:3:2.md) with offerings,
they [3](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:3:3.md) stand in the house as on a
chariot-seat [4](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:3:4.md).

4\. Mitra and Varu*n*a, O strong Agni, and all the Maruts shall sing to
thee a pleasant song, when thou, O son of strength, standest with thy
flames, a sun spreading out men [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:4:1.md) over the
(terrestrial) dwellings.

5\. We have given thee thy desire to-day, sitting down near thee
adoringly with outstretched hands [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:5:1.md):
sacrifice thou to the gods as a priest with thy mind most skilled in
sacrifice, with unerring thoughts, O Agni!

6\. From thee indeed, O son of strength, proceed manifold divine
blessings and gains [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:6:1.md). Give us thousandfold
true wealth according to thy guileless word, O Agni!

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

7\. What we have done here for thee at this sacrifice, we mortals, O
skilful and thoughtful god, take thou notice of all that, O (god) with
the good chariot [1](sbe46074.htm#an_3:14:7:1.md); make all this
(sacrificial food) here savoury, immortal Agni!

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 5 = VS. XVIII, 75.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:14:1:1">1</span>. On vidátha, comp. I, 31, 6, note
2.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:14:2:1">1</span>. The subject to be supplied seems
to be náma*h*-ukti*h*.

Note <span id="an_3:14:2:2">2</span>. The words náma*h*-uktim *g*ushasva
form a parenthesis, as Ludwig has seen.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:14:3:1">1</span>. It is possible that here, as in
several other passages, a confusion between the two verbs vâ*g*áyati and
vâ*g*ayáti has taken place. If the reading were vâ*g*ayántî, we should
have to translate, 'Night and Dawn who are striving together (as if
running a race against each other?).'

Note <span id="an_3:14:3:2">2</span>. The ancient one is Agni.

Note <span id="an_3:14:3:3">3</span>. The two goddesses, Night and Dawn.

Note <span id="an_3:14:3:4">4</span>. The Padapâ*th*a has vandhúrâ-iva,
which may be the dual of vandhúr (I, 34, 9). But more probably it should
be vandhúre-iva (nom. dual, neuter or loc. sing.), comp. I, 64, 9. â´
vandhúreshu … tasthau; I, 139, 4. ádhi vâm sthâ´ma vandhúre; III, 43, 1.
vandhuresh*th*â´*h*, and see III, 6, 10. adhvaréva. On contracted
Prag*ri*hya vowels, see H. O., Die Hymnen des Rig-veda, I, p. 456.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:14:4:1">1</span>. On n*rî´*n and the different
theories proposed for this word, see above, I, 146, 4, note 5.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:14:5:1">1</span>. Comp. X, 79, 2. uttânáhastâ*h*.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:14:6:1">1</span>. For this hemistich, comp. VI, 13,
1; 34, 1.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:14:7:1">1</span>. The traditional text has tvám
ví*s*vasya suráthasya bodhi, which can only mean, 'take thou notice of
every one who has a good chariot'—which Bergaigne (Quelques observations
sur les figures de rhétorique dans le Rig-veda, p. 15) explains: 'Le
char en question est la prière qui amène le dieu au sacrifice.' I
believe that the text is corrupt; instead of suráthasya I think we
should read surathâsya (= suratha asya).
