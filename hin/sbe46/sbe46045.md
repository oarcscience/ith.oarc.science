### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 147.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 16.

1\. How, O Agni, have the resplendent ones worshipped thee, aspiring
through the powers of the Âyu [1](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:1:1.md),
when [2](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:1:2.md) the gods, obtaining kith and kin of
both races [3](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:1:3) (human and divine?.md), rejoiced
in the song of *Ri*ta (or Right) [4](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:1:4.md)?

2\. Give heed to this my proffered hymn, O youngest one, which is most
rich in liberal gifts [1](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:2:1.md), O self-dependent
one! The one abuses thee, the other praises thee: I thy reverer revere
thy body, O Agni [2](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:2:2.md)!

3\. Thy guardians, O Agni, who saw and saved the blind son of Mamatâ
from distress [1](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:3:1.md)—he the possessor of all
wealth has saved them who have done good
deeds [2](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:3:2.md). The impostors, trying to deceive,
have not deceived.

4\. The niggard, O Agni, the harmful and malicious who injures us by
falsehood: may the heavy spell recoil on him; may he injure his own body
by his evil words [1](sbe46045.htm#an_1:147:4:1.md).

5\. And, O strong one, whatever mortal knowingly injures another mortal
by falsehood: from such a one, O praised Agni, protect him who praises
thee. Agni! Do not deliver us to distress.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 2 = VS. XII, 42; TS. IV, 2, 3, 4; MS.
II, 7, 10. Verse 3 = RV. IV, 4, 13; TS. I, 2, 14, 5; MS. IV, 11, 5.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:147:1:1">1</span>. The Âyu seems to be Agni himself.
Or is it admissible to interpret âyó*h* as standing *metri causâ* for
âyáva*h*? Then the hemistich would refer to the mythical sacerdotal
tribe of the Âyus, the ancient worshippers of Agni. Comp., for instance,
X, 7, 5; 46, 8. The translation would be, 'How, O Agni, have the
resplendent Âyus worshipped thee, aspiring with their powers?'

Note <span id="an_1:147:1:2">2</span>. 'Because.' M. M.

Note <span id="an_1:147:1:3">3</span>. Comp. VIII, 103, 7. ubhé toké
tánaye dasma vi*s*pate párshi râ´dha*h* maghónâm.

Note <span id="an_1:147:1:4">4</span>. As to *ri*tásya sâ´man, comp.
Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXII, 2, and *ri*tásya *s*lóka*h*, Rig-veda IV, 23, 8.
Our Pâda recurs IV, 7, 7 with the reading *ri*tásya dhâ´man.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:147:2:1">1</span>. With vá*k*asa*h*
má*m*hish*th*asya compare má*m*hish*th*âbhi*h* matíbhi*h*, VIII, 23, 23.

Note <span id="an_1:147:2:2">2</span>. Cf. Aufrecht, Kuhn's Zeitschrift,
III, 200.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:147:3:1">1</span>. Dîrghatamas the son of Mamatâ is
the reputed author of this section of the first Ma*nd*ala which belongs
indeed to a family of priests claiming descent from him. The story of
the blindness of Dîrghatamas and of the distress into which he fell is
told in the Mahâbhârata I, 4179 seq., ed. Calc.; comp. also Geldner,
Vedische Studien, II, 145.

Note <span id="an_1:147:3:2">2</span>. Considering the construction of
the whole verse from the grammatical point of view only, one will
scarcely be tempted to translate otherwise than we have done. But it is
rather strange that Agni is represented here as saving those very
guardians by the aid of whom he has saved Mâmateya. The meaning which
one should expect to find expressed, is rather that Agni, as he has
saved Mâmateya by his guardians, has saved also, and will save, all
pious worshippers. This meaning may be established

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

if we consider the construction of the verse as similar, for instance,
to that of I, 37, 12 (vol. xxxii, p. 64): máruta*h* yát ha va*h* bálam
*g*ánân a*k*u*k*yavîtana, 'O Maruts, with such strength as yours, you
have caused men to tremble.' Thus we may, I believe, translate here,
'Agni! With such guardians as thine who have seen and saved the blind
son of Mamatâ from distress, he, the possessor of all wealth (i. e.
Agni), has saved all those who have done good deeds.' Bergaigne (III,
191) understands the verse in the same way.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:147:4:1">1</span>. The Vedic idea of the evil deeds
recoiling on the evil-doer himself has been treated of by Bergaigne,
III, 190 seq.
