### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 72.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 17–18.

1\. He has brought down (i. e. surpassed) the wisdom of many a
worshipper [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:1:1.md), he who holds in his hand all
manly power. Agni has become the lord of treasures, he who brought
together all (powers of) immortality.

2 [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:1.md). All the clever immortals when seeking
did not find the calf though sojourning round about us. The attentive
(gods), wearying themselves, following his
footsteps [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:2.md), stood at the highest,
beautiful [3](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:3.md) standing-place of Agni.

3\. When the bright ones [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:3:1.md) had done
service [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:3:2.md) to thee, the bright one, Agni,
with Gh*ri*ta through three autumns, they assumed worshipful names; the
well-born shaped their own bodies.

4\. Acquiring (or, exploring?) for themselves the two great worlds, the
worshipful ones brought forward their Rudra-like
powers [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:4:1). The mortal, when (beings.md) were in
discord [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:4:2.md), perceived and found out Agni
standing in the highest place.

5\. Being like-minded they [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:1.md) reverentially
approached him on their knees. Together with their wives they venerated
the venerable one [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:2.md). Abandoning their bodies
they made them their own [3](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:3), the (one.md) friend
waking when the (other) friend closed his
eyes [4](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:4.md).

6\. When the worshipful (gods) have discovered the thrice seven secret
steps [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:6:1) (or, places.md) laid down in thee, they
concordantly guard with them immortality.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Protect thou the
cattle and that which remains steadfast [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:6:2.md)
and that which moves.

7\. Knowing, O Agni, the established
orders [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:1) of (human.md) dwellings, distribute in
due order gifts [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:2.md) that they may live.
Knowing the ways which the gods go [3](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:3.md), thou
hast become the unwearied messenger, the bearer of oblations.

8\. They who knew the right way and were filled with good intentions,
beheld from heaven the seven young [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:8:1.md)
(rivers) and the doors of riches. Saramâ found the strong stable of the
cows from which human clans receive their
nourishment [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:8:2.md).

9\. The Earth has spread herself far and wide with them who are great in
their greatness, the mother Aditi, for the refreshment of the
bird [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:9:1.md), with her sons who have assumed all
powers of their own dominion [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:9:2.md), preparing
(for themselves) the way to immortality.

10\. When the immortals created the two eyes of
heaven [1](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:1.md), they placed fair splendour in him
(Agni) [2](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:2.md). Then they rush
down [3](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:3.md) like streams let loose. The red ones
have recognised, O Agni, those which are directed
downwards [4](sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:4.md).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 1 = TS. II, 2, 12, 1. Verse 3 = TB.
II, 4, 5, 6. Verses 8–9 = TB. II, 5, 8, 10.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:72:1:1">1</span>. The meaning seems to me to be: by
his wisdom he excels all human wisdom. Prof. Max Müller translates:
'Agni, who holds in his hand all that men desire, conquers

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (or, wins for
himself) the praises of many a wise worshipper.' And the last Pâda: 'he
who brought together all immortal blessings.'—On *s*a*s*vat, see VI, 61,
1; VII, 18, 18; VIII, 23, 28.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:72:2:1">1</span>. Here we have again the myth of the
hidden Agni whom the gods seek. Agni is meant by the calf.

Note <span id="an_1:72:2:2">2</span>. Going on foot, Sâya*n*a.

Note <span id="an_1:72:2:3">3</span>. I follow Sâya*n*a, Bollensen, and
Ludwig in taking *k*â´ru as a locative.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:72:3:1">1</span>. 'Was not Sâya*n*a right in taking
this verse as referring to the Maruts? Cf. VI, 48, 21.… su*g*âta also is
an epithet of the Maruts, I, 88, 3; 166, 12.' M. M.

Note <span id="an_1:72:3:2">2</span>. As to the subjunctive, comp.
Delbrück, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, p. 67. The Taittirîya Brâhma*n*a
(II, 4, 5, 6) reads saparyán.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:72:4:1">1</span>. I follow the Padapâ*th*a which has
rudríyâ. But possibly we may have the nom. plur. rudríyâ*h*: 'the
worshipful Rudriyas (i. e. Maruts) rushed forward.'

Note <span id="an_1:72:4:2">2</span>. The translation of nemádhitâ is in
jeopardy.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:72:5:1">1</span>. Probably the mortals, as Ludwig
understands it. Comp. márta*h*, verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:72:5:2">2</span>. The venerable one is Agni.

Note <span id="an_1:72:5:3">3</span>. Possibly the text is corrupt. In
IV, 24, 3 we read ririkvâ´*m*sa*h* tanṽa*h* k*rin*vata trâ´m,
'abandoning (i. e. risking) their bodies they took him (Indra) for their
protector' (comp. I, 100, 7). Should svâ´*h* have supplanted another
word, for instance, trâ´m? As the pronoun svá very frequently stands in
apposition with tanû´, it may have found its way also into passages to
which it did not belong.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

Note <span id="an_1:72:5:4">4</span>. The meaning seems to be that
whenever the attention of one of the friends relaxed, another friend
watched instead of the first. See Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl.
Gesellschaft, XLIV, 328; Bartholomae, Studien zur indogerm.
Sprachgeschichte, I, 95.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:72:6:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a explains the trí*h* saptá
padâ´ as the three times seven kinds of sacrifices, the seven
Pâkaya*gñ*as, the seven Havirya*gñ*as, the seven Somaya*gñ*as. But this
later system of the twenty-one forms of sacrifice can scarcely have
existed at the time of the Rig-veda Sa*m*hitâ. Three times seven is a
favourite number in Rig-vedic mysticism; comp. I, 191, 12. 14; IV, 1,
16; VII, 87, 4; VIII, 46, 26; 69, 7; 96, 2; IX, 70, 1; 86, 21; X, 64, 8;
90, 15: Possibly three times seven pieces of wood (samídha*h*) are
alluded to, comp. X, 90, 15, but everybody who has studied Bergaigne's
Arithmétique mythologique (Rel. Véd. II, 114 seq.; see especially p.
122) will admit that there are ever so many possible interpretations of
a passage like this. Prof. Max Müller's translation is: 'The worshipful
gods found in thee the twenty-one words which are hidden in thee. They
guard with them the immortal (Agni).'—Instead of avidan (Padapâ*th*a) I
think we must read ávidan.

Note <span id="an_1:72:6:2">2</span>. Ludwig certainly is wrong in
translating 'hüte du den wandel von tier and pflanze.' The author of
this group of hymns is very fond of the phrase sthâtú*h* *k*arátham and
the like; see I, 68, 1; 70, 3. 7. Tire same phrase, in one or the other
of its possible shapes, has evidently been used by him here also. The
plural masculine sthât*rî´n* is indeed very strange. Possibly J.
Wackernagel is right in reading sthât*rî´*n (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV,
287; comp. Lanman, p. 422); the reading sthât*rî´n* may be due to the
neighbourhood of pa*s*û´n. This sort of blunder is very frequent in the
text of the Rig-veda. Prof. Max Müller suggests: the stabled cattle and
what moves about (in the meadows).

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:72:7:1">1</span>. On vayúna, comp. Pischel, Ved.
Studien, I, 295. 300. 'The thoughts of human beings.' M. M.

Note <span id="an_1:72:7:2">2</span>. *S*urúdh: Pischel, Ved. Studien,
I, 32. 50.

Note <span id="an_1:72:7:3">3</span>. 'Which lead to the gods?' M. M.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:72:8:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 26, 10, note 1.—'Beheld
the seven young rivers coming down from heaven.' M. M.

Note <span id="an_1:72:8:2">2</span>. See Delbrück, Syntaktische
Forschungen, I, 87.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:72:9:1">1</span>. The bird seems to be Agni.

Note <span id="an_1:72:9:2">2</span>. The Padapâ*th*a gives
su-apatyâ´ni. There is no doubt a word su-apatyá, 'blessed with good
offspring.' This is frequently used together with such nouns as rayi,
kshaya, ish; it stands in several passages by the side of pra*g*âvat.
See I, 117, 19; II, 2, 12; 4, 8; 9, 5; III, 3, 7; 16, 1; IV, 2, 11; X,
30, 12. But from this word should be distinguished sva-patyá, derived
from svá-pati (X, 44, 1, &c.), 'a man's own dominion,' or 'own
rulership;' comp. *g*âspatyá. This word is found here, and in some other
passages, for instance, VII, 91, 3. ví*s*vâ ít nára*h* svapatyâ´ni
*k*akru*h*, 'the heroes have exercised all the powers of their own
dominion;' VIII, 15, 10. satrâ´ ví*s*vâ svapatyâ´ni dadhishe, 'thou hast
assumed (Indra) all powers of thy own dominion altogether.'—Ludwig
translates correctly, 'alle selbstherlichkeit.'

The Taittirîya Brâhma*n*a reads *k*akrú*h* for tasthú*h*. This reading
evidently rests on Rig-veda IV, 34, 9; VII, 91, 3. There is no reason,
however, for preferring this to the traditional reading of our Rik-text.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:72:10:1">1</span>. The sun and the moon? This very
natural explanation will scarcely be modified on account of passages
like the following (*S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a I, 6, 3, 38):

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'These are the two
eyes of the sacrifice, the (oblations of butter called) Â*g*yabhâgas.'

Note <span id="an_1:72:10:2">2</span>. Comp. below, 73, 4.

Note <span id="an_1:72:10:3">3</span>. It is not necessary to change the
text; I believe, however, that the conjecture adhá*h* ksharanti (they
stream downwards) would not be quite improbable. Comp. my Prolegomena,
p. 369, note 1.—The subject seems to be the streams of sacrificial
libations.

Note <span id="an_1:72:10:4">4</span>. Both expressions, 'the red ones'
and 'those which are directed downwards,' are feminine. The red ones may
be the dawns. But these cannot be called 'directed downwards.' I take,
therefore, the one noun as a nominative, the other as an accusative.
Cannot 'those which are directed downwards' be the libations of Gh*ri*ta
and the like, which the dawns see?—Prof. Max Müller translates: 'People
recognised the red netherward mares (of thee), O Agni.' He supplies
*g*vâlâ*h* or takes arushî*h* as mares, cf. V, 56, 6.
