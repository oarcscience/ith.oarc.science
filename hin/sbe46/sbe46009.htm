<p>1. We implore&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:1">1</A> with well-spoken words the vigorous&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:2">2</A> Agni who belongs to many people&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:3">3</A>, to the clans that worship the gods&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:4">4</A>, whom other people (also) magnify.</p>  
<p>2. Men have placed Agni (on the altar) as the augmenter of strength. May we worship thee, rich in sacrificial food. Thus be thou here to-day gracious to us, a helper in our striving for gain, O good one!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>3. We choose thee, the all-possessor, as our messenger and as our Hot<I>ri</I>. The flames of thee, who art great, spread around; thy rays touch the heaven.</p>  
<p>4. The gods, Varu<I>n</I>a, Mitra, Aryaman, kindle thee, the ancient messenger. The mortal, O Agni, who worships thee, gains through thee every prize.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>5. Thou art the cheerful Hot<I>ri</I> and householder, O Agni, the messenger of the clans. In thee all the firm laws are comprised which the gods have made&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:5:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>6. In thee, the blessed one, O Agni, youngest god, all sacrificial food is offered. Sacrifice then thou who art gracious to us to-day and afterwards&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:6:1">1</A>, to the gods that we may be rich in valiant men.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>7. Him, the king, verily the adorers approach reverentially. With oblations men kindle Agni, having overcome all failures.</p>  
<p>8. Destroying the foe&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:8:1">1</A>, they (victoriously) got through Heaven and Earth and the waters; they</p>  
<p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></A></p>  
<p>have made wide room for their dwelling. May the manly (Agni)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:8:2">2</A>, after he has received the oblations, become brilliant at the side of Ka<I>n</I>va; may he neigh as a horse in battles.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>9. Take thy seat; thou art great. Shine forth, thou who most excellently repairest to the gods. O Agni, holy god, emit thy red, beautiful smoke, O glorious one!</p>  
<p>10. Thou whom the gods have placed here for Manu as the best performer of the sacrifice, O carrier of oblations, whom Ka<I>n</I>va and Medhy&acirc;tithi, whom V<I>ri</I>shan and Upastuta&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:10:1">1</A> (have worshipped,) the winner of prizes.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>11. That Agni's nourishment has shone brightly whom Medhy&acirc;tithi and Ka<I>n</I>va have kindled on behalf of <I>Ri</I>ta&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:11:1">1</A>. Him do these hymns, him do we extol.</p>  
<p>12. Fill (us with) wealth, thou self-dependent one, for thou, O Agni, hast companionship with the gods. Thou art lord over glorious booty. Have mercy upon us; thou art great.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>13. Stand up straight for blessing us, like the god Savit<I>ri</I>, straight a winner of booty, when we with our worshippers and with ointments&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:13:1">1</A> call thee&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:13:2">2</A> in emulation (with other people).</p>  
<p>14. Standing straight, protect us by thy splendour from evil; burn down every ghoul&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:14:1">1</A>. Let us stand straight that we may walk and live. Find out our worship&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:14:2">2</A> among the gods.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>15. Save us, O Agni, from the sorcerer, save us from mischief, from the niggard. Save us from him</p>  
<p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="green">p. 33</font></A></p>  
<p>who does us harm or tries to kill us, O youngest god with bright splendour!</p>  
<p>16. As with a club&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:16:1">1</A> smite the niggards in all directions, and him who deceives us, O god with fiery jaws. The mortal who makes (his weapons) very sharp by night, may that impostor not rule over us.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>17. Agni has won abundance in heroes, Agni prosperity (for Ka<I>n</I>va). Agni and the two Mitras (i.&nbsp;e. Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a) have blessed Medhy&acirc;tithi, Agni (has blessed) Upastuta in the acquirement (of wealth)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:17:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>18. Through Agni we call hither from afar Turva<I>s</I>a, Yadu, and Ugradeva. May Agni, our strength against the Dasyu, conduct Navav&acirc;stva, B<I>ri</I>hadratha, and Turv&icirc;ti&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:18:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>19. Manu has established thee, O Agni, as a light for all people. Thou hast shone forth with Ka<I>n</I>va, born from <I>Ri</I>ta, grown strong, thou whom the human races worship.</p>  
<p>20. Agni's flames are impetuous and violent; they are terrible and not to be withstood. Always burn down the sorcerers, and the allies of the Y&acirc;tus, every ghoul&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:20:1">1</A>.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The authorship of this hymn, and of the whole collection to which it belongs (I, 36&#8211;43), is ascribed to Ka<I>n</I>va Ghaura. Numerous passages show indeed that it was the family of the Ka<I>n</I>vas, or rather, to speak more accurately, a branch of that family, among which this group of hymns has been composed. But it is as great a mistake in this as in</p>  
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A></p>  
<p>a number of similar cases to accept the founder of one of the great Br&acirc;hmanical families as an author of Vedic poems. Comp. Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XLII, 215 seq.</p>  
<p>The metre is alternately B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; and Satob<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;, so that the hymn consists of strophes (Prag&acirc;tha) of two verses. Verse 1 = SV. I, 59. Verse 9 = VS. XI, 37; TS. IV, 1, 3, 3 (V, 1, 4, 5); T&Acirc;r. IV, 5, 2 (V, 4, 6); MS. II, 7, 3; IV, 9, 3. Verse 13 = SV. I, 57; VS. XI, 42; TS. IV, 1, 4, 2 (V, 1, 5, 3); MS. II, 7, 4. Verses 13, 14 = TB. III, 6, 1, 2; T&Acirc;r. IV, 20, 1; MS. IV, 13, 1. Verse 19 = SV. I, 54.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:1:1">1</A>. Literally, we entreat for you. Comp. on this use of the pronoun va<I>h</I>, Delbr&uuml;ck, Altindische Syntax, 206. See also Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beitr&auml;ge, XX, 64.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:1:2">2</A>. The meaning of yahv&aacute; cannot be determined with full certainty.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:1:3">3</A>. There is no sufficient reason to change with Ludwig (IV, 254) pur&ucirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;m to P&ucirc;r&ucirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;m, and thus to convert the metrically correct P&acirc;da into an irregular one.&#8212;Comp. Bollensen, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XXII, 593.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:1:4">4</A>. On devayat&icirc;&acute;n&acirc;m, comp. Lanman, p. 399.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:5:1">1</A>. 'On thee all the eternal works are united, i.&nbsp;e. depend, which the gods have wrought; such as sun, stars, lightning.' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:6:1">1</A>. With the third P&acirc;da compare the third P&acirc;da of verse 2. It is a galita.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:8:1">1</A>. The word 'the foe' (v<I>ri</I>tra) alludes to the name of the demon conquered by Indra; see H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 135, note 2.</p>  
<p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:8:2">2</A>. The metre would become more correct by reading v<I>ri</I>shabh&aacute;<I>h</I> instead of v<I>r&iacute;</I>sh&acirc;. Or V<I>r&iacute;</I>sha<I>n</I>i, 'with V<I>ri</I>shan'? Comp. verse 10.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:10:1">1</A>. Medhy&acirc;tithi or Medh&acirc;tithi is very frequently mentioned in connection with Ka<I>n</I>va.</p>  
<p>V<I>ri</I>shan is taken as a proper name by Boehtlingk-Roth and by Grassmann (not by Ludwig) in VI, 16, 15. Possibly they are right, but in no case can V<I>ri</I>shan of the sixth book, named by the side of Dadhya<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I> and Atharvan, be identified with any probability with the V<I>ri</I>shan mentioned in our passage, who evidently belongs to the ancestors of the Ka<I>n</I>vas.</p>  
<p>Upastuta is mentioned again together with Ka<I>n</I>va and Medhy&acirc;tithi in verse 17 of our hymn, together with Ka<I>n</I>va in VIII, 5, 25. Comp. I, 112, 15; VIII, 103, 8; X, 115, 8. 9; Bergaigne, Rel. V&eacute;d., II, 448.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:11:1">1</A>. Comp. I, 139, 2. y&aacute;t ha ty&aacute;t mitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>&acirc;v <I>ri</I>t&acirc;&acute;t &aacute;dhi &acirc;dad&acirc;&acute;the &aacute;n<I>ri</I>tam sv&eacute;na many&uacute;n&acirc;; X, 73, 5. m&aacute;ndam&acirc;na<I>h</I> <I>ri</I>t&acirc;&acute;t &aacute;dhi.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 13.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:13:1">1</A>. A<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&iacute;bhi<I>h</I> can possibly mean 'who have salved themselves.' There is no reason to think of the anointing of the y&ucirc;pa (sacrificial post), to which S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a refers the word.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:13:2">2</A>. On vi-hv&acirc;, comp. Pischel-Geldner, I, 144. There must be a technical reason, unknown to me, for the connection in which this verb repeatedly occurs, as is the case in our passage, with the noun v&acirc;ghat: comp. III, 8, 10 (see below); VIII, 5, 16. purutr&acirc;&acute; <I>k</I>it h&iacute; v&acirc;m nar&acirc; vihv&aacute;yante man&icirc;sh&iacute;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> v&acirc;gh&aacute;dbhi<I>h</I> a<I>s</I>vin&acirc; &acirc;&acute; gatam.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 14.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:14:1">1</A>. The exact meaning of atr&iacute;n is unknown.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:14:2">2</A>. Geldner's conjectures on duvas seem rather bold</p>  
<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A></p>  
<p>to me (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 233). Comp. vol. xxxii, pp. 203&#8211;206 (I, 165, 14).</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 16.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:16:1">1</A>. On ghan&eacute;va, see Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 334.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 17.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:17:1">1</A>. On Medhy&acirc;tithi and Upastuta, see the note on verse 10. Aufrecht (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, 612) believes that in mitr&oacute;t&aacute; an abbreviation of the name Mitr&acirc;tithi (X, 33, 7) is contained; he translates: 'Agni has promoted Mitr&acirc;tithi, Medhy&acirc;tithi, and Upastuta in the acquirement of wealth.' This is very ingenious, but I do not think that the reason which Aufrecht gives is sufficient: it cannot be understood, he says, why Mitra (or Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a) should be mentioned in a hymn exclusively addressed to Agni. But similar cases are quite frequent.&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller writes: 'Could mitr&acirc; stand for mitr&acirc;<I>n</I>i? Agni has protected his friends and also Medhy&acirc;tithi.' Comp. also Lanman, p. 342.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 18.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:18:1">1</A>. On Turva<I>s</I>a and Yadu, comp. Muir, V, 286; Bergaigne, II, 354 seq.; Zeitschr. der D. Morg. Ges. XLII, 220. There is not the slightest reason for Ludwig's statement (IV, 254) that this hymn is a 'gebet um sig f&uuml;r den auf einem kriegszuge befindlichen Turva&ccedil;ak&ouml;nig.'</p>  
<p>Ugradeva is not mentioned again. On Navav&acirc;stva and B<I>ri</I>hadratha, comp. X, 49, 6; VI, 20, 11; on Turv&icirc;ti, the materials collected by Bergaigne, Rel. V&eacute;d., II, 358 seq.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 20.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:36:20:1">1</A>. See verse 14, note 1.</p>
