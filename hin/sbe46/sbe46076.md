### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 16.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 16.

1\. This Agni rules over abundance in valiant men, over great happiness.
He rules over wealth consisting in offspring and cows; he rules over the
killing of foes.

2\. O Maruts [1](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:2:1), ye men, cling to this
furtherer [2](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:2:2) who possesses joy-furthering
boons—(the Maruts) who [3](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:2:3) in battles overcome
ill-minded (foes), who have deceived the
enemy [4](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:2:4) day by day.

3\. As such, O bounteous Agni, prepare [1](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:3:1) us
riches [2](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:3:2) and wealth in valiant men, which, O
highly glorious one, may be most exalted, rich in offspring, free from
plagues, and powerful.

4\. The maker who victoriously (stands) over all beings, the maker who
makes the praise arrive among the gods [1](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:4:1): he
stands firm among the gods, among the host of heroes, firm also in the
praise of men.

5\. Give us not up, Agni, to want of
thought [1](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:5:1) nor to want of heroes nor to want
of cows, O son of strength, nor to the scoffer. Drive away hostile
powers [2](sbe46076.htm#an_3:16:5:2).

6\. Help us at this sacrifice, O blessed one, with mighty gain which is
accompanied by offspring, O Agni! Let us be united with greater,
gladdening, glorious wealth, O thou of mighty splendour!

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is Pragâtha, each Pragâtha distich being
composed of one B*ri*hatî and one Satob*ri*hatî. The position of the
Sûkta in the collection and the opening words of verse 3 show that the
three Pragâthas are not independent, but form one hymn.—Verse 1 = SV. I,
60.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:16:2:1">1</span>. Comp. VII, 18, 25. imám nara*h*
maruta*h* sa*sk*ata ánu.

Note <span id="an_3:16:2:2">2</span>. The passages which Grassmann gives
for the meaning of v*rí*dh, 'stärkend, erquickend,' I, 167, 4; X, 89,
10, are quite doubtful. Probably we should have to alter the accent and
read v*ri*dhám.

Note <span id="an_3:16:2:3">3</span>. The relative clause seems to refer
to the Maruts, not to the goods (râ´ya*h*).

Note <span id="an_3:16:2:4">4</span>. Comp. VI, 46, 10. yé … *s*átrum
âdabhû*h*.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:16:3:1">1</span>. Literally, 'sharpen.'

Note <span id="an_3:16:3:2">2</span>. The genitive seems, as is also
Prof. Ludwig's opinion, to be the partitive genitive, so that the
literal meaning would be: 'Prepare us (a deal) of riches and of wealth,'
&c. Comp. píba sutásya, 'drink of the pressed Soma,' &c.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:16:4:1">1</span>. On *k*ákri*h* devéshu â´ dúva*h*,
comp. IV, 2, 9; VIII, 31, 9.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:16:5:1">1</span>. On ámati, comp. above, III, 8, 2,
note.

Note <span id="an_3:16:5:2">2</span>. Comp. VI, 59, 8. ápa dvéshâ*m*si
â´ k*ri*tam.
