### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 19.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 19.

1\. I choose Agni as Hot*ri* at this sacrificial meal, the clever sage
all-knowing and not foolish. May he, the excellent sacrificer, sacrifice
for us amid the host of the gods; may he obtain liberal boons (for us)
for the sake of wealth and strength.

2\. To thee, O Agni, I stretch forth the (ladle) rich in sacrificial
food, splendid, full of gifts, full of ghee. From left to right,
choosing the host of the gods [1](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:2:1.md), he has
established the sacrifice with gifts and
goods [2](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:2:2.md).

3\. Whoever is favoured by thee, is blessed with the sharpest spirit.
Favour him with good offspring, O god rich in
favours [1](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:3:1)! Agni, may we, (dwelling.md) in the
copiousness of manliest wealth, be rich in perfect praise of thee, the
Vasu.

4\. On thee indeed, O Agni, sacrificing men have put many faces of
(thee) the god [1](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:4:1.md). Bring hither then the host
of the gods, O youngest one, when thou wilt sacrifice to-day to the
divine host [2](sbe46079.htm#an_3:19:4:2.md).

5\. When the gods will anoint thee as the Hot*ri* at the sacrificial
meal making thee sit down for the sacrifice, be thou here, O Agni, our
furtherer, and bestow glory on our bodies.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Gâthin Kau*s*ika, the metre Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 3 = TS. I,
3, 14, 6; MS. IV, 14, 15.

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:19:2:1">1</span>. Comp. below, IV, 6, 3. This
parallel passage shows that pradakshi*n*ít belongs to urâ*n*á*h*, not to
a*s*ret. Agni is represented as choosing, i. e. inviting the host of the
gods by moving around the sacrificial food from left to right. See
concerning the Paryagnikara*n*a, which seems to be alluded to,
Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, 42 seq.

Note <span id="an_3:19:2:2">2</span>. Or, 'with the (divine) givers and
with the Vasus.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:19:3:1">1</span>. Boehtlingk-Roth seem to be right
in reading *s*iksho. Comp. VIII, 52, 8. yásmai tvám … *s*íksho
*s*íkshasi dâ*s*úshe.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:19:4:1">1</span>. They have inflamed many fires,
each of which is a face of the god Agni.

Note <span id="an_3:19:4:2">2</span>. Or, 'that thou mayest sacrifice,'
&c. See Delbrück, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, 148.
