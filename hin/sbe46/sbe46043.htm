<p>1. Ask ye him. He has come. He knows. He the intelligent one moves forward; He moves along (his way) (?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:1:1">1</A>. In him all commands, all wishes dwell. He is the lord of strength, of mighty power.</p>  
<p>2. They ask him. He himself&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:2:1">1</A> does not ask in turn what he, the wise one, has grasped by his own mind alone&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:2:2">2</A>. He does not forget the first word nor another word. Unconfused he adheres to his own power of mind.</p>  
<p>3. To him go the sacrificial ladles, to him go the racers&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:3:1">1</A>. He alone may hear all my words. He who pronounces many praishas&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:3:2">2</A>, the conqueror, the accomplisher of sacrifices whose blessings are flawless, the young child has assumed vigour.</p>  
<p>4. When he has come together&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:1">1</A> (with his companions&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:2">2</A>), he goes to greet them&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:3">3</A>. As soon as born he steals upon (his prey) together with his companions. He strokes the &#8230;&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:4">4</A> to give him delight and joy, when the loving ones&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:5">5</A> approach him who stands on them&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:6">6</A>.</p>  
<p>5. He, the animal living in the water and walking in the forest&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:5:1">1</A>, has been placed on the highest skin&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:5:2">2</A> (sky?). He has proclaimed his rules to the mortals: for Agni, the knowing one, is intent upon <I>Ri</I>ta (Right) and is true.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi. Metre, <I>G</I>agat&icirc;; the last verse is Trish<I>t</I>ubh.&#8212;No verse occurs in the other Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s.</p>  
<p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:1:1">1</A>. The Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text has s&acirc;&acute; nv&#771; &icirc;yate, the Pada text, s&aacute;<I>h</I> n&uacute; &icirc;yate. Comp. Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya 314. I propose to read s&acirc;&acute;nu (= s&aacute; &aacute;nu) &icirc;yate.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:2:1">1</A>. See Geldner, Ved. Studien, II, p. 188.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:2:2">2</A>. Possibly we should read sv&eacute;na ev&aacute;.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:3:1">1</A>. The text (&aacute;rvat&icirc;<I>h</I>) implies that these race-horses are mares. Probably, as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains, the prayers (stutaya<I>h</I>) are alluded to. See on the prayers compared with horses, Bergaigne, II, 284 seq.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:3:2">2</A>. Praish&aacute; is the technical designation of the sacrificial commands of one priest (or more especially, of the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a) to another priest; comp. Schwab, Das Altindische Thieropfer, p. 90; H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 390.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:4:1">1</A>. Sam&acirc;&acute;rata may be the third person of singular or of plural.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:4:2">2</A>. I supply 'with his companions' in consideration of the second P&acirc;da (y&uacute;<I>g</I>yebhi<I>h</I>). It is difficult to say who Agni's companions are (the flames? the officiating priests?).</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:4:3">3</A>. Ludwig's conjecture, &uacute;pa st&acirc;&acute;yam <I>k</I>arati, is very ingenious. 'He stealthily approaches them.'&#8212;On upasth&acirc;&acute;yam, comp. also Bollensen, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLVII, 586.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:4:4">4</A>. The meaning of <I>s</I>v&acirc;nt&aacute;m, which occurs here and in the obscure passage X, 61, 21 (&aacute;dha g&acirc;&acute;va<I>h</I> &uacute;pam&acirc;tim kan&acirc;&acute;y&acirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;nu <I>s</I>v&acirc;nt&aacute;sya k&aacute;sya <I>k</I>it p&aacute;r&acirc; &icirc;yu<I>h</I>), is unknown. Possibly it is related to <I>s</I>v&acirc;tr&aacute;, which means something like 'powerful' or 'prosperous.'</p>  
<p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:4:5">5</A>. The prayers? The oblations?</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:4:6">6</A>. Api-sthit&aacute;m may have active or passive meaning, 'he who stands on somebody or something,' and 'he on whom somebody or something stands.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:5:1">1</A>. The first P&acirc;da (and probably also the fourth) belong to the metrical. type described by H.&nbsp;O., Prolegomena, p. 68 seq.: the first part, before the caesura, consists of four syllables; and then the P&acirc;da goes on as if it had the pentasyllabic opening.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:145:5:2">2</A>. After Agni's abode in the Waters and in the wood has been mentioned in the first P&acirc;da, the second P&acirc;da possibly refers to his heavenly abode to which the adjective upam&aacute; (highest') seems to point. Thus the 'highest skin' would be the sky. But S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, who refers it to the Vedi, may possibly be right. His explanation would very well agree with the second hemistich.</p>
