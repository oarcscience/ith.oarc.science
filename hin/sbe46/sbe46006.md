### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 26.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 20–21.

1\. Clothe thyself, with thy clothing (of light), O sacrificial (god),
lord of all vigour; and then perform this worship for us.

2\. Sit down, most youthful god, as our desirable Hot*ri*, through (our
prayerful) thoughts [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:2:1), O Agni, with thy
word [2](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:2:2) that goes to heaven.

3\. The father verily by sacrificing procures (blessings) for the
son [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:3:1), the companion for the companion, the
elect friend for the friend.

4\. May Varu*n*a, Mitra, Aryaman, triumphant with riches
(?) [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:4:1), sit down on our sacrificial grass as
they did on Manu's.

5\. O ancient Hot*ri*, be pleased with this our friendship also, and
hear these prayers.

6\. For whenever we sacrifice constantly [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:6:1)
to this or to that god, in thee alone the sacrificial food is offered.

7\. May he be dear to us, the lord of the clan, the joy-giving, elect
Hot*ri*; may we be dear (to him), possessed of a good Agni (i. e. of
good fire).

8\. For the gods, when possessed of a good Agni, have given us excellent
wealth, and we think ourselves possessed of a good Agni.

9\. And may there be among us mutual praises of both the mortals, O
immortal one, (and the immortals) [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:9:1).

10\. With all Agnis (i. e. with all thy fires), O Agni, accept this
sacrifice and this prayer, O young (son) of
strength [1](sbe46006.htm#an_1:26:10:1).

#### NOTES.

This hymn, as well as the whole collection to which it belongs, is
ascribed to *S*una*hs*epa Â*g*îgarti (comp. 24, 12.13). The metre is
Gâyatrî. Bergaigne (Recherches sur l’histoire de la Sa*m*hitâ, II, 7)
divides this hymn into T*rik*as, with one single verse added at the end.
I cannot find sufficient evidence for this; the appearance in the
Sâma-veda (II, 967–9) of a T*rik*a composed of the verses 10. 6. 7 of
our hymn is rather against Bergaigne's opinion.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:26:2:1">1</span>. Mánmabhi*h* may possibly mean,
'with thy (wise) thoughts;' comp., for instance, III, 11, 8. pári
ví*s*vâni súdhitâ agné*h* a*s*yâma mánmabhi*h*, 'may we obtain every
bliss through Agni's (wise) thoughts,' or 'may we obtain all the
blessings of Agni for our prayers.'

Note <span id="an_1:26:2:2">2</span>. Vá*k*as stands for vá*k*asâ. See
the passages collected by Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 562, and comp. Roth,
Ueber gewisse Kürzungen des Wortendes im Veda, 5; Joh. Schmidt, Die
Pluralbildungen der indogermanischen Neutra, 304 seq. Ludwig also takes
vá*k*as as instrumental.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:26:3:1">1</span>. Agni is the father, the mortal
whose sacrifice he performs, the son.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:26:4:1">1</span>. Can ri*s*âdas be explained as a
compound of ri (Tiefstufe of rai, as gu is the Tiefstufe of gau) and
\**s*â´das, from the root *s*ad, 'to be triumphant'? Prof. Aufrecht
(Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XIV, 83; see also Neisser, Bezz. Beitr. XIX,
143) connects ri- with the Greek ἐρι- (ἐρικυδής) &c.); our hypothesis
has the advantage of not leaving the limits of Sanskrit.—Comp. M. M.’s
note on V, 60, 7; Ludwig, Ueber die neuesten Arbeiten auf dem Gebiete
der Rig-veda-Forschung (1893), p. 7.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:26:6:1">1</span>. On *s*á*s*vatâ tánâ see Lanman,
480, 515, 518.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:26:9:1">1</span>. The comparison of verse 8 and the
expression ám*ri*ta mártyânâm in the second Pâda of this verse seem to
show that ubháyeshâm does not refer to two classes of mortals, the
priests and their patrons, but to the mortals and the immortals. A
genitive am*rí*tânâm, which would make this meaning quite clear, can
easily be supplied. A Dvandva compound am*ri*tamartyâ´nâm, which one
could feel tempted to conjecture, would have, in my opinion, too modern
a character.—Prof. Max Müller writes: 'I should prefer am*ri*ta
martyânâm, not exactly as a compound, but as standing for am*ri*tânâm
martyânâm. This seems to be Ludwig's opinion too.'

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:26:10:1">1</span>. In the translation of sahasa*h*
yaho I follow Geldner, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVIII, 195; Ludwig's
translation is similar.
