### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 97.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 7, VARGA 5.

1\. Driving away evil [1](sbe46033.htm#an_1:97:1:1.md) with thy light,
Agni, shine upon us with wealth—driving away evil with thy light.

2\. Longing for rich fields, for a free path, and for wealth, we
sacrifice—driving away evil with thy light.

3 [1](sbe46033.htm#an_1:97:3:1.md). When he stands forth as the most
glorious one among them [2](sbe46033.htm#an_1:97:3:2.md), and when our
liberal lords excel—driving away evil with thy light—

4\. When through thee, Agni, the liberal lords, and when through thee we
may multiply with offspring—driving away evil with thy light—

5\. When the rays of the mighty Agni go forth on all sides—driving away
evil with thy light—

6\. For thou indeed, (O god) whose face is turned everywhere,
encompassest (the world) everywhere—driving away evil with thy light.

7\. Do thou carry us, as with a boat, across hostile powers, (O god)
whose face is turned everywhere—driving away evil with thy light.

8\. Do thou carry us across (evil) to welfare, as across a stream with a
boat [1](sbe46033.htm#an_1:97:8:1.md)—driving away evil with thy light.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Gâyatrî. The hymn is addressed to Agni
*S*u*k*i.—Verses 1–8 = AV. IV, 33, 1–8: TÂ. VI, 11, 1–2. Verse 1 = TÂ.
VI, 10, 1.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:97:1:1">1</span>. Lanman (Sanskrit Reader, p. 363)
translates: 'Driving away with flames our sin.' But aghá is not exactly
sin.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:97:3:1">1</span>. In this verse as well as in the
verses 4 and 5—all commencing with the words prá yát—the principal
clauses are wanting. As to 3 meaning, however, these clauses are
supplied by the refrain; 'driving away evil' of course means 'may he
drive away evil.'

Note <span id="an_1:97:3:2">2</span>. 'Among them' seems to mean among
the liberal lords.'

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:97:8:1">1</span>. Cf. Lanman, p. 434.
