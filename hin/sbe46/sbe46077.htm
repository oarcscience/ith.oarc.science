<p>1. He who is inflamed after the primitive ordinances, is anointed with ointments&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:1:1">1</A>, the giver of all treasures, he whose hair is flame, whose stately robe is ghee, the purifier, skilled in sacrifice, Agni&#8212;that he may sacrifice to the gods.</p>  
<p>2. As thou hast performed, O Agni, the Hot<I>ri</I>'s duty for the Earth, as thou hast done it for Heaven, O <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, full of intelligence, in the same way sacrifice with this offering to the gods. Prosper this sacrifice to-day as thou hast done for Manus.</p>  
<p>3. Thou hast three lives, O <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, and three births from the Dawn&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:3:1">1</A>, O Agni! Being wise, sacrifice with these to the favour of the gods, and bring luck and welfare to the sacrificer.</p>  
<p>4. Praising Agni full of splendour, full of beauty, we adore thee, O <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, deserving to be magnified. Thee the gods have made their messenger, their steward&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:4:1">1</A>, and carrier of offerings, the navel of immortality.</p>  
<p>5. O Agni, the Hot<I>ri</I> who before thee was an excellent sacrificer, who verily&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:5:1">1</A> sat down and brought luck by himself&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:5:2">2</A> sacrifice according to his rules, O intelligent one, and set down our sacrifice at the feast of the gods.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The <I>Ri</I>shi is Kata Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;mitra, the metre Trish<I>t</I>ubh.&#8212;Verse 1 = TB. I, 2, 1, 10. Verse 3 = TB. III, 2, 11, 2;</p>  
<p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="green">p. 276</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> MS. IV, 11, 1; 12, 5. Verse 4 = TB. III, 6, 9, 1; MS. IV, 13, 5.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:17:1:1">1</A>. Possibly the poet intended to allude also to the other meaning of akt&uacute;bhi<I>h</I>, which means both 'ointments' and 'nights.' The nights render Agni conspicuous and anoint (a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>) him as it were with beauty. I do not believe that the existence of a Vedic word akt&uacute;, 'ointment,' should be denied; cf. Bechtel, Nachrichten d. G&ouml;ttinger Ges. d. Wiss. 1894, p. 398.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:17:3:1">1</A>. See Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, II, 14. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller translates: Three lives are thine, the dawns are thy three birthplaces, or three dawns are thy birthplaces.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:17:4:1">1</A>. See above, I, 58, 7, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:17:5:1">1</A>. Literally, 'doubly.' Grassmann is right in observing that the Vedic poets show a certain predilection for the word dvit&acirc;&acute; when speaking of Agni's being established and doing his work at the sacrifice. Prof. Max Muller thinks of Agni's two homes, earth and heaven.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:17:5:2">2</A>. On the Hot<I>ri</I> more ancient than Agni, comp. Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, I, 109. Probably this simply refers to the Agni or the fire used at former sacrifices.</p>
