### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 6.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 26–27.

1\. Bring forward, ye pious singers, stirred in your
thoughts [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:1:1), (the ladle) which is turned
towards the gods. Carrying (the sacrificial butter) from left to
right [2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:1:2) it turns eastward, rich in strength,
bringing the offering to Agni, full of ghee.

2\. When born thou hast filled the two worlds, nay thou hast even
exceeded them, O friend of sacrifices [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:2:1). May,
O Agni, thy seven-tongued horses [2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:2:2) move
along, by the greatness of heaven and
earth [3](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:2:3).

3\. Heaven and Earth the worshipful [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:3:1)
establish thee as Hot*ri* for the house, whenever the pious human tribes
offering food magnify the bright light.

4\. (Thou art) seated, the great one, in a firm
place [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:1), between the two mighty
Heavens [2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:2), thou who art longed for—(between)
the two united [3](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:3) never-ageing, inviolable
wives, the two juice-yielding milch-cows [4](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:4) of
the far-reigning one [5](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:4:5).

5\. Thy, the great (god's) laws, O Agni, are great. Through the power of
thy mind thou hast spread out the two worlds. Thou hast become a
messenger at thy birth, thou, O bull, the leader of the tribes.

6\. Or bind to the pole by means of thy (art of) harnessing the two
long-maned, red (horses) of *Ri*ta, that swim in
ghee [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:6:1), and carry hither, O god, all gods;
perform splendid worship, O *G*âtavedas!

7 [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:7:1). Even from heaven thy shining lights have
shone; thy splendour follows many resplendent dawns, when the gods, O
Agni, praised the cheerful Hot*ri*'s work [2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:7:2)
who eagerly burns in the forests [3](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:7:3).

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

8\. Whether it be the gods who rejoice in the wide air, or those who
dwell in the heavenly light, or those who are
helpful [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:8:1), ready to hear our call, and
worshipful; or whether the horses of thy chariot, O Agni, have turned
themselves hither—

9\. Come hither with them, O Agni, on one chariot or on many chariots,
for thy horses are powerful. Bring hither, after thy nature, the thirty
and the three gods with their wives, and rejoice (in the Soma).

10\. He is the Hot*ri* whose sacrifice even the two wide worlds salute
over and over again for the sake of prosperity. Turned to the
east [1](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:10:1), the two
well-established [2](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:10:2) (goddesses, Heaven and
Earth), the righteous, true ones stand as at the
sacrifice [3](sbe46066.htm#an_3:6:10:3) of (Agni) the right-born.

11 = III, 1, 23.

#### NOTES.

The sane *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 1 = TB. II, 8, 2, 5; MS. IV, 14, 3.
Verse 9 = AV. XX, 13, 4.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:6:1:1">1</span>. The translation of mananâ´ is
conjectural, and based only on the etymology. The passage â´t ít
râ´*g*ânam manánâ´*h* ag*ri*bh*n*ata, IX, 70, 3, does not help us much.
'Does not X, 47, 7. stómâ*h* h*ri*disp*rís*a*h* mánasâ va*k*yámânâ*h*,
indicate the original reading, mánasâ va*k*yámânâm?' M. M.

Note <span id="an_3:6:1:2">2</span>. The srû*k*a*h* are called
dakshi*n*âv*rí*ta*h*, I, 144, 1. By the word dakshi*n*âvâ´*t* the poet
probably intended to designate the ladle also as procuring a Dakshi*n*â
(sacrificial fee) to the priest.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:6:2:1">1</span>. On práya*g*yu, see M. M., vol.
xxxii, p. 335, and Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 98.

Note <span id="an_3:6:2:2">2</span>. The flames of Agni.

Note <span id="an_3:6:2:3">3</span>. Comp. below, 7, 10. The meaning
seems to be: by thy (Agni's) greatness which is equal to that of Heaven
and Earth.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:6:3:1">1</span>. I refer ya*gñ*íyâsa*h*, though it
is a plural, to Heaven and Earth. Comp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax,
103.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:6:4:1">1</span>. The Padapâ*th*a has dhruvá*h*. I
think it should be dhruvé, comp. II, 41, 5. dhruvé sádasi úttame …
âsâte; IX, 40, 2. dhruvé sádasi sîdati.

Note <span id="an_3:6:4:2">2</span>. I. e. Heaven and Earth.

Note <span id="an_3:6:4:3">3</span>. Â´skra seems derived from â-sa*k*
(Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 71).

Note <span id="an_3:6:4:4">4</span>. Or 'the two milch-cows which
instantly give milk,' if sabar- is to be connected with the Greek ἄφαρ;
comp. Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 17.

Note <span id="an_3:6:4:5">5</span>. Vish*n*u is not the only god who is
called urugâyá, and there is no reason therefore why the epithet should
not be referred here to Agni.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:6:6:1">1</span>. Comp. Lanman, Noun-Inflection, pp.
402, 413.—See below, IV, 2, 3.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:6:7:1">1</span>. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, I,
114 seq.

Note <span id="an_3:6:7:2">2</span>. Should the accent be ápa*h*? Comp.
III, 1, 3, note 3.

Note <span id="an_3:6:7:3">3</span>. It is very probable that u*s*ádhak
(comp. III, 34, 3; VII, 7, 2) is an epithet of Agni. We should expect
the genitive; u*s*ádhak, which violates the construction, seems

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

to stand metri causa. Or is u*s*ádhak an accusative singular neuter, so
that the literal translation would be: 'When the gods praised the work,
burning in the forests, of the Hot*ri*'?

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_3:6:8:1">1</span>. On û´ma, comp. Pischel, Vedische
Studien, I, 223.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_3:6:10:1">1</span>. Comp. above, II, 2, 7.

Note <span id="an_3:6:10:2">2</span>. See Windisch in the Festgruss an
Boehtlingk, p. 114.

Note <span id="an_3:6:10:3">3</span>. There is one syllable above the
number; the metre and meaning would be all right if we were to read
adhvaré (for adhvaréva): '(the two goddesses) stand at the sacrifice,'
&c. Prof. Max Müller explains: 'Adhvarâ´-iva, like two sacrifices, like
two sacrificial altars, barhis.'
