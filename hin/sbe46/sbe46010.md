### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 44.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 28–30.

1\. Agni, at the rising of the dawn [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:1:1.md) bring
splendid wealth, immortal *G*âtavedas, to the worshipper, (and bring
hither) to-day the gods awakening with the dawn.

2\. For thou art the accepted messenger, the bearer of sacrificial food,
O Agni, the charioteer of worship. United with the two A*s*vins and with
the Dawn bestow on us abundance of valiant heroes, and high glory.

 

3\. We choose to-day as our messenger Agni, the Vasu, the beloved of
many, whose banner is smoke, whose …  [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:3:1.md) is
light, at the dawning of the day, the beautifier of
sacrifices [2](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:3:2.md).

4\. I magnify at the dawning of the day Agni *G*âtavedas, the best, the
youngest guest, the best receiver of offerings, welcome to pious people,
that he may go to the gods [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:4:1.md).

 

5\. I shall praise thee, O food on which everything lives, immortal
one [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:5:1.md), Agni, the immortal protector, O holy
god, the best sacrificer, O bearer of sacrificial food.

6\. Be kind-spoken to him who praises thee, O youngest god,
honey-tongued, the best receiver of offerings. Lengthening Praska*n*va's
life, that he may reach old age, do homage [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:6:1.md)
to the host of the gods.

 

7\. The clans kindle thee, the all-possessing Hot*ri*:

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

therefore conduct hither speedily, much-invoked Agni, the provident
gods—

8\. Savit*ri*, the Dawn, the two A*s*vins, Bhaga,
Agni [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:8:1), at the dawning (of the day.md), (at the
end) of night [2](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:8:2.md). The Ka*n*vas, having
pressed Soma, inflame thee, the bearer of sacrificial food, O best
performer of worship.

 

9\. As thou, O Agni, art the lord of worship, the messenger of the
clans, conduct hither to-day the gods awakening with the dawn, of
sun-like aspect, that they may drink Soma.

10\. Agni, rich in splendour! thou hast shone after the former dawns,
visible to all. Thou art the guardian in the hamlets, the Purohita; thou
be-longest to men at the sacrifices [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:10:1.md).

 

11\. O Agni, let us put thee down (on the altar) as Manus did, O god, to
be the performer of the sacrifice, the Hot*ri*, the wise priest, the
quick immortal messenger.

12\. When thou, the Purohita of the gods, who art great like Mitra,
goest on thy errand as messenger in their midst, then the flames of Agni
shine like the roaring waves of the
Sindhu [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:12:1.md).

 

13\. Agni with thy attentive ears, hear me, together with the gods
driven (on their chariots) [1](sbe46010.htm#an_1:44:13:1.md) who accompany
thee. May Mitra and Aryaman sit down on the sacrificial grass, they who
come to the ceremony early in the morning.

14\. May the Maruts, they who give rain, the fire-tongued increasers of
*Ri*ta, hear my praise. May Varu*n*a, whose laws are firm, drink the
Soma, united with the two A*s*vins and with the Dawn!

#### NOTES.

The hymn is ascribed to Praska*n*va Kâ*n*va, who is the reputed author
of the whole group of the hymns, I, 44–50. It is certain that these
hymns really belong to a branch of the great Ka*n*va family, for which
the name Praska*n*va is characteristic. Comp. my Prolegomena, p. 260.

The metre is Bârhata Pragâtha. Verse 1 = SV. I, 40. Verses 1–2 = SV. II,
1130–1131. Verse 11 = TB. II, 7, 12, 6. Verse 13 = SV. I, 50; VS. 33,
15; TB. II, 7, 12, 5.

This Agni-hymn contains a number of allusions which show that it was
destined for the morning service. The same may be said of the next hymn,
I, 45, and of the whole collection of Praska*n*va hymns, which are
addressed exclusively to the devâ*h* prâtaryâvâ*n*a*h*, viz. Agni in his
special character as a matutinal deity, the two A*s*vins, the Dawn, the
rising Sun. From the mention of the Soma tiroahnya 45, 10; 47, 1, and
from other circumstances, Bergaigne has very ingeniously drawn the
conclusion that in the Praska*n*va collection an ancient
Â*s*vina*s*astra is preserved; see Recherches sur l’histoire de la
Liturgie Védique, 45.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:44:1:1">1</span>. I believe that the text, I may
perhaps not say requires, but very strongly invites, a slight
correction. The tradition gives ágne vívasvat ushása*h* *k*itrám
râ´dha*h* amartya. To connect vívasvat with râ´dha*h* and to make the
genitive ushása*h* depend on râ´dha*h* would give an expression which is
not, strictly speaking, impossible but in every case very unusual.
Nothing, on the other hand, is more frequent than combinations of the
locative of a noun derived from vi-vas with the genitive ushása*h*, 'at
the rising of the dawn' (ushása*h* vỹush*t*au, vỹush*t*ishu, vyúshi;
comp. the phrase vásto usrâ´*h* treated of by Kaegi, Festgruss an
Böhtlingk, 48; vásto*h* usrâ´*h*, Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beiträge,
XV, 185). I think that such

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

a phrase should be restored in our verse, and propose to read ágne
vivásvan ushása*h*, &c. The word vivásvan occurs in VIII, 102, 22. agním
îdhe vivásvabhi*h*. The expression used here would thus be similar to
that of III, 15, 2. tvám na*h* asyâ´*h* ushása*h* vỹush*t*au … bodhi
gopâ´*h*; comp. IV, 1, 5, &c.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:44:3:1">1</span>. The meaning of bhâ´*h*-*rig*îka is
quite uncertain. The accent would well agree with the explanation of the
word as a possessive compound; dhûmáketum bhâ´*h*-*rig*îkam would then
be exactly parallel: whose banner is smoke, whose *rig*îka is light. We
have then gó-*rig*îka as an epithet of Soma, 'he whose *rig*îka the cows
are,' i. e. 'whose *rig*îka is milk,' and âví*h*-*rig*îka as an epithet
of Dadhikrâvan ('he whose *rig*îka is visible'). All this taken together
is clearly insufficient for giving a result, and there is scarcely a
better prospect for etymological guesses. Bergaigne's (Rel. Véd., I,
206) translation of *rig*îka by 'flèche' would do for bhâ´*h*-*rig*îka,
but it is not very tempting in the cases of gó-*rig*îka and
âví*h*-*rig*îka. Roth (Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Ges. 48, 118) translates
'lichtglänzend.'

Note <span id="an_1:44:3:2">2</span>. Pischel's explanation of
adhvara*s*rî (Vedische Studien, I, 53, 'Zum Opfer kommend') does not
seem convincing to me.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:44:4:1">1</span>. Ludwig's translation 'dasz er die
götter herbringe' is not exact. As to the real meaning of our passage,
comp. VII, 9, 5. ágne yâhí dûtỹam … devâ´n á*kkh*a, 'Agni, go as a
messenger … to the gods.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:44:5:1">1</span>. Boehtlingk-Roth propose to read
am*ri*tabho*g*ana. I think the traditional text is right. Agni is called
vi*s*vasya bho*g*ana similarly, as it is said in I, 48, 10 (with regard
to Ushas), ví*s*vasya hí prâ´*n*anam *g*î´vanam tvé. Am*ri*ta may be
vocative s. neuter or masculine. Comp. Lanman, 339.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:44:6:1">1</span>. Benfey
(Quantitätsverschiedenheiten, IV, 2, 27) and Ludwig take namasyâ´ for a
first person.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:44:8:1">1</span>. If the accusative agním is right,
as it probably is, Agni would be invoked to conduct Agni to the
sacrifice. This is quite a possible idea. Comp. the formula of the
'devatânâm âvâhanam,' 'agnim agna âvaha, somam âvaha; agnim âvaha,'
i. e. Agni, conduct hither Agni, conduct hither Soma, conduct hither
Agni.' See Hillebrandt, Das Altindische Neu- und Vollmondsopfer, p. 84.

Note <span id="an_1:44:8:2">2</span>. Lanman, 482, takes kshápa*h* as an
acc. plur. I think it is gen. sing., and the accent should be kshapá*h*.
Comp. VIII, 19, 31; III, 49, 4, and the phrase aktó*h* vỹush*t*au.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:44:10:1">1</span>. Prof. Max Müller translates:
'Thou art the guardian in the hamlets, the chief-priest; thou art the
human chief-priest at the sacrifices.'

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_1:44:12:1">1</span>. With the third Pâda comp. IX, 50,
1, where it is said that the mighty strength of Soma shows itself
'síndho*h* ûrmé*h* iva svaná*h*,' i. e. 'like the roar of the waves of
the Sindhu.'

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_1:44:13:1">1</span>. I cannot follow the translation
of Dr. Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XVIII, 316.
