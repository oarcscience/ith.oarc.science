### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 15.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 15–16.

1\. Agni, the Hot*ri*, he who is a strong horse, is led around at our
sacrifice, the god worshipful among the gods.

2\. Agni goes thrice [1](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:2:1) around the sacrifice,
like a charioteer, conveying the enjoyment [2](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:2:2)
to the gods.

3\. Agni, the lord of booty, the sage, has circumambulated the
oblations, bestowing treasures on the worshipper.

 

4\. This (is the Agni) who is kindled in the front for Devavâta's son,
the S*riñg*aya [1](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:4:1), the brilliant (god), the
deceiver of foes.

5\. May the strong mortal be the master of this (god), of an Agni like
this, with sharp teeth and bountiful.

6 [1](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:6:1). Him they clean day by day like a racer
that wins (booty), like (Soma), the red young child of
Heaven [2](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:6:2).

7\. When Sahadeva's son, the prince, thought of me with two bay
horses [1](sbe46104.htm#an_4:15:7:1), I rose up like one who is called.

8\. And immediately I accepted from Sahadeva's son, the prince, those
adorable two bay horses which he offered me.

9\. May this prince Somaka, Sahadeva's son, live long, for your sake, O
divine A*s*vins!

10\. Give long life, O divine A*s*vins, to this son of Sahadeva, the
prince!

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Gâyatrî.—Verses 1–3 = TB. III, 6, 4, 1; MS. IV,
13, 4. Verse 3 = SV. I, 30; VS. XI, 25; TS. IV, 1, 2, 5; MS. I, 1, 9.

The first three verses are characterised by the constant allusions to
Agni's being carried around, and, in connection therewith, by the
frequent repetition of the preposition pari. Probably these verses
formed an independent T*rik*a-hymn, the position of which would be
according to the laws of arrangement of the Sa*m*hitâ; this T*rik*a
seems, consequently, to belong to the original collection of hymns. The
verses 4–10, on the other hand, or at least the verses 7–10, would seem
to be a later addition; the verses 4–6 can be considered as a T*rik*a
belonging to the original Sa*m*hitâ, though in this case it is difficult
to explain why the verses 7–10, which do not contain any reference to
Agni, have been inserted here at the end of the series of Agni hymns.
Another argument against the separation of the verses 4–6 from the rest
of the Sûkta is the mention of the prince S*riñg*aya in verse 4: verses
7–10 refer to a prince Somaka Sâhadevya, and we know from the Aitareya
Brâhma*n*a (VII, 34, cf. *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a II, 4, 4, 4) that this
prince also belonged to the S*riñg*aya tribe.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_4:15:2:1">1</span>. Cf. above, IV, 6, 4.

Note <span id="an_4:15:2:2">2</span>. I. e. the offering which the gods
enjoy.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_4:15:4:1">1</span>. This S*riñg*aya Daivavâta is
mentioned also in VI, 27, 7.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_4:15:6:1">1</span>. The first Pâda of this verse is
identical with the first Pâda of VIII, 102, 12.

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

Note <span id="an_4:15:6:2">2</span>. The red young child of Heaven
seems to be the Soma. The Soma frequently is called arushá ('red'), and
is said to be cleansed by men; in IX, 33, 5; 38, 5, the expression
divá*h* *s*í*s*u*h* ('the young child of Heaven') is used with regard to
him.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_4:15:7:1">1</span>. I. e. when he thought of
presenting me with the two horses.
