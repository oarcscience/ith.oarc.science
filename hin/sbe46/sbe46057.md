### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 7.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 28.

1\. Bring us, O youngest god, Bhârata [1](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:1:1),
Agni, the best, resplendent, much-desired wealth, O
Vasu [2](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:1:2)!

2\. May no malign power of a god or of a mortal overcome us. Help us
across such hostile power.

3\. And may we dive with thee across all hostile powers as across
streams of water.

4\. Bright, O purifier, worthy of adoration, Agni, thou shinest
mightily; thou hast been worshipped by offerings of
gh*ri*ta [1](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:4:1).

5\. Thou, O Bhârata [1](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:5:1), Agni! hast been
worshipped by us with offerings of heifers, of bulls, of eight-footed
(cows) [2](sbe46057.htm#an_2:7:5:2).

6\. The old excellent Hot*ri* who feeds on wood and drinks butter, he is
the wonderful son of strength.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 1 = TS. I, 3, 14, 3; MS. IV, 11, 4.
Verse 4 = TS. I, 3, 14, 5. Verse 6 = VS. XI, 70; TS. IV, 1, 9, 2; MS.
II, 7, 7.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:7:1:1">1</span>. Agni Bhârata is Agni as the
protector of the Bharata tribe or as invoked by that tribe.

Note <span id="an_2:7:1:2">2</span>. With the beginning of this verse,
I, 44, 4 should be compared.

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_2:7:4:1">1</span>. Comp. VIII, 19, 22. agní*h*
gh*ri*tébhi*h* â´huta*h*.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:7:5:1">1</span>. See verse 1, note 1.

Note <span id="an_2:7:5:2">2</span>. Roth (Petersb. Dictionary) supplies
vâgbhi*h* or *ri*gbhi*h*; comp. VIII, 76, 12. vâ´*k*am ash*t*â´padîm.
But there is no doubt that ash*t*â´padî, standing by the side of va*s*â´
and ukshán, has the same meaning as in the later ritual, viz. a cow with
calf.
