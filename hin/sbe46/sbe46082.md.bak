### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 22.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 22.

1\. This is that Agni with whom the desiring Indra took the pressed Soma
into his body. Having obtained thousandfold strength like a horse, a
racer [1](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:1:1.md), thou art praised, O *G*âtavedas!

2 [1](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:2:1.md). Thy splendour, O Agni, which dwells in
heaven and on earth, in the plants, O worshipful one, and in the waters,
wherewith thou hast spread through the wide air—that light of thine is
fierce, waving [2](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:2:2.md), man-beholding.

3\. Agni, thou goest to the floods of heaven. Thou hast spoken to the
gods who are liberal (?) [1](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:3:1). (Thou goest.md) to
the waters which (dwell) on high in the ether of the sun, and to those
which approach below.

4\. May the fires of the soil united with those on the
hill-sides [1](sbe46082.htm#an_3:22:4:1.md), without guile graciously
accept our sacrifice and plentiful food free from all plague.

5 = III, 1, 23.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is Trish*t*ubh, except in verse 4 which is
Anush*t*ubh.—A conjecture on the ritual use for which the hymn has been
composed, see in the note on verse 4.—Verses 1–5 = VS. XII, 47–51; TS.
IV, 2, 4, 2. 3; MS. II, 7, 11.—A sort of commentary on this hymn is
found in the *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a VII, 1, 1, 22 seq.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:22:1:1">1</span>. In the traditional text the words,
'a horse, a racer,' are accusatives. But it is the átya who attains

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (san) the vâ´*g*a
and who is called vâ*g*ín (comp. M. M., vol. xxxii, pp. 116, 442, and on
sápti, ibid. p. 102): see I, 130, 6; III, 2, 7; 38, 1 (V, 30, 14; IX,
93, 1; 96, 15, &c.); VII, 24, 5; IX, 43, 5; 82, 2; 85, 5; 86, 3; 96, 20;
X, 96, 10 (I, 52, 1, and III, 2, 3 do not contradict this). Pischel
(Vedische Studien, I, 105) believes that átyam ná stands for átya*h* ná,
which seems impossible to me. But I think that we should correct the
text and read átya*h* ná sápti*h*. The preceding accusatives have caused
the blunder.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:22:2:1">1</span>. Comp. Grassmann, Kuhn's
Zeitschrift, XVI, 165.

Note <span id="an_3:22:2:2">2</span>. Comp. ketú*h* ar*n*avá*h*
sû´ryasya, VII, 63, 2.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:22:3:1">1</span>. In the translation of dhísh*n*ya I
have followed Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 87, though this translation
is quite uncertain. Should the meaning be: 'the gods who dwell on the
dhish*n*ya altars'?

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:22:4:1">1</span>. Agni purîshya, i. e. the fire
dwelling in the soil (comp. Roth in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, 64), is
mentioned very frequently in the Mantras belonging to the Agni*k*ayana,
i. e. to the construction of the brick altar. Agni is considered as
residing in the soil used at that rite. Now in the Ya*g*us texts the
whole of our hymn occurs among the texts to be recited at the
Agni*k*ayana (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 2, 4, 2, &c.; comp. also Â*s*valâyana
*S*rautasûtra IV, 8, 20). Perhaps we may conjecture, therefore, that the
Agni*k*ayana rite in its simplest form was known already in the Rig-veda
period, and that our hymn was destined for it.—The prâva*n*a fires
(fires dwelling on the hill-sides) may be the fires dwelling in the
rivers which run down the prava*n*as or descents.
