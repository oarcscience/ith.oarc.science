### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 11.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 3.

1\. The guardian of people, the watchful one, Agni, the highly
dexterous, has been born, for the sake of new welfare. With gh*ri*ta on
his face, with his mighty, heaven-touching (light) he, the bright one,
brilliantly shines for the Bharatas.

2\. Agni, the beacon of sacrifice, the first
Purohita [1](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:2:1.md) men have kindled in the threefold
abode [2](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:2:2). (Driving.md) on the same chariot with
Indra and with the gods, he, the highly wise Hot*ri*, has sat down on
the Barhis for sacrificing.

3\. Though not cleansed, thou art born bright from thy two
mothers [1](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:3:1.md). Thou hast arisen as the
joy-giving sage belonging to Vivasvant [2](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:3:2.md)
They have strengthened thee by gh*ri*ta, O Agni, into whom oblations are
poured. Smoke, reaching the sky, has become thy beacon.

4\. May Agni straightway come to our sacrifice. Men carry Agni here and
there, house by house. Agni has become the messenger, the carrier of
oblations. Choosing Agni they choose a thoughtful (god).

5\. For thee, O Agni, is this sweetest speech, for thee this prayer; may
this one do thy heart good [1](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:5:1.md)! The prayers
fill thee with power and strengthen thee, like great rivers the Sindhu.

6\. Thee, O Agni, who wert hidden, dwelling here and there in every
wood, the Aṅgiras have discovered [1](sbe46115.htm#an_5:11:6:1.md). Thus
thou art born, produced by attrition, a mighty force. Thee, O Aṅgiras,
they call the son of strength.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Sutambhara Âtreya, the metre *G*agatî.—Verses I, 6, 2 =
SV. II, 257–259; TS. IV, 4, 4, 2–3. Verses 1, 6, 5 = MS. II, 13, 7.
Verses 1, 6 = VS. XV, 27–28. Verse 3 = TB. II, 4, 3, 3.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:11:2:1">1</span>. This Pâda is identical with the
first Pâda of X. 122, 4.

Note <span id="an_5:11:2:2">2</span>. The three sacrificial fires are
alluded to.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:11:3:1">1</span>. The two kindling-sticks.

Note <span id="an_5:11:3:2">2</span>. Vivásvata*h* is genitive, not
ablative, as Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 241, believes. Agni opens his
earthly career by doing service at the sacrifice of Vivasvant, i. e.
originally, in my opinion, the first man. Comp. H. O., Religion des
Veda, p. 122.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:11:5:1">1</span>. On the curious spelling manîshâ´
iyám in the Sa*m*hitâ text, instead of manî´sheyám, see the Rig-veda
Prâti*s*âkhya 163; H. O., Prolegomena, p. 386.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_5:11:6:1">1</span>. The ancestors of the priestly
tribes, being the first priests themselves, discover Agni.
