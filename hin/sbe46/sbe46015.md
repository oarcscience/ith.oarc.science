### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 65.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA. 9.

1 [1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:1). Thee who hidest thyself in secret like
a thief with an animal [2](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:2) (which he has
stolen)—who hadst harnessed [3](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:3) adoration and
carriedst adoration—

2\. The wise unanimously followed by thy
foot-marks [1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:2:1). All (gods) deserving worship
(reverentially) sat down near thee.

3\. The gods followed the laws of *Ri*ta. There was an encompassing as
the heaven (encompasses) the earth [1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:3:1).

4\. In the lap, in the womb of *Ri*ta, the waters nourish the fine child
with praise, him who is well born.

5\. Like good fortune, like a broad abode, like the fertile
hill [1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:5:1), like the refreshing stream,

6\. Like a racer urged forward in the race, like the rapids of the
Sindhu [1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:6:1)—who can hold him back?

7\. (He is) the kinsman of the rivers, as a brother of his sisters. He
eats the forests as a king (eats, i. e. takes the wealth of) the
rich [1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:7:1).

8\. When he has spread through the forests, driven by the wind, Agni
shears the hair of the earth.

9\. Sitting in the waters he hisses like a swan. (He is) most famous by
his power of mind, he who belongs to the clans, awakening at dawn—

10\. A performer of worship like Soma, the god born from *Ri*ta, like a
young (?) [1](sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:10:1) beast, far-extending,
far-shining.

#### NOTES.

The authorship of the whole collection, I, 65–73, is ascribed to
Parâ*s*ara *S*âktya. These hymns are addressed exclusively to Agni. The
greater part of them (65–70) is composed in the Virâ*g* metre; comp. on
this metre my Prolegomena, 95 seq. I have given there my reasons for
considering that each verse consists of twenty, not of forty syllables.

This section ascribed to Parâ*s*ara has been treated of by Bollensen,
Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XXII, 569 seq. No verse of these
hymns composed in the metre Dvipadâ Virâ*g* (I, 65–70) occurs in the
other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:65:1:1">1</span>. Professor Max Müller proposes the
following translation for verses 1 and 2: The wise (gods) together
followed thee (Agni) when in hiding, by means of footsteps, as one
follows a thief by the animal; they followed thee who accepts and
carries adoration (to the gods). All the worshipful gods sat down
(reverentially) near thee.

Note <span id="an_1:65:1:2">2</span>. There is no reason for reading
with Bartholomae (Studien zur indogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, 48)
pa*s*vâ´n (gen. plur.) ná tâyúm.

Note <span id="an_1:65:1:3">3</span>. Ludwig proposes yuvânám, which is
quite unnecessary.—See also Gaedicke, 173.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:65:2:1">1</span>. We have here the well-known myth
of the hidden Agni discovered by the gods. The 'wise ones,' (dhî´râ*h*)
are no doubt the searching gods, the same who are called yá*g*atrâ*h* in
the last Pâda, and who are expressly designated as devâ´*h* in verse 3.
Comp. Bergaigne, I, 110.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:65:3:1">1</span>. Regarding the construction, see
Gaedicke, 192.—Professor Max Müller's opinion on this phrase differs
from

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

mine. He writes: 'I should prefer parîsh*t*i. But parish*t*i seems to
mean a running about, reconnoitring, searching. "There was searching on
earth as in heaven," lit. earth, like heaven, was reconnoitring-ground.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:65:5:1">1</span>. Comp. VIII, 50, 2. girí*h* ná
bhu*g*mâ´. I believe that Boehtlingk-Roth, Bollensen, and Grassmann are
right in correcting our passage accordingly; ra*n*vâ´, p*ri*thvî´,
*s*ambhú follow the gender of the corresponding substantives, and the
same may be expected here. Comp. Lanman, 530. The meaning is that Agni
yields nourishment to all beings as a mountain fertilises the country by
the waters which come down from it; comp. VIII, 49, 2. giré*h* iva prá
rásâ*h* asya pinvire dátrâ*n*i purubaó*g*asa*h*.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:65:6:1">1</span>. Regarding the construction, comp.
Gaedicke, 252 seq.; Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier, 95. Joh. Schmidt (Die
Pluralbildungen der indogerm. Neutra, 305) and Ludwig (V, 524) are wrong
in taking kshóda*h* as a locative or as an instrumental respectively.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:65:7:1">1</span>. Comp. Pischel-Geldner, Vedische
Studien, I, p. xvi.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:65:10:1">1</span>. Can *s*í*s*vâ be the nominative
of a stem *s*í*s*van which stands by the side of *s*í*s*u as *rí*bhvan
of *ri*bhú? Prof. Max Müller proposes: 'Large like a cow with young,
like a pregnant cow.'
