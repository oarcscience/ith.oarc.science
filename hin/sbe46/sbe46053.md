### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 3.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 22–23.

#### ÂPRÎ HYMN.

1\. Agni being kindled, set down on the earth, has stood up with his
face towards all worlds. May the Hot*ri*, the purifier, the ancient,
wise one, may god Agni sacrifice to the gods, he who is worthy (of being
the sacrificer).

2\. Narâ*s*a*m*sa, anointing the abodes (of the sacrifice), equal by his
greatness to the three heavens, endowed with beautiful light, moistening
the offering, his mind being intent on scattering gh*ri*ta—may he anoint
the gods on the summit of sacrifice.

3\. Being magnified [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:3:1) in our mind, Agni,
sacrifice for us to-day to the gods before the human
(sacrificer) [2](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:3:2), thou who art worthy (of being
the sacrificer). Conduct hither the unshakable host of the Maruts.
Sacrifice, O men, to Indra who sits on the Barhis.

4\. O divine Barhis! On this (Barhis) which is large, rich in valiant
men, which has been spread on this Vedi (or sacrificial altar) rich in
gain, ready for wealth, which is anointed with gh*ri*ta, sit down, O
Vasus, O Vi*s*ve devâs, O Âdityas [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:4:1) worthy of
worship!

5\. May the divine doors which are easily passable, open themselves wide
when invoked with adoration. May they, the far-embracing, undecaying
ones, open wide, purifying our glorious
race [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:5:1) which is rich in valiant men.

6\. May Dawn and Night, grown strong from of

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

old, joyful like two birds (?) [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:6:1), (do) their
work well for us—they who weave, turned towards each other, the
stretched-out warp, the ornamented form of the
sacrifice [2](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:6:2), (the two goddesses) flowing with
plenty, rich in milk.

7\. May the two divine Hot*ri*s, the first ones, very knowing, very
marvellous, perform the sacrifice rightly with their (sacrificial)
verse. Sacrificing to the gods they anoint
(them) [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:7:1), observing the right time, on the
navel of the Earth, over the three ridges (of the three worlds).

8\. May Sarasvatî, the accomplisher of our prayer, may the goddess
I*l*â, all-victorious Bhâratî—may the three goddesses, according to
their wont, sit down on this Barhis and protect it, the faultless
shelter.

9\. Through (the god's) hearing (our prayer) a manly son is born (to
us), tawny-coloured, rich in gain, bringing vigour, loving the gods. May
Tvash*tri* deliver for us a son, the navel (i. e. the tie that binds
generations together), and may he then go to the abode of the gods.

10 [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:10:1). May the tree (i. e. the sacrificial
post) stand by, letting loose (the offering which goes to the gods). May
Agni make the offering ready in consequence of our prayers. May the
prescient divine butcher carry the thrice-anointed offering to the gods.

11\. He [1](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:11:1) is joined with
gh*ri*ta [2](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:11:2). His womb (on the altar) is
gh*ri*ta. He rests on gh*ri*ta. His abode is gh*ri*ta. Carry hither (the
gods) according to thy wont! Rejoice [3](sbe46053.htm#an_2:3:11:3)!
Carry, O bull, the offering, over which the Svâhâ has been spoken, (to
the gods).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Trish*t*ubh; verse 7: *G*agatî.—Verse 9 = TS.
III, 1, 11, 2; TB. II, 8, 7, 4; MS. IV, 14, 8. Verse 11 = VS. XVII, 88;
TÂ. X, 10, 2.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_2:3:3:1">1</span>. The text has î*li*tá*h*. Comp.
above, I, 1, 1, note 2.

Note <span id="an_2:3:3:2">2</span>. Comp. X, 53, I. ní hí sátsat (scil.
agní*h*) ántara*h* pû´rva*h* asmát.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_2:3:4:1">1</span>. It is very probable that the poet
intends to distinguish the Vasus, the Vi*s*ve devâs, and the Âdityas as
three categories of gods. But then we should expect the accent
â´dityâ*h*. Comp. VII, 51, 3. âdityâ´*h* ví*s*ve marûta*h* *k*a ví*s*ve
devâ´*h* *k*a ví*s*ve; X, 125, 1. ahám rudrébhi*h* vásubhi*h* *k*arâmi
ahám â´dityaí*h* utá vi*s*vádevai*h*.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:3:5:1">1</span>. Comp. the G*ri*hya Mantra addressed
to the Mekhalâ, of which it is said 'var*n*am pavitram punatî na*h*
âgât,' *S*âṅkhâyana G*ri*hya II, 2, 1, &c.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_2:3:6:1">1</span>. The meaning of vayỹa (comp. IX; 68,
8) is uncertain. Possibly it is derived from ví, 'the bird.' According
to Sâya*n*a it would mean 'weavers' (vânaku*s*ale iva). Vayỹeva may be
vayỹe iva (dual feminine), in spite of the artificial theory of the
Prag*ri*hya vowels; see Lanman, p. 361; H. O., Hymnen des Rig-veda, I,
456. Or it may be vayỹâ iva, dual masculine or singular feminine (comp.
VII, 2, 6).

Note <span id="an_2:3:6:2">2</span>. Comp. VII, 42, 1. adhvarásya
pé*s*a*h*.

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_2:3:7:1">1</span>. Comp. VIII, 39, 1. agní*h* devâ´n
anaktu na*h*.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_2:3:10:1">1</span>. With the first hemistich compare
especially, III, 4, 10 (see below).

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_2:3:11:1">1</span>. 'He' of course is Agni.

Note <span id="an_2:3:11:2">2</span>. Differing from M. M., vol. xxxii,
p. 185, I take gh*ri*tam as an accusative.

Note <span id="an_2:3:11:3">3</span>. Comp. III, 6, 9 (see below).
