### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 94.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 6, VARGA 30–32.

1\. We have sent forward [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:1:1.md) with thoughtful
mind this song of praise like a chariot to the worthy *G*âtavedas. For
blissful is his care for us in his companionship. Agni! May we suffer no
harm in thy friendship.

2\. He prospers for whom thou performest the sacrifice; he dwells
untouched [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:2:1.md); he acquires abundance of
heroes. He is strong; no distress overtakes him. Agni! May we suffer no
harm in thy friendship.

3\. May we be able to light thee. Prosper our prayers. The gods eat the
sacrificial food that is offered in thee. Bring thou hither the Âdityas,
for we long for them. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.

4\. Let us bring fuel and prepare sacrificial gifts for thee, awaking
thy attention at each joint [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:4:1.md) (of the
month). Help forward our prayers that we may live. Agni! May we suffer
no harm in thy friendship.

5\. (He is) the shepherd of the clans [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:5:1.md); by
his nightly light the creatures walk, the two-footed and four-footed.
Thou art the bright, great splendour of dawn. Agni! May we suffer no
harm in thy friendship.

6\. Thou art the Adhvaryu and the ancient Hot*ri*, the
Pra*s*âst*ri* [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:6:1.md), the Pot*ri*, the born
Purohita [2](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:6:2.md). Knowing the duties of every
priest thou givest

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

success, O wise one. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.

7\. Thou who art beautiful, of like appearance on all sides, thou
shinest forth even when afar like lightning. Thou seest, O god, even
over the darkness of night. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy
friendship.

8\. May the chariot of him who presses Soma, be to the
front [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:8:1.md), O gods. May our curse overcome the
malicious ones. Accept (O gods) this prayer and make it prosper. Agni!
May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.

9\. Strike away with thy weapons those who curse us, the malicious ones,
all ghouls, be they near or afar. And make a good path to the sacrifice
of him who praises thee. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.

10\. When thou hast yoked to thy chariot the two ruddy, red horses, whom
the wind drives forward, and thy roaring is like that of a bull, then
thou movest the trees with thy banner of
smoke [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:10:1.md). Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy
friendship.

11\. And when thy grass-consuming sparks are scattered, the winged
(birds) [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:11:1.md) also fear the noise. Then all
goes well with thee and thy chariots. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy
friendship.

12\. He makes Mitra and Varu*n*a get refreshing drink. He mysteriously
turns away the anger of the Maruts [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:12:1.md). Be
merciful towards us. May their mind be again (as it was before). Agni!
May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.

13\. Thou art god of the gods, a wonderful Mitra (i. e. friend, of the
gods) [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:13:1.md). Thou art the Vasu

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

of the Vasus, welcome at the sacrifice. May we be under thy most
wide-reaching protection. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.

14\. That is thy glorious (nature) that when kindled in thy own house,
and fed with Soma, thou art awake [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:14:1.md), the
most merciful one. Thou bestowest treasures and wealth on the
worshipper. Agni! May we suffer no harm in thy friendship.

15\. May we be of those to whom thou, O possessor of beautiful wealth, O
Aditi [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:15:1.md), art pleased to grant sinlessness
in health and wealth [2](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:15:2.md), and whom thou wilt
quicken with glorious strength and with abundance of progeny.

16\. Do thou, O Agni, thou who knowest (how to grant) happiness, prolong
our life here, O God! May Mitra and Varu*n*a grant us this, may Aditi,
the Sindhu, the Earth, and the Sky [1](sbe46030.htm#an_1:94:16:1.md)!

#### NOTES.

This hymn with the whole collection which it opens is ascribed to Kutsa
Âṅgirasa. The metre is *G*agatî; the two last verses, as is frequently
the case in *G*agatî-hymns (see H. O., Prolegomena, 144 seq.), are
composed in Trish*t*ubh. The hymn has been translated by Prof. Max
Müller, Physical Religion, p. 173.—Verse 1 = MS. II, 7, 3; SV. I, 66;
AV. XX, 13, 3. Verses I, 3, 4 = SV. II, 414. 416. 415.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:94:1:1">1</span>. Prof. Max Müller translates, 'Let
us build up this hymn of praise.' To me it rather seems that the reading
should be, as Boehtlingk-Roth have proposed, s. v. sam-hi, sám ahema.
Comp. I, 61, 4. asmai ít u stómam sám

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

hinoini rátham ná tásh*t*â-iva, 'to him I send forward a song of praise
as a carpenter (fits out) a chariot.' Compare besides, IX, 71, 5; I,
184, 4; II, 19, 7; VI, 45, 14, &c.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:94:2:1">1</span>. Comp. vol. xxxii, p. 65, I, 37, 1
note.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:94:4:1">1</span>. Párvan, 'joint,' seems to refer
here, as it very frequently does in the later Vedic and post-Vedic
texts, to the joints of the month, the sacrificial days of the full and
change of the moon (the pârva*n*a-sacrifices). As to the temporal use of
the instrumental, comp. *ri*tunâ and *ri*tubhi*h*; Delbrück, Altindische
Syntax, p. 130.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:94:5:1">1</span>. Ludwig proposes the correction of
vi*s*â´m gopâ´*h* into vi*s*â´m gopá*h* (genitive). But I think it will
be sufficient to write asyá accented. As to vi*s*â´m gopâ´*h*, comp. 96,
4.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:94:6:1">1</span>. The Pra*s*âst*ri* (or
Upavakt*ri*), literally, 'the commander,' is the same priest who is more
usually designated as the Maitrâvaru*n*a. All the priests mentioned here
(with the exception of the Purohita, see next note) belong to the
ancient system of the 'seven Hot*ri*s,' enumerated, for instance, II, 1,
2. Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 383 seq.

Note <span id="an_1:94:6:2">2</span>. The Purohita or house-priest does
not, properly speaking, belong to the number of the priests officiating
at a sacrifice (*ri*tvi*g*a*h*), though of course the Purohita could act
as a *ri*tvi*g*. Geldner (Vedische Studien, II, 144) seems to be wrong
in concluding from our passage that 'already in the Rig-veda the
Purohita, being the superintendent of the holy service, was a real
*ri*tvi*g*, i. e. officiating priest.' Comp. H. O., loc. cit., 374 Seq.;
379, note 2.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:94:8:1">1</span>. On pû´rva*h*, comp. I, 34, 10; V,
31, 11.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:94:10:1">1</span>. The regular accentuation of a
determinative compound ('banner of smoke') would be dhûmaketúnâ. But it
is very natural that the traditional text gives the accent of the
Bahuvrîhi ('he whose banner is smoke') which so frequently occurs.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_1:94:11:1">1</span>. As to patatrí*n*a*h*, comp.
above, I, 58, 5.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_1:94:12:1">1</span>. Most probably the meaning is not
that the Maruts are expected to turn away the anger of somebody else,
but that the anger of the Maruts shall be turned away by Agni, Comp. I,
171, I; VI, 66, 5; VII, 58, 5; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, II, 401. It
seems, consequently, that we should read avayâtâ´.—On ávayâtahe*l*â*h*,
scil. Indra, see vol. xxxii, p. 292 (I, 171, 6), and also IV, 1, 4; VI,
66, 5.

The genitives Mitrásya Váru*n*asya may be understood as depending,
together with Marútâm, on hé*l*a*h*. In this case the translation would
be: 'He mysteriously turns away the anger of Mitra and Varu*n*a and of
the Maruts in order that (men) may get refreshing drink.'

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_1:94:13:1">1</span>. On the frequent identification of
Agni with Mitra, see Bergaigne, Religion Védique, III, 134 seq.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_1:94:14:1">1</span>. On the root *g*ar used with
regard to Agni, see the remarks of Dr. Neisser in Bezzenberger's
Beiträge, XIII, 297 seq.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

##### Verse 15.

Note <span id="an_1:94:15:1">1</span>. Agni is invoked here by the name
of Aditi, with an evident allusion to the goddess Aditi, as granting
freedom from bonds, which is the original meaning of Aditi. Comp. M. M.,
vol. xxxii, pp. 241, 260, 262; H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 204.

Note <span id="an_1:94:15:2">2</span>. Comp. III, 54, 19. On sarvátât
(sarvátâti), see M. M.’s note, vol. xxxii, p. 260, note a, and compare
Darmesteter, Haurvatâ*t* et Ameretâ*t*, p. 80. See also Lanman, p. 386.

##### Verse 16.

Note <span id="an_1:94:16:1">1</span>. The last hemistich is the regular
conclusion of the Kutsa hymns.
