### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 96.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 7, VARGA 3–4.

1\. Being born by strength [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:1:1.md) in the ancient
way, lo! he (Agni) has assumed instantly all the qualities of a sage.
The Waters and the Dhisha*n*â [2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:1:2.md) have
furthered the friend (Mitra [3](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:1:3).md). The gods
have held Agni as the giver of wealth.

2\. By the ancient Nivid [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:2:1.md), by
Âyu's [2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:2:2.md) wisdom he has procreated these
children of men. With his irradiating look [3](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:2:3.md)
(he has procreated) the Sky and the Waters. The gods have held Agni as
the giver of wealth.

3\. The Âryan clans magnified [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:3:1.md) him as the
first performer of sacrifices, as receiving offerings, as striving
forward, the son of strength, the Bharata [2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:3:2.md),
the bestower of mighty rain (?) [3](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:3:3.md). The gods
have held Agni as the giver of wealth.

4\. He, Mâtari*s*van [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:4:1.md), the lord of
bountiful prosperity, has found a path for (his?) offspring, he who has
found the sun, the shepherd of the clans, the begetter of the two
worlds. The gods have held Agni as the giver of wealth.

5\. Night and Dawn, who constantly destroy each other's appearance,
suckle one young calf [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:5:1.md)
unitedly [2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:5:2.md). The piece of
gold [3](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:5:3.md) shines between Heaven and Earth. The
gods have held Agni as the giver of wealth.

6\. (He is) the base of wealth, the assembler of all
goods [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:6:1.md), the beacon of sacrifice, the
fulfiller of thought, the bird [2](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:6:2.md). In order
to guard their immortality

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

the gods have held him, Agni, as the giver of wealth.

7\. Him who is now and who was formerly the abode of wealth, the
earth [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:7:1.md) (i. e. the dwelling-place or
support) of what is born and of what will be born, the shepherd and
guardian of what is and of much that comes into being. The gods have
held Agni as the giver of wealth.

8\. May (Agni,) the giver of wealth, present us with quick wealth. May
the giver of wealth (present us with wealth) united with strong
men [1](sbe46032.htm#an_1:96:8:1). The giver of wealth (should grant us.md)
food together with valiant heroes. The giver of wealth should grant us
long life.

9 = 95, 11.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verses 1, 2 = MS. IV, 10, 6. Verse 5 = VS.
XII, 2; XVII, 70; TS. IV, 1, 10, 4; 6, 5, 2; 7, 12, 3; MS. II, 7, 8.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:96:1:1">1</span>. I. e. by the attrition of the
woods, as sáhasa*h* putrá*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:96:1:2">2</span>. Two new discussions on dhishá*n*â
have been given by Hillebrandt (Ved. Mythologie, I, 175 seq.; comp. the
criticisms of Ludwig, Ueber die neuesten arbeiten auf dem gebiete der
Ṛgveda-forschung, 85 seq.) and Pischel (Ved. Studien, II, 82 seq.).
Hillebrandt arrives at the conclusion that dhishá*n*â is the Earth (in
the dual, Heaven and Earth; in the plural, Heaven. Air, and Earth), and
besides the Vedi, i. e. the excavated spot of ground which serves as a
kind of altar for the sacrifice. Similar is

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pischel's opinion.
He believes that the singular dhishá*n*â is everywhere to be interpreted
as a proper name: the name of a goddess of wealth and prosperity. The
dual dhishá*n*e means 'Heaven and Earth:' thus the original meaning of
dhishá*n*â must have been, as Pischel concludes, either Heaven or Earth.
He tries to show that it is Earth, and so does Prof. Hillebrandt. The
goddess of wealth originally was a goddess of the earth conceived as the
liberal giver of wealth. This goddess, Prof. Pischel thinks, was closely
related to, or even identical with, the goddess Aditi, whom the same
scholar also believes to be a personification of the Earth.

I must confess that even this close agreement of these two distinguished
scholars has failed to convince me. It is quite true that the dual
dhishá*n*e means Heaven and Earth, and it is possible that the singular
may, at least in some passages, mean the Earth. But I cannot believe
that this is the original meaning of the word. Originally, in my
opinion, dhishá*n*â was an implement used at the sacrifice, more
especially at the Soma sacrifice. The ádrî (Soma-stones) are said to
rest in the lap of the dhishá*n*â (I, 109, 3). In a Ya*g*us Mantra
referring to the sacrificial preparation of Soma (Vâ*g*asaneyi Sa*m*hitâ
VI, 26) the dhishá*n*â, or more exactly the Dhishá*n*âs, as goddesses
(dhishá*n*â*s* *k*a devî´*h*), are mentioned together with the
sacrificial fire, the waters, and the grâ´vâ*n*a*h*, the stones. In a
similar connection we find a Ya*g*us formula pronounced when the
Adhvaryu began to beat the Soma plants with the Upâ*ms*usavana stone
(see Weber, Indische Studien, X, 370). There the Soma was addressed
first, and then the two Dhisha*n*âs: 'Do not be afraid, do not be
terrified, assume sap (O Soma!). O two Dhisha*n*âs! Being firm show
firmness!' (Vâ*g*asaneyi Sa*m*hitâ VI, 35). Here the *S*atapatha
Brâhma*n*a (III, 9, 4, 18) says, that some authorities refer the last
words to the two boards (phalake) on which the pressing-stones rest (see
Hillebrandt, Ved. Mythologie, I, 149 seq.). But the author of the
Brâhma*n*a himself declares that Heaven and Earth are addressed; for as
to the boards

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

used for pressing the Soma, it would be of no consequence if they were
broken.—Other passages in which the dhishá*n*â*h* are mentioned in
connection with the preparation of the Soma, are Rig-veda IX, 59, 2; X,
17, 2. In the last passage the lap of the Dh.' is mentioned as in I,
109, 3 (see above). The dhishá*n*â was anointed, I, 102, 1. The
dhishá*n*â is mentioned in connection with the waters which were fetched
by the Adhvaryus and used at the sacrifice, X, 30, 6, and in connection
with the sacrificial fire, III, 2, 1, and in our passage. I have
therefore no doubt that according to the original meaning the Dhisha*n*â
was, as stated above, a sacrificial implement used chiefly, though not
exclusively, at the pressing of the Soma. I do not venture to determine
the exact nature of this implement, but I think that from the passages
collected above it will be evident that it was a sort of support on
which the pressing-stones rested. A similar support may have been used
for the vessel containing the sacrificial water, and for the sacrificial
fire. This support was considered as yielding the Soma to Indra, as
strengthening Indra, as inciting Indra and the gods to liberality
towards men. Thus we have a goddess Dhisha*n*â who wears the aspect of a
goddess of wealth. She is invoked as one of the Gnâs in I, 22, 10 with
Hotrâ Bhâratî. Finally the Earth, the support of everything, was likened
to this support of the pressing-stones and of the Soma; and Heaven and
Earth were then considered as the two Dhisha*n*âs.

Note <span id="an_1:96:1:3">3</span>. Comp. above, 94, 13, note 1.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:96:2:1">1</span>. On the solemn formulas of
invocation, called Nivids, see Haug's Aitareya Brâhma*n*a, p. 32 seq.;
Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 355; H. O., Religion des Veda, 387, note 2.
Of course, the Nivids which *S*âṅkhâyana (*S*rautasûtra VIII, 16–25)
gives, cannot be those to which the poets of the Rig-veda several times
allude.

Note <span id="an_1:96:2:2">2</span>. On Âyu as one of the mythical
ancestors of

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

mankind, nearly related to Manu, see Bergaigne, Religion Védique, I, 59
seq.

Note <span id="an_1:96:2:3">3</span>. Ushas is called vivásvatî, III,
30, 13 (cf. Bergaigne, I, 86); we are justified, consequently. in
translating vivásvatâ *k*ákshasâ, 'with the irradiating look.' But in
giving this translation we should not forget that the poet no doubt at
the same time intended to allude to the name of Vivasvat, the father of
Yama.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:96:3:1">1</span>. The text has î*l*ata. Comp. above,
I, 1, 1, note 2.

Note <span id="an_1:96:3:2">2</span>. Agni seems to be called Bharatá as
belonging to the people of Bharatas. Comp. H. O., 'Buddha, sein Leben,
seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde' (first edition), p. 414 seq. More usually
Agni is designated as Bhâ´rata.

Note <span id="an_1:96:3:3">3</span>. S*ri*prádânum. On dâ´nu, the
meaning of which I consider to be 'rain' or the like, comp. the
discussion of Prof. Max Müller, vol. xxxii, 113 seq. The exact meaning
of s*ri*prá, which should not be compared with the Greek λιπαρός, cannot
be determined. The etymology is a very unsafe guide in such questions,
and neither the connection with the root s*ri*p, 'to creep,' 'to crawl,'
nor with the noun sarpís, 'butter,' seems to lead to a satisfactory
result. The passages in which s*ri*prá or compounds of this adjective
occur, point to a meaning like 'great,' 'mighty,' 'fine.' Thus
s*ri*prábho*g*as seems to be something like purubhó*g*as or subhó*g*as;
Indra's arms (karásna) are called both s*ri*prá (VIII, 32, 10) and
p*ri*thú (VI, 19, 3); finally s*ri*prádânu, which is used here as an
epithet of Agni, and VIII, 25, 5 of Mitra and Varu*n*a, does not seem to
differ very much from sudâ´nu.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:96:4:1">1</span>. Mâtari*s*van, the messenger of
Vivasvat, who carried the fire from heaven to earth, was originally
distinct from Agni, but is identified with him in several passages. See
M. M., Physical Religion, p. 152; Bergaigne. Religion Védique, I; 52
seq.; H. O., Religion des Veda, 122.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:96:5:1">1</span>. Comp. above, 95, 1, and I, 113, 2.
rú*s*advatsâ. The calf, of course, is Agni.

Note <span id="an_1:96:5:2">2</span>. Literally, 'turned towards each
other.'

Note <span id="an_1:96:5:3">3</span>. The gold is again Agni.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:96:6:1">1</span>. The first Pâda is identical with
X, 139, 3.

Note <span id="an_1:96:6:2">2</span>. I prefer with Ludwig to take vé*h*
as a nominative (comp. Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 375) instead of a
genitive.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:96:7:1">1</span>. Compare the very obscure verse X,
31, 5. iyám sâ´ bhûyâ ushásâm iva kshâ´*h*, 'may she be the earth, as it
were, of the dawns.' 'She' may possibly be the earth, which would be
designated here as a dwelling-place or support of the dawns.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:96:8:1">1</span>. Prof. Max Müller proposes another
translation of sánara. He writes: 'One expects an opposition between
turá and sánara. Sánara can hardly be the same as vîrávat in the next
line. I should like to take sánara as a variety of sána and sanâtána.
Give us fleeting, i. e. daily wealth, and give us old, i. e. lasting
wealth!'
