### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 146.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 15.

1\. I praise Agni who has three heads and seven rays (or
reins) [1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:1:1), who is without flaw, sitting in
the lap of his parents [2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:1:2) and of whatever
moves or is firm, who has filled (with his light) all the lights of
Heaven.

2\. The big bull has grown up to them [1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:2:1);
the ageless one who from here (from this world) distributes his
blessings, the tall has stood up erect. He puts down his feet on the
surface of the wide (Earth); his red ones [2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:2:2)
lick the udder (the cloud?).

3\. Walking towards their common calf the two
well-established [1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:3:1)
milch-cows [2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:3:2) walk about in different
directions. They measure interminable paths; they have invested
themselves with all great desires.

4\. Wise poets [1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:1) follow his
track [2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:2) who in manifold ways protect the
ageless one with their hearts. Wishing to acquire him they have searched
the river [3](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:3). He the
Sun [4](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:4) became visible to them, to the
men [5](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:4:5).

5\. He is worthy to be looked for, round about in his race-courses, the
noble who is to be magnified [1](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:5:1), the great
one [2](sbe46044.htm#an_1:146:5:2), in order that the small may live, as
he, the all-visible liberal lord, has become a progenitor for those
germs in many places.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is Trish*t*ubh.—No verse occurs in the other
Sa*m*hitâs.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:146:1:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a refers the three heads
of Agni to the three Savanas, or the three worlds, or the three
sacrificial fires. The last explanation seems to be most probable. The
seven reins (rays) are, according to Sâya*n*a, the seven metres or the
seven flames of Agni. The last explanation is recommended by III, 6, 2
(see below). But it is possible also to think of the seven priests
(sapta hotâra*h*).—Comp. II, 5, 2 (see below), and Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ I,
5, 3, 2 (to which passage Ludwig refers): saptá te agne samídha*h* saptá
*g*ihvâ´*h* saptá *rí*shaya*h* saptá dhâ´ma priyâ´*n*i, &c.

Note <span id="an_1:146:1:2">2</span>. The parents are Heaven and Earth.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:146:2:1">1</span>. The text has the dual feminine;
no doubt Heaven and Earth are meant.

Note <span id="an_1:146:2:2">2</span>. The horses or flames of Agni.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:146:3:1">1</span>. On su-méka, comp. the article of
Prof. Windisch in Festgruss an Böhtlingk, p. 114.

Note <span id="an_1:146:3:2">2</span>. The cows seem to be Night and
Dawn; comp. above, I, 95, 1; 96, 5. Night and Dawn are called suméke, I,
113, 3.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:146:4:1">1</span>. The priests.

Note <span id="an_1:146:4:2">2</span>. I have translated padám nayanti
in the way indicated by Atharva-veda XI, 2, 13. viddhásya padanî´*h*iva;
comp. also Manu VIII, 44. Prof. Max Muller translates, 'Wise poets lead
(Agni) to the ageless place, keeping many things in their heart—or, lead
the ageless Agni to his place (the sacrifice).'

Note <span id="an_1:146:4:3">3</span>. They have tried to find Agni in
his proper dwelling, in the water.

Note <span id="an_1:146:4:4">4</span>. The Sun is here identified with
Agni.

Note <span id="an_1:146:4:5">5</span>. On the form n*rî´*n standing for
different cases,

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

compare Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 430; Bergaigne, Religion Védique, I,
136, note 1; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 42, and Göttinger Gel.
Anzeigen, 1890, p. 541 seq.; Hillebrandt, Zeitschrift der Deutschen
Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 420. Here it seems most natural to take
n*rî´*n, as Pischel has proposed, as standing for the dative plural.
Bartholomae (Studien zur indogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, 118,
comp. p. 48), referring to III, 14, 4, believes that n*rî´*n (or, more
correctly, \*n*rî´*m), both here and there is genitive plural, and that
Agni is called 'the sun of men' because men are able to light this sun
themselves. To me it seems very doubtful that this is a Vedic idea, and
as to the verse III, 14, 4, I believe that n*rî´*n there is a regular
accusative plural: Agni is called there, 'a sun that spreads out men
over their dwellings.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:146:5:1">1</span>. Î*l*énya*h*. Comp. I, 1, 1, note
2.

Note <span id="an_1:146:5:2">2</span>. Agni may be called mahá*h*, 'the
great one.' But it seems more natural to read mahé, the ancient
pronunciation of which word before a word commencing with a vowel
(mahá’) coincided, or nearly coincided, with that of mahá*h*. The
translation then would be: 'he who is to be magnified in order that the
great and the small may live.'
