### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 128.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 14–45.

1\. He was born in Manu's firm law [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:1:1.md), the
Hot*ri*, the best sacrificer, according to the will of the
U*s*i*g*s [2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:1:2.md), Agni, according to his own
will. Always listening to him who wishes to be his friend, like a
treasure to him who aspires to renown, the unbeguiled Hot*ri* sat down
in the abode of food (on the altar);
enveloped [3](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:1:3) (he sat down.md) in the abode of
food.

2\. We render him attentive [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:2:1.md), the promoter
of sacrifice, on the path of *Ri*ta, by adoration with offerings, in the
divine world, by (adoration) with offerings
 [2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:2:2.md). In bringing us vigour he never becomes
worn out with this body of his: he whom Mâtari*s*van (has brought) to
Manu from afar, the god whom he has brought from afar.

3\. In his (own) way he moves in one moment round the terrestrial
(space), the sudden devourer (emitting) his sperm, the bellowing bull
emitting his sperm, the bellower [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:3:1.md), looking
round with a hundred eyes, the god who quickly courses in the
forests [2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:3:2.md), taking his seat on the lower
ridges, Agni, and on the highest ridges.

4\. This highly wise Purohita, Agni watches sacrifice and
service [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:4:1) house by house; by (the power of.md)
his mind he is intent upon sacrifice. By (the power of) his mind helpful
to him who desires food [2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:4:2.md), he looks on all
creatures, since he has been born, the guest adorned with ghee, (since)
the helpful carrier (of the gods) [3](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:4:3.md) has
been born.

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

5\. When through his (Agni's) power the bounties grow in strength, with
the roar of Agni [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:5:1.md) as with that of the
Maruts [2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:5:2.md)—like bounties offered to a
vigorous man: then he by his greatness stirs up the gift of goods. May
he protect us from misfortune and injury, from evil spell and injury.

6\. The far-reaching [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:1.md)
steward [2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:2.md) has taken all
goods [3](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:3.md) in his right hand, and strongly
advancing does not let them loose; desirous of glory he does not let
them loose. For every supplicant [4](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:4.md) thou
hast carried the oblations to the gods [5](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:5.md).
For every righteous one he procures a treasure; Agni opens both folds of
the door (for him).

7\. He has been established as the most blissful one in the enclosures
of men, Agni, at the sacrifices, like a noble lord of the clans, a
beloved lord of the clans at the sacrifices: he rules over the oblations
of men to which nourishing power has been
imparted [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:7:1.md). May he protect us from harm
that comes from Varu*n*a, from harm [2](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:7:2.md) that
comes from the great god.

8\. They magnify Agni the Hot*ri*, the dispenser of goods. They have
roused the beloved, the most shining
steward [1](sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:8:1) (of sacrifice.md); they have roused
the carrier of oblations. The gods desirous of goods (have roused) him
in whom all life dwells, who possesses all wealth, the Hot*ri*, the
worshipful sage, the lovely one for the sake of bliss; with praises
(they have roused), desirous of goods, the lovely one.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 6 = TB. II, 5, 4, 4.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:128:1:1">1</span>. As to dhárîma*n*i, comp. IX, 86,
4, where it is said that the streams of Soma flow forward,
'dhárîma*n*i;' Bergaigne, III, 219. 'Domain, precinct, sanctuary?' M. M.

Note <span id="an_1:128:1:2">2</span>. The U*s*i*g*as (comp. above, I,
60, 2, note 1) are closely related to the Bh*ri*gus; they are considered
as the first sacrificers, the first worshippers of Agni. See Bergaigne,
I, 57 seq.

Note <span id="an_1:128:1:3">3</span>. Enveloped in fuel and libations.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:128:2:1">1</span>. Comp. M. M.’s note, vol. xxxii,
p. 437.

Note <span id="an_1:128:2:2">2</span>. Comp. Lanman, pp. 516, 518.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:128:3:1">1</span>. Prof. Max Müller translates the
second and third Pâdas: 'again and again shouting, bellowing forth his
sperm, yea, placing his sperm with bellowing.'

Note <span id="an_1:128:3:2">2</span>. Of course the fuel is alluded to.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:128:4:1">1</span>. Ya*gñ*ásya adhvarásya, 'sacrifice
and service;' comp. above, I, 1, 4, note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:128:4:2">2</span>. The translation is doubtful. If
the denominative ishûy is derived from íshu, the meaning must be 'to fly
like an arrow,' or possibly 'to shoot arrows.' But I do not think that
the poet can have meant to say that Agni acts as a vedhâ´*h* and looks
on all creatures 'for him who flies like an arrow,' or 'for him who
shoots arrows.' We should rather have to write ishûyate without accent,
so that the translation would be: 'By (the power of) his mind helpful
(Agni) flies like an arrow; he looks on all creatures' (comp. VI, 3, 5,
where it is said that Agni shoots arrows). But possibly ishûy, which is
found only here, may be a synonym of ishudhy, see verse 6. It may be a
denominative from ish, influenced by the type of verbs like *rig*ûy,
kratûy,

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

vasûy, &c. Then the accent can be retained, and the translation would be
as given in the text ('to him who desires food').

Note <span id="an_1:128:4:3">3</span>. On váhni, comp. above, I, 127, 8,
note 1.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:128:5:1">1</span>. The cerebral *n* in ave*n*a
clearly points to the correction of the text agné*h* ráve*n*a.

Note <span id="an_1:128:5:2">2</span>. The Maruts are called
bho*g*â´*h*, V, 53, 16 (stuhí bho*g*â´n, 'praise the liberal ones').
Here we have the corresponding abstract noun.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:128:6:1">1</span>. Víhâyas (comp. Bergaigne,
Religion Védique, III, 287) seems to be formed like vímahas, ví*k*etas,
vímanas. The meaning then will be 'of extended hâyas.' The substantive
hâyas, which is not found in the texts separately, may be derived from
*g*íhîte or from hinóti, and mean something like 'energy.' At all events
it seems impossible to connect this adjective víhâyas with the
substantive vihâyas, 'the aerial space,' belonging to the classical
language.

Note <span id="an_1:128:6:2">2</span>. Comp. the remark above, I, 58, 7,
note 2.

Note <span id="an_1:128:6:3">3</span>. I propose to read ví*s*vâ
ví-hâyâ*h* aratí*h* vásû dadhe háste dákshi*n*e. Comp. IX, 18, 4. â´
yá*h* ví*s*vâni vâ´ryâ vásûni hástayo*h* dadhé.

Note <span id="an_1:128:6:4">4</span>. Comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien,
I, 191.

Note <span id="an_1:128:6:5">5</span>. Comp. VIII, 19, 1. devatrâ´
havyám óhire.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:128:7:1">1</span>. I*l*â´ k*ri*tá seems to be
identical with íshk*ri*ta.

Note <span id="an_1:128:7:2">2</span>. Regarding the metre, comp.
Lanman, p. 383.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:128:8:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 58, 7, note 1.
