### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 9.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 9.

1\. Agni, have mercy! Thou art great, who hast come to this pious man to
sit down on the sacrificial grass.

2\. He who cannot be deceived, the zealous, the immortal has among men
become the messenger of all.

3\. He, the joy-giving Hot*ri*, is led around the sacred seat at the
heaven-aspiring sacrifices. And he sits down as the Pot*ri* also.

4\. Agni sits down also as (the sacrificer's)
wife [1](sbe46098.htm#an_4:9:4:1.md) at the sacrifice, and as the master of
the house in the house, and as the Brahman [2](sbe46098.htm#an_4:9:4:2.md).

5\. Thou zealously approachest as the
Upavakt*ri* [1](sbe46098.htm#an_4:9:5:1.md) of the people who perform the
sacrificial service, and (thou approachest) the offerings of men.

6\. And thou zealously performest the messenger-ship for the man in
whose sacrifice thou takest pleasure, in order to bear the mortal's
offering (to the gods).

7\. Find pleasure [1](sbe46098.htm#an_4:9:7:1.md) in our rites, in our
sacrifice, O Aṅgiras. Hear our call!

8\. May thy unerring chariot, by which thou protectest the worshippers,
encompass us from every side.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse I = SV. I, 23. Verse 8 = VS. III, 36;
MS. I, 5, 4. 5. 11.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_4:9:4:1">1</span>. 'Wir vermuten: utâgnâ agnir adhvare
… die correctur dürfte evident sein.' Ludwig. The same conjecture has
been proposed already in 1868 by Prof. Max Müller (Chips, 2nd ed., vol.
iii, p. 157). In my opinion the traditional text is correct.

Note <span id="an_4:9:4:2">2</span>. The Brahman very probably is not
the Brahman of the later ritual, but the Brâhma*n*â*kkh*a*m*sin. See
H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 396.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_4:9:5:1">1</span>. The Upavakt*ri* is identical with
the Pra*s*âst*ri* or Maitrâvaru*n*a of the later ritual. H. O., Religion
des Veda, p. 390.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_4:9:7:1">1</span>. On *g*oshi, cf. Bartholomae,
Studien zur Indog. Sprachgeschichte, I, 21.
