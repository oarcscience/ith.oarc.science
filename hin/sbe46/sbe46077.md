### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 17.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 17.

1\. He who is inflamed after the primitive ordinances, is anointed with
ointments [1](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:1:1), the giver of all treasures, he
whose hair is flame, whose stately robe is ghee, the purifier, skilled
in sacrifice, Agni—that he may sacrifice to the gods.

2\. As thou hast performed, O Agni, the Hot*ri*'s duty for the Earth, as
thou hast done it for Heaven, O *G*âtavedas, full of intelligence, in
the same way sacrifice with this offering to the gods. Prosper this
sacrifice to-day as thou hast done for Manus.

3\. Thou hast three lives, O *G*âtavedas, and three births from the
Dawn [1](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:3:1), O Agni! Being wise, sacrifice with
these to the favour of the gods, and bring luck and welfare to the
sacrificer.

4\. Praising Agni full of splendour, full of beauty, we adore thee, O
*G*âtavedas, deserving to be magnified. Thee the gods have made their
messenger, their steward [1](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:4:1), and carrier of
offerings, the navel of immortality.

5\. O Agni, the Hot*ri* who before thee was an excellent sacrificer, who
verily [1](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:5:1) sat down and brought luck by
himself [2](sbe46077.htm#an_3:17:5:2) sacrifice according to his rules,
O intelligent one, and set down our sacrifice at the feast of the gods.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Kata Vai*s*vâmitra, the metre Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 1 = TB.
I, 2, 1, 10. Verse 3 = TB. III, 2, 11, 2;

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> MS. IV, 11, 1; 12,
5. Verse 4 = TB. III, 6, 9, 1; MS. IV, 13, 5.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:17:1:1">1</span>. Possibly the poet intended to
allude also to the other meaning of aktúbhi*h*, which means both
'ointments' and 'nights.' The nights render Agni conspicuous and anoint
(a*ñg*) him as it were with beauty. I do not believe that the existence
of a Vedic word aktú, 'ointment,' should be denied; cf. Bechtel,
Nachrichten d. Göttinger Ges. d. Wiss. 1894, p. 398.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:17:3:1">1</span>. See Bergaigne, Religion Védique,
II, 14. Prof. Max Müller translates: Three lives are thine, the dawns
are thy three birthplaces, or three dawns are thy birthplaces.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:17:4:1">1</span>. See above, I, 58, 7, note 1.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:17:5:1">1</span>. Literally, 'doubly.' Grassmann is
right in observing that the Vedic poets show a certain predilection for
the word dvitâ´ when speaking of Agni's being established and doing his
work at the sacrifice. Prof. Max Muller thinks of Agni's two homes,
earth and heaven.

Note <span id="an_3:17:5:2">2</span>. On the Hot*ri* more ancient than
Agni, comp. Bergaigne, Religion Védique, I, 109. Probably this simply
refers to the Agni or the fire used at former sacrifices.
