### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 6.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 27.

1\. Accept, O Agni, this my piece of wood and this my sitting down
(reverentially) [1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:1:1), and hear these words of
mine.

2\. Let us worship thee, Agni, child of vigour, with this (piece of
wood?) [1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:2:1), O winner of
horses [2](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:2:2), with this well-spoken (hymn), O
well-born one.

3\. May we thus as thy devoted servants pay devotion by our words to
thee who acceptest words (of prayer), to thee who aspirest after wealth,
O giver of wealth.

4\. Thus be thou a liberal, bountiful lord, O lord of goods, O giver of
goods. Drive hatred away from us.

5\. Thus (give) us [1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:5:1) rain from the sky; thus
(give) us unattainable strength; thus (give) us thousandfold food.

6\. To him who magnifies thee, who desires thy help, O youngest
messenger, (invoked) by our word, best sacrificing Hot*ri*, come near.

7\. For thou, Agni, O sage, who knowest both races (of gods and of men),
passest (to and fro) between them, like a messenger belonging to thy own
people [1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:7:1), belonging to thy allies.

8\. Thus gladden (the gods) [1](sbe46056.htm#an_2:6:8:1) as the knowing
one; sacrifice, O intelligent one, in due order, and sit down on this
Barhis.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Gâyatrî.—Verse 4 = VS. XII, 43; TS. IV, 2, 3,
4; MS. II, 7, 10.—The hymn has been translated by M. M., Selected
Essays, II, p. 143.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:6:1:1">1</span>. It does not seem probable that
upasád is to be translated here according to its meaning in the later
ritual, as one of the preparatory ceremonies of the Soma sacrifice. See
Weber, Indische Studien, X, 363; Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, I,
300.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_2:6:2:1">1</span>. Ayâ´ may be used adverbially: comp.
III, 12, 2; VI, 17, 15; IX, 53, 2; 106, 14. But it is more probable that
samídhâ or girâ´ should be supplied from verse 1. Comp. II, 24, 1. ayâ´
vidhema girâ´; IV, 4, 15. ayâ´ samídhâ vidhema.

Note <span id="an_2:6:2:2">2</span>. Comp. VIII, 61, 7.
á*s*vam-ish*t*aye.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:6:5:1">1</span>. The conjecture sána*h*, proposed by
Böhtlingk-Roth and Grassmann, is not necessary. The verb is to be
supplied; comp. the passages collected by Pischel, Vedische Studien, I,
19.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_2:6:7:1">1</span>. *G*ányeva seems to be *g*ánya*h*
iva, comp. 11, 39, 1. dûtâ´-iva hávyâ *g*ányâ purutrâ´; IV, 55, 5. pâ´t
páti*h* *g*ányât á*m*hasa*h* na*h*.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_2:6:8:1">1</span>. Comp. VII, 17, 4. yákshat devâ´n
am*rí*tân pipráyat *k*a; VIII, 39, 9. yákshat *k*a pipráyat *k*a na*h*.
