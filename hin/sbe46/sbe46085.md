### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 25.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 25.

1\. Agni, thou art for ever the wise son of Heaven and of the Earth, the
all-wealthy one. In thy peculiar way [1](sbe46085.htm#an_3:25:1:1)
sacrifice here to the gods, O intelligent one!

2\. Agni, the knowing, obtains (for his worshipper) heroic powers; he
obtains (for him) strength, being busy for the sake of immortality.
Bring then the gods hither, O (Agni), rich in food.

3\. Agni, the wise, shines on Heaven and Earth, the two immortal
goddesses who encompass all people—he who rules through his strength,
and who is full of light through adoration.

4\. Agni and Indra, come hither to the sacrifice in the house of the
worshipper rich in pressed (Soma), never failing, ye two gods, at the
drink of Soma.

5\. Agni, thou art kindled in the house of the waters, (our) own (god),
O son of strength, *G*âtavedas, who exaltest the abodes (in which thou
dwellest) by thy blessing.
