### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 12.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 22–23.

1\. We choose Agni as our messenger, the all-possessor, as the Hot*ri*
of this sacrifice, the highly wise.

2\. Agni and Agni again they constantly invoked with their invocations,
the lord of the clans, the bearer of oblations, the beloved of many.

3\. Agni, when born, conduct the gods hither for him who has strewn the
Barhis (sacrificial grass) [1](sbe46004.htm#an_1:12:3:1.md); thou art our
Hot*ri*, worthy of being magnified [2](sbe46004.htm#an_1:12:3:2.md).

4\. Awaken them, the willing ones, when thou goest as messenger, O Agni.
Sit down with the gods on the Barhis.

5\. O thou to whom Gh*ri*ta oblations are poured out, resplendent (god),
burn against the mischievous, O Agni, against the sorcerers.

6\. By Agni Agni is kindled (or, by fire fire is kindled), the sage, the
master of the house, the young one, the bearer of oblations, whose mouth
is the sacrificial spoon.

7\. Praise Agni the sage, whose ordinances for the sacrifice are true,
the god who drives away sickness.

8\. Be the protector, O Agni, of a master of sacrificial food who
worships thee, O god, as his messenger.

9\. Be merciful, O purifier, unto the man who is rich in sacrificial
food, and who invites Agni to the feast of the gods.

10\. Thus, O Agni, resplendent purifier, conduct

the gods hither to us, to our sacrifice and to our food.

11\. Thus praised by us with our new Gâyatra hymn, bring us wealth of
valiant men and food.

12\. Agni with thy bright splendour be pleased, through all our
invocations of the gods, with this our praise.

#### NOTES.

This hymn is ascribed to Medhâtithi Kâ*n*va. It is the opening hymn of a
collection which extends from I, 12 to 23 (not, as Ludwig, III, 102,
believes, from I, 2 to 17; see my Prolegomena, p. 220). That the
authorship of this collection belongs indeed to the Ka*n*va family,
whose poetical compositions are found partly in the first and partly in
the eighth Ma*nd*ala, is shown by the text of 14, 2–5, and by other
evidence; see Zeitschr. der Deutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XXXVIII, 448.

The metre is Gâyatrî. It is possible, though I do not think it probable,
that the hymn should be considered as consisting of T*rik*as. Verse 1 =
SV. I, 3; TS. II, 5, 8, 5; V, 5, 6, 1; TB. III, 5, 2, 3; MS. IV, 10, 2.
Verses 1–3= SV. II, 140–142; AV. XX, 101, 1–3. Verse 2 = TS. IV, 3, 13,
8; MS. IV, 10, 1. Verse 3 = TB. III, II, 6, 2. Verses 6, 8, 9 = SV. II,
194–196. Verse 6 = TS. I, 4, 46, 3; III, 5, 11, 5; V, 5, 6, 1; TB. II,
7, 12, 3; MS. IV, 10, 2 (3). Verse 7 = SV. I, 32. Verse 10 = VS. XVII,
9; TS. I, 3, 14, 8; 5, 5, 3; IV, 6, 1, 3; MS. I, 5, 1.
