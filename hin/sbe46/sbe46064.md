### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 4.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 22–23.

#### ÂPRÎ HYMN.

1\. Log by log [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:1:1) be kind towards us. Flash by
flash grant us thy, the Vasu's, favour [2](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:1:2).
Bring hither, O god, the gods that we may sacrifice. Sacrifice, O Agni,
as a kind friend to thy friends.

2\. Thou whom the gods, Varu*n*a, Mitra, Agni, thrice every day bring
hither by sacrifice day by day, Tanûnapât, make this our sacrifice
honey-sweet, having its abode in ghee [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:2:1),
(this sacrifice) which worships (the gods).

3\. (Our adoring) thought rich in all boons goes forward for worshipping
as the first the Hot*ri* of the sacred food (i*l*), for saluting the
strong bull with adoration and homage. May he, the best sacrificer,
incited (by our prayers) sacrifice to the
gods [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:3:1).

4\. Upwards your [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:4:1) course has been directed
at the worship; upwards (your) flames [2](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:4:2) are
gone; ready (for receiving you) is the air [3](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:4:3).
Or the Hot*ri* has sat down at heaven's navel. We spread out the
sacrificial grass which receives the gods.

5 [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:1). Choosing in their mind the sevenfold
work of the Hot*ri*s [2](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:2), enlivening everything
(the gods) came hither in the right way. (The divine
doors [3](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:3)) with men as their
ornaments [4](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:4), born at the
sacrifices [5](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:5), have come hither and thither to
this sacrifice, many of them.

6\. Hither (shall come) the two Dawns [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:6:1), the
neighbourly (goddesses) of glorious
appearance [2](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:6:2).

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Of different
forms, they both smile. (They shall come) that Mitra and Varu*n*a may be
satisfied with us, and Indra accompanied by the Maruts with their
powers [3](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:6:3).

7\. I catch hold of the two divine Hot*ri*s first. The seven strong
ones [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:7:1) rejoice according to their wont.
Teaching the right, they proclaim the right, the guardians of law,
contemplating the law.

8 [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:8:1). May Bhâratî, in concord with the
Bhâratîs, I*l*â with the gods, Agni with men, Sarasvatî with all
(beings) belonging to Sarasvatî (come) hither; may the three goddesses
sit down on this sacrificial grass.

9\. O divine Tvash*tri*, grant us and send forth this our seed which is
to thrive: (the seed) from which a manly son is born able and skilful,
who sets to work the press-stones, loving the gods.

10\. O tree [1](sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:10:1), send (the offering) forth to
the gods. May Agni the slaughterer make the offering ready. May the
same, the very true Hot*ri*, sacrifice according as he knows the
generations of the gods.

11\. Agni, being kindled, come hither, on one chariot with Indra, with
the quick gods. May Aditi, the mother of noble sons, sit down on our
sacrificial grass. With Svâhâ may the immortal gods rejoice.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 9 = TS. III, 1, 11, 1; MS.
IV, 13, 10. Verse 10 = VS. XXVII, 21; TS. IV, 1, 8, 3; MS. II, 12, 6.

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:4:1:1">1</span>. Agni is invoked as personified in
each log of fuel which is put on the sacrificial fire.

Note <span id="an_3:4:1:2">2</span>. Comp. VII, 39, 1. sumatím vásva*h*.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:4:2:1">1</span>. Comp. II, 3, 11. gh*ri*tám asya
yóni*h*.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:4:3:1">1</span>. Comp. X, 110, 3. sá*h* enân yakshi
ishitá*h* yá*g*îyân (cf. also X, 110, 9).

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:4:4:1">1</span>. The text has the dual vâm. But who
are the two beings addressed? According to Sâya*n*a, Agni and the
Barhis, which does not seem very probable. The structure of the phrase
gives the impression—though this impression is by no means certain—that
vâm, which belongs to gâtu, is to be supplied to so*k*î´*m*shi also. If
we are right in this supposition, are not the two beings in question the
two first of the three sacred fires, the Âhavanîya and Gârhapatya? These
two fires are frequently spoken of in the ritual texts as of a dyad,
with the omission of the third fire.—Prof. Max Müller proposes to change
vâm into vâ. According to him the meaning may be: Either the road has
been made upward, i. e. the flames have gone upward to the sky, or Agni
has sat down at heaven's navel.

Note <span id="an_3:4:4:2">2</span>. Comp. VII, 43, 2. ûrdhvâ´
*s*o*k*î´*m*shi devayû´ni asthu*h*.

Note <span id="an_3:4:4:3">3</span>. Possibly the words ûrdhvâ´
*s*o*k*î´*m*shi prásthitâ rá*g*â*m*si may form one clause, 'upwards
(your) flames are gone towards the sky.' M. M.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:4:5:1">1</span>. On this verse, comp. Pischel,
Vedische Studien, II, 115 seq.

Note <span id="an_3:4:5:2">2</span>. On the seven priests of the ancient
Soma sacrifice, comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 383 seq.

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

Note <span id="an_3:4:5:3">3</span>. That this subject is to be
supplied, is shown by the regular composition of the Âprî hymns. It is
confirmed by the word pûrvî´*h*, which is evidently an epithet of the
divine doors; comp. I, 188, 5; VII, 2, 5.

Note <span id="an_3:4:5:4">4</span>. 'In human form.' M. M.

Note <span id="an_3:4:5:5">5</span>. The text has vidátheshu.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:4:6:1">1</span>. I. e. Night and Dawn.

Note <span id="an_3:4:6:2">2</span>. Comp. above, I, 142, 7.

Note <span id="an_3:4:6:3">3</span>. Comp. M. M., vol. xxxii, p. 196
seq.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:4:7:1">1</span>. Comp. above, I, 127, 5, note 1.
Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 96) may be right in taking the seven
p*ri*kshâ´sa*h* as the Aṅgiras, the saptá víprâ*h*.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_3:4:8:1">1</span>. The verses 8–11 are repeated in
VII, 2, 8–11.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_3:4:10:1">1</span>. The tree is the sacrificial post
(yûpa).
