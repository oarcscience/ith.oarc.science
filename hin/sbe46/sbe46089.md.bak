### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 29.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 32–34.

1 [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:1:1.md). This is the support on which the
rubbing (for producing the fire) is
performed [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:1:2.md); the creative
organ [3](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:1:3.md) has been prepared. Bring hither the
house-wife [4](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:1:4.md); let us produce Agni by rubbing
in the old way.

2\. In the two fire-sticks dwells *G*âtavedas, as the germ (lies) safe
in pregnant women—Agni who should be
magnified [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:2:1.md) day by day by wakeful men who
bring offerings.

3\. Place it [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:3:1.md) skilfully into her who lies
extended [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:3:2.md). Having conceived she has quickly
given birth to the manly one. He whose summit is red—bright is his
splendour—the son of I*l*â has been born in the (due)
way [3](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:3:3.md).

4\. In the place of I*l*â, on the navel of the earth we will lay thee
down, *G*âtavedas, that thou, O Agni, mayst carry the offerings (to the
gods).

5\. Rub, ye men, the truthful sage, the wise, the immortal, the
fair-faced. Bring forth, ye men, Agni, the banner of sacrifice, the
first in the front, the gracious one.

6\. When they produce him by rubbing with their arms, he shines forth
*l*aming in the wood like a red race-horse. Like the bright one on the
path of the A*s*vins [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:6:1.md) the unrestrained
(Agni) spares the stones, burning the
grass [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:6:2.md).

7\. Agni, when born, shines forth resplendent, the racer, the priest,
praised by the sages, the giver of rain, whom the gods placed in the
sacrifices, to be

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

magnified, as the omniscient carrier of the sacrificial offerings.

8\. Sit down, O Hot*ri*, in the space which is thine, as the knowing
one. Place the sacrifice in the abode of good works (i. e. on the
altar). Eagerly longing for the gods thou shalt worship the gods by
offerings. Agni, bestow mighty vigour on the sacrificer.

9\. Produce a mighty [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:9:1.md) smoke, ye friends.
Without fail go forward towards strength. This Agni is the conqueror in
battles, rich in valiant men, he by whom the gods have overpowered the
Dasyus.

10\. This is thy birth-place in due time whence born thou shonest forth;
knowing it, O Agni, sit down on it, and make our prayers prosper.

11\. He is called Tanûnapât as the Asura's germ. Narâ*s*a*m*sa he
becomes when he is born, Mâtari*s*van when he has been shaped in the
mother [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:11:1.md). And he has become the rush of the
wind in his swift course [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:11:2.md),

12\. Rubbed forth by skilful rubbing, established by skilful
establishing, as a sage, O Agni, perform excellent sacrifices. Sacrifice
to the gods for him who is devoted to the
gods [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:12:1.md).

13\. The mortals have generated the immortal one, the
… [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:13:1.md), advancing one with strong jaws. The
ten unwedded sisters [2](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:13:2.md) united take care of
the man (Agni) when he has been born.

14\. He the god of the seven Hot*ri*s shone forth from of old, when he
flamed up in his mother's lap, at her udder. Day by day the joyous one
never closes his eyes, when he has been born from the Asura's (i. e. of
the Heaven's?) belly [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:14:1.md).

15\. The onsets of (Agni) when he attacks his enemies, are like those of
the Maruts. (He is) the

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

first-born (son) of the sacred spell. They know every
(fire) [1](sbe46089.htm#an_3:29:15:1.md). The Ku*s*ikas have raised their
brilliant spell; they have kindled Agni, every one in his house.

16\. After we had chosen thee here to-day, O wise Hot*ri*, while this
sacrifice was going on, thou hast firmly sacrificed and firmly laboured.
Come to this Soma, expert and knowing!

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The prevalent metre is Trish*t*ubh.—Verses 1, 4, 10,
12 are Anush*t*ubh; verses 6, 11, 14, 15, *G*agatî.

The Sûkta, which belongs to the later additions (see the note on hymn
28), consists of a number of verses and small groups of verses referring
to the production of fire by the attrition of the two fire-sticks. The
order in which the verses stand does not always agree with the natural
order of the ritual acts.—Verse 2 = SV. I, 79. Verse 3 = VS. XXXIV, 14.
Verse 4 = VS. XXXIV, 15; TS. III, 5, 11, 1; MS. I, 6, 2. 7; IV, 10, 4;
11, 1. Verse 8 = VS. XI, 35; TS. III, 5, 11, 2; IV, 1, 3, 3; MS. II, 7,
3; IV, 10, 4. Verse 10 = VS. III, 14; XII, 52; XV, 56; TS. I, 5, 5, 2;
IV, 2, 4, 3; 7, 13, 5; TB. I, 2, 1, 16; II, 5, 8, 8; MS. I, 5, 1; 6, 1;
AV. III, 20, 1. Verse 13 = TB. I, 2, 1, 19. Verse 16 = VS. VIII, 20; TS.
I, 4, 44, 2; MS. I, 3, 38; AV. VII, 97, 1.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:29:1:1">1</span>. The verses 1–3 a, b have been
translated by Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, V, p. 209.

Note <span id="an_3:29:1:2">2</span>. On the adhimanthana*s*akala, the
piece of wood on which the lower fire-stick is laid, see *S*atapatha
Brâhma*n*a

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> III, 4, 1, 20.
so<sup><span class="small">ऽ</span></sup>dhimanthana*m* *s*akalam âdatte
agner *g*anitram asîty atra hy agnir *g*âyate. Schwab, Das Altindische
Thieropfer, p. 78 seq.

Note <span id="an_3:29:1:3">3</span>. Pra*g*ánana seems to be used in
the concrete sense as the male organ. As such, the poet may have
considered the so-called pramantha in the generation of Agni, which is
described as having the shape of the male organ (Schwab, loc. cit., 78;
see also Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLIII,
591). It does not seem very probable that the darbhapi*ñg*ûla of which
Sâya*n*a thinks should be meant.

Note <span id="an_3:29:1:4">4</span>. Sâya*n*a explains this as meaning
the Ara*n*i (fire-stick), i. e. the lower Ara*n*i, the receptacle of the
upper fire-stick. In the Taittirîya Brâhma*n*a I, 2, 1, 13 the two
Ara*n*is are addressed as mahî vi*s*patnî.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:29:2:1">1</span>. The text has î´*d*ya*h*.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:29:3:1">1</span>. The upper fire-stick or, more
accurately, the pramantha.

Note <span id="an_3:29:3:2">2</span>. Comp. above, II, 10, 3. The lower
Ara*n*i is alluded to, which is considered as a wife and more
particularly as the nymph Urva*s*î (Kâtyâyana V, 1, 30, &c.).

Note <span id="an_3:29:3:3">3</span>. Prof. Pischel (Vedische Studien,
I, 301) takes the genitive í*l*âyâ*h* as dependent on vayúne: 'wurde der
Sohn geboren am Orte (Wege) der Opferspende.' To me it seems unnatural
not to connect í*l*âyâ*h* with putrá*h*, which words are connected also
by the Sandhi (the Sa*m*hitâ text has í*l*âyâs putró, not í*l*âyâ*h*
putró).

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:29:6:1">1</span>. For yâ´man, cf. I, 37, 3; III, 2,
14 VI, 15, 5. Should not the bright one on the path of the A*s*vins be
the sun? Sâya*n*a thinks of the chariot of the A*s*vins, which also may
be right.

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

Note <span id="an_3:29:6:2">2</span>. Are the stones and the grass
identical with the stones and grass-blades occurring in the later ritual
of the agnyâdheya and agnimanthana (*S*atapatha Br. II, 1, 1, 8; III, 4,
1, 21; Kâtyâyana IV, 8, 16, &c.)?

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_3:29:9:1">1</span>. Literally, a manly, strong, or
bull-like smoke.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_3:29:11:1">1</span>. This is a play upon words
(Mâtarí*s*vâ and ámimîta mâtári, 'he has been shaped in the mother').

Note <span id="an_3:29:11:2">2</span>. Von Bradke (Dyâus Asura, p. 51):
des Windes Heerde (?) wird er, wenn er dahingleitet.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_3:29:12:1">1</span>. This Pâda is identical with I,
15, 12. It is a galita.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_3:29:13:1">1</span>. The meaning of asremán (comp. X,
8, 2. asremâ´ vatsá*h* \[i. e. Agni\] *s*ímîvân arâvît) is unknown.

Note <span id="an_3:29:13:2">2</span>. The ten fingers.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_3:29:14:1">1</span>. Comp. von Bradke, loc. cit., 50.

##### Verse 15.

Note <span id="an_3:29:15:1">1</span>. Or prathama*g*â´m bráhmana*h*
ví*s*ve ít vidu*h*: 'all (people) know him the first-born (son) of the
sacred spell'? Comp. I, 34, 2. sómasya venâ´m ánu ví*s*ve ít
vidu*h*.—Prof. Max Müller writes: 'Prathama*g*â*h* is the wind, X, 168,
3. It might here refer to the Maruts, who are often said to sing
prayers; they know all about Brahman (prayer).'
