### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 8.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 26.

1\. Thee, O Agni, the men who love *Ri*ta have kindled, the ancient ones
thee the ancient, for the sake of bliss, O (god) who art produced by
strength; the highly-brilliant, worshipful, in whom all refreshment
dwells, the household god, the lord of the house, the chosen.

2\. Thee, O Agni, the clans have set down, the ancient guest, the
flame-haired lord of the house, with mighty light, with many shapes, the
winner of prizes, giving good shelter and good help, who is busy among
the decayed (wood) [1](sbe46112.htm#an_5:8:2:1).

3\. Thee, O Agni, the human clans magnify, who knowest (the art of
sacrificial) libations, who separatest (what was
mixed) [1](sbe46112.htm#an_5:8:3:1), the highest bestower of treasures,
who, (though) dwelling in secret, O blessed one, (yet) art visible to
all, mightily roaring, an excellent sacrificer, shining with ghee.

4\. Thee, O Agni, the supporter, we always have praised with our songs
and have sat down near thee with adoration. Thus being kindled, O
Aṅgiras, be pleased with us, as a god through the mortal's brilliant
(offering) [1](sbe46112.htm#an_5:8:4:1), with thy glorious splendours.

5\. Thou, O Agni, manifold-shaped, bestowest vigour on every house in
thy ancient way, O much-praised one.! Thou rulest with might over much
food. This impetuousness of thine, when thou rushest forward
impetuously, is not to be defied.

6\. Thee, O Agni, when kindled, O youngest one, the gods have made their
messenger and bearer of

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

oblations. Thee who extendest over wide spaces, who dwellest in ghee,
into whom offerings are poured, they have made their eye, impetuous,
stirring thoughts.

7\. Thee, O Agni, on whom offerings of ghee are poured, (men) desirous
of thy favour have kindled from of old with good fuel. Thus, grown
strong, increased by the plants, thou spreadest thyself over the
terrestrial spaces.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, *G*agatî.—Verse 3 = TS. III, 3, 11, 2. Verses
6, 7 = TB. I, 2, 1, 12.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:8:2:1">1</span>. The Padapâ*th*a gives
*g*arat-vísham. I prefer this explanation to *g*ara-dvísham ('who hates
decay').

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:8:3:1">1</span>. Agni is, in the later ritual,
worshipped as 'separator' (vívi*k*i), if the sacrificer's fires have
become mixed with other fires. See Taittirîya Brâhma*n*a III, 7, 3, 5;
*S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a XII, 4, 4, 2 (where this very verse is quoted),
&c.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:8:4:1">1</span>. For ya*s*ásâ, Böhtlingk-Roth
conjecture yá*s*asâ, which seems to me a conjectura nimis facilis. I
think that the adjective ya*s*ásâ is right, and that a noun, meaning
'offering' or the like, should be supplied. Cf. above, IV, 1, 16, note
4.
