### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 14.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 14.

1\. Agni *G*âtavedas, the god, has looked on the dawns that shine with
all their might [1](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:1:1.md). Come hither, O
Nâsatyas [2](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:1:2), wide-ruling (gods.md), on your
chariot to this our sacrifice.

2\. The god Savit*ri* has sent his shine upward, producing light for the
whole world. The Sun, shining with his rays, has filled Heaven and Earth
and the air.

3\. The red one [1](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:3:1.md), carrying hither
(bliss) [2](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:3:2.md), has come with her light, the
great, brilliant one, shining with her rays. Ushas, the goddess,
awakening (all beings) to welfare, goes along on her well-yoked chariot.

4\. May those chariots and horses, most ready to drive, drive
you [1](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:4:1.md) hither at the break of dawn. For these
Somas are for you that you may drink the
honey-drink [2](sbe46103.htm#an_4:14:4:2.md). Rejoice, O manly ones, at
this sacrifice.

5̅ IV, 13, 5.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—No verse of this hymn occurs in the other
Sa*m*hitâs. On the parallelism in which IV, 14 stands to IV, 13, see the
introductory note on IV, 13.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_4:14:1:1">1</span>. On máhobhi*h*, see vol. xxxii, p.
196 seq. (I, 165, 5, note 3). Here the word refers to the powerful light
of

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

the dawn, not of Agni, cf. VI, 64, 2. úsha*h* devi ró*k*amânâ
máhobhi*h*.

Note <span id="an_4:14:1:2">2</span>. On the mention of the Nâsatyas
(A*s*vins) in this connection, compare the introductory note on IV, 13.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_4:14:3:1">1</span>. The Dawn as before.

Note <span id="an_4:14:3:2">2</span>. That an object like 'bliss' is to
be supplied, is shown by such passages as I, 48, 9. úsha*h* … âváhantî
bhû´ri asmábhyam saúbhagam; I, 92, 3. (the Dawns) ísham váhantî*h*
suk*rí*te sudâ´nave; I, 113, 15. (the Dawn) âváhantî póshyâ vâ´ryâ*n*i.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_4:14:4:1">1</span>. The text has the dual of the
pronoun. The A*s*vins are addressed.

Note <span id="an_4:14:4:2">2</span>. It is the peculiar character of
the A*s*vins that they drink mádhu; see Hillebrandt, Vedische
Mythologie, vol. i, p. 239 seq. H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 208, note
4; p. 367, note 2.
