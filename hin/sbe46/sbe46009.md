### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 36.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 8–11.

1\. We implore [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:1) with well-spoken words the
vigorous [2](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:2) Agni who belongs to many
people [3](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:3), to the clans that worship the
gods [4](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:1:4), whom other people (also) magnify.

2\. Men have placed Agni (on the altar) as the augmenter of strength.
May we worship thee, rich in sacrificial food. Thus be thou here to-day
gracious to us, a helper in our striving for gain, O good one!

 

3\. We choose thee, the all-possessor, as our messenger and as our
Hot*ri*. The flames of thee, who art great, spread around; thy rays
touch the heaven.

4\. The gods, Varu*n*a, Mitra, Aryaman, kindle thee, the ancient
messenger. The mortal, O Agni, who worships thee, gains through thee
every prize.

 

5\. Thou art the cheerful Hot*ri* and householder, O Agni, the messenger
of the clans. In thee all the firm laws are comprised which the gods
have made [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:5:1).

6\. In thee, the blessed one, O Agni, youngest god, all sacrificial food
is offered. Sacrifice then thou who art gracious to us to-day and
afterwards [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:6:1), to the gods that we may be
rich in valiant men.

 

7\. Him, the king, verily the adorers approach reverentially. With
oblations men kindle Agni, having overcome all failures.

8\. Destroying the foe [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:8:1), they
(victoriously) got through Heaven and Earth and the waters; they

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

have made wide room for their dwelling. May the manly
(Agni) [2](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:8:2), after he has received the
oblations, become brilliant at the side of Ka*n*va; may he neigh as a
horse in battles.

 

9\. Take thy seat; thou art great. Shine forth, thou who most
excellently repairest to the gods. O Agni, holy god, emit thy red,
beautiful smoke, O glorious one!

10\. Thou whom the gods have placed here for Manu as the best performer
of the sacrifice, O carrier of oblations, whom Ka*n*va and Medhyâtithi,
whom V*ri*shan and Upastuta [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:10:1) (have
worshipped,) the winner of prizes.

 

11\. That Agni's nourishment has shone brightly whom Medhyâtithi and
Ka*n*va have kindled on behalf of *Ri*ta [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:11:1).
Him do these hymns, him do we extol.

12\. Fill (us with) wealth, thou self-dependent one, for thou, O Agni,
hast companionship with the gods. Thou art lord over glorious booty.
Have mercy upon us; thou art great.

 

13\. Stand up straight for blessing us, like the god Savit*ri*, straight
a winner of booty, when we with our worshippers and with
ointments [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:13:1) call
thee [2](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:13:2) in emulation (with other people).

14\. Standing straight, protect us by thy splendour from evil; burn down
every ghoul [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:14:1). Let us stand straight that
we may walk and live. Find out our
worship [2](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:14:2) among the gods.

 

15\. Save us, O Agni, from the sorcerer, save us from mischief, from the
niggard. Save us from him

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

who does us harm or tries to kill us, O youngest god with bright
splendour!

16\. As with a club [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:16:1) smite the niggards in
all directions, and him who deceives us, O god with fiery jaws. The
mortal who makes (his weapons) very sharp by night, may that impostor
not rule over us.

 

17\. Agni has won abundance in heroes, Agni prosperity (for Ka*n*va).
Agni and the two Mitras (i. e. Mitra and Varu*n*a) have blessed
Medhyâtithi, Agni (has blessed) Upastuta in the acquirement (of
wealth) [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:17:1).

18\. Through Agni we call hither from afar Turva*s*a, Yadu, and
Ugradeva. May Agni, our strength against the Dasyu, conduct Navavâstva,
B*ri*hadratha, and Turvîti [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:18:1).

 

19\. Manu has established thee, O Agni, as a light for all people. Thou
hast shone forth with Ka*n*va, born from *Ri*ta, grown strong, thou whom
the human races worship.

20\. Agni's flames are impetuous and violent; they are terrible and not
to be withstood. Always burn down the sorcerers, and the allies of the
Yâtus, every ghoul [1](sbe46009.htm#an_1:36:20:1).

#### NOTES.

The authorship of this hymn, and of the whole collection to which it
belongs (I, 36–43), is ascribed to Ka*n*va Ghaura. Numerous passages
show indeed that it was the family of the Ka*n*vas, or rather, to speak
more accurately, a branch of that family, among which this group of
hymns has been composed. But it is as great a mistake in this as in

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

a number of similar cases to accept the founder of one of the great
Brâhmanical families as an author of Vedic poems. Comp. Zeitschrift der
Deutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, XLII, 215 seq.

The metre is alternately B*ri*hatî and Satob*ri*hatî, so that the hymn
consists of strophes (Pragâtha) of two verses. Verse 1 = SV. I, 59.
Verse 9 = VS. XI, 37; TS. IV, 1, 3, 3 (V, 1, 4, 5); TÂr. IV, 5, 2 (V, 4,
6); MS. II, 7, 3; IV, 9, 3. Verse 13 = SV. I, 57; VS. XI, 42; TS. IV, 1,
4, 2 (V, 1, 5, 3); MS. II, 7, 4. Verses 13, 14 = TB. III, 6, 1, 2; TÂr.
IV, 20, 1; MS. IV, 13, 1. Verse 19 = SV. I, 54.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:36:1:1">1</span>. Literally, we entreat for you.
Comp. on this use of the pronoun va*h*, Delbrück, Altindische Syntax,
206. See also Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XX, 64.

Note <span id="an_1:36:1:2">2</span>. The meaning of yahvá cannot be
determined with full certainty.

Note <span id="an_1:36:1:3">3</span>. There is no sufficient reason to
change with Ludwig (IV, 254) purû*n*â´m to Pûrû*n*â´m, and thus to
convert the metrically correct Pâda into an irregular one.—Comp.
Bollensen, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XXII, 593.

Note <span id="an_1:36:1:4">4</span>. On devayatî´nâm, comp. Lanman, p.
399.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:36:5:1">1</span>. 'On thee all the eternal works are
united, i. e. depend, which the gods have wrought; such as sun, stars,
lightning.' M. M.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:36:6:1">1</span>. With the third Pâda compare the
third Pâda of verse 2. It is a galita.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:36:8:1">1</span>. The word 'the foe' (v*ri*tra)
alludes to the name of the demon conquered by Indra; see H. O., Religion
des Veda, 135, note 2.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

Note <span id="an_1:36:8:2">2</span>. The metre would become more
correct by reading v*ri*shabhá*h* instead of v*rí*shâ. Or V*rí*sha*n*i,
'with V*ri*shan'? Comp. verse 10.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:36:10:1">1</span>. Medhyâtithi or Medhâtithi is very
frequently mentioned in connection with Ka*n*va.

V*ri*shan is taken as a proper name by Boehtlingk-Roth and by Grassmann
(not by Ludwig) in VI, 16, 15. Possibly they are right, but in no case
can V*ri*shan of the sixth book, named by the side of Dadhya*ñk* and
Atharvan, be identified with any probability with the V*ri*shan
mentioned in our passage, who evidently belongs to the ancestors of the
Ka*n*vas.

Upastuta is mentioned again together with Ka*n*va and Medhyâtithi in
verse 17 of our hymn, together with Ka*n*va in VIII, 5, 25. Comp. I,
112, 15; VIII, 103, 8; X, 115, 8. 9; Bergaigne, Rel. Véd., II, 448.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_1:36:11:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 139, 2. yát ha tyát
mitrâvaru*n*âv *ri*tâ´t ádhi âdadâ´the án*ri*tam svéna manyúnâ; X, 73,
5. mándamâna*h* *ri*tâ´t ádhi.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_1:36:13:1">1</span>. A*ñg*íbhi*h* can possibly mean
'who have salved themselves.' There is no reason to think of the
anointing of the yûpa (sacrificial post), to which Sâya*n*a refers the
word.

Note <span id="an_1:36:13:2">2</span>. On vi-hvâ, comp. Pischel-Geldner,
I, 144. There must be a technical reason, unknown to me, for the
connection in which this verb repeatedly occurs, as is the case in our
passage, with the noun vâghat: comp. III, 8, 10 (see below); VIII, 5,
16. purutrâ´ *k*it hí vâm narâ vihváyante manîshí*n*a*h* vâghádbhi*h*
a*s*vinâ â´ gatam.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_1:36:14:1">1</span>. The exact meaning of atrín is
unknown.

Note <span id="an_1:36:14:2">2</span>. Geldner's conjectures on duvas
seem rather bold

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

to me (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 233). Comp. vol. xxxii, pp. 203–206
(I, 165, 14).

##### Verse 16.

Note <span id="an_1:36:16:1">1</span>. On ghanéva, see Lanman,
Noun-Inflection, 334.

##### Verse 17.

Note <span id="an_1:36:17:1">1</span>. On Medhyâtithi and Upastuta, see
the note on verse 10. Aufrecht (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, 612) believes
that in mitrótá an abbreviation of the name Mitrâtithi (X, 33, 7) is
contained; he translates: 'Agni has promoted Mitrâtithi, Medhyâtithi,
and Upastuta in the acquirement of wealth.' This is very ingenious, but
I do not think that the reason which Aufrecht gives is sufficient: it
cannot be understood, he says, why Mitra (or Mitra and Varu*n*a) should
be mentioned in a hymn exclusively addressed to Agni. But similar cases
are quite frequent.—Prof. Max Müller writes: 'Could mitrâ stand for
mitrâ*n*i? Agni has protected his friends and also Medhyâtithi.' Comp.
also Lanman, p. 342.

##### Verse 18.

Note <span id="an_1:36:18:1">1</span>. On Turva*s*a and Yadu, comp.
Muir, V, 286; Bergaigne, II, 354 seq.; Zeitschr. der D. Morg. Ges. XLII,
220. There is not the slightest reason for Ludwig's statement (IV, 254)
that this hymn is a 'gebet um sig für den auf einem kriegszuge
befindlichen Turvaçakönig.'

Ugradeva is not mentioned again. On Navavâstva and B*ri*hadratha, comp.
X, 49, 6; VI, 20, 11; on Turvîti, the materials collected by Bergaigne,
Rel. Véd., II, 358 seq.

##### Verse 20.

Note <span id="an_1:36:20:1">1</span>. See verse 14, note 1.
