### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 4.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 24–25.

1\. I call for you Agni, shining with beautiful shine, praised with
beautiful praise [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:1:1.md), the guest of the clans,
the receiver of fine offerings, who is desirable like Mitra (or, like an
ally), *G*âtavedas the god, among godly people.

2\. The Bh*ri*gus worshipping him in the abode of the
waters [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:2:1.md) have
verily [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:2:2.md) established him among the clans of
Âyu. Let him surpass all worlds, Agni, the steward of the
gods [3](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:2:3.md), the possessor of quick horses.

3\. The gods have established beloved Agni among the human clans as
(people) going to settle (establish) Mitra [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:3:1.md).
May he illuminate the nights that are longing (for him), he who should
be treated kindly by the liberal (worshipper) in his house.

4\. His prosperity is delightful as good pasture
(?) [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:4:1.md); delightful is his appearance when the
burning one is driven forward, he who quickly shaking his tongue among
the plants waves [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:4:2.md) his tail mightily like a
chariot-horse.

5\. When they praised [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:5:1.md) to me the monstrous
might of the eater of the forests [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:5:2.md), he
produced his (shining) colour as (he has done) for the
U*s*i*g*s [3](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:5:3.md). With shining splendour he has
shone joyously, he who having grown old has suddenly become young
(again).

6\. He who shines on the forests [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:6:1.md) as if he
were thirsty, who resounded like water on its path, like (the rattle of
the wheels) of a chariot [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:6:2.md)—he whose

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

path is black, the hot, the joyous one has shone,
laughing [3](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:6:3.md) like the sky with its clouds.

7\. He who has spread himself burning over the wide (earth), moves about
like an animal, free, without a keeper. The naming Agni, burning down
the brushwood, with a black trail [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:7:1.md), has, as
it were, tasted the earth.

8\. Now in the remembrance of thy former blessings this prayer has been
recited to thee at the third sacrifice [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:8:1.md).
Give to us, Agni, mighty strength with a succession of valiant men, with
plenty of food; (give us) wealth with good
progeny [2](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:8:2.md).

9\. Give, O Agni, such vigour to thy praiser together with his liberal
(lords), that the G*ri*tsamadas, rich in valiant men, victorious over
hostile plots, attaining (their aim) in secret, may overcome through
thee (their rivals) who get behind [1](sbe46054.htm#an_2:4:9:1.md).

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Somâhuti Bhârgava, the metre Trish*t*ubh.—No verse occurs
in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:4:1:1">1</span>. To me there seems to be no doubt
that the meaning of suv*ri*ktí is something like 'beautiful prayer,'
beautiful song,' and then 'a god who is invoked with beautiful songs.'
Thus suvriktáya*h* or other cases of the same word stand by the side of
stómâ*h* … gíra*h*, VIII, 8, 22; of gíra*h*, I, 64, 1; VIII, 96, 10,
comp. X, 64, 4; of bráhma, VII, 31, 11; 97, 9; of stómai*h*, VII, 96, 1;
of dhîtíbhi*h*, VI, 61, 2; of á*kkh*oktibhi*h* matînâ´m, I, 61, 3, and
so on. Comp. also VII, 83, 9. hávâ´mahe vâm v*ri*sha*n*â
suv*ri*ktíbhi*h*; X, 41, 1. rátham … suv*ri*ktíbhi*h* vayám vỹush*t*â
ushása*h* havâmahe; X, 80, 7. avo*k*âma suv*ri*ktím.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

This being the meaning of the word, I cannot think it probable—and
herein I differ from the opinion pronounced by Prof. Max Müller, vol.
xxxii, p. 109—that it stands in connection with the verb v*rig* in its
well-known use referring to the Barhis. In my opinion (comp. also
Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 151) suv*ri*ktí may be connected with
another use of v*rig*, with the meaning of this verb 'to draw a god
towards himself, averting him from other sacrificers' (materials
regarding this use of v*rig* have been collected by Geldner, loc. cit.,
144). Or possibly the word may be derived, as Prof. von Roth believes,
from *rik* (comp. suvita derived from i). It is true that the
substantive *ri*kti does not occur by itself: but, as Prof. Max Müller
remarks (loc. cit.), this would not be fatal to Prof. von Roth's
etymology, because many other words in the Veda occur as uttarapadas
only. If we accept this theory, we should of course have to separate
suv*ri*ktí from námov*ri*kti and sváv*ri*kti.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_2:4:2:1">1</span>. Comp. X, 46, 2. imám vidhánta*h*
apâ´m sadhásthe.

Note <span id="an_2:4:2:2">2</span>. Literally, 'doubly.' 'In two
places, in the abode of the waters and among the clans of man.' M. M.
Compare, however, X, 46, 2 (see last note).

Note <span id="an_2:4:2:3">3</span>. Devâ´nâm aratí*h*; comp. I, 58, 7,
note 1.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_2:4:3:1">1</span>. The meaning seems to be that people
going to settle anywhere, secure safety by ceremonies addressed to
Mitra, i. e. possibly by concluding alliances which stand under the
special protection of Mitra. Comp. IV, 33, 10; H. O., Religion des Veda,
186, note 1.—Mitra is kshetrasâ´dhas, VIII, 31, 14.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_2:4:4:1">1</span>. Svásya-iva seems to be corrupt.
Possibly we might read sûyávasâ-iva push*t*í*h*. In X, 11, 5 we read,
sádâ asi ra*n*vá*h*, yávasâ-iva púshyate. IV, 16, 15. óka*h* ná ra*n*vâ´
sud*rís*î-iva push*t*í*h*.—The translation of the traditional

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

reading would be, 'His prosperity is delightful, like that of a person
belonging to us.'

Note <span id="an_2:4:4:2">2</span>. Bháribhrat seems to be a
participle: but then dodhavîti must be accented (dódhavîti).

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:4:5:1">1</span>. On the verb pan, comp. Pischel,
Vedische Studien, I, 199 seq.

Note <span id="an_2:4:5:2">2</span>. Vanád seems to be, as Grassmann has
seen, a compound of ván, 'the forest' (comp. the genitive vanâ´m, the
locative vá*m*su), and of ád. Of Agni is said several times 'vánâni
atti.'

Note <span id="an_2:4:5:3">3</span>. On the mythical ancestors
designated as the U*s*i*g*as, see Bergaigne, I, 57 seq.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_2:4:6:1">1</span>. The forests, of course, are the
fuel.

Note <span id="an_2:4:6:2">2</span>. To ráthyâ-iva probably *k*akrâ´
(nom. plur.) is to be supplied.

Note <span id="an_2:4:6:3">3</span>. The 'laughing' of the sky is the
lightning (Benfey, Vedica und Verwandtes, 138). The flames of Agni flash
through the smoke as the lightning shines in the clouds.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_2:4:7:1">1</span>. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, II,
29 seq.; Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländ. Gesellschaft,
XLVIII, 107.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_2:4:8:1">1</span>. The text has t*ri*tî´ye vidáthe
(comp. I, 31, 6, note 2). Does this mean at the t*ri*tîya-savana? Three
vidathas are spoken of also in VI, 51, 2; VII, 66, 10.

Note <span id="an_2:4:8:2">2</span>. On the metrical irregularity, comp.
H. O., Die Hymnen des Rig-veda, I, 67.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_2:4:9:1">1</span>. 'May prevail, destroying through
thee the neighbours lying in ambush.' M. M. To me gúhâ seems to be
connected with vanvánta*h*.
