### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 8.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 29.

1\. As one who runs a race [1](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:1:1) (praises.md) his
chariots, praise thou the yoking of Agni (to the chariot of sacrifice),
of the most glorious, bountiful (god)—

2\. Who is the best leader for his worshipper, who undecaying makes the
malign decay [1](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:2:1.md), the cheerful-faced who has
been worshipped with offerings—

3\. He who is praised in the houses on account of his beauty in the
evening and at dawn, whose law is not set at nought,

4\. The bright one who shines with his light as the Sun with his
splendour, with his undecaying (flames) [1](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:4:1.md), he
who is anointed (with gh*ri*ta).

5\. The hymns have strengthened Agni the
devourer [1](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:5:1) along (the extent of.md) his own
royalty [2](sbe46058.htm#an_2:8:5:2.md). He has assumed every beauty.

6\. May we unharmed stand under the protection of Agni, Indra, Soma, of
the gods; may we overcome our foes.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is G*ri*tsamada; the metre is Gâyatrî, the last verse being
Anush*t*ubh, as is frequently the case in Gâyatrî hymns (see H. O.,
Hymnen des Rig-veda, I, 146).—No verse occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:8:1:1">1</span>. Vâ*g*ayáti means 'he strives for
vâ*g*a,' vâ*g*áyati 'he incites to quickness.' The accent is not always
correct in the traditional text.

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_2:8:2:1">1</span>. Comp. II, 16, 1. índram a*g*uryám
*g*aráyantam.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_2:8:4:1">1</span>. As to a*g*árai*h*, 'the undecaying
(flames),' comp. III, 18, 2; VI, 5, 4; 6, 2; VII, 3, 3; X, 87, 20.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:8:5:1">1</span>. That Agni should be identified here
with the *Ri*shi Atri (see Bergaigne, II, 468) is very improbable.
Possibly átri means simply 'the eater' (from ad), though the poet in
calling him so may have intended to allude to the name of the *Ri*shi.

Note <span id="an_2:8:5:2">2</span>. Comp. I, 80, I seq. ár*k*an ánu
svarâ´*g*yam; 84, 10 seq. vásvî*h* ánu svarâ´*g*yam.
