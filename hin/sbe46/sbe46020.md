### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 70.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 14.

1\. May we, the poor [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:1:1), succeed in many
(pious) thoughts [2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:1:2). May Agni with his pure
splendour attain everything—

2\. He who understands the divine laws and the birth of the human race.

3\. He who is the child of the waters, the child of the trees, the child
of that which stands, and the child of that which moves.

4\. Even in the rock (they have done homage \[?\]) to him, in his
dwelling [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:4:1). (He is) like a protector
\[?\] [2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:4:2) of the clans, the immortal one, he
who is of a good mind.

5\. For he, Agni, (shows himself as) an earth-protecting (lord) of
riches [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:5:1) to the man who satisfies him with
well-spoken (prayers).

6\. Protect, O knowing one, these beings, thou who knowest the birth of
gods and men [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:6:1).

7\. He whom many nights (and dawns), in their different
forms [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:7:1), may increase, whom that which
moves [2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:7:2) and that which stands (increases),
the god penetrated by *Ri*ta—

8\. That Hot*ri* who has sat down in the
sun [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:8:1), has been successfully
worshipped [2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:8:2) (by the human sacrificers), he
who truly accomplishes all his works.

9\. On the cows, on the trees thou hast conferred excellence. May all
men bring us tribute in the sun [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:9:1).

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

10\. In many places men have worshipped thee. They have brought (thee)
to different places [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:10:1) as sons (divide) the
property of an aged father [2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:10:2).

11 [1](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:11:1). (He is) like a greedy
man [2](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:11:2) who goes straight (to his aim), like
a mighty archer, like a fearful avenger
\[?\] [3](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:11:3), impetuous in
contests [4](sbe46020.htm#an_1:70:11:4).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:70:1:1">1</span>. I adopt Bergaigne's opinion on the
word arí (see Religion Védique, II, 218 seq.).

Note <span id="an_1:70:1:2">2</span>. The Padapâ*th*a has manîshâ´
instead of manîshâ´*h*. See my Prolegomena, 385; Lanman, 363. Prof. Max
Müller proposes to translate: 'May we by wisdom overcome many enemies!'
He writes: 'Is not vanema almost a standing formula as applied to
enemies? Let us conquer the enemies. The enemies are masculine in VII,
48, 3. ví*s*vân aryá*h* … vanvan, feminine in VI, 16, 27. vanvánta*h*
aryá*h* árâtî*h*. VIII, 39, 2. ví*s*vâ*h* aryá*h* árâtî*h*. X, 133, 3.
ví*s*vâ*h* árâtaya*h* aryá*h*. IV, 50, 11. *g*a*g*astám aryá*h* vanúshâm
árâtî*h* (repeated VII, 97, 9; cf. I, 29, 4).' For my translation I
refer to II, 5, 7. stómam … vanéma; II, 11, 12. dhíyam vanema; I, 122,
14. aryá*h* gíra*h*; X, 148, 3. aryá*h* vâ gíra*h* abhí ar*k*a vidvâ´n.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:70:4:1">1</span>. Or: even in the rock (they have
done homage) to him, and in the (human) dwelling? I believe we must
supply a verb on which the dative asmai depends. Ludwig proposes to read
duro*n*ám: 'within the stone is his dwelling.' Comp. II, 1, 1; VI, 48,
5.

Note <span id="an_1:70:4:2">2</span>. I do not understand vi*s*â´m ná
ví*s*va*h*. Ludwig translates 'er ist der menschen allgemeiner,
unsterblicher

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

fürsorger.' But ví*s*va does not mean 'allgemein,' and Ludwig omits ná,
'like.' One should expect a phrase like vi*s*â´m ná vi*s*páti*h*, which
of course is metrically impossible. Is it too bold to correct ví*s*va*h*
into vi*s*pâ´*h*, a word hitherto not found in the texts, but formed
exactly like stipâ´, pa*s*upâ´, tanûpâ´ and others?—Prof. Max Müller
takes asmai as dependent on svâdhî´*h* and ví*s*va*h* as belonging at
the same time to am*rí*ta*h* and to vi*s*â´m. He translates: 'To him
also who dwells in the rock and in the house, every immortal like every
one among men is well disposed.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:70:5:1">1</span>. Comp. VII, 10, 5. sá hí kshápâvân
ábhavat rayî*n*â´m.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:70:6:1">1</span>. Most probably we have here not the
accusative mártân but the genitive mártâm, which was confounded by the
arrangers of the traditional text with the accusative and treated
according to the Sandhi rules which govern the ending -ân. See . Lanman,
Noun-Inflection, 353 Bartholomae, Studien zur indogermanischen
Sprachgeschichte, I, 48.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:70:7:1">1</span>. Lanman (p. 422) takes kshapá*h*
vírûpâ*h* as accusatives, and translates, 'Whom through many nights and
mornings all beings worship.' I believe that they are nominatives, and
that we should accentuate kshápa*h*. As vírûpa is a regular epithet of
náktoshâ´sâ, I think that kshápa*h* is to be understood as an elliptic
plural similar to the elliptic duals ushâ´sâ or áhanî (comp. Delbrück,
Altindische Syntax, 102), and that it means, 'the nights (and
mornings).'—Comp. VI, 38, 4. várdhân mâ´sâ*h* *s*aráda*h* dyâ´va*h*
índram, 'May months, years, days increase Indra's greatness.'

Note <span id="an_1:70:7:2">2</span>. Of course *k*a rátham is a mistake
for karátham, as first pointed out by Benfey.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:70:8:1">1</span>. On the locative sṽar, see Lanman,
488; Joh. Schmidt in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 306; Bartholomae in
Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 42. Comp. X, 61, 14. sṽa*h* ná yé
trishadhasthé nishedú*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:70:8:2">2</span>. Comp. X, 53, 2. árâdhi hótâ
nishádâ yá*g*îyân.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:70:9:1">1</span>. Is it not more probable that
tribute was brought to Agni (comp. V, 1, 10) than to the human
worshippers? Possibly we should change sṽa*h* na*h* (sṽar *n*a*h* of the
Sa*m*hitâpâ*th*a) into svar*n*a*h*, a vocative of the stem sṽar*nri* =
sṽar*n*ara. The translation would be, 'All men have brought tribute to
thee, O sun-hero!'

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:70:10:1">1</span>. Comp. V, 11, 4. agním nára*h* ví
bharante g*ri*hég*ri*he.

Note <span id="an_1:70:10:2">2</span>. Regarding the metre, comp. above,
69, 8, note 1.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_1:70:11:1">1</span>. This verse may possibly be a
later addition. See Bergaigne, Recherches sur l’Histoire de la
Sa*m*hitâ, I, 61.

Note <span id="an_1:70:11:2">2</span>. On g*ri*dhnú, comp. Pischel, Ved.
Studien, I, 231.

Note <span id="an_1:70:11:3">3</span>. Comp. I, 32, 14. áhe*h* yâtâ´ram.

Note <span id="an_1:70:11:4">4</span>. See above, 66, 6.
