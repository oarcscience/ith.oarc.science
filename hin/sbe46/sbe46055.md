### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 5.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 26.

1\. The brilliant Hot*ri* [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:1:1.md) has been
born [2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:1:2.md), the father to protect the
fathers [3](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:1:3.md), aspiring after noble wealth. May
we be able to bridle the strong (horse) [4](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:1:4.md).

2\. He the leader of the sacrifice towards whom the seven reins (or
rays) are stretched, the Pot*ri* promotes, as (he has done) for Manu,
the divine eighth (rein); all those (reins he
promotes) [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:2:1.md).

3\. Or when he has run along, and has recited the sacred
words [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:3:1.md), and has pursued that
(duty) [2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:3:2.md), he has encompassed every kind of
wisdom as the felly (encircles) the wheel.

4\. For He has been born as the bright Pra*s*âst*ri*, with bright power
of mind. (A man) who knows his firm laws, mounts up on them as on the
branches (of a tree) [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:4:1.md).

5\. The lively milch-cows were attached to his, the Nesh*tri*'s,
(bright) colour [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:5:1.md). Was it according to the
wish of the three sisters who have gone
there [2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:5:2.md)?

6\. When (coming) from the mother the sister has approached, bringing
gh*ri*ta [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:6:1.md), the Adhvaryu rejoices at
their [2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:6:2) coming as corn (rejoices.md) at rain.

7\. May He the *Ri*tvi*g* (priest) himself make the Ritvi*g* (serve) for
his own refreshment [1](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:7:1.md). And may we readily
gain the praise and the sacrifice [2](sbe46055.htm#an_2:5:7:2.md); we have
offered it.

8\. In order that He the knowing one (Agni) may readily serve all the
worshipful (gods), this sacrifice, O Agni, which we have performed,
rests in thee.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Anush*t*ubh.—Verse 3 = SV. I, 94; TS. III, 3,
3, 3; MS. II, 13, 5.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:5:1:1">1</span>. As the Hot*ri* is mentioned here,
the following verses contain each the names of the other priests as
given in II, 1, 2. Only the Agnîdh is left out; possibly the words
svá*h* svâ´ya dhâ´yase kri*n*utâ´m *ri*tvík *ri*tví*g*am (verse 7)
contain an allusion to this priest, who may well be termed the
*Ri*tvi*g* belonging to Agni and refreshing him.

Note <span id="an_2:5:1:2">2</span>. With the first Pâda of our verse,
compare IX, 64, 10. índu*h* pavish*t*a *k*étana*h*.

Note <span id="an_2:5:1:3">3</span>. The meaning seems to be: Agni, who
has protected the fathers, has been born again, and will do the same for
the present sacrificer.

Note <span id="an_2:5:1:4">4</span>. The strong horse, of course, is
Agni. Comp. III, 27, 3 (see below). On the construction (vâ*g*ína*h*
yámam), see Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 417.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_2:5:2:1">1</span>. On the seven rays or reins of Agni,
see I, 146, 1, note 1. Besides the seven priests a mysterious eighth
*Ri*tvi*g* priest is spoken of (X, 114, 9. kám *ri*tví*g*âm ash*t*amám
*s*û´ram âhu*h*); thus Agni has a mysterious eighth ra*s*mí (ray or
rein) besides the seven. Comp. Bergaigne, Religion Védique, II, 144.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_2:5:3:1">1</span>. Vó*k*at bráhmâ*n*i: this seems to
be an allusion to the Brahman priest (see verse 1, note 1).

Note <span id="an_2:5:3:2">2</span>. Vé*h* is third singular. See Joh.
Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 91.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_2:5:4:1">1</span>. Comp. VIII, 13, 6. vayâ´*h*-iva ánu
rohate. Prof.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Max Müller (vol.
xxxii, p. 207) translates, 'springs up like young sprouts.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:5:5:1">1</span>. It is the Nesh*tri*'s office to
lead the wife of the sacrificer to the place where the sacrifice is
being performed. Thus Agni, the divine Nesh*tri*, is represented as
accompanied by female beings, by the 'milch-cows,' meaning the oblations
of gh*ri*ta, &c., or possibly the dawns.

Note <span id="an_2:5:5:2">2</span>. Are the 'three sisters' (comp.
Bergaigne, 1, 321; II, 107) identical with the milch-cows spoken of in
the first hemistich? Ludwig (vol. iv, p. 166) very appropriately calls
attention to the fact that three cows were milked at the sacrifice of
the full and the new moon. Comp. Hillebrandt, Altindisches Neu- and
Vollmondsopfer, p. 12 seq. Three dawns are mentioned in VIII, 41, 3.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_2:5:6:1">1</span>. The sister bringing gh*ri*ta seems
to be the sacrificial spoon. Is the mother the milk-vessel or possibly
the cow?

Note <span id="an_2:5:6:2">2</span>. Does 'their' refer to the mother
and the sister (cf. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 102)? Or are 'the
three sisters who have gone there' referred to?

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_2:5:7:1">1</span>. The one *Ri*tvi*g* is Agni; the
other possibly is the Agnîdh who refreshes the Ritvi*g* Agni. See verse
1, note 1.

Note <span id="an_2:5:7:2">2</span>. After â´t we should expect, instead
of áram, another accusative, possibly *rík*am (see VII, 66, 11): 'may we
master the praise, the sacrifice, and the verse.' Áram may have found
its way into the text from verse 8.
