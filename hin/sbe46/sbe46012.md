### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 58.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 23–24.

1\. The strength-begotten immortal never grows
tired [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:1:1.md), when he, the Hot*ri*, has become
the messenger of Vivasvat [2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:1:2.md). He passes
through the air on the best paths. In the divine world he invites (the
gods) with the sacrificial food.

2\. Seizing his own food the undecaying, greedy (Agni) stands on the
brushwood wishing to drink. When he has been sprinkled (with ghee), he
shines like a racer with his back [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:2:1.md).
Thundering he has roared like the ridge of heaven.

3\. As soon as [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:3:1.md) the Rudras, the Vasus have
made him their Purohita, the immortal sitting down as Hot*ri*, the
conqueror of wealth, pressing forward like a chariot among the clans,
among the Âyus [2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:3:2.md), the god in due course
discloses desirable boons.

4\. Stirred by the wind he spreads among the brushwood
lightly [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:4:1),(driven forward.md) by the
sacrificial ladles, with his sickle [2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:4:2.md),
loudly roaring. When thou, O Agni, thirstily rushest on the wooden
sticks like a bull [3](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:4:3.md), thy course, O
never-aging god with fiery waves, becomes
black [4](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:4:4.md).

5\. He who has fiery jaws, stirred by the wind, blazes down on the
forest [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:5:1) as a strong bull (rushes.md) on the
herd. When he proceeds [2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:5:2.md) with his stream of
light to the imperishable atmosphere, then what is moveable and
immoveable (and) the winged (birds) are afraid.

6\. The Bh*ri*gus have placed thee among men, who art beautiful like a
treasure, who art easy to

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

invoke for people; thee the Hot*ri*, O Agni, the excellent guest, a
delightful friend like Mitra to the divine race!

7\. I worship with good cheer Agni the
steward [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:7:1.md) of all treasures, whom the seven
ladles [2](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:7:2) (of the priests.md), the worshippers
choose as the Hot*ri*, the best sacrificer at the rites, and I pray for
treasure [3](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:7:3.md).

8\. Son of strength, great like Mitra, grant to-day flawless protection
to us who magnify thee. Agni! guard from distress with strongholds of
iron him who praises thee, O offspring of vigour!

9\. Be a shelter to him who praises thee, O resplendent one; be
protection, generous giver, to the generous. Agni! guard him who praises
thee from distress. May he who gives wealth for our prayer, come quickly
in the morning [1](sbe46012.htm#an_1:58:9:1.md).

#### NOTES.

The hymn is ascribed to Nodhas Gautama, who is considered as the *Ri*shi
of the whole collection, I, 58–64. This tradition is based on, and
confirmed by, several passages of the text: I, 61, 14; 62, 13; 64, 1.

The metre is *G*agatî verses 1–5, Trish*t*ubh verses 6–9. None of the
verses of this hymn occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:58:1:1">1</span>. I believe that Professor Aufrecht
(Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 435) is right in reading nû´ *k*it
saha*h*-*g*â´*h* am*rí*ta*h* nú tandate. Comp. as to nû´ *k*it nú, I,
120, 2; VI, 37, 3; VII, 22, 8. Agni is frequently called átandra*h*
dûtá*h* or similarly. Possibly we might read, instead of nú tandate, ní
tandate, though parallel passages for the combination of this root with
ní are not known.—Prof. Max

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Müller's opinion
is different. He writes: We say, der Funke schlägt oder fängt. Why
should not the Hindu have said that Agni strikes out. That would be vi
tundate, Agni schlägt aus im Augenblick. But even ni tundate may have
been used in the sense of the spark striking down on the tinder—the
atasâs, mentioned in verse 2—which he ignites. I should translate: 'The
strength-begotten immortal strikes down or breaks forth (vi) quickly,
whenever the Hot*ri* (Agni) becomes the messenger of the sacrificer
(?).'

Note <span id="an_1:58:1:2">2</span>. I cannot follow Aufrecht in his
translation 'zum boten des opfernden.' Comp. on Agni as the messenger of
Vivasvat, Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, I, 87; H. O., Religion des Veda, 122,
275.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:58:2:1">1</span>. Literally, his back shines like a
racer. On this kind of comparison, see Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier, 86;
Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 107.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:58:3:1">1</span>. Krâ*n*â´: comp. von Bradke, Dyâus
Asura, Ahura Mazdâ und die Asuras, p. 36; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I,
70.

Note <span id="an_1:58:3:2">2</span>. Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, I, 59
seq.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:58:4:1">1</span>. On v*rí*thâ, see Geldner, Vedische
Studien, I, 116; Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XIX, 148 seq.

Note <span id="an_1:58:4:2">2</span>. The meaning is: with his flames
which are sharp like a sickle. S*rín*i is written here as a paroxytonon;
in several other passages it is an oxytonon. Such differences are not
quite rare, and there is no reason for taking on this account s*rín*yâ
as an instr. plur. fem. of the adjective s*rín*ya, 'mit verkürzter
Endung' (Geldner, loc. cit.). 'His sickle is the sharp edge of Agni.'
M. M.—On *g*uhû´bhi*h*, comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 111.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

Note <span id="an_1:58:4:3">3</span>. As to v*ri*shâyáse with the
accusative, comp. Gaedicke, 74. RV. X, 44, 4. ûr*g*á*h* skambhám …
v*ri*shâyase.

Note <span id="an_1:58:4:4">4</span>. With the last Pâda comp. IV, 7, 9.
k*ri*sh*n*ám te éma rû*s*ata*h* purá*h* bhâ´*h*.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:58:5:1">1</span>. That is, among the fuel.

Note <span id="an_1:58:5:2">2</span>. I think that we have here
probably—(though, of course, this explanation can be avoided)—an
anacoluthon. The poet began with the nominative (abhivrá*g*an), and then
he changed the construction and went on as if he had begun with the
ablative, taking sthâtú*h* *k*arátham (comp. Lanman, 422) as the subject
instead of Agni.—Patatrí*n*a*h* seems to be nom. pl.; comp. I, 94, 11
(see below).

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:58:7:1">1</span>. The translation of aratí is only
approximative and conjectural.

Note <span id="an_1:58:7:2">2</span>. Comp. Pischel, Ved. Studien, II,
113.

Note <span id="an_1:58:7:3">3</span>. Comp. III, 54, 3. saparyâ´mi
práyasâ yâ´mi rátnam.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:58:9:1">1</span>. The last Pâda is the standing
conclusion of the Nodhas hymns.
