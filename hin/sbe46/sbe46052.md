### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 2.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 20–21.

1\. Increase *G*âtavedas by your sacrifice [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:1:1.md),
worship Agni for ever with your offering and your
prayer [2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:1:2.md)—him who has been kindled, the
receiver of good offerings, the solar hero, the heavenly Hot*ri*, the
charioteer [3](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:1:3.md) in our
settlements [4](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:1:4.md).

2\. For thee Nights and Dawns have been lowing, O Agni, as milch-cows in
the folds for their calf [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:2:1.md). A
steward [2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:2:2.md), as it were, of Heaven, thou
shinest on the human tribes, O bountiful one, on continuous
nights [3](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:2:3.md).

3\. The gods have set him to work, as a
steward [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:3:1.md) of Heaven and Earth, endowed with
wonderful power, at the bottom of the air: Agni who is well known like a
chariot [2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:3:2.md), brightly shining, deserving of
praise like Mitra (or, like a friend) in (human) dwellings.

4\. They have established him who grows in the air, in his house, the
serpent [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:4:1.md) with beautiful splendour like
gold [2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:4:2), the winged (son?.md) of
P*ris*ni [3](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:4:3.md) who lights up with his eyes both
tribes (of gods and of men), like a guardian of the way
(?) [4](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:4:4.md).

5\. May he, the Hot*ri*, encompass the whole sacrifice. Men strive
towards him with offerings and prayer. (Agni) with golden
jaws [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:5:1.md), hurrying around in the growing
(plants) [2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:5:2.md), lighted up the two worlds like
the Sky with the stars.

6\. Thus mayst thou, being brightly kindled for our welfare or being
exhausted (?) [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:6:1.md), shine upon us with thy
wealth. Carry hither to us the two

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

worlds for the sake of happiness, Agni, O god, that they may eagerly
partake [2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:6:2.md) of the offering of the man (or, of
Manus).

7\. Give us, Agni, mighty, give us thousandfold (gifts). Open strength
for us like a door [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:7:1.md) for the sake of glory.
Make Heaven and Earth inclined towards us through (our) spell. Make the
Dawns shine like the brilliant Sun.

8\. Being kindled after dawns and nights may he shine with his red light
like the sun, Agni, being a good sacrificer with the help of the
offerings of man (or, of Manus) [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:8:1.md), the king
of the clans, and the welcome guest of Âyu.

9\. Thus, O Agni, ancient one, our human prayer has prospered among the
immortals who dwell in the great heaven. May the
cow [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:9:1.md) when milked,
yield [2](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:9:2.md) freely to the singer in our
settlements hundredfold (wealth) of all kinds.

10\. May we, O Agni, (attain) bliss in valiant men by our racers, or may
we shine over (all) people by our sacred spells. May our unconquerable
lustre beam on high like the sun over the fivefold dwellings (of the
five peoples).

11\. Be thou, O mighty one, worthy of praise among us, (thou) from whom
the well-born, liberal (lords) have sought
nourishment [1](sbe46052.htm#an_2:2:11:1.md), unto whom the strong ones, O
Agni, go for sacrifice, who shinest in thy abode among (the
worshipper's) own kith.

12\. May we both, O *G*âtavedas, the praisers and the liberal (lords),
be in thy protection, O Agni. Help us to good, resplendent, abundant
wealth which is accompanied by offspring, by good progeny.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 7 = TS. II, 2, 12, 6; MS. IV, 12, 2.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:2:1:1">1</span>. In this Pâda one syllable is
wanting. It may be thought that the first word should be pronounced
ia*gñ*éna. For supplying the missing syllable by conjecture there would,
however, be many ways. Comp. also H. O., Hymnen des Rig-veda, I, p. 79.

Note <span id="an_2:2:1:2">2</span>. Tánâ girâ´: comp. I. 38, 13 (vol.
xxxii, p. 82).

Note <span id="an_2:2:1:3">3</span>. Dhû*h*-sádam. The exact meaning is,
'who occupies a decisive position.'

Note <span id="an_2:2:1:4">4</span>. V*rig*áneshu: comp. I, 60, 3, note
2.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_2:2:2:1">1</span>. Comp. VIII, 88, 1. abhí vatsám ná
svásareshu dhenáva*h* índram gîrbhí*h* navâmahe.

Note <span id="an_2:2:2:2">2</span>. See I, 58, 7, note 1.

Note <span id="an_2:2:2:3">3</span>. See Lanman, p. 482; Gaedicke, p.
89. 'During continuous nights.' M. M.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_2:2:3:1">1</span>. See I, 58, 7, note 1.

Note <span id="an_2:2:3:2">2</span>. Cf. VIII, 84, 1. rátham ná védyam.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_2:2:4:1">1</span>. I follow the conjecture of
Böhtlingk-Roth, who propose to read hvârám. Comp. Atharva-veda IV, I, 2
(Â*s*valâyana *S*rautasûtra IV, 6, 3; *S*âṅkhâyana *S*rautasûtra V, 9,
7). surú*k*am hvârám. The meaning of the word is conjectural; comp. I,
141, 7, note 1. If we read hvâré, the translation could be 'brilliant
like gold, in a hidden place.' (M. M.)

Note <span id="an_2:2:4:2">2</span>. Comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, I,
52.

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

Note <span id="an_2:2:4:3">3</span>. Or, the winged (bird) of P*ris*ni?
No other passages which make Agni the son (or the bird) of P*ris*ni are
known to me.

Note <span id="an_2:2:4:4">4</span>. The accent of pâthás points to a
genitive, dependent on pâyúm, of a word which is, however, different
from pâ´thas. Grassmann thinks that pâthás is a lengthening for pathás,
but Lanman (Noun-Inflection, 470) is quite right in observing that this
is hard to believe in the first syllable of a Pâda. Should we not
correct the text and read pathá*h* (gen. sing. governed by pâyúm)? The
reading pâthá*h* may be due to the influence of the neighbourhood of
pâyúm.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:2:5:1">1</span>. See vol. xxxii, p. 301.

Note <span id="an_2:2:5:2">2</span>. Comp. X, 92, I. *s*úshkâsu
hári*n*îshu *g*árbhurat.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_2:2:6:1">1</span>. Ludwig translates sam-dadasvâ´n:
'zum heile \[dich selber\] aufreibend;' Grassmann, 'oder seist erloschen
du;' Gaedicke (p. 89), 'and wenn du verlöschest;' Griffith, 'a liberal
giver;' Neisser (Bezzenberger's Beitr. XIX, 286), 'deine Kunst
zusammennehmend.' Sâya*n*a says, 'sa*m*dadasvân samyak praya*kkh*an.'
Prof. Max Müller suggests, 'being a liberal benefactor.'

Note <span id="an_2:2:6:2">2</span>. There was no reason for correcting
devá-vîtaye as Ludwig once proposed. He has himself abandoned this
conjecture.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_2:2:7:1">1</span>. As to this metaphor ('opening'
strength or the like), comp. VIII, 5, 21. utá na*h* divyâ´*h* ísha*h* …
ápa dvâ´râiva varshatha*h*, and the passages collected by Dr. Hirzel,
Gleichnisse and Metaphern im Rig-veda (Leipzig, 1890), 103.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_2:2:8:1">1</span>. The third Pâda is repeated in X,
11, 5.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_2:2:9:1">1</span>. The milch-cow of course is the
prayer.

Note <span id="an_2:2:9:2">2</span>. Ishá*n*i seems to be an infinitive
like parshá*n*i neshá*n*i tarîshá*n*i (Delbrück, Altindisches Verbum,
227; Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XX, 43). I believe it to come
from the root ish, 'to incite.' As to the syntactical peculiarities of
these infinitives, comp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, 416.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_2:2:11:1">1</span>. Ishay is a denominative from ísh,
as ûr*g*ay is derived from û´r*g* (comp. Â*s*valâyana *S*rautasûtra V,
7, 3).
