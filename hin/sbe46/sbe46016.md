### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 66.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 10.

1\. Like unto excellent wealth, like unto the shine of the sun, like
unto living breath, like unto one's own [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:1:1)
son—

2\. Like unto a quick takvan [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:2:1) he (Agni)
holds the wood, like milk, like a milch
cow [2](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:2:2), bright and shining.

3\. He holds safety, pleasant like a homestead, like ripe barley, a
conqueror of men,

4\. Like a *Ri*shi uttering (sacred) shouts, praised among the clans;
like a well-cared-for race-horse [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:4:1), Agni
bestows vigour.

5\. He to whose flame men do not grow
accustomed [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:5:1), who is like one's own
mind [2](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:5:2), like a wife on a couch, enough for
all (happiness).

6\. When the bright (Agni) has shone forth, he is like a white (horse
\[?\]) [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:6:1) among people, like a chariot with
golden ornaments, impetuous in fights.

7\. Like an army which is sent forward he shows his vehemence, like an
archer's shaft with sharp point.

8\. He who is born is one twin; he who will be
born [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:8:1) is the other twin—the lover of
maidens, the husband of wives [2](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:8:2).

9 [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:9:1). As cows go to their stalls, all that
moves and we, for the sake of a dwelling, reach him who has been
kindled.

10\. Like the flood of the Sindhu [1](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:10:1) he has
driven forward the downwards-flowing
(waters) [2](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:10:2). The cows lowed at the sight of
the sun [3](sbe46016.htm#an_1:66:10:3).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:66:1:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 166, 2; 185, 2; X, 39,
14. The second passage (nítyam ná sûnúm pitró*h* upásthe dyâ´vâ
rákshatam p*ri*thivî na*h* ábhvât) would be sufficient to show that we
cannot translate 'wie ein überlebender sohn' (Ludwig).

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:66:2:1">1</span>. We do not know what animal the
takvan is. Comp. I, 134, 5 with M. M.’s note.

Note <span id="an_1:66:2:2">2</span>. See Bergaigne, Mél. Renier, 101;
Gaedicke, 253.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:66:4:1">1</span>. Comp. X, 101, 7. prî*n*îtá á*s*vân
hitám *g*ayâtha.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:66:5:1">1</span>. Comp. VII, 4, 3. durókam agní*h*
âyáve *s*u*s*o*k*a.

Note <span id="an_1:66:5:2">2</span>. Prof. Max Müller believes that
kratu here means, 'like kart*ri*, a sacrificer, so that kratu*h* na
nitya*h* sounds like sûnu*h* na nitya*h*, one's own sacrificing son. But
all this is very obscure.'

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:66:6:1">1</span>. The second Pâda is translated by
Grassmann: 'wie Licht in Häusern;' by Ludwig: 'fast weiss, bei den
menschenstämmen.' I think that there can be no doubt that the words
*s*vetá*h* ná contain a comparison like all the other comparisons of
which these hymns are full; this comparison is unduly effaced in
Ludwig's translation. Nor is Grassmann right in translating *s*vetá*h*
bei 'Licht;' the word is an adjective meaning 'white' and nothing else.
We must supply here, as in many passages, a substantive, and I do not
see any reason why this should not be that

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

substantive with which *s*veta is most frequently combined in the
Rig-veda, namely a*s*va; comp. I, 116, 6; 118, 9 \[119, 10\]; VII, 77,
3; X, 39, 10. In V, 1, 4 it is said of Agni: svetá*h* vâ*g*î´ *g*âyate
ágre áhnâm, 'the white racer is born in the beginning of the days.'

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:66:8:1">1</span>. The traditional text is yamá*h* ha
*g*âtá*h* yamá*h* *g*ánitvam. Ludwig translates 'bewältiger des
gebornen, bewältiger auch des, was erst geboren wird.' It will scarcely
be necessary to state the reasons which make against this translation.
Yamá*h* … yamá*h* evidently means: 'the one twin … the other twin.' Now
if we leave the text unchanged, we cannot but translate: 'the one twin
is he who has been born, the other twin is that which will be
born'—which sounds very strange. In I, 89, to we have áditi*h* *g*âtám
áditi*h* *g*ánitvam; IV, 18, 4. antá*h* *g*âtéshu utá yé *g*ánitvâ*h*;
X, 45, 10. út *g*âténa bhinádat út *g*ánitvai*h*. In all these cases
*g*âtá and *g*ánitva stand parallel; there is no such difference as in
our passage, according to the traditional text, between him (masc.) who
is … and that (neuter) which will be … Thus I propose to read
*g*ánitva*h*, of which conjecture Ludwig has thought also (see his note,
IV, 259): that present Agni who has been born, and that future Agni who
will be born, are twins.—Prof. Max Müller has discussed this passage in
his Science of Language, II, 630 seqq. He interprets the twin who has
been born as Agni representing the morning; the twin who will be born as
the evening.

Note <span id="an_1:66:8:2">2</span>. The maidens very probably are the
dawns (comp. Prof. Max Müller's discussion quoted in the last note). Are
the wives the sacrificial ladles which approach Agni, or the offerings
of ghee, or the prayers? See Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, II, 9 seqq.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:66:9:1">1</span>. This verse is very obscure, and I
am quite aware of the merely tentative character of the translation
which

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I propose. I leave
va*h* untranslated (comp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, 206), which must
be done in most of the numerous verses beginning with the words tám
va*h*. I then read *k*arathâ (comp. 68, 1; 70, 3. 7). Vasatyâ´ seems to
be either a dative similar to the newly-discovered datives in -â of
a-stems, or we possibly should read vasatyaí (vasatyâ´ in the
Sa*m*hitâ-pâ*th*a).—Prof. Max Müller thinks of a correction *k*arâma*h*
and would translate: 'To him (whom you know—va*h*) when lighted we go
for our dwelling, as the cows reach their home.'

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:66:10:1">1</span>. Comp. above, 65, 6.

Note <span id="an_1:66:10:2">2</span>. Or the downwards-streaming
libations of Gh*ri*ta and the like? Comp. below, I, 72, 10 with note 4.

Note <span id="an_1:66:10:3">3</span>. Comp. below, 69, 10.
