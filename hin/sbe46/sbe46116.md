### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 12.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 4.

1\. To the mighty, sacrificial Agni, to the bull of
*Ri*ta [1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:1:1.md), the Asura, I bring this prayer and
this song, which is turned towards him, to (him) the bull, as
well-clarified gh*ri*ta (is poured) into his mouth at the sacrifice.

2\. O knower of *Ri*ta, know the *Ri*ta! Bore for many streams of
*Ri*ta. I (do) not (serve) a Yâtu [1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:2:1.md) by
violence nor by falsehood; I serve the *Ri*ta of the red
bull [2](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:2:2.md).

3\. How, O Agni, performing the *Ri*ta through *Ri*ta, mayst thou become
a witness of our newest [1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:3:1.md) hymn? The god, the
protector of the seasons, knows of my
seasons [2](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:3:2). I (do) not (know another.md) lord
but him who attains (for us) this wealth.

4\. Who, O Agni, are thy fetterers to (fetter) the
impostor [1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:4:1.md)? What brilliant guardians were
successful? Who, O Agni, drink the drink of falsehood? Who are the
protectors of untrue speech?

5\. These friends of thine, O Agni, turning themselves from
(thee) [1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:5:1.md), they who had been kind, have
become unkind. They have harmed themselves by their own speeches,
uttering wrong words to the righteous.

6\. He who magnifies thy sacrifice, O Agni, by adoration, and
serves [1](sbe46116.htm#an_5:12:6:1.md) the *Ri*ta of the red bull: may a
large, good dwelling come to him, to the offspring of the advancing
Nahusha.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi; the metre is Trish*t*ubh.—No verse of this hymn occurs
in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:12:1:1">1</span>. The genitive *ri*tásya seems to
depend on v*rí*sh*n*e, not on mánma. On the connection of Agni with the
*Ri*ta, see Bergaigne, III, 229 seq.; H. O., Religion des Veda, 201.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:12:2:1">1</span>. A bad demon.

Note <span id="an_5:12:2:2">2</span>. Of Agni.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:12:3:1">1</span>. I think that návya*h* stands for
návyasa*h*. Thus Ludwig translates: 'des neuen liedes.' It seems evident
that it is not the nominative of návya, 'praiseworthy' (Böhtlingk-Roth,
Grassmann).

Note <span id="an_5:12:3:2">2</span>. Probably we ought to read
*ri*tapâ´ *ri*tâ´nâm. Cf. IV, 23, 4. devá*h* bhuvat návedâ*h* me
ritâ´nâm, and see III, 20, 4, note 1 (above, [p.
282](sbe46080.htm#page_282).md). The translation will be: 'The god, the
protector of *Ri*ta, knows of my (deeds of) *Ri*ta.'

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:12:4:1">1</span>. Or ripáva*h*? 'Who, O Agni, are
the impostors who fetter thee?'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:12:5:1">1</span>. On víshu*n*â*h*, compare V, 34, 6:
ásunvata*h* víshu*n*a*h* sunvatá*h* v*ri*dhá*h*.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_5:12:6:1">1</span>. The second verse (*ri*tám sapâmi
arushásya v*rí*sh*n*a*h*) shows with evidence that for sá pâti we ought
to read sápâti (see Roth, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVI, 49, and compare on
the expression *ri*tam sap, Geldner, Vedische Studien, II, 135).
