### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 16.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 8.

1\. Sing [1](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:1:1) (a song that gives) mighty vital
power, to the light, to god Agni, whom the mortals have placed in
front [2](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:1:2) like Mitra by their
praises [3](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:1:3).

2\. For he, Agni, the Hot*ri* of men, day by day, in the arms of Daksha,
discloses the offering in the due way, as
Bhaga [1](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:2:1) (discloses) a treasure.

3\. (We abide \[?\]) in his praise, the liberal (god's), in his
friendship, the mightily brilliant one's, in whom, the loudly roaring
Aryan, all (beings) have put together their strength.

4\. For verily, O Agni, (thou belongest \[?\]) to
them [1](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:4:1) through thy
bounteousness [2](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:4:2) in (bestowing) abundance of
heroes. Him indeed, the vigorous one, his glory the two worlds could not
encompass [3](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:4:3).

5\. Now then, Agni, come hither and, being praised, bring
treasure [1](sbe46120.htm#an_5:16:5:1) to us who, we ourselves and our
liberal givers, may acquire welfare together. And help us to grow strong
in fights.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Pûru Âtreya (cf. 17, 1); the metre Anush*t*ubh (verse 5,
Paṅkti). This hymn and V, 17 are parallel hymns; the concluding words of
both are identical (see also V, 9, 7; 10, 7).—Verse 5 = SV. I, 88.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:16:1:1">1</span>. Ár*k*â may be first or second
person.

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

Note <span id="an_5:16:1:2">2</span>. Dadhiré purá*h*: they have made
him their Purohita.

Note <span id="an_5:16:1:3">3</span>. Comp. above, V, 9, 6.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:16:2:1">1</span>. On Bhaga, the divine Bestower or
Dispenser of riches, cf. Herbert Baynes. The Biography of Bhaga (Actes
du huitième Congrès intern. des Orientalistes, Sect. II, fasc. 1, pp. 83
seq.).

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:16:4:1">1</span>. To them, i. e. the Maghavans.
Compare below, 18, 3. 4.

Note <span id="an_5:16:4:2">2</span>. Ma*m*hánâ seems to be
instrumental. Comp. 10. 2; 18, 2.

Note <span id="an_5:16:4:3">3</span>. Agni is himself yahvá; so ná
cannot be the comparative particle, but it must be the negation.
Similarly it is said in II, 16, 3 that Heaven and Earth cannot encompass
the indriya of Indra; cf. also X, 27, 7.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:16:5:1">1</span>. Vâ´ryam seems to depend on â´
bhara. With the whole phrase compare the first Pâda of V, 17, 5.
