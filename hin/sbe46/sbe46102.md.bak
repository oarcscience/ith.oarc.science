### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 13.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 13.

1\. Benevolent Agni has looked on the breaking of the shining dawns, on
the bestowal of treasures. Come to the dwelling of the virtuous
(mortal), ye A*s*vins. The god Sûrya rises with his light.

2\. The god Savit*ri* has sent his light
upward [1](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:1.md), shaking his
banner [2](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:2.md) like a warrior who fights for
cows [3](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:3.md). Varu*n*a and Mitra follow the law,
when they make the Sun rise on heaven.

3\. Him whom (the gods) dwelling in firm peace, and never losing their
object, have created for dispersing the darkness—Him, the Sun, the
all-observer, the seven young fallow mares carry forward.

4\. With (thy horses) most ready to run thou
goest [1](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:4:1.md) forward, spreading out thy web (of
light), removing (from the world) the black cloth (of darkness), O god.
The rays of the Sun have shaken [2](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:4:2.md) the
darkness, and have sunk it into the waters like a hide.

5\. Unsupported, unattached, spread out downwards-turned—how is it that
he [1](sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:5:1.md) does not fall down? By what power of
his does he move? Who has seen (that)? Erected as the pillar of Heaven
he protects the firmament.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 4 = TB. II, 4, 5, 4.

This hymn and the next evidently form a couple. They have the same
number of verses, and are composed in the same metre. They are both
addressed to Agni in his matutinal character, or rather to the A*s*vins,
who are invoked to partake of the matutinal oblation (13, 1; 14, 1. 4).
The first verse of 13 is quite similar to that of 14; the same may be
said of the second verses of the two hymns; the concluding verse of both
is identical.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_4:13:2:1">1</span>. Cf. above, IV, 6, 2.

Note <span id="an_4:13:2:2">2</span>. Cf. Zend drafsha, 'banner.'

Note <span id="an_4:13:2:3">3</span>. Cf. IV, 40, 2. sátvâ bharishá*h*
gavishá*h*.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_4:13:4:1">1</span>. The Sun is addressed.

Note <span id="an_4:13:4:2">2</span>. It is more natural to take
dávidhvata*h* as nom. plur. than as gen. sing. (Ludwig).

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_4:13:5:1">1</span>. The Sun.
