### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 4.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 18–19.

1\. Thee, O Agni, the treasure-lord of treasures, I gladden at the
sacrifices, O king! May we, striving for gain, conquer gain through
thee; may we overcome the hostilities of mortals.

2\. Agni, the bearer of oblations, our ever-young father, is mighty,
brilliant, beautiful to behold among us. Shine (on us) food with a good
household [1](sbe46108.htm#an_5:4:2:1.md). Turn all glory towards
us [2](sbe46108.htm#an_5:4:2:2.md).

3\. Establish Agni as the Hot*ri*, the sage of the clans, the lord of
human clans, the bright purifier, whose back is covered with ghee, the
omniscient. May he obtain the best goods (for us) among the gods.

4\. Enjoy thyself, O Agni, joined with I*d*â, uniting thyself with the
rays of the sun. Enjoy our fuel, O *G*âtavedas, and bring the gods
hither that they may eat our offerings.

5\. Welcome, as our household-god and the guest in our dwelling, come to
this our sacrifice as the knowing one. Dispelling, O Agni, all (hostile)
attempts, bring to us the possessions of those who are at enmity with
us.

6\. Drive away the Dasyu with thy weapon, creating strength for thy own
body. When thou bringest the gods across (to us), O son of strength,
then, O manliest Agni, protect us in (our striving for) gain.

7\. May we worship thee, O Agni, with hymns, with offerings, O purifier
with glorious light. Stir for us wealth with all goods; bestow on us all
riches!

8\. Enjoy, O Agni, our sacrifice, our offering,

O son of strength who dwellest in three abodes. May we be well-doers
before the gods. Protect us with thy thrice-protecting shelter.

9\. Bring us across all difficulties and dangers,

8\. *G*âtavedas, as with a boat across a river. Agni, being praised with
adoration as (thou hast been praised) by Atri, be a protector of our
bodies.

10\. When I, the mortal, call thee, the immortal, thinking of thee with
humble mind [1](sbe46108.htm#an_5:4:10:1.md), bestow glory on us, O
*G*âtavedas; may I attain immortality, O Agni, with my offspring.

11\. The well-doer to whom thou, O Agni *G*âtavedas, createst pleasant
freedom, will happily attain wealth with horses and sons, with valiant
men and cows.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 1 = TS. I, 4, 46, 2. Verse 2 = TS.
III, 4, 11, 1; MS. IV, 12, 6; 14, 15. Verse 5 = AV. VII, 73, 9; TB. II,
4, 1, 1; MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 9 = TB. II, 4, 1, 5; TÂ. X, 2, 1; MS. IV,
10, 1. Verses 10, 11 = TS. I, 4, 46, 1.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:4:2:1">1</span>. According to the traditional text,
su-gârhapatyâ´*h* must be an epithet of ísha*h*. But the conjecture of
Böhtlingk-Roth, su-gârhapatyá*h*, has great probability 'as the good
protector of our household, shine food on us.' Cf. AV. XII, 2, 45 = TB.
I, 2, 1, 20.

Note <span id="an_5:4:2:2">2</span>. The second hemistich is nearly
identical with III, 54, 22.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_5:4:10:1">1</span>. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, I,
221.
