### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 95.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 7, VARGA 1–2.

1\. Two (sisters) of different shapes wander along, pursuing a good aim.
The one and the other suckles the calf [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:1:1.md).
With the one (the calf) is golden, moving according to its
wont [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:1:2.md). With the other it is seen clear,
full of fine splendour.

2\. The ten unwearied [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:2:1.md) young
women [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:2:2.md) have brought forth this
widely-spread germ of Tvash*tri* [3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:2:3.md). Him, the
sharp-faced (Agni) who is endowed with his own splendour, the shining
one, they [4](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:2:4.md) carry around among men.

3\. They celebrate his three births: one in the sea, one in heaven, one
in the waters [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:3:1.md). In the eastern
region [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:3:2.md) he commanding determines the
seasons of the dwellers on earth by his present
power [3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:3:3.md).

4\. Who among you has understood this hidden
(god)? [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:4:1.md) The calf has by itself given birth
to its mothers [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:4:2.md). The germ of many
(mothers), the great seer, moving by his own strength, comes forward
from the lap of the active ones [3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:4:3.md).

5 [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:5:1). The fair (child Agni.md) grows up visibly
in them in his own glory, standing erect in the lap of the
down-streaming (waters). Both (Heaven and Earth) fled away in fear of
(the son of) Tvash*tri* [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:5:2.md), when he was born,
but turning back they caress the lion.

6\. They caress him both, like two kind women; like lowing cows they
have approached him in their own way. He has become the lord of all

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

powers [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:6:1.md), he whom they anoint with
sacrificial gifts from the right side [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:6:2.md).

7\. He raises his arms again and again like
Savit*ri* [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:7:1.md). He the terrible pressing on
ranges both wings [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:7:2) (of his army.md). He raises
up his bright vesture from himself alone [3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:7:3.md).
He gives new garments to his mothers.

8\. He assumes his fierce appearance which is above (i. e. the
lightning?), being united with the cows [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:8:1.md),
the waters in his seat. The prayer purifies the bottom of the seer
(?) [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:8:2.md). This was the meeting among the
gods [3](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:8:3.md).

9\. The wide space encompasses thy base, the resplendent
foundation [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:9:1.md) of the buffalo. Agni! Being
kindled protect us with all thy undeceivable guardians who are endowed
with their own splendour.

10\. On the dry ground he produces a
stream [1](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:10:1.md), a course, a flood. With his
bright floods he reaches the earth. Whatever is old he receives into his
belly. He moves about within the young sprouting
grass [2](sbe46031.htm#an_1:95:10:2.md).

11\. Thus, O Agni, being strengthened by fuel, shine thou to us with
wealth-giving shine, O purifier, for the sake of glory. May Mitra and
Varu*n*a grant us this, may Aditi, Sindhu, the Earth, and the Sky!

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 1 = VS. XXXIII, 5; TB.
II, 7, 12, 2. Verse 2 = TB. II, 8, 7, 4. Verse 5 = TB. II, 8, 7, 4; MS.
IV, 14, 8.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:95:1:1">1</span>. The two females are evidently
Night and Dawn

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (comp. below, 96,
5). The calf is Agni whose bright appearance by night is contrasted here
with his paler splendour by day (comp. below, 127, 5). The explanation
of Professor Hillebrandt (Vedische Mythologie, I, 331) that 'das von
ihnen wechselnd gesäugte Kalb der bald als Sonne bald als Mond
erscheinende Lichtgott, d. h. Agni ist,' does not seem convincing to me.

Note <span id="an_1:95:1:2">2</span>. I cannot follow Hillebrandt (loc.
cit. 335) in translating svadhâ´vân 'an Labung reich.'

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:95:2:1">1</span>. On feminine nominatives in -âsa*h*
like átandrâsa*h*, see Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 362.

Note <span id="an_1:95:2:2">2</span>. The ten young women are the
fingers which produce the fire by the attrition of woods.

Note <span id="an_1:95:2:3">3</span>. On Tvash*tri* as the father of
Agni, see Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, I, 522 seq.; Bergaigne, Rel.
Véd., III, 47 seq.

Note <span id="an_1:95:2:4">4</span>. Hillebrandt (loc. cit.) takes the
ten fingers as the subject of pári nayanti, which does not seem
probable.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:95:3:1">1</span>. It is surprising that Agni's birth
in the sea and his birth in the waters are distinguished. The poet's
meaning is not quite clear. Prof. Max Müller thinks of the rising sun
and the lightning in the clouds. Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 107.

Note <span id="an_1:95:3:2">2</span>. We ought to read pradí*s*am; comp.
IV, 29, 3; IX. IX. 111, 3.

Note <span id="an_1:95:3:3">3</span>. Comp. X, 85, 18, where it is said
of the moon that she 'is born again, determining the seasons.' Thus it
is possible that the poet understands here Agni as dwelling in the moon
as light. Comp. on this identification Bergaigne, I, 159, and
Hillebrandt, Ved. Mythologie, I, 330 seq. But this interpretation of our
passage is by no means certain.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:95:4:1">1</span>. Possibly we should correct ká*h*
idám va*h* ni*n*yám; comp. VII, 56, 4; 61, 5. The translation would be:
'Who

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

among you has understood this secret?'—the secret that a calf should
give birth to cows.

Note <span id="an_1:95:4:2">2</span>. In my opinion the mothers are the
waters; the calf is Agni. The meaning must be, consequently, that, as
Agni is born from the waters thus the waters are born from Agni. Agni—we
may try to interpret the poet's meaning—sends his smoke to the sky. The
smoke is charged to clouds; the clouds send forth water. Exactly the
same meaning seems to be expressed in I, 164, 51. Comp. also Manu III,
76. agnau prâstâhuti*h* samyag âdityam upatish*th*ate, âdityâ*g*
*g*âyate v*ri*sh*t*ir v*ri*sh*t*er anna*m* tata*h* pra*g*â*h*.—Prof. Max
Müller observes: 'The mothers are day and night, or heaven and earth.
The calf, the son, Agni, being born of the night gives birth to the day,
and beings born of the day (in the evening) gives birth to the night. Or
it may be that Agni, light, makes Dyaus and P*ri*thivî to be
visible.'—Prof. Hillebrandt's interpretation of our verse is quite
different; see Vedische Mythologie, I, 33.5.

Note <span id="an_1:95:4:3">3</span>. I. e. the fire is born from the
waters.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:95:5:1">1</span>. Comp. Hillebrandt, Ved. Myth., I,
371, 523.

Note <span id="an_1:95:5:2">2</span>. I. e. the son of Tvash*tri* (see
above. verse 2) considered as identical with his father. Comp.
Bergaigne, III, 47, and see also Aufrecht, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, I, 356.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:95:6:1">1</span>. On dáksha and its relation to
krátu, comp. Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 267.

Note <span id="an_1:95:6:2">2</span>. The poet seems to play upon words;
'power' is dáksha, 'from the right side' dakshi*n*atá*h* (i. e.
approaching respectfully, dakshi*n*îk*ri*tya).

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:95:7:1">1</span>. Comp. Bergaigne, Rel. Véd., III,
46.

Note <span id="an_1:95:7:2">2</span>. Observe the dual form sí*k*au
ending in -au, not in -â. Comp. Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 576. Prof. Max

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Müller translates
here: He the terrible tries and stretches out the hems of his sleeves.'
This may indeed be the meaning of si*k*.

Note <span id="an_1:95:7:3">3</span>. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, II,
189.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:95:8:1">1</span>. The cows of course are intended
for the sacrificial food coming from the cow, such as milk and butter.

Note <span id="an_1:95:8:2">2</span>. The two nominatives, kaví*h* and
dhî´*h*, can scarcely be right. The subject seems to be the prayer which
cleanses, as it were, Agni, and thus augments his splendour (comp. IV,
15, 6; VIII, 103, 7). Possibly we should read kavé*h* budhnám. Comp.,
however, IX, 47, 4. svayám kaví*h* vidhartári víprâya rátnam i*kkh*ati
yádi marm*rig*yáte dhíya*h*. In this difficult verse so much is clear
that the seer (kaví*h*) is subject, and that he is stated to purify the
prayers.

Note <span id="an_1:95:8:3">3</span>. The meaning seems to be that at
the sacrificial fire all gods assemble.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:95:9:1">1</span>. On dhâ´man, comp. M. M., vol.
xxxii, p. 383 seq.—Prof. Max Müller proposes the following translation:
'Thy wide effulgence goes round the firmament, the firm seat of the
strong one (buffalo).'

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:95:10:1">1</span>. Ludwig takes sróta*h* as a
locative. But it is very improbable that we should have here a survival
of the ancient locatives of stems in -s without a case-ending (Joh.
Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 306; Brugmann, Grundriss der vergl.
Grammatik, vol. ii, p. 611). In Ludwig's opinion 'it follows from the
corresponding gâtum ûrmim that srotas stands for srotasi as dhanvan for
dhanvani.' But this is not convincing.

Note <span id="an_1:95:10:2">2</span>. On Agni as inhabiting the
sprouting grass, comp. III, 5, 8; VII, 9, 3. 'I believe this refers to
the blades of grass used as tinder to catch the sparks of fire.' M. M.
