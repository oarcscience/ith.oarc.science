### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 11.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 11.

1\. Thy auspicious face, O mighty Agni, shines in the neighbourhood of
the sun [1](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:1:1.md). Brilliant to see, it is seen even
by night. Soft to behold is the food in thy (beautiful)
body [2](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:1:2.md).

2\. O Agni, disclose (wise) thoughts for him who praises thee;
(disclose) the opening, when thou, O strong-born, hast been praised with
trembling. Grant unto us, O very great one, such a rich prayer as thou
with all the gods wilt hold dear, O brilliant one.

3\. From thee, O Agni, genius is born, from thee (wise) thoughts, from
thee beneficent hymns. From thee comes wealth adorned with
heroes [1](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:3:1.md) to the thus-minded mortal who
worships thee.

4\. From thee the racer is born that wins booty, whose energy expands
round-about [1](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:4:1.md), the helpful, of true
strength; from thee delightful wealth sent by the gods; from thee, O
Agni, the swift and impetuous horse.

5\. Thee, O Agni, the pious mortals seek to win by their prayers as the
first, thee the god with agreeable speech, O immortal, who drivest away
malice, the household god, the lord of the house, the wise one.

6\. (Drive) far from us senselessness and anguish; (drive) far all
ill-will from him whom thou attendest [1](sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:6:1.md). Be
gracious at evening, Agni, son of strength, to him whom thou, the god,
attendest with welfare.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Trish*t*ubh.—Verse 1 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 1.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_4:11:1:1">1</span>. Comp. above, IV, 10, 5. ro*k*ate
upâké.

Note <span id="an_4:11:1:2">2</span>. Literally, 'in thy appearance'
(rûpé). Thus the Soma is stated, IX, 16, 6, to purify itself rûpé
avyáye, literally, 'in the appearance of the sheep,' i. e. in the filter
made of sheep's hair.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_4:11:3:1">1</span>. See Lanman, p. 560; Pischel, Ved.
Studien, II, 115.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_4:11:4:1">1</span>. On víhâyâ*h*, see V. Henry, Les
livres VIII et IX de l’Atharva-véda (1894), p. 40 (AV. VIII, 2, 7).

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_4:11:6:1">1</span>. Probably the correct Padapâ*th*a
reading would be, as Prof. Bartholomae (Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV,
190) has noticed, yám nipâ´si (cf. Pâda d: yám … sá*k*ase). If yát is
correct, the translation will be: '(drive) far all ill-will when thou
protectest (us).'—Bartholomae proposes either to change asmát to asmât,
or to interpret it as an equivalent of asmât. It is possible, though in
my opinion not very probable, that the text should be changed. The
ablative asmát very frequently depends on âré.
