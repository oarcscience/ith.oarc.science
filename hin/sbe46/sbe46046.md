### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 148.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 17.

1\. When Mâtari*s*van … [1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:1:1) had produced by
attrition the Hot*ri*, the … [2](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:1:2) who belongs
to all gods, whom they have established among the human clans, shining
like the sun, resplendent that (he might show his beautiful) shape—

2\. They did not deceive him [1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:2:1) who had
granted a hymn (to the worshipper). Agni is my protection; therewith he
is satisfied. They took pleasure in all
his [2](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:2:2) works—(in the works) of the singer
who brought praise.

3\. Whom the worshipful (gods) [1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:3:1) took and
placed in his own seat (as priest) with their praises: him
they [2](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:3:2) have carried forward, taking hold of
him in their search, hastening like horses that draw a chariot.

4\. The marvellous one destroys many things with his jaws.
Then [1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:4:1) the resplendent one shines in the
forest. Then the wind blows after his flame day by day as after the
arrow of an archer, after a weapon that has been shot.

5\. Him whom no impostors, no harmful
foes [1](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:5:1), no harm-doers may harm when he
dwells in (his mother's) womb, him the blind ones bereft of sight did
not damage by looking at him [2](sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:5:2). His own
friends have protected him.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 1 = MS. IV, 14, 15.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:148:1:1">1</span>. The first Pâda is identical with
the first Pâda of I, 71, 4 (see our note there) with the exception of
the word vish*t*á*h*, instead of which that parallel passage has the
reading ví-bh*ri*ta*h*. It seems impossible to explain vish*t*á*h*, and
the concurrence of the metrical irregularity in the same part of the
Pâda—though metrical irregularities are not infrequent in this
hymn—invites to a correction of the text. If ví-bh*ri*ta*h* in I, 71, 4
(see note there) refers to Mâtari*s*van, which I consider as doubtful,
it would be easy to find for our passage an equivalent of that word
little differing from the traditional vish*t*á*h*, namely, vísthita*h*:
'when Mâtari*s*van, standing in different places, had produced him by
attrition.' Of course whoever adopts a conjecture like this, can
scarcely avoid understanding ví-bh*ri*ta*h* in I, 71, 4 as an epithet of
Mâtari*s*van, not of Agni. Another way to correct our passage would be
to put into the text a form derived from the root vish, 'to accomplish a
work,' for instance, vish*t*yâ´ (to be read as trisyllabic): 'when
Mâtari*s*van by his effort,' &c. Grassmann's ví-sita*h* is quite
improbable.

Note <span id="an_1:148:1:2">2</span>. Vi*s*vá-apsum (Sa*m*hitâ text,
vi*s*vâ´psum), evidently an epithet of Agni the Hot*ri*, seems corrupt.
Shall we read vi*s*vá-psum ('endowed with all food')—comp. VIII, 22, 12.
hávam vi*s*vápsum vi*s*vávâryam—or vi*s*va-púsham (Sa*m*h.,
vi*s*vâpúsham, 'all-nourishing') or vi*s*vá-apasam ('doing all works')?
Also vi*s*vá-psnyam may be thought of. It is impossible, of course, to
arrive at any certain conclusion.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:148:2:1">1</span>. 'He' seems to be Agni. Sâya*n*a,
however, explains: dadânam id agnaye kurvâ*n*am eva mâm. This would lead
to a translation like this: '(The enemies) did

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

not deceive (me, the worshipper) who had addressed a hymn (to Agni).'

Note <span id="an_1:148:2:2">2</span>. On 'his' Sâya*n*a remarks,
'ya*g*amânasya mama.' But the word may refer to Agni.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:148:3:1">1</span>. There is no reason for abandoning
here the usual meaning of ya*gñ*íya. On the gods seeking after Agni,
comp. Bergaigne, I, 110.

Note <span id="an_1:148:3:2">2</span>. It is very probable, to say the
least, that 'they' are again the gods.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:148:4:1">1</span>. Is the first â´t dissyllabic?
More probably the Pâda is deficient by one syllable.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:148:5:1">1</span>. Two syllables are wanting before
the caesura of the first Pâda.

Note <span id="an_1:148:5:2">2</span>. Was there a belief that a blind
man by turning his blind eyes on somebody could do him harm? Possibly we
might have to translate: 'Him (his foes) blind and bereft of sight did
not damage though looking at him (i. e. though turning their blind eyes
on him).'—Prof. Max Müller writes: 'Could it be: Even the blind saw, but
did not injure him (andhâ´*h* apa*s*yan ná dabhan); abhikhyâ´, when he
was seen, no longer in the womb?'
