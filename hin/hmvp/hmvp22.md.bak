##### 4. THE NRISINGHA OR MAN-LION AVATĀRA.

In the account of the preceding incarnation, it was stated that Vishnu,
ere he raised the earth on his tusk, slew a demon named Hiranyāksha.
This daitya had a

brother named Hiranyakasipu, who, the "Vāyu Purāna" says, had obtained a
boon from Brahmā, that he should not be slain by any created being; the
"Kūrma Purāna" adds, excepting Vishnu. When therefore his pride,

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

fostered by his supposed immunity from danger, had led him to great
excesses, so that his death was desired both by gods and men, Vishnu
descended in the form of a living being, half-man and half-lion, and so
neither man nor animal, and slew him. By the assumption of this form the
*letter* of Brahmā's promise was kept. The story of the demon's hatred
of the deity, because in a former incarnation he had slain his brother,
is a most interesting one. And as it teaches the wonderful efficacy of
Vishnu's worship, it is given at some length. It is taken mostly from
the "Vishnu Purāna." <span id="fr_153"></span>[\*](#fn_153.md)

"Hiranyakasipu, the son of Diti, had formerly brought the three worlds
under his authority, confiding in a boon bestowed upon him by Brahmā,.
He had usurped the sovereignty of Indra, and exercised himself the
functions of the sun, of air, of the lord of waters, of fire, and of the
moon. He himself was the god of riches; he was the judge of the dead;
and he appropriated to himself without reserve all that was offered in
sacrifice to the gods. The deities, therefore, flying from their seats
in heaven, wandered, through fear of the daitya, upon the earth,
disguised in mortal shapes. Having conquered the three worlds, he was
inflated with pride, and, eulogized by the Gandharvas, enjoyed whatever
he desired."

This demon had a son named Prahlāda, who was a very devout worshipper of
Vishnu, whom his father hated most intensely. "On one occasion Prahlāda
came, accompanied by his teacher, to the court of his father, and bowed
himself before his feet as he was drinking. Hiranyakasipu desired his
prostrate son to rise, and said to him, 'Repeat in substance and
agreeably what during the period of your studies you have acquired.'
Prahlāda said, 'I have learned to admire him who is without

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

beginning, middle, or end, increase or diminution; the imperishable lord
of the world, the universal cause of causes.' On hearing these words,
the sovereign of the daityas, his eyes red with wrath and his lips
swollen with indignation, turned to the preceptor of his son, and said,
'Vile Brāhman! what is this preposterous commendation of my foe that, in
disrespect to me, you have taught this boy to utter?' 'Phe preceptor
denies the charge, and Prahlāda himself replies, 'Vishnu is the
instructor of the whole world; what else should any one learn or teach,
save him, the supreme spirit? ' 'Blockhead!' exclaimed the king, 'who is
this Vishnu, whose name you thus reiterate so impertinently before me,
who am the sovereign of the three worlds?' 'The glory of Vishnu,'
replied Prahlāda, 'is to be meditated upon by the devout; it cannot be
described; he is the supreme lord, who is all things, and from whom all
things proceed.' The king threatens death; but the son says, 'Vishnu is
the creator and protector not of me alone, but of all human beings, and
even, father, of you.' The father can bear this no longer, so orders his
son to return to his preceptor's house.

"Prahlāda is taken away, but after a time is sent for again. When
requested to recite some poetry, he commenced to sing the praises of
Vishnu, which so exasperated the king, that he cried out, 'Kill the
wretch! He is not fit to live who is a traitor to his friends, a burning
brand to his own race.' Upon this the attendants rushed upon Prahlāda
with their weapons, and, though hundreds struck him, none could injure
him. His father then entreated him to desist from praising Vishnu; but
this the son would not do, as he said he bad no fear, as long as his
immortal guardian against all dangers was present in his mind.'

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

"Hiranyakasipu, highly exasperated, commanded the serpents to fall upon
his disobedient and insane son, and bite him to death. The serpents did
their worst, but Prahlāda felt them not. The snakes cried out to the
king, 'Our fangs are broken; our jewelled crests are burst; there is
fever in our hoods, and fear in our hearts; but the skin of the youth is
still unscathed. Have recourse, O king of the daityas? to some other
expedient.'

"The young prince" (by his father's orders) "was then assailed by the
elephants of the skies, as vast as mountain peaks; cast down upon the
earth, and trampled on and gored by their tusks; but he continued to
meditate on Govinda, and the tusks of the elephants were blunted against
his breast.

"Failing in this, the king said, 'Let fire consume him; and do thou,
deity of the winds, blow up the fire, that this wicked wretch may be
consumed.' And the dānavas piled a mighty heap of wood around the
prince, and kindled a fire to burn him, as their master had commanded.
But Prahlāda cried, 'Father, this fire, though blown by the winds,
burneth me not; and all around I behold the face of the skies, cool and
fragrant with beds of lotus flowers.'

"The Brāhmans now interceded with the king on the prince's behalf,
promising either to teach him to recant his errors, or to find some
means of accomplishing his death; but instead of profiting by their
instructions, he spends his time in speaking to all about him of the
glory of Vishnu and the happiness of his worshippers. They informed the
king of their failure to bring the prince to a right state of mind;
whereupon the cooks are ordered to mix poison with his food. But this
expedient was futile, as the others had been. The

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brāhmans now
reason with him, and try to show him that it is the chief duty of a son
to honour his father; but their sophistry is unsuccessful. They remind
him that they had promised to use incantations to accomplish his death.
This menace he meets with these words: 'What living creature slays or is
slain? What living creature preserves or is preserved? Each is his own
destroyer or preserver as he follows evil or good.' Enraged by this
reply, they now produce a magical female figure, enwreathed in a flame
of fire, whose tread parched the earth, and who struck Prahlāda upon the
breast. Her blow fell harmless upon him; but turning towards the
Brāhmans, she slew them all, and disappeared. In answer to the prince's
prayer, they were, however, restored to life, and, having blessed
Prahlāda, departed and told the king all that had happened.

"Having sent for his son, Hiranyakasipu inquired again, by what magical
art he was able thus to protect himself. Prahlāda said that it was not
by magic at all, but simply by the indwelling of Vishnu that he was able
to ward off evil; and further that the same power was within the reach
of all who would trust him. The king, enraged at this avowal, commanded
his attendants to cast his son from the summit of the palace where he
was sitting, and which was many yojans in height, upon the tops of the
mountains, where his body would be dashed to pieces against the rocks.
Accordingly the daityas hurled the boy down, but as he fell cherishing
Hari in his heart, Earth, the nurse of all creatures, received him
gently in her lap, thus entirely devoted to Kesava, the protector of the
world."

Hiranyakasipu, seeing that this fall had not injured his son in any way,
asks Samvara, the mightiest of enchanters, to try his hand; but though
he puts forth

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

all his skill, the boy remains unhurt. After this, the prince goes again
to his preceptor's house, where he is instructed in politics. When his
education in this science was completed, he is taken to the king for
examination; but on being questioned as to his mode of government, he
admits that though he has been instructed in these subjects, he does not
approve of what his teachers had said, and again sings the praises of
Vishnu. His father, "burning with rage, exclaimed, Bind him with strong
bands and cast him into the ocean. Death is the just retribution of the
disobedient.' The daityas bound the prince with strong bands, as their
lord had commanded, and threw him into the sea. As he floated on the
waters, the ocean was convulsed throughout its whole extent, and rose in
mighty indulations, threatening to submerge the earth. When
Hiranyakasipu observed this, he commanded the daityas to hurl rocks into
the sea, and pile them closely on one another, burying beneath their
incumbent mass him whom fire could not burn. . . . 'Here, since he
cannot die, let him live for thousands of years at the bottom of the
ocean, overwhelmed by mountains.' This was done. But Prahlāda was
uninjured. His mind was filled with thoughts of Hari, and he came to
recognize his real identity with Vishnu. As soon as Prahlāda, through
the force of contemplation, had become one with Vishnu, the bands with
which he was bound burst instantly asunder. Prahlāda, after hymning the
praises of Vishnu, again returns to his father, who no sooner saw him,
than he kissed him on the forehead, embraced him, and shed tears, and
said, 'Dost thou live, my son?'"

For a time there was complete reconciliation between them. And only in a
very cursory manner does the

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Vishnu Purāna"
allude to the death of Hiranyakasipu. After speaking of the
reconciliation between the father and son, without any intimation of
further dispute, it goes on to say: "After his father had been put to
death by Vishnu in the form of the man-lion, Prahlāda became the
sovereign of the daityas." In the Bhāgavat we are told that Prahlāda had
said that Vishnu was in him, in his father; in fact, was everywhere.
"Hiranyakasipu says, 'Why, if Vishnu is everywhere, is he not visible in
this pillar?' Being told that Vishnu, though unseen, was really present
there, he struck the pillar, saying, Then I will kill him.' Immediately
Vishnu, in the form of a being half-man and half-lion, came forth from
the pillar, laid hold of Hiranyakasipu by the thighs with his teeth, and
tore him up the middle. Brahmā's boon to this daitya king, as a reward
of his religious observances, was that no common animal should destroy
him, that he should die neither in the day nor night, in earth or in
heaven, by fire, by water, or by the sword. This promise was kept in the
letter, for it was evening when Vishnu slew him; this is neither day nor
night. It was done under the droppings of the thatch, and this,
according to a Hindu proverb, is out of the earth, and he was not killed
by a man or an ordinary animal." <span
