### CHAPTER IX.

#### SACRED TREES.

<span class="smallcaps">Several</span> trees are regarded as sacred;
they being representative of, or peculiarly dear to, some of the
deities. It is a meritorious act to plant and water them, and such is
the respect cherished for them, that even their withered branches are
not allowed to be burnt. The

same ceremonies are observed at the planting of these trees, or, when
they have been taken care of for some time, at their consecration, as
are observed at the setting up of an image. The following are the names
of the sacred trees:—

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

The Asvatta, or Pipul. Tree (*Ficus religiosa*), sacred to Vishnu.

The Vata, Banyan or Indian Fig Tree <span
id="fr_440"></span>[\*](#fn_440) (*Ficus Indica*.md), also sacred to
Vishnu.

The Vilva, or Wood-apple, or Bēl Tree (*Ægle Marmelos*), sacred to Siva.

The Vakula (*Mimusops Elengi*).

The Harltāki (*Terminalia chebula*).

The Amalaki, or *Emblic Myrobalans* (*Phyllanthus emblica*).

The Nimba, or Nim Tree (*Melia azadirachta*).

The Tulsi (*Ocimum gratissimum* or *sanctum*).

The Tulsi is very commonly worshipped by the followers of Vishnu; and
the plant is most carefully tended

as his representative. Every morning the ground near it is cleaned with
cow-dung and water; at night a lamp is hung before it. During the two
hottest months of the year, a vessel of water is hung over it so that it
constantly receives moisture. When a plant dies, it is cast into a
river, the same honour being given to it as to an image as soon as the
worship of it is concluded. It is a common custom to place a sprig of
Tulsi near the head of a dying person. The origin of the worship of this
plant is said to be the following: A woman named Tulsi engaged in
religious austerities for a long period, and asked, as a boon, that she
might become the wife of Vishnu. Lakshmi, hearing of this, cursed her,
and changed her into the plant which bears her name. Vishnu, however,
comforted his follower with the assurance that he would assume the form
of the Shālgrāma, and continue near her. <span
id="fr_441"></span>[\*](#fn_441.md) The Vāyu and the Padma Purānas teach
that the Tulsi was one of the products of the churning of the ocean.

In addition to these trees should be mentioned the *Durva* grass
(*Agrostis linearis*) and *Kusa* grass (*Poa cynosuroïdes*), which form
part of the offerings made to the gods; as do the leaves or flowers of
most of the trees previously mentioned. The Mahābhārata has a legend
accounting for the sacredness of the Kusa grass. When Garuda brought
some of the amrita from the moon for the Nāgas, or serpent deities, as
the price to be paid for his mother's release from servitude, Indra
tried to induce him not to give it to them lest they, becoming immortal,
should oust him from his throne. Garuda would not consent to this
arrangement, but told Indra that after it was given to them he could
steal it.

<span id="page_472">p. 472</span>

Garuda therefore placed the amrita in a vessel on the grass, and whilst
the Nāgas were bathing, Indra stole it. They, thinking that the ambrosia
must be on the Kusa grass, licked it; the sharp spikes slit their
tongues, and hence the serpents' tongues are forked; and the grass,
having been touched by the amrita, is holy.
