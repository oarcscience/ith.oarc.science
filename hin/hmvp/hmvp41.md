### CHAPTER IV.

#### THE DEMIGODS OF THE MAHĀBHĀRATA.

<span class="smallcaps">As</span> these heroes are so intimately
connected with each other, a separate account of each would necessitate
frequent repetition; they will therefore be noticed together, in a brief
outline of the main story of the Mahābhārata. <span
id="fr_389"></span>[\*](#fn_389.md)

In the fifth generation from Soma (the Moon), the progenitor of the
Lunar race, who reigned at Hastināpur, came two sons, Puru <span
id="fr_390"></span>[†](#fn_390.md) and Yadu; from whom proceeded two
branches of the Lunar line. In the account of Krishna and Balarāma, who
were born in the Yadu tribe, we have seen the end of that branch of the
family. Sixteenth from Puru, the founder of the other

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

branch, came Bharata, from whom India takes its name, Bharatvarsha (the
country of Bharata), in the present day. Twenty-third from Bharata came
Sāntanu. This Sāntanu had two sons, Bhishma, by the goddess Gangā (the
Ganges), and Vichitravīrya, by Satyavati. <span
id="fr_391"></span>[\*](#fn_391.md) Satyavati had a son named Vyāsa before
her marriage with Sāntanu; so that Bhishma, Vichitravīrya, and Vyāsa
were half-brothers. Bhishma became a Brahmācharī (*i.e.* took a vow of
celibacy). Vyāsa retired to the wilderness to live a life of
contemplation, but promised his mother that he would obey her in
everything.

Now it so happened that Vichitravīrya died childless, and Satyavati was
therefore obliged to ask her son Vyāsa to marry the childless widows.
The result was that the one wife, Ambikā, had a son who was born blind,
named Dhritarāshtra. This blindness is said to have been caused by the
fact that Vyāsa, coming in from his ascetic life, was so repulsive in
appearance that Ambikā kept her eyes closed all the time he remained
with her. The other wife, named Ambālika, had a son who was born of a
pale complexion, and named Pāndu; this paleness was the result of the
fear that Vyāsa caused to the mother. Satyavati, not satisfied with
either of these children, wished for another and perfect child. But
Ambikā, dressing up one of her slaves, sent her to Vyāsa in her stead;
the result was that this girl had a son who was called Vidura. After
fulfilling his

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

mother's commands, Vyāsa returned to his ascetic life in the forest.

Bhishma, the uncle of these children, conducted the government of
Hastināpur in their name during their minority, and their education was
also entrusted to him. Dhritarāshtra, though blind, is described as
excelling the others in strength; Pāndu, as being skilled in the use of
the bow; and Vidura, as pre-eminent in virtue and wisdom.

When the boys came of age, Dhritarāshtra was disqualified for the throne
by reason of his blindness; Vidura could not be king because his mother
was a Sudra; Pāndu was therefore installed as king. Dhritarāshtra
married Gāndhāri (also called Saubaleyi, or Saubali), daughter of
Subala, King of Gāndhāra. Pāndu married Prithā (or Kunti), the adopted
daughter of Kuntibhoja. This Prithā, "one day, before her marriage, paid
such respect and attention to a powerful sage named Durvāsas, a guest in
her father's house, that he gave her a charm, and taught her an
incantation, by virtue of which she might have a child by any god she
liked to call into her presence. Out of curiosity, she invoked the Sun,
by whom she had a son who was born clothed in armour. But Prithā,
fearing the censure of her relatives, deserted her offspring, after
exposing it in the river. It was found by Adhirata, a charioteer, and
nurtured by his wife Rādhā; whence the child was afterwards called
Rādheya, though named by his foster-parents Vasushena. When he was grown
up, the god Indra conferred upon him enormous strength, and changed his
name to Karna." He is also called Vaikartana, being the son of Vikartana
(the Sun).

Pāndu, at his uncle Bhishma's request, next marries Mādrī, sister of
Salya, King of Madra. Soon after this

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

marriage, Pāndu undertook a great campaign, and extended his kingdom to
the dimensions it had reached in the time of his great ancestor Bharata.
He then, with his two wives, retired to the woods, that he might indulge
in his passion for hunting. The blind Dhritarāshtra, with Bhishma as
regent, ruled in his stead.

Dhritarāshtra had a hundred sons. The story of their birth is as
follows: "One day, the sage Vyāsa was hospitably entertained by Queen
Gāndhāri, and in return granted her a boon. She chose to be the mother
of a hundred sons. After two years she produced a mass of flesh, which
was divided by Vyāsa into a hundred and one pieces, as big as the joint
of a thumb. From these, in due time, the eldest, Duryodhana, was born.
The miraculous birth of the remaining ninety-nine occurred in due
course. There was also one daughter, named Duhsala." These sons of
Dhritarāshtra are generally called "The Kurus," or Kauravas.

Pāndu's children were of divine origin. This circumstance happened in
the following manner: Pāndu, as noticed above, was addicted to hunting.
One day, he "transfixed with five arrows a male and female deer. These
turned out to be a certain sage and his wife, who had assumed the form
of these animals. The sage cursed Pāndu, and predicted that he would die
in the embraces of one of his wives. In consequence of this curse, Pāndu
took the vow of a Brahmācharī, gave all his property to the Brāhmans,
and became a hermit."

Upon this, Prithā, his wife, with his approval, employed the charm and
incantation given to her by Durvāsas, and had three children: by the god
Dharma, Yudhishthira; by Vāyu, Bhīma; and by Indra, Arjuna. Mādrī, the
other wife of Pāndu, was now anxious to have children, and, acting on
the advice of Prithā, she

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

thought of the Asvins, who appeared to her according to her wish,
through whom she became the mother of twin sons, Nakula and Sahadeva.
Soon after this, Pāndu, forgetting the curse of the sage, died in the
embraces of his wife Mādrī, who was burned with the dead body of her
husband.

Prithā and the five children, generally known as the Pāndus, or
Pāndavas, now returned to Hastināpur, and informed Dhritarāshtra of the
death of his brother; he seemed to be deeply moved by the event, and the
Pāndus were allowed to live with his own sons, the Kurus.

But even when the cousins were children, enmity arose, and on one
occasion the jealousy of Duryodhana was excited to such a pitch that he
tried to poison Bhīma, and, when under its effect, threw him into the
water. "Bhīma, however, was not drowned, but descended to the abode of
the Nāgas (or serpent demons), who freed him from the poison, and gave
him a liquid to drink which endued him with strength of ten thousand
Nāgas. From that moment he became a second Hercules." Several schemes
were formed for the destruction of the Pāndus, but without success.

"The characters of the five Pāndavas are drawn with much artistic
delicacy of touch, and maintained with general consistency throughout
the poem. The eldest, Yudhishthira (the son of Dharma, virtue), is the
Hindu ideal of excellence—a pattern of justice; calm, passionless
composure; chivalrous honour and cold heroism." As the name implies
(firm in battle), "he was probably of commanding stature and imposing
presence. He is described as having a majestic, lion-like gait, with a
Wellington-like profile and long lotus-eyes.

"Bhīma (the son of Vāyu) is a type of brute courage and strength; he is
of gigantic stature, impetuous,

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

irascible, somewhat vindictive, and cruel even to the verge of ferocity,
making him, as his name implies, 'terrible.' It would appear that his
great strength had to be maintained by plentiful supplies of food, as
his name Vrikodara, 'wolf-stomached,' indicates a voracious appetite;
and we are told that at the daily meals of the five brothers, half of
the whole dish had to be given to Bhīma. But he has the capacity for
warm, unselfish love, and is ardent in his affection for his mother and
brothers.

"Arjuna (the son of Indra) rises more to the European standard of
perfection. He may be regarded as the real hero of the Mahābhārata, of
undaunted bravery, generous, with refined and delicate sensibilities,
tender-hearted, forgiving, and affectionate as a woman, yet of
superhuman strength, and matchless in arms and athletic exercises.
Nakula and Sahadeva (sons of the Asvins) are both amiable,
noble-hearted, and spirited. All five are as unlike as possible to the
hundred sons of Dhritarāshtra, who are represented as mean, spiteful,
dishonourable, and vicious." Karna (the son of the Sun), though
half-brother of these five Pāndus, in the great conflict is a valuable
ally of the Kurus; though in character he is entirely their opposite.
"He exhibited in a high degree fortitude, chivalrous honour,
self-sacrifice, and devotion. Especially remarkable for a liberal and
generous disposition, he never stooped to ignoble practices, like his
friends, the Kurus, who were emphatically bad men."

The cousins were educated together at Hastināpur by a Brāhman named
Drona; all were instructed in arms, but Arjuna, "by the help of Drona,
who gave him magical weapons, excelled all." Both Bhīma and the Kuru
Duryodhana learnt the use of the club from their

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

cousin Balarāma; Prithā, Bhīma's mother, was a sister of Vasudeva, and
therefore aunt of Krishna. When their education was completed, a
tournament was held, in which the youths displayed their skill in
archery; in the management of chariots, horses, and elephants; in sword,
spear, and club exercises, and in wrestling. "Arjuna, after exhibiting
prodigies of strength, shot five arrows simultaneously into the jaws of
a revolving iron boar, and twenty-one arrows into the hollow of a cow's
horn, suspended by a string." When he had accomplished this feat, Karma
came and did precisely the same deeds of skill, and challenged Arjuna to
single combat; but as he could not tell his parentage, he was not
considered worthy to enter the lists with the royal youth.

After the tournament was over, Yudhishthira was installed as heir
apparent, and soon made his name even more famous than his father's had
been. The people wished Yudhishthira to be crowned king at once, but the
Kurus tried hard to prevent it. First of all, the Pāndus and their
mother were sent to a house at Vāranāvata, in which a quantity of
combustible materials was placed, with the intention of burning the
whole family. The Pāndus were informed of this by Vidura, and escaped;
but the man who conducted them, and a woman with her five sons, whom
Bhīma led there in a state of intoxication, were consumed instead. By
this device, the Kurus were under the impression that their plan had
been successful. The brothers, with their mother, now hastened to the
woods, where Bhīma slew a giant named Hidimba, and then married his
sister.

By the advice of Vyāsa they now went to live in the city of Ekachakrā,
disguised as mendicant Brāhmans. Near this city was a Rākshas named
Vaka, who

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

compelled the citizens to send him a dish of food daily, and the
messenger who took it was devoured as the daintiest morsel of the whole.
One day it happened that the turn came to a Brāhman to supply the
Rākshas with a meal. The man determined to go himself, but his wife and
daughter each asked to be allowed to go with him. Lastly, the little
son, too young to speak distinctly, in prattling accents said, "Weep
not, father; sigh not, mother." Then, breaking off and brandishing a
pointed spike of grass, he exclaimed, "With this spike will I slay the
fierce, man-eating giant." Bhīma, overhearing this, offered to go; he
went, and killed the giant.

After this occurrence, Vyāsa appeared to his grandsons, and informed
them that Draupadi, the daughter of Drupada, King of Panchāla, was
destined to be their common wife. This girl, in a former birth, was the
daughter of a sage, and had performed a most severe penance in order
that she might have a husband. Siva, pleased with her devotion, said,
"You shall have five husbands; for five times you said, 'Give me a
husband.'" When the brothers returned from Draupadi's Svayambara (a
tournament in which the princess chose for herself a husband), Arjuna
having been selected from amongst many suitors on account of his skill
in archery, their mother, hearing their footsteps, and, fancying they
were bringing alms, said, "Divide it amongst yourselves." The word of a
mother could not be set aside, so Vyāsa showed them that it was
appointed that Draupadi should be the wife of each. At this tournament
Arjuna displayed great skill in the use of the bow, by piercing a fish
that was suspended in the air, without looking directly at the object;
he saw its image only, reflected in a pan of water on the ground.

Vyāsa, seeing the discrepancy between the conduct of

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

<span id="img_41900"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![ARJUNA SHOOTING AT

ARJUNA SHOOTING AT THE FISH  
</span>

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

the five brothers having a wife in common and that which prevailed in
his day, explains it by the fact that Arjuna was really a portion of the
essence of Indra, and his brothers portions of the same god, whilst
Draupadi herself was a form of Lakshmi; as, therefore, the five brethren
were parts of Indra, there was no impropriety in their having but one
wife. It is a fact to be noticed, that to this day polyandry prevails
amongst some of the hill-tribes of India. Draupadi is said to have had a
son by each of the brothers, and the brothers had other wives besides
Draupadi. It was noticed above that Bhīma married Hidimbā. Arjuna
married Krishna's sister, Subhadrā, and also a serpent-nymph named
Uludi, and Chitrāngadā, daughter of the King of Manipura.

When the Pāndus, by their marriage with Draupadi, had allied themselves
with the King of Panchāla, they threw off their disguise, and their
uncle Dhritarāshtra divided the kingdom: to his sons he gave Hastināpur;
to the Pāndus a district near the Yamuna (Jumna), called
Khāndavaprastha. Here they built Indraprastha (Delhi), and, under
Yudhishthira, their kingdom grew.

Arjuna wandered in the forest alone for twelve years, in fulfilment of a
vow, and there met Krishna, who invited him to Dwāraka, where he married
Subhadrā. Krishna was invited to a great festival in honour of the
inauguration of Yudhishthira as sovereign. Acting on Nārada's advice,
Bhishma proposed that an oblation should be made to the best and
strongest person present, and selected Krishna. Sisupāla objected, and,
as he openly reviled Krishna, the deity struck off his head with his
discus.

After this, a festival was held at Hastināpur, to which the Pāndus were
invited. Yudhishthira was induced to

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

play; and having staked his kingdom, his possessions, and, last of all,
Draupadi, he lost everything. A compromise was effected. Duryodhana was
made ruler over the whole kingdom for twelve years; whilst the Pāndus
with Draupadi were to live in the forest for the same period, and to
pass the thirteenth year under assumed names, in various disguises.
Whilst enjoying this forest life, Arjuna went to the Himalayas to
perform severe penance in order to obtain celestial arms. "After some
time, Siva, to reward him and prove his bravery, approached as a
Kirātā, <span id="fr_392"></span>[\*](#fn_392.md) or wild mountaineer, at
the moment that a demon named Mūka, in the form of a boar, attacked him.
Siva and Arjuna shot together at the boar, which fell dead, and both
claimed to have hit him first. This served as a pretext for Siva to have
a battle with him. Arjuna fought long with the Kirātā but could not
conquer him. At last he recognized the god, and threw himself at his
feet, when Siva, pleased with his bravery, gave him the celebrated
weapon Pāsupata, to enable him to conquer Karna and the Kuru princes in
war."

In the thirteenth year of exile the Pāndus journeyed to the court of
King Virāta, and entered his service in disguise. Yudhishthira called
himself a Brāhman, and took the name of Kanka. Arjuna called himself
Vrihanalā, and, pretending to be a eunuch, adopted a sort of woman's
dress, and taught music and dancing. One day when Virāta and four of the
Pāndus were absent, Duryodhana and his brother attacked Virāta's
capital, and carried off some cattle. Uttara, the king's son, followed
them, having Arjuna as his charioteer. When

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

they came in sight of the enemy, Uttara's heart failed him. Arjuna
changed places with him, having told him who he was. This gave him
courage, the Kuru army was defeated, and the stolen cattle reclaimed.
Arjuna asked Uttara to keep the secret of his real character for the
present. A short time afterwards, at a great assembly called by Virāta,
the Pāndus took their places amongst the princes, and were welcomed
heartily by the king.

A council of princes was soon held, at which Krishna and Balarāma were
present, to consider how the Pāndus could regain their possessions. Some
were for immediate war; Krishna and Balarāma urged that attempts at
negotiation should first be made. This advice was acted upon, but
without result. In the mean time, Krishna and his brother returned to
Dwāraka. Not long after his arrival at his capital, Duryodhana, the Kuru
prince, visited Krishna to ask his aid in the coming struggle; and on
the same day, Arjuna, the Pāndu prince, arrived there for the same
purpose. And " it happened that they both reached the door of Krishna's
apartment, where he was asleep, at the same moment. Duryodhana succeeded
in entering first, and took up his station at Krishna's head; Arjuna
followed, and stood reverently at his feet." Krishna, on awaking, first
saw Arjuna; and when the cousins mentioned the object of their visit, he
gave the right of choice to Arjuna. He offered himself to one side, but
said he should not himself fight; and to the other side his army of a
hundred million warriors. Arjuna at once chose Krishna, and Duryodhana
was delighted with the prospect of having Krishna's immense army on his
side. Duryodhana then asked Balarāma's aid, but was informed that both
the brothers had decided to take no active part in the

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

<span id="img_42300"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![BATTLE OF THE

BATTLE OF THE KURUS AND PĀNDAVAS  
</span>

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

conflict. Krishna, however, consented to act as Arjuna's charioteer, and
joined the Pāndus at Virāta's capital.

Fresh negotiations were commenced, and Krishna himself went as mediator
to the Kurus; but although in the assembly he assumed his divine form,
and "Brahmā appeared in his forehead, Rudra on his breast, the guardians
of the world issued from his arms, and Agni from his mouth"—although the
other gods were visible in and about his person—his attempt at
reconciliation failed. War was determined on between the cousins.
Bhishma was made the commander-in-chief of the Kuru army; and
Dhrishtadyumna, son of Drupada, was the leader of the Pāndus. Vyāsa
offered to give sight to Dhritarāshtra, to enable him to witness the
conflict, but, as the blind man declined the offer, he gave to his
charioteer, Sanjaya, the faculty of knowing everything that took place,
made him invulnerable, and bestowed on him the power to transport
himself by a thought to any part of the field of battle.

The armies met on Kurukshetra, a plain to the north-west of the modern
Delhi, and we are told that "monstrous elephants career over the field,
trampling on men and horses, and dealing destruction with their huge
tusks; enormous clubs and iron maces clash together with the noise of
thunder; rattling chariots dash against each other; thousands of arrows
hurtle in the air, darkening the sky; trumpets, kettledrums, and horns
add to the uproar; confusion, carnage, and death are everywhere."

The Pāndus are described as performing prodigies of might. Arjuna killed
five hundred warriors simultaneously, covered the plain with dead, and
filled rivers with blood: Yudhishthira "slaughtered a hundred men" in a
mere twinkle: Bhīma annihilated a monstrous

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

elephant, including all mounted upon it, and fourteen foot soldiers
besides, with one blow of his club: Nakula and Sahadeva, when fighting
from their chariots, cut off heads by the thousand, and sowed them like
seed upon the ground. Of the weapons employed, about a hundred are
named; and the conch shell which served as the trumpet of each leader
had its distinct name, as had also the weapons of each of the chiefs.

The first great single combat was between Bhishma and Arjuna, which
resulted in Bhishma being so transfixed with arrows that "there was not
a space of two fingers’ breadth on his whole body unpierced. Falling
from his chariot, his body could not touch the ground, as it was
surrounded by countless arrows, and thus it reclined on its arrowy
couch. He had received from his father the power of fixing the time of
his own death, and now declared that lie intended retaining life till
the sun entered the summer solstice. The warriors on both sides ceased
fighting that they might view the wonderful sight and do homage to their
dying relative. As he lay on his uncomfortable bed, with his head
hanging down, he begged for a pillow, whereupon the chiefs brought him
soft supports; these the hardy old soldier sternly rejected. Arjuna then
made a rest for him with three arrows, which Bhishma quite approved; and
soon afterwards asked him to bring a little water. Arjuna struck the
ground with an arrow, and forthwith a pure spring burst forth, which so
refreshed Bhishma that he called for Duryodhana, and begged him, before
it was too late, to restore half the kingdom to the Pāndavas."

Drona, the tutor of the princes, is appointed to take the command of the
Kuru army after the fall of Bhishma; and a number of single combats are
described. Bhīma's

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

son by the Rākshasi Hidimbā is slain by Karna; Drupada's son,
Dhrishtadyumna, the leader of the Pāndus, overcomes Drona; Drona being a
Brāhman, when overpowered by his foe, voluntarily laid down his life,
and is conducted to heaven "in a glittering shape like the sun," to save
Dhrishtadyumna from the enormous crime of killing a Brāhman. Karna was
then made leader of the Kurus in place of Drona. Bhīma next slew
Duhsāsana, and remembering how this prince had insulted Draupadi, he
drank the blood of his fallen foe. Arjuna then slew Karna, and Salya,
King of Madra, was appointed to fill the vacant post. Bhīma challenges
Salya, and the following is the account of their encounter:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Soon as he saw his charioteer struck down,  
 Straightway the Madra monarch grasped his mace,  
 And like a mountain, firm and motionless,  
 Awaited the attack. The warrior's form  
 Was awful as the world-consuming fire,  
 Or as the noose-armed god of death, or as  
 The peaked Kailāsa, or the Thunderer  
 Himself, or as the trident-bearing god,  
 Or as a maddened forest elephant.  
 Him to defy did Bhīma hastily  
 Advance, wielding aloft his massive club.  
 A thousand conchs and trumpets, and a shout,  
 Firing each champion's ardour, rent the air.  
 From either host, spectators of the fight,  
 Burst forth applauding cheers: 'The Madra king  
 Alone,' they cried, 'can bear the rush of Bhīma;'  
 'None but heroic Bhīma can sustain  
 The force of Salya.' Now like two fierce bulls  
 Sprang they towards each other, mace in hand.  
 And first, as cautiously they circled round,  
 Whirling their weapons as in sport, the pair  
 Seemed matched in equal combat. Salya's club,  
 Set with red fillets, glittered as with flame,  
 While that of Bhīma gleamed like flashing lightning.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small"><span class="contnote">\[paragraph
continues\]</span>  Anon the clashing irons met, and scattered round  
 A fiery shower; then, fierce as elephants  
 Or butting bulls, they battered each the other.  
 Thick fell the blows, and soon each stalwart frame,  
 Spattered with gore, glowed like the Kinsuka,  
 Bedecked with scarlet blossoms; yet beneath  
 The rain of strokes, unshaken as a rock,  
 Bhīma sustained the mace of Salya, he  
 With equal firmness bore the other's blows.  
 Now, like the roar of crashing thunder-clouds,  
 Sounded the clashing iron; then, their clubs  
 Brandished aloft, eight paces they retired,  
 And swift again advancing to the fight,  
 Met in the midst like two huge mountain crags  
 Hurled into contact. Nor could either bear  
 The other's shock; together down they rolled,  
 Mangled and crushed, like two tall standards fallen."</span>

</div>

Yudhishthira then fought with and eventually slew Salya. After suffering
continual reverses, the Kurus rallied for a final charge, which led to
so great a slaughter, that only four of their leaders, Duryodhana,
Asvatthāman (son of Drona), Kritavarman, and Kripa remained, whilst
"nothing remained of eleven whole armies." Whereupon Duryodhana resolved
upon flight, and taking refuge in a lake, by his magical power supported
it so as to form a chamber round his body. The Pāndus discovered his
retreat; but when taunted by them, he told them to take the kingdom, as,
his brothers having all been slain, he had no pleasure in life. At last,
enraged by the sarcasms of his cousins, he came forth and fought with
Bhīma, from whom he received his death-wound. The remaining three Kuru
chiefs left their wounded companion and took refuge in a forest.

Whilst resting under a tree at night, Asvatthāman, seeing an owl
approach stealthily and kill numbers of sleeping crows, the thought
occurred to him that in this manner he might destroy the Pāndu forces.
Accordingly

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

he quietly entered their camp, leaving Kripa and Kritavarman to watch
the gates. Under cover of darkness they slew the whole army: the Pāndu
princes and Krishna, happening to be stationed outside the camp, alone
escaped. These three then return to Duryodhana, and tell him what they
had done. Hearing their narrative, his spirit revived for a moment; he
thanked them, bade them farewell, and expired.

The funeral obsequies of the chief are performed, and Yudhishthira is
installed as King of Hastināpur. But he is most unhappy as he thinks of
the great slaughter that has taken place. Acting on Krishna's advice, he
and his brothers visit Bhishma, who is still lingering on his " spiky
bed." For fifty-eight nights he had lain there, and ere his departure
gave utterance to a series of most lengthy didactic discourses, after
which his spirit ascended to the skies.

As Yudhishthira was entering the capital in triumph, an incident
occurred to lessen his joy in victory. A Rākshas named Chārvāka,
disguised as a Brāhman, met him and reproached him for the slaughter he
had caused; but the Brāhmans, discovering the imposture, consumed the
Rākshas to ashes with fire from their eyes. Yet even now the spirit of
the king is not at rest. After a little time, he resigns his kingdom,
and, together with his brothers and Draupadi, starts on his journey
towards Indra's heaven on Mount Meru,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When the four brothers knew the high resolve of
King Yudhishthira  
 Forthwith with Draupadi they issued forth, and after them a dog  
 Followed; the king himself went out the seventh from the royal city,  
 And all the citizens and women of the palace walked behind;  
 But none could find it in their heart to say unto the king,  
 Return.' And so at length the train of citizens went back, bidding

These went, "bent on abandonment of worldly things;

their hearts yearning for union with the Infinite." In their journey
they reach the sea, and there Arjuna cast away his bow and quiver. At
last they came in sight of Mount Meru, and Draupadi "lost hold of her
high hope, and faltering fell upon the earth." One by one the others
fall, until only Yudhishthira, Bhīma, and the dog are left. Bhīma cannot
understand why such pure beings should die: his brother informs him that
Draupadi's fall was the result of her excessive affection for Arjuna;
that Sahadeva's death was the result of pride in his own knowledge; that
Nakula's personal vanity was his ruin, and that Arjuna's fault was a
boastful confidence in his power to destroy his foes. Bhīma now falls,
and is told that the reason of his death is his selfishness, pride, and
too great love of enjoyment. Yudhishthira, left alone with the dog, is
walking on:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"When, with a sudden sound that rang through earth
and heaven, the mighty god  
 Came towards him in a chariot, and he cried, Ascend, O resolute
prince.'  
 Then did the king look back upon his fallen brothers, and addressed  
 These words unto the Thousand-eyed in anguish; 'Let my brothers here  
 Come with me. Without them, O god of gods, I could not wish to enter  
 E'en heaven! and yonder tender princess Draupadi, the faithful wife,  
 Worthy of endless bliss, let her come too. In mercy hear my
prayer.'"</span>

</div>

Indra informs him that the spirits of Draupadi and his brothers are
already in heaven, but that he alone is permitted to enter in bodily
form. The king asks that the dog may accompany him. But as this is
refused, he declines to go alone. Indra says, "You have abandoned your
brothers; why not forsake the dog?" Yudhishthira replies, "I had no
power to bring them back to

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

life: how can there be abandonment of those who no longer live?" It now
appears that the dog was no other than his father Dharma in disguise;
who, assuming his proper form, enters with him.

On reaching heaven, though Duryodhana and his cousins are already in
bliss, as he does not see Arjuna and the rest, Yudhishthira declines to
remain there without them. An angel accompanies him to hell, where he
hears their voices calling upon him for help. He therefore bids the
angel depart, as he prefers to suffer in hell with his brethren rather
than to remain in heaven without them. As soon as his resolution is
taken, the scene suddenly changes, and it appears that this was simply a
trial of his faith. He bathes in the heavenly Ganges, and in heaven,
with " Draupadi and his brothers, finds the rest and happiness that were
unattainable on earth."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_389"></span>[411:\*](hmvp41.htm#fr_389.md) This account of the
Mahābhārata is taken in an abbreviated form almost entirely from Lecture
XIII. of Monier Williams's "Indian Wisdom."

<span id="fn_390"></span>[411:†](hmvp41.htm#fr_390.md) An interesting story
is told of Puru. His father, Yayāti, married Devayāni, daughter of
Sukra, the preceptor of the Daityas. Her husband loving her servant
Sarmisthā also, Puru was born as their youngest son. The wife being
highly indignant at the unfaithfulness of her husband, returning to her
father's home, so excited the old priest that he cursed Yayāti with old
age; but afterwards consented to withdraw the curse provided one of his
sons would bear it for him. They all refused to do this excepting Puru.
As a reward for his piety, his father disinherited his other sons, and
made Puru sole heir to his dominions.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[412:\*](hmvp41.htm#fr_391.md) Satyavati was the
daughter of an Apsaras named Adrikā, who was condemned to live on earth
in the form of a fish. Parasāra, a sage, met her daughter as he was
crossing the river Yamunā, and Vyāsa was the result. He was born on an
island of the river, and hence he had the name Dwaipāyana (who moves on
an island). Vyāsa is said to have been the arranger of the Vedas, the
compiler of the Mahābhārata and the Purānas, and the founder of the
Vedanta system of philosophy.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[421:\*](hmvp41.htm#fr_392.md) The Kirātās were
mountaineers, or foresters. In the Rāmāyana they are described as
"islanders, who eat raw flesh, live in the waters, and are men-tigers."
