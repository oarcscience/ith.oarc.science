### CHAPTER VI.

#### THE ASURAS.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the Purānas and other of the later
writings of the Hindus, and also in the popular mind, the asuras are
powerful evil beings; in translations the word is represented by such
terms as demons, giants, etc. As the suras <span
id="fr_401"></span>[\*](#fn_401.md) were the gods, the asuras were
not-gods, and therefore the enemies or opponents of the gods. In the
Vedas the name asura is applied more frequently to the gods themselves
than to their enemies, whilst it is also used very much in the same
manner as in the later writings. In the Rig-Veda, Varuna is accosted as
follows: "King Varuna has made a highway for the sun to go over. O thou
wise asura and king, loosen our sins!" Again: "The all-knowing asura
established the heavens, and fixed the limits of the earth. He sat as
the supreme ruler of all worlds. These are the works of Varuna." "Asura
stands for the Supreme Spirit," in another verse, and "also as an
appellative for Prajāpati or creation's lord." <span
id="fr_402"></span>[†](#fn_402.md) Again and again Varuna alone, and also
in conjunction with Mitra, is called

<span id="page_438">p. 438</span>

an asura. "All the Vedic gods have shared the same title, not excepting
even goddesses." "Varuna was the all-knowing asura, Prajāpati the
Supreme Being; Indra, the Maruts, Tvastri, Mitra, Rudra, Agni, Vāyu,
Pushan, Savitri, Parjanya, the sacrificial priests, were all asuras. In
fine, Deva (god) and asura were synonymous expressions in a multitude of
texts." <span id="fr_403"></span>[\*](#fn_403.md)

On the other hand, in the Rig-Veda, Indra is the destroyer of asuras.
"The same Veda which speaks of the asuras as celestial beings supplies
its readers also with the Mantras, by means of which devas overcame
asuras. The texts which are condemnatory of the suras as impure and
ungodly are far less in number than those which recognize the term as
applicable to gods and priests." Dr. Banerjea, in the most interesting
and ingenious article from which the above extracts are made, suggests a
means of reconciling these contradictory uses of the word "asura."
Before the Indo-Aryans arrived in India, they had lived in close
proximity to the Persians, the original worshippers of fire. "What could
be more natural," he asks, "than that the Asura-Pracheta, or
Asura-Viswaveda of the one branch, was but the translation of the
Ahura-Mazda (the Wise Lord, according to the 'Zend-Avesta') of the other
branch; and that the word 'Ahura,' which the one used in a divine sense,
would become a household word in the other branch, in the same sense?"
the word "Ahura" being changed into "Asura," in a way common to many
other words. He then goes on to say, that as "Assur" was the term used
in Assyria for the Supreme Lord, and the Assyrians were for some time
the rulers of the Persians, it was natural that this word should find
its way into Persia; the only change being this, that the Persians added

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

Mazda (wise or good) to the term "Assur," and the Indo-Aryans received
it from them. So much for the good use of the term "Asura."

But the word "Assur" was not only used for the Supreme Lord, it also
represented the Assyrian nation, his worshippers, who were most cruel in
their treatment of their foes; and as, later on, the bitterest hatred is
known to have existed between the Indo-Aryans and the Persians, the
followers of Ahura-Mazda, Dr. Banerjea concludes that owing to the
cruelties perpetrated by the Assyrians on the one hand, and the hatred
cherished towards them by the Persians on the other, the branch of the
Aryan family that migrated into India brought with them very bitter
feelings towards Assur (the Assyrian people) and Ahuri (the belongings
of Ahura); and thus the term "Asura," which at one time was considered a
becoming epithet for the Supreme Being, became descriptive only of those
who were the enemies of the gods. In order to afford sanction for this
altered sense of a word, a new derivation has been given to it. The word
was originally derived from the root *as*, through *asu*, "breath," and
means a spirit, or "the Great Spirit." Now, however, it is explained to
be simply a compound of *a* privative, and *sura*, "god," meaning a
non-god: therefore a demon.

Whatever be the cause of it, there is no doubt that at the present day,
and throughout the later writings of the Hindus, the term "asura" is
used only for the enemies of the gods. In the "Taittirya Sanhita" <span
id="fr_404"></span>[\*](#fn_404.md) we read "that the gods and asuras
contended together, and that the former, being less numerous than the
latter, took some bricks, and placing them in a proper position to
receive the sacrificial fire, with the formula, Thou

<span id="page_440">p. 440</span>

art a multiplier,' they became numerous." In the "Satapatha
Brāhmana" <span id="fr_405"></span>[\*](#fn_405.md) it is said that "the
gods and asuras, both descendants of Prajāpati, <span
id="fr_406"></span>[†](#fn_406.md) obtained their father's inheritance,
truth and falsehood. The gods, abandoning falsehood, adopted truth; the
asuras, abandoning truth, adopted falsehood. Speaking truth exclusively,
the gods became weaker, but in the end became prosperous; the asuras,
speaking falsehood exclusively, became rich, but in the end succumbed."
The gods tried to sacrifice, but though interrupted at first by the
asuras, at length succeeded, and so became superior to their foes.
Another legend in the same book teaches that the asuras, when offering
sacrifices, placed the oblations in their own mouths, whilst the gods
gave their oblations to each other; at length Prajāpati giving himself
to them, the sacrifices, which supply the gods with food, were
henceforth enjoyed by them.

Although there were frequent wars between the gods and asuras, the suras
were not averse to receive the aid of their foes at the churning of the
ocean; and some of them were not inferior in power and skill to the
gods. Bāli, one of their number, is worshipped by the Hindus on their
birthday; and Jalandhara conquered in battle even Vishnu himself; Indra
and the other gods fled before him, and Siva, unaided, could not destroy
him. Rāhu is an asura, and it was to destroy some of these mighty beings
who distressed the gods, that Durgā and Kāli had to put forth their
strength. In the constant wars between these rivals, Sukra, the
preceptor of the asuras, was frequently called to resuscitate the
fallen. The following story of Jalandhara from the Uttara

<span id="page_441">p. 441</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Khānda of the
"Padma Purāna" <span id="fr_407"></span>[\*](#fn_407.md) will illustrate
the teaching of the later Hindu Scriptures respecting the asuras.

##### JALANDHARA.

The story of Jalandhara's birth and life was narrated by Nārada to the
Pāndavas to encourage them when they were in distress on account of
their misfortunes. He reminds them that adversity and prosperity come to
all: Rāhu, who swallows the sun, is the same Rāhu whose head was severed
from his body by Vishnu; and the valiant Jalandhara, the son of the
Ocean and the river Ganges, who on one occasion conquered Vishnu, was
himself slain by Siva. The mention of this fact excites the curiosity of
his hearers; and in answer to their inquiry about him, Nārada gives the
following history.

Indra and the other gods, arriving at Siva's home on Mount Kailāsa to
pay him a visit, informed the bull Nandi, the chief of Siva's
attendants, that they had come to amuse his master with song and dance.
Siva invites them to enter, and, being delighted with their music, tells
Indra to ask a boon, who, in a defiant tone, asks that he might be a
warrior like Siva himself. The boon is granted, and the gods depart. No
sooner have they left than Siva asks his attendants if they had not
noticed Indra's haughty tone, when immediately there stood before him a
form of anger, black as darkness, who said to Siva, "Give me thy
similitude, and then what can I do for you?" Siva tells him to
incorporate himself with the river of heaven (Gangā), form a union
between her and the Ocean, and conquer Indra.

<span id="page_442">p. 442</span>

In obedience to Siva's command, Gangā left the skies, and becoming
united to the Ocean, from them a son proceeded, at whose birth the earth
trembled and wept, and the three worlds resounded with noise. Brahmā
coming to inquire the cause of this commotion, and asking to see the
child, Gangā lays it in his lap, when it seized his head, and would not
loose it until its father opened its hand. Brahmā, admiring the child's
strength, said, "From his holding so firmly, let him be named
Jalandhara," and bestowed upon him this boon, that he " should be
unconquered by the gods, and enjoy the three worlds."

Jalandhara's boyhood was full of wonders. Borne up by the wind, he flew
over the ocean; his pets were lions which he had caught; and the largest
birds and fishes were subject to him. When he grew up to manhood, at
Sukra's request, his father withdrew the sea from Jambadwipa, the
residence of holy men, which became his home, and bearing his name has
become celebrated. <span id="fr_408"></span>[\*](#fn_408.md) Māya, the
architect of the asuras, there built him a beautiful city, his father
installed him as king, and Sukra gave him the charm by which he could
raise the dead to life. He married Vrindā, the daughter of an Apsaras
named Swarnā, and soon after his wedding made war upon the gods.

In order to lead to a conflict, he sent a messenger to Indra, whom he
found "surrounded by three hundred and thirty-three millions of
deities," to demand the restoration of the moon, the amrita, elephant,
horse, gem, tree, and other things of which he said Indra had robbed
him, at the churning of his uncle, the Sea of Milk; and also to resign
Swarga. As Indra refuses to accede to this request, Jalandhara raises an
army of warriors

<span id="page_443">p. 443</span>

having the heads of horses, elephants, camels, cats, tigers and lions,
with which Indra's abode is soon surrounded. The gods in their extremity
resort to Vishnu for aid.

On Vishnu's arrival the battle commences. Multitudes are slain on both
sides, but the gods, when wounded, resort to the mountains, where they
find herbs which quickly restore them. At length the greater gods and
the leaders of the daityas personally engage in conflict; Indra falls
insensible, Rudra is taken prisoner, and Kuvera is laid low by a blow of
a mace. After this, the tide turns in favour of the gods. When Indra
struck Bāli, the most costly gems dropped from his mouth; he therefore
asked for his body, and with his thunderbolt cut it into many parts.
"From the purity of his actions, the parts of his body became the germs
of the various gems. From his bones came diamonds, from his eyes
sapphires, from his blood rubies, from his marrow emeralds, from his
flesh crystals, from his tongue coral, and from his teeth pearls."

Indra being in his turn attacked by Jalandhara, Vishnu comes to the
rescue; and though the asuras attack him in immense numbers, and the sky
is dark with their arrows, Vishnu overthrows them as if they were
leaves. One of their number, named Shailaroma, losing his head, seized
hold of Garuda, Vishnu's marvellous bird, when the severed head
immediately rejoined his body; Garuda, seeing this wonderful event, flew
oft with his master. Jalandhara was prevent from following him, as he
had to call in the aid of Sukra to restore his warriors to life.

Hearing that the soldiers of the gods were also restored to life through
using herbs obtained from an island called Drona, situated in the Sea of
Milk, he asked his uncle to submerge it. Being deprived of this

<span id="page_444">p. 444</span>

means of restoration, they appealed to Vishnu, who, attacking
Jalandhara, was laid low by the daitya, and would have been slain but
for Lakshmi's intercession with her cousin. In return for his life
Vishnu promised to remain near the Sea of Milk. Jalandhara, having now
conquered the gods, enjoyed peace and happiness.

The gods, however, being expelled from heaven, and deprived of
sacrifices and the amrita, did not long remain contented with their lot.
They went together to Brahmā, who conducted them to Siva, whom they
found "seated on a throne and attended by myriads of devoted servants,
naked, deformed, curly-haired, with matted locks and covered with dust."
On Brahmā' stating the case for the gods, Siva declared that, if Vishnu
had been unsuccessful in fighting the demon, it was impossible that he
alone could overcome him; he therefore advised that the gods should
unite to form a weapon by which their common enemy might be destroyed.
Acting on this advice, the gods, glowing with anger, darted forth
volumes of flames, to which Siva added the consuming beams of his third
eye. Vishnu, too, when summoned, added his flame of anger, and asked
Siva to destroy the daitya, excusing himself from the task on the ground
that Jalandhara was a relative of Lakshmi. Visvakarma and the deities
were alarmed as they saw the glowing mass; but Siva, placing his heel on
it, whirled round with it, and formed it into the discus called
Sudarsana, which sent forth such fiery beams that the gods cried out,
"Preserve us!" Brahmā's beard was scorched as he took it into his
hand—"such is the result of offering a gift to a blockhead"—but Siva hid
it under his arm.

Nārada informed Jalandhara of the intended attack

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span>

of Siva, and, enlarging on Pārvati's beauty, excited him to attack her
husband that he might win her. With this object he sent Rāhu as an
ambassador, to summon the god to submission. On his arrival at the court
the envoy delivered his master's message to Siva, in the form of
Panchānana, who did not deign to speak; but the snake Vasuki, falling to
the ground from his hair, began to eat Ganesa's rat. Seeing this,
Kartikeya's peacock made such an awful noise that the snake disgorged
the rat and returned to his proper place.

Lakshmi then entered the assembly with a vessel of amrita, with which
she resuscitated Brahmā's fifth head that was in Siva's hand; the head
rolling on the ground uttered most boastful language, until myriads of
hideous forms from Siva's locks quieted it. Rāhu, seeing all this, asked
Siva to forsake his wife and children, and live a mendicant's life. At a
sign from Siva, Nandi, the bull, showed him the door; this was the
answer vouchsafed to the illustrious master's demand.

War being determined on, Jalandhara marched first to Kailāsa; but
finding that Siva had forsaken it and taken up a position on a mountain
near Lake Manasa, he surrounded the mountain with his troops. Nandi
marched against them, and spread destruction "like the waters of the
deluge;" reserves, however, being brought up, the army of the gods
suffers loss. Pārvati, hearing that her sons, Ganesa and Kartikeya, are
hardly pressed, urged her husband to go in person and put forth his
energy, though not to expose himself unnecessarily. Before leaving home,
Siva carefully warned Pārvati to be on her guard during his absence, as
it was possible the daitya in some disguise might visit her; after this,
accompanied by Virabhadra and Manibhadra, two forms

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

of his anger, he went to the field of battle. When the conflict between
the daityas and the attendants of Siva had continued for some time,
Jalandhara devised a plan by which he hoped to succeed more easily than
by fighting. Giving his own form and the command of his troops to a
chief, the daitya king assumed the form of Siva, changed Durwarana into
Nandi, and, taking the heads of Ganesa and Kartikeya under his arms,
hastened to Siva's abode. Seeing this, Pārvati was overwhelmed with
grief; but having some doubt of his being the real Siva, she hid herself
and would not listen to his overtures of love. To make certain of his
identity, she caused one of her attendants to assume her form and visit
the daitya, who, returning with the information that he was not the true
Siva, Pārvati hid herself in a lotus, and her companions were changed
into bees which hovered around her.

In the mean time Vishnu had been more successful with Vrindā, the wife
of Jalandhara. In the guise of a Brāhman, he made a hermitage near her
palace, and caused her to dream that she saw her husband's head severed
from his body, his flesh eaten by wild animals, and his eyes plucked out
by vultures. Distracted with her dream, in a high fever she rushed into
the forest, where an ogress met her, ate her mules, and was about to
attack her, when the Brāhman came to her rescue. On reaching the
hermitage, Vishnu induced her to enter, changed himself into the form of
her husband, and there they lived together for some time. At length
Vrindā, seeing through the disguise, cursed Vishnu, telling him that, as
he had wronged Jalandhara, he would himself be wronged, and, having
purified herself from her sin, died. Her body was burned, her mother
collected the ashes, and threw them into the Ganges. The forest in

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

which she was burned has ever since borne the name of Vrindāvana, <span
id="fr_409"></span>[\*](#fn_409.md) near Mount Govardhana.

Jalandhara, hearing of his wife's deception and death, was mad with
rage; and, leaving the neighbourhood of Pārvati's home, returned to the
field of battle. By Sukra's power his dead heroes were restored to life,
and a grand final charge was made. At length Siva and Jalandhara
personally fight; after a desperate encounter, in which the daitya
employs various magical powers, Siva cuts off his head; but it is no
sooner severed than it resumes its place. Siva in his extremity
summonses to his aid the female forms or energies of the gods, Brāhmi,
Vaishnavi and the rest, who drink up the blood of the giant, and with
their aid Siva succeeds in destroying him, and the gods regain their
kingdom and possessions.
