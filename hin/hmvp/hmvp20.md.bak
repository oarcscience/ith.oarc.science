##### 2. THE KŪRMA OR TORTOISE AVATĀRA.

This incarnation was necessitated by the fact that the gods were in
danger of losing their authority over the demons. In their distress they
applied to Vishnu for help, who told them to churn the sea of milk that
they might procure the *Amrita*, or water of life, by which they would
be made strong, and promised to become the

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

tortoise on which the mountain Mandara as a churning stick should rest.
As a full account of this operation has been already given when
describing Lakshmi, who was one of its chief products, there is no
necessity to repeat it here. A few additional particulars will be found
in the following extract from the "Vishnu Purāna:"— <span
id="fr_146"></span>[\*](#fn_146.md)

"Hari having been entreated to help the gods, thus spoke: 'I will
restore your strength. Do you act as I enjoin. Let all the gods and
asuras cast all sorts of medicinal herbs into the sea of milk, and
together churn the ocean for ambrosia, depending on my aid. To secure
the assistance of the daityas, you must be at peace with them, and
engage to give them an equal share of your associated toil; promising
them that by drinking of the amrita . . . they shall become mighty and
immortal. I will take care that the enemies of the gods shall not
partake of the precious draught; they shall only share in the labour.'"

The gods entered into an arrangement with the asuras, and together they
made the necessary preparations. " The assembled gods were stationed by
Krishna at the tail of the serpent Vasuki (the churning rope), and the
daityas and dānavas at its head and neck. Scorched by the flames emitted
from his inflated hood, the demons were shorn of their glory; whilst the
clouds, driven by his breath towards his tail, refreshed the gods by
vivifying showers. In the midst of the milky sea, Hari himself, in the
form of a tortoise, served as a pivot for the mountain, as it was
whirled around. The holder of the mace and discus was present in other
forms amongst the gods and demons, and assisted to drag the monarch of
the serpent race; and in another vast body sat upon

the summit of the mountain. With one portion of his energy, unseen by
gods and demons, he sustained the serpent king; and with another infused
vigour unto the gods."

Such is the account of this incarnation of Vishnu as taught by the
Purānas; but in the earlier books, where the probable origin of this
legend is found, it is Brahmā, and not Vishnu, that is said to have
assumed the form

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

of a tortoise. In the "Satapatha Brāhmana" are these words: "Having
assumed the form of a tortoise, Prajāpati (Brahmā) created offspring.
That which he created, he made; " hence the word Kūrma. Kasyapa means
tortoise; hence men say, "All creatures are descendants of Kasyapa. This
tortoise is the same as Aditya." As the worship of Brahmā became less
popular, whilst that of Vishnu increased in its attraction, the names,
attributes, and works of the one deity appear to have been transferred
to the other.
