<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kuvera</span>, the god of riches, does not occupy a very conspicuous position in the mythology of the Hindus. No images or pictures of him are to be had, though he is frequently referred to in the R&#257;m&#257;yana as the lord of gold and wealth. "Brahm&#257; had a mental son named Pulastya, who again had a mental son named Gaviputra Vaisravana (Kuvera). The latter deserted his father, and went to Brahm&#257;, who as a reward made him immortal, and appointed him to be the god of riches, with Lanka for his capital, and the car Pushpaka for his vehicle.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> This car was of immense size, and moved at its owner's will at a marvellous speed; R&#257;vana took it by force from Kuvera, at whose death it was restored by R&#257;ma to its original possessor.</p>  
<p>"Pulastya being incensed at this desertion (of his son Kuvera) reproduced the half of himself in the form of Vaisravas, who looked upon Vaisravana with indignation. The latter strove to pacify his father, and with this view gave him three elegant R&#257;kshas&#299;s to attend on him: Pushpotkat&#257;, who had two sons, R&#257;vana and Kumbhakarna; M&#257;lin&#299;, who bore Vibh&#299;shana; and R&#257;k&#257;, who bore Khara and S&#363;parnakha. These sons were all</p>

<p>valiant, skilled in the Vedas and observers of religious rites, but, perceiving the prosperity of Vaisravana, were filled with jealousy. Excepting Khara and S&#363;parnakha, they began to practise austerities to propitiate Brahm&#257;, and at the end of a thousand years R&#257;vana cut off his own head and threw it as an oblation into the fire. Brahm&#257; appeared to put a stop to their austerities, and to offer them boons (except that of immortality). He ordained that R&#257;vana should have heads and shapes at will and be invincible, except by men; that Kumbhakarna should enjoy a long sleep. Having obtained these powers, R&#257;vana expelled Vaisravana from Lanka. Kuvera retired to Gandam&#257;rdana. R&#257;vana having been installed as king, and begun to exercise his power tyrannically, the Rishis resort to Brahm&#257;, who promises that, as R&#257;vana could not be killed by gods or asuras, the four-armed Vishnu, the chief of warriors, should by his (Brahm&#257;'s) appointment descend to earth for his destruction."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The R&#257;m&#257;yana (Uttara K&#257;nda)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> makes Kuvera the grandson, not the son, of Pulastya. In the Krita Yuga the pious Pulastya, being teased with the singing and dancing of different damsels, proclaimed that any one of them whom he saw near his hermitage should become a mother. This threat had not been heard by the daughter of Trinavindu, who came near the hermitage, and incurred Pulastya's threatened punishment. Her father, on learning her condition, gave her as wife to Pulastya, and she bore him a son named Visravas; who, becoming a sage, married a daughter of the Muni Bharadvaja, whose son Brahm&#257;, named Vaisravana (Kuvera). He performed austerities for thousands of years, and received as a boon from Brahm&#257; that he should be the</p>

<p>god of riches, and one of the guardians of the world. At the suggestion of his father Visravas, he took possession of Lanka for his abode, which was formerly built by Visvakarma for the R&#257;kshasas, who through fear of Vishnu had recently forsaken it.</p>  
<p>A R&#257;kshas prince named Sumali, who had been driven to P&#257;t&#257;la, happening to visit the earth, saw Kuvera travelling in his chariot to visit his father. This leads him to devise a plan by which he might regain his former position. He sends his daughter Kaikasi to woo Visravas; she is kindly received and becomes the mother of R&#257;vana, Kumbhakarna, S&#363;parnakha and Vibhishana. When Kaikasi saw the splendour of Kuvera, she urges R&#257;vana to resemble him in glory; who, in order to effect this, undergoes most severe austerities for a thousand years, when Brahm&#257; grants him as a boon invincibility against all beings more powerful than men, and other gifts. Kuvera on R&#257;vana's demand yields the city of Lanka.</p>  
<p>It was noticed above that Kuvera was one of the guardians of the world; these are commonly said to be four in number. R&#257;ma mentions their names:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"May he whose hands the thunder wield [Indra],<br> &nbsp;Be in the East thy guard and shield:<br> &nbsp;May Yama's care the South befriend,<br> &nbsp;And Varuna's arm the West defend;<br> &nbsp;And let Kuvera, Lord of Gold,<br> &nbsp;The North with firm protection hold."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> When eight guardians are spoken of, the additional four are these: Agni has charge of the South-East, Surya of the South-West, Soma of the North-East, and V&#257;yu of the North-West.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_391"><font size="1" color="green">p. 391</font></A></p>  
<p>Kuvera is called the King of the Y&#257;kshasas&#8212;savage beings who, because the moment they were born said, "Let us eat," were called Y&#257;kshasas. These beings were ever on the watch for prey, and ate those they slew in battle.</p>  
<p>Throughout the R&#257;m&#257;yana there are brief references to Kuvera as the giver of riches, and also to the beauty of his palace and gardens. Thus Bharadv&#257;ja the sage, desirous of giving R&#257;ma and Lakshman a fitting reception, said&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Here let Kuvera's garden rise,<br> &nbsp;Which far in Northern Kuru lies;<br> &nbsp;For leaves let cloth and gems entwine,<br> &nbsp;And let its fruit be nymphs divine."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>His garden is a place "where the inhabitants enjoy a natural perfection, attended with complete happiness, obtained without exertion. There is there no vicissitude, nor decrepitude, nor death, nor fear; no distinction of virtue and vice, none of the inequalities denoted by the words 'best,' 'worst,' and 'intermediate,' nor any change resulting from the succession of the four Yugas. There is neither grief, weariness, anxiety, hunger, nor fear. The people live in perfect health, free from every suffering, for ten or twelve thousand years."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> As Sugriva was sending forth his armies to search for Sita, he thus speaks of this garden to Satabal, the leader of the army of the North&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"Pursue your onward way, and haste<br> &nbsp;Through the dire horrors of the waste,<br> &nbsp;Until triumphant with delight<br> &nbsp;You reach Kail&#257;sa's glittering height.</small></div></p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &nbsp;There stands a palace decked with gold,<br> &nbsp;For King Kuvera wrought of old,<br> &nbsp;A home the heavenly artist planned,<br> &nbsp;And fashioned with his cunning hand.<br> &nbsp;There lotuses adorn the flood<br> &nbsp;With full-blown flower and opening bud,<br> &nbsp;Where swans and mallards float, and gay<br> &nbsp;Apsarasas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> come down to play.<br> &nbsp;There King Vaisravan's self, the lord<br> &nbsp;By all the universe adored,<br> &nbsp;Who golden gifts to mortals sends,<br> &nbsp;Lives with the Guhyakas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> his friends."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>As R&#257;ma and Lakshman were wandering in the forest, they were attacked by a giant named Vir&#257;dha; but as they could not slay him with their weapons, they buried him alive, and as a result he regained his proper form. Formerly Kuvera had cursed him, for "loving Rambh&#257;'s charms too well," to assume the hideous form in which R&#257;ma met with him, and the only relief Kuvera would give him was&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>"When R&#257;ma, Dasaratha's son,<br> &nbsp;Destroys thee, and the fight is won,<br> &nbsp;Thy proper shape once more assume,<br> &nbsp;And heaven again shall give thee room."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A></small></div></p>  
<p>When R&#257;vana had risen to the summit of his power, he made the gods perform various offices in his house: thus Indra prepared garlands, Agni was his cook, Surya gave light by day and Chandra by night, and Kuvera became his cash-keeper.</p>  
<p>Kuvera married Yakshi or Charvi; and two of his sons, through a curse of the sage N&#257;rada, became trees, in which condition they remained until Krishna, when</p>

<p>an infant, uprooted them. N&#257;rada met with them in a forest, bathing with their wives, in a state of intoxication. The wives, ashamed of themselves, fell at N&#257;rada's feet and sought for pardon; but as their husbands disregarded the presence of the sage, they suffered the full effects of his curse.</p>
