##### 9. THE BUDDHA AVATĀRA.

This incarnation of Vishnu is "originally foreign to the cycle of the
Avatāras of Vishnu, and therefore is only briefly alluded to in some of
Purānas. Where this is done, the intention must have been to effect a
compromise between Brāhmanism and Buddhism, by trying to represent the
latter religion as not irreconcilably

antagonistic to the former." <span id="fr_217"></span>[\*](#fn_217.md)
Colonel Kennedy, <span id="fr_218"></span>[†](#fn_218.md) on the other
hand, argues that the Buddha of the Purānas and Buddha the founder of
the Buddhist system of religion have nothing in common but the name, and
that the attempted identification of these two is simply

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

the work of European scholars, who have not been sufficiently careful to
collect information, and to weigh the evidence they have had before
them. There can be

</span>

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

little doubt that Colonel Kennedy's view is untenable. Seeing the bitter
antagonism that existed between the advocates of the rival systems, it
need occasion no surprise that full accounts of Buddha are not to be
found in Brāhmanical books, nor that the meagre accounts that are there
should try to represent him as a despicable character. The Brāhmanical
writers were far too shrewd to admit that one who exerted such immense
influence, and won so many disciples, could be other than an incarnation
of deity; but as his teaching was opposed to their own they cleverly say
that it was to mislead the enemies of the gods that he promulgated his
doctrine, that they, becoming weak and wicked through error, might be
led once again to seek the help and blessing of those whom they had
previously neglected.

The Purānic account of Buddha will be given, supplemented by further
particulars of his life and work from Buddhist writings.

In the "Bhāgavata Purāna" <span id="fr_219"></span>[\*](#fn_219.md) are
only four short passages respecting him. "At the commencement of the
Kāli-yuga will Vishnu become incarnate in Kikata, under the name of
Buddha, the son of Jina, for the purpose of deluding the enemies of the
gods." "The Undiscernible Being, having assumed a mortal form, preached
heretical doctrines in the three cities founded by Māya (and in Kāsi),
for the purpose of destroying, by deluding them, the enemies of the
gods, steadfast in the religion prescribed by the Vedas." "Praise to the
pure Buddha, the deluder of the Daityas and the Dānavas." "By his words,
as Buddha, Vishnu deludes the heretics."

In the Skanda, <span id="fr_220"></span>[†](#fn_220.md) the legend, of
which the Bhāgavata gives but the merest outline, is more fully given.
There was a dire famine in the earth, owing to the failure of

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

rains for six successive years. On this account Brahmā in great distress
visited a prince named Ripanjaya, and told him that if he would become
king, the gods would serve him, and his name should be changed to
Divodāsa. On asking why he was chosen before all others, Brahmā tells
him, "All other kings are wicked, and the gods will not shower rain upon
the earth unless you accept the government. Divodāsa accedes to Brahmā's
request on condition that that deity would assist him and that all the
other gods would forsake the earth, so that he might reign without a
rival, and be the only one who could confer happiness on men. Brahmā, in
fulfilling this condition, with some difficulty persuaded Siva to
forsake Kāsi (Benares), his favourite dwelling-place.

Divodāsa fixed his throne at Kāsi, where for 8000 years he ruled with
the greatest benefit to men. The gods becoming jealous of his power went
to Vrihaspati, their preceptor, and, whilst they spoke well of the
effects of the king's government, complained that he, and not the gods,
was benefited by it. Siva especially was annoyed at his enforced absence
from Kāsi; for although he sent several times to make inquiries about
its inhabitants, his messengers were too happy on earth to return to
their lord in heaven. Vishnu, accompanied by Lakshmi and Garuda, at
Siva's request, "then proceeded to Kāsi, a little to the north of which
he formed by his divine power a pleasant abode named Dharmakshetra, and
there, attended by his lovely spouse, did he reside under the form of
Buddha, while Lakshmi became a female recluse of that sect. Garuda also
appeared under the name of Panyakirti, as a pupil with a book in his
hand, and attentively listening to the delusive instructions of his
preceptor (Buddha), who with a low,

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

sweet, and affectionate voice taught him various branches of natural and
supernatural religion."

Vishnu, as Buddha, taught that "the universe was without a creator; it
is false therefore to assert that there is one universal and Supreme
Spirit, for Brahmā, Vishnu, Rudra, and the rest are names of mere
corporeal beings like ourselves. Death is a peaceful sleep: why fear
it?" He further taught that "we should guard as our own life the life of
another; that pleasure is the only heaven, and pain the only hell, and
liberation from ignorance the sole beatitude. Sacrifices are acts of
folly." Through the exertions of Panyakirti, these doctrines soon spread
through the city; whilst Lakshmi deluded the women by teaching them to
"place all happiness in sensual pleasures; as the body must decay, let
us, before it becomes dust, enjoy the pleasures which it gives. The
distinction of castes has been vainly imagined." As Lakshmi gave
numerous boons to her disciples, her influence was great, and her
teaching spread widely.

As a result of the dissemination of these doctrines in the city,
Divodāsa became dispirited. Vishnu in the form of a Brāhman appeared to
him, and hears an account of his troubles, and is delighted as he
expresses a wish to resign his crown, The king mentions a number of
cases in which virtuous men have had to suffer, owing to the power of
the gods, and inquires how he can obtain final beatitude. Vishnu informs
him that he has acted unwisely in compelling Siva to forsake Kāsi, and
advises him to consecrate an image of that god, by worshipping which he
will obtain the fulfilment of his desires. Divodāsa follows this
counsel, inaugurates his son as king, and as he is worshipping the Linga
he had set up, Siva appears and conducts him to Kailasa (Siva's heaven).
It is the common belief of the people

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

in the west of India, that when Vishnu had effected the apostasy of
Divodāsa, he was prevailed upon to terminate the propagation of his
heretical opinions, and disappeared in a deep well at Gya.

The following legend from the "Siva Purāna" <span
id="fr_221"></span>[\*](#fn_221.md) gives another reason for the rise of
Buddhism. A famous Rishi named Gautama, with his virtuous wife named
Ahalyā, performed during a thousand years a severe *tapas* (penance) in
the southern country near the mountain Brahmādri. During this time there
was a severe drought, to remove which, Gautama worshipped Varuna for six
months with great fervour, when the deity promised to grant any boon
that should be asked. Gautama asked for rain, but Varuna said, "How can
I transgress the divine command? Ask some boon which it is in my power
to grant." Gautama then desired Varuna to cause a surpassingly beautiful
hermitage to appear, shaded from the sun by fragrant and fruit-bearing
trees, where holy men and women by meditation shall be liberated from
pain, sorrow, and anxiety; "and as thou art lord of water, let it enjoy
a perennial fountain." Varuna granted this request, and the hermitage of
Gautama became "the loveliest on the terrestrial orb."

One day as the disciples of Gautama went to the fountain, some Brāhman
women tried to prevent them drawing water until they had filled their
own pots. Ahalyā going herself was subjected daily to the same
annoyance: the Brāhman women would not allow her to draw water before
they had themselves obtained all they required. These women, not
satisfied with annoying the ascetics, complained to their husbands of
the unkind treatment they alleged they had received from Ahalyā.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Their husbands
resorted to Ganesa for advice, who being pleased with their devotion
promised a boon; they asked that Gautama might be made to leave his
hermitage without their incurring the sin of driving him away. To this
Ganesa reluctantly consented; and in order to effect this object he
transformed himself into a poor debilitated cow, and walked into a field
of rice where Gautama was standing, and began to eat the grain. The
sage, knowing nothing of this disguise, took up a straw and tried to
drive the cow away; no sooner did he touch it than it fell down dead.
Having incurred the enormous guilt of killing a cow, the poor man had to
leave the neighbourhood.

Gautama and his wife removed to a distance; but until he had expiated
his sin they could not perform acceptable worship. Gautama seeks the
Brāhmans, and asking how he can be free from his crime, is told to walk
round the mountain of Brahmā a hundred times; bathe in the Ganges, and
consecrate and worship ten million images of Siva. As he is propitiating
him, Siva, delighted with the man's earnestness, appears, informs him of
the trick by which Ganesa had driven him from the hermitage, and brings
the Ganges so near that he can bathe in it easily. Tradition says that
Gautama was so disgusted with the conduct of the Brāhmans that he
separated himself from their communion, and established a new system of
religion, which for a time eclipsed Brahmanism.

The following extracts, giving an account of Buddha, are from the
"Lalita-Vistara," <span id="fr_222"></span>[\*](#fn_222.md) a Buddhist work
from which M. Barthélemy St. Hilaire has taken the materials for his
work, "La Boudda et sa Religion."

"Buddha, or more correctly The Buddha—for Buddha

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

is an appellative, meaning enlightened—was born at Kapilavastu, the
capital of a kingdom of that name, situated at the foot of the mountains
of Nepal, north of the present Oude. His father, the King of
Kapilavastu, was of the family of the Sākyas, and belonged to the clan
of the Gautamas. His mother was Māyādevi, daughter of King Suprabuddha,
and need we say that she was beautiful, as he was powerful and just?
Buddha

<span id="img_23200"></span> <span align="CENTER">

BUDDHA.  
</span>

was therefore by birth of the Kshattriya, or warrior caste, and he took
the name of Sākya from his family, and that of Gautama from his clan,
claiming a kind of spiritual relationship with the honoured race of
Gautamas. The name of Buddha, or The Buddha, dates from a latter period
of his life, and so probably does Siddhārtha (he whose objects have been
accomplished), though we are told that it was given him in his
childhood.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> His mother died
seven days after his birth, and the father confided the child to the
care of his deceased wife's sister, who, however, had been his wife even
before the mother's death. The child grew up a most beautiful and most
accomplished boy, who soon knew more than his masters could teach him.
He refused to take part in the games of his playmates, and never felt so
happy as when he could sit alone, lost in meditation in the deep shadows
of the forest. It was there that his father found him when he had
thought him lost; and, in order to prevent the young prince from
becoming a dreamer, the king determined to marry him at once. When the
subject was mentioned by the aged ministers to the future heir to the
throne, he demanded seven days for reflection, and, convinced at last
that not even marriage could disturb the calm of his mind, he allowed
the ministers to look out for a princess. The princess selected was the
beautiful Gopā, the daughter of Dandapani. Though her father objected at
first to her marrying a young prince who was represented to him as
deficient in manliness and intellect, he gladly gave his consent when he
saw the royal suitor distancing all his rivals in feats of arms and
power of mind. Their marriage proved one of the happiest, but the prince
remained, as he had been before, absorbed in meditations on the problems
of life and death. 'Nothing is stable on earth,' he used to say;
'nothing is real. Like is like the spark produced by the friction of
wood. It is lighted and is extinguished—we know not whence it came, or
whither it goes. It is like the sound of a lyre, and the wise man asks
in vain from whence it came and whither it goes. There must be some
supreme intelligence where we can find rest. If I attained it I could
bring light to man; if I were free myself, I could deliver

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

the world.' The king, who perceived the melancholy mood of the young
prince, tried everything to divert him from his speculations; but all
was in vain. Three of the most ordinary events that could happen to any
man proved of the utmost importance in the career of Buddha.

"One day, when the prince with a large retinue was driving through the
Eastern gate of the city on the way to one of his parks, he met on the
road an old man, broken and decrepit. One could see the veins and
muscles over the whole of his body; his teeth chattered, he was covered
with wrinkles, bald, and hardly able to utter hollow and unmelodious
sounds. He was bent on his stick, and all his limbs and joints trembled.
'Who is this man?' said the prince to his coachman. 'He is small and
weak, his flesh and his blood are dried up, his muscles stick to his
skin, his teeth chatter, his body is wasted away; leaning on his stick,
he is hardly able to walk, stumbling at every step. Is there something
peculiar in his family, or is this the common lot of all created
beings?'

"'Sir,' replied the coachman, 'that man is sinking under old age, his
senses have become obscure, suffering has destroyed his strength, and he
is despised by his relations. He is without support and useless, and
people have abandoned him, like a dead tree in a forest. But this is not
peculiar to his family. In every creature youth is defeated by old age.
Your father, your mother, all your relations, all your friends, will
come to the same state: this is the appointed end of all creatures.'

"'Alas!' replied the prince, 'are creatures so ignorant, so weak and
foolish, as to be proud of the youth by which they are intoxicated, not
seeing the old age which awaits them? As for me, I go away. Coachman,
turn

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

my chariot quickly. What am I, the future prey of old age—what have I to
do with pleasure? ' and the young prince returned to the city without
going to the park.

"Another time the prince was driving through the Southern gate to his
pleasure-garden, when he perceived in the road a man suffering from
illness, parched with fever, his body wasted, covered with mud, without
a friend, without a home, hardly able to breathe, and frightened at the
sight of himself and the approach of death. Having questioned his
coachman, and received from him the answer which he expected, the young
prince said: 'Alas! health is but the sport of a dream, and the fear of
suffering must take this frightful form. Where is the wise man, who,
after having seen what he is, could any longer think of joy and
pleasure?' The prince turned his chariot, and returned to the city.

"A third time he was driving to his pleasure-garden through the Western
gate, when he saw a dead body on the road, lying on a bier and covered
with a cloth. The friends stood about crying, sobbing, tearing their
hair, covering their heads with dust, striking their breasts, and
uttering wild cries. The prince, again calling his coachman to witness
this painful scene, exclaimed: 'Oh, woe to youth, which must be
destroyed by old age! Woe to health, which must be destroyed by so many
diseases! Woe to this life, where a man must remain for so short a
time!' Then, betraying for the first time his intentions, the young
prince said, 'Let us turn back; I must think how to accomplish
deliverance.'

"A last meeting put an end to his meditation. He was driving through the
Northern gate on the way to his pleasure-gardens, when he saw a
mendicant who appeared outwardly calm, subdued, looking downwards,

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

wearing with an air of dignity his religious vestment and carrying an
alms-bowl.

"'Who is this man? ' asked the prince.

"'Sir,' replied the coachman, 'this man is one of those who are called
*bhikshus* or mendicants. He has renounced all pleasures, all desires,
and leads a life of austerity. He tries to conquer himself. He has
become a devotee. Without passion, without envy, he walks about asking
for alms.'

"'This is good and well said,' replied the prince. The life of a devotee
has always been praised by the wise. It will be my refuge, and the
refuge of all other creatures. It will lead us to a real life, to
happiness and immortality.' With these words, the young prince turned
his chariot and returned to the city.

"After having declared to his father and his wife his intention of
retiring from the world, Buddha left his palace one night when all the
guards that were to have watched him were asleep. After travelling the
whole night, he gave his horse and his ornaments to his groom, and sent
him back to Kapilavastu. 'A monument,' remarks the author of the
'Lalita-Vistara,' 'is still to be seen on the spot where the coachman
turned back.' Hiouen Thsang saw the same monument at the edge of a large
forest; on his road to Kusinagara, a city now in ruins, and situated
about fifty miles E.S.E. from Gorakpore.

"Buddha first went to Vaisali, and became the pupil of a famous Brāhman,
who had gathered round him 300 disciples. Having learnt all that the
Brāhman could teach him, Buddha went away disappointed. He had not found
the road to salvation. He then tried another Brāhman at Rājagriha, the
capital of Magadha or Behar, who had 700 disciples, and there, too, he
looked in vain

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

for the means of deliverance. He left him, followed by five of his
fellow-students, and for six years retired into solitude, near a village
named Uruvilva, subjecting himself to the most severe penances, previous
to his appearing in the world as a teacher. At the end of this period,
however, he arrived at the conviction that asceticism, far from giving
peace of mind and preparing the way to salvation, was a snare and a
stumbling-block in the way of truth. He gave up his exercises, and was
at once deserted as an apostate by his five disciples. Left to himself,
he now began to elaborate his own system. He had learned that neither
the doctrines nor the austerities of the Brāhmans were of any avail for
accomplishing the deliverance of man, and for freeing him from the fear
of old age, disease, and death. After long meditations and ecstatic
visions, he at last imagined that he had arrived at that true knowledge
which discloses the cause, and thereby destroys the fear, of all the
changes inherent in life. It was from the moment when he arrived at this
knowledge that he claimed the name of Buddha the enlightened. Buddha
hesitated for a time whether he should keep his knowledge to himself or
communicate it to the world. Compassion for the sufferings of man
prevailed, and the young prince became the founder of a religion which,
after more than 2000 years, is still professed by 455,000,000 of human
beings.

"The further history of the new teacher is very simple. He proceeded to
Benares, which at all times has been the principal seat of learning in
India, and the first converts he made were the five fellow-students who
had left him when he threw off the yoke of the Brāhmanical observances.
Many others followed, but as the Lalita-Vistara ' breaks off at Buddha's
arrival at Benares, we have no further consecutive account of the

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

rapid progress of his doctrine. From what we can gather from scattered
notices in the Buddhist canon, he was invited by the King of Magadha,
Bimbisāra, to his capital, Rājagriha. Many of his lectures are
represented as having been delivered at the monastery of Kalavataka,
with which the king or some rich merchant had presented him; others on
the Vulture Peak, one of the five hills which surround the ancient
capital.

"Three of his most famous disciples—Sariputra, Kātyāyana, and
Maudgalyāyana joined him during his stay in Magadha, where he enjoyed
for many years the friendship of the king. The king was afterwards
assassinated by his son Ajātāsatru, and then we hear of Buddha as
settled for a time at Srāvasti, north of the Ganges. Most of Buddha's
lectures were delivered at Srāvasti, the capital of Kosala, and the King
of Kosala himself, Prāsenagit, became a convert to his doctrine. After
an absence of twelve years, we are told that Buddha visited his father
at Kapilavastu, on which occasion he performed several miracles, and
converted all the Sākyas to his faith. His own wife became one of his
followers, and, with his aunt, offer the first instance of female
Buddhist devotees in India.

"We have fuller particulars again of the last days of Buddha's life. He
had attained the good age of threescore years and ten, and had been on a
visit to Rājagriha, where the king, Ajātāsatru, the former enemy of
Buddha and the assassin of his own father, had joined the congregation,
after making a public confession of his crimes. On his return he was
followed by a large number of disciples, and when on the point of
crossing the Ganges, he stood on a square stone, and, turning his eyes
back towards Rājagriha, he said, full of emotion, 'This is the last time
that I shall see that city.' He likewise visited

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vaisali, and,
after taking leave . of it, he had nearly reached the city of
Kusināgara, when his vital strength began to fail. He halted in a
forest, and, while sitting under a Sāl tree, he gave up the ghost, or,
as a Buddhist would say, entered into Nirvāna."

The following verses by Dr. Muir <span id="fr_223"></span>[\*](#fn_223.md)
are a translation of part of the "Lalita-Vistara," from which the
quotations given above were made:—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"On Himālaya's lonely steep  
   There lived of old an holy sage,  
   Of shrivelled form, and bent with age,  
 Inured to meditation deep.

"He—when great Buddha had been born,  
   The glory of the Sākya race,  
   Endowed with every holy grace,  
 To save the suffering world forlorn—

"Beheld strange portents, signs which taught  
   The wise that that auspicious time  
   Had witnessed some event sublime,  
 With universal blessing fraught.

"The sky with joyful gods was thronged:  
   He heard their voice with glad acclaim  
   Resounding loudly Buddha's name,  
 While echoes clear their shouts prolonged.

"The cause exploring, far and wide  
   The sage's vision ranged; with awe,  
   Within a cradle laid, he saw  
 Far off the babe, the Sakyas' pride.

"With longing seized this child to view  
   At hand, and clasp, and homage pay,  
   Athwart the sky he took his way  
 By magic art, and swan-like flew;

"And came to King Suddhōdan's gates;  
   And entrance craved—'Go, royal page,  
   And tell thy lord an ancient sage  
 To see the king permission waits.'

"The page obeyed, and joined his hands  
   Before the prince, and said, 'A sage

"The saint beside the monarch stood,

   With length of life, and might, and wealth;  
 And ever seek thy people's good.'

"With all due forms and meet respect  
   The king received the holy man  
   And bade him sit; and then began—  
 'Great sage, I do not recollect

"'That I thy venerable face

"'To see thy babe,' the saint replies,  
   'I come from Himālaya's steeps.'  
   The king rejoins, 'My infant sleeps;

"'Such great ones ne’er,' the Rishi spike,

   He fell before the Buddha's feet,  
 With fingers joined, and round him paced.

"Next round the babe his arms he wound,

"'If such an one at home abide,

"He spoke, and on the infant gazed,  
   When tears suffused his aged eyes;  
   His bosom heaved with heavy sighs;  
 Then King Suddhōdan asked, amazed—

"'Say, holy man, what makes thee weep

"'And now, at length, this blessed time  
   Has come: for he, who cradled lies  
   An infant there before thine eyes,  
 Shall be a Buddha in his prime.

"'Full, perfect insight gaining, he  
   Shall rescue endless myriads tost  
   On life's rough ocean waves, and lost,  
 And grant them immortality.

"'But I am old, and frail, and worn;  
   I shall not live the day to see  
   When this thy wondrous child shall free  
 From woe the suffering world forlorn.

"'’Tis thus mine own unhappy fate  
   Which bids me mourn, and weep, and sigh;  
   The Buddha's triumph now is nigh,  
 But, ah! for me it comes too late!'

"When thus this aged saint, inspired,  
   Had all the infant's greatness told,  
   The king his wondrous son extolled,  
 And sang, with pious ardour fired—

"'Thee, child, th’ immortals worship all,  
   The great Physician, born to cure  
   All ills that hapless men endure;  
 I, too, before thee prostrate fall!'

"And now—his errand done—the sage,  
   Dismissed with gifts and human due,  
   Athwart the ether swanlike flew,  
 And reached again his hermitage."

Buddhism, the system of religion taught by Buddha, starts with the
doctrine common to it and Hinduism of transmigration. <span
id="fr_224"></span>[\*](#fn_224.md) It then goes on to say that pain and

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

pleasure are simply the result of Karma (works), no notice whatever
being taken of the existence or nonexistence of God. It assumes that
existence is and must be miserable; and that the highest conceivable
good is to obtain entire exemption from existence. Death does not
necessarily bring this exemption; it may be but an entrance into a worse
form of it than is at present endured. Buddha's four " Sublime
verities," containing the germ of his system, are as follows:—The first
is that pain exists; the second, that desire is the cause of pain; the
third, that pain can be ended by Nirvāna, or exemption from existence,
practical annihilation; the fourth shows the way that leads to Nirvāna.
The great thing is to get rid of desire, and when this is accomplished,
the soul is ready for complete Nirvāna, and a man dying in this state
will not again be born. He taught the evil of caste distinctions, and
all who embraced his tenets became members of a great brotherhood.
Instead of the painful mortifications and costly sacrifices by which the
Hindus were compelled to make expiation for sin, he taught that
confession and promise of amendment were all that was necessary. Its
moral code is one of the most perfect in the world: the spring of all
virtue is Maitri, which can only be translated as charity or love. "It
does not express friendship, or the feeling of particular affection
which a man has for one or more of his fellow-creatures, but that
universal feeling which inspires us with good-will towards all men and
constant willingness to help them." <span

There is one peculiarity of the followers of Buddha as compared with the
Hindus, viz. the preservation of and veneration for relics of their
founder. With the exception of a legend stating that Krishna's bones
were

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

placed in the image of Jagannāth, and another teaching that Vishnu cut
the dead body of Sati into fifty-one parts, each of which is now
enshrined in a temple, we have no record of relics being preserved by
the Hindus. But the Buddhists profess to have carefully preserved parts
of their great leader, and enshrine them in Dagobas. One of the most
celebrated of these is represented on page [226](#page_226.md). A tooth of
Buddha is believed to be kept in it; in others a single hair is most
religiously guarded. These Dagobas are not temples, though in some cases
they form part of buildings that are, or have been, used for worship.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[243:\*](hmvp28.htm#fr_224.md) In Hinduism it is
the transmigration of souls from the lowest to the highest scale, until
they become fit for absorption into the Divine from whence they came. At
its close each life is carefully judged, and when next the person
returns to the earth he is born in a higher stage if good preponderated;
in a lower if the evil turned the scale. In Buddhism, which denies the
existence of souls, the transmigration is somewhat different in form. As
soon as a person dies a new being is produced in a more or less
miserable condition, according to the "Karma," the sum total of the good
or evil in all its many previous lives. Practically there is no great
difference between these views. For though the Hindu believes that the
same soul passes through countless changes in successive lives, there is
no memory of previous experience, so that each life is separate and
distinct from what went before. It is a formal rather than a real
difference.
