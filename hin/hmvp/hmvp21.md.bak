##### 3. THE VARĀHA OR BOAR AVATĀRA.

There is the same conflicting account of this as of the two preceding
incarnations; the older books, and some of the more modern ones,
describing it as an Avatāra of Brahmā; and some of the modern books and
popular belief regarding it as the work of Vishnu. There is, however,
this distinction, that in the former, the transformation of the deity
into a boar has apparently a purely cosmical character," the earth being
immersed in the ocean. Brahmā, the Creator, in the shape of a boar,
raised it on his tusk; "whereas, in the latter, it altogether represents
the extrication of the world from a deluge of iniquity by the rites of
religion." <span id="fr_147"></span>[\*](#fn_147.md)

The first mention of this incarnation is in the "Taittiriya
Sanhitā," <span id="fr_148"></span>[†](#fn_148.md) and is as follows: "The
universe was formerly water, fluid. On it Prajāpati (Brahmā) becoming
wind, moved. Becoming a boar, he took it up." In harmony with this is a
verse in the "Taittiriya Brāhmana":—"This universe was formerly water,
fluid. With that (water) Prajāpati practised arduous devotions

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (saying), 'How
shall this universe be (developed)?' He beheld a lotus leaf standing. He
thought, 'There is something on which this rests.' He as a boar—having
assumed that form—plunged beneath towards it. He found the earth down
below. Breaking off (a portion of) her, he rose to the surface." In the
"Satapatha Brāhmana" <span id="fr_149"></span>[\*](#fn_149.md) there is a
similar reference, but there the boar is called "Emusha." Formerly the
earth was only of the size of a span. A boar called Emusha raised her
up.

Dr. Muir <span id="fr_150"></span>[†](#fn_150.md) gives two accounts of
this incarnation from two recensions of the Rāmāyana. In one, which he
considers the older, it is said that Brahmā assumed the form of a boar;
in the other, Vishnu *in the form of Brahmā* is said to have
accomplished this work. The alteration of the text is very noticeable.
"All was water only, in which the earth was formed. Thence arose Brahmā,
the self-existent, with the deities. He then becoming a boar, raised up
the earth, and created the whole world with the saints his sons." So far
the probably older recension. In the later one we read, "All was water
only, through which the earth was formed. Thence arose Brahmā, the
self-existent, the imperishable Vishnu. He then, becoming a boar, raised
up this earth and created the whole world."

In the following account from the "Vishnu Purāna" <span
id="fr_151"></span>[‡](#fn_151.md) it will be noticed that, as in the last
quotation from the Rāmāyana, it was Vishnu in the form of Brahmā who
became a boar. As the earlier writers had declared this to have been
Brahmā's work, it was necessary to identify Vishnu with him.

"Tell me how at the commencement of the present age, Nārāyana, who is
named Brahmā, created all existing

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

things. At the close of the last age, the divine Brahmā endowed with the
quality of goodness, awoke from his night of sleep, and beheld the
universal void. He, the supreme Nārāyana, . . . invested with the form
of Brahmā, . . . concluding that within the waters lay the earth, and
being desirous to raise it up, created another form for that purpose.
And as in the preceding ages he had assumed the shape of a fish, or a
tortoise, so in this he took the form of a boar. Having adopted a form
composed of the sacrifices of the Vedas for the preservation of the
whole earth, the eternal, supreme, and universal soul plunged into the
ocean." In a note on this passage in the "Vishnu Purāna," by Professor
Wilson, it is stated that, according to the "Vāyu Purāna," the form of a
boar was chosen because it is an animal delighting in water; but in
other Purānas, as in the Vishnu, it is said to be a type of the ritual
of the Vedas, for which reason the elevation of the earth on the tusks
of a boar is regarded as an allegorical representation of the
extrication of the world from a deluge of sin, by the rites of religion.

The earth, bowing with devout adoration, addressed the boar, as he
approached, in a hymn of great beauty, in which she reminds him that she
sprang from him, and is dependent on him, as in fact are all things.
Being thus praised, "the auspicious supporter of the world emitted a low
murmuring sound, like the chanting of the Sama-Veda; and the mighty
boar, whose eyes were like the lotus, whose body was vast as the Nila
mountains, and of the dark colour of the lotus leaves, uplifted upon his
ample tusks the earth from its lowest regions. As he reared up his head,
the waters that rushed from his brow purified the great sages, Sanandana
and others residing in the sphere of the saints. Through

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

the indentations made by his hoofs, the waters rushed into the lower
worlds with a thundering noise. Before his breath, the pious denizens of
Janaloka (abode of men) were scattered, and the Munis sought for shelter
amongst the bristles upon the body of the boar, trembling as he rose up
supporting the earth, and dripping with moisture. Then the great sages
Sanandana and the rest, residing continually in the sphere of the
saints, were inspired with delight, and bowing lowly, they praised the
stern-eyed upholder of the earth."

Before noticing the hymn of these saints, in which the boar is
identified with the various parts of worship, we can gather a little
more information from the other Purānas respecting the dimensions, etc.,
of this animal. The Vāyu says, "The boar was ten yojanas <span
id="fr_152"></span>[\*](#fn_152.md) in breadth, and a thousand yojanas in
height; his colour was like a dark cloud, and his roar like thunder. His
bulk was vast as a mountain; his tusks were white, sharp, and fearful;
fire flashed from his eyes like lightning, and he was radiant as the
sun. His shoulders were round, fat, and large; he strode along like a
powerful lion; his haunches were fat, his loins slender, and his body
smooth and beautiful." With this the Matsya agrees. The Bhāgavata
describes the boar "as issuing from the nostrils of Brahmā; at first of
the size of a thumb, and presently increasing to the size of an
elephant." This Purāna adds a legend of the slaying of Hiranyāksha, who,
in a former birth, was a doorkeeper of Vishnu's palace. He having
refused admission to a number of Munis, so enraged them, that they
cursed him; in consequence of this he was re-born as a son of Diti. When
the earth sunk in the waters, Vishnu was seen by this

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

demon in the act of raising it. Hiranyāksha claimed the earth, and
defying Vishnu, they fought, and the demon was slain.

Now follow the hymns to the Varāha as sung by the saints: "Triumph, lord
of lords, supreme! Kesava, sovereign of the earth . . . cause of
production, destruction and existence. Thou art, O god! there is none
other supreme condition than thou. Thou, lord, art the person of the
sacrifice; thy feet are the Vedas; thy tusks are the stake to which the
victim is bound; thy teeth are the offerings; thy mouth is the altar;
thy tongue is the fire; and the hairs of thy body are the sacrificial
grass. Thy eyes, O omnipotent! are day and night; thy head is the seat
of all—the place of Brahmā; thy name is all the hymns of the Vedas; thy
nostrils are all oblations. O thou, whose snout is the ladle of
oblation; whose deep voice is the chanting of the Sama-Veda; whose body
is the hall of sacrifice; whose joints are the different ceremonies; and
whose ears have the properties of both voluntary and obligatory rites;
do thou, who art eternal, who art in size a mountain, be propitious . .
. raise up this earth for the habitation of created beings!"

"The supreme being thus eulogized, upholding the earth, raised it
quickly, and placed it on the summit of the ocean, where it floats like
a mighty vessel, and, on account of its expansive surface, does not sink
beneath the waters." This seems rather to contradict the common notion
of the Hindus, that the earth rests upon the back ōf a tortoise; and
that earthquakes are the result of the tortoise changing the foot on
which he stands, when weary.
