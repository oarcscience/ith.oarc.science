# THE PURĀNIC DEITIES.

### CHAPTER I.

#### THE PURĀNAS.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> chief sources of information
respecting the modern mythology of the Hindus are the two great
Epics—the Rāmāyana and the Mahābhārata—the Purānas, or "old traditional
stories," eighteen in number, and the five principal Tantras.

There is nothing definitely known as to the date of the Epics, beyond
the fact that they are later than the Vedas, and earlier than the
Purānas. Some place the Rāmāyana as early as B.C. 500, whilst others
affirm that it could not have been composed before B.C. 100, and that a
considerable portion was added much later. The Mahābhārata is supposed
to be fully a century nearer our own time. Unlike the Vedas, they, as
well as the Purānas and Tantras, may be read by other than Brāhmans.
Each of these books is of immense bulk, and the same stories frequently
reappear in them. Yet to this day they retain a firm hold of the faith
and veneration of the mass of the people of India. Nor is this to be
wondered at when we read such words as these, often repeated in these
works: "He who reads

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

and repeats this holy life-giving Rāmāyana \[or the Mahābhārata\], is
liberated from all sins, and exalted with all his posterity to the
highest heaven."

It is almost equally difficult to determine the date of the Purānas. It
is, however, believed that none of them are older than the 8th century
A.D., though some of the legends incorporated in them may have come from
much earlier times. That they are considerably later than the two great
Epics is evident from the fact that many, who are described there as men
and heroes only, in the Purānas, are said to be divine beings. These
books differ from the Vedas in this respect, that whilst the older
scriptures treat of the religion common to the Hindus of that period,
all of whom worshipped the same deities, each Purāna is chiefly
concerned with some one god whose excellences are extolled, whilst
others are spoken of in a depreciatory manner. There is a general
respect shown to the rest of the gods of the Pantheon; yet the
particular deity to whose praise the Purāna is devoted, is declared to
be supreme; and of him the others are said to be incarnations. Now
Brahmā, now Siva, now Vishnu in some of his many forms, is the great
god, whose will is that all men should worship him. It may be that
originally the Purānas were written in praise of the three great gods,
but as the Hindu conquest extended over the continent, there being no
central religious authority, a spirit of sectarianism arose and the
writers extolled their own special deity at the expense of the others.

The Purānas may be classified as follows:—

I. Those which are devoted to the praise of Brahmā; viz. the Brahmā; the
Brāhmanda, the Brahmāvaivarta, the Mārkandeya, the Bhavishya, and the
Vaman.

II\. Those which relate to Vishnu; viz. the Vishnu,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

the Bhāgavata, the Naradiya, the Garuda, the Padma, and the Vārāha.

III\. Those which are chiefly connected with Siva; viz. the Siva, the
Linga, the Skanda, the Agni, the Matsya, the Karma. For the Agni Purāna
another called the Vāyu is sometimes substituted.

These Purānas are the authority for nearly the whole of the popular
Hinduism of the present day. They are largely read by the people. Parts
of some and the whole of others have been translated into the
vernaculars from the Sanskrit; and where the people cannot read, it is a
common practice for their Guru or teacher to read a portion to them at
his periodic visits. By this means the contents of these books are
widely known.

The fact that each Purāna is devoted to the praise of some special
deity, who, according to its teaching, is supreme, whilst other deities,
described in other Purānas in equally extravagant language, are
slighted, and in some cases their worship forbidden, seems to prove that
these books must have been written at different times and in different
places, and probably by those who were ignorant of what others had
written. And yet the popular belief is that they were all the work of
the great sage Vyāsa, the arranger of the Vedas and the Mahābhārata.

The ideal Purāna—and the Vishnu Purāna approaches more nearly to this
ideal than any other—should treat of <span
id="fr_89"></span>[\*](#fn_89.md) five chief topics:—"I. The creation of
the universe; II. Its destruction and re-creation; III. The genealogy of
gods and patriarchs; IV. The reigns and periods of the Manus (rulers
over long periods of time); and V. The history of the two great races of
kings, the Solar and the Lunar." The Purānas, as at present known,

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

omit some of these great questions and introduce others. Great
discrepancies, too, are found in the different genealogies. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[\*](#fn_90.md)

The last class of religious books to be mentioned here are the Tantras.
The word signifies "a means of faith," and they teach that faith in the
revelations they record will save from the greatest sin. They are in the
form of a dialogue between Siva and his wife. In answer to her
questions, the god gives manifold instructions concerning worship. The
date of these works is involved in great obscurity; but as far as can be
known they probably are not earlier than the 6th century of our era.
They form the authority for the faith and ceremonies of the Saktas, as
the worshippers of the wife of Siva are called, and are by them regarded
as a fifth Veda. The doctrines, or at least a part of the doctrines, of
these sects is kept secret and communicated to those only who receive
solemn initiation into the mysteries.

In describing the Purānic deities, I shall follow the common order. The
Hindus speak of three great gods—Brahmā, Vishnu, Siva, who form what is
often spoken of as the Hindu Triad. After giving an account of each of
these and their consorts, I shall describe those who are regarded as
their incarnations, or descendants; and then proceed to speak of others
who have no formal connection with any of them. It will be seen that
most of the principal deities are connected with one or other of these
three.
