### CHAPTER VIII.

#### SONS OF SIVA AND PĀRVATI.

##### 1. GANESA.

GANESA is usually regarded as the elder son of Siva and Pārvati, but the
Purānas differ very considerably in their

<span id="img_32300"></span> <span align="CENTER">

GANESA.  
</span>

accounts of his origin. Sir W. Jones says <span
id="fr_284"></span>[\*](#fn_284.md) that " Ganesa, the Indian god of
Wisdom, has the same

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

characteristics as Janus of the Latins. All sacrifices and religious
ceremonies, all serious compositions in writing, and all worldly affairs
of importance are begun by pious Hindus with an invocation to Ganesa; a
word composed of Isa, the governor or leader, and gana, a company (of
deities). Instances of opening business auspiciously by an ejaculation
to him might be multiplied with ease. Few books are begun without the
words, 'Salutation to Ganesa;' and he is first invoked by Brāhmans who
conduct the trial by ordeal, or perform the ceremony of the homa or
sacrifice to fire." M. Sonnerat represents him as highly revered on the
coast of Coromandel, where, according to him, "the Indians would not on
any account build a house without having placed on the ground an image
of this deity, which they sprinkle with oil and adorn every day with
flowers. They set up his image in all their temples, in the streets, in
the high roads, and in the open plains at the foot of some tree, so that
persons of all ranks may invoke him before they undertake any business,
and travellers worship him before they proceed on a journey." What is
true of the Coromandel coast, is true of most parts of India so far as
the worship of this deity is concerned.

"Ganesa is the Hindu god of Prudence and Policy. He is the reputed
eldest son of Siva and Pārvati (the 'Padma Purāna' alone declares that
he was the actual child of these deities), and is represented with an
elephant's head—an emblem of sagacity—and is frequently attended by, or
is riding upon, a rat. He has generally four hands, but sometimes six,
or eight, or only two." <span id="fr_285"></span>[\*](#fn_285.md) He is
always described as being very corpulent; and pictures or images of him
are seen over the doors of most shopkeepers. It is not easy to see why
Ganesa

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

has become so universally worshipped, as there are few legends in the
Purānas attesting his divine power.

The "Brahmāvaivarta Purāna" <span id="fr_286"></span>[\*](#fn_286.md) gives
the following account of his birth:—"Pārvati, after her marriage with
Siva, being without a child, and very desirous to obtain one, was
advised by her husband to perform the Panyākavrātā. This is the worship
of Vishnu, to be begun on the thirteenth day of the bright fortnight of
Māgha, and continued for a year, on every day of which flowers, fruits,
cakes, vessels, gems, gold, etc., are to be presented, and a thousand
Brāhmans fed; and the performer of the rite is to observe most carefully
a life of inward purity, and to fix the mind on Hari (Vishnu). Pārvati
having, with the aid of Sanat Kumāra, as directing priest, accomplished
the ceremony on the banks of the Ganges, returns after some interval, in
which she sees Krishna, first as a body of light, and afterwards as an
old Brāhman, come to her dwelling. The reward of her religious zeal
being delayed, she is plunged in grief, when a viewless voice tells her
to go to her apartment, where she will find a son who is the lord of
Goloka, or Krishna, that deity having assumed the semblance of her son
as a recompense for her devotions.

"In compliment to this occasion, all the gods came to congratulate Siva
and Pārvati, and were severally admitted to see the infant. Amidst the
splendid cohort was Sand, the planet Saturn, who, although anxious to
pay his homage to the child, kept his eyes stedfastly fixed on the
ground. Pārvati asking him the reason of this, he told her that, being
immersed in meditation upon Vishnu, he had disregarded the caresses of
his wife, and in resentment of his neglect, she had denounced upon him
the curse that whomsoever he gazed upon he should

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

destroy. To obviate the evil consequences of this imprecation, he
avoided looking any one in the face. Parvati, having heard his story,
paid no regard to it, but, considering that what must be, must be, gave
him

permission to look on her son. Sani, calling Dharma to witness his
having leave, took a peep at Ganesa, on which the child's head was
severed from his body, and flew away to the heaven of Krishna, where it
re-united with the substance of him of whom it formed a part.

"Durgā, taking the headless trunk in her arms, cast herself weeping on
the ground, and the gods thought it decent to follow her example, all
except Vishnu, who mounted Garuda, and flew off to the river
Pushpabhadra, where, finding an elephant asleep, he took off his head,
and, flying back with it, clapped it on to the body of Ganesa; hence the
body of that deity is crowned with its present uncouth capital. On the
restoration of Ganesa to life, valuable gifts were made to the gods and
Brāhmans by the parents, and by Pārvati's father, the personified
Himālaya. The unfortunate Sani was again anathematized, and, in
consequence of Pārvati's curse, has limped ever since.

"In another part of the same Purāna, further particulars are given
somewhat at variance with the above. Siva, offended with Aditya (the
sun), slew him, and although he restored him to life incurred the wrath
of the sage Kasyapa, who doomed his (Siva's) son to lose his head. The
elephant whose head was placed upon Ganesa's body was Indra's elephant,
which was decapitated because Indra threw over his neck the garland of
flowers which the sage Durvasas gave him, and the disrespect of which,
with the consequent degradation of Indra, is noticed in various Purānas,
although with different results. Indra was no loser of an elephant by

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

this transaction, as Vishnu, moved by the prayers of his wife, gave him
another in place of that which he took away.

"Ganesa has only one tusk, and hence is called Ekadanta. The reason of
this is as follows:—Parasurāma, who was a favourite disciple of Siva,
went to Kailasa to visit his master. On arriving at the inner apartment,
his entrance was opposed by Ganesa, as his father was asleep. Parasurāma
nevertheless urged his way, and, after a long dialogue, the two came to
blows. Ganesa had at first the advantage, seizing Parasurāma in his
trunk, and giving him a twirl that left him sick and senseless. On
recovering, Rāma threw his axe at Ganesa, who, recognizing it as his
father's weapon—Siva having given it to Parasurāma—received it with all
humility upon one of his tusks, which it immediately severed, and hence
Ganesa has but one tusk. Pārvati was highly incensed at this, and was
about to curse Rāma, when Krishna, of whom he was a worshipper, appeared
as a boy and appeased her indignation. Brahmā is said to have promised
that her son should be worshipped before the other gods. This result of
his contest with Rāma was in consequence of a curse pronounced upon him
by the sage Tulasi, with whom he had quarrelled."

We have quite a different account of the origin of Ganesa in the "Matsya
Purāna." <span id="fr_287"></span>[\*](#fn_287.md) When Pārvati was
bathing, she took the oil and ointments used at the bath, together with
the impurities that came from her body, and formed them into the figure
of a man, to which she gave life by sprinkling it with the water of the
Ganges. This figure had the head of the elephant. The "Siva Purāna"
relates that, after giving Ganesa life, Pārvati placed him at her door
to prevent intrusion

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

whilst she was bathing. On his refusal to allow Siva to enter, a
struggle ensued, in which that deity cut off Ganesa's head; but when
Pārvati showed her husband that it was by her orders that the door was
closed, and wept because of the loss of her son, Siva ordered the first
head that could be found to be brought to him; this happened to be an
elephant's, which he fitted to the headless trunk and resuscitated his
son.

In the "Vārāha Purāna" <span id="fr_288"></span>[\*](#fn_288.md) Ganesa is
said to have been produced by Siva alone. "The immortals and holy sages
observing that no difficulty occurred in accomplishing good or evil
deeds which they and others commenced, consulted together respecting the
means by which obstacles might be opposed to the commission of bad
actions, and repaired to Siva for counsel, to whom they said: 'O
Mahādeva! God of gods, three eyed, bearer of the trident, it is thou
alone who canst create a being capable of opposing obstacles to the
commission of improper acts.' Hearing these words, Siva looked at
Pārvati, and whilst thinking how he could effect the wishes of the gods,
from the splendour of his countenance there sprang into existence a
youth shedding radiance around, endowed with the qualities of Siva, and
evidently another Rudra, and captivating by his beauty the female
inhabitants of heaven.

"Umā seeing his beauty was excited with jealousy, and in her anger
pronounced this curse: 'Thou shalt not offend my sight with the form of
a beautiful youth; therefore assume an elephant's head and a large
belly, and thus shall all thy beauties vanish.' Siva then addressed his
son, saying, 'Thy name shall be Ganesa, and the son of Siva; thou shalt
be chief of the Vinayakas and Ganas; success and disappointment shall

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

spring from thee; and great shall be thine influence amongst the gods,
and in sacrifices and all affairs. Therefore shalt thou be worshipped
and invoked the first on all occasions, otherwise the object and prayers
of him who omits to do so shall fail.

"The origin and purpose of Ganesa's existence are more fully taught in
the Skanda. <span id="fr_289"></span>[\*](#fn_289.md) Siva addressing
Pārvati says, "During the twilight that intervened between the Dwarpara
and Kāli Yugas, women, barbarians, Sudras, and other workers of sin
obtained entrance to heaven by visiting the celebrated shrine of
Someswara (Somnāth). Sacrifices, ascetic practices, charitable gifts,
and all the other prescribed ordinances ceased, and men thronged only to
the temple of Siva. Hence old and young, those skilled in the Vedas and
those ignorant of them, and even women and Sudras, ascended to heaven,
until at length it became crowded to excess. Then Indra and the gods,
afflicted because thus overcome by men, sought the protection of Siva,
and thus addressed him: 'O Sankara! by thy favour heaven is crowded with
men, and we are nearly expelled from it. These mortals wander wherever
they please, exclaiming, "1 am the greatest, I am the greatest; " and
Dharmarāja (Yama), beholding the register of their good and evil deeds,
is lost in astonishment. The seven hells were intended for their
reception; but, having visited thy shrine, their sins have been
remitted, and they have attained to a most excellent future!' Siva
replied, Such was my promise to Soma, nor can it be infringed; all men,
therefore, who visit the temple of Someswara must ascend to heaven; but
supplicate Pārvati, and she will contrive some means for extricating you
from this distress.'

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

"The gods then invoked Pārvati in laudatory strains: 'Praise be to thee,
O supreme of goddesses! Supporter of the universe, praise be to thee,
who createst and destroyest! Grant us thy aid, and save us from this
distress!' Having heard the prayer of Indra and the gods, thou, O
goddess! wert moved with compassion; and gently rubbing thy body, there
was produced a wondrous being with four arms and an elephant's head, and
then thou didst thus address the gods: 'Desirous of your advantage, have
I created this being, who will occasion obstacles to men, and, deluding
them, will deprive them of the wish to visit Somnāth, and thus shall
they fall into hell.' Hearing this, the gods returned to their homes
delighted.

"The Elephant-faced then, addressing Devi, said, 'Command, O lovely
goddess! what shall I now do?' Thou didst reply, 'Oppose obstacles to
men's visiting Somnāth, and entice them to give up such a purpose by the
allurements of wives, children, possessions, and wealth. But from those
who propitiate thee with the following hymn, do thou remove all
obstacles, and enable them to obtain the favour of Siva, by worshipping
his shrine at Somnāth:—"Om, I praise thee, O lord of difficulties! The
beloved spouse of Siddhi (knowledge) and Buddhi (understanding);
Ganapati, invincible, and the giver of victory; the opposer of obstacles
to the success of men who do not worship thee! I praise thee, O Ganesa!
The dreadful son of Umā, but firm and easily propitiated! O Vinayaka! I
praise thee! O elephant-faced, who didst formerly protect the gods, and
accomplish their wishes, I praise thee!" Thus,' continued Pārvati, shalt
thou be praised and worshipped.' And whoever previously invokes the god
Vinayaka, no difficulties shall impede the attainment of his purposed

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

object, and a most beneficial result shall he derive from sacrifices,
pilgrimages, and all other devotional acts."

The following extract from the "Ganapati Upanishad" <span
id="fr_290"></span>[\*](#fn_290.md) is a specimen of the addresses to
Ganesa used by the Ganapatyas: <span id="fr_291"></span>[†](#fn_291.md)
"Praise to thee, O Ganesa! Thou art manifestly the truth; thou art
undoubtedly the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer, the Supreme Brahma,
the eternal Spirit. I speak what is right and true; preserve me
therefore, when speaking, listening, giving, possessing, teaching,
learning; continually protect me everywhere. By thee was this universe
manifested; for thou art earth, water, fire, air and ether. Thou art
Brahmā, Vishnu, and Rudra. We acknowledge thy divinity, O Ekadanta! and
meditate on thy countenance; enlighten, therefore, our understanding. He
who continually meditates upon thy divine form, conceiving it to be with
one tooth, four hands, bearing a rat on thy banner, of a red hue, with a
large belly, anointed with red perfumes, arrayed in red garments,
worshipped with offerings of red flowers, abounding in compassion, the
cause of this universe, imperishable, unproduced and unaffected by
creation, becomes the most excellent of Yogis. Praise, therefore, be to
thee, O Ganapati. Whoever meditates upon this figure of the 'Atharva
Siras' (the name of the Upanishad of which the Ganapati forms a part)
never will be impeded by difficulties, will be liberated from the five
great sins, and all lesser ones; and will acquire riches, the objects of
his desires, virtue and final beatitude."

Ganesa is said to have written the Mahābhārata at Vyāsa's dictation. In
the Ādiparva of that book it is declared that when the sage was about to
compose it

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahmā advised him
to ask Ganesa to become his amanuensis. Vyāsa at first gave a few
difficult sentences to puzzle him, which to this day the composer only
and his disciple Suka have been able to understand. As Ganesa paused to
think out the meaning of what he was writing, Vyāsa composed other
difficult passages.

In recent times there has been a supposed incarnation of Ganesa, whose
descendant and representative was visited by Captain E. Moor during the
present century. The following is the account of his visit: <span
id="fr_292"></span>[\*](#fn_292.md)—"Muraba Goseyn was a Brāhman of Poona
who by abstinence, mortification, and prayer, merited above others the
favourable regards of the Almighty. Ganapati accordingly vouchsafed to
appear to him at Chinchoor in a vision by night; desired him to arise
and bathe; and, whilst in the act of ablution, to seize and hold sacred
to the Godhead the first tangible substance that his hand encountered.
The god covenanted that a portion of his Holy Spirit should pervade the
person thus favoured, and he continued as far as the seventh generation
to his seed, who were to become successively hereditary guardians of
this sacred substance, which proved to be a stone, in which the god was
understood as mystically typified. This type is duly reverenced,
carefully preserved, and has ever been the constant companion of the
sanctified person inheriting with it the divine patrimony. This
annunciation happened about A.D. 1640; and at the time Captain Moor
visited the place, the sixth descendant was the representative of the
Deity.

"It does not now appear what was the precise extent of the divine energy
originally conceded, but it is inferred to have been a limited power of
working miracles, such as healing sickness, answering the prayers

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

of pious suppliants, and the faculty of foretelling future events. These
gifts were enjoyed in a more extensive degree by the earlier
representatives of the god; but the person whom Moor saw professed to
have performed several miracles. The third in descent is reported to
have performed a wonderful work. It was in his time that the Moghul army
of Hyderabad so successfully invaded the Mahratta country. After
plundering and burning Poona, a party proceeded to Chinchoor, the
residence of this Deity, to lay it under contribution. To this the Deo
refused to submit, confiding in the divine influence wherewith he was
invested. The Mussulmans derided such superstition, and with a view of
rendering it ridiculous offered to send a Nuzur (present) to the Deo.
The offer was accepted, the Deo betook himself to prayers, and the
insulting bigots deputed certain persons to see the result, as
apparently a decorous and appropriate present was given. It consisted,
however, of cow's flesh, an abomination in the eyes of a Hindu. When the
trays were uncovered, they were greatly astonished to find that, instead
of the cow's flesh, the trays were filled with the finest and most
sacred flowers of the Hindus. The Mussulmans, seeing this, recognized
the finger of God in the transaction, and so struck were they with the
reality of the miracle that a valuable grant of land was made to the
Deo, which his temple enjoys to this day."

The Deo eats, sleeps, marries, and lives the life of an ordinary mortal;
and though he is regarded as a fool in worldly matters, he is worshipped
as a god. On special occasions his actions and movements are most
carefully watched, as they are transient manifestations of the divine
will, and are regarded as prophetic. Thus, on a particular night of the
year, should he remain in

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

peaceful sleep, national repose is predicted; should his slumbers or his
waking moments be disturbed, national calamities are expected. If he
start wildly from his seat, seize a sword, or make any warlike movement,
war may be looked for."

##### 2. KARTIKEYA.

Kartikeya, the god of war, and generalissimo of the armies of the gods,
though called the younger son of

<span id="img_33400"></span> <span align="CENTER">
[![KARTIKEYA.](tn/33400.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/33400.jpg.md)  
KARTIKEYA.  
</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Siva and Parvati,
according to most of the Puranic legends, is their son only in the sense
that they formed

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

him. Brahmā arranged for his birth in answer to the prayers of the gods
for a competent leader of their forces. The Rāmāyana <span
id="fr_293"></span>[\*](#fn_293.md) says: "While Siva, the lord of the
gods, was performing austerities, the other deities went to Brahmā and
asked for a general in the room of Mahādeva, who, it seems, had formerly
acted in that capacity. 'He,' said they, 'whom thou didst formerly give
as a leader of our armies (Mahādeva), is now performing great
austerities, along with Umā.' Brahmā says that in consequence of the
curse of Umā no son could be born of any wives of the gods, but that
Agni should have a son by the river Gangā, who should be their general."

In the following extract from the Mahābhārata <span
id="fr_294"></span>[†](#fn_294.md) is an explanation of the statement in
the preceding paragraph that Agni was to be the father of this god.
Kartikeya has just been installed as general, when, "the god whose
banner is a bull (Siva), arriving with his goddess, paid him honour,
well pleased. Brāhmans called Agni Rudra, consequently he (Kartikeya) is
the son of Rudra. Having seen him thus honoured by Rudra, all the
deities consequently call him, who is the most excellent of the gifted,
the son of Rudra. For this child was produced by Rudra when he entered
into fire. Skanda (Kartikeya), that most eminent deity, being born of
Agni, \[who was\] Rudra, and from Svāhā (Umā) \[and\] the six wives \[of
the Rishis\], was the son of Rudra."

This quotation will be more intelligible after reading what precedes it:
"Indra being distressed at the defeat of the armies of the gods by the
Dānavas, is meditating on this subject, when he hears the cry of a
female calling for help, and asking for a husband to protect her. Indra
sees that she has been seized by the demon Kesin, with

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

whom he remonstrates; but the demon hurls his club at Indra, who,
however, splits it with his thunderbolt. Kesin is disabled in the next
stage of the combat, and goes off. Indra then finds out from the female
that her name is Devasenā (army of the gods), that she has a sister
named Daityasenā (army of the daityas), and that they are both daughters
of Prajāpati. She wishes Indra to find her a proper husband, who shall
be able to overcome the enemies of the gods. Indra takes Devasenā with
him to Brahmā, and desires him to provide her with a martial husband;
and Brahmā promises that a helpmate of that description shall be born.
It happened that Vasishtha and other Rishis had been offering a
sacrifice, whither the gods, headed by Indra, proceeded to drink the
Soma juice. Agni, too, being invoked, descended from the region of the
sun, entered into the fire, received the oblations of the Rishis, and
presented them to the gods.

"Issuing forth \[from the fire\], he beheld the wives of these great
\[Rishis\] reclining in their own hermitages, and sweetly sleeping,
resembling golden altars, pure as beams of the moon, like to flames of
fire, all wonderful as stars. Perceiving that his senses became
agitated, beholding the wives of the Rishis, Agni was overcome with
desire. Again and again he said, 'It is not proper that I should be thus
agitated; they are not in love with me. Entering into the domestic fire,
I shall gaze upon them close at hand.' Entering the domestic fire,
touching, as it were, with his flames, all of them, and beholding them,
he was delighted. Dwelling thus there for a long time, fixing his
attention on these beautiful women, and enamoured of them, Agni was
overcome.

"Agni failing to obtain the Brāhmans' wives, resolved to abandon his
corporeal form, and went into the forest.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then Svāhā, the
daughter of Daksha, first fell in love with him. This amorous and
blameless goddess for a long time sought for his weak point, but could
not find any. But being aware that he had gone into the wood, and that
he was really disturbed by desire, the amorous goddess thus reflected:
'I, who am distressed with love, will take the forms of the seven
Rishis' wives, and will court the affection of Agni. By doing so he will
be pleased, and I shall obtain my desire.' Assuming first the form of
Siva, the wife of Angiras, the handsome goddess went to Agni, and thus
addressed him: 'Agni, thou oughtest to love me, who am disturbed with
love for thee; if thou wilt not do so, look upon me as dead. Agni, I,
Siva, the wife of Angiras, have come, sent by virtuous women.' Agni
replied: 'How dost thou, and how do the other beloved wives of the seven
Rishis, know that I am distressed with love?'"

Agni was not able to resist the temptation. After the interview, lest
the wives of the Rishis should be blamed for their misconduct if she
happened to be seen in their form, she assumed the figure of Garuda, the
bird of Vishnu, and unnoticed, as she thought, flew from the forest. She
visited Agni a second time, as the wife of another Rishi, and so on
until she had paid six visits. The germs obtained from Agni she
deposited in a golden reservoir, which, "being worshipped by the Rishis,
generated a son. Kumāra (Kartikeya) was born with six heads, a double
number of ears, twelve eyes, arms, and feet, one neck and one belly.

"Kartikeya marries Devasenā. The six Rishis’ wives, his mothers,
afterwards come to him, complaining that they had been abandoned by
their husbands, and degraded from their former positions, and asking him
to secure their admission into paradise (Swarga). When

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Skanda had done
what was gratifying to his mothers, Svāhā said to him, 'Thou art my
genuine son. I desire the love difficult to obtain which thou givest.'
Skanda then asked her, 'What love dost thou desire?' Svāhā replied, 'I
am the beloved daughter of Daksha, by name Svāhā. From my childhood I
have been enamoured of Agni; but, my son, Agni does not thoroughly know
me, who am enamoured of him.' Skanda replied, 'Whatever oblation of
Brāhmans is introduced by hymns, they shall always, goddess, lift and
throw it into the fire, saying Svāhā (happiness). Thus, O beautiful
goddess, Agni shall dwell with thee continually." Then Brahmā Prajāpati
said to Skanda, Go to thy *father Mahādeva*, the vexer of Tripura. Thou,
unconquered, hast been produced for the good of all worlds by Rudra, who
had entered into Agni, and Umā, who had entered into Svāhā.'"

The allusion to Rudra's entering into Agni is explained in the Rāmāyana.
The gods, fearing that the descendants of such a pair as Siva and
Pārvati would be too dreadful to live with, entreated those deities not
to have offspring. Siva consented, but Umā, being angry, declared that
as she could not have children the other goddesses should suffer similar
deprivation. Unfortunately, the gods came too late to prevent the
production of Kartikeya; the germ from which he was born having been
received by the earth. Agni and Vāyu entered it, and deposited it with
Gangā, the sister of Umā, and thus this deity was produced.

The "Siva Purāna" <span id="fr_295"></span>[\*](#fn_295.md) gives a
different account of his origin, and teaches that he was produced to
effect the destruction of Tārika. This demon, who was King of Tripura,
was " exceedingly ambitious and oppressive.

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

He forced Brahmā, by his penance and austerities, to promise him any
boon that he should demand. Among his austerities he went through the
following series, each of the eleven specific mortifications continuing
100 years:—1. He stood on one foot, holding the other and both hands up
towards heaven, with his eyes fixed on the sun. 2. He stood on one great
toe. 3. He took only water as sustenance. 4. He lived similarly on air.
5. He remained in water. 6. He was buried in the earth, but continued as
under the last infliction, in incessant adoration. 7. The same in fire.
8. He stood on his head. 9. He hung on a tree by his hands. 10. He bore
the weight of his body on one hand. 11. He hung on a tree with his head
downwards. <span id="fr_296"></span>[\*](#fn_296.md)

"Such merit was irresistible, and Indra and a host of demi-gods, alarmed
lest their sovereignty should be usurped through the potency of this
penance, resorted to Brahmā for consolation. Brahmā, however, said that,
although he could not resist such austerities, he would, after rewarding
them by granting the boon demanded, devise a method of rendering it
ultimately inoffensive to them.

"The demand by Tārika was that he should be unrivalled in strength, and
that no hand should slay him but that of a son of Mahādeva. He now
became so arrogant that Indra was forced to yield to him the white
eight-headed horse Ukhisrava; Kuvera gave up his thousand sea-horses;
the Rishis were compelled to resign the cow Kāmdhenu, that yielded
everything that could be wished. The Sun in dread gave no heat, and the
Moon in terror remained always at full. The Winds

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

blew as he dictated, and, in short, he usurped the entire management of
the universe.

"Nārada prophesied the marriage whence should arise the deliverer of the
world; but at first Mahādeva could not be influenced with the passion of
love. Indra persuaded Kama to lie in ambush, and contrived that Pārvati
should be seen by Siva while engaged in the amiable and graceful act of
gathering flowers, wherewith to decorate his image. Kāma, accompanied by
his wife Rati (Desire), and his bosom friend Vasantu (the Spring), took
his aim, and launched an arrow at Mahādeva, who, enraged at the attempt
(to interrupt his devotion), reduced Kāma to ashes by a beam of fire
that issued from his third eye. At length, however, by ardent devotion
and austerities, Pārvati propitiated Siva, and the deity consented to
espouse his persevering devotee."

For some time after their marriage, as there was no child born to them,
the distressed and disappointed deities who had been anxiously expecting
a deliverer, renewed their lamentations and complaints.

"Agni arrived in the presence of Mahādeva, having been deputed to
express the desires of the other gods, that he would provide them with a
son, who should destroy Tārika. Siva had just left his wife, and Agni,
assuming the form of a dove, received from Mahādeva the germ from which
Kartikeya arose. Unable to carry it further, he let it fall into the
Ganges, on the banks of which river arose a boy, beautiful as the moon,
and bright as the sun, who was called Agnibhuva (produced from Agni),
Skanda, Kartikeya, etc.

"It happened that six daughters (the Pleiades) of as many Rajas, coming
to bathe, saw the boy, and each called him her son; and, offering the
breast, the child assumed to himself six mouths, and received nurture

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

from each; whence he is called Sasthimātriya (having six mothers). But
in fact the child had no mother, for he came from his father alone. In
course of time a conflict ensued between Kartikeya and Tārika, in which
the demon was slain."

A story is told showing how Kartikeya was outwitted by his brother
Ganesa. As the two brothers fell in love with two ladies named Siddhi
and Buddhi, it was agreed that whoever first travelled round the world
should have them. Ganesa proved by his logical talents and aptness at
quotation that he had done this, and obtained the prize long before his
brother returned from his weary pilgrimage, to the disquiet of both
families when Ganesa's sophistry was discovered.

We have still another account <span id="fr_297"></span>[\*](#fn_297.md) of
the origin of Kartikeya: "Siva emitted sparks of fire from his eyes,
which, being thrown into the lake Saravana, became six infants, who were
nursed by the wives of the Rishis, who are seen in the sky as the
Pleiades. When Pārvati saw these children, she was transported with
their beauty, and embraced all of them together so forcibly that their
six bodies became one; while their six heads and twelve arms remained."

Kartikeya is better known in South India under the name of Subramanya.
The "Skanda Purāna" gives a full account of his war with Sura, and
relates how he was sent by his father to interrupt Daksha's sacrifice;
and how, at the instigation of the latter, he was delayed on his journey
by beautiful damsels, who entertained him with dance and song. Hence it
is the practice for dancing girls, who are attached to the pagodas, to
be betrothed and married to him; and, though allowed to prostitute
themselves, cannot marry any one.
