### CHAPTER VI.

#### SIVA.

<span class="smallcaps">Siva</span> is the third person of the Hindu
Triad. As Brahmā was Creator, Vishnu Preserver, in order to

</span>

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

complete the system, as all things are subject to decay, a Destroyer was
necessary; and destruction is regarded as the peculiar work of Siva.
This seems scarcely in harmony with the form by which he is usually
represented. It must be remembered, however, that, according to the
teaching of Hinduism, death is not death in the sense of passing into
non-existence, but simply a change into a new form of life. He who
destroys, therefore, causes beings to assume new phases of existence—the
Destroyer is really a re-Creator; hence the name Siva, the Bright or
Happy One, is given to him, which would not have been the case had he
been regarded as the destroyer in the ordinary meaning of that term.

In the later Hinduism, as taught in the Epics and Purānas, Siva plays a
most important part, several books having been written for the purpose
of celebrating his praise; yet his name as that of a god does not occur
in the Vedas. In order, therefore, to gain greater reverence for him
amongst men, he is declared to be the Rudra of the Vedras. In some
passages in the Vedras, Rudra is identified with Agni; yet "the
distinctive epithets applied to him in the Rig-Veda appear sufficiently
to prove that he was generally discriminated from Agni by his early
worshippers." <span id="fr_234"></span>[\*](#fn_234.md)

Between the texts from the Brāhmanas relative to Rudra, and the earliest
descriptions of the same deity which we discover in the Epic poems, a
wide chasm intervenes, which, as far as I am aware, no genuine ancient
materials exist for bridging over. The Rudra of the Mahābhārata is not
indeed very different in his general character from the god of the same
name who is portrayed in the Satarudriya, but in the later literature
his importance is immensely increased, his attributes are

more clearly defined, and the conceptions entertained of his person are
rendered more distinct by the addition of various additional features
and illustrated by numerous legends. Instead of remaining a subordinate
deity, as he was in the Vedic Age, Rudra has thrown Agni, Vāyu, Surya,
Mitra, and Varuna completely into the shade; and although Indra still
occupies a prominent place in the Epic legends, he bas sunk down into a
subordinate position, and is quite unable to compete in power and
dignity with Rudra, who, together with Vishnu, now engrosses the almost
exclusive worship of the Brāhmanical world." <span
id="fr_235"></span>[\*](#fn_235.md)

In the following texts from the Vedas, <span
id="fr_236"></span>[†](#fn_236.md) referring to Rudra, will be seen the
germs of some of the legends found in the later books concerning
Siva:—"What can we utter to Rudra, the intelligent, the strong, the most
bountiful, which shall be most pleasant to his heart, that so Aditi may
bring Rudra's healing to our cattle, and men, and kine, and children? We
seek from Rudra, the lord of songs, the lord of sacrifices, who
possesses healing remedies, his auspicious favour; from him who is
brilliant as the sun, who shines like gold, who is the best and most
bountiful of the gods." "We invoke with obeisance the ruddy boar of the
sky, with spirally braided hair, a brilliant form." "Far be from us thy
cow-slaying and man-slaying weapon." In the same hymn Rudra is called
the father of the Maruts or Storm-gods; to explain which the commentator
introduces a legend of a later date which is found in the account of the
Maruts. <span id="fr_237"></span>[‡](#fn_237.md) In another hymn Rudra is
thus addressed: "Thou fitly holdest arrows and a bow; fitly thou
\[wearest\] a glorious necklace of every form \[of beauty\]."

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The name Siva may
have been connected with Rudra from a verse in the Vajasaneyi recension
of the white "Yajur Veda," wherein Rudra is thus addressed: "Thou art
gracious (Siva) by name." <span id="fr_238"></span>[\*](#fn_238.md) Other
epithets, which are afterwards extended into legends, are seen in a
prayer in the same Veda: "Shine upon us, dweller in the mountain, with
that blessed body of thine which is auspicious." <span
id="fr_239"></span>[†](#fn_239.md) " May he who glides away, blue-necked
and red-coloured, be gracious unto us." "Reverence to the blue-necked,
to the thousand-eyed, to the bountiful, and to the lord of spirits, and
to the lord of thieves."

In the following account of Rudra's birth, he is identified with
Agni:—"The lord of beings was a householder, and Ushas (The Dawn) was
his wife. A boy was born (to them) in a year. The boy wept. Prajāpati
said to him, 'Boy, why dost thou weep, since thou hast been born after
toil and austerity?" The boy said, 'My evil has not been taken away, and
a name has not been given to me. Give me a name.' Prajāpati said, 'Thou
art Rudra.' Inasmuch as he gave him that name, Agni became his form, for
Rudra is Agni. He was Rudra because he wept (from *rud*, to
weep)." <span id="fr_240"></span>[‡](#fn_240.md) This account of the birth
of Rudra agrees with that of the Vishnu and Mārkandeya Purānas, and to
some extent with that of others.

It is impossible to give a connected account of the life of this deity.
His career was not clearly defined like an Avatāra of Vishnu, of which
we have a history of his birth, life, and death. Though he often
appeared on earth in human form, and frequently dwelt at his favourite
city, Benares, his heavenly home was at Kailāsa on the Himalayas. All
that can be done is to

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

give a few out of the many legends found in the sacred books in which
his character and works are described. From these we may learn something
of the idea of the age in which they were written respecting Siva.

Rudra, according to the Rāmāyana, married Umā, the daughter of Daksha,
who reappears in various stages of the life of Siva as Pārvati, Durgā,
Kāli, etc. Fearing that the children of such parents would be dangerous
to live with, the gods entreated Siva and Umā to live a life of
chastity: to this they consented. The request, however, came too late to
prevent the birth of Kartikeya. Umā declared that the wives of the other
gods should also be childless. Rudra took a prominent position at the
churning of the ocean; he drank the poison, as nectar, that was produced
before the amrita, which caused his neck to become dark-coloured—hence
one of his names is Nilkanta, "the blue-necked."

As Umā was sitting with her husband in their home on Mount Kailasa,
seeing the gods driving by in their chariots, she was told that they
were proceeding, at her father's invitation, to take part in a great
sacrifice he was about to make. As Siva had offended him, Daksha had not
invited him. The "Bhāgavata Purāna" <span
id="fr_241"></span>[\*](#fn_241.md) gives the cause of this slight upon
Siva: "On one occasion the gods and Rishis were assembled at a sacrifice
celebrated by the Prajāpatis. On Daksha's entrance, all rose to salute
him excepting his father Brahmā and Mahādeva (Siva). Daksha, after
making his obeisance to Brahmā, sat down by his command, but was
offended at the treatment he received from Siva. Seeing him previously
seated, Daksha did not brook this want of respect; but looking at him
obliquely with his eyes, as if consuming him, thus spake: 'Hear me, ye
Brāhman

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rishis, with the
gods and the Agnis, while I, neither from ignorance nor passion,
describe what is the practice of virtuous persons. But this shameless
being (Siva) detracts from the reputation of the guardians of the
world—he by whom, stubborn as he is, the course pursued by the good is
transgressed. He assumed the position of my disciple, inasmuch as, like
a virtuous person, in the face of Brāhmans and of fire, he took the hand
of my daughter who resembled Savitri. This monkey-eyed \[god\], after
having taken the hand of \[my\] fawn-eyed \[daughter\], has not even by
word shown suitable respect to me, whom he ought to have risen and
saluted. Though unwilling, I yet gave my daughter to this impure and
proud abolisher of rites and demolisher of barriers, like the word of a
Veda to a Sudra. He roams about in dreadful cemeteries, attended by
hosts of ghosts and sprites, like a madman, naked, with dishevelled
hair, wearing a garland of dead men's \[skulls\] and ornaments of human
bones, pretending to be Siva (auspicious), but in reality Asiva
(inauspicious), insane, beloved by the insane, the lord of Bhutas
(spirits), beings whose nature is essentially darkness. To this
wicked-hearted lord of the infuriate, whose purity has perished, I have,
alas! given my virtuous daughter, at the instigation of Brahmā.' Having
thus reviled Siva, who did not oppose him, Daksha, having touched water,
incensed, began to curse him: 'Let this Bhava (Siva), lowest of the
gods, never at the worship of the gods receive any portion along with
the gods Indra, Upendra (Vishnu), and others.'

"Daksha then left the assembly. After his departure a follower of
Mahādeva pronounced a curse upon him, and the Brāhmans who sympathized
with him: 'Let Daksha, brutal, be excessively devoted to women, and

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

have speedily the head of a goat. Let this stupid being continue to
exist in this world in ceremonial ignorance!' Upon this, Bhrigu (a
brother of Daksha, and a Rishi) launched a counter-curse upon the
followers of Siva: 'Let those who practise the rites of Bhava be
heretics and opponents of the true scriptures. Having lost their purity,
deluded in understanding, wearing matted hair and ashes and bones, let
them undergo the initiation of Siva, in which spirituous liquors are the
deity.' Hearing this imprecation, Siva and his followers left the
assembly, while Daksha and the other Prajāpatis <span
id="fr_242"></span>[\*](#fn_242.md) celebrated for a thousand years the
sacrifice in which Vishnu was the object of veneration."

The enmity thus commenced between Siva and Daksha continued; and in
consequence, at the great sacrifice made when his father-in-law was
appointed chief of the Prajāpatis, Siva was not invited. Umā was greatly
grieved, as her husband told her, "The former practice of the gods has
been that in all sacrifices no portion should be divided to me. By
custom, established by the earliest arrangement, the gods lawfully allot
me no share in the sacrifice." According to the Mahābhārata, he then
sets off for the assembly and with his attendants puts an end to the
sacrifice, which, taking the form of a deer, is followed by Siva into
the sky. A drop of perspiration falls from his forehead, from which a
fire proceeds, out of which issues a dreadful being Jvara (Fever), which
burns up the other things prepared for the sacrifice, and even puts to
flight the gods. Brahmā, now appears to Siva, promises that the gods
shall henceforth give him a share in the sacrifices, and proposes that
Jvara shall be allowed to range over the earth.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

The Bhāgavata <span id="fr_243"></span>[\*](#fn_243.md) gives a more
lengthy and somewhat different account of the termination of Daksha's
ceremony. Sati (Umā) was most anxious to attend it. Though her husband
tries to dissuade her, she "disregards his warning and goes; but, being
slighted by her father, reproaches him for his hostility to her husband,
and threatens to abandon her corporeal frame by which she was connected
with her parent. She then voluntarily gives up the ghost. Seeing this,
Siva's attendants, who had followed, rush on Daksha to slay him." This,
however, is prevented, and Siva's followers are put to flight. When Siva
heard of his wife's death, he was greatly angered, and "from a lock of
his hair a gigantic demon arose (named Virabhadra), whom he commanded to
destroy Daksha and his sacrifice." This was accomplished. He plucked out
Bhrigu's beard, tore out Bhaga's eyes, knocked out Pushan's teeth, and
cut off Daksha's head. In their distress, the gods are advised to
propitiate Siva. For this purpose they resort to Kailāsa, where they see
Siva "carrying the linga desired by devotees, ashes, a staff, a tuft of
hair, an antelope's skin, and a digit of the moon, his body shining like
an evening cloud." Siva in part relents, and allows Daksha to have a
goat's head: the sacrifice is completed, and Vishnu gives an address in
which he shows that he is the supreme deity, and that the troubles of
his worshippers arise from imagining themselves to be different from
him. Daksha himself worships Siva, and Umā, who had voluntarily given up
herself to the flames, and thus become a *Sati*, <span
id="fr_244"></span>[†](#fn_244.md)

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

was re-born as Pārvati, being then the daughter of Himavat, the god of
the Himālayas and Menā.

Siva adopted the garb, and lived the life of an ascetic. Though
generally worshipped under the form of the linga, he "is represented in
human form, living in the Himālayas along with Pārvati, sometimes in the
act of trampling on or destroying demons, wearing round his black neck a
serpent, and a necklace of skulls, and furnished with a whole apparatus
of external emblems, such as a white bull on which he rides, a trident,
tiger's skin, elephant's skin, rattle, noose, etc. He has three eyes,
one being in his forehead, in allusion either to the three Vedas, or
time past, present and future. He has a crescent on his forehead, the
moon having been given to him as his share of the products of the
churning of the ocean. Again, Mahādeva, or the great deity Siva, is
sometimes connected with humanity in another personification very
different from that just noted, viz. that of an austere ascetic, with
matted hair, living in a forest and teaching men by his own example,
first, the power to be obtained by penance (tapas), mortification of the
body and suppression of the passions; and, secondly, the great virtue of
abstract meditation, as leading to the loftiest spiritual knowledge, and
ultimately to union, or actual identification with the great spirit of
the universe." <span id="fr_245"></span>[\*](#fn_245.md)

The following legend from the "Vāmana Purāna," <span
id="fr_246"></span>[†](#fn_246.md) describes the ordinary life of Siva as
an ascetic. Devi (Pārvati), oppressed with violent heat, thus addressed
her lord: "O Isha! the heat increases in violence; hast thou no house to
which we might repair, and there abide, protected from the wind, the
heat, the cold?"

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sankara replied:
"I am, O lovely one, without a shelter, a constant wanderer in forests."
Having thus spoken, Sankara with Sati remained during the hot season
under the shade of trees, and when it was passed, the rainy season with
its dark clouds succeeded. On beholding which, Sati said to Siva,
"Heart-agitating winds do blow, O Maheshwara, and rushing torrents roar;
let me entreat thee to build a house on Kailāsa, where I may abide with
thee in comfort." Siva replied, "O my beloved, I have no riches for the
erection of a house, nor am I possessor of aught else than an elephant's
skin for a garment, and serpents for my ornaments." The soul of Siva,
having heard these harsh words, seemingly true, but devoid of truth, was
alarmed, and looking on the ground with bashfulness and anger said,
"Then say, O Sambhu, how can we pass in comfort the rainy season under
the shade of trees?" Siva replied, "With our bodies covered with a
cloud, O lovely one, shall the rainy season pass without any rain
falling on thy tender frame." Having thus spoken, Siva stopped a cloud,
and with the daughter of Daksha, fixed his abode within it, and hence
has he since been celebrated in heaven under the name of Jimula-Kitu (he
whose banner is a cloud). When the rains were over, they took up their
abode in Mount Mandara.

The home life of Siva and his spouse does not appear to have been of the
happiest. As they could each bestow gifts upon their worshippers, it
sometimes happened that the one wanted to bless those whom the other
wished to curse. In the Rāmāyana and Mahābhārata <span
id="fr_247"></span>[\*](#fn_247.md) is an account of a dispute between them
in connection with the struggle between Rāma and Rāvana. In the earlier
part of the contest, Rāma being unable

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

to overthrow his enemy because of the assistance afforded him by Siva,
the gods whom Rāvana had oppressed went, with Rāma at their head, to ask
him to withdraw his help. Siva consented to accompany them on the
seventh day of the conflict to witness the destruction of their foe.
Durgā (Pārvati) severely reproached her husband, asking how he could
witness the destruction of his own worshipper, a worshipper who had
stood praying to him in the most sultry weather surrounded by four
fires; who had continued his devotions in the chilling cold, standing in
water; and had persevered in his applications, standing on his head,
amid torrents of rain. She then poured forth a torrent of abuse, calling
him a withered old man, who smoked intoxicating herbs, lived in
cemeteries and covered himself with ashes, and asked if he thought she
would accompany him on such an errand. Siva now gets angry, and reminds
his wife that she was only a woman and therefore could know nothing; and
further that she does not act like a woman, because she too wandered
about from place to place, engaged in war, was a drunkard, spent her
time in the company of degraded beings, killed giants, drank their blood
and hung their skulls around her neck. Durgā became so enraged at these
reproaches, that the gods were frightened. They entreated Rāma to join
them in supplication to her, or Rāvana would never be destroyed. He did
so; she then became propitious and consented to the destruction of the
demon. Durgā is represented in the Sivopākhyana as being exceedingly
jealous because her husband, in his begging excursions, visited the
quarters of the town inhabited by women of ill-fame, and in the Rāmāyana
is an account of a terrible quarrel between them because Parasurāma beat
her sons Kartikeya and Ganesa.

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

In the "Vāmana Purāna" <span id="fr_248"></span>[\*](#fn_248.md) is a
legend explaining why Siva adopted the dress and habits of a religious
mendicant. Formerly, when all things had been destroyed, and naught
remained but one vast ocean, that lord who is incomprehensible (Brahmā)
reposed in slumber for a thousand years. When the night had passed,
desirous of creating the three worlds, the skilled in the Vedas,
investing himself with the quality of impurity, assumed a corporeal form
with five heads (Brahmā). Then also was produced from the quality of
darkness another form with three eyes, and twisted locks, and bearing a
rosary and a trident. Brahmā next created Ahankara (consciousness of
individual existence), which immediately pervaded the nature of both
gods; and under its influence Rudra said to Brahmā, "Say, O lord? how
earnest thou hither, and by whom wert thou created?" Brahmā asks in
return, "And where have you come from?" The result is a terrible
quarrel, in which Siva, inflamed with anger, cut off the fifth head of
Brahmā, which had uttered the boastful words. But when Siva tried to
throw the head to the ground it would not fall, but remained in his
hand. Brahmā then created a giant to slay Siva in his weakened state,
which was caused by the sin of injuring Brahmā, the father of Brāhmans.
To escape from him Siva fled to Benares. The peculiar sanctity of
Benares arises from the fact that it was there Siva became absolved from
his great sin, and was freed from the dissevered head of Brahmā, which,
as a penance, he was doomed to carry with him wherever he went. It was
his attempts to get free from the sin of Brāhmanicide that made Siva a
wandering mendicant.

The ordinary name by which Siva is known is

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mahādeva, the
great god; the origin of this is taught in the Mahābhārata. <span
id="fr_249"></span>[\*](#fn_249.md) The asuras had a boon bestowed by
Brahmā, that they should possess three castles which could be
"destructible only by the deity who was able to overthrow them by a
single arrow." Owing to this defence, they became hateful to the other
gods, who, in their distress, went to Brahmā, and he again conducts them
to Mahādeva. Siva tells them that he alone cannot destroy these castles,
but that with the aid of half his strength, they themselves would be
able to accomplish this. They answered that as they could not sustain
half his strength, they proposed that he should undertake the work aided
by half their strength. Mahādeva consented to this, and thus became
stronger than all the gods, and was thenceforward called Mahādeva.
Notwithstanding this, in the account of Parasurāma a legend is given in
which Vishnu's superiority to Siva is shown; whilst in the Purānas
devoted to Siva's praise it is distinctly affirmed that Brahmā and
Vishnu are inferior to him.

The unity of the various deities is taught in the following
legend. <span id="fr_250"></span>[†](#fn_250.md) As Lakshmi and Durgā were
sitting together in the presence of Siva, Lakshmi contended that her
husband (Vishnu) was greater than Siva, because Siva had worshipped him.
As they were conversing, Vishnu himself appeared, and, in order to
convince his wife that he and Siva were equal, entered his body, and
they became one. Another form of this story is found in the "Skanda
Purāna." <span id="fr_251"></span>[‡](#fn_251.md) Siva asked Vishnu on one
occasion to assume the form of a beautiful woman, such as he did at the
churning of the ocean to attract the attention of the asuras whilst the
gods drank the amrita. Vishnu consenting, Siva became

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

excited and sought to embrace her. As Vishnu ran away, Siva followed
him, and though Vishnu resumed his proper form, Siva clasped him so
tightly that their

<span id="img_27600"></span> <span align="CENTER">
[![HAR-HARI.](tn/27600.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/27600.jpg.md)  
HAR-HARI.  
</span>

bodies became one, and a name Har-Hari, is given to the deities thus
united.

Siva is always represented as having a third eye situated in the middle
of his forehead; the reason of

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

this peculiarity is given in the Mahābhārata. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[\*](#fn_252.md) As he was seated on the Himalayas,
where he had been engaged in austerities, Umā, attended by her
companions, and dressed as an ascetic, came behind him and playfully put
her hands over his eyes. The effect was tremendous. Suddenly the world
became dark, lifeless and destitute of oblations. The gloom, however, is
as suddenly dispelled. A great flame burst from Mahādeva's forehead, in
which a third eye, luminous as the sun, was formed. By fire from this
eye the mountain was scorched, and everything upon it consumed. 'Lima
hereupon stands in a submissive attitude before her husband, and in a
moment, the Himālaya, her father, is restored to his former condition.

Each god is represented as having special fondness for some bird or
animal, on which he is supposed to travel, and which therefore is called
his Vāhan or vehicle. The bull is Siva's; and the image of his favourite
bull, Nandi, is seen in front of many of the shrines sacred to Mahādeva.
Owing probably to this circumstance, a curious custom prevails, similar
in many respects to the setting loose of the scapegoat by the
Israelites. At the death of a worshipper of Siva, if his friends are
pious and can afford it, they set a bullock loose, and allow it to
wander at will. By the Hindus generally it is considered a meritorious
act to feed these sacred bulls, and a sin to injure them. In country
places many of them are seen, and they become a great nuisance to the
cultivators into whose fields they wander; for though they do much
damage, as they have no owner, no compensation can be obtained. If a man
were specially devout, or his friends eminently pious, as many as seven
bulls are set loose at his decease.

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

The idea seems to be this: as Siva was delighted with Nandi, he will
graciously receive into his presence those on whose behalf these
bullocks are given.

As Siva himself lived the life of an ascetic, and practised severe
penance, a similar life is supposed to be pleasing to him; hence many of
the Saivites, or worshippers of Siva, practise great austerities, and
resort to cruel rites as a means of gaining his favour. Wandering
through the country are tens of thousands of Sanyāsis, or pilgrims, who
subsist upon charity, and expose themselves to cold and heat and many
discomforts, in the belief that their life is pleasing to this deity.
Some of them inflict upon themselves great physical pain by retaining
their arms or legs in one posture for years, until it has become
impossible to move them; others allow the thumb nail to grow through
their finger; others gaze into the sun until they become blind; others
again impose upon themselves a vow of silence, until at length they
cannot speak. At certain festivals held in his honour, the lower orders
of the people used to swing from bamboos, having iron hooks forced into
their bodies, whilst others threw themselves from a height upon sharp
knives; at the present time, though these cruel practices are prohibited
by the Government, in out-of-the-way places they are still carried on.
To assist them to bear the pain, an intoxicating drug made from hemp is
freely indulged in; the authority for this practice being the life of
the god, as described in the Purānas. As Krishna is believed to be
pleased with songs and dances, not always of a highly moral character,
Siva is believed to delight in the cruel practices of his ignorant and
intoxicated worshippers.

The following extract from the Bhāgavata, descriptive of Siva's
appearance and conduct, countenances much

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

that now forms part of his worship. Understanding that one of his
worshippers was in distress, Siva

</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "assumed half the
body of Pārvati, fastened up his matted hair, rubbed his body over with
ashes, ate a large quantity of hemp, swallow-wort and thorn-apple;

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

and wearing a Brāhmanical thread composed of white snakes, clad in an
elephant's hide, with a necklace of beads, and a garland of skulls,
riding upon Nandi, accompanied by ghosts, goblins, spectres, witches,
imps, sprites and evil spirits, Bholonāth came forth. On his forehead
was the moon; he placed the Ganges on his head, <span
id="fr_253"></span>[\*](#fn_253.md) and his eyes were very red. His most
destructive weapon was a trident: with this he slew the foe who was
obnoxious to his follower."

Though Siva's appearance is repeatedly described with considerable
minuteness in the Purānas, and in pictures he is usually represented in
the human form, it is in the form of the Linga that he is almost
universally worshipped. This image does not suggest anything offensive
to those unacquainted with its symbolic meaning, and some writers speak
of its being innocuous to the Hindus themselves. But it is impossible
for any one acquainted with the legends which account for its being the
symbol of Siva, to see and worship it without impure thoughts being
suggested. It is intended to represent the male and female reproductive
organs.

Several legends are given to explain how it came to be the
representative of Siva. The probability is that it was an object of
worship of some aboriginal tribe, incorporated into Hinduism. The "Padma
Purāna" <span id="fr_254"></span>[†](#fn_254.md) teaches that it was the
result of a curse pronounced by Bhrigu. When that Sage was sent to
discover which of the three gods was the greatest, he came to Siva's
abode, but was prevented from entering immediately he arrived by a
doorkeeper, who informed him that his master was with Devi his wife.
After waiting for some time, Bhrigu's patience being exhausted, he said,
"Since thou, O

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sankara! hast
treated me with contempt, in preferring the embraces of Pārvati, your
forms of worship shall be the Linga and Yoni."

The Vāmana <span id="fr_255"></span>[\*](#fn_255.md) makes it the result of
a curse pronounced by a number of Sages. When Sati died at Daksha's
sacrifice, Siva wandered from place to place like a madman, mourning her
absence. He travelled from hermitage to hermitage, but could find no
rest. When the hermits' wives saw him they fell desperately in love with
him and followed him from place to place. Their husbands, incensed at
this, cursed the god, and deprived him of his manhood. A great commotion
followed. Brahmā and Vishnu interceded on his behalf with the hermits,
who consented to withdraw their curse on condition that the offender
should be represented by the Linga; and thus it became an object of
worship to gods and men.

As a specimen of the legends by which the worship of Siva under this
form is inculcated, I give the following extract from the "Siva
Purāna." <span id="fr_256"></span>[†](#fn_256.md) A Rākshas named Bhīma,
have obtained invincible might as a boon from Rāma, commenced exerting
his newly acquired power by attacking the king of Kāmrupa. Having
conquered the king, and seized his kingdom and riches, he placed him in
chains in a solitary prison. The king, being eminently pious,
notwithstanding his confinement, continued daily to make clay figures of
the Linga, and to worship Siva with all the prescribed rites and
ceremonies. Meanwhile the Rākshas continued his conquests, and
everywhere abolished religious observances, and the worship enjoined in
the Vedas. The gods being reduced by his power to great distress,
appealed to Siva for help, and propitiated him by the worship of clay
Lingas.

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sāmbhu assured
them that he would effect the destruction of their enemy by means of the
king of Kāmrupa, then a prisoner. At this very moment the prisoner was
engaged in profound meditation before a Linga, when one of the guards,
seeing him thus occupied, went and informed the Rākshas that his captive
was performing some improper ceremonies in order to injure him. Hearing
this, the monster, enraged, seized his sword and hastening to the
prison, thus addressed the king: "Speak the truth, and tell me who it is
that thou worshippest, and I will not slay thee; otherwise I will
instantly put thee to death!"

The king, placing firm reliance on the protection of Siva, undauntedly
replied, "In truth, I worship Sankara; do then what thou pleasest!" The
Rākshas asked, "What can Sankara do to me? I know him well, that he was
once obliged to become the servant of my uncle (Rāvana); and thou
trusting in his power didst endeavour to conquer me; but defeat was the
result of thy attempt. However, until thou showest me thy lord, and
convincest me of his might, I will not believe in his divinity!" The
king replied, "Vile as I am, what power have I over the god? But mighty
as he is, I know he will never forsake me!" To which the Rākshas said,
"How can that delighter in ganja, and inebriation, that wandering
mendicant, protect his worshippers? Let but thy lord appear, and I will
immediately engage with him in battle." He then ordered the attendance
of his army; and reviling the king, the mighty Rākshas smiting the Linga
with his sword, said, laughing, "Now, behold the power of thy lord!"
Scarcely had his sword touched the Linga than Hara issued from it, and
exclaimed, "Behold I am Iswara (god), who appears for the protection of
his

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

worshipper, on whom he always bestows safety and happiness; now learn to
dread my might!" Siva then attacked the Rākshas, and with the glory
which issued from his third eye, consumed him and his army to ashes.

Siva is said to have a thousand names; in addition to those already
mentioned the following are most common:—

Maheswara, "The great god."

Ishwar, "The glorious."

Chandrashekara, "He who wears a half-moon on his forehead."

Bhuteswara, "Lord of Bhuts, or goblins."

Mritunjaya, "He who conquers death."

Sri Kanta, "He whose neck is beautiful."

Smarahāra, "The destroyer of Smara or Kāmdeva."

Gangadhara, "He who holds Gangā (the Ganges) in his hair."

Sthānu, "The everlasting."

Girisha, "The lord of the hills."

Digambara, "He who is clothed with space (naked)."

Bhagavat, "The lord."

Isāna, "The ruler."

Mahakāla, "The great time."

Tryambaka, "The three-eyed."

##### PANCHĀNANA.

This is a form of Siva in which he is represented, as his name teaches,
with five faces; the appearance of his body and the ascetic's dress
being the same as in his ordinary forms. It is under this name that
prayers for recovery from sickness are addressed to him as the physician
or healer. In places where there is no temple, and no image of this
deity, worship is offered to him before a shapeless stone, painted red,
placed under a

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

tree. This is a very common form of worship in the villages of Bengal.
Some shrines of Panchānana have acquired considerable celebrity, to
which women resort to obtain the gift of children as well as other
blessings. In times of sickness offerings are made to this deity

without scruple, though the sufferer is not ordinarily a worshipper of
Siva. In cases of epilepsy it is the common belief that the victim is
possessed by Panchānana, and offerings are made to induce him to depart;
recovery is. believed to be the result of the god's departure.
