## BOOK V.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   <span id="pp_0a"></span>*a*. The tenets of his Institute are
completed. Next is begun a Fifth Book, in order to set aside the primâ
facie notions of others in regard to his Institute. Among those, in the
first place he disposes of the objection that the Benediction implied by
the expression 'Well,' in the first Aphorism \[of Book I.\], is
purposeless:

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Reasons for a Benedictory Opening.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_1"></span>*Aph*. 1.[\*](#pp_1.md) The \[use of a\]
Benediction \[is justified\] by the practice of the good, by our seeing
its fruit, and by Scripture.

   <span id="pp_1a"></span>*a*. The \[use of a\] Benediction, which we
made, is proved to be proper to be made, by these proofs; such is the
<span id="page_313">p. 313</span> meaning. The word *iti* is intended to
preclude the expectation of any other reasons.

   <span id="pp_1b"></span>*b*. He repels those who entertain the primâ
facie view, that what was asserted in the expression, 'because it is not
proved that there *is* a Lord' \[see [Book I., Aph.
92](sak1.htm#pp_92.md)\], is not made out; because \[forsooth,\] his
existence is proved by his being the giver of the fruits of works:<span
id="page_313_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_313_note_3.md)

 

|                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Needlessness of a Lord.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_2"></span>*Aph*. 2.[\*](#pp_2.md) Not from its \[the
world's,\] being governed by a Lord is there the effectuation of fruit:
for it is by works \[i.e., by merit and demerit,\] that this is
accomplished.

   <span id="pp_2a"></span>*a*. That is to say: it is not proper \[to
suppose\] the effectuation of the change \[of the elements\] into the
shape of the \[appropriate\] fruit of works, on the ground that the
cause is 'governed by a Lord;' because it is possible for <span
id="page_314">p. 314</span> the fruit to be effected by the works
\[i.e., the merit and demerit,\] alone, which are indispensable; \[and,
if we *do* make the additional and cumbrous supposition of a Lord, he
cannot reward a man otherwise than according to his works\].<span
id="page_314_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_314_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_2b"></span>*b*. He declares, further, in \[several\]
aphorisms, that it is not the case that the Lord is the giver of fruit:

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The supposed Lord would be selfish.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_3"></span>*Aph*. 3.[\*](#pp_3.md) \[If a Lord were
governor, then\] from intending his own benefit, his government \[would
be selfish\], as is the case \[with ordinary governors\] in the world.

   <span id="pp_3a"></span>*a*. If the Lord were the governor, then his
government would be only for his own benefit; as is the case \[with
ordinary rulers\] in the world: such is the meaning.

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

   <span id="pp_3b"></span>*b*. In reply to the doubt, 'grant that the
Lord, also, be benefited: what harm?' he says:

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   And, therefore, not the Lord spoken of.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_4"></span>*Aph*. 4.[\*](#pp_4.md) \[He must, then, be\]
just like a worldly lord, \[and\] otherwise \[than you desire that we
should conceive of him\].

   <span id="pp_4a"></span>*a*. If we agree that the Lord, also, is
benefited, he, also, must be something mundane, 'just like a worldly
lord;' because, since his desires are \[on that supposition,\] not
\[previously\] satisfied, he must be liable to grief, &c.: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_4b"></span>*b*. In reply to the doubt, 'be it even so,'
he says:

 

|                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The difficulty perhaps originates in a mistaken expression.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_5"></span>*Aph*. 5.[\*](#pp_5.md) Or \[let the name of Lord
be\] technical.

   <span id="pp_5a"></span>*a*. If, whilst there exists also a world,
there be a Lord, then let yours, like ours, be merely a technical term
for <span id="page_316">p. 316</span> that soul which emerged at the
commencement of the creation; since there cannot be an eternal lordship,
because of the contradiction between mundaneness and the having an
unobstructed will: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_5b"></span>*b*. He states another objection to the
Lord's being the governor:

 

|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Objection to there being a Lord.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_6"></span>*Aph*. 6.[\*](#pp_6.md) This \[position, viz.,
that there is a Lord,\] cannot be established without \[assuming that he
is affected by\] Passion; because that is the determinate cause \[of all
energizing\].

   <span id="pp_6a"></span>*a*. That is to say: moreover, it cannot be
proved that he is a *governor*, unless there be Passion; because Passion
is the determinate cause of activity.

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

   <span id="pp_6b"></span>*b*. But then, be it so, that there is
Passion in the Lord, even. To this he replies:

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This objection, further.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_7"></span>*Aph*. 7.[\*](#pp_7.md) Moreover, were that
\[Pasion\] conjoined with him, he could not be eternally free.

   <span id="pp_7a"></span>*a*. That is to say: moreover, if it be
agreed that there is conjunction \[of the Lord\] with Passion, he cannot
be eternally free; and, therefore, thy tenet \[of his eternal freedom\]
is invalidated.

   <span id="pp_7b"></span>*b*. Pray \[let us ask\], does lordship arise
from the immediate union, with Soul, of the wishes, &c., which we hold
to be properties of Nature, \[not properties of Soul\]? Or from an
influence by reason of the mere existence of proximity, as in the case
of the magnet? Of these he condemns the former alternative:

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Objection, on one branch of an alternative.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_8"></span>*Aph*. 8.[\*](#pp_8.md) If it were from the
conjunction of the properties of Nature, it would turn out that there is
association, \[which Scripture denies of Soul\].

   <span id="pp_8a"></span>*a*. From the conjunction, with Soul, of 'the
properties of Nature,' i.e., Desire, &c., Soul, also, would turn out
\[contrary to Scripture,\] to be associated with properties.

   <span id="pp_8b"></span>*b*. But, in regard to the latter
\[alternative\], he says:

 

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Objection, on the other branch.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_9"></span>*Aph*. 9.[\*](#pp_9.md) If it were from the mere
existence \[of Nature, not in association, but simply in proximity\],
then lordship would belong to every one.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

   <span id="pp_9a"></span>*a*. That is to say: if lordship is by reason
of the mere existence of proximity, as in the case of the magnet \[which
becomes affected by the simple proximity of iron\], then it is settled,
as we quite intend it should be, that even all men, indifferently,
experiencers in this or that \[cycle of\] creation, \[may\] have
lordship; because it is only by conjunction with all experiencers, that
Nature produces Mind, &c. And, therefore, your tenet of there being only
one Lord is invalidated.

   <span id="pp_9b"></span>*b*. Be it as you allege; yet these are false
reasonings; because they contradict the evidence which establishes \[the
existence of\] a Lord. Otherwise, Nature, also, could be disproved by
thousands of false reasonings of the like sort. He therefore says:

 

|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Denial that there is any evidence of a Lord.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_10"></span>*Aph*. 10.[\*](#pp_10.md) It is not established
\[that there is an eternal Lord\]; because there is no evidence of it.

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

   <span id="pp_10a"></span>*a*. Its establishment, i.e., the
establishing that there is an eternal Lord. Of the Lord, in the first
place, there is not *sense*-evidence; so that only the evidences of
inference and of testimony can be offered; and these are inapplicable:
such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_10b"></span>*b*. The inapplicability he sets forth in
two aphorisms:

 

|                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Denial that it can be established by inference.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_11"></span>*Aph*. 11.[\*](#pp_11.md) There is no
inferential proof \[of there being a Lord\]; because there is \[here\]
no \[case of invariable\] association \[between a sign and that which it
might betoken\].

   <span id="pp_11a"></span>*a*. 'Association,' i.e., invariable
concomitancy. 'There is none;' i.e., none exists, \[in this case\]. And
so there is no inferential proof of there being a Lord; because, in such
arguments as, 'Mind, or the like, has a maker, because it is a product,'
\[the fact of\] invariable concomitancy<span
id="page_320_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_320_note_3.md) is not established,
since there is no compulsion \[that every product should have had an
intelligent maker\]. Such is the meaning.

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

   <span id="pp_11b"></span>*b*. Nor, moreover, he tells us, is there
\[the evidence of\] Testimony \[to there being a Lord\]:

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Denial that there is Scripture for it.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_12"></span>*Aph*. 12.[\*](#pp_12.md) Moreover, there is
Scripture for \[this world's\] being the product of Nature, \[not of a
Lord\].

   <span id="pp_12a"></span>*a*. Scripture asserts, exclusively, that
the world is the product of Nature, not that it has Soul for its cause.

   <span id="pp_12b"></span>*b*. He refutes, diffusely, by a cluster
\[of seven aphorisms\],<span
id="page_321_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_321_note_3.md) the opinion of an
opponent in regard to that which was established in the first
Section,<span id="page_321_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_321_note_4.md) viz.,
'Bondage does not arise from Ignorance,' \[conjoined with Soul\].

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

 

|                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Conjunction, in the case of the solitary, would be a contradiction.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_13"></span>*Aph*. 13.[\*](#pp_13.md) With that which is
solitary there cannot be conjunction of the property of Ignorance.

   <span id="pp_13a"></span>*a*. Since Soul has no association \[with
anything whatever\], it is plainly impossible for it to be united with
the property of Ignorance.

   <span id="pp_13b"></span>*b*. But then, \[it may be replied,\] what
is to be asserted is, that the conjunction of Ignorance is simply
through force of Ignorance \[which is a negation, or nonentity\]; and
so, since this is no *reality*, there is no *association* occasioned
thereby. To this he replies:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A suggestion repelled.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_14"></span>*Aph*. 14.[\*](#pp_14.md) Since the existence of
this \[alleged *negative* Ignorance\] is established \[only\] on the
ground of its \[pretended\] conjunction, there is a vicious circle.<span
id="page_322_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_322_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_14a"></span>*a*. And, if it is by the conjunction of
Ignorance that Ignorance is established, there is 'a vicious circle,'
\[literally, <span id="page_323">p. 323</span> a resting of each on the
other, alternately\], a resting a thing on itself; or, in short, a
*regressus in infinitum*.

   <span id="pp_14b"></span>*b*. In reply to the doubt \[suggested by
the Naiyáyika\], 'but then, as in the case of seed and sprout, the
*regressus in infinitum* is no objection,' he replies:

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The world has a beginning.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_15"></span>*Aph*. 15.[\*](#pp_15.md) It is not as in the
case of seed and sprout; for Scripture teaches that the world has a
beginning.

   <span id="pp_15a"></span>*a*. There cannot belong to it such a
*regressus in infinitum* as that of seed and sprout; because there is
Scripture for the fact that the mundane state of souls, consisting of
all undesirable things, viz., Ignorance, &c., had a beginning. For we
hear, in Scripture, that these cease to exist at the dissolution of all
things, in profound sleep, &c. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_15b"></span>*b*. But then, \[you Vedántís will say\],
according to us, Ignorance is technically so termed, and is not, e.g.,
in <span id="page_324">p. 324</span> the shape, specified by the *Yoga*,
of supposing what is not soul to be soul; and so, just like your
'Nature,' since this \[Ignorance\] of ours has an unbroken eternity,
though it be lodged in Soul, there is no disparagement of the
solitariness thereof: in regard to this doubt, having deliberated on
this artificial sense of the word 'Ignorance,' he objects to it:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul and knowledge not identical.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_16"></span>*Aph*. 16.[\*](#pp_16.md) Then Brahma would be
found to be excluded \[from existence\]; because he is something else
than knowledge.

   <span id="pp_16a"></span>*a*. If the meaning of the word 'Ignorance'
(*avidyá*) be only 'otherness than knowledge,' then *Brahma*, soul
itself, would be found to be excluded, to perish, through his being
annihilable by knowledge; since *he* is other than knowledge: such is
the meaning. \[Further\]:

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

 

|                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Knowledge, not excluding ignorance, would be resultless.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_17"></span>*Aph*. 17.[\*](#pp_17.md) Were there not
exclusion, then there would be resultlesseness.

   <span id="pp_17a"></span>*a*. But, if, the existence of ignorance
were really not excluded by knowledge, then there would be
resultlessness of knowledge, because of its not debarring Ignorance,
\[which is the only result competent to knowledge\]: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_17b"></span>*b*. He censures the other alternative,
\[viz., that knowledge *might* exclude Soul\]:

 

|                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   On the Vedánta theory, the world ought to vanish.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_18"></span>*Aph*. 18.[\*](#pp_18.md) If it \[Ignorance,\]
meant the being excludible by Knowledge, it would be \[predicable\], in
like manner, of the world, also.

   <span id="pp_18a"></span>*a*. If, on the other hand, the being
excludible by Knowledge, in the case of the soul, which possesses
properties, <span id="page_326">p. 326</span> be, indeed, what is meant
by the being Ignorance, in that case 'the world,' the whole mundane
system, viz., Nature, Mind, &c., would, also, in like manner, be
Ignorance. And so, the whole mundane system being merely Ignorance,
since the Ignorance would be annihilated by one man's knowledge, the
mundane system would become invisible to others, also. Such is the
import.

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Vedánta theory self-contradictory.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_19"></span>*Aph*. 19.[\*](#pp_19.md) If it \[Ignorance,\]
were of *that* nature it would be something that had a
commencement.<span id="page_326_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_326_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_19a"></span>*a*. Or suppose it to be the case, that to
be Ignorance means simply the being excludible by Knowledge, still such
a thing could not have had an *eternal* existence in souls \[as held by
Vedántís (see [§ 15, *b*.](#pp_15b).md)\], but must have had a
commencement. For it is proved, by such recited <span id="page_327">p.
327</span> texts as, 'Consisting of knowledge alone,'<span
id="page_327_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_327_note_1.md)<span
id="page_327_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_327_note_2.md) &c., that, at the time
of the universal dissolution, &c., the soul consists of Knowledge alone.
Such is the meaning. Therefore, it is settled that there is no other
Ignorance, annihilable by Knowledge, than that stated in the *Yoga*
system; and this is a property of the understanding only, not a property
of the soul.

   <span id="pp_19b"></span>*b*. By a cluster of \[six\] aphorisms,<span
id="page_327_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_327_note_4.md) he clears up the primâ
facie view of an opponent, in regard to that which was stated in the
same Book \[[Book V., § 2](sak5.htm#pp_2.md)\], that Nature's energizing is
due to Merit:

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

 

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Merit is undeniable.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_20"></span>*Aph*. 20.[\*](#pp_20.md) There is no denying
Merit; because of the diversity in the operations of Nature.

   <span id="pp_20a"></span>*a*. Merit is not to be denied on the ground
of its being no object of sense; because it is inferred; since,
otherwise, 'the diversity in the operations of Nature' \[accommodating
one person, and inconveniencing another,\] would be unaccounted for:
such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_20b"></span>*b*. He states further proof, also:

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Proofs of this.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_21"></span>*Aph*. 21.[\*](#pp_21.md) It \[the existence of
Merit,\] is established by Scripture, by tokens, &c.

   <span id="pp_21a"></span>*a*. He shows to be a fallacy the argument
of the opponent, that Merit exists not, because of there being no
sense-evidence of it:

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

 

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Sense-evidence not the only kind of evidence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_22"></span>*Aph*. 22.[\*](#pp_22.md) There is, here, no
necessity; for there is room for other proofs.

   <span id="pp_22a"></span>*a*. That is to say: there is no necessity
that a thing of which there is no mundane sense-evidence must be
non-existent; because things are subject to *other* proofs.

   <span id="pp_22b"></span>*b*. He proves that there exists Demerit, as
well as Merit:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Demerit as certain as Merit.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_23"></span>*Aph*. 23.[\*](#pp_23.md) It is thus, moreover,
in both cases.

   <span id="pp_23a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the proofs apply to
Demerit, just as they do to Merit.

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The proof of each the same.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_24"></span>*Aph*. 24.[\*](#pp_24.md) If the existence \[of
Merit\] be as of course, \[because, otherwise, something would be
unaccounted for\], the same is the case in respect of both.

   <span id="pp_24a"></span>*a*. But then, *merit* is proved to exist by
a natural consequence in this shape, viz., that, otherwise, an
injunction <span id="page_330">p. 330</span> would be unaccounted for;
but there is none such in respect of *demerit*: so how can Scriptural or
logical argument be extended to *demerit*? If any one says this, it is
not so; since there is proof, in the shape of natural consequence, 'it
is alike, in respect of both,' i.e., of both merit and demerit; because,
otherwise, a *prohibitory* injunction, such as, 'He should not approach
another's wife,' would be unaccounted for. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_24b"></span>*b*. He repels the doubt, that, if Merit,
&c., be acknowledged \[to exist\], then, in consequence of souls' having
properties, &c., they must be liable to modification, &c.:

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Merit, &c., inhere in what.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_25"></span>*Aph*. 25.[\*](#pp_25.md) It is of the internal
organ<span id="page_330_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_330_note_3.md) \[not of
*soul*\] that Merit, &c., are the properties.

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

   <span id="pp_25a"></span>*a*. In the expression '&c.' are included
all those that are stated, in the *Vaiśeshika* Institute, as peculiar
qualities of soul.<span id="page_331_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_331_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_25b"></span>*b*. \[To the objection, that the existence
of an internal organ, as well as of the Qualities from which such might
arise, is debarred by Scripture, be replies\]:

 

|                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Qualities exist, though not in soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_26"></span>*Aph*. 26.[\*](#pp_26.md) And of the Qualities,
&c., there is not absolute debarment.

   <span id="pp_26a"></span>*a*. The Qualities, viz., Purity, &c., and
their properties, viz., happiness, &c., and their products, also, viz.,
Mind, &c., are not denied essentially, but are denied only adjunctively
in respect of soul; just as we deny that heat \[in red-hot iron,\]
belongs to the iron.

   <span id="pp_26b"></span>*b*. In regard to the doubt, 'Why, again, do
we not deny <span id="page_332">p. 332</span> them an essence, as we do
to what is meant by the words *sleep*, *wish*, &c.?' he says:

 

|                                                          |

| <span class="small">*   The above thesis argued.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_27"></span>*Aph*. 27.[\*](#pp_27.md) By a conjunction of
the five members \[of an argumentative statement\] we discern \[that\]
Happiness \[exists\].

   <span id="pp_27a"></span>*a*. Here, in order to get a particular
subject of his assertion, he takes *happiness* alone, one portion of the
matter in dispute, as a representative of the entire matter. But the
better reading is, 'we discern \[that\] Happiness, &c., \[exist\].' The
five members of an argumentative statement are the Proposition, Reason,
Example, Synthesis \[of the two premises\], and Conclusion; and, by the
'conjunction,' i.e., the combination, of these, all things, viz.,
Happiness, &c., are proved to exist. Such is the meaning.

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

   <span id="pp_27b"></span>*b*. And the employment \[of the argument\]
is this:

|       |                                                                           |

| \(2\) | Because it produces motion in something.                                  |
| \(3\) | Whatever produces motion in anything is real, as are sentient beings;     |
| \(4\) | And pleasure produces motion in things, in the way of horripilation, &c.: |
| \(5\) | Therefore, it is real.                                                    |

   <span id="pp_27c"></span>*c*. But then the *Chárváka*, next, doubts
whether there be any evidence other than sense-evidence; since \[he
contends,\] there is no truth in the assertion \[of an inductive
conclusion\], that such and such is pervaded by such and such, &c.<span

| <span class="small">*   The validity of inference questioned.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_28"></span>*Aph*. 28.[\*](#pp_28.md) Not from once
apprehending is a connexion established.

   <span id="pp_28a"></span>*a*. That is to say: from *once*
apprehending concomitance \[of a supposed token and the thing
betokened\], a 'connexion,' i.e., a pervadedness \[or invariable
attendedness of the token by the betokened,\] is not established; and
*frequency* \[of the same apprehension\] follows<span
id="page_334_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_334_note_1.md) \[the rule of the single
apprehension; just as a thousand times nothing amount to nothing\].
Therefore \[argues the sceptic,\] since the apprehending of an
invariable attendedness is impossible, nothing can be established by
*Inference*. \[This\] he clears up:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This point cleared up.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_29"></span>*Aph*. 29.[\*](#pp_29.md) Pervadedness is a
constant consociation of characters, in the case of both, or of one of
them.

   <span id="pp_29a"></span>*a*. 'Consociation of characters,' i.e.,
consociation in the fact of being characters \[or properties of
something\]; in short, concomitancy. And so we mean, that that
concomitancy is 'pervadedness,' \[furnishing solid ground for
inference\], <span id="page_335">p. 335</span> which is invariably
non-errant, whether in the case of 'both,' the predicate and the reason,
or in the case of 'one of them,' the reason only. 'Of both' is mentioned
with reference to the case of 'equal pervadedness': \[e.g., every
equilateral triangle is equiangular, and, conversely, every equiangular
triangle is equilateral\]. And the invariableness may be apprehended
through an appropriate confutation \[or *reductio ad absurdum* of the
denial of it\]; so that there is no impossibility in apprehending
'pervadedness,' \[and of inferring on the strength of it\]. Such is the
import.

   <span id="pp_29b"></span>*b*. He declares that Pervadedness is not an
additional principle, consisting, e.g., of some such power as is to be
mentioned \[in [§ 31](#pp_31.md)\]:

 

|                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Pervadedness not an additional principle.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_30"></span>*Aph*. 30.[\*](#pp_30.md) It \[Pervadedness,\]
is not \[as some think (see [§ 31](#pp_31).md),\] an additional principle
\[over and above the twenty-five ([Book I., § 61](sak1.htm#pp_61).md)\];
for it is unsuitable to postulate entities \[*praeter rationem*\].

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

   <span id="pp_30a"></span>*a*. 'Pervadedness' is not an entity other
than a fixed consociation of characters; because it is unsuitable to
suppose, further, some entity as the residence of what constitutes
'pervadedness.' But we consider that what constitutes 'pervadedness'
belongs to extant things simply. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_30b"></span>*b*. He states the opinion of others:

 

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A heterodox opinion regarding 'Pervadedness.'*</span> |

   <span id="pp_31"></span>*Aph*. 31.[\*](#pp_31.md) \[But certain\]
teachers say that it \[Pervadedness,\] is \[another principle, in
addition to the twenty-five,\] resulting from the power of the thing
itself.

   <span id="pp_31a"></span>*a*. But other teachers assert that
'Pervadedness' is, positively, a separate principle, in the shape of a
species of power, generated by the native power of the 'pervaded.' But
\[they continue,\] 'Pervadedness' is not simply a power of the
\[pervaded\] thing itself; else it would exist wherever the thing is,
\[which 'pervadedness' does *not* do\]. For smoke, when it has gone to
another place \[than the point of its origination\], is not attended by
fire; and, by going into another place, that power is put an end to.
Therefore \[contend these teachers,\] there is no over-extension in the
<span id="page_337">p. 337</span> above-stated definition; for,
according to our doctrine, the smoke \[which betokens fire\] is to be
specialized as that which is at the time of origination. Such is the
import.

| <span class="small">*   Opinion of Panchaśikha*</span> |

   <span id="pp_32"></span>*Aph*. 32.[\*](#pp_32.md) Panchaśikha<span
id="page_337_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_337_note_2.md) says that it
\['Pervadedness,'\] is the possession of the power of the sustained.

   <span id="pp_32a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Panchaśikha holds that
*pervadingness* is the power which consists in being the *sustainer*,
and that 'Pervadedness'<span
id="page_337_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_337_note_3.md) is the having the power
which consists in being the sustained; for Intellect, and the rest, are
treated as being pervaded \[or invariably attended,\] by Nature, &c.;
<span id="page_338">p. 338</span> \[and this means that each product, in
succession\] is *sustained* by what precedes it in the series\].

   <span id="pp_32b"></span>*b*. But then, why is a 'power of the
sustained' postulated? Let 'Pervadedness' be simply an essential power
of the *thing* pervaded. To this he \[Panchaśikha,\] replies:

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Panchaśikha's reply to the objection.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_33"></span>*Aph*. 33.[\*](#pp_33.md) The relation is not an
essential power; for we should have \[in that case,\] a tautology.

   <span id="pp_33a"></span>*a*. But 'the relation,' viz.,
'Pervadedness,' is not an essential power; for we should \[thus\] have a
tautology; because, just as there is no difference between 'water-jar'
and 'jar for water,' so, also, there is none in the case of 'Intellect'
and 'what is Pervaded' \[by Nature, of which Intellect consists\]. Such
is the meaning.

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

   <span id="pp_33b"></span>*b*. He himself explains the 'Tautology:'

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The reason why.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_34"></span>*Aph*. 34.[\*](#pp_34.md) Because we should find
the distinction unmeaning; \[as Intellect does not differ from Nature at
all, except as does the sustained from the sustainer\].

   <span id="pp_34a"></span>*a*. This is almost explained by the
preceding aphorism.

   <span id="pp_34b"></span>*b*. He \[Panchaśikha,\] mentions another
objection:

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A further reason.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_35"></span>*Aph*. 35.[\*](#pp_35.md) And because it
\[Pervadedness,\] would not be reconcilable in shoots, &c.

   <span id="pp_35a"></span>*a*. Because shoots, &c., are invariably
attended \[at their origination,\] by trees, &c. But this cannot be
called simply an essential power \[in the shoot\]; because, since the
essential power \[that which belongs to the shoot *as being* a shoot,\]
does not depart, even in the case of an amputated shoot, we should, even
then, find it attended \[by the tree, which, however, no longer
accompanies it\]. Such is the sense. But the power \[(see [§
32](#pp_32).md), which consists in having the <span id="page_340">p.
340</span> character\] of the 'sustained' is destroyed at the time of
amputation; so that there is no 'Pervadedness' *then*. Such is the
import.

   <span id="pp_35b"></span>*b*. But then what? Panchaśikha says that
'Pervadedness' is not a result of any *essential* power. Then, since
smoke is not *sustained* by fire \[see [§ 32](#pp_32.md), where he contends
that 'sustainedness' is what really expresses *pervasion*\], it would
turn out that it \[viz., smoke,\] is not \[as token of something that is
betokened,\] *accompanied* by fire. To this he says:

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Reply, that this would prove too much.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_36"></span>*Aph*. 36.[\*](#pp_36.md) Were it \[thus\]
settled that it is a power of the 'sustained,' then, by the like
argument, its dependence on an essential power, \[as pretended by the
heterodox teachers <span id="page_341">p. 341</span> referred to in [§
31](#pp_31.md), might be proved, also; and thus the argument proves
nothing, since it proves too much\].

   <span id="pp_36a"></span>*a*. That is to say: 'were it settled' that
'a power of the sustained' constitutes the fact of 'Pervadedness,' it
would be really settled 'by the like argument.' i.e., by parity of
reasoning, that the fact of 'Pervadedness' results from essential power,
also, \[[§ 31. *a*.](#pp_31a.md)\].

   <span id="pp_36b"></span>*b*. It was with a view to substantiate what
was stated \[in [§ 27](#pp_27.md)\], viz., that the Qualities, and the
rest, are established \[as realities,\] by the employment of the
five-membered \[form of argumentative exposition\], that he has
repelled, by an exposition of 'Pervadedness,' the objection to Inference
as evidence, \[or as a means of attaining right notions\].

   <span id="pp_36c"></span>*c*. Now, in order to establish the fact
that *words*, of which the five-membered \[exposition\] consists, are
generators of knowledge, the objection of others to a *word's* being a
means of right knowledge,<span
id="page_341_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_341_note_3.md) in the shape of \[the
objection <span id="page_342">p. 342</span> of\] its being inadequate,
is disposed of, by means of an exposition of the powers, &c., of words:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Sound and sense.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_37"></span>*Aph*. 37.[\*](#pp_37.md) The connexion between
word and meaning is the relation of expressed and expresser.

   <span id="pp_37a"></span>*a*. To the 'meaning' belongs the power
termed expressibleness; to the 'word,' the power termed expression:
simply this is their 'connexion;' their interrelation, as it were.<span
id="page_342_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_342_note_3.md) <span id="page_343">p.
343</span> From one's knowing this \[connexion between a given word and
meaning\], the meaning is suggested \[or raised in the mind,\] by the
word. Such is the import.

   <span id="pp_37b"></span>*b*. He mentions what things cause one to
apprehend the powers \[in question\]:

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Sense of words how learned.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_38"></span>*Aph*. 38.[\*](#pp_38.md) The connexion
\[between a word and its sense\] is determined by three \[means\].

   <span id="pp_38a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the connexion \[just\]
mentioned \[in [§ 37](#pp_37.md),\] is apprehended by means of these three,
viz., information from one competent \[to tell us the meaning\], the
usage of the old man \[whose orders to his sons we hear, and then
observe what actions ensue, in consequence (see the *Sáhitya-darpaṉa*, §
11)\], and application to the same thing which has a familiar name,
\[whence we gather the sense of the less familiar synonym\].

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

 

|                                                               |

restriction to what is to be done; because we see it both ways.

   <span id="pp_39a"></span>*a*. That is to say: and there is no
necessity that this apprehension of the powers \[[§ 37](#pp_37.md),\]
should occur only in the case of 'something \[directed\] to be done;'
because, in \[the secular life and dealings of\] the world, we see the
usage of the old man, &c., \[[§ 38](#pp_38.md),\] in regard to what is
*not* to be done \[being something already extant\], also, as well as in
regard to what is to be done.

 

|                                                                                  |

   <span id="pp_40"></span>*Aph*. 40.[\*](#pp_40.md) He who is accomplished
in the secular \[connexion of words with meanings\] can understand the
sense of the Veda.

   <span id="pp_40a"></span>*a*. Here he entertains a doubt:

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

 

|                                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A doubt.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_41"></span>*Aph*. 41.[\*](#pp_41.md) Not by the three
\[means mentioned in [§ 38](#pp_38.md), objects some one, can the sense of
the Veda be gathered\]; because the Veda is superhuman, and what it
means transcends the senses.

   <span id="pp_41a"></span>*a*. Of these he first repels the assertion,
that what is meant \[by the Veda\] is something transcending the senses:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This cleared up.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_42"></span>*Aph*. 42.[\*](#pp_42.md) Not so \[i.e., what is
meant by the Veda is not something transcending the senses\]; because
sacrificings, &c., are, in themselves, what constitutes merit,
preeminently.

   <span id="pp_42a"></span>*a*. What is asserted \[in [§ 41](#pp_41.md),\]
is not the case; since sacrificings, gifts, &c., in the shape, e.g., of
the relinquishment of some thing for the sake of the gods, are really,
in themselves, 'what constitutes merit,' i.e., what is enjoined by the
Veda, 'preeminently,' i.e., because of their having preeminent fruit.
And sacrificings, &c., since they are in the shape of wishings, &c.,
\[of which we are perfectly conscious,\] are not something transcending
intuition. But 'what constitutes merit' \[which the objector supposes to
transcend intuition,\] does not belong to something mysterious that
resides in sacrificings <span id="page_346">p. 346</span> &c., whence
what is enjoined in the Veda must be beyond intuition. Such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_42b"></span>*b*. He repels also what was asserted \[in
[§ 41](#pp_41.md)\], viz., that, inasmuch as it \[the Veda,\] is
superhuman, there can be no instruction by any competent person, \[in
regard to its import\]:

 

|                                                                    |

   <span id="pp_43"></span>*Aph*. 43.[\*](#pp_43.md) The natural force \[of
the terms in the Veda\] is ascertained through the conversancy
\[therewith of those who successively transmit the knowledge\].

   <span id="pp_43a"></span>*a*. But then, still, how can there be
apprehension of the sense of Vaidic terms, in the case of gods, fruits
\[of actions\], &c., which transcend sense? To this he replies:

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

 

|                                                                         |

   <span id="pp_44"></span>*Aph*. 44.[\*](#pp_44.md) This really takes
place; because they \[viz., the words,\] give rise to knowledge, in the
case both of things adapted \[to sense\] and of things not \[so\]
adapted.

   <span id="pp_44a"></span>*a*. He defines the, peculiarities which
belong to words, just because this matter is connected with the question
of the power of words to cause right knowledge:<span

are not the work of \[the Supreme\] Man; because there is no such thing
as the \[Supreme\] Man, \[whom you allude to as being, possibly,\] their
maker.

   <span id="pp_46a"></span>*a*. Supply, 'because we deny that, there is
a *Lord*.'<span id="page_348_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_348_note_1.md) \[This
is\] simple.

   <span id="pp_46b"></span>*b*. Adverting to the anticipation that
there may be some other author, he says:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Who are not authors of the Vedas.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_47"></span>*Aph*. 47.[\*](#pp_47.md) Since the liberated is
unsuited \[to the work, by his indifference\], and the unliberated is
so, \[by his want of power\] neither of these can be author of the
Vedas\].<span id="page_348_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_348_note_4.md)

   <span id="pp_47a"></span>*a*. But then, in that case, since they are
not the work of \[the Supreme\] Man, it follows that they are eternal.
To this he replies:

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An illustration.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_48"></span>*Aph*. 48.[\*](#pp_48.md) As in the case of
sprouts, &c., their eternity does not follow from their not being the
work of \[any Supreme\] Man.

   <span id="pp_48a"></span>*a*. \[This is\] plain.

   <span id="pp_48b"></span>*b*. But then, since sprouts, &c., also,
just like jars, &c., are productions, we must infer that they are the
work of \[the Supreme\] Man. To this he replies:

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Plants denied to be works.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_49"></span>*Aph*. 49.[\*](#pp_49.md) Were this the case
with these, also, \[i.e., if it were the case that vegetables were
works\], we should find a contradiction to experience, &c.

   <span id="pp_49a"></span>*a*. It is seen, in the world, as an
invariable fact,<span id="page_349_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_349_note_3.md)
that whatever is the work of Man is produced by a *body*. This would be
debarred, &c., were the case as you contend; \[for we see no *embodied*
Supreme Man to whose handiwork the sprouts of the earth can be
referred\]. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_49b"></span>*b*. But then, since they were uttered by
the Primal <span id="page_350">p. 350</span> Man, the Vedas, moreover,
are, really, the work of \[the Supreme\] Man. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Only what is voluntary is a work.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_50"></span>*Aph*. 50.[\*](#pp_50.md) That \[only\] is Man's
work, in respect of which, even be it something invisible, an effort of
understanding takes place.<span
id="page_350_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_350_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_50a"></span>*a*. As in the case of what is visible, so,
too, in the case of what is invisible, in respect of what thing there
takes place 'an effort of understanding,' i.e., a consciousness that
Thought preceded,<span id="page_350_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_350_note_3.md)
that thing alone is spoken of as Man's work: such is the meaning. Thus
it has been remarked <span id="page_351">p. 351</span> that a thing is
not Man's work merely through its having been uttered by Man; for no one
speaks of the respiration during profound sleep as being Man's work,
\[or voluntary act\]. But what need to speak of antecedence of
Understanding? The Vedas, just like an expiration, proceed, of
themselves, from the Self-existent, through the force of fate, wholly
unpreceded by thought. Therefore, they are not \[a Supreme\] Man's
work.<span id="page_351_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_351_note_2.md)

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

   <span id="pp_50b"></span>*b*. But then, in that case, since they are
not preceded by a correct knowledge of the sense of the sentences,<span
id="page_352_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_352_note_1.md) the Vedas, moreover,
like the speech of a parrot, can convey no right knowledge.<span
id="page_352_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_352_note_2.md) To this he replies:

 

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Vedas their own evidence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_51"></span>*Aph*. 51.[\*](#pp_51.md) They are,
spontaneously, conveyers of right knowledge, from the patentness of
their own power \[to instruct rightly\].

   <span id="pp_51a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the
authoritativeness<span id="page_352_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_352_note_5.md)
of the very whole of the Vedas is established, not by such a thing as
its being based on the enouncer's knowledge of the truth, but quite
'spontaneously;' because, as for the Vedas' 'own,' i.e., natural, power
of generating right knowledge, *thereof* we perceive the manifestation
in the invocations<span id="page_352_fr_6"></span>[6](#page_352_note_6.md)
\[which produce the result promised\], and in the Medical <span
id="page_353">p. 353</span> Scripture, \[the following of which leads to
cures\], &c. And so there is the aphorism of the *Nyáya* \[Book II., §
681\]: 'And \[the fact of\] its being a cause of right knowledge, like
the validity of invocations, and the Medical Scripture,' &c.

   <span id="pp_51b"></span>*b*. In regard to the proposition \[laid
down in [§ 26](#pp_26.md), viz.\], 'And of the \[existence of the\]
Qualities, &c., there is not absolute debarment,' there was duly
alleged, and developed \[under [§ 27](#pp_27.md)\], one argument, viz., by
the establishing the Existence of Happiness, &c. Now he states another
argument in respect of that \[same proposition\]:

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Cognition is evidence of existence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_52"></span>*Aph*. 52.[\*](#pp_52.md) There is no Cognition
of what is no entity, as a man's horn.

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

   <span id="pp_52a"></span>*a*. Be it, moreover, that the existence of
pleasure, &c., is proved by the reasoning \[under [§ 27](#pp_27.md)\]; it
is proved by mere consciousness, also. Of pleasure, &c., were they
absolutely *nonentities*, even the *consciousness* could not be
accounted for; because there is no cognition of a man's horn, and the
like. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_52b"></span>*b*. But then, \[interposes the
*Naiyáyika*,\] if such be the case, let the Qualities, &c., be quite
absolutely *real*; and then, in the expression 'not *absolute*
debarment' \[in [§ 26](#pp_26.md)\], the word 'absolute' is \[superfluous,
and, hence,\] unmeaning. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Qualities, &c., not absolutely real.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_53"></span>*Aph*. 53.[\*](#pp_53.md) It is not of the
*real* \[that there is here cognizance\]; because exclusion is seen \[of
the Qualities\].

   <span id="pp_53a"></span>*a*. It is not proper \[to say\], moreover,
that the cognizance of the Qualities, &c., is that of the absolutely
real; because we see that they are excluded \[and not admitted <span
id="page_355">p. 355</span> to exist,\] at the time of destruction \[of
the mundane system\], &c.

   <span id="pp_53b"></span>*b*. But then, even on that showing, let the
world be different both from real and from unreal; nevertheless, the
demurring to absolute debarment \[in [§ 26](#pp_26.md),\] is untenable. To
this he replies:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A Vedántic advance rejected.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_54"></span>*Aph*. 54.[\*](#pp_54.md) It is not of what
cannot be \[intelligibly\] expressed \[that there is cognizance\];
because there exists no such thing.

   <span id="pp_54a"></span>*a*. And there takes place, moreover, no
cognizance of such \[a thing\] as is not to be expressed as either
existing or not existing; 'because there. exists no such thing,' i.e.,
because nothing is known other than what exists, or what does not exist:
such is the meaning. The import is, because it is proper to form
suppositions only in accordance with what is seen.

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

   <span id="pp_54b"></span>*b*. But then, on that showing, do you
really approve of \[the *Nyáya* notion of\] 'cognizing otherwise,' \[or
our fancying that nature to belong to one, which belongs to another\]?
He replies, 'No':

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A Nyáya view rejected.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_55"></span>*Aph*. 55.[\*](#pp_55.md) There is no such thing
as cognizing otherwise \[or cognizing that as belonging to one, which
belongs to another\]; because your own proposition is self-destructive.

   <span id="pp_55a"></span>*a*. This, also, is not proper \[to be
said\], viz., that one thing appears under the character of another
thing \[e.g., a rope, under the character of a serpent, for which it may
be mistaken, in the dusk\]; 'because your own proposition is
self-destructive.'<span id="page_356_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_356_note_4.md)
Of another nature \[e.g., snakehood\], in a different thing \[e.g., a
rope\], *equivalence to a man's horn*, is \[what is virtually\]
expressed by the word 'otherwise' \[than the truth; both a man's horn,
and the presence of snakehood in a rope mistaken for a snake, being,
alike, otherwise than real\]; and \[yet\] its *cognition* \[thus\]
*otherwise* is asserted, \[as if *that* could be cognized which is
equivalent to what can *not* be cognized\]: hence your own <span
id="page_357">p. 357</span> proposition is self-destructive. For even
those who contend for 'cognizing otherwise' \[as one mode of
cognition,\] declare that the cognition of what *does not exist* is
impossible. Such is the meaning.<span
id="page_357_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_357_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_55b"></span>*b*. Expounding what he had said above, \[in
[§ 26](#pp_26.md),\] 'not absolute debarment,' he sums up his doctrine:

 

|                                             |
|---------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Summing up.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_56"></span>*Aph*. 56.[\*](#pp_56.md) They \[the
Qualities,\] are cognized rightly or wrongly, through their being denied
and not denied \[appropriately or otherwise\].

   <span id="pp_56a"></span>*a*. All the Qualities, &c., 'are cognized
rightly and <span id="page_358">p. 358</span> wrongly.' How? 'Through
their being denied and not denied.' There is *non-denial*, as far as
regards their existing at all; because all things \[and things are made
up of the Qualities,\] are eternal. But there is denial, *relatively*,
in Soul, of all things; just as is the case with the imaginary silver,
for example, in a pearl-oyster, &c., or with the redness, &c., in
crystal, &c., \[which has no redness, without its following that
redness, altogether and everywhere, is non-existent\].

   <span id="pp_56b"></span>*b*. This investigation is concluded. Now
the consideration of Words, it having presented itself in this
connexion, is taken in hand incidentally, at the end; \[the Sánkhya not
allowing to Testimony a coordinate rank with Sense and Inference\]:

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Yoga theory of speech rejected.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_57"></span>*Aph*. 57.[\*](#pp_57.md) A word does not
consist of \[what the *Yogas* call\] the 'expresser' (*sphoṭa*); by
reason both of cognizance \[which would disprove the existence of such
imaginary <span id="page_359">p. 359</span> thing,\] and of
non-cognizance, \[which would, in like manner, disprove it\].

   <span id="pp_57a"></span>*a*. It is held, by the followers of the
*Yoga*, that there exists, in distinction from the several letters, an
indivisible \[unit, the\] word, such as 'jar,' &c., \[which they call\]
the 'expression;'<span id="page_359_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_359_note_1.md)
just as there is a jar, or the like, possessing parts, which is
something else than the parts, viz., the shell-shaped neck, &c.; and
that particular sound, termed a word, is called the 'expresser,' because
of its making apparent the meaning: such a word \[we Sánkhyas assert, in
opposition to the *Yogas*,\] is without evidence \[of its existence\].
Why? 'By reason both of cognizance and of non-cognizance,' \[as thus\]:
Pray, is that word \[which you choose to call the 'expression,'\]
cognized, or not? On the former alternative, what need of that idle
thing, \[the supposed 'expression'? For,\] by what collection of
letters, distinguished by a particular succession, this \['expression'\]
is manifested, let *that* be what acquaints us with the meaning. But, on
the latter alternative, \[viz., that it is not cognized\], the power of
acquainting us with a meaning does not belong to an 'expression' which
is not cognized. Therefore, the hypothesis of an 'expresser' is useless.
Such is the meaning.

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

   <span id="pp_57b"></span>*b*. The eternity of the Vedas was
contradicted<span id="page_360_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_360_note_1.md)
before, \[under [§ 45](#pp_45.md)\]. Now he contradicts also the eternity
of *letters*:

 

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The eternity of letters denied.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_58"></span>*Aph*. 58.[\*](#pp_58.md) Sound is not eternal;
because we perceive it to be made.

   <span id="pp_58a"></span>*a*. It is not proper \[to say, as the
Mímánsakas say\], that letters are eternal, on the strength of our
recognizing, e.g., that 'This is that same G'; for they are proved to be
non-eternal, by the cognition, e.g., that '\[the sound of\] G has been
produced': such is the meaning. And the *recognition* <span
id="page_361">p. 361</span> has reference to the *homogeneousness* with
that \[one which had been previously heard\]; for, otherwise, it would
turn out that a *jar*, or the like, is eternal, inasmuch as it is
*recognized*.

   <span id="pp_58b"></span>*b*. He ponders a doubt:

 

|                                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A doubt.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_59"></span>*Aph*. 59.[\*](#pp_59.md) \[Suppose that\] there
is \[in the case of sounds,\] the manifestation of something whose
existence was previously settled; as \[the manifestation\] of a
\[preexistent\] jar by a lamp.

   <span id="pp_59a"></span>*a*. But then \[some one may say\], of
Sound, whose existence was 'previously settled,' the manifestation,
through noise, &c., *that* alone is the object in the cognition of its
*production*, \[which you speak of in [§ 58](#pp_58.md)\]. An example of
manifestation \[of a thing previously existing\] is, 'as of a jar by a
lamp.'

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

   <span id="pp_59b"></span>*b*. He repels this:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The doubt disposed of.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_60"></span>*Aph*. 60.[\*](#pp_60.md) If the dogma of
products' being real \[is accepted by you\], then this is a proving of
the already proved.

   <span id="pp_60a"></span>*a*. If you say that 'manifestation' means
the taking of a present condition by means of rejecting an unarrived
\[or future,\] condition, then this is our dogma of the reality of
products \[[Book I., § 115](sak1.htm#pp_115.md)\]; and *such* an eternity
belongs to *all* products, \[not specially to Sound\]; so that you are
proving the already proved \[or conceded\]: such is the meaning. And, if
'manifestation' is asserted to be just in the shape of the cognition of
what is presently real, then we should find \[on your theory,\] that
jars, &c., also, are eternal; because it would be proper \[on that
theory,\] that the object in the perception of production, by the
operation of the causes \[the potter, &c.\], should be that of
*knowledge* only, as in the case of words, &c., and also in the case of
jars, &c.; \[for the jar is *shown* by the lamp, not made by it\]. Such
is the import.<span id="page_362_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_362_note_3.md)

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

   <span id="pp_60b"></span>*b*. An objection to the non-duality of
Soul, not previously mentioned, is to be adduced; therefore the
refutation of the non-duality of Soul is recommenced, \[having been
already handled under [Book I., § 149](sak1.htm#pp_149.md)\].

 

|                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Non-duality of Soul denied on grounds of Inference.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_61"></span>*Aph*. 61.[\*](#pp_61.md) Non-duality of
Soul<span id="page_363_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_363_note_2.md) is not; for
its distinctions are cognized through signs.

   <span id="pp_61a"></span>*a*. That is to say: because it is proved to
be really different \[in different persons\], by the sign that *one*
quits Nature \[or escapes from the mundane condition\], while another
not does quit it, &c.

   <span id="pp_61b"></span>*b*. But, he tells us, there is even
sense-evidence destructive of the non-distinction of Soul from things
\[that are\] non-Soul, asserted in the Scriptural texts, 'All this is
Soul only,'<span id="page_363_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_363_note_4.md) 'All

| <span class="small">*   Non-duality denied on grounds of Sense.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_62"></span>*Aph*. 62.[\*](#pp_62.md) Moreover, there is not
\[non-distinction of Soul\] from non-Soul; because this is disproved by
sense-evidence.

   <span id="pp_62a"></span>*a*. That is to say: moreover, there is
*not* a non-distinction between the non-Soul, i.e., the aggregate of the
experienceable, and Soul; because this is excluded also by
sense-evidence, \[as well as by signs, ([§ 61](#pp_61).md)\]; because, if
Soul were not other than the whole perceptible, it would also not be
different from a jar and a web; since the jar, e.g., would not be other
than the web, which \[by hypothesis,\] is not other than the Soul: and
*this* is excluded by sense-evidence, which constrains us to apprehend a
distinction \[between a jar and a web\].

   <span id="pp_62b"></span>*b*. In order to clear the minds of
learners, he illustrates this point, though already established:

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The reasons combined.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_63"></span>*Aph*. 63.[\*](#pp_63.md) Not between the two
\[Soul and non-Soul, is there non-difference\]; for that same \[couple
of reasons\].

   <span id="pp_63a"></span>*a*. 'Between the two,' i.e., between Soul
and non-Soul, the two together, also, there is not an absolute
non-difference; <span id="page_365">p. 365</span> for the couple of
reaaons \[given in [§ 61](#pp_61) and [§ 62](#pp_62.md)\]: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_63b"></span>*b*. But then, in that case, what is the
drift of such Scriptural texts as, '\[All\] this is Soul only?' To this
he replies:

 

|                                                                                                 |

   <span id="pp_64a"></span>*a*. That is to say: 'in respect of the
undiscriminating,' with reference to undiscriminating persons, in the
case or non-difference \[between Soul and non-Soul, apparently asserted
in Scripture\], it is 'there for the sake of something else;' i.e., the
observation<span id="page_365_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_365_note_3.md) is
\[designed to be\] provocative of worship. For, in the secular world,
through want of discrimination, body and the embodied, the experienced
and the experiencer, are regarded as indifferent; <span id="page_366">p.

   <span id="pp_64b"></span>*b*. He declares, that, according to the

Ignorance,<span id="page_366_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_366_note_2.md) nor
both, can be the material cause of the world; because of the
solitariness of \[Soul\].

   <span id="pp_65a"></span>*a*. The soul alone, or Ignorance lodged in
the soul, or both together, like a pair of jar-halves \[conjoined in the
formation of a jar\], cannot be the material of the world; 'because of
the *solitariness*' of Soul. For things undergo alteration only through
that particular conjunction <span id="page_367">p. 367</span> which is
called 'association;' hence the \[ever\] solitary Soul, without a
second, since it is not associated, cannot serve as a material cause.
Nor can it do so by means of \[association with\] Ignorance, either;
because the conjunction of Ignorance has been already excluded by the
fact of *solitariness*. Moreover, that the two together should be the
material is impossible, even as it is that either, severally, should be
the material; simply 'because of the solitariness.' Such is the meaning.
And, if you choose that Ignorance should subsist as a substance located
in the soul, as the air in the heavens, then there is an abandonment of
the non-duality of Soul, \[for which you Vedántís contend\].

   <span id="pp_65b"></span>*b*. He himself \[in [Book I., §
145](sak1.htm#pp_145.md)\] decided that the soul consists of light, \[or
knowledge\]. In regard to this, he repels the primâ facie view, founded
on the text, 'Brahma <span id="page_368">p. 368</span> is reality,
knowledge, and joy,'<span
id="page_368_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_368_note_1.md) that the essence of the
soul is *joy*, also:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul not joy and knowledge, both.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_66"></span>*Aph*. 66.[\*](#pp_66.md) The two natures, joy
and knowledge do not belong to *one*; because the two are different.

   <span id="pp_66a"></span>*a*. A single subject has not the nature
both of joy and of intelligence; because, since pleasure is not
experienced at the time of knowing pain, pleasure and knowledge are
different: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_66b"></span>*b*. But then, in that case, what becomes of
the Scripture, that it \[Soul,\] consists of joy? To this he replies:

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A Vedánta term explained away.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_67"></span>*Aph*. 67.[\*](#pp_67.md) Metaphorical \[is the
word joy, in the sense\] of the cessation of pain.

   <span id="pp_67a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the word 'joy,' in the
Scriptural expression which means, really, the cessation of pain, is
metaphorical. This is stated in \[the maxim\], 'Pleasure is the
departure of both pain and pleasure.'

   <span id="pp_67b"></span>*b*. He states the cause of this
metaphorical employment:

 

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why the term was used in a sense not literal.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_68"></span>*Aph*. 68.[\*](#pp_68.md) It is \[as\] a
*laudation* of emancipation, for the sake of the dull.

   <span id="pp_68a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the Scripture, as an
incitement to 'the dull,' i.e., the ignorant, lauds, as if it were
*joy*, the emancipation, consisting in the cessation of pain, which
\[cessation\] is the essence of the soul;<span
id="page_369_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_369_note_4.md) \[for the soul is such
joy as consists of the absence of pain\].

   <span id="pp_68b"></span>*b*. In order to manifest immediately the
origin, already <span id="page_370">p. 370</span> declared,<span
id="page_370_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_370_note_1.md) of the internal organ,
he repels the primâ facie view, that the Mind is all-pervading.

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Mind not all-pervading.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_69"></span>*Aph*. 69.[\*](#pp_69.md) The Mind is not
all-pervading; because it is an instrument, and because it is, moreover,
an *organ*.

   <span id="pp_69a"></span>*a*. The Mind, meaning the totality of the
internal instruments,<span
id="page_370_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_370_note_4.md) is not all-pervading;
for it is an instrument, as an axe, or the like, is. The word 'and'
\[literally, 'or,' in the Aphorism,\] implies a distributive
alternative, \[not an optional one\]. The meaning is this, that, \[while
the whole of the internal instruments are *instruments*,\] the
particular internal instrument, the third<span
id="page_370_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_370_note_5.md) \[the Mind, *manas*<span
id="page_370_fr_6"></span>[6](#page_370_note_6.md)\]. <span
id="page_371">p. 371</span> is not all-pervading; because *it* is,
moreover, an *organ*.<span
id="page_371_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_371_note_1.md) But knowledge, &c.,
pervading the body, are demonstrable as only of medium extent, \[neither
infinite nor atomic\].

   <span id="pp_69b"></span>*b*. Here, there being a doubt whether this
be convincing, he propounds an appropriate confutation:

 

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Proof of this.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_70"></span>*Aph*. 70.[\*](#pp_70.md) \[The Mind is not
all-pervading\]; for it is moveable; since there is Scripture regarding
the motion.

   <span id="pp_70a"></span>*a*. That is to say; since, inasmuch as
there is Scripture regarding the *going* of the Soul \[which, being
all-pervading, cannot *go*\] into another world, it being settled that
it is its adjunct, the internal organ, that is movable, \[see [Book I.,
§ 51\]](sak1.htm#pp_51.md), it cannot be all-pervading.

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

   <span id="pp_70b"></span>*b*. In order to prove that it is a product,
he repels also the opinion that the Mind is without parts:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Mind has no parts.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_71"></span>*Aph*. 71.[\*](#pp_71.md) Like a jar, it \[the
Mind,\] is not without parts; because it comes in contact therewith,
\[i.e., with several Senses, simultaneously\].

   <span id="pp_71a"></span>*a*. The word 'therewith' refers to 'organ,'
which occurs in a preceding aphorism, \[[§ 69](#pp_69.md)\]. The Mind is
not without parts; 'because it comes in contact,' simultaneously, with
several sense-organs. But, 'like a jar,' it is of medium size, \[neither
infinite nor atomic\], and consists of parts. Such is the meaning. And
it is to be understood that the internal organ, when in the state of a
*cause*, \[and not modified and expanded, e.g., into knowledge, which is
its product,\] *is*, indeed, atomic.

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

   <span id="pp_71b"></span>*b*. He demurs to the eternity of Mind,
Time, &c:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Eternity belongs to what.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_72"></span>*Aph*. 72.[\*](#pp_72.md) Everything except
Nature and Soul is uneternal.

   <span id="pp_72a"></span>*a*. \[This is\] plain. And the Mind,<span
id="page_373_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_373_note_2.md) the Ether, &c., when in
the state of *cause*, \[not developed into product\], are called
*Nature*, and not Intellect,<span
id="page_373_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_373_note_3.md) &c., by reason of the
absence of the special properties, viz., judgment,<span
id="page_373_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_373_note_4.md) &c.

   <span id="pp_72b"></span>*b*. But then, according to such Scriptural
texts as, 'He should know Illusion to be Nature, and him in whom is
Illusion to be the great Lord, and this whole world to be pervaded by
portions of him,'<span id="page_373_fr_6"></span>[6](#page_373_note_6.md)
since Soul and Nature, <span id="page_374">p. 374</span> also, are made
up of parts, they must be uneternal. To this he replies:

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul and Nature not made up of parts.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_73"></span>*Aph*. 73.[\*](#pp_73.md) No parts \[from the
presence of which in the discerptible, one might infer
destructibility,\] are found in the Experiencer; for there is Scripture
for its being without parts.

   <span id="pp_73a"></span>*a*. Parts are not appropriate to 'the
Experiencer,' i.e., to Soul, or to Nature; for there is Scripture for
their being without parts; that is to say, because of such \[texts\] as,
'Without parts, motioniess, quiescent, unobjectionable,
passionless.'<span id="page_375_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_375_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_73b"></span>*b*. It has been stated \[in [Book I., §
1](sak1.htm#pp_1.md),\] that Emancipation is the cessation of pain. In
order to corroborate this, he then repels the doctrines of others, in
regard to Emancipation:

 

|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A view of Emancipation disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_74"></span>*Aph*. 74.[\*](#pp_74.md) Emancipation is not a
manifestation of joy; because there <span id="page_376">p. 376</span>
are no *properties* \[in Soul, as, e.g., in the shape of joy\].

   <span id="pp_74a"></span>*a*. There belongs to Soul no *property* in
the shape of joy, or in the shape of manifestation; and the *essence*
\[of Soul\] is quite eternal, and, therefore, not something to be
produced by means: therefore, Emancipation is not a manifestation of
joy: such is the meaning.

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Second view disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_75"></span>*Aph*. 75.[\*](#pp_75.md) Nor, in like manner,
is it \[Emancipation,\] the destruction of special qualities.

   <span id="pp_75a"></span>*a*. Emancipation is, moreover, not the
destruction of all special qualities, 'In like manner.' Because there
are absolutely *no* properties \[in Soul, (see [§ 74](#pp_74).md)\]. Such
is the meaning.

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A third view disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_76"></span>*Aph*. 76.[\*](#pp_76.md) Nor is it
\[Emancipation,\] any particular going of that \[Soul,\] which is
motionless.

   <span id="pp_76a"></span>*a*. Moreover, emancipation is not a going
to the world <span id="page_377">p. 377</span> of Brahmá;<span
id="page_377_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_377_note_1.md) because the Soul, since
it is motionless, does not *go*.

|---------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A fourth view disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_77"></span>*Aph*. 77.[\*](#pp_77.md) Nor is it
\[Emancipation,\] the destruction of the influence of \[intellectual\]
forms, by reason of the faults of momentariness, &c.

   <span id="pp_77a"></span>*a*. The meaning is, that also the doctrine
of the Nihilist, that the Soul consists merely of momentary knowledge,
that Bondage is the modifying thereof by objects, and that emancipation
is the destruction of the influence thereof called Memory,<span
id="page_377_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_377_note_3.md) is inadmissible;
because, by reason of the faults of *momentariness*, &c., \[such\]
emancipation is not the Soul's aim.

   <span id="pp_77b"></span>*b*. He censures another \[conception of\]
emancipation of the Nihilist's:

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A fifth view disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_78"></span>*Aph*. 78.[\*](#pp_78.md) Nor is it
\[Emancipation,\] destruction of all; for this has, among other things,
the fault of *not* being the soul's aim.

   <span id="pp_78a"></span>*a*. Likewise, the entire destruction of the
Soul, which consists of knowledge, is not emancipation; because, among
other things, we do not see, in the world, that the annihilation of the
soul is the soul's aim: such is the meaning.

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A sixth view disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_79"></span>*Aph*. 79.[\*](#pp_79.md) So, too, the Void.

   <span id="pp_79a"></span>*a*. The annihilation of the whole universe,
consisting of cognition and the cognizable, is, thus, also, not
emancipation; because Soul's aim is not effected by Soul's annihilation:
such is the meaning.

 

|                                                          |

| <span class="small">*   A seventh view disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_80"></span>*Aph*. 80.[\*](#pp_80.md) And conjunctions

acquisition of lands, &c., either.

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

   <span id="pp_80a"></span>*a*. From its perishableness, possessorship
is not Emancipation.

| <span class="small">*   An eighth view disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_81"></span>*Aph*. 81.[\*](#pp_81.md) Nor is it
\[Emancipation,\] conjunction of a Part with the Whole.

   <span id="pp_81a"></span>*a*. Emancipation is not absorption of 'a
Part,' i.e., the Soul, into 'the Whole,' i.e., that of which it is \[on
the view in question,\] a part, viz., the Supreme Soul; for the reason
assigned \[in [§ 80](#pp_80.md)\], viz., 'conjunctions terminate in
separations,' and because we do not admit a Lord \[[Book I., §
92](sak1.htm#pp_92.md)\], and because, thus, self-dissolution is not Soul's
aim: such is the meaning.

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

| <span class="small">*   A ninth view disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_82"></span>*Aph*. 82.[\*](#pp_82.md) Nor is it
\[Emancipation\], moreover, conjunction with the \[power of\] becoming
as small as an atom, &c.; since, as is the case with other conjunctions,
the destruction of this must necessarily take place.

   <span id="pp_82a"></span>*a*. Moreover, conjunction with superhuman
power, e.g., the assuming the size of an atom, is not Emancipation;
because, just as is the case with connexions with other superhuman
powers, the destruction of this, also, follows, of necessity: such is
the meaning.

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A tenth view disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_83"></span>*Aph*. 83.[\*](#pp_83.md) Nor, just as in that
case, is it \[Emancipation\], moreover, conjunction with the rank of
Indra, &c.

   <span id="pp_83a"></span>*a*. Nor is the attainment of the superhuman
power of Indra, &c., Emancipation,—just as is the case with other
superhuman powers \[such as assuming atomic bulk\];—by reason of
perishableness: such is the meaning.

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

   <span id="pp_83b"></span>*b*. He repels the objection of an opponent
to what has been stated \[in [Book I., § 61](sak1.htm#pp_61.md)\], that the
Organs are products of Self-consciousness:

 

|                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The organs whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_84"></span>*Aph*. 84.[\*](#pp_84.md) The Organs are not
formed of the Elements \[as the *Naiyáyikas* assert\]; because there is
Scripture for their being derived from Self-consciousness.

   <span id="pp_84a"></span>*a*. With advertence to the opinion that
*Power*, &c., also, are principles, he repels the determination of
categories \[insisted upon by the various sects\] of his opponents, and
the notion that Emancipation comes through a knowledge of these
\[categories\] merely:

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

 

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The categories of the Vaiśeshika objected to.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_85"></span>*Aph*. 85.[\*](#pp_85.md) The rule of six
categories is not \[the correct one\]; nor does Emancipation result from
acquaintance therewith, \[as the *Vaiśeshikas* maintain\].

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   And those of the Nyáya, &c.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_86"></span>*Aph*. 86.[\*](#pp_86.md) So, too, is it in the
case of the sixteen \[categories of the *Nyáya*\], &c.

   <span id="pp_86a"></span>*a*. In order to establish, what has been
already stated \[in [Book I., § 62](sak1.htm#pp_62.md)\], that the five
Elements are *products*, he rejects the eternity of the Earthy and other
Atoms, which is held by the *Vaiśeshikas* and others:

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The eternity of Atoms unscriptural.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_87"></span>*Aph*. 87.[\*](#pp_87.md) \[The five Elements
being *products*, as declared in [Book I., § 61](sak1.htm#pp_61.md)\],
Atoms are not eternal, \[as alleged in the *Nyáya*\]; for there is
Scripture for their being products.

   <span id="pp_87a"></span>*a*. Although that text of Scripture is not
seen by us, because it has disappeared, in the lapse of time, &c., yet,
it is to be inferred from the words of teachers, and from the tradition
of Manu, \[Ch. I., v. 27\].

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

   <span id="pp_87b"></span>*b*. But then, how can an Atom, which is
without parts, be a product? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Scripture decisive of the question.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_88"></span>*Aph*. 88.[\*](#pp_88.md) Since it is a product,
it is not without parts.

   <span id="pp_88a"></span>*a*. That is to say: since the fact,
established by Scripture, of their being products, cannot be otherwise
accounted for, the \[so-called\] Atoms of Earth, &c., are *not* without
parts.

   <span id="pp_88b"></span>*b*. He repels the objection of the
Nihilist, that direct cognition of Nature, or of Soul, is impossible;
because \[forsooth,\] the cause of a thing's being directly cognizable
is colour:

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

 

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A cavil disposed of.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_89"></span>*Aph*. 89.[\*](#pp_89.md) There is no necessity
that direct cognition should have *colour* as its cause.

   <span id="pp_89a"></span>*a*. It is no rule, that to be directly
cognizible should result from colour only, \[or other object of sense\],
as the cause; because direct cognition may result from Merit, &c.,
\[viz., mystical practices, and so forth\], also: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_89b"></span>*b*. Well, if that be the case, pray is the
*dimension* of an Atom a reality, or not? With reference to this, he
decides the question of dimension, \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Dimension of what kinds.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_90"></span>*Aph*. 90.[\*](#pp_90.md) There are not four
varieties of dimension; because those can be accounted for by two.

   <span id="pp_90a"></span>*a*. There are not four kinds of dimension,
viz., small, great, long, and short; but there are only two sorts.
'Because those can be accounted for by two:' that is to say, the four
varieties can be accounted for by merely two, the atomic \[or
*positively* small,\] and the great. Such is the meaning. For the short
and the long are merely subordinate kinds of the dimension called great;
else we should have, e.g., no end of dimensions, in the shape of the
crooked, &c.

   <span id="pp_90b"></span>*b*. He rebuts the Nihilist's denial of
genera, \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Genus proved by recognition.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_91"></span>*Aph*. 91.[\*](#pp_91.md) Though these
\[individuals\] be uneternal, recognition, as being associated with
constancy, is of genus.

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

   <span id="pp_91a"></span>*a*. Hence, he says, it is not proper to
deny \[the existence\] of genus:

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   And not to be denied.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_92"></span>*Aph*. 92.[\*](#pp_92.md) Therefore it
\[genus,\] is not to be denied.

   <span id="pp_92a"></span>*a*. But then \[it may be said\],
recognition is to be accounted for simply by a *non-existence*, in the
shape of the exclusion of what is not the thing \[recognized\]: and let
*this* be what is meant by the word 'genus.' To this he replies:

 

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Genus positive, not negative.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_93"></span>*Aph*. 93.[\*](#pp_93.md) It \[genus,\] does not
consist in *exclusion* of something else; because it is cognized as an
entity.

   <span id="pp_93a"></span>*a*. That is to say: genus does not consist
in exclusion \[of something else\]; because 'This is that same' is the
cognition of something *positive*; for, otherwise, the only thing
cognized would be, 'This is not a non-jar.'

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

   <span id="pp_93b"></span>*b*. But still, recognition may be caused by
*likeness*. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Likewise not a distinct principle.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_94"></span>*Aph*. 94.[\*](#pp_94.md) Likeness is not a
separate principle; for it is directly apprehended, \[as one
manifestation of Community\].

   <span id="pp_94a"></span>*a*. That is to say: likeness is nothing
other than sameness in many parts, &c.; for it is directly apprehended
as consisting in sameness; \[the *likeness* of a fair face to the moon,
e.g., consisting in the *sameness* of the pleasurable feeling, &c.,
occasioned by the sight of either\].

   <span id="pp_94b"></span>*b*. The conjecture, 'But then, let likeness
be really an inherent power, and not \[a modified aspect of\]
Community,' he repels:

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nor a peculiar power.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_95"></span>*Aph*. 95.[\*](#pp_95.md) Nor is it
\[likeness,\] a manifestation of \[something's\] own power; because the
apprehension of it is different.

   <span id="pp_95a"></span>*a*. Moreover, likeness is not the
manifestation of a particular natural power of a thing; because the
apprehension of likeness is different from the apprehension of power.
For the cognition of a power is not dependent on the cognition of
another thing; the cognition of likeness, on the other hand, is
dependent on the cognition of a correlative,<span
id="page_388_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_388_note_1.md) as is the case with the
cognition of a non-existence; so that the two conceptions are
heterogeneous. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_95b"></span>*b*. But still, let the likeness among
individual jars, &c., be merely that they have \[all alike,\] the name,
e.g., of jar. To this he replies:

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

 

|                                                                            |

| <span class="small">*   Nor the relation between names and things.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_96"></span>*Aph*. 96.[\*](#pp_96.md) Nor, moreover, is it
\[likeness,\] the connexion between name and named.

   <span id="pp_96a"></span>*a*. Because even he who does not know the
connexion between a name and the thing named may cognize a likeness,
\[e.g., between two jars\].

   <span id="pp_96b"></span>*b*. Moreover:

 

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How it cannot be so.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_97"></span>*Aph*. 97.[\*](#pp_97.md) That connexion \[viz.,
between name and named,\] is not eternal; since both \[the
correlatives\] are uneternal.

   <span id="pp_97a"></span>*a*. Since both the name and the named are
uneternal, the relation between them, also, is not eternal. How, then,
can there be, through *that*, the likeness of a departed thing in a
thing present? Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_97b"></span>*b*. But then, though the correlatives be
uneternal, let <span id="page_390">p. 390</span> the *relation* be
eternal. What is to hinder *this*? To this he replies:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another suggestion repelled.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_98"></span>*Aph*. 98.[\*](#pp_98.md) The connexion is not
so \[not eternal\], for this reason, viz., because this is debarred by
the evidence which acquaints us with the thing; \[i.e., the supposition
is inconsistent with the definition of the term\].

   <span id="pp_98a"></span>*a*. *Connexion* is proved only where
*disjunction* incidentally subsists; because, otherwise, there is no
room for the supposition of *connexion*; the case being accounted
for,—as will be explained,—simply by *the natural state of the matter*.
And this incidental disjunction is impossible, if connexion be eternal.
Therefore, connexion is not eternal; for this is debarred by the very
evidence that acquaints us with Connexion. Such is the meaning.

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

   <span id="pp_98b"></span>*b*. But, on this showing, there could be no
such thing as the eternal \[connexion called\] Coinherence<span
id="page_391_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_391_note_1.md) between those two
eternals, a Quality and the thing qualified; \[which Coinherence, or
intimate relation, is one of the categories of the *Nyáya*\]. To this he
replies:

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Category of Intimate Relation rejected.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_99"></span>*Aph*. 99.[\*](#pp_99.md) There is no \[such
thing as\] Coinherence, \[such as the Naiyáyikas insist upon\]; for
there is no evidence \[for it\].

   <span id="pp_99a"></span>*a*. But then \[it may be said\], the
evidence of it is, the perception that something is qualified \[or
conjoined with a quality which inheres in it\], and the
unaccountableness, otherwise, of the cognition of something as
qualified. To this he replies:

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

 

|                                              |
|----------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This argued.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_100"></span>*Aph*. 100.[\*](#pp_100.md) Neither perception
nor inference \[is evidence for the existence of Coinherence\]; since,
as regards both alike, the case is otherwise disposed of.<span
id="page_392_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_392_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_100a"></span>*a*. Since, 'as regards both alike,' i.e.,
the perception of qualifiedness, and the inferring of it, 'the case is
otherwise disposed of;'<span
id="page_392_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_392_note_4.md) viz., simply by *the
natural state* \[of the thing and its qualities\], neither of the two is
evidence for \[the imaginary category called\] Coinherence: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_100b"></span>*b*. It is a tenet, that, from the
agitation of Nature the conjunction of Nature and soul takes place, and
thence results creation. In regard to that, there is this objection of
the atheists, that 'Nothing whatever possesses the action called
agitation; everything is momentary; where <span id="page_393">p.
393</span> it arises, even there it perishes; therefore, no motion is
proved to be inferrible from conjunction \[of anything\] with another
place;' \[the fruit, for instance, which appears to reach the ground not
being that fruit, any longer existent, which appeared to drop from the
tree\]. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Motion is a matter of perception.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_101"></span>*Aph*. 101.[\*](#pp_101.md) Motion is not a
matter of inference; for he who stands very near has, indeed, direct
cognition both of it and of what it belongs to.

   <span id="pp_101a"></span>*a*. In Book Second the different opinions
were merely mentioned, that the Body is formed of five elements, and so
forth; but no particular one was considered. In regard to this question,
he denies the view of an opponent:

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Body is of Earth only.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_102"></span>*Aph*. 102.[\*](#pp_102.md) The Body does not
consist of *five* elements; because many \[heterogeneous things\] are
unsuitable as the material.

   <span id="pp_102a"></span>*a*. He will mention, that, whilst there is
but one material, the material of every Body is earth:

 

|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   There is a Subtile as well as a Gross, Body.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_103"></span>*Aph*. 103.[\*](#pp_103.md) It \[the Body,\] is
not, necessarily, the Gross one; for there is, also, the vehicular
\[transmigrating or Subtile\] one.

   <span id="pp_103a"></span>*a*. Senses, \[the organ of vision, for
example,\] distinct from the eye-balls, have been already mentioned. In
order to substantiate this \[point\], he refutes the opinion, that the
senses reveal what they do not reach to:

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Connexion between sense and object.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_104"></span>*Aph*. 104.[\*](#pp_104.md) The senses do not
reveal what they do not reach to; because of their not reaching, or
because \[else,\] they might reach everything.

   <span id="pp_104a"></span>*a*. The senses do not reveal things
unconnected with them. 'Because of their not reaching.' For we do not
see that lamps, or the like, reveal what they do not reach to; and
because, if they were to reveal what they do not reach to, we should
find them revealing *all* things, viz., those intercepted, and the like.
Such is the meaning. Therefore there is an organ, other than the
eye-ball, for the sake of connexion with the distant sun, &c. Such is
the import. And the instruments reveal the objects simply by delivering
the object to the soul,—for they are, themselves, unintelligent;—as a
mirror reveals the face. Or \[in other words\], their revealing an
object is simply their taking up an image of the object.

   <span id="pp_104b"></span>*b*. He repels the conjecture: But then, in
that case, the opinion \[of the Naiyáyikas,\] that the sight is luminous
<span id="page_396">p. 396</span> is quite right; for we see Light alone
glide rapidly to a distance, in the form of rays:

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Sight not formed of Light.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_105"></span>*Aph*. 105.[\*](#pp_105.md) Not because Light
glides \[and the Sight does so, too,\] is the Sight luminous \[or formed
of Light\]; because the thing is accounted for by \[the theory of\]
modifications, \[to be now explained\].

   <span id="pp_105a"></span>*a*. The Sight is not to be asserted to be
luminous, on the ground that light is seen to glide. Why? Because, just
as in the case of the vital air, where there is no luminosity, the
gliding forth can be accounted for through a kind of modification. Such
is the meaning. For, as the vital air, without having at all parted from
the body, glides out ever so far from the end of the nose, under the
modification called breathing, \[and thus smells a distant flower\],
just so the Sight, though a non-luminous substance, without, indeed,
quitting \[connexion with\] the body, all in a moment will dart off
\[like the protruded feeler of a polyp,\] to a distant object, such as
the sun, by means of the species of change called modification.

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

   <span id="pp_105b"></span>*b*. But what is the proof that there is
any such modification? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Proof of his theory of vision, that it accounts for the phenomena.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_106"></span>*Aph*. 106.[\*](#pp_106.md) By the sign of the
display of the attained object the \[existence of the\] modification
\[which could alone account for that display,\] is proved.

   <span id="pp_106a"></span>*a*. He shows \[us\] the nature of the
modification, to account for the going, though without parting from the
Body:

 

|                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Of the theory, further.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_107"></span>*Aph*. 107.[\*](#pp_107.md) The 'modification'
is another principle than a fragment, or <span id="page_398">p.
398</span> a quality, \[of the Sight, or other sense\]; because it is
for the sake of *connexion* that it glides forth.

   <span id="pp_107a"></span>*a*. The modification is not a *fragment*
of the Sight, or other sense, \[serving as\] the cause of the revealing
of objects,—a part disjoined like a spark,—or a *quality*, like, e.g.,
Colour; but the modification, whilst a portion thereof, is something
else than a fragment, or a quality. For, if there were disruption,
connexion of the sun, &c., with the Sight would not, through it, take
place; and, if it were a quality, the motion called 'gliding forth'
would be unaccountable; \[for a quality cannot move by itself\]. Such is
the meaning.

   <span id="pp_107b"></span>*b*. But, if, thus, the 'modifications' are
*substances*, how is \[the term\] 'modification' applied to the
*qualities* of intellect, in the shape of Desire, &c.? To this he
replies:

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

 

|                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   'Modifications' may be qualities, as well as substances.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_108"></span>*Aph*. 108.[\*](#pp_108.md) It \[the term
'modification,'\] is not confined to substances; because it is
etymological, \[not technical, and applies, etymologically, to a
quality, as well\].

   <span id="pp_108a"></span>*a*. Since it is also stated, in Scripture,
that the sense-organs are formed of the Elements, the doubt may occur,
whether the Scriptural texts are, perhaps, to be applied distributively,
according to the difference of particular worlds. In regard to this, he
says:

 

|                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The materials of the organs everywhere the same.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_109"></span>*Aph*. 109.[\*](#pp_109.md) Not though there be
a difference of locality, is there a difference in the material \[of
which the organs are formed\]: the rule is as with the like of us.

   <span id="pp_109a"></span>*a*. Not through 'difference of locality,'
as the world of Brahmá, and the like, is it, again, the fact, that the
organs have any other material than self-consciousness; but the rule is,
that those of all alike are formed of self-consciousness; as is the
case, e.g., with us who live in this terrestrial world. For we hear, in
Scripture, of only one Subtile Body <span id="page_400">p. 400</span>
\[made up of the organs\], transmigrating generally throngh the
different localities. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_109b"></span>*b*. But then, in that case, how is the
Scripture relating to the materiality \[of the organs\] to be accounted
for? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A non-literal text accounted for.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_110"></span>*Aph*. 110.[\*](#pp_110.md) The mention thereof
\[viz., of materiality, as if it belonged to the organs,\] is because
there is \[intended to be made, thereby, a more emphatic\] mention of
the concomitant cause.<span
id="page_400_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_400_note_4.md)

   <span id="pp_110a"></span>*a*. There is designation as the material
cause, in the case even where the cause is \[but\] concomitant, with a
<span id="page_401">p. 401</span> view to indicating its *importance*;
just as fire is \[spoken of as a rising\] from fuel, \[which fuel is a
necessary concomitant of, though not really the substance of, the
fire\]. Hence are they \[the organs,\] spoken of as being formed of the
Elements. Such is the meaning. For, only in reliance on the support of
Light, or other Element, do the Organs, viz., the Sight, &c., \[formed\]
from the accompanying Self-consciousness, come to exist; as fire, in
reliance on the support of earthly fuel, results from the attendant
Light, \[or Heat, which cannot manifest itself alone\].

   <span id="pp_110b"></span>*b*. As the subject presents itself, he
determines the variety that belongs to Gross Body:

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Varieties of Gross Bodies.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_111"></span>*Aph*. 111.[\*](#pp_111.md) The heat-born,
egg-born, womb-born, vegetable, thought-born, and spell-born; such is
not an exhaustive division \[of Gross Body, though a rough and customary
one\].

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

   <span id="pp_111a"></span>*a*. It was stated, before, that Body has
only one Element as its material. In this same connexion, he observes
discriminatively, as follows:

 

|                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The material of Bodies.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_112"></span>*Aph*. 112.[\*](#pp_112.md) In all \[Bodies\]
Earth is the material: in consideration \[however,\] of some speciality,
there is designation as this \[or that other element than earth, as
entering into the constitution of some given body\], as in the preceding
case \[treated under [§ 110](#pp_110.md)\].

   <span id="pp_112a"></span>*a*. In all Bodies the material is Earth
only. 'In consideration of some speciality;' i.e., in consequence of
intensity through excess, &c., in the case of Body, as before \[in the
case of the Organs\], there is, however, designation as consisting of
Elements, five, or four, &c., on the ground only of there being a
*support*, as in the case of the materiality of the Organs. Such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_112b"></span>*b*. But then, since the vital air is the
principal thing in <span id="page_403">p. 403</span> the Body, let the
vital air itself be the originant of the Body. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The vital air not the source of the Body.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_113"></span>*Aph*. 113.[\*](#pp_113.md) The vital air is
not \[on the allegation that it is the principal thing in the Body, to
be considered\] the originant of the Body; because it \[the vital air,
or spirit,\] subsists through the power of the organs.

   <span id="pp_113a"></span>*a*. The vital air, consisting in the
function of the organs, does not subsist in the absence of the organs.
Therefore, since, in a *dead* Body, in consequence of the absence of the
organs, there is the absence of the vital air, the vital air is not the
originant of the Body.

   <span id="pp_113b"></span>*b*. But then, in that case, since the
vital air is not the cause of the Body, the Body might come into
existence even without the vital air. To this he replies:

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

 

|                                                                 |

\[literally, that which has the vital airs\], is 'the construction of
the site of experience,' i.e., the Body; because, 'otherwise,' i.e., if
the operation of the vital airs were absent, we should find putrefaction
in the semen and blood, just as in a dead body. Such is the meaning. And
thus, by the several operations of circulating the juices, &c., the
vital air is a *concomitant* cause<span
id="page_404_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_404_note_2.md) of the Body, through the
sustaining of it: such is the import.

   <span id="pp_114b"></span>*b*. But then \[it may be said\], it is
only the vital air, itself, that can be the superintender; because it is
this which <span id="page_405">p. 405</span> operates, not the Soul,
since *it* is motoinless, and since there is no use in the
superintendence of what does not operate. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                         |

   <span id="pp_115"></span>*Aph*. 115.[\*](#pp_115.md) Through a servant,
not directly, is superintendence \[exercised\] by the master.

   <span id="pp_115a"></span>*a*. In the construction of the Body,
'superintendence,' in the shape of energizing, is not 'directly,' i.e.,
immediately, \[exercised\] 'by the master,' i.e., by Soul, but 'through
its servant,' in the shape of the vital airs; as in the case of a king's
building a city: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_115b"></span>*b*. It was stated before \[[Book II., §
1](sak2.htm#pp_1.md),\] that Nature's \[agency\] is 'for the emancipation
of what is \[really, though not apparently,\] emancipated.' In reference
to the objection of opponents in regard to this, viz., 'How can the
<span id="page_406">p. 406</span> soul be eternally free, when we see it
bound?' with a view to demonstrating its eternal freedom, he says:

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul ever free.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_116"></span>*Aph*. 116.[\*](#pp_116.md) In Concentration,
profound sleep, and emancipation, it \[Soul,\] consists of Brahma.<span
id="page_406_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_406_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_116a"></span>*a*. Then what is the difference of
emancipation from profound sleep and concentration? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                     |

   <span id="pp_117"></span>*Aph*. 117.[\*](#pp_117.md) In the case of the
two, it is with a seed; in the case of the other, this is wanting.

   <span id="pp_117a"></span>*a*. 'In the case of the two,' viz.,
concentration and profound sleep, the identity with Brahma<span
id="page_406_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_406_note_5.md) is 'with a seed,' i.e.,
associated with some cause of Bondage, \[or reappearance in the mundane
state\]; 'in the case of the other,' i.e., <span id="page_407">p.
407</span> in emancipation, this cause is absent: this is the
distinction. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_117b"></span>*b*. But then, Concentration and profound
sleep are *evident*: but what evidence is there of *Emancipation*? This
objection of the atheist he repels:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The reality of Emancipation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_118"></span>*Aph*. 118.[\*](#pp_118.md) But there are not
the two \[only\]; because the triad, also \[Emancipation inclusive\], is
evident; as are the two.

   <span id="pp_118a"></span>*a*. The meaning is, that, since
Emancipation, also, is 'evident,' i.e., is inferrible, through the
example of Concentration and profound sleep, there are not the two,
viz., profound sleep and Concentration, only; but Emancipation, also,
really is. And the argument is thus. The quitting of that identity with
Brahma<span id="page_407_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_407_note_4.md) which
\[identity\] exists during profound sleep, &c., takes place only through
a fault, viz., Desire, or the like, lodged in the mind; and, if this
fault be annihilated by knowledge, then there results <span
id="page_408">p. 408</span> a *permanent* condition, quite similar to
profound sleep, &c.; and it is precisely *this* that is
Emancipation.<span id="page_408_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_408_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_118b"></span>*b*. But then \[suggests some one, with
reference to [§ 117](#pp_117.md)\], granting, that, even notwithstanding
the existence of the 'seed' \[or source of return to the mundane
state,\] called Memory,<span
id="page_408_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_408_note_3.md) a mental modification
after the form of any object does not arise during *concentration*,
inasmuch as Memory is \[then\] dulled \[or deadened\] by apathy, &c.,
yet, in the case of a person in *profound sleep*, since Memory prevails,
there will really be cognition of objects; consequently, it is not
proper to say that there is identity with Brahma during profound sleep.
To this he replies:

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Memory inactive during profound sleep.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_119"></span>*Aph*. 119.[\*](#pp_119.md) There is not the
revelation, by memory, of an object likewise during the conjunction of a
\[more potent\] fault \[such as sleep\]: the secondary cause does not
debar the principal.<span
id="page_409_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_409_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_119a"></span>*a*. As in the case of apathy, so, also
when there is the conjunction of the fault of sleep, Memory does not
reveal its own objects, does not remind us of its objects; for the
'secondary,' the subordinate, Memory,<span
id="page_409_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_409_note_3.md) cannot defeat the <span
id="page_410">p. 410</span> more potent fault of Sleep: such is the
meaning. For the really more potent fault makes the memory powerless,
incompetent to produce its effects; \[and so there is nothing, in this,
to prevent identification of Soul with Brahma, during profound sleep,
any more than during apathetic Concentration\]: such is the import.

   <span id="pp_119b"></span>*b*. It was stated, in the Third Book \[[§
83](sak3.htm#pp_83.md)\], that the retention of a Body by him who is
emancipated while still living, is 'in consequenue of a mere vestige of
impression.'<span id="page_410_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_410_note_2.md) To
this it is objected as follows. Experience is observed, in the case of
the \[alleged person\] emancipated during life, just as in the case of
the like of us, \[and this experience continuous,\] even though it may
be constantly in respect of a single object: now, this is unaccountable
\[on the hypothesis of his really *being* emancipated\]; because the
antecedent *impression* is annihilated, exactly on its having produced
the first \[instant of\] experience, and because no subsequent
impression arises, inasmuch as *knowledge* debars it; just as is the
case with Merit. To this he replies:

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

 

|                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An objection met to the possibility of emancipation in one still living.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_120"></span>*Aph*. 120.[\*](#pp_120.md) A single impression
\[suffices to generate, and\] lasts out<span
id="page_411_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_411_note_2.md) the experience: but
there are not different impressions, one to each \[instant of\]
experience; else, we should have a postulation of many, \[where a single
one may suffice\].

   <span id="pp_120a"></span>*a*. In like manner, in the case of the
whirling of the potter's wheel, the self-continuant principle,<span
id="page_411_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_411_note_3.md) called motal inertia, is
to be regarded as only one, continuing till the completion of the
whirling.

   <span id="pp_120b"></span>*b*. It has been stated \[[§
111](#pp_111.md),\] that there are vegetable Bodies. He repels the
objection of the atheist, that, in the case in question, there is not a
*Body*, inasmuch as there is no knowledge of the external:

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Vegetable organism really a Body.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_121"></span>*Aph*. 121.[\*](#pp_121.md) Knowledge of the
external is not indispensable \[to constitute a Body\]:<span
id="page_412_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_412_note_1.md) trees, shrubs, climbers,
annuals, trees with invisible flowers, grasses, creepers, &c., \[which
have internal consciousness\], are, also, sites of experiencer and
experience; as in the former case.

   <span id="pp_121a"></span>*a*. There is no necessity that that only
should be a Body, in which there is knowledge of the external; but it is
to be held that the being a Body, in the form of being the site of
experiencer and experience, belongs also to trees, &c., which have
internal consciousness; because, 'as in the former case,' meaning the
putrescence already mentioned \[see [§ 114](#pp_114.md)\], of the Bodies of
men, &c., \[which takes place\] in the absence of the superintendence of
an experiencer \[the living soul\], even in the same way do withering,
&c., take place in the Bodies of trees, &c., also: such is the meaning.
And to this effect there is Scripture.

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

 

|                                                                                   |

| <span class="small">*   Law, as well as Scripture, is authority for this.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_122"></span>*Aph*. 122.[\*](#pp_122.md) And from the Legal
Institutes \[the same fact may be inferred, viz., that vegetables have
bodies and are conscious\].<span
id="page_413_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_413_note_1.md)

   <span id="pp_122a"></span>*a*. But then, from the fact that trees,
&c., also, are thus conscious, we should find merit and demerit accruing
to them. To this he replies:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Vegetables not moral agents.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_123"></span>*Aph*. 123.[\*](#pp_123.md) Not merely through
a Body is there susceptibility of Merit and Demerit; for Scripture tells
us the distinction.

   <span id="pp_123a"></span>*a*. The vital spirit is not liable to the
production of Merit and Demerit through a *Body* merely. Why? 'For
Scripture tells us the distinction:' because we are told, in Scripture,
that the liability results just from the being <span id="page_414">p.
414</span> distinguished by a Brahmanical Body, or the like \[animal
body, not vegetable\]. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_123b"></span>*b*. Showing that the liability to Merit
and Demerit is solely through the *kind* of Body, he mentions how Body
is of three kinds:

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Body of three principal kinds.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_124"></span>*Aph*. 124.[\*](#pp_124.md) Among the three
there is a threefold distribution; the Body of merit, the Body of
experience, and the Body of both.

   <span id="pp_124a"></span>*a*. There is a threefold distribution of
Body 'among the three,' i.e., among those highest, lowest, and
intermediate,—all living beings,—viz., the Body of merit, the Body of
experience, and the Body of both: such is the meaning. Of these, a Body
of merit belongs to the preeminent sages; a Body of experience, to Indra
and others, and to things immovable, &c.; and a Body of both, to the
royal sages. Here the division is \[not exhaustive, but\] into three,
because of the preeminence \[of these\]; for, <span id="page_415">p.
415</span> otherwise, we should have all alike possessed of a Body of
experience, \[like Indra\].

   <span id="pp_124b"></span>*b*. He mentions also a fourth Body:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A fourth kind of Body.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_125"></span>*Aph*. 125.[\*](#pp_125.md) Not any one \[of
these\], moreover, is that of the apathetic.

   <span id="pp_125a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the Body which belongs
to the ascetics is different from all these three; such as was that of
Dattátreya, Jaḍabharata, and others; for they possessed bodies
consisting of mere knowledge.

   <span id="pp_125b"></span>*b*. In order to establish the
non-existence of a Lord, which was stated before, he disproves the
eternity of <span id="page_416">p. 416</span> knowledge, desire, action,
&c., which is accepted by others \[as existing in the case of the
Lord\]:

 

|                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Argument against the existence of a Lord.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_126"></span>*Aph*. 126.[\*](#pp_126.md) Eternity does not
\[as is alleged by those who wish to establish the existence of a
Lord,\] belong to knowledge,<span
id="page_416_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_416_note_2.md) &c., even in the case of
the particular site, \[viz., that of the supposed Lord\]; as is the case
with fire.

   <span id="pp_126a"></span>*a*. That is to say: just as we infer, from
the example of ordinary fire, that the empyrean fire,<span
id="page_416_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_416_note_3.md) also, is not eternal.

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The argument really ex abundantiâ*</span> |

   <span id="pp_127"></span>*Aph*. 127.[\*](#pp_127.md) And, because the
site \[viz. the supposed Lord\] is unreal, \[it matters not, in the
present instance, whether knowledge, &c.. may be eternal, or not\].

   <span id="pp_127a"></span>*a*. But then, in that case, how can it,
indeed, be possible that there should arise Omniscience, &c., adequate
to the creation of the universe; since we do not behold, in mundane
life, *such* superhuman powers \[though we do see some,\] arising from
penance and the rest \[of the alleged means of acquiring superhuman
powers\]? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The height to which asceticism may elevate.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_128"></span>*Aph*. 128.[\*](#pp_128.md) The superhuman
powers<span id="page_417_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_417_note_2.md) of
concentration, just like the effects of drugs, &c., are not to be
gainsaid.

   <span id="pp_128a"></span>*a*. That is to say: by the example of the
effects of drugs, &c., even the superhuman powers of assuming atomic
magnitude, &c., which result from concentration, and are adapted to the
work of creation, &c., are established.

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

   <span id="pp_128b"></span>*b*. He refutes him who asserts that
Thought belongs to the Elements; since this is hostile to the
establishment \[of the existence\] of Soul:

 

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Argument against Materialism.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_129"></span>*Aph*. 129.[\*](#pp_129.md) Thought does not
belong to the Elements; for it is not found in them separately, or,
moreover, in the state of combination,—or, moreover, in the state of
combination.

   <span id="pp_129a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Thought does not exist
in the five Elements, even when in the state of combination; because we
do not find Thought in them, generally, at the time of disjunction;
\[and there can be nothing in the product which does not preexist in the
cause\].

The 'connexion' in question is the *swarúpa-sambandha*, for which see
Professor Cowell's translation of the *Kusumánjali*, p. 13, note †.

A better reading than the one which Dr. Ballantyne accepted from me is,
certainly, that which omits the clause rendered, 'to the word, the power

in the meaning is the connexion \[intended\].'

*Anuyogin* and *anuyogitá*, as Professor Cowell informs me, are the
opposites of *pratiyogin* and *pratiyogitá*, which latter I would
represent, provisionally, by 'antithetic' and 'antitheticity.'

*Pratiyogin*, a very much commoner technicality than *anuyogin*, occurs
in the comment on [Aph. 95](#pp_95.md) of this Book. It must suffice, here,
to add, that, as I learn from Professor Cowell, the *anuyogin*, <span

an invisible \[originator\] is in question, that \[thing\] in respect of
which there arises the idea of \[its\] being made is \[what is meant
by\] a production by a person.'

Aniruddha, Nágeśa, and Vedánti Mahádeva agree in supplying *kartari*

<span id="page_350_note_3"></span>[3](#page_350_fr_3.md) Instead of
Vijnána's expression, 'the idea of \[its\] being preeeded by
consciousness,' Nágeśa has: 'the idea that \[its\] being made was
preceded by consciousness, i.e., the notion that it was produced
aforethought.

Vedánti Mahádeva impliedly contrasts with a jar, as being a production
of an intelligent and self-conscious maker, a sprout, which originates
as a factor of a series of causes and effects alternating from the time
when vegetation was first evolved. Also see the two aphorisms preceding
the one commented on. *Ed*.

by \[that\] person; since it is not the wont to speak of the respiration
of deep sleep as the production of a person: but, by \[reason of its\]
production consciously, \[a thing is said to be produced by a person\].
The Vedas, however, just like an expiration, and by virtue of desert
\[of souls\], issue, spontaneously, from Brahmá, without ever being
consciously produced \[by him\]. Hence they are not productions of a
person.'

&c., and in a state identical with that of emancipation\]: a cause \[of
desires, &c.; and such is mental impression,\] does not countervail what
is predominant, \[*e.g.*, sleep, which is, as it were, temporary
Brahmahood or emancipation\].'
