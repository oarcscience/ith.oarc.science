## BOOK VI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   H<span class="small">AVING</span> explained, in four Books, all the
matter of the Institute, and having, in the Fifth Book, thoroughly
established it, by refuting the opinions of opponents, now, in a Sixth
Book, he recapitulates the same matter, which is the essence of the
Institute, while condensing it. For, in addition \[to what has
preceded\], an enumeration of the matters before mentioned, namely, a
summary, having been composed, learners acquire an undoubting, accurate,
and more solid knowledge; so that, therefore, reiteration is not here to
be imputed as a fault; because the method is that of fixing a stake,
\[viz., by repeated blows\], and because arguments, &c., not previously
stated, are adduced.

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The existence of Soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_1"></span>*Aph*. 1.[\*](#pp_1.md) Soul is; for there is no
proof that it is not.

   <span id="pp_1a"></span>*a*. Soul really is existent, generically;
since we are aware of this, that 'I think;' because there is no evidence
to defeat this. Therefore, all that is to be done is to *discriminate*
it \[from things in general\]. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_1b"></span>*b*. The discrimination of it he establishes
by means of two proofs:

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul is not Body, &c.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_2"></span>*Aph*. 2.[\*](#pp_2.md) This \[Soul,\] is
different from the Body, &c.; because of heterogeneousness, \[or
complete difference between the two\].

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The usage of language is evidence for this.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_3"></span>*Aph*. 3.[\*](#pp_3.md) Also because it \[Soul,\]
is expressed by means of the sixth \[or possessive,\] case.

   <span id="pp_3a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Soul is different from
Body, &c., also because the learned express it by the possessive case,
in <span id="page_421">p. 421</span> such examples as, 'This \[is\] my
body,' 'This \[is\] my understanding;' for the possessive case would be
unaccountable, if there were absolute non-difference \[between the Body,
or the like, and the Soul, to which it is thus attributed as a
possession\].

   <span id="pp_3b"></span>*b*. But then, suppose that this, also, is
like the expressions, 'The Soul's Thought' \[Soul and Thought being
identical\], 'Ráhu's head' \[the trunkless Ráhu being *all* head\], 'The
statue's body,' &c. To this he replies:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An objection disposed of.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_4"></span>*Aph*. 4.[\*](#pp_4.md) It is not as in the case
of the statue; because there is \[there\] a contradiction to the
evidence which acquaints us with the thing.

   <span id="pp_4a"></span>*a*. This expression by means of the
possessive case, <span id="page_422">p. 422</span> \[viz., 'My body' ([§
3](#pp_3).md)\] is not like 'The statue's body,' &c. In such a case as 'The
statue's body,' there is a mere fiction; 'for it is contradicted by the
evidence which acquaints is with the thing;' \[sense being the evidence
that there is here no body other than the statue\]. But, in such an
expression as 'My body,' there is no contradiction by evidence; for the
contradiction, by Scripture and other evidences, is only in supposing
the Body to be the Soul. Such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_4b"></span>*b*. Having settled that Soul is different
from Body, &c., he settles its emancipation:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul's aim how accomplished.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_5"></span>*Aph*. 5.[\*](#pp_5.md) Through the entire
cessation of pain there is done what was to be done.

   <span id="pp_5a"></span>*a*. But then, since there is an equality of
gain and loss, inasmuch as, through the cessation of Pain there is the
<span id="page_423">p. 423</span> ceasing of Pleasure, also, *that*
cannot be Soul's aim. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Pleasure no compensation for Pain.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_6"></span>*Aph*. 6.[\*](#pp_6.md) Not such desire for
pleasure is there to Soul, as there is annoyance from Pain.

   <span id="pp_6a"></span>*a*. And so the aversion to Pain, having
excluded also the desire for Pleasure, gives rise to a wish for he
cessation of Pain simply; so that there is not an equality of gain and
loss: \[but a clear gain, in the desired release\].

   <span id="pp_6b"></span>*b*. He declares that Soul's aim is simply
the cessation of Pain; because Pain is, indeed, abundant, in comparison
of Pleasure:

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

 

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Pleasure sparingly dispensed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_7"></span>*Aph*. 7.[\*](#pp_7.md) For \[only\] some one,
somewhere, is happy.

   <span id="pp_7a"></span>*a*. Among innumerable grasses, trees,
brutes, birds, men, &c., very few,—a man, a god, or the like,—are happy:
such is the meaning.

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Pleasure undeserving of the name.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_8"></span>*Aph*. 8.[\*](#pp_8.md) It \[Pleasure,\] is also
mixed with Pain, therefore the discriminating throw it to the side of
\[and reckon it as so much,\] Pain.

   <span id="pp_8a"></span>*a*. He rejects the opinion that Soul's aim
is not the simple cessation of Pain, but this \[cessation\] tinctured
with Pleasure:

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

 

|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Cessation of suffering is a joy.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_9"></span>*Aph*. 9.[\*](#pp_9.md) If you say that this
\[cessation of Pain\] is not Soul's aim, inasmuch as there is no
acquisition of Pleasure, then it is not as you say; for there are two
kinds \[of things desired\].

   <span id="pp_9a"></span>*a*. For we see, amongst men, quite a
distinct aspiration: \[the first,\] 'May I be happy;' \[the second,\]
'May I not be miserable;' \[and the latter is *our* conception of
beatitude\].

   <span id="pp_9b"></span>*b*. He ponders a doubt:

 

|                                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A doubt.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_10"></span>*Aph*. 10.[\*](#pp_10.md) The Soul \[some one
may suggest,\] has *no* quality; for there is Scripture for its being
unaccompanied, &c.

   <span id="pp_10a"></span>*a*. Therefore the cessation of Pain,
indeed, \[a property which does not belong to it,\] cannot be Soul's
aim: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_10b"></span>*b*. He clears up this \[doubt\]:

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This cleared up.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_11"></span>*Aph*. 11.[\*](#pp_11.md) Though it \[the
Pain,\] be the property of something else, yet it exists in it \[the
Soul,\] through non-discrimination.

   <span id="pp_11a"></span>*a*. Though qualities, viz., pleasure, pain,
&c., belong \[only\] to the *Mind*, they exist, i.e., they abide, in the
shape of a *reflexion*, in it, viz., in Soul, 'through
non-discrimination,' as the cause, owing to the conjunction of Nature
with Soul: such is the meaning. And this has been set forth in the First
Book.

   <span id="pp_11b"></span>*b*. The binding of Soul by the qualities
\[or fetters,\] arises from non-discrimination: but from what does
non-discrimination arise? With reference to this, he says:

 

|                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Two reasons why non-discrimination must have been from eternity.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_12"></span>*Aph*. 12.[\*](#pp_12.md) Non-discrimination
\[of Soul from Nature\] is beginningless; because, otherwise, two
objections would present themselves.

   <span id="pp_12a"></span>*a*. For, had it a beginning, then, if
\[first,\] it arose quite spontaneously, bondage might befall even the
liberated; <span id="page_427">p. 427</span> and, if \[secondly,\] it
were produced by Desert, &c., there would be a *regressus in infinitum*,
inasmuch as we should have to search for another \[previous instance
of\] non-discrimination, to stand as the cause of \[that\] Desert, &c.,
also: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_12b"></span>*b*. And then, if it be without beginning,
it must be everlasting. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Non-discrimination, though from eternity, may be cut short.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_13"></span>*Aph*. 13.[\*](#pp_13.md) It
\[non-discrimination, cannot be everlasting \[in the same manner\] as
the soul is; else, it could not be cut short, \[as we affirm that it can
be\].

   <span id="pp_13a"></span>*a*. It is not everlasting, indivisible, and
beginningless, in the same way as the soul is; but it is beginningless,
in the shape of an on-flow \[which may be stopped\]. For, otherwise, the
cutting short of a beginningless entity would, as is established by
Scripture, be unfeasible, \[though the beginningless antecedent
non-entity of a given jar may be readily understood to terminate, on the
production of the jar\]. Such is the meaning.

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

   <span id="pp_13b"></span>*b*. Having stated the cause of \[Soul's\]
Bondage, he states the cause of Liberation:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Bondage how destructible.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_14"></span>*Aph*. 14.[\*](#pp_14.md) It \[Bondage,\] is
annihilable by the alloted cause, \[viz., discrimination of Soul from
Nature\]; as darkness is \[annihilable by the allotted cause, viz.,
Light\].

 

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This enforced.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_15"></span>*Aph*. 15.[\*](#pp_15.md) Here, also, \[viz., in
the case of Bondage and Discrimination, as in the case of Darkness and
Light,\] there is allotment, \[as is proved\] both by positive and
negative consociation;<span
id="page_428_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_428_note_2.md) \[Liberation taking
place where Discrimination is, and not where it is not\].

   <span id="pp_15a"></span>*a*. He reminds \[us\] of what was mentioned
in the first Book,<span id="page_428_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_428_note_3.md)
viz., that Bondage cannot be innate, &c:

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Bondage not innate.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_16"></span>*Aph*. 16.[\*](#pp_16.md) Since it cannot be
\[accounted for\] in any other way, it is non-discrimination alone that
is \[the *cause* of\] Bondage, \[which cannot be innate\].

   <span id="pp_16a"></span>*a*. 'Bondage' here means the *cause* of
Bondage, named the conjunction of pain. The rest is plain.

   <span id="pp_16b"></span>*b*. But then, since liberation, also, from
its being a product, is liable to destruction, Bondage should take place
over again. To this he replies:

 

|                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Bondage does not recur.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_17"></span>*Aph*. 17.[\*](#pp_17.md) Further, Bondage does
not again attach to the liberated; because there is Scripture<span
id="page_429_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_429_note_4.md) for its non-recurrence.

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Evidence of this.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_18"></span>*Aph*. 18.[\*](#pp_18.md) Else, it
\[liberation,\] would not be the Soul's aim, \[which it is\].

   <span id="pp_18a"></span>*a*. He states the reason why this is not
Soul's aim:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Force of the evidence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_19"></span>*Aph*. 19.[\*](#pp_19.md) What happened to both
would be alike, \[if liberation were perishable\].

   <span id="pp_19a"></span>*a*. That is to say: there would be no
difference between the two, the liberated and the bound; because of
their being alike liable to future bondage; and, therefore, such
\[perishable emancipation\] is not Soul's aim, \[but emancipation final
and complete\].

   <span id="pp_19b"></span>*b*. But then, in that case, if you
acknowledge that there is a *distinction* between the bond and the free,
how is it <span id="page_431">p. 431</span> that you have asserted
\[[Book I., § 19](sak1.htm#pp_19.md),\] the *eternal* freedom \[of *all*
souls alike\]? To this he replies:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The nature of liberation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_20"></span>*Aph*. 20.[\*](#pp_20.md) Liberation is nothing
other than the removal<span
id="page_431_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_431_note_3.md) of the obstacle \[to the
Soul's recognition of itself as free\].

   <span id="pp_20a"></span>*a*. But then, in that case, since Bondage
and Liberation are *unreal*, Liberation must be contradictory to the
texts, &c., which set forth what is Soul's aim, \[as some positive and
real acquisition, not merely the removal of a screen\]; to which he
replies:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An objection repelled.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_21"></span>*Aph*. 21.[\*](#pp_21.md) Even in that case,
there is no contradiction.

   <span id="pp_21a"></span>*a*. That is to say: 'even in that case,'
i.e., even if Liberation consists \[only\] in the removal of an
obstacle, there is no contradiction in its being Soul's aim.

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

   <span id="pp_21b"></span>*b*. But then, if Liberation be merely the
removal of an obstacle, then it should be accomplished through mere
*hearing* \[of the error which stands in the way\]; just as a piece of
gold on one's neck, \[which one has sought for in vain, while it was\]
withheld from one by ignorance \[of the fact that it has been tied round
one's neck with a string\], is attained, \[on one's hearing where it
is\]. To this he replies:

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another objection repelled.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_22"></span>*Aph*. 22.[\*](#pp_22.md) This \[attainment of
Liberation, on the mere *hearing* of the truth,\] is no necessity; for
there are three sorts of those competent \[to apprehend the truth; but
not all are qualified to appropriate it, on merely hearing it\].<span
id="page_432_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_432_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_22a"></span>*a*. He mentions that not mere *hearing*
alone is seen to be the cause of knowledge, but that there are others,
also:

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Utility of other means besides hearing.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_23"></span>*Aph*. 23.[\*](#pp_23.md) Of others \[viz.,
other means besides hearing\] for the sake of confirmation, \[there is
need\].

   <span id="pp_23a"></span>*a*. He speaks of these same other means:

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Formality in postures not imperative.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_24"></span>*Aph*. 24.[\*](#pp_24.md) There is no
\[absolute\] necessity that what is steady and promoting ease should be
a \[*particular*\] posture, \[such as any of those referred to in [Book
III., § 34](sak3.htm#pp_34.md)\].

   <span id="pp_24a"></span>*a*. That is to say: there is no necessity
that a 'posture' should be the 'lotus-posture,' or the like; because
whatever is steady and promotes ease is a \[suitable\] 'posture.'

   <span id="pp_24b"></span>*b*. He states the principal means \[of
Concentration\]:

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The efficient means of Concentration.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_25"></span>*Aph*. 25.[\*](#pp_25.md) Mind without an object
is Meditation.

   <span id="pp_25a"></span>*a*. That is to say: what Internal Organ is
void of any modification, *that* is 'Meditation,' i.e., Concentration,
in the shape of exclusion of the modifications of Intellect: by reason
of the identity \[here,\] of effect and cause, the word 'cause' is
employed for 'effect.' For it will be <span id="page_434">p. 434</span>
declared how Meditation effects this \[exclusion of the modifications of
Intellect\].

   <span id="pp_25b"></span>*b*. But then, since Soul is alike, whether
there be Concentration or Non-concentration, what have we to do with
concentration? Having pondered this doubt, he clears it up:

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A distinction not without a difference.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_26"></span>*Aph*. 26.[\*](#pp_26.md) If you say that even
both ways there is no difference, it is not so: there is a difference,
through the excluion \[in the one case,\] of the tinge \[of reflected
pain which exists in the other case\].

   <span id="pp_26a"></span>*a*. But how can there exist a *tinge* in
that which is unassociated \[with anything whatever, as Soul is alleged
to be\]? To this he replies:

<span id="page_435">p. 435</span>

 

|                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul tinged by what does not belong to it.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_27"></span>*Aph*. 27.[\*](#pp_27.md) Though it \[Soul,\] be
unassociated, still there is a tingeing \[reflexionally,\] through
Non-discrimination.

   <span id="pp_27a"></span>*a*. That is to say: though there is not a
*real* tinge in that which is unassociated \[with tincture, or anything
else\], still there is, *as it were*, a tinge; hence the tinge is
treated as simply a *reflexion*, by those who discriminate the tinge
\[from the Soul, which it delusively seems to belong to\].

   <span id="pp_27b"></span>*b*. He explains this same:

 

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Its seeming presence explained.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_28"></span>*Aph*. 28.[\*](#pp_28.md) As is the case with
the Hibiscus and the crystal \[[Book I., § 19, *c*](sak1.htm#pp_19c.md).\],
there is not a tinge, but a fancy \[that there is such\].

   <span id="pp_28a"></span>*a*. He states the means of excluding the
aforesaid tinge:

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How to be got rid of.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_29"></span>*Aph*. 29.[\*](#pp_29.md) It \[viz.,the
aforesaid tinge,\] is debarred by Meditation, Restraint, Practice,
Apathy, &c.

<span id="page_436">p. 436</span>

   <span id="pp_29a"></span>*a*. He shows the means settled by the
ancient teachers, in regard to the exclusion—through Meditation, &c.,
lodged in the Mind,—of the tingeing of Soul:

 

|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The ancient dogma on this point.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_30"></span>*Aph*. 30.[\*](#pp_30.md) It is by the exclusion
of dissolution<span id="page_436_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_436_note_2.md) and
distraction, say the teachers.

   <span id="pp_30a"></span>*a*. That is to say: through the removal, by
means of meditation, &c., of the Mind's condition of \[being dissolved
in\] Sleep, and condition of \[waking\] Certainty, &c., there takes
place also the exclusion of the tingeing of Soul by the condition;
because, on the exclusion of any \[real\] object, there is the exclusion
also of its reflexion: so say the ancient teachers.

   <span id="pp_30b"></span>*b*. He states that there is no compulsion
that Meditation, &c., should take place in caves and such places:

<span id="page_437">p. 437</span>

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Meditation may take place anywhere.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_31"></span>*Aph*. 31.[\*](#pp_31.md) There is no rule about
localities; for it is from tranquillity of Mind.

   <span id="pp_31a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Meditation, or the
like, results simply 'from tranquillity of Mind.' Therefore, such a
place as a cave is not indispensable for it.

   <span id="pp_31b"></span>*b*. The discussion of Liberation is
completed. Now, with an eye to the unchangeableness of Soul, he handles
compendiously the cause of the world:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature the material of the world.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_32"></span>*Aph*. 32.[\*](#pp_32.md) Nature is the primal
material; for there is Scripture \[to the effect\] that the others are
products.

   <span id="pp_32a"></span>*a*. That is to say: since we learn, from
Scripture, that Mind, &c., are products, Nature is established under the
character of the radical cause of these.

   <span id="pp_32b"></span>*b*. But then, let *Soul* be the material.
To this he replies:

<span id="page_438">p. 438</span>

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul not the material of the world.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_33"></span>*Aph*. 33.[\*](#pp_33.md) Not to Soul does this
\[viz., the material of the world,\] belong, though it be eternal;
because of its want of suitableness.

   <span id="pp_33a"></span>*a*. That is to say: suitableness to act as
material implies possession of qualities, and the being associable:
\[and,\] by reason of the absence of both of these, Soul, though
eternal, \[and, therefore, no product,\] cannot serve as material.

   <span id="pp_33b"></span>*b*. But then, since, from such Scriptural
texts as, 'Many creatures have been produced from Soul,'<span
id="page_438_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_438_note_2.md) we may gather the fact
that Soul is a cause, the assertions of an illusory creation, &c., ought
to be accepted. Having pondered this adverse suggestion, he replies:

 

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The opposite view unscriptural.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_34"></span>*Aph*. 34.[\*](#pp_34.md) The despicable
sophist<span id="page_438_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_438_note_4.md) does not
gain \[a correct apprehension of\] Soul; because of the
contradictoriness \[of his notions\] to Scripture.

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

   <span id="pp_34a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the various views, in
regard to Soul's being a cause, which are conceivable are, all, opposed
to Scripture; therefore, the lowest of the bad reasoners, and others,
who are accepters thereof,<span
id="page_439_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_439_note_1.md) have no knowledge of the
nature of Soul. Hence it is to be understood that those, also, \[e.g.,
the *Naiyáyikas*,\] who assert that Soul is the substance of the
qualities Pleasure, Pain, &c., are quite illogical; these, also, have no
correct knowledge of Soul. And, if it be asserted that Soul is a cause
\[of the world\], just as the sky is the recipient cause of the clouds,
&c., \[and stands, towards it, in the relation of a cause, in so far as,
without the room afforded by it, these could not exist\], then we do not
object to *that*; for, what we deny is only that there is transformation
\[of soul, as material, into the world, as product\].

   <span id="pp_34b"></span>*b*. Since we see, that, in the case of
things motionless, locomotive, &c., the material cause is nothing else
than <span id="page_440">p. 440</span> *earth*, &c., how can *Nature* be
the material of all? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature the ultimate material cause.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_35"></span>*Aph*. 35.[\*](#pp_35.md) Though but mediately
\[the cause of products\], Nature is inferred \[as the ultimate cause of
the intermediate causes,\]; just as are Atoms, \[by the *Vaiśeshikas*\].

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature all-pervading.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_36"></span>*Aph*. 36.[\*](#pp_36.md) It \[Nature,\] is
all-pervading; because \[its\] products are seen everywhere.

   <span id="pp_36a"></span>*a*. But then, only if it be *limited*, can
it be said that, 'Wherever a product arises, there does it \[Nature,\]
go \[or act\];' \[for what is unlimited\] and fills all space, can find
no other space to *move* into\]. To this he replies:

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An objection parried.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_37"></span>*Aph*. 37.[\*](#pp_37.md) Though motion may
attach to it, this does not destroy its character as ultimate cause;
just as is the case with Atoms.

   <span id="pp_37a"></span>*a*. 'Motion' means action. Though it be
present, this does not prevent its \[Nature's,\] being the radical
cause; just as is the case with the earthy and other <span
id="page_441">p. 441</span> Atoms, according to the opinion of the
*Vaiśeshikas*: such is the meaning.

 

|                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature the proper substitute for eight of the substances in the Nyáya list.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_38"></span>*Aph*. 38.[\*](#pp_38.md) Nature is something in
addition to the notorious \[nine Substances of the *Naiyáyikas*\]: it is
no matter of necessity \[that there should be precisely nine\].

   <span id="pp_38a"></span>*a*. And the argument, here, is the
Scriptural declaration, that *eight* \[of the pretended primitive
substances\] are *products*: such is the import.

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature consists of the three Qualities.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_39"></span>*Aph*. 39.[\*](#pp_39.md) Purity and the others
are not *properties* of it \[viz., Nature\]; because they are its
*essence*.

   <span id="pp_39a"></span>*a*. That is to say: Purity and the other
Qualities are not *properties* of Nature; because they are what
*constitutes* Nature.

   <span id="pp_39b"></span>*b*. He determines the motive of Nature's
energizing; <span id="page_442">p. 442</span> since, if we held the
energizing to be without a motive, Emancipation would be inexplicable:

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature's disinterestedness.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_40"></span>*Aph*. 40.[\*](#pp_40.md) Nature, though it does
not enjoy \[the results of its own energizing\], creates for the sake of
Soul; like a cart's carrying saffron, \[for the use of its master. See
[Book III., § 58](sak3.htm#pp_58.md)\].

   <span id="pp_40a"></span>*a*. He states the concomitant<span
id="page_442_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_442_note_3.md) cause of diversified
creation:

 

|                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature treats every one according to his deserts.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_41"></span>*Aph*. 41.[\*](#pp_41.md) The diversity of
creation is in consequence of the diversity of Desert.

<span id="page_443">p. 443</span>

   <span id="pp_41a"></span>*a*. But then, granting that *creation* is
due to Nature, yet whence is *destruction*? For a couple of opposite
results cannot belong to one and the same cause. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Contrary results from Nature how.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_42"></span>*Aph*. 42.[\*](#pp_42.md) The two results are
through equipoise and the reverse of equipoise.

   <span id="pp_42a"></span>*a*. Nature is the triad of Qualities, viz.,
Purity, &c.; and their 'reverse of equipoise' is their aggregation in
excess or defect; the absence of this \[reverse of equipoise\] is
'equipoise:'<span id="page_443_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_443_note_2.md)
through these two causes two opposite results, in the shape of creation
and destruction, arise from one and the same: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_42b"></span>*b*. But then, since it is Nature's
attribute to create, there should be the mundane state, even after \[the
discriminative\] knowledge, \[which, it is alleged, puts an end to it\].
To this he replies:

<span id="page_444">p. 444</span>

 

|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature's energy does not debar emancipation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_43"></span>*Aph*. 43.[\*](#pp_43.md) Since \[or when,\] the
emancipated has understood \[that he never was really otherwise\],
Nature does not create; just as, in the world, \[a minister does not
toil,when the king's purpose has been accomplished\].<span
id="page_444_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_444_note_1.md)

   <span id="pp_43a"></span>*a*. But then, Nature does not rest from
creating; for we see the mundane condition of the ignorant: and so,
since Nature goes on creating, to the emancipated, also, Bondage may
come again. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   No reason why Nature should invade the emancipated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_44"></span>*Aph*. 44.[\*](#pp_44.md) Even though it
\[Nature,\] may invade others \[with its creative influences\], the
*emancipated* does not experience, in consequence of the absence of a
concurrent cause,<span id="page_444_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_444_note_4.md)
\[e.g., Non-discrimination, in the absence of which there is no reason
why the emancipated should be subjected to Nature's invasion\].

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span>

   <span id="pp_44a"></span>*a*. But then, *this* arrangement could be
possible then, \[only\] if there were a *multiplicity* of souls: but
*that* is quite excluded by the text of the non-duality of Soul. Having
pondered this doubt, he says:

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Multeity of Soul proved from the Veda.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_45"></span>*Aph*. 45.[\*](#pp_45.md) The multeity of Soul
\[is proved\] by the distribution \[announced by the *Veda* itself\].

   <span id="pp_45a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the multeity of Soul is
proved, absolutely, by the distribution of Bondage and Emancipation
mentioned in such Scriptural texts as, 'Whoso understand this, these are
immortal, while others experience only sorrow.'<span
id="page_445_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_445_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_45b"></span>*b*. But then, the distribution of Bondage
and Liberation may be through the difference of adjunct. To this he
replies:

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

 

|                                                                           |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Unity excluded by the supposion of Souls.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_46"></span>*Aph*. 46.[\*](#pp_46.md) If \[you acknowledge\]
an adjunct \[of Soul\], then, on *its* being established, there is
*duality*, \[upsetting the dogma founded on in [§ 44](#pp_44.md)\].

   <span id="pp_46a"></span>*a*. But then, the adjuncts, moreover,
consist of 'Ignorance,' \[which, according to the Vedánta, is no
reality\]; so that by these there is no detriment to \[the Vedántíc
dogma of\] non-duality. With reference to this doubt, he says:

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Vedánta cannot evade non-duality.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_47"></span>*Aph*. 47.[\*](#pp_47.md) Even by the two the
authority is contradicted.

   <span id="pp_47a"></span>*a*. Thst is to say: even by acknowledging
the two, viz., Soul and Ignorance, a contradiction is constituted to the
text, \[which is alleged as\] the authority for non-duality.

   <span id="pp_47b"></span>*b*. He states another couple of objections,
also:

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

 

|                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The establishment of the Vedánta tenet implies a contradiction.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_48"></span>*Aph*. 48.[\*](#pp_48.md) The primâ facie view
\[of the Vedánta\] is not \[to be allowed any force, as an objection\];
because, by \[admitting\] two, \[viz., Soul and Ignorance\], there is no
opposition \[to our own dualistic theory of Soul and Nature\]: and the
subsequent \[dogma, viz., that one single Soul is the only reality, is
not to be allowed\]; because of the non-existence of a proof, \[which,
if it *did* exist, would, along with Soul, constitute a duality\].

   <span id="pp_48a"></span>*a*. But then, Soul will be demonstrated by
its self-manifestation. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Self-manifestation contradictory.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_49"></span>*Aph*. 49.[\*](#pp_49.md) \[And,\] in its
\[Soul's,\] being demonstrated by the light \[of itself as you Vedántís
say it is\], there is the \[unreconciled\] opposition of patient and
agent \[in one, which is a contradiction\].

   <span id="pp_49a"></span>*a*. That is to say: if Soul be demonstrated
by the light which Soul consists of, there is the 'opposition of patient
and agent' \[in one\].

   <span id="pp_49b"></span>*b*. But then, there is no contradiction
\[here,\] between patient and agent; because it \[the Soul\], through
the property of light which is lodged in it, can, itself, furnish <span
id="page_448">p. 448</span> the relation to itself; just as the
*Vaiśeshikas* declare, that, through the intelligence lodged in it, it
is, itself, *object* to itself. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Illuminating function of Soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_50"></span>*Aph*. 50.[\*](#pp_50.md) This \[Soul\], in the
shape of Thought, discrepant from the non-intelligent, reveals the
non-intelligent.

   <span id="pp_50a"></span>*a*. But then, in that case, if duality be
established in accordance with proofs, &c., what becomes of the
Scriptural text declaring non-duality? To this he replies:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A salvo for the Vaidic view.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_51"></span>*Aph*. 51.[\*](#pp_51.md) There is no
contradiction to Scripture \[in our view\]; because that \[text of
Scripture which seems to <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> assert
absolute non-duality\] is \[intended\] to produce apathy in those who
have desires, \[and who would be better for believing in 'the
*nothingness* of the things of time'\].

   <span id="pp_51a"></span>*a*. He tells us that the assertors of
non-duality are to be shunned, not only for the reason above mentioned,
but, also, because of the non-existence of evidence to convince us that
the world is unreal:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The world's reality irrefragable.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_52"></span>*Aph*. 52.[\*](#pp_52.md) The world is real;
because it results from an unobjectionable cause, and because there is
\[in Scripture,\] no debarrer \[of this view of the matter\].

   <span id="pp_52a"></span>*a*. We see, in the world, that no reality
belongs to dream-objects, or to the \[fancied\] yellowness of
\[invariably white\] conch-shells, and the like; inasmuch as these are
results of the internal organ, &c., when \[not normal, but\] injured by
\[i.e., under the injurious influence of\] Sleep,<span
id="page_449_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_449_note_2.md) &c.: and this is not
\[the state of things\] in the \[waking\] Universe, in which Mind is the
first,<span id="page_449_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_449_note_3.md) \[according
to [Book I., § 71](sak1.htm#pp_71.md)\].

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

   <span id="pp_52b"></span>*b*. He declares that the Universe is real,
not merely in its existent state \[at any given instant\], but, also,
always:

 

|                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Creation excluded.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_53"></span>*Aph*. 53.[\*](#pp_53.md) Since it cannot be
\[accounted for\] in any other way, manifestation \[of whatever is
manifested\] is of what is real, \[i.e., of what previously existed\].

   <span id="pp_53a"></span>*a*. That is to say: since, through the
aforesaid reasons, it is impossible that the unreal should come into
existence, what does come into existence, or is manifested, is what
really existed \[previously,\] in a subtile form.

   <span id="pp_53b"></span>*b*. Though \[it is declared that\] the
being the agent and the being the experiencer belong to diverse
subjects, be asserts the distribution \[of agency to Self-consciousness,
and of experience to Soul,\] by two aphorisms:

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The real agent who.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_54"></span>*Aph*. 54.[\*](#pp_54.md) Self-consciousness,
not Soul, is the agent.

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Experience is got rid of when.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_55"></span>*Aph*. 55.[\*](#pp_55.md) Experience ceases at
\[discrimination of\] Soul, \[as being quite distinct from Nature\];
since it arises from its \[Soul's,\] Desert, \[which is not, *really*,
Soul's, but which, while Non-discrimination lasts, is made over to Soul;
just as the fruits of the acts of a king's ministers are made over to
the king\].

   <span id="pp_55a"></span>*a*. He shows the reason for what was stated
before, viz., that cessation of action does not result from enterings
into the world of Brahmá:

 

|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Paradise no security against transmigration.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_56"></span>*Aph*. 56.[\*](#pp_56.md) Even in the world of
the moon, &c., there is return \[to munane existence\]; because of there
really being a cause \[of such return\].

   <span id="pp_56a"></span>*a*. 'A cause,' viz., Non-discrimination,
Desert, &c.

   <span id="pp_56b"></span>*b*. But then, through the counsels of the
persons dwelling in these various \[supermundane\] worlds, there ought
to be no return \[to mundane existence\]. To this he replies:

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

 

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This point enforced.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_57"></span>*Aph*. 57.[\*](#pp_57.md) Not by the counsel of
\[supermundane\] people is there effectuation \[of Emancipation\]; just
as in the former case, \[the case, viz., of counsel given by mundane
instructors\].

   <span id="pp_57a"></span>*a*. But, in that case, what becomes of the
text that there no return from the world of Brahmá? To this he replies:

 

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A salvo for Scriptural text.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_58"></span>*Aph*. 58.[\*](#pp_58.md) There is Scripture
\[declaratory\] of Emancipation, \[on going to the world of Brahmá\];
this \[Emancipation\] being effected \[more readily in that world than
in this, but only\] by intermediacy \[of the appropriate means\].

   <span id="pp_58a"></span>*a*. He alleges the Scriptural text of
Soul's *going* \[to the locality where it is to experience\], even
though it be all-filling, \[and can, therefore, have no place into which
to move\]:

 

|                                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_59"></span>*Aph*. 59.[\*](#pp_59.md) And, in accordance
with the text of its 'going,' though it \[Soul,\] <span id="page_453">p.
453</span> is all-pervading, yet, in time, it reaches its place of
experience \[or body\], through conjunction with an adjunct; as in the
case of Space.

   <span id="pp_59a"></span>*a*. For, as Space, though it is
all-pervading, is spoken of as moving to some particular place, in
consequence of its conjunction with an adjunct, such as a jar, \[when we
say 'the space occupied by the jar is moved to the place to which the
jar is carried'\], just so is it \[here\].

   <span id="pp_59b"></span>*b*. He expounds the statement, that the
site of experience \[the body,\] is formed through the superintendence
of the experiencer, \[Soul\]:

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Body's existence dependent on Soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_60"></span>*Aph*. 60.[\*](#pp_60.md) This \[constitution of
a body\] is not accomplished in the case of what is \[organic matter\]
not superintended \[by Soul\]; because we find putrefaction \[in organic
matter where Soul is absent\].

   <span id="pp_60a"></span>*a*. But then, let the construction of a
site of experience \[or a body,\] for Experiencers \[i.e., Souls,\] take
place <span id="page_454">p. 454</span> without any superintendence at
all, through Desert. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Desert not the author of the Body.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_61"></span>*Aph*. 61.[\*](#pp_61.md) If you say that
\[independently of any superintendence,\] it is through Desert \[that a
Body is formed, it is not so\]; since what is unconnected \[with the
matter to be operated upon\] is incompetent thereto; as is the case with
\[unapplied\] water, &c., in respect of a plant.

   <span id="pp_61a"></span>*a*. That is to say: because it is
impossible that Desert, which is not directly conjoined with the semen
and other \[elements of the Body\] , should operate *through Soul*, in
the construction of the Body, &c.; just as it is for water, &c.,
*unconnected* with the seed, to operate *through tillage*, &c., in the
production of a plant.

   <span id="pp_61b"></span>*b*. According to the system of the
*Vaiśeshikas* and others, it is settled that Soul is the superintendent,
\[in the construction of the Body\], *in virtue of its being conjoined
with Desert*. But he tells us, that, in his own doctrine, <span
id="page_455">p. 455</span> since Desert, &c., are not properties of
Soul, the Soul cannot, *through these*, be the cause \[of the Body\]:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Reason for this.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_62"></span>*Aph*. 62.[\*](#pp_62.md) For this is impossible
\[viz., that the Soul should, *through its Desert*, &c., be the cause of
Body\]; because it has *no* qualities for these \[viz., Desert, &c.,\]
are properties of Self-consciousness, \[not of Soul\].

   <span id="pp_62a"></span>*a*. And so, in *our* opinion, it is settled
that Soul superintends \[in the causing of the Body,\] quite directly,
by conjunction simply, without reference to anything intermediate: such
is the import.

   <span id="pp_62b"></span>*b*. But, if Soul be all-pervading, then the
limitedness of the living soul, which is set forth in Scripture, is
unfounded. To repel this doubt, he says:

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

 

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul how limited and unlimited.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_63"></span>*Aph*. 63.[\*](#pp_63.md) The nature of a living
soul belongs to that which is qualified, \[not to soul devoid of
qualities, as is proved\] by direct and indirect argument.<span
id="page_456_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_456_note_1.md)

   <span id="pp_63a"></span>*a*. To be a living soul is the being
possessed of the vital airs; and this is the character of the soul
distinguished by peraonality, not of pure Soul, \[which is unlimited\].

   <span id="pp_63b"></span>*b*. Desiring, now, to set forth the
difference between the products of Mind \[or the Great Principle,\] and
of Self-consciousness, he first states the products of
Self-consciousness:

 

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The real agent what.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_64"></span>*Aph*. 64.[\*](#pp_64.md) The effectuation of
works is dependent on the agent Self-consciousness, not dependent on a
Lord, \[such as is feigned by the *Vaiśeshikas*\]; because there is no
proof \[of the reality of such\].<span
id="page_456_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_456_note_4.md)

   <span id="pp_64a"></span>*a*. By this aphorism are set forth, as are
also established <span id="page_457">p. 457</span> by Scripture and the
Legal Institutes, the creative and the destructive agencies of Brahmá
and Rudra<span id="page_457_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_457_note_1.md)
\[respectively\], owing to their adjunct, Self-consciousness, \[or
peronality\].

   <span id="pp_64b"></span>*b*. But then, grant that Self-consciousness
is the maker of the others, still who is the maker of
Self-consciousness? to this he replies:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The real agent whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_65"></span>*Aph*. 65.[\*](#pp_65.md) It is the same as in
the arising of Desert.

   <span id="pp_65a"></span>*a*. Just as, at the creations, &c., the
manifestation of Desert, which sets Nature energizing, results solely
from the particular *time*,—since, if we were to suppose other Desert as
the instigator of this, we should have an infinite regress,—just so
Self-consciousness arises from *time* alone. as the cause; but there is
not another maker thereof, also: thus, the two \[cases\] are alike: such
is the meaning.

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

 

|                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Orthodox recognition of Brahmá, Śiva, and Vishṇu, put forward.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_66"></span>*Aph*. 66.[\*](#pp_66.md) The rest is from Mind,
\[the Great Principle\].

   <span id="pp_66a"></span>*a*. What is other than the products of
Self-consciousness \[or personality\], viz., Creation, &c., that, viz.,
Preservation, &c., results from the Great Principle alone; because,
inasmuch as it consists of pure Goodness, having no Conceit, Passion,
&c., it is moved solely by benevolence towards others: such is the
meaning. And by this aphorism is established the character, as
Preserver, of Vishṇu, owing to the Great Principle, as adjunct<span
id="page_458_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_458_note_2.md) \[of the soul, which,
without adjunct, would neither create, preserve, nor destroy (see [§
64](#pp_64).md)\].

   <span id="pp_66b"></span>*b*. It has been stated, before, that the
relation of Nature and Soul, as experienced and experiencer, is caused
by Non-discrimination \[of the one from the other\]. Here, what is
Non-discrimination, itself, caused by? <span id="page_459">p. 459</span>
With reference to this doubt, he states that all philosophers reject, in
common, the doubt whether we should have an infinite regress, on the
supposition of a *stream* of Non-discrimination; because *this*
\[regress\] is *valid*; \[since an infinite regress which is in
conformity with the truth is no sound cause of objection\]:

 

|                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A theory which may be acquiesced in without detriment to the argument.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_67"></span>*Aph*. 67.[\*](#pp_67.md) The relation of
possession and possessor, also, if attributed \[as it is by some,\] to
Desert, in the case of Nature \[and Soul\], like \[the relation of\]
seed and plant, \[which takes the shape of an infinite regress of
alternants\], is beginningless.

 

|                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A second.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_68"></span>*Aph*. 68.[\*](#pp_68.md) Or \[the case is,
likewise, one of infinite regress,\] if it \[the relation between Nature
and Soul,\] be attributed to Non-discrimination \[of Soul from Nature\],
as Panchaśikha \[holds\].

<span id="page_460">p. 460</span>

 

|                                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A third.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_69"></span>*Aph*. 69.[\*](#pp_69.md) \[The case is the
same,\] if, as the teacher Sanandana does, we attribute it \[the
relation between Nature and Soul,\] to the Subtile Body, \[which, in the
shape of its elemental causes, attends Soul, even during the periodical
annihilations of the world\].

   <span id="pp_69a"></span>*a*. He sums up the import of the
declarations of the Institute:

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The summing up.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_70"></span>*Aph*. 70.[\*](#pp_70.md) Be that the one way,
or the other, the cutting short thereof \[viz., of the relation between
Nature and Soul,\] is Soul's aim; the cutting short thereof is Soul's
aim.
