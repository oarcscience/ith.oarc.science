# THE SÁNKHYA APHORISMS OF KAPILA.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## BOOK I.

   <span id="pp_0a"></span>*a*. Salutation to the illustrious sage,
Kapila!

   <span id="pp_0b"></span>*b*. Well, the great sage, Kapila, desirous
of raising the world \[from the Slough of Despond in which he found it
sunk\], perceiving that the knowledge of the *excellence* of any fruit,
through the desire \[which this excites\] for the fruit, is a cause of
people's betaking themselves to the means \[adapted to the attainment of
the fruit\], declares \[as follows\] the excellence of the fruit \[which
he would urge our striving to obtain\]:

 

|                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*The subject proposed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_1"></span>*Aph*. 1.[\*](#pp_1.md) Well, the complete
cessation of pain \[which is\] of three kinds is the complete end of
man.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

   <span id="pp_1a"></span>*a*. The word 'well' serves as a benediction;
\[the particle *atha* being regarded as an auspicious one\].

   <span id="pp_1b"></span>*b*. By saying that the complete cessation of
pain, which is of three kinds,—viz., (1) due to one's self
(*ádhyátmika*), (2) due to products of the elements (*ádhibhautika*),
and (3) due to supernatural causes (*ádhidaivika*),—is the *complete*
end of man, he means to say that it is the *chief* end of man, among the
four human aims, \[viz., merit, wealth, pleasure, and *liberation* (see
*Sáhitya-darpaṉa*, § 2)\]; because the three are transitory, whereas
liberation is *not* transitory: such is the state of the case.

|                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A question whether the end may not be attained by ordinary means.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_1c"></span>*c*. But then, let it be that the
above-mentionend cessation \[of all the three kinds of pain\] is the
complete end of man; still, what reason is there for betaking one's self
to a doctrinal system which is the cause of a knowledge of the truth, in
the shape of the knowledge of the difference between Nature and Soul,
when there are *easy* remedies for bodily pains, viz., drugs, &c., and
remedies for mental pains, viz., beautiful women and delicate food, &c.,
and remedies for pains due to products of the elements, viz., the
residing in impregnable localities, &c., as is enjoined in the
institutes of polity, and remedies for pains due to supernatural causes,
viz., gems \[such as possess marvellous prophylactic properties\], and
spells, and herbs of mighty <span id="page_3">p. 3</span> power, &c.;
and when \[on the other hand\], since it is hard to get one to grapple
with that very difficult knowledge of truth which can be perfected only
by the toil of many successive births, it must be still *more* hard to
get one to betake himself to the doctrinal system \[which treats of the
knowledge in question\]? Therefore \[i.e., seeing that this may be
asked\] he declares \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The end is not to be attained by ordinary means.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_2"></span>*Aph*. 2.[\*](#pp_2.md) The effectuation of this
\[complete cessation of pain\] is not \[to be expected\] by means of the
visible \[such as wealth, &c.\]; for we see \[on the loss of wealth,
&c.,\] the restoration \[of the misery and evil,\] after \[its
temporary\] cessation.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

   <span id="pp_2a"></span>*a*. 'The visible,' in the shape of the
drugs, &c., above-mentioned \[[§ 1. *c*.](#pp_1c.md)\].

   <span id="pp_2b"></span>*b*. 'The effectuation of this,' i.e., the
effectuation of the complete cessation of pain.

   <span id="pp_2c"></span>*c*. *Why* is it not \[to be thus effected\]?
Because, after the cessation (the cessation of pain is understood), we
see its restoration, the springing up again of pain in general, \[from
whichever of its three sources ([§ 1. *b*.](#pp_1b).md)\].

   <span id="pp_2d"></span>*d*. The state of the matter is this: not by
the expedients above-mentioned is there such a removal of pain, that no
pain arises thereafter; for, when, by this or that expedient, this or
that pain has been destroyed, we see other pains springing up.
Therefore, though it be *not* easy \[[§ 1. *c*.](#pp_1c.md)\], the
knowledge of truth \[as a complete remedy\] *is* to be desired.

   <span id="pp_2e"></span>*e*. But then, grant that *future* pain is
not debarred by drugs, &c., \[employed to remove present pain\], still,
by <span id="page_5">p. 5</span> again and again obviating it \[as often
as it presents itself\], there may be the cessation of *future* pain,
also. This doubt he states \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The question whether the end may not be attained by the recurrent use of ordinary means.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_3"></span>*Aph*. 3.[\*](#pp_3.md) \[Let us consider the
doubt\] that the soul's desire \[the cessation of pain, may result\]
from exertions for the obviation \[of pain\], as is the case with the
obviation of daily hunger

   <span id="pp_3a"></span>*a*. When pain shall arise \[let us suppose
one to argue\] then it is to be obviated; and thus there is the soul's
desire, the cessation of pain; just as one should eat, when there is
hunger; and thus there is the soul's desire of the eater, viz., the
cessation of hunger. In regard to this \[doubt\] he states the
recognized decision:

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This negation negatived.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_4"></span>*Aph*. 4.[\*](#pp_4.md) This \[method of
palliatives ([§ 3](#pp_3).md)\] is to be rejected by those who are versed
in evidence; because it is not everywhere possible \[to employ it at
all\], and because, even if this *were* possible, there would be an
impossibility as regards \[ensuring\] the perfect fitness \[of the
agents employed\].

   <span id="pp_4a"></span>*a*. For there are not physicians, &c., in
every place and at all times; and \[to rely on physicians, &c., would
not be advisable\], even if there were the possibility,—i.e., even if
these *were* \[always at hand\], since physicians are not *perfect* \[in
their art\];—for pain cannot with certainty be got rid of by means of
physicians, &c., with their drugs, &c. Moreover, when corporeal pain has
departed, there may still be that which is *mental*, &c.; so that there
is not \[under such circumstances\], in every respect, liberation from
pain. For these reasons, *such* a soul's aim \[as that which contents
itself with temporary palliatives\] is to be rejected by those who are
versed in evidence, \[i.e., who are acquainted with authoritative
treatises\].

   <span id="pp_4b"></span>*b*. He mentions another proof \[of his
assertion\]:

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Scriptural evidence in favour of this view.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_5"></span>*Aph*. 5.[\*](#pp_5.md) Also \[an inferior method
ought not to be adopted\] because of the preeminence of Liberation \[as
proved\] by the text \[of Scripture declaratory\] of its preeminence
above all else.

   <span id="pp_5a"></span>*a*. One ought not to endeavour after the
removal of this or that pain by these and those expedients \[[§ 1.
*c*.](#pp_1c)\]; since Liberation (*moksha*.md), by being eternal, is
transcendent as a remover of all pains. Moreover, one ought to endeavour
only after the knowledge of truth, which is the means thereof \[i.e., of
Liberation\]; because the Scripture tells its preeminence above all
\[other objects of endeavour\], in the text: 'There is nothing beyond
the gaining of Soul, \[with the utter exclusion of pain\].'

   <span id="pp_5b"></span>*b*. But then \[it may be suggested\], when
you say *liberation*, we understand you to mean from *bondage*. And is
that bondage essential? Or is it adventitious? In the former case, it is
incapable of destruction; if it come under the latter head, it will
perish of itself, \[like any other adventitious and, therefore,
transitory thing\]. What have we to do with your 'knowledge of truth,'
then? To this he replies \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An objection met.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_6"></span>*Aph*. 6.[\*](#pp_6.md) And there is no
difference between the two.

   <span id="pp_6a"></span>*a*. There is no difference in the
applicability of liberation, on either of the suppositions, that the
bondage is essential, and that it is adventitious, \[supposing it were
either (see [§ 19. *b*.](#pp_19b).md)\]. That is to say, we can tell both
how the bondage takes place, and how the liberation takes place.

   <span id="pp_6b"></span>*b*. Now, with the view of demonstrating
\[the real nature of\] Bondage and Liberation, he declares, exclusively,
in the first place, the objections to Bondage's being *essential* \[[§
5. *b*.](#pp_5b.md)\]:

 

|                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Liberation must be possible; else the means would not have been enjoined.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_7"></span>*Aph*. 7.[\*](#pp_7.md) There would be no rule in
the enjoining of means for the liberation of one bound *essentially*.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

   <span id="pp_7a"></span>*a*. Since Liberation has been stated \[[§
1](#pp_1.md)\] to result from the complete cessation of pain, \[it follows
that\] Bondage is the junction of pain; and this is not *essential* in
man. For, if that were the case, then there would be no rule, i.e., no
fitness, in the Scriptural or legal injunction of means for liberation:
such is what must be supplied, \[to complete the aphorism\]. Because, to
explain our meaning \[by an illustration\], *fire* cannot be liberated
from its *heat*, which is eseential to it; since that which is
*essential* exists as long as the substance exists.

   <span id="pp_7b"></span>*b*. And it has been declared in the Divine
Song \[the *Íśwara-gítá*,\]: 'If the soul were essentially foul, or
impure, or changeable, then its liberation could not take place even
through hundreds of successive births.'

   <span id="pp_7c"></span>*c*. \[Since some one may be disposed to
say\] '*Grant* that there is no fitness \[in the Scriptural and legal
injunctions, ([§ 7. *a*.](#pp_7a).md)\], what have we to do with *that*?'
Therefore he declares \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

 

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Scripture would be nugatory, if pain were inevitable.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_8"></span>*Aph*. 8.[\*](#pp_8.md) Since an essential nature
is imperishable, unauthoritativness, betokened by impracticableness,
\[would be chargeable against the Scripture, if pain were essential to
humanity\].

   <span id="pp_8a"></span>*a*. That is to say: since the essential
nature of anything is imperishable, i.e., endures as long as the thing
itself, it would follow \[on the supposition that pain is essential to
humanity\], that, since Liberation is *impossible*, the Scripture which
enjoins the means for its attainment is a false authority, inasmuch as
it is impracticable \[in its injunctions. And this is out of the
question; Scripture being assumed, here, as in all the others of the six
systems, to be an exact measure of truth\].

   <span id="pp_8b"></span>*b*. But then \[some one may say\], let it
*be* an injunction \[to use means for the attainment of an unattainable
object\], on the mere strength of Scripture; \[and, since Scripture is
an unquestionable authority, we may be excused from asking or answering
the question, *why* the injunction is given\]. To this he replies \[as
follows\]:

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An impracticable injunction is no rule.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_9"></span>*Aph*. 9.[\*](#pp_9.md) There is no rule, where
something impossible is enjoined: though it *be* enjoined, it is no
injunction.

   <span id="pp_9a"></span>*a*. There can be no fitness, or propriety,
in an injunction with a view to an impossible fruit; seeing that, though
something be enjoined, or ordered \[to be effected\] by means that are
impracticable, this is no injunction at all, but only the *semblance* of
an injunction; because it stands to reason, that not even the *Veda* can
make one see sense in an absurdity: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_9b"></span>*b*. Here he comes upon a doubt:

 

|                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A doubt whether the essential be not removable.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_10"></span>*Aph*. 10.[\*](#pp_10.md) If \[some one says\]
as in the case of white cloth, or of a seed, \[something essential may
be not irremovable, then he will find his answer in the next aphorism\].

   <span id="pp_10a"></span>*a*. But then \[the doubter is supposed to
argue\], the destruction even of what is essential \[in spite of what is
stated under [§ 7](#pp_7.md)\] *is* seen; as, for example, the essential
whiteness of white cloth is removed by dyeing, and the essential power
of germination in a seed is removed by <span id="page_12">p. 12</span>
fire. Therefore, according to the analogy of the white cloth and the
seed, it is possible that there should be the removal of the bondage of
the soul, even though it *were* essential. So, too, there may be
\[without any impropriety\] the enjoinment of the means thereof. Well,
*if* \[any one argues thus\], such is the meaning \[of the aphorism, to
which he proceeds to reply\].

   <span id="pp_10b"></span>*b*. He declares \[the real state of the
case, with reference to the doubt just raised\]:

 

|                                                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Decision that an essential property may be hidden, but not removed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_11"></span>*Aph*. 11.[\*](#pp_11.md) Since both
perceptibleness and \[subsequent\] non-perceptibleness may belong to
some power \[which is indestructible\], it is not something
*impracticable* that is enjoined, \[when one is directed to render some
indestructible<span id="page_12_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_12_note_*.md) power
imperceptible\].

   <span id="pp_11a"></span>*a*. In regard even to the two examples
above-mentioned \[[§ 10](#pp_10.md)\], people do not give an injunction for
\[the positive destruction of\]<span
id="page_12_fr_**"></span>[\*\*](#page_12_note_**.md) something essential,
which is indestructible \[[§ 8](#pp_8.md)\]. Why \[do we say this\]?
Because, in these two <span id="page_13">p. 13</span> instances of the
perceptibleness and non-perceptibleness of a power \[the powers, namely,
of appearing white and of germinating (see [§ 10. *a*.](#pp_10a).md)\],
there are merely the manifestation and \[afterwards\] the *hiding* of
the whiteness, &c., but not the *removal* of the whiteness, or of the
power of germination; because, that is to say, the whiteness of the dyed
cloth and the germinating power of the roasted seed can again be brought
out by the processes of the bleacher, &c., \[in the case of the dyed
cloth\], and by the will of the *Yogí*, \[the possessor of supernatural
powers, in the case of the roasted seed\], &c.

   <span id="pp_11b"></span>*b*. Having thus disproved the notion that
bondage is *essential* \[to man\], wishing to disprove also the notion
that it is the result of some \[adherent\] *cause*, be rejects the
\[various supposable\] causes, viz., Time, &c.:

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

 

|                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Time, which applies to all, cannot be the cause of the bondage of a part.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_12"></span>*Aph*. 12.[\*](#pp_12.md) Not from connexion
with *time* \[does bondage befall the soul\]; because this,
all-pervading and eternal, is \[eternally\] associated with *all*, \[and
not with those alone who are in bondage\].

   <span id="pp_12a"></span>*a*. The bondage of man is not caused by
*time*; because \[if that were the case,\] there could be no such
separation as that of the *liberated* and *unliberated*; because time,
which applies to everything, and is eternal, is at all times associated
with all men, \[and must, therefore, bring *all* into bondage, if any\].

 

|                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Place, for the same reason, cannot be the cause.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_13"></span>*Aph*. 13.[\*](#pp_13.md) Nor \[does bondage
arise\] from connexion with *place*, either, for the same \[reason\]

   <span id="pp_13a"></span>*a*. That is to say: bondage does not arise
from connexion with *place*. Why? 'For the same reason,' i.e., for that
stated in the preceding aphorism, viz., that, since it \[viz., place\]
is connected with *all* men, whether liberated <span id="page_15">p.
15</span> or not liberated, bondage would \[in *that* case\] befall the
*liberated*, also.

 

|                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The soul is not kept in bondage by its being conditioned.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_14"></span>*Aph*. 14.[\*](#pp_14.md) Nor \[does the bondage
of the soul arise\] from its being conditioned \[by its standing among
circumstances that clog it by limiting it\]; because *that* is the fact
in regard to \[not the soul, but\] the *body*.

   <span id="pp_14a"></span>*a*. By 'condition' we mean the being in the
shape of a sort of association. The bondage \[of the soul\] does not
arise from *that*; because *that* is the property of the *body* \[and
not of the soul\]; because, that is to say, bondage might befall even
the liberated \[which is impossible\], if that which is the fact in
regard to another could occasion the bondage of one quite different.

   <span id="pp_14b"></span>*b*. But then \[some one might say\], *let*
this conditioned state belong to the soul. On this point \[to prevent
mistakes\], he declares:

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

 

|                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The soul is absolute.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_15"></span>*Aph*. 15.[\*](#pp_15.md) Because this soul is
\[unassociated with any conditions or circumstances that could serve as
its bonds, it is\] absolute.

   <span id="pp_15a"></span>*a*. The word *iti* here shows that it
\[i.e., the assertion conveyed in the aphorism\] is a *reason*; the
construction with the preceding aphorism being this, that, *since* the
soul is unassociated, it belongs only to the body to be conditioned.

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The fruit of works belongs not to the soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_16"></span>*Aph*. 16.[\*](#pp_16.md) Nor \[does the bondage
of soul arise\] from any work; because \[works are\] the property of
another \[viz., the mind\], and because it \[the bondage\] would be
eternal,<span id="page_16_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_16_note_3.md) \[if the
case were as you imagine\].

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

   <span id="pp_16a"></span>*a*. That is to say: moreover, the bondage
of the soul does not arise from any work, whether enjoined or forbidden;
because works are the property of another, i.e., not the property of the
soul \[but of the mind\]. And, if, through a property of another, the
bondage of one quite distinct could take place, then bondage might
befall even the liberated, \[through some acts of some one else\].

   <span id="pp_16b"></span>*b*. But then \[some one may say\], this
objection does not apply, if we hold that bondage may arise from the
acts of the *associate*<span
id="page_17_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_17_note_2.md) \[viz., the mental
organ\]: so, with allusion to this, he states another reason, 'and
because it would be eternal,' i.e., because bondage, in the shape of
connexion with pain, would occur \[where it does not,\] even in such
cases as the universal dissolutions \[of the phenomenal universe,
including the mental organ, but *not* the soul\].

|                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A doubt whether the bondage, also, belongs not to something else than the soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_16c"></span>*c*. But then \[some one may say\], if that
be the case, then let the bondage, too, in the shape of connexion with
pain, belong \[not to the *soul*, but\] to the *mind* alone, in
accordance with the principle that it have the same locus as the works
\[to which it is due\]; and, since it is an established point that pain
is an affection <span id="page_18">p. 18</span> of the *mind*, why is
bondage \[i.e., connexion with pain\] assumed of the *soul*, also? With
reference to this doubt, he declares \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why it is to the soul that the bondage must belong.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_17"></span>*Aph*. 17.[\*](#pp_17.md) If it were the
property of any other, then there could not be diverse experience.

   <span id="pp_17a"></span>*a*. If bondage, in the shape of connexion
with pain, were the property of another, i.e., a property of the *mind*,
there could be no such thing as diverse experience; there could be no
such different experience as one man's experiencing pain, and another
man's not: \[for, it must be remembered, it is not in point of *mind*,
but of *soul*, that men are held, by Kapila, to be numerically
different\]. Therefore, it must be admitted that pain is connected with
the soul, also. And this \[pain that belongs to the soul\] is in the
shape merely of a *reflexion* of the pain \[that attaches to its
attendant organism\]; and this reflexion is of its *own* attendant
\[organism\] only; so that there is no undue result \[deducible from our
theory\].

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

   <span id="pp_17b"></span>*b*. He rejects also the notion that Nature
(*prakṛiti*) is *directly* the cause of bondage:

 

|                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature is not the immediate cause of the soul's bondage.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_18"></span>*Aph*. 18.[\*](#pp_18.md) If \[you say that the
soul's bondage arises\] from Nature, as its cause, \[then I say\] 'no;'
\[because\] that, also, is a dependent thing.

   <span id="pp_18a"></span>*a*. But then \[some one may say\], let
bondage result from *Nature*, as its cause. If you say so, I say 'no;'
because that, also, i.e., Nature, also, is dependent on the
*conjunction* which is to be mentioned in the next aphorism; because, if
it \[Nature\] were to occasion bondage, even *without* that
\[conjunction which is next to be mentioned\], then bondage would occur
even in such cases as the universal dissolution, \[when soul is
altogether disconnected from the phenomenal\].

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

   <span id="pp_18b"></span>*b*. If the reading \[in the aphorism\] be
*nibandhaná*<span id="page_20_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_20_note_1.md) \[in the
1st case, and not in the 5th\], then the construction will be as
follows: 'If \[you say that\] the bondage is caused by Nature,' &c.

   <span id="pp_18c"></span>*c*. Therefore, since Nature can be the
cause of bondage, only as depending on something else \[i.e., on the
conjunction to be mentioned in the next aphorism\], through this very
sort of conjunction \[it follows that\] the bondage is *reflexional*,
like the heat of water due to the conjunction of fire; \[water being
held to be essentially cold, and to *seem* hot only while the heat
continues in conjunction with it\].

   <span id="pp_18d"></span>*d*. He establishes his own tenet, while
engaged on this point, in the very middle \[of his criticisms on
erroneous notions in regard to the matter; for there are more to come\]:

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

 

|                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What really is the relation of its bondage to the soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_19"></span>*Aph*. 19.[\*](#pp_19.md) \[But\] not without
the conjunction thereof \[i.e., of Nature\] is there the connexion of
that \[i.e., of pain\] with that \[viz., the soul,\] which is ever
essentially a pure and free intelligence.

   <span id="pp_19a"></span>*a*. Therefore,<span
id="page_21_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_21_note_1.md) without the conjunction
thereof, i.e., without the conjunction of Nature, there is not, to the
soul, any connexion with that, i.e., any connexion with bondage; but,
moreover, just through that \[connexion with Nature\] does bondage take
place.

   <span id="pp_19b"></span>*b*. In order to suggest the fact that the
bondage \[of the soul\] is reflexional \[and not inherent in it, either
essentially or adventitiously\], he makes use of the indirect expression
with a double negative, \['not without'\]. For, if bondage were produced
by the conjunction \[of the soul\] with Nature, as colour is produced by
heating \[in the case of a jar of black clay, which becomes red in the
baking\], then, just like that, it would continue even after disjunction
therefrom; \[as the red colour remains in the jar, after the fire of the
brick-kiln has been extinguished, whereas the red colour occasioned in a
crystal vase by a China-rose, while it occurs *not without* the
China-rose, ceases, on the removal thereof\]. Hence, as bondage ceases,
on the disjunction \[of the soul\] from Nature, the bondage is merely
reflexional, and neither essential \[[§ 5. *b*.](#pp_5b.md)\] nor
adventitious \[[§ 11. *b*.](#pp_11b.md)\].

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

   <span id="pp_19c"></span>*c*. In order that there may not be such an
error as thot of the Vaiśeshikas, viz., \[the opinion that there is\] an
absolutely real conjunction \[of the soul\] with pain, he says 'which is
ever,' &c. \[[§ 19](#pp_19.md)\]. That is to say: as the connexion of
*colour* with essentially pure crystal does not take place without the
conjunction of the China-rose \[the hue of which, seen athwart the
crystal, seems to belong to the crystal\], just so the connexion of
*pain* with the soul, ever essentially pure, &c., could not take place
without the conjunction of some accidental associate; that is to say,
pain, &c., cannot arise spontaneously, \[any more than a red colour can
arise *spontaneously* in the crystal which is essentially pure\].

   <span id="pp_19d"></span>*d*. This has been declared, in the *Saura*,
as follows 'As the pure crystal is regarded, by people, as red, in
consequence of the proximity of something \[as a China-rose\] <span
id="page_23">p. 23</span> that lends its colour, in like manner the
supreme soul \[is regarded as being affected by pain\].'

   <span id="pp_19e"></span>*e*. In that \[aphorism, 19\], the perpetual
purity means the being ever devoid of merit and demerit; the perpetual
intelligence means the consisting of uninterrupted thought; and the
perpetual liberatedness means the being ever dissociated from *real*
pain: that is to say, the connexion with pain in the shape of a
*reflexion* is not a real bondage, \[any more than the reflexion of the
China-rose is a real stain in the crystal\].<span
id="page_23_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_23_note_*.md)

   <span id="pp_19f"></span>*f*. And so the maker of the aphorism means,
that the cause of its bondage is just a particular *conjunction* \[[§
19. *c*.](#pp_19c.md)\]. And now enough as to that point.

   <span id="pp_19g"></span>*g*. Now he rejects \[[§ 18.
*d*.](#pp_18d.md)\] certain causes of \[the soul's\] bondage, preferred by
others:

|                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Vedántic tenet on this point disputed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_20"></span>*Aph*. 20.[\*](#pp_20.md) Not from Ignorance,
too, \[does the soul's bondage arise\]; because that which is not a
reality is not adapted to binding.

   <span id="pp_20a"></span>*a*. The word 'too' is used with reference
to the previously mentioned 'Time,' &c., \[[§ 12](#pp_12.md), which had
been rejected, as causes of the bondage, antecedently to the statement,
in [§ 19](#pp_19.md), of the received cause\].

   <span id="pp_20b"></span>*b*. Neither, too, does \[the soul's\] union
with bondage result directly from 'Ignorance,' as is the opinion of
those who assert non-duality \[or the existence of no reality save one
(see *Vedánta-sára*, § 20. *b*.)\]; because, since their 'Ignorance' is
not a real thing, it is not fit to bind; because, that is to say, the
binding of any one with a rope merely *dreamt* of was never witnessed.

   <span id="pp_20c"></span>*c*. But, if 'Ignorance' *be* a reality \[as
some assert\], then he declares \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Vedántí cannot evade the objection, without stultifying himself.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_21"></span>*Aph*. 21.[\*](#pp_21.md) If it \['Ignorance'\]
*be* \[asserted, by you, to be\] a reality, then there is an abandonment
of the \[Vedántíc\] tenet, \[by you who profess to follow the Vedánta\].

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

   <span id="pp_21a"></span>*a*. That is to say: and, if you agree that
'Ignorance' *is* a reality, then you abandon your own implied dogma<span
id="page_25_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_25_note_*.md) \[see Nyáya Aphorisms I.,
§ 31\] of the unreality of Ignorance;' \[and so you stultify yourself\].

   <span id="pp_21b"></span>*b*. He states another objection:

 

|                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Vedántí cannot evade the objection, without conceding a duality.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_22"></span>*Aph*. 22.[\*](#pp_22.md) And \[if you assume
'Ignorance' to be a reality, then\] there would be a *duality*, through
\[there being\] something of a different kind \[from soul; which you
asserters of *non-duality* cannot contemplate allowing\].

   <span id="pp_22a"></span>*a*. That is to say: if 'Ignorance' is real
and without a beginning, then it is eternal, and coordinate with Soul:
if \[therefore\] it be *not* soul, then there is a duality, through
\[there being\] something of a different kind \[from soul; and this the
Vedántís cannot intend to establish\]; because these followers of the
*Vedánta*, asserting *non-duality*, hold that there is neither a duality
through there being something of the same kind \[with soul\], nor
through there being something of a different kind.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

 

|                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Vedántí must not allege tha 'Ignorance' is at once real and unreal.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_23"></span>*Aph*. 23.[\*](#pp_23.md) If \[the Vedántí
alleges, regarding 'Ignorance,' that\] it is in the shape of both these
opposites, \[then we shall say 'no,' for the reason to be assigned in
the next aphorism\].

   <span id="pp_23a"></span>*a*. The meaning is: if \[the Vedántí says
that\] 'Ignorance' is not *real*,—else there would be a duality through
\[there being\] something of a different kind \[from soul, which a
follower of the Vedánta cannot allow\],—and, moreover, it is not
*unreal*, because we experience its effects; but it is in the shape of
something at once real and unreal, \[like Plato's ὂν καὶ μὴ ὄν: (see
*Vedánta-sára*, § 21)\].

 

|                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   There is no such thing as a thing at once real and unreal.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_24"></span>*Aph*. 24.[\*](#pp_24.md) \[To the suggestion
that 'Ignorance' is at once real and unreal we say\] 'no;' because no
such thing is known \[as is at once real and unreal.\]

   <span id="pp_24a"></span>*a*. That is to say: it is not right to say
that 'Ignorance' is at once real and unreal. The reason of this he
states in the words 'because no such thing,' &c.; because any such thing
as is at once real and unreal is not known. <span id="page_27">p.
27</span> For, in the case of a dispute, it is neccssary that there
should be an *example* of the thing \[i.e. (see Nyáya Aphorisms, I., §
25), a case in which all parties are agreed that the property in dispute
is really present\]; and, as regards *your* opinion, such is not to be
found; \[for, where is there anything in regard to which both parties
are agreed that it is at once real and unreal, as they are agreed that
fire is to be met with on the culinary hearth?\]: such is the import.

   <span id="pp_24b"></span>*b*. Again he ponders a doubt:

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

 

|                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A question whether the Vedántí is bound to avoid self-contradiction.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_25"></span>*Aph*. 25.[\*](#pp_25.md) \[Possibly the Vedántí
may remonstrate\] '*We* are not asserters of any Six Categories, like
the *Vaiśeshikas* and others.'

   <span id="pp_25a"></span>*a*. 'We are not asserters of a definite set
of categories \[like the *Vaiśeshikas*, who arrange all things under six
heads, and the *Naiyáyikas*, who arrange them under sixteen\].
Therefore, we hold that there *is* such a thing, unknown though it be
\[to people in general\], as 'Ignorance' which is at once real and
unreal, or \[if you prefer it\], which differs at once from the real and
the unreal \[see <span id="page_28">p. 28</span> *Vedánta-sára*, § 21\];
because this is established by proofs,' \[Scriptural or otherwise, which
are satisfactory to *us*, although they may not comply with all the
technical requisitions of Gotama's scheme of argumentative exposition
(see Nyáya Aphorisms, I., § 35)\].

   <span id="pp_25b"></span>*b*. By the expression \[in the aphorism\]
'and others' are meant the *Naiyáyikas*; for the *Naiyáyika* is an
asserter of sixteen categories \[see Nyáya Aphorisms, I., § 1\].

   <span id="pp_25c"></span>*c*. He confutes \[this pretence of evading
the objection, by disallowing the categories of the Nyáya\]:

 

|                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The self-contradictory is altogether inadmissible.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_26"></span>*Aph*. 26.[\*](#pp_26.md) Even although this be
not compulsory \[that the categories be six, or sixteen\], there is no
acceptance of the inconsistent; else we come to the level of children,
and madmen, and the like.

   <span id="pp_26a"></span>*a*. Let there be \[accepted\] no system of
categories \[such as that of the *Vaiśeshika,* [§ 25](#pp_25.md)\]; still,
since *being* and *not-being* are contradictory, it is impossible for
disciples to <span id="page_29">p. 29</span> admit, merely on Your
Worship's assertion, a thing at once real and unreal, which is
inconsistent, contrary to all fitness: otherwise, we might as well
accept also the self-contradictory assertions of children and the like:
such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_26b"></span>*b*. Certain heretics \[deniers of the
authority of the Vedas\] assert that there exist external objects of
momentary duration \[individuaily; each being, however, replaced by its
facsimile the next instant, so that the uninterrupted series of
productions becomes something equivalent to continuous duration\], and
that by the influence<span id="page_29_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_29_note_2.md)
of these the bondage of the soul \[is occasioned\]. This he objects to,
\[as follows\]:

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

 

|                                                                                                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The heretical theory of a succession of momentary objects from all eternity, as causing the soul's bondage, rejected.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_27"></span>*Aph*. 27.[\*](#pp_27.md) \[The bondage\]
thereof moreover, is not caused by any influence of objects from all
eternity.

   <span id="pp_27a"></span>*a*. 'Thereof,' i.e., of the soul. An
eternal influence of objects, an influence of objects the effect of
which, in the shape of a continued stream, has had no commencement,—not
by *this*, either, is it possible that the bondage \[of the soul\] has
been occasioned: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_27b"></span>*b*. He states the reason of this
\[impossibility\]:

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A thing cannot act where it is not.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_28"></span>*Aph*. 28.[\*](#pp_28.md) Also \[in my opinion,
as well as in yours, apparently\], between the external and the internal
there is not the relation of influenced and influencer; because there is
a local separation; as there is between him that stays at Srughna and
him that stays at Páṭaliputra.

   <span id="pp_28a"></span>*a*. In the opinion of these \[persons whose
theory we are at present objecting to\], the soul is circumscibed,
residing entirely within the body; and that which is thus *within*
cannot stand in the relation of the influenced and the influencer, as
regards an *external* object. Why? Because they are separated in regard
to place; like two persons the one of whom remains in Srughna and the
other in Páṭaliputra: such is the meaning. Because the affection which
we call 'influence' (*vásaná*) is seen only when there is conjunction,
such as that of madder and the cloth \[to which it gives its colour\],
or that of flowers and the flower-basket \[to which they impart their
odour.\]

   <span id="pp_28b"></span>*b*. By the word 'also' the absence or
conjunction \[between the soul and objects (see [§ 10](#pp_10).md)\], &c.,
which he himself holds, is connected \[with the matter of the present
aphorism\].

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

   <span id="pp_28c"></span>*c*. Srughna and Páṭaliputra \[Palibothra,
or Patna\] are two several places far apart.

   <span id="pp_28d"></span>*d*. But then \[these heretics may reply\],
'The influence of objects \[on the soul\] may be asserted, because there
is a contact with the object; inasmuch as the soul, according to *us*,
goes to the place of the object, just as the senses, according to Your
Worship.' Therefore he declares \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   On the heretical view, the free soul would be equally liable to bondage.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_29"></span>*Aph*. 29.[\*](#pp_29.md) \[It is impossible
that the soul's bondage should arise\] from an influence received in the
same place \[where the object is; because, in that case\], there would
be no distinction between the two, \[the bond and the free\].

   <span id="pp_29a"></span>*a*. To complete the sense, we must supply
as follows: 'It is impossible that the bondage should arise from an
influence received in one and the same place with the object.' Why?
Because there would be no distinction between the two, the soul bound
and the soul free; because bondage would \[in that case\] befall the
liberated soul, also; \[the free soul, according to this hypothesis,
being just as likely to come across objects as any other\]: such is the
meaning.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

   <span id="pp_29b"></span>*b*. Here he ponders a doubt:

 

|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The heretic's attempted defence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_30"></span>*Aph*. 30.[\*](#pp_30.md) If \[the heretic,
wishing to save his theory suggests that a difference between the two
cases (see [§ 29](#pp_29).md) *does* exist\] in virtue of the *unseen*,
\[i.e., of merit and demerit, then he will find his answer in the next
aphorism\].

   <span id="pp_30a"></span>*a*. That is to say, \[the heretic may
argue\]: 'But then, granting that they \[the free soul and the bound\]
are alike in respect of their coming into contact with objects, when
they become conjoined with them in one and the same locality; yet the
*reception of the influence* may result merely from the force of the
*unseen*, \[i.e., from the merit and demerit of this or that soul; the
soul that is liberated alike from merit and demerit being able to
encounter, with impunity, the object that would enchain one differently
circumstanced\]': if \[*this* be urged, then we look forward\].

   <span id="pp_30b"></span>*b*. This he disputes, \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

 

|                                                                     |

   <span id="pp_31"></span>*Aph*. 31.[\*](#pp_31.md) They cannot stand in
the relation of deserver and bestower, since the two do not belong to
one and the same time.

   <span id="pp_31a"></span>*a*. Since, in thy opinion, the agent and
the patient are distinct, and do not belong to the same time
\[believing, as thou heretically dost, not only that *objects* (see [§
26. *b*.](#pp_26b).md) momentarily perish and are replaced, but that the
duration of *souls*, also, is of a like description\], there is
positively no such relation \[between the soul at one time and its
successor at another\] as that of deserver and bestower \[or transmitter
of its merits or demerits\]; because it is impossible that there should
be an influence of objects \[[§ 27](#pp_27.md)\] taking effect on a patient
\[say, the soul of to-day\], occasioned by the 'unseen' \[merit or
demerit\] belonging to an agent \[say, the soul of yesterday, which, on
the hypothesis in question, is a numerically different individual\]:
such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_31b"></span>*b*. He ponders a doubt:

 

|                                                                            |

son, \[then he will find his reply by looking forward\].

   <span id="pp_32a"></span>*a*. But then \[the heretic, admitting the
principle that <span id="page_35">p. 35</span> the merit or demerit of
an act belongs entirely to the agent, may urge that\], as the son is
benefited by ceremonies in regard to a son, such as that \[ceremony (see
Colebrooke's 'Hindu Law,' Vol. III., p. 104) celebrated\] in
anticipation of conception, which \[no doubt\] belongs to the *father*
\[who performs the ceremonies, to propitiatc the gods\], in like manner
there may be an influence of objects on the experiencer \[say, the soul
of to-day\], through the 'unseen' \[merit or demerit\] that belongs even
to a different subject \[say, the soul of yesterday\]: such is the
meaning \[of the heretic\].

   <span id="pp_32b"></span>*b*. He refutes this, by showing that the
illustration is not a fact:

 

|                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This will not help the heretic's argument.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_33"></span>*Aph*. 33.[\*](#pp_33.md) \[Your illustration
proves nothing;\] for, in that case, there is no one permanent soul
which could be consecrated by the ceremonies in anticipation of
conception, &c.

   <span id="pp_33a"></span>*a*. 'In that case,' i.e., on thy theory,
too, the benefit of <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> the son, by \[means
of the performance of\]<span
id="page_36_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_36_note_1.md) the ceremonies in
anticipation of conception, &c., could not take place; 'for,' i.e.,
because, on that theory, there is not one \[self-identical\] soul,
continuing from the \[time of\] conception to birth, which could be
consecrated \[by the ceremonies in question\], so as to be a fit subject
for the duties that pertain to the time subsequent to birth \[such as
the investiture with the sacred thread, for which the young Bráhman
would not be a fit subject, if the ceremonies in anticipation of his
conception had been omitted\]: and thus your illustration is not a real
one, \[on your *own* theory: it is not a thing that you can assert as a
fact\].

   <span id="pp_33b"></span>*b*. And, according to *my* theory, also,
your illustration is not a fact; seeing that it is possible that the
benefit to the son should arise from the 'unseen' \[merit\] deposited in
the son by means of the ceremony regarding the son: for it is an implied
tenet \[of my school\], that it \[the soul\] is permanent \[in its
self-identity\]; and there is the injunction \[of Manu, (Ch. II., v.
26), with regard to the ceremonies in question, which proceeds on the
same grounds\].

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

   <span id="pp_33c"></span>*c*. Some other heretic may encounter us, on
the strength of \[the argument here next stated, viz.,\] 'But then,
since *bondage*, also, \[like everything else\] is momentary, let this
bondage have nothing determinate for its cause, or *nothing at all* for
its cause,' \[which view of matters is propounded in the next
aphorism\]:

 

|                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Whether bondage may not be momentary, and so require no cause.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_34"></span>*Aph*. 34.[\*](#pp_34.md) Since there is no such
thing as a permanent result \[on the heretical view\], the momentariness
\[of bondage, also, is to be admitted\].

   <span id="pp_34a"></span>*a*. 'Of bondage': this must be supplied,
\[to complete the aphorism\].

   <span id="pp_34b"></span>*b*. And thus the point relied on is, that
it \[i.e., bondage\] have no cause at all. And so this is the
application \[of the argument, viz.\]:

|       |                                                                                      |

| \(2\) | Because it exists,                                                                   |

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

   <span id="pp_34c"></span>*c*. And \[continues the heretic,\] this
\[reason, viz., 'existence'\] does not extend *unduly*<span
id="page_38_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_38_note_1.md) \[as you may object,\] to
the case of a jar, or the like; because *that*, also \[in my opinion\],
is like the subject in dispute; \[in being momentary\]. This \[in fact\]
is precisely what is asserted in the expression, 'since there is *no
such thing* as a permanent result' \[[§ 34](#pp_34.md)\].

   <span id="pp_34d"></span>*d*. He objects \[to this heretical view\]:

| <span class="small">*   The fact of recognition proves that things are not momentary.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_35"></span>*Aph*. 35.[\*](#pp_35.md) No, \[things are *not*
momentary in their duration\]; for the absurdity of this is proved by
*recognition*.

   <span id="pp_35a"></span>*a*. That is to say: nothing is momentary;
because the absurdity of its being momentary follows from the opposite
argument \[to that under [§ 34. *b*.](#pp_34b.md)\]. taken from such facts
of recognition as, 'what I saw, that same do I touch,' \[an argument
which may be stated as follows\], viz.:

|       |                                                                 |

| \(3\) | \[Everything that exists is permanent,\] as a jar, or the like. |

 

|                                                                                                       |

| <span class="small">*   That things are momentary is contradicted by Scripture and reasoning.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_36"></span>*Aph*. 36.[\*](#pp_36.md) And \[things are not
momentary;\] because this is contradicted by Scripture and reasoning.

   <span id="pp_36a"></span>*a*. That is to say: nothing is momentary;
because the general principle, that the whole world, consisting of
effects and causes, is momentary, is contradicted by such texts as this,
viz., '\[All\] this, O ingenuous one, was antecedently existing,' and by
such Scriptural and other arguments as this, viz., 'How should what
exists proceed from the non-existent?'

 

|                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The heretic's illustration is not a truth.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_37"></span>*Aph*. 37.[\*](#pp_37.md) And \[we reject the
argument of this heretic;\] because his instance is not a fact.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

   <span id="pp_37a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the general principle
of the momentariness \[of all things\] is denied; because this momentary
churacter does not \[in fact\] belong to the apex of the lamp-flame,
&c., the instance \[on which thou, heretic, dost ground thy
generalization, ([§ 34. *b*.](#pp_34b).md)\]. Moreover, thou quite errest
in regard to momentariness, in that instance, from not taking account of
the minute and numerous instants \[really included in a duration which
seems to thee momentary\]: such is the import.

|                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   If things were momentary, there could be no relation of cause and effect.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_37b"></span>*b*. Moreover, if the momentary duration,
&c., \[of things\] be asserted, then there can be no such thing as the
relation of cause and effect, in the case of the earth and the jar, and
the like. And you must not say that there *is* no such thing as that
\[relation of cause and effect\]; because it is proved to be a reality
by the fact that, otherwise, there would be no such thing as the efforts
of him who desires an effect; \[and who, therefore, sets in operation
the causes adapted to its production\]. With reference to this, he
declares \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

 

|                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The causal relation is not between things that arise simultaneously.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_38"></span>*Aph*. 38.[\*](#pp_38.md) It is not between two
things coming simultaneously into existence, that the relation of cause
and effect exists.

   <span id="pp_38a"></span>*a*. Let us ask, does the relation of
product and \[material\] cause exist between the earth and the jar, as
*simultaneously* coming into \[their supposed momentary\] existence, or
as successive? Not the first; because there is nothing to lead to such
an inference, and because we should not \[in that case\] find the man,
who wants a jar, operating with earth, &c., \[with a view to the jar's
*subsequent* production\]. Nelther is it the last; in regard to which he
declares \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A product cannot survive its substantial cause.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_39"></span>*Aph*. 39.[\*](#pp_39.md) Because, when the
antecedent departs the consequent is unfit \[to arise, and survive it\].

   <span id="pp_39a"></span>*a*. The relation of cause and effect is,
further, inconsistent with the theory of the momentary duration of
things; because, at the time when the antecedent, i.e., the cause,
departs, the consequent, i.e., the product, is 'unfit,' i.e., is not
competent to arise; because, that is to say, a product is cognized only
by its inhering in \[and being substantially identical with, however
formally different from,\] its <span id="page_42">p. 42</span>
substantial cause, \[and is incapable, therefore, of surviving it\].

   <span id="pp_39b"></span>*b*. With reference to this same \[topic,
viz., the\] substantial cause, he mentions another \[the converse\]
objection \[to the theory of the momentary duration of things\]:

 

|                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The coexistence of substance and product is impossible, if things be momentary.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_40"></span>*Aph*. 40.[\*](#pp_40.md) Moreover, not \[on the
theory of the momentary duration of things can there be such a relation
as that of cause and effect\]; because, while the one \[the antecedent\]
exists, the other \[the consequent\] is incompatible, because the two
keep always asunder.<span id="page_42_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_42_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_40a"></span>*a*. To complete \[the aphorism\], we must
say, 'moreover, \[on the theory objected to\], there can be no such
relation as that of cause and effect; because, at the time when the
antecedent exists, the consequent cannot coexist with it, the two being
mutually exclusive.'<span id="page_42_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_42_note_4.md)
The two suggesters of the relation of cause and effect, in product and
<span id="page_43">p. 43</span> substance,<span
id="page_43_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_43_note_1) are (1.md) concomitancy of
affirmatives, that, while the product exists, the substance thereof
exists, and (2) this concomitancy of negatives,<span
id="page_43_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_43_note_2.md) that, when the substance
no longer exists, the product no longer exists: and these two
\[conditions, on *your* theory\] cannot be; because, since things \[in
your opinion,\] are momentary in their duration, the two \[viz., the
substance and the product\], inasmuch as they are antecedent and
consequent,<span id="page_43_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_43_note_3.md) belong to
opposite times, \[and cannot, therefore, coexist; for the product,
according to you, does not come into existence until its substance has
perished, which is contrary to the nature of the causal relation just
defined\].

   <span id="pp_40b"></span>*b*. But then, \[the heretic may say, do not
let the *coexistence* of substance and product be insisted upon, as
indispensable to the causal relation between the two, but\] 'let the
nature of a cause belong to the substantial cause, <span id="page_44">p.
44</span> as it belongs to the *instrumental* cause, in respect merely
of its *antecedence*.' To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Antecedence to the product does not distinguish the Matter from the Instrument.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_41"></span>*Aph*. 41.[\*](#pp_41.md) If there were merely
*antecedence*, then there would be no determination \[of a substantial
or material cause, as distinguished from an instrumental cause\].

   <span id="pp_41a"></span>*a*. And it could not be determined that
this was the *substance* \[of this or that product\], on the granting of
nothing more than its *antecedence* \[to the product\]; because
antecedence constitutes no distinction between it and the *instrumental*
causes; for, \[as we need scarcely remind you\], that there *is* a
distinction between instrumental and substantial causes, the whole world
is agreed: such is the meaning.

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The question whether anything exists besides Thought.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_41b"></span>*b*. Other heretics say: 'Since nothing
\[really\] exists, except *Thought*, neither does *Bondage*; just as the
things of a dream \[have no real existence\]. <span id="page_45">p.
45</span> Therefore it has *no* cause; nor it is absolutely *false*.' He
rejects the opinion of these \[heretics\]:

 

|                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   We have the evidence of Intuition for the External, as well as for the Internal.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_42"></span>*Aph*. 42.[\*](#pp_42.md) Not Thought alone
exists; because there is the intuition of the external.

   <span id="pp_42a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the *reality* is not
*Thought* alone; because external objects, also, are proved to exist,
just as Thought is, by intuition.

   <span id="pp_42b"></span>*b*. But then \[these heretics may rejoin\],
'From the example of intuitive perception in *dreams* \[see Butler's
'Analogy,' Part I., Ch. I.\], we find this \[your supposed evidence of
objective reality\] to exist, even in the *absence* of objects!' To this
he replies:

 

|                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The denial of the external amounts to Nihilism.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_43"></span>*Aph*. 43.[\*](#pp_43.md) Then, since, if the
one does not exist, the other does not exist, there is a void, \[i.e.,
nothing exists at all\].

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

   <span id="pp_43a"></span>*a*. That is to say: if external things do
not exist, then a mere void offers itself. Why? Because, if the external
does not exist, then *thought* does not exist; for it is *intuition*
that proves the objective: and, if the intuition of the external did not
establish the objective, then the intuition of *thought*, also, would
not establish \[the existence of\] thought.

   <span id="pp_43b"></span>*b*. 'Then *let* the reality be a mere void;
and, therefore, the searching for the cause of Bondage is unfitting,
*just because a void is all*:' with such a proposal \[as recorded in the
next aphorism\] does \[some one who may claim the title of\] the very
crest-gem of the heretics rise up in opposition:

 

|                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The heretic goes the length of asserting sheer Nihilism.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_44"></span>*Aph*. 44.[\*](#pp_44.md) The reality is a void:
what is perishes; because to perish is the habit of things.

   <span id="pp_44a"></span>*a*. The void alone \[says this prince of
heretics, or the fact that nothing exists at all\] is the reality, \[or
the only <span id="page_47">p. 47</span> truth\]. Since everything that
exists perishes, and that which is perishable is false, as is a dream,
therefore, as of all things the beginnings and endings are merely
nonentities, Bondage, &c., in the midst \[of any beginning and ending\],
has merely a momentary existence,—is phenomenal, and not real.
Therefore, *who* can be bound by *what*? This \[question\] is what we
rest upon. The reason assigned for the perishableness of whatever exists
is, 'because to perish is the habit of things;' because to perish is the
*very nature* of things: but nothing continues, after quitting its own
*nature*; \[so that nothing could continue, if it *ceased* to perish\]:
such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_44b"></span>*b*. He rejects \[this heretical view\]

 

|                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nihilism denied; as the indiscerptible is indestructible.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_45"></span>*Aph*. 45.[\*](#pp_45.md) This is a mere
counter-assertion of unintelligent persons.

   <span id="pp_45a"></span>*a*. 'Of unintelligent persons,' i.e., of
blockheads, this is 'a mere counter-assertion,' i.e., a mere *idle*
counter-assertion that a thing must needs be perishable, *because it*
<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> *exists*; \[and such an assertion is
idle,\] because things that are not made up of parts, since there is no
cause of the destruction of such things, cannot perish.

   <span id="pp_45b"></span>*b*. \[But\] what need of many words? It is
not the fact, that even *products* perish; \[for\] just as, by the
cognition that 'the jar is old' \[we mean that it has passed from the
condition of new to that of old\], so, too, by such a cognition as this,
that 'the jar has passed away,' it is settled only that the jar, or the
like, *is in the condition* of having passed away.

   <span id="pp_45c"></span>*c*. He states another objection \[to the
heretical view\]:

 

|                                                                                                                       |

| <span class="small">*   Nihilism is open to the same objections as both the Momentary and the Ideal theories.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_46"></span>*Aph*. 46.[\*](#pp_46.md) Moreover, this
\[nihilistic theory is not a right one\]; because it has the same
fortune as both the views \[which were confuted just before\].

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

   <span id="pp_46a"></span>*a*. This view, moreover \[[§ 44](#pp_44.md)\],
is not a good one; because it has the same fortune as, i.e., is open to
similar reasons for rejection as, the theory that external things are
momentary \[[§ 26. *b*.](#pp_26b.md)\], and as the theory that nothing
exists besides Thought \[[§ 41. *b*.](#pp_41b.md)\]. The reason for the
rejection of the theory that things are momentary in their duration.
viz. \[as stated in [§ 35](#pp_35.md)\], the fact of *recognition*, &c.,
\[which is, at least, as little consistent with Nihilism as it is with
the momentary duration of things\], and the reason for the rejection of
the theory that nothing exists besides Thought. viz. \[as stated in [§
42](#pp_42.md)\], the intuition of the external, &c., apply equally here
\[in the case of Nihilism\]: such is the import.

   <span id="pp_46b"></span>*b*. Moreover, as for the opinion which is
accepted by these \[heretics\], viz., '*Let the mere void* \[of absolute
nonentity\] be the soul's aim \[and *summum bonum*\], since herein
consist at once the cessation of pain \[which cannot continue, when
there is absolutely *nothing*\], and also the means thereof \[since
there can be no further means required for the removal of anything, if
it be settled that the thing positively does not exist\],' this too, can
hardly be: so he declares \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

 

|                                                                    |

   <span id="pp_47"></span>*Aph*. 47.[\*](#pp_47.md) In neither way
\[whether as a means, or as an end,\] is this \[annihilation\] the
soul's aim.

   <span id="pp_47a"></span>*a*. 'Let the void \[of mere nonentity\] be
the soul's aim, whether as consisting in the cessation of pain, or as
presenting the means for the cessation of pain,' \[says the heretic. And
this cannot be; because the \[whole\] world agrees, that the aim of the
soul consists in the joys, &c., that shall abide *in it*; that is to
say, because \[*they* hold, while\] *you* do not hold, that there is a
*permanent* soul, \[(see [§ 33](#pp_33).md) in respect of which the
liberation or beatification would be possible, or even predicable\].

   <span id="pp_47b"></span>*b*. Now \[certain\] other things, also,
entertained, as causes of \[the soul's\] bondage, by \[imperfectly
instructed\] believers, remaining over and above those \[proposed by
unbelievers, and\] already rejected, are to be set aside:

 

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   It is by no movement that the soul gets into bondage.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_48"></span>*Aph*. 48.[\*](#pp_48.md) Not from any kind of
motion \[such as its entrance into a body, does the soul's bondage
result\].

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

   <span id="pp_48a"></span>*a*. 'Bondage' \[required to complete the
aphorism\] is understood from the topic \[of discussion\].

   <span id="pp_48b"></span>*b*. The meaning is, that the soul's
bondage, moreover, does not result from any sort of *motion*, in the
shape, for instance, of its entrance into a body.

   <span id="pp_48c"></span>*c*. He states a reason for this:

 

|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What is all-pervading does not change place.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_49"></span>*Aph*. 49.[\*](#pp_49.md) Because this is
impossible for what is inactive, \[or in other words without motion\]

   <span id="pp_49a"></span>*a*. That is to say: because this is
impossible, i.e., *motion* is impossible, in the case of the soul, which
is inactive, \[because\] all-pervading, \[and, therefore, incapable of
changing its place\].

   <span id="pp_49b"></span>*b*. But then \[the objector may say\],
'Since, in the books of Scripture and of law, we hear of its *going* and
*coming* into this world and the other world, let soul be \[not
all-pervading, as you allege, but\] merely limited \[in its extent\]:
and to this effect, also, is the text, 'Of the size <span
id="page_52">p. 52</span> of the thumb is the soul, the inner spirit,'
and the like:<span id="page_52_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_52_note_1.md) \[but\]
this conjecture he repels:

 

|                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Were the soul limited, it might be perishable.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_50"></span>*Aph*. 50.[\*](#pp_50.md) \[We cannot admit that
the soul is other than all-pervading; because\] by its being limited,
since it would come under the same conditions as jars, &c., there would
be a contradiction to our tenet \[of its imperishableness\].

   <span id="pp_50a"></span>*a*. That is to say: and, if the soul were
admitted to be, like a jar, or the like, limited, i.e. circumscribed
\[in dimension\], then, since it would resemble a jar, or the like, in
being made up of parts, and \[hence\] in being perishable, &c., this
would be contrary to our settled principle, \[that the soul is
imperishable\].<span id="page_52_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_52_note_*.md)

   <span id="pp_50b"></span>*b*. He now justifies the text \[see [§ 49.
*b*.](#pp_49b.md)\] referring to the *motion* \[of the soul, by showing
that the motion is not really of the soul, but of an accessory\]:

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

 

|                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul moves not, any more than Space.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_51"></span>*Aph*. 51.[\*](#pp_51.md) The text regarding the
*motion* \[of the soul\], moreover, is \[applicable, only\] because of
the junction of an *attendant*;<span
id="page_53_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_53_note_1.md) as in the case of the
Ether \[or *Space*, which moves not, though we talk of the space
enclosed in a jar, as moving with the jar\].

   <span id="pp_51a"></span>*a*. Since there are such proofs of the
soul's unlimitedness, as the declaration that 'It is eternal,
omnipresent, permanent,'<span
id="page_53_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_53_note_2.md) the text<span
id="page_53_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_53_note_3.md) regarding its motion is to
be explained as having reference to a movement pertaining \[not to the
soul, but\] to an attendant; for there is the text, 'As the Ether \[or
space\] included in a jar, when the jar is removed, \[in this case\] the
*jar* may be removed, but not the space; and in like manner is the soul,
which is like the sky, \[incapable of being moved\]';<span
id="page_53_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_53_note_4.md) and because we may
conclude that the motion \[erroneously supposed to belong to the soul
([49. *b*.](#pp_49b).md),\] belongs to *Nature* \[see *Vedánta Aphorisms*,
Part I., § 4. *l*.\], from such maxims<span
id="page_53_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_53_note_3.md) as this, that 'Nature does
the works the fruits of which are blissful or baneful; <span
id="page_54">p. 54</span> and it is wilful *Nature* that\] in the three
worlds, reaps these': such is the import.<span
id="page_54_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_54_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_51b"></span>*b*. It has already been denied \[[§
16](#pp_16.md)\] that the bondage \[of the soul\] is occasioned by works\]
in the shape either of enjoined or of forbidden actions. Now he declares
that the bondage, moreover\] does not arise from the 'unseen' \[merit or
demerit\] resulting therefrom:

 

|                                                                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The bondage of the soul is no result of any merit or demerit.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_52"></span>*Aph*. 52.[\*](#pp_52.md) Nor, moreover, \[does
the bondage of the soul result from the merit or demerit arising\] from
works; because these belong not thereto.

   <span id="pp_52a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the bondage of the soul
does not arise directly from the 'unseen' \[merit or demerit\]
occasioned <span id="page_55">p. 55</span> by works.<span
id="page_55_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_55_note_1.md) Why? Because this is no
property thereof, i.e., because this \[merit or demerit (see [§ 16.
*a*.](#pp_16a).md)\] is no property of the soul.

   <span id="pp_52b"></span>*b*. But then \[some one may say\], '*Let*
it be that the bondage resulting from the 'unseen,' i.e., the merit \[or
demerit\] even of another, should attach to a different person;'
whereupon he declares \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Else, bondage might cling even to the emancipated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_53"></span>*Aph*. 53.[\*](#pp_53.md)<span
id="page_55_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_55_note_4.md) If the case were otherwise
\[than as I say\], then it \[the bondage of the soul might extend
unduly, even to the emancipated\].

   <span id="pp_53a"></span>*a*. That is to say: if the case were
otherwise, if bondage and its cause were under other conditions \[than
we have declared them to be\], then there might be an undue extension;
bondage would befall even the emancipated, \[for the same reasons as
those stated under [§ 16. *a*.](#pp_16a.md)\].

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

   <span id="pp_53b"></span>*b*. What need of so much \[prolixity\]? He
states a general objection why the bondage of soul cannot result from
any one or other \[of these causes\], beginning with its essence \[see
[§ 6. *b*.](#pp_6b.md)\], and ending with its \[supposed\] works \[see [§
16](#pp_16.md)\]; inasmuch as it is contrary to Scripture, \[that any one
of these should be the cause\]:

 

|                                                                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A single text of Scripture upsets, equally, all the heretical notions of the soul's relation to bondage.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_54"></span>*Aph*. 54.[\*](#pp_54.md) And this \[opinion,
that the bondage of the soul arises from any of causes alleged by the
heretics,\] is contrary to such texts as the one that declares it \[the
soul\] to be without qualities: and so much for that point.

   <span id="pp_54a"></span>*a*. And, if the bondage of the soul arose
from any one or other of those \[supposed causes already treated of,\]
among which its essential character \[[§ 6. *b*.](#pp_6b.md)\] is the
first, this would be contradictory to such texts as, 'Witness,
intelligent, alone, and without the \[three\] qualities \[is the
soul\]:'<span id="page_56_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_56_note_2.md) such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_54b"></span>*b*. The expression 'and so much for that
point' means, <span id="page_57">p. 57</span> that the investigation of
the cause of the bondage \[of the soul\] here closes.

   <span id="pp_54c"></span>*c*. The case, then, stands thus: since
\[all\] other \[theories\] are overthrown by the declaratory aphorisms,
'There would be no fitness in the enjoining' \[see [§ 7](#pp_7.md)\], &c.,
it is ascertained that the immediate cause of the bondage \[of the
soul\] is just the conjunction of Nature and of the soul.

   <span id="pp_54d"></span>*d*. But then, in that case, \[some one may
say\], this conjunction of Nature and of the soul \[[§ 54.
*c*.](#pp_54c.md)\], whether it be essential, or adventitiously caused by
Time or something else \[[§ 5. *b*.](#pp_5b.md)\], must occasion the
bondage even of the *emancipated*. Having pondered this doubt, he
disposes of it \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How the true cause of bondage affects not the emancipated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_55"></span>*Aph*. 55.[\*](#pp_55.md) Moreover, the
conjunction thereof does not, through non-discrimination, take place
\[in the case of the emancipated\]; nor is there a parity, <span
id="page_58">p. 58</span> \[in this respect, between the emancipated and
the unemancipated\].

   <span id="pp_55a"></span>*a*. 'The conjunction thereof,' i.e., the
conjunction of Nature and of the soul; this conjunction, moreover, does
not take place again 'through non-discrimination,' i.e., through the
want of a discrimination \[between Nature and soul\] in the emancipated,
\[who *do* discriminate, and who thus avoid the conjunction which
others, failing to discriminate, incur, and thus fall into bondage\]:
such is the meaning. And thus the emancipated and the bound are *not* on
a level, \[under the circumstances stated at [§ 54. *c*.](#pp_54c.md)\]:
such is the import.

 

|                                                                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The true cause of bondage, in other words, non-discrimination.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_56"></span>*Aph*. 56.[\*](#pp_56.md) Bondage arises from
the error \[of not discriminating between Nature and soul\].<span
id="page_58_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_58_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_56a"></span>*a*. Having thus declared the cause of that
\[bondage\] <span id="page_59">p. 59</span> which is to be got rid of,
he declares the means of getting rid of it:\]

 

|                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Non-discrimination is removable by discrimination alone.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_56"></span>*Aph*. 56.[\*](#pp_56.md) The removal of it is
to be effected by the necessary means, just like darkness.

   <span id="pp_56a"></span>*a*. The necessary means, established
throughout the world, in such cases as 'shell-silver' \[i.e., a
pearl-oyster-shell mistaken for silver\], viz., the *immediacy* of
discrimination, by *this* alone is 'its removal,' i.e., the removal of
the non-discrimination \[between Nature and soul\], to be effected, and
not by *works*, or the like: such is the meaning: just as darkness, the
dark, is removed by light alone, \[and by no other means\].

   <span id="pp_56b"></span>*b*. 'But then \[some one may say\], if
merely the non-discrimination of Nature and soul be, through the
conjunction \[of the two, consequent on the want of discrimination\],
the cause of bondage, and if merely the discrimination of the two be the
cause of liberation, then there would be liberation, even while there
remained the conceit of \[one's possessing\] a body, &c.; and this is
contrary to Scripture, <span id="page_60">p. 60</span> to the institutes
of law, and to sound reasoning.' To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The discrimination of Nature, as other than soul, involves all discrimination.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_57"></span>*Aph*. 57.[\*](#pp_57.md) Since the
non-discrimination of other things \[from soul\] results from the
non-discrimination of *Nature* \[from soul\], the cessation of this will
take place, on the cessation of that \[from which it results\].

   <span id="pp_57a"></span>*a*. By reason of the non-discrimination of
*Nature* from the soul, what non-discrimination of *other* things there
*is*, such as the non-discrimination of the *understanding* \[as
something other than the soul\], *this* necessarily ceases, on the
cessation of the non-discrimination of Nature; because, when the
non-discrimination of the understanding, for example, \[as something
other than soul,\] does occur, it is *based* on the non-discrimination
\[from soul\] of that cause to which there is none antecedent \[viz.,
Nature\]; since the non-discrimination of an *effect* \[and the
'understanding' is an effect or product of Nature,\] is, itself, an
effect, \[and will, of course, cease, with the cessation of its cause\].

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

   <span id="pp_57b"></span>*b*. The state of the case is this: as, when
the soul has been discriminated from the *body*, it is impossible but
that it should be discriminated from the *colour* and other
\[properties\], the effects of the body, \[which is the substantial
cause of its own properties\]; so, by parity of reasoning, from the
departure of the cause, when soul, in its character of
*unalterableness*, &c., has been discriminated from *Nature*, it is
impossible that there should remain a conceit of \[the soul's being any
of\] the *products* thereof \[i.e., of Nature\], such as the
'understanding,' and the like, which have the character of being
*modifications* \[of primal Nature, while the soul, on the other hand,
is a thing unalterable\].<span
id="page_61_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_61_note_*.md)

   <span id="pp_57c"></span>*c*. But then \[some one may say\], 'What
proof is there that there is a conceit \[entertained by people in
general,\] of a *Nature* \[or primal principle\] different from the
conceit of an 'understanding,' &c., \[which, you tell us, are products
of this supposed first principle\]? For all the various conceits \[that
the soul falls into\], such as, 'I am ignorant,' and so on, can be
accounted for on the ground simply of an 'understanding,' &c., \[without
postulating a primal Nature which is to assume the shape of an
'understanding,' &c.\]:' <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> well, if any
one says this, I reply, 'no;' because, unless there were such a thing as
Nature, we could not account for such conceits as the following, viz.,
'Having died, having died, again, when there is a creation, let me be a
denizen of Paradise, and not of hell;' because no *products*, such as
the 'understanding,' when they have perished, can be created anew, \[any
more than a gold-bracelet, melted down, can be reproduced, though
another like it may be produced from the materials\].

|                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The soul's confounding itself with Nature is logically antecedent to its confounding itself with anything else.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_57d"></span>*d*. Moreover, it is inadmissible to say
that men's conceit of \[the identity of themselves with their\]
'understanding,' &c., is \[the *primary* cause of the soul's bondage,
and is\] not preceded by anything; because 'understanding' and the rest
\[as you will not deny\] are *effects*. Now, while it is to be expected
that there should be some predetermining agency to establish a conceit
of \[ownership in, or of one's identity with,\] any *effects*, it is
clear that it is a conceit of \[ownership, &c.,\] in respect of the
*cause*, and nothing else, that must be the predetermining agency: for
we see this in ordinary life; and our theories are bound to conform
\[deferentially\] to experience. For \[to explain,\] we see, in ordinary
life, that the conceit of \[the ownership of\] the grain, &c., produced
<span id="page_63">p. 63</span> by a field, results from the conceit of
\[the ownership of\] the field; and, from the conceit of \[the ownership
of\] gold, the conceit of \[the ownership of\] the bracelets, or other
things, formed of that gold; and, by the removal of these \[i.e., the
removal of the logically antecedent conceits, that the field, or the
gold, is one's property\], there is the removal of those, \[i.e., the
removal of the conceits that the grain, &c., and that the bracelets,
&c., the corresponding products or effects of the field and of the gold,
are one's property: and so the soul will cease to confound itself with
the 'understanding,' when it ceases to confound itself with Nature, of
which the 'understanding' is held to be a product\].

   <span id="pp_57e"></span>*e*. \[And, if it be supposed that we thus
lay ourselves open to the charge of a *regressus ad infinitum*, seeing
that, whatever we may assign as the *first* cause, we may, on our own
principles, be asked what was the 'predetermining agency' in regard to
*it*; or if it be supposed thut we are chargeable with reasoning in a
circle, when we hold that the soul's confounding itself with Nature is
the cause of <span id="page_64">p. 64</span> its *continuing* so to
confound itself, and its continuing so to confound itself is,
reciprocally, the cause why it confounds itself; we reply, that\] there
is no occasion to look for any other 'predetermining agency,' in the
case of the conceit of \[the identity of the soul with\] Nature, or in
the case of the self-continuance<span
id="page_64_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_64_note_1.md) thereof, \[i.e., of that
error of confounding one's self with Nature\]; because \[these two are
alike\] without antecedent, like seed and sprout, \[of which it is
needless to ask which is the first; the old puzzle, 'which was first,
the acorn, or the oak?' being a frivolous question\].

   <span id="pp_57f"></span>*f*. But then \[some one may say\], if we
admit the soul's bondage \[at one time\], and its freedom \[at
another\], and its discrimination \[at one time\], and its
non-discriminatian \[at another\], then this is in contradiction to the
assertion \[in [§ 19](#pp_19.md)\], that it is 'ever essentially a pure and
free intelligence;' and it is in contradiction to such texts as this,
viz., 'The absolute truth is this, that neither is there destruction
\[of the soul\], nor production \[of it\]; nor is it bound, nor is it an
effecter \[of any work\], nor is it desirous of liberation, nor is it,
indeed, *liberated*; \[seeing that that cannot desire or obtain
liberation, which was never *bound*\].'<span

inconsistency\] he repels:

| <span class="small">*   The truth must be directly discerned, and not merely accepted on the ground of Testimony, or of Inference.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_59"></span>*Aph*. 59.[\*](#pp_59.md) Moreover, it \[the
non-discrimination of Soul from Nature,\] is not to be removed by
argument; as that of a person perplexed about the points of the compass
\[is not to be removed\] without immediate cognition.

   <span id="pp_59a"></span>*a*. By 'argument' we mean thinking. The
word 'moreover' is intended to aggregate \[or take in, along with
'argument'\] 'testimony,' \[or verbal authority, which, no more than
'argument,' or inference, can remove the evil, which can be removed by
nothing short of direct intuitive *perception* of the real state of the
case\].

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

   <span id="pp_59b"></span>*b*. That is to say: the bondage, &c., of
the soul though \[granted to be\] merely verbal, are not to be removed
by merely hearing, by inferring, without immediate cognition, without
directly perceiving; just as the contrariety in regard to the \[proper\]
direction, though merely verbal \[as resulting from misdirection\], in
the case of<span id="page_67_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_67_note_1.md) a person
who is mistaken as to the points of the compass \[and hence as to his
own bearings\], is not removed by testimony, or by inference, without
immediate cognition, i.e., without \[his\] directly perceiving \[how the
points of the compass really lie, to which immediate perception
'testimony,' or 'inference,' may conduce, but the necessity of which
these *media*, or instruments of knowledge; cannot supersede\].

   <span id="pp_59c"></span>*c*. Or it \[[Aph. 59](#pp_59.md)\] may be
explained as follows, viz.: But then, \[seeing that\] it is declared, by
the assertion \[in [Aph. 56](#pp_56.md)\], viz., that 'The removal of it is
to be effected by the necessary means,' that knowledge, in the shape of
discrimination \[between soul and Nature\], is the remover of
*non*-discrimination \[in regard to the matter in question\], tell us,
is that knowledge of a like nature with the hearing <span
id="page_68">p. 68</span> \[of Testimony\], &c.? Or is it something
peculiar? A reply to this being looked for, he enounces the aphorism
\[[§ 59](#pp_59.md)\]: 'Moreover, it is not to be removed by argument,' &c.
That is to say: non-discrimination is not excluded, is not cut off, by
argument, or by testimony, unless there be discrimination as an
immediate perception; just as is the case with one who is bewildered in
regard to \[his\] direction; because the only thing to remove an
*immediate* error is an immediate individual perception \[of the truth.
For example, a man with the jaundice perceives *white* objects as if
they were *yellow*. He may *infer* that the piece of chalk which he
looks at is really white; or he may believe the *testimony* of a friend,
that it *is* white; but still nothing will remove his erroneous
*perception* of yellowness in the chalk, except a direct perception of
whiteness.

   <span id="pp_59d"></span>*d*. Having thus, then, set forth the fact
that Liberation results from the immediate discrimination \[of Soul from
<span id="page_69">p. 69</span> Nature\], the next thing to be set forth
is the 'discrimination' \[here referred to\].

   <span id="pp_59e"></span>*e*. This being the topic, in the first
place, since only if Soul and Nature exist, liberation can result from
the discrimination of the one from the other, therefore that 'instrument
of right knowledge' (*pramáṉa*) which establishes the existence of these
\[two *imperceptible* realities\] is \[first\] to be set forth:

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The evidence for things imperceptible.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_60"></span>*Aph*. 60.[\*](#pp_60.md) The knowledge of
things imperceptible is by means of Inference; as that of fire \[when
not directly perceptible,\] is by means of smoke, &c.

   <span id="pp_60a"></span>*a*. That is to say: 'of things
imperceptible,' i.e., of things not cognizable by the senses, e.g.,
Nature and the Soul, 'the knowledge,' i.e., the fruit lodged in the
soul, is brought about by means of that instrument of right knowledge
\[which may be called\] 'Inference' (*anumána*), \[but which (see Nyáya
Aphorisms, I., § 5) is, more correctly, 'the recognition of a Sign'\];
as \[the knowledge that there is\] fire \[in such and such a locality,
where we cannot directly <span id="page_70">p. 70</span> perceive it,\]
is brought about by the 'recognition of a Sign,' occasioned by smoke,
&c.

   <span id="pp_60b"></span>*b*. Moreover, it is to be understood that
that which is \[true, but yet is\] not established by 'Inference,' is
estalished by Revelation. But, since 'Inference' is the chief \[among
the instruments of knowledge\], in this \[the Sánkhya\] System,
'Inference' only is laid down \[in the aphorism,\] as the *chief* thing;
but Revelation is not disregarded \[in the Sánkhya system; as will be
seen from [Aph. 88](#pp_88.md) of this Book\].

   <span id="pp_60c"></span>*c*. He \[next\] exbibits the order of
creation of those things among which Nature is the first, and the
relation of cause and effect \[among these, severally\], preparatorily
to the argument that will be \[afterwards\] stated:

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The twenty-five Realities enumerated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_61"></span>*Aph*. 61.[\*](#pp_61) Nature (*prakṛiti*.md) is
the state of equipoise of Goodness (*sattwa*) Passion (*rajas*), and
Darkness (*tamas*): from Nature \[proceeds\] Mind (*mahat*); from Mind,
Self-consciousness (*ahankára*); from Self-consciousness, the five
Subtile Elements (*tan-mátra*), and both sets \[external and internal,\]
of Organs (*indriya*); and, from the Subtile Elements, the Gross
Elements (*sthúla-bhúta*). \[Then there is\] Soul (*purusha*). Such is
the class of twenty-five.

   <span id="pp_61a"></span>*a*. 'The state of equipoise' of the
\[three\] things called 'Goodness,' &c., is their being neither less nor
more \[one than another\]; that is to say, the state of *not* being
\[developed into\] an *effect* \[in which one or other of them
predominates\]. And thus 'Nature' is the triad of 'Qualities' (*guṉa*),
distinct from the products \[to which this triad gives rise\]: such is
the complete meaning.<span id="page_71_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_71_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_61b"></span>*b*. These things, viz., 'Goodness,' &c.,
\[though spoken of as the three Qualities\], are not 'Qualities'
(*guṉa*) in the *Vaiśeshika* sense of the word; because \[the
'Qualities' of <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> the *Vaiśeshika* system
have, themselves, *no* qualities (see Kaṇáda's 16th Aph.); while\]
*these* have the qualities of Conjunction, Disjunction, Lightness,
Force,<span id="page_72_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_72_note_1.md) Weight,
&c.<span id="page_72_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_72_note_2.md) In this
\[Sánkhya\] system, and in Scripture, &c., the word 'Quality' (*guṉa*)
is employed \[as the name of the three things in question\],<span
id="page_72_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_72_note_3.md) because they are
subservient to Soul \[and, therefore, hold a secondary rank in the scale
of being\], and because they form the *cords* \[which the word *guṉa*
also signifies\], viz., 'Mind,' &c., which consist of the three
\[so-called\] 'Qualities,' and which *bind*, as a \[cow, or other\]
brute-beast, the Soul.<span
id="page_72_fr_5"></span>[5](#page_72_note_5.md)

   <span id="pp_61c"></span>*c*. Of this \[Nature\] the principle called
'the great one' (*mahat*), viz., the principle of Understanding,
(*buddhi*), is the product. 'Self-consciousness' is a conceit \[of
separate personality\]. Of this there are two products, (1) the <span
id="page_73">p. 73</span> 'Subtile Elements' and (2) the two sets of
'Organs.' The 'Subtile Elements' are \[those of\] Sound, Touch, Colour,
Taste, and Smell. The two sets of 'Organs,' through their division into
the external and the internal, are of eleven kinds. The products of the
'Subtile Elements' are the five 'Gross Elements.' But 'Soul' is
something distinct from either product or cause. Such is the class of
twenty-five, the aggregate of things. That is to say, besides these
there is nothing.

   <span id="pp_61d"></span>*d*. He \[next\], in \[several\] aphorisms,
declares the order of the inferring \[of the existence of these
principles, the one from the other\]:

 

|                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The existence of the 'Subtile Elements' is inferred from that of the 'Gross.'*</span> |

   <span id="pp_62"></span>*Aph*. 62.[\*](#pp_62.md) \[The knowledge of the
existence\] of the five 'Subtile Elements' is \[by inference,\] from the
'Gross Elements.'

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

   <span id="pp_62a"></span>*a*. 'The knowledge, by inference,' so much
is supplied, \[to complete the aphorism, from [Aph. 60](#pp_60.md)\].

   <span id="pp_62b"></span>*b*. Earth, &c., the 'Gross Elements,' are
proved to exist, by Perception; \[and\] thereby \[i.e., from that
Perception; for Perception must precede Inference, as stated in Gotama's
5th Aphorism,\] are the 'Subtile Elements' inferred, \[the στοιχει̑α
στοιχείων of Empedocles\]. And so the application \[of the process of
inference to the case\] is as follows:

   (1) The Gross Elements, or those which have not reached the absolute
limit \[of simplification, or of the atomic\], consist of things
\[Subtile Elements, or Atoms,\] which have distinct qualities; \[the
earthy element having the distinctive quality of Odour; and so of the
others\]:

   (2) Because they are gross;

   (3) \[And everything that is gross is formed of something less gross,
or, in other words, more subtile,\] as jars, webs, &c.; \[the gross web
being formed of the less gross threads; and so of the others\].

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   And thence that of Self-consciousness.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_63"></span>*Aph*. 63.[\*](#pp_63.md) \[The knowledge of the
existence\] of Self-consciousness is \[by inference,\] from the external
and internal <span id="page_75">p. 75</span> \[organs\], and from these
\['Subtile Elements,' mentioned in [Aph. 62](#pp_62.md)\].

   <span id="pp_63a"></span>*a*. By inference from \[the existence of\]
the external and internal organs, and from \[that of\] these 'Subtile
Elements,' there is the knowledge of \[the existence of such a principle
as\] Self-consciousness.

   <span id="pp_63b"></span>*b*. The application \[of the process of
inference to the case\] is in the following \[somewhat circular\]
manner:

   (1) The Subtile Elements and the Organs are made up of things
consisting of Self-consciousness:

   (2) Because they are products of Self-consciousness:

   (3) Whatever is not so \[i.e., whatever is *not* made out of
Self-consciousness\] is not thus \[i.e., is not a *product* of
Self-consciousness\]; as the Soul, \[which, not being made up thereof,
is not a product of it\].

   <span id="pp_63c"></span>*c*. But then, if it be thus \[i.e., if it
be, as the Sánkhyas declare, that all objects, such as jars, are made up
of Self-consciousness, while Self-consciousness depends on
Understanding,' or 'Intellect,' or 'Mind,' the *first* product of
Nature' (see [Aph. 61](#pp_61).md)\], then \[some may object, that\], since
it would be the case that the Self-consciousness of the potter is the
material of the jar, the jar made by him would disappear, on the
beatification of the potter, whose internal organ \[or 'Understanding'\]
then surceases. <span id="page_76">p. 76</span> And this \[the objector
may go on to say,\] is not the case; because *another* man \[*after* the
beatification of the potter,\] recognizes that 'This is that same jar
\[which, you may remember, was fabricated by our deceased
acquaintance\].'

   <span id="pp_63d"></span>*d*. \[In reply to this we say,\] it is
*not* thus; because, on one's beatification, there is an end of only
those modifications of his internal organ \[or 'Intellect'\] which could
be causes \[as the *jar* no longer can be,\] of the emancipated soul's
*experiencing* \[either good or ill\], but not an end of the
modifications of intellect in general, nor \[an end\] of intellect
altogether: \[so that we might spare ourselves the trouble of further
argument, so far as concerns the objection grounded on the assumption
that the intellect of the potter *surceases*, on his beatification: but
we may go further, and admit, for the sake of argument, the surcease of
the 'intellect' of the beatified potter, without conceding any necessity
for the surcease of his pottery. This alternative theory of the case may
be stated as follows\]:

   <span id="pp_63e"></span>*e*. Or \[as Berkeley suggests, in his
Principles of Human knowledge, Ch. vi.\], let the Self-consciousness of
the *Deity* be the cause why jars and the like \[continue to exist\],
and <span id="page_77">p. 77</span> not the Self-consciousness of the
potter, &c., \[who may lose their Self-consciousness, whereas the Deity,
the sum of all life, *Hiraṉyagarbha* (see *Vedánta-śara*, § 62), never
loses *his* Self-consciousness, while aught living continues\].

 

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   And thence that of Intellect.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_64"></span>*Aph*. 64.[\*](#pp_64.md) \[The knowledge of the
existence\] of Intellect is \[by inference,\] from that
\[Self-consciousness, [§ 63](#pp_63.md)\].

   <span id="pp_64a"></span>*a*. That is to say: by inference from \[the
existence of\] 'that,' viz., Self-consciousness, which is a product,
there comes the knowledge of 'Intellect' (*buddhi*), the *great* 'inner
organ' (*antaẖkaraṉa*), \[hence\] called 'the great one' (*mahat*),
\[the existence of which is recognized\] under the character of the
*cause* of this \[product, viz., Self-consciousness\].

   <span id="pp_64b"></span>*b*. And so the application \[again rather
circular, of the process of inference to the case,\] is as follows:

   (1) The thing called Self-consciousness is made out of the things
that consist of the moods of judgment \[or mind\];

   (2) Because it is a thing which is a product of judgment \[proceeding
in the Cartesian order of *cogito, ergo sum*; and\]

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

   (3) Whatever is not so \[i.e., whatever is *not* made out of
judgment, or mental assurance\], is not thus \[i.e., is not a product of
mental assurance\]; as the Soul, \[which is not made out of this or of
anything antecedent\], &c.

   <span id="pp_64c"></span>*c*. Here the following reasoning is to be
understood: Every one, having first determined anything under a concept
\[i.e., under such a form of thought as is expressed by a general term;
for example, that this which presents itself is a jar, or a human body,
or a possible action of one kind or other\], after that makes the
judgment, 'This is I,' or 'This ought to be done by me,' and so forth:
so much is quite settled; \[and there is no dispute that the fact is as
here stated\]. Now, having, in the present instance, to look for some
*cause* of the thing called 'Self-consciousness' \[which manifests
itself in the various judgments just referred to\], since the relation
of cause and effect subsists between the two functions \[the occasional
conception, and the subsequent occasional judgment, which is a function
of Self-consciousness\], it is assumed, for simplicity, merely that the
relation of cause and effect exists between the two substrata to which
the \[two sets of\] functions belong; \[and this is sufficient,\]
because it follows, as a matter of course, that the occurrence of a
*function* of the effect must result from the occurrence of a *function*
of the cause; \[nothing, according to the Sánkhya, being in any <span
id="page_79">p. 79</span> product, except so far, and in such wise, as
it preexisted in the cause of that product\].

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   And thence that of Nature.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_65"></span>*Aph*. 65.[\*](#pp_65.md) \[The knowledge of the
existence\] of Nature is \[by inference,\] from that \['Intellect,' [§
64](#pp_64.md)\].

   <span id="pp_65a"></span>*a*. By inference from \[the existence of\]
'that,' viz., the principle \[of Intellect, termed\], 'the Great one,'
which is a *product*, there comes the knowledge of \[the existence of\]
Nature, as \[its\] cause.

   <span id="pp_65b"></span>*b*. The application \[of the process of
inference to the case\] is as follows:

   (1) Intellect, the affections whereof are Pleasure, Pain, and
Dulness, is produced from something which has these affections, \[those
of\] Pleasure, Pain, and Dulness:

   (2) Because, whilst it is a *product* \[and must, therefore, have
arisen from something consisting of that which itself now consists of\],
it consists of Pleasure, Pain, and Dulness; \[and\]

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

   (3) \[Every *product* that has the affections of, or that occasions,
Pleasure, Pain, or Dulness, takes its rise in something which consists
of these\]; as lovely women, &c.

   <span id="pp_65c"></span>*c*. For an agreeable woman gives pleasure
to her husband, and, therefore, \[is known to be mainly made up of, or\]
partakes of the quality of 'Goodness;' the indiscreet one gives pain to
him, and, therefore, partakes of the quality of 'Foulness;' and she who
is separated \[and perhaps forgotten,\] occasions indifference, and so
partakes of the quality of Darkness.'

   <span id="pp_65d"></span>*d*. And the appropriate refutation \[of any
objection\], in this case, is \[the principle\], that it is fitting that
the qualities of the effect should be \[in every case,\] in conformity
with the qualities of the cause.

   <span id="pp_65e"></span>*e*. Now he states how, in a different way,
we have \[the evidence of\] inference for \[the existence of\] Soul,
which is void of the relation of cause and effect that has been
mentioned, <span id="page_81">p. 81</span> \[in the four preceding
aphorisms, as existing between Nature and its various products\]:

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The argument for the existence of Soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_66"></span>*Aph*. 66.[\*](#pp_66.md) \[The existence\] of
Soul \[is inferred\] from the fact that the combination \[of the
principles of Nature into their various effects\] is for the sake of
another \[than unintelligent Nature, or any of its similarly
unintelligent products\].

   <span id="pp_66a"></span>*a*. 'Combination,' i.e., conjunction, which
is the cause \[of all products; these resulting from the conjunction of
their constituent parts\]. Since whatever has this quality, as
Nature,<span id="page_81_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_81_note_2.md) Mind, and so
on \[unlike soul, which is *not* made up of parts\], is for the sake of
some other; for this reason it is understood that soul exists: such is
the remainder, \[required to complete the aphorism\].

   <span id="pp_66b"></span>*b*. But the application \[of the argument,
in this particular case, is as follows\]:

   (1) The thing in question, viz., Nature the 'Great one,' with the
rest \[of the aggregate of the unintelligent\], has, as its fruit \[or
end\], the \[mundane\] experiences and the \[eventual\] Liberation of
some other than itself:

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

   (2) Because it is a combination \[or *compages*\];

   (3) \[And every combination,\] as a couch, or a seat, or the like,
\[is for another's use, not for its own; and its several component parts
render no mutual service\].

   <span id="pp_66c"></span>*c*. Now, in order to establish that it is
the cause of all \[products\], he establishes the *eternity* of Nature
(*prakṛiti*):

 

|                                                                      |

id="page_82_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_82_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_67a"></span>*a*. Since 'the root' (*múla*), i.e., the
cause of the twenty-three principles, \[which, with soul and the root
itself, make up the twenty-five realities recognized in the Sánkhya,\]
'has no root,' i.e., has no cause, the 'root,' viz., Nature
(*pradhána*), is 'rootless,' i.e., void of root. That is to say, there
is no other cause of Nature; because there would be <span
id="page_83">p. 83</span> a *regressus in infinitum*, \[if we were to
suppose another cause, which, by parity of reasoning, would require
another cause; and so on without end\].

   <span id="pp_67b"></span>*b*. He states the argument \[just
mentioned\] in regard to this, \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

 

|                                                                                                                                      |

   <span id="pp_68"></span>*Aph*. 68.[\*](#pp_68.md) Even if there be a
succession, there is a halt at some *one* point; and so it is merely a
name \[that we give to the point in question, when we speak of the
*root* of things, under the the name of 'Nature'\].

   <span id="pp_68a"></span>*a*. Since there would be the fault of
*regressus in infinitum*, if there were a succession of causes,—another
cause of Nature, and another \[cause\] of that one, again,—there must
be, at last, a halt, or conclusion, at some one point, somewhere or
other, at some one, uncaused, eternal thing. Therefore, that at which we
stop is the *Primal Agency* (*pra-kṛiti*); for this \[word *prakṛiti*,
usually and conveniently rendered by the term *Nature*,\] is nothing
more than a sign to denote the cause which is the *root*: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_68b"></span>*b*. But then \[some Vedántí may object

twenty-five realities is not made out; for, in addition to<span

existence\].<span id="page_85_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_85_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_69a"></span>*a*. In the discussion of the Primal Agent
\[Nature\], the cause which is the root \[of all products\], the same
side is taken by us both, the asserter \[of the Sánkhya doctrine\] and
the opponent \[Vedántí\]. This may be thus stated: As there is mention,
in Scripture, of the *production* of Nature, so, too, is there of that
of *Ignorance*, in such texts as this, viz.: 'This Ignorance, which has
five divisions, was produced from the great Spirit.'<span
id="page_85_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_85_note_*.md) Hence it must needs be
that a figurative production is intended to be asserted, in respect of
*one* of these \[and not the *literal* production of both; else we
should have no root at all\]; and, of the two, it is with *Nature* only
that a figurative production, in the shape of a manifestation through
conjunction with Soul, &c., is congruous. A production \[such as that
metaphorical one here spoken of,\] the characteristic of which is
conjunction *is* mentioned; for there is mention <span id="page_86">p.
86</span> of \[such\] a figurative origination of Soul and Nature, in a
passage of the *Kaurma* \[*Puráṉa*\], beginning, 'Of action \[or the
Primal Agency\], and knowledge \[or Soul\],' and so on. And, as there is
no mention, in Scripture, of the origin of *Ignorance*, as figurative,
*it* is *not* from eternity. And Ignorance, which consists of false
knowledge, has been declared, in an aphorism of the *Yoga*, to be \[not
a separate entity, but\] 'an affection of the mind.' Hence there is no
increase to the \[list of the twenty-five\] Realities, \[in the shape of
a twenty-sixth principle, to be styled ignorance\].

   <span id="pp_69b"></span>*b*. Or \[according to another, and more
probable, interpretation <span id="page_87">p. 87</span> of the
aphorism,\] the meaning is this, that the argument is the same in
support of both, i.e., of both Soul and Nature: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_69c"></span>*c*. But then, there being \[as has been
shown,\] a mode of arriving, by inference, at \[a knowledge of the
saving truth in regard to\] Nature, Soul, &c., whence is it that
reflexion, in the shape of discrimination \[between Soul and Nature\],
does not take place in the case of *all* \[men\]? In regard to this
point, he states \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   All do not profit by the saving truth; because it is only the best kind of people that are fully amenable to reason.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_70"></span>*Aph*. 70.[\*](#pp_70.md) There is no rule \[or
necessity, that *all* should arrive at the truth\]; because those who
are privileged \[to engage in the inquiry\] are of three descriptions.

   <span id="pp_70a"></span>*a*. For those privileged \[to enguge in the
inquiry\] are of three descriptions, through their distinction into
those who, in reflecting, are dull, mediocre, and best. Of these, by the
dull the \[Sánkhya\] arguments are frustrated \[and altogether set
aside\], by means of the sophisms that have been uttered by the
*Bauddhas*, &c. By the mediocre they \[are brought into doubt, or, in
other words,\] are made to appear as if there were equally strong
arguments on the other side, by means of arguments which really prove
the reverse \[of what these people employ them to prove\], or by <span
id="page_88">p. 88</span> arguments which are not true: \[see the
section on Fallacies in the *Tarka-sangraha*\]. But it is only the
*best* of those privileged, that reflect in the manner that has been set
forth \[in our exposition of the process of reflexion which leads to the
discriminating of Soul from Nature\]: such is the import. But there is
no rule that *all* must needs reflect in the manner so set forth: such
is the literal meaning.

   <span id="pp_70b"></span>*b*. He now, through two aphorisms, defines
'the Great one' and 'Self-consciousness'; \[the reader being presumed to
remember that Nature consists of the three 'Qualities' in equipoise, and
to be familiar with the other principles, such as the 'Subtile elements'
(see [§ 61](#pp_61).md)\]:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   By 'the Great one' is meant Mind.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_71"></span>*Aph*. 71.[\*](#pp_71.md) The first product \[of
the Primal Agent, Nature\], which is called 'the Great one,' is Mind.

   <span id="pp_71a"></span>*a*. 'Mind' (*manas*). 'Mind' \[is so
called\], because its function is 'thinking' (*manana*). By 'thinking'
is here meant 'judging' (*niśchaya*). That of which this is the function
<span id="page_89">p. 89</span> is 'intellect' (*buddhi*); and *that* is
the first product, that called 'the Great one' (*mahat*): such is the
meaning.

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The relation of Self-consciousness to Mind.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_72"></span>*Aph*. 72.[\*](#pp_72.md) 'Self-consciousness'
is that which is subsequent \[to Mind.\]

   <span id="pp_72a"></span>*a*. 'Self-consciousness,' the function of
which is a conceit \[that '*I* exist,' '*I* do this, that, and the other
thing'\], is that which is subsequent: that is to say,
'Self-consciousness' is the next after 'the Great one' \[[§
71](#pp_71.md)\].

   <span id="pp_72b"></span>*b*. Since 'Self-consciousness' is that
whose function is a conceit \[which brings out the *Ego*, in every case
of cognition, the matter of which cognition would, else, have lain
dormant in the bosom of Nature, the formless Objective\], it therefore
follows that the others \[among the phenomena of mundane existence,\]
are effects of this \[Self-consciousness\]; and so he declares \[as
follows\]:

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

 

|                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   All products, save Mind, result from Self-consciousness.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_73"></span>*Aph*. 73.[\*](#pp_73.md) To the others it
belongs to be products thereof, \[i.e., of Self-consciousness\].

   <span id="pp_73a"></span>*a*. 'To be products thereof,' i.e., to be
products of Self-consciousness: that is to say, the fact of being
products thereof belongs to the others,<span
id="page_90_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_90_note_2.md) the eleven 'Organs'
(*indriya*), the five 'Subtile elements,' and, mediately, to the
\[gross\] Elements, also, the products of the Subtile elements.

   <span id="pp_73b"></span>*b*. But then, if it be thus \[some one may
say\], you relinquish your dogma, that Nature is the cause of the whole
world. Therefore he declares \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

 

|                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature, immediately the cause of Mind, is, mediately, the cause of all other products.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_74"></span>*Aph*. 74.[\*](#pp_74.md) Moreover, mediately,
through that \[i.e., the 'Great one' ([§ 71](#pp_71).md)\] the first
\[cause, viz., Nature,\] is the cause \[of all products\]; as is the
case with the Atoms, \[the causes, though not the immediate causes, of
jars, &c.\].

   <span id="pp_74a"></span>*a*. 'Moreover, mediately,' i.e., moreover,
not in the character of the immediate cause, 'the first,' i.e., Nature,
is the Cause of 'Self-consciousness' and the rest, \[mediately,\]
through 'the Great one' and the rest; as, in the theory of the
*Vaiśeshikas*, the Atoms are the cause of a jar, or the like, only
\[mediately,\] through combinatians of two atoms, and so on: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_74b"></span>*b*. But then, since, also, both Nature and
Soul are eternal, which of them is \[really\] the cause of the
creation's commencing? In regard to this, he declares \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

 

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why Nature is the sole cause.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_75"></span>*Aph*. 75.[\*](#pp_75.md) While both \[Soul and
Nature\] are antecedent \[to all products\], since the one \[viz.,
Soul,\] is devoid \[of this character of being a cause\], it is
applicable \[only\] to the other of the two, \[viz., Nature\].

   <span id="pp_75a"></span>*a*. That is to say: 'while both,' viz.,
Soul and Nature, are preexistent to every product, still, 'since the
one,' viz., Soul, from the fact of its not being modified \[into
anything else, as clay is modified into a jar\], must be 'devoid,' or
lack the nature of a cause, 'it is applicable,' i.e., the nature of a
cause must belong, to the *other* of the two.

   <span id="pp_75b"></span>*b*. But then \[some one may say\], let
*Atoms* alone be causes; since there is no dispute \[that *these* are
causal\]. In reply to this, he says:

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

 

|                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why the theory of a plastic Nature is preferable to that of Atoms.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_76"></span>*Aph*. 76.[\*](#pp_76.md) What is limited cannot
be the substance of all \[things\].

   <span id="pp_76a"></span>*a*. That which is limited cannot be the
substance of all \[things\]; as yarn cannot be the \[material\] cause of
a jar. Therefore it would \[on the theory suggested,\] be necessary to
mention separate causes of \[all\] things severally; and it is simpler
to assume a single cause. Therefore Nature alone is the cause. Such is
the meaning.

   <span id="pp_76b"></span>*b*. He alleges Scripture in support of
this:

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Scripture declares in favour of the theory.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_77"></span>*Aph*. 77.[\*](#pp_77.md) And \[the proposition
that Nature is the cause of all is proved\] from the text of Scripture,
that the origin \[of the world\] is therefrom, \[i.e., from Nature\].

   <span id="pp_77a"></span>*a*. An argument, in the first instance, has
been set forth \[in [§ 76](#pp_76.md); for, till argument fails him, no one
falls back upon authority\]. Scripture, moreover, declares that Nature
is the cause of the world, in such terms as, 'From Nature the world
arises,' &c.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

   <span id="pp_77b"></span>*b*. But then \[some one may say\], a jar
which antecedently did not exist is seen to come into existence. Let,
then, *antecedent non-existence* be the cause \[of each product\]; since
this is an invariable antecedent, \[and, hence, a cause; 'the invariable
antecedent being denominated a cause,' if Dr. Brown, in his 6th lecture,
is to be trusted\]. To this he replies:

 

|                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Ex nihilo nihil fit.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_78"></span>*Aph*. 78.[\*](#pp_78.md) A thing is not made
out of nothing.

   <span id="pp_78a"></span>*a*. That is to say: it is not possible that
out of nothing, i.e., out of a nonentity, a thing should be made, i.e.,
an entity should arise. If an entity were to arise out of a nonentity,
then, since the character of a cause is visible in its product, the
*world*, also, would be unreal: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_78b"></span>*b*. Let the world, too, *be* unreal: what
harm is that to us? \[If any ask this,\] he, therefore, declares \[as
follows\]:

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

 

|                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Reasons why the world is not to be supposed unreal.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_79"></span>*Aph*. 79.[\*](#pp_79.md) It \[the world\] is
not unreal; because there is no fact contradictory \[to its reality\],
and because it is not the \[false\] result of depraved causes, \[leading
to a belief in what ought not to be believed\].

   <span id="pp_79a"></span>*a*. When there is the notion, in regard to
a shell \[of a pearl-oyster, which sometimes glitters like silver\],
that it is silver, its being silver is contradicted by the \[subsequent
and more correct\] cognition, that this is *not* silver. But, in the
case in question \[that of the world regarded as a reality\], no one
ever has the cognition, 'This world is *not* in the shape of an entity,'
by which \[cognition, if any one ever really had such,\] it being an
entity might be opposed.

   <span id="pp_79b"></span>*b*. And it is held that that is false which
is the result of a *depraved* cause; e.g., some one's cognition of a
\[white\] conch-shell as *yellow*, through such a fault as the jaundice,
\[which depraves his eye-sight\]. But, in the case in question, \[that
of the world regarded as a reality\], there is not such \[temporary or
occasional\] depravation \[of the senses\]; because all, at all times,
cognize the world as a reality. Therefore the world is *not* an
unreality.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

   <span id="pp_79c"></span>*c*. But then \[some one may suggest\],
*let* a nonentity be the \[substantial\] cause of the world; still the
world will not \[necessarily, therefore,\] be unreal. In regard to this,
he declares \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The product of something is something; and that of nothing, nothing.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_80"></span>*Aph*. 80.[\*](#pp_80.md) If it \[the
substantial cause,\] be an entity, then this would be the case, \[that
the product would be an entity\], from its union \[or identity\]
therewith; \[but\] if \[the cause be\] a nonentity, then how could it
possibly be the case \[that the product would be real\], since *it* is a
nonentity, \[like the cause with which it is united, in the relation of
identity\]?

   <span id="pp_80a"></span>*a*. If an *entity* were the substantial
cause \[of the world\], then, since \[it is a maxim that\] the qualities
of the cause present themselves in the product, 'this would be the
case,' i.e., it would be the case that the product was real, 'because of
union therewith,' i.e., because of the union \[of the product\] with the
reality \[which is its subatratum\]. \[But,\] since, \[by parity of
reasoning\], if a *nonentity* \[were the substantial cause\], the world
would be a nonentity, then, by reason of its being a nonentity, i.e., by
reason of the world's being \[on that supposition,\] necessarily a
non-entity, \[like its supposed cause\], how could this be the case,
\[that it would be *real*\]?

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

   <span id="pp_80b"></span>*b*. But then \[a follower of the *Mímáṅsá*
may say\], since \[it would appear that\] nonentity can take no shape
but that of nonentity, let *works* alone be the cause of the world. What
need have we of the hypothesis of 'Nature'? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Action cannot serve as a substratum.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_81"></span>*Aph*. 81.[\*](#pp_81.md) No; for *works* are
not adapted to be the *substantial* cause \[of any product\].

   <span id="pp_81a"></span>*a*. Granting that 'the uneeen' \[merit or
demerit arising from actions\] may be an *instrumental* cause, \[in
bringing about the mundane condition of the agent\], yet we never see
merit or demerit in the character of the *substantial* cause \[of any
product\]: and our theories ought to show deference to our experience.
'Nature' is to be accepted; because Liberation arises \[see [§
56](#pp_56),<span id="page_97_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_97_note_3.md) and [§
83](#pp_83.md),\] from discerning the distinction between Nature and the
Soul.

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

   <span id="pp_81b"></span>*b*. But then \[some one may say\], since
Liberation can be attained by undertaking the things directed by the
Veda, what occasion is there for \[our troubling ourselves about\]
*Nature*? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Salvation is not to be obtained by ritual observances*</span> |

   <span id="pp_82"></span>*Aph*. 82.[\*](#pp_82.md) The accomplishment
thereof \[i.e., of Liberation\] is not moreover, through Scriptural
rites: the chief end of man does not consist in this \[which is gained
through such means\]; because, since this consists of what is
accomplished through *acts*, \[and is therefore, a *product*, and not
*eternal*\], there is \[still left impending over the ritualist,\] the
liability to repetition of births.

   <span id="pp_82a"></span>*a*. 'Scriptural means,' such as sacrifices,
\[are so called\], because they are heard from \[the mouth of the
instructor in\] Scripture. Not thereby, moreover, is 'the accomplishment
thereof,' i.e., the accomplishment of Liberation; 'because one is liable
to repetition of births, by reason of the fact that it \[the supposed
Liberation,\] was accomplished by *means*,' i.e., because the \[thus
far\] liberated <span id="page_99">p. 99</span> \[soul\] is still liable
to repetition of births,<span
id="page_99_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_99_note_1.md) inasmuch as this \[its
supposed Liberation,\] is not *eternal*, \[just\] because it is \[the
result of\] *acts*. For *this* reason, the chief end of man does not
consist in this, \[which is gained through ritual observances\].

   <span id="pp_82b"></span>*b*. He shows what *does* constitute the
chief end of man:

 

|                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   In regard to the attainment of the chief end of man, the Scripture concurs with the Sánkhya.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_83"></span>*Aph*. 83.[\*](#pp_83.md) There is Scripture for
it, that he who has attained to discrimination, in regard to these
\[i.e. Nature and Soul\], has no repetition of births.

   <span id="pp_83a"></span>*a*. 'In regard to these,' i.e., in regard
to Nature and Soul, of him who has attained to discrimination, there is
a text declaring, that, in consequence of his knowledge of the
distinction, there will be no repetition of births; the text, viz.,
'*He* does not return again,'<span
id="page_99_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_99_note_4.md) &c.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

   <span id="pp_83b"></span>*b*. He states an objection to the opposite
view:

 

|                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Pain can lead only to pain, not to liberation from it.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_84"></span>*Aph*. 84.[\*](#pp_84.md) From pain
\[occasioned, e.g., to victims in sacrifice\] must come pain \[to the
sacrificer, and not *liberation* from pain\]; as there is not relief
from chilliness, by affusion of water.

   <span id="pp_84a"></span>*a*. If Liberation were to be effected by
*acts*, \[such as sacrifices\], then, since the acts involve a variety
of pains, Liberation itself \[on the principle that every effect
includes the qualities of its cause,\] would include a variety of pains;
and it would be a grief, from the fact that it must eventually end: for,
to one who is distressed by chilliness the affusion or water does not
bring liberation from his chilliness, but, rather, \[additional\]
chilliness.

   <span id="pp_84b"></span>*b*. But then \[some one may say\], the fact
that the act is productive of pain is not the *motive* \[to the
performance of sacrifice\]; but the \[real\] reason is this, that the
act is productive of *things desirable*. And, in accordance with this,
there is the text, 'By means of acts \[of sacrifice\] they may partake
of immortality,' &c. To this he replies:

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

 

|                                                                                                                                                         |

| <span class="small">*   The character of the end contemplated makes no difference in regard to the transitoriness of what is effected by works.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_85"></span>*Aph*. 85.[\*](#pp_85.md) \[Liberation cannot
arise from acts\]; because whether the end be something desirable, or
undesirable, \[and we admit that the *motive* of the sacrifice is not
the giving pain to the victim\], this makes no difference in regard to
its being the result of *acts*, \[and, therefore, not eternal, but
transitory\].

   <span id="pp_85a"></span>*a*. Grant that pain is not what is
\[intended\] to be accomplished by works done without desire, \[on the
part of the virtuous sacrificer\], still, though there *is* a difference
\[as you contend,\] between \[an act done to secure\] something
enjoyable and an act done without reference to enjoyment, this makes no
difference with repect to the fact of the Liberation's being produced by
*acts*, \[which, I repeat, *permanent* Liberation cannot be\]: there
must still again be pain; for it \[the Liberation supposed to have been
attained through works,\] must be perishable, because it is a
*production*. The text which declares that works done without desire are
instruments of Liberation has reference to *knowledge*, \[which, I

knowledge; so that these \[works\] are instruments of Liberation <span
id="page_102">p. 102</span> *mediately*: \[but you will recollect that
the present inquiry regards the *immediate* cause\].

   <span id="pp_85b"></span>*b*. \[But then, some one may say\],
supposing that Liberation may take place \[as you Sánkhyas contend,\]
through the knowledge of the distinction between Nature and Soul, still,
since, from the perishableness \[of the Liberation effected by *this*
means, as well as any other means\], mundane life may return, were both
on an equality, \[*we*, whose Liberation you Sánkhyas look upon as
transitory, and you Sánkhyas, whose Liberation we, again, look upon as
being, by parity of reasoning, in much the same predicament\]. To this
he replies:

essentially liberated, his bonds having absolutely perished, it \[i.e.,
the fruit of his saving knowledge,\] is absolute:<span

\[between his case and that of him who relies on works, and who may
thereby secure a temporary sojourn in Paradise, only to return again to
earth\].

   <span id="pp_86a"></span>*a*. Of him 'who is essentially liberated,'
who, in his very essence, is free, there is the destruction of bondage.
The bond \[see [§ 56](#pp_56.md),<span
id="page_103_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_103_note_1.md)\] is Non-discrimination
\[between Nature and Soul\]. By the removal thereof there is the
destruction, the annihilation, of Non-discrimination: and how is it
possible that there should again be a return of the mundane state, when
the destruction of Non-discrimination is *absolute*? Thus there is no
\[such\] similarity, \[between the two cases, as is imagined, by the
objector, under [§ 85. *b*.](#pp_85b.md)\].

   <span id="pp_86b"></span>*b*. It has been asserted \[in [§
61](#pp_61.md),\] that there is a class of twenty-five \[things which are
realities\], and, since these cannot be ascertained \[or made out to be
*true*\], except by <span id="page_104">p. 104</span> *proof*, therefore
he displays this; \[i.e., he shows what he *means* by proof\]:

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What is meant by evidence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_87"></span>*Aph*. 87.[\*](#pp_87.md) The determination of
something not \[previously\] lodged in both \[the Soul and the
Intellect\], nor in one or other of them, is 'right notion' (*pramá*).
What is, in the highest degree, productive thereof \[i.e., of any given
'right notion'\], is that; \[i.e., is what we mean by proof, or
evidence, (*pramáṉa*)\].

   <span id="pp_87a"></span>*a*. 'Not lodged,' i.e., not deposited in
'one rightly cognizing' (*pramátṛi*); in short, not previously known.
The 'determination,' i.e., the ascertainment \[or right comprehension\]
of such a thing, or reality, is 'right notion'; and, whether this be an
affection 'of *both*,' i.e., of Intellect, and also of Soul \[as some
hold that it is\], or of only one or other of the two, \[as others
hold,\] *either* way, 'what is, in the highest degree, productive' of
this 'right notion' is \[what we term proof, or\] evidence, (*pramáṉa*):
such is the definition of evidence in general; \[the definition of its
several species falling to beconsidered hereafter\]: such is the
meaning.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

   <span id="pp_87b"></span>*b*. It is with a view to the exclusion of
Memory, Error, and Doubt, in their order, that we employ \[when speaking
of the result of evidence,\] the expressions 'not previously known'
\[which excludes things remembered\], and 'reality' \[which excludes
mistakes and fancies\], and 'discrimination,' \[which excludes doubt\].

   <span id="pp_87c"></span>*c*. In regard to this \[topic of knowledge
and the sources of knowledge\], if 'right notion,' is spoken of as
located in the *Soul* \[see [§ 87. *a*.](#pp_87a.md)\], then the \[proof,
or\] evidence is an affection of the *Intellect*. If \[on the other
hand, the 'right notion' is spoken of as\] located in the Intellect, in
the shape of an affection \[of that the affections of which are mirrored
by the Soul\], then it \[the proof, or evidence, or whatever we may
choose to call that from which 'right notion' results,\] is just the
conjunction of an organ \[with its appropriate object; such conjunction
giving rise to sense-perception\], &c. But, if *both* the Soul's
cognition and the affections of the Intellect are spoken of as \[cases
of\] 'right notion,' then *both* of these aforesaid \[the affection of
the Intellect, in the first case, and the conjunction of an organ with
its appropriate object, &c., in the other <span id="page_106">p.
106</span> case,\] are \[to receive the name of\] proof (*pramáṉa*). You
are to understand, that, when the organ of vision, &c., are spoken of as
'evidence,' it is only as being *mediately* \[the sources of right
knowledge\].

   <span id="pp_87d"></span>*d*. How many \[kinds of\] proofs \[then,\]
are there? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   There are three kinds of evidence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_88"></span>*Aph*. 88.[\*](#pp_88.md) Proof is of three
kinds:<span id="page_106_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_106_note_1.md) there is no
establishment of more; because, if these be established, then all \[that
is true\] can be established \[by one or other of these three proofs\].

   <span id="pp_88a"></span>*a*. 'Proof is of three kinds;' that is to
say, 'perception' <span id="page_107">p. 107</span> (*pratyaksha*), 'the
recognition of signs' (*anumána*), and 'testimony' (*śabda*), are the
\[three kinds of\] proofs.

   <span id="pp_88b"></span>*b*. But then \[some one may incline to
say\], let 'comparison' \[which is reckoned, in the Nyáya, a
specifically distinct source of knowledge\], and the others \[such as
'Conjecture,' &c., which are reckoned, in like manner, in the Mímáṅsá\],
also be instruments of right knowledge, \[as well as these three\], in
\[the matter of\] the discriminating of Nature and Soul: he therefore
says, 'because, if those \[three\] be established,' &c. And, since, if
there be the three kinds of proof established, 'everything \[that is
really true\] can be established \[by means of them\], there is no
establishment of more;' no addition to the proofs can be fairly made
out; because of the cumbrousness \[that sins against the philosophical
maxim, that we are not to assume more than is necessary to account for
the case\]: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_88c"></span>*c*. For the same reason, Manu, also, has
laid down only a triad of proofs, where he says \[see the Institutes,
Ch. xii., v. 105\]: 'By that man who seeks a distinct knowledge of his
duty, \[these\] three \[sources of right knowledge\] must be well
understood, viz., Perception, Inference, and Scriptural authority in its
various shapes \[of legal institute, <span id="page_108">p. 108</span>
&c.\].' And 'Comparison,' and 'Tradition' (*aitihya*), and the like, are
included under Inference and Testimony; and 'Non-perception'
(*anupalabdhi*) and the like are included under Perception; \[for the
non-perception of an absent jar on a particular spot of ground is
nothing else than the perception of that spot of ground *without* a jar
on it\].

   <span id="pp_88d"></span>*d*. He \[next\] states the definitions of
the varieties \[of proof, having already ([§ 87](#pp_87).md) given the
general definition\]:

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Perception defined.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_89"></span>*Aph*. 89.[\*](#pp_89.md) Perception
(*pratyakska*) is that discernment which, being in<span
id="page_108_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_108_note_3.md) conjunction \[with the
thing perceived\], portrays the form thereof.

   <span id="pp_89a"></span>*a*. 'Being in conjunction,' \[literally,\]
'existing in conjunction;' <span id="page_109">p. 109</span> 'portrays
the form thereof,' i.e., assumes the form of the thing with which it is
in conjunction \[as water assumes the form of the vessel into which it
is poured\]; what 'discernment,' or affection of the Intellect, \[does
*this*\], that \[affection of the Intellect (see Yoga Aphorisms, I., § 5
and § 8. *b*.)\] is the evidence \[called\] Perception: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_89b"></span>*b*. But then, \[some one may say,\] this
\[definition of Perception ([§ 89](#pp_89).md)\] does not extend \[as we
conceive it ought, and presume it is intended, to do,\] to the
perception, by adepts in the *Yoga*, of things past, future, or
concealed \[by stone walls, or such intervening things as interrupt
ordinary perception\]; because there is, here, 'no form of the thing, in
*conjunction*' \[with the mind of him who perceives it, while absent\]:
having pondered this doubt, he corrects it by \[stating, as follows,\]
the fact, that this \[supernatural sort of perception\] is not what he
intends to define:

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

 

|                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The definition not to be blamed, though it should not apply to the perceptions of the mystic.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_90"></span>*Aph*. 90.[\*](#pp_90.md) It is not a fault \[in
the definition, that it does not apply to the perceptions of adepts in
the *Yoga*\]; because that of the adepts in the *Yoga* is not an
*external* perception.

   <span id="pp_90a"></span>*a*. That is to say: it is only
*sense*-perception that is to be here defined; and the adepts of the
Yoga do not perceive through the *external* \[organs of sense\].
Therefore there is no fault \[in our definition\]; i.e., there is no
*failure* to include the perceptions of these; \[because there is no
*intention* to include them\].

   <span id="pp_90b"></span>*b*. \[But, although this reply is as much
as the objector has any right to expect,\] he states the real
justification \[of the definition in question\]:

 

|                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   But the definition does apply to the perceptions of the mystic.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_91"></span>*Aph*. 91.[\*](#pp_91.md) Or, there is no fault
\[in the definition\], because of the conjunction, with *causal* things,
of that \[mystical mind\] which has attained exaltation.<span
id="page_110_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_110_note_4.md)

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

   <span id="pp_91a"></span>*a*. Or, be it so that the perception of the
*Yogí*, also, shall be the thing to be defined; still there is no fault
\[in our definition, [§ 89](#pp_89.md)\]; it does not fail to extend \[to
this, also\]; since the mind of the *Yogí*, in the exaltation gained
from the habitude produced by concentration, *does* come into
conjunction with things \[as existent\] in their causes, \[whether or
not with the things as developed into products perceptible by the
external senses\].

   <span id="pp_91b"></span>*b*. Here the word rendered 'causal'
(*lína*) denotes the things, *not* in conjunction \[with the senses\],
alluded to by the objector \[in [§ 89. *b*.](#pp_89b.md)\]; for *we*, who
assert that effects *exist* \[from eternity, in their causes, before
taking the shape of effects, and, likewise, in these same causes, when
again resolved into their causes\], hold that even what is past, &c.,
still essentially exists, and that, hence, its conjunction \[with the
mind of the mystic, or the clairvoyant,\] is possible.

|                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Objection, that the definition does not apply to the perceptions of the 'Lord.'*</span> |

   <span id="pp_91c"></span>*c*. But then, \[some one may say,\] still
this \[definition\] does not extend to the *Lord's* perceptions;
because, since these are from everlasting, they cannot <span
id="page_112">p. 112</span> *result* from \[emergent\] conjunction. To
this he replies:

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   That any 'Lord' exists is not proved.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_92"></span>*Aph*. 92.[\*](#pp_92.md) \[This objection to
the definition of Perception has no force\]; because it is not proved
that there *is* a Lord (*íśwara*).

   <span id="pp_92a"></span>*a*. That there is no fault \[in the
definition of Perception\], because there is no proof that there *is* a
Lord, is supplied \[from [§ 90](#pp_90.md)\].

   <span id="pp_92b"></span>*b*. And this demurring to there being any
'Lord' is merely in accordance with<span
id="page_112_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_112_note_3.md) the arrogant dictum of
\[certain\] partisans \[who hold an opinion not recognized by the
majority\]. Therefore, it is to be understood, the expression employed
is, 'because it is *not proved* that there is a Lord,' but not the
expression, 'because there *is no* Lord,'

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

   <span id="pp_92c"></span>*c*. But, on the implication<span
id="page_113_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_113_note_1.md) that there *is* a
'Lord,' what we mean to speak of \[in our definition of Perception, ([§
89](#pp_89).md),\] is merely the being of the \[same\] kind with what is
produced by conjunction \[of a sense-organ with its object; and the
perceptions of the 'Lord' may be of the same *kind* with such
perceptions, though they were not to come from the same *source*\].

   <span id="pp_92d"></span>*d*. Having pondered the doubt, '*How*
should the Lord not be proved \[to exist\] by the Scripture and the Law,
\[which declare his existence\]?' he states a dilemma which excludes
\[this\]:

 

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A dilemma, to exclude proof that there is any 'Lord.'*</span> |

   <span id="pp_93"></span>*Aph*. 93.[\*](#pp_93.md) \[And, further,\] it
is not proved that he \[the 'Lord,'\] exists; because \[whoever exists
must be either free or bound; and\], of free and bound, he can be
neither the one nor the other.

   <span id="pp_93a"></span>*a*. The 'Lord' whom you imagine, tell us,
is he free from troubles, &c.? Or is he in bondage through these? <span
id="page_114">p. 114</span> Since he is not, cannot be, either the one
or the other, it is not proved that there is a 'Lord:' such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_93b"></span>*b*. He explains this very point:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The force of the dilemma.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_94"></span>*Aph*. 94.[\*](#pp_94.md) \[Because,\] either
way, he would be inefficient.

   <span id="pp_94a"></span>*a*. Since, if he were free, he would have
no desires, &c., which \[as compulsory motives,\] would instigate him to
create; and, if he were bound, he would be under delusion; he must be
\[on either alternative,\] unequal to the creation, &c. \[of this
world\].

   <span id="pp_94b"></span>*b*. But then, \[it may be asked,\] if such
be the case, what becomes of the Scripture-texts which declare the
'Lord?' To this he replies:

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

 

|                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The import of the texts which speak of the 'Lord.'*</span> |

   <span id="pp_95"></span>*Aph*. 95.[\*](#pp_95.md) \[The Scriptural texts
which make mention of the 'Lord' are either glorifications of the
liberated Soul, or homages to the recognized<span
id="page_115_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_115_note_3.md) \[deities of the Hindu
pantheon\].<span id="page_115_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_115_note_4.md)

   <span id="pp_95a"></span>*a*. That is to say: accordingly as the case
may be, *some* text \[among those in which the term 'Lord' occurs,\] is
intended, in the shape of a glorification \[of Soul\], as the 'Lord,'
\[as Soul is held to be\], merely in virtue of junction \[with Nature\],
to incite \[to still deeper contemplation\], to exhibit, as what is to
be known, the liberated Soul, i.e., absolute Soul in general; and some
other text, declaratory, for example, of creatorship, &c., preceded by
resolution \[to create, is intended\] to extol \[and to purify the mind
of the contemplator, by enabling him to take a part in extolling\] the
eternity, &c., of the familiarly known<span
id="page_115_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_115_note_3.md) Brahmá, <span
id="page_116">p. 116</span> Vishṉu, Śiva, or other *non*-eternal 'Lord;'
since these, though possessed of the conceit \[of individuality\], &c.,
\[and, in so far, liable to perish\], have immortality, &c., in a
secondary sense; \[seeing that the Soul, in *every* combination, is
immortal, though the combination itself is not so\].

   <span id="pp_95b"></span>*b*. But then, \[some one may say\], even if
it were thus \[as alleged under [§ 95](#pp_95.md)\], what is heard in
Scripture, \[viz.\], the fact that it \[viz., Soul\] is the *governor*
of Nature, &c., would not be the case; for, in the world, we speak of
government in reference only to modifications \[preceded and
determined\] by resolutions \[that so and so shall take place\], &c. To
this he replies:

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

 

|                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul, like the lode stone, acts not by resolve, but through proximity.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_96"></span>*Aph*. 96.[\*](#pp_96.md) The governorship
\[thereof, i.e., of Soul over Nature\] is from \[its\] proximity
thereto, \[not from its resolving to act thereon\]; as is the case with
the gem, \[the lodestone, in regard to iron\].

   <span id="pp_96a"></span>*a*. If it were alleged that \[its, Soul's\]
creativeness, or \[its\] governorship, was through a *resolve* \[to
create, or to govern\], then this objection \[brought forward under [§
95. *b*.](#pp_95b.md)\] would apply. But \[it is not so; for,\] by *us*
\[Sánkhyas,\] it is held that the Soul's governorship, in the shape of
creatorship, or the like, is merely from \[its\] *proximity* \[to
Nature\]; 'as is the case with the \[lodestone\] gem.'

   <span id="pp_96b"></span>*b*. As the gem, the lodestone, is attracted
by iron merely by proximity, without resolving \[either to act or to be
acted on\], &c., so, by the mere conjunction of the primal Soul, Nature
is changed into the principle \[called\] the 'Great one,' \[or Mind,
(see [§ 61. *c*.](#pp_61c).md)\]. And in this alone consists \[what we
speak of as\] its acting as *creator* towards that which is superadded
to it: such is the meaning

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

   <span id="pp_96c"></span>*c*. And thus it is declared, \[in some one
of the Puráṉas<span id="page_118_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_118_note_1.md)\]:
'As the iron acts, whilst the gem \[the lodestone,\] stands void of
volition, just so this world is created by a deity who is mere
Existence. Thus it is, that there are, in the Soul, both agency
\[seemingly,\] and non-agency, \[really\]. It is *not* an agent,
inasmuch as it is void of volition; \[and it *is*\] an agent, merely
through approximation \[to Nature\].'

   <span id="pp_96d"></span>*d*. In respect of worldly products, also,
animal souls overrule, merely through their approximation \[to Nature\]:
so he declares \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

 

|                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   In like manner, embodied souls do not energize.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_97"></span>*Aph*. 97.[\*](#pp_97.md) In the case of
individual products, also, \[the apparent agency\] of animal souls \[is
solely through proximity\].

   <span id="pp_97a"></span>*a*. 'The agency is solely through
proximity:' so much is supplied \[from [§ 96](#pp_96.md)\].

   <span id="pp_97b"></span>*b*. The meaning is this, that, in the case,
also, of particular productions,—the creation, &c., of things individual
\[as contradistinguished from that of all things in the lump, (see
*Vedánta-sára*, § 67)\],—animal souls, i.e., souls in which the
intellects \[of individuals\] reflect themselves \[see [§ 99.
*a*.](#pp_99a.md)\], overrule, merely through proximity, but not through
any effort; seeing that these \[animal souls\] are none other than the
motionless Thought.

   <span id="pp_97c"></span>*c*. But then, \[some one may say\], if
there were no eternal and omniscient 'Lord,' through the doubt of a
blind tradition, \[in the absence of an intelligently effective
guardianship\], the *Vedas* would cease to be an authority; \[a
possibility which, of course, cannot be entertained for an instant\]. To
this he replies:

true, the declaration of the texts or sense of the Vedas, where *these*
are the speakers, *is* evidence \[altogether indisputable\].'

   <span id="pp_98b"></span>*b*. But then, if Soul, by its simple
proximity \[to Nature ([§ 96](#pp_96).md)\], is an overruler in a
*secondary* sense \[only of the term,—as the magnet may be said, is a
secondary sense, to draw the iron, while the conviction is entertained,
that, actually and literally, the iron draws the magnet\],—who is the
*primary* \[or actual,\] overruler? In reference to this, he says:

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   It is in the shape of the internal organ, that Nature affects Soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_99"></span>*Aph*. 99.[\*](#pp_99.md) The internal
organ,<span id="page_121_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_121_note_1.md) through its
being enlightened thereby \[i.e., by Soul\], is the overruler; as is the
iron, \[in respect of the magnet\].

   <span id="pp_99a"></span>*a*. The internal organ, i.e., the
understanding, is the overruler, through its fancying itself to be Soul,
\[as it does fancy,\] by reason of its being enlightened by the Soul,
through its happening to reflect itself in \[and contemplate itself
in,\] Soul; 'just as the iron,' that is to say, as the attracting iron,
though inactive, draws \[the magnet\], in consequence of \[its\] mere
proximity, \[and so acquires magnetism by magnetic induction\].

   <span id="pp_99b"></span>*b*. He \[now, having discussed the evidence
that consists in direct perception,\] states the definition of inference
(*anumána*):

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

 

|                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Inference defined.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_100"></span>*Aph*. 100.[\*](#pp_100.md) The knowledge of
the connected \[e.g., fire\], through perception of the connexion
\[e.g., of fire with smoke\], is inference.

   <span id="pp_100a"></span>*a*. That is to say: inference \[or
conviction of a general truth,\] is \[a kind of\] evidence consisting in
a \[mental\] modification, \[which is none other than\] the knowledge of
the connected, i.e., of the constant accompanier, through the knowledge
of the constant accompaniment: by 'connexion' (*pratibandha*) here being
meant 'constant attendedness' (*vyápti*); and through the perception
thereof \[it being that the mind has possession of any general
principle\].

   <span id="pp_100b"></span>*b*. But a conclusion (*anumiti*) is
knowledge of the soul; \[whilst an Inference, so far forth as it is an
instrument in the establishment of knowledge deducible from it, is an
affection of the internal organ, or understanding (see [§ 87.
*c*.](#pp_87c).md)\]

   <span id="pp_100c"></span>*c*. He \[next\] defines testimony
(*śabda*):

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Valid testimony defined.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_101"></span>*Aph*. 101.[\*](#pp_101.md) Testimony \[such as
is entitled to the name of evidence, is a declaration by one worthy \[to
be believed\].

   <span id="pp_101a"></span>*a*. Here 'fitness' means 'suitableness;'
and so the evidence which is called 'Testimony' is the knowledge arising
from a suitable declaration: such is the meaning. And \[while this
belongs to the understanding, or internal organ (see [§ 100.
*b*.](#pp_100b).md)\] the result is that \[knowledge\] in the Soul, \[which
is called,\] 'knowledge by hearing' (*śabda-bodha*).

   <span id="pp_101b"></span>*b*. He \[next\] volunteers to tell us what
is the use of his setting forth \[the various divisions of\] evidence:

 

|                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why the kinds of Evidence have been here set forth.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_102"></span>*Aph*. 102.[\*](#pp_102.md) Since the
establishment of \[the existence of\] both \[soul and non-soul\] is by
means of evidence, the decaration thereof \[i.e., of the kinds of
evidence, has been here made\].

   <span id="pp_102a"></span>*a*. It is only by means of evidence that
both Soul and non-soul are established as being distinct, \[the one from
the <span id="page_124">p. 124</span> other\]: therefore has this, viz.,
evidence, been here declared: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_102b"></span>*b*. Among these \[several kinds of
proof\], he \[now\] describes that one by which, especially, viz., by a
proof which is one kind of inference, Nature and Soul are here to be
established discriminatively:

 

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The existence of Soul and Nature argued from analogy.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_103"></span>*Aph*. 103.[\*](#pp_103.md) The establishment
of both \[Nature and Soul\] is by analogy.

   <span id="pp_103a"></span>*a*. \[Analogy (*sámányato dṛishṭa*) is
that kind of evidence which is employed in the case\] where, by the
force \[as an argument,\] which the residence of any property in the
subject derives from a knowledge of its being constantly accompanied
\[by something which it may therefore betoken\], when we have had
recourse to \[as the means of determining this constant accompaniment,\]
what is, for instance, generically of a perceptible kind, \[where, under
such circumstances, we repeat,\] anything of a *different* kind, i.e.,
*not* cognizable by the senses, is established; as when, <span
id="page_125">p. 125</span> for example, having apprehended a constant
accompaniment, \[e.g., that an act implies an instrument\], by taking
into consideration such instruments as axes, &c., which are of earthy
and other kinds, a quite heterogeneous, imperceptible, instrument of
*knowledge*, viz., \[the instrument named\] Sense, is established \[or
inferred to exist\]; such is what we mean by Analogy; and it is by
*this* \[species of inference\], that both, \[viz.,\] Nature and Soul
are proved \[to exist\]: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_103b"></span>*b*. Of these \[viz., Nature and Soul,\]
the argument from analogy for \[the existence of\] Nature is as follows:
the Great Principle \[viz., Understanding (see [§ 61. *c*.](#pp_61c).md)\]
is formed out of the things \[called\] Pleasure, Pain, and Delusion,
\[to the aggregate of which three in equipoise (see [§ 61](#pp_61).md) the
name of Nature is given\]; because, whilst it is \[undeniably,\] a
production, it has the characters of Pleasure, Pain, and Delusion; just
as a bracelet, or the like, formed of gold, or the like; \[has the
characteristic properties <span id="page_126">p. 126</span> of the gold,
or the like, and is thereby known to have been formed out of gold, or
the like\].

   <span id="pp_103c"></span>*c*. But, \[as regards tht argument from
analogy, in proof of the existence\] of Soul, \[it is, as stated before,
under [§ 66](#pp_66.md), to the following effect\]: Nature is for the sake
of *another*; because it is something that acts as a combination; as a
house, for instance, \[which is a combination of various parts combined
for the benefit of the tenant\]. In this instance, having gathered, in
regard to houses, &c., the fact established on sense-perception, that
they exist for the sake of \[organized\] bodies, for example, something
of a different kind therefrom, \[i.e., from Nature, viz.\], Soul, is
inferred \[by analogy,\] as something other than Nature, &c., \[which,
as being a compound thing, is not designed for itself\]: such is the
meaning.

   <span id="pp_103d"></span>*d*. But then \[some one may say\], since
Nature is eternal, and exertion is habitual to her, \[and the result of
her action is the bondage of the Soul\], there should constantly be
experience \[whether of pleasure or of pain\], and, hence, no such thing
as thorough emancipation. To this he replies:

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   When it is that experience ceases.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_104"></span>*Aph*. 104.[\*](#pp_104.md) Experience
\[whether of pain or pleasure, ends with the discernment of\] Thought,
\[or Soul, as contradistinguished from Nature\].

   <span id="pp_104a"></span>*a*. By 'Thought' \[we mean\] soul.
Experience \[whether of pain or pleasure,\] ceases, on the discerning
thereof. As 'antecedent non-existence,' though devoid of a beginning,
\[see *Tarka-sangraha*, § 92\], surceases \[when the thing antecedently
non-existent begins to be\], so, eternal Nature \[eternal, as regards
the absence of any beginning,\] continues \[no further than\] till the
discernment of the difference \[between Nature and Soul\]; so that
experience \[whether of pain or pleasure,\] does *not* at all times
occur: such is the state of the case.

   <span id="pp_104b"></span>*b*. \[But some one say\], if Nature be
agent, and Soul experiencer, then it must follow \[which seems
unreasonable,\] that another is the experiencer of \[the results of\]
the acts done by one different. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The fruit of the action is not always the agent's.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_105"></span>*Aph*. 105.[\*](#pp_105.md) The experience of
the fruit *may* belong even to another than the agent; as in the case of
food, &c.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

   <span id="pp_105a"></span>*a*. As it belongs to the cook to prepare
the food, &c., and to one who was not the agent, viz., the master, to
enjoy the fruit \[thereof, i.e., the fruit of the cook's actions\], so
is the case here, also.

   <span id="pp_105b"></span>*b*. Having stated an exoteric principle
\[which may serve, in practice, to silence, by the *argumentum ad
hominem*, him on whose principles it may be valid\], he \[next\]
declares his own doctrine, \[in regard to the doubt started under [§
104. *b*.](#pp_104b.md)\]:

 

|                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   To suppose that Soul acts and experiences is an error.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_106"></span>*Aph*. 106.[\*](#pp_106.md) Or, \[to give a
better account of the matter than that given in [§ 105](#pp_105.md)\],
since it is from non-discrimination that it is derived, the notion that
the *agent* \[soul being mistaken for an agent,\] has the fruit \[of the
act is a wrong notion\].

   <span id="pp_106a"></span>*a*. The soul is neither an agent nor a
patient; but, from the fact that the Great Principle \[the actual agent
(see [§ 97. *b*.](#pp_97b).md)\] is reflected in it, there arises the
*conceit* of its being an agent. 'Or, since it is from
non-discrimination;' that is to say, because it is from the failure to
discriminate between Nature and Soul, that this takes place, i.e., that
conceit takes place, that it is the *agent* that experiences the fruit;
\[whereas the actual agent is Nature, which, being unintelligent, can
experience neither pain nor pleasure\].

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

   <span id="pp_106b"></span>*b*. The opposite of this \[wrong view,
referred to in [§ 106](#pp_106.md),\] he states \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul is really neither agent nor experiencer.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_107"></span>*Aph*. 107.[\*](#pp_107.md) And, when the truth
is told, there is \[seen to be\] neither \[agency, in Soul, nor
experience\].

   <span id="pp_107a"></span>*a*. 'When the truth is told' \[and
discerned\], i.e., when, by means of evidence, Nature and Soul are
*perceived* \[in their entire distinctness, one from the other\], 'there
is neither,' i.e., neither the condition \[as regards soul,\] of an
agent nor that of a patient.

   <span id="pp_107b"></span>*b*. Having discussed \[the topic of\]
evidence, he \[now\] states the distribution of the subject-matter of
evidence:

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

 

|                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What is perceptible, under certain circumstances, may be imperceptible, under others.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_108"></span>*Aph*. 108.[\*](#pp_108.md) \[A thing may be\]
an object \[perceptible\], and also \[at another time,\] not an object,
through there being, in consequence of great distance, &c., a want of
\[conjunction of the sense with the thing\], or \[on the other hand,\]
an appliance of the sense \[to the thing\].

   <span id="pp_108a"></span>*a*. An object \[is a perceived object\],
through the proximity, or conjunction, of the sense \[with the object\].
\[A thing may be\] not an object \[perceived\], through the want of the
sense, i.e., through the want of conjunction \[between the sense and
what would otherwise be its object\]. And \[this\] want of conjunction
\[may result\] from the junction's being prevented by great distance,
&c.

|                                                              |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What may prevent perception.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_108b"></span>*b*. \[To explain the '&c.,' and to
exemplify the causes that may prevent the conjunction, required in order
to perception, between the thing and the sense, we may remark, that\] it
is in consequence of great distance, that a bird \[flying very high up\]
in the sky is not perceived; \[then again,\] in consequence of extreme
proximity, the collyrium located in the eye \[is not perceived by the
eye itself\]; a thing placed in \[the inside of, or on the opposite side
of,\] a wall \[is not perceived\], in consequence of the obstruction;
from distraction of mind, the unhappy, or other \[agitated person\],
does not perceive the thing that is at his side \[or under his very
nose\]; through its subtilty, <span id="page_131">p. 131</span> an atom
\[is not perceived\]; nor is a very small sound, when overpowered by the
sound of a drum; and so on.

   <span id="pp_108c"></span>*c*. How \[or, for which of the possible
reasons just enumerated,\] comes the imperceptibleness of *Nature*? In
regard to this, he declares:

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The subtility of Nature.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_109"></span>*Aph*. 109.[\*](#pp_109.md) Her
imperceptibleness arises from \[her\] subtility.

   <span id="pp_109a"></span>*a*. 'Her,' i.e., *Nature's*,
imperceptibleness is from subtilty. By subtilty is meant the fact of
being difficult to investigate; not \[as a Naiyáyika might, perhaps,
here prefer understanding the term,\] the consisting of atoms; for
Nature is \[not atomic, in the opinion of the Sánkhyas, but\]
all-pervasive.

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

   <span id="pp_109b"></span>*b*. How, then, \[it may be asked,\] is
\[the existence of\] Nature determined? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature inferred from the existence of productions.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_110"></span>*Aph*. 110.[\*](#pp_110.md) \[Nature exists;\]
because her existence is gathered from the beholding of productions.

   <span id="pp_110a"></span>*a*. As the knowledge of \[there being such
things as\] atoms comes from the beholding of jars, &c., \[which are
agglomerations\], so the knowledge of Nature comes from the beholding of
products which have the three Qualities; \[(see [§ 62. *a*.](#pp_62a).md)
and the existence of which implies a cause, to which the name of Nature
is given, in which these constituents exist from eternity\].

   <span id="pp_110b"></span>*b*. Some \[the Vedántís,\] say that the
world has *Brahma* as its cause; others \[the Naiyáyikas\], that it has
atoms as its cause; but our seniors \[the transmitters of the Sánkhya
doctrine\], that it has *Nature* as its cause. So he sets forth a doubt
\[which might naturally found itself\] thereon:

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

 

|                                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A doubt thrown on the existence of Nature, by the contradiction of dissentients.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_111"></span>*Aph*. 111.[\*](#pp_111.md) If \[you throw out
the doubt that\] it \[viz., the existence of Nature,\] is not
established, because of the contradiction of asserters \[of other views,
then you will find an answer in the next aphorism\].

   <span id="pp_111a"></span>*a*. 'Because of the the contradiction of
asserters \[of the Vedánta or Nyáya\], *it* is not established,' i.e.,
Nature \[as asserted by the Sánkhyas,\] is not established.

   <span id="pp_111b"></span>*b*. But then, \[to set forth the objection
of these counter-asserters\], if a product existed antecedently to its
production \[as that product\], *then* an eternal Nature \[such as you
Sánkhyas contend for,\] would be proved to exist as the \[necessary\]
substratum thereof; since you will declare that a cause is inferred only
as the \[invariable\] accompanier of an effect; but it is denied, by us
asserters \[of the Vedánta, &c.\], that the effect *does* exist
\[antecedently to its production; well,\] *if* \[this doubt be thrown
out\]: such is the meaning \[of the aphorism\].

   <span id="pp_111c"></span>*c*. He states \[his\] doctrine \[on this
point\]:

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Mutual denials settle nothing.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_112"></span>*Aph*. 112.[\*](#pp_112.md) Still, since<span
id="page_134_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_134_note_1.md) each \[doctrine\] is
established in the opinion of each, a \[mere unsupported\] denial is not
\[decisive\].

   <span id="pp_112a"></span>*a*. If one side were disproved merely by
the dissent of the opponent, then \[look you,\] there is dissent against
the other side, too: so how could *it* be established? If the one side
is established by there being inevitably attendant the recognition of
the constant accompanier, on the recognition of that which is constantly
accompanied \[by it\], it is the same with *my* \[side\], also:
therefore \[my\] inference from effect \[to cause\] is not to be denied
\[in this peremptory fashion\].

   <span id="pp_112b"></span>*b*. Well, then, \[the opponent may say\],
let \[the inference of\] cause from effect be granted; how is it that
this \[cause\] is *Nature*, and nothing else, \[such as Atoms, for
instance\]? To this he replies:

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

 

|                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature the only hypothesis consistent with what appears.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_113"></span>*Aph*. 113.[\*](#pp_113.md) Because \[if we
were to infer any other cause than Nature,\] we should have a
contradiction to the threefold \[aspect which things really exhibit\].

   <span id="pp_113a"></span>*a*. Quality is threefold \[see [§ 61.
*a*.](#pp_61a.md)\], viz., Goodness, Passion, and Darkness: there would be
a contradiction to *these*: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_113b"></span>*b*. The drift here is as follows: If the
character of cause \[of all things around us\] belonged to Atoms, or the
like, then there would be a contradiction to the fact of being an
aggregate of pleasure, pain, and delusion, which is recognizable in the
world; \[because nothing, we hold, can exist in the effect, which did
not exist in the cause, and pleasure, pain, &c., are no properties of
Atoms\].

   <span id="pp_113c"></span>*c*. He now repels the doubt as to whether
the production of an effect is that of what existed \[antecedently\], or
of what did not exist:

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

 

|                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What never existed will never exist.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_114"></span>*Aph*. 114.[\*](#pp_114.md) The production of
what is no entity, as a man's horn, does not take place.

   <span id="pp_114a"></span>*a*. Of that which, like the horn of a man,
is not an entity, even the production is impossible: such is the
meaning. And so the import is, that that effect alone which
\[antecedently\] exists is \[at any time\] produced.

   <span id="pp_114b"></span>*b*. He states an argument why an effect
must be some \[previously existent\] entity:

 

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A product cannot be of nothing.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_115"></span>*Aph*. 115.[\*](#pp_115.md) Because of the
rule, that there must be some material \[of which the product may
consist\].

   <span id="pp_115a"></span>*a*. And only when both are extant is
there, from the presence of the cause, the presence of the effect.
Otherwise, everywhere and always, every \[effect\] might be produced;
\[the presence of the cause being, on the supposition, superfluous\].
This he insists upon \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

 

|                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Else, anything might occur at any time, anywhere.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_116"></span>*Aph*. 116.[\*](#pp_116.md) Because everything
is not possible everywhere and always \[which might be the case\] if
materials could be dispensed with\].

   <span id="pp_116a"></span>*a*. That is to say: because, in the world,
we see that everything is *not* possible, i.e., that everything is *not*
produced; 'everywhere,' i.e., in every place; 'always,' i.e., at all
times.

   <span id="pp_116b"></span>*b*. For the following reason, also, he
declares, there is no production of what existed not \[antecedently\]:

 

|                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Effects preexist, potentially, in their causes.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_117"></span>*Aph*. 117.[\*](#pp_117.md) Because it is that
which is competent \[to the making of anything\] that makes what is
possible, \[as a product of it\].

   <span id="pp_117a"></span>*a*. Because the being the material \[of
any future product\] is nothing else than the fact of \[being it,
*potentially*, i.e., of\] having the competency to be the product; and
\[this\] competency is nothing else than the product's condition as that
of what has not yet come to pass: therefore, since 'that which is
competent,' viz., the cause, makes the product which is 'possible' \[to
be made out of it\], it is not of any *nonentity* that the production
takes <span id="page_138">p. 138</span> place, \[but of an entity, whose
*esse*, antecedently, was *possibility*\]: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_117b"></span>*b*. He states another argument:

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The product is nothing else than the cause.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_118"></span>*Aph*. 118.[\*](#pp_118.md) And because it
\[the product,\] is \[nothing else than\] the cause, \[in the shape of
the product\].

   <span id="pp_118a"></span>*a*. It is declared, in Scripture, that,
previously to production, moreover, there is no difference between the
cause and its effect; and, since it is thereby settled that a product is
an entity, production is not of what \[previously\] existed not: such is
the meaning.

   <span id="pp_118b"></span>*b*. He ponders a doubt:.

 

|                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A doubt whether that which is can be said to become.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_119"></span>*Aph*. 119.[\*](#pp_119.md) If \[it be alleged
that\] there is no possibility of that's *becoming* which already *is*
\[then the answer will be found in the next aphorism\].

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

   <span id="pp_119a"></span>*a*. That is to say: but then, if it be
thus \[that every effect exists antecedently to its production\], since
the effect \[*every* effect,\] must be eternal \[without beginning\],
there is no possibility of \[or room for\] the adjunction of *becoming*,
the adjunction of *arising*, in the case of a product which is
\[already, by hypothesis,\] in the shape of an entity; because the
employment of \[the term\] '*arising*' \[or the fact of being produced\]
has reference solely to what did *not* exist \[previously\]; if this be
urged: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_119b"></span>*b*. He declares the doctrine \[in regard
to this point\]:

 

|                                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Production is only manifestation; and so of the opposite.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_120"></span>*Aph*. 120.[\*](#pp_120.md) No; \[do not argue
that what *is* cannot become; for\] the employment and the
non-employment \[of the term 'production'\] are occasioned by the
*manifestation* \[and the non-manifestation of what is spoken of as
produced, or not\].

   <span id="pp_120a"></span>*a*. 'No;' the view stated \[in [§
119](#pp_119.md)\] is not the right one: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_120b"></span>*b*. As the whiteness of white cloth
\[which has become\] dirty is brought manifestly out by means of
washing, &c., <span id="page_140">p. 140</span> so, by the operation of
the potter, is the pot brought into manifestness; \[whereas\], on the
blow of a mallet, it becomes hidden, \[and no longer appears as a
*pot*\].

   <span id="pp_120c"></span>*c*. And manifestation \[is no fiction of
ours; for it\] is seen; for example, that of oil, from sesamum-seeds, by
pressure; of milk, from the cow, by milking; of the statue, which
resided in the midst of the stone, by the operation of the sculptor; of
husked rice, from rice in the husk, by threshing; &c.

   <span id="pp_120d"></span>*d*. Therefore, the employment and the
non-employment of the \[term\] 'the *production* of an effect' are
dependent on *manifestation*, dependent on the manifestation of the
*effect*: that is to say, the employment of \[the term\] 'production' is
in consequence of the manifestation \[of what is spoken of as
produced\]; and the non-employment of \[the term\] 'production' is in
consequence of there being no manifestation \[of that which is,
therefore, not spoken of as produced\]; but \[the employment of the term
'production' is\] not in consequence of that's becoming an entity which
was not an entity.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

   <span id="pp_120e"></span>*e*. But if \[the employment of the term\]
'production' is occasioned by \[the fact of\] *manifestation*, by what
is occasioned \[the employment of the term\] *destruction*?<span
id="page_141_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_141_note_1.md) To this he replies:

 

|                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What is meant by destruction.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_121"></span>*Aph*. 121.[\*](#pp_121.md) Destruction \[of
anything\] is the resolution \[of the thing spoken of as destroyed,\]
into the cause \[from which it was produced\].

   <span id="pp_121a"></span>*a*. The resolution, by the blow of a
mallet, of a jar into its cause \[i.e., into the particles of clay which
constituted the jar\], to *this* are due both \[the employment of\] the
term 'destruction,' and the kind of action \[or behaviour\] belonging to
anything \[which is termed its destruction\].<span
id="page_141_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_141_note_4.md)

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

   <span id="pp_121b"></span>*b*. \[But some one may say\], if there
were \[only\] a resolution \[of a product into that from which it
arose\], a resurrection \[or παλιγγενεσία\] of it might be seen; and
this is *not* seen: well \[we reply\], it is not seen by blockheads; but
it *is* seen by those who can discriminate. For example, when thread is
destroyed, it is changed into the shape of earth \[as when burned to
ashes\]; and the earth is changed into the shape of a cotton-tree; and
this \[successively\] changes into the shape of flower, fruit, and
thread \[spun again from the fruit of the cotton-plant\]. So is it with
all entities.

   <span id="pp_121c"></span>*c*. Pray \[some one may ask\], is \[this\]
*manifestation* \[that you speak of under [§ 120](#pp_120.md)\] something
real, or something not real? If it be something real \[and which,
therefore, never anywhere ceases to be\], then \[all\] effects \[during
this constant manifestation\] ought constantly to be *perceived*; and,
if it be *not* real, then there would be the absence of \[all\]
products, \[in the absence of all manifestation. Manifestation,
therefore, must be something *real*; and\] there must be \[in order to
give rise to it,\] another manifestation of it, and of this another;
\[seeing that a *manifestation* can be the result of nothing else than a
manifestation, <span id="page_143">p. 143</span> on the principle that
an effect consists of neither more nor less than its cause\]; and thus
we have a *regressus in infinitum*. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How manifestation may occur without being an entity.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_122"></span>*Aph*. 122.[\*](#pp_122.md) Because they seek
each other reciprocally,<span
id="page_143_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_143_note_3.md) as is the case with seed
and plant, \[manifestation may generate manifestation, from eternity to
eternity\].

   <span id="pp_122a"></span>*a*. Be it so, that there are thousands of
manifestations; still there is no fault; for there *is* no
starting-point; as is the case with seed and plant, \[which people may
suppose to have served, from eternity, as sources, one to another,
reciprocally\].

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

   <span id="pp_122b"></span>*b*. He states another argument:

 

|                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The objections to the theory of manifestation retorted.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_123"></span>*Aph*. 123.[\*](#pp_123.md) Or, \[at all
events, our theory of 'manifestation' is as\] blameless as \[your theory
of\] 'production.'

   <span id="pp_123a"></span>*a*. Pray \[let us ask\], is *production*
produced, or is it not? If it is produced, then of this \[production of
production\] there must be production; so that there is a *regressus in
infinitum*, \[such as you allege against *our* theory, under [§ 121.
*c*.](#pp_121c.md)\] If it be *not* produced, then, pray, is this because
it is *unreal*, or because it is eternal? If because it is unreal, then
production never is at all; so that it would never be perceived, \[as
you allege that it is\]. Again, if \[production is not something
produced,\] because it is *eternal*, then there would be at, all times,
the production of \[all possible\] effects, \[which you will scarcely
pretend is the case\]. Again, if you say, since 'production' itself
*consists* of production, what need of supposing an ulterior production
\[of production\]? then, in like manner, \[*I* ask,\] since
'manifestation' itself *consists* of manifestation, what need of
supposing an ulterior manifestation \[of manifestation\]? The view which
you hold on this point is *ours*, also; \[and <span id="page_145">p.
145</span> thus every objection stated or hinted under [§ 121.
*c*.](#pp_121c.md), is capable of being retorted\].

   <span id="pp_123b"></span>*b*. He \[now\] states the community of
properties \[that exists\] among the products of Nature, mutually:

 

|                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The characters common to all products.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_124"></span>*Aph*. 124.[\*](#pp_124.md) \[A product of
Nature is\] caused, uneternal, not all-pervading, mutable,
multitudinous, dependent, mergent.

   <span id="pp_124a"></span>*a*. 'Caused,' i.e. having a cause.
'Uneternal,' i.e., destructible. 'Not all-pervading,' i.e., not present
everywhere. 'Mutable,' i.e., distinguished by the acts of leaving \[one
form\], and assuming \[another form\], &c. It \[the soul,\] leaves the
body it has assumed, \[and, probably, takes another\]; and bodies, &c.,
move \[and are mutable, as is notorious\]. 'Multitudinous,' i.e., in
consequence of the distinction of souls; \[every man, e.g., having a
separate body\]. 'Dependent,' \[i.e.,\] on its cause. 'Mergent,' that is
to say, it \[i.e., every product, in due time,\] is resolved into that
from which it originated.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

   <span id="pp_124b"></span>*b*. \[But, some one may say\], if
realities be the twenty-five \[which the Sánkhyas enumerate (see [§
61](#pp_61).md), and no more\], pray, are such common operations as
knowing, enjoying, &c., absolutely *nothing*; you accordingly giving up
what you *see*, \[in order to save an hypothesis with which what you see
is irreconcilable\]? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The qualities of the Nyáya are implied in the term Nature.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_125"></span>*Aph*. 125.[\*](#pp_125.md) There is the
establishment of these \[twenty-four 'Qualities' of the *Nyáya*, which
you fancy that we do not recognize, because we do not explicitly
enumerate them\], either by reason that these ordinary qualities \[as
contradistinguished from the *three* Qualities of the Sánkhya\], &c.,
are, in reality, nothing different; or \[to put it in another point of
view,\] because they are hinted by \[the term\] Nature, \[in which, like
our own three Qualities, they are implied\].

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

   <span id="pp_125a"></span>*a*. Either from their being nothing
different from the twenty-four principles, 'in reality,' truly, quite
evidently,—since the character of these \[twenty-four\] fits the
ordinary qualities, &c., \[which you fancy are neglected in our
enumeration of things,\]—' there is the establishment of these,' i.e.,
there is their establishment \[as realities,\] through their being
implied just in those \[twenty-four principles which are explicitly
specified in the Sánkhya\].

   <span id="pp_125b"></span>*b*. The word 'or' shows that there is
another alternative \[reply, in the aphorism, to the objection in
question\]. 'Or because they are hinted by \[the term\] Nature;' that is
to say, the qualities, &c. \[such as Knowledge\], are established \[as
realities\], just because they are hinted by \[the term\] Nature, by
reason that \[these\] qualities are, mediately, products of Nature; for
there is no difference between product and cause. But the omission to
mention them \[explicitly\] is not by reason of their not being at all.

   <span id="pp_125c"></span>*c*. He \[next\] mentions the points in
which Nature and \[her\] products agree:

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

 

|                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The characters common to Nature and her products.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_126"></span>*Aph*. 126.[\*](#pp_126.md) Of both \[Nature
and her products\] the fact that they consist of the three Qualities
\[[§ 61. *a*.](#pp_61a.md)\], and that they are irrational, &c., \[is the
common property\].

   <span id="pp_126a"></span>*a*. Consisting of the three qualities, and
being irrational, \[such in the meaning of the compound term with which
the aphorism commences\]. By the expression '&c.' is meant \[their\]
being intended for *another*, \[see [§ 66](#pp_66.md)\]. 'Of both,' i.e.,
of the cause \[viz., Nature\], and of the effects \[viz., all natural
products\]. Such is the meaning:

   <span id="pp_126b"></span>*b*. He \[next\] states the mutual
differences of character among the three Qualities which \[see [§
61](#pp_61.md)\] are the \[constituent\] parts of Nature:

 

|                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   In what the three Qualities differ.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_127"></span>*Aph*. 127.[\*](#pp_127.md) The Qualities \[[§
62](#pp_62.md)\] differ in character mutually by pleasantness,
unpleasantness, lassitude, &c., \[in which forms, severally, the
Qualities present themselves\].

   <span id="pp_127a"></span>*a*. 'Pleasantness,' i.e., Pleasure. By the
expression <span id="page_149">p. 149</span> '&c.' is meant Goodness
(*sattwa*), which is light \[i.e., not heavy,\] and illuminating.
'Unpleasantness,' i.e., Pain. By the expression '&c.' \[in reference to
this,\] is meant Passion (*rajas*), which is urgent and restless.
'Lassitude,' i.e., stupefaction. By the expression '&c.' is meant
Darkness (*tamas*), which is heavy and enveloping. It is by these habits
that the Qualities, viz., Goodness, Passion, and Darkness, differ: such
is the remainder, \[required to complete the aphorism\].

   <span id="pp_127b"></span>*b*. At the time of telling their
differences, he tells in what respects they agree:

 

|                                                                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   In what respects the Qualities agree, as well as differ.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_128"></span>*Aph*. 128.[\*](#pp_128.md) Through Lightness
and other habits the Qualities mutually agree and differ.

   <span id="pp_128a"></span>*a*. The meaning is as follows: the
enunciation \[in the <span id="page_150">p. 150</span> shape of the term
*laghu*, 'light,' is not one intended to call attention to the concrete,
viz., what things are light, but\] is one where the abstract \[the
nature of light things, viz., 'lightness' (*laghutwa*)\] is the
prominent thing. 'Through Lightness and other habits,' i.e., through the
characters of Lightness, Restlessness, and Heaviness, the Qualities
differ. Their *agreement* is through what is hinted by the expression
'and other.' And this consists in their mutually predominating \[one
over another, from time to time\], producing one another, consorting
together, and being reciprocally present, \[one in another\], for the
sake of Soul.

   <span id="pp_128b"></span>*b*. By \[the expressions, in [§
124](#pp_124.md),\] 'caused,' &c., it is declared that the 'Great one' \[or
Mind\], &c., are *products*. He states the proof of this:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Proof that Mind &c. are products.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_129"></span>*Aph*. 129.[\*](#pp_129.md) Since they are
other than both \[Soul and Nature, the only two uncaused entities\],
Mind and the rest are products; as is the case with a jar, or the like.

   <span id="pp_129a"></span>*a*. That is to say: like a jar, or the
like, Mind and the <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> rest are products;
because they are something other than the two which \[alone\] are
eternal, viz., Nature and Soul.

   <span id="pp_129b"></span>*b*. He states another reason:

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A second proof.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_130"></span>*Aph*. 130.[\*](#pp_130.md) Because of
\[their\] measure, \[which is a limited one\].

   <span id="pp_130a"></span>*a*. That is to say: \[Mind and the rest
are products\]; because they are limited in measure; \[whereas the only
two that are uncaused, viz., Nature and Soul, are unlimited\].

   <span id="pp_130b"></span>*b*. He states another argument:

 

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A third proof.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_131"></span>*Aph*. 131.[\*](#pp_131.md) Because they
conform \[to Nature\].

   <span id="pp_131a"></span>*a*. \[Mind and the rest are products\];
because they well \[follow and\] correspond with Nature; i.e., because
the Qualities of Nature \[[§ 61](#pp_61.md)\] are seen in all things: \[and
it <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> is a maxim, that what is in the
effect was derived from the cause and implies the cause\].

   <span id="pp_131b"></span>*b*. He states the same thing, \[in the
next aphorism\]:

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A fourth proof.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_132"></span>*Aph*. 132.[\*](#pp_132.md) And, finally,
because it is through the power \[of the cause alone, that the product
can do aught\].

   <span id="pp_132a"></span>*a*. It is by the power of its cause, that
a product energizes, \[as a chain restrains an elephant, only by the
force of the iron which it is made of\]; so that Mind and the rest,
being \[except through the strength of Nature,\] powerless, produce
*their* products in subservience to Nature. Otherwise, since it is their
habit to energize, they would at all times produce their products,
\[which it will not be alleged that they do\].

   <span id="pp_132b"></span>*b*. And the word *iti*, in this place, is
intended to notify the completion of the set of \[positive\] reasons
\[why Mind and the others should be regarded as products\].

   <span id="pp_132c"></span>*c*. He \[next\] states \[in support of the
same assertion,\] the argument from negatives, \[i.e., the argument
drawn <span id="page_153">p. 153</span> from the consideration as to
what becomes of Mind and the others, when they are *not* products\]:

 

|                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Converse proof of the same.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_133"></span>*Aph*. 133.[\*](#pp_133.md) On the quitting
thereof \[quitting the condition of product\], there is Nature, or Soul,
\[into one or other of which the product must needs have resolved
itself\].

   <span id="pp_133a"></span>*a*. Product and non-product; such is the
pair or alternatives. 'On the quitting thereof;' i.e., when Mind and the
rest quit the condition of product, Mind and the rest \[of necessity\]
enter into Nature, or Soul; \[these two alone being non-products\].

   <span id="pp_133b"></span>*b*. \[But perhaps some one may say, that\]
Mind and the rest may exist quite independently of the pair of
alternatives \[just mentioned\]. In regard to this, he declares \[as

   <span id="pp_134"></span>*Aph*. 134.[\*](#pp_134.md) If they were other
than these two they would be void; \[seeing that there is nothing
self-existent, besides soul and Nature\].

   <span id="pp_134a"></span>*a*. If Mind and the rest were 'other than
these two,' i.e., than product or non-product \[[§ 133](#pp_133.md)\], they
would be in the shape of what is 'void,' i.e., in the shape of
nonentity.

   <span id="pp_134b"></span>*b*. Well now, \[some one may say,\] why
should it be under the character of a *product*, that Mind and the rest
are a sign of \[there being such a principle as\] Nature? They may be
\[more properly said to be\] a sign, merely in virtue of their not
*occurring apart* from it. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What kind of causes can be inferred from their effects.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_135"></span>*Aph*. 135.[\*](#pp_135.md) The cause is
inferred from the effect, \[in the case of Nature and her products\];
because it accompanies it.

   <span id="pp_135a"></span>*a*. That \[other relation, other than that
of material and product, which you would make out to exist between
Nature and Mind,\] exists, indeed, where the nature \[or <span
id="page_155">p. 155</span> essence\] of the cause is not seen in the
effect; as \[is the case with\] the inference, from the rising of the
moon, that the sea is swollen \[into full tide; rising, with maternal
affection, towards her son who was produced from her bosom on the
occasion of the celebrated Churning of the Ocean. Though the swelling of
the tide does not occur apart from the rising of the moon, yet here the
cause, moon-rise, is not seen in the effect, tide; and, consequently,
though we infer the effect from the cause, the cause could not have been
inferred from the effect\]. But, in the present case, since we see, in
Mind and the rest, the characters of Nature, the cause *is* inferred
from the effect. 'Because it accompanies it,' i.e., because, in Mind and
the rest, we see the properties of Nature, \[i.e., Nature herself
actually present; as we see the clay which is the cause of a jar,
actually present in the jar\].

   <span id="pp_135b"></span>*b*. \[But it may still be objected,\] if
it be thus, then let that principle itself, the 'Great one' \[or Mind\],
be the cause of the world: what need of *Nature*? To this he replies:

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How Mind must have an antecedent.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_136"></span>*Aph*. 136.[\*](#pp_136.md) The indiscrete,
\[Nature, must be inferred\] from its \[discrete and resolvable\]
effect. \[Mind\], in which are the three Qualities, \[which constitute
Nature\].

   <span id="pp_136a"></span>*a*. 'It is resolved;' such is the import
of \[the term\] *linga*, \[here rendered\] 'effect.' From that
\[resolvable effect\], viz., the 'Great principle' \[or Mind\], in which
are the three Qualities, Nature must be inferred. And that the 'Great
principle,' in the shape of ascertainment \[or distinct intellection\],
is discrete \[or limited\] and perishable, is established by direct
observation. Therefore \[i.e., since Mind, being perishable, must be
resolvable into something else,\] we infer that into which it is
resolvable, \[in other words, its 'cause,' here analogously termed
*lingin*, since 'effect' has been termed *linga*\].

   <span id="pp_136b"></span>*b*. But then, \[some one may say\], still
something quite different may be the cause \[of all things\]: what need
of \[this\] *Nature* \[of yours\]? In regard to this, he remarks \[as
follows\]:

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

 

|                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Why Nature, and nothing else, must be the root of all.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_137"></span>*Aph*. 137.[\*](#pp_137.md) There is no denying
that it \[Nature,\] *is*; because of its effects, \[which will be in
vain attributed to any other source\].

   <span id="pp_137a"></span>*a*. Is the cause of this \[world\] a
product, or not a product? If it were a product, then, the same being
\[with equal propriety to be assumed to be\] the case with *its* cause,
there would be a *regressus in infinitum*. If effects be from any *root*
\[to which there is nothing antecedent\], then *this* is that \[to which
we give the name of *Nature*\]. 'Because of its effects,' that is to
say, because of the effects of Nature. There is no denying 'that it is,'
i.e., that *Nature* is.

   <span id="pp_137b"></span>*b*. Be it so, \[let us grant,\] that
Nature *is*; yet \[the opponent may contend,\] *Soul* positively cannot
be; for \[if the existence of causes is to be inferred from their
products, Soul cannot be thus demonstrated to exist, seeing that\] it
has *no* products. In regard to this, he remarks \[as follows\]:

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

 

|                                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   It is not from any effect that Soul is inferred.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_138"></span>*Aph*. 138.[\*](#pp_138.md) \[The relation of
cause and effect is\] not \[alleged as\] the means of establishing \[the
existence of Soul\]; because, as is the case with \[the disputed term\]
'merit,' there is no dispute about there being such a kind of thing;
\[though *what* kind of thing *is* matter of dispute\].

   <span id="pp_138a"></span>*a*. There is no dispute about 'there being
such a kind of thing,' i.e., as to there being Soul, simply; \[since
everybody who does not talk stark nonsense must admit a Soul, or *self*,
of *some* kind\]; for the dispute is \[not as to its *being*, but\] as
to its peculiarity \[of being\], as \[whether it be\] multitudinous, or
sole, all-pervading, or *not* all-pervading, and so forth; just as, in
every \[philosophical system, or\] theory, there is no dispute as to
\[there being something to which may be applied the term\] 'merit'
(*dharma*); for the difference of opinion has regard to the particular
kind of \[thing,—such as sacrifices, according to the Mímáṅsá creed, or
good works, according to the Nyáya,—which shall be held to involve\]
'merit.'

   <span id="pp_138b"></span>*b*. 'Not the means of establishing' that
\[viz., the existence of soul\]; i.e., the relation of cause and effect
is not the means of establishing it. This intends, 'I will mention
*another* means of establishing it.'

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

   <span id="pp_138c"></span>*c*. \[But some one may say,\] Souls are
nothing else than the body, and its organs, &c.: what need of imagining
anything else? To this he replies:

|------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Materialism scouted.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_139"></span>*Aph*. 139.[\*](#pp_139.md) Soul is something
else than the body, &c.

   <span id="pp_139a"></span>*a*. \[The meaning of the aphorism is\]
plain.

   <span id="pp_139b"></span>*b*. He propounds an argument in support of
this:

 

|                                                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The discerptible is subservient to the indiscerptible.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_140"></span>*Aph*. 140.[\*](#pp_140.md) Because that which
is combined \[and is, therefore, discerptible,\] is for the sake of some
other, \[*not* discerptible\].

   <span id="pp_140a"></span>*a*. That which is discerptible is intended
for something else that is indiscerptible. If it were intended for
something else that is discerptible, there would be a *regressus ad
infinitum*.

   <span id="pp_140b"></span>*b*. And combinedness \[involving (see [§
67](#pp_67).md) discerptibleness,\] <span id="page_160">p. 160</span>
consists in the Qualities' making some product by their state of mutual
commixture; or \[to express it otherwise,\] combinedness is the state of
the soft and the hard, \[which distinguishes matter from spirit\]. And
this exists occultly in Nature, as well as the rest; because, otherwise,
discerptibleness would not prove discoverable in the products thereof,
viz., the 'Great one,' &c.

   <span id="pp_140c"></span>*c*. He elucidates this same point:

 

|                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul presents no indication of being material.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_141"></span>*Aph*. 141.[\*](#pp_141.md) \[And Soul is
something else than the body, &c.\]; because there is \[in Soul,\] the
reverse of the three Qualities, &c.

   <span id="pp_141a"></span>*a*. Because there is, in Soul, 'the
reverse of the three Qualities,' &c., i.e., because they are not seen
\[in it\]. By the expression '&c.' is meant, because the *other*
characters of Nature, also, are not seen \[in soul\].

   <span id="pp_141b"></span>*b*. He states another argument:

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

 

|                                                                          |

| <span class="small">*   Another proof that Soul is not material.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_142"></span>*Aph*. 142.[\*](#pp_142.md) And \[Soul is not
material;\] because of \[its\] superintedence \[over Nature\].

   <span id="pp_142a"></span>*a*. For a superintendent is an intelligent
being; and Nature is unintelligent: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_142b"></span>*b*. He states another argument:

 

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another proof.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_143"></span>*Aph*. 143.[\*](#pp_143.md) \[And Soul is not
material;\] because of \[its\] being the experiencer.

   <span id="pp_143a"></span>*a*. It is Nature that is experienced; the
experiencer is Soul. Although Soul, from its being unchangeably the
same, is not \[really\] an experiencer, still the assertion \[in the
aphorism,\] is made, because of the fact that the reflexion of the
Intellect befalls it, \[and thus makes it *seem* as if it experienced
(see [§ 58. *a*.](#pp_58a).md)\].

   <span id="pp_143b"></span>*b*. Efforts are engaged in for the sake of
Liberation. Pray, is this \[for the benefit\] of the Soul, or of Nature;
<span id="page_162">p. 162</span> \[since Nature, in the shape of Mind,
is, it seems, the experiencer\]? To this be replies:

 

|                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   For Soul, not Nature, is Liberation wanted.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_144"></span>*Aph*. 144.[\*](#pp_144.md) \[It is for Soul,
and not for Nature;\] because<span
id="page_162_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_162_note_2.md) the exertions are with a
view to isolation \[from all qualities; a condition to which Soul is
competent, but Nature is not\].

   <span id="pp_144a"></span>*a*. The very essence of Nature cannot
depart from it \[so as to leave it in the state of absolute, solitary
isolation contemplated\]; because the three Qualities are its very
essence, \[the departure of which from it would leave nothing behind\],
and because it would thus prove to be *not* eternal, \[whereas, in
reality, it *is* eternal\]. The isolation (*kaivalya*) of that alone is
possible of which the qualities are reflexional, \[and not constitutive
(see [§ 58. *a*.](#pp_58a).md)\]; and that is Soul.

   <span id="pp_144b"></span>*b*. Of what nature is this \[Soul\]? To
this he replies:

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

 

|                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The nature of the Soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_145"></span>*Aph*. 145.[\*](#pp_145.md) Since light does
not pertain to the unintelligent, light, \[which must pertain to
something or other, is the essence of the Soul, which, self-manifesting,
manifests whatever else is manifest\].

   <span id="pp_145a"></span>*a*. It is a settled point, that the
unintelligent is not light; \[it is not self-manifesting\]. If Soul,
also, were unintelligent \[as the Naiyáyikas hold it to be, in
*substance*; knowledge being, by them, regarded not as its essence or
substratum, but as one of its *qualities*\], then there would need to be
another light for *it*; and, as the simple theory, let Soul itself
consist, essentially, of light.

   <span id="pp_145b"></span>*b*. And there is Scripture \[in support of
this view; for example, the two following texts from the *Bṛihadáraṉyaka
Upanishad*<span id="page_163_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_163_note_2.md)\]:
'Wherewith shall one distinguish that wherewith one distinguishes all
this \[world\]?' 'Wherewith shall one take cognizance of the cognizer?'

   <span id="pp_145c"></span>*c*. \[But the Naiyáyika may urge,\] *let*
Soul be unintelligent \[in its substance\], but have Intelligence as its
<span id="page_164">p. 164</span> attribute. *Thereby* it manifests all
things; but it is not, essentially, Intelligence. To this he replies:

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul has no quality*</span> |

   <span id="pp_146"></span>*Aph*. 146.[\*](#pp_146.md) It \[Soul,\] has
not Intelligence as its attribute; because it is without quality.

   <span id="pp_146a"></span>*a*. If soul were associated with
attributes, it would be \[as we hold everything to be, that is
associated with attributes,\] liable to alteration; and, therefore,
there would be no Liberation; \[its attributes, or susceptibilities,
always keeping it liable to be affected by something or other; or, the
absolutely simple being the only unalterable\].

   <span id="pp_146b"></span>*b*. He declares that there is a
contradiction to Scripture in this, \[i.e., in the view which he is
contending against\]:

 

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Scripture is higher evidence than supposed intuition.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_147"></span>*Aph*. 147.[\*](#pp_147.md) There is no denial
\[to be allowed\] of what is established by Scripture; because the
\[supposed\] evidence of intuition for this \[i.e., for the existence or
qualities in the Soul,\] is confuted \[by the Scriptural declaration of
the contrary\].

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

   <span id="pp_147a"></span>*a*. The text, 'For this Soul is
uncompanioned,'<span id="page_165_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_165_note_1.md)
&c., would be confuted, if there were any annexation of qualities \[to
Soul: and the notion of confuting Scripture is not to be entertained for
a moment\].

   <span id="pp_147b"></span>*b*. But the literal meaning \[of the
aphorism\] is this, that the fact, established by Scripture, of its
\[i.e., soul's,\] being devoid of qualities, &c., cannot be denied;
because the Scripture itself confutes the \[supposed\] intuitive
perception thereof, i.e., the \[supposed\] intuitive perception of
qualities, &c., \[in the soul\].

| <span class="small">*   Argument against the soul's being unintelligent.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_148"></span>*Aph*. 148.[\*](#pp_148.md) \[If soul were

profound \[and dreamless\] sleep, &c.

   <span id="pp_148a"></span>*a*. If soul were unintelligent, then, in
deep sleep, &c., it would not be a witness, a knower. But that this is
not <span id="page_166">p. 166</span> the case \[may be inferred\] from
the phenomenon, that 'I slept *pleasanty*.' By the expression '&c.' \[in
the aphorism,\] dreaming is included.

   <span id="pp_148b"></span>*b*. The Vedántís say that 'soul is *one*
only'; and so, again, 'For Soul is eternal, omnipresent, changeless,
void of blemish:' 'Being one \[only\], it is divided \[into a seeming
multitude\] by Nature (*śakti*), i.e., Illusion (*máyá*), but not
through its own essence, \[to which there does not belong
multiplicity\].' In regard to this, he says \[as follows\]:

 

|                                                                   |

| <span class="small">*   There is a multiplicity of souls.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_149"></span>*Aph*. 149.[\*](#pp_149.md) From the several
allotment of birth, &c., a multiplicity of souls \[is to be inferred\].

   <span id="pp_149a"></span>*a*. 'Birth, &c.' By the '&c.,' growth,
death, &c., are included. 'From the several allotment' of these, i.e.,
from their being appointed; \[birth to one, death to another, and so
on\]. 'A multiplicity of souls;' that is to say, souls <span
id="page_167">p. 167</span> are many. If soul were one only, then, when
*one* is born, *all* must be born, &c.

   <span id="pp_149b"></span>*b*. He ponders, as a doubt, the opinion of
the others, \[viz., of the Vedántís\]:

 

|                                                                        |

| <span class="small">*   The view of the Vedánta on this point.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_150"></span>*Aph*. 150.[\*](#pp_150.md) \[The Vedántís say,
that,\] there being a difference in its investments, moreover,
multiplicity attaches \[seemingly,\] to the one \[Soul\]; as is the case
with Space, by reason of jars, &c., \[which mark out the spaces that
they occupy\].

   <span id="pp_150a"></span>*a*. As Space is one,—\[and yet\], in
consequence of the difference of adjuncts, \[as\] jars, &c., when a jar
is destroyed, it is \[familiarly\] said, 'the jar's space is destroyed'
\[for then there no longer exists a *space marked out by the
jar*\];<span id="page_167_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_167_note_3.md)—so, also,
on the hypothesis of there being but one Soul, since there is a
difference of corporeal limitation, on the destruction thereof, \[i.e.,
of the limitation occasioned by any particular human body\], it is
merely a way of talking \[to say\], 'The soul has perished.' \[This,
indeed, is so far true, that there is really no perishing of Soul; but
<span id="page_168">p. 168</span> then it is true,\] also on the
hypothesis that there are *many* souls. \[And it must be true:\]
otherwise, since Soul is eternal, \[without beginning or end, as both
parties agree\], how could there be the appointment of birth and death?

   <span id="pp_150b"></span>*b*. He states \[what may serve for\] the
removal of doubt \[as to the point in question\]:

 

|                                                                          |

| <span class="small">*   Refutation of the Vedánta on this point.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_151"></span>*Aph*. 151.[\*](#pp_151.md) The investment is
different, \[according to the Vedántís\], but not that to which this
belongs; \[and the absurd consequences of such an opinion will be
seen\].

   <span id="pp_151a"></span>*a*. 'The investment is different,' \[there
are diverse bodies of John, Thomas, &c.\]; 'that to which this belongs,'
i.e. that \[Soul\] to which this investment \[of body, in all its
multiplicity,\] belongs, is *not* different, \[but is one only\]: such
is the meaning. And, \[now consider\], in consequence of the destruction
of one thing, we are not to speak as if there were the destruction of
something else; because this \[if it were evidence of a thing's being
destroyed,\] would present itself where it ought not;<span
id="page_168_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_168_note_3.md) \[the destruction of

a fact, when we are considering the case of Yajnadatta, who is not, for
*that* reason, to be assumed to be dead\]: and, on the hypothesis that
Soul is one, the \[fact that the Vedánta makes an\] imputation of in
consistent conditions is quite evident; since Bondage and Liberation do
not \[and cannot,\] belong \[simultaneously\] to *one*. But the
conjunction and \[simultaneous\] non-conjunction of the sky \[or space\]
with smoke, &c., \[of which the Vedántí may seek to avail himself, as an
illustration,\] are *not* contradictory; for Conjunction is not
pervasion; \[whereas, on the other hand, it would be nonsense to speak
of Bondage as affecting one portion of a monad, and Liberation as
affecting another portion; as a monkey may be in conjunction with a
branch of a tree, without being in conjunction with the stem\].

   <span id="pp_151b"></span>*b*. What may be \[proved\] by this? To
this he replies:

conditions to \[a Soul <span id="page_170">p. 170</span> supposed to
be\] everywhere present as *one* \[infinitely extended monad\].

   <span id="pp_152a"></span>*a*. 'Thus,' i.e., \[if you regard the
matter rightly,\] according to the manner here set forth, there is no
'imputation,' or attribution, 'of incompatible conditions,' Bondage,
Liberation, &c., to a soul 'existing everywhere,' throughout all, as
one, \[i.e., as a monad\].

   <span id="pp_152b"></span>*b*. \[But, the Vedántí may contend,\] we
*see* the condition of another attributed even to one quite different;
as, e.g., Nature's character as an agent \[is attributed\] to Soul,
which is another \[than Nature\]. To this he replies:

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Imputation is not proof.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_153"></span>*Aph*. 153.[\*](#pp_153.md) Even though there
be \[imputed to Soul\] the possession of the condition of another, this
\[i.e., that it really possesses such,\] is not established by the
imputation; because it \[Soul,\] is *one* \[absolutely simple,
unqualified entity\].

   <span id="pp_153a"></span>*a*. \[The notion\] that Soul is an agent
is a mistake; because, that Soul is *not* an agent is true, and the
imputation \[of agency to Soul\] is *not* true, and the combination of
the true and the untrue is not real. Neither birth nor <span
id="page_171">p. 171</span> death or the like is compatible with Soul;
because it is uncompanioned, \[i.e., unattended either by qualities or
by actions\].

   <span id="pp_153b"></span>*b*. \[But the Vedántí may say:\] and thus
there will be an opposition to the Scripture. For, according to that,
'Brahma is one without a second:'<span
id="page_171_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_171_note_2.md) 'There is nothing here
diverse; death after death does he \[deluded man,\] obtain, who here
sees, as it were, a multiplicity.'<span
id="page_171_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_171_note_3.md) To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Scripture, speaking of Soul as one, is speaking of it generically.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_154"></span>*Aph*. 154.[\*](#pp_154.md) There is no
opposition to the Scriptures \[declaratory\] of the non-duality \[of
Soul\]; because the reference \[in such texts,\] is to the *genus*, \[or
to Soul in general\].

   <span id="pp_154a"></span>*a*. But there is no opposition \[in our
Sánkhya view of the matter,\] to the Scriptures \[which speak\] of the
Oneness of Soul; because those \[Scriptural texts\] refer to the
*genus*. <span id="page_172">p. 172</span> By *genus* we mean sameness,
the fact of being of the same nature: and it is to this alone that the
texts about the non-duality \[of Soul\] have reference. It is not the
indivisibleness \[of Soul,—meaning, by its indivisibleness, the
impossibility that there should be more souls than one,—that is meant in
such texts\]; because there is no motive \[for viewing Soul as *thus*
indivisible\]: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_154b"></span>*b*. But then, \[the Vedántí may rejoin,\]
Bondage and Liberation are just as incompatible in any single soul, on
the theory of him who asserts that souls are many, \[and that each is at
once bound and free\]. To this he replies:

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

 

|                                                                           |

| <span class="small">*   The compatibility of Bondage and Freedom.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_155"></span>*Aph*. 155.[\*](#pp_155.md) Of him \[i.e., of
that soul,\] by whom the cause of Bondage is known, there is that
condition \[of isolation, or entire liberation\], by the perception \[of
the fact, that Nature and soul are distinct, and that he, really, was
*not* bound, even when he seemed to be so\].<span
id="page_172_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_172_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_155a"></span>*a*. By whom is known 'the cause of
bondage,' viz., the non-perception that Nature and soul are distinct, of
him, 'by the perception' \[of it\], i.e., by cognizing the distinction,
there is 'that condition,' viz., the condition of isolation, \[the
condition (see [§ 144](#pp_144).md) after which the soul aspires. The soul
in Bondage which is no real bondage may be typified by Don Quixote,
hanging, in the dark, from the ledge of a supposed enormous precipice,
and holding on for life, as he thought, from not knowing that his toes
were within six inches of the ground\].

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

   <span id="pp_155b"></span>*b*. \[Well, rejoins the Vedántí,\] Bondage
\[as you justly observe,\] is dependent on non-perception \[of the
truth\], and is not real. It is a maxim, that non-perception is removed
by perception; and, on this showing, we recognize as correct the theory
that soul is one, but not that of soul's being multitudinous. To this he
replies:

 

|                                                         |

   <span id="pp_156a"></span>*a*. What! because a blind man does not
see, does also one who has his eyesight not perceive? There are *many*
arguments \[in support of the view\] of those who assert that souls are
many, \[though *you* do not see them\]: such is the meaning.'

   <span id="pp_156b"></span>*b*. He declares, for the following reason,
also, that souls are many:

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

 

|                                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Scripture proof that Souls are many.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_157"></span>*Aph*. 157.[\*](#pp_157.md) Vámadeva, as well
as others, has been liberated, \[if we are to believe the Scriptures;
therefore\] non-duality is not \[asserted, in the same Scriptures, in
the Vedántic sense\].

   <span id="pp_157a"></span>*a*. In the Puráṉas, &c., we hear, Vámadeva
has been liberated,' 'Śuka has been liberated,' and so on. If Soul were
*one*, since the liberation of all would take place, on the liberation
of one, the Scriptural mention of a diversity \[of separate and
successive liberations\] would be self-contradictory.

   <span id="pp_157b"></span>*b*. \[But the Vedántí may rejoin:\] on the
theory that Souls are many, since the world has been from eternity, and
from time to time some one or other is liberated, so, by degrees, *all*
having been liberated, there would be a universal void. But, on the
theory that Soul is *one*, Liberation is merely the departure of an
adjunct, \[which, the Vedántí flatters himself, does not involve the
inconsistency which he objects to the Sánkhya\], To this he replies:

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   As it has been, so will it be.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_158"></span>*Aph*. 158.[\*](#pp_158.md) Though it \[the
world,\] has been from eternity, since, up to this day, there has not
been \[an entire emptying of the world\], the future, also, \[may be
inferentially expected to be\] thus \[as it has been heretofore\].

   <span id="pp_158a"></span>*a*. Though the world *has been* from
eternity, since, up to this day, we have not seen it become a void,
there is no proof \[in support\] of the view that there will be
Liberation \[of *all* Souls, so as to leave a void\].

   <span id="pp_158b"></span>*b*. He states another solution \[of the
difficulty\]:

 

|                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The stream of mundane things will flow on for ever.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_159"></span>*Aph*. 159.[\*](#pp_159.md) As now \[things
are, so\], everywhere \[will they continue to go on: hence there will
be\] no absolute cutting short \[of the course of mundane things\].

   <span id="pp_159a"></span>*a*. Since souls are \[in number,\] without
end, though Liberation successively take place, there will not be \[as a
necessary consequence,\] a cutting short of the world. As now, so
everywhere,—i.e., in time to come, also,—there <span id="page_177">p.
177</span> will be Liberation, but not, therefore, an absolute cutting
short \[of the world\]; since of this the on-flowing is eternal.

   <span id="pp_159b"></span>*b*. On the theory, also, that Liberation
is the departure of an adjunct \[[§ 157. *b*.](#pp_157b.md)\], we should
find a universal void; so that the doubt<span
id="page_177_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_177_note_2.md) is alike, \[in its
application to either view\]. Just as there might be an end of all
things, on the successive liberation of many souls, so, since all
adjuncts would cease, when \[the fruit of\] works \[this fruit being in
the shape of Soul's association with body, as its adjunct,\] came to an
end, the world would become void, \[on the Vedánta theory, as well as on
the Sánkhya\].

   <span id="pp_159c"></span>*c*. Now, \[if the Vedántí says,\] there
will not be a void, because adjuncts are \[in number,\] endless, then it
is the same, on the theory that Souls are many. And thus \[it has been
declared\]:<span id="page_177_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_177_note_4.md) 'For
this very reason, indeed, though those who are knowing \[in regard to
the fact that Nature <span id="page_178">p. 178</span> and Soul are
different\], are continually being liberated, there will not be a void,
inasmuch as there is no end of multitudes of souls in the universe.'

   <span id="pp_159d"></span>*d*. Pray, \[some one may ask,\] is Soul
\[*essentially*\] bound? Or free? If \[essentially\] bound, then, since
its essence cannot depart, there is no Liberation; for, if it \[the
essence,\] departed, then it \[Soul,\] would \[cease, with the cessation
of its essence, and\] not be eternal. If \[on the other hand, you reply
that it is essentially\] free, then meditation and the like \[which you
prescribe for the attainment of liberation,\] are unmeaning. To this he
replies:

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

 

|                                                                                                   |

   <span id="pp_160"></span>*Aph*. 160.[\*](#pp_160.md) It \[Soul,\] is
altogether free \[but seemingly\] multiform \[or different, in
appearance, from a free thing, through a delusive semblance of being
bound\].<span id="page_178_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_178_note_3.md)

   <span id="pp_160a"></span>*a*. It is not bound; nor is it liberated;
but it is ever free, \[see [§ 19](#pp_19.md)\]. But the destruction of
ignorance \[as to its actual freedom,\] is effected by meditation, &c.,
\[which are, therefore, not unmeaning, as alleged in [§ 159.
*d*.](#pp_159d.md)\].

   <span id="pp_160b"></span>*b*. It has been declared that Soul is a
witness.<span id="page_179_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_179_note_2.md) Since it
is a witness \[some one may object\], even when it has attained to
discriminating \[between Nature and Soul\], there <span id="page_180">p.
180</span> is no Liberation; \[Soul, on this showing, being not an
absolutely simple entity, but something *combined* with the character of
a spectator or witness\]. To this he replies:

Through its connexion therewith, it \[Soul,\] is a witness. And where is

Soul is, positively, always devoid of the Bondage called Pain \[see §§
[1](#pp_1) and [19](#pp_19.md)\]; because Pain and the rest are
modifcations of Understanding, \[which (see [§ 61](#pp_61).md) is a
modification of Nature, from which Soul is really distinct\].

fancy of being an agent, is 'from the proximity of Intellect,' 'through
the influence' of Nature, \[(see [§ 19](#pp_19),.md) of which Intellect
(see [§ 61](#pp_61).md) is a modification\].

   <span id="pp_164b"></span>*b*. The repetition of the expression 'from
the proximity of Intellect' is meant to show that we have reached the
conclusion: for thus do we see \[practised\] in the Scriptures, \[e.g.,

having, with the sentence of comment attached to them, no place here;
and Dr. Ballantyne, when he republished the Sánkhya Aphorisms in the
*Bibliotheca Indica*, omitted them. Hence the brackets now inserted, and
my alteration of the numbering of the Aphorisms throughout the remainder
of Book I. *Ed*.

\[\* Almost certainly, this interpolation was taken from the Serampore
edition of the *Sánkhya-pravachana-bháshya*. My copy of that work was
lent, in 1851, to Pandit Híránanda Chaube, who prepared, for Dr.
Ballantyne, the Sanskrit portion of what corrpesonds to pp. 1-183,
*supra*, in which additions, compressions, interpolations, and other
alterations lawlessly made by him, and scholia of his own devising, were
introduced with regrettable frequency.\]

see evidenced. The attitude which he assumed is that of suspense of
judgment on the point of theism, as against the positiveness of the
professed atheist. Vijnána, here followed, then goes on to say: 'For,
otherwise \[i.e., if the aphorist had been atheistic\], it would have
been explicitly declared, Because of the non-existence of a Lord.' *Ed*.

exposition of this Aphorism is as follows: <span
id="footnotes_page_116">p. 116</span> According to this, the term
*íśwara*, 'mighty one,' 'lord,' is applied, by way of eulogy, either to
a soul as it were liberated, or to a person who, through devotion, has
acquired transcendent faculties, that is to say, the *Yogí*. Resolution,
agentship, and the like, are impredicable of one absolutely liberated;
and such a one, being inert and impassive, cannot be intended by
*íśwara*, 'a power.' Hence the expression, 'as it were liberated.' Also
see, for *atiśaya*,—translated, above, 'transcendent faculties,'—[Book
IV., Aph. 24.](sak4.htm#pp_24.md) *Ed*.

as they often do, in their elucidations of the Aphorism. Nágeśa's
explanation of it is as follows: \#\#\# <span id="footnotes_page_173">p.
173</span> The substance of this is, that, only in the eyes of the
mistaken man who is influenced by the notorious cause of bondage, or in
other words, who is unable to discriminate, is the essential condition
of souls multeity, a condition the reverse of the one before referred
to, unity; and that is inconclusive. The Aphorism, thus undertood, must
be assumed to proceed from a Vedántic disputant against the Sánkhya.
Whether as read by Aniruddha, or as read by others, it is susceptible,
with reference to the previous context, of a variety of renderings.

According to most interpreters, however, the preceding Aphorism has
reference to the question whether it be only after Soul is <span

at all times, that simplicity, or unchanging fixedness, of essential
condition (*ekarúpatwa*) is predicable of it.
