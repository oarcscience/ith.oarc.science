## BOOK II.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

   <span id="pp_0a"></span>*a*. The subject-matter \[of the Institute\]
has been set forth \[in Book I.\]. Now, in order to prove that it is not
the *Soul* that undergoes the alterations \[observable in the course of
things\], he will tell, very diffusely, in the Second Book, how the
creation is formed out of the Primal Principle. There, too, the nature
of the products of Nature is to be declared fully, with a view to the
very clear discrimination of Soul from these. Therefore, according to
\[the verses\],<span id="page_184_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_184_note_1.md)

   <span id="pp_0b"></span>*b*. 'Whoso rightly knows its changes, and
the Primal Agent \[Nature\], and soul, the eternal, he, thirsting no
more, is emancipated,'

   <span id="pp_0c"></span>*c*. we remark, that, with reference to the
character, &c., of Emancipation, all the three \[things mentioned in
these verses\] require to be known. And here, in the first place, with
advertence to the consideration, that, if Nature, which is
unintelligent, were to create without a motive, we should find even the
emancipated one bound, he states the *motive* for the creation of the
world:

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The motive for creation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_1"></span>*Aph*. 1.[\*](#pp_1.md) Of Nature \[the agency,
or the being a maker, is\] for the emancipation of what is \[really,
though not apparently,\] emancipated, or else for \[the removal of\]
itself.

   <span id="pp_1a"></span>*a*. The expression 'the being a maker' is
borrowed from the last aphorism of the preceding Book. Nature makes the
world for the sake of removing the pain, which is \[really\] a shadow
\[[Book I., § 58](sak1.htm#pp_58.md)\], belonging to the Soul, which is, in
its very nature, free from the bonds of pain; or \[to explain it
otherwise,\] for the sake of removing pain \[connected\] by means of but
a shadowy link; or \[on the other hand,\] it is 'for the sake of
itself,' that is to say, for the sake of removing the actually real pain
\[which consists\] of itself.

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

   <span id="pp_1b"></span>*b*. Although experience \[of good and ill\],
also, as well as Emancipation, is a motive for creation, yet
Emancipation alone is mentioned, inasmuch as it is the principal one.

   <span id="pp_1c"></span>*c*. But then, if creation were for the sake
of Emancipation, then, since Emancipation might take place through
creation once for all, there would not be creation again and again; to
which he replies:<span id="page_186_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_186_note_3.md)

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Successive creation why.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_2"></span>*Aph*. 2.[\*](#pp_2.md) Because this
\[Emancipation\] is \[only\] of him that is void of passion.

   <span id="pp_2a"></span>*a*. Emancipation does not take place through
creation once for all; but it is \[the lot only\] of him that has been
extremely tormented many times by the various pain of birth, death,
sickness, &c.; and, therefore, \[successive creation goes on\] because
Emancipation actually occurs in the case only of him in whom complete
dispassion has <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> arisen through the
knowledge of the distinctness of Nature and Soul: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_2b"></span>*b*. He tells the reason why dispassion does
not take place through creation once for all:

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Force of the foregoing reason.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_3"></span>*Aph*. 3.[\*](#pp_3.md) It is not effected by the
mere hearing; because of the forcibleness of the impressions<span
id="page_187_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_187_note_4.md) from eternity.

   <span id="pp_3a"></span>*a*. Even the hearing \[of Scripture, in
which the distinctness of Nature from Soul is enounced,\] comes \[not to
all alike, but only\] through the merit of acts done in many births,
\[or successive lives\]. Even then dispassion is not established through
the mere hearing, but through direct cognition; and direct cognition
does not take place suddenly, because of the forcibleness of false
impressions that <span id="page_188">p. 188</span> have existed from
eternity, but \[the required direct cognition takes place\] through the
completion of Concentration; and there is an abundance of obstacles to
Concentration \[see Yoga Aphorisms, Book II\]: therefore, only after
many births do dispassion and Emancipation take place at any time of any
one at all: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_3b"></span>*b*. He states another reason for the
continuous flow of creation:

 

|                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another reason for continuous creation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_4"></span>*Aph*. 4.[\*](#pp_4.md) Or as people have,
severally, many dependants.

   <span id="pp_4a"></span>*a*. As householders have, severally, many
who are dependent upon them, according to the distinctions of wife,
children, &c., so, also, the Qualities, viz., Goodness, &c., \[[Book I.,
§ 61. *b*.](sak1.htm#pp_61b.md)\] have to emancipate innumerable Souls,
severally. Therefore, however many Souls may have been emancipated, the
onflow of creation takes place for the emancipation of other Souls; for
Souls are \[in number,\] without end: such is the meaning. And so the
Yoga aphorism \[Book II., § 22\] says: 'Though it have ceased <span
id="page_189">p. 189</span> to be, in respect of him that has done the
work, it has not \[absolutely\] ceased to be; because it is common to
others besides him.'

   <span id="pp_4b"></span>*b*. But then why is it asserted that Nature
alone creates, when, by the text, 'From that or this Soul proceeded the
Ether,'<span id="page_189_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_189_note_2.md) &c., it is
proved that *Soul*, also, creates? To this he replies:

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature, not Soul, creates.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_5"></span>*Aph*. 5.[\*](#pp_5.md) And, since it \[the
character of creator,\] belongs, really, to Nature, it follows that it
is fictitiously attributed to Soul.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

   <span id="pp_5a"></span>*a*. And, since Nature's character of creator
is decided to be real, there is, really, in the Scriptures, only a
fictitious \[or figurative\] attribution of creativeness to Soul.

   <span id="pp_5b"></span>*b*. But then, if it be thus, how is it laid
down that Nature's creativeness, moreover, is *real*; since we are told
\[in Scripture,\] that creation, moreover, is on a level with a dream?
To this he replies:

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The reality of Nature's creativeness.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_6"></span>*Aph*. 6.[\*](#pp_6.md) Since it is proved from
the products.

   <span id="pp_6a"></span>*a*. That is to say: because the real
creative character of Nature is established just 'from the products,'
viz., by that evidence \[see [Book I., § 110](sak1.htm#pp_110.md),\] which
acquaints us with the subject \[in which the creative character
inheres\]; for *products* are real, inasmuch as they produce impressions
and exhibit acts. \[The reality of eternal things is established here,
just as it is by Locke, who says: 'I think <span id="page_191">p.
191</span> God has given me assurance enough as to the existence of
things without me; since, by their different application, I can produce,
in myself, both *pleasure and pain* (*artha*), which is one great
concernment of my present state.' These existing products being
admitted, the Sánkhya argues that they must have a cause; and, as this
cause means neither more nor less than something creative, whatever
proves the existence of the cause proves, at the same time, its creative
character.\]

   <span id="pp_6b"></span>*b*. But then \[it may be said\], on the
alternative \[see [§ 1](#pp_1.md)\] that Nature works for *herself*, she
must energize with reference to the *emancipated* Soul, also. To this he
replies:

 

|                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Who escape nature.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_7"></span>*Aph*. 7.[\*](#pp_7.md) The rule is with
reference to one knowing; just as escape from a thorn.

   <span id="pp_7a"></span>*a*. The word *chetana* here means 'one
knowing;' because the derivation is from *chit*, 'to be conscious'. As
one and the same thorn is not a cause of pain to him who, being 'one
knowing,' i.e., aware of it, escapes from that same, but actually is so
in respect of *others*; so Nature, also, is escaped by 'one knowing,'
one aware, one who has accomplished the matter: to *him* it does not
consist of pain; but to others, who are *not* knowing, it actually is a
cause of pain: such is <span id="page_192">p. 192</span> the 'rule,'
meaning, the distribution. Hence, also, of Nature, which is, by its own
nature, bound \[inasmuch as it *consists* of bonds\], the
self-emancipation is possible; so that it does not energize with
reference to the emancipated Soul \[[§ 6. *b*.](#pp_6b.md)\].

   <span id="pp_7b"></span>*b*. But then \[suggests some one\], what was
said \[at [§ 5](#pp_5.md)\], that, in respect of Soul, the creative
character is only fictitiously attributed, this is not proper; because
it is fitting, that, by the conjunction of Nature, *Soul*, also, should
be modified into Mind, &c.; for a modification of wood, &c., resembling
earth, &c., through the conjunction of earth, &c., is seen: to which he
replies:

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

 

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul not creative, though associated with what is so.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_8"></span>*Aph*. 8.[\*](#pp_8.md) Even though there be
conjunction \[of Soul\] with the other \[viz., Nature\], this \[power of
giving rise to products\] does not exist in it immediately; just like
the burning action of iron.

   <span id="pp_8a"></span>*a*. Even though there be conjunction with
Nature, there belongs to Soul no creativeness, 'immediately,' i.e.,
directly. An illustration of this is, 'like the burning action of iron:'
as iron does not possess, directly, a burning Power; but this is only
fictitiously attributed to it, being through the fire conjoined with it:
such is the meaning. But, in the example just mentioned, it is admitted
that there is an alteration of both; for this is proved by
sense-evidence: but, in the instance under doubt, since the case is
accounted for by the modification of one only, there is cumbrousness in
postulating the modification of both; because, otherwise, by the
conjunction of the China-rose, it might be held that the colour of the
crystal was changed.

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

   <span id="pp_8b"></span>*b*. It has already been stated \[[§
1](#pp_1.md)\] that the fruit of creation is emancipation. Now he states
the principal occasional cause of creation:

 

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Creation when.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_9"></span>*Aph*. 9.[\*](#pp_9.md) When there is passion, or
dispassion, there is concentration, \[in the latter case, and\]
creation, \[in the former\].

   <span id="pp_9a"></span>*a*. When there is passion, there is
creation; and, when there is dispassion, there is 'concentration,' i.e.,
the abiding \[of Soul\] in its own nature \[see Yoga Aphorisms, Book I.,
§ 3<span id="page_194_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_194_note_2.md)\]; in short,
emancipation, or the hindering of the modifications of the thinking
principle \[Yoga Aphorisms, Book I., § 2<span
id="page_194_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_194_note_2.md)\]: such is the meaning.
And so the import is, that Passion is the cause of creation; because of
their being<span id="page_194_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_194_note_3.md)
simultaneously present or absent.

   <span id="pp_9b"></span>*b*. After this he begins to state the manner
of creation:

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

 

|                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Order of creation.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_10"></span>*Aph*. 10.[\*](#pp_10.md) In the order \[see [§
12. *b*.](#pp_12b.md)\] of Mind, &c., \[is the creation\] of the five
elements, \[or of the material world\].

   <span id="pp_10a"></span>*a*. 'Creation' is supplied from the
preceding aphorism.

   <span id="pp_10b"></span>*b*. He mentions a distinction \[between
these successively creative energies and the primal one\]:

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Nature's products not for themselves.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_11"></span>*Aph*. 11.[\*](#pp_11.md) Since creation is for
the sake of Soul the origination of these \[products of Nature\] is not
for their own sake.

   <span id="pp_11a"></span>*a*. 'Of these,' i.e., of Mind, &c., since
the creativeness is 'for the sake of Soul,' i.e., for the sake of the
emancipation of Soul, the 'origination,' i.e., the creativeness, is not
for the sake of themselves; since, inasmuch as they are perishable, they
\[unlike Nature, (see [§ 1](#pp_1).md)\] are not susceptible of
emancipation: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_11b"></span>*b*. He declares the creation of limited
space and time:

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

 

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Relative time and space whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_12"></span>*Aph*. 12.[\*](#pp_12.md) \[Relative\] Space and
Time \[arise\] from the Ether, &c.

   <span id="pp_12a"></span>*a*. The Space and Time which are *eternal*
\[and absolute\], being the *source* of the Ether, are, really, sorts of
qualities of Nature: therefore it is consistent that Space and Time
should be all-pervading. But the Space and Time which are limited arise
from the Ether, through the conjunction of this or that limiting object:
such is the meaning. By the expression '&c.,' \[in the aphorism,\] is
meant 'from the apprehending of this or that limiting object.'

   <span id="pp_12b"></span>*b*. Now he exhibits, in their order,
through their nature and their habits, the things mentioned \[in [§
10](#pp_10.md)\] as 'in the order of Mind, &c.':

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Mind or Intellect defined.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_13"></span>*Aph*. 13.[\*](#pp_13.md) Intellect is judgment.

   <span id="pp_13a"></span>*a*. 'Intellect' is a synonym of 'the Great
Principle' \[or Mind (see [Book I., § 71](sak1.htm#pp_71).md)\]; and
'judgment,' called \[also\] ascertainment, is its <span id="page_197">p.
197</span> peculiar modification: such is the meaning. But they are set
forth as identical, because a property and that of which it is the
property are indivisible.<span
id="page_197_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_197_note_1.md) And it is to be
understood, that this Intellect is 'Great,' because it pervades all
effects other than itself, and because it is of great power.

   <span id="pp_13b"></span>*b*. He mentions other properties, also, of
the Great Principle:

 

|                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Products of intellect.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_14"></span>*Aph*. 14.[\*](#pp_14.md) Merit, &c., are
products of it.

   <span id="pp_14a"></span>*a*. The meaning is, that Merit, Knowledge,
Dispassion, and Supernatural Power, moreover, are formed out of
*intellect*, not formed of *self-consciousness* (*ahankára*), &c.;
because intellect alone \[and not self-consciousness,\] is a product of
superlative Purity, \[without admixture of Passion and Darkness\].

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

   <span id="pp_14b"></span>*b*. But then, if it be thus, how can the
prevalence of demerit, in the portions of intellect lodged in men,
cattle, &c., be accounted for? To this he replies:

 

|                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Opposite products of intellect.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_15"></span>*Aph*. 15.[\*](#pp_15.md) The Great one
\[intellect,\] becomes reversed through tincture.<span
id="page_198_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_198_note_2.md)

   <span id="pp_15a"></span>*a*. That same 'Great one,' i.e., the Great
Principle \[or intellect\], through being tinged with Passion and
Darkness, also becomes 'reversed' \[see [§ 14. *a*.](#pp_14a.md)\], i.e.,
vile, with the properties of Demerit, Ignorance, Non-dispassion, and
want of Supernatural Power: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_15b"></span>*b*. Having characterized the Great
Principle, he defines its product, Self-consciousness:

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

 

|                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Self-consciousness.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_16"></span>*Aph*. 16.[\*](#pp_16.md) Self-consciousness is
a conceit.

   <span id="pp_16a"></span>*a*. 'Self-consciousness' is what makes the
Ego, as a potter \[makes a pot\]; the thing \[called\] the internal<span
id="page_199_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_199_note_*.md) instrument
(*antaẖ-karaṉa*): and this, inasmuch as a property and that of which it
is the property are indivisible, is spoken of as 'a conceit,'<span
id="page_199_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_199_note_1.md) \[viz., of
personality\], in order to acquaint us that this is its peculiar
modification. Only when a thing has been determined by intellect \[i.e.,
by an act of judgment (see [§ 13. *a*.](#pp_13a).md)\], do the making of an
Ego and the making of a Meum take place.

   <span id="pp_16b"></span>*b*. He mentions the product of
Self-consciousness, which has arrived in order:

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Product of Self-consciousness.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_17"></span>*Aph*. 17.[\*](#pp_17.md) The product of it
\[viz., of Self-consciousness,\] is the eleven \[organs\], and the five
Subtile Elements.

   <span id="pp_17a"></span>*a*. The meaning is, that the eleven organs,
with the <span id="page_200">p. 200</span> five Subtile Elements, viz.,
Sound, &c., are the product of Self-consciousness.

   <span id="pp_17b"></span>*b*. Among these, moreover, he mentions a
distinction:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Mind whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_18"></span>*Aph*. 18.[\*](#pp_18.md) The eleventh,
consisting of \[the principle of\] Purity, proceeds from modified
Self-consciousness.

   <span id="pp_18a"></span>*a*. The 'eleventh,' i.e., the completer of
the eleven, viz., Mind, \[or the 'internal organ,'—which is not to be
confounded with 'the Great one,' called also Intellect and
Mind,—alone,\] among the set consisting of sixteen \[[§ 17](#pp_17.md)\],
consists of Purity; therefore it is produced from Self-consciousness
'modified,' i.e., pure: such is the meaning. And hence, too, it is to be
reckoned that the ten organs are from the Passionate Self-consciousness;
and the Subtile Elements, from the Dark Self-consciousness.

   <span id="pp_18b"></span>*b*. He exhibits the eleven organs:

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

 

|                                                |
|------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Of the Organs.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_19"></span>*Aph*. 19.[\*](#pp_19.md) Along with the organs
of action and the organs of understanding another is the eleventh.

   <span id="pp_19a"></span>*a*. The organs of action are five, viz.,
the vocal organ, the hands, the feet, the anus, and the generative
organ; and, the organs of understanding are five, those called the
organs of sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Along with these ten,
'another,' viz., Mind, is 'the eleventh,' i.e., is the eleventh organ:
such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_19b"></span>*b*. He refutes the opinion that the Organs
are formed of the Elements:

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Nyáya view rejected.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_20"></span>*Aph*. 20.[\*](#pp_20.md) They \[the organs,\]
are not formed of the Elements; because there is Scripture for \[their\]
being formed of Self-consciousness.

   <span id="pp_20a"></span>*a*. Supply 'the organs.'

   <span id="pp_20b"></span>*b*. Pondering a doubt, he says:

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A text explained.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_21"></span>*Aph*. 21.[\*](#pp_21.md) The Scripture
regarding absorption into deities is not \[declaratory\] of an
originator.

   <span id="pp_21a"></span>*a*. That Scripture which there is about
absorption into deities is not 'of an originator,' that is to say, it
does not refer to an originator; because \[although a thing, e.g., a
jar, when it ceases to be a jar, is usually spoken of as being resolved
into its originator, viz., into earth, yet\] we see the absorption of a
drop of water into what, nevertheless, is *not* its originator, viz.,
the ground; \[and such is the absorption into a deity from whom the Mind
absorbed did not originally emanate\].

   <span id="pp_21b"></span>*b*. Some say that the Mind, included among
the organs, is eternal. He repels this:

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   No organ eternal.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_22"></span>*Aph*. 22.[\*](#pp_22.md) \[None of the organs
is eternal, as some hold the Mind to be;\] because we have Scripture for
their beginning to be, and because we see their destruction.

   <span id="pp_22a"></span>*a*. All these organs, without exception,
have a beginning; for the Scripture says, 'From this are produced the
vital air, the mind, and all the organs;'<span
id="page_203_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_203_note_2.md) &c., and because we are
certified of their destruction by the fact that, in the conditions of
being aged, &c., the mind, also, like the sight and the rest, decays,
&c.: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_22b"></span>*b*. He rebuts the atheistical opinion that
the sense \[for example,\] is merely the set of eye-balls, \[&c.\]:

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

 

|                                                                               |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Sense not to be confounded with its site.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_23"></span>*Aph*. 23.[\*](#pp_23.md) The Sense is
supersensuous; \[it being the notion\] of mistaken persons \[that the
Sense exists\] in \[identity with\] its site.

   <span id="pp_23a"></span>*a*. Every Sense is supersensuous, and not
perceptible; but only in the opinion of mistaken persons does the Sense
exist 'in its site,' e.g., \[Sight,\] in the eye-ball, in the condition
of identity \[with the eye-ball\]: such is the meaning. The correct
reading is: '\[The sense is something supersensuous; to confound it
with\] the site, \[is a mistake\].'

   <span id="pp_23b"></span>*b*. He rebuts the opinion that one single
Sense, through diversity of powers, performs various offices:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   All the organs are not one organ.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_24"></span>*Aph*. 24.[\*](#pp_24.md) Moreover, a difference
being established if a difference of *powers* be \[conceded\], there is
not a oneness \[of the organs\].

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

   <span id="pp_24a"></span>*a*. Even by the admission that a diversity
of *powers* belongs to one single organ, the diversity of organs is
established; because the *powers* are, assuredly, organs; therefore,
there is not a singleness of organ: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_24b"></span>*b*. But then \[it may be said\], there is
something unphilosophical in supposing various kinds of organs to arise
from one single Self-consciousness. To this he replies:

 

|                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Theoretical considerations cannot upset facts.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_25"></span>*Aph*. 25.[\*](#pp_25.md) A theoretical
discordance is not \[of any weight,\] in the case of what is matter of
ocular evidence.

   <span id="pp_25a"></span>*a*. This is simple.

   <span id="pp_25b"></span>*b*. He tells us that, of the single leading
organ, the Mind, the other ten are kinds of powers:

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

 

|                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Diversified operation of Mind.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_26"></span>*Aph*. 26.[\*](#pp_26.md) The Mind identifies
itself with both

   <span id="pp_26a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the Mind identifies
itself with the organs of intellection and of action.

   <span id="pp_26b"></span>*b*. Of his own accord, he explains the
meaning of the expression 'identifies itself with both:'

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   How this happens.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_27"></span>*Aph*. 27.[\*](#pp_27.md) By reason of the
varieties of transformation of \[which\] the Qualities \[are
susceptible\], there is a diversity \[of their product, the Mind,\]
according to circumstances.

   <span id="pp_27a"></span>*a*. As one single man supports a variety of
characters, through the force of association,—being, through association
with his beloved, a lover; through association with one indifferent,
indifferent; and, through association with some other, something
other,—so the Mind, also, through association with the organ of vision,
or any other, becomes various, from its becoming one with the organ of
vision, or any other; by its being \[thereby\] distinguished by the
modification of seeing, or the like. The argument in support of this is,
'of the Qualities,' &c.; the meaning being, because of the adaptability
of the Qualities, Goodness, &c., to varieties of transformation.

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

   <span id="pp_27b"></span>*b*. He mentions the object of the organs of
intellection and of action:

 

|                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What the organs deal with.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_28"></span>*Aph*. 28.[\*](#pp_28.md) Of both \[sets of
organs the object is that list of things\], beginning with Colour, and
ending with the dirt of Taste.

   <span id="pp_28a"></span>*a*.. The 'dirt' of the tastes of food, &c.,
means ordure, &c., \[into which the food, consisting of the *quality*
Taste, &c., is partly transformed\].

   <span id="pp_28b"></span>*b*. Of what Soul (*indra*), through what
service, these are termed Organs (*indriya*), both these things he tells
us:

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

 

|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The Organs and their possessors.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_29"></span>*Aph*. 29.[\*](#pp_29.md) The being the seer,
&c., belongs to the Soul; the instrumentality belongs to the Organs.

   <span id="pp_29a"></span>*a*. For, as a king, even without himself
energizing, becomes a warrior through his instrument, his army, by
directing this by orders simply, so the Soul, though quiescent, through
all the organs, of vision, &c., becomes a seer, a speaker, and a judger,
and the like, merely through the proximity called 'Conjunction;' because
it moves these, as the lodestone \[does the iron, without exerting any
effort\].

   <span id="pp_29b"></span>*b*. Now he mentions the special
modifications of the triad of internal organs:

 

|                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Difference in the internal organs.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_30"></span>*Aph*. 30.[\*](#pp_30.md) Of the three
\[internal organs\] there is a diversity among themselves.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

   <span id="pp_30a"></span>*a*. The aspect of Intellect is
attention<span id="page_209_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_209_note_1.md); of
Self-consciousness, conceit \[of personality\]; of the Mind, decision
and doubt.

   <span id="pp_30b"></span>*b*. He mentions, also, a common aspect of
the three:

 

|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A character common to the three.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_31"></span>*Aph*. 31.[\*](#pp_31.md) The five airs, viz.,
Breath, &c., are the modifications, in common, of the \[three internal\]
instruments.

   <span id="pp_31a"></span>*a*. That is to say: the five, in the shape
of Breath, &c., which are familiarly known as 'airs', because of their
circulating as the air does, these \[animal spirits\] are the joint or
common 'modification,' or kinds of altered form, 'of the instruments,'
i.e., of the triad of internal instruments.

   <span id="pp_31b"></span>*b*. The opinion is not ours, as it is that
of the Vaiśeshikas, <span id="page_210">p. 210</span> that the
modifications of the organs take place successively only, and not
simultaneously. So he says:

 

|                                                                                    |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Sense-impressions, &c., not excusively successive.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_32"></span>*Aph*. 32.[\*](#pp_32.md) The modifications of
the organs take place successively and simultaneously.

   <span id="pp_32a"></span>*a*. This is simple.

   <span id="pp_32b"></span>*b*. Lumping the modifications of the
understanding, with a view to showing how they are the cause of the
world, he, in the first place, exhibits \[them\]:

 

|                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The ideas which constitute the world.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_33"></span>*Aph*. 33.[\*](#pp_33.md) The modifications \[of
the understanding, which are to be shown to be the cause of the world,
and\] which are of five kinds, are \[some of them,\] painful and
\[others,\] not painful.<span
id="page_210_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_210_note_4.md)

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

   <span id="pp_33a"></span>*a*. That the modifications are of five
sorts is declared by Patanjali's aphorism, \[see Yoga Aphorisms, Book
I., § 6<span id="page_211_fr_2"></span>[2](#page_211_note_2.md)\]

   <span id="pp_33b"></span>*b*. He acquaints \[us\] with the nature of
Soul:

 

|                                                          |
|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Soul's relation thereto.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_34"></span>*Aph*. 34.[\*](#pp_34.md) On the cessation
thereof \[viz., of mundane influences\], its tincture<span
id="page_211_fr_4"></span>[4](#page_211_note_4.md) ceasing, it \[Soul,\]
abides in itself.

   <span id="pp_34a"></span>*a*. That is to say: during the state of
repose of these modifications, it \[the Soul\], the reflexion of these
having ceased, is abiding in itself; being, at *other* times, also, as
it were, in isolation, \[though seemingly not so\]. And to this effect
there is a triad of Aphorisms of the Yoga, \[viz., Book I., §§ 2, 3, and
4<span id="page_211_fr_6"></span>[6](#page_211_note_6.md)\].

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

   <span id="pp_34b"></span>*b*. He explains this by an illustration:

 

|                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   This illustrated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_35"></span>*Aph*. 35.[\*](#pp_35.md) And as \[by\] a
flower, the gem.

   <span id="pp_35a"></span>*a*. The 'and' implies that this is the
*reason* \[of what was asserted in the preceding aphorism\]; the meaning
being, as the gem \[is tinged, apparently,\] by a flower. As the gem
called rock-crystal, by reason of a flower of the Hibiscus, becomes red,
not abiding in its own state, and, on the removal thereof, becomes
colourless, abiding in its own state, in like manner \[is the Soul
apparently tinged by the adjunction of the Qualities\].

   <span id="pp_35b"></span>*b*. But then \[it may be asked\], by whose
*effort* does the aggregate of the organs come into operation; since
Soul is motionless, and since it is denied<span
id="page_212_fr_3"></span>[3](#page_212_note_3.md) that there is any Lord
\[or Demiurgus\]? To this he replies:

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   What moves the Organs to operate.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_36"></span>*Aph*. 36.[\*](#pp_36.md) The Organs also arise,
for the sake of Soul from the development of *desert*.

   <span id="pp_36a"></span>*a*. The meaning is, that, just as Nature
energizes 'for the sake of Soul,' so 'the Organs also arise;' i.e., the
energizing of the Organs is just in consequence of the development of
the deserts of the soul: \[see Yoga Aphorisms, Book II., § 13. *b*.\].
And the desert belongs entirely to the investment; \[the Soul not really
possessing either merit or demerit\].

   <span id="pp_36b"></span>*b*. He mentions an instance of a thing's
spontaneously energizing for the sake of another:

 

|                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An illustration.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_37"></span>*Aph*. 37.[\*](#pp_37.md) As the cow for the
calf.

   <span id="pp_37a"></span>*a*. As the cow, for the sake of the calf,
quite spontaneously secretes milk, and awaits no other effort, just so,
for the sake of the master, Soul, the Organs energize quite
spontaneously: such is the meaning. And it is *seen*, that, <span
id="page_214">p. 214</span> out of profound sleep, the understanding of
its own accord wakes up.

   <span id="pp_37b"></span>*b*. With reference to the question, how
many Organs there are, external and internal combined, he says:

 

|                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   The number of the Organs.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_38"></span>*Aph*. 38.[\*](#pp_38.md) Organ is of thirteen
sorts, through division of the subordinates.

   <span id="pp_38a"></span>*a*. The triad of internal organs, and the
ten external organs, combined, are thirteen. He says 'sorts,' in order
to declare that, of these, moreover, there is an infinity, through
\[their\] distinction into individuals. He says 'through division of the
subordinates,' with a reference to the fact, that it is *understanding*
which is the *principal* organ; the meaning being, because the organs
\[or functions,\] of the single organ, called understanding, are more
than one.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

   <span id="pp_38b"></span>*b*. But then, since understanding \[it
seems,\] alone is the principal instrument in furnishing its object \[of
emancipation\] to Soul, and the instrumentality of the others is
secondary, in this case what is \[meant by\] *secondariness*?<span
id="page_215_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_215_note_1.md) \[Why are they said to
be instrumental *at all*?\] In regard to this he says:

 

|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Efficiency of the Organs whence.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_39"></span>*Aph*. 39.[\*](#pp_39.md) Because the quality of
being most efficient is conjoined with the organs; as in the case of an
axe.

   <span id="pp_39a"></span>*a*. The quality of the \[principal\] organ,
the understanding, in the shape of being most efficient on behalf of
soul, exists, derivatively, in the \[other derivative\] organs.
Therefore it is made out that an organ is of thirteen kinds: such is the
connexion with the preceding aphorism:

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

   <span id="pp_39b"></span>*b*. 'As in the case of an axe.' As,
although the blow itself, since it is this that puts an end to our
non-possession of the result, is the principal efficient in the cutting,
yet the axe, also, is an efficient, because of its close proximity to
the quality of being the principal efficient, so \[here, also\]: such is
the meaning. He does not here say that Self-consciousness is secondarily
efficient, meaning to imply that it is one with the internal organ.<span
id="page_216_fr_*"></span>[\*](#page_216_note_*.md)

   <span id="pp_39c"></span>*c*. Specifying the precise state of the
case in regard to the condition of secondary and principal, he says:

 

|                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Preeminent efficiency of Mind illustrated.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_40"></span>*Aph*. 40.[\*](#pp_40.md) Among the two \[the
external and the internal organs\], the principal is Mind; just as, in
the world, among troops of dependants.

   <span id="pp_40a"></span>*a*. 'Among the two,' viz., the external and
the internal, 'Mind,' i.e., understanding, simply, is 'the principal,'
i.e., <span id="page_217">p. 217</span> chief; in short, is the
immediate cause; because it is that which furnishes Soul with its end;
just as, among troops of dependants, some one single person is the prime
minister of the king; and the others, governors of towns, &c., are his
subordinates: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_40b"></span>*b*. Here the word 'Mind' does not mean the
third internal organ, \[([§ 30. *a*.](#pp_30a).md) but Intellect, or 'the
Great One.'\]

   <span id="pp_40c"></span>*c*. He tells, in three aphorisms, the
reasons why Intellect \[or understanding\] is the principal:

 

|                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   A reason why Understanding is the principal.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_41"></span>*Aph*. 41.[\*](#pp_41.md) \[And Intellect is the
principal, or immediate and direct, efficient in Soul's emancipation;\]
because there is no wandering away.

   <span id="pp_41a"></span>*a*. That is to say: because it
\[understanding,\] pervades <span id="page_218">p. 218</span> all the
organs; or because there is no result apart from it.

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another reason.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_42"></span>*Aph*. 42.[\*](#pp_42.md) So, too, because it
\[the understanding,\] is the depository of all self-continuant
impressions.

   <span id="pp_42a"></span>*a*. Understanding alone is the depository
of all self-continuant impressions, and not the Sight, &c., or
Self-conconsciousness, or the Mind; else it could not happen that things
formerly seen, and heard, &c., would be remembered by the blind, and
deaf, &c.

 

|                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Another reason.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_43"></span>*Aph*. 43.[\*](#pp_43.md) And because we infer
this \[its preeminence\] by reason of its meditating.

   <span id="pp_43a"></span>*a*. That is to say: and because we infer
its preeminence, 'by reason of its meditating,' i.e., its modification
in the shape of meditation. For the modification of thought called
'meditation' is the noblest of all the modifications \[incident to Soul,
or pure Thought, whose blessedness, or state of emancipation, it is to
have no *modification* at all\]; and the Understanding itself which, as
being the depository thereof, is, further, named Thought \[*chitta*,
from the <span id="page_219">p. 219</span> same root as *chintá*<span
id="page_219_fr_1"></span>[1](#page_219_note_1.md)\], is nobler than the
organs whose modifications are other than this: such is the meaning.

   <span id="pp_43b"></span>*b*. But then, suppose that the modification
'meditation' belongs only to the *Soul*, \[suggests some one\]. To this
he replies:

 

|                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Meditation not essential to Soul.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_44"></span>*Aph*. 44.[\*](#pp_44.md) It cannot be of its
own nature.

   <span id="pp_44a"></span>*a*. That is to say: meditation cannot
belong to Soul essentially; because of the immobility \[of Soul; whereas
'meditation' is an effort\].

   <span id="pp_44b"></span>*b*. But then, if thus the preeminence
belongs to understanding alone, how was it said before \[at [§
26](#pp_26.md),\] that it is the *Mind* that takes the nature of both
\[sets of organs, in <span id="page_220">p. 220</span> apparent
contradiction to the view propounded at [§ 39](#pp_39.md)\]? To this he
replies:

 

|                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   An organ may be, relatively, principal, or secondary.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_45"></span>*Aph*. 45.[\*](#pp_45.md) The condition \[as
regards Soul's instruments,\] of secondary and principal is relative;
because of the difference of function.

   <span id="pp_45a"></span>*a*. In respect to the difference of
function, the condition, as secondary, or principal, of the instruments
\[of Soul\] is relative. In the operations of the Sight, &c., the Mind
is principal; and, in the operation of the Mind, Self-consciousness,
and, in the operation or Self-consciousness, Intellect, is principal
\[or precedent\].

   <span id="pp_45b"></span>*b*. But then, what is the cause of this
arrangement; viz., that, of this \[or that\] Soul, this \[or that\]
Intellect, alone, and not another Intellect, is the instrument? With
reference to this, he says:

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

 

|                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Every one reaps as he has sowed.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_46"></span>*Aph*. 46.[\*](#pp_46.md) The energizing \[of
this or that Intellect\] is for the sake of this \[or that Soul\];
because of \[its\] having been purchased by the works \[or deserts\] of
this \[or that Soul\]; just as in the world.

   <span id="pp_46a"></span>*a*. The meaning is, that, 'the energizing,'
i.e., all operation, of the instrument is for the sake of this \[or
that\] Soul; because of \[its\] having been purchased by this \[or
that\] Soul's works \[or deserts\]; just as in the world. As, in the
world \[or in ordinary affairs\], whatever axe, or the like, has been
purchased by the act, e.g., of buying, by whatever man, the operation of
that \[axe, or the like\], such as cleaving, is only for the sake of
that man \[who purchased it\]: such is the meaning. The import is, that
*therefrom* is the distributive allotment of instruments \[inquired
about under [§ 45. *b*.](#pp_45b.md)\]

   <span id="pp_46b"></span>*b*. Although there is *no* act in Soul,
because it is immovable, <span id="page_222">p. 222</span> still, since
it is the means of Soul's experience, it is *called* the act of Soul;
just like the victories, &c., of a king \[which are, really, the acts of
his servants\]; because of Soul's being the owner \[of the results of
acts; as the king is of the results of the actions of his troops\].

   <span id="pp_46c"></span>*c*. In order to make clear the chiefship of
Intellect, he sums up, \[as follows\]:

 

|                                             |
|---------------------------------------------|
| <span class="small">*   Summing up.*</span> |

   <span id="pp_47"></span>*Aph*. 47.[\*](#pp_47.md) Admitting that they
\[the various instruments of Soul, all\] equally act, the preeminence
belongs to Intellect; just as in the world, just as in the world.

   <span id="pp_47a"></span>*a*. Although the action of all the
instruments is the same, in being for the sake of Soul, still the
preeminence belongs to Intellect alone: just as in the world. The
meaning is, because it is just as the preeminence, in the world, belongs
to the prime minister, among the rulers of towns, and the rest, even
although there be no difference so far as regards their being \[all
alike workers\] for the sake of the king. Therefore, in all the
Institutes, Intellect alone is celebrated as 'the Great One.' The
repetition <span id="page_223">p. 223</span> \[viz., 'just as in the
world, just as in the world,'\] implies the completion of the Book.

   <span id="pp_47b"></span>*b*. So much for \[this abstract of\] the
Second Book, on the Products of Nature, in the commentary, on Kapila's
Declaration of the Sánkhya, composed by the venerable Vijnána Áchárya.

<span id="page_211_note_6"></span>[6](#page_211_fr_6.md) 'Concentration
(*yoga*) is the hindering of the modifications of the thinking
principle.' 'Then \[i.e., at the time of Concentration,\] <span
id="footnotes_page_212">p. 212</span> it \[the Soul,\] abides in the
form of the spectator \[without a spectacle\].' 'At other times \[than
that of Concentration\] it \[the Soul,\] is in the same form as the
modifications \[of the internal organ\].' Dr. Ballantyne's translation
is here quoted. *Ed*.

<span id="page_212_note_3"></span>[3](#page_212_fr_3.md) 'Demurred to' is

<span id="page_216_note_*"></span>[\*](#page_216_fr_*.md) Instead of 'it is
one with the internal organ,' read 'the internal organ is really one.'
The implication is, that *buddhi*, *ahankára*, and *manas* really make
one whole, called *manas*, in the wider sense of that term.

<span id="footnotes_page_216">p. 216</span>

<span id="page_219_note_1"></span>[1](#page_219_fr_1.md) The two words are,
respectively, from *chit* and *chint*, which are cognate. *Ed*.
