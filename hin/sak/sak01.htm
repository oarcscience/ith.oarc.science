<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T<SMALL>HE</SMALL> present work, both in its Sanskrit portion and in its English, is an amended reprint of three volumes,<A NAME="page_i_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_i_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> published in India, which have already become very scarce. An abridged form of those volumes,<A NAME="page_i_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_i_note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> which subsequently

<!------------------------page iv------------------------>

<A NAME="page_iv"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. iv</FONT></A>

appeared, contains nothing of the Sanskrit original but the Aphorisms.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While, in the following pages, all the corrections obtainable from the abridgment have been turned to account, an immense number of improved readings have been taken from another source. Three several times I carefully read Dr. Ballantyne's translation in as many different copies of it; entering suggestions, in the second copy, without reference to those which had been entered in the first, and similarly making independent suggestions in my third copy. All these<A NAME="page_iv_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_iv_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> were, on various occasions, submitted to Dr. Ballantyne; and such of them as did not meet his approval were crossed through. The residue, many more than a thousand, have been embodied

<!------------------------page v------------------------>

<A NAME="page_v"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. v</FONT></A>

in the ensuing sheets, but are not indicated,<A NAME="page_v_fr_1"></A><A HREF="#page_v_note_1"><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></A> as successively introduced. The renderings proposed in the footnotes are, for the most part, from among those which have recently occurred to me as eligible.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Dr. Ballantyne had any thought of reissuing, in whatever form, the volumes mentioned at the beginning of this Advertisement, I was unaware, till some years after he had made over the abridgment of them to Professor Cowell, for publication.<A NAME="page_v_fr_2"></A><A HREF="#page_v_note_2"><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></A> Otherwise, I should have placed at his disposal the materials towards improvement of his second edition, which, at the cost of no slight drudgery, are here made available.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The S&aacute;nkhya Aphorisms, in all the known commentaries on them, are exhibited word for word. The variants, now given, of the Aphorisms, afforded by accessible productions of that character, have been drawn from the works, of which only one has yet been printed, about to be specified:<A NAME="page_v_fr_3"></A><A HREF="#page_v_note_3"><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></A></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I. The <I>S&aacute;nkhya-pravachana-bh&aacute;shya</I>, by Vijn&aacute;na Bhikshu. Revelant particulars I have given elsewhere. My oldest MS. of it was transcribed in 1654.</P>

<A NAME="page_vi"><FONT SIZE="1" COLOR=GREEN>p. vi</FONT></A>

</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;II. The <I>K&aacute;pila-s&aacute;nkhya-pravachana-s&uacute;tra-v&#7771;itti</I>, by Aniruddha. Of this I have consulted, besides a MS. copied in 1818, formerly the property of Dr. Ballantyne, one which I procured to be copied, in 1855, from an old MS. without date.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;III. The <I>Laghhu-s&aacute;nkhya-s&uacute;tra-v&#7771;itti</I>, by Nagesa. Of this I have two MSS., both undated. One of them is entire; but the other is defective by the three first Books.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IV. The <I>S&aacute;nkhya-pravachana-s&uacute;tra-v&#7771;itti-s&aacute;ra</I>, by Ved&aacute;nti Mah&aacute;deva. Here, again, only one of two MSS. which I possess is complete. The other, which breaks off in the midst of the comment on Book II., Aph. 15, is, in places, freely intetpolated from No. I. Neither of them has a date.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly all my longer annotations, and some of the shorter, were scrutinized, while in the rough, by the learned Professor Cowell, but for whose searching criticisms, which cannot be valued too highly, they would, in several instances, have been far less accurate than they now are.</P>

The proof-sheets of only 32 pages of the whole, from the beginning, were read by Dr. Ballantyne; the rest, by Professor Cowell.</P>

<P>The title of the abridged form runs: "The S&aacute;nkhya Aphorisms of Kapila, with Extracts from Vijn&aacute;na Bhiks[h]u's Commentary," &amp;c. But this is a misrepresentation, as regards Book I., which takes up 63 pages out of the total of 175. The expository matter in that Book is derived, very largely, from other commentators than Vijn&aacute;na.

Ved&aacute;nti Mah&aacute;deva mainly supplies it at the outset, and, towards the end, well nigh exclusively, Aniruddha. Some share of it, however, will not be traced; it having been furnished by one of Dr. Ballantyne's pandits, whom I have repeatedly seen in the very act, as by his own acknowledgment, of preparing his elucidations.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_iv_note_1"></A><A HREF="#page_iv_fr_1">1</A> Many of them, especially in Books II.-VI., rest on readings of the original preferable to those which had been accepted.</P>

<P>Though not fully published till 1856, my edition of the <I>S&aacute;nkkya-pravachana-bh&aacute;shya</I>, its preface alone excepted, was in print as early as 1853; and Dr. Ballantyne had a copy of it. A few arbitrarily chosen words apart, his text, after Book I., is borrowed from it throughout, but with no mention of the fact. My advice was unheeded, that he should profit by the copious emendations which I had amassed and digested from better manuscripts than those to which I at first had access. Greatly to his disservice, he would not be induced even to look at them. It faring the same with my typographical corrections, he has, here and there, reproduced errors, more or less gross, which might easily have been avoided. See, for specimens. pp. 197, 288, 357, 373, 374, 381, 390.</P>
