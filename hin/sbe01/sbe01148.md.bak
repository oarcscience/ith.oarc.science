*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FOURTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Hope (â*s*â) is better than memory. Fired by hope does memory read
the sacred hymns, perform sacrifices, desire sons and cattle, desire
this world and the other. Meditate on hope.

2\. 'He who meditates on hope as Brahman, all his desires are fulfilled
by hope, his prayers are not in vain; he is, as it were, lord and master
as far as hope reaches--he who meditates on hope as Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than hope?'

'Yes, there is something better than hope.'

'Sir, tell it me.'
