### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. This then becomes perfect as a thousand of B*ri*hatî verses. Its
consonants <span id="fr_542"></span>[1](#fn_540) form its body, its
voice <span id="fr_543"></span>[2](#fn_541) (vowels) the Soul <span
id="fr_544"></span>[3](#fn_542), its sibilants <span
id="fr_545"></span>[4](#fn_543) the air of the breath.

2\. He who knew this became Vasish*th*a, he took this name from
thence <span id="fr_546"></span>[5](#fn_544).

3\. Indra verily declared this to Vi*s*vâmitra, and Indra verily
declared this to Bharadvâga. Therefore Indra is invoked by him as a
friend <span id="fr_547"></span>[6](#fn_545).

4\. This becomes perfect as a thousand of B*ri*hatî verses <span
id="fr_548"></span>[7](#fn_546), and of that hymn perfect with a
thousand Brihad verses, there are 36,000 syllables <span
id="fr_549"></span>[8](#fn_547). So many are also the thousands of days
of a hundred years (36,000). With the consonants they fill the nights,
with the vowels the days.

5\. This becomes perfect as a thousand of B*ri*hatî verses. He who knows
this, after this thousand of B*ri*hatîs thus accomplished, becomes full
of knowledge, full of the gods, full of Brahman, full of the immortal,
and then goes also to the gods.

6\. What I am (the worshipper), that is he (sun); what he is, that am I.

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

7\. This has been said by a *Ri*shi (Rv. I, 115, 1): 'The sun is the
self of all that moves and rests.'

8\. Let him look to that, let him look to that!
