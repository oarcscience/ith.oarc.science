### EIGHTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. There were once three men, well-versed in udgîtha <span
id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_104.md), *S*ilaka *S*âlâvatya, *K*aikitâyana,
Dâlbhya, and Pravâha*n*a *G*aivali. They said: 'We are well-versed in
udgîtha. Let us have a discussion on udgîtha.'

2\. They all agreed and sat down. Then Pravâha*n*a *G*aivali <span
id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_105.md) said: 'Sirs, do you both speak first,

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

for I wish to hear what two Brâhma*n*as <span
id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_106.md) have to say.

3\. Then *S*ilaka *S*âlâvatya said to *K*aikitâyana Dâlbhya: 'Let me ask
you.'

'Ask,' he replied.

4\. 'What is the origin of the Sâman?' 'Tone (svara),' he replied.

'What is the origin of tone?' 'Breath,' he replied.

'What is the origin of breath?' 'Food,' he replied.

'What is the origin of food?' 'Water,' he replied.

5\. 'What is the origin of water?' 'That world (heaven),' he replied.

'And what is the origin of that world?'--

He replied: 'Let no man carry the Sâman beyond the world of svarga
(heaven). We place (recognise) the Sâman in the world of svarga, for the
Sâman is extolled as svarga (heaven).'

6\. Then said Silaka Sâlâvatya to *K*aikitâyana Dâlbhya: 'O Dâlbhya, thy
Sâman is not firmly established. And if any one were to say, Your head
shall fall off (if you be wrong), surely your head would now fall.'

7\. 'Well then, let me know this from you, Sir,' said Dâlbhya.

'Know it,' replied Silaka Sâlâvatya.

'What is the origin of that world (heaven)?' 'This world,' he replied.

'And what is the origin of this world?'--

He replied: 'Let no man carry the Sâman beyond this world as its rest.
We place the Sâman

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

in this world as its rest, for the Sâman is extolled as rest.'

8\. Then said Pravâha*n*a *G*aivali to *S*ilaka *S*âlâvatya: 'Your Sâman
(the earth), O *S*âlâvatya, has an end. And if any one were to say, Your
head shall fall off (if you be wrong), surely your head would now fall.'

'Well then, let me know this from you, Sir,' said Sâlâvatya.

'Know it,' replied *G*aivali.
