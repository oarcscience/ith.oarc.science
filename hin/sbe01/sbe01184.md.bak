## SECOND ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_396.md).

1\. The two t*rik*as, Rv. VIII, 68, 1-3, â tvâ ratha*m* yathotaye, and
Rv. VIII, 2, 1-3, ida*m* vaso sutam andha*h*, form the first (pratipad)
and the second (anu*k*ara) of the Marutvatîya hymn.

2\. Both, as belonging to the one-day ceremonial <span
id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_397.md), are perfect in form. On that day much
is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for.
Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the
year the sacrificers rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows
this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot*ri* priest who knows this,
recites this hymn <span id="fr_400"></span>[3](#fn_398.md).

3\. In the second verse of (the Pragâtha <span
id="fr_401"></span>[4](#fn_399).md), indra nedîya ed ihi, pra sû tirâ
sa*k*îbhir ye ta ukthina*h* (Rv. VIII, 53, 5, 6), there occurs the word
ukthina*h*, reciters of hymns <span id="fr_402"></span>[5](#fn_400.md).
Verily, this day (the mahâvrata) is an uktha (hymn), and as endowed with
an uktha, the form of this day is perfect.

4\. In the first verse (of another Pragâtha) the word vîra, strong,
occurs (Rv. I, 40, 3), and as endowed with the word vîra, strong, the
form of this day is perfect.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

5\. In the second verse (of another Pragâtha) the word suvîryam,
strength, occurs (Rv. I. 40, 1), and as endowed with the word suvîrya,
strength, the form of this day is perfect.

6\. In the first verse (of another Pragâtha) the word ukthyam, to be
hymned, occurs (Rv. I, 40, 5). Verily, this day is an uktha, and as
endowed with an uktha, the form of this day is perfect.

7\. In the (Dhayyâ) verse agnir netâ (Rv. III, 2 0, 4) the word
v*ri*trahâ, killer of V*ri*tra, occurs. The killing of V*ri*tra is a
form (character) of Indra, this day (the mahâvrata) belongs to Indra,
and this is the (perfect) form of that day.

8\. In the (Dhayyâ) verse tva*m* soma kratubhi*h* sukratur bhû*h* (Rv.
I, 91, 2) the word v*ri*shâ <span id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_401.md),
powerful, occurs. Powerful is a form (character) of Indra, this day
belongs to Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.

9\. In the (Dhayyâ) verse pinvanty apa*h* (Rv. I, 64, 6) the word
vâ*g*inam, endowed with food, occurs. Endowed with food is a form
(character) of Indra, this day belongs to Indra, and this is the
(perfect) form of that day.

10\. In the same verse the word stanayantam, thundering, occurs. Endowed
with thundering is a form (character) of Indra, this day belongs to
Indra, and this is the (perfect) form of that day.

11\. In (the Pragâtha) pra va indrâya b*ri*hate (Rv. VIII, 89, 3) (the
word b*ri*hat occurs). Verily, b*ri*hat is mahat (great), and as endowed
with mahat, great, the form of this day (mahâvrata) is perfect.

12\. In (the Pragâtha) b*ri*had indrâya gâyata (Rv. VIII, 89, 1)

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the word b*ri*hat
occurs). Verily, b*ri*hat is mahat (great), and as endowed with mahat,
the form of this day is perfect.

13\. In (the Pragâtha) naki*h* sudâso ratham pary âsa na rîramad (Rv.
VII, 32, 10) the words paryâsa (he moved round) and na rîramad (he did
not enjoy) occur, and as endowed with the words paryasta and rânti the
form of this day is perfect <span id="fr_404"></span>[1](#fn_402.md).

He recites all (these) Pragâthas, in order to obtain all the days (of
the sacrifice), all the Ukthas <span id="fr_405"></span>[2](#fn_403.md),
all the P*ri*sh*th*as <span id="fr_406"></span>[3](#fn_404.md), all the
*S*astras <span id="fr_407"></span>[4](#fn_405.md), all the Pra-ugas <span
id="fr_408"></span>[5](#fn_406), and all the Savanas (libations.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_396"></span>[166:1](sbe01184.htm#fr_398.md) In the first
adhyâya the two hymns to be recited by the Hot*ri* priest at the
morning-libation (the â*g*ya and pra-uga *s*astra) have been considered.
Now follows the Marutvatîya hymn, to be recited by the Hot*ri* priest at
the noon-libation.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[166:2](sbe01184.htm#fr_399.md) Taken from the
Agnish*t*oma.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[166:3](sbe01184.htm#fr_400.md) Cf. I, 1, 3, 7-8.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[166:4](sbe01184.htm#fr_401.md) All these
Pragâthas consist of two verses expanded into a t*rik*a.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[166:5](sbe01184.htm#fr_402.md) Hotrâdaya
ukthina*h* *s*astri*n*a*h*.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[167:1](sbe01184.htm#fr_403.md) Cf. I, 2, 2, 14.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[168:1](sbe01184.htm#fr_404.md) Because the
performance of the Mahâvrata sacrifice moves the worshipper round to
another world and gives him enjoyment. Comm. It is difficult to surpass
the absurdity of these explanations. Na rîramat means no one stopped the
chariot of Sudâs. But even if it meant that no one rejoiced through the
chariot of Sudâs, it would be difficult to see how the negative of
enjoyment, mentioned in the hymn, could contribute to the perfection of
a sacrifice which is to confer positive enjoyment on the worshipper.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[168:2](sbe01184.htm#fr_405.md) The stotras
following after the Ya*g*ñâya*g*ñîya Sâman, serving for the
ukthya-kratus.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[168:3](sbe01184.htm#fr_406.md) The stotras of the
noon-libation, to be performed with the Rathantara, B*ri*hat, and other
Sâmans.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[168:4](sbe01184.htm#fr_407.md) The *s*astras,
recitations, accompanying the oblations of â*g*ya.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[168:5](sbe01184.htm#fr_408.md) The pra-ugas, a
division of *s*astras, described above.
