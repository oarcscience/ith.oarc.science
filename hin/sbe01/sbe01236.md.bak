------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. To him the Vedas yield no more milk, he has no luck in what he has
learnt (from his Guru); he does not know the path of virtue.

2\. This has also been declared by a *Ri*shi (Rv. X, 71, 6):--

3\. 'He who has forsaken the friend (the Veda), that knows his friends,
in his speech there is no luck. Though he hears, he hears in vain, for
he does not know the path of virtue.'

4\. Here it is clearly said that he has no luck in what he has learnt,
and that he does not know the path of virtue.

5\. Therefore let no one who knows this, lay the sacrificial fire
(belonging to the Mahâvrata) for another, let him not sing the Sâmans of
the Mahâvrata

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

for another, let him not recite the Sastras of that day for another.

6\. However, let him willingly do this for a father or for an Â*k*ârya;
for that is done really for himself.

7\. We have said that the incorporeal conscious self and the sun are
one <span id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_661.md). When these two become
separated <span id="fr_664"></span>[2](#fn_662.md), the sun is seen as if
it were the moon <span id="fr_665"></span>[3](#fn_663.md); no rays spring
from it; the sky is red like madder; the patient cannot retain the wind,
his head smells bad like a raven's nest:--let him know then that his
self (in the body) is gone, and that he will not live very long <span
id="fr_666"></span>[4](#fn_664.md).

8\. Then whatever he thinks he has to do,. let him do it, and let him
recite the following hymns: Yad anti ya*k* *k*a dûrake (Rv. IX, 67,
21-27); Ad it pratnasya retasa*h* (Rv. VIII, 6, 30); Yatra brahmâ
pavamâna (Rv. IX, 113, 6-11); Ud vaya*m* tamasas pari (Rv. I, 50, 10).

9\. Next, when the sun is seen pierced, and seems like the nave of a
cart-wheel, when he sees his own shadow pierced, let him know then that
it is so (as stated before, i. e. that he is going to die soon).

10\. Next, when he sees himself in a mirror or in the water with a
crooked head, or without a head <span id="fr_667"></span>[5](#fn_665.md),
or when his pupils are seen inverted <span
id="fr_668"></span>[6](#fn_666.md) or not straight, let him know then that
it is so.

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

11\. Next, let him cover his eyes and watch, then threads are seen as if
falling together <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_667.md). But if he does
not see them, let him know then that it is so.

12\. Next, let him cover his ears and listen, and there will be a sound
as if of a burning fire or of a carriage <span
id="fr_670"></span>[2](#fn_668.md). But if he does not hear it, let him
know then that it is so.

13\. Next, when fire looks blue like the neck of a peacock <span
id="fr_671"></span>[3](#fn_669.md), or when he sees lightning in a
cloudless sky, or no lightning in a clouded sky, or when he sees as it
were bright rays in a dark cloud, let him know then that it is so.

14\. Next, when he sees the ground as if it were burning, let him know
that it is so.

15\. These are the visible signs (from 7-14).

16\. Next come the dreams <span id="fr_672"></span>[4](#fn_670.md).

17\. If he sees a black man with black teeth, and that man kills him; or
a boar kills him; a monkey jumps on <span
id="fr_673"></span>[5](#fn_671.md) him; the wind carries him along quickly;
having swallowed gold he spits it out <span
id="fr_674"></span>[6](#fn_672.md); he eats honey; he chews stalks; he
carries a red lotus; he drives with asses and boars; wearing a wreath of
red flowers (naladas) he drives a black cow with a black calf, facing
the south <span id="fr_675"></span>[7](#fn_673.md),

18\. If a man sees any one of these (dreams), let

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

him fast, and cook a pot of milk, sacrifice it, accompanying each
oblation with a verse of the Râtri hymn (Rv. X, 12 7), and then, after
having fed the Brâhma*n*as, with other food (prepared at his house) eat
himself the (rest of the) oblation.

19\. Let him know that the person within all beings, not heard
here <span id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_674.md), not reached, not thought,
not subdued, not seen, not understood, not classed, but hearing,
thinking, seeing, classing, sounding, understanding, knowing, is his
Self.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[261:2](sbe01236.htm#fr_664.md) This separation of
the self of the sun and the conscious self within us is taken as a sign
of approaching death, and therefore a number of premonitory symptoms are
considered in this place.
