### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. THE Pupil asks: 'At whose wish does the mind sent forth proceed on
its errand? At whose command does the first breath go forth? At whose
wish do we utter this speech? What god directs the eye, or the ear?'

2\. The Teacher replies: 'It is the ear of the ear, the mind of the
mind, the speech of speech, the breath of breath, and the eye of the
eye. When freed (from the senses) the wise, on departing from this
world, become immortal <span id="fr_367"></span>[1](#fn_365).

3\. 'The eye does not go thither, nor speech, nor mind. We do not know,
we do not understand, how any one can teach it.

4\. 'It is different from the known, it is also above the unknown, thus
we have heard from those of old, who taught us this <span
id="fr_368"></span>[2](#fn_366).

5\. 'That which is not expressed by speech and

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

by which speech is expressed, that alone know as Brahman, not that which
people here adore.

6\. 'That which does not think by mind, and by which, they say, mind is
thought <span id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_367), that alone know as
Brahman, not that which people here adore.

7\. 'That which does not see by the eye, and by which one sees (the work
of) the eyes, that alone know as Brahman, not that which people here
adore.

8\. 'That which does not hear by the ear, and by which the ear is heard,
that alone know as Brahman, not that which people here adore.

9\. 'That which does not breathe by breath, and by which breath is
drawn, that alone know as Brahman, not that which people here adore.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_365"></span>[147:1](sbe01176.htm#fr_367) This verse admits
of various translations, and still more various explanations. Instead of
taking vâka*m*, like all the other words, as a nominative, we might take
them all as accusatives, governed by atimu*k*ya, and sa u prâ*n*asya
prâ*n*a*h* as a parenthetical sentence. What is meant by the ear of the
ear is very fully explained by the commentator, but the simplest
acceptation would seem to take it as an answer to the preceding
questions, so that the car of the ear should be taken for him who
directs the ear, i. e. the Self, or Brahman. This will become clearer as
we proceed.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[147:2](sbe01176.htm#fr_368) Cf. Î*s*a Up. II;
13.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[148:1](sbe01176.htm#fr_369) The varia lectio
manaso matam (supported also by the commentary) is metrically and
grammatically easier, but it may be, for that very reason, an
emendation.
