*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Understanding (vi*g*ñâna) is better than reflection. Through
understanding we understand the Rig-veda, the Ya*g*ur-veda, the
Sâma-veda, and as the fourth the Âtharvana, as the fifth the
Itihâsa-purâ*n*a <span id="fr_310"></span>[1](#fn_308), the Veda of the
Vedas, the Pitrya, the Râ*s*i, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vâkovâkya, the
Ekâyana, the Deva-vidyâ, the Brahma-vidyâ, the Bhûta-vidyâ, the
Kshatra-vidyâ, the Nakshatra-vidyâ, the Sarpa and Deva*g*ana-vidyâ,
heaven, earth, air, ether, water, fire, gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs,
trees, all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants; what is right and
what is wrong; what is true and what is false; what is good and what is
bad; what is pleasing and what is not pleasing; food and savour, this
world and that, all this we understand through understanding. Meditate
on understanding.

2\. 'He who meditates on understanding as Brahman, reaches the worlds
where there is understanding

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

and knowledge <span id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_309); he is, as it were,
lord and master as far as understanding reaches--he who meditates on
understanding as Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than understanding?'

'Yes, there is something better than understanding.'

'Sir, tell it me.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_308"></span>[115:1](sbe01141.htm#fr_310) See before, p.
109.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[116:1](sbe01141.htm#fr_311) The commentator
takes vi*g*ñâna here as understanding of sacred books, *g*ñâna as
cleverness with regard to other subjects.
