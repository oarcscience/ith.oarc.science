### FIFTEENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_183"></span>[1](#fn_182).

1\. The chest which has the sky for its circumference and the earth for
its bottom, does not decay, for the quarters are its sides, and heaven
its lid above. That chest is a treasury, and all things are within it.

2\. Its eastern quarter is called *G*uhû, its southern Sahamânâ, its
western Râ*g*ñî, its northern Subhûtâ <span
id="fr_184"></span>[2](#fn_183). The child of those quarters is Vâyu,
the air, and he who knows that the air is indeed the child of the
quarters, never weeps for his sons. 'I know the wind to be the child of
the quarters, may I never weep for my sons.'

3\. 'I turn to the imperishable chest with such and such and such <span
id="fr_185"></span>[3](#fn_184).' 'I turn to the Prâ*n*a (life) with
such and such and such.' 'I turn to Bhû*h* with such and such and such.'
'I turn to Bhuva*h* with such and such and such.' 'I turn to Sva*h* with
such and such and such.'

4\. 'When I said, I turn to Prâ*n*a, then Prâ*n*a means all whatever
exists here--to that I turn.'

5\. 'When I said, I turn to Bhû*h*, what I said is, I turn to the earth,
the sky, and heaven.'

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

6\. 'When I said, I turn to Bhuva*h*, what I said is, I turn to Agni
(fire), Vâyu (air), Âditya (sun).'

7\. 'When I said, I turn to Sva*h*, what I said is, I turn to the
*Rig*-veda, Ya*g*ur-veda, and Sâma-veda. That is what I said, yea, that
is what I said.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_182"></span>[49:1](sbe01073.htm#fr_183) The object of this
section, the Ko*s*avi*g*ñâna, is to show how the promise made in III,
13, 6, 'that a strong son should be born in a man's family,' is to be
fulfilled.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[49:2](sbe01073.htm#fr_184) These names are
explained by the commentator as follows: Because people offer libations
(*g*uhvati), turning to the east, therefore it is called *G*uhû. Because
evil doers suffer (sahante) in the town of Yama, which is in the south,
therefore it is called Sahamânâ. The western quarter is called Râ*g*ñî,
either because it is sacred to king Varu*n*a (râ*g*an), or on account of
the red colour (râ*g*a) of the twilight. The north is called Subhûtâ,
because wealthy beings (bhûtimat), like Kuvera &c., reside there.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[49:3](sbe01073.htm#fr_185) Here the names of
the sons are to be pronounced.
