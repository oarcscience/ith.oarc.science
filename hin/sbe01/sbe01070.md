Textual Heritage

### TWELFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The Gâyatrî <span id="fr_170"></span>[3](#fn_169) (verse) is
everything whatsoever here exists. Gâyatrî indeed is speech, for speech

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

sings forth (gâya-ti) and protects (trâya-te) everything that here
exists.

2\. That Gâyatrî is also the earth, for everything that here exists
rests on the earth, and does not go beyond.

3\. That earth again is the body in man, for in it the vital airs
(prâ*n*as <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_170), which are everything)
rest, and do not go beyond.

4\. That body again in man is the heart within man, for in it the
prâ*n*as (which are everything) rest, and do not go beyond.

5\. That Gâyatrî has four feet <span id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_171) and
is sixfold <span id="fr_173"></span>[3](#fn_172). And this is also
declared by a *Rik* verse (Rig-Veda X, 90, 3):--

6\. 'Such is the greatness of it (of Brahman, under the disguise of
Gâyatrî <span id="fr_174"></span>[4](#fn_173)); greater than it is the
Person <span id="fr_175"></span>[5](#fn_174) (purusha). His feet are all
things. The immortal with three feet is in heaven (i. e. in himself).'

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

7\. The Brahman which has been thus described (as immortal with three
feet in heaven, and as Gâyatrî) is the same as the ether which is around
us;

8\. And the ether which is around us, is the same as the ether which is
within us. And the ether which is within us,

9\. That is the ether within the heart. That ether in the heart (as
Brahman) is omnipresent and unchanging. He who knows this obtains
omnipresent and unchangeable happiness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_169"></span>[44:3](sbe01070.htm#fr_170) The Gâyatrî is one
of the sacred metres, and is here to be meditated on as Brahman. It is
used in the sense of verse, and as the name of a famous hymn. The
Gâyatrî is often praised as the most powerful metre, and whatever can be
obtained by means of the recitation of Gâyatrî verses is described as
the achievement of the Gâyatrî. The etymology of gâyatrî from gai and
trâ is, of course, fanciful.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[45:1](sbe01070.htm#fr_171) The prâ*n*as may be
meant for the five senses, as explained in *Kh*. I, 2, 1; II, 7, 1; or
for the five breathings, as explained immediately afterwards in III, 13,
1. The commentator sees in them everything that here exists (*Kh*. Up.
III, 15, 4), and thus establishes the likeness between the body and the
Gâyatrî. As Gâyatrî is the earth, and the earth the body, and the body
the heart, Gâyatrî is in the end to be considered as the heart.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[45:2](sbe01070.htm#fr_172) The four feet are
explained as the four quarters of the Gâyatrî metre, of six syllables
each. The Gâyatrî really consists of three feet of eight syllables each.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[45:3](sbe01070.htm#fr_173) The Gâyatrî has
been identified with all beings, with speech, earth, body, heart, and
the vital airs, and is therefore called sixfold. This, at least, is the
way in which the commentator accounts for the epithet 'sixfold.'

<span id="fn_173"></span>[45:4](sbe01070.htm#fr_174) Of Brahman modified
as Gâyatrî, having four feet, and being sixfold.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[45:5](sbe01070.htm#fr_175) The real Brahman,
unmodified by form and name.
