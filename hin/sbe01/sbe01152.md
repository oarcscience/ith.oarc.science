*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### EIGHTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'When one perceives, then one understands. One who does not
perceive, does not understand. Only he who perceives, understands. This
perception, however, we must desire to understand.'

'Sir, I desire to understand it.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_317"></span>[121:1](sbe01150.htm#fr_319) As Nârada asks no
further, whether there is anything better, higher, truer than prâ*n*a,
he is supposed to be satisfied with his belief that prâ*n*a is the
Highest Being. Sanatkumâra, however, wishes to lead him on to a still
higher view; hence the paragraphs which follow from 16 to 26.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[121:2](sbe01151.htm#fr_320) He would, for
instance, call fire real, not knowing that fire is only a mixture of the
three elements (cf. VI, 4), the rûpatraya, a mere variety (vikâra), and
name (nâman).
