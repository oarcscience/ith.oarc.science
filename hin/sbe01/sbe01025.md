### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Let a man meditate on the syllable Om, for the udgîtha is sung
beginning with Om. And this is the full account of the syllable Om--

2\. The Devas, being afraid of death, entered upon (the performance of
the sacrifice prescribed in) the threefold knowledge (the three Vedas).
They covered themselves with the metrical hymns. Because they covered
(*kh*ad) themselves with the hymns, therefore the hymns are called
*kh*andas.

3\. Then, as a fisherman might observe a fish in the water, Death
observed the Devas in the *Rik*, Ya*g*us, and Sâman-(sacrifices). And
the Devas seeing this, rose from the *Rik*, Ya*g*us, and
Sâman-sacrifices, and entered the Svara <span
id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_90), i.e. the Om (they meditated on the Om.md).

4\. When a man has mastered the Rig-veda, he says quite loud Om; the
same, when he has mastered the Sâman and the Ya*g*us. This Svara is the
imperishable (syllable), the immortal, free from fear. Because the Devas
entered it, therefore they became immortal, and free from fear.

5\. He who knowing this loudly pronounces (pra*n*auti) <span
id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_91.md)- that syllable, enters the same
(imperishable) syllable, the Svara, the immortal, free from fear, and
having entered it, becomes immortal, as the Devas are immortal.
