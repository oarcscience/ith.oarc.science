Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The *Rik* (veda) is this earth, the Sâman (veda) is fire. This Sâman
(fire) rests on that *Rik* (earth) <span id="fr_96"></span>[4](#fn_95.md).
Therefore the Sâman is sung as resting on the *Rik*.

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sâ is this earth,
ama is fire, and that makes Sâma.

2\. The *Rik* is the sky, the Sâman air. This Sâman (air) rests on that
*Rik* (sky). Therefore the Sâman is sung as resting on the *Rik*. Sâ is
the sky, ama the air, and that makes Sâma.

3\. *Rik* is heaven, Sâman the sun. This Sâman (sun) rests on that *Rik*
(heaven). Therefore the Sâman is sung as resting on the *Rik*. Sâ is
heaven, ama the sun, and that makes Sâma.

4\. *Rik* is the stars, Sâman the moon. This Sâman (moon) rests on that
*Rik* (stars). Therefore the Sâman is sung as resting on the *Rik*. Sâ
is the stars, ama the moon, and that makes Sâma.

5\. *Rik* is the white light of the sun, Sâman the blue exceeding
darkness <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_96) (in the sun.md). This Sâman
(darkness) rests on that *Rik* (brightness). Therefore the Sâman is sung
as resting on the *Rik*.

6\. Sâ is the white light of the sun, ama the blue exceeding darkness,
and that makes Sâma.

Now that golden <span id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_97.md) person, who is seen
within the sun, with golden beard and golden hair, golden altogether to
the very tips of his nails,

7\. Whose eyes are like blue lotus's <span
id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_98), his name is ut, for he has risen (udita.md)
above all evil. He also who knows this, rises above all evil.

8\. *Rik* and Sâman are his joints, and therefore he is udgîtha. And
therefore he who praises him

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the ut) is called
the Ud-gât*ri* <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_99) (the out-singer.md). He
(the golden person, called ut) is lord of the worlds beyond that (sun),
and of all the wishes of the Devas (inhabiting those worlds). So much
with reference to the Devas.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_95"></span>[12:4](sbe01027.htm#fr_96.md) The Sâma verses are
mostly taken from the Rig-veda.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[13:1](sbe01027.htm#fr_97.md) The darkness which is
seen by those who can concentrate their sight on the sun.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[13:2](sbe01027.htm#fr_98.md) Bright as gold.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[13:3](sbe01027.htm#fr_99.md) The colour of the
lotus is described by a comparison with the Kapyâsa, the seat of the
monkey (kapip*ri*sh*th*ânto yena upavi*s*ati), It was probably a
botanical name.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[14:1](sbe01027.htm#fr_100.md) Name of the
principal priest of the Sâma-veda.
