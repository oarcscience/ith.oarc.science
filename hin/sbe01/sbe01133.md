1\. 'If a man is ill, his relatives assemble round him and ask: "Dost
thou know me? Dost thou know me?" Now as long as his speech is not

merged in his mind, his mind in breath, breath in heat (fire), heat in
the Highest Being (devatâ), he knows them.

2\. 'But when his speech is merged in his mind, his mind in breath,
breath in heat (fire), heat in the Highest Being, then he knows them
not.

'That which is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has its self.
It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O *S*vetaketu, art it.'

'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.'

'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_298"></span>[107:2](sbe01133.htm#fr_300.md) The question
supposed to be asked is: By what degrees a man, who has been properly
instructed in the knowledge of Brahman, obtains the Sat, or returns to
the True. To judge from the text both he who knows the True and he who
does not, reach, when they die, the Sat, passing from speech to mind and
breath and heat (fire). But whereas he who knows, remains in the Sat,
they who do not <span id="page_108">p. 108</span> know, return again to
a new form of existence. It is important to observe that the commentator
denies that he who knows, passes at his death through the artery of the
head to the sun, and then to the Sat. He holds that with him who knows
there is no further cause for delay, and that as soon as he dies, he
returns to the Sat.
