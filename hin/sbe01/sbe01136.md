*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Speech is better than a name. Speech makes us understand the
*Ri*g-veda, Ya*g*ur-veda, Sâma-veda, and as the fourth the Âtharvana, as
the fifth the Itihâsa-purâ*n*a, the Veda of the Vedas, the Pitrya, the
Râ*s*i, the Daiva, the Nidhi, the Vâkovâkya, the Ekâyana, the
Deva-vidyâ, the Brahma-vidyâ, the Kshatra-vidyâ, the Nakshatra-vidyâ,
the Sarpa and Deva*g*ana-vidyâ; heaven, earth, air, ether, water, fire,
gods, men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees, all beasts down to worms,
midges, and ants; what is right and what is wrong; what is true and what
is false; what is good and what is bad; what is pleasing and what is not
pleasing. For if there were no speech, neither right nor wrong would be
known <span id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_302.md), neither the true nor the
false, neither the good nor the bad, neither the pleasant nor the
unpleasant. Speech makes us understand all this. Meditate on speech.

2\. 'He who meditates on speech as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and
master as far as speech reaches he who meditates on speech as Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than speech

'Yes, there is something better than speech.'

'Sir, tell it me.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_302"></span>[111:1](sbe01136.htm#fr_304.md) The commentator
explains vya*g*ñâpayishyat by avi*g*ñâtam abhavishyat. Possibly
h*ri*daya*g*ño stands for h*ri*daya*g*ñam.
