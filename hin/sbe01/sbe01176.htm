<p>1. THE Pupil asks: 'At whose wish does the mind sent forth proceed on its errand? At whose command does the first breath go forth? At whose wish do we utter this speech? What god directs the eye, or the ear?'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_365"></A><A HREF="sbe01176.htm#fr_367">147:1</A> This verse admits of various translations, and still more various explanations. Instead of taking v&acirc;ka<I>m</I>, like all the other words, as a nominative, we might take them all as accusatives, governed by atimu<I>k</I>ya, and sa u pr&acirc;<I>n</I>asya pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> as a parenthetical sentence. What is meant by the ear of the ear is very fully explained by the commentator, but the simplest acceptation would seem to take it as an answer to the preceding questions, so that the car of the ear should be taken for him who directs the ear, i. e. the Self, or Brahman. This will become clearer as we proceed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_366"></A><A HREF="sbe01176.htm#fr_368">147:2</A> Cf. &Icirc;<I>s</I>a Up. II; 13.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_367"></A><A HREF="sbe01176.htm#fr_369">148:1</A> The varia lectio manaso matam (supported also by the commentary) is metrically and grammatically easier, but it may be, for that very reason, an emendation.</P>
