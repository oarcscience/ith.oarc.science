### THIRD KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_238"></span>[2](#fn_237).

1\. *S*vetaketu Âru*n*eya went to an assembly <span
id="fr_239"></span>[3](#fn_238) of the Pañ*k*âlas. Pravâha*n*a
*G*aivali <span id="fr_240"></span>[4](#fn_239) said to him: 'Boy, has
your father instructed you?' 'Yes, Sir,' he replied.

2\. 'Do you know to what place men go from here?' 'No, Sir,' he replied.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

'Do you know how they return again?' 'No Sir,' he replied.

'Do you know where the path of Devas and the path of the fathers
diverge?' 'No, Sir,' he replied.

3\. 'Do you know why that world <span id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_240)
never becomes full?' 'No, Sir,' he replied.

'Do you know why in the fifth libation water is called Man <span
id="fr_242"></span>[2](#fn_241)? No, Sir,' he replied.

4\. 'Then why did you say (you had been) instructed? How could anybody
who did not know these things say that he had been instructed?' Then the
boy went back sorrowful to the place of his father, and said: 'Though
you had not instructed me, Sir, you said you had instructed me.

5\. 'That fellow of a Râ*g*anya, asked me five questions, and I could
not answer one of them.' The father said: 'As you have told me these
questions of his, I do not know any one of them <span
id="fr_243"></span>[3](#fn_242). If I knew these questions, how should I
not have told you <span id="fr_244"></span>[4](#fn_243)?'

6\. Then Gautama went to the king's place, and when he had come to him,
the king offered him proper respect. In the morning the king went out on
his way to the assembly <span id="fr_245"></span>[5](#fn_244). The king
said to him:

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Sir, Gautama, ask
a boon of such things as men possess.' He replied: 'Such things as men
possess may remain with you. Tell me the speech which you addressed to
the boy.'

7\. The king was perplexed, and commanded him, saying: 'Stay with me
some time.' Then he said: 'As (to what) you have said to me, Gautama,
this knowledge did not go to any Brâhma*n*a before you, and therefore
this teaching belonged in all the worlds to the Kshatra class alone.
Then he began:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_237"></span>[76:2](sbe01097.htm#fr_238) This story is more
fully told in the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka VI, 2, *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a XIV,
8, 16.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[76:3](sbe01097.htm#fr_239) Samiti, or
parishad, as in the B*ri*h. Âr.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[76:4](sbe01097.htm#fr_240) He is the same
Kshatriya sage who appeared in I, 8, 1, silencing the Brâhmans.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[77:1](sbe01097.htm#fr_241) That of the
fathers. Comm.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[77:2](sbe01097.htm#fr_242) Or, according to
others, why the water has a human voice; purushavâ*k*a*h* in B*ri*h. Âr.
XIV, 9, 3.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[77:3](sbe01097.htm#fr_243) I doubt whether the
elliptical construction of these sentences is properly filled out by the
commentator. In the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka the construction is much easier.
'You know me well enough to know that whatever I know, I told you.'

<span id="fn_243"></span>[77:4](sbe01097.htm#fr_244) I read avedishyam,
though both the text and commentary give avadishyam. Still viditavân
asmi points to an original avedishyam, and a parallel passage, VI, 1, 7,
confirms this emendation.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[77:5](sbe01097.htm#fr_245) Cf. *Kh*. Up. V,
II, 5.
