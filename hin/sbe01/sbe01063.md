*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FIFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The upward rays of the sun are the honey cells above. The secret
doctrines are the bees, Brahman (the Om) is the flower, the water is the
nectar.

2\. Those secret doctrines (as bees) brooded over Brahman (the Om); and
from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its (nectar) essence, fame, glory of
countenance, brightness, vigour, strength, and health.

3\. That flowed forth, and went towards the sun. And that forms what
seems to stir in the centre of the sun.

4\. These (the different colours in the sun) are the essences of the
essences. For the Vedas are essences (the best things in the world); and
of them (after they have assumed the form of sacrifice) these (the
colours rising to the sun) are again the essences. They are the nectar
of the nectar. For the Vedas are nectar (immortal), and of them these
are the nectar.
