### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Next follow the imprecations <span id="fr_643"></span>[1](#fn_641.md).

2\. Let him know that breath <span id="fr_644"></span>[2](#fn_642.md) is
the beam (on which the whole house of the body rests).

3\. If any one (a Brâhma*n*a or another man) should chide him, who by
meditation has become that breath as beam <span
id="fr_645"></span>[3](#fn_643.md), then, if he thinks himself strong, he
says: 'I grasped the breath, the beam, well; thou dost not prevail
against me who have grasped the breath as the beam.' Let him say to him:
'Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.'

4\. But if he thinks himself not strong, let him say to him: 'Thou
couldst not grasp him who wishes to grasp the breath as the beam.
Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.'

5\. And whatever the reciter shall say to one who speaks to him or does
not speak to him, depend upon it, it will come to pass. But to a
Brâhma*n*a let him not say anything except what is auspicious. Only he
may curse a Brâhma*n*a in excessive wealth. Nay, not even in excessive
wealth should he curse a Brâhma*n*a, but he should say, 'I bow before
Brâhma*n*as,'--thus says *S*ûravîra Mâ*nd*ûkeya.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_641"></span>[252:1](sbe01230.htm#fr_643.md) The commentator
explains anuvyâhâra, not as imprecations, but as referring to those who
leach or use the imprecations, such imprecations being necessary to
guard against the loss of the benefits accruing from the meditation and
worship here described; such teachers say what follows.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[252:2](sbe01230.htm#fr_644.md) Breath, the union
of mind and speech, as explained before. This is the opinion of Sthavira
*S*âkalya, cf. III, 2, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[252:3](sbe01230.htm#fr_645.md) If he should tell
him that he did not meditate on breath properly.
