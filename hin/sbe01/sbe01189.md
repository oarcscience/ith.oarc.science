Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. And here they ask: 'What is the beginning of this day?' Let him say:
'Mind and speech <span id="fr_432"></span>[2](#fn_430.md).'

2\. All desires dwell in the one (mind), the other yields all desires.

3\. All desires dwell in the mind, for with the mind he conceives all
desires.

4\. All desires come to him who knows this.

5\. Speech yields all desires, for with speech he declares all his
desires.

6\. Speech yields all desires to him who knows this.

7\. Here they say: 'Let him not begin this day with a *Rik*, a Ya*g*us,
or a Sâman verse (divine speech), for it is said, he should not start
with a *Rik*, a Ya*g*us, or a Sâman <span
id="fr_433"></span>[3](#fn_431.md).'

8\. Therefore, let him say these Vyâh*ri*tis (sacred interjections)
first.

9\. These interjections Bhûs, Bhuvas, Svar are the three Vedas, Bhûs the
*Rig*-veda, Bhuvas the Ya*g*ur-veda, Svar the Sâma-veda. Therefore (by

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

intercalating these) he does not begin simply with a *Rik*, Ya*g*us, or
Sâman verse, he does not start with a *Rik*, Ya*g*us, or Sâman verse.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_430"></span>[177:2](sbe01189.htm#fr_432.md) Mind, to think
about the hymns which have to be recited; speech, to recite them without
a flaw.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[177:3](sbe01189.htm#fr_433.md) It is doubtful
whether neyâd *ri*ka*h* and apaga*kkh*et can have this meaning. However,
what is intended is clear, viz. that the priest, even after having
uttered the sound Him, should not immediately begin with verses from the
Vedas, but should intercalate the three syllables bhûr bhuva*h* svar,
or, if taken singly, bhûs, bhuvas, svar.
