Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## THIRD ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Let him begin this day <span id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_427) with
singing 'Him,' thus they say.

2\. Verily, the sound Him is Brahman, that day also is Brahman. He who
knows this, obtains Brahman even by Brahman.

3\. As he begins with the sound Him, surely that masculine sound of Him
and the feminine *Rik* (the verse) make a couple. Thus he makes a couple
at the beginning of the hymn in order to get offspring <span
id="fr_430"></span>[3](#fn_428). He who knows this, gets cattle and
offspring.

4\. Or, as he begins with the sound Him, surely like a wooden spade, so
the sound Him serves to dig up Brahman (the sap of the Veda). And as a
man wishes to dig up any, even the hardest soil, with a spade, thus he
digs up Brahman.

5\. He who knows this digs up, by means of the sound Him, everything he
may desire.

6\. If he begins with the sound Him, that sound is the holding apart of
divine and human speech.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

Therefore, he who begins, after having uttered the sound Him, holds
apart divine and human speech <span id="fr_431"></span>[1](#fn_429).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_427"></span>[176:2](sbe01188.htm#fr_429) The
Nishkevalya-*s*astra, of the noon-libation; Cf. I, 2, 2, 1.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[176:3](sbe01188.htm#fr_430) Cf. I, 2, 4, 10.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[177:1](sbe01188.htm#fr_431) Human speech is
the ordinary speech, divine speech that of the Veda. Thus between the
hymns, or the divine speech, and the ordinary language of conversation
the sound Him is interposed as a barrier.
