### TENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_209.md).

1\. Upako*s*ala Kâmalâyana dwelt as a Brahma*k*ârin (religious student)
in the house of Satyakâma *G*âbâla. He tended his fires for twelve
years. But the teacher, though he allowed other pupils (after they had
learnt the sacred books) to depart to their own homes, did not allow
Upakosala to depart.

2\. Then his wife said to him: 'This student, who is quite exhausted
(with austerities), has carefully tended your fires. Let not the fires
themselves blame you, but teach him.' The teacher, however, went away on
a journey without having taught him.

The student from sorrow was not able to eat.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Then the wife of
the teacher said to him: 'Student, eat! Why do you not eat?' He said:
'There are many desires in this man here, which lose themselves in
different directions. I am full of sorrows, and shall take no food.'

4\. Thereupon the fires said among themselves: 'This student, who is
quite exhausted, has carefully tended us. Well, let us teach him.' They
said to him:

5\. 'Breath is Brahman, Ka (pleasure) is Brahman, Kha (ether) is
Brahman.'

He said: 'I understand that breath is Brahman, but I do not understand
Ka or Kha <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_210.md).'

They said: 'What is Ka is Kha, what is Kha is Ka <span
id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_211.md).' They therefore taught him Brahman as
breath, and as the ether (in the heart) <span
id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_212.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_209"></span>[64:3](sbe01087.htm#fr_210.md) The
Upako*s*ala-vidyâ teaches first Brahman as the cause, and then in its
various forms, and is therefore called âtmavidyâ and agnividyâ.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[65:1](sbe01087.htm#fr_211.md) I do not
understand, he means, how Ka, which means pleasure, and is non-eternal,
and how Kha, which means ether, and is not intelligent, can be Brahman.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[65:2](sbe01087.htm#fr_212.md) The commentator
explains as follows:--Ka is pleasure, and Kha is ether, but these two
words are to determine each other mutually, and thus to form one idea.
Ka therefore does not mean ordinary pleasures, but pleasures such as
belong to Kha, the ether. And Kha does not signify the ordinary outward
ether, but the ether in the heart, which alone is capable of pleasure.
What is meant by Ka and Kha is therefore the sentient ether in the
heart, and that is Brahman, while Prâ*n*a, breath, is Brahman, in so far
as it is united with the ether in the heart.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[65:3](sbe01087.htm#fr_213.md) And as its ether,
i.e. as the ether in the heart, the Brahman, with which prâ*n*a is
connected. Comm.
