### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. She replied: 'It is Brahman. It is through the victory of Brahman
that you have thus become great.' After that he knew that it was
Brahman.

2\. Therefore these Devas, viz. Agni, Vâyu, and Indra, are, as it were,
above the other gods, for they touched it (the Brahman) nearest <span
id="fr_374"></span>[2](#fn_372).

3\. And therefore Indra is, as it were, above the other gods, for he
touched it nearest, he first knew it.

4\. This is the teaching of Brahman, with regard to the gods
(mythological): It is that which now

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

flashes forth in the lightning, and now vanishes again.

5\. And this is the teaching of Brahman, with regard to the body
(psychological): It is that which seems to move as mind, and by it
imagination remembers again and again <span
id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_373).

6\. That Brahman is called Tadvana <span
id="fr_376"></span>[2](#fn_374), by the name of Tadvana it is to be
meditated on. All beings have a desire for him who knows this.

7\. The Teacher: 'As you have asked me to tell you the Upanishad, the
Upanishad has now

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

been told you. We have told you the Brâhmî Upanishad.

8\. 'The feet on which that Upanishad stands are penance, restraint,
sacrifice; the Vedas are all its limbs <span
id="fr_377"></span>[1](#fn_375), the True is its abode.

9\. 'He who knows this Upanishad, and has shaken off all evil, stands in
the endless, unconquerable <span id="fr_378"></span>[2](#fn_376) world
of heaven, yea, in the world of heaven.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_372"></span>[151:2](sbe01179.htm#fr_374) The next phrase
was borrowed from § 3, without even changing the singular to the plural.
As Indra only found out that it was Brahman, the original distinction
between Indra and the other gods, who only came near to it, was quite
justified. Still it might be better to adopt the var. lect. sa hy etat
in § 2.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[152:1](sbe01179.htm#fr_375) I have translated
these paragraphs very differently from *S*aṅkara and other interpreters.
The wording is extremely brief, and we can only guess the original
intention of the Upanishad by a reference to other passages. Now the
first teaching of Brahman, by means of a comparison with the gods or
heavenly things in general, seems to be that Brahman is what shines
forth suddenly like lightning. Sometimes the relation between the
phenomenal world and Brahman is illustrated by the relation between
bubbles and the sea, or lightning and the unseen heavenly light (Mait.
Up. V 1, 35). In another passage, *Kh*. Up. VIII, 12, 2, lightning, when
no longer seen, is to facilitate the conception of the reality of
things, as distinct from their perceptibility. I think, therefore, that
the first simile, taken from the phenomenal world, was meant to show
that Brahman is that which appears for a moment in the lightning, and
then vanishes from our sight.

The next illustration is purely psychological. Brahman is proved to
exist, because our mind moves towards things, because there is something
in us which moves and perceives, and because there is something in us
which holds our perceptions together (saṅkalpa), and revives them again
by memory.

I give my translation as hypothetical only, for certainty is extremely
difficult to attain, when we have to deal with these enigmatical sayings
which, when they were first delivered, were necessarily accompanied by
oral explanations.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[152:2](sbe01179.htm#fr_376) Tadvana, as a name
of Brahman, is explained by 'the desire of it,' and derived from van, to
desire, the same as vâñ*kh*.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[153:1](sbe01179.htm#fr_377) It is impossible
to adopt *S*aṅkara's first rendering, 'the Vedas and all the Aṅgas,'
i.e. the six subsidiary doctrines. He sees himself that sarvâṅgâni
stands in opposition to pratish*th*â and âyatana, but seeing Veda and
Aṅga together, no Brahman could help thinking of the Vedâṅgas.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[153:2](sbe01179.htm#fr_378) Might we read
a*g*yeye for *g*yeye? cf. Satap. Brâhm. XI, 5, 7, 1.
