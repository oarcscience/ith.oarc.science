### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. Then *G*âna*s*ruti Pautrâya*n*a took six hundred cows, a necklace,
and a carriage with mules, went to Raikva and said:

2\. 'Raikva, here are six hundred cows, a necklace, and a carriage with
mules; teach me the deity which you worship.'

3\. The other replied: 'Fie, necklace and carriage be thine, O *S*ûdra,
together with the cows.'

Then *G*âna*s*ruti Pautrâya*n*a took again a thousand cows, a necklace,
a carriage with mules, and his own daughter, and went to him.

4\. He said to him: 'Raikva, there are a thousand cows, a necklace, a
carriage with mules, this wife, and this village in which thou dwellest.
Sir, teach me!'

5\. He, opening her mouth <span id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_198.md), said:
'You have

brought these (cows and other presents), O *S*ûdra, but only by that

age. The commentator translates, 'Raikva, knowing her mouth to be the
door of knowledge, i. e. knowing that for her he might impart his
knowledge to *G*âna*s*ruti, and that <span id="page_58">p. 58</span>
*G*âna*s*ruti by bringing such rich gifts had become a proper receiver
of knowledge, consented to do what he had before refused.'

supplies adât, the king gave the villages to him.
