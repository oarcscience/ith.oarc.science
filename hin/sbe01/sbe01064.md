### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. On the first of these nectars (the red light, which represents fame,
glory of countenance, vigour, strength, health) the Vasus live, with
Agni at their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy
by seeing the nectar.

2\. They enter into that (red) colour, and they rise from that
colour <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_164).

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Vasus, with Agni
at their head, he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, too, having
entered that colour, rises again from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west <span
id="fr_166"></span>[2](#fn_165), so long does he follow the sovereign
supremacy of the Vasus.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_164"></span>[41:1](sbe01064.htm#fr_165) This is differently
explained by the commentator. He takes it to mean that, when the Vasus
have gone to the sun, and see that there is no opportunity for enjoying
that colour, they rest; but when they see that there is an opportunity
for enjoying it, they exert themselves for it. I think the colour is
here taken for the colour of the morning, which the Vasus enter, and
from which they go forth again.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[41:2](sbe01064.htm#fr_166) 1. East: Vasus:
red: Agni. 2. South: Rudras: white: Indra. 3. West: Âditya: dark:
Varu*n*a. 4. North: Marut: very dark: Soma. 5. Upward: Sâdhya: centre:
Brahman.
