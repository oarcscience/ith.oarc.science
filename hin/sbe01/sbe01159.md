1\. 'The Infinite indeed is below, above, behind, before, right and
left--it is indeed all this.

'Now follows the explanation of the Infinite as

the I: I am below, I am above, I am behind, before, right and left--I am
all this.

2\. 'Next follows the explanation of the Infinite as the Self: Self is
below, above, behind, before, right and left--Self is all this.

'He who sees, perceives, and understands this, loves the Self, delights
in the Self, revels in the Self, rejoices in the Self--he becomes a
Svarâ*g*, (an autocrat or self-ruler); he is lord and master in all the
worlds.

'But those who think differently from this, live in perishable worlds,
and have other beings for their rulers.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_320"></span>[123:1](sbe01157.htm#fr_322.md) Bhûman is
sometimes translated by grandeur, the superlative, the akme. It is the
highest point that can be reached, the infinite and the true.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[123:2](sbe01158.htm#fr_323.md) This phrase
reminds one of the last verse in the No sad âsîd hymn, where, likewise,
the expression of the highest certainty is followed by a misgiving that
after all it may be otherwise. The commentator takes yadi vâ in the
sense of, if you ask in the highest sense, then I say no; for the
Infinite cannot rest in anything, not even in greatness.
