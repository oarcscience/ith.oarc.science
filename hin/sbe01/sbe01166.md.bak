### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Now those arteries of the heart consist of a brown substance, of a
white, blue, yellow, and red

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

substance, and so is the sun brown, white, blue, yellow, and red.

2\. As a very long highway goes to two places, to one at the beginning,
and to another at the end, so do the rays of the sun go to both worlds,
to this one and to the other. They start from the sun, and enter into
those arteries; they start from those arteries, and enter into the sun.

3\. And when a man is asleep, reposing, and at perfect rest, so that he
sees no dream <span id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_338.md), then he has entered
into those arteries. Then no evil touches him, for he has obtained the
light (of the sun).

4\. And when a man falls ill, then those who sit round him, say, 'Do you
know me? Do you know me?' As long as he has not departed from this body,
he knows them.

5\. But when he departs from this body, then he departs upwards by those
very rays (towards the worlds which he has gained by merit, not by
knowledge); or he goes out while meditating on Om <span
id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_339.md) (and thus securing an entrance into the
Brahmaloka).

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

And while his mind is failing, he is going to the sun. For the sun is
the door of the world (of Brahman). Those who know, walk in; those who
do not know, are shut out. There is this verse <span
id="fr_342"></span>[1](sbe01167.htm#fn_340.md): 'There are a hundred and
one arteries of the heart; one of them penetrates the crown of the head;
moving upwards by it a man reaches the immortal; the others serve for
departing in different directions, yea, in different directions <span
id="fr_343"></span>[2](sbe01167.htm#fn_341.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_338"></span>[133:1](sbe01166.htm#fr_340.md) Svapna in Sanskrit
is both somnus and somnium. Hence one might translate also, 'so that he
is not aware that he is asleep,' which in some respects would seem even
more appropriate in our passage; cf. VIII, 11, 1.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[133:2](sbe01166.htm#fr_341.md) According to the
explanation given of the Om in the Upanishads, and more particularly in
the Dahara-vidyâ contained in this Prapâ*th*aka.
