### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. Let a man meditate on the fivefold Sâman <span
id="fr_127"></span>[3](#fn_126) as the five worlds. The hiṅkâra is, the
earth, the prastâva the fire, the udgîtha the sky, the pratihâra the
sun, the nidhana heaven; so in an ascending line.

2\. In a descending line, the hiṅkâra is heaven,

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

the prastâva the sun, the udgîtha the sky, the pratihâra the fire, the
nidhana the earth.

3\. The worlds in an ascending and in a descending line belong to him
who knowing this meditates on the fivefold Sâman as the worlds <span
id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_127).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_126"></span>[23:3](sbe01036.htm#fr_127) The five forms in
which the Sâman is used for sacrificial purposes. The Sâman is always to
be under-stood as the Good, as Dharma, and as Brahman.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[24:1](sbe01036.htm#fr_128) The commentator
supplies some fanciful reasons why each of the five Sâmans is identified
with certain objects. Earth is said to be the hiṅkâra, because both
always come first. Agni is prastâva, because sacrifices are praised in
the fire (prastûyante). The sky is udgîtha, because it is also called
gagana, and both words have the letter g in common. The sun is
pratihâra, because everybody wishes the sun to come towards him (prati).
Heaven is nidhana, because those who depart from here are placed there
(nidhîyante), &c.
