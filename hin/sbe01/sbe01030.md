their rise from the ether, and return into the ether. Ether is older
than these, ether is their rest.

2\. He is indeed the udgîtha (Om = Brahman), greater than great
(parovarîyas), he is without end.

He who knowing this meditates on the udgîtha, the greater than great,
obtains what is greater than great, he conquers the worlds which are
greater than great.

3\. Atidhanvan *S*aunaka, having taught this udgîtha to
Udara-sâ*nd*ilya, said: 'As long as they will know in your family this
udgîtha, their life in this world will be greater than great.

4\. 'And thus also will be their state in the other world.' He who thus
knows the udgîtha, and meditates on it thus, his life in this world will
be greater than great, and also his state in the other world, yea, in
the other world.
