### FIFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The udgîtha is the pra*n*ava <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_92.md),
the pra*n*ava is the udgîtha. And as the udgîtha is the sun <span
id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_93), So is the pra*n*ava, for he (the sun.md)
goes sounding Om.

2\. 'Him I sang praises to, therefore art thou my only one,' thus said
Kaushîtaki to his son. 'Do thou revolve his rays, then thou wilt have
many sons.' So much in reference to the Devas.

3\. Now with reference to the body. Let a man meditate on the udgîtha as
the breath (in the mouth), for he goes sounding Om <span
id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_94.md).

4\. 'Him I sang praises to, therefore art thou my only son,' thus said
Kaushîtaki to his son. 'Do thou therefore sing praises to the breath as
manifold, if thou wishest to have many sons.'

5\. He who knows that the udgîtha is the pra*n*ava, and the pra*n*ava
the udgîtha, rectifies from the seat of the Hot*ri* priest any mistake
committed by the Udgât*ri* priest in performing the udgîtha, yea, in
performing the udgîtha.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_92"></span>[12:1](sbe01026.htm#fr_93.md) Pranava is the name
used chiefly by the followers of the Rig-veda, udgîtha the name used by
the followers of the Sâma-veda. Both words are intended for the syllable
Om.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[12:2](sbe01026.htm#fr_94.md) Cf. *Kh*. Up. I, 3,
1.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[12:3](sbe01026.htm#fr_95.md) The breath in the
mouth, or the chief breath, says Om, i. e. gives permission to the five
senses to act, just as the sun, by saying Om, gives permission to all
living beings to move about.
