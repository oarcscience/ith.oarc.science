## POSITION OF THE UPANISHADS IN VEDIC LITERATURE.

If now we ask what has been thought of the Upanishads by Sanskrit
scholars or by Oriental scholars in general, it must be confessed that
hitherto they have not received at their hands that treatment which in
the eyes of philosophers and theologians they seem so fully to deserve.
When the first enthusiasm for such works as *S*akuntalâ and Gîta-Govinda
had somewhat subsided, and Sanskrit scholars had recognised that a truly
scholarlike study of Indian literature must begin with the beginning,
the exclusively historical interest prevailed to so large an extent that
the hymns of the Veda, the Brâhma*n*as, and the Sûtras absorbed all
interest, while the Upanishads were put aside for a time as of doubtful
antiquity, and therefore of minor importance.

My real love for Sanskrit literature was first kindled by the
Upanishads. It was in the year 1844, when attending Schelling's lectures
at Berlin, that my attention was drawn to those ancient theosophic
treatises, and I still possess my collations of the Sanskrit MSS. which
had then just arrived at Berlin, the Chambers collection, and my copies
of commentaries, and commentaries on commentaries, which I made at that
time. Some of my translations which I left with Schelling, I have never
been able to recover, though to judge from others which I still possess,
the loss of them is of small consequence. Soon after leaving Berlin,
when continuing my Sanskrit studies at Paris under Burnouf, I put aside
the Upanishads, convinced that for a true appreciation of them it was
necessary to study, first of all, the earlier periods of Vedic
literature, as represented by the hymns and the Brâhma*n*as of the
Vedas.

In returning, after more than thirty years, to these favourite studies,
I find that my interest in them, though it has changed in character, has
by no means diminished.

<span id="page_lxvi">p. lxvi</span>

It is true, no doubt, that the stratum of literature which contains the
Upanishads is later than the Sa*m*hitâs, and later than the Brâhma*n*as,
but the first germs of Upanishad doctrines go back at least as far as
the Mantra period, which provisionally has been fixed between 1000 and
800 B.C. Conceptions corresponding to the general teaching of the
Upanishads occur in certain hymns of the Rig-veda-sa*m*hitâ, they must
have existed therefore before that collection was finally closed. One
hymn in the Sa*m*hitâ of the Rig-veda (I, 191) was designated by
Kâtyâyana, the author of the Sarvânukrama*n*ikâ, as an Upanishad. Here,
however, upanishad means rather a secret charm than a philosophical
doctrine. Verses of the hymns have often been incorporated in the
Upanishads, and among the Oupnekhats translated into Persian by Dârâ
Shukoh we actually find the Purusha-sûkta, the 90th hymn of the tenth
book of the Rig-veda <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md), forming the
greater portion of the Bark'heh Soukt. In the Sa*m*hitâ of the
Ya*g*ur-veda, however, in the Vâ*g*asaneyi*s*âkhâ, we meet with a real
Upanishad, the famous Î*s*â or Î*s*âvâsya-upanishad, while the
Sivasa*m*kalpa, too, forms part of its thirty-fourth book <span
id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md). In the Brâhma*n*as several Upanishads
occur, even in portions which are not classed as Âra*n*yakas, as, for
instance, the well-known Kena or Talavakâra upanishad. The recognised
place, however, for the ancient Upanishads is in the Âra*n*yakas, or
forest-books, which, as a rule, form an appendix to the Brâhma*n*as, but
are sometimes included also under the general name of Brâhma*n*a.
Brâhma*n*a, in fact, meaning originally the sayings of Brahmans, whether
in the general sense of priests, or in the more special of
Brahman-priest, is a name applicable not only to the books, properly so
called, but to all old prose traditions, whether contained in the
Sa*m*hitâs, such as the Taittirîya-sa*m*hitâ, the Brâhma*n*as, the
Âra*n*yakas, the Upanishads, and even, in certain cases, in the Sûtras.
We shall see in the introduction to the Aitareya-âra*n*yaka, that that
Âra*n*yaka is in the beginning

<span id="page_lxvii">p. lxvii</span>

a Brâhma*n*a, a mere continuation of the Aitareya-brâhma*n*a, explaining
the Mahâvrata ceremony, while its last book contains the Sûtras or short
technical rules explaining the same ceremony which in the first book had
been treated in the style peculiar to the Brâhma*n*as. In the same
Aitareya-âra*n*yaka, III, 2, 6, 6, a passage of the Upanishad is spoken
of as a Brâhma*n*a, possibly as something like a Brâhma*n*a, while
something very like an Upanishad occurs in the Âpastamba-sûtras, and
might be quoted therefore as a Sûtra <span
id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md). At all events the Upanishads, like the
Âra*n*yakas, belong to what Hindu theologians call Sruti, or revealed
literature, in opposition to Sm*ri*ti, or traditional literature, which
is supposed to be founded on the former, and allowed to claim a
secondary authority only; and the earliest of these philosophical
treatises will always, I believe, maintain a place in the literature of
the world, among the most astounding productions of the human mind in
any age and in any country.
