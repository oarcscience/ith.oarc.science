### FIFTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Brahmâ (Hira*n*yagarbha or Parame*s*vara) told this to Pra*g*âpati
(Ka*s*yapa), Pra*g*âpati to Manu (his son), Manu to mankind. He who has
learnt the Veda from a family of teachers, according to the sacred rule,
in the leisure time left from the duties to be performed for the Guru,
who, after receiving his discharge, has settled in his own house,
keeping up the memory of what he has learnt by repeating it regularly in
some sacred spot, who has begotten virtuous sons, and concentrated all
his senses on the Self, never giving pain to any creature, except at the
tîrthas <span id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_364) (sacrifices, &c..md), he who
behaves thus all his life, reaches the world of Brahman, and does not
return, yea, he does not return.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_364"></span>[144:1](sbe01175.htm#fr_366.md) The commentator
says that even travelling about as a mendicant causes pain, but that a
mendicant is allowed to importune people for alms at tîrthas, or sacred
places. Others explain this differently.
