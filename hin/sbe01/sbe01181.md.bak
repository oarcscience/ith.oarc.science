### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. He who desires proper food <span id="fr_384"></span>[1](#fn_382.md)
should use the hymn, agnim naro dîdhitibhi*h* (Rv. VII, 1, 1) <span
id="fr_385"></span>[2](#fn_383.md).

2\. Verily, Agni (fire) is the eater of food.

In the other (recitations accompanying the) offerings of â*g*ya (where
Agni is likewise mentioned) the worshippers come more slowly near to
Agni (because the name of Agni does not stand at the beginning of the
hymn). But here a worshipper obtains proper food at once, he strikes
down evil at once.

3\. Through the words (occurring in the second foot of the first verse),
hasta*k*yuti *g*anayanta, 'they caused the birth of Agni by moving their
arms,' the hymn becomes endowed with (the word) birth. Verily, the
sacrificer is born from this day of the sacrifice, and therefore the
hymn is endowed with (the word) birth.

4\. There are four metrical feet (in the Trish*t*ubh verses of this
hymn). Verily, cattle have four feet, therefore they serve for the
gaining of cattle.

5\. There are three metrical feet (in the Virâ*g*, verses of this hymn).
Verily, three are these three-fold

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

worlds. Therefore they serve for the conquest of the worlds.

6\. These (the Trish*t*ubh and Virâ*g* verses of the hymn) form two
metres, which form a support (pratish*th*â). Verily, man is supported by
two (feet), cattle by four feet. Therefore this hymn places the
sacrificer who stands on two feet among cattle which stand on four.

7\. By saying them straight on there are twenty-five verses in this
hymn. Man also consists of twenty-five. There are ten fingers on his
hands, ten toes on his feet, two legs, two arms, and the trunk (âtman)
the twenty-fifth. He adorns that trunk, the twenty-fifth, by this hymn.

8\. And then this day (of the sacrifice) consists of twenty-five, and
the Stoma hymn of that day consists of twenty-five <span
id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_384) (verses.md); it becomes the same through
the same. Therefore these two, the day and the hymn, are
twenty-five <span id="fr_387"></span>[2](#fn_385.md).

9\. These twenty-five verses, by repeating the first thrice and the last
thrice, become thirty less one. This is a Virâ*g*, verse (consisting of
thirty syllables), too small by one. Into the small (heart) the vital
spirits are placed, into the small stomach food is placed <span
id="fr_388"></span>[3](#fn_386.md), therefore this Virâ*g*, small by one,
serves for the obtainment of those desires.

10\. He who knows this, obtains those desires.

11\. The verses (contained in the hymn agnim naro dîdhitibhi*h*) become
the B*ri*hatî <span id="fr_389"></span>[4](#fn_387.md) metre and

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

the Virâ*g* metre, (they become) the perfection which belongs to that
day (the mahâvrata). Then they also become Anush*t*ubh <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_388), for the offerings of â*g*ya (ghee.md)
dwell in Anush*t*ubhs <span id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_389.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_382"></span>[159:1](sbe01181.htm#fr_384.md) Annâdyam is always
explained as food, here as annam tad âdya*m* *k*a. It must be so
translated here and elsewhere (1, 2, 10), though it is often an abstract
of annâda, an eater of food, a healthy man.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[159:2](sbe01181.htm#fr_385.md) This hymn is
prescribed in the Vi*s*va*g*it sacrifice, and taken over to the
Mahâvrata, according to rule. It is used, however, both as obligatory
and as optional at the same time, i. e. it is an essential part of the
sacrifice, and at the same time to be used by those who wish for proper
food.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[160:1](sbe01181.htm#fr_386.md) Cf. Ait. Âr. I, 1,
4, 21; II, 3, 4, 2.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[160:2](sbe01181.htm#fr_387.md) The plural after
the dual is explained by the fact that the hymn means the twenty-five
verses.

<span id="fn_386"></span>[160:3](sbe01181.htm#fr_388.md) Cf. I, 3, 7, 5.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[160:4](sbe01181.htm#fr_389.md) The hymn consists
of eighteen Virâ*g* and seven Trish*t*ubh <span id="page_161">p.
161</span> verses. Therefore the eighteen Virâ*g* verses remain what
they are, only that the first is repeated three times, so that we have
twenty Virâ*g* verses. The seven Trish*t*ubhs, by repeating the last
three times, become nine. We then take eight syllables away from each
verse, thus changing them into nine B*ri*hatî verses. The nine times
eight syllables, which were taken off, give us seventy-two syllables,
and as each B*ri*hatî consists of thirty-six syllables, two B*ri*hatîs.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[161:1](sbe01181.htm#fr_390.md) The change of the
first verse, which is a Virâ*g* of thirty-three syllables, into an
Anush*t*ubh is produced by a still easier process. The first Virâ*g*
consists here of thirty-three syllables, the Anush*t*ubh should have
thirty-two. But one or two syllables more or less does not destroy a
metre, according to the views of native metricians. The Virâ*g* itself,
for instance, should have thirty syllables, and here has thirty-three.
Therefore if changed into an Anush*t*ubh, it simply has one syllable
over, which is of no consequence. Comm.

<span id="fn_389"></span>[161:2](sbe01181.htm#fr_391.md) Cf. Ait. Âr. I, 1,
1, 4.
