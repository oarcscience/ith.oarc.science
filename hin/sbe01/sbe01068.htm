<p>1. On the fifth of these nectars the S&acirc;dhyas live, with Brahman at their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the nectar.</p>  
<p>2. They enter into that colour, and they rise from that colour.</p>  
<p>3. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the S&acirc;dhyas, with Brahman at their head; he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour, rises again from that colour.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_166"></A><A HREF="sbe01068.htm#fr_167">43:1</A> The meaning of the five Khandas from 6 to 10 is clear, in so far as they are intended to show that he who knows or meditates on the sacrifices as described before, enjoys his reward in different worlds with the Vasus, Rudras, &amp;c. for certain periods of time, till at last he reaches the true Brahman. Of these periods each succeeding one is supposed to be double the length of the preceding one. This is expressed by imagining a migration of the sun from east to south, west, north, and zenith. Each change of the sun marks a new world, and the duration of each successive world is computed as double the duration of the preceding world. Similar ideas have been more fully developed in the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as, and the commentator is at great pains to remove apparent contradictions between the Paur&acirc;<I>n</I>ik and Vaidik accounts, following, as &Acirc;nanda<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;nagiri remarks, the Dravi<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya (p. 173, l. 13).</P>
