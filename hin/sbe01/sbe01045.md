breath. That is the Gâyatra Sâman, as interwoven in the (five)
prâ*n*as <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_140).

2\. He who thus knows this Gâyatra interwoven in the prâ*n*as, keeps his
senses, reaches the full life, he lives long <span
id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_141), becomes great with children and cattle,
great by fame. The rule of him who thus meditates on the Gâyatra is, 'Be
not high-minded.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_139"></span>[28:3](sbe01045.htm#fr_140) After having
explained the secret meaning of the whole Sâma-veda <span
id="page_29">p. 29</span> ceremonial, as it is to be understood by
meditation only (dhyâna),he proceeds to explain the secret meaning of
the same ceremonial, giving to each its proper name in proper succession
(gâyatra, rathantara, &c.), and showing the hidden purport of those
names.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[29:1](sbe01045.htm#fr_141) Cf. *Kh*. Up. II,
7, 1, where prâ*n*a is explained differently. The Gâyatrî itself is
sometimes called prâ*n*a.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[29:2](sbe01045.htm#fr_142) The commentator
generally takes *g*yok in the sense of bright.
