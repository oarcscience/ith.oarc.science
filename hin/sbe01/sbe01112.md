*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### EIGHTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Then he said to them all: 'You eat your food, knowing that
Vai*s*vânara Self as if it were many. But he who worships the
Vai*s*vânara Self as a span long, and as <span
id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_264.md) identical with himself, he eats food in
all worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

2\. 'Of that Vai*s*vânara Self the head is Sute*g*as (having good
light), the eye Vi*s*varûpa (multiform), the breath P*ri*thagvartman
(having various courses), the trunk Bahula (full), the bladder Rayi
(wealth), the feet the earth, the chest the altar, the hairs the grass
on the altar, the heart the Gârhapatya fire, the mind the Anvâhârya
fire, the mouth the Âhavanîya fire.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_264"></span>[88:1](sbe01112.htm#fr_265.md) The two words
prâde*s*amâtra and abhivimâna are doubtful. The commentator explains the
first in different ways, which are all more or less fanciful. He is
measured or known (mâtra) as Self, <span id="page_89">p. 89</span> by
means of heaven as his head and the earth as his feet, these being the
prâde*s*as; or, in the mouth and the rest, which are instruments, he is
known as without action himself; or, he has the length from heaven to
earth, heaven and earth being called prâde*s*a, because they are taught.
The interpretation, supported by the *G*âbâla*s*ruti, that prâde*s*a is
the measure from the forehead to the chin, he rejects. Abhivimâna is
taken in the same meaning as abhimâna in the Vedânta, seeing everything
in oneself. Vai*s*vânara is taken as the real Self of all beings, and,
in the end, of all Selfs, and as thus to be known and worshipped.
