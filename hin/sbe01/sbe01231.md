### FIFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Now those who repeat the Nirbhuga say:

2\. 'The former half <span id="fr_646"></span>[1](#fn_644.md) is the first
syllable, the latter half the second syllable, and the space between the
first and second halves is the Sa*m*hitâ (union).'

3\. He who thus knows this Sa*m*hitâ (union), becomes united with
offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga.
He lives his full age.

4\. Now Hrasva Mâ*nd*ûkeya says: 'We reciters of Nirbhuga say, "Yes, the
former half is the first syllable, and the latter half the second
syllable, but the Sa*m*hitâ is the space between the first and second
halves in so far as by it one turns out the union (sandhi), and knows
what is the accent and what is not <span
id="fr_647"></span>[2](#fn_645.md), and distinguishes what is the mora and
what is not."'

5\. He who thus knows this Sa*m*hitâ (union), becomes united with
offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga.
He lives his full age.

6\. Now his middle son, the child of his mother Prâtibodhî <span
id="fr_648"></span>[3](#fn_646.md), says: 'One pronounces these two
syllables letter by letter, without entirely separating

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

them, and without entirely uniting them <span
id="fr_649"></span>[1](#fn_647.md). Then that mora between the first and
second halves, which indicates the union, that is the Sâman (evenness,
sliding). I therefore hold Sâman only to be the Sa*m*hitâ (union).

7\. This has also been declared by a *Ri*shi (Rv. II, 23, 16):--

8\. 'O B*ri*haspati, they know nothing higher than Sâman.'

9\. He who thus knows this Sa*m*hitâ (union), becomes united with
offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga.
He lives his full age.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_644"></span>[253:1](sbe01231.htm#fr_646.md) As spoken of
before, III, 1, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[253:2](sbe01231.htm#fr_647.md) In agnim î*l*e,
î*l*e by itself has no accent, but as joined by sandhi with agnim, its
first syllable becomes svarita, its second pra*k*ita. In tava it, the
vowel i is a short mora or mâtrâ; but if joined with va, it vanishes,
and becomes long e, tavet. Comm.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[253:3](sbe01231.htm#fr_648.md) Prâtîbodhîputra,
the son of Prâtîbodhî, she being probably one out of several wives of
Hrasva. Another instance of this metronymic nomenclature occurred in
K*ri*sh*n*a Devakîputra, *Kh*. Up. III, 7, 6. The Kashmir MS. reads
Prâ*k*îbodhî, but Pratibodha is a recognised name in Ga*n*a Vidâdi, and
the right reading is probably Prâtibodhî. The same MS. leaves out putra
âha.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[254:1](sbe01231.htm#fr_649.md) So that the ê in
tavet should neither be one letter e, nor two letters a + i, but
something between the two, enabling us to hear a + i in the
pronunciation of ê.
