### THIRD KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_420"></span>[3](#fn_418.md).

1\. They say: 'What is the meaning of preṅkha, swing?' Verily, he is the
swing, who blows (the wind). He indeed goes forward (pra + iṅkhate) in
these worlds, and that is why the swing is called preṅkha.

2\. Some say, that there should be one plank, because the wind blows in
one way, and it should be like the wind.

3\. That is not to be regarded.

4\. Some say, there should be three planks, because there are these
three threefold worlds, and it should be like them.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

5\. That is not to be regarded.

6\. Let there be two, for these two worlds (the earth and heaven) are
seen as if most real, while the ether (space) between the two is the sky
(antariksha). Therefore let there be two planks.

7\. Let them be made of Udumbara wood. Verily, the Udumbara tree is sap
and eatable food, and thus it serves to obtain sap and eatable food.

8\. Let them be elevated in the middle (between the earth and the
cross-beam). Food, if placed in the middle, delights man, and thus he
places the sacrificer in the middle of eatable food.

9\. There are two kinds of rope, twisted towards the right and twisted
towards the left. The right ropes serve for some animals, the left ropes
for others. If there are both kinds of rope, they serve for the
attainment of both kinds of cattle.

10\. Let them be made of Darbha (Ku*s*a grass), for among plants Darbha
is free from evil, therefore they should be made of Darbha grass.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_418"></span>[172:3](sbe01186.htm#fr_420.md) After having
considered the Marutvatîya, he proceeds to consider the Nishkevalya.
This has to be recited by the Hot*ri* while sitting on a swing.
