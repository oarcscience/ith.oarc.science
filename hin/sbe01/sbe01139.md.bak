### FIFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Consideration (*k*itta) <span id="fr_308"></span>[2](#fn_306.md) is
better than will. For when a man considers, then he wills, then he
thinks in his mind, then he sends forth speech, and he

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

sends it forth in a name. In a name the sacred hymns are contained, in
the sacred hymns all sacrifices.

2\. 'All these (beginning with mind and ending in sacrifice) centre in
consideration, consist of consideration, abide in consideration.
Therefore if a man is inconsiderate, even if he possesses much learning,
people say of him, he is nothing, whatever he may know; for, if he were
learned, he would not be so inconsiderate. But if a man is considerate,
even though he knows but little, to him indeed do people listen gladly.
Consideration is the centre, consideration is the self, consideration is
the support of all these. Meditate on consideration.

3\. 'He who meditates on consideration as Brahman, he, being himself
safe, firm, and undistressed, obtains the safe, firm, and undistressed
worlds which he has considered; he is, as it were, lord and master as
far as consideration reaches--he who meditates on consideration as
Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than consideration?'

'Yes, there is something better than consideration.'

'Sir, tell it me.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_305"></span>[113:1](sbe01138.htm#fr_307.md) This paragraph is
obscure. The text seems doubtful, for instance, in samak*li*patâm,
samakalpetâm, and samakalpatâm. Then the question is the exact meaning
of sa*m*k*li*ptyai, which must be taken as an instrumental case. What is
intended is that, without rain, food is impossible &c. or inconceivable;
but the text says, 'By the will of rain food wills,' &c. Will seems
almost to be taken here in the sense in which modern philosophers use
it, as a kind of creative will. By the will of rain food wills, would
mean, that first rain wills and exists, and afterwards the vital airs
will and exist, &c.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[113:2](sbe01139.htm#fr_308.md) *K*itta, thought,
implies here consideration and reflection.
