### THIRTEENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_175).

1\. For that heart there are five gates belonging to the Devas (the
senses). The eastern gate is the Prâ*n*a (up-breathing), that is the
eye, that is Âditya (the sun). Let a man meditate on that as brightness
(glory of countenance) and health. He who knows this, becomes bright and
healthy.

2\. The southern gate is the Vyâna (back-breathing), that is the ear,
that is the moon. Let a man meditate on that as happiness and fame. He
who knows this, becomes happy and famous.

3\. The western gate is the Apâna (down-breathing), that is speech, that
is Agni (fire). Let a man meditate on that as glory of countenance and
health. He who knows this, becomes glorious and healthy.

4\. The northern gate is the Samâna (on-breathing), that is mind, that
is Par*g*anya (rain). Let a man meditate on that as celebrity and
beauty.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He who knows this,
becomes celebrated and beautiful.

5\. The upper gate is the Udâna (out-breathing), that is air, that is
ether. Let a man meditate on that as strength and greatness. He who
knows this, becomes strong and great.

6\. These are the five men of Brahman, the doorkeepers of the Svarga
(heaven) world. He who knows these five men of Brahman, the door-keepers
of the Svarga world, in his family a strong son is born. He who thus
knows these five men of Brahman, as the door-keepers of the Svarga
world, enters himself the Svarga world.

7\. Now that light which shines above this heaven, higher than all,
higher than everything, in the highest world, beyond which there are no
other worlds, that is the same light which is within man. And of this we
have this visible proof <span id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_176):

8\. Namely, when we thus perceive by touch the warmth here in the
body <span id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_177). And of it we have this
audible proof: Namely, when we thus, after stopping our ears, listen to
what is like the rolling of a carriage, or the bellowing of an ox, or
the sound of a burning fire <span id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_178)
(within the ears). Let a man meditate on this as the (Brahman) which is
seen and heard.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He, who knows
this, becomes conspicuous and celebrated, yea, he becomes celebrated.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_175"></span>[46:1](sbe01071.htm#fr_176) The meditation on
the five gates and the five gate-keepers of the heart is meant to be
subservient to the meditation on Brahman, as the ether in the heart,
which, as it is said at the end, is actually seen and heard by the
senses as being within the heart.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[47:1](sbe01071.htm#fr_177) The presence of
Brahman in the heart of man is not to rest on the testimony of
revelation only, but is here to be established by the evidence of the
senses. Childish as the argument may seem to us, it shows at all events
how intently the old Brahmans thought on the problem of the evidence of
the invisible.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[47:2](sbe01071.htm#fr_178) That warmth must
come from something, just as smoke comes from fire, and this something
is supposed to be Brahman in the heart.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[47:3](sbe01071.htm#fr_179) Cf. Ait. Âr. III,
2, 4, 11-13.
