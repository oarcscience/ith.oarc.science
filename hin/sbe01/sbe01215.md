### SECOND KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_551.md).

1\. He who knows the gradual development of the self in him (the man
conceived as the uktha), obtains himself more development.

2\. There are herbs and trees and all that is animated, and he knows the
self gradually developing in them. For in herbs and trees sap only is
seen <span id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_552), but thought (*k*itta.md) in
animated beings.

Among animated beings again the self develops gradually, for in some sap
(blood) is seen (as well as thought), but in others thought is not seen.

4\. And in man again the self develops gradually, for he is most endowed
with knowledge. He says what he has known, he sees what he has
known <span id="fr_555"></span>[3](#fn_553.md). He knows what is to happen
to-morrow, he knows heaven and hell. By means of the mortal he desires
the immortal--thus is he endowed.

5\. With regard to the other animals hunger and thirst only are a kind
of understanding. But they do not say what they have known, nor do they
see

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

what they have known. They do not know what is to happen to-morrow, nor
heaven and hell. They go so far and no further, for they are born
according to their knowledge (in a former life).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_551"></span>[222:1](sbe01215.htm#fr_553.md) This treats of the
gradual development of life in man, particularly of the development of a
thinking soul (*k*aitanya).

<span id="fn_552"></span>[222:2](sbe01215.htm#fr_554.md) In stones there is
not even sap, but only being, sattâ. Comm.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[222:3](sbe01215.htm#fr_555.md) What he has known
yesterday he remembers, and is able to say before men, I know this. And
when he has known a thing he remembers it, and goes to the same place to
see it again. Comm.
