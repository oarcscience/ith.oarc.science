### NINTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. But Indra, before he had returned to the Devas, saw this difficulty.
As this self (the shadow in the water) <span
id="fr_350"></span>[2](#fn_348.md) is well adorned, when the body is well
adorned, well dressed, when the body is well dressed, well cleaned, if
the body is well cleaned, that self will also be blind, if the body is

the body perishes. Therefore I see no good in this (doctrine).

crippled, and will perish in fact as soon as the body perishes.

remarks that though both Indra and Viro*k*ana had mistaken the true

be the Self, Indra thought that the Self was the shadow of the body.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[137:3](sbe01169.htm#fr_351.md) Srâma, lame, is
explained by the commentator as one-eyed, ekanetra.
