## FOURTH PRAPÂ*TH*AKA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_195"></span>[2](#fn_194.md).

1\. There lived once upon a time *G*âna*s*ruti Pautrâya*n*a (the
great-grandson of *G*ana*s*ruta), who was a pious giver, bestowing much
wealth upon the

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

people, and always keeping open house. He built places of refuge
everywhere, wishing that people should everywhere eat of his food.

2\. Once in the night some Ha*m*sas (flamingoes) flew over his house,
and one flamingo said to another: 'Hey, Bhallâksha, Bhallâksha
(short-sighted friend). The light (glory) of *G*âna*s*ruti Pautrâya*n*a
has spread like the sky. Do not go near, that it may not burn thee.'

3\. The other answered him: 'How can you speak of him, being what he is
(a râ*g*anya, noble), as if he were like Raikva with the car <span
id="fr_196"></span>[1](#fn_195.md)?'

4\. The first replied: 'How is it with this Raikva with the car of whom
thou speakest?'

The other answered: 'As (in a game of dice) all the lower casts <span
id="fr_197"></span>[2](#fn_196.md) belong to him who has conquered with the
K*ri*ta cast, so whatever good deeds other people perform, belong to
that Raikva. He who knows what he knows, he is thus spoken of by me.'

5\. *G*âna*s*ruti Pautrâya*n*a overheard this conversation, and as soon
as he had risen in the morning, he said to his. door-keeper
(kshatt*ri*): 'Friend, dost thou speak of (me, as if I were) Raikva with
the car?'

He replied: 'How is it with this Raikva, with the car?'

6\. The king said: 'As (in a game of dice), all the lower casts belong
to him who has conquered with the K*ri*ta cast, so whatever good deeds
other people perform, belong to that Raikva. He who knows what he knows,
he is thus spoken of by me.'

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

7\. The door-keeper went to look for Raikva, but returned saying, 'I
found him not.' Then the king said: 'Alas! where a Brâhma*n*a should be
searched for (in the solitude of the forest), there go for him.'

8\. The door-keeper came to a man who was lying beneath a car and
scratching his sores <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_197.md). He addressed
him, and said: 'Sir, are you Raikva with the car? '

He answered: 'Here I am.'

Then the door-keeper returned, and said: 'I have found him.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_194"></span>[55:2](sbe01078.htm#fr_195) Vâyu (air.md) and
Prâ*n*a (breath) had before been represented as feet of Brahman, as the
second pair. Now they are represented as Brahman, and as to be meditated
on as such. This is the teaching of Raikva. The language of this chapter
is very obscure, and I am not satisfied with the translation.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[56:1](sbe01078.htm#fr_196.md) Sayugvan is
explained as possessed of a car with yoked horses or oxen. Could it have
meant originally, 'yoke-fellow, equal,' as in Rig-veda X, 130, 4?
Anquetil renders it by 'semper cum se ipso camelum solutum habens.'

<span id="fn_196"></span>[56:2](sbe01078.htm#fr_197.md) Instead of
adhareyâ*h*, we must read adhare 'yâ*h*.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[57:1](sbe01078.htm#fr_198.md) It is curious that
in a hymn of the Atharva-veda (V, 22, 5, 8) takman, apparently a disease
of the skin, is relegated to the Mahâv*ri*shas, where Raikva dwelt.
