### ELEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Fire (te*g*as) is better than water. For fire united with air,

thus again thunderclaps come with lightnings, flashing upwards and
across the sky. Then people say, There is lightning and thunder, it will
rain. Then also does fire, after showing this sign first, create water.
Meditate on fire.

2\. 'He who meditates on fire as Brahman, obtains, resplendent himself,
resplendent worlds, full of light and free of darkness; he is, as it
were, lord and master as far as fire reaches--he who meditates on fire
as Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than fire?'

'Yes, there is something better than fire.'

'Sir, tell it me.'
