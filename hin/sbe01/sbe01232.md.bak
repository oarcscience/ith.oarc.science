*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Târukshya <span id="fr_650"></span>[2](#fn_648.md) said: 'The Sa*m*hitâ
(union) is formed by means of the B*ri*hat and Rathantara <span
id="fr_651"></span>[3](#fn_649.md) Sâmans.'

2\. Verily, the Rathantara Sâman is speech, the B*ri*hat Sâman is
breath. By both, by speech and breath, the Sa*m*hitâ is formed <span
id="fr_652"></span>[4](#fn_650.md).

3\. For this Upanishad (for acquiring from his teacher the knowledge of
this Sa*m*hitâ of speech and breath) Târukshya guards (his teacher's)
cows a whole year.

4\. For it alone Târukshya guards the cows a whole year.

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

5\. This has also been declared by a *Ri*shi (Rv. X, 181, 1; and Rv. X,
181, 2):--

6\. 'Vasish*th*a carried hither the Rathantara; 'Bharadvâga brought
hither the B*ri*hat of Agni.'

7\. He who thus knows this Sa*m*hitâ (union), becomes united with
offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga.
He lives his full age.

8\. Kau*nth*aravya said: 'Speech is united with breath, breath with the
blowing air, the blowing air with the Vi*s*vedevas, the Vi*s*vedevas
with the heavenly world, the heavenly world with Brahman. That Sa*m*hitâ
is called the gradual Sa*m*hitâ.'

9\. He who knows this gradual Sa*m*hitâ (union), becomes united with
offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga,
in exactly the same manner as this Sa*m*hitâ, i.e. gradually.

10\. If that worshipper, whether for his own sake or for that of
another, recites (the Sa*m*hitâ), let him know when he is going to
recite, that this Sa*m*hitâ went up to heaven, and that it will be even
so with those who by knowing it become Devas. May it always be so!

11\. He who thus knows this Sa*m*hitâ (union), becomes united with
offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga.
He lives his full age.

12\. Pañ*k*âla*k*a*nd*a said: 'The Sa*m*hitâ (union, composition) is
speech.'

13\. Verily, by speech the Vedas, by speech the metres are composed.
Friends unite through speech, all beings unite through speech; therefore
speech is everything here <span id="fr_653"></span>[1](#fn_651.md).

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

14\. With regard to this (view of speech being more than breath), it
should be borne in mind that when we thus repeat (the Veda) or speak,
breath is (absorbed) in speech; speech swallows breath. And when we are
silent or sleep, speech is (absorbed) in breath; breath swallows speech.
The two swallow each other. Verily, speech is the mother, breath the
son.

15\. This has been declared also by a *Ri*shi (Rv. X, 114, 4):--

16\. 'There is one bird; (as wind) he has entered the sky; (as breath or
living soul) he saw this whole world. With my ripe mind I saw him close
to me (in the heart); the mother (licks or) absorbs him (breath), and he
absorbs the mother (speech).'

17\. He who thus knows this Sa*m*hitâ (union), becomes united with
offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga.
He lives his full age.

18\. Next follows the Pra*g*âpati-Sa*m*hitâ.

19\. The former half is the wife, the latter half the man; the result of
their union the son; the act of their union the begetting; that
Sa*m*hitâ is Aditi (indestructible).

20\. For Aditi (indestructible) is all this whatever there is, father,
mother, son, and begetting.

21\. This has also been declared by a *Ri*shi (Rv. I, 189, 10)--

22\. 'Aditi is mother, is father, is son.'

23\. He who thus knows this Sa*m*hitâ (union), becomes united with
offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga.
He lives his full age.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_648"></span>[254:2](sbe01232.htm#fr_650.md) The Kashmir MS.
reads Târkshya, a name used before as the title of a hymn (Ait. Âr. I,
5, 2, 8). Here Târakshya seems preferable, see Pâ*n*. IV, 1, 105.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[254:3](sbe01232.htm#fr_651.md) See Ait. Âr. I, 4,
2, 1-4.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[254:4](sbe01232.htm#fr_652.md) These two, the
B*ri*hat and Rathantara, are required for the P*ri*sh*th*astotra in the
Agnish*t*oma, and they are to remind the worshipper that speech and
breath are required for all actions.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[255:1](sbe01232.htm#fr_653.md) Everything can be
obtained by speech in this life and in the next. Comm.
