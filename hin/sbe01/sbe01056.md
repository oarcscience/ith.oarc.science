### TWENTY-SECOND KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_150.md).

1\. The udgîtha, of which a poet said, I choose the deep sounding note
of the Sâman as good for cattle, belongs to Agni; the indefinite note
belongs to Pra*g*âpati, the definite note to Soma, the soft and smooth
note to Vâyu, the smooth and strong note to Indra, the heron-like note
to B*ri*haspati, the dull note to Varu*n*a. Let a man cultivate all of
these, avoiding, however, that of Varu*n*a.

2\. Let a man sing <span id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_151.md), wishing to
obtain by his song immortality for the Devas. 'May I obtain by my song
oblations (svadhâ) for the fathers, hope for men, fodder and water for
animals, heaven for the sacrificer, food for myself,' thus reflecting on
these in his mind, let a man (Udgât*ri* priest) sing praises, without
making mistakes in pronunciation, &c.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

3\. All vowels (svara) belong to Indra, all sibilants (ûshman) to
Pra*g*âpati, all consonants (spar*s*a) to M*ri*tyu (death). If somebody
should reprove him for his vowels, let him say, 'I went to Indra as my
refuge (when pronouncing my vowels): he will answer thee.'

4\. And if somebody should reprove him for his sibilants, let him say,
'I went to Pra*g*âpati as my refuge: he will smash thee.' And if
somebody should reprove him for his consonants, let him say, 'I went to
M*ri*tyu as my refuge: he will reduce thee to ashes.'

5\. All vowels are to be pronounced with voice (ghosha) and strength
(bala), so that the Udgât*ri* may give strength to Indra. All sibilants
are to be pronounced, neither as if swallowed (agrasta) <span
id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_152), nor as if thrown out (nirasta.md) <span
id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_153.md), but well opened <span
id="fr_155"></span>[3](#fn_154) (viv*ri*ta.md), so that the Udgât*ri* may
give himself to Pra*g*âpati. All consonants are to be pronounced slowly,
and without crowding them together <span
id="fr_156"></span>[4](#fn_155.md), so that the Udgât*ri* may withdraw
himself from M*ri*tyu.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_150"></span>[33:2](sbe01056.htm#fr_151.md) These are
lucubrations on the different tones employed in singing the Sâman hymns,
and their names, such as vinardi, anirukta, nirukta, m*ri*du
*s*laksh*n*a, *s*laksh*n*a balavad, krauñ*k*a, apadhvânta.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[33:3](sbe01056.htm#fr_152.md) It would be better
if the first ity âgâyet could be left out. The commentator ignores these
words.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[34:1](sbe01056.htm#fr_153.md) Grâsa, according to
the Rig-veda-prâti*s*âkhya 766, is the stiffening of the root of the
tongue in pronunciation.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[34:2](sbe01056.htm#fr_154.md) Nirâsa, according
to the Rig-veda-prâti*s*âkhya 760, is the withdrawing of the active from
the passive organ in pronunciation.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[34:3](sbe01056.htm#fr_155.md) The opening,
viv*ri*ta, may mean two things, either the opening of the vocal chords
(kha), which imparts to the ûshmans their surd character (Rig. Prât.
709), or the opening of the organs of pronunciation (kara*n*a), which
for the ûshmans is asp*ri*sh*t*am sthitam (Rig. Prât. 719), or viv*ri*ta
(Ath. Prât. I, 31; Taitt. Prât. 5).

<span id="fn_155"></span>[34:4](sbe01056.htm#fr_156.md) Anabhinihita, for
thus the commentaries give the reading, is explained by anabhinikshipta.
On the real abhinidhâna, see Rig. Prât. 393. The translation does not
follow the commentary. The genitive pra*g*âpate*h* is governed by
paridadâni.
