### NINETEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Âditya (the sun <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_191).md) is Brahman,
this is the doctrine, and this is the fuller account of it:--

In the beginning this was non-existent <span
id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_192.md). It became

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

existent, it grew. It turned into an egg <span
id="fr_194"></span>[1](#fn_193.md). The egg lay for the time of a year. The
egg broke open. The two halves were one of silver, the other of gold.

2\. The silver one became this earth, the golden one the sky, the thick
membrane (of the white) the mountains, the thin membrane (of the yoke)
the mist with the clouds, the small veins the rivers, the fluid the sea.

3\. And what was born from it that was Âditya, the sun. When he was born
shouts of hurrah arose, and all beings arose, and all things which they
desired. Therefore whenever the sun rises and sets, shouts of hurrah
arise, and all beings arise, and all things which they desire.

4\. If any one knowing this meditates on the sun as Brahman, pleasant
shouts will approach him and will continue, yea, they will continue.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_191"></span>[54:1](sbe01077.htm#fr_192.md) Âditya, or the sun,
had before been represented as one of the four feet of Brahman. He is
now represented as Brahman, or as to be meditated on as such.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[54:2](sbe01077.htm#fr_193.md) Not yet existing,
not yet developed in form and name, and therefore as if not existing.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[55:1](sbe01077.htm#fr_194.md) Â*nd*a instead of
a*nd*a is explained as a Vedic irregularity. A similar cosmogony is
given in Manu's Law Book, I, 12 seq. See Kellgren, Mythus de ovo
mundano, Helsingfors, 1849.
