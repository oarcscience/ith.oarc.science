### FOURTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_396"></span>[2](#fn_394.md).

1\. Rv. I, 2, 1-3. Vâyav â yâhi dar*s*ateme somâ ara*m* k*ri*tâ*h*,
'Approach, O Vâyu, conspicuous, these Somas have been made ready.'
Because the word ready occurs in these verses, therefore is this day (of
the sacrifice) ready (and auspicious) for the sacrificer and for the
gods.

2\. Yes, this day is ready (and auspicious) to him who knows this, or
for whom a Hot*ri* priest who knows this, recites.

3\. Rv. I, 2, 4-6. Indravâyû ime sutâ, â yâtam upa nishk*ri*tam, 'Indra
and Vâyu, these Somas are prepared, come hither towards what has been
prepared.' By nishk*ri*ta, prepared, he means what has been well
prepared (sa*m*sk*ri*ta).

4\. Indra and Vâyu go to what has been prepared by him who knows this,
or for whom a Hot*ri* priest who knows this, recites.

5\. Rv. I, 2, 7. Mitra*m* huve pûtadaksham, dhiya*m* gh*ri*tâkî*m*
sâdhantâ, 'I call Mitra of holy strength; (he and Varu*n*a) they fulfil
the prayer accompanied with clarified butter.' Verily, speech is the
prayer accompanied with clarified butter.

6\. Speech is given to him who knows this, or for whom a Hot*ri* priest
who knows this, recites.

7\. Rv. I, 3, 1. A*s*vinâ ya*g*varîr isha*h*, 'O A*s*vinau, (eat) the
sacrificial offerings.' Verily, the sacrificial offerings are food, and
this serves for the acquirement of food.

8\. Rv. I, 3, 3. Â yâta*m* rudravartanî, 'Come hither, ye Rudravartanî.'

9\. The Asvinau go to the sacrifice of him who knows this, or for whom a
Hot*ri* priest who knows this, recites.

10\. Rv. I, 3, 4-6. Indrâ yâhi *k*itrabhâno, indrâ yâhi dhiyeshita*h*,
indrâ yâhi tûtu*g*âna, 'Come hither, Indra, of bright splendour, Come
hither, Indra, called by prayer, Come hither, Indra, quickly!' Thus he
recites, Come hither, come hither!

11\. Indra comes to the sacrifice of him who knows this, or for whom a
Hot*ri* priest who knows this, recites.

12\. Rv. I, 3, 7. Omâsa*s* *k*arsha*n*îdh*ri*to vi*s*ve devâsa â gata,
'Vi*s*ve Devas, protectors, supporters of men, come hither!'

13\. Verily, the Vi*s*ve Devas come to the call of him who knows this,
or for whom a Hot*ri* priest who knows this, recites.

14\. Rv. I, 3, 7. Dâsvâ*m*so dâ*s*usha*h* sutam, 'Come ye givers to the
libation of the giver!' By dâ*s*usha*h* he means dadusha*h*, i. e. to
the libation of every one that gives.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

15\. The gods fulfil his wish, with whatever wish he recites this verse,

16\. (The wish of him) who knows this, or for whom a Hot*ri* priest who
knows this, recites.

17\. Rv. I, 3, 10. Pâvakâ na*h* sarasvatî ya*g*ña*m* vash*t*u
dhiyâvasu*h*, 'May the holy Sarasvatî accept our sacrifice, rich in
prayer!' Speech is meant by 'rich in prayer.'

18\. Speech is given to him who knows this, or for whom a Hot*ri* priest
who knows this, recites.

19\. And when he says, 'May she accept our sacrifice!' what he means is,
'May she carry off our sacrifice!'

20\. If these verses are recited straight on, they are twenty-one. Man
also consists of twenty-one. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten
toes on his feet, and the trunk the twenty-first. He adorns that trunk,
the twenty-first, by this hymn <span id="fr_397"></span>[1](#fn_395.md).

21\. By repeating the first and the last verses thrice, they become
twenty-five. The trunk is the twenty-fifth, and Pra*g*âpati is the
twenty-fifth. There are ten fingers on his hands, ten toes on his feet,
two legs, two arms, and the trunk the twenty-fifth. He adorns that
trunk, the twenty-fifth, by this hymn'.

Now this day consists of twenty-five, and the Stoma hymn of that day
consists of twenty-five: it becomes the same through the same. Therefore
these two, the day and the hymn, are twenty-five, yea, twenty-five.
