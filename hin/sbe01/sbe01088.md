Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### ELEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. After that the Gârhapatya fire <span id="fr_214"></span>[4](#fn_213)
taught him Earth, fire, food, and the sun (these are my forms, or

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

forms of Brahman). The person that is seen in the sun, I am he, I am he
indeed <span id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_214).

2\. 'He who knowing this meditates on him, destroys sin, obtains the
world (of Agni Gârhapatya), reaches his full age, and lives long; his
descendants do not perish. We guard him in this world and in the other,
whosoever knowing this meditates on him.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_213"></span>[65:4](sbe01088.htm#fr_214) The household
altar.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[66:1](sbe01088.htm#fr_215) Fanciful
similarities and relations between the fires of the three altars and
their various forms and manifestations are pointed out by the
commentator. Thus earth and food are represented as warmed and boiled by
the fire. The sun is said to give warmth and light like the fire of the
altar. The chief point, however, is that in all of them Brahman is
manifested.
