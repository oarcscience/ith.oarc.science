### TENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Next let a man meditate on the sevenfold Sâman which is uniform in
itself <span id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_137.md) and leads beyond death. The
word hiṅkâra has three syllables, the word prastâva has three syllables:
that is equal (sama).

2\. The word âdi (first, Om) has two syllables, the word pratihâra has
four syllables. Taking one syllable from that over, that is equal
(sama).

3\. The word udgîtha has three syllables, the word upadrava has four
syllables. With three and three syllables it should be equal. One
syllable being left over, it becomes trisyllabic. Hence it is equal.

4\. The word nidhana has three syllables, therefore it is equal. These
make twenty-two syllables.

5\. With twenty-one syllables a man reaches the sun (and death), for the
sun is the twenty-first <span id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_138.md) from here;
with the twenty-second he conquers what is beyond the sun: that is
blessedness, that is freedom from grief

6\. He obtains here the victory over the sun (death), and there is a
higher victory than the victory over the sun for him, who knowing this
meditates on the sevenfold Sâman as uniform in itself, which leads
beyond death, yea, which leads beyond death.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_137"></span>[28:1](sbe01044.htm#fr_138.md) Âtmasammita is
explained by the commentator either as having the same number of
syllables in the names of the different Sâmans, or as equal to the
Highest Self.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[28:2](sbe01044.htm#fr_139.md) There are twelve
months, five seasons, three worlds, then follows the sun as the
twenty-first. Comm.
