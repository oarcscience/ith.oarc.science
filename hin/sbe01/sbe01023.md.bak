### SECOND KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_77.md).

1\. When the Devas and Asuras <span id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_78.md)
struggled together, both of the race of Pra*g*âpati, the Devas took the
udgîtha <span id="fr_79"></span>[3](#fn_79) (Om.md), thinking they would
vanquish the Asuras with it.

2\. They meditated on the udgîtha <span id="fr_80"></span>[3](#fn_79.md)
(Om) as the breath (scent) in the nose <span
id="fr_81"></span>[4](#fn_80), but the Asuras pierced it (the breath.md)
with evil. Therefore we smell by the breath in the nose both what is
good-smelling and what is bad-smelling. For the breath was pierced by
evil.

3\. Then they meditated on the udgîtha (Om) as speech, but the Asuras
pierced it with evil. Therefore we speak both truth and falsehood. For
speech is pierced by evil.

4\. Then they meditated on the udgîtha (Om) as the eye, but the Asuras
pierced it with evil. Therefore

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

we see both what is sightly and unsightly. For the eye is pierced by
evil.

5\. Then they meditated on the udgîtha (Om) as the ear, but the Asuras
pierced it with evil. Therefore we hear both what should be heard and
what should not be heard. For the car is pierced by evil.

6\. Then they meditated on the udgîtha (Om) as the mind, but the Asuras
pierced it with evil. Therefore we conceive both what should be
conceived and what should not be conceived. For the mind is pierced by
evil.

7\. Then comes this breath (of life) in the mouth <span
id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_81). They meditated on the udgîtha (Om.md) as
that breath. When the Asuras came to it, they were scattered, as (a ball
of earth) would be scattered when hitting a solid stone.

8\. Thus, as a ball of earth is scattered when hitting on a solid stone,
will he be scattered who wishes evil to one who knows this, or who
persecutes him; for he is a solid stone.

9\. By it (the breath in the mouth) he distinguishes neither what is
good nor what is bad-smelling, for that breath is free from evil. What
we eat and drink with it supports the other vital breaths (i. e. the
senses, such as smell, &c.) When at the time of death he <span
id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_82.md) does not find that breath (in the

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

mouth, through which he eats and drinks and lives), then he departs. He
opens the mouth at the time of death (as if wishing to eat).

10\. Aṅgiras <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) meditated on the
udgîtha (Om) as that breath, and people hold it to be Aṅgiras, i. e. the
essence of the members (angânâ*m* rasa*h*);

11\. Therefore B*ri*haspati meditated on udgîtha (Om) as that breath,
and people hold it to be B*ri*haspati, for speech is b*ri*hatî, and he
(that breath) is the lord (pati) of speech;

12\. Therefore Ayâsya meditated on the udgîtha (Om) as that breath, and
people hold it to be Ayâsya, because it comes (ayati) from the mouth
(âsya);

13\. Therefore Vaka Dâlbhya knew it. He was the Udgât*ri* (singer) of
the Naimishîya-sacrificers, and by singing he obtained for them their
wishes.

14\. He who knows this, and meditates on the syllable Om (the
imperishable udgîtha) as the breath of life in the mouth, he obtains all
wishes by singing. So much for the udgîtha (Om) as meditated on with
reference to the body <span id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_84.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_77"></span>[4:1](sbe01023.htm#fr_77.md) A very similar story
is told in the B*ri*had-âranyaka I, 1, 3, 1. But though the coincidences
between the two are considerable, amounting sometimes to verbal
identity, the purport of the two seems to be different. See
Vedânta-sûtra III, 3, 6.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[4:2](sbe01023.htm#fr_78.md) Devas and Asuras, gods
and demons, are here explained by the commentator as the good and evil
inclinations of man; Pra*g*âpati as man in general.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[4:3](sbe01023.htm#fr_80.md) Udgîtha stands,
according to the commentator, for the sacrificial act to be performed by
the Udgât*ri*, the Sâma-veda priest, with the udgîtha hymns; and as
these sacrificial acts always form part of the *G*yotish*t*oma &c.,
these great Soma-sacrifices are really intended. In the second place,
however, the commentator takes udgîtha in the sense of Udgât*ri*, the
performer of the udgîtha, which is or was by the Devas thought to be the
breath in the nose. I have preferred to take udgîtha in the sense of Om,
and all that is implied by it.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[4:4](sbe01023.htm#fr_81.md) They asked that breath
should recite the udgîtha. Comm.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[5:1](sbe01023.htm#fr_82.md) Mukhya prâ*n*a is used
in two senses, the principal or vital breath, also called sresh*th*a,
and the breath in the mouth, also called âsanya.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[5:2](sbe01023.htm#fr_83.md) According to the
commentator, the assemblage of the other vital breaths or senses is here
meant. They depart when the breath of the mouth, sometimes called
sarvambhari, all-supporting, does no longer, by eating and drinking,
support them.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[6:1](sbe01023.htm#fr_84.md) The paragraphs from 10
to 14 are differently explained by Indian commentators. By treating the
nominatives aṅgirâs, b*ri*haspatis, and ayâsyas (here the printed text
reads ayâsyam) as accusatives, or by admitting the omission of an iti
after them, they connect paragraphs 9, 10, and 11 with paragraph 12, and
thus gain the meaning that Vaka Dâlbhya meditated on the breath in the
mouth as Aṅgiras, B*ri*haspati, and Ayâsya, instead of those saints
having themselves thus meditated; and that he, knowing the secret names
and qualities of the breath, obtained, when acting as Udgât*ri* priest,
the wishes of those for whom he sacrificed. Tena is difficult to
explain, unless we take it in the sense of tenânu*s*ish*t*ah, taught by
him.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[6:2](sbe01023.htm#fr_85.md) Adhyâtma means with
reference to the body, not with reference to the self or the soul.
Having explained the symbolical <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> meaning of
Om as applied to the body and its organs of sense, he now explains its
symbolical meaning adhidaivatam, i.e. as applied to divine beings.
