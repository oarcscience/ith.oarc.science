### TWENTY-THIRD KHA*ND*A.

1\. There are three branches of the law. Sacrifice, study, and charity
are the first <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_156.md),

2\. Austerity the second, and to dwell as a Brahma*k*ârin in the house
of a tutor, always mortifying the body in the house of a tutor, is the
third. All these obtain the worlds of the blessed; but the
Brahmasa*m*stha alone (he who is firmly grounded in Brahman) obtains
immortality.

3\. Pra*g*âpati brooded on the worlds. From them, thus brooded on, the
threefold knowledge (sacrifice) issued forth. He brooded on it, and from
it, thus brooded on, issued the three syllables, Bhû*h*, Bhuva*h*,
Sva*h*.

4\. He brooded on them, and from them, thus brooded on, issued the Om.
As all leaves are attached to a stalk, so is all speech (all words)
attached to the Om (Brahman). Om is all this, yea, Om is all this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_156"></span>[35:1](sbe01057.htm#fr_157.md) Not the first in
rank or succession, but only in enumerating the three branches of the
law. This first branch corresponds to the second stage, the â*s*rama of
the householder. Austerity is meant for the Vânaprastha, the third
â*s*rama, while the third is intended for the Brahma*k*ârin, the
student, only that the naish*th*ika or perpetual Brahma*k*ârin here
takes the place of the ordinary student. The Brahmasa*m*stha would
represent the fourth â*s*rama, that of the Sannyâsin or parivrâ*g*, who
has ceased to perform any works, even the tapas or austerities of the
Vânaprastha.
