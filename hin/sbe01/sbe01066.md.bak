*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### EIGHTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. On the third of these nectars the Âdityas live, with Varu*n*a at
their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by
seeing the nectar.

2\. They enter into that (dark) colour, and they rise from that colour.

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Âdityas, with
Varu*n*a at their head, he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having
entered that colour, rises again from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the south and sets in the north, twice
as long does it rise in the west and set in the east; and so long does
he follow the sovereign supremacy of the Âdityas.
