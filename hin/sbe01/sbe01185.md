### SECOND KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_409"></span>[6](#fn_407).

1\. He recites the hymn, asat su me *g*arita*h* sâbhivega*h* (Rv. X, 27,
1), (and in. it the word) satyadhv*ri*tam, the destroyer of truth.
Verily, that day

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

is truth, and as endowed with the word satya, truth, the form of this
day is perfect <span id="fr_410"></span>[1](#fn_408).

2\. That hymn is composed by Vasukra. Verily, Vasukra is Brahman, and
that day is Brahman. Thus he obtains Brahman by means of Brahman <span
id="fr_411"></span>[2](#fn_409).

3\. Here they say: 'Why then is that Marutvatîya, hymn completed by the
hymn of Vasukra?' Surely because no other *Ri*shi but Vasukra brought
out a Marutvatîya hymn, or divided it properly <span
id="fr_412"></span>[3](#fn_410). Therefore that Marutvatîya hymn is
completed by the hymn of Vasukra.

4\. That hymn, asat su me, is not definitely addressed to any deity, and
is therefore supposed to be addressed to Pra*g*âpati. Verily,
Pra*g*âpati is indefinite, and therefore the hymn serves to win
Pra*g*âpati.

5\. Once in the hymn (Rv. X, 27, 22) he defines Indra (indrâya sunvat);
therefore it does not fall off from its form, as connected with Indra.

6\. He recites the hymn (Rv. VI, 17, 1) pibâ somam abhi yam ugra
tarda*h*.

7\. In the verse ûrvam gavyam mahi g*rin*âna indra the word mahi, great,
occurs. Endowed with the word mahat, the form of this day is perfect.

8\. That hymn is composed by Bharadvâ*g*a, and Bharadvâ*g*a was he who
knew most, who lived longest, and performed the greatest austerities
among the *Ri*shis, and by this hymn he drove away evil. Therefore if he
recites the hymn of Bharadvâ*g*a,

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

then, after having driven away evil, he becomes learned, long-lived, and
full of austerities.

9\. He recites the hymn kayâ subhâ savayasa*h* sanîlâ*h* (Rv. I, 165,
1).

10\. In the verse â *s*âsate prati haryanty ukthâ (Rv. I, 165, 4) the
word uktha occurs. Verily, that day (the mahâvrata) is uktha (hymn).
Endowed with the word uktha, the form of this day becomes perfect.

11\. That hymn is called Kayâ*s*ubhîya <span
id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_411). Verily, that hymn, which is called
Kayâ*s*ubhîya, is mutual understanding and it is lasting. By means of it
Indra, Agastya, and the Maruts came to a mutual understanding.
Therefore, if he recites the Kayâ*s*ubhîya hymn, it serves for mutual
understanding.

12\. The same hymn is also long life. Therefore, if the sacrificer is
dear to the Hot*ri*, let him recite the Kayâ*s*ubhîya hymn for him.

13\. He recites the hymn marutvâ*n* indra v*ri*shabo ra*n*âya (Rv. III,
47, 1).

14\. In it the words indra v*ri*shabha (powerful) occur. Verily,
powerful is a form of Indra <span id="fr_414"></span>[2](#fn_412), this
day belongs to Indra, and this is the perfect form of that day.

15\. That hymn is composed by Vi*s*vâmitra. Verily, Vi*s*vâmitra was the
friend (mitra) of all (vi*s*va).

16\. Everybody is the friend of him who knows this, and for whom a
Hot*ri* priest who knows this, recites this hymn.

17\. The next hymn, *g*anish*th*â ugra*h* sahase turâya (Rv. I, 73, 1),
forms a Nividdhâna <span id="fr_415"></span>[3](#fn_413), and,

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

according to the one-day (ekâha) ceremonial, is perfect in form. On that
day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and has to be
atoned for (by recitation of hymns). Atonement is rest, the one-day
sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year (on the last day but one of
the sacrifice that lasts a whole year) the sacrificers rest on this
atonement as their rest.

He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot*ri* priest
who knows this, recites this hymn <span id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_414).

18\. These, if recited straight on, are ninety-seven verses <span
id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_415). The ninety are three Virâ*g*, each
consisting of thirty, and then the seven verses which are over. Whatever
is the praise of the seven, is the praise of ninety also.

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

19\. By repeating the first and last verses three times each, they
become one hundred and one verses.

20\. There are five fingers, of four joints each, two pits (in the elbow
and the arm), the arm, the eye, the shoulder-blade; this makes
twenty-five. The other three parts have likewise twenty-five each <span
id="fr_418"></span>[1](#fn_416). That makes a hundred, and the trunk is
the one hundred and first.

21\. Hundred is life, health, strength, brightness. The sacrificer as
the one hundred and first rests in life, health, strength, and
brightness.

22\. These verses become Trish*t*ubh <span
id="fr_419"></span>[2](#fn_417), for the noonday-libation consists of
Trish*t*ubh verses.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_407"></span>[168:6](sbe01185.htm#fr_409) The type after
which the Marutvatîya-*s*astra is to be performed is the *K*aturvi*m*sa
day. Hitherto (from â tvâ ratham to naki*h* sudâsa*h*), all that is
taken over from the type to the modification, i. e. the Marutvatîya, has
been explained. Now follow the verses which are new and peculiar to the
Marutvatîya of the Mahâvrata.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[169:1](sbe01185.htm#fr_410) The commentator
endeavours to make the meaning more natural by taking in the word
prahantâ, he who kills the destroyer of truth. But considering the
general character of these remarks, this is hardly necessary.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[169:2](sbe01185.htm#fr_411) Cf. I, 1, 3, 3.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[169:3](sbe01185.htm#fr_412) By separating the
first t*rik*a from the second, and so forth.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[170:1](sbe01185.htm#fr_413) Cf. Ait. Brâhm. V,
16.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[170:2](sbe01185.htm#fr_414) Cf. Ait. Âr. II,
2, 1, 8.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[170:3](sbe01185.htm#fr_415) The hymn consists
of eleven verses. In the middle, after the sixth verse, nivids or
invocations, such as indro marutvân, are inserted, and therefore it is
called a nividdhâna hymn.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[171:1](sbe01185.htm#fr_416) With this hymn the
Marutvatîya-*s*astra is finished. All the hymns from â tvâ ratham to
asat su me *g*aritar are simply taken over from the *K*aturvi*m*sa
ceremonial, the rest are peculiar to the Mahâvrata day, the day
preceding the Udayanîya or final day of the Gavâmayana sattra. All this
is more fully described in the fifth Âra*n*yaka (V, 1, 1, 8), containing
the Sûtras or rules of *S*aunaka, while the earlier Âra*n*yakas are
reckoned as Brâhma*n*as, and are therefore mixed up with matters not
actually required for the performance of the sacrifice.

well as the right, and then the left and right side of the lower body.
Thus we have twenty joints of the five toes, a thigh, a leg, and three
joints, making twenty-five on each side.
