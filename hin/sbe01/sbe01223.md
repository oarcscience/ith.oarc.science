### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. Those deities (devatâ), Agni and the rest, after they had been sent
forth, fell into this great ocean <span id="fr_595"></span>[1](#fn_593.md).

Then he (the Self) besieged him, (the person) with hunger and thirst.

2\. The deities then (tormented by hunger and thirst) spoke to him (the
Self): 'Allow us a place in which we may rest and eat food <span
id="fr_596"></span>[2](#fn_594).' (1.md)

He led a cow towards them (the deities). They said: 'This is not
enough.' He led a horse towards them. They said: 'This is not enough.'
(2)

He led man <span id="fr_597"></span>[3](#fn_595.md) towards them. Then they
said: 'Well done <span id="fr_598"></span>[4](#fn_596.md), indeed.'
Therefore man is well done.

3\. He said to them: 'Enter, each according to his place.' (3)

4\. Then Agni (fire), having become speech, entered the mouth. Vâyu
(air), having become scent, entered the nostrils. Âditya (sun), having
become sight, entered the eyes. The Di*s* (regions), having become
hearing, entered the ears. The shrubs and trees, having become hairs,
entered the skin. *K*andramas (the moon), having become mind, entered

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

the heart. Death, having become down-breathing, entered the navel. The
waters, having become seed, entered the generative organ. (4)

5\. Then Hunger and Thirst spoke to him (the Self): 'Allow us two (a
place).' He said to them: 'I assign you to those very deities there, I
make you co-partners with them.' Therefore to whatever deity an oblation
is offered, hunger and thirst are co-partners in it. (5)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_593"></span>[239:1](sbe01223.htm#fr_595.md) They fell back
into that universal being from whence they had sprung, the first created
person, the Virâ*g*. Or they fell into the world, the last cause of
which is ignorance.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[239:2](sbe01223.htm#fr_596.md) To eat food is
explained to mean to perceive the objects which correspond to the
senses, presided over by the various deities.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[239:3](sbe01223.htm#fr_597.md) Here purusha is
different from the first purusha, the universal person. it can only be
intended for intelligent man.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[239:4](sbe01223.htm#fr_598.md) Suk*ri*ta, well
done, virtue; or, if taken for svak*ri*ta, self-made.
