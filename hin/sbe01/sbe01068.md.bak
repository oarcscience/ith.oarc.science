Textual Heritage

### TENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. On the fifth of these nectars the Sâdhyas live, with Brahman at
their head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by
seeing the nectar.

2\. They enter into that colour, and they rise from that colour.

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Sâdhyas, with
Brahman at their head; he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having
entered that colour, rises again from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the north and sets in the south, twice
as long does it rise above, and set below; and so long does he follow
the sovereign power of the Sâdhyas <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_166"></span>[43:1](sbe01068.htm#fr_167.md) The meaning of the
five Khandas from 6 to 10 is clear, in so far as they are intended to
show that he who knows or meditates on the sacrifices as described
before, enjoys his reward in different worlds with the Vasus, Rudras,
&c. for certain periods of time, till at last he reaches the true
Brahman. Of these periods each succeeding one is supposed to be double
the length of the preceding one. This is expressed by imagining a
migration of the sun from east to south, west, north, and zenith. Each
change of the sun marks a new world, and the duration of each successive
world is computed as double the duration of the preceding world. Similar
ideas have been more fully developed in the Purâ*n*as, and the
commentator is at great pains to remove apparent contradictions between
the Paurâ*n*ik and Vaidik accounts, following, as Ânanda*g*ñânagiri
remarks, the Dravi*d*â*k*ârya (p. 173, l. 13).
