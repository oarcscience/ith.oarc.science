### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'The red colour of burning fire (agni) is the colour of fire, the
white colour of fire is the colour of water, the black colour of fire
the colour of earth. Thus vanishes what we call fire, as a mere variety,
being a name, arising from speech. What is true (satya) are the three
colours (or forms).

2\. 'The red colour of the sun (âditya) is the colour of fire, the white
of water, the black of earth. Thus vanishes what we call the sun, as a
mere variety, being a name, arising from speech. What is true are the
three colours.

3\. 'The red colour of the moon is the colour of fire, the white of
water, the black of earth. Thus vanishes what we call the moon, as a
mere variety, being a name, arising from speech. What is true are the
three colours.

4\. 'The red colour of the lightning is the colour of fire, the white of
water, the black of earth. Thus

vanishes what we call the lightning, as a mere variety, being a name,
arising from speech. What is true are the three colours.

5\. 'Great householders and great theologians of olden times who knew
this, have declared the same, saying, "No one can henceforth mention to
us anything which we have not heard, perceived, or known <span
id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_279)." Out of these (three colours or forms)
they knew all.

6\. 'Whatever they thought looked red, they knew was the colour of fire.
Whatever they thought looked white, they knew was the colour of water.
Whatever they thought looked black, they knew was the colour of earth.

7\. 'Whatever they thought was altogether unknown, they knew was some
combination of those three beings (devatâ).

'Now learn from me, my friend, how those three beings, when they reach
man, become each of them tripartite.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[96:1](sbe01122.htm#fr_281) This reminds one of
the Aristotelian διὰ γὰρ ταῦτα καὶ ἐκ τούτων τἄλλα γνωρίζεται, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ
ταῦτα διὰ τῶν ὑποκειμένων.
