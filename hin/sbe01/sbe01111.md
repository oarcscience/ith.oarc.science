*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SEVENTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Then he said to Auddâlaka Âruni: 'O Gautama, whom do you meditate on
as the Self?' He replied: 'The earth only, venerable king.' He said:
'The Self which you meditate on is the Vai*s*vânara Self, called
Pratish*th*â (firm rest). Therefore you stand firm with offspring and
cattle.

2\. 'You eat food and see your desire, and whoever thus meditates on
that Vai*s*vânara Self, eats food and sees his desire, and has Vedic
glory in his house.

'That, however, are but the feet of the Self, and your feet would have
given way, if you had not come to me.'
