<p>The son did as he was commanded.</p>  
<p>The father said to him: 'Bring me the salt, which you placed in the water last night.'</p>

<p>The son having looked for it, found it not, for, of course, it was melted.</p>

<p>The son replied: 'It is salt.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_291"></A><A HREF="sbe01130.htm#fr_293">104:1</A> The question which the son is supposed to have asked is How can this universe which has the form and name of earth &amp;c. be produced from the Sat which is subtile, and has neither form nor name?</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_292"></A><A HREF="sbe01131.htm#fr_294">104:2</A> The question here is supposed to have been: If the Sat is the root of all that exists, why is it not perceived?</P>
