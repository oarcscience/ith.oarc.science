### FOURTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Then he said to Indradyumna Bhâllaveya: 'O Vaiyâghrapadya, whom do
you meditate on as the Self?' He replied: 'Air only, venerable king.' He
said: 'The Self which you meditate on is the Vai*s*vânara Self, called
P*ri*thagvartman (having various courses). Therefore offerings come to
you in various ways, and rows of cars follow you in various ways.

2\. 'You eat food and see your desire, and whoever thus meditates on
that Vai*s*vânara Self, eats food and sees his desire, and has Vedic
glory in his house.

'That, however, is but the breath of the Self, and your breath would
have left you, if you had not come to me.'
