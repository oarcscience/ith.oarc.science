### FIFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. What people call sacrifice (ya*g*ña), that is really abstinence
(brahma*k*arya). For he who knows, obtains that (world of Brahman, which
others obtain by sacrifice), by means of abstinence.

What people call sacrifice (ish*t*a), that is really abstinence, for by
abstinence, having searched (ish*t*vâ), he obtains the Self.

2\. What people call sacrifice (sattrâya*n*a), that is really
abstinence, for by abstinence he obtains from the Sat (the true), the
safety (trâ*n*a) of the Self.

What people call the vow of silence (mauna), that is really abstinence,
for he who by abstinence has found out the Self, meditates (manute).

3\. What people call fasting (anâ*s*akâyana), that is really abstinence,
for that Self does not perish (na na*s*yati), which we find out by
abstinence.

What people call a hermit's life (ara*n*yâyana), that is really
abstinence. Ara <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_335.md) and *N*ya are two
lakes in the world of Brahman, in the third heaven from hence; and there
is the lake Airanimadîya, and the A*s*vattha tree, showering down Soma,
and the city of Brahman (Hira*n*yagarbha) Aparâ*g*itâ <span
id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_336.md), and the golden Prabhuvimita (the hall
built by Prabhu, Brahman).

Now that world of Brahman belongs to those who find the lakes Ara and
*N*ya in the world of Brahman by means of abstinence; for them there is
freedom in all the worlds <span id="fr_339"></span>[3](#fn_337.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_335"></span>[131:1](sbe01165.htm#fr_337.md) In the Kaush. Br.
Up. I, 3, the lake is called Ara, at least according to the commentator.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[131:2](sbe01165.htm#fr_338.md) In the Kaush. Br.
Up. Aparâ*g*ita is not pû*h*, but âyatanam.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[131:3](sbe01165.htm#fr_339.md) The fifth kha*nd*a
is chiefly meant to recommend brahma*k*arya <span id="page_132">p.
132</span> or abstinence from all worldly enjoyments, enjoined on the
brahma*k*ârin, the student, as a means of obtaining a knowledge of
Brahman. But instead of showing that such abstinence is indispensable
for a proper concentration of our intellectual faculties, we are told
that abstinence is the same as certain sacrifices; and this is shown,
not by arguments, but by a number of very far-fetched plays on words.
These it is impossible to render in any translation, nay, they hardly
deserve being translated. Thus abstinence is said to be identical with
sacrifice, ya*g*ña, because yo *g*ñâtâ, 'he who knows,' has a certain
similarity with ya*g*ña. Ish*t*a, another kind of sacrifice, is compared
with esha*n*â, search; sattrâya*n*a with Sat, the True, the Brahman, and
trâya*n*a, protection; mauna, silence, with manana, meditating (which
may be right); anâ*s*akâyana, fasting, with na*s*, to perish, and
ara*n*yâgana, a hermit's life, with ara, *n*ya, and ayana, going to the
two lakes Ara and *N*ya, which are believed to exist in the legendary
world of Brahman. Nothing can be more absurd. Having once struck the
note of Brahmanic legends, such as we find it, for instance, in the
Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a-upanishad, the author goes on. Besides the lakes
Ara and *N*ya (in the Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a-upanishad we have only one
lake, called Âra), he mentions the Airammadîya lake, and explains it as
aira (irâ annam, tanmaya airo ma*nd*as, tena pûr*n*am airam) and madîya,
delightful. The Asvattha tree, which pours down Soma, is not tortured
into anything else, except that Soma is explained as the immortal, or
nectar. Aparâ*g*ita becomes the city of Brahman, because it can be
conquered by no one except those who have practised abstinence. And the
hall which elsewhere is called Vibhu-pramita becomes Prabhu-vimitam, or
Prabhu-vinirmita, made by Prabhu, i.e. Brahman. All the fulfilled
desires, as enumerated in kha*nd*as 2-5, whether the finding again of
our fathers and mothers, or entering the Brahmaloka with its lakes and
palaces, must be taken, not as material (sthûla), but as mental only
(mânasa). On that account, however, they are by no means considered as
false or unreal, as little as dreams are. Dreams are false and unreal,
relatively only, i. e. relatively to what we see, when we awake; but not
in themselves. Whatever we see in waking, also, has been shown to be
<span id="page_133">p. 133</span> false; because it consists of forms
and names only; yet these forms and names have a true element in them,
viz. the Sat. Before we know that Sat, all the objects we see in waking
seem true; as dreams seem true in dreaming. But when once we awake from
our waking by true knowledge, we see that nothing is true but the Sat.
When we imagine we see a serpent, and then discover that it is a rope,
the serpent disappears as false, but what was true in it, the rope,
remains true.
