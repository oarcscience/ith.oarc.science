Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Speech is his (the breath's) rope, the names the knots <span
id="fr_521"></span>[2](#fn_519.md). Thus by his speech as by a rope, and by
his names as by knots, all this is bound. For all this are names indeed,
and with speech he calls everything.

2\. People carry him who knows this, as if they were bound by a rope.

3\. Of the body of the breath thus meditated on, the Ush*n*ih verse
forms the hairs, the Gâyatrî the skin, the Trish*t*ubh the flesh, the
Anush*t*ubh the muscles, the *G*agatî the bone, the Paṅkti the marrow,
the B*ri*hatî the breath <span id="fr_522"></span>[3](#fn_520.md)
(prâ*n*a). He is covered with the verses (kha*nd*as, metres). Because he
is thus covered with verses, therefore they call them kha*nd*as
(coverings, metres).

4\. If a man knows the reason why kha*nd*as are called kha*nd*as, the
verses cover him in whatever place he likes against any evil deed.

5\. This is said by a *Ri*shi (Rv. I, 164, 13):--

6\. 'I saw (the breath) as a guardian, never tiring, coming and going on
his ways (the arteries). That breath (in the body, being identified with
the sun among the Devas), illuminating the principal and intermediate
quarters of the sky, is returning constantly in the midst of the
worlds.'

He says: 'I saw a guardian,' because he, the breath, is a guardian, for
he guards everything.

7\. He says: 'Never tiring,' because the breath never rests.

8\. He says: 'Coming and going on his ways,' because the breath comes
and goes on his ways.

9\. He says: 'Illuminating the principal and intermediate,' because he
illuminates these only, the principal and intermediate quarters of the
sky.

10\. He says. 'He is returning constantly in the midst of the worlds,'
because he returns indeed constantly in the midst of the worlds.

11\. And then, there is another verse (Rv. I, 55, 81): 'They are covered
like caves by those who make them,'

12\. For all this is covered indeed by breath.

13\. This ether is supported by breath as B*ri*hatî, and as this ether
is supported by breath as B*ri*hatî, so one should know that all things,
not excepting ants, are supported by breath as B*ri*hatî.
