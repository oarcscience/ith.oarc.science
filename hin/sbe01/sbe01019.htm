<p>IN giving a translation of the Aitareya-upanishad, I found it necessary to give at the same time a translation of that portion of the Aitareya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka which precedes the Upanishad. The &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas seem to have been from the beginning the proper repositories of the ancient Upanishads, though it is difficult at first sight to find out in what relation the Upanishads stood to the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas. The &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas are to be read and studied, not in the village (gr&acirc;me), but in the forest, and so are the Upanishads. But the subjects treated in the Upanishads belong to a very different order from those treated in the other portions of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas, the former being philosophical, the latter liturgical.</p>  
<p>The liturgical chapters of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas might quite as well have formed part of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and but for the restriction that they are to be read in the forest, it is difficult to distinguish between them and the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as. The</p>  
<p><a name="page_xcii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcii</font></A></p>  
<p>first chapter of the Aitareya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka is a mere continuation of the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and gives the description of the Mah&acirc;vrata, the last day but one of the Gav&acirc;mayana, a sattra or sacrifice which is supposed to last a whole year. The duties which are to be performed by the Hot<I>ri</I> priests are described in the Aitareya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka; not all, however, but those only which are peculiar to the Mah&acirc;vrata day. The general rules for the performance of the Mah&acirc;vrata are to be taken over from other sacrifices, such as the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it, Katurvi<I>m</I>sa, &amp;c., which form the type (prak<I>ri</I>ti) of the Mah&acirc;vrata. Thus the two <I>s</I>astras or recitations, called &acirc;gya-pra&uuml;ga, are taken over from the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it, the <I>s</I>astras of the Hotrakas from the Katurvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a. The Mah&acirc;vrata is treated here as belonging to the Gav&acirc;mayana sattra, which is described in a different <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;, see Taittir&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; VII, 5, 8, and partly in other Vedas. It is the day preceding the udayan&icirc;ya, the last day of the sattra. It can be celebrated, however, by itself also, as an ek&acirc;ha or ah&icirc;na sacrifice, and in the latter case it is the tenth day of the Ekada<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra (eleven nights sacrifice) called Pu<I>n</I><I>d</I>ar&icirc;ka.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;yana does not hesitate to speak of the Aitareya-&Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka as a part of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and a still earlier authority, <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara, by calling the Aitareya-upanishad by the name of Bahvrika-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a-upanishad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, seems to imply that both the Upanishad and the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka may be classed as Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>The Aitareya-&Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka appears at first sight a miscellaneous work, consisting of liturgical treatises in the first, fourth, and fifth &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas, and of three Upanishads, in the second and third &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas. This, however, is not the case. The first &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka is purely liturgical, giving a description of the Mah&acirc;vrata, so far as it concerns the Hot<I>ri</I> priest. It is written in the ordinary Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a style. Then follows the first Upanishad, &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka II, 1-3, showing</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xciii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xciii</font></A></p>  
<p>how certain portions of the Mah&acirc;vrata, as described in the first &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, can be made to suggest a deeper meaning, and ought to lead the mind of the sacrificer away from the purely outward ceremonial to meditation on higher subjects. Without a knowledge of the first &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka therefore the first Upanishad would be almost unintelligible, and though its translation was extremely tedious, it could not well have been omitted.</p>  
<p>The second and third Upanishads are not connected with the ceremonial of the Mah&acirc;vrata, but in the fourth and fifth &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas the Mah&acirc;vrata forms again the principal subject, treated, however, not as before in the style of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, but in the style of S&ucirc;tras. The fourth &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka contains nothing but a list of the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc; hymns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, but the fifth describes the Mah&acirc;vrata again, so that if the first &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka may be looked upon as a portion of the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, the fifth could best be classed with the S&ucirc;tras of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana.</p>  
<p>To a certain extent this fact, the composite character of the Aitareya-&Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, is recognised even by native scholars, who generally do not trouble themselves much on such questions. They look both on the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and on the greater portion of Aitareya-&Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka as the works of an inspired Rishi, Mahid&acirc;sa Aitareya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, but they consider the fourth and fifth books of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka as contributed by purely human authors, such as &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana and Saunaka, who, like other S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ras, took in verses belonging to other <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s, and did not confine their rules to their own <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; only.</p>  
<p>There are many legends about Mahid&acirc;sa, the reputed author of the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka. He is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xciv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xciv</font></A></p>  
<p>quoted several times as Mahid&acirc;sa Aitareya in the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka itself, though not in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. We also meet his name in the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya-upanishad (III, 16, 7), where we are told that he lived to an age of 116 years&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. All this, however, would only prove that, at the time of the composition or collection of these &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas and Upanishads, a sage was known of the name of Mahid&acirc;sa Aitareya, descended possibly from Itara or Itar&acirc;. and that one text of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas of the Bahvrikas was handed down in the family of the Aitareyins.</p>  
<p>Not content with this apparently very obvious explanation, later theologians tried to discover their own reasons for the name of Aitareya. Thus S&acirc;yana, in his introduction to the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, tells us that there was once a Rishi who had many wives. One of them was called Itar&acirc;, and she had a son called Mahid&acirc;sa. His father preferred the sons of his other wives to Mahid&acirc;sa, and once he insulted him in the sacrificial hall, by placing his other sons on his lap, but not Mahid&acirc;sa. Mahid&acirc;sa's mother, seeing her son with tears in his eyes, prayed to her tutelary goddess, the Earth (sv&icirc;yakuladevat&acirc; Bh&ucirc;mi<I>h</I>), and the goddess in her heavenly form appeared in the midst of the assembly, placed Mahid&acirc;sa on a throne, and on account of his learning, gave him the gift of knowing the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, consisting of forty adhy&acirc;yas, and, as S&acirc;yana calls it, another Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, 'treating of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka duties' (&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakavratar&ucirc;pam br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>am).</p>  
<p>Without attaching much value to the legend of Itar&acirc;, we see at all events that S&acirc;yana considered what we call the Aitarey&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka as a kind of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, not however the whole of it, but only the first, second, and third &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas (atha mah&acirc;vratam &icirc;ty&acirc;dikam &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ry&acirc;&nbsp;&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ry&acirc; ityantam). How easy it was for Hindu theologians to invent such legends we see from another account of Mahid&acirc;sa, given by &Acirc;nandat&icirc;rtha in his notes on the Aitareya-upanishad.</p>  
<p>

<p><a name="page_xcv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcv</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> He, as Colebrooke was the first to point out, takes Mahid&acirc;sa 'to be an incarnation of N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, proceeding from Vi<I>s</I>&acirc;la, son of Ab<I>g</I>a,' and he adds, that on the sudden appearance of this deity at a solemn celebration, the whole assembly of gods and priests (suraviprasa&#7749;gha) fainted, but at the intercession of Brahm&acirc;, they were revived, and after making their obeisance, they were instructed in holy science. This avat&acirc;ra was called Mahid&acirc;sa, because those venerable personages (mahin) declared themselves to be his slaves (d&acirc;sa)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>In order properly to understand this legend, we must remember that &Acirc;nandat&icirc;rtha, or rather Vi<I>s</I>ve<I>s</I>varat&icirc;rtha, whose commentary he explains, treated the whole of the Mahaitareya-upanishad from a Vaish<I>n</I>ava point of view, and that his object was to identify Mahid&acirc;sa with N&acirc;r&acirc;yana. He therefore represents N&acirc;r&acirc;yana or Hari as the avat&acirc;ra of Vis&acirc;la, the son of Brahman (ab<I>g</I>asuta), who appeared at a sacrifice, as described before, who received then and there the name of Mahid&acirc;sa (or Mah&icirc;d&acirc;sa), and who taught this Upanishad. Any other person besides Mahid&acirc;sa would have been identified with the same ease by Vi<I>s</I>ve<I>s</I>varat&icirc;rtha with Vish<I>n</I>u or Bhagavat.</p>  
<p>A third legend has been made up out of these two by European scholars who represent Mahid&acirc;sa as the son of Vi<I>s</I>&acirc;la and Itar&acirc;, two persons who probably never met before, for even the Vaish<I>n</I>ava commentator does not attempt to take liberties with the name of Aitareya, but simply states that the Upanishad was called Aitarey&icirc;, from Aitareya.</p>  
<p>Leaving these legends for what they are worth, we may at all events retain the fact that, whoever was the author of the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a and the first three books of the Aitareya-&Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, was not the author of the two concluding &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas. And this is confirmed in different ways. S&acirc;yana, when quoting in his commentary on the Rig-veda from the last books, constantly calls it a S&ucirc;tra of <I>S</I>aunaka, while the fourth &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka is specially ascribed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xcvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcvi</font></A></p>  
<p>to &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana, the pupil and successor of Saunaka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. These two names of <I>S</I>aunaka and &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana are frequently intermixed. If, however, in certain MSS. the whole of the Aitareya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka is sometimes ascribed either to &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana or <I>S</I>aunaka, this is more probably due to the colophon of the fourth and fifth &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas having been mistaken for the title of the whole work than to the fact that such MSS. represent the text of the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, as adopted by the school of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana.</p>  
<p>The Aitareya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka consists of the following five &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas:</p>  
<p>The first &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka has five Adhy&acirc;yas:</p>  
<p>1. First Adhy&acirc;ya, Atha mah&acirc;vratam, has four Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 1-4.<br> 2. Second Adhy&acirc;ya, &Acirc; tv&acirc; ratham, has four Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 5-8.<br> 3. Third Adhy&acirc;ya, Hi&#7749;k&acirc;re<I>n</I>a, has eight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 9-16.<br> 4. Fourth Adhy&acirc;ya, Atha s&ucirc;dadoh&acirc;<I>h</I>, has three Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 17-19.<br> 5. Fifth Adhy&acirc;ya, Va<I>s</I>a<I>m</I> sa<I>m</I>sati, has three Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 20-22.</p>  
<p>The second &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka has seven Adhy&acirc;yas:</p>  
<p>6. First Adhy&acirc;ya, Esh&acirc; panth&acirc;<I>h</I>, has eight Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 1-8.<br> 7. Second Adhy&acirc;ya, Esha ima<I>m</I> lokam, has four Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 9-12.<br> 8. Third Adhy&acirc;ya, Yo ha v&acirc; &acirc;tm&acirc;nam, has eight (not three) Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 13-20.<br> 9. Fourth Adhy&acirc;ya, &Acirc;tma v&acirc; idam, has three Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 21-23.<br> 10. Fifth Adhy&acirc;ya, Purushe ha v&acirc;, has one Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, 24<br> 11. Sixth Adhy&acirc;ya, Ko 'yam &acirc;tmeti, has one Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, 25.<br> 12. Seventh Adhy&acirc;ya, V&acirc;&#7749; me manasi, has one Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, 26.</p>  
<p>The third &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka has two Adhy&acirc;yas:</p>  
<p>13. First Adhy&acirc;ya, Ath&acirc;ta<I>h</I> sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;y&acirc; upanishat, has six Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 1-6.<br> 14. Second Adhy&acirc;ya, Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>o va<I>m</I>sa iti sthavira<I>h</I> <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya<I>h</I>, has six Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 7-12.</p>  
<p>The fourth &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, has one Adhy&acirc;ya:</p>  
<p>15. First Adhy&acirc;ya, Vid&acirc; maghavan, has one Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>a (the Mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc;'s).</p>  
<p>The fifth &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka has three Adhy&acirc;yas:</p>  
<p>16. First Adhy&acirc;ya, Mah&acirc;vratasya pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>avi<I>m</I>satim, has six Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 1-6.<br> 17. Second Adhy&acirc;ya, (Gr&icirc;v&acirc;<I>h</I>)Yasyedam, has five Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 7-11.<br> 18. Third Adhy&acirc;ya, (&Ucirc;r&ucirc;) Indr&acirc;gn&icirc;, has four Kha<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, 11-14</p>  
<p>(9-11 are labelled Aitareya-upanishad and 6-14 are labelled Bahv<I>ri</I><I>k</I>a-upanishad by vertical brackets in the original)</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xcvii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcvii</font></A></p>  
<p>With regard to the Upanishad, we must distinguish between the Aitareya-upanishad, properly so-called, which fills the fourth, fifth, and sixth adhy&acirc;yas of the second &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, and the Mahaitareya-upanishad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, also called by a more general name Bahv<I>ri</I><I>k</I>a-upanishad, which comprises the whole of the second and third &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas.</p>  
<p>The Persian translator seems to have confined himself to the second &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, to which he gives various titles, Sarbsar, Asarbeh, Antrteheh. That Antrteheh <A NAME="img_i09700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/i09700.jpg"> is a misreading of <A NAME="img_i09701"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/i09701.jpg"> was pointed out long ago by Burnouf, and the same explanation applies probably to <A NAME="img_i09702"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/i09702.jpg">, asarbeh, and if to that, then to Sarbsar also. No explanation has ever been given why the Aitareya-upanishad should have been called Sarvas&acirc;ra, which Professor Weber thinks was corrupted into Sarbsar. At all events the Aitareya-upanishad is not the Sarvas&acirc;ra-upanishad, the Oupnek'hat Sarb, more correctly called Sarvopanishats&acirc;ra, and ascribed either to the Taittir&icirc;yaka or to the Atharva-veda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The Aitareya-upanishad, properly so called, has been edited and translated in the Bibliotheca Indica by Dr. R&ouml;er. The whole of the Aitareya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka with S&acirc;yana's commentary was published in the same series by Rajendralal Mitra.</p>  
<p>Though I have had several MSS. of the text and commentary at my disposal, I have derived little aid from them, but have throughout endeavoured to restore that text which <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara (the pupil of Govinda) and S&acirc;yana had before them. S&acirc;yana, for the Upanishad portion, follows <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara's commentary, of which we have a gloss by &Acirc;nandag&ntilde;&acirc;na.</p>  
<p>Colebrooke in his Essays (vol. ii, p. 42) says that he</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xcviii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcviii</font></A></p>  
<p>possessed one gloss by N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>endra on <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara's commentary, and another by &Acirc;nandat&icirc;rtha on a different gloss for the entire Upanishad. The gloss by N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>endra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, however, is, so Dr. Rost informs me, the same as that of &Acirc;nanda<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;na, while, so far as I can see, the gloss contained in MS. E. I. H. 2386 (also MS. Wilson 401), to which Colebrooke refers, is not a gloss by &Acirc;nandat&icirc;rtha at all, but a gloss by Visvesvarat&icirc;rtha on a commentary by &Acirc;nandat&icirc;rthabhagavatp&acirc;d&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya, also called P&ucirc;r<I>n</I>apra<I>g</I>&ntilde;&acirc;k&acirc;rya, who explained the whole of the Mahaitareya-upanishad from a Vaish<I>n</I>ava point of view.</p>
