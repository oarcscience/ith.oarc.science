*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TWELFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Ether (or space) is better than fire. For in the ether exist both
sun and moon, the lightning, stars, and fire (agni). Through the ether
we call, through the ether we hear, through the ether we answer <span
id="fr_312"></span>[1](#fn_310). In the ether or space we rejoice (when
we are together), and rejoice not (when we are separated). In the ether
everything is born, and towards the ether everything tends when it is
born <span id="fr_313"></span>[2](#fn_311). Meditate on ether.

2\. 'He who meditates on ether as Brahman, obtains the worlds of ether
and of light, which are free from pressure and pain, wide and
spacious <span id="fr_314"></span>[3](#fn_312); he is, as it were, lord
and master as far as ether reaches--he who meditates on ether as
Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than ether?'

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

Yes, there Is something better than ether.'

'Sir, tell it me.'
