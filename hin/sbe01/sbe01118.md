*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TWENTY-FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'If, without knowing this, one offers an Agnihotra, it would be as
if a man were to remove the live coals and pour his libation on dead
ashes.

2\. 'But he who offers this Agnihotra with a full knowledge of its true
purport, he offers it (i.e. he eats food) <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_266.md) in all worlds, in all beings, in all
Selfs.

3\. 'As the soft fibres of the Ishîkâ reed, when thrown into the fire,
are burnt, thus all his sins are burnt whoever offers this Agnihotra
with a full knowledge of its true purport.

4\. 'Even if he gives what is left of his food to a *K*a*nd*âla, it
would be offered in his (the *K*a*nd*âla's) Vai*s*vânara Self. And so it
is said in this *S*loka:--

'As hungry children here on earth sit (expectantly) round their mother,
so do all beings sit round the Agnihotra, yea, round the Agnihotra.'
