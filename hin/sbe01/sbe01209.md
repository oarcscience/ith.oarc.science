### EIGHTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_524"></span>[1](#fn_522.md)

1\. Was it water really? Was it water? Yes, all this was water indeed.
This (water) was the root (cause), that (the world) was the shoot
(effect). He (the person) is the father, they (earth, fire, &c.) are the
sons. Whatever there is belonging to the son, belongs to the father;
whatever there is belonging to the father, belongs to the son. This was
intended <span id="fr_525"></span>[2](#fn_523.md).

2\. Mahidâsa Aitareya, who knew this, said: 'I know myself (reaching) as
far as the gods, and I know the gods (reaching) as far as me. For these

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

gods receive their gifts from hence, and are supported from hence.'

3\. This is the mountain <span id="fr_526"></span>[1](#fn_524.md), viz.
eye, ear, mind, speech, and breath. They call it the mountain of
Brahman.

4\. He who knows this, throws down the evil enemy who hates him; the
evil enemy who hates him is defeated.

5\. He (the Prâ*n*a, identified with Brahman) is the life, the breath;
he is being (while the *g*îvâtman remains), and not-being (when the
*g*îvâtman departs).

6\. The Devas (speech, &c.) worshipped him (prâ*n*a) as Bhûti or being,
and thus they became great beings. And therefore even now a man who
sleeps, breathes like bhûrbhu*h*.

7\. The Asuras worshipped him as Abhûti or not being, and thus they were
defeated.

8\. He who knows this, becomes great by himself, while the evil enemy
who hates him, is defeated.

9\. He (the breath) is death (when he departs), and immortality (while
he abides).

10\. And this has been said by a *Ri*shi (Rv. I, 164, 38):--

11\. 'Downwards and upwards he (the wind of the breath) goes, held by
food;'--for this up-breathing, being held back by the down-breathing,
does not move forward (and leave the body altogether).

12\. 'The immortal dwells with the mortal;'--for through him (the
breath) all this dwells together, the bodies being clearly mortal, but
this being (the breath), being immortal.

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

13\. 'These two (body and breath) go for ever in different directions
(the breath moving the senses of the body, the body supporting the
senses of the breath: the former going upwards to another world, the
body dying and remaining on earth). They increase the one (the body),
but they do not increase the other,' i. e. they increase these bodies
(by food), but this being (breath) is immortal.

14\. He who knows this becomes immortal in that world (having become
united with Hira*n*yagarbha), and is seen as immortal (in the sun) by
all beings, yea, by all beings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_522"></span>[212:1](sbe01209.htm#fr_524.md) Having described
how Prâ*n*a, the breath, and his companions or servants created the
world, he now discusses the question of the material cause of the world
out of which it was created. Water, which is said to be the material of
the world, is explained by the commentator to mean here the five
elements.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[212:2](sbe01209.htm#fr_525.md) Cause and effect
are not entirely separated, therefore water, as the elementary cause,
and earth, fire, &c., as its effect, are one; likewise the worshipper,
as the father, and the earth, fire, &c. as his sons, as described above.
Mûla and tûla, root and shoot, are evidently chosen for the sake of the
rhyme, to signify cause and effect.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[213:1](sbe01209.htm#fr_526.md) Prâ*n*a is called
the giri*h*, because it is swallowed or hidden by the other senses
(gira*n*ât). Again a mere play of words, intended to show that Brahman
under the form of Prâ*n*a, or life, is to be meditated on.
