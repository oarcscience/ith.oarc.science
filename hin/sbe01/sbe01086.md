### NINTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Thus he reached the house of his teacher. The teacher said to him:
'Satyakâma.' He replied: 'Sir.'

2\. The teacher said: 'Friend, you shine like one who knows Brahman. Who
then has taught you <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_207.md)?' He replied:
'Not men. But you only, Sir, I wish, should teach me <span
id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_208.md);

3\. 'For I have heard from men like you, Sir, that only knowledge which
is learnt from a teacher (Â*k*ârya), leads to real good.' Then he taught
him the same knowledge. Nothing was left out, Yea, nothing was left out.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_207"></span>[64:1](sbe01086.htm#fr_208.md) It would have been
a great offence if Satyakâma had accepted instruction from any man,
except his recognised teacher.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[64:2](sbe01086.htm#fr_209.md) The text should be,
bhagavâ*m*s tv eva me kâme brûyât (me kâme = mame*kkh*âyâm).
