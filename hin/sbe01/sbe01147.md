*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THIRTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Memory <span id="fr_315"></span>[1](#fn_313) (smara.md) is better than
ether. Therefore where many are assembled together, if they have no
memory, they would hear no one, they would not perceive, they would not
understand. Through memory we know our sons, through memory our cattle.
Meditate on memory.

2\. 'He who meditates on memory as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and
master as far as memory reaches;--he who meditates on memory as
Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than memory?'

'Yes, there is something better than memory.'

'Sir, tell it me.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_313"></span>[119:1](sbe01147.htm#fr_315.md) The apparent
distance between ether and memory is bridged over by the commentator
pointing out that without memory everything would be as if it were not,
so far as we are concerned.
