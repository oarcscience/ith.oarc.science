### ELEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Then the sacrificer said to him: 'I should like to know who you are,
Sir.' He replied: 'I am Ushasti *K*âkrâya*n*a.'

2\. He said: 'I looked for you, Sir, for all these sacrificial offices,
but not finding you <span id="fr_113"></span>[2](#fn_112.md), I chose
others.'

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

3\. 'But now, Sir, take all the sacrificial offices.'

Ushasti said: 'Very well; but let those, with my permission, perform the
hymns of praise. Only as much wealth as you give to them, so much give
to me also.'

The sacrificer assented.

4\. Then the Prastot*ri* approached him, saying: 'Sir, you said to me,
"Prastot*ri*, if you, without knowing the deity which belongs to the
prastâva, are going to sing it, your head will fall off,"--which then is
that deity?'

5\. He said: 'Breath (prâ*n*a). For all these beings merge into breath
alone, and from breath they arise. This is the deity belonging to the
prastâva. If, without knowing that deity, you had sung forth your hymns,
your head would have fallen off, after you had been warned by me.'

6\. Then the Udgât*ri* approached him, saying: 'Sir, you said to me,
"Udgât*ri*, if you, without knowing the deity which belongs to the
udgîtha, are going to sing it, your head will fall off,"--which then is
that deity?'

7\. He said: 'The sun (âditya). For all these beings praise the sun when
it stands on high. This is the deity belonging to the udgîtha. If,
without knowing that deity, you had sung out your hymns, your head would
have fallen off, after you had been warned by me.'

8\. Then the Pratihart*ri* approached him, saying: 'Sir, you said to me,
"Pratihart*ri*, if you, without knowing the deity belonging to the
pratihâra, are going to sing it, your head will fall off,"--Which then
is that deity?'

9\. He said: 'Food (anna). For all these beings

live when they partake of food. This is the deity belonging to the
pratihâra. If, without knowing that deity, you had sung your hymns, your
head would have fallen off, after you had been warned by me <span
