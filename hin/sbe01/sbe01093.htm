<p>3. He performs perfectly the one way only (that by words), but the other is injured. As a man walking on one foot, or a carriage going on one wheel, is injured, his sacrifice is injured, and with the injured sacrifice the sacrificer is injured; yes, having sacrificed, he becomes worse.</p>  
<p>4. But when after the Pr&acirc;taranuv&acirc;ka ceremony has begun, and before the recitation of the Paridh&acirc;n&icirc;y&acirc; hymn, the Brahman priest has not (to break his silence and) to speak, they perform both ways perfectly, and neither of them is injured.</p>  
<p>5. As a man walking on two legs and a carriage going on two wheels gets on, so his sacrifice gets on, and with the successful sacrifice the sacrificer gets on; yes, having sacrificed, he becomes better.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_220"></A><A HREF="sbe01093.htm#fr_221">68:3</A> If any mistakes happen during the performance of a sacrifice, as described before, they are remedied by certain interjectional <a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></A> syllables (vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>ti), the nature of which is next described. All this is supposed to take place in the forest.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_221"></A><A HREF="sbe01093.htm#fr_222">69:1</A> While the other priests perform the sacrifice, the Brahman priest has to remain silent, following the whole sacrifice in his mind, and watching that no mistake be committed. If a mistake is committed, he has to correct it, and for that purpose certain corrective penances (pr&acirc;ya<I>s</I><I>k</I>itta) are enjoined. The performance of the Brahman priest resembles the meditations of the sages in the forest, and therefore this chapter is here inserted.</P>
