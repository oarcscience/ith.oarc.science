### TENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. When the Kurus had been destroyed by (hail) stones <span
id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_108), Ushasti *K*âkrâya*n*a lived as a beggar
with his virgin <span id="fr_110"></span>[2](#fn_109) wife at
Ibhyagrâma.

2\. Seeing a chief eating beans, he begged of him. The chief said: 'I
have no more, except those which are put away for me here.'

3\. Ushasti said: 'Give me to eat of them.' He gave him the beans, and
said: 'There is something to drink also! Then said Ushasti: 'If I drank
of it, I should have drunk what was left by another, and is therefore
unclean.'

4\. The chief said: 'Were not those beans also left over and therefore
unclean?'

'No,' he replied; 'for I should not have lived, if I had not eaten them,
but the drinking of water would be mere pleasure <span
id="fr_111"></span>[3](#fn_110).'

5\. Having eaten himself, Ushasti gave the remaining beans to his wife.
But she, having eaten before, took them and put them away.

6\. Rising the next morning, Ushasti said to her: 'Alas, if we could
only get some food, we might gain a little wealth. The king here is
going to offer a sacrifice, he should choose me for all the priestly
offices.'

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

7\. His wife said to him: 'Look, here are those beans of yours.' Having
eaten them, he went to the sacrifice which was being performed.

8\. He went and sat down on the orchestra near the Udgât*ri*s, who were
going to sing their hymns of praise. And he said to the Prastot*ri* (the
leader):

9\. 'Prastot*ri*, if you, without knowing <span
id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_111) the deity which belongs to the prastâva
(the hymns &c. of the Prastot*ri*), are going to sing it, your head will
fall off.'

10\. In the same manner he addressed the Udgât*ri*: 'Udgât*ri*, if you,
without knowing the deity which belongs to the udgîtha (the hymns of the
Udgât*ri*), are going to sing it, your head will fall off.'

11\. In the same manner he addressed the Pratihart*ri*: 'Pratihart*ri*,
if you, without knowing the deity which belongs to the pratihâra (the
hymns of the Pratihart*ri*), are going to sing it, your head will fall
off.'

They stopped, and sat down in silence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_108"></span>[18:1](sbe01031.htm#fr_109) When they had been
killed either by stone weapons, or by a shower of stones, which produced
a famine in the land. Comm.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[18:2](sbe01031.htm#fr_110) Â*t*ikî is not the
name of the wife of Ushasti, nor does it mean strong enough to travel.
*S*aṅkara explains it as anupa*g*âtapayodhâridistrîvyañ*g*anâ, and
Ânandagiri adds, Svairasa*m*kâre 'pi na vyabhikâra*s*aṅketi dar*s*ayitum
â*t*ikyeti vi*s*esha*n*am. She was so young that she was allowed to run
about freely, without exciting any suspicion. Another commentator says,
G*ri*hâd bahirgantumarhâ anupa*g*âtapayodharâ.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[18:3](sbe01031.htm#fr_111) Or, according to
the commentator, 'water I can get whenever I like.'

<span id="fn_111"></span>[19:1](sbe01031.htm#fr_112) The commentator is
at great pains to show that a priest may officiate without knowing the
secret meanings here assigned to certain parts of the sacrifice, and
without running any risk of punishment. Only, if another priest is
present, who is initiated, then the uninitiated, taking his place, is in
danger of losing his head.
