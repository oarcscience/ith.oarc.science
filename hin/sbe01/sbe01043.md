### NINTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Let a man meditate on the sevenfold Sâman as the sun. The sun is
Sâman, because he is always the same (sama); he is Sâman because he is
the same, everybody thinking he looks towards me, he looks towards
me <span id="fr_134"></span>[2](#fn_133.md).

2\. Let him know that all beings are dependent on him (the sun). What he
is before his rising, that is the hiṅkâra. On it animals are dependent.
Therefore animals say hiṅ (before sunrise), for they share the hiṅkâra
of that Sâman (the sun).

3\. What he is when first risen, that is the prastâva. On it men are
dependent. Therefore men love praise (prastuti) and celebrity, for they
share the prastâva of that Sâman.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

4\. What he is at the time of the saṅgava <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_134.md), that is the âdi, the first, the Om. On
it birds are dependent. Therefore birds fly about in the sky without
support, holding themselves, for they share the âdi <span
id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_135) (the Om.md) of that Sâman.

5\. What he is just at noon, that is the udgîtha. On it the Devas are
dependent (because they are brilliant). Therefore they are the best of
all the descendants of Pra*g*âpati, for they share the udgîtha of that
Sâman.

6\. What he is after midday and before afternoon, that is the pratihâra.
On it all germs are dependent. Therefore these, having been conceived
(pratih*ri*ta), do not fall, for they share the pratihâra of that Sâman.

7\. What he is after the afternoon and before sunset, that is the
upadrava. On it the animals of the forest are dependent. Therefore, when
they see a man, they run (upadravanti) to the forest as a safe
hiding-place, for they share the upadrava of that Sâman.

8\. What he is when he first sets, that is the nidhana. On it the
fathers are dependent. Therefore they put them <span
id="fr_137"></span>[3](#fn_136) down (nidadhati.md), for they share the
nidhana of that Sâman. Thus a man meditates on the sevenfold Sâman as
the sun.

allowed by the cowherds to suckle their young.

comparationis is here the â of âdi and the â of âdâya, i. e. holding.
The d might have been added.
