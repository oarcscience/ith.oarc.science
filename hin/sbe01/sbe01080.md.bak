Textual Heritage

### THIRD KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Air (vâyu) is indeed the end of all <span
id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_200.md). For when fire goes out, it goes into
air. When the sun goes down, it goes into air. When the moon goes down,
it goes into air.

2\. 'When water dries up, it goes into air. Air indeed consumes them
all. So much with reference to the Devas.

3\. 'Now with reference to the body. Breath (prâ*n*a) is indeed the end
of all. When a man sleeps, speech goes into breath, so do sight,
hearing, and mind. Breath indeed consumes them all.

4\. 'These are the two ends, air among the Devas, breath among the
senses (prâ*n*âh).'

5\. Once while *S*aunaka Kâpeya and Abhipratârin Kâkshaseni were being
waited on at their meal, a religious student begged of them. They gave
him nothing.

6\. He said: 'One god--who is he?--swallowed the four great ones <span
id="fr_202"></span>[3](#fn_201.md), he, the guardian of the world.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O Kâpeya, mortals
see him not, O Abhipratârin, though he dwells in many places. He to whom
this food belongs, to him it has not been given <span
id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_202.md).'

7\. *S*aunaka Kâpeya, pondering on that speech, went to the student and
said: 'He is the self of the Devas, the creator of all beings, with
golden tusks, the eater, not without intelligence. His greatness is said
to be great indeed, because, without being eaten, he eats even what is
not food <span id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_203.md). Thus do we, O
Brahma*k*ârin, meditate on that Being.' Then he said: 'give him food.'

8\. They gave him food. Now these five (the eater Vâyu (air), and his
food, Agni (fire), Âditya (sun), *K*andramas (moon), Ap (water)) and the
other five (the eater Prâ*n*a (breath), and his food, speech, sight,
hearing, mind) make ten, and that is the K*ri*ta (the highest <span
id="fr_205"></span>[3](#fn_204).md) cast (representing the ten, the eaters
and the food). Therefore in all quarters those ten are food (and)
K*ri*ta (the highest cast). These are again the Virâ*g* <span
id="fr_206"></span>[4](#fn_205) (of ten syllables.md)

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

which eats the food. Through this all this becomes seen. He who knows
this sees all this and becomes an eater of food, yea, he becomes an
eater of food.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_200"></span>[58:2](sbe01080.htm#fr_201.md) Sa*m*varga,
absorption, whence sa*m*vargavidyâ, not sa*m*sarga. It is explained by
sa*m*var*g*ana, sa*m*graha*n*a, and sa*m*grasana, in the text itself by
adana, eating.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[58:3](sbe01080.htm#fr_202.md) This must refer to
Vâyu and Prâ*n*a swallowing the four, as explained in IV, 3, 2, and IV,
3, 3. The commentator explains <span id="page_59">p. 59</span> it by
Pra*g*âpati, who is sometimes called Ka. In one sense it would be
Brahman, as represented by Vâyu and Prâ*n*a.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[59:1](sbe01080.htm#fr_203.md) The food which you
have refused to me, you have really refused to Brahman.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[59:2](sbe01080.htm#fr_204.md) *S*aunaka wishes
the student to understand that though I mortals see him not,' he sees
and knows him, viz. the god who, as Vâyu, swallows all the gods, but
produces them again, and who, as prâ*n*a, swallows during sleep all
senses, but produces them again at the time of waking.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[59:3](sbe01080.htm#fr_205.md) The words are
obscure, and the commentator does not throw much light on them. He
explains, however, the four casts of the dice, the K*ri*ta = 4, the
Tretâ = 3, the Dvâpara = 2, the Kali = 1, making together 10, the
K*ri*ta cast absorbing the other casts, and thus counting ten.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[59:4](sbe01080.htm#fr_206.md) Virâ*g*, name of a
metre of ten syllables, and also a name of food. One expects, 'which is
the food and eats the food.'
