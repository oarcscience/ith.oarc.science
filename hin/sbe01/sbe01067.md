Textual Heritage

### NINTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. On the fourth of these nectars the Maruts live, with Soma at their
head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the
nectar.

2\. They enter in that (very dark) colour, and they rise from that
colour.

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Maruts, with Soma
at their head, he sees the nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered
that colour, rises again from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the west and sets

in the east, twice as long does it rise in the north and set in the
south; and so long does he follow the sovereign supremacy of the Maruts.
