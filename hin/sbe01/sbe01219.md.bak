*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. This (nishkevalya-*s*astra) becomes perfect as a thousand of
B*ri*hatî verses. In this thousand of B*ri*hatîs there are one thousand
one hundred and twenty-five Anush*t*ubhs. For the smaller is contained
in the larger.

2\. This has been said by a *Ri*shi (Rv. VIII, 76, 12):--

3\. 'A speech of eight feet;'--because there are eight feet of four
syllables each in the Anush*t*ubh.

4\. 'Of nine corners;'--because the B*ri*hatî becomes nine-cornered
(having nine feet of four syllables each).

5\. 'Touching the truth;'--because speech (Anush*t*ubh) is truth,
touched by the verse (B*ri*hatî) <span id="fr_566"></span>[1](#fn_564.md).

6\. 'He (the Hot*ri*) makes the body out of Indra;--'for out of this
thousand of B*ri*hatî verses turned into Anush*t*ubhs, and therefore out
of Prâ*n*a as connected with Indra <span
id="fr_567"></span>[2](#fn_565.md), and out of the B*ri*hatî (which is
Prâ*n*a), he makes speech, that is Anush*t*ubh, as a body <span
id="fr_568"></span>[3](#fn_566.md).

7\. This Mahaduktha is the highest development

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

of speech, and it is fivefold, viz. measured, not measured, music, true,
and untrue.

8\. A *Rik* verse, a gâthâ <span id="fr_569"></span>[1](#fn_567.md), a
kumbyâ <span id="fr_570"></span>[2](#fn_568) are measured (metrical.md). A
Ya*g*us line, an invocation, and general remarks <span
id="fr_571"></span>[3](#fn_569.md), these are not measured (they are in
prose). A Sâman, or any portion (parvan) of it, is music. Om is true, Na
is untrue.

9\. What is true (Om) is the flower and fruit of speech. He is able to
become celebrated and of good report, for he speaks the true (Om), the
flower and fruit of speech.

10\. Now the untrue is the root <span id="fr_572"></span>[4](#fn_570.md) of
speech, and as a tree whose root is exposed dries up and perishes, thus
a man who says what is untrue exposes his root, dries up and perishes.
Therefore one should not say what is untrue, but guard oneself from it.

11\. That syllable Om (yes) goes forward (to the first cause of the
world) and is empty. Therefore if a man says Om (yes) to everything,
then that (which he gives away) is wanting to him here <span
id="fr_573"></span>[5](#fn_571). If he says Om (yes.md) to everything, then
he would empty himself, and would not be capable of any enjoyments.

12\. That syllable Na (no) is full for oneself <span
id="fr_574"></span>[6](#fn_572.md). If a man says No to everything, then
his reputation

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

would become evil, and that would ruin him even here.

13\. Therefore let a man give at the proper time only, not at the wrong
time. Thus he unites the true and the untrue, and from the union of
those two he grows, and becomes greater and greater.

14\. He who knows this speech of which this (the mahaduktha) is a
development, he is clever. A is the whole of speech, and manifested
through different kinds of contact (mutes) and of wind (sibilants), it
becomes manifold and different.

15\. Speech if uttered in a whisper is breath, if spoken aloud, it is
body. Therefore (if whispered) it is almost hidden, for what is
incorporeal is almost hidden, and breath is incorporeal. But if spoken
aloud, it is body, and therefore it is perceptible, for body is
perceptible.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_564"></span>[229:1](sbe01219.htm#fr_566.md) Vâ*k*, speech,
taking the form of Anush*t*ubh, and being joined with the *Rik*, or the
B*ri*hatî, touches the true, i. e. Prâ*n*a, breath, which is to be
meditated on under the form of the B*ri*hatî. Comm.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[229:2](sbe01219.htm#fr_567.md) Cf. Ait. Âr. II,
2, 3, 4.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[229:3](sbe01219.htm#fr_568.md) Because the
Anush*t*ubh is made out of the B*ri*hatî, the B*ri*hatî being breath,
therefore the Anush*t*ubh is called its body.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[230:1](sbe01219.htm#fr_569.md) A gâthâ is
likewise in verse, for instance, prâta*h* prâtar an*ri*ta*m* te vadanti.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[230:2](sbe01219.htm#fr_570.md) A kumbyâ is a
metrical precept, such as, brahma*k*âryasyâpo*s*âna*m* karma kuru, divi
ma svâpsî*h*, &c.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[230:3](sbe01219.htm#fr_571.md) Such as
arthavâdas, explanatory passages, also gossip, such as is common in the
king's palace, laughing at people, &c.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[230:4](sbe01219.htm#fr_572.md) As diametrically
opposed to the flowers and fruits which represent the true. Comm.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[230:5](sbe01219.htm#fr_573.md) Then that man is
left empty here on earth for that enjoyment. Comm.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[230:6](sbe01219.htm#fr_574.md) He who always says
No, keeps everything to himself.
