Textual Heritage

### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. That Self is a bank <span id="fr_335"></span>[2](#fn_333), a
boundary, so that these worlds may not be confounded. Day and night do
not pass that bank, nor old age, death, and grief; neither good nor evil
deeds. All evil-doers turn back from it, for the world of Brahman is
free from all evil.

2\. Therefore he who has crossed that bank, if blind, ceases to be
blind; if wounded, ceases to be wounded; if afflicted, ceases to be
afflicted. Therefore when that bank has been crossed, night becomes day
indeed, for the world of Brahman is lighted up once for all <span
id="fr_336"></span>[3](#fn_334).

3\. And that world of Brahman belongs to those

only who find it by abstinence--for them there is freedom in all the
worlds.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_333"></span>[130:2](sbe01164.htm#fr_335) Setu, generally
translated by bridge, was originally a bank of earth (m*ri*dâdimaya),
thrown up to serve as a pathway (pons) through water or a swamp. Such
banks exist still in many places, and they serve at the same time as
boundaries (maryâdâ) between fields belonging to different properties.
Cf. Mait. Up. VII, 7; Kâ*th* Up. III, 2; Talav. Up. comm. p. 59; Mu*nd*.
Up. II, 2, 5.
