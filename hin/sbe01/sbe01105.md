Textual Heritage

### ELEVENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_258).

1\. Prâ*k*îna*s*âla Aupamanyava, Satyaya*g*ña Paulushi, Indradyumna
Bhâllaveya, *G*ana *S*ârkarâkshya, and Bu*d*ila Â*s*vatara*s*vi, these
five great householders and great theologians came once together and
held a discussion as to What is our Self, and what is Brahman <span
id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_259).

2\. They reflected and said: 'Sirs, there is that Uddâlaka Âru*n*i, who
knows at present that Self,

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

called Vai*s*vânara. Well, let us go to him.' They went to him.

3\. But he reflected: 'Those great householders and great theologians
will examine me, and I shall not be able to tell them all; therefore I
shall recommend another teacher to them.'

4\. He said to them: 'Sirs, A*s*vapati Kaikeya knows at present that
Self, called Vai*s*vânara. Well, let us go to him.' They went to him.

5\. When they arrived (the king) ordered proper presents to be made
separately to each of them. And rising the next morning <span
id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_260) he said: 'In my kingdom there is no
thief, no miser, no drunkard, no man without an altar in his house, no
ignorant person, no adulterer, much less an adulteress. I <span
id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_261) am going to perform a sacrifice, Sirs,
and as much wealth as I give to each *Ri*tvi*g* priest, I shall give to
you, Sirs. Please to stay here.'

6\. They replied: 'Every man ought to say for what purpose he comes. You
know at present that Vai*s*vânara Self, tell us that.'

7\. He said: 'To-morrow I shall give you an answer.' Therefore on the
next morning they approached him, carrying fuel in their hands (like
students), and he, without first demanding any preparatory rites <span
id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_262), said to them:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_258"></span>[84:1](sbe01105.htm#fr_259) The same story is
found in the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a X, 6, 1,1.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[84:2](sbe01105.htm#fr_260) Âtman and Brâhman
are to be taken as predicate and subject.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[85:1](sbe01105.htm#fr_261) The commentator
explains that the king, seeing that they would not accept his presents,
and thinking that they did not consider him worthy of bestowing presents
on them, made these remarks.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[85:2](sbe01105.htm#fr_262) When they still
refused his presents, he thought the presents he had offered were too
small, and therefore invited them to a sacrifice.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[85:3](sbe01105.htm#fr_263) He was satisfied
with the humility of the Brahmans, who, being Brahmans, came to him, who
was not a Brahman, as pupils. Generally <span id="page_86">p. 86</span>
a pupil has first to pass through several initiatory rites before he is
admitted to the benefit of his master's teaching.
