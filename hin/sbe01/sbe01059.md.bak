## THIRD PRAPÂ*TH*AKA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_158.md).

1\. The sun is indeed the honey <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_159.md) of
the Devas. The heaven is the cross-beam (from which) the sky (hangs as)
a hive, and the bright vapours are the eggs of the bees <span
id="fr_161"></span>[3](#fn_160.md).

2\. The eastern rays of the sun are the honey-cells in front. The *Rik*
verses are the bees, the Rig-veda (sacrifice) is the flower, the water
(of the sacrificial libations) is the nectar (of the flower).

3\. Those very *Rik* verses then (as bees) brooded over the Rig-veda
sacrifice (the flower); and from it, thus brooded on, sprang as its
(nectar) essence, fame, glory of countenance, vigour, strength, and
health <span id="fr_162"></span>[4](#fn_161.md).

4\. That (essence) flowed forth and went towards the sun <span
id="fr_163"></span>[5](#fn_162.md). And that forms what we call the red
(rohita) light of the rising sun.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_158"></span>[38:1](sbe01059.htm#fr_159.md) After the various
meditations on the Sâma-veda sacrifice, the sun is next to be meditated
on, as essential to the performance of all sacrifices.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[38:2](sbe01059.htm#fr_160.md) Everybody delights
in the sun, as the highest reward of all sacrifices.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[38:3](sbe01059.htm#fr_161.md) I am not certain
whether this passage is rightly translated. Rajendralal Mitra speaks of
an arched bamboo, whence the atmosphere hangs pendant like a hive, in
which the vapours are the eggs. Apûpa means a cake, and may mean a hive.
In order to understand the simile, we ought to have a clearer idea of
the construction of the ancient bee-hive.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[38:4](sbe01059.htm#fr_162.md) Annâdya, explained
as food, but more likely meaning power to eat, appetite, health. See
III, 13, 1.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[38:5](sbe01059.htm#fr_163.md) The commentator
explains: The *Rik* verses, on becoming part of the ceremonial, perform
the sacrifice. The sacrifice (the flower), when surrounded by the *Rik*
verses (bees), yields its essence, the nectar. That essence consists in
all the rewards to be obtained through sacrifice, and as these rewards
are to be enjoyed in the <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> next world and
in the sun, therefore that essence or nectar is said to ascend to the
sun.
