### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Next K*ri*sh*n*a-Hârita <span id="fr_681"></span>[4](#fn_679.md)
confided this Brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_682"></span>[5](#fn_680.md)
concerning speech to him (his pupil):

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

2\. Pra*g*âpati, the year, after having sent forth all creatures, burst.
He put himself together again by means of *kh*andas (Vedas). Because he
put himself together again by means of *kh*andas, therefore (the text of
the Veda) is called Sa*m*hitâ (put together).

3\. Of that Sa*m*hitâ the letter *n* is the strength, the letter sh the
breath and self (Âtman).

4\. He who knows the *Rik* verses and the letters *n* and sh for every
Sa*m*hitâ, he knows the Sa*m*hitâ with strength and breath. Let him know
that this is the life of the Sa*m*hitâ.

5\. If the pupil asks, 'Shall I say it with the letter *n* or without
it? 'let the teacher say, 'With the letter *n*.' And if he asks, 'Shall
I say it with the letter sh or without it?' let the teacher say, 'With
the letter sh <span id="fr_683"></span>[1](#fn_681.md).'

6\. Hrasva Mâ*nd*ûkeya said: 'If we here recite the verses according to
the Sa*m*hitâ (attending to the necessary changes of n and s into *n*
and sh <span id="fr_684"></span>[2](#fn_682).md), and if we say the adhyâya
of Mâ*nd*ûkeya (Ait. Âr. III, 1), then the letters *n* and sh (strength
and breath) have by this been obtained for us.'

7\. Sthavira Sâkalya said: 'If we recite the verses according to the
Sa*m*hitâ, and if we say the adhyâya of Mâ*nd*ûkeya, then the letters
*n* and sh have by this been obtained for us.'

8\. Here the *Ri*shis, the Kâvasheyas <span
id="fr_685"></span>[3](#fn_683.md), knowing

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

this, said: 'Why should we repeat (the Veda), why should we sacrifice?
We offer as a sacrifice breath in speech, or speech in breath. What is
the beginning (of one), that is the end (of the other).'

9\. Let no one tell these Sa*m*hitâs (Ait. Âr. III, 1-III, 2) to one who
is not a resident pupil, who has not been with his teacher at least one
year, and who is not himself to become an instructor <span
id="fr_686"></span>[1](#fn_684.md). Thus say the teachers, yea, thus say
the teachers.

, and then rest in another place finishing it.

11\. 'And in the place where he reads this, he should not read <span
id="page_268">p. 268</span> anything else, though he may read this (the
Mahâvrata) where he has read something else.

12\. 'No one should bathe and become a snâtaka <span
id="fr_692"></span>[1c](#fn_690.md) who does not read this. Even if he has
read many other things, he should not become a snâtaka if he has not
read this.

13\. 'Nor should he forget it, and even if he should forget anything
else, he should not forget this.

14\. 'No, he should never forget this.

15\. 'If he does not forget this, it will be enough for himself (or for
acquiring a knowledge of the Self).

16\. 'It is enough, let him know this to be true.

17\. 'Let him who knows this not communicate, nor dine, nor amuse
himself with any one who does not know it.'

Then follow some more rules as to the reading of the Veda in general:

18\. 'When the old water that stood round the roots of trees is dried up
(after about the month of Pausha, January to February <span
id="fr_693"></span>[2c](#fn_691)) he should not read; nor (at any time.md)
in the morning or in the afternoon, when the shadows meet (he should
begin at sunrise so soon as the shadows divide, and end in the evening
before they fall together). Nor should he read <span
id="fr_694"></span>[3c](#fn_692.md) when a cloud has risen; and when there
is an unseasonable rain (after the months of Srâva*n*a and Bhâdrapada,
August and September <span id="fr_695"></span>[4c](#fn_693).md) he should
stop his Vedic reading for three nights. Nor should he at that time tell
stories, not even during the night, nor should he glory in his
knowledge.

19\. 'This (the Veda thus learnt and studied) is the name of that Great
Being; and he who thus knows the name of that Great Being, he becomes
Brahman, yea, he becomes Brahman.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_679"></span>[264:4](sbe01238.htm#fr_681.md) One of the sons of
Harita, who was dark. Comm.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[264:5](sbe01238.htm#fr_682.md) Brâhma*n*a, in the
sense of Upanishad, this secret doctrine or explanation. It forms an
appendix, like the svish*t*ak*ri*t at the end of a sacrifice. 'Iva,'
which the commentator explains as restrictive or useless, may mean,
something like a Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[265:1](sbe01238.htm#fr_683.md) The letters n and
sh refer most likely to the rules of *n*atva and shatva, i. e. the
changing of n and s into *n* and sh.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[265:2](sbe01238.htm#fr_684.md) If we know
whenever n and s should be changed to *n* and sh in the Sa*m*hitâ.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[265:3](sbe01238.htm#fr_685.md) The Kâvasheyas
said that, after they had arrived at the highest knowledge of Brahman
(through the various forms of meditation and worship that lead to it and
that have been described in the Upanishad) no further meditation and no
further sacrifice could be <span id="page_266">p. 266</span> required.
Instead of the morning and evening stoma they offer breath in speech,
whenever they speak, or speech in breath, when they are silent or
asleep. When speech begins, breathing ceases; when breathing begins,
speech ceases.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[266:1](sbe01238.htm#fr_686.md) The strict
prohibition uttered at the end of the third Âra*n*yaka, not to divulge a
knowledge of the Sa*m*hitâ-upanishad (Ait. Âr. III, 1-2), as here
explained, is peculiar. It would have seemed self-evident that, like the
rest of the *s*ruti or sacred literature, the Âra*n*yaka too, and every
portion of it, could have been learnt from the mouth of a teacher only,
and according to rule (niyamena), i. e. by a pupil performing all the
duties of a student (brahma*k*ârin <span
id="fr_687"></span>[2a](#fn_686).md), so that no one except a regular pupil
(antevâsin) could possibly gain access to it. Nor can there be any doubt
that we ought to take the words asa*m*vatsaravâsin and apravakt*ri* as
limitations, and to translate, 'Let no one tell these Sa*m*hitâs to any
pupil who has not at least been a year with his master, and who does not
mean to become a teacher in turn.'

That this is the right view is confirmed by similar injunctions given at
the end of the fifth Âra*n*yaka. Here we have first some rules as to who
is qualified to recite the Mahâvrata. No one is permitted to do so, who
has not passed through the Dîkshâ, the initiation for the Agnish*t*oma.
If the Mahâvrata is performed as a Sattra, the sacrificer is a Hotri
priest, and he naturally has passed through that ceremony. But if the
Mahâvrata is performed as an Ekâha or Ahîna ceremony, anybody might be
the sacrificer, and therefore it was necessary to say that no one who is
adîkshita, uninitiated, should recite it for another person; nor should
he do so, <span id="page_267">p. 267</span> when the Mahâvrata is
performed without (or with) an altar, or if it does not last one year.
In saying, however, that one should not recite the Mahâvrata for another
person, parents and teachers are not to be understood as included,
because what is done for them, is done for ourselves.

After these restrictions as to the recitation of the Mahâvrata, follow
other restrictions as to the teaching of it, and here we read, as at the
end of the Upanishad:

4\. 'Let no one teach this day, the Mahâvrata, to one who is not a
regular pupil (antevâsin), and has been so for one year, certainly not
to one who has not been so for one year; nor to one who is not a
brahma*k*ârin and does not study the same Veda <span
id="fr_688"></span>[1b](#fn_687.md), certainly not to one who does not
study the same Veda; nor to one who does not come to him.

5\. 'Let the teaching not be more than saying it once or twice, twice
only.

6\. 'One man should tell it to one man, so says *G*âtukar*n*ya.

7\. 'Not to a child, nor to a man in his third stage of life.

8\. 'The teacher and pupil should not stand, nor walk, nor lie down, nor
sit on a couch; but they should both sit on the ground.

9\. 'The pupil should not lean backward while learning, nor lean
forward. He should not be covered with too much clothing, nor assume the
postures of a devotee, but without using any of the apparel of a
devotee, simply elevate his knees. Nor should he learn, when he has
eaten flesh, when he has seen blood, or a corpse, or when he has done an
unlawful thing <span id="fr_689"></span>[2b](#fn_688.md); when he has
anointed his eyes, oiled or rubbed his body, when he has been shaved or
bathed, put colour on, or ornamented himself with flower-wreaths, when
he has been writing or effacing his writing <span
id="fr_690"></span>[3b](#fn_689.md).

10\. 'Nor should he finish the reading in one day, so says
*G*âtukar*n*ya, while according to Gâlava, he should finish it in one
day. Âgnive*s*yâyana holds that he should finish all before the
Trikâ*s*îtis <span id="fr_691"></span>[4b](#fn_685.md)

<span id="fn_685"></span>[266:4b](sbe01238.htm#fr_691.md) See Ait. Âr. I,
4, 3, 1-4.

Gautama-sûtras XIV, 21, and Bühler's note.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[266:2b](sbe01238.htm#fr_689.md) Nâvratyam âkramya
is explained by the commentator by u*kkh*ish*t*âdyâkrama*n*a.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[266:3b](sbe01238.htm#fr_690.md) This, if rightly
translated, would seem to be the earliest mention of actual writing in
Sanskrit literature.
