### NINETEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The hiṅkâra is hair, the prastâva skin, the udgîtha flesh, the
pratihâra bone, the nidhana marrow. That is the Ya*g*ñâya*g*ñîya Sâman,
as interwoven in the members of the body.

2\. He who thus knows the Ya*g*ñâya*g*ñîya, as interwoven in the members
of the body, becomes possessed of strong limbs, he is not crippled in
any limb, he reaches the full life, he lives long, becomes great with
children and cattle, great by fame. His rule is, 'Do not eat marrow for
a year,' or 'Do not eat marrow at all.'
