Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THIRTEENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_294"></span>[2](#fn_292).

1\. 'Place this salt in water, and then wait on me in the morning.'

The son did as he was commanded.

The father said to him: 'Bring me the salt, which you placed in the
water last night.'

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

The son having looked for it, found it not, for, of course, it was
melted.

2\. The father said: 'Taste it from the surface of the water. How is
it?'

The son replied: 'It is salt.'

'Taste it from the middle. How is it?'

The son replied: 'It is salt.'

'Taste it from the bottom. How is it?'

The son replied 'It is salt.'

The father said Throw it away <span id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_293) and
then wait on me.'

He did so; but salt exists for ever.

Then the father said: 'Here also, in this body, forsooth, you do not
perceive the True (Sat), my son; but there indeed it is.

3\. 'That which is the subtile essence, in it all that exists has its
self. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O *S*vetaketu, art it.'

'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.

'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_291"></span>[104:1](sbe01130.htm#fr_293) The question which
the son is supposed to have asked is How can this universe which has the
form and name of earth &c. be produced from the Sat which is subtile,
and has neither form nor name?

<span id="fn_292"></span>[104:2](sbe01131.htm#fr_294) The question here
is supposed to have been: If the Sat is the root of all that exists, why
is it not perceived?

<span id="fn_293"></span>[105:1](sbe01131.htm#fr_295) Read abhiprâsya,
which is evidently intended by the commentary: abhiprâsya paritya*g*ya.
