Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THIRD KHA*ND*A.

1\. That man (conceived as uktha) is the sea, rising beyond the whole
world <span id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_554). Whatever he reaches, he
wishes to go beyond <span id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_555). If he reaches
the sky, he wishes to go beyond.

2\. If he should reach that (heavenly) world, he would wish to go
beyond.

3\. That man is fivefold. The heat in him is fire; the apertures (of the
senses) are ether; blood, mucus, and seed are water; the body is earth;
breath is air.

4\. That air is fivefold, viz. up-breathing, down-breathing,
back-breathing, out-breathing, on-breathing. The other powers (devatâs),
viz. sight, hearing, mind, and speech, are comprised under up-breathing
and down-breathing. For when breath departs, they also depart with it.

5\. That man (conceived as uktha) is the sacrifice, which is a
succession now of speech and now of thought. That sacrifice is fivefold,
viz. the Agnihotra, the new and full moon sacrifices, the four-monthly
sacrifices, the animal sacrifice, the Soma sacrifice. The Soma sacrifice
is the most perfect of sacrifices, for in it these five kinds of
ceremonies are seen: the first which precedes the libations (the Dîkshâ,
&c.), then three libations, and what follows (the Avabh*ri*tha, &c.) is
the fifth.
