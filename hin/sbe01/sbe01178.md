### THIRD KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_372"></span>[2](#fn_370).

1\. Brahman obtained the victory for the Devas. The Devas became elated
by the victory of Brahman,

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

and they thought, this victory is ours only, this greatness is ours
only.

2\. Brahman perceived this and appeared to them. But they did not know
it, and said: 'What sprite (yaksha or yakshya) is this?'

3\. They said to Agni (fire): 'O *G*âtavedas, find out what sprite this
is.' 'Yes,' he said.

4\. He ran toward it, and Brahman said to him: 'Who are you?' He
replied: 'I am Agni, I am *G*âtavedas.'

5\. Brahman said: 'What power is in you?' Agni replied: 'I could burn
all whatever there is on earth.'

6\. Brahman put a straw before him, saying: 'Burn this.' He went towards
it with all his might, but he could not burn it. Then he returned thence
and said: 'I could not find out what sprite this is.'

7\. Then they said to Vâyu (air): 'O Vâyu, find out what sprite this
is.' 'Yes,' he said.

8\. He ran toward it, and Brahman said to him: 'Who are you?' He
replied: 'I am Vâyu, I am Mâtari*s*van.'

9\. Brahman said: 'What power is in you?' Vâyu replied: 'I could take up
all whatever there is on earth.'

10\. Brahman put a straw before him, saying: 'Take it up.' He went
towards it with all his might, but he could not take it up. Then he
returned thence and said: 'I could not find out what sprite this is.'

11\. Then they said to Indra: 'O Maghavan, find out what sprite this
is.' He went towards it, but it disappeared from before him.

12\. Then in the same space (ether) he came

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

towards a woman, highly adorned: it was Umâ, the daughter of
Himavat <span id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_371). He said to her: 'Who is
that sprite?'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_370"></span>[149:2](sbe01178.htm#fr_372) This kha*nd*a is
generally represented as a later addition, but its prose style has more
of a Brâhma*n*a character than the verses in the preceding kha*nd*as,
although their metrical structure is irregular, and may be taken as a
sign of antiquity.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[151:1](sbe01178.htm#fr_373) Umâ may here be
taken as the wife of *S*iva, daughter of Himavat, better known by her
earlier name, Pârvatî, the daughter of the mountains. Originally she
was, not the daughter of the mountains or of the Himâlaya, but the
daughter of the cloud, just as Rudra was originally, not the lord of the
mountains, girî*s*a, but the lord of the clouds. We are, however, moving
here in a secondary period of Indian thought, in whi.ch we see, as among
Semitic nations, the manifested powers, and particularly the knowledge
and wisdom of the gods, represented by their wives. Umâ means originally
flax, from vâ, to weave, and the same word may have been an old name of
wife, she who weaves (cf. duhit*ri*; spinster, and possibly wife itself,
if O. H. G. wîb is connected with O. H. G. wëban). It is used almost
synonymously with ambikâ, Taitt. Âr. p. 839. If we wished to take
liberties, we might translate umâ haimavatî by an old woman coming from
the Himavat mountains; but I decline all responsibility for such an
interpretation.
