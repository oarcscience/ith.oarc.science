*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TWENTY-FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'And he who offers the third oblation, should offer it to Apâna
(down-breathing), saying Svâhâ. Then Apâna is satisfied. If Apâna is
satisfied, the tongue is satisfied, if the tongue is satisfied, Agni
(fire) is satisfied, if Agni is satisfied, the earth is satisfied, if
the earth is satisfied, whatever is under the earth and under fire is
satisfied.

2\. 'And through their satisfaction he (the sacrificer or eater) himself
is satisfied with offspring, cattle, health, brightness, and Vedic
splendour.
