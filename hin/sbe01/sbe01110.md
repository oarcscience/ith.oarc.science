<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'The Self which
you meditate on is the Vai*s*vânara Self, called Rayi (wealth).

that Vai*s*vânara Self, eats food and sees his desire, and has Vedic
glory in his house.

'That, however, is but the bladder of the Self, and your bladder would
have burst, if you had not come to me.'
