*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THIRTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Then he said to Satyaya*g*ña Paulushi: 'O Prâ*k*înayogya, whom do
you meditate on as the Self?' He replied: 'The sun only, venerable
king.' He said: 'The Self which you meditate on is the Vai*s*vânara
Self, called Vi*s*varûpa (multiform). Therefore much and manifold wealth
is seen in your house.

2\. 'There is a car with mules, full of slaves and jewels. You eat food
and see your desire, and whoever thus meditates on that Vai*s*vânara
Self, eats food and sees his desire, and has Vedic glory in his house.

'That, however, is but the eye of the Self, and you would have become
blind, if you had not come to me.'
