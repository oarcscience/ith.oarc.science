Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FOURTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_434).

1\. He begins with: 'That indeed was the oldest in the worlds <span
id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_435);'--for that (the Brahman) is verily the
oldest in the worlds.

2\. 'Whence was born the fierce one, endowed with brilliant force;'--for
from it was born the fierce one, who is endowed with brilliant force.

3\. 'When born he at once destroys the enemies;'--for he at once when
born struck down the evil one.

4\. 'He after whom all friends rejoice;'--verily all friends are the
creatures, and they rejoice after him, saying, 'He has risen, he has
risen <span id="fr_438"></span>[3](#fn_436).'

5\. 'Growing by strength, the almighty <span
id="fr_439"></span>[4](#fn_437);'--for he (the sun) does grow by
strength, the almighty.

6\. 'He, as enemy, causes fear to the slave;'--for everything is afraid
of him.

7\. 'Taking the breathing and the not-breathing;'--this means the living
and the lifeless.

8\. 'Whatever has been offered at feasts came to thee;'--this means
everything is in thy power.

9\. 'All turn their thought also on thee <span
id="fr_440"></span>[5](#fn_438);'--this

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

means all these beings, all minds, all thoughts also turn to thee.

10\. 'When these two become three protectors;'--i. e. when these two
united beget offspring.

11\. He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.

12\. 'Join what is sweeter than sweet (offspring) with the sweet (the
parents);'--for the couple (father and mother) is sweet, the offspring
is sweet, and he thus joins the offspring with the couple.

13\. 'And this (the son, when married) being very sweet, conquered
through the sweet;'--i. e. the couple is sweet, the offspring is sweet,
and thus through the couple he conquers offspring <span
id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_439).

14\. This is declared by a *Ri*shi <span
id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_440): 'Because he (Pra*g*âpati) raised his
body (the hymn tad id âsa or the Veda in general) in the body (of the
sacrificer)' (therefore that Nishkevalya hymn is praised);--i. e. this
body, consisting of the Veda, in that corporeal form (of the
sacrificer).

15\. 'Then let this body indeed be the medicine of that body;'--i. e.
this body, consisting of the Veda, of that corporeal form (of the
sacrificer).

16\. Of this (the first foot of Rv. X, 120, 1) the eight syllables are
Gâyatrî, the eleven syllables are Trish*t*ubh, the twelve syllables are
*G*agatî, the ten syllables are Virâ*g*. The Virâ*g*, consisting of ten
syllables, rests in these three metres <span
id="fr_443"></span>[3](#fn_441).

17\. The word purusha, consisting of three syllables, that indeed goes
into the Virâ*g* <span id="fr_444"></span>[4](#fn_442).

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

18\. Verily, these are all metres, these (Gâyatrî, Trish*t*ubh, Gagatî)
having the Virâ*g* as the fourth. In this manner this day is complete in
all metres to him who knows this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_434"></span>[179:1](sbe01191.htm#fr_436) He now explains
the first hymn of the Nishkevalya, which is called the Râ*g*ana.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[179:2](sbe01191.htm#fr_437) Rv. X, 120, 1.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[179:3](sbe01191.htm#fr_438) The sun and the
fire.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[179:4](sbe01191.htm#fr_439) Rv. X, 120, 2.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[179:5](sbe01191.htm#fr_440) Rv. X, 120, 3.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[180:1](sbe01191.htm#fr_441) All these are
purely fanciful interpretations.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[180:2](sbe01191.htm#fr_442) Not to be found in
our *S*âkhâ of the Rig-veda.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[180:3](sbe01191.htm#fr_443) These metres are
obtained by a purely arbitrary counting of syllables in the hymn
tadidâsa, which really consists of Trish*t*ubh verses.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[180:4](sbe01191.htm#fr_444) If we simply count
syllables, the first and second feet of the <span id="page_181">p.
181</span> first verse consist of ten syllables only, the fourth of nine
or ten. In order to bring them to the right number, the word purusha is
to be added to what is a Virâ*g*, i.e. to the first, the second, and
fourth feet. We thus get:

tad id âsa bhuvaneshu *g*yesh*th*am pu  
yato *g*a*g*ña ugras tveshan*ri*m*n*o ru  
sadyo ga*g*ñâno ni ri*n*âti *s*atrûn  
anu ya*m* vi*s*ve madanti ûmâ*h* sha*h*.

Cf. Ait. Âr. V, 1, 6.
