## FIFTH PRAPÂTHAKA <span id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_226).

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. He who knows the oldest and the best becomes himself the oldest and
the best. Breath indeed is the oldest and the best.

2\. He who knows the richest, becomes himself the richest. Speech indeed
is the richest.

3\. He who knows the firm rest, becomes himself firm in this world and
in the next. The eye indeed is the firm rest.

4\. He who knows success, his wishes succeed, both his divine and human
wishes. The ear indeed is success.

5\. He who knows the home, becomes a home of his people. The mind indeed
is the home.

6\. The five senses quarrelled together <span
id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_227), who was the best, saying, I am better,
I am better.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

7\. They went to their father Pra*g*âpati and said: 'Sir, who is the
best of us?' He replied: 'He by whose departure the body seems worse
than worst, he is the best of you.'

8\. The tongue (speech) departed, and having been absent for a year, it
came round and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They
replied: 'Like mute people, not speaking, but breathing with the breath,
seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, thinking with the mind. Thus
we lived.' Then speech went back.

9\. The eye (sight) departed, and having been absent for a year, it came
round and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They
replied: 'Like blind people, not seeing, but breathing with the breath,
speaking with the tongue, hearing with the ear, thinking with the mind.
Thus we lived.' Then the eye went back.

10\. The ear (hearing) departed, and having been absent for a year, it
came round and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They
replied: 'Like deaf people, not hearing, but breathing with the breath,
speaking with the tongue, thinking with the mind. Thus we lived.' Then
the ear went back.

11\. The mind departed, and having been absent for a year, it came round
and said: 'How have you been able to live without me?' They replied:
'Like children whose mind is not yet formed, but breathing with the
breath, speaking with the tongue, seeing with the eye, hearing with the
ear. Thus we lived.' Then the mind went back.

12\. The breath, when on the point of departing, tore up the other
senses, as a horse, going to start,

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

might tear up the pegs to which he is tethered <span
id="fr_229"></span>[1](sbe01096.htm#fn_228). They came to him and said:
'Sir, be thou (our lord); thou art the best among us. Do not depart from
us!'

13\. Then the tongue said to him: 'If I am the richest, thou art the
richest.' The eye said to him: 'If I am the firm rest, thou art the firm
rest <span id="fr_230"></span>[2](sbe01096.htm#fn_229).'

14\. The ear said to him: 'If I am success, thou art success.' The mind
said to him: 'If I am the home, thou art the home.'

15\. And people do not call them, the tongues, the eyes, the ears, the
minds, but the breaths (prâ*n*a, the senses). For breath are all these.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_226"></span>[72:1](sbe01095.htm#fr_227) The chief object is
to show the different ways on which people proceed after death. One of
these ways, the Devapatha that leads to Brahman and from which there is
no return, has been described, IV, 15. The other ways for those who on
earth know the conditioned Brahman only, have to be discussed now.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[72:2](sbe01095.htm#fr_228) The same fable, the
prâ*n*asa*m*vâda or prâ*n*avidyâ, is told in the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka VI,
1, 1-14, the Aitareya Âr. II, 4, the Kaush. Up. III, 3, and the Pra*s*na
Up. II, 3. The last is the simplest version of all, but it does not
follow therefore that it is the oldest. It would be difficult to find
two fables apparently more alike, yet in reality differing from each
other more characteristically than this fable and the fable told to the
plebeians by Menenius Agrippa.
