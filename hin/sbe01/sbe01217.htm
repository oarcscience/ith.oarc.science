<p>1. He who knows one sacrifice above another, one day above another, one deity above the others, he is clever. Now this great uktha (the nishkevalya-<I>s</I>astra) is the sacrifice above another, the day above another, the deity above others&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_558"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>2. This uktha is fivefold. With regard to its being performed as a Stoma (chorus), it is Triv<I>ri</I>t, Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a, Saptada<I>s</I>a, Ekavi<I>m</I>sa, and Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>avi<I>m</I>sa. With regard to its being performed as a S&acirc;man (song), it is G&acirc;yatra, Rathantara, B<I>ri</I>hat, Bhadra, and R&acirc;gana. With regard to metre, it is G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, Ush<I>n</I>ih, B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;, Trish<I>t</I>ubh, and Dvipad&acirc;. And the explanation (given before in the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka) is that it is the head, the right wing, the left wing, the tail, and the body of the bird&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_557"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

 in each hymn. This, is the first round. He then sings the three middle verses in each hymn. This is the second round. He lastly sings the last three verses in each hymn. This is the third round. This song is called Udyat&icirc;.</p>  
<p>The Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a stoma is formed out of one S&ucirc;kta only, consisting of three verses. In the first round he sings the first verse <a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 225</font></A> three times, the second and third once. In the second round he sings the middle verse three times, in the third round he sings the last verse three times. This song is called Vish<I>t</I>uti.</p>  
<p>The Saptadasa stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round he sings the first verse three times, in the second the middle verse three times, in the third round the middle and last verses three times. This song is called Da<I>s</I>asapta.</p>  
<p>The Ekavi<I>m</I>sa stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round he sings the last verse once, in the second the first verse once, in the third the middle verse once, while the other verses are each repeated three times. This song is called Saptasaptin&icirc;.</p>  
<p>The Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>avi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a stoma is formed in the same manner, only that in the first round he sings the first verse three times, the second four times, the last once; in the second round the first once, the second three times, the third four times; in the third round the first five times, the second once, the last three times; or he sings in the third round the first verse four times, the second twice, the last three times.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a in his commentary on the Ait. &Acirc;r. takes the Triv<I>ri</I>t stoma to be formed out of three hymns, each consisting of three verses, while he says that the other stomas are formed out of one hymn only. B. and R., s<I>v</I>. triv<I>ri</I>t, state that this stoma consists of verses 1, 4, 7; 2, 5, 8; and 3, 6, 9 of the Rig-veda hymn IX, 11, but, according to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, the stoma consists (1) of the first verses of the three S&ucirc;ktas, up&acirc;smai g&acirc;yata, davidyutaty&acirc;, and pavam&acirc;nasya at the beginning of the S&acirc;ma-veda-Uttar&acirc;r<I>k</I>ika, (2) of the second, (3) Of the third verses of the same three hymns. Mah&icirc;dh&acirc;ra (Yv. X, 9) takes the same view, though the MSS. seem to have left out the description of the second pary&acirc;ya, while S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a in his commentary to the T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a seems to support the opinion of B. and R. There is an omission, however, in the printed text of the commentary, which makes it difficult to see the exact meaning of S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>The Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a stoma is well described by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya Br. II, 4. Taking the S&ucirc;kta agna &acirc; y&acirc;hi (Uttar&acirc;r<I>k</I>ika I, 1, 4 = Rv. VI, 16, 10-12), he shows the stoma to consist of (1) verse 1 &times; 3, 2, 3 (2) verse 1, 2 &times; 3, 3; (3) verse 1, 2, 3 &times; 3.</p>  
<p>The five S&acirc;mans are explained by the commentator. The <a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="green">p. 226</font></A> G&acirc;yatra is formed out of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> (III, 62, 10) tat savitur vare<I>n</I>yam. The Rathantara is formed out of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> (VII, 32, 22) abhi tv&acirc; <I>s</I>&ucirc;ra nonuma. The B<I>ri</I>hat is formed out of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> (VI, 46, 1) tv&acirc;m id dhi hav&acirc;mahe. The Bhadra is formed out of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> (X, 57, 1) im&acirc; nu kam. The R&acirc;<I>g</I>ana is formed out of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> (VII, 27, 1) indram naro nemadhit&acirc;.</p>  
<p>The metres require no explanation.</p>  
<p>In identifying certain portions of the Nishkevalya hymn with a bird, the head of the bird corresponds to the hymns indram id g&acirc;thina<I>h</I>, &amp;c.; the right wing to the hymns abhi tv&acirc; <I>s</I>&ucirc;ra, &amp;c.; the left wing to the hymns tv&acirc;m id dhi, &amp;c.; the tail to the hymns im&acirc; nu kam, &amp;c.; the body to the hymns tad id &acirc;sa, &amp;c. All this was explained in the first &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka.</p>

All this together forms one thousand Stobhas, or musical syllables&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_562"></A><A HREF="#fn_560"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>4. Thus also are the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> verses, contained in the Nishkevalya, recited (by the Hot<I>ri</I>) in five orders. What precedes the eighty t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as, that is one order, then follow the three sets of eighty t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as each, and what comes after is the fifth order&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_563"></A><A HREF="#fn_561"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>5. This (the hymns of this Sastra) as a whole (if properly counted with the Stobha syllables) comes to one thousand (of B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; verses). That (thousand) is the whole, and ten, ten is called the whole. For number is such (measured by ten). Ten tens are a hundred, ten hundreds are a thousand, and that is the whole. These are the three metres (the tens, pervading everything). And this food also (the three sets of hymns being represented as food) is threefold, eating, drinking, and chewing. He obtains that food by those (three numbers, ten, hundred, and thousand, or by the three sets of eighty t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_556"></A><A HREF="sbe01217.htm#fr_558">224:1</A> The uktha is to be conceived as pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, breath or life, and this pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a was shown to be above the other powers (devat&acirc;s), speech, hearing, seeing, mind. The uktha belongs to the Mah&acirc;vrata day, and that is the most important day of the Soma sacrifice. The Soma sacrifice, lastly, is above all other sacrifices.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_557"></A><A HREF="sbe01217.htm#fr_559">224:2</A> All these are technicalities connected with the singing and reciting of the uktha. The commentator says: The stoma is a collection of single <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> verses occurring in the t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as which have to be sung. The Triv<I>ri</I>t stoma, as explained in the S&acirc;ma-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, is as follows: There are three S&ucirc;ktas, each consisting of three verses, the first being up&acirc;smai g&acirc;yata, S. V. Uttar&acirc;r<I>k</I>ika I, 1, 1 = Rv. IX, 11. The Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> first sings the first three verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>

<P><A NAME="fn_559"></A><A HREF="sbe01217.htm#fr_561">226:1</A> The S&acirc;magas sing the R&acirc;<I>g</I>ana at the Mah&acirc;vrata, and in that S&acirc;man there are, as usual, five parts, the Prast&acirc;va, Udg&icirc;tha, pratih&acirc;ra, Upadrava, and Nidhana. The Prastot<I>ri</I>, when singing the Prast&acirc;va portions, sings them five times. The Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> and Pratihart<I>ri</I> sing their portions, the Udg&icirc;tha and Pratih&acirc;ra, five times. The Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> again sings the Upadrava five times. And all the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s together sing the Nidhana five times.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_560"></A><A HREF="sbe01217.htm#fr_562">226:2</A> The Stobha syllables are syllables without any meaning, added when verses have to be sung, in order to have a support for the music. See <I>Kh</I>. Up. I, 13. In singing the five S&acirc;mans, each five times, one thousand of such Stobha syllables are required.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_561"></A><A HREF="sbe01217.htm#fr_563">226:3</A> There are in the Nishkevalya hymn, which the Hot<I>ri</I> has to recite, three sets of eighty t<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as each. The first, consisting of G&acirc;yatr&icirc;s, begins with <A NAME="img_22600"></A>

The hymns <a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="green">p. 227</font></A> which precede these, form the body, head, and wings of the bird. This is one order.
