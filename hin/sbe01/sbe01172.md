### TWELFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Maghavat, this body is mortal and always held by death. It is the
abode of that Self which is

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

immortal and without body <span id="fr_355"></span>[1](#fn_353.md). When in
the body (by thinking this body is I and I am this body) the Self is
held by pleasure and pain. So long as he is in the body, he cannot get
free from pleasure and pain. But when he is free of the body (when he
knows himself different from the body), then neither pleasure nor pain
touches him <span id="fr_356"></span>[2](#fn_354.md).

2\. 'The wind is without body, the cloud, lightning, and thunder are
without body (without hands, feet, &c.) Now as these, arising from this
heavenly ether (space), appear in their own form, as soon as they have
approached the highest light,

3\. 'Thus does that serene being, arising from this body, appear in its
own form, as soon as it has approached the highest light (the knowledge
of Self <span id="fr_357"></span>[3](#fn_355)) He (in that state.md) is the
highest person (uttama pûrusha). He moves about there laughing (or
eating), playing, and rejoicing (in his mind), be it with women,
carriages, or relatives, never minding that body into which he was
born <span id="fr_358"></span>[4](#fn_356.md).

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

'Like as a horse attached to a cart, so is the spirit <span
id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_357) (prâ*n*a, pra*g*ñâtman.md) attached to this
body.

4\. 'Now where the sight has entered into the void (the open space, the
black pupil of the eye), there is the person of the eye, the eye itself
is the instrument of seeing. He who knows, let me smell this, he is the
Self, the nose is the instrument of smelling. He who knows, let me say
this, he is the Self, the tongue is the instrument of saying. He who
knows, let me hear this, he is the Self, the ear is the instrument of
hearing.

5\. 'He who knows, let me think this, he is the Self, the mind is his
divine eye <span id="fr_360"></span>[2](#fn_358.md). He, the Self, seeing
these pleasures (which to others are hidden like a buried treasure of
gold) through his divine eye, i. e. the mind, rejoices.

'The Devas who are in the world of Brahman meditate on that Self (as
taught by Pra*g*âpati to Indra, and by Indra to the Devas). Therefore
all worlds belong to them, and all desires. He who knows that Self and
understands it, obtains all worlds and all desires.' Thus said
Pra*g*âpati, yea, thus said Pra*g*âpati.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_353"></span>[141:1](sbe01172.htm#fr_355.md) According to some,
the body is the result of the Self, the elements of the body, fire,
water, and earth springing from the Self, and the Self afterwards
entering them.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[141:2](sbe01172.htm#fr_356.md) Ordinary, worldly
pleasure. Comm.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[141:3](sbe01172.htm#fr_357.md) The simile is not
so striking as most of those old similes are. The wind is compared with
the Self, on account of its being for a time lost in the ether (space),
as the Self is in the body, and then rising again out of the ether and
assuming its own form as wind. The chief stress is laid on the highest
light, which in the one case is the sun of summer, in the other the
light of knowledge.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[141:4](sbe01172.htm#fr_358.md) These are
pleasures which seem hardly compatible with the state of perfect peace
which the Self is supposed to have attained. The passage may be
interpolated, or put in on purpose to show that the Self enjoys such
pleasures as an inward spectator only, without identifying himself with
either pleasure or pain. He sees them, as he says afterwards, with his
divine eye. The Self perceives <span id="page_142">p. 142</span> in all
things his Self only, nothing else. In his commentary on the Taittîrya
Upanishad (p. 45) *S*aṅkara refers this passage to Brahman as an effect,
not to Brahman as a cause.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[142:1](sbe01172.htm#fr_359.md) The spirit, the
conscious self, is not identical with the body, but only joined to it,
like a horse, or driving it, like a charioteer. In other passages the
senses are the horses; buddhi, reason, the charioteer; manas, mind, the
reins. The spirit is attached to the cart by the *k*etana; cf.
Ânanda*g*ñânagiri.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[142:2](sbe01172.htm#fr_360.md) Because it
perceives not only what is present, but also what is past and future.
