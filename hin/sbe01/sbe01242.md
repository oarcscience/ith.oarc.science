### FOURTH ADHYÂYA <span id="fr_755"></span>[1](#fn_753.md)

1\. There was formerly Gârgya Bâlâki <span
id="fr_756"></span>[2](#fn_754.md), famous as a man of great reading; for
it was said of him that he lived among the U*s*înaras, among the
Satvat-Matsyas, the Kuru-Pañ*k*âlas, the Kâ*s*î-Videhas <span
id="fr_757"></span>[3](#fn_755.md). Having gone to A*g*âta*s*atru, (the
king) of Kâ*s*î, he said to him: 'Shall I tell you Brahman?'
A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'We give a thousand (cows) for that speech
(of yours), for verily all people run away, saying, "*G*anaka (the king
of Mithilâ) is our father (patron)."'

3\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the sun, on him I meditate (as
Brahman).'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'No, no! do not challenge me (to a
disputation) on this <span id="fr_759"></span>[1](#fn_757.md). I meditate
on him who is called great, clad in white raiment <span
id="fr_760"></span>[2](#fn_758.md), the supreme, the head of all beings.
Whoso meditates

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

on him thus, becomes supreme, and the head of all beings.'

4\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the moon, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as Soma, the king, the self, (source) of all food. Whoso meditates
on him thus, becomes the self, (source) of all food.'

5\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the lightning, on him I
meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as the self in light. Whoso meditates on him thus, becomes the self
in light.'

6\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the thunder, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as the self of sound <span id="fr_761"></span>[1](#fn_759.md). Whoso
meditates on him thus, becomes the self of sound.'

7\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the ether, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as the full, quiescent Brahman. Whoso meditates on him thus, is
filled with offspring and cattle. Neither he himself nor his offspring
dies before the time.'

8\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the air, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as Indra Vaiku*nth*a, as the unconquerable army. Whoso meditates on
him thus, becomes victorious, unconquerable, conquering his enemies.'

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

9\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the fire, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as powerful. Whoso meditates on him thus, becomes powerful among
others <span id="fr_762"></span>[1](#fn_760.md).'

10\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the water, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as the self of the name. Whoso meditates on him thus, becomes the
self of the name.' So far with regard to deities (mythological); now
with regard to the body (physiological).

11\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the mirror, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as the likeness. Whoso meditates on him thus, to him a son is born
in his family who is his likeness, not one who is not his likeness.'

12\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the echo, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as the second, who never goes away. Whoso meditates on him thus, he
gets a second from his second (his wife), he becomes doubled <span
id="fr_763"></span>[2](#fn_761.md).

Bâlâki said: 'The sound that follows a man, on that I meditate.

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

this. I meditate on him as life. Whoso meditates on him thus, neither he
himself nor his offspring will faint before the time.'

14\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the shadow, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as death. Whoso meditates on him thus, neither he himself nor his
offspring will die before the time.'

15\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is embodied, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as Lord of creatures. Whose, meditates on him thus, is multiplied in
offspring and cattle.'

16\. Bâlâki said: 'The Self which is conscious (prâ*g*ña), and by whom
he who sleeps here, walks about in sleep, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as Yama the king. Whoso meditates on him thus, everything is subdued
for his excellencies.'

17\. Bâlâki said: 'The person that is in the right eye, on him I
meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as the self of the name, as the self of fire, as the self of
splendour. Whoso meditates on him thus, he becomes the self of these.'

18\. Bâlâki said The person that is in the left eye, on him I meditate.'

A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Do not challenge me on this. I meditate on
him as the self of the true, as the self of lightning, as the self of
light. Whoso

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

meditates on him thus, he becomes the self of these.'

19\. After this Bâlâki became silent. A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Thus
far only (do you know), O Bâlâki?' 'Thus far only,' replied Bâlâki.

Then A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Vainly did you challenge me, saying:
'Shall I tell you Brahman? O Bâlâki, he who is the maker of those
persons (whom you mentioned), he of whom all this is the work, he alone
is to be known.'

Thereupon Bâlâki came, carrying fuel in his hand, saying: 'May I come to
you as a pupil?' A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'I deem it improper that a
Kshatriya should initiate a Brâhma*n*a. Come, I shall make you know
clearly.' Then taking him by the hand, he went forth. And the two
together came to a person who was asleep. And A*g*âta*s*atru called him,
saying: 'Thou great one, clad in white raiment, Soma, King <span
id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_762.md).' But he remained lying. Then he pushed
him with a stick, and he rose at once. Then said A*g*âta*s*atru to him:
'Bâlâki, where did this person here sleep? Where was he? Whence came he
thus back?' Bâlâki did not know.

20\. And A*g*âta*s*atru said to him: 'Where this person here slept,
where he was, whence he thus came back, is this: The arteries of the
heart called Hita extend from the heart of the person towards the
surrounding body. Small as a hair divided a thousand times, they stand
full of a thin fluid of various colours, white, black, yellow, red. In
these the person is when sleeping he sees no dream.

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

Then he becomes one with that prâ*n*a alone. Then speech goes to him
with all names, the eye with all forms, the car with all sounds, the
mind with all thoughts. And when he awakes, then, as from a burning
fire, sparks proceed in all directions, thus from that self the prâ*n*as
(speech, &c.) proceed, each towards its place, from the prâ*n*as the
gods, from the gods the worlds. And as a razor might be fitted in a
razor-case, or as fire in the fire-place (the ara*n*i on the altar),
even thus this conscious self enters the self of the body (considers the
body as himself) to the very hairs and nails. And the other selfs (such
as speech, &c.) follow that self, as his people follow the master of the
house. And as the master feeds with his people, nay, as his people feed
on the master, thus does this conscious self feed with the other selfs,
as a master with his people, and the other selfs follow him, as his
people follow the master. So long as Indra did not understand that self,
the Asuras conquered him. When he understood it, he conquered the Asuras
and obtained the pre-eminence among all gods, sovereignty, supremacy.
And thus also he who knows this obtains pre-eminence among all beings,
sovereignty, supremacy,--yea, he who knows this.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_753"></span>[300:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_755.md) Prâ*n*a, breath or
life, has been explained in the preceding chapter. But this prâ*n*a is
not yet the highest point that has to be reached. Prâ*n*a, life, even as
united with pra*g*ñâ, consciousness, is only a covering of something
else, viz. the Self, and this Highest Self has now to be explained.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[300:2](sbe01242.htm#fr_756.md) The same story is
told in the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka II, 1 seq., but with important
variations.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[300:3](sbe01242.htm#fr_757.md) I take iti to
depend on sa*m*spash*t*a, and read satvanmatsyeshu, though the
commentary seems to have read so 'vasan, or sa vasan, for savasan. See
Introduction, p. lxxvii.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[300:4](sbe01242.htm#fr_758.md) The second
paragraph forms a kind of table of contents for the discussion which is
to follow. I have given instead a fuller table of contents, taken from
the Brihad-âra*n*yaka II, as compared with the Kaushîtaki-upanishad in
its two texts. The variations of text A are given in small letters. In
text B, the table of contents is given at the end of the discussion, in
§ 18.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[302:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_759.md) The king means to
say that he knows this already, and that he can mention not only the
predicates of the person in the sun thus meditated on as Brahman, but
also the rewards of such meditation.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[302:2](sbe01242.htm#fr_760.md) This is properly a
predicate of the moon, and used as such in the
B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka-upanishad, in the second paragraph of the dialogue.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[303:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_761.md) This is not
mentioned in the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[304:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_762.md) Instead of
anyeshu, the second text, as printed by Professor Cowell, has anv esha.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[304:2](sbe01242.htm#fr_763.md) This paragraph
does not occur in the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka.

<span id="fn_762"></span>[306:1](sbe01242.htm#fr_764.md) See § 3 init.
