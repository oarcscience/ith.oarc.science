Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## THIRD ADHYÂYA <span id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_548.md).

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. He who knows himself as the fivefold hymn (uktha), the emblem of
Prâ*n*a (breath), from whence all this springs <span
id="fr_551"></span>[2](#fn_549.md), he is clever. These five are the earth,
air, ether, water, and fire (*g*yotis). This is the self, the fivefold
uktha. For from him all this springs, and into him it enters again (at
the dissolution of the world). He who knows this, becomes the refuge of
his friends.

2\. And to him who knows the food (object) and the feeder (subject) in
that uktha, a strong son is born, and food is never wanting. Water and
earth are food, for all food consists of these two. Fire and air are the
feeder, for by means of them <span id="fr_552"></span>[3](#fn_550.md) man
eats all food. Ether is the bowl, for all this is poured into the ether.
He who knows this, becomes the bowl or support of his friends.

3\. To him who knows the food and the feeder in that uktha, a strong son
is born, and food is never wanting. Herbs and trees are food, animals
the feeder, for animals eat herbs and trees.

4\. Of them again those who have teeth above

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

and below, shaped after the likeness of man, are feeders, the other
animals are food. Therefore these overcome the other animals, for the
eater is over the food.

5\. He who knows this is over his friends.
