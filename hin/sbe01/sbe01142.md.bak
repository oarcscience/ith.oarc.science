*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### EIGHTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Power (bala) is better than understanding. One powerful man shakes
a hundred men of understanding. If a man is powerful, he becomes a
rising man. If he rises, he becomes a man who visits wise people. If he
visits, he becomes a follower of wise people. If he follows them, he
becomes a seeing, a hearing, a perceiving, a knowing, a doing, an
understanding man. By power the earth stands firm, and the sky, and the
heaven, and the mountains, gods and men, cattle, birds, herbs, trees,
all beasts down to worms, midges, and ants; by power the world stands
firm. Meditate on power.

2\. 'He who meditates on power as Brahman, is, as it were, lord and
master as far as power reaches--he who meditates on power as Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than power?'

'Yes, there is something better than power.'

'Sir, tell it me.'
