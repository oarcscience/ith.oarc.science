## SECOND ADHYÂYA <span id="fr_654"></span>[1](#fn_652.md).

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Sthavira *S*âkalya said that breath is the beam <span
id="fr_655"></span>[2](#fn_653.md), and as the other beams rest on the
house-beam, thus the eye, the ear, the mind, the speech, the senses, the
body, the whole self rests on this <span id="fr_656"></span>[3](#fn_654.md)
breath.

2\. Of that self the breathing is like the sibilants, the bones like the
mutes, the marrow like the vowels, and the fourth part, flesh, blood,
and the rest, like the semivowels <span
id="fr_657"></span>[4](#fn_655.md),--so said Hrasva Mâ*nd*ûkeya.

3\. To us it was said to be a triad only <span
id="fr_658"></span>[5](#fn_656.md).

4\. Of that triad, viz. bones, marrow, and joints, there are 360 (parts)
on this side (the right), and 360 on that side (the left). They make 720
together, and 720 <span id="fr_659"></span>[6](#fn_657.md) are the days and
nights of the year. Thus that self which consists of sight, hearing,
metre, mind, and speech is like unto the days.

5\. He who thus knows this self, which consists of sight, hearing,
metre, mind, and speech, as like unto the days, obtains union, likeness,
or nearness with the days, has sons and cattle, and lives his full age.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_652"></span>[257:1](sbe01233.htm#fr_654.md) In the first
adhyâya meditations suggested by sa*m*hitâ, pada, and krama have been
discussed. Now follow meditations suggested by certain classes of
letters.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[257:2](sbe01233.htm#fr_655.md) Ait. Âr. III, 1,
4.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[257:3](sbe01233.htm#fr_656.md) The Kashmir MS.
reads etasmin prâ*n*e. The self here is meant for the body, and yet it
seems to be different from *s*arîra.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[257:4](sbe01233.htm#fr_657.md) The Kashmir MS.
writes antastha without visarga, while it is otherwise most careful in
writing all sibilants.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[257:5](sbe01233.htm#fr_658.md) *S*âkalya, as we
saw, told his disciples that there were three classes only, not four.
Comm. The Kashmir MS. reads traya*m* tv eva na ityetat proktam.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[257:6](sbe01233.htm#fr_659.md) The Kashmir MS,
reads sapta vi*ms*ati*s* *k*a *s*atâni.
