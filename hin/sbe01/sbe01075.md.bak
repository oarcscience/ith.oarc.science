*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SEVENTEENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_186.md).

1\. When a man (who is the sacrificer) hungers, thirsts, and abstains
from pleasures, that is the Dîkshâ (initiatory rite).

2\. When a man eats, drinks, and enjoys pleasures, he does it with the
Upasadas (the sacrificial days on which the sacrificer is allowed to
partake of food).

3\. When a man laughs, eats, and delights himself, he does it with the
Stuta-*s*astras (hymns sung and recited at the sacrifices).

4\. Penance, liberality, righteousness, kindness, truthfulness, these
form his Dakshi*n*âs (gifts bestowed on priests, &c.)

5\. Therefore when they say, 'There will be a

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

birth,' and 'there has been a birth' (words used at the Soma-sacrifice,
and really meaning, 'He will pour out the Soma-juice,' and 'he has
poured out the Soma-juice'), that is his new birth. His death is the
Avabh*ri*tha ceremony (when the sacrificial Vessels are carried away to
be cleansed).

6\. Ghora Âṅgirasa, after having communicated this (view of the
sacrifice) to K*ri*sh*n*a, the son of Devăkî <span
id="fr_188"></span>[1](#fn_187.md)--and he never thirsted again (after
other knowledge)--said: 'Let a man, when his end approaches,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

take refuge with this Triad <span id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_188.md): "Thou
art the imperishable," "Thou art the unchangeable," "Thou art the edge
of Prâ*n*a."' On this subject there are two *Rik* verses (Rig-veda VIII,
6, 30):--

7\. 'Then they see (within themselves) the ever-present light of the old
seed (of the world, the Sat), the highest, which is lighted in the
brilliant (Brahman).' Rig-veda I, 50, 10:--

'Perceiving above the darkness (of ignorance) the higher light (in the
sun), as the higher light within the heart, the bright source (of light
and life) among the gods, we have reached the highest light, yea, the
highest light <span id="fr_190"></span>[2](#fn_189.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_186"></span>[51:1](sbe01075.htm#fr_187.md) Here we have a
representation of the sacrifice as performed without any ceremonial, and
as it is often represented when performed in thought only by a man
living in the forest.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[52:1](sbe01075.htm#fr_188.md) The curious
coincidence between K*ri*sh*n*a Devakîputra, here mentioned as a pupil
of Ghora Âṅgirasa, and the famous K*ri*sh*n*a, the son of Devakî, was
first pointed out by Colebrooke, Miscell. Essays, II, 177. Whether it is
more than a coincidence, is difficult to say. Certainly we can build no
other conclusions on it than those indicated by Colebrooke, that new
fables may have been constructed elevating this personage to the rank of
a god. We know absolutely nothing of the old K*ri*sh*n*a Devakîputra
except his having been a pupil of Ghora Âṅgirasa, nor does there seem to
have been any attempt made by later Brahmans to connect their divine
K*ri*sh*n*a, the son of Vasudeva, with the K*ri*sh*n*a Devakîputra of
our Upanishad. This is all the more remarkable because the author of the
Sâ*nd*ilya-sûtras, for instance, who is very anxious to find a *s*rauta
authority for the worship of K*ri*sh*n*a Vâsudeva as the supreme deity,
had to be satisfied with quoting such modern compilations as the
Nârâya*n*opanishad, Atharva*s*iras, VI, 9, brahma*n*yo devakîputro,
brahmanyo madhusûdana*h* (see Sâ*nd*ilya-sûtras, ed. Ballantyne, p. 36,
translated by Cowell, p. 51), without venturing to refer to the
K*ri*sh*n*a Devakîputra of the Khândogya-upanishad. The occurrence of
such names as K*ri*sh*n*a, Vâsudeva, Madhusûdanah stamps Upanishads,
like the Âtmabodha-upanishad, as modern (Colebrooke, Essays, 1, 101),
and the same remark applies, as Weber has shown, to the
Gopâlatâpanî-upanishad (Bibliotheca Indica, No. 183), where we actually
find such names as *S*rîk*ri*sh*n*a Govinda, Gopî*g*anavallabha,
Devakyâm gâtâ*h* (p. 38), &c. Professor Weber has treated these
questions very fully, but it is not quite clear to me whether he wishes
to go beyond Colebrooke and to admit more than a similarity of name
between the pupil of Ghora Âṅgirasa and the friend of the Gopîs.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[53:1](sbe01075.htm#fr_189.md) Let him recite
these three verses.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[53:2](sbe01075.htm#fr_190.md) Both these verses
had to be translated here according to their scholastic interpretation,
but they had originally a totally different meaning. Even the text was
altered, divâ being changed to divi, sva*h* to sve. The first is taken
from a hymn addressed to Indra, who after conquering the dark clouds
brings back the light of the sun. When he does that, then the people see
again, as the poet says, the daily light of the old seed (from which the
sun rises) which is lighted in heaven. The other verse belongs to a hymn
addressed to the sun. Its simple meaning. is: 'Seeing above the darkness
(of the night) the rising light, the Sun, bright among the bright, we
came towards the highest light.'
