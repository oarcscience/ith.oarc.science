# INTRODUCTION

# TO

# THE UPANISHADS.

##### FIRST TRANSLATION OF THE UPANISHADS.

##### DÂRÂ SHUKOH, ANQUETIL DUPERRON, SCHOPENHAUER.

THE ancient Vedic literature, the foundation of the whole literature of
India, which has been handed down in that country in an unbroken
succession from the earliest times within the recollection of man to the
present day, became known for the first time beyond the frontiers of
India through the Upanishads. The Upanishads were translated from
Sanskrit into Persian by, or, it may be, for Dârâ Shukoh, the eldest son
of Shâh Jehân, an enlightened prince, who openly professed the liberal
religious tenets of the great Emperor Akbar, and even wrote a book
intended to reconcile the religious doctrines of Hindus and Mohammedans.
He seems first to have heard of the Upanishads during his stay in
Kashmir in 1640. He afterwards invited several Pandits from Benares to
Delhi, who were to assist him in the work of translation. The
translation was finished in 1657. Three years after the accomplishment
of this work, in 1659, the prince was put to death by his brother
Aurangzib <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md), in reality, no doubt,
because he was the eldest son and legitimate successor of Shâh Jehân,
but under the pretext that he was an infidel, and dangerous to the
established religion of the empire.

When the Upanishads had once been translated from Sanskrit into Persian,
at that time the most widely read language of the East and understood
likewise by many European scholars, they became generally accessible to

<span id="page_lviii">p. lviii</span>

all who took an interest in the religious literature of India. It is
true that under Akbar's reign (1556-1586) similar translations had been
prepared <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md), but neither those nor the
translations of Dârâ Shukoh attracted the attention of European scholars
till the year 1775. In that year Anquetil Duperron, the famous traveller
and discoverer of the Zend-avesta, received one MS. of the Persian
translation of the Upanishads, sent to him by M. Gentil, the French
resident at the court of Shuja ud daula, and brought to France by M.
Bernier. After receiving another MS., Anquetil Duperron collated the
two, and translated the Persian translation <span
id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16) into French (not published.md), and into
Latin. That Latin translation was published in 1801 and 1802, under the
title of 'Oupnek'hat, id est, Secretum tegendum: opus ipsa in India
rarissimum, continens antiquam et arcanam, seu theologicam et
philosophicam doctrinam, e quatuor sacris Indorum libris Rak baid,
Djedjer baid, Sam baid, Athrban baid excerptam; ad verbum, e Persico
idiomate, Samkreticis vocabulis intermixto, in Latinum conversum:
Dissertationibus et Annotationibus difficiliora explanantibus,
illustratum: studio et opera Anquetil Duperron, Indicopleustæ.
Argentorati, typis et impensis fratrum Levrault, vol. i, 1801; vol. ii,
1802 <span id="fr_17"></span>[3](#fn_17.md).'

This translation, though it attracted considerable interest among
scholars, was written in so utterly unintelligible a style, that it
required the lynxlike perspicacity of an intrepid

<span id="page_lix">p. lix</span>

philosopher, such as Schopenhauer, to discover a thread through such a
labyrinth. Schopenhauer, however, not only found and followed such a
thread, but he had the courage to proclaim to an incredulous age the
vast treasures of thought which were lying buried beneath that fearful
jargon.

As Anquetil Duperron's volumes have become scarce, I shall here give a
short specimen of his translation, which corresponds to the first
sentences of my translation of the *Kh*ândogya-upanishad (p. 1):--'Oum
hoc verbum (esse) adkit ut sciveris, sic τὸ maschghouli fac (de co
meditare), quod ipsum hoc verbum aodkit est; propter illud quod hoc
(verbum) oum, in Sam Beid, cum voce altâ, cum harmoniâ pronunciatum
fiat.

'Adkiteh porro cremor (optimum, selectissimum) est: quemadmodum ex (præ)
omni quieto (non moto), et moto, pulvis (terra) cremor (optimum) est; et
e (præ) terra aqua cremor est; et ex aqua, comedendum (victus) cremor
est; (et) e comedendo, comedens cremor est; et e comedente, loquela (id
quod dicitur) cremor est; et e loquela, aïet τοῦ Beid, et ex aïet, τὸ
siam, id est, cum harmonia (pronunciatum); et e Sam, τὸ adkit, cremor
est; id est, oum, voce alta, cum harmonia pronunciare, aokit, cremor
cremorum (optimum optimorum) est. Major, ex (præ) adkit, cremor alter
non est.'

Schopenhauer not only read this translation carefully, but he makes no
secret of it, that his own philosophy is powerfully impregnated by the
fundamental doctrines of the Upanishads. He dwells on it again and
again, and it seems both fair to Schopenhauer's memory and highly
important for a true appreciation of the philosophical value of the
Upanishads, to put together what that vigorous thinker has written on
those ancient rhapsodies of truth.

In his 'Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,' he writes, in the preface to
the first edition, p. xiii:

'If the reader has also received the benefit of the Vedas, the access to
which by means of the Upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege
which this still young century (1818) may claim before all previous
centuries, (for I anticipate that the influence of Sanskrit literature
will not be less profound

<span id="page_lx">p. lx</span>

than the revival of Greek in the fourteenth century,)--if then the
reader, I say, has received his initiation in primeval Indian wisdom,
and received it with an open heart, he will be prepared in the very best
way for hearing what I have to tell him. It will not sound to him
strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it
did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached
statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a
necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to
enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be
found there.'

And again <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md):

'If I consider how difficult it is, even with the assistance of the best
and carefully educated teachers, and with all the excellent philological
appliances collected in the course of this century, to arrive at a
really correct, accurate, and living understanding of Greek and Roman
authors, whose language was after all the language of our own
predecessors in Europe, and the mother of our own, while Sanskrit, on
the contrary, was spoken thousands of years ago in distant India, and
can be learnt only with appliances which are as yet very imperfect;--if
I add to this the impression which the translations of Sanskrit works by
European scholars, with very few exceptions, produce on my mind, I
cannot resist a certain suspicion that our Sanskrit scholars do not
understand their texts much better than the higher class of schoolboys
their Greek. Of course, as they are not boys, but men of knowledge and
understanding, they put together, out of what they do understand,
something like what the general meaning may have been, but much probably
creeps in ex ingenio. It is still worse with the Chinese of our European
Sinologues.

'If then I consider, on the other hand, that Sultan Mohammed Dârâ
Shukoh, the brother of Aurangzib, was born and bred in India, was a
learned, thoughtful, and enquiring man, and therefore probably
understood his Sanskrit about as well as we our Latin, that moreover

<span id="page_lxi">p. lxi</span>

he was assisted by a number of the most learned Pandits, all this
together gives me at once a very high opinion of his translation of the
Vedic Upanishads into Persian. If, besides this, I see with what
profound and quite appropriate reverence Anquetil Duperron has treated
that Persian translation, rendering it in Latin word by word, retaining,
in spite of Latin grammar, the Persian syntax, and all the Sanskrit
words which the Sultan himself had left untranslated, though explaining
them in a glossary, I feel the most perfect confidence in reading that
translation, and that confidence soon receives its most perfect
justification. For how entirely does the Oupnekhat breathe throughout
the holy spirit of the Vedas! How is every one who by a diligent study
of its Persian Latin has become familiar with that incomparable book,
stirred by that spirit to the very depth of his soul! How does every
line display its firm, definite, and throughout harmonious meaning! From
every sentence deep, original, and sublime thoughts arise, and the whole
is pervaded by a high and holy and earnest spirit. Indian air surrounds
us, and original thoughts of kindred spirits. And oh, how thoroughly is
the mind here washed clean of all early engrafted Jewish superstitions,
and of all philosophy that cringes before those superstitions! In the
whole world there is no study, except that of the originals, so
beneficial and so elevating as that of the Oupnekhat. It has been the
solace of my life, it will be the solace of my death!

'Though <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) I feel the highest regard
for the religious and philosophical works of Sanskrit literature, I have
not been able to derive much pleasure from their poetical compositions.
Nay, they seem to me sometimes as tasteless and monstrous as the
sculpture of India.

'In <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20.md) most of the pagan philosophical
writers of the first Christian centuries we see the Jewish theism,
which, as Christianity, was soon to become the faith of the people,
shining through, much as at present we may perceive shining through in
the writings of the learned, the native

<span id="page_lxii">p. lxii</span>

pantheism of India, which is destined sooner or later to become the
faith of the people. Ex oriente lux.'

This may seem strong language, and, in some respects, too strong. But I
thought it right to quote it here, because, whatever may be urged
against Schopenhauer, he was a thoroughly honest thinker and honest
speaker, and no one would suspect him of any predilection for what has
been so readily called Indian mysticism. That Schelling and his school
should use rapturous language about the Upanishads, might carry little
weight with that large class of philosophers by whom everything beyond
the clouds of their own horizon is labelled mysticism. But that
Schopenhauer should have spoken of the Upanishads as 'products of the
highest wisdom' (Ausgeburt der höchsten Weisheit) <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md), that he should have placed the pantheism
there taught high above the pantheism of Bruno, Malebranche, Spinoza,
and Scotus Erigena, as brought to light again at Oxford in 1681 <span
id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md), may perhaps secure a more considerate
reception for these relics of ancient wisdom than anything that I could
say in their favour.

the Persian translation: 'Hanc interpretationem τῶν Oupnekhathai

1767 A.D. Anquetil Duperron adds: 'Absolutum est hoc Apographum
