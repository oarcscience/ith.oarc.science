# FIRST ÂRA*N*YAKA.

## FIRST ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Now follows the Mahâvrata ceremony.

2\. After having killed V*ri*tra, Indra became great. When he became
great, then there was the Mahâvrata (the great work). This is why the
Mahâvrata ceremony is called Mahâvrata.

3\. Some people say: 'Let the priest make two (recitations with the
offering of the) â*g*ya (ghee) on that day,' but the right thing is
one <span id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_377).

4\. He who desires prosperity should use the hymn, pra vo devâyâgnaye
(Rv. III, 13, 1).

5\. He who desires increase should use the hymn, vi*s*o vi*s*o atithim
(Rv. VIII, 74, 1).

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

6\. The people (visa*h*) indeed are increase <span
id="fr_380"></span>[1](#fn_378), and therefore he (the sacrificer)
becomes increased.

7\. But (some say), there is the word atithim (in that hymn, which means
a guest or stranger, asking for food). Let him not therefore take that
hymn. Verily, the atithi (stranger) is able <span
id="fr_381"></span>[2](#fn_379) to go begging.

8\. 'No,' he said, 'let him take that hymn.

9\. 'For he who follows the good road and obtains distinction, he is an
atithi (guest) <span id="fr_382"></span>[3](#fn_380).

10\. 'They do not consider him who is not so, worthy to be (called) an
atithi (guest).

11\. 'Therefore let him by all means take that hymn.'

12\. If he takes that hymn, let him place the (second) tristich, âganma
v*ri*trahantamam, 'we came near to the victorious,' first.

13\. For people worship the whole year (performing the Gavâmayana
sacrifice) wishing for this day (the last but one)--they do come near.

14\. The (next following) three tristichs begin with an
Anush*t*ubh <span id="fr_383"></span>[4](#fn_381). Now Brahman is
Gâyatrî, speech is Anush*t*ubh. He thus joins speech with Brahman.

15\. He who desires glory should use the hymn, abodhy agni*h* samidhâ
ganânâm (Rv. V, 1, 1).

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

16\. He who desires offspring and cattle should use the hymn,
hotâ*g*anish<u>t</u>a *k*etana*h* (Rv. II, 5, 1).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_377"></span>[157:1](sbe01180.htm#fr_379) That it should be
one only is proved from the types, i. e. from other sacrifices, that
have to be followed in the performance of the Mahâvrata. The first type
is the Agnish*t*oma, where one *s*astra is enjoined as â*g*ya*s*astra,
viz. pra vo devâyâgnaye. In the Vi*s*va*g*it, which has to follow the
Agnish*t*oma, another hymn is put in its place, viz. agni*m* naro
dîdhitibhi*h*. In the Mahâvrata, which has to follow the Vi*s*va*g*it,
some people recommend the use of both these hymns. But that is wrong,
for there must be in the sacrifices which follow the Agnish*t*oma twelve
*s*astras altogether; and if there were two here, instead of one, we
should get a total of thirteen.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[158:1](sbe01180.htm#fr_380) The word visa*h*,
which occurs in the hymn, means people. The commentator says that
because the Vai*s*yas or tradespeople increase their capital, therefore
they are called increase.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[158:2](sbe01180.htm#fr_381) Able, or liable;
cf. Ait. Âr. II, 3, 5, 7.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[158:3](sbe01180.htm#fr_382) Atithi is here
explained by yo bhavati, and bhavati is explained as walking on the good
road. One expects yo vâ atati. The obtaining of distinction is probably
derived from ati, above, in atithi.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[158:4](sbe01180.htm#fr_383) In the first and
second the Anush*t*ubh is followed by two Gâyatrîs.
