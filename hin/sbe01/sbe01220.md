Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### SEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. This (nishkevalya-*s*astra) becomes perfect as a thousand of
B*ri*hatîs. It is glory (the glorious Brahman, not the absolute
Brahman), it is Indra. Indra is the lord of all beings. He who thus
knows Indra as the lord of all beings, departs from this world by
loosening the bonds of life <span id="fr_575"></span>[1](#fn_573.md)--so
said Mahidâsa Aitareya. Having departed he becomes Indra (or
Hira*n*yagarbha) and shines in those worlds <span
id="fr_576"></span>[2](#fn_574.md).

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

2\. And with regard to this they say: 'If a man obtains the other world
in this form (by meditating on the prâ*n*a, breath, which is the uktha,
the hymn of the mahâvrata), then in what form does he obtain this
world <span id="fr_577"></span>[1](sbe01221.htm#fn_575.md)?'

3\. Here the blood of the woman is a form of Agni (fire); therefore no
one should despise it. And the seed of the man is a form of Âditya
(sun); therefore no one should despise it. This self (the woman) gives
her self (skin, blood, and flesh) to that self (fat, bone, and marrow),
and that self (man) gives his self (fat, bone, and marrow) to this self
(skin, blood, and flesh). Thus <span
id="fr_578"></span>[2](sbe01221.htm#fn_576.md) these two grow together. In
this form (belonging to the woman and to fire) he goes to that world
(belonging to the man and the sun), and in that form (belonging to man
and the sun) he goes to this world (belonging to the woman and to
fire <span id="fr_579"></span>[3](sbe01221.htm#fn_577).md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_573"></span>[231:1](sbe01220.htm#fr_575.md) The commentator
explains visrasâ by 'merging his manhood in the identity with all,' and
doing this while still alive. Visras is the gradual loosening of the
body, the decay of old age, but here it has the meaning of vairâgya
rather, the shaking off of all that ties the Self to this body or this
life.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[231:2](sbe01220.htm#fr_576.md) The fourteen
worlds in the egg of Brahman. Comm. Some hold that he who enters on this
path, and becomes deity, does not <span id="page_232">p. 232</span>
arrive at final liberation. Others, however, show that this
identification with the uktha, and through it with the prâ*n*a (breath)
and Hira*n*yagarbha, is provisional only, and intended to prepare the
mind of the worshipper for the reception of the highest knowledge of
Brahman.
