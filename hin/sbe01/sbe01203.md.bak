### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. People say: 'Uktha, uktha,' hymns, hymns! (without knowing what
uktha, hymn <span id="fr_507"></span>[3](#fn_505), means..md) The

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

hymn is truly (to be considered as) the earth, for from it all
whatsoever exists arises.

2\. The object of its praise is Agni (fire), and the eighty verses (of
the hymn) are food, for by means of food one obtains everything.

3\. The hymn is truly the sky, for the birds fly along the sky, and men
drive following the sky. The object of its praise is Vâyu (air), and the
eighty verses (of the hymn) are food, for by means of food one obtains
everything.

4\. The hymn is truly the heaven, for from its gift (rain) all
whatsoever exists arises. The object of its praise is Âditya (the sun),
and the eighty verses are food, for by means of food one obtains
everything.

5\. So much with reference to the gods (mythological); now with
reference to man (physiological).

6\. The hymn is truly man. He is great, he is Pra*g*âpati. Let him
think, I am the hymn.

7\. The hymn is his mouth, as before in the case of the earth.

8\. The object of its praise is speech, and the eighty verses (of the
hymn) are food, for by means of food he obtains everything.

9\. The hymn is the nostrils, as before in the case of the sky.

10\. The object of its praise is breath, and the eighty verses (of the
hymn) are food, for by means of food he obtains everything.

11\. The slight bent (at the root) of the nose is, as it were, the place
of the brilliant (Âditya, the sun).

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

12\. The hymn is the forehead, as before in the case of heaven. The
object of its praise is the eye, and the eighty verses (of the hymn) are
food, for by means of food he obtains everything.

13\. The eighty verses (of the hymn) are alike food with reference to
the gods as well as with reference to man. For all these beings breathe
and live by means of food indeed. By food (given in alms, &c.) he
conquers this world, by food (given in sacrifice) he conquers the other.
Therefore the eighty verses (of the hymn) are alike food, with reference
to the gods as well as with reference to man.

14\. All this that is food, and all this that consumes food, is only the
earth, for from the earth arises all whatever there is.

115\. And all that goes hence (dies on earth), heaven consumes it all;
and all that goes thence (returns from heaven to a new life) the earth
consumes it all.

16\. That earth is thus both food and consumer.

He also (the true worshipper who meditates on himself as being the
uktha) is both consumer and consumed (subject and object <span
id="fr_508"></span>[1](#fn_506).md). No one possesses that which he does
not eat, or the things which do not eat him <span
id="fr_509"></span>[2](#fn_507.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_505"></span>[202:3](sbe01203.htm#fr_507.md) The Comm. explains
uktha as that from whence the favour of the gods arises, uttish*th*aty
anena devatâprasâda iti vyutpatte*h*. <span id="page_203">p. 203</span>
The object is now to show that the uktha or hymn used at the Mahâvrata
ceremony has a deeper meaning than it seems to have, and that its
highest aim is Brahman; not, however, the highest Brahman, but Brahman
considered as life (prâ*n*a).

<span id="fn_506"></span>[204:1](sbe01203.htm#fr_508.md) As a master who
lives by his servants, while his servants live by him. Comm.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[204:2](sbe01203.htm#fr_509.md) I have translated
these paragraphs, as much as possible, according to the commentator. I
doubt whether, either in the original or in the interpretation of the
commentator, they yield any very definite sense. They are vague
speculations, vague, at least, to us, though intended by the Brahmans to
give a deeper meaning to certain ceremonial observances connected with
the Mahâvrata. The uktha, or hymn, which is to be meditated on, as
connected with the sacrifice, is part of the Mahâvrata, an important
ceremony, to be <span id="page_205">p. 205</span> performed on the last
day but one (the twenty-fourth) of the Gavâmayana sacrifice. That
sacrifice lasts a whole year, and its performance has been fully
described in the Brâhma*n*as and Âra*n*yakas. But while the ordinary
performer of the Mahâvrata has simply to recite the uktha or
nishkevalya-*s*astra, consisting of eighty verses (t*rik*a) in the
Gâyatrî, B*ri*hatî, and Ush*n*ih metres, the more advanced worshipper
(or priest) is to know that this uktha has a deeper meaning, and is to
meditate on it as being the earth, sky, heaven, also as the human body,
mouth, nostrils, and forehead. The worshipper is in fact to identify
himself by meditation with the uktha in all its senses, and thus to
become the universal spirit or Hira*n*yagarbha. By this process he
becomes the consumer and consumed, the subject and object, of
everything, while another sacrificer, not knowing this, remains in his
limited individual sphere, or, as the text expresses it, does not
possess what he cannot eat (perceive), or what cannot eat him (perceive
him). The last sentence is explained differently by the commentator, but
in connexion with the whole passage it seems to me to become more
intelligible, if interpreted as I have proposed to interpret it.
