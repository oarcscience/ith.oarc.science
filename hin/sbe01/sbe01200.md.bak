### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. When he recites the Nishkevalya hymn addressed to Indra (Rv. X, 50),
pra vo mahe, he inserts a Nivid <span id="fr_483"></span>[2](#fn_481.md)
(between the fourth and fifth verses). Thus he clearly places strength
in himself (in the *s*astra, in the bird, in himself).

2\. They are Trish*t*ubhs and *G*agatîs.

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

3\. There they say: 'Why does he insert a Nivid among mixed Trish*t*ubhs
and *G*agatîs <span id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_482.md)?' But surely one
metre would never support the Nivid of this day, nor fill it: therefore
he inserts the Nivid among mixed Trish*t*ubhs and *G*agatîs.

4\. Let him know that this day has three Nivids: the Vasa hymn is a
Nivid, the Vâlakhilyas <span id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_483.md) are a
Nivid, and the Nivid itself is a Nivid. Thus let him know that day as
having three Nivids.

5\. Then follow the hymns vane na vâ (Rv. X, 29) and yo *g*âta eva (Rv.
II, 12). In the fourth verse of the former hymn occur the words anne
samasya yad asan manîshâ*h*, and they serve for the winning of proper
food.

6\. Then comes an insertion. As many Trish*t*ubh and *G*agatî
verses <span id="fr_486"></span>[3](#fn_484.md), taken from the ten
Ma*nd*alas and addressed to Indra, as they insert (between the two
above-mentioned hymns), after changing them into B*ri*hatîs, so many
years do they live beyond the (usual) age (of one hundred years). By
this insertion age is obtained.

7\. After that he recites the Sa*g*anîya hymn, wishing that cattle may
always come to his offspring.

8\. Then he recites the Târkshya hymn <span
id="fr_487"></span>[4](#fn_485.md). Târkshya is verily welfare, and the
hymn leads to welfare. Thus (by reciting the hymn) he fares well <span
id="fr_488"></span>[5](#fn_486.md).

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

9\. Then he recites the Ekapadâ (indro vi*s*va*m* vi râ*g*ati), wishing,
May I be everything at once, and may I thus finish the whole work of
metres <span id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_487.md).

10\. In reciting the hymn indra*m* vi*s*vâ aviv*ri*dhan (Rv. I, 11) he
intertwines the first seven verses by intertwining their feet <span
id="fr_490"></span>[2](#fn_488). There are seven prâ*n*as (openings.md) in
the head, and he thus places seven prâ*n*as in the head. The eighth
verse (half-verse) he does not intertwine <span
id="fr_491"></span>[3](#fn_489.md). The eighth is speech, and he thinks,
May my speech never be intertwined with the other prâ*n*as. Speech
therefore, though dwelling in the same abode as the other prâ*n*as, is
not intertwined with them.

11\. He recites the Virâ*g* verses <span
id="fr_492"></span>[4](#fn_490.md). Verily, Virâ*g* verses are food, and
they thus serve for the gaining of food.

12\. He ends with the hymn of Vasish*th*a <span
id="fr_493"></span>[5](#fn_491.md), wishing, May I be Vasish*th*a!

13\. But let him end with the fifth verse, esha stomo maha ugrâya vâhe,
which, possessing the word mahat, is auspicious.

14\. In the second foot of the fifth verse the word dhuri occurs.
Verily, dhu*h* (the place where the horse is fastened to the car) is the
end (of the car). This day also is the end (of the sacrifice which lasts
a whole year) <span id="fr_494"></span>[6](#fn_492.md). Thus the verse is
fit for the day.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

15\. In the third foot the word arka is auspicious.

16\. The last foot is: 'Make our glory high as heaven over heaven.' Thus
wherever Brahmanic speech is uttered, there his glory will be, when he
who knows this finishes with that verse. Therefore let a man who knows
this, finish (the Nishkevalya) with that verse.
