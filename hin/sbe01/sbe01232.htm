<p>1. T&acirc;rukshya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_650"></A><A HREF="#fn_648"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> said: 'The Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union) is formed by means of the B<I>ri</I>hat and Rathantara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_651"></A><A HREF="#fn_649"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> S&acirc;mans.'</p>  
<p>2. Verily, the Rathantara S&acirc;man is speech, the B<I>ri</I>hat S&acirc;man is breath. By both, by speech and breath, the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; is formed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_652"></A><A HREF="#fn_650"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>3. For this Upanishad (for acquiring from his teacher the knowledge of this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; of speech and breath) T&acirc;rukshya guards (his teacher's) cows a whole year.</p>  
<p>4. For it alone T&acirc;rukshya guards the cows a whole year.</p>

<p>5. This has also been declared by a <I>Ri</I>shi (Rv. X, 181, 1; and Rv. X, 181, 2):--</p>  
<p>6. 'Vasish<I>th</I>a carried hither the Rathantara; 'Bharadv&acirc;ga brought hither the B<I>ri</I>hat of Agni.'</p>  
<p>7. He who thus knows this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.</p>  
<p>8. Kau<I>n</I><I>th</I>aravya said: 'Speech is united with breath, breath with the blowing air, the blowing air with the Vi<I>s</I>vedevas, the Vi<I>s</I>vedevas with the heavenly world, the heavenly world with Brahman. That Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; is called the gradual Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;.'</p>  
<p>9. He who knows this gradual Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga, in exactly the same manner as this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, i.e. gradually.</p>  
<p>10. If that worshipper, whether for his own sake or for that of another, recites (the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;), let him know when he is going to recite, that this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; went up to heaven, and that it will be even so with those who by knowing it become Devas. May it always be so!</p>  
<p>11. He who thus knows this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.</p>  
<p>12. Pa&ntilde;<I>k</I>&acirc;la<I>k</I>a<I>n</I><I>d</I>a said: 'The Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union, composition) is speech.'</p>  
<p>13. Verily, by speech the Vedas, by speech the metres are composed. Friends unite through speech, all beings unite through speech; therefore speech is everything here&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_653"></A><A HREF="#fn_651"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>14. With regard to this (view of speech being more than breath), it should be borne in mind that when we thus repeat (the Veda) or speak, breath is (absorbed) in speech; speech swallows breath. And when we are silent or sleep, speech is (absorbed) in breath; breath swallows speech. The two swallow each other. Verily, speech is the mother, breath the son.</p>  
<p>15. This has been declared also by a <I>Ri</I>shi (Rv. X, 114, 4):--</p>  
<p>16. 'There is one bird; (as wind) he has entered the sky; (as breath or living soul) he saw this whole world. With my ripe mind I saw him close to me (in the heart); the mother (licks or) absorbs him (breath), and he absorbs the mother (speech).'</p>  
<p>17. He who thus knows this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.</p>  
<p>18. Next follows the Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati-Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;.</p>  
<p>19. The former half is the wife, the latter half the man; the result of their union the son; the act of their union the begetting; that Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; is Aditi (indestructible).</p>  
<p>20. For Aditi (indestructible) is all this whatever there is, father, mother, son, and begetting.</p>  
<p>21. This has also been declared by a <I>Ri</I>shi (Rv. I, 189, 10)--</p>  
<p>22. 'Aditi is mother, is father, is son.'</p>  
<p>23. He who thus knows this Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (union), becomes united with offspring, cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.</p>
