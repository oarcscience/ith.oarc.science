### TENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_288.md)

1\. 'These rivers, my son, run, the eastern (like the Gangâ) toward the
east, the western (like the Sindhu) toward the west. They go from sea to
sea (i. e. the clouds lift up the water from the sea to the sky, and
send it back as rain to the sea). They become indeed sea. And as those
rivers, when they are in the sea, do not know, I am this or that river,

2\. 'In the same manner, my son, all these creatures, when they have
come back from the True, know not that they have come back from the
True. Whatever these creatures are here, whether a lion, or a wolf, or a
boar, or a worm, or a midge, or a gnat, or a musquito, that they become
again and again.

3\. 'That which is that subtile essence, in it all that exists has its
self. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O *S*vetaketu, art it.'

'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.

'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_288"></span>[102:1](sbe01128.htm#fr_290.md) The next question
which the son is supposed to have asked is: If a man who has slept in
his own house, rises and goes to another village, he. knows that he has
come from his own house. Why then do people not know that they have come
from the Sat?
