*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### NINTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'As the bees <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_287), my son, make
honey by collecting the juices of distant trees, and reduce the juice
into one form,

2\. 'And as these juices have no discrimination, so that they might say,
I am the juice of this tree or that, in the same manner, my son, all
these creatures, when they have become merged in the True (either in
deep sleep or in death), know not that they are merged in the True.

3\. 'Whatever these creatures are here, whether a lion, or a wolf, or a
boar, or a worm, or a midge, or a gnat, or a musquito, that they become
again and again.

4\. 'Now that which is that subtile essence, in it all that exists has
its self. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O *S*vetaketu, art
it.'

'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.

'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_287"></span>[101:1](sbe01127.htm#fr_289) At the beginning
of each chapter the commentator supplies the question which the son is
supposed to have asked his father. The first is: All creatures falling
every day into deep sleep (sushupti) obtain thereby the Sat, the true
being. How is it then that they do not know that they obtain the Sat
every day?
