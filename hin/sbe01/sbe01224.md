Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THIRD KHA*ND*A.

1\. He thought: 'There are these worlds and the guardians of the worlds.
Let me send forth food for them.' (1)

He brooded over the water <span id="fr_599"></span>[1](#fn_597.md). From
the water thus brooded on, matter <span id="fr_600"></span>[2](#fn_598.md)
(mûrti) was born. And that matter which was born, that verily was
food <span id="fr_601"></span>[3](#fn_599). (2.md)

2\. When this food (the object matter) had thus been sent forth, it
wished to flee <span id="fr_602"></span>[4](#fn_600.md), crying and turning
away. He (the subject) tried to grasp it by speech. He could not grasp
it by speech. If he had grasped it by speech, man would be satisfied by
naming food. (3)

He tried to grasp it by scent (breath). He could not grasp it by scent.
If he had grasped it by scent, man would be satisfied by smelling food.
(4)

He tried to grasp it by the eye. He could not

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

grasp it by the eye. If he had grasped it by the eye, man would be
satisfied by seeing food. (5)

He tried to grasp it by the ear. He could not grasp it by the ear. If he
had grasped it by the ear, man would be satisfied by hearing food. (6)

He tried to grasp it by the skin. He could not grasp it by the skin. If
he had grasped it by the skin, man would be satisfied by touching food.
(7)

He tried to grasp it by the mind. He could not grasp it by the mind. If
he had grasped it by the mind, man would be satisfied by thinking food.
(8)

He tried to grasp it by the generative organ. He could not grasp it by
the organ. If he had grasped it by the organ, man would be satisfied by
sending forth food. (9)

He tried to grasp it by the down-breathing (the breath which helps to
swallow food through the mouth and to carry it off through the rectum,
the pâyvindriya). He got it.

3\. Thus it is Vâyu (the getter <span id="fr_603"></span>[1](#fn_601).md)
who lays hold of food, and the Vâyu is verily Annâyu (he who gives life
or who lives by food). (10)

4\. He thought: 'How can all this be without me?'

5\. And then he thought: 'By what way shall I get there <span
id="fr_604"></span>[2](#fn_602.md)?'

6\. And then he thought: 'If speech names, if scent smells, if the eye
sees, if the ear hears, if the skin feels, if the mind thinks, if the
off-breathing digests, if the organ sends forth, then what am I?' (11)

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

7\. Then opening the suture of the skull, he got in by that door.

8\. That door is called the Vid*ri*ti (tearing asunder), the Nândana
(the place of bliss).

9\. There are three dwelling-places for him, three dreams; this
dwelling-place (the eye), this dwelling-place (the throat), this
dwelling-place (the heart) <span id="fr_605"></span>[1](#fn_603). (12.md)

10\. When born (when the Highest Self had entered the body) he looked
through all things, in order to see whether anything wished to proclaim
here another (Self). He saw this person only (himself) as the widely
spread Brahman. 'I saw it,' thus he said <span
id="fr_606"></span>[2](#fn_604); (13.md)

Therefore he was Ida*m*-dra (seeing this).

11\. Being Ida*m*dra by name, they call him Indra mysteriously. For the
Devas love mystery, yea, they love mystery. (14)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_597"></span>[240:1](sbe01224.htm#fr_599.md) The water, as
mentioned before, or the five elements.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[240:2](sbe01224.htm#fr_600.md) Mûrti, for mûrtti,
form, Colebrooke; a being of organised form, Röer; vrîhiyavâdirûpâ
mûshakâdirûpâ *k*a mûrti*h*, i.e. vegetable food for men, animal food
for cats, &c.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[240:3](sbe01224.htm#fr_601.md) Offered food, i.e.
objects for the Devatâs and the senses in the body.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[240:4](sbe01224.htm#fr_602.md) Atya*g*ighâ*m*sat,
ati*s*ayena hantu*m* gantum ai*kkh*at. Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[241:1](sbe01224.htm#fr_603.md) An attempt to
derive vâyu from vî, to get.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[241:2](sbe01224.htm#fr_604.md) Or, by which of
the two ways shall I get in, the one way being from the top of the foot
(cf. Ait. Âr. II, 1, 4, 1), the other from the skull? Comm.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[242:1](sbe01224.htm#fr_605.md) Passages like this
must always have required an oral interpretation, but it is by no means
certain that the explanation given in the commentaries represents really
the old traditional interpretation. Sâya*n*a explains the three
dwelling-places as the right eye, in a state of waking; as the throat,
in a state of dreaming; as the heart, in a state of profound sleep.
*S*aṅkara explains them as the right eye, the inner mind, and the ether
in the heart. Sâya*n*a allows another interpretation of the three
dwelling-places being the body of the father, the body of the mother,
and one's own body. The three dreams or sleeps he explains by waking,
dreaming, and profound sleep, and he remarks that waking too is called a
dream as compared with the true awakening, which is the knowledge of
Brahman. In the last sentence the speaker, when repeating three times
'this dwelling-place,' is supposed to point to his right eye, the
throat, and the heart. This interpretation is supported by a passage in
the Brahma-upanishad, Netre *g*âgarita*m* vidyât ka*nth*e svapna*m*
samâdi*s*et, sushupta*m* h*ri*dayasya tu.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[242:2](sbe01224.htm#fr_606.md) In this passage,
which is very obscure, *S*aṅkara fails us, either because, as
Ânanda*g*ñâna says, he thought the text was too easy to require any
explanation, or because the writers of the MSS. left out <span
id="page_243">p. 243</span> the passage. Ânanda*g*ñâna explains: 'He
looked through all creatures, he identified himself with them, and
thought he was a man, blind, happy, &c.; or, as it is elsewhere
expressed, he developed forms and names. And how did this mistake arise?
Because he did not see the other, the true Self;' or literally, 'Did he
see the other Self?' which is only a figure of speech to convey the
meaning that he did not see it. The particle iti is then to be taken in
a causal sense, (i. e. he did so, because what else could he have wished
to proclaim?) But he allows another explanation, viz. 'He considered all
beings, whether they existed by themselves or not, and after having
considered, he arrived at the conclusion, What shall I call different
from the true Self?' The real difficulties, however, are not removed by
these explanations. First of all, we expect vâvadisham before iti, and
secondly, unless anyam refers to âtmânam, we expect anyad. My own
translation is literal, but I am not certain that it conveys the true
meaning. One might understand it as implying that the Self looked about
through all things, in order to find out, 'What does wish to proclaim
here another Self?' And when he saw there was nothing which did not come
from himself, then he recognised that the Purusha, the person he had
sent forth, or, as we should say, the person he had created, was the
developed Brahman, was the Âtman, was himself. Sâya*n*a explains
vâvadishat by vadishyâmi, but before iti the third person cannot well
refer to the subject of vyaikshat.
