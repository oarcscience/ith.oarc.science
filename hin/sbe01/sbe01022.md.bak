# *KH*ÂNDOGYA-UPANISHAD.

## FIRST PRAPÂ*TH*AKA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md).

1\. LET a man meditate on the syllable <span
id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70.md) Om, called the udgîtha; for the udgîtha (a
portion of the Sâma-veda) is sung, beginning with Om.

The full account, however, of Om is this:--

2\. The essence <span id="fr_71"></span>[3](#fn_71.md) of all beings is the
earth, the essence of the earth is water, the essence of water

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

the plants, the essence of plants man, the essence of man speech, the
essence of speech the Rig-veda, the essence of the Rig-veda the
Sâma-veda <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md), the essence of the
Sâma-veda the udgîtha (which is Om).

3\. That udgîtha (Om) is the best of all essences, the highest,
deserving the highest place <span id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_73.md), the
eighth.

4\. What then is the *Rik*? What is the Sâman? What is the udgîtha?
'This is the question.

5\. The *Rik* indeed is speech, Sâman is breath, the udgîtha is the
syllable Om. Now speech and breath, or *Rik* and Sâman, form one couple.

6\. And that couple is joined together in the syllable Om. When two
people come together, they fulfil each other's desire.

7\. Thus he who knowing this, meditates on the syllable (Om), the
udgîtha, becomes indeed a fulfiller of desires.

8\. That syllable is a syllable of permission, for whenever we permit
anything, we say Om, yes. Now permission is gratification. He who
knowing this meditates on the syllable (Om), the udgîtha, becomes indeed
a gratifier of desires.

9\. By that syllable does the threefold knowledge (the sacrifice, more
particularly the Soma-sacrifice, as founded on the three Vedas) proceed.
When the Adhvaryu priest gives an order, he says Om. When the Hot*ri*
priest recites, he says Om. When the Udgât*ri* priest sings, he says Om,

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --all for the
glory of that syllable. The threefold knowledge (the sacrifice) proceeds
by the greatness of that syllable (the vital breaths), and by its
essence (the oblations) <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md).

10\. Now therefore it would seem to follow, that both he who knows this
(the true meaning of the syllable Om), and he who does not, perform the
same sacrifice <span id="fr_75"></span>[2](#fn_75.md). But this is not so,
for knowledge and ignorance are different. The sacrifice which a man
performs with knowledge, faith, and the Upanishad <span
id="fr_76"></span>[3](#fn_76.md) is more powerful. This is the full account
of the syllable Om.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_69"></span>[1:1](sbe01022.htm#fr_69.md) The
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad begins with recommending meditation on the
syllable Om, a sacred syllable that had to be pronounced at the
beginning of each Veda and of every recitation of Vedic hymns. As
connected with the Sâma-veda, that syllable Om is called udgîtha. Its
more usual name is pra*n*ava. The object of the Upanishad is to explain
the various meanings which the syllable Om may assume in the mind of a
devotee, some of them being extremely artificial and senseless, till at
last the highest meaning of Om is reached, viz. Brahman, the intelligent
cause of the universe.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[1:2](sbe01022.htm#fr_70.md) Akshara means both
syllable and the imperishable, i.e. Brahman.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[1:3](sbe01022.htm#fr_71.md) Essence, rasa, is
explained in different ways, as origin, support, end, cause, and effect.
Rasa means originally the sap of trees. That sap may be conceived either
as the essence extracted from the tree, or as what gives vigour and life
to a tree. In the former case it might be transferred to the conception
of effect, in the latter to that of cause. In our sentence it has
sometimes the one, sometimes the other meaning. Earth is the support of
all beings, water pervades the earth, plants arise from water, man lives
by plants, speech is the best part of man, the Rig-veda the best part of
speech, the Sâma-veda the best extract from the *Rik*, udgîtha, or the
syllable Om, the crown of the Sâma-veda.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[2:1](sbe01022.htm#fr_72.md) Because most of the
hymns of the Sâma-veda are taken from the Rig-veda.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[2:2](sbe01022.htm#fr_73.md) Parârdhya is here
derived from para, highest, and ardha, place. The eighth means the
eighth or East in the series of essences.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[3:1](sbe01022.htm#fr_74.md) These are allusions to
sacrificial technicalities, all intended to show the importance of the
syllable Om, partly as a mere word, used at the sacrifices, partly as
the mysterious name of the Highest Self. As every priest at the
Soma-sacrifices, in which three classes of priests are always engaged,
has to begin his part of the ceremonial with Om, therefore the whole
sacrifice is said to be dependent on the syllable Om, and to be for the
glory of that syllable, as an emblem of the Highest Self, a knowledge of
whom is the indirect result of all sacrifices. The greatness of the
syllable Om is explained by the vital breaths of the priest, the
sacrificer, and his wife; its essence by rice, corn, &c., which
constitute the oblations. Why breath and food are due to the syllable Om
is explained by the sacrifice, which is dependent on that syllable,
ascending to the sun, the sun sending rain, rain producing food, and
food producing breath and life.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[3:2](sbe01022.htm#fr_75.md) He who simply
pronounces the syllable Om as part of his recitation at a sacrifice, and
he who knows the hidden meaning of that syllable, both may perform the
same sacrifice. But that performed by the latter is more powerful,
because knowledge is better than ignorance. This is, as usual, explained
by some comparisons. It is true that both he who knows the quality of
the harîtakî and he who does not, are purged alike if they take it. But
on the other hand, if a jeweller and a mere clod sell a precious stone,
the knowledge of the former bears better fruit than the ignorance of the
latter.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[3:3](sbe01022.htm#fr_76.md) Upanishad is here
explained by yoga, and yoga by devatâdivishayam upâsanam, meditation
directed to certain deities, More <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> likely,
however, it refers to this very upanishad, i.e. to the udgîthavidyâ, the
doctrine of the secret meaning of Om, as here explained.
