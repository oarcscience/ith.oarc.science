*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FOURTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. All this is Brahman (n.) Let a man meditate on that (visible world)
as beginning, ending, and breathing <span
id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_179) in it (the Brahman.md).

Now man is a creature of will. According to what his will is in this
world, so will he be when he has departed this life. Let him therefore
have this will and belief:

2\. The intelligent, whose body is spirit, whose form is light, whose
thoughts are true, whose nature is like ether (omnipresent and
invisible), from whom all works, all desires, all sweet odours and
tastes proceed; he who embraces all this, who never speaks, and is never
surprised,

3\. He is my self within the heart, smaller than a corn of rice, smaller
than a corn of barley, smaller than a mustard seed, smaller than a
canary seed or the kernel of a canary seed. He also is my self within
the heart, greater than the earth, greater than the sky, greater than
heaven, greater than all these worlds.

4\. He from whom all works, all desires, all sweet odours and tastes
proceed, who embraces all this, who never speaks and who is never
surprised, he, my self within the heart, is that Brahman (n.) When I
shall have departed from hence, I shall obtain him (that Self). He who
has this faith <span id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_180.md) has no doubt; thus
said *S*â*nd*ilya <span id="fr_182"></span>[3](#fn_181.md), yea, thus he
said.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_179"></span>[48:1](sbe01072.htm#fr_180.md) *G*alân is
explained by *g*a, born, la, absorbed, and an, breathing. It is an
artificial term, but fully recognised by the Vedânta school, and always
explained in this manner.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[48:2](sbe01072.htm#fr_181.md) Or he who has faith
and no doubt, will obtain this.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[48:3](sbe01072.htm#fr_182.md) This chapter is
frequently quoted as the *S*â*nd*ilya-vidyâ, Vedântasâra, init;
Vedânta-sûtra III, 3, 31.
