## RAMMOHUN ROY.

Greater, however, than the influence exercised on the philosophical
thought of modern Europe, has been the impulse which these same
Upanishads have imparted to the religious life of modern India. In about
the same year (1774 or 1775) when the first MS. of the Persian
translation of the Upanishads was received by Anquetil Duperron,
Rammohun Roy <span id="fr_23"></span>[3](#fn_23.md) was born in India, the
reformer and reviver of the ancient religion of the Brahmans. A man who
in his youth could write a book 'Against the Idolatry of all Religions,'
and who afterwards expressed in so many exact words his 'belief in the
divine authority of Christ <span id="fr_24"></span>[4](#fn_24.md)' was not
likely to retain anything of the sacred literature of his own religion,
unless he had perceived in it the same

<span id="page_lxiii">p. lxiii</span>

divine authority which he recognised in the teaching of Christ. He
rejected the Purâ*n*as, he would not have been swayed in his convictions
by the authority of the Laws of Manu, or even by the sacredness of the
Vedas. He was above all that. But he discovered in the Upanishads and in
the so-called Vedânta something different from all the rest, something
that ought not to be thrown away, something that, if rightly understood,
might supply the right native soil in which alone the seeds of true
religion, aye, of true Christianity, might spring up again and prosper
in India, as they had once sprung up and prospered from out the
philosophies of Origen or Synesius. European scholars have often
wondered that Rammohun Roy, in his defence of the Veda, should have put
aside the Sa*m*hitâs and the Brâhma*n*as, and laid his finger on the
Upanishads only, as the true kernel of the whole Veda. Historically, no
doubt, he was wrong, for the Upanishads presuppose both the hymns and
the liturgical books of the Veda. But as the ancient philosophers
distinguished in the Veda between the Karma-kâ*nd*a and the
*G*ñâna-kâ*nd*a, between works and knowledge; as they themselves pointed
to the learning of the sacred hymns and the performance of sacrifices as
a preparation only for that enlightenment which was reserved as the
highest reward for the faithful performance of all previous duties <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md), Rammohun Roy, like Buddha and other
enlightened men before him, perceived that the time for insisting on all
that previous discipline with its minute prescriptions and superstitious
observances was gone, while the knowledge conveyed in the Upanishads or
the Vedânta, enveloped though it may be in strange coverings, should
henceforth form the foundation of a new religious life <span
id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md). He would tolerate nothing idolatrous, not
even in his mother, poor woman, who after joining his most bitter
opponents, confessed to her son, before she set out on her

<span id="page_lxiv">p. lxiv</span>

last pilgrimage to Juggernaut, where she died, that 'he was right, but
that she was a weak woman, and grown too old to give up the observances
which were a comfort to her.' It was not therefore from any regard of
their antiquity or their sacred character that Rammohun Roy clung to the
Upanishads, that he translated them into Bengali, Hindi, and English,
and published them at his own expense. It was because he recognised in
them seeds of eternal truth, and was bold enough to distinguish between
what was essential in them and what was not,--a distinction, as he often
remarked with great perplexity, which Christian teachers seemed either
unable or unwilling to make <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md).

The death of that really great and good man during his stay in England
in 1833, was one of the severest blows that have fallen on the prospects
of India. But his work has not been in vain. Like a tree whose first
shoot has been killed by one winter frost, it has broken out again in a
number of new and more vigorous shoots, for whatever the outward
differences may be between the Âdi Brahmo Samâj of Debendranath Tagore,
or the Brahmo Samâj of India of Keshub Chunder Sen, or the Sadharan
Brahmo Samâj, the common root of them all is the work done, once for
all, by Rammohun Roy. That work may have disappeared from sight for a
time, and its present manifestations may seem to many observers who are
too near, not very promising. But in one form or another, under one name
or another, I feel convinced that work will live. 'In India,'
Schopenhauer writes, 'our religion will now and never strike root: the
primitive wisdom of the human race will never be pushed aside there by
the events of Galilee. On the contrary, Indian wisdom will flow back
upon Europe, and produce a thorough change in our knowing and thinking.'
Here, again, the great philosopher seems to me to have allowed himself
to be carried away too far by his enthusiasm for the less known. He is
blind for the dark sides of the Upanishads, and he wilfully shuts his
eyes against the bright rays of eternal truth in the Gospels, which even

<span id="page_lxv">p. lxv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rammohun Roy was
quick enough to perceive behind the mists and clouds of tradition that
gather so quickly round the sunrise of every religion.
