### SEVENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_344"></span>[3](#fn_342).

1\. Pra*g*âpati said: 'The Self which is free from sin, free from old
age, from death and grief, from hunger and thirst, which desires nothing
but what it ought to desire, and imagines nothing but what it ought to
imagine, that it is which we must search out, that it is which we must
try to understand. He who has searched out that Self and understands it,
obtains all worlds and all desires.'

2\. The Devas (gods) and Asuras (demons) both heard these words, and
said: 'Well, let us search for that Self by which, if one has searched
it out, all worlds and all desires are obtained.'

Thus saying Indra went from the Devas, Viro*k*ana from the Asuras, and
both, without having communicated with each other, approached
Pra*g*âpati,

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

holding fuel in their hands, as is the custom for pupils approaching
their master.

3\. They dwelt there as pupils for thirty-two years. Then Pra*g*âpati
asked them: 'For what purpose have you both dwelt here?'

They replied: 'A saying of yours is being repeated, viz. "the Self which
is free from sin, free from old age, from death and grief, from hunger
and thirst, which desires nothing but what it ought to desire, and
imagines nothing but what it ought to imagine, that it is which we must
search out, that it is which we must try to understand. He who has
searched out that Self and understands it, obtains all worlds and all
desires." Now we both have dwelt here because we wish for that Self.'

Pra*g*âpati said to them: 'The person that is seen in the eye <span
id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_343), that is the Self. This is what I have
said. This is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman.'

They asked: 'Sir, he who is perceived in the water, and he who is
perceived in a mirror, who is he?'

He replied: 'He himself indeed is seen in all these <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_340"></span>[134:1](sbe01166.htm#fr_342) Prasna Up. II, 1.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[134:2](sbe01166.htm#fr_343) The same verse
occurs in the Ka*th*a 6, 16, and is frequently quoted elsewhere, for
instance, Mait. comm. p. 164. For vishva<u>nn</u>, the right reading
would seem to be vishvak. In the Mait. Up. VI, 30, the Trish*t*ubh are
reduced to Anush*t*ubh verses. See also Prasna Up. III, 6-7; Mu*nd*. Up.
II, 2.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[134:3](sbe01167.htm#fr_344) Here the highest
problem is treated again, the knowledge of the true Self, which leads
beyond the world of Brahmâ (masc.), and enables the individual self to
return into the Highest Self.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[135:1](sbe01167.htm#fr_345) The commentator
explains this rightly. Pra*g*âpati means by the person that is seen in
the eye, the real agent of seeing, who is seen by sages only, even with
their eyes shut. His pupils, however, misunderstand him. They think of
the person that is seen, not of the person that sees (Yoga-sûtras II,
6). The person seen in the eye is to them the small figure imaged in the
eye, and they go on therefore to ask, whether the image in the water or
in a mirror is not the Self.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[135:2](sbe01167.htm#fr_346) The commentators
are at great pains to explain that Pra*g*âpati told no falsehood. He
meant by purusha the personal element in the highest sense, and it was
not his fault that his pupils took purusha for man or body.
