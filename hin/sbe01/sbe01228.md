# THIRD ÂRA*N*YAKA <span id="fr_621"></span>[1](#fn_619.md).

## FIRST ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Next follows the Upanishad of the Sa*m*hitâ <span
id="fr_622"></span>[2](#fn_620.md).

2\. The former half is the earth, the latter half the heaven, their
union the air <span id="fr_623"></span>[3](#fn_621.md), thus says
Mâ*nd*ukeya; their union is the ether, thus did Mâkshavya teach it.

3\. That air is not considered <span id="fr_624"></span>[4](#fn_622.md)
independent <span id="fr_625"></span>[5](#fn_623.md), therefore I do not
agree with his (Mandûka's) son.

4\. Verily, the two are the same, therefore air is

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

considered independent, thus says Âgastya. For it is the same, whether
they say air or ether <span id="fr_626"></span>[1](sbe01229.htm#fn_624.md).

5\. So far with reference to deities (mythologically); now with
reference to the body (physiologically):

6\. The former half is speech, the latter half is mind, their union
breath (prâ*n*a), thus says *S*ûravîra <span
id="fr_627"></span>[2](sbe01229.htm#fn_625.md) Mâ*nd*ukeya.

7\. But his eldest son said: The former half is mind, the latter half
speech. For we first conceive with the mind indeed <span
id="fr_628"></span>[3](sbe01229.htm#fn_626.md), and then we utter with
speech. Therefore the former half is indeed mind, the latter half
speech, but their union is really breath.

8\. Verily, it is the same with both, the father (Mâ*nd*ukeya) and the
son <span id="fr_629"></span>[4](sbe01229.htm#fn_627.md).

9\. This (meditation as here described), joined <span
id="fr_630"></span>[5](sbe01229.htm#fn_628.md) with mind, speech, and
breath, is (like) a chariot drawn by two horses and one horse between
them (prash*t*ivâhana).

10\. And he who thus knows this union, becomes united with offspring,
cattle, fame, glory of countenance, and the world of Svarga. He lives
his full age.

11\. Now all this comes from the Mâ*nd*ukeyas.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_619"></span>[247:1](sbe01228.htm#fr_621.md) This last portion
of the Upanishad is found in the MS. discovered by Dr. Bühler in
Kashmir, and described by him in the journal of the Bombay Branch of the
Royal Asiatic Society, 1877, p. 36. I have collated it, so far as it was
possible to read it, many lines being either broken off altogether, or
almost entirely obliterated.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[247:2](sbe01228.htm#fr_622.md) Sa*m*hitâ is the
sacred text in which all letters are closely joined. The joining
together of two letters is called their sa*m*hitâ; the first letter of a
joined group the pûrvarûpa (n.), the second the uttararûpa. For
instance, in agnim î*l*e the m is pûrvarûpa, the î uttararûpa, and mî
their sa*m*hitâ or union.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[247:3](sbe01228.htm#fr_623.md) As in worshipping
the *S*âlagrâma stone, we really worship Vishnu, so we ought to perceive
the earth, the heaven, and the air when we pronounce the first and the
second letters of a group, and that group itself.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[247:4](sbe01228.htm#fr_624.md) Mene has here been
taken as 3rd pers. sing. perf. passive. The commentator, however,
explains it as an active verb, ni*sk*itavân.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[247:5](sbe01228.htm#fr_625.md) Because it is
included in the ether, not the ether in the air. Comm.
