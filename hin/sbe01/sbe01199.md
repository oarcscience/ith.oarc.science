## FIFTH ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. He recites the Va*s*a hymn <span id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_475.md),
wishing, May everything be in my power.

2\. They (its verses) are twenty-one <span
id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_476.md), for twenty-one are the parts (the
lungs, spleen, &c.) in the belly.

3\. Then the Ekavi*m*sa is verily the support of all Stomas, and the
belly the support of all food.

4\. They consist of different metres. Verily, the intestines are
confused, some small, some large.

5\. He recites them with the pra*n*ava <span
id="fr_479"></span>[3](#fn_477.md), according to the metre <span
id="fr_480"></span>[4](#fn_478.md), and according to rule <span
id="fr_481"></span>[5](#fn_479.md). Verily, the intestines are according to
rule, as it were; some shorter, some longer.

6\. Next comes the Sûdadohas verse. Sûdadohas verily is breath. He joins
the joints; with breath.

7\. After having recited that verse twelve times he

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

leaves it off there. These prâ*n*as are verily twelvefold, seven in the
head, two on the breast, three below. In these twelve places the
prâ*n*as are contained, there they are perfect. Therefore he leaves it
off there <span id="fr_482"></span>[1](sbe01200.htm#fn_480.md).

8\. The hymn indrâgnî yuva*m* su nah (Rv. VIII, 40) forms the two thighs
(of the bird) belonging to Indra and Agni, the two supports with broad
bones.

9\. These (verses) consist of six feet, so that they may stand firm. Man
stands firm on two feet, animals on four. He thus places man (the
sacrificer), standing on two feet, among four-footed cattle.

10\. The second verse has seven feet, and he makes it into a Gâyatrî and
Anush*t*ubh. Gâyatrî is Brahman, Anush*t*ubh is speech; and he thus puts
together speech with Brahman.

11\. He recites a Trish*t*ubh at the end. Trish*t*ubh is strength, and
thus does he come round animals by strength. Therefore animals come near
where there is strength (of command, &c.); they come to be roused and to
rise up, (they obey the commands of a strong shepherd.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_475"></span>[193:1](sbe01199.htm#fr_477.md) Having recited the
verses which form the body, neck, head, wings, and tail of the bird,
also the food intended for the bird, he now describes the Va*s*a hymn,
i.e. the hymn composed by Va*s*a, Rv. VIII, 46. That hymn takes the
place of the stomach which receives the food intended for the bird. Cf.
Ait. Âr. V, 2, 5. In I, 5, 2, 4 it is called a Nivid.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[193:2](sbe01199.htm#fr_478.md) Verses 1-20 of the
Vasa hymn, and one Sûdadohas.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[193:3](sbe01199.htm#fr_479.md) Pra*n*âvam means
'with pra*n*ava,' i.e. inserting Om in the proper places.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[193:4](sbe01199.htm#fr_480.md) According as the
metres of the different verses are fixed by *S*aunaka, Ait. Âr. V, 2, 5,
who says that verse 15 is Dvipadâ, and that the last four words, nûnam
atha, form an Ekapadâ.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[193:5](sbe01199.htm#fr_481.md) According to rule,
i.e. so that they should come right as Â*s*valâyana has prescribed the
recitation of Dvipadâ and Ekapadâ verses. In a Dvipadâ there should be a
stop after the first foot, and Om at the end o f the second. Ira an
Ekapadâ there should be Om at the beginning and at the end.
