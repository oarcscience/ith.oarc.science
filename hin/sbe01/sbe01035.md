## SECOND PRAPÂTHAKA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. Meditation on the whole <span id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_124) of the
Sâman is good, and people, when anything is good, say it is Sâman; when
it is not good, it is not Sâman.

2\. Thus they also say, he approached him with Sâman, i. e. becomingly;
and he approached him without Sâman, i. e. unbecomingly.

:3. And they also say, truly this is Sâman for us, i.e. it is good for
us, when it is good; and truly that is not Sâman for us, i. e. it is not
good for us, when it is not good.

4\. If any one knowing this meditates on the Sâman as good, depend upon
it all good qualities will approach quickly, aye, they will become his
own <span id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_125).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_124"></span>[23:1](sbe01035.htm#fr_125) Hitherto meditation
on certain portions only of the Sâma-veda and the Sâma-sacrifice had
been enjoined, and their deeper meaning explained. Now the same is done
for the whole of the Sâman.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[23:2](sbe01035.htm#fr_126) Cf. *Kh*. Up. III,
19, 4.
