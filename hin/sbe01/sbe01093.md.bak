### SIXTEENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_220.md).

1\. Verily, he who purifies (Vâyu) is the sacrifice, for he (the air)
moving along purifies everything.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Because moving
along he purifies everything, therefore he is the sacrifice. Of that
sacrifice there are two ways, by mind and by speech.

2\. The Brahman priest performs one of them in his mind <span
id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_221.md), the Hot*ri*, Adhvaryu, and Udgât*ri*
priests perform the other by words. When the Brahman priest, after the
Prâtaranuvâka ceremony has begun, but before the recitation of the
Paridhânîyâ hymn, has (to break his silence and) to speak,

3\. He performs perfectly the one way only (that by words), but the
other is injured. As a man walking on one foot, or a carriage going on
one wheel, is injured, his sacrifice is injured, and with the injured
sacrifice the sacrificer is injured; yes, having sacrificed, he becomes
worse.

4\. But when after the Prâtaranuvâka ceremony has begun, and before the
recitation of the Paridhânîyâ hymn, the Brahman priest has not (to break
his silence and) to speak, they perform both ways perfectly, and neither
of them is injured.

5\. As a man walking on two legs and a carriage going on two wheels gets
on, so his sacrifice gets on, and with the successful sacrifice the
sacrificer gets on; yes, having sacrificed, he becomes better.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_220"></span>[68:3](sbe01093.htm#fr_221.md) If any mistakes
happen during the performance of a sacrifice, as described before, they
are remedied by certain interjectional <span id="page_69">p. 69</span>
syllables (vyâh*ri*ti), the nature of which is next described. All this
is supposed to take place in the forest.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[69:1](sbe01093.htm#fr_222.md) While the other
priests perform the sacrifice, the Brahman priest has to remain silent,
following the whole sacrifice in his mind, and watching that no mistake
be committed. If a mistake is committed, he has to correct it, and for
that purpose certain corrective penances (prâya*sk*itta) are enjoined.
The performance of the Brahman priest resembles the meditations of the
sages in the forest, and therefore this chapter is here inserted.
