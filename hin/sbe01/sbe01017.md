### I.

## THE *KH*ÂNDOGYA-UPANISHAD.

THE *Kh*ândogya-upanishad belongs to the Sâma-veda. Together with the
B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka, which belongs to the Ya*g*ur-veda, it has
contributed the most important materials to what may be called the
orthodox philosophy of India, the Vedânta <span
id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md), i.e. the end, the purpose, the highest
object of the Veda. It consists of eight adhyâyas or lectures, and
formed part of a *Kh*ândogya-brâhma*n*a, in which it was preceded by two
other adhyâyas. While MSS. of the *Kh*ândogya-upanishad and its
commentary are frequent, no MSS. of the whole Brâhma*n*a has been met
with in Europe. Several scholars had actually doubted its existence, but
Rajendralal Mitra <span id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md), in the
Introduction to his translation of the *Kh*ândogya-upanishad, states
that in India 'MSS. of the work are easily available, though as yet he
has seen no commentary attached to the Brâhma*n*a portion of any one of
them.' 'According to general acceptation,'

<span id="page_lxxxvii">p. lxxxvii</span>

he adds, 'the work embraces ten chapters, of which the first two are
reckoned to be the Brâhma*n*a, and the rest is known under the name of
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad. In their arrangement and style the two portions
differ greatly, and judged by them they appear to be productions of very
different ages, though both are evidently relics of pretty remote
antiquity. Of the two chapters of the *Kh*ândogya-brâhma*n*a <span
id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48), the first includes eight sûktas (hymns.md)
on the ceremony of marriage, and the rites necessary to be observed at
the birth of a child. The first sûktas is intended to be recited when
offering an oblation to Agni on the occasion of a marriage, and its
object is to pray for prosperity in behalf of the married couple. The
second prays for long life, kind relatives, and a numerous progeny. The
third is the marriage pledge by which the contracting parties bind
themselves to each other. Its spirit may be guessed from a single verse.
In talking of the unanimity with which they will dwell, the bridegroom
addresses his bride, "That heart of thine shall be mine, and this heart
of mine shall be thine <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49.md)." The fourth
and the fifth invoke Agni, Vâyu, *K*andramas, and Sûrya to bless the
couple and ensure healthful progeny. The sixth is a mantra for offering
an oblation on the birth of a child; and the seventh and the eighth are
prayers for its being healthy, wealthy, and powerful, not weak, poor, or
mute, and to ensure a profusion of wealth and milch-cows. The first
sûkta of the second chapter is addressed to the Earth, Agni, and Indra,
with a prayer for wealth, health, and prosperity; the second, third,
fourth, fifth, and sixth are mantras for offering oblations to cattle,
the manes, Sûrya, and divers minor deities. The seventh is a curse upon
worms, insects, flies, and other nuisances, and the last, the concluding
mantra of the marriage ceremony, in which a general blessing is invoked
for all concerned.'

After this statement there can be but little doubt that

<span id="page_lxxxviii">p. lxxxviii</span>

this Upanishad originally formed part of a Brâhma*n*a. This may have
been called either by a general name, the Brâhma*n*a of the *Kh*andogas,
the followers of the Sâma-veda, or, on account of the prominent place
occupied in it by the Upanishad, the Upanishad-brâhma*n*a <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md). In that case it would be one of the eight
Brâhma*n*as of the Sâma-veda, enumerated by Kumârila Bha*tt*a and
others <span id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md), and called simply Upanishad,
scil. Brâhma*n*a.

The text of the Upanishad with the commentary of *S*aṅkara and the gloss
of Ânandagiri has been published in the Bibliotheca Indica. The edition
can only claim the character of a manuscript, and of a manuscript not
always very correctly read.

A translation of the Upanishad was published, likewise in the
Bibliotheca Indica, by Rajendralal Mitra.

It is one of the Upanishads that was translated into Persian under the
auspices of Dârâ Shukoh <span id="fr_52"></span>[3](#fn_52.md), and from
Persian into French by Anquetil Duperron, in his Oupnekhat, i.e.
Secretum Tegendum. Portions of it were translated into English by
Colebrooke in his Miscellaneous Essays, into Latin and German by F. W.
Windischmann, in his *S*aṅkara, seu de theologumenis Vedanticorum.
(Bonn, 1833), and in a work published by his father, K. J. H.
Windischmann, Die Philosophie im Fortgang der Weltgeschichte (Bonn,
1827-34). Professor A. Weber has treated of this Upanishad in his
Indische Studien I, 254; likewise M. P. Regnaud in his Matériaux pour
servir à l'histoire dc la philosophie de l'Inde (Paris, 1876) and Mr.
Gough in several articles on 'the Philosophy of the Upanishads,' in the
Calcutta Review, No. CXXXI.

I have consulted my predecessors whenever there was a serious difficulty
to solve in the translation of these ancient texts. These difficulties
are very numerous, as those know

<span id="page_lxxxix">p. lxxxix</span>

best who have attempted to give complete translations of these ancient
texts. It will be seen that my translation differs sometimes very
considerably from those of my predecessors. Though I have but seldom
entered into any controversy with them, they may rest assured that I
have not deviated from them without careful reflection.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_46"></span>[lxxxvi:1](sbe01017.htm#fr_46.md) Vedânta, as a
technical term, did not mean originally the last portions of the Veda,
or chapters placed, as it were, at the end of a volume of Vedic
literature, but the end, i. e. the object, the highest purpose of the
Veda. There are, of course, passages, like the one in the
Taittirîya-âra*n*yaka (ed. Rajendralal Mitra, p. 820), which have been
misunderstood both by native and European scholars, and where vedânta
means simply the end of the Veda:--yo vedâdau svara*h* prokto vedânte ka
pratish*th*ita*h*, 'the Om which is pronounced at the beginning of the
Veda, and has its place also at the end of the Veda.' Here vedânta
stands simply in opposition to vedâdau, and it is impossible to
translate it, as Sâya*n*a does, by Vedânta or Upanishad. Vedânta, in the
sense of philosophy, occurs in the Taittirîya-âra*n*yaka (p. 817), in a
verse of the Narâya*n*îya-upanishad, repeated in the Mundaka-upanishad
III, 2, 6, and elsewhere, vedântavi*g*ñânasuni*sk*itârâ*h*, 'those who
have well understood the object of the knowledge arising from the
Vedânta,' not 'from the last books of the Veda;' and Svetâsvatara-up.
VI, 22, vedânte parama*m* guhyam, 'the highest mystery in the Vedânta.'
Afterwards it is used in the plural also, e. g. Kshurikopanishad, 10
(Bibl. Ind. p. 210), pu*nd*arîketi vedânteshu nigadyate, 'it is called
pu*nd*arîka in the Vedântas,' i. e. in the *Kh*ândogya and other
Upanishads, as the commentator says, but not in the last books of each
Veda. A curious passage is found in the Gautama-sûtras XIX, 12, where a
distinction seems to be made between Upanishad and Vedânta. Sacred
Books, vol. ii, p. 272.

*Kh*ândogya-upanishad, translated by Rajendralal Mitra, Calcutta, 1862,
Introduction, p. 17.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[lxxxvii:1](sbe01017.htm#fr_48.md) It begins, Om,
deva savita*h*, pra Suva ya*g*ñam pra suva ya*g*ñapatim bhagâya. The
second begins, ya*h* prâkyâ*m* di*s*i sarparâ*g*a esha te bali*h*.

tad astu h*ri*dayam tava.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[lxxxviii:1](sbe01017.htm#fr_50.md) The same name
seems, however, to be given to the adhyâya of the Talavakâra-brâhma*n*a,
which contains the Kena-upanishad.

literature of the Sâma-veda may be found in Dr. Burnell's editions of
the smaller Brâhma*n*as of that Veda.
