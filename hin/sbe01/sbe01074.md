### SIXTEENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_185).

1\. Man is sacrifice. His (first) twenty-four years are the
morning-libation. The Gâyatrî has twenty-four syllables, the
morning-libation is offered with Gâyatrî hymns. The Vasus are connected
with that part of the sacrifice. The Prâ*n*as (the five senses) are the
Vasus, for they make all this to abide (vâsayanti).

2\. If anything ails him in that (early) age, let him say: 'Ye Prâ*n*as,
ye Vasus, extend this my morning-libation unto the midday-libation, that
I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Prâ*n*as or
Vasus.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.

3\. The next forty-four years are the midday-libation. The Trish*t*ubh
has forty-four syllables, the midday-libation is offered with
Trish*t*ubh hymns. The Rudras are connected with that part of it. The
Prâ*n*as are the Rudras, for they make all this to cry (rodayanti).

4\. If anything ails him in that (second) age, let him say: 'Ye
Prâ*n*as, ye Rudras, extend this my midday-libation unto the third
libation, that I, the sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the
Prâ*n*as or Rudras.' Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes
whole.

5\. The next forty-eight years are the third

libation. The *G*agatî has forty-eight syllables, the third libation is
offered with *G*agatî hymns. The Âdityas are connected with that part of
it. The Prâ*n*as are the Âdityas, for they take up all this (âdadate).

6\. If anything ails him in that (third) age, let him say: 'Ye Prâ*n*as,
ye Âdityas, extend this my third libation unto the full age, that I, the
sacrificer, may not perish in the midst of the Prâ*n*as or Âdityas.'
Thus he recovers from his illness, and becomes whole.

7\. Mahidâsa Aitareya (the son of Itarâ), who knew this, said
(addressing a disease): 'Why dost thou afflict me, as I shall not die by
it?' He lived a hundred and sixteen years (i.e. 24+44+48). He, too, who
knows this lives on to a hundred and sixteen years.
