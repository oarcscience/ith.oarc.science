### ELEVENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_291"></span>[2](#fn_289).

1\. 'If some one were to strike at the root of this large tree here, it
would bleed, but live. If he were to strike at its stem, it would bleed,
but live. If he were to strike at its top, it would bleed, but live.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pervaded by the
living Self that tree stands firm, drinking in its nourishment and
rejoicing;

2\. 'But if the life (the living Self) leaves one of its branches, that
branch withers; if it leaves a second, that branch withers; if it leaves
a third, that branch withers. If it leaves the whole tree, the whole
tree withers <span id="fr_292"></span>[1](#fn_290). In exactly the same
manner, my son, know this.' Thus he spoke:

3\. 'This (body) indeed withers and dies when the living Self has left
it; the living Self dies not.

'That which is that subtile essence, in it all that exists has its self.
It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, *S*vetaketu, art it.'

'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.

'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_289"></span>[102:2](sbe01129.htm#fr_291) The next question
is: Waves, foam, and bubbles arise from the water, and. when they merge
again in the water, they are gone, How is it that living beings, when in
sleep or death they are merged again in the Sat, are not destroyed?

<span id="fn_290"></span>[103:1](sbe01129.htm#fr_292) The commentator
remarks that according to the Veda, trees are conscious, while Buddhists
and followers of Ka*n*âda hold them to be unconscious. They live,
because one sees how their sap runs and how it dries up, just as one
sees the sap in a living body, which, as we saw, was produced by food
and water. Therefore the simile holds good. The life, or, more
correctly, the liver, the living Self, pervades the tree, as it pervades
man, when it has entered the organism which produces breath, mind, and
speech. If any accident happens to a branch, the living Self draws
himself away from that branch, and then the branch withers. The sap
which caused the living Self to remain, goes, and the living Self goes
away with it. The same applies to the whole tree. The tree dies when the
living Self leaves it, but the living Self does not die; it only leaves
an abode which it had before occupied. Some other illustrations, to show
that the living Self remains, are added by the commentator: First, with
regard to the living Self being the same when it awakes from deep sleep
(sushupti), he remarks that we remember quite well that we have left
something unfinished before we fell asleep. And then with regard to the
living Self being the same when it awakes from death to a new life, he
shows that creatures, as soon as they are born take the breast, and
exhibit terror, which can only be explained, as he supposes, by their
possessing a recollection of a former state of existence.
