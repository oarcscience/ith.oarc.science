### THIRD KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_493.md).

1\. Tat savitur v*rin*îmahe (Rv. V, 82, 1-3) and adyâ no deva savitar
(Rv. V, 82, 4-6) are the beginning (pratipad) and the next step
(anu*k*ara) of the Vai*s*vadeva hymn, taken from the Ekâha ceremonial
and therefore proper <span id="fr_496"></span>[2](#fn_494.md).

2\. On that day <span id="fr_497"></span>[3](#fn_495.md) much is done now
and then which has to be hidden, and has to be atoned for. Atonement is
rest, the one-day sacrifice. Therefore at the end of the year the
sacrificers; rest on this atonement as their rest. He who knows this
rests firm, and they also for whom a Hot*ri* priest who knows this,
recites this hymn.

3\. Then (follows) the hymn addressed to Savit*ri*, tad devasya savitur
vâryam mahat (Rv. IV, 53). Verily, mahat, great, (in this foot) is the
end <span id="fr_498"></span>[4](#fn_496.md). This day too is the end. Thus
the verse is fit for the day.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

4\. The hymn katarâ pûrvâ katarâ parâyo*h* (Rv. I, 185), addressed to
Dyâvâp*ri*thivî, is one in which many verses have the same ending.
Verily, this day also (the mahâvrata) is one in which many receive the
same reward <span id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_497.md). Thus it is fit for
the day.

5\. The hymn ana*s*vo *g*âto anabhî*s*ur ukthya*h* (Rv. IV, 36) is
addressed to the *Ri*bhus.

6\. In the first verse the word tri (*k*akra*h*) occurs, and
trivat <span id="fr_500"></span>[2](#fn_498.md) is verily the end. This day
also is the end (of the sacrifice). Thus the verse is fit for the day.

7\. The hymn asya vâmasya palitasya hotu*h* (Rv. I, 164), addressed to
the Vi*s*vedevas, is multiform. This day also is multiform <span
id="fr_501"></span>[3](#fn_499.md). Thus the verse is fit for the day.

8\. He recites the end of it, beginning with gaurîr mimâya (Rv. I, 164,
41).

9\. The hymn â no bhadrâ*h* kratavo yantu vi*s*vata*h* (Rv. I, 89),
addressed to the Vi*s*vedevas, forms the Nividdhâna, taken from the
Ekâha ceremonial, and therefore proper.

10\. On that day much is done now and then which has to be hidden, and
has to be atoned for. Atonement is rest, the one-day sacrifice.
Therefore at the end of the year the sacrificers rest on this atonement
as their rest. He who knows this rests firm, and they also for whom a
Hot*ri* priest who knows this, recites this hymn.

11\. The hymn vai*s*vânarâya dhisha*n*âm *ri*tav*ri*dhe

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Rv. III, 2) forms
the beginning of the Âgnimâruta. Dhisha*n*â, thought, is verily the end,
this day also is the end. Thus it is fit for the day.

12\. The hymn praya*g*yavo maruto bhrâ*g*ad*ri*sh*t*aya*h* (Rv. V, 55),
addressed to the Maruts, is one in which many verses have the same
ending. Verily, this day also is one in which many receive the same
reward. Thus it is fit for the day <span
id="fr_502"></span>[1](#fn_500.md).

13\. He recites the verse *g*âtavedase sunavâma somam (Rv. I, 99, 1),
addressed to *G*âtavedas, before the (next following) hymn. That verse
addressed to *G*âtavedas is verily welfare, and leads to welfare. Thus
(by reciting it) he fares well <span id="fr_503"></span>[2](#fn_501.md).

14\. The hymn ima*m* stomam arhate *g*âtavedase (Rv. I, 94), addressed
to *G*âtavedas, is one in which many verses have the same ending.
Verily, this day also (the mahâvrata) is one in which many receive the
same reward. Thus it is fit for the day, yea, it is fit for the day.
