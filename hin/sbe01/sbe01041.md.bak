### SEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Let a man meditate on the fivefold Sâman, which is greater than
great, as the prâ*n*as (senses). The hiṅkâra is smell <span

the udgîtha sight (eye), the pratihâra hearing (ear), the nidhana mind.
These are one greater than the other.

2\. What is greater than great belongs to him, nay, he conquers the
worlds which are greater than

great, who knowing this meditates on the fivefold Sâman, which is
greater than great, as the prâ*n*as (senses).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_131"></span>[25:1](sbe01041.htm#fr_132.md) Prâ*n*a is
explained by ghrâ*n*a, smell; possibly ghrâ*n*a may have been the
original reading. Anyhow, it cannot be the mukhya prâ*n*a here, because
it is distinctly represented as the lowest sense.
