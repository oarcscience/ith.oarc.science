### ELEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. When from thence he has risen upwards, he neither rises nor sets. He
is alone, standing in the centre. And on this there is this verse:

2\. 'Yonder he neither rises nor sets at any time. If this is not true,
ye gods, may I lose Brahman.'

3\. And indeed to him who thus knows this Brahma-upanishad (the secret
doctrine: of the Veda) the sun does not rise and does not set. For him
there is day, once and for all <span id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_167.md).

4\. This doctrine (beginning with III, 1, 1) Brahman (m.
Hira*n*yagarbha) told to Pra*g*âpati (Virâ*g*), Pra*g*âpati to Manu,
Manu to his offspring (Ikshvâku, &c.) And the father told that (doctrine
of) Brahman (n.) to Uddâlaka Âru*n*i.

5\. A father may therefore tell that doctrine of Brahman to his eldest
son <span id="fr_169"></span>[2](#fn_168.md), or to a worthy pupil.

But no one should tell it to anybody else, even if he gave him the whole
sea-girt earth, full of treasure, for this doctrine is worth more than
that, yea, it is worth more.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_167"></span>[44:1](sbe01069.htm#fr_168.md) Cf. *Kh*. Up. VIII,
4, 2.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[44:2](sbe01069.htm#fr_169.md) This was the old,
not the present custom, says Ânandagiri. Not the father, but an
â*k*ârya, has now to teach his pupils.
