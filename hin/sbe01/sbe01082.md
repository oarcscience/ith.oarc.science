### FIFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. The bull of the herd (meant for Vâyu) said to him: 'Satyakâma!' He
replied: 'Sir!' The bull said: 'We have become a thousand, lead us to
the house of the teacher;

2\. 'And I will declare to you one foot of Brahman.'

'Declare it, Sir,' he replied.

He said to him: 'The eastern region is one quarter, the western region
is one quarter, the southern region is one quarter, the northern region
is one quarter. This is a foot of Brahman, consisting of the four
quarters, and called Prakâ*s*avat (endowed with splendour).

3\. 'He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting
of four quarters, by the name of Prakâ*s*avat, becomes endowed with
splendour in this world. He conquers the resplendent worlds, whoever
knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of the four
quarters, by the name of Prakâ*s*avat.
