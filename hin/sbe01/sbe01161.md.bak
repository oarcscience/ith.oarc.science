## EIGHTH PRAPÂ*TH*AKA.

### FIRST KHANDA <span id="fr_327"></span>[2](#fn_325.md).

1\. Hari*h*, Om. There is this city of Brahman (the body), and in it the
palace, the small lotus (of

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

the heart), and in it that small ether. Now what exists within that
small ether, that is to be sought for, that is to be understood.

2\. And if they should say to him: 'Now with regard to that city of
Brahman, and the palace in it, i. e. the small lotus of the heart, and
the small ether within the heart, what is there within it that deserves
to be sought for, or that is to be understood?'

3\. Then he should say: 'As large as this ether (all space) is, so large
is that ether within the heart. Both heaven and earth are contained
within it, both fire and air, both sun and moon, both lightning and
stars; and whatever there is of him (the Self) here in the world, and
whatever is not (i. e. whatever has been or will be), all that is
contained within it <span id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_326.md).'

4\. And if they should say to him: 'If everything that exists is
contained in that city of Brahman, all beings and all desires (whatever
can be imagined or desired), then what is left of it, when old age
reaches it and scatters it, or when it falls to pieces?'

5\. Then he should say: 'By the old age of the body, that (the ether, or
Brahman within it) does not age; by the death of the body, that (the
ether, or Brahman within it) is not killed. That (the Brahman)

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

is the true Brahma-city (not the body <span
id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_327).md). In it all desires are contained. It is
the Self, free from sin, free from old age, from death and grief, from
hunger and thirst, which desires nothing but what it ought to desire,
and imagines nothing but what it ought to imagine. Now as here on earth
people follow as they are commanded, and depend on the object which they
are attached to, be it a country or a piece of land,

6\. 'And as here on earth, whatever has been acquired by exertion,
perishes, so perishes whatever is acquired for the next world by
sacrifices and other good actions performed on earth. Those who depart
from hence without having discovered the Self and those true desires,
for them there is no freedom in all the worlds. But those who depart
from hence, after having discovered the Self and those true
desires <span id="fr_330"></span>[2](#fn_328.md), for them there is freedom
in all the worlds.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_325"></span>[125:2](sbe01161.htm#fr_327.md) The eighth
Prapâthaka seems to form a kind of appendix to the Upanishad. The
highest point that can be reached by speculation had been reached in the
seventh Prapâthaka, the identity of our self and of everything else with
the Highest Self. This speculative effort, however, is too much for
ordinary people. They cannot conceive the Sat or Brahman as out of space
and time, as free from all qualities, and in order to help them, they
are taught to adore the Brahman, as it appears in space and time, an
object endowed with certain qualities, living in nature and in the human
heart. The Highest Brahman, besides which there is nothing, and which
can neither be reached as an object, nor be considered as <span
id="page_126">p. 126</span> an effect, seems to ordinary minds like a
thing which is not. Therefore while the true philosopher, after
acquiring the knowledge of the Highest Sat, becomes identified with it
suddenly, like lightning, the ordinary mortal must reach it by slow
degrees, and as a preparation for that higher knowledge which is to
follow, the eighth Prapâthaka, particularly the first portion of it, has
been added to the teaching contained in the earlier books.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[126:1](sbe01161.htm#fr_328.md) The ether in the
heart is really a name of Brahman. He is there, and therefore all that
comes of him when he assumes bodily shapes, both what is and what is
not, i.e. what is no longer or not yet; for the absolute nothing is not
intended here.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[127:1](sbe01161.htm#fr_329.md) I translate this
somewhat differently from the commentator, though the argument remains
the same.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[127:2](sbe01161.htm#fr_330.md) True desires are
those which we ought to desire, and the fulfilment of which depends on
ourselves, supposing that we have acquired the knowledge which enables
us to fulfil them.
