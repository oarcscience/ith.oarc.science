### TWELFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Aupamanyava, whom do you meditate on as the Self?' He replied:
'Heaven only, venerable king.' He said: 'The Self which you meditate on
is the Vai*s*vânara Self, called Sute*g*as (having good light).
Therefore every kind of Soma libation is seen in your house <span

2\. 'You eat food, and see your desire (a son, &c.), and whoever thus
meditates on that Vai*s*vânara Self, eats food, sees his desire, and has
Vedic glory (arising from study and sacrifice) in his house. That,
however, is but the head of the Self, and thus your head would have
fallen (in a discussion), if you had not come to me.'
