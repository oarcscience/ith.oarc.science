### NINTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'For this reason is water in the fifth oblation called Man. This
germ, covered in the womb, having dwelt there ten months, or more or
less, is born.

2\. 'When born, he lives whatever the length of his life may be. When he
has departed, his friends carry him, as appointed, to the fire (of the
funeral pile) from whence he came, from whence he sprang.
