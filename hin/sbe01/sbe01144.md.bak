*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### TENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Water (ap) is better than food. Therefore if there is not
sufficient rain, the vital spirits fail from fear that there will be
less food. But if there is sufficient rain, the vital spirits rejoice,
because there will be much food. This water, on assuming different
forms, becomes this earth, this sky, this heaven, the mountains, gods
and men, cattle, birds, herbs and trees, all beasts down to worms,
midges, and ants. Water indeed assumes all these forms. Meditate on
water.

2\. 'He who meditates on water as Brahman, obtains all wishes, he
becomes satisfied; he is, as it were, lord and master as far as water
reaches--he who meditates on water as Brahman.'

'Sir, is there something better than water?'

'Yes, there is something better than water.'

'Sir, tell it me.'
