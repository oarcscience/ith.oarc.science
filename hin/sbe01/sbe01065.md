Textual Heritage

### SEVENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. On the second of these nectars the Rudras live, with Indra at their
head. True, the Devas do not eat or drink, but they enjoy by seeing the
nectar.

2\. They enter into that white colour, and they rise from that colour.

3\. He who thus knows this nectar, becomes one of the Rudras, with Indra
at their head, he sees the

nectar and rejoices. And he, having entered that colour, rises again
from that colour.

4\. So long as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, twice as
long does it rise in the south and set in the north; and so long does he
follow the sovereign supremacy of the Rudras.
