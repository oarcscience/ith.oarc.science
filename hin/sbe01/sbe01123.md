Textual Heritage

### FIFTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'The earth (food) when eaten becomes threefold; its grossest portion
becomes feces, its middle portion flesh, its subtilest portion mind.

2\. 'Water when drunk becomes threefold; its grossest portion becomes
water, its middle portion blood, its subtilest portion breath.

3\. 'Fire (i. e. in oil, butter, &c.) when eaten becomes threefold; its
grossest portion becomes bone, its middle portion marrow, its subtilest
portion speech <span id="fr_282"></span>[2](#fn_280).

4\. 'For truly, my child, mind comes of earth, breath of water, speech
of fire.'

'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.

Be it so, my child,' the father replied.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_280"></span>[96:2](sbe01123.htm#fr_282) Food, water, and
fire are each to be taken as tripartite; hence animals which live on one
of the three elements only, still share in some measure the qualities of
the other elements also.
