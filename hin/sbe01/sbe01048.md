### FOURTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Rising, the sun is the hiṅkâra, risen, he is the prastâva, at noon
he is the udgîtha, in the afternoon he is the pratihâra, setting, he is
the nidhana. That is the B*ri*hat Sâman as interwoven in the sun <span
id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_145.md).

2\. He who thus knows the B*ri*hat as interwoven in the sun, becomes
refulgent <span id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_146.md) and strong, he reaches
the full life, he lives long, becomes great with children and cattle,
great by fame. His rule is, 'Never complain of the heat of the sun.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_145"></span>[30:1](sbe01048.htm#fr_146.md) The sun is
b*ri*hat. The B*ri*hat Sâman is to be looked upon as the sun, or the
B*ri*hat has Âditya for its deity.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[30:2](sbe01048.htm#fr_147.md) The same as
brahmavar*k*asin.
