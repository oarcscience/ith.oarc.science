### FOURTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Some say: 'Let the swing be one ell (aratni) above the ground, for
by that measure verily the Svarga worlds are measured.' That is not to
be regarded.

2\. Others say: 'Let it be one span (prâde*s*a), for by that measure
verily the vital airs were measured.' That is not to be regarded <span
id="fr_421"></span>[1](#fn_419.md).

3\. Let it be one fist (mush*t*i), for by that measure verily all
eatable food is made, and by that measure

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

all eatable food is taken; therefore let it be one fist above the
ground.

4\. They say: 'Let him mount the swing from east to west, like he who
shines; for the sun mounts these worlds from east to west.' That is not
to be regarded.

5\. Others say: 'Let him mount the swing sideways, for people mount a
horse sideways <span id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_420.md), thinking that thus
they will obtain all desires.' That is not to be regarded.

6\. They say: 'Let him mount the swing <span
id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_421.md) from behind, for people mount a ship
from behind, and this swing is a ship in which to go to heaven.'
Therefore let him mount it from behind.

7\. Let him touch the swing with his chin (*kh*ubuka). The parrot
(*s*uka) thus mounts a tree, and he is of all birds the one who eats
most food. Therefore let him touch it with his chin.

8\. Let him mount the swing with his arms <span
id="fr_424"></span>[3](#fn_422.md). The hawk swoops thus on birds and on
trees, and he is of all birds the strongest. Therefore let him mount
with his arms.

9\. Let him not withdraw one foot (the right or left) from the earth,
for fear that he may lose his hold.

10\. The Hot*ri* mounts the swing, the Udgât*ri* the seat made of
Udumbara wood. The swing is masculine, the seat feminine, and they form
a union. Thus he makes a union at the beginning of the uktha in order to
get offspring.

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

He who knows this, gets offspring and cattle.

12\. Next the swing is food, the seat fortune. Thus he mounts and
obtains food and fortune.

13\. The Hotrakas (the Prasâst*ri*, Brâhma*n*â*kkh*a*m*sin, Pot*ri*,
Nesh*t*ri, Agnâdhra, and A*kkh*âvâka) together with the Brahman sit down
on cushions made of grass, reeds, leaves, &c.

14\. Plants and trees, after they have grown up, bear fruit. Thus if the
priests mount on that day altogether (on their seats), they mount on
solid and fluid as their proper food. Therefore this serves for the
attainment of solid as proper food <span
id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_423.md).

15\. Some say: 'Let him descend after saying vasha*t* <span
id="fr_426"></span>[2](#fn_424.md). 'That is not to be regarded. For,
verily, that respect is not shown which is shown to one who does not see
it <span id="fr_427"></span>[3](#fn_425.md).

16\. Others say: 'Let him descend after he has taken the food in his
hand.' That is not to be regarded. For, verily, that respect is not
shown which is shown to one after he has approached quite close.

17\. Let him descend after he has seen the food. For, verily, that is
real respect which is shown to one when he sees it. Only after having
actually

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

seen the food (that is brought to the sacrifice), let him descend from
the swing.

18\. Let him descend turning towards the east, for in the east the seed
of the gods springs up <span id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_426.md). Therefore
let him rise turning towards the east, yea, turning towards the east.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_419"></span>[173:1](sbe01187.htm#fr_421.md) They rise one span
above the heart, and they proceed one span from out the mouth. Comm.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[174:1](sbe01187.htm#fr_422.md) Here we have
clearly riding on horseback.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[174:2](sbe01187.htm#fr_423.md) While the swing
points to the east, let him stand west, and thus mount.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[174:3](sbe01187.htm#fr_424.md) The fore-arms,
from the elbow to the end, the aratnî. Comm.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[175:1](sbe01187.htm#fr_425.md) One expects
isha*h* before ûr*g*a*h*, but it is wanting in both text and commentary,
and in other MSS. also.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[175:2](sbe01187.htm#fr_426.md) The word by which
the Hot*ri* invites the Adhvaryu to offer the oblation to the gods. The
descending from the swing belongs, of course, to a later part of the
sacrifice.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[175:3](sbe01187.htm#fr_427.md) it is supposed
that the Hot*ri* rises from the swing to show respect to the sacrificial
food, when it is brought near. But as it is not brought near,
immediately after the Hot*ri* has finished his part with the word
vasha*t*, the food could not see the Hot*ri* rise, and this mark of
respect, intended for the food, would thus be lost.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[176:1](sbe01187.htm#fr_428.md) Should it be
devareta*h* sampra*g*âyate, or devaretasam pra*g*âyate?
