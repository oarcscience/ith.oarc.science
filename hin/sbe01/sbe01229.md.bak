### SECOND KHA*ND*A.

1\. Next comes the meditation as taught by *S*âkalya.

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

2\. The first half is the earth, the second half heaven, their uniting
the rain, the uniter Par*g*anya <span id="fr_631"></span>[1](#fn_629.md).

3\. And so it is when he (Par*g*anya) rains thus strongly, without
ceasing, day and night <span id="fr_632"></span>[2](#fn_630.md),

4\. Then they say also (in ordinary language), 'Heaven and earth have
come together.'

5\. So much with regard to the deities; now with regard to the body:--

6\. Every man is indeed like an egg <span
id="fr_633"></span>[3](#fn_631.md). There are two halves <span
id="fr_634"></span>[4](#fn_632) (of him.md), thus they say: 'This half is
the earth, that half heaven.' And there between them is the ether (the
space of the mouth), like the ether between heaven and earth. In this
ether there (in the mouth) the breath is fixed, as in that other ether
the air is fixed. And as there are those three luminaries (in heaven),
there are these three luminaries in man.

7\. As there is that sun in heaven, there is this eye in the head. As
there is that lightning in the sky, there is this heart in the body; as
there is that fire on earth, there is this seed in the member.

8\. Having thus represented the self (body) as the whole world,
*S*âkalya said: This half is the earth, that half heaven.

9\. He who thus knows this union, becomes united with offspring, cattle,
fame, glory of countenance,

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

and the world of Svarga. He lives his full age.

### THIRD KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_635"></span>[1](#fn_633.md).

1\. Next come the reciters of the Nirbhu*g*a <span
id="fr_636"></span>[2](#fn_634.md).

2\. Nirbhu*g*a abides on earth, Prat*rinn*a in heaven, the
Ubhayamantare*n*a in the sky.

3\. Now, if any one should chide him who recites the Nirbhu*g*a, let him
answer: 'Thou art fallen from the two lower places <span
id="fr_637"></span>[3](#fn_635.md).' If any one should chide him who
recites the Prat*rinn*a, let him answer: 'Thou art fallen from the two
higher places <span id="fr_638"></span>[4](#fn_636.md).' But he who recites
the Ubhayamantare*n*a, there is no chiding him.

4\. For when he turns out the Sandhi (the union of words), that is the
form of Nirbhu*g*a <span id="fr_639"></span>[5](#fn_637.md); and when be
pronounces two syllables pure (without modification), that is the form
of Prat*rinn*a <span id="fr_640"></span>[6](#fn_638.md). This comes

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

first <span id="fr_641"></span>[1](#fn_639.md). By the Ubhayamantara (what
is between the two) both are fulfilled (both the sandhi and the pada).

5\. Let him who wishes for proper food say the Nirbhu*g*a; let him who
wishes for Svarga, say the Prat*rinn*a; let him who wishes for both say
the Ubhayamantare*n*a.

6\. Now if another man (an enemy) should chide him who says the
Nirbhu*g*a, let him say to him: 'Thou hast offended the earth, the
deity; the earth, the deity, will strike thee.'

If another man should chide him who says the Prat*rinn*a, let him say to
him: 'Thou hast offended heaven, the deity; heaven, the deity, will
strike thee.'

If another man should chide him who says the Ubhayamantare*n*a, let him
say to him: 'Thou hast offended the sky, the deity; the sky, the deity,
will strike thee.'

7\. And whatever the reciter shall say to one who speaks to him or does
not speak to him, depend upon it, it will come to pass.

8\. But to a Brâhma*n*a let him not say anything except what is
auspicious.

9\. Only he may curse a Brâhma*n*a in excessive wealth <span
id="fr_642"></span>[2](#fn_640.md).

10\. Nay, not even in excessive wealth should he curse a Brâhma*n*a, but
he should say, 'I bow before Brâhma*n*as,'--thus says *S*ûravîra
Mâ*nd*ûkeya.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_624"></span>[248:1](sbe01228.htm#fr_626.md) Both views are
tenable, for it is not the actual air and ether which are meditated on,
but their names, as declared and explained in this peculiar act of
worship. We should read âkâ*s*a*sk*eti, a reading confirmed both by the
commentary and by the Kashmir MS.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[248:2](sbe01228.htm#fr_627.md) The man among
heroes. Comm.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[248:3](sbe01228.htm#fr_628.md) The Kashmir MS.
reads manasaivâgre.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[248:4](sbe01228.htm#fr_629.md) Both views are
admissible. Comm.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[248:5](sbe01228.htm#fr_630.md) Prâ*n*asa*m*hitah,
Kashmir MS.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[249:1](sbe01229.htm#fr_631.md) If i is followed
by a, the i is changed to y, and both are united as ya. Here a is the
cause which changes i into y. Thus Par*g*anya, the god of rain, is the
cause which unites earth and heaven into rain. Comm.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[249:2](sbe01229.htm#fr_632.md) When it rains
incessantly, heaven and earth seem to be one in rain.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[249:3](sbe01229.htm#fr_633.md) Ândam,
a*nd*asad*ris*am. Comm.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[249:4](sbe01229.htm#fr_634.md) The one half from
the feet to the lower jaw, the other half from the upper jaw to the
skull. Comm.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[250:1](sbe01229.htm#fr_635.md) Cf.
Rig-veda-prâti*s*âkhya, ed. Max Müller, p. iii, and Nachträge, p. ii.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[250:2](sbe01229.htm#fr_636) Nirbhu*g*a(n.md) is
the recitation of the Veda without intervals, therefore the same as
Sa*m*hitâ. Prat*rinn*a is the recitation of each word by itself
(pada-pâ*th*a); Ubhayamantarena, the between the two, is the
intertwining of Sa*m*hitâ and Pada-pâ*th*a, the so-called Krama-pâ*th*a.
By reciting the Sa*m*hitâ inattentively, one may use forms which belong
to the Pada-text; and by reciting the Pada inattentively, one may use
forms which belong to the Sa*m*hitâ-text. But in reciting the Krama both
the Sa*m*hitâ and Pada forms are used together, and therefore mistakes
are less likely to happen.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[250:3](sbe01229.htm#fr_637.md) From earth and
sky. Cf. *Kh*. Up. II, 22, 3.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[250:4](sbe01229.htm#fr_638.md) From the sky and
from heaven.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[250:5](sbe01229.htm#fr_639.md) Nirbhu*g*a may
mean without arms, as if the arms of the words were taken away, or with
two arms stretched out, the two words forming, as it were, two arms to
one body.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[250:6](sbe01229.htm#fr_640.md) Prat*rinn*a means
cut asunder, every word being separated from the others.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[251:1](sbe01229.htm#fr_641.md) The words were
first each separate, before they were united according to the laws of
Sandhi.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[251:2](sbe01229.htm#fr_642.md) He may curse him,
if he is exceeding rich; or he may wish him the curse of excessive
wealth; or he may curse him, if something great depends on it.
