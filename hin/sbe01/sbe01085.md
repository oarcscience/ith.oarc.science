*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### EIGHTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'A diver-bird (Madgu, meant for Prâ*n*a) will declare to you another
foot of Brahman.'

(After these words of the Ha*m*sa), Satyakâma, on the morrow, drove the
cows onward. And when they came towards the evening, he lighted a fire,
penned the cows, laid wood on the fire, and sat down behind the fire,
looking toward the east.

2\. Then a diver flew near and said to him 'Satyakâma.' He replied:
'Sir.'

3\. The diver said: 'Friend, I will declare unto you one foot of
Brahman!

'Declare it, Sir,' he replied.

He said to him: 'Breath is one quarter, the eye is one quarter, the ear
is one quarter, the mind is one quarter. This is a foot of Brahman,
consisting of four quarters, and called Âyatanavat (having a home).

'He who knows this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of
four quarters, by the name of Âyatanavat, becomes possessed of a home in
this world. He conquers the worlds which offer a home, whoever knows
this and meditates on the foot of Brahman, consisting of four quarters,
by the name of Âyatanavat.'
