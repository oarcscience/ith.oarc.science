*The Upanishads, Part 1 (SBE01)*, by Max Müller, \[1879\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### FIFTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Then he said to *G*ana *S*ârkarâkshya: 'Whom do you meditate on as
the Self?' He replied: 'Ether only, venerable king.' He said: 'The Self
which you meditate on is the Vai*s*vânara Self, called Bahula (full).
Therefore you are full of offspring and wealth.

2\. 'You eat food and see your desire, and whoever thus meditates on
that Vai*s*vânara Self, eats food and sees his desire, and has Vedic
glory in his house.

'That, however, is but the trunk of the Self, and your trunk would have
perished, if you had not come to me.'
