### SIXTEENTH KHA*ND*A <span id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_299.md).

1\. 'My child, they bring a man hither whom they have taken by the hand,
and they say: "He has taken something, he has committed a theft." (When

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

he denies, they say), "Heat the hatchet for him." If he committed the
theft, then he makes himself to be what he is not. Then the
false-minded, having covered his true Self by a falsehood, grasps the
heated hatchet--he is burnt, and he is killed.

2\. 'But if he did not commit the theft, then he makes himself to be
what he is. Then the true-minded, having covered his true Self by truth,
grasps the heated hatchet--he is not burnt, and he is delivered.

'As that (truthful) man is not burnt, thus has all that exists its self
in That. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O *S*vetaketu, art
it.' He understood what he said, yea, he understood it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_299"></span>[108:1](sbe01134.htm#fr_301.md) The next question
is: Why does he who knows, on obtaining the Sat, not return, while he
who does not know, though obtaining the Sat in death, returns? An
illustration is chosen which is intended to show how knowledge produces
a material effect. The belief in the efficacy of ordeals must have
existed at the time, and appealing to that belief, the teacher says that
the man who knows himself guilty, is really burnt by the heated iron,
while the man who knows himself innocent, is not. In the same manner the
man who knows his Self to be the true Self, on approaching after death
the true Self, is not repelled and sent back into a new existence, while
he who does not know, is sent back into a new round of births and
deaths. The man who tells a falsehood about himself, loses his true Self
and is burnt; the man who has a false conception about his Self, loses
likewise his true Self, and not knowing the true Self, even though
approaching it in death, he has to suffer till he acquires some day the
true knowledge.
