### THIRD KHA*ND*A.

Now follows the meditation on the udgîtha with reference to the gods.
Let a man meditate on the udgîtha (Om) as he who sends warmth (the sun
in the sky). When the sun rises it sings as Udgât*ri* for the sake of
all creatures. When it rises it destroys the fear of darkness. He who
knows this, is able to destroy the fear of darkness (ignorance).

2\. This (the breath in the mouth) and that (the sun) are the same. This
is hot and that is hot. This they call svara (sound), and that they call
pratyâsvara <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_85) (reflected sound.md).
Therefore let a man meditate on the udgîtha (Om) as this and that (as
breath and as sun).

3\. Then let a man meditate on the udgîtha (Om) as vyâna indeed. If we
breathe up, that is prâ*n*a, the up-breathing. If we breathe down, that
is apâna, the down-breathing. The combination of prâ*n*a and apâna is
vyâna, back-breathing or holding in of the breath. This vyâna is speech.
Therefore when we utter speech, we neither breathe up nor down.

4\. Speech is *Rik*, and therefore when a man utters a *Rik* verse he
neither breathes up nor down.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

*Rik* is Sâman, and therefore when a man utters a Sâman verse he neither
breathes up nor down.

Sâman is udgîtha, and therefore when a man sings (the udgîtha, Om) he
neither breathes up nor down.

5\. And other works also which require strength, such as the production
of fire by rubbing, running a race, stringing a strong bow, are
performed without breathing up or down. Therefore let a man meditate on
the udgîtha (Om) as vyâna.

6\. Let a man meditate on the syllables of the udgîtha, i. e. of the
word udgîtha. Ut is breath (prâ*n*a), for by means of breath a man rises
(uttish*th*ati). Gî is speech, for speeches are called gira*h*. Tha is
food, for by means of food all subsists (sthita).

7\. Ut is heaven, gî the sky, tha the earth. Ut is the sun, gî the air,
tha the fire. Ut is the Sâma-veda,, gî the Ya*g*ur-veda, tha the
Rig-veda <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_86.md).

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Speech yields the
milk, which is the milk of speech itself <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_87.md), to him who thus knowing meditates on
those

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

syllables of the name of udgîtha, he becomes rich in food and able to
eat food.

8\. Next follows the fulfilment of prayers. Let a man thus meditate on
the Upasara*n*as, i. e. the objects which have to be approached by
meditation: Let him (the Udgât*ri*) quickly reflect on the Sâman with
which he is going to praise;

9\. Let him quickly reflect on the *Rik* in which that Sâman occurs; on
the *Ri*shi (poet) by whom it was seen or composed; on the Devatâ
(object) which he is going to praise;

10\. On the metre in which he is going to praise; on the tune with which
he is going to sing for himself;

11\. On the quarter of the world which he is going to praise. Lastly,
having approached himself (his name, family, &c.) by meditation, let him
sing the hymn of praise, reflecting on his desire, and avoiding all
mistakes in pronunciation, &c. Quickly <span
id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) will the desire be then fulfilled to him,
for the sake of which he may have offered his hymn of praise, yea, for
which he may have offered his hymn of praise <span
id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_89.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_85"></span>[7:1](sbe01024.htm#fr_86.md) As applied to breath,
svara is explained by the commentator in the sense of moving, going out;
pratyâsvara, as applied to the sun, is explained as returning every day.
More likely, however, svara as applied to breath means sound, Om itself
being called svara (*Kh*. Up. I, 4, 3), and prasvâra in the
Rig-veda-prâti*s*âkhya, 882. As applied to the sun, svara and
pratyâsvara were probably taken in the sense of light and reflected
light.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[8:1](sbe01024.htm#fr_87.md) The commentator
supplies explanations to all these fanciful etymologies. The heaven is
ut, because it is high; the sky is gî, because it gives out all the
worlds (gira*n*ât); earth is tha, because it is the place (sthâna) of
living beings. The sun is ut, because it is high. The wind is gî,
because it gives out fire, &c. (gira*n*ât); fire is tha, because it is
the place (sthâna) of the sacrifice. The Sâma-veda is ut, because it is
praised as svarga; the Ya*g*ur-veda is gî, because the gods take the
oblation offered with a Ya*g*us; the Rig-veda is tha, because the Sâma
verses stand in it. All this is very childish, and worse than childish,
but it is interesting as a phase of human folly which is not restricted
to the Brahmans of India. I take the following passage from an
interesting article, 'On the Ogam Beithluisnin and on Scythian Letters,'
by Dr. Charles Graves, Bishop of Limerick. 'An Irish antiquary,' he
says, 'writing several hundred years ago, proposes to give an account of
the origin of the names of the notes in the musical scale.

'"It is asked here, according to Saint Augustine, What is chanting, or
why is it so called? Answer. From this word *cantalena*; <span
id="page_9">p. 9</span> and *cantalena* is the same thing as *lenis
cantus*, i. e. a soft, sweet chant to God, and to the Virgin Mary, and
to all the Saints. And the reason why the word *puinec* (*puncta*) is so
called is because the points (or musical notes) *ut, re, mi, fa, sol,
la*, hurt the devil and puncture him. And it is thus that these points
are to be understood: viz. When Moses the son of Amram, with his people
in their Exodus was crossing the Red Sea, and Pharaoh and his host were
following him, this was the chant which Moses had to protect him from
Pharaoh and his host--these six points in praise of the Lord:--

'"The first point of these, i. e. *ut*: and *ut* in the Greek is the
same as *liberat* in the Latin; and that is the same as *saer* in the
Gaelic; i.e. O God, said Moses, deliver us from the harm of the devil.

"'The second point of them, i.e. *re*: and *re* is the same as *saer*;
i. e. O God, deliver us from everything hurtful and malignant.

'"The third point, i.e. *mi*: and *mi* in the Greek is the same as
*militum* in the Latin; and that is the same as *ridere* (a knight) in
the Gaelic; i. e. O God, said Moses, deliver us from those knights who
are pursuing us.

'"The fourth point, i.e. *fa*: and *fa* in the Greek is the same as
*famulus* in the Latin; and that is the same as *mug* (slave) in the
Gaelic; i. e. O God, said Moses, deliver us from those slaves who are
pursuing us.

'"The fifth point, i.e. *sol*: and *sol* is the same as *grian* (sun);
and that is the same as righteousness; because righteousness and Christ
are not different; i. e. O Christ, said Moses, deliver us.

'"The sixth point, i. e. *la*, is the same as *lav*; and that is the
same as *indail* (wash); i.e. O God, said Moses, wash away our sins from
us.

'"And on the singing of that laud Pharaoh and his host were drowned.

'"Understand, O man, that in whatever place this laud, i. e. this chant,
is sung, the devil is bound by it, and his power is extirpated thence,
and the power of God is called in."

'We have been taught that the names of the first six notes <span
id="page_10">p. 10</span> in the gamut were suggested by the initial
syllables of the first six hemistichs in one of the stanzas of a hymn to
St. John:

*Ut* queant laxis  
*Re*sonare fibris  
*Mi*ra gestorum  
*Fa*muli tuorum,  
*So*lve polluti  
*La*bii reatum,  
       *S*ancte *I*oannes.'

<span id="fn_87"></span>[9:1](sbe01024.htm#fr_88.md) The milk of speech
consists in rewards to be obtained by the Rig-veda, &c. Or we may
translate, Speech yields its milk to him who is able to milk speech.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[10:1](sbe01024.htm#fr_89.md) Abhyâ*s*o ha yat,
lit. depend on it that it will be fulfilled, but always explained by
quickly. See *Kh*. Up. II, 1, 4; III, 19, 4; V, 10, 7. Frequently, but
wrongly, written with a dental s.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[10:2](sbe01024.htm#fr_90.md) The repetition of the
last sentence is always an indication that a chapter is finished. This
old division into chapters is of great importance for a proper study of
the Upanishads.
