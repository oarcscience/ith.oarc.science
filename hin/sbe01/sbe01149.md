### FIFTEENTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'Spirit <span id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_314) (prâ*n*a) is better
than hope. As the spokes of a wheel hold to the nave <span
id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_315), so does all this (beginning with names
and ending in hope) hold to spirit. That spirit moves by the spirit, it
gives spirit to the spirit. Father means spirit, mother is spirit,
brother is spirit, sister is spirit, tutor is spirit, Brâhma*n*a is
spirit.

2\. 'For if one says anything unbecoming to a father, mother, brother,
sister, tutor or Brâhma*n*a, then people say, Shame on thee! thou hast
offended thy father, mother, brother, sister, tutor, or a Brâhma*n*a.

3\. 'But, if after the spirit has departed from them, one shoves them
together with a poker, and burns them to pieces, no one would say, Thou
offendest thy father, mother, brother, sister, tutor or a Brâhma*n*a.

4\. 'Spirit then is all this. He who sees this, perceives this, and
understands this, becomes an ativâdin <span
id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_316). If people say to such a man, Thou

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

art an ativâdin, he may say, I am an ativâdin; he need not deny it.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_314"></span>[120:1](sbe01149.htm#fr_316) Prâ*n*a is used
here in a technical sense. It does not mean simply breath, but the
spirit, the conscious self (pra*g*ñâtman) which, as we saw, enters the
body in order to reveal the whole variety of forms and names. It is in
one sense the mukhya prâ*n*a.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[120:2](sbe01149.htm#fr_317) The commentary
carries the simile Still further. The felloe he says, holds to the
spokes, the spokes to the nave. So do the bhûtamâtrâs hold to the
pra*g*ñâmâtrâs, and these to the prâ*n*a.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[120:3](sbe01149.htm#fr_318) One who declares
something that goes beyond all the declarations made before, beginning
with the declaration that names are Brahman, and ending with the
declaration that hope is Brahman;--one who knows that prâ*n*a, spirit,
the conscious self, is Brahman. This declaration represents the highest
point reached by ordinary people, but Nârada wishes to go beyond. In the
Mu*nd*aka, III, 1, 4, an ativâdin is contrasted with one who really
knows the highest truth.
