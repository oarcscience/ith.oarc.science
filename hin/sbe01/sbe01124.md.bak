### SIXTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. 'That which is the subtile portion of curds, when churned, rises
upwards, and becomes butter.

2\. 'In the same manner, my child, the subtile portion of earth (food),
when eaten, rises upwards, and becomes mind.

3\. 'That which is the subtile portion of water, when drunk, rises
upwards, and becomes breath.

4\. 'That which is the subtile portion of fire, when consumed, rises
upwards, and becomes speech.

5\. 'For mind, my child, comes of earth, breath of water, speech of
fire.'

'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.

'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.
