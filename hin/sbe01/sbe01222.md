## FOURTH ADHYÂYA.

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

With this adhyâya begins the real Upanishad, best known under the name
of the Aitareya-upanishad, and often separately edited, commented on,
and translated. If treated separately, what we call the fourth adhyâya
of the second Âra*n*yaka, becomes the first adhyâya of the Upanishad,
sometimes also, by counting all adhyâya from the beginning of the
Aitareya-âranyaka, the ninth. The divisions adopted by Sâya*n*a, who
explains the Upanishad as part of the Âra*n*yaka, and by *S*aṅkara, who
explains it independently, vary, though Sâya*n*a states that he follows
in his commentary on the Upanishad the earlier commentary of *S*aṅkara.
I have given the divisions adopted by Sâya*n*a, and have marked those of
*S*aṅkara's by figures in parentheses, placed at the end of each
paragraph. The difference between this Upanishad and the three preceding
adhyâyas is easily perceived. Hitherto the answer to the question,
Whence this world? had been, From Prâ*n*a, prâ*n*a meaning breath and
life, which was looked upon for a time as a sufficient explanation of
all that is. From a psychological point of view this prâ*n*a is the
conscious self (pra*g*ñâtman); in a more mythological form it appears as
Hira*n*yagarbha, 'the golden germ,' sometimes even as Indra. It is one
of the chief objects of the prâ*n*avidyâ, or life-knowledge, to show
that the living principle in us is the same as the living principle in
the sun, and that by a recognition of their identity and of the true
nature of prâ*n*a, the devotee, or he who has rightly meditated on
prâ*n*a during his life, enters after death into the world of
Hira*n*yagarbha.

This is well expressed in the Kaushîtaki-upanishad III, 2, where Indra
says to Pratardana: 'I am Prâ*n*a; meditate on me as the conscious self
(pra*g*ñâtman), as life, as immortality. Life is prâ*n*a, prâ*n*a is
life. Immortality is prâ*n*a, prâ*n*a is immortality. By prâ*n*a he
obtains immortality in the other world, by knowledge (pra*g*ñâ) true
conception. Prâ*n*a is consciousness (pra*g*ñâ), consciousness is
prâ*n*a.'

This, however, though it may have satisfied the mind of the Brahmans for
a time, was not a final solution. That final solution of the problem not
simply of life, but of existence, is given in the Upanishad which
teaches that Âtman, the Self, and not Prâ*n*a, Life, is the last and
only cause of everything. In some places this

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

doctrine is laid down in all its simplicity. Our true self, it is said,
has its true being in the Highest Self only. In other passages, however,
and nearly in the whole of this Upanishad, this simple doctrine is mixed
up with much that is mythological, fanciful, and absurd, arthavâda, as
the commentators call it, but as it might often be more truly called,
anarthavâda, and it is only towards the end that the identity of the
self-conscious self with the Highest Self or Brahman is clearly
enuntiated.

 

Adoration to the Highest Self. Hari, Om!

1\. Verily, in the beginning <span id="fr_585"></span>[1](#fn_583.md) all
this was Self, one only; there was nothing else blinking <span
id="fr_586"></span>[2](#fn_584.md) whatsoever.

2\. He thought: 'Shall I send forth worlds?' (1) He sent forth these
worlds,

3\. Ambhas (water), Marî*k*i (light), Mara (mortal), and Ap (water).

4\. That Ambhas (water) is above the heaven, and it is heaven, the
support. The Marî*k*is (the lights) are the sky. The Mara (mortal) is
the earth, and the waters under the earth are the Ap world <span
id="fr_587"></span>[3](#fn_585). (2.md)

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

5\. He thought: 'There are these worlds; shall I send forth guardians of
the worlds?'

He then formed the Purusha (the person) <span
id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_586.md), taking him forth from the water <span
id="fr_589"></span>[2](#fn_587). (3.md)

6\. He brooded on him <span id="fr_590"></span>[3](#fn_588.md), and when
that person had thus been brooded on, a mouth burst forth <span
id="fr_591"></span>[4](#fn_589.md) like an egg. From the mouth proceeded
speech, from speech Agni (fire) <span id="fr_592"></span>[5](#fn_590.md).

Nostrils burst forth. From the nostrils proceeded scent (prâ*n*a) <span
id="fr_593"></span>[6](#fn_591), from scent Vâyu (air.md).

Eyes burst forth. From the eyes proceeded sight, from sight Âditya
(sun).

Ears burst forth. From the ears proceeded hearing, from hearing the
Di*s* (quarters of the world),

Skin burst forth. From the skin proceeded hairs (sense of touch), from
the hairs shrubs and trees.

The heart burst forth. From the heart proceeded mind, from mind
*K*andramas (moon).

The navel burst forth. From the navel proceeded the Apâna (the
down-breathing) <span id="fr_594"></span>[7](#fn_592.md), from Apâna death.

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

The generative organ burst forth. From the organ proceeded seed, from
seed water. (4)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_583"></span>[237:1](sbe01222.htm#fr_585.md) Before the
creation. Comm.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[237:2](sbe01222.htm#fr_586.md) Blinking, mishat,
i. e. living; cf. Rv. X, 190, 2, vi*s*vasya mishato va*s*î, the lord of
all living. Sâya*n*a seems to take mishat as a 3rd pers. sing.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[237:3](sbe01222.htm#fr_587.md) The names of the
four worlds are peculiar. Ambhas means water, and is the name given to
the highest world, the waters above the heaven, and heaven itself.
Marî*k*is are rays, here used as a name of the sky, antariksha. Mara
means dying, and the earth is called so, because all creatures living
there must die. Ap is water, here explained as the waters under the
earth. The usual division of the world is threefold, earth, sky, and
heaven. Here it is fourfold, the fourth division being the water round
the earth, or, as the commentator says, under the earth. Ambhas was
probably intended for the highest heaven (dyaus), and was then explained
both as what is above the heaven and as heaven itself, the support. If
we translate, like *S*aṅkara and Colebrooke, I the water is the region
above the heaven which heaven upholds,' we should lose heaven
altogether, yet heaven, as the third with sky and earth, is essential in
the Indian view of the world.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[238:1](sbe01222.htm#fr_588.md) Purusha; an
embodied being, Colebrooke; a being of human shape, Röer; purushâkâram
virâ*t*pi*nd*am, Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[238:2](sbe01222.htm#fr_589.md) According to the
commentator, from the five elements, beginning with water. That person
is meant for the Virâ*g*.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[238:3](sbe01222.htm#fr_590.md) Tap, as the
commentator observes, does not mean here and in similar passages to
perform austerities (tapas), such as the K*rikkh*ra, the *K*ândrâya*n*a,
&c., but to conceive and to will and to create by mere will. I have
translated it by brooding, though this expresses a part only of the
meaning expressed by tap.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[238:4](sbe01222.htm#fr_591.md) Literally, was
opened.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[238:5](sbe01222.htm#fr_592.md) Three things are
always distinguished here--the place of each sense, the instrument of
the sense, and the presiding deity of the sense.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[238:6](sbe01222.htm#fr_593.md) Prâ*n*a, i. e.
ghrâ*n*endriya, must be distinguished from the prâ*n*a, the
up-breathing, one of the five prâ*n*as, and likewise from the prâ*n*a as
the principle of life.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[238:7](sbe01222.htm#fr_594.md) The Apâna,
down-breathing, is generally one of the five vital airs <span
id="page_239">p. 239</span> which are supposed to keep the body alive.
in our place, however, apâna is deglutition and digestion, as we shall
see in II, 4, 3, 10.
