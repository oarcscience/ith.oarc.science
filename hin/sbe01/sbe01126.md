### EIGHTH KHA*ND*A.

1\. Uddâlaka Âru*n*i said to his son *S*vetaketu:

Learn from me the true nature of sleep (svapna). When a man sleeps here,
then, my dear son, he becomes united with the True <span
id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_282), he is gone to his

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

own (Self). Therefore they say, svapiti, he sleeps, because he is gone
(apîta) to his own (sva) <span id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_283).

2\. 'As a bird when tied by a string flies first in every direction, and
finding no rest anywhere, settles down at last on the very place where
it is fastened, exactly in the same manner, my son, that mind (the
*g*îva, or living Self in the mind, see VI, 3, 2), after flying in every
direction, and finding no rest anywhere, settles down on breath <span
id="fr_286"></span>[2](#fn_284); for indeed, my son, mind is fastened to
breath.

3\. 'Learn from me, my son, what are hunger and thirst. When a man is
thus said to be hungry, water is carrying away (digests) what has been
eaten by him. Therefore as they speak of a cow-leader (go-nâya), a
horse-leader (a*s*va-nâya), a man-leader (purusha-nâya), so they call
water (which digests food and causes hunger) food-leader (a*s*a-nâya).
Thus (by food digested &c.), my son, know this offshoot (the body) to be
brought forth, for this (body) could not be without a root (cause).

4\. 'And where could its root be except in food (earth) <span
id="fr_287"></span>[3](#fn_285)? And in the same manner, my son, as

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

food (earth) too is an offshoot, seek after its root, viz. water. And as
water too is an offshoot, seek after its root, viz. fire. And as fire
too is an offshoot, seek after its root, viz. the True. Yes, all these
creatures, my son, have their root in the True, they dwell in the True,
they rest in the True.

5\. 'When a man is thus said to be thirsty, fire carries away what has
been drunk by him. Therefore as they speak of a cow-leader (go-nâya), of
a horse-leader (a*s*va-nâya), of a man-leader (purusha-nâya), so they
call fire udanyâ, thirst, i. e. water-leader. Thus (by water digested
&c.), my son, know this offshoot (the body) to be brought forth: this
(body) could not be without a root (cause).

6\. 'And where could its root be except in water? As water is an
offshoot, seek after its root, viz. fire. As fire is an offshoot, seek
after its root, viz. the True. Yes, all these creatures, O son, have
their root in the True, they dwell in the True, they rest in the True.

'And how these three beings (devatâ), fire, water, earth, O son, when
they reach man, become each of them tripartite, has been said before
(VI, 4, 7). When a man departs from hence, his speech <span
id="fr_288"></span>[1](#fn_286) is merged

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

in his mind, his mind in his breath, his breath in heat (fire), heat in
the Highest Being.

7\. 'Now that which is that subtile essence (the root of all), in it all
that exists has its self. It is the True. It is the Self, and thou, O
*S*vetaketu, art it.'

'Please, Sir, inform me still more,' said the son.

'Be it so, my child,' the father replied.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_282"></span>[98:2](sbe01126.htm#fr_284) The deep sushupta
sleep is meant, in which personal consciousness is lost, and the self
for a time absorbed in the Highest Self. Sleep is produced by fatigue.
Speech, mind, and the senses rest, breath only remains awake, and the
*g*îva, the living soul, in order to recover from his fatigue, returns
for a while to his true Self (âtmâ). The Sat must be taken as a
substance, nay, as the highest substance or subject, the Brahman. The
whole purpose of the Upanishad is obscured if we translate sat or satyam
by truth, instead of the True, the true one,τὸ ὄντως ὄν.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[99:1](sbe01126.htm#fr_285) This is one of the
many recognised plays on words in the Upanishads and the Vedânta
philosophy. Svapiti, he sleeps, stands for sva (his own), i.e. the self,
and apîta, gone to.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[99:2](sbe01126.htm#fr_286) The commentator
takes prâ*n*a here in the sense of Sat, which it often has elsewhere. If
so, this illustration would have the same object as the preceding one.
If we took prâ*n*a in the sense of breath, breath being the result of
water, this paragraph might be taken to explain the resignation of the
living Self to its bondage to breath, while on earth.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[99:3](sbe01126.htm#fr_287) That food is the
root of the body is shown by the commentator in the following way: Food
when softened by water and digested becomes a fluid, blood (*s*onita).
From it comes flesh, from flesh fat, from fat bones, from bones marrow,
from marrow seed. Food eaten by a woman becomes equally blood (lohita),
<span id="page_100">p. 100</span> and from seed and blood combined the
new body is produced. We must always have before us the genealogical
table:--

Sat, τὸ ὄν.  
  \|  
Tegas (fire) = Vâ*k* (speech).  
  \|  
Ap (water) = Prâ*n*a (breath).  
  \|  
Anna (earth)= Manas (mind).

<span id="fn_286"></span>[100:1](sbe01126.htm#fr_288) If a man dies, the
first thing which his friends say is, He speaks no more. Then, he
understands no more. Then, he moves no more. Then, he is cold.
