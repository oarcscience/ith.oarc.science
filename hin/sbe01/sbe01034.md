### Footnotes

<span id="fn_116"></span>[22:1](sbe01034.htm#fr_117.md) The syllables here
mentioned are the so-called stobhâksharas, sounds used in the musical
recitation of the Sâman hymns, probably to fill out the intervals in the
music for which there were no words in the hymns. These syllables are
marked in the MSS. of the Sâma-veda, but their exact character and
purpose are not quite clear.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[22:2](sbe01034.htm#fr_118.md) A stobha syllable
used in the Rathantara Sâman.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[22:3](sbe01034.htm#fr_119.md) Used in the
Vâmadevya Sâman.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[22:4](sbe01034.htm#fr_120.md) The Sâman addressed
to Agni takes the syllable î as nidhana.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[22:5](sbe01034.htm#fr_121.md) The stobha
syllables used in the Sâman addressed to the Vi*s*ve Devas.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[22:6](sbe01034.htm#fr_122.md) See *Kh*. Up. I, 4,
4.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[22:7](sbe01034.htm#fr_123.md) The commentator
takes vâg as a stobha, as a syllable occurring in hymns addressed to
Virâ*g*, and as implying either the deity Virâ*g* or food.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[22:8](sbe01034.htm#fr_124.md) wealthy and
healthy.
