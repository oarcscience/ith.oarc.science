### Footnotes

teaching of Pra*g*âpati in VIII, 7, 4.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[68:1](sbe01092.htm#fr_219) It does so in the
eye, and likewise with the person in the eye, who is not affected by
anything. Cf. *Kh*. Up. IV, 14, 3.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[68:2](sbe01092.htm#fr_220) The commentator
takes light, day, &c. as persons, or devatâs. Cf. *Kh*. Up. V, 10, 1.
