## SECOND ADHYÂYA <span id="fr_527"></span>[1](#fn_525.md).

### FIRST KHA*ND*A.

1\. He (the sun), who shines, honoured this world (the body of the
worshipper, by entering into it), in the form of man <span
id="fr_528"></span>[2](#fn_526.md) (the worshipper who meditates on
breath). For he who shines (the sun) is (the same as) the breath. He
honoured this (body of the worshipper) during a hundred years, therefore
there are a hundred years in the life of a man. Because he honoured him
during a hundred years, therefore there are (the poets of the first
Ma*nd*ala of the Rig-veda, called) the Satar*k*in, (having honour for a

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

hundred years.) Therefore people call him who is really Prâ*n*a
(breath), the Satar*k*in poets <span id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_527.md).

2\. He (breath) placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists.
Because he placed himself in the midst of all whatsoever exists,
therefore there are (the poets of the second to the ninth Ma*nd*ala of
the Rig-veda, called) the Mâdhyamas. Therefore people call him who is
really Prâ*n*a (breath), the Mâdhyama poets.

3\. He as up-breathing is the swallower (g*ri*tsa), as down-breathing he
is delight (mada). Because as up-breathing he is swallower (g*ri*tsa)
and as down-breathing delight (mada), therefore there is (the poet of
the second Ma*nd*ala of the Rig-veda, called) G*ri*tsamada. Therefore
people call him who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), Gritsamada.

4\. Of him. (breath) all this whatsoever was a friend. Because of him
all (vi*s*vam) this whatsoever was a friend (mitram), therefore there is
(the poet of the third Ma*nd*ala of the Rig-veda, called) Vi*s*vâmitra.
Therefore people call him who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), Vi*s*vâmitra.

5\. The Devas (speech, &c.) said to him (the breath): 'He is to be loved
by all of us.' Because the Devas said of him, that he was to be loved
(vâma) by all of them, therefore there is (the poet of the fourth
Ma*nd*ala of the Rig-veda, called) Vâmadeva. Therefore people call him
who is really Prâ*n*a (breath), Vâmadeva.

6\. He (breath) guarded all this whatsoever from evil. Because he
guarded (atrâyata) all this whatsoever

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

from evil, therefore there are (the poets of the fifth Ma*nd*ala of the
Rig-veda, called) Atraya*h*. Therefore people call him who is really
Prâ*n*a (breath), Atraya*h*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_525"></span>[214:1](sbe01210.htm#fr_527.md) In the first
adhyâya various forms of meditating on Uktha, conceived as Prâ*n*a
(life), have been declared. In the second some other forms of
meditation, all extremely fanciful, are added. They are of interest,
however, as showing the existence of the hymns of the Rig-veda, divided
and arranged as we now possess them, at the time when this Âra*n*yaka
was composed.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[214:2](sbe01210.htm#fr_528.md) The identity of
the sun and of breath as living in man has been established before. It
is the same power in both, conceived either adhidaivatam (mythological)
or adhyâtmam (physiological).

<span id="fn_527"></span>[215:1](sbe01210.htm#fr_529.md) The real ground
for the name is that the poets of the first Ma*nd*ala composed on an
average each about a hundred *Rik*, verses.
