</p>  <h2 align="center">III, 7. Charm against kshetriya, hereditary disease.</h2>  
<p>1. Upon the head of the nimble antelope a remedy grows! He has driven the kshetriya (inherited disease) in all directions by means of the horn.<br> 2. The antelope has gone after thee with his four feet. O horn, loosen the kshetriya that is knitted into his heart!<br> 3. (The horn) that glistens yonder like a roof with four wings (sides), with that do we drive out every kshetriya from thy limbs.<br> 4. The lovely twin stars, the vikritau ('the two looseners') that are yonder upon the sky, shall loosen the nethermost and the uppermost fetter of the kshetriya!<br> 5. The waters, verily, are healers, the waters are scatterers of disease, the waters cure all disease: may they. relieve thee from the kshetriya!<br> 6. The kshetriya that has entered into thee from the prepared (magic) concoction, for that I know the remedy; I drive the kshetriya out of thee.<br> 7. When the constellations fade away, and when the dawn does fade away, (then) shall he shine away from us every evil and the kshetriya!</p>
