## IV, 6. Charm against demons (pisâka) conceived as the cause of disease.

1\. May Agni Vaisvânara, the bull of unfailing strength, burn up him
that is evil-disposed, and desires to harm us, and him that plans
hostile deeds against us!  
2. Between the two rows of teeth of Agni Vaisvânara do I place him that
plans to injure us, when we are not planning to injure him; and him that
plans to injure us, when we do plan to injure him.  
Those who hound us in our chambers, while shouting goes on in the night
of the new moon, and the other flesh-devourers who plan to injure us,
all of them do I overcome with might.  
4. With might I overcome the Pisâkas, rob them of their property; all
evil-disposed (demons) do I slay: may my device succeed!  
5. With the gods who vie with, and measure their swiftness with this
sun, with those that are in the rivers, and in the mountains, do I,
along with my cattle, consort.  
6. I plague the Pisâkas as the tiger the cattle-owners. As dogs who have
seen a lion, these do not find a refuge.  
7. My strength does not lie with Pisâkas, nor with thieves, nor with
prowlers in the forest. From the village which I enter the Pisâkas
vanish away.  
8. From the village which my fierce power has entered the Pisâkas vanish
away; they do not devise evil.  
9. They who irritate me with their jabber, as (buzzing) mosquitoes the
elephant, them I regard as wretched (creatures), as small vermin upon
people.  
10. May Nirriti (the goddess of destruction) take hold of this one, as a
horse with the halter! The fool who is wroth with me is not freed from
(her) snare.
