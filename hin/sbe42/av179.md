## VII, 50. Prayer for success at dice.

1\. As the lightning at all times smites irresistibly the tree, thus
would I to-day irresistibly beat the gamesters with my dice!  
2. Whether they be alert, or not alert, the fortune of (these) folks,
unresisting, shall assemble from all sides, the gain (collect) within my
hands!  
3. I invoke with reverence Agni, who has his own riches; here attached
he shall beap up gain for us! I procure (wealth) for myself, as if with
chariots that win the race. May I accomplish auspiciously the song of
praise to the Maruts!  
4. May we by thy aid conquer the (adversary s) troop; help us (to
obtain) our share in every contest! Make for us, O Indra, a good and
ample road; crush, O Maghavan, the lusty power of our enemies!  
5. I have conquered and cleaned thee out (?); I have also gained thy
reserve. As the wolf plucks to pieces the sheep, thus do I pluck thy
winnings.  
6. Even the strong hand the bold player conquers, as the skilled gambler
heaps up his winnings at the proper time. Upon him that loves the game
(the god), and does not spare his money, (the game, the god) verily
bestows the delights of wealth.  
7. Through (the possession of) cattle we all would suppress (our)
wretched poverty, or with grain our hunger, O thou oft implored (god)!
May we foremost among rulers, unharmed, gain wealth by our cunning
devices!  
8. Gain is deposited in my right hand, victory in my left. Let me become
a conqueror of cattle, horses, wealth, and gold!  
9. O dice, yield play, profitable as a cow that is rich in milk! Bind me
to a streak of gain, as the bow (is bound) with the string!
