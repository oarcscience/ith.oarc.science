</p>  <h2 align="center">XIX, 39. Prayer to the kushtha-plant to destroy takman (fever), and other ailments.</h2>  
<p>1. May the protecting god kushtha come hither from the Himavant: destroy thou every takman, and all female spooks!<br> 2. Three names hast thou, O kushtha, (namely: kushtha), na-gh&acirc;-m&acirc;ra ('forsooth-no-death'), and na-gh&acirc;-risha ('forsooth-no-harm'). Verily no harm shall suffer (na gh&acirc; . . . rishat) this person here, for whom I bespeak thee morn and eve, aye the (entire) day!<br> 3. Thy mother's name is g&icirc;val&acirc; ('quickening'), thy father's name is g&icirc;vanta ('living'). Verily no harm shall suffer this person here, for whom I bespeak thee morn and eve, aye the entire day!<br> 4. Thou art the most superior of the plants, as a steer among cattle, as the tiger among beasts of prey. Verily no harm shall stiffer this person here, for whom I bespeak thee morn and eve, aye the entire day!<br> 5. Thrice begotten by the S&acirc;mbu Angiras, thrice by the &Acirc;dityas, and thrice by all the gods, this kushtha, a universal remedy, stands together with soma. Destroy thou every takman, and all female spooks!<br> 6. The asvattha-tree is the seat of the gods in the third heaven from here. There came to sight the amrita (ambrosia), there the kushtha-plant was born.<br> 7. A golden ship with golden tackle moved upon the heavens. There came to sight the amrita, there the kushtha-plant was born.<br> 8. On the spot where the ship glided down, on the peak of the Himavant, there came to sight the ambrosia, there the kushtha-plant was born. This kushtha, a universal remedy, stands together with soma. Destroy thou every takman, and all female spooks!<br> 9. (We know) thee whom Ikshv&acirc;ku knew of yore, whom the women, fond of kushtha, knew, whom V&acirc;yasa and M&acirc;tsya knew: therefore art thou a universal remedy.<br> 10. The takman that returns on each third day, the one that cominues without intermission, and the yearly one, ao thou, (O plant) of unremitting strength, drive away down below!</p>
