1\. O Bhava and Sarva, I am devoted to you. Take note of that, ye under
whose control, is all this which shines (the visible universe)! Ye who
rule all these two-footed and four-footed creatures, deliver us from
calamity!  
2. Ye to whom belongs all that is near by, yea, all that is far; ye who
are known as the most skilful archers among bowmen; ye who rule all
these two-footed and four-footed creatures, deliver us from calamity!  
3. The thousand-eyed slayers of Vritra both do I invoke. I go praising
the two strong gods (ugrau) whose pastures extend far. Ye who rule all
these two-footed and four-footed creatures, deliver us from calamity!  
4. Ye who, united, did undertake many (deeds) of old, and, moreover, did
visit portents upon the. people; ye who rule all these two-footed and
fourfooted creatures, deliver us from calamity!  
5. Ye from whose blows no one either among gods or men escapes; ye who
rule all these twofooted and four-footed creatures, deliver us from
calamity!  
6. The sorcerer who prepares a spell, or manipulates the roots (of
plants) against us, against him, ye strong gods, launch your
thunderbolt! Ye who rule all these two-footed and four-footed creatures,
deliver us from calamity.  
7. Ye strong gods, favour us in battles, bring into contact with your
thunderbolt the Kimîdin! I praise you, O Bhava and Sarva, call fervently
upon you in distress: deliver us from calamity!
