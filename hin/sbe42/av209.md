## XIII, 1. Prayer for sovereign power addressed to the god Rohita and his female Rohinî.

1\. Rise up, O steed, that art within the waters, enter this kingdom,
rich in liberal gifts! Rohita (the red sun) who has begotten this all,
shall keep thee well-supported for sovereignty!  
2. The steed that is within the waters has risen up: ascend upon the
clans that are sprung from thee! Furnishing soma, the waters, plants,
and cows, cause thou four-footed and two-footed creatures to enter
here!  
3. Do ye, strong Maruts, children of Prisni (the cloud), allied with
Indra, crush the enemies! Rohita shall hear you, that give abundant
gifts, the thrice seven Maruts, who take delight in sweet
(nourishment)!  
4. Rohita has climbed the heights, he has ascended them, he, the embryo
of women, (has ascended) the womb of births. Closely united with these
women they found out the six broad (directions); spying out a road he
has brought hither sovereignty.  
5. Hither to thee Rohita has brought sovereignty; he has dispersed the
enemies: freedom from danger has resulted for thee. To thee heaven and
earth together with the revatî and sakvarî-stanzas shall yield gifts at
will!  
6. Rohita produced heaven and earth; there Parameshthin (the lord on
high) extended the thread (of the sacrifice). There Aga Ekapâda (the
one-footed goat, the sun) did fix himself; he made firm the heavens and
earth with his strength.  
7. Rohita made firm heaven and earth, by him the (heavenly) light was
established, by him the firmament. By him the atmosphere and the spaces
were measured out, through him the gods obtained immortality.  
8. Rohita did ponder the multiform (universe) while preparing (his)
climbings and advances. Having ascended the heaven with great might, he
shall anoint thy royalty with milk and ghee!  
9. All thy climbings, advances, and all thy ascents with which thou,
(Rohita, the sun), fillest the heavens and the atmosphere, having
strengthened thyself with their brahma and payas (spiritual and physical
essence) do thou keep awake (do thou watch over) among the people in the
kingdom of the (earthly) Rohita (the king)!  
10. The peoples that have originated from thy tapas (heat, or creative
fervour), have followed here the calf, the gâyatri. They shall enter
thee with kindly spirit; the calf Rohita with its mother shall come
on!  
11. High on the firmament Rohita has stood, a youth, a sage, begettinu
all forms. As Agni he shines with piercing light, in the third space he
did assume lovely (forms).  
12. A bull with a thousand horns, Gâtavedas (fire), endowed with
sacrifices of ghee, carrying soma upon his back, rich in heroes, he
shall, when implored, not abandon me, nor may I abandon thee: abundance
in cattle and abundance in heroes procure for me!  
14. Rohita is the generator of the sacrifice, and its mouth; to Rohita I
offer oblations with voice, ear, and mind. To Rohita the gods resort
with glad mind: he shall cause me to rise through elevation derived from
the assembly!  
14. Rohita arranged a sacrifice for Visvakarman; from it these
brilliant, qualities have come to me. Let me announce thy origin over
the extent of the world!  
15, Upon thee have ascended the brihatî and the pankti (metres), upon
thee the kakubh with splendour, O Gâtavedas. Upon thee the vashat-call,
whose syllables make an ushnihâ, has ascended, upon thee Rohita with his
seed has ascended.  
16. This one clothes himself in the womb of the earth, this one clothes
himself in heaven, and in the atmosphere. This one at the station of the
brown (sun) did attain unto the worlds of light.  
17. O Vâkaspati (lord of speech), the earth shall be pleasant to us,
pleasant our dwelling, agrecable our couches! Right here life's breath
shall be to our friend; thee, O Parameshthin, Agni shall envelop in life
and lustre!  
18. O Vâkaspati, the five seasons that we have, which have come about as
the creation of Visvakarman, rialit here (they and) life's breath shall
be to our friend; thee, O Parameshthin, Rohita shall envelop in life and
lustre!  
19. O Vâkaspati, good cheer and spirit, cattle in our stable, children
in our wombs beget thou! Right here life's breath shall be to our
friend; thee, O Parameshthin, I envelop in life and lustre.  
20. God Savitar and Agni shall envelop thee, Mitra and Varuna surround
thee with lustre! Treading down all powers of grudge come thou hither:
thou hast made this kingdom rich in liberal gifts.  
21. Thou, O Rohita, whom the brindled cow, harnessed at the side,
carries, goest with brilliance, causing the waters to flow.  
22. Devoted to Rohita is Rohinî his mistress, with beautiful colour
(complexion), great, and lustrous: through her may we conquer booty of
every description, through her win every battle!  
23. This seat, Rohinî, belongs to Rohita; yonder is the path on which
the brindled (female) goes! Her the Gandharvas and the Kasyapas lead
forth, her the sages guard with diligence.  
24. The radiant bay steeds of the sun, the immortal, ever draw the
delightful chariot. Rohita, the drinker of ghee, the shining god, did
enter the variegated heavens.  
25. Rohita, the sharp-horned bull, who surpasses Agni and surpasses
Sûrya, who props up the earth and the sky, out of him the gods frame the
creations.  
26. Rohita ascended the heaven from the great flood; Rohita has climbed
all heights.  
27. Create (the cow) that is rich in milk, drips with ghee: she is the
milch-cowof the gods that does not refuse! Indra shall drink the Soma,
there shall be secure possession; Agni shall sing praises: the enemies
do thou drive out!  
28. Agni kindled, spreads his flames, fortified by ghee, sprinkled with
ghee. Victorious, all-conquering Agni shall slay them that are my
rivals!  
29. He shall slay them, shall burn the enemy that battles against us!
With the flesh-devouring Agni do we burn our rivals.  
30. Smite them down, O Indra, with the thunderbolt, with thy (strong)
arm! Then have I overpowered my rivals with Agni's brilliant
strengths.  
31. O Agni, subject our rivals to us; confuse, O Brihaspati, the kinsman
that is puffed up! O Indra and Agni, O Mitra and Varuna, subjected they
shall be, unable to vent their wrath against us!  
32. Do thou, god Sûrya (the sun), when thou risest, beat down my rivals,
beat them down with a stone: they shall go to the nethermost darkness!  
33. The calf of Virâg, the bull of prayers, carrying the bright (soma)
upon his back, has ascended the atmosphere. A song accompanied by ghee
they sing to the calf; himself brahma (spiritual exaltation) they swell
him with their brahma (prayer).  
34. Ascend the heavens, ascend the earth sovereignty ascend thou, and
possessions ascend thou! Offspring ascend thou, and immortality ascend
thou, unite thy body with Rohita!  
35. The gods that hold sovereignty, who go about the sun, with these
allied, Rohita, kindly disposed, shall bestow sovereignty upon thee!  
36. The sacrifices purified by prayer lead thee forth; the bay steeds
that travel upon the road carry thee: thou shinest across the swelling
ocean.  
37. In Rohita who conquers wealth, conquers cattle, and conquers booty,
heaven and earth are fixed. Of thee that hast a thousand and seven
births, let me announce the origin over the extent of the world!  
38. Glorious thou goest to the intermediate directions and the
directions (of space), glorious (in the sight) of animals and the tribes
of men, glorious in the lap of the earth, of Aditi: may I like Savitar
be lovely!  
39. Being yonder thou knowest (what takes place) here; being here thou
beholdest these things. Here (men) behold the inspired sun that shines
upon the sky.  
40. A god thou praisest the gods, thou movest within the flood. They
kindle (him), a universal fire; him the highest sages know.  
41. Below the superior (region), above the inferior (region) here, the
cow has arisen supporting (her) calf by the foot. Whither is she turned;
to which half (of the universe), forsooth, has she aone away; where,
forsooth, does she beget? Verily not in this herd!  
42. One-footed, two-footed, four-footed is she; eight-footed,
nine-footed became she, the thousand-syllabled (consisting of thousand
elements) pankti (quinary stanza) of the universe: the oceans from her
flow forth upon (the world).  
43. Ascending the heaven, immortal, receive kindly my song! The
sacrifices purified by prayer lead thee forth; the bay steeds that
travel upon the road carry thee.  
44. That do I know of thee, O immortal, where thy march is upon the sky,
where thy habitation is in the highest heaven.  
45. Sûrya (the sun) surveys the sky, Sûrya the earth, Sûrya the waters.
Sûrya is the single eye of being: he has ascended the great heavens.  
46. The broad (directions) where the fagots that fence in (the fire),
the earth turned itself into a fire-altar. There Rohita laid on for
himself these two fires, cold and heat.  
47. Laying on cold and heat, using the mountains as sacrificial posts,
the two fires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly) light, into which (the
fires) rain (flowed) as ghee, carried out the sacrifice.  
48. The fire of Rohita who knows the (heavenly) light is kindled by
prayer. From it heat, from it cold, from it the sacrifice was
produced.  
49. The two fires swelling through prayer, increased through prayer,
sacrificed into with prayer; the two fires of Rohita who knows the
(heavenly) light, kindled through prayer, carried out the sacrifice.  
50. One is deposited in truth, the other is kindled in the waters. The
two fires of Rohita who knows the (heavenly) light, kindled through
prayer, carried out the sacrifice.  
51. The fire which the wind brightens up, and that which Indra and
Brahmanaspati (brighten up), the two fires of Rohita who knows the
(heavenly) light, kindled through prayer, carried out the sacrifice.  
52. Having fashioned the earth into an altar, having made the heavens
(his) sacrificial reward, then having made heat into fire, Rohita
created all that has breath through rain (serving) as ghee.  
53. Rain fashioned itself into ghee, heat into fire, the earth into an
altar. Then Agni by (his) songs fashioned the high mountains.  
54. Having fashioned by means of songs the high (mountains), Rohita
spake to the earth: In thee all shall be born, what is and what shall
be.  
55. The sacrifice first, (and then) what is and what shall be was born.
From that this all was born, and whatever here appears, brought hither
by the sage Rohita.  
56. He who kicks a cow with his foot, and he who micturates towards the
sun--of thee do I tear out the root; thou shalt henceforth not cast a
shadow!  
57. Thou that passest across me, casting thy shadow against me, between
me and the fire--of thee do I tear out the root; thou shalt henceforth
not cast a shadow!  
58. He, O god Sûrya, that to-day passes between thee and me, upon him
our evil dream, our foulness, and our misfortunes do we wipe off.  
59. May we not miss our way, may we not, O Indra, miss the sacrifice of
him that presses the soma; may.not the powers of grudge intercept us!  
60. The (guiding) thread stretched out among the gods, that accomplishes
the sacrifice, that, by pouring oblations, may we attain!
