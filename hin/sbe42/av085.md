## IV, 18. Charm with the apâmârga-plant, against sorcerers and demons.

1\. Night is like unto the sun, the (starry) night is similar to day.
The truth do I engage for help: the enchantments shall be devoid of
force!  
2. He, O ye gods, who prepares a spell, and carries it to the house of
one that knows not (of it), upon him the spell, returning, shall fasten
itself like a suckling calf upon its mother!  
3. The person that prepares evil at home, and desires with it to harm
another, she is consumed by fire, and many stones fall upon her with a
loud crash.  
4. Bestow curses, O thou (apâmârga), that hast a thousand homes, upon
the (demons) visikha ('crestless'), and vigrîva ('crooked-neck')! Turn
back the spell upon him that has performed it, as a beloved maid (is
brought) to her lover!  
5. With this plant I have put to naught all spells, those that they have
put into thy field, thy cattle, and into thy domestics.  
6. He that has undertaken them has not been able to accomplish them: he
broke his foot, his toe. He performed a lucky act for us, but for
himself an injury.  
7. The apâmârga-plant shall wipe out (apa mârshtu) 'inherited ills, and
curses; yea, it shall wipe out all witches, and all grudging demons
(arâyî)!  
8. Having wiped out all sorcerers, and all grudging demons, with thee, O
apâmârga, we wipe all that (evil) out.
