## VI, 113. Expiation for certain heinous crimes.

1\. On Trita the gods wiped off this sin, Trita wiped it off on human
beings; hence if Grâhi (attack of disease) has seized thee, may these
gods remove her by means of their charm!  
2. Enter into the rays, into smoke, O sin; go into the vapours, and into
the fog! Lose thyself on the foam of the river! 'Wipet off, O Pûshan,
the misdeeds upon him that practiseth abortion!  
3. Deposited in twelve places is that which has been wiped off Trita,
the sins belonging to humanity. Hence if Grâhi has seized thee, may
these gods remove her by means of their charm!
