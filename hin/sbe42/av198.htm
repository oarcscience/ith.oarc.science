</p>  <h2 align="center">VII, 115. Charm for the removal of evil characteristics, and the acquisition of auspicious ones.</h2>  
<p>1. Fly forth from here, O evil mark, vanish from here, fly forth to yonder place! Upon him that hates us do we fasten thee with a brazen hook.<br> 2. The unsavoury mark which flying has alighted upon me, as a creeper upon a tree, that mayest thou put away from us, away from here, O golden-handed<br> (golden-rayed) Savitar (the sun), bestowing goods upon us!<br> 3. Together with the body of the mortal, from his birth, one and a hundred marks are born. Those that are most foul do we drive away from here; the auspicious ones, O G&acirc;tavedas (Agni), do thou hold fast for us!<br> 4. These (marks) here I have separated, as cows scattered upon the heather. The pure marks shall remain, the foul ones I have made to disappear!</p>
