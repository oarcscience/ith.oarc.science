## VII, 139. Charm to arouse the passionate love of a woman.

1\. Clinging to the ground thou didst grow, (O plant), that producest
bliss for me; a hundred branches extend from thee, three and thirty grow
down from thee: with this plant of a thousand leaves thy heart do I
parch.  
2. Thy heart shall parch (with love) for me, and thy mouth shall parch
(with love for me)! Languish, moreover, with love for me, with parched
mouth pass thy days!  
3. Thou that causest affection, kindlest (love), brown, lovely (plant),
draw (us) together; draw together yonder woman and myself, our hearts
make the same!  
4. As the mouth of him that hath not drunk dries tip, thus languish thou
with love for me, with parched mouth pass thy days!  
5. As the Ichneumon tears the serpent, and joins him together again,
thus, O potent (plant), join together what hath been torn by love!
