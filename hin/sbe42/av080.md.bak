## VI, 2. The soma-oblation directed against Demons (rakshas).

1\. Press the soma, ye priests, and rinse it (for renewed pressing), in
behalf of Indra who shall listen to the song of the worshipper, and to
my call!  
2. Do thou, O doughty (Indra), whom the drops of soma enter as birds a
tree, beat off the hostile brood of the Rakshas!  
3. Press ye the soma for Indra, the soma-drinker, who wields the
thunderbolt! A youthful victor and ruler is he, praised by many men.
