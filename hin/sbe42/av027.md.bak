## VII, 76. A. Charm for curing scrofulous sores called apakit.

1\. Ye (sores) fall easily from that which falls easily, ye exist less
than those that do not exist (at all); ye are drier than the (part of
the body called) sehu, more moist than salt.  
2. The apakit (sores) that are upon the neck, and those that are upon
the shoulders; the apakit that are upon the vigâman (some part of the
body) fall off of themselves.

### B. Charm for curing tumours called gâyânya.

3\. The gâyânya that crushes the ribs, that which passes down to the
sole of the foot, and whichever is fixed upon the crown of the head, I
have driven out every one.  
4. The gâyânya, winged, flies; he settles down upon man. Here is the
remedy both for sores not caused by cutting as well as for wounds
sharply cut!  
5. We know, O gâyânya, thy origin, whence thou didst spring. How canst
thou slay there, in whose house we offer oblations?

### C. Stanza sung at the mid-day pressure of the soma.

6\. Drink stoutly, O Indra, slayer of Vritra, hero, of the soma in the
cup, at the battle for riches! Drink thy fill at the mid-day pressure!
Living in wealth, do thou bestow wealth upon us!
