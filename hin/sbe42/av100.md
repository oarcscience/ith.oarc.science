## VII 37. Curse against one that practises hostile charms.

1\. The thousand-eyed curse having yoked his chariot has come hither,
seeking out him that curses me, as a wolf the house of him that owns
sheep.  
2. Avoid us, O curse, as a burning fire (avoids) a lake! Strike here him
that curses us, as the lightning of heaven the tree!  
3. He that shall curse us when we do not curse, and he that shall curse
us when we do curse, him do I hurl to death as a bone to a dog upon the
ground.
