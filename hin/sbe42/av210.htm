</p>  <h2 align="center">XI, 5. Glorification of the sun, or the primeval principle, as a Brahman disciple.</h2>  
<p>1. The Brahmak&acirc;rin (Brahmanical disciple) moves inciting both hemispheres of the world; in him the gods are harmonised. He holds the heavens and the earth, he fills the teacher with creative fervour (tapas).<br> 2. The fathers, the divine folk, and all the gods severally follow the Brahmak&acirc;rin; the Gandharvas did go after him, six thousand three hundred and thirty-three. He fills all the gods with creative fervour.<br> 3. When the teacher receives the Brahmak&acirc;rin as a disciple, he places him as a foetus inside (of his body). He carries him for three nights in his belly: when he is born the gods gather about to see him.<br> 4. This earth is (his first) piece of firewood, the heaven the second, and the atmosphere also he fills with (the third) piece of firewood. The Brahmak&acirc;rin. fills the worlds with his firewood, his girdle, his asceticism, and his creative fervour.<br> 5. Prior to the brahma (spiritual exaltation) the Brahmak&acirc;rin was born; clothed in heat, by creative fervour he arose. From him sprung the br&acirc;hmanam (Brahmanic life) and the highest brahma, and all the gods together with immortality (amrita).<br> 6. The Brahmak&acirc;rin advances, kindled by the firewood, clothed in the skin of the black antelope, consecrated, with long beard. Within the day he passes from the eastern to the northern sea; gathering together the worlds he repeatedly shapes them.<br> 7. The Brahmak&acirc;rin, begetting the brahma, the waters, the world, Prag&acirc;pati Parameshthin (he that stands in the hiahest place), and Vir&acirc;g, having become an embryo in the womb of immortality, having forsooth, become Indra, pierced the Asuras.<br> 8. The teacher fashioned these two hern spheres of the world, the broad and the deep, earth and heaven. These the Brahmak&acirc;rin guards with his creative fervour (tapas): in him the gods are harmonised.<br> 9. This broad earth and the heaven the Brahmak&acirc;rin first brought hither as alms. Having made these into two sticks of firewood he reveres them upon them all beings have been founded.<br> 10. One is on the hither side, the other on the farther side of the back of the heavens; secretly are deposited the two receptacles of the br&acirc;hmanam (Brahmanic life). These the Brahmak&acirc;rin protects by his tapas (creative fervour); understandingly he performs that brahma (spiritual exaltation) solely.<br> 11. One on the hither side, the other away from the earth, do the two Agnis come together between these two hemispheres (of the world). To them adhere the rays firmly; the Brahmak&acirc;rin by his tapas (creative fervour) enters into the (rays).<br> 12. Shouting forth, thundering, red, white he carries a great penis along the earth. The Brahmak&acirc;rin sprinkles seed upon the back of the earth; through it the four directions live.<br> 13. Into fire, the sun, the moon, M&acirc;tarisvan (wind), and the waters, the Brahmak&acirc;rin places the firewood; the lights from these severally go into the clouds, from them come sacrificial butter, the purusha (primeval man), rain, and water.<br> 14. Death is the teacher, (and) Varuna, Soma, the plants, milk; the clouds were the warriors: by these this light has been brought hither.<br> 15. Varuna, having become the teacher, at home prepares the ghee solely. Whatever he desired from Prag&acirc;pati, that the Brahmak&acirc;rin furnished, as Mitra (a friend) from his own Atman (spirit, or person).<br> 16. The Brahmak&acirc;rin is the teacher, the Brahmak&acirc;rin Prag&acirc;pati. Prag&acirc;pati rules (shines forth, vi r&acirc;gati); Vir&acirc;g (heavenly power, or light) became Indra, the ruler.<br> 17. Through holy disciplehood. (brahmak&acirc;ryam), through tapas (creative fervour), the king protects his kingdom. The teacher by (his own) brahmak&acirc;ryam (holy life) seeks (finds) the Brahmak&acirc;rin.<br> 18. Through holy disciplehood the maiden obtains a young husband, through holy disciplehood the steer, the horse seeks to obtain fodder.<br> 19. Through holy disciplehood, through creative fervour, the gods drove away death. Indrajorsooth, by his holy disciplehood brought the light to the gods.<br> 20. The plants, that which was and shall be, day and night, the tree, the year along with the seasons, have sprung from the Brahmak&acirc;rin.<br> 21. The earthly and the heavenly animals, the wild and the domestic, the wingless and the winged (animals), have sprung from the Brahmak&acirc;rin.<br> 22. All the creatures of Prag&acirc;pati (the creator) severally carry breath in their souls. All these the brahma, which has been brought hither in the Brahmak&acirc;rin, protects.<br> 23. This, that was set into motion by the gods, that is insurmountable, that moves shining, from it has sprung the br&acirc;hmanam (Brahmanical life), the highest brahma, and all the gods, together with immortality (amrita).<br> 24, 25. The Brahmak&acirc;rin carries the shining brahma: into this all the gods are woven. Producing in-breathing and out-breathing, as well as through-breathing; speech, mind, heart, brahma, and wisdom, do thou furnish us with sight, hearing, glory, food, semen, blood, and belly!<br> 26. These things the Brahmak&acirc;rin fashioned upon the back of the (heavenly) water. He stood in the sea kindled with tapas (creative fervour). He, when he has bathed, shines vigorously upon the earth, brown and ruddy.</p>
