## VI, 14. Charm against the disease balâsa.

1\. The internal disease that has set in, that crumbles the bones, and
crumbles the joints, every balâsa do thou drive out, that which is in
the limbs, and in the joints!  
2. The balâsa of him that is afflicted with balâsa do I remove, as one
gelds a lusty animal. Its connection do I cut off as the root of a
pumpkin.  
3. Fly forth from here, O balâsa, as a swift foal (after the mare). And
even, as the reed in every year, pass away without slaying men!
