</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 14. Charm against the disease bal&acirc;sa.</h2>  
<p>1. The internal disease that has set in, that crumbles the bones, and crumbles the joints, every bal&acirc;sa do thou drive out, that which is in the limbs, and in the joints!<br> 2. The bal&acirc;sa of him that is afflicted with bal&acirc;sa do I remove, as one gelds a lusty animal. Its connection do I cut off as the root of a pumpkin.<br> 3. Fly forth from here, O bal&acirc;sa, as a swift foal (after the mare). And even, as the reed in every year, pass away without slaying men!</p>
