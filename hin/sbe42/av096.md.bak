## VII, 70. Frustration of the sacrifice of an enemy.

1\. Whenever yonder person in his thought, and with his speech, offers
sacrifice accompanied by oblations and benedictions, may Nirriti (the
goddess of destruction), allying herself with death, smite his offering
before it takes effect!  
2. May sorcerers, Nirriti, as well as Rakshas, mar his true work with
error! May the gods, despatched by Indra, scatter (churn) his
sacrificial butter; may that which yonder person offers not succeed!  
3. The two agile supreme rulers, like two eagle-s pouiicing down, shall
strike the sacrificial butter pf the enemy, whosoever plans evil against
us!  
4. Back do I tie both thy two arms, thy mouth I shut. With the fury of
god Agni, have I destroyed thy oblation.  
5. I tie thy two arms, I shut thy mouth. With the fury of terrible Agni
have I destroyed thy oblation.
