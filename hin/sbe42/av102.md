# CHARMS PERTAINING TO WOMEN (STRIKARATÂNI).

## II, 36. Charm to obtain a husband.

1\. May, O Agni, a suitor after our own heart come to us, may he come to
this maiden with our fortune! May she, agreeable to suitors, charming at
festivals, promptly obtain happiness through a husband!  
2. Agreeable to Soma, agreeable to Brahma, arranged by Aryaman, with the
unfailing certainty of god Dhâtar, do I bestow upon thee good fortune,
the acquisition of a husband.  
3. This woman shall obtain a hnsband, since king Soma makes her lovely!
May she, begetting sons, become a queen; may she, going to her husband,
shine in loveliness!  
4. As this comfortable cave, O Maghavan (Indra), furnishing a safe
abode, hath become pleasing to animals, thus may this woman be a
favourite of fortune (Bhaga), beloved, not at odds with her husband!  
5. Do thou ascend the full, inexhaustible ship of Bhaga (fortune); upon
this bring, hither the suitor who shall be agreeable (to thee)!  
6. Bring hither by thy shouts, O lord of wealth, the suitor, bend his
mind towards her; turn thou the right side of every agreeable suitor
towards (her)!  
7. This gold and bdellium, this balsam, and Bhaga (fortune), too; these
have prepared thee for husbands, that thou mayest obtain the one that is
agreeable.  
8. Hither to thee Savitar shall lead the husband that is agreeable! Do
thou, O herb, bestow (him) upon her!
