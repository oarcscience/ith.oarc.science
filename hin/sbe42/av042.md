## VI, 12. Charm against snake-poison.

1\. As the sun (goes around) the heavens I have surrounded the race of
the serpents. As night (puts to rest) all animals except the hamsa bird,
(thus) do I with this (charm) ward off thy poison.  
2. With (the charm) that was found of yore by the Brahmans, found by the
Rishis, and found by the gods, with (the charm) that was, will be, and
is now present, with this do I ward off thy poison.  
3. With honey do I mix the rivers; the mountains and peaks are honey.
Honey are the rivers Parushnî and Sîpalâ. Prosperity be to thy mouth,
prosperity to thy heart!
