## VI, 112. Expiation for the precedence of a younger brother over an older.

1\. May this (younger brother) not slay the oldest one of them, O Agni;
protect him that he be not torn out by the root! Do thou here cunningly
loosen the fetter of Grâhi (attack of disease); may all the gods give
thee leave!  
2. Free these three, O Agni, from the three fetters with which they have
been shackled! Do thou cunningly loosen the fetters of Grâhi; release
them all, father, sons, and mother!  
3. The fetters with which the older brother, whose younger brother has
married before him, has been bound, with which he has been encumbered
and shackled limb by limb, may they be loosened; since fit for loosening
they are! Wipe off, O Pûshan, the misdeeds upon him that practiseth
abortion!
