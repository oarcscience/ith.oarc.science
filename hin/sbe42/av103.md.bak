## VI, 60. Charm for obtaining a husband.

1\. This Aryaman (wooer) with loosened crest of hair comes hither in
front (of the procession), seeking a husband for this spinster, and a
wife for this wifeless man.  
2. This maid, O Aryaman, has wearied of going to the wedding-feasts of
other women. Now shall, without fail, O Aryaman, other women go to her
wedding-feast!  
3. Dhâtar (the creator) supports (didhhra) this earth, Dhâtar supports
the heavens, and the sun. May Dhatar furnish this spinster with a
husband after her own heart).
