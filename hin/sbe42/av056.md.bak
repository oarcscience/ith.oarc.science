## XIX, 34, Charm with an amulet derived from the gafigpida-tree, aoainst diseases and demons.

1\. Thou art an Angiras, O gangida, a protector art thou, O gangida. All
two-footed and four-footed creatures that belong to us the gangida shall
protect!  
2. The sorceries fifty-three in number, and the hundred performers of
sorcery, all these having lost their force, the gangida shall render
bereft of strength!  
3. Bereft of strength is the gotten-up clamour, bereft of strength are
the seven debilitating (charms). Do thou, O gangida, hurl away from here
poverty, as an archer an arrow!  
4. This gangida is a destroyer of witchcraft, and also a destroyer of
hostile powers. May then the powerful gangida extend far our lives!  
5. May the greatness of the gangida protect us about on all sides, (the
greatness) with which he has overcome the vishkandha (and) the
samskandha, (overcoming the powerful (disease) with power!  
6. Thrice the gods begot thee that hast grown up upon the earth. The
Brahmanas of yore knew thee here by the name of Angiras.  
7. Neither the plants of olden times, nor they of recent times, surpass
thee; a fierce slayer is the gahaida, and a happy refuge.  
8 And when, O gangida of boundless virtue, thou didst spring up in the
days of yore, O fierce (plant), Indra at first placed strength in
thee.  
9. Fierce Indra, verily, put might into thee, O lord of the forest!
Dispersing all diseases, slay thou the Rakshas, O plant!  
I o. The breaking disease and the tearing disease, the balâsa, and the
pain in the limbs, the takman that comes every autumn, may the gangida
render devoid of force!
