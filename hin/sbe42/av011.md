## VI, 105. Charm against cough.

1\. As the-soul with the soul's desires swiftly to a distance flies,
thus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the soul's course of flight!  
2. As a well-sharpened arrow swiftly to a distance flies, thus do thou,
O cough, fly forth along the expanse of the earth!  
3. As the rays of the sun swiftly to a distance fly, thus do thou, O
cough, fly forth along the flood of the sea!
