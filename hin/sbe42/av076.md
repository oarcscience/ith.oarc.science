## XIX, 26. Gold as an amulet for long life.

1\. The gold which is born from fire, the immortal, they bestowed upon
the mortals. He who knows this deserves it; of old age dies he who wears
it.  
2. The gold, (endowed by) the sun with beautiful colour, which the men
of yore, rich in descendants, did desire, may it gleaming envelop thee
in lustre! Long-lived becomes he who wears it!  
3. (May it envelop) thee unto (long) life, unto lustre, unto force, and
unto strength, that thou shalt by the brilliancy of the gold shine forth
among people!  
4. (The gold) which king Varuna knows, which god Brihaspati knows, which
Indra, the slayer of Vritra, knows, may that become for thee a source of
life, may that become for thee a source of lustre!
