# VII.

# CHARMS TO SECURE PROSPERITY IN HOUSE, FIELD, CATTLE, BUSINESS, GAMBLING, AND KINDRED MATTERS.

## III, 12. Prayer at the building of a house.

1\. Right here do I erect a firm house: may it stand upon a (good)
foundation, dripping with ghee! Thee may we inhabit, O house, with
heroes all, with strong heroes, with uninjured heroes!  
2. Right here, do thou, O house, stand firmly, full of horses, full of
cattle, full of abundance! Full of sap, ful.\] of ghee, full of milk,
elevate thyself unto great happiness!  
3. A supporter art thou, O house, with broad roof, containing purified
grain! To thee may the calf come, to thee the child, to thee the
milch-cows, when they return in the evening!  
4. May Savitar, Vâyu, Indra, Brihaspati cunningly erect this house! Alay
the Alaruts sprinkle it with moisture and with ghee; may king Bhaga let
our ploughing take root!  
5. O mistress of dwelling, as a sheltering and kindly goddess thou wast
erected by the gods in the bealrinina; clothed in grass, be thou kindly
disposed; give us, moreover, wealth along with heroes!  
6. Do thou, O cross-beam, according to regulation ascend the post, do
thou, mightily ruling, hold off the enemies! May they that approach thee
reverently, O house, not suffer injury, may we with all our heroes live
a hundred autumns!  
7. Hither to this (house) hath come the tender child, hither the calf
along with (the other) domestic animals; hither the vessel (full) of
liquor, together with bowls of sour milk!  
8. Carry forth, O woman, this full jar, a stream of ghee mixed with
ambrosia! Do thou these drinkers supply with ambrosia; the sacrifice and
the gifts (to the Brahmans) shall it (the house) protect!  
9. These waters, free from disease, destructive of disease, do I carry
forth. The chambers do I enter in upon together with the immortal Agni
(fire).
