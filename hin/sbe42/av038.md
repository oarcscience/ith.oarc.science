## IV, 6. Charm against poison.

1\. The Brâhmana was the first to be born, with ten heads and ten
mouths. He was the first to drink the soma; that did render poison
powerless.  
2. As great as heaven and earth are in extent, as far as the seven
streams did spread, so far from here have I proclaimed forth this charm
that destroys poison.  
3. The eagle Garutmant did, O poison, first devour thee. Thou didst not
bewilder him, didst not injure him, yea, thou didst turn into food for
him.  
4. The five-fingered hand that did hurl upon thee (the arrow) even from
the curved bow--from the point of the tearing (arrow) have I charmed
away the poison.  
5. From the point (of the arrow) have I charmed away the poison, from
the substance that has been smeared upon it, and from its plume. From
its barbed horn, and its neck, I have charmed away the poison.  
6. Powerless, O arrow, is thy point, and powerless is thy poison.
Moreover of powerless wood is thy powerless bow, O powerless (arrow)!  
7. They that ground (the poison), they that daubed it on, they that
hurled it, and they that let it go, all these have been rendered
impotent. The mountain that grows poisonous plants has been rendered
impotent.  
8. Impotent are they that dig thee, impotent art thou, O plant! Impotent
is that mountain height whence this poison has sprung.
