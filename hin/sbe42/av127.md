## VI, 18. Charm to allay jealousy.

1\. The first impulse of jealousy, moreover the one that comes after the
first, the fire, the heart-burning, that do wc waft away from thee.  
2. As the earth is dead in spirit, in spirit more dead than the dead,
and as the spirit of him that has died, thus shall the spirit of the
jealous (man) be dead!  
3. Yon fluttering little spirit that has been fixed into thy heart, from
it the jealousy do I remove, as air from a water-skin.
