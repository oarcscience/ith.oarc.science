## VI, 96. Plants as a panacea.

1\. The many plants of hundredfold aspect, whose king is Soma, which
have been begotten by Brihaspati, shall free us from calamity!  
2. May they free us from (the calamity) consequent upon curses, and also
from the (toils) of Varuna; moreover, from the foot-fetter of Yama, and
every sin against the gods!  
3. What laws we have infringed upon, with the eye, the mind, and speech,
either while awake, or asleep-may Soma by his (divine) nature clear
these (sins) away from us!
