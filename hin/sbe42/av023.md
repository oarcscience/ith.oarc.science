## III, 7. Charm against kshetriya, hereditary disease.

1\. Upon the head of the nimble antelope a remedy grows! He has driven
the kshetriya (inherited disease) in all directions by means of the
horn.  
2. The antelope has gone after thee with his four feet. O horn, loosen
the kshetriya that is knitted into his heart!  
3. (The horn) that glistens yonder like a roof with four wings (sides),
with that do we drive out every kshetriya from thy limbs.  
4. The lovely twin stars, the vikritau ('the two looseners') that are
yonder upon the sky, shall loosen the nethermost and the uppermost
fetter of the kshetriya!  
5. The waters, verily, are healers, the waters are scatterers of
disease, the waters cure all disease: may they. relieve thee from the
kshetriya!  
6. The kshetriya that has entered into thee from the prepared (magic)
concoction, for that I know the remedy; I drive the kshetriya out of
thee.  
7. When the constellations fade away, and when the dawn does fade away,
(then) shall he shine away from us every evil and the kshetriya!
