## IV, 37. Charm with the plant agasringi to drive out Rakshas, Apsaras and Gandharvas.

1\. With thee, O herb, the Atharvans first slew the Rakshas, with thee
Kasyapa slew (them), with thee Kanva and Agastya (slew them).  
2. With thee do we scatter the Apsaras and Gandharvas. O agasringi
(odina pinnata), goad (aga) the Rakshas, drive them all away with thy
smell!  
3. The Apsaras, Guggulil, I'lli, Naladi, Aukshagandhi, and Pramandani
(by name), shall go to the river, to the ford of the waters, as if blown
away! Thither do ye, O Apsaras, pass away, (since) ye have been
recognised!  
4. Where grow the asvattha (ficus religiosa) and the banyan-trees, the
great trees with crowns, thither do ye, O Apsaras, pass away, (since) ye
have been recognised!  
5. Where your gold and silver swings are, where cymbals and lutes chime
together, thither do ye, O Apsaras, pass away, (since) ye have been
recog\~ nised.  
6. Hither has come the mightiest of the plants and herbs. May the
agasringi arâtaki pierce with her sharp horn (tîkshmasringî)!  
7. Of the crested Gandharva, the husband of the Apsaras, who comes
dancing hither, I crush the two mushkas and cut off the sepas.  
8. Terrible are the missiles of Indra, with a hundred points, brazen;
with these he shall pierce the Gandharvas, who devour oblations, and
devour the avakâ-reed.  
9. Terrible are the missiles of Indra, with a hundred points, golden;
with these he shall pierce the Gandharvas, who devour oblations, and
devour the avakd-reed.  
10. All the Pisâkas that devour the avakâ-reeds, that burn, and spread
their little light in the waters, do thou, O herb, crush and overcome!  
11. One is like a dog, one like an ape. As a youth, with luxuriant
locks, pleasant to look upon, the Gandharva hangs about the woman. Him
do we drive out from here with our powerful charm.  
12. The Apsaras, you know, are your wives; ye, the Gandharvas, are their
husbands. Speed away, ye immortals, do not go after mortals!
