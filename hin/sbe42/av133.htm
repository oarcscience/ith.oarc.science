</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 110. Expiatory charm for a child born under an unlucky star.</h2>  
<p>1. Of yore, (O Agni), thou wast worthy of supplication at the sacrifice; thou wast the priest in olden times, and now anew shalt sit (at our sacrifice)! Delight, O Agni, thy own body, and, sacrificing, bring good fortune here to us!<br> 2. Him that hath been born under the (constellation) gyeshihaghn&icirc; ('she that slays the oldest'), or under the vikrit&acirc;u ('they that uproot'), save thou from being torn up by the root by Yama (death)! May be (Agni) guide him across all misfortunes to long life, to a life of a hundred autumns!<br> 3. On a tiger (-like) day the hero was born; born under a (good) constellation he becometh a mighty hero. Let him not slay, when he grows up, his father, let him not injure the mother that hath begotten him!</p>
