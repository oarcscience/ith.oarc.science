## VII, 53. Prayer for long life.

1\. When, O Brihaspati, thou didst liberate (us) from existence in
yonder world of Yama, (and) from hostile schemes, then did the Asvins,
the physicians of the gods, with might sweep death from us, O Agni!  
2. O in-breathing and out-breathing, go along with the body, do not
leave it: may they be thy allies here! Live and thrive a hundred
autumns; Agni shall be thy most excellent shepherd and overseer!  
3. Thy vital force that has been dissipated afar, thy in-breathing and
thy out-breathing, shall come back again! Agni has snatched them from
the lap of Nirriti (the goddess of destruction), and I again introduce
them into thy person.  
4. Let not his in-breathing desert him, nor his out-breathing quit him
and depart! I commit him to the Seven Rishis: may they convey him in
health to old age!  
5. Enter, O in-breathing and out-breathing, like two bulls into a
stable: this person shall here flourish, an unmolested repository for
old age!  
6. Life's breath we do drive into thee, disease we do drive away from
thee. May this excellent Agni endow us with life from every source!  
7. Ascending from the darkness of death to the highest firmament, to
Sûrya (the sun), the god among gods, we have reached the highest light.
