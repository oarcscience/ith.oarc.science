## VIII, 8. Battle-charm.

1\. May Indra churn (the enemy), he, the churner, Sakra (mighty), the
hero, that pierces the forts, so that we shall slay the armies of the
enemies a thousandfold!  
2. May the rotten rope, wafting itself against yonder army, turn it into
a stench. When the enemies see from afar our smoke and fire, fear shall
they lay into their hearts!  
3. Tear asunder those (enemies), O asvattha (ficus religiosa), devour
(khâda) them, O! khadira (acacia catechu) in lively style! Like the
tâgadbhanga (ricinus communis) they shall be broken (bhagyantâm), may
the vadhaka (a certain kind of tree) slay them with his weapons
(vadhaih)!  
4. May the knotty âhva-plant put knots upon yonder (enemies), may the
vadhaka slay them with his weapons! Bound up in (our) great trap-net,
they shall quickly be broken as an arrow-reed!  
5. The atmosphere was the net, the great regions (of space) the
(supporting) poles of the net: with these Sakra (mighty Indra) did
surround and scatter the army of the Dasyus.  
6. Great, forsooth, is the net of great Sakra, who is rich in steeds:
with it infold thou all the enemies, so that not one of them shall be
released!  
7. Great is the net of thee, great Indra, hero, that art equal to a
thousand, and hast hundredfold might. With that (net) Sakra slew a
hundred, thousand, ten thousand, a hundred million foes, having
surrounded them with (his) army.  
8. This great world was the net of great Sakra: with this net of Indra I
infold all those (enemies) yonder in darkness,  
9. With great dejection, failure, and irrefragable misfortune; with
fatigue, lassitude, and confusion, do I surround all those (enemies)
yonder.  
10. To death do I hand them over, with the fetters of death they have
been bound. To the evil messengers of death do I lead them captive.  
11. Guide ye those (foes), ye messengers of death; ye messengers of
Yama, infold them! Let more than thousands be slain; may the club of
Bhava crush them!  
12. The Sâdhyas (blessed) go holding up with might one support of the
net, the Rudras another, the Vasus another, (Still) another is upheld by
the Âdityas.  
13. All the gods shall go pressing from above with might; the Angiras
shall go on the middle (of the net), slaying the mighty army!  
14. The trees, and (growths) that are like trees, the plants and the
herbs as well; two-footed and four-footed creatures do I impel, that
they shall slay yonder army!  
15. The Gandharvas and Apsaras, the serpents and the gods, holy men and
(deceased) Fathers, the visible and invisible (beings), do I impel, that
they shall slay yonder army!  
16. Scattered here are the fetters of death; when thou steppest upon
them thou shalt not escape! May this hammer slay (the men) of yonder
army by the thousand!  
17. The gharma (sacrificial hot drink) that has been heated by the fire,
this sacrifice (shall) slay thousands! Do ye, Bhava and Sarva, whose
arms are mottled, slay yonder army!  
18. Into the (snare of) death they shall fall, into hunger, exhaustion,
slaughter, and fear! O Indra and Sarva, do ye with trap and net slay
yonder army!  
19. Conquered, O foes, do ye flee away; repelled by (our) charm, do ye
run! Of yonder host, repulsed by Brihaspati, not one shall be saved!  
20. May their weapons fall from their (hands), may they be unable to lay
the arrow on (the bow)! And then (our) arrows shall smite them, badly
frightened, in their vital members!  
21. Heaven and earth shall shriek at them, and the atmosphere, along
with the divine powers! Neither aider, nor support did they find;
smiting one another they shall go to death!  
22. The four regions are the she-mules of the god's chariot, the
purodâsas (sacrificial rice-cakes) the hoofs, the atmosphere the seat
(of the wagon). Heaven and earth are its two sides, the seasons the
reins, the intermediate regions the attendants, Vâk (speech) the road.  
23. The year is the chariot, the full year is the body of the chariot,
Virâg, the pole, Agni the front part of the chariot. Indra is the
(combatant) standing on the left of the chariot, Kandramas (the moon)
the charioteer.  
24. Do thou win here, do thou conquer here, overcome, win, hail! These
here shall conquer, those yonder be conquered! Hail to these here,
perdition to those yonder! Those yonder do I envelop in blue and red!
