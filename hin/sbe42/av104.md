## VI, 82. Charm for obtaining a wife.

1\. I call the name of him that comes here, that hath come here, and is
arriving; I crave (the name) of Indra, Vritra's slayer, the Visava, of
hundredfold strength.  
2. The road by which the Asvins carried away as a bride Sûryâ, Savitar's
daughter,'by that road,' Bhaga (fortune) told me, 'thou shalt bring here
a wife'!  
With thy wealth-procuring, great, golden hook, O Indra, husband of Sakî,
procure a wife for me that desireth a wife!
