## VI, 85. Exorcism of disease by means of an amulet from the varana-tree.

1\. This divine tree, the varana, shall shut out (vârayâtai). The gods,
too, have shut out (avîvaran) the disease that hath entered into this
man!  
2. By Indra's command, by Mitra's and by Varuna's, by the command of all
the gods do we shut out thy disease.  
3. As Vritra did bold fast these ever-flowing waters, thus do I shut out
(vâraye) disease from thee with (the help of) Agni Vaisvânara.
