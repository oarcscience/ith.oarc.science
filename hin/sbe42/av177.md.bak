## III, 15. A merchant's prayer.

1\. Indra, the merchant, do I summon: may he come to us, may he be our
van; driving away the demon of grudge, the waylayers, and wild beasts,
may he, the possessor, bestow wealth upon me!  
2. May the many paths, the roads of the gods, which come together
between heaven and earth, c,ladden me with milk and ghee, so that I may
gather in wealth from my purchases!  
3. Desirous do I, O Agni, with firewood and ghee offer oblations (to
thee), for success and strength; according to ability praising (thee)
with my prayer, do I sing this divine song, that I may gain a
hundredfold!  
4. (Pardon, O Agni, this sin of ours \[incurred upon\] the far road
which we have travelled!) May our purchases and our sales be successful
for us; may what I get in barter render me a gainer! May ye two (Indra
and Agni) in accord take pleasure in this oblation! May our transactions
and the accruing gain be auspicious to us!  
5. The wealth with which I go to purchase, desiring, ye gods, to gain
wealth through wealth, may that grow more, not less! Drive away, O Agni,
in return for the oblation, the gods who shut off gain!  
6. The wealth with which I go to purchase, desiring, ye gods, to gain
wealth through wealth, may Indra, Pragâpati, Savitar, Soma, Agni, place
lustre into it for me!  
7. We praise with reverence thee, O priest (Agni) Vaisvdnara. Do thou
over our children, selves, cattle, and life's breath watch!  
8. Daily, never failing, shall we bring (oblations to thee), O
Gâtavedas, (as if fodder) to a horse standing (in the stable). In growth
of wealth and nutriment rejoicing, may we, O Agni, thy neighbours, not
take harm!
