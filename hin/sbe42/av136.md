## III, 3. Charm for the restoration of an exiled king.

1\. (Agni) has shouted loud: may he here well perform his work! Spread
thyself out, O Agni, over the far-reaching hemispheres of the world! The
all-possessing Maruts shall engage thee: bring hither that (king) who
devoutly spends the offering!  
2. However far he be, the red (steeds) shall urge hither Indra, the
seer, to friendship, since the gods, (chanting) for him the gâyatri, the
brihatî, and the arka (songs), infused courage into him with the
sautrâmanî-sacrifice!  
3. From the waters king Varuna shall call thee, Soma shall call thee
from the mountains, Indra shall cite thee to these clans! Turn into an
eagle and fly to these clans!  
4. An eagle shall bring hither from a distance him that is fit to be
called, (yet) wanders exiled in a strange land! The Asvins shall prepare
for thee a path, easy to travel! Do ye, his kinfolk, gather close about
him!  
5. Thy opponents shall call thee; thy friends have chosen. thee! Indra,
Agni, and all the gods have kept prosperity with this people.  
6. The kinsman or the stranger that opposes thy call, him, O Indra,
drive away; then render this (king) accepted here!
