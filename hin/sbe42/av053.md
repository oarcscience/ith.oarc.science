## II, 25. Charm with the plant prisniparnî against the demon of disease, called kanva.

1\. The goddess Prisniparnî has prepared prosperity for us, mishap for
Nirriti (the goddess of destruction). For she is a fierce devourer of
the Kanvas: her, the mighty, have I employed.  
2. The Prisniparnî was first begotten powerful; with her do I lop off
the heads of the evil brood, as (the head) of a bird.  
3. The blood-sucking demon, and him that tries to rob (our) health,
Kanva, the devourer of our offspring, destroy, O Prisniparnî, and
overcome!  
4. These Kanvas, the effacers of life, drive into the mountain; go thou
burning after them like fire, O goddess Prisniparnî!  
5. Drive far away these Kanvas, the effacers of life! Where the dark
regions are, there have I made these flesh-eaters go.
