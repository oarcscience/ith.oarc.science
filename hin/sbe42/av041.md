## VI, 13 Charm against snake-poison.

1\. Varuna, the sage of heaven, verily lends (power) to rne. With mighty
charms do I dissolve thy poison. The (poison) which has been dug, that
which has not been dug, and that which is inherent, I have held fast. As
a brook in the desert thy poison has dried up.  
2. That poison of thine which is not fluid I have confined within these
(serpents?). I hold fast the sap that is in thy middle, thy top, and in
thy bottom, too. May (the sap) now vanish out of thee from fright!  
3. My lusty shout (is) as the thunder with the cloud: then do I smite
thy (sap) with my strong charm. With manly strength I have held fast
that sap of his. May the sun rise as light from the darkness!  
4. With my eye do I slay thy eye, with poison do I slay thy poison. O
serpent, die, do not live; back upon thee shall thy poison turn!  
5. O kairâta, speckled one, upatrinya (grass-dweller?), brown one,
listen to me; ye black repulsive reptiles, (listen to me)! Do not stand
upon the ground of my friend; cease with your poison and make it known
(to people?)!  
6. I release (thee) from the fury of the black serpent, the taimâta, the
brown serpent, the poison that is not fluid, the all-conquering, as the
bowstring (is loosened) from the bow, as chariots (from horses).  
7. Both Âligî and Viligî, both father and mother, we know your kin
everywhere. Deprived of your strength what will ye do?  
8. The daughter of urugûlâ, the evil one born with the black--of all
those who have run to their hiding-place the poison is devoid of
force.  
9. The prickly porcupine, tripping down from the mountain, did declare
this: 'Whatsoever serpents, living in ditches, are here, their poison is
most deficient in force.'  
10. Tâbuvam (or) not tâbuvam, thou (O serpent) art not tâbuvam. Through
tâbuvam thy poison is bereft of force.  
11. Tastuvam (or) not tastuvam, thou (O serpent) art not tastuvam.
Through tastuvarn thy poison is bereft of force.
