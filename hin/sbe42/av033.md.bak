## VI, 109. The pepper-corn as a cure for wounds.

1\. The pepper-corn cures the wounds that have been struck by missiles,
it also cures the wounds from stabs. Anent it the gods decreed:
'Powerful to secure life this (plant) shall be!'  
2. The pepper-corns spake to one another, as they came out, after having
been created: 'He whom we shall find (as yet) alive, that man shall not
suffer harm!'  
3. The Asuras did dig thee into the ground, the gods cast thee up again,
as a cure for disease produced by wind (in the body), moreover as a cure
for wounds struck by missiles.
