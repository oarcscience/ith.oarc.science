## VI, 111. Charm against mania.

1\. Release for me, O Agni, this person here, who, bound and
well-secured, loudly jabbers! Then shall he have due regard for thy
share (of the offering), when he shall be free from madness!  
2. Agni shall quiet down thy mind, if it has been disturbed! Cunningly
do I prepare a remedy, that thou shalt be freed from madness.  
3. (Whose mind) has been maddened by the sin of the gods, or been robbed
of sense by the Rakshas, (for him) do I cunningly prepare a remedy, that
he shall be free from madness.  
4. May the Apsaras restore thee, may Indra, may Bhaga restore thee; may
all the gods restore thee, that thou mayest be freed from madness!
