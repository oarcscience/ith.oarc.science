## VII, 38. Charm to secure the love of a man.

1\. This potent herb do I dig out: it draws toward me the eve, causes
(love's) tears. It brings back him who has gone to a distance, rejoices
him that approaches me.  
2. By (the plant) with which the Âsurî allured Indra away from the gods,
by that do I subject thee, that I may be well-beloved of thee!  
3. Thy face is turned towards Soma (the nioon), thy face is turned
towards Sûrya (the sun), thy face is turned towards all the gods: 't is
tliee here that we do invoke.  
4. My speech, not thine, (in this matter) hath weight: in the assembly,
forsooth, do thou speak! To me alone shalt thou belong, shalt not even
discourse of other women!  
5. Whether thou art beyond the haunts of men, or whether across the
river, this very herb, as if a captive bound, shall bring, thee back to
me!
