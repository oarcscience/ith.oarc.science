## VI, 74. Charm to allay discord.

1\. May your bodies be united, may your mindg and your purposes (be
united)! Brahmanaspati here has brought you together, Bhaga has brought
you together.  
2. Harmony of mind (I procure) for you, and also harmony of heart.
Moreover with the aid of Bhaga's exertions do I cause you to agree.  
3. As the Âdityas are united with the Vasus, as the fierce (Rudras),
free from grudge, with the Maruts, thus, O three-named (Agni), without
grudge, do thou render these people here of the same mind!
