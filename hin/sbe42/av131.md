## VI, 138. Charm for depriving a man of his virility.

1\. As the best of the plants thou art reputed, O herb: turn this man
for me to-day into a eunuch that wears his hair dressed!  
2. Turn him into a eunuch that wears his hair dressed, and into one that
wears a hood! Then Indra with a pair of stones shall break his testicles
both!  
3. O eunuch, into a eunuch thee I have turned;O castrate, into a
castrate thee I have turned; O weakling, into a weakling thee I have
turned! A hood upon his head, and a hair-net do we place.  
4. The two canals, fashioned by the gods, in which man's power rests, in
thy testicles . . . . . . . . . . . . I break them with a club.  
5. As women break reeds for a mattress with a stone, thus do I break thy
member.
