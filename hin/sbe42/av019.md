## VI, 24. Dropsy, heart-disease, and kindred maladies cured by flowing water.

1\. From the Himavant (mountains) they flow forth, in the Sindhu
(Indus), forsooth, is their assembling-place: may the waters, indeed,
grant me that cure for heart-ache!  
2. The pain that hurts me in the eyes, and that which hurts in the heels
and the fore-feet, the waters, the most skilled of physicians, shall put
all that to rights!  
3. Ye rivers all, whose mistress is Sindhu, whose queen is Sindhu, grant
us the remedy for that: through this (remedy) may we derive benefit from
you!
