## III, 18. Charm of a woman against a rival or co-wife.

1\. I dig up this plant, of herbs the most potent, by whose power rival
women are overcome, and husbands are obtained.  
2. O thou (plant) with erect leaves, lovely, do thou, urged on by the
gods, full of might, drive away my rival, make my h usband mine alone!  
3. He did not, forsooth, call thy name, and thou shalt not delight in
this' husband! To the very farthest distance do we drive our rival.  
4. Superior am I, O superior (plant), superior, truly, to superior
(women). Now shall my rival be inferior to those that are inferior!  
5. I am overpowering, and thou, (O plant), art completely overpowering.
Having both grown full of power, let us overpower my rival!  
6. About thee (my husband) I have placed the overpowering (plant), upon
thee placed the very overpowering one. May thy mind run after me as a
calf after the cow, as water along its course!
