## II, 12. Imprecation against enemies thwarting holy work.

1\. Heaven and earth, the broad atmosphere, the goddess of the field,
and the wonderful, far-striding (Vishnu); moreover, the broad atmosphere
guarded by Vâta (the wind): may these here be inflamed, when I am
inflamed!  
2. Hear this, O ye revered gods! Let Bharadvâga recite for me songs of
praise! 'May he who injures this our plan be bound in the fetter (of
disease) and joined to misfortune!  
3. Hear, O soma-drinking Indra, what with burning heart I shout to thee!
I cleave, as one cleaves a tree with an axe, him that injures this our
plan.  
4. With (the aid of) thrice eighty siman-singers, with (the aid of) the
Âdityas, Vasus, and Angiras--may our father's sacrifices and gifts to
the priests, aid us-do I seize this one with fateful fervour.  
5. May heaven and earth look after me, may all the gods support me! O ye
Angiras, O ye fathers devoted to Soma, may he who does harm enter into
misfortune!  
6 . He who perchance despises us, O ye Maruts, he who abuses the holy
practice which is beiog performed by us, may his evil deeds be
firebrands to him, may the heavens surround with fire the hater of holy
practices!  
7. Thy seven in-breathings and thy eight marrows, these do I cut for
thee by means of my charm. Thou shalt go to the seat of Yama, fitly
prepared, with Agni as thy guide!  
8. I set thy footstep upon the kindled fire. May Agni surround thy body,
may thy voice enter into breath!
