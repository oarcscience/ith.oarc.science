## VII, 74. A. Charm for curing scrofulous sores called apakit.

1\. We have heard it said that the mother of the black Apakit (pustules)
is red: with the root (found by) the divine sage do I strike all
these.  
2. I strike the foremost one of them, and I strike also the middlemost
of them; this hindmost one I cut off as a flake (of wool).

### B. Charm to appease jealousy.

3\. With Tvashtar's charm I have sobered down thy jealousy; also thy
anger, O lord, we have quieted.

### C. Prayer to Agni, the lord of vows.

4\. Do thou, O lord of vows, adorned with vows, ever benevolently here
shine! May we all, adoring thee, when thou hast been kindled, O
Gâtavedas, be rich in offspring!
