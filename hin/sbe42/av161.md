## VII, 12. Charm to procure influence in the assembly.

1\. May assembly and meeting, the two daughters of Pragâpati,
concurrently aid me! May he with whom I shall meet co-operate with me,
may I, O ye Fathers, speak agreeably to those assembled!  
2. We know thy name, O assembly: 'mirth,' verily, is thy name; may all
those that sit assembled in thee utter speech in harmony with me!  
3. Of them that are sitting together I take to myself the power and the
understanding: in this entire vathering render, O Indra, me
successful!  
4. If your mind has wandered to a distance, or has been enchained here
or there, then do we turn it hither: may your mind take delight in me!
