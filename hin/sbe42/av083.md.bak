## IV, 20. Charm with a certain plant (sadampushpâ) which exposes demons and enemies.

1\. He sees here, he sees yonder, he sees in the distance, he sees--the
sky, the atmosphere as well as the earth, all that, O goddess, he
sees.  
2. The three heavens, the three earths, and these six directions
severally; all creatures may I see through thee, O divine plant!  
3. Thou art verily the eyeball of the divine eagle; thou didst ascend
the earth as a weary woman a palanquin.  
4. The thousand-eyed god shall put this plant into my right hand: with
that do I see every one, the Sûdra as well as the Ârya.  
5. Reveal (all) forms, do not hide thy own self; moreover, do thou, O
thousand-eyed (plant), look the Kimîdins in the face!  
6. Reveal to me the wizards, and reveal the witches, reveal all the
Pisâkas: for this purpose do I take hold of thee, O plant!  
7. Thou art the eye of Kasyapa, and the eye of the four-eyed bitch. Like
the sun, moving in the bright day, make thou the Pisâka evident to me!  
8. I have dragged out from his retreat the sorcerer and the Kimîdin.
Through this (charm) do I see every one, the Sûdra as well as the
Ârya.  
9. Him that flies in the air, him that moves across the sky, him that
regards the earth as his resort, that Pisâka do thou reveal (to me)!
