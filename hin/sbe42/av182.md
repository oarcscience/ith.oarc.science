## XI, 2. Prayer to Bhava and Sarva for protection from dangers.

1\. O Bhava and Sarva, be merciful, do not attack (us); ye lords of
beings, lords of cattle, reverence be to you twain! Discharge not your
arrow even after it has been laid on (the bow), and has been drawn!
Destroy not our bipeds and our quadrupeds!  
2. Prepare not our bodies for the dog, or the jackal; for the aliklavas,
the vultures, and the black birds! Thy greedy insects, O lord of cattle
(pasupate), and thy birds shall not get us to devour!  
3. Reverence we offer, O Bhava, to thy roaring, to thy breath, and to
thy injurious qualities; reverence to thee, O Rudra, thousand-eyed,
immortal!  
4. We offer reverence to thee from the east, from the north, and from
the -south; from (every) domain, and from heaven. Reverence be to thy
atmosphere!  
5. To thy face, O lord of cattle, to thy eyes, O Bhava, to thy skin, to
thy form, thy appearance, (and to thy aspect) from behind, reverence
be!  
6. To thy limbs, to thy belly, to thy tongue, to thy mouth, to thy
teeth, to thy smell (nose), reverence be!  
7. May we not conflict with Rudra, the archer with the dark crest, the
thousand-eyed, powerful one, the slayer of Ardhaka!  
8. Bhava shall steer clear from us on all sides, Bhava shall steer clear
from us, as fire from water! May he not bear malice towards us:
reverence be to him!  
9. Four times, eight times, be reverence to Bhava, ten times be
reverence to thee, O lord of cattle! To thy (charge) have been assigned
these five (kinds of) cattle: cows, horses, men, goats and sheep.  
10. Thine, O strong god (ugra), are the four regions, thine the sky,
thine the earth, and thine this broad atmosphere; thine is this all that
has a spirit and has breath upon the earth.  
11. Thine is this broad, treasure-holding receptacle within which all
worlds are contained. Do thou spare us, O lord of cattle: reverence be
to thee! Far from us shall go the jackals, evil omens, dogs; far shall
go (the mourning women) who bewail rnisfortune with dishevelled hair!  
12. Thou, O crested (god), carriest in (thy hand), that smites
thousands, a yellow, golden bow that slays hundreds; Rudra's arrow, the
missile of the gods, flies abroad: reverence be to it, in whatever
direction from here (it flies)!  
13. The adversary who lurks and seeks to overcome thee, O Rudra, upon
him thou dost fasten thyself from behind, as (the hunter) that follows
the trail of a wounded (animal).  
14. Bhava and Rudra, united and concordant, both strong (ugrau), ye
advance to deeds of heroism: reverence be to both of them, in whatever
direction (they are) from here!  
15. Reverence be to thee coming, reverence to thee going; reverence, O
Rudra, be to thee standing, and reverence, also, to thee sitting!  
16. Reverence in the evening, reverence in the morning, reverence by
night,reverence byday! I have offered reverence to Bhava and to Sarva,
both.  
17. Let us not with our tongue offend Rudra, who rushes on,
thousand-eyed, overseeing all, who hurls (his shafts) forward, who is
manifoldly wise!  
18. We approach first the (god) that has dark horses, is black, sable,
destructive, terrible, who casts down the car of Kesin: reverence be to
him!  
19. Do not hurl at us thy club, thy divine bolt; be not incensed at us,
O lord of cattle! Shake over some other than us the celestial branch!  
20. Injure us not, interpose for us, spare us, be not angry with us! Let
us not contend with thee!  
21. Do not covet our cattle, our men, our goats and sheep! Bend thy
course elsewhere, O strong god (ugra), slay the offspring of the
blasphemers!  
22. He whose missile, fever and cough, assails the single (victim), as
the snorting of a stallion, who snatches away (his victims) one by one,
to him be reverence!  
23. He who dwells fixed in the atmosphere, smiting the blasphemers of
the god that do not sacrifice, to him be reverence with ten
sakvarî-stanzas!  
24. For thee the wild beasts of the forest have been placed in the
forest: flamingoes, eagles, birds of prey, and fowls. Thy spirit, O lord
of cattle, is within the waters, to strengthen thee the heavenly waters
flow.  
25. The dolphins, great serpents (boas), purîkayas (water-animals),
sea-monsters, fishes, ragasas at which thou shootest-there exists for
thee, O Bhava, no distance, and no barrier. At a glance thou lookest
around the entire earth; from the eastern thou slayest in the northern
ocean.  
26. Do not, O Rudra, contaminate us with fever, or with poison, or with
heavenly fire: cause this lightning to descend elsewhere than upon us!  
27. Bhava rules the sky, Bhava rules the earth; Bhava has filled the
broad: atmosphere. Reverence be to him in whatever direction from here
(he abides)!  
28. O king Bhava, be merciful to thy worshipper, for thou art the lord
of living beasts! He who believes the gods exist, to his quadruped and
biped be merciful!  
29. Slay neither our great nor our small; neither those of us that are
riding, nor those that shall ride; neither our father, nor our mother.
Cause no injury, O Rudra, to our own persons!  
30. To Rudra's howling dogs, who swallow their food without blessing,
who have wide jaws, I have made this obeisance.  
31. Reverence, O god, be to thy shouting hosts, reverence to thy
long-haired, reverence to thy reverenced, reverence to thy devouring
hosts! May well-being and security be to us!
