## VI, 71. Brahmanical prayer at the receipt of gifts.

1\. The varied food which I consume in many places, my gold, my horses,
and, too, my cows, goats, and sheep: everything whatsoever that I have
received as a gift--may Agni, the priest, render that an auspicious
offering!  
2. The gift that has come to me by sacrifice, or without sacrifice,
bestowed by the Fathers, granted by men, through which my heart, as it
were, lights up with joy--may Agni, the priest, render that an
auspicious offering!  
3. The food that I, O gods, improperly consume, (the food) I promise,
intending to give of it (to the Brahmans), or not to give of it, by the
might of mighty Vaisvânara (Agni) may (that) food be for me auspicious
and full of honey!
