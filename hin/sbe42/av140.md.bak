## I, 9. Prayer for earthly and heavenly success.

1\. Upon this (person) the Vasus, Indra, Pûshan, Varuna, Mitra, and
Agni, shall bestow goods (vasu)! The Âdityas, and, further, all the gods
shall hold him in the higher light!  
2. Light, ye gods, shall be at his bidding: Sûrya (the sun), Agni
(fire), or even gold! Inferior to us shall be our rivals! Cause him to
ascend to the highest heaven  
3. With that most potent charm with which, O Gâtavedas (Agni), thou
didst bring to Indra the (soma-) drink, with that, O Agni, do thou here
strengthen this one; grant him supremacy over his kinsmen!  
4. Their sacrifice and their glory, their increase of wealth and their
thoughtful plans, I have usurped, O Agni. Inferior to us shall be our
rivals! Cause him to ascend to the highest heaven!
