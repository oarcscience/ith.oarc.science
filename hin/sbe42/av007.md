## XIX, 39. Prayer to the kushtha-plant to destroy takman (fever), and other ailments.

1\. May the protecting god kushtha come hither from the Himavant:
destroy thou every takman, and all female spooks!  
2. Three names hast thou, O kushtha, (namely: kushtha), na-ghâ-mâra
('forsooth-no-death'), and na-ghâ-risha ('forsooth-no-harm'). Verily no
harm shall suffer (na ghâ . . . rishat) this person here, for whom I
bespeak thee morn and eve, aye the (entire) day!  
3. Thy mother's name is gîvalâ ('quickening'), thy father's name is
gîvanta ('living'). Verily no harm shall suffer this person here, for
whom I bespeak thee morn and eve, aye the entire day!  
4. Thou art the most superior of the plants, as a steer among cattle, as
the tiger among beasts of prey. Verily no harm shall stiffer this person
here, for whom I bespeak thee morn and eve, aye the entire day!  
5. Thrice begotten by the Sâmbu Angiras, thrice by the Âdityas, and
thrice by all the gods, this kushtha, a universal remedy, stands
together with soma. Destroy thou every takman, and all female spooks!  
6. The asvattha-tree is the seat of the gods in the third heaven from
here. There came to sight the amrita (ambrosia), there the kushtha-plant
was born.  
7. A golden ship with golden tackle moved upon the heavens. There came
to sight the amrita, there the kushtha-plant was born.  
8. On the spot where the ship glided down, on the peak of the Himavant,
there came to sight the ambrosia, there the kushtha-plant was born. This
kushtha, a universal remedy, stands together with soma. Destroy thou
every takman, and all female spooks!  
9. (We know) thee whom Ikshvâku knew of yore, whom the women, fond of
kushtha, knew, whom Vâyasa and Mâtsya knew: therefore art thou a
universal remedy.  
10. The takman that returns on each third day, the one that cominues
without intermission, and the yearly one, ao thou, (O plant) of
unremitting strength, drive away down below!
