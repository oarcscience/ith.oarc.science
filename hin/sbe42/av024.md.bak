## I, 23. Leprosy cured by a dark plant.

1\. Born by night art thou, O plant, dark, black, sable. Do thou, that
art rich in colour, stain this leprosy, and the gray spots!  
2. The leprosy and the gray spots drive away from here--may thy native
colour settle upon thee--the white spots cause to fly away!  
3. Sable is thy hiding-place, sable thy dwelling-place, sable art thou,
O plant: drive away from here the speckled spots!  
4. The leprosy which has originated in the bones, and that which has
originated in the body and upon the skin, the white mark begotten of
corruption, I have destroyed with my charm.
