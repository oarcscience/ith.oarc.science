## I, 11. Charm for easy parturition.

1\. Aryaman as active hotar-priest shall utter for thee the vashat-call
at this (soma-) pressing, O Pûshan! May (this) woman, (herself) begotten
in  
the proper way, be delivered, may her joints relax, that she shall bring
forth!  
2. Four directions has the heaven, and also four the earth: (from these)
the gods created the embryo. May they open her, that she shall bring
forth!  
3. May Sûshan open: her womb do we cause to gape. Do thou, O Sûshan,
loosen the womb, do thou, O Bishkalâ, let go (the ernbryo)!  
4. Attached not at all to the flesh, nor to the fat, not at all to the
marrow, may the splotched, moist, placenta come down to be eaten by a
dog! May the placenta fall down!  
5. I split open thy vagina, thy womb, thy canals; I separate the mother
and the son, the child along with the placenta. May the placenta fall
down!  
6. As flies the wind, as flies the mind, as fly the winged birds, so do
thou, O embryo,. ten months old, fall along with the placenta! May the
placenta fall down!
