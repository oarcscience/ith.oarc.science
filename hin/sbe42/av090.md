## V, 14. Charm to repel sorceries or spells.

1\. An eagle found thee out, a boar dug thee out with his snout. Seek
thou, O plant, to injure him that seeks to injure (us), strike down him
that prepares spells (against us'!  
2. Strike down the wizards, strike down him that prepares spells
(against us); slay thou, moreover, O plant, him that seeks to injure
us!  
3. Cutting out from the skin (of the enemy) as if (from the skin) of an
antelope, do ye, O gods, fasten the spell upon him that prepares it, as
(one fastens) an ornament!  
4. Take hold by the hand and lead away the spell back to him that
prepares it! Place it in his very presence, so that it shall slay him
that prepares the spell!  
5. The spells shall take effect upon him that prepares the spells, the
curse upon him that pronounces the curse! As a chariot with easy-going
wheels, the spell shall turn back upon him that prepares the spell!  
6. Whether a woman, or whether a man has prepared the spell for evil, we
lead that spell to him as a horse with the halter.  
7. Whether thou hast been prepared by the gods, or hast been prepared by
men, we lead thee back with the help of Indra as an ally.  
8. O Agni gainer of battles, do thou gain the battles! With a
counter-charm do we hurl back the spell upon him that prepares the
spell.  
9. Hold ready, (O plant,) thy weapon, and strike him, slay the very one
that has prepared (the spell)! We do not whet thee for the destruction
of him that has not practised (spells).  
10. Go as a son to his father, bite like an adder that has been stepped
upon. Return thou, O spell, to him that prepares the spell, as one who
overcomes his fetters!  
11. As the shy deer, the antelope, goes out to the mating (buck), thus
the spell shall reach him that prepares it!  
12. Straighter than an arrow may it (the spell) fly against him, O ye
heaven and earth; may that spell take hold again of him that prepares
it, as (a hunter)  
of his game!  
13. Like fire (the spell) shall progress in the teeth of obstacles, like
water along its course! As a chariot with easy-going wheels the spell
shall turn back upon him that prepares the spell!
