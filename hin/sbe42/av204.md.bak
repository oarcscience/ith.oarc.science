## XII, 3. The preparation of the brahmaudana, the porridge given as a fee to the Brahmans.

1\. (Thyself) a male, step thou upon the hide of the male (steer): go,
call thither all that is dear to thee! At whatever age ye two formerly
did first unite (in marriage), may that age be your common lot in Yama's
kingdom!  
2. Your sight shall be as clear (as formerly), your strength as
abundant, your lustre as great, your vitality as manifold! When Agni,
the (funeral-) pyre, fastens himself upon the corpse, then as a pair
ye.shall rise from the (cooked) porridge!  
3. Come ye together in this world, upon the road to the gods, and in
Yama's realms! By purifications purified call ye together the offspring
that has sprung from you!  
4. Around the water united, sit ye down, O children; around this living
(father) and the waters that refresh the living! Partake of these
(waters), and of that porridge which the mother of you two cooks, and
which is called amrita (ambrosia)!  
5. The porridge which the father of you two, and which the mother cooks,
unto freedom from defilement and foulness of speech, that porridge with
a hundred streams (of ghee), leading to heaven, has penetrated with
might both the hemispheres of the world.  
6. In that one of the two hemispheres and the two heavenly worlds,
conquered by the pious, which especially abounds in light, and is rich
in honey, in that do ye in the fulness of time come together with your
children!  
7. Keep ever on in an easterly direction: this is the region that the
faithful cling to! When your cooked porridge has been prepared on the
fire, hold together, O man and wife, that ye may guard it!  
8. When ye shall have reached the southerly direction, turn ye to this
vessel! In that Yama, associated with the fathers, shall give abundant
protection to your cooked porridge!  
9. This westerly direction is especially favoured: in it Soma is ruler
and consoler. To this hold, attach yourselves to the pious: then as a
pair ye shall rise from the cooked porridge!  
10. The northerly direction shall make our realm the very uppermost, in
offspring, uppermost! The purusha is the metre pahkti: with all (our
kin), endowed with all their limbs, may we be united!  
11. This 'firm' direction (nadir) is Virâg (brilliancy): reverence be to
her; may she be kind to my children and to me! Mayest thou, O goddess
Aditi, who boldest all treasures, as an alert guardian guard the cooked
porridge!  
12. As a father his children do thou, (O earth), embrace us; may gentle
winds blow upon us here on earth! Then the porridge which the two
divinities (the sacrificer and his wife) are here preparing for us shall
take note of our religious fer\~our and our truth!  
13. Whatever the black bird, that has come hither stealthily, has
touched of that ahich has stuck to the rim, or whatever the wet-banded
slavegirl does pollute-may ye, O waters, purify (that) mortar and
pestle!  
14. May this sturdy press-stone, with broad bottom, purified by the
purifiers, beat away the Rakshas! Settle upon the skin, afford firm
protection; may man and wife not come to grief in their children!  
15. The (pestle of) wood has come to us together with the gods: it
drives away the Rakshas and Pisâkas. Up it shall rise, shall let its
voice resound  
through it let us conquer all the worlds!  
16. The cattle clothed itself in sevenfold strength, those among them
that are sleek and those that are poor. The thirty-three gods attend
them mayest thou, (O cattle), guide us to the heavenly world!  
17. To the bright world of heaven thou shalt lead us; (there) let us be
united with wife and children! I take her hand, may she follow me there;
neither Nirriti (destruction), nor Arâti (grudge), shall gain mastery
over us!  
18. May we get past the evil Grâhi (seizure)! Casting aside darkness do
thou, (O pestle), let thy lovely voice resound; do not, O wooden tool,
when raised, do injury; do not mutilate the grain devoted to the gods!  
19. All-embracing, about to be covered with ghee, enter, (O pot), as a
co-dweller this space!--Take hold of the winnowing-basket, that has been
grown by the rain: the spelt and the chaff it shall sift out!  
20. Three regions are constructed after the pattern of the Brâhmana:
yonder heaven, the earth, and the atmosphere.--Take the (soma-) shoots,
and hold one another, (O man and wife)! They (the shoots) shall swell
(with moisture), and again go back into the winnowing-basket!  
21. Of manifold variegated colours are the animals, one colour hast
thou, (O porridge), when successfully prepared.--Push these (soma-)
Shoots upon this red skin; the press-stone shall purify them as the
washer-man his clothes!  
22. Thee, the (pot of) earth, I place upon the earth: your substance is
the same, though thine, (O pot), is modified. Even though a blow has
cracked or scratched thee, do not therefore burst: with this verse do I
cover that up!  
23. Gently as a mother embrace the son: I unite thee, (pot of) earth,
with the earth! Mayest thou, the hollow pot, not totter upon the altar,
when thou art pressed by the tools of sacrifice and the ghee!  
24. May Agni who cooks thee protect thee on the east, Indra with the
Maruts protect thee on the south! May Varuna on the west support thee
upon thy foundation, may Soma on the north hold thee together!  
25. Purified by the purifiers, the (waters) flow pure from the clouds,
they reach to the spaces of heaven, and of the earth. They are alive,
refresh the livino, and are firmly rooted: may Agni heat them, after
they have been poured into the vessel!  
26. From heaven they come, into the earth they penetrate; from the earth
they penetrate into the atmosphere. May they, now pure, yet purify
themselves further; may they conduct us to the heavenly world!  
27. Whether ye are over-abundant or just sufficient, ye are surely
clear, pure, and immortal: cook, ye waters, instructed by the husband
and wife, obliging and helpful, the porridge!  
28. Counted drops penetrate into the earth, commensurate with the
breaths of life and the plants. The uncounted golden (drops), that are
poured into (the porridge), have, (themselves) pure, established
complete purity.  
29. The boiling waters rise and sputter, cast up foam and many bubbles.
Unite, ye waters, with this grain, as a woman who beholds her husband in
the proper season!  
30. Stir up (the grains) as they settle at the bottom: let them mingle
their inmost parts with the waters! The water here I have measured with
cups; measured was the grain, so as to be according to these
regulations.  
31. Hand over the sickle, with haste bring promptly (the grass for the
barhis); without giving pain let them cut the plants at the joints! They
whose kingdom Soma rules, the plants, shall not harbour anger against
us!  
32. Strew a new barhis for the porridge: pleasing to its heart, and
lovely to its sight it shall be! Upon it the gods together with the
goddesses shall enter; settle down to this (porridge) in proper order,
and eat it!  
33. O (instrument of) wood, settle down upon the strewn barhis, in
keeping with the divinities and the agnishloma rites! Well shaped, as if
by a carpenter (Tvashtar) with his axe, is thy form. Longing for this
(porridge) the (gods) shall be seen about the vessel!  
34. In sixty autumns the treasurer (of the porridge) shall fetch it, by
the cooked grain he shall obtain heaven; the parents and the children
shall live upon it. Bring thou this (man) to heaven, into the presence
of Agni!  
35. (Thyself) a holder, (O pot), hold on to the foundation of the earth:
thee, that art immoveable the gods (alone) shall move! Man and wife,
alive, with living children, shall remove thee from the hearth of the
fire!  
36. Thou hast conquered and reached all worlds; as many as are our
wishes, thou hast satisfied them. Dip ye in, stirring stick and spoon!
Place it (the por idge) upon a single dish!  
37. Lay (ghee) upon it, let it spread forth, anoint this dish with ghee!
As the lowing cow her young that craves the breast, ye gods shall greet
with sounds of satisfaction this (porridge)!  
38. With ghee thou hast covered it, hast made this place (for the
porridge): may it, peerless, spread afar to heaven! Upon it shall rest
the mighty eagle; gods shall offer it to the divinities!  
39. Whatever the wife cooks aside from thee, (O husband), or the husband
(cooks) unbeknown of thee, O wife, mix that together: to both of you it
shall belong; bring it together into a single place!  
40. As many of her children as dwell upon the earth, and the sons that
have been begotten by him, all those ye shall call up to the dish: on
shall come the young knowing their nest!  
41. The goodly streams, swelling with honey, mixed with ghee, the seats
of ambrosia, all these does he obtain, ascends to heaven. In sixty
autumns the treasurer (of the porridge) shall fetch it!  
42. The treasurer shall fetch this treasure: all outsiders round about
shall not control it! The heaven-directed porridge, that has been
presented and deposited by us, in three divisions has reached the thrte
heavens.  
43. May Agni burn the ungodly Rakshas; the flesh-devouring Pisâka shall
have nothing here to partake of! We drive him away, hold him afar from
us: the Âdityas and Angiras shall stay near it!  
44. To the Âdityas and the Angiras do I offer this (food of) honey,
mixed with ghee. Do ye two, (man and wife), with clean hands, without
having injured a Brâhmana, performing pious deeds, go to that heavenly
world!  
45. I would obtain this highest part of it (the porridge), the place
from which the highest lord permeates (the all). Pour butter upon it,
anoint it witb plentiful ghee: this here is our share, fit for the
Angiras!  
46. For the sake of truth and holy strength do we make over this
porridge as a hoarded treasure to the gods: it shall not be lost to us
in gaming or in the assembly; do not let it go to any other person
before me!  
47. I cook, and I give (to the Brahmans), and so, too, my wife, at my
religious rite and practice.--With the birth of a son the world of
children has arisen (for you): do ye two hold on to a life that extends
beyond (your years)!  
48. In that place exists no guilt, and no duplicity, not even if he goes
conspiring with his friends. This full dish of ours has here been
deposited: the cooked (porridge) shall come back again to him that cooks
it!  
49. kind deeds we shall perform for our friends: all that hate us shall
go to darkness (hell)!--As (fruitful) cow, and (strong) steer, they (man
and wife) shall during, every successive period of their lives drive
away man-besetting death!  
50. The fires (all) know one another, that which lives in plants, and
lives in the waters, and all the (light-) gods that glow upon the
heaven. The gold (here) becomes the light of him that cooks (the
porridge).  
51. This (naked skin) among the hides is born upon man (alone), all
other animals are riot naked. Clothe yourselves, (ye Brahmans), in
sheltering garments: (even) the face of the porridge is a homespun
garment!  
52. What falsehood thou shalt speak at play and in the assembly, or the
falsehood that thou shalt speak through lust for gain--put on together,
(O man and wife), this same garment, deposit upon it every blemish!  
53. Produce rain, go to the gods, let smoke arise from (thy) surface;
all-embracing, about to be covered with ghee, enter as a co-dweller this
place!  
54. In many ways heaven assumes within itself a different form,
according to circumstances. It (the heaven) has laid aside its black
form, purifying itself to a bright (form); the red form do I sacrifice
fot thee into the fire.  
55. Thee here we hand over to the eastern direction, to Agni as
sovereign lord, to the black serpent as guardian, to Âditya as bowman:
do ye guard it for us, until we arrive! To the goal here he shall lead
us, to old age; old age shall hand us over to death: then shall we be
united with the cooked (porridge)!  
56. Thee here we hand over to the southern direction, to Indra as
sovereign lord, to the serpent that is striped across as guardian, to
Yama as bowman: do ye guard it for us, until we arrive! To the goal
here, &c.  
57. Thee here we hand over to the western direction, to Varuna as
sovereign lord, to the pridâku-serpent as guardian, to food as bowman:
do ye guard it for us, until we arrive. To the goal here, &c.  
58. Thee here we hand over to the northern direction, to Soma as
sovereign lord, to the svaga-serpent as guardian, to the lightning as
bowman: do ye guard it for us, until we arrive. To the goal here, &c.  
59. Thee here we hand over to the direction of the nadir, to Vishnu as
sovereign lord, to the serpent with black-spotted neck as guardian, to
the plants as bowmen: do ye guard it for us, until we arrive. To the
goal here, &c.  
60. Thee here we hand over to the direction of the zenith, to Brihaspati
as sovereign lord, to the light-coloured serpent as guardian, to the
rain as bowman: do ye guard it for us, until we arrive. To the goal
here, &c.
