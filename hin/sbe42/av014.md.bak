## VI, 44. Charm against excessive discharges from the body.

1\. The heavens have stood still, the earth has stood still, all
creatures have stood still. The trees that sleep erect have stood still:
may this disease of thine stand still!  
2. Of the hundred remedies which thou hast, of the thousand that have
been collected, this is the most excellent cure for discharges, the best
remover of disease.  
3. Thou art the urine of Rudra, the navel of amrita (ambrosia). Thy
name, forsooth, is vishânakâ, (thou art) arisen from the foundation of
the Fathers, a remover of diseases produced by the winds (of the body).
