## XII, 4. The necessity of giving away sterile cows to the Brahmans.

1\. 'I give,' he shall surely say,'the sterile cow to the begging
Brahmans'--and they have noted her--that brings progeny and offspring!  
2. With his offspring does he trade, of his cattle is he deprived, that
refuses to give the cow of the gods to the begging descendants of the
Rishis.  
3. Through (the gift of) a cow with broken horns his (cattle) breaks
down, through a lame one he tumbles into a pit, through a mutilated one
his house is burned, through a one-eyed one his property is given
away.  
4. Flow of blood attacks the cattle-owner from the spot where her dung
is deposited: this understanding there is about the vasâ (the sterile
cow); for thou (sterile cow) art said to be very difficult to deceive!  
5. From the resting-place of her feet the (disease) called viklindu
overtakes (the owner, or the cattle). Without sickness breaks down (the
cattle) which she sniffs upon with her nose.  
6. He that pierces her ears is estranged from the gods. He thinks: 'I am
making a mark (upon her),' (but) he diminishes his own property.  
7. If any one for whatsoever purpose cuts her tail then do his colts
die, and the wolf tears his calves.  
8. If a crow has injured her hair, as long as she is with her owner then
do his children die: decline overtakes them without (noticeable)
sickness.  
9. If the serving-maid sweeps together her dung, that bites as lye,
there arises from this sin disfigurement that passeth not away.  
10. The sterile cow in her very birth is born for the gods and
Brâhmanas. Hence to the Brahmans she is to be given: that, they say,
guarantees the security of one's own property.  
11. For those that come requesting her the cow has been created by the
gods. Oppression of Brahmans it is called, if he keeps her for
himself.  
12. He that refuses to give the cow of the gods to the descendants of
the Rishis who ask for it, infringes upon the gods, and the wrath of the
Brâhmanas.  
13. Though he derives benefit from this sterile cow, another (cow) then
shall he seek! When kept she injures (his) folk, if he refuses to give
her after she has been asked for!  
14. The sterile cow is as a treasure deposited for die Brâhmanas: they
come here for her, with whomsoever she is born.  
15. The Brâhmanas come here for their own, when they come for the
sterile cow. The refusal of her is, as though he were oppressing them in
other concerns.  
I& If she herds up to her third year, and no disease is discovered in
her, and he finds her to be a sterile cow, O Nârada, then must he look
for the Brâhmanas.  
17. If he denies that she is sterile, a treasure deposited for the gods,
then Bhava and Sarva, both, come upon him, and hurl their arrow upon
him.  
18. Though he does not perceive upon her either udder, or tits, yet both
yield him milk, if he has prevailed upon himself to give away the
sterile cow.  
19. Hard to cheat, she oppresses him, if, when asked for, he refuses to
give her. His desires are not fulfilled, if he aims to accomplish them
without giving her away.  
20. The gods did ask for the sterile cow, making the Brâhmana their
mouthpiece. The man that does not give (her) enters into the wrath of
all of these.  
21. Into the wrath of the cattle enters he that gives not the sterile
cow to the Brâhmanas; if he, the mortal, appropriates the share
deposited for the gods.  
22. Even if a hundred other Brâhmanas beg the owner for the sterile cow,
yet the gods did say anent her: 'The cow belongs to him that knoweth
thus.'  
23. He that refuses the sterile cow to him that knoweth thus, and gives
her to others, difficult to dwell upon is for him the earth with her
divinities.  
24. The gods did beg the sterile cow of him wilh whom she was born at
first. That very one Nârada recognised and drove forth in company with
the gods.  
25. The sterile cow renders childless, and poor in cattle, him that yet
appropriates her, when she has been begged for by the Brâhmanas.  
26. For Agni and Soma, for Kâma, for Mitra, and for Varuna, for these do
the Brâhmanas beg her: upon these he infringes, if he gl ves her not.  
27. As long as the owner does not himself hear the stanzas referring to
(the giving away of) her, she may herd among his cattle; (only) if he
has not heard (them) may she pass the night in his house.  
28. He that has listened to the stanzas, yet has permitted her to herd
among the cattle, his life and prosperity the angry gods destroy.  
29. The sterile cow, even when she rambles freely, is a treasure
deposited for the gods. Make evident thy true nature when thou desirest
to go to thy (proper) stable!  
30. She makes evident her nature when she desires to go to her (proper)
stable. Then indeed the sterile cow puts it into the minds of the
Brahmans to beg (for her).  
31. She evolves it in her mind, that (thought) reaches the gods. Then do
the Brahmans come to beg for the sterile cow.  
32. The call svadhâ befriends him with the Fathers, the sacrifice with
the gods. Through the gift of the sterile cow the man of royal caste
incurs not the anger of (her), his mother.  
33. The sterile cow is the mother of the man of royal caste: thus was it
from the beginning. It is said to be no (real) deprivation if she is
given to the Brahmans.  
34. As if he were to rob the ghee ladled up for Agni (the fire) from the
(very) spoon, thus, if he gives not the sterile cow to the Brahmans,
does he infringe upon Agni.  
35. The sterile cow has the purodasa (sacrificial cake) for her calf,
she yields plentiful milk, helps in this world, and fulfils all wishes
for him that gives her (to the Brahmans).  
36. The sterile cow fulfils all wishes in the kingdom of Yama for him
that gives her. But they say that hell falls to the lot of him that
withholds her, when she has been begged for.  
37. The sterile cow, even if she should become fruitful, lives in anger
at her owner: 'since he did regard me as sterile (without giving me to
the Brahmans), he shall be bound in the fetters of death!'  
38, He who thinks that the cow is sterile, and (yet) roasts her at home,
even his children qnd grandchildren Brihaspati causes to be importuned
(for her).  
39. Fiercely does the (supposed) sterile cow burn when she herds with
the cattle, though she be a (fruitful) cow. She verily, too, milks
poison for the owner that does not present her.  
40. It pleases the cattle when she is given to the Brahmans; moreover,
the sterile cow is pleased, when she is made an offering to the gods
(Brahmans).  
41. From the sterile cows which the gods, returning from the sacrifice,
created, Nârada picked out as (most) terrible the viliptî.  
42. In reference to her the gods reflected: 'Is she a sterile cow, or
not?' And Nârada in reference to her said: 'Of sterile cows she is the
most sterile!'  
43. 'How many sterile cows (are there), O Nârada, which thou knowest to
be born among men?' About these do I ask thee, that knowest: 'Of which
may the non-Brâhmana not eat?'  
44. Of the viliptî, of her that has born a sterile cow, and of the
sterile cow (herself), the non-Brâhmana, that hopes for prosperity,
shall not eat!  
45. Reverence be to thee, O Nârada, that knowest thoroughly which
sterile cow is the most terrible, by withholding which (from the
Brahmans) destruction is.incurred.  
46. The viliptî, O Brihaspati, her that has, begotten a sterile cow, and
the sterile cow (herself), the non-Brâhmana, that hopes for prosperity,
shall not eat!  
47. Three kinds, forsooth, of sterile cows are there: the viliptî, she
that has begotten a sterile cow, and the sterile cow (herself). These he
shall give to the Brahmans; (then) does he not estrange himself from
Pragâpati.  
48. 'This is your oblation, O Brâhmanas,' thus shall he reflect, if he
is supplicated, if they ask him for the sterile cow, terrible in the
house of him that refuses to give her.  
49. The gods animadverted in reference to Bheda and the sterile cow,
angry because he had not given her, in these verses-and therefore he
(Bheda) perished.  
50. Bheda did not present the sterile cow, though requested by Indra:
for this sin the gods crushed him in battle.  
51. The counsellors that advise the withholding (of the sterile cow),
they, the rogues, in their folly, conflict with the wrath of Indra.  
52. They who lead the owner of cattle aside, then say to him: 'do not
give,' in their folly they run into the missile hurled by Rudra.  
53. And if he roasts the sterile cow at home, whether he makes a
sacrifice of her, or not, he sins against the gods and Brâhmanas, and as
a cheat falls from heaven.
