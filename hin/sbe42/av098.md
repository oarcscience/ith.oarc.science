## III, 6. The asvattha-tree as a destroyer of enemies.

1\. A male has sprung from a male, the asvattha (ficus religiosa) from
the khadira (acacia catechu). May this slay my enemies, those whom I
hate and those who hate me!  
2. Crush the enemies, as they rush on, O asvattha, 'displacer,' allied
with Indra, the slayer of Vritra, (allied) with Mitra and Varuxa!  
3. As thou didst break forth, O asvattha, into the great flood (of the
air), thus do thou break up all those whom I hate and those who hate
me!  
4. Thou that goest conquering as a conquering bull, with thee here, O
asvattha, may we conquer our rivals!  
5. May Nirriti (the goddess of destruction), O asvattha, bind in the
toils of death that cannot be loosened those enemies of mine whom I hate
and who hate me!  
6. As thou climbest up the trees, O asvattha, and renderest them
subordinate, thus do thou split in two the head of iny enemy, and
overcome him!  
7. They (the enemies) shall float down like a ship cut loose from its
moorings! There is no returning again for those that have been driven
out by the 'displacer.'  
8. I drive them out with my mind, drive them out with my thought, and
also with my incantation. We drive them out with a branch of the
asvattha-tree.
