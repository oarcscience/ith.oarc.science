</p>  <h2 align="center">II, 14. Charm against a variety of female demons, conceived as hostile to men, cattle, and home.</h2>  
<p>1. Niss&acirc;l&acirc;, the bold, the greedy demon (?dhishana), and (the female demon) with long-drawn howl, the bloodthirsty; all the daughters of Kanda, the Sad&acirc;nv&acirc;s do we destroy.<br> 2. We drive you out of the stable, out of the axle (of the wagon), and the body of the wagon; we chase you, O ye daughters of Magund&icirc;, from the house.<br> 3. In yonder house below, there the grudging demons (ar&acirc;y&icirc;) shall exist; there ruin shall prevail, and all the witches!<br> 4. May (Rudra), the lord of beings, and Indra. drive forth from here the Sad&acirc;nv&acirc;s; those that am seated on the foundation of the house Indra shall overcome with his thunderbolt!<br> 5. Whether ye belong to (the demons) of inherited disease, whether ye have been dispatched by men, or whether ye have originated from the Dasyus (demon-like aborigines), vanish from here, O ye Sad&acirc;nv&acirc;s!<br> 6. About their dwelling-places I did swiftly course, as if on a race-course. I have won all contests with you: vanish from here, O ye Sad&acirc;nv&acirc;s!</p>
