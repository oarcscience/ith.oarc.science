## III, 23. Charm for obtaining a son (pumsavanam).

1\. That which has caused thee to miscarry do we drive away from thee,
that very thing do we deposit outside of thee, away in a far place.  
2. Into thy womb shall enter a male germ, as an arrow into a quiver! May
a man be born there, a son ten months old!  
3. A male son do thou produce, and after him a male shall be born! Thou
shalt be the mother of sons, of those who are born, and those whom thou
shalt bear!  
4. By the effective seed which bulls put forth do thou obtain a son; be
a fruitful milch-cow!  
5. Pragâpati's (the lord of creatures) work do I perform for thee: may
the germ enter into thy womb! Obtain thou, woman, a son who shall bring
prosperity to thee, and bring thou pi-osperity to him!  
6. The plants whose father was the sky, whose mother the earth, Whose
root the (heavenly) ocean--may those divine herbs aid thee in obtaining
a son!
