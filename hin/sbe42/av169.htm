</p>  <h2 align="center">III, 14. Charm for the prosperity of cattle.</h2>  
<p>1. With a firmly founded stable, with wealth, with well-being, with the name of that which is born on a lucky day do we unite you (O cattle)!<br> 2. May Aryaman unite you, may P&ucirc;shan, Brihaspati, and Indra, the conqueror of booty, unite you! Do ye prosper my possessions!<br> Flocking together without fear, making ordure in this stable, holding honey fit for soma, free from disease, ye shall come hither!<br> 4. Right here come, ye cows, and prosper here like the sak&acirc;-bird! And right here do ye beget (your youn(y)! May ye be in accord with me!<br> 5. May your stable be auspicious to you, prosper ye like the s&acirc;ri-birds and parrots! And right here do ye beget (your young)! With us do we unite you.<br> 6. Attach yourselves, O cows, to me as your possessor; may this stable here cause you to prosper! Upon you, growing numerous, and living, may we, increasing in wealth, alive, attend!</p>
