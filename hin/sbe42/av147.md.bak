## VI, 97. Battle-charm of a king upon the eve of battle.

1\. Superior is the sacrifice, superior Agni, superior Soma, superior
Indra. To the end that I shall be superior to all hostile armies do we
thus, offering the agnihotra, reverently present this oblation!  
2. Hail be, ye wise Mitra and Varuna: with honey swell ye our kingdom
here, (so that it shall) abound in offspring! Drive far to a distance
misfortune, strip off from us sin, even after it has been committed!  
3. With inspiration follow ye this strong hero; cling close, ye friends,
to Indra (the king), who conquers villages, conquers cattle, has the
thunderbolt in his arm, overcomes the host arrayed (against him),
crushing it with might!
