</p>  <h2 align="center">XI, 4. Pr&acirc;na, life or breath, personified as the supreme spirit.</h2>  
<p>1. Reverence to Pr&acirc;na, to whom all this (universe) is subject, who has become the lord of the all, on whom the all is supported!<br> 2. Reverence, O Pr&acirc;na, to thy roaring (wind), reverence, O Pr&acirc;na, to thy thunder, reverence, O Pr&acirc;na, to thy lightning, reverence, O Pr&acirc;na, to thy rain!<br> When Pr&acirc;na calls aloud to the plants with his thunder, they are fecundated, they conceive, and then are produced abundant (plants).<br> 4. When the season has arrived, and Pr&acirc;na calls aloud to the plants, then everything rejoices, whatsoever is upon the earth.<br> 5. When Pr&acirc;na has watered the great earth with rain, then the beasts rejoice; (they think): 'strength, forsooth, we shall now obtain.'<br> 6. When they had been watered by Pr&acirc;na, the plants spake in concert: 'thou hast, forsooth, prolonged our life, thou hast made us all fragrant.'<br> 7. Reverence be, O Pr&acirc;na, to thee coming, reverence to thee going; 'reverence to thee standing, and reverence, too, to thee sitting!<br> 8. Reverence be to thee, O Pr&acirc;na, when thou breatbest in (primate), reverence when thou breathest out! Reverence be to thee when thou art turned away, reverence to thee when thou art turned hither: to thee, entire, reverence be here!<br> 9. Of thy dear form, O Pr&acirc;na, of thy very dear form, of the healing power that is thine, give unto us, that we may live!<br> 10. Pr&acirc;na clothes the creatures, as a father his dear son. Pr&acirc;na, truly, is the lord of all, of all that breathes, and does not breathe.<br> 11. Pr&acirc;na is death, Pr&acirc;na is fever. The gods worship Prana. Pr&acirc;na shall place the truth-speaker in the highest world<br> 12. Pr&acirc;na is Vir&acirc;g (power, lustre), Pr&acirc;na is Deshtr&icirc; (the divinity that guides): all worship Pr&acirc;na. Pr&acirc;na verily is sun and moon. They call Pr&acirc;na Prag&acirc;pati.<br> 13. Rice and barley are in-breathing and outbreathing. Pr&acirc;na is called a steer. In-breathing forsooth, is founded upon barley; rice is called out-breathing.<br> 14. Man breathes out and breathes in when within the womb. When thou, O Pr&acirc;na, quickenest him, then is he born again.<br> 15. They call Pr&acirc;na M&acirc;tarisvan (the wind); Pr&acirc;na, forsooth, is called V&acirc;ta (the wind). The past and the future, the all, verily is supported upon Pr&acirc;na.<br> 16. The holy (&acirc;tharvana) plants, the magic (&acirc;ngirasa) plants, the divine plants, and those produced by men, spring forth, when thou, O Pr&acirc;na, quickenest them.<br> 17, When Pr&acirc;na has watered the great earth with rain, then the plants spring forth, and also every sort of herb.<br> 18. Whoever, O Pr&acirc;na, knows this regarding thee, and (knows) on what thou art supported, to him all shall offer tribute in yonder highest world.<br> 19. As all these creatures, O Pr&acirc;na, offer thee tribute, so they shall offer tribute (in yonder world) to him who hears thee, O far-famed one!<br> 20. He moves as an embryo within the gods; having arrived, and being in existence, he is born again. Having arisen he enters with his mights the present and the future, as a father (goes to) his son.<br> 21. When as a swan he rises from the water he does not withdraw his one foot. If in truth he were to withdraw it, there would be neither to-day, nor to-morrow, no night and no day, never would the dawn appear.<br> 22. With eight wheels, and one felloe he moves, containing a thousand sounds (elements), upward in the east, downward in the west. With (his) half he produced the whole world: what is the visible sign of his (other) half?<br> 23. He who rules over this (all) derived from every source, and over everything that movesreverence be to thee, O Pr&acirc;na, that wieldest a swift bow against others (the enemies)!<br> 24. May Pr&acirc;na, who rules over this (all) derived from every source, and over everything that moves, (may he) unwearied, strong through the brahma, adhere to me!<br> 25. Erect he watches in those that sleep, nor does lie lie down across. No one has heard of his sleeping in those that sleep.<br> 26. O Pr&acirc;na, be not turned away from me, thou shalt not be other than myself! As the embryo of the waters (fire), thee, O Pr&acirc;na, do bind to me, that I may live.</p>
