</p>  <h2 align="center">V, 5. Charm with the plant sil&acirc;ki (l&acirc;ksh&acirc;, arundhat&icirc;) for the cure of wounds.</h2>  
<p>1. The night is thy mother, the cloud thy father, Aryaman thy grandfather. Sil&acirc;k&icirc;, forsooth, is thy name, thou art the sister of the gods.<br> 2. He that drinks thee lives; (that) person thou dost preserve. For thou art the supporter of all successive (generations), the refuge of men.<br> 3. Every tree thou dost climb, like a wench lusting after a man. 'Victorious,' 'firmly founded,' 'saving,' verily, is thy name.<br> 4. The wound that has been inflicted by the club, by the arrow, or by fire, of that thou art the cure: do thou cure this person here!<br> 5. Upon the noble plaksha-tree (ficus infectoria) thou growest up, upon the asvattha (ficus religiosa), the khadira (acacia catechu), and the dhava (grislea tomentosa); (thou growest up) upon the noble nyagrodha (ficus indica, banyan-tree), and the parna (butea frondosa). Come thou to us, O arundhat&icirc;!<br> 6. O gold-coloured, lovely, sun-coloured, most handsome (plant), mayest thou come to the fracture, O cure! 'Cure,' verily, is thy name!<br> 7. O gold-coloured, lovely, fiery (plant), with hairy stem, thou art the sister of the waters, O l&acirc;ksh&acirc;, the wind became thy very breath.<br> 8. Sil&acirc;k&icirc; is thy name, O thou that art brown as a goat, thy father is the son of a maiden. With the blood of the brown horse of Yama thou hast verily been sprinkled.<br> 9. Having dropped from the blood of the horse she ran upon the trees, turning into a winged brook. Do thou come to us, O arundhat&icirc;!</p>
