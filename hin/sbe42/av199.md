# PRAYERS AND IMPRECATIONS IN THE INTEREST OF THE BRAHMANS.

## V, 18. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.

1\. The gods, O king, did not give to thee this (Cow) to eat. Do not, O
prince, seek to devour the cow of the Brâhmana, which is unfit to be
eaten!  
2. The prince, beguiled by dice, the wretched one who has lost as a
stake his own person, he may, perchance, eat the cow of the Brâhmana,
(thinking), 'let me live to-day (if) not to-morrow'!  
3. Enveloped (is she) in her skin, as an adder with evil poison; do not,
O prince, (eat the cow) of the Brâhmana: sapless, unfit to be eaten, is
that cow!  
4. Away does (the Brâhmana) take regal power, destroys vigour; like fire
which has caught does he burn away everything. He that regards the
Brâhmana as fit food drinks of the poison of the taimâta-serpent.  
5. He who thinks him (the Brahman) mild, and slays him, he who reviles
the gods, lusts after wealth, without thought, in his heart Indra
kindles a fire; him both heaven and earth hate while he lives.  
6. The Brâhmana must not be encroached upon, any more than fire, by him
that regards his own body! For Soma is his (the Brâhmana's) heir, Indra
protects him from hostile plots.  
7. He swallows her (the cow), bristling with a hundred hooks, (but) is
unable to digest her, he, the fool who, devouring the food of the
Brahmans, thinks, 'I am eating a luscious (morsel).'  
8. (The Brahman's) tongue turns into a bow. string, his voice into the
neck of an arrow; his windpipe, his teeth are bedaubed with holy fire:
with these the Brahman strikes those who revile the gods, by means of
bows that have the strength to reach the heart, discharged by the
gods.  
9. The Brâhmanas have sharp arrows, are armed with missiles, the arrow
whi ch they hurl goes not in vain; pursuing him with their holy fire and
their wrath, even from afar, do they pierce him.  
10. They who ruled over a thousand, and were themselves ten hundred, the
Vaitahavya, when they devoured the cow of the Brâhmana, perished.  
11. The cow herself, when slaughtered, came down upon the Vaitahavyas.
who had roasted for themselves the last she-goat of Kesaraprâbandhâ.  
12. The one hundred and one persons whom the earth did cast off, because
they had injured the offspring of a Brâhmana, were ruined
irretrievably.  
13. As a reviler of the gods does he live among mortals, having
swallowed poison, he becomes more bone (than flesh). He that injureth a
Brâhmana, whose kin are the gods, does not reach heaven by the road of
the Fathers.  
14. Agni is called our guide, Soma our heir, Indra slays those who curse
(us): that the strong (sages) know.  
15. Like a poisoned arrow, O king, like -an adder, O lord of cattle, is
the terrible arrow of the Brâhmana: with that he smites those who revile
(the gods).
