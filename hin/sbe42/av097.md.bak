## II, 7. Charm against curses and hostile plots, undertaken with a certain plant.

1\. The god-begotten plant, hated by the wicked, which wipes away the
curses (of the enemies), like water a foul spot it has washed away all
curses from me.  
2. The curse of the rival and the curse of the kinswoman, the curse
which the Brahman shall utter in wrath, all that (do thou put) under our
feet!  
3. From heaven her root is suspended, from the earth it rises up; with
her that has a thousand shoots do thou protect us on all sides!  
4. Protect me, protect my offspring, protect our goods; let not ill-will
overcome us, let not hostile schemes overcome us!  
5. The curse shall go to the curser; joint possession shall we have with
the friend. Of the enemy who bewitches with (his) eye we hew off the
ribs.
