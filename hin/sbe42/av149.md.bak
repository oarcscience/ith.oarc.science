## XI, 9. Prayer to Arbudi and Nyarbudi for help in battle.

1\. The arms, the arrows, and the might of the bows; the swords, the
axes, the weapons, and the artful scheme that is in our mind; all that,
O Arbudi, do thou make the enemies see, and spectres also make them
see!  
2. Arise, and arm yourselves; friends are ye, O divine folk! May our
friends be perceived and protected by you, O Arbudi (and Nyarbudi)!  
3. Arise (ye two), and take hold! With fetters and shackles surround ye
the armies of the enemy, O Arbudi (and Nyarbudi)!  
4. The god whose name is Arbudi, and the lord Nyarbudi, by whom the
atmosphere and this great earth has been infolded, with these two
companions of Indra do I pursue the conquered (king) with my army.  
5. Arise, thou divine person, O Arbudi, together with thy army! Crushing
the army of tlie enemy, encompass them with thy embraces!  
6. Thou, Arbudi, makest appear the sevenfold spectral brood. Do thou,
when the oblation has been poured, rise up with all. these, together
with the army!  
7. (The female mourner), beating herself, with tear-stained face, with
short (mutilated?) ears, with dishevelled hair, shall lament, when a man
has been slain, pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  
8. She curves her spine while longing in her heart for her son, her
husband, and her kin, when (a man) has been pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  
9. The aliklavas and the gâshkamadas, the vultures, the strong-winged
hawks, the crows, and the birds (of prey) shall obtain their fill! Let
them make evident to the enemy, when (a man) has been pierced by thee, O
Arbudi!  
10. Then, too, every wild beast, insect, and worm shall obtain his fill
on the human carcass, when (a man) has been pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  
11. Seize ye, and tear out in-breathing and outbreathing, O Nyarbudi
(and Arbudi): deep-sounding groans shall arise! Let them make it evident
to the enemy, when (a man) has been pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  
12. Scare them forth, let them tremble; bewilder the enemies with
fright! With thy broad embrace, with the clasp of thy arms crush the
enemies, O Nyarbudi!  
13. May their arms, and the artful scheme that is in their mind be
confused! Not a thing shall remain of them, pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  
14. May (the mourning women) beating them selves, run together, smiting
their breasts and their thighs, not anointed, with dishevelled hair,
howling, when a man has been slain, has been pierced by thee, O
Arbudi!  
15. The dog-like Apsaras, and also the Rûpakâs (phantoms), the plucking
sprite, that eacerly licks within the vessel, and her that seeks out
what has been carelessly hidden, all those do thou, O Arbudi, make the
enemies see, and spectres also make them see!  
16. (And also make them see) her that strides upon the mist, the
mutilated one, who dwells with the mutilated; the vapoury spooks that
are hidden, and the Gandharvas and Apsaras, the serpents, and other
brood, and the Rakshas!  
17. (And also) the spooks with fourfold teeth, black teeth, testicles
like a pot, bloody faces, who are inherently frightful, and
terrifying!  
18. Frighten thou, O Arbudi, yonder lines of the enemy; the conquering
and the victorious (Arbudi and Nyarbudi), the two comrades of Indra,
shall conquer the enemies!  
19. Dissolved, crushed, slain the enemy shall lie, O Nyarbudi! May
victorious sprites, with fiery tongues and smoky crests, go with (our)
army!  
20. Of the enemies repulsed by this (army), O Arbudi, Indra, the spouse
of Saki, shall slay each picked man: not a single one of those yonder
shall escape!  
21. May their hearts burst, may their life's breath escape upward! May
dryness of the mouth overtake (our) enemies, but not (our) allies!  
22. Those who are bold and those who are cowardly, those who turn (in
flight) and those who are deaf (to danger?), those who are (like) dark
goats, and those, too, who bleat like goats, all those, do thou, O
Arbudi, make the enemies see, and spectres also make them see!  
23. Arbudi and Trishamdhi shall pierce our enemies, so that, O Indra,
slayer of Vritra, spouse of Sakî, we may slay the enemy by thousands!  
24. The trees, and (growths) that are like trees, the plants and the
herbs as well, the Gandharvas and the Apsaras, the serpents, gods, pious
men, and (departed) Fathers, all those, O Arbudi, do thou make the
enemies see, and spectres also make them see!  
25. The Maruts, god Âditya, Brahmanaspati did rule over you; Indra, and
Agni, Dhâtar, Mitra, and Pragâpati did rule over you; the seers did rule
over you. Let them make evident to the enemies when (a man) has been
pierced by thee, O Arbudi!  
26. Ruling over all these, rise ye and arm yourselves! Ye divine folk
are (our) friends: win ye the battle, and disperse to your various
abodes!
