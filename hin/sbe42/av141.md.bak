Agni, the Brâhmana, and Surya (shall be ours)! May the lovely goddess
that bore Indra come to us, endowed with lustre!

the waters, cattle, and men (shall be ours)! May the lovely goddess that
bore Indra come to us, endowed with lustre!  
3. (The brilliancy) that is in the chariot, the dice, in the strenath of
the bull; in the wind, Parganya, and in the fire of Varuna (shall be
ours)! May the lovely goddess that bore Indra come to us, endowed with
lustre!  
4. (The brilliancy) that is in the man of royal caste, in the stretched
drum, in the strength of the horge, in the shout of men (shall be ours)!
