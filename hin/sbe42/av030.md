## VI, 57. Urine (gâlâsha) as a cure for scrofulous sores.

1\. This, verily, is a remedy, this is the remedy of Rudra, with which
one may charm away the arrow that has one shaft and a hundred points!  
2. With gâlâsha (urine) do ye wash (the tumour), with gâlâsha do ye
sprinkle it! The gâlâsha is a potent remedy: do thou (Rudra) with it
show mercy to us, that we may live!  
3. Both well-being and comfort shall be ours, and nothing whatever shall
injure us! To the ground the disease (shall fall): may every remedy be
ours, may all remedies be ours!
