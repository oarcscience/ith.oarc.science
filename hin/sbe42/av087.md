## VII, 65. Charm with the apâmârga-plant, against curses, and the consequences of sinful deeds.

1\. With fruit turned backward thou verily didst grow, O apâmârga: do
thou drive all curses quite far away from here!  
2. The evil deeds and foul, or the sinful acts which we have committed,
with thee, O apâmârga, whose face is turned to every side, do we wipe
them out (apa mrigmahe).  
3. If we have sat together with one who has black teeth, or diseased
nails, or one who is deformed, with thee, O apâmârga, we wipe all that
out (apa mrigmahe).
