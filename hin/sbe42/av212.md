## IX, 2. Prayer to Kâma (love), personified as a primordial power.

1\. To the bull that slays the enemy, to Kâma, do I render tribute with
ghee, oblation, and (sacrificial) melted butter. Do thou, since thou
hast been extolled, hurl down my enemies by thy great might!  
2. The evil dream which is offensive to my mind and eye, which harasses
and does not please me, that (dream) do I let loose upon my enemy.
Having praised Kâma may I prevail!  
3,. Evil dreams, O Kâma, and misfortune, O Kâma, childlessness,
ill-health, and trouble, do thou, a strong lord, let loose upon him that
designs evil against us!  
4. Drive them away, O Kâma, thrust them away, O Kâma; may they that are
my enemies fall into trouble! When they have been driven into the
nethermost darkness, do thou, O Agni, burn up their d welling- places!  
5. That milch-cow, O Kâma, whom the sages call Vâk Virâg (ruling, or
resplendent speech), is said to be thy daughter; by her drive away my
enemies; breath, cattle, and life shall give them a wide birth!  
6. With the strength of Kâma, Indra, king Varuna, and Vishnu, with the
impelling force (savena) of Savitar, with the priestly power of Agni, do
I drive forth the enemies, as a skilled steersman a boat.  
7. My sturdy guardian, strong Kâma, shall procure for me full freedom
from enmity! May the gods collectively be my refuge, may all the gods
respond to this, my invocation!  
8. Taking pleasure in this (sacrificial) melted butter, and ghee do ye,
(O gods), of whom Kâma is the highest, be joyful in this place,
procuring for me full freedom from enmity!  
9. O Indra and Agni, and Kâma, having formed an alliance, do ye hurl
down my enemies; when they have fallen into the nethermost darkness, do
thou, O Agni, burn up after them their dwelling places!  
10. Slay thou, O Kâma, those that are my enemies, hurl them down into
blind darkness. Devoid of vigour, Without sap let them all be; they
shall not live a single day!  
11. Kâma has slain those that are my enemies, a broad space has he
furnished me to thrive in. May the four directions of space bow down to
me, and the six broad (regions) carry ghee to me!  
12. They (the enemies) shall float down like a boat cut loose from its
moorings! There is no returning again for those who have been struck by
our missiles.  
13. Agni is a defence, Indra a defence, Soma a defence. May the gods,
who by their defence ward off (the enemy), ward him off!  
14. With his men reduced, driven out, the hated (enemy) shall go,
shunned by his own friends! And down upon the earth do the lightnings
alight; may the strong god crush your enemies!  
15. This mighty lightning supports both moveable and immoveable things,
as well as all thunders. May the rising sun by his resources and his
majesty hurl down my enemies, lie the mighty one!  
16. With that triple-armoured powerful covering of thine, O Kâma, with
the charm that has been made into an Invulnerate armour spread (over
thee), with that do thou drive away those who are my enemies; may
breath, cattle, and life give them a wide berth!  
17. With the weapon with which the god drove forth the Asuras, with
which Indra led the Dasyus to the nethermost darkness, with that do
thou, O Kâma, drive forth far away from this world those who are my
enemies!  
18. As the gods drove forth the Asuras, as Indra. forced the demons into
the nethermost darkness, thus do thou, O Kâma, drive forth far away from
this world those who are my enemies!  
19. Kâma was born at first; him neither the gods, nor the Fathers, nor
men have equalled. To these art thou superior, and ever great; to thee,
O Kâma, do I verily offer reverence.  
20. As great as are the heavens and earth in extent, as far as the
waters have swept, as far as fire; to these art thou superior, &c.  
21. Great as are the directions (of space) and the intermediate
direction on either side, great as are the regions and the vistas of the
sky; to these art thou superior, &c.  
22. As many bees, bats, kurûru-worms, as many vaghas and tree-serpents
as there are; to these art thou superior, &c.  
23. Superior art thou to all that winks (lives), superior to all that
stands still (is not alive), superior to the ocean art thou, O Kâma,
Manyu! To these art thou superior, &c.  
24. Not, surely, does the wind equal Kâma, not the fire, not the sun,
and not the moon. To these art thou superior, &c.  
25. With those auspicious and gracious forms of thine, O Kâma, through
which what thou wilst becometh reaL with these do thou enter into us,
and elsewhere send the evil thoughts!
