# III

# IMPRECATIONS AGAINST DEMONS, SORCERERS, AND ENEMIES (ÂBHIKÂRIKÂNI AND KRITYÂPRATIHARANÂNI).

## I, 7. Against sorcerers and demons.

1\. The sorcerer (yâtudhâna) that vaunts himsel and the Kimîdin do thou,
O Agni, convey hither! For thou, O god, when lauded, becomest the
destroyer of the demon.  
2. Partake of the ghee, of the sesame-oil, O Agni Gâtavedas, that
standest on high, conquerest by thyself! Make the sorcerers howl!  
3. The sorcerers and the devouring (atrin) Kimîdin shall howl! Do ye,
moreover, O Agni and Indra, receive graciously this our oblation!  
4. Agni shall be the first to seize them, Indra with his (strong) arms
shall drive them away! Every wizard, as soon as he comes, shall proclaim
himself, saying, 'I am he'!  
5. We would see thy might, O Gâtavedas; disclose to us the wizards, O
thou that beholdest men! May they all, driven forth by thy fire,
disclosing themselves, come to this spot!  
6. Seize hold, O Gâtavedas: for our good thou wast born! Become our
messenger, O Agni, and make the sorcerers howl!  
7. Do thou, O Agni, drag hither the sorcerers, bound in shackles; then
Indra with his thunderbolt shall cut off their heads!
