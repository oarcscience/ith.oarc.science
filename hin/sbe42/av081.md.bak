## II, 14. Charm against a variety of female demons, conceived as hostile to men, cattle, and home.

1\. Nissâlâ, the bold, the greedy demon (?dhishana), and (the female
demon) with long-drawn howl, the bloodthirsty; all the daughters of
Kanda, the Sadânvâs do we destroy.  
2. We drive you out of the stable, out of the axle (of the wagon), and
the body of the wagon; we chase you, O ye daughters of Magundî, from the
house.  
3. In yonder house below, there the grudging demons (arâyî) shall exist;
there ruin shall prevail, and all the witches!  
4. May (Rudra), the lord of beings, and Indra. drive forth from here the
Sadânvâs; those that am seated on the foundation of the house Indra
shall overcome with his thunderbolt!  
5. Whether ye belong to (the demons) of inherited disease, whether ye
have been dispatched by men, or whether ye have originated from the
Dasyus (demon-like aborigines), vanish from here, O ye Sadânvâs!  
6. About their dwelling-places I did swiftly course, as if on a
race-course. I have won all contests with you: vanish from here, O ye
Sadânvâs!
