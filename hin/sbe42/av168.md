## II, 26. Charm for the prosperity of cattle.

1\. Hither shall come the cattle which have strayed to a distance, whose
companionship Vâyu (the wind) enjoys! (The cattle) whose structure of
form Tvashtar knows, Savitar shall hold in place in this stable!  
2. To this stable the cattle shall flow together, Brihaspati skilfully
shall conduct them hither! Sînîvâlî shall conduct hither their van: do
thou, O Anumati, hold them in place after they have arrived!  
3. May the cattle, may the horses, and may the domestics flow together;
may the increase of the grain flow together! I sacrifice with an
oblation that causeth to flow together!  
4. I pour together the milk of the cows, I pour together strength and
sap with the ghee. Poured together shall be our heroes, constant shall
be the cows with me the owner of the cows!  
5. I bring hither the milk of the cows, I have brought hither the sap of
the grain. Brought hither are our heroes, brought hither to this house
are our wives.
