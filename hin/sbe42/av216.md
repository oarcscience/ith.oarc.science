## IX, 1. Hymn to the honey-lash of the Asvins.

1\. From heaven, from earth, from the atmosphere, from the sea, from the
fire, and from the wind, the honey-lash hath verily sprung. This,
clothed in amrita (ambrosia), all the creatures revering, acclaim in
their hearts.  
2. Great sap of all forms (colours) it hath-they call thee moreover the
seed of the ocean. Where the honey-lash comes bestowing gifts, there
life's breath, and there immortality has settled down.  
3. Men severally, contemplating it profoundly, behold its action upon
the earth: from the fire and from the wind the honey-lash hath verily
sprung, the strong child of the Maruts.  
4. Mother of the Âdityas, daughter of the Vasus, breath of life of
created beings, nave of immortality, the honey-lash, golden-coloured,
dripping ghee, as a great embryo, moves among mortals.  
5. The god's begot the lash of honey, from it came an embryo having all
forms (colours). This, as soon as born, (while yet) young its mother
nourishes; this, as soon as born, surveys all the worlds.  
6. Who knows it and who perceives it, the inexhaustible, soma-holding
cup that has come from the heart of it (the honey-lash)? 'Tis the wise
priest: he shall derive inspiration from it!  
7. He knows them, and he perceives them, the inexhaustible breasts of it
(the honey-lash), that yield a thousand streams. Nourishment they pour
out -without recalcitration.  
8. The great (cow) that loudly gives forth the sound 'him,' that bestows
strength, and goes with loud shouts to the holy act, bellowing with lust
for the three (male) gharmas (fires), she lows, and drips with (streams)
of milk.  
9. When the waters, the mighty bulls, self-sovereign, wait upon (the
cow), swollen with milk, (then) they, the waters, pour nourishment (upon
her), and cause her to pour nourishment at will for him that knoweth
this.  
10. The thunder is thy voice, O Pragâpati; as a bull thou hurlest thy
fire upon the earth. From the fire, and from the wind the honey-lash
hath verily sprung, the strong child of the Maruts.  
11. As the soma at the morn ing-pressure is dear to the Asvins, thus in
my own person, O Asvins, lustre shall be sustained!  
12. As the soma at the second (mid-day) pressure is dear to Indra and
Agni, thus in my own person, O Indra, and Agni, lustre shall be
sustained!  
13. As the soma at the third pressure (evening) is dear to the Ribhus,
thus in my own person, O Ribhus, lustre shall be sustained!  
14. May I beget honey for myself; may I obtain honey for myself!
Bringing milk, O Agni, I have come:. endow me with lustre!  
15. Endow me, O Agni, with lustre, endow me with offspring and with
life! May the gods take note of this (prayer) of mine; may Indra
together with the Rishis (take note of it)!  
16. As bees carry together honey upon honey, thus in my own person, O
Asvins, lustre shall be sustained!  
17. As the bees pile this honey upon honey, thus in my own person, O
Asvins, lustre, brilliance, strength, and force shall be sustained!  
18. The honey that is in the mountains, in the heights; in the cows, and
in the horses; the honey which is in the surâ (brandy) as it is being
poured out, that shall be in me!  
19. O Asvins, lords of brightness, anoint me with the honey of the bee,
that I may speak forceful speech among men!  
20. The thunder is thy speech, O Pragâpati; as a bull thou hurlest thy
fire upon earth and heaven. All animals live upon it (the earth), and
she with it (Pragâpati's fire) fills nourishment and food.  
21. The earth is the staff, the atmosphere the embryo, the heaven the
whip (itself?), the lightning the whip-cord; of gold is the tip (of the
whip?).  
22. He that knoweth the seven honies of the whip becomes rich in honey;
(to wit), the Brâhmana, the king, the cow, the ox, rice, barley, and
honey as the seventh.  
23. Rich in honey becomes he, rich in honey become his appurtenances,
worlds rich in honey does he win, he that knoweth thus.  
24. When in a bright sky it thunders, then Pragâpati manifests himself
to (his) creatures (pragâh). Therefore do I stand with the sacred cord
suspended from the right shoulder (prâkinopavita), saying, 'O Pragâpati,
watch over me!' The creatures (pragâh) watch over him, Pragâpati watches
over him, that knoweth thus.
