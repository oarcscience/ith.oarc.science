## III, 4. Prayer at the election of a king.

1\. (Thy) kingdom hath come to thee: arise, endowed with lustre! Go
forth as the lord of the people, rule (shine) thou, a universal ruler!
All the regions of the compass shall call thee, O king; attended and
revered be thou here!  
2. Thee the clans, thee these regions, goddesses five, shall choose for
empire! Root thyself upon the height, the pinnacle of royalty: then do
thou, mighty, distribute goods among us!  
3. Thy kinsmen with calls shall come to thee; agile Agni shall go with
them as messenger! Thy wives, thy sons shall be devoted to thee; being a
mighty (ruler) thou shalt behold rich tribute!  
4. The Asvins first, Mitra and Varuna both, all the gods, and the
Maruts, shall call thee! Then fix thy mind upon the bestowal of wealth,
then do thou, mighty, distribute wealth among us!  
5. Hither hasten forth from the farthest distance heaven and earth,
both, shall be propitious to thee! Thus did this king Varuna (as if,
'the chooser') decree that; he himself did call thee: 'come thou
hither'!  
6. O Indra, Indra, come thou to the tribes of men, for thou hast agreed,
concordant with the Varunas (as if,'the electors'), He did call thee to
thy own domain (thinking): 'let him revere the gods, and manage, too,
the people'!  
7. The rich divinities of the roads, of manifold diverse forms, all
coming together have given thee a broad domain. They shall all
concordantly call thee; rule here, a mighty, benevolent (king), to up
the tenth decade (of thy life)!
