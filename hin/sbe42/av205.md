## IX, 3. Removal of a house that has been presented to a priest as sacrificial reward.

1\. The fastenings of the buttresses, the supports, and also of the
connectinc, beams of the house, that abounds in treasures, do we
loosen.  
2. O (house) rich in all treasures! the fetter which has been bound
about thee, and the knot which has been fastened upon thee, that with my
charm do I undo, as Brihaspati (undid) Vala.  
3. (The builder) has drawn thee to,,ether, pressed thee together, placed
firm knots upon thee. Skilfully, as the priest who butchers (the
sacrificial animal), do we with Indra's aid disjoint thy limbs.  
4. From thy beams, thy bolts, thy frame, and thy thatch; from thy sides,
(O house) abounding in treasures, do we loosen the fastenings.  
5. The fastenings of the dove-tailed (joints), of the reed (-covering),
of the frame-work, do we loosen here from the 'mistress of dwelling.'  
6. The ropes which they have tied within thee for comfort, these do we
loosen from thee; be thou propitious to our persons, O mistress of
dwelling, after thou hast (again) been erected!  
7. A receptacle for Soma, a house for Agni, a seat for the mistresses
(of the house), a seat (for the priests), a seat for the gods art thou,
O goddess house!  
8. Thy covering of wicker-work, with thousand eyes, stretched out upon
thy crown, fastened down and laid on, do we loosen with (this) charm.  
9. He who receives thee as a gift, O house, and he by whom thou hast
been built, both these, O mistress of dwelling, shall live attaining old
age!  
10. Return to him in the other world, firmly bound, ornamented, (thou
house), which we loosen limb by limb, and joint by joint!  
11. He who built thee, O house, brought together (thy) timbers, he, a
Pragâpati on high, did construct thee, O house, for his progeny
(pragâyai).  
12. We render obeisance to him (the builder); obeisance to the giver,
the lord of the house; obeisance to Agni who serves (the sacrifice); and
obeisance to thy (attendant) man!  
13. Reverence to the cattle and the horses, and to that which is born in
the house! Thou that hast produced, art rich in offspring, thy fetters
do we loosen.  
14. Thou dost shelter Agni within, (and) the domestics together with the
cattle. Thou that hast produced, art rich in offspring, thy fetters do
we loosen.  
15. The expanse which is between heaven and earth, with that do I
receive as a gift this house of thine; the middle region which is
stretched out from the sky, that do I make into a receptacle for
treasures; with that do I receive the house for this one.  
16. Full of nurture, full of milk, fixed upon the earth, erected,
holding food for all, O house, do thou not injure them that receive thee
as a gift!  
17. Enveloped in grass, clothed in reeds, like night does the house
lodge the cattle; erected thou dost stand upon the earth, like a
she-elephant, firm of foot.  
18. The part of thee that was covered with mats unfolding do I loosen.
Thee that hast been enfolded by Varuna may Mitra uncover in the
morning!  
19. The house built with pious word, built by seers, erected--may Indra
and Agni, the two immortals, protect the house, the seat of Soma!  
20. Chest is crowded upon chest, basket upon basket; there mortal man is
begotten from whom all things spring.  
21. In the house which is built with two facades, four facades, six
facades; in the house with eight facades, with ten facades, in the
'mistress of dwelling.' Agni rests as if in the womb.  
Tuirning towards thee that art turned towards me, O house, I come to
thee that injurest me not. For Agni and the waters, the first door to
divine order, are within.  
23. These waters, free from disease, destructive of disease, do I bring
here. The chambers do I enter in upon in company with the immortal Agni
(fire).  
24. Do thou not fasten a fetter upon us; though a heavy load, become
thou light! As a bride do we carry thee, O house, wherever we please.  
25. From the easterly direction of the house reverence (be) to
greatness, hail to the gods who are to be addressed with hail!  
26. From the southerly direction of the house, &c.!  
27. From the westerly direction of the house, &c.!  
28. From the northerly direction of the house, &c.!  
29. From the firm direction (nadir) of the house, &c.!  
30. From the upright direction (zenith) of the house, &c.!  
3 1. From every direction of the house reverence (be) to greatness, hail
to the gods who are to be addressed with hail!
