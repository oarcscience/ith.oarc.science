## XX, 127. A kuntâpa-hymn.

### A.

1\. Listen, ye folks, to this: (a song) in praise of a hero shall be
sung! Six thousand and ninety (cows) did we get (when we were) with
Kaurama among the Rusamas,--  
2. Whose twice ten buffaloes move right along, touether with their cows;
the height of his chariot just misses the heaven which recedes from its
touch.  
3. This one (Kaurama) presented the seer with a hundred jewels, ten
chaplets, three hundred steeds, and ten thousand cattle.

### B.

4\. Disport thyself, O chanter, disport thyself as a bird upon a
flowering tree; thy tongue glides quickly over the lips as a razor over
the strop.  
5. The chanters with their pious song hurry on blithely as cows; at home
are their children, and at home the cows do they attend.  
6. Bring hither, O chanter, thy poem, that which earns cattle and earns
good things! Among the gods (kings) place thy voice as a manly archer
his arrow!

### C.

7\. Listen ye to the high praise of the king who rules over all peoples,
the god who is above mortals, of Vaisvânara Parikshit!  
8. 'Parikshit has procured for us a secure dwelling when he, the most
excellent one, weat to his seat.' (Thus) the husband in Kuru-land, when
he founds his household, converses with his wife.  
9. 'What may I bring to thee, curds, stirred drink, or liquor?' (Thus) I
the wife asks her husband in the kingdom of king Parikshit.  
10. Like light the ripe barley runs over beyond the mouth (of the
vessels). The people thrive merrily in the kingdom of king Parikshit.

### D.

11\. Indra has awakened the poet, saying: 'Arise, move about, and sing;
of me, the strong, verily, sing the praises; full every pious one shall
offer thee (sacrificial reward)!'  
12. Here, O cattle, ye shall be born, here, ye horses, here, ye
domestics! And Pûshan also, who bestows a thousand (cows) as sacrificial
reward, settles down here.  
13. May these cattle, O Indra, not suffer harm, and may their owner not
suffer harm; may the hostile folk, O Indra, may the thief not gain
possession of them!  
14. We shout to the hero with hymn and song we (shout) with a pleasing
song. Take delight in our songs; may we not ever suffer harm!
