## IV, 7. Charm against poison.

1\. This water (vâr) in the (river) Varanâvatî shall ward off
(vârayâtai)! Amrita (ambrosia) has been poured into it: with that do I
ward off (vâraye) poison from thee.  
2. Powerless is the poison from the east, powerless that from the north.
Moreover the poison from the south transforms itself into a porridge.  
3. Having made thee (the poison) that comes from a horizontal direction
into a porridge, rich in fat, and cheering, from sheer hunger he has
eaten thee, that hast an evil body: do thou not cause injury!  
4. Thy bewildering quality (madam), O (plant?) that art bewildering
(madivati), we cause to fall like a reed. As a boiling pot of porridge
do we remove thee by (our) charm.  
5. (Thee, O poison) that art, as it were, heaped about the village, do
we cause to stand still by (our) charm. Stand still as a tree upon its
place; do not, thou that hast been dug with the spade, cause injury!  
6. With broom-straw (?), garments, and also with skins they purchased
thee: a thing for barter art thou, O plant! Do not, thou that hast been
dug with the spade, cause injury!  
7. Those of you who were of yore unequalled in the deeds which they
performed-may the), not injure here our men: for this very purpose do I
engage you!
