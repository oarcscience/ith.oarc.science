## II, 30. Charm to secure the love of a woman.

1\. As the wind tears this grass from the surface of the earth, thus do
I tear thy soul, so that thou, woman, shalt love, shalt not be averse to
me!  
2. If ye, O two Asvins, shall unite and bring together the loving
pair-united are the fortunes of,both of you (lovers), united the
thoughts, united the purposes!  
3. When birds desire to chirp, lustily desire to chirp, may my call go
there, as an arrow-point upon the shaft!  
4. What is within shall be without, what is without shall be within!
Take captive, O herb, the, soul of the maidens endowed with every
chai-m!  
5. Longing for a husband this woman hath come, I have come longing for a
wife, As a loudly neighing horFe I have attained to my good fortune!
