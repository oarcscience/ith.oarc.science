## VII, 45. Charm to allay jealousy.

1\. From folk belonging to all kinds of people, from the Sindhu (Indus)
thou hast been brought hither: from a distance, I ween, has been fetched
the very remedy for jealousy.  
2. As if a fire is burning him, as if the forest-fire burns in various
directions, this jealousy of his do thou quench, as a fire (is quenched)
with water!
