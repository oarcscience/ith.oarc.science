## III, 1. Battle-charm for confusing the enemy.

1\. Agni shall skilfully march against our opponents, burning against
their schemes and hostile plans; Gâtavedas shall confuse the army of our
opponents and deprive them (of the use) of their hands!  
2. Ye Maruts are mighty in such matters: advance ye, crush ye, conquer
ye (the enerny)! These Vasus when implored did crush (them). Agni, vily,
as their vanauard shall skilfully attack!  
3. O Maghavan, the hostile army which contends against us--do ye, O
Indra, Vritra's slayer, and Agni, burn against them!  
4. Thy thunderbolt, O Indra, who hast been driven forward swiftly by thy
two bay steeds, shall advance, crushing the enemies. Slay them that
resist, pursue, or flee, deprive their schemes of fulfilment!  
5. O Indra, confuse the army of the enemy; with the impact of the fire
and the wind scatter them to either side!  
6. Indra shall confuse the army, the Miaruts shall slay it with might!
Agni shall rob it of its sight; vanquished it shall turn about!
