## III, 2. Battle-charm for confusing the enemy.

1\. Agni, our skilful vanguard, shall attack, burning, against their
schemes and hostile plans! Gâtavedas shall bewilder the plans of the
enemy, and deprive them (of the use) of their hands!  
2. This fire has confused the schemes that are in your mind; it shall
blow you from your home, blow you away from everywhere!  
3. O Indra, bewildering their schemes, come hither with thy (own) plan:
with the impact of the fire and the wind scatter them to either side!  
4. O ye plans of theirs, fly ye away; O ye schemes, be ye confused!
Moreover, what now is in their mind, do thou drive that out of them!  
5. Do thou, O (goddess) Apvi, confusing their plans, go forth (to them),
and seize their limbs! Attack them, burn with flames into their hearts;
strike the enemy with fits, (strike our) opponents with darkness!  
6. That army yonder o( the enemy, that comes against us fighting with
might, do ye, O Maruts, strike with planless darkness, that one of them
shall not know the other!
