## VI, 92. Charm to endow a horse with swiftness.

1\. Swift as the wind be thou, O steed, when joined (to the chariot); at
Indra's urging go, fleet as the mind! The Maruts, the all-possessing,
shall harness thee,Tvashtar shall put fleetness into thy feet!  
2. With the fleetness, O runner, that has been deposited in thee in a
secret place, (with the fleetness) that has been made over to the eagle,
the wind, and moves in them, with that, O steed, strong with strength,
do thou win the. race, reaching the goal in the contest!  
3. Thy body, O steed, leading (our) body, shall run, a pleasure to
ourselves, delight to thyself! A god, not stumbling, for the support of
the great, he shall, as if upon the heaven, found his own light!
