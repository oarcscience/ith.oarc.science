</p>  <h2 align="center">VII, 76. A. Charm for curing scrofulous sores called apakit.</h2>  
<p>1. Ye (sores) fall easily from that which falls easily, ye exist less than those that do not exist (at all); ye are drier than the (part of the body called) sehu, more moist than salt.<br> 2. The apakit (sores) that are upon the neck, and those that are upon the shoulders; the apakit that are upon the vig&acirc;man (some part of the body) fall off of themselves.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">B. Charm for curing tumours called g&acirc;y&acirc;nya.</h3>  
<p>3. The g&acirc;y&acirc;nya that crushes the ribs, that which passes down to the sole of the foot, and whichever is fixed upon the crown of the head, I have driven out every one.<br> 4. The g&acirc;y&acirc;nya, winged, flies; he settles down upon man. Here is the remedy both for sores not caused by cutting as well as for wounds sharply cut!<br> 5. We know, O g&acirc;y&acirc;nya, thy origin, whence thou didst spring. How canst thou slay there, in whose house we offer oblations?</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">C. Stanza sung at the mid-day pressure of the soma.</h3>  
<p>6. Drink stoutly, O Indra, slayer of Vritra, hero, of the soma in the cup, at the battle for riches! Drink thy fill at the mid-day pressure! Living in wealth, do thou bestow wealth upon us!</p>
