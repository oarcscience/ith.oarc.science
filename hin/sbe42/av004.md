## I, 25. Charm against takman (fever).

1\. When Agni, having entered the waters, burned, where the (gods) who
uphold the order (of the universe) rendered homage (to Agni), there,
they say, is thy origin on high: do thou feel for us, and spare us, O
takman!  
2. Whether thou art flame, whether thou art heat, or whether from
licking chips (of wood) thou bast arisen, Hrûdu by name art thou, O god
of the yellow: do thou feel for us, and spare us, O takman!  
3. Whether thou art burning, whether thou art scorching, or whether thou
art the son of king Varuna, Hrûdu by name art thou, O god of the yellow:
do thou feel for us, and spare us, O takman!  
4. To the cold takman, and to the deliriously hot, the glowing, do I
render homage. To hirn that returns on the morrow, to him that returns
for two (successive) days, to the takman that returns on the third day,
homage shall be!
