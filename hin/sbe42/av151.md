## V, 20. Hymn to the battle-drum.

1\. High sounds the voice of the drum, that acts the warrior, the wooden
(drum), equipped with the skin of the cow. Whetting thy voice, subduing
the enemy, like a lion sure of victory, do thou loudly thunder against
them!  
2. The wooden (instrument) with fastened (covering) has thundered as a
lion, as a bull roars to the cow that longs to mate. Thou art a bull,
thy enemies are eunuchs; thou ownest Indra's foesubduing fire!  
3. Like a bull in the herd, full of might, lusty, do thou, O snatcher of
booty, roar against them! Pierce with fire the heart of the enemy; with
-broken ranks the foe shall run and scatter!  
4. In victorious battles raise thy roar! What may be captured, capture;
sound in many places! Favour, O drum, (our deeds) with thy divine voice;
bring to (us) with strength the property of the enemy!  
5. When the wife of the enemy hears the voice of the drum, that speaks
to a far distance, may she, aroused by the sound, distressed, snatch her
son to her arms, and run, frightened at the clash of arms!  
6. Do thou, O drum, sound the first sound, ring brilliantly over the
back of the earth! Open wide thy maw at the enemies host; resound
brightly, joyously, O drum!  
7. Between this heaven and earth thy noise shall spread, thy sounds
shall quickly part to every side! Shout thou and thunder with swelling
sound; make music at thy friend's victory, having, (chosen) the good
side!  
8. Manipulated with care, its voice shall resound! Make bristle forth
the weapons of the warriors! Allied to Indra do thou call hither the
warriors; with thy friends beat vigorously down the enemies!  
9. A shouting herald, followed by a bold army, spreading news in many
places, sounding through the village, eager for success, knowing the
way, do thou distribute glory to many in the battle!  
10. Desiring advantage, gaining booty, full mighty, thou hast been made
keen by (my) song, and winnest battles. As the press-stone on the
gathering skin dances upon the soma-sboots, thus do thou, O drum,
lustily dance upon the booty!  
11. A conqueror of enemies, overwhelming, foe-subduing, eager for the
fray, victoriously crushing, as a speaker his speech do thou carry forth
thy sound; sound forth here strength for victory in battle!  
12. Shaking those that are unshaken, hurrying to the strife, a conqueror
of enemies, an unconquerable leader, protected by Indra, attending to
the hosts, do thou that crusheth the hearts of the enemies, quickly go!
