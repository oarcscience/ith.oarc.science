## XI, 5. Glorification of the sun, or the primeval principle, as a Brahman disciple.

1\. The Brahmakârin (Brahmanical disciple) moves inciting both
hemispheres of the world; in him the gods are harmonised. He holds the
heavens and the earth, he fills the teacher with creative fervour
(tapas).  
2. The fathers, the divine folk, and all the gods severally follow the
Brahmakârin; the Gandharvas did go after him, six thousand three hundred
and thirty-three. He fills all the gods with creative fervour.  
3. When the teacher receives the Brahmakârin as a disciple, he places
him as a foetus inside (of his body). He carries him for three nights in
his belly: when he is born the gods gather about to see him.  
4. This earth is (his first) piece of firewood, the heaven the second,
and the atmosphere also he fills with (the third) piece of firewood. The
Brahmakârin. fills the worlds with his firewood, his girdle, his
asceticism, and his creative fervour.  
5. Prior to the brahma (spiritual exaltation) the Brahmakârin was born;
clothed in heat, by creative fervour he arose. From him sprung the
brâhmanam (Brahmanic life) and the highest brahma, and all the gods
together with immortality (amrita).  
6. The Brahmakârin advances, kindled by the firewood, clothed in the
skin of the black antelope, consecrated, with long beard. Within the day
he passes from the eastern to the northern sea; gathering together the
worlds he repeatedly shapes them.  
7. The Brahmakârin, begetting the brahma, the waters, the world,
Pragâpati Parameshthin (he that stands in the hiahest place), and Virâg,
having become an embryo in the womb of immortality, having forsooth,
become Indra, pierced the Asuras.  
8. The teacher fashioned these two hern spheres of the world, the broad
and the deep, earth and heaven. These the Brahmakârin guards with his
creative fervour (tapas): in him the gods are harmonised.  
9. This broad earth and the heaven the Brahmakârin first brought hither
as alms. Having made these into two sticks of firewood he reveres them
upon them all beings have been founded.  
10. One is on the hither side, the other on the farther side of the back
of the heavens; secretly are deposited the two receptacles of the
brâhmanam (Brahmanic life). These the Brahmakârin protects by his tapas
(creative fervour); understandingly he performs that brahma (spiritual
exaltation) solely.  
11. One on the hither side, the other away from the earth, do the two
Agnis come together between these two hemispheres (of the world). To
them adhere the rays firmly; the Brahmakârin by his tapas (creative
fervour) enters into the (rays).  
12. Shouting forth, thundering, red, white he carries a great penis
along the earth. The Brahmakârin sprinkles seed upon the back of the
earth; through it the four directions live.  
13. Into fire, the sun, the moon, Mâtarisvan (wind), and the waters, the
Brahmakârin places the firewood; the lights from these severally go into
the clouds, from them come sacrificial butter, the purusha (primeval
man), rain, and water.  
14. Death is the teacher, (and) Varuna, Soma, the plants, milk; the
clouds were the warriors: by these this light has been brought hither.  
15. Varuna, having become the teacher, at home prepares the ghee solely.
Whatever he desired from Pragâpati, that the Brahmakârin furnished, as
Mitra (a friend) from his own Atman (spirit, or person).  
16. The Brahmakârin is the teacher, the Brahmakârin Pragâpati. Pragâpati
rules (shines forth, vi râgati); Virâg (heavenly power, or light) became
Indra, the ruler.  
17. Through holy disciplehood. (brahmakâryam), through tapas (creative
fervour), the king protects his kingdom. The teacher by (his own)
brahmakâryam (holy life) seeks (finds) the Brahmakârin.  
18. Through holy disciplehood the maiden obtains a young husband,
through holy disciplehood the steer, the horse seeks to obtain fodder.  
19. Through holy disciplehood, through creative fervour, the gods drove
away death. Indrajorsooth, by his holy disciplehood brought the light to
the gods.  
20. The plants, that which was and shall be, day and night, the tree,
the year along with the seasons, have sprung from the Brahmakârin.  
21. The earthly and the heavenly animals, the wild and the domestic, the
wingless and the winged (animals), have sprung from the Brahmakârin.  
22. All the creatures of Pragâpati (the creator) severally carry breath
in their souls. All these the brahma, which has been brought hither in
the Brahmakârin, protects.  
23. This, that was set into motion by the gods, that is insurmountable,
that moves shining, from it has sprung the brâhmanam (Brahmanical life),
the highest brahma, and all the gods, together with immortality
(amrita).  
24, 25. The Brahmakârin carries the shining brahma: into this all the
gods are woven. Producing in-breathing and out-breathing, as well as
through-breathing; speech, mind, heart, brahma, and wisdom, do thou
furnish us with sight, hearing, glory, food, semen, blood, and belly!  
26. These things the Brahmakârin fashioned upon the back of the
(heavenly) water. He stood in the sea kindled with tapas (creative
fervour). He, when he has bathed, shines vigorously upon the earth,
brown and ruddy.
