## V, 7. Prayer to appease Arâti, the demon of grudge and avarice.

1\. Bring (wealth) to us, do not stand in our way, O Arâti; do not keep
from us the sacrificial reward as it is being taken (to us)! Adoration
be to the power of grudge, the power of failure, adoration to Arâti!  
2. To thy advising minister, whom thou, Arâti, didst make thy agent, do
we make obeisance. Do not bring failure to my wish!  
3. May our wish, instilled by the gods, be fulfilled by day and night!
We go in quest of Arâti. Adoration be to Arâti!  
4. Sarasvatî (speech), Anumati (favour), and Bhaga (fortune) we go to
invoke. Pleasant, honied, words I have spoken on the occasions when the
gods were invoked.  
5. Him whom I implore with Vâk Sarasvatî (the goddess-of speech), the
yoke-fellow of thought, faith shall find to-day, bestowed by the brown
soma!  
6. Neither our wish nor our speech do thou frustrate! May Indra and Agni
both bring us wealth! Do ye all who to-day desire to make gifts to us
gain favour with Arâti!  
7. Go far away, failure! Thy missile do we avert. I know thee (to be)
oppressive and piercing, O Arâti!  
8. Thou dost even transform thyself into a naked woman, and attach
thyself to people in their sleep, frustrating, O Arâti, the thought, and
intention of man.  
9. To her who, great, and of great dimension, did penetrate all the
regions, to this golden-locked Nirriti (goddess of misfortune), I have
rendered obeisance.  
10. To the gold-complexioned, lovely one, who rests upon golden
cushions, to the great one, to that Arâti who wears golden robes, I have
rendered obeisance.
