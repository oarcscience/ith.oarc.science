## IV, 22. Charm to secure the superiority of a king.

1\. This warrior, O Indra, do thou strengthen for me, do thou install
this one as sole ruler (bull) of the Vis (the people); emasculate all
his enemies, subject them to him in (their) contests!  
2. To him apportion his share of villages, horses, and cattle; deprive
of his share the one that is his enemy! May this king be the pinnacle of
royalty; subject to him, O Indra, every enemy!  
3. May this one be the treasure-lord of riches, may this king be the
tribal lord of the Vis (the people)! Upon this one, O Indra, bestow
great lustre, devoid of lustre render his enemy!  
4. For him shall ye, O heaven and earth, milk ample good, as two
milch-cows yielding warm milk! May this king be favoured of Indra,
favoured of cows, of plants, and cattle!  
5. I unite with thee Indra who has supremacy, through whom one conquers
and is not (himself) conquered, who shall install thee as sole ruler of
the people, and as chief of the human kings.  
6. Superior art thou, inferior are thy rivals, and whatsoever
adversaries are thine, O king! Sole ruler, befriended of Indra,
victorious, bring thou hither the supplies of those who act as thy
enemies!  
7. Presenting the front of a lion do thou devour all (their) people,
presenting the front of a tiger do thou strike down the enemies! Sole
ruler, befriended of Indra, victorious, seize upon the supplies of those
who act as thy enemies!
