## VI, 100. Ants as an antidote against poison.

1\. The gods have given, the sun has given, the earth has given, the
three Sarasvatîs, of one mind, have given this poison-destroying
(remedy)!  
2. That water, O ants, which the gods poured for you into the dry land,
with this (water), sent forth by the gods, do ye destroy this poison!  
3. Thou art the daughter of the Asuras, thou art the sister of the gods.
Sprung from heaven and earth, thou didst render the poison devoid of
strength.
