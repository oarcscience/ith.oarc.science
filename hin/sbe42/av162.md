## VI, 94. Charm to bring about submission to one's will.

1\. Your minds, your purposes, your plans, do we cause to bend. Ye
persons yonder, that are devoted to other purposes, we cause you to
comply!  
2. With my mind do I seize your minds: do ye with your thoughts follow
my thought! I place your hearts in my control: come ye, directing your
way after my course!  
3. I have called upon heaven and earth, I have called upon the goddess
Sarasvatî, I have called upon both Indra and Agni: may we succeed in
this. O Sarasvatî!
