## VI, 43. Charm to appease anger.

1\. This darbha-grass removes the anger of both kinsman and of stranger.
And this remover of wrath, 'appeaser of wrath' it is called.  
2. This darbha-grass of many roots, that reaches down into the ocean,
having risen from the earth, 'appeaser of wrath' it is called.  
3. Away we take the offensiveness that is in thy jaw, away (the
offensiveness) in thy mouth, so that, bereft of will, thou shalt not
speak, shalt come up to my wish!
