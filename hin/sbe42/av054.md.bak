## VI, 32. Charm for driving away demons (Rakshas and Pisâkas).

1\. Do ye well offer within the fire this oblation with ghee, that
destroys the spook! Do thou, O Agni, burn from afar against the Rakshas,
(but) our houses thou shalt not consume!  
2. Rudra has broken your necks, ye Pisâkas: may he also break your ribs,
ye spooks! The plant whose power is everywhere has united you with Yama
(death).  
3. Exempt from danger, O Mitra and Varuna, may we here be; drive back
with your flames the devouring demons (Atrin)! Neither aider, nor
support do they find; smiting one another they go to death.
