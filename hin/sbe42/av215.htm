</p>  <h2 align="center">XI, 7. Apotheosis of the ukkhishta, the leavings of the sacrifice.</h2>  
<p>1. In the ukkhishta are deposited name (quality) and form, in the ukkhishta the world is deposited. Within the ukkhishta Indra and Agni, and the all are deposited.<br> 2. In the ukkhishta heaven and earth, and all beings, are deposited; in the ukkhishta are deposited the waters, the ocean, the moon, and the wind.<br> 3. In the ukkhishta are both being and non-being, death, strength (food), and Prag&acirc;pati. The (creatures) of the world are founded upon the ukkhishta; (also) that which is confined and that which is free, and the grace in me.<br> 4. He who fastens what is firm, the strong, the leader, the brahma, the ten creators of the all, the divinities, are fixed on all sides to the ukkhishta as the (spokes of the) wheel to the nave.<br> 5. Rik, S&acirc;man, and Yagus, the singing of the s&acirc;mans, their introductions, and the stotras are in the ukkhishta. The sound 'him' is in the ukkhishta, and the modulations and the music of the s&acirc;man. That is in me.<br> 6. The prayer to Indra and Agni (aindr&acirc;gnam), the call to the soma, as it is being purified (p&acirc;vam&acirc;mam), the mah&acirc;n&acirc;mn&icirc;-verses, the singing of the mah&acirc;vrata, (these) divisions of the service are in the ukkhishta, as the embryo in the mother.<br> 7. The ceremony of the consecration of the king (r&acirc;gas&ucirc;ya), the v&acirc;gapeya, the agnishtoma, and the cattle-sacrifice belonging to it, the arka and the horse-sacrifice, and the most delightful (sacrifice) for which fresh barhis is strewn, are in the ukkhishta.<br> 8. The preparation of the sacred fire (agny&acirc;dheyam), the consecration for the soma-sacrifice (diksh&acirc;), the sacrifice by which (special) wishes are fulfilled, together with the metres, the sacrifices that have passed out, and the extended sacrifices (satra), are lounded upon the ukkhishta.<br> 9. The agnihotra, faith, the call vashat, vows and asceticism, sacrificial rewards, what is sacrificed (to the gods) and given (to the priests) are contained in the ukkhishta.<br> 10. The (soma-sacrifice) that lasts one night (ekar&acirc;tra), and that which lasts two nights (dvir&acirc;tra), the (condensed soma-sacrifice called) sadyahkr&icirc;, and<br> (that which is called) prakr&icirc;, the (Songs called) ukthya, are woven and deposited in the ukkhishta; (also the parts) of the sacrifice subtle through (higher) knowledge.<br> 11. The soma-sacrifice that lasts four nights (kat&ucirc;r&acirc;tra), five nights (pa&ntilde;kar&acirc;tra), six nights (shadr&acirc;tra), and along (with them) those that last double the time; the sixteenfold stotra (shodasin), and the soma-sacrifice that lasts seven nights (saptar&acirc;tra), all the sacrifices which were founded upon immortality (amrita), were begotten of the ukkhishta.<br> 12. The pratih&acirc;ra-passages (in the s&acirc;man-songs), and their final syllables, the (soma-sacrifices called) visvagit and abhgit, the soma-sacrifice that ends<br> with the day (s&acirc;hna), and that which lasts into the next day (atir&acirc;tra), are in the ukkhishta--the soma-sacrifice also that lasts twelve days. That is in me.<br> 13. Liberality, accomplishment, possession, the call svadh&acirc;, nurture, immortality (amrita), and might, all inner desires are satisfied according to wish in the ukkhishta.<br> 14. The nine earths, oceans, heavens, are founded upon the ukkhishta. The sun shines in the ukkhishta, and day and night also. That is in me.<br> 15. The (soma-sacrifice called) upahavya, the offering on the middle day of a sacrifice lasting a year (vish&ucirc;vant), and the sacrifices that are secretly presented, Ukkhishta, the sustainer of the universe, the father of the generator (Prag&acirc;pati), supports.<br> 16. Ukkhishta, the father of the generator, the grandson of the spirit (asu), the primal ancestor (grandfather), the ruler of the universe, the lusty bull dwells upon the earth.<br> 17. Order (rita), truth (satya), creative fervour (tapas), sovereignty, asceticism, law and works; past, future, strength, and prosperity, are in the ukkhishta-force in force.<br> 18. Success, might, plans, dominion, sovereignty, the six broad (regions), the year, libation (id&acirc;), the orders to the priests (praisha), the draughts of soma (graha), oblations (are founded) upon the ukkhishta.<br> 19. The (liturgies called) katurhot&acirc;rah, the &acirc;pri-hymns, the triennial sacrifices, the (formulas called) n&icirc;vid, the sacrifices, the priestly functions, the cattle-sacrifice and the soma-oblations connected with it, are in the ukkhishta.<br> 20. The half-months and months, the divisions of the year together with the seasons, the resounding waters, thunder, the great Vedic canon (sruti) are in the ukkhishta.<br> 21. Pebbles, sand, stones, herbs, plants, grass, clouds, lightning, rain, are attached to, and are founded upon the ukkhishta.<br> 22. Success, attainment, accomplishment, control, greatness, prosperity, supreme attainment, and wellbeing rest upon, rest in, have been deposited in the ukkhishta.<br> 23. Whatever breathes with breath, and sees with sight, all gods in the heavens, founded upon heaven, were born of the ukkhishta.<br> 24. The riks and the s&acirc;mans, the metres, the ancient legends (pur&acirc;nam) together with the yagus, all gods in the heavens, founded upon heaven, were born of the ukkhishta.<br> 25. In-breathing and out-breathing, sight, hearing, imperishableness and perishableness, all gods in the heavens, founded upon heaven, were born of the ukkhishta.<br> 26. Joys, pleasures, delights, jubilation and merriment, all gods in the heavens, founded upon heaven, were born of the ukkhishta.<br> 27. The gods, the (deceased) Fathers, men, Gandharvas and Apsaras, all gods in the heavens, founded upon heaven, were born of the ukkhishta.</p>
