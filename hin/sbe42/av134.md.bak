## VI, 140. Expiation for the irregular appearance of the first pair of teeth.

1\. Those two teeth, the tigers, that have broken forth, eager to devour
father and mother, do thou, O Brahmanaspati Gâtavedas, render
auspicious!  
2. Do ye eat rice, eat barley, and eat, too, beans, as well as sesamum!
That, O teeth.. is the share deposited for your enrichment. Do not
injure father and mother!  
3. Since ye have been invoked, O teeth, be ye in unison kind and
propitious! Elsewhere, O teeth, shall pass away the fierce (qualities)
of your body! Do not injure father and mother!
