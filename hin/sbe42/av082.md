## III, 9. Against vishkandha and kâbava (hostile demons).

1\. Of karsapha and visapha heaven is the father and earth the mother.
As, ye gods, ye have brought on (the trouble), thus do ye again remove
it!  
2. Without fastening the), (the protecting plants?) held fast, thus it
has been arranged by Manu. The vishkandha do I render impotent, like one
who gelds cattle.  
3. A talisman tied to a reddish thread the active (seers) then do fasten
on: may the fastenings render impotent the eager, fiery kâbava!  
4. And since, O ye eager (demons), ye walk like gods by the wile of the
Asuras, the fastening (of the amulet) is destructive to the kâbava, as
the ape to the dog.  
5. I revile thee, the kâbava, unto misfortune, (and) shall work harm for
thee. Accompanied with curses ye shall go out like swift chariots!  
6. A hundred and one vishkandha are spread out along the earth; for
these at the beginning they brought out thee, the amulet, that destroys
vishkandha.
