## VI, 8. Charm to secure the love of a woman.

1\. As the creeper embraces the tree on all sides, thus do thou embrace
me, so that thou, woman, shalt love me, so that thou shalt not be averse
to me!  
2. As the eagle when he flies forth presses his wings against the earth,
thus do I fasten down thy mind, so that thou, woman, shalt love me, so
that thou shalt not be averse to me.  
3. As the sun day by day goes about this heaven and earth, thus do I go
about thy mind, so that thou, woman, shalt love me, so that thou shalt
not be: averse to me.
