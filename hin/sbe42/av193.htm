</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 120. Prayer for heaven after remission of sins.</h2>  
<p>1. If air, or earth and heaven, if mother or father, we have injured, may this Agni G&acirc;rhapatya (household fire) without fail lead us out from this (crime)<br> to the world of well-doing!<br> 2. The earth is our mother, Aditi (the universe) our kin, the air our protector from hostile schemes. May father sky bring prosperity to us from the world of the Fathers; may I come to my (departed) kin, and not lose heaven!<br> 3. In that bright world where our pious friends live in joy, having cast aside the ailments of their own bodies, free from lameness, not deformed in limb, there may we behold our parents and our children!</p>
