## V, 5. Charm with the plant silâki (lâkshâ, arundhatî) for the cure of wounds.

1\. The night is thy mother, the cloud thy father, Aryaman thy
grandfather. Silâkî, forsooth, is thy name, thou art the sister of the
gods.  
2. He that drinks thee lives; (that) person thou dost preserve. For thou
art the supporter of all successive (generations), the refuge of men.  
3. Every tree thou dost climb, like a wench lusting after a man.
'Victorious,' 'firmly founded,' 'saving,' verily, is thy name.  
4. The wound that has been inflicted by the club, by the arrow, or by
fire, of that thou art the cure: do thou cure this person here!  
5. Upon the noble plaksha-tree (ficus infectoria) thou growest up, upon
the asvattha (ficus religiosa), the khadira (acacia catechu), and the
dhava (grislea tomentosa); (thou growest up) upon the noble nyagrodha
(ficus indica, banyan-tree), and the parna (butea frondosa). Come thou
to us, O arundhatî!  
6. O gold-coloured, lovely, sun-coloured, most handsome (plant), mayest
thou come to the fracture, O cure! 'Cure,' verily, is thy name!  
7. O gold-coloured, lovely, fiery (plant), with hairy stem, thou art the
sister of the waters, O lâkshâ, the wind became thy very breath.  
8. Silâkî is thy name, O thou that art brown as a goat, thy father is
the son of a maiden. With the blood of the brown horse of Yama thou hast
verily been sprinkled.  
9. Having dropped from the blood of the horse she ran upon the trees,
turning into a winged brook. Do thou come to us, O arundhatî!
