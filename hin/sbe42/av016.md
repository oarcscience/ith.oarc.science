## VI, 90. Charm against internal pain (colic), due to the missiles of Rudra.

1\. The arrow that Rudra did cast upon thee, into (thy) limbs, and into
thy heart, this here do we now draw out away from thee.  
2. From the hundred arteries which are distributed along thy limbs, from
all of these do we exorcise forth the poisons.  
3. Adoration be to thee, O Rudra, as thou casteth (thy arrow); adoration
to the (arrow) when it has been placed upon (the bow); adoration to it
as it is being hurled; adoration to it when it has fallen down!
