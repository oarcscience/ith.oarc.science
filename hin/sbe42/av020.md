## VI, 80. An oblation to the sun, conceived as one of the two heavenly dogs, as a cure for paralysis.

1\. Through the air he flies, looking down upon all beings: with the
majesty of the heavenly dog, with that oblation would we pay homage to
thee!  
2. The three kâlakâñga that are fixed upon the sky like gods, all these
I have called for help, to render this person exempt from injury.  
3. In the waters is thy origin, upon the heavens thy home, in the middle
of the sea, and upon the earth thy greatness. With the majesty of the
heavenly dog, with that oblation would we pay homage to thee!
