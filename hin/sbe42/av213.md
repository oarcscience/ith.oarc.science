## XIX, 53. Prayer to Kâla (time), personified as a primordial power.

1\. Time, the steed, runs with seven reins (rays), thousand-eyed,
ageless, rich in seed. The seers, thinking holy thoughts, mount him, all
the beings (worlds) are his wheels.  
2. With seven wheels does this Time ride, seven naves has he,
immortality is his axle. He carries hither all these beings (worlds).
Time, the first god, now hastens onward.  
3. A full jar has been placed upon Time; him, verily, we see existing in
many forms. He carries away all these beings (worlds); they call him
Time in the highest heaven.  
4. He surely did bring hither all the beings (worlds), he surely did
encompass all the beings (worlds). Being their father, he became their
son; there is, verily, no other force, higher than he.  
5. Time begot yonder heaven, Time also (begot) these earths. That which
was, and that which shall be, urged forth by Time, spreads out.  
6. Time created the earth, in Time the sun burns. In Time are all
beings, in Time the eye looks abroad.  
7. In Time mind is fixed, in Time breath (is fixed), in Time names (are
fixed); when Time has arrived all these creatures rejoice.  
8. In Time tapas (creative fervour) is fixed; in Time the highest (being
is fixed); in Time brahma (spiritual exaltation) is fixed; Time is the
lord of everything, he was the father of Pragâpati.  
9. By him this (universe) was urged forth, by him it was begotten, and
upon him this (universe) was founded. Time, truly, having become the
brahma (spiritual exaltation), supports Parameshthin (the highest
lord).  
10. Time created the creatures (pragâh), and Time in the beginning
(created) the lord of creatures (Prâgapati); the self-existing Kasyapa
and the tapas (creative fervour) from Time were born.
