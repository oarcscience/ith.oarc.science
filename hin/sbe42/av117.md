## VI, 9. Charm to secure the love of a woman.

1\. Hanker thou after my body, my feet, hanker after my eyes, my thighs!
The eyes of thee, as thou lustest after me, and thy hair shall be
parched with love?  
2. I make thee cling to my arm, cling to my heart, so that thou shalt be
in my power, shalt come up to my wish!  
3. The cows, the mothers of the ghee, who lick their young, in whose
heart love is planted, shall make yonder woman bestow love upon me!
