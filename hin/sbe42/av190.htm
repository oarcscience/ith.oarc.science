</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 115. Expiatory formulas for sins.</h2>  
<p>1. From the sins which knowingly or unknowingly we have committed, do ye, all gods, of one accord, release us!<br> 2. If awake, or if asleep, to sin inclined, I have committed a sin, may what has been, and what shall be, as if from a wooden post, release me!<br> 3. As one released from a wooden post, as one in a sweat by bathing (is cleansed) of filth, as ghee is clarified by the sieve, may all (the gods) clear me from sin!</p>
