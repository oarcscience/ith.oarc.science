## II, 9. Possession by demons of disease, cured by an amulet of ten kinds of wood.

1\. O (amulet) of ten kinds of wood, release this man from the demon
(rakshas) and the fit (grâhi) which has seized upon.(gagrâha) his
joints! Do thou, moreover, O plant, lead him forth to the world of the
living!  
2. He has come, he has gone forth, he has joined the community of the
living. And he has become the father of sons, and the most happy of
men!  
3. This person has come to his senses, he has come to the cities of the
living. For he (now) has a hundred physicians, and also a thousand
herbs.  
4. The gods have found thy arrangement, (O amulet); the Brahmans,
moreover, the plants. All the gods have found thy arrangement upon the
earth.  
5. (The god) that has caused (disease) shall perform the cure; he is
himself the best physician.  
Let him indeed, the holy one, prepare remedies for thee, together with
the (earthly) physician!
