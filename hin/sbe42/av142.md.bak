## VI, 39. Prayer for glory (yasas).

1\. The oblation that yields glory, sped on by Indra, of thousandfold
strength, well offered, prepared with might, shall prosper! Cause me,
that offers the oblation, to continue long beholding (light), and to
rise to supremacy!  
2. (That he may come) to us, let us honour with obeisance glory-owning
Indra, the glorious one with glory-yielding (oblations)! Do thou (the
oblation) grant us sovereignty sped on by Indra; may we in thy favour be
glorious!  
3. Glorious was Indra born, glorious Agni, glorious Soma. Glorious, of
all beings the most glorious, am I.
