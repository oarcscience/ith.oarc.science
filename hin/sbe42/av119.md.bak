## III, 25. Charm to arouse the passionate love of a woman.

1\. May (love), the disquieter, disquiet thee; do not hold out upon thy
bed! With the terrible arrow of Kâma (love) do I pierce thee in the
heart.  
2. The arrow, winged with longing, barbed with love, whose shaft is
undeviating desire, with that, well-aimed, Kâma shall pierce thee in the
heart!  
3. With that well-aimed arrow of Kâma which parches the spleen, whose
plume flies forward, which burns up, do I pierce thee in the heart.  
4. Consumed by burning ardour, with parched mouth, do thou (woman) come
to me, pliant, (thy) pride laid aside, mine alone, speaking sweetly and
to me devoted!  
5. I drive thee with a goad from thy mother and thy father, so that thou
shalt be in my power, shalt come up to my wish.  
6. All her thoughts do ye, O Mitra and Varuna, drive out of her! Then,
having deprived her of her will,.put her into my power alone!
