</p>  <h2 align="center">II. 32. Charm against worms in cattle.</h2>  
<p>1. The rising sun shall slay the worms, the setting sun with his rays shall slay the worms that are within the cattle!<br> 2. The variegated worm, the four-eyed, the speckled, and the white--I crush his ribs, and I tear off his head.<br> 3. Like Atri, like Kanva, and like Gamadagni do I slay you, ye worms! With the incantation of Agastya do I crush the worms to pieces.<br> 4. Slain is the king of the worms, and their viceroy also is slain. Slain is the worm, with him his mother slain, his brother slain, his sister slain.<br> 5. Slain are they who are inmates with him, slain are his neighbours; moreover all the quite tiny worms are slain.<br> 6. I break off thy two horns with which thou deliverest thy thrusts; I cut that bag of thine which is the receptacle for thy poison.</p>
