## IV, 38. A. Prayer for success in gambling.

1\. The successful, victorious, skilfully gaming Apsarâ, that Apsarâ who
makes the winnings in the game of dice, do I call hither.  
2. The skilfully gaming Apsarâ who sweeps and heaps up (the stakes),
that Apsarâ who takes the winnings in the game of dice, do I call
hither.  
May she, who dances about with the dice, when she takes the stakes from
the game of dice, when she desires to win for us, obtain the advantage
by (her) magic! May she come to us full of abundance! Let them not win
this wealth of ours!  
4. The (Apsarâs) who rejoice in dice, who carry grief and wrath-tbat
joyful and exulting Apsarâ, do I call hither.

### B. Prayer to secure the return of calves that have strayed to a distance.

5\. They (the cattle) who wander along the rays of the sun, or they who
wander along the flood of light) they whose bull (the. sun), full of
strength, from afar protecting, with the day wanders about all the
worlds-may he (the bull), full of strength, delighting in this offering,
come to us touether with the atmosphere!  
6. Together with the atmosphere, O thou who art full of strength,
protect the white (karkî) calf, O thou swift steed (the sun)! Here are
many drops (of ghee) for thee; come hither! May this white calf (karkî)
of thine, may thy mind, be here!  
7. Together with the atmosphere, O thou who art full of strength,
protect the white (karkî) calf, O thou swift steed (the sun)! Here is
the fodder, here the stall, here do we tie down the calf. Whatever (are
your) names, we own you. Hail!
