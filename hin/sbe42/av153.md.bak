# VI.

# CHARMS TO SECURE HARMONY, INFLUENCE IN THE ASSEMBLY, AND THE LIKE (SÂMMANASYÂNI, ETC.).

## III, 30. Charm to secure harmony.

1\. Unity of heart, and unity of mind, freedom from hatred, do I procure
for you. Do ye take delight in one another, as a cow in her (new-) born
calf!  
2. The son shall be devoted to his father, be of the same mind with his
mother; the wife shall speak honied, sweet, words to her husband!  
3. The brother shall not hate the brother, and the sister not the
sister! Harmonious, devoted to the same purpose, speak ye words in
kindly spirit!  
4. That charm which causes the gods not to disagree, and not to hate one
another, that do we prepare in your house, as a means of agreement for
your folk.  
5. Following your leader, of (the same) mind, do ye not hold yourselves
apart! Do ye come here, co-operating, going along the same wagon-pole,
speaking agreeably to one another! I render you of the same aim, of the
same mind.  
6. Identical shall be your drink, in common shall be your share of food!
I yoke you together in the same traces: do ye worship Agni, joining
together, as spokes around about the hub!  
7. I render you of the same aim, of the same mind, all paying deference
to one (person) through my harmonising charm. Like the gods that are
guarding the ambrosia, may he (the leader) be welldisposed towards you,
night and day!
