## VI, 78. Blessing for a married couple.

1\. Through this oblation, that causes prosperity, may this man flourish
anew; may he excel the wife that they have brought to him with his
sap!  
2. May he excel in strength, excel in royalty! May this couple be
inexhaustible in wealth that bestows thousandfold lustre!  
3. Tvashtar begot (for thee) a wife, Tvashtar for her begot thee as a
husband. May Tvashtar bestow upon you two a thousand lives, may he
bestow upon you long life!
