## III, 28. Formula in expiation of the birth of twin-calves.

1\. Through one creation at a time this (cow) was born, when the
fashioners of the beings did create the cows of many colours.
(Therefore), when a cow doth beget twins portentously, growling and
cross she injureth the cattle.  
2. This (cow) doth injure our cattle: a flesh-eater, devourer, she hath
become. Hence to a Brahman he shall give her; in this way she may be
kindly and auspicious!  
3. Auspicious be to (our) men, auspicious to (our) cows and horses,
auspicious to this entire field, auspicious be to us right here!  
4. Here be prosperity, licre be sap! Be thou here one that especially
gives a thousandfold! Make the cattle prosper, thou mother of twins!  
5. Where our pious friends live joyously, having left behind the
ailments of their bodies, to that world the mother of twins did attain:
may she not injure our men and our cattle!  
6. Where is the world of our pious friends, where the world of thern
that sacrifice with the agnihotra, to that world the mother of twins did
attain: may she not injure our imen and our cattle!
