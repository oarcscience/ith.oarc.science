## III, 13. Charm for conducting a river into a new channel.

1\. Because of yore, when the (cloud-) serpent was slain (by Indra), ye
did rush forth and shout (anadatâ), therefore is your name 'shouters'
(nadyah rivers'): that is your designation, ye streams!  
2. Because, when sent forth by Varuna, ye then quickly did bubble up;
then Indra met (âpnot) you, as ye went, therefore anon are ye 'meeters'
(âpah waters')!  
3. When reluctantly ye flowed, Indra, forsooth, did with might choose
(avîvarata) you as his own, ye goddesses! Therefore 'choice' (vâr
'water') has been given you as your name!  
4. One god stood upon you, as ye flowed according to will. Up breathed
(ud ânishuh) they who are known as 'the great' (mahîh). Therefore
'upbreather' (udakam 'water') are they called!  
5. The waters are kindly, the waters in truth were ghee. These waters,
truly, do support Agni and Soma. May the readily flowing, strong sap of
the honey-dripping (waters) come to me, together with life's breath and
lustre!  
6. Then do I see them and also do I hear them; their sound, their voice
doth come to me. When, ye golden-coloured, I have refreshed myself with
you, then I ween, ambrosia (amrita) am I tasting!  
7. Here, ye waters, is your heart, here is your calf, ye righteous ones!
Come ye, mighty ones, by this way here, by which I am conducting you
here!
