## IV, 5. Charm at an assignation.

1\. The bull with a thousand horns who rose out of the sea, with the aid
of him, the mighty one, do we put the folks to sleep.  
2. The wind blows not over the earth. No one looks on. Do thou then,
befriended of Indra, put all women and dogs to sleep!  
3. The women that lie upon couches and upon beds, and they that rest in
litters, the women all that exhale sweet fragrance, do we put to
sleep.  
4. Every moving thing I have held fast. Eye and breath I have held fast.
I have held fast all limbs in the deep gloom of the night.  
5. Of him that sits, and him that walks, of him that stands and looks
about, of these the eyes we do shut, just as these premises (are
shut).  
6. The mother shall sleep, the father shall sleep, the dog shall sleep,
the lord of the house shall sleep! All her relations shall sleep, and
these people round about shall sleep!  
7. O sleep, put thou to sleep all people with the magic that induces
sleep! Put the others to sleep until the sun rises; may I be awake until
the dawn appears, like Indra, unharmed, uninjured!
