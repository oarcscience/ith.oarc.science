## VI, 102. Charm to secure the love of a woman.

1\. As this draught animal, O ye Asvins, comes on, and proceeds, thus
may thy soul come on, and proceed to me!  
2. I draw to myself thy mind, as the leading stallion the female
side-horse. As the stalk of grass torn by the wind, thus shall thy mind
fasten itself upon me!  
3. A coaxing mixture of salve, of sweet wood, of kushtha, and of
spikenard, do I deftly pick out with the hands of Bhaga (good fortune).
