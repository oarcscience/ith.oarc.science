1\. The piercing (arrows) shall not hit us, nor shall the striking
arrows hit us! Far away fron, us O Indra, to either side, cause the
arrow-shower to fall!  
2. To either side of us the arrows shall fall, those that have been shot
and shall be shot! Ye divine and ye human arrows, pierce ye mine
enemies!

bear enmity towards us, those enemies of mine Rudra shall pierce with a
shower of arrows!  
4. Him that rivals us, or does not rival us, him that curses us with
hate, may all the gods injure my charm protects me from within!
