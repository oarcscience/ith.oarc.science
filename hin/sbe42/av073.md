## V. 30. Prayer for exemption from disease and death.

1\. From near thy vicinity, from near thy distance (do I call): remain
here, do not follow; do not follow the Fathers of yore! Firmly do I
fasten thy life's breath.  
2. Whatever sorcery any kinsman or stranger has practised against thee,
both release and deliverance with my voice do I declare for thee.  
3. If thou hast deceived or cursed a woman or a man in thy folly, both
release and deliverance with my voice do I declare for thee.  
4. If thou liest (ill) in consequence of a sin committed by thy mother
or thy father, both release and deliverance with my voice do I declare
for thee.  
5. Fight shy of the medicine which thy mother and thy father, thy sister
and thy brother let out against thee: I shall cause thee to live unto
old age!  
6. Remain here, O man, with thy entire soul; do not follow the two
messengers of Yama: come to the abodes of the living!  
7. Return when called, knowing the outlet of the path (death), the
ascent, the advance, the road of every living man!  
8. Fear not, thou shalt not die: I shall cause thee to live unto old
age! I have charmed away from thy limbs the disease that wastes the
limbs.  
9. The disease that racks and wastes thy limbs, and the sickness in thy
heart, has flown as an eagle to a far distance, overcome by my charm.  
10. The two sages Alert and Watchful, the sleepless and the vigilant,
these two guardians of thy life's breath, are awake both day and
night.  
11. Agni here is to be revered; the sun shall rise here for thee: rise
thou from deep death, yea from black darkness!  
12. Reverence be to Yama, reverence to death; reverence to the Fathers
and to those that lead (to them) \[death's messengers?\]! That Agni who
knows the way to save do I engage for this man, that he be exempt from
harm!  
13. His breath shall come, his soul shall come, his sight shall come,
and, too, his strength! His body shall collect itself: then shall he
stand firm upon his feet!  
14. Unite him, Agni, with breath and sight, provide him with a body and
with strength! Thou hast a knowledge of immortality: let him not now
depart, let him not now become a dweller in a house of clay!  
15. Thy in-breathing shall not cease, thy outbreathing shall not vanish;
Sûrya (the sun), the supreme lord, shall raise thee from death with his
rays!  
16. This tongue (of mine), bound (in the mouth, yet) mobile, speaks
within: with it I have charmed away disease, and the hundred torments of
the takman (fever).  
17. This world is most dear to the gods, unconquered. For whatever death
thou wast destined when thou wast born, O man, that (death) and we call
after thee: do not die before old age!
