## VI, 83. Charm for curing scrofulous sores called apakit.

1\. Fly forth, ye apakit (sores), as an eagle from the nest! Sûrya (the
sun) shall prepare a remedy, Kandramâs (the moon) shall shine you
away!  
2. One is variegated, one is white, one is black, and two are red: I
have gotten the names of all of them. Go ye away without slaying men!  
3. The apakit, the daughter of the black one, without bearing offspring
will fly away; the boil will fly away from here, the galunta (swelling)
will perish.  
4. Consume thy own (proper) oblation with gratification in thy mind,
when I here offer svâhâ in my mind!
