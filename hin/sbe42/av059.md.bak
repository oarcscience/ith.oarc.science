## VI, 127. The kîpudru-tree as a panacea.

1\. Of the abscess, of the balâsa, of flow of blood, O plant; of
neuralgia, O herb, thou shalt not leave even a speck!  
2. Those two boils (testicles) of thine, O balasa, that are fixed upon
the arm-pits-I know the remedy for that: the kîpudru-tree takes care of
it.  
3. The neuralgia that is in the limbs, that is in the ears and in the
eyes-we tear them out, the neuralgia, the abscess, and the pain in the
heart. That unknown disease do we drive away downward.
