## VII, 35. An incantation to make a woman sterile.

1\. The other enemies conquer with might; beat back, O Gâtavedas, those
that are not yet born! Enrich this kingdom unto happiness, may all the
gods acclaim this man!  
2. Of these hundred entrails of thine, as well as of the thousand
canals, of all these have I closed the openings with a stone.  
3. The upper part of the womb do I place below, there shall come to thee
neither offspring nor birth! I render thee sterile and devoid of
offspring; a stone do I make into a cover for thee.
