</p>  <h2 align="center">III, 3. Charm for the restoration of an exiled king.</h2>  
<p>1. (Agni) has shouted loud: may he here well perform his work! Spread thyself out, O Agni, over the far-reaching hemispheres of the world! The all-possessing Maruts shall engage thee: bring hither that (king) who devoutly spends the offering!<br> 2. However far he be, the red (steeds) shall urge hither Indra, the seer, to friendship, since the gods, (chanting) for him the g&acirc;yatri, the brihat&icirc;, and the arka (songs), infused courage into him with the sautr&acirc;man&icirc;-sacrifice!<br> 3. From the waters king Varuna shall call thee, Soma shall call thee from the mountains, Indra shall cite thee to these clans! Turn into an eagle and fly to these clans!<br> 4. An eagle shall bring hither from a distance him that is fit to be called, (yet) wanders exiled in a strange land! The Asvins shall prepare for thee a path, easy to travel! Do ye, his kinfolk, gather close about him!<br> 5. Thy opponents shall call thee; thy friends have chosen. thee! Indra, Agni, and all the gods have kept prosperity with this people.<br> 6. The kinsman or the stranger that opposes thy call, him, O Indra, drive away; then render this (king) accepted here!</p>
