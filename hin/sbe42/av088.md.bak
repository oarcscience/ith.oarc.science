## X, 1. Charm to repel sorceries or spells.

1\. The (spell) which they skilfully prepare, as a bride for the
wedding, the multiform (spell), fashioned by hand, shall go to a
distance: we drive it away!  
2. The (spell) that has been brought forward by the fashioner of the
spell, that is endowed with head, endowed with nose, endowed with ears,
and multiform, shall go to a distance: we drive it away!  
3. (The spell) that has been prepared by a Sadra, prepared by a Râga,
prepared by a woman, prepared by Brahmans, as a wife rejected by her
husband, shall recoil upon her fabricator, (and) his kin!  
4. With this herb have I destroyed all spells, that which they have put
into thy field, into thy cattle, and into thy men.  
5. Evil be to him that prepares evil, the curse shall recoil upon him
that utters curses: back do we hurl it against him, that it may slay him
that fashions the spell.  
6. Pratikîna (' Back-hurler'), the descendant of Angiras, is our
overseer and officiator (purohita): do thou drive back again (pratîkîh)
the spells, and slay yonder fashioners of the spells!  
7. He that has said to thee (the spell): 'go on'! upon that enemy, that
antagonist do thou turn, O spell: do not seek out us, that are
harmless!  
8. He that has fitted together thy joints with skill, as the wagoner
(Ribhu) the joints of a chariot, to him go, there is thy course: this
person here shall remain unknown to thee!  
9. They that have prepared thee and taken hold of thee, the cunning
wizards-this is what cures it, destroys the spell, drives it back the
opposite way - with it do we bathe thee.  
10. Since we have come upon the wretched (spell), as upon (a cow) with a
dead calf, flooded away (by a river), may all evil go away from me, and
mav possessions come to me!  
11. If (thy enemies) have made (offerings) to thy Fathers, or have
called thy name at the sacrifice, may these herbs free thee from every
indigenous evil!  
12. From the sin of the gods, and that of the fathers, from mentions of
(thy) name, from (evil schemes) concocted at home, may the herbs free
thee with might, through (this) charm, (and these) stanzas, (that are)
the milk of the Rishis!  
13. As the wind stirs up the dust from the earth, and the cloud from the
atmosphere, thus may all misfortune, driven by my charm, go away from
me!  
14. Stride away (O spell), like a loudly braying she-ass, that has been
loosened (from the tether); reach those that have fabricated thee,
driven from here by (my) forceful charm!  
15. 'This is the way, O spell,' with these words do we lead thee. Thee
that hast been sent Out against us do we send back again. Go this way
like a crushing army, with heavy carts, thou that art multiform, and
crowned by a crest(?)!  
16. In the distance there is light for thee, hitherward there is no road
for thee; away from us take thy course! By another road cross thou
ninety navigable streams, hard to cross! Do not injure, go away!  
17. As the wind the trees, crush down and fell (the enemy), leave them
neither cow, nor horse, nor serving-man! Turn from here upon those that
have fabricated thee, O spell, awaken them to childlessness!  
18. The spell or the magic which they have buried against thee in the
sacrificial straw (barhis), in the field, (or) in the burial-ground, or
if with superior skill they have practised sorcery against thee, that
art simple and innocent, in thy household fire,--  
19. The hostile, insidious instrument which they have brought hither has
been discovered; that which has been dug in we have detected. It shall
go whence it has been brought hither; there, like a horse, it shall
disport itself, and slay the offspring of him that has fashion'ed the
spell!  
20. Swords of good brass are in our house: we know how many joints thou
hast, O spell! Be sure to rise, go away from hence! O stranger, what
seekest thou here?  
21. I shall hew off, O spell, thy neck, and thy feet: run away! May
Indra and Agni, to whom belong the children (of men), protect us!  
22. King Soma, who guards and pities us, and the lords of the beings
shall take pity on us!  
23. May Bhava and Sarva cast the lightning, the divine missile, upon him
that performs evil, fashions a spell, and does wrong!  
24. If thou art come two-footed, (or) four-footed, prepared by the
fashioner of the spell, multiform, do thou, having become eight-footed,
again go away from here, O misfortune!  
25. Anointed, ornamented, and well equipped, go away, carrying every
misfortune! Know, O spell, thy maker, as a daughter her own father!  
26. Go away, O spell, do not stand still, track (the enemy) as a wounded
(animal)! He is the game, thou the hunter: he is not able to put thee
down.  
27. Him that first hurls (the arrow), the other, laying on in defence,
slays with the arrow, and while the first deals the blow, the other
returns the blow.  
28. Hear, verily, this speech of mine, and then return whence thou
camest, against the one that fashioned thee!  
29. Slaughter of an innocent is heinous, O spell: do not slay our cow,
horse, or serving-man! Wherever thou hast been put down, thence thee do
we remove. Be lighter than a leaf!  
30. If ye are enveloped in darkness, covered as if by a net--we tear all
spells out from here, send them back again to him that fashioned them.  
31. The offspring of them that fashion the spell, practise magic, or
plot against us, crush thou, O spell, leave none of them! Slay those
that fashion the spell!  
32. As the sun is released from darkness, abandons the night, and the
streaks of the dawn, thus every misery, (every) device prepared by the
fashioner of the spell, (every) misfortune, do I leave behind, as an
elephant the dust.
