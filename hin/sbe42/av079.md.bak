## I, 16. Charm with lead, against demons and sorcerers.

1\. Against the devouring demons who, in the night of the full-moon,
have arisen in throngs, may Agni, the strong, the slayer of the
sorcerers, give us courage!  
2. To the lead Varuna gives blessing, to the lead Agni gives help. Indra
gave me the lead: unfailingly it dispels sorcery.  
3. This (lead) overcomes the vishkandha, this smites the devouring
demons (atrin); with this I have overwhelmed all the brood of the
Pisâkas.  
4. If thou slayest our cow, if our horse or our domestic, we pierce thee
with the lead, so that thou shalt not slay our heroes.
