## VI, 91. Barley and water as universal remedies.

1\. This barley they did plough vigorously, with yokes of eight and
yokes of six. With it I drive off to a far distance the ailment from thy
body.  
2. Downward blows the wind, downward burns the sun, downward the cow is
milked: downward shall thy ailment pass!  
3. The waters verily are healing, the waters chase away disease, the
waters cure all (disease): may they prepare a remedy for thee!
