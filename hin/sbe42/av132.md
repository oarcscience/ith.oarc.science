## I, 18. Charm to remove evil bodily characteristics from a woman.

1\. The (foul) mark, the lalâmî (with spot on the forehead), the Arâti
(grudging demon), do we drive out. Then the (signs) that are auspicious
(shall remain) with us; (yet) to beget offspring do we bring the
Arâti!  
2. May Savitar drive out uncouthness from her feet, may Varuna, Mitra,
and Aryaman (drive it) out from her hands; may Anumati kindly drive it
out for us! For happiness the gods have created this woman.  
3. The fierceness that is in thyself, in thy body, or in thy look, all
that do we strike away with our charm. May god Savitar prosper thee!  
4. The goat-footed, the bull-toothed, her who scares the cattle, the
snorting one, the vilîdhî (the driveling one), the lalâmî (with spot on
the forehead), these do we drive from us.
