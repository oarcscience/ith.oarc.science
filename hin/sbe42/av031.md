## IV, 12. Charm with the plant arundhatî (lâkshâ) for the cure of fractures.

1\. Rohan! art thou, causing to heal (rohanî), the broken bone thou
causest to heal (rohanî): cause this here to heal (rohaya), O
arundhatî!  
2. That bone of thine which, injured and burst, exists in thy person,
Dhâtar shall kindly knit together again, joint with joint!  
3. Thy marrow shall unite with marrow, and thy joint (unite) with joint;
the part of thy flesh that has fallen off, and thy bone shall grow
together again!  
4. Thy marrow shall be joined together with marrow, thy skin grow
together with skin! Thy blood, thy bone shall grow, thy flesh grow
together with flesh!  
5. Fit together hair with hair, and fit together skin with skin! Thy
blood, thy bone shall grow: what is cut join thou together, O plant!  
6. Do thou here rise up, go forth, run forth, (as) a chariot with sound
wheels, firm feloe, and strong nave; stand upright firmly!  
7. If he has been injured by falling into a pit, or if a stone was cast
and hurt him, may he (Dhâtar, the fashioner) fit him together, joint to
joint, as the wagoner (Ribhu) the parts of a chariot!
