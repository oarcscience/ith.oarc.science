## II, 10. Charm against kshetriya, hereditary disease.

1\. From kshetriya (inherited disease), from Nirriti (the goddess of
destruction), from the curse of the kinswoman, from Druh (the demon of
guile), from the fetter of Varuna do I release thee. Guiltless do I
render thee through my charm; may heaven and earth both be propitious to
thee!  
2. May Agni together with the waters be auspicious to thee, may Soma
together with the plants be auspicious. Thus from kshetriya, from
Nirriti, from the curse of the kinswoman, from the Druh, from the fetter
of Varuna do I release thee. Guiltless do I render thee through my
charm; may heaven and earth both be propitious to thee!  
May the wind in the atmosphere auspiciously bestow upon thee strength,
may the four quarters of the heaven be auspicious to thee. Thus from
kshetriya, from Nirriti &c.  
4. These four goddesses, the directions of space, the consorts of the
wind, the sun surveys. Thus from kshetriya, from Nirriti &c.  
5. Within these (directions) I assign thee to old age; forth to a
distance shall go Nirriti and disease! Thus from kshetriya, from Nirriti
&c.  
6. Thou hast been released from disease, from mishap, and from blame;
out from the fetter of Druh, and from Grâhi (the demon of fits) thou
hast been released. Thus from kshetriya, from Nirriti &c.  
7. Thou didst leave behind Arâti (the demon of grudge), didst obtain
prosperity, didst enter the happy world of the pious. Thus from
kshetriya, from Nirriti &c.  
8. The gods, releasing the sun and the ritam (the divine order of the
universe) from darkness and from Grâhi, did take them out of sin. Thus
from kshetriya, from Nirriti &c.
