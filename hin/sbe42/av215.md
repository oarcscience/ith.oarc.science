ukkhishta the world is deposited. Within the ukkhishta Indra and Agni,
and the all are deposited.  
2. In the ukkhishta heaven and earth, and all beings, are deposited; in
the ukkhishta are deposited the waters, the ocean, the moon, and the
wind.  
3. In the ukkhishta are both being and non-being, death, strength
(food), and Pragâpati. The (creatures) of the world are founded upon the
ukkhishta; (also) that which is confined and that which is free, and the
grace in me.  
4. He who fastens what is firm, the strong, the leader, the brahma, the
ten creators of the all, the divinities, are fixed on all sides to the
ukkhishta as the (spokes of the) wheel to the nave.  
5. Rik, Sâman, and Yagus, the singing of the sâmans, their
introductions, and the stotras are in the ukkhishta. The sound 'him' is
in the ukkhishta, and the modulations and the music of the sâman. That
is in me.  
6. The prayer to Indra and Agni (aindrâgnam), the call to the soma, as
it is being purified (pâvamâmam), the mahânâmnî-verses, the singing of
the mahâvrata, (these) divisions of the service are in the ukkhishta, as

vâgapeya, the agnishtoma, and the cattle-sacrifice belonging to it, the

8. The preparation of the sacred fire (agnyâdheyam), the consecration
for the soma-sacrifice (dikshâ), the sacrifice by which (special) wishes
are fulfilled, together with the metres, the sacrifices that have passed

lasts two nights (dvirâtra), the (condensed soma-sacrifice called)
sadyahkrî, and  
(that which is called) prakrî, the (Songs called) ukthya, are woven and
deposited in the ukkhishta; (also the parts) of the sacrifice subtle
through (higher) knowledge.  
11. The soma-sacrifice that lasts four nights (katûrâtra), five nights
(pañkarâtra), six nights (shadrâtra), and along (with them) those that
last double the time; the sixteenfold stotra (shodasin), and the
soma-sacrifice that lasts seven nights (saptarâtra), all the sacrifices
which were founded upon immortality (amrita), were begotten of the
ukkhishta.  
12. The pratihâra-passages (in the sâman-songs), and their final
syllables, the (soma-sacrifices called) visvagit and abhgit, the
soma-sacrifice that ends  
with the day (sâhna), and that which lasts into the next day (atirâtra),
are in the ukkhishta--the soma-sacrifice also that lasts twelve days.
That is in me.

immortality (amrita), and might, all inner desires are satisfied
according to wish in the ukkhishta.  
14. The nine earths, oceans, heavens, are founded upon the ukkhishta.
The sun shines in the ukkhishta, and day and night also. That is in
me.  
15. The (soma-sacrifice called) upahavya, the offering on the middle day
of a sacrifice lasting a year (vishûvant), and the sacrifices that are
secretly presented, Ukkhishta, the sustainer of the universe, the father
of the generator (Pragâpati), supports.  
16. Ukkhishta, the father of the generator, the grandson of the spirit
(asu), the primal ancestor (grandfather), the ruler of the universe, the
lusty bull dwells upon the earth.
