## I, 2. Charm against excessive discharges from the body.

1\. We know the father of the arrow, Parg-anya, who furnishes bountiful
fluid, and well do we know his mother, Prithivi (earth), the
multiform!  
2. O bowstring, turn aside from us, turn my body into stone! Do thou
firmly hold very far away the hostile powers and the haters!  
3. When the bowstring, embracing the wood (of the bow), greets with a
whiz the eaoer arrow, do thou, O Indra, ward off from us the piercing
missile!  
4. As the point (of the arrow) stands in the way of heaven and earth,
thus may the muñga-grass unfailingly stand in the way of sickness and
(excessive) discharge!
