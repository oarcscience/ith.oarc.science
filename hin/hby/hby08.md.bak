# Bhakti Yoga

BHAKTI YOGA teaches that the final end of all religions can be reached
through love and worship of the personal God, who is the Creator and
Governor of the phenomenal universe. It leads to the same destination as
all the other branches of Yoga, but is especially suited for such as are
emotional in their nature and have the feeling of love and devotion
highly developed. It is for those devotees who, conscious of their own
weakness arising from lack of self-control and of knowledge, seek help
from outside; and who, taking refuge in the Supreme, pray to Him for
forgiveness and for pardon of sins committed through ignorance of the
moral and spiritual laws that govern our lives.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

\[paragraph continues\] All dualistic systems of religion, like
Christianity, Judaism, and Mahometanism, which advocate the worship of a
personal God, knowingly or unknowingly preach Bhakti Yoga and direct
their adherents along this path.

The word "Bhakti" means devotion, while Yoga in this case signifies
union of the individual soul with God. Hence Bhakti Yoga is the method
of devotion by which true communion of the soul with the Supreme Deity
is accomplished. It shows what kind of devotion and love for God will
bring the soul into the most intimate relation with the Divine Being;
and how even the ordinary feelings of a human heart, when directed
Godward, can become the means of attaining spiritual oneness with the
Soul of the universe. Râja Yoga tells us that desire, passion, love,
hatred, pride, anger, must be completely conquered

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

before perfection can be reached. A student of Râja Yoga must not only
keep constant watch over his mind, but he must also faithfully practice
the eight steps already described, if he would achieve his highest
ideal; while in Bhakti Yoga we learn that all desires and passions,
whether good or bad, can be directed towards God. Then, instead of
binding the soul to worldliness and earthly attachment, they become a
means of attaining God-consciousness and absolute freedom from
selfishness and wickedness.

A follower of Bhakti Yoga should feel God as closely related to his soul
as he possibly can; and regard Him not only as the Lord of the universe,
but as father, mother, brother, sister, friend, or child. Even the
relation existing between husband and wife may be cultivated and
developed in the heart of a lover of

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

\[paragraph continues\] God, intoxicated by the soul-stirring wine of
Divine Love. When the whole heart and soul of a Bhakta or lover of God
flow like the unbroken current of a mighty river, surmounting all
barriers and dashing headlong toward the ocean of Divinity, he finds no
other attraction in the world, holds no other thought, cherishes no
other desire, speaks no other word, and sees no other thing than his
most Beloved, the Omnipresent Deity. He resigns himself entirely to Him
and surrenders his will to the will of the Almighty One. He works, but
without thinking of results. Every action of his body and mind is
performed simply to please his Beloved One. His motive power is love
alone and by this he breaks asunder the chain of selfishness, transcends
the law of Karma, and becomes free. Thus a true Bhakti Yogi, being
constantly in tune with the Infinite, loses the

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

sense of "I," "Me," and "Mine," and makes room for "Thou," "Thee," and
"Thine."

A Bhakta never forgets his relation to his Beloved. His mind is
concentrated and one-pointed; consequently meditation becomes easy for
him. True devotion or continuous remembrance of the Divine Ideal leads
to unceasing meditation, and ultimately lifts the soul into Samâdhi,
where it realizes God and communes with Him undisturbed by any other
thought, feeling, idea, or sensation. Becoming dead to sense phenomena,
it lives on the spiritual plane of God-consciousness. Wherever such a
Yogi casts his eyes, he sees the presence of the All-pervading Divinity
and enjoys unbounded peace and happiness at every moment of his life. It
is for this reason that Bhakti Yoga is considered to be the easiest of
all

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

methods. What a Râja Yogi attains only after years of practice, a Bhakta
accomplishes in a short time through extreme devotion and love. That
which a Karma Yogi finds so difficult to achieve, a Bhakti Yogi attains
easily by offering the fruits of all his works to the Almighty Source of
all activity and the ultimate end of all motives.

Bhakti Yoga has two grades,--the first is called "Gauni," or preparatory
and includes all the preliminary practices; the second is "Para," or the
state of supreme love and devotion to God. A beginner in Bhakti Yoga
should first of all prepare the ground of his heart by freeing it from
attachment to earthly objects and sense-pleasures; then by arousing in
it extreme longing to see God, to realize Divinity, to go to the Source
of all knowledge, and to reach perfection and God-consciousness in this
life. He must be absolutely earnest

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

and sincere. He should seek the company of a true lover of God, whose
life is pure and spotless, who has renounced all worldly connections,
and who has realized the true relation which the individual soul bears
to the Universal Spirit. If, by good fortune, he meets such a real
Bhakta, he should receive from him the seed of Bhakti, plant it in the
ground of his heart, and by faithfully following the instructions of the
master, take special care to keep it alive and make it grow, until it
becomes a large tree bearing the fruit of Divine Love. He should have
respect, reverence, and love for his master, who will open his spiritual
eye and transmit his own spiritual powers to his soul. When these powers
begin to work, the soul will be awakened from the deep sleep of
ignorance and self-delusion.

The Guru, or spiritual eye-opener, knowing

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

the natural tendency of the disciple, will advise him to look upon God
as his Master, or as his Father or Mother, and will thus establish a
definite relation between his soul and God. Henceforth the disciple
should learn to worship or pray to the Supreme through this particular
relation. At this stage symbols, rituals, ceremonies may appeal to his
mind; or he may repeat some name of the Lord that signifies the special
aspect of the Divinity corresponding to the relation which he bears to
Him. Constant repetition of such a name will help the mind of the
neophyte to become concentrated upon the Divine Being. During this
period he should avoid such company, such places, and such amusements as
make him forget his chosen Ideal. He should live a chaste and pure life,
always discriminating right from wrong and struggling to control his
passions

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

and desires by directing them Godward. He should be angry with himself
for not realizing his ideal; he should hate his sinful nature because it
keeps him away from the path of Bhakti and prevents him from remembering
his Beloved. Thus he will gradually succeed in correcting his faults and
in gaining control over his animal nature.

A traveller on the path of Bhakti should observe cleanliness of body and
mind, should be truthful, and lead a simple life, without injuring any
living creature mentally or physically. He should not kill any animal
for his food, neither should he covet that which does not belong to him.
He should, furthermore, obey the laws of health which tend to make him
physically strong, as well as those moral laws the violation of which
weakens the mind.

So long as the devotee thinks of God

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

with a form and believes that He is outside of his soul and of the
universe, he can make a mental picture of Him and worship the Divine
Ideal through that form; or he may keep before him some symbolic figure
like the cross which will remind him of his Ideal at the time of
devotion. But a Bhakta should never mistake the imaginary form or the
symbolic figure for the real Ideal. Wherever there is such a mistake
there is to be found spiritual degeneration and the expression of
ignorance in the form of sectarianism, bigotry, fanaticism.

Gradually, as the Bhakta approaches God, he will rise above such
dualistic conceptions and realize that his Beloved is not only
transcendent but immanent in nature, that nature is His body, that He
dwells everywhere, that He is the Soul of our souls and the Life of our
life, that He is the one stupendous Whole while we are but

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

\[paragraph continues\] His parts. The Bhakta then reaches that state
which is called qualified non-dualism. He sees that from the minutest
insect up to man all living creatures are related to the Iswara <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) s a part is related to the whole. Therefore
he cannot kill or injure any living being. Understanding that everything
pertaining to any part belongs in reality to the whole, he says,
"Whatever is mine is Thine"; and it is from this moment that absolute
self-resignation and self-surrender to the will of the Iswara begin to
reign supreme in the soul of the Yogi. Then he is able to say from the
bottom of his heart, "Let Thy will be done," and never again can he
forget that his soul is a part of the Iswara. His devotion henceforth
consists in remembering this new relation, and his

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

worship takes a new form. Whatever he does with mind or body becomes an
act of worship of the Supreme Whole, for he realizes that he possesses
no power that does not belong to God. Eating, drinking, walking,
talking, and every other work of his daily life become acts of devotion,
and the entire existence of such a Bhakta is a continuous series of acts
of worship. Then the heart is purified and selfishness is dead.

The devotee thus rises to the second grade of Bhakti Yoga and begins to
taste that Divine Love which is the fruit of the tree of Bhakti. Here
all distinction between lover and Beloved disappears; the lover, the
Beloved and Love all merge into one ocean of Divinity. The soul of the
Bhakta is transformed, and manifesting omniscience, God-consciousness,
perfect freedom, and all other Divine qualities, it attains to the
highest ideal of Bhakti Yoga.
