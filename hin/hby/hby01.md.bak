# Preface

THE Vedânta Philosophy includes the different branches of the Science of
Yoga. Four of these have already been treated at length by the Swâmi
Vivekananda in his works on "Râja Yoga," "Karma Yoga," "Bhakti Yoga,"
and "Jnâna Yoga"; but there existed no short and consecutive survey of
the science as a whole. It is to meet this need that the present volume
has been written. In an introductory chapter are set forth the true
province of religion and the full significance of the word
"spirituality" as it is understood in India. Next follows a
comprehensive definition of the term "Yoga," with short chapters on each
of

the five paths to which it is applied, and their respective practices.
An exhaustive exposition of the Science of Breathing and its bearing on
the highest spiritual development shows the fundamental physiological
principles on which the whole training of Yoga is based; while a
concluding chapter, under the title "Was Christ a Yogi?" makes plain the
direct relation existing between the lofty teachings of Vedânta and the
religious faiths of the West. An effort has been made, so far as
possible, to keep the text free from technical and Sanskrit terms; and
the work should therefore prove of equal value to the student of
Oriental thought and to the general reader as yet unfamiliar with this,
one of the greatest philosophical systems of the world.
