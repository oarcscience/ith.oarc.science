DURING the Vedic Age, which came to a close in the eighth century B.C.,
the Aryan settlers spread gradually eastward and southward. At first
they occupied the Punjab, but ere the Rigvedic period was ended they had
reached the banks of the Jumna and the Ganges in the "Middle Country".
In the early hymns the great Himalayan mountains dominate fertile river
valleys, but the greater part of northern India is covered by vast and
dense forests. No mention is made of the sea.

The Aryans were a pastoral and hunting people, with some knowledge of
agriculture. They possessed large herds of cattle, and had also sheep,
goats, and asses; they were, besides, famous breeders and tamers of
horses; the faithful dog, man's earliest friend, followed both herds-man
and hunter. The plough was in use, and bullocks were yoked to it; grain
was thrashed in primitive manner

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

and ground between "pounding stones". Barley and wheaten cakes, milk,
curds, butter, and cheese, and wild fruits were the chief articles of
diet; the products of the chase were also eaten, but there appears to
have been at the earliest period a restriction in the consumption of
certain foods. Beef was not eaten at meals. Bulls were sacrificed to the
gods. Two kinds of intoxicating liquors were brewed--the mysterious
Soma, beloved by deities, and a mead or ale called "sura", the Avestan
"hura", prepared probably from grain, which had ever an evil reputation
as a cause of peace-breaking, like dice, and of wrongdoing generally.

Metals were in use, for the earliest Aryan invasion took place in the
Bronze Age, during which there were great race movements and invasions
and conquests in Asia and in Europe. It is doubtful whether or not iron
was known by the earliest Aryan settlers in India; it was probably not
worked, but may have been utilized for charms, as in those countries in
which meteoric iron was called "the metal of heaven". The knowledge of
the mechanical arts had advanced beyond the primitive stage. Warriors
fought not only on foot but also in chariots, and they wore
breastplates; their chief weapons were bows and horn or metal-tipped
arrows, maces, battleaxes, swords, and spears. Smiths roused their fires
with feather fans; carpenters are mentioned in the hymns, and even
barbers who used razors.

The father was the head of the family, and the family was the tribal
unit. War was waged by a loose federation of small clans, each of which
was distinguished by the name of a patriarch. The necessity of having to
conduct frequent campaigns in a new country, peopled by hostile aliens,
no doubt tended to weld tribal units into small kingdoms and to promote
the monarchic system. But

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

intertribal feuds were frequent and bitter. The Aryans of the Punjab,
like the Gauls who settled in northern Italy, and the clans of the
Scottish Highlands in the Middle Ages, were continually divided among
themselves, and greatly occupied in subduing rivals and in harrying
their cattle.

Villages were protected by stockades or earthworks against the attacks
of enemies and wild beasts, or they contained strongholds. They were
governed by headsmen, who were, no doubt, military leaders also;
disputes were settled by a judge. Land, especially grazing land, appears
to have been held in common by communities, but there are indications
that cultivated plots and houses were owned by families and ultimately
by individuals, the father in such cases being the supreme authority.
Village communities, however, might be migratory, and certain of them
may have had seasonal areas of settlement.

Permanent villages existed in groups and also at some distance from one
another, and were connected by roads, and one clan might embrace several
separate communities. Trade was conducted by barter, the cow being the
standard of value, but in time jewels and gold ornaments were used like
money for purchases; "nishka", a necklet, afterwards signified a coin.
Foreign traders were not unknown at an early period. The use of
alphabetic signs appears to have been introduced by Semites before the
close of the Vedic period; from these evolved ultimately the scientific
Sanskrit alphabet and grammar.

In the Iranian period <span id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_127.md) there were
social divisions of the people, but the hereditary system does not
appear to have obtained until the close of Rigvedic times. Kings might
be elected, or a military aristocracy might impose its sway over an
area; a priest was originally a poet or

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

leader of thought, or a man of elevated character, like the Scottish
Highland *duine-usual*, the "upwardly man", who might be the son of a
chief or of the humblest member of a community.

The earliest Aryan divisions of society were apparently marked by
occupations. At first there were three grades: warriors, priests, and
traders, but all classes might engage in agricultural pursuits; even in
the Epic period princes counted and branded cattle. In the later Vedic
age, however, a rigid system of castes came into existence, the result,
apparently, of having to distinguish between Aryans and aborigines at
first, and subsequently between the various degrees of Aryans who had
intermarried with aliens. Caste (Varna) signifies colour, and its
relation to occupation is apparent in the four divisions--Brahmans,
priests; Kshatriyas, the military aristocracy; Vaisyas, commoners,
workers, and traders, who were freemen; and Sudras, slaves and
aborigines. In the *Yajurveda*, the third Veda, the caste system is
found established on a hereditary basis. The three upper castes, which
were composed of Aryans only, partook in all religious ceremonials, but
the members of the Sudra caste were hedged about by severe restrictions.
The knowledge of the Vedas was denied to them, and they were not allowed
to partake of Soma offerings, and although in the process of time their
position improved somewhat in the religious life of the mingled people,
their social inferiority was ever emphasized; they might become traders,
but never Kshatriyas or Brahmans.

The most renowned of early Brahmans were the Rishis, the poets <span
id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_128.md) who composed the "new songs" to the

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

gods. They were regarded as divinely inspired men and their fame was
perpetuated after death. Several renowned poets are referred to in
sacred literature and invested with great sanctity. The hymns or mantras
were committed to memory and then handed down from generation to
generation. At religious ceremonies these were chanted by reciters, the
Hotri priests. There were also priests who were skilled in the correct
performance of sacrificial rites, and family priests, the Purohitas, who
were the guides, philosophers, and friends of kings and noblemen. A
Rishi might be a Purohita and a seer, who ensured by the performance of
mystic ceremonies a monarch's success in battle and afterwards
celebrated his achievements in song.

In the process of time an organized priesthood carne into existence, and
a clan or kingdom had its chief priest. The production of new hymns came
to an end; those which existed were considered sufficient for all
purposes; religious beliefs were systematized, and an arbitrary ritual
became more and more complicated.

There are indications that at an early period a chief or king might
offer up a sacrifice, but when the profession of the Brahman became
hereditary, no rite could be performed unless presided over by holy men.
A sacrifice might be rendered futile by an error in the construction of
an altar, or in the order of ceremonial practices, or by failure to
select appropriate chants. The Asuras and Rakshasas and other demons
were ever hovering round the altar, endeavouring to obstruct ceremonies
and to take advantage of ritualistic errors to intercept offerings
intended for the gods. It was by making sacrifices that man was believed
to obtain power over the gods, or magical control over the forces of
nature.

For the performance of some sacrifices a day of preparation

might be required. Altars had to be erected with mathematical exactness;
the stones were blessed and anointed; offerings were made at every stage
of the work so that the various deities might give protection in their
various spheres. The following extract from one of the Brahmanas affords
a glimpse of the preparatory rites:--

Thrice he (the priest) perambulates it (the altar); for thrice he walks
round it (whilst sprinkling); thus as many times as he walks round it,
so many times does he perambulate it. . . .

Having thereupon put that stone into the water pitcher, (he) throws it
in that (south-westerly) direction, for that is Nirriti's region; he
thus consigns pain to Nirriti's region. . . .

Outside the fire altars he throws it, &c. <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_129.md)

Human failings may be imputed to Brahmans, but it must be recognized
that the ideals of their caste were of a high order. They were supposed
to be born with "spiritual lustre", and their lives were consecrated to
the instruction and uplifting of mankind and the attainment of
salvation. A Brahman's life was divided into four periods. The first was
the period of childhood, and the second was the period of probation,
when he went to live in a forest hermitage, where he acted as the
servant of a revered old sage, his spiritual father, and received
instruction in Brahmanic knowledge for a number of years. During the
third period the Brahman lived the worldly life; he married and reared a
family and performed the duties pertaining to his caste. Hospitality was
one of the chief worldly duties; if a stranger, even although he might
be an enemy, came and asked for food he received it, although the
Brahman family should have to fast to supply him. In the fourth period
the Brahman, having proved himself a faithful husband and exemplary
father,

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

divided his worldly possessions between his grown-up sons and daughters;
then he abandoned his comfortable home and, assuming the deerskin
clothing of hermits, went to live in a lonely forest, or among the
Himalayan mountains, to prepare for the coming of death, far away from
the shadows cast by sin and sorrow. In solitude he performed rigid
penances and addressed himself with single-minded devotion to the
contemplation of spiritual problems. Subduing the five senses, he
attained to the state of Yoga (concentration). Placing his mind entirely
upon the contemplation of the soul, he became united ultimately with the
World Soul (God), thus obtaining the release which was Salvation. Some
Brahmans were teachers who instructed pupils and composed the sacred
writings. The forest hermitages were the universities of ancient India.

The profession of the priesthood had certainly its mercenary aspect;
sacrificial fees were fixed as well as sacrificial rites, and a not
unimportant part of a ceremony was the offering of generous gifts to the
Brahmans, who presided at the altar. But on the whole the riches thus
expended were not given in vain. As in Egypt, the rise and endowment of
the priestly cult was due to the accumulation of wealth which enabled a
section of society to find leisure for study and the promotion of
culture. Aryan civilization in India owed much to the Brahmans. They
introduced and elaborated alphabetic signs; the devoted scholars among
them compiled the first Sanskrit grammar and studied the art of
composition. Among the hermits there were great and original thinkers
who laid the basis of Indian metaphysical thought, and rose from the
materialism of the early Vedic hymns to the idealism of the speculative
prose works, which included the *Forest Books*, a name redolent of leafy
solitude and of simple

 

<span id="img_08200"></span>

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

and contemplative lives on the banks of sweetly-flowing waters. Even
their devotion to the mysteries of sacrificial ritual, which became more
and more complicated, was not unproductive of permanent benefits to
mankind. The necessity for the exact construction of altars, and the
observance of ceremonies in due season, promoted the study of
mathematical science. These Brahmans invented the numerical figures
which have attained universal usage, and in time they gave the world
Algebra. The influence of their culture may be traced in other
directions. At the present day it has indirectly brought into existence
the science of Comparative Religion.

At the close of the Rigvedic period the Aryans had extended their sway
to the district known as Madhyadesa, the "middle country", between the
"Five Rivers" of the Punjab and the upper reaches of the Jumna and
Ganges. Pioneers were meantime pressing southward and eastward towards
the sea. Migrations were, no doubt, due to propulsion as well as
attraction; fresh folk-waves probably poured in periodically from the
north-west, while the settled population must have increased rapidly in
the fertile land controlled by the invaders, to whom the aborigines
offered but slight resistance.

The second Vedic book, the *Samaveda*, does not contain much fresh
material: it is mainly a compilation of the Rigvedic hymns which the
priests chanted at the Soma sacrifice. Its sole interest, from a
historical point of view, is the evidence it affords of the steady
growth of ritualistic tendencies. A new era of Aryan civilization is
revealed, however, by the third Veda, the *Yajurveda*. In this book the
tribes are found to have extended their area of control down the Ganges
valley, and southward along the banks of the Indus. It is of interest to
note here that the word "Samudra", first applied to the broadening Indus
where

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

it receives its tributaries, and signifying "collected waters" became in
the *Brahmanas* the name of the world-encircling ocean, across which in
due time loomed the ships which "once in three years" carried to
Solomon's order "gold, and silver, ivory (or elephants' tusks), and
apes, and peacocks". <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_130.md)

In the *Yajurveda* we find that Aryan civilization has developed greatly
in the course of three or four centuries. Powerful tribes have
established kingdoms, and small states are being subjected to the
larger. The hardened system of social organization is reflected by the
references to the four distinct castes. Hitherto the Kshatriyas have
controlled the destinies of the people, but now the Brahmans achieve an
intellectual conquest and impose their sway over kings and nobles. The
holy men are no longer the humble servants of generous patrons; they are
the human representatives of the all-controlling deities. "Verily, there
are two kinds of gods; for the gods themselves, assuredly, are gods, and
those priests who have studied and teach Vedic lore, are the human
gods."

The offerings to the deities are "consecrated by the feeding of
priests". <span id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_131.md)

Even the gods become dependent upon the priests, who provided them by
offering sacrifices with the "food" they required, and also with the
Soma which gave them length of years. Indra could not combat against the
Asuras without the assistance of the priests who chanted formulas to
ensure victory; it was, therefore, due to the power exercised, in the
first place, by the priests that the drought demon was overcome and rain
fell in abundance.

Priests might also accumulate in heaven credit balances

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

of Celestial power by undergoing penances for long periods. A heavy debt
was also due to them by the gods for their sacrificial offerings. When a
Brahman desired to exercise his accumulated power, he might even depose
the deities, who were therefore placed under compulsion to fulfil his
demands; his Celestial credit might exceed the "paying" possibilities of
the supreme Powers. In the sacred tales Brahmans were credited with
performing rigid penances for centuries.

In the fourth Veda, the *Atharva-veda*, the revival of belief in
formulas is emphasized. This book, which did not receive recognition as
an inspired work at first, is in the main a collection of metrical
charms of great antiquity. Many resemble closely those which have been
collected by folk-lorists during late years in the Scottish Highlands
and elsewhere throughout Europe. The Rigveda hymns reveal the religious
beliefs and aspirations of the advanced thinkers of their age; the
*Atharva-veda* contains the germs of folk religion--the magical formulas
chanted to dispel or invoke the vague spirits who helped or thwarted
mankind. It teaches that the Universe is upheld by sacrifice and the
spiritual exaltation of Brahmans, and that Brahmanic power may be
exercised by the use of appropriate charms. Human beings might also be
influenced by the Spirits invoked by means of formulas.

Primitive man believed that all emotions were caused by spirits. When
the poet sang, he was "inspired"--he drew in a spirit; ecstasy was "a
standing outside of oneself", the soul having escaped temporarily from
the body. Wrath was caused by a demon, and "battle fury" by the spirit
of war which possessed the warrior. When a human being was "seized" by a
fit, his convulsions were believed to be caused by the demon who had
entered his body. Love was inspiration in the literal sense, and an

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indian lover might
compel a heedless lady to regard him with favour by reciting an
Atharva-vedic spell. Apparently the love spirit had a weakness for
honey. The lover chanted:

Honey be mine at the tip of my tongue,  
May sweetness of honey pervade my speech,  
So that my love may come under my spell--  
So that my lady may yield to my will.  
                                  *Atharva-veda*, i, 34.

As the grass is shorn from earth by the wind,  
So may thy soul be shorn to my will,  
And then, O lady, thou’lt give me thy love,  
Nor be averse to me as thou wert.  
                                  *Atharva-veda*, ii, 30.

A lover, we find, can invoke the lady to embrace him "as the creeper
embraces a tree"; if she clings to his arm he can cause her to cling to
his heart; his influence over her mind is like the influence of a
wing-beating eagle over the wind. It may be, too, that a neglected girl
finds it necessary to prepare a love potion with "salve, sweet wood, and
spikenard", and to cause the heart of an ungallant swain to suffer from
"a parching heart", which "languishes for love", and experiences the
"yearning of the Apsaras".

Warriors were charmed against spells, cattle and sheep were charmed
against wild beasts, a house was charmed against evil spirits and
demons. <span id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_132.md) Greedy demons of disease,
who devoured the flesh of patients, were greatly feared: Brahmans
performed ceremonies of riddance and

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "plagued them as
the tiger plagues the cattle owners . The following is a charm against
cough:

As the soul with the soul's desires swiftly to a distance flies,  
Thus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the soul's course of flight.  
As a well-sharpened arrow swiftly to a distance flies,  
Thus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the expanse of the earth.  
As the rays of the sun swiftly to a distance fly,  
Thus do thou, O cough, fly forth along the flood of the sea.  
                                    *Atharva-veda*, vi, 105. <span
id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_133.md)

A Scottish Highland charm similarly invokes the Powers, or the "King of
the Elements":

To cause the wrath of men to ebb,  
Like to a wave from the sea to the floodtide,  
And a wave from the floodtide to the ebb.

Occasionally a mantra is infused with high religious fervour. A Brahman
might pray:

From the sins which knowingly or unknowingly we have committed, do ye,
all gods, of one accord release us.  
If awake or asleep, to sin inclined, I have committed a sin, may what
has been, and what shall be, as if from a wooden post, release
me.          *Atharva-veda*, vi, 115. 1-2. <span
id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_134.md)

Another hymn of this character concludes:

In heaven, where our righteous friends are blessed,  
Having cast off diseases from their bodies,  
From lameness free and not deformed in members,  
There may we see our parents and our children.  
                               *Atharva-veda*, vi, 120. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_135.md)

While the tribes were spreading southward and eastward,

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Madhyadesa, the
"middle country", remained the centre of Brahmanic culture. In that
district came into existence the earliest sacred prose works which
constitute the basis of classic Hinduism. The first were the oldest
*Brahmanas*; these comment on and expound the doctrines of the Vedic
hymns, especially in their relation to the ritual of sacrifices. To the
Brahmanas were added the *Aran´yakas*, "forest books", which are more
speculative in tendency. The expository appendices to the *Aran´yakas*
are called the *Upanishads*, "the sittings down", or "the sessions"--the
pupil sat at his master's feet--and in these a high level of thought is
attained. "For the first time", says Professor Macdonell, "we find the
Absolute grasped and proclaimed."

All the tribes were not infused with the same degree of culture. In the
*Yajur-veda* period there were various schools of thought, and these
continued to exercise their influence into historic times, even after
Upanishadic doctrines became widespread.

Ere we deal, however, with the new theological doctrines of the
Brahmanic teachers, we should follow the development of sacrificial
practices, because from these evolved the bold Pantheism which
characterized the conception of the World Soul, Brahma.

The two greatest sacrifices were the *purusha-medha*, the human
sacrifice, and *aswa-medha*, the sacrifice of the horse. Both were
prevalent in early times, and in simpler form than they survive to us in
the doctrinal works and the Epics. A human sacrifice was believed to be
of highest potency, but it became extremely rare, as in Egypt, among the
ruling and cultured classes. It was perpetuated in India, however, until
about half a century ago, by the Dravidian Khonds in Bengal and Madras,
and had to be suppressed by British officers.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Human sacrifices,
in historic times, were "offered to the earth goddess, Tari Pennu or
Bera Pennu, and were believed to ensure good crops, and immunity from
all diseases and accidents". One official record states that the victim,
after being stabbed by the priest, was "literally cut to pieces". Each
person who was "so fortunate as to procure it carried away a morsel of
the flesh, and presented it to the idol of his own village". <span
id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_136.md)

From the practice of sacrificing human beings arose the conception that
the first act of Creation was, if not human sacrifice, at least the
sacrifice of the first being with human attributes. The Universe is the
giant Purusha ("man"); he is "all that hath been and shall be". In a
Rigvedic hymn, which is regarded as being of later composition than the
Rigvedic period, it is set forth:

"When the gods performed a sacrifice with Purusha as the oblation, the
Spring was its butter, the Summer its fuel, and the Autumn its
(accompanying) offering. This victim, Purusha, born in the beginning,
they immolated on the sacrificial grass."

From this universal sacrifice issued forth all that exists. The Brahman
rose from Purusha's mouth, the Rajanya (Kshatriya) from his arms, the
Vaisya from his thighs, and the Sudra sprang from his feet. Indra and
Agni came from his mouth, and Vayu from his breath.

"When the gods, performing sacrifice, bound Purusha as a victim, there
were seven sticks (stuck up) for it (around the fire). . . . With
sacrifice the gods performed the sacrifice. These were the earliest
rites." <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_137.md)

"From his (Purusha's) navel arose the air, from his head the sky, from
his ears the four quarters; in this

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

manner (the gods) formed the worlds." This conception resembles closely
the story in Teutonic mythology of the cutting up by the gods of the
body of the chaos giant Ymer; his skull became the sky, his bones the
rocks, his blood the sea, and so on. One of the Chinese P’an Ku <span
id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_138.md) myths is of similar character; the world
is composed of different parts of his body. The Babylonian Merodach also
divided the body of the chaos demon, Tiawath or Tiamat; her head became
the sky, her body the earth, and her blood the rivers which fill the
sea. Purusha, the chaos giant of India, had "a thousand heads, a
thousand eyes, and a thousand feet"; the earth was equal to the space
covered by ten of his fingers; he was "the whole universe".

The horse sacrifice was also infused, like the human sacrifice, with
symbolic significance. It was probably practised in the early Iranian
period by the Aryan horse tamers, who may have substituted man's
fleet-footed friend for human beings. The Mongolian Buriats in the
vicinity of Lake Baikal, Siberia, are the latest surviving sacrificers
of the domesticated animal. Their horse sacrifice (Tailgan) was held on
2 August on a sacred hill inhabited by their gods, the Burkans, "the
masters". The horse was bound, thrown upon its back and held tightly by
ropes, while the officiating person cut open its breast and pulled out
the pulsating heart like the sacrificers of human beings in Ancient
Mexico. The animal's bones were burned on the altars, and the flesh was
cooked and devoured by the worshippers. Portions of the flesh, and some
of the broth prepared, were given to the flames, which also received
libations of the liquor called *tarasun*, distilled from soul milk.
*Tarasun* was

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

the Soma of the Buriats, and their fire spirit was, like the Indian
Agni, a ready drinker of it. Bits of food were also flung to aerial
spirits, while oblations were poured on the hill, the belief prevailing
that these offerings multiplied sufficiently to permit of the gods
feeding sumptuously. As each of the worshippers of the spirits of nature
accepted a portion of sacrificial food, a prayer was chanted, entreating
the gods to cause increase of all things.

"Let our villages be one verst longer," they said; "create cattle in our
enclosures; under our blankets create a son; send down rain from high
heaven to us; cause much grass to grow; create so much grain that the
sickle cannot raise it, and so much grass that the scythe cannot cut
it."

After the sacrifice, the food was divided and the fragments that
remained were carefully burned, "for none of it must be eaten by dogs;
that would be desecration, and misfortune would follow in its
wake". <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_139.md)

The purpose of this annual sacrifice was evidently to secure fertility
and prosperity generally, and we refer to it here so fully because of
the light it throws on the Indian ceremonial which it resembles closely
in some of its details.

There are two direct references to the horse sacrifice in the
*Rigveda*. <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_140.md) The animal is "covered
with rich trappings" and led thrice round the altar. It is accompanied
by a goat, which is killed first to "announce the sacrifice to the
gods". A goat was also slain at a burial to inform the gods that the
soul was about to enter Heaven.

In the *Story of Nala* and in the *Ramáyana*, the horse

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

sacrifice is performed to secure human offspring. A second *Ramáyana*
horse sacrifice is offered as an atonement after the slaying of the
demon Ravana. An elaborate account of this great ceremonial is also
given in the *Mahábhárata*. It was performed after "the great war" on
the advice of the sage Vyasa to atone for the slaying of kinsmen. The
horse was let loose and an army followed it. Whichever country the
animal entered had to be conquered for the owner of the horse, so that
only a powerful monarch could fulfil the conditions of the sacrifice. A
hundred such sacrifices might enable a king to depose Indra.

It is significant, however, that the animal was released to wander from
kingdom to kingdom on the night of the full moon in the spring month of
Choitro, and that it returned in the following year at the close of the
winter season. When the ground was prepared by being ploughed by the
king, the queen followed him, sowing the seeds of every kind of
vegetable and curative herb which grew in the kingdom. A countless
number of representative animals were sacrificed before the sacred horse
was slain, the rain drum and trumpet were sounded, and the king and
queen were drenched with holy water.

The flesh of the horse was cooked and eaten, and Indra and the other
gods appeared and partook of their portions. Pieces were also flung in
the fire, and the fire received also its meed of Soma. When the
sacrifice was completed, the king divided the herb offerings among the
people; what remained over was burned.

In the *Mahábhárata* a white horse is sacrificed, but in the *Ramáyana*
a black victim is offered up. White horses were sacrificed to Mars by
the Romans; the Greeks sacrificed white horses to the sun by throwing

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

then in the sea; the Spartans offered up their horses, like the Buriats,
on a hilltop.

There can be little doubt that the Greek and Roman horse sacrifices were
also intended to ensure fertility. A horse was offered up to Diana at
the August harvest festival, and we know that that popular goddess gave
plentiful crops and was the guardian of flocks and herds and wild
animals of the chase; she also presided at birth, and women invoked her
aid. Virgins and youths took a prominent part at this harvest festival.
The Roman horse sacrifice took place on 15 October. The animal was
offered to Mars; the head was conveyed to the king's house <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) and decorated with loaves, and the blood
was preserved until April, when it was mixed by virgins with the blood
of calves; this mixture was given to shepherds to ensure the increase of
flocks which were fumigated. In the *Mahábhárata* the king and the
princes stand for a time in the smoke belching from the altar, to be
cleansed of their sins.

The Persians, and other peoples of Aryan speech and custom, sacrificed
horses regularly. But the custom was not confined to Indo-Europeans. The
Scythians, <span id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_142.md) who were probably
Mongols, not only offered horses to the Spirit of Fertility, but also,
like the Buriats, to the dead. The Patagonians sacrificed horses to tree
spirits. In this connection it may be noted that some European horse
sacrifices took place in sacred groves; the Buriats tied their horse to
a birch tree, which was carried to the mountain top and fixed to a
stake; the Indian sacrificial posts were probably substitutes for trees.

In the *Upanishads* the sacrifice of the horse is infused, as we have
indicated, with mystic symbolism. We read:

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "The dawn in truth
is the head of the sacrificial horse, The sun is the eye; the wind the
breath . . . the year the body, the heaven is the back . . . the
constellations the bones; the sky the muscles; the rivers, arteries and
veins; the liver and spleen, the mountains; the herbs and trees, the
various kinds of hair." The horse is also identified with the sun: "The
sun, as long as he rises is the fore part of the body; the sun, as long
as he descends is the hind part of the body, &c." The horse is also day
and night in turn, and its birthplace is the sea; it carries the gods
and the Asuras; it is the symbol of Death, "who is voracity", from whom
all things came. "There was not anything here before." Death first
"created this mind, desiring, *May I have a soul*. He went forth
worshipping. From him, when worshipping, the waters were produced. . . .
The froth of the waters which was there became consistent. This became
the earth. . . . He made himself threefold. His eastern quarter is the
head . . . his western quartet is the tail, &c."

The work of Creation proceeds, and then "he (Death as the Creator)
resolved to devour all that he had created; for he eats all. . . . He is
the eater of the whole universe; this whole universe is his food."

After a year of purification the Creator slaughtered his horse body. "He
gave up the animal to the gods. Therefore they (the gods) slaughter the
purified animal, representing in its nature, as Prajápati, all deities.
He (the Creator) is the Ashwameda <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_143.md)
who shines."

The gods performed the sacrifice to overcome the demons, the
representatives of sin. Therefore the horse sacrifice removes all sin.

After much fantastic symbolism the following lesson

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

in the form of a mantra is extracted from the parable of Creation:--

"From the unreal lead me to the real, from darkness lead me to light,
from death lead me to immortality."

The Upanishadic treatment of the Purusha myth differs somewhat from the
Vedic, and is intended to strengthen the Monotheistic tendencies
displayed in some of the hymns.

When the Universal soul, according to this later doctrine, took at the
beginning "the shape of a man" . . . he "beheld nothing but himself".

"He said first *This, I am*. Hence the name of 'I' was produced.
Therefore, even now a man, when called, says first, 'It is I', and tells
afterwards any other name that belongs to him. And, because He, as the
first of all of them consumed by fire all the sins, therefore he is
called Purusha. . . .

He was afraid; therefore man, when alone, is afraid. He then looked
round. Since nothing but myself exists, of whom should I be afraid?
Hence his fear departed; for whom should he fear, since fear arises from
another.

He did not feel delight. Therefore nobody, when alone, feels delight. He
was desirous of a second. He was in the same state as husband (Pati) and
wife (Patni). . . . He divided this self twofold. Hence were husband and
wife produced. Therefore was this only a half of himself, as a split pea
is of the whole. . . . This void is thus completed by woman. He
approached her. Hence men were born."

The first two "mortals" then assumed the forms of all creatures, male
and female in turn. They were, in order, the first cattle, the first
horses, the first asses, the first goats, the first sheep, and so on.
"In this manner He created every living pair whatsoever down to the
ants." Then he reflected and said: "I am verily this creation, for I
created this all."

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

The lesson then follows. Men say, "Sacrifice to this, sacrifice to this,
sacrifice to one or the other god?" But these words are "not proper",
because "He is really this creation; for he verily is all the gods".

Thus the first Being, as a commentator remarked, "whose nature
comprehended all elements, who is eternal, who is not conceived by
thought, sprang forth by himself. . . . He consumed all sins, for unless
one is in a worldly state he cannot consume sins. . . . Being mortal he
created immortals." <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_144.md)

From the myth of the chaos-giant Purusha we pass to the higher
pantheistic conception of Brahmă, the soul of the Universe.
