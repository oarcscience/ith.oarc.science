King Pandu became a mighty monarch, and was renowned as a warrior and a
just ruler of his kingdom. He married two wives: Pritha, who was chief
rani, and Madri <span id="fr_215"></span>[2](#fn_214.md), whom he loved
best.

Now Pritha was of celestial origin, for her mother was a nymph; her
father was a holy Brahman, and her brother, Vasudeva, was the father of
Krishna. <span id="fr_216"></span>[3](#fn_215.md) When but a babe she had
been adopted by the Rajah of Shurasena, whose kingdom was among the
Vindhya mountains. She was of pious heart, and ever showed reverence
towards holy men. Once there came to the palace the great Rishi
Durvasas, and she ministered unto him faithfully by serving food at any
hour he desired, and by kindling the sacred fire in the sacrificial
chamber. After his stay, which was in length a full year, Durvasas, in
reward for her services, imparted to Pritha a powerful charm <span
id="fr_217"></span>[4](#fn_216.md), by

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

virtue of which she could compel the love of a celestial being. One day
she had a vision of Surya, god of the sun; she muttered the charm, and
received him when he drew nigh in the attire of a rajah, wearing the
celestial ear-rings. In secret she became in time the mother of his son,
Karna, who was equipped at birth with celestial ear-rings and an
invulnerable coat of mail, which had power to grow as the wearer
increased in stature. The child had the eyes of a lion and the shoulders
of a bull.

In her maidenly shame Pritha resolved to conceal her new-born babe. So
she wrapped him in soft sheets and, laying under his head a costly
pillow, placed him in a basket of wicker-work which she had smeared over
with wax. Then, weeping bitterly, she set the basket afloat on the
river, saying: "O my babe, be thou protected by all who are on land, and
in the water, and in the sky, and in the celestial regions! May all who
see thee love thee! May Varuna, god of the waters, shield thee from
harm! May thy father, the sun, give thee warmth! . . . I shall know thee
in days to come, wherever thou mayst be, by thy coat of golden mail. . .
. She who will find thee and adopt thee will be surely blessed. . . . O
my son, she who will cherish thee will behold thee in youthful prime
like to a maned lion in Himalayan forests."

The basket drifted down the River Aswa until it was no longer seen by
that lotus-eyed damsel, and at length it reached the Jumna; the Jumna
gave it to the Ganges, and by that great and holy river it was borne
unto the country of Anga. . . . The child, lying in soft slumber, was
kept alive by reason of the virtues possessed by the celestial armour
and the ear-rings.

Now there was a woman of Anga who was named Radha, and she had peerless
beauty. Her husband was Shatananda, the charioteer. Both husband and
wife had

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

for long sorrowed greatly because that they could not obtain a son. One
day, however, their wish was gratified. It chanced that Radha went down
to the river bank, and she beheld the basket drifting on the waves. She
caused it to be brought ashore; and when it was uncovered, she gazed
with wonder upon a sleeping babe who was as fair as the morning sun. Her
heart was immediately filled with great gladness, and she cried out:
"The gods have heard me at length, and they have sent unto me a son." So
she adopted the babe and cherished him. And the years went past, and
Karna grew up and became a powerful youth and a mighty bowman.

Pritha, who was comely to behold, chose King Pandu at her swayamvara.
Trembling with love, she placed the flower garland upon his shoulders.

Madri came from the country of Madra <span
id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_217.md), and was black-eyed and
dusky-complexioned. She had been purchased by Bhishma for the king with
much gold, many jewels and elephants and horses, as was the marriage
custom among her people.

The glories of King Bharata's reign were revived by Pandu, who achieved
great conquests and extended his territory. He loved well to go
a-hunting, and at length he retired to the Himalaya mountains with his
two wives to pursue and slay deer. There, as fate had decreed, he met
with dire misfortune. One day he shot arrows at two deer which he beheld
sporting together; but they were, as he discovered to his sorrow, a holy
Brahman and his wife in animal guise. The sage was wounded mortally, and
ere he died he assumed his wonted form, and foretold that Pandu, whom he
cursed, would die in the arms of one of his wives.

The king was stricken with fear; he immediately took

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

vows of celibacy, and gave all his possessions to Brahmans; then he went
away to live in a solitary place with his two wives.

Some have told that Pandu never had children of his own, and that the
gods were the fathers of his wives' great sons. Pritha was mother of
Yudhishthira <span id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_218.md), son of Dharma, god
of justice, and of Bhima, son of Vayu, the wind god, and also of
Arjuna <span id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_219.md), son of mighty Indra,
monarch of heaven. Madri received from Pritha the charm which Durvasas
had given her, and she became the mother of Nakula and Sahadeva, whose
sires were the twin Aswins, sons of Surya, the sun god. These five
princes were known as the Pandava brothers.

King Pandu was followed by his doom. One day, as it chanced, he met with
Madri, his favourite wife; they wandered together in a forest, and when
he clasped her in his arms he immediately fell dead as the Brahman had
foretold.

His sons, the Pandava brothers, built his funeral pyre, so that his soul
might pass to heaven. Both Pritha and Madri desired to be burned with
him, and they debated together which of them should follow her lord to
the region of the dead.

Said Pritha: "I must go hence with my lord. I was his first wife and
chief rani. O Madri, yield me his body and rear our children together. O
let me achieve what must be achieved."

Madri said: "Speak not so, for I should be the chosen one. I was King
Pandu's favourite wife, and he died because that he loved me. O sister,
if I survived thee I should not be able to rear our children as thou
canst rear them. Do not refuse thy sanction to this which is dear unto
my heart."

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

So they held dispute, nor could agree; but the Brahmans, who heard them,
said that Madri must be burned with King Pandu, having been his
favourite wife. And so it came to pass that Madri laid herself on the
pyre, and she passed in flames with her beloved lord, that bull among
men.

Meanwhile King Pandu's blind brother, Dhritarashtra, had ascended the
throne to reign over the kingdom of Bharatavarsha, with Bhishma as his
regent, until the elder of the young princes should come of age.

Dhritarashtra had taken for wife fair Gándhári, daughter of the Rajah of
Gándhârá. When she was betrothed she went unto the king with eyes
blindfolded, and ever after-wards she so appeared in his presence. She
became the mother of a hundred sons, the eldest of whom was Duryodhana.
These were the princes who were named the Kauravas, after the country of
Kuru-jangala. <span id="fr_221"></span>[1](#fn_220.md)

The widowed Pritha returned to Hastinapur with her three sons and the
two sons of Madri also. When she told unto Dhritarashtra that Pandu his
brother had died, he wept and mourned greatly; then he bathed in holy
waters and poured forth the funeral oblation. The blind King gave his
protection to the five princes who were Pandu's heirs.

So the Pandavas and Kauravas were reared together in the royal palace at
Hastinapur. Nor was favour shown to one cousin more than another. The
young princes were trained to throw the stone and to cast the noose, and
they engaged lustily in wrestling bouts and practised

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

boxing. As they grew up they shared work with the king's men; they
marked the young calves, and every three years they counted and branded
the cattle. Yet, despite all that could be done, the two families lived
at enmity. Of all the young men Bhima <span
id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_221.md), of the Pandavas <span
id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_222.md), was the most powerful, and
Duryodhana <span id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_223.md), the leader of the
Kauravas, was jealous of him. Bhima was ever the victor in sports and
contests. The Kauravas could ill endure his triumphs, and at length they
plotted among themselves to accomplish his death.

It chanced that the young men had gone to dwell in a royal palace on the
banks of the Ganges. One day, when they feasted together in the manner
of warriors, Duryodhana put poison in the food of Bhima, who soon
afterwards fell into a deep swoon and seemed to be dead. Then Duryodhana
bound him hand and foot and cast him into the Ganges; his body was
swallowed by the waters.

But it was not fated that Bhima should thus perish. As his body sank
down, the fierce snakes, which are called Nagas, attacked him; but their
poison counter-acted the poison he had already swallowed, so that he
regained consciousness. Then, bursting his bonds, he scattered the
reptiles before him, and they fled in terror.

Bhima found that he had sunk down to the city of serpents, which is in
the underworld. Vasuki, king of the Nagas, having heard of his prowess,
hastened towards the young warrior, whom he desired greatly to behold.

Bhima was welcomed by Aryaka, the great grandsire of Pritha, who was a
dweller in the underworld. He

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

was loved by Vasuki, who, for Aryaka's sake, offered great gifts to
fearless Bhima. But Aryaka chose rather that the lad should be given a
draught of strength which contained the virtues of a thousand Nagas. By
the king of serpents was this great boon granted, and Bhima was
permitted to drain the bowl eight times. He immediately fell into a deep
slumber, which continued for the space of eight days. Then he awoke, and
the Nagas feasted him ere he returned again unto his mother and his
brethren, who were mourning for him the while. Thus it fell that Bhima
triumphed over Duryodhana, for ever afterwards he possessed the strength
of a mighty giant. He related unto his brothers all that had befallen
him, but they counselled him not to reveal his secret unto the Kauravas,
his cousins.

About this time the prudent Bhishma deemed that the young men should be
trained to bear arms; so he searched far and wide for a preceptor who
was at once a warrior and a scholar, a pious and lofty-minded man, and a
lover of truth. Such was Drona, the brave and god-adoring son of
Bharadwaja. He was well pleased to have care of the princes, and to give
them instruction worthy of their rank and martial origin.

Drona had no mother: his miraculous birth was accomplished by a
beautiful nymph, and his sire was Bharadwaja, a most pious Brahman. Of
similar origin was Drupada <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_224.md), son of
a rajah named Prishata <span id="fr_226"></span>[2](#fn_225.md). Drona and
Drupada were reared together like brothers by the wise Bharadwaja, and
it was the hope of both sires that their sons would repeat their own
lifelong friendship. But when, after happy youth, they grew into
manhood, fate parted them. The rajah retired from the throne, and

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Drupada ruled the
kingdom of Panchala <span id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_226.md). Bharadwaja
died soon afterwards, and Drona married a wife named Kripa, who became
the mother of his son Ashwatthama <span id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_227.md).
The child was so named because at birth he uttered a cry like to the
neighing of a horse. Drona devoted himself to rearing his son, while he
accumulated the wisdom of the sages and performed sacred rites with
pious mind like to his holy sire.

When the sage Jamadagni, son of Bhrigu, closed his career, he bestowed
his great wealth on the sons of Brahmans. Drona received heavenly
weapons and power to wield them. Then he bethought him to visit Drupada,
the friend of his youth, and share his inheritance with him. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_228.md)

Drona stood before the rajah and exclaimed: "Behold thy friend."

But Drupada frowned; his eyes reddened with anger, and for a while he
sat in silence. At length he spoke haughtily and said:

"Brahman, it is nor wise nor fitting that thou shouldst call me friend.
What friendship can there be between a luckless beggar and a mighty
rajah? . . . I grant that in youth such a bond united us, one to
another, but it has wasted away with the years. Do not think that the
friendship of youth endures for ever in human hearts; it is weakened by
time, and pride plucks it from one's bosom. Friendship can exist only
between equals as we two once were, but no longer chance to be. Hear and
know! Rich and poor, wise and ignorant, warriors and cowards, can never
be friends; it is for those who are of equal station to exercise mutual
esteem. . . . Say, can a

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

Brahman respect one who is ignorant of the Vedas? Can a warrior do other
than despise one who cannot go forth to battle in his rumbling chariot?
Say, can a monarch condescend to one who is far beneath him? . . .
Begone, then, thou dreamer! Forget the days and the thoughts of the
past. . . . I know thee not. . . ."

Drona heard the harsh words of his old friend with mute amaze. For a
moment he paused. Then abruptly he turned away, nor spake he in reply.
His heart burned with indignation as he hastened out of the city.

In time he reached the city of Hastinapur, and Bhishma bade him welcome.
When Drona undertook the training of the princes he said: "I will do as
is thy desire, O Bhishma, but on condition that when the young men are
become complete warriors they will help me to fight against mine enemy,
Drupada, the Rajah of Panchala."

Bhishma gave willing consent to this condition. Thereafter Drona abode
with his wife in the royal palace, and his son Ashwatthama was trained
with the Pandavas and Kauravas. He became the family priest as well as
the instructor of the princes. And ere long the young men were
accomplished warriors, and deeply learned in wisdom and in goodness.

Drona took most delight in the Pandavas. Yudhishthira was trained as a
spearman, but he was more renowned as a scholar than for feats of arms.
Arjuna surpassed all others in warrior skill; he was of noble bearing,
and none like him could ride the steed, guide the elephant, or drive the
rattling chariot, nor could any other prince withstand his battle charge
or oppose him in single combat. He was unequalled with javelin or dart,
with battleaxe or mace, and he became the most famous archer of his

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

day. Strong Bhima learned to wield the club, Nakula acquired the secret
of taming steeds, and Sahadeva became a mighty swordsman, and acquired
great knowledge of astronomy.

Drona trained the Kauravas with diligence also, as well as his own son,
who was wise and brave; but among all his pupils he loved Arjuna best,
for he was the most modest and the most perfect, the most fearless, and
yet the most obedient to his preceptor.

Duryodhana of the Kauravas was jealous of all the Pandavas, and
especially of Arjuna.

The fame of Drona as a preceptor was spread far and wide, and the sons
of many rajahs and warriors hastened to Hastinapur to be instructed by
him. All were welcomed save one, and he was the son of the rajah of the
robber Bhils. This young man pleaded that he might be trained as an
archer, but without avail. Drona said: "Are not the Bhils highwaymen and
cattle-lifters? It would be a sin, indeed, to impart unto one of them
great knowledge in the use of weapons."

When he heard these words, the rajah's son was stricken with grief, and
he turned homeward. But he resolved to become an accomplished warrior.
So he fashioned a clay image of Drona and worshipped it, and wielded the
bow before it until his fame as an archer was noised abroad.

One day Drona went forth with the princes to hunt in the Bhil kingdom.
Their dog ran through the woods, and it beheld the dark son of the rajah
of the Bhils and barked at him. Desiring to display his skill, the young
man shot seven arrows into the dog's mouth ere it could be closed, and,
moaning and bleeding, the animal returned thus to the princes.

Wondering greatly, the princes searched for the greatly-skilled

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

archer, and found him busy with his how. They spoke, saying: "Who art
thou?" And the Bhil made answer: "I am a pupil of Drona."

When Drona was brought to the place, the young man kissed his feet.

Said the wise preceptor: "If thou art my pupil, I must receive my
reward."

The young man made answer: "Command me, and I will give thee whatsoever
thou dost desire."

Said Drona: "I should like to have the thumb of thy right hand."

The faithful prince of the Bhils did not hesitate to obey his preceptor;
with a cheerful face he severed his thumb from his right hand and gave
it to Drona.

After his wound had healed, the young man began to draw his bow with his
middle fingers, but found that he had lost his surpassing skill, whereat
Arjuna was made happy.

All the other Bhil warriors who trained in archery followed the prince's
example and drew the how with their middle fingers, and this custom
prevailed ever afterwards amongst the tribe.

Now when all the Hastinapur princes had become expert warriors, Drona
addressed the blind king, as he sat among his counsellors, and said: "O
mighty rajah, thy sons and the sons of thy brother Pandu have now
attained surpassing skill in arms, and they are fit to enter the
battlefield."

Said the king, who was well pleased: "So thy task is finished, O noble
son of Bharadwaja? Let now a place be made ready, in accordance with thy
desire, so that the princes may display their martial skill in the
presence of their peers and the common people."

Then Drona, accompanied by Vidura, the king's

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

brother, made choice of a wide and level plain on which the Pandavas and
Kauravas might perform their mighty feats.

So be it next told of the great tournament on the plain, and of the
coming of illustrious Karna.
