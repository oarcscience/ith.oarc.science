WHEN it was told to the Pandava brethren that their camp had been raided
in darkness by the bloodthirsty Aswatthaman, Yudhishthira exclaimed:
"Alas! sorrow upon sorrow crowds upon us, and now the greatest sorrow of
all hath fallen. Draupadi mourns the death of her brother and her five
sons, and I rear she will perish with grief."

Draupadi came before her husbands and, weeping bitterly, said: "For
thirteen cruel years you have endured shame and exile so that your
children might prosper. But now that they are all slain, can you desire
to have power and kingdom?"

Said Krishna: "O daughter of a rajah, is thy grief so great as is
Pritha's and Gandhari's, and as great as those who lament the loss or
their husbands on the battlefield? Thou hast less cause than others to
wail now."

Draupadi was soothed somewhat, but she turned to

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhima and said:
"If thou wilt not bring to me the head of Aswatthaman, I will never
again look upon thy face."

Said Yudhishthira: "Aswatthaman is a Brahman, and Vishnu, the greatest
of the gods, will punish him if he hath done wrong. If we should slay
him now, O Draupadi, thy sons and thy brother and thy sire would not be
restored unto thee."

Draupadi said: "So be it. But Aswatthaman hath a great jewel which
gleams in darkness. Let it be taken from him, for it is as dear unto him
as his life."

Then Arjuna went in pursuit of Aswatthaman and found him, and returned
with the jewel.

To the battlefield came blind old Dhritarashtra, mourning the death of
his hundred sons. And with the weeping maharajah were Queen Gandhari and
the wives of the Kaurava princes, who sorrowed aloud. Wives wept for
their husbands, their children wailed beside them, and mothers moaned
for their sons. Bitter was the anguish of tender-hearted women, and the
air was filled with wailing on that blood-red plain of Kurukshetra.

When Queen Gandhari beheld the Pandavas she cried out: "The smell of
Duryodhana is upon you all."

Now Dhritarashtra plotted in his weak mind to crush the head of Bhima,
the slayer of Duryodhana. When he embraced Yudhishthira he said: "Where
is Bhima?" and they placed before him an image of the strong Pandava.
Dhritarashtra put forth his arms, and he crushed the image in his
embrace and fell back fainting. Then he wailed: "Alas! Bhima was as a
son unto me. Although I have slain him, the dead cannot return." Well
pleased was the maharajah when it was told to him that Bhima still
lived; and he embraced his son's

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

slayer tenderly and with forgiveness, saying: "I have no children now
save the sons of Pandu, my brother."

Pritha rejoiced to meet her five sons, and she embraced them one by one.
Then she went towards the sorrowing Draupadi, who fainted in her arms.
Thereafter they wept together for the dead.

The bodies of the slain rajahs and princes were collected together, and
wrapped in perfumed linen and laid each upon a funeral pyre and burned,
and the first pyre which was kindled was that of Duryodhana. The
Pandavas mourned for their kinsmen. Then they bathed in the holy Ganges,
and took up water and sprinkled it in the name of each dead hero.
Yudhishthira poured out the oblation for Karna, his brother, and he gave
great gifts to his widows and his children. Thereafter all the remaining
bodies of the slain were burned on the battlefield. <span
id="fr_285"></span>[1](#fn_284.md)

Yudhishthira was proclaimed rajah in the city of Hastinapur, and he wore
the great jewel in his crown. A great sacrifice was offered up, and
Dhaumya, the family priest of the Pandavas, poured the Homa offering to
the gods on the sacred fire. Yudhishthira and Draupadi were anointed
with holy water.

In the days that followed, Yudhishthira lamented over the carnage of the
great war, nor could he be comforted. At length Vyasa, the sage,
appeared before him and advised that he should perform the horse
sacrifice to atone for his sins.

Then search was made for a moon-white horse with yellow tail and one
black ear, and when it was found a plate of gold, inscribed with the
name of Yudhishthira, was tied upon its forehead. Thereafter the horse
was

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

let loose, and was allowed to wander wheresoever it desired. A great
army, which was led by Arjuna, followed the horse.

Now it was the custom in those days that when the sacred horse entered a
raj <span id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_285.md), that raj was proclaimed to be
subject to the king who performed the ceremony. And if any ruler
detained the horse, he was compelled to fight with the army which
followed the wandering animal. Should he be overcome in battle, the
opposing rajah immediately joined forces with those of the conqueror,
and followed the horse from kingdom to kingdom. For a whole year the
animal was allowed to wander thus.

The horse was let loose on the night of full moon in the month of
Choitro. <span id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_286.md)

Arjuna met with many adventures. He fought against a rajah and the son
of a rajah, who had a thousand wives in the country of Malwa, and
defeated them. But Agni, who had married a daughter of the rajah, came
to rescue his kin. He fought against Arjuna with fire, but Arjuna shot
celestial arrows which produced water. Then the god made peace, and the
rajah who had detained the horse went away with Arjuna. Thereafter the
horse came to a rock which was the girl-wife of a Rishi who had been
thus transformed because of her wickedness. "So will you remain," her
husband had said, "until Yudhishthira performs the Aswa-medha ceremony."
The horse was unable to leave the rock. Then Arjuna touched the rock,
which immediately became a woman, and the horse was set free.

In time the horse entered the land of Amazons, and the queen detained
it, and came forth with her women warriors to fight against Arjuna, who,
however, made peace with them and went upon his way. Thereafter

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

the holy steed reached a strange country where men and women and horses
and cows and goats grew upon mighty trees like to fruit, and came to
maturity and died each day. The rajah came against Arjuna, but was
defeated. Then all the army fled to the islands of the sea, for they
were Daityas, and Arjuna plundered their dwellings and obtained much
treasure.

Once the horse entered a pond, and was cursed by the goddess Parvati,
and it became a mare; it entered another pond and became a lion, owing
to a Brahman's spell.

In the kingdom of Manipura the horse was seized, and soldiers armed with
fire weapons were ready to fight against the Pandavas and their allies.
But when the rajah, whose name was Babhru-váhana, discovered that the
horse bore the name of Yudhishthira, he said: "Arjuna is my sire;" and
he went forth and made obeisance, and put his head under the foot of the
Pandava hero. But Arjuna spurned him, saying: "If I were thy sire, thou
wouldst have no fear of me."

Then the rajah challenged Arjuna to battle, and was victorious on that
day. <span id="fr_288"></span>[1](#fn_287.md) He took all the great men
prisoners, and he severed Arjuna's head from his body with a
crescent-bladed arrow. The rajah's mother, Chitrangada, was stricken
with sorrow, as was also Ulupi, the daughter of Vasuka, the king of
serpents, who had borne a son to Arjuna. But Ulupi remembered that her
sire possessed a magic jewel which had power to restore a dead man to
life, and she sent the rajah of Manipura to obtain it from the
underworld. But the Nagas refused to give up the jewel, whereupon
Arjuna's mighty

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

son fought against them with arrows which were transformed into
peacocks; and the peacocks devoured the serpents. Then the Naga king
delivered up the magic jewel, and the rajah returned with it. He touched
the body of Arjuna with the jewel, and the hero came to life again, and
all his wounds were healed. When he departed from Manipura city the
rajah, his son, accompanied him.

So from kingdom to kingdom the horse wandered while the army followed,
until a year had expired. Then it returned to Hastinapur.

Yudhishthira had meantime lived a life of purity and self-restraint.
Each night he lay upon the ground, and always slept within the city.
Beside him lay Draupadi, and a naked sword was ever betwixt them.

Great were the rejoicings of the people when the horse came back: they
made glad holiday, and went forth to welcome the army with gifts of fine
raiment and jewels and flowers. Money was scattered in the streets, and
the poor were made happy, being thus relieved generously in their need.

Yudhishthira embraced Arjuna and kissed him and wept tears of gladness,
and welcomed Arjuna's son, Babhru-váhana, Rajah of Manipura, and also
the other rajahs who had followed the sacred horse.

Twelve days after the return of Arjuna, and on the day when Magha's full
moon marked the close of the winter season, the people assembled in
great multitudes from far and near to share Yudhishthira's generous
hospitality and witness the Aswa-medha ceremony, which was held upon a
green and level portion of consecrated ground. Stately pavilions,
glittering with jewels and gold, had been erected for the royal guests,
and there were humbler places for the Brahmans. In thrones of

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

gold sat Maharajah Dhritarashtra and Rajah Yudhishthira, and the other
rajahs had thrones of sandalwood and gold. The royal ladies were ranged
together in their appointed places. Wise Vyasa was there, and he
directed the ceremony. And Krishna, the holy one, was there also.

When all the guests were assembled, Yudhishthira and Draupadi bathed
together in the sacred waters of the Ganges. Then a portion of ground
was measured out, and Yudhishthira ploughed it with a golden plough.
Draupadi followed him, and sowed the seeds of every kind which is sown
in the kingdom, while all the women and the Brahmans chanted holy
mantras. Then a golden altar was erected with four broad layers of
golden bricks, and stakes of sacred wood from the forest and from
Himalaya, and it was canopied and winged with gold-brocaded silk.

Then eight pits were dug for Homa <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_288.md)
of milk and butter to be made ready for the sacrificial fire, and in
skins were wrapped up portions of every kind of vegetable and curative
herb which grew in the kingdom, and these were placed in the Homa pits.

On the ground there were numerous sacrificial stakes, to which were tied
countless animals--bulls and buffaloes and steeds, wild beasts from
forest and mountain and cave, birds of every kind, fishes from river and
lake, and even insects.

The priests offered up animals in sacrifice to each celestial power, and
the feasting was beheld by sacred beings. The Gandharvas sang, and the
Apsaras, whom the Gandharvas wooed, danced like sunbeams on the grass.
Messengers of the gods were also gathered there, and Vyasa and his
disciples chanted mantras to celestial music. The people lifted up their
voices at the sound

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

of rain drum and the blast of the rain trumpet. Then bright was the
lustre of Yudhishthira's fame.

When all the kings and royal ladies and sages took their places to be
blessed by the horse sacrifice, Yudhishthira sat on his throne, and in
his hand he held the horn of a stag.

Vyasa sent four-and-sixty rajahs with their wives to draw water from the
holy Ganges. Many musicians went with them beating drums and blowing
trumpets and playing sweet instruments, and girls danced in front, going
and returning. And all the rajahs and their wives were given splendid
raiment by Yudhishthira, and necklaces of jewels also, and he put
betelnut in their mouths one by one. To the Brahmans were gifted much
gold and many jewels, and elephants, horses, and kine, and they were
well pleased.

Yudhishthira then sat naked in his throne, and each one who had drawn
holy water poured a quantity over his head; and they poured what
remained over the head of the sacred white horse.

Nákula held the horse's head, and said: "The horse speaketh."

Those who were about him asked in loud voices: "What doth the horse
reveal?"

Said Nákula: "Thus speaketh the horse--'In other such ceremonies the
horse which is sacrificed departs unto Swarga <span
id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_289.md), but I shall rise far above Swarga,
because that Krishna is here'."

Then Dhaumya, having washed the horse, gave a scimitar to Bhima with
which to strike off the head at a single blow. But ere this was done,
Dhaumya pressed an ear of the holy animal, and milk flowed forth. Then
he said to Bhima: "Pure indeed is the horse; verily the

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

gods will accept the sacrifice. Strike now, O strong one."

Bhima raised the scimitar and severed the head, which immediately
ascended unto heaven and vanished from before the eyes of all. Great was
the wonder and the joy of the assembled multitude.

Krishna and other rajahs and sages then cut open the horse's body, from
which a bright light issued forth. They found that the animal was pure,
and Krishna said unto Yudhishthira: "This, thy sacrifice, is acceptable
unto Vishnu."

Draupadi was made Queen of the Sacrifice, and mantras were chanted, and
she was adored and given rich offerings, because of her virtue and her
wisdom.

The body of the slain steed was divided, and the flesh gave forth the
odour of camphor. Priests lifted portions in their ladles and placed
these on the sacrificial fire, and they made Soma. And Rajah
Yudhishthira and all his brethren stood in the sin-cleansing smoke and
breathed its fragrance.

Dhaumya cried out, as he laid a piece of flesh on the altar fire: "O
Indra, accept thou this flesh which hath turned to camphor."

When he had uttered these words, Indra, accompanied by many gods,
appeared before the people, who made obeisance with fear and secret joy.
Indra took from Vyasa portions of the flesh and gave these to each of
the gods. Then he vanished from sight with all his companions.

Vyasa blessed Yudhishthira, and Krishna embraced him.

Said Krishna: "Thy fame will endure for ever." Yudhishthira made answer:
"Unto thee do I owe all these blessings."

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

Thereafter Krishna and the rajahs poured holy water over the heads of
Yudhishthira and Draupadi.

All the fragments of the herbs which had been provided for Homa were
then ground into powder. And Yudhishthira gave balls of the powder to
each one present, so that they might eat of the sacred herbs and share
in the blessings of the Aswa-medha. He ate his own portion last of all.
The fragments of the offerings which remained were burnt on the altar.

Then Pritha and all the maidens who were with her made merry, while the
musicians played gladsome airs.

Yudhishthira distributed more gifts. Unto Vyasa he assigned an estate,
and bestowed upon the Brahmans who officiated many animals and pearls
and slaves. To the rajahs he gave war elephants and steeds and money,
and to the rajahs' wives bridal-night gifts of raiment and jewels and
gold.

Bhima feasted all the Brahmans, and Yudhishthira wept as he bade
farewell to Krishna, his friend in peace and in war, who departed in his
chariot unto sea-washed Dwaraka.

There was prosperity in the kingdom under Yudhishthira's wise and just
government; but blind old Dhritarashtra never ceased to mourn the death
of Duryodhana, his first-born, and at length he retired to live in a
humble dwelling in the jungle. With him went Queen Gandhari, and Pritha,
the mother of the Pandavas, and Vidura, and others who were of great
age.

Years went past, and a day came when Yudhishthira and his brethren and
their wife Draupadi journeyed to the dwelling-place of their elders.
They found them all there save Vidura, who had departed to a sacred
place on the banks of the Ganges to undergo penance and wait for the
coming of Yama, god of the dead. Then all the

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

kinsfolk, young and old, went forth to find Vidura; but when they came
to him he was wasted with hunger and great age, nor could he speak unto
them. They waited beside him until he died, and then they mourned
together. This new sorrow awakened old-time grief, and they spoke of all
those who had fallen in the great war. Fathers and mothers lamented for
their sons, and wives for their husbands. . . .

While they wept and moaned together, the great sage Vyasa came nigh and
spoke, saying: "Verily, I will soothe all your sorrows. . . . Let each
one bathe at sunset in the holy waters of the Ganges, and when night
falls your lost ones will return to you once again."

Then they all sat waiting on the river bank until evening came on.
Slowly passed the day; it seemed to be as long as a year.

At length the sun went down, and they chanted mantras and went into the
Ganges. Vyasa bathed beside the old Maharajah Dhritarashtra and
Yudhishthira. . . . Then all came out and stood on the bank.

Suddenly the waters began to heave and foam, and Vyasa muttered holy
words and called out the names of the dead one by one. . . . Soon all
the heroes who had been slain arose one by one. In chariots they came,
and on horseback and riding upon lordly elephants. They all uttered
triumphant cries; drums were sounded and trumpets were blown; and it
seemed as if the armies of the Pandavas and Kauravas were once again
assembled for battle, for they swept over the river like a mighty
tempest.

Many of the onlookers trembled with fear, until they beheld Bhishma and
Drona, clad in armour, standing aloft in their chariots in splendour and
in pride; then came Arjuna's son, the noble Abhimanyu, and Bhima's
Asura,

THE RETURN OF THE HEROES SLAIN IN BATTLE  
*From the painting by Warwick Goble*.  

 

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

son. Soon Gandhari beheld Duryodhana and all his brethren, while Pritha
looked with glad eyes upon Karna, and Draupadi welcomed her brother
Dhrishta-dyumna and her five children who had all been slain by vengeful
Aswatthaman. All the warriors who had fallen in battle returned again on
that night of wonder.

With the host came minstrels who sang of the deeds of the heroes, and
beautiful girls who danced before them. All strife had ended between
kinsmen and old-time rivals; in death there was peace and sweet
companionship.

The ghostly warriors crossed the Ganges and were welcomed by those who
waited on the bank around Vyasa. It was a night of supreme and
heart-stirring gladness. Fathers and mothers found their sons, widows
clung to their husbands, sisters embraced their brothers, and all wept
tears of joy. The elders who were living conversed with those who were
dead; the burdens of grief and despair fell from all hearts after lone
years of mourning; the past was suddenly forgotten in the rapture of
beholding those who had died.

Swiftly passed the night as if it had endured but for an hour. Then when
dawn began to break, the dead men returned to their chariots and their
horses and their elephants and bade farewells. . . .

Vyasa spoke to the widows and said that those of them who desired to be
with their husbands could depart with them. Then the Kaurava princesses
and other high- born ladies, who never ceased to mourn for their own,
kissed the feet of the Maharajah Dhritarashtra and Queen Gandhari and
plunged into the Ganges with the departing hosts. . . . Vyasa chanted
mantras, and all the drowned widows were transported to heaven with
their husbands. . . .

The Pandavas returned to Hastinapur, and when two years had gone past a
new sorrow fell upon them. One

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

day Narada, the sage, stood before Yudhishthira and told that a great
fire had swept through the jungle, and that Dhritarashtra, and Gandhari,
and Pritha, and all who were with them, had perished.

Soon afterwards the Pandavas came to know, by reason of dread omens
which appeared, that a great calamity was drawing nigh, but no man could
tell what it was or when it would take place.

Ere long it became known that the city of Dwaraka was doomed to be
destroyed. A horror in human shape was beheld in the night; it was
coloured yellow and black, its head was bald and its limbs misshapen,
and men said it was Yama, god of the dead. . . . Visions of headless men
contending in battle were beheld at sunset. . . . The moon was eclipsed,
a dread tempest ravaged the land, and a plague of rats afflicted the
city.

Krishna forbade all the people, on pain of death, to drink wine, and
commanded them to perform devotions on the seashore. . . .

Then the night was haunted by a black woman with yellow teeth who
grinned horribly at house doors. All the inhabitants of the city were
stricken with terror. . . . Evil spirits came also and robbed the jewels
of the women and the weapons of the men. . . . At length the
chakra <span id="fr_291"></span>[1](#fn_290.md) of Krishna went up to
heaven, and his chariot and horses followed it. . . . The end of the
Yádavas was not afar off, and the day came when Apsaras called out of
heaven: "Depart from hence," and all the people heard them.

When the people gathered on the seashore they held a feast, and being
allowed to drink wine for one day, they drank heavily and began to
quarrel. At length Satyaki slew Kritavarman, who had gone to the Pandava
camp with Drona's son on the night of slaughter. Then

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kritavarman's
friends killed Satyaki and one of Krishna's sons. Krishna slew the
rebels, but he could not quell the tumult and the fighting which ensued;
fathers slew their sons, and sons their fathers, and kinsmen contended
fiercely against kinsmen.

Then Krishna and Balarama left the city, and both died in the jungle.
From Balarama's mouth issued a mighty snake, for he was the incarnation
of the world serpent. . . . Krishna was mistaken for a gazelle by a
hunter, who shot an arrow which pierced his foot at the only spot where
he could be mortally wounded. He then departed to his heaven, which is
called Goloka.

Ere Krishna had left Dwaraka he caused messengers to hasten for Arjuna,
who came speedily, to find the women wailing for the dead. Then
Vasudeva, father of Krishna, died, and Arjuna laid the body of the old
man upon the pyre, and he was burned with four of his widows, who no
longer desired to live. The bodies of Krishna and Balarama were cremated
also.

Arjuna then set forth towards Indra-prastha with a remnant of the
people; and when they had left Dwaraka, the sea rose up and swallowed
the whole city, with those who had refused to depart from it. . . . Such
was the end of the power of the Yadavas.

Deep gloom fell upon the Pandavas after this, and Vyasa, the sage,
appeared before them, and revealed that their time had come to depart
from the world.

Then Yudhishthira divided the kingdom. He made Parikshit, son of
Abhimanyu, Rajah of Hastinapur; and Yuyutsu, the half-brother of
Duryodhana, who had joined the Pandava army on the first day of the
great war, was made Rajah of Hastinapur. He counselled them to live at
peace one with another.

The Pandavas afterwards cast off their royal garments

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

and their jewels and put on the garb of hermits, and the bright-eyed and
faithful Draupadi did likewise. Yudhishthira departed first of all, and
his brethren walked behind him one by one, and Draupadi went last of
all, followed by a hound. They all walked towards the rising sun, and by
the long circuitous path which leads to Mount Meru, through forests and
over streams and across the burning plains, never again to return.

One by one they fell by the way, all save Yudhishthira. Draupadi was the
first to sink down, and Bhima cried: "Why hath she fallen who hath never
done wrong?"

Said Yudhishthira: "Her heart was bound up in Arjuna, and she hath her
reward."

Sahadeva was next to fall, and then Nakula. At length Yudhishthira heard
the voice of Bhima crying in distress: "Lo! now the noble Arjuna hath
fallen. What sin hath he committed?"

Said Yudhishthira: "He boasted confidently that he could destroy all his
enemies in one day, and because he failed in his vow he hath fallen by
the way."

The two surviving brothers walked on in silence; but the time came when
mighty Bhima sank down. He cried: "O Yudhishthira say, if thou canst
tell, why I have fallen now.

Said Yudhishthira: "O wolf-bellied one, because of thy cursing and
gluttony and thy pride thou hast fallen by the way."

Yudhishthira walked on, calm and unmoved, followed by his faithful
hound. When he drew nigh to sacred Mount Meru, the world-spine, Indra,
king of the gods, carne forth to welcome him, saying: "Ascend, O
resolute prince."

Said Yudhishthira: "Let my brethren who have fallen

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

by the way come with me also. I cannot enter heaven without them, O king
of the gods. Let the fair and gentle princess come too; Draupadi hath
been a faithful wife, and is worthy of bliss. Hear my prayer, O Indra,
and have mercy."

Said Indra: "Thy brethren and Draupadi have gone before thee."

Then Yudhishthira pleaded that his faithful hound should enter heaven
also; but Indra said: "Heaven is no place for those who are followed by
hounds. Knowest thou not that demons rob religious ordinances of their
virtues when dogs are nigh?"

Said Yudhishthira: "No evil can come from the noble. I cannot have joy
if I desert this faithful friend."

Indra said: "Thou didst leave behind thy brethren and Draupadi. Why,
therefore, canst thou not abandon thine hound?"

Said Yudhishthira: "I have no power to bring back to life those who have
fallen by the way: there can be no abandonment of the dead."

As he spake, the hound was transformed, and behold Dharma, god of
justice, stood by the rajah's side.

Dharma said: "O Yudhishthira, thou art indeed mine own son. Thou wouldst
not abandon me, thy hound, because that I was faithful unto thee. Thine
equal cannot he found in heaven."

Then Yudhishthira was transported to the city of eternal bliss, and
there he beheld Duryodhana seated upon a throne. All the Kauravas were
in heaven also, but the rajah could not find his brethren or fair
Draupadi.

Said Indra: "Here thou shalt dwell, O Yudhishthira, in eternal bliss.
Forget all earthly ties and attain to perfection; thy brethren have
fallen short, therefore they sank by the way."

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

Yudhishthira said: "I cannot remain here with the Kauravas who have done
me great wrong. Where my brethren are, there would I be also with our
wife Draupadi."

Then a celestial being conducted Yudhishthira to the abode of his
brethren and the Princess of Panchala. He entered the forest of the
nether regions, where the leaves were like to sharp weapons and the path
was covered with knives. Darkness hung heavily, and the way was miry
with blood and strewn with foul and mutilated corpses. Shapes of horror
flitted round about like to shadows; fierce birds of prey feasted upon
human flesh. The damned were burning in everlasting fires, and the air
reeked with foul odours. A boiling river went past, and Yudhishthira saw
the place of torture with thorns, and the desert of fiery sand: he gazed
mutely upon each horror that was unfolded before his eyes.

Fain would Yudhishthira have turned back, but he heard in the darkness
the voices of his brethren and Draupadi bidding him to stay a little
while to comfort them while they suffered torment.

Then Yudhishthira said to the celestial being: "Depart now from me, for
I must remain here to assuage the sufferings of my brethren and
Draupadi."

As he spake the gods appeared, and the scene of horror vanished from
before the eyes of Yudhishthira, for it was an illusion conjured up to
test his constancy.

Then Yudhishthira was led to the heavenly Ganges, and having bathed in
its sacred waters, he cast off his mortal body and became a celestial.
Then, rejoicing, he entered Swarga, the celestial city of Indra, and was
welcomed by Krishna in all his divine glory, and by his brethren and by
Draupadi, and all whom he had loved upon earth.

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

Indra spoke and said: "This is the beautiful and immortal one, who
sprang from the altar to be thy wife, and these bright beings are her
five children. Here is Dhritarashtra, who is now the king of the
Gandharvas; there is Karna, son of Surya, the peerless archer who was
slain by Arjuna. Here cometh towards thee Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna; he
is now the star-bright companion of the lord of night. . . . Here are
Pandu, thy sire, and Pritha, thy mother, now united in heaven. Behold!
also, Yudhishthira, the wise Bhishma, whose place is with the Vasus
round my throne: Drona sits with Dharma, god of wisdom. Here are all the
peerless warriors who fell in battle and have won heaven by their valour
and their constancy. So may all mortals rise to eternal bliss, casting
off their mortal bodies and entering by the shining door of the
celestial city, by doing kindly deeds, by uttering gentle words, and by
enduring all suffering with patience. The holy life is prepared for all
the sons of men."

Thus ends sublimely the story of the Great War of the Bharatas.
