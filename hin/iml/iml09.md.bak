THE gods are the Suras and the demons the Asuras or "non-gods". This
distinction, however, did not obtain in the early Vedic period.
Originally the deities, and especially Varuna and Mitra, were called
Asuras, but in the later part of *Rigveda* the term is applied chiefly
to the enemies of the gods. In the *Atharvaveda*, as in subsequent Epic
literature, the Asuras are simply demons and giants and goblins.

No conclusive explanation can be offered as to how this remarkable
change took place in the course of the centuries embraced by the Vedic
period. It may have been due primarily to sectarian strife between the
religious teachers of those tribes which had been influenced by
Babylonian modes of thought and those which clung tenaciously to the
forms of primitive Aryan nature worship, and perhaps also the worship of
ancestors (Pitris). In the old Persian language, which, like Greek,
places

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "h" before a vowel
where "s" is used in Sanskrit, Ahura (= Asura) signifies "god". The
Zoroastrian chief god is called Ahura-Mazda, "the wise Lord", as Varuna
is addressed in early Rigvedic hymns, "wise Asura and King", and "the
all-knowing Asura who established the heavens and fixed the limits of
the earth". On the other hand "daeva" in the Iranian dialect, which is
cognate with Sanskrit "deva", "god", came to mean "demon". "Asura" is
derived from the root "asu", which signifies "the air of life", and
"deva" from "div", "to shine", or "deiwo", "heavenly".

The view has been urged that the revolt against "Asura" in India was due
to the hatred cherished towards the Persians who had become subject to
the Assyrians, the worshippers of Ashur. It was originally based on the
assumption that Assyrian aggression caused the migration of Aryan tribes
towards India. Subsequent research, however, has tended to dispel this
theory. It has been found, for instance, that Aryans were associated
with the Kassites who overthrew the Hammurabi dynasty of Babylon prior
to the invasion of the Punjab, and that the Assyrians were for a period
vassals of the Mitanni kings, who had Aryan names and worshipped Indra,
Varuna, and Mithra in Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. The weak point in the
Ashur-Asura theory is that it throws no light on the process which
caused the Persian "daeva" to be applied to demons instead of to gods.
How the gods of the Indian Aryans became the demons of Persia and the
demons of Persia became the gods of India is a problem for which a
solution has yet to be found.

The expository and speculative books of the priests--the *Brahmanas* and
*Upanishads*--which are attached to the Vedic hymns, do not help us
greatly in accounting for

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

the change. We read that "the gods and Asuras contended together, and
that the former, being less numerous than the latter, took some bricks,
and placing them in a proper position to receive the sacrificial fire,
with the formula, 'Thou art a multiplier', they became numerous". <span
id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_112.md)

In one of the Brahmanas we are informed:

"The Asuras performed at the sacrifice all that the Devas performed. The
Asuras became thus of equal power with the Devas, and did not yet yield
to them. Thereupon the Devas had a vision of the 'silent praise'. The
Asuras, not knowing it, did not perform the 'silent praise'. This
'silent praise' is the latent essence of the hymns. Till then, whatever
weapons the Devas used against the Asuras, the Asuras used in revenge
against them; but when the Devas had a vision of the 'silent praise' and
raised it as a weapon, the Asuras did not comprehend it. With it the
Devas aimed a blow at the Asuras, and defeated them, for they had no
comprehension of this weapon. Thereupon the Devas became masters of the
Asuras. He who has such a knowledge becomes master of his enemy,
adversary, and hater." <span id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_113.md)

This explanation is but an echo of the Indra-Vritra combat. Another
statement is to the effect that "the Devas gave up falsehood and adopted
truth, while the Asuras gave up truth and adopted falsehood". Further,
we learn that when a sacrifice was performed the Asuras put the
offerings into their own mouths, while the Suras (gods) gave the
offerings they received to one another.

The Asuras became completely identified with the demons and giants; they
symbolized evil, darkness, and drought. In Epic literature we read that
"in ancient times the gods and Asuras were very active in destroying one
another. And the terrible Asuras always succeeded in defeating the
gods." . . . Indra goes forth with

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

his thunderbolt against Kesin, the leader of the Asuras, who wielded a
great mace; this mace the demon hurled against the god, but Indra "cut
it up in its course with his thunderbolt. Then Kesin, furious with rage,
hurled a huge mass of rock at him." Indra "of a hundred sacrifices rent
it asunder with his thunderbolt, and it fell down upon the ground. And
Kesin himself was wounded by that falling mass of rock. <span
id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_114.md) Thus sorely afflicted he fled". Indra
rescues a beautiful lady who had been seized by the Asura, and she
informs the god that her sister had previously fallen a victim to the
demon. . . . <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_115.md)

The Asuras obstructed sacrifices; they were ever hovering round altars
to discover if rites were properly performed; if a priest did not
perform a ceremony in orthodox fashion, the sacrifice was of no avail,
because the Asuras devoured it; if a man neglected a part of a
ceremonial performance, a demon might take possession of him and
accomplish his ruin.

One of the terrible Asuras is the demon Rahu, who causes eclipses by
swallowing the sun and the moon, like the Chinese dragon, the wolf
Managarm of Teutonic mythology, and the Grecian demons who devour
Helena, the sun maiden, sister of the twin Dioscuri. In the Vedic period
Rahu was represented by the demon Svarbhanu.

The Asuras of Ocean are the Daityas and Danavas, the descendants of the
chaos hags Diti and Danu, and Kasyapa, a superhuman sage. These are the
giants and demons who fought against the gods like the Titans, the Irish
Fomorians, and the Norse Jotuns. Indra confined them in this region,
which is called Patala, and they remain

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

there "afflicted by Time ", <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_116.md) and
subject to the sway of Varuna. Like the Norse giants, they will be let
loose to take part in the "Last Battle". An "Asura fire" burns
constantly in Patala, fed by water; it is "bound and confined", but
cannot be extinguished; when the end of all comes, it will burst forth
and burn up the three worlds. <span id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_117.md) In
Teutonic mythology the Universe is similarly doomed to be consumed by
fire at Ragnarok, "the Dusk of the Gods".

The abodes of these giants and demons are exceedingly beautiful; they
are agleam with gold and precious stones; seats and beds are provided in
the mansions, and there are also recreation grounds, and forests and
mountains resembling clouds. Indeed, the Daityas and Danavas live pretty
much in the same manner as the gods, for "the gods and Danavas are
brothers, although ever hostile to one another". <span
id="fr_119"></span>[3](#fn_118.md) The Danava women are of gigantic
stature, and wear jewels as large as mountain boulders; when terrified
by the attacks of the gods, they "bewail like unto cranes in Autumn".
One of the Daitya tribes reside in the moving city named Hiranyapura,
which they constructed for their protection; sometimes it sinks below
the sea, or under the earth; at other times it soars across the heavens
like the sun. Indra, as we have seen, has a similar aerial city.

In the Underworld dwell also the Nagas, the demoniac Cobras; they are of
human form to the waist, the rest of their bodies being like those of
serpents. Their king is Shesha, who is also named Vasuki and Karkotáka;
he is sometimes represented with a thousand heads, and resembles Typhon,
who fought with Zeus. In the *Ramayana* he is Ravana, the Demon of
Ceylon. The

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

prototypes of Shesha and his hosts are the dragons Vritra, "the
encompasser"; Ahi, "the confiner"; and fierce Kushna, "the scorcher",
who spits out the sunset fires and burns up day.

When serpent worship became prevalent among the Aryans, the Nagas were
regarded as demigods. They were occasionally "the friends of man", and
to those they favoured they gave draughts of their nectar, which endowed
them with great strength. Their city was the Paradise of serpent
worshippers. The female Nagas were beautiful nymphs, who were sometimes
wooed by mortals.

As the Asuras are the enemies of the gods, the Rakshas or Rakshasas are
the enemies of man. <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_119.md) These demons
are "night prowlers"; they have greatest power after "the first forty
seconds of grey twilight preceding nightfall". They travel faster than
the wind, and go through the air; they have also power to change their
shape. Sometimes they appear in the guise of tigers, bears, or great
monkeys; and their hues vary from yellow to red, and blue to green. In
the *Ramayana* they are found associated with the Asuras of Ceylon; a
spy enters a demon dwelling and sees them in all their shapes, some
frightfully deformed, with small bodies and long arms; some as grotesque
dwarfs, others as horrible giants with long projecting teeth; some with
one eye, others with three eyes; some with one leg, two legs, or three,
or even four; and some with heads of serpents, horses, or elephants. In
the *Mahabharata* the Rakshasas are like gorillas; they have
arrow-shaped ears, big red eyes, and red hair and beards, and mouths
like caves; they feast on human beings and cattle. The heroic Bhima,
like Siegfried Dietrich of Bern, Beowulf, and Finn-mac-Cowl,

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

is a mighty slayer of these man-eating demons. They are impervious to
weapons, but Bhima wrestles with them and breaks their backs or tears
them asunder, after lively combats with trees and boulders. Female
Rakshasas sometimes fall in love with human beings, and transform
themselves into beautiful women. Bhima takes one for his bride, and she
carries him through the air to a Celestial retreat among the mountains.

The most loathsome Rakshasas are the goblin-like Pisachas, <span
id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) who are devourers of dead bodies in
cemeteries, and are exceedingly vile and malignant fiends. They are the
bringers of diseases and wasting fevers. In the *Atharvaveda* Agni is
invoked by the priests, who mutter charms over suffering and "possessed"
mortals, to take the Pisachas between his teeth and devour them. They
are "those who hound us in our chambers, while shouting goes on in the
night of the new moon . . . the flesh devourers, who plan to injure us,
and whom I overcome". The priest declares: "I plague the Pisachas as the
tiger the cattle owners. As dogs who have seen a lion, these do not find
a refuge. . . . From villages I enter Pisachas fly away. . . . May
Nirriti (a goddess of destruction) take hold of this one." <span
id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_121.md)

Kali, a demon who holds friendly converse with the gods in the "Story of
Nala", is attended by Dwápara, a flesh-eater like the Pisachas. The
Panis are aerial demons, who are hated by bluff, honest Indra, because
they are the inspirers of foolish actions, slander, and unbelief, and
the imps who encourage men to neglect homage to deities. The black
Dasyus are repulsive of aspect and jealous-hearted; they are the
stealers of the cloud cows who are held captive for Vritra in the cave

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

of the demon Vala. The Darbas, "the tearers", are a variety of Pisachas.
Reference is made in *Mahabharata* to "ugly Vartikas of dreadful sight,
having one wing, one eye, and one leg"; when they "vomit blood, facing
the sun", a dreadful happening is known to be at hand, because they are
fiends of evil omen.

Among the supernatural beings who are sometimes the enemies, but in most
cases the friends of mankind, are the Yakshas, the Gandharvas, and the
Apsaras (Apsarasas).

The Yakshas are occasionally referred to as the Punyajanas, "the good
people"; they may be of human stature, with big benevolent eyes, or
powerful giants who can fight as fiercely as Rakshasas. They are
guardians of hidden treasure, like the dwarfs and giants of Teutonic
legend, being associated with Kuvera, god of wealth, whose abode is
situated among the Himalayan mountains. In Kuvera's domain are found
"multitudes of spirits" who do not visit the world of men as a rule, but
remain near the treasure for purposes of defence; "some are of dwarfish
stature, some of fierce visage, some hunchbacked, some of blood-red
eyes, some of frightful yells; some are feeding upon fat and flesh, and
some are terrible to behold; and all are armed with various weapons, and
endued with the speed of the wind". <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_122.md)

The Gandharvas are grouped in tribes, and number over six thousand
individuals. They are all of the male sex. They haunt the air, the
forests, and the mountains, and, like the Rakshasas, have power to work
illusions in the grey twilight before nightfall. References are made in
the Epics to their combats with human beings. To warriors who overcome
them they impart instruction in religious matters; those whom they
conquer they carry

THE CELESTIAL FAIRIES (APSARAS)

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

away, like the Teutonic elves and dwarfs. The Gandharvas are renowned
musicians and bards and singers. When they play on their divine
instruments the fairy-like Apsaras, who are all females, dance merrily.
In the various Aryan heavens these elves and fairies delight and allure
with music and song and dance the gods, and the souls of those who have
attained to a state of bliss. The Apsara dancing girls are "voluptuous
and beautiful", and inspire love in Paradise as well as upon earth.
Their lovers include gods, Gandharvas, and mortals. Arjuna, the human
son of Indra, who was transported in a Celestial chariot to Swarga over
Suravithi, "the Milky Way", was enchanted by the music and songs and
dances of the Celestial elves and fairies. He followed bands of
Gandharvas who were "skilled in music sacred and profane", and he saw
the bewitching Apsaras, including the notorious Menaka, "with eyes like
lotus blooms, employed in enticing hearts"; they had "fair round hips
and slim waists", and "began to perform various evolutions, shaking
their deep bosoms and casting their glances around, and exhibiting other
attractive attitudes capable of stealing the hearts and resolutions and
minds of the spectators". <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_123.md)

In the *Rigveda* there is a water-nymph, named Apsaras; she is the
"spouse" of Gandharva, an atmospheric deity who prepares Soma for the
gods and reveals divine truths to mortals. They vanish, however, in
later times; the other Vedas deal with the spirit groups which figure so
prominently in the Epics. No doubt the groups are older than Gandharva,
the god, and Apsaras, the goddess, who may be simply the elf-king and
the fairy-queen. The "black" Dasyus are sometimes referred to by
modern-day writers as the dark aborigines who were displaced by the

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aryans; a tribal
significance is also given to the Rakshasas and the Gandharvas. But this
tendency to identify the creatures of the spirit world with human beings
may be carried too far. If "Dasyus" were really "dark folk", <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_124.md) it should be remembered that in Teutonic
mythology there are "black dwarfs", who live in underground dwellings,
and "white elves" associated with air and ocean; there are also black
and white fairies in the Scottish High-lands, so that black and white
spirits may simply belong to night and day spirit groups. It may be that
the Indian aborigines were referred to contemptuously as Dasyus by the
Aryans. The application of the names of repulsive imps to human enemies
is not an unfamiliar habit even in our own day; in China the European is
a "foreign devil", but Chinese "devils" existed long before Europeans
secured a footing in the Celestial Kingdom. Those who seek for a
rational explanation for the belief in the existence of mythical beings
should remember that primitive man required no models for the creatures
of his fancy. He symbolized everything--his ideals, his desires, his
hopes and his fears, the howling wind, the low whispering breeze, the
creaking tree, the torrent, the river, the lake, and the mountain; he
heard the hammer or the trumpet of a mighty god in the thunderstorm, he
believed that giants uprooted trees and cast boulders down mountain
slopes, that demons raised ocean billows in tempest, and that the strife
of the elements was a war between gods and giants; day and night, ever
in conflict, were symbolized, as were also summer and winter, and growth
and decay. If the fairies and elves of Europe are Lapps, or the small
men of an interglacial period

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

in the Pleistocene Age, and if the Dasyus and Gandharvas of India are
merely Dravidians and pre-Dravidians who resisted the Aryan invasion,
who, then, it may be asked, were the prototypes of the giants "big as
mountains", or the demons like "trees walking", the "tiger-headed"
Rakshasas, "ugly Vartikas" with "one wing, one eye, and one leg"? and
what animal suggested Vritra, or the fiery dragon that burned up
daylight, or Rahu, the swallower of sun and moon? If the redhaired and
red-bearded Rakshasas are to be given a racial significance, what of the
blue Rakshasas and the green? The idea that primitive man conceived of
giants because he occasionally unearthed the bones of prehistoric
monsters, is certainly not supported by Scottish evidence; Scotland
swarms with giants and hags of mountain, ocean, and river, although it
has not yielded any great skeletons or even a single artifact of the
Palæolithic Age. Giants and fairies are creations of fancy. Just as a
highly imaginative child symbolizes his fears and peoples darkness with
terrifying monsters, so, it may be inferred, did primitive man who
crouched in his cave, or spent sleepless nights in tempest-stricken
forests, conceive with childlike mind of demons thirsting for his blood
and giants of wind and fire intent on destroying the Universe.

In India, as elsewhere, the folk of the spirit world might woo or be
wooed by impressionable mortals. A Gandharva related to Arjuna, the
Pandava prince, by whom he was defeated in single combat, the "charming
story", as he called it, of King Samvarana and the fairy-like Tapati, a
daughter of the sun god, Surya. Tapati was of all nymphs the most
beautiful; she was "perfectly symmetrical" and "exquisitely attired";
she had "faultless features, and black, large eyes"; and, in contrast to
an Apsara, she "was chaste and exceedingly well conducted".

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For a time the sun
god considered that no husband could be found who was worthy of his
daughter; and therefore "knew no peace of mind, always thinking of the
person he should select". One day, however, King Samvarana worshipped
the sun, and made offerings of flowers and sweet perfumes, and Surya
resolved to bestow his daughter upon this ideal man.

It came to pass that Samvarana went a-hunting deer on the mountains. He
rode swiftly in pursuit of a nimble-footed stag, leaving his companions
behind, until his steed expired with exhaustion. Then he wandered about
alone. In a secluded wood he beheld a maiden of exquisite beauty; he
gazed at her steadfastly for a time, thinking she was a goddess or "the
embodiment of the rays emanating from the sun". Her body was as radiant
as fire and as spotless as the crescent moon; she stood motionless like
to a golden statue. The flowers and the creepers round about partook of
her beauty, and "seemed to be converted into gold". She was Tapati,
daughter of the sun.

The king's eyes were captivated, his heart was wounded by the arrows of
the love god Kama; he lost his peace of mind. At length he spoke and
said: "Who art thou, O fair one? O maiden of sweet smiles, why dost thou
linger in these lonely woods? I have never seen or heard of one so
beautiful as thee. . . . The love god tortures me."

That lotus-eyed maiden made no answer; she vanished from sight like to
lightning in the clouds.

The king hastened through the forest, lamenting for her: he searched in
vain; he stood motionless in grief; he fell down on the earth and
swooned.

Then, smiling sweetly, the maiden appeared again. In honeyed words she
spoke, saying: "Arise, thou tiger

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

among kings. It is not meet that thou shouldst lose thy reason in this
manner."

Samvarana opened his eyes and beheld Tapati. Weak with emotion he spoke
and said: "I am burning with love for thee, thou black-eyed beauty, O
accept me. My life is ebbing away. . . . I have been bitten by Kama, who
is even like a venomous snake. Have mercy on me. . . . O thou of
handsome and faultless features, O thou of face like unto the lotus or
the moon, O thou of voice sweet as that of singing Kinnaras, my life now
depends on thee. Without thee, O timid one, I am unable to live. It
behoveth thee not, O black-eyed maid, to cast me off; it behoveth thee
to relieve me from this affliction by giving me thy love. At the first
sight thou hast distracted my heart. My mind wandereth. Be merciful; I
am thy obedient slave, thy adorer. O accept me. . . . O thou of lotus
eyes, the flame of desire burneth within me. O extinguish that flame by
throwing on it the water of thy love. . . . " <span
id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_125.md)

Tapati replied: "I am not mistress of mine own self. I am a maiden ruled
by my father. If thou dost love me, demand me of him. My heart hath been
robbed by thee."

Then, revealing her identity, Tapati ascended to heaven, and once again
Samvarana fell upon the earth and swooned.

The ministers and followers of the king carne searching for him, and
found him "lying forsaken on the ground like a rainbow dropped from the
firmament". They sprinkled his face with cool and lotus-scented water.
When he revived, the monarch sent away all his followers except one
minister. For twelve days he worshipped the sun constantly on the
mountain top. Then a great

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rishi, whom he had
sent for, came to him, and the Rishi ascended to the sun. Ere long he
returned with Tapati, the sun god having declared that Samvarana would
be a worthy husband for his daughter.

For twelve years the king lived with his fairy bride in the mountain
forests, and a regent ruled over the kingdom.

But although the monarch enjoyed great bliss, living the life of a
Celestial, the people of the kingdom suffered greatly. For twelve years
no rain fell, "not even a drop of dew came from the skies, and no corn
was grown". The people were afflicted with famine; men grew reckless,
and deserted their wives and children; the capital became like to a city
of the dead.

Then a great Rishi brought Samvarana back to his capital with his
Celestial bride. And after that things became as they were before. Rain
fell in abundance and corn was grown. "Revived by that foremost of
monarchs of virtuous soul, the capital and the country became glad with
exceeding joy." <span id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_126.md) A son was born to
the king, and his name was Kuru.

There are many other uncatalogued Celestial beings like Tapati in Indian
fairyland. In the *Atharva-veda* there are numerous named and nameless
spirits of good and evil, and throughout the Epics references are made
to semi-divine beings who haunt streams, lakes, forests, and plains. A
Rigveda hymn is addressed to the forest nymph Aranyani. She echoes the
voices of man and beast and creates illusions:

She mimics kine that crop the grass,  
She rumbles like a cart at even, <span id="page_75">p. 75</span>  
She calls a cow, she hews down wood,  
The man who lingers says, "Who calleth?"

O Aranyani will not harm  
If one will not invade her dwelling,  
When, having eaten luscious fruit,  
At her sweet will she turns to slumber.

The singing birds are all singing spirits in India as in Europe. The
"language of birds" is the language of spirits. When Siegfried, after
eating of the dragon's heart, understood the "language of birds", he
heard them warning him regarding his enemies. Our seafarers whistle when
they invoke the spirit of the wind. Sir Walter Scott drew attention, in
his *Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border*, to the belief that the speech
of spirits was a kind of whistling. As we have seen, the wives of
Danavas had voices like Cranes; Homer's ghosts twittered like bats;
Egyptian ghosts were hooting owls. In India the croaking raven is still
a bird of evil omen, as it is also in the West. In the Scottish
Highlands the spirits of the dead sometimes appear as birds; so do
fairies. The Irish gods and the Celestial Rishis of India take the form
of swans, like the "swan maidens", when they visit mankind. In the
Assyrian legend of Ishtar the souls of the dead in Hades "are like birds
covered with feathers". Numerous instances could be quoted to illustrate
the widespread association of birds with the spirit world.
