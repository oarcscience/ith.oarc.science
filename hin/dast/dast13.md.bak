### CHAPTER IX.

### DEVOTION TO ISVARA.

#### Ninth Stanza of the Hymn.

To Him whose eightfold body is all this moving and unmoving universe,
appearing as earth, water, fire, air, âkâsa, the sun, the moon, and
soul; beyond whom, supreme and all-pervading, there exists none else for
those who investigate; to Him who is incarnate in the Teacher, to Him in
the Effulgent Form Facing the South, to Him (Siva) be this bow!

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

#### Maya ceases by Devotion.

1\. How can Mâyâ of this sort cease?—To him who thus asks, Devotion to
Isvara Is taught as the means to that end.

#### Devotion to Isvara in His visible forms.

2\. Of the thirty-six *tattvas* or principles which are the bodies of
Paramesvara, the eight forms are immediately perceived by all.

<span class="small">For the thirty-six principles enumerated in the
Saiva-Agamas, see chapter, II, 31–42.</span>

3\. Inasmuch as manas cannot readily ascend to incomprehensible matters,
the Guru teaches the contemplation of Sarvâtman, of the Universal Self
in the eight (visible) forms (mentioned in the ninth stanza).

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

<span class="small">The meaning of the ninth stanza may be explained as
follows:</span>

#### Unity of Macrocosm and Microcosm.

4\. In the Brahmânda,—in the body of the Virâj,—as well as in the body
of man, the aggregate of the thirty-six principles is present
everywhere.

<span class="small">The visible universe is made up of the eight forms
mentioned in the ninth stanza. The aggregate of the thirty-six
principles constitutes the body of Mahesvara. This, again, is two-fold,
the Adhidaiva and the Adhyatma, Cosmic and Personal. The. former
constitutes Brahmanda, made up of the fourteen worlds; and the latter
constitutes the *pinda*, the body of each individual. These two are one,
as cause and effect, the one being evolved out of the other. The devotee
should regard every principle in the individual or microcosmic body as
one with the corresponding principle in the Brahmanda or macrocosm. He
should also regard the Soul (Purusha) embodied in the former as one with
the</span>

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="small">Soul embodied in the latter. He should then contemplate
Mahes’vara as the Self (Atman) common to both. When the antah-karana is
steadied in the contemplation of the one Atman, the devotee, by the
Grace of the Supreme Lord, intuits Him in His essential being, and
attains the Supreme End. This whole process will be detailed
below.</span>

5\. The microcosmic (vyashti) manas pervades this microcosmic body.
Therefore, the individual body should be regarded as one with the
universe.

<span class="small">The Sruti (Bri. Up. 3–5-13) declares that manas,
prana and vach of the individual soul are infinite in space and time,
*i.e.*, are one with the Hiranyagarbha, otherwise called Lingatman. The
Hiranyagarbha functions chiefly in manas and has the Brahmanda for His
body, and He may, therefore, be regarded as pervading the individual
body which has been evolved out of the Brahmanda. Thus, as being equally
pervaded by Lingatman, the individual body may be looked on as one with
the Brahmanda.</span>

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

#### Devotion to Isvara in the Microcosm leads to unity with the Macrocosm.

6\. By contemplating Mahesvara (dwelling) in the microcosm (vyashti),
the devotee will become co-extensive with the macrocosm. This the Sruti
has declared ten times in the words "he unites with Atman."

<span class="small">Having first enumerated the [five](errata.htm#24.md)
kosas (sheaths) of the individual, the Taittiriya-Upanishad (2–8)
declares five times that the devotee attains unity with Brahman,
dwelling in the anandamaya kosa as the basis of all, in the words " He
unites with *annamaya* Atman; he unites with *pranamaya* Atman; he
unites with *manomaya* Atman; he unites with *vijnanamaya* Atman; he
unites with *anandamaya* Atman." Again, later on, the Upanishad speaks
of the five kosas in the macrocosm, and at the end (3–10) declares five
times, as shown above, that the devotee attains unity with
Brahman.</span>

#### Correspondences between Macrocosm and Microcosm.

<span class="small">Now the Vartikakara teaches how to see the macrocosm
in the microcosm:</span>

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

#### (1) Correspondences as to Earth.

7\. In the bosom of Brahmānda, seven worlds such as Bhûrloka are said to
exist. These dwell in the (seven) âdhâras (in the human body), form
Mûlâdhara up to Brahmarandhra:

<div align="center">

|        |           |                |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Bhûh   | dwells in |  Mûlâdhara.    |
| Bhuvah | „         | Svâdhishthâna. |
| Svah   | „         | Manipûraka.    |
| Mahah  | „         | Anâhata.       |
| Janah  | „         | Visuddha.      |
| Tapah  | „         | Âjnâ           |
| Satyam | „         | Sahasrâra.     |

</div>

8\. The back-bone is the Mahâmeru, and the bones near it are the
Kulaparvatas. The Ganges is Pingalâ Nâdî, while Idâ is said to be
Yamunâ.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

#### (2) Correspondences as to Waters.

9\. Sushumnâ is the Sarasvatî, and other nâdîs the other sacred rivers.
The seven *dhátus* are the seven *dvípas;* sweat, tears and the like are
the oceans.

#### (3) Correspondences as to Fire or Light.

10\. In the mûlâdhâra dwells the Kâlâgni, amidst bones is Bâdaba fire.
In sushumnâ lies the fire of lightning, and the earthly fire in the
region of the navel.

11\. In the heart lies the sun-fire; in the skull, the lunar orb; the
eye and other sense-organs are the other luminaries.

#### (4) Correspondences as to Air.

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

12\. As the worlds are supported by the *pravahana* and other vâyus, so
is the body supported by the ten vâyus such as prâna.

#### Different aspects of prana in the body.

13\. Starting from the mûlâdhâra, *prána* enters Idâ and Pingalâ in the
form of the sun, and goes out through the nostrils and disappears at a
distance of twelve inches.

14\. Coming as the moon from a distance of eight inches, it (the same
prâna) enters within through the two nâdîs. As apâna (it) throws out the
dung, the urine, the wind, and the semen.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

15\. As Agni (Fire) and Soma (Moon) in one, it enters into the cavity of
Sushumnâ; and rising up to Brahmarandhra, it grows into Udâna.

16\. Vyâna spreads every day throughout the body the essence of the food
eaten, while Samâna ever kindles the bodily fire.

17\. Nâga produces hiccup; Kûrma closes and opens the eye; Krikara
causes sneezing; Devadatta gives rise to yawning;

18\. Dhananjaya causes distension and leaves not even the corpse.

#### (5) Correspondences as to akasa.

Akâsa affords space within the body as well as without.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

<span class="small">There is the same akasa both in the microcosm and in
the Macrocosm.</span>

#### (6–8) Correspondences as to the Sun, the Moon and the Soul.

19\. The Sun and the Moon, the regulators of time, are the prâna and the
apâna of the embodied beings (*i.e.*, in the microcosm). The witness
(within) is the Purusha (without).

<span class="small">That is to say, the personal soul in the microcosm
corresponds to the cosmic soul, the Hiranyagarbha in the
macrocosm.</span>

#### Samanaska Yoga leads to the Amanaska.

20\. Practising the Samanaska-Yoga—this devotion with manas,—a Yogin,
perfect in the eight-stepped Yoga, rises to Amanaska (Isvara), to Him
who has no manas.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

#### The Eight Steps of Yoga.

\(1\) *Yama*.

21–22. Serenity of mind, contentment, silence, restraint of the senses,
kindness, generosity, faith, straightforwardness, tenderness, patience,
sincerity, harmlessness, continence, reflection, fortitude, these among
others are said to be Yamas, forms of self-control to be exercised by
the mind.

\(2\) *Niyama*.

23–24. Bathing, cleanliness, worshipping, japa (saying prayers), homa
(offering oblation), tarpana (propitiating), penance, charity,
endurance, bowing, pradakshina

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
(circum-ambulation), austerities, fasting these among others are said to
be Niyamas, forms of self-control to be effected through the body.

\(3\) *A’sana*.

24–26. Svastika, Gomukha, Padma, Hamsa—these are the Brâhmic postures
(Asanas). Nrisimha, Garuda, Kûrma, Nâga—these are the Vaishnava
postures. Vîra, Mayûra, Vajra, Siddha—these are the Raudra postures.
Yoni is the Sâkta posture. Paschima-tânaka is the Saiva posture.

<span class="small">*Brahmic*, etc.: appropriate to the contemplation of
Brahma, etc. For a description of the postures, see works on
Yoga.</span>

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

26–27. The posture for the Niràlambana-Yoga, is nirâlambana (lit.
propless, involving no specific position of hands, feet or other members
of the body); meditation should be on the Nirâlamba, and the Nirâlamba
is Sadâsiva, the Unconditioned, the Paramâtman.

\(4\) *Prànâyàma*.

27\. Restraint of breath comprises Rechaka (emptying), Pûraka (filling
in), and Kumbhaka (stopping).

\(5\) *Pratyàhàra*.

28\. The restraining of all the sense-organs from their objects is said
to be Pratyâhâra by those who know the process of pratyâhâra.

\(6\) *Dhàranà*.

29\. The fixing of the manas on some object of thought (âdhâra) is
termed Dhâranä, concentration.

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

<span class="small">The object of thought may be one of the six
*chakras* in the body, or the Divine Being in the form of Vishnu, etc.,
imaged in the heart.</span>

\(7\) *Dhyàna*.

Meditation of Brahmâ, Vishnu, Siva and the like is termed Dhyâna.

<span class="small">Dharana is the mere fixing of the manas and prana on
some object; while Dhyana consists in a continuous stream of thought
directed to Vishnu or some such object of thought.</span>

\(8\) *Samâdhi*.

30\. Steadiness of buddhi in Dhyàna is called Samâdhi; while the
Amanaska-Samâdhi is free from all thought (of differentiation).

#### Yoga necessary for steadiness of Manas and Prana.

31\. When chitta, the thinking principle, attains steadiness, prâna
becomes steady.

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

For steadiness of chitta, the devotee should practise Yoga with Dhyàna.

#### Lambika-Yoga.

32\. To contract apana, to restrain prana, and to fix the tongue on the
uvula,—this is a means to Yoga, to the restraining of chitta.

#### Signs of perfection in Yoga.

33\. When chitta becomes steady and prana is centred within, then, on
gaining control over the five elements, respectively, the following
marks appear:

<span class="small">Control over the five elements (bhutas) may be
gained by practising Dharana on their respective seats in the body. The
seat of earth extends from the foot to the knee; the seat of water from
the knee to the navel; the seat of fire, from the navel to the throat;
the seat of air, from the throat to the region between the eyebrows; and
the seat of akasa, from that region to Brahma-randhra.</span>

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

34\. Small quantity of dung, urine, and phlegm; health and lightness of
the body; fine smell, voice, and complexion,—these form the first group
of marks of Yoga, (marks of control over the earth-element).

35\. Not to be affected by the tips of thorns, not to become immersed in
water and mire, power to endure hunger, thirst and the like,—these form
the second group of marks of Yoga, (marks of control over the
water-element).

36\. Power to eat and drink much, to endure sun and fire, to see and
hear far,—these form the third group of marks

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

of Yoga, (marks of control over the fire-element).

37\. To leap like a frog, to jump over trees like a monkey, to walk in
the air,—these form the fourth group of marks of Yoga, (marks of control
over the air-element).

38\. Knowledge of all times, superhuman powers such as animâ, possession
of endless powers,—these form the fifth group of marks of Yoga, (marks
of control over the àkàsa-element).

39\. When pràna reaches sushumnâ, Nâda (sound) of eight sorts is heard
within: like the sound of a bell, a drum,

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

a conch, an ocean, a viná (a musical instrument), a flute, cymbals, etc.

#### Isvara's manifestation in Yoga.

40\. When prâna dwells in Brahma-nâdi (sushumnà), the Divine Being
appears in forms like those of fire, lightning, stars, the moon and the
sun.

#### Manifestation of Pranava in Yoga.

41\. In each breath the sun runs as many yojanas as there are breathings
of a man in a day.

42\. By breaths numbering twenty-one-thousand-and-six-hundred, Atman
daily repeats the mantra "*Soham*, He I am." for the prolongation of
life.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

43\. By omitting *s* and *h*, and by merging *a* in *o* preceding it,
the Pranava (Om) is formed.

44\. The wise say that *a*, *u*, *m*, the *bindu* and the *nada* are the
five aksharas (sounds) of the Pranava.

<span class="small">The *bindu* is the nasal vowel-sound, without which
the consonant *m* cannot be sounded. The *nada* is one with the sonant
prana. It starts from Muladhara and becomes manifested in the cavity of
the nadi through which the heated prana passes. The component parts of
Pranava being manifested by this nada, the Pranava is said to end with
nada. Thus *a*, *u*, *m*, *bindu*, and *nada* are the five aksharas or
sounds residing in Pranava, *i.e.*, in the body of man which is called
Pranava.</span>

45\. Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Isvara and Sadâsiva,—these dwell in the five

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

aksharas in conjunction with the thirty-six principles.

#### The Grace of God and Guru necessary.

46\. By the Guru's grace, the devotee attains the eight-stepped Yoga; by
Siva's Grace, he attains perfection in Yoga which is eternal.

<span class="small">Perfection in Yoga consists in the intuitive
recognition of the true nature of Atman.</span>

47\. To Him who is Being, Consciousness, and Bliss; who dwells in Bindu
and Nâda; who has no beginning, middle or end; to the Guru of the Gurus
be this bow!

This explains the meaning of pranava. Existence, Consciousness, and
Bliss, represented [respectively](errata.htm#25.md) by *a*, *u*, *m*,
constitute the Pranava and form the essential nature of Brahman. Bindu
and nada stand for name and form, the one standing

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

for the manifested name and form, and the other for the unmanifested
name and form; so that they show that He is the cause of the origin,
continuance and dissolution of the universe. They describe Him through
His acts, but not as He is in Himself.

48\. Thus ends the ninth chapter in brief in the work called
Mânasollâsa, which expounds the meaning. of the Hymn to the blessed
Dakshinâmurti.
