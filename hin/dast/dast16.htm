<p>other mighty sages for a great sacrifice. Then, desirous to know of Truth, they approached the long-lived M&acirc;rkandeya with sacrificial fuel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> in hand, and asked: Whereby dost thou live so long? and whereby dost thou enjoy such bliss?</p>  
<p>He said: It is by knowledge of the highest secret, of S&#8217;iva, the Reality.</p>  
<p>What is it which constitutes knowledge of the highest secret,&#8212;of Siva, the Reality? Who is the Deity there? What the mantras? What the devotion? What the means to that knowledge? What the necessary aids? What the offering? What the time? What the seat thereof?</p>

<p>He said: That constitutes knowledge of the Highest Secret,&#8212;of S&#8217;iva, the Reality&#8212;by which Siva, the Dakshin&acirc;mukha,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> becomes intuited. He is the Deity who, at the time of universal dissolution, absorbs all into Himself, and who shines and delights in the happiness of His own inherent bliss.</p>

<p><small>[Here the Upanishad mentions five mantras,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> containing respectively 24, 9, 18, 12, and 32 syllables, and recommends a contemplation of the Deity in one or another of His forms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> described as follows:]</small></p>  
<p>1. I adore the three-eyed, moon-crested Dakshin&acirc;m&ucirc;rti who is of pebble and silver colour, holding in the hands a rosary of pearls, a vessel of nectar, a book and the symbol of wisdom; having a serpent for his girdle, and putting on various ornaments.</p>  
<p>2. May the milk-white three-eyed Primal Being (Bhava) grant us purity of thought, He who, seated at the foot of a fig tree, surrounded by S&#8217;uka and other sages, holding in the hands the symbol of the blessed wisdom, with axe and deer,&#8212;one of the hands resting on the knees, the</p>

<p>

<p><a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></A></p>  
<p>loins girdled round by a mighty serpent, a digit of the moon enclosed in His clotted hair!</p>  
<p>3. May Dakshin&acirc;m&ucirc;rti, the Gracious Lord, ever protect us, His body white with ashes, wearing a digit of the moon, with the lotus-like hands shining with the symbol of wisdom, a rosary, a lute, and a book; handsome with the yogic bell, seated in the posture of an expositor, surrounded by hosts of mighty sages, with serpents on, and clad in hide!</p>  
<p>4. I adore Him who in His hands holds a via, a book and a rosary, with a cloudlike throat, who is rich in gifts, girdled by a mighty serpent, resorted to by S'uka and other sages; who has made the foot of a fig tree His abode.</p>  
<p>5. I contemplate, for the attainment of the highest end, the Supreme Guru, the spouse of Bhav&acirc;n&icirc;, the serene-faced Primal Being, He who is spoken of in all the Vedas (the first utterances), whose</p>  
<p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></A></p>  
<p>hands shine with the symbol (of wisdom), with a book and fire and a serpent, who, bedecked with garlands of pearls and a crown blazing forth brilliant with the digit of the moon, resides at the foot of a fig tree and removes the ignorance of all.</p>  
<p><small><i>Devotion</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> consists in firmly dwelling in the constant thought that "I am He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A>." Repetition of the mantra as inseparate from Him constitutes the means to that knowledge. To he concentrated in thought upon Him exclusively proves an effective aid to it. The dedicating of all bodily activity (to Him) forms the <i>offering</i>. The three states of consciousness (<i>dh&acirc;mans</i> or <i>avasthas</i>, such as j&agrave;grat, svapna, and sushupti) are the proper time for it. The proper <i>place</i> is the twelve-pointed seat (<i>i.e.</i>, the. sahasr&acirc;ra or thousand-spoked wheel in the cavity of the head).</small></p>

<p>Then again they asked Him as follows, full of faith: How comes His manifestation? What is His form? And who is His worshipper?</p>  
<p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></A></p>  
<p>He said: In the mighty lamp of <i>wisdom</i>, overflowing with the oil of <i>vairagya</i> (indifference to worldly objects) and furnished with the wick of <i>Bhakti</i> (Faith) one should kindle the light of knowledge and see. Then the darkness of delusion being dispelled, (S&#8217;iva) Himself becomes manifested. With a view to dispel the utter darkness, the devotee should produce fire, making <i>vairagya</i> the lower <i>arani</i> (stick) and knowledge the upper one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A>; and then S&#8217;iva will exhibit to his view the hidden Reality. Dwelling in the devotee as his own very Self with His inherent bliss, He revives <i>viveka</i> or discriminative wisdom hitherto overpowered with delusion and oppressed by duality for want of proper enquiry into truth. Thus (in the language of the Purina) S&#8217;iva, showing Himself in all His bliss, restores to life the son of Mrikandu, hitherto</p>

<p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></A></p>  
<p>oppressed with the fear of Yama, the latter dragging him with the bands of rope tied around his body.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The word 'Dakshin&acirc;' means Buddhi. Because Buddhi is the eye by which S&#8217;iva can be <i>directly</i> seen, He is called <i>Dakshinabhimtikha</i> by the Brahma-v&acirc;dins.</p>  
<p>At the beginning of creation, Brahm&acirc; the Lord, having worshipped S&#8217;iva, attained power to create and was delighted at heart. The devotee in this path, steady in his effort; attains all objects of desire and becomes quite happy.</p>  
<p>Whoever studies this highly Secret Doctrine of Siva, the Reality, He is delivered from all sins. He who knows thus attains liberation.</p>

Those who are not equal to the contemplation of the Divine Being in the latter aspect are recommended to contemplate Him in the former.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_8"></A><A HREF="dast16.htm#fr_8">217:&#8224;</A> These mantras are not given in the translation, because, to be effective at all, they should be learned from a duly initiated Guru. In the longer mantras, the Deity is invoked to grant spiritual wisdom to the devotee.</P>

Here, according to the Upanishad, Markandeya takes the place of <i>Viveka</i> or wisdom; Yama, of <i>moha</i> or delusion; ropes, of the absence of enquiry; and fear, of the duality.</P><p>&nbsp;</p>  </div>  </BODY>
