### II.

## SURESVARACHARYA'S

# PRANAVA-VARTIKA

#### TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH.

### PRANAVA-VARTIKA.

#### Purpose of the Tract.

1\. The syllable 'Om' is the essence of all the Vedas, illuminating the
Truth. How thereby to secure balance of mind will be shown to those who
wish for liberation.

#### The Avyakrita.

2\. There was the One Supreme Brahman, the ever Unbound and Immutable.
By association with Its own Maya, It became the Seed, the *Avyâkrita* or
Undifferentiated Cause of matter.

#### The Sutra or Hiranyagarbha.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

3\. Thence was Akâsa born, the *Sabda-tanmâtra*, sound in essence;
thence came Vâyu, the *Sparsa-tanmâtra*, touch in essence; thence Tejas,
*Rûpa-tanmâtra*, colour in essence; thence Waters, *Rasa-tanmâtra*,
sapidity in essence; thence Earth, *Gandha-tanmâtra*, odour in essence.
Akâsa has the sole quality of sound; Vâyu has the qualities of sound and
touch; Tejas has three qualities,—sound, touch, and colour; Waters have
four qualities,—sound, touch, colour and sapidity; Earth has five
qualities,—sound, touch, colour, sapidity and smell. From them was
produced the great *Sùtra* or *Linga*, ensouling all.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

#### The Viraj.

4\. Thence came the five gross elements, and out of these came the Virâj
into being. When bhûtas or elements are quintupled, they are said by the
wise to become gross elements.—Let each of the five elements, such as
earth, be divided into two halves; and let one half of each be again
divided into four parts, and let one of these parts

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

of one element be combined with the other elements, one part with each.
Thus in the element of âkâsa there are five parts, four of which are
parts of Vâyu and the rest. <span id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3.md) The same
principle should be applied to Vâyu, etc. Those who know truth declare
that such is the quintupling of the elements. The elements thus
quintupled, together with their products, go to form the Virâj. This is
the sthûla or gross body of Atman who has (really) no body whatever.

#### Three aspects of the manifested Brahman.

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span> <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

5\. Threefold, as the *Adhidaiva* (the region of Cosmic Intelligences),
as the *Adhyâtma* (the individual man), as the *Adhibhûta* (the external
visible world), does the One Brahman appear in
[different](errata.htm#26.md) forms, as shown below, owing to illusion; not
in reality:—

#### Visva and His unity with the Viraj

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

6\. The cognising by external and internal organs of sensation,—helped
by the co-operation of the several Intelligences (Devatâs),—of their
respective objects is said to be the jâgrat state. The Atman identifying
Himself with this jâgrat state, and with the physical body, which is the
seat of the sense organs, is called Vis’va. One should regard Vis’va in
the form of the Virâj, for the cessation of difference.

#### Taijasa and His unity with the Hiranyagarbha

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

7\. The *Sûkshina-Sarîra* or subtle body of the Pratyagâtman, which is
but illusory, comprises the following:—

\(1\) The five organs of sensation, namely, the organs of hearing,
touch, sight, smell and taste.

\(2\) The five organs of activity, namely, the organ of speech, hands,
feet, the anus and the organ of generation.

\(3\) The fourfold internal organ as made up of *Manas*, composed of
formative thoughts: *Buddhi*, which is of the nature

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

of determination; *Ahankara*, the Egoism making up the personality; and
*Chitta*, the faculty of reflection.

\(4\) The five functions of prâna or vital force; namely, prâna, apâna,
vyâna, udâna, and samâna.

\(5\) The *puryashtaka* or the eight regions, comprising the five subtle
elements such as âkâsa (ether), vâyu (air), fire, water, earth; as well
as avidyâ, kâma, and karma. They say that this *puryashtaka* is called
*Linga-sarira*.

The consciousness which, during the quiescence of the sense-organs,
arises in the form of the percipient and objects of perception
manifested in virtue of the samskâras or latent impressions of the
jâgrata state, is called *svapna*. The entity who indentifies himself
with these, *i.e.*, with the subtle body and the svapna state, is termed
*Taijasa*. The wise man should think of the Taijasa as one with the
Hiranyagarbha.

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

#### Prajna and His unity with I’s’vara

8\. The ignorance or nescience of Âtman blended with a semblance of
consciousness, is the cause of the two bodies (*Sthûla*, and *Sûkshma*);
and it is called *Avyakta* the Unmanifested, and *Avyäkrita*, the
Undifferentiated. It is neither existent, nor non-existent, nor both
existent and non-existent. It is neither distinct (from Brahman) nor
non-distinct, nor both (distinct and non-distinct). It is neither made
of parts, nor partless, nor both

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (made of parts and
partless). It is removed by the knowledge of the unity of Brahman and
Atman, inasmuch as it is false. The cessation of all cognitions, the
state of Buddhi remaining in the form of its cause as the fig-tree
remains in the fig-seed, is called *sushupti*. The entity who identifies
himself with these two (with Avyakta and Sushupti) is called Prâjna. One
should regard Prâjna-Atman as one with (I’s’vara or Akshara) the Cause
of the universe.

#### The One Reality

9\. The one Reality, which is consciousness in essence, appears by
illusion as different, in the form of Vis’va, Taijasa, and Prâjna; as
also in the form of Virâj, Sûtra and Akshara. Since the three entities,

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

such as Vis’va, Taijasa and Prâjna are one with the three entities such
as Virâj, Sûtra and Akshara, one should regard them all as one and the
same, so that the absence of all else may become manifest.

#### Contemplation of A’tman by Pranava.

10\. The whole universe, composed of Prâjna and so on, is one with the
syllable 'Om'; for, the universe is made up of designations and the
designated, which are never in fact [perceived](errata.htm#27.md)
separately. Visva is one with the syllable '*a*'; the syllable '*u*' is
said to be one with Taijasa, and the syllable '*m*' is one with Prâjna.
In this order one should regard them.

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

II\. Prior to the time of *Samâdhi*, one should thus contemplate with
much effort and then dissolve the whole universe in the Conscious Self,
step by step, dissolving the gross in the subtler one. The devotee
should dissolve the syllable '*a*,' the Visva aspect of the Self, in the
syllable '*u*'; and the syllable '*u*,' the subtle Taijasa, in the
syllable '*m*'; the syllable '*m*,' the Prâjna, in the Chidâtman, the
Conscious Self. "I am the Conscious Self, the Eternal, Pure, Wise,
Liberated, Existent, Secondless; I am the 'Om,' Vâsudeva, the Supreme

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bliss in its
entirety;" having thus thought, he should dissolve even this
discriminative thought (Chitta) in the Witness thereof. When dissolved
in the conscious A’tman, that thought should no longer be disturbed He
should remain as the all-full consciousness, like the full unmoving
ocean.

I2. Thus having attained balance in mind, endued with faith and
devotion, having subdued the sense-organs, having overpowered anger, the
Yogin should see the secondless A’tman. Because at the beginning, at the
middle and at the end, all this is pain, therefore he should always
firmly dwell in the Reality abandoning all.

#### Ji’vanmukti.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

13\. For him who sees the all-pervading tranquil, secondless, blissful
A’tman, there remains nothing to be attained or known. Having achieved
all aspirations, he becomes wise; he always remains a

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ji’vanmukta. Fixed
in A’tman with all his being, he never indeed sees the universe. No
doubt he becomes aware of the dual universe occasionally when he is
awake to the world around; but then he sees it not as something
different from the Conscious A’tman, inasmuch as
[Consciousness](errata.htm#28.md) runs through all. On the other hand, he
sees this universe as false, like the confusion of the four quarters, or
like the appearance of many moons. Then, owing to the accumulated
prârabdha-karma,—karma which has already begun its effects,—he is aware
of a semblance of the body. The S’ruti says that he has to wait only
till death; and even the continuance of the prârabdha in the case of the
liberated one is a mere illusion. This person, having known the Reality,
is always free from bonds and never otherwise. On the exhaustion of the
fruits of the prârabdha, he attains at once to the Vishnu's state, which
is beyond the darkness of avidyâ, free from all false

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

appearances,—the pure stainless Consciousness which is beyond the reach
of thought and speech, free from all designations and designated
objects, and devoid of anything which has either to be acquired or cast
aside; which is Bliss and Wisdom in one solid mass.

#### Conclusion.

14\. Therefore this tract should be learned by all devotees, endued with
the attributes of pridelessness, etc., (*vide* Bhagavadgi’ta, XII.
13–20), with devotion

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

to the Guru and with His grace. The wise yogin should try and reflect
upon this vidyâ at all times of sandhyâ, not engrossed in the objects of
pleasure, of this or the next world. He should always contemplate his
own A’tman who is free from all attachment and hatred.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_3"></span>[194:\*](dast15.htm#fr_3.md) The quintupled akasa,
then, contains one half of pure akasa, the other half being composed of
the other elements, each of which forms one eighth of the whole.
