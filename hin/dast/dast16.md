Om! In the Brahmâvarta, at the foot of a mighty *bhândira* fig tree,
there assembled Sanaka and

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

other mighty sages for a great sacrifice. Then, desirous to know of
Truth, they approached the long-lived Mârkandeya with sacrificial
fuel <span id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_6.md) in hand, and asked: Whereby dost
thou live so long? and whereby dost thou enjoy such bliss?

He said: It is by knowledge of the highest secret, of S’iva, the
Reality.

What is it which constitutes knowledge of the highest secret,—of Siva,
the Reality? Who is the Deity there? What the mantras? What the
devotion? What the means to that knowledge? What the necessary aids?
What the offering? What the time? What the seat thereof?

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

He said: That constitutes knowledge of the Highest Secret,—of S’iva, the
Reality—by which Siva, the Dakshinâmukha, <span
id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md) becomes intuited. He is the Deity who, at
the time of universal dissolution, absorbs all into Himself, and who
shines and delights in the happiness of His own inherent bliss.

<span class="small">\[Here the Upanishad mentions five mantras, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[†](#fn_8.md) containing respectively 24, 9, 18, 12, and
32 syllables, and recommends a contemplation of the Deity in one or
another of His forms <span id="fr_9"></span>[‡](#fn_9.md) described as
follows:\]</span>

1\. I adore the three-eyed, moon-crested Dakshinâmûrti who is of pebble
and silver colour, holding in the hands a rosary of pearls, a vessel of
nectar, a book and the symbol of wisdom; having a serpent for his
girdle, and putting on various ornaments.

2\. May the milk-white three-eyed Primal Being (Bhava) grant us purity
of thought, He who, seated at the foot of a fig tree, surrounded by
S’uka and other sages, holding in the hands the symbol of the blessed
wisdom, with axe and deer,—one of the hands resting on the knees, the

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

loins girdled round by a mighty serpent, a digit of the moon enclosed in
His clotted hair!

3\. May Dakshinâmûrti, the Gracious Lord, ever protect us, His body
white with ashes, wearing a digit of the moon, with the lotus-like hands
shining with the symbol of wisdom, a rosary, a lute, and a book;
handsome with the yogic bell, seated in the posture of an expositor,
surrounded by hosts of mighty sages, with serpents on, and clad in hide!

4\. I adore Him who in His hands holds a via, a book and a rosary, with
a cloudlike throat, who is rich in gifts, girdled by a mighty serpent,
resorted to by S'uka and other sages; who has made the foot of a fig
tree His abode.

5\. I contemplate, for the attainment of the highest end, the Supreme
Guru, the spouse of Bhavânî, the serene-faced Primal Being, He who is
spoken of in all the Vedas (the first utterances), whose

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

hands shine with the symbol (of wisdom), with a book and fire and a
serpent, who, bedecked with garlands of pearls and a crown blazing forth
brilliant with the digit of the moon, resides at the foot of a fig tree
and removes the ignorance of all.

<span class="small">*Devotion* <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md)
consists in firmly dwelling in the constant thought that "I am He <span
id="fr_11"></span>[†](#fn_11.md)." Repetition of the mantra as inseparate
from Him constitutes the means to that knowledge. To he concentrated in
thought upon Him exclusively proves an effective aid to it. The
dedicating of all bodily activity (to Him) forms the *offering*. The
three states of consciousness (*dhâmans* or *avasthas*, such as jàgrat,
svapna, and sushupti) are the proper time for it. The proper *place* is
the twelve-pointed seat (*i.e.*, the. sahasrâra or thousand-spoked wheel
in the cavity of the head).</span>

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

Then again they asked Him as follows, full of faith: How comes His
manifestation? What is His form? And who is His worshipper?

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

He said: In the mighty lamp of *wisdom*, overflowing with the oil of
*vairagya* (indifference to worldly objects) and furnished with the wick
of *Bhakti* (Faith) one should kindle the light of knowledge and see.
Then the darkness of delusion being dispelled, (S’iva) Himself becomes
manifested. With a view to dispel the utter darkness, the devotee should
produce fire, making *vairagya* the lower *arani* (stick) and knowledge
the upper one <span id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md); and then S’iva will
exhibit to his view the hidden Reality. Dwelling in the devotee as his
own very Self with His inherent bliss, He revives *viveka* or
discriminative wisdom hitherto overpowered with delusion and oppressed
by duality for want of proper enquiry into truth. Thus (in the language
of the Purina) S’iva, showing Himself in all His bliss, restores to life
the son of Mrikandu, hitherto

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

oppressed with the fear of Yama, the latter dragging him with the bands
of rope tied around his body. <span id="fr_13"></span>[†](#fn_13.md)

The word 'Dakshinâ' means Buddhi. Because Buddhi is the eye by which
S’iva can be *directly* seen, He is called *Dakshinabhimtikha* by the
Brahma-vâdins.

At the beginning of creation, Brahmâ the Lord, having worshipped S’iva,
attained power to create and was delighted at heart. The devotee in this
path, steady in his effort; attains all objects of desire and becomes
quite happy.

Whoever studies this highly Secret Doctrine of Siva, the Reality, He is
delivered from all sins. He who knows thus attains liberation.

SUCH IS THE UPANISHAD.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[211:\*](dast16.htm#fr_4.md) This Upanishad is said
to belong to the Black Yajur-Veda.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[211:†](dast16.htm#fr_5.md) *i.e.*, master and
pupil.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[212:\*](dast16.htm#fr_6.md) An offering with which
a disciple approaches a teacher of spiritual wisdom.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[213:\*](dast16.htm#fr_7.md) The word
'Dakshinamukha' is interpreted in two ways: *first* as referring to that
Incarnation of Siva in which He is represented as a Guru teaching
spiritual wisdom at the foot of a fig tree with His face turned to the
South; *secondly* as referring to the Unconditioned Formless Divine
Being who can be intuited only by the *dakshina* or buddhi becoming
perfectly pure and serene. Those who are not equal to the contemplation
of the Divine Being in the latter aspect are recommended to contemplate
Him in the former.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[217:†](dast16.htm#fr_8.md) These mantras are not
given in the translation, because, to be effective at all, they should
be learned from a duly initiated Guru. In the longer mantras, the Deity
is invoked to grant spiritual wisdom to the devotee.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[217:‡](dast16.htm#fr_9.md) For the contemplation to
prove effective, the devotee should contemplate the Deity in the form
described in the scriptures.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[219:\*](dast16.htm#fr_10.md) This and what follows
form answers to so me of the questions put by the sages to the Teacher.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[219:†](dast16.htm#fr_11.md) *i.e.*. "I am
identical with S’iva."

<span id="fn_12"></span>[221:\*](dast16.htm#fr_12.md) The figure refers to
the process of producing fire by attrition for sacrificial purposes.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[222:†](dast16.htm#fr_13.md) This is one of the
many instances where a minor Upanishad affords an esoteric
interpretation of a Puranic allegory, The Purana says that the sage
Markandeya was first destined to live a very short life; but that, by
devotion to God—to Siva according to some puranas, to *Vishnu* according
to others—he overcame Yama, god of death, who came on the appointed day
to take away his life and began to drag him by means of his bands of
rope. Here, according to the Upanishad, Markandeya takes the place of
*Viveka* or wisdom; Yama, of *moha* or delusion; ropes, of the absence
of enquiry; and fear, of the duality.
