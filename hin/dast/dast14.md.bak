### CHAPTER X.

### PERFECTION.

#### Tenth Stanza of the Hymn.

Because the universality of Atman has thus been explained in this hymn,
therefore by hearing it, by reflecting and meditating upon its teaching,
and by reciting it, that Divine State which is endued with the mighty
grandeur of being the Universal Self shall, of itself, come into being,
as also that unimpeded Divine Power presenting itself in forms eight.

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

#### The Highest end.

1\. To attain to the (natural) state of the Universal Ego, by giving up
the casual state of the limited Ego, is declared (in the tenth stanza)
to be the end of this hymn.

The Ego is, in Himself, one and universal. He becomes many and detached
only by attachment to the bodies which are many and separate from one
another. The aim of the hymn is to produce, in man, a conviction of this
truth and thereby to reclaim the Ego from his present separate existence
and life.

The meaning of the tenth stanza may be explained as follows:

2\. Sons, grandsons, houses, lands, money, grain, all in plenty—these
lower ends, too, accrue in svarga, in pâtàla and on the earth.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

<span class="small">Though the devotee will attain all things of desire
by this hymn, yet the wise man should not resort to it for attaining
such lower ends as these. He should ever aim at the highest object,
nothing short of attaining to the state of Paramesvara Himself. That
being achieved, everything else will have been attained as a matter of
course.</span>

3\. As cold is warded off from him who is engaged in cooking, so by this
hymn all gain will accrue to him incidentally.

4\. Lordliness is in the very nature of Isvara, the Divine Being. It
has, indeed, no separate existence from Him. Though man may be running,
yet his shadow accompanies him.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

5\. Infinite Power is in the nature of Isvara, the Divine Being, and
*animâ* and the like are only a few drops that trickle down from it.
When the devotee has himself become Isvara, they come to him of
themselves.

6\. Atman is none other than Sadâsiva, and it is by drops of Atman's
power that Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva shine so powerful.

7\. By him who carries a flower, its odour is enjoyed without his
seeking for By him who has realised. himself as I. the Universal Ego,
the limited powers (of Brahma, etc.) are enjoyed.

#### The Eight Siddhis.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

8\. Animâ (smallness), Mahimâ (vastness), Garimâ (heaviness), Laghimâ
(lightness), Prâpti (range of vision), Prâkâmya (freedom of will),
Isitva (power to command), Vasitva (power to control)—these are the
*eight siddhis* (powers).

9\. The power called *animà* (smallness) consists in the all-pervading
Paramatman entering into extremely small creatures as their Atman.

10\. The power called *mahimà* (vastness) consists in the group of the
thirty-six principles, from Brahmanda to Siva, pervading every-where
outside.

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

11\. The wise hold that *laghimà* (lightness) consists in (the
Yogin)—whose body is equal to Mahameru—being as light as cotton when
being lifted up.

12\. The wise hold that *garimà* (heaviness) consists in (the
Yogin)—whose body is as small as an atom—being as heavy as Meru when
being lifted up.

13\. The power called *pràjpti* (range of vision) consists in a person
who lives in Pâtâla seeing the Brahmaloka; and it is very hard to attain
for those who are not Yogins.

14\. The attaining, by one's own mere will, of power to journey through
the

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

sky and of other such powers is called *prâkàmya* (freedom of will).

15\. Some declare that there is a power called *pvàkàs’ya* (luminosity),
in virtue of which all things shine in the light of the Yogin's own
body.

16\. The power to cause, by mere will, a creation of one's own, its
continuance, and dissolution, and to command the sun and the like is
called *Isitva* (supremacy).

17\. *Vasitva* (the power of controlling) consists in having all the
worlds as well as the lords of those worlds under one's

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

own control; and it is easy for Siva-Yogins to acquire that power.

#### Glory of the Divine Contemplation

18\. Devas are under the control of that Brâhmana who contemplates as
above: what need is there to say that princes, tigers, snakes, women,
men, and the like (are subject to his control)?

19\. To those in whose minds the conviction as to their being one with
the Universal Ego holds an unintermittent sway, to those who are perfect
in samâdhi, what is there which cannot be attained?

20, The wise man should recite this hymn and contemplate on the idea
that

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

he is the Self in all, abandoning all yearning for the lesser fruits
arising from svarga and so on.

21\. No wise man, indeed, ever looks upon the kingdom of svarga as a
great empire. That alone is his empire, namely, the identity of his Self
with the Supreme Being.

22\. All siddhis (powers) come to him who ever contemplates the Self in
all. Wherefore, with the mind controlled, one should hold his empire in
the Atman.

#### Love of God and Guru essential for wisdom.

23\. "Who so hath highest love for God, and for the Guru as for God, to
that

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mahâtman the
truths here taught shine in full."

24\. He Who, by His power of light, affords light to all lights, Who
lights the whole universe, may that Light shine full in His light!

25\. Thus ends the tenth chapter in brief in the work called
Mânasollâsa, which expounds the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed
Dakshinâmûrti.

 

*Om Tat Sat*.
