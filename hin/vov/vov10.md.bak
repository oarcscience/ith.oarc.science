800

Whatever creed we [examine](errata.htm#142.md) all are the creed of woman;
besides, [assuredly](errata.htm#143.md) my creed is the creed of woman! For
love is the aim of every enquiry. He who comprehendeth my creed he is
the excellent.

801

When the husband; son--both (join) at once look at the wife's breasts
with constant gaze; the husband looks with desire for the flesh upon it,
the son for milk within it.

802

Being himself the son of another daughter the base wretch drives away
his mother. Such blackguards are not produced even by boars.

803

By building chatrams (inns) at every step and by possession and wealth
they increase their splendour; [where ever](errata.htm#144.md) they wander
their shadow [follows](errata.htm#145.md) them; i.e., God will reward them.

804

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

You take a binding rope, bind and secure it. What theft has Lingadu
stolen that he should be thus treated? Why is it that ye cannot be thus
treated? Why is it that ye cannot see and worship the invisible atma
linga?

805

To eat the *caraca* fruit (autaphrodisiac) and to bind his langoti
tight, and to desert all women shew a vile nature. If thou bind it
firmly (lit. pleasurably) to a twig, will an elephant remain fixed.

806

Musing on a sweet lip, we forget all wisdom; how shall the man of
devotion know Thee. O God! Through a sight of the yoni shall we forget
(Parama yogam) meditation on the supreme.

807

They cannot understand that there is but one God in the Siva, the Vishnu
and all other creeds! Though these differ, can any diversity exist in
truth (tatwa)?

808

Illusion (or death) is not an inconstant woman with glancing eyes,
wearing beads and earrings and mounting on her husband's shoulder, she
delays not to slay those who yield to her.

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

809

Nourishing matted locks, to cry shame on the world, to distort all the
limbs and all yogeeism (devoteeism)--This is to seize the woman of
beatitude and kiss her.

810

Who is unable to instruct the minds of those brutes clothed in human
bodies who, while the mighty all exists within themselves seek him not
within themselves but roam the earth to find him.

811

All those who pride on themselves on having bathed in the Ganges are
defeated and consider their acts as mere vexation; surely the holy water
of Vema's wisdom is nobler than the stream of Ganges and Gaya.

812

Mounting the steed of thy mind not knowing how to govern it perplexing
it, why should the rider set out? Is Banares a dear friend of thine?
Govern thy mind and thou shalt be independent of pilgrimage.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

813

You put Siva, source of the Ganges, in the palm of your hand; and yet
roam to the holy streams. This is like possessing butter and yet
searching for melted butter.

814

Why go to Mecca? Why return thence? Is not the only lord here with us?
Allah Mohammad universally exists in his fullness. (spreads undivided,
animates unspurt)

815

The fool binds a linga to his throat, and this also being insufficient
he climbs the mountain to visit the linga shine there at. Such a one can
see beatitude?

816

They who knowing not the God who dwelleth in their body, wander and
become tenants of the holy springs. These are like the ass that beareth
about the sandal tree.

817

If thou perform bathing but give no charity thou gainest but the
[advantage](errata.htm#146.md) of the plunge, void of instruction. Is not a
fowl well versed in plunging in water?

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

[818](errata.htm#147.md)

O! ye! hypocrites, who ignorant of the revolution of time, continually
[perform](errata.htm#148) the daily rites and (meditation.md) *japa*, what
may be the path by which perfection is attainable through these rites
and postures.

819

Some of these fools wander this starry land to worship. They go to
Ramanatha (Rameswaram) and then suffer scorn. They go to Concan on
pilgrimage but in truth merely to hear news that they had never heard.

820

By going a pilgrimage to Banares, and bathing on the Ganges ye indeed
suffer hardship but shall never attain heaven. No more than a buffalo
calf can resemble a cow by merely following about it.

821

If a fellow has gone to Banares what shall we say he has done? What if
there had been something to cause his death and he had died on the road,
his mind truly might still go to Kasi, but never can attain the better
world.

822

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

If he who go to Kasi with great enthusiasm when by the wisdom of God
they change their bodies, in transmigration he gives half his merits to
his wife, and has only half to himself.

823

They who go to Kasi, get trouble and nothing else; why should ye roam
merely to get an itching in your feet. Will not women also for hire get
water and bear it about for hire?

824

A dog that has gone to Tirupati does not become a lion. A pig that goes
to Kasi is no elephant. A whore that goes to the Sri Shylam is no modest
woman.

825

Ceasing from food and sleep, a fool utterly void of understanding, for
the sake of beatitude, roams the earth; he rambles like a mad dog.

826

He who calls himself a yogee, and gets together some of the components
of yogeeism, and kills those who are in the world--that yogi who roams
and robs men is no yogi but a (Ogu) vile wretch.

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

827

He who holds himself (a Paramahamsa) a perfect
[ascetic](errata.htm#149.md), by rarely wearing a dress and longs for the
wealth of others 's no ascetic but (Parahimsa) death itself.

828

Postures and the like, bathings in the worship, pilgrimage to Kasi or a
system of good works unless thou stay thy mind however many such paths
thou walk, know that they shall avail you nothing.

[829](errata.htm#150.md)

They will [journey](errata.htm#151.md) on pilgrimages to Kasi and the
bridge of Rameswaram. They can hereby behold piles of stones but not
heaven, not even one of them.

830

If thou give food to Bramins, they say it will be profitable to thee; if
you were to give it to dogs where would be the harm (inferiority)? They
say that one soul resides (both here and there) in
[each](errata.htm#152.md).

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

831

The fool left his relations, bound himself with an iron langoti and
[quitting](errata.htm#153.md) food and drink, and exceeded. If we give up
the fluids of the body, can we attain perfection. How shall we have
strength to worship?

832

Plunging, plunging and plunging in holy streams, squatting and
[squatting](errata.htm#154.md) in meditation, talking and talking, charms
becoming leaner and leaner, roaming, roaming, roaming and roaming from
sanctuary to sanctuary--ye turn giddy and are ruined.

832

The impurities in the belly being the vilest of all, is the juice of
food worse than that? Those therefore who fast, are fools unable to form
comparisons.

834

He ignorant of the being that dwelleth in the body, wanders in other
pilgrimages is a fool. Does not a jackass thus roam bearing a pack
saddle.

835

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

That world hater (or recluse) who is attached only to using the words of
stubbornness, no-where shall he [attain](errata.htm#155.md) the power of
quelling death (yama). The recluse of the iron age is vile as the
drinker of palm wine.

836

With their matted locks a fathom long, and their smearings of ashes,
they forsooth are able to dispute the day with cupid himself and after
all their very garments become the property (petticoats) of whores.

837

By a bald, head, and white streaks of ashes and postures, and airy diet,
by all this a man is not a yogi unless his inner man be right.

838

If we look at the fine dresses (sects) they are marvellously foolish.
Devotion does not hereby dwell in the soul. They merely form la
startling appearance. They have neither the title nor the nature
(viracti) of saints.

839

If you see among harmless cattle, one handsome ox with horns, it is
indeed superior. But is wisdom attained by the mere shaven baldness of
the sanyasi? (who only resemble helpless [widows](errata.htm#156.md) in
this fancy)

840

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

The long windedness (lit. breath) of a fowl, the steadfast gaze of a
frog--such follies are written by fate in the forehead of the devotee.
This must surely befall him through his sins in a former birth.

841

If he rub ashes to his body and wear long locks, though he be a king he
shall fail of heaven; however stiff a screen be, is it yet a door?

842

While all the precepts declare Siva to be the divinity, they seek and
worship other deities; surely Bramins are in the path of destruction.

[843](errata.htm#157.md)

Hanging down their heads, void of the least patience opening and
shutting his eyes and dumb--this is no wisdom but merely the residue of
thy sins.

[844](errata.htm#158.md)

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

Woe to the world that is full of the destruction of souls. But first the
woe to the Brahma! View all the Gods! Woe to them all.

845

They call Brahma the author of the writing of fate in our foreheads.
Perhaps Brahma, who dwelleth in the lotus (wrote) destined that his own
head should cleave to the hand of (Bhava) Siva! (Siva smote Brahma on
one head which was separated and cleave to his hand.)

846

Those who believed in Siva have all become the share of the earth. Why
then these disputes and [discrimination](errata.htm#159.md) of Gods. All
the faithful to Vishnu have fallen to the shares of white ashes.

847

It is impracticable to dress oblations for however great a God, without
imbibing the favour (or scent). Thus he has your leavings while ye talk
of "devoting and setting aside as holy". Ye are still biting your lips
at it.

848

The fool deceived becomes a devotee to Siva and submitted to slavish
tasks. But the wise, an honoured, (badged) soldier is ever void of fear.

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

849

The skill of the laundress (who recognised the owner of each vest) is
more than that of the bookworm. Better is a dog than Ganesha the dumpy
king; noble is truth than all the Gods in the world.

850

If we know ourselves, the Veda would be all fooling to us; a mizzling
rain is all folly to the store of grain; publish thou in the world O
Vema that the six *sastras*, and the Puranas are mere infelicity.

851

All those of the race of Brahma are fallen creatures. Those of the race
of Rishies are ruined. Will they call near them these hateful wretches
nor detest them.

852

Consider the words of Vemana as those of a mad man. Some fall into
channels and some into streams (proverb); but a small proportion of them
are removed out of the (Veda Sastra) scriptural level.

853

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

In the thousand verses thus composed by Vemadu, many as are the bad,
equally numerous are the good. Secrecy gives a charm to beauty and
obscurity to wisdom; should not a lovely girl lie exposed naked on the
couch.

854

Like mad foxes do the Bramins read the Veda perpetually howling it out.
They know not its meanings. But Vemana knows the entire essence of the
Vedas.

855

All *yagnas* were invented for the sake of discovering the fornications
of a wife and the periodical ceremonies to the end of knowing a mother's
adulteries In so vile a way was the chapter of ceremonies invented.

*Note*: At commencing the sacrifice called *yagna* the performer must
require his wife to confess whether she has been untrue to him. The
periodical ceremonies being performed to the late husband of a widow
lead to the conviction, at least in her own mind, of her having been
true or adulterous.

856

The height of excellence is to abstain from slaying. Thus say the
Bramins, lords of earth and still commit slaughter of animals in
sacrifice. Better is the *chandala* who devours dead cattle.

857

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

They pinch and scrub their halters (nose ropes) and rub themselves to
remove all dirt, and pour water into their privities. By thus cleansing
the whole body do they attain felicity.

858

Pauper Bramins meet together and recite [babbling](errata.htm#160.md)
charms and talk saying they will perform the initiation of a boy into
their caste. Like the crow that has drunk the washing of rice and goes
on crowing.

859

Why take thy caste and pride thyself on it? Yea and what is the (twice
born) Brahmin?

860

If ignorant of service how can they become slaves? Ignorant of the
Vaishnava belief how can ye be Vaishnavite? While living, why do ye
suffer burning like corpses? (i.e., smear [yourselves](errata.htm#161.md)
with ashes)

861

If the pollutions caused by a birth or a death be real, and if the
qualities communicated by that touch be destroyed to what end is it for
a soul to become a hermit.

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

862

Shall the wicked, being produced through carnal desire, talking vainly,
with false words and deceiving men and twisting about to get money,
shall such a one become a teacher?

863

Unable to discern that this world is a delusion, some talk of the smock
and some of the langoti. These are mere tricks of the privities.

864

The noble Brahmin goes to eat the vile funeral cakes of the ruined
wretch. The Brahmin's wife haunts the marriage house; first they lose
caste and then character.

865

In the night of ignorance doth the goddess of delusion wear her
petticoat and conceal herself; in the daytime of wisdom, when about her
work she looses her [petticoat](errata.htm#162.md); this is no prostitute
but an edged sword in the hand.

866

They are puffed up and cry I will perform a sacrifice, these who fill
their bellies with the liquor vulva, these sons of whore brag nobly in
their assemblies.

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

867

He calls men sudras and says begone thou sudra; this is a pariar worse
than a pariar. If he says I am a twice born does he thereby become one?

868

Born and dying in ignorance of his prior state before all men, are they
ensnared by their lusts? To what end do they leave wisdom and roam the
earth.

869

These heroes--the Brahmins, Kshatrias and Vaisyas and Brahma, Vishnu and
Siva all these are beasts. Ignorant of the divinity have they adopted
forms thus diversified,

870

Defilement appears no where in the least but exists in our ideas;
whoever considers it will see that the beauty of the world is in truth
extreme. If thy ignorance depart, wisdom shall shine with thee.

871

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

Those who abuse the practice of wearing ashes on the forehead, that is,
the Vaishnavites yet perform their funerals with fire and thus become
the portion of the fire. They the Saivites who equally abuse the wearing
of earth, by burying their dead become earth.

Thus the advantage of all their mutual abuse discovers itself in their
shame,

872

However great the spell be, not even Brahma can utter it undefiled with
spittle. But with what mouth is it they talk of spittle and defilement
[thereby](errata.htm#163.md).

873

While the fire in our body is ignited and burns, to what end do (the
Vaishnavites) burn their corpses. By merely burning does he become
mighty?

874

To put cord over the neck as the Lingamites and then to suppose that
their soodra-ism has departed, this is mere (inferior sense) folly; if
thy mind be not settled, will a cord give thee caste?

875

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

Wearing a silk vest and putting the Vaishnavite streak on their
forehead, the Vaishnava sect has exalted its head in the earth. By the
contrivance of numberless fopperies has the Vishnava sect been ruined.

876

If thou eat the body of a beast that eats pure grass they call you a
pariar. Yet if he eat fowls and pigs (which are the foulest of feeders)
a man is called wise.

877

If you go seasonably to the abode of Ranga (in the Cauveri) you will
find the charming smell of toddy. Truly this is scorn of the lord of the
world. (The Vaishnavites drink toddy while worshipping.)

878

In the house of the body a wild fire blazes with hunger; why should you
burn your bodies? This is mere deception or perhaps this is punishment
inflicted on the Dasoos. (This is a sneer at Vaishnavites.)

879

They find fault with the well used by the village and are delighted with
the water in which a holy man's feet have been washed. What profit is
there in foot washings?

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

880

Those who understand omens and the interpretation of moles, are not to
be met with in the Iron age. For their own profit men will explain the
virtue of these. In cases where fortune meets us, these are accepted as
its tokens.

881

A parcel of old whores (windows) join together in this age and through
devotion to Siva forsooth go on dancing. Shall such hypocrisy obtain
them felicity.

882

He who cannot at first apply himself to restrain his passions, when he
dies, seeks to become a devotee; void of purity of heart, how should
beatitude appertain to him.

883

He who has learnt to die, all his turning sanyasi is merely as though he
at last lost his caste; the sin of doing this alone is certain. There is
no ulterior profit in it.

884

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

The leaving (spittle) of a pretty white dog are pure in our eyes. The
spittle of a young dancing girl is acceptable to us. These vile leavings
are precious everywhere. Then why are the leavings of those we love evil
in our sight.

885

However much you wash it well, (does) the defilement of the mouth
depart? That alone is a mouth (which does not speak falsehood); that
daily speak falsehood is not a mouth but a mouth below.

886

Binding the linga fairly on their body, but unable to fix his faith on
that lingam, failing of beatitude, they perish in their folly.

887

All those who trust in Vishnu fall to the share of white earth; to what
end are these disputes and sects (dissensions) in religion. The
Lingadharies become the portion of earth,

888

When he proceeds from his mother's womb, had he a lingam along with him?
Then what a joke it is for him to wear one afterwards.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

889

The Vaishnava sect puts on a silk turban and silk vest, and is puffed up
in the earth. These are mere semblances and the emptiness of the
Vaishnava creed,

890

Unable to know the great secret, they continue and frame religions, and
merely give sorrow to each other, like as a dog that is agitated at the
sight of a mirror,

891

You see that those endowed with form all possess the first image. Why
should ye value this man or that as a superior. If ignorant of this
principle, how shall he attain happiness?

892

A pariar eats flesh, all other people eat fat--are not they one caste?
They do not see that all castes are in fact one.

893

Why dost again and again abuse a pariar? Are not his blood and flesh and
thine one? Of what caste is he who is immingled with him? The deity
animates his entire works.

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

894

When people see those who wear ashes they imagine that they contract
inequity from them. When they see the Namadharies (Vaishnavities) they
consider it healing. What are the ashes, and what the white clay (of the
Vaishnavites) in the eyes of the supreme.

895

Those who are divided into sects are ten thousands. This is merely for
filling their bellies--they cannot see the divine spirit. Can cranes
however many they assemble, devour ships?

896

By slaughtering the animals that eat grass men become pariars in the
earth. But what sort of caste is that, that eats pigs and fowls (as the
respectable classes do) that devour the dung of all?

897

If men in the earth choose to take pipe clay and soften it well, then
put it smoothly on their foreheads it is merely a mark, and thereby men
cannot become Vaishnavites.

898

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

Though thou put on the mark and call thyself a (servant) *adiya* as the
Vaishnavites do and eat chewed pawn, bow down and call thyself a
*Dasee*--This is all merely a means of subsistence but no ground for
happiness.

899

We see that men are like barber's basin, common to all; then, while they
thus are mingled, why babble about their castes. Put thy right hand on
their heads and expose this to their ridicule,
