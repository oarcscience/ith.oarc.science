# PREFACE TO VEMANA

This author has attained great celebrity in his own country and in the
adjacent parts of India; some information regarding his country and
language may however be acceptable to the reader.

Telugu is a principal language of the peninsula of India. It is ancient;
and has been highly cultivated. The nation of the Telugus was in former
times very powerful, and its princes gave considerable encouragement to
literature. The works of its ancient poets are numerous and very
voluminous. It possesses a very scientific grammar, and a system of
prosody nearly as highly polished as that of the Greeks. In this and
some other respects the language is acknowledged to be more difficult
than Sanscrit.

It is peculiarly smooth and elegant in its sound, and the poets have
cautiously preserved its euphony. Hence Europeans have called it the
Italian of India. The student may at first think this remark, which is
no new one, unfounded; as the pronunciation is strong and decided; and
as the mixture of Sanscrit terms often gives it a degree of roughness.
But the pure rustic dialect as well as that of the poets is altogether
different from this colloquial language; in the pure dialect most of
those Sanscrit words that had harsh sounds are softened till they are as
smooth and melodious as pure Telugu.

With Sanscrit it is closely connected; as closely as English is with
Latin. But at the same time it is as truly original and nearly as
copious as English. Like English it has borrowed its scientific terms
from another tongue; and these Sanscrit additions are daily increasing.
Thus the language is becoming less pure.

During the eighteenth century, the incursions of the Mohamedans
effectually crushed the literature of Telangana; it has fallen low; and
the colloquial dialect has become equally corrupt--men are now rarely
met with among them who can

<span id="page_ii">p. ii</span>

read or explain the classical authors of the language; a knowledge of
prosody is yet more rare.

Twenty five years of peace in Telangana under the British government
have now afforded opportunities for some revival of literature. The
establishment of the Honourable Company's College at Madras, and the
encouragement there held out to good scholars in the language may have
effected some revival; but much remains yet to be done. No poem or
classical composition in Telugu has hitherto been
[printed](errata.htm#0.md); and I believe no translation of a classic into
English has been [attempted](errata.htm#1.md).

It now remains to give some account of my author, VEMANA, whose writings
are peculiarly useful to those who study the language, the style being
simple, and the variety of topics very extensive. These adages exemplify
thousands of words inadmissible into more dignified poetry. The thought
and connection are often abstruse while the terms used are quite
familiar.

Of his history, little is known. He was not a Bramin but a *Capoo*, or
farmer; a native of the Cuddapa district and born, I believe, in the
neighbourhood of Gandicotta. He lived in the beginning of the eighteenth
century. It is said that in verse 707 he has fixed the date of birth
which is believed to have been his own. This date coincides with A. D.
1652. The date is given in the cycle of sixty years; but which cycle is
intended is unknown. Many verses, however, prove satisfactorily that he
wrote in the latter part of the seventeenth century when the Mohamedans
were [governors](errata.htm#2.md) of that part of India. His family was
powerful, but he renounced the world and became a *sanyasee* or ascetic.
He calls himself a *Yogee*.

These verses communicate hardly any idea of his history or connections,
and like all solitary ascetics (*sanyasees* or *yogee*) he has dropped
his family name--calling himself simply Vema or Vemana at pleasure. This
solitary life has led him to address all the verses to himself, which,
if this be not recollected, certainly looks like the grossest egotism.
This practice is far indeed from being peculiar to Vemana.

\[The name Vema and Vemana do not appear to be used by the Telugus of
the present day. Vema or Vemana in Sanscrit

<span id="page_iii">p. iii</span>

signify a loom. (see Wilson's Sanscrit Lexicon, page 854, and the
Sabdartha Calpataru Vol. II, page 199). I believe these names to have
been practical titles alone, without a definite meaning. Thus it is well
[known](errata.htm#3.md) that the titles or names of Dante and Hafiz were
not the original names of those poets; the first of whom was named
Durante or Durando (see preface to Cary's Dante) and the second Muhammed
Shemsuddin\].

These poems have attained very great popularity and parts are found
translated into Tamil and Malayalam or Canarese. Their terse
[closeness](errata.htm#4.md) of expression sometimes renders them difficult
to translate with elegance; but such passages exemplify the manly force
of a language that in the common dialect is often weak and verbose.

Of his aphorisms many have become common proverbs. Parts of them are
evidently close translations from Sanscrit works, particularly the
*Hitopadesa* and *Bhagavat Gita*. In a few of these every word is pure
Sanscrit.

Vemana was evidently, in philosophy, of the Vedanta school, a disciple
of Vyasa, whom Sir William Jones has (in the Asiatic Researches, Vol I,
page 362) entitled the Plato of India. With the mystic tenets of Plato,
those of Vemana closely correspond while his moral doctrines as closely
answer to those of Democritus.

These verses are chiefly of three classes: moral, satirical and mystic
In the morals, many verses occur, breathing a spirit of devotion truly
extraordinary in a Hindu. The satirical part is chiefly directed against
the national religion and customs particularly against Bramins. None of
it is personal. The mystic portion is chiefly of use as exemplifying the
powers of the language. The reveries contained in this chapter are of a
strangely abstruse nature and furnish a remarkable instance of a
powerful mind searching for the light of truth which is lost in the
darkness of heathen ignorance. The style of this and some other parts
renders it easier to translate the verses into Latin than into English.
I have, however, left none in Latin (aliess) that
[appeared](errata.htm#5) to deserve an [English](errata.htm#6.md) one. To
the more difficult verses I have subjoined a Telugu interpretation For
some parts of this comment written in Telugu, I am indebted to two very

<span id="page_iv">p. iv</span>

learned Bramins who taught me the language, its grammar and prosody.
They are Tippabhotla Venkata Siva Sastri of Masulipatnam and Advyta
Brahmia, the Pandit belonging to the court in which I have the honour of
being assistant judge.

To the mystic portion I have appended such notes as appeared requisite.
Further elucidations of the most ample nature will be found in the
Bhagavat Gita, with Dr. Wilkins's commentary and in Sir William Jones's
essay on the Mystical poetry. Poetry of the East appears in the third
volume of the Asiatic Researches; It would be easy to refer to many
other authors; but to save the reader trouble in an enquiry that can
gratify nothing but curiosity, I have subjoined a short explanation of
the system.

Most of the Verses in Vemana are written in a *ataveladi* metre which
consists of four lines; but the fourth line, with some exceptions, is a
mere refrain or chorus in these words--*Viswadabhirama Vinura Vema*.

It is perhaps impossible to meet with a complete copy of this poet in a
manuscript of any antiquity. The principal sources from which this
edition is compiled are nine. These were collected from Bellary, Cuddapa
Madras, Vijagpatnam, and the city in which I wrote. Few of these copies
contain above five hundred verses, none came up to seven hundred. The
number, however, that I have succeeded in collecting is 2,100.

Of the state of the manuscripts, it is not easy to give a correct idea.
Errors of the grossest nature in orthography, metre and rhyme deface
every line; and erroneous words are substituted to elicit a sense that
the transcribers thought proper to prefer. Thus they have eluded many of
the difficulties in thought or expression; and the corruption is
indescribable in verse.

Vemana having written the *tadbhava* word *guramu* (for gruhamu) a
house, the copyists in defiance of metre and meaning have *gurramu*, a
horse.

To remedy such errors I prepared a general index to my manuscripts,
showing the place each verse occupies in each copy. For the verses in no
two copies had the same arrangement. By

<span id="page_v">p. v</span>

this aid, the true reading has, I hope, seldom been lost. the correct
metre I trust never--the [most](errata.htm#7.md) frequent corruptions were
substitutions of Sanscrit terms in defiance of measure, for pure Telugu
expressions.

To the remarks on mystic philosophy, I have subjoined a short
explanation of Telugu prosody. The statements are taken from the
*Bheemana* *Chandassu*, but the arrangement and mode of explanation are
my own. Sir William Jones has remarked (As. Res 1-XVII on Panini) that
"since grammar is only an instrument, and not the end of true knowledge,
there can be little occasion to travel so rough and gloomy a path." To
teach myself The science, I was obliged to reduce the rules given by
Bheemana in a very fantastic from to their real import; and a mode then
[occurred](errata.htm#8.md) to me through which by degrees I learnt the
whole with care. The original is so mysteriously complex that the
failure of most aspirants even among Bramins to a knowledge of prosody
is not surprising.
