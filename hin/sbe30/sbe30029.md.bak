### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 7.

1. <span id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_317) Now (follows.md) the *S*rava*n*â
ceremony.

2\. It has to be performed on the full-moon day (of the month
*S*râva*n*a).

3\. Having besmeared (a surface) to the east of the house (with
cow-dung), they carry forward (to that place) fire taken from the
(sacred) domestic fire.

4\. He besmears four spots to the four sides (of the fire),

5\. Towards the (four) directions,

6\. (To the extent) of more than one prakrama (i.e. step).

7\. He puts a dish on the fire and fries (in that

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

dish) one handful of barley-grains, without burning them.

8. <span id="fr_318"></span>[8](#fn_318.md) To the west of the fire he
places a mortar so that it stands firmly, and husks (the grains),
separating (the husked and the unhusked grains?).

9\. After he has carefully ground them to flour, and has thrown (that)
into a wooden cup (*k*amasa), and covered it with a winnowing-basket, he
puts it up (in the house).

10\. Between (the besmeared surface) towards the south, and that towards
the east (there should be) a passage.

11. <span id="fr_319"></span>[11](#fn_319.md) After sunset he takes the
wooden cup, (the spoon called) Darvi, and the winnowing-basket, and goes
to (the fire) which has been carried forward (Sûtra 3).

12\. He throws the flour into the winnowing-basket and fills the wooden
cup with water.

13\. He takes once a quantity of flour with the Darvi spoon, pours out
water on the besmeared place to the east (of the fire), and offers
(there) a Bali with (the words), 'O king of Serpents, dwelling towards
the east, this is thy Bali!' (MB. II, 1, 1).

14\. He pours the rest of the water over (that Bali, taking care) that
it does not carry away the Bali.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

15. <span id="fr_320"></span>[15](#fn_320.md) Turning round from right to
left, he besprinkles the wooden cup and the Darvi spoon, warms them, and
(repeats the offering of a Bali) in the same way towards the south,
towards the west, and towards the north, as the Mantra (MB. II, I, 1. 2)
runs, without turning away (between the single Bali-offerings).

16. <span id="fr_321"></span>[16](#fn_321.md) After he has thrown the
remnants (of flour) out of the basket into the fire, he goes to that
fire which has not been carried forward.

17. <span id="fr_322"></span>[17](#fn_322.md) To the west of that fire he
touches the earth with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the
Mantra, 'Adoration to the Earth’s'—(MB. II, 1, 3).

18\. In the evening boiled rice-grains with milk (are prepared).

19\. Of that (milk-rice) he should make oblations with (the formulas),
'To *S*rava*n*a, to Vish*n*u, to Agni, to Pra*g*âpati, to the Vi*s*ve
devâs Svâhâ!'

20. <span id="fr_323"></span>[20](#fn_323.md) The rest (should be
performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

21\. To the north of the fire he places a bunch of Darbha grass with
roots, and murmurs the Mantra, 'Soma the king' (ibid. 4), and, 'The
agreement which you have made' (ibid. 5).

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

22\. On the following day he has flour of fried barley-grains prepared,
and in a new pot, covering (it with another pot), he puts it up (in his
house).

23. <span id="fr_324"></span>[23](#fn_324) (Of that flour.md) he should
silently offer Balis day by day in the evening, before the sacrifice,
until the Âgrahâya*n*î day.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[90:11](sbe30029.htm#fr_319.md) According to the
commentary atipra*n*îta means the fire which has been carried forward
(Sûtra 3). Another explanation is then added, which is based on a
quotation from a 'tantrântara:' 'After he has established a fire, he
should carry forward one firebrand taken from that fire, in a
south-eastern direction, with the Mantra ye rûpâ*n*i pratimu*ñk*amânâ*h*
&c.; that fire is the atipra*n*îta fire.'

cut off (the Avadânas with the Sru*k*).' Comp. Gobhila I, 8, 3 seq.
