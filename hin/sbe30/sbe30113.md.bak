Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 7, SECTION 20.

1. <span id="fr_785"></span>[1](#fn_785.md) With the next (verse, II, 18,
10) he has the Î*s*âna led to the southern (hut),

2\. With worldly words the 'bountiful goddess' to the northern (hut),

3\. To the middle (between the two huts) the 'conqueror.'

4\. He gives them water to drink in the same order in which they have
been led (to their places), takes three portions of boiled rice (from
the Sthâlîpâka prepared for Î*s*âna), takes (these portions of rice) to
the fire, makes (the three gods) touch them with the next (formulas, II,
18, II-13), sacrifices of these portions, to each god of the portion
which belongs to him, with the next (formulas, II, 18, 14-30), cuts off
(Avadânas) from all (portions), and sacrifices with the next Ya*g*us
(II, 18, 31) to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

5\. Having worshipped (the god Î*s*âna) with the next Ya*g*us (II, 18,
32), he distributes with the next (formulas, II, 18, 33-39) leaves
together with portions of boiled rice, two (leaves) with each (Ya*g*us),
then ten to the divine hosts (II, 18, 40), and ten to the (divine hosts)
that follow (and are referred to in the next Ya*g*us, II, 18, 41).

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

6\. With the next (formulas, II, 18, 42-45) he does the same as before
(i.e. he distributes two leaves with each Mantra).

7\. Having formed a lump of boiled rice, he puts it into a basket of
leaves, and with the next Ya*g*us (II, 18, 46) hangs it up on a tree.

8\. Here he should murmur the Rudra texts (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 5),

9\. Or the first and last (Anuvâka).

10\. He places his cows around the fire so that the smoke (of the
sacrifice) may reach them.

11. <span id="fr_786"></span>[11](#fn_786.md) With his firmly shut fist
full of Darbha grass he besprinkles (them) with scents; the bull first.

12\. He should perform a sacrifice to Kshetrapati, without a fire, in
the path used by his cows.

13\. He has (the Kshetrapati) led to his place in the same way as the
Î*s*âna (see above, Sûtra 1).

14\. He puts (portions of boiled rice) into four or seven leaves, naming
(the god).

15. <span id="fr_787"></span>[15](#fn_787.md) Let him sacrifice quickly;
the god has a strong digestion (?).

16\. With the next two (verses, II, 18, 47. 48) he does worship (to
Kshetrapati).

17\. The Sthâlîpâka (belonging to Î*s*âna) he gives to the Brâhma*n*as
to eat;

18\. That belonging to Kshetrapati his uterine relations eat,

19\. Or as is the custom in their family.
