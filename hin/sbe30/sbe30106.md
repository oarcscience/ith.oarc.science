### PA*T*ALA 5, SECTION 13.

1\. Now this (is) another (way for performing the Samâvartana). He
bathes silently at a bathing-place and puts silently a piece of wood on
(the fire).

2. <span id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_765.md) He sits down on a bunch of
grass, as stated above (comp. M. II, 9, 7), at a place where they are
going to honour him (with the Argha reception).

3\. A king and a chieftain (sit down) in the same way (as a Brâhma*n*a),
with the next two (formulas, M. II, 9, 8. 9), according to the
characteristics (contained in them).

4\. (The host) announces (to the guest), 'The water for washing the
feet!'

5. <span id="fr_766"></span>[5](#fn_766) (The guest.md) should recite the
next (verse, II, 9, 10) over (that water) and should stretch out the
right foot first to a Brâhma*n*a, the left to a *S*ûdra.

6\. Having touched the person who washes him, he should touch himself
(i.e. his own heart) with the next (formula, M. II, 9, II).

7\. (The host, taking the Argha water) in an

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

earthen vessel which he holds with two bunches of grass, announces (to
the guest), 'The Argha water!'

8\. (The guest) should recite the next (formula, II, 9, 12) over (that
water) and should murmur the next Ya*g*us (II, 9, 13), while a part (of
the water) is poured over his joined hands.

9\. Over the rest (of the water) which is poured out towards the east,
he recites the next (verse, M. II, 9, 14).

10\. (The host) pours together curds and honey in a brass vessel, covers
it with a larger (brass cover), takes hold of it with two bunches of
grass, and announces (to the guest), 'The honey-mixture!'

11\. Some take three substances, (those stated before) and ghee.

12\. Some take five, (the three stated before), and grains, and flour.

13\. The guest recites the next two (formulas, M. II, 10, 1. 2) over
(the honey-mixture) and sips water with the two Ya*g*us (II, 10, 3. 4)
before (eating) and afterwards; with the next (verse, II, 10, 5) he
should partake three times (of the food) and should give the remainder
to a person towards whom he is kindly disposed.

14\. A king or a chieftain should only accept it and (give it) to his
Purohita.

15\. (The host) announces the cow with (the word), 'The cow!'

16\. After the guest has recited the next (formula, M. II, 10, 6) over
(the cow, the host) cools its omentum, and having performed the
'spreading under' and the sprinkling over (of Â*g*ya), he sacrifices it
with the next (verse, M. II, 10, 7) with a Palâ*s*a leaf from the middle
or the end (of the stalk).

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

17\. If the guest chooses to let (the cow) loose, he murmurs the next
(formulas, II, 10, 8-11) in a low voice (and says) loudly, 'Om! Let it
loose!' (II, 10, 12).

18\. (In this case) he recites the next (formulas, M. II, 10, 13-17) in
a low voice over the food which is announced to him (instead of the
cow), (and says) loudly, 'Om! Make it ready!' (II, 10, 18).

19\. For his teacher, for a *Ri*tvi*g*, for his father-in-law, for a
king he ought to perform this (Arghya ceremony) as often as they visit
his house, if at least one year has elapsed (since they came last).

20\. For a renowned teacher (of the Veda the ceremony should be
performed) once.
