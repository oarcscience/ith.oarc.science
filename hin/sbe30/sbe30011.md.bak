------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 8.

1\. To the east (is placed) the Â*g*ya, to the west the mess of cooked
food.

2. <span id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_158) Having sprinkled (water.md) round
(the fire) and poured Â*g*ya on the mess of cooked food, he begins to
sacrifice simply with the pot-ladle, picking out portions of the
sacrificial food (without 'underspreading' and pouring Â*g*ya over the
Havis).

3. <span id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_159.md) If he intends, however, to
sacrifice so as to 'underspread' (the Havis with Â*g*ya) and to pour
(Â*g*ya) over it, let him sacrifice first the two Â*g*ya portions (in
the following way):

4\. He should take four portions of Â*g*ya—five portions (are taken) by
the Bh*ri*gus—and should sacrifice from west to east, on the northern
side with (the formula), 'To Agni Svâhâ!' on the southern side with (the
words), 'To Soma Svâhâ!'

5\. He then cuts off (two or three Avadânas) from the Havis, having
'spread under' (Â*g*ya).

6. <span id="fr_160"></span>[6](#fn_160) (Two Avadânas.md) from the middle
and from the east side, if he (belongs to the families who) make

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

four Avadânas. (Three Avadânas) from the middle, from the east and from
the west side, if (he belongs to those who) make five Avadânas.

7. <span id="fr_161"></span>[7](#fn_161) He sprinkles (Â*g*ya.md) on the
cut-off portions.

8\. He anoints the places from which he has cut them off (with Â*g*ya)
in order that the strength (of the Havis) may not be lost.

9\. He should sacrifice over the middle of the fire with (the words),
'To Agni Svâhâ!'—

10\. Once or thrice, in that same way.

11. <span id="fr_162"></span>[11](#fn_162.md) Now for the Svish*t*ak*ri*t
(oblation), after having 'spread under' (Â*g*ya), he cuts off once a
very big (Avadâna) from the eastern part of the northern part (of the
Havis), Twice he should sprinkle (Â*g*ya) on it.

12\. But if he (belongs to the families who) make five Avadânas, he
should 'spread under' twice, and cut off (the Avadâna), and sprinkle
(Â*g*ya) on it twice.

13. <span id="fr_163"></span>[13](#fn_163.md) He does not anoint the place
from which he has cut off, in order that the strength (of the Havis) may
be lost.

14. <span id="fr_164"></span>[14](#fn_164.md) With the words, 'To Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Svâhâ!' he should
sacrifice it over the eastern part of the northern part (of the fire).

15. <span id="fr_165"></span>[15](#fn_165.md) He should sacrifice oblations
of Â*g*ya on (the chief oblations of cooked sacrificial food), with the
Mahâvyâh*ri*tis.

16. <span id="fr_166"></span>[16](#fn_166) The insertion (stands.md) before
the Svish*t*ak*ri*t (oblation).

17\. If different sacrifices are performed together, there is only one
sweeping (of the ground) round (the fire) (chap. 3, 1), one (putting of)
fuel (on the fire) (chap. 7, 19), one Barhis, one sprinkling (of water)
round (the fire) (chap. 8, 2), one Â*g*ya, and one offering of the two
Â*g*yabhâgas (chap. 8, 3).

18\. Having cut off (the Avadânas) for all (the single sacrifices), he
sacrifices the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation only once.

19. <span id="fr_167"></span>[19](#fn_167.md) After he has sacrificed, he
should throw that pot-ladle (which he has used in the preceding
ceremonies) into the fire.

20\. Or having washed it, he should take with it (the rest of the
sacrificial food), and should eat that.

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

21\. The Sruva he should not throw into the fire, say some (teachers).

22. <span id="fr_168"></span>[22](#fn_168.md) By one who has not set up the
sacred fires, the mess of cooked food should be offered to Agni at the
festivals both of the full and of the new moon.

23\. To Agni, or to Agni and Soma, by one who has set them up, at the
full-moon (sacrifice);

24\. To Indra, or to Indra and Agni, or to Mahendra, at the new-moon
(sacrifice).

25\. Or also one who has set up the sacred fires, should offer it to
Agni at the festivals both of the full and of the new moon.

26. <span id="fr_169"></span>[26](#fn_169.md) Having put a piece of wood
(on the fire), and having afterwards sprinkled (water) round (the fire),
he performs the Ya*gñ*avâstu ceremony (in the following way):

27. <span id="fr_170"></span>[27](#fn_170.md) From that same Barhis he
should take a handful of Kura grass, and should dip it thrice into the
Â*g*ya or into the Havis, the points, the middle, and the roots, with
(the words), 'May the birds come, licking what has been anointed.'

28\. He then should besprinkle that (handful of grass) with water, and
should throw it into the fire with (the verse), 'Thou who art the lord
of cattle, Rudra, who walkest with the lines (of cattle), the manly one:
do no harm to our cattle; let this be offered to thee! Svâhâ!

29\. This (ceremony) they call Ya*gñ*avâstu.

35</span> the Abhighâra*n*a (Sûtra 7) are reckoned as two Avadânas, so
that they form together with the two or three portions cut off from the
Havis, four or five Avadânas respectively. On the difference of the
families regarding the number of Avadânas, comp. Weber, Indische
Studien, X, 95.

corresponding regulations of the *S*rauta ritual at Hillebrandt, Neu-
and Vollmondsopfer, 117-119.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[35:13](sbe30011.htm#fr_163.md) The same rule
re-occurs in the *S*rauta ritual; Hillebrandt, l.l. 117, note 8.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[35:14](sbe30011.htm#fr_164.md) The expression
used here uttarârdhapûrvârdhe is also found in most of the corresponding
passages of the *S*rauta ritual, <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> given
by Hillebrandt, l.l. 119, note 3. The Khâdira-G*ri*hya has
prâgudî*k*yâm.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[36:15](sbe30011.htm#fr_165.md) If the chief
oblations consist in Â*g*ya, they are both preceded and followed by the
Mahâvyâh*ri*ti oblations. See below, chap. 9, Sûtra 27.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[36:16](sbe30011.htm#fr_166.md) On the âvâpa (i.e.
the special characteristic offerings of each sacrifice) see
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 9, 12, and the note there (vol. xxix, p. 28).

<span id="fn_167"></span>[36:19](sbe30011.htm#fr_167.md) According to the
commentary, etad would belong to sauvish*t*ak*ri*tam (Sûtra 18): 'After
he has sacrificed that, he should throw the pot-ladle into the fire.'
The comparison of Baudhâyana 1, 17, 23, atraitan meksha*n*am
âhavanîve<sup>ऽ</sup>nupraharati (Hillebrandt, p. 119, note 3), shows
that the commentary is wrong, and that etad belongs to meksha*n*am.

Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 2, 1-4.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[37:27](sbe30011.htm#fr_170.md) The expression
tata eva barhisha*h* has occurred already at chap. 7, 21. The Mantra
re-occurs in Vâ*g*. Sa*m*hitâ II. 16 e, &c.
