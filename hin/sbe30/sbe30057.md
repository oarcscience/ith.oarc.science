*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

### PA*T*ALA 4, SECTION 14.

1\. And should, after that person has eaten, seize his right hand,

2. <span id="fr_581"></span>[2](#fn_581) If he wishes that one of his
companions, or a pupil, or a servant should faithfully remain with him
and not go away, he should bathe in the morning, should put on clean
garments, should show

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

patience (with that servant, &c.) during the day, should speak (only)
with Brâhma*n*as, and by night he should go to the dwelling-place of
that person, should make water into a horn of a living animal, and
should three times walk round his dwelling-place, sprinkling (his urine)
round it, with (the Mantra), 'From the mountain (I sever?) thee, from
thy brother, from thy sister, from all thy relations. parishîda*h*
kleshyati (i.e. kvaishyasi?) *s*a*s*vat parikupilena
sa*m*krâme*n*âvi*kkh*idâ, ûlena parimî*dh*o<sup>ऽ</sup>si
parimî*dh*o<sup>ऽ</sup>sy ûlena.'

3\. He puts down the horn of the living animal in a place which is
generally accessible.

4. <span id="fr_582"></span>[4](#fn_582) One whose companions, pupils,
or servants use to run away, should rebuke them with (the Mantra), 'May
he who calls hither (?), call you hither! He who brings back, has
brought you back (?). May the rebuke of Indra always rebuke you. If you,
who worship your own deceit, despise me (?), . . . . may Indra bind you
with his bond, and may he drive you back again to me.'

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

5\. Then he enters his house, puts a piece of Sidhraka wood on (the
fire), and sacrifices with the 'on-drawing verse,' 'Back-bringer, bring
them back' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. III, 3, 10, 1).

6\. Now (we shall explain) how one should guard his wife.

7. <span id="fr_583"></span>[7](#fn_583) One whose wife has a paramour,
should grind big centipedes (?) to powder, and should insert (that
powder), while his wife is sleeping, into her secret parts, with the
Mantra, 'Indra. . . . from other men than me.'

8\. Now (follows the sacrifice for procuring) prosperity in trade.

9\. He cuts off (some portion) from (every) article of trade and
sacrifices it—

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_581"></span>[175:2](sbe30057.htm#fr_581) 14, 2.
Mât*ri*datta: 'The description of the Samâvartana is finished. <span
id="page_176">p. 176</span> Now some ceremonies connected with special
wishes of the person who has performed the Samâvartana and has settled
in a house, will be described.' In my opinion, it would be more correct
to consider Sûtra 18 of the preceding section as the last of the
aphorisms that regard the Samâvartana, With Sûtra 2 compare Pâraskara
III, 7; Âpastamba VIII, 23, 6. It seems impossible to attempt to
translate the hopelessly corrupt last lines of the Mantra.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[176:4](sbe30057.htm#fr_582) A part of this
Mantra also is most corrupt. In the first line I propose to write,
nivarto vo nyavîv*ri*tat. With the last line comp. Pâraskara III, 7, 3.
I think that the text of Pâraskara should be corrected in the following
way: pari tvâ hvalano hvalan nivartas tvâ nyavîv*ri*tat, indra*h*
pâ*s*ena sitvâ tvâ mahyam . . . (three syllables) ânayet. The
Âpastambîya Mantrapâ*th*a, according to Dr. Winternitz's copy, gives the
following text: anupohvad anuhvayo vivartto <span id="page_177">p.
177</span> vo nyavîv*ri*dhat. aindra*h* parikro*s*o to va*h*
parikro*s*atu sarvata*h*. yadi mâm atimanyâdvâ â devâ devavattara
indra*h* pâ*s*ena *s*itkvâ vo mahyam id va*s*am ânayât svâhâ. Comp.
Prof. Pischel's remarks, Philologische Abhandlungen, Martin Hertz zum
siebzigsten Geburtstage von ehemaligen Schülern dargebracht (Berlin,
1888), p. 69 seq.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[177:7](sbe30057.htm#fr_583) On sthûrâ
dri*dh*â\[*h*\] Mât*ri*datta says, sthûrâ d*ridh*â*h* sthûrâ*h*
*s*atapadya*h*. A part of the Mantra is untranslatable on account of the
very corrupt condition of the text. The reading given by most of the
MSS. is, Indrâya yâsya *s*epham alikam anyebhya*h*
purushebhyo<sup>ऽ</sup>nyatra mat. The Âpastambîya Mantrapâ*th*a reads,
indrâyâsya phaligam anyebhya*h* purushebhyonyatra mat. The meaning very
probably is that Indra is invoked to keep away from the woman the
*s*epha of all other men except her husband's.
