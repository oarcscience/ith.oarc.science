# G*RI*HYA-SÛTRA OF HIRA*N*YAKE*S*IN.

### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 1, SECTION 1.

1\. We shall explain the Upanayana (i.e. the initiation of the student).

2. <span id="fr_454"></span>[2](#fn_454.md) Let him initiate a Brâhma*n*a
at the age of seven years,

3\. A Râ*g*anya, of eleven, a Vai*s*ya, of twelve.

4. <span id="fr_455"></span>[4](#fn_455.md) A Brâhma*n*a in the spring, a
Râ*g*anya in the summer, a Vai*s*ya in the autumn.

5\. In the time of the increasing moon, under an auspicious
constellation, preferably (under a constellation) the name of which is
masculine,

6. <span id="fr_456"></span>[6](#fn_456.md) He should serve food to an even
number of Brâhma*n*as and should cause them to say, 'An auspicious day!
Hail! Good luck!'—

7\. (Then he) should have the boy satiated, should

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

have his hair shaven, and after (the boy) has bathed and has been decked
with ornaments—

8\. He should dress him in a (new) garment which has not yet been
washed.

9. <span id="fr_457"></span>[9](#fn_457.md) In a place inclined towards the
east, (or) inclined towards the north, (or) inclined towards northeast,
or in an even (place), he raises (the surface on which he intends to
sacrifice), sprinkles it with water,

10\. Kindles fire by attrition, or fetches common (worldly) fire, puts
the fire down, and puts wood on the fire.

11. <span id="fr_458"></span>[11](#fn_458.md) He strews eastward-pointed
Darbha grass round the fire;

12\. Or (the grass which is strewn) to the west and to the east (of the
fire), may be northward-pointed.

13. <span id="fr_459"></span>[13](#fn_459.md) He (arranges the Darbha
blades so as to) lay the southern (blades) uppermost, the northern ones
below, if their points are turned (partly) towards the east and (partly)
towards the north.

14. <span id="fr_460"></span>[14](#fn_460.md) Having strewn Darbha grass,
to the south of the fire, in the place destined for the Brahman,

15. <span id="fr_461"></span>[15](#fn_461) Having with the two (verses.md),
'I take (the fire) to myself,' and, 'The fire which (has entered)'—taken
possession of the fire,

16. <span id="fr_462"></span>[16](#fn_462.md) And having, to the north of
the fire, spread out Darbha grass, he prepares the (following) objects,

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

according as they are required (for the ceremony which he is going to
perform):

17. <span id="fr_463"></span>[17](#fn_463) A stone, a (new.md) garment
which has not yet been washed, a skin (of an antelope, or a spotted
deer, &c.), a threefold-twisted girdle of Mu*ñg*a grass if he is a
Brâhma*n*a (who shall be initiated), a bowstring for a Râ*g*anya, a
woollen thread for a Vai*s*ya, a staff of Bilva or of Palâ*s*a wood for
a Brâhma*n*a, of Nyagrodha wood for a Râ*g*anya, of Udumbara wood for a
Vai*s*ya.

18. <span id="fr_464"></span>[18](#fn_464.md) He binds together the fuel,
twenty-one pieces of wood, or as many as there are oblations to be made.

19\. Together with that fuel he ties up the (three) branches of wood
which are to be laid round the fire, (which should have the shape of)
pegs.

20. <span id="fr_465"></span>[20](#fn_465.md) (He gets ready, besides, the
spoon called) Darvî, a bunch of grass, the Â*g*ya pot, the pot for the
Pra*n*îta water, and whatever (else) is required;

21\. All (those objects) together, or (one after the other) as it
happens.

22. <span id="fr_466"></span>[22](#fn_466.md) At that time the Brahman
suspends the sacrificial cord over his left shoulder, sips water, passes
by the fire, on its west side, to the south side, throws away a grass
blade from the Brahman's seat, touches water, and sits down with his
face turned towards the fire.

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

23. <span id="fr_467"></span>[23](#fn_467.md) He takes as 'purifiers' two
straight Darbha blades with unbroken points of one span's length, cuts
them off with something else than his nail, wipes them with water, pours
water into a vessel over which he has laid the purifiers, fills (that
vessel) up to near the brim, purifies (the water) three times with the
two Darbha strainers, holding their points to the north, places (the
water) on Darbha grass on the north side of the fire, and covers it with
Darbha grass.

24. <span id="fr_468"></span>[24](#fn_468.md) Having consecrated the
Proksha*n*î water by means of the purifiers as before, having placed the
vessels upright, and having untied the fuel, he sprinkles (the
sacrificial vessels) three times with the whole (Proksha*n*î water).

25. <span id="fr_469"></span>[25](#fn_469.md) Having warmed the Darvî spoon
(over the fire), having wiped it, and warmed it again, he puts it down.

26\. Having besprinkled (with water) the Darbha grass with which the
fuel was tied together, he throws it into the fire.

27. <span id="fr_470"></span>[27](#fn_470.md) He melts the Â*g*ya, pours
the Â*g*ya into the Â*g*ya pot over which he has laid the purifiers,
takes some coals (from the fire) towards the north, puts (the Â*g*ya) on
these (coals), throws light (on the

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Â*g*ya by means of
burning Darbha blades), throws two young Darbha shoots into it, moves a
fire-brand round it three times, takes it (from the coals) towards the
north, pushes the coals back (into the fire), purifies the Â*g*ya three
times with the two purifiers, holding their points towards the north,
(drawing them through the Â*g*ya from west to east and) taking them back
(to the west each time), throws the two purifiers into the fire,

<span id="fn_454"></span>[137:2](sbe30044.htm#fr_454.md) 1, 2. The
statement commonly given in the G*ri*hya-sûtras and Dharma-sûtras is,
that the initiation of a Brâhma*n*a shall take place in his eighth year,
though there are differences of opinion whether in the eighth year after
conception, or after birth (Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 19, 1. 2).
Mât*ri*datta states that the rule given here in the G*ri*hya-sûtra
refers to the seventh year after birth. In the Dharma-sûtra (comp.
Âpastamba I, 1, 18) it is stated that the initiation of a Brâhma*n*a
shall take place in the eighth year after his conception. Comp. the
remarks of Professor Bidder, S.B.E., vol. ii, p. xxiii.

Proksha*n*î water, see *S*âṅkhâyana I, 8, 25 note. The word which I have
translated by 'vessels' is bilavanti, which literally means 'the things
which have brims.' Probably this expression here has some technical
connotation unknown to me. Mât*ri*datta simply says, bilavanti
pâtrâ*n*i.—'As before' means, 'as stated with regard to the Pra*n*îta
water.'
