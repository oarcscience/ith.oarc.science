<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">We</span> begin our introductory remarks on the literature of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras with the attempt to collect the more important data which throw light on the development of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual during the oldest period of Hindu antiquity.</p>  
<p>There are, as it seems, no direct traces of the G<I>ri</I>hya ceremonies in the most ancient portion of Vedic literature. It is certain indeed that a number of the most important of those ceremonies are contemporaneous with or even earlier than the most ancient hymns of the <I>Ri</I>g-veda, as far as their fundamental elements and character are concerned, whatever their precise arrangement may have been. However, in the literature of the oldest period they play no part. It was another portion of the ritual that attracted the attention of the poets to whom we owe the hymns to Agni, Indra, and the other deities of the Vedic Olympus, viz. the offerings of the <I>S</I>rauta-Ritual with their far superior pomp, or, to state the matter more precisely, among the offerings of the <I>S</I>rauta-Ritual the Soma offering. In the Soma offering centred the thought, the poetry, and we may almost say the life of the Vasish<I>th</I>as, of the Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;mitras, &amp;c., in whose families the poetry of the <I>Ri</I>g-veda had its home. We may assume that the acts of the G<I>ri</I>hya worship, being more limited in extent and simpler in their ritual construction than the great Soma offerings, were not yet at that time, so far as they existed at all, decked out with the reciting of the poetic texts, which we find later on connected with them, and which in the case of the Soma offering came early to be used. Probably they were celebrated in simple unadorned fashion;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_x"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. x</FONT></A></p>  
<p>what the person making the offering had to say was doubtless limited to short, possibly prose formulas, so that these ceremonies remained free from the poetry of the above-mentioned families of priests&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. We think that the character of the verses given in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, which had to be repeated at the performance of the different ceremonies, justifies us in making these conjectures. Some of these verses indeed are old Vedic verses, but we have no proof that they were composed for the purposes of the G<I>ri</I>hya ceremonies, and the connection in which we find them in the <I>Ri</I>g-veda proves rather the contrary. Another portion of these verses and songs proves to have been composed indeed for the very G<I>ri</I>hya ceremonies for which they are prescribed in the texts of the ritual: but these verses are more recent than the old parts of the <I>Ri</I>g-veda. Part of them are found in the <I>Ri</I>g-veda in a position which speaks for their more recent origin, others are not contained in the <I>Ri</I>g-veda at all. Many of these verses are found in the more recent Vedic Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s, especially in the Atharva-veda Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; which may be regarded in the main as a treasure of G<I>ri</I>hya verses; others finally have not as yet been traced to any Vedic Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, and we know them from the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras only. We may infer that, during the latter part of the <I>Ri</I>g-veda period, ceremonies such as marriage and burial began to be decked out with poetry as had long been the case with the Soma offering. The principal collection of marriage sentences&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1"></A><A HREF="#fn_1"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and the sentences for the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>burial of the dead&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_2"></A><A HREF="#fn_2"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are found in the tenth Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala of the <I>Ri</I>g-veda, which, for the most part, is known to be of later origin than the preceding portions of the collections&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. If we look into the character of the verses, which these long G<I>ri</I>hya songs are composed of, we shall find additional grounds for assuming their early origin. A few remarks about their metrical character will make this clear&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. There is no other metre in which the contrast between the early and later periods of Vedic literature manifests itself so clearly as in the Anush<I>t</I>ubh-metre&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The Anush<I>t</I>ubh hemistich consists of sixteen syllables, which are divided by the caesura into two halves of eight syllables each. The second of these halves has as a rule the iambic ending (<A NAME="img__01100"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/_01100.jpg">), though this rule was not so strictly carried out in the early as in the later period&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. The iambic ending is also the rule in the older parts of the Veda for the close of the first half, i.e. for the four syllables before the caesura&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. We know that the later prosody, as we see it in certain late parts of Vedic literature, in the P&acirc;li Pi<I>t</I>akas of the Buddhists, and later in the great epic poems, not only departs from the usage of the older period, but adopts a directly contrary course, i.e. the iambic ending of the first p&acirc;da, which was formerly the rule, is not allowed at all later, and instead of it the prevailing ending is the antispast (<A NAME="img__01101"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/_01101.jpg">) It goes without saying that such a change in metrical usage, as the one just described, cannot have</p>

<p>taken place at one jump. And accordingly a consideration of the Vedic texts reveals a transition period or rather a series of several transition periods between the old and the new standpoints. The first change is that every other ending of the first p&acirc;da is allowed by the side of the iambic ending. The two forms of the ending, the one prevailing in the earliest, and the one prevailing in the later period of the prosody, the iambic (<A NAME="img__01200"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/_01200.jpg">) and the antispastic (<A NAME="img__01201"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/_01201.jpg">), are those that occur most frequently in the intermediate period, but besides them all other possible forms are allowed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>This is precisely the stage of metrical development which the great G<I>ri</I>hya songs of the tenth Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala of the <I>Ri</I>g-veda have reached. Let us consider, for instance, the marriage songs and the marriage sayings, X, 85, and see what kind of ending there is at the end of the first p&acirc;da. Of the first seventeen verses of this S&ucirc;kta sixteen are in Anush<I>t</I>ubh metre (verse 14 is Trish<I>t</I>ubh); we have therefore thirty-two cases in which the metrical form of these syllables must be investigated. The quantity of the syllable immediately preceding the caesura being a matter of indifference, we have not sixteen but only eight a priori possible combinations for the form of the last four syllables of the p&acirc;da; I give each of these forms below, adding each time in how many of the thirty-two cases it is used:</p>  <div align="center">  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

<p>We see that all the possible combinations are actually represented in these thirty-two cases, and accordingly the metrical build of this S&ucirc;kta shows that it belongs to a period to which only the latest songs of the <I>Ri</I>g-veda collection can be referred, but the peculiarities of which may be often noticed in the Atharva-veda and in the verses scattered throughout the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a literature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>A hasty glance suffices to show that those verses of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual which do not appear in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s, but which are quoted at full length in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, are also in the same stage. For instance, the seven Anush<I>t</I>ubh verses which are quoted <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya I, 19, 5. 6, give us the following relations, if we investigate them as we did those in <I>Ri</I>g-veda X, 85:</p>  <div align="center">  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

<p>Thus even the small number of fourteen hemistichs is enough to give us seven of the eight existing combinations, and no single one occurs at all often enough to allow us to call it predominant.</p>  
<p>Or we may take the saying that accompanies the performance of the medh&acirc;<I>g</I>anana on the new-born child. In the version of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> we have:</p>

<p>Or the saying with which the pupil (brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin) has to lay a log of wood on the fire of the teacher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:</p>

<p>There would be no object in multiplying the number of examples; those here given are sufficient to prove our proposition, that the development of the G<I>ri</I>hya rites in the form in which they are described to us in the S&ucirc;tras, that especially their being accompanied with verses, which were to be recited by their performance, is later than the time of the oldest Vedic poetry, and coincides rather with the transition period in the development of the Anush<I>t</I>ubh metre, a period which lies between the old Vedic and the later Buddhistic and epic form.</p>  
<p>Besides the formulae intended to be recited during the performance of the various sacred acts, the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras contain a second kind of verses, which differ essentially from the first kind in regard to metre; viz. verses of ritualistic character, which are inserted here and there between the prose S&ucirc;tras, and of which the subject-matter is similar to that of the surrounding prose. We shall have to consider these ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>ag&acirc;th&acirc;s, as they are occasionally called, later; at present let us go on looking for traces of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual and for the origin of G<I>ri</I>hya literature in the literature which precedes the S&ucirc;tras.</p>  
<p>The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts, which, as a whole, have for their subject-matter the Vait&acirc;nika ceremonies celebrated with the three holy fires, furnish evidence that the G<I>ri</I>hya fire, together with the holy acts accomplished in connection with it, were also already known. The Aitareya-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> gives this</p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>fire the most usual name, the same name which is used for it in the S&ucirc;tras, g<I>ri</I>hya agni, and describes a ceremony to be performed over this fire with expressions which agree exactly with the style of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. We often find in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts also mention of the terminus technicus, which the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras use many times as a comprehensive term for the offerings connected with G<I>ri</I>hya ritual, the word p&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. For instance, the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, in order to designate the whole body of offerings, uses the expression: all offerings, those that are P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as and the others. It is especially common to find the P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as mentioned in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts in connection with the myth of Manu. The Taittir&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> opposes the whole body of sacrifices to the P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as. The former belonged to the gods, who through it attained to the heavenly world; the latter concerned Manu: thus the goddess I<I>d</I>&acirc; turned to him. Similar remarks, bringing Manu or the goddess I<I>d</I>&acirc; into relation with the P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as, are to be found Taittir&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; VI, 2, 5, 4; Aitareya-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a III, 40, 2. However, in this case as in many others, the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a contains the most detailed data, from which we see how the idea of Manu as the performer of P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as is connected with the history of the great deluge, out of which Manu alone was left. We read in the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>:</p>  
<p>

<p>'Now the flood had carried away all these creatures, and thus Manu was left there alone. Then Manu went about singing praises and toiling, wishing for offspring. And he sacrificed there also with a P&acirc;ka-sacrifice. He poured clarified butter, thickened milk, whey, and curds in the water as a libation.' It is then told how the goddess I<I>d</I>&acirc; arose out of this offering. I presume that the story of the P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a as the first offering made by Manu after the great flood, stands in a certain correlation to the idea of the introduction of the three sacrificial fires through Pur&ucirc;ravas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Pur&ucirc;ravas is the son of I<I>d</I>&acirc;; the original man Manu, who brings forth I<I>d</I>&acirc; through his offering, cannot have made use of a form of offering which presupposes the existence of I<I>d</I>&acirc;, and which moreover is based on the triad of the sacred fires introduced by Pur&ucirc;ravas; hence Manu's offering must have been a P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a; we read in one of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: 'All P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as are performed without I<I>d</I>&acirc;.'</p>  
<p>There are still other passages in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts showing that the G<I>ri</I>hya offerings were already known; I will mention a saying of Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya's reported in the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: he would not allow that the daily morning and evening offering was a common offering, but said that, in a certain measure, it was a P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a. Finally I would call attention to the offering prescribed in the last book of the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> for the man 'who wishes that a learned son should be born to him;' it is there stated that the preparation of the &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya (clarified butter) should be performed 'according to the rule of the Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka (pot-boiling),' and the way in which the offering is to</p>

<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>be performed is described by means of an expression, upagh&acirc;tam&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which often occurs in the G<I>ri</I>hya literature in a technical sense.</p>  
<p>We thus see that the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a books are acquainted with the G<I>ri</I>hya fire, and know about the G<I>ri</I>hya offerings and their permanent technical peculiarities; and it is not merely the later portions of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a works such as the fourteenth book of the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, in which we meet with evidence of this kind; we find it also in portions against the antiquity of which no objections can be raised.</p>  
<p>While therefore on the one hand the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts prove the existence of the G<I>ri</I>hya ceremonial, we see on the other hand, and first of all by means of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts themselves, that a literary treatment of this ritualistic subject-matter, as we find it in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as themselves with regard to the <I>S</I>rauta offerings, cannot then have existed. If there had existed texts, similar to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts preserved to us, which treated of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual, then, even supposing the texts themselves had disappeared, we should still necessarily find traces of them in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and S&ucirc;tras. He who will take the trouble to collect in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts the scattered references to the then existing literature, will be astonished at the great mass of notices of this kind that are preserved: but nowhere do we find traces of G<I>ri</I>hya Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as. And besides, if such works had ever existed, we should be at a loss to understand the difference which the Hindus make between the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras based on <I>S</I>ruti (revelation), and the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras resting on Sm<I>ri</I>ti (tradition) alone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The sacred G<I>ri</I>hya acts are regarded as 'sm&acirc;rta,' and when the question is raised with what right they can be considered as a duty resting on the sacrificer alongside of the <I>S</I>rauta acts, the answer is given that they too are based on a <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; of the Veda, but that this <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xviii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xviii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>hidden, so that its existence can only be demonstrated by reasoning&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>But the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts furnish us still in another way the most decisive arguments to prove that there have been no expositions of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual in Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a form: they contain exceptionally and scattered through their mass sections, in which they treat of subjects which according to later custom would have been treated in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras. Precisely this sporadic appearance of G<I>ri</I>hya chapters in the midst of expositions of a totally different contents leads us to draw the conclusion that literary compositions did not then exist, in which these chapters would have occupied their proper place as integral parts of a whole. Discussions of questions of G<I>ri</I>hya ritual are found in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a literature, naturally enough in those appendices of various kinds which generally follow the exposition of the principal subject of the <I>S</I>rauta ritual. Accordingly we find in the eleventh book of the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, among the manifold additions to subjects previously treated, which make up the principal contents of this book&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, an exposition of the Upanayana, i.e. the solemn reception of the pupil by the teacher, who is to teach him the Veda. The way in which the chapter on the Upanayana is joined to the preceding one, is eminently characteristic; it shows that it is the merest accident which has brought about in that place the discussion of a subject connected with the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual, and that a ceremony such as the Upanayana is properly not in its proper place in the midst of the literature of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts. A dialogue (brahmodya) between Udd&acirc;laka and <I>S</I>au<I>k</I>eya precedes; the two talk of the Agnihotra and of various expiations (pr&acirc;ya<I>s</I><I>k</I>itta) connected with that sacrifice. At the end <I>S</I>au<I>k</I>eya, filled with astonishment at the wisdom of Udd&acirc;laka, declares that he wishes to come to him as a pupil (up&acirc;y&acirc;ni bhagavantam), and Udd&acirc;laka</p>

<p>accepts him as his pupil. It is the telling of this story and the decisive words up&acirc;y&acirc;ni and upaninye which furnish the occasion for introducing the following section on the Upanayana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The subject is there treated in the peculiar style of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts, a style which we need not characterize here. I shall only mention one point, viz. that into the description and explanation of the Upanayana ceremony has been inserted one of those <I>S</I>lokas, such as we often find in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras also, as a sort of ornamental amplification of the prose exposition&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

<p>Another G<I>ri</I>hya section in the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a seems to have found its place there through a similar accidental kind of joining on to a preceding chapter as the above-mentioned passage. In XI, 5, 5 a story of the battle of the gods and Asuras is told: the gods beat the Asuras back by means of constantly larger Sattra celebrations and conquer for themselves the world of heaven. It seems to me that the description of the great Sattras celebrated by the gods is the occasion of the joining on of a section beginning with the words&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: 'There are five great sacrifices (mah&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as); they are great Sattras: the offering to Beings, the offering to men, the offering to the Fathers (i.e. the Manes), the offering to the Gods, the offering to the Brahman.' After this introduction follows an account of one of the five great offerings, namely of the Brahmaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, i.e. of the daily Veda recitation (sv&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya). The third Adhy&acirc;ya of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana's G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra begins in exactly the same way with the sentence: 'Now (follow) the five sacrifices: the sacrifice to the Gods, the sacrifice to the Beings, the sacrifice to the Fathers, the sacrifice to the Brahman, the sacrifice to men,' and then follows here also a discussion of the Brahmaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, which is entirely analogous to that given in the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana here does not content himself with describing the actual course of ceremonies as is the rule in the S&ucirc;tra texts; he undertakes, quite in the way of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts, to explain their meaning: 'In that he recites the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>as, he thereby satiates the gods with oblations of milk, in that (he recites) the Ya<I>g</I>us, with oblations of ghee,' &amp;c. It is plain that the mode of exposition adopted by &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana in this passage, which is different from the usual S&ucirc;tra style, finds its explanation in the supposition that exceptionally in this case the author of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra had before him a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a text, which he could take as his model, whether that text was the <I>S</I>atapatha itself or another similar text.</p>  
<p>Among the extremely various prescriptions which we find</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in the last sections of the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, there is a rather long section, which also really belongs to the G<I>ri</I>hya domain. To quote from this section&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: 'If a man wishes that a learned son should be born to him, famous, a public man, a popular speaker, that he should know all the Vedas, and that he should live to his full age, then, after having prepared boiled rice with meat and butter, they should both eat, being fit to have offspring,' &amp;c. Then follows a description of an &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya offering, after which the marital cohabitation is to be performed with certain formulas. This, however, is not the last of the acts through which the father assures himself of the possession of such a distinguished son; certain rites follow, which are to be performed at birth and after birth, the &Acirc;yushya ceremony and the Medh&acirc;<I>g</I>anana. These rites are here prescribed for the special case where the father has the above-mentioned wishes for the prosperity of his child; but the description agrees essentially with the description of the corresponding acts in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, which are inculcated for all cases, without reference to a determined wish of the father. It is a justifiable conjecture that, although this certainly does not apply to the whole of ceremonies described in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, many portions of these ceremonies and verses that were used in connection with them, &amp;c., were first developed, not as a universal rite or duty, but as the special possession of individuals, who hoped to attain special goods and advantages by performing the ceremony in this way.</p>  
<p>It was only later, as I think, that such prescriptions</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>assumed the character of universality, with which we find them propounded in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras.</p>  
<p>It is scarcely necessary to go through the sections of the texts of other Vedic schools referring to the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual in the same way in which we have done it in the case of the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. The data which we have produced from the great Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of the white Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, will be sufficient for our purpose, which is to give an idea of the stage in which the literary treatment of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual stood during the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a period. As we see, there were then properly no G<I>ri</I>hya texts; but many of the elements which we find later in the G<I>ri</I>hya texts were either already formed or were in the process of formation. Most of the verses which are used for the G<I>ri</I>hya acts&#151;in so far as they are not verses composed in the oldest period for the Soma offering and transferred to the G<I>ri</I>hya ceremonies&#151;bear the formal imprint of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a period; the domestic sacrificial fire and the ritual peculiarities of the P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as which were to be performed at it, were known; descriptions of some such P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as were given in prose; there were also already <I>S</I>lokas which gave in metrical form explanations about certain points of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual, just as we find in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts analogous <I>S</I>lokas referring to subjects connected with the <I>S</I>rauta ritual.</p>  
<p>Thus was the next step which the literary development took in the S&ucirc;tra period prepared and rendered easy. The more systematic character which the exposition of the ritualistic discipline assumed in this period, necessarily led to the taking of this step: the domain of the G<I>ri</I>hya sacrifices was recognised and expounded as a second great principal part of the ritual of sacrifices alongside of the <I>S</I>rauta domain which was alone attended to in the earlier period. The G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras arose which treat, according to the expression of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana in his first sentence, of the g<I>ri</I>hy&acirc;<I>n</I>i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as distinguished from the vait&acirc;nik&acirc;ni, or, as <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana says, of the p&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;s, or, as P&acirc;raskara says, of the g<I>ri</I>hyasth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;k&acirc;n&acirc;<I>m</I> karma. The</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxiii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxiii</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras treat their subject of course in exactly the same style in which the sacrifices of the <I>S</I>rauta ritual had been treated by the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras, which they constantly assume to be known and which are the works of teachers of the same Vedic schools, and oftentimes even perhaps the works of the same authors. Only certain differences in the character of the two groups of texts are naturally conditioned on the one hand by the greater complexity of the <I>S</I>rauta sacrifices and the comparative simplicity of the G<I>ri</I>hya sacrifices, on the other hand by the fact that the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras are entirely based on Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a texts, in which the same subjects were treated, while the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, as we have seen, possessed such a foundation only for a very small portion of their contents.</p>  
<p>It goes without saying that the above-mentioned statement that the subjects treated of in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras are P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or G<I>ri</I>hyasth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;kas should not be pressed with the utmost strictness, as though nothing were treated in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras which does not come under these heads. First of all the term Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka is too narrow, since it does not include the offerings of sacrificial butter which constituted a great number of ceremonies. But besides many ceremonies and observances are taught in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, which cannot in any way be characterised as sacrifices at all, only possessing some inner resemblance to the group of sacrifices there treated of, or standing in more or less close connection with them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The S&ucirc;tra texts divide the P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as in various ways; either four or seven principal forms are taken up. The</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxiv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>commonest division is that into the four classes of the hutas, ahutas, prahutas, pr&acirc;<I>s</I>itas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The division into seven classes is doubtless occasioned by the division of the Havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as and of the Somaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as, which also each include seven classes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; for the nature of the sacrifices in question would hardly of itself have led to such a division. The seven classes taken up are either those given by Gautama VIII, 15&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: 'The seven kinds of P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as, viz. the Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc;, the P&acirc;rva<I>n</I>a (Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka, offered on the new and full moon days), the funeral oblations, the <I>S</I>r&acirc;va<I>n</I>&icirc;, the &Acirc;grah&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;, the <I>K</I>aitr&icirc;, and the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vayu<I>g</I>&icirc;.' Or else the seven classes are established as follows, the fourfold division being utilised to some extent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>: 'Huta, Prahuta, &Acirc;huta (sic, not Ahuta), the spit-ox sacrifice, the Bali offering, the re-descent (on the &Acirc;grah&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a day), the Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc; sacrifice.' According to the account of Prof. B&uuml;hler&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, the exposition of Baudh&acirc;yana, who gives this division, keeps closely to the course which it prescribes. For the rest, however, the G<I>ri</I>hya texts with which I am acquainted do not follow any of these divisions, and this is easily accounted for, if we consider the artificial character of these classifications, which are undertaken merely for the sake of having a complete scheme of the sacrifices. On the contrary, as a whole the texts give an arrangement which is based on the nature of the ceremonies they describe. In many instances we find considerable variations between the texts of the different schools; often enough, in a given text, the place</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>which is assigned to a given chapter is not to be explained without assuming a certain arbitrariness on tlfe part of the author. But, as a whole, we cannot fail to recognise in the arrangement of the different texts a certain agreement, which we will here merely try to explain in its main traits; the points of detail, which would complete what we here say, will occur of themselves to any one who looks at the texts themselves.</p>  
<p>The domestic life of the Hindus represents, so to speak, a circle, in which it is in a certain measure indifferent what point is selected as the starting-point. Two especially important epochs in this life are: on the one hand, the period of studentship of the young Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin devoted to the study of the Veda; at the beginning of this period comes the ceremony of the Upanayana, at the end that of the Sam&acirc;vartana; on the other hand, marriage (viv&acirc;ha), which besides has a special importance for the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual, from the circumstance, that as a rule the cultus of the domestic sacrificial fire begins with marriage. One can just as well imagine an exposition of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual, which proceeds from the description of the studentship to that of the marriage, as one which proceeds from the description of the marriage to that of the studentship. The Sam&acirc;vartana, which designates the end of the period of studentship, gives the Hindu the right and the duty to found a household&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. On the other hand, if the exposition begins with the marriage, there follows naturally the series of ceremonies which are to be performed up to the birth of a child, and then the ceremonies for the young child, which finally lead up to the Upanayana and a description of the period of studentship. The Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>i-s&ucirc;tra alone, of the S&ucirc;tras treated of in these translations, follows the first of the two orders mentioned&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_46"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; the other texts follow the other order,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>which has been already described by Prof. Max M&uuml;ller almost thirty years ago, and we cannot do better than to give his description&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_47"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: 'Then (i.e. after the marriage) follow the Sa<I>m</I>sk&acirc;ras, the rites to be performed at the conception of a child, at various periods before his birth, at the time of his birth, the ceremony of naming the child, of carrying him out to see the sun, of feeding him, of cutting his hair, and lastly of investing him as a student, and handing him to a Guru, under whose care he is to study the sacred writings, that is to say, to learn them by heart, and 'to perform all the offices of a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin, or religious student.'</p>  
<p>In this way we find, as a rule, in the foreground in the first part of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras this great group of acts which accompany the domestic life from marriage to the studentship and the Sam&acirc;vartana of the child sprung from wedlock. We find, however, inserted into the description of these ceremonies, in various ways in the different S&ucirc;tras, the exposition of a few ritualistic matters which we have not yet mentioned. In the first place a description of the setting up of the sacred domestic fire, i.e. of the ceremony which in the domain of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual corresponds to the agny&acirc;dheya of the <I>S</I>rauta ritual. The setting up of the fire forms the necessary preliminary to all sacred acts; the regular time for it is the wedding&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, so that the fire used for the wedding acts accompanies the young couple to their home, and there forms the centre of their household worship. Accordingly in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras the description of the setting up of the fire stands, as a rule, at the beginning of the whole, not far from the description of the wedding.</p>  
<p>Next the introductory sections of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras have to describe the type of the G<I>ri</I>hya sacrifice, which is universally available and recurs at all household ceremonies. This can be done in such a way that this type is described for itself, without direct reference to a particular sacrifice. This is the case in P&acirc;raskara, who in the first chapter of his</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> S&ucirc;tra describes the rites recurring at each sacrifice, and then remarks: 'This ritual holds good, whenever a sacrifice is offered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' Similarly &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana, in one of the first chapters of his work, enumerates the rites which are to be performed 'whenever he intends to sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_50"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' Other texts give a general description of the G<I>ri</I>hya sacrifice by exemplifying it by one special sacrifice. <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_51"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> chooses for this the sacrifice which the bridegroom has to offer, when a favourable answer has been granted to his wooing; Gobhila&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_52"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> gives at least the greater part of the rules in question &agrave; propos of the full moon and of the new moon sacrifice; Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_53"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, who opens his account at the period of the studentship of the young Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, describes the sacrificial type &agrave; propos of the Upanayana rite.</p>  
<p>The sacrifices which are to be offered daily at morning and at evening, those which are celebrated monthly on the days of the new moon and of the full moon&#151;the G<I>ri</I>hya copies of the Agnihotra and of the Dar<I>s</I>ap&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa sacrifices&#151;and, thirdly, the daily distribution of the Bali offerings: these ceremonies are commonly described along with what we have called the first great group of the G<I>ri</I>hya acts, immediately preceding or following the Viv&acirc;ha.</p>  
<p>We find, as a second group of sacred acts, a series of celebrations, which, if the man has founded his household, are to be performed regularly at certain times of the year at the household fire. So the <I>S</I>rav&acirc;<I>n</I>a sacrifice, which is offered to the snakes at the time when, on account of the danger from snakes, a raised couch is necessary at night. At the end of this period the festival of the re-descent is celebrated: the exchanging of the high couch for the low couch on the ground. Between these two festivals comes the P<I>ri</I>sh&acirc;taka offering on the full-moon day of the month &Acirc;<I>s</I>vayu<I>g</I>a; it receives in the G<I>ri</I>hya texts the place corresponding to that which actually belongs to</p>

<p>it in the series of the festivals. As a rule&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the acts we have just mentioned are followed, in accordance with the natural series, by the Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc; festivals, which are celebrated during the last months of the year.</p>  
<p>Alongside of these acts which are connected with fixed points of the year we find in the various G<I>ri</I>hya texts an account of a series of other ceremonies, which, in accordance with their nature, have no such fixed position in the system of the ritual. Thus, for instance, the rites which refer to the choice of a piece of ground to build a house or to the building itself; further, the rites connected with agriculture and cattle raising. In many texts we find together with this group of acts also an account of the ceremonies, related to fixed points in the year, which stand in connection with the annual course of Vedic study: the description of the opening festival and of the closing festival of the school term, as well as a point which generally follows these descriptions, the rules as to the anadhy&acirc;ya, i.e. as to the occasions which necessitate an intermission in the study of the Veda for a longer or for a shorter period. As a rule, the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras bring the account of these things into the group of acts which refer to the household life of the G<I>ri</I>hastha; for the Adhy&acirc;pana, i.e. the teaching of the Veda, held the first place among the rights and duties of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who had completed his time at school. On the other hand these ceremonies can naturally also be considered as connected with the school life of the young Hindu, and accordingly they are placed in that division by Gobhila&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, between the description of the Upanayana and that of the Sam&acirc;vartana.</p>  
<p>The sacred acts connected with the burial and the worship of the dead (the various kinds of <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha rites) may be designated as a third group of the ceremonies which are described to us in the G<I>ri</I>hya.-s&ucirc;tras. Finally, a fourth group comprises the acts which are connected with the attainment of particular desires (k&acirc;my&acirc;ni). Among the</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxix"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxix</FONT></A></p>  
<p>texts here translated we find a somewhat detailed account of these ceremonies in the Gobhila-s&ucirc;tra and in the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya only&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>These remarks cannot claim to give a complete outline of the contents and arrangement of the G<I>ri</I>hya texts; they only aim at giving an idea of the fundamental traits, which in each particular text are modified by manifold variations, but which nevertheless are to these variations as the rule is to the exceptions.</p>  
<p>We must now speak of the relations of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras to the two other kinds of S&ucirc;tra texts, with which they have so many points of contact in the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras and the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras.</p>  
<p>Prof. B&uuml;hler, in several places of the excellent introductions which he has prefixed to his translations of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras, has called attention to the fact that the relation in which the S&ucirc;tra texts of the same school stand to each other is very different in different schools. Many schools possess a great corpus of S&ucirc;tras, the parts of which are the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, &amp;c. This is, for instance, the case with the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; its S&ucirc;tra is divided into thirty Pra<I>s</I>nas, the contents of which are divided as follows:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I-XXIV: <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra.</p>  
<p>XXV: Paribh&acirc;sh&acirc;s, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>XXVI: Mantras for the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra.</p>  
<p>XXVII: G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra.</p>  
<p>XXVIII-XXIX: Dharma-s&ucirc;tra.</p>  
<p>XXX: <I>S</I>ulva-s&ucirc;tra.</div></p>  
<p>In other cases the single S&ucirc;tra texts stand more independently side by side; they are not considered as parts of one and the same great work, but as different works. Of course it is the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras above all which could be freed from the connection with the other S&ucirc;tra texts to such an extent, that even their belonging to a distinct Vedic school may be doubtful. The contents</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xxx"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxx</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of this class of S&ucirc;tras indeed have hardly any connection with the subdivisions and differences of the Vedic texts handed down in the various schools; there was no reason why Brahmans, who studied various <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s of the Veda, should not learn the ordinances concerning law and morals given in these S&ucirc;tras as they were formulated in the same texts. The G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras are not so independent of the differences of the Vedic schools. The close analogy between the sacrificial ritual of the G<I>ri</I>hya acts and that of the <I>S</I>rauta acts, and the consequent necessity of taking into account the <I>S</I>rauta ritual in the exposition of the G<I>ri</I>hya ritual, necessarily brought the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras into closer connection with and into greater dependence on the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras than in the case of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But above all, the G<I>ri</I>hya ceremonies demanded the knowledge of numerous Mantras, and accordingly as these Mantras were borrowed from the one or the ether Mantra <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_59"></A><A HREF="#fn_59"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, there followed in the case of the G<I>ri</I>hya text in question an intimate connection with the corresponding Mantra school&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_60"></A><A HREF="#fn_60"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. We find accordingly as a general rule, that each G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra presupposes a Vedic Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, whose Mantras it quotes only in their Prat&icirc;kas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_61"></A><A HREF="#fn_61"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, and that besides each G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra presupposes a previous</p>

<p>knowledge of the ritual which is acquired through the study of the proper <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_62"></A><A HREF="#fn_62"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is not necessary to quote the numerous places where the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras either expressly refer to the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras, or point to them by repeating the same phrases or often even whole S&ucirc;tras. It will be sufficient to quote one out of many places, the opening words of the &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya, which in a way characterise this work as a second part of the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra: 'The rites based on the spreading (of the three sacred fires) have been declared; we shall declare the G<I>ri</I>hya rites&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_63"></A><A HREF="#fn_63"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>Thus it is not difficult to perceive the dependence of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras on the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras; but there remains the much more difficult question whether in each particular case both texts are to be regarded as by the same author, or whether the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra is an appendix to the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra composed by another author. Tradition accepts the one alternative for some S&ucirc;tras; for other S&ucirc;tras it accepts the other; thus in the domain of the Rig-Veda literature &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana and <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana are credited with the authorship of a <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra as well as of a G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra; the same is true of &Acirc;pastamba, Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in, and other authors. On the other hand, the authorship of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras which follow the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras of K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana, L&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yana, Dr&acirc;hy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, is not ascribed to K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana, L&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yana, Dr&acirc;hy&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, but to P&acirc;raskara, Gobhila, and Kh&acirc;dir&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya.</p>  
<p>It seems to me that we should consider the testimony of tradition as entirely trustworthy in the second class of cases. Tradition is very much inclined to ascribe to celebrated masters and heads of schools the origin of works which are acknowledged authorities in their schools, even though they are not the authors. But it is not likely that tradition should have made a mistake in the opposite</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>direction, that e.g. it should designate P&acirc;raskara as author when K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana himself was the author.</p>  
<p>We shall not be able to trust so implicitly to tradition where it puts down the same author for the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra as for the corresponding <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra; the possibility that such data are false is so large that we have to treat them as doubtful so long as we have not discovered certain proofs of their correctness. At present, so far as I can see, we are just as little justified in considering that such a proof has been made as we are able to prove the opposite state of things. It is easy to find the many agreements in contents and expression which exist, for instance, between the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra and G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana, or between the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra and the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra of &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_64"></A><A HREF="#fn_64"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But these agreements cannot be considered as sufficient proof that in each case the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra and the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra are by the same author. Even if the author of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra was not &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana or <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana in person, still he must have been at all events perfectly familiar with the works of those teachers, and must have intended to fit his work to theirs as closely as possible, so that agreements of this kind can in no way astonish us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_65"></A><A HREF="#fn_65"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. On the other hand, if the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras and G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras are read together, it is easy to discover small irregularities in the exposition, repetitions and such like, which might seem to indicate different authors. But the irregularities of this kind which have been detected up to the present are scarcely of such</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xxxiii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxiii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>a character as not to be easily ascribable to mistakes and carelessness such as even a careful author may be guilty of in the course of a large work&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_66"></A><A HREF="#fn_66"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It seems to me then that until the discovery of further circumstances throwing light on the question of the identity of the authors of the <I>S</I>rautas and of the G<I>ri</I>hyas, it would be premature if we were to venture on a decision of this question in one direction or the other.</p>  
<p>Prof. B&uuml;hler's investigations have made perfectly clear the relation in which the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras and the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras stand to each other in those cases, where we have texts of both kinds by the same school. In the case of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra and the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas he has proved&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_67"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that both texts were the work of the same author according to a common plan, so that the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra is as short and terse as possible, because &Acirc;pastamba had reserved for the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra a portion of the subject-matter generally treated of in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras. Besides there are references in each of the two texts to the other which strengthen the proof of their being written by the same author. In the S&ucirc;tra collection of Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in the state of things is different. Here, as Prof. B&uuml;hler has also shown&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_68"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, we find numerous discrepancies between the G<I>ri</I>hya and the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, which are owing to the fact, that while this teacher took as Dharma-s&ucirc;tra that of &Acirc;pastamba with some unessential changes, he composed a G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra of his own. Of the two S&ucirc;tras of Baudh&acirc;yana, the same distinguished scholar, to whom we owe the remarks we have just mentioned, has treated in the Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiv, p. xxxi.</p>  
<p>I believe that every reader who compares the two kinds of texts will notice that the frame within which the exposition of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras is inclosed, is an essentially</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xxxiv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxiv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>broader one than in the case of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras. We have here, I think, the same phenomenon that may also be observed, for instance, in the domain of the Buddhist Vinaya literature, where the exposition of the life of the community was at first given only in connection with the explanation of the list of sins (P&acirc;timokkha) which was promulgated every half month at the meetings of the spiritual brethren. It was not till later that a more comprehensive exposition, touching all the sides of the life of the community was attempted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_69"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, an exposition which, on the one hand, no longer limited itself to the points discussed in the P&acirc;timokkha, and which, on the other hand, necessarily had much in common with what was laid down in the P&acirc;timokkha. The relation of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras and Dharma-s&ucirc;tras seems to me to be of a similar nature. The G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras begin to treat of the events of the daily life of the household, but they do not yet undertake to exhaust the great mass of this subject-matter; on the contrary they confine themselves principally to the ritual or sacrificial side of household life, as is natural owing to their connection with the older ritualistic literature. Then the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras take an important step further; their purpose is to describe the whole of the rights and customs which prevail in private, civic, and public life. They naturally among other things touch upon the ceremonies treated in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, but they generally merely mention them and discuss the questions of law and custom which are connected with them, without undertaking to go into the technical ordinances as to the way in which these ceremonies are to be performed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_70"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Only in a few cases do portions treated of in the domain of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras happen to coincide with portions treated of in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras. Thus especially, apart from a few objects of less importance, the detailed rules for the behaviour of the Sn&acirc;taka and the rules for the interruptions</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxxv"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxv</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the Veda study (anadhy&acirc;ya) are generally treated in an exactly similar way in the texts of the one and those of the other category.</p>  
<p align="center">___________________</p>  
<p>We have spoken above of the metrical peculiarities of the Mantras quoted in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, the metre of which clearly proves what is indubitable from other reasons, that most, if not all, of these verses were composed at a perceptibly older period than the descriptions of the sacred acts in the midst of which they are inserted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_71"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. A second kind of verses which are quoted in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras must be carefully distinguished from these. It is doubtful whether there are any to be found among them which the authors of the S&ucirc;tras have themselves composed; but they were composed at a period decidedly more recent than those Mantras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and they therefore exhibit metrical peculiarities which are essentially different. The verses I mean are <I>S</I>lokas of ritual contents, which are quoted to confirm or to complete what is stated in the prose, and which are introduced by such expressions as tad apy &acirc;hu<I>h</I> 'here they say also,' or tad api <I>s</I>lok&acirc;<I>h</I> 'here there are also <I>S</I>lokas,' and other similar phrases&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>We called attention above (<A HREF="#page_xix">p. xix</A>) to the fact that a verse of this kind occurs in one of the G<I>ri</I>hya chapters of the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, in a metre corresponding to the peculiarities of the older literary style. On the other hand, the verses appearing in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras differ only in a few cases from the standard of the later <I>S</I>loka prosody, as we have it, e. g. in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata and in the laws of Manu. In the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;nd. Gesellschaft, vol. xxxvii, p. 67, I have given tables for the verses in question out of the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya, and these tables show that the characteristic ending of the first</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> <I>S</I>loka P&acirc;da for the later period <A NAME="img__03600"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/_03600.jpg">, which, for instance, in the Nalop&acirc;khy&acirc;na of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata covers precisely five-sixths of all the cases, occurs in <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana in thirty cases out of thirty-nine, that is in about three quarters of the cases&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana has still twice the ending <A NAME="img__03601"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/_03601.jpg"> which is the rule in the <I>Ri</I>g-veda, but which is forbidden by the later prosody: prahuta<I>h</I> pit<I>ri</I>karma<I>n</I>&acirc;, uktv&acirc; mantra<I>m</I> sp<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ed apa<I>h</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. It may be observed that a similar treatment of the <I>S</I>loka metre appears also in the <I>Ri</I>g-veda Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya of <I>S</I>aunaka. Here too the modern form of the ending of the first p&acirc;da dominates, although sometimes the old iambic form is preserved, e. g. II, 5 anta<I>h</I>pada<I>m</I>viv<I>ri</I>ttaya<I>h</I>, III, 6 anud&acirc;ttodaye puna<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>It seems evident that we have in this <I>S</I>loka form of the S&ucirc;tra period, the last preparatory stage which the development of this metre had to traverse, before it arrived at the shape which it assumes in epic poetry; and it is to be hoped that more exhaustive observations on this point (account being especially taken of the numerous verses quoted in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras) will throw an important light on the chronology of the literature of this period lying between the Vedas and the post-Vedic age.</p>  
<p>We add to these remarks on the <I>S</I>lokas quoted in the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, that we come upon a number of passages in the midst of the prose of the S&ucirc;tras, which without being in any way externally designated as verses, have an unmistakable metrical character, being evidently verses which the authors of the S&ucirc;tras found ready made, and which they used for their own aphorisms, either without changing them at all, or with such slight changes that the original form remained clearly recognisable. Thus we read in &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana (G<I>ri</I>hya I, 6, 8), as a definition of the R&acirc;kshasa marriage: hatv&acirc; bhittv&acirc; <I>k</I>a <I>s</I>&icirc;rsh&acirc;<I>n</I>i rudat&icirc;<I>m</I> rudadbhyo</p>

<p><A NAME="page_xxxvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxxvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>haret: the approximation of these words to the <I>S</I>loka metre cannot escape attention, and it is only necessary to make rudadbhya<I>h</I> and rudat&icirc;<I>m</I> change places in order to obtain a regular <I>S</I>loka hemistich. In Gobhila the S&ucirc;tras I, 2, 21-27 represent three hemistichs, which with one exception (na <I>k</I>a sop&acirc;natka<I>h</I> kva<I>k</I>it) exactly conform to the laws of the Sloka metre. II, 4, 2 gives also a hemistich by slightly changing the order:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Mah&acirc;v<I>ri</I>ksh&acirc;n <I>s</I>ma<I>s</I>&acirc;na<I>m</I> <I>k</I>a nad&icirc;<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a visham&acirc;<I>n</I>i <I>k</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</div></p>  
<p>Somewhat more remote from the original verses is the wording of the S&ucirc;tras I, 6, 8. 9 na pravasann upavased ity &acirc;hu<I>h</I>, patny&acirc; vrata<I>m</I> bhavat&icirc;ti; we have the metrical order in one of the <I>S</I>lokas quoted by <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana (G<I>ri</I>hya II, 17): nopav&acirc;sa<I>h</I> prav&acirc;se sy&acirc;t patn&icirc; dh&acirc;rayate vratam.</p>  
<p>The verses which are thus either expressly quoted, or at any rate made use of by the authors of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, do not seem to be taken from connected metrical works any more than the ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>ag&acirc;th&acirc;s quoted in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as; on the contrary in a later period of literature, when texts similar to Manu's Code were composed, they evidently furnished these texts with some of their materials&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p align="center">_______________________________</p>  
<p>Leaving out of consideration the Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya, which is evidently a recast of the Gobhil&icirc;ya-G<I>ri</I>hya, and the S&ucirc;tra of Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in, which is, at least in part, based on that of &Acirc;pastamba&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, we are not in regard to the other G<I>ri</I>hya texts in a condition to prove that one of them borrowed from the other. It often happens that single S&ucirc;tras or whole rows of S&ucirc;tras agree so exactly in different texts that this agreement cannot be ascribed to chance; but this does not&#151;so far at least&#151;enable us to tell which text is to be looked upon as the source of the</p>

<p>I will content myself with mentioning two such cases of agreement, in the one of which we can at least prove that a certain S&ucirc;tra cannot originally spring from one of the texts in which we find it, while in the other case we are able by means of a possibly not too uncertain conjecture to reconstruct the opening S&ucirc;tras of a lost G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra.</p>  
<p>The description of the v<I>ri</I>shotsarga (i.e. of the setting a bull at liberty) agrees almost word for word in the S&ucirc;tras of <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana (III, 11), P&acirc;raskara (III, 9), and in the K&acirc;<I>th</I>aka-G<I>ri</I>hya.

<p>('When the bull is in the midst of the cows, he recites over them the texts "mayobh&ucirc;<I>h</I>, &amp;c.," down to the end of the Anuv&acirc;ka.')</p>  
<p>On the other hand in P&acirc;raskara we have:</p>  
<p>&sect; 7: nabhyastham abhimantrayate mayobh&ucirc;r ity anuv&acirc;ka<I>s</I>eshe<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>('When the bull is in the midst of the cows, he recites over it the texts "mayobh&ucirc;<I>h</I>, &amp;c.," down to the end of the Anuv&acirc;ka.')</p>  
<p>The quotation mayobh&ucirc;<I>h</I> is clear, if we refer it to the <I>Ri</I>g-veda. Hymn X, 169, which stands about in the middle of an Anuv&acirc;ka, begins with this word&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. On the other hand in the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyi Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; there is no Mantra beginning with Mayobh&ucirc;<I>h</I>; we find this word in the middle of the Mantra XVIII, 45, and there follow verses whose use at the v<I>ri</I>shotsarga would seem in part extremely strange. There can thus be no doubt that P&acirc;raskara here borrowed from a S&ucirc;tra text belonging to the <I>Ri</I>g-veda, a Prat&icirc;ka, which, when referred to the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyi Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, results in nonsense.</p>  
<p>The other passage which I wish to discuss here is P&acirc;raskara</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> I, 4,1-5. P&acirc;raskara, being just on the point of describing the marriage ritual, prefixes a few sentences, the position of which here it is not very easy to understand. A general division of all P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as&#151;general remarks on the nature of the place for sacrificing: this looks very strange between a discussion of the Arghya and marriage ceremonies. Now these same sentences are found almost word for word and with the same passing on to the marriage ritual in <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana also (G<I>ri</I>hya I, 5, 1-5). Here, as in other cases, we have the borrowing word for word of such portions of text from an older text, and, closely related to this phenomenon, the fact that the sentences in question are awkwardly woven into the context of the G<I>ri</I>hya where we read them, and are poorly connected with the surrounding parts. Unless we are much deceived, we have here a fragment from an older source inserted without connection and without change. It would seem that this fragment was the beginning of the original work; for the style and contents of these S&ucirc;tras are peculiarly appropriate for the beginning. Thus, if this conjecture is right, that old lost G<I>ri</I>hya began with the main division of all the P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as into four classes, and then proceeded at once to the marriage ritual. Later, when the texts which we have, came into existence, the feeling evidently arose, that in this way an important part of the matter had been overlooked. The supplementary matter was then inserted before the old beginning, which then naturally, as is to be seen in our texts, joins on rather strangely and abruptly to these newly-added portions.</p>

It is probable that the Upanishad which &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana had in mind treated these rites not as a duty to which all were bound, but as a secret that assured the realisation of certain wishes.

<P><A NAME="fn_58"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_58">xxx:1</A> Professor Jolly in his article on the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra of Vish<I>n</I>u, p. 71, note 1, points out that in the eyes of Hindu commentators also the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras differ from the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras in that the former contain rather the universal rules, while the latter contain the rules peculiar to individual schools. Cf. Weber, Indische Literaturgeschichte, 2. Aufl., S. 296.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_59"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_59">xxx:2</A> It seems as though the choice of the Mantras which were to be prescribed for the G<I>ri</I>hya ceremonies had often been intentionally made so as to comprise as many Mantras as possible occurring in the Mantra-S&acirc;kh&acirc;, which served as foundation to the G<I>ri</I>hya texts in question.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_60"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_60">xxx:3</A> When Govindasv&acirc;min (quoted by B&uuml;hler, Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiv, p. xiii) designates the G<I>ri</I>hya<I>s</I>&acirc;str&acirc;<I>n</I>i as sarv&acirc;dhik&acirc;r&acirc;<I>n</I>i, this should not be understood literally. In general it is true the G<I>ri</I>hya acts are the same for the disciples of all the Vedic schools, but the Mantras to be used in connection with them differ.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_61"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_61">xxx:4</A> In the introduction to Gobhila I have treated of the special case where a G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra, besides being connected with one of the great Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s, is connected also with a G<I>ri</I>hya-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; of its own, so to speak, with a collection of the Mantras to be used at the G<I>ri</I>hya acts.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_62"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_62">xxxi:1</A> In the domain of the Atharva-veda literature alone we find this relation reversed; here the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra (the Vait&acirc;na-s&ucirc;tra) presupposes the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra (the Kau<I>s</I>ika-s&ucirc;tra). Cf. Prof. Garbe's preface to his edition of the Vait&acirc;na-s&ucirc;tra, p. vii. This relation is not extraordinary, considering the secondary character of the Vait&acirc;na-s&ucirc;tra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_63"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_63">xxxi:2</A> Ukt&acirc;ni vait&acirc;nik&acirc;ni, g<I>ri</I>hy&acirc;<I>n</I>i vakshy&acirc;ma<I>h</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_64"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_64">xxxii:1</A> The parallel passages from the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra and the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra of the M&acirc;navas are brought together in Dr. Von Bradke's interesting paper, 'Ueber das M&acirc;nava-G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra,' Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;nd. Gesellschaft, vol. xxxvi, p. 451.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_65"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_65">xxxii:2</A> For this reason I cannot accept the reasoning through which Prof. B&uuml;hler (Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. xiv) attempts to prove the identity of the author of the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra and of the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya school. B&uuml;hler seems to assume that the repetition of the same S&ucirc;tra, and of the same irregular grammatical form in the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra and in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, must either be purely accidental, or, if this is impossible, that it proves the identity of the authors. But there remains a third possible explanation, that the two texts are by different authors, one of whom knows and imitates the style of the other.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_66"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_66">xxxiii:1</A> Cf. my remarks in the introduction to the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya, vol. xxix, pp. 5, 6.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_68"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_68">xxxiii:3</A> Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. xxiii seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_69"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_69">xxxiv:1</A> In the work which has Khandhak&acirc; as its general title and which has been transmitted to us in two parts, Mah&acirc;vagga and <I>K</I>ullavagga.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_70"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_70">xxxiv:2</A> Compare, for instance, the explanations concerning the Upanayana in the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras (&Acirc;pastamba I, 1; Gautama I) with the corresponding sections of the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_71"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_71">xxxv:1</A> We do not mean to deny that among these verses too a few of especially modern appearance are to be found; e.g. this is true of the verses which Dr. Von Bradke has quoted from the M&acirc;nava-G<I>ri</I>hya II, 24, 34 (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;nd. Gesellschaft, vol. xxxvi, p. 429).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_72"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_72">xxxv:2</A> Let me here refer to the fact that one of these verses (&Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 7, 16) concludes with the words, 'thus said <I>S</I>aunaka.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_73"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_73">xxxv:3</A> &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya I, 3, so designates such a verse as ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>ag&acirc;th&acirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_74"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_74">xxxvi:1</A> The few verses which are found in Gobhila preserve the same metrical standard as those quoted in <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana; it follows that in Gobhila IV, 7, 23, a<I>s</I>vatth&acirc;d agnibhaya<I>m</I> br&ucirc;y&acirc;t, we cannot change br&ucirc;y&acirc;t in <I>k</I>a, as Prof. Knauer proposes. The supernumerary syllable of the first foot is unobjectionable, but the form <A NAME="img__03602"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/_03602.jpg"> of the second foot should not be touched.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_75"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_75">xxxvi:2</A> Both passages are to be found in <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-G<I>ri</I>hya I, 10.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_76"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_76">xxxvii:1</A> The text has: = nad&icirc;<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a visham&acirc;<I>n</I>i <I>k</I>a mah&acirc;v<I>ri</I>ksh&acirc;n <I>s</I>ma<I>s</I>&acirc;na<I>m</I> <I>k</I>a.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_77"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_77">xxxvii:2</A> Cf. Indische Studien, XV, 11. We do not mean to imply anything as to the metrical portions of other S&ucirc;tra texts than the G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras. As regards some verses quoted in the Baudh&acirc;yana-Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, Prof. B&uuml;hler (Sacred Books of the East, vol. xiv, p. xli) has shown that they are actually borrowed from a metrical treatise on the Sacred Law.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_78"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_78">xxxvii:3</A> Cf. Prof. B&uuml;hler's remarks, Sacred Books of the East, vol. ii, p. xxiii.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_79"></A><A HREF="sbe30002.htm#fr_79">xxxviii:1</A> In the Taittir&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (VII, 4, 17) mayobh&ucirc;<I>h</I> is the beginning of an Anuv&acirc;ka; the expression anuv&acirc;ka<I>s</I>eshe<I>n</I>a would have no meaning if referred to this text.</P>
