<p>'This offering, the creeping of I<I>d</I>&acirc;, rich in ghee, moving and not moving, accept gladly, O <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas.</p>

<p>'The night which men welcome like a cow that comes to them, (the night) which is the consort of the year, may that (night) be auspicious to us. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!</p>  
<p>'Bringing bliss to the cattle, to the wife, bringing bliss by night and by day, may this (night) which is the consort of the year, be auspicious to us. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!</p>  
<p>'The full-moon night, bringing abundance, visiting one after another, dividing the months and fortnights: may this (night), the full one, protect us. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'</p>  
<p>3.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_701"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> He sacrifices the oblation to Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t with (the verse), 'Agni, make this (sacrifice) full that it may be well offered. Be victorious, O god, in all battles. Shine far and wide, showing us a wide path. Bestow on us long life, full of splendour and free from decay. Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'</p>  
<p>4. Then he washes his hands and touches the earth with (the formulas), 'In power I establish myself, in royalty. Among the horses I establish myself, among the cows. In the limbs I establish myself, in the self. In the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as I establish myself, in prosperity. In Heaven and Earth I establish myself, in sacrifice.</p>  
<p>'May the three times eleven gods, the thirty-three, the gracious ones, whose Purohita is B<I>ri</I>haspati, on the impulse of the god Savit<I>ri</I>&#151;may the gods with (all) the gods give me bliss!'</p>

<p>8. They who know the Mantras among them, murmur the Mantras (which will be stated).</p>  
<p>9. With (the verse), 'Be soft to us, O earth, free from thorns; grant us rest; afford us wide shelter' (Taitt. Ar. X, 1, 10), and with the two (verses), 'Verily of the mountains' (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. II, 2, 12, 2. 3) they lie down on their right sides.</p>  
<p>10. With (the verse), 'Up! with life' (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. I, 2, 8, 1) they arise.</p>  
<p>11. When they have arisen, they murmur, 'We have arisen; we have become immortal.'</p>  
<p>12. In that way they (lie down and) arise that night three times.</p>

Dr. Kirste (Preface, p. viii), accordingly, believes that the three last chapters may be later additions. It may be observed in connection with this, that in the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya-G<I>ri</I>hya, which throughout is so closely related to our text, the ceremonies of the Up&acirc;kara<I>n</I>a and Utsar<I>g</I>ana, of which these three chapters treat, are not described.</P>
