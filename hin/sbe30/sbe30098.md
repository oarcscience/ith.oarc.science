### PA*T*ALA 2, SECTION 5.

1\. Having before the sacrifice gone round the fire, so that their right
sides are turned towards it,

2. <span id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_735) They sit down in their former
position, and while she takes hold of him, he offers the oblations
(indicated by the) next (Mantras), with (the Mantras), 'To Soma, the
acquirer of a wife, Svâhâ!' (M. I, 4, I-16), one oblation with each
Mantra.

3. <span id="fr_736"></span>[3](#fn_736) He then causes her, to the
north of the fire, to tread with her right foot on a stone, with (the
verse), 'Tread' (M. I, 5, 1).

4\. Having 'spread under' Â*g*ya into her joined hands, he pours roasted
grain twice (into them), and sprinkles Â*g*ya over it.

5\. Some say that an uterine relation of hers pours the grain (into her
hands).

6. <span id="fr_737"></span>[6](#fn_737) He (?) sacrifices (that grain)
with (the verse), 'This wife' (M. I, 5, 2).

7. <span id="fr_738"></span>[7](#fn_738) Having gone round the fire,
with the right side turned towards it, with the next three (verses; M.
I, 5, 3-5) he makes her tread on the stone as above (M. I, 5, 6).

8\. And the oblation (is performed) with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 7).

9\. (Then follow) again the circumambulation (M. I, 5, 8-10), the
injunction to tread on the stone

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (I, 5, 11), and
the oblation with the next (verse; I, 5, 12);

10\. (Then) the circumambulation again (I, 5, 13-15).

11. <span id="fr_739"></span>[11](#fn_739) He enters upon the
performance of the *G*aya and following oblations.

12. <span id="fr_740"></span>[12](#fn_740) Having performed (the rites)
down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire), and having untied
the rope with the next two verses (I, 5, 16. 17), he should then make
her depart (from her father's house in a vehicle), or should have her
taken away.

13\. Having put that fire (with which the marriage rites have been
performed, into a vessel), they carry it behind (the newly-married
couple).

14\. It should be kept constantly.

15\. If it goes out, (a new fire) should be kindled by attrition,

16\. Or it should be fetched from the house of a *S*rotriya.

17\. Besides, if (the fire) goes out, one of them, either the wife or
the husband, should fast.

18\. Or he may sacrifice with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 18), and not
fast.

19\. The next (verse; M. I, 6, 1) is for putting the chariot (on which
the young couple is to depart), in position;

20\. With the next two (verses; M. I, 6, 2. 3), he puts the two animals
to the chariot;

21\. First the right one.

22\. When she mounts (the chariot), he recites over her the next
(verses; M. I, 6, 4-7).

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

23\. With the next (verse; M. I, 6, 8), he spreads out two threads in
the wheel-tracks (in which the chariot is to go), a dark-blue one in the
right (track), a red one in the left.

24\. With the next (verses; M. I, 6, 9-11), he walks on these (threads).

25\. And when they pass by bathing-places, posts, or cross-roads, let
him murmur the next (verse; M. I, 6, 12).
