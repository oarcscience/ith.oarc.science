2\. The other (i.e. the teacher) has to ask; the boy has to answer (II,
3, 27-30).

3\. The other murmurs the rest (of the Anuvâka),

4\. And causes the boy to repeat (the Mantra) which contains wishes for

northward-pointed grass; on that (the teacher) who performs the
initiation, sits down with the next Ya*g*us (M. II, 4, 12).

8\. The boy, sitting to the east (of him), facing the west, seizes with
his right hand (the teacher's) right foot and says, 'Recite the Sâvitrî,
Sir!'

9\. He recites (the Sâvitrî) to him, 'That (glorious splendour) of
Savit*ri*' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 5, 6, 4; M. 4, 13);

10\. Pâda by Pâda, hemistich by hemistich, and the whole (verse).

beginning or at the end) of the hemistichs; the last (Vyâh*ri*ti, when

15\. With the next (II, 5, 1) he takes up the staff.

16. <span id="fr_761"></span>[16](#fn_761.md) The staff of a Brâhma*n*a is
made of Palâ*s*a wood, that of a Râ*g*anya of a branch of the Nyagrodha

the staff), that of a Vai*s*ya of Bâdara or Udumbara wood.

17\. Some state (only), without any reference to caste, that the staff
should be made of the wood of a tree:

18\. After (the teacher) has made him repeat (the formula), 'My memory'
(M. II, 5, 2), and he has bestowed an optional gift on his teacher, and
(the teacher) has made him arise with (the formula, M. II, 5, 3), 'Up,
with life!' (the student) worships the sun with the next (Mantras; II,
5, 4).

19\. If (the teacher) wishes, 'May this (student) not be estranged from
me,' let him take (the student) by the right hand with the next (verse;

21\. And (during that time) salted and pungent food should be avoided.

kept no longer),

24\. Fetching fuel regularly from the forest.
