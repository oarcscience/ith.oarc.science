### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 6 SECTION 16.

1\. Now (follows) the *S*rava*n*â ceremony.

2\. On the day of that full moon which falls under (the Nakshatra)
*S*rava*n*a, after the evening Agnihotra he puts wood on the (third of
the three *S*rauta fires, called the) Dakshi*n*âgni. One who has not set
up the (*S*rauta) fires, (does the same with) the sacred domestic fire.

3\. Then he procures unbroken grains, unbroken fried grains, coarsely
ground grains, (leaves and blossoms) of the Ki*ms*uka tree, collyrium
and (other) salve, and Â*g*ya.

4\. Having 'spread under' (Â*g*ya) in the (spoon called) Darvi, he cuts
off (the Avadânas) of those kinds of food (mentioned in Sûtra 3), mixes
them with clarified butter, and sacrifices (with the formulas),
'Adoration to Agni the terrestrial, the lord of terrestrial beings!
Svâhâ! Adoration to Vâyu the all-pervading, the lord of aerial beings!
Svâhâ! Adoration to Sûrya, the red one, the lord of celestial beings!
Svâhâ! Adoration to Vish*n*u, the whitish one, the lord of the beings
that dwell in the quarters (of the world). Svâhâ!'

5. <span id="fr_696"></span>[5](#fn_696.md) He anoints the Ki*ms*uka
(flowers and leaves) with Â*g*ya, and sacrifices with (the Mantras),
'Devoured is the gadfly; devoured is thirst (?); devoured is the
stinging worm.' 'Devoured is the stinging worm; devoured is thirst;
devoured is the gadfly.'

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Devoured is
thirst; devoured is the gadfly; devoured is the stinging worm.'

6\. He takes a water-pot and a handful of Darbha grass, goes forth, his
face turned towards the east, spreads the Darbha grass out with its
points towards the east, and makes four Bali-offerings on that (grass)
with (the formulas), 'To the terrestrial Serpents I offer this Bali,'
'To the aerial, &c.; to the celestial, &c.; to the Serpents dwelling in
the quarters (of the world),' &c.

7\. Having given there collyrium and (other) salve (to the Serpents), he
worships them with the Mantras, 'Adoration be to the Serpents' (Taitt.
Sa*m*hitâ IV, 2, 8, 3).

8. <span id="fr_697"></span>[8](#fn_697.md) He should take a water-pot and
should at that distance in which he wishes the serpents not to approach,
three times walk round his house, turning his right side towards it, and
should sprinkle water round it with (the formulas), 'Beat away, O white
one, with thy foot, with the fore-foot and with the hind-foot, these
seven human females and the three (daughters) of the king's tribe.

'Within the dominion of the white one the Serpent has killed nobody. To
the white one, the son of Vidarva, adoration!

'Adoration to the white one, the son of Vidarva!'

9\. Then he worships the Serpents towards the different regions, one by
one with (the corresponding section of) these Mantras, 'The convergent
one thou art called, the eastern region' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. V, 5, 10, 1
seq.).

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

10\. From that time he daily makes the Bali-offerings till the full-moon
day of Mârga*s*îrsha.

11\. Here the Ki*ms*uka offerings (see § 5) are not repeated.

12\. The sprinkling (of water) round (the house) does not take place
(see § 8).

13. <span id="fr_698"></span>[13](#fn_698.md) The last Bali he offers with
(the words), 'Going to acquit myself, going to acquit myself.'

End of the Sixth Pa*t*ala.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_696"></span>[237:5](sbe30088.htm#fr_696.md) I am not sure
about the translation of vi*k*ash*t*i. Perhaps it is only a blunder for
vit*ri*sh*t*i, which is the reading of the Âpastambîya Mantrapâ*th*a.
Comp. Winternitz, Der Sarpabali, ein altindischer Schlangencult (Wien,
1888), p. 28.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[238:8](sbe30088.htm#fr_697.md) Comp. Pâraskara
II, 14, 19.- In the first Mantra I read râ*g*abândhavî*h*; comp. the
note on Par. II, 14, 4.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[239:13](sbe30088.htm#fr_698.md) Some authorities
understand, as Mât*ri*datta states, that he should offer the Bali only
with the words as they stand in the Sûtra, others prescribe the formula
(comp. § 6): 'To the terrestrial (aerial, &c.) Serpents I offer this
Bali going to acquit myself, going to acquit myself.'
