*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 4, SECTION 15.

1. <span id="fr_584"></span>[1](#fn_584) With (the verse.md), 'If we trade,
O gods, trying by our wealth to acquire (new) wealth, O gods, may

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Soma thereon
bestow splendour, Agni, Indra, B*ri*haspati, and Î*s*âna. Svâhâ!'

2\. Now (follows) the way for appeasing anger.

3. <span id="fr_585"></span>[3](#fn_585.md) He addresses the angry person
with (the verses), 'The power of wrath that dwells here on thy forehead,
destroying thy enemy (?), may the chaste, wise gods take that away.

'If thou shootest, as it were, the thought dwelling in thy face, upwards
to thy forehead, I loosen the anger of thy heart like the bow-string of
an archer.

'Day, heaven, and earth: we appease thy anger, as the womb of a she-mule
(cannot conceive).'

4\. Now (follows) the way for obtaining the victory in disputes.

5. <span id="fr_586"></span>[5](#fn_586.md) He puts wood on the fire at
night-time in an inner apartment, performs the rites down to the
Vyâh*ri*ti oblations, and sacrifices small grains mixed with A ya, with
(the verse), 'Tongueless one, thou who art without a tongue! I drive
thee away through my sacrifice, so that I may gain the victory in the
dispute, and that N.N. may be defeated by me. Svâhâ!'

6. <span id="fr_587"></span>[6](#fn_587.md) Then in the presence (of his
adversary), turned towards him, he murmurs (the verses), 'I take away
the speech from thy mouth, (the speech) that dwells in thy mind, (the
speech) from thy heart. Out of every limb I take thy speech. Wheresoever
thy speech dwells, thence I take it away.

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

'Rudra with the dark hair-lock! Hero! At every contest strike down this
my adversary, as a tree (is struck down) by a thunderbolt.

'Be defeated, be conquered, when thou speakest. Sink down under the
earth, when thou speakest, struck down by me irresistibly (?) with the
hammer of . . . (?). That is true what I speak. Fall down, inferior to
me, N.N.!'

7. <span id="fr_588"></span>[7](sbe30059.htm#fn_588.md) He touches the
assembly-hall (in which the contest is going on), and murmurs, 'The
golden-armed, blessed (goddess), whose eyes are not faint, who is decked
with ornaments, seated in the midst of the gods, has spoken for my good.
Svâhâ!'

8. <span id="fr_589"></span>[8](sbe30059.htm#fn_589.md) 'For me have the
high ones and the low ones, for me has this wide earth, for me have Agni
and Indra accomplished my divine aim'—with (this verse) he looks at the
assembly, and murmurs (it) turned towards (the assembly).

End of the Fourth Pa*t*ala.
