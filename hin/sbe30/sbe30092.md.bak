### PA*T*ALA 8, SECTION 20.

1. <span id="fr_708"></span>[1](#fn_708.md) For Vai*s*ampâyana, Paliṅgu,
Tittira \[sic\], Ukha, Âtreya, the author of the Pada-text, Kau*nd*inya
the author of the commentary, for the authors of the Sûtras, for
Satyâshâ*dh*a (Hira*n*yake*s*in), for the handers-down of the text, for
the teachers, the *Ri*shis, the hermits dwelling in the woods, the
chaste ones, for those who have only one wife.

2\. They prepare (seats) each for his own fathers and maternal
ancestors.

3\. With (the words), 'For N.N. I prepare (a seat); for N.N. I prepare
(a seat)' (he prepares) a seat.

4\. With (the words), 'I satiate N.N.; I satiate N.N.' (he makes
offerings of) water.

5\. With (the words), 'Adoration to N: N.! Adoration to N.N.!' (he
offers) perfumes, flowers, incense, and lamps.

6\. With (the words), 'To N.N. svâhâ! To N.N. svâhâ!' (he offers) food.

7\. With (the words), 'I satiate N.N.; I satiate N.N.' (he offers) water
with fruits in it.

8\. Having worshipped them with (the words), 'Adoration to N.N.!
Adoration to N.N.!'—

9. <span id="fr_709"></span>[9](#fn_709.md) Having put wood on the fire to
the west of the surface (on which he had performed the Tarpa*n*a),

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

and having performed the rites down to the Vyâh*ri*ti oblations (&c., as
above, chap. 18, 3-7).

10\. With the two (verses), 'From joint to joint,' 'Thou who with a
hundred' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 2, 9, 2) they plant Dûrvâ grass at the
shore of the water.

11\. They stir up waves in the water and run a race in an easterly or
northerly direction until they lose their breath.

12\. When they have returned (from that race? or when they have returned
from the whole ceremony to the village?) they offer cakes, coarsely
ground grain, and boiled rice to the Brâhma*n*as.

13. <span id="fr_710"></span>[13](#fn_710) The same (rites are repeated.md)
when they have finished the study of the whole Veda, with the exception
of the planting of Dûrvâ grass, of (stirring up) the water, and of the
race.

14\. Thus they satiate daily (after the Brahmaya*gñ*a) the gods, the
*Ri*shis, and the Fathers with water; they satiate them with water.

End of the Hira*n*yake*s*i-sûtra.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_708"></span>[245:1](sbe30092.htm#fr_708.md) 20, 1. The
Kâ*nd*ânukrama of the Âtreyî-*s*âkhâ, which has been printed by
Professor Weber in his edition of the Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ, vol. ii, p.
356, shows that the dative Paliṅgave ought to be corrected to Paiṅgaye.
The 'v*ri*ttikâra' is there called not Kau*nd*inya, but Ku*nd*ina.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[245:9](sbe30092.htm#fr_709.md) There is only one
difference between the text of this Sutra <span id="page_246">p.
246</span> and that of chap. 18, 3-7: instead of hutvâ trîn
âdito<sup>ऽ</sup>nuvâkân adhîyate (18, 4) we read here, hutvâ
prathamenânuvâkenâdhîyate, which I believe must be translated, 'Having
sacrificed with the first Anuvâka, they recite (that Anuvâka).'
Mât*ri*datta says, hutvâ prathamottamânuvâkam adhîyate.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[246:13](sbe30092.htm#fr_710.md) See Sûtras 10 and
11.
