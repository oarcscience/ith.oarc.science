### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 5, SECTION 16. <span id="fr_590"></span>[16](#fn_590.md)

1\. When he has first seen the new moon, he sips water, and holding (a
pot of) water (in his hands) he worships (the moon) with the four
(verses), 'Increase' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 4, 32), 'May thy milk' (ibid.
IV, 2, 7, 4), 'New and new again (the moon) becomes, being born' (ibid.
II, 4, 14, 1), 'That Soma which the Âdityas make swell' (ibid. II, 4,
14, 1).

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

2. <span id="fr_591"></span>[2](#fn_591.md) When he has yawned, he murmurs,
'(May) will and insight (dwell) in me.'

3. <span id="fr_592"></span>[3](#fn_592) If the skirt (of his garment.md)
is blown upon him (by the wind), he murmurs, 'A skirt art thou. Thou art
not a thunderbolt. Adoration be to thee. Do no haft to me.'

4\. He should tear off a thread (from that skirt) and should blow it
away with his mouth.

5. <span id="fr_593"></span>[5](#fn_593.md) If a bird has befouled him with
its excrements, he murmurs, 'The birds that timidly fly together with
the destroyers, shall pour out on me happy, blissful splendour and
vigour.'

Then let him wipe off that (dirt) with something else than his hand, and
let him wash himself with water.

6. <span id="fr_594"></span>[6](#fn_594.md) 'From the sky, from the wide
air a drop of water has fallen down on me, bringing luck. With my
senses, with my mind I have united myself, protected by the prayer that
is brought forth by the righteous ones'—this (verse) he should murmur,
if a drop of water unexpectedly falls down on him.

7. <span id="fr_595"></span>[7](#fn_595.md) 'If a fruit has fallen down
from the top of a tree, or from the air, it is Vâyu (who has made it
fall). Where it has touched our bodies or the garment, (there) may the
waters drive away destruction'—this (verse) he should murmur, if a fruit
unexpectedly falls down on him.

8. <span id="fr_596"></span>[8](#fn_596.md) 'Adoration to him who dwells at
the cross-roads,

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

whose arrow is the wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells at the
cross-roads!'—this (formula) he murmurs when he comes to a cross-road;

9\. 'Adoration to him who dwells among cattle, whose arrow is the wind,
to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells among cattle!'—thus at a
dung-heap;

10\. 'Adoration to him who dwells among the serpents, whose arrow is the
wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells among the serpents!'—thus
at a place that is frequented by serpents.

11\. 'Adoration to him who dwells in the air, whose arrow is the wind,
to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the air!'—this (formula) let
him murmur, if overtaken by a tornado.

12\. 'Adoration to him who dwells in the waters, whose arrow is the
wind, to Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells in the waters!'—this
(formula) he murmurs when plunging into a river which is full of water.

13\. 'Adoration to him who dwells there, whose arrow is the wind, to
Rudra! Adoration to Rudra who dwells there!'—this (formula) he murmurs
when approaching a beautiful place, a sacrificial site, or a big tree.

14. <span id="fr_597"></span>[14](#fn_597.md) If the sun rises whilst he is
sleeping, he shall fast that day and shall stand silent during that day;

15\. The same during the night, if the sun sets whilst he sleeps.

16. <span id="fr_598"></span>[16](#fn_598.md) Let him not touch a
sacrificial post. By

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

touching it, he would bring upon himself (the guilt of) whatever faults
have been committed at that sacrifice. If he touches one (sacrificial
post), he should say, 'This is thy wind;' if two (posts), 'These are thy
two winds;' if many (posts), 'These are thy winds.'

17. <span id="fr_599"></span>[17](#fn_599.md) 'The voices that are heard
after us (?) and around us, the praise that is heard, and the voices of
the birds, the deer's running (?) athwart: that we fear (?) from our
enemies'—this (verse) he murmurs when setting out on a road.

18. <span id="fr_600"></span>[18](#fn_600.md) 'Like an Udgât*ri*, O bird,
thou singest the Sâman; like a Brahman's son thou recitest thy hymn,
when the Soma is pressed.

'A blessing on us, O bird; bring us luck and be kind towards us!'—(This
Mantra) he murmurs against an inauspicious bird;

19. <span id="fr_601"></span>[19](#fn_601.md) 'If thou raisest thy divine
voice, entering upon living beings, drive away our enemies by thy voice.
O death, lead them to death!'—(thus) against a solitary jackal.

20\. Then he throws before the (jackal, as it were), a fire-brand that
burns at both ends, towards that region (in which the jackal's voice is
heard), with (the words), 'Fire! Speak to the fire! Death! Speak to the
death!' Then he touches water,

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

21\. And worships (the jackal) with the Anuvâka, 'Thou art mighty, thou
carriest away' (Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ I, 3, 3).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_588"></span>[179:7](sbe30058.htm#fr_588.md) Probably we should
write a*g*îtâkshî.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[179:8](sbe30058.htm#fr_589.md) Mât*ri*datta says,
prativâdinam abhi*g*apaty eva.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[179:16](sbe30059.htm#fr_590.md) This chapter
contains different Prâya*sk*ittas.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[180:2](sbe30059.htm#fr_591.md)
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya. III, 6, 7.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[180:3](sbe30059.htm#fr_592.md) Pâraskara III, 15,
17.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[180:5](sbe30059.htm#fr_593.md) I propose to read,
nir*ri*thai*h* saha.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[180:6](sbe30059.htm#fr_594.md) Atharva-veda VI,
124, 1. Read suk*ri*tâ*m* k*ri*tena.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[180:7](sbe30059.htm#fr_595.md) Atharva-veda VI,
124, 2. The Atharva-veda shows the way to correct the corrupt third
Pâda.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[180:8](sbe30059.htm#fr_596.md) 8 seq. Comp.
Pâraskara III, 15, 7 seq.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[181:14](sbe30059.htm#fr_597.md) 14, 15. Âpastamba
II, 5, 1 2, 13. 14; Gobhila III, 3, 34, &c.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[181:16](sbe30059.htm#fr_598.md) Gobhila III, 3,
34. Should it be esha te vâyur iti?

<span id="fn_599"></span>[182:17](sbe30059.htm#fr_599.md) The Mantra is
very corrupt. Perhaps anihûtam should be corrected into anuhûtam, which
is the reading of the Âpastambîya Mantrapâ*th*a. In the last Pâda
bhayâmasi is corrupt; the meaning seems to be, 'that we (avert from
ourselves and) turn it to our enemies.' Probably Dr. Kirste is right in
reading bha*g*âmasi.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[182:18](sbe30059.htm#fr_600.md) Comp. *Ri*g-veda

(S.B.E., II, 38). Mât*ri*datta says, *sri*gâlo m*ri*ga*s*abda*m*
kurvâ*n*a ekas*ri*ka ity u*k*yate.
