### PA*T*ALA 5, SECTION 18.

1. <span id="fr_606"></span>[1](#fn_606) 'May Indra and Agni make you
go. May the two A*s*vins protect you. B*ri*haspati is your herdsman. May
Pûshan drive you back again'—

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

this (verse) he recites over the cows when they go away (to their
pasture-grounds), and (the verse), 'May Pûshan go after our cows'
(Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 1, 11, 2).

2\. With (the verse), 'These cows that have come hither, free from
disease and prolific, may they swim (full of wealth) like rivers; may
they pour out (wealth), as (rivers discharge their floods) into the
ocean'—he looks at the cows, when they are coming back.

3. <span id="fr_607"></span>[3](#fn_607) With (the formula), 'You are a
stand at rest; may I (?) become your stand at rest. You are immovable.
Do not move from me. May I not move from you, the blessed ones'—(he
looks at them) when they are standing still.

4\. With (the formula), 'I see you full of sap. Full of sap you shall
see me'—(he looks at them) when they are gone into the stable, and with
(the formula), 'May I be prosperous through your thousandfold
prospering.'

5. <span id="fr_608"></span>[5](#fn_608) Then having put wood on the
fire amid the cows, and having performed the rites down to the
Vyâh*ri*ti (oblations), he makes oblations of milk with (the verses),

'Blaze brightly, O *G*âtavedas, driving destruction away from me. Bring
me cattle and maintenance from all quarters of the heaven. Svâhâ!

'May *G*âtavedas do no harm to us, to cows and horses, to men and to all
that moves. Come hither,

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni, fearlessly;
make me attain to welfare! Svâhâ!'—

And with (the two verses), 'This is the influx of the waters,' and
'Adoration to thee, the rapid one, the shining one' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV,
6, 1, 3).

6\. Then follow oblations with the verses), 'This, O Varu*n*a' (&c.; see
I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sûtra).

End of the Fifth Pa*t*ala.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_606"></span>[184:1](sbe30061.htm#fr_606) 18, 1 seq. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana III, 9; Gobhila III, 6; Â*s*valâyana II, 10.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[185:3](sbe30061.htm#fr_607) The Mantra is very
corrupt. I think it ought to be corrected somehow in the following way:
sa*m*sthâ stha sa*m*sthâ vo bhtûyâsam a*k*yutâ stha ma ma*k*
*k*yo*dh*vam mâha*m* bhavatîbhya*s* *k*yoshi. Comp. also Dr. Kirste's
note.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[185:5](sbe30061.htm#fr_608) In the second
verse I propose to change abibhrad into <span id="page_186">p.
186</span> abibhyad; comp. Atharva-veda XIX, 65, 1: ava tâ*m* *g*ahi
harasâ *G*âtavedo<sup>ऽ</sup>bibhyad ugro<sup>ऽ</sup> r*k*ishâ divam â
roha sûrya. The last words of this verse should be *s*riyam mâ
pratipâdaya, or something similar.
