### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 2, SECTION 5.

1. <span id="fr_500"></span>[1](#fn_500) 'To him who comes (to us.md), we
have come. Drive ye away death! May we walk with him safely; may he walk
here in bliss; (may he) walk in bliss until (he returns) to his
house'—this (verse the teacher repeats) while (the boy) walks round the
fire so as to keep his right side turned towards it.

2. <span id="fr_501"></span>[2](#fn_501) (The teacher.md) then causes him
to say, 'I have come hither to be a student. Initiate me! I will be a
student, impelled by the god Sâvitrî.'

3\. (The teacher then) asks him:

4\. 'What is thy name?'

5. <span id="fr_502"></span>[5](#fn_502.md) He says, 'N.N!'—what his name
is.

6. <span id="fr_503"></span>[6](#fn_503) (The teacher says.md), 'Happily,
god Savit*ri*, may I attain the goal with this N.N.'—here he pronounces
(the student's) two names.

7. <span id="fr_504"></span>[7](#fn_504) With (the verse.md), 'For bliss
may the goddesses afford us their protection; may the waters afford
drink to us. With bliss and happiness may they overflow us'—both wipe
themselves off.

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

8. <span id="fr_505"></span>[8](#fn_505) Then (the teacher.md) touches with
his right hand (the boy's) right shoulder, and with his left (hand) his
left (shoulder), and draws (the boy's) right arm towards himself with
the Vyâh*ri*tis, the Sâvitrî verse, and with (the formula), 'By the
impulse of the god Savit*ri*, with the arms of the two A*s*vins, with
Pûshan's hands I initiate thee, N.N.!'

9. <span id="fr_506"></span>[9](#fn_506.md) He then seizes with his right
hand (the boy's) right hand together with the thumb, with (the words),
'Agni has seized thy hand; Soma has seized thy hand; Savit*ri* has
seized thy hand; Sarasvatî has seized thy hand; Pûshan has seized thy
hand; B*ri*haspati has seized thy hand; Mitra has seized thy hand;
Varu*n*a has seized thy hand; Tvash*tri* has seized thy hand; Dhât*ri*
has seized thy hand; Vish*n*u has seized thy hand; Pra*g*âpati has
seized thy hand.'

10. <span id="fr_507"></span>[10](#fn_507.md) 'May Savit*ri* protect thee.
Mitra art thou by rights; Agni is thy teacher.

'By the impulse of the god Savit*ri* become B*ri*haspati's pupil. Eat
water. Put on fuel. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time'—thus
(the teacher) instructs him.

11. <span id="fr_508"></span>[11](#fn_508) Then (the teacher.md) gradually
moves his right

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

hand down over (the boy's) right shoulder and touches the place of his
heart with (the formulas), 'Thy heart shall dwell in my heart; my mind
thou shalt follow with thy mind; in my word thou shalt rejoice with all
thy heart; may B*ri*haspati join thee to me!

'To me alone thou shalt adhere. In me thy thoughts shall dwell. Upon me
thy veneration shall be bent. When I speak, thou shalt be silent.'

12\. With (the words), 'Thou art the knot of all breath; do not loosen
thyself'—(he touches) the place of his navel.

13. <span id="fr_509"></span>[13](#fn_509) After (the teacher.md) has
recited over him (the formula),

'Bhû*h*! Bhuva*h*! Suva*h*! By offspring may I become rich in offspring!
By valiant sons, rich in valiant sons! By splendour, rich in splendour!
By wealth, rich in wealth! By wisdom, rich in wisdom! By pupils, rich in
holy lustre!'

And (again the formulas),

'Bhû*h*! I place thee in the *Rik*as, in Agni, on the earth, in voice,
in the Brahman, N.N.!

'Bhuva*h*! I place thee in the Ya*g*us, in Vâyu, in the air, in breath,
in the Brahman, N.N.!

'Suva*h*! I place thee in the Sâmans, in Sûrya, in heaven, in the eye,
in the Brahman, N.N.!

'May I be beloved (?) and dear to thee, N.N.!

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> May I be dear to
thee, the fire (?), N.N.! Let us dwell here! Let us dwell in breath and
life! Dwell in breath and life, N.N.!'—

14. <span id="fr_510"></span>[14](#fn_510.md) He then seizes with his right
hand (the boy's) right hand together with the thumb, with the five
sections, 'Agni is long-lived.'

15\. 'May (Agni) bestow on thee long life everywhere' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I,
3, 14, 4)—

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_500"></span>[150:1](sbe30048.htm#fr_500.md) 5, 1. I read, pra
su m*ri*tyu*m* yvyotana; comp. Mantra-Brâhma*n*a I, 6, 14 (*Ri*g-veda I,
136, 1, &c.). As to the last Pâda, comp. *Ri*g-veda III, 53, 20.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[150:2](sbe30048.htm#fr_501.md) 2 seq. Comp.
Gobhila II, 20, 21 seq.; Pâraskara II, 2, 6; *S*âṅkhâyana II, 2, 4, &c.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[150:5](sbe30048.htm#fr_502.md) Mât*ri*datta, 'As
it is said below, "he pronounces his two names" (Sûtra 6), the student
should here also pronounce his two names, for instance, "I am Devadatta,
Kârttika."'

<span id="fn_503"></span>[150:6](sbe30048.htm#fr_503.md) 'His common
(vyâvahârika) name and his Nakshatra name.' Mât*ri*datta.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[150:7](sbe30048.htm#fr_504.md) *Ri*g-veda X, 9,
4.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[151:8](sbe30048.htm#fr_505.md) The word which I
have translated 'draws . . . towards himself' is the same which is also
used in the sense of 'he initiates him' (upanayate). Possibly we should
correct the text: dakshi*n*a*m* bâhum anv abhyâtmam upanayate, 'he turns
him towards himself from left to right (literally, following his right
arm).' Comp. *S*âṅkhâyana II, 3, 2.—Regarding the Mantra, comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana II, 2, 12, &c.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[151:9](sbe30048.htm#fr_506.md) *S*âṅkhâyana II,
2, 11; 3, 1, &c.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[151:10](sbe30048.htm#fr_507.md) *S*âṅkhâyana II,
3, 1; 4, 5. We ought to read apo<sup>ऽ</sup>*s*âna, instead of
apo<sup>ऽ</sup>sâna*h* as the MSS. have.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[151:11](sbe30048.htm#fr_508.md) *S*âṅkhâyana II,
4, 1, &c.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[152:13](sbe30048.htm#fr_509.md) The reading of
the last Mantra is doubtful. Ish*t*atas should possibly be ish*t*as, but
the genitive analasya, or, as some of the MSS. have, ana*l*asya (read,
analasasya?), points rather to a genitive like i*kkh*atas. If we write
i*kkh*atas and analasasya, the translation would be: 'May I be dear to
thee, who loves me, N.N.! May I be dear to thee, who art zealous, N.N.!'
Comp. *S*âṅkhâyana II, 3, 3.

Sûtra 9.
