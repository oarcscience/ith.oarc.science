*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 9.

1. <span id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_331.md) On the Âgrahâya*n*î day (or the
full-moon day of the month Mârga*s*îrsha) Bali-offerings (are made).

2. <span id="fr_332"></span>[2](#fn_332.md) They have been explained by the
*S*râva*n*a sacrifice.

3. <span id="fr_333"></span>[3](#fn_333) He does not murmur (here.md) the
Mantra, 'Adoration to the Earth’s.'

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

4\. In the morning, after he has sacrificed the (regular) morning
oblation, he should have the following (plants and branches of trees)
fetched, viz. Darbha grass, a *S*ami (branch), Vîri*n*a grass, a (Badarî
branch) with fruits, Apâmârga, and *S*irîsha. He then should silently
throw (a portion) of flour of fried barley into the fire, should cause
the Brâhma*n*as to pronounce auspicious wishes, and should
circumambulate the house, turning his right side towards it, starting
from the room for the (sacred) fire, striking the smoke (of the sacred
fire) with those objects (i.e. with the plants and branches mentioned
above).

5\. He should throw away those objects, after he has made use of them.

6. <span id="fr_334"></span>[6](#fn_334.md) On solid stones he places a
water-barrel with the two (Sâmans belonging to the verse), 'Vâstoshpati'
(Sâma-veda I, 275) and with (that) *Rik* (itself).

7\. Let him pour two pots of water into that barrel with this verse,
'Some assemble' (Sâma-veda-Âra*n*yaka, vol. ii, p. 292, ed. Bibl.
Indica).

8. <span id="fr_335"></span>[8](#fn_335.md) In the evening boiled
rice-grains with milk (are prepared).

9\. Of that (milk-rice) he should make an oblation with (the Mantra),
'She shone forth as the first' (MB. II, 2, 1).

10. <span id="fr_336"></span>[10](#fn_336.md) The rest (should be
performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

11\. To the west of the fire he touches the Barhis with his two hands
turned downwards, and murmurs the Vyâh*ri*tis (i.e. the solemn
utterances), 'In the Kshatra I establish myself' (ibid. 2. 3).

12\. To the west of the fire he should have a layer spread out,

13\. Of northward-pointed grass,

14\. Inclined towards the north.

15\. After they have spread out on that (grass) new rugs, the
householder sits down (thereon) on the southern side.

16\. Then without an interval the others according to their age,

17\. And without an interval their wives, each with her children.

18\. When they are seated, the householder touches the layer (of grass)
with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the verse, 'Be soft to
us, O Earth' (ibid. 4).

19\. When he has finished that (verse), they lie down on their right
sides.

20. <span id="fr_337"></span>[20](#fn_337.md) In the same way (they lie
down on their right sides) three times, turning themselves towards
themselves (i.e. turning round forwards, not backwards, and thus
returning to their former position?).

21\. They repeat the auspicious hymns as far as they know them;

22. <span id="fr_338"></span>[22](#fn_338.md) The complex of Sâmans called
Arish*t*a, according to some (teachers).

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

23\. Having touched water, they may do whatever they like.

Âgrahâya*n*î ceremony by which the rites devoted to the Serpents are
concluded. Khâdira-G*ri*hya III, 3, 16 seq.

To the west of that fire he touches the <span id="page_95">p. 95</span>
earth with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the Mantra,
'Adoration to the Earth’s.'

<span id="fn_334"></span>[95:6](sbe30031.htm#fr_334.md) He sings the two
Kâvasha Sâmans of which the verse Sâma-veda I, 275 is considered as the

note.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[96:20](sbe30031.htm#fr_337.md) The explanation
which the commentary gives of this difficult Sutra can hardly be
accepted: trir âv*ri*tya tri*h*k*ri*tvo<sup>ऽ</sup>bhyasya . . .

sarvalokaprasiddha*m* prayu*g*ya.
