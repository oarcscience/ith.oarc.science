### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 1, SECTION 1,

1\. Now (follows) the Sîmantonnayana (or parting of the pregnant wife's
hair).

2\. In the fourth month of her first pregnancy, in the fortnight of the
increasing moon, under an auspicious constellation he puts wood on the
fire, performs the rites down to the Vyâh*ri*ti oblations, and makes
four oblations to Dhât*ri* with (the verse), 'May Dhât*ri* give us
wealth' (and the following three verses, Taitt. Sa*m*h. III, 3, II, 2.
3).

3. <span id="fr_645"></span>[3](#fn_645.md) 'This, O Varu*n*a' (&c.; see I,
chap. 27, Sûtra 2, down to): 'Hail! Good luck!'

He then makes the wife who has taken a bath, who wears a clean dress and
ornaments, and has spoken with a Brâhma*n*a, sit down to the west of the
fire, facing the east, in a round apartment. Standing to the east (of
the wife), facing the west he parts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning
from the front) with a porcupine's quill that has three white spots,
holding (also) a bunch of unripe fruits, with the Vyâh*ri*tis (and) with
the two (verses), 'I invoke Râkâ,' (and), 'Thy graces, O Râkâ' (Taitt.
Sa*m*h. III, 3, 11, 5). Then he recites over (his wife the formulas),
'Soma alone is our king, thus say the Brâhma*n*a tribes, sitting near
thy banks, O Gaṅgâ,

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

whose wheel does not roll back (?)!' (and), 'May we find our way with
thee through all hostile powers, as through streams of water' (above I,
20, 5).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_645"></span>[208:3](sbe30073.htm#fr_645.md) 1, 3. The corrupt
word viv*ri*tta*k*akrâ(*h*) seems to contain a vocative fem. referring
to Gaṅge—aviv*ri*tta*k*akra? The Âpastambîya Mantrapâ*th*a reads,
viv*ri*tta*k*akra âsînâs tîre*n*a yamune tava. Comp. Â*s*valâyana I, 14,
7; Pâraskara I, 15, 8.
