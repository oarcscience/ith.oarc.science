<p>1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Now follows the tonsure of the child's head, in the third year.</p>  
<p>2.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> To the east of the house on a surface besmeared (with cow-dung) wood has been put on the fire.</p>  
<p>3. There the following things have been placed:</p>  
<p>4. To the south (of the fire) twenty-one Darbha blades, a brass vessel with hot water, a razor of Udumbara wood or a mirror, and a barber with a razor in his hand;</p>  
<p>5.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> To the north, bull's dung and a mess of boiled rice with sesamum seeds which may be more or less cooked.</p>  
<p>6.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> Let them fill vessels separately with rice and barley, with sesamum seeds and beans, and let them place (those vessels) to the east (of the fire).</p>  
<p>7. The boiled rice with sesamum seeds (Sutra 5) and all seeds (mentioned in S&ucirc;tra 6) are given to the barber.</p>  
<p>8. Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment, sits down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. To the west (of her), facing the east, the person stations himself who is going to perform that (ceremony).</p>  
<p>10. He then murmurs, fixing his thoughts on Savit<I>ri</I>, looking at the barber, (the Mantra), 'Hither has come Savit<I>ri</I> with his razor' (MB. I, 6. 1).</p>  
<p>11.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> And fixing his thoughts on V&acirc;yu, looking at the brass vessel with warm water, (he murmurs the Mantra), 'With warm water, O V&acirc;yu, come hither' (ibid. 2).</p>  
<p>12. Drawing water (out of that vessel) with his right hand he moistens the patch of hair on the right side (of the boy's head) with (the Mantra), 'May the waters moisten thee for life' (ibid. 3).</p>  
<p>13. With (the Mantra), 'Vish<I>n</I>u's tusk art thou' (ibid. 4) he looks at the razor of Udumbara wood or at the mirror.</p>  
<p>14. With (tile Mantra), 'Herb! Protect him!' (ibid. 5) he puts seven Darbha blades, with their points turned towards (the boy's) head, into the patch of hair on the right side of his head.</p>  
<p>15. Pressing them down with his left hand, and seizing with his right hand the razor of Udumbara wood or the mirror, he touches with it (the Darbha blades), with the (Mantra), 'Axe! Do no harm to him!' (ibid. 6).</p>  
<p>16. With (the Mantra), 'With which P&ucirc;shan has shaven B<I>ri</I>haspati's head' (ibid. 7), he moves forward (that razor or the mirror) three times towards the east without cutting (the hair); once with the Ya<I>g</I>us, twice silently.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. Then (the barber) with the razor of metal cuts the hair and throws (the cut off hair ends) on the bull's dung.</p>  
<p>18. In the same way (after the same rites have been performed), he cuts the patch of hair on the back-side;</p>  
<p>19. And that on the left side.</p>  
<p>20.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> He should repeat (when going to cut the hair on the back-side, and then again on the left side, the rites stated above), beginning from the moistening of the hair (S&ucirc;tra 12).</p>  
<p>21. Grasping with his two hands (the boy) round his head he should murmur (the verse), 'The threefold age of <I>G</I>amadagni' (MB. I, 6, 8).</p>  
<p>22. In the same way (the rites are performed) for a girl,</p>  
<p>23. (But) silently.</p>  
<p>24.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_247"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> The sacrifice, however, (is performed) with the Mantra.</p>  
<p>25.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_248"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> Walking away from the fire in a northerly direction they have the arrangement of (the boy's) hair made according to the custom of his Gotra and of his family.</p>  
<p>26. They throw the hair on the bull's dung (mentioned above), take it to the forest, and bury it.</p>  
<p>27. Some throw them on a bunch (of grass or the like).</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>28. Then they may do what they like.</p>  
<p>29. A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_244"></A><A HREF="sbe30021.htm#fr_244">60:6</A> I believe that four vessels were filled, one with rice, one with barley, one with sesamum seeds, and one with beans. The Dvandva compounds vr&icirc;hiyavais and tilam&acirc;shais cannot justify the conclusion that one vessel was filled with rice and barley mixed, and another with sesamum seeds and beans, for the plural p&acirc;tr&acirc;<I>n</I>i shows that there were more than two vessels. &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana I, 17, 2, says, vr&icirc;hiyavam&acirc;shatil&acirc;n&acirc;<I>m</I> p<I>ri</I>thak p&ucirc;r<I>n</I>a<I>s</I>ar&acirc;v&acirc;<I>n</I>i.</P>
