### PA*T*ALA 3, SECTION 9.

1. <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_669.md) Now follows the distribution of
Palâ*s*a leaves (at different places).

2\. 'Protector of the house, touch them! To the protector of the house
svâhâ! Protectress of the

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

house, touch them! To the protectress of the house svâhâ! Protector of
the door, touch them! To the protector of the door svâhâ! Protectress of
the door, touch them! To the protectress of the door svâhâ!'—with (these
formulas) he puts down four leaves; (then other leaves) with (the
formulas), 'Noisy ones, touch them! To the noisy ones svâhâ! Quivered
ones. . . ye that run in the rear . . . Minglers (?) . . . Choosers . .
. Eaters, touch them! To the eaters svâhâ!'—

3\. Then again ten (leaves) with (the formula), 'Divine hosts, touch
them! To the divine hosts svâhâ!'

4\. Then other ten (leaves) with (the formula), 'Divine hosts that are
named and that are not named, touch them! To them svâhâ!'

5. <span id="fr_670"></span>[5](#fn_670.md) Then he makes a basket of
leaves, puts into it a lump of boiled rice with an 'under-spreading' (of
Â*g*ya) and sprinkling (Â*g*ya) on it, goes outside his pasture-grounds,
and hangs (the basket) up at a tree with (the formula), 'Quivered ones,
touch it! To the quivered ones svâhâ!'

6. <span id="fr_671"></span>[6](#fn_671.md) He then performs worship
(before that basket) with (the formula), 'Adoration to the quivered one,
to him who wears the quiver! To the lord of the thieves adoration!'

7. <span id="fr_672"></span>[7](#fn_672.md) With sandal salve, surâ and
water, unground, fried grains, cow-dung, with a bunch of dûrvâ grass,
with Udumbara, Palâ*s*a, Sami, Vikaṅkata, and

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A*s*vattha
(branches), and with a cow-tail he besprinkles his cows, the bull first,
with (the words), 'Bring luck! Bring luck!' Then (the bull) will bring
him luck.

8. <span id="fr_673"></span>[8](#fn_673.md) He then cooks that mess of
sacrificial food, sacred to Kshetrapati (the lord of the field), with
milk, sprinkles it (with Â*g*ya), takes it from the fire, and performs a
sacrifice to Kshetrapati on the path where his cows use to go, without a
fire, on four or on seven leaves.

9\. He has him (i.e. the Kshetrapati? an ox representing Kshetrapati?)
led (to his place) in the same way as the *s*ûlagava (chap. 8, § 2).

10. <span id="fr_674"></span>[10](#fn_674) He sacrifices quickly, (for.md)
the god has a strong digestion (?).

11\. He then performs worship with (the two verses), 'With the lord of
the field,' 'Lord of the field' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 1, 14, 2. 3).

12\. Of (the remains of that sacrificial food) sacred to Kshetrapati his
uterine relations should partake, according as the custom of their
family is.

End of the Third Pa*t*ala.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_669"></span>[222:1](sbe30081.htm#fr_669.md) 9, 1. The text has
bau*dh*yavihâra, on which the commentary observes, bau*dh*yâni
palâ*s*apar*n*âni, teshâ*m* vihâro vihara*n*a*m* nânâde*s*eshu
sthâpana*m* bau*dh*yavihâra*h*, karmanâma vâ. The bau*dh*yavihâra is, as
its description clearly shows, a ceremony for propitiating Rudra and his
hosts and for averting evil from the cattle and the fields. The
commentary understands it as forming part of the *s*ûlagava described in
chap. 8, and with this opinion it would agree very well that no
indication of the time at which the bau*dh*yavihâra ought to be
performed (such as âpûryamâ*n*apakshe pu*n*ye nakshatre) is given. Comp.
also Âpastamba VII, 20, 5 seq.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[223:5](sbe30081.htm#fr_670.md) I have translated
avadhâya (instead of avadâya), as Âpastamba VII, 20, 7 reads.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[223:6](sbe30081.htm#fr_671.md) Taittirîya
Sa*m*hitâ IV, 5, 3, 2. Of course the god to whom these designations
refer is Rudra.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[223:7](sbe30081.htm#fr_672.md) The commentary
explains surodaka as rain-water, or as rainwater which has fallen while
the sun was shining.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[224:8](sbe30081.htm#fr_673.md) Mât*ri*datta says,
kshaitrapatya*m* kshetrapatidevatâka*m* payasi sthâlîpâkam, &c. The
meaning of the expression 'that (enam) mess of sacrificial food' is
doubtful; the commentary says, enam iti pûrvâpeksham pûrvavad aupâsana
evâsyâpi *s*rapa*n*ârtham.—The last words (on four or on seven leaves)
the commentator transfers to the next Sûtra, but he mentions the
different opinion of other authorities.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[224:10](sbe30081.htm#fr_674.md) nûrtte
*s*îghra*m* ya*g*ate. kuta*h*. yata*h* sa deva*h* pâka*h*
pa*k*ana*s*îlas tîkshmas (read, tîksh*n*as) tasmât.
Mât*ri*datta.—Possibly Dr. Kirste is right in reading tûrta*m*; the
corresponding Sûtra of Âpastamba has kshipram (VII, 20, 15), and, as the
*S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a (VI, 3, 2, 2) observes, 'yad vai kshipra*m* tat
tûrtam.'
