### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 8.

1. <span id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_325.md) On the full-moon day of (the
month) Â*s*vayu*g*a, at the P*ri*shâtaka ceremony, a mess of boiled
rice-grains with milk, sacred to Rudra, (is prepared).

2\. Of that (milk-rice) let him sacrifice, the first oblation with (the
verse), 'To us, O Mitra and Varu*n*a' (Sâma-veda I, 220), the second
with (the verse), 'Not in our offspring' (*Ri*g-veda I, 114, 8),

3. <span id="fr_326"></span>[3](#fn_326) And (eight Â*g*ya oblations.md)
with the 'cow's names' (i.e. with the formulas), 'The lovely one art
thou,' &c., with each (name) separately.

4. <span id="fr_327"></span>[4](#fn_327) The rest (should be performed.md)
according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

5\. Having carried the P*ri*shâtaka around the fire, turning his right
side towards (the fire), and having caused the Brâhma*n*as to look at it
(i.e. at the P*ri*shâtaka), he should look at it himself with (the verse

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

repeated by the Brâhma*n*as and by the-sacrificer), 'That bright eye,
created by the gods, which rises on the east—may we see it a hundred
autumns; may we live a hundred autumns!'

6\. After he has entertained the Brâhma*n*as with food and has eaten
himself, (the sacrificer and his family) should tie (to their arms,
necks, &c.) amulets made of lac together with all sorts of herbs, for
the sake of prosperity.

7\. In the evening he should feed the cows with the P*ri*shâtaka, and
should let the calves join them.

8\. Thus (the cows) will thrive.

9. <span id="fr_328"></span>[9](#fn_328.md) At the sacrifice of the first
fruits a mess of boiled rice-grains with milk, sacred to Indra and Agni,
(is prepared).

10\. Having sacrificed first a Havis offering of that (milk-rice), he
sacrifices over that (oblation) four Â*g*ya oblations with (the verses),
'To him who bears a hundred weapons,' &c. (MB. II, 1, 9-12).

11. <span id="fr_329"></span>[11](#fn_329.md) The rest (should be
performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

12\. The rest of the remnants of the sacrificial food he should give to
eat to all (persons present) who have received the initiation
(Upanayana).

13\. Having 'spread under' water once, he should cut off two portions of
the boiled rice-grains.

14\. Three (portions are cut off) by descendants of Bh*ri*gu.

15\. And over (these portions) water (is poured).

16. <span id="fr_330"></span>[16](#fn_330.md) (After the food has been
prepared in this

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

way), he should swallow it without chewing it, with (the Mantra), 'From
the good to the better' (ibid. 13).

17\. In the same way three times.

18\. Silently a fourth time.

19\. After he has cut off a greater portion,

20\. They may, if they like, chew that.

21\. Having sipped water, they should touch their mouths, their heads,
and their limbs from above downwards, with (the verse), 'This art thou'
(ibid. 14).

22\. In the same way (sacrifices of the first fruits are performed) of
*S*yâmâka (panicum frumentaceum) and of barley.

23\. (At the sacrifice) of *S*yâmâka (the Mantra with which the food is
partaken of \[comp. Sûtra 16\], is), 'May Agni eat as the first' (ibid.
15).

24\. (At the sacrifice) of barley, 'This barley, mixed with honey'
(ibid. 16).
