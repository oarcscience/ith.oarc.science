(M. I, 4, I-16), one oblation with each Mantra.</p>  
<p>3.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_736"></A><A HREF="#fn_736"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> He then causes her, to the north of the fire, to tread with her right foot on a stone, with (the verse), 'Tread' (M. I, 5, 1).</p>  
<p>4. Having 'spread under' &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya into her joined hands, he pours roasted grain twice (into them), and sprinkles &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya over it.</p>  
<p>5. Some say that an uterine relation of hers pours the grain (into her hands).</p>  
<p>6.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_737"></A><A HREF="#fn_737"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> He (?) sacrifices (that grain) with (the verse), 'This wife' (M. I, 5, 2).</p>  
<p>7.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_738"></A><A HREF="#fn_738"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> Having gone round the fire, with the right side turned towards it, with the next three (verses; M. I, 5, 3-5) he makes her tread on the stone as above (M. I, 5, 6).</p>  
<p>8. And the oblation (is performed) with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 7).</p>  
<p>9. (Then follow) again the circumambulation (M. I, 5, 8-10), the injunction to tread on the stone</p>

<p>13. Having put that fire (with which the marriage rites have been performed, into a vessel), they carry it behind (the newly-married couple).</p>  
<p>14. It should be kept constantly.</p>  
<p>15. If it goes out, (a new fire) should be kindled by attrition,</p>  
<p>16. Or it should be fetched from the house of a <I>S</I>rotriya.</p>  
<p>17. Besides, if (the fire) goes out, one of them, either the wife or the husband, should fast.</p>  
<p>18. Or he may sacrifice with the next (verse; M. I, 5, 18), and not fast.</p>  
<p>19. The next (verse; M. I, 6, 1) is for putting the chariot (on which the young couple is to depart), in position;</p>  
<p>20. With the next two (verses; M. I, 6, 2. 3), he puts the two animals to the chariot;</p>  
<p>21. First the right one.</p>  
<p>22. When she mounts (the chariot), he recites over her the next (verses; M. I, 6, 4-7).</p>

<p>23. With the next (verse; M. I, 6, 8), he spreads out two threads in the wheel-tracks (in which the chariot is to go), a dark-blue one in the right (track), a red one in the left.</p>  
<p>24. With the next (verses; M. I, 6, 9-11), he walks on these (threads).</p>  
<p>25. And when they pass by bathing-places, posts, or cross-roads, let him murmur the next (verse; M. I, 6, 12).</p>
