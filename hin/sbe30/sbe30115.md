3\. On the following day he touches a cow with a Darbha blade, with the
words, 'I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_790"></span>[293:1](sbe30115.htm#fr_790) 22, 1. Comp.
above, VII, 18, 6.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[293:2](sbe30115.htm#fr_791) I believe that
*s*esha*h* means the rest of the cake. The word 'siddha*h*' possibly
refers to such preparations of the food as are indicated in Hira*n*yak.
II, 5, 14, 7. Haradatta understands *s*esha*h* as the rest of the rites
(tantrasya *s*esha*h*): 'The rest of the rites is <span id="page_294">p.
294</span> the regular one, without alterations:' it must be admitted
that the expressions used by Hira*n*yak. II, 5, 14, 10 would agree well
with this explanation.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[294:4](sbe30115.htm#fr_792) See above, V, 13,
16.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[295:18](sbe30115.htm#fr_793) See VII, 19, 11.
