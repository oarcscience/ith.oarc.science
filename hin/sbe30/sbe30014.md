### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 2.

1. <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_195.md) After the sacrifice they both
arise.

2\. The husband passes behind her back, stations himself to the south,
with his face turned to the north, and seizes the woman's joined hands.

3. <span id="fr_196"></span>[3](#fn_196) (Standing.md) to the east (of the
girl) her mother or her brother, having taken the roasted grain, should
make the bride tread on the stone with the tip of her right foot.

4\. The bridegroom murmurs: 'Tread on this stone' (MB. I, 2, 1).

5\. Her brother filling once his joined hands with roasted grain, pours
it into the bride's joined hands.

6. <span id="fr_197"></span>[6](#fn_197) After (Â*g*ya.md) has been spread
under and poured over (the fried grain), she sacrifices that in the fire
without opening her joined hands, with (the verse which the bridegroom
\[?\] recites), 'This woman says' (MB. I, 2, 2).

7. <span id="fr_198"></span>[7](#fn_198) (The verses.md), 'The god
Aryaman,' and, 'Pûshan'

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (l.l. 3. 4) (are
repeated) at the two following (oblations of fried grain).

8. <span id="fr_199"></span>[8](#fn_199.md) After that sacrifice the
husband, passing (behind her back), returns in the same way, and leads
her round the fire so that their right sides are turned towards it, or a
Brâhma*n*a versed in the Mantras (does the same), with (the verse), 'The
maid from the fathers' (MB. I, 2, 5).

9\. After she has thus been lead round, she stands as before (Sûtras 1.
2), and treads (on the stone) as before (Sûtra 3), and he murmurs the
(Mantra) as before (Sûtra 4), and (her brother) pours (the fried grain
into her hands) as before (Sûtra 5), and she sacrifices as before (Sûtra
6).

10\. In the same way three times.

11\. After (she) has poured the remnants (of the fried grain) into the
fire, they make (her) step forward in a north-easterly direction with
(the formula), 'For sap with one step' (MB. I, 2, 6. 7).

12\. She should put forward her right foot (first) and should follow
with the left.

13\. (The bridegroom) should say (to her), 'Do not put the left (foot)
before the right.'

14. <span id="fr_200"></span>[14](#fn_200.md) The lookers-on he should
address with (the verse), 'Auspicious ornaments wears this woman' (I. 1.
8).

15. <span id="fr_201"></span>[15](#fn_201.md) To the west of the fire the
water-carrier follows (their way) and besprinkles the bridegroom on his
forehead, and also the other one (i.e. the bride),

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

with this verse (which the bridegroom murmurs), 'May (the Vi*s*ve devâs)
anoint (or, unite)' (l.l. 9).

16\. After she has been (thus) besprinkled, he puts up her joined hands
with his left hand, seizes with his right hand her right hand with the
thumb, her hand being turned with the palm upwards, and murmurs these
six verses referring to the seizing of (a girl's) hand, 'I seize thy
hand' (MB. I, 2, 10-15).

17\. When (these verses) are finished, they carry her away—
