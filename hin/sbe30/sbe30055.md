### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 4, SECTION 12.

1\. They bring him a chariot, (or) a horse, or an elephant.

2. <span id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_562) 'Thou art the (Sâman called)
Rathantara; thou art the Vâmadevya; thou art the B*ri*hat;' the (verse),
'The two Aṅkas, the two Nyaṅkas' (Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ I, 7, 7, 2); (the
verse), 'May this your chariot, O A*s*vins, not suffer damage, neither
in pain nor in joy. May it make its way without damage, dispersing those
who infest us;' (and the formula), 'Here is holding, here is keeping
asunder; here is enjoyment, here may it enjoy itself:' with (these
texts) he ascends the chariot, if he enters (the village) on a chariot.

3. <span id="fr_563"></span>[3](#fn_563) 'A horse art thou, a steed art
thou'—with these eleven 'horses’ names' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. VII, 1, 12) (he
mounts) the horse, if (he intends to enter the village) on horseback.

4. <span id="fr_564"></span>[4](#fn_564) With (the formula), 'With
Indra's thunderbolt I bestride thee; carry (me); carry the time; carry
me forward to bliss. An elephant art thou. The elephant's glory art
thou. The elephant's splendour art thou. May I become endowed with the
elephant's glory, with the elephant's splendour'—(he mounts) the
elephant, if (he intends to proceed to the village) on it.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

5. <span id="fr_565"></span>[5](#fn_565) He goes to a place where they
will do honour to him.

6\. With (the verse), 'May the quarters (of the horizon) stream together
with me; may all delight assemble (here). May all wishes that are dear
to us, come near unto us; may (our) dear (wishes) stream towards us'—he
worships the quarters of the horizon.

7\. While approaching the person who is going to do honour to him, he
looks at him with (the words), 'Glory art thou; may I become glory with
thee.'

8\. Then (the host who is going to offer the Argha reception to the
Snâtaka), having prepared the dwelling-place (for his reception), says
to him, 'The Argha (will be offered)!'

9\. (The guest) replies, 'Do so!'

10. <span id="fr_566"></span>[10](#fn_566) They prepare for him (the
Madhuparka or 'honey mixture') consisting of three or of five
substances.

11\. The three substances are, curds, honey, and ghee.

12\. The five substances are, curds, honey, ghee, water, and ground
grains.

13\. Having poured curds into a brass vessel, he pours honey into it,
(and then the other substances stated above).

14. <span id="fr_567"></span>[14](#fn_567) Having poured (those
substances) into a smaller vessel, and having covered it with a larger
(cover than the vessel is), (the host) makes (the guest) accept (the
following things) separately, one after the other, viz. a bunch of grass
(to sit down on),

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

water for washing the feet, the Argha water, water for sipping, and the
honey-mixture (Madhuparka).

15. <span id="fr_568"></span>[15](#fn_568) Going after (the single
objects which are brought to the guest, the host) in a faultless, not
faltering (?) voice, announces (each of those objects to the guest).

16\. The bunch of grass (he announces by three times saying), 'The bunch
of grass!'

17. <span id="fr_569"></span>[17](#fn_569) (The guest) sits down thereon
facing the east, with (the formula), 'A giver of royal power art thou, a
teacher's seat; may I not withdraw from thee.'

18\. (The host) then utters to him the announcement, 'The water for
washing the feet!'

19. <span id="fr_570"></span>[19](#fn_570) With that (water) a *S*ûdra
or a *S*ûdra woman washes his feet; the left foot first for a
Brâhma*n*a, the right for a person of the two other castes.

Pâraskara III, 14, 3-6.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[170:3](sbe30055.htm#fr_563) In this Sûtra
three 'horses’ names' are given as the Pratîka of the Ya*g*us quoted,
'Thou art a*s*va, thou art haya, thou art maya.' Mât*ri*datta observes
that the third of them is not found in the Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ, which
gives only ten, and not eleven, horses’ names.

corrupt and the translation very doubtful. The MSS. have,

note, which is also very corrupt, runs thus: anusa*m*vra*g*inâ saha
