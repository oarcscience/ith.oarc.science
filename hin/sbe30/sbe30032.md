### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 10.

1. <span id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_339) The Ash*t*akâ (is a festival.md)
sacred to the night.

2\. It procures prosperity.

3\. It is sacred to Agni, or to the Manes, or to Pra*g*âpati, or to the
Seasons, or to the Vi*s*ve devâs—thus the deity (to which the Ash*t*akâ
is sacred), is investigated (by different teachers).

4. <span id="fr_340"></span>[4](#fn_340.md) There are four Ash*t*akâs in
(the four months of) the winter;

5\. These all he should endeavour to celebrate with (offerings of) meat;

6\. Thus says Kautsa.

7\. (There are only) three Ash*t*akâs (in the winter), says Audgâhamâni,

8\. And so say (also) Gautama and Vârkakha*nd*i.

9\. The eighth day of the dark fortnight after the Âgrahâya*n*î is
called Apûpâsh*t*akâ (i.e. Ash*t*akâ of the cakes).

10. <span id="fr_341"></span>[10](#fn_341.md) Having prepared grains in the
way prescribed

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

for Sthâlîpâkas, he cooks (those grains and prepares thus) a *k*aru.

11. <span id="fr_342"></span>[11](#fn_342) And (besides he prepares.md)
eight cakes, without turning them over in the dish (in which he bakes
them);

12\. (Each) in one dish;

13\. Without Mantras, according to Audgâhamâni;

14. <span id="fr_343"></span>[14](#fn_343) Of the size of the (cakes.md)
sacred to Tryambaka.

15\. After he has baked them, he should pour (Â*g*ya) on them, should
take them from the fire towards the north, and should pour (Â*g*ya) on
them again.

16. <span id="fr_344"></span>[16](#fn_344.md) In the way prescribed for
Sthâlîpâkas he cuts off (the prescribed portions) from the mess of
boiled grains and from the cakes, and sacrifices with (the words), 'To
the Ash*t*akâ Svâhâ!'

17. <span id="fr_345"></span>[17](#fn_345.md) The rest (should be
performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

18. <span id="fr_346"></span>[18](#fn_346) (At the second Ash*t*akâ, on.md)
the eighth day after the full-moon day of Taisha, a cow (is sacrificed).

19\. Shortly before the time of junction (of day and night, i.e. before
the morning twilight) he should place that (cow) to the east of the
fire, and when (that time) has come, he should sacrifice (Â*g*ya) with

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (the verse),
'What, O beasts, you think' (MB. II, 2, 5).

20\. And after having sacrificed, he should recite over (the cow the
verse), 'May thy mother give leave to thee' (ibid. 6).

21\. Let him sprinkle (the cow) with water in which barley is, with (the
words), 'Agreeable to the Ash*t*akâ I sprinkle thee.'

22\. Let him carry a fire-brand round it with (the verse), 'The lord of
goods, the sage (goes) round' (Sâma-veda I, 30).

23\. Let him give it water to drink.

24\. The remainder of what it has drunk he should pour out under (the
feet of) the beast with (the formula), 'Away from the gods the Havis has
been taken' (MB. II, 2, 7).

25\. They then walk in a northerly direction (from the fire) and kill
(the cow),

26\. The head of which is turned to the east, the feet to the north, if
the rite is sacred to the gods,

27\. The head to the south, the feet to the west, if the rite is sacred
to the Manes.

28\. After it has been killed, he should sacrifice (Â*g*ya) with (the
verse), 'If the beast has lowed' (ibid. 8).

29\. And (the sacrificer's) wife should get water and should wash all
the apertures of the cow's body.

30\. They lay two purifiers (i.e. grass-blades) on (the cow's body) near
its navel, cut it up in the direction of its hairs, and draw the omentum
out.

31\. He should spit it on two pieces of wood, on one (simple) branch and
on another forked branch, should besprinkle it (with water), and should
roast it.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

32. <span id="fr_347"></span>[32](#fn_347.md) When it has ceased to drop,
he should say, 'Hew the (cow) to pieces—

33\. 'So that the blood does not stain the ground to the east of the
fire.'

34\. After he has roasted (the omentum), he should pour (Â*g*ya) on it,
should take it from the fire towards the north, and should pour (Â*g*ya)
on it again.

35. <span id="fr_348"></span>[35](#fn_348.md) After he has cut off (the
prescribed portions from) the omentum in the way prescribed for
Sthâlîpâkas, or in the way prescribed for the Svish*t*ak*ri*t
(oblation), he sacrifices with (the words), 'To the Ash*t*akâ Svâhâ!'

36. <span id="fr_349"></span>[36](#fn_349.md) The rest (should be
performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite. The rest according to the
Sthâlîpâka rite.

End of the Third Prapâ*th*aka.

second after the Taishî (10, 18), and the third after the Mâghî (IV, 4,
