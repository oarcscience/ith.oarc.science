The text of the Mantra as given by Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>in is very corrupt, but the corruptions may be as old as the Hira<I>n</I>yake<I>s</I>i-s&ucirc;tra itself, or even older.</P>

The verse seems to be an adaptation of a Mantra which contained a form of the verb pari-dh&acirc; (comp. Atharva-veda XIX, 24, 2); thus the reading pari . . . dadhmasi found in the MSS. may be easily accounted for. The second hemistich is very corrupt, but the Atharva-veda (loc. cit.: yathaina<I>m</I> <I>g</I>arase nay&acirc;t) shows at least the general sense.</P>
