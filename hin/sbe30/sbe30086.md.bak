### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 5, SECTION 14.

1. <span id="fr_685"></span>[1](#fn_685.md) We shall explain (the festival
of) the Ash*t*akâ.

2\. The eighth day of the dark fortnight that follows after the full
moon of Mâgha, is called Ekâsn*t*akâ.

3\. On the day before that Ash*t*akâ, under (the Nakshatra) Anûrâdhâs,
in the afternoon he puts wood on the fire, strews southward-pointed and
eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it, and turns rice out of four
shallow cups over which he has laid one purifier, with (the Mantra), 'I
turn out, impelled by the god Savit*ri*, this cake prepared from four
cups (of rice), which may drive away all suffering from the Fathers in
the other world. On the impulse of the god Savit*ri*, with the arms of
the two A*s*vins, with Pûshan's hands I turn thee out, agreeable to the
fathers, the grandfathers, the great-grandfathers.'

4. <span id="fr_686"></span>[4](#fn_686.md) With the same purifier he
silently strains the Proksha*n*î water; he silently sprinkles (with that
water the rice and the vessels), silently husks (the rice), silently
bakes it in four dishes like a Puro*d*â*s*a, sprinkles (Â*g*ya) on it,
takes it from the fire, sprinkles (water) round (the fire) from right to
left, and puts a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire). With the (spoon
called) Darvi which is made of Udumbara wood, he cuts off in one
continual line which is directed towards south-east, (the Avadâna
portions)

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

one after the other, spreading under and sprinkling over them (Â*g*ya),
and sacrifices them, one after the other, in one continual line which is
directed towards south-east, with (the Mantras), 'The mortars, the
pressing-stones have made their noise, preparing the annual offering.
Ekâsh*t*akâ! May we be rich in offspring, in valiant sons, the lords of
wealth. Svadhâ! Adoration!

'God Agni! The cake which is prepared with ghee and accompanied by (the
word) svadhâ, that the Fathers may satiate themselves—(this our)
offering carry duly, Agni. I, the son, sacrifice an oblation to my
fathers. Svadhâ! Adoration!

'Here is a cake, Agni, prepared from four cups (of rice), with ghee,
rich in milk, in wealth, in prosperity. May the Fathers gladly accept it
all together; may it be well sacrificed and well offered by me. Svadhâ!
Adoration!'

5\. Then he makes oblations of (other) food with (the verses), 'The one
who shone forth as the first,' 'The Ekâsh*t*akâ, devoting herself to
austerities,' 'She who shone forth as the first' (Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ IV,
3, 11, I. 3. 5).

6\. Cutting off (the Avadânas destined for the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation)
together from the cake and from the (other) food and mixing them with
clarified butter, he makes an oblation thereof with (the formula), 'To
Agni Kavyavâhana Svish*t*ak*ri*t svadhâ! Adoration!'

7. <span id="fr_687"></span>[7](#fn_687) That (cake.md) with ghee and honey
and with the food (mentioned in Sûtras 5. 6) he touches in the way
prescribed for the *S*râddha ceremony and puts

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

down lumps (of it) according to the ritual of the Pi*nd*a offerings.

8\. (The remains of) that (cake, &c.) he serves to learned Brâhma*n*as.

9\. He gives them food and presents as at the *S*râddha ceremony.

10. <span id="fr_688"></span>[10](#fn_688) The known (rites.md) down to the
pouring out of the handfuls of water (are performed here) as at the
monthly (*S*râddha).
