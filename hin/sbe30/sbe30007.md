### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 4.

1. <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126) He then should silently offer
the Balis.

2\. Let him speak only what refers to the due preparation of the food.
With guests he may converse, if he likes.

3\. He then should take some portion of food which is fit for sacrifice,
should pour over it some liquid fit for sacrifice (such as ghee, milk,
or curds), and should sacrifice it silently in the fire with his hand.

4\. The first oblation is sacred to Pra*g*âpati, the second to (Agni)
Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

5\. He then should offer the Balis, inside or outside (the Agnyagâra),
having well cleansed the ground.

6\. Let him pour out water once, and put down Balis in four places, and
finally sprinkle once (water on the four Balis).

7\. Or let him for each Bali which he puts down, sprinkle (water) before
and afterwards.

8\. What he puts down first, that is the Bali belonging to the Earth.
What in the second place, to Vâyu. What in the third place, to the
Vi*s*ve devâs. What in the fourth place, to Pra*g*âpati.

9. <span id="fr_127"></span>[9](#fn_127) Then he should offer other
Balis (near) the water-pot, the middle (post, and) the door: the first
Bali is sacred to the Waters, the second to the Herbs and Trees, the
third to the Ether.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

10\. Then he should offer another Bali in the bed or in the privy. That
Bali belongs either to Kâma or to Manyu.

11. <span id="fr_128"></span>[11](#fn_128) Then (another Bali) on the
heap of sweepings; that (belongs) to the hosts of Rakshas.

12\. The remnants of the Balis he should besprinkle with water, and
should pour them out towards the south from right to left; they belong
to the Fathers.

13\. Let him sacrifice in the fire sitting.

14\. Let him make the oblation to the Fathers sitting; the other (Balis
he may offer) as it happens.

15\. He should, however, offer those Balis himself as long as he stays
at home.

16\. Or another person who must be a Brâhma*n*a (should offer them for
him).

17\. Both the husband and his wife (should offer them):

18\. This is the rule for householders.

19. <span id="fr_129"></span>[19](#fn_129) The wife in the evening, the
man in the morning: thus (it is stated).

20\. He should offer such Balis of all food whatever, be it prepared for
the Fathers, or for auspicious

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

purposes (for instance, for being offered to Brâhma*n*as), or for
(ordinary) purposes.

21\. Only in the case of a sacrifice (this rule) ceases.

22. <span id="fr_130"></span>[22](#fn_130) If rice and barley are
prepared for one and the same meal, he should, having offered (Balis) of
the one or the other (kind of food), consider his duty as fulfilled.

23. <span id="fr_131"></span>[23](#fn_131) If the food is cooked at
different times for one meal, he should perform this Bali ceremony only
once.

24\. If food is prepared at different places for one family, he should
perform this Bali ceremony only from (the food which is prepared in) the
kitchen belonging to the householder.

25\. However (of the persons belonging to the family) he whose food
becomes ready before (that of the householder), (that person) should
offer the prescribed portion in the fire, and give to a Brâhma*n*a his
share (of the food), and then should eat himself.

26\. He whose (food becomes ready) after (that of the householder),
should only eat.

27\. Here they say also:

28\. 'At the end of that offering of Balis let him pronounce a wish.
Then it will be fulfilled to him.'

29. <span id="fr_132"></span>[29](#fn_132) He himself, however, should
offer the Âsasya Bali, from the barley(-harvest) till the
rice(-harvest), and from the rice(-harvest) till the barley(-harvest).
This is called the Âsasya Bali.

This Bali is called â-sasya, because it is offered until (â) the next
crop (sasya) is ripe. As to the regulation that the sacrificer has to
offer it himself, compare above, Sûtras 15-19.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

30\. Thus he obtains long life.

31. <span id="fr_133"></span>[31](#fn_133) When a donation has been
made, he should offer a Bali of chaff, of the scum of boiled rice, and
of water. This is sacred to Rudra. This is sacred to Rudra.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_126"></span>[22:1](sbe30007.htm#fr_126) 4, 1 seqq. The
daily Bali offering. Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 5, 20 seqq.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[22:9](sbe30007.htm#fr_127) According to the
commentary the first of these three Balis has <span id="page_23">p.
23</span> to be offered near the water-pot, the second near the middle
door of the house, the third (comp. Gautama V, 16) in the air. With the
genitives the word samîpe is supplied. It is difficult to understand why
the author, if his intention had been to state three places in which the
Balis had to be offered, should have mentioned only two. Thus I believe
that the right explanation is that-of Professor Knauer, who takes
madhyama in the sense of the middle post of the house (comp. III, 3,
31).

<span id="fn_128"></span>[23:11](sbe30007.htm#fr_128) The commentary
explains avasalavi nere, as is frequently the case, by pit*ri*tîrthena.
I agree with the opinion pronounced in the Petersburg Dictionary, in
rejecting this explanation.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[23:19](sbe30007.htm#fr_129) Comp. Manu III,
121.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[24:22](sbe30007.htm#fr_130) Kâla I take, as
the commentator does, for bho*g*anakâla.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[24:23](sbe30007.htm#fr_131) Here again kâla
occurs in the same sense. Comp. Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 5, 34.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[24:29](sbe30007.htm#fr_132) Khâdira-G*ri*hya
I, 5, 37. The barley-harvest is in the hot season, the rice-harvest in
autumn (see Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, 243). The sacrificer offers
barley from the barley-harvest till the rice-harvest; and rice from the
rice-harvest till the barley-harvest. \[fp. 25

<span id="fn_133"></span>[25:31](sbe30007.htm#fr_133) Khâdira-G*ri*hya
I, 5, 30. The repetition of the last words makes it probable that this
Sûtra was at one time considered the end of the first book. Comp.
Introduction, p. 11.
