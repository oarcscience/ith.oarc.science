### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 3.

1. <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_283) On the full-moon day of
Praush*th*apada (or) under (the Nakshatra) Hasta the Upâkara*n*a (or
opening ceremony of the annual term of Veda-study, is performed).

2. <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_284) After (the teacher) has
sacrificed with the Vyâh*ri*tis, he recites the Sâvitrî to the students
as at the Upanayana;

3\. And (he chants) the Sâvitrî with its Sâman melody,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

4\. And (the Bârhaspatya Sâman, with the text), 'Soma, the king,
Varu*n*a' (Sâma-veda I, 91).

5. <span id="fr_285"></span>[5](#fn_285) After they have recited (the
first verses) of the *Kh*andas book, from its beginning, they may do
what they like.

6. <span id="fr_286"></span>[6](#fn_286) They eat fried barley-grains
with (the verse), 'That which is accompanied by grains and by a karambha
(i.e. curds with flour)' (Sâma-veda I, 2 10).

7\. They partake of curds with (the verse), 'I have praised Dadhikrâvan'
(Sâma-veda I, 358).

8. <span id="fr_287"></span>[8](#fn_287) After they have sipped water,
(the teacher) should cause them to repeat the first (?) verses, and to
sing the first (?) Sâmans, of the different sections (?).

9. <span id="fr_288"></span>[9](#fn_288) On the day sacred to Savit*ri*
they wait.

10. <span id="fr_289"></span>[10](#fn_289) And at (the beginning of) the
northerly

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

course of the sun (they wait) one night with one day before and one day
after it,

11\. (Or they interrupt their study for) a period of three nights before
and afterwards, according to some (teachers).

12. <span id="fr_290"></span>[12](#fn_290) And both times water
libations are offered to the Â*k*âryas.

13. <span id="fr_291"></span>[13](#fn_291) Some perform the Upâkara*n*a
on the full-moon day of *S*râva*n*a and wait (with studying) the time
(from that day) till the day sacred to Savit*ri* (Sûtra 9).

14. <span id="fr_292"></span>[14](#fn_292) On the full-moon day of
Taisha they leave off (studying the Veda).

15. <span id="fr_293"></span>[15](#fn_293) They should go out of the
village in an easterly or northerly direction, should go to water which
reaches higher than to their secret parts, should touch water (in the
way prescribed above, I, 2), and should satiate the metres, the
*Ri*shis, and teachers (by libations of water).

16. <span id="fr_294"></span>[16](#fn_294) After this second
Upâkara*n*a, until the (chief) Upâkara*n*a (has been performed) again
for the Vedic texts, an interruption of the study (of the Veda takes
place), if clouds rise.

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

17\. If lightning (is observed), or if it thunders, or if it is
drizzling, (he shall not study) until the same time next day.

18. <span id="fr_295"></span>[18](#fn_295) On the falling of a meteor,
or after an earthquake, or an eclipse of the sun or of the moon (the
study is interrupted until the same time next day),

19\. And if a whirlwind occurs.

20\. Let them not study on the Ash*t*akâ days, and on the days of the
new moon,

21\. And on the days of the full moon—

22. <span id="fr_296"></span>[22](#fn_296) In the three months Kârttika,
Phâlguna, and Âshâ*dh*a.

23\. And (the study is interrupted) for one day and one night,

24\. If a fellow-pupil has died,

25\. Or the sovereign of his country;

26\. Three days, if his teacher (has died);

27\. One day and one night, if somebody (has died) who has reverentially
approached.

28\. If singing, or the sound of a musical instrument, or weeping is
heard, or if it is storming, (the

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

study of the Veda is discontinued) as long as that (reason of the
interruption) lasts.

29. <span id="fr_297"></span>[29](#fn_297) As regards other (cases in
which the reading of the Veda should ne discontinued), the practice of
the *S*ish*t*as (should be followed).

30. <span id="fr_298"></span>[30](#fn_298) In the case of a prodigy an
expiation (has to be performed) by the householder (or) by his wife.

31\. If a spar of the roof or the middle (post of the house) breaks, or
if the water-barrel bursts, let him sacrifice (Â*g*ya oblations) with
the Vyâh*ri*tis.

32\. If he has seen bad dreams, let him murmur this verse, 'To-day, O
god Savit*ri*' (Sâma-veda I, 141).

33\. Now (follows) another (expiation).

34. <span id="fr_299"></span>[34](#fn_299) If he has touched a piled-up
(fire-altar) or a sacrificial post, or if he has humming in his ears, or
if his eye palpitates, or if the sun rises or sets while he is sleeping,
or if his organs of sense have been defiled by something bad, let him
sacrifice two Â*g*ya oblations with the two verses, 'May my strength
return to me' (Mantra-Brâhma*n*a I, 6, 33. 34).

35\. Or (let him sacrifice) two pieces of wood anointed with Â*g*ya.

36\. Or let him murmur (those two verses) at light offences.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_283"></span>[77:1](sbe30025.htm#fr_283) 3, 1 seq. The
Upâkara*n*a ceremony; Khâdira-G*ri*hya III, 2, 16 seq. Regarding the
different terms for this ceremony, comp. *S*âṅkhâyana IV, 5, 2;
Â*s*valâyana III, 5, 3; Pâraskara II, 10, 2. Hira*n*yake*s*in says:
*s*rava*n*âpaksha oshadhîshu *g*âtâsu hastena paur*n*amâsyâ*m*
vâdhyâyopâkarma.—It seems impossible to me to adopt an explanation of
this Sûtra, which gives to praush*th*apadî another meaning than that
based on the constant use of these feminines derived from the names of
Nakshatras, i.e. the day of the full moon which falls under such or such
a Nakshatra. Hasten a, therefore, necessarily refers to another day
besides the Praush*th*apadî, on which the Upâkara*n*a may be celebrated.
Perhaps we may conjecture, praush*th*apadî*m* hastena vopâkara*n*am.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[77:2](sbe30025.htm#fr_284) Comp. above, II,
10, 39.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[78:5](sbe30025.htm#fr_285) The *Kh*andas book
is the first Sâmavedâr*k*ika in which the verses are arranged according
to their metre.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[78:6](sbe30025.htm#fr_286) It is not quite
clear from the text, in what connection the rites described in Sûtras
6-8 stand with those treated of in the preceding Sûtras. The expression
yathârtham used in Sûtra 5 ('yathârtham iti karma*n*a*h* parisamâptir
u*k*yate,' Comm.; comp. above, I, 3, 12 note) clearly indicates the
close of the ceremony; on the other hand the comparison of Pâraskara II,
10, 15 seq., *S*âṅkhâyana IV, 5, 10 seq., Â*s*valâyana III, 5, 10, seems
to show that the acts stated in Sûtras 6-8 form part of the ceremony
described before.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[78:8](sbe30025.htm#fr_287) I do not try to
translate this very obscure Sûtra according to the commentary, in which
khâ*nd*ika is explained as 'the number (of pupils).' Perhaps the word is
a misspelling for ka*nd*ikâ or the like, and means sections of the
texts. Comp. Khâdira-G*ri*hya III, 2, 23. The construction
(â*k*ântodakâ*h* . . . kârayet) is quite irregular.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[78:9](sbe30025.htm#fr_288) I.e. they do not
continue their study. The day sacred to Savit*ri* is the day under the
constellation of Hasta, mentioned in Sûtra 1, for Savit*ri* is the
presiding deity over that Nakshatra (comp. *S*âṅkhâyana I, 26, 11).

<span id="fn_289"></span>[78:10](sbe30025.htm#fr_289) Comp. the note on
Sûtra 16.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[79:12](sbe30025.htm#fr_290) Regarding the
Tarpa*n*a ceremony comp. *S*âṅkhâyana 1V, 9, s note. From the word 'and'
the commentator concludes that the libations are offered not only to the
Â*k*âryas, but also to the *Ri*shis, &c. (Sûtra 15).

<span id="fn_291"></span>[79:13](sbe30025.htm#fr_291) Comp. Gautama XVI,
1; Vasish*th*a XIII, 1; Âpastamba I, 9, 1, &c.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[79:14](sbe30025.htm#fr_292) Âpastamba I, 9, 2,
&c.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[79:15](sbe30025.htm#fr_293) This is a
description of the Utsarga ceremony; comp. *S*âṅkhâyana IV, 6, 6;
Â*s*valâyana III, 5, 21-23; Pâraskara II, 12.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[79:16](sbe30025.htm#fr_294) The most natural
way of interpreting the text would be, in my opinion, to assume that the
'second Upâkara*n*a' (pratyupâkara*n*a) is identical with the Utsarga.
The second Upâkara*n*a thus would in the same time conclude the first
term for studying the <span id="page_80">p. 80</span> Veda, and open a
second term. The distinction of two such periods, which may be called
two terms, is frequently met with in other texts, for instance, in
Vasish*th*a XIII, 5-7 (S.B.E. XIV, 63); Manu IV, 98. According to the
commentary, on the other hand, the second Upâkara*n*a is performed at
the beginning of the northerly course of the sun (comp. Sûtras 10-12);
it is stated that after that ceremony the Uttara (i.e. the
Uttarâr*k*ika?) and the Rahasya texts are studied. It deserves to be
noticed that Manu (IV, 96) prescribes the performing of the Utsarga
either under the Nakshatra Pushya (i.e. Tishya), or on the first day of
the bright fortnight of Mâgha, which is considered as coinciding, at
least approximately, with the beginning of the northerly course of the
sun.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[80:18](sbe30025.htm#fr_295) Comp. Manu IV,
105.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[80:22](sbe30025.htm#fr_296) These are the days
of the ancient Vedic *k*âturmâsya sacrifices.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[81:29](sbe30025.htm#fr_297) The definition of
a *S*ish*t*a, or instructed person, is given in Baudhâyana I, 1, 6
(S.B.E. XIV, 143).

<span id="fn_298"></span>[81:30](sbe30025.htm#fr_298) 30-36. Different
expiations; comp. Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 5, 35-37.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[81:34](sbe30025.htm#fr_299) *K*itya means
*K*itya agni, the piled-up fire-altar, the construction of which is
treated of, for instance, in the *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a VI-X. Prof.
Weber has devoted to the rites connected with the *k*itya agni a very
detailed paper, Indische Studien, XIII, 217 seq. That *k*itya does not
mean here anything different from *k*itya agni is shown by the
Mânava-G*ri*hya I, 3: yadi . . . akshi vâ spandet kar*n*o vâ kro*s*ed
agni*m* vâ *k*ityam ârohet *s*ma*s*âna*m* vâ ga*kkh*ed yûpa*m*
vopasp*ris*et, &c.
