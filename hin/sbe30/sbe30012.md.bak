### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 9.

1. <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_171.md) He then should take away the
remnants of the Havis in a northern direction, should take them out (of
the vessel in which they are), and should give them to the Brahman.

2\. He should try to satiate him.

3\. They say indeed with regard to sacrifice: 'Through the Brâhma*n*a's
being satiated (with sacrificial food) I become satiated myself.'

4\. Then (he should give to the Brahman) what other food has just become
ready.

5\. Then he should try to gain the favour of Brâhma*n*as by (gifts of)
food.

6. <span id="fr_172"></span>[6](#fn_172.md) A full vessel constitutes the
fee for the sacrifice; that he should give to the Brahman.

7\. A brazen vessel or a wooden cup which has been filled with food,
with prepared food or with raw food, or even only with fruits: this they
call a full vessel.

8. <span id="fr_173"></span>[8](#fn_173.md) The Brahman is the only
officiating priest at the Pâkaya*gñ*as.

9\. (The sacrificer) himself is Hot*ri*.

10\. A full vessel (see Sûtra 7) is the lowest sacrificial fee at a
Pâkaya*gñ*a.

11\. The highest is unlimited.

12. <span id="fr_174"></span>[12](#fn_174.md) Thus Sudâs Pai*g*avana, after
having offered the sacrifice of a mess of cooked food to Indra and

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni, gave one
hundred thousand (cows as the sacrificial fee).

13\. Now if he should not be able to get for the morning or for the
evening oblation, or for the sacrifices of the full or of the new moon
at his (sacred) domestic fire, any substance fit for sacrifice or a
person who could sacrifice (instead of himself, if he is prevented):
what ought he to do?

14. <span id="fr_175"></span>[14](#fn_175.md) Until the evening oblation
the (time for the) morning oblation is not elapsed, nor the (time for
the) evening oblation until the morning oblation. Until the new moon the
(time for the) sacrifice of the full moon is not elapsed, nor the (time
for the) sacrifice of the new moon until the full moon.

15\. During that interval he should try to obtain sacrificial food or to
find a sacrificer.

16. <span id="fr_176"></span>[16](#fn_176.md) Or (if he does not succeed in
this) he should cook fruits or leaves of trees or herbs which are
sacrificially pure, and should sacrifice them.

17\. Or he should at least sacrifice water; thus has said Pâkaya*gñ*a,
the son of I*d*â. For (even if he offers only water) the sacrifice has
been performed.

18. <span id="fr_177"></span>[18](#fn_177.md) And there is an expiation for
one who has not sacrificed.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

19\. And, (says Pâkaya*gñ*a,) a Brâhma*n*a should not omit to keep his
vow.

20\. Here they say also:

21\. He should keep (his vow) during that time in which he does not
sacrifice, by abstaining from food.

22. <span id="fr_178"></span>[22](#fn_178.md) When he then has obtained
(the necessary substances for sacrificing), he should make up for the
(omitted) oblations.

23\. For thus also his vow has been duly kept.

24. <span id="fr_179"></span>[24](#fn_179.md) These rules (which have been
given with regard to the sacrifices of the full and new moon) are valid
for the Havis oblations which will be stated hereafter.

25. <span id="fr_180"></span>[25](#fn_180.md) After the end of the Mantra
follows the word Svâhâ.

26. <span id="fr_181"></span>[26](#fn_181.md) At Â*g*ya oblations he should
only prepare that Â*g*ya (chap. 7, 28) and should sacrifice it, picking
out portions of it. (He should) not (sacrifice) the two Â*g*ya portions
nor the Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

27. <span id="fr_182"></span>[27](#fn_182.md) At Â*g*ya oblations he
should, if no special rule is given, sacrifice with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis
before and after (the chief ceremonies).

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

28. <span id="fr_183"></span>[28](#fn_183.md) As at the wedding, thus at
the tonsure (of the child's head), the initiation (of the
Brahma*k*ârin), and at the cutting of the beard.

29. <span id="fr_184"></span>[29](#fn_184.md) At the end of the ceremony
the Vâmadevya is sung for the sake of averting evil. The Vâmadevya is
sung for the sake of averting evil.

End of the First Prapâ*th*aka.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[38:8](sbe30012.htm#fr_173.md) 8, 9. The native
authorities divide these two Sûtras after *ri*tvik; I propose to divide
after pâkaya*gñ*eshu.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[38:12](sbe30012.htm#fr_174.md) The commentary
here refers to the rule of the Drâhyâya*n*a-sûtra (= Lâ*t*yâyana VIII,
I, 2): sa*m*khyâmâtre *k*a dakshi*n*â gâva*h*.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[39:16](sbe30012.htm#fr_176.md) 16 seqq.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 2, 10 seqq. In this teacher Pâkaya*gñ*a, son of
I*d*â, whose opinion on the performance of certain Pâkaya*gñ*as is here
stated, we have of course to see a fictitious sage of the same kind with
the well-known *Ri*shi Pragâtha, to whom the authorship of a number of
Sûktas in the Pragâtha book (*Ri*g-veda, Ma*nd*ala VIII) is ascribed.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[39:18](sbe30012.htm#fr_177.md) 18, 19. By the
repetition of iti these Sûtras seem to be characterised as continuing
the statement of Pâkaya*gñ*a's opinion; comp. Dr. Knauer's Introduction,
p. xviii. As to Sûtra 18, comp. *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 3, 9.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[40:22](sbe30012.htm#fr_178.md) 'He should count
the omitted (oblations), should pour the corresponding number of
oblations into his vessel, and should sacrifice them in the due way all
at once with one Mantra. In the same way also the other oblations
(belonging to other gods).' Karmapradîpa.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[40:24](sbe30012.htm#fr_179.md) Is Havis here used
as opposed to Â*g*ya (Sûtra 26), in the same way in which Kâtyâyana says
(*S*raut. I, 9, 1. 20): 'vrîhîn yavân vâ havishi; ubhayata â*g*ya*m*
havisha*h*'? Comp. below, III, 8, 10; Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 10, 26.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[40:26](sbe30012.htm#fr_181.md) As to upaghâtam,
comp. the note on chap. 8, 2.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[40:27](sbe30012.htm#fr_182.md)
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 12, 13; Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 3, 12-13, where the
traditional division of the Sûtras differs from that which is supported
by tradition in the text of Gobhila. Gobhila has used <span
id="page_41">p. 41</span> the word â*g*yâhutishu in the beginning of
Sûtra 26, and it would have been superfluous if he had repeated it in
connection with the words nâ*g*yabhâgau na svish*t*ak*ri*t. In the
corresponding Sûtras of the Khâdira the case was different, and there
the words nâ*g*yabhâgau na svish*t*ak*ri*t inevitably required the
addition of a word like â*g*yâhutishu, by which to show which class of
sacrifices it was which required no Â*g*yabhâgas and no Svish*t*ak*ri*t.
The following word in the Khâdira text, however, anâde*s*e, should be
referred, against tradition, to Sûtra 13, as is shown by the comparison
of *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 12, 13.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[41:28](sbe30012.htm#fr_183.md) At the wedding,
oblations are made first with the three single Mahâvyâh*ri*tis,
afterwards with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis together; see below, II, 1, 25. 26.
The tonsure of the child's head is treated of below, II, 9; the
initiation (upanayana), II, 10; the cutting of the beard, III, 1. Comp.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya, I, 3, 10.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[41:29](sbe30012.htm#fr_184.md) Apav*ri*tte
karma*n*i should be corrected into apav*ri*kte karma*n*i, as has been
noticed in the Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. apa-vart. The
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 2, 1 says karmâpavarge.
