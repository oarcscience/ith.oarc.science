### PA*T*ALA 4, SECTION 12.

1\. While they are eating, he looks at them with (the words), 'My soul
(âtman) dwells in the Brahman that it may be immortal.'

When they have eaten (and go away), he goes after them and asks for
their permission to take the remains of their meal (for the rites which
he is going

to perform). Then he takes a water-pot and a handful of Darbha grass,
goes forth to a place that lies in a south-easterly intermediate
direction, spreads the Darbha grass out with its points towards the
south, and pours out on that (grass) with downward-turned hands, ending
in the south, three handfuls of water, with (the formulas), 'May the
fathers, the friends of Soma, wipe themselves! May the grandfathers . .
. the great-grandfathers, the friends of Soma, wipe themselves!' or,
'N.N.! Wash thyself! N.N.! Wash thyself!'

3. <span id="fr_681"></span>[3](#fn_681) On that (grass) he puts down,
with downward-turned hands, ending in the south, the lumps (of food for
the Fathers). To his father he gives his lump with (the words), 'This to
thee, father, N.N.!' to the grandfather with (the words), 'This to thee,
grandfather, N.N.!' to the great-grandfather with (the words), 'This to
thee, great-grandfather, N.N.!' silently a fourth (lump). This (fourth
lump) is optional.

4\. Should he not know the names (of the ancestors), he gives the lump
to the father with (the words), 'Svadhâ to the Fathers who dwell on the
earth,' to the grandfather with (the words), 'Svadhâ to the Fathers who
dwell in the air,' to the great-grandfather with (the words), 'Svadhâ to
the Fathers who dwell in heaven.'

5\. Then he gives, corresponding to each lump, collyrium and (other)
salve and (something that represents) a garment.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

6. <span id="fr_682"></span>[6](#fn_682) The collyrium (he gives),
saying three times, 'Anoint thy eyes, N.N.! Anoint thy eyes, N.N.!'

7\. The salve, saying three times, 'Anoint thyself, N.N.! Anoint
thyself, N.N.!'

8. <span id="fr_683"></span>[8](#fn_683) With (the formula), 'These
garments are for you, O Fathers. Do not seize upon anything else that is
ours,' he tears off a skirt (of his garment) or a flake of wool and puts
that down (for the Fathers), if he is in the first half of his life.

9\. He tears out some hairs of his body, if in the second half.

10\. Then he washes the vessel (in which the food was of which he had
offered the lumps), and sprinkles (the water with which he has washed
it), from right to left round (the lumps) with (the Mantra), 'These
honey-sweet waters, bringing refreshment to children and grandchildren,
giving sweet drink and ambrosia to the Fathers, the divine waters
refresh both (the living and the dead), these rivers, abounding in
water, covered with reeds, with beautiful bathing-places; may they flow
up to you in yon world!' Then he turns the vessel over, crosses his
hands so that the left hand becomes right and the right hand becomes
left, and worships (the Fathers) with the formulas of adoration,
'Adoration to you, O Fathers, for the sake of sap' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. III,
2, 5, 5).

11\. Then he goes to the brink of some water and pours down three
handfuls of water (with the following Mantras):
