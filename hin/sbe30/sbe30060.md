*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 5, SECTION 17.

1\. A she-wolf (he addresses) with (the verse), 'Whether incited by
others or whether on its own accord the Bhaye*d*aka (? Bhayo*d*aka, var.
lect.) utters this cry, may Indra and Agni, united with Brahman, render
it blissful to us in our house.'

2. <span id="fr_602"></span>[2](#fn_602) A bird (he addresses) with (the
verse), 'Thou fliest, stretching out thy legs; the left eye . . .; may
nothing here suffer harm (through thee);'

3\. An owl (piṅgalâ) with (the verse), 'The bird with the golden wings
flies to the abode of the gods. Flying round the village from left to
right portend us luck by thy cry, O owl!'

4. <span id="fr_603"></span>[4](#fn_603) 'May my faculties return into
me; may life return, prosperity return; may the divine power return into
me; may my goods return to me.

'And may these fires that are stationed on the (altars called)
Dhish*n*yâs, be in good order here, each in its right place. Svâhâ!

'My self has returned, life has returned to me; breath has returned,
design has returned to me. (Agni) Vai*s*vânara, grown strong with his
rays, may he dwell in my mind, the standard of immortality. Svâhâ!

'The food which is eaten in the evening, that does

not satiate in the morning him whom hunger assails. May all that (which
we have seen in our dreams), do no harm to us, for it has not been seen
by day. To Day svâhâ!'—with these (verses) he sacrifices sesamum seeds
mixed with Â*g*ya, if he has seen a bad dream.

5. <span id="fr_604"></span>[5](#fn_604) Now the following expiations
for portents are prescribed. A dove sits down on the hearth, or the bees
make honey in his house, or a cow (that is not a calf) sucks another
cow, or a post puts forth shoots, or an anthill has arisen (in his
house): cases like these (require the following expiation):

6. <span id="fr_605"></span>[6](#fn_605) He should bathe in the morning,
should put on clean garments, should show patience (with everybody)
during the day, and should speak (only) with Brâhma*n*as. Having put
wood on the fire in an inner apartment, and having performed the rites
down to the Vyâh*ri*ti oblations, he sacrifices with (the verses),
'This, O Varu*n*a,' &c. (see above I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the
Sûtra). Then he serves food to the Brâhma*n*as and causes them to say,
'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_602"></span>[183:2](sbe30060.htm#fr_602) 17, 2. The
commentary explains *s*akuni (bird) by dhvâṅksha (crow). In the
translation of the Mantra (Taitt. Âr. IV, 35) I have left out the
unintelligible words nipepi *k*a. The way to correct the last Pâda is
shown by Atharva-veda VI, 57, 3; X, 5, 23.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[183:4](sbe30060.htm#fr_603) Comp.
Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya III, 6, 8.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[184:5](sbe30060.htm#fr_604) *S*âṅkhâyana V, 5.
8. 11; Â*s*valâyana III, 7, &c. Kuptvâ is corrupt; we should expect a
locative. We ought to correct kuptvâm, as Dr. Kirste has observed, comp.
Âpastamba-G*ri*hya VIII, 23, 9.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[184:6](sbe30060.htm#fr_605) Comp. above, I, 4,
14, 2; 15, 5; I, 2, 8, 16; I, 3, 9, 7. 8.
