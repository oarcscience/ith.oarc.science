### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 3, SECTION 8.

1. <span id="fr_667"></span>[1](#fn_667) Now (follows.md) the sacrifice of
the *s*ûlagava (or spit-ox, for propitiating Rudra and averting plague
in cattle).

2\. In the fortnight of the increasing moon, under an auspicious
constellation, he puts wood on the fire, strews (Darbha grass) on the
entire surface around the fire, cooks a mess of sacrificial food with
milk,

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

sprinkles it (with Â*g*ya), takes it from the fire, builds two huts to
the west of the fire, and has the spit-ox led to the southerly (hut)
with (the verse), 'May the fallow steeds, the harmonious ones, bring
thee hither, together with the white horses, the bright, wind-swift,
strong ones, that are as quick as thought. Come quickly to my offering,
*S*arva! Om!'

3. <span id="fr_668"></span>[3](#fn_668) To the northerly (hut he has.md)
the 'bountiful one' (led);—(i.e. the consort of the spit-ox);

4\. To the middle (between the two huts) the 'conqueror' (i.e. a calf of
those two parents).

5\. He gives them water to drink in the same order in which they have
been led (to their places), prepares three messes of boiled rice,
'spreading under' and sprinkling (Â*g*ya) on them, and touches (the
three beasts with those portions of rice) in the order in which they
have been led (to their places), with (the Mantras), 'May he, the
bountiful one, touch it. To the bountiful one svâhâ! May she, the
bountiful one, touch it. To the bountiful one svâhâ! May the conqueror
touch it. To the conqueror svâhâ!'

6\. After he has performed (the rites) down to the Vyâh*ri*ti oblations,
he takes the messes of boiled rice (to the fire) and sacrifices them
(the first with the Mantra),

'To the god Bhava svâhâ! To the god Rudra svâhâ! To the god *S*arva
svâhâ! To the god Î*s*âna . . . Pa*s*upati . . . Ugra . . . Bhîma svâhâ!
To the great god svâhâ!'

7\. Then he sacrifices the consort's rice to the consort (of Rudra, with
the Mantra), 'To the consort

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

of the god Bhava svâhâ! To the consort of the god Rudra . . . *S*arva .
. . Î*s*âna . . . Pa*s*upati . . . Ugra . . . Bhîma . . . of he great
god svâhâ!'

8\. Then he sacrifices of the middle portion of rice with (the Mantra),
'To the conqueror svâhâ! To the conqueror svâhâ!'

9\. Then he cuts off from all the three portions of rice and sacrifices
the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation with (the Mantra), 'To Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t
svâhâ!'

10\. Around that fire they place their cows so that they can smell the
smell of that sacrifice.

11\. 'With luck may they walk round our full face'—with (these words) he
walks round all (the objects mentioned, viz. the fire, the three beasts,
and the other cows), so as to turn his right side towards them, and
worships (the *s*ûlagava) with the (eleven) Anuvâkas, 'Adoration to
thee, Rudra, to the wrath' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 5), or with the first and
last of them.
