Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 7.

1. <span id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_422.md) Let him select the site for
building his house—

2\. On even ground, which is covered with grass, which cannot be
destroyed (by inundations, &c.),

3\. On which the waters flow off to the east or to the north,

4\. On which plants grow which have no milky juice or thorns, and which
are not acrid.

5\. The earth should be white, if he is a Brâhma*n*a,

6\. Red, if he is a Kshatriya,

7\. Black, if he is a Vai*s*ya.

8\. (The soil should be) compact, one-coloured, not dry, not salinous,
not surrounded by sandy desert, not swampy.

9\. (Soil) on which Darbha grass grows, (should be chosen) by one who is
desirous of holy lustre,

10\. (Soil covered) with big sorts of grass, by one who is desirous of
strength,

11\. (Soil covered) with tender grass, by one who is desirous of cattle.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

12\. (The site of the house) should have the form of a brick,

13\. Or it should have the form of a round island.

14\. Or there should be natural holes (in the ground) in all directions.

15\. On such (ground) one who is desirous of fame or strength, should
build his house with its door to the east;

16\. One who is desirous of children or of cattle, (should build it)
with its door to the north;

17\. One who is desirous of all (those things), (should build it) with
its door to the south.

18\. Let him not build it with its door to the west.

19. <span id="fr_423"></span>[19](#fn_423.md) And a back-door.

20\. The house-door.

21\. So that (he?) may not be exposed to looks (?).

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

22. <span id="fr_424"></span>[22](#fn_424.md) 'Let him avoid an A*s*vattha
tree on the east-side (of his house), and a Plaksha on the south-side, a
Nyagrodha on the west-side, and on the north-side an Udumbara.

23\. 'One should say that an A*s*vattha brings (to the house) danger
from fire; one should say that a Plaksha tree brings early death (to the
inhabitants of the house), that a Nyagrodha brings oppression through
(hostile) arms, that an Udumbara brings diseases of the eye.

24\. 'The A*s*vattha is sacred to the sun, the Plaksha to Yama, the
Nyagrodha is the tree that belongs to Varu*n*a, the Udumbara, to
Pra*g*âpati.'

25. <span id="fr_425"></span>[25](#fn_425) He should place those (trees.md)
in another place than their proper one,

26. <span id="fr_426"></span>[26](#fn_426.md) And should sacrifice to those
same deities.

27. <span id="fr_427"></span>[27](#fn_427.md) Let him put wood on the fire
in the middle of the house, and sacrifice a black cow,

28\. Or a white goat,

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

29\. (The one or the other) together with milk-rice.

30\. Or (only) milk-rice.

31\. Having mingled together the fat (of the animal), Â*g*ya, its flesh,
and the milk-rice,

32\. He should take eight portions (of that mixture) and should
sacrifice (the following eight oblations):

33\. The first (verse, accompanying the first oblation), is,
'Vâstoshpati!' (MB. II, 6, 1).

34. <span id="fr_428"></span>[34](#fn_428) (Then follow) the (three.md)
verses of the Vâmadevya,

35\. (And the three) Mahâvyâh*ri*tis.

36. <span id="fr_429"></span>[36](#fn_429.md) The last (oblation is offered
with the formula), 'To Pra*g*âpati (svâhâ).'

37\. After he has sacrificed, he should offer ten Balis,

38\. In the different directions (of the horizon), from left to right,

39\. And in the intermediate points,

40\. In due order, without a transposition.

41\. (He should offer a Bali) in the east with (the formula),
'(Adoration) to Indra!' in the intermediate direction—'To Vâyu!' in the
south—'To Yama!' in the intermediate direction—'(Svadhâ) to the
Fathers!' in the west—'(Adoration) to Varu*n*a!' in the intermediate
direction—'To Mahârâ*g*a!' in the north—'To Soma!' in the intermediate
direction—'To Mahendra!' downwards—

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'To Vâsuki!'
upwards, in the sky (i.e. throwing the Bali into the air), with (the
formula), 'Adoration to Brahman!'

42\. To the east, upwards, and downwards this should be done constantly,
day by day.

43. <span id="fr_430"></span>[43](#fn_430.md) (The whole ceremony is
repeated) every year or at the two sacrifices of the first fruits.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_422"></span>[120:1](sbe30039.htm#fr_422.md) 7, 1 seq. Comp.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV, 2, 6 seq.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[121:19](sbe30039.htm#fr_423.md) 19-21. I have
translated the words of these Sûtras without trying to express any
meaning. According to the commentary the meaning is the following: 19.
He should not build a house which has its door on the back-side, or
which has one front-door and one back-door. 20. The house-door should
not face the door of another house. 21. The house-door should be so
constructed that the householder cannot be seen by *K*â*nd*âlas, &c.,
when he is performing religious acts or when dining in his house. Or, if
instead of sa*m*lokî the reading sa*m*loki is accepted, the Sûtra means:
the house-door should be so constructed, that valuable objects, &c.,
which are in the house, cannot be seen by passers-by.—The commentary on
Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV, 2, 15 contains the remark: dvâradvaya*m* (var.
lectio, dvâra*m* dvâra*m*) parasparam *rig*u na syâd iti ke*k*it. This
seems to me to lead to the right understanding of these Sûtras. I think
we ought to read and to divide in this way: (19) anudvâra*m* *k*a. (20.
21) g*ri*hadvâra*m* yathâ na sa*m*loki syât. 'And (let him construct) a
back-door, so that it does not face the (chief) house-door.' The Khâdira
MSS. have the readings, asallokî, asandraloke, sa*m*loka.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[122:22](sbe30039.htm#fr_424.md) 22-24. These are
*S*lokas to which the commentary very appropriately, though not exactly
in the sense in which it was originally set down, applies the dictum so
frequently found in the Brâhma*n*a texts: na hy ekasmâd aksharâd
virâdhayanti. Dr. Knauer's attempts to restore correct *S*lokas are
perhaps a little hazardous; he inserts in the third verse *k*a after
plakshas, and in the second he changes the first brûyât into *k*a,
whereby the second foot of the hemistich loses its regular shape <span
id="img_12200"></span> ![](img/12200.jpg), and receives instead of it
the form <span id="img_12201"></span> ![](img/12201.jpg).

<span id="fn_425"></span>[122:25](sbe30039.htm#fr_425.md) He should remove
an A*s*vattha tree from the east-side, &c.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[122:26](sbe30039.htm#fr_426.md) He should
sacrifice to the deities to whom the transplanted trees are sacred.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[122:27](sbe30039.htm#fr_427.md) 27 seq. Here
begins the description of the vâstu*s*amana, which extends to Sûtra 43.
As to the animal sacrifice prescribed in this Sûtra, comp. Dr.
Winternitz's essay, Einige Bemerkungen über das Bauopfer bei den Indern
(Sitzungsbericht der Anthrop. Gesellschaft in Wien, 19 April, 1887), p.
8.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[123:34](sbe30039.htm#fr_428.md) Comp. above,
chap. 6, 7 note.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[123:36](sbe30039.htm#fr_429.md) The commentary
says: 'The last oblation should be offered with the formula, "To
Pra*g*âpati svâhâ!"' Probably we ought to correct the text, Pra*g*âpata
ity uttamâ, 'the last (verse) is, "Pra*g*âpati!" (MB. II, 5, 8);' see
above, IV, 6, 9; Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV, 2, 20.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[124:43](sbe30039.htm#fr_430.md) See above, III,
8, 9 seq.
