### PA*T*ALA 4, SECTION 13.

1. <span id="fr_571"></span>[1](#fn_571) With (the formula), 'The milk
of Virâ*g* art thou. May the milk of Padyâ Virâ*g* (dwell) in me'—(the
guest) touches the hands of the person that

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

washes his feet, and then he touches himself with (the formula), 'May in
me dwell brilliancy, energy, strength, life, renown, splendour, glory,
power!'

2\. (The host) then makes to him the announcement, 'The Argha water!'

3. <span id="fr_572"></span>[3](#fn_572) (The guest) accepts it with
(the formula), 'Thou camest to me with glory. Unite me with brilliancy,
splendour, and milk. Make me beloved by all creatures, the lord of
cattle.'

4. <span id="fr_573"></span>[4](#fn_573) 'To the ocean I send you, the
imperishable (waters); go back to your source. May I not suffer loss in
my offspring. May my sap not be shed'—this (verse the guest) recites
over the remainder (of the Argha water), when it is poured out (by the
person who had offered it to him).

5\. Then he utters to him the announcement, 'The water for sipping!'

6. <span id="fr_574"></span>[6](#fn_574) With (the formula), 'Thou art
the first layer for Ambrosia,' he sips water.

7\. Then he utters to him the announcement, 'The honey-mixture!'

8. <span id="fr_575"></span>[8](#fn_575) He accepts that with both hands
with the Sâvitra (formula), and places it on the ground with (the
formula), 'I place thee on the navel of the earth in the abode of
I*d*â.' He mixes (the different substances) three times from left to
right with his thumb and his fourth finger, with (the formula), 'What is
the honied, highest form of honey which consists in the enjoyment of
food, by that honied,

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

highest form of honey may I become highest, honied, and an enjoyer of
food.' He partakes of it three times with (the formula), 'I eat thee for
the sake of brilliancy, of luck, of glory, of power, and of the
enjoyment of food,' and gives the remainder to a person who is kindly
disposed towards him.

9. <span id="fr_576"></span>[9](#fn_576) Or he may eat the whole
(Madhuparka). Then he sips water with (the formula), 'Thou art the
covering of Ambrosia.'

10. <span id="fr_577"></span>[10](#fn_577) Then he utters to him the
announcement, 'The cow!'

11\. That (cow) is either killed or let loose.

12\. If he chooses to let it loose, (he murmurs), 'This cow will become
a milch cow.

'The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the
Âdityas, the navel of immortality. To the people who understand me, I
say, "Do not kill the guiltless cow, which is Aditi."

'Let it drink water! Let it eat grass'—

(And) gives order (to the people), 'Om! Let it loose.'

13. <span id="fr_578"></span>[13](#fn_578) If it shall be killed, (he
says), 'A cow art thou; sin is driven away from thee. Drive away my sin
and the sin of N.N.! Kill ye him whoever hates me. He is killed
whosoever hates me. Make (the cow) ready!'

14. <span id="fr_579"></span>[14](#fn_579) If (the cow) is let loose, a
meal is prepared with other meat, and he announces it (to the guest) in
the words, 'It is ready!'

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

15\. He replies, 'It is well prepared; it is the Virâ*g*; it is food.
May it not fail! May I obtain it! May it give me strength! It is well
prepared!'—and adds, 'Give food to the Brâhma*n*as!'

16. <span id="fr_580"></span>[16](#fn_580) After those (Brâhma*n*as)
have eaten, (the host) orders blameless (?) food to be brought to him
(i.e. to the guest).

17\. He accepts that with (the formula), 'May the heaven give it to
thee; may the earth accept it. May the earth give it to thee; may breath
accept it. May breath eat thee; may breath drink thee.'

18\. With (the verse), 'May Indra and Agni bestow vigour on me' (Taitt.
Sa*m*h. III, 3, 3, 3) he eats as much as he likes, and gives the
remainder to a person who is kindly disposed towards him.

19\. If he desires that somebody may not be estranged from him, he
should sip water with (the Mantra), 'Whereon the past and the future and
all worlds rest, therewith I take hold of thee; I (take. hold) of thee;
through the Brahman I take hold of thee for myself, N.N.!'—
