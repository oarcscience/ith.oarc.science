### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 6.

1. <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md) Thus has spoken Mânatantavya:
'Unoffered indeed becomes the offering of a man who does not eat
fast-day food.

2\. 'He becomes powerless. Hunger will attack him. He does not gain
favour among people. His offspring will be perverse.

3\. 'But he who eats fast-day food, becomes powerful. Hunger will not
attack him. He gains

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

favour among people. His offspring will be still more blessed.

4. <span id="fr_143"></span>[4](#fn_143) 'Therefore (husband and wife.md)
should eat fast-day food which is pleasant to them.'

5\. Let them sleep that night on the ground.

6\. They should spend that night so as to alternate their sleep with
waking, entertaining themselves with tales or with other discourse.

7. <span id="fr_144"></span>[7](#fn_144.md) But they should avoid doing
anything unholy (such as cohabiting together).

8\. It is said, that when on a journey, he should not fast.

9\. For (say they, in that case) the observance has to be kept by his
wife.

10\. Let him do (herein) what he likes.

11\. In the same way also one who has set up the (*S*rauta) fires should
fast—

12\. And (he should observe) what is enjoined by the sacred tradition.

13\. Now in the forenoon, after (the sacrificer) has offered his morning
oblation, and has walked round the fire on its front side, and strewn to
the south of the fire eastward-pointed Darbha grass—

14. <span id="fr_145"></span>[14](#fn_145) (The Brahman.md) stations
himself to the east of that (grass), facing the west, and with the thumb
and the fourth finger of his left hand he takes one grass blade from the
Brahman's seat and throws it away to the south-west, in the intermediate
direction (between south and west), with (the words), 'Away has been
thrown the dispeller of wealth.'

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

15\. Having touched water, he then sits down on the Brahman's seat, with
(the words), 'I sit down on the seat of wealth.'

16. <span id="fr_146"></span>[16](#fn_146.md) Facing the fire he sits
silently, raising his joined hands, till the end of the ceremony.

17\. Let him speak (only) what refers to the due performance of the
sacrifice.

18\. Let him not speak what is unworthy of the sacrifice.

19\. If he has spoken what is unworthy of the sacrifice, let him murmur
a verse, or a Ya*g*us, sacred to Vish*n*u.

20\. Or let him only say, 'Adoration to Vish*n*u!'

21. <span id="fr_147"></span>[21](#fn_147.md) If one wishes, however, to do
himself the work both of the Hot*ri* and of the Brahman, he should in
the same way place on the Brahman's seat a parasol, or an outer garment,
or a water-pot, or a

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

bolster of Darbha grass, and should return in the same way (in which he
has gone to the Brahman's seat), and then should perform the other
(duties).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_142"></span>[28:1](sbe30009.htm#fr_142.md) 6, 1. The teacher's
name is spelt elsewhere Mânutantavya, which seems to be the more correct
spelling. The Khâdira-G*ri*hya (II, I, 5) has Mânadantavya. Dr. Knauer
has called attention to several other blunders of the MSS., which are
unusually frequent just in this passage. For I have no doubt that in
spite of the unanimous agreement of the MSS. we are to change
mânushyâhutir into mânushasyâhutir, and I think it very probable, to say
the least, that in Sûtra 4 kâmayetaupavasathikam should be corrected
into kâmayeyâtâm aupavasathikam, though here the singular could possibly
be defended by very faithful believers in the authority of the MSS.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[29:4](sbe30009.htm#fr_143.md) Or, which is
pleasant to him? See the note on § 1.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[29:7](sbe30009.htm#fr_144.md) Khâdira-G*ri*hya
II, I, 7.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[29:14](sbe30009.htm#fr_145.md) The ceremonies
stated in this Sûtra have to be performed by the Brahman. This is stated
in the commentary, and the comparison <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> of
parallel texts leaves no doubt as to the correctness of this view. Thus
Hira*n*yake*s*in says (I, 1): etasmin kâle brahmâ ya*gñ*opavîta*m*
k*ri*tvâpa â*k*amyâpare*n*âgni*m* dakshi*n*âtikramya brahmasadanât
t*rin*a*m* nirasya, &c. Comp. also the corresponding passages of the
*S*rauta ritual given by Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 17. I
do not think it probable, however, that we should read
brahmâ<sup>ऽ</sup>sanât, so that it would be distinctly expressed by the
text that the Brahman is the subject (comp. Dr. Knauer's Introduction,
p. viii). For we read in this same Sûtra brahmâsanât t*rin*am
abhisa*m*g*ri*hya; in Sûtra 15, brahmâsana upavi*s*ati; in Sûtra 21,
brahmâsane nidhâya: of these passages it is in the second made probable
by the sense, and it is certain in the third, that brahmâsana is to be
understood as a compound equal to brahmasadana. Thus it would, in my
opinion, be unnatural not to explain it in the same way also in the
first passage. Parâvasu is opposed to Vasu (Sûtra 15) in the same way as
some texts, for instance Âpastamba, oppose Parâgvasu to Arvâgvasu.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[30:16](sbe30009.htm#fr_146.md) seqq
Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 1, 19 seqq.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[30:21](sbe30009.htm#fr_147.md) 'In the same way'
refers to the ceremonies stated in Sûtras <span id="page_31">p.
31</span> 13 and 14. On the darbha*k*a*t*u or, as some MSS. read,
darbhava*t*u, see Bloomfield's note on the G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha, I, 88.
89. Knauer gives darbhava*t*u*m* without adding any various readings.
Comp. Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 1, 23.
