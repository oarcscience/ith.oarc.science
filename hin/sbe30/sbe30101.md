### PA*T*ALA 3, SECTION 8.

1. <span id="fr_752"></span>[1](#fn_752.md) At the opening and concluding
ceremonies of the Vedic study, the *Ri*shi who is indicated (as the

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Ri*shi of the
Kâ*nd*a which they study, is the deity to whom the ceremony belongs),

2\. And in the second place Sadasaspati (cf. Mantrap. I, 9, 8).

3\. They reject a sacrifice performed by a wife or by one who has not
received the Upanayana initiation, and a sacrifice of salt or pungent
food, or of such food as has an admixture of a despised sort of food.

4\. Sacrifices connected with special wishes and Bali sacrifices (should
be performed) as stated (even against the clauses of the last Sûtra).

5\. Whenever the fire flames up of itself, he should put two pieces of
wood on it with the next two (verses: M. I, 9, 9-10),

6\. Or with (the two formulas), 'May fortune reach me! May fortune come
to me!'

7\. Let him notice the day on which he brings his wife home.

8\. (From that day) through three nights they should both sleep on the
ground, they should be chaste, and should avoid salt and pungent food.

9\. Between their sleeping-places a staff is interposed, which is
anointed with perfumes and wrapped round with a garment or a thread.

10\. In the last part of the fourth night he takes up the (staff) with
the next two (verses; M. I, 10, 1-2), washes it and put it away; then
(the ceremonies) from the putting of wood on the fire down to the
Â*g*yabhâga oblations (are performed), and while she takes hold of him,
he sacrifices the oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras; M. I, 10,
3-9); then he enters upon the performance of the *G*aya and following
oblations, and performs (the

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire). Then he makes
her sit down to the west of the fire, facing the east, and pours some
Â*g*ya of the remains (of those oblations) on her head with the (three)
Vyâh*ri*tis and the word Om as the fourth (M. I, 10, 10-13). Then they
look at each other with the next two verses (M. I, 11, 1-2), according
to the characteristics (contained in those verses); with the next verse
(M. I, 11, 3) he besmears the region of their hearts with remains of
Â*g*ya; then he should murmur the next three verses (I, 11, 4-6), and
should murmur the rest (of the Anuvâka; I, 11, 7-11) when cohabiting
with her.

11\. Or another person should recite (the rest of the Anuvâka) over her,
(before they cohabit).

12. <span id="fr_753"></span>[12](#fn_753) During her (first.md) monthly
illness he instructs her about the things forbidden (to menstruous
women), contained in the Brâhma*n*a, in the section, 'A menstruous woman
with whom,' &c.

13\. After the appearance of her monthly illness, he should, when going
to cohabit with her after her illness, recite over her, after she has
bathed, the next verses (M. I, 12, 1-13, 4).
