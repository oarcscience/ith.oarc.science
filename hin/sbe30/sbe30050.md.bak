Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 2, SECTION 7.

1. <span id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_516) He then causes (the student.md) to
put on the fire seven pieces of fresh Palâ*s*a wood, with unbroken tops,
of one span's length, which have been anointed with ghee.

2. <span id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_517.md) One (of these pieces of wood he
puts on the fire) with (the Mantra), 'To Agni I have brought a piece of
wood, to the great *G*âtavedas. As thou art inflamed, Agni, through that
piece of wood, thus inflame me through wisdom, insight, offspring,
cattle, holy lustre, and through the enjoyment of food. Svâhâ!'—

3\. (Then he puts on the fire) two (pieces of wood with the same Mantra,
using the dual instead of the

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

singular), 'To Agni (I have brought) two pieces of wood;'

4\. (Then) four (pieces of wood, using the plural), 'To Agni (I have
brought) pieces of wood.'

5. <span id="fr_518"></span>[5](#fn_518) He then sprinkles (water.md) round
(the fire) as above.

6. <span id="fr_519"></span>[6](#fn_519.md) 'Thou hast given thy consent;'
'Thou hast given thy impulse'—thus he changes the end of each Mantra.

7\. He then worships the (following) deities (with the following
Mantras),

8. <span id="fr_520"></span>[8](#fn_520) Agni with (the words.md), 'Agni,
lord of the vow, I shall keep the vow;'

9\. Vâyu with (the words), 'Vâyu, lord of the vow, (&c.);'

10\. Âditya (the sun) with (the words), 'Âditya, lord of the vow,
(&c.);'

11\. The lord of the vows with (the words), 'Lord of the vows, ruling
over the vows (&c.).'

12. <span id="fr_521"></span>[12](#fn_521.md) He then gives an optional
gift to his Guru (i.e. to the teacher).

13. <span id="fr_522"></span>[13](#fn_522) (The teacher.md) makes him rise
with (the verse which the student recites), 'Up! with life' (Taitt.
Sa*m*h. I, 2, 8, 1); he gives him in charge (to the sun) with (the
words), 'Sun! This is thy son; I give him in charge to thee;' and he
worships the sun with (the Mantra), 'That bright eye created by the gods
which rises in the east: may we see it a hundred autumns; may we live a
hundred autumns; may we

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

rejoice a hundred autumns; may we be glad a hundred autumns; may we
prosper a hundred autumns; may we hear a hundred autumns; may we speak a
hundred autumns; may we live undecaying a hundred autumns; and may we
long see the sun.'

14. <span id="fr_523"></span>[14](#fn_523.md) 'May Agni further give thee
life. May Agni further grant thee bliss. May Indra with the Maruts here
give (that) to thee; may the sun with the Vasus give (it) to thee'—with
(this verse the teacher) gives him a staff, and then hands over to him a
bowl (for collecting alms).

15\. Then he says to him, 'Go out for alms.'

16. <span id="fr_524"></span>[16](#fn_524.md) Let him beg of his mother
first;

17. <span id="fr_525"></span>[17](#fn_525) Then (let him beg.md) in other
houses where they are kindly disposed towards him.

18\. He brings (the food which he has received) to his Guru (i.e. to the
teacher), and announces it to him by saying, '(These are) the alms.'

19\. (The teacher accepts it) with the words, 'Good alms they are.'

20. <span id="fr_526"></span>[20](#fn_526.md) 'May all gods bless thee
whose first garment we accept. May after thee, the prosperous one, the
well-born, many brothers and friends be born'—with (this verse the
teacher) takes (for himself) the former garment (of the student).

21\. When the food (with which the Brâhma*n*as shall be entertained) is
ready, (the student) takes some portion of boiled rice, cakes, and
flour, mixes

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (these substances)
with clarified butter, and sacrifices with (the formulas), 'To Agni
svâhâ! To Soma svâhâ! To Agni, the eater of food, svâhâ! To Agni, the
lord of food, svâhâ! To Pra*g*âpati svâhâ! To the Vi*s*ve devâs svâhâ!
To all deities svâhâ! To Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t svâhâ!'

22\. Thus (let him sacrifice) wherever (oblations of food are
prescribed) for which the deities (to whom they shall be offered) are
not indicated.

23. <span id="fr_527"></span>[23](#fn_527.md) If the deity is indicated,
(let him sacrifice) with (the words), 'To such and such (a deity)
svâhâ!' according to which deity it is.

24. <span id="fr_528"></span>[24](#fn_528) Taking (again.md) some portion
of the same kinds of food, he offers it as a Bali on eastward-pointed
Darbha grass, with (the words), 'To Vâstupati (i.e. Vâstoshpati) svâhâ!'

25. <span id="fr_529"></span>[25](#fn_529.md) After he has served those
three kinds of food to the Brâhma*n*as, and has caused them to say, 'An
auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!'—
