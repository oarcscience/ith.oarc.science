### KÂ*ND*IKÂ <span id="fr_134"></span>[5](#fn_134.md).

1\. Now at the times of the new moon and of the full moon (the following
ceremonies are performed).

2. <span id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_135.md) Let him fast on that full-moon
day (when the full moon rises) at the meeting (of day and night).

3. <span id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_136.md) The following day, according to
some (teachers).

4\. And on that day on which the moon is not seen, (he should fast,
considering it) as the new-moon day.

5\. The ends of the half-months are the time for fasting, the beginnings
for sacrifice.

6. <span id="fr_137"></span>[6](#fn_137.md) With the sacrificial food of
the new-moon

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

sacrifice he celebrates the first half (of the month), with that of the
full-moon sacrifice the second.

7. <span id="fr_138"></span>[7](#fn_138.md) Full-moon is the greatest
distance of sun and moon; new-moon is their nearest approach.

8\. That day on which the moon is not seen, that he should take as the
day of new-moon.

9\. Sometimes he may also while (the moon) is (still) visible (accept it
as the day of new-moon); for (already then the moon) has made its way.

10. <span id="fr_139"></span>[10](#fn_139.md) The time of full-moon is
reckoned in three ways: (when the full moon rises at) the meeting (of
day and night), or when it rises after sunset, or when it stands high
(in the sky at sunset).

11\. Now on what day it becomes full—

12\. The doctrine on this point has to be studied

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

separately. One should study it, or should ascertain separately (the
exact time of) the Parvan from those who know it.

13\. Now on the day which is the fast-day, on that day, in the forenoon,
having offered his morning oblation, he besmears that surface on which
the fire is placed, on all sides with cow-dung.

14\. He then gets the pieces of wood ready (which are to be put on the
fire)—of Khadira or of Palâ*s*a wood.

15\. If Khadira or Palâ*s*a wood cannot be obtained, it may be wood—as
far as it serves the purpose—of any tree, with the exception of
Vibhîdaka, Tilvaka, Bâdhaka, Nîva, Nimba, Râ*g*av*ri*ksha, *S*almali,
Aralu, Dadhittha, Kovidâra, *S*leshmâtaka wood.

16\. The Barhis consists of Ku*s*a grass cut off at the points at which
the blades diverge from the main stalk.

17\. (The blades should be) cut off near the roots at (the ceremonies
directed to) the Fathers.

18\. If that (i.e. Ku*s*a grass) cannot be obtained, (he may take) any
kind of grass, with the exception of *S*ûka grass, of Saccharum reed, of
such grass as is apt to break, of Balba*g*a grass, of Mutava, of
Amphidonax reed, of *S*u*nth*a.

19. <span id="fr_140"></span>[19](#fn_140.md) (He should get ready the
following things, viz.) Â*g*ya, rice or barley to be cooked for the
sacrifice, the pot in which the oblation of cooked rice (or barley) is
prepared, the pot-ladle, the Sruva, the water fetched from a hidden
place—

20\. And the other things which we shall mention in the course of (our
exposition of) the ritual.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

21\. On that day he should not go away (from his house on a journey,
&c.);

22\. Even from a distant place he should return to his house.

23\. (On that day) he may buy goods from others, but not sell (such
goods).

24\. Let him not speak much.

25\. Let him strive to speak the truth.

26. <span id="fr_141"></span>[26](#fn_141.md) In the afternoon husband and
wife, after having bathed, should eat fast-day food which is pleasant to
them. It should contain butter (and should be prepared) in the due way.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_134"></span>[25:5](sbe30008.htm#fr_134.md) Description of the
sacrifices of the full and new moon. Paradigm of the regular Sthâlîpâka
offering. The first twelve Sûtras of this chapter have been translated
by Professor Weber, Ueber den Vedakalender namens Jyotisham, pp. 50 seq.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[25:2](sbe30008.htm#fr_135.md) See the note below
at Sûtra 10.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[25:3](sbe30008.htm#fr_136.md) With these two
Sûtras, 'sandhyâ*m* paur*n*amâsîm upavaset; uttarâm ity eke,' a passage
should be compared which is identically found in the Aitareya (VII, 11),
and in the Kaushîtaka Brâhma*n*a (III, 1): pûrvâ*m* paur*n*amâsîm
upavased iti Paiṅgyam, uttarâm iti Kaushîtakam.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[25:6](sbe30008.htm#fr_137.md) The month is
reckoned here, as is usually done, as beginning with the fortnight of
the increasing moon.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[26:7](sbe30008.htm#fr_138.md) Here begins a new
exposition of the question of full and new moon which stands
independently by the side of the former sections, and which Gobhila has
not taken much care to weld together with them. Comp. Sûtra to with
Sûtras 2 and 3, and Sûtra 8 with Sûtra 4.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[26:10](sbe30008.htm#fr_139.md) The first of the
three times is that mentioned in Sûtra 2. It seems to me not very safe
to interpret sandhyâ in that modern sense, in which sandhi is used, for
instance, in the verse quoted by Mâdhava, Weber, Jyotisha 51, so that it
designates the meeting-point of the bright and of the dark fortnight
('âvartane yadâ sandhi*h* parvapratipador bhavet,' &c.). If sandhyâ were
that, we should expect that the same word would occupy a similar
position in the definition of amâvâsyâ. I prefer, therefore, with the
commentary, to understand sandhyâ in its ancient sense, as the time
which divides day from night. Thus sandhyâ paur*n*amâsî, the full-moon
day, on which the moon rises at the meeting of day and night, stands in
opposition to uttarâ paur*n*amâsî (Sûtra 2), or to astamitoditâ (scil.
paur*n*amâsî, Sûtra 10), exactly in the same way as in the Brâhma*n*a
passages quoted above (note on § 3) pûrvâ paur*n*amâsî is opposed to
uttarâ paur*n*amâsî. The second and third cases are those of the full
moon rising (shortly) after sunset, and of the moon becoming full when
standing high in the sky.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[27:19](sbe30008.htm#fr_140.md) As to anuguptâ
âpa*h*, see above, chap. I, 9.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[28:26](sbe30008.htm#fr_141.md) Khâdira-G*ri*hya
II, 1, 4. 6. The commentary explains ku*s*alena: it should be easy to
digest. Comp. below, II, 1, 2: (dârân kurvîta) laksha*n*apra*s*astân
ku*s*alena.
