one garment (for the Fathers in common).

performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

21. <span id="fr_400"></span>[21](#fn_400.md) Vegetables (are taken instead

22\. At animal sacrifices offered to the Fathers let—

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

him sacrifice the omentum with (the verse), 'Carry the omentum, O
*G*âtavedas, to the Fathers' (MB. II, 3, 16);

23\. At (such sacrifices) offered to the gods, with (the verse),
'*G*âtavedas, go to the gods with the omentum' (ibid. 17).

24\. If no (god to whom the sacrifice should be offered, and no Mantra
with which the oblation should be made) is known, he sacrifices,
assigning (his offering to the personified rite which he is performing),
thus as (for instance), 'To the Ash*t*akâ Svâhâ!'

performed) according to the Sthâlîpâka rite.

Khâdira-G*ri*hya III, 5, 35. Comp. M.M., 'India, what can it teach us?'
p. 240. The word Sthâlîpâka is used here, as is observed in the
commentary, in order to exclude the mess of meat (chap. 2, 14) from the
rites of the Pi*nd*apit*ri*ya*gñ*a.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[111:3](sbe30036.htm#fr_388.md) Anvâhârya
literally means, what is offered (or given) after something else,
supplementary. In the commentary on Gobhila, p. 666, a verse is quoted:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

amâvâsyâ*m* dvitîya*m* yad anvâhârya*m* tad u*k*yate,

</div>

'The second (*S*râddha) which is performed on the day of the new moon,
that is called anvâhârya.' First comes the Pi*nd*apit*ri*ya*gñ*a, and
then follows the Anvâhârya *S*râddha; the last is identical with the
Pârva*n*a *S*râddha, which is described as the chief form of *S*râddha
ceremonies, for instance in *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya IV, 1. Comp. Manu III,
122. 123, and Kullûka's note; M.M., 'India, what can it teach us?' p.

note.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[113:26](sbe30036.htm#fr_402.md) I am not sure
about the translation of the words golakânâ*m* madhyamapar*n*ena. The
ordinary meaning of golaka is 'ball,' see, for instance,
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya IV, 19, 4. The commentary says, golakânâ*m*
palâ*s*âna*m* madhyamapar*n*ena madhyama*kkh*adena.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[113:29](sbe30036.htm#fr_403.md) The name of the
third of those rural deities is spelt differently; Dr. Knauer gives the
readings, Ara*d*âm, Ara*th*âm, Aragam, Ararâm, Aram.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[114:32](sbe30036.htm#fr_404.md) 32-34.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya III, 5, 40. I understand that this sacrifice stands in
connection with the rural festivals which are treated of in the
preceding Sûtras. In the commentary, from the mantra the conclusion is
drawn that the ceremony in question belongs to the day of the
Ekâsh*t*akâ. But the Ekâsh*t*akâ is the Ash*t*akâ of the dark fortnight
of Mâgha (see S.B.E. XXIX, 102), and the description of the rites
belonging to that day has already been given above, Sûtras 17-21. It
very frequently occurs in the G*ri*hya ritual that Mantras are used at
sacrifices standing in no connection with those for which they have
originally been composed.
