------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 6, SECTION 14.

1\. The Sîmantonnayana (or parting of the pregnant wife's hair, is
performed) in her first pregnancy, in the fourth month.

2\. (The husband) serves food to Brâhma*n*as and causes them to
pronounce auspicious wishes; then, after (the ceremonies) from the
putting (of wood) on the fire down to the Â*g*yabhâga oblations (have
been performed), he offers the oblations (indicated in the) next
(Mantras, M. II, 11, 1-8), while (the wife) takes hold of him, and
enters upon the (performance) of the *G*aya and following oblations.

3\. Having performed (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round
(the fire), he makes her sit down to the west of the fire, facing the
east, and parts her hair upwards (i.e. beginning from the front) with a
porcupine's quill that has three white spots,

with three Darbha blades, and with a bunch of unripe Udumbara fruits,
with the Vyâh*ri*tis or with the two next (verses, II, 11, 9. 10).

4\. He says to two lute-players, 'Sing!'

5\. Of the next two (verses, II, 11, 11. 12) the first (is to be sung on
this occasion) among the (people of the) Sâlvas.

6. <span id="fr_767"></span>[6](#fn_767) The second (is to be used.md) for
Brâhma*n*as; and the river near which they dwell is to be named.

7. <span id="fr_768"></span>[7](#fn_768.md) He ties barley-grains with
young shoots (to the head of the wife); then she keeps silence until the
stars appear.

8\. When the stars have appeared, he goes (with his wife) towards the
east or north, touches a calf, and murmurs the Vyâh*ri*tis; then she
breaks her silence.

9\. The Pu*m*savana (i.e. the ceremony to secure the birth of a male
child) is performed when the pregnancy has become visible, under the
constellation Tishya.

10\. From a branch of a Nyagrodha tree, which points eastward or
northward, he takes a shoot with two (fruits that look like) testicles.
The putting (of wood) on the fire, &c., is performed as at the
Sîmantonnayana (Sûtra 2).

11\. He causes a girl who has not yet attained maturity to pound (the
Nyagrodha shoot) on an upper mill-stone with another upper mill-stone,
and to pour water on it; then he makes his wife lie

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

down on her back to the west of the fire, facing the east, and inserts
(the pounded substance) with his thumb into her right nostril, with the
next Ya*g*us (II, 11, 13).

12\. Then she will give birth to a son.

13\. Here follows the ceremony to secure a quick deliverance.

14\. With a shallow cup that has not been used before, he draws water in
the direction of the river's current; at his wife s feet he lays down a
Tûryantî plant; he should then touch his wife, who is soon to be
delivered, on the head, with the next Ya*g*us (II, 11, 14), and should
sprinkle her with the water, with the next (three) verses (II, 11,
15-17).

15\. Yadi *g*arâyu na pated eva*m*vihitâbhir evâdbhir uttarâbhyâm (II,
11, 18. 19) avokshet.

Sudar*s*anârya mentions that instead of the singular, 'She keeps
silence, she breaks her silence,' some read the dual, so that the
husband and his wife are referred to.
