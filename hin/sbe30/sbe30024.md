### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 2.

1. <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_266.md) For the Mahânâmnî verses (the
Vrata is to be kept) twelve years,

2\. (Or) nine, six, three (years).

3\. These are the various possibilities.

4\. Or also one year, according to some (teachers).

5\. (In this case), however, the observances are enhanced.

6\. (Keeping the Vrata through one year is allowed only) if (the
student's) ancestors have learnt the Mahânâmnî verses.

7\. There is also a Brâhma*n*a of the Rauruki (*S*âkhâ, in which it is
said):

8\. 'The mothers forsooth say to their sons, when they suckle them:

9\. '"Become men, my little sons, who endeavour to accomplish the
*S*akvarî-vrata!"'

10. <span id="fr_267"></span>[10](#fn_267.md) During (the Vrata preparatory
to the study of) these (i.e. the Mahânâmnî verses), touching water at
the time of each Savana (is prescribed).

11\. Let him not eat in the morning before he has touched water.

12. <span id="fr_268"></span>[12](#fn_268.md) In the evening, after he has
touched water, he should not eat, before he has put the piece of wood on
the fire.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

13\. He should wear dark clothes.

14\. He should eat dark food.

15\. Let him be devoted to his teacher.

16\. Let him make way for nobody.

17\. He should be addicted to austerities.

18\. He should stand in day-time.

19\. He should sit at night.

20\. And when it is raining, he should not retire to a covered place.

21\. He should say to (the god) when he sends rain, 'The *S*akvarîs are
water.'

22\. When (the god) sends lightning, he should say to him, 'Such
forsooth is the nature of the *S*akvarîs.'

23\. When (the god) thunders, he should say to him, 'The great voice of
the great (cow)!'

24\. Let him not cross a river without touching water.

25\. Let him not ascend a ship.

26\. If his life is in danger, however, he may ascend (a ship), after
having touched water.

27\. In the same way (he should touch water) having disembarked.

28\. For in water the virtue of the Mahânâmnîs is contained.

29\. If he practises these duties, (the god) Par*g*anya will send rain
according to his wish.

30. <span id="fr_269"></span>[30](#fn_269.md) The rules about dark
(clothes), standing, sitting, (making) way, and (dark) food may be
considered as optional.

31\. After he has kept his vow through one third (of the prescribed
time, the teacher) should

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

sing to him the (first) Stotriya verse (of the Mahânâmnîs).

32\. In the same way the two other Stotriya verses (after two-thirds of
the time and at the end of the whole time).

33\. Or all (the three verses) at the end of the whole (time).

34\. He should sing them to (the student) who has fasted and shuts his
eyes.

35. <span id="fr_270"></span>[35](#fn_270.md) Having filled a brass vessel
with water, having thrown into it all sorts of herbs, and dipped (the
student's) hands into it, the teacher should veil (the student's eyes)
from left to right with a (new) garment that has not yet been washed.

36. <span id="fr_271"></span>[36](#fn_271.md) Or he should sing (the
Mahânâmnîs to him) immediately after he has veiled (his eyes).

37. <span id="fr_272"></span>[37](#fn_272.md) With veiled eyes, keeping
silence, he should abstain from food through a period of three nights,
or through one day and one night.

38\. Or he should stand in the forest till sunset (and spend the night
in the village).

39\. On the next morning he should put wood on the fire in the forest,
should sacrifice with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, and should cause the student
to look at (the following objects, viz.)

40\. Fire, Â*g*ya, the sun, a Brahman, a bull, food, water, curds,

41\. With (the words), 'The sky have I beheld! Light have I beheld!'

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

42\. In that way all (the objects stated in Sûtra 40) three times.

43. <span id="fr_273"></span>[43](#fn_273.md) After the ceremony for
averting evil has been performed, the student respectfully salutes the
teacher.

44\. Thus he has to break the silence (enjoined upon him).

45. <span id="fr_274"></span>[45](#fn_274.md) A bull, a brass vessel, a
garment, an optional gift (of a cow): this is the sacrificial fee.

46\. The first time he may choose (either a bull or a brass vessel).

47\. Let him provide his teacher with clothes, according to some
(teachers).

48. <span id="fr_275"></span>[48](#fn_275.md) A mess of cooked food, sacred
to Indra, (is prepared). Let him sacrifice of that (food) with this
verse, 'To the *Rik*, to the Sâman we sacrifice' (Sâma-veda I, 369), or
(with the verse), 'The lord of the seat, the wonderful' (ibid. I, 171),
or with both (verses).

49. <span id="fr_276"></span>[49](#fn_276) This (he should do) at (all.md)
the Anuprava*k*anîya ceremonies.

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

50. <span id="fr_277"></span>[50](#fn_277.md) The Mantra has to be altered
everywhere (so that he has to say), 'I have kept (the vow),' 'I have
been able,' 'Thereby I have prospered,' 'I have undergone.'

51. <span id="fr_278"></span>[51](#fn_278.md) The fee to be given after the
study of the Parvans is, a goat for the Agni-Parvan, a ram for the
Indra-Parvan, a cow for the Pavamâna-Parvan.

52\. After (the student) has returned (from the forest), he should
entertain his teacher and his retinue with food,

53\. And his fellow-students who have come together.

54\. The way to sing the *G*yesh*th*asâmans has been explained by (the
statements given with regard to) the Mahânâmnî-(vrata).

55. <span id="fr_279"></span>[55](#fn_279.md) Here the following standing
duties are to be observed:

56\. He should not have intercourse with a *S*ûdrâ woman.

57\. He should not eat bird's flesh.

58. <span id="fr_280"></span>[58](#fn_280.md) He should avoid (constantly
living on) the same grain, and in the same place, and wearing one
garment.

59\. He should perform the rite of 'touching water' with water drawn out
(of a pond, &c.).

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

60. <span id="fr_281"></span>[60](#fn_281) From (the time of.md) his being
directed (to observe the duties of his Vrata) he should not eat from an
earthen vessel,

61\. Nor drink (from such a vessel),

62. <span id="fr_282"></span>[62](#fn_282) (Or rather.md) from (the time
of) his being taught (the *G*yesh*th*asâmans, after the whole
preparatory time, or after one third of that time), according to some
(teachers).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_266"></span>[72:1](sbe30024.htm#fr_266.md) 2, 1. Regarding the
Mahânâmnî or *S*akvarî verses and the observances connected with their
study, comp. *S*âṅkhâyana II, 12 (see especially the note on II, 12, 13)
and the sixth Adhyâya of that text. Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 5, 22 seq.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[72:10](sbe30024.htm#fr_267.md) The rules as to
'touching water' have been given above, I, 2, 5 seq. The three Savanas
or Soma-pressings of which the Soma sacrifice consists, are the
prâta*h*-savana, the mâdhyandina-savana, and the t*ri*tîya-savana, i.e.
the morning Savana, the midday Savana, and the third or evening Savana.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[72:12](sbe30024.htm#fr_268.md) Comp. above, II,
10, 46; III, I, 27.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[73:30](sbe30024.htm#fr_269.md) See Sûtras 13. 18.
19. 16. 14.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[74:35](sbe30024.htm#fr_270.md) Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya VI, 3, 7.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[74:36](sbe30024.htm#fr_271.md) I.e. the fasting
prescribed in Sûtras 34 and 37 may, if they like, follow after the
teaching of the sacred song, instead of preceding it.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[74:37](sbe30024.htm#fr_272.md)
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, 12, 6 seq.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[75:43](sbe30024.htm#fr_273.md) Comp. above, I, 9,
29; *S*âṅkhâyana VI, 3, 11 seq.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[75:45](sbe30024.htm#fr_274.md) 45, 46. The
student is to give a fee to his teacher three times, after he has been
taught each of the three Stotriya verses (Sûtras 31. 32). To these three
occasions the four objects stated in Sûtra 45 correspond, so that the
first time either the first or the second of those objects, the bull or
the brass vessel, may be chosen; the second time he gives a garment, the
third time a vara (or optional gift). Comp. the similar correspondence
of four objects and three cases to which these objects refer, II, 10, 8.
52.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[75:48](sbe30024.htm#fr_275.md) This is the
Anuprava*k*anîya ceremony (or ceremony to be performed after the study
of a Vedic text has been finished) belonging to the Mahânâmnîs; comp.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 5, 34; Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya I, 22, 1 2;
*S*âṅkhâyana II, 8, 1 note.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[75:49](sbe30024.htm#fr_276.md) Perhaps sarvatra
('everywhere') belongs to Sûtra 49, so that we should have to translate:
This (should be done) everywhere at <span id="page_76">p. 76</span> the
Anuprava*k*anîya ceremonies, i.e. also at those Anuprava*k*anîya
ceremonies which are connected with the study of the other texts.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[76:50](sbe30024.htm#fr_277.md) Instead of 'I will
keep the vow,' he says, 'I have kept the vow,' &c.; II, 10, 16.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[76:51](sbe30024.htm#fr_278.md) The Parvans are
the three great sections, sacred to Agni, Indra, and Soma Pavâmana, into
which the first Sâmavedâr*k*ika is divided.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[76:55](sbe30024.htm#fr_279.md) According to the
commentary he has to keep these observances through his whole life.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[76:58](sbe30024.htm#fr_280.md) Or, wearing always
the same garment?

<span id="fn_281"></span>[77:60](sbe30024.htm#fr_281.md) Regarding the
directions given to the student by the teacher, see chap. 1, 14.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[77:62](sbe30024.htm#fr_282.md) See above, Sûtras
31. 33.
