### PA*T*ALA 1, SECTION 4.

1. <span id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_490.md) Makes the boy tread on (that
stone) with his right foot, with (the verse), 'Tread on this stone; like
a stone be firm. Destroy those who seek to do thee harm; overcome thy
enemies.'

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

2. <span id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_491) After (the boy.md) has taken off
his old (garment), (the teacher) makes him put on a (new) garment that
has not yet been washed, with (the verses),

'The goddesses who spun, who wove, who spread out, and who drew out the
skirts on both sides, may those goddesses clothe thee with long life.
Blessed with life put on this garment.

'Dress him; through (this) garment make him reach a hundred (years) of
age; extend his life. B*ri*haspati has given this garment to king Soma
that he may put it on.

'Mayst thou live to old age; put on the garment! Be a protector of the
human tribes against imprecation. Live a hundred years, full of vigour;
clothe thyself in the increase of wealth.'

3. <span id="fr_492"></span>[3](#fn_492) Having (thus) made (the boy.md)
put on (the new garment, the teacher) recites over him (the verse),

'Thou hast put on this garment for the sake of welfare; thou hast become
a protector of thy friends against imprecation. Live a hundred long
years; a noble man, blessed with life, mayst thou distribute wealth.'

4. <span id="fr_493"></span>[4](#fn_493.md) He then winds the girdle three
times from left to right round (the boy, so that it covers) his navel.
(He does so only) twice, according to some (teachers). (It is done) with
(the verse),

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

'Here she has come to us who drives away sin, purifying our guard and
our protection, bringing us strength by (the power of) inhalation and
exhalation, the sister of the gods, this blessed girdle.'

5\. On the north side of the navel he makes a threefold knot (in the
girdle) and draws that to the south side of the navel.

6. <span id="fr_494"></span>[6](#fn_494.md) He then arranges for him the
skin (of an antelope, &c., see Sûtra 7) as an outer garment, with (the
Mantras),

'The firm, strong eye of Mitra, glorious splendour, powerful and
flaming, a chaste, mobile vesture, this skin put on, a valiant (man),
N.N.!

'May Aditi tuck up thy garment, that thou mayst study the Veda, for the
sake of insight and belief and of not forgetting what thou hast learnt,
for the sake of holiness and of holy lustre!'

7. <span id="fr_495"></span>[7](#fn_495.md) The skin of a black antelope
(is worn) by a Brâhma*n*a, the skin of a spotted deer by a Râ*g*anya,
the skin of a he-goat by a Vai*s*ya.

8. <span id="fr_496"></span>[8](#fn_496.md) He then gives him in charge (to
the gods), a Brâhma*n*a with (the verse), 'We give this (boy) in charge,
O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great learning. May he (Brahman?)
lead him to old age, and may he (the boy) long watch over learning.'

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

A Râ*g*anya (he gives in charge to the gods) with (the verse), 'We give
this boy in charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great royalty.
May he lead him to old age, and may he long watch over royalty.'

A Vai*s*ya (he gives in charge) with (the verse), 'We give this boy in
charge, O Indra, to Brahman, for the sake of great wealth. May he lead
him to old age, and may he long watch over wealth.'

9. <span id="fr_497"></span>[9](#fn_497) (The teacher.md) makes him sit
down to the west of the fire, facing the north, and makes him eat the
remnants of the sacrificial food, with these (Mantras), 'On thee may
wisdom, on thee may offspring' (Taitt. Âra*n*yaka, Andhra redaction, X,
44),—altering (the text of the Mantras).

10. <span id="fr_498"></span>[10](#fn_498) Some make (the student.md) eat
'sprinkled butter.'

11\. (The teacher) looks at (the student) while he is eating, with the
two verses, 'At every pursuit we invoke strong (Indra)' (Taitt. Sa*m*h.
IV, 1, 2, 1), (and), 'Him, Agni, lead to long life and splendour'
(Taitt: Sa*m*h. II, 3, 10, 3).

12\. Some make (the boy) eat (that food with these two verses).

13. <span id="fr_499"></span>[13](#fn_499) After (the boy.md) has sipped
water, (the teacher) causes him to touch (water) and recites over him
(the verse), 'A hundred autumns are before us, O gods, before ye have
made our bodies decay, before (our)

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

sons have become fathers; do not destroy us before we have reached (our
due) age.'

End of the First Pa*t*ala.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_490"></span>[146:1](sbe30047.htm#fr_490.md) 4, 1. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana I, 13, 12; Pâraskara I, 7, 1.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[147:2](sbe30047.htm#fr_491.md) Pâraskara I, 4,
13. 1 2; Atharva-veda II, 13, 2. 3 (XIX, 24). Instead of paridâtavâ u,
we ought to read, as the Atharva-veda has, paridhâtavâ u.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[147:3](sbe30047.htm#fr_492.md) Atharva-veda II,
13, 3; XIX, 24, 6.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[147:4](sbe30047.htm#fr_493.md) *S*âṅkhâyana II,
2, 1; Pâraskara II, 2, 8. The text of the Mantra as given by
Hira*n*yake*s*in is very corrupt, but the corruptions may be as old as
the Hira*n*yake*s*i-sûtra itself, or even older.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[148:6](sbe30047.htm#fr_494.md) I propose to
correct *g*arish*n*u into *k*arish*n*u. See *S*âṅkhâyana II, 1, 30.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[148:7](sbe30047.htm#fr_495.md) *S*âṅkhâyana II,
1, 2. 4. 5, &c.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[148:8](sbe30047.htm#fr_496.md) In the first
hemistich I propose to correct pari dadhmasi into pari dadmasi. The
verse seems to be an adaptation of a Mantra which contained a form of
the verb pari-dhâ (comp. Atharva-veda XIX, 24, 2); thus the reading pari
. . . dadhmasi found in the MSS. may be easily accounted for. The second
hemistich is very corrupt, but the Atharva-veda (loc. cit.: yathaina*m*
*g*arase nayât) shows at least the general sense.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[149:9](sbe30047.htm#fr_497.md) The text of those
Mantras runs thus, 'On me may wisdom, &c.'; he alters them so as to say,
'On thee,' &c.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[149:10](sbe30047.htm#fr_498.md) Regarding the
term sprinkled butter,' comp. Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya IV, 1, 18. 19.
