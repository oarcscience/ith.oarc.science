### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 8.

1. <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_231) On the third (Tithi.md) of the
third bright fortnight after his birth, in the morning the father has
the child washed, including his head, and after sunset, when the
evening-red has disappeared, he worships (the moon), holding up his
joined hands.

2\. Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment, hands
him, from south to north, with his face turned to the north, to the
father.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

3\. She then passes behind his back and stations herself to the north
(of her husband).

4\. He then murmurs (the three verses), 'Thy heart, O thou whose hair is
well parted' (MB. I, 5, 10-12), and after he has, with the words
(standing at the end of verse 12), 'That this son may not come to harm
(and thus be torn) from his mother'—

5\. Handed him, from south to north, to his mother, they may do what
they like.

6. <span id="fr_232"></span>[6](#fn_232.md) Then in the following bright
fortnights (at the time) stated above (Sûtra I), the father, filling his
joined hands with water and turning his face towards the moon, worships
it—

7\. Letting (the water) flow (out of his joined hands) once with the
Ya*g*us, 'What in the moon' (MB. I, 5, 13), and twice silently. Then
they may do what they like.

8. <span id="fr_233"></span>[8](#fn_233.md) When ten nights have elapsed
after (the child's) birth, or a hundred nights, or one year, the
Nâmadheyakara*n*a (or giving a name to the child, is performed).

9\. He who is going to perform (that ceremony—the father or a
representative of the father), sits down to the west of the fire on
northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.

10. <span id="fr_234"></span>[10](#fn_234.md) Then the mother, having
dressed the son in a clean garment, hands him, from south to north,

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

with his face turned to the north, to the performer (of the ceremony).

11\. She then passes behind his back and sits down to the north (of
him), on northward-pointed Darbha grass.

12. <span id="fr_235"></span>[12](#fn_235.md) He then sacrifices to
Pra*g*âpati, to the Tithi (of the child's birth), to the Nakshatra (of
the child's birth), and to the (presiding) deity (of that Tithi and of
that Nakshatra).

13\. He then murmurs the Mantra, 'Who art thou? What person art thou?'
(MB. I, 5, 14. 15), touching the sense-organs at (the boy's) head.

14. <span id="fr_236"></span>[14](#fn_236.md) In (the passage of the
Mantra), 'Enter upon the month, that belongs to Ahaspati (i.e. the lord
of days), N.N.!' and at the end of the Mantra he should give him a name
beginning with a sonant, with a semivowel in it, with a long vowel or
the Visarga at the end, (and formed with) a K*ri*t (suffix).

15\. It should not contain a Taddhita (suffix).

16\. (He should give a name with) an odd (number of syllables), ending
in -dâ, to girls.

17\. And after he has told the name to the mother first, they may do
what they like.

18\. A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.

19. <span id="fr_237"></span>[19](#fn_237) Every month (after the birth.md)
of the boy, (or)

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

after one year, or on the Parvan days of the year (i.e. on the last
Tithi of each of the three seasons) he should sacrifice to Agni and
Indra, to Heaven and Earth, and to the Vi*s*ve devâs.

20. <span id="fr_238"></span>[20](#fn_238.md) Having sacrificed to the
deity (of the Tithi and of the Nakshatra respectively), he should
sacrifice to the Tithi and to the Nakshatra.

21. <span id="fr_239"></span>[21](#fn_239) When (the father.md) returns
from a journey, or when (the son) begins to know, 'This is my father,'
or when (the son) has been initiated, (the father) should grasp with his
two hands his son round the head, and should murmur, 'From limb by limb
thou art produced' (MB. I, 5, 16-18).

22\. With (the formula), 'With the cattle's hi*m*kâra I kiss thee' (l.l.
19) he should kiss him. Then he may do what he likes.

23\. In the same way (he should do) to his younger sons—

24\. According to their age or in the order in which he meets them.

25. <span id="fr_240"></span>[25](#fn_240.md) Girls he should silently kiss
on their head; he should silently kiss them on their head.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_231"></span>[56:1](sbe30020.htm#fr_231.md) 8, 1 seq.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[57:6](sbe30020.htm#fr_232.md) I am not sure about
the meaning of prathamoddish*t*a eva. I have translated according to the
commentary, which has the following note: prathamoddish*t*a eva
prathama*m* ya*h* kâla uddish*t*a*h* kathita*h* tasminn eva kâle
t*ri*tîyâyâm ity etat.—The commentary then mentions a reading
prathamodita eva, in which udita may either be derived from vad or from
ud-i.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[57:8](sbe30020.htm#fr_233.md) 8 seq. The
Nâmakara*n*a. Khâdira-G*ri*hya. II, 3, 6 seq.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[57:10](sbe30020.htm#fr_234.md) 10, 11. Comp.
above, Sûtras 2. 3.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[58:12](sbe30020.htm#fr_235.md)
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 25, 5. In the same G*ri*hya the enumeration of
the Nakshatras with their presiding deities is given, I, 26.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[58:14](sbe30020.htm#fr_236.md)
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 24, 4; Â*s*valâyana I, 15, 4; Pâraskara I, 17,
2. In the text read dîrghâbhinish*t*ânânta*m* instead of
dîrghâbhinish*th*ânânta*m*.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[58:19](sbe30020.htm#fr_237.md) Monthly sacrifice
in commemoration of the child's birth. Possibly we should translate:
Every month (after the birth) of the boy, through one year (comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana I, 25, 10. 11), or on the Parvan days, &c.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[59:20](sbe30020.htm#fr_238.md)

<span id="fn_239"></span>[59:21](sbe30020.htm#fr_239.md) 21 seq. The
father's returning from a journey. Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 3,13 seq. As to
upeta, comp. *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, I, 1 note. The position of the
words in Sûtra 21 is irregular, so as to raise the suspicion that the
words yadâ vâ. . . . upetasya vi ('or when the son begins to know . . .
has been initiated') are an insertion into the text of Gobhila, made by
a later compiler, or into a more ancient text, made by Gobhila himself.
Comp. Pâraskara I, 18.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[59:25](sbe30020.htm#fr_240.md) As to the
repetition of the last words of this Sûtra, see the notes on I, 4, 31;
II, 10, 50; III, 6, 15.
