*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 2.

1. <span id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106) He takes as his ya*gñ*opavîta
(i.e. sacrificial cord) a string, or a garment, or simply a rope of
Ku*s*a grass.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

2\. Raising his right arm, putting the head into (the upavîta), he
suspends (the cord) over his left shoulder, so that it hangs down on his
right side: thus he becomes ya*gñ*opavîtin.

3\. Raising his left arm, putting the head into (the upavîta), he
suspends it over his right shoulder, so that it hangs down on his left
side: thus he becomes prâ*k*înâvîtin.

4\. Prâ*k*înâvîtin, however, he is only at sacrifices offered to the
Manes.

5. <span id="fr_107"></span>[5](#fn_107) Having gone in a northern
direction from the fire, having washed his hands and feet, and having
seated himself, he should sip water three times and wipe off (the water)
twice.

6\. Having besprinkled his feet (with water) let him besprinkle his
head.

7\. Let him touch the organs of his senses with water:

8\. The two eyes, the nose, the two ears.

9\. Whatever (limb of his body) requires his consideration (whether it
is pure or not), that he should touch with water (i.e. with a wet hand).

10\. Here they say:

11\. Let him not touch (himself with water, or sip water) while walking,

12\. Nor standing,

13\. Nor laughing,

14\. Nor looking about,

15\. Nor without bending down,

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

16\. Nor (throwing up the water) with his fingers,

17. <span id="fr_108"></span>[17](#fn_108) Nor except with the (proper)
Tîrtha,

18\. Nor uttering a sound,

19\. Nor without looking (at the water),

20. <span id="fr_109"></span>[20](#fn_109) Nor with his shoulders put
back,

21. <span id="fr_110"></span>[21](#fn_110) Nor wearing a part of his
under garment as if it were an upper garment,

22\. Nor with warm water,

23\. Nor with foamy water,

24\. And in no case wearing sandals,

25. <span id="fr_111"></span>[25](#fn_111) (Not) with a turban on his
head (?),

26\. (Not with his garment) tied round his neck,

27\. And not stretching out his feet.

28. <span id="fr_112"></span>[28](#fn_112) When he has finally touched
(water) again, he becomes pure.

29. <span id="fr_113"></span>[29](#fn_113) Let him, however, sip only
water that reaches his heart.

30\. For if he does otherwise, he remains impure.

31\. Now the cases in which he has to touch (water) a second time.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

32. <span id="fr_114"></span>[32](#fn_114) Having slept, or eaten, or
sneezed, or taken a bath, or drunk something, or changed (his garments),
or walked on the high road, or gone to a cemetery, he should sip water
and then sip water again.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_106"></span>[16:1](sbe30005.htm#fr_106) 2, 1-4. Rules
regarding the Upavîta. Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 1, 4-6. Compare the detailed
description of the nine threads of which the Upavîta-string should
consist, in the G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha II, 48 seqq. A string was evidently
considered as the regular and preferable form of the Upavîta; with
regard to the second kind of Upavîta mentioned in Sûtra 1, the
commentary says, 'A garment (is used), <span id="page_17">p. 17</span>
if the Upavîta has been lost, for instance, in a forest, and if it is
impossible to get a string.' A similar remark is given with reference to
the third kind of Upavîta, the rope of Ku*s*a grass.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[17:5](sbe30005.htm#fr_107) 5-32. Rules
regarding the â*k*amana and upaspar*s*ana. Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 1, 7-10;
Manu II, 60 seqq.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[18:17](sbe30005.htm#fr_108) As to the Tîrthas
(or parts of the hand) sacred to the different deities or beings, comp.
Vasish*th*a III, 64 seqq., &c. See also Manu II, 58.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[18:20](sbe30005.htm#fr_109) According to the
commentary he has to hold his hands between his knees. Comp.
*S*âṅkh.-G*ri*hya I, 10, 8. Thus the shoulders are brought forward.

<span id="fn_110"></span>[18:21](sbe30005.htm#fr_110) 21-27. These
Sûtras form three regular *S*loka hemistichs. Only at the end of the
second hemistich there is a metrical irregularity (sopânatka*h* kva*k*it
standing at the end of the verse).

<span id="fn_111"></span>[18:25](sbe30005.htm#fr_111) Kâsaktika*h*,
which the commentary explains as a compound of ka, 'the head,' and
âsaktikâ = âvesh*t*ikâ.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[18:28](sbe30005.htm#fr_112) Khâdira-G*ri*hya
I, 1, 10.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[18:29](sbe30005.htm#fr_113) In other texts
(for instance, Manu II, 62; Vasish*th*a III, 31 seqq.) it is stated that
a Brâhma*n*a should sip water that reaches his heart, a Kshatriya water
reaching his throat, a Vai*s*ya water that wets his palate; a *S*ûdra
should only touch water with his lips.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[19:32](sbe30005.htm#fr_114) This Sûtra again
forms a Sloka, though a slightly irregular Sloka.
