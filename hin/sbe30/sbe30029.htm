<p>1.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Now (follows) the <I>S</I>rava<I>n</I>&acirc; ceremony.</p>  
<p>2. It has to be performed on the full-moon day (of the month <I>S</I>r&acirc;va<I>n</I>a).</p>  
<p>3. Having besmeared (a surface) to the east of the house (with cow-dung), they carry forward (to that place) fire taken from the (sacred) domestic fire.</p>  
<p>4. He besmears four spots to the four sides (of the fire),</p>  
<p>5. Towards the (four) directions,</p>  
<p>6. (To the extent) of more than one prakrama (i.e. step).</p>  
<p>7. He puts a dish on the fire and fries (in that</p>

<p><A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A></p>  
<p>dish) one handful of barley-grains, without burning them.</p>  
<p>8.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> To the west of the fire he places a mortar so that it stands firmly, and husks (the grains), separating (the husked and the unhusked grains?).</p>  
<p>9. After he has carefully ground them to flour, and has thrown (that) into a wooden cup (<I>k</I>amasa), and covered it with a winnowing-basket, he puts it up (in the house).</p>  
<p>10. Between (the besmeared surface) towards the south, and that towards the east (there should be) a passage.</p>  
<p>11.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> After sunset he takes the wooden cup, (the spoon called) Darvi, and the winnowing-basket, and goes to (the fire) which has been carried forward (S&ucirc;tra 3).</p>  
<p>12. He throws the flour into the winnowing-basket and fills the wooden cup with water.</p>  
<p>13. He takes once a quantity of flour with the Darvi spoon, pours out water on the besmeared place to the east (of the fire), and offers (there) a Bali with (the words), 'O king of Serpents, dwelling towards the east, this is thy Bali!' (MB. II, 1, 1).</p>  
<p>14. He pours the rest of the water over (that Bali, taking care) that it does not carry away the Bali.</p>

<p>15.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_320"></A><A HREF="#fn_320"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> Turning round from right to left, he besprinkles the wooden cup and the Darvi spoon, warms them, and (repeats the offering of a Bali) in the same way towards the south, towards the west, and towards the north, as the Mantra (MB. II, I, 1. 2) runs, without turning away (between the single Bali-offerings).</p>  
<p>16.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_321"></A><A HREF="#fn_321"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> After he has thrown the remnants (of flour) out of the basket into the fire, he goes to that fire which has not been carried forward.</p>  
<p>17.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_322"></A><A HREF="#fn_322"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> To the west of that fire he touches the earth with his two hands turned downwards, and murmurs the Mantra, 'Adoration to the Earth&#146;s'&#151;(MB. II, 1, 3).</p>  
<p>18. In the evening boiled rice-grains with milk (are prepared).</p>  
<p>19. Of that (milk-rice) he should make oblations with (the formulas), 'To <I>S</I>rava<I>n</I>a, to Vish<I>n</I>u, to Agni, to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, to the Vi<I>s</I>ve dev&acirc;s Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'</p>  
<p>20.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> The rest (should be performed) according to the Sth&acirc;l&icirc;p&acirc;ka rite.</p>  
<p>21. To the north of the fire he places a bunch of Darbha grass with roots, and murmurs the Mantra, 'Soma the king' (ibid. 4), and, 'The agreement which you have made' (ibid. 5).</p>

<p>22. On the following day he has flour of fried barley-grains prepared, and in a new pot, covering (it with another pot), he puts it up (in his house).</p>  
<p>23.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> (Of that flour) he should silently offer Balis day by day in the evening, before the sacrifice, until the &Acirc;grah&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc; day.</p>
