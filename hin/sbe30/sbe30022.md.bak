### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 10.

1. <span id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_249.md)  <span
id="fr_250"></span>[4](#fn_250.md) In the eighth year after the conception
let him initiate a Brâhma*n*a,

2\. In the eleventh year after the conception a Kshatriya,

3\. In the twelfth year after the conception a Vai*s*ya.

4\. Until the sixteenth year the time has not passed for a Brâhma*n*a,
until the twenty-second for a Kshatriya, until the twenty-fourth for a
Vai*s*ya.

5. <span id="fr_251"></span>[5](#fn_251) After that (time has passed.md),
they become patitasâvitrîka (i.e. they have lost their right of being
taught the Sâvitrî).

6\. Let them not initiate such men, nor teach them, nor perform
sacrifices for them, nor form matrimonial alliances with them.

7\. On the day on which the youth is going to receive the initiation, on
that day, early in the morning, they give him to eat, and have his hair
arranged, and wash him, and deck him with ornaments, and put on him a
(new) garment which has not yet been washed.

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

8. <span id="fr_252"></span>[8](#fn_252.md) Their garments are made of
linen, of hempen cloth, of cotton, or of wool (according to the caste to
which the student belongs).

9\. The skins (which they wear), are an antelope-skin, or the skin of a
spotted deer, or a goat's skin.

10. <span id="fr_253"></span>[10](#fn_253.md) Their girdles are made of
Mu*ñg*a grass, of Kâ*s*a grass, of Tâmbala.

11\. Their staffs are of Par*n*a wood, of Bilva wood, of A*s*vattha
wood.

12\. The garment of a Brâhma*n*a is made of linen, or of hempen cloth,
that of a Kshatriya, of cotton, that of a Vai*s*ya, of wool.

13. <span id="fr_254"></span>[13](#fn_254.md) Thereby also the other
articles have been explained.

14\. Or if (the proper articles prescribed) cannot be got, all (of them
may be used) by (persons of) all castes.

15. <span id="fr_255"></span>[15](#fn_255.md) To the east of the house on a
surface besmeared (with cow-dung) wood has been put on the fire.

16\. Having sacrificed with (the Mantras which the student recites)
'Agni! Lord of the vow' (MB. I, 6, 9-13), the teacher stations himself
to the west

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

of the fire, on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing the east.

17\. Between the fire and the teacher the student (stands), raising his
joined hands, turning his face towards the teacher, on northward-pointed
Darbha grass.

18\. Standing on his south side a Brâhma*n*a versed in the Mantras fills
(the student's) joined hands with water,

19\. And afterwards (those) of the teacher.

20\. Looking (at the student the teacher) murmurs (the verse), 'With him
who comes to us, we have come together' (MB. I, 6, 14).

21\. He causes (the student) to say, 'I have come hither to studentship'
(ibid. 16).

22. <span id="fr_256"></span>[22](#fn_256) In (the words.md), 'What is thy
name' (ibid. 17), he asks after his name.

23\. The teacher chooses for him a name which he is to use at respectful
salutations,

24\. (A name) derived from (the name of) a deity or a Nakshatra,

25\. Or also of his Gotra, according to some (teachers).

26\. Having let the water run out of his joined

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

hands (over the student's hands), the teacher with his right hand seizes
(the student's) right hand together with the thumb, with (the formula),
'By the impulse of the god Savit*ri*, with the arms of the two A*s*vins,
with Pûshan's hands I seize thy hand, N.N.!' (ibid. 18).

27\. He then makes him turn round from left to right with (the formula),
'Move in the sun's course after him, N.N.!' (ibid. 19).

28\. Grasping down with his right hand over his right shoulder he should
touch his uncovered navel with (the formula), 'Thou art the knot of all
breath' (ibid. 20).

29\. Raising himself (from the position implied in Sûtra 28, he should
touch) the place near the navel with (the formula), 'Ahura' (ibid. 21).

30\. Raising himself (still more, he should touch) the place of the
heart with (the formula), 'K*ris*ana' (ibid. 22).

31\. Having touched from behind with his right hand (the student's)
right shoulder with (the formula), 'I give thee in charge to
Pra*g*âpati, N.N.!' (ibid. 23)—

32\. And with his left (hand) the left (shoulder) with (the formula), 'I
give thee in charge to the god Savit*ri*, N.N.!' (ibid. 24)—

33. <span id="fr_257"></span>[33](#fn_257.md) He then directs him (to
observe the duties of Brahma*k*arya, by the formula), 'A student art
thou, N.N.!' (ibid. 25).

34\. 'Put on fuel. Eat water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the
day-time' (ibid. 26).

35\. Having gone in a northerly direction from

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

the fire, the teacher sits down to the east, on northward-pointed Darbha
grass,

36\. The student to the west, bending his right knee, turning his face
towards the teacher, also on northward-pointed Darbha grass.

37\. (The teacher) then ties round (the student) thrice from left to
right the girdle made of Mu*ñg*a grass and causes him to repeat (the
verse), 'Protecting us from evil word' (ibid. 27), and (the verse), 'The
protectress of right' (ibid. 28).

38\. Then (the student) respectfully sits down near (the teacher) with
(the words), 'Recite, sir! May the reverend one recite the Sâvitrî to
me.'

39\. He then recites (the Sâvitrî, ibid. 29) to him, Pâda by Pâda,
hemistich by hemistich, and the whole verse,

40\. And the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis one by one, with the word Om at the end
(ibid. 30).

41\. And handing over to him the staff, which should be made of (the
wood of) a tree, he causes him to repeat (the formula), 'O glorious one,
make me glorious' (ibid. 31).

42\. Then (the student) goes to beg food,

43\. First of his mother, and of two other women friends, or of as many
as there are in the neighbourhood.

44\. He announces the alms (received) to his teacher.

45\. The rest of the day he stands silently.

46\. After sunset he puts a piece of wood on the fire with (the Mantra),
'To Agni I have brought a piece of wood' (ibid. 32).

47\. Through a period of three nights he avoids eating pungent or saline
food.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

48\. At the end of that (period) a mess of boiled rice-grains (is
offered) to Savit*ri*.

49. <span id="fr_258"></span>[49](#fn_258.md) Then he may do what he likes.

50\. A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.

End of the Second Prapâ*th*aka.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_249"></span>[63:1](sbe30022.htm#fr_249.md) 10, 1 seq. The
initiation of the student. Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 4, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[63:4](sbe30022.htm#fr_250.md) 1-4. On the number
of years given for the Upanayana of persons of the three castes, see the
note on *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, I, 1.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[63:5](sbe30022.htm#fr_251.md) 5, 6. See the note
on *S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, I, 9.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[64:8](sbe30022.htm#fr_252.md) There are four
kinds of garments indicated, though only persons of three castes are
concerned. The explanation of this apparent incongruence follows from
Sûtra 12.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[64:10](sbe30022.htm#fr_253.md) Tâmbala is stated
to be a synonym for *s*a*n*a (hemp).

<span id="fn_254"></span>[64:13](sbe30022.htm#fr_254.md) As the garments
indicated in Sûtra 8 belong, in the order in which they are stated, to
persons of the three castes respectively, thus also of the skins (Sûtra
9), of the girdles (Sûtra 10), and of the staffs (Sûtra 11); the first
is that belonging to a Brâhma*n*a, the second, to a Kshatriya, and the
third, to a Vai*s*ya.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[64:15](sbe30022.htm#fr_255.md) Comp. above, chap.
9, 2.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[65:22](sbe30022.htm#fr_256.md) 22, 23. It is
evident that the words tasyâ*k*ârya*h* belong to Sûtra 23, and not to
Sûtra 22, to which the traditional division of the Sûtras assigns them.
The corresponding section of the Mantra-Brâhma*n*a runs thus: 'What is
thy name?'—'My name is N.N.!' It is not clear whether the student, being
questioned by the teacher, had to indicate his ordinary name, and then
to receive from the teacher his 'abhivâdanîya nâmadheya,' or whether he
had to pronounce, on the teacher's question, directly the abhivâdanîya
name chosen for him by the teacher. The commentary and the corresponding
passage of the Khâdira-G*ri*hya (II, 4, 12) are in favour of the second
alternative.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[66:33](sbe30022.htm#fr_257.md) 33, 34. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, 4, 5 note.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[68:49](sbe30022.htm#fr_258.md) 49, 50. Dr. Knauer
very pertinently calls attention to the fact that these Sûtras are not
repeated, as is the rule with regard to the concluding words of an
Adhyâya or Prapâ*th*aka. Comp. chap. 8, 25 note.
