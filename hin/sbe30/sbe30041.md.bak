1. <span id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_440.md) One who desires to become a
ruler among men should fast through a period of eight nights.

2\. Then he should provide a Sruva spoon, a cup (for water), and fuel,
of Udumbara wood,

3\. Should go out of the village in an easterly or in a northerly
direction, should put wood on the fire at a place where four roads meet,

4\. And should sacrifice Â*g*ya, turning his face towards the sun, with
(the formulas), 'Food indeed is the only thing that is pervaded by the
metres,' and, 'Bliss indeed' (MB. II, 6, 13. 14);

5\. A third (oblation) in the village with (the formula), 'The food's
essence is ghee' (ibid. 15).

6\. One who is desirous of cattle, (should offer this oblation) in a

7. <span id="fr_441"></span>[7](#fn_441) If (the cow-stable.md) is damaged

10\. (Let him do so with the three formulas, MB. II, 6, 13-15) with the
word Svâhâ at the end of each.

11\. This will bring a prosperous journey (to himself) and to his

15. <span id="fr_442"></span>[15](#fn_442.md) One who desires that his
means of livelihood may not be exhausted, should sacrifice in the

6, 16. 17).

16. <span id="fr_443"></span>[16](#fn_443.md) If somebody has been bitten
by a venomous animal, he should murmur (the verse), 'Do not fear, thou

17\. With (the formula), 'Strong one! Protect' (MB. II, 6, 19), a

afternoon an earth-clod taken out of a furrow, and should put it down in
the open air.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[127:1](sbe30041.htm#fr_440.md) 9, 1 seq.
Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV, 3, 10 seq.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[127:7](sbe30041.htm#fr_441.md) Perhaps we ought
to follow the commentary and to translate, 'When (the cow-stable)
becomes heated (by the fire on which he is going to sacrifice),' &c.
('gosh*th*e<sup>ऽ</sup>gnim upasamâdhâyaiva homo na kartavya*h*, kin tv
agnim upasamâdhâyâpi tâvat pratîksha*n*îya*m* yâvad gosh*th*am
upatapyamâna*m* bhavati'). I have translated *k*îvaram according to the
ordinary meaning of the word; in the commentary it is taken as
equivalent to lauha*k*ûr*n*am (copper filings).
