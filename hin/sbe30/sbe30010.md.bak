*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 7.

1\. He then washes the mortar, the pestle, and the winnowing basket,
strews to the west of the fire eastward-pointed Darbha grass, and puts
(the mortar, &c.) on (that grass).

2. <span id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_148.md) He then pours out, with a
brazen vessel or with the pot in which the oblations of cooked rice are
prepared, the grain destined for sacrifice, rice or barley—

3\. Once pronouncing the name of the deity (to whom the offering will be
made): 'Agreeable to such and such (a deity) I pour thee out;' twice (it
is done) silently.

4. <span id="fr_149"></span>[4](#fn_149.md) Then to the west, with his face
turned eastward, he begins to husk the grain, with his right hand lying
over the left.

5\. After the grain has three times been winnowed, he should wash it
thrice (if it is destined) for the gods, they say, twice, if for men,
once, if for the Fathers.

6. <span id="fr_150"></span>[6](#fn_150) Having put a (Darbha.md) purifier
(into the pot

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

in which the oblation is to be prepared), he should pour the grain (into
it).

7\. He should cook the mess of sacrificial food so that it is well
cooked, stirring it up (with the pot-ladle) from left to right.

8\. When it has been cooked, he should sprinkle (Â*g*ya) on it, should
take it from the fire towards the north, and should again sprinkle
(Â*g*ya) on it.

9\. Having put wood on the fire, he should strew Ku*s*a grass round it
on all sides, to the east, to the south, to the north, to the west—

10. <span id="fr_151"></span>[10](#fn_151.md) On all sides in three layers
or in five layers—

11. <span id="fr_152"></span>[11](#fn_152.md) Thick, so that always an
uneven number (of blades) are put together.

12\. (He should strew) eastward-pointed grass, covering the roots with
the points.

13. <span id="fr_153"></span>[13](#fn_153.md) Or he should strew it to the
west (of the fire), and should draw (some of the grass which he has
strewn) from the south end and (some) from the north end, in an easterly
direction.

14\. He should (arrange the grass so as to) lay the points of the
southern blades uppermost.

15\. This rule for strewing (grass) round (the fire is valid) for all
(ceremonies) at which oblations are made.

16. <span id="fr_154"></span>[16](#fn_154.md) Some lay also branches of
*S*amî wood or of Par*n*a wood round (the fire).

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

17\. To the north (of the fire) a Sruva full of water (is placed): this
is the Pra*n*îta water;

18\. If there is (such water). Or it may be dispensed with, say some
(teachers).

19\. Having put the mess of cooked food on the Barhis, and put wood (on
the fire), he prepares the Â*g*ya.

20. <span id="fr_155"></span>[20](#fn_155) (He may take.md) ghee, or oil
made from Tila seeds, or curds, or milk, or rice gruel.

21. <span id="fr_156"></span>[21](#fn_156.md) From that same Barhis (he
takes two Darbha blades and) makes purifiers (of them), of the length of
one span.

22\. Putting an herb between (them and the instrument with which he cuts
them), he cuts them off, not with his nail, with (the words), 'Purifiers
are ye, sacred to Vish*n*u.'

23\. He then wipes them with water, with (the words), 'By Vish*n*u's
mind ye are purified.'

24. <span id="fr_157"></span>[24](#fn_157.md) Having purified (the Â*g*ya
by pouring it into the Â*g*ya pot, over which he has laid a Darbha
purifier), he purifies it (in the pot) with the two northward-pointed
purifiers (in the following way):

25\. Holding them with his two thumbs and fourth fingers, he purifies
(the Â*g*ya) three times, from west to east, once with the Ya*g*us: 'May
the god Savit*ri* purify thee with this uninjured purifier, with the
rays of the good sun;' twice silently.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

26\. He then should sprinkle them with water and should throw them into
the fire.

27\. Then, having put that Â*g*ya on the fire, he should take it from
(the fire) towards the north.

28\. This is the way to prepare the Â*g*ya.
