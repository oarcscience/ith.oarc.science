4\. Spring, summer, autumn: these are the (fit) seasons (for the
Upanayana), corresponding to the order of the castes.

5\. (The boy's father) serves food to Brâhma*n*as and causes them to
pronounce auspicious wishes, and serves food to the boy. (The teacher?)
pours together, with the first Ya*g*us (of the next Anuvâka, warm and
cold) water, pouring the warm water into the cold, and moistens (the
boy's) head with the next (verse; M. II, 1, 2).

6. <span id="fr_755"></span>[6](#fn_755) Having put three Darbha blades
into his hair (towards each of the four directions) (the teacher \[?\])
shaves his hair with the next four (verses; M. II, 1, 3-6) with the
different Mantras, towards the different (four) directions.

7. <span id="fr_756"></span>[7](#fn_756) With the following (verse, M.
II, 1, 7, somebody) addresses him while he is shaving.

8\. Towards the south, his mother or a Brahma*k*ârin strews
barley-grains on a lump of bull's dung; with this (dung) she catches up
the hair (that is cut off), and puts it down with the next (verse; M.
II, 1, 8) at the root of an Udumbara tree or in a tuft of Darbha grass.

9. <span id="fr_757"></span>[9](#fn_757) After (the boy) has bathed, and
(the ceremonies) from the putting (of wood) on (the fire) down to the
Â*g*yabhâga oblations (have been performed), he causes him to put a
piece of Palâ*s*a wood on the

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

fire with the next (verse; M. II, 2, 1), and makes him tread with his
right foot on a stone to the north of the fire, with (the verse),
'Tread' (M. II, 2, 2).

10\. Having recited the next two (verses; M. II. 2, 3. 4) over a garment
that has been spun and woven on one day, and has caused him, with the
next three (verses; M. II. 2, 5-7), to put it on, he recites over him,
after he has put it on, the next (verse; M. II, 2, 8).

11. <span id="fr_758"></span>[11](#fn_758) He ties thrice around him,
from left to right, a threefold-twisted girdle of Mu*ñg*a grass with the
next two (verses; M. II. 2, 9. 10), and (gives him) a skin as his outer
garment with the next (verse; II, 2, 11).

12. <span id="fr_759"></span>[12](#fn_759) To the north of the fire (the
teacher) spreads out Darbha grass; on that he causes (the boy) to
station himself with the next (verse; M. II. 3, 1), pours his joined
hands full of water into (the boy's) joined hands, makes him sprinkle
himself three times with the next (verse; M. II, 3, 2), takes hold of
his right hand with the next (formulas; M. II, 3, 3-12), gives him with

and murmurs into his right ear the (Mantra), 'Blessed with offspring'
(II, 3, 25).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_755"></span>[271:6](sbe30103.htm#fr_755) 10, 6, 7. The
difference which Haradatta makes between the teacher who begins to shave
him (pravapati) and the barber who goes on with shaving (vapantam) seems
too artificial.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[271:7](sbe30103.htm#fr_756) Haradatta: The
teacher addresses the barber, &c.—Sudar*s*anârya: The mother of the boy
or a Brahma*k*ârin \[comp. Sûtra 8\] . . . addresses the teacher who
shaves him.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[271:9](sbe30103.htm#fr_757) Comp. above, II,
4, 3.
