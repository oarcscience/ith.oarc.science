*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 5.

1. <span id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_308) From that time he shall assume
a dignified demeanour: this is in short the rule (for his behaviour).

2\. Here the teachers enumerate the following (regulations).

3\. Nâ*g*âtalomnyopahâsam i*kkh*et.

4\. Nor (should he wish for sport) with a girl who is the only child of
her mother,

5\. Nor with a woman during her courses,

6\. Nor with one who descends from the same *Ri*shis.

7\. Let him not eat food which has been brought by another door (than
the usual),

8\. Or which has been cooked twice,

9\. Or which has stood over night—

10\. Except such as is prepared of vegetables, flesh, barley, or flour.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

11\. Let him not run while it is raining.

12\. Let him not take himself his shoes in his hands (when putting them
on or pulling them off).

13\. Let him not look into a well.

14\. Let him not gather fruits himself.

15\. He should not wear a scentless wreath,

16\. If it is not a wreath of gold.

17\. (He should not wear a wreath) of which the expression mâlâ
(garland) has been used.

18\. He should cause the people to call it sra*g* (wreath). (Then he may
wear it.)

19\. He should avoid using the word bhadra ('blessed') without a reason.

20. <span id="fr_309"></span>[20](#fn_309) He should say (instead of
it), mandra ('lovely').

21. <span id="fr_310"></span>[21](#fn_310) There are three (kinds of)
Snâtakas:

22\. A Vidyâsnâtaka (or a Snâtaka by knowledge), a Vratasnâtaka (or a
Snâtaka by the completion of his vow), and a Vidyâvratasnâtaka (i.e.
Snâtaka by both).

23\. Of these the last ranks foremost; the two others are equal (to each
other).

24\. (A Snâtaka) should not put on a wet garment.

25. <span id="fr_311"></span>[25](#fn_311) He should not wear one
garment.

26\. He should not praise any person (excessively).

27\. He should not speak of what he has not seen, as if he had seen it,

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

28\. Nor of what he has not heard, as if he had heard it.

29\. He should give up everything that forms an impediment for his
Veda-recitation.

30\. He should endeavour to keep himself (pure from every defilement)
like a pot of oil.

31\. He should not climb a tree.

32\. He should not go toward evening to another village,

33. <span id="fr_312"></span>[33](#fn_312) Nor alone,

34\. Nor together with V*ri*shalas (or *S*ûdras).

35\. He should not enter the village by a by-path.

36\. And he should not walk without a companion.

37\. These are the. observances for those who have performed the
Samâvartana,

38. <span id="fr_313"></span>[38](#fn_313) And what (besides) is
prescribed by *S*ish*t*as.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_308"></span>[85:1](sbe30027.htm#fr_308) 5, 1 seq. Rules of
conduct for the Snâtaka; comp. Khâdira-G*ri*hya III, I, 33 seq.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[86:20](sbe30027.htm#fr_309) As to the reading,
comp. Dr. Knauer's remarks in his edition of the text, p. xi of the
Introduction.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[86:21](sbe30027.htm#fr_310) 21, 22. These
Sûtras are identical with Pâraskara II, 5, 32. Comp. the definitions of
these three kinds of Snâtakas, Pâraskara, l.l. 33-35.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[86:25](sbe30027.htm#fr_311) Comp. above, chap.
2, 58.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[87:33](sbe30027.htm#fr_312) That the Snâtaka
is not allowed to go alone to another village, follows from Sacra 36;
thus Sûtra 33 is superfluous. The commentator of course tries to defend
Gobhila, but I think he has not succeeded. Probably Gobhila has taken
the two Sûtras from different texts on which his own composition seems
to be based.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[87:38](sbe30027.htm#fr_313) Baudhâyana I, 1, 6
(S.B.E. XIV, 144): 'Those are called *S*ish*t*as who, in accordance with
the sacred law, have studied the Veda together with its appendages, know
how to draw inferences from that, and are able to adduce proofs
perceptible by the senses from the revealed texts.'
