### PRAPÂ*TH*AKA II, KÂ*ND*IKÂ 1.

1. <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_185.md) Under a propitious Nakshatra
let him take a wife—

2. <span id="fr_186"></span>[2](#fn_186.md) Who should possess the
auspicious characteristics in due way.

3\. If he can find no such (woman, he should take) earth-clods—

4. <span id="fr_187"></span>[4](#fn_187.md) From an altar, a furrow, a
pool, a cow-stable, a place where four roads meet, a gambling-place, a
place where corpses are burnt, and from sterile soil;

5\. A ninth (earth-clod) mixed of all.

6\. (These he should make) equal (and should) make marks at them.

7. <span id="fr_188"></span>[7](#fn_188.md) Taking them in his hand he
should offer them to the girl, and (reciting the formula): 'Right alone
is the first; right nobody oversteps; on right this earth is founded.
May N.N. become this universe!'—he should pronounce her name and should
say: 'Take one of these.'

8\. If she takes one of the first four (clods), he should marry her,

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

9. <span id="fr_189"></span>[9](#fn_189.md) And according to some
(teachers) also, if (she takes) the mixed one.

10. <span id="fr_190"></span>[10](#fn_190.md) After she has been washed
with Klîtaka, barley and beans, a friend should besprinkle her three
times at her head, so that her whole body becomes wet, with Surâ of
first quality, with (the formula), 'Kâma! I know thy name. Intoxication
thou art by name,' &c. (Mantra-Brâhma*n*a I, 1, 2). (In the passage of
the formula), 'Bring hither N.N.,' he should pronounce the husband's
name. (The Mantras should have) the word Svâhâ at their end. With the
two following verses he should wash her private parts.

11\. That has to be done by (female) relatives (of the bride).

12\. At the wedding wood has been put on the fire to the east of the
house, on a surface besmeared (with cow-dung).

13. <span id="fr_191"></span>[13](#fn_191.md) Then one of the people who
assist at the wedding, fills a cup with 'firm' water, and having walked
with the water-pot round the fire on its front side, silent, wrapped in
his robe, he stations himself to the south (of the fire), facing the
north

14\. Another person with a goad (walks in the same way and stations
himself in the same place).

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

15\. They place roasted grain mixed with *S*amî leaves, to the amount of
four handfuls, in a winnowing basket behind the fire,

16\. And an upper mill-stone.

17. <span id="fr_192"></span>[17](#fn_192) Now (the girl.md) whose hand he
is going to seize, has been washed, (her whole body) including her head.

18\. The husband should put on her a (new) garment which has not yet
been washed, with the verse, 'They who spun' (Mantra-Brâhma*n*a I, 1,
5), and with (the verse), 'Put on her, dress her' (l.l. 6).

19\. Leading forward (from the house to the sacred fire, the bride) who
is wrapped in her robe and wears the sacrificial cord over her left
shoulder, he should murmur (the verse), 'Soma gave her to the Gandharva'
(MB. I, 1, 7).

20. <span id="fr_193"></span>[20](#fn_193.md) While she, to the west of the
fire, pushes forward with her foot a rush-mat or something else of that
kind, veiled (with clothes), he should make her say: 'May the way which
my husband goes, be open to me.'

21\. If she does not murmur (these words out of shame, &c.), he should
murmur (them, saying), 'To her' (instead of 'To me').

22\. She should make the end of the rush-mat (Sûtra 20) reach the end of
the Barhis.

23\. On the east end of the rush-mat she sits down to the right of the
bridegroom.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

24. <span id="fr_194"></span>[24](#fn_194.md) While she touches his right
shoulder with her right hand, he sacrifices six oblations of Â*g*ya with
(the verse), 'May Agni go as the first,' and the following (verses) (MB.
I, 1, 9-14)—

25\. And (three oblations) with the Mahâvyâh*ri*tis, one by one;

26\. A fourth with (the four Mahâvyâh*ri*tis) together.

of the wedding. Comp. Indische Studien, V, 288, 305 seq.; 312 seq.; 368
seq.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[42:2](sbe30013.htm#fr_186.md) In translating
ku*s*alena I have been guided by the comparison of I, 5, 26 (comp.
Böhtlingk-Roth, s.v. ku*s*ala). The commentary understands the Sûtra in
a different way. He should take a woman who possesses auspicious
characteristics commended by one versed (ku*s*ala) in the
characteristics of women. If he can find no such person who is able to
judge, he should, &c. (Sûtra 3).

<span id="fn_187"></span>[42:4](sbe30013.htm#fr_187.md) Comp.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[43:9](sbe30013.htm#fr_189.md) See Sûtra 5.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[43:10](sbe30013.htm#fr_190.md) 'With Klîtaka,'
&c., means, with water into which Klîtaka, &c., has been thrown; comp.
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha II, 15. 'Surâ of first quality' is Surâ prepared
from molasses; see G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha II, 16. Comp., however, also
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha II, 41.

I, 3, 5; G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha II, 25. 26. 'Firm water' seems to be water
which does not dry up. The G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha says: 'Water that has its
smell, its colour, and its taste, which is in great rivers, in wells and
other receptacles, and in ponds: such water is called "firm;" this is
the fixed meaning.' Comp. Bloomfield's note, Z.D.M.G. XXXV, 574.

Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 3, 6. Ya*gñ*opavîtinîm in Sûtra 19 means, according
to the commentary, that she wears her outer garment arranged like the
sacrificial cord, over her left shoulder; for women are not allowed to
wear the sacrificial cord itself.
