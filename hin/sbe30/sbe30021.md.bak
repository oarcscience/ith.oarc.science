### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 9.

1. <span id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_241.md) Now follows the tonsure of the
child's head, in the third year.

2. <span id="fr_242"></span>[2](#fn_242.md) To the east of the house on a
surface besmeared (with cow-dung) wood has been put on the fire.

3\. There the following things have been placed:

4\. To the south (of the fire) twenty-one Darbha blades, a brass vessel
with hot water, a razor of Udumbara wood or a mirror, and a barber with
a razor in his hand;

5. <span id="fr_243"></span>[5](#fn_243.md) To the north, bull's dung and a
mess of boiled rice with sesamum seeds which may be more or less cooked.

6. <span id="fr_244"></span>[6](#fn_244.md) Let them fill vessels
separately with rice and barley, with sesamum seeds and beans, and let
them place (those vessels) to the east (of the fire).

7\. The boiled rice with sesamum seeds (Sutra 5) and all seeds
(mentioned in Sûtra 6) are given to the barber.

8\. Then the mother, having dressed the son in a clean garment, sits
down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass, facing
the east.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

9\. To the west (of her), facing the east, the person stations himself
who is going to perform that (ceremony).

10\. He then murmurs, fixing his thoughts on Savit*ri*, looking at the
barber, (the Mantra), 'Hither has come Savit*ri* with his razor' (MB. I,
6. 1).

11. <span id="fr_245"></span>[11](#fn_245.md) And fixing his thoughts on
Vâyu, looking at the brass vessel with warm water, (he murmurs the
Mantra), 'With warm water, O Vâyu, come hither' (ibid. 2).

12\. Drawing water (out of that vessel) with his right hand he moistens
the patch of hair on the right side (of the boy's head) with (the
Mantra), 'May the waters moisten thee for life' (ibid. 3).

13\. With (the Mantra), 'Vish*n*u's tusk art thou' (ibid. 4) he looks at
the razor of Udumbara wood or at the mirror.

14\. With (tile Mantra), 'Herb! Protect him!' (ibid. 5) he puts seven
Darbha blades, with their points turned towards (the boy's) head, into
the patch of hair on the right side of his head.

15\. Pressing them down with his left hand, and seizing with his right
hand the razor of Udumbara wood or the mirror, he touches with it (the
Darbha blades), with the (Mantra), 'Axe! Do no harm to him!' (ibid. 6).

16\. With (the Mantra), 'With which Pûshan has shaven B*ri*haspati's
head' (ibid. 7), he moves forward (that razor or the mirror) three times
towards the east without cutting (the hair); once with the Ya*g*us,
twice silently.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

17\. Then (the barber) with the razor of metal cuts the hair and throws
(the cut off hair ends) on the bull's dung.

18\. In the same way (after the same rites have been performed), he cuts
the patch of hair on the back-side;

19\. And that on the left side.

20. <span id="fr_246"></span>[20](#fn_246.md) He should repeat (when going
to cut the hair on the back-side, and then again on the left side, the
rites stated above), beginning from the moistening of the hair (Sûtra
12).

21\. Grasping with his two hands (the boy) round his head he should
murmur (the verse), 'The threefold age of *G*amadagni' (MB. I, 6, 8).

22\. In the same way (the rites are performed) for a girl,

23\. (But) silently.

24. <span id="fr_247"></span>[24](#fn_247.md) The sacrifice, however, (is
performed) with the Mantra.

25. <span id="fr_248"></span>[25](#fn_248.md) Walking away from the fire in
a northerly direction they have the arrangement of (the boy's) hair made
according to the custom of his Gotra and of his family.

26\. They throw the hair on the bull's dung (mentioned above), take it
to the forest, and bury it.

27\. Some throw them on a bunch (of grass or the like).

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

28\. Then they may do what they like.

29\. A cow constitutes the sacrificial fee.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_241"></span>[60:1](sbe30021.htm#fr_241.md) 9, 1. The
*K*û*d*âkara*n*a. Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 3, 16 seq. On the literal meaning
of *K*û*d*âkarana, see *S*âṅkhâyana I, 28, 1 note.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[60:2](sbe30021.htm#fr_242.md) Comp. above, II, 1,
13.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[60:5](sbe30021.htm#fr_243.md) Comp. above, chap.
7, 9; G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha II, 39.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[60:6](sbe30021.htm#fr_244.md) I believe that four
vessels were filled, one with rice, one with barley, one with sesamum
seeds, and one with beans. The Dvandva compounds vrîhiyavais and
tilamâshais cannot justify the conclusion that one vessel was filled
with rice and barley mixed, and another with sesamum seeds and beans,
for the plural pâtrâ*n*i shows that there were more than two vessels.
Â*s*valâyana I, 17, 2, says, vrîhiyavamâshatilânâ*m* p*ri*thak
pûr*n*a*s*arâvâ*n*i.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[61:11](sbe30021.htm#fr_245.md) I have translated
the Mantra according to the reading of Â*s*valâyana (G*ri*hya I; 17, 6)
and Pâraskara (II, 1, 6): ush*n*ena Vâya udakenehi. Gobhila has
udakenaidhi.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[62:20](sbe30021.htm#fr_246.md) Thus on the
back-side seven Darbha blades are put into the hair, and on the left
side seven. This makes, together with the seven blades put into the hair
on the right side (Sûtra 14), twenty-one, the number stated in Sûtra 4.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[62:24](sbe30021.htm#fr_247.md) In the description
of the Kû*d*âkara*n*a given in this chapter no sacrifice is mentioned.
See, however, I, 9, 28.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[62:25](sbe30021.htm#fr_248.md)
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha II, 40.
