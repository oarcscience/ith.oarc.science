### PA*T*ALA 7, SECTION 24.

1\. 'Agni! Expiation! Thou art expiation. I, the Brâhma*n*a, entreat
thee, desirous of protection. What is terrible in her, drive that away
from here. Svâhâ!

'Vâyu! Expiation! Thou art expiation. I, the Brâhma*n*a, entreat thee,
desirous of protection. What is blameful in her, drive that away from
here. Svâhâ!

'Sun! Expiation! Thou art expiation. I, the Brâhma*n*a, entreat thee,
desirous of protection. What dwells in her that is death-bringing to her
husband, drive that away from here. Svâhâ!

'Sun! Expiation! &c.

'Vâyu! Expiation! &c.

'Agni! Expiation! &c.

'Agni! Expiation! &c.

'Vâyu! Expiation! &c.

2\. Having sacrificed (these oblations), he then pours the remainder as
an oblation on her head, with (the formulas), 'Bhû*h*! I sacrifice
fortune over thee. Svâhâ! Bhuva*h*! I sacrifice glory over thee. Svâhâ!
Suva*h*! I sacrifice beauty over thee. Svâhâ! Bhûr bhuva*h* suva*h*! I
sacrifice brightness over thee. Svâhâ!'

3\. There (near the sacrificial fire) he places a water-pot, walks round
the fire (and that water-pot) keeping his right side turned towards it,
makes (the wife) lie down to the west of the fire, facing east or north,
and touches her secret parts, with (the formula), 'We touch thee with
the five-forked, auspicious, unhostile (?), thousandfoldly blessed,
glorious hand that thou mayst be rich in offspring!'

4\. He then cohabits with her with (the formula), 'United is our soul,
united our hearts, united our navel, united our skin. I will bind thee
with the bond of love; that shall be insoluble.'

5\. He then embraces her with (the formula), 'Be devoted to me; be my
companion. What dwells in thee that is death-bringing to thy husband,
that I make death-bringing to thy paramours. Bring luck to me; be a
sharp-cutting (destroyer) to thy paramours.'

6. <span id="fr_629"></span>[6](#fn_629.md) He then seeks her mouth with
his mouth, with (the two verses), 'Honey! Lo! Honey! This is honey! my
tongue's speech is honey; in my mouth dwells the honey of the bee; on my
teeth dwells concord.

'The (magic charm of) concord that belongs to the *k*akravâka birds,
that is brought out of the

rivers, of which the divine Gandharva is possessed, thereby we are
concordant.'

7. <span id="fr_630"></span>[7](#fn_630.md) A woman that has her monthly
courses, keeps through a period of three nights the observances
prescribed in the Brâhma*n*a.

8\. In the fourth night (the husband) having sipped water, calls (the
wife) who has taken a bath, who wears a clean dress and ornaments, and
has spoken with a Brâhma*n*a, to himself (with the following verses):
