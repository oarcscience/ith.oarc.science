# ÂPASTAMBA'S YA*GÑ*A-PARIBHÂSHÂ-SÛTRAS. (*cont*.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_26">26</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXVI.

If the *g*uhû has been elsewhere employed, let it be done with a ladle
(sruva).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_26_c">26<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The *g*uhû is a sru*k*, a spoon, the sruva, a ladle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_27">27</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXVII.

The offering is made in the Âhavanîya fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28">28</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXVIII.

The sacrificial vessels are kept from the first laying of the fires
(âdhâna) for the whole life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_28_c">28<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

All sacrificial vessels and instruments are to be kept, and most of them
are burnt with the sacrificer at his death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_29">29</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXIX.

At every sacrifice these vessels are to be purified.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_30">30</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXX.

The rule for the sacrifice are the Mantras and Brâhma*n*as.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_31">31</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXXI.

The name Veda belongs both to the Mantras and Brâhma*n*as.

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_32">32</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXXII.

The Brâhma*n*as are the precepts for the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33">33</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXXIII.

The rest of the Brâhma*n*a, that which does not contain precepts,
consists of explanations, i.e. reproof, praise, stories, and traditions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_33_c">33<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

It is difficult to find words corresponding to technical terms in
Sanskrit. Arthavâda, which I have translated by explanation, means not
only the telling of the meaning, but likewise the telling of the object;
parak*ri*ti, story, means literally the action of another; purâkalpa,
traditions, means the former state. The difference between the two is
stated to be that parak*ri*ti refers to the act of one person, purâkalpa
to that of several. This subject is fully treated in the
Pûrva-mîmâ*m*sâ. Satyavrata begins a new Sûtra with 'reproof' (nindâ).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_34">34</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXXIV.

All the rest are Mantras.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_35">35</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXXV.

But passages which are not handed down, are not to be classed as
Mantras, as, for instance, the pravara, the words used in choosing
priests, divine or human; ûha, substitution of one word for another; and
nâmadheya-graha*n*a, the mentioning of the names of particular
sacrificers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_35_c">35<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The reason why such passages are not to be treated as Mantras is that
they should not be subject to some of the preceding rules, as, for
instance, the murmuring, enjoined in Sûtra IX. Those passages naturally
vary in each sacrifice. With regard to the names a distinction is made

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

between the gârhyam nâma, the domestic name of a person, such as
Ya*gñ*a*s*arman, and the astrological name, such as Rauhi*n*a, derived
from the star Rohi*n*î.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36">36</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXXVI.

Likewise the sound of a carriage and the sound of a drum.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_36_c">36<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

These sounds, though serving for the sacrifice, are not to be considered
as liable to the rules given for the recitation of Mantras.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_37">37</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXXVII.

The prohibition of reciting Mantras in the Svâdhyâya does not apply to
the sacrifice, because there is then a different object.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_37_c">37<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Svâdhyâya, i.e. self-reading, is the name given to the study of the
Veda, both in first learning and in afterwards repeating it. This study
is under several restrictions, but these restrictions cease when the
Veda is used for sacrificial purposes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38">38</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXXVIII.

Sacrificial acts are accompanied by one Mantra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_38_c">38<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

If it is said that the priest cuts the plants with fourteen verses, that
means that there are fourteen plants to be cut and that one verse is
used for each plant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39">39</span></span>

### SÛTRA XXXIX.

This applies also to sacrificial acts which have a number and are to be
carried out by separate (repeated) acts.

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_39_c">39<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

If a rule is given, such as tri*h* prokshati, he sprinkles thrice, the
mantra which accompanies the act, is recited once only. Again in the
case of acts that require repetitions, such as rubbing, pounding, &c.,
the hymns are recited once only.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40">40</span></span>

### SÛTRA XL.

The same applies to rubbing, sleeping, crossing a river, down-pours of
rain, the conjuring of unlucky omens, unless they happened some time
ago.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_40_c">40<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

If several members of the body are to be rubbed, the verses required for
the purpose are recited once only. A prayer is enjoined if one wakes
during the night. If one wakes more than once that prayer is. not to be
repeated. In crossing a river the necessary verse is not to be repeated
at every wave, nor during a down-pour, at every drop of rain. If some
unlucky sight has to be conjured, the conjuring verse is spoken once and
not repeated, unless some time has elapsed and a new unlucky sight
presents itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41">41</span></span>

### SÛTRA XLI.

In case of a journey, however, one hymn is used till the object (of the
journey) has been accomplished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_41_c">41<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

I read prayâ*n*e tu-â-arthanirv*ri*tte*h*. Another reading is
arthani*v*ritti*h*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_42">42</span></span>

### SÛTRA XLII.

It is the same also with regard to acts which do not produce an
immediate effect.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_42_c">42<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The commentators distinguish between acts which

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

produce a visible effect, such as pounding or sprinkling, and acts which
do not, such as addressing, approaching, looking. The latter are called
asa*m*nipâtin. Thus when the stones used for the preparation of Soma are
addressed, the hymn which is used for addressing them, is not repeated
for each single stone, the same as in Sûtra XL. Sûtras XLI and XLII are
sometimes joined.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43">43</span></span>

### SÛTRA XLIII.

Repetition takes place in the case of the Havishk*ri*t, Adhrigu,
Puronuvâkyâ, and Manotâ hymns, (because they have to be used) at
different times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_43_c">43<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Havishk*ri*t-adhrigu-puronuvâkyâ-manotam is to be taken as a Dvandva
compound.

The Havishk*ri*t hymn is an invocation when the havis is made. The
Adhrigu hymn is 'Daivyâ*h* *s*amitâra*h*,' &c. The Puronuvâkyâ hymn is
that which precedes the Yâ*g*yâ, immediately after the Sampraisha. The
Manotâ hymn is 'Tva*m* hy agne prathamo manotâ,' &c. These hymns are to
be repeated, if the act which they accompany has to be repeated after a
certain interval.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_44">44</span></span>

### SÛTRA XLIV.

When it is expressly stated, one sacrificial act may be accompanied by
many hymns.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_44_c">44<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Thus we read, 'He takes the Abhri, the hoe, with four Mantras.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45">45</span></span>

### SÛTRA XLV.

One ought to let the beginnings of a sacrificial act coincide with the
end of the Mantras.

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_45_c">45<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The mantra which indicates the nature and purpose of a sacrificial act
should come first, and as soon as it has been finished the act should
follow. See Katy. I, 3, 5.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_46">46</span></span>

### SÛTRA XLVI.

In the case of the âghâra, sprinkling of clarified butter, and of dhârâ,
pouring out of Soma, the beginning of the mantra and the act takes place
at the same time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_47">47</span></span>

### SÛTRA XLVII.

Mantras are indicated by their first words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_47_c">47<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

These first words are often called Pratîkas, and rules are given in
Â*s*valâyana's *S*rauta-sûtras I, 1, 17-19, as to the number of words
that should form such a pratîka, if it is meant for one verse, for three
verses, or for a whole hymn. According to Â*s*valâyana, if one foot is
quoted, it is meant for a verse; if an imperfect foot of an initial
verse is quoted, it is meant for a whole hymn; if more than a foot is
quoted, it is meant for three verses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_48">48</span></span>

### SÛTRA XLVIII.

One should know that with the beginning of a following mantra, the
former mantra is finished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_49">49</span></span>

### SÛTRA XLIX.

In the case of Hotrâ and Yâ*g*amâna-mantras, an aggregation takes place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_49_c">49<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Hotrâs are mantras recited by the Hot*ri*-priest. Yâ*g*amânâs are
mantras recited by the sacrificer himself. They are hymns which
accompany, but do not enjoin any sacrificial act.

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50">50</span></span>

### SÛTRA L.

In the case of the Yâ*g*yâs and Anuvâkyâs this (the aggregation) is
optional.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_50_c">50<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Yâ*g*yâ is explained by praya*kkh*ati yâ*g*yayâ, the Anuvâkyâ by
âhvayaty anuvâkyayâ. Sometimes more than one are mentioned, but in that
case the priest is free to do as he likes. According to the same
principle, when we read that one should sacrifice with rice or with
barley, that means that rice should be used after the rice-harvest,
barley after the barley-harvest, and not that rice and barley should be
used at the same time.
