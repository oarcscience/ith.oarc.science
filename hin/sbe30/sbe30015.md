*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 3.

1. <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_202.md) To a convenient house of a
Brâhma*n*a, which is situated in a north-easterly direction.

2\. There wood has been put on the (nuptial) fire.

3. <span id="fr_203"></span>[3](#fn_203.md) To the west of the fire a red
bull's hide has been spread out, with the neck to the east and with the
hair outside.

4\. On that they make the woman, who has to keep silence, sit down.

5\. And (there) she remains sitting until the stars appear.

6\. When (somebody) has said that a star has appeared, (the husband)
sacrifices six oblations of Â*g*ya with the (six verses) commencing with
(the verse), 'In the junctions of the lines' (l.l. I, 3, 1-6).

7\. The remnants of each oblation he should pour out over the bride's
head.

8\. After the sacrifice they arise, go out (of the house), and he shows
her the 'firm star' (i.e. the polar-star).

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

9\. (Repeating the formula): 'Firm art thou. May I, N.N., become firm in
the house of N.N., my husband'—she should pronounce her husband's and
her own name.

10. <span id="fr_204"></span>[10](#fn_204.md) And (he shows her besides the
star) Arundhatî.

11. <span id="fr_205"></span>[11](#fn_205) (She says): 'I (N.N..md) am held
fast,' &c., as above (Sûtra 9).

12\. He then addresses her with the verse, 'Firm is the sky' (MB. I, 3,
7).

13. <span id="fr_206"></span>[13](#fn_206.md) After she has been addressed
(thus), she respectfully calls her Guru by his Gotra name.

14. <span id="fr_207"></span>[14](#fn_207.md) Thus she breaks her silence.

15\. From that time through a period of three nights they should both
avoid eating saline or pungent food, and should sleep together on the
ground without having conjugal intercourse.

16. <span id="fr_208"></span>[16](#fn_208.md) Here, they say, an Argha
reception (should be offered to the young husband).

17\. Some say (that this reception should be offered) when (the
bridegroom and his companions) have arrived (at the house of the bride's
father).

18. <span id="fr_209"></span>[18](#fn_209.md) The first food which he eats,
should be food

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

fit for sacrifice, over which he has murmured (the verses quoted in
Sûtra 21).

19\. Or he should prepare on the following day a mess of cooked food, of
which they eat together.

20\. The deities to whom it belongs, are, Agni, Pra*g*âpati, the Vi*s*ve
devâs, and Anumati.

21\. Having taken that food out (of the vessel in which it is), and
having spread it out, he should touch one part of it with his hand, with
(the verses), 'With the tie of food, with the jewel' (MB. I, 3, 8-10).

22. <span id="fr_210"></span>[22](#fn_210.md) After he has eaten, and has
given the rest to the wife, (they may do) what they like.

23. <span id="fr_211"></span>[23](#fn_211.md) A cow is the sacrificial fee.
