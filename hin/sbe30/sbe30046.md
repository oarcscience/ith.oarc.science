### PA*T*ALA 1, SECTION 3.

1\. This is the rite for all Darvi-sacrifices.

2. <span id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_478) At the end of the Mantras
constantly the word Svâhâ (is pronounced).

3. <span id="fr_479"></span>[3](#fn_479) (Oblations) for which no
Mantras are prescribed (are made merely with the words), 'To such and
such (a deity) svâhâ!'—according to the deity (to whom the oblation is
made).

4. <span id="fr_480"></span>[4](#fn_480) He sacrifices with the
Vyâh*ri*tis, 'Bhû*h*! Bhuva*h*! Suva*h*!'—with the single (three
Vyâh*ri*tis) and with (the three) together.

5. <span id="fr_481"></span>[5](#fn_481) (The Mantras for the two chief
oblations are), the (verse), 'Life-giving, Agni!' (Taitt. Brâhma*n*a I,
2, 1, 11), (and),

'Life-giving, O god, choosing long life, thou whose face is full of
ghee, whose back is full of ghee, Agni, drinking ghee, the noble
ambrosia that comes from the cow, lead this (boy) to old age, as a
father (leads) his son. Svâhâ!'

6\. (Then follow oblations with the verses),

'This, O Varu*n*a' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. II, 1, 11, 6),

'For this I entreat thee' (Taitt. Sa*m*h., loc. cit.),

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

'Thou, Agni' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. II, 5, 12, 3),

'Thus thou, Agni' (Taitt. Sa*m*h., loc. cit.),

'Thou, Agni, art quick. Being quick, appointed (by us) in our mind (as
our messenger), thou who art quick, earnest the offering (to the gods).
O quick one, bestow medicine on us! Svâhâ!'—(and finally) the (verse),

'Pra*g*âpati!' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 8, 14, 2).

7. <span id="fr_482"></span>[7](#fn_482) (With the verse), 'What I have
done too much in this sacrifice, or what I have done here deficiently,
all that may Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t, he who knows it, make well sacrificed
and well offered for me. To Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t, the offerer of
well-offered (sacrifices), the offerer of everything, to him who makes
us succeed in our offerings and in our wishes, svâhâ!'—he offers (the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation) over the easterly part of the northerly part
(of the fire), separated from the other oblations.

8. <span id="fr_483"></span>[8](#fn_483) Here some add as subordinate
oblations, before the Svish*t*ak*ri*t, the *G*aya, Abhyâtâna, and
Râsh*t*rabh*ri*t (oblations).

9. <span id="fr_484"></span>[9](#fn_484) The *G*aya (oblations) he
sacrifices with (the thirteen Mantras), 'Thought, svâhâ! Thinking,
svâhâ!'—or, 'To thought svâhâ! To thinking svâhâ!' (&c.);

10. <span id="fr_485"></span>[10](#fn_485) The Abhyâtâna (oblations)
with (the eighteen Mantras), 'Agni is the lord of beings; may he protect
me' (&c.).

11. <span id="fr_486"></span>[11](#fn_486) (The words), 'In this power
of holiness, in

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

this worldly power (&c.)' are added to (each section of) the Abhyâtâna
formulas.

12. <span id="fr_487"></span>[12](#fn_487) With (the last of the
Abhyâtâna formulas) 'Fathers! Grandfathers!' he sacrifices or performs
worship, wearing the sacrificial cord over his right shoulder.

13. <span id="fr_488"></span>[13](#fn_488) The Râsh*t*rabh*ri*t
(oblations he sacrifices) with (the twelve Mantras), 'The champion of
truth, he whose law is truth.' After having quickly repeated (each)
section, he sacrifices the first oblation with (the words), 'To him
svâhâ!' the second (oblation) with (the words), 'To them svâhâ!'

14. <span id="fr_489"></span>[14](#fn_489) Having placed a stone near
