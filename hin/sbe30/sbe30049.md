*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 2, SECTION 6.

1\. (This verse the teacher) murmurs in (the boy's) right ear;

2\. (The verse), 'Life-giving, Agni' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 3, 14, 4) in his
left ear.

3. <span id="fr_511"></span>[3](#fn_511) Both times he adds (to the
verses quoted in the last Sûtras the formula), 'Stand fast in Agni and
on the earth, in Vâyu and in the air, in Sûrya and in heaven. The bliss
in which Agni, Vâyu, the sun, the moon, and the waters go their way, in
that bliss go thy way, N.N.! Thou hast become the pupil of breath,
N.N.!'

4. <span id="fr_512"></span>[4](#fn_512) Approaching his mouth to (the
boy's) mouth he murmurs, 'Intelligence may Indra give thee, intelligence
the goddess Sarasvatî. Intelligence may the two A*s*vins, wreathed with
lotus, bestow on thee.'

5. <span id="fr_513"></span>[5](#fn_513) He then gives (the boy) in
charge (to the gods and demons, with the formulas), 'To Kashaka (?) I

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

give thee in charge. To Antaka I give thee in charge. To Aghora ("the
not frightful one") I give thee in charge. To Disease . . . to Yama . .
. to Makha . . . to Va*s*inî ("the ruling goddess") . . . to the earth
together with Vai*s*vânara . . . to the waters . . . to the herbs . . .
to the trees . . . to Heaven and Earth . . . to welfare . . . to holy
lustre . . . to the Vi*s*ve devâs . . . to all beings . . . to all
deities I give thee in charge.'

6. <span id="fr_514"></span>[6](#fn_514) He now teaches him the Sâvitrî,
if he has (already) been initiated before.

7\. If he has not been initiated (before, he teaches him the Sâvitrî)
after three days have elapsed.

8\. (He does so) immediately, says Pushkarasâdi.

9. <span id="fr_515"></span>[9](#fn_515) Having placed to the west of
the fire a bunch of grass with its points directed towards the north,
(the teacher) sits down thereon, facing the east, with (the formula), 'A
giver of royal power art thou, a teacher's seat. May I not withdraw from
thee.'

10\. The boy raises his joined hands towards the sun, embraces (the feet
of) his teacher, sits down to the south (of the teacher), addresses
(him), 'Recite, sir!' and then says, 'Recite the Sâvitrî, sir!'

11\. Having recited over (the boy the verse), 'We call thee, the lord of
the hosts' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. II, 3, 14, 3), he then recites (the Sâvitrî)
to him, firstly Pâda by Pâda, then hemistich by hemistich, and then the
whole verse (in the following way),

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

'Bhûs! Tat Savitur vare*n*ya*m* (That adorable splendour)—

'Bhuvo! Bhargo devasya dhîmahi (of the divine Savit*ri* may we obtain)—

'Suvar! Dhiyo yo na*h* pra*k*odayât (who should rouse our prayers).—

'Bhûr bhuvas! Tat Savitur vare*n*ya*m* bhargo devasya dhîmahi—

'Suvar! Dhiyo yo na*h* pra*k*odayât.—

'Bhûr bhuva*h* suvas! Tat Savitur . . . pra*k*odayât.'
