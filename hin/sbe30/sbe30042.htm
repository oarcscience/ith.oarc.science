<P><A NAME="fn_444"></A><A HREF="sbe30042.htm#fr_444">129:1</A> 10, 1 seq. The Arghya reception; Kh&acirc;dira-G<I>ri</I>hya IV, 4, 5 seq.; G<I>ri</I>hya-sa<I>m</I>graha II, 62-65. The first words of the Mantra quoted in S&ucirc;tra 1 are corrupt. The Mantra is evidently an adaptation of the well-known verse addressed to the &Acirc;grah&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc; (Gobhila III, 9, 9; Mantra-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a II, 2, 1), or to the Ash<I>t</I>ak&acirc; (P&acirc;raskara III, 3, 5, 8): pratham&acirc; ha vyuv&acirc;sa, &amp;c. The first word arha<I>n</I>&acirc; ('duly'), containing an allusion to the occasion of the Arghya ceremony, to which this Mantra is adapted, seems to be quite right; the third word may be, as Dr. Knauer conjectures, uv&acirc;sa ('she has dwelt,' or perhaps rather 'she has shone'). For the second word I am not able to suggest a correction.</P>
