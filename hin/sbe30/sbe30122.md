# ÂPASTAMBA'S YA*GÑ*A-PARIBHÂSHÂ-SÛTRAS. (*cont*.)

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_76">76</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXVI.

The Ash*t*â-kapâla for Agni, the Ekâda*s*a-kapâla or Dvâda*s*a-kapâla
for Indra-Agnî, form the principal acts at the Amâvâsyâ, the new moon,
in the case of one who does not sacrifice with Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_77">77</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXVII.

In the case of one who sacrifices with Soma, the second principal act is
the Sâ*m*nâyya (both at the full-moon and new-moon sacrifices).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_77_c">77<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Sâ*m*nâyya is a mixture of dadhi and payas, sour and sweet milk, and
is intended for Indra or Mahendra <span id="fr_798"></span>[1](#fn_798).
It takes the place of the second Puro*d*â*s*a at the new-moon sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_78">78</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXVIII.

In the case of a Brâhma*n*a, who does not sacrifice with Soma, the
Agnîshomîya cake is omitted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_78_c">78<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

This rule does not seem to be accepted by all schools. It is not found
in Kâtyâyana, and Hira*n*yake*s*in observes: Nâsomayâ*g*ino
brâhma*n*asyâgnîshomîya*h* puro*d*â*s*o vidyata ity ekeshâm. See
Hillebrandt, l.c. p. iii.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_79">79</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXIX.

Without distinction of caste, the Aindrâgna offering is omitted for one
who offers the Sâ*m*nâyya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_79_c">79<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Even though he be not a Somayâ*g*in, says the commentary.

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

This whole matter is summed up in Kapardin's commentary: Amâvâsyâyâm
asomayâ*g*ina aindrâgna-sâ*m*nâyyayor vikalpa*h*. Paur*n*amâsyâ*m* tv
asomayâ*g*ino brâhma*n*asyâgnîshomîyayâgâbhâva*h*. Tadrahitâpi
paur*n*amâsî purushârtha*m* sâdhayati. Tatra dvayor eva hi yâgayo*h*
paur*n*amâsî*s*abdavâ*k*yatvam asti, pratyeka*m* nâmayogât. Tasmâd
agnîshomîyayâgarahitâv evetarau purushârtha*m* sâdhayata*h*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80">80</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXX.

The Pit*ri*-ya*gñ*a, the sacrifice to the fathers, is not Aṅga
(auxiliary) because its own time is prescribed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_80_c">80<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The text should be pit*ri*ya*gñ*a*h* svakâlavidhânâd anaṅga*h* syât.
This sacrifice for the Manes, called also the Pi*nd*a-pit*ri*ya*gñ*a,
falls under the new-moon sacrifice, but is to be considered as a
pradhâna, a primary sacrifice, not as an aṅga, a member of the Dar*s*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_81">81</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXXI.

Also, because it is enumerated like the Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_81_c">81<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

This refers to such passages from the Brâhma*n*as as: There are four
great sacrifices, the Agnihotram, the Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsau, the
*K*âturmâsyâni, and the Pi*nd*a-pit*ri*ya*gñ*a*h*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_82">82</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXXII.

Also, because, when the Amâvâsyâ sacrifice is barred, the Pit*ri*ya*gñ*a
is seen to take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_83">83</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXXIII.

A principal act (pradhâna) is accompanied by auxiliary acts (aṅga).

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_83_c">83<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

This Sûtra forms sometimes part of the preceding Sûtra, and would then
refer to the Pit*ri*ya*gñ*a only.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_84">84</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXXIV.

A principal act is what has its own name, and is prescribed with special
reference to place, time, and performer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_84_c">84<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

This Sûtra is sometimes divided into two; the first, dese kâle kartarîti
nirdi*s*yate, the second, asva*s*abda*m* yat. The following are given as
illustrations. If it is said that 'he should sacrifice with the
Vai*s*vadeva on a slope inclined to the East,' we have the locality. If
it is said that 'he should sacrifice with the Vâ*g*apeya in autumn,' we
have the time. If it is said that 'the sacrificer himself should offer
the Agnihotra on a parvan (change of the moon),' we have the performer.
In each of these cases, therefore, the prescribed sacrificial act is a
pradhâna sâṅgam, a principal act with auxiliary members.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_85">85</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXXV.

The Darvi-homa (libation from a ladle) stands by itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_85_c">85<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Apûrva is explained by the commentator, not in its usual sense of
miraculous, but as not being subject to the former regulations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_86">86</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXXVI.

They are ordered by the word *g*uhoti, he pours out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87">87</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXXVII.

They are offered with the word Svâhâ.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_87_c">87<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

According to Kâtyâyana I, 2, 6-7, the *g*uhotis are

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

offered sitting, the ya*g*atis standing. See Sûtra XCII. The *g*uhoti
acts consist in pouring melted butter into the fire of the Âhavanîya
altar, which is so called because 'âhûyante<sup>ऽ</sup>sminn âhutaya*h*
kshipyanta iti.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_88">88</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXXVIII.

Taking (the butter) once.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_89">89</span></span>

### SÛTRA LXXXIX.

Or, if there are several Âhutis, taking (the butter) for each Âhuti.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90">90</span></span>

### SÛTRA XC.

Or, doing as he likes in dividing (the butter).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_90_c">90<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

These three Sûtras belong together. They teach that one slice (avadâna)
of butter should be taken, melted, and poured on the Âhavanîya fire; or,
if there are more than one âhuti, then one slice should be taken for
each. This, however, is made optional again by the last Sûtra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_91">91</span></span>

### SÛTRA XCI.

There is no fuel (in the Darvi-homa), except at the Agnihotra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_91_c">91<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

In the case of the Agnihotra it is distinctly stated, dve samidhâv
âdadhyât, let him lay down two sticks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_92">92</span></span>

### SÛTRA XCII.

One pours out (*g*uhoti) the Darvi-homas, sitting west of the Âhavanîya
fire, and bending the right knee, or not bending it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93">93</span></span>

### SÛTRA XCIII.

If it is distinctly stated, it is done in a different way.

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_93_c">93<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The vidhi, contained in Sûtra XCII, is therefore called autsargika,
general, and liable to exceptions, as when it is said, that he turns to
the east.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_94">94</span></span>

### SÛTRA XCIV.

One pours out (*g*uhoti) all âhutis, west of the Âhavanîya fire, passing
(the altar) southward, and then turning to the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95">95</span></span>

### SÛTRA XCV.

The Â*s*ruta and Pratyâ*s*ruta, the Yâ*g*yâ and Anuvâkyâ, the
Upastara*n*a and Abhighâra*n*a, with the slicings, the *K*aturg*ri*hîta
also, and the Vasha*t*kâra constitute the Darvi-homas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_95_c">95<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Â*s*ruta is â *s*râvaya; the Pratyâ*s*ruta, astu *s*rausha*t*;
Anuvâkyâ and Yâ*g*yâ are verses, the first inviting the deity, the
second accompanying the sacrifice. Whenever vegetable, animal, or
sâ*m*nâyya offerings have to be. sliced, upastara*n*a, spreading, and
abhighâra*n*a, sprinkling with fat, take place. With â*g*ya offerings
there is *K*aturg*ri*hîta (taking four times), and the Vasha*t*kâra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96">96</span></span>

### SÛTRA XCVI.

With âhutis one should let the act (the pouring out) take place after
the Vasha*t*kâra has been made, or while it is being made.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_96_c">96<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Vasha*t*kâra consists in the word Vasha*t*, to be uttered by the
Hot*ri*-priest. The five sacrificial interjections are, svâhâ,
srausha*t*, vausha*t*, vasha*t*, and svadhâ.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_97">97</span></span>

### SÛTRA XCVII.

With the Grahas the act should be made to coincide with the Upayâma.

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_97_c">97<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Grahas are offerings of Soma, and likewise the vessels (kamasa) in which
the Soma is offered. The Soma is offered with the words
upayâma-g*ri*hîto<sup>ऽ</sup>si, and while these words are being
uttered, the fluid should be poured out (dhârâ*m* srâvayet).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_98">98</span></span>

### SÛTRA XCVIII.

With the Ish*t*akâs, the act should be made to coincide with the words
tayâ deva tena.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_98_c">98<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

When the different ish*t*akâs or bricks are placed together for building
an altar, &c., the act itself begins with the first and ends with the
last words of the accompanying verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99">99</span></span>

### SÛTRA XCIX.

When there is a number of Puro*d*â*s*as, one should slice off one after
another, saying for each portion vyâvartadhvam (separate)!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_99_c">99<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Puro*d*â*s*a is a cake made of meal (pakva*h* pish*t*api*nd*a*h*),
different from karu, which is more of a pulse consisting of grains of
rice or barley, and clarified butter (gh*ri*tata*nd*ulobhayâtmakam).
This puro*d*â*s*a cake has to be divided for presentation to different
deities. If there are more than two deities, the plural vyâvartadhvam,
separate, has to be used.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100">100</span></span>

### SÛTRA C.

When the two last are sliced off, he should say for each portion,
vyâvartethâm, separate ye two!

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_100_c">100<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Each slice, avadâna, is said to be about a thumb's breadth. In the case
of sâ*m*nâyya, the mixture of sour and sweet milk, a kind of coagulated
sour milk, each portion is to be of the same breadth, but, as it is
fluid, it is

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

taken out with a ladle (sruva) of a corresponding size; see Kâtyâyana I,
9, 7.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_798"></span>[337:1](sbe30122.htm#fr_798) Vaidya in his
Dictionary explains it, however, as any substance mixed with clarified
butter and offered as a burnt offering, which can hardly be right.
