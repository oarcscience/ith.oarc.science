### PA*T*ALA 8, SECTION 29.

1. <span id="fr_643"></span>[1](#fn_643.md) 'House, do not fear, do not
tremble; bringing strength we come back. Bringing strength, gaining
wealth, wise I come back to the house, rejoicing in my mind.

'Of which the traveller thinks, in which much joy

dwells, the house I call. May it know us as we know it.

'Hither are called the cows; hither are called goats and sheep; and the
sweet essence of food is called hither to our house.

'Hither are called many friends, the sweet companionship of friends. May
our dwellings always be unharmed with all our men.

'Rich in sap, rich in milk, refreshing, full of joy and mirth, free from
hunger (?) and thirst, O house, do not fear us'—with (these verses) he
approaches his house (when returning from a journey).

2\. 'To thee I turn for the sake of safety, of peace. The blissful one!
The helpful one!, Welfare! Welfare!'—with (this formula) he enters.

3\. On that day, on which he has arrived, he should avoid all
quarrelling.

4\. 'The joyful house I enter which does not bring death to men; most
manly (I enter) the auspicious one. Bringing refreshment, with genial
minds (we enter the house); joyfully I lie down in it'—with (this verse)
he lies down.

5. <span id="fr_644"></span>[5](#fn_644.md) 'May we find our way with thee
through all hostile powers, as through streams of water'—with (this
verse) he looks at his wife; he looks at his wife.

End of the First Pra*s*na.
