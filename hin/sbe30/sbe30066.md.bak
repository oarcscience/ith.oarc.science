### PA*T*ALA 7, SECTION 23.

1\. (Then follow the Mantras), 'I know thee as the firm Brahman. May I
become firm in this world and in this country.

'I know thee as the immovable Brahman. May I not be moved away from this
world and from this country. May he who hates me, my rival, be moved
away from this world and from this country.

'I know thee as the unshaken Brahman. May I not be shaken off from this
world and from this country. May he who hates me, my rival, be shaken
off from this world and from this country.

'I know thee as the unfailing Brahman. May I not fall from this world
and from this country. May he who hates me, my rival, fall from this
world and from this country.

'I know thee as the nave of the universe. May I become the nave of this
country. I know thee as the centre of the universe. May I become the
centre of this country. I know thee as the string that holds the
universe. May I become the string that holds this country. I know thee
as the pillar

of the universe. May I become the pillar of this country. I know thee as
the navel of the universe. May I become the navel of this country.

'As the navel is the centre of the Prâ*n*as, thus I am the navel. May
hundred-and-onefold evil befall him who hates us and whom we hate; may
more than hundred-and-onefold merit fall to my lot!'

2\. Having spoken there with a person that he likes, and having returned
to the house, he causes her to sacrifice a mess of cooked food.

3\. The wife husks (the rice grains of which that Sthâlîpâka is
prepared).

4\. She cooks (that Sthâlîpâka), sprinkles (Â*g*ya) on it, takes it from
the fire, sacrifices to Agni, and then sacrifices to Agni
Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

5. <span id="fr_627"></span>[5](#fn_627) With (the remains of.md) that
(Sthâlîpâka) he entertains a learned Brâhma*n*a whom he reveres.

6\. To that (Brâhma*n*a) he makes a present of a bull.

7\. From that time he constantly sacrifices (ya*g*ate) on the days of
the full and of the new moon a mess of cooked food sacred to Agni.

8\. In the evening and in the morning he constantly sacrifices
(*g*uhoti) with his hand (and not with the Darvî) the two following
oblations of rice or of barley: 'To Agni Svâhâ! To Pra*g*âpati Svâhâ!'

9\. Some (teachers) state that in the morning the

former (of these oblations) should be directed to Sûrya.

10\. Through a period of three nights they should eat no saline food,
should sleep on the ground, wear ornaments, and should be chaste.

11. <span id="fr_628"></span>[11](#fn_628.md) In the fourth night, towards
morning, he puts wood on the fire, performs the (regular) ceremonies
down to the (regular) expiatory oblations, and sacrifices nine expiatory
oblations (with the following Mantras):

<span id="fn_627"></span>[196:5](sbe30066.htm#fr_627.md) 5, 6. In the
commentary these Sûtras are divided thus: 5. tena brâhma*n*a*m*
vidyâvanta*m* parivevesh*t*i; 6. yo<sup>ऽ</sup>syâpa*k*ito bhavati tasmâ
*ri*shabha*m* dadâti. (5. Therewith he entertains a learned Brâhma*n*a.
6. To one whom he reveres, he presents a bull.) The commentator observes
that some authorities make one Sûtra of the two, so that the Brâhma*n*a
who receives the food and the one to whom the bull is given, would be
the same person.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[197:11](sbe30066.htm#fr_628.md) According to the
commentary he performs the regular ceremonies down to the oblation
offered with the Mantra, 'Thus thou, Agni' (see above, I, 3, 5, and
compare Pâraskara I, 2, 8). Mât*ri*datta says, prâya*sk*ittiparyanta*m*
k*ri*tvâ sa tva*m* no Agna ity etadanta*m* k*ri*tvâ nava prâya*sk*ittîr
*g*uhoti . . . vyâh*ri*tiparyanta*m* k*ri*tvâ ima*m* me Varu*n*eti
