### PRAPÂ*TH*AKA IV, KÂ*ND*IKÂ 1.

1. <span id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_350) He throws the two spits into
the fire;

2\. That which consists of one (simple) branch, towards the east, the
other one towards the west.

3. <span id="fr_351"></span>[3](#fn_351) They cut off the Avadâna
portions from all its limbs,

4\. With the exception of the left thigh and the lungs.

5\. The left thigh he should keep for the Anvash*t*akya ceremony.

6. <span id="fr_352"></span>[6](#fn_352) On the same fire he cooks one
mess of rice-grains and one of meat, stirring up the one and the other
separately, from left to right, with two pot-ladles.

7\. After he has cooked them, he should pour (Â*g*ya) on them, should
take them from the fire towards the north, and should pour (Â*g*ya) on
them again.

8\. Having poured the juice (of the Avadânas) into a brazen vessel,

9\. And having placed the Avadânas on a layer (of grass) on which
branches of the Plaksha (tree) have been spread,

10. <span id="fr_353"></span>[10](#fn_353) He cuts off (the prescribed
portions) from the

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Avadânas in the
way prescribed for Sthâlîpâkas, (and puts those portions) into (another)
brazen vessel;

11\. And (the portion) for the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation separately.

12\. Taking of the mess of boiled rice-grains (Sûtra 6) a portion of the
size of a Bilva fruit, he should mix that, together with the Avadânas
(Sûtra 10), with the juice (Sûtra 8).

13\. Taking a fourfold portion of Â*g*ya he should sacrifice it with the
first of the eight *Rik*as, 'Entering into fire, the fire' (MB. II, 2,
9-16).

14\. Of the mixture (Sûtra 12) he cuts off the third part and sacrifices
it with the second and third (verse).

15\. He places the word Svâhâ after the second (of those verses, i.e.
after the third verse of the whole Mantra).

16\. In the same way he sacrifices the other two-thirds (of that
mixture, the one) with the fourth and fifth (verse), and (the other)
with the sixth and seventh (verse).

17\. Having cut off the rest, he should sacrifice the oblation to (Agni)
Svish*t*ak*ri*t with the eighth (verse).

18\. Even if he be very deficient in wealth, he should celebrate (the
Ash*t*akâ) with (the sacrifice of) an animal.

19\. Or he should sacrifice a Sthâlîpâka.

20. <span id="fr_354"></span>[20](#fn_354) Or he should offer food to a
cow.

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

21. <span id="fr_355"></span>[21](#fn_355) Or he should burn down
brushwood in the forest and should say, 'This is my Ash*t*akâ.'

22\. But let him not neglect to do (one of these things). But let him
not neglect to do (one of these things).
