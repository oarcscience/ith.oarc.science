### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 8, SECTION 27.

1\. If he will have a house built, he should during the northerly course
of the sun, in the time of the increasing moon, under the constellation
Rohi*n*î and under the three constellations designated as Uttara
(Uttara-Phalgunî, Uttara-Ashâ*dh*â, Uttara-Prosh*th*apadâ*h*) put wood
on the fire, perform the rites down to the Vyâh*ri*ti oblations, and
should sacrifice with (the verses), 'This, O Varu*n*a' (&c.; see I, 2,
8, 16, down to the end of the Sûtra). Then he serves food to the
Brâhma*n*as and causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good
luck!' he puts on a garment that has not yet been washed, touches water,
takes a shovel with (the formula), 'On the impulse of the god Savit*ri*'
(Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 3, 1, 1) draws lines thrice from the left to the
right round (the places where the pits for the posts shall be dug) with
(the formula), 'A line has been drawn' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 3, 1, 1), digs
the pits (in which the posts shall be erected) as it is fit, and casts
the earth (dug out of those pits) towards the inside (of the
building-ground).

2\. He erects the southern door-post with (the verse), 'Here I erect a
firm house; it stands in peace, streaming ghee. Thus may we walk in
thee, O house, blessed with heroes, with all heroes, with unharmed
heroes;'

3\. The northern (door-post) with (the verse), 'Stand here firmly, O
house, rich in horses and cows, rich in delight; rich in sap,
overflowing with milk be set up, for the sake of great happiness.'

4. <span id="fr_640"></span>[4](sbe30071.htm#fn_640) With (the verse.md),
'To thee (may) the young child (go), to thee the calf with its
companion, to thee the golden cup; to thee may they go with pots of
curds'—he touches the two posts, after they have been erected.

5\. In the same way (Sûtras 2. 3) he erects the two chief posts,

6\. And touches them as above (Sûtra 4).

7\. He fixes the beam of the roof on the posts with (the formula),
'Rightly ascend the post, O beam, erect, shining, drive off the enemies.
Give us treasures and valiant sons.'

8. <span id="fr_641"></span>[8](sbe30071.htm#fn_641.md) When the house has
got its roof, he touches it with (the verse),

'The consort of honour, a blissful refuge, a goddess, thou hast been
erected by the gods in the beginning; clothed in grass, cheerful thou
art; bring us bliss, to men and animals.'

9\. Then, under the constellation Anurâdhâ, the ground (on which the
house stands) is expiated (in the following way).

10\. By night he puts wood on the fire in an inner room (of the house),
performs the rites down to the Vyâh*ri*ti oblations, and sacrifices
(with the following Mantras):
