# ÂPASTAMBA'S YA*GÑ*A-PARIBHÂSHÂ-SÛTRAS. (*cont*.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_126">126</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXVI.

They are optionally vikâras of the Aindrâgna.

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_126_c">126<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Sometimes these two Sûtras are combined into one. The commentator,
however, sees in the vâ of aindrâgnavikârâ vâ a deeper meaning.
Agnî-Shomau, he says, consists of four, Indrâgnî of three syllables.
Therefore if the name of more than one deity consists of four syllables,
it should be treated as a vikâra of the Agnîshomîya, if of less than
four syllables, as a vikâra of the Aindrâgna.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_127">127</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXVII.

An exception must be made in the case of the gods of the prak*ri*ti, as,
for instance, the Aindra puro*d*â*s*a, the Saumya *k*aru.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_127_c">127<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The exception applies to cases where the offering in a vik*ri*ti
sacrifice is meant for the same principal deities as those of the
prak*ri*ti offering. For instance, in the Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsa Agni and
Soma are the deities of the Agnîshomîya, Indra and Agni of the
Aindrâgna. If then in one of the secondary or vik*ri*ti sacrifices there
occurs an Aindra puro*d*â*s*a, or a Saumya *k*aru, then the Aindra
puro*d*â*s*a is treated as a vikâra of the Aindrâgna, the Saumya karu as
a vikâra of the Agnîshomîya. The Somendra *k*aru also, as its principal
deity is Soma, would follow the Agnîshomîya, the Indrâsomîya
puro*d*â*s*a, as its principal deity is Indra, would follow the
Aindrâgna.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_128">128</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXVIII.

If there is sameness both in the offering and in the deity, then the
offering prevails.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_128_c">128<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

If a *k*aru for Pra*g*âpati occurs in a vik*ri*ti sacrifice, it would
follow that, being offered to Pra*g*âpati, it should be offered with
murmuring, but, as it is a vegetable offering, it follows the norm of
the puro*d*â*s*a, though the puro*d*â*s*a is intended for Agni.

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129">129</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXIX.

If there is contradiction with regard to the substance and the
preparation of an offering, the substance prevails.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_129_c">129<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

A puro*d*â*s*a may be made of vrîhi, rice, or of nîvâra, wild growing
rice. The wild rice has to be pounded, but not the good rice. The
preparation, however, has to yield in a vik*ri*ti, the important point
being the substance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130">130</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXX.

If there is contradiction with regard to the substance, the object
prevails.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_130_c">130<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

An example makes the meaning of this Sûtra quite clear. Generally the
yûpa or sacrificial post for fastening sacrificial animals is made of
Khadira wood. But if a post made of wood is not strong enough to hold
the animal, then an iron post is to be used, the object being the
fastening of the animal, while the material is of less consequence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131">131</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXXI.

In a Prak*ri*ti sacrifice there is no Ûha, modification of the mantras.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_131_c">131<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Certain mantras of the Veda have to be slightly altered, when their
application varies. In the normal sacrifices, however, no such
alteration takes place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_132">132</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXXII.

In a Vik*ri*ti sacrifice modification takes place, according to the
sense, but not in an arthavâda.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_132_c">132<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Some mantras remain the same in the Vik*ri*ti as in the Prak*ri*ti.
Others have to be modified so as to be

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

adapted to anything new that has to be. If, for instance, there is a
Puro*d*â*s*a for Agni in the Prak*ri*ti, and in its place a Puro*d*â*s*a
for Sûrya in the Vik*ri*ti, then we must place Sûrya instead of Agni in
the dedicatory mantra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_133">133</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXXIII.

When we hear words referring to something else, that is arthavâda.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_133_c">133<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Arthavâda is generally explained as anything occurring in the
Brâhma*n*as which is not vidhi or command. Here, however, it refers to
Mantras or passages recited at the sacrifice. We saw how such passages,
if they referred to some part of the sacrifice, had to be modified under
certain circumstances according to the sense. Here we are told that
passages which do not refer to anything special in the sacrifice, are
arthavâda and remain unmodified. All this is expressed by the words
paravâkya*s*rava*n*ât. Vâkya stands for padâni, words, such as are used
in the nivâpamantra, &c. Some of these words are called samavetârthâni,
because they tell of something connected with the performance of the
sacrifice, as, for instance, Agnaye *g*ush*t*a*m* nirvapâmi, I offer
what is acceptable to Agni; others are asamavetârthâni, as, for
instance, Devasya tvâ Savitu*h* prasave. When such passages which are
not connected with some sacrificial act occur (*s*rava*n*ât), they
naturally remain unaltered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_134">134</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXXIV.

If what is prescribed is absent, a substitute is to be taken according
to similarity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_134_c">134<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Here we have no longer modification, but substitution (pratinidhi). In
cases where anything special that has been prescribed is wanting, a
substitute must be chosen, as similar as possible, and producing a
similar effect.

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> According to
Ma*nd*ana's Trikâ*nd*a, the degrees of similarity are to be determined
in the following order:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Kâryai rûpais tathâ par*n*ai*h* kshîrai*h* pushpai*h* phalair api,  
Gandhai rasai*h* sad*ri*g grâhyam pûrvâlâbhe param param.

</div>

'What is similar by effect, by shape, by leaves, by milk, by flowers,
and by fruit, By smell, or by taste is to be taken one after the other,
if the former cannot be found.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_135">135</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXXV.

If there is nothing very like, something a little like may be
substituted, only it must not be prohibited.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_135_c">135<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

If in a *k*aru of mudgas, kidney-beans, phaseolus mungo, these
kidney-beans should fail, a substitute may be taken, but that substitute
must not be mâshas, phaseolus radiatus, because these mâshas are
expressly forbidden; for it is said, Aya*gñ*iyâ vai mâshâ*h*, 'Mâshas
are not fit for sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136">136</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXXVI.

The substitute should take the nature of that for which it is
substituted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_136_c">136<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Taddharma, having the same qualities. If, for instance, nîvâra has been
substituted for vrîhi, it should be treated as if it were vrîhi. The
name vrîhi should remain, and should not be replaced by nîvâra, just as
Soma, if replaced by pûtikâ, is still called Soma. Thus, when in the
course of a sacrifice vrîhi has once been replaced by nîvâra, and vrîhi
can be procured afterwards, yet nîvâra is then to be retained to the
end. If, however, the substituted nîvâra also come to an end, and
afterwards both nîvâra and vrîhi are forthcoming, then vrîhi has the
preference. If neither be forthcoming, then some substitute is to be
taken that approaches nearest to the substitute, the nîvâra, not to the

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

original vrîhi. Further, if a choice has been allowed between vrîhi,
rice, and yava, barley, and vrîhi has been chosen, and afterwards, as
substitute for vrîhi, nîvâra, then, if nîvâra come to an end, and in the
absence of vrîhi, when a new supply of both nîvâra, and yava has been
obtained, the yava is to be avoided, and the original substitute for
vrîhi, the nîvâra, must be retained. In most of these cases, however, a
certain penance also (prâya*sk*itta) is required.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137">137</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXXVII.

If something is wanting in the measure, let him finish with the rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_137_c">137<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

If it is said that a puro*d*â*s*a should be as large as a horse's hoof,
and there is not quite so much left, yet whatever is left should be used
to finish the offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138">138</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXXVIII.

Substitution does not apply to the master, the altar-fire, the deity,
the word, the act, and a prohibition.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_138_c">138<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The master is meant for the sacrificer himself and his wife. Their place
cannot, of course, be taken by anybody else. The altar-fire is supposed
to have a supernatural power, and cannot be replaced by any other fire.
Nothing can take the place of the invoked deities, nor of the words used
in the mantras addressed to them, nor can the sacrifice itself be
replaced by any other act. Lastly, when it is said that mâshas, varakas,
kodravas are not fit for sacrifice, or that a man ought not to sacrifice
with what should not be eaten by Âryas, nothing else can be substituted
for what is thus prohibited.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_139">139</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXXXIX.

The Prak*ri*ti stops from three causes, from a corollary, from a
prohibition, and from loss of purpose.

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_139_c">139<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

A corollary (pratyâmnâna) occurs, when it is said, 'instead of Ku*s*a
grass, let him make a barhis of reeds.' A prohibition (pratishedha)
occurs, when it is said, 'he does not choose an Ârsheya.' Loss of
purpose (arthalopa) occurs, when pesha*n*a, pounding, would refer to
*k*aru, a pulse, that cannot be pounded, while grains can be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140">140</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXL.

The Agnish*t*oma is the Prak*ri*ti of the Ekâha sacrifices.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_140_c">140<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Ekâha are sacrifices accomplished in one day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_141">141</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXLI.

The Dvâda*s*âha is the Prak*ri*ti of the Aharga*n*as.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_141_c">141<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Dvâda*s*âha lasts twelve days and is a Soma sacrifice. It is either
an Ahîna or a Sattra. An Aharga*n*a is a series of daily and nightly
sacrifices. Those which last from two nights to eleven nights are called
Ahîna. Those which last from thirteen to one hundred nights or more are
called Sattras.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_142">142</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXLII.

The Gavâmayana is the Prak*ri*ti of the Sâ*m*vatsarikas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_142_c">142<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The Gavâmayana lasts three years, and it is the type of all
Sâ*m*vatsarika sacrifices, whether they last one, two, three or more
years. They all belong to the class of Sattras.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_143">143</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXLIII.

Of the Nikâyi sacrifices the first serves as Prak*ri*ti.

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_143_c">143<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Among the Nikâyi sacrifices, lit. those which consist of a number, all
having the same name, but different rewards, the first is the prak*ri*ti
of the subsequent ones. The commentator calls them sâdyaskra &c., and
mentions as the first the Agnish*t*oma. See Sûtra CXLVI, and Weber, Ind.
Stud. XIII, p. 218.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_144">144</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXLIV.

At the Agnish*t*oma there is the Uttara-vedi.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_144_c">144<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The commentator explains this by saying that at the Soma sacrifices,
i.e. at the Agnish*t*oma, Ukthya, Sho*d*a*s*in, and Atirâtra, the fire
is carried from the Âhavanîya to the Uttara-vedi, which is also called
the Soma altar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_145">145</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXLV.

The fire is valid for the successive sacrifices.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_145_c">145<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

This fire refers to the fire on the Uttara-vedi, mentioned in the
preceding Sûtra, and the object of the Sûtra seems to be to include the
act of lighting the fire on the Uttara-vedi in the Prak*ri*ti, though
properly speaking it does not form part of the Agnish*t*oma. But I
cannot quite understand the argument of the commentator.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_146">146</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXLVI.

This does not apply to the Sâdyaskras, the Vâ*g*apeya, the Sho*d*a*s*in,
and the Sârasvata Sattra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_146_c">146<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

With regard to the Sho*d*a*s*in and its vikâra, the Vâ*g*apeya, the
laying of the fire is not mentioned. In the case of the Sâdyaskras, it
becomes impossible, because they have to be quickly finished. In the
case of the Sârasvata Sattra, there is the same difficulty on account of
not remaining in the same place (anavasthâpân nâgni*s* *k*îyate).

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_147">147</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXLVII.

A sacrificer wishes the object of his sacrifice at the beginning of the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_147_c">147<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Some MSS. read kâmayeta, 'he should wish,' but the commentator explains
that such a command (vidhi) is unnecessary, because it is natural to
form a wish (svata*h* siddhatvât).

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_148">148</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXLVIII.

At the beginning of a special part of the sacrifice, one should wish the
object of that part of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_148_c">148<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

The commentary, though objecting, and objecting rightly, to kâmayeta,
'he should wish,' in the preceding Sûtra, accepts kâmayeta as
determining the present Sûtra, saying kâmayetety anuvartate. One should
read ya*gñ*âṅgakâmam, not ya*gñ*akâmam, for the commentary explains it
by ya*gñ*âṅgaphalasaṅkalpa*h*. Whether it was really intended that there
should be a special wish for each part or subsidiary act of a sacrifice
(ya*gñ*âṅga), is another question, but the commentator evidently thought
so.

Kâtyâyana, who treats the same subject (1, 2, 10 seq.), states that
there should be this desire for a reward for certain sacrifices which
are offered for a certain purpose, as, for instance, the Dvâda*s*âha,
but that there are no such motives for other sacrifices, and parts of
sacrifices. He mentions, first of all, a niyama, a precept for the
sacrifice, such as 'Speak the truth.' Then a nimitta, a special cause,
as when some accident has taken place that must be remedied, for
instance, when the house has been burnt down, &c. Thirdly, the
Agnihotra, the morning and evening Homa; fourthly, the
Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsau; fifthly, the Dâkshâya*n*a, a vik*ri*ti of the
Dar*s*a-pûr*n*amâsau, the Âgraya*n*a; sixthly, the Nirû*dh*a-pa*s*u, the
animal sacrifice. All these have to be performed as a sacred

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

duty, and without any view to special rewards. Thus we read in
Vâsish*th*a:

Ava*s*yam brâhma*n*o<sup>ऽ</sup>gnîn âdadhîta,
dar*s*apûr*n*amâsâgraya*n*esh*t*i*k*âturmâsyapa*s*usomai*s* *k*a
ya*g*eta, 'A Brâhma*n*a should without fail place his fires, and offer
the Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa, the Âgraya*n*esh*t*i, the Kâturmâsyas, the P a
*s* u, and the Soma sacrifices.'

Hârîta says: Pâkaya*gñ*ân ya*g*en nitya*m* havirya*gñ*â*ms* *k*a
nitya*s*a*h*, Somâ*ms* *k*a vidhipûrve*n*a ya i*kkh*ed dharmam avyayam,
'Let a man offer the Pâkaya*gñ*as always, always also the Havirya*gñ*as,
and the Soma sacrifices, according to rule, if he wishes for eternal
merit.' The object of these sacrifices is
aparimitani*hs*reyasarûpamoksha, eternal happiness, and hence they have
to be performed during life at certain seasons, without any special
occasion (nimitta), and without any special object (kâma). According to
most authorities, however, they have to be performed during thirty years
only. After that the Agnihotra only has to be kept up. The proper
seasons for these sacrifices are given by Manu, IV, 25-27:

A Brâhma*n*a shall always offer the Agnihotra at the beginning or at the
end of the day and of the night, and the Dar*s*a and Paur*n*amâsa
(ish*t*is) at the end of each half-month;

'When the old grain has been consumed the (Âgraya*n*a) Ish*t*i with new
grain; at the end of the (three) seasons the (*K*âturmâsya) sacrifices;
at the solstices an animal (sacrifice); at the end of the year Soma
offerings;

'A Brâhma*n*a, who keeps sacred fires, shall, if he desires to live
long, not eat new grain or meat, without having offered the (Âgraya*n*a)
Ish*t*i with new grain and an animal (sacrifice) <span
id="fr_799"></span>[1](#fn_799).'

These Pâkaya*gñ*as, Havirya*gñ*as or ish*t*is, and Soma sacrifices are
enumerated by Gautama <span id="fr_800"></span>[2](#fn_800), as follows:

According to the substances offered, sacrifices are sometimes

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

divided into vegetable and animal sacrifices. The vegetable substances
are, ta*nd*ulâ*h*, pish*t*âni, phalîkara*n*â*h*, puro*d*â*s*a*h*,
odana*h*, yavâgû*h*, p*ri*thukâ*h*, lâ*g*â*h*, dhânâ*h*, and aktava*h*.
The animal substances are, paya*h*, dadhi, â*g*yam, âmikshâ, vâ*g*inam,
vapâ, tva*k*a*h*, mâ*m*sam, lohitam, and pa*s*urasa*h*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_149">149</span></span>

### SÛTRA CXLIX.

If there are fewer Mantras and more (sacrificial) acts, then after
dividing them into equal parts, let him perform the former with the
former, the latter with the latter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_149_c">149<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

It happens, for instance, in certain ish*t*is that a pair of Yâ*g*yâ and
Anuvâkyâ mantras is given, but six acts. In that case one half of the
mantras is used for one half of the acts, and the other half of the
mantras for the other half of the acts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150">150</span></span>

### SÛTRA CL.

If there are fewer acts and more Mantras, let him perform and act with
one mantra, those which remain are optional, as the materials for the
sacrificial post.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_150_c">150<sup>c</sup></span></span>

**Commentary.**

Kapardisvâmin seems to have divided this Sûtra into three, the second
being ava*s*ish*t*â vikalpârthâ*h*, the third yathâ yûpadravyâ*n*îti.
But it is better to take it as one, as it is in MS. 1676.

If there are, for instance, fourteen vapanas, while there are many more
mantras, let him select fourteen mantras and use them for each vapana,
while the rest will be useful for another performance. A similar case
occurs when different kinds of wood are recommended for making the
sacrificial post, or when rice or barley are recommended for an
offering. Here a choice has to be made. The iti at the end is explained
as showing that there are other instances of the same kind.
