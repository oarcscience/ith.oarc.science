butter (on that surface) with his mouth, repeating that Mantra in his
mind.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

oblation (with the verse, 'A full oblation I sacrifice,' MB. II, 6, 11)
should be performed on the sacrificial day (i.e. on the first day of the
fortnight),

24\. And (on such a day let him sacrifice) with (the formula),
