*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 1, SECTION 3.

1. <span id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_726) Under the Maghâs (Nakshatra.md)
cows are provided;

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

2\. Under the Phalgunî (Nakshatra) marriage is celebrated.

3. <span id="fr_727"></span>[3](#fn_727.md) A daughter whom he wishes to be
dear (to her husband), a father should give in marriage under the
Nish*t*yâ (Nakshatra); thus she becomes dear (to her husband); she does
not return (to her father's) house: this is an observance based on a
Brâhma*n*a.

4. <span id="fr_728"></span>[4](#fn_728.md) The word Invakâs means
M*ri*ga*s*iras; the word Nish*t*yâ means Svâti.

5. <span id="fr_729"></span>[5](#fn_729.md) At the wedding one cow;

6\. In the house one cow:

7\. With the (first cow) he should prepare an Argha reception for the
bridegroom as for a guest,

8\. With the other (the bridegroom \[?\] should do so) for a person whom
he reveres.

9\. These are the occasions for killing a cow: (the arrival of) a guest,
(the Ash*t*akâ sacrifice offered to) the Fathers, and marriage.

10. <span id="fr_730"></span>[10](#fn_730) Let (the wooer.md) avoid in his
wooing a girl that sleeps, or cries, or has left home.

11. <span id="fr_731"></span>[11](#fn_731.md) And let him avoid one who has
been given (to another), and who is guarded (by her relations), and one
who looks wicked (?), or who is a most

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

excellent one (?), or (who is like the fabulous deer) *s*arabha (?), a
hunch-back, a girl of monstrous appearance, a bald-headed girl, a girl
whose skin is like a frog's (?), a girl who has gone over to another
family (?), a girl given to sensual pleasures (?), or a herdess, or one
who has too many friends, or who has a fine younger sister, or one whose
age is too near to that of the bridegroom (?).

12. <span id="fr_732"></span>[12](#fn_732.md) Girls who have the name of a
Nakshatra, or of a river, or of a tree, are objectionable.

13\. And all girls in whose names the last letter but one is r or l, one
should avoid in wooing.

14\. If possible, he should place (the following) objects hidden before
the girl, and should say to her, 'Touch (one of these things).'

15\. (The objects are), different kinds of seeds mixed together, loose
earth from (the kind of sacrificial altar called) vedi, an earth-clod
from a field, cow-dung, and an earth-clod from a cemetery.

16. <span id="fr_733"></span>[16](#fn_733.md) If she touches one of the
former (objects, this portends) prosperity as characterized (by the
nature of what she has touched).

17\. The last is regarded as objectionable.

18\. Let him marry a girl of good family and character, with auspicious
characteristics, and of good health.

19\. Good family, a good character, auspicious characteristics,
learning, and good health: these are the accomplishments of a
bridegroom.

20\. A wife who is pleasing to his mind and his

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

eyes, will bring happiness to him; let him pay no attention to the other
things: such is the opinion of some.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_726"></span>[255:1](sbe30096.htm#fr_726.md) 3, 1, 2. Comp.
*Ri*g-veda X, 85, 13; Atharva-veda XIV, i, 13; Kau*s*ika-sûtra 75;
Râmâya*n*a I, 71, 24; 72, 13; Weber, Die vedischen Nachrichten von den
Naxatra, II, 364 seq. These parallel passages most decidedly show that
in Sûtra 2 we ought to read vyuhyate, not vyûhyate.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[256:3](sbe30096.htm#fr_727.md) Comp. Taittirîya
Brâhma*n*a I, 5, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[256:4](sbe30096.htm#fr_728.md) Comp. Sûtra 3, and
above, Section 2, Sûtra 16.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[256:5](sbe30096.htm#fr_729.md) 5-8. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya I, 12, 10. It is clear that with the first cow the
bride's father has to receive the bridegroom. The 'house' mentioned in
Sûtra 6 seems to be the house of the newly-married couple. In the
expression 'whom he reveres,' 'he,' according to the commentaries, is
the bridegroom.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[256:10](sbe30096.htm#fr_730.md) This Sûtra forms
a half-*s*loka.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[256:11](sbe30096.htm#fr_731.md) Most expressions
in this Sûtra are quite doubtful, and their translation rests on the
explanations of the commentators (see pp. 44, 45 of Dr. Winternitz's
edition), which are evidently for the most part only guesses.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[257:12](sbe30096.htm#fr_732.md) 12, 13. These
Sûtras would require only slight alterations to make a *s*loka.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[257:16](sbe30096.htm#fr_733.md) The seeds mean
offspring, and so on.
