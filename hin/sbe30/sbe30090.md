### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 8, SECTION 18.

1\. Now we shall explain the opening and the conclusion (of the annual
course of study).

full moon, when the herbs have appeared, under (the Nakshatra) Hasta or
on the full-moon day (itself), the opening ceremony of the (annual
course of) study (is performed).

3\. Having put wood on the fire and performed the rites down to the
Vyâh*ri*ti oblations, he sacrifices (with his pupils) to the *Ri*shis of
the Kâ*nd*as: 'To Pra*g*âpati, the *Ri*shi of a Kâ*nd*a, svâhâ! To Soma,
the *Ri*shi of a Kâ*nd*a, svâhâ! To Agni, the *Ri*shi of a Kâ*nd*a,
svâhâ! To the Vi*s*ve devâs, the *Ri*shis of a Kâ*nd*a, svâhâ! To
Svayambhû, the *Ri*shi of a Kâ*nd*a, svâhâ!'—these are the *Ri*shis of
the Kâ*nd*as. Or (he sacrifices) to the names of the Kâ*nd*as, to the
Sâvitrî, to the *Ri*g-veda, the Ya*g*ur-veda, the Sâma-veda, the
Atharva-veda, and to Sadasaspati.

4\. Having (thus) sacrificed, they repeat the first three Anuvâkas,

5\. Or the beginnings of all Kâ*nd*as.

6\. He enters upon (sacrificing) the *G*aya, &c. (oblations; see above,
I, 1, 3, 8).

7\. After all rites down to the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation have been
performed, they stop studying three days or one day; then they should go
on studying so as to commence where they have broken off: so say the
teachers.

8. <span id="fr_704"></span>[8](#fn_704) During the fortnight that
precedes the Taishî full moon, under (the Nakshatra) Rohi*n*î or on the
full-moon day (itself), the Utsarga (or conclusion of the term of study)
is celebrated.

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

9. <span id="fr_705"></span>[9](#fn_705) (The teacher) with his pupils
goes in an easterly or northerly direction, and where they find a
pleasant water with a pleasant bathing-place, they dive into it and
perform three suppressions of the breath with the Agharmarsha*n*a hymn
(*Ri*g-veda X, 190 = Taitt. Ar. X, 1, 13. 14.). Holding purifiers (i.e.
Darbha blades) in their hands they bathe with the three (verses), 'Ye
waters, ye are wholesome' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 1, 5, 1), with the four
(verses), 'The gold-coloured, pure, purifying waters' (T.S.V, 6, 1, 1
seq.), and with the Anuvâka, '(Soma) which clears itself, the heavenly
being' (Taitt. Br. I, 4, 8): giving the Darbha blades to each other and
feigning to try to seize (??) each other.

10\. Then they arrange on a pure spot that is inclined towards the east,
seats of eastward-pointed Darbha grass, so that they end in the north—
