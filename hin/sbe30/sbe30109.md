Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 6, SECTION 16.

1\. In the sixth month after the child's birth he serves food to
Brâhma*n*as and causes them to pronounce auspicious wishes; then he
should pour together curds, honey, ghee, and boiled rice, and should
give (the mixture) to the boy to eat, with the next (four) Mantras (II,
14, 7-10);

2\. (He should feed him) with partridge, according to some (teachers).

3\. In the third year after his birth the *K*aula (or tonsure is
performed) under (the Nakshatra of) the two Punarvasus.

4. <span id="fr_771"></span>[4](#fn_771.md) Brâhma*n*as are entertained
with food as at the initiation (Upanayana).

5. <span id="fr_772"></span>[5](#fn_772) The putting (of wood.md) on the
fire, &c. (is performed) as at the Sîmantonnayana.

6. <span id="fr_773"></span>[6](#fn_773) He makes (the boy.md) sit down to
the west of

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

the fire, facing the east, combs his hair silently with a porcupine's
quill that has three white spots, with three Darbha blades, and with a
bunch of unripe Udumbara fruits; and he arranges the locks in the
fashion of his ancestral *Ri*shis,

7\. Or according to their family custom.

8. <span id="fr_774"></span>[8](#fn_774.md) The ceremonies beginning with
the pouring together of (warm and cold) water and ending with the
putting down of the hair are the same (as above; comp. M. II, 14, 11).

9\. He puts down the razor after having washed it off.

10. <span id="fr_775"></span>[10](#fn_775) The ceremony is (repeated.md)
three days with the (same razor). (Then) the rite is finished.

11\. (The father) gives an optional gift (to the Brâhma*n*a who has
assisted).

12\. The Godâna (or the ceremony of shaving the beard, is performed) in
the sixteenth year, in exactly the same way or optionally under another
constellation.

13. <span id="fr_776"></span>[13](#fn_776.md) Or he may perform the Godâna
sacred to Agni.

14. <span id="fr_777"></span>[14](#fn_777.md) Some prescribe the keeping of
a vow through one year in connection with the Godâna.

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

15\. The difference (between the Kaula and the Godâna) is that (at the
Godâna) the whole hair is shaven (without leaving the locks).

16. <span id="fr_778"></span>[16](#fn_778.md) According to the followers of
the Sâma-veda he should 'touch water.'
