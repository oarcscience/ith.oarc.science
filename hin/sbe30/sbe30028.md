### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 6.

1. <span id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_314.md) When his cows are driven out,
he should repeat (the verse), 'May (Bhava), the all-valiant one, (and
Indra protect) these (cows) for me' (MB. I, 8, 1).

2\. When they have come back, (he should repeat the verse), 'These which
are rich in sweet' (ibid. 2).

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

3\. If he is desirous of thriving (in his cattle), he should lick with
his tongue the forehead of the firstborn calf, before it is licked by
its mother, and should gulp with (the formula), 'Thou art the phlegm of
the cows' (ibid. 3).

4\. If he is desirous of thriving (in his cattle), he should, when the
cows have calved, at night put wood on the fire in the cow-stable and
should sacrifice churned curds with drops of ghee, with (the verse),
'Seizer, seize' (ibid. 4).

5\. If he is desirous of thriving (in his cattle), he makes, when the
cows have calved, with a sword of Udumbara wood, marks on a male and on
a female calf, first on the male, then on the female, with (the Mantra),
'The world art thou, thousandfold' (ibid. 5. 6),

6\. And after he has done so, he should recite (over the two calves the
Mantra), 'With metal, with the butcher's knife' (ibid. 7).

7\. When the rope (to which the calves are bound) is spread out, and
(again) when the calves have been bound to it, he should recite over it
(the verse), 'This rope, the mother of the cows' (ibid. 8).

8\. Here now the following (rites) have to be performed day by day,
(viz.)

9. <span id="fr_315"></span>[9](#fn_315) (The rites at.md) the driving out
(of the cows), at the coming back (of the cows), and at the setting into
motion of the rope (with the calves).

10\. At the cow-sacrifice (i.e. the sacrifice by which a thriving
condition for the cows is obtained), boiled rice-grains with milk (are

11\. Let him sacrifice to Agni, Pûshan, Indra, and Î*s*vara.

12\. To the bull honour is done (by adorning it, by lavish food, &c.).

13\. By the cow-sacrifice also the horse-sacrifice (i.e. the sacrifice
by which thriving horses are obtained) has been explained.

14\. Of deities Yama and Varu*n*a are added here (to the deities stated
above) (Sûtra II).
