### PA*T*ALA 5, SECTION 15.

1\. On the following day he sacrifices a cow to the Fathers.

2. <span id="fr_689"></span>[2](#fn_689.md) Having put wood on the fire and
strewn southward-pointed and eastward-pointed Darbha grass around it, he
sacrifices the oblation for the touching of the animal (see below), with
(the verse), 'This cow I touch for the Fathers; may my assembled fathers
gladly accept it (which is offered) with fat and ghee, with the word
svadhâ; may it satiate my fathers in the other world. Svadhâ!
Adoration!' Then he touches (the cow) with one (blade of) sacrificial
grass and with an unforked Vapâ*s*rapa*n*î of Udumbara wood, with (the
formula), 'I touch thee agreeable to the Fathers.'

3\. He sprinkles (the cow with water) with (the words), 'I sprinkle thee
agreeable to the Fathers.'

4. <span id="fr_690"></span>[4](#fn_690.md) When it has been sprinkled and
fire has been

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

carried round it, they kill it to the west of the fire, its head being
turned to the west, its feet to the south.

5. <span id="fr_691"></span>[5](#fn_691.md) After it has been killed, he
silently 'strengthens' its sense-organs (by touching them) with water,
and silently takes out the omentum, the heart, and the kidneys.

6\. With the Vapâ*s*rapa*n*î of Udumbara wood he roasts the omentum;
with spits of Udumbara wood the other (parts mentioned in Sûtra 5)
separately.

7\. After he has roasted them, and has sprinkled Â*g*ya over them, and
has taken them from the fire, he sprinkles water round (the fire) from
right to left, puts a piece of Udumbara wood on (the fire), and
sacrifices with a Darvi spoon of Udumbara wood the omentum, spreading
under and sprinkling over it (Â*g*ya), with (the verse), 'Carry the
omentum, *G*âtavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them resting
afar. May streams of fat flow to them; may their wishes with all their
desires be fulfilled. Svadhâ! Adoration!'

8. <span id="fr_692"></span>[8](#fn_692.md) He sacrifices the omentum
entirely. The other parts (Sûtra 5) he should offer to the Brâhma*n*as
and should feed them (with those parts of the cow).

9\. When the food (for the Brâhma*n*as) is ready, he cuts off (the
Avadânas) together from the mess of boiled rice, and from the pieces of
meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he makes oblations

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

thereof with the verses, 'Behold the Ekâsh*t*akâ, the giver of food with
meat and ghee, (which is offered) with (the word) svadhâ. By the
Brâhma*n*as that food is purified. May it be an imperishable (blessing)
to me! Svadhâ! Adoration!'

'The Ekâsh*t*akâ, devoting herself to austerities, the consort of the
year, exuberant (with milk), has poured forth milk. May you live on that
milk, O Fathers, all together. May this (food) be well offered and well
sacrificed by me! Svadhâ! Adoration!

'The image of the year' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. V, 7, 2, 1).

10\. After he has sacrificed, he cuts off (the Avadânas) from the food
and from the pieces of meat, and mixing them with clarified butter he
makes an oblation with (the formula), 'To Agni Kavyavâhana
Svish*t*ak*ri*t svadhâ! Adoration!'

11. <span id="fr_693"></span>[11](#fn_693) The known (rites.md) down to the
pouring out of the handfuls of water (are performed here) as at the
monthly (*S*râddha).

12. <span id="fr_694"></span>[12](#fn_694.md) The gifts of food and
presents, however, are not necessary here.

13. <span id="fr_695"></span>[13](#fn_695.md) On the following day, he
prepares food for the Fathers with the rest of the meat, and sacrifices
with (the two verses), 'Thou, Agni, art quick,' (and), Pra*g*âpati!'
(see above, I, 1, 3, 5).

14\. (= Sûtra 11).

End of the Fifth Pa*t*ala.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_689"></span>[234:2](sbe30087.htm#fr_689.md) 15, 2. On the
Vapâ*s*rapa*n*î, comp. Kâtyâyana VI, 5, 7; Â*s*val.-G*ri*hya I, II, 8.
Comp. besides, Taitt. Sa*m*h. VI, 3, 6; Âpastamba-*S*rauta-sûtra VII, 8,
3; 12, 5 seq.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[234:4](sbe30087.htm#fr_690.md) The Udî*k*yas
read, as Mât*ri*datta states, 'to the south of the fire.'

<span id="fn_691"></span>[235:5](sbe30087.htm#fr_691.md) On the
'strengthening' of the sense-organs of an immolated victim, comp.
Âpastamba-*S*rauta-sûtra VII, 18, 6 seq. Schwab, Thieropfer, 110.—On
matasne, see Indische Studien, IX, 248; Schwab 127.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[235:8](sbe30087.htm#fr_692.md) Possibly the
reading of the Udî*k*yas indicated by Mât*ri*datta, vyâk*ri*tya instead
of upâk*ri*tya, is correct. The translation would be, 'With the rest,
distributing it, &c.'

<span id="fn_693"></span>[236:11](sbe30087.htm#fr_693.md) See above, chap.
14, 10.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[236:12](sbe30087.htm#fr_694.md) See chap. 14, 9.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[236:13](sbe30087.htm#fr_695.md) This is the
so-called Anvash*t*akya ceremony.
