### PRA*S*NA I, PA*T*ALA 6, SECTION 20.

1. <span id="fr_614"></span>[1](#fn_614.md) Facing the east, while she
faces the west, or facing the west, while she faces the east, he should
seize her hand. If he desires to generate male children, let him seize
her thumb; if he desires (to generate) female children, her other
fingers; if he desires (to generate) both (male and female children),
let him seize the thumb together with the other fingers, (so as to seize
the hand) up to the hairs (on the hair-side of the hand).

(He should do so with the two Mantras),

'Sarasvatî! Promote this (our undertaking), O gracious one, rich in
studs, thou whom we sing first of all that is.

'I seize thy hand that we may be blessed with offspring, that thou mayst
live to old age with me, thy husband. Bhaga, Aryaman, Savit*ri*,
Purandhi, the gods have given thee to me that we may rule our house.'

2. <span id="fr_615"></span>[2](#fn_615.md) He makes her turn round, from
left to right, so that she faces the west, and recites over her (the
following texts),

'With no evil eye, not bringing death to thy husband, bring luck to the
cattle, be full of joy and

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

vigour. Give birth to living children, give birth to heroes, be
friendly. Bring us luck, to men and animals.

'Thus, Pûshan, lead her to us, the highly blessed one, into whom men
pour forth their sperm, yâ na ûrû u*s*atî visrayâtai (read,
vi*s*rayâtai), yasyâm u*s*anta*h* praharema *s*epam.

'Soma has acquired thee first (as his wife); after him the Gandharva has
acquired thee. Thy third husband is Agni; the fourth am I, thy human
husband.

'Soma has given her to the Gandharva; the Gandharva has given her to
Agni. Agni gives me cattle and children, and thee besides.

'This am I, that art thou; the heaven I, the earth thou; the Sâman I,
the *Rik* thou. Come! Let us join together. Let us unite our sperm that
we may generate a male child, a son, for the sake of the increase of
wealth, of blessed offspring, of strength.

'Bountiful Indra, bless this woman with sons and with a happy lot. Give
her ten sons; let her husband be the eleventh.'

3. <span id="fr_616"></span>[3](#fn_616.md) After he has made her sit down
in her proper place (see Sûtra 5 of the preceding section), and has
sprinkled Â*g*ya into her joined hands, he twice pours fried grain into
them, with (the verse), 'This grain I pour (into thy hands): may it
bring prosperity to me, and may it unite thee (with me). May this Agni
grant us that.'

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

4\. After he has sprinkled (Â*g*ya) over (the grain in her hands), he
sacrifices (the grain) with her joined hands (which he seizes), with
(the verse), 'This woman, strewing grain into the fire, prays thus, "May
my husband live long; may my relations be prosperous. Svâhâ!"'

5. <span id="fr_617"></span>[5](#fn_617.md) Having made her rise with (the
verse which she recites), 'Up! with life' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 2, 8, 1),
and having circumambulated the fire (with her) so that their right sides
are turned towards it, with (the verse), 'May we find our way with thee
through all hostile powers, as through streams of water'—he pours fried
grain (into her hands, and sacrifices them), as before.

6\. Having circumambulated (the fire) a second time, he pours fried
grain (into her hands, and sacrifices them), as before.

7\. Having circumambulated (the fire) a third time, he sacrifices to
(Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

8. <span id="fr_618"></span>[8](#fn_618.md) Here some add as subordinate
oblations the *G*aya, Abhyâtâna, and Râsh*t*rabh*ri*t (oblations) as
above.

9. <span id="fr_619"></span>[9](#fn_619.md) To the west of the fire he
makes her step forward in an easterly or a northerly direction the
(seven) 'steps of Vish*n*u.'

10\. He says to her, 'Step forward with the right (foot) and follow with
the left. Do not put the left (foot) before the right.'

*S*âṅkhâyana I, 13, 2; Â*s*valâyana I, 7, 3 seq., &c. The text of the
first Mantra ought to be corrected according to Pâraskara I, 7, 2; in
the second Mantra we ought to read yathâsa*h* instead of yathâsat; comp.
*Ri*g-veda X, 85, 36; Pâraskara I, 6, 3. The bridegroom and the bride,
of course, are to face each other; thus, if the bridegroom stands on the
eastern layer of grass (Sûtra 9 of the preceding section), he is to face
the west; if on the western, he is to face the east.

agre*n*a dakshi*n*am a*m*sam . . . abhyâvartya, evidently have the same
meaning which is expressed elsewhere (*S*âṅkhâyana <span
