part of the house with the next (II, 15, 14).

8\. The place for the water-barrel is to the south of that spot.

9\. He strews there Darbha grass, so that its points are turned in every
direction, pours rice and barley-grains over the (grass) with the next
(verse, II, 15, 15), and thereon he places the water-barrel.

10\. With the next (Ya*g*us, II, 15, 16) he pours four potfuls of water
into it.

11\. If (the barrel) breaks, he recites the next (verse, II, 15, 17)
over it.

12\. After the ceremonies from the putting of wood on the fire down to
the Â*g*yabhâga oblations have been performed, he offers the (four)
oblations (indicated by the) next (Mantras; II, 15, 18-21); then he
enters upon the performance of the *G*aya and following oblations.

13\. Having performed (the rites) down to the sprinkling (of water)
round (the fire), he should sprinkle (water) with a water-pot around the
house or the resting-place on the inside, with the next Ya*g*us (II, 15,
22) three times from left to right; then he should serve cakes, flour,
and boiled rice to the Brâhma*n*as.
