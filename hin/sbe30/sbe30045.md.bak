water) from west to east with (the words), 'Aditi! Give thy consent!'—

9\. On the west side, from south to north, with (the words), 'Anumati!
Give thy consent!' On the north side, from west to east, with (the

10\. On all sides, so as to keep his right side turned towards (the
fire), with (the Mantra), 'God Savit*ri*! Give thy impulse!' (Taitt.
Sa*m*h. I, 7, 7, 1).

11. <span id="fr_473"></span>[11](#fn_473) Having (thus.md) sprinkled
(water) round (the fire), and having anointed the fuel (with Â*g*ya), he
puts it on (the fire) with (the Mantra), 'This fuel is thy self,
*G*âtavedas! Thereby thou shalt be inflamed and shalt grow. Inflame us
and make us grow; through offspring, cattle, holy lustre, and through
the enjoyment of food make us increase. Svâhâ!'

12\. He then sacrifices with the (spoon called) Darvi (the following
oblations):

13. <span id="fr_474"></span>[13](#fn_474.md) Approaching the Darvi (to the
fire) by the northerly junction of the pegs (laid round the fire), and
fixing his mind on (the formula), 'To Pra*g*âpati, to Manu svâhâ!'
(without pronouncing that Mantra), he sacrifices a straight, long,
uninterrupted (stream of Â*g*ya), directed towards the south-east.

14\. Approaching the Darvi (to the fire) by the southern junction of the
pegs (laid round the fire),

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (he sacrifices) a
straight (stream of Â*g*ya), directed towards the northeast, with (the
Mantra which he pronounces), 'To Indra svâhâ!'

15\. Having (thus) poured out the two Âghâra oblations, he sacrifices
the two Â*g*yabhâgas,

16. <span id="fr_475"></span>[16](#fn_475) With (the words.md), 'To Agni
svâhâ!' over the easterly part of the northerly part (of the fire); with
(the words), 'To Soma svâhâ!' over the easterly part of the southerly
part (of the fire).

17. <span id="fr_476"></span>[17](#fn_476.md) Between them he sacrifices
the other (oblations).

18. <span id="fr_477"></span>[18](#fn_477.md) (He makes four oblations with
the following Mantras): 'Thou whom we have set to work, *G*âtavedas!
carry forward (our offerings). Agni! Perceive this work (i.e. the
sacrifice), as it is performed (by us). Thou art a healer, a creator of
medicine. Through thee may we obtain cows, horses, and men. Svâhâ!

'Thou who liest down athwart, thinking, "It is I who keep (all things)
asunder:" to thee who art propitious (to me), I sacrifice this stream of
ghee in the fire. Svâhâ!

'To the propitious goddess svâhâ!

'To the accomplishing goddess svâhâ!'
