### PA*T*ALA 2, SECTION 6.

1\. The next (verse; M. I, 6, 13), he recites over a boat (with which
they are going to cross a river).

2\. And let the wife, when she is crossing, not see the crew.

3\. When they have crossed, let him murmur the next (verse; M. I, 6,
14).

4\. If they have to pass over a cemetery, or if any article (which they
carry with them), or their chariot is damaged, the ceremonies from the
putting of wood on the fire down to the Â*g*yabhâga oblations are
performed, and while she takes hold of him, he offers the oblations
(indicated by the) next (Mantras; M. I, 7, 1-7), then he enters upon the
performance of the *G*aya and following oblations, and performs (the
rites) down to the sprinkling (of water) round (the fire).

5\. If they pass by trees with milky sap or by other trees that serve as
marks, by rivers or by deserts, he should murmur the next two (verses;
M. I, 7, 8. 9), according to the characteristics in them (which refer to
these different cases).

6\. With the next (verse) he shows her the house(M. I, 7, 10).

7\. With the next two (verses; M. I, 7, 11. 12) he unyokes the two
animals; the right one first.

8\. Having, with the next (verse; M. I, 8, 1), spread out, in the centre
of the house, a red bull's skin with the neck to the east, with the hair
up, he causes her to recite the next (verse; M. I, 8, 2), while he makes
her enter the house, (which she does) with her right foot.

9\. And she does not stand on the threshold.

10\. In the north-east part of the house the ceremonies from the putting
of wood on the fire down to the Â*g*yabhâga oblations are performed, and
while she takes hold of him, he offers the oblations (indicated by the)
next (Mantras; M. I, 8, 3-15); then he enters upon the performance of
the Gaya and following oblations, and performs (the rites) down to the
sprinkling (of water) round (the fire). Then they sit down with the next
(verse; M. I, 9, 1) on the skin, the bridegroom to the north.

11\. He then places with the next (verse; M. I, 9, 2), the son of a wife
who has only sons and whose children are alive, in her lap, gives fruits
to the (child) with the next Ya*g*us (M. I, 9, 3), and murmurs the next
*t*wo (verses; M. I, 9, 4-5). Then he (and his wife) observe silence
until the stars appear.

12\. When the stars have appeared, he goes out (of the house with her)
in an easterly or northerly direction, and shows her the polar star and
(the star) Arundhatî with the next two verses (M. I, 9, 6-7), according
to the characteristics (contained in those verses).
