# G*RI*HYA-SÛTRA OF GOBHILA.

### PRAPÂ*TH*AKA I, KÂ*ND*IKÂ 1.

1. <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95) Now henceforth we shall explain
the domestic sacrifices.

2\. He should perform (the ceremonies) wearing the sacrificial cord on
his left shoulder and having sipped water.

3\. During the northern course of the sun, at the time of the increasing
moon, on an auspicious day, before noon: this he should know as the
(proper) time (for performing the ceremonies).

4\. And as the prescription (is stated with regard to the time of the
single ceremonies).

5. <span id="fr_96"></span>[5](#fn_96) All (ceremonies) are accompanied
by the Anvâhârya (*S*râddha).

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

6. <span id="fr_97"></span>[6](#fn_97) At the end (of each ceremony) he
should feed worthy (Brâhma*n*as) according to his ability.

7. <span id="fr_98"></span>[7](#fn_98) A student, after he has studied
the Veda, when going to put the last piece of wood (on the fire),—

8\. Or to seize a wife's hand (i.e. to marry her),—

9. <span id="fr_99"></span>[9](#fn_99) Should fetch water from a hidden
place, should sweep a place which is inclined towards north-east, or
which is level, and should besmear it (with cow-dung). Beginning from
the centre of it he should draw a line from west to east, (another line)
from south to north which touches that line at its western end, and
three lines from west to east (touching the northwards-turned line at
three different points) in its midst (i.e. at neither of its ends). He
then should besprinkle (those lines with water).

10\. In this way the Laksha*n*a (i.e. the preparation of the place for
the sacred fire) is performed everywhere.

11\. With the words 'Bhûr, bhuva*h*, sva*h*,' they carry the fire
forward (to that place) so that they have it in front of them.

12. <span id="fr_100"></span>[12](#fn_100) Or after the householder has
died, the chief

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (of the family)
should do it (i.e. he should set up the sacred fire).

13\. In this way, on the coincidence of an (auspicious) Tithi and an
(auspicious) Nakshatra, (or of such a Nakshatra) and a Parvan—

14\. On the full-moon day or on the new-moon day: then he should
celebrate the setting up of his (sacred domestic) fire.

15. <span id="fr_101"></span>[15](#fn_101) He should get fire from a
Vai*s*ya's house or from a frying-pan, and should set it up (as his
sacred fire);

16\. Or (he should fetch it) from the house of one who offers many
sacrifices, be it a Brâhma*n*a, or a Râ*g*anya, or a Vai*s*ya.

17\. Or he may kindle another fire by attrition and may set it up.

18\. That is pure, but it does not bring prosperity.

19\. He may do what he likes (of the things stated as admissible in the
last Sûtras.

20. <span id="fr_102"></span>[20](#fn_102) When he puts (at the end of
his studentship) the last piece of wood (on the fire), or when he
sacrifices when going to seize the hand of a wife, that fire he should
keep.

21\. That becomes his (sacred) domestic fire.

22. <span id="fr_103"></span>[22](#fn_103) Thereby his morning oblation
has been offered.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

23. <span id="fr_104"></span>[23](#fn_104) Beginning from that time the
sacrificing (of regular morning and evening oblations) in the domestic
fire is prescribed, so that he begins with an evening oblation.

24\. Before the time has come for setting the fire in a blaze, he should
fetch in the evening and in the morning from a hidden place the water
with which the different acts (such as sipping water) are performed.

25\. Or (he should fetch water only) in the evening.

26\. Or he should draw it out of a water-pot or of a barrel.

27. <span id="fr_105"></span>[27](#fn_105) Before sunset he should set
the fire in a blaze, and sacrifice the evening oblation after sunset.

28\. In the morning he should set the fire in a blaze before sunrise,
and should sacrifice the morning oblation before sunrise or after it.

Khâdira-G*ri*hya I, 1, 1. 2. 5. 7.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[13:5](sbe30004.htm#fr_96) I cannot give this
translation of the words 'sarvâ*n*y evânvâhâryavanti' without expressing
my doubts as to whether the commentator, whom I have followed, is right.
He says: 'anu pa*sk*âd âhriyate yasmât prak*ri*ta*m* karma iti, anu
pa*sk*âd âhriyate yat prastutât (prak*ri*tât?) karma*n*a iti
*k*ânvâhârya*m* nândîmukha*s*râddha*m* dakshi*n*â *k*o*k*yate.' It is
evident that the first explanation of anvâhârya as a ceremony after
which the chief sacrifice follows, is inadmissible. Below, IV, 4, 3. 4,
Gobhila himself defines the Anvâhârya *S*râddha as a monthly ceremony
(comp. Manu III, 123; Max Müller, India, p. 240); it is, consequently,
different from a *S*râddha accompanying each G*ri*hya sacrifice. The
*S*loka which the commentary quotes from a 'g*ri*hyântara' seems to me
not to remove the doubt; I think rather that it contains a speculation
based on this very passage of Gobhila, taken in the sense in <span
id="page_14">p. 14</span> which the commentator takes it, and on the
Sûtras IV, 4, 3. 4. Thus I rather believe that we ought to understand
anvâhârya as a mess of food like that offered after the
dar*s*apûr*n*amâsau sacrifices to the officiating priests (Hillebrandt,
Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, 133), and I propose to translate: All
(sacrifices) are followed by (the offering of) the Anvâhârya food (to
the priest).

the paramesh*th*î is the same person as the *g*yâyan. The commentary
gives a different explanation: paramesh*th*î agnir ity â*k*akshate,

oblations of fried grain, &c., prescribed for the wedding, are
considered as the sacrificer's morning oblation in his newly-established
G*ri*hya fire, so that the regular oblations have to begin with the
sâyamâhuti.
