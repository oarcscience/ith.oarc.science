### PA*T*ALA 6, SECTION 21.

1\. (He makes her step forward, and goes with her himself), with (the
Mantras), 'One (step) for sap, may Vish*n*u go after thee; two (steps)
for juice, may Vish*n*u go after thee; three (steps) for vows, may
Vish*n*u go after thee; four (steps) for comfort, may Vish*n*u go after
thee; five (steps) for cattle, may Vish*n*u go after thee; six (steps)
for the prospering of wealth, may Vish*n*u go after thee; seven (steps)
for the sevenfold Hot*ri*ship, may Vish*n*u go after thee.'

2\. After the seventh step he makes her abide (in that position) and
murmurs, 'With seven steps we have become friends. May I attain to
friendship with thee. May I not be separated from thy friendship. Mayst
thou not be separated from my friendship.'

3. <span id="fr_620"></span>[3](#fn_620.md) He then puts his right foot on
her right foot, moves his right hand down gradually over her right
shoulder, and touches the place of her heart as above,

4. <span id="fr_621"></span>[4](#fn_621.md) And the place of her navel with
(the formula), 'Thou art the knot of all breath; do not loosen thyself.'

5. <span id="fr_622"></span>[5](#fn_622.md) After he has made her sit down
to the west of the fire, so that she faces the east, he stands to the
east (of his bride), facing the west, and besprinkles her with water,
with the three verses, 'O waters, ye are wholesome' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV,
I, 5, 1), with the four verses, 'The gold-coloured, clean, purifying
waters' (V, 6, 1), and with the Anuvâka, 'The purifier, the heavenly
one' (Taitt. Brâhma*n*a I, 4, 8).

6. <span id="fr_623"></span>[6](#fn_623.md) Now they pour seeds (of rice,
&c.) on (the heads of the bridegroom and bride).
