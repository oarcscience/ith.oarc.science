### Footnotes

<span id="fn_259"></span>[69:1](sbe30023.htm#fr_259.md) 1, 1. After the
description of the regular Upanayana here follow, in chaps. 1 and 2,
statements regarding the special Vratas which the Vedic student has to
undergo, or rather which he may undergo, in the time of his studentship.
Comp. the corresponding statements on the Vratas of the *Ri*gvedins,
*S*âṅkhâyana-G*ri*hya II, 11 and 12. By the followers of the Sâma-veda
the ceremony of the Godâna, or cutting of the beard (comp. *S*âṅkhâyana
I, 28, 19; Pâraskara II, 1, 7 seq.; Â*s*valâyana I, 18), was put into
connection with their system of Vratas; the undergoing of the
Godânavrata enabled the student to study the Pûrvâr*k*ika of the
Sâma-veda. In the commentary on Gobhila III, 1, 28 we find the following
statements with regard to this Vrata as well as to the other Vratas
mentioned in Sûtra 28: 'The Upanayana-vrata has been declared to refer
to the study of the Sâvitrî (comp. Bloomfield's notes on
G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha II, 42. 43); the Godâna-vrata, to the study of the
collections of verses sacred to the gods Agni, Indra, and Soma Pavamâna
(this is the Pûrvâr*k*ika of the Sâma-veda); the Vrâtika-vrata, to the
study of the Âra*n*yaka, with the exclusion of the *S*ukriya sections;
the Âditya-vrata, to the study of the *S*ukriya sections; the
Aupanishada-vrata, to the study of the Upanishad-Brâhma*n*a; the
*G*yaish*th*asâmika-vrata, to the study of the Â*g*yadohas.' The Vratas
were connected with a repetition of the Upanayana ceremony (Sûtras 10
seq.) in the way stated in my note on *S*âṅkhâyana II, 12,
1.—Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 5, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[69:2](sbe30023.htm#fr_260.md) Comp. *S*âṅkhâyana
I, 28, 19, 'The Godânakarman is identical with the *K*û*d*âkarman.'
Pâraskara II, 1, 7, At the Ke*s*ânta ceremony he says, "Hair and beard"
(instead of "hair," as at the *K*û*d*âkara*n*a).'

<span id="fn_261"></span>[70:3](sbe30023.htm#fr_261.md) At the
*K*û*d*âkara*n*a the child sits in the mother's lap and others perform
the rites for him.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[70:10](sbe30023.htm#fr_262.md) See the note on
Sûtra 1.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[70:11](sbe30023.htm#fr_263.md) Comp. above, II,
10, 7.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[71:28](sbe30023.htm#fr_264.md) The meaning of
these expressions has been explained in the note on Sûtra 1.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[71:30](sbe30023.htm#fr_265.md) According to the
commentary some study the *S*ukriyas as a part of the Âra*n*yaka; these
do not undergo the Âditya-vrata. Others, for instance the Kauthumas,
separate the *S*ukriyas from the Âra*n*yaka and keep a special vow, the
Âditya-vrata, by which they are enabled to study those texts.
