### PA*T*ALA 8, SECTION 28.

1. <span id="fr_642"></span>[1](#fn_642.md) The two verses commencing
'Vâstoshpati!' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. III, 4, 10, 1).

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

'Vâstoshpati! Be our furtherer; make our wealth increase in cows and
horses, O Indu (i.e. Soma). Free from decay may we dwell in thy
friendship; give us thy favour, as a father to his sons. Svâhâ!

'May death go away; may immortality come to us. May Vivasvat's son
(Mama) protect us from danger. May wealth, like a leaf (that falls) from
a tree, fall down over us. May *S*a*k*îpati (i.e. Indra) be with us.
Svâhâ!

'Go another way, O death, that belongs to thee, separated from the way
of the gods. Vâstoshpati! To thee who hears us, I speak: do no harm to
our offspring nor to our heroes. Svâhâ!

'To this most excellent place of rest we have gone, by which we shall
victoriously gain cows, treasures, and horses. May wealth, like a leaf
(that falls) from a tree, fall down over us. May Sa*k*îpati be with us.
Svâhâ!

'This, O Varu*n*a' (&c.; see chap. 27, Sûtra 1, down to): 'Hail! Good
luck!'

2\. In this way the ground (on which the house stands) should be
expiated every year;

3\. Every season, according to some (teachers).
