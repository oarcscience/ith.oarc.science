drop of curds (on those grains). That he gives her to eat.

5\. After she has sipped water, he touches her belly with (the formula),

a fire that has been kindled by attrition, and inserts that into the
right nostril of (the wife) whose head rests on the widely spread root

7\. If she miscarries, he should three times stroke (her body), from the
navel upwards, with her wet hand, with (the formula), 'Thitherwards, not
hitherwards, may Tvash*tri* bind thee in his bonds. Making (the mother)
enter upon the seasons, live ten months (in thy mother's womb); do not
bring death to men.'

8. <span id="fr_648"></span>[8](#fn_648.md) When her confinement has come,
he performs the kshipraprasavana (i.e. the ceremony for accelerating the
confinement). Having placed a water-pot near her head and a Tûryantî
plant near her feet, he touches her belly.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_646"></span>[209:2](sbe30074.htm#fr_646.md) 2, 2. Comp. the
note on Â*s*valâyana I, 13, 2.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[209:6](sbe30074.htm#fr_647.md) The translation of
this Sûtra should be considered merely as tentative. Some words of the
text are uncertain, and the remarks of Mât*ri*datta are very incorrectly
given in the MSS.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[210:8](sbe30074.htm#fr_648.md) Comp.
Âpastamba-G*ri*hya VI, 14, 14; Â*s*valâyana II, 8, 14; IV, 4, 8.
