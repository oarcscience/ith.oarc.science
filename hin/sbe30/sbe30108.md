### PA*T*ALA 6, SECTION 15.

1. <span id="fr_769"></span>[1](#fn_769) After he has touched the
new-born child with the Vâtsapra hymn (Taitt. Sa*m*h. IV, 2, 2; M. II,
11, 20), and has taken him on his lap with the next Ya*g*us (M. II, II,
21), with the next (three) (verses—II, 11, 22; 12, 1. 2—one by one) he
addresses the child, kisses him on his head, and murmurs (the third
verse) into his right ear.

2\. And he gives him a Nakshatra name.

3\. That is secret.

4\. He pours together honey and ghee; into this (mixture) he dips a
piece of gold which he has tied with a noose to a Darbha blade. With the
next (three) formulas (II, 12, 3-5) he gives the boy (by

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

means of the piece of gold, some of the mixture) to eat. With the next
five (verses, II, 12, 6-10) he bathes him. Then he pours curds and ghee
together and gives him this (mixture which is called) 'sprinkled butter'
(p*ri*shadâ*g*ya) to eat out of a brass vessel, with the Vyâh*ri*tis to
which the syllable 'Om' is added as the fourth (II, 12, 11-14). The
remainder he should mix with water and pour out in a cow-stable.

5\. With the next (verse, M. II, 13, 1) he places (the child) in the
mother's lap; with the next (II, 13, 2) he causes her to give him her
right breast; with the next two (verses, II, 13, 3. 4) he touches the
earth, and after (the child) has been laid down, (he touches him) with
the next (formula, II, 13, 5).

6\. With the next Ya*g*us (II, 13, 6) he places a water-pot at (the
child's) head, sacrifices mustard seeds and rice-chaff with his joined
hands three times with each of the next (formulas, II, 13, 7-14, 2),
repeating each time the word Svâhâ, and says (to the people who are
accustomed to enter the room in which his wife lies), 'Whenever you
enter, strew silently (mustard seeds with rice-chaff) on the fire.'

7\. This is to be done until the ten days (after the child's birth) have
elapsed.

8\. On the tenth day, after (the mother) has risen and taken a bath, he
gives a name to the son. The father and the mother (should pronounce
that name first).

9\. (It should be a name) of two syllables or of four syllables; the
first part should be a noun; the second a verb; it should have a long
vowel (or) the Visarga at the end, should begin with a sonant, and
contain a semi-vowel.

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

10, Or it should contain the particle su, for such a name has a firm
foundation; thus it is said in a Brâhma*n*a.

11\. A girl's name should have an odd number of syllables.

12. <span id="fr_770"></span>[12](#fn_770) When (the father) returns
from a journey, he should address the child and kiss him on his head
with the next two (verses, M. II, 14, 3. 4), and should murmur the next
Mantras (II, 14, 5) into his right ear.

13\. With the next Ya*g*us (II, 14, 6) he addresses a daughter (when
returning from a journey).
