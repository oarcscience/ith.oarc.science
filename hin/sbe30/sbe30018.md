### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 6.

1. <span id="fr_221"></span>[1](#fn_221.md) The beginning of the third
month of pregnancy is the time for the Pu*m*savana (i.e. the ceremony to
secure the birth of a son).

2\. In the morning, after she has been washed, sitting on
northward-pointed Darbha grass, (all over her body) including her head,
she sits down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass,
facing the east.

3\. Her husband, standing behind her, should grasp down with his right
hand over her right shoulder, and should touch the uncovered place of
her navel with the verse, 'The two men, Mitra and Varu*n*a' (MB. I, 4,
8).

4\. Then they may do what they like.

5\. Then afterwards (the following ceremony should be performed).

6\. In a north-easterly direction, having bought for three times seven
barley corns or beans a Nyagrodha shoot which. has fruits on both sides,
which is not dry and not touched by worms, he should set that up.

7 <span id="fr_222"></span>[7](#fn_222) (He buys it with the Mantras.md):

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

'If thou belongest to Soma, I buy thee for the king Soma.

'If thou belongest to Varu*n*a, I buy thee for the king Varu*n*a.

'If thou belongest to the Vasus, I buy thee for the Vasus.

'If thou belongest to the Rudras, I buy thee for the Rudras.

'If thou belongest to the Âdityas, I buy thee for the Âdityas.

'If thou belongest to the Maruts, I buy thee for the Maruts.

'If thou belongest to the Vi*s*ve devâs, I buy thee for the Vi*s*ve
devâs.'

8\. He should set it up with (the Mantra), 'Ye herbs, being well-minded,
bestow strength on this (shoot); for it will do its work.' Then he
should put grass around it, should take it, and place it in the open
air.

9\. Having washed a nether mill-stone, a student or a (wife) addicted
(to her husband), a person who is a Brâhma*n*a by birth (only and not by
learning), or a girl, pounds (that Nyagrodha shoot) without moving
backward (the stone with which she pounds it).

10\. In the morning, after she has been washed, sitting on
northward-pointed Darbha grass, (all over her body), including her head,
she lies down to the west of the fire on northward-pointed Darbha grass,
with her head to the east.

11\. Her husband, standing behind her, should seize (the pounded
Nyagrodha shoot) with the

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

thumb and the fourth finger of his right hand, and should insert it into
her right nostril with the verse, 'A man is Agni, a man is Indra' (MB.
I, 4, 9).

12\. Then they should do what they like.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_221"></span>[52:1](sbe30018.htm#fr_221.md) 6, 1 seq. The
Pu*m*savana. Khâdira-G*ri*hya II, 2, 17 seq. On âdisade*s*e the
commentary says, âdisade*s*e âdisamîpaprade*s*e prathame t*ri*tîyabhâge,
ity etat. âdimade*s*a iti pâ*th*e vyakta evârtha*h*. To me it seems
probable that âdimade*s*e is the true reading.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[52:7](sbe30018.htm#fr_222.md) The first Mantra
consists of seven sections; with each of <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>
these sections he should, according to the commentary, give three barley
corns or beans to the owner of the Nyagrodha tree, or put them down at
the root of the tree.
