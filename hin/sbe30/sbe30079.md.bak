### PRA*S*NA II, PA*T*ALA 2, SECTION 7.

1. <span id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_664) Now (follows.md) the expiation for
attacks of the dog-demon (epilepsy) (on the boy).

2. <span id="fr_665"></span>[2](#fn_665.md) When the attack assails (the
boy, the performer of the ceremony) arranges his sacrificial cord over
his left shoulder, sips water, and fetches water with a cup that has not
yet been used (in order to pour it upon the boy). In the middle of the
hall he elevates (the earth at) that place in which they use to gamble;
he besprinkles it with water, casts the dice, scatters them (on all
sides), makes a heap of them, spreads them out, makes an opening in the
thatched roof of the hall, takes the boy in through that (opening), lays
him on his back on the dice, and pours a mixture of curds and salt-water
upon him, while they beat a gong towards the south. (The curds and water
are poured on the sick boy with the following Mantras),

'Kurkura, Sukurkura, the Kurkura with the dark fetter . . . .

'Sârameya runs about, looking, as it were, upon the sea. He, the
Suvîri*n*a (?), wears golden ornaments on his neck and on his breast,
the most excellent (ornaments) of dogs (?).

'Suvîri*n*a, let him loose! Let him loose, Ekavrâtya! Let him loose,
doggy! Let him loose, *Kh*at!

'*T*eka and Sasarama*t*a*m*ka and Tûla and Vitûla and the white one and
the red one. Let him loose! . . . . the brown and red one.

'On those two single ones the sarasyakâs (?) run

down in the third heaven from here. *Kh*at! Go away. Sîsarama! Sârameya!
Adoration to thee, Sîsara!

'Your mother is called the messenger; your father is the ma*nd*âkaka
(ma*nd*ûkaka, the frog?). *Kh*at! Go away, &c.

'Your mother is called dulâ (the staggering one?); your father is the
ma*nd*âkaka. *Kh*at! Go away, &c.

'The stallions (stamp with) their feet. Do not gnash (?) thy teeth.
*Kh*at! Go away, &c.

'The carpenter hammers at (the chariots) that have wheels (?). Do not
gnash (?) thy teeth. *Kh*at! Go away,' &c.

3\. Then (the performer of the ceremony) says, 'Choose a boon.'

4\. (The father or brother of the boy replies), 'I choose the boy.'

5. <span id="fr_666"></span>[5](#fn_666.md) They should do so, when the
attack assails him, three times in the day, in the morning, at noon, and
in the afternoon, and when he has recovered.

End of the Second Pa*t*ala.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[219:2](sbe30079.htm#fr_665.md) The Mantras are
partly unintelligible. As to kurkura comp. the note on Pâraskara I, 16,
24.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[220:5](sbe30079.htm#fr_666.md) There can be
little doubt as to the correctness of the reading agada*h* instead of
âgata*h*.
