*The Grihya Sutras, Part 2 (SBE30)*, by Hermann Oldenberg, \[1892\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PA*T*ALA 1, SECTION 2.

1\. He warms at the fire the implement with which he sacrifices, wipes
it off with Darbha blades, warms it again, sprinkles it (with water),
puts it down, touches the Darbha blades with water, and throws them into
the fire.

2. <span id="fr_718"></span>[2](#fn_718.md) As paridhis (or pieces of wood
laid round the fire) yoke-pins are used at the marriage, the Upanayana,
the Samâvartana, the parting of the (wife's) hair, the tonsure of the
child's hair, the cutting of the beard, and at expiatory ceremonies.

3\. He sprinkles water round the fire, on the south side from west to
east with (the words), 'Aditi, give thy consent!' on the west side from
south to north with 'Anumati, give thy consent!' on the north side from
west to east with 'Sarasvatî \[sic\], give thy consent!' all around with
'God Sâvitrî, give thy impulse!'

4\. At ceremonies belonging to the Fathers (water is sprinkled) only all
round (the fire), silently.

5. <span id="fr_719"></span>[5](#fn_719.md) Having put a piece of wood on
the fire, he

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

offers the two Âghâra oblations as at the sacrifices of the new and full
moon, silently.

6. <span id="fr_720"></span>[6](#fn_720.md) Then he offers the two
Â*g*yabhâga oblations, over the easterly part of the northerly part (of
the fire) with (the words), 'To Agni Svâhâ!' over the easterly part of
the southerly part (another oblation) exactly like the preceding one,
with (the words), 'To Soma Svâhâ!'

7. <span id="fr_721"></span>[7](#fn_721.md) Having offered the chief
oblations (belonging to each sacrifice) according to prescription, he
adds the following oblations, viz. the *G*aya, Abhyâtâna,
Râsh*t*rabh*ri*t oblations, the oblation to Pra*g*âpati, the Vyâh*ri*tis
one by one, the oblation to (Agni) Svish*t*ak*ri*t with (the following
formula), 'What I have done too much in this ceremony, or what I have
done here too little, all that may Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t, he who knows,
make well sacrificed and well offered. Svâhâ!'

8. <span id="fr_722"></span>[8](#fn_722) The sprinkling (of water.md) round
(the fire is repeated) as above; the Mantras are altered so as to say,
'Thou hast given thy consent,' 'Thou hast given thy impulse.'

9\. The designation 'Pâkaya*gñ*a' is used of ceremonies connected with
worldly life.

10. <span id="fr_723"></span>[10](#fn_723.md) There the ritual based on the
Brâhma*n*a (holds good),

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

11. <span id="fr_724"></span>[11](#fn_724) (To which the words allude.md),
'He sacrifices twice; he wipes off (his hand) twice; he partakes twice
(of the sacrificial food); having gone away he sips (out of the Sru*k*)
and licks off (the Sru*k*).'

12\. All seasons are fit for marriage with the exception of the two
months of the *s*i*s*ira season, and of the last summer month.

13\. All Nakshatras which are stated to be pure, (are fit for marriage);

14\. And all auspicious performances.

15\. And one should learn from women what ceremonies (are required by
custom).

16. <span id="fr_725"></span>[16](#fn_725.md) Under the Invakâs
(Nakshatra), (the wooers who go to the girl's father) are sent out: such
wooers are welcome.

another ritual based on the Brâhma*n*a, and more especially on the
treatment of the Agnihotra in the Brâhma*n*a, may be used in its stead.
