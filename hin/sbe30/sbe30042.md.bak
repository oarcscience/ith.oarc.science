------------------------------------------------------------------------

### KÂ*ND*IKÂ. 10.

1. <span id="fr_444"></span>[1](#fn_444.md) To the north of the place (in
which the Arghya reception will be offered to a guest), they should bind
a cow (to a post or the like), and should (reverentially) approach it
with (the verse), 'Arha*n*â putra vâsa' (MB. II, 8, 1).

2. <span id="fr_445"></span>[2](#fn_445.md) (The guest to whom the Arghya
reception is going to be offered) should come forward murmuring, 'Here I
tread on this Padyâ Virâ*g* for the sake of the enjoyment of food'
(ibid. 2).

3\. (He should do so) where they are going to perform the Arghya
ceremony for him,

4\. Or when they perform it.

5\. Let them announce three times (to the guest) separately (each of the
following things which are

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

brought to him): a bed (of grass to sit down on), water for washing the
feet, the Argha water, water for sipping, and the Madhuparka (i.e. a
mixture of ghee, curds, and honey).

6\. Let him spread out the bed (of grass, so that the points of the
grass are) turned to the north, with (the verse), 'The herbs which' (MB.
II, 8, 3), and let him sit down thereon;

7\. If there are two (beds of grass), with the two (verses) separately
(MB. II, 8, 3. 4);

8. <span id="fr_446"></span>[8](#fn_446) On the second (he treads.md) with
the feet.

9\. Let him look at the water (with which he is to wash his feet), with
(the formula), 'From which side I see the goddesses' (ibid. 5).

10\. Let him wash his left foot with (the formula), 'The left foot I
wash;' let him wash his right foot with (the formula), 'The right foot I
wash' (MB. II. 8, 6. 7);

11. <span id="fr_447"></span>[11](#fn_447.md) Both with the rest (of the
Mantra, i.e. with the formula), 'First the one, then the other' (II, 8,
8).

12\. Let him accept the Arghya water with (the formula), 'Thou art the
queen of food' (ibid. 9).

13\. The water (offered to him) for sipping he should sip with (the
formula), 'Glory art thou' (ibid. 10).

14\. The Madhuparka he should accept with (the formula), 'The glory's
glory art thou' (ibid. 11).

15. <span id="fr_448"></span>[15](#fn_448) Let him drink (of it.md) three
times with (the

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

formula which he repeats thrice), 'The glory's food art thou; the
might's food art thou; the bliss's food art thou; bestow bliss on me'
(MB. II, 8, 12);

16. <span id="fr_449"></span>[16](#fn_449.md) Silently a fourth time.

17\. Having drunk more of it, he should give the remainder to a
Brâhma*n*a.

18\. After he has sipped water, the barber should thrice say to him, 'A
cow!'

19. <span id="fr_450"></span>[19](#fn_450.md) He should reply, 'Let loose
the cow from the fetter of Varu*n*a; bind (with it) him who hates me.
Kill him and (the enemy) of N.N., (the enemies) of both (myself and
N.N.). Deliver the cow; let it eat grass, let it drink water' (MB. II,
8, 13).

20\. (And after the cow has been set at liberty), let him address it
with (the verse), 'The mother of the Rudras' (MB. II, 8, 14).

21. <span id="fr_451"></span>[21](#fn_451.md) Thus if it is no sacrifice
(at which the Arghya reception is offered),

22\. (He should say), 'Make it (ready),' if it is a sacrifice.

23\. There are six persons to whom the Arghya reception is due,
(namely),

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

24. <span id="fr_452"></span>[24](#fn_452.md) A teacher, an officiating
priest, a Snâtaka, a king, the father-in-law, a friend coming as a
guest.

25. <span id="fr_453"></span>[25](#fn_453.md) They should offer the Arghya
reception (to such persons not more than) once a year.

26\. But repeatedly in the case of a sacrifice and of a wedding. But
repeatedly in the case of a sacrifice and of a wedding.

End of the Fourth Prapâ*th*aka.

End of the Gobhila-G*ri*hya-sûtra.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_444"></span>[129:1](sbe30042.htm#fr_444.md) 10, 1 seq. The
Arghya reception; Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV, 4, 5 seq.; G*ri*hya-sa*m*graha
II, 62-65. The first words of the Mantra quoted in Sûtra 1 are corrupt.
The Mantra is evidently an adaptation of the well-known verse addressed
to the Âgrahâya*n*î (Gobhila III, 9, 9; Mantra-Brâhma*n*a II, 2, 1), or
to the Ash*t*akâ (Pâraskara III, 3, 5, 8): prathamâ ha vyuvâsa, &c. The
first word arha*n*â ('duly'), containing an allusion to the occasion of
the Arghya ceremony, to which this Mantra is adapted, seems to be quite
right; the third word may be, as Dr. Knauer conjectures, uvâsa ('she has
dwelt,' or perhaps rather 'she has shone'). For the second word I am not
able to suggest a correction.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[129:2](sbe30042.htm#fr_445.md) Regarding Padyâ
Virâ*g*, comp. *S*âṅkhâyana III, 7, 5 note; Pâraskara I, 3, 12.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[130:8](sbe30042.htm#fr_446.md) See Pâraskara I,
3, 9.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[130:11](sbe30042.htm#fr_447.md) The commentary
says, *s*eshe*n*âva*s*ish*t*enodakena. Comp., however, Khâdira-G*ri*hya
IV, 4, II.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[130:15](sbe30042.htm#fr_448.md) I have adopted
the reading *s*rîbhaksho, which is given in the Mantra-Brâhma*n*a, and
have followed the opinion of the commentator <span id="page_131">p.
131</span> that the whole Mantra, and not its single parts, should be
repeated each time that he drinks of the Madhuparka. In the
Khâdira-G*ri*hya the text of the Mantra differs, and the rite is
described differently (IV, 4, 15).

<span id="fn_449"></span>[131:16](sbe30042.htm#fr_449.md) 16, 17. Perhaps
these two Sûtras should be rather understood as forming one Sûtra, and
should be translated as I have done in Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV, 4, 16.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[131:19](sbe30042.htm#fr_450.md) Iti after
abhidhehi ought to be omitted. Comp. the lengthy discussions on this
word, pp. 766 seq. of the edition of Gobhila in the Bibliotheca Indica.
'N.N.' is the host who offers the Arghya; comp. Khâdira-G*ri*hya IV, 4,
18.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[131:21](sbe30042.htm#fr_451.md) 21, 22. In the
case of a sacrifice the cow is killed; comp. *S*âṅkhâyana II, 15, 2. 3
note; Pâraskara I, 3, 30.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[132:24](sbe30042.htm#fr_452.md) Vivâhya is
explained in the commentary by vivâhayitavyo *g*âmâtâ. Comp., however,
*S*âṅkhâyana II, 15, 1 note.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[132:25](sbe30042.htm#fr_453.md) 25, 26. Comp.
*S*âṅkhâyana II, 15, 10 and the note.
