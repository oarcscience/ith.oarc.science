### PA*T*ALA 4, SECTION 11.

1. <span id="fr_679"></span>[1](#fn_679.md) 'The Fathers who are here and
who are not here, and whom we know and whom we do not know: Agni, to
thee they are known, how many they are, *G*âtavedas. May they enjoy what
thou givest them in our oblation. Svadhâ! Adoration!

'Your limb that this flesh-devouring (Agni) has burnt, leading you to
the worlds (of the Fathers), *G*âtavedas, that I restore to you again.
Unviolated with all your limbs arise, O Fathers! Svadhâ! Adoration!

'Carry the Â*g*ya, *G*âtavedas, to the Fathers, where thou knowest them
resting afar. May streams of Â*g*ya flow to them; may their wishes with
all their desires be fulfilled! Svadhâ! Adoration!'

In the same way a second and a third verse with the alteration of the
Mantra, 'to the grandfathers,' 'to the great-grandfathers.'

2\. In the same way he sacrifices of the food, altering the Mantra,
'Carry the food, &c.'

3\. Then he sacrifices the Svish*t*ak*ri*t oblation

with (the formula), 'To Agni Kavyavâhana Svish*t*ak*ri*t svadhâ!
Adoration!'

4\. He then touches the food with (the formulas), 'The earth is thy
vessel, the heaven is the lid. I sacrifice thee into the Brahman's
mouth. I sacrifice thee into the up-breathing and down-breathing of the
Brâhma*n*as. Thou art imperishable; do not perish for the Fathers
yonder, in yon world! The earth is steady; Agni is its surveyor in order
that what has been given may not be lost.

'The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &c. Do not perish for
the grandfathers yonder, in yon world. The air is steady; Vâyu is its
surveyor, in order that what has been given may not be lost.

'The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is the lid, &c. Do not perish for
the great-grandfathers yonder, in yon world. The heaven is steady;
Âditya is its surveyor, in order that what has been given may not be
lost.'

5. <span id="fr_680"></span>[5](#fn_680) With (the words.md), 'I establish
myself in the breath and sacrifice ambrosia,' he causes the Brâhma*n*as
to touch (the food).

<span id="fn_679"></span>[227:1](sbe30083.htm#fr_679.md) 11, 1. *Ri*g-veda
X, 15, 53; Atharva-veda XVIII, 4, 64; Â*s*valâyana-G*ri*hya II, 4, 13,
&c. Before the verse, 'Carry the Â*g*ya,' the Udî*k*yas, as Mât*ri*datta
states, insert the words, 'He then makes oblations of Â*g*ya (with the
Mantra, &c.).' According to this reading the words of the second Sûtra,
'In the same way, &c.,' would refer only to these last oblations.
