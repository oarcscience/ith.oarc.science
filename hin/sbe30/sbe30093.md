### INTRODUCTORY NOTE

###### TO THE

## G*RI*HYA-SÛTRA OF ÂPASTAMBA.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> short treatise of Âpastamba on the
G*ri*hya ritual forms one Pra*s*na of the great corpus of the
Âpastambîya-Kalpa-sûtra (see Sacred Books, vol. ii, p. xii) and stands,
among the G*ri*hya texts, in closest connection with the
Hira*n*yake*s*i-G*ri*hya-sûtra. The chief difference between these two
Sûtras, both belonging to the Taittirîya School of the Black
Ya*g*ur-veda, consists herein, that Âpastamba, just as has been stated
above <span id="fr_711"></span>[1](#fn_711) with regard to Gobhila,
gives only the rules for the performance of the G*ri*hya rites without
the Mantras, which are contained in a special collection, the
Mantrapâ*th*a, standing by the side of the Sûtras: Hira*n*yake*s*in, on
the other hand, follows the more usual practice, as adopted by
*S*âṅkhâyana, Â*s*valâyana, Pâraskara, of interweaving the description
of the ceremonies with the text of the corresponding Mantras. As to the
relation in which the Âpastambîya-sûtras stand to the Mantrapâ*th*a,
there is, so far as I can see, no reason why we should not extend the
theory which we have tried to establish with regard to Gobhila, to the
evidently parallel case of Âpastamba: the Sûtras presuppose the
existence of the Mantrapâ*th*a, just as the latter text seems to
presuppose the Sûtras.—The questions regarding the historical relation
of Âpastamba to Hira*n*yake*s*in have been treated of by Professor
Bühler in his Introduction to Âpastamba's Dharma-sûtra, S.B.E., vol. ii,
pp. xxiii seq.

I have here to thank Dr. Winternitz, to whom we are indebted for an
excellent edition of the Âpastambîya-G*ri*hya-sûtra, for having placed
at my disposal, before publication,

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

the proof-sheets of his edition, and for lending me his copy of the
Mantrapâ*th*a as well as of the commentary of Haradatta. The kindness of
the same scholar has enabled me to make use of Professor Eggeling's copy
of the first part of Sudar*s*anârya's commentary and of his own copy of
the second part of the same work.
