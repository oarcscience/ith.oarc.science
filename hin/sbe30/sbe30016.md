### KÂ*ND*IKÂ 4. <span id="fr_212"></span>[4](#fn_212.md)

1\. When she mounts the chariot, let him murmur the verse, 'Adorned with
Ki*ms*uka flowers, of *S*almali wood' (MB. I, 3, 11).

2. <span id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_213.md) On the way he should address
crossways, rivers and unevennesses (of the soil), big trees, and burial
grounds, with (the verse), 'May no waylayers meet us' (ibid. 12).

3. <span id="fr_214"></span>[3](#fn_214.md) If the axle breaks, or
something that is bound gets loose, or if the chariot is overturned, or
if some other accident happens, they should put wood on the fire which
they carry with themselves, should

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

make oblations (of Â*g*ya) with the Vyâh*ri*tis, should procure a new
piece (instead of that which has been damaged), and should besmear it
with the remnants of the Â*g*ya (that has been offered), with (the
verse), 'He who without binding' (Sâma-veda I, 244).

4\. Having sung the Vâmadevya, he should mount (again).

5\. When they have arrived, the Vâmadevya (is sung).

6\. When (the bride) has reached the house, Brâhma*n*a women of good
character, whose husbands and sons are living, make her descend (from
the chariot), and make her sit down on a bull's hide with (the verse
which the husband recites), 'Here, ye cows, bring forth calves' (MB. I,
3, 13).

7\. They should place a boy in her lap.

8. <span id="fr_215"></span>[8](#fn_215.md) Into the joined hands of that
(boy) they should throw lotus-roots (?),

9\. Or fruits.

10. <span id="fr_216"></span>[10](#fn_216.md) After she has made that boy
rise, she sacrifices the eight 'firm' Â*g*ya oblations with (the
formula), 'Here is steadiness' (MB. I, 3, 14).

11\. When she has finished, she puts a piece of wood (on the fire) and
respectfully salutes the Gurus, according to seniority, with their Gotra
names. Then they may do what they like.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_212"></span>[49:4](sbe30016.htm#fr_212.md) The way of the
bridegroom with the bride to their new home, and their arrival.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[49:2](sbe30016.htm#fr_213.md) Perhaps a part of
this Sûtra is based on a half Sloka, the two parts of which have been
transposed in the prose version, mahâv*ri*kshân *s*ma*s*âna*m* *k*a
nadî*s* *k*a vishamâ*n*i *k*a.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[49:3](sbe30016.htm#fr_214.md) Comp. Pâraskara I,
10.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[50:8](sbe30016.htm#fr_215.md) The explanation of
*s*akalo*t*a as *s*âlûka is doubtful. Prof. Weber believes that we ought
to read *s*akalosh*t*ân (lumps of dung); see Indische Studien, V, 371.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[50:10](sbe30016.htm#fr_216.md) 'Firm' oblations
seem to mean oblations by which the wife obtains a firm abode in her
husband's house. Comp. Indische Studien, V, 376.
