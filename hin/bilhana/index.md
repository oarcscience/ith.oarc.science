This is a versified translation of the Caurapañcāśikā. This love poem of
fifty stanzas was written by the Kasmiri poet Bilhana Kavi in the 11th
century. The story runs that the Brahman Bilhana had a clandestine love
affair with Princess Yaminipurnatilaka, the daughter of King
Madanabhirama. He was discovered and Bilhana wrote this poem in prison
before he learned whether he would be executed or banished. The historic
outcome is unknown, which adds to the readers' suspense.

Initially this poem was transmitted orally, and by the time it was
written down, there several variations: the South Indian versions tend
to have a happy ending, and the Northern, Kashmiri, recension has an
open ending.

The Caurapañcāśikā was 'discovered' by Europeans in the nineteenth
century. The first French edition, published in The Journal Asiatique of
1848, was based on one of the South Indian versions with a happy ending.
There were several 19th century translations in various languages; it
was suitable material for Romantic poets, including Sir Edwin Arnold,
who produced his own (very loose) translation. In 1919, the English poet
Powys Mathers produced this free-verse translation, titled Black
Marigolds. This was the translation which John Steinbeck quotes in
Cannery Row. A modern version worth looking for is The Secret Delights
of Love, by Gertrude Clorius Schwebell, Peter Pauper Press, New York
\[1966\]; this can be found

very inexpensively.
