### INTRODUCTION

We have two Yoga Vashishts, one going under the name great, the other
small. This is the small book; both hooks are the work of the Rishi
Vashisht, and it is the book for those who are seeking truth but not for
the ignorant. It is the best book on wisdom and gives seven states of
wisdom by understanding the liberation easily to be attained, and it
also gives us the seven states of ignorance. It gives spiritual food for
those who hunger. "No one can miss the God consciousness within," Swami
Ram Tritha once said. It is true and I agree with the Swami. It is the
best work for self realization. In it, one will find the answer to, who
created this universe; the cause of and how to cure diseases. It reveals
the mastery of the Kundalini, the Mother of the Universe, and her power;
how to perform levitation, and the secret of the long lived Yogi. How to
master mind, and control matter

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

and all the miseries of the world. In the story of Bali, it gives us
encouragement and faith, that even a great egoist can attain
liberation,—the goal of the Yogi or the truth seeker.

More than a year ago, I was at Los Angeles and for the first time, heard
that the truth seekers were searching for this book.

Many asked if I would get some copies of it, for them. I wrote to India
and also tried here, but was unable to find a copy. I then advertised in
Europe but could not find it there.

A student of mine, in Los Angeles, brought a copy to my class but the
owner refused to part with it, even when offered thirty dollars. I then
decided to translate this work for the truth-seeker.

The reader will find this work contains the records of spiritual truths,
the secret doctrine or eternal teaching of the Munis and Rishis, of
India.

The ideals are wonderfully clear. They always begin on the gross and
gradually take the student to a higher and finer stage of self
realization. They do that because the thought, at first,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

is undeveloped, but step by step becomes finer and finer.

The Hindus in their attempt to find a solution to the problems of life
and death in the external world, failed, as the nations of the West do
to-day. They found that the senses could not help them in the problems
of life, therefore, they gave up the external world and turned their
attentions upon the internal. They gave all their time to the study of
the Atma, which gave them finally, the solution of the problems of life
and death. Their teachings give us a glimpse of the Atma that is the
Absolute. They found that the individual soul is no other than the
Brahma, Himself.

Those readers who will follow closely the teachings of this work and
concentrate upon them will surely reach the goal "where the sun cannot
shine, nor the moon nor the stars—the lightning cannot illumine, how can
they? For when the Self shines, all shine."

I have put here the way my Master taught me about this work, for the
benefit of the truth-seeker.

It is the guidance for the daily life. The work of the Great Master, who
has it made so very easy, by illustrations.

The list of books is long; mishaps arise  
To bar the student's progress; Life is brief;  
Whatever, then, in books is best and chief.  
The essence, kernel—that attracts the wise.  
J. Muir—Metrical Translation.
