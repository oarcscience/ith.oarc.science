### THE GREAT EGOIST—BALI

The Master Vashisht continued:

"The illumination of wisdom came like the dawn to the heart of Pavana,
who had been initiated by his brother, the Muni Punya. Both of these
brothers having attained Atmic wisdom, lived in the forest. For many
years they enjoyed the quiet pleasures of solitude and at last reached
the calm of bodiless bliss <span id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3.md)—like
lights which have consumed both wick and oil. For this is the fate of
all beings.

"If one, in his many incarnations is related to all, where then, is the
necessity of love or hate? The most reasonable course is to forego
extreme and excessive desires, not to enlarge upon them. If desire is
allowed to flourish lit becomes food for contemplation. When desire
passes, so does the structure of thought built about it, collapse and
perish. This is indeed. truth.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

"O Ram, mount the great edifice of renunciation and behold in spiritual
vision this insignificant universe palpitating with unruly desires—then
you will indeed know that you lack nothing. This exalted state contains
the truth of Brahma without. impurity, delusion or the plague of
ignorance. If this state be attained by faith even though the
intelligence is meager, its devotees will not be subject to delusion.
Therefore, O Ram, lead thus your life.

"With the progressive development of intelligence and the exercise of a
fine discrimination all pain will cease. Even though one may find a
close ally in a Guru, <span id="fr_4"></span>[\*\*](#fn_4.md) it is only
through individual energy and will, that all pains arising from
association with kinsmen and heterogeneity can be destroyed. Having
labored diligently through Atmic enquiry, books of wisdom, and noble
benevolence, your mind is forced to follow the Atmic life—then pain will
cease. The collective wealth of all worlds will not compare with the
happiness arising from the blissful mind which has found emancipation.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

"Like a sandal protects the foot, however stony the path, so also, does
the mind fill the whole of creation with purest joy. A mind filled to
the fullest with neutrality of vision will never entertain mundane
desire; nor a mind confused by conflicting desires ever have its
grievances completely redressed. A mind free from desire yields pure
thoughts, as readily as Muni Agastya sipped the waters of the ocean in
the space of a moment; the radiance of the full moon has not such
refulgence, nor does Lakshmi <span id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md) reposing
on fragrant Lotus grant such a boon.

"The ghosts of desire will dim the lustre of the stainless mind just as
clouds hide the moon, or black stains deface polished stone. Liberation
means only the destruction of the impurities of the mind and this mind
is developed only when desire and fears of rebirth are destroyed. If
this is not possible, O Ram, thou shalt arrive at wisdom by the path
followed by the great Bali. Such a course is beneficial."

Thereupon Ram asked him to relate the story of Bali.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

Rishi Vashisht replied: "There once lived a great king who was also a
great egoist. He reigned over Patala <span
id="fr_6"></span>[\*\*](#fn_6.md) as an emperor. The whole world trembled
beneath his autocratic rule; even the gods were overpowered and humbled
before him. He was the son of the noble Virochana, and reigned mightily
for ten million years.

"One day he mounted to the parapet atop his palace—his palace which was
studded with gems brought from the Manhameru <span
id="fr_7"></span>[\*\*\*](#fn_7.md) Heights. There in solitude he spoke the
travail of his mind. He was satiated with the material pleasure of his
world and his speech was replete with bitterness.

"'Of what avail is this undisputed sovereignty which has enable me to
enjoy the wealth of these three worlds, when I reflect that the
pleasures of wealth are but fleeting, and that I repeat to-day's actions
again tomorrow with only a gain of momentary [happiness](errata.htm#11.md)?
Enjoyed incidents do recur again; ornaments worn proudly yesterday are
put on again to-day. We observe that even

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

the intelligent do not become appeased by these recurrences and are not
ashamed to enjoy them again, like children who feast repeatedly on
sweets.

"'Thy cycle of days, months, years and yugas roll on, and the old is
ever old, though decked in the changing garments of the mode.

"'Has the faithful performance of my duties improved my life in the
slightest degree? What will bring me possession of THAT and free me of
action and its results? Where is the path which will lead me to THAT
which is peace, free from illusion?'

"Deep in reflection he sought the Principle which is eternal and at last
was rewarded by the solution. With eyes flashing with joy he burst into
speech.

"'It was in this very place that I enquired about this Principle from my
omniscient father, Virochana. He explained then the manner in which I
might remove my doubts when I asked (him, what is that incomparable
state in which the illusions of pain and pleasure are lost, wherein the
mind's delusions find oblivion, and where desires are uprooted?' I
begged that he would

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

describe to me the attainment of that goal which knows not the
'restraint of desires and the gloomy despondences of the mind.

"'Tell me, O Father, I beseech thee what is the state which is wholly
permeated with Absolute bliss? O thou Knower of the Supreme, enlighten
me and release me from the torment of doubts which arise!'

"And thus Virochana replied:

"'Harken to my words. There is a beautiful country which is illimitable
and all pervading. In it the worlds arise and into it the worlds are
absorbed. In this country there are not the five grand elements, nor are
there hills, forest, temples, Devas or even the ancient souls.
Illumination is the name of the King who exists there, alone. He is
omnipotent, omniscient, the cause of all, perfectly quiescent and
refulgent. He is Silence itself. He will unfailingly cause all acts to
be performed by a minister appointed by him. The instant that a thought
arises in the minister, the idea, though previously non-existent,
immediately crystallizes into actuality and as mysteriously disappears.
The minister enjoys nothing by his own right nor does he know anything.
Acting always in concert

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

with the King he is able to do all things. Though the minister stands
always in the presence of the King, the King remains invisible and
solitary.'

"So saith the father to his son.

"The son had listened appreciatively to the words of his father. Now he
questioned.

"'What is the character of this enlightened country which is without
disease and misery,. which though apart, yet pervades all? How can it be
reached? By what means can it be attained? Who is the immortal King of
that strange country? Who is his minister? Who is the mighty King, who,
as if in sport, will make me ruler of this universe?'

"His father answered. 'Who is able to over-step the rigorous law of the
powerful minister? Even though the hosts of the world beleaguer him,
they can never overpower him. Though spears be hurled against him they
will be as futile as flowers flung at a stone wall. Only the King can
command obeisance from his minister, for it were easier to move the
great Himalayas than to bring Him into subjection. It takes a very
superior intelligence

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

to subdue the minister, for he is like an angry serpent who when trod
upon will hiss and strike.

"'All this, my son, is symbolic. The country in my story is liberation,
incomparable and eternal; the King is Atmic Reality, inseparable from
'liberation and refulgent with eternal light; the -minister of the King
typifies the mind or intelligence. The symbol and realization of supreme
authority is the subjection, control and eradication of sensual
pleasures and the building-up of an indifference to them. When the mind
has overcome desire, then it resembles a mischievous elephant safely
caged.

"'Those unacquainted with the true books of wisdom maintain that of the
four parts into which they divide time, one-half should be devoted to a
study of sensual objects, one-quarter to study of the Books of Wisdom,
and the remaining quarter to the worship of a blessed Guru (spiritual
teacher); that if this be done, wisdom will replace ignorance.

"'The partially knowing assert that of the four divisions one should
devote half the time to contemplation and worship of a Guru, a quarter
to meditation upon the spiritual truths

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

contained in the Books of Wisdom, and the remaining quarter to the study
of the actions of the sensual organs. The wisdom will prevail in him,
and he will know the supreme truth.

"'The third class, who are of the wise elect;. affirm that liberation
will be attained by those, who, dividing the concentration of the mind
into four parts devote them to the four purposes of a study of the Books
of Wisdom, which outline the pursuit of the path of Atmic Reality.
Self-knowledge, desirelessness, worship, and worship of a Guru.

"May you, my son, through diligent enquiry and intelligent effort,
understand Atmic worship and the subjugation of desire simultaneously.
By a determined master of your desires, Atmic enquiry naturally follows,
and in turn Atmic enquiry induces a relinquishment of desire. They are
mutually dependent one upon the other, like' the clouds which fill the
ocean.

"'Having earned, in proper ways, wealth for. relieving one's kindred and
dependents. one should, by the help of that wealth, promote the
qualities of truthful conduct and gradually assume indifference to the
world of objects and

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

futile pleasures. This is the state those reach who live in Jnana
(wisdom). This is the glory of peace.'

"Soliloquizing thus, he asked himself, 'Who am I and what is my real
nature?' After a moment's reflection he concluded that if he invoked his
Guru, who had attained Realization, and should enquire of him the truth,
then ignorance would forsake him. Therefore, with closed eyes he
meditated affectionately upon his Guru. Thereupon his Guru took form
before him, a form constituted of the blessed air. With an enraptured
heart the King saluted him and spread fragrant flowers before the
resplendent Guru.

"Beloved Guru, deign to hear my words and bless me accordingly. What is
the NOW? What is there BEYOND? What is THAT which is limited? Who am I
who speaks? And YOU who hear? What is this material universe? Favor me,
Divinity, with answers to quiet all my doubts.'

"'The Guru pondered for a moment and then replied: 'I am on my way to
Heaven where dwell the immortals. Why should I take unnecessary time or
waste words? Briefly, I tell you this, all the manifestations before us
here are wrought

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

of wisdom, the unmanifested is also wisdom; I, who speak, am wisdom, and
pure wisdom are you, who hear. The entire universe is naught but
all-full wisdom. Take these conclusions, impress them upon your mind and
meditate upon the Reality of Wisdom. If you can accept Reality, you will
attain the Supreme state. The Sapta-Rishi <span
id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md) has just now entered a new state;
therefore, I shall pass.' So saying the Guru of Bali retired.

"Contemplating the truth of his Guru's words, he became convinced that
ALL IS WISDOM. This earth is none other than the manifestation of
Wisdom; the three worlds are Jnana; my real nature is Jnana. The fates
are Jnana. I have become the shining Brahmic One, who scintillates
undimmed by the visual or the sensual. I have become the One principle,
which unbound by objectives, pervades all at one and the same
time—intelligence itself.

"Mentally vibrating to Om, which is the true significator of Absolute
Wisdom, Bali entered a

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

trance-like state, which was free from thought, desire or doubts, and
there he remained statue-like in Samadhi for a long period.

"Thus did the Emperor Bali remain motionless, as the flame of a lighted
lamp in a sheltered, windless place. And since he was illumined by the
Truth, unstained by love or hate, his mind merged into Divine Peace.
Such a condition can best be compared to clear, autumnal sky.

"Seeking their Emperor, his courtiers found him deep in Samadhi.

"After a long time, Bali awoke and went about his regal duties, his mind
free from desire and egotism. His pure mind was never again flurried in
adversity or prosperity, neither did he lose himself in either pleasure
or pain. Thus his equable gaze viewed all impartially, however numerous
were the hosts of good and had thoughts that arose in his mind. As the
procession of countless objects passed before him, the controlled them
all.

"So shall you, O Ram, pillion your mind, roving amid the pleasures of
this and higher worlds, in the centre of your heart. Wherever your mind
stumbles like an awkward child and falls into

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

sensuality, you must lift it to the indivisible Jnana and there let your
mind become one with wisdom. By daily and consistent practice you may
chain the terrible elephant of mind, so that
[untrammeled](errata.htm#12.md) by pain, you will enable it to reach
liberation through control."

So saith the great Master, Rishi Vashisht.
