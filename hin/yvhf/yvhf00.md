If all great men were good and all good men would write a book, this
world would be made better by their activities.

Rishi Gherwal's books are observation of nature and nature is God's
"Master-piece". They are historical records of true facts of the Hindu
books on philosophy, and are like a visit to that old ancient Temple of
Mathra.

His manner of teaching and writing inspires us with the knowledge of
ourselves, to be the same as the Universal Brotherhood—, Self of the
Universe, with God's poise and sense of mastery.

His books give us the blessed assurance that

we no longer need to travel to get wisdom. Study TRUTH and absorb its
teachings, and the world will come to you, as it has to him.

May Peace be Unto him, together with a benediction of love, with our
blessings.

Dr. and Mrs. J. D. Ward.
