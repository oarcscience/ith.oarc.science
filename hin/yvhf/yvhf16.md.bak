#### KUNDALINI

#### THE MOTHER OF THE UNIVERSE

India is the mysterious land. The things of which we have read in old
histories and all the bibles, of their marvelous feats are still
happening today.

Yogis are performing such feats as, walking on red hot coals of fire;
being buried alive for months and others quite as extraordinary,
however, far too many to enumerate.

These are all accredited to the Power of Kundalini, and in the pages of
this book, you will find the answer as to how this wonderful power is
created.
