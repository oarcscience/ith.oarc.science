### LECTURE VI

### POPULAR DEVOTIONAL MYSTICISM

THE chief features of the passionate devotion for God described in the
last lecture are its spontaneity and its transference of human relations
and emotions to God through the medium of the Krishna legend described
in the Bhagavata Purana. It presupposes the theory of the incarnation of
God as man, which makes it possible to think of God in human relations
and in human ways. The idea of God as father is indeed as old as the
Vedas. It is expressed also in several passages of the Gita (9.17,
11.43, 11.44, 14.4) and in the Puranas, in the Nyaya-bhashya of
Vatsyayana, as well as elsewhere. Nevertheless it did not, during this
period, seem to gain much strength in the way of fostering an intimate
relation with God or of affecting worship. Wherever it appears it seems
to be but one of the many passing phases in which God's relation to man
is viewed when God is praised and extolled in His greatness as Lord and
Master. But in the new school of bhakti the conception of God as
creator, supporter, father, lord and master, or as the ultimate
philosophical principle, is subordinated to the conception of god as the
nearest and dearest. The most important feature is His nearness to and
His intimacy with us--not His great powers, which create

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

a distance between Him and us. That He is the greatest of the great and
the Highest of the high, that there is nothing greater and higher than
Him is admitted by all. His greatness, however, does not reveal the
secret of why He should be so dear to us. He may be the greatest,
highest, loftiest and the most transcendent, but yet He has made His
home in our hearts and has come down to our level to give us His
affection and love. Indeed He is conceived as so near to us that we can
look upon Him and love Him with the love of a very dear friend, or with
the devotion and the intensity of love of a spouse. Love is a great
leveller; the best way of realizing God is by making Him an equal
partner in life by the force of intense love. <span
class="margnote"><span id="6-1">1</span></span>

The legend of Krishna supplies a human touch to God's dealings with men.
With the help of this legend the bhaktas of the new school, by a
peculiar mystical turn of mind, could conceive of God as at once a great
being with transcendent powers and also as an intimate friend or a dear
lover maintaining human relations with his bhaktas. The episodes of
Krishna's life in Brindaban are spiritualized. They are often conceived
to happen on a non-physical plane where both Krishna and his partners
are thought to play their parts of love and friendship in non-physical
bodies. Thus they are not regarded as particular events that took place
at specific points of time in the life of a particular man, Krishna.
They are interpreted as the eternal, timeless and spaceless play of God
with His own associates and His energies, with whom He eternally
realizes Himself in love and friendship. The

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

part that his bhaktas had to play was to identify themselves, by a great
stretch of sympathy, as partners in or spectators of God's love-play,
and find their fullest satisfaction in the satisfaction of God. For a
true bhakta, it is not necessary, therefore, that his sense-inclinations
should be destroyed. What is necessary is merely that these should be
turned towards God and not towards himself, i.e., that he use his senses
not for his own worldly satisfaction but to find enjoyment and
satisfaction in the great love-drama of God by identifying himself with
one of the spiritual partners of God in his love-play. Hence it is not
essential that all desires and sense-functions, as the Gita says, be
destroyed, or that the individual behave as if he had desires while yet
being absolutely desireless. It was required that the bhakta have the
fullest satisfaction of his sense and inclinations by participating in
the joys of Krishna in his divine love-play. For such participation and
vicarious enjoyment was regarded as true love (*preman*), while the
satisfaction of one's own senses or of one's own worldly purposes was
viewed as a vicious passion. Thus here we have a new scheme of life. The
ideal of desirelessness and absolute self-control is replaced by that of
participation in a drama of divine joy, and the desires are given full
play in the direction of God. Desires are not to be distinguished; only
their directions are to be changed. <span class="margnote"><span
id="6-2">2</span></span>

Though this form of bhakti has in various circles at times been debased
and encroached upon by diverse kinds of eroticism or erotic mysticism,
it cannot be

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

denied that many of the immediate and later followers of Chaitanya
achieved great spiritual success in this form of bhakti-worship. In the
Narayaniya chapter of the fifth canto of the Mahabharata God is spoken
of as a father, mother and teacher; and in the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali
and elsewhere the idea is often expressed that God originally taught the
Vedas to the sages and that He is therefore the original teacher. In all
these writings, however, the love of God supercedes deep reverence. The
true bhakta looked upon God as the divine dispenser; he considered all
that he had--kingdoms, riches, wife and all that he could call his
own--to be God's. Love of God as the mother of the world plays an
important part in the religious attitude of many bhakti worshippers.
This is particularly true in the case of Ramprasad and others, notably
the sage Ramakrishna of recent times. And in this attribution of
motherliness to God both Ramprasad and Ramakrishna view Him as a tender
mother who is always helping her child, condoning his sins and
transgressions, partial to his weaknesses and concerned to better him.
Nevertheless He cannot be attained by mere formal worship but only
through a whole-hearted worship, with a proper control of the
sense-inclinations. <span class="margnote"><span
id="6-3">3</span></span>

The theory of bhakti seems to have its original source in the Pancaratra
school of Vaishnavism. However, the doctrine of supreme self-surrender
to Narayana, Hari or Krishna as the one and only God in disregard of all
other mythical gods, represents a teaching of the Gita, the chief work
of the Ekanti

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

school of Vaishnavas; and this doctrine forms the universal basis of all
kinds of bhakti worship, though among the Shaktas or Shaivas the supreme
deity went by the name of Shakti or Shiva. The Gita plainly teaches, as
we have already pointed out in our previous lecture, that there is no
other God but Narayana or Krishna, that He alone is great and that we
should lay aside all other modes of religious worship and take refuge in
Him. In Chaitanya this devotion to God developed into a life-absorbing
passion; yet in all advanced forms of bhakti the chief emphasis is on
supreme attachment to God. The sort of bhakti which Prahlada asked as a
boon from Hari was such an attachment for Him as worldly persons have
for the objects of their senses. Such a bhakti, as described in the
Bhagavata or the Shandilya sutra, is not worship out of a sense of duty
or mere meditation on God or mere singing of His name, but it is deep
affection (*anurakti*). It is therefore neither knowledge nor any kind
of activity, but is a feeling. And the taking of refuge (*prapatti*) in
God is also not motivated by knowledge but by a deep affection which
impels the individual to take his first and last stay in Him. But though
a feeling, this bhakti does not bind anyone to the world. For the world
is but a manifestation of God's maya, and God so arranges for those who
love Him that His maya cannot bind His bhakta to the world. <span
class="margnote"><span id="6-4">4</span></span>

But how is such a bhakti possible? For this also we have ultimately to
depend on God. There is a passage in the Upanishads (Katha II. 23) which
states

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

that He can be attained by him whom He (God) chooses. This text has
often been cited to indicate that it is only the chosen man of God who
has the privilege of possessing a special affection for God. Vallabha
declares this special favor (*pushti*) of God indispensable for the rise
of such an affection for God. He further holds that according to the
different degrees of the favor of God one may have different degrees of
affection for Him, though by avoiding the commission of sinful actions,
by cleansing the mind of the impurities of worldly passions, and by
inclining the mind towards God, one may go a great way in deserving His
special favor. It is only by the highest special favor of God that one's
affection or attachment for Him can become an all-consuming and
all-engulfing passion (*vyasana*--see the Prameyaratnarnava). True
devotion to God, affection or love for Him, must always be an end in
itself and never a means to any other end, not even salvation or
liberation, so much praised in the classical systems of philosophy. This
all-absorbing passion for God is the bhakta's eternal stay in God, and
dearer to him than liberation or any other goal of religious
realization. <span class="margnote"><span id="6-5">5</span></span>

It is not out of place here to mention that among various Hindu sects it
was held that an engrossing passion of any kind may so possess the whole
mind that all other mental functions may temporarily be suspended, and
that gradually, through the repeated occurrence of such a passion, the
other mental functions may be altogether annihilated. Thus, absorption
in a single supreme passion may make the mind

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

so one-pointed that all other attachments are transcended and the
individual attains Brahmahood (see the Spandapradipika). In the
Upanishads (Brihadaranyaka IV. 3.21) we find that the bliss of Brahman
is compared with the loving embrace of a beloved woman. To love one's
husband and to serve him as a god was regarded from very early times as
the only spiritualizing duty for a woman. Hence the idea that ordinary
man-and-woman love may be so perfected as to become a spiritual force
easily won acceptance in certain circles. This man-and-woman love
developed an absorbing and dominant passion, completely independent and
unaided by other considerations of marital and parental duties. In its
non-marital forms, it was considered to be capable of becoming so deep
as to become by itself a spiritualizing force. Moreover, it was thought
that the transition from human love to divine love was so easy that a
man who had specialized in the experience of deep man-and-woman love of
a non-marital type could easily change the direction of his love from
woman to God, and thus indulge in a passionate love for God. The story
is told that in his early career the saint Bilvamangala became so deeply
attached to a courtesan named Cintamani that one night he swam across a
river supported by a floating corpse, then scaled a high wall by holding
on to the tail of a serpent, and finally well-nigh broke his limbs in
jumping down from the wall into the yard of Cintamani. The woman,
however, rebuked him, saying that if he entertained toward God a little
of the love that he had for her he would be a saint. This produced

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

such a wonderful change in Bilvamangala that he forthwith became a
God-intoxicated man. Later, in his saintly life, when he once again felt
attracted by a woman, he plucked out his eyes so that external forms and
colors might not further tempt him. This blind saint became one of the
best-reputed among all the saints, devoting his life to the love of God.
<span class="margnote"><span id="6-6">6</span></span>

Thus there grew up a school of mystics, including the great poet
Candidas and others, who devoted themselves to the cultivation of the
spirituality of love and the deification of human love, and who thought
that more could be learned through such efforts than through any other
mode of worship. "There is no god or goddess in Heaven who can teach
spiritual truths more than the person whom one loves with the whole
heart." The goddess Basuli whom Candidas worshipped is said to have
admonished him to adhere to his love for the washerwoman Rami, saying
that Rami would be able to teach him truths that no one else could, and
to lead him to such bliss as not even the creator himself might do. A
somewhat similar idea of the purificatory power of intense human love is
found in the Vishnupurana. In describing the illicit love of a
cowherd-girl for Krishna, the Vishnupurana says that at her separation
from him she underwent so much suffering that all her sins were
expiated, and that in thinking of him in her separation from him she had
so much delight as would be equal to the collective culmination of all
the happiness that she could enjoy as a reward of her virtuous actions.
By the combination of the suffering and the bliss, she exhausted

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

all the fruits of her bad and good deeds, and thus by her thoughts of
Krishna she attained her liberation. Somewhat allied with the idea of
human worship, though not of the man-and-women type just mentioned, is a
certain attitude sometimes adopted toward man as a religious teacher.
The latter was considered in many circles as the representative of God
on earth, and self-surrender, love and devotion to him was considered to
lead one to God. This sort of worship was prevalent among the Hindus and
the Buddhists from pretty early times. One fact should be noted. It was
associated with reverence and a sense of the religious teacher's
superiority, whereas the other type of worship (through romantic love)
raised the man and woman by their constancy and sufferings for each
other and the happiness that each enjoys in the company and thought of
the other. In this latter case, love is religion, and all pain endured
for the beloved, joy. With the exception of the phase of love-mysticism
just mentioned, I have thus far confined myself to a description of
different forms of mysticism as portrayed in Sanskrit writings. I shall
now turn to the mysticism of divine love that found expression in the
vernaculars of North India and of the South. But this is a vast subject
and I can say only a few words. <span class="margnote"><span
id="6-7">7</span></span>

Let me advert first to the Alvar saints of the South, the earliest of
whom belonged to the second and the latest to the tenth century, A. D.
They all wrote psalms or songs in Tamil, a Dravidian tongue of South
India. They were inspired by the teachings of Vaishnavism when it
travelled from the North to the South.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Their doctrines
were more or less similar to those touched upon in the preceding lecture
in connection with the bhakti mysticism of the Bhagavata Purana and the
Gita. They are embodied in psalms and not in any connected philosophical
treatise. Describing his insatiable love of God, Nam Alvar says:

"As I dote on the Lord of Katkarai (God)  
Whose streets with scarlet lily are perfumed  
My heart for his wonderful graces melts  
How then can I, my restless love suppress?" <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> With reference to
Nam Alvar, Govindacarya has said: "Briefly, Saint Nam Alvar declares
that when one is overcome by bhakti exaltation, trembling in every cell
of his being, he must freely and passively allow this influence to
penetrate his being, and carry him beyond all known states of
consciousness; never from fear or shame that bystanders may take him for
a madman, ought the exhibition of this bhakti-rapture that deluges his
being, to be suppressed. The very madness is the means of distinguishing
him from the ordinary mortals to whom such beatific vision is
necessarily denied. The very madness is the bhakta's pride. In that very
madness, the saint exhorts, "run, jump, cry, laugh and sing, and let
every man witness it." <span class="margnote"><span
id="6-8">8</span></span>

Let us now pass on to other saints of the South, Namdev and Tukaram. The
bhakti school referred to in the last lecture, and most of the other
branches of this school, developed under purely Brahminic traditions and
in the shadow of Brahminic scriptures,

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

the Puranas and the like. And though in the Bhagavata we find that even
the foreign and aboriginal races of the Kiratas, Hunas, Andhras,
Pulindas, Pukkasas, Abhiras, Suhmas, Yavanas, Khasas, etc., become pure
if they are attached to God, yet the Brahminic civilization had such a
hold over the country that the cult of bhakti grew up around the
traditional cult of Rama, or Krishna, Shiva or Shakti. Representation of
God in images and their worship by the bhaktas, faith in the legends of
Krishna and other inferior deities as told in the Puranas, preferential
treatment of the Brahmin caste, respect to the Vedas, etc., became very
intimately associated with the doctrine of bhakti preached in the
Puranas and other Sanskrit scriptures. We know, of course, that the
bhakti cult spread also among foreigners. Thus, in the second century B.
C., the Greek king Heliodorus, son of Dios, dedicated to Vasudeva a
flagstaff bearing an image of the bird Garuda, on which the God Vasudeva
or Krishna was said to ride. Now, though the sons of some demons are
also known to have been great bhaktas, as described in the Puranas, yet
the latter all accepted the traditional God Vasudeva and they regarded
the legends associated with Krishna or Vasudeva as real episodes of his
life. In the thirteenth century A. D., we find that Visoba Khecar, the
teacher of the bhakta Namdev, denounced the worship of images as a
substitute for the God Krishna or for any other god. He is said to have
instructed Namdev to abandon image-worship, saying: "A stone god never
speaks. What possibility then of his removing the disease of mundane

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

existence? A stone image is regarded as God, but the true God is wholly
different. If a stone god fulfills desires, how is it he breaks when
struck? Those who adore a god made of stone, lose everything through
their folly. Those who say and hear that a god of stone speaks to his
devotees are both of them fools. Whether a holy place is small or large
there is no god but stone or water. There is no place which is devoid of
God. That God has shown Nama in his heart and thus Khecar conferred a
blessing on him." <span id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) Namdev was a tailor
by caste and he worshipped the idol at Pandharpur in the Maratha country
in South India. However, he had a full knowledge of the true nature of
God, as had other bhaktas of Sanskritic traditions. Thus he says: "The
Veda has to speak by Thy might and the Sun has to move round; such is
the might of Thee, the Lord of the Universe. Knowing this essential
truth I have surrendered myself to Thee. By Thy might it is that the
clouds have to pour down rain, mountains to rest firm and the wind to
blow." <span id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8.md) Again: "Vows, fasts and
austerities are not at all necessary; nor is it necessary for you to go
on a pilgrimage. Be you watchful in your hearts and always sing the name
of Hari. It is not necessary to give up eating food or drinking water;
fix your mind on the foot of Hari. Neither is it necessary for you to
contemplate the one without attributes. Hold fast to the love of the
name of Hari." "Recognize him alone to be a righteous man, who sees
Vasudeva in all objects,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

eradicating all pride or egoism. The rest are entangled in the shackles
of delusion. To him all wealth is like earth, and the nine gems are mere
stones. The two, desire and anger, he has thrown out, and he cherishes
in his heart quietude and forgiveness." <span
id="fr_9"></span>[4](#fn_9.md) Again he says: "Firmly grasp the truth which
is Narayana. Purity of conduct should not be abandoned; one should not
be afraid of the censure of people and thus accomplish one's own
purpose. Surrender yourself to your loving friend (God) giving up all
ostentation and pride. The censure of people should be regarded as
praise and their praise not heeded. One should entertain no longing for
being respected and honored, but should nourish in oneself a liking for
devotion. This should be rendered firm in the mind and the name of God
should not be neglected even for a moment." <span
id="fr_10"></span>[5](#fn_10.md) <span class="margnote"><span
id="6-9">9</span></span>

The essence of the teachings of Namdev, as of almost all the other
bhaktas of whom I shall now be speaking, is purity of mind, speech, and
deed, utter disregard of castes, creeds and other social distinctions, a
tendency to leave all for God, and in love and joy to live in God
always, utterly ignoring all social, communal and religious prejudices,
narrowness, dogmas and bigotry. It is held that God is omnipotent and
omnipresent and that He cannot be identified with any particular deity
or his character properly narrated by any particular legendary or
mythical ways of thinking. At the same time it is contended

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

that we may call him by any name we like, for He is always the same in
all. <span class="margnote"><span id="6-10">10</span></span>

Another great Maratha saint was Tukaram of the seventeenth century.
Tukaram was a low class Hindu. His father was a petty trader. When his
father, in his old age, wanted to give over his business to his eldest
son Savji, the latter refused the task since he did not wish a worldly
life. So the business was entrusted to Tukaram when he was at the age of
thirteen. Four years later his father died. Then Tukaram was imposed
upon by crafty persons and his business was wrecked. His wife, however,
procured a loan; the business was restored and then he began to prosper.
Once, however, while he was returning home, Tukaram met a man who was on
the point of being dragged to prison for his debts. Tukaram at once gave
all that he had to this debtor in order to achieve his release. From
that time on Tukaram renounced all worldly vocations and devoted his
life to singing the glories of God and the dearness of our relations to
Him. He employed a particular kind of verse which he often composed
extempore and in which he frequently spoke. Thus Tukaram says: "God is
ours, certainly ours, and is the soul of all souls. God is near to us,
certainly near, outside and inside. God is benignant, certainly
benignant, and fulfills every longing even of a longing nature." Again
he says: "This thy nature is beyond the grasp of the mind or of words,
and therefore I have made devoted love a measure. I measure the endless
by the measure of love. He is not to be truly measured by any other
means. Thou

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

art not to be found by processes of concentration, sacrificial rites,
practice of austerities, or any bodily exertions, or by knowledge. Oh
Kesava, accept the service which we render to thee in the simplicity of
our hearts." Still again: "The Endless is beyond, and between him and me
there are lofty mountains of desire and anger. I am not able to ascend
them, nor do I find any pass. Insurmountable is the ascent of my
enemies. What possibility is there of my attaining my friend Narayana
(God)?" He expresses his heart full of longing for God in the following
words: <span id="fr_11"></span>[6](#fn_11.md)

"As on the bank the poor fish lies  
And gasps and writhes in pain,  
Or, as a man with anxious eyes  
Seeks hidden gold in vain,--  
So is my heart distressed and cries  
To come to thee again.  
    Thou knowest, Lord, the agony  
    Of the lost infant's wail  
    Yearning his mother's face to see.  
      (How oft I tell this tale.)  
    O, at thy feet the mystery  
Of the dark world unveil.  
The fire of this harassing thought  
Upon my bosom prays.  
Why is it I am thus forgot?  
(O, who can know thy ways?)  
Nay, Lord, thou seest my hapless lot;  
Have mercy, Tuka says."

Desolate and disconsolate for the love of God he prays at His door:

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

"A beggar at thy door,  
Pleading I stand;  
Give me an alms, O God,  
Love from thy loving hand.  
    Spare me the barren task,  
    To come, and to come for nought.  
    A gift poor Tuka craves,  
    Unmerited, unbought."

Again:

"O save me, save me, Mightiest,  
Save me and set me free.  
O let the love that fills my breast  
Cling to thee lovingly.  
    Grant me to taste how sweet thou art;  
    Grant me but this, I pray,  
    And never shall my love depart  
    Or turn from thee away.  
Then I thy name shall magnify  
And tell thy praise abroad,  
For very love and gladness I  
Shall dance before my God.  
    Grant to me, Vitthal, that I rest  
    Thy blessed feet beside;  
    Ah, give me this, the dearest, best,  
    And I am satisfied." <span class="margnote"><span
id="6-11">11</span></span>

Leaving this bhakti movement of the South, which dates from the
thirteenth to the seventeenth century, from Jnanesvar and Namdev to
Tukaram, we pass to the bhakti movement of North India, represented by
Kabir, Nanak and others. It followed the line traced by the Gita and the
Bhagavata. Having been developed in the vernacular, however, it appealed
directly to the masses. It largely dissociated itself from the complex
entanglements of Hindu mythology which had enmeshed

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

the devotional creed of spiritual loyalty to God in the legend of
Krishna and his associates. <span class="margnote"><span
id="6-12">12</span></span>

Kabir (1440-1518) was an abandoned child, probably because of the
illegitimacy of his birth. He was brought up by a weaver, Niru, and his
wife, Nina. Throughout his life he lived in Benares, probably himself
following the profession of a weaver. He is said to have been a disciple
of Ramananda, a disciple of Ramanuja, the great Vaishnava teacher of the
South. But he likewise came into touch with some Mohammedan Pirs and was
also probably acquainted with certain forms of Sufism. His was a
religion which derived its life from what was best among both the Hindus
and the Mohammedans. However, he disliked the bigotry and superstitions
of all formal religions and was consequently persecuted by both the
Hindus and the Mohammedans. With him and his followers, such as Ruidas
and Dadu, we find a religion which shook off all the traditional
limitations of formal religions, with their belief in revealed books and
their acceptance of mythological stories, and of dogmas and creeds that
often obscure the purity of the religious light and contact with God.
Kabir considered the practice of yoga, alms, and fasting, and the
feeding of Brahmins, not only useless but improper without the
repetition of God's name and love for Him. He discarded the Hindu ideas
regarding purity, external ablutions and contact with so-called impure
things with as much force as he rejected the Mohammedan belief in
circumcision or the requirement that a Brahmin should wear a holy
thread, or any other marks of caste. When

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kabir's parents
found that they could not subdue his Hindu tendencies they wanted to
circumcise him, and at this he said:

"Whence have come the Hindus and Mussulmans? Who hath put them in their
different ways,  
Having thought and reflected in thy heart, answer this--who shall obtain
Heaven and who Hell." <span id="fr_12"></span>[7](#fn_12.md) <span
class="margnote"><span id="6-13">13</span></span>

Now we know that the doctrine of bhakti had a great levelling influence.
Even according to the Gita and the Bhagavata Purana, bhakti removed all
inequalities of caste and social status. We know that Haridas (his
Mohammedan name is not known) was converted from Mohammedanism to
Vaishnavism by Chaitanya and Nityananda. In lauding him Chaitanya once
said: "Your holy thoughts are as the streams of the Ganges in which your
soul bathes every hour. Your pious acts earn for you that virtue which
the people seek in sacrificial rites prescribed in the scriptures. You
are constantly in touch with the loftiest of ideals which give you the
same merit as the study of the Vedas. What sadhu or Brahmin is there who
is good and great as you are?" <span id="fr_13"></span>[8](#fn_13.md) In
the Brihat Naradiya Purana we find that even a candala (the lowest caste
among the Hindus) becomes the greatest of all Brahmins if he loves God.
So the new religious ideal of bhakti, in all its enthusiastic circles,
dispensed with

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

the considerations of caste, creed, and social status. <span
class="margnote"><span id="6-14">14</span></span>

There was, therefore, nothing particularly novel in Kabir's insistence
that the time-honored distinctions of caste, creed and social status are
absolutely valueless or in his emphasis upon the need of bhakti for all,
as that which alone exalts a man. But in Kabir we find a reformatory
zeal. He never tires of reiterating the worthlessness of all these
superstitions of caste, creed, social status, external purity and
impurity, penances, asceticism, and all sorts of formalities which
passed by the name of religion though in fact having nothing to do with
it. Thus Kabir says:

"If union with God be obtained by going about naked,  
All the deer of the forest shall be saved.  
What mattereth it whether man goeth naked or weareth a deerskin,  
If he recognize not God in his heart?  
If perfection be obtained by shaving the head,  
Why should not sheep obtain salvation?  
If, O brethren, the continent man is saved,  
Why should not a eunuch obtain the supreme reward?  
Saith Kabir, hear, O my brethren,  
Who hath obtained salvation without God's name?"

Again he says:

"They who battle in the evening and the morning  
Are like frogs in the water.  
When men have no love for God's name,  
They shall all go to the god of death.  
They who love their persons and deck themselves out in various guises,  
Feel not mercy even in their dreams.  
Many leading religious men call them quadrupeds,  
And say that only holy men shall obtain happiness in this ocean of
trouble. <span id="page_160">p. 160</span>  
Saith Kabir, why perform so many ceremonies?  
Forsaking all other essences quaff the great essence of God's name."

These allusions to bathing and other activities refer to religious
practices followed by many Hindus but vigorously denounced by Kabir.
<span class="margnote"><span id="6-15">15</span></span>

To a Yogin who said to Kabir that one could not attain deliverance
without chastening his heart by the performance of yoga Kabir said:

"Without devotion the qualities of the heart cling to the heart,  
Who secured perfection by merely chastening his heart?  
What holy man has succeeded in chastening his heart?  
Say who bath saved any one by merely chastening his heart.  
Every one thinketh in his heart that he is going to chasten it,  
But the heart is not chastened without devotion.  
Saith Kabir, let him who knoweth this secret  
Worship in his heart God, the lord of the three worlds."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kabir in speaking
of the search after God says:

"When I turned my thoughts toward God, I restrained my mind  
and my senses, and my attention became lovingly fixed on Him.  
O Bairagi, search for Him who neither cometh nor goeth, who neither
dieth nor is.  
My soul turning away from sin, is absorbed in the universal soul."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Describing the
view that God is not confined to any mosque, church or temple, Kabir
says:

"If God dwell only in the mosque, to whom belongeth the rest of the
country?  
They who are called Hindus say that God dwelleth in an idol:  
I see not the truth in either sect.  
O God, whether Allah or Ram, I live by Thy name,  
O Lord, show kindness unto me. <span id="page_161">p. 161</span>  
Hari dwelleth in the south, Allah hath his place in the west.  
Search in thy heart, search in thy heart of hearts; there is his place
and abode.  
The Brahmins yearly perform twenty-four fastings . . . the Mussulmans
fast in the month of Ramzan.  
. . . Kabir is a child of Ram and Allah and accepteth all gurus and
Pirs."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Describing his
great love and intoxication for God, Kabir says:

"I am not skilled in book knowledge, nor do I understand controversy:  
I have grown mad reciting and hearing God's praises.  
O father, I am mad; the whole world is sane; I am mad;  
I am ruined; let not others be ruined likewise;  
I have not grown mad out of my own will; God hath made me mad--  
The true guru hath dispelled my doubts--  
I am ruined, and have lost my intellect;  
Let nobody be led astray in doubts like mine.  
He who knoweth not himself is mad;  
When one knoweth himself he knoweth the one God.  
He who is not intoxicated with divine love in this human birth shall
never be so.  
Saith Kabir, I am dyed with the dye of God."

Thus, on the one hand, Kabir waged war against the prevailing
superstitions, rituals and litanies of all religions and religious
sects; and, on the other hand, he dived deep in the depth of God's love
and he beheld nothing but God on all sides, becoming as it were one with
Him in spiritual union. Thus, he says:

"With both mine eyes I look,  
But I behold nothing save God;  
Mine eyes gaze affectionately on Him."

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The motto of his
life was, as he often said, "Remember God, Remember God, Remember God,
my brethren;" and in his own life he felt that he was absorbed in the
Infinite. <span class="margnote"><span id="6-16">16</span></span>

Rui Das (also called Ravi Das), a shoe-maker by caste, was another great
disciple of Ramananda. His songs and hymns are full of humility and
devotion. However, he evidences none of the reformatory zeal that
animated Kabir. I shall quote the translation of only one hymn which
seems to me typical of Rui Das's attitude of love towards God. He says:

"There is none so poor as I, none so compassionate as Thou;  
For this what further test is now necessary?  
May my heart obey thy words, fill thy servant therewith.  
I am a sacrifice to thee, O God;  
Why art thou silent?  
For many births have I been separated from Thee, O God;  
This birth is on thine own account.  
Saith Rui Das, putting my hopes in Thee, I live; it is long since I have
seen thee." <span class="margnote"><span id="6-17">17</span></span>

Still another great saint of love was Mira Bai, a princess of Rajputana,
who from her childhood (born about 1504 A. D.) was devoted to an image
of Lord Krishna called Girdharlal. Her marriage proved unhappy. At the
time of going to her husband's place she became very disconsolate. She
wept until she became unconscious at the idea of leaving the image of
Girdharlal behind. So her parents gave her the image as a part of her
marriage dowry. It proved that Mira could not get on well with the
family of her father-in-law,

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

for she was always given to the adoration and worship of her little
image, representing to her Lord Krishna, and it was this image that she
considered as her husband. Her father-in-law made attempts to kill her,
but she was miraculously saved. Ultimately she left his abode and went
to Brindaban, the place of Lord Krishna's activities, to have her
passion for Krishna realized. Here again, in the case of this princess
saint who left her all for Krishna, we find the potency of the Krishna
legend. <span class="margnote"><span id="6-18">18</span></span>

I shall quote here the translation of one of Mira Bai's hymns which show
her great attachment for Krishna, in an image of whom, at Dvaraka, she
was, as the tradition says, ultimately lost. Her soul was so full of
deep longing for Lord Krishna, or Girdhar as she called him, that she
proclaims:

"I have the god Girdhar and no other;  
He is my spouse on whose head is a crown of peacock feathers,  
Who carrieth a shell, discus, mace and lotus, and who weareth a
necklace;  
I have forfeited the respect of the world by ever sitting near holy
men.  
The matter is now public; everybody knoweth it.  
Having felt supreme devotion I die as I behold the world.  
I have no father, son, or relation with me.  
I laugh when I behold my beloved; people think I weep.  
I have planted the vine of love and irrigated it again  
and again with the water of tears,  
I have cast away my fear of the world, what can anyone do to me  
Mira's love for her god is fixed, come what may." <span
class="margnote"><span id="6-19">19</span></span>

India is a land of saints. There are hundreds of

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

them of whom one could say much. But my time is limited and I have
well-nigh exhausted your patience. Yet I cannot conclude without
referring briefly to Tulsidas, the greatest Hindu poet of India and a
great saint.

Tulsidas lived in the seventeenth century. He did not inaugurate any new
faith, but accepted the Hindu mythology and the theory of the
incarnation of God, the appearance of the attributeless God as a God of
infinite attributes. In his view Rama was the incarnation of God, the
savior and father of mankind. An all-surrendering devotion to him, he
believed, is our only duty and the sole legitimate passion of life. God
is great not only in His greatness, but also in his mercy. He knows the
sins and the frailties of men, and is always prepared to help them repel
their temptations. To run counter to the will of God is sin, and it is
only by acknowledging our sins and taking an all-surrendering refuge in
Him, in love and faith, that we can be saved. Connected herewith was the
doctrine of the brotherhood of man and of our duty toward our neighbors.
Tulsidas is said to have been very much attached to his wife in his
early life. On one occasion he followed her to her father's place, much
to her annoyance, and she said that if he had as much love for God Rama
as he had for her he would be saved. This struck Tulsidas to the heart
and he renounced the world. By his great strength of character, his
remark-able poetic gifts which he applied to religious subjects, and by
his strong faith, Tulsidas soon endeared himself to his countrymen. No
one has exercised a greater

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

influence than he over the Hindi-speaking people of North India. <span
class="margnote"><span id="6-20">20</span></span>

I have now described, though but briefly, some of the main types of
Indian mysticism in their mutual relations; others could not be so much
as touched upon owing to the limitations of time. I am fully alive to
the imperfections of my treatment. Great as they are, they must have
appeared to you even greater on account of the difficulty that you must
have experienced in placing yourselves on the mental plane of these
mystics. The subtle metaphysical and philosophical background of these
different types of mysticism I have here been compelled to disregard.
But I have elsewhere undertaken an historical survey of all the
different systems of Indian Philosophy. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[9](#fn_14.md) Through oral instruction, tradition, and
the example of great men who renounced the world in pursuance of the
high ideals of philosophy, the essence of these different systems, with
their spiritual longings and their yearnings after salvation and the
cessation of rebirth, have gradually been filtering down into the minds
of the masses of the population. The tiller of the soil and the grocer
in the shop may be uneducated and often wholly illiterate, but even
they, while tilling the ground, driving a bullock cart or resting after
the work of the day, will be singing songs full of mystical meaning, and
for the moment transporting themselves

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

to regions beyond the touch of material gains and comforts:

"The sky and the earth are born of mine own eyes.  
The hardness and softness, the cold and the heat are the products of my
own body;  
The sweet smell and the bad are of my own nose."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Or,

"Nobody can tell whence the bird unknown  
Comes into the cage and goes out.  
I would feign put round its feet the fetter of my mind  
Could I but capture it." <span id="fr_15"></span>[10](#fn_15.md)

A traveller in the village of Bengal or on board the steamers plying the
rivers of the interior of rural Bengal, may often hear a middle-aged or
old Mohammedan or a Hindu singing mystical, philosophical or mythical
songs of the love of Krishna and Radha, or of the renouncement of the
world by Chaitanya, while a large crowd of men is assembled around the
singer listening to him with great reverence and feeling. The singer is
probably describing the world as a mirage or a mere phantom show of
*maya*, or is expressing the futility of his worldly life on account of
his having lost his friendship with his own self.

"My hope of the world is all false,  
What shall be my fate, O kind, good lord?  
I am not in love with him (self) with whom  
I have come to live in this house (body)  
O kind, good lord."

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

So the sublime teachings of philosophy and the other-worldly aspirations
of mysticism, with their soothing, plaintive and meditative tendencies,
have watered the hearts of Bengal right into the thatched cottages of
this land. Wealth and comfort they all appreciate as do people
everywhere, but they all know that money is not everything, and that
peace of mind and the ultimate good of man cannot be secured through it
or any other worldly thing. They are immersed in the world; but still
the wisdom of the ages and the teachings of the saints have not been in
vain, and at times they are drawn away from the world--their souls
unknowingly long for deliverance and find a mystic delight in it. It is
only the educated or Anglicized Hindu who, dazzled by the gay colors of
the West, sometimes turns a deaf ear to the old tune of his country--the
flute of Krishna calling from afar through the rustling leaves of
bamboos and the cocoanut groves of the village homes--and, in the name
of patriotism and progress, installs a foreign god of money and luxury
in the ancestral throne of the god of the Indian heart--the god of
deliverance. The thoughts and aspirations of the ages, our myths, our
religions, our philosophies, our songs and poetry, have all
interpenetrated and formed a whole which cannot be expressed through a
portrayal of its elements. They represent a unique experience which I
feel with my countrymen, but which is incommunicable to any one who is
unable imaginatively to bring himself into tune with that spirit. The
British in India have understood as much

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

of the country as is necessary for policing it, but no foreigner has
ever adequately understood our land. Those of you who see India through
newspapers and the strange tales and stories of tourists who "do" India
in a month, can hardly hope to go right to the place where the heart of
India lies. <span class="margnote"><span id="6-21">21</span></span>

But, you may perhaps ask, what may I gain by knowing India as it really
is at its heart? Well, that is a different matter. Perhaps you may
derive gain, perhaps not. You may further ask what is it that one gains
through such spiritual longing, realization, or mystical rapture. And I
shall frankly confess that one certainly gains nothing that will show
itself in one's bank account. But with all my appreciation and
admiration of the great achievements of the West in science, politics
and wealth, the Upanishad spirit in me may whisper from within: What
have you gained if you have not gained yourself, the immortal, the
infinite? What have you gained if you have never tasted in your life the
deep longing for deliverance and supreme emancipation? And the spirit of
the saints of ages whispers in my ears: What have you gained if you have
not tasted the joys of self-surrender, if your heart has not longed to
make of you a flute in the hands of Krishna, that master musician of the
universe, and if you have not been able to sweeten all your miseries
with a touch of God? <span class="margnote"><span
