# PREFACE

BOTH on the continent and in America, Hindus are associated with
mysticism, but, so far as I know, the subject of Hindu mysticism has as
yet received no systematic treatment, either in the way of general
introduction, or in the way of a comprehensive account. The man in the
street cannot, as a rule, distinguish between the lower and the higher
forms of mysticism. He looks upon mysticism in general with some kind of
superstitious awe or reverence, and he thinks of it as an obscure and
supernatural method by which, in some unaccountable manner, miraculous
feats may be performed or physical advantages reaped--departed spirits
made visible, fortunes told, muscles developed, riches earned without
effort, dangerous and incurable diseases cured by simple amulets or
blessings, infallible prophesies made, and the like. I shall not say
anything as to whether or not such phenomena are possible, for my
present interest concerns not facts but beliefs. But whether or not the
phenomena actually occur, they imply beliefs that there are short cuts
to the attainment of advantages through mysterious, supernatural or
miraculous powers undiscoverable by reason. I refer to this as inferior
mysticism, because the purposes relate solely to the attainment of
inferior

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

mundane benefits. Distinguishable therefrom is the belief that the
highest reality or the ultimate realisation and fulfilment (whatever may
be their nature) cannot be attained by reason alone, but that there are
other avenues to them, namely, the firm and steady control of will, the
development of right emotions, or both combined, or by them both along
with the highest functioning of reason. This is superior and true
mysticism because it is directed to the liberation of the spirit and the
attainment of the highest bliss.

Mysticism in Europe has a definite history. In spite of the variety of
its types, it may roughly be described to refer to the belief that God
is realised through ecstatic communion with Him. With the Islamic
mystics, the Christian mystics, and the devotional mystics or bhaktas of
India, the vision of God and His grace is attained through devotional
communion or devotional rapture of various kinds. But in all these
mystics, we find a keen sense of the necessity of purity of mind,
contentment, ever alert striving for moral goodness, self-abnegation,
and one-pointedness to God. There can be no true mysticism without real
moral greatness. This mysticism should therefore be distinguished from a
mere delusory faith that God often grants us a vision of Him or appears
to us in dreams, or from a faith in the infallibility of the scriptures
and so forth, for the latter are often but manifestations of credulity
or of a tendency to believe in suggestions, and may often be associated
with an inadequate alertness of critical and synthetic intellect.

I have defined mysticism as a belief or a view, but in reality it means
much more than that. In the life of the true mystics, beliefs exert a
great formative influence. They are no mere intellectual registrations
of opinions or temporary experiences, but represent the dynamic, the
dominant tone of their personality as it develops and perfects itself.
Mysticism is not an intellectual theory; it is fundamentally an active,
formative, creative, elevating and ennobling principle of life. I have
not here taken note of poems or thoughts involving merely mystical
beliefs but have touched only upon those which are the outward
expressions of a real inner flowering of life in the persons of those
who have tried to live a saintly life of mysticism.

Mysticism means a spiritual grasp of the aims and problems of life in a
much more real and ultimate manner than is possible to mere reason. A
developing life of mysticism means a gradual ascent in the scale of
spiritual values, experience, and spiritual ideals. As such, it is
many-sided in its development, and as rich and complete as life itself.
Regarded from this point of view, mysticism is the basis of all
religions--particularly of religion as it appears in the lives of truly
religious men.

An acquaintance with Indian religious experience shows that there are
types of religious and mystical experience other than that of an
intimate communion with God. I have therefore made my definition of
mysticism wider, so that it may include not only the Islamic, Christian,
and the Bhakti forms of Indian

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

mysticism but other types of Indian mysticism as well. I could not hope
to give an exhaustive analysis or even a fairly comprehensive treatment
of the chief features of the different types of Indian mysticism within
the limits of these six lectures. I have therefore attempted only a
brief general outline of some of the most important types, indicating
their mutual relations, sometimes genetically and sometimes logically. I
have omitted all reference to the connected metaphysical issues, as a
comprehensive treatment of these philosophical problems may be found in
my "A History of Indian Philosophy" (Cambridge University Press), the
first volume of which has already been published and the other volumes
are in the course of publication.

I have first described the sacrificial type of mysticism. This cannot in
all its particulars be regarded as a mysticism of a superior order, but
it develops many features of the higher types and marks the
starting-point of the evolution of Indian mysticism. I have then
discussed the four chief types of mysticism: the Upanishad, the Yogic,
the Buddhistic and the Bhakti, though there are many branches of these
particular types upon which I could not enter. I have mentioned some
other minor types of mysticism. In addition there are some which are of
a syncretistic nature, exhibiting elements of belief and duties of two
or three distinct types of mysticism in combination. I could not present
them all. The five main types that I have here described, however, may
be regarded as fundamental;

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

and, though very much more could have been said in the way of
elaboration and illustration, all their striking characteristics have
been briefly touched upon and materials have largely been drawn directly
from the original sources. I hope that I may in the future have an
opportunity to take up the subject again and to deal with it more
elaborately.

Perhaps I should have entitled the present volume "The Development of
Indian Mysticism." But the word "Indian" might be misunderstood in
America. I have therefore selected "Hindu Mysticism," "Hindu" standing
for Indian. I have dropped the word "Development" to avoid any initial
impression of forbidding technicality. For similar reasons diacritical
marks have been omitted.

I now have the very pleasant duty of thanking the Harris Foundation
Lecture Committee which did me the honour of asking me to deliver these
lectures and President Walter Dill Scott, Professor Edward L. Schaub and
Professor T. W. Koch, the Secretary of the committee. Considering the
high reputation of my predecessors, who were outstanding scholars in
their respective branches of learning, I feel extremely diffident about
my own humble performance. I have received so much hospitality and
kindness in America that I shall always think of this great country with
appreciative enthusiasm and admiration. But I can never express
adequately my gratefulness and thanks to Professor Edward L. Schaub, who
was chiefly responsible for my invitations to the American Universities

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

and who helped me so generously in seeing these lectures through the
press, as well as in suggesting many changes of style and expression--to
say nothing of his personal courtesies and cordiality which will always
endear his name to me.
