### CHAPTER VI

### SUNDAY AT THE TEMPLE

i

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> nineteenth of August, 1883, fell on
Sunday and was the first day after the full moon, so the devotees had
leisure to come and see their beloved Master at Dakshineswara. Everyone
had free access. He talked with everybody who came. His visitors were
from all classes of people,—Sannyâsins <span
id="fr_45"></span>[\*](#fn_45.md) and Paramahamsas, <span
id="fr_46"></span>[†](#fn_46.md) Hindus, Christians and Brâhmos, Sâktas,
Vaishnavas and Shaivas,—women as well as men. It was noon. Srî
Râmakrishna was seated in His usual place in His room. A disciple came
and saluted Him, falling at His

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

hallowed feet. The Bhagavân made him sit down and kindly inquired after
the welfare of himself and of his family. A short while after the
Bhagavân began to talk to him upon the Vedânta. He said:

<span class="margnote">Non-dualistic Vedantins.</span>The Astâvakara
Samhitâ <span id="fr_47"></span>[\*](#fn_47.md) deals with the knowledge of
the Âtman (Self). The knowers of the Self declare: "I am He, I am that
Supreme Self." This is the view of all the Sannyâsins belonging to the
non-dualistic (Advaita) school of Vedânta. But it is not meet that a man
of the world should hold such a view. He is doing all kinds of work; how
at the same time can he be that Highest Self, the Absolute Brahman, who
is beyond all actions? The Non-dualistic Vedantins hold that the Self
has no attachment to anything. Pleasure, pain, virtue, vice, can never
affect the Self in any way; but they do affect men who think that their
soul is the same as the body. Smoke can blacken only the wall, but not
the space through which it moves. There was a certain devotee named
Krishna Kisore, who used to say that he was *Kha*, or empty space. He

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

meant that he was the same as the Highest Self, Brahman the Absolute,
who is sometimes likened to Âkâsa (infinite space) because nothing can
be predicated of It. A true philosopher has some right to say this. As
for others, such a sentiment is altogether out of place.

Thought of freedom brings freedom. But it is good for everyone to
cherish the idea that he is free. "I am free," "I am free"; if a man
constantly says this, he is sure to be free. On the other hand, he who
always thinks that he is in bondage brings bondage on himself in the
end. The weak-minded man who always says, "I am a sinner," "I am a
sinner," is sure to have a fall. A man should rather say: "I repeat the
Holy Name of God; how can there be any sin in me, or bondage of the
world?"

Then turning towards the disciple, the Bhagavân said:

To-day my mind is not at ease. I hear from Hridai <span
id="fr_48"></span>[\*](#fn_48.md) that he has been ailing much. Is this

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

<span class="margnote">Mâyâ and Dayâ.</span>anxiety due to Mâyâ
(attachment) or Dayâ (compassion) towards him?

The disciple did not know what to reply and remained silent.

Srî Râmakrishna: Do you know what is Mâyâ? Love towards one's own
father, brother, sister, wife, child, nephew, niece, is called Mâyâ, and
compassion means loving all beings equally. Now what is this, my
anxiety, due to—Mâyâ or compassion? But Hridai did a great deal for me.
He served me much. He never hesitated to do all sorts of menial services
for me. My mind will be set at rest if he can get the money he needs.
Now whom am I to ask for money? And how can I ask, being a Sannyâsin?

At two or three o'clock in the afternoon two great devotees, Adhar <span
id="fr_49"></span>[\*](#fn_49.md) and Balarâm, came and prostrated
themselves before Him and took their seats. They asked Him how He was
doing. The Bhagavân replied: "Well, my body is all right, but not so is
the mind." He did not mention anything about Hridâya's illness.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

ii

In the course of the conversation, when the talk was about the Goddess
*Simhavâhini* <span id="fr_50"></span>[\*](#fn_50) (seated upon a lion.md)
belonging to the Mullik family of Barabâzâr, He said: Once I went to see
the Simhavâhini. She was then staying in one Mullik's house at
Châshâdhopâpârâ. The house was almost a deserted one. The family had
become very poor. In some places there was filth, in other places mosses
were growing undisturbed. The cement upon the wall was crumbling down,
and brick-dust and sand were slowly falling. Other houses belonging to
the Mulliks are very neat and clean, but this was not so. Can you
explain why this was the case? The truth is that everyone must reap the
fruit of his past actions. <span class="margnote">Law of Karma.</span>We
should believe in the law of Karma. One thing, however, I saw in that
deserted house,—that the face of the Goddess was beaming with glory.
<span class="margnote">The Divine Presence in images.</span>We should
believe in the Divine Presence infilling the images of the Deity.

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

I went to Vishnupura. <span id="fr_51"></span>[\*](#fn_51.md) The Râjâ has
several good temples. In one of the temples there is the image of a
Goddess named Mrinmayi. A big tank is before the temple. But how was it
that I smelled in the tank the spices that women use to perfume their
hair? I did not know that they offered such spices to the Goddess when
they went to worship her. I had not seen her image near the tank, but in
Samâdhi I saw her Divine form down to her waist. The Divine Mother of
the universe appeared to me in the form of Mrinmayi.

By this time other devotees had arrived. The talk then turned on the
Kabul war and the civil war that came after. One gave the news that
Yâkub Khân <span id="fr_52"></span>[†](#fn_52.md) had been deposed from his
throne, adding: Sir, Yâkub Khân is a great devotee.

<span class="margnote">Trials of a devotee.</span>Srî Râmakrishna: Well,
pleasure and pain, happiness and misery, are things one cannot separate
from the body. We read in Kavi Kankana's <span
id="fr_53"></span>[‡](#fn_53.md) "Chandi" that Kâluvira, a great devotee,
was shut up in prison.

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They placed a
heavy stone upon his breast. Yet Kâlu was the favorite child of the
Mother of the universe. Pleasure and pain, happiness and misery, come
with the body. How great a devotee was Srimanta! How fondly the goddess
loved his mother Khullanâ! But what an amount of trouble he had to go
through! They took him to the scaffold to be executed. A certain
woodman, a great devotee, was fortunate enough to see the goddess, and
the goddess loved him very much and showed her kindness towards him; but
he had to go on with the trade of woodcutter all the same. He had to
sell firewood to get his livelihood. It does not follow that a devoted
lover of God must be very well off in the world. <span
class="margnote">A devotee is rich in spirit.</span>But he is rich in
spirit, though he may be poor in worldly things. Devaki in prison saw
God in the form of a human being holding the conch-shell, discus, mace
and lotus in His four hands; but she could not get out of the prison for
all her God-vision.

Disciple: But she should have got rid, not only of imprisonment, but of
her body, that being the source of all her troubles.

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

<span class="margnote">Body result of past actions.</span>Bhagavân:
One's body is the result of one's past actions. Therefore one must bear
with it so long as the past actions are not cleared up. A blind man
taking a bath in the holy water of the Ganges has his sins washed off,
but his blindness continues all the same. It is the result of the
actions of his previous life. But however the body may be under the
influence of pleasure and pain, however the body may be happy or
miserable, the true devotee is all the same rich in spirit, rich in
knowledge (Jnâna) and the love of God (Bhakti). Take for instance the
Pândavas. How many dangers and difficulties they had to face! What wants
and miseries to bear! But amidst all these they never lost their wisdom.
Can you find others equally wise and devoted to God?

At this time Narendra (Swâmi Vivekânanda) and Visvanâtha
Upâdhyâya, <span id="fr_54"></span>[\*](#fn_54.md) the Nepaulese Resident
in Calcutta, entered. Bowing down to Srî Râmakrishna, they took their
seats. Srî Râmakrishna asked Narendra to sing. There

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

was hanging on the western wall of the room a Tânpurâ (a stringed
musical instrument). Narendra took it down and began to tune it.
Everyone was intently looking upon his face, eager to listen to his
songs.

Bhagavân to Narendra: This instrument no longer sounds as before.

Visvanâtha: It is filled, therefore there is no sound, as with a vessel
filled with water.

Srî Râmakrishna: But how do you explain the life of Nârada and of other
Divine Teachers? They had realized God, but still spoke. They were
filled, but they gave forth sounds.

Visvanâtha: They spoke for the good of mankind.

Bhagavân: Yes, Nârada and Sukadeva came down from the highest state of
Samâdhi. Their hearts went out to those who were weary and heavy-laden
and knew not God. They spoke for the good of others.

Narendra began to sing:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. In the temple of the heart dwelleth the Eternal Truth.  
Ever beholding His glorious and lovely form, when shall we dive in the
sea of His Beauty?

</div>

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

2\. In the form of Infinite Wisdom the Lord will enter my soul.  
The restless mind filled with wonder will take refuge at His Blessed
Feet.  
Immortal Bliss, like embodied nectar, will rise in the firmament of the
soul.

3\. At Thy sight we shall be mad with joy even as the *Chakora* <span
id="fr_55"></span>[\*](#fn_55.md) is maddened at the sight of the moon.

4\. O King of kings, there is none like Thee, all good and all
peaceful.  
At Thy feet, O Beloved, I shall offer myself and thus fulfil the aim of
my life.

5\. Even here shall I enjoy heavenly bliss, so great a privilege where
could I find?

6\. O Lord, beholding Thy pure and perfect form, all sins will take
flight, even as darkness vanishes before light.

7\. O kindle in my heart the light of burning faith, fixed firm like the
polar star, and thus, O Friend of the meek, fulfil ray one desire. Day
and night merged in the

</div>

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bliss of Thy Love.
O I shall forget myself having attained to Thee.  
              (O when will this come?)

</div>

<span class="margnote">Samâdhi of Râmakrishna.</span>Srî Râmakrishna had
lost Himself in deep Samâdhi as soon as He had heard the words "Immortal
bliss like embodied nectar." There He sat with clasped hands, turning
His face toward the East. He was diving deep into the Ocean of Beauty of
the All-Blissful One. No external consciousness, no sign of breathing,
no motion in any of His limbs, no quiver of the eye,—like one drawn in a
picture! He had gone away somewhere from this kingdom, from this world
of the senses.

Returning from Samâdhi, the Bhagavân murmured in an indistinct voice:
"Thou art I, I am Thou. Thou eatest, Thou and I eat. What is this? Have
I jaundiced eyes? I see Thee everywhere. Wherever I cast my eyes, I see
Thy form." Then He repeated the holy name of Krishna: "O Friend of the
meek and gentle! O Lord of my heart! O Divine Shepherd!" After repeating
this a few times, He again went into Samâdhi. Coming back to
sense-consciousness, He opened His eyes and found that the room was full
of people of every

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

class. Narendra, seeing that the Bhagavân was in Samâdhi, had left the
room and gone to the eastern veranda, where Hâzrâ <span
id="fr_56"></span>[\*](#fn_56.md) was seated on a blanket telling his
beads. Narendra began to talk with him. In the meanwhile the Bhagavân
looked for Narendra in the room, but he was not there. The *Tânpurâ*
(musical instrument) was lying on the ground. The devotees all had their
eyes fixed upon the Bhagavân, who began thus, referring to Narendra: He
has lighted the fire. It matters not whether he remains in the room or
leaves it!

<span class="margnote">Bliss comes in meditation.</span>Then turning
towards Visvanâtha and His numerous devotees, He said: Meditate upon
God, the sole Existence, Knowledge and Bliss Eternal, and you also shall
have bliss. That Being of Knowledge and Bliss is always here and
everywhere, only It is covered and obscured by ignorance. The less is
your attachment towards the senses, the more will be your love for God.

Visvanâtha: The more we near our home at Calcutta, the farther we are
from Benares, and the more we near Benares, the farther we are away from
our home.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

<span class="margnote">Lover of God.</span>Bhagavân: As Srimati
(Râdhâ) <span id="fr_57"></span>[\*](#fn_57.md) neared Srî Krishna, she
perceived more and more the charming fragrance of His sweet person. The
more one approaches God, the more does one's love toward Him increase.
The more the river nears the sea, the more it is subject to ebb and
flow. The Ganges of knowledge flowing in the soul of a wise man runs
only in one direction. To him the whole universe is a dream. He always
lives in His own True Self (Âtman). But the Ganges of love in a
devotee's heart does not run in one direction. It has its ebb and flow.
A devotee laughs, weeps, dances, sings. He wants sometimes to enjoy his
Beloved, to merge into his Beloved! He swims in Him, dives, rises up in
his joy as merrily as a lump of ice floats upon the water. <span
class="margnote">God the Absolute  and God the Creator one.</span>But in
fact God the Absolute and God the Creator are one and the same Being.
The Absolute Existence-Intelligence-Bliss is the All-knowing,
All-intelligent and All-blissful Mother of the Universe. The precious
stone (*Mani*) and its brightness cannot be separated in thought, for

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

we cannot think of the stone without its brightness, nor can we think of
the brightness apart from the stone. The Absolute
Existence-Intelligence-Bliss, the Undifferentiated, appears as
differentiated into many. He has various names applied to Him according
to the various powers manifested. That is the reason of His having many
forms. Hence a devotee has sung: "O my Mother Târâ, <span
id="fr_58"></span>[\*](#fn_58.md) Thou art even all that." Wherever there
is action, such as creation, preservation and destruction, there is
Sakti or Intelligent Energy. But water is water whether it is calm or
disturbed. That One Absolute Existence-Intelligence-Bliss is also the
eternally Intelligent Energy which creates, preserves and destroys the
universe. Thus it is the same Visvanâtha whether he does nothing or
performs his worship or visits the Governor-General. In all cases it is
the same Visvanâtha, only these are his different Upâdhis or states.

Visvanâtha: Yes, Sir, that is so.

Bhagavân: I said this to Keshab Chandra Sen.

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

Visvanâtha: Well, Sir, Keshab Chandra Sen does not respect our orthodox
Hindu manners, customs and laws. How can he be a real saint?

The Bhagavân (turning towards His devotees): Visvanâtha never wants me
to go to see Keshab Sen.

Visvanâtha: But Thy Holiness will go. What can I do?

Bhagavân: You go to see the Governor-General, who according to your
Shâstras <span id="fr_59"></span>[\*](#fn_59) is a Mleccha (unclean.md),
and for money, too; and may I not go to see Keshab Sen? It does not
become you to speak in this way. You often say: "It is God who has
manifested Himself as the human soul and the world itself." What you say
you must mean; what you mean you must say!

After this Râmakrishna abruptly left the room and went to the
northeastern veranda. Visvanâtha and other devotees remained waiting for
Him in the room. Narendra was found talking with Hâzrâ on the veranda.
Srî Râmakrishna knew that Hâzrâ was an out-and-out non-dualist and a dry
logician. He upheld that all the universe was a mere dream; that all

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

kinds of worship and offerings were mental delusions; that God was the
one changeless Entity; and that a man should only meditate upon his
Âtman (Self), and do nothing else.

Bhagavân (laughing): What are you talking about?

Narendra: We are discussing themes all too big for ordinary mortals.

<span class="margnote">Pure Bhakti and pure Jnâna one.</span>Bhagavân.
(laughing): But however you may talk, know that pure selfless devotion
(Bhakti) and pure selfless knowledge (Jnâna) are both one; their goal is
the same Smooth and easy is the path of devotion leading to God.

Narendra: There is no use in reasoning like a philosopher; make me, O
Mother, mad with Thy love. I have been reading Hamilton's Philosophy,
and he writes: "A learned ignorance is the end of philosophy and the
beginning of religion."

Bhagavân: What does that mean?

Narendra explained it in Bengali. Srî Râmakrishna laughed and thanked
him in English, saying, "Thank you!" Everyone laughed at this, for the
Bhagavân's knowledge of English was confined to a few such expressions.

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

iii

Soon twilight began to fall. The devotees one after another took leave
of the Bhagavân, and so did Narendra.

<span class="margnote">Evening at the Temple.</span>The day was drawing
to a close. The Temple-servant was arranging the lights. The priests
were busy saying their prayers as they stood waist-deep in the sacred
waters of the Ganges, purifying themselves body and soul. They were
shortly to go to their respective temples to perform the *Ârati*, the
evening ceremony. The young men of Dakshineswara had come with their
friends to take a walk in the garden. They were strolling about the
rampart, enjoying the sweet evening breeze made fragrant by the flowers
and watching the slightly undulating breast of the swiftly-flowing
Ganges. Some of them, perhaps the more thoughtful, could be found going
about by themselves in the solitude of the sacred trees called the
*Panchavati*.

Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna also looked at the Ganges for some time from
the western veranda.

It was evening. The lamp-lighter had lighted all the lamps of the big
temple. The old maid-servant

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

came and lit the lamp in the Bhagavân's room and burned incense there.
In the meantime the Ârati ceremony had begun in the twelve shrines
dedicated to Shiva. It began soon after in the temples of Kâli, Mother
of the Universe, and of Srî Vishnu. The united and solemn sound of
gongs, bells, cymbals, grew more solemn and sweet as it was echoed back
by the murmuring Ganges below.

It was the first lunar day after the full moon. A short while after
nightfall the moon rose. Gradually the tops of the trees in the garden,
as well as the big temple compound, were bathed in her balmy light. At
the magic touch of her radiance the waters of the Ganges shone bright
like silver and flowed on dancing with great joy.

When at nightfall Srî Râmakrishna bowed down to the Divine Mother, He
repeated the Holy Names of God, keeping time all the while by clapping
his hands. In His room there were pictures of various Incarnations of
God. He bowed before each picture, repeating the Holy Name of each. He
also repeated His favorite *mantrams*, each having some lofty, unifying
principle running through it, such as:

\(1\) Brahma-Âtmâ-Bhagavân. (The Absolute Brahman of the Vedânta, True
Self and the

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Personal God of
the Bhakta are three in one and one in three.)

\(2\) Bhâgavata-Bhakta-Bhagavân. (The Word, the devotee and the Personal
God are three in one and one in three.)

\(3\) Brahma-Sakti, Sakti-Brahma. (God the Absolute and the Creative
Energy are one and the same.)

\(4\) Veda-Purâna-Tantra-Gitâ-Gâyatri. (God of the Scriptures and Holy
texts.)

\(5\) Saranâgata, Saranâgata. (I take refuge in Thee. I am Thine, I am
Thine.)

\(6\) Nâham-Nâham, Tuhu-Tuhu. (Not I, not I, but Thou, but Thou.)

\(7\) Ami Yantra, tumi yantri. (I am the machine; Thou art the One who
runs the machine.)

After all these repetitions were ended, He meditated upon the Mother
Divine with clasped hands.

A few of the devotees had been walking about in the garden during the
evening. When the Ârati ceremonies were over in the temples, one after
another they came together in Srî Râmakrishna's room.

He was sitting on His seat with devotees before Him on the floor. He
said: Narendra,

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Râkhâl and
Bhavanâtha—these are Nityasiddhas (perfect even from their birth). They
need no training. What training they go through is more than they need.
You see that Narendra never cares for anyone. He was with me in
Visvanâtha's carriage the other day. When he was requested to sit upon
the better seat, he paid no heed at all. Moreover, he never shows to me
that he knows anything, lest I praise him before men. He has no Mâyâ, no
attachment. He looks as if he were free from all bondage. For a single
individual he has many gifts and many noble qualities. He is also very
courteous in his manners. He knows how to control his senses; he has
said that he will not marry, but will live a pure life. That is good. I
always go into Samâdhi when I see him.

<span class="margnote">Character and associations.</span>We mould our
character according to the company we keep; and we keep such company as
is in harmony with our character. For this reason the Paramahamsas
(perfected souls) like to keep the company of innocent children because
their minds are pure, simple and unstained by worldliness.

As Srî Râmakrishna was speaking these words, a worthy Brahmin entered
the room and bowed

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

down at His feet. The Bhagavân had known him before and loved him
because he was sincere and simple. He had studied Vedânta in Benares,
the seat of great learning. Râmakrishna said to him: Well, you have not
been here for a long time. How are you?

The Brâhmin, smiling, replied: "Revered Sir, the duties of the world, as
Thou knowest, take most of my time."

He then took his seat and Râmakrishna continued: You remained in Benares
for a long time. Tell us what you saw there. Let us hear something about
Dayânanda. <span id="fr_60"></span>[\*](#fn_60.md)

Brahmin: Yes, I met Dayânanda. Thou hast also seen him.

Râmakrishna: Yes, I went to see him once. He was staying in a
garden-house not very far from here. That day he had an appointment with
Keshab Sen. He was a great scholar; he also believed in the Devas
(perfected spirits), but Keshab did not, whereupon he said: "If

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> God created all
these phenomena, could He not create Devas?" He believed in one God, but
without form. Visvanâtha was repeating the Holy Name of the Lord, "Râma,
Râma"; at this he said: "Better repeat the name 'Sandesha, Sandesha'
(sweetmeat, sweetmeat)."

Brâhmin: In Benares, Dayânanda had long theological discussions with the
other pandits. In the end all the pandits unanimously stood on one side,
while he stood alone on the other; and then the pandits drove him from
the city by raising the outcry: "Dayânanda's position is false and must
not be accepted!" I also saw Colonel Olcott, the Theosophist. The
theosophists believe in the existence of the Mahâtmâs, the realm of the
moon, the realm of the sun and the astral realms. They believe that the
astral bodies go to these places and so on. Revered Sir, what dost Thou
think of Theosophy?

<span class="margnote">Devotion to the Supreme.</span>Râmakrishna:
Bhakti, devotion to the Supreme, is the only thing worth having. Do they
seek Bhakti? Then it is good. If their aim be the realization of God,
then they are all right; but by simply dwelling upon these realms and
Mahâtmâs one cannot search after God. One should practise Sâdhana
(devotional exercises) to attain true Bhakti.

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> One should have
extreme longing for realization. One should gather up all the mental
activities and concentrate them upon Him. Realization of God does not
come so easily; it requires a great deal of Sâdhana. A man asked: "Why
can I not see God?" I replied: "If you wish to catch a big fish, which
lives in deep water, you will have to make many preparations to attract
him. You must get the line, rod, hook and float; you must put on savory
bait; then when you see bubbles in the water, you may know that he has
come near. Similarly, if you wish to see God, devote yourself to the
practice of true Bhakti."

<span class="margnote">Bhakti and Jnâna.</span>A devotee: Which is
better, Bhakti or Jnâna?

Râmakrishna: The highest form of Bhakti comes through extreme love for
God. Three friends were walking through a forest. A tiger appeared. One
of them cried out: "Brother, we shall be devoured by the tiger"; the
second said: "Why shall we be devoured? Come, let us pray to the Lord."
Hearing this, the third one replied: "Oh no, why trouble the Lord? Let
us climb this tree." The man who said, "We shall be devoured," did not
know that the Lord is the protector of all; he who wished to pray to the
Lord

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

was a Jnâni; he knew that the Lord is the Creator, Protector and
Destroyer of all phenomena; but the third man, who said, "Why trouble
the Lord, let us climb the tree," was a true lover of God. He had had
the taste of Divine Love, the highest form of Bhakti. In one aspect of
Divine Love (Prema) the lover thinks of himself as greater than the
object of love; he has the constant desire to protect the Beloved and
make Him happy by removing all troubles and anxieties. The Gopis had
true Prema, or Divine Love.

<span class="margnote">Divine Love and its various aspects.</span>In
Divine Love the sense of "I" and "mine" exists, as was shown by the
mother of the Divine Incarnation, Krishna. For her, Krishna was only a
son and not the Lord of the universe. She loved to nurse Him and take
care of Him, always calling Him "my Krishna," and feeling the same
anxiety about Him that an earthly mother would feel about her son. When
a certain saint spoke to her, saying: "Your Krishna is the absolute
Master of the world; He is not human"; Yasodâ, the mother of Krishna,
replied: "Oh no, He is not the Lord of the universe; He is my child. I
cannot think of Him as other than my child." Divine Love is manifested

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

by various relations; the closer the relation, the stronger the tie of
love. The relation of a servant to his master was manifested by Hanumân;
the relation of a friend to his friend was shown by Arjuna to Krishna;
while the Gopis were devoted to the Lord as their Divine husband.

Some people think that they are bound (Baddha), that they will never
attain to Divine Wisdom, or to Divine Love. But all this fear vanishes
from the heart of a true disciple if his Guru, or spiritual guide, be
gracious to him. <span class="margnote">Parable of the
tiger.</span>There was a flock of sheep in the woods; suddenly a tigress
jumped into their midst. At that moment she gave birth to a cub and died
on the spot. The kindhearted sheep took care of the cub, and brought it
up among them. They ate grass, the cub followed their example; they
bleated, the cub also learned to bleat. In this manner the cub grew up
not as a young tiger but like a sheep. One day a full-grown tiger came
that way and watched with wonder the grass-eating tiger. The real tiger
drew nearer, but the cub began to bleat. Then the real tiger dragged him
to the edge of a lake and said: "Look here! Compare your face with mine.
Is there any

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

difference? You are a tiger like me; grass is not your food; your food
is animal flesh." But the grass-eating tiger could not believe it. After
a long time the real tiger convinced him that he was of the same
species. Then he gave him a piece of flesh to eat, but he would not
touch it; 'he began once more to bleat and to seek for grass. At last,
however, the real tiger forced him to eat animal flesh; at once he liked
the taste of the blood, gave up his grass-eating and bleating, and
realized that he was not a sheep but a tiger. He then followed the real
tiger and became like him.

<span class="margnote">Human soul, the child of God.</span>The human
soul is the child of God, but it does not know it, and therefore it
lives like an ordinary mortal (sheep); but when, by the grace of the
Guru, he realizes his true nature, he becomes free from all fear and
attains to perfection. Therefore I say, when the grace of the Guru
comes, all fear vanishes. He will make you know who you are and what you
are in reality. You will have to do very little for yourself after you
have received that grace. You will then be able to distinguish between
the Real and the unreal and to realize that God is Truth and the world
is unreal.

<span class="margnote">  Parable of the false Sâdhu.</span>A fisherman
came to a garden at night and threw his net in the pond to catch some
fish. Hearing the noise, the owner sent his men to capture him. The men
came with torches in their hands to discover the thief. In the meantime
the fisherman dropped his net, covered his face with ashes and sat under
a tree, pretending to be a holy man absorbed in meditation. The men
could not find the thief; they simply noticed that a holy man was
meditating under a tree, so they returned to the owner and told him what
they had seen. Everybody then brought flowers, fruits, and sweets to the
holy man and paid him great honor and respect. Next morning crowds of
people came to see the Sâdhu and offered to him money and various other
things. The fisherman thought: "How strange it is! I am not a holy man,
still people have so much respect for me and I have received so many
gifts. If I become a genuine Sâdhu (Anchoret), how much more I shall
get! Undoubtedly I shall see God." If merely feigning to be a holy man
could so far awaken him, what can be said of him who has practised all
virtues in order to become a true holy man! He will realize what is Real
and what is

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

unreal, that God is Truth and the world is unreal.

A devotee: Where shall I meditate on God? Râmakrishna: The heart is the
best place. Meditate on Him in your heart.
