### CHAPTER V

### DAY ON THE RIVER WITH KESHAB CHUNDER SEN <span id="fr_35"></span>[\*](#fn_35.md)

i

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> was the day of the festival of
Lakshmi. <span id="fr_36"></span>[†](#fn_36.md) Srî Râmakrishna was seated
in His room talking with Bijoy and Haralal, when a gentleman entered and
announced that Keshab Sen had

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

<span class="margnote">Râmakrishna goes on board the steamer.</span>come
on board a steamer which had just landed and was lying at anchor before
the Ghât. A short while after Keshab's disciples came in and bowed down
before the Bhagavân, saying: "Keshab Bâbu has sent us to Thee with the
request that Thou wilt kindly join him, if it so please Thy Holiness."
Srî Râmakrishna consented and, accompanied by several of His devotees,
was taken by Keshab's disciples to the steamer.

<span class="margnote">Râmakrishna's ecstasy.</span>As the small boat
which carried the Bhagavân came alongside, everybody was eager to have a
glimpse of the Blessed One and crowded to the gangway. Keshab was
anxious to see that He got on board in safety. Mahendra, <span
id="fr_37"></span>[\*](#fn_37.md) who had been there for some time, looked
at Him and noticed that He was in Samâdhi and as motionless as a statue.
It was with great difficulty that He was brought back to
sense-consciousness once more in order to be taken into the cabin on the
upper deck. The state of Divine ecstasy had not entirely left Him even
then. He leaned on a disciple as He was led to the cabin. His body moved

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

mechanically, but His mind was fixed on God. When He had entered the
cabin, Keshab and others bowed at His feet. But what little
sense-consciousness remained now began to leave Him. Inside the cabin
were a bench, a table and a few chairs. The Bhagavân was seated on one
of the chairs; Keshab also took a chair and Bijoy, another. Other
devotees, most of them Brâhmos, sat on the bare floor. The cabin being a
small one, many remained standing at the door or at the windows looking
in eagerly. The Bhagavân was absolutely devoid of outer consciousness.
Everybody was watching His face. Keshab noticed that so large a number
of people had come together in the cabin that the Bhagavân was in need
of air. The devotees all gazed with fixed eyes. After a time the
Bhagavân came down from His Samâdhi, but the consciousness of the Divine
Presence was as intense as before. He talked to the Mother of the
universe in words that were scarcely articulate, saying: "O Mother, why
hast Thou brought me here? They are hedged around and are not free! Is
it indeed possible for me to save them out of their prison house?"

A Brâhmo said to the Bhagavân: Sir, these

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="margnote">Powhâri Bâbâ of Gâzipur.</span>gentlemen have
been fortunate enough to see  Powhâri Bâbâ <span
id="fr_38"></span>[\*](#fn_38.md) at Gâzipur. The bâbâ is another holy man
like Thy revered self.

Srî Râmakrishna had not yet recovered the power of speech. His heart was
full and He could not speak, but only smiled on the good man who talked
of the Bâbâ. The Brâhmo continued: Sir, Powhâri Bâbâ has Thy photograph,
which he has put up in his room.

<span class="margnote">Devotee's heart the temple of the lord.</span>The
Bhagavân smiled again, pointing to His body with His finger and in a
subdued tone said: A pillow-case! It is nothing but a pillow-case. But
there is one thing to be borne in mind: the heart of the devotee is the
temple of the Lord. It is indeed a fact that the Lord is more or less
manifest in all things, but He is manifest in a special sense in the
heart of a devotee (Bhakta). Thus a Zemindar may be met at any of the
houses of which he is the owner;

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

yet people will say that he is usually to be seen in some particular
drawing-room. The heart of the devotee is the Lord's drawing-room. If
one wishes to meet the Lord, one would better seek an audience in the
drawing-room.

<span class="margnote">Various aspects of the Brahman.</span>The same
Being whom the followers of non-dualistic (Advaita) Vedânta call
Brahman, the Absolute, is called Âtman (Self) by the Yogis, and
Bhagavân, or the Personal God with Divine attributes, by the devotees,
or Bhaktas (lovers of God). The high-caste Brâhmin is always the same
person; but when he worships the Lord, he is called a priest; and when
the same man is employed in the kitchen, he is called a cook.

<span class="margnote">Discrimination of an Advaitin.</span>The follower
of monistic (Advaita) Vedânta, who seeks to realize the Absolute
Brahman, discriminates, saying: "Not this, not this." That is, the
Absolute is not this, not that, not any finite object, not the
individual soul, not the external world. When, as the result of this
kind of reasoning, the heart ceases to be moved by desires; when, in
fact, the mind is merged in superconsciousness, then Brâhma-jnâna is
reached. One who has truly attained to this. Brâhma-jnâna realizes that
Brahman the Absolute alone is real, and the

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

world is unreal, and that all names and forms are like dreams. What
Brahman is cannot be described by word of mouth nor can one even say
that He is personal. Such is the point of view of a non-dualist.

<span class="margnote">Bhakta's attitude.</span>The dualistic devotees
and lovers of the Personal God (Bhaktas), on the contrary, accept all
states as real. Unlike the non-dualists, they look upon the waking state
as a reality and they do not hold that the external world is like a
dream. They say that the external world is the glory of the Lord. The
heavens, stars, moon, mountains, ocean, men, birds and beasts, all these
He has created. He manifests His glory by these. He is both within and
without. He dwells in our hearts. The most advanced Bhaktas say that the
Lord Himself manifests as the twenty-four categories of the Sânkhya
philosophy, that He appears as the individual soul and the external
world. A Bhakta wishes to enjoy communion with his Lord and not to
become one with Him. His desire is not to become sugar, but to taste of
it. <span class="margnote">The innermost feelings of a true
Bhakta.</span>Do you know what are the innermost thoughts and feelings
of a true devotee? He says: "O Lord! Thou art the Master, I am Thy
servant.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span class="margnote">Raja Yogi.</span><span
class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thou art my Mother, and
I am Thy child"; or again: "Thou art my Child and I am Thy father or Thy
mother"; or thus: "Thou art the Whole and I am Thy part." The dualistic
devotee does not wish to say, "I am Brahman." A Râja Yogi also seeks to
realize the Universal Being. His object is to bring the finite human
soul into communion with the infinite Spirit. He tries first to collect
his mind which is scattered in the world of senses, and then seeks to
fix it on the Universal Spirit; hence the necessity of meditating on Him
in solitude and in a posture which causes no distraction.

<span class="margnote">Different aspects of God.</span>But all these
various ideals are of one and the same Brahman, the difference being
only in the names. It is the same Being whom men call by the name of the
Absolute (Brahman), the Universal Spirit, the Impersonal God, or the
Personal God with Divine attributes.

The steamer had already started and was on its way to Calcutta. Many
there were who looked on Srî Râmakrishna with eyes that did not move,
and who drank the nectar of the words

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

that dropped from His hallowed lips. They did not perceive that the
steamer was in motion. The Temple garden of Kâli had faded from sight.
Beneath were the sacred waters which reflected the blue firmament above,
but the murmur of the waves fell unheeded on the ears of the devotees.
The magic of the blessed vision had thrown a charm over them. They
beheld before them a wonderful Being, a God-in-Man and a Man-in-God,
with smiles playing on His sweet face, radiant with the joy of the Lord,
and with eyes enhanced in beauty by the collyrium of Divine Love. They
gazed as if spell-bound, on One who had given up the world and its
pleasures, on One intoxicated with the Love of the Lord and who looked
not for anything except the Lord.

<span class="margnote">The world as a dream.</span>Srî Râmakrishna: The
followers of Advaita Vedânta maintain that creation, preservation, and
dissolution, the individual ego, the external world, all these are
manifestations of the Eternal Energy (Sakti). They also say that when
these are properly analyzed, they appear as dreams, that the Absolute
Brahman alone is the Reality, and all else is unreal. Even eternal
Energy (Sakti) is like a dream, unreal; but you may analyze and
discriminate

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

<span class="margnote">The realm the Divine Energy.</span>of thousands
of times, you cannot transcend the realm of Divine Energy (Sakti) unless
you have reached the highest state of Samâdhi, superconsciousness. The
very thoughts like: "I am meditating," "I am thinking on the Absolute,"
are within the realm of Sakti. They are the manifested powers of that
Eternal Energy. Therefore the Absolute Brahman and the Eternal Energy
are inseparable and one. The existence of one implies that of the other;
as fire and its burning power. If you admit the existence of fire, how
can you deny its burning power? <span class="margnote">Relation between
Brahman and Sakti.</span>No one can think of fire without thinking of
its burning power. Again, the power of burning cannot be conceived as
separate from fire. In the same manner, we cannot think of the rays of
the sun, without thinking of the sun himself. Again, we cannot think of
the sun without thinking of his rays. Therefore, no one can think of
Brahman as apart from Sakti, or Sakti as separate from Brahman.
Likewise, no one can conceive of the phenomenal as independent of the
Absolute, or of the Absolute as apart from the phenomenal. The same
Eternal Energy, the Mother of all phenomena, is creating, preserving,
and

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

destroying everything. She is called Kâli, the Divine Mother. Kâli is
Brahman, Brahman is Kâli, one and the same Being. I call Him Brahman
when He is absolutely inactive; that is, when He neither creates, nor
preserves, nor destroys phenomena; but when He performs all such
actions, I call Him Kâli, the Eternal Energy, the Divine Mother. They
are one and the same Being, the difference is in name and form, just as
the same substance water is called by different names in different
languages, such as jal, aqua, pâni, etc. <span class="margnote">One God
has many names.</span>Yes, the Being is the same, only the names are
different under different aspects—like the same sub- stance expressed in
different languages, such as jal, water and pâni. A tank may have four
Ghâts (landing-places with steps). The Hindus drink at one Ghât and call
it jal; the Mohammedans drink at another and call it pâni; while the
English who drink at a third call it water. Similarly, God is One, only
His names are different. Some call Him by the name of Allah, some God,
some Brahman, others Kâli, others again Râma, Hari, Jesus, Buddha.

Keshab, smiling: Please tell us once more, Revered Sir, in what
different ways Kâli, the

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mother of the
Universe, is making Herself manifest in this world of Her sports.

<span class="margnote">The Mother of the universe and Her
sports.</span>Srî Râmakrishna, smiling: Oh, the Mother sports with the
world, Her toy, under various aspects and names. Now She is the God
Unconditioned, Absolute, Formless (Mahâ-Kâli): now the Everlasting as
distinguished from Her works (Nitya-Kâli). Under another aspect She is
the Goddess of burning Ghâts or crematories, the dreaded Being who
presides over death (Smasân-Kâli); now again does She stand before us
ready to bless, to preserve Her children (Rakshyâ-Kâli); under another
aspect She appears pleasing to the eye of Her devotees as the Mother
with the dark blue color, Consort of the God of Eternity and Infinity.
Mahâ-Kâli and Nitya-Kâli are described in the sacred books, the Tantras:
"When nothing was—neither sun, nor moon, nor planets, nothing but
Darkness Deep, there was alone my Divine Mother, Formless, the Eternal
Consort of the Infinite." As Mother with the dark blue color (Syâmâ),
She is tender and loving. She is the bestower of all blessings and makes
Her children fearless; She is worshipped in the Hindu household. As
Preserver She appears in times of plague, famine, earthquake,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

drought or flood. At cemeteries, burning Ghâts or crematories She
appears in the form of the Destroyer. The dead body, the jackal, the
spirits of destruction are Her terrible companions. She lives in the
midst of those horrible scenes, of those fearful environments. Streams
of blood, a garland of skulls thrown round Her neck, a girdle made of
the hands of those that are dead, are the symbols that mark Her as the
dread Mother, as the All-Destroyer.

<span class="margnote">Creation of the world.</span>Now look at Her mode
of creation. At the end of a cycle, upon the destruction of the world,
my Mother, good Matron that She is, puts together the seeds of creation.
The mistress of a house has a hodgepodge pot of her own in which to keep
sundry things for household use. (Râmakrishna, smiling) Yes, my friends,
that is indeed so. The mistress of a house has such a pot in her
possession. In it are kept the "sea-foam" in a solid state, small
parcels containing seeds of the cucumber, gourd, and so on. She brings
them out when wanted. In much the same way my Mother keeps the seeds of
creation after the destruction of the world at the end of a cycle.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span class="margnote">Divine Mother omnipresent.</span>My Mother, the
Primal Divine Energy, is both within and without this phenomenal world.
Having given birth to the world, She lives within it. In the Vedas we
find the illustration of a spider and its web. <span
class="margnote">Divine Mother, the material and the instrumental
cause.</span>She is the spider and the world is the web that She has
woven. The spider brings the phenomenal web out of herself and then
lives on it. My Mother is both the Container and the Contained. Is Kâli,
the Divine Mother, black? She looks black from a distance, but when
realized, <span class="margnote">Kâli, why black?</span>She is not
black. The sky looks blue from a distance, but look at it near you, it
has no color. The water of the ocean is blue from a distance. Take a
little up in the hand, and it has no color. Saying this, the Bhagavân
became intoxicated with Divine Love, and began to sing:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"Is my Divine Mother black?  
   O mind! What dost thou say?  
 Though black, She with Her flowing hair  
   Illumines the lotus of the heart."

</div>

Bondage and freedom, of both She is the maker. Through Her inscrutable
power of

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

<span class="margnote">The Power of the Divine Mother.</span><span
class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mâyâ a man of the world
becomes bound by woman and gold. Again, through Her grace he becomes
free. She breaks all fetters and takes Her children across the ocean of
the world; and the Bhagavân sang in His divine voice:

<span class="smallcaps">The Divine Mother and the Liberated Soul</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. O Mother, Thou art flying the paper kite (of the human being) in the
market-place of this world.  
It flies on the wind of hope, tied to the string of Mâyâ.

2\. Ribs, nerves and bones make up its frame,  
Of Thine own qualities hast Thou made the Kite, to display Thine art.

3\. Thou hast rubbed the string with the Mânjâ (paste with powdered
glass) of worldliness, and it has become sharp.  
Among hundred thousand Kites one or two have their strings cut, and are
freed;  
Then with a laugh Thou clappest Thy hands.

4\. Prasâd says, The Kite thus set free will fly swiftly on fair winds
and drop beyond the ocean of this world.

</div>

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="margnote">Divine Mother's will.</span>Srî Râmakrishna
continuing: My Divine Mother is playful. The world indeed is Her sport.
She does what She will and is blissful. It is Her pleasure to give
freedom to one among a hundred thousand of Her children.

A Brâhmo: Sir, She can, if She pleases, set every body free. Why is it
then that She has bound us hand and foot with the chains of the world?

Srî Râmakrishna: Well, I suppose it is Her will. Her will is to play
with all these things. In the game of Hide-and-Seek, whoever touches the
Grand-dame is out. He no longer runs about. If all the players touch the
Grand-dame at the same time, how can there be any game? The Grand-dame
would not like it; for she is pleased to have the play go on.

And the Bhagavân, placing Himself in the position of a man of the world
laying the trouble of his heart before the Mother, sang:

<span class="smallcaps">The Divine Mother and Her Children</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

1\. This is the grief for which I grieve.  
When Thou, O Mother, art here, thieves (passions) rob me though I am
wide awake

</div>

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

2\. I promise to repeat Thy Holy Name, but at the proper hour I
forget.  
Now I have learnt and felt that all this is Thy trick.

3\. Thou hast not given, so Thou hast not received aught to eat or to
keep. Am I to be blamed for this?  
Hadst Thou given, Thou wouldst surely have received; and I would have
offered Thy gifts to Thee.

4\. Fame or calumny, sweet or bitter—all is Thine.  
O Ruler of all feelings, abiding in them, why dost Thou hinder when I
enjoy sweet ecstasy?

5 Prasâd says: Thou hast given me a mind, but by a glance of Thine eye
Thou hast so bent it, that I roam through this world, Thy creation,
seeking joy but mistaking bitter for sweet (unreal for Real).

</div>

<span class="margnote">Delusive power of Mâyâ.</span>Man has forgotten
his true Self and has become worldly by the delusive power of Mâyâ.
Therefore Prasâd says: "Thou hast given me a mind, but by a glance of
Thine eye Thou hast so bent it that

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I roam through
this world, Thy creation, seeking joy but mistaking bitter for sweet."

A Brâhmo: Revered Sir, is it true that God cannot be realized without
giving up the world?

<span class="margnote">Renunciation not necessary for all.</span>The
Bhagavân, smiling: Oh no! You do not have to give up everything. You are
better off where you are. By living in the world you are enjoying the
taste both of the pure crystallized sugar and of the molasses with all
its impurities. You are indeed better off. Verily I say unto you, you
are living in the world, there is no harm in that; but you will have to
fix your mind on God, otherwise you cannot realize Him. Work with one
hand and hold the Feet of the Lord with the other. When you have
finished your work, fold His feet to your heart with both your hands.

<span class="margnote">Power of the mind.</span>Everything is in the
mind. Bondage and freedom are in the mind. You can dye the mind with any
color you wish. It is like a piece of clean white linen; dip it in red
and it will be red, in blue it will be blue, in green it will be green,
or any other color. Do you not see that if you study English, English
words will come readily to you? Again,

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

if a Pandit studies Sanskrit, he will readily quote verses from Sacred
Books. If you keep your mind in evil company, your thoughts, ideas and
words will be colored with evil; but keep in the company of Bhaktas,
then your thoughts, ideas and words will be of God. The mind is
everything. On one side is the wife, on the other side is the child; it
loves the wife in one way and the child in another way, yet the mind is
the same.

By the mind one is bound; by the mind one is freed. If I think I am
absolutely free, whether I live in the world or in the forest, where is
my bondage? I am the child of God, the son of the King of kings; who can
bind me? When bitten by a snake, if you assert with firmness, "There is
no venom in me," you will be cured. In the same way, he who asserts with
strong conviction "I am not bound, I am free," becomes free.

<span class="margnote">Sense of sin.</span>Some one gave me a book of
the Christians. I asked him to read it to me. In it there was only one
theme—sin and sin, from the beginning to the end. (To Keshab) In your
Brâhmo-Samâj the main topic is also sin. The fool who repeats again and
again, "I am bound, I am bound," remains in bondage.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He who repeats day
and night, "I am a sinner, I am a sinner," becomes a sinner indeed.

<span class="margnote">Saving power of God's name.</span>It is necessary
to have absolute faith in the Name of the Lord. "What! I have uttered
His Holy Name, can there still be sin in me? Can I still be in bondage?"
Kristo Kishore was a pious Hindu, a Brâhmin of Brâhmins, who worshipped
the Lord with single-minded devotion. He went to Vrindâvan. One day,
while visiting the shrines, he felt very thirsty. He went to a well, and
finding a man standing there, he asked him: "My man, can you draw some
water for me?" The man replied: "O holy sir, I belong to a low class,
that of a cobbler." Kristo Kishore thereupon said to him: "It matters
not. You say 'Shiva' (the Holy Name of the Lord) and draw the water for
me."

By repeating the blessed Name of God, man's body, mind and soul become
absolutely pure. Why talk of sin and hell-fire? Repeat but once, "I
shall never again do the evil deeds that I have committed in the past,"
and by thy faith in His Hallowed Name thou shalt be freed from all sins.

I used to pray to my Divine Mother for true

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

<span class="margnote">Prayer to the Divine Mother.</span>devotion
(Bhakti) alone. With flowers in my clasped hands, I prayed: "Do Thou, O
Mother, grant that I may have pure and unalloyed devotion. Here is sin,
here again is virtue; I lay them at Thy feet; Oh take them both. Here is
knowledge (of many things), here again is ignorance; Oh take them both
and grant that I may have devotion alone. Here is purity and here again
is impurity; I desire neither of them. Here are good works, here are
bad; both I lay at Thy feet; Oh grant that I may have devotion alone and
love for Thee."

<span class="margnote">Example of Janaka.</span>One living in the world
may also see God. It was the case with Râjâ Janaka, the great royal
devotee, who realized while on the throne that the world was a structure
of dreams. For a lover of God, however, such is not the feeling. And the
Bhagavân sang:

He who has attained to Bhakti or true devotion to the Lord says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"This world is the abode of happiness;  
   I eat, drink and enjoy its pleasures.  
 Janaka Râjâ was a great potentate;  
   In what was he lacking?  
 He harmonized God and the world  
   And tasted the joys of both."

</div>

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

<span class="margnote">Value of solitude.</span>No one can suddenly
become like Janaka. Râjâ Janaka performed great penances and austerities
in solitude for many long years. Even when living in the world one
should occasionally go into solitude. It will bring great good to one
who can sincerely and earnestly cry for God three days and three nights
in solitude, alone. Indeed, one day passed in that way would be a great
gain. People will shed a jarful of tears for wives and children, but who
weeps one tear for the Lord? It is necessary to practise every now and
then devotional exercises in solitude. A worldly-minded aspirant
absorbed in various works and duties finds in the first stage of his
spiritual life a great number of obstacles in the path of self-control
and devotion. As a young tree planted on the foot-path needs a fence
around it that it may not be eaten up by sheep and cattle, so in the
first stage of a spiritual aspirant, a fence is necessary, but when the
tree grows large and the trunk and roots are thicker and stronger. no
fence is required. Then it is not injured even if an elephant be tied to
it.

The disease of a worldly man is of a serious type; his organs with their
functions are entirely out of order. Would you keep a large

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="margnote">Solitude a remedy for
Worldliness.</span>water-jar and savory pickles in the same room in
which a patient with typhoid fever was lying? If you wish to cure such a
patient, you must have him removed from that room, in case it is
impossible to send away the jar and the pickles. A man of the world is
like unto such a thirsty patient; worldly attractions are like the jar
of water; sense objects are like the savory pickles; desire to enjoy
those things is the patient's thirst. The mouth waters at the mere
thought of the pickles. We should not therefore remain near them all the
time. Hence solitude is the best remedy for worldliness. First acquire
right discrimination and true dispassion and then live in the world. In
the sea of the world there are crocodiles of passions and desires. Rub
the body with *turmeric-paste* if you wish to bathe in the sea, for then
crocodiles will do no harm to you. The turmeric is discrimination (of
the Real from the unreal) and true dispassion. God is the only Reality,
the phenomenal universe is unreal.

Along with this another thing is needed, that is intense devotion to
God. The Gopis <span id="fr_39"></span>[\*](#fn_39.md) of

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

<span class="margnote">Intense devotion necessary.</span><span
class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vrindâvan had such
devotion. They had an intense love for Srî Krishna, God Incarnate.

The Bhagavân then said to Keshab and other devotees with great feeling:
You are Brâhmos; you believe that God is formless and you do not believe
in God Incarnate. Well, it matters not. You need not accept Râdhâ and
Srî Krishna as Incarnations of the Supreme Being; hut the intense love
and yearning which the Gopis felt for Srî Krishna is a thing which you
may well make your own, for yearning is the next step leading to
God-vision.

It was ebb-tide. The steamer was going fast down-stream towards
Calcutta. It had got to the other side of the Howrah Bridge within sight
of the Botanical Gardens. The Captain had orders to go a little farther
down. How

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

far the steamer had actually proceeded was not known to those who were
listening to Srî Râmakrishna and watching His movements. They listened
with such rapt attention that they had no idea either of time or of
distance.

Keshab now offered the Bhagavân puffed rice with the kernel of the
cocoanut. All present were invited to partake of these. They took them
in the folds of their cloth, ate and were very happy. It seemed as if a
festival were being held on board the steamer. The Bhagavân noticed that
Bijoy and Keshab were not quite at home in each other's pretence. He
wished to see them make up their difference, for was not His mission to
bring peace and goodwill among men? He said to Keshab:

Look, my dear sir, here is Bijoy. As to your quarrels, well, do not
worry yourselves on their account. There was fighting even between Shiva
and Râma. Shiva was Râma's spiritual Guru. After a little fighting, they
made it up and became once more as good friends as ever. But the
fighting went on among their followers. The gibbering of the ghosts and
the chattering of the monkeys could not so easily be quieted down. You
too will be very good friends, once again. But your followers,

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I dare say, will
follow your example. These differences, you know, are things that.
cannot be avoided. There was the tug of war even between father and son.
Take the case of Râma and his sons Laba and Kusha. Take another case:
The mother fasts on Tuesday for the welfare of her daughter, but the
daughter, quarrelling with the mother, fasts on Tuesday for her own
welfare, as if her welfare were different from that gained by her
mother's fasting. In the same way, you, Keshab, have a religious society
(Samâj) of your own, and Bijoy, too, must have a separate society of his
own. Well, there is room for all kinds of things under Providence—even
for quarrels and differences. When God-Incarnate (Krishna) Himself
appeared at Vrindâvan, the question may well be asked: Why did Jatilla
and Kutilla stand in the way of His mission of love? I suppose His sport
as a Divine Lover would have died a natural death from want of
nourishment but for these obstructions, the *Jatillas* and *Kutillas*.
Opposition adds zest to a thing. Râmânuja <span
id="fr_40"></span>[\*](#fn_40.md) held the doctrine of Vishishtâdvaita
(qualified non-dualism). His Guru (spiritual guide), however,

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

was an Advaitist (non-dualist without any qualification). They had their
differences. Master and disciple disputed and refuted each other's
opinions. This is natural. Be it so; still to the master the disciple is
always his own.

<span class="margnote">The nature of disciples must be
examined.</span>They all rejoiced. Srî Râmakrishna said to Keshab: You
do not study and examine the nature of your disciples. For that reason
they drop away. All men look alike, but they differ in their nature. In
some the Sattwa quality is predominant, in others Rajas, and in the rest
Tamas. *Pooli* (cakes) all look alike on the outside, but the contents
vary; some may contain sweet thickened cream, others cocoanut sweetened
with sugar, while others may have boiled *Kalai* (pulse) with no
sweetening.

<span class="margnote">God the one master.</span>Do you know how I feel
about it? Like a child I eat, drink and play, depending on my Divine
Mother, who knows everything. These three words prick me: Guru
(spiritual master), Kartâ (the Lord), and Bâbâ (father). I cannot bear
them. The infinite Existence-Intelligence-Bliss is the one Guru for all.
He will teach everybody. I am only His child.

It is a difficult task to teach others. One

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

<span class="margnote">Who is a true spiritual teacher?</span>can become
a true spiritual teacher only when one has realized God and received a
Divine commission from Him. So commissioned were Nârada, <span
id="fr_41"></span>[\*](#fn_41.md) Sukadeva and Sankarâchârya: <span
id="fr_42"></span>[†](#fn_42.md) If you are not commissioned, who will
listen to you? You know Calcutta and her fondness for the latest
sensation. Milk puffs up so long as it is over burning wood; but when
the wood is withdrawn, the puffing ceases instantly. The people of
Calcutta are fond of new sensations. They say they want water and they
begin to dig a well at one place; but they give it up as soon as they
find that the earth is hard and stony. They then set to work to dig at
another place. Suppose the soil is sandy there; they will as readily
give up digging at that spot. They will look about for another locality.
That is the way with these people. Their good opinion is by no means
worth having.

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

<span class="margnote">Divine commission.</span>Divine commission cannot
be obtained by mere imagination. Verily I say, the Lord can be realized
and He will speak to thee. Then thou mayest receive His commission. What
great power lies in such Divine command! By it mountains may be shaken
to their foundation. What can a mere ordinary lecture do? People may
listen to it for a time, but they will soon forget it. It will not
produce a lasting impression and they will not live according to it.

<span class="margnote">Ordinary spiritual teachers are blind.</span>For
the teaching of Divine truths a badge of authority is indispensable. A
man who tries to teach others without it will be laughed at. He cannot
get realization himself and he tries to show the way to others. It is
like the blind leading the blind. In this way more harm is done than
good. When God is realized the inner spiritual sight opens and it is
then that the true teacher can perceive the sickness of the soul and can
prescribe the proper remedy. Without God's command a man easily becomes
egotistic and thinks, "I have the power to teach others." Such egotism
is the result of ignorance. In ignorance one feels, "I am the doer;" but
when one realizes that "God is the Lord and doer of all, I cannot

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

do anything," then one becomes absolutely free even in this life. All
misery and restlessness proceed from the sense of "I" and "me," "I am
the doer," "I am the actor."

You talk glibly of doing good to the world.

<span class="margnote">First see God, then help the world.</span>Is the
world contained in a nutshell? Besides, who are you to do good to the
world? First practice devotional exercises and realize God. Attain to
Him. If He graciously gives you His powers (Sakti), then you can help
others, and not till then.

A Brâhmo devotee: Revered Sir, are we to give up all works until we have
seen God?

Srî Râmakrishna: No, why will you give up all works? Meditation upon
God, chanting His Holy Name, and other devotional exercises are daily
works which you should have to perform.

The devotee: But what about household works and business affairs?

<span class="margnote">Pray that worldly work may grow less.</span>Srî
Râmakrishna: Oh! you will also perform those, but only so far as is
absolutely necessary for living in the world; and you should at the same
time pray in solitude unto the Lord with tears in your eyes for His
grace, and for strength to do your duties without seeking any reward.
Say when you pray: "Lord, grant that my work in

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

the world and for the world may grow less and less day by day, for I see
that my work growing manifold only makes me lose sight of Thee.
Sometimes I think that I do my duties unattached to the world, but I
know not how I deceive myself and do them through attachment instead. I
give alms to the poor, and behold, I seek for fame, Oh I know not how!"

Shambhu (Mullik) <span id="fr_43"></span>[\*](#fn_43.md) talked of founding
hospitals and dispensaries, schools and colleges, of God-vision and
building roads, sinking wells and philanthropic digging tanks for the
good of all. I works. said to him: "Yes, whatever comes in your way and
is absolutely necessary you will do; even that, without seeking any
reward. Do not seek more work than you can well perform. If you do you
will forget the Lord. A man desired to see the shrine of the Divine
Mother. On his way he stopped and spent all

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

the day in distributing alms to the poor. When he went to the shrine,
the door was closed and he could not see the Holy of Holies. The wise
ones should first see the Holy Mother, by pushing their way through the
crowd assembled at the gate of the Temple, and after seeing Her, they
may then turn their attention to alms-giving and other good works, if
they so desire." All good works are for the realization of God. Works
are the means and God-vision is the end.

<span class="margnote">God-vision the end of all performance of
duty.</span>Therefore I said to Shambhu: "Suppose you see God, or that
God manifests Himself to you, will you say to Him: 'Lord, do Thou grant
that I may have lots of dispensaries and hospitals, schools and
colleges!'" A true devotee shall rather pray in this wise: "Grant, O
good Lord, that I may have a niche in the Lotus of Thy Feet, that it may
be my privilege to live always in Thy Holy Presence and that I may have
deep and unalloyed devotion unto Thee."

<span class="margnote">Path of Bhakti Yoga best for us in this
age.</span>Karma Yoga is very difficult. It is difficult in this
materialistic age (Kâli-yuga) to get through all the works, all the
duties laid upon by the Sacred Books. Verily this age, earthly life
depends entirely upon material food. Works and duties, there is

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

scarcely time enough for them. It will be all over with the patient
suffering from the burning fever of this world if he is allowed to go
through the slow process of treatment practised by the old-fashioned
Hindu physicians. People are short-lived and the malaria carries one off
in a few days. The specific for the present day is Dr. D. Gupta's patent
fever mixture, which produces a miraculous effect at once. Yes, in this
age the one means of realizing God is Bhakti or sincere devotion and
love for Him, and earnest prayer and the chanting of His Holy Name and
Divine attributes. (To Keshab and other devotees) Your path, too, lies
through devotion and self-surrender to the Lord (Bhakti Yoga). Blessed
are ye who sing the Name of Hari and chant the praises of my Divine
Mother. Your path is right. Unlike the non-dualists, you do not believe
that this world is only a dream. You are not Jnânis, but Bhaktas; you
believe in a Personal God, that is good. You are Bhaktas. If you can
sincerely and earnestly cry for Him, you will surely obtain Him.

(To Keshab) You talk against child marriage and the caste system, about
female emancipation and female education. I say one thing is
needful,—the realization of God and devotion

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

to Him. First realize God and all other things shall be added unto you.
Jadu Mullik is a rich man. If you wish to cultivate his acquaintance, do
not trouble yourself as to how much wealth he has, how many houses he
owns, how many country-houses and gardens. First, be introduced to him
and he will furnish you with all the necessary information afterwards.

<span class="margnote">Parable of the deserted temple.</span>There was a
young man named Podo in a certain village. In that village was an old
dilapidated temple. The holy image of God once worshipped there had
disappeared and it was now the home of small bats. One day at nightfall
the villagers were surprised to hear the sound of bells, gongs, and
conch-shells issuing from the deserted temple. Men, women and children
all flocked to the place. They thought that some devotee must be
worshipping some image of God newly set up within the temple by
performing the Ârati, the evening ceremony of waving the lights and
offering flowers, fruits and holy water. With folded hands they all
stood listening to the sacred sounds before the temple. One of them,
more curious than the rest, had the courage to go inside. To his
surprise he saw that Podo was ringing the bell and blowing

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

the shell; but the floor was as dirty as before with impurities of all
kinds and there was no image of God on the altar! He then called out,
saying: "O Podo, thou hast no Mâdhava (Srî Krishna, God-Incarnate) in
the temple; how is it, then, that thou hast raised all this clamor by
blowing the conch-shell? And behold! thou hast not even taken the
trouble to cleanse the temple by removing the impurities and dirt of
years and washing the floor with the holy water of the Ganges!"

<span class="margnote">First cleanse the heart.</span>First realize God
in the temple of your heart. With that in view, you must cleanse it of
all impurities, all sin and iniquity, all attachment to the world caused
by the power of the senses. It is then that the time comes for blowing
the shell, if need be. Talk of social reforms! You may well do so after
realizing God. Remember, the Rishis of old gave up the world in order to
attain to God. This is the one thing needful. All other things shall be
granted unto you.

The steamer had come back to Koylâghât (Calcutta). All on board held
themselves in readiness to land. As they came out of the

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

cabin they saw that the full moon had bathed the bosom of the Holy
Ganges and the adjoining banks with her mellow light. The Bhagavân with
two or three disciples got into a cab which had been kept waiting for
Him on the shore. Nandalâl, Keshab's nephew, also got in. He wished to
go with the Bhagavân for some distance. When all had seated themselves
in the cab, Srî Râmakrishna asked: "Where is Keshab?" In a few moments
Keshab came up smiling and inquired who were going with Him. Being
satisfied with the answer, he bowed down to the ground before the
Bhagavân, who affectionately bade him adieu.

The cab set out. The Bhagavân was filled with supreme joy as the
carriage drove along. Suddenly He said: "I am thirsty; what is to be
done?" Nandalâl stopped the carriage before the gates of the India Club
and went upstairs to bring water. It was brought in a glass tumbler. The
Bhagavân, smiling, asked, "Is the glass well washed?" Nandalâl replied,
"Yes." The Bhagavân drank the water. He was childlike in His simplicity.
He put forward His face to look at the various objects on both sides.
His joy knew no bounds as He saw men, animals, carriages, houses, the
moonlight, the lighted streets!

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

Nandalâl got out at Colutolâ. The cab came to a stop before the door of
Suresh Mitra's <span id="fr_44"></span>[\*](#fn_44.md) house. Suresh was
very much attached to the Bhagavân, but he was not at home. He had gone
to visit a newly-purchased garden at Kânkurgâchi. His people opened a
room on the ground floor and invited the party to be seated there. The
cab-fare was to be paid. Who was there to pay it? Had Suresh been at
home, he would have done so. The Bhagavân said to a disciple: "Ask the
ladies of the house for the fare. I suppose they know well enough that
their husbands are in the habit of coming to our place."

Narendra (Vivekânanda) lived in the same neighborhood, so the Bhagavân
sent for him. Meanwhile the inmates of the house led Him upstairs into
the drawing-room. The matting of the floor was covered with a carpet and
a white sheet. Three or four pillows were lying about. On the walls
there hung a beautiful oil-painting which Suresh intended to be a
representation of the harmony of all religions.

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In the painting
Srî Râmakrishna was represented as pointing to Keshab that all religions
lead to one goal—be it Hinduism, Mahometanism, Buddhism, Christianity,
or their various sects.

The Bhagavân was conversing with smiles on His lips when Narendra carne
up. His joy redoubled. He said to Narendra as He talked: We enjoyed such
a pleasant trip on board the steamer with Keshab Sen. Bijoy also was
there, and many of those present here. You may ask Mahendra how I talked
to Keshab and Bijoy about the mother and her daughter both observing
fast on Tuesday each for her own welfare, and how God's Sports in this
world would suffer for want of nourishment in the absence of
obstructions like Jatilla and Kutilla.

It was getting late. But Suresh had not come home as yet. The Bhagavân
asked to go back to the Temple at Dakshineswara. It was about half-past
ten and He wished to leave for the garden. The streets were flooded with
moonlight. The cab was at the door. The Bhagavân got in. Narendra and
Mahendra bowed low to the Master and started for their homes.
