God is Infinite. Infinite are the Forms in which He manifests Himself.
Infinite also are the ways leading to Him.--p. 312

Sri Ramakrishna, (1836-1886) was a Bengali mystic who had a huge impact
on the development of modern Hinduism. His chief disciple, Swami
Vivekananda, not only helped revive Hinduism in India, but also
introduced Hinduism to the West. Ramakrishna was a non-dualist
worshippper of the Goddess Kali. However, he also experimented with
Christianity and Islam, and repeatedly preached the diversity of paths
to God.

This is the story of Ramakrishna told first-hand as a series of days and
nights spent with his disciples and lay followers. Imagine someone
following Buddha or Jesus around with a steno pad and then publishing
candid transcripts of their notes. This is the Victorian-era equivalent.
We watch Ramakrishna go into his trances, sing devotional songs, and
dispense parables. We get to listen into his profound discourses,
including lucid descriptions of very high-level yogic techniques. This
is a unique look at a holy man.--J.B. Hare

Production notes: this is a completely new scan of different, and
earlier translation of this work than the edition previously seen
elsewhere on the web, translated by Swami Nikhilananda. The author
listed as "M" was apparently Mahendra Nath Gupta (1855-1932), who
transcribed the notes into a five volume Bengali edition, and later
translated them into English. The English translations of the Gospel of
Ramakrishna, this one included, are derived from his work.
