### INTRODUCTION

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Lord declares:—

"Whenever true religion declines and irreligion prevails, I manifest
myself and in every age I incarnate to establish spiritual law and to
destroy evil."—*Bhagavad Gitâ*.

 

<span class="margnote">Saviours.</span>India has produced many great
spiritual leaders who are recognized and worshipped as Saviours of
mankind. The life and character of each of these were as wonderful,
superhuman, and divine as were those of the illustrious Son of Man. Each
has been like the embodiment of all Divine attributes; each has been the
giver of new life to the old spiritual truths, and the generator of that
tidal wave of spirituality which has again and again inundated the
religious world, surmounting the

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

barriers of superstition and prejudice and carrying the stream of
individual souls toward the ocean of Divinity.

The present upheaval of the spiritual tide, the waves of which,
traversing nearly half the world, have touched the shores of America,
was produced by the Christlike character and Divine personality of
Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna—revered and worshipped in India to-day as an
ideal manifestation of the Divine glory. His life was so extraordinary
and unparalleled that within ten years after His departure from earth it
aroused the admiration, wonder and reverence not only of all classes of
people in His own country, but of many distinguished English and German
scholars of the nineteenth century.

<span class="margnote">Life of Srî Râmakrishna by European
Scholars.</span>A short account of the life of Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna
appeared for the first time in the January number of the "Imperial and
Quarterly Review" of 1896 under the title of "A Modern Hindu Saint." It
was an able article penned by Prof. C. H. Tawney, who was for many years
the professor of Sanskrit in Calcutta University and the distinguished
Librarian of India House in London. This article excited the interest of
many

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> European scholars,
among whom Professor Max Muller showed his appreciation by publishing in
the August number of the "Nineteenth Century" of 1896 a short sketch of
this Hindu Saint's life entitled "A Real Mahâtman." In this celebrated
article, which was for some time the subject of most severe criticism
both in England and India among many of the Christian missionaries and
the Theosophists, the noted Professor showed the difference between the
imaginary Mahâtmas of the Theosophists and the Real Mahâtman or the
Great Soul of India who had reached God-consciousness and had manifested
Divinity in all the actions of His daily life. He gave a brief account
of the extraordinary life of Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna, paying Him the
highest tribute of honor and respect that a Christian scholar could give
to a Divine manifestation in the so-called heathen land. Later, in 1898,
he compiled and published "Râmakrishna, His Life and Sayings,"
collecting more facts of His life and the sayings of this exemplary
character perfumed with Divine personality.

Professor Max Muller was deeply impressed by the originality of this
great Saint and real Mahâtman, who was not brought up within the

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="margnote">Râmakrishna a real Mahâtman.</span>precincts of
any university and who drew the water of His wisdom neither from any
book nor Scripture nor from any ancient prophet but directly from the
eternal Fountainhead of all Knowledge and Wisdom. He was also struck by
the broad, liberal and absolutely unsectarian spirit which pervades the
utterings of Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna. Indeed the life and savings of
the Bhagavân have given a death-blow to the sectarian bigotry and
fanaticism of the so-called religious world. Whosoever has read His
Sayings is impressed with the universality of His spiritual ideals which
embraced the ideals of all mankind.

From His childhood Srî Râmakrishna fought against all sectarian
doctrines and dogmas, but yet at the same time He showed that all sects
and creeds were but the paths which lead sincere and earnest souls to
the one universal goal of all religions. Having realized the highest
ideal of every religion by following the methods and practices of the
various sects and creeds of the world, Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna gave to
humanity whatever spiritual experience and realization He had acquired.
Every idea which He gave was fresh from above and unadulterated

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

by the product of human intellect, culture or scholastic education. Each
step of His life from babyhood to the last moment was extraordinary.
Every stage was like the unfoldment of a chapter of a new scripture
especially written out by the Unseen Hand to fit the minds of the East
and the West and to fulfil the spiritual needs of the twentieth century.

Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna is not only the greatest saint of modern India
but He is the "Real Mahâtman." A real Mahâtman as described in the
Bhagavad Gitâ (Chapter VII, verse 19) is one who, having realized the
Absolute, perceives the Divine Being in all animate and inanimate
objects of the universe. His heart and soul never turn away from God. He
lives in God-consciousness, and Divine qualities constantly flow through
his soul. He cares neither for fame nor power nor worldly prosperity. A
true Mahâtman has no attachment to His body or to sense-pleasures; He is
a living God; He is absolutely free and His inner nature is illumined by
the self-effulgent light of Divine wisdom and His heart is overflowing
with Divine Love. His soul becomes the playground of the Almighty, His
body and mind become the instrument of the Divine will. And Bhagavân

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Srî Râmakrishna
was such a real Mahâtman.

Even in this age when the vast majority of educated people do not
believe in the existence of God and of the human soul, when scientific
knowledge has turned the minds of students away from the path of
spirituality, when sense pleasures and the luxuries of life have become
the ideals of earthly existence and human beings have degenerated into
money-making machines, we have witnessed with our eyes a Great Soul who
is recognized as a Real Mahâtman by hundreds and thousands of thoughtful
men and women of India, Europe and America. This Great Soul manifested
His Divine qualities and lived in God-consciousness at every moment of
His earthly career, and to-day thousands of people prostrate before His
picture and, worship Him as the latest manifestation of Divinity.
Whosoever has heard of His most wonderful life has felt in his soul that
Râmakrishna was the perfect Ideal of mankind.

He made His appearance in an obscure part of Bengal where He passed His
early boyhood, but His youth and maturity were spent near Calcutta, the
capital of British India, as cosmopolitan a city as London, New York,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

<span class="margnote">Râmakrishna's influence upon the mind of
Scholars.</span>or any other large city of the civilized world and the
seat of education, refinement and scientific knowledge. He allowed the
sceptical minds of the students and professors of colleges and
universities as well as of educated men and women of the world to come
in direct touch with the self-effulgent light of Divine wisdom which was
shining in its full glory through His childlike, soft, and tender form.
Scholars and intelligent people of all classes poured from every quarter
to that spot which was sanctified by the presence of the Bhagavân. He
was the living example of the spiritual greatness and Divinity which had
been manifested by the great Incarnations like Christ, Buddha, Krishna,
Râma, Chaitanya <span id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1.md) and other Saviours of
the world.

We know a number of sceptics and agnostics who had never believed in
Christ or Buddha or Krishna as Divine Incarnations, who had never
accepted the authority of the Scriptures, but on

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

the contrary had maintained that the lives of Christ and of other
Saviours were but exaggerated accounts based upon the imagination of
their disciples, anxious to deify their human masters—such sceptics and
unbelievers when they met Râmakrishna and watched His superhuman life,
were convinced that the lives of Christ, Buddha, Krishna, and other
Avatâras must have been true and real. The same sceptics, when they
beheld His Divine powers, were so deeply impressed with His personality
that they prostrated before Him, kissed the dust of His holy feet and
realized that He was the Personification of the Sermon on the Mount, the
Incarnation of Divinity on earth, and the remanifestation of Christ,
Buddha, Krishna, and Chaitanya in one form. All the special qualities
and Divine powers that had adorned the wonderful character of each of
these great personages were witnessed by them in this uncommon Divine
manifestation of the nineteenth century.

Have we not watched with admiration when the followers of all the great
religions of the world recognized in Srî Râmakrishna their Divine
Ideals? Have we not seen how Quakers and orthodox Christians knelt and
prayed before

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

<span class="margnote">Râmakrishna as the Divine  Ideal of all
Sects.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Him
and worshipped Him as the Christ when the Bhagavân went into
superconscious communion with the Heavenly Father after hearing the holy
name of Jesus of Nazareth? The Mahometan saints who came to see Him,
prostrated at His holy feet and recognized in Him the highest Ideal of
Islam. The Buddhists regarded Him as Sambuddha, the Enlightened. The
followers of Chaitanya, like Vaishnava Charan, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2.md) and others, worshipped Him as the second
Prophet of Nuddea when Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna occupied the altar which
was reverentially dedicated to Srî Chaitanya by hundreds of devoted
Vaishnavas, who always prostrated before that altar and prayed to their
Lord Guarânga. The worshippers of Krishna called Him the Incarnation of
Krishna. The devotees of the Divine Mother realized that the Mother of
the universe was playing through Him; the followers of Shiva declared
that Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna was their living Deity; while the Sikhs,
the faithful votaries of Guru Nânaka, <span id="fr_3"></span>[†](#fn_3.md)

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

regarded Him as their Holy Master. His followers, seeing all these
powers, marvelled at His greatness and believed that His many-sided
personality was the living example and the consummation of all the
previous Avatâras and Divine manifestations. And the truth of this was
again and again verified and confirmed by His acts as well as by His own
words: "He who was Krishna, Râma, Christ, Buddha, Chaitanya has *now*
become Râmakrishna." Bhagavân was always conscious of this truth and
spoke of it before the world as well as before His dearest disciples.

<span class="margnote">His mission.</span>As His Divine personality was
many-sided yet one, so was His great mission. It was to show the
underlying unity in the variety of religions and to establish that
universal religion of which sectarian religions are each but partial
expressions. Like all other Saviours the life of the Bhagavân
exemplified His mission. He spent the best part of His life in
practising in full the different

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

methods of Yoga. He went through every minute detail of the devotional
exercises and different forms of worship ordained by the Scriptures of
different nations and practised by the followers of the various sects
and creeds of the world. His object in devoting so much time to these
practices was to find out whether they had any real value in the path
which leads to perfection.

Râmakrishna's mind was always open to Truth. He would not accept
anything on second-hand authority. He would not believe in anything
because it was written in a book or because it was declared by some
great personage. He must know the Truth first hand. Before accepting any
statement, He must realize it in His own life and then He would speak of
His personal experience to others in order that they might gain benefit
from it. For nearly twelve years before He appeared in public or made
any disciples Srî Râmakrishna, like a scientific investigator, inquired
into the beliefs of the various sects of every religion, followed their
methods and performed their rituals and ceremonies with perfect faith
and earnest devotion that He might realize the goal which could be
reached by each of them. To His great

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

surprise, however, He discovered that He arrived at God-consciousness
through each sectarian method. Whenever, furthermore, He desired to
follow any particular path, there came to Him a perfected soul of each
sect who had realized the Ideal, to direct Him in that path. Everyone of
these great saints recognized in Srî Râmakrishna the manifestation of
Divine powers, when in a short time He attained to that which they had
not been able to acquire during years of austerity, worship and extreme
devotion.

Having finished His investigations, He was ready to proclaim His message
and give to the world the fruits of His own experience and realization.
But unlike other spiritual teachers, He did not go out in search after
His disciples and followers. As a fragrant flower does not hunt for bees
but waits patiently for the bees to come, so the full-blown flower of
spirituality in the form of Srî Râmakrishna waited for His disciples to
come to Him in the Temple garden at Dakshineswara on the bank of the
Ganges.

When Râmakrishna had attained to the highest ideal of each Yoga and had
realized the spiritual oneness with the Absolute Brahman and the Mother
of the universe, rumor spread from mouth to mouth that Râmakrishna had

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

reached perfection in this life. People from all quarters began to crowd
around Him. Pandits and scholars of every nationality as well as
hundreds of devout men and women of all sects came to see Him and listen
to His original and wonderful teachings. This was the beginning of His
public life as spiritual leader and guide, which continued for nearly
sixteen years. During this period He did nothing but help mankind by
freely distributing the priceless jewels of spiritual truths which he
had earned through such struggle, hardship and austerities.

<span class="margnote">His  spiritual insight.</span>Râmakrishna had a
marvellous intellect and keen insight into the true nature of things and
events, and using the commonest occurrences of every-day life as
illustrations, He succeeded in making the dull minds of worldly people
grasp the spiritual depth, beauty and grandeur of His sublime ideals. He
poured new life into every word that He uttered so as to touch the soul
of His hearers. People listened with wonder and admiration to His
original discourses on the most difficult problems concerning life and
death, the nature and origin of the soul, the origin of the universe and
our relation to God.

In this age of scientific rationalism Bhagavân

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

<span class="margnote">Realization of God.</span><span
class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Srî Râmakrishna has
shown to the world how the Lord of the universe can be realized and
attained in this life, and no one except Him has ventured to go through
all the tests of sceptics and agnostics to prove that He had attained to
God-consciousness. Those who have seen Him, lived with Him for years and
watched Him by day and by night, have proclaimed before the world that
He was the embodiment of the highest spiritual ideals of all nations,
and that whoever worships Him with faith and reverence worships the
latest manifestation of Divinity.

The Bhagavân proved by His example that wherever there is extreme
longing to see God, there is the nearness of the realization of the
absolute Truth. His life has given to the world a grand demonstration
that even in this age Divinity can be reached and Divine perfection can
be acquired by one who is pure, chaste, simple and whose devotion is
whole-hearted and whole-souled. We have neither seen nor heard of a
character purer, simpler, more chaste, more truthful and more godly than
that of this ideal Mahâtman. He was like the personification of purity
and chastity and the embodiment of truthfulness.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

His life was the life of absolute renunciation. Earthly pleasures and
comforts meant nothing to Him. The only pleasure, comfort or happiness
which He cared for was the blissful state of Samâdhi or
God-consciousness, when His soul, liberated from the bondage of body and
mind, soared high in the infinite space of the Absolute. This Samâdhi
was a natural state with Râmakrishna. He never had to make a special
effort to attain it. We often heard Him say that when He was four years
old He went into Samâdhi at the sight of the beautiful coloring of a
tropical cloud. This realization He always remembered and often
described in His conversation. And as He grew older His Samâdhi or
ecstasy became stronger and deeper.

<span class="margnote">His Samâdhi.</span>In His Samâdhi His body would
become absolutely motionless, His pulse and heart-beat imperceptible,
His eyes would be half open and if anyone pressed His eyeball with the
finger, His body would not move or show the least sign of sensation. He
would remain in this state sometimes for a few minutes, sometimes for
half an hour or an hour, and on one occasion He continued in it for
three days and nights. Then He would come down on the plane of
sense-consciousness and relate His

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

experiences. He had the power to separate Himself from the cage of the
physical organism and to go into this state of Divine communion at His
will and stay there as long as He wished. Frequently He told us that He
reached such a height in Samâdhi that if He had been like an ordinary
mortal He could never have returned to His body; that no mortal had ever
come back from that kind of Samâdhi; and that the Divine Mother gave Him
this power to return to this plane simply to help mankind and to
establish His mission.

<span class="margnote">His renunciation.</span>To Him God was father,
mother, brother, sister, and everything. He recognized no earthly
relations. He never coveted wealth, nor had He any earthly possession.
He realized that gold had no more value than earth and became absolutely
unattached to riches, understanding the transitoriness of the objects
which can be acquired by wealth. He often said that immortality could
not be purchased by money, and emphasized by His example the true
meaning of the Vedic passage: "Neither by meritorious deed, nor by
progeny, nor by wealth, but by renunciation alone the Immortal Truth can
be acquired." Renunciation of the attachment to worldly things is the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

gate to God-consciousness. Christ, Buddha, Chaitanya, Sankarâchârya and
all other Saviours and spiritual leaders of the world exemplified this
by living the life of absolute renunciation. It is very rare to find in
this age a perfect ideal of the renunciation of lust and of worldly
attachment. Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna practised the ideal of the
renunciation of riches to such an extent that He was able to make His
body respond involuntarily to the touch of coin by shrinking from it
even in sound sleep. We have often seen Him suffer pain when he was
obliged to touch a coin of any metal. Who could be a more perfect ideal
of renunciation in this age of materialism!

<span class="margnote">He uplifted womanhood.</span>Srî Râmakrishna
taught that every woman, old or young, was the representative of the
Divine Mother. He worshipped God as the Mother of the universe and
frequently declared that His Divine Mother had shown Him that all women
represent Divine Motherhood on earth. For the first time in the
religious history of the world was this ideal preached by any Divine
Incarnation. And upon this depends the salvation of men and especially
of women of all countries from immorality, corruption and such other
vices as prevail in a civilized community.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

By His living example the Bhagavân established the truth of spiritual
marriage on the soul plane even in this age of sensuality. He had a wife
whom He always treated with reverence and whom He regarded as the
manifestation of His Divine Mother. He never had any sex relation with
her or with any woman on the physical plane. His wife, the Blessed
Virgin Sâradâ Devi, is still living like an embodiment of Holy
Motherhood with innumerable spiritual children around Her. She in turn
has always regarded the Bhagavân as Her Blessed Mother Divine in a human
form. Up to the last moment of His earthly career the Bhagavân was
absolutely pure, chaste, and a perfect child of His Divine Mother of the
universe. Furthermore, Râmakrishna uplifted the ideal of womanhood on
the spiritual plane by accepting His first Guru or spiritual instructor
in a woman form. No other Saviour or spiritual leader has ever given
such an honor to womanhood in the annals of religious history.

<span class="margnote">His mission.</span>The mission of Bhagavân Srî
[Râmakrishna](errata.htm#1.md) was to show by His living example how a
truly spiritual man, being dead to the world of senses, can live on the
spiritual plane of God-consciousness; it was to prove

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

that each individual soul is immortal and potentially Divine. His
mission was to establish harmony between religious sects and creeds. For
the first time it was absolutely demonstrated by Râmakrishna that all
religions are like so many paths leading to the same Goal, that the
realization of the same Almighty Being is the highest Ideal of
Christianity, Mahometanism, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, as well
as of all other smaller religions of the world. Srî Râmakrishna's
mission was to proclaim the eternal Truth that God is one but has many
aspects, and that the same one is worshipped by different nations under
various names and forms; that He is personal, impersonal and beyond
both; that He is with name and form and yet nameless and formless. His
mission was to establish the worship of the Divine Mother and thus to
elevate the ideal of womanhood into Divine Motherhood. His mission was
to show by His own example that true spirituality can be transmitted and
that salvation can be obtained through the grace of a Divine
Incarnation. His mission was to declare before the world that psychic
powers and the power of healing are obstacles in the path of the
attainment of God-consciousness.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="margnote">His Divine powers.</span>Bhagavân Srî Râmakrishna
possessed all the Yoga powers but He seldom exercised those powers,
especially the power of healing diseases. Moreover, He always prevented
His disciples from either seeking or exercising those powers. But one
power which we have seen Him frequently exercise was the Divine power to
transform the character of a sinner and to lift a worldly soul to the
plane of superconsciousness by a single touch. He would take the sins of
others upon His own shoulders and would purify them by transmitting His
own spirituality and opening the spiritual eyes of His trite followers.

The days of prophecy have passed before our eyes. The manifestations of
the Divine powers of One who is worshipped to-day by thousands as the
latest Incarnation of Divinity, we have witnessed with our eyes. Blessed
are they who have seen Him and touched His holy feet. May the glory of
Srî Râmakrishna be felt by all nations of the earth; may His Divine
power be manifested in the earnest and sincere souls of His devotees of
all countries in all ages to come, is the prayer of His child and
servant,

<span class="smallcaps">Abhedânanda</span>.
