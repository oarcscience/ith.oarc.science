### REV. LEADBEATER OFF THE TRAIL

The harm to Yoga philosophy that has been done by misinformation thru
the "Theosophist" Rev. C. W. Leadbeater is indeed very great.

Most readers of Theosophical and Occult literature believe Rev.
Leadbeater to be a friend to the Hindus, but after reading his book,
"The Inner Life" and "The Chakras", I am forced to say by the
information he has given, he is the greatest enemy of Yoga philosophy,
and has given a bad name to Yoga. This may have been done unconsciously.
Nevertheless, it is hard to believe, as in "The Chakras" he in no
instance has corrected the misinformation made in "The Inner Life". For
example. in "The Chakras" he tries to prove a difference in the petals
of the different centers from that which is given in Yoga philosophy.

According to Rev. Leadbeater all the Yogis of the past and present, even
the founder of Yoga philosophy are wrong about the Chakras, and their
petals.

All Yogis and our books claim Sahasrara, has one thousand petals but in
one of his

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

chapters, Rev. Leadbeater says he found there were only Nine Hundred and
Sixty and not 'One Thousand'. The Ajna Chakra has two petals, according
to Yoga, but Rev. Leadbeater claims he found Ninety-six petals in the
Ajna Chakra. All his counts are opposite the Yogis' Chakras, except one.
He claims he found Nine Hundred and Sixty and
[Ninety-six](errata.htm#39.md).

Every Yogi cannot help but laugh, because there are really no petals at
all. I will explain here, the symbols these petals stand for.

Every Yogi knows, and the students of Yoga Philosophy know, that Rev.
Leadbeater is 'off the trail,' and did not stop to consider the origin
of our One Thousand Petals. but undoubtedly he had something else in
mind.

In Yoga Philosophy these Chakras are symbols; the first—Earth, the
second—Water. third-Fire, fourth—Air, fifth—Ether and sixth—Mental. The
'Thousand-Petaled' we do not call a Chakra, as it is above the nature
element and mind.

In these six symbols we have the 'Garland of Letters', as there are
fifty letters in the Sanskrit alphabet and each petal of these

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

centers represent a letter. In the first or Root Chakra, Yoga puts four
petals, six in the second, ten in the third, twelve in the fourth,
sixteen in the fifth and two in the sixth, between the eyes. That
includes the occult symbol of the Sanskrit alphabet. By
[repeating](errata.htm#40.md) all of the fifty alphabetical letters twenty
times we have One Thousand—the symbol of the 'Thousand-petals'. We would
like to know just where Rev. Leadbeater gets his idea that there are
only 960. Now is he not off the trail, reader?

Now I will give you his own words about awakening the Kundalini: "One
very common effect of rousing it prematurely is that it rushes downwards
in the body instead of upwards, and thus excites the most undesirable
passions—excites them and intensifies their effects to such a degree
that it becomes impossible for the man to resist them. because a force
has been brought into play, in whose presence he is as helpless as a
swimmer before the jaws of a shark".

The reader will find this kind of stuff in Chapter Four and in the next
Chapter he contradicts as follows: "It is said in some cases Kundalini
has been awakened not only by the will, but also by an accident; by a

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

blow or by physical pressure. I heard recently from one of our
Theosophical lecturers that he had come across an example of the kind
when touring in Canada. A lady, who knew nothing at all of these matters
fell down the cellar steps in her house. She lay for some time
unconscious, and when she awoke she found herself clairvoyant, able to
read the thoughts passing in other people's minds, and to see what was
going on in every room in the house; and this clairvoyance has remained
a permanent possession. One assumes that in this case in falling, the
lady must have received a blow at the base of the spine exactly in such
a position and of such a nature as to shock the Kundalini into partial
activity."

The miseries and dangers spoken of in the previous chapter, do not
appear to have been monstrous in this case.

I will now show my readers at what Rev. Leadbeater is driving. And he
does not hesitate, if, at the same time he gives a bad name to the Yoga
Philosophy, because he wants followers of his method of opening the
Kundalini, and really one can hardly blame Rev. Leadbeater, as it seems
to be the custom of the West to first give the other man a bad

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

name and then, seek his followers. For nearly half a century I have met
Master Yogis who have awakened their Kundalini and not in a single
instance did they claim they had opened it. Rev. Leadbeater is the first
man to come to my attention, who claims he has opened his Kundalini. For
the rest of the people he says: "but most people cannot gain it during
the present incarnation, if it is the first in which they have begun to
take these matters seriously in hand, but it is really for the majority,
the work of a later round altogether. The conquest of the serpent-fire
has to be repeated in each incarnation, since the vehicles are new each
time, but after it has been once thoroughly achieved these repetitions
will be an easy matter." Then on the same page he gives his own personal
experience: "It may be of use if I mention my own experience in this
matter. In the earlier part of my residence in India forty years ago I
made no effort to rouse the fire, not indeed knowing very much about it,
and having the opinion that, in order to do anything with it, it was
necessary to be born with a specially psychic body, which I did not
possess. But one day one of the Masters made a suggestion to me

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

with regard to a certain kind of meditation which would evoke this
force. Naturally I at once put the suggestion into practice, and in
course of time was successful. I have no doubt, however, that He watched
the experiment, and would have checked me if it had become dangerous. I
am told that there are Indian ascetics who teach this to their pupils,
of course keeping them under careful supervision during the process. But
I do not my self know of any such, nor would I have confidence in them
unless they were specially recommended by someone whom I knew to be
possessed of real knowledge."

Rev. Leadbeater claims he has opened the Kundalini, still he will not
have the confidence in the Hindu Master, unless they were specially
recommended by some ghost on the Astral Plane. Following, I will show
how he wants you to open the Kundalini: "People often ask me what I
advise them to do with regard to the arousing of this force. I advise
them to do exactly what I myself did. I recommend them to throw
themselves into theosophical work and wait until they receive a definite
command from some Master who will undertake to superintend their psychic
development, continuing

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

in the meantime all the ordinary exercises of meditation that are known
to them. They should not care in the least whether such development
comes in this incarnation or in the next, but should regard the matter
from the point of view of the ego and not of the personality, feeling
absolutely certain that the Masters are always watching for those whom
They can help, that it is entirely impossible for anyone to be
overlooked, and that They will unquestionably give Their directions when
They think that the right time has come."

It would really be a great joy to all Yogis if, Rev. Leadbeater will
leave the Yoga Philosophy alone and give to the world what he wants, but
by all means, call it by some other name.

This is not a pleasure to me to criticise some other writer, but I
believe it is the duty of every Yogi, to give to those who are seeking
information, only that which he (the Yogi) knows to be correct about the
Kundalini—the Mother of the Universe.

The following is an article on the same subject, by Arthur Avalon. He,
too, questions Rev. Leadbeater's remarks.

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

#### From pp. 6 to 18

#### Mr. A. Avalon's, "The Serpent Power."

"We may here notice the account of a well-known "Theosophical" author
(Mr. C. W. Leadbeater), regarding what he calls the "Force Centres" and
the "Serpent Fire," of which he writes that he has had
[personal](errata.htm#41.md) experience. Though Mr. Leadbeater also refers
to the Yoga Shastra, it may perhaps exclude error if we here point out
that his account does not profess to be a representation of the teaching
of the Indian Yogis (whose competence for their own Yoga the author
somewhat disparages), but that it is put forward as the Author's own
original explanation (fortified, as he conceives, by certain portions of
Indian teaching) of the personal experience which (he writes) he himself
has had. This experience appears to consist in the conscious arousing of
the "Serpent Fire," <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) with the enhanced
"astral" and mental vision which he believes has shown him what he tells
us. <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10.md)

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The centres, or
Chakras, of the human body are by Mr. Leadbeater described to be
vortices of "etheric" matter <span id="fr_11"></span>[3](#fn_11.md) into
which rush from the "astral" <span id="fr_12"></span>[4](#fn_12.md) world,
and at right angles to the plane of the whirling disc, the sevenfold
force of the Logos bringing "divine life" into the physical body. Though
all these seven forces operate on all the centres, in each of them one
form of the force is greatly predominant. These inrushing forces are
alleged to set up on the surface of the "etheric double" <span
id="fr_13"></span>[5a](#fn_13.md) secondary forces at right angles to
themselves. The primary force on entrance into the vortex radiates again
in straight lines, but at right angles. The number of these radiations
of the primal force is said to determine the number of "petals" <span
id="fr_14"></span>[6](#fn_14) (as the Hindus call them.md) which the
"Lotus" or vortex exhibits. The secondary force rushing round the vortex
produces, it is said, the appearance of the petals of a flower, or,
"perhaps more accurately, saucers or shallow vases of wavy iridescent
glass". In this way—that is, by supposition of an etheric vortex subject
to an incoming

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

force of the Logos—both the "Lotuses" described in the Hindu books and
the number of their petals is accounted for by the author, who
substitutes for the Svadhishthana centre a six-petalled lotus at the
spleen, <span id="fr_15"></span>[5b](#fn_15.md) and corrects the number of
petals of the lotus in [the](errata.htm#42.md) head, which he says is not a
thousand, as the book of this Yoga say, "but exactly 960". <span
id="fr_16"></span>[6a](#fn_16.md)

"There are some resemblances between this account and the teaching of
the Yoga Shastra, with which in a general way the author cited appears
to have some acquaintance, and which may have suggested to him some
features of his account. There are firstly seven centres, which with one
exception correspond with the Chakras described. The author says that
there are three other lower centres, but that concentration on them is
full of danger. What these are is not stated. There is no centre lower,
that I am aware of, than the Muladhara (as the name "root-centre" itself
implies), and the only centre near to it which is excluded, in the
above-mentioned account, is the Apas Tattva centre, or Svadhishthana.
Next there is the Force "the

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Serpent Fire,"
which the Hindus call Kundalini, in the lowest centre, the Muladhara.
Lastly, the effect of the rousing of this force, which is accomplished
by will power (Yogabala), <span id="fr_17"></span>[8](#fn_17.md) is said to
exalt the physical consciousness through the ascending planes to the
"heaven world". To use the Hindu expression, the object and aim of
Shatchakrabheda is Yoga. This is ultimately union with the Supreme Self
or Paramatma; but it is obvious, that as the body in its natural state
is already, though unconsciously, in Yoga, otherwise it would not exist,
each conscious step upwards is Yoga, and there are many stages of such
before complete or Kaivalya Mukti is attained. This and, indeed, many of
the. preceding stages are far beyond the "heaven world" of which the
author speaks. Yogis are not concerned with the "heaven world," but seek
to surpass it; otherwise they are not Yogis at all. What, according to
this theory, manifested force apparently does is this: it enhances the
mental and moral qualities of the self-operator as they existed at the
time of its discovery. But if this be so, such enhancement may be as
little desirable as the original state.

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Apart from the
necessity for the possession of health and strength, the thought, will,
and morality, which it is proposed to subject to its influence must be
first purified and strengthened before they are intensified by the
vivifying influence of the aroused force. Further, as I have elsewhere
pointed out, <span id="fr_18"></span>[9](#fn_18.md) the Yogis say that the
piercing of the Brahmagranthi or "knot" <span
id="fr_19"></span>[10](#fn_19.md) sometimes involves considerable pain,
physical disorder, and even disease, as is not unlikely to follow from
concentration on such a centre as the navel (Nabhipadma).

"To use Hindu terms, the Sadhaka must be competent (Adhikari), a matter
to be determined by his Guru, from whom alone the actual method of Yoga,
can be learned. The incidental dangers, however, stated by Mr.
Leadbeater go beyond any mentioned to me by Indians themselves, who seem
to be in general unaware of the subject of "phallic sorcery", to which
reference is made by Mr. Leadbeater, who speaks of schools of
(apparently Western) 'Black Magic" which are said to use Kundalini for
the purpose of stimulating the sexual centre. Another author

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

says: <span id="fr_20"></span>[11](#fn_20.md) "The mere dabbler in the
pseudo-occult will only degrade his intellect with the puerilities of
psychism, become the prey of the evil influence of the phantasmal world,
or ruin his soul by the foul practices of phallic sorcery—as thousands
of misguided people are doing even in this age." Is this so? It is
possible that perverse or misguided concentration on sexual and
connected centres may have the effect alluded to. And it may be that the
Commentator Lakshmidara alludes to this when he speaks of Uttara Kaulas
who arouse Kundalini in the Muladhara to satisfy their desire for
world-enjoyment and do not attempt to lead Her upwards to the Highest
Centre which is the object of Yoga seekings super-worldly bliss. Of
such, a Sanskrit verse runs "they are the true prostitutes". I have,
however, never heard Indians refer to this matter, probably because, it
does not belong to Yoga in its ordinary sense, as also by reason of the
antecedent discipline required of those who would undertake this Yoga,
the nature of their practice, and the aim they have in view, such a
possibility does not come under consideration.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Indian who
practices this or any other kind of spiritual Yoga ordinarily does so
not on account of a curious interest in occultism or with a desire to
gain "astral" or similar experiences. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[12](#fn_21.md) His attitude in this as in all other
matters is essentially a religious one, based on a firm faith in Brahman
(Sthiranishtha), and inspired by a desire for union with It which is
liberation.

"Assuming for argument the alleged correspondence, then the "etheric
centres" or Chakras of Mr. Leadbeater's account appear to be centres of
energy of Prana-vayu—or Vital Force. The lotuses are also this and
centres of the universal consciousness. Kundalini is the static form of
the creative energy in bodies which is the source of all energies,
including Prana. According to Mr. Leadbeater's theory, Kundalini is some
force which is distinct from Prana, understanding this term to mean
vitality of the life-principle, which on entrance into the body shows
itself in various manifestations of life which are the minor Pranas, of
which inspiration is called by the general name of the

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

force itself (Prana). Verses 10 and 11 says of Kundalini: "It is She who
maintains all the beings (that is, jiva, jivatma) of the world by means
of inspiration and expiration." She is thus the Prana Devata, but, as
She is (Comm., vv. 10 and 11) Srishti-sthitilayatmika, all forces
therefore are in Her. She is, in fact, the Shabdabrahman or "Word" in
bodies. The theory discussed appears to diverge from that of the Yogis
when we consider the nature of the Chakras and the question of their
vivification. According to Mr. Leadbeater's account, the Chakras are all
vortices of "etheric matter", apparently of the same kind and subject to
the same external influence of the inrushing sevenfold force of the
"Logos" but differing in this, that in each of the Chakras one or other
of their sevenfold forces is predominant. Again, if, as has been stated,
the astral body corresponds with the Manomayakosha, then the
vivification of the Chakras appears to be, according to Mr. Leadbeater,
a rousing of the Kamik side of the mental sheath. According to the Hindu
doctrine, these Chakras are differing centres of consciousness,
vitality, and Tattvik energy. Each of the five lower Chakras is the
centre of

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

energy of a gross Tattva—that is, of that form of Tattvik activity or
Tanmatra which manifests the Mahabhuta or sensible matter. The sixth is
the centre of the subtle mental Tattva, and the Sahasrara is not called
a Chakra at all. Nor, as stated, is the splenic centre included among
the six Chakras which are dealt with in this account.

"In the Indian system the total number of the petals corresponds with
the number of the letters of the Sanskrit Alphabet, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[13](#fn_22.md) and the number of the petals of any
specific lotus is determined by the disposition of the subtile "nerves"
Nadis around it. These petals, further, bear subtile sound-powers, and
are fifty in number, as are the letters of the Sanskrit Alphabet.

"This work also describes certain things which are gained by
contemplation on each of the Chakras. Some of them are of general
character, such as long life, freedom from desire and sin, control of
the senses, knowledge, power of speech, and fame. Some of these and
other qualities are results common to concentration on more than one
Chakra. Others are stated in connection with the contemplation upon one
centre only. Such [statements](errata.htm#43.md)

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

seem to be made, not necessarily with the intention of accurately
recording the specific. result, if any, which follows upon concentration
upon a particular centre, but by way of praise for increased
self-control, or Stuti-vada; as where it is said in v. 21 that
contemplation on the Nabhi-padma gains for the Yogi power to destroy and
create the world.

"It is also said that mastery of the centres may produce various Siddhis
or powers in respect of the predominating elements there. And this is,
in fact, alleged. <span id="fr_23"></span>[14](#fn_23.md) Pandit Ananta
Shastri says: <span id="fr_24"></span>[15](#fn_24.md) "We can meet with
several persons every day elbowing us in the streets or bazaars who in
all sincerity attempted to reach the highest plane of bliss, but fell
victims on the way to the illusions of the psychic world, and stopped at
one or the other of the six Chakras. They are of varying degrees of
attainment, and are seen to possess some power which is not found even
in the best intellectuals of the ordinary run of mankind. That this
school of practical psychology was working very well in India at one
time is evident from these living instances

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (not to speak of
the numberless treatises on the subject) of men roaming about in all
parts of the country." The mere rousing of the Serpent power does not,
from the spiritual Yoga standpoint, amount to much. Nothing, however, of
real moment, from the higher Yogis' point of view, is achieved until the
Ajna Chakra is reached. Here, again, it is said that the Sadhaka whose
Atma is nothing but a meditation on this lotus "becomes the creator,
preserver, and destroyer, of the three worlds"; and yet, as the
commentator points out (v. 34), "This is but the highest Prashangsa-vada
or Stutivada—that is, compliment—which in Sanskrit literature is as
often void of reality as it is in our ordinary life. Though much is here
gained, it is not until the Tattvas of this centre are also absorbed,
and complete knowledge <span id="fr_25"></span>[16](#fn_25.md) of the
Sahasrara is gained, that the Yogi attains that which is both his aim
and the motive of his labour, cessation from rebirth which follows on
the control and concentration of the Chitta on the Shivasthanam, the
Abode of Bliss. It is not to be

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

supposed that simply because the Serpent Fire has been aroused that one
has thereby become a Yogi or achieved the end of Yoga. There are other
points of difference which the reader will discover for himself, but
into which I do not enter, as my object in comparing the two accounts
has been to establish a general contrast between this modern account and
that of the Indian schools. I may, however, add that the differences are
not only as to details. The style of thought differs in a way not easy
shortly to describe, but which will be quickly recognised by those who
have some familiarity with the Indian Scriptures and mode of thought.
The latter is ever disposed to interpret all [processes](errata.htm#45.md)
and their results from a subjective standpoint, though for the purposes
of Sadhana the objective aspect is not ignored. The Indian theory is
highly philosophical. Thus, to take but one instance, whilst Mr.
Leadbeater attributes the power of becoming large or small at will
(Anima and Mahima Siddhi) to a flexible tube or "microscopic snake" in
the forehead, the Hindu says that all powers (Siddhi) are the attributes
(Aishvaryya) of the Lord Ishvara, or Creative Consciousness, and that in
the degree that

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

the Jiva realises that consciousness <span
id="fr_26"></span>[17](#fn_26.md) he shares the powers inherent in the
degree of his attainment.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[153:1](kmu14.htm#fr_9.md) This and the following
notes compare his and the Indian theory. The Devi or Goddess is called
Bhujangi or serpent because at the lowest centre (Muladhara) she lies
"coiled" round the Linga. "Coiled"—at rest. The Cosmic Power in bodies
is here at rest; when rouged it is felt as intense heat.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[153:2](kmu14.htm#fr_10.md) Certain Siddhis or
occult powers are acquired at each center as the practitioner works his
way upwards.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[154:3](kmu14.htm#fr_11.md) The petals of the lotus

magic of the kind mentioned work only in the lowest centre, have
recourse to the Prayoga, which leads to Mayika Shiddhi, whereby commerce
is had with female spirits and the like. The process in this work
described is one upon the path of liberation and has nothing to do with
sexual black magic.

liberation.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[163:16](kmu14.htm#fr_25.md) This, it is obvious,
comes only after long effort, and following on less complete experiences
and results. According to Indian notions, success (Siddhi) in Yoga may
be the fruit of experiences of many [preceding](errata.htm#44.md) lives.
Kundalini must be gradually raised from one centre to another until she
reaches the Lotus in the cerebrum. The length of time required varies in
the individual—it may be years ordinarily or in exceptional cased
months.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[165:17](kmu14.htm#fr_26.md) As this is by the
Devi's grace, She is called "the giver of the eight Siddhis"
(Ishitvadyashtasiddhida). See Trishati, II. 47. She gives Aishvaryya.
