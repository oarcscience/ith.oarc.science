### CHAMPAK.

THEN all night long, he tossed on his bed of leaves, and in the morning
he arose very early, long before the sun, and went out upon the steps,
and stood waiting. And he looked up, and saw in the air high above him a
row of swans, flying swiftly to the north, with bodies that gleamed
ruddy in the beams of the day-star still hidden behind the eastern
mountain. And then at last the sun rose, and at that moment he looked,
and

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

saw the *chétí* once more coming rapidly towards him. And she seemed in
his eyes like an incarnation of the dew of the morning, and like an
emblem of the love that was rising from its ashes in his own heart,
embodied in a feminine form. And she carried in her hand a champak
flower; and she came up to the King, perfuming the air, and said: O
King, my mistress sends her lord, by these unworthy hands, a flower, and
if he has enjoyed good repose, it is well with her.

Then the King said: Dear *chétí*, how can he enjoy repose, whose friends
desert him? And she said: O King, if his friends abandon him, the fault
is his own, who had not discrimination sufficient to discern the false
from the true. And the King sighed. And he said: Alas! it is hard to
tell. And they are few who in this world of illusion can detect and
distinguish between the good and the bad. For baseness assumes
innumerable disguises, and can present itself even under a form like
thine. Then she said with a smile: O King, be not too sure in my case.
And the King said: I am sure of nothing, but this: that life is
worthless when love is gone. And she said: That cannot go, which was
never present, and love cannot have left thee, which thou hast never
known. And the King said

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

in astonishment: And dost thou know anything of love, that art but a
child? Then she looked at him awhile in silence. And then she said: O
King, this is a matter neither of youth nor age, but of inheritance and
recollection. For as a rule, men learn only by experience, and get it
only when their hair is grey. But there are some, whose memories are
very strong, and they carry with them knowledge that never leaves them,
from one birth to the next; and are wise, by reason of the
influences <span id="fr_24"></span>[l](#fn_24.md) that come down to them
out of the oblivion of the past. And of these, know that I am one. And
what though I am, as thou sayest, but a child: yet in such a case as
this, a child may be wiser than a king: and it may be, that I am wiser
even than thou art. For I worshipped in a former birth the God of the
flowery-bow, and learned from his favour secrets, which have bequeathed
to me impressions even in this birth. And now I will tell thee a little
of what thou dost not know. Love is a triple cord <span
id="fr_25"></span>[m](#fn_25.md). And when all

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

three strands are firmly bound together, then nothing can break or end
it, not even death. But if either of the three be taken by itself, then
it snaps under the pressure of the circumstances and trials of life. And
thus it was with thee. In thy case, the three were not combined: and thy
love was a unison and not a harmony. And the King said: And what, then,
are the three? Then she said: Three kinds of love must meet together, to
make up that which is perfect and complete: that of the body, and that
of the intellect, and that of the soul. And thus it can exist, only
between a woman and a man. For each sex cares only for the beauty of the
other, and is unconscious of its own: and unless there is a difference
of sex, there is no bodily attraction, and thus one element is wanting.
And she, that is to retain her lover's love for ever, must possess,
first, a body without a flaw, or his senses will stray from her to other
bodies; for it is their nature to seek their proper object: and
secondly, intelligence, or his esteem will depart elsewhere: and
thirdly, goodness, or his soul will abandon her, in the search for that
without which

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

it cannot do, and without which, the other two component parts are
worthless, except for a time. And as it is with the woman, so is it for
the man, with this difference, that their bodies and their intelligences
and their souls are totally unlike. For that which is virtue in a woman,
may be its opposite in a man, and his weakness may be her strength, and
even her ornament. But thou wert foolish, in not wisely choosing the
proper object of thy love. For doubtless she was beautiful, but that was
all: and now it was surely a good for thee, and no harm, that she
betrayed thee when she did. For though thou didst receive at the moment
a wound sharper than a sword; yet time, and it may be, circumstance,
will heal it: and certainly time would have shown thee in her case, that
elements were wanting to the perfection of thy love, and it would not
have endured. And now thou art free, and punished for thy error, and
wiser: and it befits thee rather to rejoice than mourn. For who knows
what awaits him in the future? and who can expect to achieve the highest
good <span id="fr_26"></span>[n](#fn_26.md) who does not know what it is
like? And thou wilt find, no doubt, the perfect trinity of love with my
mistress, for I would hope that she is worthy of thee.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

And as she spoke, the King stood spell-bound. But as she ended, he
started and exclaimed: Away! speak not of thy mistress, for she is a
matter of policy and statecraft: tell me only of thyself: for surely
thou art furnished with cords <span id="fr_27"></span>[o](#fn_27.md) strong
enough to make the love of thee immortal, and bind thy lover to thee
with a knot that will never break. But the *chétí* put her finger on her
lip. And she shook her pretty head at the King, and said: Hush! speak
not thus to me, or I shall not come again. And she looked at him with a
smile, and laid the flower at his feet, and turned and went away. But
just before she disappeared, she turned round, and looked at the King,
and then she entered the trees and vanished from his eyes.

And the King stooped and picked up the flower, and put it to his lips.
And he sighed, and said: Champak, thy odour is like the very essence of
the fragrance of love, and well is it suited to the words of this
irresistible maiden, who resembles that self-same essence incarnated by
the will of the Creator, in a wholly different, yet equally delicious
form. And he went back to the temple with the flower in his hand, buried
in meditation on the words of

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Madhupamanjarí and utterly oblivious of all
else. For her beauty, like a cunning painter effacing one picture to
make room for another, had obliterated every stain left by gloomy
recollections on the surface of his soul.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_24"></span>[31:l](htd08.htm#fr_24.md) Nothing is more
universally distributed throughout Hindoo literature than this idea of
the overpowering influences of transmitted reminiscences and
consequences from previous births. It is only a profound truth in a
mythological form.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[31:m](htd08.htm#fr_25.md) There is a play on words
here which cannot be translated, <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> for
*guna* means not only a *cord* or *string*, but also a moral *quality*
or *virtue*: and yet again, a *power* or *multiple*.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[33:n](htd08.htm#fr_26.md) *purushárta*--' the goal
of man.'

<span id="fn_27"></span>[34:o](htd08.htm#fr_27.md) Here again *cords* =
*virtues*.
