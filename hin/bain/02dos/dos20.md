lovers regained their immortal natures. And they looked at one another,
dazed and bewildered, for they thought that they had awoken from a

abandoned, and soared away to their heavenly home, locked in each
other's arms.

all, by the power of his mystical intuition, he said to himself: There
are those two foolish lovers rejoicing to have awoken from a dream; not
knowing that it was but a dream within a dream, and that they are still
asleep. And he laughed aloud: and the thunder of the shout of his
laughter rolled and reverberated, and rattled in the blue hollows of
Himálaya, like the sound of a drum.
