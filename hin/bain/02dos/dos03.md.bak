# SUNSET

#### AN EVIL EYE.

# The Descent of the Sun.

### INVOCATION.

*O glorious and infinite Spirit of Peace, Lord of Ascetics, who whirling
round in thy wild dance dost lend as it were its colour to the sky, in
whose mirror are seen reflected the blueness of thy throat and the
silver digit of the moon in the matted tufts of thy tawny hair: thee we
adore. And we worship the ever victorious trunk of the Elephant of
Elephants, whose fierce glare consumes the innumerable hosts of opposing
obstacles, as a forest fire shrivels the blades of dry grass* <span
id="fr_4"></span>[a](#fn_4.md).

 

LONG ago, on the slopes of Himálaya, there lived a young King of the
Spirits of the Air, named Kamalamitra <span id="fr_5"></span>[b](#fn_5.md);
for he was a portion of the Sun.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And he worshipped the husband of Umá  <span
id="fr_6"></span>[c](#fn_6.md). And he turned his back on the pleasures of
the senses, and went afar off, and dwelt alone, among the icy peaks and
snowy plateaux that lie around Kailás. And there he remained, living at
first upon leaves, and then upon smoke, and finally upon air, performing
penances of appalling severity, till after a hundred years <span
id="fr_7"></span>[d](#fn_7.md) that Lord of Creatures was moved to
compassion. And he appeared to him, in the twilight of evening, in the
guise of an ascetic, but in stature like a tall tree, with the new moon
in his hair, and said: I am pleased with thy devotion, so now I grant
thee a boon: ask. Then the young King bowed before him, and said:
Blessed One, let me continue in this contemplation of thee: that is
enough. Then said Maheshwara: This is well said: nevertheless, ask of me
some boon. Then said Kamalamitra: Since it is so, and I must absolutely
choose, then give me a wife, whose eyes, like these hills and this sky,
shall be full of the dusky lustre <span id="fr_8"></span>[e](#fn_8.md) of
thy throat and thy moon, as

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

if, insatiate of gazing at thee, they had become, not transitory
mirrors, but pictures permanently stained with thy glory. For so shall
she be a medium of devotion between me and thee.

Then the moon-crested God was pleased. But he looked into the future, by
his magic power of divination, and saw what was coming. And he said
slowly: Eyes such as these will be dangerous, not only to others, but
also to their owner. Nevertheless, I have given thee a boon: thou shalt
have thy desire.

Then he disappeared, and Kamalamitra returned home rejoicing. And by the
favour of the deity all the emaciation and fatigue of his penances left
him, and he became strong as Bhima and beautiful as Arjuna <span
id="fr_9"></span>[f](#fn_9.md). And he arrived at his palace on the evening
of the next day, and went into the garden to repose, as the sun was
going down. And as he went, he looked before him, and suddenly he saw a
woman, floating on a pool of white lotuses, in a boat of sandal, with
silver oars. And her glances fell on those snowy flowers, and turned
their tint to blue, for her eyes were lowered, and she was resting

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

her chin on one hand as she lay, and with the other dropping one by one
into the water the petals of a lotus red as blood. And the round curve
of her hip stood up like a sand bank, and was mirrored again in the
silent water below. And her lips moved, for she was counting the petals
as they fell.

And Kamalamitra stood still, holding his breath, and gazing at her,
fearing to move, for he thought it was a dream. Then all at once she
looked up and saw him, and smiled, bathing him with the colour of her
eyes. And it seemed to Kamalamitra that he stood in a pool of colour
formed by the essence of all the blue lotuses in the world. And then
suddenly he remembered the boon of the God who is clothed with
heaven <span id="fr_10"></span>[g](#fn_10.md), and he exclaimed: Surely
thou art my own wife, sent me by the God who keeps his promises, and
none other. For yesterday I gazed at his glory, and now I am gazing at
thy two eyes, and it is the same. And if it be so, by what name shall I
call thee? Then she said: My name is Anushayiní <span
id="fr_11"></span>[h](#fn_11.md), and for what

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

purpose did the Creator form these eyes, but to reflect the image of
their lord?

Then Kamalamitra, having thus obtained her from the deity, took
possession of his lovely little wife, and thereafter remained with her
in the region about Kailás, utterly bewildered and intoxicated by
constantly gazing at those mirrors of deity, her two great eyes. And he
plunged into their sea, and was drowned in it, and the whole world
seemed to him to be made of lotus blue <span
id="fr_12"></span>[i](#fn_12.md). And like a vessel filled to the brim and
running over, he was so overflowing with delight in her beauty, and the
pride of having so unique a specimen of womankind all to himself, that
he could not contain his emotion, but sought relief in going about
everywhere talking about her, and trying to get everybody to
acknowledge, what he thought himself, that all other women in the world
were absolutely nothing in comparison with his own wife. Alas! a woman
is one thing, and emancipation quite another.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

So it happened, that on a day, when he was disputing about her with one
of his friends, and abusing him, for not readily admitting all his own
eulogies of his wife, that friend of his suddenly burst out laughing,
and exclaimed: For all things there is a cure, even for snake-bite there
is a cure, but there is no cure, for one who has been bitten with a
woman's beauty. Know, O thou infatuated lover, that the golden glamour
of our Other Half, Man's ectype, Woman, is not like a simple musical
theme, but one infinitely various, containing ten thousand notes, and
stirring like a churning stick all the emotions in the ocean of the soul
of man. And however beautiful may be thy wife's eyes, still eyes are
only eyes, and a woman is not all eye, but something more. For one woman
witches us, like a waterfall, with the music of her bubbling laughter,
and another entrances us, like a forest-pool, with the peace of her
shadowy silence. And one entangles us, like Yama <span
id="fr_13"></span>[k](#fn_13.md), in the nectar-nooses of her hair, while
another pierces us, like Manobhawa <span id="fr_14"></span>[l](#fn_14.md),
with the archery of her poisoned eyes. And one enflames us, like the
Sun, in the fever-fire of sick desire, while another soothes us, like
the Moon, by

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

the camphor of her dewy kisses. And like oxen, we are goaded, by the
biting sting of one woman's evil, and like elephants, we are tamed, by
the subtle spell of another's purity; and like birds, we are decoyed, by
the lure of the bower of one girl's arms, and like bees, we hover and
sip, around the honey of another's lips, and like snakes, we wind and
coil <span id="fr_15"></span>[m](#fn_15.md) round the slender stem of one
girl's waist, and like weary travellers, we long to sleep on the living
pillow of another's bosom. Then Kamalamitra broke in impatiently: Away
with the fascinations, of all the women in the three worlds, past,
present, or to come! Could they unite to form the very body of the god
of love, yet the eyes of Anushayiní, alone, would, like the eye of the
enemy of Kaudarpa <span id="fr_16"></span>[n](#fn_16.md), reduce them to
ashes. Aye! those eyes, with their blue irresistible invitation, would
succeed in corrupting sages, where Menaká, Tilottamá <span
id="fr_17"></span>[o](#fn_17.md) and the rest had failed.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

Then his friend laughed in derision, and said: Boasting is useless, and
in words, all men can do everything, and every woman is another
Rambhá <span id="fr_18"></span>[p](#fn_18.md). Babble no more of her
beauty, but come, let your paragon of a wife put her power to the proof.
For hard by here, in the wood on the hillside, is an aged Sage, named
Pápanáshana <span id="fr_19"></span>[q](#fn_19.md), whose austerities
terrify even the gods. He would be an admirable touchstone for the eyes
of this wonderful wife of yours, whose beauty exists, like a bubble,
only on the stream of your words.

And then, stung by the taunt, Kamalamitra exclaimed in wrath: Fool! if
she does not turn him from his asceticism as easily as amber draws after
it stubble and grass, I will cut off my own head and cast it into the
Ganges. Then his friend laughed again, and said: Do nothing rash, thou
art not Daksha <span id="fr_20"></span>[r](#fn_20.md): once gone, thy head
can never be restored.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

\[paragraph continues\] But Kamalamitra hurried away to find Anushayiní.
And he found her in the garden by the lotus pool, and told her of his
brag, and said: Come instantly, and make the experiment, and vindicate
the power of those wonderful eyes of thine, and my own faith in them,
without delay. For I burn to convict that foolish sceptic of his folly,
by ocular demonstration.

Then Anushayiní said slowly: Dear husband, thou wert angry, and
therefore indiscreet, and I fear, lest by doing evil we may bring on
ourselves punishment. For expiation follows guilt, as surely as Orion
treads on the heels of Rohini <span id="fr_21"></span>[s](#fn_21.md) There
is sin and danger in this rash experiment. And now it will be better for
us not to venture upon the verge of a precipice, over which we may both
fall, into irreparable disaster.

But as she spoke, her eyes rested on Kamalamitra, and bewildered him,
and destroyed the persuasion of her words. For he heard nothing that she
said, but was full of the blindness of passion, and more than ever
convinced of the omnipotence of her beauty. And so, seeing that she
could not turn him from his will, Anushayiní gave in, and yielded ,

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

to him as to her deity. Nay, in the interior of her heart she rejoiced,
to find that she could not dissuade him, for she was filled with
curiosity herself; to see whether in truth her beauty would prevail over
the ascetic, though she trembled for the consequences. Alas i where
beauty, and curiosity, and youth, and self-will, and intoxication
combine, like a mad elephant, where is the cotton thread of
self-control?

Then those two lovers kissed each other passionately, like travellers
who have been separated for a year. And yet they knew not that they were
doing so for the last time. And then they went together to the forest,
to find that old ascetic. And hand-in-hand they rambled about, like a
pair of Love's arrows in human form <span id="fr_22"></span>[t](#fn_22.md),
till they penetrated to the very heart of that wood. And there on a
sudden they came upon that old sage, and saw him standing, plunged in
meditation, motionless as a tree. And round him the ants had built up
their hills, and his beard and hair trailed from his head, like
creepers, and ran down along the ground, and were covered with leaves:
and over his withered

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

limbs played a pair of lizards, like living emeralds. And he looked
straight before him, with great eyes that mirrored everything, but saw
nothing, clear and unfathomable and still, like mountain tarns in which
all the fish are asleep.

And Kamalamitra and Anushayiní looked at him awhile in silence, and then
at each other, and trembled, for they knew that they were staking their
souls. But as he wavered, the thought of his friend's derision came back
into Kamalamitra's mind, and filled him with anger. And he said to
Anushayiní: Advance, and let this old *muni* <span
id="fr_23"></span>[u](#fn_23.md) see you, and I will mark the result.

So Anushayiní went forward, obeying his command, and stepped over the
leaves with feet lighter than themselves, till she stood in front of the
sage. And when she saw that he did not move, she raised herself on
tiptoe to look into his eyes, saying to herself: Possibly he is dead.
And she looked into those eyes, and saw there nothing save two images of
herself; like two incarnations of timidity, that seemed to say to her as
it were: Beware! And as she stood there, trembling in the swing of
uncertainty, Kamalamitra watched her with ecstasy,

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

and laughed to himself; and said: Certainly that old *muni* is no longer
alive, for otherwise she would have reached his soul through the door of
his eyes, were it down in the lower world.

So as they stood there, waiting, gradually that old sage came to
himself: for he felt that his meditations were being disturbed by
something or other. And he looked, and saw Anushayiní standing before
him like the new moon at the close of day, a pure form of exquisite
beauty <span id="fr_24"></span>[x](#fn_24.md), a crystal without a flaw,
tinged with the colour of heaven. And instantly, by the power of his own
mystical meditation, he divined the whole truth, and the exact state of
the case. And he cast at that wayward beauty a glance, sorrowful as that
of a deer, yet terrible as a thunderbolt: and immediately courage fled
from her soul, and strength from her knees, and she sank to the ground
with drooping head, like a lotus broken by the wind.

But Kamalamitra rushed forward, and caught her in his arms. Then as they
stood together, the old ascetic spoke and cursed them, saying slowly:
Irreverent

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

lovers, now shall that beauty which occasioned this insolence meet with
its [appropriate](errata.htm#0.md) reward. Descend now, ye guilty ones,
into mortal wombs, and suffer in the lower world the pangs of
separation, till ye have purged away your guilt in the fire of human
sorrow.

Then hearing the doom of separation, wild with grief they fell at his
feet, and implored him, saying: Fix at least a term to the curse, and a
period to our pain. And he said again: When one of you shall slay the
other, the curse shall end.

Then those two unhappy lovers looked at each other in mute despair. And
they drew in that instant from each other's eyes a deep draught of the
nectar of mutual contemplation, as if to sustain them in their
pilgrimage over the terrible sea of separation, saying as it were to
each other, but in vain <span id="fr_25"></span>[y](#fn_25.md): Remember
me! Then all of a sudden they disappeared and went, like flashes of
lightning, somewhere else.

 

But Maheshwara, from his seat on Kailás, saw them go, for as fate would
have it, he chanced to

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

be looking in that direction. And grasping the whole truth by mystical
intuition <span id="fr_26"></span>[z](#fn_26.md), he remembered his boon to
the Spirit of the Air, and he said to himself: Now has the future which
I foresaw become the present <span id="fr_27"></span>[a](#fn_27.md), and
the blue eyes of Anushayiní have produced a catastrophe. But I must not
leave her lovely body to the play of chance, for it has in it something
of my own divinity. And Kamalamitra, after all, was not very much to
blame. For he was bewildered by my glory, reflected in her eyes. So I am
the culprit, who is responsible for this state of affairs: and so I must
look after this pair of lovers. Moreover, I have a mind to amuse myself
with their adventures <span id="fr_28"></span>[b](#fn_28.md).

So after considering awhile, that Master Yogi took a lotus, and placing
it on the earth in a distant sea, it became an island. And he made in
it, by his magic power, an earthly copy of a heavenly type, of a nature
known to himself alone, for the future to unfold. And having completed
his

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

arrangements, he allowed the chain of events to take its course.

But the old sage Pápanáshana, when those two lovers had disappeared,
remained in the forest alone. And their images forsook the mirror of his
eyes, and faded away from his mind, like the shadow of a cloud
travelling over the surface of a great lake, and vanished, and were
utterly forgotten.
