### X. Separation

And he reeled about like a drunken man, this way and that way, jostling
the people, who marvelled and mocked at him: See, see, the ragged
Rajpoot, the suitor of the King's daughter, whose very sight has killed
her! But he heard nothing but the words of Shrí, and saw nothing but her
eyes. And he staggered on, like a woo en doll, on feet that moved of
their own accord, till as before he reached the tank, and sank down upon
the ground, knowing neither where he was nor what

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

he did, puzzled about the quarters of the world <span
id="fr_66"></span>[p](#fn_66.md). And like a man, out of whose universe the
sun and moon and the five elements with their compounds have withdrawn,
leaving him alone in the centre of empty space, he lay motionless,
plunged in stupor, with dry eyes. Then all at once memory returned to
him, and he began to weep. And he wept, as if he contained within him
the very fountains of the salt sea, till at last from weariness and
grief he fell asleep on the edge of the tank. And in his dreams Shrí
stood beside him, and revived his parched soul with the nectar of her
kindly glance, as a hermit's daughter refreshes with water the plants of
the hermitage committed to her charge.

And after drinking deep draughts from those two fountains of pity and
love, he awoke, and found that it was now night, and again he was alone
at the moonlit tank. And he said to himself: Alas! alas! I found my
bride, and lost her again at the same instant, through the terrible
operation of sins committed in a former birth. Now indeed I am alone,
for this time she is gone I know not where, and how am I to look for
her? And yet she told me we should meet again, to keep me from despair.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Therefore now I will wander away over the wide
world, and spend my life in seeking her: for but this, nothing is left
in life, and the hope of reunion is like the back of the Great Tortoise,
my solitary refuge in the wreck of the three worlds.

So he rose up, and went out of the city, and wandered about, hither and
thither, like a bubble on the waves of time. And he went from village to
village, and from city to city, asking everywhere of all whom he met:
Have you seen Shrí, my wife? you will know her by her eyes, for they are
full of the colour of heaven. But however much he asked, he found no
answer: nor could anyone tell him anything about her. On the contrary,
all wondered at him and turned him to ridicule. And one would say: Who
is this moon-struck vagabond who roams about looking for a blue-eyed
beauty? And another: What wonder that Shrí has deserted such a ragged
mendicant, who forsakes even the well-to-do! And others said: This
distracted Rajpoot wants the moon, but he needs medicines <span
id="fr_67"></span>[q](#fn_67.md). And at last he abandoned altogether the
dwellings of

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

men, and wandered continually in the jungle, with no companions but his
shadow and his sword, looking in vain for the path by which he had gone
on his former journey to the Land of the Lotus, and gazing by day at the
pools of blue lotuses, and by night at the heaven with its stars, for
they were like mirrors and images of the hues and shadows of the eyes of
Shrí.

*desorienté*.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[79:q](dos13.htm#fr_67.md) The point of these gibes
depends on the various meanings of the word Shrí: which may mean his
wife, or the goddess of fortune, or the moon: out of which come herbs or
medicines.
