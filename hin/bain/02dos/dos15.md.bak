### XII. The Other Body

But in the meanwhile Shrí <span id="fr_71"></span>[u](#fn_71.md), when she
abandoned the body in Indirálayá, flew in the twinkling of an eye to the
Land of the Lotus of the Sun. And there she entered that other body,
lying in a couch in the Palace hall. Then instantly she opened her eyes,
and rose up, as if awaking from a dream. And she was filled with
astonishment, terror, and dismay, when she found herself alone in the
empty hall. And she exclaimed: Alas! what is this mystery, and how came
I into this deserted hall, and in which quarter of the world am I, and
what has become of my husband? Now do I see the terrible consequences of
sins committed in a former birth. Alas! how am I to regain him, and
where is he to be found? Surely we are like two tiny fishes in the
infinite ocean of time. Yet even so, despair is unavailing. Did not Sitá
recover Ráma, and Shakuntalá, Dushyanta, and Damayanti cross the ocean
of separation, and repose on the shore in the shape of the embraces of
Nala? Truly omnipotent is the power of love, and what love was ever
greater than mine? For it passes on from

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

body to body, and draws fresh fire from each new birth.

Then she dressed herself in the white pall <span
id="fr_72"></span>[x](#fn_72.md), and went hastily out of that empty
palace, shrinking like a fawn at the echo of her own footsteps, and
passed out of the gates, and ran through the deserted streets, down to
the very edge of the sea. And there she stood with her bare feet lapped
by the waves, looking out eagerly over the sea, with eyes that laughed
at and shamed it of its blue. And it rose in agitation at her beauty, as
if stirred by the moon, while the wind kissed her unaware, and played
with her hair and clothes. Then she said: O Ocean, art thou too parted
from someone, that thou heavest long drawn sighs? Art thou also wrenched
with grief, that thou sprinklest me with the salt tears of thy spray?

And as she gazed, there appeared tossing on the

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

waves a ship, like the realization of her desire to cross the ocean in
visible form. Now that ship belonged to a great merchant captain, who
was returning home from a trading voyage. And when he saw a female
figure standing alone on the shore, he came quickly in a boat to take
her captive. But when he got to the shore, and saw the wonderful beauty
of her dark blue eyes and snow white raiment, he was struck with wonder,
and became afraid. And he said to her in awe: Surely thou art some
divinity, and no mere mortal maiden. Tell me thy name, that I may know
whom to adore. Then said Shrí: Sir, I am no divinity, but a king's
daughter; and I am seeking for my husband. Carry me, of your kindness,
over the sea, for I must find my way to Indirálayá. But hearing this,
that merchant was overjoyed; for he thought: Indirálayá is in another
quarter of the world, and I will be her husband. For he was drowned in
the ocean of her eyes. So he said to her: O thou true daughter of a
King, my ship is thine and all that it contains. Come now, and I will
carry thee whithersoever thou wilt. So Shrí consented. And the merchant
in his delight counted the whole world as a straw, thinking he had got
her for a wife.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

So when he got to the ship, he said to her: Truly this husband of thine
is a sorry rascal. Out upon him, who could leave such an incomparable
beauty as thine to roam about the world without him! Forget him now, for
I will be thy husband. Then said Shrí: This is impiety, nor is my
husband to blame in this matter. Know, too, that to a good wife her
husband is a deity. Then said the merchant: Thou shalt marry me whether
thou wilt or not: and I care nothing for piety or impiety, but only for
thy wonderful eyes. And now I have thee, I will keep thee. So he carried
her in his ship, very carefully, closely guarded, to his own city, and
shut her in an upper chamber of his house, hoping to prevail on her in
course of time, neglecting his affairs.

Then Shrí said to herself: Alas for my beauty, which is a curse and no
blessing to me, in that it has placed me in the power of this headstrong
merchant! Nevertheless, even so, I have got over the sea. And now, I
must lose no time in escaping from this infatuated sinner, or worse
things may come about. And she went to the window and looked out. Now by
the ordinance of fate it so happened, that at that moment the King of
that city was passing by on his elephant. So when she

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

saw it, Shrí said to herself: There is my deliverance in the form of an
elephant. And now I must sin a little, to save myself from greater
guilt. Then she called to the mahout: Come nearer, O driver of the
elephant: for I am anxious to taste the delight of riding on an
elephant. And hearing this, the mahout looked at the King. And the King
looked at the face of Shrí. And Shrí shot at the King a blue glance from
her eye. And instantly the King lost his senses, and said to the mahout:
Do as she bids thee. So the mahout brought the elephant under the
window, and Shrí let herself fall from the window on to his back. And
she caught hold of the King to save herself from falling, and the King
almost fainted from excess of joy, and the nectar of her touch. And
without losing a moment, he carried her off to his palace, as delighted
as if he had conquered the whole earth. But the merchant, when he found
that she had gone, abandoned the body in his despair.

Then as soon as they reached the palace, the King said to Shrí: What is
thy name and family? Shrí said: I am a King's daughter from a far
country, and my name is Shrí. Then said the King: Thou didst well to
forsake that miserable trader for me. Should the lioness, forsooth! mate

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

with the jackal? And now will I place thee, like a choice jewel, in the
centre of my diadem, and thou shalt be the very apex of the summit of my
fortune <span id="fr_73"></span>[y](#fn_73.md). Then said Shrí: King, do
not speak thus. For I am the wife of another. And I fled to thee for
refuge, and not for frivolity: for yonder merchant would have made me
his wife by force. So do me justice, and let me go: for I may not be a
wife to thee.

Then said the King: Thy dark blue eyes have utterly destroyed my sense
of right and wrong, which are now mere words without meaning, impotent
to hold me as is a lotus stalk to fetter that elephant which brought
thee hither; and in vain dost thou talk to me of letting thee go: thou
askest me for my life: for till I saw those unfathomable blue lakes
which thou hast stolen to make thee eyes, I never lived. Only consent,
and I will efface by my devotion the memory of thy husband, as the sun
dries up a shallow pool. But Shrí said: Say not pool, but ocean, on
which the sun shines for ever, yet never makes it any less: for such is
my love to my husband.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

\[paragraph continues\] But the King paid no heed to her words, which
entered at his ear, but never reached his mind. For all his soul was in
his eyes, feasting on the face of Shrí, which made him drunk like the
juice of Soma <span id="fr_74"></span>[z](#fn_74.md).

Then seeing the state of the case, Shrí said to herself: Alas! I have
escaped the lesser danger only to incur the greater, and become the prey
of this unrighteous King. Now there is no help for me, save in
stratagem, and the natural craft of woman. And she lifted up her lashes,
and cast on the King a crooked glance, that almost deprived him of his
reason. And she said, moving her bow-arched eyebrows, with a smile: Out
upon the heart of woman, for it is soft as a flower, and averse to
constancy! Leave me awhile, for I must consider this matter. And yet,
stay not away too long, for thou art good to look upon, and well-fitted
to be my husband, were I not already the wife of another man. But
hearing this, the King was utterly bewildered, and doubted the testimony
of his ears. And he thought: Now she will consent, after a little
coaxing. And he looked at her as she stood smiling at him, bowing like

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

a flower from the weight of her bosom and the slenderness of her waist,
and laughed in his intoxication, befooled by the roundness of her limbs
and the blueness of her eyes, and forgetting that the Creator made woman
to be an instrument of delusion, with an exterior of honey and an
interior of poison. And he left her to perform his kingly duties,
intending to return without delay, and thinking the fruit of his birth
attained.

But as soon as he was gone, Shrí summoned a chamberlain, and said to
him: Take me to the Head Queen, and lose not a moment, or it will be the
worse for thee. And that chamberlain trembled and obeyed her, for he
feared her power, saying to himself: The King would throw his kingdom
into the sea for a glance from her eye, and now my life is on her
forefinger. So when Shrí came before the Queen, she said to her: Lady,
thou art my sole refuge. Know, that the King thy husband found me to-day
in the city, and stole me away, seeking to make me his wife. Now
contrive my escape, for I am the wife of another, and I may not be his
wife. And do it very quickly, for this is an opportunity which will
never occur again. Then the Queen looked at her, and said to herself:
She says well, and I must indeed send her away without

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

losing a moment. For if she remains here, and becomes his wife, the King
will abandon everything for her sake, and the state will go to ruin.
Moreover, he will never again have anything to do with me or any other
of his queens: for her beauty is like a very feminine incarnation of the
five arrows of the god of love.

So she summoned her confidential women; and they disguised Shrí as a
dancing girl, and conveyed her secretly out of the palace without delay.
But when the King returned, and found that she was gone, he became mad.
And he put to death, of his retainers, everything that was male.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[84:x](dos15.htm#fr_72.md) As this might sound
bizarre to the English reader, accustomed to the elaborate toilettes of
western ladies, he should know, that nothing can be more simple than the
dress of a Hindoo woman. A single long piece of stuff, wound like a
petticoat round the waist, secured, and thrown over the head to form a
veil, forms a garment that the Greeks might have envied. Nothing can
surpass the taste, beauty, and grace of the way in which it follows and
reveals without betraying the figure of its wearer.
