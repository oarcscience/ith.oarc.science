### PREFACE.

THE name of the little Indian fable, here presented to the lover of
curiosities in an English dress, is ambiguous. We may translate it
indifferently, either: *The new moon in the hair of the God of Gods:* or
else: *She that reduces the bride of Gods, demons, and all the rest of
creation;* that is, the Goddess of Beauty and Fortune. To those
unfamiliar with the peculiar genius of the Sanskrit language, it might
seem singular, that two such different ideas should be expressible by
the one and the same word. But it is just in this power of dexterous
ambiguity that the beauty of that language lies. As there are
butterflies’ and beetles’ wings, of which we find it impossible to say,
that they are positively this colour or that—for according to the light
in which we view them they change and turn, now dusky red, now
peacock-blue, now it may be dark purple or old gold—so a well formed
Sanskrit compound word will subtly shoot and coruscate with meaning, as
do those wondrous wings with colour: and this studied double, treble,
manifold signification of its words lends to the classic tongue a sort
of verbal sheen, a perpetual undercurrent of indirect suggestion, a
by-play of allusion, a prismatic

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

beauty, of which no other language can convey the least idea. For
translation must split up what in the original is a unity <span
id="fr_0"></span>[a](#fn_0.md). And so, our title, according to the value
which we choose to assign to its component elements, can be taken to
denote, either the hair-jewel of the moon-crested god, or the universal
pre-eminence of world-wildering Aphrodite.

And at the risk of incurring the charge of mysticism, I would venture
the opinion that our author, in wavering thus between two meanings, two
notions at first sight utterly distinct and different, has instinctively
seized a subtle analogy, difficult to analyse, and more obvious perhaps
in the clear and silent Indian atmosphere than in our own thick and
foggy clime: one, however, to which all ancient mythologies bear
witness, by invariably connecting their Great Goddesses with the Moon.
Night after night, when the fierce fury of the merciless intolerable
Indian sun has spent its energy—there are days in the hot weather, when
the very last ray from his disappearing rim seems to bore like a red-hot
nail into your skull and drain away your life like a great blood
leech—when *at last* the enemy has gone, and the blue mild lustrous Dark
with its healing, soothing, balmy peace has fallen over the fainting
world, I have

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

watched the inexhaustible Beauty of the Moon: and then it is, that there
seems as it were to glide into the soul, like a nurse into a sick room,
some thing, some presence, vast, infinite, and feminine. The pale and
shadowy Holda passes over the dusky dome, with the stars in her violet
hair, or is it rather the Blessed Virgin, the ancient hornèd Isis,
stretching colossal over the blue, with the Moon beneath her feet? Mere
fancy, says the reader: and yet I do not know. Something there seems to
be in common, something that all the ancient nations felt, between the
beauty of an eastern night with the Moon in its forehead, and the
strange consolatory cosmic magnetism that Woman and her mystic
Beauty <span id="fr_1"></span>[b](#fn_1.md) exert over her everlasting
patient, Man. Take away her sympathy, and his life would resemble
nothing so much as the thirsty earth, parching under an Indian Noon, for
ever without a Night.

For the proper comprehension of this story, the English reader ought to
know, that just as its keynote—*husband is a good wife's god*—is the
very core of Hindoo manners, so the type and model of all devoted wives,
the *Satí*, or Constant Wife, *par excellence*, is Párwatí, the wife of
the moon-crested God. He and she together are the symbol of wedded
harmony, so close and indissoluble, that they are regarded, under one
aspect, as having but a single body between them, which they

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

share: he is the god, *whose other, or left half, is his wife:* and
poets compare their relation to that obtaining between a *word* and its
*meaning*. They are the incarnation of bi-sexual unity, <span
class="smallcaps">Hermaphroditus</span>, the ideal type of sacred
indissoluble marriage. In India, marriage is still something more and
deeper than a contract, and has not therefore yet become ridiculous. In
India, the gods are not yet pallid spectral ghosts, rationalistic
*residua* of neuter gender, but the immortal lovers of their wives; and
conjugal affection is what it ought to be, typified in heaven, the
highest pleasure even of the gods. They carry their wives about in their
arms, sit them on their knee, and are inseparable from them. And in
return, their wives are their devoted slaves. *Who*, says the Hindoo
proverb, *is the best-loved woman? She that adores her husband as a
god*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[viii:a](iggh01.htm#fr_0.md) And it has often
occurred to me that western theologians suffer from want of acquaintance
with Sanskrit, for nothing could furnish so apt an illustration of an
indecomposable ' trinity in unity' as a compound Sanskrit word.

Euripides is pure Sanskrit: *patní naktá:* Lady Night.
