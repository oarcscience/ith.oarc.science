### XII. The Wind and the Leaves

<span class="smallcaps">Then</span> said Indra: O lady with a smile like
the opening of a *bakula* <span id="fr_28"></span>[t](#fn_28.md) blossom,
even if thou wert thyself deserving of excuse for falling victim to the
innocence and tenderness of thy own maiden and unsophisticated heart,
yet canst thou not exculpate thy husband, for coming like a thief at
night and stealing thee away. Well didst thou say thyself, that like a
moth thou hast flown into the fire, and burned away thy gauzy wings.

Then said Wanawallarí: Brahman, how can a weak woman hope to avoid a
fate that overtakes

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

even the greatest gods? Was not the god of love himself shrivelled like
a butterfly in the fire of the Great God's eye? And how then could I
escape from the fire in the eyes of him who is to me in place of God?
Come now, shall I prove to thee that my husband has done no harm but
rather good? Dost thou not know that women are like leaves, and love is
like the wind, that blows hither and thither among the trees at its own
sweet wayward will. And to every tree it comes and shakes the leaves.
And some fall on the instant, while others remain fixed for a little
time upon the bough: but sooner or later all are doomed to fall, save
only those which unkind fate keeps unnaturally fastened to wither and
decay upon the tree. For whether they fall or do not fall, they cannot
escape the common inevitable end. So what is gained by the leaf that
remains upon the tree? Were it not best to yield and fall, when wooed by
a breeze loaded with the fragrance of sandal from the mount of Malaya,
than wait to be torn, willy-nilly, from the bough by an overbearing
ungentlemanly blast? Now show me if thou canst a man more worthy to be
my own or any other woman's husband than is he who stole me from my
tree: for I have seen innumerable men as I looked from my window,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

and never any one to be compared with him. For he is strong and I am
weak: and he is brave and I am timid: and a king was his father, and so
is mine: and he is beautiful, and I can read in all men's eyes as well
as thine that I am too, For beauty shakes the heart of whosoever sees
it, whether man or woman, and uproots it, and if it is very powerful
snaps like cotton threads all the fibres that fixed it to its ancient
soil, and carries it away, as his did mine. And so the heart of a woman
is blown about and carried along by her husband, wherever he may choose
to take her. And they who would have it otherwise are not pundits in the
mystery of life. For my heart lay buried in utter darkness, like the
earth at night: and there came in my husband at the window, like the sun
at dawn: and in a moment I was full of the red delight of love. And now
my soul is his by right, for all that now it is, is due to him: and its
colour and its gladness are only the reflection and the consequence of
him. Take him away, and all would disappear. And wilt thou blame the
sun, for turning black night to rosy dawn?
