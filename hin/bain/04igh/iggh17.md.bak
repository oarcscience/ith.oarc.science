### XIV. Love the Fisherman

<span class="smallcaps">Then</span> said Indra: O lady of limbs that are
shaped like serpents sweeping and winding in curving coils, thy words
are prophetic, and thy own dream is likely to prove but a short one,
with a bitter awakening even in this life. What if this husband of thine
should have left thee already, never to return?

Then Wanawallarí said with a smile: O Brahman, hast thou never seen a
man of the *caste* of fishermen, fishing for little fishes in the water
of Ganges? Once they have swallowed the bait, they cannot escape, being
held fast by the cord. And then being caught, they are roasted by their
captor at the flame of a fire, and devoured. Dost thou not know that the
God of love has a fish for the sign on his

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

banner? And why, save that he is himself a fisherman, who fishes for the
hearts of men, using women for his bait? And so only last night he
fished for my husband, and caught him, using me for his lure, and now
the fish can no longer escape. For he has swallowed the bait, and the
cord of no fisherman was ever so strong as that by which my husband is
held by that Master Fisher, Love. For such is the cunning of that god,
that so far from shunning the fire at which he cooks them, his fishy
victims bask and rejoice in it: and the longer my husband has been away
from me, the more and more certain his return, and the more intolerable
to himself his absence. For now he resembles one frozen with the ice and
snow of the Himalaya mountain, and very soon he will utterly perish,
unless he comes back to warm his cold heart at the flame which Love
keeps ever burning in my own. For know, that the heart of a loyal wife
is the altar of Love, on which the sacred household fire ever burns. And
it shines out in the darkness, to guide the travelling husband home: and
in his absence, its pure beam on the black night resembles the streak
made by gold on the dark touchstone of fidelity. And no fire goes out
while there is still fuel to feed it: and mine is not yet utterly
exhausted. Nor

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

was I so foolish as to let my husband leave me, without a security for
his return. For know, O Brahman, that of all the Creator's creatures,
there are only two that do not require to hunt for their legitimate
prey, but wait quietly while it rushes to destruction in their toils of
its own accord. And of these, one is a spider <span
