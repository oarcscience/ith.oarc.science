### III. Water-Lily

<span class="smallcaps">But</span> in the meanwhile, the gods <span
id="fr_17"></span>[i](#fn_17.md) were aware of what had occurred. For they
had heard the abuse that Ranga showered upon them in his despair. And
when they saw that by the assistance of <span
class="smallcaps">Water-lily</span> he had obtained Wanawallarí for his
wife, they were very angry both with the goddess and with him. And they
met in Indra's hall, to discuss the matter and determine what was to be
done. But I was not there, for I bore no grudge against Ranga, knowing
his youth and the provocation which had occasioned his outburst, and
forgiving it. And Nárayana <span id="fr_18"></span>[j](#fn_18.md) also was
absent, for so far from being angry with Ranga, he was pleased with him
for heaping praises on his wife, who is a part of himself,

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

as thou art of me <span id="fr_19"></span>[k](#fn_19.md). So having met,
they said indignantly to one another: This alone would be scandalous and
intolerable, that a mortal should insolently load us with abuse for not
being at his beck and call as if we were nothing but the slaves of our
worshippers. But worse than all, here has <span
class="smallcaps">Water-lily</span> actually rewarded the rascal, by
giving him the most beautiful woman in the three worlds for a wife: so
that instead of being punished for his bad behaviour, he has actually
received a prize. And if this continues, we are wholly undone, and the
established constitution of the universe will be destroyed. For it all
depends on praise, worship and sacrifice <span
id="fr_20"></span>[l](#fn_20.md): but if men get our favours without these,
who will be at the pains of propitiating us at all? Thus though the
conduct of this mortal is bad, that of <span
class="smallcaps">Water-lily</span> is infinitely worse. For she has
taken the part of a mortal, siding against the gods, merely because she
was caught by the cunning fellow's flattery.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Then <span class="smallcaps">Water-lily</span> laughed, looking at them
all askance out of the corner of her long eyes that reached nearly to
her ears. And she said: Surely I have done little worthy of blame, if I
have rewarded my worshipper for his praises, as all you ought long ago
to have done before. For if we pay no attention to them, these mortals
will leave us and laugh at us, and then we shall perish for want of our
proper sustenance. And so it is not I, but rather you yourselves, that
are to blame for leaving him alone. Moreover, after all, he is quite
right in considering my power and divinity as stronger than all others,
for so in fact it is.

But hearing her words, the gods were enraged, and exclaimed: Fie! fie!
And they determined to show her that she was mistaken, and punish her
protégé: and they arranged that Indra should descend to the earth, and
find him, and make an example of him. But that crafty <span
class="smallcaps">Water-lily</span> said to herself: Now will I show all
these foolish gods, and especially Indra, that beauty and fortune are
enemies hard even for gods to overcome. And she played the hypocrite,
and said to them, with an illusive smile on her beautiful lips: When a
fault has been committed, it is for the guilty person to make
reparation. Let Indra go down: but I will myself help to bring the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

sinner to justice and undo my own mischief, by causing the King to
discover the whereabouts of Ranga and his wife.

Then the gods were pleased, for she threw them all off their guard by
her apparent submission. And they said: She is very young, and moreover,
she is a woman, and doubtless she was caught by this rascal's beauty of
person, and his flattery: but now she has changed her mind, which is
variable as the sea out of which she arose, So we must not be angry with
her.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_17"></span>[24:i](iggh06.htm#fr_17.md) When the gods are
spoken of collectively they are generally understood not to include the
great gods, Brahma, Wishnu and Shiwa, each of whom has a claim to be
considered the greatest.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[24:j](iggh06.htm#fr_18.md) Wishnu, of whom
Water-Lily is the wife.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[25:k](iggh06.htm#fr_19.md) Maheshwara is speaking
to his wife.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[25:l](iggh06.htm#fr_20.md) Plato's idea, that the
relation between gods and men is one of commercial reciprocity
(ἐμπορικὴ) is precisely that of the Hindoos, who lay it down in a
hundred places as the essence of the *stithi*, or established
constitution of things.
