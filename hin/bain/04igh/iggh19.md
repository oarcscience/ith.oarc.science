### XVI. A God abashed

<span class="smallcaps">Then</span> said Indra: O lady of swelling bosom
and lofty soul, though thy husband has found in thee a jewel through no
merit of his own, still thou canst not deny that he is a scorner of the
gods, and therefore doomed to bring himself and thee also into disaster
arising from their anger.

Then Wanawallarí rose up and stood before him. And she crossed her hands
over her bosom, and lowered her long dark lashes over her eyes. And she
said: Brahman, now I am a wife, and it may be shall soon be a mother,
and many things I know now that yesterday were unknown to me. And now,
let me ask thee a question. If I should have a son, and if, when he grew
to be a man, in a moment of forgetfulness and anger due to evil fortune
he should curse me as the author of his

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

misery: tell me, what would be my duty? Should I abandon and forsake
him; or should I not rather forgive and condone his offence, considering
it rather as the outcome of a moment of passion than the deliberate act
of a hardened ill-doer?

And she raised her lashes, and looked at him with clear irrefutable eyes
that penetrated his soul, and waited for him to reply. And Indra was
abashed before her, and could not meet her glance. And he struck his
hands together, and exclaimed: O woman and wife, subtle-witted and
silver-tongued, whose incomparable beauty is rendered irresistible by
the soft love-light in thy young bride's eyes, I am conquered by thee,
and thy husband is blest in thee: and well is it said, that a virtuous
woman is higher than the gods. Know, that I came to punish thy husband,
but thou hast redeemed him, and stood between him and the wrath of
heaven. Take thy husband and lead him into the good path, which is thy
own, and save him, if thou canst, from thy father's vengeance, as now
from mine.

And instantly he vanished from before her eyes, and flew up into the
sky. And <span class="smallcaps">Water-lily</span> saw him go: and she
looked after him with triumph in her almond eyes, and laughter on her
vermilion

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

lips. But Wanawallarí started, when she saw that illusive Brahman
disappear. And she drew her breath, and stood, like a startled fawn,
with wondering eyes and moving breast, while the colour came and went
upon her cheek. And then she said to herself: It was as I thought, and
that old Brahman was some deity, descending in a mortal form to try me.
For his eyelids never moved <span id="fr_32"></span>[z](#fn_32.md), and his
body cast no shadow, and he knew all that had occurred to us as no
mortal could have known it. But now, let me remember his words, and
stand, if I can, between my husband and my father's anger. And as she
spoke, she looked, and saw her husband coming quickly towards her along
the street.
