The Indian Stories of Francis William Bain (b. 1863, d. 1940) were
published early in the 20th century. They purport to be translations of
unidentified manuscripts. However, these books are not *directly*
derived from Hindu texts or traditions. Bain was eventually unveiled as
a writer of orientalist fantasies, but by that time he had a loyal
readership who could care less. He continued to press on with the series
until there were thirteen volumes. This is thus a harmless literary hoax
on a par with [Bilitis](../../cla/sob/index). Which is not to say that
these books don't have their charm, particularly if you like [early
fantasy writers](../../ring/index), such as William Morris or Lord
Dunsany. Just don't use them as sources for information about Hindu
mythology.

We are in the process of preparing etexts of all of these books.
However, there is no particular schedule for completing them. The
volumes in this series are as follows:
