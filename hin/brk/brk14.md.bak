of intellect; and when it had risen to the rank of a cosmic Force, it
retained this character. It is the universal subject of thought; but as
it is itself the universe, and there is nothing beside, it is also its
own object, like the Aristotelian νόησις νοήσεως; and as it is above the
conditions of space, time, and causality, we can say of it only that it
*exists,* and is *Thought.*

Frequently, from the natural tendency to conceive a higher sphere of
existence as a realm of light and thought as itself light, Brahma and
the individual Self identified with it are described as supreme
self-luminous light: B.A. IV. iv. 16, Ch. VIII. iii. 4, XII. 3, Kaṭh. v.
15, Śvet. VI. 14.
