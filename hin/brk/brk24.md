§ 21. <span class="smallcaps">Freedom of Will</span>.—It follows that in
so far as man shares in the empiric world his whole moral and physical
life is at every instant strictly predestined. But at the same time his
Self is implicitly free, inasmuch as in essence it is one with the
Absolute Brahma, no matter how it be empirically sunk in the phenomenal
world; and as soon as he attains the knowledge of this fundamental unity
which is itself salvation, his freedom is complete; he is the One
Absolute Brahma, and beside him there exists no empiric world. <span
