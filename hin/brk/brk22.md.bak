§ 19. <span class="smallcaps">The Subtle Body</span>.—According to the
later Vedānta, the Soul in its wanderings from birth to birth is
accompanied by the sense-organs and "breaths" as sums of potential
faculties, and has for its vehicle the "subtle body," *sūkshmaśarīra.*
The latter consists of portions of the five elements in their higher
suprasensual form, and thus is as it were a seed which on occasion grows
by the accession of gross matter into a physical body.

There is no clear evidence for the existence of

this idea in the Upanishads until the mention of a *linga* (the term
used in the Sānkhya school for "subtle body") in B.A. IV. iv. 6; cf.
Kaṭh. VI. 8, Śvet. VI. 9, Maitr. VI. 10. For Śankara's view see
especially on Brahma-sūtra, III. i. 1 f., IV. ii. 6 f. The "subtle body"
adheres to the soul until it attains perfect enlightenment and release
in Brahma; the souls which never reach this goal are always attended by
it.
