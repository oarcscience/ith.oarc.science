**APPENDIX I**

### THE SAMBANDHAS

The 25th and 26th verses of the Advaitamakaranda given above refer to a
topic of importance in the later Vedānta, viz. the logical relation
*(sambandha)* of terms. The relations are three: (1) "common reference,"
*sāmānādhikaraṇya,* (2) "relation as predicate *(viśeshaṇa)* and subject
*(viśeshya),*" and (3)"relation as indicated *(lakshya)* and indicative
term *(lakshaṇā)*." The proposition "Thou art That," *tat tvam asi,*
which is the keynote of the Vedānta (see p. 24), comes under all these
categories. The term *That* denotes literally the whole aggregate of
Ignorances together with the omniscient cosmic consciousness
"determined" by the latter and with the transcendental consciousness
(see p. 30); but by "indication" or metonymy *(lakshaṇā)* it signifies
only the transcendental consciousness. The term *Thou* literally denotes
the aggregate of Ignorances conceived distributively (see p. 30 f.)
together with limited individual consciousness "determined" by the

latter, and with unlimited consciousness; and by "indication" it
signifies only the last. Now the proposition *Thou art That* comes under
the relation of "common reference"; for both *Thou* and *That* signify
*Consciousness* (Brahma), in the former case as transcending perception,
in the latter case as manifested to perception in the form of finite
distinction. Again, these terms are related as subject and predicate,
that is, they are identified in thought by abstraction of their
difference (their difference lying in the fact that the one transcends
perception, and the other does not). Lastly, these terms have a
metonymic relation. When we have abstracted the difference already
mentioned, we may use both to signify the Consciousness, *That* being
the "indicated" and *Thou* the "indicative" term. In the same way the
three several terms *Being, Thought*, and *Bliss,* after due abstraction
of difference (namely phenomenal distinctions) designate "indicatively"
the single indivisible Brahma essentially characterised by infinite
being, thought, and bliss. For further details of the Hindu theories on
these subjects see Vedānta-sāra, Jacob's translation, p. 83 f.,
Athalye's notes on Tarka-sangraha, § 59, Kāvyaprakāśa, ch. ii., etc.
