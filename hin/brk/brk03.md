### INTRODUCTION

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> following pages sketch in outline—and
therefore inadequately—the most important elements in the series of
ideas which, under the general name of *Vedānta*, have been in one form
or another the basis of all Indian thought worthy of the name. No
attempt is made here either to justify or to refute them. Their
philosophic weakness is obvious; no less patent is the intensity of the
longing for an intellectual resting-place, a "Rock of Ages," which has
driven millions of the most thoughtful Hindus to drown their soul's
disquiet in the utterly blank abstraction of "Brahma."

In the main the Vedānta agrees with the teaching of Parmenides and the
early Eleatics of his school, and has many points of contact with
Plato's idealism. But whereas the Greek philosophers were only
professors, the Vedānta has always had a deep practical significance.
Like the early Christian Church, it preached as highest consummation the
renunciation of the world and

of self, passing in some of its phases into a religious self-surrender
fully equal in completeness, if not superior, to that of European
monasticism; and even as a purely intellectual force it has had an
incalculable influence upon the minds and characters of millions of
Hindus in nearly every station of civilised life. To discuss this issue
is beyond the province of our book; it must suffice to point to it.
