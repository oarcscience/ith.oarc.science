§ 23. <span class="smallcaps">Brahma the Destroyer</span>.—As we saw,
the Upanishads are full of cosmogonies inherited from Vedic religion;
but apparently they have not yet arrived at the belief in a periodical
course of alternate creation, maintenance, and dissolution of worlds
which later became general in India. The earlier texts several times
describe Brahma or some cognate power as consuming his creatures
separately; but a collective destruction is nowhere mentioned in
them. <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)

In the later Vedānta the theory of periodical cataclysms is formally
accepted. Again and again the universe is created, and after a time
dissolved again into indiscrete potentiality; this cycle of birth and
death is without beginning and

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

without end (§ 12). In the intervals between destruction and the
following creation the eternal Veda, with its Brāhmaṇas and Upanishads,
rests as a potential force in the thought of Brahma; and at the
beginning of creation the ideas contained in it serve as archetypes for
the formation of all phenomena in the now emerging universe, and are
revealed to inspired sages, its *karma-kāṇḍa* or practical section (the
four Vedas and the bulk of the Brāhmaṇas) to guide men to ritual and
consequent worldly welfare, its *jnāna-kāṇḍa* or theoretical section
(chiefly the Upanishads) to teach them the true knowledge of Brahma.
