§ 17. <span class="smallcaps">Relation of Universal to Individual
Soul</span>.—It is a first principle of the Upanishads that the
numberless individual souls are really one with the Universal Self. But
how is this relation conceivable? To this question no answer is
vouchsafed. The older texts instead give us

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

cosmogonic myths, which realistically depict a Universal Spirit creating
the phenomenal world and then animating it as world-soul; and the latter
they simply identify with the self of the individual, sometimes more
pantheistically (Ch. VI. iii.), sometimes more idealistically (B.A.II.
iv. 5, III. iv. 1, v. 1, etc.). But why should there be this division
between the one Absolute Soul and the innumerable individual souls
condemned to suffer the intellectual darkness and physical sorrows of
embodied life? The Upanishads find a solution in their theory of
*karma,* the acts done in previous births requiring further embodiment
to work away their influence upon the soul. This implies a *regressus ad
infinitum,* as every act is the resultant of a former act; and this
conclusion is cheerfully drawn by the later Vedānta, which thus avoids
the necessity of explaining the "origin of evil." The older Upanishads,
whose cosmogonies contradict this theory, simply avoid the question.

The theory which begins to appear in a somewhat late Upanishad (the
Maitrāyaṇīya), that the Soul conceives division and plurality in
consequence of the delusive attractions of physical Nature, and hence
assumes embodied form and comes under the influence of "works," is
partly connected with the dualism of the Sānkhya school, and partly with
the theory of "illusion" developed in the later Vedānta (see § 16).
Śankara generally regards the universe itself, i.e. the

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

aggregate of subjects and objects of experience, as created in order to
furnish finite souls with experiences in recompense of previous "works";
but the reason moving the Supreme Brahma to render himself an efficient
and material cause of a universe distinct from himself, says Śankara,
can only be motiveless *sport* (see commentary on Brahma-sūtra, II. i.
33).
