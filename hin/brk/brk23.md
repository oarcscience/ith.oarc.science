Heritage

§ 20. <span class="smallcaps">Karma</span>.—The propelling force which
conducts the Soul with its potential functions through endless
incarnations as man, god, beast, or vegetable, is the *karmāśraya,* the
substrate of its *karma* or works. By "work" is understood not only
every act of will, and of body in obedience to will, but also every act
of ideation in which the subject of thought posits a non-self in
opposition to itself, for in this false duality begins the Will, desire,
attachment of the soul to its fetters of finitude, and therewith moral
blindness. Every such act transforms itself into a positive force acting
upon the soul, and demanding a corresponding requital of good for good
and evil for evil in future experiences; and the sum of these forces at
the end of each life determines the form of birth in the next
incarnation. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)
