#### XVI. <span class="smallcaps">The Advaita-Makaranda of Lakshmīdhara</span> <span id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_74.md)

1\. Homage to Kṛishṇa of infinite bliss, the incarnate blessing of the
world, who by the sunbeams

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

of his glances evaporates the ocean of delusion!

2\. Always I <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md) am, I give light; never
am I unbeloved; thus I am proved to be Brahma, consisting in Being,
Thought, and Bliss.

3\. In me, the sky of Thought, arises the mirage of the universe <span
id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76.md); then how can I be aught but Brahma,
knowing all, cause of all?

4\. Destruction cannot come upon me from myself, because of my
recognition; nor from anything else, for I have no parts; nor from the
destruction of an \[external\] basis, for I have no such basis. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[3](#fn_77.md)

5\. I, the ether of Thought, cannot be dried, burned, soaked, or cut
even by real wind, fire, water, or weapons, much less by imaginary
ones. <span id="fr_78"></span>[4](#fn_78.md)

6\. The universe, having no light of its own,

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

could not possibly come to light but for the presence of light; I am the
Light, and therefore am everywhere. <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)

7\. Without manifestation there can be no Being, without consciousness
there can be no manifestation of the unconscious, and without
transference there can be no union with consciousness. Thus I have none
beside me. <span id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_80.md)

8\. I am not body, nor organ of sense, nor vital function, nor mind, nor
intelligence; for they are embraced by the idea of "mine" and are a
playground for the conception of "this." <span
id="fr_81"></span>[3](#fn_81.md)

9\. I am the Witness, related to all things, most

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

dear; I am never the Ego, for that is plunged in affections,
limitations, and pains. <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md)

10\. When the Ego is \[dreamlessly\] slumbering, sorrow, guilt, and
activity do not appear; thus it is he who wanders, not I, who am the
wanderer's witness. <span id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_83.md)

11\. The sleeper <span id="fr_84"></span>[3](#fn_84.md) knows not his
sleeping; in him who sleeps not there is no dreaming and no waking. I am
the Witness of waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep, and thus am not
under these conditions.

12\. \[Dreamless\] sleep is a halting of \[finite\] understanding,
dreaming and waking are the rise thereof; how can these three exist in
me, who am the Witness of them and infinite of knowledge?

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

13\. I am the one who knows the beings of sixfold change, <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_85.md) and myself changeless; were it not so, I
should be altogether incapable of observing their changes.

14\. For a changing thing goes again and again through birth and
dissolution in this and that form; how can it be an observer of these
\[changes\]?

15\. Nor can any one behold his own birth and destruction; for these are
\[respectively\] the last and first moments of antecedent and subsequent
non-being. <span id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_86.md)

16\. How can the not-Light touch the Self which is Light itself, and by
whose light alone are caused the words, "I give not light"? <span
id="fr_87"></span>[3](#fn_87.md)

17\. Nevertheless there is apparent in the sky

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

of Thought a certain mist which subsists on the lack of reflection and
ends with the rise of the sun of reflection. <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md)

18\. In this long-drawn dream of which our world is made, and which
arises from the great slumber of Self-ignorance, there appear Heaven,
Salvation, and the other phantoms. <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_89.md)

19\. This distinction between unconscious and conscious being is
imaginarily imposed on me, the conscious being, like the distinction
between moving and motionless figures in a picture on a level wall.

20\. Even my Witnesshood is unreal, is but a colouring reflected from
the objects of thought; it merely suggests the billowless ocean of
Thought. <span id="fr_90"></span>[3](#fn_90.md)

21\. I, the ocean of ambrosia, decay not because phantom bubbles arise;
I, the mountain of crystal, am not flushed by the play of
dream-fashioned evening clouds. <span id="fr_91"></span>[4](#fn_91.md)

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

22\. *Being* is my very essence, not a property, like ether's being; for
as there is no Being save me, no class-concept \[of Being\] can be
allowed. <span id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92.md)

23\. *Knowledge* is my very essence, not a quality; if it were a
quality, \[Soul\] would be if intelligible not-Self, and if
unintelligible non-being. <span id="fr_93"></span>[2](#fn_93.md)

24\. *Bliss* am I, which is naught else \[but me\]; were it aught else,
it would not be bliss; for if not subordinate to me, it would not be
agreeable, and if subordinate, it could not be of itself agreeable.

25\. No real thing forsooth can ever be of diverse essences; thus I am
without inward distinction, void of the differences arising from the
world.

26\. By the words "That art thou" is indicated a Power of single
essence, pure by the absence of the variety \[consisting in\] the
transcendence \[of

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

the Supreme\] and the distinction \[of individual souls\]. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94.md)

27\. I am the Power self-authoritative and absolute, in which are
stilled the phantom figures of the world and separate souls, of
disciples and masters.

28\. May this "Nectar of Monism" of the poet Lakshmīdhara, gathered from
the autumnal lotuses of poesy, be drunk by the scholar-bees.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_72"></span>[101:1](brk43.htm#fr_72.md) See above, § 4.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[101:2](brk43.htm#fr_73.md) The light of the sun;
Ṛig-veda, III. lxii. 10

<span id="fn_74"></span>[101:3](brk44.htm#fr_74.md) This is a somewhat
modern poem, which is here added as it conveys with great clearness the
leading psychological doctrines of the later Vedānt.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[102:1](brk44.htm#fr_75.md) Throughout this little
work the pronoun "I" is used to denote the individual soul as witness of
the sense of personality, (*ahaṃ-kāra,* egoity), and the other
"determinations" of soul, while itself it consciously transcends them.
The verse means that as the same predicates—existence, thought, and
agreeableness—apply both to the soul and to Brahma, these two are
identical.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[102:2](brk44.htm#fr_76.md) See above, § 16.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[102:3](brk44.htm#fr_77.md) The soul is eternal;
for it cannot be destroyed from within, since it has self-recognition,
i.e. continuous consciousness of self-identity; and it cannot be
destroyed from without, for as it has no parts it cannot be dissolved
into its parts; and as it is dependent upon nothing but itself it cannot
suffer from the destruction of its basis.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[102:4](brk44.htm#fr_78.md) The physical elements,
which seem real, are in truth imaginary.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[103:1](brk44.htm#fr_79.md) In the process of
cognition, according to the Vedānta, there are two elements—viz. the
object or matter of the cognition and the subject of it. The former,
being wholly lifeless and inert, can only emerge into consciousness when
the light of subject Thought falls upon it from without. The first word
of this verse, *abhā-rūpasya,* is wrongly printed *ābhārūpasya* and
accordingly mistranslated in the "Pandit" of 1873, pp. 11, 130.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[103:2](brk44.htm#fr_80.md) No object exists unless
it becomes cognised—i.e. it becomes the object of a subject conscious
thereof. Thus conscious being enters into relation with unconscious
being; and how is this possible? It can only be explained by assuming an
*adhyāsa* or "transference," an inveterate error of the individual
consciousness making it identify itself with the phenomenal world, which
is properly nothing more than an unreal emanation of the consciousness.
Hence there exists in reality nothing but consciousness. See Śankara on
Brahma-sūtra, i. 1.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[103:3](brk44.htm#fr_81.md) The sense-organs
*(indriya)*, vital functions *(prāṇa)*, sensorium *(manas)*, and
intelligence *(dhī,* i.e. *buddhi)*, are only "determinants," *upādhis,*
external to the soul; see p. 28 f.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[104:1](brk44.htm#fr_82.md) The "witness" is the
consciousness impassively cognising the affections of the psychical
*upādhis,* such as love or hate. It is "related to all things," for
things exist only in so far as they are objects of thought (see v. 7).
It is thus universal Being, Thought, and Bliss. On the error of
confusing the absolute Self with the Ego, see p. 45. The Ego
*(ahaṃ-kāra)* is really the subject of dreaming and dreamless sleep and
waking, not the transcendental Self, according to the later, Vedānta.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[104:2](brk44.htm#fr_83.md) In deep sleep or swoons
the Ego or sense of personality disappears and with it disappear its
resultant activities and affections; hence the *saṃsāra,* or continuance
of rebirth, which consists essentially of these activities, cannot
co-exist with the absence of the Ego, i.e. with the condition of
abstract impersonal self-consciousness.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[104:3](brk44.htm#fr_84.md) The Ego, or sense of
personality, which in dreamless sleep is unconscious that it is
sleeping. On the other hand the transcendental Soul or Self is
everlastingly conscious; it is the "Witness" of the three states.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[105:1](brk44.htm#fr_85.md) The six changes of
finite being are origin, continuance, increase, attainment of maturity,
commencement of decay, and dissolution. As subject of the cognition of
these phenomena, the Soul must be itself devoid of these properties.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[105:2](brk44.htm#fr_86.md) If the Soul were liable
to changes, it would be conscious of its changes, which is not the case
(verse 14). Every change of a thing implies destruction of its previous
condition; hence, even if we could imagine soul as passing through the
six changes, we should have to admit that when it is in a particular
state it cannot as such be conscious of itself at the beginning of that
state (which is the last moment of the previous state), nor can it be
conscious of itself at the end of that state (which is the first moment
of the next state).

<span id="fn_87"></span>[105:3](brk44.htm#fr_87.md) The illusion of a
phenomenal world cannot be in any real connection with the pure
consciousness of the absolute Soul; for the conception of a physical
world opposed to thought is essentially a partial negation of
consciousness by consciousness, and nothing more.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[106:1](brk44.htm#fr_88.md) The illusion of the
phenomenal world, which falsely appears as really existent, until its
unreality is proved by "reflection."

<span id="fn_89"></span>[106:2](brk44.htm#fr_89.md) Even salvation, or
release of the Soul *(moksha)*, is only real from the standpoint of
empiric thought. The transcendent Self is never in bondage, and
therefore is never released.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[106:3](brk44.htm#fr_90.md) Since the objects of
finite Thought are strictly unreal, there cannot be a *real*
consciousness of them in the real Self. The function of witness of
phenomena which apparently is exercised by the Self is really a mere
indication of the absolute supra-phenomenal immobility of consciousness
which is characteristic of the real Self.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[106:4](brk44.htm#fr_91.md) The essential nature of
the Soul is in no way affected by<span id="page_107">p. 107</span> the
emergence from it of an imaginary universe, nor by the false idea,
reflected upon it from the illusory universe without, that it is a
subject or object of action, etc.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[107:1](brk44.htm#fr_92.md) We must not say that
"existence" is only a property or attribute of the Soul. For an
attribute is a generic concept implying more than one individual in
which it resides; but in the case of Soul there is only one individual,
the Soul itself, in which resides the attribute "existence," in the same
way as in the phenomenal world there is only one ether, or space, in
which therefore "etherhood" is essence, not attribute.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[107:2](brk44.htm#fr_93.md) If the Self is an
object to its assumed property of knowledge, it is no longer Self; for
the object of knowledge cannot be identical with the subject (which here
is the property of knowledge). If again the Self is not an object of its
know ledge, the Self is non-existent; for the incogitable is unreal.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[108:1](brk44.htm#fr_94.md) See Appendix I.
