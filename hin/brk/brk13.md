*Brahma Knowledge*, by L. D. Barnett, \[1911\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

§ 10. <span class="smallcaps">Brahma is Absolute Being</span>.—The
question whether the universal substrate, or Brahma, should properly be
called being *(sat)* or non-being *(a-sat)*, already agitated the Vedic
poets (see Ṛig veda, x. cxxix. 1), and passed through the schools of the
Brāhmaṇas to those of the older Upanishads. The debate, however, was
merely over words. As Brahma is beyond all the limiting conditions of
phenomenal being, either term may be applied to it; it is at once
metaphysically existent and empirically non-existent.

Brahma is *non-being,* B.A. II. iii. 1, Ch. III. xix. 1, Taitt. II.
vi.-vii.; *being,* Ch. VI. ii. 1, etc. Brahma is "reality of reality,"
B.A. II. i. 20, iii. 6; "the Eternal cloaked in (empirical) reality," I.
vi. 3. A reconciliation from the transcendental standpoint is found in
Śvet. IV. 18, v. 1, Muṇḍ. II. ii. 1, etc. Śankara (on Brahma-sūtra, I.
iv. 14 f.) rightly notes the twofold meaning of the terms "being" and
"not-being."
