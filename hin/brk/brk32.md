#### IV. <span class="smallcaps">The Infinite I</span> <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18)

"Verily this All is Brahma. It has therein its birth, end, breath; as
such one should worship it in stillness.

Verily man is made of will. As is man's will

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

in this world, such he becomes on going hence; so let him frame the
will.

Made of mind, bodied in breath, shaped in light, real of purpose,
ethereal of soul, all-working, all-desiring, all-smelling, all-tasting,
grasping this All, speaking naught, heeding naught—this is my Self
within my heart, smaller than a rice-corn, or a barley-corn, or a
mustard-seed, or a canary-seed, or the pulp of a canary-seed—this is my
Self within my heart, greater than earth, greater than sky, greater than
heaven, greater than these worlds. All-working, all-desiring,
all-smelling, all-tasting, grasping this All, speaking naught, heeding
naught—this is my Self within my heart, this is Brahma; to Him shall I
win when I go hence. He with whom it is thus has indeed no doubt." Thus
spake Śāṇḍilya.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_17"></span>[63:1](brk31.htm#fr_17) They pass every day into
dreamless sleep, the perfect union with Brahma in the heart; but they
are not conscious of this union, and the condition of their existence
causes it to be only temporary. See above, § 15.

iii. 14.
