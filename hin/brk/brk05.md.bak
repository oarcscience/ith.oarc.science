for the most part merely adaptations of the Ṛig-veda for special
liturgical purposes, while the *Atharva-veda,* which was not admitted
until much later into the Vedic canon, combines Ṛig-vedic hymns selected

philosophic and literary merit. The study of these hymn-collections in
their liturgical application by the Brahman schools bore as fruit the
bulky volumes known generically as *Brāhmaṇas.*
