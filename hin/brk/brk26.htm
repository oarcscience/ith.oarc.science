<p>&sect; 23. <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brahma the Destroyer</span>.&#8212;As we saw, the Upanishads are full of cosmogonies inherited from Vedic religion; but apparently they have not yet arrived at the belief in a periodical course of alternate creation, maintenance, and dissolution of worlds which later became general in India.

In the intervals between destruction and the following creation the eternal Veda, with its Br&#257;hma&#7751;as and Upanishads, rests as a potential force in the thought of Brahma; and at the beginning of creation the ideas contained in it serve as archetypes for the formation of all phenomena in the now emerging universe, and are revealed to inspired sages, its <i>karma-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</i> or practical section (the four Vedas and the bulk of the Br&#257;hma&#7751;as) to guide men to ritual and consequent worldly welfare, its <i>jn&#257;na-k&#257;&#7751;&#7693;a</i> or theoretical section (chiefly the Upanishads) to teach them the true knowledge of Brahma.</p>
