§ 4. <span class="smallcaps">Foundations of Upanishadic
Ideas</span>.—The Ṛig-veda contains many strata of religious and
philosophic thought. Its oldest element is a worship of nature-deities,
such as the Sky-Father, Earth-Mother, Dawn, etc., who were inherited
from the time before the division of the Indo-European stocks. These
figures, however, are not as a rule living forces in religion; for the
most part they are kept alive merely by conservatism and poetic
convention. The most real gods of the Vedic pantheon are peculiarly
Indian. Often indeed a distant connection can be traced between them and
nature-deities in the other Indo-European races; but their myths and

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

legends have undergone a long process of development on Indian soil, by
which they have acquired the characteristic stamp of the Hindu genius.
But even in the naturalistic polytheism of this mythology we can trace
in the Ṛig-veda, especially in its later parts, a tendency towards a
pantheism merging all being into a Supreme Spirit of vaguely defined
character, a primal Infinite.

Thus "there is one Existence, sages call it by many names" (Ṛig-veda, I.
clxiv. 46; cf. x. cxiv. 5). The primitive spirit and source of being is
called *Hiraṇya-garbha* ("Germ of Gold"), or Prajā-pati ("Lord of
Creatures"), x. cxxi.; as his own firstborn he enters the universe
created by him (x. lxxii., lxxxii., etc.). In x. cxxix. the first Being
is neither existent nor non-existent, a watery void, from which arose a
primal Unity, whence sprang Desire as first bond between being and
non-being. Another poet (x. xc.) tells how the universe arose from
*Purusha,* "Man," that is, an ideal human sacrifice offered by the gods.
For as, to the Vedic mind, a sacrifice is a power controlling Nature,
and the human sacrifice is the most powerful of all, then the greatest
of all forces, the cosmogonic energies, must have arisen from an ideal
offering of this kind made by the highest agents, the gods.

To the demand of philosophy for a final and absolute Reality beyond the
temporary and merely relative reality of phenomenal experience

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

the Vedic poets thus gave almost the same answer as the early Greek
thinkers. They asserted, in very diverse and often very mystic terms,
the existence of a single cosmic matter or World-Spirit, whom they
styled variously *Prajā-pati, Brahmā* (masculine), *Purusha,
Hiraṇaya-garbha,* etc.
