#### V. <span class="smallcaps">Know Thy Self</span> <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19)

The world then was not yet unfolded. It became unfolded in Name and
Shape, so that one might say, "He of this or that name is of this or
that shape." So even now it becomes unfolded in Name and Shape, so that
one may say, "He of this or that name is of this or that shape."
He <span id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20) passed into it up to the
nail-tips, as a razor might

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

be laid in a razor-case or the All-Supporter <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21) in the All-Supporter's nest. They see Him
not; for He is divided. As breathing, He is called Breath; as speaking,
Speech; as seeing, Sight; as hearing, Hearing; as thinking, Mind; these
are the names for his workings. A man who worships one or another
thereof understands not; for He is but in division as one or another
thereof. So He should be worshipped as the Self; for therein do all
these become one.

This Self is the track of the universe, for by it is the universe known,
yea, as a thing may be followed up by its track. Fame and praise a man
finds who has such knowledge.

This Self is dearer than a son, dearer than substance, dearer than all
beside, more inward. If of a man who calls another than the Self dear it
should be said that he will lose his darling, it may well come to pass.
He should worship the Self only as darling; for him who worships the
Self as darling his darling perishes not.

They say: "Seeing that men deem that by knowledge of Brahma they shall
become the universe, what did Brahma know that He became the universe?"

The world forsooth was in the beginning Brahma. It knew *itself,* "I am
Brahma"; therefore it became the universe. And whosoever of the gods
understood this also became the same;

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

likewise of sages and of men. Seeing this, the sage Vāmadeva set it
forth, saying: "I have become Manu and the Sun." <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](brk34.htm#fn_22) So now likewise he who knows "I
am Brahma" becomes the universe. The very gods have no power that he
should not be so; for he becomes the Self of them.

Now he who worships another godhead, saying "This is not the same as I,"
understands not; he is as it were a beast belonging to the gods. Even as
many beasts profit a man, so each man profits the gods. It is unpleasing
when one beast is taken away; how much more when many are taken!
Therefore it is not pleasing to them <span
id="fr_23"></span>[2](brk34.htm#fn_23) that men should know this.
