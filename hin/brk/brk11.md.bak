§ 8. <span class="smallcaps">Upanishadic Principles</span>.—These
conceptions,

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

which are conveyed by the Upanishads in very diverse and often mystic
and contradictory utterances, may be summed up in three propositions.
Firstly, the whole of finite or phenomenal being is evolved from an
infinite and unconditioned substrate of absolute reality, *Brahma*.
Secondly, Brahma is pure Thought, absolute Spirit. Thirdly, Brahma is
one with the essential thought of each individual subject of thought,
the Soul or *Ātmā.*

Śankara, in following these principles, lays down a broad distinction
between Brahma as absolute, unqualified, and indeterminate *(nirguṇa)*,
and Brahma as secondary, determined by self-imposed limitations of
space, time, and causality *(saguṇa)*. The former is real, and object of
real knowledge; the latter is essentially unreal, an illusion arising
from the congenital error of the subject of thought, and vanishing away
as soon as the latter by enlightenment ceases to conceive the Absolute
in forms of determinate thought, and realises his essential unity with
it. Thus all objects of thought must be regarded from two standpoints:
the first is that of empiric experience, determined by conditions of
space, time, and causality; the second is transcendental, admitting the
existence of nothing but an absolute unqualified One. Sankara argues
from both standpoints without much regard for consistency. He justifies
the Upanishadic habit of describing Brahma under

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

the qualified forms of empirical thought, or as represented by a symbol,
as a concession to feebler intellects, which cannot comprehend an
abstract and unqualified principle, and are by these representations
induced to worship Brahma in his qualified character, and thereby to
attain freedom from ignorance and sin, worldly welfare, and "gradual
release," *krama-mukti* (see § 25), whereas the true essence of Brahma
is conveyed only by those passages which deny of him all qualification
(see especially his commentary on Ch. VIII. i. and on Brahma-sūtra, I.
iii. 14 f., III. ii. 11 f.).
