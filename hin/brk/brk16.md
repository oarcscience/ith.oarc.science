§ 13. <span class="smallcaps">Brahma is Incogitable</span>.—Brahma or
Ātmā, being an absolute Reality, the supreme Thing-in-Itself, is
therefore inconceivable by the reason, and only capable of being
comprehended by an inspired intuition. The Self, whether universal or
individual, is a single subject of thought, and so cannot be an object
of thought; and it is by nature absolute, above all conditions of finite
determination. This negative conception is most forcibly expressed by
the famous formula ascribed to Yājnavalkya, *neti  neti,* "not so, not
so," a denial of all possible predicates to the Self (B.A. IV. ii. 4,
IV. 22, v. 15, etc.), and also by frequently describing Brahma or Ātmā
in contradictory terms as limitless, infinitely extended and yet
immeasurably limited in space and time, and denying to it all activity
as cause or effect. See also B.A. II. iv. 14, III. iv. 2, vii. 23, viii.
11, Ch. III. xiv. 2, VII. xxiv. 1, Kena. III., XI., Kaṭh. VI. 12 f.
Śankara (on Brahma-sūtra II. iii. 29) explains these contradictions in
the description of the size of the Self by asserting that the mention of
it as immeasurably small refers to its condition as empiric soul, when
it is limited by "determinations" (§ 12) and is conceived under the
attributes of the "determination" of intelligence, *buddh*i (§ 18).

Śankara (on Brahma-sūtra III. ii. 17) tells a tale of a sage who, on
being asked to teach the doctrine of Brahma, remained silent, and on the
request

being thrice repeated said simply, "I have told you, but you understand
not; this Self is still" (cf. Ch. III. xiv. 1).
