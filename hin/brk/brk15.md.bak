Heritage

§ 12. <span class="smallcaps">Brahma is Ātmā</span>.—I.
*Upanishads.*—This idealistic conception became more marked when Brahma
was identified with the *Ātmā,* the subject of individual thought. "The
universe is an Idea, *my* Idea"—this doctrine is constantly preached in
detailed expositions and in pithy phrases like the famous "I am Brahma"
*(aham* *brahmāsmi)*, "thou art that" *(tat tvam asi)*. Hence all
phenomena are known when their substrate Brahma is known as the Self of
the knower.

For *tat tvam asi* see Ch. VI. viii. 7 f.; *aham brahmāsmi,* B.A. I. iv.
10; cf. *tad vai tat,* "truly this is that," B.A. V. iv., *etad vai
tat*, Kaṭh. IV. 3-6. The most adequate treatment of this theme is B.A.
IV. iii.–iv.: the Self is "the Spirit *(Purusha)*

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

made of understanding amid the Breaths, the inward light within the
heart, that travels abroad, remaining the same, through both worlds,"
wandering in waking and dreaming through this world, and in deep sleep
or death through the world of Brahma; in dreams it builds up a fairy
world from the materials of waking thought; in dreamless sleep it is
merged in the "understanding self," *prājna ātmā,* viz. Brahma as
universal subject of thought, without consciousness of objects distinct
from itself (cf. §§ 11, 15,18). Ātmā is pure consciousness, Kau. III f.;
as a purely intellectual force pervading all being, it is compared to
salt dissolved in water, B.A. II. iv. 12, Ch. VI. xiii. Ātmā known, all
is known, Ch. VI. i. f.; the later view of it as impassive spectator of
the subjects, objects, and activity of finite thought, Pra. VI. 5, Śvet.
VI. 11, Sarvopanishatsāra, etc.

Ch. VIII. i. f. lays special emphasis on the presence of the whole
macrocosm, the universal Self, in the heart of man, and hence on the
absolute freedom of him who knows the Self within him. The whole world
of cognitions exists for us only in so far as it enters into the range
of our egoity; our pleasures are only for the satisfaction of our Self,
which is the All; this recognition unites our soul with the universe and
gives us control of all things from their source, B.A. II. iv., IV. v.
The final reality of cognition is infinitude, *bhūmā,*

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

illimitable ideation, on realising which the soul wins absolute freedom,
Ch. VII. xxiii. f.

Very important in this connection is the theory of the Five Selves
propounded in the Taittirīya Upanishad, ii., an attempt to interpret the
phenomena of physical existence in terms of the Ātmā. The author
conceives the first four Selves as sheaths surrounding the fifth. The
first is *anna-maya,* "formed of food"; that is, it comprises the
physical organs of microcosmic and macrocosmic body. Within this is the
second, the *prāṇa-maya,* "formed of life-breaths"; it is the Self as
embodied in the incorporeal functions on which depends the activity of
the gross organs in the microcosm and macrocosm. The third is
*mano-maya,* "formed of will," namely of the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas, which
are the powers inspiring the life of the world for worldly ends, for
they ordain rituals for the carnal benefit of gods and their worshippers
in this and other worlds. The fourth is *vijnāna-maya,* "formed of
understanding," namely that phase of consciousness in which the vanity
of this Vedic ritual is recognised and superseded by an intellectual
worship of Brahma, which however still distinguishes Brahma as object
from the Self as worshipper. Within this is the inmost Self, the
*ānanda-maya,* "formed of bliss," the incogitable spirit of infinite
peace and joy (cf. Ch. IV. x.-xv., where Brahma is essentially space and
joy).

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

II\. *Later Vedānta.*—The triad of attributes often mentioned in the
later Vedānta, Existence, Thought, and Bliss *(sack-chid-ānanda)*, does
not occur as a formula in Śankara's writings; it is however anticipated
by his definition of Brahma as "eternal, omniscient, omnipresent,
eternally satisfied, eternally pure, intelligent, and free of nature,
understanding, and bliss" (on Brahma-sūtra I. i. 4). Brahma is the
omnipotent and omniscient cause of the origin, maintenance, and
dissolution of the universe, the intelligence forming the Self or true
Ego of every being, of which the only possible predicates are absolute
Being and Thought (on I. i. 2, 4, II. iii. 7, III. ii. 21, etc.).

In accordance with his principles, Śankara regards the creation by and
from Brahma from both an esoteric and an exoteric standpoint. On the one
hand, he remarks, the creation of the phenomenal world as described in
terms of empiric thought by the Vedas and Upanishads has no absolute
reality at all; it is intended to teach parabolically that the Self of
all things is Brahma (see commentary on Brahma-sūtra II. i. 33). On the
other hand, the world of experience cannot be ignored altogether; it is
a fact of consciousness, though only of unenlightened consciousness, and
accordingly an explanation of its process must be found. Creation
consists in a division of Brahma by himself into a boundless variety of
"names and forms," intelligible existences

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

which constitute the empiric world and possess determinate principles of
being, formal and material potentialities *(śakti)* that never vary
throughout all the world's successive cycles (see § 23). These potential
forces, which relatively to one another are of infinite variety but
intrinsically are strictly determinate, include not only the germinal
principles of all phenomena but also the empiric souls *(jīva)* as such;
and collectively they constitute the "powers" or *śaktis,* i.e. the
eternal demiurgic potencies of Brahma, which in the intervals between
the creations of the worlds lie dormant in a deep sleep of illusion as a
sum of merely potential energies, waiting for the next creation to arise
in cosmopoeic activity (on I. iii. 30, IV. 9, II, i. 30 f., etc.). Thus
the Upanishadic theory of a single creation is replaced by a doctrine of
beginningless and endless successions of emergence and reabsorption of
the phenomenal world (see § 23).

The force that moves the absolute Idea to conceive itself as a plurality
of determinate subjects and objects of empiric thought is, according to
Śankara, *Ignorance,* which, though itself strictly negative, is the
basis of that positive illusion, the phenomenal world (see § 16).
Ignorance creates "determinations," *upādhi,* modes of thought limiting
the self-conception of the absolute Brahma, and Ignorance causes the
empiric soul thus produced to confuse Brahma with the determinations

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

falsely imposed upon him, so that Brahma is imagined variously as
individual soul, a world of experience, and a personal God.

The "determinations" that play the most important part in Śankara's
system are those which form the structure of individual consciousness by
constituting the idea of an embodied individual soul, *jīva.* These are
the *prāṇas,* or "breaths," the "works," the "subtle body," the gross
body, and sometimes also the sensations and phenomenal perceptions (see
§ 18). A favourite metaphor by which Sankara illustrates his theory of
*upādhis* is that of a jar. The space enclosed within a certain jar is
really the same as the infinite space filling the universe, and the
conception of it as limited by the jar nowise limits the infinitude of
space itself; and so the conception of the Self as determined by the
forms of embodied existence nowise excludes the identity of the embodied
Self with the absolute Brahma. The soul itself, says Śankara (on II.
iii. 40), is totally incapable of (empiric) action, whether as subject
or object; its apparent activity, e.g. in desire, grief, etc., is based
merely upon Ignorance, for the activity arises because the soul falsely
ascribes to itself the properties of "determinations" (cf. the
definitions of the individual soul given on IV. ii. 4 as "the
intelligent self, *vijnānātmā,* having the determinations of ignorance,
works, and previous experience").

The Vedantic schools which followed Śankara

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

theorised more schematically on the origin of the phenomenal world. They
regard Ignorance as a cosmic sum of forces including all finite powers,
causes, and effects, which has two characteristic properties, viz.
"obscuration" *(āvaraṇa)*, causing the Absolute Idea to conceive itself
as distinct individual egos, and "distention" *(vikshepa)*, arousing in
the Self the illusive idea of an external world of phenomena. Accepting
the Sānkhya's division of matter into the three *guṇas* or modes of
*sattva* ("goodness" or "truth"), *rajas* ("passion"), and *tamas*
("gloom"), they identify matter with Cosmic Ignorance, or the sum of
individual Ignorances, which acts as a "determinant" to the Supreme Self
or Absolute Thought. The latter as "determined" in Cosmic Ignorance acts
as a world-soul, directing the universal order of phenomena with supreme
power and knowledge, and hence is called *Īśvara,* "the Lord." The
Cosmic Ignorance is hence called "Īśvara's body," and also "Deep Sleep"
*(sushupti)*, for in it the force of Ignorance investing Thought is
almost wholly inoperative, and the phenomenal world exists only in
potentiality. This sphere of being is called the "sheath of Bliss,"
*ānanda-maya kośa.* To it corresponds a stage of existence in the
individual soul, in which the Self or Thought (here styled *Prājna*) is
"determined" by individual Ignorance. From Īśvara as "determined" by
Cosmic Ignorance arise the subtle

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

elements (§ 18) and thence both the "subtle bodies" (§ 19) and gross
elements. The "subtle bodies" in the aggregate determine the Self into a
mode called *Prāṇa,* *Sūtrātmā,* or *Hiraṇyagarbha*; individually they
determine it into the mode called *Taijasa.* These combinations of
matter with the Self form three successive phases of being for the
individual soul: (1) the "sheath of understanding," *vijnāna-maya kośa,*
composed of intelligence *(buddhi)* and the "organs of knowledge" (§
18), which constitutes the real *agent* in empiric experience; (2) the
"sheath of mind," *mano-maya kośa,* formed of *manas* and the organs of
action, thus constituting the *instrument* of empiric experience; and
(3) the "sheath of the breaths," *prāṇa-maya kośa,* formed of vital
breaths and organs of action, and constituting the effect of experience.
These three phases of being are together called "Dream-Sleep," as in
them arise the subtle or elementary forms of phenomena and the
reflection of them upon the "determined" Self. The gross elements which
arise from the subtle collectively "determine" the Self into the phase
called *Vaiśvānara* or *Virāt*; individually they "determine" it into
*Viśva*. This lowest determination is called *anna-maya kośa,* the
"sheath of food," or the state of Waking, for into it the forms of both
gross and subtle phenomena are displayed to the Self, as in waking both
memory and sense-perception are active.
