§ 3. <span class="smallcaps">The Upanishads</span>. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)—The earlier Upanishads, a series of
philosophic tracts of varying length and character, arose in the schools
of the Brāhmaṇas, and especially were attached to the sections of the
latter styled *Āraṇyakas.* The Hindus class together Vedas, Brāhmaṇas,
Āraṇyakas, and Upanishads under the general title of "Veda" (knowledge)
or "Revelation" (*śruti,* "hearing").

The Vedas and Brāhmaṇas are the handbooks of a crude naturalistic
ritualism; but the Āraṇyakas ("Forest-books"), apparently intended

for the study of anchorites in the woods, where the more elaborate
liturgies were suspended, deal more with the theory of ritual, chiefly
from an allegorical point of view. Hence they lead over to the earlier
Upanishads, which express a series of generally cognate metaphysical and
psychological ideas, at first by allegorical interpretation of Vedic
ritual and myth, later with increasing independence of method. Their
relation towards Vedic ritualism was at first one of opposition;
preaching the saving grace of knowledge alone, they regarded as
inadequate the actual liturgies, which admittedly aimed only at worldly
welfare. Later their attitude became more conciliatory, and we find them
styling themselves *Vedānta* (first Muṇḍ. III. ii. 6, Śvet. VI. 22).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[12:1](brk06.htm#fr_0.md) The etymology of the word
*Upanishad* is not clear. European scholars generally regard it as from
the root *sad* (compare Latin *sedeo*), so that it would mean "a sitting
before," i.e. a lesson; but native tradition interprets it as "mystery,"
and the enigmatic formulae in which the older Upanishads sometimes
convey their theories lend some support to this view (see Deussen,
*Philosophy of Upanishads,* English translation, pp. 10 ff.).
