#### XIV. <span class="smallcaps">The False and the True</span> <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md)

"The Self, free from evil, ageless, deathless, sorrowless, hungerless,
thirstless, real of desire, real of purpose, this should men inquire
after, yea, should seek to know. All worlds he wins and all desires who
traces out and understands the Self," said Prajā-pati.

Both the gods and the demons marked this. "Come," said they, "let us
seek out this Self by seeking out which one wins all worlds and all
desires." So Indra of the gods and Virochana of the demons set out on a
travel, and without being in compact they both came with faggots

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

in their hands <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md) to Prajā-pati, and
stayed as Brahman-students for two-and-thirty years.

Then said Prajā-pati to them, "What would ye, that ye have stayed?"

And they said, "The Self, free from evil, ageless, deathless,
sorrowless, hungerless, thirstless, real of desire, real of purpose,
this should men inquire after, yea, should seek to know. All worlds he
wins and all desires who traces out and understands this Self. This they
report to be thy saying, sir; in desire thereof have we stayed."

Then Prajā-pati said to them, "The Being <span
id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59.md) who is seen in the eye is the Self"—thus
he spake—"this is the deathless, the fearless; this is Brahma."

"Then who is he, sir, that is discerned in water and in a mirror?"

"It is he that is discerned in all these beings."

"Look upon yourselves in a basin of water," said he, "and tell me what
of yourselves you do not perceive."

They looked in a basin of water; and Prajā-pati said to them, "What see
you?"

"We see in this image the whole of our selves, sir," said they, "even to
our hair and nails."

Then Prajā-pati said to them, "Put on goodly

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

ornament and fine clothing, attire yourselves, and look in the basin of
water."

They put on goodly ornament and fine clothing, attired themselves, and
looked in the basin of water. Prajā-pati said to them, "What see you?"

They said, "Even as we stand here wearing goodly ornament and fine
clothing, and attired, sir, so are we there wearing goodly ornament and
fine clothing, and attired, sir."

"This is the Self," said he, "this is the deathless, the fearless; this
is Brahma."

The twain travelled away content of heart. Gazing after them, Prajā-pati
said: "They are travelling away, yet have they not found and traced out
the Self. They who shall follow this doctrine, be they the gods or the
demons, shall be brought low."

Now Virochana came content of heart to the demons, and declared to them
this doctrine: "The Self <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60.md) should be
gladdened here, the Self should be tended; he that gladdens the Self
here and tends the Self gains both this world and that beyond."
Therefore it is that here even now men say of one who is not bountiful
nor believing nor given to sacrifice, "Fie, a demon!" For this is the
doctrine of the demons; and when one has died men furnish his body with
food and clothing

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

and ornament, imagining that therewith they will win the world beyond.

But Indra, ere he reached the gods, foresaw this peril: "Even as this
\[Self\] <span id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) wears goodly ornament when
this body wears goodly ornament, is finely clothed when it is finely
clothed, and is attired when it is attired, so likewise this \[Self\]
becomes blind when this \[body\] is blind, lame when it is lame, maimed
when it is maimed; yea, it perishes with the perishing of this body. I
see no pleasure herein."

He came back, faggots in hand. Prajā-pati said to him, "Maghavā, as thou
didst depart content of heart with Virochana, what wouldst thou, that
thou hast come back?"

And he said: "Even as this \[Self\], sir, wears goodly ornament when
this body wears goodly ornament, is finely clothed when it is finely
clothed, and is attired when it is attired, so likewise this \[Self\]
becomes blind when this \[body\] is blind, lame when it is lame, maimed
when it is maimed; yea, it perishes with the perishing of this body. I
see no pleasure herein."

"Thus indeed it is, Maghavā," said he; "but I will teach thee yet more
of it. Stay another two-and-thirty years."

He stayed another two-and-thirty years. Then he said to him: "He who
wanders about rejoicing

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

in dreams, <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md) is the Self"—thus he
spake "this is the deathless, the fearless; this is Brahma."

He departed content of heart. But ere he reached the gods, he foresaw
this peril: "This \[Self\] indeed becomes not blind though the body be
blind, nor lame though it be lame, nor is it defiled by the defilement
thereof; it is not stricken by the smiting thereof, nor is it lamed with
the lameness thereof; but nevertheless it is as if it were stricken, as
if it were hustled, as if it were feeling unpleasantness, as if it were
weeping. I see no pleasure herein."

He came back, faggots in hand. Prajā-pati said to him, "Maghavā, as thou
didst depart content of heart, what wouldst thou, that thou hast come
back?"

And he said: "This \[Self\] indeed becomes not blind though the body be
blind, nor lame though it be lame, nor is it defiled by the defilement
thereof; it is not stricken by the smiting thereof, nor is it lamed with
the lameness thereof; but nevertheless it is as if it were stricken, as
if it were hustled, as if it were feeling unpleasantness, as if it were
weeping. I see no pleasure herein."

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

"Thus indeed it is, Maghavā," said he; "but I will teach thee yet more
of it. Stay another two-and-thirty years."

He stayed another two-and-thirty years. Then he said to him: "When one
sleeps utterly and in perfect peace so that he beholds no dream, <span
id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md) this is the Self"—thus he spake—"this is
the deathless, the fearless; this is Brahma."

He departed content of heart. But before he reached the gods, he foresaw
this peril: "Truly one thus <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md) knows no
longer himself as "I am," nor these creatures. He has sunk into
destruction. I see no pleasure herein."

He came back, faggots in hand. Prajā-pati said to him, "Maghavā, as thou
didst depart content of heart, what wouldst thou, that thou hast come
back?"

And he said: "Truly, sir, one thus knows no longer himself as "I am,"
nor these creatures. He has sunk into destruction. I see no pleasure
herein."

"Thus indeed it is, Maghavā," said he; "but I will teach thee yet more
of it; it is nowhere but in this. Stay another five years."

He stayed another five years. These amount to one hundred and one years;
so men say, "Verily Maghavā stayed for one hundred and

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

one years as Brahman-student with Prajā-pati." Then he said to him:
"Verily, Maghavā, this body is mortal, held in the grasp of Death; but
it is the seat of this deathless, bodiless self. <span
id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) The Embodied is held in the grasp of joy
and sorrow; for what is embodied cannot be quit of joy and sorrow. But
joy and sorrow touch not what is unembodied. Unembodied is the wind;
unembodied are the cloud, the lightning, the thunder. As these, rising
up from yonder ether, pass into the Supreme Light and issue forth each
in its own semblance, so likewise this perfect Peace, rising up from
this body, passes into the Supreme Light and issues forth in its own
semblance. This is the Highest Spirit…Now when the eye is fixed upon the
ether,

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

that is the spirit in the eye \[which sees\]; the eye is but a means to
see. When one thinks that he will smell a thing, it is the Self; the
nostril is but a means to smell. When one thinks that he will utter a
word, it is the Self; speech is but a means to utterance. When one
thinks that he will hear a thing, it is the Self; the ear is but a means
to hearing. When one thinks that he will think of a thing, it is the
Self; the mind is his divine eye; with this divine eye he sees these
desires and rejoices therein…All worlds he wins and all desires who
traces out and understands the Self." Thus spake Prajā-pati.

Self, which in dreams is free from the physical afflictions of empiric
existence, but nevertheless is still tormented by the mental concepts of
these. This standpoint is that of realism.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[97:1](brk42.htm#fr_65.md) Prajā-pati, in answer to
Indra's criticism of his last definition of the Self, explains that the
utter unconsciousness of dreamless sleep is not a state of non-being,
but a state of transcendental Being-Consciousness. Finite consciousness
is active in embodied existence, which is attended by sensations of
pleasure and pain. But the finite consciousness of embodied being is but
an illusive phase of the infinite consciousness of unembodied existence,
which is represented by the state of dreamless sleep. The great forces
of cosmic nature are in essence incorporeal; when confined within the
category of space or ether they produce in the macrocosm the phenomena
of a finite universe; but essentially they transcend space, being the
infinite powers of Absolute Being. Similarly in the microcosm the
physical functions which cause the conceptions of individual existence
as subject of empiric thought are really phases of the Absolute
Consciousness, the objectless Subject, essentially transcending
individual existence.
