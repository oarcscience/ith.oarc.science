### AN ACCOUNT OF THE VEDĀNTA

§ 1. <span class="smallcaps">Vedānta, The Vedas' End</span>.—The
Sanskrit word *Vedānta* *(veda-anta)* signifies "end" or "bound of the
Vedas." It was originally given, at a somewhat advanced stage of their
development, to the works called *Upanishads,* and subsequently to the
various philosophies claiming to be based upon them. Besides the
Upanishads, one of these philosophies will be noticed in the following
pages, namely the system promulgated in the ninth century by Śankara in
his great commentary *(Śārīraka-bhāshya)* upon the epitome of
Upanishadic doctrine commonly known as the *Brahma-sūtra,* or "Aphorisms
of Brahma," and traditionally ascribed to one or the other of the
legendary sages Bādarāyaṇa and Vyāsa.
