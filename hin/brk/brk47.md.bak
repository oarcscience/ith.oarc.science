**BIBLIOGRAPHY**

The beginner will find the following works useful:

<span class="smallcaps">Sacred Books of the East</span>, edited by F.
Max Müller: vol. 1 & 15, Upanishads, translated by F. Max Mūller; vol.
.34, Vedānta-sūtra (i.e. Brahma-sūtra) with the commentary by Śankara,
translated by G. Thibaut. *Oxford, Clarendon Press,* 1879, etc.

<span class="smallcaps">Philosophy of the Upanishads</span>, by A. E.
Gough. *London, Trübner,* 1882.

<span class="smallcaps">The Upanishads</span> (in Sanskrit and English)
and Śankara's commentary (in English), translated by Sītārāma Śāstri and
Gangānātha Jhā. *Madras,* *Seshachari*, 1898, etc.

<span class="smallcaps">Sechzig Upanishads des Veda</span>, übersetzt
von Dr. Paul Deussen. *Leipzig, Brockhaus,* 1897

<span class="smallcaps">The Philosophy of the Upanishads</span>, by Paul
Deussen. Translated by Rev. A. Geden. *Edinburgh, T. & T. Clark,* 1906.

<span class="smallcaps">Das System des Vedanta</span>, von P. Deussen.
*Leipzig, Brockhaus,* 1883.

<span class="smallcaps">The Six Systems of Indian Philosophy</span>, by
F. Max Müller. *London, Longmans,* 1899.

Of the numerous compendia of the later Vedānta we may mention two which
have been published in English—the Vedānta-sāra of Sadānanda, translated
under the title "A Manual of Hindu Pantheism" by Col. G. A. Jacob
(*London, Trübner,* 1881), and the Advaita-makaranda of Lakshmīdhara,

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

with Svayamprakāśa's commentary, translated by A. E. Gough in "The
Pandit," vol. 8, 9 (*Benares,* 1873).

Of the chief *Sanskrit* texts of the Vedānta schools numerous editions
have been published in India. Among the best are those issued in the
"Anandāśrama Sanskrit Series" from the Ānandāśrama Press, Poona.

The student is not likely to derive much exact knowledge from the
publications of irresponsible neo-vedantic societies in Europe and
America. These bodies have the commendable object of making the
principles of the Vedānta intelligible to modern Western thinkers; but
until they display a more scientific and historical spirit their success
is likely to be limited.
