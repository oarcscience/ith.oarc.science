The heart, the mind, consciousness, comprehension, understanding,
intelligence, wisdom, insight, resolution, thought, prudence, eagerness,
memory, conception, power, life, desire, will—all these are names of the
Intelligence. This is Brahma, this is Indra, this is Prajā-pati, this is
all the gods, the five great elements Earth, Wind, Ether, Water, and
Light, the tiny creatures and they that are midway, the seeds of either
kind, the creatures born from eggs, membranes, sweat,

and sprouts, the horses, oxen, men, elephants, whatsoever is breathing,
walking or flying, and whatso is motionless; all this is guided by
intelligence, founded on intelligence. The universe is guided by
intelligence, founded on intelligence. Intelligence is Brahma.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_10"></span>[60:1](brk29.htm#fr_10) See above, §§ 12, 15.
Brahma dwells in the eye during the waking state, in the mind during
dreams, and in the heart during dreamless sleep.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[60:2](brk29.htm#fr_11) *Indra* is a Vedic god
of the first rank; hence by a wordplay our writer identifies him with
Brahma.
