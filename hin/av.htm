<FONT SIZE=2><P>[Editors Note: this, the 42nd volume of the the Sacred Books of the East, is an anthology of representative texts from the Arthrva-veda, the fourth Veda. Since the order is not that of the original I have inserted a five digit number in wavy brackets in front of each hymn, where the first two digits are the book and the remaining three digits are the hymn number. For instance, {07044} is the 44th verse of the 7th book. This is to assist in searching if you know which verse you are looking for. Due to time considerations, I have omitted most of the introduction and the annotations.]</P>
</FONT><H2 ALIGN="CENTER">Excerpt from the Introduction</H2>
<P>The present volume of translations comprises about one third of the entire material of the Atharva-veda in the text of the Saunaka-school. But it represents the contents and spirit of the fourth Veda in a far greater measure than is indicated by this numerical statement. The twentieth book of the Samhit&acirc;, with the exception of the so-called kunt&acirc;pas&ucirc;ktini (hymns 127-136), seems to be a verbatim repetition of mantras contained in the Rig-veda, being employed in the Vait&acirc;na-s&ucirc;ra at the sastras and stotras of the soma-sacrifice: it is altogether foreign to the spirit of the original Atharvan. The nineteenth book is a late addendum, in general very corrupt; its omission (with the exception of hymns 26, 34, 35, 38, 39, 53, and 54) does not detract much from the general impression left by the body of the collection. The seventeenth book consists of a single hymn of inferior interest. Again, books XV and XVI, the former entirely Brahmanical prose, the latter almost entirely so, are of doubtful quality and chronology. Finally, books XIV and XVIII contain respectively the wedding and funeral stanzas of the Atharvan, and are largely coincident with corresponding Mantras of the tenth book of the Rig-veda: they are, granted their intrinsic interest, not specifically Atharvanic. Of the rest of the Atharvan (books I-XIII) there is presented here about one half, naturally that half which seemed to the translator the most interesting and characteristic. Since not a little of the collection rises scarcely above the level of mere verbiage, the process of exclusion has not called for any great degree of abstemiousness.</P>
<P>These successive acts of exclusion have made it possible to present a fairly complete history of each of the hymns translated. The employment of the hymns in the Atharvanic practices is in closer touch with the original purpose of the composition or compilation of the hymns than is true in the case of the other collections of Vedic hymns. Many times, though by no means at all times, the practices connected with a given hymn present the key to the correct interpretation of the hymn itself. In any case it is instructive to see what the Atharvan priests did with the hymns of their own school, even if we must judge their performances to be secondary.</P>
<P>I do not consider any translation of the AV. at this time as final. The most difficult problem, hardly as yet ripe for final solution, is the original function of many mantras, after they have been stripped of certain adaptive modifications, imparted to them to meet the immediate purpose of the Atharvavedin. Not infrequently a stanza has to be rendered in some measure of harmony with its connection, when, in fact, a more original meaning, not at all applicable to its present environment, is but scantily covered up by the 'secondary modifications of the text. This garbled tradition of the ancient texts partakes of the character of popular etymology in the course of the transmission of wofds. New meaning is read into the mantras, and any little stubbornness on their part is met with modifications of their wording. The critic encounters here a very difficult situation: searching investigation of the remaining Vedic collections is necessary before a bridge can be built from the more original meaning to the meaning implied and required by the situation in a given Atharvan hymn. Needless to say the only correct and useful way to translate a mantra in the Atharvan, is to reproduce it with the bent which it has received in the Atharvan. The other Vedic collections are by no means free from the same taint. The entire Vedic tradition, the Rig-veda not excepted, presents rather the conclusion than the beginning of a long period of literary activity. Conventionality of subject-matter, style, form (metre), &amp;c., betray themselves at every step: the 'earliest' books of the RV. are not exempt from the same processes of secondary grouping and adaptation of their mantras, though these are less frequent and less obvious than is the case in the Atharva-veda.</P>
<P>Obligations to previous translators: Weber, Muir, Ludwig, Zimmer, Grill', Henry, &amp;c., are acknowledged in the introduction to each hymn. I regret that the work was in the hands of the printer prior to the appearance of Professor Henry's excellent version of books X-XII. The late lamented Professor Whitney kindly furnished me with the advance sheets of the late Shankar Pandurang Pandit's scholarly edition of the AV. with S&acirc;yana's commentary, as also with many of the readings of the Cashmir text (the so-called Paippal&acirc;da-s&acirc;kh&acirc;) of the AV. Neither the Paippal&acirc;da nor S&acirc;yana sensibly relieves the task of its difficulty and responsibility.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">V, 22. Charm against takman (fever) and related diseases.</H2>
<P>1. May Agni drive the takman away from here, may Soma, the press-stone, and Varuna, of tried skill; may the altar, the straw (upon the altar), and the brightly-flaming fagots (drive him away)! Away to naught shall go the hateful powers!<BR>
2. Thou that makest all men sallow, inflarning them like a searing fire, even now, O takman, thou shalt become void of strength: do thou now go away down, aye, into the depths!<BR>
The takman that is spotted, covered Nvith spots, like reddish sediment, him thou, (O plant) of unremitting potency, drive away down below!<BR>
4. Having made obeisance to the takman, I cast him down below: let him, the champion of Sakambhara, return again to the Mah&acirc;vrishas!<BR>
5. His home is with the M&ucirc;gavants, his home with the Mah&acirc;vrishas. From the moment of thy birth thou art indigenous with the Balhikas.<BR>
6. O takman, vy&atilde;la, v&iacute; gada, vy&aacute;nga, hold off (thy missile) far! Seek the gadabout slave-girl, strike her with thy bolt!<BR>
7. O takman, go to the M&ucirc;gavants, or to the Balhikas farther away! Seek the lecherous S&ucirc;dra female: her, O takman, give a good shaking-up!<BR>
8. Go away to the Mah&acirc;vrishas and the M&ucirc;gavants, thy kinsfolk, and consume them! Those (regions) do we bespeak for the takman, or these regions here other (than ours).<BR>
9. (If) in other regions thou dost not abide, mayest thou that art powerful take pity on us! Takman, now, has become eager: he will go to the Balhikas.<BR>
10. When thou, being cold, and then again deliriously hot, accompanied by cough, didst cause the (sufferer) to shake, then, O takman, thy missiles were terrible: from these surely exempt us!<BR>
11. By no means ally thyself with bal&acirc;sa, cough and spasm! From there do thou not return hither again: that, O takman, do I ask of thee!<BR>
12. O takman, along with thy brother bal&acirc;sa, along with thy sister cough, along with thy cousin p&acirc;man, go to yonder foreign folk!<BR>
13. Destroy the takman that returns on (each) third day, the one that intermits (each) third day, the one that continues without intermission, and the autumnal one; destroy the cold takman, the hot, him that comes in summer, and him that arrives in the rainy season!<BR>
14. To the Gandh&acirc;ris, the M&acirc;gavants, the Angas, and the Magadhas, we deliver over the takman, like a servant, like a treasure!</P>
<P>{06020}</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">VI, 20. Charm against takman (fever).</H2>
<P>1. As if from this Agni (fire), that burns and flashes, (the takman) comes. Let him then, too, as a babbling drunkard, pass away! Let him, the impious one, search out some other person, not ourselves! Reverence be to the takman with the burning weapon!<BR>
2. Reverence be to Rudra, reverence to the takman, reverence to the luminous king Varuna! Reverence to heaven, reverence to earth, reverence to the plants!<BR>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">I, 25. Charm against takman (fever).</H2>
<P>1. When Agni, having entered the waters, burned, where the (gods) who uphold the order (of the universe) rendered homage (to Agni), there, they say, is thy origin on high: do thou feel for us, and spare us, O takman!<BR>
2. Whether thou art flame, whether thou art heat, or whether from licking chips (of wood) thou bast arisen, Hr&ucirc;du by name art thou, O god of the yellow: do thou feel for us, and spare us, O takman!<BR>
3. Whether thou art burning, whether thou art scorching, or whether thou art the son of king Varuna, Hr&ucirc;du by name art thou, O god of the yellow: do thou feel for us, and spare us, O takman!<BR>
4. To the cold takman, and to the deliriously hot, the glowing, do I render homage. To hirn that returns on the morrow, to him that returns for two (successive) days, to the takman that returns on the third day, homage shall be!</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">V, 4. Prayer to the kushtha-plant to destroy takman (fever).</H2>

7. He swallows her (the cow), bristling with a hundred hooks, (but) is unable to digest her, he, the fool who, devouring the food of the Brahmans, thinks, 'I am eating a luscious (morsel).'<BR>
8. (The Brahman's) tongue turns into a bow. string, his voice into the neck of an arrow; his windpipe, his teeth are bedaubed with holy fire: with these the Brahman strikes those who revile the gods, by means of bows that have the strength to reach the heart, discharged by the gods.<BR>
9. The Br&acirc;hmanas have sharp arrows, are armed with missiles, the arrow whi ch they hurl goes not in vain; pursuing him with their holy fire and their wrath, even from afar, do they pierce him.<BR>
10. They who ruled over a thousand, and were themselves ten hundred, the Vaitahavya, when they devoured the cow of the Br&acirc;hmana, perished.<BR>
11. The cow herself, when slaughtered, came down upon the Vaitahavyas. who had roasted for themselves the last she-goat of Kesarapr&acirc;bandh&acirc;.<BR>
12. The one hundred and one persons whom the earth did cast off, because they had injured the offspring of a Br&acirc;hmana, were ruined irretrievably.<BR>
13. As a reviler of the gods does he live among mortals, having swallowed poison, he becomes more bone (than flesh). He that injureth a Br&acirc;hmana, whose kin are the gods, does not reach heaven by the road of the Fathers.<BR>
14. Agni is called our guide, Soma our heir, Indra slays those who curse (us): that the strong (sages) know.<BR>
15. Like a poisoned arrow, O king, like -an adder, O lord of cattle, is the terrible arrow of the Br&acirc;hmana: with that he smites those who revile (the gods).</P>
<P>{05019}</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">V, 19. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.</H2>
<P>1. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of touching the heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the Sri&ntilde;gaya Vaitahavyas.<BR>
2. The persons who pierced Brihats&acirc;man, the descendant of Angiras, the Br&acirc;hmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their offspring.<BR>
3. They who spat upon the Br&acirc;hmana, who desired tribute from him, they sit in the middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.<BR>
4. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches does she destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born (there).<BR>
5. A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter, her meat, when eaten, is sapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a crime against the Fathers.<BR>
6. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy the Br&acirc;hmana, then royal power is dissipated, where the Br&acirc;hmana is oppressed.<BR>
7. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed, two-mouthed, two-tongued, she dispels the rule of the oppressor of the Brahman.<BR>
8. That (kingdom) surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship; misfortune strikes that kingdom, in which they injure a Br&acirc;hmana.<BR>
9. The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within our shade,' him who covets the wealth that belongs to a Br&acirc;hmana, O N&acirc;rada!<BR>
10. King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison, prepared by the gods: no one who has devoured the cow of a Br&acirc;hmana retains the charge of a kingdom.<BR>
11. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, because they had injured the offspring of a Br&acirc;hmana, were ruined irretrievably.<BR>
12. The k&ucirc;d&icirc;-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the track (of death), which they fasten to the dead, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did declare (to be) thy couch.<BR>
13. The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the oppressed (Brahman), as he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<BR>
14. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they moisten his beard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<BR>
15. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the oppressor of Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him, he does not guide his friend according to his will.</P>
<P>{05007}</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">V, 7. Prayer to appease Ar&acirc;ti, the demon of grudge and avarice.</H2>
<P>1. Bring (wealth) to us, do not stand in our way, O Ar&acirc;ti; do not keep from us the sacrificial reward as it is being taken (to us)! Adoration be to the power of grudge, the power of failure, adoration to Ar&acirc;ti!<BR>
2. To thy advising minister, whom thou, Ar&acirc;ti, didst make thy agent, do we make obeisance. Do not bring failure to my wish!<BR>
3. May our wish, instilled by the gods, be fulfilled by day and night! We go in quest of Ar&acirc;ti. Adoration be to Ar&acirc;ti!<BR>
4. Sarasvat&icirc; (speech), Anumati (favour), and Bhaga (fortune) we go to invoke. Pleasant, honied, words I have spoken on the occasions when the gods were invoked.<BR>
5. Him whom I implore with V&acirc;k Sarasvat&icirc; (the goddess-of speech), the yoke-fellow of thought, faith shall find to-day, bestowed by the brown soma!<BR>
6. Neither our wish nor our speech do thou frustrate! May Indra and Agni both bring us wealth! Do ye all who to-day desire to make gifts to us gain favour with Ar&acirc;ti!<BR>
7. Go far away, failure! Thy missile do we avert. I know thee (to be) oppressive and piercing, O Ar&acirc;ti!<BR>
8. Thou dost even transform thyself into a naked woman, and attach thyself to people in their sleep, frustrating, O Ar&acirc;ti, the thought, and intention of man.<BR>
9. To her who, great, and of great dimension, did penetrate all the regions, to this golden-locked Nirriti (goddess of misfortune), I have rendered obeisance.<BR>
10. To the gold-complexioned, lovely one, who rests upon golden cushions, to the great one, to that Ar&acirc;ti who wears golden robes, I have rendered obeisance.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">XII, 4. The necessity of giving away sterile cows to the Brahmans.</H2>
<P>1. 'I give,' he shall surely say,'the sterile cow to the begging Brahmans'--and they have noted her--that brings progeny and offspring!<BR>
2. With his offspring does he trade, of his cattle is he deprived, that refuses to give the cow of the gods to the begging descendants of the Rishis.<BR>
3. Through (the gift of) a cow with broken horns his (cattle) breaks down, through a lame one he tumbles into a pit, through a mutilated one his house is burned, through a one-eyed one his property is given away.<BR>
4. Flow of blood attacks the cattle-owner from the spot where her dung is deposited: this understanding there is about the vas&acirc; (the sterile cow); for thou (sterile cow) art said to be very difficult to deceive!<BR>
5. From the resting-place of her feet the (disease) called viklindu overtakes (the owner, or the cattle). Without sickness breaks down (the cattle) which she sniffs upon with her nose.<BR>
6. He that pierces her ears is estranged from the gods. He thinks: 'I am making a mark (upon her),' (but) he diminishes his own property.<BR>
7. If any one for whatsoever purpose cuts her tail then do his colts die, and the wolf tears his calves.<BR>
8. If a crow has injured her hair, as long as she is with her owner then do his children die: decline overtakes them without (noticeable) sickness.<BR>
9. If the serving-maid sweeps together her dung, that bites as lye, there arises from this sin disfigurement that passeth not away.<BR>
10. The sterile cow in her very birth is born for the gods and Br&acirc;hmanas. Hence to the Brahmans she is to be given: that, they say, guarantees the security of one's own property.<BR>
11. For those that come requesting her the cow has been created by the gods. Oppression of Brahmans it is called, if he keeps her for himself.<BR>
12. He that refuses to give the cow of the gods to the descendants of the Rishis who ask for it, infringes upon the gods, and the wrath of the Br&acirc;hmanas.<BR>
13. Though he derives benefit from this sterile cow, another (cow) then shall he seek! When kept she injures (his) folk, if he refuses to give her after she has been asked for!<BR>
14. The sterile cow is as a treasure deposited for die Br&acirc;hmanas: they come here for her, with whomsoever she is born.<BR>
15. The Br&acirc;hmanas come here for their own, when they come for the sterile cow. The refusal of her is, as though he were oppressing them in other concerns.<BR>
I&amp; If she herds up to her third year, and no disease is discovered in her, and he finds her to be a sterile cow, O N&acirc;rada, then must he look for the Br&acirc;hmanas.<BR>
17. If he denies that she is sterile, a treasure deposited for the gods, then Bhava and Sarva, both, come upon him, and hurl their arrow upon him.<BR>
18. Though he does not perceive upon her either udder, or tits, yet both yield him milk, if he has prevailed upon himself to give away the sterile cow.<BR>
19. Hard to cheat, she oppresses him, if, when asked for, he refuses to give her. His desires are not fulfilled, if he aims to accomplish them without giving her away.<BR>
20. The gods did ask for the sterile cow, making the Br&acirc;hmana their mouthpiece. The man that does not give (her) enters into the wrath of all of these.<BR>
21. Into the wrath of the cattle enters he that gives not the sterile cow to the Br&acirc;hmanas; if he, the mortal, appropriates the share deposited for the gods.<BR>
22. Even if a hundred other Br&acirc;hmanas beg the owner for the sterile cow, yet the gods did say anent her: 'The cow belongs to him that knoweth thus.'<BR>
23. He that refuses the sterile cow to him that knoweth thus, and gives her to others, difficult to dwell upon is for him the earth with her divinities.<BR>
24. The gods did beg the sterile cow of him wilh whom she was born at first. That very one N&acirc;rada recognised and drove forth in company with the gods.<BR>
25. The sterile cow renders childless, and poor in cattle, him that yet appropriates her, when she has been begged for by the Br&acirc;hmanas.<BR>
26. For Agni and Soma, for K&acirc;ma, for Mitra, and for Varuna, for these do the Br&acirc;hmanas beg her: upon these he infringes, if he gl ves her not.<BR>
27. As long as the owner does not himself hear the stanzas referring to (the giving away of) her, she may herd among his cattle; (only) if he has not heard (them) may she pass the night in his house.<BR>
28. He that has listened to the stanzas, yet has permitted her to herd among the cattle, his life and prosperity the angry gods destroy.<BR>
29. The sterile cow, even when she rambles freely, is a treasure deposited for the gods. Make evident thy true nature when thou desirest to go to thy (proper) stable!<BR>
30. She makes evident her nature when she desires to go to her (proper) stable. Then indeed the sterile cow puts it into the minds of the Brahmans to beg (for her).<BR>
31. She evolves it in her mind, that (thought) reaches the gods. Then do the Brahmans come to beg for the sterile cow.<BR>
32. The call svadh&acirc; befriends him with the Fathers, the sacrifice with the gods. Through the gift of the sterile cow the man of royal caste incurs not the anger of (her), his mother.<BR>
33. The sterile cow is the mother of the man of royal caste: thus was it from the beginning. It is said to be no (real) deprivation if she is given to the Brahmans.<BR>
34. As if he were to rob the ghee ladled up for Agni (the fire) from the (very) spoon, thus, if he gives not the sterile cow to the Brahmans, does he infringe upon Agni.<BR>
35. The sterile cow has the purodasa (sacrificial cake) for her calf, she yields plentiful milk, helps in this world, and fulfils all wishes for him that gives her (to the Brahmans).<BR>
36. The sterile cow fulfils all wishes in the kingdom of Yama for him that gives her. But they say that hell falls to the lot of him that withholds her, when she has been begged for.<BR>
37. The sterile cow, even if she should become fruitful, lives in anger at her owner: 'since he did regard me as sterile (without giving me to the Brahmans), he shall be bound in the fetters of death!'<BR>
38, He who thinks that the cow is sterile, and (yet) roasts her at home, even his children qnd grandchildren Brihaspati causes to be importuned (for her).<BR>
39. Fiercely does the (supposed) sterile cow burn when she herds with the cattle, though she be a (fruitful) cow. She verily, too, milks poison for the owner that does not present her.<BR>
40. It pleases the cattle when she is given to the Brahmans; moreover, the sterile cow is pleased, when she is made an offering to the gods (Brahmans).<BR>
41. From the sterile cows which the gods, returning from the sacrifice, created, N&acirc;rada picked out as (most) terrible the vilipt&icirc;.<BR>
42. In reference to her the gods reflected: 'Is she a sterile cow, or not?' And N&acirc;rada in reference to her said: 'Of sterile cows she is the most sterile!'<BR>
43. 'How many sterile cows (are there), O N&acirc;rada, which thou knowest to be born among men?' About these do I ask thee, that knowest: 'Of which may the non-Br&acirc;hmana not eat?'<BR>
44. Of the vilipt&icirc;, of her that has born a sterile cow, and of the sterile cow (herself), the non-Br&acirc;hmana, that hopes for prosperity, shall not eat!<BR>
45. Reverence be to thee, O N&acirc;rada, that knowest thoroughly which sterile cow is the most terrible, by withholding which (from the Brahmans) destruction is.incurred.<BR>
46. The vilipt&icirc;, O Brihaspati, her that has, begotten a sterile cow, and the sterile cow (herself), the non-Br&acirc;hmana, that hopes for prosperity, shall not eat!<BR>
47. Three kinds, forsooth, of sterile cows are there: the vilipt&icirc;, she that has begotten a sterile cow, and the sterile cow (herself). These he shall give to the Brahmans; (then) does he not estrange himself from Prag&acirc;pati.<BR>
48. 'This is your oblation, O Br&acirc;hmanas,' thus shall he reflect, if he is supplicated, if they ask him for the sterile cow, terrible in the house of him that refuses to give her.<BR>
49. The gods animadverted in reference to Bheda and the sterile cow, angry because he had not given her, in these verses-and therefore he (Bheda) perished.<BR>
50. Bheda did not present the sterile cow, though requested by Indra: for this sin the gods crushed him in battle.<BR>
51. The counsellors that advise the withholding (of the sterile cow), they, the rogues, in their folly, conflict with the wrath of Indra.<BR>
52. They who lead the owner of cattle aside, then say to him: 'do not give,' in their folly they run into the missile hurled by Rudra.<BR>
53. And if he roasts the sterile cow at home, whether he makes a sacrifice of her, or not, he sins against the gods and Br&acirc;hmanas, and as a cheat falls from heaven.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">XI, 1. The preparation of the brahmaudana, the porridge given as a fee to the Brahmans.</H2>
<P>1. O Agni, come into being! Aditi here in her throes, longing for sons, is cooking the porridge for the Brahmans, The seven Rishis, that did create the beings, shall here churn thee, along with progeny!<BR>
2. Produce the smoke, ye lusty friends; unharmed by wiles go ye into the contest! Here is the Agni (fire) who gains battles, and commands powerful warriors, with whom the gods did conquer the demons.<BR>
3. O Agni, to a great heroic deed thou wast aroused, to cook the Brahman's porridge, O G&acirc;tavedas! The seven Rishis, that did create the beings, have produced thee. Grant her (the wife) wealth together with undiminished heroes!<BR>
4. Burn, O Agni, after having been kindled by the firewood, bring skilfully hither the gods that are to be revered! Causing the oblation to cook for these (Brahmans), do thou raise this (sacrificer) to the highest firmament!<BR>
5. The, threefold share which was of yore assigned to you (belongs) to the gods, the (departed) Fathers, and to the mortals (the priests). Know your shares! I divide them for you: the (share) of the gods shall protect this (woman)!<BR>
6. O Agni, possessed of might, superior, thou dost without fail prevail! Bend down to the ground our hateful rivals!--This measure, that is being measured, and has been measured, may constitute thy kin into (people) that render thee tribute!<BR>
7. Mayest thou together with thy kin be endowed with sap! Elevate her (the wife) to great heroism! Ascend on high to the base of the firmament, which they call 'the world of brightness'!<BR>
8. This great goddess earth, kindly disposed, shall receive the (sacrificial) skin! Then may we go to the world of well-doing (heaven)!<BR>
9. Lay these two press-stones, well coupled, upon the skin; crush skilfully the (soma-) shoots for the sacrificer! Crush down, (O earth), and beat down, those who are hostile to her (the wife); lift up high, and elevate her offspring!<BR>
10. Take into thy hands, O man, the press-stones that work together: the gods that are to be revered have come to thy sacrifice! Whatever three wishes thou dost choose, I shall here procure for thee unto fulfilment.<BR>
11. This, (O winnowing-basket), is thy purpose, and this thy nature: may Aditi, mother of heroes, take hold of thee! Winnow out those who are hostile to this (woman); afford her wealth and undiminished heroes!<BR>
12. Do ye, (O grains), remain in the (winnowing-) basket, while (the wind) blows over you; be separated, ye who are fit for the sacrifice, from the chaff! May we in happiness be superior to all our equals! I bend down under our feet those that hate us.<BR>
13. Retire, O woman, and return promptly! The stable of the waters (water-vessel) has settled upon thee, that thou mayest carry it: of these (the waters) thou shalt take such as are fit for sacrifice; having intelligently divided them off, thou shalt leave the rest behind!<BR>
14. These bright women, (the waters), have come hither. Arise, thou woman, and gather strength! To thee, that art rendered by thy husband a true wife, (and) by thy children rich in offspring, the sacrifice has come: receive the (water-) vessel!<BR>
15. The share of food that belongs to you of yore has been set aside for you. Instructed by the Rishis bring thou (woman) hither this water! May this sacrifice win advancement for you, win prAection, win offspring for you; may it be mighty, win cattle, and heroes for you!<BR>
16. O Agni, the sacrificial pot has settled upon thee: do thou shining, brightly glowing, heat it with thy glow! May the divine descendants of the Rishis, assembled about their share (of the porridge), full of fervour, heat this (pot) at the proper time!<BR>
17. Pure and clear may these sacrificial women, the waters bright, flow into the pot! The), have given us abundant offspring and cattle. May he that cooks the porridge go to the world of the pious (heaven)!<BR>
18. Purified by (our) prayer, and clarified by the ghee are the soma-shoots, (and) these sacrificial grains. Enter the water; may the pot receive you! When ye have cookect this (porridge) go ye to the world of the pious (heaven)!<BR>
19. Spread out far unto great extent, with a thousand surfaces, in the world of the pious! Grandfathers, fathers, children, grandchildren--I am the fifteenth one that did cook thee.<BR>
20. The porridge has a thousand surfaces, a hundred streams, and is indestructible; it is the road of the gods, leads to heaven. Yonder (enemies) do I place upon thee: injure them and their offspring; (but) to me that brings gifts thou shalt be merciful!<BR>
21. Step upon the altar (vedi); make this woman thrive in her progeny; repel the demons.; advance her! May we in happiness be superior to all our equals! I bend down under our feet all those that hate us.<BR>
22. Turn towards her with cattle, (thou pot), face towards her, together with the divine powers! Neither curses nor hostile magic shall reach thee; rule in thy dwelling free from disease!<BR>
23. Properly built, placed with care, this altar (vedi) has been arranged of yore for the Brahmans porridge. Put it, O woman, upon the purified amsadhrl; place there the porridge for the divine (Br&acirc;hmanas)!<BR>
24. May this sacrificial ladle (sruk), the second hand of Aditi, which the seven Rishis, the creators of the beings, did fashion, may this spoon, knowing the limbs of the porridge, heap it upon the altar!<BR>
25. The divine (Br&acirc;hmanas) shall sit down to thee, the cooked saerfice: do thou again descending from the fire, approach them! Clarified by soma settle in the belly of the Br&acirc;hmanas; the descendants of the Rishis who eat thee shall not take harm!<BR>
26. O king Soma, infuse harmony into the good Br&acirc;hmanas who shall sit about thee! Eagerly do I invite to the porridge the Rishis, descended from Rishis, that are born of religious fervour, and gladly obey the call.<BR>
27. These pure and clear sacrificial women (the waters) I put into the hands of the Br&acirc;hmanas severally. With whatever wish I pour this upon you, may Indra. accompanied by the Maruts grant this to me!<BR>
28. This gold is my immortal light, this ripe fruit of the field is my wish-granting cow. This treasure I present to the Br&acirc;hmanas: I prepare for myself a road that leads. to the Fathers in the heavens.<BR>
29. Scatter the spelt into Agni G&acirc;tavedas (the fire), sweep away to a far distance the chaff! This (chaff) we have heard, is the share of the ruler of the house (Agni), and we know, too, what belonos to Nirriti (destruction) as her share.<BR>
30. Note, (O porridge), him that takes pains, and cooks and presses the soma; lift him up to the heavenly road, upon which, after he has reached the fullest age, he shall ascend to the highest firmament, the supreme heavens!<BR>
31. Anoint (with ghee), O adhvaryu (priest), the surface of this sustaining (porridge), make skilfully a place for the melted butter; with ghee do thou anoint all its limbs! I prepare for myself a road that leads to the Fathers in the heavens.<BR>
32. O sustaining (porridge), cast destruction and strife among such as are sitting about thee, and are not Br&acirc;hmanas! (But) the descendants of the -Rishis, that eat thee, being full of substance, spreading forth, shall not take harm!<BR>
33. To the descendants of the Rishis I make thee over, O porridge; those who are not descended from Rishis have no share in it! May Agni as my guardian, may all the Maruts, and all the gods watch over the cooked food!<BR>
34. Thee (the porridge) that milkest the sacrifice, art evermore abundant, the male milch-cow, the seat of wealth, we beseech for immortality of off-spring and long life with abundance of wealth.<BR>
35. Thou art a lusty male, penetratest heaven: go thou to the Rishis, descended from Rishis! Dwell in the world of the pious: there is a well-prepared (place) for us two!<BR>
36. Pack thyself up, go forth! O Agni, prepare the roads, that lead to the gods! By these: well-prepared (roads) may we reach the sacrifice, standing upon the firmament (that shines) with seven rays!<BR>
37. With the light with which the gods, having cooked the porridge for the Br&acirc;manas, ascended to heaven, to the world of the pious, with that would we go to the world of the pious, ascending to the light, to the highest firmament!</P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">XII, 3. The preparation of the brahmaudana, the porridge given as a fee to the Brahmans.</H2>
<P>1. (Thyself) a male, step thou upon the hide of the male (steer): go, call thither all that is dear to thee! At whatever age ye two formerly did first unite (in marriage), may that age be your common lot in Yama's kingdom!<BR>
2. Your sight shall be as clear (as formerly), your strength as abundant, your lustre as great, your vitality as manifold! When Agni, the (funeral-) pyre, fastens himself upon the corpse, then as a pair ye.shall rise from the (cooked) porridge!<BR>
3. Come ye together in this world, upon the road to the gods, and in Yama's realms! By purifications purified call ye together the offspring that has sprung from you!<BR>
4. Around the water united, sit ye down, O children; around this living (father) and the waters that refresh the living! Partake of these (waters), and of that porridge which the mother of you two cooks, and which is called amrita (ambrosia)!<BR>
5. The porridge which the father of you two, and which the mother cooks, unto freedom from defilement and foulness of speech, that porridge with a hundred streams (of ghee), leading to heaven, has penetrated with might both the hemispheres of the world.<BR>
6. In that one of the two hemispheres and the two heavenly worlds, conquered by the pious, which especially abounds in light, and is rich in honey, in that do ye in the fulness of time come together with your children!<BR>
7. Keep ever on in an easterly direction: this is the region that the faithful cling to! When your cooked porridge has been prepared on the fire, hold together, O man and wife, that ye may guard it!<BR>
8. When ye shall have reached the southerly direction, turn ye to this vessel! In that Yama, associated with the fathers, shall give abundant protection to your cooked porridge!<BR>
9. This westerly direction is especially favoured: in it Soma is ruler and consoler. To this hold, attach yourselves to the pious: then as a pair ye shall rise from the cooked porridge!<BR>
10. The northerly direction shall make our realm the very uppermost, in offspring, uppermost! The purusha is the metre pahkti: with all (our kin), endowed with all their limbs, may we be united!<BR>
11. This 'firm' direction (nadir) is Vir&acirc;g (brilliancy): reverence be to her; may she be kind to my children and to me! Mayest thou, O goddess Aditi, who boldest all treasures, as an alert guardian guard the cooked porridge!<BR>
12. As a father his children do thou, (O earth), embrace us; may gentle winds blow upon us here on earth! Then the porridge which the two divinities (the sacrificer and his wife) are here preparing for us shall take note of our religious fer~our and our truth!<BR>
13. Whatever the black bird, that has come hither stealthily, has touched of that ahich has stuck to the rim, or whatever the wet-banded slavegirl does pollute-may ye, O waters, purify (that) mortar and pestle!<BR>
14. May this sturdy press-stone, with broad bottom, purified by the purifiers, beat away the Rakshas! Settle upon the skin, afford firm protection; may man and wife not come to grief in their children!<BR>
15. The (pestle of) wood has come to us together with the gods: it drives away the Rakshas and Pis&acirc;kas. Up it shall rise, shall let its voice resound<BR>
through it let us conquer all the worlds!<BR>
16. The cattle clothed itself in sevenfold strength, those among them that are sleek and those that are poor. The thirty-three gods attend them mayest thou, (O cattle), guide us to the heavenly world!<BR>
17. To the bright world of heaven thou shalt lead us; (there) let us be united with wife and children! I take her hand, may she follow me there; neither Nirriti (destruction), nor Ar&acirc;ti (grudge), shall gain mastery over us!<BR>
18. May we get past the evil Gr&acirc;hi (seizure)! Casting aside darkness do thou, (O pestle), let thy lovely voice resound; do not, O wooden tool, when raised, do injury; do not mutilate the grain devoted to the gods!<BR>
19. All-embracing, about to be covered with ghee, enter, (O pot), as a co-dweller this space!--Take hold of the winnowing-basket, that has been grown by the rain: the spelt and the chaff it shall sift out!<BR>
20. Three regions are constructed after the pattern of the Br&acirc;hmana: yonder heaven, the earth, and the atmosphere.--Take the (soma-) shoots, and hold one another, (O man and wife)! They (the shoots) shall swell (with moisture), and again go back into the winnowing-basket!<BR>
21. Of manifold variegated colours are the animals, one colour hast thou, (O porridge), when successfully prepared.--Push these (soma-) Shoots upon this red skin; the press-stone shall purify them as the washer-man his clothes!<BR>
22. Thee, the (pot of) earth, I place upon the earth: your substance is the same, though thine, (O pot), is modified. Even though a blow has cracked or scratched thee, do not therefore burst: with this verse do I cover that up!<BR>
23. Gently as a mother embrace the son: I unite thee, (pot of) earth, with the earth! Mayest thou, the hollow pot, not totter upon the altar, when thou art pressed by the tools of sacrifice and the ghee!<BR>
24. May Agni who cooks thee protect thee on the east, Indra with the Maruts protect thee on the south! May Varuna on the west support thee upon thy foundation, may Soma on the north hold thee together!<BR>
25. Purified by the purifiers, the (waters) flow pure from the clouds, they reach to the spaces of heaven, and of the earth. They are alive, refresh the livino, and are firmly rooted: may Agni heat them, after they have been poured into the vessel!<BR>
26. From heaven they come, into the earth they penetrate; from the earth they penetrate into the atmosphere. May they, now pure, yet purify themselves further; may they conduct us to the heavenly world!<BR>

41. The goodly streams, swelling with honey, mixed with ghee, the seats of ambrosia, all these does he obtain, ascends to heaven. In sixty autumns the treasurer (of the porridge) shall fetch it!<BR>
42. The treasurer shall fetch this treasure: all outsiders round about shall not control it! The heaven-directed porridge, that has been presented and deposited by us, in three divisions has reached the thrte heavens.<BR>
43. May Agni burn the ungodly Rakshas; the flesh-devouring Pis&acirc;ka shall have nothing here to partake of! We drive him away, hold him afar from us: the &Acirc;dityas and Angiras shall stay near it!<BR>
44. To the &Acirc;dityas and the Angiras do I offer this (food of) honey, mixed with ghee. Do ye two, (man and wife), with clean hands, without having injured a Br&acirc;hmana, performing pious deeds, go to that heavenly world!<BR>
45. I would obtain this highest part of it (the porridge), the place from which the highest lord permeates (the all). Pour butter upon it, anoint it witb plentiful ghee: this here is our share, fit for the Angiras!<BR>
46. For the sake of truth and holy strength do we make over this porridge as a hoarded treasure to the gods: it shall not be lost to us in gaming or in the assembly; do not let it go to any other person before me!<BR>
47. I cook, and I give (to the Brahmans), and so, too, my wife, at my religious rite and practice.--With the birth of a son the world of children has arisen (for you): do ye two hold on to a life that extends beyond (your years)!<BR>

51. This (naked skin) among the hides is born upon man (alone), all other animals are riot naked. Clothe yourselves, (ye Brahmans), in sheltering garments: (even) the face of the porridge is a homespun garment!<BR>
52. What falsehood thou shalt speak at play and in the assembly, or the falsehood that thou shalt speak through lust for gain--put on together, (O man and wife), this same garment, deposit upon it every blemish!<BR>
53. Produce rain, go to the gods, let smoke arise from (thy) surface; all-embracing, about to be covered with ghee, enter as a co-dweller this place!<BR>
54. In many ways heaven assumes within itself a different form, according to circumstances. It (the heaven) has laid aside its black form, purifying itself to a bright (form); the red form do I sacrifice fot thee into the fire.<BR>
55. Thee here we hand over to the eastern direction, to Agni as sovereign lord, to the black serpent as guardian, to &Acirc;ditya as bowman: do ye guard it for us, until we arrive!

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">IX, 1. Hymn to the honey-lash of the Asvins.</H2>
<P>1. From heaven, from earth, from the atmosphere, from the sea, from the fire, and from the wind, the honey-lash hath verily sprung. This, clothed in amrita (ambrosia), all the creatures revering, acclaim in their hearts.<BR>
2. Great sap of all forms (colours) it hath-they call thee moreover the seed of the ocean. Where the honey-lash comes bestowing gifts, there life's breath, and there immortality has settled down.<BR>
3. Men severally, contemplating it profoundly, behold its action upon the earth: from the fire and from the wind the honey-lash hath verily sprung, the strong child of the Maruts.<BR>
4. Mother of the &Acirc;dityas, daughter of the Vasus, breath of life of created beings, nave of immortality, the honey-lash, golden-coloured, dripping ghee, as a great embryo, moves among mortals.<BR>
5. The god's begot the lash of honey, from it came an embryo having all forms (colours). This, as soon as born, (while yet) young its mother nourishes; this, as soon as born, surveys all the worlds.<BR>
6. Who knows it and who perceives it, the inexhaustible, soma-holding cup that has come from the heart of it (the honey-lash)? 'Tis the wise priest: he shall derive inspiration from it!<BR>
7. He knows them, and he perceives them, the inexhaustible breasts of it (the honey-lash), that yield a thousand streams. Nourishment they pour out -without recalcitration.<BR>
8. The great (cow) that loudly gives forth the sound 'him,' that bestows strength, and goes with loud shouts to the holy act, bellowing with lust for the three (male) gharmas (fires), she lows, and drips with (streams) of milk.<BR>
9. When the waters, the mighty bulls, self-sovereign, wait upon (the cow), swollen with milk, (then) they, the waters, pour nourishment (upon her), and cause her to pour nourishment at will for him that knoweth this.<BR>
10. The thunder is thy voice, O Prag&acirc;pati; as a bull thou hurlest thy fire upon the earth. From the fire, and from the wind the honey-lash hath verily sprung, the strong child of the Maruts.<BR>
11. As the soma at the morn ing-pressure is dear to the Asvins, thus in my own person, O Asvins, lustre shall be sustained!<BR>
12. As the soma at the second (mid-day) pressure is dear to Indra and Agni, thus in my own person, O Indra, and Agni, lustre shall be sustained!<BR>
13. As the soma at the third pressure (evening) is dear to the Ribhus, thus in my own person, O Ribhus, lustre shall be sustained!<BR>
14. May I beget honey for myself; may I obtain honey for myself! Bringing milk, O Agni, I have come:. endow me with lustre!<BR>
15. Endow me, O Agni, with lustre, endow me with offspring and with life! May the gods take note of this (prayer) of mine; may Indra together with the Rishis (take note of it)!<BR>
16. As bees carry together honey upon honey, thus in my own person, O Asvins, lustre shall be sustained!<BR>
17. As the bees pile this honey upon honey, thus in my own person, O Asvins, lustre, brilliance, strength, and force shall be sustained!<BR>
18. The honey that is in the mountains, in the heights; in the cows, and in the horses; the honey which is in the sur&acirc; (brandy) as it is being poured out, that shall be in me!<BR>
19. O Asvins, lords of brightness, anoint me with the honey of the bee, that I may speak forceful speech among men!<BR>
20. The thunder is thy speech, O Prag&acirc;pati; as a bull thou hurlest thy fire upon earth and heaven. All animals live upon it (the earth), and she with it (Prag&acirc;pati's fire) fills nourishment and food.<BR>
21. The earth is the staff, the atmosphere the embryo, the heaven the whip (itself?), the lightning the whip-cord; of gold is the tip (of the whip?).<BR>
22. He that knoweth the seven honies of the whip becomes rich in honey; (to wit), the Br&acirc;hmana, the king, the cow, the ox, rice, barley, and honey as the seventh.<BR>
23. Rich in honey becomes he, rich in honey become his appurtenances, worlds rich in honey does he win, he that knoweth thus.<BR>
24. When in a bright sky it thunders, then Prag&acirc;pati manifests himself to (his) creatures (prag&acirc;h). Therefore do I stand with the sacred cord suspended from the right shoulder (pr&acirc;kinopavita), saying, 'O Prag&acirc;pati, watch over me!' The creatures (prag&acirc;h) watch over him, Prag&acirc;pati watches over him, that knoweth thus.</P></BODY>
