# SECTION III

Yudhishthira said, "Tender, possessed of a graceful presence, and
deserving of every luxury as thou art, what office wilt thou, O heroic
Nakula, discharge while living in the dominions of that king? Tell me
all about it!"

Nakula said, "Under the name of Granthika, I shall become the keeper of
the horses of king Virata. I have a thorough knowledge (of this work)
and am skilful in tending horses. Besides, the task is agreeable to me,
and I possess great skill in training and treating horses; and horses
are ever dear to me as they are to thee, O king of the Kurus. At my
hands even colts and mares become docile; these never become vicious in
bearing a rider or drawing a car. <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) And
those persons in the city of Virata that may enquire of me, I shall, O
bull of the Bharata race, say,--*Formerly I was employed by Yudhishthira
in the charge of his horses.* Thus disguised, O king, I shall spend my
days delightfully in the city of Virata. No one will be able to discover
me as I will gratify the monarch thus! <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md)

Yudhishthira said, "How wilt thou, O Sahadeva, bear thyself before that
king? And what, O child, is that which thou wilt do in order to live in
disguise."

Sahadeva replied, "I will become a keeper of the [kine](errata.htm#0.md) of
Virata's king. I am skilled in milking kine and taking their history as
well as in taming their fierceness. Passing under the name of Tantripal,
I shall perform my duties deftly. Let thy heart's fever be dispelled.
Formerly I was frequently employed to look after thy kine, and, O Lord
of earth, I have a particular knowledge of that work. And, O monarch, I
am well-acquainted

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

with the nature of kine, as also with their auspicious marks and other
matters relating to them. I can also discriminate bulls with auspicious
marks, the scent of whose urine may make even the barren being forth
child. Even thus will I live, and I always take delight in work of this
kind. Indeed, no one will then be able to recognise me, and I will
moreover gratify the monarch,"

Yudhishthira said, "This is our beloved wife dearer to us than our
lives. Verily, she deserveth to be cherished by us like a mother, and
regarded like an elder sister. Unacquainted as she is with any kind of
womanly work, what office will Krishna, the daughter of Drupada,
perform? Delicate and young, she is a princess of great repute. Devoted
to her lords, and eminently virtuous, also, how will she live? Since her
birth, she hath enjoyed only garlands and perfume? and ornaments and
costly robes."

Draupadi replied, "There is a class of persons called
*Sairindhris,* <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) who enter the services
of other. Other females, however (that are respectable) do not do so. Of
this class there are some. I shall give myself out as a *Sairindhri*,
skilled in dressing hair. And, O Bharata, on being questioned by the
king, I shall say that I served as a waiting woman of Draupadi in
Yudhishthira's household. I shall thus pass my days in disguise. And I
shall serve the famous Sudeshna, the wife of the king. Surely, obtaining
me she will cherish me (duly). Do not grieve so, O king."

"Yudhishthira said, "O Krishna, thou speakest well. But O fair girl,
thou wert born in a respectable family. Chaste as thou art, and always
engaged in observing virtuous vows, thou knowest not what is sin. Do
thou, therefore, conduct thyself in such a way that sinful men of evil
hearts may not be gladdened by gazing at thee."
