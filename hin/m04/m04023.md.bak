# SECTION XXII

"Vaisampayana said, 'Then all the relatives of Kichaka, arriving at that
place, beheld him there and began to wail aloud, surrounding him on all
sides. And beholding Kichaka with every limb mangled, and lying like a
tortoise dragged to dry ground from the water, all of them were overcome
with exceeding fright, and the bristles of their bodies stood on end.
And seeing him crushed all over by Bhima, like a Danava by Indra, they
proceeded to take him outside, for performing his funeral obsequies. And
then those persons of the *Suta* clan thus assembled together espied
Krishna of faultless limbs hard by, who stood reclining on a pillar. And
all the Kichakas assembled there, exclaimed, 'Let this unchaste woman be
slain for whom Kichaka hath himself lost his life. Or, without slaying
her here, let us cremate her with him that had lusted after her,--for it
behoveth us to accomplish in every way what is agreeable to that
deceased son of *Suta*.' And then they addressed Virata, saying, 'It is
for her sake that Kichaka hath lost his life. Let him, therefore, be
cremated along with her. It behoveth thee to grant this permission.'
Thus addressed by them, king Virata, O monarch, knowing fully well the
prowess of the *Suta* gave his assent to *Sairindhri* being burnt along
with the *Suta's* son. And at this, the Kichakas approaching the
frightened and stupefied Krishna of lotus-like eyes, seized her with
violence. And binding that damsel of slender-waist and placing her upon
the bier, they set out with great energy towards the cemetary. And, O
king, while thus forcibly carried towards the cemetary by those sons of
the *Suta* tribe, the blameless and chaste Krishna living under the
protections of her lords, then wailed aloud for the help of her
husbands, saying, 'Oh, let Jaya, and Jayanta, and Vijaya and Jayatsena,
and Jayadvala listen to my words. The *Sutas* are taking me away. Let
those illustrious Gandharvas endued with speed of hand, the clatter of
whose cars is loud and the twang of whose bowstrings in the midst of the
mighty conflict are heard like the roar of thunder, listen to my
words,--the *Sutas* are taking me away!'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Hearing those sorrowful words and lamentations
of Krishna, Bhima, without a moment's reflection started up from his bed
and said, 'I have heard, O *Sairindhri* the words thou hast spoken. Thou
hast, therefore, O timid lady, no more fear at the hands of the *Sutas.*

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said this, the mighty-armed Bhima
desirous of slaying the Kichakas, began to swell his body. And carefully
changing his attire, he went out of the palace by a wrong egress. And
climbing over a wall by the aid of a tree, he proceeded towards the
cemetary whither the Kichakas had gone. And having leapt over the wall,
and gone out of the excellent city, Bhima impetuously rushed to where
the *Sutas* were. And, O monarch, proceeding towards the funeral

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

pyre he beheld a large tree, tall as palmyra-palm, with gigantic
shoulders and withered top. And that slayer of foes grasping with his
arms that tree measuring ten *Vyamas*, uprooted it, even like an
elephant, and placed it upon his shoulders. And taking up that tree with
trunk and branches and measuring ten *Vyamas*, that mighty hero rushed
towards the *Sutas*, like Yama himself, mace in hand. And by the impetus
of his rush <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) banians and peepals and
*Kinsukas* falling down on the earth lay in clusters. And beholding that
Gandharva approach them like a lion in fury, all the *Sutas* trembling
with fear and greatly distressed, became panic-struck. And they
addressed each other, saying, 'Lo, the powerful Gandharva cometh hither,
filled with rage, and with an upraised tree in hand. Let *Sairindhri*,
therefore, from whom this danger of ours hath arisen, be set free.' And
beholding the tree that had been uprooted by Bhimasena, they set
Draupadi free and ran breathlessly towards the city And seeing them run
away, Bhima, that mighty son of the Wind-god, despatched, O foremost of
kings, by means of that tree, a hundred and five of them unto the abode
of Yama, like the wielder of the thunderbolt slaying the Danavas. And
setting Draupadi free from her bonds, he then, O king, comforted her.
And that mighty-armed and irrepressible Vrikodara, the son of Pandu,
then addressed the distressed princess of Panchala with face bathed in
tears, saying, 'Thus, O [timid](errata.htm#7.md) one, are they slain that
wrong thee without cause. Return, O Krishna, to the city. Thou hast no
longer any fear; I myself will go to the Virata's kitchen by another
route.'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'It was thus, O Bharata, that a hundred and
five of those Kichakas were slain. And their corpses lay on the ground,
making the place look like a great forest overspread with uprooted trees
after a hurricane. Thus fell those hundred and five Kichakas. And
including Virata's general slain before, the slaughtered Sutas numbered
one hundred and six. And beholding that exceedingly wonderful feat, men
and women that assembled together, were filled with astonishment. And
the power of speech, O Bharata, was suspended in every one.'"
