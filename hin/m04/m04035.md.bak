# SECTION XXXV

"Vaisampayana said, 'When the king of the Matsyas, anxious of recovering
the kine, had set out in pursuit of the Trigartas, Duryodhana with his
counsellors invaded the dominions of Virata. And Bhishma and Drona, and
Karna, and Kripa acquainted with the best of weapons, Aswatthaman, and
Suvala's son, and Dussasana, O lord of men, and Vivingsati and Vikarna
and Chitrasena endued with great energy, and Durmukha and
Dussaha,--these and many other great warriors, coming upon the Matsya
dominion speedily drove off the cowherds of king Virata and forcibly
took away the kine. And the Kauravas, surrounding all sides with a
multitude of cars, seized sixty thousands of kine. And loud was the yell
of woe set up by the cowherds smitten by those warriors in that terrible
conflict. And the chief of the cowherds, greatly affrighted speedily
mounted on a chariot and set out for the city, bewailing in affliction.
And entering the city of the king, he proceeded to the place, and
speedily alighting from the chariot, got in for relating (what had
happened). And beholding the proud son of Matsya, named Bhuminjaya, he
told him everything about the seizure of the royal kine. And he said,
the Kauravas are taking away sixty thousand kine. Rise, therefore, O
enhancer of the kingdom's glory, for brining back thy cattle. O prince,
if thou art desirous of achieving (the kingdom's) good set out thyself
without loss of time. Indeed, the king of the Matsyas left thee in the
empty city. The king (thy father) boasteth of thee in court, saying, 'My
son, equal unto me, is a hero and is the supporter of (the glory of) my
race. My son is a warrior skilled in arrows and weapons and is always
possessed of great courage.'--Oh, let the words of that lord of men be
true! O chief of herd-owners, bring thou back the kine after vanquishing
the Kurus, and consume thou their troops with the terrific energy of thy
arrows. Do thou like a leader of elephants rushing at a herd, pierce the
ranks of the foe with straight arrows of golden wings, discharged from
thy bow. Thy bow is even like a *Vina*. Its two ends represent the ivory
pillows; its string, the main chord; its staff, the finger-board; and
the arrows shot from it musical notes. Do thou strike in the midst of
the foe that *Vina* of musical sound. <span

steeds, O lord, of silvery hue, be yoked unto thy car, and let thy
standard be hoisted, bearing the emblem of the golden lion. Let thy
keen-edged arrows endued with wings of gold, shot by thy strong arms,
obstruct the path of those kings and eclipse the very sun. Vanquishing
all the Kurus in battle like unto the wielder of the thunderbolt
defeating the *Asuras*, return thou again to the city having achieved
great renown. Son of Matsya's king, thou art the sole refuge of this
kingdom, as that foremost of virtuous warriors, Arjuna is of the sons of
Pandu. Even like Arjuna of his brothers, thou art, without doubt, the
refuge of those dwelling within these dominions. Indeed, we, the subject
of this realm, have our protector in thee.'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the cowherd in the presence
of the females, in words breathing courage, the prince indulging in
self-commendation within the female apartments, spoke these words.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_33"></span>[63:1](m04035.htm#fr_33.md) To understand the
comparison would require in the reader a knowledge of the mechanism of
the Indian Vina. Briefly, the Vina consists of a bamboo of about <span
id="page_64">p. 64</span> cubits attached to two gourds towards its
ends. Along the bamboo which serves the purpose of a finger-board, is
the main chord and several thinner wires. All these pass over a number
of frets, two and a half heptachords, representing the total compass of
the instrument. The wires rest towards their ends on two pieces of ivory
called Upadhanas in Sanskrit or Swaris in Urdu.
