# SECTION XXXVII

"Vaisampayana said, 'Thus despatched by her elder brother, the far-famed
daughter of king Matsya, adorned with a golden necklace, ever obedient
to her brother and possessed of a waist slender as that of the

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

wasp, <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) endued with the splendour of
Lakshmi herself, <span id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36.md) decked with the
plumes of the peacock of slender make and graceful limbs, her hips
encircled by a zone of pearls, her eye-lashes slightly curved, and her
form endued with every grace, hastily repaired to the dancing-hall like
a flash of lightning rushing towards a mass of dark clouds. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[3](#fn_37.md) And the faultless and auspicious daughter
of Virata, of fine teeth and slender-waist, of thighs close unto each
other and each like the trunk of an elephant, her person embellished
with an excellent garland, sought the son of Pritha like a she-elephant
seeking her mate. And like unto a precious gem or the very embodiment of
prosperity of Indra, of exceeding beauty and large eyes, that charming
and adored and celebrated damsel saluted Arjuna. And saluted by her,
Partha asked that maiden of close thighs and golden complexion, saying
'What brings thee hither, a damsel decked in a necklace of gold? Why art
thou in such a hurry, O gazelle-eyed maiden? Why is thy face, O
beauteous lady, so cheerless? Tell me all this without delay!'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Beholding, O king, his friend, the princess of
large-eyes (in that plight), her friend (Arjuna) cheerfully enquired of
her (in these words) the cause of her arrival there and then. And having
approached that bull among men, the princess, standing in the midst of
her female attendants, the displaying proper modesty <span
id="fr_38"></span>[4](#fn_38.md), addressed him, saying, 'The kine of this
realm, O Vrihannala, are being driven away by the Kurus, and it is to
conquer them that my brother will set out bow in hand. Not long ago his
own charioteer was slain in battle, and there is none equal unto the one
slain that can act as my brother's charioteer. And unto him striving to
obtain a charioteer, *Sairindhri*,

O Vrihannala, hath spoken about thy skill in the management of steeds.
Thou wert formerly the favourite charioteer of Arjuna, and it was with
thee that that bull among the sons of Pandu had alone subjugated the
whole earth. Do thou, therefore, O Vrihannala, act as the charioteer of
my brother. (By this time) our kine have surely been driven away by the
Kurus to a great distance. Requested by me if thou dost not

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

act up to my words, I who am asking this service of thee out of
affection, will give up my life!' Thus addressed by this friend of
graceful hips, that oppressor of foes, endued with immeasurable prowess,
went into the prince's presence. And like unto a she-elephant running
after her young one, the princess possessed of large eyes followed that
hero advancing with hasty steps like unto an elephant with rent temples.
And beholding him from a distance, the prince himself said, 'With thee
as his charioteer, Dhananjaya the son of Kunti had gratified *Agni* at
the Khandava forest and subjugated the whole world! The *Sairindhri*
hath spoken of thee to me. She knoweth the Pandavas. Do thou, therefore,
O Vrihannala, hold, as thou didst, the reins of my steeds, desirous as I
am of righting with the Kurus and rescuing my bovine wealth. Thou wert
formerly the beloved charioteer of Arjuna and it was with thee that that
bull among the sons of Pandu had alone subjugated the whole earth!' Thus
addressed, Vrihannala replied unto the prince, saying, 'What ability
have I to act as a charioteer in the field of battle? If it is song or
dance of musical instruments or such other things, I can entertain thee
therewith, but where is my skill for becoming a charioteer?'

"Uttara said, 'O Vrihannala, be thou a singer or a dancer, hold thou
(for the present), without loss of time, the reins of my excellent
steeds, mounting upon my car!'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Although that oppressor of foes, the son of
Pandu, was acquainted with everything, yet in the presence of Uttara, he
began to make many mistakes for the sake of fun. And when he sought to
put the coat of mail on his body by raising it upwards, the large-eyed
maidens, beholding it, burst out into a loud laughter. And seeing him
quite ignorant of putting on armour, Uttara himself equipped Vrihannala
with a costly coat of mail. And casing his own person in an excellent
armour of solar effulgence, and hoisting his standard bearing the figure
of a lion, the prince caused Vrihannala to become his charioteer. And
with Vrihannala to hold his reins, the hero set out, taking with him
many costly bows and a large number of beautiful arrows. And his friend,
Uttara and her maidens then said unto Vrihannala, 'Do thou, O
Vrihannala, bring for our dolls (when thou comest back) various kinds of
good and fine cloths after vanquishing the Kurus assembled for battle of
whom Bhishma and Drona are foremost!' Thus addressed, Partha the son of
Pandu, in a voice deep as the roar of the clouds, smilingly said unto
that bevy of fair maidens. If, thus 'Uttara can vanquish those mighty
warriors in battle, I will certainly bring excellent and beautiful
cloths.'

"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said these words, the heroic Arjuna
urged the steeds towards the Kuru army over which floated innumerable
flags. Just, however, as they were starting elderly dames and maidens,
and Brahmanas of rigid vows, beholding Uttara seated on his excellent
car with Vrihannala as charioteer and under that great banner hoisted on
high, walked round the car to bless the hero. And

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

the women said, 'Let the victory that Arjuna treading like a bull had
achieved of old on the occasion of burning the forest of Khandava, be
thine, O Vrihannala, when thou encounterest the Kurus today with prince
Uttara.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_35"></span>[66:1](m04037.htm#fr_35.md) *Vedi-Vilagna
madhya*--Vedi in this connection means a wasp and not, as explained by
Mallinatha in his commentary of the *Kumarasambhava*, a sacrificial
platform. I would remark in passing that many of the most poetic and
striking adjectives in both the Raghu and the *Kumarasambhava* of
Kalidasa are borrowed unblushingly from the *Ramayana* and the
*Mahabharata*.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[66:2](m04037.htm#fr_36.md) *Padma patrabha-nibha*
may also mean 'of the splendour of the gem called Marakata.' Nilakantha,
however, shows that this would militate against the adjective
*Kankojwalatwacham* below.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[66:3](m04037.htm#fr_37.md) The princess being of
the complexion of burnished gold and Arjuna dark as a mass of clouds,
the comparison is exceedingly appropriate. The Vaishnava poets of Bengal
never tire of this simile in speaking of Radha and Krishna in the groves
of Vrindavana.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[66:4](m04037.htm#fr_38.md) The words in the
original is *pranayam*, lit., love. Nilakantha, however, explains it as
meaning modesty, humility. I think, Nilakantha is right. The relations
between Arjuna and the princess were like those between father and
daughter.
