# SECTION XXIX

"Vaisampayana said, 'Then Saradwata's son, Kripa said, 'What the aged
Bhishma hath said concerning the Pandavas is reasonable, suited to the
occasion, consistent with virtue and profit, agreeable to the ear,
fraught with sound reason, and worthy of him. Listen also to what I
would say on this subject. It behoveth thee to ascertain the track they
have followed and their abode also by means of spies, <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) and to adopt that policy which may bring
about thy welfare. O child, he that is solicitous of his welfare should
not disregard even an ordinary foe. What shall I say, then, O child, of
the Pandavas who are thorough masters of all weapons in battle. When,
therefore, the time cometh for the reappearance of the high-souled
Pandavas, who, having entered the forest, <span
id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md) are now passing their days in close
disguise, thou shouldst ascertain thy strength both in thy own kingdom
and in those of other kings. Without doubt, the return of the Pandavas
is at hand. When their promised term of exile is over, the illustrious
and mighty sons of Pritha, endued with immeasurable prowess, will come
hither bursting with energy. Do thou, therefore, in order to conclude an
advantageous treaty with them, have recourse to sound policy and address
thyself to increase thy forces and improve the treasury. O child,
ascertaining all these, reckon thou thy own strength in respect of all
thy allies weak and strong. <span id="fr_24"></span>[3](#fn_24.md)
Ascertaining the efficiency, and weakness, and indifference of thy
forces, as also who amongst them are well-affected and who are
disaffected, we should either fight the foe or make treaty with him.
Having recourse to the arts of conciliation, disunion, chastisement,
bribery, presents and fair behaviour, attack thy foes and subdue the
weak by might, and win over thy allies and troops and by soft speeches.
When thou hast (by these means) strengthened thy army and filled thy
treasury, entire success will be thine. When thou hast done all this,
thou wilt be able to fight with powerful enemies that may present
themselves, let alone the sons of Pandu deficient in troops animals of
their own. By adopting all these expedients according to the customs of
thy order, thou wilt, O foremost of men, attain enduring happiness in
due time!'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_22"></span>[53:1](m04029.htm#fr_22.md) The word *tirtha* here
means, as Nilakantha rightly explains spies and not holy spots.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[53:2](m04029.htm#fr_23.md) *Satram* is explained
by Nilakantha to mean here 'false disguise.' I think, however, such an
interpretation to be far-fetched. It evidently means 'forest',--the use
of 'pravisteshu' in connection with it almost settles the point.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[53:3](m04029.htm#fr_24.md) This sloka is not
correctly printed in any of the texts that I have seen. The reading that
I adopt is that the second word is the participle of the root *budh* and
not the instrumental of *budhi*; the last word again of the second line
is a compound of *valavatsu* and *avaleshu* instead of (as printed in
many books) *valavatswavaleshu*. Any other reading would certainly be
incorrect. I have not consulted the Bombay text.
