### 8. THE BANDHAS—MYSTIC BREATHING EXERCISES

Among the "secret" aspects of Yoga are the Bandhas, which may be
translated roughly as breathing exercises. After the body has been
prepared by thorough practice in the different *asanas* and clarified by
the breathing exercises, the Yogi is ready for the Bandhas. These may
not be attained immediately, since they depend on a full state of body
and mental relaxation for successful attainment.

#### Uddiana Bandha

By a very strong expiration, the lungs are emptied and driven against
the upper part of the thorax, carrying the diaphragm along with them.
The intestines are thereby taken up to fill the empty space, and the
stomach is made so slender that it might be encompassed by the span of a
hand.

#### Jalandhara Bandha

Contract your throat and press your chin firmly against your breast
about four inches from the heart.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

#### The "Secret" Mudras

The ancient Sanskrit tract, the *Hatha Yoga Pradipika* of Swatmaram
Swami, describes the ten *mudras* which bring great powers to advanced
students of Yoga. While these are described as being sought after as the
goal of Yoga, they are seldom achieved. According to the tract: "They
are much sought after by all Siddhas (possessors of Yogic power) and are
difficult to obtain even by the Devas (lesser gods)." However, they may
be of interest to the Western reader who seeks relaxation through Yoga.
While practice of the Secret Mudras may not result in the attainment of
the ultimate goals described, it may prove beneficial as another outlet
for tension.

According to Hindu sages, the ten *mudras* destroy old age and death,
having been given out by the god Siva, and also confer the eight
*siddhis* or miraculous powers. The old text enjoins the student to
secrecy, saying, "This should be carefully kept secret as a box of
diamonds and should not be told to anybody—just as the illicit
connection with a married woman of noble family." Descriptions of the
ten *mudras* follow.

#### Maha Mudra

Pressing the anus with the left heel and stretching the left leg, take
hold of the toes with your hand. Then practice the Jalandhara Bandha
(described above), and draw your breath through the *susumna* (the space
behind the navel). Then the *kundalini* (the sleeping goddess within the
internal organs) becomes straight, just as a coiled snake does when
struck, and the *ida* (left nostril) and *pingala* (right nostril)

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

become dead, because the breath goes out of them. Then the breath should
be let out slowly, never quickly.

#### Maha Bandha

Having restrained your breath as long as possible, breathe out slowly.
Practice first on the left side, then on the right. This is said to stop
the upward course of the breath through the *nadis* (nerves) except
*susumna* (spinal cord), bring about the union of them with the
*susumna* and enable the mind to remain fixed between the two eyebrows.
The above two *mudras* are described as having limited value without a
third, called the Maha Vedha.

#### Maha Vedha

Draw in your breath with a concentrated mind and stop the upward and
downward course of breath by the Jalandhara Bandha. Sitting on the
ground with your body on your hands, gently seat and raise yourself
repeatedly. Then breathe out. The body assumes a deathlike aspect in
this exercise.

#### Kechari Mudra

This is not likely to appeal to the Westerner seeking beneficial aspects
of Yoga. This *mudra* requires the following preparation: By slight
daily cutting, continued for six months, the ligament which holds down
the tongue is severed. By repeated pulling, the tongue is made long
enough to reach the eyebrows. The *mudra* is performed by turning the
tongue up and in, so that it enters the hole in the palate where the
three *nadis* (nerves) join. Simultaneously, the eyes should be fixed
firmly between the brows.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

#### Vajroli Mudra

Said to give five Siddhis, even to one who lives an ordinary life, along
with the *amaroli* and *sahajoli*, which are linked with it, this
*mudra* occupies another 20 *sutras*, or verses, which are almost
impossible to translate into English because of their mystic character.
The commentary on the Sanskrit text says that they are not to be
understood literally. Further, they are incomplete in some points which
are left to be filled by verbal instructions from the *guru*, or Yoga
teacher or leader.

#### Shakati Chalana

Named as the last of the ten *mudras*, this is described as follows:
Having inhaled through the right nostril, the practitioner should retain
his breath and "manipulate the *kundalini* for about an hour and a half,
both at morning and evening twilights." The Sanskrit text states:

"As one forces open the door with a key, so should the Yogi force open
the door of *moksha* (state of bliss) by the *kundalini*. The
*kundalini* gives *mukti* (deliverance) to the Yogis and bondage to the
fools. He who knows her, knows Yoga. He who causes that *shakti* (the
*kundalini*) to move (from the *muladhara* in the pelvic region upwards)
is freed without doubt. Between the *ganges* (*ida*) and *jamuna*
(*pingala*) there sits the young widow inspiring pity. He (the Yogi)
should despoil her forcibly, for it leads one to the supreme seat of
Vishnu. You should awaken the sleeping serpent (*kundalini*) by taking
told of its tail. Seated in the *vajrasena* posture, firmly take hold of
the ankle and slowly beat with them the *kanda* \[a something below the
navel from

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

which the 72,000 *nadis* issue\]. By moving the *kundalini* fearlessly
for about an hour and a half, she is drawn upwards a little through the
*susumna*," which process, it is claimed, "surely opens the mouth of the
*susumna* and the breath naturally goes through it." Whether this effect
is produced by manipulation of the *kundalini* or other means, it seems
to be the object primarily aimed at in Hatha Yoga practice. The fruits
of the practice of Hatha Yoga, taken in the order of their mention in
the texts, are:

I. The eight *siddhis*: *anima* (the power to assimilate oneself with an
atom); *mahima* (the power to expand oneself into space); *laghima* (the
power to be as light as cotton or any similar thing); *garima* (the
power to be as heavy as anything); *prapti* (the power of reaching
anywhere, even to the moon); *prakamya* (the power of having all wishes,
of whatever description, realized); *isvata* (power to create);
*vasvita* (power to command all).

2\. Freedom from death and old age.

3\. Rejuvenescence and perpetual youth.

4\. Beauty.

5\. Ability to "do and undo."

6\. Exemption from hunger, thirst and indolence.

7\. Ability to float on water.

8\. Attainment of anything in the three worlds.

9\. Invulnerability of wrinkles and gray hair.

10\. Removal of wrinkles and gray hair.

11\. Freedom from disease.

12\. Exemption from the effects of Karma. (See Glossary.)

13\. Immortality and the eight *siddhis* named above.

14\. Power to attract the other sex.

Finally, and beyond the *siddhis*, comes the grand result of *mukti*, or
emancipation from rebirth, and the conscious

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

junction with Brahman. These powers are certainly all that could be
desired; in fact, they stop nothing short of omnipotence, omnipresence
and omniscience, but we must allow for the ever-pervading Eastern
hyperbole, and for the mystical superstructure of the ancient Hindu
school of physiology.
