### IV.

### MĀṆIKKA VĀSAHAR

(Sanskrit form MĀṆIKYA VĀCHAKA)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the days when the powerful Pāndyan
Kings flourished in Madura, there was once a prime minister who early
became convinced of the transitoriness of this world's life and its
riches. When on a visit to Perundurai, now Āvudaiyārkoil in the Tanjore
District, he suddenly and completely came under the influence of a
Brahman religious teacher, who for him was the manifestation of the very
God Himself. Then and there he began to sing the "Sacred Utterance"
(Tiruvāsaham), and was named by his preceptor "Utterer of Jewels"
(Māṇikka Vāsahar). Returning to Madura, he forsook his high office with
all its rewards, to become a religious poet wandering without earthly
attachments from shrine to shrine. The stories clustering around his
religious experience can be read by English readers in Dr. Pope's great
edition of his work. We find him practising austerities at Chidambaram,
or miraculously giving the gift of speech to the dumb daughter of the
Chōl̤a king, or defeating in disputation a band of Buddhists from Ceylon,
but of certain historical information about him we have practically
none. Even the question of the century in which he lived is a
battleground of the antiquarians. Tradition places him in the fifth
century, earlier than the writers of the Dēvāram;

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

but the opinion of scholars seems to be converging on the view that he
lived in the latter half of the ninth, or the first half of the tenth
century of our era. Another of his works is the Tirukkōvaiyār, an erotic
poem of four hundred stanzas. Among Tamil Śaivite writers none makes a
stronger devotional appeal than Māṇikka Vāsahar. There is a common Tamil
saying that nothing can melt the heart of the man who is not melted by
the Tiruvāsaham.

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span> <span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

Stanzas 80-92 are samples from an opening poem of one hundred stanzas,
each ten of which has its own metre and is fairly complete in itself.
They fairly reflect the saint's varying moods. Notice the importance he
attaches to emotion; his worst self-reproach is for feeling no frenzy.
As to his conception of God, see how the word 'grace' recurs in nearly
every stanza. And yet that God of grace is called (in No. 84) both being
and non-existence.

##### <span class="smallcaps">The Hundred Verses</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

80\. Thrills and trembles my frame;  
Hands are lifted on high;  
Here at Thy fragrant feet,  
Sobbing and weeping I cry;  
Falsehood forsaking, I shout,  
"Victory, victory, praise!  
Lord of my life, these clasped hands  
Worship shall bring Thee always.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

81\. Indra or Vishṇu or Brahm,  
Their divine bliss crave not I;  
I seek the love of Thy saints,  
Though my house perish thereby.  
To the worst hell I will go,  
So but Thy grace be with me.  
Best of all, how could my heart  
Think of a god beside Thee?

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

82\. Though like Thy saints I seem, ’tis but the acting of a part.  
Yet wondrous swift I run to reach the heaven where Thou art.  
O hill of gold and precious gems, grant in Thy grace to me  
A heart to melt, lord of my life, in ceaseless love to Thee.

</div>

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span> <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

83\. I have no fear of births, but quake at thought that I must die.  
E’en heav’n to me were naught; for earth's whole empire what care I?  
O Śiva wreathed with honeyed blossoms, "When shall come the morn  
When Thou wilt grant Thy grace to me?" I cry with anguish torn.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

84\. The sky, earth, wind, the light, our very flesh and life art
Thou,  
Being art Thou, non-being too, Thou king, who see’st how  
Men dance like puppets with their foolish thoughts of 'I' and 'Mine,'  
While Thou the cords dost pull. What words can tell Thy praise divine?

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

85\. At sound of cries like this, "O Bull-rider whose spreading hair  
The falling stream receives! "Heaven's Lord," true devotees there
were,  
Whose love-thrilled heart broke forth, like stopped-up rivers rushing
down.  
Yet Thou didst choose no one of them, but me to be Thine own.  
And yet my body will not turn from heel to head one heart  
To melt in love for Thee, one eye to shed the tears that smart  
In swelling floods. Ah! wretched that I am, who only moan!  
My two eyes are unfeeling wood, my heart a great dead stone!

</div>

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span> <span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

86\. Amid the fruits of deeds I lay. Thou didst thyself reveal  
With words of comfort saying "Come, I will destruction deal  
To evil fruit of deeds," and thus thou mad’st me all Thy slave.  
And yet I stand as if a statue made of steel, nor rave,  
Nor sing, nor cry, nor wail—woe's me—nor in my spirit faint  
With deep desire, so dull am I. O being ancient,  
Thou art beginning, Thou art end: tell me, how can I be  
So dead at heart? The end if this I do not dare to see.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

87\. Him though men seek, none fully know; in Him no evil is.  
None are His kindred; knowledge perfect, effortless is His.  
A cur am I, yet He hath giv’n to me in sight of men  
A place on earth, and shewed me things far beyond mortal ken.  
He told me what no ears can hear; from future births He sav’d.  
Such magic wrought my Lord who me hath lovingly enslaved.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

88\. Our God of gods, whom e’en the devas’ king knows but in part,  
Ruleth the three who in the fair world-gardens life impart,  
And life maintain, and life destroy; our First, Reality,  
Father of old, whose consort Umā is, our sovereign, He <span
id="page_94">p. 94</span> <span id="page_95">p. 95</span>  
Came down in grace and made e’en me to be His very own.  
Henceforth before no man I bow; I fear but Him alone.  
Now of His servants’ servants I have joined the sacred throng,  
And ever more and more I'll bathe in bliss. with dance and song.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

89\. The meanest cur am I; I know not how to do the right;  
’Twere but what I deserve, should’st Thou my wickedness requite  
With the dread fate of those who never saw Thy flowery feet;  
For though mine eyes have seen, my ears have heard saints guileless,
meet,  
Who reached Thy fragrant presence, yet I stay, for false am I,  
Fit for naught save to eat and dress, Lion of victory.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

90\. None but myself has sunk myself. Thy name be ever praised!  
No blame lay I on Thee, lauds to my Master be upraised!  
Yet to forgive is aye a mark of greatness. Praise to Thee!  
Lord of the land celestial, Praise! O end this life for me.

</div>

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span> <span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

91\. The fawn-eyed maid is part of Thee! From holy writ Thou’rt hid!  
Thou’rt honey, yea ambrosia, by man's mind not compassèd.  
O king who bearest with my faults, some harsh words did I say.  
Thy saints have entered heaven. Without, falsehood and I still stay.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

92\. Since I am false, and false my heart, and false my very love,  
Howe’er I weep, still held by deed can I reach Thee above?  
O honey, nectar, O essential sweetness, great as sweet,  
Grant grace to me to find the path that leads unto Thy feet.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

93\. Heav’n, earth, and all that therein is, thou makest without seed.  
Thou dost preserve and Thou destroy. ’Tis Thou who hast decreed  
That I though treacherous, mean, should be a man who frenzied faints  
Before Thy temple gates, one with the band of Thy true saints.  
What men themselves have planted, e’en a poisonous mango tree,  
They root not up. O Lord of mine, as such a tree keep me.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our next five stanzas, taken from a hymn of fifty, are full of the
pathos expressed in the title, which is a refrain recurring in every
verse. Only flashes of the light of the presence of God pierce the
prevailing gloom. The saint cannot free himself from sensuality,

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

even while he hates it. He wonders whether even the God who drank poison
for others’ sake will leave him alone.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Wilt Thou Leave Me?</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

94\. Mingling in grace with me, O rider of the bull, Thou mad’st me
Thine.  
  But wilt Thou leave me? Thou whose form in the fierce tiger's skin is
clad,  
Uttarakōsamaṅgai old has Thee for king. O lord of mine  
  With matted hair, hold Thou me up; for I am weary grown and sad.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

95\. Set in the marge of flowing stream that eats its banks away, the
tree  
  Shakes to its fall; and thus am I, my sense bewitch’d by maids’ dark
eyes.  
Uttarakōsamaṅgai's king, spouse of gem-vested Pārvati,  
  Who dwell'st in Ārūr holy, O protector, for my help arise.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

96\. In ignorance I spurned thy grace. Dost Thou, my gem, now me
despise,  
  And wilt thou leave me? O destroy my sum of deeds and make me thine.  
Uttarakōsamaṅgai's king, ’tis surely true, the great and wise,  
  When only little curs play false, to mercy ever will incline.

</div>

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

97\. With none to cheer me from my fear, far have I wandered wearily,  
  O Lightning-like, and wilt Thou leave me? If I truly thee compare,  
Uttarakōsamaṅgai's king, I find naught else resembling Thee;  
  But a true father, mother dear art Thou to me, my treasure rare.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

98\. Whether I praise or curse Thee, still I'm stained with sin and
sorrowing.  
  Yet, wilt Thou leave me? Splendour shining like the red-hued coral
mount,  
Master, thou drankest poison black, the humbler beings pitying,  
  That I, Thy meanest one, might find no poison, but a nectar fount.

</div>

Our poet made songs which maidens might sing in their rhythmical games,
or as they sat at the grinding-stone. In India the boatman sings as he
rows, the ryot sings as he draws from the well, the sepoy sings on his
march. A feature of such songs is the refrain, which is usually a mere
collection of euphonic syllables, though it may have a meaning. Here are
specimens of a few songs intended for women. The refrain of the first,
"Ēlōrembāvāy" probably means "Receive and ponder what I say, O lady."
The Grinding song, strangely enough, is used at funerals, as also is the
'Antiphony.' The song of 'The Three Castles’ Destruction' is supposed to
accompany play with a ball or a kind of shuttle called 'undī.' For the
legend of the Three Castles, see page [7](htss02.htm#page_7.md). 'The
Shoulder-Play' is for some ancient game in which women grasped each
other's shoulders.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Song of the Maidens</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

99\. Older are Thou than the oldest of all,  
Newest of all that is new.  
At Thy saints’ feet we in service will fall,  
We are Thy handmaidens true.  
None but Thy bondsmen shall call us their own;  
Lord, we would none others wed;  
We would be slaves at their bidding alone:  
So be our bliss perfected.  
Ēlōrembāvāy.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

100\. "Sure for Thy child there is refuge with Thee,"  
Trembling we take up the cry.  
Hear, O our Lord, while we bring Thee one plea,  
Grant but one boon for our joy.  
May only Thy lovers rest on our breast,  
Let our hands’ labour be theirs.  
Only on such our eyes night and day rest,  
Then sun rise west, east, who cares?  
Ēlōrembāvāy.

</div>

##### <span class="smallcaps">The Grinding Song</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

101\. Grind we the powder gold, that He may bathe;  
For He is Scripture, He is sacrifice;  
He's being's truth, and being's falsehood too;  
Light is He, yea, and He is darkness deep;  
He is deep sorrow, and true bliss is He;  
He is the half, and He again the whole;  
Bondage is He, but He is true release;  
He is the alpha, He the omega.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

102\. "His form is smeared with ashes white; the snake His strange
adornment is;  
The secret scriptures utters He: what kind of god, my friend, is this?  
"Why talk of ash-smear, holy speech, adornment strange? This only
know,  
This god, of every living thing is the true nature. Chāḷalō."

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

103\. "My father and my master, He of all men Lord supreme, is clad  
With but a hanging loin-cloth stitched; pray tell me, friend, is He not
mad?  
"The Vedas four with meaning fraught, the everlasting Śāstras, know  
That these are but the threads whereof is wove His loin-cloth. Chāḷalō."

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

104\. The burning-ground's His temple fine; the tiger's skin His raiment
is;  
Father or mother hath He none; He's all alone; my friend, see this.''  
"Though He no parents hath, no kin, yet should His anger kindle, lo,  
The whole wide world would straightway turn to dust and ashes. Chāḷalō."

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

105\. "Though I am but a cur, yet when I turned to Him who hath no
end,  
Into a sea of bliss He made me sink o’erwhelmed; see this, my friend."  
"Those holy feet that sank thee in the sea of bliss o’erwhelmèd, know,  
E’en to the very gods in heav’n they're richest treasure. Chāḷalō."

In the poetry of all lands lovers have appealed to birds to be their
messengers to the distant loved one. This is so common in Indian poetry
as to have become a recognised convention. Here the saint sends his
message of love and devotion, in one case by a humming bee, in the other
by the Indian cuckoo, to Śiva who dwells in Tillai, i.e. Chidambaram.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

110\. Hard-hearted thief, stiff-necked was I, but no such name He called
me;  
My stony heart He melted, and by mercy He enthralled me.  
The swans abound in Tillai's lovely hall of gold, His dwelling.  
Fly, king of bees, at His gold anklets hum, my message telling.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

111\. Cur though I am, my lord has set me His great glory singing;  
To me, the mad, His patient grace is aye forgiveness bringing;  
Scorning me not, He deigns to take the service I can do Him.  
Mother and God. Go, king of bees, hum thou my message to Him.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

112\. Far would my heart and mind have gone from Him, but He compelled
me,  
The lord with tangled locks, and His fair spouse, they saved and held
me.  
He is the sky, the mighty sea, east, west, north, south, indwelling.  
His feet with honey drop. There, king of bees, my praise be telling.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

113\. In this world's treasure false immersed lay I, and
self-deceivèd,  
Held it for treasure true, but for His own He me receivèd.  
My precious life itself is He, in Tillai's hall abiding.  
Go, king of bees, at His red lotus feet my words confiding.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

114\. Hear, little cuckoo in the honey’d orchard groves.  
Heav’n did He spurn; to save us men, to earth He calve,  
Boundless in giving, reeking naught of flesh of mine,  
Entered my mind, and there my very thought became.  
He, the alone, the spouse of her whose pure eye's ray  
Shames the gazelle in softness, call Him hither, pray.

One of the little childishnesses involved in idolatry is that every
morning with solemn ceremony the idol must be wakened from his sleep,
bathed, and dressed. Here is a song with which he is roused from
slumber. But notice how successfully our author has filled his poem with
the fresh morning feeling, and the sights and sounds of the sudden break
of the Indian dawn.

##### <span class="smallcaps">The Idol's Awakening</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

115\. Hail to Thee, treasure rare,  
  Source of all prosperity,  
Dawn has come, at Thy feet,

  Smiles that blossom fair and sweet  
In Thy face, as we fall  
  Prone adoring at Thy feet.

Now O Lord of us all,

Eyes unclose from their sleep,

Mountain-joy, ocean-bliss,

117\. Cocks now crow to the morn,  
  While the cuckoos loudly call;  
Little birds sweetly sing,

Light of stars fades away  
  Into common light of day;  
Dawn and sun come as one,  
  Now to us, O God, display

In Thy love Thy twin feet,  
  Gracious, decked with anklets rare.  
Śiva, Lord, dweller in Holy Perunduṛai fair,

  Wreaths of many blossoms wove;  
Some bow down, some men weep,

Clasping hands o’er their heads,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

124\. In Thee she dwells whose ancient praise is faultless;  
  See how I have no other help but Thee.  
Thou king of S\`iva's world, the bright moon wearing,  
  Dweller in Perunduṛai, look on me.  
Whom save Thee could I worship with my praises?  
  Can any other refuge give for me?  
O Rider of the bull, my life is joyless.  
  Now let Thy grace speak, bid me come to Thee.

</div>

##### <span class="smallcaps">The Balancing of Deeds</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

125\. O lord of Perunduṛai, place of peace,  
  To them who call Thy name, beyond compare  
True joy art Thou. Thou mad'st my woe to cease  
  When good and ill deeds done were balanced fair.  
    Then lest unwith’ring seeds of birth should grow,  
    In Kal̤ukunḍu Thy fair self didst shew.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Life's Consuming</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

126\. Myself I cannot understand, nor what is day nor night;  
He who both word and thought transcends has reft my senses quite,  
He who for bull has Vishṇu, and in Perunduṛai dwells,  
O Light supreme, in Brāhman guise has cast on me strange spells.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

127\. I ask not fame, wealth, earth or heav’n. No birth, no death for
me.  
None will I touch who love not Śiva. Now ’tis mine to see  
Abiding Perunduṛai, wear the King's foot as my crown;  
Never will I leave this His shrine, nor let Him leave His own.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

128\. Art Thou like honey on the branch too high for me to climb?  
Or art Thou nectar ocean-churned? O Hara, King sublime,  
In Perunduṛai, circled with moist fields, I can set Thee  
With form ash-smeared, the spotless. Can I bear my ecstasy?

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

129\. Many in this great earth who live do penance; I alone  
Bearing this frame of flesh, a barren jungle-tree have grown.  
Dweller in Perunduṛai old where blooms the kondai tree,  
May I the sinner cry "Wilt Thou not grant Thyself to me"?

##### <span class="smallcaps">Pious Fear</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

130\. I fear not serpents lurking smooth;  
I fear no liars’ feignèd truth;  
But when I see fools venturing  
E’en to the foot of Him our king,  
Our three-eyed Lord with matted hair,  
Of His great godhead unaware,  
Fools thinking other gods can be,  
Terror such sight inspires in me.

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

131\. I fear no javelin's gory blade;  
Nor sidelong glance of bangled maid;  
But when I see men void of grace  
Drinking no sweetness from the praise  
Of my unchiselled Gem, whose dance  
In Tillai's hail is seen, whose glance  
Melts men's whole frame in ecstasy  
Terror such sight inspires in me.

</div>

##### <span class="smallcaps">I Cling to Thee</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

132\. King of the heavenly ones! All-filling Excellence!  
E’en to vile me Thou Thy wonders hast shown;  
Balm of true bliss, ending false earthly bliss of sense,  
Thou my whole household did’st take for Thine own.  
Meaning of holy writ! Wondrous Thy glory!  
True wealth, our Śiva, to Thee, Lord, I cling.  
Never to loose my hold, firmly I cling to Thee;  
Where canst Thou go, leaving me sorrowing?

</div>

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span> <span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

133\. King of celestial ones, ever with bull for steed,  
Evil am I, yet my riches art Thou;  
Lest I should rot in my foul flesh, and die indeed,  
Thou hast preserved me, and Thine am I now.  
Thou art our God; Thou of grace art a boundless sea,  
Saved from my flesh, now to Thee, Lord, I cling.  
Never to let Thee loose, firmly I cling to Thee;  
Where can’st Thou go, leaving me sorrowing?

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

134\. Thou dids’t come into my vile fleshly body,  
E’en as ’twere into some great golden shrine;  
Soft’ning and melting it all, Thou hast savèd me,  
Lord condescending, Thou gem all divine!  
Sorrow and birth, death, all ties that deceivèd me,  
Thou did’st remove, all my bonds severing;  
True bliss, our kindly Light, firmly I cling to Thee;  
Where canst Thou go leaving me sorrowing?

</div>

##### <span class="smallcaps">NAUGHT BUT THY LOVE</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

135\. I ask not kin, nor name, nor place,  
  Nor learnèd men's society.  
Men's lore for me no value has;  
  Kuttālam's lord, I come to Thee.  
Wilt thou one boon on me bestow,  
  A heart to melt in longing sweet,  
As yearns o’er new-horn calf the cow,  
  In yearning for Thy sacred feet?

</div>

##### <span class="smallcaps">Longing for Union</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

136\. I had no virtue, penance, knowledge, self-control. A doll to
turn  
  At others’ will I danced, whirled, fell. But me He filled in every
limb  
With love's mad longing, and that I might climb there whence is no
return,  
  He shewed His beauty, made me His. Ah me, when shall I go to Him?

</div>

##### <span class="smallcaps">The Wonder of Grace</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

137\. Fool's friend was I, none such may know  
  The way of freedom; yet to me  
He shew’d the path of love, that so  
  Fruit of past deeds might ended be.  
    Cleansing my mind so foul, He made me like a god.  
    Ah who could win that which the Father hath bestowed?

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

138\. Thinking it right, sin's path I trod;  
  But, so that I such paths might leave,  
And find His grace, the dancing God,  
  Who far beyond our thought doth live,  
    O wonder passing great!—to me His dancing shewed.  
    Ah who could win that which the Father hath bestowed?
