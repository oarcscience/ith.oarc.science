### INTRODUCTION

### (A)—The Hymns and their Significance

THE voice of chanting and song, to the accompaniment of unfamiliar
instruments, floats out over the high wall of the temple in the coolness
of the evening or the dawn, making the Western passer-by wonder what it
is that is being chanted and sung. If only he had a Hindu hymn-book he
thinks he could learn from it the spirit of Hinduism as well as a
non-Christian could learn Christianity from Christian hymns. For the
Tamil country at any rate there *is* such a hymnbook, and our present
aim is to give enough specimens from it for readers to know what the
hymns are like. Englishmen are wanting to understand India more than
they ever wanted before, for their debt to India is heavy. Indians are
wanting more than ever before to know the wonderful past of their own
country, and the wonder of it is all bound up with its religion. At such
a time these hymns are worth looking into, for they are being sung in
temples and homes throughout the Tamil country, and Tamil is the
mother-tongue of more than eighteen millions of people. For pious
Śaivites they equal in authority the Sanskrit Vedas; the mere learning
of them by rote is held to be a virtue, and devout. Tamil parents compel
their children to memorize them in much the same way as Christian
parents make their children learn the Psalms.

The hymns here given are specimens from the Dēvāram and the
Tiruvāchakam. The Dēvāram is the first of the collections of works held
as canonical by Tamil Śaivites. Its hymns were composed between six and
eight hundred A.D. by the three authors of whom this book gives some
account, and the whole was put together in one collection of 797 stanzas
by Nambi Āṇḍār Nambi about 1000 A.D. The Tiruvāchakam, or Sacred
Utterance, was written by one author, Māṇikya Vāchaka (Tamilized as
Māṇikka Vāsahar) at a date so far unsettled that scholars are still
divided on the question whether it preceded or followed the Dēvāram,
though most scholars place it in the ninth, or early in the tenth,
century. Whenever it was written, it stands even higher than the Dēvāram
in the affections of Tamil people.

Out of an immense number of hymns we have tried to select those which
are most representative, those which are favourites, and those which
contain the most striking thoughts. But it is amazingly difficult to
give a fair or adequate idea of them in an English rendering. They are
essentially songs, intended to be sung to Indian tunes, in metres which
no English metre can represent. Much of their charm depends upon
assonance, upon plays upon words, upon close knitting of word with word,
upon intricacy of metre and rhyme, almost as much as upon the substance.
We can only claim a fair degree of accuracy in our renderings,
apologizing to the lovers of Tamil poetry for the plainness and poverty
of our representation of so rich and varied an original. All our
translations are new, and nearly all of those from the Dēvāram represent
verses which have never before been done

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

into English. One of the translators of this book learned as Śaivite
child to love these hymns, and therefore is the authority in matters of
interpretation, the Englishman being responsible for the form. We shall
be quite satisfied if our translations serve to call attention to the
poems, and are some day replaced by worthier renderings.

We have tried to reduce introductory matter to a minimum, only giving
such information as is necessary to enable readers to understand the
hymns and the allusions in them. But it is entirely necessary to say
something about the worship of Śiva, and to give a few words of
biography of each of the four authors from whose work this book contains
extracts.

##### (B)—The Worship of Śiva

1\. *Its history previous to these poems*.

The word Śiva occurs even in the Rig Veda, but there it is only in
conjunction with Rudra. The joining together of these names provokes
conjectures as to whether we have here an amalgamation of two earlier
deities, an Aryan and a Dravidian, but these need not detain us here,
since clearly even at this early date Śiva was an Aryan deity, identical
with Rudra the storm-god, and father of the Maruts, storm-gods
themselves. Rudra is a handsome god; he uses his thunderbolts chiefly
for punishing evil-doers, and is on the whole a kindly being. The name
Śiva means auspicious,' and must not be confused with the Tamil word for
'red,' although as it happens Rudra-Śiva was a red being,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

In the period of the Purāṇas, we find that Śiva, instead of being one of
a multitude of nature-deities, has risen to be one of the great triad,
Brahmā, Vishṇu, and Śiva, who are far above all gods. How the change has
come about we have not yet the means of discovering. The function has
changed as much as the person, Śiva being now the destroyer as Brahmā is
the creator and Vishṇu the preserver. The process of reduction in the
number of the superior deities goes further, and Brahmā falls
practically into the background, leaving only Vishṇu and Śiva as supreme
beings for the worship of the people of India. By the time Hinduism
penetrated southwards into the Tamil country, probably somewhere about
500 B.C., it had two main forms, the worship of Vishṇu and the worship
of Śiva, the two being not too sharply disconnected. The Tamil Hindu
believed in the existence of both, but held his own god, whether Śiva or
Vishṇu, to be supreme. Hinduism seemed to be Firmly established, but was
dangerously shaken when the Jains and Buddhists spread over South India.
Then came for the Vaishṇavites the teachers known as the Āl̤vārs, while
Śaivism was defended by the poets of whose work this book gives
specimens. Hinduism was saved, but it existed henceforth in two distinct
forms, Vaishṇavism and Śaivism, separated by a wider gulf than in
earlier days.

2\. *The portrait of Śiva and its interpretation*.

Śiva as imagined by his worshippers has a human form, usually with one
but occasionally with five or six heads. He has three eyes, the right
one being really the sun, the left eye the moon, and the one in the
middle of his forehead fire, His reddish hair is

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

matted in the ascetic way, and on it is the crescent moon, the Ganges,
and one or more cobras, while wreathed about it is a garland of konḍai
(Cassia) flowers. He has four arms, though occasional representations
show eight, but one body and two legs. Commonly he is seated on a
grey-coloured bull. In colour he is reddish, but his body is smeared
over with white sacred ash. He holds in his hands various things such as
a battle-axe, a deer, fire, a trident, a bow. Round his neck, which is
dark, hangs a long necklace, the beads of which are skulls. At his waist
he wears sometimes an elephant's hide, sometimes a tiger-skin, sometimes
only a very scanty loin-cloth. Generally his consort, Umā, is at his
left side, but sometimes he is pictured as half man and half woman, the
right half (Śiva) being pink-coloured, and the left half (Umā) green or
black. Śiva's abode is said to be on Mount Kailāsa in the Himālayas, but
among his special haunts is the burning-ground, where bodies are
cremated. One of the favourite manifestations of Śiva is that as
Naṭarāja, the dancer in the great hall at Chidambaram, of which we give
a picture (see [frontispiece](htss00.htm#img_front).md). Here Śiva has one
face, four arms, and two legs, performing a spirited dance. His right
foot rests on a demon named Muyalahan. He is sometimes represented as
dancing along with Kāḷī, not the Kāḷī who in North India is identified
with Umā, but a she-devil feared in the South.

Doubtless each of these features in the manifestation of Śiva has its
history, but that is unknown at present. The legends give fanciful
explanations of most of them. The tiger's skin and the elephant's hide,
for instance, are those which Śiva stripped from the wild animals sent
against him by the magic of his

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

enemies the ṛishis of Darukāvana. But it is of more interest to find the
religious ideas which these things suggest to a thoughtful Śaivite
devotee to-day. The hides remind him that Śiva has all power, and all
opposition to him is vain. That right foot of Naṭarāja set on Muyalahan
means that God crushes down all evil. Those skulls in his necklace are
the skulls of successive Brahmās, each of whom died after a life lasting
many ages. This is a way of saying that while other gods at last come to
their end, Śiva is eternal and unchanging. Śiva's dance suggests how
easily, and how rhythmically, he performs his five functions of making,
preserving, destroying, judging and purifying. And his dance in the
burning-ground may sometimes carry the message that God becomes most
real to men in the solemn hour when they part from their dead.

3\. *Four common legends and their meaning*.

Of the many legends concerning Śiva four are so frequently alluded to in
our poems that they should be told here, to avoid repeated explanatory
notes.

1\. Brahmā and Vishṇu once saw a pillar of fire that seemed to grow from
the depths of the earth and to pierce beyond the highest heavens. They
longed to learn its depth and height, and agreed that Brahmā should
become a swan to fly to the pillar's top, and Vishṇu a boar to dig to
its root. The swan flew up to the sky, but never reached the pillar's
summit. The boar dug through the earth with his tusk, but never found
where the pillar began. Brahmā and Vishṇu perforce acknowledged their
limitations and prayed to the pillar, whereupon Śiva revealed himself,
for the pillar was a form he had assumed. Not even the greatest and

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

wisest of creatures can by their searching find out God. But to the
humble-hearted He reveals Himself.

2\. Rāvaṇa, the ten-headed giant king of Ceylon, while on his conquering
progress through many realms, came to the North of India and saw Kailāsa
the silver mountain. Coveting its beauty he determined to uproot and
transplant it to his own island. With his ten heads and twenty arms he
tried to lift it from the earth, and Kailāsa shook. All the hosts of
heaven, and even Irma., were terrified by what seemed to them an awful
earthquake. But Śiva simply set his big toe upon the mountain, and lo,
Rāvaṇa found himself being crushed to death. Repenting of his folly,
Rāvaṇa prayed for mercy, and Śiva not only forgave him but even gave him
fresh boons. For God pardons sinners who repent, and gives them
blessings which before they did not know.

3\. Three Asuras, or supernatural beings, once by doing penance obtained
from Śiva three castles, one of gold, one of silver, and one of iron.
These castles could fly at the owners' desire, and settle down on towns
and villages, destroying many lives. In course of time the Asuras became
very proud and ignored Śiva. Determining to punish them, Śiva mounted a
chariot whose wheels were the sun and moon and whose scat was the earth.
Brahmā was his charioteer, the four Vedas the horses, Mount Meru his
bow, the ancient serpent Ādiśesha his bow-string, and Vishṇu his arrow.
At sight of these preparations the gods became conceited, thinking that
Śiva could not destroy his enemies without them. Śiva knowing their
thoughts simply laughed, and at that laugh the three castles were on the
instant reduced to ashes.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

Those who forget God in their pride must be punished. When those whom
God uses as his instruments begin to think themselves indispensable to
him, he shews that his purposes can be fulfilled without them.

4\. The gods once began to churn the ocean in the hope of obtaining
divine nectar. The mountain Mandāra was their churning-stick, the
primeval tortoise the pivot on which the stick rested and turned, and
the serpent Vāsuki was the churning-rope. As they churned, at first,
great and splendid things came up. But suddenly something black rose up
and darkened the whole universe. It was a mass of poison, deadly alike
to gods and men. In terror of destruction, the gods and demons called on
Śiva. He came, drank the poison, and saved them all. That which was
enough to destroy the universe could only stain his throat with a bluish
colour. That is why Śiva is often called the "poison-necked" or
"blue-throated" god. There is a link here, small but real, with the
Christian teaching of God as ready to suffer for the sake of humbler
beings.
