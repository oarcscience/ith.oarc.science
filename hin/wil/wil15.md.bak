# CHAPTER XIII

### THE GOSPEL OF THE BLESSED ONE

We worship Thee, Seed of the Universe,  
Thou one unbroken Soul.  
We worship Thee, whose footstool is worshipped by the Gods,  
Thou Lord of the Saints,  
Physician of the World-disease,  
To Thy lotus-feet our salutation, O Great Soul!  
                 *Hindu form of salutation to a Divine Incarnation*.

I

IT is told of a certain Bodhisattva that, all his struggles done and
illumination reached, he was about to pass over into Nirvana. But as his
feet touched the threshold of supreme blessedness there rose to his ears
the sound of the sorrowful crying of humanity. Then turned that great
soul back from Nirvana and entered again into life, declaring that till
the last grain of dust in the universe had passed in before him, he
would by no means go into salvation. And this Bodhisattva is he who sits
on the throne of the Dalai-Lama in Tibet, watching the world of men with
eyes of divine pity from afar off.

Called by various names, arrayed in widely, differing garb, we come
constantly in Hinduism on the attempt, as here in the story of the
Dalai-Lama, to express the idea that in the great Heart of the Absolute
there dwells an abiding charity towards men. It would seem as if, to the
religious instinct

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

of humanity, the dream of "the pursuit of the soul by God" is a
necessity; and the Hindu, well aware of the impossibility of giving it
logical expression, veils his effort in mythology. Whence the stories or
the Avatars. For our conception of the doctrine of reincarnation is only
complete when we understand that now and again the Eternal Love is
represented as projecting itself into the sphere of manifestation,
taking shape as a man, in order to act as a lamp amidst the darkness of
delusion, a counter-magnetism to the attractions of desire.

It is absurd, says the Hindu--whose imagination can never be charged
with provincialism--to think that such an Incarnation, supposing it to
occur at all, could visit the world only once. Is respect of persons a
divine attribute? Or is the need of mankind at any time less than
complete? Can we believe, again, that the power of creative energy to
assume and throw off the shell of personality is exhausted in a single
effort? Rather must the taking upon Himself of mortal form and
limitations be to the all-pervasive "as the lifting of a flower's
fragrance by the summer breeze," a matter of play; or like the shining
of a lamp through the window wherein it is set, without effort--nothing
more.

The orthodox Hindu is thus usually in no position to deny the
supernatural character of the Babe of Bethlehem. He is only unable to
admit that the nature of Christ stands alone in the history of the
world, holding that his own country has seen even more than the
three--Rama, Krishna, and Buddha--who were His brothers. Still more
cogently does he claim sometimes that all these and possibly others of
whom he has not heard, are but one soul, one expression of Godhead
coming back at different times to lay hold on the hearts of men. And he
quotes in support of this contention the familiar

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

words of Krishna: "Whenever religion decays, and when irreligion <span
id="fr_36"></span>[\*](#fn_36.md) prevails, *then* I manifest myself. For
the protection of the good, for the destruction of the evil, for the
firm establishment of the *dharmma*, I am born again and again."

It is natural enough to the Hindu intellect that around each such
forth-shining of the Divine should grow up a new religious system or
Church. But each of these is only a special way of expressing the one
fundamental doctrine of Maya, a new mode of endearing God to man. At the
same time it is thought that every one, while recognising this perfect
sympathy of various faiths for one another, should know how to choose
one amongst them for his own, and persist in it, till by its means he
has reached a point where the formulæ of sects are meaningless to him.
"For it is good," say the people, "to be born in a church, though it is
foolish to die there."

In this sense--somewhat different from the religious partisanship of
Europe--the popular and growing belief of the Hindu masses consists of
various forms of the worship of Khrishna. It is this creed that carries
to those who need it, a religious emotionalism like that of the
Salvation Army or . of Methodism. In the hottest nights, during periods
of "revival," the streets of a city will be crowded with men bearing
lights and banners, and dancing themselves into a frenzy to such words
as:

Call on the Lord, Call on the Lord,  
Call on the Lord, little brother  
Than this name of the Lord,  
For mortal man, There is no other way.

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

Khrishna, like Rama and like Buddha, is considered to be a special
incarnation of Vishnu, God the Preserver. It is therefore pertinent to
appeal to Him for the goods of life, for consolation in sorrow, for
deliverance from fear. He is known as the Holy Child, born in humility
amidst cowherds by the Jumna; the Gentle Shepherd of the People, the
Wise Counsellor, the Blessed Lord, tender Lover and Saviour of the human
soul; and by other names not less familiar to ourselves. It is an image
of the Baby Krishna that the Indian mother adores as the Bambino,
calling it "Gopâla," her cowherd. His name fills gospels and poems, the
folk-songs of all Hindu races are full of descriptions of Him as a
cowherd wandering and sporting amongst His fellows; and childish
literature is full of stories of Him, curiously like European tales of
the Christ-child. To the ecstatic mystic, He is the Divine Spouse.

If we dip into His history we shall think it a strange medley. So many
parts were never surely thrust upon a single figure! But through it all
we note the predominant Indian characteristics,--absolute detachment
from personal ends, and a certain subtle and humorous insight into human
nature.

His main spiritual significance for India does not, perhaps--with one
exception--attach to that part of His life which is related in the
Mahabharata, but rather to what is told of Him in the Purânas--works not
unlike our apocryphal Gospels. But the one exception is important. It
consists of no less an incident than that conversation with the
chieftain Arjuna which comprises the Bhagavad Gitâ, or Song of the
Blessed One. Of this little poem--only some three or four times the
length of the Sermon on the Mount, and shorter even than the Gospel of
St. Mark--it may be said at once that amongst the

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

sacred writings of mankind there is probably no other which is at once
so great, so complete, and so short. It provides the worship of
Krishna--and incidentally all kindred systems--with that open door upon
abstract philosophy without which no cult could last in India for a
week. But it is by no means the property of the Vaishnavas exclusively.
From Kashmir to Cape Comorin it is bone of the bone and flesh of the
flesh of all forms of religious thought.

Its ideas are unmistakably Indian in colour: its *feeling* is just as
unmistakably universal. The voice that speaks on the field of
Kurukshetra is the same voice that reverberates through an English
childhood from the shores of the Sea of Galilee. We read the gracious
words, "Putting aside all doctrines, come thou to Me alone for
shelter--I will liberate thee from all sins, do not thou grieve."
"Fixing thy heart on Me, thou shalt, by My grace, cross over all
difficulties," and we drop the book, lost in a dream of One who cried to
the weary and heavy laden, "Come unto Me." We certainly now understand,
and cannot again forget, that for the Indian reader the eyes of the Lord
Krishna are most kind, His touch infinitely gentle, and His heart full
of an exceeding great compassion, even as for us are the eyes and the
hand and the heart of Him Who spoke of Himself as the Good Shepherd.

Like our own Gospels, the Gîta abounds in quaint and simple metaphors.
"As a lamp in a sheltered spot, not flickering," must be the mind. All
undertakings are surrounded with evil, "as fire with smoke." The round
of worship is "as a wheel revolving." So great is wisdom that though
thou shouldst be "even the most sinful of all sinners, thou shalt cross
safely to the conquest of all sin by the bark of wisdom alone." One of
the most beautiful, referring to those perceptions which constitute the
Universe as we know it, says, "All this

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

is threaded upon Me as gems upon a string." Nothing is mentioned that
would not be familiar to the poorest peasant, living on a fertile plain,
diversified only by a river and an occasional walled city.

And indeed it was for these, labouring men, unlettered and poor, that
the Gîtâ, with its masterly simplicity, was written. To those who had
thought salvation and the beatific vision as far beyond their attainment
as a knowledge of the classics--to these humble souls the Divine Voice
declares that, by worshipping God and doing at the same time the duty of
his station, every man may attain perfection. "Better for one is one's
own duty, however badly done, than the duty of another, though that be
easy." Again and again, as we read the Gîta, we are driven to the
conclusion that we hear an infinite mercy addressing itself to a people
who had imagined the knowledge of God to be the monopoly of priesthoods
and religious orders, and bidding them be of good courage, for the true
monk is he "who neither hates nor desires," the true worshipper any one
who "offers to Me with devotion even a leaf or a flower or a cup of
water." No wonder that the Indian people, saluting a Divine Incarnation,
call Him *the Physician of the world-disease!* Never did speech know how
to be more interior. "Those who worship Me, renouncing all actions in
Me, regarding Me as supreme, meditating on Me with entire devotion, for
them whose thought is fixed on Me, I become ere long, O son of Prithâ,
the Saviour out of the ocean of this mortal world." . . . "For I am the
abode of Brahman, the Immortal and the Immutable, the Eternal Substance,
and the unfailing Bliss." We kneel in a vast silence and darkness, and
hear words falling like water drop by drop.

Nothing is omitted from the Gîtâ that the unconsoled

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

heart requires. There are even the tender promises of daily bread, so
dear to the anxious; "They who depend on Me, putting aside all care,
whatsoever they need, I myself carry it to them," runs one verse. Of
this a beautiful story is told in the villages. The Brahmin sat copying
the text, but when the word "carry" had been written, he felt a doubt.
"My dear," he said, turning to consult his wife, "thinkest thou not it
is irreverent to say 'carry' here? Did not our Lord not mean 'send?'"
"Beyond a doubt, beloved," answered his wife, "it is as thou sayest. Let
the word be 'send.'" Then the man took his penknife and erased the word
he had just written, substituting his own emendation for it. A moment
later he rose up to go and bathe. But his wife stood before him with
troubled face. "I told thee not," she said, "that there is no food in
the house, and nought have I to cook for thee." The Brahmin smiled
gently. "Let us call upon our Lord to fulfil His own promise," he
replied quietly; "meantime, I shall go and bathe," and he passed into
the next room. Only a few minutes had he gone, when his wife was called
to the door by a beautiful youth, who stood there with a basketful of
delicious foods, ready for eating. "Who sent me this?" the woman asked
in amazement. "Your husband called me to carry it," said the lad
carelessly, putting the basket as he spoke into her hands. But to her
horror, as he lifted his arms, the housewife noted cuts and gashes above
his heart. "Alas, my poor child, who hath wounded thee?" she cried.
"Your husband, mother, before he called me, cut me with a small sharp
weapon," was the quiet answer. Dumb with astonishment, the Brahmin's
wife turned away to bestow the viands he had brought, and when she came
back to the door the youth had gone. At that instant her husband

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

re-entered the room, having returned, as she supposed from bathing. Her
wonder about the food was forgotten in indignant sympathy. "Why," she
cried, "didst thou so hurt thy messenger?" The man looked at her without
understanding. "Him whom thou sentest to me with food, as thou didst go
to bathe," she explained. "To bathe!" he stammered, "I have not yet
been!" Then the eyes of husband and wife met, and they knew both who had
come to them, and how they had wounded the heart of the Lord. And the
Brahmin returned to the sacred text, and once more erasing a word
restored it to its original form, for there can be no doubt that the
true reading is, "They who depend on Me, casting aside all care,
whatsoever they need, I myself carry it to them."

Such are some of the associations which cling to the little image of
Krishna that the children about Calcutta can buy for a few farthings. It
is made of lime, and painted blue--for just as white, to the dweller
amongst northern snows, signifies purity, so blue, the colour of sky and
ocean, to the child of the South, is the token of the Infinite. The left
hand of the image holds a flute to the lips; the right carries a thin
golden scroll, referring to the Gitâ. The feet are crossed carelessly,
like those of any strolling peasant-player, and the head is crowned.
Simple toy as it is, there is hardly a detail of the composite figure in
which a devotional system does not centre.

"O Thou that playest on the flute, standing by the water-ghats, on the
road to Brindaban!" sing the lovers of Krishna, and their hearts melt
within them while they sing, pierced as by S. Teresa's wound of seraphic
love. Of all its elements, however, there is none which has the
unequalled importance to the world of the scroll in the right hand, both
as throwing light on Indian habits of thought

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

and as an exposition of the science of religion. The questions,
therefore, On what fundamental experience does the Gîta base itself? To
what does it appeal? What does it single out in life as requiring
explanation? What is its main imperative? are of singular interest. That
place which the four Gospels hold to Christendom, the Gitâ holds to the
world of Hinduism, and in a very real sense, to understand it is to
understand India and the Indian people.

II

It is believed by Hindus that when great forces are in action, on
occasions such as those of battle and earthquake, a certain state of
etheric vibration is produced, which makes it easy for minds trembling
on the verge of supreme knowledge to vault the barricades of sense and
find illumination. Perhaps this is because a great intensity of
experience has to be found and transcended. Perhaps the conditions,
apparently simple, are really more complex than this. At any rate, the
story of the Bhagavad Gîtâ is of the coming of such beatitude to a young
soldier named Arjuna, some three thousand years ago.

Incidentally, the opening of the poem presents us with an impressive
picture of an ancient battlefield. On the great plain of Kurukshetra,
already the scene of the prayers and austerities of saints and pilgrims
for hundreds of years, two armies face each other. The leaders of both
sides occupy chariots drawn by white horses; over each waves his
personal ensign; and each carries a conch-shell, by way of trumpet, to
enable him to give signals and enforce attention to his commands. Both
armies are represented as great hosts, but indications are not wanting
that that of Duryodhana, the usurper, under the leadership

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

of Bhishma, is the larger and stronger. And this is natural, since
Duryodhana, rightly or wrongly, is still suzerain of the whole country,
while the five Pandava brothers, his cousins, are only bent on the
recovery of their rights from him. We have to call to mind that this is
an ancient battle, consisting of an immense number of small fights,
before we are able to give our thoughts calmly to the narrative, for we
are told that from all parts of the field and on both sides the white
conch-shells have been blown, giving the signal for assault, and that
already "the discharge of weapons" has begun, when Arjuna requests
Krishna, who is acting as his charioteer, to drive him into the space
between the two hosts, that he may single out those with whom he is to
enter into personal combat during the fray.

The sight of the foe, however, has an extraordinary effect on the mind
of the chieftain. Instead of looking on his enemies with an accession of
faith in the justice of his own cause and a heroic determination to
struggle to the last in its defence, he seems to realise for the first
time the consequences of the attack. Amongst the foe stand all he has
ever loved or honoured--Bhishma, the head of his house, the adored
grandsire of his childhood; Drona, to whom he owes his education, and
for whom he cherishes a passionate reverence; and cousins and relatives
innumerable besides, of whom the very worst is an old playfellow or a
gallant combatant in tourney. The path to victory lies through the
burning-ghat of the dead! The ashes of all he loves are scattered there!
As he realises this, Arjuna's great bow slips from his hand, and he
sinks to the floor of his chariot in despair. We must remember that this
is no mere failure of courage. The soldier has been tried and proved too
often to be open for a moment to such an imputation. Neither is he
represented as entertaining the slightest doubt of ultimate

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

triumph. To the fortunes of war he gives not a thought, assuming, as do
all brave men, that they must follow the right. He simply realises that
for the sake of a few years of dominion he is about, with his own hand,
to rid the earth of everything he loves. He realises, too, that this
widespread slaughter will constitute an enormous social disaster.

This feeling of Arjuna's finds religious expression. "I desire not
victory, O Krishna, neither kingdom nor pleasures. . . . It would be
better for me if the sons of Dritarashthra, arms in hand, should slay
me, unarmed and unresisting, in the battle." Surely the moral situation
is finely conceived! A prince, of the proudest lineage on earth, is
eager to be offered up as a sacrifice rather than accept empire at the
price to be paid for it. On the battlefield of life does any case need
better stating? Yet this thirst for martyrdom, which looks so like
renunciation, is really quite another thing. "Thou art grieved for those
who require no grief, yet thou speakest words of wisdom," says Krishna.
For, instead of the actual indifference to the world and to his own part
in it, of one who perceives that all before him is unreal, Arjuna is
betraying that determination to maintain things as they are which
belongs to those who hold that affection at least is a very actual good.
It is on this distinction that the whole treatise is based.

At first, indeed, the charioteer affects to meet the chieftain's
hesitation with all the contempt of knighthood for panic. "Yield not to
unmanliness, O son of Pritha!" he exclaims. "Ill doth it become thee.
Cast off this base weakness, and arise, O terror of foes." It is not
till Arjuna, with a touching acknowledgment of grief and confusion,
makes a supreme appeal for intellectual enlightenment, that Krishna, in
the character of divine teacher, enters on that immortal pronouncement
regarding the Real and

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

unreal, which ends by sending the knight back to the duty of his birth,
unshrinking, with the words: "Firm, with undoubting mind, I obey Thy
word."

As the dialogue proceeds, the dramatic element disappears. The echoes of
battle die away. We are standing alone in some chamber of the soul,
holding that colloquy between human and divine, finite and infinite,
which never ceases during life for any one of us, however little able we
may be to disentangle it from the voices of the world. At the
culminating moment of the interview, when the worshipper receives the
sudden revelation of all existing in and by the Lord Krishna, as mere
multiform expressions of His sole energy, even at this moment, and
during the rapt and broken praise which follows it, we find nothing
discordant in the *mise-en-scène*. A chariot of war has become, as only
a Hindu pen could have made it, silent as any cell of meditation. The
corner of a battlefield has grown as remote from the whirl of life as
the inmost recesses of a heart at prayer.

The main argument is, as we might expect, that as all appearances are
delusive, action is to the wise man indifferent, and should be
performed, once he is sure that he is called to it, without fear of
consequences. "Him the wise call a sage--the man whose undertakings are
all devoid alike of objects and desires, whose acts have been burnt to
ashes in the fire of wisdom." "Never did I not exist, nor thou, nor
these rulers of men; and no one of us will ever hereafter cease to
exist." Therefore, "Free from hope and from selfishness, without any
anxiety of mind, plunge thou into battle!"

The words are addressed to one who is preeminently a man of action, a
soldier--supposed, saving a due regard for his military honour, to be
swayed by the passion for justice, and the impulse to defend it. These
things being the stake, throw

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

for them, and throw boldly, says Krishna, and as results, take whatever
may chance to come. "Man has always the right to work: man has no right
to the results of work," is as much the heart and core of the Gîtâ, as
"Thou hast no right to success if thou art not also equal to failure,"
is of Stoicism. In application the two doctrines seem identical, but we
have only to read, in order to see the advantage which the idea of Maya
gives to the Indian thinker. Clear, sharp, incisive as chisel-strokes,
are the utterances of Epictetus: like thunderbolts out of a tropical
night the words of Krishna.

The Gîtâ, however, does not consist of a single chain of reasoning,
moving in definite progression from beginning to end. Rather is the same
thing said over and over again, in as many different ways as possible.
Sometimes even a form of words is repeated, as if nothing mattered save
to make the meaning clear. There is ample scope here for the digressive
energy of ages, of which the outcome is the richly-woven texture, set
here and there with those strangely-cut Oriental jewels, which must
remain amongst the greatest recorded words of religion to all time.

But readers will completely miss the sense of the Gitâ who permit
themselves to forget its first ringing words: "Yield not to unmanliness,
O son of Pritha! Ill doth it become thee. Shake off this base weakness,
and arise, O terror of foes!" The book is nowhere a call to leave the
world, but everywhere an interpretation of common life as the path to
that which lies beyond. "Better for a man is his own duty, however badly
done, than the duty of another, though that be easy." "Holding gain and
loss as one, *prepare for battle*." That the man who throws away his
weapons, and permits himself to be slain, unresisting, in the battle, is
*not* the hero of religion, but a sluggard and a coward; that the

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

true seer is he who carries his vision into action, regardless of the
consequences to himself; this is the doctrine of the Gîta, repeated
again and again. The book is really a battle-cry. Spirituality is with
it no retreat from men and things, but a burning fire of knowledge that
destroys bondage, consumes sluggishness and egoism, and penetrates
everywhere. Not the withdrawn, but the transfigured life, radiant with
power and energy, triumphant in its selflessness, is religion.

The Gîta is to-day the gospel of the Indian Revival. And never was book
so well suited to such function. For its eighteen chapters are the
expression of an overwhelming national vitality. It is as true of
peoples as of individuals, that when the age is full and rich, living is
apt to outrun knowing. It is then that large questions press for
solution. Great areas of experience require to be related to their
common centre and to each other. And so pre-eminently does the Gîta do
this, that the Mussulman and the Christian can sit indifferently with
the Hindu to gather its interpretations.

The nature of all faith, the relation of all worship to worshipped and
worshipper, the dependence of knowledge on non-attachment under all its
forms: it is with problems like these, and not with any particular
*Credo*, that the Gîta concerns itself. It is at once therefore the
smallest and most comprehensive of the scriptures of the world.

That indifference to results is the condition of efficient action is the
first point in its philosophy. But there is no doubt that the action
should be strenuous. Let every muscle be hard, every limb well-knit, let
the mind sweep the whole horizon of fact; with the reins in hand, the
fiery steeds under control, with the whole battlefield in view, and the
will of the hero lifted high to strike for justice,

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Arise!" thunders
the voice of Sri Krishna, "and be thou an apparent cause!"

It is the supreme imperative. Play thy whole part in the drama of time,
devoting every energy, concentrating the whole force. "As the ignorant
act from selfish motives, so should the wise man act, unselfishly."

Just as the child sees the sun above his head, and the earth beneath his
feet, distinguishing himself from both, while to the man of science,
sun, planet, and child are all single points in a great ocean of
force-matter, absolutely continuous from its centre to its farthest
bounds, so to us all, in the sense-plane of thought, God, soul, and
relation exist. Having reached that truth, however, which is the
Beatific Vision, any one of them will seem the whole, for all conception
of limitation will be 'blotted out. As we ourselves are seen to be but
light transformed; as thought and perception, life and motion, sun and
planet, are all but different manifestations of a something that we call
Solar Energy, so God, self, and universe, are now known to be only
distinctions made by sense in that one, Brahman, "the immortal and
immutable, the eternal substance, and the unfailing Bliss."

An account of such a vision gives us the culminating chapter of the
Gîta. Krishna suddenly bursts forth on the sight of his astonished
worshipper as the Universal Form, in Whom all that exists in one.
Characteristically Indian in expression, full of the blaze and terror of
the cosmos, this great scene can only perhaps be thoroughly appreciated
by a Western mind if it has first understood something of the craving
that it fulfils, caught some flash maybe of the radiance it describes.
Yet if the rest of the Gîtâ were destroyed, this one chapter might take
its place, for it makes all its logic actual.

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Arjuna's single
sight becomes the sacrament of a whole world's hope.

It was midnight when I reached Thaneswar. The fierce white light of a
tropical moon bathed the great common in front, where only trees and
bushes, with their coal-black shadows, could be seen, and not a single
human habitation was in sight. Behind, the dâk-bungalow lay in darkness,
and the train by which I had come had passed on long ago into the night.
One was alone on the Plain of Kurukshetra with three thousand years.

But the silence did not remain unbroken. Clear and distinct on the still
air rose the accents of the immortal dialogue. "Man has the right to
work: man has no right to the fruits of work," said, once more, the
divine Charioteer. Yet many a memorable battle has been fought, India
herself has heard a thousand dialogues, preaching the truths of the
Bhagavad Gîtâ. Why, asked my heart, does one come to this spot? For what
thing, above all others, does the world remember Kurukshetra?

And then I saw why, never to forget. Kurukshetra was the place of the
Great Vision, the field of the Divine Illumination of Arjuna.
