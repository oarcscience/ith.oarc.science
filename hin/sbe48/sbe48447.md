A scriptural text, moreover, shows that the meditation is necessary for,
and restricted to, the sacrificial performance. For the text 'A Brahman
priest who knows this saves the sacrifice, the sacrificcr, and all the
officiating priests'--which declares that all priests are saved through
the knowledge of the Brahman--has sense only on the understanding that
that knowledge is not restricted to the Ud*g*ât*ri*, and so on (i.e. not
to those priests who are engaged in carrying out the details of the
sacrifices which are the 'bases' of the meditations).--The conclusion,
therefore, is that those meditations are not restricted to the
sacrifices, subordinate members of which serve as their 'bases.'--This
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'like the bases.'
