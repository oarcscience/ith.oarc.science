<P>28. As it is desired; on account of there being no contradiction of either.</P>
<P>The time when good and evil deeds are left behind thus having been determined on the basis of the reason of the thing, the several words of the passages must be construed as it is desired, i.e. so as not to contradict either, i.e. either the declaration of scripture or the reason of the thing. Thus in the text of the Kaush&icirc;takins the later clause, 'he shakes off his good and evil deeds,' must be taken as coming before the earlier passage 'having entered on that path of the gods.'--Here the P&ucirc;rvapakshin raises a new objection.</P>
