39\. Finiteness or absence of omniscience.

'Or' here has the sense of 'and.' If the Lord is under the influence of
the ad*ri*sh*t*a, it follows that, like the individual soul, he is
subject to creation, dissolution, and so on, and that he is not
omniscient. The Pa*s*upati theory cannot therefore be accepted.--It is
true that the Sûtra, 'but in case of conflict (with Scripture) it is not
to be regarded' (Pû. Mî. Sû. I, 3, 3), has already established the
non-acceptability of all views contrary to the Veda; the present
adhikara*n*a, however, raises this question again in order specially to
declare that the Pa*s*upati theory *is* contrary to the Veda. Although
the Pâ*s*upata and the *S*aiva systems exhibit some features which are
not altogether contrary to the Veda, yet they are unacceptable because
they rest on an assumption contrary to the Veda, viz. of the difference
of the general, instrumental and material causes, and imply an erroneous
interchange of higher and lower entities.--Here terminates the
adhikara*n*a of 'Pa*s*upati.'
