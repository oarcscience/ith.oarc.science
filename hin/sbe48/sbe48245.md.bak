42\. Or, if they are of the nature of that which is knowledge and so on,
there is no contradiction to that (i.e. the Bhâgavata doctrine).

The 'or' sets aside the view previously maintained. By 'that which is
knowledge and so on' <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) we have to
understand the highest Brahman. If Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a, Pradyumna, and
Aniruddha are of the nature of the highest Brahman, then truly there can
be no objection to a body of doctrine

<span id="page_525">p. 525</span>

which sets forth this relation. The criticism that the Bhâgavatas teach
an inadmissible origination of the individual soul, is made by people
who do not understand that system. What it teaches is that the highest
Brahman, there called Vâsudeva, from kindness to those devoted to it,
voluntarily abides in a fourfold form, so as to render itself accessible
to its devotees. Thus it is said in the Paushkara-sa*m*hitâ, 'That which
enjoins that Brahma*n*as have to worship, under its proper names, the
fourfold nature of the Self; that is the authoritative doctrine.' That
this worship of that which is of a fourfold nature means worship of the
highest Brahman, called Vâsudeva, is declared in the Sâtvata-sa*m*hitâ,
'This is the supreme *s*âstra, the great Brahmopanishad, which imparts
true discrimination to Brahmawas worshipping the real Brahman under the
name of Vâsudeva.' That highest Brahman, called Vâsudeva, having for its
body the complete aggregate of the six qualities, divides itself in so
far as it is either the 'Subtle' (sûkshma), or 'division' (vyûha), or
'manifestation' (vibhava), and is attained in its fulness by the
devotees who, according to their qualifications, do worship to it by
means of works guided by knowledge. 'From the worship of the
vibhava-aspect one attains to the vyûha, and from the worship of the
vyûha one attains to the "Subtile" called Vâsudeva, i.e. the highest
Brahman'--such is their doctrine. By the 'vibhava' we have to understand
the aggregate of beings, such as Rama, K*ri*shna, &c., in whom the
highest Being becomes manifest; by the 'vyûha' the fourfold arrangement
or division of the highest Reality, as Vâsudeva, Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a,
Pradyumna, and Aniruddha; by the 'Subtle' the highest Brahman itself, in
so far as it has for its body the mere aggregate of the six
qualities--as which it is called 'Vâsudeva.' Compare on this point the
Paushkara, 'That body of doctrine through which, by means of works based
on knowledge, one fully attains to the imperishable highest Brahman,
called Vâsudeva,' and so on, Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a, Pradyumna, and
Aniruddha are thus mere bodily forms which the highest Brahman
voluntarily assumes. Scripture already declares, 'Not born he is born

<span id="page_526">p. 526</span>

in many ways,' and it is this birth--consisting in the voluntary
assumption of bodily form, due to tenderness towards its devotees--which
the Bhâgavata system teaches; hence there lies no valid objection to the
authoritativeness of that system. And as Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a.
Pradyumna, and Aniruddha are the beings ruling over the individual
souls, internal organs and organs of egoity, there can be no objection
to their being themselves denoted by those latter terms, viz. individual
soul, and so on. The case is analogous to that of Brahman being
designated, in some texts, by terms such as ether, breath, and the like.
