<P>39. But better than that is the other also on account of an inferential mark.</P>
<P>Better than to be outside the &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas is the condition of standing within an &acirc;<I>s</I>rama. The latter state may be due to misfortune; but he who can should be within an &acirc;<I>s</I>rama, which state is the more holy and beneficial one. This follows from inference only, i.e. Sm<I>ri</I>ti; for Sm<I>ri</I>ti says, 'A Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is to remain outside the &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas not even for one day.' For one who has passed beyond the stage of Brahma<I>k</I>arya, or whose wife has died, the impossibility to procure a wife constitutes the misfortune (which prevents him from belonging to an &acirc;<I>s</I>rama).--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'widowers.'</P>
