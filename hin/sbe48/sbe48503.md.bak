6\. And the ideas of Âditya and the rest on the member; on account of
this being rational.

'He who shines up there let a man meditate on him as the Udgîtha' (*Kh*.
Up. I, 3, 1).--With regard to this and similar meditations connected
with subordinate parts of sacrificial performances there arises the
doubt whether

<span id="page_720">p. 720</span>

the idea of Âditya and so on has to be superimposed on the subordinate
part of the sacrifice, such as the Udgîtha, or vice versâ (i.e. whether
Âditya should be meditated upon under the aspect of the Udgîtha, or vice
versâ).--The Pûrvapakshin holds the former view. For the general
principle is that the lower being should be viewed under the aspect of
the higher, and the Udgîtha and so on, which are parts of the sacrifices
through which certain results are effected, are superior to the
divinities who do not accomplish any result.--Of this view the Sûtra
disposes. The ideas of Âditya and so on are to be superimposed on the
'members,' i.e. the Udgîtha and so on, which are constituent members of
the sacrifices; because of the gods only superiority can be established.
For it is only through the propitiation of the gods that sacrifices are
capable of bringing about their results. The Udgîtha and the rest
therefore are to be viewed under the aspect of Âditya and so on.--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the ideas of Âditya and so on.'
