6\. And it is suggestive, according to Scripture; this the experts also
declare.

The things seen in dreams are not created by the wish of the individual
soul for this reason also, that according to Scripture dreams are
prophetic of future good or ill fortune. 'When a man engaged in some
work undertaken for some special wish sees a woman in his dream, he may
infer success from his dream vision.' Those also who understand the
science of dreams teach that dreams foreshadow good and evil fortune.
But that which depends on one's own wish can have no prophetic quality;
and as ill fortune is not desired the dreamer would create for himself
only such visions as would indicate good fortune. Hence the creation
which takes place in dreams can be the Lord's work only.--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the intermediate state.'
