8\. On the passing away of the works, with a remainder, according to
Scripture and Sm*ri*ti; as it went and not so.

The text declares that those who only perform sacrifices and useful
works ascend by the road of the fathers, and again return to the earth
when they have fully enjoyed the fruit of their works, 'having dwelt
there yâvat sa*m*pâtam, they return by the same way' (*Kh*. Up. V, 10,
5). The question here arises whether the descending soul carries a
certain remainder (anu*s*aya) of its works or not.--It does not, since
it has enjoyed the fruit of all its works. For by 'anu*s*aya' we have to
understand that part of the karman which remains over and above the part
retributively enjoyed; but when the fruit of the entire karman has been
enjoyed, there is no such remainder. And that this is so we learn from
the phrase 'yâvat sa*m*pâtam

ushitvâ,' which means 'having dwelt there as long as the karman lasts'
(sampatanty anena svargalokam iti sampâta*h*). Analogously another text
says, 'Having obtained the end of whatever deed he does on earth, he
again returns from that world to this world to action' (B*ri*. Up. V, 4,
6).--Against this primâ facie view the Sûtra declares 'with a remainder
he descends, on account of what is seen, i.e. scriptural text, and
Sm*ri*ti.' The scriptural text is the one 'Those whose conduct has been
good' (V, 10, 7), which means that among the souls that have returned,
those whose karman is good obtain a good birth as Brâhma*n*as or the
like, while those whose karman is bad are born again as low
creatures-dogs, pigs, *K*â*nd*âlas, and the like. This shows that the
souls which have descended are still connected with good or evil karman.
Sm*ri*ti also declares this: 'Men of the several castes and orders, who
always stand firm in the works prescribed for them, enjoy after death
the rewards of their works, and by virtue of a remnant (of their works)
they are born again in excellent countries, castes and families, endowed
with beauty, long life, learning in the Vedas, wealth, good conduct,
happiness and wisdom. Those who act in a contrary manner perish'
(Gautama Dha. Sû. XI, 29); 'Afterwards when a man returns to this world
he obtains, by virtue of a remainder of works, birth in a good family,
beauty of form, beauty of complexion, strength, aptitude for learning,
wisdom, wealth, and capacity for fulfilling his duties. Therefore,
rolling like a wheel (from the one to the other), in both worlds he
dwells in happiness' (Âpast. Dha. Sû. II, 1, 2, 3). The clause 'as long
as his works last' (yâvat-sa*m*pâtam) refers to that part of his works
only which was performed with a view to reward (as promised for those
works by the Veda); and the same holds true with regard to the passage
'whatever work man does here on earth' (B*ri*. Up. V, 4, 6). Nor is it
possible that works, the fruit of which has not yet been enjoyed, and
those the result of which has not been wiped out by expiatory
ceremonies, should be destroyed by the enjoyment of the fruits of other
works. Hence those who have gone to that world return with

a remnant of their works, 'as they went and not so'--i.e. in the same
way as they ascended and also in a different way. For the ascent takes
place by the following stages--smoke, night, the dark half of the moon,
the six months of the sun's southern progress, the world of the fathers,
ether, moon. The descent, on the other hand, goes from the place of the
moon, through ether, wind, smoke, mist, cloud. The two journeys are
alike in so far as they pass through ether, but different in so far as
the descent touches wind, and so on, and does not touch the world of the
fathers, and other stages of the ascent.
