5\. But the hands and so on also; (since they assist the soul) abiding
(in the body). Hence (it is) not so.

The organs are not seven only, but eleven, since the hands and the rest
also contribute towards the experience and fruition of that which abides
in the body, i.e. the soul, and have their separate offices, such as
seizing, and so on. Hence it is not so, i.e. it must not be thought that
the hands and the rest are not organs. Buddhi, ahankâra and *k*itta, on
the other hand, are(not independent organs but) mere designations of the
manas, according as the latter is engaged in the functions of deciding
(adhyavasâya), or misconception (abhimâna, or thinking (*k*intâ). The
organs therefore are eleven. From this it follows that in the passage
'Ten are these prâ*n*as in man, and Âtman is the eleventh'(B*ri*. Up.
II, 4, ii), the word Âtman denotes the manas. The number *eleven* is
confirmed by scriptural and Sm*ri*ti passages, cp. 'the ten organs and
the one' (Bha. Gî. XIII, 5); 'ten are the vaikârika beings, the manas is
the eleventh,' and others. Where more organs

are mentioned, the different functions of the manas are meant; and
references to smaller numbers are connected with special effects of the
organs, such as accompanying the soul, and the like.--Here terminates
the adhikara*n*a of 'the going of the seven.'
