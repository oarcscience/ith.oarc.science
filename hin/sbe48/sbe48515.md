The declaration made in the text 'whatever he does with knowledge that
is more vigorous,' viz. that the knowledge of the Udgîtha has for its
result non-obstruction of the result of the sacrifice, implies that the
result of works actually performed *may* be obstructed. We thus arrive
at the conclusion that the text of the Sâ*t*yâyanins,' his friends enter
upon his good works,' refers to those good works of the man possessing
knowledge the results of which were somehow obstructed (and hence did
not act themselves out during his lifetime, so that on his death they
may be transferred to others).--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the
Agnihotra and the rest.'
