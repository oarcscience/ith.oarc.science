9\. On the passing away of the effected (world of Brahma), together with
its ruler, (the souls go) to what is higher than that; on account of
scriptural declaration.

On the passing away of the effected world of Brahma, together with its
ruler Hira*n*yagarbha, who then recognises his qualification for higher
knowledge, the soul also which had gone to Hira*n*yagarbha attains to
true knowledge and thus reaches Brahman, which is higher than that,

i.e. higher than the effected world of Brahmâ. This is known from the
texts declaring that he who proceeds on the path of light reaches
immortality and does not return; and is further confirmed by the text,
'They all, reaching the highest immortality, become free in the world of
Brahman (Brahmâ) at the time of the great end ' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 6).
