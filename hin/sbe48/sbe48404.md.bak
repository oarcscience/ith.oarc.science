20\. On account of connexion, thus elsewhere also.

In the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka (V, 5) it is said that Brahman is to be
meditated upon as abiding within the orb of the sun and within the right
eye; and then the text mentions two secret names of Brahman--*aham* and
*ahar*. Here the Pûrvapakshin holds that both these names are to be
comprehended in each of the two meditations 'On account of connexion,'
i.e. on account of the object of meditation, i.e. Brahman being one
only, although connected with different abodes, it is 'thus elsewhere
also,' i.e. the same conclusion which had been arrived at in the case of
the *S*â*nd*ilya-vidyâs, has to be accepted with regard to Brahman
abiding in the sun and in the eye. The meditation is one only, and hence
the two secret names apply to Brahman in both its abodes.--This view the
next Sûtra negatives.
