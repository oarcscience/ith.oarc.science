36\. (There would be) absence of definite rule, as in the case of
consciousness.

The Sûtra points out a difficulty which arises on the view of the Self
not being an agent. Sûtra 32 has declared that if the Self were
all-pervading it would follow that there would be no definite
determination with regard to consciousness. Similarly, if the Self were
not an agent but all activity belonged to Prak*ri*ti it would follow
that as Prak*ri*ti is a common possession of all souls, all actions
would result in enjoyment (experience) on the part of all souls, or else
on the part of none; for as each Self is held to be omnipresent, they
are all of them in equal proximity to all parts of the Pradhâna. For the
same reason it could not be maintained that the distribution of results
between the different souls depends on the different internal organs
which are joined to the souls; for if the souls are omnipresent, no soul
will be exclusively connected with any particular internal organ.
