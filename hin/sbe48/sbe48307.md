9\. But like the eye and the rest, on account of being taught with them,
and for other reasons.

Breath is not an element, but like sight and the rest, a special
instrument of the soul. This appears from the fact that the texts
mention it together with the recognised organs of the soul, the eye, and
so on; so e.g. in the colloquy of the prâ*n*as. And such common mention
is suitable in the case of such things only as belong to one class.--The
'and for other reasons' of the Sûtra refers to the circumstance of the
principal breath being specially mentioned among the organs comprised
under the term 'prâ*n*a'; cp. 'that principal breath' (*Kh*. Up. I, 2,
7); 'that central breath' (B*ri*. Up. I, 5, 21).--But if the chief
breath is, like the eye and the other organs, an instrument of the soul,
there must be some special form of activity through which it assists the
soul, as the eye e.g. assists the soul by seeing. But no such activity
is perceived, and the breath cannot therefore be put in the same
category as the organs of sensation and action!--To this objection the
next Sûtra replies.
