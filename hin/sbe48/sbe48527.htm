<P>11. And to that very (subtle body) (there belongs) the warmth, this only being reasonable.</P>
<P>It is observed that when a man is about to die there is some warmth left in some part or parts of the gross body. Now this warmth cannot really belong to the gross body, for it is not observed in other parts of that body (while yet there is no reason why it should be limited to some part); but it may reasonably be attributed to the subtle body which may abide in some part of the gross body (and into which the warmth of the entire gross body has withdrawn itself). We therefore conclude that this partial perception of warmth is due to the departing subtle body. This confirms the view laid down in S&ucirc;tra 7.--The next S&ucirc;tra disposes of a further doubt raised as to the departure of the soul of him who knows.</P>
