<P>10. (It is) non-comprehensive.</P>
<P>The scriptural declaration does not refer to all meditations, but only to the meditation on the Udg&icirc;tha. In the clause 'what he does with knowledge,' the 'what' is in itself indefinite, and therefore must be defined as connecting itself with the Udg&icirc;tha mentioned in the previous clause, 'Let him meditate on the Udg&icirc;tha.' The sentence cannot be construed to mean 'whatever he does is to be done with knowledge,' but means 'that which he does with knowledge becomes more vigorous,' and <I>that which is</I> done with knowledge that is the Udg&icirc;tha. The next S&ucirc;tra refutes the argument set forth in S&ucirc;tra 5.</P>
