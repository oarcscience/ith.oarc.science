29\. *G*aimini thinks that there is no objection to (the word 'Agni')
directly (denoting the highest Self).

So far it has been maintained that the word 'Agni,' which stands in
co-ordination with the term 'Vai*s*vânara,' denotes the highest Self in
so far as qualified by the intestinal fire constituting its body; and
that hence the text under discussion enjoins meditation on the highest
Self. *G*aimini, on the other hand, is of opinion that there is no
reasonable objection to the term 'Agni,' no less than the term:
'Vai*s*vânara,' being taken *directly* to denote the highest Self. That
is to say--in the same way as the term 'Vai*s*vânara,' although a common
term, yet when qualified by attributes especially belonging to the
highest Self is known to denote the latter only as possessing the
quality of ruling all men; so the word 'Agni' also when appearing in
connexion with special attributes belonging to the highest Self denotes
that Self only. For any quality on the ground of which 'Agni' may be
etymologically explained to denote ordinary fire--as when e.g. we
explain 'agni' as he who 'agre nayati'--may also, in its highest
non-conditioned degree, be ascribed to the supreme Self. Another
difficulty

remains. The passage (V, 18, 1) 'yas tv etam eva*m* prâde*s*amâtram
abhivimânam,' &c. declares that the non-limited highest Brahman is
limited by the measure of the prade*s*as, i.e. of the different
spaces-heaven, ether, earth, &c.--which had previously been said to
constitute the limbs of Vai*s*vânara. How is this possible?
