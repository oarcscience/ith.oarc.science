<P>19. And on account of desire, there is no regard to what is inferred (i.e. matter).</P>
<P>In order that the individual soul which is enthralled by Nescience may operate as the cause of the world, it must needs be connected with non-sentient matter, called by such names as pradh&acirc;na, or &acirc;num&acirc;nika (that which is inferred). For such is the condition for the creative energy of Brahm&acirc; and similar beings. Our text, on the other hand, teaches that the creation of the aggregate of sentient and non-sentient things results from the mere wish of a being free from all connexion with non-sentient matter, 'He desired, may I be many, may I grow forth;' 'He sent forth all, whatever there is' (Taitt. Up. II, 6). We thus understand that that Self of bliss which sends forth the world does not require connexion with non-sentient matter called &acirc;num&acirc;nika, and hence conclude that it is other than the individual soul.--A further reason is stated in the next S&ucirc;tra.</P>
