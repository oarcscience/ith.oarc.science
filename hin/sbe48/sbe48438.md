54\. Or there is no contradiction as in the case of mantras and the
rest.

The 'or' here has the sense of 'and.' The 'and the rest' comprises
generic characteristics, qualities, number, similarity, order of
succession, substances, and actions. As there is nothing contrary to
reason in mantras and the rest, although mentioned in the text of one
*s*âkhâ only, finding, on the basis of such means of proof as direct
statement, and so on, their application in all *s*âkhâs, since the
sacrifice to which they belong is one and the same in all *s*âkhâs; so
there is likewise no contradiction in the meditations under discussion
being undertaken by members of all *s*âkhâs.--Here terminates the
adhikara*n*a of 'what is connected with constituent elements of the
sacrifice.'

sacrifice; for thus Scripture shows](sbe48439.md)
