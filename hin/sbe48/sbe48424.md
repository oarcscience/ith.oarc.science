true nature, has approached, i.e. attained to Brahman; then just on that

\[paragraph continues\] He is the highest Person. He moves about there
laughing, playing,' &c. This point will be proved in greater detail in
the fourth adhyâya. Meanwhile the conclusion is that such qualities as
satyakâmatva have to be included in the meditation of him also who is
desirous of release; for the possession of those qualities forms part of
the experience of the released soul itself.--Here terminates the
adhikara*n*a of 'wishes and the rest'
