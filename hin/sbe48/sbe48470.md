23\. Should it be said that (the stories told in the Upanishads) are for
the purpose of the Pâriplava; not so, since (certain stories) are
specified.

We meet in the Vedânta-texts with certain stories such as 'Pratardana
the son of Divodâsa came to the beloved abode of Indra,' &c., and
similar ones. The question here arises whether the stories are merely
meant to be recited at the A*s*vamedha sacrifice or to convey knowledge
of a special kind.--The Pûrvapakshin maintains that as the text' they
tell the stories' declares the special connexion of those stories with
the so-called pâriplava performance,

they cannot be assumed to be mainly concerned with knowledge.--This view
the Sûtra negatives, on the ground that not all stories of that kind are
specially connected with the pâriplava. The texts rather single out
special stories only as suitable for that performance; on the general
injunction quoted above there follows an injunction defining *which*
stories are to be told, 'King Manu, the son of Vivasvat,' &c. The
stories told in the Vedânta-texts do not therefore form parts of the
pâriplava performance, but are connected with injunctions of
meditations.
