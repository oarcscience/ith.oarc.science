3\. On account of (such) conduct being seen.

It is seen, viz in Scripture, that those who knew Brahman busied
themselves chiefly with sacrifices.--A*s*vapati Kaikeya had a deep
knowledge of the Self; but when three *Ri*shis had come to him to
receive instruction regarding the Self, he told them 'I am about, to
perform a sacrifice, Sirs' (*Kh*. Up. V, II). Similarly we learn from
Sm*ri*ti that *G*anaka and other princes deeply versed in the knowledge
of Brahman applied themselves to sacrificial works, 'By works only
*G*anaka and others attained to perfection'; 'He also, well founded in
knowledge, offered many sacrifices.' And this fact--that those who know
Brahman apply themselves to works chiefly--shows that knowledge (or
meditation) has no independent value, but serves to set forth the true
nature of the active Self, and thus is subordinate to work.--An even
more direct proof is set forth in the next Sûtra.
