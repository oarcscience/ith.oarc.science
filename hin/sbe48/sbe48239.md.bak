36\. (The system) of the Lord (must be disregarded), on account of
inappropriateness.

So far it has been shown that the doctrines of Kapila, Ka*n*âda, Sugata,
and the Arhat must be disregarded by men desirous of final beatitude;
for those doctrines are all alike untenable and foreign to the Veda. The
Sûtras now declare that, for the same reasons, the doctrine of
Pa*s*upati also has to be disregarded. The adherents of this view belong
to four different classes--Kâpâlas, Kâlâmukhas, Pâ*s*upatas, and
*S*aivas. All of them hold fanciful theories of Reality which are in
conflict with the Veda, and invent various means for attaining happiness
in this life and the next. They maintain the general material cause and
the operative cause to be distinct, and the latter cause to be
constituted by Pa*s*upati. They further hold the wearing of the six
so-called 'mudrâ' badges and the like to be means to accomplish the
highest end of man.

Thus the Kâpâlas say, 'He who knows the true nature of the six mudrâs,
who understands the highest mudrâ, meditating on himself as in the
position called bhagâsana, reaches Nirvâ*n*a. The necklace, the golden
ornament, the

earring, the head-jewel, ashes, and the sacred thread are called the six
mudrâs. He whose body is marked with these is not born here
again.'--Similarly the Kâlâmukhas teach that the means for obtaining all
desired results in this world as well as the next are constituted by
certain practices--such as using a skull as a drinking vessel, smearing
oneself with the ashes of a dead body, eating the flesh of such a body,
carrying a heavy stick, setting up a liquor-jar and using it as a
platform for making offerings to the gods, and the like. 'A bracelet
made of Rudrâksha-seeds on the arm, matted hair on the head, a skull,
smearing oneself with ashes, &c.'--all this is well known from the
sacred writings of the Saivas. They also hold that by some special
ceremonial performance men of different castes may become Brâhma*n*as
and reach the highest â*s*rama: 'by merely entering on the initiatory
ceremony (dîkshâ) a man becomes a Brâhma*n*a at once; by undertaking the
kâpâla rite a man becomes at once an ascetic.'

With regard to these views the Sûtra says 'of pati, on account of
inappropriateness.' A 'not' has here to be supplied from Sûtra 32. The
system of Pa*s*upati has to be disregarded because it is inappropriate,
i.e. because the different views and practices referred to are opposed
to one another and in conflict with the Veda. The different practices
enumerated above, the wearing of the six mudrâs and so on, are opposed
to each other; and moreover the theoretical assumptions of those people,
their forms of devotion and their practices, are in conflict with the
Veda. For the Veda declares that Nârâya*n*a who is the highest Brahman
is alone the operative and the substantial cause of the world,
'Nârâya*n*a is the highest Brahman, Nârâya*n*a is the highest Reality,
Nârâya*n*a is the highest light, Nârâya*n*a is the highest Self'; 'That
thought, may I be many, may I grow forth' (*Kh*. Up. VI, 2, 3); 'He
desired, may I be many, may I grow forth' (Taitt. Up. II, 6, 1), and so
on. In the same way the texts declare meditation on the Supreme Person,
who is the highest Brahman, to be the only meditation which effects
final release; cp. 'I know that great Person of sunlike lustre beyond
the

<span id="page_522">p. 522</span>

darkness. A man who knows him passes over death; there is no other path
to go' (*S*vet. Up. III, 8). And in the same way all texts agree in
declaring that the works subserving the knowledge of Brahman are only
those sacrificial and other works which the Veda enjoins on men in the
different castes and stages of life: 'Him Brâhma*n*as seek to know by
the study of the Veda, by sacrifice, by gifts, by penance, by fasting.
Wishing for that world only, mendicants wander forth from their homes'
(B*ri*. Up. XI, 4, 22). In some texts enjoining devout meditation, and
so on, we indeed meet with terms such as Pra*g*âpati, *S*iva, Indra,
Âkâ*s*a, Prâ*n*a, &c., but that these all refer to the supreme Reality
established by the texts concerning Nârâya*n*a--the aim of which texts
it is to set forth the highest Reality in its purity--, we have already
proved under I, 1, 30. In the same way we have proved under Sû. I, 1, 2
that in texts treating of the creation of the world, such as 'Being only
this was in the beginning,' and the like, the words *Being*, *Brahman*,
and so on, denote nobody else but Nârâya*n*a, who is set forth as the
universal creator in the account of creation given in the text, 'Alone
indeed there was Nârâya*n*a, not Brahmâ, not I*s*âna--he being alone did
not rejoice' (Mahopanishad I).--As the Pa*s*upati theory thus teaches
principles, meditations and acts conflicting with the Veda, it must be
disregarded.
