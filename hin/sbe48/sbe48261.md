The 'but' has an asseverative sense. The direct origination from Brahman
of all effects--which in passages such as the one quoted by the
Pûrvapakshin is stated in a form the reverse of the (true) order of
origination according to which the Unevolved, the Mahat, the
aha<u>n</u>kâra, Ether, and so on, succeed each other--is possible only
on the supposition of the origination of each effect being really from
Brahman itself in the form of a special causal substance. To understand
the causality of Brahman as a merely mediate one would be to contradict
all those statements of immediate origination. Texts such as the one
quoted thus confirm the conclusion that everything originates from
Brahman directly.
