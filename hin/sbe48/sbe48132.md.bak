34\. And on account of (*G*âna*s*ruti ) kshattriya-hood being
understood.

The first section of the vidyâ tells us that *G*âna*s*ruti bestowed much
wealth and food; later on he is represented as sending his door-keeper
on an errand; and in the end, as bestowing on Raikva many
villages--which shows him to be a territorial lord. All these
circumstances suggest *G*âna*s*ruti's being a Kshattriya, and hence not
a member of the lowest caste.--The above Sûtra having declared that the
kshattriya-hood of *G*âna*s*ruti is indicated in the introductory
legend, the next Sûtra shows that the same circumstance is indicated in
the concluding legend.
