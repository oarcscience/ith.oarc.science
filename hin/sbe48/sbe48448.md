# FOURTH PÂDA.

1\. The benefit to man results from thence, on account of scriptural
statement; thus Bâdarâya*n*a thinks.

We have concluded the investigation into the oneness or diverseness of
meditations--the result of which is to indicate in which cases the
special points mentioned in several meditations have to be combined, and
in which not. A further point now to be investigated is whether that
advantage to the meditating devotee, which is held to accrue to him from
the meditation, results from the meditation directly, or from works of
which the meditations are subordinate members.--The Reverend
Bâdarâya*n*a holds the former view. The benefit to man results from
thence, i.e. from the meditation, because Scripture declares this to be
so. 'He who knows Brahman reaches the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1, 1); 'I
know that great Person of sun-like lustre beyond the darkness. A man who
knows him truly passes over death; there is no other path to go'
(*S*vet. Up. III, 8); 'As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea,
losing their name and their form, thus a man who possesses knowledge,
freed from name and form, goes to the divine Person who is greater than
the great' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 8).--Against this view the Pûrvapakshin
raises an objection.
