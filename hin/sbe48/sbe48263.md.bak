17\. But that which abides in the things movable and immovable, i.e. the
terms denoting those things, are non-secondary (i.e. of primary
denotative power, viz. with regard to Brahman); since (their denotative
power) is effected by the being of that (i.e. Brahman).

The 'but' sets aside the objection raised. (The primâ facie view here is
as follows.) As Brahman, which has all things for its modes, is not the
object of Perception and the other means of knowledge which give rise to
the apprehension of the things only which are Brahman's modes, and as
hence, previously to the study of the Vedânta-texts, the idea of that to
which the modes belong (i.e. of Brahman) does not arise, and as the
knowledge of all words finally denoting Brahman depends on the existence
of the idea of that to which the modes belong (i. e. Brahman); all the

individual words are used in worldly language only separately to denote
special things. In other words, as the terms 'fire' and so on have
denotative power with regard to particular things only, their denotative
power with regard to Brahman is secondary, indirect only.--Of this view
the Sûtra disposes by saying 'that which abides in the moving and the
non-moving,' &c. The meaning is--the terms which abide in, i.e. are
connected with, the different moving and non-moving things, and hence
denote those things, possess with regard to Brahman a denotative power
which is not 'bhâkta,' i.e. secondary or figurative, but primary and
direct. 'Why so?' Because the denotative power of all words is dependent
on the being of Brahman. For this we know from the scriptural passage
which tells how names and forms were evolved by Brahman.--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'fire.'
