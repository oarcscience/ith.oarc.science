5\. The view of Brahman, on account of superiority.

The view of Brahman may appropriately be superimposed on mind and the
like; but not the view of mind, and so on, on Brahman. For Brahman is
something superior to mind, and so on; while the latter are inferior to
Brahman. To view a superior person, a prince e.g., as a servant would be
lowering; while, on the other hand, to view a servant as a prince is
exalting.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'symbols.'
