7\. Sitting; on account of possibility.

It has been shown that that special form of cognitional activity which
the Vedânta-texts set forth as the means of accomplishing final Release
and which is called meditation (dhyâna; upâsana) has to be frequently
repeated, and is of the nature of continued representation. A question
now arises as to the way in which it has to be carried on.--There being
no special restrictive rule, the Pûrvapakshin holds that the Devotee may
carry it on either sitting or lying down or standing or walking.--This
view the Sûtra sets aside. Meditation is to be carried on by the Devotee
in a sitting posture, since in that posture only the needful
concentration of mind can be reached. Standing and walking demand
effort, and lying down is conducive to sleep. The proper posture is
sitting on some support, so that no effort may be required for holding
the body up.
