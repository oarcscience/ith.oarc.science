Since the pra*n*ava, which is a part of the udgîtha, is introduced as
the subject of meditation in the first prapâ*th*aka of the *Kh*ândogya,
and extends over the later vidyâs also, it is appropriate to assume that
also in the clause 'the gods took the udgîtha'--which stands in the
middle--the term udgîtha denotes the pra*n*ava. Expressions such as 'the
cloth is burned' show that frequently the whole denotes

the part.--The conclusion from all this is that in the *Kh*ândogya the
object of meditation is constituted by the pra*n*ava--there termed
udgîtha--viewed under the form of prâ*n*a; while in the Vâ*g*asaneyaka
the term udgîtha denotes the whole udgîtha, and the object of meditation
is he who produces the udgîtha, i.e. the udgât*ri*, viewed under the
form of prâ*n*a. And this proves that the two vidyâs are separate.--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'difference.'
