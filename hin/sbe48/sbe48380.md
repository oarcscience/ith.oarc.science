in this world, is pervaded inside and outside by Nârâya*n*a' (Mahânâr.
Up.); 'The eternal, pervading, omnipresent, which the Wise consider as
the source of all beings' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 6). The 'and the rest' in the
Sâtra comprises passages such as 'Brahman indeed is all this,' 'The Self
indeed is all this,' and the like. The conclusion is that the highest
Brahman is absolutely supreme.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the
Highest.'
