11\. On account of the uniformity of view.

'In the beginning the Self was all this; there was nothing else
whatsoever thinking. He thought, shall I send forth worlds? He sent
forth these worlds' (Ait. Âr. II, 4, 1, 1); 'From that Self sprang
ether, from ether air, from air fire, from fire water, from water earth'
(Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'From this great Being were breathed forth the
*Ri*g-veda,' &c.--These and similar texts referring to the creation have
all the same purport: they all teach us that the Supreme Lord is the
cause of the world. We therefore conclude that in the *Kh*. passage also
the Sat, which is said to be the cause of the world, is the Supreme
Lord.
