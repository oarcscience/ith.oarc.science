For the text 'A Brahman priest who knows this saves the sacrifice, the sacrificcr, and all the officiating priests'--which declares that all priests are saved through the knowledge of the Brahman--has sense only on the understanding that that knowledge is not restricted to the Ud<I>g</I>&acirc;t<I>ri</I>, and so on (i.e. not to those priests who are engaged in carrying out the details of the sacrifices which are the 'bases' of the meditations).--The conclusion, therefore, is that those meditations are not restricted to the sacrifices, subordinate members of which serve as their 'bases.'--This terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'like the bases.'</P>
