5\. The non-abandonment of the promissory statement (results) from
non-difference.

It is not appropriate to assume, from deference to the *Kh*ândogya-text,
a secondary meaning for those other texts also which declare Ether to
have originated. For the *Kh*ândogyaitself virtually admits the
origination of Ether; in so far, namely, as the clause 'that by which
the non-heard is heard,' &c., declares that through the knowledge of
Brahman everything is known. This declaration is not abandoned, i.e. is
adhered to, only if the Ether also is an effect of Brahman and thus
non-different from it.
