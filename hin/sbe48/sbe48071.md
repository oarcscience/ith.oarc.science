5\. On account of the difference of words.

The clause 'That is the Self of me, within the heart' designates the
embodied soul by means of a genitive form, while the object of
meditation is exhibited in the nominative case. Similarly, a text of the
Vâ*g*asaneyins, which treats of the same topic, applies different terms
to the embodied and the highest Self, 'Like a rice grain, or a barley
grain, or a canary seed, or the kernel of a canary seed, thus that
golden Person is within the Self' (*S*at. Br. X, 6, 3, 2). Here the
locative form, 'within the Self,' denotes the embodied Self, and the
nominative, 'that golden Person,' the object to be meditated on.--All
this proves the highest Self to be the object of meditation.
