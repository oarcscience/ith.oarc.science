6\. In the sole nature of intelligence; as that is its Self. Thus
Au*d*ulomi thinks.

Intelligence (consciousness; *k*aitanya) alone is the true nature of the
soul, and hence it is in that character only that the released soul
manifests itself; this is the view of the teacher Au*d*ulomi. That
intelligence only constitutes the true being of the soul, we learn from
the express statement 'As a lump of salt has neither inside nor outside,
but is altogether a mass of taste; so this Self has neither inside nor
outside, but is altogether a mass of knowledge' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 5, 13).
When, therefore, the text attributes to the soul freedom from evil and
the rest, it does not mean to predicate of it further positive
qualities, but only

to exclude all the qualities depending on avidyâ--change, pleasure,
pain, and so on--For these reasons Au*d*ulomi holds that the released
soul manifests itself as mere intelligence.--Next the teacher
Bâdarâya*n*a determines the question by propounding his own view.

[Next: 7. Thus also, on account of existence of the former qualities as
proved by suggestion, Bâdarayana holds absence of
contradiction](sbe48558.md)
