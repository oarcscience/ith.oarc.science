15\. They, with the exception of the best, are organs, on account of
being so designated.

Are all principles called prâ*n*as to be considered as 'organs'
(indriyâ*n*i), or is the 'best,' i.e. the chief prâ*n*a, to be
excepted?--All of them, without exception, are organs; for they all are
called prâ*n*as equally, and they all are instruments of the soul.--Not

prawas other than the best are designated as organs. Texts such as 'the
organs are ten and one' (Bha. Gî. XIII, 5) apply the term 'organ' only
to the senses of sight and the rest, and the internal organ.
