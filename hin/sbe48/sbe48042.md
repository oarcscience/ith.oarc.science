9\. And on account of the contradiction of the initial statement.

The Pradhâna's being the cause of the world would imply a contradiction
of the initial statement, viz. that through the knowledge of one thing
all things are to be known. Now, on the principle of the non-difference
of cause and effect, this initial statement can only be fulfilled in
that way that

through the knowledge of the 'Sat', which is the cause, there is known
the entire world, whether sentient or non-sentient, which constitutes
the effect. But if the Pradhâna were the cause, the aggregate of
sentient beings could not be known through it--for sentient beings are
not the effect of a non-sentient principle, and there would thus arise a
contradiction.--The next Sûtra supplies a further reason.
