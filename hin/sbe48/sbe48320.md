to be followed by the prâ*n*as, 'when he thus passes out, the chief
prâ*n*a follows after him,' &c. (B*ri*. Up. V, 4, 2). Compare also
Sm*ri*ti: 'It draws to itself the organs of sense, with the mind for the

another, he takes with him those organs and then moves on, as the wind
takes the odours from their abodes (the flowers)' (Bha. Gî. XV, 8). But
the prâ*n*as cannot move without a substrate, and hence we must admit
that the rudiments of the elements--which are their substrate--are also
moving.
