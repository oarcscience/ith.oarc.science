6\. And on account of Sm*ri*ti.

'I dwell within the hearts of all, from me come memory and knowledge, as
well as their loss'; 'He who free from delusion knows me to be the
highest Person'; 'The Lord, O Ar*g*una, is seated in the heart of all
Beings, driving round by his mysterious power all beings as if mounted
on a machine; to him fly for refuge' (Bha. Gi. XV, 15, 19; XVIII, 61).
These Sm*ri*ti-texts show the embodied soul to be the meditating
subject, and the highest Self the object of meditation.
