<P>20. If it be said, owing to the scriptural declaration of smallness; that has been explained.</P>
<P>The text describes the ether within the heart as being of small compass, and this agrees indeed with the individual soul which elsewhere is compared to the point of an awl, but not with Brahman, which is greater than everything.--The reply to this objection has virtually been given before, viz. under I, 2, 7, where it is said that Brahman may be viewed as of small size, for the purpose of devout meditation.</P>
<P>It thus remains a settled conclusion that the small ether is none other but the highest Person who is untouched by even a shadow of imperfection, and is an ocean of infinite, supremely exalted, qualities--knowledge, strength, lordly power, &amp;c. The being, on the other hand, which in the teaching of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is described as first having a body due to karman--as we see from passages such as 'they strike it as it were, they cut it as it were'--and as afterwards approaching the highest light, and then manifesting its essential qualities, viz. freedom from sin, &amp;c., is the individual soul; not the small ether (or Brahman).</P>
<P>The next S&ucirc;tra supplies a further reason for this conclusion.</P>
