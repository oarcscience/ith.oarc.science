# THIRD ADHYÂYA.

## FIRST PÂDA.

1\. In obtaining another of that, it goes enveloped, (as appears) from
question and explanation.

That the Vedânta-texts establish as the proper object of meditation, on
the part of all men desirous of Release, the highest Brahman, which is
the only cause of the entire world, which is not touched by even a
shadow of imperfection, which is an ocean, as it were, of supremely
exalted qualities, and which totally differs in nature from all other
beings--this is the point proved in the two previous adhyâyas; there
being given at the same time arguments to disprove the objections raised
against the Vedânta doctrine on the basis of Sm*ri*ti and reasoning, to
refute the views held by other schools, to show that the different
Vedânta-texts do not contradict each other, and to prove that the Self
is the object of activities (enjoined in injunctions of meditation, and
so on). In short, those two adhyâyas have set forth the essential nature
of Brahman. The subsequent part of the work now makes it its task to
enquire into the mode of attaining to Brahman, together with the means
of attainment. The third adhyâya is concerned with an enquiry into
meditation--which is the means of attaining to Brahman; and as the
motive for entering on such meditation is supplied by the absence of all
desire for what is other than the thing to be obtained, and by the
desire for that thing, the points first to be enquired into are the
imperfections of the individual soul--moving about in the different
worlds, whether waking or dreaming or merged in dreamless sleep, or in
the state of swoon; and those blessed characteristics by which Brahman
is raised above all these imperfections. These are the topics of the
first and second pâdas of the adhyâya.

The first question to be considered is whether the soul,

<span id="page_585">p. 585</span>

when moving from one body into another, is enveloped by those subtle
rudiments of the elements from which the new body is produced, or not.
The Pûrvapakshin maintains the latter alternative; for, he says,
wherever the soul goes it can easily provide itself there with those
rudiments. Other reasons supporting this primâ facie view will be
mentioned and refuted further on.--The Sûtra states the view finally
accepted, 'In obtaining another "of that" it goes enveloped.' The 'of
that' refers back to the form, i.e. body, mentioned in II, 4, 17. The
soul when moving towards another embodiment goes enveloped by the
rudiments of the elements. This is known 'from question and
explanation,' i.e. answer. Question and answer are recorded in the
'Knowledge of the five fires' (*Kh*. Up. V, 3-10), where Pravâha*n*a,
after having addressed to *S*vetaketu several other questions, finally
asks 'Do you know why in the fifth libation water is called man?' In
answer to this last question the text then explains how the Devas, i.e.
the prâ*n*as attached to the soul, offer into the heavenly world,
imagined as a sacrificial fire, the oblation called *s*raddhâ; how this
*s*raddhâ changes itself into a body con sisting of am*ri*ta, which body
is called moon; how the same prâ*n*as offer this body of am*ri*ta in
Par*g*anya, imagined as a fire, whereupon the body so offered becomes
rain; how the same prâ*n*as throw that rain on to the earth, also
imagined as a sacrificial fire, whereupon it becomes food; how this food
is then offered into man, also compared to fire, where it becomes seed;
and how, finally, this seed is offered into woman, also compared to a
fire, and there becomes an embryo. The text then goes on, 'Thus in the
fifth oblation water becomes purushava*k*as,' i.e. to be designated by
the term *man*. And this means that the water which, in a subtle form,
was throughout present in the previous oblations also, now, in that
fifth oblation, assumes the form of a man.--From this question and
answer it thus appears that the soul moves towards a new embodiment,
together with the subtle rudiments from which the new body springs.--But
the words, 'water becomes purushava*k*as,' only intimate that water
assumes

<span id="page_586">p. 586</span>

the form of a man, whence we conclude that water only invests the soul
during its wanderings; how then can it be held that the soul moves
invested by the rudiments of all elements?--To this question the next
Sûtra replies.
