<P>25. Should it be said (that this is not so) on account of specialisation of abode; we say no, on account of the acknowledgment (of a place of the Self), viz. in the heart.</P>
<P>There is a difference. The drop of ointment can produce its effect as at any rate it is in contact with a definite part of the body. But we know of no such part in the case of the soul!--Not so, we reply. Scripture informs us that the Self abides in a definite part of the body, viz. the heart. 'For that Self is in the heart, there are a hundred and one veins.' And in reply to the question 'What is that Self?' the text has 'He who is within the heart, surrounded by the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as, the Person of light, consisting of knowledge' (B<I>ri.</I> Up. IV, 3, 7).--The parallel case of the sandal-ointment is referred to in order to point out that the Self abides in some particular part of the body; while the ointment is not bound to any special place.--In the next S&ucirc;tra the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra proceeds to state how, according to his own view, the Self, although abiding in one spot only, gives rise to effects extending over the whole body.</P>
