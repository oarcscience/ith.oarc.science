46\. And Sm*ri*ti texts declare this.

That the world and Brahman stand to each other in the relation of part
and whole, the former being like the light and the latter like the
luminous body, or the former being like the power and the latter like
that in which the power inheres, or the former being like the body and
the latter like the soul; this Parâ*s*ara also and other Sm*ri*ti
writers declare, 'As the light of a fire which abides in one place only
spreads all around, thus this whole world is the power (*s*akti) of the
highest Brahman.' The 'and' in the Sûtra implies that scriptural texts
also ('of whom the Self is the body' and others) declare that the
individual Self is a part of Brahman in so far as it is its body.

But if all individual souls are equal in so far as being alike parts of
Brahman, alike actuated by Brahman, and alike knowing subjects, what is
the reason that, as Scripture teaches, some of them are allowed to read
the Veda and act according to its injunctions, while others are excluded
therefrom; and again that some are to see, feel, and so on, while others
are excluded from these privileges?--This question is answered by the
next Sûtra.
