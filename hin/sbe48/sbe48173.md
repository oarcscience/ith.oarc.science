2\. And on account of the non-perception (of truth on the part) of
others.

The 'and' in the Sûtra has the force of 'but,' being meant to dispel the
doubt raised. There are many other authors of Sm*ri*tis, such as Manu,
who through the power of their meditation had attained insight into the
highest truth, and of whom it is known from Scripture that the purport
of their teaching was a salutary medicine to the whole world ('whatever
Manu said that was medicine'). Now, as these *Ri*shis did not see truth
in the way of Kapila, we conclude that Kapila's view, which contradicts
Scripture, is founded on error, and cannot therefore be used to modify
the sense of the Vedânta-texts.--Here finishes the adhikara*n*a treating
of 'Sm*ri*ti.'
