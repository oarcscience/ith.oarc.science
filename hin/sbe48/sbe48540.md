4\. Conductors, this being indicated.

The decision here is that light, Vâyu, and the rest mentioned in the
texts as connected with the soul's progress on the path of the Gods are
to be interpreted not as mere marks indicating the road, nor as places
of enjoyment for the soul, but as divinities appointed by the Supreme
Person to conduct the soul along the stages of the road; for this is
indicated by what the *Kh*andogya. says with regard to the last stage,
viz. lightning, 'There is a person not human, he leads them to Brahman.'
What here is said as to that person not human, viz. that he leads the
soul, is to be extended to the other beings also, light and the
rest.--But if that not human person leads the souls from lightning to
Brahman, what then about Varu*n*a, Indra, and Pra*g*âpati, who, as was
decided above, are in charge of stages beyond lightning? Do they also
lead the soul along their stages?
