4\. That (is united) with the ruler, on account of the going to it, and
so on.

As from the statements that speech becomes united with mind and mind
with breath it follows that speech and

mind are united with mind and breath only; so we conclude from the
subsequent clause 'breath with fire' that breath becomes united with
fire only.--Against this primâ facie view the Sûtra declares 'that
breath becomes united with the ruler of the organs, i.e. the individual
soul, on account of the going to it, and so on.' That breath goes to the
individual soul, the following text declares, 'At the time of death all
the prâ*n*as go to the Self of a man about to expire ' (B*ri*. Up. IV,
3, 38), Similarly Scripture mentions the departure of prâ*n*a together
with the soul, 'after him thus departing the prawa departs'; and again
its staying together with the soul, 'What is that by whose departure I
shall depart, and by whose staying I shall stay?' (Pr. Up. VI, 3). We
therefore conclude that the text 'breath with fire' means that breath
joined with the individual soul becomes united with fire. Analogously we
may say in ordinary life that the Yamuna is flowing towards the sea,
while in reality it is the Yamuna joined with the Gangâ which flows
on.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the ruler.'
