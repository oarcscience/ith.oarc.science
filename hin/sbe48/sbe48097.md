31\. On account of meditation, Bâdari thinks.

The teacher Bâdari thinks that the representation in the text of the
supreme Self in the form of a man is for the purpose of devout
meditation. 'He who in this way meditates on that Vai*s*vânara Self as
"prâde*s*amâtra" and "abhivimâna," he eats food in all worlds, in all
beings, in all Selfs.' What this text enjoins is devout meditation for
the purpose of reaching Brahman. 'In this way' means 'as having a human
form.' And 'the eating' of food in all worlds, &c. means the gaining of
intuitional knowledge of Brahman which abides everywhere and is in
itself of the nature of supreme bliss. The special kind of food, i.e.
the special objects of enjoyment which belong to the different Selfs
standing under the influence of karman cannot be meant here; for those
limited objects have to be shunned by those who desire final release. A
further question arises. If Vai*s*vânara is the highest Self, how can
the text say that the altar is its chest, the grass on the altar its
hairs, and so

on? (V, 18, 2.) Such a statement has a sense only if we understand by
Vai*s*vânara the intestinal fire.--This difficulty the next Sûtra
elucidates.
