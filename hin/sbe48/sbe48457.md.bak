10\. (It is) non-comprehensive.

The scriptural declaration does not refer to all meditations, but only
to the meditation on the Udgîtha. In the clause 'what he does with
knowledge,' the 'what' is in itself indefinite, and therefore must be
defined as connecting itself with the Udgîtha mentioned in the previous
clause, 'Let him meditate on the Udgîtha.' The sentence cannot be
construed to mean 'whatever he does is to be done with knowledge,' but
means 'that which he does with knowledge becomes more vigorous,' and
*that which is* done with knowledge that is the Udgîtha. The next Sûtra
refutes the argument set forth in Sûtra 5.
