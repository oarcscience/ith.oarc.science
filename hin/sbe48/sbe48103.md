by "anî*s*â"; but when he sees the other one, the Lord, contented, and
his glory; then his grief passes away' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 2). This, and

her who is not 'î*s*a,' i.e. Prak*ri*ti, the object of fruition. But its
grief passes away when it sees him who is other than itself, i.e. the
beloved Lord of all, and his greatness which consists in his ruling the
entire world.
