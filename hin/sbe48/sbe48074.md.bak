8\. Should it be said that there is attainment of fruition (of pleasure
and pain); we reply, not so, on account of difference.

But, if the highest Brahman is assumed to dwell within bodies, like the
individual soul, it follows that, like the latter, it is subject to the
experience of pleasure and pain, such experience springing from
connexion with bodies!--Of this objection the Sûtra disposes by
remarking 'not so, on account of difference (of reason).' For what is
the cause of experiences, pleasurable or painful, is not the mere
dwelling within a body, but rather the subjection to the influence of
good and evil deeds; and such subjection is impossible in the case of
the highest Self to which all evil is foreign. Compare the scriptural
text 'One of the two eats the sweet fruit, the other one looks on
without eating'

\[paragraph continues\] (Mu. Up. III, 1, 1).--Here finishes the
adhikara*n*a of 'what is known everywhere.'

Well then, if the highest Self is not an enjoyer, we must conclude that
wherever fruition is referred to, the embodied soul only is meant!--Of
this view the next adhikara*n*a disposes.
