40\. On account of the impossibility of origination.

The Sûtras now proceed to refute a further doubt, viz.

that the Pa*ñk*arâtra tantra--which sets forth the means of attaining
supreme beatitude, as declared by the Lord (Bhagavat)--may also be
destitute of authority, in so far, namely, as belonging to the same
class as the tantras of Kapila and others. The above Sûtra raises the
doubt.

The theory of the Bhâgavatas is that from Vâsudeva, who is the highest
Brahman and the highest cause, there originates the individual soul
called Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a; from Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a the internal
organ called Pradyumna; and from Pradyumna the principle of egoity
called Aniruddha. Now this theory implies the origination of the
individual soul, and this is contrary to Scripture. For scriptural texts
declare the soul to be without a beginning--cp. 'the intelligent one is
not born and does not die' (Ka. Up. II, 18), and other texts.
