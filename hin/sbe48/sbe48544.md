8\. But on account of nearness there is that designation.

Hira*n*yagarbha is the first created being (as declared by the text 'he
who creates Brahma'); he thus stands near to Brahman, and therefore may
be designated by the same term (viz. Brahman). This explanation is
necessitated by the reasons set forth in the preceding Sûtras (which
show that the real highest Brahman cannot be meant).--But, if the soul
advancing on the path of the Gods reaches Hira*n*yagarbha only, texts
such as 'This is the path of the Gods, the path of Brahman; those who
proceed on that path do not return to the life of man' (*Kh*. Up. IV,
15, 6), and 'moving upwards by that a man reaches immortality' (VIII, 6,
6), are wrong in asserting that that soul attains to immortality and
does not return; for the holy books teach that Hira*n*yagarbha, as a
created being, passes away at the end of a dviparârdha-period; and the
text 'Up to the world of Brahman the worlds return again' (Bha. Gî.
VIII, 16) shows that those who have gone to Hira*n*yagarbha necessarily
return also.
