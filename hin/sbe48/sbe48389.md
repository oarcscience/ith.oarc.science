5\. (Meditation) thus being equal, there is combination (of gu*n*as); on
account of non-difference of purport in the case of what subserves
injunction.

The meditation in all Vedânta-texts thus being the same, the qualities
mentioned in one text are to be combined with those mentioned in
another; 'on account of non-difference of purport in the case of what
subserves injunction.' We find that in connexion with certain
injunctions of meditation--such as the meditation on Vai*s*vânara, or
the small ether within the heart--the text of some individual
Vedânta-book mentions certain secondary matters (qualities, gu*n*a)
which subserve that meditation; and as these gu*n*as are connected with
the meditation they are to be comprised in it, so that they may
accomplish their aim, i.e. of subserving the meditation. For the same
reason therefore we have to enclose in the meditation gu*n*as mentioned
in other Vedânta-texts; for being also connected with the meditation
they subserve it in the same way.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of
'what is intimated by all Vedânta-texts.
