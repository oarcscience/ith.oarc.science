15\. And Scripture declares the difference.

The text, 'He who meditates on name as Brahman, for him there is
movement as he wishes as far as name extends,' &c. (*Kh*. Up. VII, 1
ff.), declares that those who meditate on the series of symbols
beginning with name and ending with prâ*n*a attain to a result of
limited nature and not depending on any particular path. Those therefore
who meditate on the Intelligent either as mixed with the Non-intelligent
or by itself, viewing it either under the aspect of Brahman or as
separated from Brahman, are not led on by the conducting deities. On the
other hand, it remains a settled conclusion that the deities speed on
their way those who meditate on the highest Brahman and on the soul as
separated from Prak*ri*ti and having Brahman for its true Self.--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the effected.'
