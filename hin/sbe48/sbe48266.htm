<P>20. On account of (its) passing out, moving and returning.</P>
<P>The Self is not omnipresent, but on the contrary, of atomic size (a<I>n</I>u).--How is this known?--Since Scripture says that it passes out, goes and returns. Its passing out is described in the following passage 'by that light this Self departs, either through the eye, or through the skull, or through other parts of the body' (B<I>ri.</I> Up. IV, 4, 2). Its going in the following text 'all those who pass away out of this world go to the moon,' and its returning in the text 'from that world he comes again into this world, for action.' All this going, and so on, cannot be reconciled with the soul being present everywhere.</P>
