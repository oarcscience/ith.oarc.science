If the internal organ were the agent, it would be such even in that
final state of meditation, called samâdhi, which is the instrument of
Release. But that state consists therein that the meditating being
realises its difference from Prak*ri*ti, and this is a conception which
Prak*ri*ti itself (of which the internal organ is only a modification)
cannot form. The Self alone, therefore, is the agent. But this would
imply that the activity of the Self is never at rest! Of this difficulty
the next Sûtra disposes.
