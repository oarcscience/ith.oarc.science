<P>59. They belong to the constituent members, as the bases.</P>
<P>A doubt arises whether meditations such as the one enjoined in the text, 'Let him meditate on the syllable Om as the Udg&icirc;tha,' which are connected with constituent elements of the sacrifice such as the Udg&icirc;tha, contribute towards the accomplishment of the sacrifice, and hence must be performed at the sacrifice as part of it; or whether they, like the godohana vessel, benefit the agent apart from the sacrifice, and therefore may be undertaken according to desire.--But has it not been already decided under III, 3, 42 that those meditations are generally beneficial to man, and not therefore restricted to the sacrifices?--True; it is just for the purpose of further confirming that conclusion that objections are now raised against it on the ground of some inferential marks (linga) and reasoning. For there it was maintained on the strength of the text 'therefore he does both' that those meditations have results independent of the sacrifice. But there are several reasons favouring the view that those meditations must be connected with the sacrifices as subordinate members, just as the Udg&icirc;tha and the rest to which the meditations refer.</P>
<P>Their case is by no means analogous to that of the godohana vessel, for, while in the case of the latter, the text expressly declares the existence of a special result, 'For him who is desirous of cattle he is to bring water in a godohana,' the texts enjoining those meditations do not state special results for them. For clauses such as 'he is to meditate on the Udg&icirc;tha' intimate only that the Udg&icirc;tha is connected with the meditation; while their connexion with certain results is known from other clauses, such as 'whatever he does with knowledge, with faith, with the</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Upanishad, that is more vigorous' (according to which the result of such meditations is only to strengthen the result of the sacrifices). And when a meditation of this kind has, on the ground of its connexion with the Udg&icirc;tha or the like--which themselves are invariably connected with sacrifices--been cognised to form an element of a sacrifice, some other passage which may declare a fruit for that meditation can only be taken as an arthav&acirc;da; just as the passage which declares that he whose sacrificial ladle is made of par<I>n</I>a wood does not hear an evil sound. In the same way, therefore, as the Udg&icirc;tha and so on, which are the bases of those meditations, are to be employed only as constituent parts of the sacrifices, so the meditations also connected with those constituent parts are themselves to be employed as constituent parts of the sacrifices only.</P>
