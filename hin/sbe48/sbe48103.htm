<P>by "an&icirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;"; but when he sees the other one, the Lord, contented, and his glory; then his grief passes away' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 2). This, and similar texts, speak of that one, i.e. the one previously described as the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;c., as different from the individual soul.--The text means--the individual soul grieves, being bewildered by her who is not '&icirc;<I>s</I>a,' i.e. Prak<I>ri</I>ti, the object of fruition. But its grief passes away when it sees him who is other than itself, i.e. the beloved Lord of all, and his greatness which consists in his ruling the entire world.</P>
