35\. On account of the inferential sign further on, together with
*K*aitraratha.

The kshattriya-hood of *G*âna*s*ruti is further to be accepted on
account of the Kshattriya Abhipratârin *K*aitraratha, who is mentioned
further on in this very same Sa*m*vargavidyâ which Raikva imparts to
*G*âna*s*ruti.--But why?--As follows. The section beginning 'Once a
Brahma*k*ârin

begged of Saunaka Kâpeya and Abhipratârin Kâkshaseni while being waited
on at their meal,' and ending 'thus do we, O Brahma*k*ârin, meditate on
that being,' shows Kâpeya, Abhipratârin, and the Brahma*k*ârin to be
connected with the Sa*m*varga-vidyâ. Now Abhipratârin is a Kshattriya,
the other two are Brâhma*n*as. This shows that there are connected with
the vidyâ, Brâhma*n*as, and from among non-Brâhma*n*as, a Kshattriya
only, but not a *S*ûdra. It therefore appears appropriate to infer that
the person, other than the Brâhma*n*a Raikva, who is likewise connected
with this vidyâ, viz. *G*ânasruti, is likewise a Kshattriya, not a
*S*ûdra.--But how do we know that Abhipratârin is a *K*aitraratha and a
Kshattriya? Neither of these circumstances is stated in the legend in
the Sa*m*varga-vidyâ! To this question the Sûtra replies, 'on account of
the inferential mark.' From the inferential mark that *S*aunaka Kâpeya
and Abhipratârin Kâkshaseni are said to have been sitting together at a
meal we understand that there is some connexion between Abhipratârin and
the Kâpeyas. Now another scriptural passage runs as follows: 'The
Kâpeyas made *K*aitraratha perform that sacrifice' (Tâ*nd* Brâ. XX, 12,
5), and this shows that one connected with the Kâpeyas was a
*K*aitraratha; and a further text shows that a *K*aitraratha is a
Kshattriya. 'from him there was descended a *K*aitraratha who was a
prince.' All this favours the inference that Abhipratârin was a
*K*aitraratha and a Kshattriya.

So far the Sûtras have shown that there is no inferential mark to prove
what is contradicted by reasoning, viz. the qualification of the
*S*ûdras. The next Sûtra declares that the non-qualification of the
*S*ûdra proved by reasoning is confirmed by Scripture and Sm*ri*ti.
