<P>62. And on account of the declaration of a quality being common (to all the Vedas).</P>
<P>The text 'By means of that syllable the threefold knowledge proceeds. With <I>Om</I> the Adhvaryu gives orders,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_684"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 684</FONT></A></P>
<P>with <I>Om</I> the Hot<I>ri</I> recites, with <I>Om</I> the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> sings,' which declares the pra<I>n</I>ava--which is a 'quality' of the meditation, in so far as it is its basis--to be common to the three Vedas, further shows that the meditation has to be employed in connexion with the sacrifice. For the meditation is connected with the Udg&icirc;tha, and the Udgitha is an integral part of all sacrificial performances whatever.</P>
<P>Of the prim&acirc; facie view thus far set forth the next S&ucirc;tra disposes.</P>
