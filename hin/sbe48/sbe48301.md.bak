3\. On account of speech having for its antecedent that.

For the following reason also the word 'prâ*n*a,' in the text quoted,
can denote Brahman only. Speech, i.e. the names which have for their
object all things apart from Brahman, presupposes the existence of the
entire universe of things--ether, and so on--which is the object of
speech. But, as according to the text 'this was then non-differentiated;
it was thereupon differentiated by names and forms,' then (i.e. before
the differentiation of individual things), no things having name and
form existed, there existed also no effects of speech and the other
organs of action and sensation, and hence it cannot be inferred that
those organs themselves existed.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of
'the origination of the prâ*n*as.'
