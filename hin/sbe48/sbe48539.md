3\. Beyond lightning there is Varu*n*a, on account of connexion.

According to the text of the Kaushîtakins the soul goes on to the world
of Vâyu, to the world of Varu*n*a, to the world of Indra, to the world
of Pra*g*âpati, to the world of Brahman. The doubt here arises whether
Varu*n*a and the divinities of the following stages are to be inserted
in the series after Vâyu, in agreement with the order of enumeration in
the text of the Kaushîtakins; or at the end of the whole series as
stated in the *Kh*ândogya. Up. (IV, 15, 5), Varu*n*a thus coming after
lightning.--The decision is in favour of the latter view because
Varu*n*a, the god of waters, is naturally connected with lightning which
dwells within the clouds.--This terminates the adhikara*n*a of
'Varu*n*a.'
