# SECOND ADHYÂYA

## FIRST PÂDA.

1\. If it be said that there would result the fault of there being no
room for (certain) Sm*ri*tis: (we reply) 'no,' because there would
result the fault of want of room for other Sm*ri*tis.

The first adhyâya has established the truth that what the Vedânta-texts
teach is a Supreme Brahman, which is something different as well from
non-sentient matter known through the ordinary means of proof, viz.
Perception and so on, as from the intelligent souls whether connected
with or separated from matter; which is free from even a shadow of
imperfection of any kind; which is an ocean as it were of auspicious
qualities and so on; which is the sole cause of the entire Universe;
which constitutes the inner Self of all things. The second adhyâya is
now begun for the purpose of proving that the view thus set forth cannot
be impugned by whatever arguments may possibly be brought forward. The
Sûtrakâra at first turns against those who maintain that the
Vedanta-texts do not establish the view indicated above, on the ground
of that view being contradicted by the Sm*ri*ti of Kapila, i. e. the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-system.

But how can it be maintained at all that Scripture does not set forth a
certain view because thereby it would enter into conflict with Sm*ri*ti?
For that Sm*ri*ti if contradicted by Scripture is to be held of no
account, is already settled in the Pûrva Mîmâ*m*sâ ('But where there is
contradiction Sm*ri*ti is not to be regarded,' I, 3, 3).--Where, we
reply, a matter can be definitely settled on the basis of Scripture--as
e.g. in the case of the Vedic injunction, 'he is to sing, after having
touched the U*d*umbara branch' (which clearly contradicts the Sm*ri*ti
injunction that the whole branch is to be covered up)--Sm*ri*ti indeed

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

need not be regarded. But the topic with which the Vedânta-texts are
concerned is hard to understand, and hence, when a conflict arises
between those texts and a Sm*ri*ti propounded by some great *Ri*shi, the
matter does not admit of immediate decisive settlement: it is not
therefore unreasonable to undertake to prove by Sm*ri*ti that Scripture
does not set forth a certain doctrine. That is to say--we possess a
Sm*ri*ti composed with a view to teach men the nature and means of
supreme happiness, by the great *Ri*shi Kapila to whom Scripture,
Sm*ri*ti, Itihâsa and Purâ*n*a alike refer as a person worthy of all
respect (compare e. g. 'the *Ri*shi Kapila,' *S*vet. Up. V, 2), and who
moreover (unlike B*ri*haspati and other Sm*ri*ti--writers) fully
acknowledges the validity of all the means of earthly happiness which
are set forth in the karmakâ*n*da of the Veda, such as the daily
oblations to the sacred fires, the New and Full Moon offerings and the
great Soma sacrifices. Now, as men having only an imperfect knowledge of
the Veda, and moreover naturally slow-minded, can hardly ascertain the
sense of the Vedânta-texts without the assistance of such a Sm*ri*ti,
and as to be satisfied with that sense of the Vedânta which discloses
itself on a mere superficial study of the text would imply the admission
that the whole Sâ<u>n</u>khya Sm*ri*ti, although composed by an able and
trustworthy person, really is useless; we see ourselves driven to
acknowledge that the doctrine of the Vedânta-texts cannot differ from
the one established by the Sâ<u>n</u>khyas. Nor must you object that to
do so would force on us another unacceptable conclusion, viz. that those
Sm*ri*tis, that of Manu e.g., which maintain Brahman to be the universal
cause, are destitute of authority; for Manu and similar works inculcate
practical religious duty and thus have at any rate the uncontested
function of supporting the teaching of the karmakâ*n*da of the Veda. The
Sâ<u>n</u>khya Sm*ri*ti, on the other hand, is entirely devoted to the
setting forth of theoretical truth (not of practical duty), and if it is
not accepted in that quality, it is of no use whatsoever.--On this
ground the Sûtra sets forth the primâ facie view,

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

\[paragraph continues\] 'If it be said that there results the fault of
there being no room for certain Sm*ri*tis.'

The same Sûtra replies 'no; because there would result the fault of want
of room for other Sm*ri*tis.' For other Sm*ri*tis, that of Manu e.g.,
teach that Brahman is the universal cause. Thus Manu says, 'This (world)
existed in the shape of darkness, and so on. Then the divine Self
existent, indiscernible but making discernible all this, the great
elements and the rest, appeared with irresistible power, dispelling the
darkness. He, desiring to produce beings of many kinds from his own
body, first with a thought created the waters, and placed his seed in
them' (Manu I, 5-8). And the Bhagavad-gitâ, 'I am the origin and the
dissolution of the whole Universe' (VII, 6). 'I am the origin of all;
everything proceeds from me' (X, 8). Similarly, in the Mahâbhârata, to
the question 'Whence was created this whole world with its movable and
immovable beings?' the answer is given, 'Nârâya*n*a assumes the form of
the world, he the infinite, eternal one'; and 'from him there originates
the Unevolved consisting of the three gu*n*as'; and 'the Unevolved is
merged in the non-acting Person.' And Parâ*s*ara says, 'From Vish*n*u
there sprang the world and in him it abides; he makes this world persist
and he rules it--he is the world.' Thus also Âpastamba, 'The living
beings are the dwelling of him who lies in all caves, who is not killed,
who is spotless'; and 'From him spring all bodies; he is the primary
cause, he is eternal, permanent.' (Dharmasû. I, 8, 22, 4; 23, 2).--If
the question as to the meaning of the Vedânta-texts were to be settled
by means of Kapila's Sm*ri*ti, we should have to accept the extremely
undesirable conclusion that all the Sm*ri*tis quoted are of no
authority. It is true that the Vedânta-texts are concerned with
theoretical truth lying outside the sphere of Perception and the other
means of knowledge, and that hence students possessing only a limited
knowledge of the Veda require some help in order fully to make out the
meaning of the Vedânta. But what must be avoided in this case is to give
any opening for the conclusion that the very numerous

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Sm*ri*tis which closely follow the doctrine of
the Vedânta, are composed by the most competent and trustworthy persons
and aim at supporting that doctrine, are irrelevant; and it is for this
reason that Kapila's Sm*ri*ti which contains a doctrine opposed to
Scripture must be disregarded. The support required is elucidation of
the sense conveyed by Scripture, and this clearly cannot be effected by
means of a Sm*ri*ti contradicting Scripture. Nor is it of any avail to
plead, as the Pûrvapakshin does, that Manu and other Sm*ri*tis of the
same kind fulfil in any case the function of elucidating the acts of
religious duty enjoined in the karmakâ*n*da. For if they enjoin acts of
religious duty as means to win the favour of the Supreme Person but do
not impress upon us the idea of that Supreme Person himself who is to be
pleased by those acts, they are also not capable of impressing upon us
the idea of those acts themselves. That it is the character of all
religious acts to win the favour of the Supreme Spirit, Sm*ri*ti
distinctly declares, 'Man attains to perfection by worshipping with his
proper action Him from whom all Beings proceed; and by whom all this is
stretched out' (Bha. Gî. XVIII, 46); 'Let a man meditate on Nârâya*n*a,
the divine one, at all works, such as bathing and the like; he will then
reach the world of Brahman and not return hither' (Daksha-sm*ri*ti); and
'Those men with whom, intent on their duties, thou art pleased, O Lord,
they pass beyond all this Mâya and find Release for their souls' (Vi.
Pu.). Nor can it be said that Manu and similar Sm*ri*tis have a function
in so far as setting forth works (not aiming at final Release but)
bringing about certain results included in transmigratory existence,
whether here on earth or in a heavenly world; for the essential
character of those works also is to please the highest Person. As is
said in the Bhagavad-gîtâ (IX, 23, 24); 'Even they who devoted to other
gods worship them with faith, worship me, against ordinance. For I am
the enjoyer and the Lord of all sacrifices; but they know me not in
truth and hence they fall,' and 'Thou art ever worshipped by me with
sacrifices; thou alone, bearing the form of

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

pit*ri*s and of gods, enjoyest all the offerings made to either.' Nor
finally can we admit the contention that it is rational to interpret the
Vedánta-texts in accordance with Kapila's Sm*ri*ti because Kapila, in
the *S*vetâ*s*vatara text, is referred to as a competent person. For
from this it would follow that, as B*ri*haspati is, in *S*ruti and
Sm*ri*ti, mentioned as a pattern of consummate wisdom, Scripture should
be interpreted in agreement with the openly materialistic and atheistic
Sm*ri*ti composed by that authority. But, it may here be said, the
Vedânta-texts should after all be interpreted in agreement with Kapila's
Sm*ri*ti, for the reason that Kapila had through the power of his
concentrated meditation (yoga) arrived at an insight into truth.--To
this objection the next Sûtra replies.
