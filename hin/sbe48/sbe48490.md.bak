43\. But in either case (such men) stand outside; on account of Sm*ri*ti
and custom.

Whether the point under discussion constitutes a minor or a major
offence, in any case those who have lapsed stand outside the category of
those qualified for the knowledge of Brahman. For Sm*ri*ti, i.e. the
text quoted above, 'I see no expiatory performance by which he, a slayer
of Brahman as he is, could become pure again,' declares that expiations
are powerless to restore purity. And custom confirms the same
conclusion; for good men shun those Naish*th*ikas who have lapsed, even
after they have performed prâyas*k*ittas, and do not impart to them the
knowledge of Brahman, The conclusion, therefore, is that such men are
not qualified for knowing Brahman.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of
'him who has become that.'

44\. By the Lord (of the sacrifice), since Scripture declares a
fruit--thus Âtreya thinks.

A doubt arises whether the meditations on such constituent elements of
the sacrifice as the Udgîtha, and so on, are to be performed by the
sacrificer (for whose benefit the sacrifice is offered), or by the
officiating priests. Âtreya advocates the former view; on the ground of
Scripture showing that in the case of such meditations as the one on the
small ether within the heart, fruit and meditation belong to the same
person, and that in the case of such meditations as the one on the
Udgîtha the fruit belongs to the sacrificer (whence we conclude that the
meditation also is his). Nor can it be said that the sacrificer is not
competent for such meditation, for the reason that like the godohana
vessel it is connected with an element of the sacrifice (which latter
the priests only can perform). For the godohana vessel serves to bring
water, and this of course none else can do but the Adhvaryu; while a
meditation on the Udgîtha as being the essence of all essences can very
well be performed by the Sacrificer--true though

it be that the Udgîtha itself can be performed by the Udgât*ri* priest
only.--Against this view the next Sûtra declares itself.
