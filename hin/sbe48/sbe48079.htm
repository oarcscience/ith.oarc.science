<P>13. (The Person) within the eye (is the highest Self) on account of suitability.</P>
<P>The <I>Kh</I>andogas have the following text: 'The Person that is seen within the eye, that is the Self. This is the immortal, the fearless, this is Brahman' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. IV, 15, 1). The doubt here arises whether the person that is here spoken of as abiding within the eye is the reflected Self, or some divine being presiding over the sense of sight, or the embodied Self, or the highest Self.--It is the reflected Self, the P&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains; for the text refers to the person seen as something well known, and the expression, 'is seen,' clearly refers to something directly perceived. Or it may be the individual soul, for that also may be referred to as something well known, as it is in special connexion with the eye: people, by looking into the open eye of a person, determine whether the living soul remains in him or is departing. Or else we may assume that the Person seen within the eye is some particular divine being, on the strength of the scriptural text, B<I>ri</I>. Up. V, 5, 2, 'He (the person seen within the sun) rests with his rays in him (the person within the eye).' Any of these beings may quite suitably be referred to as something well known.--Of these alternatives the S&ucirc;tra disposes by declaring that the Person within the eye is the highest Self. For the text goes on to say about the Person seen within the eye, 'They call him Sa<I>m</I>yadv&acirc;ma, for all blessings go towards him. He is also V&acirc;man&icirc;, for he leads all blessings. He is also Bh&acirc;man&icirc;, for he shines in all worlds.' And all these attributes can be reconciled with the highest Self only.</P>
