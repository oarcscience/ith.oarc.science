<P>40. On account of the impossibility of origination.</P>
<P>The S&ucirc;tras now proceed to refute a further doubt, viz.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_524"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 524</FONT></A></P>
<P>that the Pa<I>&ntilde;k</I>ar&acirc;tra tantra--which sets forth the means of attaining supreme beatitude, as declared by the Lord (Bhagavat)--may also be destitute of authority, in so far, namely, as belonging to the same class as the tantras of Kapila and others. The above S&ucirc;tra raises the doubt.</P>
<P>The theory of the Bh&acirc;gavatas is that from V&acirc;sudeva, who is the highest Brahman and the highest cause, there originates the individual soul called Sa<U>n</U>karsha<I>n</I>a; from Sa<U>n</U>karsha<I>n</I>a the internal organ called Pradyumna; and from Pradyumna the principle of egoity called Aniruddha. Now this theory implies the origination of the individual soul, and this is contrary to Scripture. For scriptural texts declare the soul to be without a beginning--cp. 'the intelligent one is not born and does not die' (Ka. Up. II, 18), and other texts.</P>
