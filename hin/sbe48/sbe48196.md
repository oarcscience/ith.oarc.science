27\. But on account of Scripture; (Brahman's possession of various
powers) being founded upon the word.

The 'but' sets aside the difficulty raised. There is no

inappropriateness; 'on account of Scripture.' Scripture declares on the
one hand that Brahman is not made up of parts, and on the other that
from it a multiform creation proceeds. And in matters vouched for by
Scripture we must conform our ideas to what Scripture actually
says.--But then Scripture might be capable of conveying to us ideas of
things altogether self-contradictory; like as if somebody were to tell
us 'Water with fire'!--The Sûtra therefore adds 'on account of its being
founded on the word.' As the possession, on Brahman's part, of various
powers (enabling it to emit the world) rests exclusively on the
authority of the word of the Veda and thus differs altogether from other
matters (which fall within the sphere of the other means of knowledge
also), the admission of such powers is not contrary to reason. Brahman
cannot be either proved or disproved by means of generalisations from
experience.
