16\. On account of scriptural statement of difference, and on account of
difference of characteristics.

Texts such as 'from him is born prâ*n*a, and the internal organ, and all
organs' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) mention the vital breath separately from the
organs, and this shows that the breath is not one of the organs. The
passage indeed mentions the internal organ (manas) also as something
separate; but in other passages the manas is formally included in the
organs, 'the (five) organs with mind as the sixth' (Bha. Gî. XV, 7).
That the vital breath differs in nature from the organ of sight and the
rest, is a matter of observation. For in the state of deep sleep the
function of breath is seen to continue, while those of the eye, and so
on, are not perceived. The work of the organs, inclusive of the manas,
is to act as instruments of cognition and action, while the work of
breath is to maintain the body and the organs. It is for the reason that
the subsistence of the organs depends on breath, that the organs
themselves are called prâ*n*as. Thus Scripture says, 'they all became
the form of that (breath), and therefore they are called after him
prâ*n*as' (B*ri*. Up. I, 5, 21). 'They became

its form' means--they became its body, their activity depended on
it.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of'the *organs*.'
