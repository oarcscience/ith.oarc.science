<P>32. There would result permanent consciousness or non-consciousness, or else limitative restriction to either.</P>
<P>On the other view, i.e. on the view of the Self being omnipresent and mere knowledge, it would follow either that consciousness and also non-consciousness would permanently take place together everywhere; or else that there would be definite permanent restriction to either of the two, i.e. either permanent consciousness or permanent non-consciousness.--If the omnipresent Self, consisting of mere knowledge only, were the cause of all that actual consciousness and non-consciousness on the part of Selfs which takes place in the world, it might be conceived either as the cause of both--i.e. consciousness and non-consciousness--and this would mean that there is everywhere and at all times simultaneous consciousness and non-consciousness. If, on the other hand, it were the cause of consciousness only, there would never and nowhere be unconsciousness of anything; and if it were the cause of non-consciousness only, there would never and nowhere be consciousness of anything. On our view, on the other hand, the actually perceived distribution of consciousness and non-consciousness explains itself, since we hold the Self to abide within bodies only, so that naturally consciousness takes place there only, not anywhere else.--The view, finally (held by the Vai<I>s</I>eshikas), of the consciousness of the Self depending on its organs (mind, senses, &amp;c.; while the omnipresent Self is, apart from those organs, non-sentient, <I>g</I>a<I>d</I>a), results in the same difficulties as the view criticised above; for as all the Selfs are omnipresent they are in permanent conjunction with all organs; and moreover it would follow that the ad<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>as (due to the actions of the different bodies) could</P>

<P>Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the <I>knower</I>.'</P>
