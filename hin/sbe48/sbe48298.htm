<P>yet the separation of the spheres of enjoyment is not impossible since the places of Brahman which are connected with the up&acirc;dhis are distinct.--This the S&ucirc;tra negatives on the ground that, as the up&acirc;dhis move here and there and hence all places enter into connexion with all up&acirc;dhis, the mixing up of spheres of enjoyment cannot be avoided. And even if the up&acirc;dhis were connected with different places, the pain connected with some particular place would affect the whole of Brahman which is one only.--The two S&ucirc;tras II, 3, 32 and 37 have stated an objection against those who, without taking their stand on the Veda, held the view of an all-pervading soul. The S&ucirc;tras II, 3, 50 and ff., on the other hand, combat the view of those who, while basing their doctrine on the Veda, teach the absolute unity of the Self.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the part.'</P>
