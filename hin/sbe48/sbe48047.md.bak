14\. If, on account of its being a word denoting an effect, (ânandamaya
be said) not (to denote the highest Self); (we say) no, on account of
abundance.

We deny the conclusion of the Pûrvapakshin, on the ground of there being
abundance of bliss in the highest Brahman, and 'abundance' being one of
the possible meanings of -maya.--Since bliss such as described in the
Taitt. Up.--bliss which is reached by successively multiplying by
hundred all inferior kinds of bliss--cannot belong to the individual
soul, we conclude that it belongs to Brahman; and as Brahman cannot be
an effect, and as -maya. may have the sense of 'abounding in,' we
conclude that the ânandamaya is Brahman itself; inner contradiction
obliging us to set aside that sense of -maya which is recommended by
regard to 'consequence' and frequency of usage. The regard for
consistency, moreover, already has to be set aside in the case of the
'prâ*n*amaya'; for in that term -maya

cannot denote 'made of.' The 'prâ*n*amaya' Self can only be called by
that name in so far as air with its five modifications has (among
others) the modification called prâ*n*a, i.e. breathing out, or because
among the five modifications or functions of air prâ*n*a is the
'abounding,' i.e. prevailing one.--Nor can it be truly said that -maya
is but rarely used in the sense of 'abounding in': expressions such as
'a sacrifice abounding in food' (annamaya), 'a procession with many
carriages' (*s*aka*t*amayî), are by no means uncommon.--Nor can we admit
that to call something 'abounding in bliss' implies the presence of
*some* pain. For 'abundance' precludes paucity on the part of that which
is said to abound, but does not imply the presence of what is contrary.
The presence or absence of what is contrary has to be ascertained by
other means of proof; and in our case we do ascertain the absence of
what is contrary to bliss by such means, viz. the clause 'free from
evil,' &c. Abundance of bliss on the part of Brahman certainly implies a
relation to paucity on the part of some other bliss; and in accordance
with this demand the text says 'That is one measure of human bliss,' &c.
(II, 8, 1). The bliss of Brahman is of measureless abundance, compared
to the bliss of the individual soul.--Nor can it be maintained that the
individual soul may be viewed as being an effect of bliss. For that a
soul whose essential nature is knowledge and bliss should in any way be
changed into something else, as a lump of clay is made into a pot, is an
assumption contradicted by all scripture, sacred tradition, and
reasoning. That in the Sa*m*sâra state the soul's bliss and knowledge
are contracted owing to karman will be shown later on.--The Self of
bliss therefore is other than the individual soul; it is Brahman itself.

A further reason for this conclusion is supplied by the next Sûtra.
