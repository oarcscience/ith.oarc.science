18\. If it be said that (this) is to be explained through successive
causality; we say 'no,' on account of their not being the causes of
aggregation.

'If it be said that through the successive causality of Nescience and so
on, the formation of aggregates and other matters may be satisfactorily
accounted for.' To explain. Although all the entities (acknowledged by
the Bauddhas) have a merely momentary existence, yet all that is
accounted for by avidyâ. Avidyâ means that conception, contrary to
reality, by which permanency, and so on, are ascribed to what is
momentary, and so on. Through avidyâ there are originated desire,
aversion, &c., which are comprised under the general term 'impression'
(sa*m*skâra); and from those there springs cognition (vi*gñ*âna) which
consists in the 'kindling' of mind; from that mind (*k*itta) and what is
of the nature of mind (*k*aitta) and the substances possessing colour,
and so on. viz. earth, water, &c. From that again the six sense-organs,
called 'the six abodes'; from that the body, called 'touch' (spar*s*a);
from that sensation (vedanâ), and so on. And from that again avidyâ, and
the whole series as described; so that there is an endlessly revolving
cycle, in which avidyâ, and so on, are in turn the causes of the links
succeeding them. Now all this is not possible without those aggregates
of the elements and elemental things which are called earth, and so on;
and thereby the rationality of the formation of those aggregates is
proved.

To this the second half of the Sûtra replies 'Not so, on

account of (their) not being the causes of aggregation'.- This cannot
rationally be assumed, because avidyâ, and so on, cannot be operative
causes with regard to the aggregation of earth and the other elements
and elemental things. For avidyâ, which consists in the view of
permanency and so on, belonging to what is non-permanent, and desire,
aversion and the rest, which are originated by avidyâ cannot constitute
the causes of (other) momentary things entering into aggregation; not
any more than the mistaken idea of shell-silver is the cause of the
aggregation of things such as shells. Moreover, on the Bauddha doctrine,
he who views a momentary thing as permanent himself perishes at the same
moment; who then is the subject in whom the so-called sa*m*skâras. i.e.
desire, aversion, and so on, originate? Those who do not acknowledge one
permanent substance constituting the abode of the sa*m*skâras have no
right to assume the continuance of the sa*m*skâras.
