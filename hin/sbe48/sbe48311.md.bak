13\. But the rule (over the prâ*n*as) on the part of Fire and the rest,
together with him to whom the prâ*n*a belong (i.e. the soul), is owing
to the thinking of that (viz. the highest Self); on account of
scriptural statement.

It has been shown that the prâ*n*as, together with the main prâ*n*a,
originate from Brahman, and have a limited size. That the prâ*n*as are
guided by Agni and other divine beings has also been explained on a
previous occasion, viz. under Sû. II, 1, 5. And it is known from
ordinary experience that the organs are ruled by the individual soul,
which uses them as means of experience and fruition. And this is also
established by scriptural texts, such as 'Having taken these prâ*n*as he
(i.e. the soul) moves about in his own body, according to his
pleasure'(B*ri*. Up. II, 1, 18). The question now arises whether the
rule of the soul and of the presiding divine beings over the prâ*n*as
depends on them (i.e. the soul and the divinities) only, or on some
other being.--On them only, since they depend on no one else!--Not so,
the Sûtra declares. The rule which light, and so on, i.e. Agni and the
other divinities, together with him to whom the prâ*n*as belong i.e. the
soul, exercise over the prâ*n*as, proceeds from the thinking of that,
i.e. from the will of the highest Self.--How is this known?--'From
scriptural statement.' For Scripture teaches that the organs, together
with their guiding divinities and the individual soul, depend in all
their doings on the thought of the highest Person. 'He, who abiding
within Fire, rules Fire from within.--He, who abiding within the
air--within the Self--within the eye, and so on' (B*ri*. Up III, 7);
'From fear of it the wind blows, from fear of it the sun rises, from
fear of it Agni and Indra, yea Death runs as the fifth' (Taitt. Up. II,
8, 1); 'By the command of that Imperishable one, sun and moon stand,
held apart'(B*ri* Up III, 8, 9).
