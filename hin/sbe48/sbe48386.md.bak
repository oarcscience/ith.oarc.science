2\. If it be said (that the vidyâs are not one) on account of
difference, we deny this, since even in one (vidyâ there may be
repetition).

If it be said that there is no oneness of vidyâ, because the fact of the
same matter being stated again without difference, and being met with in
a different chapter, proves the object of injunction to be different; we
reply that even in one and the same vidyâ some matter may be repeated
without any change, and under a new heading (in a different chapter);
if, namely, there is difference of cognising subjects. Where the
cognising person is one only, repetition of the same matter under a new
heading can only be explained as meaning difference of object enjoined,
and hence separation of the two vidyâs. But where the cognising persons
are different (and this of course is eminently so in the case of
different *s*âkhâs), the double statement of one and the same matter
explains itself as subserving the cognition of those different persons,
and hence does not imply difference of matter enjoined.--The next Sûtra

refutes the argument founded on a rite enjoined in the Mu*nd*aka.
