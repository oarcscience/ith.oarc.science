17\. According to some (a class of good works) other than these, of both
kinds.

The text quoted above from one *s*âkhâ ('His friends enter upon his good
deeds') refers to good works other than the Agnihotra and the rest, the
only object of which is to give rise to knowledge, viz. to all those
manifold good works, previous or subsequent to the attaining to
knowledge, the results of which are obstructed by other works of greater
strength. Those texts also which declare works not to cling or to be
destroyed through knowledge refer to this same class of works.--The next
Sûtra recalls the fact, already previously established, that the results
of works actually performed may somehow be obstructed.
