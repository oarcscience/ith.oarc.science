of two kinds, viz. those who do not do what is enjoined, and those who
do what is forbidden.--These also go to the moon, the Pûrvapakshin
maintains; for the text contains a statement to that effect, 'All who
depart from this world go to the moon' (Ka. Up. I, 2)--where it is said
that all go, without any distinction. So that those who perform good
works and those who perform evil works, equally go to the moon.--This
the next Sûtra negatives.
