28\. And on account of difference of nature (they are) not like dreams.

Owing to the different nature of dream-cognitions, it cannot be said
that, like them, the cognitions of the waking state also have no things
to correspond to them. For dream-cognitions are originated by organs
impaired by certain defects, such as drowsiness, and are moreover
sublated by the cognitions of the waking state; while the cognitions of
the waking state are of a contrary nature. There is thus no equality
between the two sets.--Moreover, if all cognitions are empty of real
content, you are unable to prove what you wish to prove since your
inferential cognition also is devoid of true content. If, on the other
hand, it be held to have a real content, then it follows that no
cognition is devoid of such content; for all of them are alike
cognitions, just like the inferential cognition.
