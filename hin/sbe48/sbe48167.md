25\. And on account of both being directly declared.

The conclusion arrived at above is based not only on scriptural
declaration, illustrative instances and statements of reflection; but in
addition Scripture directly states that Brahman alone is the material as
well as operative cause of the world. 'What was the wood, what the tree

your minds, whereon it stood, supporting the worlds.--Brahman was the
wood, Brahman the tree from which they shaped heaven and earth; you wise
ones, I tell you, it stood on Brahman, supporting the worlds.'--Here a
question is asked, suggested by the ordinary worldly view, as to what
was the material and instruments used by Brahman when creating; and the
answer--based on the insight that there is nothing unreasonable in
ascribing all possible powers to Brahman which differs from all other
beings--declares that Brahman itself is the material

and the instruments;--whereby the ordinary view is disposed of.--The
next Sûtra supplies a further reason.
