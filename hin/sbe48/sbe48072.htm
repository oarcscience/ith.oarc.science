<P>6. And on account of Sm<I>ri</I>ti.</P>
<P>'I dwell within the hearts of all, from me come memory and knowledge, as well as their loss'; 'He who free from delusion knows me to be the highest Person'; 'The Lord, O Ar<I>g</I>una, is seated in the heart of all Beings, driving round by his mysterious power all beings as if mounted on a machine; to him fly for refuge' (Bha. Gi. XV, 15, 19; XVIII, 61). These Sm<I>ri</I>ti-texts show the embodied soul to be the meditating subject, and the highest Self the object of meditation.</P>
