39\. But better than that is the other also on account of an inferential
mark.

Better than to be outside the â*s*ramas is the condition of standing
within an â*s*rama. The latter state may be due to misfortune; but he
who can should be within an â*s*rama, which state is the more holy and
beneficial one. This follows from inference only, i.e. Sm*ri*ti; for
Sm*ri*ti says, 'A Brâhma*n*a is to remain outside the â*s*ramas not even
for one day.' For one who has passed beyond the stage of Brahma*k*arya,
or whose wife has died, the impossibility to procure a wife constitutes
the misfortune (which prevents him from belonging to an â*s*rama).--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'widowers.'
