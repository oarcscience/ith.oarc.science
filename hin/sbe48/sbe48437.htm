<P>53. But those (meditations) which are connected with members (of sacrifices) are not (restricted) to (particular) <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s, but rather (belong) to all <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s.</P>

<P>There are certain meditations connected with certain constituent elements of sacrifices-as e.g. 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om (as) the Udg&icirc;tha '(<I>Kh.</I> Up. I, 1, 1); 'Let a man meditate on the fivefold Saman as the five worlds' (<I>Kh.</I> Up. II, 2, 1), &amp;c. The question here arises whether those meditations are restricted to the members of those <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s in whose texts they are mentioned; or to be connected with the Udg&icirc;tha, and so on, in all <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s. There is here a legitimate ground for doubt, in so far as, although the general agreement of all Ved&acirc;nta-texts is established, the Udg&icirc;tha, and so on, are different in each Veda since the accents differ in the different Vedas--The P&ucirc;rvapakshin declares that those meditations are limited each to its particular <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;; for, he says, the injunction 'Let him meditate on the Udg&icirc;tha' does indeed, verbally, refer to the Udg&icirc;tha in general; but as what stands nearest to this injunction is the special Udg&icirc;tha of the <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;, in whose text this injunction occurs, and which shares the peculiarities of accent characteristic of that <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;, we decide that the meditation is enjoined on members of that <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; only.--The S&ucirc;tra sets this opinion aside. The injunction of meditations of this type is valid for all <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s, since the text expressly connects them with the Udg&icirc;tha in general. They therefore hold good wherever there is an Udg&icirc;tha. The individual Udg&icirc;thas of the several <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s are indeed distinguished by different accentuation; but the general statement, 'Let him meditate on the Udg&icirc;tha.' suggests to the mind not any particular Udg&icirc;tha, but <I>the</I> Udg&icirc;tha in general, and hence there is no reason to restrict the meditation to a particular <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;. From the principle moreover that all <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s teach the same doctrine, it follows that the sacrifice enjoined in the different <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s is one only; and hence there is no reason to hold that the Udg&icirc;tha suggested by the injunction of the meditation is a particular one. For the Udg&icirc;tha is only an element in the sacrifice, and the sacrifice is one and the same. The meditations are not therefore limited to particular <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s.</P>
