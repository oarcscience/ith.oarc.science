22\. The same is declared by Sm*ri*ti also.

Sm*ri*ti also declares that the transmigrating soul when reaching the
state of Release 'imitates,' i.e. attains supreme equality of attributes
with the highest Brahman. 'Abiding by this knowledge they, attaining to
equality of attributes with me, are not born again at the time of
creation, nor are they affected by the general dissolution of the world'
(Bha. Gî. XIV, 2).

Some maintain that the last two Sûtras constitute a separate
adhikara*n*a (head of discussion), meant to prove that the text Mu. Up.
II, 2, 10 ('After him the shining one, everything shines; by the light
of him all this is lighted'), refers to the highest Brahman. This view
is, however, inadmissible, for the reason that with regard to the text
quoted no pûrvapaksha can arise, it having been proved under I, 2, 21
ff., and 1,3, 1, ff., that the whole section of which that text forms
part is concerned with Brahman; and it further having been shown under
I, 1, 24 ff., that Brahman is apprehended under the form of light.--The
interpretation moreover does not fit in with the wording of the
Sûtras.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of the 'small one.'
