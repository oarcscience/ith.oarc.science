6\. And on account of the impossibility of the relation of principal
(and subordinate) matter.

You Sâ<u>n</u>khyas maintain that the origination of the world results
from a certain relation between principal and subordinate entities which

and superiority of the gu*n*as--'according to the difference of the
abodes of the several gu*n*as' (Sâ<u>n</u>khya Kâ. I, 16).

But, as in the pralaya state the three gu*n*as are in a state of
equipoise, none of them being superior or inferior to the others, that
relation of superiority and subordination cannot then exist, and hence
the world cannot originate. Should it, on the other hand, be maintained
that even in the pralaya state there is a certain inequality, it would
follow therefrom that creation is eternal.
