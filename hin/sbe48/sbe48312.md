14\. And on account of the eternity of this.

As the quality, inhering in all things, of being ruled by the highest
Self, is eternal and definitely fixed by being connected with his
essential nature, it is an unavoidable conclusion that the rule of the
soul and of the divinities over the organs depends on the will of the
highest Self. The text, 'Having sent forth this he entered into it,
having entered into it he became sat and tyat' (Taitt. Up. II, 6), shows
that the entering on the part of the highest Person

into all things, so as to be their ruler, is connected with his
essential nature. Similarly Sm*ri*ti says, 'Pervading this entire
Universe by a portion of mine I do abide' (Bha. Gî. X, 42).--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the rule of Fire and the rest.'
