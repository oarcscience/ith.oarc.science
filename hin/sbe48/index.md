### First Pâda

[First Pâda](sbe48003)  
[1. Then therefore the enquiry into Brahman](sbe48004)  
[The Small Pûrvapaksha](sbe48005)  
[The Small Siddhânta](sbe48006)  
[The Great Pûrvapaksha](sbe48007)  
[The Great Siddhânta.](sbe48008)  
[There is no proof of non-differenced substance](sbe48009)  
[Sabda proves difference](sbe48010)  
[Pratyaksha--even of the nirvikalpaka kind--proves
difference](sbe48011)  
[The bhedâbheda view is untenable](sbe48012)  
[Inference also teaches difference](sbe48013)  
[Perception does not reveal mere being](sbe48014)  
[Plurality is not unreal](sbe48015)  
[Being and consciousness are not one](sbe48016)  
[The true meaning of Svayamprakâsatva](sbe48017)  
[Consciousness is not eternal](sbe48018)  
[There is no consciousness without object](sbe48019)  
[Consciousness is capable of change](sbe48020)  
[Consciousness is the attribute of a permanent Conscious
self](sbe48021)  
[The view that the conscious subject is something unreal, due to the
ahamkâra, cannot be maintained](sbe48022)  
[The conscious subject persists in deep sleep](sbe48023)  
[The conscious subject persists in the state of release](sbe48024)  
[In cases of Scripture conflicting with Perception, Scripture is not
stronger. The True cannot be known through the Untrue](sbe48025)  
[No scriptural texts teach a Brahman devoid of all
difference](sbe48026)  
[Nor do Smriti and Purâna teach such a doctrine](sbe48027)  
[The theory of Nescience cannot be proved](sbe48028)  
[All knowledge is of the Real](sbe48029)  
[Neither Scripture nor Smriti and Purâna teach Nescience](sbe48030)  
[Scripture does not teach that Release is due to the knowledge of a
non-qualified Brahman.--the meaning of 'tat tvam asi.'](sbe48031)  
[Summary statement as to the way in which different scriptural texts are
to reconciled](sbe48032)  
[Nescience cannot be terminated by the simple act of cognising Brahman
as the universal self](sbe48033)  
[The Vedântin aiming to ascertain the nature of Brahman from
Scripture,...](sbe48034)  
[2. Brahman is that from which the origin of this world
proceed](sbe48035)  
[3. Because Scripture is the source of the knowledge of
Brahman](sbe48036)  
[4. The connexion of Scripture with the highest aim of man](sbe48037)  
[5. Seeing that which is not founded on Scripture...](sbe48038)  
[6. ...the word 'seeing' has a secondary (figurative)
meaning](sbe48039)  
[7. Because release is taught of him who takes his stand on
it](sbe48040)  
[8. And because there is no statement of its having to be set
aside](sbe48041)  
[9. And on account of the contradiction of the initial
statement](sbe48042)  
[10. On account of (the individual soul) going to the Self](sbe48043)  
[11. On account of the uniformity of view](sbe48044)  
[12. And because it is directly stated in Scripture](sbe48045)  
[13. The Self consisting of Bliss is the highest Self on account of
multiplication](sbe48046)  
[14. If, on account of its being a word denoting an
effect...](sbe48047)  
[15. And because he is declared to be the cause of thatra](sbe48048)  
[16. And because that (Brahman) which is referred to in the
mantra...](sbe48049)  
[17. Not the other, on account of impossibility](sbe48050)  
[18. And on account of the declaration of difference](sbe48051)  
[19. And on account of desire, there is no regard to what is
inferred](sbe48052)  
[20. And Scripture teaches the joining of this with that](sbe48053)  
[21. The one within the sun and the eye...](sbe48054)  
[22. And on account of the declaration of difference](sbe48055)  
[23. Ether is Brahman...](sbe48056)  
[24. For the same reason breath is Brahman](sbe48057)  
[25. The light is Brahman...](sbe48058)  
[26. If it be objected that Brahman is not denoted...](sbe48059)  
[27. And thus also, because thus only the designation of the
beings...](sbe48060)  
[28. If it be said that Brahman is not recognised...](sbe48061)  
[29. Prâna is Brahman...](sbe48062)  
[30. If it be said that Brahman is not denoted...](sbe48063)  
[31. The instruction given by Indra about himself...](sbe48064)  
[32. If it be said that Brahman is not meant...](sbe48065)  
<span id="section_002"></span>

### Second Pâda

[Second Pâda](sbe48066)  
[1. Everywhere; because there is taught what is known](sbe48067)  
[2. And because the qualities meant to be stated are possible in
Brahman](sbe48068)  
[3. But, on account of impossibility, not the embodied soul](sbe48069)  
[4. And because there is (separate) denotation of the object and the
agent](sbe48070)  
[5. On account of the difference of words](sbe48071)  
[6. And on account of Smriti](sbe48072)  
[7. Should it be said that the passage does not refer to
Brahman...](sbe48073)  
[8. Should it be said that there is attainment of
fruition...](sbe48074)  
[9. The eater is the highest Self on account of there being taken all
that is movable and immovable](sbe48075)  
[10. And on account of the topic of the whole section](sbe48076)  
[11. The two entered into the cave...](sbe48077)  
[12. And on account of distinctive qualities](sbe48078)  
[13. The Person within the eye is the highest Self...](sbe48079)  
[14. And on account of the statement as to abode...](sbe48080)  
[15. And on account of the text referring only to what is characterised
by pleasure](sbe48081)  
[16. For that very reason that ether is Brahman](sbe48082)  
[17. And on account of the statement of the way of him who has heard the
Upanishads](sbe48083)  
[18. Not any other, on account of non-permanency of abode, and of
impossibility](sbe48084)  
[19. The internal Ruler ... is the highest Self](sbe48085)  
[20. And not that which Smriti assumes...](sbe48086)  
[21. For both also speak of it as something different](sbe48087)  
[22. That which possesses the qualities of invisibility...](sbe48088)  
[23. Not the two others, on account of distinction and statement of
difference](sbe48089)  
[24. And on account of the description of its form](sbe48090)  
[25. Vai*s*vânara is the highest Self...](sbe48091)  
[26. That which the text refers to is an inferential
mark--thus](sbe48092)  
[27. Should it be said that it is not so, on account of the
word...](sbe48093)  
[28. For the same reasons not the divinity and the element](sbe48094)  
[29. Gaimini thinks that there is no objection to the word
'Agni'...](sbe48095)  
[30. On account of definiteness; thus Âsmarathya opines](sbe48096)  
[31. On account of meditation, Bâdari thinks](sbe48097)  
[32. On account of imaginative identification, thus Gaimini
thinks...](sbe48098)  
[33. Moreover, they record him in that](sbe48099)  
<span id="section_003"></span>

### Third Pâda

[Third Pâda: 1. The abode of heaven, earth is the highest
Self...](sbe48100)  
[2. And on account of its being declared that to which the released have
to resort](sbe48101)  
[3. Not that which is inferred...](sbe48102)  
[4. On account of the declaration of difference](sbe48103)  
[5. On account of the subject-matter](sbe48104)  
[6. And on account of abiding and eating](sbe48105)  
[7. The bhûman is the highest Self](sbe48106)  
[8. And on account of the suitability of the attributes](sbe48107)  
[9. The Imperishable is Brahman, on account of its supporting that which
is the end of ether](sbe48108)  
[10. And this supporting springs from command...](sbe48109)  
[11. And on account of the exclusion of what is of another nature than
Brahman](sbe48110)  
[12. On account of his being designated as the object of seeing, the
highest Self is that object](sbe48111)  
[13. The small ether is Brahman...](sbe48112)  
[14. On account of the going and of the word...](sbe48113)  
[15. And on account of there being observed in that small
ether...](sbe48114)  
[16. And on account of the settled meaning](sbe48115)  
[17. If it be said that on account of reference to the other one he is
meant; we say no...](sbe48116)  
[18. ... the soul in so far as its true nature has become
manifest](sbe48117)  
[19. And the reference has a different meaning](sbe48118)  
[20. If it be said, owing to the scriptural declaration of
smallness...](sbe48119)  
[21. And on account of the imitation of that](sbe48120)  
[22. The same is declared by Smriti also](sbe48121)  
[23. On account of the term, the one measured](sbe48122)  
[24. But with reference to the heart, men being qualified](sbe48123)  
[25. Also beings above them, i.e. men...](sbe48124)  
[26. If it be said that there results a contradiction to work; we deny
this](sbe48125)  
[27. If it be said that a contradiction will result with regard to
words...](sbe48126)  
[28. And for this very reason eternity of the Veda](sbe48127)  
[29. And on account of the equality of names and forms there is no
contradiction...](sbe48128)  
[30. On account of the impossibility of qualification...](sbe48129)  
[31. And on account of (meditating on the part of the gods) being in the
Light](sbe48130)  
[33. That grief of him arose...](sbe48131)  
[34. And on account of Gâna*s*ruti kshattriya-hood being
understood](sbe48132)  
[35. On account of the inferential sign further on...](sbe48133)  
[36. On account of the reference to ceremonial
purifications...](sbe48134)  
[37. And on account of the procedure, on the ascertainment of the
non-being of that](sbe48135)  
[38. And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and
performance of (Vedic) matter](sbe48136)  
[39. And on account of Smriti](sbe48137)  
[40. On account of the trembling](sbe48138)  
[41. On account of light being seen](sbe48139)  
[42. The ether, on account of the designation of something different,
and so on](sbe48140)  
[43. On account of difference in deep sleep and departing](sbe48141)  
[44. And on account of such words as Lord](sbe48142)  
<span id="section_004"></span>

### Fourth Pâda

[Fourth Pâda: 1. If it be said that some mention that which rests on
Inference ...](sbe48143)  
[2. But the subtle body, on account of its capability](sbe48144)  
[3. Matter in its subtle state subserves an end...](sbe48145)  
[4. And on account of there being no statement of its being an object of
knowledge](sbe48146)  
[5. ... the intelligent Self is meant...](sbe48147)  
[6. And of three only there is this mention and question](sbe48148)  
[7. And as in the case of the 'Great.'](sbe48149)  
[8. On account of there being no special characteristic; as in the case
of the cup](sbe48150)  
[9. But she begins with light; for thus some read in their
text](sbe48151)  
[10. And on account of the teaching of formation ... there is no
contradiction; as in the case of the honey](sbe48152)  
[11. Not from the mention of the number even, on account of the
diversity and of the excess](sbe48153)  
[12. The breath, and so on, on the ground of the complementary
passage](sbe48154)  
[13. By light, food not being mentioned in the text of some](sbe48155)  
[14. And on account of Brahman as described being declared to be the
cause with regard to Ether, and so on](sbe48156)  
[15. From connexion](sbe48157)  
[16. Because it denotes the world](sbe48158)  
[17....the inferential marks of the individual soul and the chief vital
air](sbe48159)  
[18. But Gaimini thinks that it has another purport...](sbe48160)  
[19. On account of the connected meaning of the sentences](sbe48161)  
[20. It is a mark indicating that the promissory statement is
proved...](sbe48162)  
[21. Because (the soul) when it will depart is such; thus Audulomi
thinks](sbe48163)  
[22. On account of Brahman's abiding within the individual
soul...](sbe48164)  
[23. Brahman is the material cause...](sbe48165)  
[24. And on account of the statement of reflection](sbe48166)  
[25. And on account of both being directly declared](sbe48167)  
[26. On account of the Self making itself](sbe48168)  
[27. Owing to modification](sbe48169)  
[28. And because it is called the womb](sbe48170)  
[29. Herewith all (texts) are explained, explained](sbe48171)  
<span id="section_005"></span>

### Second Adyaya

<span id="section_006"></span>

### First Pâda

[First Pâda: 1. ... want of room for other Smritis](sbe48172)  
[2. And on account of the non-perception of truth on the part of
others](sbe48173)  
[3. Hereby the Yoga is refuted](sbe48174)  
[4. Not, on account of the difference of character of that; and its
being such (appears) from Scripture](sbe48175)  
[5. But there is denotation of the superintending deities, on account of
distinction and entering](sbe48176)  
[7. If it be said that the effect is non-existing; we say
no](sbe48177)  
[8. On account of such consequences in reabsorption the Vedânta-texts
would be inappropriate](sbe48178)  
[9. Not so; as there are parallel instances](sbe48179)  
[10. And on account of the objections to his view](sbe48180)  
[11. Also in consequence of the ill-foundedness of
reasoning](sbe48181)  
[12. Should it be said that inference is to be carried on in a different
way...](sbe48182)  
[13. Thereby also the remaining theories which are not comprised within
the Veda are explained](sbe48183)  
[14. If it be said that from Brahman becoming an enjoyer...](sbe48184)  
[15. The non-difference of the world from that Brahman...](sbe48185)  
[16. And because (the cause) is perceived in the existence of the
effect](sbe48186)  
[17. And on account of the existence of that which is
posterior](sbe48187)  
[19. And like a piece of cloth](sbe48188)  
[20. And as the different vital airs](sbe48189)  
[21. From the designation of the 'other' as non-different from
Brahman...](sbe48190)  
[22. But Brahman is additional, on account of the declaration of
difference](sbe48191)  
[23. And as in the analogous case of stones and the like, there is
impossibility of that](sbe48192)  
[24. ... as in the case of milk](sbe48193)  
[25. And as in the case of the gods...](sbe48194)  
[26. Or the consequence of the entire Brahman entering into the
effect...](sbe48195)  
[27. But on account of Scripture; Brahman's possession of various powers
being founded upon the word](sbe48196)  
[28. And thus in the Self; for there are manifold powers](sbe48197)  
[29. And on account of the defects of his view also](sbe48198)  
[30. And the divinity is endowed with all powers, because that is
seen](sbe48199)  
[31. Not, on account of the absence of organs...](sbe48200)  
[32. Brahman is not the cause; on account of the world having the nature
of what depends on a motive](sbe48201)  
[33. But it is mere sport, as in ordinary life](sbe48202)  
[34. Not inequality and cruelty...](sbe48203)  
[35. If it be said 'not so, on account of non-distinction of
deeds'...](sbe48204)  
[36. And because all the attributes are proved to be present in
Brahman](sbe48205)  
<span id="section_007"></span>

### Second Pâda

[Second Pâda: 1. Not that which is inferred, on account of the
impossibility of construction, and on account of activity](sbe48206)  
[2. If it be said--like milk or water; there also intelligence
guides](sbe48207)  
[3. And because from the independence of the Pradhâna there would follow
the non-existence of what is different from creation](sbe48208)  
[4. Nor like grass and so on; because milk does not exist
elsewhere](sbe48209)  
[5. And if you say--as the man and the stone; thus also](sbe48210)  
[6. And on account of the impossibility of the relation of principal and
subordinate matter](sbe48211)  
[7. And if another inference be made the result remains
unchanged...](sbe48212)  
[8. And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a
purpose](sbe48213)  
[9. And it is objectionable on account of the
contradictions](sbe48214)  
[10. Or in the same way as the big and long from the short and the
atomic](sbe48215)  
[11. On both assumptions also there is no motion, and thence non-being
of the origination of the world](sbe48216)  
[12. And because owing to the acknowledgment of samavâya, there results
a regressus in infinitum from equality](sbe48217)  
[13. And because the world also would thus be eternal](sbe48218)  
[14. And on account of the atoms having colour](sbe48219)  
[15. And as there are objections in both cases](sbe48220)  
[16. And as it is not accepted, it is altogether
disregarded](sbe48221)  
[17. Even on the aggregate with its two causes...](sbe48222)  
[18. If it be said that this is to be explained through successive
causality...](sbe48223)  
[19. And on account of the cessation of the preceding...](sbe48224)  
[20. There not being a cause, there results
contradiction...](sbe48225)  
[21. There is non-establishment...](sbe48226)  
[22. And on account of the objections...](sbe48227)  
[23. And in the case of space also...](sbe48228)  
[25. Not from non-entity, this not being observed](sbe48229)  
[26. And thus there would be accomplishment on the part of non-active
people also](sbe48230)  
[27. Not non-existence, on account of consciousness](sbe48231)  
[28. And on account of difference of nature they are not like
dreams](sbe48232)  
[29. The existence is not, on account of the absence of
perception](sbe48233)  
[30. And on account of its being unproved in every way](sbe48234)  
[31. Not so, on account of the impossibility in one](sbe48235)  
[33. And likewise non-entireness of the Self](sbe48236)  
[34. Nor also is there non-contradiction...](sbe48237)  
[35. And on account of the endurance of the final size...](sbe48238)  
[36. The system of the Lord must be disregarded...](sbe48239)  
[37. And on account of the impossibility of rulership](sbe48240)  
[38. ... as in the case of the organs...](sbe48241)  
[39. Finiteness or absence of omniscience](sbe48242)  
[40. On account of the impossibility of origination](sbe48243)  
[41. And there is not origination of the instrument from the
agent](sbe48244)  
[42. Or, if they are of the nature of that which is
knowledge...](sbe48245)  
[43. And on account of contradiction](sbe48246)  
<span id="section_008"></span>

### Third Pâda

[Third Pâda: 1. Not Ether...](sbe48247)  
[2. But there is](sbe48248)  
[3. It has a secondary sense...](sbe48249)  
[4. There may be a double sense](sbe48250)  
[5. The non-abandonment of the promissory statement...](sbe48251)  
[6. As follows also from other texts](sbe48252)  
[7. But the division origination extends over all
effects...](sbe48253)  
[8. Hereby air is explained](sbe48254)  
[9. But there is non-origination of that which is only](sbe48255)  
[10. Fire is produced thence](sbe48256)  
[11. Water from fire](sbe48257)  
[12. Earth from water](sbe48258)  
[13. Earth on account of the subject-matter...](sbe48259)  
[14. But he; from the inferential mark supplied by their
reflection](sbe48260)  
[15. But the order of succession...](sbe48261)  
[16. If it be said that knowledge and mind...](sbe48262)  
[17. But that which abides in the things movable and
immovable](sbe48263)  
[18. Not the Self...](sbe48264)  
[19. For this very reason the individual soul is a knower](sbe48265)  
[20. On account of its passing out, moving and returning](sbe48266)  
[21. And on account of the latter two being effected through the
Self](sbe48267)  
[22. If it be said that the soul is not atomic...](sbe48268)  
[23. And on account of the very word, and of measure](sbe48269)  
[24. ... as in the case of sandal-ointment](sbe48270)  
[25. Should it be said that this is not so on account of specialisation
of abode...](sbe48271)  
[26. Or on account of its quality as light](sbe48272)  
[27. There is distinction as in the case of smell...](sbe48273)  
[28. On account of the separate statement](sbe48274)  
[29. But the Self is designated as that because it has that
quality...](sbe48275)  
[30. And there is no objection, since the quality of knowledge exists
wherever the Self is...](sbe48276)  
[31. Since there may be manifestation of that which
exists...](sbe48277)  
[32. There would result permanent consciousness or
non-consciousness...](sbe48278)  
[33. The soul is an agent...](sbe48279)  
[34. On account of taking and the declaration as to its moving
about](sbe48280)  
[35. And on account of the designation of the Self as the agent in
actions...](sbe48281)  
[36. There would be absence of definite rule, as in the case of
consciousness](sbe48282)  
[37. On account of the inversion of power](sbe48283)  
[38. And on account of the absence of samâdhi](sbe48284)  
[39. And as the carpenter, in both ways](sbe48285)  
[40. But from the highest, this being declared by Scripture](sbe48286)  
[41. But with a view to the efforts made...](sbe48287)  
[42. The soul is a part...](sbe48288)  
[43. And on account of the mantra](sbe48289)  
[44. Moreover it is so stated in Smriti](sbe48290)  
[45. But as in the case of light...](sbe48291)  
[46. And Sm*ri*ti texts declare this](sbe48292)  
[47. Permission and exclusion result from connexion with a
body...](sbe48293)  
[48. And on account of non-connectedness there is no
confusion](sbe48294)  
[49. And it is a mere apparent argument](sbe48295)  
[50. On account of the non-determination of the adrishtas](sbe48296)  
[51. And it is thus also in the case of purposes and so on](sbe48297)  
[52. Should it be said that that is possible owing to the difference of
place...](sbe48298)  
<span id="section_009"></span>

### Fourth Pâda

[Fourth Pâda: 1. Thus the prânas](sbe48299)  
[2. The scriptural statement of the plural](sbe48300)  
[3. On account of speech having for its antecedent that](sbe48301)  
[4. They are seven...](sbe48302)  
[5. But the hands...](sbe48303)  
[6. And they are minute](sbe48304)  
[7. And the best](sbe48305)  
[8. Neither air nor function...](sbe48306)  
[9. But like the eye and the rest...](sbe48307)  
[10. And there is no objection on account of its not having an
activity](sbe48308)  
[11. It is designated as having five functions like mind](sbe48309)  
[12. And it is minute](sbe48310)  
[13. But the rule over the prâ*n*as on the part of Fire...](sbe48311)  
[14. And on account of the eternity of this](sbe48312)  
[15. They, with the exception of the best, are organs...](sbe48313)  
[16. On account of scriptural statement of difference...](sbe48314)  
[17. But the making of names and forms (belongs) to him who renders
tripartite...](sbe48315)  
[18. Flesh is of earthy nature...](sbe48316)  
[19. But on account of their distinctive nature there is that
designation, that designation](sbe48317)  
<span id="section_010"></span>

### Third Adhyâya

<span id="section_011"></span>

### First Pâda

[First Pâda: 1. In obtaining another of that, it goes enveloped, as
appears from question and explanation](sbe48318)  
[2. But on account of water consisting of the three elements; on account
of predominance](sbe48319)  
[3. And on account of the going of the prânas](sbe48320)  
[4. If it be said that it is not so on account of scriptural statement
as to going to Agni...](sbe48321)  
[5. Should it be said, on account of absence of mention in the first
reply...](sbe48322)  
[6. 'On account of this not being stated by Scripture'; not
so...](sbe48323)  
[7. Or it is metaphorical, on account of their not knowing the
Self](sbe48324)  
[8. On the passing away of the works, with a remainder...](sbe48325)  
[9. 'On account of conduct'; not so, since karana connotes
works](sbe48326)  
[10. 'There is purposelessness'; not so, on account of the dependence on
that](sbe48327)  
[11. But only good and evil works, thus Bâdari thinks](sbe48328)  
[12. Of those also who do not perform sacrifices...](sbe48329)  
[13. But of the others having enjoyed in Samyamana, there is ascent and
descent...](sbe48330)  
[14. Sm*ri*ti texts also declare this](sbe48331)  
[15. Moreover there are seven](sbe48332)  
[16. On account of his activity there also, there is no
contradiction](sbe48333)  
[17. But, of knowledge and work--as these are the leading
topics](sbe48334)  
[18. Not in the case of the third place, as it is thus
perceived](sbe48335)  
[19. It moreover is recorded, in the world](sbe48336)  
[20. And on account of its being seen](sbe48337)  
[21. The third term includes that which springs from heat](sbe48338)  
[22. There is entering into similarity of being with those, there being
a reason](sbe48339)  
[23. Not very long; on account of special statement](sbe48340)  
[24. Into plants animated by other souls](sbe48341)  
[25. It is unholy. Not so, on the ground of Scripture](sbe48342)  
[26. After that conjunction with him who performs the act of
generation](sbe48343)  
[27. From the yoni the body](sbe48344)  
<span id="section_012"></span>

### Second Pâda

[Second Pâda: 1. In the intermediate sphere the creation is effected by
the soul](sbe48345)  
[2. And some state the soul to be the shaper...](sbe48346)  
[3. But it is mere Mâyâ; on account of the true nature of the soul not
being fully manifested](sbe48347)  
[4. But owing to the wish of the highest it is hidden; for from that are
its bondage and the opposite state](sbe48348)  
[5. Or that (results) also from connexion with the body](sbe48349)  
[6. And it is suggestive, according to Scripture; this the experts also
declare](sbe48350)  
[7. The absence of that takes place in the nâdîs and in the
Self](sbe48351)  
[8. Hence the awaking from that](sbe48352)  
[9. But the same, on account of work, remembrance, text, and
injunction](sbe48353)  
[10. In the swooning person there is half-combination...](sbe48354)  
[11. Not on account of place even is there any imperfection of the
Highest; for everywhere it is described as having twofold
characteristics](sbe48355)  
[12. Should it be said 'on account of difference'...](sbe48356)  
[13. Some also teach thus](sbe48357)  
[14. For Brahman is without form merely, since it is the principal agent
with regard to that](sbe48358)  
[15. And in the same way as a Brahman consisting of light; the texts
thus not being devoid of meaning](sbe48359)  
[16. And the text says so much only](sbe48360)  
[17. This Scripture also shows, and it is also stated in
Smriti](sbe48361)  
[18. For this very reason comparisons, such as reflected images of the
sun and the like](sbe48362)  
[19. But because it is not apprehended like water, there is no
equality](sbe48363)  
[20. The participation on Brahman's part in increase and
decrease...](sbe48364)  
[21. For the text denies the previously declared so-muchness; and
declares more than that](sbe48365)  
[22. That is unmanifested; for this Scripture declares](sbe48366)  
[23. Also in perfect conciliation, according to Scripture and
Smriti](sbe48367)  
[24. And there is non-difference...](sbe48368)  
[25. Hence (Brahman is distinguished) by what is
infinite...](sbe48369)  
[26. But on account of twofold designation, as the snake and its
coils](sbe48370)  
[27. Or else like light and its abode, both being fire](sbe48371)  
[28. Or else in the manner stated above](sbe48372)  
[29. And on account of denial](sbe48373)  
[30. There is something higher than that...](sbe48374)  
[31. But on account of resemblance](sbe48375)  
[32. It subserves the purpose of thought; as in the case of the
feet](sbe48376)  
[33. Owing to difference of place, as in the case of light, and so
on](sbe48377)  
[34. And on account of possibility](sbe48378)  
[35. Thus, from the denial of anything else](sbe48379)  
[36. The omnipresence possessed by that, understood from the declaration
of extent](sbe48380)  
[37. From thence the reward; on account of possibility](sbe48381)  
[38. And on account of scriptural declaration](sbe48382)  
[39. For the same reasons *G*aimini (thinks it to be) religious
action](sbe48383)  
[40. But the former, Bâdarâyana thinks, on account of the designation of
deities as the cause](sbe48384)  
<span id="section_013"></span>

### Third Pâda

[Third Pâda: 1. What is understood from all the Vedânta-texts is one, on
account of the non-difference of injunction and the rest](sbe48385)  
[2. If it be said that the vidyâs are not one on account of
difference...](sbe48386)  
[3. For the sirovrata concerns the mode of the study of the
Veda...](sbe48387)  
[4. Scripture also declares this](sbe48388)  
[5. (Meditation) thus being equal, there is combination of
gunas](sbe48389)  
[6. If it be said that there is difference on account of the text; we
say no; on account of non-difference](sbe48390)  
[7. Or not, on account of difference of subject-matter; as in the case
of the attribute of being higher than the high](sbe48391)  
[8. If that be declared on account of name; we object](sbe48392)  
[9. And this is appropriate, on account of the extension](sbe48393)  
[10. On account of non-difference of everything, those
elsewhere](sbe48394)  
[11. Bliss and other qualities, as belonging to the subject of the
qualities](sbe48395)  
[12. Such qualities as having joy for its head, and so on, are not
established...](sbe48396)  
[13. But the others, on account of equality with the thing](sbe48397)  
[14. For meditation, owing to the absence of purpose](sbe48398)  
[15. And on account of the term 'Self.'](sbe48399)  
[16. There is reference to the Self, as in other places...](sbe48400)  
[17. If it be said 'on account of connexion'...](sbe48401)  
[18. The new (thing is enjoined); on account of the statement of what
has to be done](sbe48402)  
[19. And (the qualities) thus being equal, on account of
non-difference](sbe48403)  
[20. On account of connexion, thus elsewhere also](sbe48404)  
[21. Or not so, on account of difference](sbe48405)  
[22. The text also declares this](sbe48406)  
[23. And for the same reason the holding together and the pervading the
sky](sbe48407)  
[24. And although they both be meditations on man...](sbe48408)  
[25. On account of the difference of sense of piercing...](sbe48409)  
[26. But in the case of the getting rid of it has to be combined with
the obtaining...](sbe48410)  
[27. At departing; there being nothing to be reached...](sbe48411)  
[28. As it is desired; on account of there being no contradiction of
either](sbe48412)  
[29. There is meaning of the soul's going only on the twofold
hypothesis; for otherwise there is contradiction](sbe48413)  
[30. That assumption is justified; on account of the perception of
things which are marks of that; as in ordinary experience](sbe48414)  
[31. Of those who have a certain office there is subsistence (of their
works) as long as the office lasts](sbe48415)  
[32. There is no restriction since all have to go on that
path](sbe48416)  
[33. But the conceptions of the Imperishable are to be comprised in all
meditations](sbe48417)  
[34. So much; on account of reflection](sbe48418)  
[35. Should it be said that the former reply refers to that Self to
which the aggregate of material things belongs...](sbe48419)  
[36. There is interchange of ideas, for the texts distinguish; as in
other cases](sbe48420)  
[37. For one and the same highest divinity ... is the subject of that
meditation](sbe48421)  
[38. Wishes and the rest, here and there...](sbe48422)  
[39. On account of emphasis there is non-omission](sbe48423)  
[40. In the case of him who has approached Brahman...](sbe48424)  
[41. There is non-restriction of determination, because this is seen;
for there is a separate fruit, viz. non-obstruction](sbe48425)  
[42. Just as in the case of the offerings...](sbe48426)  
[43. On account of the plurality of indicatory marks...](sbe48427)  
[44. There is option with regard to what precedes...](sbe48428)  
[45. And on account of the transfer](sbe48429)  
[46. But it is a meditation only, on account of assertion and what is
seen](sbe48430)  
[47. And on account of the greater strength of direct statement, and so
on, there is no refutation](sbe48431)  
[48. On account of connexions and the rest, as in the case of the
separateness of other cognitions](sbe48432)  
[49. Not so, on account of this being observed on account of similarity
also; as in the case of Death; for the person in yonder orb does not
occupy the worlds of Death](sbe48433)  
[50. And by a subsequent Brâhmana also the 'being of such a kind' of the
word is proved...](sbe48434)  
[51. Some, on account of the existence of a Self within a
body](sbe48435)  
[52. But this is not so, but rather difference; since it is of the being
of that; as in the case of intuition](sbe48436)  
[53. But those meditations which are connected with members of
sacrifices are not restricted to particular sâkhâs, but rather belong to
all sâkhâs](sbe48437)  
[54. Or there is no contradiction as in the case of mantras and the
rest](sbe48438)  
[55. There is pre-eminence of plenitude, as in the case of the
sacrifice; for thus Scripture shows](sbe48439)  
[56. The meditations are separate, on account of the difference of
words, and so on](sbe48440)  
[57. Option, on account of the non-difference of result](sbe48441)  
[59. They belong to the constituent members, as the bases](sbe48442)  
[60. And on account of injunction](sbe48443)  
[61. On account of rectification](sbe48444)  
[62. And on account of the declaration of a quality being common to all
the Vedas](sbe48445)  
[63. Rather not, as the text does not declare their going
together](sbe48446)  
[64. And because (Scripture) shows it](sbe48447)  
<span id="section_014"></span>

### Fourth Pâda

[Fourth Pâda: 1. The benefit to man results from thence, on account of
scriptural statement; thus Bâdarâya*n*a thinks](sbe48448)  
[2. On account of the Self standing in a complementary relation, they
are arthavâdas...](sbe48449)  
[3. On account of such conduct being seen](sbe48450)  
[4. On account of direct scriptural statement](sbe48451)  
[5. On account of the taking hold together](sbe48452)  
[6. On account of injunction for such a one](sbe48453)  
[7. On account of definite rule](sbe48454)  
[8. But on account of the teaching of the different one...](sbe48455)  
[9. But the declarations are equal.](sbe48456)  
[10. (It is) non-comprehensive](sbe48457)  
[11. There is distribution, as in the case of the hundred](sbe48458)  
[12. Of him who has merely read the Veda](sbe48459)  
[13. Not so, on account of non-specification](sbe48460)  
[14. Or the permission is for the purpose of glorification](sbe48461)  
[15. Some also, by proceeding according to their liking](sbe48462)  
[16. And destruction](sbe48463)  
[17. And of him who is chaste...](sbe48464)  
[18. A reference only ... on account of absence of
injunction](sbe48465)  
[19. It is to be accomplished, ... on account of scriptural statement of
equality](sbe48466)  
[20. Or an injunction, as in the case of the carrying](sbe48467)  
[21. If it be said that they are mere glorification, on account of their
reference; not so, on account of the newness](sbe48468)  
[22. And on account of the words denoting becoming](sbe48469)  
[23. .. the stories told in the Upanishads ...](sbe48470)  
[24. This follows also from the textual connexion of those stories with
injunctions](sbe48471)  
[25. For this very reason there is no need of the lighting of the
fire...](sbe48472)  
[26. And there is need of all works...](sbe48473)  
[27. But all the same he must be possessed of calmness...](sbe48474)  
[28. And there is permission of all food in the case of danger of life
...](sbe48475)  
[29. And on account of non-sublation](sbe48476)  
[30. This is said in Smriti also](sbe48477)  
[31. ... as to non-proceeding according to liking](sbe48478)  
[32. The works of the â*s*ramas ...](sbe48479)  
[33. And on account of co-operativeness](sbe48480)  
[34. In any case they are the same, on account of twofold inferential
signs](sbe48481)  
[35. ... knowledge not to be overpowered](sbe48482)  
[36. Also in the case of those outside, as this is seen](sbe48483)  
[37. Smriti also states this](sbe48484)  
[38. And there is the promotion of knowledge through special acts of
duty](sbe48485)  
[39. But better than that is the other also on account of an inferential
mark](sbe48486)  
[40. But of him who has become that there is no becoming not
that...](sbe48487)  
[41. Nor the expiatory performance...](sbe48488)  
[42. A minor one, thus some; and hence they hold the existence of
expiation, as in the case of eating.](sbe48489)  
[43. But in either case such men stand outside...](sbe48490)  
[45. They are the priest's work...](sbe48491)  
[46. There is injunction of other auxiliary means...](sbe48492)  
[47. But on account of the existence of knowledge in all, there is
winding up with the householder](sbe48493)  
[48. On account of the others also being taught...](sbe48494)  
[49. Not manifesting itself; on account of the connexion](sbe48495)  
[50. What belongs to this world, there being no obstruction at hand; as
this is seen](sbe48496)  
[51. In the same way there is non-determination...](sbe48497)  
<span id="section_015"></span>

### Fourth Adhyâya

<span id="section_016"></span>

### First Pâda

[First Pâda: 1. Repetition...](sbe48498)  
[2. And on account of an inferential mark](sbe48499)  
[3. But as the Self...](sbe48500)  
[4. Not in the symbol...](sbe48501)  
[5. The view of Brahman, on account of superiority](sbe48502)  
[6. And the ideas of Âditya and the rest on the member](sbe48503)  
[7. Sitting; on account of possibility](sbe48504)  
[8. And on account of meditation](sbe48505)  
[9. And with reference to immobility](sbe48506)  
[10. And Sm*ri*ti texts say the same](sbe48507)  
[11. Where concentration of mind is possible...](sbe48508)  
[12. Up to death; for there also it is seen](sbe48509)  
[13. On the attainment of this, there result the non-clinging and the
destruction of later and earlier sins](sbe48510)  
[14. Of the other also there is thus non-clinging; but at
death](sbe48511)  
[15. But only those former works the effects of which have not yet
begun...](sbe48512)  
[16. But the Agnihotra and the rest...](sbe48513)  
[17. According to some a class of good works other than these, of both
kinds](sbe48514)  
[18. ... 'whatever he does with knowledge.'](sbe48515)  
[19. But having destroyed by fruition the other two sets he becomes one
with Brahman](sbe48516)  
<span id="section_017"></span>

### Second Pâda

[Second Pâda: 1. Speech with mind...](sbe48517)  
[2. And for the same reason all follow after](sbe48518)  
[3. That mind in breath...](sbe48519)  
[4. That is united with the ruler](sbe48520)  
[5. With the elements...](sbe48521)  
[6. Not with one...](sbe48522)  
[7. And it is common up to the beginning of the way...](sbe48523)  
[8. Since, up to the union with ... Brahman](sbe48524)  
[9. And the subtle body persists](sbe48525)  
[10. Hence not in the way of destruction of bondage](sbe48526)  
[11. And to that very subtle body there belongs the warmth](sbe48527)  
[12. ... From the embodied soul...](sbe48528)  
[13. Smriti also declares this](sbe48529)  
[14. With the Highest; for thus it says](sbe48530)  
[15. Non-division...](sbe48531)  
[16. A lighting up of the point of the abode...](sbe48532)  
[17. Following the rays](sbe48533)  
[18. ... the connexion persists as long as the body does](sbe48534)  
[19. For the same reason also during the southern progress of the
sun](sbe48535)  
[20. And those two paths are ... to be remembered](sbe48536)  
<span id="section_018"></span>

### Third Pâda

[Third Pâda: 1. On the path beginning with light...](sbe48537)  
[2. From the year to Vâyu...](sbe48538)  
[3. Beyond lightning there is Varuna](sbe48539)  
[4. Conductors, this being indicated](sbe48540)  
[5. From thence by him only who belongs to lightning](sbe48541)  
[6. Him who meditates on the effected Brahman...](sbe48542)  
[7. And on account of Brahman being specified](sbe48543)  
[8. But on account of nearness there is that designation](sbe48544)  
[9. On the passing away of the effected world of Brahma, together with
its ruler, the souls go to what is higher than that...](sbe48545)  
[10. And on account of Smriti](sbe48546)  
[11. The Highest ... on account of primariness of meaning](sbe48547)  
[12. And because Scripture declares it](sbe48548)  
[13. And there is no aiming at the effected Brahman](sbe48549)  
[14. Those not depending on symbols...](sbe48550)  
[15. And Scripture declares the difference](sbe48551)  
<span id="section_019"></span>

### Fourth Pâda

[Fourth Pâda: 1. On the soul's having approached the highest light there
is manifestation](sbe48552)  
[2. The released one; on account of the promise](sbe48553)  
[3. The Self, on account of subject-matter](sbe48554)  
[4. In non-division; because that is seen](sbe48555)
