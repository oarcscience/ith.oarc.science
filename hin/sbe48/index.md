### First Pâda

[First Pâda](sbe48003.md)  
[1. Then therefore the enquiry into Brahman](sbe48004.md)  
[The Small Pûrvapaksha](sbe48005.md)  
[The Small Siddhânta](sbe48006.md)  
[The Great Pûrvapaksha](sbe48007.md)  
[The Great Siddhânta.](sbe48008.md)  
[There is no proof of non-differenced substance](sbe48009.md)  
[Sabda proves difference](sbe48010.md)  
[Pratyaksha--even of the nirvikalpaka kind--proves
difference](sbe48011.md)  
[The bhedâbheda view is untenable](sbe48012.md)  
[Inference also teaches difference](sbe48013.md)  
[Perception does not reveal mere being](sbe48014.md)  
[Plurality is not unreal](sbe48015.md)  
[Being and consciousness are not one](sbe48016.md)  
[The true meaning of Svayamprakâsatva](sbe48017.md)  
[Consciousness is not eternal](sbe48018.md)  
[There is no consciousness without object](sbe48019.md)  
[Consciousness is capable of change](sbe48020.md)  
[Consciousness is the attribute of a permanent Conscious
self](sbe48021.md)  
[The view that the conscious subject is something unreal, due to the
ahamkâra, cannot be maintained](sbe48022.md)  
[The conscious subject persists in deep sleep](sbe48023.md)  
[The conscious subject persists in the state of release](sbe48024.md)  
[In cases of Scripture conflicting with Perception, Scripture is not
stronger. The True cannot be known through the Untrue](sbe48025.md)  
[No scriptural texts teach a Brahman devoid of all
difference](sbe48026.md)  
[Nor do Smriti and Purâna teach such a doctrine](sbe48027.md)  
[The theory of Nescience cannot be proved](sbe48028.md)  
[All knowledge is of the Real](sbe48029.md)  
[Neither Scripture nor Smriti and Purâna teach Nescience](sbe48030.md)  
[Scripture does not teach that Release is due to the knowledge of a
non-qualified Brahman.--the meaning of 'tat tvam asi.'](sbe48031.md)  
[Summary statement as to the way in which different scriptural texts are
to reconciled](sbe48032.md)  
[Nescience cannot be terminated by the simple act of cognising Brahman
as the universal self](sbe48033.md)  
[The Vedântin aiming to ascertain the nature of Brahman from
Scripture,...](sbe48034.md)  
[2. Brahman is that from which the origin of this world
proceed](sbe48035.md)  
[3. Because Scripture is the source of the knowledge of
Brahman](sbe48036.md)  
[4. The connexion of Scripture with the highest aim of man](sbe48037.md)  
[5. Seeing that which is not founded on Scripture...](sbe48038.md)  
[6. ...the word 'seeing' has a secondary (figurative)
meaning](sbe48039.md)  
[7. Because release is taught of him who takes his stand on
it](sbe48040.md)  
[8. And because there is no statement of its having to be set
aside](sbe48041.md)  
[9. And on account of the contradiction of the initial
statement](sbe48042.md)  
[10. On account of (the individual soul) going to the Self](sbe48043.md)  
[11. On account of the uniformity of view](sbe48044.md)  
[12. And because it is directly stated in Scripture](sbe48045.md)  
[13. The Self consisting of Bliss is the highest Self on account of
multiplication](sbe48046.md)  
[14. If, on account of its being a word denoting an
effect...](sbe48047.md)  
[15. And because he is declared to be the cause of thatra](sbe48048.md)  
[16. And because that (Brahman) which is referred to in the
mantra...](sbe48049.md)  
[17. Not the other, on account of impossibility](sbe48050.md)  
[18. And on account of the declaration of difference](sbe48051.md)  
[19. And on account of desire, there is no regard to what is
inferred](sbe48052.md)  
[20. And Scripture teaches the joining of this with that](sbe48053.md)  
[21. The one within the sun and the eye...](sbe48054.md)  
[22. And on account of the declaration of difference](sbe48055.md)  
[23. Ether is Brahman...](sbe48056.md)  
[24. For the same reason breath is Brahman](sbe48057.md)  
[25. The light is Brahman...](sbe48058.md)  
[26. If it be objected that Brahman is not denoted...](sbe48059.md)  
[27. And thus also, because thus only the designation of the
beings...](sbe48060.md)  
[28. If it be said that Brahman is not recognised...](sbe48061.md)  
[29. Prâna is Brahman...](sbe48062.md)  
[30. If it be said that Brahman is not denoted...](sbe48063.md)  
[31. The instruction given by Indra about himself...](sbe48064.md)  
[32. If it be said that Brahman is not meant...](sbe48065.md)  
<span id="section_002"></span>

### Second Pâda

[Second Pâda](sbe48066.md)  
[1. Everywhere; because there is taught what is known](sbe48067.md)  
[2. And because the qualities meant to be stated are possible in
Brahman](sbe48068.md)  
[3. But, on account of impossibility, not the embodied soul](sbe48069.md)  
[4. And because there is (separate) denotation of the object and the
agent](sbe48070.md)  
[5. On account of the difference of words](sbe48071.md)  
[6. And on account of Smriti](sbe48072.md)  
[7. Should it be said that the passage does not refer to
Brahman...](sbe48073.md)  
[8. Should it be said that there is attainment of
fruition...](sbe48074.md)  
[9. The eater is the highest Self on account of there being taken all
that is movable and immovable](sbe48075.md)  
[10. And on account of the topic of the whole section](sbe48076.md)  
[11. The two entered into the cave...](sbe48077.md)  
[12. And on account of distinctive qualities](sbe48078.md)  
[13. The Person within the eye is the highest Self...](sbe48079.md)  
[14. And on account of the statement as to abode...](sbe48080.md)  
[15. And on account of the text referring only to what is characterised
by pleasure](sbe48081.md)  
[16. For that very reason that ether is Brahman](sbe48082.md)  
[17. And on account of the statement of the way of him who has heard the
Upanishads](sbe48083.md)  
[18. Not any other, on account of non-permanency of abode, and of
impossibility](sbe48084.md)  
[19. The internal Ruler ... is the highest Self](sbe48085.md)  
[20. And not that which Smriti assumes...](sbe48086.md)  
[21. For both also speak of it as something different](sbe48087.md)  
[22. That which possesses the qualities of invisibility...](sbe48088.md)  
[23. Not the two others, on account of distinction and statement of
difference](sbe48089.md)  
[24. And on account of the description of its form](sbe48090.md)  
[25. Vai*s*vânara is the highest Self...](sbe48091.md)  
[26. That which the text refers to is an inferential
mark--thus](sbe48092.md)  
[27. Should it be said that it is not so, on account of the
word...](sbe48093.md)  
[28. For the same reasons not the divinity and the element](sbe48094.md)  
[29. Gaimini thinks that there is no objection to the word
'Agni'...](sbe48095.md)  
[30. On account of definiteness; thus Âsmarathya opines](sbe48096.md)  
[31. On account of meditation, Bâdari thinks](sbe48097.md)  
[32. On account of imaginative identification, thus Gaimini
thinks...](sbe48098.md)  
[33. Moreover, they record him in that](sbe48099.md)  
<span id="section_003"></span>

### Third Pâda

[Third Pâda: 1. The abode of heaven, earth is the highest
Self...](sbe48100.md)  
[2. And on account of its being declared that to which the released have
to resort](sbe48101.md)  
[3. Not that which is inferred...](sbe48102.md)  
[4. On account of the declaration of difference](sbe48103.md)  
[5. On account of the subject-matter](sbe48104.md)  
[6. And on account of abiding and eating](sbe48105.md)  
[7. The bhûman is the highest Self](sbe48106.md)  
[8. And on account of the suitability of the attributes](sbe48107.md)  
[9. The Imperishable is Brahman, on account of its supporting that which
is the end of ether](sbe48108.md)  
[10. And this supporting springs from command...](sbe48109.md)  
[11. And on account of the exclusion of what is of another nature than
Brahman](sbe48110.md)  
[12. On account of his being designated as the object of seeing, the
highest Self is that object](sbe48111.md)  
[13. The small ether is Brahman...](sbe48112.md)  
[14. On account of the going and of the word...](sbe48113.md)  
[15. And on account of there being observed in that small
ether...](sbe48114.md)  
[16. And on account of the settled meaning](sbe48115.md)  
[17. If it be said that on account of reference to the other one he is
meant; we say no...](sbe48116.md)  
[18. ... the soul in so far as its true nature has become
manifest](sbe48117.md)  
[19. And the reference has a different meaning](sbe48118.md)  
[20. If it be said, owing to the scriptural declaration of
smallness...](sbe48119.md)  
[21. And on account of the imitation of that](sbe48120.md)  
[22. The same is declared by Smriti also](sbe48121.md)  
[23. On account of the term, the one measured](sbe48122.md)  
[24. But with reference to the heart, men being qualified](sbe48123.md)  
[25. Also beings above them, i.e. men...](sbe48124.md)  
[26. If it be said that there results a contradiction to work; we deny
this](sbe48125.md)  
[27. If it be said that a contradiction will result with regard to
words...](sbe48126.md)  
[28. And for this very reason eternity of the Veda](sbe48127.md)  
[29. And on account of the equality of names and forms there is no
contradiction...](sbe48128.md)  
[30. On account of the impossibility of qualification...](sbe48129.md)  
[31. And on account of (meditating on the part of the gods) being in the
Light](sbe48130.md)  
[33. That grief of him arose...](sbe48131.md)  
[34. And on account of Gâna*s*ruti kshattriya-hood being
understood](sbe48132.md)  
[35. On account of the inferential sign further on...](sbe48133.md)  
[36. On account of the reference to ceremonial
purifications...](sbe48134.md)  
[37. And on account of the procedure, on the ascertainment of the
non-being of that](sbe48135.md)  
[38. And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and
performance of (Vedic) matter](sbe48136.md)  
[39. And on account of Smriti](sbe48137.md)  
[40. On account of the trembling](sbe48138.md)  
[41. On account of light being seen](sbe48139.md)  
[42. The ether, on account of the designation of something different,
and so on](sbe48140.md)  
[43. On account of difference in deep sleep and departing](sbe48141.md)  
[44. And on account of such words as Lord](sbe48142.md)  
<span id="section_004"></span>

### Fourth Pâda

[Fourth Pâda: 1. If it be said that some mention that which rests on
Inference ...](sbe48143.md)  
[2. But the subtle body, on account of its capability](sbe48144.md)  
[3. Matter in its subtle state subserves an end...](sbe48145.md)  
[4. And on account of there being no statement of its being an object of
knowledge](sbe48146.md)  
[5. ... the intelligent Self is meant...](sbe48147.md)  
[6. And of three only there is this mention and question](sbe48148.md)  
[7. And as in the case of the 'Great.'](sbe48149.md)  
[8. On account of there being no special characteristic; as in the case
of the cup](sbe48150.md)  
[9. But she begins with light; for thus some read in their
text](sbe48151.md)  
[10. And on account of the teaching of formation ... there is no
contradiction; as in the case of the honey](sbe48152.md)  
[11. Not from the mention of the number even, on account of the
diversity and of the excess](sbe48153.md)  
[12. The breath, and so on, on the ground of the complementary
passage](sbe48154.md)  
[13. By light, food not being mentioned in the text of some](sbe48155.md)  
[14. And on account of Brahman as described being declared to be the
cause with regard to Ether, and so on](sbe48156.md)  
[15. From connexion](sbe48157.md)  
[16. Because it denotes the world](sbe48158.md)  
[17....the inferential marks of the individual soul and the chief vital
air](sbe48159.md)  
[18. But Gaimini thinks that it has another purport...](sbe48160.md)  
[19. On account of the connected meaning of the sentences](sbe48161.md)  
[20. It is a mark indicating that the promissory statement is
proved...](sbe48162.md)  
[21. Because (the soul) when it will depart is such; thus Audulomi
thinks](sbe48163.md)  
[22. On account of Brahman's abiding within the individual
soul...](sbe48164.md)  
[23. Brahman is the material cause...](sbe48165.md)  
[24. And on account of the statement of reflection](sbe48166.md)  
[25. And on account of both being directly declared](sbe48167.md)  
[26. On account of the Self making itself](sbe48168.md)  
[27. Owing to modification](sbe48169.md)  
[28. And because it is called the womb](sbe48170.md)  
[29. Herewith all (texts) are explained, explained](sbe48171.md)  
<span id="section_005"></span>

### Second Adyaya

<span id="section_006"></span>

### First Pâda

[First Pâda: 1. ... want of room for other Smritis](sbe48172.md)  
[2. And on account of the non-perception of truth on the part of
others](sbe48173.md)  
[3. Hereby the Yoga is refuted](sbe48174.md)  
[4. Not, on account of the difference of character of that; and its
being such (appears) from Scripture](sbe48175.md)  
[5. But there is denotation of the superintending deities, on account of
distinction and entering](sbe48176.md)  
[7. If it be said that the effect is non-existing; we say
no](sbe48177.md)  
[8. On account of such consequences in reabsorption the Vedânta-texts
would be inappropriate](sbe48178.md)  
[9. Not so; as there are parallel instances](sbe48179.md)  
[10. And on account of the objections to his view](sbe48180.md)  
[11. Also in consequence of the ill-foundedness of
reasoning](sbe48181.md)  
[12. Should it be said that inference is to be carried on in a different
way...](sbe48182.md)  
[13. Thereby also the remaining theories which are not comprised within
the Veda are explained](sbe48183.md)  
[14. If it be said that from Brahman becoming an enjoyer...](sbe48184.md)  
[15. The non-difference of the world from that Brahman...](sbe48185.md)  
[16. And because (the cause) is perceived in the existence of the
effect](sbe48186.md)  
[17. And on account of the existence of that which is
posterior](sbe48187.md)  
[19. And like a piece of cloth](sbe48188.md)  
[20. And as the different vital airs](sbe48189.md)  
[21. From the designation of the 'other' as non-different from
Brahman...](sbe48190.md)  
[22. But Brahman is additional, on account of the declaration of
difference](sbe48191.md)  
[23. And as in the analogous case of stones and the like, there is
impossibility of that](sbe48192.md)  
[24. ... as in the case of milk](sbe48193.md)  
[25. And as in the case of the gods...](sbe48194.md)  
[26. Or the consequence of the entire Brahman entering into the
effect...](sbe48195.md)  
[27. But on account of Scripture; Brahman's possession of various powers
being founded upon the word](sbe48196.md)  
[28. And thus in the Self; for there are manifold powers](sbe48197.md)  
[29. And on account of the defects of his view also](sbe48198.md)  
[30. And the divinity is endowed with all powers, because that is
seen](sbe48199.md)  
[31. Not, on account of the absence of organs...](sbe48200.md)  
[32. Brahman is not the cause; on account of the world having the nature
of what depends on a motive](sbe48201.md)  
[33. But it is mere sport, as in ordinary life](sbe48202.md)  
[34. Not inequality and cruelty...](sbe48203.md)  
[35. If it be said 'not so, on account of non-distinction of
deeds'...](sbe48204.md)  
[36. And because all the attributes are proved to be present in
Brahman](sbe48205.md)  
<span id="section_007"></span>

### Second Pâda

[Second Pâda: 1. Not that which is inferred, on account of the
impossibility of construction, and on account of activity](sbe48206.md)  
[2. If it be said--like milk or water; there also intelligence
guides](sbe48207.md)  
[3. And because from the independence of the Pradhâna there would follow
the non-existence of what is different from creation](sbe48208.md)  
[4. Nor like grass and so on; because milk does not exist
elsewhere](sbe48209.md)  
[5. And if you say--as the man and the stone; thus also](sbe48210.md)  
[6. And on account of the impossibility of the relation of principal and
subordinate matter](sbe48211.md)  
[7. And if another inference be made the result remains
unchanged...](sbe48212.md)  
[8. And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a
purpose](sbe48213.md)  
[9. And it is objectionable on account of the
contradictions](sbe48214.md)  
[10. Or in the same way as the big and long from the short and the
atomic](sbe48215.md)  
[11. On both assumptions also there is no motion, and thence non-being
of the origination of the world](sbe48216.md)  
[12. And because owing to the acknowledgment of samavâya, there results
a regressus in infinitum from equality](sbe48217.md)  
[13. And because the world also would thus be eternal](sbe48218.md)  
[14. And on account of the atoms having colour](sbe48219.md)  
[15. And as there are objections in both cases](sbe48220.md)  
[16. And as it is not accepted, it is altogether
disregarded](sbe48221.md)  
[17. Even on the aggregate with its two causes...](sbe48222.md)  
[18. If it be said that this is to be explained through successive
causality...](sbe48223.md)  
[19. And on account of the cessation of the preceding...](sbe48224.md)  
[20. There not being a cause, there results
contradiction...](sbe48225.md)  
[21. There is non-establishment...](sbe48226.md)  
[22. And on account of the objections...](sbe48227.md)  
[23. And in the case of space also...](sbe48228.md)  
[25. Not from non-entity, this not being observed](sbe48229.md)  
[26. And thus there would be accomplishment on the part of non-active
people also](sbe48230.md)  
[27. Not non-existence, on account of consciousness](sbe48231.md)  
[28. And on account of difference of nature they are not like
dreams](sbe48232.md)  
[29. The existence is not, on account of the absence of
perception](sbe48233.md)  
[30. And on account of its being unproved in every way](sbe48234.md)  
[31. Not so, on account of the impossibility in one](sbe48235.md)  
[33. And likewise non-entireness of the Self](sbe48236.md)  
[34. Nor also is there non-contradiction...](sbe48237.md)  
[35. And on account of the endurance of the final size...](sbe48238.md)  
[36. The system of the Lord must be disregarded...](sbe48239.md)  
[37. And on account of the impossibility of rulership](sbe48240.md)  
[38. ... as in the case of the organs...](sbe48241.md)  
[39. Finiteness or absence of omniscience](sbe48242.md)  
[40. On account of the impossibility of origination](sbe48243.md)  
[41. And there is not origination of the instrument from the
agent](sbe48244.md)  
[42. Or, if they are of the nature of that which is
knowledge...](sbe48245.md)  
[43. And on account of contradiction](sbe48246.md)  
<span id="section_008"></span>

### Third Pâda

[Third Pâda: 1. Not Ether...](sbe48247.md)  
[2. But there is](sbe48248.md)  
[3. It has a secondary sense...](sbe48249.md)  
[4. There may be a double sense](sbe48250.md)  
[5. The non-abandonment of the promissory statement...](sbe48251.md)  
[6. As follows also from other texts](sbe48252.md)  
[7. But the division origination extends over all
effects...](sbe48253.md)  
[8. Hereby air is explained](sbe48254.md)  
[9. But there is non-origination of that which is only](sbe48255.md)  
[10. Fire is produced thence](sbe48256.md)  
[11. Water from fire](sbe48257.md)  
[12. Earth from water](sbe48258.md)  
[13. Earth on account of the subject-matter...](sbe48259.md)  
[14. But he; from the inferential mark supplied by their
reflection](sbe48260.md)  
[15. But the order of succession...](sbe48261.md)  
[16. If it be said that knowledge and mind...](sbe48262.md)  
[17. But that which abides in the things movable and
immovable](sbe48263.md)  
[18. Not the Self...](sbe48264.md)  
[19. For this very reason the individual soul is a knower](sbe48265.md)  
[20. On account of its passing out, moving and returning](sbe48266.md)  
[21. And on account of the latter two being effected through the
Self](sbe48267.md)  
[22. If it be said that the soul is not atomic...](sbe48268.md)  
[23. And on account of the very word, and of measure](sbe48269.md)  
[24. ... as in the case of sandal-ointment](sbe48270.md)  
[25. Should it be said that this is not so on account of specialisation
of abode...](sbe48271.md)  
[26. Or on account of its quality as light](sbe48272.md)  
[27. There is distinction as in the case of smell...](sbe48273.md)  
[28. On account of the separate statement](sbe48274.md)  
[29. But the Self is designated as that because it has that
quality...](sbe48275.md)  
[30. And there is no objection, since the quality of knowledge exists
wherever the Self is...](sbe48276.md)  
[31. Since there may be manifestation of that which
exists...](sbe48277.md)  
[32. There would result permanent consciousness or
non-consciousness...](sbe48278.md)  
[33. The soul is an agent...](sbe48279.md)  
[34. On account of taking and the declaration as to its moving
about](sbe48280.md)  
[35. And on account of the designation of the Self as the agent in
actions...](sbe48281.md)  
[36. There would be absence of definite rule, as in the case of
consciousness](sbe48282.md)  
[37. On account of the inversion of power](sbe48283.md)  
[38. And on account of the absence of samâdhi](sbe48284.md)  
[39. And as the carpenter, in both ways](sbe48285.md)  
[40. But from the highest, this being declared by Scripture](sbe48286.md)  
[41. But with a view to the efforts made...](sbe48287.md)  
[42. The soul is a part...](sbe48288.md)  
[43. And on account of the mantra](sbe48289.md)  
[44. Moreover it is so stated in Smriti](sbe48290.md)  
[45. But as in the case of light...](sbe48291.md)  
[46. And Sm*ri*ti texts declare this](sbe48292.md)  
[47. Permission and exclusion result from connexion with a
body...](sbe48293.md)  
[48. And on account of non-connectedness there is no
confusion](sbe48294.md)  
[49. And it is a mere apparent argument](sbe48295.md)  
[50. On account of the non-determination of the adrishtas](sbe48296.md)  
[51. And it is thus also in the case of purposes and so on](sbe48297.md)  
[52. Should it be said that that is possible owing to the difference of
place...](sbe48298.md)  
<span id="section_009"></span>

### Fourth Pâda

[Fourth Pâda: 1. Thus the prânas](sbe48299.md)  
[2. The scriptural statement of the plural](sbe48300.md)  
[3. On account of speech having for its antecedent that](sbe48301.md)  
[4. They are seven...](sbe48302.md)  
[5. But the hands...](sbe48303.md)  
[6. And they are minute](sbe48304.md)  
[7. And the best](sbe48305.md)  
[8. Neither air nor function...](sbe48306.md)  
[9. But like the eye and the rest...](sbe48307.md)  
[10. And there is no objection on account of its not having an
activity](sbe48308.md)  
[11. It is designated as having five functions like mind](sbe48309.md)  
[12. And it is minute](sbe48310.md)  
[13. But the rule over the prâ*n*as on the part of Fire...](sbe48311.md)  
[14. And on account of the eternity of this](sbe48312.md)  
[15. They, with the exception of the best, are organs...](sbe48313.md)  
[16. On account of scriptural statement of difference...](sbe48314.md)  
[17. But the making of names and forms (belongs) to him who renders
tripartite...](sbe48315.md)  
[18. Flesh is of earthy nature...](sbe48316.md)  
[19. But on account of their distinctive nature there is that
designation, that designation](sbe48317.md)  
<span id="section_010"></span>

### Third Adhyâya

<span id="section_011"></span>

### First Pâda

[First Pâda: 1. In obtaining another of that, it goes enveloped, as
appears from question and explanation](sbe48318.md)  
[2. But on account of water consisting of the three elements; on account
of predominance](sbe48319.md)  
[3. And on account of the going of the prânas](sbe48320.md)  
[4. If it be said that it is not so on account of scriptural statement
as to going to Agni...](sbe48321.md)  
[5. Should it be said, on account of absence of mention in the first
reply...](sbe48322.md)  
[6. 'On account of this not being stated by Scripture'; not
so...](sbe48323.md)  
[7. Or it is metaphorical, on account of their not knowing the
Self](sbe48324.md)  
[8. On the passing away of the works, with a remainder...](sbe48325.md)  
[9. 'On account of conduct'; not so, since karana connotes
works](sbe48326.md)  
[10. 'There is purposelessness'; not so, on account of the dependence on
that](sbe48327.md)  
[11. But only good and evil works, thus Bâdari thinks](sbe48328.md)  
[12. Of those also who do not perform sacrifices...](sbe48329.md)  
[13. But of the others having enjoyed in Samyamana, there is ascent and
descent...](sbe48330.md)  
[14. Sm*ri*ti texts also declare this](sbe48331.md)  
[15. Moreover there are seven](sbe48332.md)  
[16. On account of his activity there also, there is no
contradiction](sbe48333.md)  
[17. But, of knowledge and work--as these are the leading
topics](sbe48334.md)  
[18. Not in the case of the third place, as it is thus
perceived](sbe48335.md)  
[19. It moreover is recorded, in the world](sbe48336.md)  
[20. And on account of its being seen](sbe48337.md)  
[21. The third term includes that which springs from heat](sbe48338.md)  
[22. There is entering into similarity of being with those, there being
a reason](sbe48339.md)  
[23. Not very long; on account of special statement](sbe48340.md)  
[24. Into plants animated by other souls](sbe48341.md)  
[25. It is unholy. Not so, on the ground of Scripture](sbe48342.md)  
[26. After that conjunction with him who performs the act of
generation](sbe48343.md)  
[27. From the yoni the body](sbe48344.md)  
<span id="section_012"></span>

### Second Pâda

[Second Pâda: 1. In the intermediate sphere the creation is effected by
the soul](sbe48345.md)  
[2. And some state the soul to be the shaper...](sbe48346.md)  
[3. But it is mere Mâyâ; on account of the true nature of the soul not
being fully manifested](sbe48347.md)  
[4. But owing to the wish of the highest it is hidden; for from that are
its bondage and the opposite state](sbe48348.md)  
[5. Or that (results) also from connexion with the body](sbe48349.md)  
[6. And it is suggestive, according to Scripture; this the experts also
declare](sbe48350.md)  
[7. The absence of that takes place in the nâdîs and in the
Self](sbe48351.md)  
[8. Hence the awaking from that](sbe48352.md)  
[9. But the same, on account of work, remembrance, text, and
injunction](sbe48353.md)  
[10. In the swooning person there is half-combination...](sbe48354.md)  
[11. Not on account of place even is there any imperfection of the
Highest; for everywhere it is described as having twofold
characteristics](sbe48355.md)  
[12. Should it be said 'on account of difference'...](sbe48356.md)  
[13. Some also teach thus](sbe48357.md)  
[14. For Brahman is without form merely, since it is the principal agent
with regard to that](sbe48358.md)  
[15. And in the same way as a Brahman consisting of light; the texts
thus not being devoid of meaning](sbe48359.md)  
[16. And the text says so much only](sbe48360.md)  
[17. This Scripture also shows, and it is also stated in
Smriti](sbe48361.md)  
[18. For this very reason comparisons, such as reflected images of the
sun and the like](sbe48362.md)  
[19. But because it is not apprehended like water, there is no
equality](sbe48363.md)  
[20. The participation on Brahman's part in increase and
decrease...](sbe48364.md)  
[21. For the text denies the previously declared so-muchness; and
declares more than that](sbe48365.md)  
[22. That is unmanifested; for this Scripture declares](sbe48366.md)  
[23. Also in perfect conciliation, according to Scripture and
Smriti](sbe48367.md)  
[24. And there is non-difference...](sbe48368.md)  
[25. Hence (Brahman is distinguished) by what is
infinite...](sbe48369.md)  
[26. But on account of twofold designation, as the snake and its
coils](sbe48370.md)  
[27. Or else like light and its abode, both being fire](sbe48371.md)  
[28. Or else in the manner stated above](sbe48372.md)  
[29. And on account of denial](sbe48373.md)  
[30. There is something higher than that...](sbe48374.md)  
[31. But on account of resemblance](sbe48375.md)  
[32. It subserves the purpose of thought; as in the case of the
feet](sbe48376.md)  
[33. Owing to difference of place, as in the case of light, and so
on](sbe48377.md)  
[34. And on account of possibility](sbe48378.md)  
[35. Thus, from the denial of anything else](sbe48379.md)  
[36. The omnipresence possessed by that, understood from the declaration
of extent](sbe48380.md)  
[37. From thence the reward; on account of possibility](sbe48381.md)  
[38. And on account of scriptural declaration](sbe48382.md)  
[39. For the same reasons *G*aimini (thinks it to be) religious
action](sbe48383.md)  
[40. But the former, Bâdarâyana thinks, on account of the designation of
deities as the cause](sbe48384.md)  
<span id="section_013"></span>

### Third Pâda

[Third Pâda: 1. What is understood from all the Vedânta-texts is one, on
account of the non-difference of injunction and the rest](sbe48385.md)  
[2. If it be said that the vidyâs are not one on account of
difference...](sbe48386.md)  
[3. For the sirovrata concerns the mode of the study of the
Veda...](sbe48387.md)  
[4. Scripture also declares this](sbe48388.md)  
[5. (Meditation) thus being equal, there is combination of
gunas](sbe48389.md)  
[6. If it be said that there is difference on account of the text; we
say no; on account of non-difference](sbe48390.md)  
[7. Or not, on account of difference of subject-matter; as in the case
of the attribute of being higher than the high](sbe48391.md)  
[8. If that be declared on account of name; we object](sbe48392.md)  
[9. And this is appropriate, on account of the extension](sbe48393.md)  
[10. On account of non-difference of everything, those
elsewhere](sbe48394.md)  
[11. Bliss and other qualities, as belonging to the subject of the
qualities](sbe48395.md)  
[12. Such qualities as having joy for its head, and so on, are not
established...](sbe48396.md)  
[13. But the others, on account of equality with the thing](sbe48397.md)  
[14. For meditation, owing to the absence of purpose](sbe48398.md)  
[15. And on account of the term 'Self.'](sbe48399.md)  
[16. There is reference to the Self, as in other places...](sbe48400.md)  
[17. If it be said 'on account of connexion'...](sbe48401.md)  
[18. The new (thing is enjoined); on account of the statement of what
has to be done](sbe48402.md)  
[19. And (the qualities) thus being equal, on account of
non-difference](sbe48403.md)  
[20. On account of connexion, thus elsewhere also](sbe48404.md)  
[21. Or not so, on account of difference](sbe48405.md)  
[22. The text also declares this](sbe48406.md)  
[23. And for the same reason the holding together and the pervading the
sky](sbe48407.md)  
[24. And although they both be meditations on man...](sbe48408.md)  
[25. On account of the difference of sense of piercing...](sbe48409.md)  
[26. But in the case of the getting rid of it has to be combined with
the obtaining...](sbe48410.md)  
[27. At departing; there being nothing to be reached...](sbe48411.md)  
[28. As it is desired; on account of there being no contradiction of
either](sbe48412.md)  
[29. There is meaning of the soul's going only on the twofold
hypothesis; for otherwise there is contradiction](sbe48413.md)  
[30. That assumption is justified; on account of the perception of
things which are marks of that; as in ordinary experience](sbe48414.md)  
[31. Of those who have a certain office there is subsistence (of their
works) as long as the office lasts](sbe48415.md)  
[32. There is no restriction since all have to go on that
path](sbe48416.md)  
[33. But the conceptions of the Imperishable are to be comprised in all
meditations](sbe48417.md)  
[34. So much; on account of reflection](sbe48418.md)  
[35. Should it be said that the former reply refers to that Self to
which the aggregate of material things belongs...](sbe48419.md)  
[36. There is interchange of ideas, for the texts distinguish; as in
other cases](sbe48420.md)  
[37. For one and the same highest divinity ... is the subject of that
meditation](sbe48421.md)  
[38. Wishes and the rest, here and there...](sbe48422.md)  
[39. On account of emphasis there is non-omission](sbe48423.md)  
[40. In the case of him who has approached Brahman...](sbe48424.md)  
[41. There is non-restriction of determination, because this is seen;
for there is a separate fruit, viz. non-obstruction](sbe48425.md)  
[42. Just as in the case of the offerings...](sbe48426.md)  
[43. On account of the plurality of indicatory marks...](sbe48427.md)  
[44. There is option with regard to what precedes...](sbe48428.md)  
[45. And on account of the transfer](sbe48429.md)  
[46. But it is a meditation only, on account of assertion and what is
seen](sbe48430.md)  
[47. And on account of the greater strength of direct statement, and so
on, there is no refutation](sbe48431.md)  
[48. On account of connexions and the rest, as in the case of the
separateness of other cognitions](sbe48432.md)  
[49. Not so, on account of this being observed on account of similarity
also; as in the case of Death; for the person in yonder orb does not
occupy the worlds of Death](sbe48433.md)  
[50. And by a subsequent Brâhmana also the 'being of such a kind' of the
word is proved...](sbe48434.md)  
[51. Some, on account of the existence of a Self within a
body](sbe48435.md)  
[52. But this is not so, but rather difference; since it is of the being
of that; as in the case of intuition](sbe48436.md)  
[53. But those meditations which are connected with members of
sacrifices are not restricted to particular sâkhâs, but rather belong to
all sâkhâs](sbe48437.md)  
[54. Or there is no contradiction as in the case of mantras and the
rest](sbe48438.md)  
[55. There is pre-eminence of plenitude, as in the case of the
sacrifice; for thus Scripture shows](sbe48439.md)  
[56. The meditations are separate, on account of the difference of
words, and so on](sbe48440.md)  
[57. Option, on account of the non-difference of result](sbe48441.md)  
[59. They belong to the constituent members, as the bases](sbe48442.md)  
[60. And on account of injunction](sbe48443.md)  
[61. On account of rectification](sbe48444.md)  
[62. And on account of the declaration of a quality being common to all
the Vedas](sbe48445.md)  
[63. Rather not, as the text does not declare their going
together](sbe48446.md)  
[64. And because (Scripture) shows it](sbe48447.md)  
<span id="section_014"></span>

### Fourth Pâda

[Fourth Pâda: 1. The benefit to man results from thence, on account of
scriptural statement; thus Bâdarâya*n*a thinks](sbe48448.md)  
[2. On account of the Self standing in a complementary relation, they
are arthavâdas...](sbe48449.md)  
[3. On account of such conduct being seen](sbe48450.md)  
[4. On account of direct scriptural statement](sbe48451.md)  
[5. On account of the taking hold together](sbe48452.md)  
[6. On account of injunction for such a one](sbe48453.md)  
[7. On account of definite rule](sbe48454.md)  
[8. But on account of the teaching of the different one...](sbe48455.md)  
[9. But the declarations are equal.](sbe48456.md)  
[10. (It is) non-comprehensive](sbe48457.md)  
[11. There is distribution, as in the case of the hundred](sbe48458.md)  
[12. Of him who has merely read the Veda](sbe48459.md)  
[13. Not so, on account of non-specification](sbe48460.md)  
[14. Or the permission is for the purpose of glorification](sbe48461.md)  
[15. Some also, by proceeding according to their liking](sbe48462.md)  
[16. And destruction](sbe48463.md)  
[17. And of him who is chaste...](sbe48464.md)  
[18. A reference only ... on account of absence of
injunction](sbe48465.md)  
[19. It is to be accomplished, ... on account of scriptural statement of
equality](sbe48466.md)  
[20. Or an injunction, as in the case of the carrying](sbe48467.md)  
[21. If it be said that they are mere glorification, on account of their
reference; not so, on account of the newness](sbe48468.md)  
[22. And on account of the words denoting becoming](sbe48469.md)  
[23. .. the stories told in the Upanishads ...](sbe48470.md)  
[24. This follows also from the textual connexion of those stories with
injunctions](sbe48471.md)  
[25. For this very reason there is no need of the lighting of the
fire...](sbe48472.md)  
[26. And there is need of all works...](sbe48473.md)  
[27. But all the same he must be possessed of calmness...](sbe48474.md)  
[28. And there is permission of all food in the case of danger of life
...](sbe48475.md)  
[29. And on account of non-sublation](sbe48476.md)  
[30. This is said in Smriti also](sbe48477.md)  
[31. ... as to non-proceeding according to liking](sbe48478.md)  
[32. The works of the â*s*ramas ...](sbe48479.md)  
[33. And on account of co-operativeness](sbe48480.md)  
[34. In any case they are the same, on account of twofold inferential
signs](sbe48481.md)  
[35. ... knowledge not to be overpowered](sbe48482.md)  
[36. Also in the case of those outside, as this is seen](sbe48483.md)  
[37. Smriti also states this](sbe48484.md)  
[38. And there is the promotion of knowledge through special acts of
duty](sbe48485.md)  
[39. But better than that is the other also on account of an inferential
mark](sbe48486.md)  
[40. But of him who has become that there is no becoming not
that...](sbe48487.md)  
[41. Nor the expiatory performance...](sbe48488.md)  
[42. A minor one, thus some; and hence they hold the existence of
expiation, as in the case of eating.](sbe48489.md)  
[43. But in either case such men stand outside...](sbe48490.md)  
[45. They are the priest's work...](sbe48491.md)  
[46. There is injunction of other auxiliary means...](sbe48492.md)  
[47. But on account of the existence of knowledge in all, there is
winding up with the householder](sbe48493.md)  
[48. On account of the others also being taught...](sbe48494.md)  
[49. Not manifesting itself; on account of the connexion](sbe48495.md)  
[50. What belongs to this world, there being no obstruction at hand; as
this is seen](sbe48496.md)  
[51. In the same way there is non-determination...](sbe48497.md)  
<span id="section_015"></span>

### Fourth Adhyâya

<span id="section_016"></span>

### First Pâda

[First Pâda: 1. Repetition...](sbe48498.md)  
[2. And on account of an inferential mark](sbe48499.md)  
[3. But as the Self...](sbe48500.md)  
[4. Not in the symbol...](sbe48501.md)  
[5. The view of Brahman, on account of superiority](sbe48502.md)  
[6. And the ideas of Âditya and the rest on the member](sbe48503.md)  
[7. Sitting; on account of possibility](sbe48504.md)  
[8. And on account of meditation](sbe48505.md)  
[9. And with reference to immobility](sbe48506.md)  
[10. And Sm*ri*ti texts say the same](sbe48507.md)  
[11. Where concentration of mind is possible...](sbe48508.md)  
[12. Up to death; for there also it is seen](sbe48509.md)  
[13. On the attainment of this, there result the non-clinging and the
destruction of later and earlier sins](sbe48510.md)  
[14. Of the other also there is thus non-clinging; but at
death](sbe48511.md)  
[15. But only those former works the effects of which have not yet
begun...](sbe48512.md)  
[16. But the Agnihotra and the rest...](sbe48513.md)  
[17. According to some a class of good works other than these, of both
kinds](sbe48514.md)  
[18. ... 'whatever he does with knowledge.'](sbe48515.md)  
[19. But having destroyed by fruition the other two sets he becomes one
with Brahman](sbe48516.md)
