52\. Should it be said (that that is possible) owing to the difference
of place; we deny this, on account of (all upâdhis) being within (all
places).

Although Brahman is one only and not to be split by the several limiting
adjuncts with which it is connected,

yet the separation of the spheres of enjoyment is not impossible since
the places of Brahman which are connected with the upâdhis are
distinct.--This the Sûtra negatives on the ground that, as the upâdhis
move here and there and hence all places enter into connexion with all
upâdhis, the mixing up of spheres of enjoyment cannot be avoided. And
even if the upâdhis were connected with different places, the pain
connected with some particular place would affect the whole of Brahman
which is one only.--The two Sûtras II, 3, 32 and 37 have stated an
objection against those who, without taking their stand on the Veda,
held the view of an all-pervading soul. The Sûtras II, 3, 50 and ff., on
the other hand, combat the view of those who, while basing their
doctrine on the Veda, teach the absolute unity of the Self.--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the part.'
