23\. Not very long; on account of special statement.

Does the soul in its descent through ether, and so on, stay at each
stage for a not very long time, or is there nothing to define that
time?--It stays at each stage for an indefinite time, there being
nothing to define the time.--

<span id="page_597">p. 597</span>

Not so, the Sûtra decides. For there is a special statement, i.e. the
text says that when the soul has become rice or grain or the like, the
passing out of that stage is beset with difficulties. From this we infer
that as there is no such statement concerning the earlier stages, the
soul stays at each of them for a short time only.--Here terminates the
adhikara*n*a of 'the not very long time.'
