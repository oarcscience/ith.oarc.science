25\. On account of the difference of sense of piercing and so on.

The text of the Âtharva*n*ikas exhibits at the beginning of their
Upanishad some mantras, 'Pierce the *s*ukra, pierce the heart.' The
followers of the Sâma-veda read at the beginning of their
rahasya-brâhma*n*a 'O God Savit*ri*, promote the sacrifice.' The
Kâ*th*akas and the Taittirîyakas have 'May Mitra be propitious to us,
may Varu*n*a be propitious.' The Sâ*t*yâyanins have 'Thou art a white
horse, a tawny and a black one!' The Kaushîtakins have a Brâhma*n*a
referring to the Mahavrata-ceremony, 'Indra having slain V*ri*tra became
great.' The Kaushîtakins also have a Mahâvrata-brâhma*n*a. 'Pra*g*âpati
is the year; his Self is that Mahâvrata.' The Vâ*g*asaneyins have a
Brâhma*n*a referring to the Pravargya, 'The gods sat

down for a sattra-celebration.' With reference to all this a doubt
arises whether these mantras and the sacrificial works referred to in
the Brâhma*n*a texts form parts of the meditations enjoined in the
Upanishads or not.--The Pûrvapakshin affirms this, on the ground that as
the mantras and works are mentioned in the immediate neighbourhood of
the meditations the idea of their forming parts of the latter naturally
presents itself. Such mantras as 'pierce the heart' and works such as
the pravargya may indeed--on the basis of direct statement (*s*ruti),
inferential mark (linga), and syntactical connexion (vâkya), which are
stronger than mere proximity--be understood to be connected with certain
actions; but, on the other hand, mantras such as 'May Varu*n*a be
propitious' have no application elsewhere, and are suitable
introductions to meditations. We therefore take them to be parts of the
meditations, and hence hold that those mantras are to be included in all
meditations.--This view the Sûtra sets aside 'on account of the
difference of sense of piercing, and so on.' The inferential marks
contained in texts such as 'pierce the *s*ukra, pierce the heart'; 'I
shall speak the right, I shall speak the true,' show that the mantras
have an application in connexion with certain magical practices, or else
the study of the Veda, and the like, and do not therefore form part of
meditations. That is to say--in the same way as the mantra 'pierce the
heart' enables us to infer that also the mantra 'pierce the *s*ukra'
belongs to some magical rite, so we infer from the special meaning of
mantras such as 'I shall speak the right,' &c., that also mantras such
as 'May Mitra be propitious' are connected with the study of the Veda,
and do not therefore form part of meditations. That mantras of this kind
and Brâhma*n*a passages relative to the Pravargya and the like are
placed at the beginning of Upanishads is owing to their having, like the
latter, to be studied in the forest.--Herewith terminates the
adhikara*n*a of 'piercing and the like.'
