25\. For this very reason there is no need of the lighting of the fire
and so on.

The Sûtras return, from their digression into the discussion of two
special points, to the question as to those whose condition of life
involves chastity. The above Sûtra declares that as persons of that
class are referred to by Scripture as specially concerned with
meditation ('He who is founded on Brahman reaches immortality;' 'those
who in the forest,' &c.), their meditation does not presuppose a
knowledge of the kindling of fire and so on, i.e. a knowledge of the
Agnihotra, the Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa, and all those other sacrifices which
require the preliminary establishnlent of the sacred fires, but a
knowledge of those works only which are enjoined for their special
condition of life.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the kindling of
the fire.'
