8\. And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a purpose.

Even if it were admitted that the Pradhâna is established by Inference,
the Sâ<u>n</u>khya theory could not be accepted for the reason that the
Pradhâna is without a purpose. For, according to the view expressed in
the passage, 'In order that the soul may know the Pradhâna and become
isolated' (Sâ<u>n</u>khya Kâ. I, 21), the purpose of the Pradhâna is
fruition and final release on the part of the soul; but both these are
impossible. For, as the soul consists of pure intelligence, is inactive,
changeless, and spotless, and hence eternally emancipated, it is capable
neither of fruition which consists in consciousness of Prak*ri*ti, nor
of Release which consists in separation from Prak*ri*ti. If, on the
other hand, it be held that the soul constituted as described is, owing
to the mere nearness of Prak*ri*ti, capable of fruition, i.e. of being
conscious of pleasure and pain, which are special modifications of
Prak*ri*ti, it follows that, as Prak*ri*ti is ever near, the soul will
never accomplish emancipation.
