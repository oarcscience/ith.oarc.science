3\. For (the *s*irovrata) concerns the mode of the study of the Veda;
also on account of (that rite) being a heading in the samâ*k*âra; and
the restriction is like that of the libations.

What the text says as to a restriction connected with the 'vow of the
head,' does not intimate a difference of vidyâs. For that vow does not
form part of the vidyâ. The restriction refers only to a peculiarity of
the *study* of the Veda on the part of the Âtharva*n*ikas, being meant
to establish that they should possess that special qualification which
the rite produces; but it does not affect the vidyâ itself. This is
proved by the subsequent clause, 'a man who has not performed that rite
may not *read* the text,' which directly connects the rite with the
studying of the text. And it is further proved by the fact that in the
book of the Âtharva*n*ikas, called 'sâmâ*k*ara, 'that rite is referred
to as a rite connected with the Veda (not with the special vidyâ set
forth in the Mu*nd*aka), viz. in the passage, 'this is explained already
by the Veda-observance' (which extends the details of the *s*irovrata,
there called veda-vrata, to other observances). By the *knowledge of
Brahman* (referred to in the Mu*nd*aka-text 'let a man tell this science
of Brahman to those only,' &c.), we have therefore to understand
knowledge of the Veda in general. And that restriction is 'like that of
the libations'--i.e. it is analogous to the restriction under which the
sava-libations, beginning with the Saptasûrya-libation, and terminating
with the *S*ataudana-libation, are offered in the one fire which is used
by the followers of the Atharvan, and not in the ordinary three fires.
