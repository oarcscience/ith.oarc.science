<P>3. On account of speech having for its antecedent that.</P>
<P>For the following reason also the word 'pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a,' in the text quoted, can denote Brahman only. Speech, i.e. the names which have for their object all things apart from Brahman, presupposes the existence of the entire universe of things--ether, and so on--which is the object of speech. But, as according to the text 'this was then non-differentiated; it was thereupon differentiated by names and forms,' then (i.e. before the differentiation of individual things), no things having name and form existed, there existed also no effects of speech and the other organs of action and sensation, and hence it cannot be inferred that those organs themselves existed.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the origination of the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as.'</P>
