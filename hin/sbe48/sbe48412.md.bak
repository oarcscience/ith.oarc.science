28\. As it is desired; on account of there being no contradiction of
either.

The time when good and evil deeds are left behind thus having been
determined on the basis of the reason of the thing, the several words of
the passages must be construed as it is desired, i.e. so as not to
contradict either, i.e. either the declaration of scripture or the
reason of the thing. Thus in the text of the Kaushîtakins the later
clause, 'he shakes off his good and evil deeds,' must be taken as coming
before the earlier passage 'having entered on that path of the
gods.'--Here the Pûrvapakshin raises a new objection.
