7\. And on account of (Brahman) being specified.

The text 'a person not human leads them to the worlds of Brahman'
(B*ri*. Up. VI. 2, 15) by using the word 'world,' and moreover in the
plural, determines the specification that the not-human person leads
those only who meditate on Hira*n*yagarbha, who dwells within some
particular world.

\[paragraph continues\] Moreover, the text 'I enter the hall of
Pra*g*âpati, the house' (*Kh*. Up.VIII, 14) shows that he who goes on
the path beginning with light aims at approaching Hira*n*yagarbha. But
if this is so, there is a want of appropriate denotation in the clause,
'There is a person not human, he leads them to Brahman'; if
Hira*n*yagarbha is meant, the text should say 'He leads them to Brahmâ
(Brahmâ*n*am).'
