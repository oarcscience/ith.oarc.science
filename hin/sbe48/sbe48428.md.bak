44\. There is option with regard to what precedes (i.e. the altar made
of bricks) on account of subject-matter, and hence there is action; as
in the case of the mânasa cup.

In the Vâ*g*asaneyaka, in the Agnirahasya chapter, there are references
to certain altars built of mind, 'built of mind, built of speech,' &c.
The doubt here arises whether those structures of mind, and so on, which
metaphorically are called fire-altars, should be considered as being of
the nature of action, on account of their connexion with a performance
which itself is of the nature of action; or merely of the nature of
meditation, as being connected with an activity of the nature of
meditation. The Sûtra maintains the former view. Since those things
'built of mind, and so on,' are, through being *built* (or *piled up*),
constituted as fire-altars, they demand a performance with which to
connect themselves; and as in immediate proximity to them no performance
is enjoined, and as the general subject-matter of the section is the
fire-altar built of bricks--introduced by means of the clause 'Non-being
this was in the beginning'---which is invariably connected with a
performance of the nature of outward action, viz. a certain sacrificial
performance--we conclude that the altars built of mind, &c., which the
text mentions in connexion with the same subject-matter, are themselves
of the nature of action, and as such can be used as alternatives for the
altar built of bricks. <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md). An analogous
case is presented by the so-called *mental* cup. On the tenth, so-called
avivâkya, day of the Soma sacrifice extending over twelve days,

<span id="page_669">p. 669</span>

there takes place the mental offering of a Soma cup, all the rites
connected with which are rehearsed in imagination only; the offering of
that cup is thus really of the nature of thought only, but as it forms
an auxiliary element in an actual outward sacrificial performance it
itself assumes the character of an action.

actual outward construction of a brick altar there may optionally be
substituted the merely mental construction of an imaginary altar.
