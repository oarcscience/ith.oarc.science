<P>That the energies connected with the rule of the entire world are exclusive attributes of the highest Person, Scripture and Sm<I>ri</I>ti alike declare. Compare scriptural texts such as 'From fear of him the wind blows,' &amp;c. (Taitt. Up. II, 8, 1); 'By the command of that Imperishable one sun and moon stand, held apart' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. III, 9); 'He is the lord of all, the king of all beings, the protector of all beings' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. IV, 4, 22). And Sm<I>ri</I>ti texts such as 'With me as Supervisor, Prak<I>ri</I>ti brings forth the Universe of the movable and the immovable, and for this reason the world ever moves round'; 'Pervading this entire Universe by a portion of mine I do abide' (Bha. G&icirc;. IX, 10; X, 42). Scripture and Sm<I>ri</I>ti likewise declare that of the bliss which is enjoyed by the released soul the highest Person alone is the cause--'For he alone causes blessedness' (Taitt. Up. II, 7); 'He who serves me with unswerving devotion, surpasses these qualities and is fitted for becoming one with Brahman. For I am the abode of Brahman, of infinite immortality, of everlasting virtue, and of absolute bliss' (Bha. G&icirc;. XIV, 26-27). The exalted qualities of the soul--freedom from evil and sin and so on--which manifest themselves in the state of Release no doubt belong to the soul's essential nature; but that the soul is of such a nature fundamentally depends on the Supreme Person, and on him also depends the permanency of those qualities; they are permanent in so far as the Lord himself on whom they depend is permanent. It is in the same way that all the things which constitute the means of enjoyment and sport on the part of the Lord are permanent in so far as the Lord himself is permanent. It thus appears that the equality to the Lord which the released soul may claim does not extend to the world-ruling energies.</P>
