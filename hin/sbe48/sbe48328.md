11\. But only good and evil works, thus Bâdari thinks.

As the verb â-*k*ar takes karman for its object (pu*n*ya*m* karmâ
*k*arati, &c.), and as the separate denotation (i.e. the use of
apparently equivalent words, viz. â*k*ar and karman) can be accounted
for on the ground that one of them refers to works established by
manifest texts, and the other to texts inferred from actually existing
rules of good conduct; and as, when the primary meaning is possible, no
secondary meaning must be adopted; nothing else but good and evil works
(in the Vedic sense) are denoted by the word *k*ara*n*a: such is the
opinion of the teacher Bâdari. This opinion of Bâdari, the author of the
Sûtra states as representing his own. On the other hand, he adopts the
view of Kârsh*n*a*g*ini in so far as he considers such items of virtuous
*conduct* as the Sandhyâ--which are enjoined by scriptural texts, the
existence of which is inferred on the basis of conduct as enjoined by
Sm*ri*ti--to have the result of qualifying the agent for the performance
of other works.--The conclusion therefore is that the souls descend,
carrying a remnant of their works.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of
'the passing of works.'
