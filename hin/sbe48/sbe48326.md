9\. 'On account of conduct'; not so, since (*k*ara*n*a) connotes works;
thus Kârsh*n*â*g*ini thinks.

In the phrases 'those whose works were good' (rama*n*îya-*k*ara*n*â*h*),
and 'those whose works were bad' (kapûyâ-*k*ara*n*â*h*), the word
*k*ara*n*a does not denote good and evil works (i.e. not such works as
the Veda on the one hand enjoins as leading to certain rewards, and on
the other prohibits, threatening punishment), for, in Vedic as well as
ordinary language, the term *k*ara*n*a is generally used in the sense of
â*k*âra, i.e. general conduct. In ordinary speech such words as â*k*âra,
*s*îla, v*ri*tta are considered synonymous, and in the Veda we read
'whatever works (karmâ*n*i) are blameless, those should be regarded, not
others. Whatever our good conduct (su-*k*aritâni) was, that should be
observed by thee, nothing else' (Taitt. Up. I, 11, 2)--where 'works' and
'conduct' are distinguished. Difference in quality of birth therefore
depends on conduct, not on the remainder of works performed with a view
to certain results.--This primâ facie view the Sûtra sets aside, 'not
so,because the scriptural term *k*ara*n*a connotes works; thus the
teacher *K*ârsh*n*â*g*ini thinks.' For mere conduct does not lead to
experiences of pleasure and pain; pleasure and pain are the results of
*works* in the limited sense.
