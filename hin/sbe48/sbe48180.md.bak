10\. And on account of the objections to his view.

The theory of Brahman being the universal cause has to be accepted not
only because it is itself free from objections, but also because the
pradhâna theory is open to objections, and hence must be abandoned. For
on this latter theory the origination of the world cannot be accounted
for. The Sâ<u>n</u>khyas hold that owing to the soul's approximation to
Prak*ri*ti the attributes of the latter

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

are fictitiously superimposed upon the soul which in itself consists
entirely of pure intelligence free from all change, and that thereon
depends the origination of the empirical world. Now here we must raise
the question as to the nature of that approximation or nearness of
Prak*ri*ti which causes the superimposition on the changeless soul of
the attributes of Prak*ri*ti. Does that nearness mean merely the
existence of Prak*ri*ti or some change in Prak*ri*ti? or does it mean
some change in the soul?--Not the latter; for the soul is assumed to be
incapable of change.--Nor again a change in Prak*ri*ti; for changes in
Prak*ri*ti are supposed, in the system, to be the effects of
superimposition, and cannot therefore be its cause. And if, finally, the
nearness of Prak*ri*ti means no more than its existence, it follows that
even the released soul would be liable to that superimposition (for
Prak*ri*ti exists always).--The Sâ<u>n</u>khya is thus unable to give a
rational account of the origination of the world. This same point will
be treated of fully in connexion with the special refutation of the
Sâ<u>n</u>khya theory. (II, 2, 6.)
