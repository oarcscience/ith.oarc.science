11\. It is designated as having five functions like mind.

As desire, and so on, are not principles different from mind, although
they are different functions and produce different effects--according to
the text, 'Desire, purpose, doubt, faith, want of faith, firmness,
absence of firmness, shame, reflection, fear--all this is mind' (B*ri*.
Up. I,,5, 3); so, on the ground of the text, 'prâ*n*a, apâna, vyâna,
udâna, samâna--all this is prâ*n*a' (ibid.), apâna and the rest must be
held to be different functions of prâ*n*a only, not independent
principles.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of what is 'a modification
of air.'
