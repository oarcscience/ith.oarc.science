26\. If it be said that there results a contradiction to work; we deny
this, on account of the observation of the assumption of several
(bodies).

An objection here presents itself. If we admit the gods to have bodies,
a difficulty arises at the sacrifices, as it is impossible that one and
the same corporeal Indra--who is at the same time invited by many
sacrificers 'come,

\[paragraph continues\] O Indra', 'come, O Lord of the red horses,'
&c.--should be present at all those places. And that the gods, Agni and
so on, really do come to the sacrifices is proved by the following
scriptural text: 'To whose sacrifice do the gods go, and to whose not?
He who first receives the gods, sacrifices to them on the following day'
(Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 6, 7, 1). In refutation of this objection the Suûtra
points out that there is seen, i.e. recorded, the assumption of several
bodies at the same time, on the part of beings endowed with special
powers, such as Saubhari.
