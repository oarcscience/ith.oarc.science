40\. But from the highest, this being declared by Scripture.

Is the activity of the individual soul independent (free), or does it
depend on the highest Self? It is free; for if it were dependent on the
highest Self, the whole body of scriptural injunctions and prohibitions
would be unmeaning. For commandments can be addressed to such

agents only as are capable of entering on action or refraining from
action, according to their own thought and will.

This primâ facie view is set aside by the Sûtra. The activity of the
individual soul proceeds from the highest Self as its cause. For
Scripture teaches this. 'Entered within, the ruler of creatures, the
Self of all'; 'who dwelling in the Self is different from the Self, whom
the Self does not know, whose body the Self is, who rules the Self from
within, he is thy Self, the inward ruler, the immortal one.' Sm*ri*ti
teaches the same, 'I dwell within the heart of all; memory and knowledge
as well as their loss come from me'(Bha. Gî. XV, 15); 'The Lord, O
Ar*g*una, dwells in the heart of all creatures, whirling, by his
mysterious power, all creatures as if mounted on a machine' (Bha. Gî.
XVIII, 61).--But this view implies the meaninglessness of all scriptural
injunctions and prohibitions!--To this the next Sûtra replies.
