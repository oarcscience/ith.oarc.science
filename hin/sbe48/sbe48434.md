50\. And by a subsequent (Brâhma*n*a) also the 'being of such a kind' of
the word (is proved). But the connexion is on account of plurality.

The subsequent Brâhma*n*a (*S*at. Br. X, 5, 4) also proves that the text
treating of the altars made of mind, and so on, enjoins a meditation
only. For that Brâhma*n*a (which begins 'This brick-built fire-altar is
this world; the waters are its enclosing-stones,' &c.) declares further
on 'whosoever knows this thus comes to be that whole Agni who is the
space-filler,' and from this it appears that what is enjoined there is a
meditation with a special result of its own. And further on (X, 6) there
is another meditation enjoined, viz. one on Vai*s*vânara. All this shows
that the Agnirahasya book (*S*at. Br. X) is not solely concerned with
the injunction of outward sacrificial acts.--But what then is the reason
that such matters as the mental (meditative) construction of fire-altars
which ought to be included in the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka are included in
the Agnirahasya?--'That connexion is on account of plurality,' i.e. the
altars made of mind, and so on, are, in the sacred text, dealt with in
proximity to the real altar made of bricks, because so many details of
the latter are mentally to be accomplished in the meditation.--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'option with the previous one.'
