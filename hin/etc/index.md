# Miscellaneous Short Hindu Texts

These files are translations of short Hindu texts taken from various
public domain sources, primarily scholarly journals. Many of them have
been edited more or less extensively to remove both the untranslated
text that often accompanies the translation and the more specialized
notes and comments. I have made the assumption that those who need to
reference the in-depth philological discussions of these long-dead
Victorian Orientalists will have access to the original source
materials; please forgive me if I am mistaken.

There were for all intents and purposes no <u>hard</u> standards in
transcription at the time that these were written (and there are still
none today); I have done my best to represent the varied systems as
closely as possible in order to facilitate the transition to unicode
that I hope to see in the near future. A period directly before any
letter represents a dot-under, a double quote represents a dot-over, and
a forward slash (/) before a consonant represents an acute marking over
it. For /S and /s, however, I have used Š and š. Acute, grave, and
circumflex accents (over vowels) have been rendered directly in HTML,
and line-over vowels (macrons) are also shown as circumflex. Where
macrons and circumflexes appear together, macrons are shown before the
letter that they modify or otherwise noted. The º mark before a vowel
represents the 'short' (breve) diacritic; the same marking is also
sometimes used in Tibetan transcriptions and in other places, but is not
ambiguous. The œ ligature is shown as two letters in older files, but
rendered directly in the newer ones; all other diacritics are shown as
they appear in the original unless otherwise noted.

For journal title abbreviations, see the
[Journals](../../journals/index.md) page, where all the articles (including
non-Hindu) are organized according to their sources.
