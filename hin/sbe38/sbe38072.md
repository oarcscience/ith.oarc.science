18\. On account of the scriptural statement of difference.

The prâ*n*a is everywhere spoken of as different from speech, &c. The
passage, e.g. beginning with 'They said to speech' (B*ri*. Up. I, 3, 2),
enumerates speech, &c., which were overwhelmed by the evil of the
Asuras, concludes thereupon the section treating of speech, &c., and
then specially mentions the mukhya prâ*n*a as overcoming the Asuras, in
the paragraph beginning 'Then they said to the breath in the
mouth.'--Other passages also referring to that difference may be quoted,
so, for instance, 'He made mind, speech, and breath for himself (B*ri*.
Up. I, 5, 3).--For this reason also the other prâ*n*as are different in
being from the chief prâ*n*a--Another reason follows.
