*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

8\. If it be said (that the vidyâs are one) on account of (the identity
of) name; (we reply that) that is explained (already); moreover that
(identity of name) is (found in the case of admittedly separate vidyâs).

Here it might be said that after all the unity of the two vidyâs
discussed must be admitted, since they are called by one and the same
name, viz. 'the science of the udgîtha.'--But this argument is of no
avail against what has been said under the preceding Sûtra. The decision
there advocated has the advantage of following the letter of the
revealed text; the name 'udgîtha-vidyâ' on the other hand is not a part
of the revealed text, but given to the vidyâs for convenience sake by
ordinary men for the reason that the word 'udgîtha' is met with in the
text.--Moreover, we observe that admittedly separate meditations such as
the two mentioned under the last Sûtra have one and the same name.
Similarly altogether separate sacrificial performances, such as the
agnihotra, the dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa, and so on, are all comprised under
the one name Kâ*th*aka, merely because they are recorded in the one book
called Kâ*th*aka.--Where, on the other hand, there is no special reason
for assuming the difference of vidyâs, their unity may be declared on
the ground of identity of name; as, e.g. in the case of the
Sa*m*vargavidyâs.
