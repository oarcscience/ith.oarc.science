*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

40\. On account of (the passage showing) respect, there is non-omission
(of the prâ*n*âgnihotra) (even when the eating of food is omitted).

We read in the *Kh*ândogya under the heading of the Vai*s*vânara-vidyâ,
'Therefore the first food which comes is in the place of Homa. And he
who offers that first oblation should offer it to Prâ*n*a, saying Svâhâ'
(Kh., Up. V, 19, i). The text thereupon enjoins five oblations, and
later on applies to them the term 'Agnihotra;' 'He who thus knowing this
offers the agnihotra,' and 'As hungry children here on earth sit round
their mother, so do all beings sit round the agnihotra' (V, 24, 2; 4).

Here the doubt arises whether the agnihotra offered to the prâ*n*as is
to be omitted when the eating itself is omitted or not.--As, according
to the clause, 'The first food which comes,' &c., the oblation is
connected with the coming of food, and as the coming of food subserves
the eating, the agnihotra offered to the prâ*n*as is omitted when the
eating is omitted.--Against this conclusion the Sûtra (embodying the
pûrvapaksha) declares, 'It is not omitted.--Why?--'On account of the
respect.' This means: In their version of the Vai*s*vânara-vidyâ the
*G*âbâlas read as follows: 'He (i.e. the host) is to eat before his
guests; for (if he would make them eat first) it would be as if he
without having himself offered the agnihotra offered that of another
person.' This passage, which objects to the priority of the eating on
the part of the guests and establishes priority on the part of the host,
thereby intimates respect for the agnihotra offered to the prâ*n*as. For
as it does not allow the omission of priority it will allow all the less
the omission of that which is characterised by priority, viz. the
agnihotra offered to the prâ*n*as.--But (as mentioned above) the
connexion--established by the *Kh*ândogya-passage--of the oblation with
the coining of food--which subserves the eating--establishes the
omission of the oblation

in the case of the eating being omitted!--Not so, the pûrvapakshin
replies. The purpose of that passage is to enjoin some particular
material (to be offered). For the fundamental agnihotra certain
materials, such as milk and so on, are exclusively prescribed. Now, as
through the term 'agnihotra' (which the text applies to the offering to
the prâ*n*as) all the particulars belonging to the fundamental agnihotra
are already established for the secondary agnihotra also (viz. the
oblation made to the prâ*n*as), just as in the case of the ayana of the
Ku*nd*apâyins <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_157.md); the clause, 'the
first food which comes,' &c., is meant to enjoin, for the
prâ*n*âgnihotra, some particular secondary matter, viz. the circumstance
of food constituting the material of the oblation <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_158.md). Hence, considering the Mîmâ*m*sâ
principle that the omission of a secondary matter does not involve the
omission of the principal matter, we conclude that even in the case of
the omission of eating, the agnihotra offered to the prâ*n*as has to be
performed by means of water or some other not altogether unsuitable
material, according to the Mîmâ*m*sâ principle that in the absence of
the prescribed material some other suitable material may be substituted.

To this pûrvapaksha the next Sûtra replies.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_157"></span>[250:1](sbe38183.htm#fr_157.md) For one of the
great sacrifices lasting a whole year--called the ayana of the
Ku*nd*apâyins--the texts enjoin the offering of the 'agnihotra' during a
full month (cp. e.g. "Tâ*nd*ya Mahâbrâhma*n*a XXV, 4). Now from the term
'agnihotra' we conclude that all the details of the ordinary agnihotra
are valid for the agnihotra of the ayana also.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[250:2](sbe38183.htm#fr_158.md) Whereby the
materials offered in the ordinary agnihotra are superseded.
