51\. On account of the unseen principle being non-limitative.

While there are many souls, all-pervading like ether, and in equal
proximity to all bodies from within as well as without, the so-called
unseen principle (ad*ri*sh*t*a), which is of the nature of religious
merit or demerit, is acquired through mind, speech, and body (i.e.
thoughts, words, and actions).--Now, according to the Sâṅkhyas, that
principle inheres not in the Self, but abides in the pradhâna and
cannot, on account of the pradhâna being the same (for all souls), be
the limitative cause of the enjoyment of pleasure and pain for each
individual Self.--And according to the Kâ*n*âdas also the unseen
principle is due to the non-particular conjunction of the Selfs with the
internal

organs, and as thus there is no limitative reason for any particular
ad*ri*sh*t*a belonging to any particular soul, the doctrine is open to
the same objection.--Well, but there are at work in every particular
Self resolutions, &c., such as, 'I wish to obtain that result,' 'I wish
to avoid that other result,' 'I am striving for that purpose,' 'I wish
to act in that way,' &c. &c., and these may, we assume, define the
relation of ownership in which particular Selfs stand to particular
ad*ri*sh*t*as.--This objection is negatived in the following Sûtra.
