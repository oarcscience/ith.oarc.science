*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

23\. There is no contradiction, as in the case of sandal-ointment.

Just as a drop of sandal-ointment, although in actual contact with one
spot of the body only, yet produces a refreshing sensation extending
over the whole body; so the soul, although abiding in one point of the
body only, may be the cause of a perception extending over the entire
body. And as the soul is connected with the skin (which is the seat of
feeling), the assumption that the soul's sensations should extend over
the whole body is by no means contrary to reason. For the connexion of
the soul and the skin abides in the entire skin, and the skin extends
over the whole body.
