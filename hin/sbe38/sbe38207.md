*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

64\. And because the text states a quality (of the vidyâ) to be common
(to the three Vedas).

The text states that the syllable Om which is a quality,

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

i.e. the abode of a meditation, is common to the three Vedas, 'By that
syllable the threefold knowledge proceeds. With Om the Adhvaryu gives
orders, with Om the Hot*ri* recites, with Om the Udgât*ri* sings.' This
suggests that, as the abode of the vidyâ (viz. the O*m*kâra) is common,
the vidyâs which abide in it are common also.--Or else the Sûtra may be
explained as follows. If the udgîtha and so on, which are matters
qualifying the sacrificial action, were not all of them common to all
sacrificial performances, the vidyâs resting on them would not go
together. But the scriptural passages which teach the sacrificial
performances and extend over all subordinate matters, state that the
udgîtha and so on are common to all performances. As thus the abodes of
the vidyâs go together, the vidyâs abiding in them go together likewise.
