18\. (The soul after having passed forth from the body) follows the
rays.

There is the vidyâ of him within the heart, which begins, 'There is this
city of Brahman and in it the palace, the small lotus, and in it that
small ether' (*Kh*. Up. VIII, 1, 1). A subsequent section of that
chapter--beginning with the words, 'Now these veins of the
heart'--describes at length the connexion of the veins and the rays, and
the text then continues, 'When he departs from this body, he departs
upwards by those very rays,' and further on, 'By that

moving upwards he reaches immortality.' From this we understand that the
soul passing out by the hundred and first vein follows the rays.--A
doubt here arises as to whether the soul of him who dies by night as
well as of him who dies by day follows the rays, or the soul of the
latter only.--Since scripture mentions no difference, the Sûtra teaches
that the souls follow the rays in both cases.
