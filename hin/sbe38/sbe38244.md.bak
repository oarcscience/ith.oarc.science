35\. And scripture also declares that (those performing works) are not
overpowered (by passion and the like).

This Sûtra points out a further indicatory mark fortifying the
conclusion that works co-operate towards knowledge. Scripture also shows
that he who is furnished with such means as Brahma*k*arya, &c., is not
overpowered by such afflictions as passion and the like. Compare the
passage, 'That Self does not perish which they find out by
Brahma*k*arya' (*Kh*. Up. VIII,,";, 3).--It is thus a settled conclusion
that sacrifices and so on are works incumbent on the â*s*ramas as well
as co-operative towards knowledge.
