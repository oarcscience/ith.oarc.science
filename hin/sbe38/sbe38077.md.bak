# THIRD ADHYÂYA

### FIRST PÂDA

REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!

1\. In obtaining a different (body) (the soul) goes enveloped (by subtle
parts of the elements), (as appears from) question and explanation.

In the second adhyâya we have refuted the objections raised against the
Vedântic of Brahman on the ground of Sm*ri*ti and reasoning; we have
shown that all other opinions are devoid of foundation, and that the
alleged mutual contradictions of Vedic texts do not exist. Further we
have demonstrated that the entities different from--but subordinate
to--the individual soul (such as prâ*n*a, &c.) spring from Brahman.--Now
in the third adhyâya we shall discuss the following subjects: the manner
in which the soul together with its subordinate adjuncts passes through
the sa*m*sâra (III, 1); the different states of the soul and the nature
of Brahman (III, 2); the separateness or non-separateness of the vidyâs
and the question whether the qualities (of Brahman) have to be cumulated
or not (III, 3); the accomplishment of man's highest end by means of
perfect knowledge (sa*m*yagdar*s*ana), the different injunctions as to
the means of perfect knowledge and the absence of certain rules as to
release which is the fruit (of perfect knowledge <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64)) (III, 4.md). As occasion leads some other
matters also will be explained.--The first pâda explains, on the ground
of the so-called vidyâ of the five fires (*Kh*. Up. V, 3-10), the
different modes of the soul's passing through the sa*m*sâra; the reason
of that doctrine being (the inculcation of) absence

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

of all desire (vairâgya), in accordance with the scriptural remark at
the end (of the vidyâ), 'hence let a man take care to himself.'--The
soul accompanied by the chief vital air, the sense-organs and the mind,
and taking with itself nescience (avidyâ), moral good or ill-desert
(karman), and the impressions left by its previous existences <span
id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md), leaves its former body and obtains a new
body; this is known from the scriptural passage extending from B*ri*.
Up. IV, 4, 1 ('Then those prâ*n*as gather around him') up to IV, 4, 4
('It makes to itself another newer and more beautiful shape'); which
passage forms part of a chapter treating of the sa*m*sâra-state. And it
moreover follows from the possibility (thus resulting) of the soul
enjoying the fruits of good and evil actions.--Here the question arises
whether the soul when going to the new body is enveloped or not by
subtle parts of the elements constituting the seeds of the body.--It is
not so enveloped, the pûrvapakshin.--Why?--Because scripture, while
stating that the soul takes the organs with itself, does not state the
same with regard to the elements. For the expression 'those parts of
light' (te*g*omâtrâ*h*) occurs in the passage 'He taking with him those
parts of light,' &c., intimates that the organs only are taken (and not
the elements), since in the complementary portion of the passage the
eye, &c., are spoken of, and not the subtle parts of the elements. The
subtle parts of the elements can moreover easily be procured anywhere;
for wherever a new body is to be originated they are present, and the
soul's taking them with itself would, therefore, be useless. Hence we
conclude that the soul when going is not enveloped by them.

To this the teacher replies, 'in obtaining another it goes enveloped.'
That means: we must understand that the soul when passing from one body
to another is enveloped by the subtle parts of the elements which are
the seeds of the new

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

body.--How do we know this?--'From the question and the explanation.'
The question is, 'Do you know why in the fifth libation water is called
man?' (V, 3, 3.) The explanation, i.e. answer, is given in the entire
passage which, after having explained how the five libations in the form
of *s*raddhâ, rain, food, seed are offered in the five fires, viz. the
heavenly world, Par*g*anya, the earth, man and woman, concludes, 'For
this reason is water in the fifth oblation called man.' Hence we
understand that the soul goes enveloped by water.--But--an objection
will be raised--another scriptural passage declares that like a
caterpillar the soul does not abandon the old body before it makes an
approach to another body <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md). (B*ri*.
Up. IV, 4, 3, 'And as a caterpillar.')--We reply that what there is
compared to the (action of the) caterpillar is (not the non-abandonment
of the old body but) merely the lengthening out of the creative effort
whose object is the new body to be obtained, which (new body) is
presented by the karman of the soul <span
id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_67.md)*H*ence there is no contradiction.--As the
mode of obtaining a new body is thus declared by *S*ruti, all hypotheses
which owe their origin to the mind of man only are to be set aside
because they are contradicted by scripture. So e.g. the opinion (of the
Sâṅkhyas) that the Self and the organs are both all--pervading <span
id="fr_68"></span>[3](#fn_68.md), and when obtaining a new body only begin
to function in it in consequence of the karman; or the opinion (of the
Bauddhas) that the Self alone

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

(without the organs) begins to function in a new body, and that as the
body itself, so new sense-organs also are produced in the new abode of
fruition <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md); or the opinion (of the
Vai*s*eshikas) that the mind only proceeds to the new abode of
fruition <span id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70.md); or the opinion (of the
Digambara *G*ainas) that the individual soul only flying away from the
old body alights in the new one as a parrot flies from one tree to
another.--But--an objection will be raised--from the quoted question and
answer it follows that the soul goes enveloped by water only, according
to the meaning of the word made use of by scripture, viz. water. How
then can the general statement be maintained that the soul goes
enveloped by subtle parts of all elements?--To this doubt the next Sûtra
replies.
