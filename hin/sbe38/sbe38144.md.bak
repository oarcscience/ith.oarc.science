### THIRD PÂDA.

REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!

1\. (The cognitions) intimated by all the Vedânta-texts (are identical),
on account of the non-difference of injunction and so on.

In the preceding part of this work we have explained the nature of the
object of cognition, i.e. Brahman. We now enter on the discussion of the
question whether the cognitions of Brahman, which form the subject of
the different Vedânta-texts, are separate cognitions or not.

But, an objection may here be raised, so far we have determined that
Brahman is free from all distinctions whatever, one, of absolutely
uniform nature like a lump of salt; hence there appears to be no reason
for even raising the question whether the cognitions of Brahman are
separate cognitions or constitute only one cognition. For as Brahman is
one and of uniform nature, it certainly cannot be maintained that the
Vedânta-texts aim at establishing a plurality in Brahman comparable to
the plurality of works (inculcated by the karmakâ*nd*a of the Veda). Nor
can it be said that although Brahman is uniform, yet it may be the
object of divers cognitions; for any difference in nature between the
cognition and the object known points to a mistake committed. If, on the
other hand, it should be assumed that the different Vedânta-texts aim at
teaching different cognitions of Brahman, it would follow that only one
cognition can be the right one while all others are mistaken, and that
would lead to a general distrust of all Vedânta.--Hence the question
whether each individual Vedânta-text teaches a separate cognition of
Brahman or not cannot even be raised.--Nor, supposing that question were
raised after all, can the non-difference of the cognition of Brahman be
demonstrated (as the Sûtra attempts) on the ground that all
Vedânta-texts are equally injunctions, since the cognition of Brahman is
not of the nature of an injunction. For the teacher has proved at

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

length (I, 1, 4) that the knowledge of Brahman is produced by passages
which treat of Brahman as an existing accomplished thing and thus do not
aim at enjoining anything.--Why then begin at all this discussion about
the difference or non-difference of the cognitions of Brahman?

To all this we reply that no objection can be raised against a
discussion of that kind, since the latter has for its object only the
qualified Brahman and prâ*n*a and the like. For devout meditations on
the qualified Brahman may, like acts, be either identical or different.
Scripture moreover teaches that, like acts, they have various results;
some of them have visible results, others unseen results, and others
again--as conducive to the springing up of perfect knowledge--have for
their result release by successive steps. With a view to those
meditations, therefore, we may raise the question whether the individual
Vedânta-texts teach different cognitions of Brahman or not.

The arguments which may here be set forth by the pûrvapakshin are as
follows. In the first place it is known that difference may be proved by
names, as e.g. in the case of the sacrificial performance called 'light'
(*g*yotis) <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md). And the cognitions of
Brahman which are enjoined in the different Vedânta-texts are connected
with different names such as the Taittirîyaka, the Vâ*g*asaneyaka, the
Kauthumaka, the Kaushîtaka, the *S*â*t*yâyanaka, &c.--In the second
place the separateness of actions is proved by the difference of form
(characteristics; rûpa). So e.g. with reference to the passage, 'the
milk is for the Vi*s*vedevas, the water for the vâ*g*ins.'  <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md)

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

Now similar differences of form are met with in the Vedânta-texts; the
followers of one *S*âkhâ, e.g. mention, in the chapter called 'the
knowledge of the five fires,' a sixth fire, while other *S*âkhâs mention
five only; and in the colloquy of the prâ*n*as some texts mention a
lesser, others a greater number of organs and powers of the body.--In
the third place differences in qualifying particulars (dharma) are
supposed to prove difference of acts, and such differences also are met
with in the Vedanta-texts; only in the Mu*nd*aka-Upanishad. e.g. it is
said that the science of Brahman must be imparted to those only who have
performed the rite of carrying fire on the head (Mu. Up. III, 2,
10).--In the same way the other reasons which are admitted to prove the
separateness of actions, such as repetition and so on, are to be applied
in a suitable manner to the different Vedânta-texts also.--We therefore
maintain that each separate Vedânta-text teaches a different cognition
of Brahman.

To this argumentation of the pûrvapakshin we make the following
reply.--The cognitions enjoined by all the Vedânta-texts are the same,
owing to the non-difference of injunction and so on. The 'and so on'
refers to the other reasons proving non-difference of acts which are
enumerated in the Siddhânta-sûtra of the adhikara*n*a treating of the
different *S*âkhâs (Pû. Mî. II, 4, 9, '(the act) is one on account of
the non-difference of connexion of form, of injunction, and of name').
Thus, as the agnihotra though described in different *S*âkhâs is yet
one, the same kind of human activity being enjoined in all by means of
the words, 'He is to offer;' so the injunction met with in the text of
the Vâ*g*asaneyins (B*ri*. Up. VI, 1, 1), 'He who knows the oldest and
the best,' &c., is the same as that which occurs in the text of the
*Kh*andogas, 'He who knows the first and the best' (*Kh*. Up. V, 1, 1).
The connexion of the meditation enjoined with its aim is likewise the
same in both texts, 'He becomes the first and best among his people.' In
both texts again the cognition enjoined has the same form. For in both
the object of knowledge is the true nature of the prâ*n*a which is
characterised by

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

certain qualities such as being the first and best, and just as the
material and the divinity constitute the form of the sacrifice, so the
object known constitutes the form of the cognition. And finally both
cognitions have the same name, viz. the knowledge of the prâ*n*a.--For
these reasons we declare that the different Vedânta-texts enjoin
identical cognitions.--A similar line of reasoning applies to other
cognitions which are met with in more than one Vedânta-text, so e.g. to
the knowledge of the five fires, the knowledge of Vai*s*vânara, the
knowledge of Sâ*nd*ilya. and so on.--Of the apparent reasons on the
ground of which the pûrvapakshin above tried to show that the
meditations are not identical but separate a refutation is to be found
in the Pûrvâ Mîmâ*m*sâ-sûtras II, 4, 10 ff.

The next Sûtra disposes of a doubt which may remain even after the
preceding discussion.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[185:1](sbe38144.htm#fr_123.md) See the
sa*mgñ*âk*ri*takarmabhedâdhikara*n*a, Pû. Mî. Sû. II, 2, 22, where the
decision is that the word *g*yotis (in 'athaisha *g*yotir' &c.) denotes
not the *g*yotish*t*oma but a separate sacrificial performance.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[185:2](sbe38144.htm#fr_124.md) See Pû. Mî. Sû.
II, 2, 23. The offering of water made to the divinities called vâ*g*in
is separate from the offering of milk to the Vi*s*vedevas; for the
material offered as well as the divinity to which the offering is made
(i.e. the two rûpa of the sacrifice) differs in the two cases.
