21\. Or this is not so, on account of the difference (of place).

The two secret names do not apply quite equally to the two persons
mentioned, because they are connected with different places in the
vidyâ. For the clause, 'Its secret name is ahar,' the text exhibits in
connexion with the person in the solar orb, while the clause, 'Its
secret name is aham,' occurs in connexion with the person in the eye.
Now the pronoun 'its' always refers to something mentioned close by; we
therefore conclude that the text teaches each secret name as belonging
to one special abode of Brahman only. How then can both names be valid
for both?--But, an objection is raised, the person within the orb of the
sun and the person within the eye are one only; for the text teaches
them both to be abodes of the one true Brahman!--True, we reply; but as
each secret name is taught only with reference to the one Brahman as
conditioned by a particular state, the name applies to Brahman only in
so far as it is in that state. We on our part also illustrate the case
by a comparison. The teacher always remains the teacher; yet those kinds
of services which the pupil has to do to the teacher when sitting have
not to be

done when he stands; and vice versa.--The comparison, on the other hand,
instituted by the pûrvapakshin is ill chosen, since the duties of the
disciple towards his teacher depend on the latter's character as
teacher, and that is not changed by his being either in the village or
the forest.--Hence the two secret names have to be held apart.
