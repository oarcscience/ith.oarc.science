vidyâs) in one coherent whole.

And as thus the stories do not subserve the pâriplava it

is appropriate to assume that they are meant to bring nearer to our
understanding the approximate vidyâs with which they are seen to form
connected wholes; for they serve to render the latter more acceptable
and facilitate their comprehension.

In the Maitreyî-brâhma*n*a we see that the story forms a whole with the
vidyâ beginning, 'The Self indeed is to be seen,' &c.; in the account of
Pratardana with the vidyâ, 'I am prâ*n*a, the conscious Self;' in the
legend of *G*âna*s*ruti with the vidyâ, 'Air indeed is the end of all.'
The case of all these stories is analogous to that of stories met with
in scriptural texts referring to works, whose purpose is the
glorification of injunctions standing in proximity; as e.g. 'He cut out
his own omentum.'--The stories under discussion therefore do not
subserve the pâriplava.
