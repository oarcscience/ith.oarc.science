*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

38\. For the True and so on are one and the same (vidyâ).

The text of the Vâ*g*asaneyaka, after having enjoined the knowledge of
the True, together with a meditation on the syllables of its name
('Whosoever knows this great glorious first-born as the true Brahman,'
&c., B*ri*. Up. V, 4, 1), continues, 'Now what is the True, that is the
Âditya, the person that dwells in yonder orb, and the person in the
right eye' (V, 5, 2).--The doubt here arises whether the text enjoins
two vidyâs of the True or one only.

Two, the pûrvapakshin maintains. For the text declares two different
results, one in the earlier passage, 'He conquers these worlds' (V, 4,
1); the other one later on. 'He destroys evil and leaves it' (V, 5, 3).
And what our opponent may call a reference to the subject-matter under
discussion, <span id="fr_154"></span>[1](#fn_154.md) is merely due to the
circumstance of the object of meditation being the same (in the two
vidyâs).

To this we make the following reply.--There is only one vidyâ of the
True, because the clause, 'That which is the True,' &c., refers back to
that True which is treated

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

of in V, 4.--But has not the pûrvapakshin shown that the clause alluded
to can be accounted for even on the supposition of there being two
vidyâs?--The reasoning of the pûrvapakshin, we reply, would be
admissible only if the separateness of the two vidyâs were established
by some other clear and undoubted reason; in our ease, however, there is
a general possibility of both (viz. of the vidyâs being separate or
not), and the very circumstance that the mentioned clause contains a
back reference to the True spoken of in V, 4, determines us to conclude
that there is only one vidyâ of the True.--To the remark that there must
be two vidyâs because the text states two different results, we reply
that the statement of a second result merely has the purpose of
glorifying the new instruction given about the True, viz. that its
secret names are ahar and aham. Moreover, as in the case under
discussion, the fruit of the vidyâ has really to be supplied from its
arthavâda part <span id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md), and as there is
unity of vidyâ, all those fruits which the text states in connexion with
the single parts of the vidyâ are to be combined and put in connexion
with the vidyâ taken as a whole.--The conclusion therefore is that the
text records only one vidyâ of the True, distinguished by such and such
details, and that hence all the qualities mentioned, such as Truth and
so on, are to be comprehended in one act of meditation.

Some commentators are of opinion that the above Sûtra refers (not to the
question whether B*ri*. Up. V, 4 and V, 5 constitute one vidyâ but) to
the question whether the Vâ*g*asaneyaka-passage about the persons in the
sun and in the eye, and the similar *Kh*ândogya-passage (I, 6, 6, 'Now
that golden person who is seen within the sun,' &c.) form one vidyâ or
not. They conclude that they do so, and that hence truth and the other
qualities mentioned in

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

the Vâ*g*asaneyaka are to be combined with the *Kh*ândogya-text
also.--But this interpretation of the Sûtra appears objectionable. For
the *Kh*ândogya-vidyâ refers to the udgîtha and is thus connected with
sacrificial acts, marks of which connexion are exhibited in the
beginning, the middle, and the end of the vidyâ. Thus we read at the
beginning, 'The *Rik* is the earth, the Sâman is fire;' in the middle,
'*Rik* and Sâman are his joints and therefore he is udgîtha;' and in the
end, 'He who knowing this sings a Sâman' (*Kh*. Up. I, 6, 1; 8; I, 7,
7). In the Vâ*g*asaneyaka, on the other hand, there is nothing to
connect the vidyâ with sacrificial acts. As therefore the subject-matter
is different, the vidyâs are separate and the details of the two are to
be held apart.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[245:1](sbe38181.htm#fr_154.md) Viz. the clause in
V, 5, 2, 'That which is the true,' which apparently--or really--connects
the vidyâ of V, 5 with that of V, 4.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[246:1](sbe38181.htm#fr_155.md) For the vidyâ
contains no explicit statement that a man desirous of such and such a
fruit is to meditate on the True in such and such a way.--That in cases
where the fruit is not stated in a vidhi-passage it must be supplied
from the arthavâda-passages, is taught in the Pû. Mî. Sû. IV, 3, eighth
adhikara*n*a.
