3\. Beyond lightning (there is) Varu*n*a, on account of the connexion
(of the two).

The *Kh*ândogya continues, 'From Âditya to the moon, from the moon to
lightning.' Here Varu*n*a (mentioned in the Kaushîtaki-upan.) has to be
brought in so that above that lightning he goes to the world of
Varu*n*a. For there is a connexion between lightning and Varu*n*a; the
broad lightnings dance forth from the womb of the clouds with the sound
of deep thunder, and then water falls down. And a Brâhma*n*a also says,
'It lightens, it thunders, it will rain' (*Kh*. Up. VII, 11, 1). But the
lord of all water is Varu*n*a, as known from *S*ruti and Sm*ri*ti.--And
above Varu*n*a there come Indra and Pra*g*âpati, as there is no other
place for them, and according to the force of the text, as it stands.
Varu*n*a and so on should be inserted at the end, for that reason also
that they are merely additional, no particular place being assigned to
them. And lightning is the end of the road beginning with light <span
