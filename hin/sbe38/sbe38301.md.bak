21\. (These details) are recorded by Sm*ri*ti with reference to the
Yogins; and both (Sâṅkhya and Yoga) are Sm*ri*ti (only).

The rules as to dying by day and so on in order not to return are given
by Sm*ri*ti for the Yogins only. And those two, viz. Yoga and Sâṅkhya
are mere Sm*ri*ti, not of scriptural character. As thus it has a
different sphere of application and is based on a special kind of
authority, the Sm*ri*ti rule as to the time of dying has no influence on
knowledge based on scripture.--But, an objection is raised, we have such
passages as the following one, 'Fire, light, the day, the light half of
the month, the six months of the northern progress; smoke, night, the
dark half of the month, the six months of the southern progress' (Bha.
Gîtâ VIII, 24; 25); in which though belonging to Sm*ri*ti we recognise
the path of the gods and the path of the fathers just as determined by
scripture!--Our refutation, we reply, of the claims of Sm*ri*ti applies
only to the contradiction which may arise from the teaching of Sm*ri*ti
regarding the legitimate time of dying. 'I will tell you the time,' &c.
In so far as Sm*ri*ti also mentions Agni and the other divinities which
lead on the departed soul, there is no contradiction whatever.
