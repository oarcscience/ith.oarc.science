33\. And through the co-operativeness (of the works towards the
origination of knowledge).

Those works are also co-operative with knowledge just because they are
enjoined as such, viz. in passages such as 'Him the Brâhma*n*as seek to
know by the study of the Veda,' &c. This has been explained under Sûtra
26. Nor must you think that the texts stating the co-operation of the
works of the â*s*ramas towards knowledge refer to the fruit of
knowledge, as e.g. the offerings called prayâ*g*as co-operate towards
the fruit of the dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa of which they are auxiliary members;
for knowledge is not characterised by injunction, and the fruit of
knowledge is not to be effected by means. Means characterised by
injunctions such as the dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa-sacrifice which aim at
bringing about certain fruits such as the heavenly would require other
(subordinate) means co-operating towards the fruit (such as the
prayâ*g*as). But not so knowledge. Compare on this point Sûtra 25.
Therefore texts stating the cooperation of works (with knowledge) have
to be interpreted as stating that works are means for the origination of
knowledge.--Nor need we fear that thus there arises a contradiction of
permanent and non-permanent connexion. For there may be difference of
connexion even where there is no difference of work. One connexion is
permanent, resting on the texts about the life-long performance of the
agnihotra and so on; of this knowledge is not the result. The other
connexion is non-permanent, resting on texts such as 'Him the
Brâhma*n*as seek to know,' &c.; of this knowledge is the result. The
case is analogous to that of the one khadira, which through a permanent
connexion serves the purpose of the sacrifice, and through a
non-permanent connexion the purpose of man.
