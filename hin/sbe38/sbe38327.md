*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

11\. The presence (of a body and senses) *G*aimini (asserts); because
the text records option (of the released person multiplying himself).

The teacher *G*aimini is of opinion that the released person possesses a
body and sense-organs as well as a mind. For passages like 'He is
onefold, he is threefold' (*Kh*. Up. VII, 26, 2) declare that the Self
has the option of manifold existence which cannot be brought about
without manifoldness of body.--The capability of optionally multiplying
one's self is, indeed, mentioned in the knowledge of plenitude (bhûman)
which refers to Brahman as devoid of qualities, but this lordly power
which is valid only for the qualified state is there mentioned only in
order to glorify the knowledge of the (unqualified) plenitude; and it
therefore presents itself as constituting the fruit of qualified
knowledge <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_233).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_233"></span>[412:1](sbe38327.htm#fr_233) Manifoldness of
the Self is mentioned in a vidyâ referring to the highest Brahman; but
its introduction there is not due to the wish of teaching something
about that state, but merely of, rhetorically, glorifying it. We,
therefore, are entitled to view that passage as teaching something about
him who possesses the lower knowledge.
