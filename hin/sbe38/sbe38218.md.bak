9\. But the declarations (of scripture) are equal (on the other side).

In reply to the averment made in Sûtra 3, we point out that there are
declarations of scripture, of equal weight, in favour of the view that
knowledge is not complementary to action. For there are scriptural
passages such as, 'Knowing this the *ri*shis descended from Kavasha
said: For what purpose should we study the Veda? for what purpose should
we sacrifice? Knowing this indeed the Ancient ones did not offer the
Agnihotra;' and 'When Brâhma*n*as know that Self and have risen above
the desire for sons, wealth, and worlds, they wander about as
mendicants' (B*ri*. Up. III, 5). Scripture moreover shows that

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yâ*gñ*avalkya and
others who knew Brahman did not take their stand on works. 'Thus far
goes immortality. Having said so Yâ*gñ*avalkya went away into the
forest' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 5, 15). With reference to the indicatory sign
(as to the dependence of knowledge to work) which is implied in the
passage, 'Sirs, I am going to perform a sacrifice,' we remark that it
belongs to a section which treats of Vai*s*vânara. Now, the text may
declare that a vidyâ of Brahman as limited by adjuncts is accompanied by
works; but all the same the vidyâ does not stand in a subordinate
relation to works since 'leading subject-matter' and the other means of
proof are absent.

We now reply to the averment made in Sûtra 4.
