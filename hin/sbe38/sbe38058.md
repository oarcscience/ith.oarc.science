4\. Because speech is preceded by that (viz. fire and the other
elements).

Although in the chapter, 'That sent forth fire,' &c., the origin of the
prâ*n*as is not mentioned, the origin of the three elements, fire,
water, and earth only being stated, nevertheless, the fact of the text
declaring that speech, prâ*n*a, and mind presuppose fire, water, and
earth--which in their turn have Brahman for their causal
substance--proves that they--and, by parity of reasoning, all
prâ*n*as--have sprung from Brahman. That speech, prâ*n*a, and mind
presuppose fire, water, and earth is told in the same chapter, 'For
truly, my child, mind consists of earth, breath of water,

speech of fire' (*Kh*. Up. VI, 5, 4). If their consisting of earth and
so on is taken literally, it follows at once that they have sprung from
Brahman. And if it be taken in a metaphorical sense only, yet, as the
sentence forms part of the chapter which treats of the evolution of
names and forms effected by Brahman; and as the introductory phrase
runs, 'That by which we hear what is not heard' (*Kh*. Up. VI, 1, 3);
and as the concluding passage is 'In it all that exists has its Self'
(*Kh*. Up. VI, 8, 7); and as the matter is moreover known from other
scriptural passages; we understand that also the statement about mind
and so on consisting of earth, &c., is meant to teach that they are
products of Brahman.--It is therefore an established conclusion that the
prâ*n*as also are effects of Brahman.
