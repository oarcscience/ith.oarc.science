34\. In any case the same (duties have to be performed) on account of
the twofold indicatory marks.

In any case, i.e. whether viewed as duties incumbent on the â*s*ramas or
as co-operating with knowledge, the very same agnihotra and other duties
have to be performed.--What, it may be asked, does the teacher wish to
preclude by the emphatic expression 'the very same?'--The suspicion, we
reply, that those works might be separate works <span
id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_199.md). In the ayana of the Ku*nd*apâyins
indeed the injunctive statement,' They offer the agnihotra for a
month <span id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_200.md),' enjoins a sacrifice
different from the permanent (ordinary) agnihotra; but in our present
case there is no analogous separation of works.--Why?--On account of the
twofold indicatory mark; i.e. on account of both scripture and Sm*ri*ti
supplying indicatory marks. In the first place, the scriptural passage,
'Him the Brâhma*n*as seek to know through the study of the Veda,' &c.,
directs that sacrifices and the like--as things already established and
the form of which is already in existence (viz. through previous
injunctions)--are to be employed as means in the search for knowledge;
and does not originate a new form of those works, while the passage
quoted above, 'They offer the agnihotra for a month,' does originate a
new separate sacrifice.--In the second place the Sm*ri*ti-passage, 'He
who performs the work to be done without aiming at the fruit of the
work,' shows that the very same work which is already known as something
to be performed subserves the origination of knowledge. Moreover the
Sm*ri*ti-passage, 'He who is qualified by those forty-eight
purifications,' &c., refers to the purifications required for Vedic
works, with a view to the origination of knowledge in him who has
undergone those purifications.--The Sûtrakâra therefore rightly
emphasizes the non-difference of the works.

referred to in the Upanishads as means of knowledge, might be works
altogether different from those enjoined in the karmakâ*nd*a as means of
bringing about certain special results such as the heavenly world.
