17\. With the exception of world-business (the released possess all
lordly power), (the Lord) being the topic (where world-business is
referred to), and (the souls) not being near (to such business).

The following doubt here presents itself. Do those who through
meditations on the qualified Brahman enter, together with their manas,
into a condition of equality with the Lord, possess unlimited lordly
power, or power limited to some extent?--The pûrvapakshin maintains that
their power must be unlimited, because we meet with texts such as 'He
obtains Self-lordship' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 6, 2); 'All the gods bring an
offering for him' (Taitt. Sa*m*h. I, 5, 3); 'For them there is freedom
in all worlds' (*Kh*. Up. VIII, 1, 6)--To this the Sûtra replies,
'Excepting the world-business.' With the exception of the origination
and so on of the world all other lordly powers, as e.g. rendering one's
self of atomic size, must belong to the released. The world-business, on
the other hand, can belong to the everlastingly

perfect Lord only.--Why so?--Because there (where the origination and so
on of the world are referred to) the Lord forms the general topic, and
because the other (souls) do not stand near (to the world-business). The
highest Lord only is appointed to do all work referring to the entire
world; for the world's origination and so on are taught only where he
constitutes the general subject-matter, and moreover he (only) is
eternal, and described in scripture (as the creator, &c. of the
world) <span id="fr_236"></span>[1](sbe38334.htm#fn_236). The lordly
power of the other souls, on the contrary, scripture shows to have a
beginning, because it depends on their searching for and striving to
know the Lord. They are therefore remote from all world-business. And
just because they have minds, they might be of different minds, and one
might have the intention of preserving the world while another might
wish to destroy it. Such conflicts can only be avoided by assuming that
the wishes of one should conform to those of another, and from this it
follows that all other souls (but the Lord) depend on the highest Lord.
