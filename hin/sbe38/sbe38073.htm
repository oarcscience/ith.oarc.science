<p>19. And on account of the difference of characteristics.</p>  
<p>There is moreover a difference of characteristics between the chief pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a and the other pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as. When speech &amp;c. are asleep, the chief pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a alone is awake. The chief pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a alone is not reached by death, while the other pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as are. The staying and departing of the chief pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a--not that of the sense-organs--is the cause of the maintenance and the destruction of the body. The sense-organs, on the other hand, are the cause of the perception of the sense-objects, not the chief pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a. Thus there are manifold differences distinguishing the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a from the senses, and this also shows the latter to be different in being from the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a--To infer from the passage, 'thereupon they all assumed his form,' that the sense-organs are nothing but pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is wrong, because there also an examination of the context makes us understand their difference. For there the sense-organs are enumerated first ('Voice held, I shall speak,' &amp;c.); after that it is said that speech, &amp;c. were seized by death in the form of weariness ('Death having become weariness held them back; therefore speech grows weary'); finally pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is mentioned separately as not having been overcome by death ('but death did not seize the central breath'), and is</p>

<p>asserted to be the best ('he is the best of us'). The assuming of the form of pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a has therefore, in accordance with the quoted passages, to be understood to mean that the energizing of speech and so on depends on the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, but not that they are identical with it.--Hence it follows that the word 'pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is applied to the sense-organs in a secondary sense. Thus <I>S</I>ruti also says, 'Thereupon they all assumed his form, and therefore they are called after him pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as;' a passage declaring that the word pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, which properly refers to the chief pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is secondarily applied to the sense-organs also. Speech and the other sense-organs are therefore different in being from the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a.</p>
