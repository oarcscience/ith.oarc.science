*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

23\. (The stories told in the Upanishads) are for the purpose of the
pâriplava; we deny this on account of (certain stories only) being
specified.

'Yâ*gñ*avalkya had two wives, Maitreyî and Kâtyâyani' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 5,
1); 'Pratardana, forsooth, the son of Divodâsa came to the beloved abode
of Indra' (Kau. Up. III, 1); 'There lived once upon a time *G*âna*s*ruti
Pautrâya*n*a, who was a pious giver, giving much and keeping open house'
(*Kh*. Up. IV, 1, 1); with regard to these and similar stories met with
in the Vedânta portions of scripture there arises a doubt whether they
are meant to subserve the performance of the pâriplava <span
id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_195), or to introduce the vidyâs standing in
proximity to them.

The pûrvapakshin maintains that those scriptural stories subserve the
pâriplava because they are stories like others, and because the telling
of stories is enjoined for the pâriplava. And from this it follows that
the Vedânta-texts do not chiefly aim at knowledge, because like mantras
they stand in a complementary relation to sacrificial performances.

This conclusion we deny 'on account of the specification.' Under the
heading 'he is to recite the pâriplava,' scripture specifies certain
definite stories such as that of 'Manu Vivasvat's son the king.' If,
now, for the reason that all tales as such are alike, all tales were
admitted for the pâriplava, the mentioned specification would be devoid
of meaning. We therefore conclude that those scriptural stories are not
meant to be told at the pâriplava.
