*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

63\. On account of the rectification.

The passage, 'From the seat of the Hot*ri* he sets right any mistake
committed in the udgîtha' (*Kh*. Up. I, 5, 5), declares that, owing to
the might of the meditation on the unity of pra*n*ava and udgîtha, the
Hot*ri* sets right any mistake he may commit in his work, by means of
the work of the Hot*ri*.

Now, as a meditation mentioned in one Veda is connected (with what is
mentioned in another Veda) in the same way as a thing mentioned in
another Veda, the above passage suggests the conclusion that all
meditations on members of sacrificial acts--in whatever Veda they may be
mentioned--have to be combined <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_179.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_179"></span>[282:1](sbe38206.htm#fr_179.md) A 'thing'
belonging to the *Ri*g-veda, viz. the pra*n*ava, is, according to the
*Kh*ândogya-passage, connected with the Sâma-veda meditation on the
udgîtha. Hence meditations also which belong to different Vedas may be
combined; for there is no difference between them and things as far as
connexion is concerned.
