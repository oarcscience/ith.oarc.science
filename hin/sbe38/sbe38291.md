11\. And to that same (subtle body) that warmth (belongs), on account of
the proof (which observation furnishes).

To that same subtle body belongs the warmth which we perceive in the
living body by means of touch. That warmth is not felt in the body after
death, while such qualities as form, colour and so on continue to be
perceived; it is on the other hand, observed as long as there is life.
From this it follows that the warmth resides in something different from
the body as ordinarily known. Scripture also says, 'He is warm if going
to live, cold if going to die.'
