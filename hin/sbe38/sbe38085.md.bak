*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

9\. Should it be objected that on account of conduct (the assumption of
a remainder is not needed), we deny this because (the scriptural
expression 'conduct') is meant to connote (the remainder); so
Kârsh*n*â*g*ini thinks.

But--an objection may be raised--the scriptural passage, which has been
quoted for the purpose of proving that the existence of a remainder of
works ('those whose conduct has been good,' &c.), declares that the
quality of the new birth depends on *k*ara*n*a, not on anu*s*aya. Now
*k*ara*n*a and anu*s*aya are different things; for *k*ara*n*a is the
same as *k*aritra, â*k*âra, *s*îla, all of which mean conduct <span
id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md), while anu*s*aya denotes work remaining
from requited work. Scripture also speaks of actions and conduct as
different things, 'According as he acts and according as he conducts
himself so will he be' (B*ri*, Up. IV, 4, 5); and 'Whatever

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

works are blameless those should be regarded, not others; whatever our
good conduct was that should be observed by thee' (Taitt. Up. I, 11, 2).
From the passage which proclaims the dependence of the quality of birth
on conduct the existence of an unrequited remainder of works cannot
therefore be proved.--This objection is without force, we reply, because
the scriptural term 'conduct' is meant to connote the remainder of the
works. This is the opinion of the teacher Kârsh*n*â*g*ini.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_93"></span>[119:1](sbe38085.htm#fr_93.md) *S*îla also means
here 'conduct' only, as we see from its being co-ordinated with
*k*ara*n*a, *k*aritra, &c.; not character.
