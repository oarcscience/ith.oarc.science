*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

47\. And the Sm*ri*tis state (that).

Vyâsa and others state in their sm*ri*tis the highest Self is not
afflicted by the pain of the individual soul, 'That highest Self is said
to be eternal, devoid of qualities, nor is it stained by the fruits of
actions any more than a lotus leaf by water. But that other Self whose
essence is action is connected with bondage and release; again and again
it is joined with the seventeenfold aggregate <span
id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md).'--On the ground of the particle 'and' (in
the Sûtra) we have to supply 'and scripture also records that.' So, for
instance, 'One of them eats the sweet fruit, the other looks on without
eating' (Mu. Up. III, 1, i), and 'The one Self within all things is
never contaminated by the misery of the world, being himself without'
(Ka. Up. II, 5, ii).

Here the pûrvapakshin raises a new objection.--If there is only one
internal Self of all beings, what room is there for permissions and
prohibitions, worldly as well as Vedic? You must not reject this
objection on the ground of your having proved that the individual soul
is a part of the Lord, and that thus injunctions and prohibitions may,
without any mutual interference, apply to the soul which is different
from the Lord. For there are other scriptural passages which teach that
the soul is not different from the Lord, and therefore not a part of
him, as, for instance, the following ones:

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

Having sent forth that he entered into it' (Taitt. Up. 11, 6); There is
no other seer but he' (B*ri*. Up. III, 7, 23); 'From death to death goes
he who perceives therein any diversity' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 19); 'Thou
art that' (*Kh*. Up. VI, 8, 7); 'I am Brahman' (B*ri*. Up. I, 4, 10).
Should you say that just from this concurrence of intimations of
difference on the one hand and non-difference on the other hand it
follows that the soul is a part of the Lord, we reply that such might be
the case if the intention of the texts were to teach difference as well
as non-difference. But the fact is that the texts aim solely at teaching
non-difference, because through the knowledge of Brahman being the
universal Self the highest end of man is obtained. About difference on
the other hand mere occasional statements (anuvâda) are made as about
something already established naturally (i.e. apart from scripture).
Moreover, we have already maintained that Brahman as not composed of
parts can have no parts. Hence it follows that the one highest Self
which is within all beings appears as individual soul, and it therefore
remains to show how injunctions and prohibitions are possible.
