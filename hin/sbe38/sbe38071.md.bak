*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

17\. They (the prâ*n*as) are senses, on account of being so designated,
with the exception of the best (the mukhya prâ*n*a).

We have treated of the mukhya prâ*n*a and the other

eleven prâ*n*as in due order.--Now there arises another doubt, viz.
whether the other prâ*n*as are functions of the mukhya prâ*n*a or
different beings.--The pûrvapakshin that they are mere functions, on
account of scriptural statement. For scripture, after having spoken of
the chief prâ*n*a and the other prâ*n*as in proximity, declares that
those other prâ*n*as have their Self in the chief prâ*n*a, 'Well, let us
all assume his form. Thereupon they all assumed his form' (B*ri*. Up. I,
5, 2l).--Their unity is moreover ascertained from the unity of the term
applied to them, viz. prâ*n*a. Otherwise there either would result the
objectionable circumstance of one word having different senses, or else
the word would in some places have to be taken in its primary sense, in
others in a derived sense. Hence, as prâ*n*a, apâna, &c. are the five
functions of the one chief prâ*n*a, so the eleven prâ*n*as also which
begin with speech are mere functions of the chief prâ*n*a.--To this we
reply as follows. Speech and so on are beings different from the chief
prâ*n*a, on account of the difference of designation.--Which is that
difference of designation?--The eleven prâ*n*as remaining if we abstract
from the best one, i.e. the chief prâ*n*a, are called the sense-organs
(indriya), as we see them designated in *S*ruti, 'from him is born
breath, mind, and all organs of sense' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3). In this and
other passages prâ*n*a and the sense-organs are mentioned
separately.--But in that case the mind also would have to be excluded
from the class of sense-organs, like the prâ*n*a; as we see that like
the latter it is separately mentioned in the passage, 'The mind and all
organs of sense.' True; but in Sm*ri*ti eleven sense-organs are
mentioned, and on that account the mind must, like the ear, and so on,
be comprised in the sense-organs. That the prâ*n*a on the other hand is
a sense-organ is known neither from Sm*ri*ti nor *S*ruti.--Now this
difference of designation is appropriate only if there is difference of
being. If there were unity of being it would be contradictory that the
prâ*n*a although one should sometimes be designated as sense--organ and
sometimes not. Consequently the other prâ*n*as are different in being
from the chief prâ*n*a.--For this conclusion the following Sûtra states
an additional reason.
