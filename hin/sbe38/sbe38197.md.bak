*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

54\. There is separation (of the Self from the

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

body) because its existence does not depend on the existence of that
(viz. the body), but there is not (non-separation); as in the case of
perceptive consciousness.

The assertion that the Self is not separate from the body cannot be
maintained. The Self rather must be something separate from the body,
'because the existence (of the Self) does not depend on the existence of
that (i.e. the body).' For if from the circumstance that they are where
the body is you conclude that the qualities of the Self are qualities of
the body, you also must conclude from the fact that they are not where
the body is that they are not qualities of the body, because thereby
they show themselves to be different in character from the qualities of
the body. Now the (real) qualities of the body, such as form and so on,
may be viewed as existing as long as the body exists; life, movement,
&c., on the other hand, do not exist even when the body exists, viz. in
the state of death. The qualities of the body, again, such as form and
so on, are perceived by others; not so the qualities of the Self, such
as consciousness, remembrance, and so on. Moreover, we can indeed
ascertain the presence of those latter qualities as long as the body
exists in the state of life, but we cannot ascertain their non-existence
when the body does not exist; for it is possible that even after this
body has died the qualities of the Self should continue to exist by
passing over into another body. The opposite opinion is thus precluded
also for the reason of its being a mere hypothesis.--We further must
question our opponent as to the nature of that consciousness which he
assumes to spring from the elements; for the materialists do not admit
the existence of anything but the four elements. Should he say that
consciousness is the perception of the elements and what springs from
the elements, we remark that in that case the elements and their
products are objects of consciousness and that hence the latter cannot
be a quality of them, as it is contradictory that anything should act on
itself. Fire is hot indeed but does not burn itself, and the acrobat,
well

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

trained as he may be, cannot mount on his own shoulders. As little could
consciousness, if it were a mere quality of the elements and their
products, render them objects of itself. For form and other (undoubted)
qualities do not make their own colour or the colour of something else
their objects; the elements and their products, on the other hand,
whether external or belonging to the Self (the organism) are rendered
objects by consciousness. Hence in the same way as we admit the
existence of that perceptive consciousness which has the material
elements and their products for its objects, we also must admit the
separateness of that consciousness from the elements. And as
consciousness constitutes the character of our Self, the Self must be
distinct from the body. That consciousness is permanent, follows from
the uniformity of its character (and we therefore may conclude that the
conscious Self is permanent also; as also follows) from the fact that
the Self, although connected with a different state, recognises itself
as the conscious agent--a recognition expressed in judgments such as 'I
saw this,'--and from the fact of remembrance and so on being
possible <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169.md).

The argumentation that consciousness is an attribute of the body because
it is where a body is, is already refuted by the reasons stated above.
Moreover, perceptive consciousness takes place where there are certain
auxiliaries such as lamps and the like, and does not take place where
those are absent, without its following therefrom that perception is an
attribute of the lamp or the like. Analogously

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

the fact that perception takes place where there is a body, and does not
take place where there is none, does not imply that it is an attribute
of the body; for like lamps and so on the body may be used (by the Self)
as a mere auxiliary. Nor is it even true that the body is absolutely
required as an auxiliary of perception; for in the state of dream we
have manifold perceptions while the body lies motionless.--The view of
the Self being something separate from the body is therefore free from
all objections.
