*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

15\. Moreover there are seven (hells).

Moreover, the purâ*n*a-writers record that there are seven hells,
Raurava, &c., by name, which serve as abodes of enjoyment of the fruits
of evil deeds. As those who do not sacrifice, &c. go there, how should
they reach the moon?--But, an objection is raised, the assertion that
evil doers suffer punishments allotted by Yama is contradicted by the
circumstance that Sm*ri*ti mentions different other beings, such as
*K*itragupta, &c., who act as superintendents in Raurava and the other
hells.--This objection the next Sûtra refutes.
