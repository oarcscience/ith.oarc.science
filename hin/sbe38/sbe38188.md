*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

45\. (The agni built of mind, &c.) is a particular form of the preceding
one (i.e. the agni built of bricks), on account of the leading
subject-matter; it is (part of) the act; as in the case of the mânasa
cup.

Your supposition, the pûrvapakshin objects, as to those fire-altars
being not supplementary to the sacrificial act,

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

but altogether independent of it, is untenable. The influence of the
leading subject-matter rather compels us to conclude that the
instruction given by the text about the agni made of mind and so on,
enjoins some particular mode of the same agni which the preceding
sections describe as the outcome of a real act <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_166.md).--But are not indicatory marks stronger
than the leading subject-matter?--True in general; but indicatory marks
such as those contained in the passages quoted above are by no means
stronger than the general subject-matter. For as those passages are of
the nature of glorifications of the fanciful fire-altars, the liṅgas
(have no proving power in themselves but) merely illustrate some other
matter (viz. the injunction to which those passages are arthavâdas); and
as they are of that nature they may, there being no other proof, be
taken as mere gu*n*avâdas, and as such are not able to sublate the
influence of the prakara*n*a. On the ground of the latter, therefore,
all those fanciful agnis must be viewed as forming parts of the
sacrificial action.

The case is analogous to that of the 'mental' (cup). On the tenth day of
the Soma sacrifices occupying twelve days--which day is termed
avivâkya--a soma cup is offered mentally, the earth being viewed as the
cup, the sea as the Soma and Pra*g*âpati as the divinity to which the
offering is made. All rites connected with that cup, viz. taking it up,
putting it down in its place, offering the liquid in it, taking up the
remaining liquid, the priests inviting one another to drink the
remainder, and the drinking, all these rites the text declares to be
mental only, i.e. to be done in thought only <span
id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_167.md). Yet this mental quasi-cup, as standing
under the heading of a sacrificial act, forms part of that act.--The
same then holds good with regard to the quasi-agnis made of mind and so
on.
