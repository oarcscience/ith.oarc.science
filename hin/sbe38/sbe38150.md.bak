7\. Or rather there is no (unity of the vidyâs), owing to the difference
of subject-matter.

Setting aside the view maintained by the pûrvapakshin, we have rather to
say that, owing to the difference "of subject-matter, the two vidyâs are
separate.--In the *Kh*ândogya the introductory sentence (I, 1, 1), 'Let
a man meditate on the syllable Om (as) the udgîtha,' represents as the
object of meditation the syllable Om which is a part of the udgîtha;
thereupon proceeds to give an account of its qualities such as being the
inmost essence of all ('The full account, however, of Om is this,' &c.);
and later on tells, with reference to the same syllable Om which is a
part of the udgîtha, a story about the Gods and Asuras in which there
occurs the statement,' They meditated on the udgîtha

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

as that breath <span id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_129.md).' If now we should
assume <span id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_130.md) that the term 'udgîtha'
denotes here the whole act of worship (not only the syllable Om which is
a part of the udgîtha), and that (in the passage, 'they meditated on the
udgîtha as that breath') the performer of that worship, i.e. the
Udgât*ri*-priest, is said to be meditated upon as breath; our
interpretation would be open to two objections: in the first place it
would be opposed to the introductory sentence (which directly declares
the syllable Om to be the object of devotion); and in the second place
it would oblige us to take the word udgîtha (in 'they meditated on the
udgîtha'), not in its direct sense, but as denoting by implication the
udgât*ri*. But the rule is that in one and the same connected passage
the interpretation of later passages has to adapt itself to the earlier
passages. We therefore conclude the passage last quoted to teach that
the syllable Om which is a part of the udgîtha is to be meditated upon
as prâ*n*a.--In the Vâ*g*asaneyaka on the other hand there is no reason
for taking the word udgîtha to denote a part of the udgîtha only, and we
therefore must interpret it to denote the whole; and in the passage, 'Do
thou sing out for us,' the performer of the worship, i.e. the
Udgât*ri*-priest, is described as prâ*n*a. In reply to the
pûrvapakshin's remark that in the Vâ*g*asaneyaka also the udgîtha and
the prâ*n*a occur in co-ordination (in the passage, 'He is udgîtha'), we
point out that that statement merely aims at showing that the Self of
all is that prâ*n*a which the text wishes to represent as udgât*ri*. The
statement, therefore, docs not imply the unity of the two vidyâs.
Moreover, there also the term udgîtha denotes the whole act of worship
(while in the *Kh*ândogya it denotes the omkâra only). Nor must it be
said that the prâ*n*a can

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

impossibly be an udgât*ri*, and that on that account our interpretation
of the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka passage is erroneous; for with a view to
pious meditation scripture may represent the prâ*n*a as udgât*ri* as
well as udgîtha. And, moreover, the Udgât*ri* actually performs his work
by the strength of his breath; hence the prâ*n*a may be called
udgât*ri*. In accordance with this the text says (I, 3, 24). 'He sang it
indeed as speech and breath.'--And if we understand that the text
clearly intends to convey a difference of matter we have no right to
conclude from merely apparent similarities of expression that only one
matter is intended to be expressed. To quote an analogous instance from
the karma-kâ*nd*a: In the section relative to the unexpected rising of
the moon during the dar*s*a-sacrifice, as well as in the section about
the offering to be made by him who is desirous of cattle, we meet with
identical injunctions such as the following one, 'He is to divide, the
grains into three portions, and to make those of medium size into a cake
offered on eight potsherds to Agni the Giver,' &c.; nevertheless it
follows from the difference of the introductory passages of the two
sections that the offerings to be made on account of the moon's rising
are indeed not connected with the divinities of the dar*s*a-sacrifice
(but do not constitute a new sacrifice separate from the dar*s*a), while
the section about him who is desirous of cattle enjoins a separate
sacrificial performance <span
id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131.md).--Analogously a difference in the nature
of the introductory clauses effects a difference of the vidyâs, 'As in
the case of that which is greater than great.' That means: Just as the
meditation on the udgîtha enjoined in the passage, 'Ether is greater
than these, ether is their rest; he is indeed the udgîtha, greater than
great, he is without end' (*Kh*. Up. I, 9, 1), and the other meditation
on the udgîtha as possessing the qualities of abiding within the eye and
the sun, &c. (*Kh*. Up. I, 6), are separate meditations, although in
both the udgîtha is identified with the highest Self; so it is with
vidyâs in general. The special features of different vidyâs are not to
be combined even when the

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

vidyâs belong to one and the same *S*âkhâ; much less then when they
belong to different *S*âkhâs.

appears that the *Kh*ândogya enjoins throughout a meditation on the
syllable Om which is only a part of the udgîtha; while the object of
meditation enjoined in the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka is the whole udgîtha.
