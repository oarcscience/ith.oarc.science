*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

4\. If it be said (that the prâ*n*as do not go) on account of the
scriptural statement as to entering into Agni, &c., we deny this on
account of the metaphorical nature (of those statements).

Well, the pûrvapaksha resumes, we deny that at the time when a new body
is obtained the prâ*n*as go with the soul, because scripture speaks of
their going to Agni, &c. For that at the time of death speech and the
other prâ*n*as go to Agni and the other gods the following passage
expressly declares: 'When the speech of the dead person

enters into the fire, breath into the air,' &c. (B*ri*. Up. III, 2.
l3).--To this we reply that the objection is of no force on account of
the metaphorical character of those statements. The entering of speech,
&c., into Agni is metaphorical, because we observe no such entering in
the case of the hairs of the head and body. For although the text says
that 'the hairs of the body enter into the shrubs and the hairs of the
head into the trees;' still we cannot understand this to mean that the
hairs actually fly away from the body and enter into trees and shrubs.
On the other hand, the soul could not go at all if we denied to it the
limiting adjunct formed by the prâ*n*as, and without the latter it could
not, in the new body, enter into the state of fruition. Besides, other
passages distinctly declare that the prâ*n*as go with the soul.--From
all this we conclude that the passage about speech, &c. entering into
Agni, metaphorically expresses that Agni and the other divinities who
act as guides of the prâ*n*as and cooperate with them stop their
cooperation at the time of death.
