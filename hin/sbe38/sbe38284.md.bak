*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

4\. That (viz. breath) (is merged) in the ruler (i.e. the individual
soul), on account of the (statements as to the prâ*n*as) coming to it
and so on.

We have ascertained that a thing which has not originated from another
is not itself merged in the latter, but only through its functions. A
doubt now arises whether, according to the word of scripture, the
function of breath is merged in heat, or in the individual soul which is
the ruler of the body and senses.--According to the pûrvapakshin we must
conclude that the breath is merged in heat only, since the scriptural
statement allows no room for doubt and we are not entitled to assume
something not declared by scripture. The breath under discussion
persists 'in the ruler,' i.e. the intelligent Self (the individual soul)
which possesses nescience, work, and former knowledge as limiting
adjuncts; i.e. the function of breath has that soul for its
substratum.--Why so?--'On account of (the prâ*n*as) going towards him,'
&c.--Another scriptural passage declares that all prâ*n*as without any
difference go to the soul, 'All the prâ*n*as go to the Self at the time
of death when a man is thus going to expire' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 3, 38).
Another passage again specially declares that the prâ*n*a with its five
functions follows the individual soul, 'After him thus departing the
prâ*n*a departs, 'and that the other prâ*n*as follow that prâ*n*a, 'And
after the prâ*n*a thus departing all the other prâ*n*as depart' (B*ri*.
Up. IV, 4, 2). And the text, 'He is furnished with intelligence'
(ibid.), by declaring the individual soul to

be of intimately intelligent nature, suggests that in it, viz. the soul,
the prâ*n*a--into which the different organs of knowledge have been
merged--has taken its abode.--But scripture also says, 'The prâ*n*a (is
merged) in heat;' why then make the addition implied in the
doctrine--that breath is merged in the individual soul?--We must make
that addition, we reply, because in the process of departure &c. the
soul is the chief agent, and because we must pay regard to
specifications contained in other scriptural passages also.--How then do
you explain the statement, 'Breath is merged in heat?'--To this question
the next Sûtra replies.
