7\. But wherever there are effects, there is division; as in ordinary
life.

The conjunction 'but' is meant to exclude the suspicion of
impossibility.--We must not imagine the origin of ether to be
impossible, because wherever we observe effects (modifications of a
substance), such as jars, pots and urns, or bracelets, armlets and
earrings, or needles, arrows and swords, we also observe division;
while, on the other hand,

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

nothing which is not an effect is seen to be divided <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md). Now, we apprehend ether as divided from
earth and so on; hence ether also must be an effect. Thereby (i.e. by
the circumstance of their being divided) place (di*s*), time, mind
(manas) and the atoms also are shown to be effects.

But--an objection may be raised--the Self also is divided from ether and
so on, and hence it follows that it is an effect like jars and the
like.--This objection we refute by pointing to the scriptural statement
that 'ether sprang from the Self (Taitt. Up. II, 1). For if the Self
also were a mere modification (of something else), it would follow that
all effects such as the ether and so on are without a Self <span
id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md); for scripture mentions nothing beyond the
Self, and that Self itself would (on the supposition stated) be a mere
effect. And thus we should be driven to the hypothesis of a general void
(*s*ûnyavâda). Just because it is the Self, it is impossible for us to
entertain the idea even of its being capable of refutation. For the
(knowledge of the) Self is not, in any person's case, adventitious, not
established through the so-called means of right knowledge; it rather is
self-established. The Self does indeed employ perception and the other
means of right knowledge for the purpose of establishing previously
non-established objects of knowledge; for nobody assumes such things as
ether and so on to be self-established independently of the means of
right knowledge. But the Self, as being the abode of the energy that
acts through the means of right knowledge, is itself established
previously to that energy. And to refute such a self-established entity
is impossible. An adventitious thing, indeed, may be refuted, but not
that which is the essential nature (of him who attempts the refutation);
for it is the essential nature of him who refutes. The heat of a fire is
not refuted (i.e. sublated) by the fire itself.--Let us further consider
the relation expressed in the following clauses: 'I know at the present
moment whatever is present; I knew (at former moments) the nearer and
the remoter past; I shall know

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

(in the future) the nearer and the remoter future.' Here the object of
knowledge changes according as it is something past or something future
or something present; but the knowing agent does not change, since his
nature is eternal presence. And as the nature of the Self is eternal
presence, it cannot undergo destruction even when the body is reduced to
ashes; nay we cannot even conceive that it ever should become something
different from what it is.--It thus follows from the essential
irrefutability of its nature that the Self is not an effect. The ether,
on the other hand, falls under the category of effected things.

To the objection, raised above by the pûrvapakshin, that there is no
plurality of homogeneous substances out of which the ether could
originate, we reply that it is not an absolute law that effects should
originate only from things belonging to the same genus, not from such as
belong to different genera. Threads for instance and the conjunctions of
threads <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) do not belong to the same
genus, the former being admitted to belong to the genus 'substance,' the
latter to the genus 'quality.' Nor again is there a binding rule that
the operative causes such as the shuttle, the loom and so on should
belong to the same genus.--Well then let the doctrine that the causes
must belong to the same genus extend to the inherent causes only, not to
the other causes <span id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md).--But here also
there is no absolute rule. For we see that one and the same rope is made
of things belonging to different genera, such as threads and cow-hair,
and several kinds of cloth are woven of vegetable thread and wool.--If
it were assumed that the postulate of the inherent causes belonging to
the same genus refers only to the genera of essentiality,
substantiality, &c., the rule would be a superfluous one; for in that
sense every inherent cause belongs to the same genus as every
other <span id="fr_12"></span>[3](#fn_12.md).

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --Nor again is
there an absolute rule that only a plurality of inherent causes, not one
such cause, is able to originate an effect. For it is admitted that an
atom as well as the mind (manas) originate their first activity; i.e.
one atom by itself, and also the mind by itself, give rise to their
primary actions, without being in conjunction with other
substances.--And, should it be said that there is an absolute rule as to
several causes only having originating power in the case of the
origination of substances only (not in the case of the origination of
actions, &c.), we again deny that, because it is admitted that there is
such a thing as change (transformation). An absolute rule, such as
maintained by you, would exist if substances did originate other
substances, only when assisted by conjunction (a non-inherent cause).
But, as a matter of fact, one and the same substance, when passing over
into a different state distinguished by peculiar characteristic marks,
is admitted to be an effect. In some cases more substances than one
undergo the change, as when a young plant springs from seed and earth;
in other cases one substance only changes, as when milk turns into
curds.--In short it is none of the Lord's laws that only several causes
in conjunction should produce an effect. We therefore decide, on the
authority of scripture, that the entire world has sprung from the one
Brahman, ether being produced first and later on the other elements in
due succession. A statement to that effect has already been made above
(II, 1, 24).

The further assertion made by the pûrvapakshin, that on the assumption
of ether having had an origin it is impossible to conceive a difference
between the former and later periods (the time before and after the
origination of ether) is likewise unfounded; for we have to understand
that that very specialising difference <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md), from which we ascertain at present that
there is a thing such as ether, different from earth and the other
elements, did not exist before the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

origination of ether. And just as Brahman's nature does not participate
in the nature of earth and the other elements characterised by grossness
and similar qualities,--according to such scriptural passages as 'It is
not gross, it is not subtle,'--so also it does not participate in the
nature of ether, as we understand from the passage 'it is without other'
(B*ri*. Up. III, 8, 8). It therefore remains a settled conclusion that,
before ether was produced, Brahman existed without ether.

The inference, drawn by the pûrvapakshin, that ether has no beginning,
because it differs in nature from those substances which avowedly have a
beginning, such as earth and so on, is without any value; for, as it is
contradicted by scripture, it must be considered fallacious. We, on our
part, have brought forward arguments showing that ether is an originated
thing; and we may moreover reason as follows: Ether is non-eternal,
because it is the substratum of a non-eternal quality, viz. sound, just
as jars and other things, which are the substrata of non-eternal
qualities, are themselves non-eternal.--Nor is there any danger of this
latter reasoning being extended to the Self also, for the philosopher
who takes his stand on the Upanishads does not admit that the Self is
the substratum of non-eternal qualities. Moreover, those who teach ether
to have an origin do not consider it proved that it is all-pervading and
so on.

In reply to the remarks made under II, 3, 4 we point out that those
scriptural passages which speak of the 'immortality of ether' are to be
understood in the same way as the analogous statements about the
immortality of the gods <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md), since the
origin and destruction of the ether have been shown to be possible. And
if it is said of Brahman that 'it is omnipresent and eternal like
ether,' Brahman is there compared to ether, whose greatness is well
known, merely in order to indicate its supereminent greatness, not in
order to maintain its being equal to ether. Similarly, when we say that
the sun moves with the speed of an

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

arrow, we merely mean that he moves fast, not that he moves at the same
rate as an arrow. This remark explains that scriptural passage also in
which Brahman is declared to be infinite like ether. On the other hand,
such passages as 'It is greater than ether' prove that the extent of
ether is less than that of Brahman; passages like 'there is no image of
him' (*S*ve. Up. IV, 19) show that there is nothing to compare Brahman
to; and passages like 'Everything else is of evil' (B*ri*. Up. III, 4,
2) show that everything different from Brahman such as ether, &c. is of
evil. All which serves to refute the assertion that the passage which
declares ether to have originated has to be taken in a secondary sense,
as the word Brahman actually has to be taken in some passages. Scripture
and reasoning in combination rather show that ether has an origin, and
the final conclusion therefore is that ether is an effect of Brahman.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_8"></span>[14:1](sbe38008.htm#fr_8.md) Whatever is divided, is
an effect, as jars, pots, &c. Whatever is not an effect, is not divided,
as the Self.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[14:2](sbe38008.htm#fr_9.md) I.e. without a material
cause.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[15:1](sbe38008.htm#fr_10.md) Threads are the
inherent cause of a piece of cloth; the conjunction of the threads
constitutes the non-inherent cause; the loom, shuttle, &c. are the
operative causes.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[15:2](sbe38008.htm#fr_11.md) So much only was in
fact insisted upon by the pûrvapakshin, II, 3.3.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[15:3](sbe38008.htm#fr_12.md) An inherent cause is
always a substance (dravya), and as such <span id="page_16">p. 16</span>
always falls under the notion of essentiality (sattâ), which constitutes
the summum genus for substances, qualities, and actions.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[16:1](sbe38008.htm#fr_13.md) Viz. the quality of
sound.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[17:1](sbe38008.htm#fr_14.md) I.e. as referring to
a relative immortality only.
