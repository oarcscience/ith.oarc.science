*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

26\. After that (there takes place) conjunction (of the soul) with him
who performs the act of generation.

The conclusion arrived at under the preceding Sûtra is confirmed also by
scripture stating that the souls, after having entered into plants,
'become' beings performing the

act of generation, 'for whoever eats the food, whoever performs the act
of generation, that again he (the soul) becomes.' Here again the soul's
'becoming' he who performs the act of generation cannot be taken in its
literal sense; for a person becomes capable of generation a long time
after his birth only, viz. when he reaches puberty. How then should the
soul contained in the food eaten enter into that condition in its true
sense? Hence we must interpret the passage to mean only that the soul
enters into conjunction with one who performs the act of generation; and
from this we again infer that the soul's becoming a plant merely means
its entering into conjunction with a plant.
