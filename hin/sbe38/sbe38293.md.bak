*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

13\. For (in the text) of some (the denial of the soul's departure) is
clear.

The assertion that also the soul of him who knows Brahman departs from
the body, because the denial states the soul (not the body) to be the
point of departure, cannot be upheld. For we observe that in the sacred
text of some there is a clear denial of a departure, the starting-point
of which is the body.--The text meant at first records the question
asked by Ârtabhâga, 'When this man dies, do the vital spirits depart
from him or not?' then embraces the alternative of non-departure, in the
words, No, replied Yâ*gñ*avalkya; thereupon--anticipating the objection
that

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

a man cannot be dead as long as his vital spirits have not
departed--teaches the resolution of the prâ*n*as in the body 'in that
very same place they are merged;' and finally, in confirmation thereof,
remarks, 'he swells, he is inflated, inflated the dead man lies.' This
last clause states that swelling, &c., affect the subject under
discussion, viz. that from which the departure takes place (the 'tasmât'
of the former clause), which subject is, in this last clause, referred
to by means of the word 'He.' Now swelling and so on can belong to the
body only, not to the embodied soul. And owing to its equality
thereto <span id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_220.md) also the passages, 'from
him the vital spirits do not depart;' 'in that very same place they are
resolved,' have to be taken as denying a departure starting from the
body, although the chief subject of the passage is the embodied soul.
This may be done by the embodied soul and the body being viewed as
non-different <span id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_221.md). In this way we have
to explain the passage if read with the fifth case.--If again the
passage is read with the sixth case ('of him the vital spirits do not
depart'), it must be understood as denying the departure of him who
knows, as its purport manifestly is to deny a departure established
elsewhere. But what it denies can only be a departure from the body; for
what is established (viz. for ordinary men not possessing the highest
knowledge) is only the departure (of the soul, &c.) from the body, not
the departure (of the prâ*n*as, &c.) from the embodied soul.--Moreover,
after the passage, 'Either through the eye or through the skull or
through other places of the body, him thus departing the prâ*n*a departs
after, and after the departing prâ*n*a all prâ*n*as depart,' &c., has at
length described the departure and transmigration of the soul as
belonging to him who does not know, and after the account of him

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

who does not know has been concluded with the words. 'So much for the
man who has desires,' the text designates him who knows as 'he who has
no desires;' a designation which, would be altogether inappropriate if
the text wanted to establish departure, &c., for that person also. The
passage therefore has to be explained as denying of him who knows the
going and departing which are established for him who does not know. For
thus only the designation employed by the text has a sense.--And for him
who knowing Brahman has become the Self of that omnipresent Brahman, and
in whom all desires and works have become extinct, departing and going
are not even possible, as there is not any occasion for them. And such
texts as 'there he reaches Brahman' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 7) indicate the
absence of all going and departing.

viewed as non-different, the pronoun (tasmât), which properly denotes
the soul, the person, may be used to denote the
body.--Abhedopa*k*âre*n*a dehadehinor dehaparâmar*s*inâ sarvanâmnâ deha
