*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

4\. (Scripture) also declares this.

The Veda also declares the identity of the vidyâs; for all Vedânta-texts
represent the object of knowledge as one; cp. e.g. Kâ. Up. I, 2, 15,
'That word which all the Vedas record;' Ait. Âr. Ill, 2,3,12, 'Him only
the Bahv*ri*kas consider in the great hymn, the Adhvaryus in the
sacrificial fire, the *Kh*andogas in the Mahâvrata ceremony.'--To quote
some other instances proving the unity of the vidyâs: Kâ. Up. I, 6, 2,
mentions as one of the Lord's qualities that he

causes fear; now this very same quality is referred to in the Taitt. Up.
II, 7, in order to intimate disapprobation of those who are opposed to
the absolute unity of that which is, 'For if he makes but the smallest
distinction in it (the Self), there is fear for him. But that fear is
only for him who knows (a difference) and does not know (the
oneness).'--Similarly the Vai*s*vânara, who in the Vâ*g*asaneyaka is
imaginatively represented as a span long, is referred to in the
*Kh*ândogya as something well known, 'But he who worships that
Vai*s*vânara Self which is a span long,' &c. (*Kh*. Up. V, 18, 1).

And as, on the ground of all Vedânta-texts intimating the same matters,
hymns and the like which are enjoined in one place are employed in other
places (where they are not expressly enjoined) for the purposes of
devout meditation, it follows that all Vedânta-texts intimate also
(identical) devout meditations.
