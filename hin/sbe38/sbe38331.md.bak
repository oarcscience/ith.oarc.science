*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

15\. The entering (of one soul into several bodies) is like (the
multiplication of) the flame of a lamp; for thus scripture declares.

Under Sûtra 11 it has been shown that the released person is embodied.
The question now arises whether the bodies which the released create for
themselves when rendering themselves threefold and so on are soulless
like wooden figures, or animated by souls like the bodies of us
men.--The pûrvapakshin maintains that as neither the soul nor the manas
can be divided they are joined with one body only, while the other
bodies are soulless.--To this the Sûtrakâra replies, 'Like the flame of
a lamp is their entering,' i.e. just as the one flame of a lamp can pass
over into several flames (lighted at the original flame), because it
possesses

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

the power of modifying itself, thus the soul of him who knows, although
one only, multiplying itself through its lordly power, enters into all
those bodies. For scripture declares that in this way one may become
many, 'He is onefold, he is threefold, fivefold, sevenfold' (*Kh*. Up.
VII, 26, 2). And this is not possible, if we should accept the simile of
the wooden puppets, or the entering of other souls into those additional
bodies <span id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_235.md). Nor again can there be any
motion on the part of bodies destitute of souls.--Nor is there any force
in the objection that, because the Self and the Manas cannot be divided,
they cannot be in connexion with more than one body. For the Self,
because possessing the quality of having true wishes (i.e. wishes which
become real), may be supposed to create other bodies with internal
organs, conformable to the original one organ; and, the Self dividing
itself through the division of its limiting adjuncts, it may be possible
to give a soul to each created body. This is the topic which the books
on Yoga treat, in the chapters explaining the connexion of one soul with
several bodies.--But how can lordly power, enabling the released soul to
enter into several bodies, be admitted, if we consider that different
scriptural texts declare that the soul in that state has not any
specific cognition? so e.g. 'Whereby should he know another?' 'For there
is then no second, nothing else different from him that he could know;'
'An ocean is that one seer, without any duality' (B*ri*. Up. II, 4, 14;
IV, 3, 30; 32).

To this objection the next Sûtra replies.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_234"></span>[413:1](sbe38328.htm#fr_234.md) See Pûrva
Mîmâ*m*sâ-sûtras II, 3, 5th adhikara*n*a.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[414:1](sbe38331.htm#fr_235.md) I.e. the
scriptural statement about one Self rendering itself manifold can
neither be reconciled with the hypothesis of the other bodies being
moved by the one soul as puppets are moved by one person through
strings, nor with the hypothesis of a new separate soul entering each
new body.
