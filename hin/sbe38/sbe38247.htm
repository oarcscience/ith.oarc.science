<p>38. And the promotion (of knowledge is bestowed on them) through special acts.</p>  
<p>Also for widowers, &amp;c., the favour of knowledge is possible through special acts of duty, such as praying, fasting, propitiation of divinities, &amp;c., which are not opposed to their &acirc;<I>s</I>rama-less condition and may be performed by any man as such. Thus Sm<I>ri</I>ti says, 'By mere prayer no doubt the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a perfects himself. May he perform other works or not, the kindhearted one is called Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (Manu Sa<I>m</I>h. II, 87), which passage shows that where the works of the &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas are not possible prayer qualifies for knowledge. Moreover knowledge may be promoted by &acirc;<I>s</I>rama works performed in previous births. Thus Sm<I>ri</I>ti also declares, 'Perfected by many births he finally goes the highest way' (Bha. G&icirc;t&acirc; VI, 45); which passage shows that the aggregate of the different purificatory ceremonies performed in former births promotes knowledge.--Moreover knowledge--as having a seen result (viz. the removal of ignorance)--qualifies any one who is desirous of it for learning and so on, through the mere absence of obstacles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Hence there is no contradiction in admitting qualification for knowledge on the part of widowers and the like.</p>
