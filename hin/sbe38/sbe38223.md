*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

14\. Or else the permission (of works) is for the glorification (of
knowledge).

The passage 'Performing works here' may be treated in another way also.
Even if, owing to the influence of the general subject-matter, only he
who knows is to be viewed as he who performs works, yet the permission
to perform works must be viewed as aiming at the glorification of
knowledge; as appears from the subsequent clause, 'no work clings to the
man.' The meaning of the entire passage thus is: To a man who knows no
work will cling, should he perform works during his whole life even,
owing to the power of knowledge. And this clearly glorifies knowledge.
