*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

10\. On the passing away of the effected (world of Brahman) (the souls
go) together with the ruler of that (world) to what is higher than that;
on account of scriptural declaration.

When the reabsorption of the effected Brahman world draws near, the
souls in which meanwhile perfect knowledge has sprung up proceed,
together with Hira*n*yagarbha the ruler of that world, to 'what is
higher than that i.e. to the pure highest place of Vishnu. This is the
release by successive steps which we have to accept on the basis of the
scriptural declarations about the non-return of the souls. For we have
shown that the Highest cannot be directly reached by the act of going.
