*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

56\. Or else there is no contradiction (implied in our opinion); as in
the case of mantras and the like.

Or else we may put the matter as follows. There is no reason whatever to
suspect a contradiction if we declare certain vidyâs enjoined in one
*S*âkhâ to be valid for the udgîtha and so on belonging to other
*S*âkhâs also; for there is no more room for contradiction than in the
case of mantras. We observe that mantras, acts, and qualities of acts
which are enjoined in one *S*âkhâ are taken over by other *S*âkhâs also.
So e.g. the members of certain Ya*g*ur-veda *S*âkhâs do not exhibit in
their text the mantra, 'Thou art the ku*t*aru <span
id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md)', which accompanies the taking of the
stone (with which the rice-grains are ground); all the same we meet in
their text with the following injunction of application, 'Thou art the
cock, with this mantra he takes the stone; or else with the mantra, Thou
art the ku*t*aru.'

Again, the text of some *S*âkhâ does not contain a direct injunction of
the five offerings called prayâ*g*as which are made to the fuel and so
on, but it contains the injunction of secondary matters connected with
the prayâ*g*as, viz. in the passage, 'the seasons indeed are the
prayâ*g*as; they are to be offered in one and the same spot <span
id="fr_171"></span>[1](sbe38200.htm#fn_171.md).'--Again, the text of some
*S*âkhâ does not contain an injunction as to the species of the animal
to be sacrificed to Agnîshomau--such as would be 'a he-goat is
sacrificed to Agnîshomau <span
id="fr_172"></span>[2](sbe38200.htm#fn_172.md);'--but in the same *S*âkhâ
we meet with a mantra which contains the required specification,
'Hot*ri*', recite the anuvâkyâ, for the fat of the omentum of the
he-goat <span id="fr_173"></span>[3](sbe38200.htm#fn_173.md).' Similarly
mantras enjoined in one Veda only, such as 'O Agni, promote the hautra,
promote the sacrifice,' are seen to be taken over into other Vedas also.
Another example (of the transference of mantras) is supplied by the
hymn, 'He who as soon as born showed himself intelligent,' &c. (*Rik*.
Sa*m*h. II, 12), which although read in the text of the Bahv*ri*kas is
employed in the Taittirîya Veda also, according to Taitt. Sa*m*h. VII,
5, 5, 2, 'The Sa*g*anîya hymn is to be recited.'--Just as, therefore,
the members of sacrificial actions on which certain vidyâs rest are
valid everywhere, so the vidyâs themselves also which rest on those
members are valid for all *S*âkhâs and Vedas.
