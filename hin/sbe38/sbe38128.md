*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

25\. And as in the case of (physical) light and the like, there is
non-distinction (of the two Selfs), the light (i.e. the intelligent
Self) (being divided) by its activity; according to the repeated
declarations of scripture.

As light, ether, the sun and so on appear differentiated as it were
through their objects such as fingers, vessels, water and so on which
constitute limiting adjuncts <span id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_120.md),
while in reality they preserve their essential non-differentiatedness;
so the distinction of different Selfs is due to limiting adjuncts only,
while the unity of all Selfs is natural and original. For on the
doctrine of the non-difference of the individual soul and the highest
Self the Vedânta-texts insist again and again. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_120"></span>[172:2](sbe38128.htm#fr_120.md) Light is
differentiated as it were by the various objects on which it shines; the
all-pervading ether is divided into parts as it were by hollow bodies;
the sun is multiplied as it were by its reflections in the water.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[172:3](sbe38128.htm#fr_121.md) It certainly looks
here as if the Bhâshyakâra did not know what to do with the words of the
Sûtra. The 'karma*n*i,' which is <span id="page_173">p. 173</span> as
good as passed over by him, is explained by Go. Ân. as
'dhyânâdikarma*n*y upâdhau.' Ân. Gi. says,
'âtmâprakâ*s*a*s*abdito<sup>ऽ</sup>*gñ*ânatatkârye karma*n*y upâdhau
savi*s*eshas' &c.
