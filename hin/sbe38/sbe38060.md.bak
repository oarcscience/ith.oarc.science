6\. But (there are also, in addition to the seven prâ*n*as mentioned,)
the hands and so on. This being a settled matter, therefore (we must)
not (conclude) thus (viz. that there are seven prâ*n*as only).

In addition to the seven prâ*n*as scripture mentions other prâ*n*as
also, such as the hands, &c., 'The hand is one graha and that is seized
by work as the atigraha; for with the hands one does work' (B*ri*. Up.
III, 2, 8), and similar passages. And as it is settled that there are
more than seven, the number seven may be explained as being contained
within the greater number. For wherever there is a conflict between a
higher and a lower number, the higher number has to be accepted because
the lower one is contained within it; while the higher is not contained
within the lower. We therefore must not conclude that, in deference to
the lower

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

number, seven prâ*n*as have to be assumed, but rather that there are
eleven prâ*n*as, in deference to the higher number. This conclusion is
confirmed by one of the passages quoted, 'Ten are these prâ*n*as in man,
and Âtman is the eleventh.' By the word Âtman we have to understand the
internal organ, on account of its ruling over the organs. Should it be
objected that scripture also mentions numbers higher than eleven, viz.
twelve and thirteen, we admit that, but remark that there are no
objective effects in addition to the eleven (well-known) objective
effects on account of which additional organs would have to be assumed.
There are five distinctions of buddhi having for their respective
objects sound, touch, colour, taste, and smell, and on their account
there are the five intellectual organs; again there are five classes of
action, viz. speaking, taking, going, evacuation, and begetting, and on
their account there are the five organs of action; finally there is the
manas which has all things for its objects and extends to the past, the
present, and the future; it is one only but has various functions. On
account of the plurality of its functions we find it designated by
different terms in different places, as manas or buddhi or aha*m*kâra or
*k*itta. Thus scripture also after having enumerated the various
functions such as desire, &c., says at the end, 'All this is manas
only.'--That passage again which speaks of the prâ*n*as of the head as
seven means four prâ*n*as only, which on account of the plurality of
their places may be counted as seven; viz. the two ears, the two eyes,
the two nostrils, and speech.--Nor can it be maintained that there are
in reality only so many (i.e. seven), the other prâ*n*as being mere
functions of the seven; for the functions of the hands and so on are
absolutely different (from the functions of the seven senses admitted by
the pûrvapakshin).--Again, in the passage 'Nine prâ*n*as indeed are in
man, the navel is the tenth,' the expression 'ten prâ*n*as' is used to
denote the different openings of the human body, not the difference of
nature of the prâ*n*as, as we conclude from the navel being mentioned as
the eleventh. For no prâ*n*a is known that bears the name of navel; but
the navel as being one of the special abodes of the chief prâ*n*a is
here enumerated

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

as a tenth prâ*n*a.--In some places so and so many are counted for the
purpose of meditation; in other places so and so many for the purpose of
illustration <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md). As the statements
concerning the number of the prâ*n*as are of so varying a nature we must
therefore distinguish in each case what the object of the statement is.
Meanwhile it remains a settled conclusion that that statement which
makes the prâ*n*as to be eleven is authoritative, on account of the
objective effects (being eleven also).

The two Sûtras (referring to the number of the prâ*n*as) may be
construed in the following manner also. The prâ*n*as are seven because
scripture mentions the going (gati) of seven only, 'When he thus departs
life departs after him, and when life thus departs all the other
prâ*n*as <span id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54.md) depart after it' (B*ri*.
Up. IV, 4, 2).--But, it may be objected, this passage says 'all the
other prâ*n*as;' how then does it declare the going of seven only?--The
Sûtra replies, 'on account of their being specified.' Seven senses only,
from seeing up to feeling, are specified there because so many only are
under discussion; as we see from the enumeration given in the passage,
'When that person in the eye turns away then he ceases to know any
forms. He has become one they say. he does not see' &c. The word 'all'
refers here only to what is under discussion, i.e. only to the seven
prâ*n*as mentioned before, not to any other. Analogously when we say
'all the Brâhma*n*as have been fed,' we mean only those Brâhma*n*as who
have been invited and concern us at the time, not any other.--If it be
objected that the passage quoted mentions understanding (vi*gñ*âna) as
the eighth thing departing, and that we therefore have no right to speak
of the departing of seven only, we reply that manas and understanding
differ not in essential nature but only in function, and that on this
account we are entitled to speak of seven prâ*n*as only.--The answer to
this

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

pûrvapaksha is as follows.--In addition to the seven senses, other
prâ*n*as also, such as the hands, are known to exist, as we see from
such passages as 'The hands are one graha,' &c. (B*ri*. Up. III, 2, 8).
By their being a graha (seizer) is meant that they are bonds by which
the individual soul (kshetra*gñ*a) is tied. Now the individual soul is
tied not in one body only, but is equally tied in other bodies also.
Hence it follows that that bond called graha (i.e. among other things
the hands) moves over into other bodies also. Sm*ri*ti also ('He--the
Self--is joined with the aggregate of eight, comprising breath,
&c. <span id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55.md), as his mark; his bondage
consists in being bound by it, his release in being freed from it')
shows that the Self is, previous to final release, not freed from the
bonds called grahas. And also in the enumeration of the senses and their
objects given by the Atharva*n*a Upanishad ('The eye and what can be
seen,' &c., Pr. Up. IV, 8), the organs of action such as the hands and
so on, together with their objects, are specified as well, 'the hands
and what can be grasped; the member and what can be delighted; the anus
and what can be evacuated; the feet and what can be walked.' Moreover
the passage, 'These ten vital breaths and âtman as the eleventh; when
they depart from this mortal body they make us cry' (B*ri*. Up. III, 9,
4), shows that eleven prâ*n*as depart from the body.--Moreover the word
'all' (which occurs in the passage. B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 2) must, because
connected with the word 'prâ*n*as,' denote all prâ*n*as, and cannot, on
the ground of general subject-matter, be limited to the seven prâ*n*as;
for a direct statement has greater force than the subject-matter. Even
in the analogous sentence, 'all Brâhma*n*as have been fed,' we have, on
the ground of the words, to understand all Brâhma*n*as living on the
earth; but because it is impossible to feed all Brâhma*n*as in the
latter sense, we accept that meaning of

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'all,' according
to which it denotes all invited Brâhma*n*as. In our case on the other
hand there is no reason whatever for narrowing the meaning of
'all.'--Hence the word 'all' includes all prâ*n*as without exception.
Nothing on the other hand prevents the enumeration of seven prâ*n*as
being taken as illustrative only. It is therefore an established
conclusion, resting on the number of the effects as well as on Vedic
statement, that there are eleven prâ*n*as.
