*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

25\. For this very reason there is no need of the lighting of the fire
and so on.

The expression 'For this very same reason' must be viewed as taking up
Sutra III, 4, 1, because thus a satisfactory sense is established. For
this very same reason, i.e. because knowledge subserves the purpose of
man, the lighting of the sacrificial fire and similar works which are
enjoined on the different â*s*ramas are not to be observed, since man's
purpose is effected through knowledge.

The Sûtrakâra thus sums up the result of the first adhikara*n*a,
intending to make some further remarks.
