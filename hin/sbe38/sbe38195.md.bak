*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

52\. And from the subsequent (Brâhma*n*a) it follows that being of that
kind (i.e. injunction of a mere vidyâ) (is the aim) of the text. The
connexion (of the fanciful agnis with the real one) is due to the
plurality (of details of the real agni which are imaginatively connected
with the vidyâ).

With regard to a subsequent Brâhma*n*a also, viz. the one beginning,
'That piled agni is this world indeed,' we apprehend that what is the
purpose of the text is 'being of that kind,' i.e. injunction of a mere
vidyâ, not injunction of the member of a mere action. For we meet there
with the following *s*loka,' By knowledge they ascend there where all
wishes are attained. Those skilled in works do not go there, nor those
who destitute of knowledge do penance.' This verse blames mere works and
praises knowledge. A former Brâhma*n*a also, viz. the one beginning,
'What that orb leads' (*S*at. Brâ. X, 5, 2, 23), concludes with a
statement of the fruit of knowledge ('Immortal becomes he whose Self is
death'), and thereby indicates that works are not the chief thing.--The
text connects the vidyâ (of the agnis built of

mind) with the real agni built of bricks, not because those agnis are
members of the act of building the real agni, but because many of the
elements of the real agni are imaginatively combined with the vidyâ.

All this establishes the conclusion that the fire-altars built of mind
and so on constitute a mere vidyâ.
