*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

6\. From thence (the souls are led) by him only who belongs to the
lightning; the sacred text stating that.

From thence, i.e. after they have come to the lightning they go to the
world of Brahman, being led through the worlds of Varu*n*a and the rest
by the person, not a man, who follows immediately after the lightning.
For that that person leads them is stated in the following passage,
'When they have reached the place of lightning a person, not a man,
leads them to the world of Brahman' (B*ri*. Up. VI, 2, 15). Varu*n*a and
the rest, we must understand, favour them either by not hindering or
somehow assisting them.--Therefore it is well said that light and so on
are the gods who act as conductors.
