50\. And (the individual soul is) an appearance (reflection) only.

And that individual soul is to be considered a mere appearance of the
highest Self, like the reflection of the sun in the water; it is neither
directly that (i.e. the highest Self), nor a different thing. Hence just
as, when one reflected image of the sun trembles, another reflected
image does not on that account tremble also; so, when one soul is
connected with actions and results of actions, another soul is not on
that account connected likewise. There is therefore no confusion of
actions and results. And as that 'appearance' is the effect of
Nescience, it follows that the sa*m*sâra which is based on it (the
appearance) is also the

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

effect of Nescience, so that from the removal of the latter there
results the cognition of the soul being in reality nothing but Brahman.

For those, on the other hand, who maintain that there are many Selfs and
all of them all-pervading, it follows that there must be a confusion of
actions and results.--In what way?--According to the opinion of the
Sâṅkhyas there exist many all-pervading Selfs, whose nature is pure
intelligence, devoid of qualities and of unsurpassable excellence. For
the common purpose of all of them there exists the pradhâna, through
which the souls obtain enjoyment and release.--According to the
followers of Ka*n*âda there exist many all-pervading Selfs, but they
are, like so many jars or stools, mere substances and unintelligent in
themselves. With those Selfs there co-operate the internal organs
(manas), atomic and also unintelligent. From the conjunction of these
two classes of substances, viz. the Selfs and the internal organs, there
spring the nine special qualities of the Selfs, viz. desire, &c. <span
id="fr_44"></span>[1](#fn_44.md) These qualities inhere in the individual
Selfs separately, without any confusion, and that constitutes the
sa*m*sâra-state. Final release, on the other hand, consists in the
absolute non-origination of those nine qualities.

With regard to these opinions we remark that, as far as the Sâṅkhyas are
concerned, their doctrine that all Selfs are of the nature of
intelligence, and that there is no difference between them in the point
of proximity (to the pradhâna), &c. <span id="fr_45"></span>[2](#fn_45.md),
implies that, if one Self is connected with pleasure and pain, all Selfs
will be so connected.--Well but, the Sâṅkhya might reply, a difference
(in the connexion of the individual Selfs with pleasure and pain) may
result from the circumstance that the activity of the pradhâna aims at
the isolation (emancipation) of the Selfs <span
id="fr_46"></span>[3](#fn_46.md). Otherwise

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

the activity of the pradhâna would serve no other end but to manifest
the pradhâna's power, in consequence whereof no final release would ever
take place.--This argumentation, we reply, is not sound. For we have no
right to assume a difference which has for its only motive the
accomplishment of an end desirable (to us, viz. the emancipation of the
Selfs), but we must rather bring forward some proof for that difference.
If no such proof can be brought forward, the desired end, i.e. the
emancipation of the soul, must be supposed not to take place; while at
the same time the absence of any cause of difference establishes the
confusion of actions and their results.--Against the Kâ*n*âdas we urge
that if, on their theory, the internal organ is connected with one soul,
it must in the same way be connected with all other souls as well, as
there is no difference in the point of proximity, &c. <span
id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47.md) Hence, there being no difference of cause
and consequently no difference of effect, it follows that, when one soul
is connected with pleasure and pain, all souls are thus connected.--But
may not the limitation (of actions and their results) be caused by the
unseen principle (ad*ri*sh*t*a)? By no means, the following Sûtra
replies.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[69:1](sbe38051.htm#fr_44.md) Cognition, pleasure,
pain, desire, aversion, endeavour, merit, demerit, and bhâvanâ.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[69:2](sbe38051.htm#fr_45.md) The &c. implies the
non-activity (audâsînya) of the Selfs.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[69:3](sbe38051.htm#fr_46.md) And therefore
proceeds in a special definite direction capable of effecting in the end
the emancipation of some particular Self.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[70:1](sbe38051.htm#fr_47.md) The '&c.' implies
substantiality and so on.
