*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

20\. And for the same reason (the departed soul follows the rays) also
during the southern progress of the sun.

For the same reason, viz. because waiting is impossible, and because the
fruit of knowledge is not a merely eventual one, and because the time of
death is not fixed, also that possessor of true knowledge who dies
during the southern progress of the sun obtains the fruit of his
knowledge. Because dying during the northern progress of the sun is more
excellent, and because Bhîshma is known to have waited for that period,
and because scripture says, 'From the light half of the month (they go)
to the six months when the sun goes to the north,' it might be thought
that the northern progress of the sun is needful for dying. This notion
the Sûtra refutes. The greater excellence of the sun's northern progress
applies to those only who do not possess the highest
knowledge.--Bhîshma's waiting for the sun's northern progress was due to
his wish of upholding good customs and of showing that by the favour of
his father he could choose the time of his death.--And the sense of the
scriptural passage quoted will be explained under IV, 3, 4.--But we have
the following Sm*ri*ti-text, 'At what times the Yogins depart either not
to return or to return, those times I will declare to thee' (Bha. Gîtâ
VIII, 23), which determines specially that to die by day and so on
causes the soul not to return. How then can he who dies by night or
during the sun's southern progress depart not to return? Concerning this
point the next Sûtra remarks:
