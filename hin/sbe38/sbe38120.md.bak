*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

17\. (This scripture) also shows, and it is likewise stated in Sm*ri*ti.

That Brahman is without any difference is proved by those scriptural
passages also which expressly deny that it possesses any other
characteristics; so, e.g. 'Next follows the teaching by No, no' (B*ri*.
Up. II, 3, 6); 'It is different from the known, it is also above the
unknown' (Ke. Up. I, 4); 'From whence all speech, with the mind, turns
away unable to reach it' (Taitt. Up. II, 9). Of a similar purport is
that scriptural passage which relates how Bâhva, being questioned about
Brahman by Vashkalin, explained it to him by silence, 'He said to him,
"Learn Brahman, O friend," and became silent. Then, on a second and
third question, he replied, "I am teaching you indeed, but you do not
understand. Silent is that Self."' The same teaching is conveyed by
those Sm*ri*ti-texts which deny of Brahman all other characteristics;
so, e.g. 'I will proclaim that which is the object of knowledge, knowing
which one reaches immortality; the highest Brahman without either
beginning or end, which cannot be said either to be or not to be' (Bha.
Gîtâ XIII, 12). Of a similar purport is another Sm*ri*ti-passage,
according to which the omniform Nârâya*n*a instructed Nârada, 'The
cause, O Nârada, of your seeing me endowed with the qualities of all
beings is the Mâyâ emitted by me; do not cognize me as being such (in
reality).'
