21\. The third term comprises that which springs from heat.

The third term in the scriptural passage quoted, i.e. 'that which
springs from a germ,' must be understood as implying those beings also
which spring from heat; the two classes having in common that they
spring from earth or water, i.e. from something stable. Different from
their origin is the origin of those beings which spring from moving
things (viz. animals).--In other places the beings springing from heat
and those springing from germs are spoken of as constituting separate
classes.--Hence there is no contradiction.
