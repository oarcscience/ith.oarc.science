14\. And Sm*ri*ti also says that.

In the Mahâbhârata also it is said that those who know do not go or
depart, 'He who has become the Self of all beings and has a complete
intuition of all, at his way the gods themselves are perplexed, seeking
for the path of him who has no path.'--But, an objection is raised,
other passages speak of men knowing Brahman as going, so e.g. '*S*uka
the son of Vyâsa being desirous of release travelled to the sphere of
the sun; being called by his father who had followed him, he gave an
answering shout.'--That passage, we reply, describes (not the effects of
the highest knowledge but only) how an embodied person, through the
power of Yoga (which is of the nature of the lower knowledge), reached
some special place and freed himself from the body. This appears from it
being mentioned that he was seen by all beings; for the beings could not
see a person moving without a body. The conclusion of the story makes
all this clear, '*S*uka having moved through the air more rapidly than
wind, and having shown his power, was known by all beings.'--It thus
follows that he who knows Brahman neither moves nor departs. To what
sphere the scriptural texts about going and so on refer we shall explain
later on.
