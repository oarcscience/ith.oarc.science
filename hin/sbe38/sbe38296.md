*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

16\. (There is absolute) non-division (from Brahman, of the parts merged
in it); according to scriptural declaration.

When the parts of him who knows are merged in Brahman, is there a
remainder (which is not so merged), as in the case of other men; or is
there no such remainder? As the merging of him also who knows falls
under the general heading of merging, it might be assumed that of him
also there remains a potential body, and the Sûtrakâra therefore teaches
expressly that the elements, &c., of him who knows enter into the
relation of (absolute) non-division from Brahman.--On what
ground?--Because scripture declares this. For after having taught the
dissolution of the parts, the text continues, 'Their name and form are
broken, and people speak of the person only; and he becomes without
parts and immortal' (Pr. Up. VI, 5). And when parts that are due to
nescience are dissolved

through knowledge it is not possible that a remainder should be left.
The parts therefore enter into absolute non-division from Brahman.
