<p>36. (The same thing follows) from the express denial of other (existences).</p>  
<p>Having thus refuted the arguments of the p&ucirc;rvapakshin, the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra in conclusion strengthens his view by a further reason. A great number of Vedic passages--which, considering the context in which they stand, cannot be explained otherwise--distinctly deny that there exists anything apart from Brahman; 'He indeed is below; I am below; the Self is below' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. VII, 25, 1; 2); 'Whosoever looks for anything elsewhere than in the Self was abandoned by everything' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. II, 4, 6); 'Brahman</p>

<p>alone is all this' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'The Self is all this' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. VII, 25, 2): 'In it there is no diversity' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. IV, 4, 19); 'He to whom there is nothing superior, from whom there is nothing different' (<I>S</I>vet. Up. III, 9); 'This is the Brahman without cause and without effect, without anything inside or outside' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. II, 5, 19).--And that there is no other Self within the highest Self, follows from that scriptural passage which teaches Brahman to be within everything (B<I>ri</I>. Up. II, 5, 19).</p>
