*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

10\. If it be said that purposelessness (of conduct would result
therefrom), we deny this on account of the dependence (of work) on that
(conduct).

That may be; but for what reason should we abandon that meaning which
the term '*k*ara*n*a' directly conveys, viz. the meaning 'conduct,' and
accept the merely connotative meaning 'remainder of the works?' Conduct,
which the text directly mentions, may be supposed to have for its fruit
either a good or an evil birth, according as it is enjoined or
prohibited, good or evil. Some fruit will have to be allowed to it in
any case; for otherwise it would follow that it is purposeless.--This
objection is without force 'on account of the dependence on it.' Such
works as sacrifices, and the like, depend on conduct in so far as
somebody whose conduct is not good is not entitled to perform them. This
we know from Sm*ri*ti-passages, such as the following, 'Him who is
devoid of good conduct the Vedas do not purify.'--And also if conduct is
considered as subservient to man <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94) it
will not be purposeless. For when the aggregate of works such as
sacrifices, &c.. begins to originate its fruit, the conduct which has
reference to the sacrifice will originate there (i.e. in the fruit) some
addition.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And it is known
from *S*ruti as well as Sm*ri*ti that work effects everything <span
id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95). It is, therefore, the opinion of
Kârsh*n*â*g*ini that the remainder of works only--which is connoted by
the term 'conduct'--is the cause of the souls entering on new births.
For as work may be the cause of new births, it is not proper to assume
that conduct is the cause. If a man is able to run away by means of his
feet he will surely not creep on his knees.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_94"></span>[120:1](sbe38086.htm#fr_94) I.e. as something
which produces in man a sa*m*skâra analogous to that produced by other
preparatory or purificatory rites such as bathing, &c.--In the preceding
sentences conduct had been spoken of not as purushârtha but as karmâṅga.
In that case it produces no separate result; while if considered as
purushârtha it has a special result of its own.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[121:1](sbe38086.htm#fr_95) A clause added to
guard against the assumption--which might be based on the preceding
remarks--that conduct is, after all, the cause of the quality of the new
birth.
