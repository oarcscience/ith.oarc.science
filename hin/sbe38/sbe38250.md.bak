*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

41\. And not also (can the expiation take place) prescribed in the
chapter treating of qualification, because on account of the inference
of his lapse from Sm*ri*ti he (the Naish*th*ika) is not capable of it.

If a Brahma*k*ârin for life breaks from inattention the vow of chastity,
is he to perform the expiatory sacrifice enjoined by the text, 'A
student who has broken the vow of chastity shall sacrifice an ass to
Nir*ri*ti <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](sbe38251.htm#fn_202.md)' or not?--He
is not, the pûrvapakshin says. For although in the chapter which treats
of qualification (Pû. Mîm. Sû. VI, 8, 22) that expiatory ceremony has
been settled (for Brahma*k*ârins in general), it does not yet hold good
for the professed Brahma*k*ârin. For Sm*ri*ti declares that such sins
cannot be expiated by him any more than a head once cut off can again be
healed on to the body, 'He who having once entered on the duties of a
Naish*th*ika again lapses from them, for him--a slayer of the Self--I
see no expiation which might make him clean again. 'The Upakurvâ*n*a
(i.e. he who is a Brahma*k*ârin for a certain time only, not for life)
on the other hand, about whose sin Sm*ri*ti makes no similar
declaration, may purify himself by the ceremony mentioned.
