*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

6\. Not to one (element) (the soul goes); for both (i.e. scripture and
Sm*ri*ti) declare this.

At the time of passing over into another body the individual soul does
not abide in the one element of heat only; for we see that the new body
consists of various elements. This matter is declared in the question
and answer about the waters called man (*Kh*. Up. V, 3, 3); as explained
by us in III, 1, 2.--Scripture and Sm*ri*ti alike

teach this doctrine; compare e.g. 'Consisting of earth, water, wind,
ether, heat' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 5); and 'The subtle perishable parts of
the five (elements) from them all this is produced in due succession'
(Manu I, 27).--But is there not another scriptural
text--beginning--'Where then is that person?'--which teaches that at the
time of the soul attaining a new body, after speech and the other organs
have been withdrawn within the soul, work constitutes the soul's abode,
'What those two said, as work they said it; what they praised, as work
they praised it' (B*ri*. Up. III, 2. 13)?--That passage, we reply,
describes the operation of bondage consisting of the senses and their
objects--there called grahas and atigrahas--and therefore work is spoken
of as the abode; here on the other hand the elements are said to be the
abode because we have to do with the origination of a new body out of
the matter of the elements. The expression 'they prayed' moreover
intimates only that work occupies the chief place in the process, and
does not exclude another abode. The two passages therefore do not
contradict each other.
