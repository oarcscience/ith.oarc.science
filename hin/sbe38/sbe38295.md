15\. Those (elements, &c.) (are merged) in the highest Brahman; for thus
(scripture) says.

Those, i.e. the sense organs--denoted by the term 'prâ*n*a'--and the
elements of him who knows the highest Brahman, are merged in that same
highest Brahman.--Why?--Because scripture declares that 'Thus these
sixteen parts of the spectator that go towards the person, when they
have reached the person, sink into him' (Pr. Up. VI, 5).--But another
text which refers to him who knows teaches that the parts also are
merged in something different from the highest Self, 'The fifteen parts
enter into their elements' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 7).--No, we reply. This
latter passage is concerned with the ordinary view of the matter,
according to which the parts of the body which consist of earth and so
on are merged in their causal substances, earth and so on. The former
passage, on the other hand, expresses the view of him who knows;
according to which the whole aggregate of the parts of him who knows the
highest Brahman is merged in Brahman only.--There is thus no
contradiction.
