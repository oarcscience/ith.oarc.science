*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3\. On account of scripture showing (certain lines of) conduct.

'*G*anaka the king of the Videhas sacrificed with a sacrifice at which
many presents were given to the priests' (B*ri*. Up. III, 1, 1); 'Sirs,
I am going to perform a sacrifice' (*Kh*. Up. V, 11, 5); these and
similar passages--which occur in sections that have another
purport--show that those who know Brahman are connected with sacrificial
action also. And similarly we apprehend from the fact that according to
scripture Uddâlaka and others taught their sons and so on, that they
were connected with the condition of life of householders. If mere
knowledge could effect the purpose of man, why should the persons
mentioned have perforated works troublesome in many respects? 'If a man
would find honey in the Arka tree why should he go to the forest?'
