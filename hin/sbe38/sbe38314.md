*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

13\. And because scripture declares that.

The text, 'Going upwards by that he reaches immortality,' declares that
immortality is reached by going. But immortality is possible only in the
highest Brahman, not in the effected one, because the latter is
transitory. So scripture says, 'Where one sees something else, that is
little, that is mortal' (*Kh*. Up. VII, 24, 1). According to the text of
the Ka*th*a-upanishad also the going of the soul is towards the highest
Brahman; for after the highest Brahman has been introduced there as
general subject-matter--in the passage, 'That which thou seest,' &c., I,
2, 14, no other kind of knowledge is taken up later on.
