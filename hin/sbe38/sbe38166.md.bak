23\. And for the same reason the holding together and the pervading the
sky (attributed to Brahman in the Râ*n*âyanîya-khila) (are not to be
inserted in other vidyâs).

In the khilas (supplementary writings) of the Râ*n*âyanîyas we meet with
a passage, 'Held together are the powers among which Brahman is the
best; the best Brahman in the beginning stretched out the sky <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md),' which mentions certain energies of
Brahman, such as holding together its powers, entering into the sky, &c.
And in the

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

Upanishad of the same (i.e. the Râ*n*âyanîyas) we meet with vidyâs of
Brahman among which the Sâ*nd*ilya-vidyâ is the first.--The question
then arises whether the energies of Brahman just mentioned are to be
inserted in those Brahma-vidyâs or not. To the pûrvapaksha view that
they are to be so inserted because they are connected with Brahman, the
Sûtrakâra replies that the holding together and pervading the sky are
not to be inserted in the Sâ*nd*ilya-vidyâ and other vidyâs, for the
same reason, i.e. on account of their being connected with different
abodes. In the *S*â*nd*ilya-vidyâ, Brahman is said to have its abode in
the heart, 'He is the Self within the heart' (*Kh*. Up. III, 14, 3); the
same statement is made in the dahara-vidyâ, 'There is the palace, the
small lotus (of the heart), and in it that small ether' (VIII, 1, 1). In
the Upako*s*ala-vidyâ again, Brahman is said to reside within the eye,
'That person that is seen in the eye' (IV, 15, 1). In all these vidyâs
Brahman is described as residing within the body; it is therefore
impossible to insert into them the energies of Brahman which the khila
of the Râ*n*âyanîyas mentions, and which are connected with the Devas
(i.e. external nature).--But the vidyâs of the *Kh*ândogya likewise
mention such powers of Brahman as are connected with the Devas; cp. e.g.
III, 14, 3, 'He is greater than the heaven, greater than these worlds;'
IV, 15, 4, 'He is also Bhâmanî, for he shines in all worlds;' VIII, 1,
3, 'As large as this ether is, so large is that ether within the heart.
Both heaven and earth are contained within it.' And again there are
other vidyâs of Brahman, such as the one which represents Brahman as
comprising sixteen parts, in which not any special abode is
mentioned.--True; but there is a special reason why the attributes
stated in the Râ*n*âyanîya-khila cannot be introduced into the other
vidyâs. Particulars mentioned in one place can indeed be inserted in
vidyâs met with in another place if the latter are suggested to the mind
by containing some reference to agreeing particulars; the qualities of
holding together, however, on one side and those mentioned in the
Sâ*nd*ilya-vidyâ, &c., on the other side are of such a nature as to
exclude each

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

other, and therefore do not mutually suggest each other. The mere
circumstance of all the particulars being connected with Brahman does
not suffice to suggest vidyâs occurring in other places; for even in
vidyâs which are avowedly separate, all the particulars may be connected
with Brahman. And it is an established fact that Brahman, although one
only, is, owing to the plurality of its powers, meditated upon in more
than one way, as shown under Sûtra 7.--The conclusion therefore is that
the attributes of holding together its powers and so on are not to be
inserted in the Sâ*nd*ilya. and similar vidyâs.
