31\. On account of the appropriateness of the manifestation of that
(connexion) which exists (potentially); like virile power.

As in ordinary life virile power and so on, existing potentially only in
young children, and being then looked upon as non-existing, become
manifest at the time of puberty--and do not originate at that time from
previous non-existence, because in that case they might originate in
eunuchs also--; so the connexion of the soul with the

buddhi exists potentially merely during deep sleep and the period of
general retractation, and again becomes manifest at the time of waking
and the time of creation.--This explanation is appropriate, because
nothing can be assumed to spring up unless from something else;
otherwise we should have to suppose that effects spring up without
causes. That the rising from deep sleep is due to the existence of
potential avidyâ, scripture also declares, 'Having become merged in the
True they know not that they are merged in the True. Whatever these
creatures are here, whether a lion or a wolf,' &c. (*Kh*. Up. VI, 9, 2;
3).--It is therefore a proved matter that the connexion of the soul with
the buddhi and the other adjuncts lasts as long as the soul (in its
sa*m*sâra-state).
