38\. And the promotion (of knowledge is bestowed on them) through
special acts.

Also for widowers, &c., the favour of knowledge is possible through
special acts of duty, such as praying, fasting, propitiation of
divinities, &c., which are not opposed to their â*s*rama-less condition
and may be performed by any man as such. Thus Sm*ri*ti says, 'By mere
prayer no doubt the Brâhma*n*a perfects himself. May he perform other
works or not, the kindhearted one is called Brâhma*n*a (Manu Sa*m*h. II,
87), which passage shows that where the works of the â*s*ramas are not
possible prayer qualifies for knowledge. Moreover knowledge may be
promoted by â*s*rama works performed in previous births. Thus Sm*ri*ti
also declares, 'Perfected by many births he finally goes the highest
way' (Bha. Gîtâ VI, 45); which passage shows that the aggregate of the
different purificatory ceremonies performed in former births promotes
knowledge.--Moreover knowledge--as having a seen result (viz. the
removal of ignorance)--qualifies any one who is desirous of it for
learning and so on, through the mere absence of obstacles <span

admitting qualification for knowledge on the part of widowers and the
like.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[316:1](sbe38247.htm#fr_201.md) I.e. any one who
wishes to learn may do so, if only there is no obstacle in the way. No
special injunction is wanted.
