*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

12\. Of him who has merely read the Veda (there is qualification for
works).

As the clause, 'Having learnt (read) the Veda from a family of
teachers,' speaks only of the reading, we determine that acts are there
enjoined for him who has only read the Veda.--But from this it would
follow that on account of being destitute of knowledge such a person
would not be qualified for works!--Never mind; we do not mean to deny
that the understanding of sacrificial acts which springs from the
reading of the texts is the cause of qualification for their
performance; we only wish to establish that the knowledge of the Self
derived from the Upanishads is seen to have an independent purpose of
its own and therefore does not supply a reason of qualification for
acts. Analogously a person who is qualified for one act does not require
the knowledge of another act.

Against the reasoning of Sûtra 7 we make the following remark.
