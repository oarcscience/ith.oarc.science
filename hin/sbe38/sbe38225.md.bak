actions, agents and results of actions and is the cause of all
qualification for works--is essentially destroyed by the power of
knowledge. Compare such passages as 'But when all has become the Self of
him, wherewith should he see another, wherewith should he smell
another?' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 5, 15). For him now who should teach that the
qualification for works has for its necessary antecedent the knowledge
of the Self which the Vedânta-texts teach, it would follow that the
qualification for works is cut short altogether. From this also it
follows that knowledge is independent.
