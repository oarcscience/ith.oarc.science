8\. And on account of thoughtfulness.

Moreover also the word 'thoughtfulness' denotes a lengthened carrying on
of the same train of ideas. Now 'thoughtfulness' we ascribe to those
whose mind is concentrated on one and the same object, while their look
is fixed and their limbs move only very slightly. We say e.g. that the
crane is thoughtful, or that a wife whose husband has gone on a journey
is thoughtful. Now such thoughtfulness is easy for those who sit; and we
therefore conclude herefrom also that meditation is the occupation of a
sitting person.
