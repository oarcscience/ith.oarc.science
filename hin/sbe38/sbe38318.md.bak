### FOURTH PÂDA.

REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!

1\. (On the soul's) having entered (into the highest light), there is
manifestation (of its own nature); (as we infer) from the word 'own.'

'Thus does that serene being, having risen out of this body and entered
into the highest light, manifest itself by its own nature' (*Kh*. Up.
VII, 12, 3). Regarding this text a doubt arises whether the Self <span
id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_231.md) manifests itself through some
adventitious distinction--as the Self (of him who possesses the lower
knowledge only) does in the world of the gods and other abodes of
enjoyment--or only through its own Self.--The pûrvapakshin maintains
that, as in other places, here also the manifestation takes place
through some adventitious characteristic; because release also is a
fruit (like other fruits, e.g. svarga), and because 'manifestation'
means as much as origination. If the manifestation took place only
through the Self's own nature, it would already appear in the Self's
former states: for a thing's own nature is never absent from it. The
Self therefore manifests itself by means of some adventitious
distinction.

To this we make the following reply. It manifests itself through its
Self only, not through any other attribute.--Why so?--On account of the
word 'own' in the clause 'by its own nature.' For on the other view the
qualification conveyed by 'own' would be unmeaning.--But may not the
term 'own' merely indicate that that form belongs to that which
manifests itself?--Not so, we reply. This is a point which would not
require to be stated. For as in

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

whatever form a thing manifests itself that form necessarily belongs to
it, the qualification 'own' would be devoid of purport. It has a
meaning, on the other hand, if it denotes the Self, the sense conveyed
then being that the manifestation takes place only through the nature of
the Self, not through any other, adventitious, nature.--But, as a thing
cannot be without its own nature, what difference is there between the
Self's former states and its present state (after the
manifestation)?--To this question the next Sûtra replies.
