*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5\. To the elements (the soul, with prâ*n*a, goes), on account of the
subsequent scriptural clause.

The soul joined by the prâ*n*a takes up its abode within the subtle
elements which accompany heat and form the seed of the (gross) body.
This we conclude from the clause, 'Breath in heat.'--But this passage
declares, not that the soul together with the prâ*n*a takes up its abode
in heat, but only that the prâ*n*a takes up its abode!--No matter, we
reply; since the preceding Sûtra intercalates the soul in the interval
(between prâ*n*a and te*g*as). Of a man who first travels
from--*S*rughna to Mathurâ and then from Mathurâ to Pâ*t*aliputra, we
may say shortly that he travels from--*S*rughna to Pâ*t*aliputra. The
passage under discussion therefore means that the soul together with the
prâ*n*a abides in the elements associated with heat.--But how are you
entitled to draw in the other elements also, while the text only speaks
of heat?--To this question the next Sûtra replies.
