7\. Sitting (a man is to meditate), on account of the possibility.

As meditations connected with members of sacrificial action depend on
action, we need not raise the question whether they are to be carried on
in a sitting, or any other posture. The same holds good in the case of
perfect intuition, since knowledge depends on its object only. With
regard to all other meditations, on the other hand, the author of the
Sûtras raises the question whether they may be undertaken indifferently
by a person standing, sitting, or lying down, or only by a person
sitting.

The pûrvapakshin here maintains that as meditation is something mental
there can be no restriction as to the attitude of the body.--No, the
author of the Sûtras rejoins; 'Sitting' only a man is to
meditate.--Why?--'On account of the possibility.' By meditation we
understand the lengthened carrying on of an identical train of thought;
and of this a man is capable neither when going nor when running, since
the act of going and so on tends to distract the mind.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The mind of a
standing man, again, is directed on maintaining the body in an erect
position, and therefore incapable of reflection on any subtle matter. A
man lying down, finally, is unawares overcome by slumber. A sitting
person, on the other hand, may easily avoid these several untoward
occurrences, and is therefore in a position to carry on meditations.
