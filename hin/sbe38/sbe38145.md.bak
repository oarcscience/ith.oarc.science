*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2\. (If it be said that the vidyâs are separate) on account of the
difference (of secondary matters), we deny that, since even in one and
the same vidyâ (different secondary matters may find place).

In spite of the preceding argumentation we cannot admit that the
different cognitions of Brahman are equally intimated by all
Vedânta-texts, because we meet with differences in secondary matters
(gu*n*a). Thus the Vâ*g*asaneyins mention in their text of the knowledge
of the five fires a sixth fire ('And then the fire is indeed fire,'
B*ri*. Up. VI, 2, 14), while the *Kh*andogas mention no sixth fire but
conclude their text of the pa*ñk*âgnividyâ with the express mention of
five fires ('But he who thus knows the five fires,' *Kh*. Up. V, 10,
10).

Now it is impossible to admit that the cognition of those who admit that
particular qualification (i.e. the sixth fire) and of those who do not
should be one and the same. Nor may we attempt to evade the difficulty
by saying that the sixth fire may be tacitly included in the vidyâ of
the *Kh*andogas; for that would contradict the number 'five' expressly
stated by them.--In the colloquy of the prâ*n*as

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

again the *Kh*andogas mention, in addition to the most important
prâ*n*a, four other prâ*n*as, viz. speech, the eye, the ear, and the
mind; while the Vâ*g*asaneyins mention a fifth one also, 'Seed indeed is
generation. He who knows that becomes rich in offspring and cattle'
(B*ri*. Up. VI, 1, 6).--Now a difference of procedure in the point of
addition and omission effects a difference in the object known, and the
latter again effects a difference in the vidyâ, just as a difference in
the point of material and divinity distinguishes one sacrifice from
another.

To this we make the following reply.--Your objection is without force,
since such differences of qualification as are met with in the above
instances are possible even in one and the same vidyâ. In the
*Kh*ândogya-text a sixth fire is indeed not included; yet, as five
fires, beginning with the heavenly world, are recognised as the same in
both texts the mentioned difference cannot effect a split of the vidyâ;
not any more than the âtirâtra-sacrifice is differentiated by the
sho*d*a*s*in-rite being either used or not-used. Moreover, the
*Kh*ândogya-text also actually mentions a sixth fire, viz. in the
passage, V, 9, 2, 'When he has departed, his friends carry him, as
appointed, to the fire'. The Vâ*g*asaneyins, on the other hand, mention
their sixth fire ('and then the fire is indeed fire, the fuel fuel,'
&c.) for the purpose of cutting short the fanciful assumption regarding
fuel, smoke, and so on, which runs through the description of the five
fires with which the heavenly world and so on are imaginatively
identified. Their statement regarding the sixth fire (has therefore not
the purpose of enjoining it as an object of meditation but) is merely a
remark about something already established (known) <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md). And even if we assume that the
statement about the sixth fire has the purpose of representing that fire
as an object of devout meditation, yet the fire may be inserted in the
vidyâ of the *Kh*andogas without any fear of its being in conflict with
the number five mentioned there;

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

for that number is not an essential part of the injunction <span
id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md), but merely makes an additional
statement regarding something known already from the text, viz. the five
fires with which the heavenly world and so on are identified <span
id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_127.md). Similarly nothing stands in the way of
some additional qualification being included in the vidyâ concerning the
colloquy of the prâ*n*as and so on. The addition or omission of some
particular qualification is unable to introduce difference into the
object of knowledge and thereby into the knowledge itself; for although
the objects of knowledge may differ partly, yet their greater part and
at the same time the knowing person are understood to be the same. Hence
the vidyâ also remains the same.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_125"></span>[188:1](sbe38145.htm#fr_125.md) Viz. the real fire
in which the dead body is burned and which is known from perception.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[189:1](sbe38145.htm#fr_126.md) I.e. the
*Kh*ândogya-text contains no injunction that five fires only are to be
meditated upon.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[189:2](sbe38145.htm#fr_127.md) So that there
stands nothing in the way of our amplifying our meditation by the
addition of a sixth fire.
