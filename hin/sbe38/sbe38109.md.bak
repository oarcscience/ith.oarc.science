6\. Or that (viz. the concealment of the soul's powers springs) from its
connexion with the body.

But if the soul is a part of the highest Self, why should its knowledge
and lordship be hidden? We should rather

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

expect them to be as manifest as the light and the heat of the
spark.--True, we reply; but the state of concealment of the soul's
knowledge and lordship is due to its being joined to a body, i.e. to a
body, sense-organs, mind, buddhi, sense-objects, sensations, &c. And to
this state of things there applies the simile: As the heat and light of
the fire are hidden as long as the fire is still hidden in the wood from
which it will be produced by friction, or as long as it is covered by
ashes; so, in consequence of the soul being connected with limiting
adjuncts in the form of a body, &c., founded on name and form as
presented by Nescience, its knowledge and lordship remain hidden as long
as it is possessed by the erroneous notion of not being distinct from
those adjuncts.--The word 'or' in the Sûtra is meant to discard the
suspicion that the Lord and the soul might be separate entities.--But
why should not the soul be separate from the Lord, considering the state
of concealment of its knowledge and power? If we allow the two to be
fundamentally separate, we need not assume that their separateness is
due to the soul's connexion with the body.--It is impossible, we reply,
to assume the soul to be separate from the Lord. For in the scriptural
passage beginning with 'That divinity thought' &c. (*Kh*. Up. VI, 3, 2)
we meet with the clause, 'It entered into those beings with this living
Self (*g*îva âtman); where the individual soul is referred to as the
Self. And then we have the other passage, 'It is the True; it is the
Self; that art thou, O *S*vetaketu,' which again teaches that the Lord
is the Self of the soul. Hence the soul is non-different from the Lord,
but its knowledge and power are obscured by its connexion with the body.
From this it follows that the dreaming soul is not able to create, from
its mere wishes, chariots and other things. If the soul possessed that
power, nobody would ever have an unpleasant dream; for nobody ever
wishes for something unpleasant to himself.--We finally deny that the
scriptural passage about the waking state ('dream is the same as the
place of waking' &c.) indicates the reality of dreams. The statement
made there about the equality of the two states

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

is not meant to indicate that dreams are real, for that would conflict
with the soul's self-luminousness (referred to above), and scripture,
moreover, expressly declares that the chariots, &c., of a dream have no
real existence; it merely means that dreams, because due to mental
impressions (vâsanâ) received in the waking state, are equal to the
latter in appearance.--From all this it follows that dreams are mere
illusion.
