42\. But some (consider the sin) a minor one, (and

hence claim) the existence (of expiation for the Naish*th*ika also); as
in the case of the eating (of unlawful food). This has been explained
(in the Pûrva Mîmâ*m*sâ).

Some teachers, however, are of opinion that the transgression of the vow
of chastity, even on the part of a professed Brahma*k*ârin, is a minor
sin, not a mortal one, excepting cases where the wife of the teacher and
so on are concerned. For they plead that that sin is not anywhere
enumerated among the deadly ones such as violating a teacher's bed and
so on. Accordingly they claim the expiatory ceremony to be valid for the
Naish*th*ika as well as the Upakurvâ*n*a; both being alike
Brahma*k*ârins and having committed the same offence. The case is
analogous to that of eating. Just as Brahma*k*ârins (in general) who
have broken their vow by eating honey, flesh, and the like may again
purify themselves by a ceremony, so here also.--The reason for this
decision is that for those who assume the absence of all expiation on
the part of the Naish*th*ikas no scriptural passage supporting their
view is met with; while those who admit expiation can base their view on
the passage quoted above ('A student who has broken the vow' &c.), which
makes no distinction between Upakurvâ*n*as and Naish*th*ikas. It
therefore is more appropriate to assume the validity of the ceremony for
Naish*th*ikas also. The principle guiding the decision has been
explained in the chapter treating of the means of right knowledge (Pû.
Mî. Sû. I, 3, 8).--On this view the Sm*ri*ti-passage which declares that
there is no expiation for the Naish*th*ika must be explained as aiming
at the origination of weighty effort on the Naish*th*ika's
part.--Similarly in the case of the mendicant and the hermit. The
hermit, when he has broken his vows, undergoes the K*rikkh*ra penance
for twelve nights and then cultivates a place rich in plants. The
mendicant proceeds like the hermit, with the exception of cultivating
the Soma-plant, and undergoes the purifications prescribed for his
state. The rules given by Sm*ri*ti for those cases have to be followed.

scriptural one.
