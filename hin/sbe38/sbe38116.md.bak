non-difference which is preceded by a censure of the perception of
difference, 'By the mind alone it is to be perceived, there is in it no
diversity. He who perceives therein any diversity goes from death to
death' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 19). Others also ('By knowing the enjoyer, the
enjoyed, and the ruler, everything has been declared to be threefold,
and this is Brahman,' Svet. Up. I, 12)

record in their text that the entire world, characterised by enjoyers,
things to be enjoyed, and a ruler, has Brahman for its true nature.--But
as among the scriptural passages referring to Brahman, there are some
which represent it as having a form, and others teaching that it is
devoid of form, how can it be asserted that Brahman is devoid of form,
and not also the contrary?--To this question the next Sûtra replies.
