20\. Thus in other cases also, on account of the connexion (of
particulars with one and the same vidyâ).

We read in the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka (V, 5), 'The true is Brahman,' and,
further on, 'Now what is the true, that is the Âditya, the person that
dwells in yonder orb, and the person in the right eye.' Having thus
declared the different abodes of that true Brahman with reference to the
gods and with reference to the body, and having, in what follows,
identified its body with the sacred syllables (bhû*h*, &c.), the text
teaches its two secret names (upanishad), 'Its secret name is ahar' with
reference to the gods; and 'its secret name is aham' with reference to
the body.--A doubt here arises whether these two secret names are both
to be applied to the deva-abode of Brahman as well as to its bodily
abode, or only one name to each.

The above Sûtra maintains the pûrvapaksha view. Just as certain
particulars though recorded elsewhere are yet

to be combined with the Sâ*nd*ilya-vidyâ, so we have to proceed in other
cases also, as e.g. the one under discussion, because the particulars
mentioned are all connected with one vidyâ. The vidyâ of the True with
its double reference to the Devas and to the body is one only, as we
infer from the fact of its having one exordium only ('The true is
Brahman'), and from the way in which the text interconnects Âditya and
the person in the eye. Why then should an attribute belonging to one of
the latter not belong to the other also? For, to quote an analogous
case, certain rules of life which are prescribed for a teacher--as e.g.
having a following of pupils--remain equally valid whether the teacher
be in a village or in a wood. For these reasons both secret names
equally belong to the Âditya as well as to the person within the eye.
This view the next Sûtra refutes.
