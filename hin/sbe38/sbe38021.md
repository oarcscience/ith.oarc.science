20\. And on account of the two latter (i.e. going and returning) being
connected with their Self (i.e. the agent), (the soul is of atomic
size).

We admit that 'passing out' might possibly be attributed to the soul
even if it does not move, viz. if that expression be taken to mean the
soul's ceasing to be the ruler of the body, in consequence of the
results of its former actions having become exhausted; just as somebody
when ceasing to be the ruler of a village may be said to 'go out.' But
the two latter activities, viz. going and returning, are not possible in
the ease of something which does not move; for they are both connected
with the own Self (of the agent), going (and coming back) being
activities abiding in the agent <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md). Now
going and coming are possible for a being that is not of medium size,
only if it is of atomic size. And as going and coming must be taken in
their literal sense, we conclude that the passing out also means nothing
but the soul's actual moving out of the body. For the soul cannot go and
return without first having moved out of the body. Moreover certain
parts of the body are mentioned as the points from which the soul starts
in passing out, viz. in the following passage, 'Either from the eye or
from the skull or from other places of the body (the Self passes out)'
(B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 2). Other passages mention that the embodied soul
goes and comes within the body also; so, for instance, 'He taking with
him those elements of light descends into the heart' B*ri*. Up. IV, 4,
1); 'Having assumed light he again goes to his place' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 3,
11).--Thereby the atomic size of the soul is established as well.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_23"></span>[36:1](sbe38021.htm#fr_23.md) Going is known to be
an activity inherent in the agent, from the fact of its producing
effects inherent in him, such as his conjunction with--or disjunction
from--other things.
