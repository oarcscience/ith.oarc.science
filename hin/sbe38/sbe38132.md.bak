*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

29\. Or else (the relation of the two is to be conceived) in the manner
stated above.

Or else the relation of the two has to be conceived in the manner
suggested by Sûtra 25. For if the bondage of the soul is due to
Nescience only, final release is possible. But if the soul is really and
truly bound--whether the soul be considered as a certain condition or
state of the highest Self as suggested in Sûtra 27, or as a part of the
highest Self as suggested in Sûtra 28--its real bondage cannot be done
away with, and thus the scriptural doctrine of final release becomes
absurd.--Nor, finally, can it be said that *S*ruti equally teaches
difference and non-difference. For non-difference only is what it aims
at establishing; while, when engaged in setting forth something else, it
merely refers to difference as something known from other sources of
knowledge (viz. perception, &c.).--Hence the conclusion stands that the
soul is not different from the highest Self, as explained in Sûtra 25.
