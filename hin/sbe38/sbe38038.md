37\. The absence of restriction is as in the case of perception.

Just as this Self, although free with regard to perception, yet
perceives unrestrictedly what is unpleasant as well as what is pleasant,
so we assume that it also brings about what is unpleasant as well as
what is pleasant.--The objection that in the act of perception also the
soul is not free because it depends on the employment of the causes of
perception (i.e. the sense-organs), we invalidate by the remark that the
use of the causes of perception is merely to present the objects of
perception, that however in the act of perception the soul because
endowed with intelligence does not depend on anything else <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32).--Moreover in actions also the soul is not
absolutely free, as it depends on differences of place, time, and
efficient causes. But an agent does not cease to be so because he
requires assistance. A cook remains the agent in the action of cooking
although he requires fuel, water, and so on. The presence of a plurality
of cooperating factors is therefore not opposed to the activity of the
soul unrestrictedly extending to actions productive of pleasant as well
as unpleasant results.
