<p>44. On account of the majority of indicatory marks (the fire-altars built of mind, &amp;c. do not form elements of any act); for this (i.e. the indicatory</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_260"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 260</FONT></A></p>  
<p>mark) is stronger (than the general subject-matter); this also (has been explained in the P&ucirc;. M&icirc;. S&ucirc;tras).</p>  
<p>In the Agnirahasya of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyins, in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a beginning 'for in the beginning indeed this was not existent,' we read with reference to mind (manas),' It saw thirty-six thousand shining fire-altars, belonging to itself, made of mind, built of mind.' And, further on, the text makes similar statements about other fanciful fire-altars built of speech, built of breath, built of sight, built of hearing, built of work, built of fire.--A doubt here arises whether these fire-altars built of mind and so on are connected with the act (i.e. the construction of the fire-altar made of bricks), arid supplementary to it, or whether they are independent, constituting a mere vidy&acirc;.</p>  
<p>Against the prima facie view that those agnis are connected with the sacrificial act under whose heading the text records them, the S&ucirc;tra maintains their independence, 'on account of the majority of indicatory marks.' For we meet in that Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a with a number of indicatory marks confirming that those agnis constitute a mere vidy&acirc;; cp, e.g. the following passages: 'Whatever these beings conceive in their minds, that is a means for those fire-altars,' and 'All beings always pile up those fire-altars for him who thus knows, even when he sleeps,' and so on&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.--And that indicatory marks (li&#7749;ga) are of greater force than the leading subject-matter (prakara<I>n</I>a) has been explained in the P&ucirc;rva M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>s&acirc; (III, 3, 14).</p>
