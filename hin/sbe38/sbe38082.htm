<p>6. (Should it be said that the souls are not enveloped by water) on account of this not being stated by scripture, we refute the objection on the ground of those who perform ish<I>t</I>is, &amp;c., being understood.</p>  
<p>Well, let it be granted that, on account of question and answer, water, passing through the forms of <I>s</I>raddh&acirc;, &amp;c., may in the fifth oblation obtain the shape of man. But still we cannot allow that the souls when moving from one body into another are enveloped by water. For this is not directly stated by scripture, there being in the whole passage no word referring to the souls, while there are words referring to water. Hence the assertion that the soul goes enveloped by water is unfounded.--This objection is invalid, we reply, 'on account of those who perform ish<I>t</I>is, &amp;c., being understood.' For in the passage beginning 'But they who living in a village practise sacrifices, works of public utility and alms, they go to the smoke' (V, 3, 10), it is said that those who perform ish<I>t</I>is reach, on the road of the fathers leading through smoke. &amp;c.. the moon, 'From ether they go to the moon; that is Soma, the king.' Now these same persons are meant in the passage about the five fires also, as we conclude from the equality of scriptural statement in the passage, 'In that fire the devas offer</p>

From that oblation rises Soma the king&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' To those&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (persons who have performed ish<I>t</I>is, &amp;c.) water is supplied in the shape of the materials employed to perform the agnihotra dar<I>s</I>ap&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa and other sacrifices, viz. sour milk, milk, &amp;c., which substances, as consisting mostly of water, may directly be considered as water. Of these, when offered in the &acirc;havan&icirc;ya, the subtle parts assume the form of an ap&ucirc;rva resulting from the oblation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and attach themselves to the performer of the sacrifice. Then (when the sacrificer dies) the priests offer his body, with the funeral ceremonies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, into the crematory fire, with the mantra, '(may) he (go) to the heavenly world, sv&acirc;h&acirc;.' Then the water forming the oblation--which has connected with deeds resulting from faith&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>--having assumed the form of an ap&ucirc;rva envelops the souls of those who had performed the sacrifices, and leads them up to the heavenly world to receive their reward.--In accordance with the preceding interpretation scripture says in the agnihotra chapter also--in the complementary passage constituting the reply to the six questions--that the two agnihotra-obligations go up to the other world in order to originate the fruit (of the work of the sacrificer), 'Those two oblations when offered go up, &amp;c.' (<I>S</I>at. Br. XI, 6, 2, 6).--Hence we conclude that the</p>

<p>souls, when going to the enjoyment of the fruits of their works, are enveloped by the water of which the oblations consist&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>But how can it be maintained that those who perform sacrifices, &amp;c., go to the enjoyment of the fruit of their works, considering that scripture declares them when having reached the moon--by the path leading through smoke, &amp;c.--to become food, 'That is Soma the king; that is the food of the gods; the gods do eat it' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. V, 10, 4); and the corresponding passage, 'Having reached the moon they become food, and then the Devas feed on them there as sacrificers feed on Soma as it increases and decreases' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. VI, 2, 16)? If, in accordance with these passages, they are eaten by the gods as by tigers, &amp;c., it is not possible that they should enjoy the fruit of their deeds.--To this the following S&ucirc;tra replies.</p>

Now, as that something is, in the passage about the road of the fathers, the <I>g</I>&icirc;vas of those who have performed ish<I>t</I>is, &amp;c., we conclude that by the <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; also, from which in the other passage the moon is said to rise, those <I>g</I>&icirc;vas are meant, or, properly speaking, the subtle body of water which envelops those <I>g</I>&icirc;vas.--Dh&ucirc;m&acirc;div&acirc;kye pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;gniv&acirc;kye <I>k</I>a somara<I>g</I>atvapr&acirc;pti<I>s</I>rava<I>n</I>&acirc;vi<I>s</I>esh&acirc;d ish<I>t</I>&acirc;dik&acirc;ri<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> <I>s</I>raddh&acirc;<I>s</I>abdit&acirc;dbhir vesh<I>th</I>it&acirc; dyuloka<I>m</I> y&acirc;nt&icirc;ti bh&acirc;t&icirc;ty artha<I>h</I>. &Acirc;n.

<P><A NAME="fn_79"></A><A HREF="sbe38082.htm#fr_79">110:1</A> <I>S</I>a&#7749;kara's attempts to render plausible the interpretation of <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; by 'water,' and to base thereon the doctrine of the souls when going to a new body being enveloped by a subtle involucrum of water (and the other elements contained therein) are, of course, altogether artificial. I do not, however, see that he can be taxed with inconsistency (as he is by Deussen, p. 408). Sraddh&acirc; is to him in the first place the gross water which constitutes the chief material employed in the sacrifices; in the second place the ap&ucirc;rva which results from the sacrifice, and which is imagined to consist of the subtle parts of the water whose gross parts have been consumed by the sacrificial fire. These subtle parts attach themselves to the soul, accompany it as an involucrum when it goes to another world, and form the base of any new body which the soul may have to assume in accordance with its previous deeds.</P>
