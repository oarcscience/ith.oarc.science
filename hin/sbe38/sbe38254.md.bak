*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

45\. (They are) the work of the priest, this is the view of Au*d*ulomi;
since for that (i.e. the entire sacrificial work) he is feed.

The assertion that the meditations on subordinate members of the
sacrifice are the work of the sacrificer is unfounded. They rather are
the work of the priest, as the teacher Au*d*ulomi thinks. For the priest
is rewarded for the work together with its subordinate members; and the
meditations on the udgîtha and so on fall within the performance of the
work since they belong to the sphere of that to which the person
entitled (viz. the lord of the sacrifice) is entitled. Hence they are to
be carried out by the priests only, the case being analogous to that of
the restrictive rule as to the work to be performed by means of the
godohana vessel. In agreement herewith scripture declares the udgât*ri*
to be the agent in knowledge, in the following passage, 'Him Vaka
Dâlbhya knew. He was the udgât*ri* of the Naimishîya-sacrificers' (*Kh*.
Up. I. 2, 13). With reference to the circumstance noted by the
pûrvapakshin that scripture states the fruit to belong to the agent, we
remark that this makes no difference: For with the exception of cases
expressly stated the priest cannot be connected with the sacrifice since
he subserves the purposes (acts for) another (viz. the lord of the
sacrifice).
