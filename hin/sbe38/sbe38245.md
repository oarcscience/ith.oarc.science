*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

36\. But also (persons standing) between (are qualified for knowledge);
for that is seen (in scripture).

A doubt arises whether persons in want who do not possess means, &c.,
and therefore are not able to enter one or the other of the â*s*ramas.,
standing between as it were, are qualified for knowledge or not.--They
are not qualified, the pûrvapakshin maintains. For we have ascertained
that the works incumbent on the â*s*ramas are the cause of knowledge,
and those persons have no opportunity to perform those works.--To this
the Sûtrakâra replies. 'But also between.' Even a person who because he
does not belong to an â*s*rama stands between, as it were, is qualified
for knowledge. 'For that is seen.' For we meet with scriptural passages
declaring that persons of that class--such as Raikva and the daughter of
Va*k*aknu--possessed the knowledge of Brahman (*Kh*. Up. IV, 1; B*ri*.
Up. III, 6, 8).
