*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

32\. The works of the â*s*ramas (are incumbent on him) also (who does
not desire release); because they are enjoined.

Under Sûtra 26 it has been proved that the work's enjoined on the
â*s*ramas are means of knowledge. Now we will consider whether those
works have to be performed also by him who does not desire final release
and therefore takes his stand on his â*s*rama merely without wishing for
knowledge--Here the pûrvapakshin maintains that as the works incumbent
on the â*s*ramas are enjoined as means of knowledge by the passage, 'Him
the Brâhma*n*as seek to know by the study of the Veda' &c., the works of
permanent obligation are not to be performed by him who, not desirous of
knowledge, wishes for some other fruit. Or else they are to be performed
by him also; but then they cannot be means of knowledge, since it would
be contradictory to attribute to them a permanent and a non-permanent
connexion. <span id="fr_198"></span>[1](#fn_198)

Against this conclusion the Sûtrakâra remarks that the works of
permanent obligation are to be performed by

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

him only who, not desirous of release, takes his stand on the â*s*ramas
merely, because they are enjoined by texts such 'as long as his life
lasts he is to offer the agnihotra.' For to such texts no excessive
weight must be ascribed.--The next Sûtra replies to the objection raised
above in the words, 'but then they cannot be means of knowledge.'

think that because they enjoin the 'nityatâ' of certain works, other
passages may not enjoin the same works as mere means of knowledge.
