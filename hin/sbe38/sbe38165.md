22\. (Scripture) also declares that.

Scripture moreover contains a distinct intimation that the attributes
under discussion are to be held apart. We read, *Kh*. Up. I, 8, 5, 'The
form of that person is the same as the form of the other person, the
joints of the one are the joints of the other, the name of the one is
the name of the other.'--But how does this passage convey the desired
intimation?--By expressly transferring the attributes of the person
within the sun to the person within the eye; for this express transfer
shows that the text looks upon the attributes of the two as separated by
the difference of abode and therefore not to be combined (unless
specially enjoined to be so combined).--The conclusion therefore is that
the two secret names are to be held apart.
