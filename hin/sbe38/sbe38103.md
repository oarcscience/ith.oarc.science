*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

27\. From the yoni a (new) body (springs).

Then, subsequently to the soul having been in conjunction with a person
of generative power, generation takes place, and a body is produced in
which the soul can enjoy the fruits of that remainder of works which
still attaches to it. This scripture declares in the passage, 'Those
whose conduct has been good,' &c. From this, also, it appears that the
souls to which a remainder clings, when descending and becoming rice
plants, and so on, do not enter into the state of forming the body of
those plants with its attendant pleasure and pain, but are 'born as
plants' in so far only as they enter into conjunction with them.
