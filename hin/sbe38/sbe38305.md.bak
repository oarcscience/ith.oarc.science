4\. (They are) conductors, this being indicated.

With regard to those beginning with light a doubt arises whether they
are marks of the road, or places of enjoyment, or leaders of the
travelling souls.--The first possible view of the question is that light
and so on are marks of the road, because the instruction has that
character. For as in ordinary life a man wishing to go to a village or a
town is told, 'Go from here to that hill, from there to a fig-tree, from
that to a river, from that to a village; after that you will reach the
town;' so here the text also says, 'from light to day, from day to the
waxing half of the month,' &c.--Or else light and so on may be viewed as
places of enjoyment. For the text connects Agni and so on with the word
'world'; 'He comes to the world of Agni,' &c. Now the term 'world' is
used to denote places of enjoyment of living beings, as when we say,
'The world of men; the world of the Fathers; the world of the gods.' A
Brâhma*n*a passage also says, 'They remain attached to the worlds which
consist of day and night' (Sat. Brâ. X, 2, 6, 8). Therefore light and
the rest are not conductors. Moreover, they cannot be conductors because
they are without intelligence. For in ordinary life intelligent men only
are appointed by the king to conduct travellers over difficult roads.

To all this we reply as follows. They must be conductors, because the
text indicates this. For we read, 'From the moon to the lightning; there
a person that is not a man leads them to Brahman;' which shows their
conductorship to be something settled. Should it be objected that this
last sentence exhausts itself in conveying its own purport <span
id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_227.md); we say No; for the attribute ('that is
not a man') has only the meaning of excluding his previously established
humanity. Only if in the case of the light and the rest personal
conductors are settled, and those of human nature, it is appropriate to
use the attribute

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'amânava,' to the
end of excluding this (previously established) humanity <span
id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_228.md).

But mere indication has no force, as there is nothing to prove (that
there must be such personal conductors).--To this objection the next
Sûtra replies.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[387:1](sbe38305.htm#fr_227.md) And has not the
additional power of indicating, i.e. enabling us to infer that also the
beings previously mentioned are 'leaders' of the soul.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[388:1](sbe38305.htm#fr_228.md) Why should it be
specially stated that this 'conducting person' is amânava? Only, because
it is a settled matter that the previously mentioned beings are also
'conducting persons,' and at the same time 'mânava.' The last clause
therefore does not only directly teach that a person conducts the souls
to Brahman, but at the same time 'indicates' that the beings mentioned
before in connexion with the road are also 'personal conductors.'
