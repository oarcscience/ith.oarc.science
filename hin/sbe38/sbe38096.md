*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

20\. And on account of observation.

It is, moreover, observed that out of the four classes of organic
beings--viviparous animals, oviparous animals, animals springing from
heat, and beings springing from germs (plants)--the two latter classes
are produced without sexual intercourse, so that in their case no regard
is had to the number of oblations. The same may therefore take place in
other cases also.--But, an objection may here be raised, scripture
speaks of those beings as belonging to three classes only, because there
are three modes of origin only; 'That which springs from an egg, that
which springs from a living being, that which springs from a germ'
(*Kh*. Up. VI, 3, 1). How then can it be maintained that there are four
classes?--To this objection the next Sutra replies.
