*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

18\. As (scripture where speaking of the rinsing of the mouth with
water) makes a reference to an act (established by Sm*ri*ti), (that act
is not enjoined by *S*ruti, but rather) the new (act of meditation on
the water viewed as the dress of prâ*n*a).

The *Kh*andogas as well as the Vâ*g*asaneyins record, in the colloquy of
the prâ*n*as, that the food of Breath comprizes everything even unto
dogs and birds, and that water is its dress. To this the *Kh*andogas
add, 'Therefore when going to eat food they surround it before and after
with water' (*Kh*. Up. V, 2, 2). And the Vâ*g*asaneyins add (B*ri*. Up.
VI, 1, 14), '*S*rotriyas who know this rinse the mouth with water when
they are going to eat and rinse the mouth with water after they have
eaten, thinking that thereby they make the breath dressed. Therefore a
man knowing this is to rinse the mouth with water when going to eat and
after having eaten; he thereby makes that breath dressed.'--These texts
intimate two things, rinsing of the mouth and meditation on the breath
as dressed. The doubt then arises whether the texts enjoin both these
matters, or only the rinsing of the mouth, or only the meditation on
breath as dressed.

The pûrvapakshin maintains that the text enjoins both, since the one as
well as the other is intimated by the text, and since both matters not
being settled by any other means of knowledge are worthy of being
enjoined by the Veda.--Or else, he says, the rinsing of the mouth only
is enjoined, since with reference to the latter only the text exhibits
the particular injunctive verbal form ('he is to rinse'). In this latter
case the mention made in the text of the meditation on breath as dressed
has merely the purpose of glorifying the act of rinsing.

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

To this we make the following reply.--The rinsing of the mouth cannot
possibly be enjoined by the quoted passages 'since they merely contain
references to an act,' i.e. since they merely contain remarks concerning
the purificatory act of rinsing the mouth which is known from and
settled by Sm*ri*ti.--But are not the very *S*ruti-passages under
discussion to be looked upon as the fundamental texts on which the
Sm*ri*ti-injunctions regarding the rinsing of the mouth are based?--This
is not possible, we reply, since the *S*ruti and Sm*ri*ti-passages refer
to different matters. All the Sm*ri*ti-passages enjoin the act of
rinsing the mouth only in so far as it purifies man; while the quoted
*S*ruti texts which occur in prâ*n*a-vidyâs, if enjoining the rinsing of
the mouth at all, enjoin it with reference to the knowledge of prâ*n*a.
And a *S*ruti-passage cannot constitute the basis of a Sm*ri*ti-passage
referring to an altogether different matter. Nor can it be maintained
that the *S*ruti-passage enjoins some altogether new rinsing of the
mouth connected with the prâ*n*a-vidyâ, as we recognise the rinsing
mentioned in *S*ruti as the ordinary rinsing performed by men for the
sake of purification.--The preceding argumentation already precludes the
alternative of two matters being enjoined, which would moreover lead to
a so-called split of the sentence.--We therefore conclude that the
text--with reference to the rinsing of the mouth before and after eating
which is enjoined by Sm*ri*ti-enjoins (by means of the passage,
'thinking that thereby they make the breath dressed') a new mental
resolve with regard to the water used for rinsing purposes, viz. that
that water should act as a means for clothing the prâ*n*a. The statement
about the clothing of the prâ*n*a cannot (as suggested by the
pûrvapakshin) be taken as a glorification of the act of rinsing the
mouth; for in the first place the act of rinsing is not enjoined in the
Vedic passage <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_139.md), and in the second
place we apprehend that the passage itself conveys an injunction, viz.
of the mental

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

resolve to provide clothing for the prâ*n*a. Nor must the objection be
raised that in that case two purposes are admitted for the one act of
rinsing the mouth, viz. the purpose of purification and the purpose of
providing the prâ*n*a with clothing. For we have actually to do not with
one action, but with two separate actions. For one action is the rinsing
of the mouth which serves the purpose of purifying man, and another
action is the mental resolve that that water should serve the purpose of
clothing the prâ*n*a. Similarly the preceding passage, 'Whatever there
is, even unto dogs, &c., that is thy food,' does not enjoin the
promiscuous use of food of all kinds--for that would be contrary to
scripture and impossible in itself--but merely enjoins the meditation on
all food as food of the prâ*n*a. We therefore conclude that also the
passage, 'Water is thy dress," which forms the immediate continuation of
the passage last quoted does not enjoin the act of rinsing the mouth but
merely the act of meditating on the rinsing-water as constituting the
dress of the prâ*n*a.

Moreover the mere present-form, 'they rinse the mouth with water,' has
no enjoining force.--But also in the passage, 'They think that thereby
they make the breath dressed,' we have a mere present-form without
injunctive power (and yet you maintain that that passage conveys an
injunction)!--True; but as necessarily one of the two must be
enjoined <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_140.md), we assume, on the ground
of what the text says about the making of a dress, that what is enjoined
is the meditation on water being the dress of prâ*n*a; for this is
something 'new,' i.e. not established by other means of knowledge <span
id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_141.md). The rinsing of the mouth with water, on
the other hand, is already established by other means (i.e. Sm*ri*ti),
and therefore need not be enjoined again.--The argument founded

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

by the pûrvapakshin on the circumstance that, in the B*ri*. Up., the
verb 'to rinse' is found in the injunctive form ('therefore a man, &c.,
is to rinse'), is already refuted by our showing that the act of rinsing
the mouth is not a new one (and therefore requires no Vedic injunction).

For the very reason that the text does not aim at enjoining the rinsing
of the mouth, the Kâ*n*vas (in their recension of the B*ri*. Up.)
conclude the chapter with the clause, 'They think,' &c., and do not add
the concluding clause of the Mâdhyandinas, 'Therefore a man,' &c. From
this we have to conclude that what is enjoined in the text of the
Mâdhyandinas also is 'the knowledge of that,' i.e. the knowledge of the
water being the dress of the previously mentioned prâ*n*a.--Nor finally
can it be maintained that in one place (i.e. the Madhyandina-*s*âkha)
the rinsing of the mouth is enjoined, and in other places the knowledge
of water as the dress of prâ*n*a; for the introductory passage, 'Water
is the dress,' is the same everywhere.--We are therefore entitled to
conclude that what is enjoined in all *S*âkhâs is the cognition of water
being the dress of the prâ*n*a.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_139"></span>[212:1](sbe38161.htm#fr_139.md) A glorifying
arthavâda-passage would be in its place only if it were preceded by some
injunction; for the glorification of certain acts is meant to induce men
to comply with the injunctions concerning those acts.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[213:1](sbe38161.htm#fr_140.md) Because otherwise
we should have only arthavâdas. But arthavâdas have a meaning only in so
far as connected with an injunction.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[213:2](sbe38161.htm#fr_141.md) The above
argumentation avails itself of the Sûtra, putting a new construction on
it.--Tarhi dvayor avidheyatvam ity
