2\. And for the same reason all (sense-organs) (follow) after (mind).

'Therefore he whose light has gone out comes to a new birth with his
senses merged in the mind' (Pr. Up. III, 9); this passage states that
all senses without difference are merged in the mind. 'For the same
reason,' i.e. because there also as in the case of speech, it is
observed that the eye and so on discontinue their functions, while the
mind together with its functions persists, and because the organs

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

themselves cannot be absorbed, and because the text admits of that
interpretation; we conclude that the different organs follow after, i.e.
are merged in, the mind only as far as their functions arc
concerned.--As all organs <span id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_219.md) without
difference are merged in the mind, the special mention made of speech
(in Sûtra 1) must be viewed as made in agreement with the special
example referred to by scripture, 'Speech is merged in mind.'
