9\. And for this very same reason (the released soul is) without another
lord.

For this very same reason, i.e. owing to the fact of the will of the
released person not being barren, he who knows has no other lord over
himself. For not even an ordinary person when forming wishes will, if he
can help it, wish himself to be subject to another master. And scripture
also declares this when saying, 'Those who depart from hence, after
having discovered the Self and those true desires, for them there is
freedom in all worlds' (*Kh*. Up. VIII, 1, 6).
