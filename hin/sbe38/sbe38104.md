### SECOND PÂDA.

REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!

1\. In the intermediate place there is (a real) creation; for
(scripture) says (that).

In the preceding pâda we have set forth, with reference to the knowledge
of the five fires, the various stages of the soul's passing through the
sa*m*sâra. We shall now set forth the soul's different states (waking,
dreaming, &c.)--Scripture says (B*ri*. Up. IV, 3, 9; 10), 'When he falls
asleep--; there are no chariots in that state, no horses, no roads, but
he himself creates chariots, horses, and roads,' &c.--Here a doubt
arises whether the creation thus taking place in dreams is a real one
(pâramârthika) like the creation seen in the waking state, or whether it
consists of illusion (mâyâ).--The pûrvapakshin maintains that 'in the
intermediate place (or state) there is (a real) creation.' By
intermediate place we have to understand the place of dreams, in which
latter sense the word is used in the Veda, 'There is a third
intermediate state, the state of dreams' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 3, 9). That
place is called the intermediate place because it lies there where the
two worlds, or else the place of waking and the place of bliss (deep
sleep), join. In that intermediate place the creation must be real;
because scripture, which is authoritative, declares it to be so, 'He
creates chariots, horses, roads,' &c. We, moreover, infer this from the
concluding clause, 'He indeed is the maker' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 3, 10).
