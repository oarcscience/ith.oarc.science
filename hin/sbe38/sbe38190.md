47\. But (the agnis rather constitute) a vidyâ, on account of the
assertion (made by the text).

The word 'but' sets aside the pûrvapaksha.--The agnis built of mind and
so on are to be viewed not as complementary to a sacrificial action, but
as independent and constituting a vidyâ of their own. For the text
expressly asserts that 'they are built of knowledge (vidyâ) only,' and
that 'by knowledge they are built for him who thus knows.'
