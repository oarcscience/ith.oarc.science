*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

36\. (The same thing follows) from the express denial of other
(existences).

Having thus refuted the arguments of the pûrvapakshin, the Sûtrakâra in
conclusion strengthens his view by a further reason. A great number of
Vedic passages--which, considering the context in which they stand,
cannot be explained otherwise--distinctly deny that there exists
anything apart from Brahman; 'He indeed is below; I am below; the Self
is below' (*Kh*. Up. VII, 25, 1; 2); 'Whosoever looks for anything
elsewhere than in the Self was abandoned by everything' (B*ri*. Up. II,
4, 6); 'Brahman

alone is all this' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'The Self is all this' (*Kh*.
Up. VII, 25, 2): 'In it there is no diversity' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 19);
'He to whom there is nothing superior, from whom there is nothing
different' (*S*vet. Up. III, 9); 'This is the Brahman without cause and
without effect, without anything inside or outside' (B*ri*. Up. II, 5,
19).--And that there is no other Self within the highest Self, follows
from that scriptural passage which teaches Brahman to be within
everything (B*ri*. Up. II, 5, 19).
