*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

17\. For (there is) also (a class of good works) other than this,
according to some. (There is agreement) of both (teachers) (as to the
fate of those works.)

'For also one other than this,' i.e. there is also a class of good works
different from works of permanent obligation, viz. those good works
which are performed with a view to a fruit. Of those latter works the
passage quoted above from some *S*âkhâ ('His friends enter on his good
works') teaches the application. And first of those works Sûtra 14
teaches that, in the same way as evil deeds, they do not cling to the
doer or else are destroyed. Both teachers, *G*aimini as well as
Bâdarâya*n*a, are agreed that such works, undertaken for the fulfilment
of some special wish, do not contribute towards the origination of true
knowledge.
