8\. Hereby air (also) is explained.

The present Sûtra extends the reasoning concerning ether to the air of
which the ether is the abode. The different views about air also are to
be arranged in an analogous manner. The pûrvapakshin maintains that the
air is not a product, because it is not mentioned in that chapter of the
*Kh*ândogya which treats of the origination of things. The opposite
opinion is, that the air is mentioned in the parallel chapter of the
Taittirîyaka ('from the ether sprang the air'). The two scriptural
passages being of a conflicting nature, the pûrvapakshin maintains that
the passage which declares the air to have originated must be taken in a
secondary sense; firstly on account of the impossibility (of the literal
sense being adopted), as shown (in the adhikara*n*a treating of the
ether); secondly on account of that passage which denies that it ever
sets, 'Vâyu (the air) is the deity that never sets' (B*ri*. Up. I, 5,
22); and thirdly on account of those passages which declare it to be
immortal. The final opinion on the other hand is, that air is a product;
in the first place because this conclusion is conformable to the general
tendency of scripture; and, in the second place, because it is generally
admitted that whatever

is divided is an effect. The denial of its ever setting refers to the
lower knowledge (aparâ vidyâ <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15)) and is
merely a relative one, Vâyu not setting in the same way as fire, &c. The
statement as to the immortality, &c. of air has already received its
reply (in the adhikara*n*a treating of the ether). Here it maybe asked
why, ether and air being equally mentioned and not mentioned in the
chapters treating of the origin of the world, one adhikara*n*a is not
considered to suffice for both, and why instead of that there is made a
formal extension of the former reasoning to the latter case, although
there is no difference between the two cases. To this we reply that
there is indeed some reason for the question; that, however, the formal
extension is made for the purpose of removing any doubts which might
possibly be engendered in the minds of slow-witted people by mere
words <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16). For as, in the
Sa*m*vargavidyâ and other passages, the glory of Vâyu is referred to as
an object of worship; and as scripture says that he never sets, &c.,
some men might think that he is eternal.
