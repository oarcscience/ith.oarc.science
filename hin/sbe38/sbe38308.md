*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

7\. To the effected (Brahman) (the souls are led); (thus opines) Bâdari;
because going to him is possible.

With regard to the passage, 'He leads them to Brahman.'

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

the doubt arises whether that person leads the souls to the effected,
lower, Brahman, or to the highest, non-modified, chief Brahman.--Whence
the doubt?--Because the (ambiguous) word Brahman is used, and because
scripture speaks of going.--The opinion of the teacher Bâdari is that
the person, who is not a man, leads them to the lower, qualified,
effected Brahman; because it is possible to go to that. For the effected
Brahman which occupies a definite place can be the goal of a journey.
With the highest Brahman, on the other hand, we cannot connect the ideas
of one who goes, or object of going, or act of going; for that Brahman
is present everywhere and is the inner Self of all.
