47\. There is the injunction of something else cooperating (towards
knowledge) (which is) a third thing (with regard to bâlya and
pâ*nd*itya), (which injunction is given) for the case (of perfect
knowledge not yet having arisen) to him who is such (i.e. the
Sa*m*nyâsin possessing knowledge); as in the case of injunctions and the
like.

'Therefore let a Brâhma*n*a after he has done with learning wish to
stand by a childlike state; and after he has done with the childlike
state and learning (he is, or, may be) a Muni; and after he has done
with what constitutes Muniship and non-Muniship (he is, or, may be) a
Brâhma*n*a' (B*ri*. Up. III, 5). With reference to this passage a doubt
arises whether it enjoins the state of a Muni or not.--The pûrvapakshin
maintains that it does not enjoin it, since the injunction is completed
with the clause, 'Let him wish to stand by a childlike state.' The
following clause 'then a Muni' contains no verbal form of injunctive
force and therefore must be viewed as a mere anuvâda (making a remark
concerning the state of a Muni which is already established). Should it
be asked how this conclusion is reached, we reply that Muniship is
established by the clause 'having done with learning' (which forms part
of the injunctive portion of the passage), as 'Muni' and 'learned man'
both denote knowledge <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_203.md). It is,
moreover, clear also that the last clause,' and after he has done with
what constitutes Muniship and non-Muniship (he is) a Brâhma*n*a,' does
not enjoin the condition of a Brâhma*n*a, as that state is previously
established (independently of that clause); but the words 'then a
Brâhma*n*a' are a mere glorificatory anuvâda. Now as the words 'then a
Muni' show an analogous form of enunciation (to the clause 'then a
Brâhma*n*a'), they also can embody a glorificatory anuvâda only.

To all this we reply as follows. 'There is an injunction of something
else which co-operates.' The passage must be understood as enjoining the
state of a Muni--which co-operates towards knowledge--in the same way as
it enjoins learning and a childlike state, because that state is
something new (not enjoined before).--But it has been said above that
the word 'learning' already intimates Muniship!--This, we reply, does
not invalidate our case since the word 'muni' denotes (not only
knowledge as the term 'learned man' does, but) pre-eminence of
knowledge, on the ground as well of its etymology from 'manana,' i.e.
thinking, as of common use, shown in such phrases as 'I am the Vyâsa of
Munis also.'--But the term 'Muni' is also seen to denote the last order
of life; cp. passages such as 'Householdership, studentship, the order
of Munis, the order of hermits in the woods.'--Yes, but it has not that
meaning exclusively, as we see that it does not apply to phrases such as
'Valmîki is the foremost among Munis.' In the passage quoted (about the
four orders) the last order is referred to, by the term 'Muni,' because
there it stands in proximity to the other orders of life, and, as the
state of the Ascetic is the only one which remains (after we have
assigned the three other terms to the stages of life clearly denoted by
them), the last order may be denoted 'mauna' because knowledge is its
principal requirement.--We therefore conclude that in the passage under
discussion the state of the Muni--whose characteristic mark is
pre-eminence of knowledge--is enjoined as something third--with regard
to the childlike state and learning.--Against the objection that the
injunction terminates with the childlike state, we remark that all the
same we must view the Muniship also as something enjoined, as it is
something new, so that we have to supplement the clause as follows:
'then *he is to be* a Muni.' That the state of a Muni is something to be
enjoined, in the same way as the childlike state and 'earning, also
follows from its being referred to as something to be done with (like
bâlya and pâ*nd*itya. It is enjoined 'on him who is such,' i.e. on the
Sa*m*nyâsin possessing knowledge.--How do we know this latter
point?--Because

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

the Sa*m*nyâsin who possesses knowledge forms the topic, as we see from
the preceding passage, 'Having cognized the Self and risen above the
desire for sons, &c., they wander about as mendicants.'--But if the
Sa*m*nyâsin possesses knowledge, pre-eminence of knowledge is already
established thereby; what then is the use of the injunction of
Muniship?--To this the Sûtra replies 'in the case of.' That means: in
the case of pre-eminence of knowledge not being established owing to the
prevailing force of the (erroneous) idea of multiplicity; for that case
the injunction (of Muniship, i.e. of pre-eminence of knowledge) is
given. 'As in the case of injunctions and the like.' With reference to
sacrifices such as are enjoined in the passage, 'He who is desirous of
the heavenly world is to offer the dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa-sacrifice,' the
aggregate of subordinate members, such as the establishment of the
sacred fires, is enjoined as something helpful; similarly in this text
whose topic is knowledge and which therefore does not chiefly aim at
injunction, Muniship is enjoined as something helpful to knowledge.

As thus the order of the ascetic, as distinguished by a childlike state
and so on, is actually established by scripture, for what reason does
the *Kh*ândogya Upanishad wind up with the householder, viz. in the
passage, 'After having received his discharge from his teacher he
settles in his own house,' &c.? For by concluding with the householder,
scripture manifests special regard for him.--To this doubt the next
Sûtra replies.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_203"></span>[322:1](sbe38256.htm#fr_203.md) The state of a
Muni is already enjoined by the clause 'pâ*nd*itya*m* nirvidya;' the
clause 'atha muni*h*,' therefore, may be viewed as an anuvâda (as which
it could not be viewed, if there were no previous injunction of mauna).
