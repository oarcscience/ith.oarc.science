*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

7\. And (they are) minute.

The author of the Sûtras adds another characteristic quality of the
prâ*n*as. The prâ*n*as under discussion must be viewed as minute. By
their minuteness we have to understand subtilty and limited size; but
not atomic size, as otherwise they would be incapable of producing
effects which extend over the whole body. They must be subtle; for if
they were big the persons surrounding a dying man would see them coming
out from the body at the moment of death, as a snake comes out of its
hole. They must be limited; for if they were all-pervading the
scriptural statements as to their passing out of the body, going and
coming, would be contradicted thereby, and it could not be established
that the individual soul is 'the essence of the qualities of that' (i.e.
the manas; cp. II, 3, 29). Should it be said that they may be
all-pervading, but at the same time appear as functions (v*ri*tti) in
the body only, we rejoin that only a function can constitute an
instrument. Whatever effects perception, may it be a function or
something else, just that is an instrument for us. The disagreement is
therefore about a name only, and the assumption of the instruments
(prâ*n*as) being all-pervading is thus purposeless.--Hence we decide
that the prâ*n*as are subtle and of limited size.
