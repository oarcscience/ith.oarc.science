*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5\. By (a nature) like that of Brahman (the soul manifests itself);
(thus) *G*aimini (opines); on account of reference and the rest.

It has been concluded that the clause, 'by its own nature,' means that
the soul manifests itself by its own Self only, not by some other
adventitious character. What has now to be inquired into is the specific
qualities of that nature. Here the Sûtra at first states the opinion of
the teacher *G*aimini. According to him the soul's own nature is 'like
that of Brahman,' i.e. it comprises all the qualities beginning with
freeness from sin and concluding with truthfulness of conception (i.e.
the qualities enumerated in *Kh*. Up. VIII, 7, 1), and also omniscience
and omnipotence; and in this nature the soul manifests itself.--Why
so?--Because this is known from reference <span
id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_232) and the rest. For the reference

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

to certain qualities made in VIII, 7, 1, teaches that the Selfhood of
the Self is such (i.e. such as made up of those qualities).--Again, the
passage, 'He there moves about eating, playing, rejoicing,' shows that
the Self possesses lordly power; so also the passage, 'For him there is
free movement in all worlds' (*Kh*. Up. VIII, 1, 6). And thus also there
is justification for such designations as 'All-knowing; all-powerful.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_232"></span>[408:1](sbe38322.htm#fr_232) The commentators
say that the 'and the rest' of the Sûtra comprises vidhi and
vyapade*s*a, and give the following definitions. <span id="page_409">p.
409</span> Upanyâsa is the reference to something known (established
elsewhere), which reference is made with a view to a vidhi, i.e. the
establishing of something not yet known (upanyâso nâmoddesa*h* sa
*k*â<sup>ऽ</sup>nyatra *gñ*âtasyâ<sup>ऽ</sup>nyavidhânâyânuvâda*h*).
Thus here the qualities--freeness from sin--are referred to as known,
for the purpose of establishing the vidhi, 'That it is which we must
search out.'--The passage, 'He there wanders about,' &c., is a vidhi;
for it teaches what is not already known from elsewhere.--The mentioning
of such qualities as omniscience and omnipotence is vyapade*s*a, i.e.
simple expression of something known without reference to a vidhi.
