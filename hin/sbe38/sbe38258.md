*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

49\. On account of there being injunction of the others also, in the
same way as of the state of a Muni.

As the state of the Muni (Sa*m*nyâsin) and the state of the householder
are enjoined in scripture, so also the two other orders, viz. that of
the hermit, and that of the student. For we have already pointed above
to passages such as Austerity is the second, and to dwell as a student
in the house of a teacher is the third.' As thus the four â*s*ramas are
equally taught by scripture, they are to be gone through equally, either
in the way of option (between them) or in the way of comprehension (of
all of them).--That the Sûtra uses a plural form (of 'the others') when
speaking of two orders only, is due to its having regard either to the
different sub-classes of those two, or to their different duties.
