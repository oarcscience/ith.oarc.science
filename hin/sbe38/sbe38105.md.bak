2\. And some (state the Self to be) the shaper (creator); sons and so on
(being the lovely things which he shapes).

Moreover the members of one *s*âkhâ state that the Self is, in that
intermediate state, the shaper of lovely things, 'He, the person who is
awake in us while we are asleep, shaping one lovely thing after another'
(Ka. Up. II, 5, 8).

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kâma (lovely
things) in this passage means sons, &c., that are so called because they
are beloved.--But may not the term 'kâmâ*h*' denote desires merely?--No,
we reply; the word kâma is here used with reference to sons, &c.; for
those form the general subject of discussion, as we see from some
preceding passages, 'Choose sons and grandsons,' &c., and 'I make thee
the enjoyer of all kâmas' (Ka. Up. I, 1, 23; 24).--And that that shaper
is the highest Self (prâ*gñ*a) we infer from the general subject-matter
and from the complementary sentence. That the highest Self is the
general subject-matter appears from II, 14, 'That which thou seest as
neither this nor that.' And to that highest Self there also refers the
complementary sentence II, 5, 8, 'That indeed is the Bright, that is
Brahman, that alone is called the Immortal. All worlds are contained in
it, and no one goes beyond.'--Now it is admitted that the world
(creation) of our waking state of which the highest Self (prâ*gñ*a) is
the maker is real; hence the world of our dreaming state must likewise
be real. That the same reasoning applies to the waking and the sleeping
state a scriptural passage also declares, 'Here they say: No, this is
the same as the place of waking, for what he sees while awake the same
he sees while asleep' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 3, 14).--Hence the world of dreams
is real.--To this we reply as follows.
