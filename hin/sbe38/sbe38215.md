duties to be performed for the Guru; who after having received his
discharge has settled in his own house, studying his sacred texts in
some sacred spot' (*Kh*. Up. VIII, 15); such passages also show that
those who know the purport of the whole Veda are qualified for
sacrificial action, and that hence knowledge does not independently
bring about a result.--But the expression 'who has read' directly states
only that the Veda is read, not that its purport is understood!--Not so,
we reply. The reading of the Veda extends up to the comprehension of its
purport, as thus the reading has a visible purpose <span
