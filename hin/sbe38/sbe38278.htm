<p>17. For (there is) also (a class of good works) other than this, according to some. (There is agreement) of both (teachers) (as to the fate of those works.)</p>  
<p>'For also one other than this,' i.e. there is also a class of good works different from works of permanent obligation, viz. those good works which are performed with a view to a fruit. Of those latter works the passage quoted above from some <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; ('His friends enter on his good works') teaches the application. And first of those works S&ucirc;tra 14 teaches that, in the same way as evil deeds, they do not cling to the doer or else are destroyed. Both teachers, <I>G</I>aimini as well as B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, are agreed that such works, undertaken for the fulfilment of some special wish, do not contribute towards the origination of true knowledge.</p>
