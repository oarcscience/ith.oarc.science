*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

44\. On account of the majority of indicatory marks (the fire-altars
built of mind, &c. do not form elements of any act); for this (i.e. the
indicatory

mark) is stronger (than the general subject-matter); this also (has been
explained in the Pû. Mî. Sûtras).

In the Agnirahasya of the Vâ*g*asaneyins, in the Brâhma*n*a beginning
'for in the beginning indeed this was not existent,' we read with
reference to mind (manas),' It saw thirty-six thousand shining
fire-altars, belonging to itself, made of mind, built of mind.' And,
further on, the text makes similar statements about other fanciful
fire-altars built of speech, built of breath, built of sight, built of
hearing, built of work, built of fire.--A doubt here arises whether
these fire-altars built of mind and so on are connected with the act
(i.e. the construction of the fire-altar made of bricks), arid
supplementary to it, or whether they are independent, constituting a
mere vidyâ.

Against the prima facie view that those agnis are connected with the
sacrificial act under whose heading the text records them, the Sûtra
maintains their independence, 'on account of the majority of indicatory
marks.' For we meet in that Brâhma*n*a with a number of indicatory marks
confirming that those agnis constitute a mere vidyâ; cp, e.g. the
following passages: 'Whatever these beings conceive in their minds, that
is a means for those fire-altars,' and 'All beings always pile up those
fire-altars for him who thus knows, even when he sleeps,' and so
on <span id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165.md).--And that indicatory marks
(liṅga) are of greater force than the leading subject-matter
(prakara*n*a) has been explained in the Pûrva Mîmâ*m*sâ (III, 3, 14).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_165"></span>[260:1](sbe38187.htm#fr_165.md) For something
which forms part of an act cannot be brought about by something so
indefinite as 'whatever these beings conceive in their minds,' nor can
it be accomplished indifferently at any time by any beings.
