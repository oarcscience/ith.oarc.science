32\. But (Brahman is called a bank &c.) on account of (a certain)
equality.

The word 'but' is meant to set aside the previously established
conclusion.--There can exist nothing different from Brahman, since we
are unable to observe a proof for such existence. That all existences
which have a beginning spring from, subsist through, and return into
Brahman we have already ascertained, and have shown that the effect is
non-different from the cause.--Nor can there exist, apart from Brahman,
something which has no beginning, since scripture affirms that 'Being
only this was

in the beginning, one, without a second.' The promise moreover that
through the cognition of one thing everything will be known, renders it
impossible that there should exist anything different from Brahman.--But
does not the fact that the Self is called a bank, &c. indicate that
there exists something beyond the Self?--No, we reply; the passages
quoted by the pûrvapakshin have no power to prove his conclusion. For
the text only says that the Self is a bank, not that there is something
beyond it. Nor are we entitled to assume the existence of some such
thing, merely to the end of accounting for the Self being called a bank;
for the simple assumption of something unknown is a mere piece of
arbitrariness. If, moreover, the mere fact of the Self being called a
bank implied the existence of something beyond it, as in the case of an
ordinary bank, we should also be compelled to conclude that the Self is
made of earth and stones; which would run counter to the scriptural
doctrine that the Self is not something produced.--The proper
explanation is that the Self is called a bank because it resembles a
bank in a certain respect; as a bank dams back the water and marks the
boundary of contiguous fields, so the Self supports the world and its
boundaries. The Self is thus glorified by the name of bank because it
resembles one.--In the clause quoted above, 'having passed that bank,'
the verb 'to pass' cannot be taken in the sense of 'going beyond,' but
must rather mean 'to reach fully.' In the same way we say of a student,
'he has passed the science of grammar,' meaning thereby that he has
fully mastered it.
