*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

34\. (The statements concerning connexion and difference) are due to
difference of place; in the manner of light and so on.

The present Sûtra refutes the allegation that something different from
Brahman exists, firstly, because things are said to be connected with
Brahman, and secondly, because things are said to be separate from it.
The fact is, that all those statements regarding connexion and
difference are made with a view to difference of place. When the
cognition of difference which is produced by the Selfs connexion with
different places, i.e. with the buddhi and the other limiting adjuncts,
ceases on account of the cessation of those limiting adjuncts
themselves, connexion with the highest Self is metaphorically said to
take place; but that is done with a view to the limiting adjuncts only,
not with a view to any limitation on the part of the Self.--In the same
way, all statements regarding difference have reference to the
difference of Brahman's limiting adjuncts only, not to any difference
affecting Brahman's own nature.--All this

is analogous to the case of light and the like. For the light of the sun
or the moon also is differentiated by its connexion with limiting
adjuncts, and is, on account of these adjuncts, spoken of as divided,
and, when the adjuncts are removed, it is said to enter into connexion
(union). Other instances of the effect of limiting adjuncts are
furnished by the ether entering into connexion with the eyes of needles
and the like.
