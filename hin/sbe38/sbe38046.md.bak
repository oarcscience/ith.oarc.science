45\. Moreover it is so stated in Sm*ri*ti.

In the Î*s*varagitâs (Bhagavad-gîtâ) also it is said that the soul is a
part of the Lord, 'an eternal part of me becomes the individual soul in
the world of life' (Bha. Gî. XV, 7). With regard to the assertion made
above, viz. that in ordinary life the relation of ruler and ruled is
known to hold good in the case of master and servant &c. only, we remark
that, although that may be the case in ordinary life, we ascertain from
scripture that the relation of part and whole and that of ruler and
ruled may go together. Nor is there anything contradictory in assuming
that the Lord who is provided with superexcellent limiting adjuncts
rules the souls which are connected with inferior adjuncts only.

Here the pûrvapakshin raises another objection. If we admit that the
souls are parts of the Lord, it follows that the Lord also, whose part
the soul is, will be afflicted by the pain caused to the soul by its
experience of the sa*m*sâra-state; as we see in ordinary life that the
entire Devadatta suffers from the pain affecting his hand or foot or
some other limb. Herefrom it would follow that they who obtain Brahman
obtain a greater pain <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md): so that the
former sa*m*sâra-condition would be preferable, and complete knowledge
be devoid of purpose.--To this the following Sûtra replies.
