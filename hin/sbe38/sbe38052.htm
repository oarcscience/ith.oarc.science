<p>51. On account of the unseen principle being non-limitative.</p>  
<p>While there are many souls, all-pervading like ether, and in equal proximity to all bodies from within as well as without, the so-called unseen principle (ad<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>a), which is of the nature of religious merit or demerit, is acquired through mind, speech, and body (i.e. thoughts, words, and actions).--Now, according to the S&acirc;&#7749;khyas, that principle inheres not in the Self, but abides in the pradh&acirc;na and cannot, on account of the pradh&acirc;na being the same (for all souls), be the limitative cause of the enjoyment of pleasure and pain for each individual Self.--And according to the K&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;das also the unseen principle is due to the non-particular conjunction of the Selfs with the internal</p>

<p>organs, and as thus there is no limitative reason for any particular ad<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>a belonging to any particular soul, the doctrine is open to the same objection.--Well, but there are at work in every particular Self resolutions, &amp;c., such as, 'I wish to obtain that result,' 'I wish to avoid that other result,' 'I am striving for that purpose,' 'I wish to act in that way,' &amp;c. &amp;c., and these may, we assume, define the relation of ownership in which particular Selfs stand to particular ad<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>as.--This objection is negatived in the following S&ucirc;tra.</p>
