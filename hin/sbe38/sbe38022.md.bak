*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

21\. If it be said that (the soul is) not atomic, on account of
scriptural statements about what is not that (i.e. what is opposed to
atomic size); we deny

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

that, on account of the other one (the highest Self) being the
subject-matter (of those passages).

Nevertheless, it may be objected, the soul cannot be of atomic size,
because there are scriptural statements of what is not that, i.e.
because there are scriptural statements of its size being the opposite
of atomic size. So that by accepting the alternative of atomic size we
should place ourselves in opposition to scriptural passages such as the
following, 'He is that great unborn Self who consists of knowledge, is
surrounded by the Prâ*n*as, the ether within the heart' (B*ri*. Up. IV,
4, 22); 'Like the ether he is omnipresent, eternal;' 'Truth, knowledge,
infinite is Brahman' (Taitt. Up. II. i).

This objection, the pûrvapakshin replies, is not valid 'on account of
the other one forming the subject of discussion.' For those statements
about a size different (from the atomic one) occur under the heading of
the highest Self which on account of its pre-eminence constitutes the
general object of knowledge in all Vedânta-texts; and moreover the
passage, 'It is spotless, beyond the ether' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 20),
specially proves that the highest Self constitutes the subject-matter
(in the passage quoted above from the B*ri*. Up.). Thus with regard to
the other passages also.--But from the expressions, 'consisting of
knowledge, surrounded by the prâ*n*as,' it appears that the embodied
Self only (not the highest Self) is designated as connected with
greatness.--That designation, the pûrvapakshin replies, is founded on an
intuition, vouched for by scripture, as in the case of Vâmadeva <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md).--As therefore the statements of a
different size refer to the highest Self (prâ*gñ*a), they do not
militate against the view of the individual soul being of atomic size.
