*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

18\. (Should it be said that the souls must possess unlimited power) on
account of manifest teaching; we reply No, because scripture states him
who, entrusted with office, abides in the spheres (of the sun and so
on), (to be that one on whom the soul's obtaining lordly power depends).

It remains to refute the remark, made by the pûrvapakshin, that absolute
power on the part of those who know must be inferred from texts directly
asserting such power, as e.g. 'He obtains self-lordship.'--This
refutation the above Sûtra undertakes. Scripture declares that the
obtainment of rulership on the soul's part, depends on the

highest Lord who, as entrusted with definite offices, abides in certain
definite abodes, such as the sphere of the sun, &c. This is shown by the
text going on to say (after the clause quoted above), 'He obtains the
lord of Mind.' For that means that he obtains the lord known to be the
lord of all minds. In accordance herewith the text later on says that he
becomes lord of speech, lord of the eye, lord of the ear, lord of
understanding.--Similarly in other passages also the lordly power of the
other souls has to be viewed, according to circumstances, as depending
on the eternally perfect Lord.
