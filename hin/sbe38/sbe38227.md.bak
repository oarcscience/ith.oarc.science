*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

18\. *G*aimini (considers that scriptural passages mentioning those
stages of life in which chastity is obligatory, contain) a reference
(only to those stages);

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

they are not injunctions; for (other scriptural passages) forbid (those
stages).

The Vedic texts which have been quoted to the end of showing the
existence of the stages of life on which chastity is binding-such as
'There are three branches of the law' and so on--have no power to
establish those stages. For the teacher *G*aimini is of opinion that
those passages contain only a reference to the other stages of life, not
an injunction (of them).--Why?--Because they contain no words expressive
of injunction such as imperative verbal forms, and because each of them
is seen to have some other purport. In the passage, 'There are three'
&c., the text at first refers to three stages of life ('Sacrifice,
study, and charity are the first' &c. &c.), thereupon declares them not
to have unbounded results ('All these obtain the world of the blessed'),
and finally glorifies 'the state of being grounded on Brahman' as having
unbounded results ('the Brahmasa*m*stha obtains immortality').--But is
not a mere reference even sufficient to intimate the existence of those
stages of life?--True; but they are established (enjoined) not by direct
scriptural statements, but only by Sm*ri*ti and custom, and therefore
when contradicted by direct scriptural statement <span
id="fr_190"></span>[1](#fn_190.md) are either to be disregarded or else to
be viewed as concerning those who (for some reason or other) are
disqualified (for active worship, sacrifices and the like).--But
together with the stages demanding chastity the text refers to the
condition of the householder also  <span
id="fr_191"></span>[2](#fn_191.md). ('Sacrifice, study, and charity are the
first.')--True; but the existence of the state of the householder is
established (not by that passage but) by other scriptural passages, viz.
those which enjoin on the householder certain works such as the
Agnihotra. Hence the reference in the passage under discussion aims at
glorification only, not at injunction.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Moreover, direct
scriptural enunciations forbid other stages of life; cp. 'A murderer of
the gods is he who removes the fire;' 'After having brought to thy
teacher his proper reward do not cut off the line of children' (Taitt.
Up. I, 11, 1); 'To him who is without a son the world does not belong;
all beasts even know that.'--Similarly the passages, 'Those who in the
forest practise faith and austerity' (*Kh*. Up. V, 10, 1), and the
analogous passage (from the Mu*nd*aka), contain instruction not about
the other stages of life but about the going on the path of the gods.
And of clauses such as 'austerity is the second' it is doubtful whether
they speak of a stage of life at all. And a passage like 'Wishing for
that world only mendicants wander forth,' does not enjoin the wandering
forth but merely glorifies that world. But there is at any rate one
scriptural text which directly and unambiguously enjoins the condition
of life of the wandering mendicant, viz. the one of the *G*âbâlas, 'Let
him wander forth at once from the state of studentship.'--True, but our
discussion is carried on without reference to that passage.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[296:1](sbe38227.htm#fr_190.md) Such as that
concerning the permanent obligation of the Agnihotra and so on.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[296:2](sbe38227.htm#fr_191.md) And we therefore
may conclude that those stages are as valid as the--notoriously
valid--state of householdership.
