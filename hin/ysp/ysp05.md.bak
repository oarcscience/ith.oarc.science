### INTRODUCTION TO BOOK III

The third book of the Sutras is the Book of Spiritual Powers. In
considering these spiritual powers, two things must be understood and
kept in memory. The first of these is this: These spiritual powers can
only be gained when the development described in the first and second
books has been measurably attained; when the Commandments have been
kept, the Rules faithfully followed, and the experiences which are
described have been passed through. For only after this is the spiritual
man so far grown, so far disentangled from the psychical bandages and
veils which have confined and blinded him, that he can use his proper
powers and faculties. For this is the secret of all spiritual powers:
they are in no sense an abnormal or supernatural overgrowth upon the
material man, but are rather the powers and faculties inherent in the
spiritual man, entirely natural to him, and coming naturally into
activity, as the spiritual man is disentangled and liberated from
psychical bondage, through keeping the Commandments and Rules already
set forth.

As the personal man is the limitation and inversion of the spiritual
man, all his faculties and powers are inversions of the powers of the
spiritual man. In a single phrase, his self seeking is the inversion of
the Self-seeking which is the very being of the spiritual man: the
ceaseless search after the divine and august Self of all beings. This
inversion is corrected by keeping the Commandments and Rules, and
gradually, as the inversion is overcome, the spiritual man is
extricated, and comes into possession and free exercise of his powers.
The spiritual powers, therefore, are the powers of the grown and
liberated spiritual man. They can only be developed and used as the
spiritual man grows and attains liberation through obedience. This is
the first thing to be kept in mind, in all that is said of spiritual
powers in the third and fourth books of the Sutras. The second thing to
be understood and kept in mind is this:

Just as our modern sages have discerned and taught that all matter is
ultimately one and eternal, definitely related throughout the whole wide
universe; just as they have discerned and taught that all force is one
and eternal, so coordinated throughout the whole universe that whatever
affects any atom measurably affects the whole boundless realm of matter
and force, to the most distant star or nebula on the dim confines of
space; so the ancient sages had discerned and taught that all
consciousness is one, immortal, indivisible, infinite; so finely
correlated and continuous that whatever is perceived by any
consciousness is, whether actually or potentially, within the reach of
all consciousness, and therefore within the reach of any consciousness.
This has been well expressed by saying that all souls are fundamentally
one with the Oversoul; that the Son of God, and all Sons of God, are
fundamentally one with the Father. When the consciousness is cleared of
psychic bonds and veils, when the spiritual man is able to stand, to
see, then this superb law comes into effect: whatever is within the
knowledge of any consciousness, and this includes the whole infinite
universe, is within his reach, and may, if he wills, be made a part of
his consciousness. This he may attain through his fundamental unity with
the Oversoul, by raising himself toward the consciousness above him, and
drawing on its resources. The Son, if he would work miracles, whether of
perception or of action, must come often into the presence of the
Father. This is the birthright of the spiritual man; through it he comes
into possession of his splendid and immortal powers. Let it be clearly
kept in mind that what is here to be related of the spiritual man, and
his exalted powers, must in no wise be detached from what has gone
before. The being, the very inception, of the spiritual man depends on
the purification and moral attainment already detailed, and can in no
wise dispense with these or curtail them.

Let no one imagine that the true life, the true powers of the spiritual
man, can be attained by any way except the hard way of sacrifice, of
trial, of renunciation, of selfless self-conquest and genuine devotion
to the weal of all others. Only thus can the golden gates be reached and
entered. Only thus can we attain to that pure world wherein the
spiritual man lives, and moves, and has his being. Nothing impure,
nothing unholy can ever cross that threshold, least of all impure
motives or self seeking desires. These must be burnt away before an
entrance to that world can be gained.

But where there is light, there is shadow; and the lofty light of the
soul casts upon the clouds of the mid-world the shadow of the spiritual
man and of his powers; the bastard vesture and the bastard powers of
psychism are easily attained; yet, even when attained, they are a
delusion, the very essence of unreality.

Therefore ponder well the earlier rules, and lay a firm foundation of
courage, sacrifice, selflessness, holiness.
