# The Mahabharata in Sanskrit

### Parallel Devanagari and Romanization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This the Sanskrit text of the Mahabharata in Sanskrit. This is derived
from electronic files created by Prof. Muneo Tokunaga of Kyoto and
edited by John D. Smith. Their data was used to generate parallel
Devanagari and Romanization, using custom C programs created at
Intangible Textual Heritage. This text has been cross-referenced with
Ganguli's [English translation](../maha/index.md) on a book-by-book basis.
However, due to the mismatch in number of chapters per book, it was not
possible to cross-reference this at the chapter level.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This etext uses Unicode extensively. You will need
to make sure that your browser is set up to view Unicode properly. For
more information, read the [Unicode page](../../unicode.md).
