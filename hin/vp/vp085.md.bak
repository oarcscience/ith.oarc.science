### CHAP. XI.

Of the Sadácháras, or perpetual obligations of a householder. Daily
purifications, ablutions, libations, and oblations: hospitality:
obsequial rites: ceremonies to be observed at meals, at morning and
evening worship, and on going to rest.

SAGARA again said to Aurva, "Relate to me, Muni, the fixed observances
of the householder, by attending to which he will never be rejected from
this world or the next."

Aurva replied to him thus: "Listen, prince, to an account of those
perpetual observances, by adhering to which both worlds are subdued.
Those who are called Sádhus (saints) are they who are free from all
defects; and the term Sat means the same, or Sádhu: those practices or
observances (Ácháras) which they follow are therefore called Sadácháras,
the institutions or observances of the pious <span
id="fr_838"></span>[1](#fn_838.md).' The seven Rishis, the Manus, the
patriarchs, are they who have enjoined and who have practised these
observances. Let the wise man awake in the Muhúrtta of Brahmá. (or in
the third Muhúrtta, about two hours before sunrise), and with a composed
mind meditate on two of the objects of life (virtue and wealth), and on
topics not incompatible with them. Let him also think upon desire, as
not conflicting with the other two; and thus contemplate with equal
indifference the three ends of life, for the purpose of counter- acting
the unseen consequences of good or evil acts. Let him avoid wealth and
desire, if they give uneasiness to virtue; and abstain from virtuous or
religious acts, if they involve misery, or are censured by the
world <span id="fr_839"></span>[2](#fn_839.md). Having risen, he must offer
adoration to the sun; and then, in

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

the south-east quarter, at the distance of a bowshot or more, or any
where remote from the village, void the impurities of nature. The water
that remains after washing his feet he must throw away into the
courtyard of the house. A wise man will never void urine on his own
shadow, nor on the shadow of a tree, nor on a cow, nor against the sun,
nor on fire, nor against the wind, nor on his Guru, nor men of the three
first castes; nor will he pass either excrement in a ploughed field, or
pasturage, or in the company of men, or on a high road, or in rivers and
the like, which are holy, or on the bank of a stream, or in a place
where bodies are burnt; or any where quickly. By day let him void them
with his face to the north, and by night with his face to the south,
when he is not in trouble. Let him perform these actions in silence, and
without delay; covering his head with a cloth, and the ground with
grass. Let him not take, for the purposes of cleanliness, earth from an
ant-hill, nor a rat-hole, nor from water, nor from the residue of what
has been so used, nor soil that has been employed to plaster a cottage,
nor such as has been thrown up by insects, or turned over by the plough.
All such kinds of earth let him avoid, as means of purification. One
handful is sufficient after voiding urine; three after passing ordure:
then ten handfulls are to be rubbed over the left hand, and seven over
both hands. Let him then rince his mouth with water that is pure,
neither fetid, nor frothy, nor full of bubbles; and again use earth to
cleanse his feet, washing them well with water. He is to drink water
then three times, and twice wash his face with it; and next touch with
it his head, the cavities of the eyes, ears, and nostrils, the forehead,
the navel, and the heart <span id="fr_840"></span>[3](#fn_840.md). Having
finally washed his mouth, a man is to clean and dress his hair, and to
decorate his person, before a glass, with unguents, garlands, and
perfumes. He is then, according to the custom of his caste, to acquire
wealth, for the sake of subsistence; and with a lively faith worship the
gods. Sacrifices with the acid juice, those with clarified butter, and
those with offerings of food, are comprehended in

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

wealth: wherefore let men exert themselves to acquire wealth for these
purposes <span id="fr_841"></span>[4](#fn_841.md).

"As preparatory to all established rites of devotion the householder
should bathe in the water of a river, a pond, a natural channel, or a
mountain torrent; or he may bathe upon dry ground, with water drawn from
a well, or taken from a, river, or other source, where there is any
objection to bathing on the spot <span id="fr_842"></span>[5](#fn_842.md).
When bathed, and clad in clean clothes, let him devoutly offer libations
to the gods, sages, and progenitors, with the parts of the hand
severally sacred to each. He must scatter water thrice, to gratify the
gods; as many times, to please the Rishis; and once, to propitiate
Prajápati: he must also make three libations, to satisfy the
progenitors. He must then present, with the part of the hand sacred to
the manes, water to his paternal grandfather and great-grandfather, to
his maternal grandfather, great-grandfather, and his father; and at
pleasure to his own mother and his mother's mother and grandmother, to
the wife of his preceptor, to his preceptor, his maternal uncle, and
other relations <span id="fr_843"></span>[6](#fn_843.md), to a dear friend,
and to the

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

king. Let him also, after libations have been made to the gods and the
rest, present others at pleasure for the benefit of all beings, reciting
inaudibly this prayer; 'May the gods, demons, Yakshas, serpents,
Rákshasas, Gandharbas, Pisáchas, Guhyakas, Siddhas, Kushmáńd́as, trees,
birds, fish, all that people the waters, or the earth, or the air, be
propitiated by the water I have presented to them. This water is given
by me for the alleviation of the pains of all those who are suffering in
the realms of hell. May all those who are my kindred, and not my
kindred, and who were my relations in a former life, all who desire
libations from me, receive satisfaction from this water. May this water
and sesamum, presented by me, relieve the hunger and thirst of all who
are suffering from those inflictions, wheresoever they may be <span
id="fr_844"></span>[7](#fn_844.md).' Presentations of water, given in the
manner, oh king, which I have described, yield gratification to all the
world: and the sinless man, who in the sincerity of faith pours out
these voluntary libations, obtains the merit that results from affording
nutriment to all creatures.

"Having then rinced his mouth, he is to offer water to the sun, touching
his forehead with his hands joined, and with this prayer; 'Salutation to
Vivaswat, the radiant, the glory of Vishńu; to the pure illuminator of
the world; to Savitrí, the granter of the fruit of acts.' He is then to
perform the worship of the house, presenting to his tutelary deity
water, flowers, and incense. He is next to offer oblations with fire,
not preceded by any other rite, to Brahmá <span
id="fr_845"></span>[8](#fn_845.md). Having invoked Prajápati, let him pour
oblations reverently to his household gods, to Káśyapa and to
Anumati <span id="fr_846"></span>[9](#fn_846.md), in succession. The
residue of the oblation let him offer to

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

the earth, to water, and to rain, in a pitcher at hand; and to Dhátri
and Vidhátri at the doors of his house, and in the middle of it to
Brahmá. Let the wise man also offer the Bali, consisting of the residue
of the oblations, to Indra, Yama, Varuńa, and Soma, at the four cardinal
points of his dwelling, the east and the rest; and in the north-east
quarter he will present it to Dhanwantari <span
id="fr_847"></span>[10](#fn_847.md). After having thus worshipped the
domestic deities, he will next offer part of the residue to all the gods
(the Viśwadevas); then, in the north-west quarter, to Váyu (wind); then,
in all directions, to the points of the horizon, to Brahmá, to the
atmosphere, and to the sun; to all the gods, to all beings, to the lords
of beings, to the Pitris, to twilight. Then taking other rice <span
id="fr_848"></span>[11](#fn_848.md), let the householder at pleasure cast
it upon a clean spot of ground, as an offering to all beings, repeating
with collected mind this prayer; 'May gods, men, animals, birds, saints,
Yakshas, serpents, demons, ghosts, goblins, trees, all that desire food
given by me; may ants, worms, moths, and other insects, hungered and
bound in the bonds of acts; may all obtain satisfaction from the food
left them by me, and enjoy happiness. May they who have neither mother,
nor father, nor relations, nor food, nor the means of preparing it, be
satisfied and pleased with the food presented for their
contentment <span id="fr_849"></span>[12](#fn_849.md). Inasmuch as all
beings, and this food, and I, and Vishńu are not different, I therefore
give for their sustenance the food that is one with the body of all
creatures. May all beings, that are comprehended in the fourteen orders
of existent things <span id="fr_850"></span>[13](#fn_850.md), be satisfied
with the food bestowed by me for their gratification, and be delighted.'

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Having uttered
this prayer, let the devout believer cast the food upon the ground, for
the nourishment of all kinds of beings; for the householder is thence
the supporter of them all. Let him scatter food upon the ground for
dogs, outcasts, birds, and all fallen and degraded persons.

"The householder is then to remain at eventide in his courtyard as long
as it takes to milk a cow <span id="fr_851"></span>[14](#fn_851.md), or
longer if he pleases, to await the arrival of a guest. Should such a one
arrive, he is to be received with a hospitable welcome; a seat is to be
offered to him, and his feet are to be washed, and food is to be given
him with liberality, and he is to be civilly and kindly spoken to; and
when he departs, to be sent away by his host with friendly wishes. A
householder should ever pay attention to a guest who is not an
inhabitant of the same village, but who comes from another place, and
whose name and lineage are unknown. He who feeds himself, and neglects
the poor and friendless stranger in want of hospitality, goes to hell.
Let a householder who has a knowledge of Brahmá reverence a guest,
without inquiring his studies, his school, his practices, or his
race <span id="fr_852"></span>[15](#fn_852.md).

"A householder should also at the perpetual Śráddha entertain another
Brahman, who is of his own country, whose family and observances are
known, and who performs the five sacramental rites. He is likewise to
present to a Brahman learned in the Vedas four handfulls of food, set
apart with the exclamation Hanta; and he is to give to a mendicant
religious student three handfulls of rice, or according to his pleasure
when he has ample means. These, with the addition of the mendicant
before described, are to be considered as guests; and he who treats
these four descriptions of persons with hospitality acquits himself of
the debt due to his fellow men. The guest who departs disappointed from
any house, and proceeds elsewhere, transfers his sins to the owner of
that mansion, and takes away with him such a householder's merits.
Brahmá, Prajápati, Indra, fire, the Vasus, the sun, are present in the
person of a

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

guest, and partake of the food that is given to him. Let a man therefore
be assiduous in discharging the duties of hospitality; for he who eats
his food without bestowing any upon a guest feeds only upon iniquity.

"In the next place the householder must provide food for a married
damsel, remaining in her father's dwelling; for any one who is ill; for
a pregnant woman; for the aged and the infants of his house; and then he
may eat himself. He who eats whilst these are yet unfed is guilty of sin
in this life, and when he dies is condemned in hell to feed upon phlegm.
So he who eats without performing ablutions is fed in hell with filth;
and he who repeats not his prayers, with matter and blood: he who eats
unconsecrated food, with urine; and he who eats before the children and
the rest are fed is stuffed in Tartarus with ordure. Hear therefore, oh
king of kings, how a householder should feed, so that in eating no sin
may be incurred, that invariable health and increased vigour may be
secured, and all evils and hostile machinations may be averted. Let the
householder, having bathed, and offered libations to the gods and manes,
and decorated his hand with jewels, proceed to take his meal, after
having repeated the introductory prayers, and offered oblations with
fire, and having given food to guests, to Brahmans, to his elders, and
to his family. He must not eat with a single garment on, nor with wet
hands and feet, but dressed in clean clothes, perfumed, and wearing
garlands of flowers: he must not eat with his face to any intermediate
point of the horizon, but fronting the east or the north: and thus, with
a smiling countenance, happy and attentive, let him partake of food, of
good quality, wholesome, boiled with clean water, procured from no vile
person nor by improper means, nor improperly cooked. Having given a
portion to his hungry companions, let him take his food without reproach
out of a clean handsome vessel, which must not be placed upon a low
stool or bed. He must not eat in an unfit place or out of season, nor in
an incommodious attitude; nor must he first cast any of his meal into
the fire. Let his food be made holy with suitable texts; let it be good
of its kind; and it must not be stale, except in the case of fruit or
meat <span id="fr_853"></span>[16](#fn_853.md); nor must it be of

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

dry vegetable substances, other than jujubes <span
id="fr_854"></span>[17](#fn_854.md) or preparations of molasses; but never
must a man eat of that of which the juices have been extracted <span
id="fr_855"></span>[18](#fn_855.md). Nor must a man eat so as to leave no
residue of his meal, except in the case of flour, cakes, honey, water,
curds, and butter. Let him, with an attentive mind, first taste that
which has a sweet flavour: he may take salt and sour things in the
middle course, and finish with those which are pungent and bitter. The
man who commences his meal with fluids, then partakes of solid food, and
finishes with fluids again, will ever be strong and healthy. In this
manner let him feed without fault, silent, and contented with his food;
taking, without uttering a word, to the extent of five handfulls, for
the nutriment of the vital principle. Having eaten sufficiently, the
householder is then to rinse his mouth, with his face turned towards the
east or the north; and having again sipped water, he is to wash his
hands from the wrist downwards. With a pleased and tranquil spirit he is
then to take a seat, and call to memory his tutelary deity; and then he
is thus to pray: 'May fire, excited by air, convert this food into the
earthly elements of this frame, and in the space afforded by the
etherial atmosphere cause it to digest, and yield me satisfaction! May
this food, in its assimilation, contribute to the vigour of the earth,
water, fire, and air of my body, and afford unmixed gratification! May
Agasti, Agni, and submarine fire effect the digestion of the food of
which I have eaten; may they grant me the happiness which its conversion
into nutriment engenders; and may health ever animate my form! May
Vishńu, who is the chief principle of all invested with bodily structure
and the organs of sense, be propitiated by my faith in him, and
influence the assimilation of the invigorating food which I

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

have eaten! For verily Vishńu is the eater and the food and the
nutriment: and through this belief may that which I have eaten be
digested.'

"Having repeated this prayer, the householder should rub his stomach
with his hand, and without indolence perform such rites as confer
repose, passing the day in such amusements as are authorized by holy
writings, and are not incompatible with the practices of the righteous;
until the Sandhyá, when he must engage in pious meditation. At the
Sandhyá, at the close of the day he must perform the usual rites before
the sun has quite set; and in the morning he must perform them before
the stars have disappeared <span id="fr_856"></span>[19](#fn_856.md). The
morning and evening rites must never be neglected, except at seasons of
impurity, anxiety, sickness, or alarm. He who is preceded by the sun in
rising, or sleeps when the sun is setting, unless it proceed from
illness and the like, incurs guilt which requires atonement; and
therefore let a man rise before the sun in the morning, and sleep not
until after be has set. They who sinfully omit both the morning and the
evening service go after death to the hell of darkness. In the evening,
then, having again dressed food, let the wife of the householder, in
order to obtain the fruit of the Vaiśwadeva rite, give food, without
prayers, to outcasts and unclean spirits. Let the householder himself,
according to his means, again shew hospitality to any guest who may
arrive, welcoming him with the salutation of evening, water for his
feet, a seat, a supper, and a bed. The sin of want of hospitality to a
guest who comes after sunset is eight times greater than that of turning
away one who arrives by day. A man should therefore most especially shew
respect to one who comes to him in the evening for shelter, as the
attentions that gratify him will give pleasure to all the gods. Let the
householder, then, according to his ability, afford a guest food,
potherbs, water, a bed, a mat, or, if he can do no more, ground on which
to lie.

"After eating his evening meal, and having washed his feet, the
householder is to go to rest. His bed is to be entire, and made of wood:
it is not to be scanty, nor cracked, nor uneven, nor dirty, nor infested
by insects,

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

nor without a bedding: and he is to sleep with his head either to the
east or to the south; any other position is unhealthy. In due season a
man should approach his wife, when a fortunate asterism prevails, in an
auspicious moment, and on even nights, if she is not unbathed, sick,
unwell, averse, angry, pregnant, hungry, or over-fed. He should be also
free from similar imperfections, should be neatly attired and adorned,
and animated by tenderness and affection. There are certain days on
which unguents, flesh, and women are unlawful, as the eighth and
fourteenth. lunar days, new moon and full moon <span
id="fr_857"></span>[20](#fn_857.md), and the entrance of the sun into a new
sign. On these occasions the wise will restrain their appetites, and
occupy themselves in the worship of the gods, as enjoined by holy writ,
in meditation, and in prayer; and he who behaves differently will fall
into a hell where ordure will be his food. Let not a man stimulate his
desires by medicines, nor gratify them with unnatural objects, or in
public or holy places. Let him not think incontinently of another's
wife, much less address her to that end; for such a man will be born in
future life as a creeping insect. He who commits adultery is punished
both here and hereafter; for his days in this world are cut short, and
when dead he falls into hell. Thus considering, let a man approach his
own wife in the proper season, or even at other times."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_838"></span>[300:1](vp085.htm#fr_838.md) Sir Wm. Jones renders
Áchára, 'the immemorial customs of good men' (Manu, II. 6); following
the explanation of Kullúka Bhat́t́a, which is much the same as that of our
text. 'Áchára means the use of blankets or bark, &c. for dress. Sádhus
are pious or just men.' Ácháras are, in fact, all ceremonial and
purificatory observances or practices, not expiatory, which are enjoined
either by the Vedas or the codes of law.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[300:2](vp085.htm#fr_839.md) That is, he may omit
prescribed rites, if they are attended with difficulty or danger: he may
forego ablutions, if they disagree with his health; and he may omit
pilgrimage to holy shrines, if the way to them is infested by robbers.
Again, it is injoined in certain ceremonies to eat meat, or drink wine;
but these practices <span id="page_301">p. 301</span> are generally
reprehended by pious persons, and a man may therefore disregard the
injunction.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[301:3](vp085.htm#fr_840.md) Many of these
directions are given by Manu, IV. 45, &c.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[302:4](vp085.htm#fr_841.md) That is, wealth is
essential to the performance of religious rites, and it is also the
consequence of performing them. A householder should therefore
diligently celebrate them, that he may acquire property, and thus be
enabled to continue to sacrifice. According to Gautama there are seven
kinds of each of the three sorts of sacrificial rites particularized in
the text, or those in which the Soma juice, oiled butter, or food are
presented. Of the latter, according to Manu, there are four varieties,
the offering of food to the Viśwadevas, to spirits, to deceased
ancestors, and to guests. II. 86. The seven of Gautama are, offerings to
progenitors on certain eighth days of the fortnight, at the full and
change, at Śráddhas generally, and to the manes on the full moon of four
different months, or Śrávan, Agraháyańa, Chaitra, and Áswin.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[302:5](vp085.htm#fr_842.md) A person may perform
his ablutions in his own house, if the weather or occupation prevent his
going to the water. If he be sick, he may use warm water; and if bathing
be altogether injurious, he may perform the Mantra snána, or repeat the
prayers used at ablution, without the actual bath.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[302:6](vp085.htm#fr_843.md) The whole series is
thus given by Mr. Colebrooke; As. Res. V. 367. Triple libations of tila
(sesamum seeds) and water are to be given to the father, paternal
grandfather, and great grandfather; to the mother, maternal grandfather,
great grandfather, and great great grandfather: and single libations are
to be offered to the paternal and maternal grandmother and great
grandmother, to the paternal uncle, brother, son, grandson, daughter's
son, son-in-law, maternal uncle, sister's son, father's sister's son,
mother's sister, and <span id="page_303">p. 303</span> other relatives.
With exception of those, however, offered to his own immediate
ancestors, which are obligatory, these libations are optional, and are
rarely made.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[303:7](vp085.htm#fr_844.md) The first part of
this prayer is from the Sáma-veda, and is given by Mr. Colebrooke. As.
Res. V. 367.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[303:8](vp085.htm#fr_845.md) The rite is not
addressed to Brahmá specially, but he is to be invoked to preside over
the oblations offered to the gods and sages subsequently particularized.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[303:9](vp085.htm#fr_846.md) Káśyapa, the son of
Kaśyapa, is Áditya, or the sun. Anumati is the personified moon, wanting
a digit of full. The objects and order of the ceremony here succinctly
described differ from those of which Mr. Colebrooke gives an account
(As. Res. VII. 236), and from the form of oblations given by Ward
(Account of the Hindus, II. 447); but, as observed by Mr. Colebrooke,
"oblations are made with such ceremonies, and in such form, as are <span
id="page_304">p. 304</span> adapted to the religious rite which is
intended to be subsequently performed." As. Res. VII. 237.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[304:10](vp085.htm#fr_847.md) See also Manu, III.
84, &c. and the As. Res. VII. 275.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[304:11](vp085.htm#fr_848.md) Or this ceremony may
be practised instead of the preceding.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[304:12](vp085.htm#fr_849.md) This prayer is said
by Mr. Colebrooke to be taken from the Puráńas (As. Res. VII. 275): he
translates the last clause, May they who have neither food, nor means of
obtaining it.' In our text the phrase is \#\#\# which the commentator
explains by \#\#\# understanding Anna siddhi to mean 'means of dressing
food,' Páka sádhana. The following passages of the prayer are evidently
peculiar to the Vishńu Puráńa.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[304:13](vp085.htm#fr_850.md) Either fourteen
classes of Bhútas or spirits, or the same number of living beings, or
eight species of divine, one of human, and five of animal creatures.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[305:14](vp085.htm#fr_851.md) This, according to
the commentator, is equal to the fourth part of a Ghat́iká, which,
considering the latter synonymous with Muhúrtta, or one-thirtieth of the
day and night, would be twelve minutes.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[305:15](vp085.htm#fr_852.md) These precepts, and
those which follow, are of the same tenor as those given by Manu on the
subject of hospitality (III. 99, &c.), but more detailed.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[306:16](vp085.htm#fr_853.md) By stale, as applied
to meat, is intended in this place probably meat which has been
previously dressed as part of an offering to the gods or manes: meat
which <span id="page_307">p. 307</span> is dressed in the first instance
for an individual being prohibited; as by Yájnawalkya: 'Let him avoid
flesh killed in vain;' or that which is not the residue of an offering
to the gods, &c. So also Manu, V. 7.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[307:17](vp085.htm#fr_854.md) By dried vegetables,
&c. is to be understood unboiled vegetables, or potherbs dressed without
being sprinkled with water: Instead of 'jujubes,' the reading is
sometimes 'myrobalans:' the other term, \#\#\#, is explained
'sweet-meats.' The construction here, however, is somewhat obscure.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[307:18](vp085.htm#fr_855.md) As oil-cake, or the
sediment of any thing after expression.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[308:19](vp085.htm#fr_856.md) So Manu, II. 101.
and IV. 93.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[309:20](vp085.htm#fr_857.md) So Manu, IV. 128.
