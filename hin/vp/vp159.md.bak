### CHAP. IV.

Continuation of the account of the first kind of dissolution. Of the
second kind, or elemental dissolution; of all being resolved into
primary spirit.

WHEN the waters have reached the region of the seven Rishis, and the
whole of the three worlds is one ocean, they stop. The breath of Vishńu
becomes a strong wind, which blows for more than a hundred years, until
all the clouds are dispersed. The wind is then reabsorbed, and he of
whom all things are made, the lord by whom all things exist, he who is
inconceivable, without beginning of the universe, reposes, sleeping upon
Śesha, in the midst of the deep. The creator, Hari, sleeps upon the
ocean, in the form of Brahmá--glorified by Sanaka And the saints who had
gone to the Janaloka, and contemplated by the holy inhabitants of
Brahmaloka, anxious for final liberation--involved in mystic slumber,
the celestial personification of his own illusions, and meditating on
his own ineffable spirit, which is called Vásudeva. This, Maitreya, is
the dissolution termed incidental, because Hari, in the form of Brahmá,
sleeps there, as its incidental cause.

When the universal spirit wakes, the world revives; when he closes his
eyes, all things fall upon the bed of mystic slumber. In like manner as
a thousand great ages constitute a day of Brahmá, so his night consists
of the same period; during which the world is submerged by a vast ocean.
Awaking at the end of his night, the unborn, Vishńu, in the character of
Brahmá, creates the universe anew, in the manner formerly related to
you <span id="fr_1619"></span>[1](#fn_1619.md).

I have thus described to you the intermediate dissolution of the world,
occurring at the end of every Kalpa. I will now, Maitreya, describe to
you elemental dissolution. When by dearth and fire all the worlds and
Pátálas are withered up, and the modifications of Mahat and other
products of nature are by the will of Krishńa destroyed, the progress of

<span id="page_635">p. 635</span>

elemental dissolution is begun. Then, first, the waters swallow up the
property of earth, which is the rudiment of smell; and earth, deprived
of its property, proceeds to destruction. Devoid of the rudiment of
odour, the earth becomes one with water. The waters then being much
augmented, roaring, and rushing along, fill up all space, whether
agitated or still. When the universe is thus pervaded by the waves of
the watery element, its rudimental flavour is licked up by the element
of fire, and, in consequence of the destruction of their rudiments, the
waters themselves are destroyed. Deprived of the essential rudiment of
flavour, they become one with fire, and the universe is therefore
entirely filled with flame, which drinks up the water on every side, and
gradually overspreads the whole of the world. While space is enveloped
in flame, above, below, and all around, the element of wind seizes upon
the rudimental property, or form, which is the cause of light; and that
being withdrawn, all becomes of the nature of air. The rudiment of form
being destroyed, and fire deprived of its rudiment, air extinguishes
fire, and spreads resistlessly over space, which is deprived of light
when fire merges into air. Air then, accompanied by sound, which is the
source of ether, extends every where throughout the ten regions of
space, until ether seizes upon contact, its rudimental property; by the
loss of which, air is destroyed, and ether remains unmodified: devoid of
form, flavour, touch, and smell, it exists unembodied and vast, and
pervades the whole of space. Ether, whose characteristic property and
rudiment is sound, exists alone, occupying all the vacuity of space. But
then the radical element egotism devours sound, and all the elements and
faculties are at once merged into their original. This primary element
is consciousness, combined with the property of darkness, and is itself
swallowed up by Mahat, whose characteristic property is intelligence;
and earth and Mahat are the inner and outer boundaries of the universe.
In this manner, as in the creation were the seven forms of nature
(Prakriti), reckoned from Mahat to earth <span
id="fr_1620"></span>[2](#fn_1620.md), so, at the time of elemental
dissolution, these seven successively reenter into each other. The egg
of Brahmá is

<span id="page_636">p. 636</span>

dissolved in the waters that surround it, with its seven zones, seven
oceans, seven regions, and their mountains. The investure of water is
drunk up by fire: the stratum of fire is absorbed by that of air: air
blends itself with ether: the primary element of egotism devours the
ether, and is itself taken up by intellect, which, along with all these,
is seized upon by nature (Prakriti). Equilibrium of the three
properties, without excess or deficiency, is called nature (Prakriti),
origin (Hetu), the chief principle (Pradhańa), cause (Kárańa), supreme
(Param). This Prakriti is essentially the same, whether discrete or
indiscrete; only that which is discrete is finally lost or absorbed in
the indiscrete. Spirit also, which is one, pure, imperishable, eternal,
all-pervading, is a portion of that supreme spirit which is all things.
That spirit which is other than (embodied) spirit, in which there are no
attributes of name, species, or the like--which is one with all wisdom,
and is to be understood as sole existence--that is Brahma, infinite
glory, supreme spirit, supreme power, Vishńu, all that is; from whence
the perfect sage returns no more. Nature (Prakriti), which I have
described to you as being essentially both discrete and indiscrete, and
spirit (which is united with body), both resolve into supreme spirit.
Supreme spirit is the upholder of all things, and the ruler of all
things, and is glorified in the Vedas and in the Vedanta by the name of
Vishńu.

Works, as enjoined by the Vedas, are of two kinds, active (Pravritta)
and quiescent (Nivritta); by both of which the universal person is
worshipped by mankind. He, the lord of sacrifice, the male of sacrifice,
the most excellent male, is worshipped by men in the active mode by
rites enjoined in the Rik, Yajur, and Sáma Vedas. The soul of wisdom,
the person of wisdom, Vishńu, the giver of emancipation, is worshipped
by sages in the quiescent form, through meditative devotion. The
exhaustless Vishńu is whatever thing that is designated by long, short,
or prolated syllables, or that which is without a name. He is that which
is discrete, and that which is indiscrete: he is exhaustless spirit,
supreme spirit, universal spirit, Hari, the wearer of universal forms.
Nature, whether discrete or indiscrete, is absorbed into him, and
(detached) spirit also merges into the all-diffusive and unobstructed
spirit.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The period of two
Parárddhas, as I have described it to you, Maitreya, is called a day of
that potent Vishńu; and whilst the products of nature are merged into
their source, nature into spirit, and that into the supreme, that period
is termed his night, and is of equal duration with his day. But, in
fact, to that eternal supreme spirit there is neither day nor night, and
these distinctions are only figuratively applied to the almighty. I have
thus explained to you the nature of elemental dissolution, and will now
expound to you which is final <span id="fr_1621"></span>[3](#fn_1621.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1619"></span>[634:1](vp159.htm#fr_1619.md) The Naimittika
Pralaya is described in the Váyu, Bhágavata, Kúrma, and other Puráńas,
to the same effect, and very commonly in precisely the same words.

<span id="fn_1620"></span>[635:2](vp159.htm#fr_1620.md) See [p.
14](vp036.htm#page_14.md).

<span id="fn_1621"></span>[637:3](vp159.htm#fr_1621.md) The Bhágavata
notices the Prákrita pralaya much more briefly, and it is omitted in the
Váyu.
