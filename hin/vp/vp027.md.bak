The Third Book

The arrangement of the Vedas and other writings considered sacred by the
Hindus, being in fact the authorities of their religious rites and
belief, which is described in the beginning of the third book, is of
much importance to the history of Hindu literature, and of the Hindu
religion. The sage Vyása is here represented, not as the author, but the
arranger or compiler of the Vedas, the Itihásas, and Puráńas. His name
denotes his character, meaning the 'arranger' or 'distributor;' and the
recurrence of

<span id="page_lxiii">p. lxiii</span>

many Vyásas, many individuals who new modelled the Hindu scriptures, has
nothing in it that is improbable, except the fabulous intervals by which
their labours are separated. The rearranging, the refashioning, of old
materials, is nothing more than the progress of time would be likely to
render necessary. The last recognised compilation is that of Krishńa
Dwaipáyańa, assisted by Brahmans, who were already conversant with the
subjects respectively assigned to them. They were the members of a
college or school, supposed by the Hindus to have flourished in a period
more remote, no doubt, than the truth, but not at all unlikely to have
been instituted at some time prior to the accounts of India which we owe
to Greek writers, and in which we see enough of the system to justify
our inferring that it was then entire. That there have been other Vyásas
and other schools since that date, that Brahmans unknown to fame have
remodelled some of the Hindu scriptures, and especially the Puráńas,
cannot reasonably be contested, after dispassionately weighing the
strong internal evidence which all of them afford of the intermixture of
unauthorized and comparatively modern ingredients. But the same internal
testimony furnishes proof equally decisive of the anterior existence of
ancient materials; and it is therefore as idle as it is irrational to
dispute the antiquity or authenticity of the greater portion of the
contents of the Puráńas, in the face of abundant positive and
circumstantial evidence of the prevalence of the doctrines which they
teach, the currency of the legends which they narrate, and the integrity
of the institutions which they describe, at least three centuries before
the Christian era. But the origin and developement of their doctrines,
traditions, and institutions, were not the work of a day; and the
testimony that establishes their existence three centuries before
Christianity, carries it back to a much more remote antiquity, to an
antiquity that is probably not surpassed by any of the prevailing
fictions, institutions, or belief, of the ancient world.

The remainder of the third book describes the leading institutions of
the Hindus, the duties of castes, the obligations of different stages of
life, and the celebration of obsequial rites, in a short but primitive
strain, and in harmony with the laws of Manu. It is a distinguishing
feature of the

<span id="page_lxiv">p. lxiv</span>

Vishńu Puráńa, and it is characteristic of its being the work of an
earlier period than most of the Puráńas, that it enjoins no sectarial or
other acts of supererogation; no Vratas, occasional self-imposed
observances; no holidays, no birthdays of Krishńa, no nights dedicated
to Lakshmí; no sacrifices nor modes of worship other than those
conformable to the ritual of the Vedas. It contains no Máhátmyas, or
golden legends, even of the temples in which Vishńu is adored.
