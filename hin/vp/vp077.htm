<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Division of the Veda into four portions, by a Vy&aacute;sa, in every Dw&aacute;para age. List of the twenty-eight Vy&aacute;sas of the present Manwantara. Meaning of the word Brahma.</FONT></p>  
<p>MAITREYA.--I have learnt from you, in due order, how this world is Vishn&#769;u; how it is in Vishn&#769;u; how it is from Vishn&#769;u: nothing further is to be known: but I should desire to hear how the Vedas were divided, in different ages, by that great being, in the form of Veda-vy&aacute;sa? who were the Vy&aacute;sas of their respective eras? and what were the branches into which the Vedas were distributed?</p>  
<p>PAR&Aacute;&#346;ARA.--The branches of the great tree of the Vedas are so numerous, Maitreya, that it is impossible to describe them at length. I will give you a summary account of them.</p>  
<p>In every Dw&aacute;para (or third) age, Vishn&#769;u, in the person of Vy&aacute;sa, in order to promote the good of mankind, divides the Veda, which is properly but one, into many portions: observing the limited perseverance, energy, and application of mortals, he makes the Veda fourfold, to adapt it to their capacities; and the bodily form which he assumes, in order to effect that classification, is known by the name of Veda-vy&aacute;sa. Of the different Vy&aacute;sas in the present Manwantara&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_781"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the branches which they have taught, you shall have an account.</p>  
<p>Twenty-eight times have the Vedas been arranged by the great Rishis in the Vaivaswata Manwantara in the Dw&aacute;para age, and consequently eight and twenty Vy&aacute;sas have passed away; by whom, in their respective periods, the Veda has been divided into four. In the first Dw&aacute;para age the distribution was made by Swayambhu (Brahm&aacute;) himself; in the second, the arranger of the Veda (Veda-vy&aacute;sa) was Praj&aacute;pati (or Manu); in the third, U&#347;anas; in the fourth, Vrihaspati; in the fifth, Savitri; in the sixth, Mrityu (Death, or Yama); in the seventh, Indra; in the eighth, Va&#347;isht&#769;ha; in the ninth, S&aacute;raswata; in the tenth, Tridh&aacute;man; in</p>

<p>the eleventh, Trivrishan; in the twelfth, Bharadw&aacute;ja; in the thirteenth, Antar&iacute;ksha; in the fourteenth, Vapra; in the fifteenth, Trayy&aacute;run&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_782"></A><A HREF="#fn_782"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; in the sixteenth, Dhananjaya; in the <A HREF="errata.htm#12">seventeenth</A>, Kritanjaya; in the eighteenth, Rin&#769;a; in the nineteenth, Bharadw&aacute;ja; in the twentieth, Gotama; in the twenty-first, Uttama, also called Hary&aacute;tm&aacute;; in the twenty-second, Ven&#769;a, who is likewise named R&aacute;ja&#347;ravas; in the twenty-third, Soma&#347;ushm&aacute;pan&#769;a, also Trin&#769;avindu; in the twenty-fourth, Riksha, the descendant of Bhrigu, who is known also by the name V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki; in the twenty-fifth, my father &#346;akti was the Vy&aacute;sa; I was the Vy&aacute;sa of the twenty-sixth Dw&aacute;para, and was succeeded by Jaratk&aacute;ru; the Vy&aacute;sa of the twenty-eighth, who followed him, was Krishn&#769;a Dwaip&aacute;yana. These are the twenty-eight elder Vy&aacute;sas, by whom, in the preceding Dw&aacute;para ages, the Veda has been divided into four. In the next Dw&aacute;para, Draun&#769;i (the son of Dron&#769;a) will be the Vy&aacute;sa, when my son, the Muni Krishn&#769;a Dwaip&aacute;yana, who is the actual Vy&aacute;sa, shall cease to be (in that character)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_783"></A><A HREF="#fn_783"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The syllable Om is defined to be the eternal monosyllabic Brahma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_784"></A><A HREF="#fn_784"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The word Brahma is derived from the root Vriha (to increase), because it is infinite (spirit), and because it is the cause by which the Vedas (and</p>

<p>all things) are developed. Glory to Brahma, who is addressed by that mystic word, associated eternally with the triple universe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_785"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and who is one with the four Vedas. Glory to Brahma, who, alike in the destruction and renovation of the world, is called the great and mysterious cause of the intellectual principle (Mahat); who is without limit in time or space, and exempt from diminution or decay; in whom (as connected with the property of darkness) originates worldly illusion; and in whom resides the end of soul (fruition or liberation), through the properties of light and of activity (or goodness and foulness). He is the refuge of those who are versed in the S&aacute;nkhya philosophy; of those who have acquired control over their thoughts and passions. He is the invisible, imperishable Brahma; varying in form, invariable in substance; the chief principle, self-engendered; who is said to illuminate the caverns of the heart; who is indivisible, radiant, undecaying, multiform. To that supreme Brahma be for ever adoration.</p>  
<p>That form of V&aacute;sudeva, who is the same with supreme spirit, which is Brahma, and which, although diversified as threefold, is identical, is the lord, who is conceived by those that contemplate variety in creation to be distinct in all creatures. He, composed of the Rik, Sauna, and Yajur-Vedas, is at the same time their essence, as he is the soul of all embodied spirits. He, distinguished as consisting of the Vedas, creates the Vedas, and divides them by many subdivisions into branches: he is the author of those branches: he is those aggregated branches; for he, the eternal lord, is the essence of true knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_786"></A><A HREF="#fn_786"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_781"></A><A HREF="vp077.htm#fr_781">272:1</A> The text has, 'Hear from me an account of the Vy&aacute;sas of the different Manwantaras;' but this is inconsistent with what follows, in which the enumeration is confined to the Vaivaswata Manwantara.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_782"></A><A HREF="vp077.htm#fr_782">273:2</A> This name occurs as that of one of the kings of the solar dynasty, and is included by Mr. Colebrooke amongst the persons of royal descent, who are mentioned as authors of hymns in the Rig-veda. As. Res. VIII. 383.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_783"></A><A HREF="vp077.htm#fr_783">273:3</A> A similar list of Vy&aacute;sas is given in the K&uacute;rma and V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;as. Many of the individuals appear as authors of different hymns and prayers in the Vedas; and it is very possible that the greater portion, if not all of them, had a real existence, being the framers or teachers of the religion of the Hindus before a complete ritual was compiled.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_784"></A><A HREF="vp077.htm#fr_784">273:4</A> We have already had occasion to explain the sanctity of this monosyllable (see <A HREF="vp035.htm#page_1">p. 1</A>, n. <A HREF="vp035.htm#fn_98">1</A>), which ordinarily commences different portions of the Vedas, and which, as the text describes it, is identified with the supreme, undefinable deity, or Brahma. So in the Bhagavad-g&iacute;ta: 'Repeating Om, the monosyllable, which is Brahma, and calling me to mind:' which is not exactly the same idea that is conveyed by Schlegel's version; 'Monosyllabum mysticum Om pronuntiando, numen adorans, mei memor;' where 'numen adorans,' although it may be defended as necessary to the sense, is not expressed by the words of the text, nor compatible with Hindu notions. In one of the MSS. employed, the transcriber has evidently been afraid of desecrating this sacred monosyllable, and has therefore altered the text, writing it ### instead of ###.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_785"></A><A HREF="vp077.htm#fr_785">274:5</A> The daily prayers of the Brahman commence with the formula, Om bh&uacute;h, bhuvah, swar: Om earth, sky, heaven: these are the three mystical terms called Vy&aacute;hritis, and are scarcely of less sanctity than the Pran&#769;ava itself. Their efficacy, and the order of their repetition preceding the G&aacute;yatr&iacute;, are fully detailed in Manu, II. 76-81. In the Mit&aacute;kshara they are directed to be twice repeated mentally, with Om prefixed to each; Om bh&uacute;h, Om bhuvah, Om swar; the breath being suppressed by closing the lips and nostrils.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_786"></A><A HREF="vp077.htm#fr_786">274:6</A> The form or sensible type of V&aacute;sudeva is here considered to be the monosyllable Om, and which is one with the three mystical words, Bh&uacute;h, Bhuvar, Swar, and with the Vedas: consequently the Vy&aacute;hritis and the Vedas are also forms of V&aacute;sudeva, diversified as to their typical character, but essentially one and the same.</P>
