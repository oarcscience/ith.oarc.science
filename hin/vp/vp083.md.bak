### CHAP. IX.

Duties of the religious student, householder, hermit, and mendicant.

AURVA continued.--"When the youth has been invested with the thread of
his caste, let him diligently prosecute the study of the Vedas, in the
house of his preceptor, with an attentive spirit, and leading a life of
continence. He is to wait upon his Guru, assiduously observant of
purificatory practices, and the Veda is to be acquired by him, whilst he
is regular in the performance of religious rites. In the morning Sandhya
he is first to salute the sun; in the evening, fire; and then to address
his preceptor with respect. He must stand when his master is standing;
move when he is walking; and sit beneath him when he is seated: he must
never sit, nor walk, nor stand when his teacher does the reverse. When
desired by him, let him read the Veda attentively, placed before his
preceptor; and let him eat the food he has collected as alms, when
permitted by his teacher <span id="fr_821"></span>[1](#fn_821.md). Let him
bathe in water which has first been used for his preceptor's ablutions;
and every morning bring fuel and water, and whatsoever else may be
required.

"When the scriptural studies appropriate to the student have been
completed, and he has received dismissal from his Guru, let the
regenerate man enter into the order of the householder; and taking unto
himself, with lawful ceremonies, house, wife, and wealth, discharge to
the best of his ability the duties of his station <span
id="fr_822"></span>[2](#fn_822.md); satisfying the manes with funeral
cakes; the gods with oblations; guests with hospitality; the sages with
holy study; the progenitors of mankind with progeny; the spirits with
the residue of oblations; and all the world with words of truth <span
id="fr_823"></span>[3](#fn_823.md). A

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

householder secures heaven by the faithful discharge of these
obligations. There are those who subsist upon alms, and lead an erratic
life of self-denial, at the end of the term during which they have kept
house. They wander over the world to see the earth, and perform their
ablutions, with rites enjoined by the Vedas, at sacred shrines:
houseless, and without food, and resting for the night at the dwelling
at which they arrive in the evening. The householder is to them a
constant refuge and parent: it is his duty to give them a welcome, and
to address them with kindness; and to provide them, whenever they come
to his house, with a bed, a seat, and food. A guest disappointed by a
householder, who turns away from his door, transfers to the latter all
his own misdeeds, and bears away his religious merit <span
id="fr_824"></span>[4](#fn_824.md). In the house of a good man, contumely,
arrogance, hypocrisy, repining, contradiction, and violence are
annihilated: and the householder who fully performs this his chief duty
of hospitality is released from every kind of bondage, and obtains the
highest of stations after death.

"When the householder, after performing the acts incumbent on his
condition, arrives at the decline of life, let him consign his wife to
the care of his sons, and go himself to the forests <span
id="fr_825"></span>[5](#fn_825.md). Let him there subsist upon leaves,
roots, and fruit; and suffer his hair and beard to grow, and braid the
former upon his brows; and sleep upon the ground: his dress must be made
of skin or of Káśa or Kuśa grasses; and he must bathe thrice a day; and
he must offer oblations to the gods and to fire, and treat all that come
to him with hospitality: he must beg alms, and present food to all
creatures: he must anoint himself with such unguents as the woods
afford; and in his devotional exercises he must be endurant of heat and
cold. The sage who diligently follows these rules, and leads the life of
the hermit (or Vánaprastha), consumes, like fire, all imperfections, and
conquers for himself the mansions of eternity.

"The fourth order of men is called that of the mendicant; the
circumstances of which it is fit, oh king, that you should hear from me.
Let the unimpassioned man, relinquishing all affection for wife,
children,

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

and possessions, enter the fourth order <span
id="fr_826"></span>[6](#fn_826.md). Let him forego the three objects of
human existence (pleasure, wealth, and virtue), whether secular or
religious, and, indifferent to friends, be the friend of all living
beings. Let him, occupied with devotion, abstain from wrong, in act,
word, or thought, to all creatures, human or brute; and equally avoid
attachment to any. Let him reside but for one night in a village, and
not more than five nights at a time in a city; and let him so abide,
that good-will, and not animosity, may be engendered. Let him, for the
support of existence, apply for alms at the houses of the three first
castes, at the time when the fires have been extinguished, and people
have eaten. Let the wandering mendicant call nothing his own, and
suppress desire, anger, covetousness, pride, and folly. The sage who
gives no cause for alarm to living beings need never apprehend any
danger from them. Having deposited the sacrificial fire in his own
person, the Brahman feeds the vital flame, with the butter that is
collected as alms, through the altar of his mouth; and by means of his
spiritual fire he proceeds to his own proper abode. But the twice-born
man <span id="fr_827"></span>[7](#fn_827.md), who seeks for liberation, and
is pure of heart, and whose mind is perfected by self-investigation,
secures the sphere of Brahmá, which is tranquil, and is as a bright
flame that emits not smoke."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_821"></span>[294:1](vp083.htm#fr_821.md) These directions are
the same as those prescribed by Manu, though not precisely in the same
words. II. 175, et seq.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[294:2](vp083.htm#fr_822.md) So Manu, III. 4, &c.

<span id="fn_823"></span>[294:3](vp083.htm#fr_823.md) The great
obligations, or, as Sir Wm. Jones terms them, sacraments, the
Maháyajnas, or great sacrifices, are, according to Manu, but five;
Brahmayajna, sacred study; Pitriyajna, libations to the manes;
Devayajna, burnt-offerings to the gods; Baliyajna, offerings to all
creatures; and Nriyajna, hospitality. III. 70, 71. The Prajápatiyajna,
or propagation of offspring, and Satyayajna, observance of truth, are
apparently later additions.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[295:4](vp083.htm#fr_824.md) This is also the
doctrine of Manu, III. 100.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[295:5](vp083.htm#fr_825.md) Manu, VI. 3, &c.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[296:6](vp083.htm#fr_826.md) Manu, VI. 33, &c.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[296:7](vp083.htm#fr_827.md) The text uses the
term Dwijáti, which designates a man of the three first castes. The
commentator cites various authorities to prove that its sense should be
Brahman only, who alone is permitted to enter the fourth
order.--'Entrance into the fourth order is never for the Kshatriya and
Vaiśya. Entrance into the fourth order is for Brahmans, according to
Swayambhu. So says Dattátreya: "Let the Brahman proceed from his
dwelling is also the expression of Yama, Samvartta, and Baudháyana."'
But this is not the general understanding of the law, nor was it
originally so restricted apparently. Manu does not so limit it.
