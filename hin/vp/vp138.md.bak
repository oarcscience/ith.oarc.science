### CHAP. XXI.

Krishńa encourages his parents; places Ugrasena on the throne; becomes
the pupil of Sándípani, whose son he recovers from the sea: he kills the
marine demon Panchajana, and makes a horn of his shell.

HAVING permitted to Devakí and Vasudeva an interval of true knowledge,
through the contemplation of his actions, Hari again spread the
delusions of his power over them and the tribe of Yadu. He said to them,
"Mother; venerable father; you have both been long observed by
Sankarshańa and myself with sorrow, and in fear of Kansa. He whose time
passes not in respect to his father and mother, is a vile being, who
descends in vain from virtuous parents. The lives of those produce good
fruit, who reverence their parents, their spiritual guides, the
Brahmans, and the gods. Pardon therefore, father, the impropriety of
which we may have been culpable, in resenting without your orders, to
which we acknowledge that we are subject, the oppression we suffered
from the power and violence of Kansa." Thus speaking, they offered
homage to the elders of the Yadu tribe in order, and then in a suitable
manner paid their respects to the citizens. The wives of Kansa, and
those of his father, then surrounded the body of the king, lying on the
ground, and bewailed his fate in deep affliction. Hari in various ways
expressed his regret for what had chanced, and endeavoured to console
them, his own eyes being suffused with tears. The foe of Madhu then
liberated Ugrasena from confinement, and placed him on the throne, which
the death of his son had left vacant. The chief of the Yádavas, being
crowned, performed the funeral rites of Kansa, and of the rest of the
slain. When the ceremony was over, and Ugrasena had resumed his royal
seat, Krishńa addressed him, and said, "Sovereign lord, command boldly
what else is to be done. The curse of Yayáti has pronounced our race
unworthy of dominion <span id="fr_1518"></span>[1](#fn_1518.md); but with
me, for your servant, you may issue your orders to the gods. How should
kings disobey them?"

<span id="page_561">p. 561</span>

Thus having spoken, the human Keśava summoned mentally the deity of the
wind, who came upon the instant, and said to him, "Go, Váyu, to Indra,
and desire him to lay aside his pomp, and resign to Ugrasena his
splendid hall Sudharman: tell him that Krishńa commands him to send the
royal hall, the unrivalled gem of princely courts, for the assemblage of
the race of Yadu." Accordingly Váyu went, and delivered the message to
the husband of Śachí, who immediately gave up to him the hall Sudharman,
and Váyu conveyed it to the Yádavas, the chiefs of whom thenceforth
possessed this celestial court, emblazoned with jewels, and defended by
the arm of Govinda. The two excellent Yadu youths, versed in all
knowledge, and possessed of all wisdom, then submitted to instruction,
as the disciples of teachers. Accordingly they repaired to
Sándípani--who, though born in Káśí, resided at Avanti--to study the
science of arms, and, becoming his pupils, were obedient and attentive
to their master, exhibiting an example to all men of the observance of
instituted rules. In the course of sixty-four days they had gone through
the elements of military science, with the treatises on the use of arms,
and directions for the mystic incantations, which secure the aid of
supernatural weapons <span id="fr_1519"></span>[2](#fn_1519.md). Sándípani,
astonished at such proficiency, and knowing that it exceeded human
faculties, imagined that the sun and moon had become his scholars. When
they had acquired all that he could teach, they said to him, "Now say
what present shall be given to you, as the preceptor's fee." The prudent
Sándípani, perceiving that they were endowed with more than mortal
powers, requested them to give him his dead son, drowned in the sea of
Prabhása <span id="fr_1520"></span>[3](#fn_1520.md). Taking up their arms,
they marched against the ocean; but the all-comprehending sea said to
them, "I have not killed the son of Sándípani; a demon

<span id="page_562">p. 562</span>

named Panchajana, who lives in the form of a conch shell, seized the
boy: he is still under my waters. On hearing this, Krishńa plunged into
the sea; and having slain the vile Panchajana, he took the conch shell,
which was formed of his bones (and bore it as his horn), the sound of
which fills the demon hosts with dismay, animates the vigour of the
gods, and annihilates unrighteousness. The heroes also recovered the boy
from the pains of death, and restored him in his former person to his
father. Ráma and Janárddana then returned to Mathurá, which was well
presided over by Ugrasena, and abounded in a happy population both of
men and women <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1](#fn_1521.md).

<span id="fn_1518"></span>[560:1](vp138.htm#fr_1518.md) The curse
pronounced on the elder sons of Yayáti, on their refusing to take upon
them their father's infirmities. See [p. 414](vp103.htm#page_414.md).

the Dhanur-veda, which treats of military matters; with the Rahasyá,
'the mystical part;' and the Sangraha, 'collection' or 'compendium,'
said to be here the Astra-prayoga, the employment of weapons:

<span id="fn_1520"></span>[561:3](vp138.htm#fr_1520.md) Prabhása is a place
of pilgrimage in the west of India, on the coast of Guzerat, near the
temple of Somanath, and town of Pattan Somanath. It is also known by the
name of Soma-tírtha; Soma, or the moon, having been here cured of the
consumption brought upon him by the imprecation of Daksha, his
father-in-law. Mahábhárata, Śalya P., vol. III. p. 249.

<span id="fn_1521"></span>[562:1](vp138.htm#fr_1521.md) The incidents of
the two last chapters are related in the Bhágavata and Hari Vanśa, often
in the words of the text, but with many embellishments and additions,
especially in the latter. The Brahma Vaivartta, on the other hand, makes
still shorter work of these occurrences than our text.
