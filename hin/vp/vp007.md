*The Vishnu Purana*, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson, \[1840\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3\. The Vishńu Puráńa

[3](errata.htm#0.md). Vishńu Puráńa. "That in which Paráśara, beginning
with the events of the Varáha Kalpa, expounds all duties, is called the
Vaishńava; and the learned know its extent to be twenty-three thousand
stanzas <span id="fr_40"></span>[41](#fn_40.md)." The third Puráńa of the
lists is that which has been selected for translation, the Vishńu. It is
unnecessary therefore to offer any general summary of its contents, and
it will be convenient to reserve any remarks upon its character and
probable antiquity for a subsequent page. It may here be observed,
however, that the actual number of verses contained in it falls far
short of the enumeration of the Matsya, with which the Bhágavata
concurs. Its actual contents are not seven thousand stanzas. All the
copies, and in this instance they are not fewer than seven in number,
procured both in the east and in the west of India, agree; and there is
no appearance of any part being wanting. There is a beginning, a middle,
and an end, in both text and comment; and the work as it stands is
incontestably entire. How is the discrepancy to be explained?
