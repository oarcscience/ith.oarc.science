### CHAP. XIX.

Dialogue between Prahláda and his father: he is cast from the top of the
palace unhurt: baffles the incantations of Samvara: he is thrown
fettered into the sea: he praises Vishńu.

WHEN Hirańyakaśipu heard that the powerful incantations of his priests
had been defeated, he sent for his son, and demanded of him the secret
of his extraordinary might. "Prahláda," he said, "thou art possessed of
marvellous powers; whence are they derived? are they the result of magic
rites? or have they accompanied thee from birth?" Prahláda, thus
interrogated, bowed down to his father's feet, and replied, "Whatever
power I possess, father, is neither the result of magic rites, nor is it
inseparable from my nature; it is no more than that which is possessed
by all in whose hearts Achyuta abides. He who meditates not of wrong to
others, but considers them as himself, is free from the effects of sin,
inasmuch as the cause does not exist; but he who inflicts pain upon
others, in act, thought, or speech, sows the seed of future birth, and
the fruit that awaits him after birth is pain. I wish no evil to any,
and do and speak no offence; for I behold Keśava in all beings, as in my
own soul. Whence should corporeal or mental suffering or pain, inflicted
by elements or the gods, affect me, whose heart is thoroughly purified
by him? Love, then, for all creatures will be assiduously cherished by
all those who are wise in the knowledge that Hari is all things."

When he had thus spoken, the Daitya monarch, his face darkened with
fury, commanded his attendants to cast his son from the summit of the
palace where he was sitting, and which was many Yojanas in height, down
upon the tops of the mountains, where his body should be dashed to
pieces against the rocks. Accordingly the Daityas hurled the boy down,
and he fell cherishing Hari in his heart, and Earth, the nurse of all
creatures, received him gently on her lap, thus entirely devoted to
Keśava, the protector of the world.

Beholding him uninjured by the fall, and sound in every bone,
Hirańyakaśipu addressed himself to Samvara, the mightiest of enchanters,

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

and said to him, "This perverse boy is not to be destroyed by us: do
you, who art potent in the arts of delusion, contrive some device for
his destruction." Samvara replied, "I will destroy him: you shall
behold, king of the Daityas, the power of delusion, the thousand and the
myriad artifices that it can employ." Then the ignorant Asura Samvara
practised subtile wiles for the extermination of the firm-minded
Prahláda: but he, with a tranquil heart, and void of malice towards
Samvara, directed his thoughts uninterruptedly to the destroyer of
Madhu; by whom the excellent discus, the flaming Sudarsana, was
dispatched to defend the youth; and the thousand devices of the
evil-destinied Samvara were every one foiled by this defender of the
prince. The king of the Daityas then commanded the withering wind to
breathe its blighting blast upon his son: and, thus commanded, the wind
immediately penetrated into his frame, cold, cutting, drying, and
insufferable. Knowing that the wind had entered into his body, the
Daitya boy applied his whole heart to the mighty upholder of the earth;
and Janárddana, seated in his heart, waxed wroth, and drank up the
fearful wind, which had thus hastened to its own annihilation.

When the devices of Samvara were all frustrated, and the blighting wind
had perished, the prudent prince repaired to the residence of his
preceptor. His teacher instructed him daily in the science of polity, as
essential to the administration of government, and invented by Uśanas
for the benefit of kings; and when he thought that the modest prince was
well grounded in the principles of the science, he told the king that
Prahláda was thoroughly conversant with the rules of government as laid
down by the descendant of Bhrigu. Hirańyakaśipu therefore summoned the
prince to his presence, and desired him to repeat what he had learned;
how a king should conduct himself towards friends or foes; what measures
he should adopt at the three periods (of advance, retrogression, or
stagnation); how he should treat his councillors, his ministers, the
officers of his government and of his household, his emissaries, his
subjects, those of doubtful allegiance, and his foes; with whom should
he contract alliance; with whom engage in war; what sort of fortress he
should construct; how forest and mountain tribes should be reduced;

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

how internal grievances should be rooted out: all this, and what else he
had studied, the youth was commanded by his father to explain. To this,
Prahláda having bowed affectionately and reverentially to the feet of
the king, touched his forehead, and thus replied:--

"It is true that I have been instructed in all these matters by my
venerable preceptor, and I have learnt them, but I cannot in all approve
them. It is said that conciliation, gifts, punishment, and sowing
dissension are the means of securing friends (or overcoming foes) <span
id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_316.md); but I, father--be not angry--know
neither friends nor foes; and where no object is to be accomplished, the
means of effecting it are superfluous. It were idle to talk of friend or
foe in Govinda, who is the supreme soul, lord of the world, consisting
of the world, and who is identical with all beings. The divine Vishńu is
in thee, father, in me, and in all every where else; and hence how can I
speak of friend or foe, as distinct from myself? It is therefore waste
of time to cultivate such tedious and unprofitable sciences, which are
but false knowledge, and all our energies should be dedicated to the
acquirement of true wisdom. The notion that ignorance is knowledge
arises, father, from ignorance. Does not the child, king of the Asuras,
imagine the fire-fly to be a spark of fire. That is active duty, which
is not for our bondage; that is knowledge, which is for our liberation:
all other duty is good only unto weariness; all other knowledge is only
the cleverness of an artist. Knowing this, I look upon all such
acquirement as profitless. That which is really profitable hear me, oh
mighty monarch, thus prostrate before thee, proclaim. He who cares not
for dominion, he who cares not for wealth, shall assuredly obtain both
in a life to come. All men, illustrious prince, are toiling to be great;
but the destinies of men, and not their own exertions, are the cause of
greatness. Kingdoms are the gifts of fate, and are bestowed upon the
stupid, the ignorant, the cowardly, and those to whom the science of
government is unknown. Let him therefore who covets the goods of fortune
be assiduous in the practice of virtue: let him who hopes for final
liberation learn to look upon all things as equal and the

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

same. Gods, men, animals, birds, reptiles, all are but forms of one
eternal Vishńu, existing as it were detached from himself. By him who
knows this, all the existing world, fixed or movable, is to be regarded
as identical with himself, as proceeding alike from Vishńu, assuming a
universal form. When this is known, the glorious god of all, who is
without beginning or end, is pleased; and when he is pleased, there is
an end of affliction."

On hearing this, Hirańyakaśipu started up from his throne in a fury, and
spurned his son on the breast with his foot. Burning with rage, he wrung
his hands, and exclaimed, "Ho Viprachitti! ho Ráhu! ho Bali <span
id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_317.md)! bind him with strong bands <span
id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_318.md), and cast him into the ocean, or all the
regions, the Daityas and Dánavas, will become converts to the doctrines
of this silly wretch. Repeatedly prohibited by us, he still persists in
the praise of our enemies. Death is the just retribution of the
disobedient." The Daityas accordingly bound the prince with strong
bands, as their lord had commanded, and threw him into the sea. As he
floated on the waters, the ocean was convulsed throughout its whole
extent, and rose in mighty undulations, threatening to submerge the
earth. This when Hirańyakaśipu observed, he commanded the Daityas to
hurl rocks into the sea, and pile them closely on one another, burying
beneath their incumbent mass him whom fire would not burn, nor weapons
pierce, nor serpents bite; whom the pestilential gale could not blast,
nor poison nor magic spirits nor incantations destroy; who fell from the
loftiest heights unhurt; who foiled the elephants of the spheres: a son
of depraved heart, whose life was a perpetual curse. "Here," he cried,
"since he cannot die, here let him live for thousands of years at the
bottom of the ocean, overwhelmed by mountains. Accordingly the Daityas
and Dánavas hurled upon Prahláda, whilst in the great ocean, ponderous
rocks,

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

and piled them over him for many thousand miles: but he, still with mind
undisturbed, thus offered daily praise to Vishńu, lying at the bottom of
the sea, under the mountain heap. "Glory to thee, god of the lotus eye:
glory to thee, most excellent of spiritual things: glory to thee, soul
of all worlds: glory to thee, wielder of the sharp discus: glory to the
best of Brahmans; to the friend of Brahmans and of kine; to Krishńa, the
preserver of the world: to Govinda be glory. To him who, as Brahmá,
creates the universe; who in its existence is its preserver; be praise.
To thee, who at the end of the Kalpa takest the form of Rudra; to thee,
who art triform; be adoration. Thou, Achyuta, art the gods, Yakshas,
demons, saints, serpents, choristers and dancers of heaven, goblins,
evil spirits, men, animals, birds, insects, reptiles, plants, and
stones, earth, water, fire, sky, wind, sound, touch, taste, colour,
flavour, mind, intellect, soul, time, and the qualities of nature: thou
art all these, and the chief object of them all. Thou art knowledge and
ignorance, truth and falsehood, poison and ambrosia. Thou art the
performance and discontinuance of acts <span
id="fr_319"></span>[4](#fn_319.md): thou art the acts which the Vedas
enjoin: thou art the enjoyer of the fruit of all acts, and the means by
which they are accomplished. Thou, Vishńu, who art the soul of all, art
the fruit of all acts of piety. Thy universal diffusion, indicating
might and goodness, is in me, in others, in all creatures, in all
worlds. Holy ascetics meditate on thee: pious priests sacrifice to thee.
Thou alone, identical with the gods and the fathers of mankind,
receivest burnt-offerings and oblations <span
id="fr_320"></span>[5](#fn_320.md). The universe is thy intellectual
form <span id="fr_321"></span>[6](#fn_321.md); whence proceeded thy subtile
form, this world: thence art thou all subtile elements and elementary
beings, and the subtile principle, that is called soul, within them.
Hence the supreme soul of all objects, distinguished as subtile or
gross, which is imperceptible, and which cannot be conceived, is even a
form of thee. Glory be to thee, Purushottama; and

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

glory to that imperishable form which, soul of all, is another
manifestation <span id="fr_322"></span>[7](#fn_322.md) of thy might, the
asylum of all qualities, existing in all creatures. I salute her, the
supreme goddess, who is beyond the senses; whom the mind, the tongue,
cannot define; who is to be distinguished alone by the wisdom of the
truly wise. Om! salutation to Vásudeva: to him who is the eternal lord;
he from whom nothing is distinct; he who is distinct from all. Glory be
to the great spirit again and again: to him who is without name or
shape; who sole is to be known by adoration; whom, in the forms
manifested in his descents upon earth, the dwellers in heaven adore; for
they behold not his inscrutable nature. I glorify the supreme deity
Vishńu, the universal witness, who seated internally, beholds the good
and ill of all. Glory to that Vishńu from whom this world is not
distinct. May he, ever to be meditated upon as the beginning of the
universe, have compassion upon me: may he, the supporter of all, in whom
every thing is warped and woven <span id="fr_323"></span>[8](#fn_323.md),
undecaying, imperishable, have compassion upon me. Glory, again and
again, to that being to whom all returns, from whom all proceeds; who is
all, and in whom all things are: to him whom I also am; for he is every
where; and through whom all things are from me. I am all things: all
things are in me, who am everlasting. I am undecayable, ever enduring,
the receptacle of the spirit of the supreme. Brahma is my name; the
supreme soul, that is before all things, that is after the end of all.
