Future kings of the family of Ikshwáku, ending with Sumitra.

I WILL now repeat to you the future princes of the family of
Ikshwáku <span id="fr_1308"></span>[1](#fn_1308.md).

The son of Vrihadbala <span id="fr_1309"></span>[2](#fn_1309.md) will be
Vrihatkshańa <span id="fr_1310"></span>[3](#fn_1310.md); his son will be

the kings of the family of Ikshwáku, descended from Vrihadbala. This
commemorative verse is current concerning them; "The race of the
descendants of Ikshwáku will terminate with Sumitra: it will end in the
Kali age with him <span id="fr_1330"></span>[23](#fn_1330.md)."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1308"></span>[463:1](vp115.htm#fr_1308.md) See [p.
359](vp094.htm#page_359.md).

<span id="fn_1309"></span>[463:2](vp115.htm#fr_1309.md) Vrihadratha: Váyu,

<span id="fn_1310"></span>[463:3](vp115.htm#fr_1310.md) Vrihatkshaya: Váyu.
Vrihadrańa: Bhág. Omitted: Mats.

<span id="fn_1311"></span>[463:4](vp115.htm#fr_1311.md) Omitted: Váyu.
Urukshaya: Mats. Urukriya: Bhág.

<span id="fn_1312"></span>[463:5](vp115.htm#fr_1312.md) Omitted by all
three.

<span id="fn_1313"></span>[463:6](vp115.htm#fr_1313.md) Vatsavriddha: Bhág.

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[463:7](vp115.htm#fr_1314.md) Prativyúha: Váyu.

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[463:8](vp115.htm#fr_1315.md) The Bhágavata
inserts Bhánu. The Matsya says that Ayodhyá was the capital of Divákara.
The Váyu omits the next twelve names; probably a defect in the copies.

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[463:9](vp115.htm#fr_1316.md) Dhruváśwa: Mats.

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[463:10](vp115.htm#fr_1317.md) Bhánumat: Bhág.
Bhávyaratha or Bhávya: Mats.

<span id="fn_1318"></span>[463:11](vp115.htm#fr_1318.md) Pratikáśwa: Bhág.
Pratípáśwa: Mats.

<span id="fn_1319"></span>[463:12](vp115.htm#fr_1319.md) The Bhágavata and
Matsya prefix a Supratípa or Supratíka.

<span id="fn_1320"></span>[463:13](vp115.htm#fr_1320.md) Pushkara: Bhág.

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[463:14](vp115.htm#fr_1321.md) Suparvan or
Sumantra: Mats. Sutapas: Bhág.

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[463:15](vp115.htm#fr_1322.md) Amantravit:
Matsya.

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[463:16](vp115.htm#fr_1323.md) Vrihadbrája: Bhág,

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[463:17](vp115.htm#fr_1324.md) Omitted: Mats.
Varhish: Bhág.

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[463:18](vp115.htm#fr_1325.md) The Bhágavata and
Váyu have Śákya. My copy of the Matsya has Śádhya, but the Radcliffe
MS., more correctly, no doubt, Śakya.

<span id="fn_1326"></span>[463:19](vp115.htm#fr_1326.md) In some copies
Krodhodana; but it is also Śuddhodana, Mats. and Váyu; Śuddhoda, Bhág.

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[463:20](vp115.htm#fr_1327.md) Ráhula: Váyu.
Siddhártha or Pushkala: Mats. Lángala: Bhág. This and the two preceding
names are of considerable chronological interest; for Śákya is the name
of the author or reviver of Buddhism, whose birth appears to have
occurred in the seventh, and death in the sixth century before Christ
(B. C. 621-543). There can be no doubt of the individual here intended,
although he is out of his place, for he was the son, not the father, of
Śuddhodana, and the father of Ráhula; as he is termed in the Amara <span
id="page_464">p. 464</span> and Haima Koshas, Śaudhodani or Śuddhodana
suta the son of Śuddhodana, and Ráhulasú the parent of Ráhula: so also
in the Maháwanśo, Siddhártha or Śákya is the son of Śuddhodano, and
father of Ráhulo. Turnour's translation, p. 9. Whether they are rightly
included amongst the princes of the race of Ikshwáku is more
questionable; for Śuddhodana is usually described as a petty prince,
whose capital was not Ayodhyá, but Kapila or Kapilavastu. At the same
time it appears that the provinces of the Doab had passed into the
possession of princes of the lunar line, and the children of the sun may
have been reduced to the country north of the Ganges, or the modern
Gorakhpur, in which Kapila was situated. The Buddhists do usually
consider their teacher Śákya to be descended from Ikshwáku. The
chronology is less easily adjusted, but it is not altogether
incompatible. According to the lists of the text, Śákya, as the
twenty-second of the line of Ikshwáku, is cotemporary with Ripunjaya,
the twenty-second and last of the kings of Magadhá, of the family of
Jarásandha; but, agreeably to the Buddhist authorities, he was the
friend of Bimbasára, a king who in the Pauráńik list appears to be the
fifth of the Śaiśunága dynasty, and tenth from Ripunjaya. The same
number of princes does not necessarily imply equal duration of dynasty,
and Ikshwáku's descendants may have outlasted those of Jarásandha; or,
as is more likely--for the dynasty was obscure, and is evidently
imperfectly preserved--several descents may have been omitted, the
insertion of which would reconcile the Pauráńik lists with those of the
Buddhists, and bring Śákya down to the age of Bimbasára. It is evident,
from what occurs in other authorities, that the Aikshwákava princes are
regarded as cotemporaries even of the Śaiśunága dynasty: see c. 24. n.
17.

<span id="fn_1328"></span>[464:21](vp115.htm#fr_1328.md) Kshulika: Váyu.
Kulaka or Kshullaka: Mats. Omitted: Bhág. In the Mahávíra Charitra, a
work written by the celebrated Hemachandra, in the twelfth century, we
have a Prasenajit, king of Magadhá, residing at Rajgriha, succeeded by
Śreníka, and he by Kúlika. The Bauddhas have a Prasenajit cotemporary
with Śákya, son of Mahápadma, king of Magadhá. There is some confusion
of persons either in the Pauráńik genealogies or in the Buddhist and
Jain traditions, but they agree in bringing the same names together
about the same period.

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[464:22](vp115.htm#fr_1329.md) Omitted: Bhág.

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[464:23](vp115.htm#fr_1330.md) The Váyu and
Bhágavata have the same stanza. We have here twenty-nine or thirty
princes of the later solar line, cotemporary with the preceding
twenty-six or twenty-seven of the later dynasty of the moon.
