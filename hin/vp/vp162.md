### CHAP. VII.

Keśidhwaja describes the nature of ignorance, and the benefits of the
Yoga, or contemplative devotion. Of the novice and the adept in the
performance of the Yoga. How it is performed. The first stage,
proficiency in acts of restraint and moral duty: the second, particular
mode of sitting: the third, Pránáyáma, modes of breathing: the fourth,
Pratyáhára, restraint of thought: the fifth, apprehension of spirit: the
sixth, retention of the idea. Meditation on the individual and universal
forms of Vishńu. Acquirement of knowledge. Final liberation.

"BUT," said Keśidhwaja, "why have you not asked of me my kingdom, now
free from all annoyance? what else except dominion is acceptable to the
warrior race?" "I will tell you," replied Kháńd́ikya, "why I did not make
such a demand, nor require that territory which is an object of ignorant
ambition. It is the duty of the warrior to protect his subjects in
peace, and to kill in fight the enemies of his sway. It is no fault that
you should have taken my kingdom from one who was unable to defend it,
to whom it was a bondage, and who was thus freed from the incumbrance of
ignorance. My desire of dominion originated in my being born to possess
it: the ambition of others, which proceeds from human frailties, is not
compatible with virtue. To solicit gifts is not the duty of a prince and
warrior: and for these reasons I have not asked for your kingdom, nor
made a demand which ignorance alone would have suggested. Those only who
are destitute of knowledge, whose minds are engrossed by selfishness,
who are intoxicated with the inebriating beverage of self-sufficiency,
desire kingdoms; not such as I am."

When king Keśidhwaja heard these words, he was much pleased, and
exclaimed, "It is well spoken!" Then addressing Kháńd́ikya
affectionately, he said, "Listen to my words. Through desire of escaping
death by the ignorance of works I exercise the regal power, celebrate
various sacrifices, and enjoy pleasures subversive of purity. Fortunate
is it for you that your mind has attached itself to the dominion of
discrimination. Pride of your race! now listen to the real nature of
ignorance. The (erroneous) notion that self consists in what is not
self, and the

<span id="page_650">p. 650</span>

opinion that property consists in what is not one's own, constitute the
double seed of the tree of ignorance. The ill judging embodied being,
bewildered by the darkness of fascination, situated in a body composed
of the five elements, loudly asserts, 'This is I:' but who would ascribe
spiritual individuality to a body in which soul is distinct from the
ether, air, fire, water, and earth (of which that body is
composed) <span id="fr_1636"></span>[1](#fn_1636.md)? What man of
understanding assigns to disembodied spirit corporeal fruition, or
lands, houses, and the like, that it should say, 'These are mine?' What
wise man entertains the idea of property in sous or grandsons begotten
of the body after the spirit has abandoned it? Man performs all acts for
the purpose of bodily fruition, and the consequence of such acts is
another body; so that their result is nothing but confinement to bodily
existence. In the same manner as a mansion of clay is plastered with
clay and water, so the body, which is of earth, is perpetuated by earth
and water (or by eating and drinking). The body, consisting of the five
elements, is nourished by substances equally composed of those elements:
but since this is the case, what is there in this life that man should
be proud of? Travelling the path of the world for many thousands of
births, man attains only the weariness of bewilderment, and is smothered
by the dust of imagination. When that dust is washed away by the bland
water of real knowledge, then the weariness of bewilderment sustained by
the wayfarer through repeated births is removed. When that weariness is
relieved, the internal man is at peace, and he obtains that supreme
felicity which is unequalled and undisturbed. This soul is (of its own
nature) pure, and composed of happiness and wisdom. The properties of
pain, ignorance, and impurity, are those of nature (Prakriti), not of
soul. There is no affinity between fire and water, but when the latter
is placed over the former in a caldron it bubbles and boils, and

<span id="page_651">p. 651</span>

exhibits the properties of fire. In like manner, when soul is associated
with Prakriti it is vitiated by egotism and the rest, and assumes the
qualities of grosser nature, although essentially distinct from them,
and incorruptible. Such is the seed of ignorance, as I have explained it
to you. There is but one cure of worldly sorrows, the practice of
devotion; no other is known."

"Then," said Kháńd́ikya, "do you, who are the chief of those versed in
contemplative devotion, explain to me what that is; for in the race of
the descendants of Nimi <span id="fr_1637"></span>[2](#fn_1637.md) you are
best acquainted with the sacred writings in which it is taught." "Hear,"
replied Keśidhwaja, "the account of, the nature of contemplative
devotion <span id="fr_1638"></span>[3](#fn_1638.md), which I impart to you,
and by perfection in which the sage attains resolution into Brahma, and
never suffers birth again. The mind of man is the cause both of his
bondage and his liberation: its addiction to the objects of sense is the
means of his bondage; its separation from objects of sense is the means
of his freedom. The sage who is capable of discriminative knowledge must
therefore restrain his mind from all the objects of sense, and therewith
meditate upon the supreme being, who is one with spirit, in order to
attain liberation; for that supreme spirit attracts to itself him who
meditates upon it, and who is of the same nature, as the loadstone
attracts the iron by the virtue which is common to itself and to its
products <span id="fr_1639"></span>[4](#fn_1639.md).

<span id="page_652">p. 652</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Contemplative
devotion is the union with Brahma, effected by that condition of mind
which has attained perfection through those exercises which complete the
control of self <span id="fr_1640"></span>[5](#fn_1640.md): and he whose
contemplative devotion is characterized by the property of such absolute
perfection, is in truth a sage, expectant of final liberation from the
world.

"The sage, or Yogi, when first applying himself to contemplative
devotion is called the novice or practitioner (Yoga yuj); when he has
attained spiritual union he is termed the adept, or he whose meditations
are accomplished <span id="fr_1641"></span>[6](#fn_1641.md). Should the
thoughts of the former be unvitiated by any obstructing imperfection, he
will obtain freedom, after practising devotion through several
lives <span id="fr_1642"></span>[7](#fn_1642.md). The latter speedily
obtains liberation in that existence (in which he reaches perfection),
all his acts being consumed by the fire of contemplative devotion. The
sage who would bring his mind into a fit state for the performance of
devout contemplation

<span id="page_653">p. 653</span>

must be devoid of desire, and observe invariably continence, compassion,
truth, honesty, and disinterestedness: he must fix his mind intently on
the supreme Brahma, practising holy study, purification, contentment,
penance, and self-control. These virtues, respectively termed the five
acts of restraint (Yana), and five of obligation (Niyama), bestow
excellent rewards when practised for the sake of reward, and eternal
liberation when they are not prompted by desire (of transient benefits).
Endowed with these merits, the sage self restrained should sit in one of
the modes termed Bhadrásana, &c., and engage in contemplation <span
id="fr_1643"></span>[8](#fn_1643.md). Bringing his vital airs, called
Práńá, under subjection, by frequent repetition, is thence called
Práńáyáma, which is as it were a seed with a seed <span
id="fr_1644"></span>[9](#fn_1644.md). In this the breath of expiration and
that of inspiration are alternately obstructed, constituting the act
twofold; and the suppression of both modes of breathing produces a
third <span id="fr_1645"></span>[10](#fn_1645.md). The exercise of the
Yogi, whilst endeavouring to bring before his thoughts the gross form of
the eternal, is denominated Álambana <span
id="fr_1646"></span>[11](#fn_1646.md). He is then to perform the
Pratyáhára, which consists in restraining his organs of sense from
susceptibility to outward impressions, and directing them entirely to
mental perceptions. By these means the entire subjugation of the
unsteady senses is effected; and if they are not controlled, the sage
will not accomplish his devotions. When by the Práńáyáma the vital airs

<span id="page_654">p. 654</span>

are restrained, and the senses are subjugated by the Pratyáhára, then
the sage will he able to keep his mind steady in its perfect asylum."

Kháńd́ikya then said to Keśidhwaja, "Illustrious sage, inform me what is
that perfect asylum of the mind, resting on which it destroys all the
products of (human) infirmity." To this, Keśidhwaja replied, "The asylum
of mind is spirit (Brahma), which of its own nature is twofold, as being
with or without form; and each of these is supreme and secondary <span
id="fr_1647"></span>[12](#fn_1647.md). Apprehension of spirit <span
id="fr_1648"></span>[13](#fn_1648.md), again, is threefold. I will explain
the different kinds to you: they are, that which is called Brahma, that
which is named from works, and that which comprehends both. That mental
apprehension which consists of Brahma is one; that which is formed of
works is another; and that which comprehends both is the third: so that
mental apprehension (of the object or asylum of the thoughts) is
threefold. Sanandana and other (perfect sages) were endowed with
apprehension of the nature of Brahma. The gods and others, whether
animate or inanimate, are possessed of that which regards acts. The
apprehension that comprehends both works and spirit exists in
Hirańyagarbha and others, who are possessed of contemplative knowledge
of their own nature, and who also exercise certain active functions, as
creation and the rest. Until all acts, which are the causes of notions
of individuality, are discontinued, spirit is one thing, and the
universe is another, to those who contemplate objects as distinct and
various; but that is called true knowledge, or knowledge of Brahma,
which recognises no distinctions, which contemplates only simple
existence, which is

<span id="page_655">p. 655</span>

undefinable by words, and is to be discovered solely in one's own
spirit. That is the supreme, unborn, imperishable form of Vishńu, who is
without (sensible) form, and is characterised as a condition of the
supreme soul, which is variously modified from the condition of
universal form. But this condition cannot be contemplated by sages in
their (early) devotions, and they must therefore direct their minds to
the gross form of Hari, which is of universal perceptibility. They must
meditate upon him as Hirańyagarbha, as the glorious Vásava, as
Prajápati, as the winds, the Vasus, the Rudras, the suns, stars,
planets, Gandharbas, Yakshas, Daityas, all the gods and their
progenitors, men, animals, mountains, oceans, rivers, trees, all beings,
and all sources of beings, all modifications whatever of nature and its
products, whether sentient or unconscious, one-footed, two-footed, or
many-footed; all these are the sensible form of Hari, to be apprehended
by the three kinds of apprehension. All this universal world, this world
of moving and stationary beings, is pervaded by the energy of Vishńu,
who is of the nature of the supreme Brahma. This energy is either
supreme, or, when it is that of conscious embodied spirit, it is
secondary. Ignorance, or that which is denominated from works, is a
third energy <span id="fr_1649"></span>[14](#fn_1649.md); by which the
omnipresent energy of embodied spirit is ever excited, and whence it
suffers all the pains of repeated worldly existence. Obscured by that
energy (of ignorance or illusion), the energy that is denominated from
embodied spirit is characterised by different degrees of perfection in
all created beings. In things without life it exists in a very small
degree: it is more in things that have life, but are (without motion):
in insects it is still more abundant, and still more in birds; it is
more in wild animals, and in domestic animals the faculty is still
greater: men have more of this (spiritual). faculty than animals, and
thence arises their authority over

<span id="page_656">p. 656</span>

them: the faculty exists in an ascending degree in Nágas, Gandharbas,
Yakshas, gods, Śakra, Prajápati, and Hirańyagarbha: and is above all
predominant in that male (Vishńu) of whom all these various creatures
are but the diversified forms, penetrated universally by his energy, as
all-pervading as the ether.

"The second <span id="fr_1650"></span>[15](#fn_1650.md) state of him who is
called Vishńu, and which is to be meditated upon by the (advanced) sage,
is that imperceptible, shapeless form of Brahma, which is called by the
wise, 'That which is <span id="fr_1651"></span>[16](#fn_1651.md),' and in
which all the before described energies reside. Thence proceeds the form
of the universal form, the other great form of Hari, which is the origin
of those manifested forms (or incarnations) that are endowed with every
kind of energy, and which, whether the forms of gods, animals, or men,
are assumed by him (Hari) in his sport. This active interposition of the
undefinable god, all-comprehending and irresistible, is for the purpose
of benefiting the world, and is not the necessary consequence of works.
This form of the universal form is to be meditated upon by the sage for
the object of purification, as it destroys all sin. In the same manner
as fire, blazing in the wind, burns dry grass, so Vishńu, seated in the
heart, consumes the sins of the sage; and therefore let him resolutely
effect the fixation of his mind upon that receptacle of all the three
energies (Vishńu), for that is the operation of the mind which is called
perfect Dháraná <span id="fr_1652"></span>[17](#fn_1652.md): and thus the
perfect asylum of individual as well as universal spirit, that which is
beyond the three modes of apprehension, is attained, for the eternal
emancipation of the sage. The minds of other beings, which are not fixed
upon that asylum, are altogether impure, and are all the gods and the
rest, who spring from acts. The retention or apprehension by the mind of
that visible form of Vishńu, without regard to subsidiary forms, is
thence called Dháraná; and I will describe to you the perceptible form
of Hari, which no mental retention

<span id="page_657">p. 657</span>

will manifest, except in a mind that is fit to become the receptacle of
the idea <span id="fr_1653"></span>[18](#fn_1653.md). The meditating sage
must think (he beholds internally the figure) of Vishńu, as having a
pleased and lovely countenance, with eyes like the leaf of the lotus,
smooth cheeks, and a broad and brilliant forehead; ears of equal size,
the lobes of which are decorated with splendid pendants; a painted neck,
and a broad breast, on which shines the Srivatsa mark; a belly falling
in graceful folds, with a deep-seated navel; eight long arms, or else
four; and firm and well-knit thighs and legs, with well-formed feet and
toes. Let him, with well-governed thoughts, contemplate, as long as he
can persevere in unremitting attention, Hari as clad in a yellow robe,
wearing a rich diadem on his head, and brilliant armlets and bracelets
on his arms, and bearing in his hands the bow, the shell, the mace, the
sword, the discus, the rosary, the lotus, and the arrow <span
id="fr_1654"></span>[19](#fn_1654.md). When this image never departs from
his mind, whether he be going or standing, or be engaged in any other
voluntary act, then he may believe his retention to be perfect. The sage
may then meditate upon the form of Vishńu without his arms, as the
shell, mace, discus, and bow; and as placid, and bearing only his
rosary. When the idea of this image is firmly retained, then he may
meditate on Vishńu without his diadem, bracelets, or other ornaments. He
may next contemplate him as having but one single limb, and may then fix
his whole thoughts upon the body to which the limbs belong. This process
of forming a lively image in the mind, exclusive of all other objects,
constitutes Dhyána, or meditation, which is perfected by six
stages <span id="fr_1655"></span>[20](#fn_1655.md); and when an accurate
knowledge of self, free from all distinction, is attained by this mental
meditation, that is termed Samádhi <span
id="fr_1656"></span>[21](#fn_1656.md).

<span id="page_658">p. 658</span>

"(When the Yogi has accomplished this stage, he acquires) discriminative
knowledge, which is the means of enabling living soul, when all the
three kinds of apprehension are destroyed, to attain the attainable
supreme Brahma <span id="fr_1657"></span>[22](#fn_1657.md). Embodied spirit
is the user of the instrument, which instrument is true knowledge; and
by it that (identification) of the former (with Brahma) is
attained <span id="fr_1658"></span>[23](#fn_1658.md). Liberation, which is
the object to be effected, being accomplished, discriminative knowledge
ceases. When endowed with the apprehension of the nature of the object
of inquiry, then, there is no difference between it (individual and)
supreme spirit: difference is the consequence of the absence of (true)
knowledge. When that ignorance which is the cause of the difference
between individual and universal spirit is destroyed finally and for
ever, who shall ever make that distinction between them which does not
exist? Thus have I, Kháńd́ikya, in reply to your question, explained to
you what is meant by contemplative devotion, both fully and summarily.
What else do you wish to hear?"

Kháńd́ikya replied to Keśidhwaja, and said, "The explanation which you
have given me of the real nature of contemplative devotion has fulfilled
all my wishes, and removed all impurity from my mind. The expression
'mine,' which I have been accustomed to use, is untruth, and

<span id="page_659">p. 659</span>

cannot be otherwise declared by those who know what is to be known. The
words 'I' and 'mine' constitute ignorance; but practice is influenced by
ignorance. Supreme truth cannot be defined, for it is not to be
explained by words. Depart therefore, Keśidhwaja; you have done all that
is necessary for my real happiness, in teaching me contemplative
devotion, the inexhaustible bestower of liberation from existence."

Accordingly king Keśidhwaja, after receiving suitable homage from
Kháńd́ikya, returned to his city. Kháńd́ikya, having nominated his son
Rájá <span id="fr_1659"></span>[24](#fn_1659.md), retired to the woods to
accomplish his devotions, his whole mind being intent upon Govinda:
there his entire thoughts being engrossed upon one only object, and
being purified by practices of restraint, self-control, and the rest, he
obtained absorption into the pure and perfect spirit which is termed
Vishńu. Keśidhwaja also, in order to attain liberation, became averse
from his own perishable works, and lived amidst objects of sense
(without regarding them), and instituted religious rites without
expecting therefrom any advantages to himself. Thus by pure and
auspicious fruition, being cleansed from all sin, the also obtained that
perfection which assuages all affliction for ever.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1636"></span>[650:1](vp162.htm#fr_1636.md) The text is
somewhat obscure, but it is in some degree cleared up by the next
illustration. No one would think of applying the property of self--the
idea of possession or personality--to soul, separated from body: but the
objection is equally applicable to soul in the body; for whilst there it
is as distinct in its nature from the materials of body as if it was
disembodied, and quite as incapable of individual personal fruition.

<span id="fn_1637"></span>[651:2](vp162.htm#fr_1637.md) That is, in the
race of princes of Mithilá.

<span id="fn_1638"></span>[651:3](vp162.htm#fr_1638.md) The term Yoga,
which is that used in the text, in its literal acceptation signifies
'union,' 'junction,' from \#\#\# 'to join:' in a spiritual sense it
denotes 'union of separated with universal soul; and with some latitude
of expression it comes to signify the means by which such union is
affected. In the Bhagavad Gítá it is variously applied, but ordinarily
denotes the performance of religious ceremonies as a duty, and not for
interested purposes. Thus Krishńa says to Arjuna, "Engaging in Yoga,
perform rites, Dhananjaya, being indifferent to success or failure: such
indifference is called Yoga." II. v. 48. It is elsewhere defined,
'exemption from the contact of pain:' VI. v. 23. The word has been
accordingly rendered 'devotion' by Wilkins, and 'devotio' by Schlegel,
in their translations of the Gítá. In this place, however, it is used in
a less general sense, and signifies, as is subsequently explained,
reunion with spirit through the exercises necessary to perfect
abstraction as they are taught and practised by the followers of
Patanjali.

<span id="fn_1639"></span>[651:4](vp162.htm#fr_1639.md) This illustration
is however only to a <span id="page_652">p. 652</span> limited extent,
explanatory of the nature of Yoga; for though the loadstone and iron
unite, by virtue of a community of kind, yet the union that takes place
is only that of contiguity, Samyoga not that of identification or unity,
Tadaikyam. Some further explanation therefore is required.

<span id="fn_1640"></span>[652:5](vp162.htm#fr_1640.md) The first stage is
the Átma prayatna, the practice of moral and religious restraint, Yama,
Niyama, &c. When the novice is perfect in these, then he is fit to
attain the perfectibility of an adept, through the especial practices
which treatises on the Yoga prescribe. When the mind has attained the
state which can alone be attained through them, then the union with
Brahma, which is the consequence, is called Yoga: \#\#\#. The Átma
prayatna is defined to be that which has Yama, &c. for its object. The
next phrase is explained, 'depending upon, or relating to, such
control.' \#\#\# is the same as \#\#\# condition or state of mind which
is \#\#\# perfected: of that state of mind, union with Brahma, is Yoga.
Union with Brahma is the abstraction that proposes the identity of the
living with the supreme spirit of the Jívátma, with Brahma; and Yoga is
understanding of the identity of the contemplator and the object
contemplated. A text of Yajnyawalkya is quoted to this effect: 'Know
holy wisdom to be the same with Yoga, (the practice of) which has eight
divisions. That which is termed Yoga is union of the living with the
supreme soul.'

<span id="fn_1641"></span>[652:6](vp162.htm#fr_1641.md) Vinishpannasamádhi
is the expression of the text, which can scarcely be regarded as an
appellative. The commentator terms the adept Brahmajnáni, 'He who knows
Brahma.'

<span id="fn_1642"></span>[652:7](vp162.htm#fr_1642.md) After three lives,
according to the Váyu Sanhitá, as quoted in the comment.

<span id="fn_1643"></span>[653:8](vp162.htm#fr_1643.md) There are various
postures in which the Yogi is directed to sit when he engages in
meditation. In the Bhadrásana he is directed to cross his legs
underneath him, and to lay hold of his feet on each side with his hands.

<span id="fn_1644"></span>[653:9](vp162.htm#fr_1644.md) It is itself
figuratively the seed of the fruit, which is meditation; but it is to be
accompanied with what is also technically called Bíja, or seed,
inaudible repetition of certain prayers, and meditation on the visible
form of the deity, termed likewise Álambana, and presently mentioned.

<span id="fn_1645"></span>[653:10](vp162.htm#fr_1645.md) Práńáyáma is
performed by three modifications of breathing: the first act is
expiration, which is performed through the right nostril, whilst the
left is closed with the fingers of the right hand; this is called
Rechaka: the thumb is then placed upon the right nostril, and the
fingers raised from the left, through which breath is inhaled; this is
called Púraka: in the third act both nostrils are closed, and breathing
suspended; this is Kumbhaka: and a succession of these operations is the
practice of Práńáyáma.

<span id="fn_1646"></span>[653:11](vp162.htm#fr_1646.md) Álambana is the
silent repetition of prayer.

<span id="fn_1647"></span>[654:12](vp162.htm#fr_1647.md) The Brahma that is
without form (Amúrtta) may be Para or Apara. Supreme formless spirit is,
without attributes of any kind. Secondary formless spirit is invested
with the attributes of power, glory, truth, perfection. Spirit embodied,
or with form in his highest state, is, according to our text, Vishńu,
and his manifestations. Spirit in an inferior or secondary series of
bodily forms is Brahmá and all other living beings.

<span id="fn_1648"></span>[654:13](vp162.htm#fr_1648.md) The term is
Bhávaná, defined to be, 'function to be engendered by knowledge;' the
mental impression or apprehension following upon knowledge.' Here it
implies in particular the formation of a fixed idea by the Yogi of the
object of his contemplations. It is also termed Bháva-bhávaná,
'apprehension of the being, the existence, or substantiality, of the
object; the thing contemplated.'

<span id="fn_1649"></span>[655:14](vp162.htm#fr_1649.md) The term used
throughout is Śakti, power,' 'ability,' 'energy' By the first kind, or
Pará, is understood knowledge able to appreciate abstract truth, or the
nature of universal soul; by the second, ability to understand the
nature of embodied soul; and by the third, inability to discern one's
own nature, and reliance on moral or ceremonial merit. These different
kinds are called energies, because they are the energies or faculties of
the supreme spirit, or, according to the Vaishńavas, of Vishńu,
accompanying soul in all its various conditions of existence.

<span id="fn_1650"></span>[656:15](vp162.htm#fr_1650.md) The first, which
has been intended to be described in the foregoing passages, was the
universal, visible form of Vishńu; the second is his formless or
imperceptible condition.

<span id="fn_1651"></span>[656:16](vp162.htm#fr_1651.md) Sat 'what is
being.'

<span id="fn_1652"></span>[656:17](vp162.htm#fr_1652.md) Retention, or
holding of the image or idea formed in the mind by contemplation: from
Dhri, 'to hold,' literally or figuratively.

<span id="fn_1653"></span>[657:18](vp162.htm#fr_1653.md) The explanation of
Dhárańá given in the text is rendered unnecessarily perplexed by the
double doctrine here taught, and the attempt to combine the abstractions
of Yoga theism with the sectarian worship of Vishńu.

<span id="fn_1654"></span>[657:19](vp162.htm#fr_1654.md) The two last
implements are from the comment; the text specifies only six.

<span id="fn_1655"></span>[657:20](vp162.htm#fr_1655.md) They are, 1. Yama
&c., acts of restraint and obligation; 2. Ásana, sitting in particular
postures; 3. Prańáyáma, modes of breathing; 4. Pratyáhára, exclusion of
all external ideas; 5. Bhávaná, apprehension of internal ideas; 6.
Dhárańá, fixation or retention of those ideas.

<span id="fn_1656"></span>[657:21](vp162.htm#fr_1656.md) The result of the
Dhyána or Samádhi is the absence of all idea of individuality, when the
meditator, the meditation, and <span id="page_658">p. 658</span> the
thing or object meditated upon, are all considered to be but one.
According to the text of Patanjali: 'Restraint of the body, retention of
the mind, and meditation, which thence is exclusively confined to one
object, is Dhyána: the idea of identification with the object of such
meditation, so as if devoid of individual nature, is Samádhi.'

<span id="fn_1657"></span>[658:22](vp162.htm#fr_1657.md) The expressions of
the text are somewhat obscure, nor does the commentator make them much
more intelligible, until he cuts the matter short by stating the meaning
to be, that 'discriminative knowledge enables the living spirit to
attain Brahma.'

<span id="fn_1658"></span>[658:23](vp162.htm#fr_1658.md) The text is very
elliptical and obscure. Having stated that embodied spirit (Kshetrajna)
is the Karańin, the possessor or user of the Karana, which is knowledge,
it adds, \#\#\# literally, 'by that, of that, that;' i. e. Tat, 'that
which is; and Brahma, or supreme spirit, is the attainment of that
spirit which abides in body by that instrument, or discriminative
knowledge, of which it has become possessed through perfect meditation.

<span id="fn_1659"></span>[659:24](vp162.htm#fr_1659.md) The commentator,
in order to explain how Kháńd́ikya should have given what he did not
possess, states that it is to be understood that Keśidhwaja relinquished
to him the kingdom; or the term Rájá may denote merely, master of, or
acquainted with, mystic prayers, or Mantras.
