<p>15. K&uacute;rma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. "That in which Jan&aacute;rddana, in the form of a tortoise, in the regions under the earth, explained the objects of life--duty, wealth, pleasure, and liberation--in communication with Indradyumna and the Rishis in the proximity of &#346;akra, which refers to the Lakshm&iacute; Kalpa, and contains seventeen thousand stanzas, is the K&uacute;rma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">76</FONT></A>."</p>  
<p>In the first chapter of the K&uacute;rma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a it gives an account of itself, which does not exactly agree with this description. S&uacute;ta, who is repeating the narration, is made to say to the Rishis, "This most excellent Kaurma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is the fifteenth. Sanhit&aacute;s are fourfold, from the variety of the collections. The Br&aacute;hm&iacute;, Bh&aacute;gavat&iacute;, Saur&iacute;, and Vaishn&#769;av&iacute;, are well known as the four Sanhit&aacute;s which confer virtue, wealth, pleasure, and liberation. This is the Br&aacute;hm&iacute; Sanhit&aacute;, conformable to the four Vedas; in which there are six thousand &#347;lokas, and by it the importance of the four objects of life, O great sages, holy knowledge and Parame&#347;wara is known." There is an irreconcilable difference in this specification of the number of stanzas and that given above. It is not very clear what is meant by a Sanhit&aacute; as here used. A Sanhit&aacute;, as observed above (p. xi), is something different from a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. It may be an assemblage of prayers and legends, extracted professedly from a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, but is not usually applicable to the original. The four Sanhit&aacute;s here specified refer rather to their religious character than to their connexion with any specific work, and in fact the same terms are applied to what are called Sanhit&aacute;s of the Sk&aacute;nda. In this sense a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a might be also a Sanhit&aacute;; that is, it might be an assemblage of formul&aelig; and legends belonging to a division of the Hindu system; and the work in question, like the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, does adopt both titles. It says, "This is the excellent Kaurma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, the fifteenth (of the series):" and again, "This is the Br&aacute;hm&iacute; Sanhit&aacute;." At any rate, no other work has been met with pretending to be the K&uacute;rma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a.</p>

<p>With regard to the other particulars specified by the Matsya, traces of them are to be found. Although in two accounts of the traditional communication of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;a no mention is made of Vishn&#769;u as one of the teachers, yet S&uacute;ta repeats at the outset a dialogue between Vishn&#769;u, as the K&uacute;rma, and Indradyumna, at the time of the churning of the ocean; and much of the subsequent narrative is put into the mouth of the former.</p>  
<p>The name, being that of an Avat&aacute;ra of Vishn&#769;u, might lead us to expect a Vaishn&#769;ava work; but it is always and correctly classed with the &#346;aiva. Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, the greater portion of it inculcating the worship of &#346;iva and Durg&aacute;. It is divided into two parts, of nearly equal length. In the first part, accounts of the creation, of the Avat&aacute;ras of Vishn&#769;u, of the solar and lunar dynasties of the kings to the time of Krishn&#769;a, of the universe, and of the Manwantaras, are given, in general in a summary manner, but not unfrequently in the words employed in the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. With these are blended hymns addressed to Mahe&#347;wara by Brahm&aacute; and others; the defeat of Andhak&aacute;sura by Bhairava; the origin of four &#346;aktis, Mahe&#347;war&iacute;, &#346;iv&aacute;, &#346;at&iacute;, and Haimavat&iacute;, from &#346;iva; and other &#346;aiva legends. One chapter gives a more distinct and connected account of the incarnations of &#346;iva in the present age than the Linga; and it wears still more the appearance of an attempt to identify the teachers of the Yoga school with personations of their preferential deity. Several chapters form a K&aacute;&#347;&iacute; M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya, a legend of Benares. In the second part there are no legends. It is divided into two parts, the &Iacute;&#347;wara G&iacute;ta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">77</FONT></A> and Vy&aacute;sa Gita. In the former the knowledge of god, that is, of &#346;iva, through contemplative devotion, is taught. In the latter the same object is enjoined through works, or observance of the ceremonies and precepts of the Vedas.</p>  
<p>The date of the K&uacute;rma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a cannot be very remote, for it is avowedly posterior to the establishment of the T&aacute;ntrika, the S&aacute;kta, and the Jain sects. In the twelfth chapter it is said, "The Bhairava, V&aacute;ma, &Aacute;rhata, and Y&aacute;mala &#346;&aacute;stras are intended for delusion." There is no</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_li"><font size="1" color="green">p. li</font></A></p>  
<p>reason to believe that the Bhairava and Y&aacute;mala Tantras are very ancient works, or that the practices of the left-hand &#346;&aacute;ktas, or the doctrines of Arhat or Jina were known in the early centuries of our era.</p>
