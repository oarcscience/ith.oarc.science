### CHAP. XXXIV.

Pauńd́raka, a Vásudeva, assumes the insignia and style of Krishńa,
supported by the king of Káśí. Krishńa marches against, and destroys
them. The son of the king sends a magical being against Krishńa:
destroyed by his discus, which also sets Benares on fire, and consumes
it and its inhabitants.

MAITREYA.--Of a truth the divine Śauri, having assumed a mortal body,
performed great achievements in his easy victories over Śakra and Śiva,
and all their attendant divinities. I am now desirous to hear from you,
illustrious sage, what other mighty exploit the humiliator of the
prowess of the celestials performed.

PARÁŚARA.--Hear, excellent Brahman, with reverent attention, an account
of the burning of Varáńasí by Krishńa, in the course of his relieving
the burdens of the earth.

There was a Vásudeva who was called Pauńd́raka <span
id="fr_1557"></span>[1](#fn_1557), and who, though not *the* Vásudeva,
was flattered by ignorant people as the descended deity, until he
fancied himself to be the Vásudeva <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[2](#fn_1558) who had come down upon earth. Losing
all recollection of his real character, he assumed the emblems of
Vishńu, and sent an ambassador to the magnanimous Krishńa with this
message; "Relinquish, thou foolish fellow, the discus; lay aside all my
insignia, my name, and the character of Vásudeva; and come and do me
homage; and I will vouchsafe thee means of subsistence." At which
Janárddana laughed, and replied, "Go, messenger, back to Pauńd́raka, and
say to him from me, 'I will dispatch to thee my emblem the discus
without fail. Thou wilt rightly apprehend my meaning, and consider what
is to be done; for I shall come to thy city, bringing the discus with
me, and shall undoubtedly consign it to thee. If thou wilt command me to
come, I will immediately obey, and be with

<span id="page_598">p. 598</span>

thee to-morrow; there shall be no delay: and, having sought thy asylum,
I will so provide, O king, that I shall never more have any thing to
dread from thee.'" So saying, he dismissed the, ambassador to report
these words to his sovereign; and summoning Garud́a, mounted him, and set
off for the city of Pauńd́raka <span id="fr_1559"></span>[3](#fn_1559).

When the king of Káśí heard of the preparations of Keśava, he sent his
army (to the aid of Pauńd́raka), himself bringing up the rear; and with
the force of the king of Káśí, and his own troops, Pauńd́raka, the false
Vásudeva, marched to meet Krishńa. Hari beheld him afar off, standing in
his car, holding a discus, a club, a mace, a scimitar, and a lotus, in
his hands; ornamented with a garland of flowers; bearing a bow; and
having his standard made of gold: he had also the Srivatsa mark
delineated on his breast; he was dressed in yellow garments, and
decorated with earrings and a tiara. When the god whose standard is
Garud́a beheld him, he laughed with a deep laugh, and engaged in conflict
with the hostile host of cavalry and elephants, fighting with swords,
scimitars, maces, tridents, spears, and bows. Showering upon the enemy
the shafts from his Śáranga bow, and hurling at them his mace and
discus, he quickly destroyed both the army of Pauńd́raka and that of the
king of Káśí. He then said to the former, who was foolishly wearing his
emblems, "Pauńd́raka, you desired me by your envoy to resign to you all
my insignia. I now deliver them to you. Here is

<span id="page_599">p. 599</span>

my discus; here I give up my mace; and here is Garud́a, let him mount
upon thy standard." Thus speaking, he let fly the discus and the mace,
by which Pauńd́raka was cut to pieces, and cast on the ground; whilst the
Garud́a on his banner was demolished by the Garud́a of Vishńu. The people,
beholding this sight, exclaimed, "Alas! alas!" but the valiant king of
Káśí, adhering to the imposture of his friend, continued the conflict,
till Śauri decapitated him with his arrows, shooting his head into the
city of Káśí, to the marvel of all the inhabitants. Having thus slain
Pauńd́raka and the king of Káśí, with all their followers, Śauri returned
to Dwáraká, where he lived in the enjoyment of heavenly delights.

When the inhabitants of Káśí saw the head of their king shot into their
city, they were much astonished, and wondered how it could have
happened, and by whom the deed could have been done. Having ascertained
that the king had been killed by Krishńa, the son of the monarch of
Káśí <span id="fr_1560"></span>[4](#fn_1560), together with the priest
of the family, propitiated Śankara; and that deity, well pleased to be
adored in the sacred place Avimukta, desired the prince to demand a
boon: on which he prayed, and said, "O lord, mighty god, through thy
favour let thy mystic spirit arise to destroy Krishńa, the murderer of
my father." "It shall be so," answered Śankara: and from out of the
southern fire upsprang a vast and formidable female <span
id="fr_1561"></span>[5](#fn_1561), like flame out of fire, blazing with
ruddy light, and with fiery radiance streaming amidst her hair. Angrily
she called upon Krishńa, and departed to Dwáraká; where the people,
beholding her, were struck with dismay, and fled for protection to
Madhusúdana, the refuge of all worlds. The wielder of the discus knowing
that the fiend had been produced by the son of the king of Káśí, through
his adoration of the deity whose emblem is a bull, and being engaged in
sportive amusements, and playing at dice, said to the discus, "Kill this
fierce creature, whose tresses are of plaited flame." Accordingly
Sudarśana, the discus

<span id="page_600">p. 600</span>

of Vishńu, immediately attacked the fiend, fearfully enwreathed with
fire, and wearing tresses of plaited flame. Terrified at the might of
Sudarśana, the creation of Maheśwara awaited not his attack, but fled
with speed, pursued by him with equal velocity, until she reached
Varánáśí, repelled by the superior might of the discus of Vishńu.

The army of Káśí, and the host of the demigods attendant upon Śiva,
armed with all kinds of weapons, then sallied out to oppose the discus;
but, skilled in the use of arms, he consumed the whole of the forces by
his radiance, and then set fire to the city, in which the magic power of
Śiva had concealed herself <span id="fr_1562"></span>[6](#fn_1562). Thus
was Varánáśí burnt, with all its princes and their followers, its
inhabitants, elephants, horses, and men, treasures and granaries,
houses, palaces, and markets. The whole of a city, that was inaccessible
to the gods, was thus wrapped in flames by the discus of Hari, and was
totally destroyed. The discus then, with unmitigated wrath, and blazing
fiercely, and far from satisfied with the accomplishment of so easy a
task, returned to the hand of Vishńu <span
id="fr_1563"></span>[7](#fn_1563).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1557"></span>[597:1](vp151.htm#fr_1557) From being, the
commentator says, king of Puńd́ra. The Bhágavata calls him chief of the
Kárúshas; the Padma, king of Káśí; but the Bhágavata, as well as our
text, makes the king of Káśí his friend and ally.

<span id="fn_1558"></span>[597:2](vp151.htm#fr_1558) According to the
Padma P., he propitiates Śiva, and obtains from him the insignia which
constitute a Vásudeva. The different authorities for this legend all use
the term Vásudeva in the sense of a title.

<span id="fn_1559"></span>[598:3](vp151.htm#fr_1559) The Hari V. and
Padma P. send Pauńd́raka to Dwáraká. According to the latter, Nárada
incites Pauńd́raka to the aggression, telling him he cannot be a Vásudeva
till he has overcome Krishńa: he goes, and is killed. The former work,
as usual, enters into particulars of its own invention. Krishńa is
absent on a visit to Śiva at Kailása, and during his absence Pauńd́raka,
assisted by Ekalavya, king of the Nishádas, makes a night attack upon
Dwáraká. They are resisted by the Yádavas under Sátyaki and Balaráma; by
the former of whom Pauńd́raka is repeatedly overthrown, and all but
slain: he requires so much killing, however, that he is likely to obtain
the victory, when Krishńa conies to the aid of his kinsmen, and after a
protracted encounter, described in language employed a hundred times
before, kills his competitor. The whole of the sections called the
Kailása Yátrá, or Krishńa's journey to Kailása, must have been wanting
in the copy used by M. Langlois, as they are not included in his
translation. The chapters of the Hari V. according to his enumeration of
them are 261: my copy has 316.

<span id="fn_1560"></span>[599:4](vp151.htm#fr_1560) The Bhágavata names
him Sudakshińa; the Padma, Dańd́apáni.

<span id="fn_1561"></span>[599:5](vp151.htm#fr_1561) A personified
Krityá, a magical creation. The Padma has the same. The Bhágavata makes
the product of the sacrificial fire a male, and sends him to Dwáraká,
accompanied by a host of Bhútas, Suva's attendant goblins.

<span id="fn_1562"></span>[600:6](vp151.htm#fr_1562) According to the
Bhágavata, the magical being himself destroys Sudakshińa and his priest;
but Sudarśana consumes the people and the city. The Padma ascribes the
destruction of the king and all his city to the discus. The Hari V.
closes its narrative with the death of Pauńd́raka, and makes no mention
of the destruction of Benares. The circumstance is alluded to in a
preceding section (s. 159) by Nárada, when detailing the exploits of
Krishńa.

<span id="fn_1563"></span>[600:7](vp151.htm#fr_1563) In this legend,
again, we have a contest between the followers of Vishńu and Śiva
intimated, as, besides the assistance given by the latter to Pauńd́raka,
Benares--Varánáśí or Atimukta--has been from all time, as it is at
present, the high place of the Śaiva worship. There is also an
indication of a Vaishńava schism, in the competition between Pauńd́ra and
Krishńa for the title of Vásudeva, and the insignia of his divinity.
