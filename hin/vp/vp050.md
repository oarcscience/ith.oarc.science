### CHAP. XV.

The world overrun with trees: they are destroyed by the Prachetasas.
Soma pacifies them, and gives them Márishá to wife: her story: the
daughter of the nymph Pramlochá. Legend of Kańd́u. Márishá's former
history. Daksha the son of the Prachetasas: his different characters:
his sons: his daughters: their marriages and progeny: allusion to
Prahláda, his descendant.

WHILST the Prachetasas were thus absorbed in their devotions, the trees
spread and overshadowed the unprotected earth, and the people perished:
the winds could not blow; the sky was shut out by the forests; and
mankind was unable to labour for ten thousand years. When the sages,
coming forth from the deep, beheld this, they were angry, and, being
incensed, wind and flame issued from their mouths. The strong wind tore
up the trees by their roots, and left them sear and dry, and the fierce
fire consumed them, and the forests were cleared away. When Soma (the
moon), the sovereign of the vegetable world, beheld all except a few of
the trees destroyed, he went to the patriarchs, the Prachetasas, and
said, "Restrain your indignation, princes, and listen to me. I will form
an alliance between you and the trees. Prescient of futurity, I have
nourished with my rays this precious maiden, the daughter of the woods.
She is called Márishá, and is assuredly the offspring of the trees. She
shall be your bride, and the multiplier of the race of Dhruva. From a
portion of your lustre and a portion of mine, oh mighty sages, the
patriarch Daksha shall be born of her, who, endowed with a part of me,
and composed of your vigour, shall be as resplendent as fire, and shall
multiply the human race.

"There was formerly (said Soma) a sage named Kańd́u, eminent in holy
wisdom, who practised pious austerities on the lovely borders of the
Gomati river. The king of the gods sent the nymph Pramlochá to disturb
his penance, and the sweet-smiling damsel diverted the sage from his
devotions. They lived together, in the valley of Mandara, for a hundred
and fifty years; during which, the mind of the Muni was wholly given up
to enjoyment. At the expiration of this period the

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

nymph requested his permission to return to heaven; but the Muni, still
fondly attached to her, prevailed upon her to remain for some time
longer; and the graceful damsel continued to reside for another hundred
years, and delight the great sage by her fascinations. Then again she
preferred her suit to be allowed to return to the abodes of the gods;
and again the Muni desired her to remain. At the expiration of more than
a century the nymph once more said to him, with a smiling countenance,
'Brahman, I depart;' but the Muni, detaining the fine-eyed damsel,
replied, 'Nay, stay yet a little; you will go hence for a long period.'
Afraid of incurring an imprecation, the graceful nymph continued with
the sage for nearly two hundred years more, repeatedly asking his
permission to go to the region of the king of the gods, but as often
desired by him to remain. Dreading to be cursed by him, and excelling in
amiable manners, well knowing also the pain that is inflicted by
separation from an object of affection, she did not quit the Muni, whose
mind, wholly subdued by love, became every day more strongly attached to
her.

"On one occasion the sage was going forth from their cottage in a great
hurry. The nymph asked him where he was going. 'The day,' he replied,
'is drawing fast to a close: I must perform the Sandhya worship, or a
duty will be neglected.' The nymph smiled mirthfully as she rejoined,
'Why do you talk, grave sir, of this day drawing to a close: your day is
a day of many years, a day that must be a marvel to all: explain what
this means.' The Muni said, 'Fair damsel, you came to the river-side at
dawn; I beheld you then, and you then entered my hermitage. It is now
the revolution of evening, and the day is gone. What is the meaning of
this laughter? Tell me the truth.' Pramlochá. answered, 'You say
rightly,' venerable Brahman, 'that I came hither at morning dawn, but
several hundred years have passed since the time of my arrival. This is
the truth.' The Muni, on hearing this, was seized with astonishment, and
asked her how long he had enjoyed her society: to which the nymph
replied, that they had lived together nine hundred and seven years, six
months, and three days. The Muni asked her if she spoke the truth, or if
she was in jest; for it appeared to him that

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

they had spent but one day together: to which Pramlochá replied, that
she should not dare at any time to tell him who lived in the path of
piety an untruth, but particularly when she had been enjoined by him to
inform him what had passed.

"When the Muni, princes, had heard these words, and knew that it was the
truth, he began to reproach himself bitterly, exclaiming, 'Fie, fie upon
me; my penance has been interrupted; the treasure of the learned and the
pious has been stolen from me; my judgment has been blinded: this woman
has been created by some one to beguile me: Brahma is beyond the reach
of those agitated by the waves of infirmity <span
id="fr_278"></span>[1](#fn_278.md). I had subdued my passions, and was
about to attain divine knowledge. This was foreseen by him by whom this
girl has been sent hither. Fie on the passion that has obstructed my
devotions. All the austerities that would have led to acquisition of the
wisdom of the Vedas have been rendered of no avail by passion that is
the road to hell.' The pious sage, having thus reviled himself, turned
to the nymph, who was sitting nigh, and said to her, 'Go, deceitful
girl, whither thou wilt: thou hast performed the office assigned thee by
the monarch of the gods, of disturbing my penance by thy fascinations. I
will not reduce thee to ashes by the fire of my wrath. Seven paces
together is sufficient for the friendship of the virtuous, but thou and
I have dwelt together. And in truth what fault hast thou committed? why
should I be wroth with thee? The sin is wholly mine, in that I could not
subdue my passions: yet fie upon thee, who, to gain favour with Indra,
hast disturbed my devotions; vile bundle of delusion.'

"Thus spoken to by the Muni, Pramlochá stood trembling, whilst big drops
of perspiration started from every pore; till he angrily cried to her,
'Depart, begone.' She then, reproached by him, went forth from his
dwelling, and, passing through the air, wiped the perspiration from her
person with the leaves of the trees. The nymph went from tree to tree,
and as with the dusky shoots that crowned their summits she dried her
limbs, which were covered with moisture, the child she had conceived by

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

the Rishi came forth from the pores of her skin in drops of
perspiration. The trees received the living dews, and the winds
collected them into one mass. "This," said Soma, "I matured by my rays,
and gradually it increased in size, till the exhalation that had rested
on the tree tops became the lovely girl named Márishá. The trees will
give her to you, Prachetasas: let your indignation be appeased. She is
the progeny of Kańd́u, the child of Pramlochá, the nursling of the trees,
the daughter of the wind and of the moon. The holy Kańd́u, after the
interruption of his pious exercises, went, excellent princes, to the
region of Vishńu, termed Purushottama, where, Maitreya <span
id="fr_279"></span>[2](#fn_279.md), with his whole mind he devoted himself
to the adoration of Hari; standing fixed, with uplifted arms, and
repeating the prayers that comprehend the essence of divine truth <span
id="fr_280"></span>[3](#fn_280.md)."

The Prachetasas said, "We are desirous to hear the transcendental

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

prayers, by inaudibly reciting which the pious Kańd́u propitiated
Keśava." On which Soma repeated as follows: "'Vishńu is beyond the
boundary of all things: he is the infinite: he is beyond that which is
boundless: he is above all that is above: he exists as finite truth: he
is the object of the Veda; the limit of elemental being; unappreciable
by the senses; possessed of illimitable might: he is the cause of cause;
the cause of the cause of cause; the cause of finite cause; and in
effects, he, both as every object and agent, preserves the universe: he
is Brahma the lord; Brahma all beings; Brahma the progenitor of all
beings; the imperishable: he is the eternal, undecaying, unborn Brahma,
incapable of increase or diminution: Purushottama is the everlasting,
untreated, immutable Brahma. May the imperfections of my nature be
annihilated through his favour.' Reciting this eulogium, the essence of
divine truth, and propitiating Keśava, Kańd́u obtained final
emancipation.

"Who Márishá was of old I will also relate to you, as the recital of her
meritorious acts will be beneficial to you. She was the widow of a
prince, and left childless at her husband's death: she therefore
zealously worshipped Vishńu, who, being gratified by her adoration,
appeared to her, and desired her to demand a boon; on which she revealed
to him the wishes of her heart. 'I have been a widow, lord,' she
exclaimed, 'even from my infancy, and my birth has been in vain:
unfortunate have I been, and of little use, oh sovereign of the world.
Now therefore I pray thee that in succeeding births I may have
honourable husbands, and a son equal to a patriarch amongst men: may I
be possessed of affluence and beauty: may I he pleasing in the sight of
all: and may I be born out of the ordinary course. Grant these prayers,
oh thou who art propitious to the devout.' Hrishikeśa, the god of gods,
the supreme giver of all blessings, thus prayed to, raised her from her
prostrate attitude, and said, 'In another life you shall have ten
husbands of mighty prowess, and renowned for glorious acts; and you
shall have a son magnanimous and valiant, distinguished by the rank of a
patriarch, from whom the various races of men shall multiply, and by
whose posterity the universe shall be filled. You, virtuous lady, shall
be of marvellous birth, and you shall be endowed with grace and
loveliness, delighting the

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

hearts of men.' Thus having spoken, the deity disappeared, and the
princess was accordingly afterwards born as Márishá, who is given to you
for a wife <span id="fr_281"></span>[4](#fn_281.md)."

Soma having concluded, the Prachetasas took Márishá, as he had enjoined
them, righteously to wife, relinquishing their indignation against the
trees: and upon her they begot the eminent patriarch Daksha, who had (in
a former life) been born as the son of Brahmá <span
id="fr_282"></span>[5](#fn_282.md). This great sage, for the furtherance of
creation, and the increase of mankind, created progeny. Obeying the
command of Brahmá, he made movable and immovable things, bipeds and
quadrupeds; and subsequently, by his will, gave birth to females, ten of
whom he bestowed on Dharma, thirteen on Kaśyapa, and twenty-seven, who
regulate the course of time, on the moon <span
id="fr_283"></span>[6](#fn_283.md). Of these, the gods, the Titans, the
snake-gods, cattle, and birds, the singers and dancers of the courts of
heaven, the spirits of evil, and other beings, were born. From that
period forwards living creatures

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

were engendered by sexual intercourse: before the time of Daksha they
were variously propagated, by the will, by sight, by touch, and by the
influence of religious austerities practised by devout sages and holy
saints.

MAITREYA.--Daksha, as I have formerly heard, was born from the right
thumb of Brahmá: tell me, great Muni, how he was regenerate as the son
of the Prachetasas. Considerable perplexity also arises in my mind, how
he, who, as the son of Márishá, was the grandson of Soma, could be also
his father-in-law.

PARÁŚARA.--Birth and death are constant in all creatures: Rishis and
sages, possessing divine vision, are not perplexed by this. Daksha and
the other eminent Munis are present in every age, and in the interval of
destruction cease to be <span id="fr_284"></span>[7](#fn_284.md): of this
the wise man entertains no doubt. Amongst them of old there was neither
senior nor junior; rigorous penance and acquired power were the sole
causes of any difference of degree amongst these more than human beings.

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

MAITREYA.--Narrate to me, venerable Brahman, at length, the birth of the
gods, Titans, Gandharbas, serpents, and goblins.

PARÁŚARA.--In what manner Daksha created living creatures, as commanded
by Brahmá, you shall hear. In the first place he willed into existence
the deities, the Rishis, the quiristers of heaven, the Titans, and the
snake-gods. Finding that his will-born progeny did not multiply
themselves, he determined, in order to secure their increase, to
establish sexual intercourse as the means of multiplication. For this
purpose he espoused Asikní, the daughter of the patriarch Vírańa <span
id="fr_285"></span>[8](#fn_285.md), a damsel addicted to devout practices,
the eminent supportress of the world. By her the great father of mankind
begot five thousand mighty sons, through whom he expected the world
should be peopled. Nárada, the divine Rishi, observing them desirous to
multiply posterity, approached them, and addressed them in a friendly
tone: "Illustrious Haryaswas, it is evident that your intention is to
beget posterity; but first consider this: why should you, who, like
fools, know not the middle, the height, and depth of the world <span
id="fr_286"></span>[9](#fn_286.md), propagate offspring? When your
intellect is no more obstructed by interval, height, or depth, then how,
fools, shall ye not all behold the term of the universe?" Having heard
the words of Nárada, the sons of Daksha dispersed themselves through the
regions, and to the present day have not returned; as rivers that lose
themselves in the ocean come back no more.

The Haryaswas having disappeared, the patriarch Daksha begot by the
daughter of Vírańa a thousand other sons. They, who were named
Savaláswas, were desirous of engendering posterity, but were dissuaded
by Nárada in a similar manner. They said to one another, "What the Muni
has observed is perfectly just. We must follow the path that our

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

brothers have travelled, and when we have ascertained the extent of the
universe, we will multiply our race." Accordingly they scattered
themselves through the regions, and, like rivers flowing into the sea,
they returned not again. Henceforth brother seeking for brother
disappears, through ignorance of the products of the first principle of
things. Daksha the patriarch, on finding that all these his sons had
vanished, was incensed, and denounced an imprecation upon Nárada <span
id="fr_287"></span>[10](#fn_287.md).

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

Then, Maitreya, the wise patriarch, it is handed down to us, being
anxious to people the world, created sixty daughters of the daughter of
Vírańá <span id="fr_288"></span>[11](#fn_288.md); ten of whom he gave to
Dharma, thirteen to Kaśyapa, and twenty-seven to Soma, four to
Arisht́anemi, two to Bahuputra, two to Angiras, and two to Kriśáśwa. I
will tell you their names. Arundhat́í, Vasu, Yámí, Lambá, Bhánú,
Marutwatí, Sankalpa, Muhúrttá, Sádhyá, and Viśwá were the ten wives of
Dharma <span id="fr_289"></span>[12](#fn_289.md), and bore him the
following

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

progeny. The sons of Viśwá were the Viśwádevas <span
id="fr_290"></span>[13](#fn_290.md); and the Sádhyas <span
id="fr_291"></span>[14](#fn_291.md), those of Sádhyá. The Máruts, or winds,
were the children of Marutwatí; the Vasus, of Vasu. The Bhánus (or suns)
of Bhánu; and the deities presiding over moments, of Muhúrttá. Ghosha
was the son of Lambá (an arc of the heavens); Nágavíthí (the milky way),
the daughter of Yámí (night). The divisions of the earth were born of
Arundhat́i; and Sankalpa (pious purpose), the soul of all, was the son of
Sankalpá. The deities called Vasus, because, preceded by fire, they
abound in splendour and might <span id="fr_292"></span>[15](#fn_292.md),
are severally named Ápa, Dhruva, Soma, Dhava (fire), Anila (wind), Anala
(fire), Pratyúsha (day-break), and Prabhása (light). The four sons of
Ápa were Vaitańd́ya, Śrama (weariness), Sránta (fatigue), and Dhur
(burthen). Kála (time), the cherisher of the world, was the son of
Dhruva. The son of Soma was Varchas (light), who was the father of
Varchaswí (radiance). Dhava had, by his wife Manohará (loveliness),
Dravińa, Hutahavyaváha, Śiśira, Práńa, and Ramańa. The two sons of Anila
(wind), by his wife Śivá, were Manojava (swift as thought) and
Avijnátagati (untraceable motion). The son of Agni (fire), Kumára, was
born in a clump of Śara reeds: his sons were Sákha, Visákha, Naigameya,
and Prisht́haja. The offspring of the Krittikás was named Kártikeya. The
son of Pratyúsha was the Rishi named Devala, who had two philosophic and
intelligent sons <span id="fr_293"></span>[16](#fn_293.md). The sister of
Váchaspati, lovely and virtuous, Yogasiddhá, who pervades the wholes
world without

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

being devoted to it, was the wife of Prabhása, the eighth of the Vasus,
and bore to him the patriarch Viswakarmá, the author of a thousand arts,
the mechanist of the gods, the fabricator of all ornaments, the chief of
artists, the constructor of the self-moving chariots of the deities, and
by whose skill men obtain subsistence. Ajaikapád, Ahirvradhna, and the
wise Rudra Twasht́ri, were born; and the self-born son of Twashtri was
also the celebrated Viśwarúpa. There are eleven well-known Rudras, lords
of the three worlds, or Hara, Bahurúpa, Tryambaka, Aparájita,
Vrishakapi, Sambhu, Kaparddí, Raivata, Mrigavyádha, Sarva, and
Kapáli <span id="fr_294"></span>[17](#fn_294.md); but there are a hundred
appellations of the immeasurably mighty Rudras <span
id="fr_295"></span>[18](#fn_295.md).

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

The daughters of Daksha who were married to Kaśyapa were Aditi, Diti,
Danu, Arisht́á, Surasá, Surabhi, Vinatá, Támrá, Krodhavaśá, Id́á, Khasá,
Kadru, and Muni <span id="fr_296"></span>[19](#fn_296.md); whose progeny I
will describe to you. There were twelve celebrated deities in a former
Manwantara, called Tushitas <span id="fr_297"></span>[20](#fn_297.md), who,
upon the approach of the present period, or in the reign of the last
Manu, Chákshusha, assembled, and said to one another, "Come, let us
quickly enter into the womb of Adití, that we may be born in the next
Manwantara, for thereby we shall again enjoy the rank of gods:" and
accordingly they were born the sons of Kaśyapa, the son of Maríchi, by
Adití, the daughter of Daksha; thence named the twelve Ádityas; whose
appellations were respectively, Vishńu, Śakra, Áryaman, Dhútí, Twásht́ri,
Púshan, Vivaswat, Savitri, Mitra, Varuńa, Anśa, and Bhaga <span
id="fr_298"></span>[21](#fn_298.md). These, who in the Chákshusha
Manwantara were the gods called Tushitas, were called the twelve Ádityas
in the Manwantara of Vaivaśwata.

The twenty-seven daughters of the patriarch who became the virtuous
wives of the moon were all known as the nymphs of the lunar
constellations,

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

which were called by their names, and had children who were brilliant
through their great splendour <span id="fr_299"></span>[22](#fn_299.md).
The wives of Arisht́anemi bore him sixteen children <span
id="fr_300"></span>[23](#fn_300.md). The daughters of Bahuputra were the
four lightnings <span id="fr_301"></span>[24](#fn_301.md). The excellent
Pratyangirasa Richas were the children of Angiras <span
id="fr_302"></span>[25](#fn_302.md), descended from the holy sage: and the
deified weapons of the gods <span id="fr_303"></span>[26](#fn_303.md) were
the progeny of Kriśáśwa.

These classes of thirty-three divinities <span
id="fr_304"></span>[27](#fn_304.md) are born again at the end of a thousand
ages, according to their own pleasure; and their appearance and
disappearance is here spoken of as birth and death: but, Maitreya, these
divine personages exist age after age in the same manner as the sun sets
and rises again.

It has been related to us, that Diti had two sons by Kaśyapa, named
Hirańyakaśipu and the invincible Hirańyáksha: she had also a daughter,

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sinká, the wife of
Viprachitti. Hirańyakaśipu was the father of four mighty sons, Anuhláda,
Hláda, the wise Prahláda, and the heroic Sanhláda, the augmentor of the
Daitya race <span id="fr_305"></span>[28](#fn_305.md). Amongst these, the
illustrious Prahláda, looking on all things with indifference, devoted
his whole faith to Janárddana. The flames that were lighted by the king
of the Daityas consumed not him, in whose heart Vásudeva was cherished;
and all the earth trembled when, bound with bonds, he moved amidst the
waters of the ocean. His firm body, fortified by a mind engrossed by
Achyuta, was unwounded by the weapons hurled on him by order of the
Daitya monarch; and the serpents sent to destroy him breathed their
venomous flames upon him in vain. Overwhelmed with rocks, he yet
remained unhurt; for he never forgot Vishńu, and the recollection of the
deity was his armour of proof. Hurled from on high by the king of the
Daityas, residing in Swerga, earth received him unharmed. The wind sent
into his body to wither him up was itself annihilated by him, in whom
Madhusúdana was present. The fierce elephants of the spheres broke their
tusks, and vailed their pride, against the firm breast which the lord of
the Daityas had ordered them to assault. The ministrant priests of the
monarch were baffled in all their rites for the destruction of one so
steadily attached to Govinda: and the thousand delusions of the
fraudulent Samvara, counteracted by the discus of Krishńa, were
practised without success. The deadly poison administered by his
father's officers he partook of unhesitatingly, and without its working
any visible change; for he looked upon the world with mind undisturbed,
and, full of benignity, regarded all things with equal affection, and as
identical with himself. He was righteous; an inexhaustible mine of
purity and truth; and an unfailing model for all pious men.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[112:1](vp050.htm#fr_278.md) Or, 'immersed in the
six Úrmis'; explained hunger, thirst, sorrow, stupefaction, decay, and
death.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[113:2](vp050.htm#fr_279.md) There is some
confusion here in regard to the person addressed, but the context shews
that the insertion of Maitreya's name is an inadvertence, and that the
passage is a continuation of Soma's speech to the Prachetasas.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[113:3](vp050.htm#fr_280.md) The phrase is 'made
up of the farther boundary of Brahma;' implying either 'comprehending
the supreme, or Brahma, and transcendental wisdom, Pára;' or, consisting
of the farthest limits (Pára) or truths of the Vedas or Brahma;' that
is, being the essence of the Vedánta philosophy. The hymn that follows
is in fact a mantra or mystical prayer, commencing with the reiteration
of the word Para and Pára; as, \#\#\#. Para means 'supreme, infinite;
and Pára, 'the farther bank or limit,' the point that is to be attained
by crossing a river or sea, or figuratively the world or existence.
Vishńu, then, is Para, that which nothing surpasses; and Pára, the end
or object of existence: he is Apára pára, the farthest bound of that
which is illimitable, or space and time: he is Param parebhyah, above or
beyond the highest, being beyond or superior to all the elements: he is
Paramártha rúpí, or identical with final truth, or knowledge of soul: he
is Brahma pára, the object or essence of spiritual wisdom. Parapárabhúta
is said to imply the farther limit (Pára) of rudimental matter (Para).
He is Para, or chief Paránam, of those objects which are beyond the
senses: and he is Párapára, or the boundary of boundaries; that is, he
is the comprehensive in-vesture of, and exterior to, those limits by
which soul is confined; he is free from all incumbrance or impediment.
The passage may be interpreted in different ways, according to the
ingenuity with which the riddle is read.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[115:4](vp050.htm#fr_281.md) This part of the
legend is peculiar to our text, and the whole story of Márishá's birth
is nowhere else so fully detailed. The penance of the Prachetasas, and
its consequences, are related in the Agni, Bhágavata, Matsya, Padma,
Váyu, and Bráhma Puráńas, and allusion is briefly made to Márishá's
birth. Her origin from Kańd́u and Pramlochá is narrated in a different
place in the Bráhma Puráńa, where the austerities of Kańd́u, and the
necessity for their interruption, are described. The story, from that
authority, was translated by the late Professor Chezy, and is published
in the first number of the Journal Asiatique.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[115:5](vp050.htm#fr_282.md) The second birth of
Daksha, and his share in the peopling of the earth, is narrated in most
of the Puráńas in a similar manner. It is perhaps the original legend,
for Daksha seems to be an irregular adjunct to the Prajápatis, or
mind-born sons of Brahmá (see [p. 49](vp041.htm#page_49.md). n.
[2](vp041.htm#fn_200).md); and the allegorical nature of his posterity in
that character ([p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54).md) intimates a more recent
origin. Nor does that series of descendants apparently occur in the
Mahábhárata, although the existence of two Dakshas is especially
remarked there (Moksha Dh.). In the Ádi Parva, which seems to be the
freest from subsequent improvements, the Daksha noticed is the son of
the Prachetasas. The incompatibility of the two accounts is reconciled
by referring the two Dakshas to different Manwantaras. The Daksha who
proceeded from Brahmá as a Prajápati being born in the first, or
Swáyambhuva, and the son of the Prachetasas in the Chákshusha
Manwantara. The latter however, as descended from Uttánapáda, should
belong to the first period also. It is evident that great confusion has
been made by the Puráńas in Daksha's history.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[115:6](vp050.htm#fr_283.md) That is, they are the
Nakshatras, or lunar asterisms.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[116:7](vp050.htm#fr_284.md) 'They are removed',
which the commentator explains by 'are absorbed, as if they were fast
asleep;' but in every age or Yuga, according to the text--in every
Manwantara, according to the comment--the Rishis reappear, the
circumstances of their origin only being varied. Daksha therefore, as
remarked in the preceding note, is the son of Brahmá in one period, the
son of the Prachetasas in another. So Soma, in the Swáyambhuva
Manwantara, was born as the son of Atri; in the Chákshusha, he was
produced by churning the ocean. The words of our text occur in the Hari
Vanśa, with an unimportant variation: 'Birth and obstruction are
constant in all beings, but Rishis and those men who are wise are not
perplexed by this;' that is, not, as rendered above, by the alternation
of life and death; but, according to the commentator on the Hari Vanśa,
by a very different matter, the prohibition of unlawful marriages.
Utpatti, 'birth of progeny,' is the result of their will; Nirodha,
'obstruction,' is the law prohibiting the intermarriage of persons
connected by the offering of the funeral cake; to which Rishis and sages
are not subject, either from their matrimonial unions being merely
platonic, or from the bad example set by Brahmá, who, according to the
Vedas, approached his own daughter; we have already had occasion to
advert to ([p. 51](vp041.htm#page_51). n. [5](vp041.htm#fn_203).md). The
explanation of the text, however, given by the commentator appears
forced, and less natural than the interpretation preferred above.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[117:8](vp050.htm#fr_285.md) This is the usual
account of Daksha's marriage, and is that of the Mahábhárata, Adi P. (p.
113), and of the Bráhma Puráńa, which the Hari Vanśa, in the first part,
repeats. In another portion, the Pushkara Máhátmya, however, Daksha, it
is said, converts half himself into a female, by whom he begets the
daughters presently to be noticed: \#\#\#. This seems to be merely a new
edition of an old story.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[117:9](vp050.htm#fr_286.md) The commentator
explains it to mean the origin, duration, and termination of subtile
rudimental body; but the Padma and Linga P. distinctly express it, 'the
extent of the earth.'

<span id="fn_287"></span>[118:10](vp050.htm#fr_287.md) Nárada's
interference, and the fruitless generation of the first progeny of
Daksha, is an old legend. The Mahábhárata (Ádi P. p. 113) notices only
one set of sons, who, it is said, obtained Moksha, or liberation,
through Náreda's teaching them the Sánkhya philosophy. The Bráhma,
Matsya, Váyu, Linga, Padma, Agni, and Bhágavata Puráńas tell the story
much as in the text, and not unfrequently in the same words. In general
they merely refer to the imprecation denounced upon Nárada, as above.
The Bhágavata specifies the imprecation to be perpetual peripateticism.
Daksha says to him, 'There shall not be a resting-place for thee in all
these regions.' The Kúrma repeats the imprecation merely to the effect
that Nárada shall perish, and gives no legend. In the Brahma Vaivartta,
Nárada is cursed by Brahmá, on a similar occasion, to become the chief
of the Gandharbas, whence his musical propensities: but the Bhágavata,
VI. 7, has the reverse of this legend, and makes him first a Gandharba,
then a Śúdra, then the son of Brahmá. The Bráhma P., and after it the
Hari Vanśa and the Váyu P., have a different and not very intelligible
story. Daksha, being about to pronounce an imprecation upon Nárada, was
appeased by Brahmá and the Rishis, and it was agreed between them that
Nárada should be again born, as the son of Kaśyapa, by one of Daksha's
daughters. This seems to be the gist of the legend, but it is very
confusedly told. The version of the Bráhma P., which is the same as that
of Hari Vanśa, may be thus rendered: "The smooth-speaking Nárada
addressed the sons of Daksha for their destruction and his own; for the
Muni Kaśyapa begot him as a son, who was the son of Brahmá, on the
daughter of Daksha, through fear of the latter's imprecation. He was
formerly the son of Paramesht́hí (Brahmá), and the excellent sage Kaśyapa
next begot him, as if he were his father, on Asikní, the daughter of
Vírańa. Whilst he was engaged in beguiling the sons of the patriarch,
Daksha, of resistless power, determined on his destruction; but he was
solicited by Brahmá, in the presence of the great sages, and it was
agreed between them that Nárada, the son of Brahmá, should be born of a
daughter of Daksha. Consequently Daksha gave his daughter to
Paramesht́hí, and by her was Nárada born." Now several difficulties occur
here. Asikní is the wife, not the daughter, of Daksha; but this may be a
blunder of the compiler, for in the parallel passage of the Váyu no name
occurs. In the next place, who is this daughter? for, as we shall see,
the progeny of all Daksha's daughters are fully detailed, and in no
<span id="page_119">p. 119</span> authority consulted is Nárada
mentioned as the son of either of them, or as the son of Kaśyapa.
Daksha, too, gives his daughter, not to Kaśyapa, but to Paramesht́hí, or
Brahmá. The commentator on the Hari Vanśa solves this by saying he gives
her to Brahmá for Kaśyapa. The same bargain is noticed in the Váyu, but
Nárada is also said there to be adopted by Kaśyapa. Again, however, it
gives Daksha's imprecation in the same words as the Hari Vanśa; a
passage, by the way, omitted in the Bráhma: 'Nárada, perish (in your
present form), and take up your abode in the womb.' Whatever may be the
original of this legend, it is evidently imperfectly given by the
authorities here cited. The French translation of the passage in the
Hari Vanśa can scarcely be admitted as correct: assuredly is not 'le
Devarchi Dakcha, epoux d'’Asikní, fille de Virána, fut l’aïeul de cet
illustri mouni ainsi régénéré.' \#\#\# is more consistently said by the
commentator to mean Kaśyapa. The Váyu P. in another part, a description
of the different orders of Rishis, states that the Devarshis Parvata and
Náreda were sons of Kaśyapa: In the account of Kárttavírya, in the
Bráhma P. and Hari Vanśa, Nárada is introduced as a Gandharba, the son
of Varidása; being the same, according to the commentator on the latter,
as the Gandharba elsewhere called Upavarhana.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[119:11](vp050.htm#fr_288.md) The prior
specification (p. 115) was fifty. The Mahábhárata, Adi P. 113, and,
again, Moksha Dharma, has the same number. The Bhágavata, Kúrma, Padma,
Linga, and Váyu P. state sixty. The former is perhaps the original, as
the fullest and most consistent details relate to them and their
posterity.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[119:12](vp050.htm#fr_289.md) This is the usual
list of Dharma's wives. The Bhágavata substitutes Kakud for Arundhat́í.
The Padma P., Matsya P., and Hari Vanśa contain two different account of
Daksha's descendants: the first agrees with our text; the second, which
is supposed to occur in the Padma Kalpa, is somewhat varied,
particularly as to the wives of Dharma, who are said to be five. The
nomenclature varies, or,

<div align="center">

| Sávitrí        | Marutwatí         | Urjjaswatí.   |

</div>

There is evident inaccuracy in all the copies, and the names may in some
instances be erroneous. From the succeeding enumeration of their
descendants, it appears that Káma was the son of Lakshmí; the <span
id="page_120">p. 120</span> Sádhyas, of Sádhyá; the Viśwádevas, of
Viśwá; the Máruts, of Marutwatí; and the Vasus, of Deví, who may be
either the Saraswatí or Sávitrí of the previous enumeration.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[120:13](vp050.htm#fr_290.md) The Viśwádevas are a
class of gods to whom sacrifices should be offered daily. Manu, III.
121. They are named in some of the Puráńas, as the Váyu and Matsya: the
former specifying ten; the latter, twelve.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[120:14](vp050.htm#fr_291.md) The Sádhyas,
according to the Váyu, are the personified rites and prayers of the
Vedas, born of the metres, and partakers of the sacrifices. The same
work names twelve, which are all names of sacrifices and formulæ, as
Darśa, Paurnamása, Vrihadaśwa, Rathantara, &c. The Matsya P., Padma P.,
and Hari V. have a different set of seventeen appellations, apparently
of arbitrary selection, as Bhava, Prabhava, Íśa, Aruńi, &c.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[120:15](vp050.htm#fr_292.md) Or, according to the
Padma P., because they are always present in light, or luminous
irradiation.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[120:16](vp050.htm#fr_293.md) The Váyu supplies
their names, Kshamávartta (patient) and Manaswin (wise).

<span id="fn_294"></span>[121:17](vp050.htm#fr_294.md) The passage is,
\#\#\# Whose sons they are does not appear; the object being, according
to the comment, to specify only the eleven divisions or modifications of
the youngest Rudra, Twasht́a.' We have, however, an unusual variety of
reading here in two copies of the comment: 'The eleven Rudras, in whom
the family of Twasht́ri (a synonyme, it may be observed, sometimes of
Viswakarmá) is included, were born. The enumeration of the Rudras ends
with Aparájita, of whom Tryambaka is the epithet.' Accordingly the three
last names in all the other copies of the text are omitted in these two;
their places being supplied by the three first, two of whom are always
named in the lists of the Rudras. According to the Váyu and Bráhma P.
the Rudras are the children of Kaśyapa by Surabhi: the Bhágavata makes
them the progeny of Bhúta and Sarúpá: the Matsya, Padma, and Hari V., in
the second series, the offspring of Surabhi by Brahmá. The names in
three of the Pauráńic authorities run thus:

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Bráhma or Hari
V., the Padma, the Linga, &c. have other varieties; and the Lexicons
have a different reading from all, as in that of Jat́ádhara they are
Ajaikapad, Ahivradhna, Virúpaksha, Sureśwara, Jayanta, Bahurúpaka,
Tryambaka, Aparájita, Vaivaśwata, Śávitra, and Hara. The variety seems
to proceed from the writers applying to the Rudras, as they may
legitimately do, different appellations of the common prototype, or
synonymes of Rudra or Śiva, selected at will from his thousand and eight
names, according to the Linga P.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[121:18](vp050.htm#fr_295.md) The posterity of
Daksha's daughters <span id="page_122">p. 122</span> by Dharma are
clearly allegorical personifications chiefly of two classes, one
consisting of astronomical phenomena, and the other of portions or
subjects of the ritual of the Vedas.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[122:19](vp050.htm#fr_296.md) There is some,
though not much, variation in these names in different Puráńas. The
Bhágavata has Saramá, Kasht́ha, and Timi, the parents severally of canine
animals, beasts with uncloven hoofs, and fishes, in place of Vinatá,
Khasá, and Kadru; disposing of the first and last differently. The Váyu
has Pravá in place of Arisht́á, and Anáyush or Danáyush for Surasá. The
Padma P., second series, substitutes Kálá, Anáyush, Sinhiká, Piśáchá,
Vách for Arisht́a, Surasá, Surabhi, Támrá, and Muni; and omits Id́á and
Khasá. In the Uttara Khańd́a of the same, Kaśyapa's wives are said to be
but four, Aditi, Diti, Kadru, and Vinatá.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[122:20](vp050.htm#fr_297.md) In the sixth reign,
or that of Chákshusha Manu, according to the text; but in book III. ch.
1. the Tushitas are the gods of the second or Swárochisha Manwantara.
The Váyu has a much more complete legend than any other Pura on this
subject. In the beginning of the Kalpa twelve gods, named Jayas, were
created by Brahmá, as his deputies and assistants in the creation. They,
lost in meditation, neglected his commands; on which he cursed them to
be repeatedly born in each Manwantara till the seventh. They were
accordingly, in the several successive Manwantaras, Ajitas, Tushitas,
Satyas, Haris, Vaikunthas, Sádhyas, and Ádityas. Our authority and some
others, as the Bráhma, have apparently intended to refer to this
account, but have confused the order of the series.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[122:21](vp050.htm#fr_298.md) <span
id="page_123">p. 123</span> The Puráńas that contain this genealogy
agree tolerably well in these names. The Bhágavata adds many details
regarding some of the Ádityas and their descendants.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[123:22](vp050.htm#fr_299.md) The Nakshatra
Yoginis, or chief stars of the lunar mansions, or asterisms in the
moon's path.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[123:23](vp050.htm#fr_300.md) None of the
authorities are more specific on the subject of Arisht́anemis' progeny.
In the Mahábhárata this is said to be another name of Kaśyapa. The
Bhágavata substitutes Tárksha for this personage, said by the
commentator to be likewise another name of Kaśyapa. His wives are,
Kadru, Vinatá, Patangi, and Yáminí, mothers of snakes, birds,
grasshoppers, and locusts.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[123:24](vp050.htm#fr_301.md) Enumerated in
astrological works as brown, red, yellow, and white; portending
severally wind, heat, rain, famine.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[123:25](vp050.htm#fr_302.md) The Richas, or
verses, thirty-five in number, addressed to presiding divinities,
denominated Pratyangirasas. The Bhágavata calls the wives of Anginas,
Swadhá and Satí, and makes them the mothers of the Pitris and the
Atharvan Veda severally.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[123:26](vp050.htm#fr_303.md) The Śastra devatas,
'gods of the divine weapons;' a hundred are enumerated in the Rámáyańa,
and they are there termed the sons of Kriśáśwa by Jayá and Vijayá,
daughters of the Prajápati; that is, of Daksha. The Bhágavata terms the
two wives of Kriśáśwa, Archish (flame) and Dhishańá; the former is the
mother of Dhúmaketu (comet); the latter, of four sages, Devala,
Vedaśiras, Vayuńa, and Manu. The allegorical origin of the weapons is
undoubtedly the more ancient.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[123:27](vp050.htm#fr_304.md) This number is
founded upon a text of the Vedas, which to the eight Vasus, eleven
Rudras, and twelve Ádityas, adds Prajápati, either Brahmá or Daksha, and
Vashatkára, 'deified oblation.' They have the epithet Chhandajá, as born
in different Manwantaras, of their own will.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[124:28](vp050.htm#fr_305.md) The Puráńas
generally concur in this genealogy, reading sometimes Anuhráda, Hráda,
&c. for Anuhláda and the rest. Although placed second in the order of
Kaśyapa's descendants, the Daityas are in fact the elder branch. Thus
the Mahábhárata, Moksha Dherma, calls Diti the senior wife of Kaśyapa:
and the Váyu terms Hirańyakaśipu and Hirańyáksha the eldest of all the
sons of that patriarch. "Titan and his enormous brood" were "heaven's
first born."
