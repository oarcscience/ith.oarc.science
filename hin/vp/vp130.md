### CHAP. XIII.

Krishńa praised by the cowherds: his sports with the Gopís: their
imitation and love of hire. The Rása dance.

AFTER Śakra had departed, the cowherds said to Krishńa, whom they had
seen holding up Govarddhana, "We have been preserved, together with our
cattle, from a great peril, by your supporting the mountain above us;
but this is very astonishing child's play, unsuitable to the condition
of a herdsman, and all thy actions are those of a god. Tell us what is
the meaning of all this. Kálíya has been conquered in the lake; Pralamba
has been killed; Govarddhana has been lifted up: our minds are filled
with amazement. Assuredly we repose at the feet of Hari, O thou of
unbounded might! for, having witnessed thy power, we cannot believe thee
to be a man. Thy affection, Keśava, for our women and children, and for
Vraja; the deeds that thou hast wrought, which all the gods would have
attempted in vain; thy boyhood, and thy prowess; thy humiliating birth
amongst us; are contradictions that fill us with doubt, whenever we
think of them. Yet reverence be to thee, whether thou be a god, or a
demon, or a Yaksha, or a Gandharba, or whatever we may deem thee; for
thou art our friend." When they had ended, Krishńa remained silent for
some time, as if hurt and offended, and then replied to them, "Herdsmen,
if you are not ashamed of my relationship; if I have merited your
praise; what occasion is there for you to engage in any discussion
concerning me? If you have any regard for me; if I have deserved your
praise; then be satisfied to know that I am your kinsman. I am neither
god, nor Yaksha, nor Gandharba, nor Dánava; I have been born your
relative, and you must not think differently of me." Upon receiving this
answer, the Gopas held their peace, and went into the woods, leaving
Krishńa apparently displeased.

But Krishńa, observing the clear sky bright with the autumnal moon, and
the air perfumed with the fragrance of the wild water-lily, in whose
buds the clustering bees were murmuring their songs, felt inclined to
join with the Gopís in sport. Accordingly he and Ráma commenced

<span id="page_532">p. 532</span>

singing sweet low strains in various measures, such as the women loved;
and they, as soon as they heard the melody, quitted their homes, and
hastened to meet the foe of Madhu. One damsel gently sang an
accompaniment to his song; another attentively listened to his melody:
one calling out upon his name, then shrunk abashed; whilst another, more
bold, and instigated by affection, pressed close to his side: one, as
she sallied forth, beheld some of the seniors of the family, and dared
not venture, contenting herself with meditating on Krishńa with closed
eyes, and entire devotion, by which immediately all acts of merit were
effaced by rapture, and all sin was expiated by regret at not beholding
him: and others, again, reflecting upon the cause of the world, in the
form of the supreme Brahma, obtained by their sighing final
emancipation. Thus surrounded by the Gopís, Krishńa thought the lovely
moonlight night of autumn propitious to the Rasa dance <span
id="fr_1493"></span>[1](#fn_1493.md). Many of the Gopís imitated the
different actions of Krishńa, and in his absence wandered through
Vrindavan, representing his person. "I am Krishńa," cries one; "behold
the elegance of my movements." "I am Krishńa," exclaims another; "listen
to my song." "Vile Kálíya, stay! for I am Krishńa," is repeated by a
third, slapping her arms in defiance. A fourth calls out, "Herdsmen,
fear nothing; be steady; the danger of the storm is over, for, lo, I
lift up Govarddhana for your shelter." And a fifth proclaims, "Now let
the herds graze where they will, for I have destroyed Dhenuka." Thus in
various actions of Krishńa the Gopís imitated him, whilst away, and
beguiled their sorrow by mimicking his sports. Looking down upon the
ground, one damsel calls to her friend, as the light down upon her body
stands erect with joy, and the lotuses of her eyes expand, "See here are
the marks of Krishńa's feet, as he has gone alone sportively, and left
the impressions of the banner, fife thunderbolt, and the goad <span
id="fr_1494"></span>[2](#fn_1494.md). What lovely maiden has been his
companion, inebriate with

<span id="page_533">p. 533</span>

passion, as her irregular footmarks testify? Here Dámodara has gathered
flowers from on high, for we see alone the impressions of the tips of
his feet. Here a nymph has sat down with him, ornamented with flowers,
fortunate in having propitiated Vishńu in a prior existence. Having left
her in an arrogant mood, because he had offered her flowers, the son of
Nanda has gone by this road; for see, unable to follow him with equal
steps, his associate has here tripped along upon her toes, and, holding
his hand, the damsel has passed, as is evident from the uneven and
intermingled footsteps. But the rogue has merely taken her hand, and
left her neglected, for here the paces indicate the path of a person in
despair. Undoubtedly he promised that he would quickly come again, for
here are his own footsteps returning with speed. Here he has entered the
thick forest, impervious to the rays of the moon, and his steps can be
traced no farther." Hopeless then of beholding Krishńa, the Gopís
returned, and repaired to the banks of the Yamuná, where they sang his
songs; and presently they beheld the preserver of the three worlds, with
a smiling aspect, hastening towards them: on which, one exclaimed,
"Krishńa! Krishńa!" unable to articulate any thing else: another
affected to contract her forehead with frowns, as drinking with the bees
of her eyes the lotus of the face of Hari: another, closing her eyelids,
contemplated internally his form, as if engaged in an act of devotion.
Then Mádhava, coming amongst them, conciliated some with soft speeches,
some with gentle looks, and some he took by the hand; and the
illustrious deity sported with them in the stations of the dance. As
each of the Gopís, however, attempted to keep in one place, close to the
side of Krishńa, the circle of the dance could not be constructed, and
he therefore took each by the hand, and when their eyelids were shut by
the effects of such touch, the circle was formed <span
id="fr_1495"></span>[3](#fn_1495.md). Then proceeded the dance

<span id="page_534">p. 534</span>

to the music of their clashing bracelets, and songs that celebrated in
suitable strain the charms of the autumnal season. Krishńa sang the

<span id="page_535">p. 535</span>

moon of autumn, a mine of gentle radiance; but the nymphs repeated the
praises of Krishńa alone. At times, one of them, wearied by the
revolving dance, threw her arms, ornamented with tinkling bracelets,
round the neck of the destroyer of Madhu: another, skilled in the art of
singing his praises, embraced him. The drops of perspiration from the
arms of Hari were like fertilizing rain, which produced a crop of down
upon the temples of the Gopís. Krishńa sang the strain that was
appropriate to the dance. The Gopís repeatedly exclaimed, "Bravo,
Krishńa!" to his song. When leading, they followed him; when returning,
they encountered him; and, whether he went forwards or backwards, they
ever attended on his steps. Whilst frolicking thus with the Gopís, they
considered every instant without him a myriad of years; and, prohibited
in vain by husbands, fathers, brothers, they went forth at night to
sport with Krishńa, the object of their affection. Thus the illimitable
being, the benevolent remover of all imperfections, assumed the
character of a youth amongst the females of the herdsmen of Vraja;
pervading their natures, and that of their lords, by his own essence,
all diffusive like the wind: for even as in all creatures the elements
of ether, fire, earth, water, and air, are comprehended, so also is he
every where present, and in all.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1493"></span>[532:1](vp130.htm#fr_1493.md) The Rása dance is
danced by men and women, holding each other's hands, and going round in
a circle, singing the airs to which they dance. According to Bharata,
the airs are various both in melody and time, and the number of persons
should not exceed sixty-four.

<span id="fn_1494"></span>[532:2](vp130.htm#fr_1494.md) The soles of the
feet of a deity are <span id="page_533">p. 533</span> usually marked by
a variety of emblematical figures: this is carried to the greatest
extravagance by the Buddhists, the marks on the feet of Gautama being
130: see Trans. R. As. Soc. III. 70. It is a decoration very moderately
employed by the Hindus.

<span id="fn_1495"></span>[533:3](vp130.htm#fr_1495.md) This is a rather
inexplicit statement, but the comment makes it clear. Krishńa, it is
said, in order to form the circle, takes each damsel by the hand, and
leads her to her place: there he quits her; but the effect of the
contact is such, that it deprives her of the power of perception, and
<span id="page_534">p. 534</span> she contentedly takes the hand of her
female neighbour, thinking it to be Krishńa's. The Bhágavata is bolder,
and asserts that Krishńa multiplied himself, and actually stood between
each two damsels: 'The Rása dance, formed of a circle graced by the
Gopís, was then led off by the lord of magic, Krishńa having placed
himself in the midst of every two of the nymphs.' The Hari Vanśa
intimates the same, though not very fully: 'Then all the nymphs of the
cowherds, placing themselves in couples in a row, engaged in pleasant
diversion, singing the deeds of Krishńa.' The Pankti, or row, is said by
the commentator to mean here, the Mańd́ala, or ring; and the couples' to
imply that Krishńa was between every two. He quotes a verse to this
effect from some other Vaishńava work: 'Between each two damsels was
Mádhava, and between each two Mádhavas was a nymph; and the son of
Devakí played on the flute:' for, in fact, Krishńa is not only dancing
with each, but also by himself in the centre; for this the commentator
on the Hari Vanśa cites a passage from the Vedas: \#\#\#. Literally,
'The many-formed (being) assumes (various) bodies. One form stood apart,
occupying triple observance.' Now if the verse be genuine, it probably
refers to something that has little to do with Krishńa; but it is
explained to apply to the Rása; the form of Krishńa being supposed to be
meant, as wholly distinct from the Gopís, and yet being beheld by every
one of them, on each side and in front of her. In the meditation upon
Krishńa, which is enjoined in the Brahma Vaivartta, he is to be
contemplated in the centre of the Rása Mańd́ala, in association with his
favourite Rádhá; but the Mańd́ala described in that work is not a ring of
dancers, but a circle of definite space at Vrindávana, within which
Krishńa, Rádhá, and the Gopís divert themselves, not very decorously.
This work has probably given the tone to the style in which the annual
festival, the Rása Yátrá, is celebrated in various parts of India, in
the month of Kártika, upon the sun's entrance into Libra, by nocturnal
dances, and representations of the sports of Krishńa. A circular dance
of men and women, however, does not form any prominent feature at these
entertainments, and it may be doubted if it is ever performed. Some of
the earliest labourers in the field of Hindu mythology have thought this
circular dance to typify the dance of the planets round the sun
(Maurice, Ancient History of Hindus, I. 108. II. 356); but there is no
particular number assigned to the performers by any of the Hindu
authorities, beyond its limitation to sixty-four. At the Rása Mandala of
the Brahma Vaivartta, Rádhá is accompanied by thirty-six of her most
particular friends amongst the Gopís, but they are each attended by
thousands of inferior personages, and none <span id="page_535">p.
535</span> of the crowd are left without male multiples of Krishńa. The
only mysticism hinted at in that Puráńa, is, that these are all one with
Krishńa: the varied vital conditions of one spirit being represented by
the Gopís and the illusory manifestations of Krishńa: he himself being
supreme unmodified soul.
