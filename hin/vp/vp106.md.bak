### CHAP. XIII.

Sons of Satwata. Bhoja princes of Mrittikávatí. Súrya the friend of
Satrájit: appears to him in a bodily form: gives him the Syamantaka gem:
its brilliance and marvellous properties. Satrájit gives it to Prasena,
who is killed by a lion: the lion killed by the bear Jámbavat. Krishńa
suspected of killing Prasena, goes to look for him in the forests:
traces the bear to his cave: fights with him for the jewel: the contest
prolonged: supposed by his companions to be slain: he overthrows
Jámbavat, and marries his daughter Jámbavatí: returns with her and the
jewel to Dwáraká: restores the jewel to Satrájit, and marries his
daughter Satyabhámá. Satrájit murdered by Śatadhanwan: avenged by
Krishńa. Quarrel between Krishńa and Balaráma. Akrúra possessed of the
jewel: leaves Dwáraká. Public calamities. Meeting of the Yádavas. Story
of Akrúra's birth: he is invited to return: accused by Krishńa of having
the Syamantaka jewel: produces it in full assembly: it remains in his
charge: Krishńa acquitted of having purloined it.

THE sons of Satwata were Bhajina, Bhajamána, Divya, Andhaka,
Devávriddha, Mahábhoja, and Vrishńi <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[1](#fn_1145.md). Bhajamána had three sons, Nimi <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[2](#fn_1146.md), Krikańa <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[3](#fn_1147.md), and Vrishńi <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[4](#fn_1148.md), by one wife, and as many by another,
Śatajit, Sahasrajit, and Ayutajit <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[5](#fn_1149.md). The son of Devávriddha was Babhru of
whom this verse is recited; "We hear when afar, and we behold when nigh,
that Babhru is the first of men, and Devávriddha is equal to the gods:
sixty-six persons following the precepts of one, and six thousand and
eight who were disciples of the other, obtained immortality." Mahábhoja
was a pious prince; his descendants were the Bhojas, the princes of
Mrittikávatí <span id="fr_1150"></span>[6](#fn_1150.md), thence called
Márttikávatas <span id="fr_1151"></span>[7](#fn_1151.md). Vrishńi had two
sons, Sumitra and Yudhájit <span id="fr_1152"></span>[8](#fn_1152.md); from
the former Anamitra and Śini were

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

born <span id="fr_1153"></span>[9](#fn_1153.md). The son of Anamitra was
Nighna, who had two sons, Prasena and Satrájit. The divine Áditya, the
sun, was the friend of the latter.

On one occasion Satrájit, whilst walking along the sea shore, addressed
his mind to Súrya, and hymned his praises; on which the divinity
appeared and stood before him. Beholding him in an indistinct shape,
Satrájit said to the sun, "I have beheld thee, lord, in the heavens as a
globe of fire: now do thou shew favour unto me, that I may see thee in
thy proper form." On this the sun taking the jewel called Syamantaka
from off his neck, placed it apart, and Satrájit beheld him of a
dwarfish stature, with a body like burnished copper, and with slightly
reddish eyes. Having offered his adorations, the sun desired him to
demand a boon, and he requested that the jewel might become his. The sun
presented it to him, and then resumed his place in the sky. Having
obtained the spotless gem of gems, Satrájit wore it on his neck, and
becoming as brilliant thereby as the sun himself, irradiating all the
region with his splendour, he returned to Dwáraká. The inhabitants of
that city, beholding him approach, repaired to the eternal male,
Purushottama, who, to sustain the burden of the earth, had assumed a
mortal form (as Krishńa), and said to him, "Lord, assuredly the divine
sun is coming to visit you." But Krishńa smiled, and said, "It is not
the divine sun, but Satrájit, to whom Áditya has presented the
Syamantaka gem, and he now wears it: go and behold him without
apprehension." Accordingly they departed. Satrájit having gone to his
house, there deposited the jewel, which yielded daily eight loads of
gold, and through its marvellous virtue dispelled all fear of portents,
wild beasts, fire, robbers, and famine.

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

Achyuta was of opinion that this wonderful gem should be in the
possession of Ugrasena; but although he had the power of taking it from
Satrájit, he did not deprive him of it, that he might not occasion ally
disagreement amongst the family. Satrájit, on the other hand, fearing
that Krishńa would ask him for the jewel, transferred it to his brother
Prasena. Now it was the peculiar property of this jewel, that although
it was an inexhaustible source of good to a virtuous person, yet when
worn by a man of bad character it was the cause of his death. Prasena
having taken the gem, and hung it round his neck, mounted his horse, and
went to the woods to hunt. In the chase he was killed by a lion. The
lion, taking the jewel in his mouth, was about to depart, when he was
observed and killed by Jámbavat, the king of the bears, who carrying off
the gem retired into his cave, and gave it to his son Sukumára to play
with. When some time had elapsed, and Prasena did not appear, the
Yádavas began to whisper one to another, and to say, "This is Krishńa's
doing: desirous of the jewel, and not obtaining it, he has perpetrated
the murder of Prasena in order to get it into his possession."

When these calumnious rumours came to the knowledge of Krishńa, he
collected a number of the Yádavas, and accompanied by them pursued the
course of Prasena by the impressions of his horse's hoofs. Ascertaining
by this means that he and his horse had been killed by a lion, he was
acquitted by all the people of any share in his death. Desirous of
recovering the gem, he thence followed the steps of the lion, and at no
great distance came to the place where the lion had been killed by the
bear. Following the footmarks of the latter, he arrived at the foot of a
mountain, where he desired the Yádavas to await him, whilst he continued
the track. Still guided by the marks of the feet, he discovered a
cavern, and had scarcely entered it when he heard the nurse of Sukumára
saying to him, "The lion killed Prasena; the lion has been killed by
Jámbavat: weep not, Sukumára, the Syamantaka is your own." Thus assured
of his object, Krishńa advanced into the cavern, and saw the brilliant
jewel in the hands of the nurse, who was giving it as a plaything to
Sukumára. The nurse soon descried his

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

approach, and marking his eyes fixed upon the gem with eager desire,
called loudly for help. Hearing her cries, Jámbavat, full of anger, came
to the cave, and a conflict ensued between him and Achyuta, which lasted
twenty-one days. The Yádavas who had accompanied the latter waited seven
or eight days in expectation of his return, but as the foe of Madhu
still came not forth, they concluded that he must have met his death in
the cavern. "It could not have required so many days," they thought, "to
overcome an enemy;" and accordingly they departed, and returned to
Dwáraká, and announced that Krishńa had been killed.

When the relations of Achyuta heard this intelligence, they performed
all the obsequial rites suited to the occasion. The food and water thus
offered to Krishńa in the celebration of his Śráddha served to support
his life, and invigorate his strength in the combat in which he was
engaged; whilst his adversary, wearied by daily conflict with a powerful
foe, bruised and battered in every limb by heavy blows, and enfeebled by
want of food, became unable longer to resist him. Overcome by his mighty
antagonist, Jámbavat cast himself before him and said, "Thou, mighty
being, art surely invincible by all the demons, and by the spirits of
heaven, earth, or hell; much less art thou to be vanquished by mean and
powerless creatures in a human shape; and still less by such as we are,
who are born of brute origin. Undoubtedly thou art a portion of my
sovereign lord Náráyańa, the defender of the universe." Thus addressed
by Jámbavat, Krishńa explained to him fully that he had descended to
take upon himself the burden of the earth, and kindly alleviated the
bodily pain which the bear suffered from the fight, by touching him with
his hand. Jámbavat again prostrated himself before Krishńa, and
presented to him his daughter Jámbavatí, as an offering suitable to a
guest. He also delivered to his visitor the Syamantaka jewel. Although a
gift from such an individual was not fit for his acceptance, yet Krishńa
took the gem for the purpose of clearing his reputation. He then
returned along with his bride Jámbavatí to Dwáraká..

When the people of Dwáraká beheld Krishńa alive and returned, they were
filled with delight, so that those who were bowed down with

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

years recovered youthful vigour; and all the Yádavas, men and women,
assembled round Ánakadundubhi, the father of the hero, and congratulated
him. Krishńa related to the whole assembly of the Yádavas all that had
happened, exactly as it had befallen, and restoring the Syamantaka jewel
to Satrájit was exonerated from the crime of which he had been falsely
accused. He then led Jámbavatí into the inner apartments.

When Satrájit reflected that he had been the cause of the aspersions
upon Krishńa's character, he felt alarmed, and to conciliate the prince
he gave him to wife his daughter Satyabhámá. The maiden had been
previously sought in marriage by several of the most distinguished
Yádavas, as Akrúra, Kritavarman and Śatadhanwan, who were highly
incensed at her being wedded to another, and leagued in enmity against
Satrájit. The chief amongst them, with Akrúra and Kritavarman, said to
Śatadhanwan, "This caitiff Satrájit has offered a gross insult to you,
as well as to us who solicited his daughter, by giving her to Krishńa:
let him not live: why do you not kill him, and take the jewel? Should
Achyuta therefore enter into feud with you, we will take your part."
Upon this promise Śatadhanwan undertook to slay Satrájit.

When news arrived that the sons of Páńd́u had been burned in
[the](errata.htm#20.md) house of wax <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[10](#fn_1154.md), Krishńa, who knew the real truth,
set off for Bárańávata to allay the animosity of Duryodhana, and to
perform the duties his relationship required. Śatadhanwan taking
advantage of his absence, killed Satrájit in his sleep, and took
possession of the gem. Upon this coming to the knowledge of Satyabhámá,
she immediately mounted her chariot, and, filled with fury at her
father's murder, repaired to Bárańávata, and told her husband how
Satrájit had been killed by Śatadhanwan in resentment of her having been
married to another, and how he had carried off the jewel; and she
implored him to take prompt measures to avenge such heinous wrong.
Krishńa, who is ever internally placid, being informed of these
transactions, said to Satyabhámá, as his eyes flashed with indignation,
"These are indeed

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

audacious injuries, but I will not submit to them from so vile a wretch.
They must assail the tree, who would kill the birds that there have
built their nests. Dismiss excessive sorrow; it needs not your
lamentations to excite any wrath." Returning forthwith to Dwáraká,
Krishńa took Baladeva apart, and said to him, "A lion slew Prasena,
hunting in the forests; and now Satrájit has been murdered by
Śatadhanwan. As both these are removed, the jewel which belonged to them
is our common right. Up then, ascend your car, and put Śatadhanwan to
death."

Being thus excited by his brother, Balaráma engaged resolutely in the
enterprise; but Śatadhanwan, being aware of their hostile designs,
repaired to Kritavarman, and required his assistance. Kritavarman,
however, declined to assist him, pleading his inability to engage in a
conflict with both Baladeva and Krishńa. Śatadhanwan thus disappointed,
applied to Akrúra; but he said, "You must have recourse to some other
protector. How should I be able to defend you? There is no one even
amongst the immortals, whose praises are celebrated throughout the
universe, who is capable of contending with the wielder of the discus,
at the stamp of whose foot the three worlds tremble; whose hand makes
the wives of the Asuras widows, whose weapons no host, however mighty,
can resist: no one is capable of encountering the wielder of the
ploughshare, who annihilates the prowess of his enemies by the glances
of his eyes, that roll with the joys of wine; and whose vast ploughshare
manifests his might, by seizing and exterminating the most formidable
foes." "Since this is the case," replied Śatadhanwan, "and you are
unable to assist me, at least accept and take care of this jewel." "I
will do so," answered Akrúra, "if you promise that even in the last
extremity you will not divulge its being in my possession." To this
Śatadhanwan agreed, and Akrúra took the jewel; and the former mounting a
very swift mare, one that could travel a hundred leagues a day, fled
from Dwáraká.

When Krishńa heard of Śatadhanwan's flight, he harnessed his four
horses, Śaivya, Sugríva, Meghapushpa, and Baláhaka, to his car, and,
accompanied by Balaráma, set off in pursuit. The mare held her speed,

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

and accomplished her hundred leagues; but when she reached the country
of Mithilá, her strength was exhausted, and she dropped down and died.
Śatadhanwan <span id="fr_1155"></span>[11](#fn_1155.md) dismounting,
continued his flight on foot. When his pursuers came to the place where
the mare had perished, Krishńa said to Balaráma, "Do you remain in the
car, whilst I follow the villain on foot, and put him to death; the
ground here is bad; and the horses will not be able to drag the chariot
across it." Balaráma accordingly stayed with the car, and Krishńa
followed Śatadhanwan on foot: when he had chased him for two kos, he
discharged his discus, and, although Śatadhanwan was at a considerable
distance, the weapon struck off his head. Krishńa then coining up,
searched his body and his dress for the Syamantaka jewel, but found it
not. He then returned to Balabhadra, and told him that they had effected
the death of Śatadhanwan to no purpose, for the precious gem, the
quintessence of all worlds, was not upon his person. When Balabhadra
heard this, he flew into a violent rage, and said to Vásudeva, "Shame
light upon you, to be thus greedy of wealth! I acknowledge no
brotherhood with you. Here lies my path. Go whither you please; I have
done with Dwáraká, with you, with all our house. It is of no use to seek
to impose upon me with thy perjuries." Thus reviling his brother, who
fruitlessly endeavoured to appease him, Balabhadra went to the city of
Videha, where Janaka <span id="fr_1156"></span>[12](#fn_1156.md) received
him hospitably, and there he remained. Vásudeva returned to Dwáraká. It
was during his stay in the dwelling of Janaka that Duryodhana, the son
of Dhritarásht́ra, learned from Balabhadra the art of fighting with the
mace. At the expiration of three years, Ugrasena and other chiefs of the
Yádavas, being satisfied that Krishńa had not the jewel, went to Videha,
and removed Balabhadra's suspicions, and brought him home.

Akrúra, carefully considering the treasures which the precious jewel
secured to him, constantly celebrated religious rites, and, purified
with holy prayers <span id="fr_1157"></span>[13](#fn_1157.md), lived in
affluence for fifty-two years; and through the

<span id="page_431">p. 431</span>

virtue of that gem there was no dearth nor pestilence in the whole
country <span id="fr_1158"></span>[14](#fn_1158.md). At the end of that
period, Śatrughna, the great grandson of Satwata, was killed by the
Bhojas, and as they were in bonds of alliance with Akrúra, he
accompanied them in their flight from Dwáraká. From the moment of his
departure various calamities, portents, snakes, dearth, plague, and the
like, began to prevail; so that he whose emblem is Garúda called
together the Yádavas, with Balabhadra and Ugrasena, and recommended them
to consider how it was that so many prodigies should have occurred at
the same time. On this Andhaka, one of the elders of the Yadhu race,
thus spake: "Wherever Śwaphalka, the father of Akrúra, dwelt, there
famine, plague, dearth, and other visitations were unknown. Once when
there was want of rain in the kingdom of Kásirájá, Śwaphalka was brought
there, and immediately there fell rain from the heavens. It happened
also that the queen of Káśírájá conceived, and was quick with a
daughter; but when the time of delivery arrived, the child issued not
from the womb. Twelve years passed away, and still the girl was unborn.
Then Káśírájá spake to the child, and said, 'Daughter, why is your birth
thus delayed? come forth; I desire to behold you, why do you inflict
this protracted suffering upon your mother?' Thus addressed, the infant
answered, 'If, father, you will present a cow every day to the Brahmans,
I shall at the end of three years more be born.' The king accordingly
presented daily a cow to the Brahmans, and at the end of three years the
damsel came into the world. Her father called her Gándiní, and he
subsequently gave her to Śwaphalka, when he came to his palace for his
benefit. Gándiní, as long as she lived, gave a cow to the Brahmans every
day. Akrúra was her

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

son by Śwaphalka, and his birth therefore proceeds from a combination of
uncommon excellence. When a person such as he is, is absent from us, is
it likely that famine, pestilence, and prodigies should fail to occur?
Let him then he invited to return: the faults of men of exalted worth
must not be too severely scrutinized."

Agreeably to the advice of Audhaka the elder, the Yádavas sent a
mission, headed by Keśava, Ugrasena, and Balabhadra, to assure Akrúra
that no notice would be taken of any irregularity committed by him; and
having satisfied him that he was in no danger, they brought him back to
Dwáraká. Immediately on his arrival, in consequence of the properties of
the jewel, the plague, dearth, famine, and every other calamity and
portent, ceased. Krishńa, observing this, reflected <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[15](#fn_1159.md) that the descent of Akrúra from
Gándiní and Śwaphalka was a cause wholly disproportionate to such an
effect, and that some more powerful influence must be exerted to arrest
pestilence and famine. "Of a surety," said he to himself, "the great
Syamantaka jewel is in his keeping, for such I have heard are amongst
its properties. This Akrúra too has been lately celebrating sacrifice
after sacrifice; his own means are insufficient for such expenses; it is
beyond a doubt that he has the jewel." Having come to this conclusion,
he called a meeting of all the Yádavas at his house, under the pretext
of some festive celebration. When they were all seated, and the. purport
of their assembling had been explained, and the business accomplished,
Krishńa entered into conversation with Akrúra, and, after laughing and
joking, said to him, "Kinsman, you are a very prince in your liberality;
but we know very well that the precious jewel which was stolen by
Sudhanwan was delivered by him to you, and is now in your possession, to
the great benefit of this kingdom. So let it remain; we all derive
advantage from its virtues.

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But Balabhadra
suspects that I have it, and therefore, out of kindness to me, shew it
to the assembly." When Akrúra, who had the jewel with him, was thus
taxed, he hesitated what he should do. "If I deny that I have the
jewel," thought he, "they will search my person, and find the gem hidden
amongst my clothes. I cannot submit to a search." So reflecting, Akrúra
said to Náráyańa, the cause of the whole world, "It is true that the
Syamantaka jewel was entrusted to me by Śatadhanwan, when he went from
hence. I expected every day that you would ask me for it, and with much
inconvenience therefore I have kept it until now. The charge of it has
subjected me to so much anxiety, that I have been incapable of enjoying
any pleasure, and have never known a moment's ease. Afraid that you
would think me unfit to retain possession of a jewel so essential to the
welfare of the kingdom, I forbore to mention to you its being in my
hands; but now take it yourself, and give the care of it to whom you
please." Having thus spoken, Akrúra drew forth from his garments a small
gold box, and took from it the jewel. On displaying it to the assembly
of the Yádavas, the whole chamber where they sat was illuminated by its
radiance. "This," said Akrúra, "is the Syamantaka gem, which was
consigned to me by Śatadhanwan: let him to whom it belongs now take it."

When the Yádavas beheld the jewel, they were filled with astonishment,
and loudly expressed their delight. Balabhadra immediately claimed the
jewel as his property jointly with Achyuta, as formerly agreed upon;
whilst Satyabhámá, demanded it as her right, as it had originally
belonged to her father. Between these two Krishńa considered himself as
an ox between the two wheels of a cart, and thus spake to Akrúra in the
presence of all the Yádavas: "This jewel has been exhibited to the
assembly in order to clear my reputation; it is the joint right of
Balabhadra and myself, and is the patrimonial inheritance of Satyabhámá.
But this jewel, to be of advantage to the whole kingdom, should be taken
charge of by a person who leads a life of perpetual continence: if worn
by an impure individual, it will be the cause of his death. Now as I
have sixteen thousand wives, I am not qualified to have the care of it.
It is not likely that Satyabhámá will agree to the

<span id="page_434">p. 434</span>

conditions that would entitle her to the possession of the jewel; and as
to Balabhadra, he is too much addicted to wine and the pleasures of
sense to lead a life of self-denial. We are therefore out of the
question, and all the Yádavas, Balabhadra, Satyabhámá, and myself,
request you, most bountiful Akrúra, to retain the care of the jewel, as
you have done hitherto, for the general good; for you are qualified to
have the keeping of it, and in your hands it has been productive of
benefit to the country. You must not decline compliance with our
request." Akrúra, thus urged, accepted the jewel, and thenceforth wore
it publicly round his neck, where it shone with dazzling brightness; and
Akrúra moved about like the sun, wearing a garland of light.

He who calls to mind the vindication of the character of Krishńa from
false aspersions, shall never become the subject of unfounded accusation
in the least degree, and living in the full exercise of his senses shall
be cleansed from every sin <span id="fr_1160"></span>[16](#fn_1160.md).

Matsya, and Váyu <span id="page_425">p. 425</span> agree in the main, as
to the genealogy that follows, with our text. The Váyu states that
Vrishńi had two wives, Mádrí and Gándhárí; by the former he had Yudhájit
and Anamitra, and by the latter Sumitra and Devamíd́hush. The Matsya also
names the ladies, but gives Sumitra to Gándhárí, and makes Mádrí the
mother of Yudhájit, Devamíd́husha, Anamitra, and Śini. The Agni has a
similar arrangement, but substitutes Dhrisht́a for Vrishńi, and makes him
the fifteenth in descent from Satwata. The Linga, Padma, Bráhma P., and
Hari V. have made great confusion by altering, apparently without any
warrant, the name of Vrishńi to Krosht́ri.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[425:9](vp106.htm#fr_1153.md) The Bhágavata makes

note, his brothers as well as Sumitra's.

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[430:13](vp106.htm#fr_1157.md) The text gives the
commencement of the prayer, but the commentator does not say whence it
is taken: 'Oh, goddess! the <span id="page_431">p. 431</span> murderer
of a Kshatriya or Vaiśya, engaged in religious duties, is the slayer of
a Brahman;' i. e. the crime is equally heinous. Perhaps the last word
should be \#\#\# 'is.'

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[431:14](vp106.htm#fr_1158.md) Some of the
circumstances of this marvellous gem seem to identify it with a stone of
widely diffused celebrity in the East, and which, according to the
Mohammedan writers, was given originally by Noah to Japhet; the Hijer al
mattyr of the Arabs, Sang yeddat of the Persians, and Jeddah tash of the
Turks, the possession of which secures rain and fertility. The author of
the Habib us Seir gravely asserts that this stone was in the hands of
the Mongols in his day, or in the tenth century.

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[432:15](vp106.htm#fr_1159.md) Krishńa's
reflecting, the commentator observes, is to be understood of him only as
consistent with the account here given of him, as if he were a mere man;
for, as he was omniscient, there was no occasion for him to reflect or
reason. Krishńa however appears in this story in a very different light
from that in which he is usually represented; and the adventure, it may
be remarked, is detached from the place in which we might have expected
to find it, the narrative of his life, which forms the subject of the
next book.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[434:16](vp106.htm#fr_1160.md) The story of the
Syamantaka gem occurs in the Bhágavata, Váyu, Matsya, Bráhma, and Hari
V., and is alluded to in other Puráńas. It may be considered as one
common to the whole series. Independently of the part borne in it by
