### CHAP. III.

Description of Bhárata-varsha: extent: chief mountains: nine divisions:
principal rivers and mountains of Bhárata proper: principal nations:
superiority over other Varshas, especially as the seat of religious
acts. (Topographical lists.)

THE country that lies north of the ocean, and south of the snowy
mountains, is called Bhárata, for there dwelt the descendants of
Bharata. It is nine thousand leagues in extent <span
id="fr_389"></span>[1](#fn_389.md), and is the land of works, in
consequence of which men go to heaven, or obtain emancipation.

The seven main chains of mountains in Bhárata are Mahendra, Malaya,
Sahya, Śuktimat, Riksha, Vindhya, and Páripátra <span
id="fr_390"></span>[2](#fn_390.md).

From this region heaven is obtained, or even, in some cases, liberation

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

from existence; or men pass from hence into the condition of brutes, or
fall into hell. Heaven, emancipation, a state in mid-air, or in the
subterraneous realms, succeeds to existence here, and the world of acts
is not the title of any other portion of the universe.

The Varsha of Bhárata is divided into nine portions, which I will name
to you; they are Indra-dwípa, Kaserumat, Támravarńa, Gabhastimat,
Nága-dwípa, Saumya, Gandharba, and Váruńa; the last or ninth Dwípa is
surrounded by the ocean, and is a thousand Yojanas from north to
south <span id="fr_391"></span>[3](#fn_391.md).

On the east of Bhárata dwell the Kirátas (the barbarians); on the west,
the Yavanas; in the centre reside Brahmans, Kshetriyas, Vaiśyas, and
Śúdras, occupied in their respective duties of sacrifice, arms, trade,
and service <span id="fr_392"></span>[4](#fn_392.md).

The Śatadru, Chandrabhágá, and other rivers, flow from the foot of

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Himálaya: the
Vedasmriti and others from the Parípátra mountains: the Narmadá and
Surasá from the Vindhya hills: the Tápí, Payoshńí, and Nirvindhyá from
the Riksha mountains; the Godáverí, Bhimarathí, Krishńavení, and others,
from the Sahya mountains: the Kritamálá, Támraparńí, and others, from
the Malaya hills: the Trisámá, Rishikulyá, &c. from the Mahendra: and
the Rishikulyá, Kumárí, and others, from the Śuktimat mountains. Of such
as these, and of minor rivers, there is an infinite number; and many
nations inhabit the countries on their borders <span
id="fr_393"></span>[5](#fn_393.md).

The principal nations of Bhárata are the Kurus and Pánchálas, in the
middle districts: the people of Kámarupa, in the east: the Puńd́ras,

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kalingas,
Magadhas, and southern nations, are in the south: in the extreme west
are the Saurásht́ras, Śúras, Bhíras, Arbudas: the Kárushas and Málavas,
dwelling along the Páripátra mountains: the Sauvíras, the Saindhavas,
the Húnas, the Sálwas, the people of Śákala, the Madras, the Rámas, the
Ambasht́has, and the Párasíkas, and others. These nations drink of the
water of the rivers above enumerated, and inhabit their borders, happy
and prosperous <span id="fr_394"></span>[6](#fn_394.md).

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

In the Bhárata-varsha it is that the succession of four Yugas, or ages,
the Krita, the Treta, the Dwápara, and Kali, takes place; that pious
ascetics engage in rigorous penance; that devout men offer sacrifices;
and that gifts are distributed; all for the sake of another world. In
Jambu-dwípa, Vishńu, consisting of sacrifice, is worshipped, as the male
of sacrificial rites, with sacrificial ceremonies: he is adored under
other forms elsewhere. Bhárata is therefore the best of the divisions of
Jambu-dwípa, because it is the land of works: the others are places of
enjoyment alone. It is only after many thousand births, and the
aggregation of much merit, that living beings are sometimes born in
Bhárata as men. The gods themselves exclaim, "Happy are those who are
born, even from the condition of gods, as men in Bhárata-varsha, as that
is the way to the pleasures of Paradise, or the greater blessing of
final liberation. Happy are they who, consigning all the unheeded
rewards of their acts to the supreme and eternal Vishńu, obtain
existence in that land of works, as their path to him. We know not, when
the acts that have obtained us heaven shall have been fully
recompensed <span id="fr_395"></span>[7](#fn_395.md), where we shall renew
corporeal confinement; but we know that those men are fortunate who are
born with perfect faculties <span id="fr_396"></span>[8](#fn_396.md) in
Bhárata-varsha."

I have thus briefly described to you, Maitreya, the nine divisions of
Jambu-dwípa, which is a hundred thousand Yojanas in extent, and which is
encircled, as if by a bracelet, by the ocean of salt water, of similar
dimensions.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_389"></span>[174:1](vp060.htm#fr_389.md) As Bhárata-varsha
means India, a nearer approach to the truth, with regard to its extent,
might have been expected; and the Váyu has another measurement, which is
not much above twice the actual extent, or 1000 Yojanas from Kumári
(Comorin) to the source of the Ganges.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[174:2](vp060.htm#fr_390.md) These are called the
Kula parvatas, family mountains, or mountain ranges or systems. They are
similarly enumerated in all the authorities, and their situation may be
determined with some confidence by the rivers which flow from them.
Mahendra is the chain of hills that extends from Orissa and the northern
Circars to Gondwana, part of which, near Ganjam, is still called
Mahindra Malei, or hills of Mahindra: Malaya is the southern portion of
the western Ghats: Śuktimat is doubtful, for none of its streams can be
identified with any certainty: Sahya is the northern portion of the
western Ghauts, the mountains of the Konkan: Riksha is the mountains of
Gondwana: Vindhya is the general name of the chain that stretches across
central India, but it is here restricted to the eastern division;
according to the Váyu it is the part south of the Narmada, or the
Sathpura range: Páripátra, as frequently written Páriyátra, is the
northern and western portion of the Vindhya: the name, indeed, is still
given to a range of mountains in Guzerat (see Col. Tod's map of
Rajasthán), but the Chambal and other rivers of Málwa, which are said to
flow from the Páriyátra mountains, do not rise in that province. All
these mountains therefore belong to one system, and are connected
together. The classification seems to have been known to Ptolemy, as he
specifies seven ranges of mountains, although his names do not
correspond, with exception of the Vindus mons: of the others, the
Adisathrus and Uxentus agree nearly in position with the Páriyátra and
Riksha: the Apocopi, Sardonix, Bettigo, and Orudii must be left for
consideration. The Bhágavata, Váyu, Padma, and Márkańd́eya add a list of
inferior mountains to these seven.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[175:3](vp060.htm#fr_391.md) This last is
similarly left without a name in all the works: it is the most
southerly, that on the borders of the sea, and no doubt intends India
proper. Wilford places Isere a division called Kumáriká. No description
is anywhere attempted of the other divisions. To these the Váyu adds six
minor Dwípas, which are situated beyond sea, and are islands,
Anga-dwípa, Yama-d., Matsya-d., Kumuda or Kuśa-d., Varáha-d., and
Sankha-d.; peopled for the most part by Mlechchhas, but who worship
Hindu divinities. The Bhágavata and Padma name eight such islands,
Swarńaprastha, Chandraśukla, Avarttana, Rámańaka, Mandahára,
Pánchajanya, Sinhalá, and Lanká. Col. Wilford has endeavoured to verify
the first series of Upadwípas, making Varáha Europe; Kuśa, Asia Minor,
&c.; Śankha, Africa; Malaya, Malacca: Yama is undetermined; and by Anga,
he says, they understand China. How all this may be is more than
doubtful, for in the three Puráńas in which mention is made of them,
very little more is said upon the subject.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[175:4](vp060.htm#fr_392.md) By Kirátas, foresters
and mountaineers are intended, the inhabitants to the present day of the
mountains east of Hindustan. The Yavanas, on the west, may be either the
Greeks of Bactria and the Punjab--to whom there can be little doubt the
term was applied by the Hindus--or the Mohammedans, who succeeded them
in a later period, and to whom it is now applied. The Váyu calls them
both Mlechchhas, and also notices the admixture of barbarians with
Hindus in India proper. The same passage, slightly varied, occurs in the
Mahábhárata: it is said especially of the mountainous districts, and may
allude therefore to the Gonds and Bhils of central India, as well as to
the Mohammedans of the north-west. The specification implies that
infidels and outcastes had not yet descended on the plains of Hindustan.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[176:5](vp060.htm#fr_393.md) This is a very meagre
list, compared with those given in other Puráńas. That of the Váyu is
translated by Col. Wilford, As. Res. vol. VIII; and much curious
illustration of many of the places by the same writer occurs, As. Res.
vol. XIV. The lists of the Mahábhárata, Bhágavata, and Padma are given
without any arrangement: those of the Váyu, Matsya, Márkańd́eya, and
Kúrma are classed as in the text. Their lists are too long for insertion
in this place. Of the rivers named in the text, most are capable of
verification. The Śatadru, 'the hundred channelled'--the Zaradrus of
Ptolemy, Hesidrus of Pliny--is the Setlej. The Chandrabhágá, Sandabalis,
or Acesines, is the Chinab. The Vedasmriti in the Váyu and Kúrma is
classed with the Vetravatí or Betwa, the Charmanwati or Chambal, and
Siprá and Párá, rivers of Malwa, and may be the same with the Beos of
the maps. The Narmadá or Narbadda, the Namadus of Ptolemy, is well
known; according to the Váyu it rises, not in the Vindhya, but in the
Riksha mountains, taking its origin in fact in Gondwana. The Surasá is
uncertain. The Tápí is the Tápti, rising also in Gondwana: the other two
are not identified. The Godaveri preserves its name: in the other two we
have the Beemah and the Krishńa. For Kritamálá the Kúrma reads Ritumálá,
but neither is verified. The Támraparní is in Tinivelly, and rises at
the southern extremity of the western Ghats. The Rishikulyá, that rises
in the Mahendra mountain, is the Rasikulia or Rasíkoila, which flows
into the sea near Ganjam. The Trisámá is undetermined. The text assigns
another Rishikulyá to the Śuktimat mountains, but in all the other
authorities the word is Rishíka. The Kumárí might suggest some connexion
with Cape Comorin, but that the Malaya mountains seem to extend to the
extreme south. A Rishikulyá river is mentioned (Vana P. v. 3026) as a
Tírtha in the Mahábhárata, in connexion apparently with the hermitage of
Vaśisht́ha, which in another passage (v. 4096) is said to be on mount
Arbuda or Abu. In that case, and if the reading of the text be admitted
for the name of the river, the Śuktimat range would be the mountains of
Guzerat; but this is doubtful.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[177:6](vp060.htm#fr_394.md) The list of nations
is as scanty as that of the rivers: it is, however, omitted altogether
in the Bhágavata. The Padma has a long catalogue, but without
arrangement; so has the Mahábhárata. The lists of the Váyu, Matsya, and
Márkańd́eya class the nations as central, northern, eastern, southern,
and western. The names are much the same in all, and are given in the
8th vol. of the As. Res. from the Brahmáńd́a, or, for it is the same
account, the Váyu. The Márkańd́eya has a second classification, and,
comparing Bhárata-varsha to a tortoise, with its head to the east,
enumerates the countries in the head, tail, flanks, and feet of the
animal. It will be sufficient here to attempt an identification of the
names in the text, but some further illustration is offered at the end
of the chapter. The Kurus are the people of Kurukshetra, or the upper
part of the Doab, about Delhi. The Pánchálas, it appears from the
Mahábhárata, occupied the lower part of the Doab, extending across the
Jumna to the Chambal. Kullúka Bhat́t́a, in his commentary on Manu, II. 59,
places them at Kanoj. Kámarupa is the north-eastern part of Bengal, and
western portion of Asam. Puńd́ra is Bengal proper, with part of south
Behar and the Jungle Mahals. Kalinga is the sea-coast west of the mouths
of the Ganges, with the upper part of the Coromandel coast. Magadhá is
Behar. The Saurásht́ras are the people of Surat, the Surastrene of
Ptolemy. The Śúras and Bhíras, in the same direction, may be the Suri
and Phauni or Phryni of Strabo. The Arbudas must be the people about
mount Abu, or the natives of Mewar. The Kárushas and Málavas are of
course the people of Malwa. The Sauvíras and Saindhavas are usually
conjoined as the Sindhu-Sauvíras, and must be the nations of Sindh and
western Rajputána. By the Minas we are to understand the white Huns or
Indo-Scythians, who were established in the Punjab and along the Indus
at the commencement of our era, as we know from Arrian, Strabo, and
Ptolemy, confirmed by recent discoveries of their coins, The Śálwas or,
as also read, Śályas are placed by the Váyu and Matsya amongst the
central nations, and seem to have occupied part of Rájasthan, a Śálwa
Rája being elsewhere described as engaging in hostilities with the
people of Dwaraká in Guzerat. Śákala, as I have elsewhere noticed, is a
city in the Punjab (As. Res. XV. 108), the Sagala of Ptolemy (ibid.
107); the Mahábhárata makes it the capital of the Madras, the Mardi of
the ancients; but they are separately named in the text, and were
situated something more to the south-east. <span id="page_178">p.
178</span> The Rámas and Ambasht́has are not named in the other Puráńas,
but the latter are amongst the western, or more properly north-western
nations subjugated by Nakula, in his Dig-vijaya. Mahábh. Sabhá P. Ambas
and Ambasht́has are included in the list extracted by Col. Wilford from
the Varáha Sanhitá, and the latter are supposed by him to be the Ambastæ
of Arrian. The Párasíkas carry us into Persia, or that part of it
adjoining to the Indus. As far as the enumeration of the text extends,
it seems applicable to the political and geographical divisions of India
about the era of Christianity.

<span id="fn_395"></span>[178:7](vp060.htm#fr_395.md) Enjoyment in Swarga,
like punishment in Naraka, is only for a certain period, according to
the merit or demerit of the individual. When the account is balanced,
the man is born again amongst mankind.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[178:8](vp060.htm#fr_396.md) A crippled or
mutilated person, or one whose organs are defective, cannot at once
obtain liberation; his merits must first secure his being born again
perfect and entire.
