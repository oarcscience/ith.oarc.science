### CHAP. XV.

Bharata relates the story of Ribhu and Nidágha. The latter, the pupil of
the former, becomes a prince, and is visited by his preceptor, who
explains to him the principles of unity, and departs.

PARÁŚARA continued.--Having terminated these remarks, the Brahman
repeated to the silent and meditating prince a tale illustrative of the
doctrines of unity. "Listen, prince," he proceeded, "to what was
formerly uttered by Ribhu, imparting holy knowledge to the Brahman
Nidágha. Ribhu was a son of the supreme Brahmá, who, from his innate
disposition, was of a holy character, and acquainted with true wisdom.
Nidágha, the son of Pulastya, was his disciple; and to him Ribhu
communicated willingly perfect knowledge, not doubting of his being
fully confirmed in the doctrines of unity, when he had been thus
instructed.

"The residence of Pulastya was at Víranagara, a large handsome city on
the banks of the Devíká river. In a beautiful grove adjoining to the
stream the pupil of Ribhu, Nidágha, conversant with devotional
practices, abode. When a thousand divine years had elapsed, Ribhu went
to the city of Pulastya, to visit his disciple. Standing at the doorway,
at the end of a sacrifice to the Viśwadevas, he was seen by his scholar,
who hastened to present him the usual offering, or Arghya, and conducted
him into the house; and when his hands and feet were washed, and he was
seated, Nidágha invited him respectfully to eat (when the following
dialogue ensued):--

"*Ribhu*. 'Tell me, illustrious Brahman, what food there is in your
house; for I am not fond of indifferent viands.'

"*Nidágha*. 'There are cakes of meal, rice, barley, and pulse in the
house; partake, venerable sir, of whichever best pleases you.'

"*Ribhu*. 'None of these do I like; give me rice boiled with sugar,
wheaten cakes, and milk with curds and molasses.'

"*Nidágha*. 'Ho dame, be quick, and prepare whatever is most delicate
and sweet in the house, to feed our guest.'

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

"Having thus spoken, the wife of Nidágha, in obedience to her husband's
commands, prepared sweet and savoury food, and set it before the
Brahman; and Nidágha, having stood before him until he had eaten of the
meal which he had desired, thus reverentially addressed him:--

"*Nidágha*. 'Have you eaten sufficiently, and with pleasure, great
Brahman? and has your mind received contentment from your food? Where is
your present residence? whither do you purpose going? and whence, holy
sir, have you now come?'

"*Ribhu*. 'A hungry man, Brahman, must needs be satisfied when he has
finished his meal. Why should you inquire if my hunger has been
appeased? When the earthy element is parched by fire, then hunger is
engendered; and thirst is produced when the moisture of the body has
been absorbed (by internal or digestive heat). Hunger and thirst are the
functions of the body, and satisfaction must always be afforded me by
that by which they are removed; for when hunger is no longer sensible,
pleasure and contentment of mind are faculties of the intellect: ask
their condition of the mind then, for man is not affected by them. For
your three other questions, Where I dwell? Whither I go? and Whence I
come? hear this reply. Man (the soul of man) goes every where, and
penetrates every where, like the ether; and is it rational to inquire
where it is? or whence or whither thou goest? I neither am going nor
coming, nor is my dwelling in any one place; nor art thou, thou; nor are
others, others; nor am I, I. If you wonder what reply I should make to
your inquiry why I made any distinction between sweetened and
unsweetened food, you shall hear my explanation. What is there that is
really sweet or not sweet to one eating a meal? That which is sweet, is
no longer so when it occasions the sense of repletion; and that which is
not sweet, becomes sweet when a man (being very hungry) fancies that it
is so. What food is there that first, middle, and last is equally
grateful. As a house built of clay is strengthened by fresh plaster, so
is this earthly body supported by earthly particles; and barley, wheat,
pulse, butter, oil, milk, curds, treacle, fruits, and the like, are
composed of atoms of earth. This therefore is to be understood by you,
that the mind which properly judges of what is or is not sweet

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

is impressed with the notion of identity, and that this effect of
identity tends to liberation.'

"Having heard these words, conveying the substance of ultimate truth,
Nidágha fell at the feet of his visitor, and said, 'Shew favour unto me,
illustrious Brahman, and tell me who it is that for my good has come
hither, and by whose words the infatuation of my mind is dissipated.' To
this, Ribhu answered, 'I am Ribhu, your preceptor, come hither to
communicate to you true wisdom; and having declared to you what that is,
I shall depart. Know this whole universe to be the one undivided nature
of the supreme spirit, entitled Vásudeva.' Thus having spoken, and
receiving the prostrate homage of Nidágha, rendered with fervent faith,
Ribhu went his way."
