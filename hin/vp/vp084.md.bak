### CHAP. X.

Ceremonies to be observed at the birth and naming of a child. Of
marrying, or leading a religious life. Choice of a wife. Different modes
of marrying.

SAGARA then addressed Aurva, and said, "You have described to me,
venerable Brahman, the duties of the four orders and of the four castes.
I am now desirous to hear from you the religious institutes which men
should individually observe, whether they be invariable, occasional, or
voluntary. Describe these to me; for all things are known, chief of
Bhrigu's race, unto you." To this Aurva replied, "I will communicate to
you, oh king, that which you have asked, the invariable and occasional
rites which men should perform: do you attend.

"When a son is born, let his father perform for him the ceremonies
proper on the birth of a child, and all other initiatory rites, as well
as a Śráddha, which is a source of prosperity. Let him feed a couple of
Brahmans, seated with their faces to the east; and according to his
means offer sacrifices to the gods and progenitors. Let him present to
the manes <span id="fr_828"></span>[1](#fn_828.md) balls of meat mixed with
curds, barley, and jujubes, with the part of his hand sacred to the
gods, or with that sacred to Prajápati <span
id="fr_829"></span>[2](#fn_829.md). Let a Brahman perform such a Śráddha,
with all its offerings and circumambulations, on every occasion of good
fortune <span id="fr_830"></span>[3](#fn_830.md).

"Next, upon the tenth day after birth, let the father give a name to his
child; the first term of which shall be the appellation of a god, the
second of a man, as Śarman or Varman; the former being the appropriate
designation of a Brahman, the latter of a warrior; whilst Gupta

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

and Dása are best fitted for the names of Vaiśyas and Śúdras <span
id="fr_831"></span>[4](#fn_831.md). A name should not be void of meaning;
it should not be indecent, nor absurd, nor ill-omened, nor fearful; it
should consist of an even number of syllables; it should not be too long
nor too short, nor too full of long vowels; but contain a due proportion
of short vowels, and be easily articulated. After this and the
succeeding initiatory rites <span id="fr_832"></span>[5](#fn_832.md), the
purified youth is to acquire religious knowledge, in the mode that has
been described, in the dwelling of his spiritual guide.

"When he has finished his studies, and given the parting donation to his
preceptor, the man who wishes to lead the life of a householder must
take a wife. If he does not propose to enter into the married state, he
may remain as a student with his teacher, first making a vow to that
effect, and employ himself in the service of his preceptor and of that
preceptor's descendants; or he may at once become a hermit, or adopt the
order of the religious mendicant, according to his original
determination <span id="fr_833"></span>[6](#fn_833.md).

"If he marry, he must select a maiden who is of a third of his age <span
id="fr_834"></span>[7](#fn_834.md); one who has not too much hair, but is
not without any; one who is not

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

very black nor yellow complexioned, and who is not from birth a cripple
or deformed. He must not marry a girl who is vicious or unhealthy, of
low origin, or labouring under disease; one who has been ill brought up;
one who talks improperly; one who inherits some malady from father or
mother; one who has a beard, or who is of a masculine appearance; one
who speaks thick or thin, or croaks like a raven; one who keeps her eyes
shut, or has the eyes very prominent; one who has hairy legs, or thick
ancles; or one who has dimples in her cheeks when she laughs <span
id="fr_835"></span>[8](#fn_835.md). Let not a wise and prudent man marry a
girl of such a description: nor let a considerate man wed a girl of a
harsh skin; or one with white nails; or one with red eyes, or with very
fat hands and feet; or one who is a dwarf, or who is very tall; or one
whose eyebrows meet, or whose teeth are far apart, and resemble tusks.
Let a householder marry a maiden who is in kin at least five degrees
remote from his mother, and seven from his father, with the ceremonies
enjoined by law <span id="fr_836"></span>[9](#fn_836.md).

"The forms of marriage are eight, the Brahmá, Daiva, the Ársha,
Prájápatya, Asúra, Gándharba, Rákshasa, and Paiśácha; which last is the
worst <span id="fr_837"></span>[10](#fn_837.md): but the caste to which
either form has been enjoined as lawful by inspired sages should avoid
any other mode of taking a wife. The householder who espouses a female
connected with him by similarity of religious and civil obligations, and
along with her discharges the duties of his condition, derives from such
a wife great benefits."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_828"></span>[297:1](vp084.htm#fr_828.md) To the Nándímukhas.
The Pitris, or progenitors, are so termed here from words occurring in
the prayer used on the occasion of a festive Śráddha. As. Res. VII. 270.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[297:2](vp084.htm#fr_829.md) With the Daiva
tírtha, the tips of the fingers; or with the Prájapatya tírtha, the part
of the hand at the root of the little finger. Manu, II. 58, 59. The
second is called by Manu the Káya tírtha, from Ka, a synonyme of
Prajápati.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[297:3](vp084.htm#fr_830.md) The Śráddha is
commonly an obsequial or funeral sacrifice, but it implies offerings to
the progenitors of an individual and of mankind, and always forms part
of a religious ceremony on an occasion of rejoicing or an accession of
prosperity, this being termed the Abhyudaya or Vriddhi Śráddha. As. Res.
VII. 270.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[298:4](vp084.htm#fr_831.md) So Manu, II. 30, 31,
32. The examples given in the comment are, Somaśarman, Indravarman,
Chandragupta, and Śivadása, respectively appropriate appellations of men
of the four castes.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[298:5](vp084.htm#fr_832.md) Or Sanskáras;
initiatory ceremonies, purificatory of the individual at various stages.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[298:6](vp084.htm#fr_833.md) Or the vow or pledge
he has taken, that he will follow for life the observances of the
student or ascetic; both of which are enumerated in the Nirńaya Sindhu,
as acts prohibited in the Kali age; a man is not to continue a student
or Brahmáchári, i. e. a cænobite, for life; nor is he to become a
mendicant without previously passing through the order of householder.
In practice, however, the prohibition is not unfrequently disregarded.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[298:7](vp084.htm#fr_834.md) By this is to be
understood, according to the commentator, merely a young girl, but at
the same time one not immature; for otherwise, he observes, a man of
thirty, by which age he completes his sacred studies, would espouse a
girl of but ten years of age. According to Manu, however, the period of
religious study does not terminate until thirty-six; and in the East a
girl of twelve would be marriageable. The text of Yájnawalkya has merely
the word Yavíyasí, 'a very young woman.' It is worthy of remark here,
that neither that text, nor the text of Manu, nor the interpretation of
our text, authorizes the present practice of the nuptials of children.
The obligation imposed upon a man of a life of perfect continence until
he is more than thirty is singularly Malthusian.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[299:8](vp084.htm#fr_835.md) For the credit of
Hindu taste it is to be noticed that the commentator observes the
hemistich in which this last clause occurs is not found in all copies of
the text.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[299:9](vp084.htm#fr_836.md) See Manu, III. 5, &c.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[299:10](vp084.htm#fr_837.md) These different
modes of marriage a described by Manu, III. 27, &c.
