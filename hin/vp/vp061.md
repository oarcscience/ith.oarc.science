### Footnotes

<span id="fn_397"></span>[179:1](vp061.htm#fr_397) In attempting to
verify the places or people specified in the text, various difficulties
are to be encountered, which must serve to apologize for but partial
success. Some are inherent in the subject, such as the changes which
have taken place in the topography of India since the lists were
compiled, and the imperfectness of the specification itself: states and
tribes and cities have disappeared, even from recollection, and some of
the natural features of the country, especially the rivers, have
undergone a total alteration. Buchanan (Description of Eastern
Hindustan), following Rennell over the same ground at an interval of
some thirty or forty years, remarks that many of the streams laid down
in the Bengal Atlas (the only series of maps of India yet published,
that can be regarded as of authority) are no longer to be traced. Then
the lists which are given are such mere catalogues, that they afford no
clue to verification beyond names; and names have been either changed or
so corrupted, as to be no longer recognizable. On the other hand, much
of the difficulty arises from our own want of knowledge. Scattered
through the Puráńas and other works, the names given in the
topographical lists recur with circumstances which fix their locality;
but these means of verification have not yet been sufficiently
investigated. There are also geographical treatises in Sanscrit, which
there is reason to believe afford much accurate and interesting
information: they are not common. Col. Wilford speaks of having received
a number from Jaypur, but upon his death they disappeared. After a
considerable interval some of his MSS. were purchased for the Calcutta
Sanscrit College, but by far the larger portion of his collection had
been dispersed. A few leaves only on geographical subjects were found,
from which I translated and published a chapter on the geography of some
of the districts of Bengal: (Calcutta Quarterly Magazine, Dec. 1824:)
the details were accurate and valuable, though the compilation was
modern. Notwithstanding these impediments, however, we should be able to
identify at least mountains and rivers to a much greater extent than is
now practicable, if our maps were not so miserably defective in their
nomenclature. None of our surveyors or geographers have been Oriental
scholars. It may be doubted if any of them have been conversant with the
spoken language of the country: they have consequently put down names at
<span id="page_180">p. 180</span> random, according to their own
inaccurate appreciation of sounds carelessly, vulgarly, and corruptly
uttered; and their maps of India are crowded with appellations which
bear no similitude whatever either to past or present denominations. We
need not wonder that we cannot discover Sanscrit names in English maps,
when, in the immediate vicinity of Calcutta, Barnagore represents
Varáhanagar, Dakshineswar is metamorphosed into Duckinsore,and Ulubaría
is Anglicised into Willoughbruy. Going a little farther off, we have
Dalkisore for Darikeswarí, Midnapore for Medinipur, and a most
unnecessary accumulation of consonants in Caughmahry for Kákamárí. There
is scarcely a name in our Indian maps that does not afford proof of
extreme indifference to accuracy in nomenclature, and of an
incorrectness in estimating sounds, which is in some degree, perhaps, a
national defect.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[180:2](vp061.htm#fr_398) The printed edition
reads Śaktimat, which is also found in some MSS., but the more usual
reading is that of the text. I may here add that a Śuktimat mountain
occurs in Bhíma's invasion of the eastern region. Mahábh. Sabhá P.
Gandhamádana here takes the place of Riksha.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[180:3](vp061.htm#fr_399) For additional
mountains in the Váyu, see Asiatic Researches, VIII. 334 The Bhágavata,
Padma, and Márkańd́eya add the following: Maináka, which it appears from
the Rámáyańa is at the source of the Sone, that river being termed
Mainákaprabhava. 'Kishkindhya Káńd́a;' Trikút́a, called also in
Hemachanchra's vocabulary Suvela; Rishabha, Kút́aka, Konwa, Devagiri
(Deogur or Ellora, the mountain of the gods; the Apocopi are said by
Ptolemy to be also called mountains of the gods); Rishyamuka, in the
Dekhin, where the Pampá rises; Śrí-śaila or Śrí-parvata, near the
Krishńa (As. Res. V. 303); Venkata, the hill of Tripatí, Váridhára,
Mangala-prastha, Drońa, Chitrakút́a (Chitrakote in Bundelkhand),
Govarddhana (near Mathurá), Raivata, the range that branches off from
the western portion of the Vindhya towards the north, extending nearly
to the Jumna; according to Hemachandra it is the Girińara range; it is
the Aravali of Tod; Kakubha, Níla (the blue mountains of Orissa),
Gohamukha, Indrakíla, Ramagiri (Ram-tek, near Nag-pur), Valakrama,
Sudháma, Tungaprastha, Nága (the hills east of Ramghur), Bodhana,
Pandara, Durjayanta, Arbuda (Abu in Guzerat), Gomanta (in the western
Ghats), Kút́aśaila, Kritasmara, and Chakora. Many single mountains are
named in different works.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[180:4](vp061.htm#fr_400) See note 4, p. 175.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[180:5](vp061.htm#fr_401) The Sarsuti, or
Caggar or Gaggar, N. W. of Tahnesar. See below, note [6](#fn_402).

<span id="fn_402"></span>[181:6](vp061.htm#fr_402) The Báhudá is
elsewhere said to rise in the Himalaya. Wilford considers it to be the
Mahánada, which falls into the Ganges below Malda. The Mahábhárata has
amongst the Tírthas, or places of pilgrimage, two rivers of this name,
one apparently near the Saraswatí, one more to the east. Hemachandra
gives as synonymes Árjuní and Saitaváhiní, both implying the 'white
river:' a main feeder of the Mahánada is called Dhavalí or Daub, which
has the same meaning.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[181:7](vp061.htm#fr_403) The Drishadwatí is a
river of considerable importance in the history of the Hindus, although
no traces of its ancient name exist. According to Manu it is one
boundary of the district called Brahmávartta, in which the institution
of castes, and their several duties, had for ever existed: implying that
in other places they were of more recent origin. This holy land, 'made
by the gods,' was of very limited extent. Its other boundary was the
Saraswatí. That the Drishadwatí was not far off we learn from Manu, as
Kurukshetra, Matsya, Panchála, and Śúrasena, or the upper part of the
Doab, and country to the east, were not included in Brahmávartta; they
constituted Brahmarshi-deśa, contiguous to it: Kullúka Bhat́t́a explains
Anantara, 'something less or inferior;' but it more probably means 'not
divided from,' 'immediately contiguous.' We must look for the
Drishadwatí, therefore, west of the Jumna. In the Tírtha Yátrá of the
Mahábhárata we find it forming one of the boundaries of Kurukshetra. It
is there said, 'Those who dwell on the south of the Saraswatí, and north
of the Drishadwatí, or in Kurukshetra, dwell in heaven.' In the same
place, the confluence of the Drishadwatí with a stream of Kurukshetra,
called the Kauśikí, is said to be of peculiar sanctity. Kurukshetra is
the country about Tahnesur or Stháneśwara, where a spot called Kurukhet
still exists, and is visited in pilgrimage. The Kirin-kshetra of Manu
may be intended for the country of the Kurus, in the more immediate
vicinity of Delhi. According to Wilford, the Drishadwatí is the Caggar;
in which case our maps have taken the liberty of transposing the names
of the rivers, as the Caggar now is the northern stream, and the
Sursooty the southern, both rising in the Himálaya, and uniting to form
one river, called Gagar or Caggar in the maps, but more correctly
Sarsuti or Saraswatí; which then runs south-west, and is lost in the
desert. There have no doubt been considerable changes here, both in the
nomenclature and in the courses of the rivers.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[181:8](vp061.htm#fr_404) The Beyah, Hyphasis,
or Bibasis.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[181:9](vp061.htm#fr_405) The Ráví or Hydraotes
or Adris.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[181:10](vp061.htm#fr_406) The Jhelum, but
still called in Kashmir the Vitastá, the Bidaspes or Hydaspes.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[181:11](vp061.htm#fr_407) This river,
according to the Vishńu P., rises from the Riksha mountains, but the
Váyu and Kúrma bring it from the Vindhya or Sathpura range. There are
several indications of its position in the Mahábhárata, but none very
precise. Its <span id="page_182">p. 182</span> source appears to be near
that of the Krishńa: it flows near the beginning of the Dańd́aka forest,
which should place it rather near to the sources of the Godávarí: it
passes through Vidarbha or Berar, and, Yudhisht́hira having bathed in it,
comes to the Vaidúrya mountain and the Narmadá river. These
circumstances make it likely that the Payín Gangá is the river in
question.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[182:12](vp061.htm#fr_408) The Devá, or Goggra.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[182:13](vp061.htm#fr_409) Both these are from
the Páripátra range. In some MSS. the latter is read Vedasiní and
Vetasiní. In the Rámáyańa occur Vedá and Vedavainasiká, which may be the
same, as they seem to be in the direction of the Sone. One of them may
be the Beos of eastern Malwa, but it rises in the Riksha mountain.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[182:14](vp061.htm#fr_410) From Páripátra,
Kúrma; from Mahendra, Váyu.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[182:15](vp061.htm#fr_411) One copy has
Ikshumáliní; two others, Ikshulá and Krimi: one MS. of the Váyu has an
Ikshulá from Mahendra: the Matsya has Ikshudá; Wilford's list has
Drákshalá.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[182:16](vp061.htm#fr_412) Of these rivers, the
two first are named in the Padma P., but not in the Váyu, &c. The Gomati
in Oude, the Gandak, and the Kosi are well known. The Dhutapápá is said
to rise in the Himálaya.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[182:17](vp061.htm#fr_413) In different MSS.
read Michitá and Nisritá. In the Váyu and Matsya, Niśchirá or Nirvirá is
said to flow from the Himálaya.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[182:18](vp061.htm#fr_414) Also Lohatárańí and
Lohachárińí.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[182:19](vp061.htm#fr_415) The Sarayú or Sarju
is commonly identified with the Deva. Wilford says it is so by the
Pauráńics, but we have here proof to the contrary. They are also
distinguished by the people of the country. Although identical through
great part of their course, they rise as different streams, and again
divide and enter the Ganges by distinct branches.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[182:20](vp061.htm#fr_416) The recurrence of
the same name in this, as in several similar subsequent instances, is
possibly an error of the copyist; but it is also sometimes likely that
one name is applied to different rivers. In one MS. we have, in place of
this word, Chaitravatí; and in another Vetravatí.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[182:21](vp061.htm#fr_417) Read also Śatávarí.
According to Wilford, the Śarávatí is the Ban-gangá.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[182:22](vp061.htm#fr_418) The Váyu has Párá,
which is a river in Malwa, the Párvatí. MSS. read Váńí and Veńá.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[182:23](vp061.htm#fr_419) According to the
Váyu, this rises in the Sahya m., and flows towards the south: it is
therefore the Beema of Aurungabad.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[182:24](vp061.htm#fr_420) The Kaverí is well
known, and has always borne the same appellation, being the Chaberis of
Ptolemy.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[182:25](vp061.htm#fr_421) Read Chuluká.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[182:26](vp061.htm#fr_422) Read also Tápí; the
Taptí river of the Dekhin.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[182:27](vp061.htm#fr_423) Read Ahitá and
Sahitá.

<span id="fn_424"></span>[183:28](vp061.htm#fr_424) Rises in the Sahya
mountain, and flows southwards: Váyu, &c.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[183:29](vp061.htm#fr_425) Read Vichitrá.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[183:30](vp061.htm#fr_426) Several rivers are
called by this name, as well as the Indus: there is one of some note,
the Káli Sindh in Malwa.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[183:31](vp061.htm#fr_427) Also Vájiní.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[183:32](vp061.htm#fr_428) This agrees best in
name with the Beema: it is also mentioned as a tírtha in the
Mahábhárata.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[183:33](vp061.htm#fr_429) From Śuktimat: Kúrma
and Váyu. There is a Balásan from the eastern portion of the Himálaya, a
feeder of the Mahánada, which may be the Palásiní, if the mountain be in
this direction.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[183:34](vp061.htm#fr_430) Also Pippalalávatí.
The Váyu has a Pippalá from the Riksha mountain.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[183:35](vp061.htm#fr_431) Also Kuśavírá.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[183:36](vp061.htm#fr_432) Also Mahiká and
Maruńd́áchí.

<span id="fn_433"></span>[183:37](vp061.htm#fr_433) Also Śená.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[183:38](vp061.htm#fr_434) Read Kritavatí and
Ghritavatí.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[183:39](vp061.htm#fr_435) Also Dhuśulyá.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[183:40](vp061.htm#fr_436) Also Atikrishńa.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[183:41](vp061.htm#fr_437) In place of both
Suvártháchí.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[183:42](vp061.htm#fr_438) From Páripátra: Váyu
and Matsya.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[183:43](vp061.htm#fr_439) Also Kuśanára.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[183:44](vp061.htm#fr_440) Also Śaśikánta.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[183:45](vp061.htm#fr_441) Also Vastrá and
Suvastrá.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[183:46](vp061.htm#fr_442) One of the tírthas
in the Mahábhárata.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[183:47](vp061.htm#fr_443) According to the
Mahábhárata, this rises in the Vaidúrya mountain, part of the southern
Vindhya or Sathpura range.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[183:48](vp061.htm#fr_444) Also Kuvíra.

<span id="fn_445"></span>[183:49](vp061.htm#fr_445) Three MSS. agree in
reading this Ambuváhiní.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[183:50](vp061.htm#fr_446) Also Vainadí.

<span id="fn_447"></span>[183:51](vp061.htm#fr_447) Also Kuveńá: it is
possibly meant for the Tungabhádra or Toombudra.

<span id="fn_448"></span>[183:52](vp061.htm#fr_448) A river in Malwa, so
called from the city of the same name, which I have elsewhere
conjectured to be Bhilsa. Megha Dúta, 31. There is a 'Bess' river in the
maps, which joins the Betwa at Bhilsa, and is probably the river of the
text.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[183:53](vp061.htm#fr_449) The Varna or Suvamá,
'the beautiful river,' Wilford identifies with the Ramgangá.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[183:54](vp061.htm#fr_450) Also Mahapagá, 'the
great river.'

<span id="fn_451"></span>[183:55](vp061.htm#fr_451) Also Kuchchilá.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[183:56](vp061.htm#fr_452) The Sona river,
rising in Maináka or Amarakantak, and flowing east to the Ganges.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[184:57](vp061.htm#fr_453) This and the
preceding both rise from the Vindhya mountain: the latter is also read
Antassilá, 'the river flowing within or amidst rocks.'

<span id="fn_454"></span>[184:58](vp061.htm#fr_454) Also Parokshá.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[184:59](vp061.htm#fr_455) We have a Suraná in
the Váyu, and Surasá in the Kúrma and Matsya, flowing from the Riksha
mountain.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[184:60](vp061.htm#fr_456) The Tamasá or Tonse,
from Riksha.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[184:61](vp061.htm#fr_457) This and the
preceding scarcely merit a place amongst the rivers, being two small
streams which fall into the Ganges east and west of Benares, which is
thence denominated Varanásí.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[184:62](vp061.htm#fr_458) Parńáśá or Varńáśá,
from the Páripátra mountain.

<span id="fn_459"></span>[184:63](vp061.htm#fr_459) Also Mánaví.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[184:64](vp061.htm#fr_460) The Krishńá of the
Dakhin is probably here intended, although its more ordinary designation
seems to be that already specified, Krishńaveńa or Krishńaveńí. The
meaning is much the same; the one being the 'dark river,' the other
simply the 'dark,' the Niger.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[184:65](vp061.htm#fr_461) A river from
Śuktimat: Váyu.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[184:66](vp061.htm#fr_462) A river in Cuttack,
according to Wilford: it is one of the tírthas of the Mahábhárata, and
apparently in a different direction. Buchanan (Eastern Hindustan) has a
river of this name in Dinajpur.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[184:67](vp061.htm#fr_463) Both from the
Vindhya: Váyu and Kúrma. There is a Goaris in Ptolemy in central India.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[184:68](vp061.htm#fr_464) From Riksha: Váyu.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[184:69](vp061.htm#fr_465) Also Munja and
Makaraváhiní.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[184:70](vp061.htm#fr_466) From Riksha: Váyu.
According to the Mahábhárata, it rises in the mountain Chitrakote.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[184:71](vp061.htm#fr_467) The Baitarańí in
Cuttack. It is named in the Mahábhárata as a river of Kalinga.

<span id="fn_468"></span>[184:72](vp061.htm#fr_468) Also read Nípa and
Koka.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[184:73](vp061.htm#fr_469) From Riksha, but
read also Śuktimati, which is the reading of the Matsya. Wilford
considers it to be the Swarnarekka of Cuttack.

<span id="fn_470"></span>[184:74](vp061.htm#fr_470) Also Anágá and
Surangá; perhaps the preferable reading should be Sumangá, a river
.flowing from Maináka, according to the Mahábhárata.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[184:75](vp061.htm#fr_471) Part of the
Brahmaputra.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[184:76](vp061.htm#fr_472) A considerable river
in the east, flowing between Dinajpur and Rangpur.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[184:77](vp061.htm#fr_473) Also Vrishasáhwa.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[184:78](vp061.htm#fr_474) This and the
preceding flow from Śuktimat, according to the [Váyu](errata.htm#6),
Matsya, and Kúrma. The last occurs also Rishíka.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[184:79](vp061.htm#fr_475) Also Suparńá. The
Punyá is [considered](errata.htm#7) to be the Pun-pun of Behan, but
there is also a Parná river in the same province.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[185:80](vp061.htm#fr_476) It is possible that
further research will identify more than those attempted to be verified
in the foregoing notes, as well as meet with others readily
recognizable. In the authorities consulted several occur not
comprehended in the text, as the Kuhu and Ikshu, from the Himálaya;
Vritraghní, Chandaná (Chandan of Bhagalpur), Mahí (the Mahy of western
Malwa), Śiprá, and Avantí (rivers near Ujayin), from Páripátra; Mahánada
in Orissa, Drumá, Dasárńa (Dhosaun in Bundelkhand), Chitrakút́á, Śroní or
Śyená, Piśáchiká, Banjulá, Báluváhiní, and Matkuńá, all from Riksha;
Nirvindhyá, Madrá, Nishadhá, Śinibáhu, Kumudvatí, and Toyá, from
Vindhya; Banjula, from Sahya; Kritamálá, Támraparńí, Pushpajáti, and
Utpalavatí, from Malaya; Lánguliní and Vansadhárá, from Mahendra; and
Mandagá and Kripá or Rúpá, from Śuktimat. In the Rámáyańa we have,
besides some already specified, the Ruchirá, Pampá, eastern Saraswatí,
Vegavatí or Vyki of Madurá, and Varadá or Wurda of Berar; and we have
many others in the Mahábhárata and different works, from which the
Sanscrit appellations of most of the Indian rivers might be, with some
little time and trouble, collected.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[185:1](vp061.htm#fr_477) The people of the
upper part of the Doab. The two words might also be understood as
denoting the Pánchálas of the Kuru country, there being two divisions of
the tribe: see below, note [20](#fn_496).

<span id="fn_478"></span>[185:2](vp061.htm#fr_478) The Śúrasenas were
the inhabitants of Mathura, the Suraseni of Arrian.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[185:3](vp061.htm#fr_479) The people of the
upper part of the Coromandel coast, well known in the traditions of the
eastern Archipelago as Kling. Ptolemy has a city in that part called
Caliga; and Pliny, Calingæ proximi mari.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[185:4](vp061.htm#fr_480) One of the tribes of
central India, according to the Váyu: it is also read Báhyas.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[185:5](vp061.htm#fr_481) The Malas and
Málavarttis are placed, in the Váyu and Matsya, amongst the central
nations. The Márkańd́eya reads Gavavarttis. Wilford considers Mála to be
the Mal-bhúm of Medinipur. As noticed in the Megha Dúta, I have supposed
it to be situated in Chattisgarh. p. 21, note.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[185:6](vp061.htm#fr_482) The people of
Dinajpur, Rangpur, and Cooch Behar. Calcutta Mag. Dec. 1824.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[185:7](vp061.htm#fr_483) Read Kuśańd́as,
Kuśalyas, Kuśádhyas, Kisádhajas, and placed in central India.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[185:8](vp061.htm#fr_484) Also Sauśalyas and
Sauśulyas.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[185:9](vp061.htm#fr_485) Kuntala is in one
place one of the central countries; in another, one of the southern: the
name is applied in inscriptions <span id="page_186">p. 186</span> to the
province in which Curgode is situated, part of the Adoni district: (As.
Res. IX. 427:) and consistently with this position it is placed amongst
the dependant or allied states of Vidarbha in the Dada Kumára. Calcutta
Quarterly Mag. Sept. 1827.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[186:10](vp061.htm#fr_486) A central nation:
Váyu. The Rámáyana places them in the east. The combination indicates
the country between Benares and Oude.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[186:11](vp061.htm#fr_487) Chedi is usually
considered as Chandail, on the west of the Jungle Mehals, towards
Nagpur. It is known, in times subsequent to the Puráńas, as Rańastambha.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[186:12](vp061.htm#fr_488) Some copies read
Vatsa, and the other Puráńas have such a name amongst the central
countries; the people perhaps of Vatsa, Rája of Kausámbhí, near the
junction of the Jumna and the Ganges. There are, however, two Matsyas,
one of which, according to the Yantra Samrát́, is identifiable with
Jaypur. In the Dig-vijaya of Nakula he subdues the Matsyas farther to
the west, or in Guzerat.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[186:13](vp061.htm#fr_489) Situated on the back
of the Vindhya range: Váyu and Matsya. They are generally named with the
people of Málava, which confirms this locality. They are said to be the
posterity of Karusha, one of the sons of Vaivaswata Manu.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[186:14](vp061.htm#fr_490) These are also
placed along the Vindhya chain, but at different times appear to have
occupied different positions. They were a kindred tribe with the
Andhakas and Vrishńis, and a branch of the Yádavas. A Bhoja Rájá is
amongst the warriors of the Mahábhárata. At a later period, Bhoja, the
Rájá of Dhár, preserves an indication of this people; and from him the
Bhojpuris, a tribe still living in western Behar, profess to be
descended: they are not improbably relics of the older tribe. Bhoja is
also used sometimes as a synonyme of Bhojakat́a, a city near the Narmadá,
founded by Rukmi, brother-in-law of Krishńa, and before that, prince of
Kundińa or Condavir.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[186:15](vp061.htm#fr_491) Pulinda is applied
to any wild or barbarous tribe; those here named are some of the people
of the deserts along the Indus; but Pulindas are met with in many other
positions, especially in the mountains and forests across central India,
the haunts of the Bhils and Gonds. So Ptolemy places the Pulindai along
the banks of the Narmadá to the frontiers of Larice; the Lát́a or Lar of
the Hindus; Kandesh and part. of Guzerat.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[186:16](vp061.htm#fr_492) In the other three
Puráńas we have Uttámárńas, on the Vindhya range.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[186:17](vp061.htm#fr_493) The people of the
'ten forts,' subsequently multiplied to 'thirty-six,' such being the
import of Chattisgerh, which seems to be in the site of Dasárńa. Megha
Dúta, p. 30, note.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[186:18](vp061.htm#fr_494) A Vindhya tribe,
according to the other Puráńas. The locality is confirmed by
mythological personations; for Mekala is said to be a Rishi, the father
of the river Narmadá; thence called Mekalá and Mekalakanyá: the mountain
where it rises is also called Mekaládri. The Rámáyańa places the Mekalas
amongst the southern tribes.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[186:19](vp061.htm#fr_495) Utkala is still the
native name of Orissa.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[186:20](vp061.htm#fr_496) These may be the
southern Pańchálas. <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> When Drońa
overcame Drupada, king of Panchála, as related in the Mahábhárata, Ádi
Parva, he retained half the country, that north of the Ganges, and
restored to its former chief the other half, south of that river as far
as to the Chambal. The capital of the latter became Mákandi on the
Ganges; and the country included also Kámpilya, the Kampil of the
Mohammedans, but placed by them in the Doab. The capital of the northern
portion was Ahikshetra, a name traceable in the Adisathrus of Ptolemy,
though the position differs: but Ahikshetra or Ahichchatra, as it is
also written, seems to have been applied to more than one city.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[187:21](vp061.htm#fr_497) Perhaps the people
of Tirhut, along the Kosi.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[187:22](vp061.htm#fr_498) 'Having more than
one back;' probable some nickname or term of derision. Thus we have, in
the Rámáyańa and other works, enumerated amongst tribes, the
Karńa-právarańas, 'those who wrap themselves up in their ears;'
Asht́a-karńakas, 'the eight-eared;' or Osht́ha-karńakas, 'having lips
extending to their ears;' Kákamukhas, 'crow-faced;' Ekapádukas,
'one-footed,' or rather 'one-slippered:' exaggerations of national
ugliness, or allusions to peculiar customs, which were not literally
intended, although they may have furnished the Mandevilles of ancient
and modern times with some of their monsters. The spirit of the
nomenclature is shewn by these tribes being associated with Kirátas,
'barbarians,' and Yavanas, either Greeks or Mohammedans.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[187:23](vp061.htm#fr_499) A preferable reading
seems to be Yugandhara: a city in the Punjab so called is mentioned in
the Mahábhárata, Karńa P.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[187:24](vp061.htm#fr_500) Read Bodhas, Godhas,
and Saudhas. There is a Rajput tribe called Sodha.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[187:25](vp061.htm#fr_501) This may consist of
two names, and is so read in MSS., or the latter term occurs Kalingas;
both terms are repeated. Besides the Machu of the north, a similar
word,. Madru, is applied to Madura in the south. As. Res. IX. 428. The
Rámáyańa has Madras in the east, as well as in the north.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[187:26](vp061.htm#fr_502) The people of the
Benares district, and that opposite.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[187:27](vp061.htm#fr_503) The inhabitants of
Ujayin.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[187:28](vp061.htm#fr_504) These should be
opposite to the Kuntis, but where either is situated does not appear.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[187:29](vp061.htm#fr_505) The best reading is
Gomanta, part of the Konkan about Goa.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[187:30](vp061.htm#fr_506) The more usual
reading is Khańd́as; one MS. has Parńas.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[187:31](vp061.htm#fr_507) A country of
considerable extent and power at various periods. The name remains in
Beder, which may have been the ancient capital; but the kingdom seems to
have corresponded with the great part of Berar and Kandesh. It is
mentioned in the Rámáyańa and the Puráńas amongst the countries of the
south.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[187:32](vp061.htm#fr_508) Also Rúpavásikas.
There is a Rupá river from the Śuktimat mountain, the vicinity of which
may be alluded to. We have Rúpasas or Rúpapas amongst the southern
tribes of the Puráńas.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[188:33](vp061.htm#fr_509) Read also Aśmalas
and Aśmakas: the latter are enumerated amongst the people of the south
in the Rámáyańa, and in the Váyu, Matsya, and Márkańd́eya P. There is a
prince of the same name of the solar dynasty.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[188:34](vp061.htm#fr_510) Gova or Kuva is an
ancient name of the southern Konkan, and may be intended in this place
by the Gopa country; or it may imply 'the district of cow-herds,' that
is, of Nomadic tribes.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[188:35](vp061.htm#fr_511) Also read Kulatis
and Páńítakas.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[188:36](vp061.htm#fr_512) Read also Adhirájya
and Adhirásht́ra, which mean the same, 'the over or superior kingdom.'

<span id="fn_513"></span>[188:37](vp061.htm#fr_513) Also Kuśádhya,
Kuśánda, and Mukuntha.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[188:38](vp061.htm#fr_514) Also Vallirásht́ra.
There are Mallas in the east, along the foot of the Himalaya, in Bhíma's
Dig-vijaya; but we should rather look for them in the north-west, in the
site of the Malli of Arrian. We have in the Puráńas, Mahárásht́ra, the
Mahratta country, which may be here intended.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[188:39](vp061.htm#fr_515) Two copies read
Kevala; one, Kambala, The text is probably wrong, as we have Kerala
below.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[188:40](vp061.htm#fr_516) Also Váráyásis and
Varavásis: one copy has, what is likely to be most correct, Vánarásyas,
the monkey-faced people.'

<span id="fn_517"></span>[188:41](vp061.htm#fr_517) Read Upaváha and
Praváha.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[188:42](vp061.htm#fr_518) The MSS. agree in
reading this Vakra.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[188:43](vp061.htm#fr_519) The Śakas occur
again, more than once, which may be possibly unnecessary repetition: but
these people, the Sakai and Sacæ of classical writers, the
Indo-Scythians of Ptolemy, extended, about the commencement of our era,
along the west of India, from the Hindu Koh to the mouths of the Indus.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[188:44](vp061.htm#fr_520) The inhabitants of
Tirhut.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[188:45](vp061.htm#fr_521) The people of South
Bahar.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[188:46](vp061.htm#fr_522) Also read Mahyas and
Suhmas: the latter is probably correct. The Suhmas and Prasuhmas were
found in the east by Bhíma; and Suhma is elsewhere said to be situated
east of Bengal, towards the sea, the king and the people being
Mlechchhas, that is not Hindus: it would correspond therefore with
Tiperah and Aracan.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[188:47](vp061.htm#fr_523) Also read Malajas,
but less correctly perhaps. The Malayas are the people of the southern
Ghats.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[188:48](vp061.htm#fr_524) We have Pravijayas
in the east, according to the Puráńas.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[188:49](vp061.htm#fr_525) Anga is the country
about Bhagalpur, of which Champá was the capital.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[188:50](vp061.htm#fr_526) Eastern Bengal.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[188:51](vp061.htm#fr_527) We have had these
before, but they are repeated perhaps in conformity to the usual
classification, which connects them with the two preceding, being
derived in the genealogical lists from a common ancestor.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[188:52](vp061.htm#fr_528) In Bhíma's
Dig-vijaya we have two people of this name, both in the east; one along
the foot of the Himálaya, and the other more to the south.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[188:53](vp061.htm#fr_529) Uniformly read in
the MSS. Sudeshńa.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[188:54](vp061.htm#fr_530) Three copies read
Máhishas. We <span id="page_189">p. 189</span> have Mahishakas amongst
the southern people in the Puráńas; and a Máhishikí in the Rámáyańa,
also in the south: the latter may be connected with Máhishmatí, which
Sahadeva visits in his southern invasion, and which has been elsewhere
conjectured to be in Mysur. (Calcutta Annual Register, 1822,) There is
also a Máhishmatí on the road to the south (Mahábh. Udyoga P.), which is
commonly identified with Chulí Maheśwar, on the Narmadá.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[189:55](vp061.htm#fr_531) Also Rishíkas;
people placed by the Rámáyańa both in the north and in the south. Arjuna
visits the former, and exacts from them eight horses. Dig-vijaya.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[189:56](vp061.htm#fr_532) Also read Báhíkas,
which we may here prefer, as the Báhlíkas are subsequently named: the
former are described in the Mahábhárata, Karńa Parva, with some detail,
and comprehend the different nations of the Punjab, from the Setlej to
the Indus.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[189:57](vp061.htm#fr_533) These are included
amongst the northern nations; Váyu, &c.; but in Nakula's Dig-vijaya they
are in the west.

<span id="fn_534"></span>[189:58](vp061.htm#fr_534) The Ábhíras,
according to the Puráńas, are also in the north: in the Rámáyańa and
Mahábh. Sabhá P. they are in the west. The fact seems to be, that the
people along the Indus, from Surat to the Himálaya, are often regarded
as either western or northern nations, according to the topographical
position of the writer: in either case the same tribes are intended.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[189:59](vp061.htm#fr_535) The MSS. read
Kálátoyakas, a people placed by the Puráńas in the north.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[189:60](vp061.htm#fr_536) The Váyu reads
Aparítas, a northern nation. There are Aparytæ in Herodotus, classed
with a people bordering on India, the Gandari. The term in the text
signifies also borderers,' and is probably correct, as opposed to the
following word Parántas; the latter signifying those beyond, and the
former those not beyond the borders. The latter has for Parántas,
Parítas; and the Matsya, Parádas.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[189:61](vp061.htm#fr_537) Also Pahlavas, a
northern or northwestern nation, often mentioned in Hindu writings, in
Manu, the Rámáyańa, the Puráńas, &c. They were not a Hindu people, and
may have been some of the tribes between India and Persia.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[189:62](vp061.htm#fr_538) Also
Charmakháńd́ikas, but the sense is the same; those living in the district
Mańd́ala or Khańd́a of Charma: they are a northern people: Váyu, &c. Pliny
mentions a king of a people so called, "Charmarum rex."

<span id="fn_539"></span>[189:63](vp061.htm#fr_539) Read Marubhaumas;
more satisfactorily, as it means the inhabitants of Marubhúmí, 'the
desert;' the sands of Sindh.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[189:64](vp061.htm#fr_540) Also Surásht́ras,
which is no doubt more correct; the inhabitants of Surat.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[189:65](vp061.htm#fr_541) The Kekayas or
Kaikeyas appear amongst the chief nations in the war of the Mahábhárata,
their king being a kinsman of Krishńa. The Rámáyańa, II. 53, specifies
their position beyond, or west of, the Vipáśa.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[190:66](vp061.htm#fr_542) We have in the
Puráńas Kut́t́apracharańas and Kut́t́aprávarańas amongst the mountain
tribes.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[190:67](vp061.htm#fr_543) These may be people
upon the Mahí river: they are named amongst the southern nations by the
Váyu, &c., but the west is evidently intended.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[190:68](vp061.htm#fr_544) Read also Kachchas:
the Puráńa have Kachchiyas. The form is equally applicable to people
dwelling in districts contiguous to water and in marshy spots, and
denotes the province still called Cutch.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[190:69](vp061.htm#fr_545) Also read Adhya,
Antya, and Andhra: the latter is the name of Telingana, the Andhri of
Pliny.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[190:70](vp061.htm#fr_546) Three MSS. have
Malada, a people of the east in Bhíma's Dig-vijaya.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[190:71](vp061.htm#fr_547) Also Mánavalakas.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[190:72](vp061.htm#fr_548) A people of the
east.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[190:73](vp061.htm#fr_549) The western
provinces of Bengal, or, as sometimes used in a more comprehensive
sense, it includes the following districts: Rajshahi, Dinajpur, and
Rangpur; Nadiya, Birbhum, Burdwan, part of Midnapur, and the Jungle
Mahals; Ramgerh, Pachete, Palamow, and part of Chunar. See an account of
Puńd́ra, translated from what is said to be part of the Brahmańd́a section
of the Bhavishyat Puráńa. Calcutta Quart. Mag. Dec. 1824.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[190:74](vp061.htm#fr_550) There is
considerable variety in this term, Lárga, Márja, Samuttara, and
Samantara; probably neither is correct. Bhargas are amongst the people
subdued in the east by Bhíma.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[190:75](vp061.htm#fr_551) These are foresters
and barbarians in general.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[190:76](vp061.htm#fr_552) Notwithstanding the
celebrity of this country, as the kingdom of Nala, it does not appear
exactly where it was situated: we may conclude it was not far from
Vidharba (Berar) as that was the country of Damayantí. From the
directions given by Nala to Damayantí, it is near the Vindhya mountain
and Payoshńí river, and roads lead from it across the Riksha mountain to
Avanti and the south, as well as to Vidarbha and to Kośalá.
Nalopákhyána, sec. 9.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[190:77](vp061.htm#fr_553) These are always
placed in the west: they are fabled to be the descendants of Ánartta,
the son of Saryáti, who founded the capital Kuśasthalí afterwards
Dwáraká, on the sea-shore in Guzerat.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[190:78](vp061.htm#fr_554) Also Pratimatsyas;
those opposite or adjacent to the Matsyas.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[190:79](vp061.htm#fr_555) Also Kuśajas and
Kośalas; the latter is probably correct, as the name does not occur in
any other form than that of Kasikośalá above. Kośalá is a name variously
applied. Its earliest and most celebrated application is to the country
on the banks of the Sar.ayú, the kingdom of Ráma, of which Ayodhyá was
the capital. Rámáyańa, I. s. 5. In the Mahábhárata we <span
id="page_191">p. 191</span> have one Kośalá in the east, and another in
the south, besides the Prak-kośalas and Uttara-kośalas in the east and
north, The Puráńas place the Kośalas amongst the people or the back of
Vindhya;' and it would appear from the Váyu that Kuśa, the son of Ráma,
transferred his kingdom to a more central position; he ruled over Kośalá
at his capital of Kuśasthalí or Kuśávatí, built upon the Vindhyan
precipices: the same is alluded to in the Pátála Khańd́a of the Padma
Puráńa, and in the Raghu Vanśa, for the purpose of explaining the return
of Kuśa to Ayodhyá. Certainly in later times the country of Kośalá lay
south of Oude, for in the Ratnávalí the general of Vatsa surrounds the
king of Kośalá in the Vindhya mountains: (Hindu Theatre, II. 305:) and,
as noticed in the same work, (p. 267,) we have in the Puráńas, Sapta
Kośalas, or seven Kośalas. An inscription found at Ratnapur in
Chattisgarh, of which I have an unpublished translation, states that
Sri-deva, the governor of Malahari Mandala, having obtained the favour
of Prithwideva, king of Kośalá, was enabled to build temples, and dig
tanks, &c., indicating the extension of the power of Kośalá across the
Ganges in that direction. The inscription is dated Samvat 915, or A. D.
858. The Kośalá of the Puráńas and of the dramatic and poetic writers
was however more to the west, along a part of the Vindhya range. Ptolemy
has a Kontakossula in the south, probably one of the Kośalas of the
Hindus.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[191:80](vp061.htm#fr_556) Also Itíkas; perhaps
the Ishíkas or Aishíkas of the Váyu, &c. a people of the south.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[191:81](vp061.htm#fr_557) The people of
Kashmir.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[191:82](vp061.htm#fr_558) One of the chief
tribes engaged in the war of the Mahábhárata. The Rámáyańa places them
in the west; the Puráńas in the north. The term Sindhu shews their
position to have been upon the Indus, apparently in the Punjab.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[191:83](vp061.htm#fr_559) These are also a
people of the northwest, found both on the west of the Indus and in the
Punjab, and well known to classical authors as the Gandarii and
Gandaridæ. As. Res. XV. 103; also Journal of the R. As. Soc.; Account of
the Foe-küe-ki.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[191:84](vp061.htm#fr_560) From the context
this should probably be Darvakas, the people of a district usually
specified in connexion with the succeeding.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[191:85](vp061.htm#fr_561) These are the
inhabitants of the country bordering on Cashmir, to the south and west;
known to the Greeks as the kingdom of Abisares. It often occurs in
composition with Darya, as Darvábhisára. As. Res. XV. 24.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[191:86](vp061.htm#fr_562) Also read Ulút́as and
Kulút́as: the Rámáyańa has Kolúkas or Kaulút́as amongst the western
tribes.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[191:87](vp061.htm#fr_563) Also with the short
vowel, Śaivalas.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[191:88](vp061.htm#fr_564) The Váhlíkas or
Báhlíkas are always associated with the people of the north, west, and
ultra-Indian provinces, and are usually considered to represent the
Bactrians, or people of Balkh. It is specified in the Mahábh. Udyoga P.
as famous for its horses, a reputation the country bordering upon it, at
least Bokhara and Maimena, still preserves: and in Arjuńa's Dig-vijaya
it is said to be difficult of approach.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[191:89](vp061.htm#fr_565) These are probably
intended for the <span id="page_192">p. 192</span> neighbours of the
Abhisáras: they are found in the north by Arjuna, Dig-vijaya, and are
there termed also Kshatriyas.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[192:90](vp061.htm#fr_566) Also read Báhubádhya
and Bahurada.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[192:91](vp061.htm#fr_567) The name occurs in
the Rámáyańa as that of a mountain in the Punjab or in the Báhíka
country. II. 53.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[192:92](vp061.htm#fr_568) The MSS. agree in
reading this Vánáyava or Vanayus, a people in the northwest, also famous
for horses.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[192:93](vp061.htm#fr_569) A better reading is
Dasapárśwa, as we have had Daśárńas before.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[192:94](vp061.htm#fr_570) Also Ropáńas; quere,
Romans?

<span id="fn_571"></span>[192:95](vp061.htm#fr_571) Also Gachchas and
Kachchas: the last is the best reading, although it has occurred before.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[192:96](vp061.htm#fr_572) Also
Gopála-kachchas: they are amongst the eastern tribes in Bhíma's

<span id="fn_574"></span>[192:98](vp061.htm#fr_574) Kurujángalas, or the
people of the forests in the upper part of the Doab: it is also read
Paravallabhas.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[192:99](vp061.htm#fr_575) The analogy to
'barbarians' is not in sound only, but in all the authorities these are
classed with borderers and foreigners and nations not Hindu.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[192:100](vp061.htm#fr_576) Also Dáhas, in
which we should have a resemblance to the Scythian Dahæ.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[192:101](vp061.htm#fr_577) Or Támaliptas or
Dámaliptas; the people at the western mouth of the Ganges in Medinipur

Malabar proper.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[192:106](vp061.htm#fr_582) Also Prásyas.
Práchyas properly means the people of the east, the Prasii of the
Greeks, east of the Ganges.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[192:107](vp061.htm#fr_583) Múshika is the
southernmost part of the Malabar coast, Cochin and Travancore.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[192:111](vp061.htm#fr_587) Also Vikalpas.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[192:112](vp061.htm#fr_588) Also Pushkalas,

<span id="fn_591"></span>[193:115](vp061.htm#fr_591) Variously read
Nalakálaka, Nabhakánana, and Tilakanija.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[193:116](vp061.htm#fr_592) Kaukundaka and
Kaukuntaka.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[193:117](vp061.htm#fr_593) The inhabitants of
the lower part of the Coromandel coast; so called after them
Chola-mańd́ala.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[193:118](vp061.htm#fr_594) People of the
Konkan: according to some statements there are seven districts so named.

<span id="fn_595"></span>[193:119](vp061.htm#fr_595) Malavanara and
Śálaváńaka.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[193:120](vp061.htm#fr_596) These two words are
sometimes compounded as Kukkurángára: it is also read Kanurájada.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[193:121](vp061.htm#fr_597) This is a
questionable name, though the MSS. agree. We have in Arjuna's
Dig-vijaya, Utsavamanketa; and in Nakula's, to the west, Utsavasanketa.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[193:122](vp061.htm#fr_598) These are amongst
the warriors of the Mahábhárata; they are included in all the lists
amongst the northern tribes, and are mentioned in the Rájátaranginí as
not far from Kashmir: they are considered to be the people of Lahone.

<span id="fn_599"></span>[193:123](vp061.htm#fr_599) Also Vyúkas and
Vrikas: the latter are specified amongst the central nations: Váyu, &c.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[193:124](vp061.htm#fr_600) Kokavakas and
Kokanakhas.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[193:125](vp061.htm#fr_601) Śáras and
Vegasaras; also Parasanchárakas.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[193:126](vp061.htm#fr_602) Vindhyapálakas and
Vindhyamúlikas: the latter, those at the foot of Vindhya, are named in
the Pauráńik lists amongst the southern tribes.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[193:127](vp061.htm#fr_603) Balwala and
Valkaja.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[193:128](vp061.htm#fr_604) Also Málaka and
Májava.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[193:129](vp061.htm#fr_605) Also Vallabhas,
which from the succeeding word may be conjectured to be correct. A city
named Vallabhí makes a great figure in the traditions of Rajputana. See
Tod's Rajasthan.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[193:130](vp061.htm#fr_606) One of the tribes
in the west or north-west subdued by Arjuna.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[193:131](vp061.htm#fr_607) Kálada and Dohada.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[193:132](vp061.htm#fr_608) Kundala, Karantha,
and Mańd́aka: the latter occurs in the Rámáyańa amongst the eastern
nations.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[193:134](vp061.htm#fr_610) Stanabála.

Náríya.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[193:136](vp061.htm#fr_612) The Śrinjayas are a
people from the north-west amongst the warriors of the Mahábhárata: the
reading may be incorrect. It occurs also Putísrinjaya.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[193:137](vp061.htm#fr_613) Also Aninda.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[193:138](vp061.htm#fr_614) Also Sivata,
Sirála, Syuvaka.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[193:139](vp061.htm#fr_615) Tanapa, Stanapa,
Sutapa.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[193:140](vp061.htm#fr_616) Pallipanjaka and
Vidarbha.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[193:141](vp061.htm#fr_617) Dadhividarbha, but
three copies have Rishika. Great variety, and no doubt great inaccuracy,
prevails in the MSS. in several of the names \]sere given: they are not
found elsewhere.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[193:142](vp061.htm#fr_618) The reading of
three copies is Kákas: there is a tribe so called on the banks of the
Indus, as it leaves the mountains.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[193:143](vp061.htm#fr_619) These and the
following are mountaineers <span id="page_194">p. 194</span> in the
north-west. The former are placed by the Puráńas in the north, and the
Váyu includes them also amongst the mountain tribes. The Rámáyańa has
Tankanas in the north.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[194:144](vp061.htm#fr_620) The term Yavanas,
although in later times applied to the Mohammedans, designated formerly
the Greeks, as observed in the valuable notes on the translation of the
Birth of Umá, from the Kumára Sambhava. (Journal As. Soc. of Bengal,
July 1833.) The Greeks were known throughout western Asia by the term ‏ו
יון‎, Yavan; or Ion, Ἰαονες; the Yavana, \#\#\#, of the Hindus; or as it
occurs in its Prakrit form, in the very curious inscription decyphered
by Mr. Prinsep, (J. As. Soc. Beng. Feb. 1838,) Yona: the term Yona Rájá
being there associated with the name Antiochus, in all likelihood
Antiochus the Great, the ally of the Indian prince Sophagasenas, about
B. C. 210. That the Macedonian or Bactrian Greeks were most usually
intended is not only probable from their position and relations with
India, but from their being usually named in concurrence with the
north-western tribes, Kambojas, Daradas, Páradas, Báhlikas, Śakas, &c.
in the Rámáyańa, Mahábhárata, Puráńas, Manu, and in various poems and
plays.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[194:145](vp061.htm#fr_621) Chinas, or Chinese,
or rather the people of Chinese Tartary, are named in the Rámáyańa and
Manu, as well as in the Puráńas. If the designation China was derived
from the Tsin dynasty, which commenced B. C. 260, this forms a limit of
antiquity for the works in question. The same word however, or Tsin, was
the ancient appellation of the northern province of Shen-sy, and it may
have reached the Hindus from thence at an earlier period.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[194:146](vp061.htm#fr_622) These Wilford
regards as the people of Arachosia. They are always mentioned together
with the north-western tribes, Yavanas, Śakas, and the like: they are
also famous for their hoses; and in the Rámáyańa they are said to be
covered with golden lotuses. What is meant is doubtful, probably some
ornament or embellishment of their dress. We have part of the name, or
Kambi, in the Cambistholi of Arrian: the last two syllables, no doubt,
represent the Sanscrit Sthala, 'place,' 'district;' and the word denotes
the dwellers in the Kamba or Kambis country: so Kámboja may be explained
those born in Kamba or Kambas.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[194:147](vp061.htm#fr_623) Also Śakridvaha or
Śakridguha.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[194:148](vp061.htm#fr_624) Also Kulachchas and
Kuntalas: the Puráńas have Kupathas amongst the mountain tribes.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[194:149](vp061.htm#fr_625) Also Párataka: the
first is not a common form in the Puráńas, although it is in poetical
writings, denoting, no doubt, the Persians, or people of Pars or Fars:
the latter, also read Páradas, may imply the same, as beyond (Pára) the
Indus.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[194:150](vp061.htm#fr_626) We have Ramathas in
Nakula's Dig-vijaya, and in the Váyu and Matsya.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[194:151](vp061.htm#fr_627) Daśamánas and
Deśamánikas, in the north: Váyu and Matsya.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[194:152](vp061.htm#fr_628) The passage occurs
in the Váyu and Márkańd́eya Puráńas, as well as in the Mahábhárata; but
the purport is not very distinct, and the proper reading is doubtful.
<span id="page_195">p. 195</span> In three MSS. of the latter it occurs
\#\#\# the latter páda is the same in all: the former, is \#\#\# in a
fourth copy, in two copies of the Váyu it is \#\#\#. None of these are
intelligible, and the Márkańd́eya furnishes the reading followed, Modern
geographers have supposed the Cathæi, Cathari, and Chatriæi of the
ancients, in the lower parts of the Punjab, to mean a people of
Kshatriyas; but no such people occur directly named in our lists.
Considering that the text is speaking of barbarous and foreign tribes,
perhaps no particular nation is here meant, and it may be intended as an
epithet of those which follow, or of Vaiśya (agricultural) and Śúdra
(servile or low) tribes, living either near to, or after the manner of
Kshatriyas: in that case a better reading would be, \#\#\#. According to
Manu, various northern tribes, the Śakas, Kámbojas, Páradas, Pahlavas,
Kirátas, Daradas, and Khasas, and even the Chinas and Yavanas, are
degraded Kshatriyas, in consequence of neglecting religious rites. X.
43, 44. According to the Pauráńik legend they were overcome in war by
Sagara, and degraded from their original caste. See book IV.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[195:153](vp061.htm#fr_629) Here we have a
people called Śúdras by all the authorities, and placed in the west or
north-west, towards the Indus. They have been ingeniously, and with
probability, conjectured by Mr. Lassen to be the Oxydracæ; for Śúdraka
is equally correct with Śúdra; and in place of Ὀξυδράκαι various MSS. of
Strabo, as quoted by Siebenkees, read Σιδράκαι and Συδράκαι: the latter
is precisely the Sanscrit appellation. Pliny also has Sudraci for the
people who formed the limit of Alexander's eastern conquests, or those
hitherto inaccurately called Oxydracæ.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[195:154](vp061.htm#fr_630) These are always
conjoined with the Śúdras, as if conterminous. Their situation is no
doubt correctly indicated by Ptolemy by the position of Abiria above
Pattalene on the Indus.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[195:155](vp061.htm#fr_631) The Durds are still
where they were at the date of our text, and in the days of Strabo and
Ptolemy; not exactly, indeed, at the sources of the Indus, but along its
course, above the Himálaya, just before it descends to India; a position
which might well be taken for its head.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[195:156](vp061.htm#fr_632) Also read Paśus,
'brutes.' If the term might be altered to Palli, it would imply 'village
or pastoral tribes.'

<span id="fn_633"></span>[195:157](vp061.htm#fr_633) Also Khasíkas and
Khasákas. The first of these is probably most correct, being equivalent
to Khasas, barbarians named along with the Śakas and Daradas by Manu,
&c.; traces of whom may be sought amongst the barbarous tribes on the
north-east of Bengal, the Kasiyas; or it has been thought that they may
be referred to the situation of Kashgar. Two copies have, in place of
this, Tukháras, and the same occurs in the Rámáyańa; the Váyu has
Tusháras, but the Márkańd́eya, Tukhára: these are probably the Tochari,
Tachari, or Thogari, a tribe of the Śakas, by whom Bactria was taken
from the Greeks, and from whom Tocharestan derives the name it still
bears.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[195:158](vp061.htm#fr_634) Also Pahlavas and
Pallavas. The form in the text is the more usual.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[196:159](vp061.htm#fr_635) The Rámáyańa has
Gahvaras. The mountains from Kabul to Bamian furnish infinitely numerous
instances of cavern habitations.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[196:160](vp061.htm#fr_636) These two,
according to the Váyu, are amongst the northern nations; but they might
be thought to be religious fraternities, from the sages Atri and
Bharadwaja.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[196:161](vp061.htm#fr_637) The latter member
of the compound occurs poshikas, páyikas, and yodhikas, 'cherishers,'
'drinkers,' or 'fighters:' the first term denotes the female breast.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[196:162](vp061.htm#fr_638) Also Drońakas,
'people of vallies.'

<span id="fn_639"></span>[196:163](vp061.htm#fr_639) Also Kajingas.
Kalingas would be here out of place.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[196:164](vp061.htm#fr_640) These and the
preceding are included by the Váyu amongst the mountain tribes of the
north.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[196:165](vp061.htm#fr_641) Many names indeed
might be added to the catalogue from the lists referred to in the Váyu,
Matsya, and Márkańd́eya Puráńas, as well as several capable of
verification from the Rámáyańa, and other passages of the Mahábhárata.
This is not the place however to exhaust the subject, and it has been
prosecuted too far perhaps already. It is evident that a very
considerable proportion of the names recorded can be verified, and that
many of them may be traced in the geographical notices of India left by
the historians of Alexander's expedition. That more cannot be identified
is owing in a great measure to incomplete research; and a more extensive
examination of the authorities would no doubt discover passages where
circumstances, as well as names, are given by which the places would be
recognised. It is evident, however, that much embarrassment also arises
from the inaccuracy of manuscripts, which vary widely and
irreconcilably. I have given instances from four different copies of the
text; one in my own possession, three in the library of the East India
Company; all very excellent copies, but manifestly erroneous in many
respects in their nomenclature of places, and particularly of those
which are least known. No assistance is to be had from any commentary,
as the subject is one of little interest in native estimation.
