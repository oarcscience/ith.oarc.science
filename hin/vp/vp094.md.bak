### CHAP. II.

Dispersion of Revata's descendants: those of Dhrisht́a: those of Nábhága.
Birth of Ikshwáku, the son of Vaivaswata: his sons. Line of Vikukshi.
Legend of Kakutstha; of Dhundhumára; of Yuvanáśwa; of Mándhátri: his
daughters married to Saubhari.

PARÁŚARA.--Whilst Kakudmin, surnamed Raivata, was absent on his visit to
the region of Brahmá, the evil spirits or Rákshasas named Puńyajanas
destroyed his capital Kuśasthalí. His hundred brothers, through dread of
these foes, fled in different directions; and the Kshatriyas, their
descendants, settled in many countries <span
id="fr_949"></span>[1](#fn_949.md).

From Dhrisht́a, the son of the Manu, sprang the Kshatriya race of
Dhársht́aka <span id="fr_950"></span>[2](#fn_950.md).

The son of Nabhága was Nábhága <span id="fr_951"></span>[3](#fn_951.md);
his son was

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ambarísha <span
id="fr_952"></span>[4](#fn_952.md); his son was Virúpa <span
id="fr_953"></span>[5](#fn_953.md); his son was Prishadaśwa; his son was
Rathínara, of whom it is sung, "These, who were Kshatriyas by birth, the
heads of the family of Rathínara, were called Ángirasas (or sons of
Angiras), and were Brahmans as well as Kshatriyas <span
id="fr_954"></span>[6](#fn_954.md)."

Ikshwáku was born from the nostril of the Manu, as he happened to
sneeze <span id="fr_955"></span>[7](#fn_955.md). He had a hundred sons, of
whom the three most distinguished were Vikukshi, Nimi, and Dańd́a. Fifty
of the rest, under Sakuni, were the protectors of the northern
countries. Forty-eight were the princes of the south <span
id="fr_956"></span>[8](#fn_956.md).

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

Upon one of the days called Asht́aka <span
id="fr_957"></span>[9](#fn_957.md), Ikshwáku being desirous of celebrating
ancestral obsequies, ordered Vikukshi to bring him flesh suitable for
the offering. The prince accordingly went into the forest, and killed
many deer, and other wild animals, for the celebration. Being weary with
the chase, and being hungered, he sat down, and ate a hare; after which,
being refreshed, he carried the rest of the game to his father.
Vaśisht́ha, the family priest of the house of Ikshwáku, was summoned to
consecrate the food; but he declared that it was impure, in consequence
of Vikukshi's having eaten a hare from amongst it (making it thus, as it
were, the residue of his meal). Vikukshi was in consequence abandoned by
his offended father, and the epithet Śaśáda (hare-eater) was affixed to
him by the Guru. On the death of Ikshwáku, the dominion of the earth
descended to Śaśáda <span id="fr_958"></span>[10](#fn_958.md), who was
succeeded by his son Puranjaya.

In the Treta age a violent war <span id="fr_959"></span>[11](#fn_959.md)
broke out between the gods and the Asuras, in which the former were
vanquished. They consequently had recourse to Vishńu for assistance, and
propitiated him by their adorations. The eternal ruler of the universe,
Náráyańa, had compassion upon them, and said, "What you desire is known
unto me. Hear how your wishes shall be fulfilled. There is an
illustrious prince named Puranjaya, the son of a royal sage; into his
person I will infuse a portion of myself, and having descended upon
earth I will in his person subdue all your enemies. Do you therefore
endeavour to secure the aid

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

of Puranjaya for the destruction of your foes." Acknowledging with
reverence the kindness of the deity, the immortals quitted his presence,
and repaired to Puranjaya, whom they thus addressed: "Most renowned
Kshatriya, we have come to thee to solicit thy alliance against our
enemies: it will not become thee to disappoint our hopes." The prince
replied, "Let this your Indra, the monarch of the spheres, the god of a
hundred sacrifices, consent to carry me upon his shoulders, and I will
wage battle with your adversaries as your ally." The gods and Indra
readily answered, "So be it;" and the latter assuming the shape of a
bull, the prince mounted upon his shoulder. Being then filled with
delight, and invigorated by the power of the eternal ruler of all
movable and immovable things, he destroyed in the battle that ensued all
the enemies of the gods; and because he annihilated the demon host
whilst seated upon the shoulder (or the hump, Kakud) of the bull, he
thence obtained the appellation Kakutstha (seated on the hump <span
id="fr_960"></span>[12](#fn_960).md).

The son of Kakutstha was Anenas <span id="fr_961"></span>[13](#fn_961.md),
whose son was Prithu, whose son was Viswagaśwa <span
id="fr_962"></span>[14](#fn_962.md), whose son was Árdra <span
id="fr_963"></span>[15](#fn_963.md), whose son was Yuvanáśwa, whose son was
Śravasta, by whom the city of Śrávastí <span
id="fr_964"></span>[16](#fn_964.md) was founded. The son of Śravasta was
Vrihadaśwa, whose son was Kuvalayáśwa. This prince, inspired with the
spirit of Vishńu, destroyed the Asura Dhundhu, who had harassed the
pious sage Uttanka; and he was thence entitled Dhundhumára <span
id="fr_965"></span>[17](#fn_965.md). In his conflict with the demon

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

the king was attended by his sons, to the number of twenty-one thousand;
and all these, with the exception of only three, perished in the
engagement, consumed by the fiery breath of Dhundhu. The three who
survived were Drídháśwa, Chandráśwa, and Kapiláśwa; and the son and
successor of the elder of these was Haryyáśwa; his son was Nikumbha; his
son was Sanhatáśwa; his son was Kriśáśwa; his son was Prasenajit; and
his son was another Yuvanáśwa <span id="fr_966"></span>[18](#fn_966.md).

Yuvanáśwa had no son, at which he was deeply grieved. Whilst residing in
the vicinage of the holy Munis, he inspired them with pity for his
childless condition, and they instituted a religious rite to procure him
progeny. One night during its performance the sages having

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

placed a vessel of consecrated water upon the altar had retired to
repose. It was past midnight, when the king awoke, exceedingly thirsty;
and unwilling to disturb any of the holy inmates of the dwelling, he
looked about for something to drink. In his search he came to the water
in the jar, which had been sanctified and endowed with prolific efficacy
by sacred texts, and he drank it. When the Munis rose, and found that
the water had been drunk, they inquired who had taken it, and said, "The
queen that has drunk this water shall give birth to a mighty and valiant
son." "It was I," exclaimed the Rájá, "who unwittingly drank the water!"
and accordingly in the belly of Yuvanáśwa was conceived a child, and it
grew, and in due time it ripped open the right side of the Rájá, and was
born, and the Raji, did not die. Upon the birth of the child, "Who will
be its nurse?" said the Munis; when, Indra, the king of the gods,
appeared, and said, "He shall have me for his nurse" (mám dhásyati); and
hence the boy was named Mándhátri. Indra put his fore finger into the
mouth of the infant, who sucked it, and drew from it heavenly nectar;
and he grew up, and became a mighty monarch, and reduced the seven
continental zones under his dominion. And here a verse is recited; "From
the rising to the going down of the sun, all that is irradiated by his
light, is the land of Mándhátri, the son of Yuvanáśwa <span
id="fr_967"></span>[19](#fn_967.md)."

Mándhátri married Vindumatí, the daughter of Śaśavindu, and had by her
three sons, Purukutsa, Ambarísha, and Muchukunda; he had also fifty
daughters <span id="fr_968"></span>[20](#fn_968.md).

The devout sage Saubhari, learned in the Vedas, had spent twelve years
immersed in a piece of water; the sovereign of the fish in which, named
Sammada, of large bulk, had a very numerous progeny. His children and
his grandchildren were wont to frolic around him in all

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

directions, and he lived amongst them happily, playing with them night
and day. Saubhari the sage, being disturbed in his devotions by their
sports, contemplated the patriarchal felicity of the monarch of the
lake, and reflected, "How enviable is this creature, who, although horn
in a degraded state of being, is ever thus sporting cheerfully amongst
his offspring and their young. Of a truth he awakens in my mind the wish
to taste such pleasure, and I also will make merry amidst my children."
Having thus resolved, the Muni came up hastily from the water, and,
desirous of entering upon the condition of a householder, went to
Mándhátri to demand one of his daughters as his wife. As soon as he was
informed of the arrival of the sage, the king rose up from his throne,
offered him the customary libation, and treated him with the most
profound respect. Having taken a seat, Saubhari said to the Rájá, "I
have determined to marry: do you, king, give me one of your daughters as
a wife: disappoint not my affection. It is not the practice of the
princes of the race of Kakutstha to turn away from compliance with the
wishes of those who come to them for succour. There are, O monarch,
other kings of the earth to whom daughters have been born, but your
family is above all renowned for observance. of liberality in your
donations to those who ask your bounty. You have, O prince, fifty
daughters; give one of them to me, that so I may be relieved from the
anxiety I suffer through fear that my suit may be denied."

When Mándhátri heard this request, and looked upon the person of the
sage, emaciated by austerity and old age, he felt disposed to refuse his
consent; but dreading to incur the anger and imprecation of the holy
man, he was much perplexed, and, declining his head, was lost a while in
thought. The Rishi, observing his hesitation, said, "On what, O Rájá, do
you meditate? I have asked for nothing which may not be readily
accorded: and what is there that shall he unattainable to you, if my
desires be gratified by the damsel whom you must needs give unto me?" To
this, the king, apprehensive of his displeasure, answered and said,
"Grave sir, it is the established usage of our house to wed our
daughters to such persons only as they shall themselves select from
suitors of fitting rank; and since this your request is not yet made
known to my

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

maidens, it is impossible to say whether it may be equally agreeable to
them as it is to me. This is the occasion of my perplexity, and I am at
a loss what to do." This answer of the king was fully understood by the
Rishi, who said to himself, "This is merely a device of the Rájá to
evade compliance with my suit: the has reflected that I am an old man,
having no attractions for women, and not likely to be accepted by any of
his daughters: even be it so; I will be a match for him:" and he then
spake aloud, and said, "Since such is the custom, mighty prince, give
orders that I be admitted into the interior of the palace. Should any of
the maidens your daughters be willing to take me for a bridegroom, I
will have her for my bride; if no one be willing, then let the blame
attach alone to the years that I have numbered." Having thus spoken, he
was silent.

Mándhátri, unwilling to provoke the indignation of the Muni, was
accordingly obliged to command the eunuch to lead the sage into the
inner chambers; who, as he entered the apartments, put on a form and
features of beauty far exceeding the personal charms of mortals, or even
of heavenly spirits. His conductor, addressing the princesses, said to
them, "Your father, young ladies, sends you this pious sage, who has
demanded of him a bride; and the Rája has promised him, that he will not
refuse him any one of you who shall choose him for her husband." When
the damsels heard this, and looked upon the person of the Rishi, they
were equally inspired with passion and desire, and, like a troop of
female elephants disputing the favours of the master of the herd, they
all contended for the choice. "Away, away, sister!" said each to the
other; "this is my election, he is my choice; he is not a meet
bridegroom for you; he has been created by Brahmá on purpose for me, as
I have been created in order to become his wife: he has been chosen by
me before you; you have no right to prevent his becoming my husband." In
this way arose a violent quarrel amongst the daughters of the king, each
insisting upon the exclusive election of the Rishi: and as the blameless
sage was thus contended for by the rival princesses, the superintendent
of the inner apartments, with a downcast look, reported to the king what
had occurred. Perplexed more than ever by this

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

information, the Rájá exclaimed, "What is all this! and what am I to do
now! What is it that I have said!" and at last, although with extreme
reluctance, he was obliged to agree that the Rishi should marry all his
daughters.

Having then wedded, agreeably to law, all the princesses, the sage took
them home to his habitation, where he employed the chief of architects,
Viśwakarman, equal in taste and skill to Brahmá himself, to construct
separate palaces for each of his wives: he ordered him to provide each
building with elegant couches and seats and furniture, and to attach to
them gardens and groves, with reservoirs of water, where the wild-duck
and the swan should sport amidst beds of lotus flowers. The divine
artist obeyed his injunctions, and constructed splendid apartments for
the wives of the Rishi; in which by command of Saubhari, the
inexhaustible and divine treasure called Nanda <span
id="fr_969"></span>[21](#fn_969.md) took up his permanent abode, and the
princesses entertained all their guests and dependants with abundant
viands of every description and the choicest quality.

After some period had elapsed, the heart of king Mándhátri yearned for
his daughters, and he felt solicitous to know whether they were happily
circumstanced. Setting off therefore on a visit to the hermitage of
Saubhari, he beheld upon his arrival a row of beautiful crystal palaces,
shining as brilliantly as the rays of the sun, and situated amidst
lovely gardens, and reservoirs of pellucid water. Entering into one of
these magnificent palaces, he found and embraced a daughter, and said to
her, as the tears of affection and delight trembled in his eyes, "Dear
child, tell me how it is with you. Are you happy here? or not? Does the
great sage treat you with tenderness? or do you revert with regret to
your early home?" The princess replied, "You behold, my father, how
delightful a mansion I inhabit, surrounded by lovely gardens and lakes,
where the lotus blooms, and the wild swans murmur. Here I have delicious
viands, fragrant unguents, costly ornaments, splendid raiment, soft
beds, and every enjoyment that affluence can procure. Why then should I
call to memory the place of my birth? To your favour am I

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

indebted for all that I possess. I have only one cause of anxiety, which
is this; my husband is never absent from my dwelling: solely attached to
me, he is always at my side; he never goes near my sisters; and I am
concerned to think that they must feel mortified by his neglect: this is
the only circumstance that gives me uneasiness."

Proceeding to visit another of his daughters, the king, after embracing
her, and sitting down, made the same inquiry, and received the same
account of the enjoyments with which the princess was provided: there
was also the same complaint, that the Rishi was wholly devoted to her,
and paid no attention to her sisters. In every palace Mándhátri heard
the same story from each of his daughters in reply to his questions; and
with a heart overflowing with wonder and delight he repaired to the wise
Saubhari, whom he found alone, and, after paying homage to him, thus
addressed him: "Holy sage, I have witnessed this thy marvellous power;
the like miraculous faculties I have never known any other to possess.
How great is the reward of thy devout austerities!" Having thus saluted
the sage, and been received by him with respect, the Rájá resided with
him for some time, partaking of the pleasures of the place, and then
returned to his capital.

In the course of time the daughters of Mándhátri bore to Saubhari a
hundred and fifty sons, and day by day his affection for his children
became more intense, and his heart was wholly occupied, with the
sentiment of self <span id="fr_970"></span>[22](#fn_970.md). "These my
sons," he loved to think, "will charm me with their infant prattle; then
they will learn to walk; they will then grow up to youth and to manhood:
I shall see them married, and they will have children; and I may behold
the children of those children." By these and similar reflections,
however, he perceived that his anticipations every day outstripped the
course of time, and at last he exclaimed, "What exceeding folly is mine!
there is no end to my desires. Though all I hope should come to pass for
ten thousand or a hundred thousand years, still new wishes would spring
up. When I have seen my infants walk; when I have beheld their youth,
their manhood, their marriage, their progeny; still my expectations are
unsatisfied,

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

and my soul yearns to behold the descendants of their descendants. Shall
I even see them, some other wish will be engendered; and when that is
accomplished, how is the birth of fresh desires to he prevented? I have
at last discovered that there is no end to hope, until it terminates in
death; and that the mind which is perpetually engrossed by expectation,
can never be attached to the supreme spirit. My mental devotions, whilst
immersed in water, were interrupted by attachment to my friend the fish.
The result of that connexion was my marriage; and insatiable desires are
the consequences of my married life. The pain attendant upon the birth
of my single body, is now augmented by the cares attached to fifty
others, and is farther multiplied by the numerous children whom the
princesses have borne to me. The sources of affliction will be
repeatedly renewed by their children, and by their espousals, and by
their progeny, and will be infinitely increased: a married life is a
mine of individual anxiety. My devotions, first disturbed by the fish of
the pool, have since been obstructed by temporal indulgence, and I have
been beguiled by that desire for progeny which was communicated to me by
association with Sammada. Separation from the world is the only path of
the sage to final liberation: from commerce with mankind innumerable
errors proceed. The ascetic who has accomplished a course of self-denial
falls from perfection by contracting worldly attachments: how much more
likely should one so fall whose observances are incomplete? My intellect
has been a prey to the desire of married happiness; but I will now so
exert myself for the salvation of my soul, that, exempt from human
imperfections, I may be exonerated from human sufferings. To that end I
will propitiate, by arduous penance, Vishńu, the creator of the
universe, whose form is inscrutable, who is smaller than the smallest,
larger than the largest, the source of darkness and of light, the
sovereign god of gods. On his everlasting body, which is both discrete
and indiscrete substance, illimitably mighty, and identical with the
universe, may my mind, wholly free from sin, be ever steadily intent, so
that I may be born no more. To him I fly for refuge; to that Vishńu, who
is the teacher of teachers, who is one with all beings, the pure eternal
lord of all, without beginning, middle, or end, and besides whom is
nothing."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_949"></span>[358:1](vp094.htm#fr_949.md) According to the
Váyu, the brothers of Raivata founded a celebrated race called Śáryáta,
from Śaryáti. The Bráhma P. says they took refuge in secret places
(gahana); for which the Hari Vanśa substitutes (parvata gańa) mountains.
The Váyu has neither, and says merely that they were renowned in all
regions.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[358:2](vp094.htm#fr_950.md) So the Váyu, Linga,
Agni, Bráhma, and Hari Vanśa. The Matsya names three sons of Dhrisht́a,
Dhrisht́aketu, Chitranátha, and Rańadhrisht́a. The Bhágavata adds, that
the sons of Dhrisht́a obtained Brahmanhood upon earth, though born
Kshatriyas.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[358:3](vp094.htm#fr_951.md) But who is Nabhága?
for, as above observed, c. 1. n. 2, the son of the Manu is
Nabhága-nedisht́a, and there is in that case no such person as Nabhága:
on the other hand, if Nabhága and Nedisht́a he distinct names, we have
ten sons of Vaivaswata, as in the Bhágavata. The descendants of
Nedisht́a, through his son Nabhága, have been already specified; and
after all, therefore, we must consider the text as intending a distinct
person by the name Nabhága; and such a name does occur in the lists of
the Agni, Kúrma, Matsya, and Bhágavata, unquestionably distinct from
that with which it is also sometimes compounded. The Bhágavata repeats
the legend of the Aitareya Bráhmańa, with some additions, and says that
Nabhága having protracted his period of study beyond the usual age, his
brothers appropriated his share of the patrimony. On his applying for
his portion, they consigned their father to him, by whose advice he
assisted the descendants of Angiras in a sacrifice, and they presented
him with all the wealth that was left at its termination. Rudra claimed
it as his; and Nabhága acquiescing, the god confirmed the gift, by which
he became possessed of <span id="page_359">p. 359</span> an equivalent
for the loss of territory. Most of the authorities recognise but one
name here, variously read either Nabhága or Nábhága, the father of
Ambarísha. The Váyu, as well as the Bhágavata, concurs with the text.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[359:4](vp094.htm#fr_952.md) The Bhágavata
considers Ambarísha as a king, who reigned apparently on the banks of
the Yamuná. He is more celebrated as a devout worshipper of Vishńu,
whose discus protected him from the wrath of Durvásas, and humbled that
choleric saint, who was a portion of Śiva: a legend which possibly
records a struggle between two sects, in which the votaries of Vishńu,
headed by Ambarísha, triumphed.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[359:5](vp094.htm#fr_953.md) The Agni, Bráhma, and
Matsya stop with Ambarísha. The Váyu and Bhágavata proceed as in the
text, only the latter adds to Virúpa, Ketumat and Śambhu.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[359:6](vp094.htm#fr_954.md) The same verse is
cited in the Váyu, and affords an instance of a mixture of character, of
which several similar cases occur subsequently. Kshatriyas by birth,
become Brahmans by profession; and such persons are usually considered
as Ángirasas, followers or descendants of Angiras, who may have founded
a school of warrior-priests. This is the obvious purport of the legend
of Nabhága's assisting the sons of Angiras to complete their sacrifice,
referred to in a former note, although the same authority has devised a
different explanation. Rathínara (or Rathítara, as read in some copies,
as well as by the Bhágavata and Váyu) being childless, Angiras begot on
his wife sons radiant with divine glory, who as the sons of the monarch
by his wife were Kshatriyas, but were Brahmans through their actual
father. This however is an afterthought, not warranted by the memorial
verse cited in our text.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[359:7](vp094.htm#fr_955.md) So the Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[359:8](vp094.htm#fr_956.md) The Matsya says that
Indra (Devarát́) was born as Vikukshi, and that Ikshwáku had one hundred
and fourteen other sons, who were kings of the countries south of Meru;
and as many who reigned north of that mountain. The Váyu and most of the
other authorities agree in the number of one hundred, of whom fifty,
with Śakuni at their head, are placed in the north; and forty-eight in
the south, according to the Váyu, of whom Vimati was the chief. The same
authority specifies also Nimi and Dańd́a as sons of Ikshwáku, as does the
Bhágavata, with the addition of their reigning in the central regions.
The distribution of the rest in <span id="page_360">p. 360</span> that
work is twenty-five in the west, as many in the east, and the rest
elsewhere; that is, the commentator adds, north and south. It seems very
probable that by these sons of Ikshwáku we are to understand colonies or
settlers in various parts of India.

<span id="fn_957"></span>[360:9](vp094.htm#fr_957.md) See [p.
322](vp088.htm#page_322), [323](vp088.htm#page_323.md).

<span id="fn_958"></span>[360:10](vp094.htm#fr_958.md) The Váyu states that
he was king of Ayodhyá, after the death of Ikshwáku. The story occurs in
all the authorities, more or less in detail.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[360:11](vp094.htm#fr_959.md) The Váyu says it was
in the war of the starling and the stork; a conflict between Vaśisht́ha
and Viswámitra, metamorphosed into birds, according to the Bhágavata;
but that work assigns it to a different period, or the reign of
Hariśchandra. If the tradition have any import, it may refer to the
ensigns of the contending parties; for banners, with armorial devices,
were, as we learn from the Mahábhárata, invariably borne by princes and
leaders.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[361:12](vp094.htm#fr_960.md) The Bhágavata adds,
that he captured the city of the Asuras, situated in the west; whence
his name Puranjaya, 'victor of the city:' he is also termed Paranjaya,
'vanquisher of foes:' he is also called Indraváha, 'borne by Indra.'

<span id="fn_961"></span>[361:13](vp094.htm#fr_961.md) Suyodhana: Matsya,
Agni, Kúrma.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[361:14](vp094.htm#fr_962.md) Viśwaka: Linga.
Viśwagandhi: Bhágav. Visht́aráśwa: Bráhma P. and Hari V.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[361:15](vp094.htm#fr_963.md) Ándhra: Váyu. Áyu:
Agni. Chandra: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[361:16](vp094.htm#fr_964.md) Śávasta and Śávasti:
Bhágav. Śravastí: Matsya, Linga, and Kúrma, which also say that Śravastí
was in the country of Gaura, which is eastern Bengal; but it is more
usually placed in Kośala, by which a part of Oude is commonly
understood. In my Dictionary I have inserted Śrávantí, upon the
authority of the Trikáńd́a Śesha, but it is no doubt an error for
Śrávasti; it is there also called Dharmapattana, being a city of some
sanctity in the estimation of the Buddhists. It is termed by Fa-Hian,
She-wei; by Hwan Tsang, She-lo-va-si-ti; and placed by both nearly in
the site of Fyzabad in Oude. Account of the Foe-kue-ki.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[361:17](vp094.htm#fr_965.md) This legend is told
in much more <span id="page_362">p. 362</span> detail in the Váyu and
Bráhma Puráńas. Dhundhu hid himself beneath a sea of sand, which
Kuvalyáśwa and his sons dug up, undeterred by the flames which checked
their progress, and finally destroyed most of them. The legend
originates probably in the occurrence of some physical phenomenon, as an
earthquake or volcano.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[362:18](vp094.htm#fr_966.md) The series of names
agrees very well to Sanhatáśwa, called Varhańáśwa in the Bhágavata. We
have there some variations, and some details not noticed in our text.
The Váyu, Bráhma, Agni, Linga, Matsya, and Kúrma, ascribe two sons to
Sanhatáśwa, whom the two first name Kriśáśwa and Akriśáśwa, and the rest
Kriśáśwa and Rańáśwa. Senajit or Prasenajit is generally, though not
always, termed the son of the younger brother; but the commentator on
the Hari Vanśa calls him the son of Sanhatáśwa, whilst the Matsya, Agni,
Linga, and Kúrma omit him, and make Mándhátri the son of Rańáśwa. The
mother of Prasenajit and the wife of Akriśáśwa or Sanhatáśwa, according
to the different interpretations, was the daughter of Himavat, known as
Drishadvatí, the river so termed ([p. 181](vp061.htm#page_181.md), n.
[7](vp061.htm#fn_403)..md) The wife of Yuvanáśwa, according to the Váyu, or
of Prasenajit, according to the Bráhma, was Gaurí, the daughter of
Rantínara, who, incurring the imprecation of her husband, became the
Báhudá river ([p. 181](vp061.htm#page_181). n. [6](vp061.htm#fn_402).md).
The Bráhma and Hari Vanśa call Yuvanáśwa her son; but in another place
the Hari Vanśa contradicts itself, calling Gaurí the daughter of
Matímara, of the race of Puru, the mother of Mándhátri; here following
apparently the Matsya, in which it is so stated. The Bráhma P. is not
guilty of the inconsistency. The Váyu of course gives the title to
Mándhátri, with the addition that he was called Gaurika, after his
mother. Mándhátri's birth from Gaurí is the more remarkable, as it is
incompatible with the usual legend given in our text and in the
Bhágavata, which seems therefore to have been of subsequent origin,
suggested by the etymology of the name. In the Bhágavata, Mándhátri is
also named Trasadasyu, or the terrifier of thieves.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[363:19](vp094.htm#fr_967.md) The Váyu cites this
same verse and another, with the remark, that they were uttered by those
acquainted with the Puráńas and with genealogies.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[363:20](vp094.htm#fr_968.md) The Bráhma and Agni
omit Ambarísha, for whom the Matsya substitutes Dharmasena. The
following legend of Saubhari occurs elsewhere only in the Bhágavata, and
there less in detail.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[366:21](vp094.htm#fr_969.md) The great Nidhi: a
Nidhi is a treasure, of which there are several belonging to Kuvera;
each has its guardian spirit, or is personified.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[367:22](vp094.htm#fr_970.md) Of Mamatá,
'mineness;' the notion that wives, children, wealth, belong to an
individual, and are essential to his happiness.
