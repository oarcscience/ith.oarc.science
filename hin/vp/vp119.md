### CHAP. II

The conception of Devakí: her appearance: she is praised by the gods.

THE nurse of the universe, Jagaddhátrí, thus enjoined by the god of
gods, conveyed the six several embryos into the womb of Devakí <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[1](#fn_1464.md), and transferred the seventh after a
season to that of Rohińí; after which, Hari, for the benefit of the
three regions, became incarnate as the conception of the former
princess, and Yoganidrá as that of Yaśodá, exactly as the supreme Vishńu
had commanded. When the portion of Vishńu had become incorporate upon
earth, the planetary bodies moved in brilliant order in the heavens, and
the seasons were regular and genial. No person could bear to gaze upon
Devakí, from the light that invested her; and those who contemplated her
radiance felt their minds disturbed. The gods, invisible to mortals,
celebrated her praises continually from the time that Vishńu was
contained in her person. "Thou," said the divinities, "art that
Prakriti, infinite and subtile, which formerly bore Brahmá in its womb:
then wast thou the goddess of speech, the energy of the creator of the
universe, and the parent of the Vedas. Thou, eternal being, comprising
in thy substance the essence of all created things, wast identical with
creation: thou wast the parent of the triform sacrifice, becoming the
germ of all things: thou art sacrifice, whence all fruit proceeds: thou
art the wood, whose attrition engenders fire. As Adití, thou art the
parent of the gods; as Diti, thou art the mother of the Daityas, their
foes. Thou art light, whence day is begotten: thou art humility, the
mother of true wisdom: thou art kingly policy, the parent of order: thou
art modesty, the progenitrix of affection: thou art desire, of whom love
is born: thou art contentment, whence resignation is derived: thou art
intelligence, the mother of knowledge: thou art patience, the parent of
fortitude: thou art the heavens, and thy children are the stars: and
from thee does all that exists proceed. Such, goddess,

<span id="page_501">p. 501</span>

and thousands more, are thy mighty faculties; and now innumerable are
the contents of thy womb, O mother of the universe. The whole earth,
decorated with oceans, rivers, continents, cities, villages, hamlets,
and towns; all the fires, waters, and winds; the stars, asterisms, and
planets; the sky, crowded with the variegated chariots of the gods, and
ether, that provides space for all substance; the several spheres of
earth, sky, and heaven; of saints, sages, ascetics, and of Brahmá; the
whole egg of Brahmá, with all its population of gods, demons, spirits,
snake-gods, fiends, demons, ghosts, and imps, men and animals, and
whatever creatures have life, comprised in him who is their eternal
lord, and the object of all apprehension; whose real form, nature, name,
and dimensions are not within human apprehension--are now with that
Vishńu in thee. Thou art Swáhá; thou art Swadhá; thou art wisdom,
ambrosia, light, and heaven. Thou hast descended upon earth for the
preservation of the world. Have compassion upon us, O goddess, and do
good unto the world. Be proud to bear that deity by whom the universe is
upheld."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1464"></span>[500:1](vp119.htm#fr_1464.md) It is mentioned in
the preceding chapter that they were all put to death, in which the Hari
Vanśa concurs. The Bhágavata makes Kansa spare them, and restore them to
their parents, as he had nothing to apprehend from their existence.
