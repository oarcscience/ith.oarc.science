### CHAP. XVIII.

Grief of the Gopís on the departure of Krishńa and Balaráma with Akrúra:
their leaving Gokula. Akrúra bathes in the Yamuná; beholds the divine
forms of the two youths, and praises Vishńu.

THUS meditating, the Yádava approached Govinda, and addressed him, and
said, "I am Akrúra," and bowed his head down to the feet of Hari; but
Krishńa laid upon him his hand, which was marked with the flag, the
thunderbolt, and the lotus, and drew him towards him, and affectionately
embraced him. Then Keśava and Ráma entered into conversation with him,
and, having heard from him all that had occurred, were much pleased, and
led him to their habitation: there they resumed their discourse, and
gave him food to eat, and treated him with proper hospitality. Akrúra
told them how their father Ánakadundubhi, the princess Devakí, and even
his own father, Ugrasena, had been insulted by the iniquitous demon
Kansa: he also related to them the purpose for which he had been
dispatched. When he had told them all these things, the destroyer of
Keśin said to him, "I was aware of all that you have told me, lord of
liberal gifts: Ráma and I will go to-morrow to Mathurá along with you.
The elders of the cowherds shall accompany us, bearing ample offerings.
Rest here to-night, and dismiss all anxiety. Within three nights I will
slay Kansa and his adherents."

Having given orders accordingly to the cowherds, Akrúra, with Keśava and
Ráma, retired to rest, and slept soundly in the dwelling of Nanda. The
next morning was bright, and the youths prepared to depart for Mathurá
with Akrúra. The Gopís, seeing them about to set forth, were much
afflicted; they wept bitterly, their bracelets were loose upon their
arms, and they thus communed together: "If Govinda depart for Mathurá,
how will he return to Gokula? his ears will there be regaled with the
melodious and polished conversation of the women of the city. Accustomed
to the language of the graceful females of Mathurá, he will never again
endure the rustic expressions of the Gopís. Hari, the pride of the
station, is carried off, and a fatal blow is inflicted upon us by
inexorable destiny, Expressive smiles, soft language, graceful airs,

<span id="page_545">p. 545</span>

elegant gait, and significant glances, belong to the women of the city.
Hari is of rustic breeding, and, captivated by their fascinations, what
likelihood is there of his returning to the society of any one amongst
us? Keśava, who has mounted the car to go to Mathurá, has been deceived
by the cruel, vile, and desperate Akrúra. Does not the unfeeling traitor
know the affection that we all here feel for our Hari, the joy of our
eyes, that he is taking him away? Unkind that he is, Govinda is
departing from us, along with Ráma: haste! let us stop him! Why talk of
telling our seniors that we cannot bear his loss? What can they do for
us, when we are consumed by the fires of separation? The Gopas, with
Nanda at their head, are themselves preparing to depart; no one makes
any attempt to detain Govinda. Bright is the morning that succeeds to
this night for the women of Mathurá, for the bees of their eyes will
feed upon the lotus face of Achyuta. Happy are they who may go hence
without impediment, and behold, enraptured, Krishńa on his journey. A
great festival will give pleasure to-day to the eyes of the inhabitants
of Mathurá, when they see the person of Govinda. What a blissful vision
will be seen by the happy women, of the city, whose brilliant eyes shall
regard, unchecked, the countenance of Krishńa! Alas! the eyes of the
Gopís have been deprived of sight by the relentless Brahmá, after he had
shewn them this great treasure. In proportion as the affection of Hari
for us decays, so do our limbs wither, and the bracelets slip from our
arms: and now the cruel Akrúra urges on the horses: all conspire to
treat unhappy females with unkindness. Alas! alas! we see now only the
dust of his chariot wheels! and now he is far away, for even that dust
is no longer to be seen!" Thus lamented by the women, Keśava and Ráma
quitted the district of Vraja <span id="fr_1503"></span>[1](#fn_1503.md).
Travelling in a car drawn by fleet horses, they arrived at noon at the
banks of the Yamuná, when Akrúra requested them to halt a little, whilst
he performed the

<span id="page_546">p. 546</span>

usual daily ceremonial in the river <span
id="fr_1504"></span>[2](#fn_1504.md). Accordingly the intelligent Akrúra
bathed, and rinsed his mouth, and then entering the stream, he stood
meditating upon the supreme being; but he beheld mentally <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[3](#fn_1505.md) Balabhadra, having a thousand hooded
beads, a garland of Jasmine flowers, and large red eyes, attended by
Vásuki, Rambha, and other mighty serpents, praised by the Gandharbas,
decorated with wild flowers, wearing dark coloured garments, crowned
with a chaplet of lotuses, ornamented with brilliant earrings,
inebriate, and standing at the bottom of the river in the water <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[4](#fn_1506.md). On his lap he also beheld, at his
ease, Krishńa, of the complexion of a cloud <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[5](#fn_1507.md), with full and coppery eyes, having an
elegant form, and four hands, armed with the discus and other weapons,
wearing yellow clothes, decorated with many coloured flowers, and
appearing like a cloud embellished with streams of lightning and the bow
of Indra; his breast was marked with the celestial sign, his arms were
radiant with bracelets, a diadem shone on his brow, and he wore a white
lotus for his crest: he was attended by Sanandana and other holy sages,
who, fixing their eyes upon the tips of their noses, were absorbed in
profound meditation.

When Akrúra beheld Balaráma and Krishńa in this situation, he was much
amazed, and wondered how they could so quickly have got there from the
chariot. He wished to ask them this, but Janárddana deprived him of the
faculty of speech at the moment. Ascending then from the water, he
repaired to the car, and there he found them both quietly seated in the
same human persons as before. Plunging again into the water, there he
again beheld them, hymned as before by the Gandharbas, saints, sages,
and serpents. Apprehending, therefore, their real character, he thus
eulogized the eternal deity, who consists of true knowledge:--

<span id="page_547">p. 547</span>

"Salutation to thee, who art uniform and manifold, all-pervading,
supreme spirit, of inconceivable glory, and who art simple existence.
Salutation to thee, O inscrutable, who art truth, and the essence of
oblations. Salutation to thee, O lord, whose nature is unknown, who art
beyond primeval matter, who existest in five forms, as one with the
elements, with the faculties, with matter, with the living soul, with
supreme spirit. Shew favour to me, O soul of the universe, essence of
all things, perishable or eternal, whether addressed by the designation
of Brahmá, Vishńu, Śiva, or the like. I adore thee, O god, whose nature
is indescribable, whose purposes are inscrutable, whose name even is
unknown; for the attributes of kind or appellation are not applicable to
thee, who art THAT <span id="fr_1508"></span>[6](#fn_1508.md), the supreme
Brahma, eternal, unchangeable, untreated. But as the accomplishment of
our objects cannot be attained except through some specific form, thou
art termed by us Krishńa, Achyuta, Ananta, or Vishńu. Thou, unborn
divinity, art all the objects of these impersonations; thou art the
gods, and all other beings; thou art the whole world; thou art all. Soul
of the universe, thou art exempt from change, and there is nothing
except thee in all this existence. Thou art Brahmá, Paśupati, Áryaman,
Dhátri, and Vidhátri; thou art Indra, air, fire, the regent of the
waters, the god of wealth, and judge of the dead; and thou, although but
one, presidest over the world with various energies, addressed to
various purposes. Thou, identical with the solar ray, createst the
universe; all elementary substance is composed of thy qualities; and thy
supreme form is denoted by the imperishable term SAT (existence). To him
who is one with true knowledge, who is and is not perceptible, I bow.
Glory be to him, the lord Vásudeva, to Sankarshańa, to Pradyumna, and to
Aniruddha <span id="fr_1509"></span>[7](#fn_1509.md)."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1503"></span>[545:1](vp135.htm#fr_1503.md) In the Bhágavata,
Hari Vanśa, &c. several adventures of Krishńa, during his residence at
Vraja, are recorded, of which our text makes no mention. Of these, the
two most popular are Krishńa's taking away the clothes of the Gopís
whilst bathing, and his liberating the Gopas from the mouth of Aghásura,
disguised as a vast serpent, into which they had entered, thinking it a
cavern in a mountain. The omission of these two legends, or of any of
the rest, is not much to be regretted.

<span id="fn_1504"></span>[546:2](vp135.htm#fr_1504.md) The noonday prayer,
or Sandhya.

<span id="fn_1505"></span>[546:3](vp135.htm#fr_1505.md) By his Dhyána, or
force of meditation, in which it is attempted to bring before the mind's
eye some definite form of the object of adoration. In this case Akrúra
is compelled to see a form he did not anticipate. The Hari Vanśa very
clumsily sets him to meditate upon the serpent Śesha, which spoils the
story, intended as that is to exhibit the identity of Balaráma and
Krishńa with the supreme.

<span id="fn_1506"></span>[546:4](vp135.htm#fr_1506.md) Balaráma was thus
visible in his real character of Śesha, the chief of serpents, the couch
of Vishńu, and supporter of the world.

<span id="fn_1507"></span>[546:5](vp135.htm#fr_1507.md) Or rather, he
beheld Ghanaśyáma, an appellation of Krishńa, who is so called from
being as black (śyama) as a cloud (ghana).

<span id="fn_1508"></span>[547:6](vp135.htm#fr_1508.md) Tad, 'that;' all
that is, or that can be conceived.

<span id="fn_1509"></span>[547:7](vp135.htm#fr_1509.md) Akrúra's piety is
here prophetic; the son and grandson of Krishńa (see [p.
440](vp108.htm#page_440).md) are not yet born: but this is the Vaishńava
style of addressing Krishńa or Vishńu, as identical with four Vyúhas,
'arrangements' or 'dispositions,' Krishńa, Balaráma, Pradyumna, and
Aniruddha. See As. Res. XVI. 35. In this, as in several other places,
the Vishńu P. differs from some of the other narratives of Krishńa, by
the length and character of the prayers addressed to Vishńu. The Hari
Vanśa, for instance, here has no prayer or panegyric at all: the
Bhágavata inserts one.
