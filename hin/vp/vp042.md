### CHAP. VIII.

Origin of Rudra: his becoming eight Rudras: their wives and children.
The posterity of Bhrigu. Account of Śrí in conjunction with Vishńu.
Sacrifice of Daksha.

PARÁŚARA.--I have described to you, oh great Muni, the creation of
Brahmá, in which the quality of darkness prevailed. I will now explain
to you the creation of Rudra <span id="fr_214"></span>[1](#fn_214.md).

In the beginning of the Kalpa, as Brahmá purposed to create a son, who
should be like himself, a youth of a purple complexion <span
id="fr_215"></span>[2](#fn_215.md) appeared, crying with a low cry, and
running about <span id="fr_216"></span>[3](#fn_216.md). Brahmá, when he
beheld him thus afflicted, said to him, "Why dost thou weep?" "Give me a
name," replied the boy. "Rudra be thy name," rejoined the great father
of all creatures: "be composed; desist from tears." But, thus addressed,
the boy still wept seven times, and Brahmá therefore gave to him seven
other denominations; and to these eight persons regions and wives and
posterity belong. The eight manifestations, then, are named Rudra,
Bhava, Śarva, Iśána, Paśupati, Bhíma, Ugra, and Mahádeva, which were
given to them by their great progenitor. He also assigned to them their
respective stations, the sun, water, earth, air, fire, ether, the
ministrant Brahman, and the moon; for these are their several
forms <span id="fr_217"></span>[4](#fn_217.md). The wives

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

of the sun and the other manifestations, termed Rudra and the rest, were
respectively, Suverchalá, Ushá, Vikesí, Sivá, Swáhá, Diśá, Díkshá, and
Rohiní. Now hear an account of their progeny, by whose successive
generations this world has been peopled. Their sons, then, were
severally, Sanaiśchara (Saturn), Śukra (Venus), the fiery-bodied Mars,
Manojava (Hanumán), Skanda, Swarga, Santána, and Budha (Mercury).

It was the Rudra of this description that married Satí, who abandoned
her corporeal existence in consequence of the displeasure of
Daksha <span id="fr_218"></span>[5](#fn_218.md). She afterwards was the
daughter of Himaván (the snowy mountains) by Mená; and in that
character, as the only Umá, the mighty Bhava again married her <span
id="fr_219"></span>[6](#fn_219.md). The divinities Dhátá and Vidhátá were
born to Bhrigu by Khyáti, as was a daughter, Śrí, the wife of Náráyańa,
the god of gods <span id="fr_220"></span>[7](#fn_220.md).

MAITREYA.--It is commonly said that the goddess Śrí was born from the
sea of milk, when it was churned for ambrosia; how then can you say that
she was the daughter of Bhrigu by Khyáti.

PARÁŚARA.--Śrí, the bride of Vishńu, the mother of the world, is

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

eternal, imperishable; in like manner as he is all-pervading, so also is
she, oh best of Brahmans, omnipresent. Vishńu is meaning; she is speech.
Hari is polity (Naya); she is prudence (Níti). Vishńu is understanding;
she is intellect. He is righteousness; she is devotion. He is the
creator; she is creation. Śrí is the earth; Hari the support of it. The
deity is content; the eternal Lakshmí is resignation. He is desire; Śrí
is wish. He is sacrifice; she is sacrificial donation (Dakshiná). The
goddess is the invocation which attends the oblation; Janárddana is the
oblation. Lakshmí is the chamber where the females are present (at a
religious ceremony); Madhusúdana the apartment of the males of the
family. Lakshmí is the altar; Hari the stake (to which the victim is
bound). Śrí is the fuel; Hari the holy grass (Kuśa). He is the
personified Sáma veda; the goddess, lotus-throned, is the tone of its
chanting. Lakshmí is the prayer of oblation (Swáhá); Vásudeva, the lord
of the world, is the sacrificial fire. Saurí (Vishńu) is Śankara (Śiva);
and Śrí is the bride of Śiva (Gaurí). Keśava, oh Maitreya, is the sun;
and his radiance is the lotus-seated goddess. Vishńu is the tribe of
progenitors (Pitrigana); Padma. is their bride (Swadhá), the eternal
bestower of nutriment. Śrí is the heavens; Vishńu, who is one with all
things, is wide extended space. The lord of Śrí is the moon; she is his
unfading light. She is called the moving principle of the world; he, the
wind which bloweth every where. Govinda is the ocean; Lakshmí its shore.
Lakshmí is the consort of Indra (Indrání); Madhusúdana is Devendra. The
holder of the discus (Vishńu) is Yama (the regent of Tartarus); the
lotus-throned goddess is his dusky spouse (Dhúmorná). Śrí is wealth;
Śridhara (Vishńu) is himself the god of riches (Kuvera). Lakshmí,
illustrious Brahman, is Gaurí; and Keśava, is the deity of ocean
(Varuna). Śrí is the host of heaven (Devasená); the deity of war, her
lord, is Hari. The wielder of the mace is resistance; the power to
oppose is Śrí. Lakshmí is the Kásht́há and the Kalá; Hari the Nimesha and
the Muhúrtta. Lakshmí is the light; and Hari, who is all, and lord of
all, the lamp. She, the mother of the world, is the creeping vine; and
Vishńu the tree round which she clings. She is the night; the god who is
armed with the mace and discus is the day. He, the bestower of
blessings, is the bridegroom; the lotus-throned goddess is the bride.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The god is one
with all male--the goddess one with all female, rivers. The lotus-eyed
deity is the standard; the goddess seated on a lotus the banner. Lakshmí
is cupidity; Náráyańa, the master of the world, is covetousness. Oh thou
who knowest what righteousness is, Govinda is love; and Lakshmí, his
gentle spouse, is pleasure. But why thus diffusely enumerate their
presence: it is enough to say, in a word, that of gods, animals, and
men, Hari is all that is called male; Lakshmí is all that is termed
female: there is nothing else than they.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_214"></span>[58:1](vp042.htm#fr_214.md) The creation of Rudra
has been already adverted to, and that seems to be the primitive form of
the legend. We have here another account, grounded apparently upon Śaiva
or Yogi mysticism.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[58:2](vp042.htm#fr_215.md) The appearance of
Rudra as a Kumára, 'a boy,' is described as of repeated occurrence in
the Linga and Váyu Puráńas, as already noticed ([p.
38](vp039.htm#page_38).md); and these Kumáras are of different complexions
in different Kalpas. In the Vaishńava Puráńas, however, we have only one
original form, to which the name of Nílalohita, the blue and red or
purple complexioned is assigned. In the Kúrma this youth comes from
Brahmá's mouth: in the Váyu, from his forehead.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[58:3](vp042.htm#fr_216.md) This is the Pauráńic
etymology: \#\#\# or rud, 'to weep,' and dru, 'to run' The grammarians
derive the name from rud, 'to weep,' with ra affix.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[58:4](vp042.htm#fr_217.md) The Váyu details the
application of each name severally. These eight Rudras are therefore but
one, under as many appellations, and in as many types. The Padma,
Márkańd́eya, Kúrma, Linga, and Váyu agree with our text in the
nomenclature of the Rudras, and their types, their wives, and progeny.
The types are those which are enumerated in the Nándí, <span
id="page_59">p. 59</span> or opening benedictory verse, of Sakuntalá;
and the passage of the Vishńu P. was found by Mons. Chezy on the
envelope of his copy. He has justly corrected Sir Wm. Jones's version of
the term \#\#\# 'the sacrifice is performed with solemnity;' as the word
means, 'Brahmane officiant,' 'the Bráhmań who is qualified by initiation
(Díkshá) to conduct the rite.' These are considered as the bodies, or
visible forms, of those modifications of Rudra which are variously
named, and which, being praised in them, severally abstain from harming
them: \#\#\# Váyu P. The Bhágavata, III. 12, has a different scheme, as
usual; but it confounds the notion of the eleven Rudras, to whom the
text subsequently adverts, with that of the eight here specified. These
eleven it terms Manyu, Manu, Mahínasa, Mahán, Siva, Ritadhwaja,
Ugraretas, Bhava, Kála, Vámadeva, and Dhritavrata: their wives are, Dhí,
Dhriti, Rasalomá, Niyut, Sarpí, Ilá, Ambiká, Irávatí, Swadhá, Díkshá,
Rudrání: and their places are, the heart, senses, breath, ether, air,
fire, water, earth, sun, moon, and tapas, or ascetic devotion. The same
allegory or mystification characterises both accounts.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[59:5](vp042.htm#fr_218.md) See the story of
Daksha's sacrifice at the end of the chapter.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[59:6](vp042.htm#fr_219.md) The story of Umá's
birth and marriage occurs in the Śiva P. and in the Káśí Khanda of the
Skanda P.: it is noticed briefly, and with some variation from the
Puráńas, in the Rámáyańa, first book: it is also given in detail in the
Kumára Sambhava of Kálidása.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[59:7](vp042.htm#fr_220.md) The family of Bhrigu
is more particularly described in the tenth chapter: it is here
mentioned merely to introduce the story of the birth of the goddess of
prosperity, Śrí.
