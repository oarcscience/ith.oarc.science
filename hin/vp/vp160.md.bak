### CHAP. V.

The third kind of dissolution, or final liberation from existence. Evils
of worldly life. Sufferings in infancy, manhood, old age. Pains of hell.
Imperfect felicity of heaven. Exemption from birth desirable by the
wise. The nature of spirit or god. Meaning of the terms Bhagavat and
Vásudeva.

THE wise man having investigated the three kinds of worldly pain, or
mental and bodily affliction and the like <span
id="fr_1622"></span>[1](#fn_1622.md), and having acquired true wisdom, and
detachment from human objects, obtains final dissolution. The first of
the three pains, or Ádhyátmika, is of two kinds, bodily and mental.
Bodily pain is of many kinds, as you shall hear. Affections of the head,
catarrh, fever, cholic, fistula, spleen, hemorrhoids, intumescence,
sickness, ophthalmia, dysentery, leprosy, and many other diseases,
constitute bodily affliction. Mental sufferings are love, anger, fear,
hate, covetousness, stupefaction, despair, sorrow, malice, disdain,
jealousy, envy, and many other passions which are engendered in the
mind. These and various other afflictions, mental or corporeal, are
comprised, under the class of worldly sufferings, which is called
Ádhyátmika (natural and inseparable). That pain to which, excellent
Brahman, the term Ádhibhautika (natural, but incidental) is applied, is
every kind of evil which is inflicted (from without) upon men by beasts,
birds, men, goblins, snakes, fiends, or reptiles; and the pain that is
termed Ádhidaivika (or superhuman) is the work of cold, heat, wind,
rain, lightning, and other (atmospherical phenomena). Affliction,
Maitreya, is multiplied in thousands of shapes in the progress of
conception, birth, decay, disease, death, and hell. The tender (and
subtile) animal exists in the embryo, surrounded by abundant filth,
floating in water, and distorted in its back, neck, and bones; enduring
severe pain even in the course of its developement, as disordered by the
acid, acrid, bitter, pungent, and saline articles of its mother's food;
incapable of extending or contracting

<span id="page_639">p. 639</span>

its limbs; reposing amidst the slime of ordure and urine; every way
incommoded; unable to breathe; endowed with consciousness, and calling
to memory many hundred previous births. Thus exists the embryo in
profound affliction, bound to the world by its former works.

When the child is about to be born, its face is besmeared by excrement,
urine, blood, mucus, and semen; its attachment to the uterus is ruptured
by the Prájápati wind; it is turned head downwards, and violently
expelled from the womb by the powerful and painful winds of parturition;
and the infant losing for a time all sensation, when brought in contact
with the external air, is immediately deprived of its intellectual
knowledge. Thus born, the child is tortured in every limb, as if pierced
with thorns, or cut to pieces with a saw, and falls from its fetid
lodgment, as from a sore, like a crawling thing upon the earth. Unable
to feel itself, unable to turn itself, it is dependent upon the will of
others for being bathed and nourished. Laid upon a dirty bed, it is
bitten by insects and musquitoes, and has not power to drive them away.
Many are the pangs attending birth, and many are those which succeed to
birth; and many are the sufferings which are inflicted by elemental and
superhuman agency in the state of childhood. Enveloped by the gloom of
ignorance, and internally bewildered, man knows not whence he is, who he
is, whither he goeth, nor what is his nature; by what bonds
[he](errata.htm#29.md) is bound; what is cause, and what is not cause; what
is to be done, and what is to be left undone; what is to be said, and
what is to be kept silent; what is righteousness, what is iniquity; in
what it consists, or how; what is right, what is wrong; what is virtue,
what is vice. Thus man, like a brute beast, addicted only to animal
gratifications, suffers the pain that ignorance occasions. Ignorance,
darkness, inactivity, influence those devoid of knowledge, so that pious
works are neglected; but hell is the consequence of neglect of religious
acts, according to the great sages, and the ignorant therefore suffer
affliction both in this world and in the next.

When old age arrives, the body is infirm; the limbs are relaxed; the
face is emaciate and shrivelled; the skin is wrinkled, and scantily
covers the veins and sinews; the eye discerns not afar off, and the
pupil gazes

<span id="page_640">p. 640</span>

on vacuity; the nostrils are stuffed with hair; the trunk trembles as it
moves; the bones appear beneath the surface; the back is bowed, and the
joints are bent; the digestive fire is extinct, and there is little
appetite and little vigour; walking, rising, sleeping, sitting, are all
painful efforts; the ear is dull; the eye is dim; the mouth is
disgusting with dribbling saliva; the senses no longer are obedient to
the will; and as death approaches, the things that are perceived even
are immediately forgotten. The utterance of a single sentence is
fatiguing, and wakefulness is perpetuated by difficult breathing,
coughing, and painful exhaustion. The old man is lifted up by somebody
else; he is clothed by somebody else; he is an object of contempt to his
servants, his children, and his wife. Incapable of cleanliness, of
amusement, or food, or desire, he is laughed at by his dependants, and
disregarded by his kin; and dwelling on the exploits of his youth, as on
the actions of a past life, he sighs deeply, and is sorely distressed.
Such are some of the pains which old age is condemned to suffer. I will
now describe to you the agonies of death.

The neck droops; the feet and hands are relaxed; the body trembles; the
man is repeatedly exhausted, subdued, and visited with interrupted
knowledge; the principle of selfishness afflicts him, and he thinks what
will become of my wealth, my lands, my children, my wife, my servants,
my house? the joints of his limbs are tortured with severe pains, as if
cut by a saw, or as if they were pierced by the sharp arrows of the
destroyer; he rolls his eyes, and tosses about his hands and feet; his
lips and palate are parched and dry, and his throat, obstructed by foul
humours and deranged vital airs, emits a rattling sound; he is afflicted
with burning heat, and with thirst, and with hunger; and he at last
passes away, t́ortured by the servants of the judge of the dead, to
undergo a renewal of his sufferings in another body. These are the
agonies which men have to endure when they die. I will now describe to
you the tortures which they suffer in hell.

Men are bound, when they die, by the servants of the king of Tartarus
with cords, and beaten with sticks, and have then to encounter the
fierce aspect of Yama, and the horrors of their terrible route. In the

<span id="page_641">p. 641</span>

different hells there are various intolerable tortures with burning
sand, fire, machines, and weapons; some are severed with saws, some
roasted in forges, some are chopped with axes, some buried in the
ground, some are mounted on stakes, some cast to wild beasts to be
devoured, some are gnawed by vultures, some torn by tigers, some are
boiled in oil, some rolled in caustic slime, some are precipitated from
great heights, some tossed upwards by engines. The number of punishments
inflicted in hell, which are the consequences of sin, is infinite <span
id="fr_1623"></span>[2](#fn_1623.md).

But not in hell alone do the souls of the deceased undergo pain: there
is no cessation even in heaven; for its temporary inhabitant is ever
tormented with the prospect of descending again to earth. Again is he
liable to conception and to birth; he is merged again into the embryo,
and repairs to it when about to be born; then he dies, as soon as born,
or in infancy, or in youth, or in manhood, or in old age. Death, sooner
or later, is inevitable. As long as he lives he is immersed in manifold
afflictions, like the seed of the cotton amidst the down that is to be
spun into thread. In acquiring, losing, and preserving wealth there are
many griefs; and so there are in the misfortunes of our friends.
Whatever is produced that is most acceptable to man, that, Maitreya,
becomes a seed whence springs the tree of sorrow. Wife, children,
servants, house, lands, riches, contribute much more to the misery than
to the happiness of mankind. Where could man, scorched by the fires of
the sun of this world, look for felicity, were it not for the shade
afforded by the tree of emancipation? Attainment of the divine being is
considered by the wise as the remedy of the threefold class of ills that
beset the different stages of life, conception, birth, and decay, as
characterized by that only happiness which effaces all other kinds of
felicity, however abundant, and as being absolute and final <span
id="fr_1624"></span>[3](#fn_1624.md).

It should therefore be the assiduous endeavour of wise men to attain
unto god <span id="fr_1625"></span>[4](#fn_1625.md). The means of such
attainment are said, great Muni, to be

<span id="page_642">p. 642</span>

knowledge and works. Knowledge is of two kinds, that which is derived
from scripture, and that which is derived from reflection. Brahma that
is the word is composed of scripture; Brahma that is supreme is produced
of reflection <span id="fr_1626"></span>[5](#fn_1626.md). Ignorance is
utter darkness, in which knowledge, obtained through any sense (as that
of hearing), shines like a lamp; but the knowledge that is derived from
reflection breaks upon the obscurity like the sun. What has been said by
Manu, when appealing to the meaning of the Vedas with respect to this
subject, I will repeat to you. There are two (forms of) spirit (or god),
the spirit which is the word, and the spirit which is supreme. He who is
thoroughly imbued with the word of god obtains supreme spirit <span
id="fr_1627"></span>[6](#fn_1627.md). The Atharva Veda also states that
there are two kinds of knowledge; by the one, which is the supreme, god
is attained; the other is that which consists of the Rich and other
Vedas <span id="fr_1628"></span>[7](#fn_1628.md). That which is
imperceptible, undecaying, inconceivable, unborn, inexhaustible,
indescribable; which has neither form, nor hands, nor feet; which is
almighty, omnipresent, eternal; the cause of all things, and without
cause; permeating all, itself unpenetrated, and from which all things
proceed; that is the object which the wise behold, that is Brahma, that
is the supreme state, that is the subject of contemplation to those who
desire liberation, that is the thing spoken of by the Vedas, the
infinitely subtile, supreme condition of Vishńu. That essence of the

<span id="page_643">p. 643</span>

supreme is defined by the term Bhagavat <span
id="fr_1629"></span>[8](#fn_1629.md): the word Bhagavat is the denomination
of that primeval and eternal god: and he who fully understands the
meaning of that expression, is possessed of holy wisdom, the sum and
substance of the three Vedas. The word Bhagavat is a convenient form to
be used in the adoration of that supreme being, to whom no term is
applicable; and therefore Bhagavat expresses that supreme spirit, which
is individual, almighty, and the cause of causes of all things. The
letter *Bh* implies the cherisher and supporter of the universe. By *ga*
is understood the leader, impeller, or creator. The dissyllable *Bhaga*
indicates the six properties, dominion, might, glory, splendour, wisdom,
and dispassion. The purport of the letter *va* is that elemental spirit
in which all beings exist, and which exists in all beings <span
id="fr_1630"></span>[9](#fn_1630.md). And thus this great word Bhagavan is
the name of Vásudeva, who is one with the supreme Brahma, and of no one
else. This word therefore, which is the general denomination of an
adorable object, is not used in reference to the supreme in a general,
but a special signification. When applied to any other (thing or person)
it is used in its customary or general import. In the latter case it may
purport one who knows the origin and end and revolutions of beings, and
what is wisdom, what ignorance. In the former it denotes wisdom, energy,
power, dominion, might, glory, without end, and without defect.

The term Vásudeva means that all beings abide in that supreme being, and
that he abides in all beings <span id="fr_1631"></span>[10](#fn_1631.md),
as was formerly explained by Keśidhwaja to Kháńd́ikya, called Janaka,
when he inquired of him an explanation of the name of the immortal,
Vásudeva. He said, "He

<span id="page_644">p. 644</span>

dwelleth internally in all beings, and all things dwell in him; and
thence the lord Vásudeva is the creator and preserver of the world. He,
though one with all beings, is beyond and separate from material nature
(Prakriti), front its products, from properties, from imperfections: he
is beyond all investing substance: he is universal soul; all the
interstices of the universe are filled up by him: he is one with all
good qualities; and all created beings are endowed with but a small
portion of his individuality. Assuming at will various forms, he bestows
benefits on the whole world, which was his work. Glory, might, dominion,
wisdom, energy, power, and other attributes, are collected in him.
Supreme of the supreme, in whom no imperfections abide, lord over finite
and infinite, god in individuals and universals, visible and invisible,
omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, almighty. The wisdom, perfect,
pure, supreme, undefiled, and one only, by which he is conceived,
contemplated, and known, that is wisdom; all else is ignorance."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1622"></span>[638:1](vp160.htm#fr_1622.md) The three kinds of
affliction, inseparable, incidental, and superhuman, are fully described
in the commentary on the first verse of the Sánkhya Káriká, p. 8, in a
similar strain as that which is adopted in the text.

<span id="fn_1623"></span>[641:2](vp160.htm#fr_1623.md) Some further
particulars of the different hells, and the punishments inflicted in
them, have been given before: see [p. 207](vp064.htm#page_207.md).

<span id="fn_1624"></span>[641:3](vp160.htm#fr_1624.md) All this is
conformable to the Sánkhya doctrines in particular, although the same
spirit pervades all Hindu metaphysics.

<span id="fn_1625"></span>[641:4](vp160.htm#fr_1625.md) Tasmát Tat práptaye
yatna kartavya <span id="page_642">p. 642</span> pańd́itairnaraih. The
expression Tat práptaye, 'for the obtaining of *that*,' refers to the
phrase immediately preceding, Bhagavatprapti, 'obtaining of,' or
'attaining to, Bhagavat,' the lord.

<span id="fn_1626"></span>[642:5](vp160.htm#fr_1626.md) Brahma is of two
kinds; Śabda-Brahma, spirit or god to be attained through the word, that
is, the Vedas and the duties they prescribe; and Para-Brahma, spirit or
god to be attained through reflection, by which the difference between
soul and matter is ascertained.

<span id="fn_1627"></span>[642:6](vp160.htm#fr_1627.md) This seems intended
as a quotation from Manu, but it has not been found in the code; it is
\#\#\#.

<span id="fn_1628"></span>[642:7](vp160.htm#fr_1628.md) The commentator
quotes other passages from the Vedas of a similar tendency, intimating,
however, the necessity of performing acts prior to attaining knowledge;
as, 'The decoction (preparatory process) being digested by rites,
thereafter knowledge is the supreme resource.' 'Having crossed the gulph
of death by ignorance (ceremonial acts), man obtains immortality by
(holy) knowledge.'

<span id="fn_1629"></span>[643:8](vp160.htm#fr_1629.md) According to the
comment, allusion is here made to the twelve syllable Mantra, or mystic
formula addressed to Vishńu: 'Om Bhagavate Vásudeváya nama; 'Om!
salutation to Bhagavat Vásudeva:' the repetition of which, by those
devoted (bhakta) to Vishńu, is the easy mode of securing their
liberation." The mysticism is, however, no doubt older than the worship
of Vishńu; and the term Bhagavat is defined in the text according to the
interpretation of the Vedas.

<span id="fn_1630"></span>[643:9](vp160.htm#fr_1630.md) The commentator
says these interpretations are from the Nirukta, the glossary of the
Vedas. The more etymological derivation of the term is, Bhaga, 'power,'
'authority,' and vat possessive affix.

<span id="fn_1631"></span>[643:10](vp160.htm#fr_1631.md) From the root Vas,
'abiding,' 'dwelling' See p. [1](vp035.htm#page_1.md) and
[9](vp036.htm#page_9.md).
