### CHAP. XXXVI.

The Asura Dwivida, in the form of an ape, destroyed by Balaráma.

HEAR also, Maitreya, another exploit performed by the mighty Balaráma.
The great Asura, the foe of the friends of the gods, Naraka, had a
friend of exceeding prowess in the monkey named Dwivida, who was
animated by implacable hostility against the deities, and vowed to
revenge on the whole of them the destruction of Naraka by Krishńa, at
the instigation of the king of the celestials, by preventing sacrifices,
and effecting the annihilation of the mortal sphere. Blinded by
ignorance, he accordingly interrupted all religious rites, subverted all
righteous observances, and occasioned the death of living beings: he set
fire to the forests, to villages, and to towns: sometimes he overwhelmed
cities and hamlets with falling rocks; or lifting up mountains in the
waters, he cast them into the ocean: then taking his place amidst the
deep, he agitated the waves, until the foaming sea rose above its
confines, and swept away the villages and cities situated upon its
shores. Dwivida also, who could assume what shape he would, enlarged his
bulk to an immense size, and rolling and tumbling and trampling amidst
the corn fields, he crushed and spoiled the harvests. The whole world,
disordered by this iniquitous monkey, was deprived of sacred study and
religious rites, and was greatly afflicted.

On one occasion Halá.yudha was drinking in the groves of Raivata, along
with the illustrious Revatí and other beautiful females; and the
distinguished Yadu, in whose praises songs were sung, and who was
preeminent amidst graceful and sportive women, resembled Kuvera, the god
of riches, in his palace. Whilst thus engaged, the monkey Dwivida came
there, and stealing the ploughshare and the club of Baladeva, grinned at
and mocked him, and laughed at the women, and threw over and broke the
cups filled with wine. Balaráma, becoming angry at this, threatened the
monkey; but the latter disregarded his menaces, and made a chattering
noise: on which Bala, starting up, seized his club in wrath;

<span id="page_605">p. 605</span>

and the monkey laid hold of a large rock, which he burled at the hero.
Bala casting his club at it, as it neared him, broke it into a thousand
fragments, which, together with the club, fell upon the ground.
Beholding the club prostrate, the monkey sprang over it, and struck the
Yádava violently on the breast with his paws. Bala replied with a blow
of his fist upon the forehead of Dwivida, which felled him, vomiting
blood, and lifeless, to the earth. The crest of the mountain on which he
fell was splintered into a hundred pieces by the weight of his body, as
if the thunderer had shivered it with his thunderbolt. The gods threw
down a shower of flowers upon Ráma, and approached him, and praised him
for the glorious feat he had performed. "Well has the world been freed,"
said they, "by thy prowess, O hero, of this vile ape, who was the ally
of the enemy of the gods." Then they and their attendant spirits
returned well pleased to heaven. Many such inimitable deeds were wrought
by the illustrious Baladeva, the impersonation of Śesha, the supporter
of the earth <span id="fr_1565"></span>[1](#fn_1565.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1565"></span>[605:1](vp153.htm#fr_1565.md) This exploit of
Balaráma is also similarly, but more vulgarly, related in the Bhágavata.
It is simply said in the Hari Vanśa, and erroneously, that Meńd́a and
Dwivida were conquered by Krishńa.
