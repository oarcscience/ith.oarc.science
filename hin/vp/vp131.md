### CHAP. XIV.

Krishńa kills the demon Arisht́a, in the form of a bull.

ONE evening, whilst Krishńa and the Gopís were amusing themselves in the
dance, the demon Arisht́a, disguised as a savage bull, came to the spot,
after having spread alarm through the station. His colour was that of a
cloud charged with rain; he had vast horns, and his eyes were like two
fiery suns: as he moved, he ploughed up the ground with his hoofs: his
tongue was repeatedly licking his lips; his tail was erect; the sinews
of his shoulders were firm, and between them rose a hump of enormous
dimensions; his haunches were soiled with ordure, and he was a terror to
the herds; his dewlap hung low, and his face was marked with scars from
butting against the trees. Terrifying all the kine, the demon who
perpetually haunts the forests in the shape of a bull, destroying
hermits and ascetics, advanced. Beholding an animal of such a formidable
aspect, the herdsmen and their women were exceedingly frightened, and
called aloud on Krishńa, who came to their succour, shouting and
slapping his arm in defiance. When the Daitya heard the noise, he turned
upon his challenger, and fixing his eyes and pointing his horns at the
belly of Keśava, he ran furiously upon the youth. Krishńa stirred not
from his post, but, smiling in sport and derision, awaited the near
approach of the bull, when he seized him as an alligator would have
done, and held him firmly by the horns, whilst he pressed his sides with
his knees. Having thus humbled his pride, and held him captive by his
horns, he wrung his throat, as if it had been a piece of wet cloth; and
then tearing off one of the horns, he beat the fierce demon with it
until he died, vomiting blood from his mouth. Seeing him slain, the
herdsmen glorified Krishńa, as the companies of the celestials of old
praised Indra, when he triumphed over the Asura Jambha <span
