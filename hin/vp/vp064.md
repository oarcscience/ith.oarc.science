### CHAP. VI.

Of the different hells or divisions of Naraka, below Pátála: the crimes
punished in them respectively: efficacy of expiation: meditation on
Vishńu the most effective expiation.

PARÁŚARA.--I will now, great Muni, give you an account of the hells
which are situated beneath the earth and beneath the waters <span
id="fr_655"></span>[1](#fn_655.md), and into which sinners are finally
sent.

The names of the different Narakas are as follows: Raurava, Śúkara,
Rodha, Tála, Viśasana, Mahájwála, Taptakumbha, Lavańa, Vimohana,
Rudhirándha, Vaitaraní, Krimíśa, Krimibhojana, Asipatravana, Krishńa,
Lálábhaksha, Dáruńa, Púyaváha, Pápa, Vahnijwála, Adhośiras, Sandansa,
Kálasútra, Tamas, Avíchi, Śwabhojana, Apratisht́ha, and another
Avíchi <span id="fr_656"></span>[2](#fn_656.md). These and many other
fearful hells are the awful provinces of the kingdom of Yama, terrible
with instruments of torture and with fire; into which are hurled all
those who are addicted when alive to sinful practices <span
id="fr_657"></span>[3](#fn_657.md).

The man who bears false witness through partiality, or who utters any
falsehood, is condemned to the Raurava (dreadful) hell. He who causes
abortion, plunders a town, kills a cow, or strangles a man, goes to the

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rodha hell (or
that of obstruction). The murderer of a Brahman, stealer of gold, or
drinker of wine, goes to the Súkara (swine) hell; as does any one who
associates with them. The murderer of a man of the second or third
castes, and one who is guilty of adultery with the wife of his spiritual
teacher, is sentenced to the Tála (padlock) hell: and one who holds
incestuous intercourse with a sister, or murders an ambassador, to
Taptakumbha (or the hell of heated caldrons). The seller of his wife, a
gaoler, a horsedealer, and one who deserts his adherents, falls into the
Taptaloha (red-hot iron) hell. He who commits incest with a
daughter-in-law or a daughter is cast into the Mahájwála hell (or that
of great flame): and he who is disrespectful to his spiritual guide, who
is abusive to his betters, who reviles the Vedas, or who sells
them <span id="fr_658"></span>[4](#fn_658.md), who associates with women in
a prohibited degree, into the Lavańa (salt) hell. A thief and a
contemner of prescribed observances falls into Vimohana (the place of
bewildering). He who hates his father, the Brahmans, and the gods, or
who spoils precious gems, is punished in the Krimibhaksha hell (where
worms are his food): and he who practises magic rites for the harm of
others, in the hell called Krimíśa (that of insects). The vile wretch
who eats his meal before offering food to the gods, to the manes, or to
guests, falls into the hell called Lálábhaksha (where saliva is given
for food). The maker of arrows is sentenced to the Vedhaka (piercing)
hell: and the maker of lances, swords, and other weapons, to the
dreadful hell called Viśasana (murderous). He who takes unlawful gifts
goes to the Adhomukha (or head-inverted) hell; as does one who offers
sacrifices to improper objects, and an observer of the stars (for the
prediction of events). He who eats by himself sweetmeats mixed with his
rice <span id="fr_659"></span>[5](#fn_659.md), and a Brahman who vends Lac,
flesh, liquors, sesamum, or salt, or one who commits violence, fall into
the hell (where matter flows, or) Púyaváha; as do they who rear cats,
cocks, goats, dogs, hogs, or birds. Public performers <span
id="fr_660"></span>[6](#fn_660.md), fishermen, the follower of one born in
adultery, a poisoner,

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

an informer, one who lives by his wife's prostitution <span
id="fr_661"></span>[7](#fn_661.md), one who attends to secular affairs on
the days of the Parvas (or full and new moon, &c.) <span
id="fr_662"></span>[8](#fn_662.md), an incendiary, a treacherous friend, a
soothsayer, one who performs religious ceremonies for rustics, and those
who sell the acid Asclepias, used in sacrifices, go to the Rudhirándha
hell (whose wells are of blood). He who destroys a bee-hive, or pillages
a hamlet, is condemned to the Vaitarańí hell. He who causes impotence,
trespasses on others' lands, is impure, or who lives by fraud, is
punished in the hell called (black, or) Krishńa. He who wantonly cuts
down trees goes to the Asipatravana hell (the leaves of whose trees are
swords): and a tender on sheep, and hunter of deer, to the hell termed
Vahnijwála (or fiery flame); as do those who apply fire to unbaked
vessels (potters). The violator of a vow, and one who breaks the rules
of his order, falls into the Sandansa (or hell of pincers): and the
religious student who sleeps in the day, and is, though unconsciously,
defiled; and they who, though mature, are instructed in sacred
literature by their children, receive punishment in the hell called
Śwabhojana (where they feed upon dogs). These hells, and hundreds and
thousands of others, are the places in which sinners pay the penalty of
their crimes. As numerous as are the offences that men commit, so many
are the hells in which they are punished: and all who deviate from the
duties imposed upon them by their caste and condition, whether in
thought, word, or deed, are sentenced to punishment in the regions of
the damned <span id="fr_663"></span>[9](#fn_663.md).

The gods in heaven are beheld by the inhabitants of hell, as they move
with their heads inverted; whilst the god, as they cast their eyes

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

downwards, behold the sufferings of those in hell <span
id="fr_664"></span>[10](#fn_664.md). The various stages of existence,
Maitreya, are inanimate things, fish, birds, animals, men, holy men,
gods, and liberated spirits; each in succession a thousand degrees
superior to that which precedes it: and through these stages the beings
that are either in heaven or in hell are destined to proceed, until
final emancipation be obtained <span id="fr_665"></span>[11](#fn_665.md).
That sinner goes to Naraka who neglects the due expiation of his guilt.

For, Maitreya, suitable acts of expiation have been enjoined by the
great sages for every kind of crime <span
id="fr_666"></span>[12](#fn_666.md). Arduous penances for great sins,
trifling ones for minor offences, have been propounded by Swáyambhuva
and others: but reliance upon Krishńa is far better than any such
expiatory acts, as religious austerity, or the like. Let any one who
repents of the sin of which he may have been culpable have recourse to
this best of all expiations, remembrance of Hari <span
id="fr_667"></span>[13](#fn_667.md): by addressing his thoughts to Náráyańa
at dawn, at night, at sunset, and midday, a man shall be quickly
cleansed from all guilt: the whole heap of worldly sorrows is dispersed
by meditating on Hari; and his worshipper, looking upon heavenly
fruition as an impediment to felicity, obtains final emancipation. He

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

whose mind is devoted to Hari in silent prayer, burnt-offering, or
adoration, is impatient even of the glory of the king of the gods. Of
what avail is ascent to the summit of heaven, if it is necessary to
return from thence to earth. How different is the meditation on
Vásudeva, which is the seed of eternal freedom. Hence, Muni, the man who
thinks of Vishńu, day and night, goes not to Naraka after death, for all
his sins are atoned for.

Heaven (or Swarga) is that which delights the mind; hell (or Naraka) is
that which gives it pain: hence vice is called hell; virtue is called
heaven <span id="fr_668"></span>[14](#fn_668.md). The selfsame thing is
applicable to the production of pleasure or pain, of malice or of anger.
Whence then can it be considered as essentially the same with either?
That which at one time is a source of enjoyment, becomes at another the
cause of suffering; and the same thing may at different seasons excite
wrath, or conciliate favour. It follows, then, that nothing is in itself
either pleasurable or painful; and pleasure and pain, and the like, are
merely definitions of various states of mind. That which alone is truth
is wisdom; but wisdom may be the cause of confinement to existence; for
all this universe is wisdom, there is nothing different from it; and
consequently, Maitreya, you are to conclude that both knowledge and
ignorance are comprised in wisdom <span
id="fr_669"></span>[15](#fn_669.md).

I have thus described to you the orb of the earth; the regions below its
surface, or Pátálas; and the Narakas, or hells; and have briefly
enumerated its oceans, mountains, continents, regions, and rivers: what
else do you wish to hear?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_655"></span>[207:1](vp064.htm#fr_655.md) The Bhágavata places
the Narakas above the waters. The commentator on our text endeavours to
reconcile the difference, by explaining the text to imply a dark cavity
in which the waters are received, not the original abysses where they
were collected at first, and above which Tartarus lies.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[207:2](vp064.htm#fr_656.md) Some of these names
are the same that are given by Manu, b. IV. v. 88-90. Kullúka Bhat́t́a
refers to the Márkańd́eya P. for a description of the twenty-one
divisions of hell; but the account there given is not more ample than
that of our text. The Bhágavata enumerates twenty-eight, but many of the
names differ from the above. In the last instance the term Avíchi is
either inaccurately repeated, or the adjective Apara is intended to
distinguish it from the previous Avíchi. In Manu, Mahávíchi occurs.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[207:3](vp064.htm#fr_657.md) The Padma P. (Kriya
Yoga Sára) and the Śiva Dharma, which appears to be a section of the
Skánda P., contain a number of interesting circumstances previous to the
infliction of punishment. It appears also from them that Yama fulfils
the office of judge of the dead, as well as sovereign of the damned; all
that die appearing before him, and being confronted with Chitragupta,
the recorder, by whom their actions have been registered. The virtuous
are thence conveyed to Swarga, or Elysium, whilst the wicked are driven
to the different regions of Naraka, or Tartarus.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[208:4](vp064.htm#fr_658.md) 'Who teaches the
Vedas for hire.' This notion still prevails, and renders the few Pandits
who are acquainted with the Vedas very unwilling to teach them for a
gratuity.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[208:5](vp064.htm#fr_659.md) 'Thereby,' observes
the commentator, 'defrauding or disappointing children.'

<span id="fn_660"></span>[208:6](vp064.htm#fr_660.md) Rangopajivina: the
commentator explains it wrestlers and boxers, but Ranga applies to any
stage or arena.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[209:7](vp064.htm#fr_661.md) The term in the text
is Máhishika, which might mean a feeder of buffaloes; but the
commentator quotes a text from the Smriti, authorizing the sense above
followed.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[209:8](vp064.htm#fr_662.md) This is the
interpretation of Parvakárí; it is also read Parvagámí, he who cohabits
with his wife on prohibited days.'

<span id="fn_663"></span>[209:9](vp064.htm#fr_663.md) An account of Naraka
is found in only a few of the Puráńas, and in less detail than in the
text. The Bhágavata and Váyu have similar descriptions of them. The
Márkańd́eya enters into detail in some of the instances only. A short
account is found in the Śiva, Garura, and Brahma Vaivartta P. and in the
Káśí Khańd́a of the Skánda P. The fullest descriptions, however, are
those mentioned in a previous note as being in the Śiva Dharma of the
Skánda, and Kriya Yoga Sára of the Padma; works of a somewhat equivocal
character, and belonging rather to Tántra than Pauráńik literature.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[210:10](vp064.htm#fr_664.md) The commentator
observes that the sight of heavenly bliss is given to the damned in
order to exacerbate their torments; whilst the inflictions of hell are
exhibited to the gods to teach them disregard of even heavenly
enjoyments, as they are but of temporary duration.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[210:11](vp064.htm#fr_665.md) That is, when
punishment or reward in hell or heaven, proportioned to the sin or
virtue of the individual, has been received, he must be born again as a
stone or plant, and gradually migrate through the several inferior
conditions, until he is once more born a man; his future state is then
in his own power.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[210:12](vp064.htm#fr_666.md) Manu is here
especially intended, as the commentator observes.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[210:13](vp064.htm#fr_667.md) This remembrance of
Vishńu is the frequent reiteration of any or all of his names: hence the
lower orders of Hindus procure a starling or parrot, that, in the act of
teaching it to cry Ráma or Krishńa or Rádhá, they may themselves repeat
these appellations; the simple recitation of which, even if
accidentally, irreverently, or reluctantly performed, is meritorious.
Thus according to the Vishńu Disarms Tantra: 'Let a man ever and every
where repeat the names of the discus-armed (Vishńu); for its repetition,
even by one who is impure, is a means of purification. Hari removes all
sins, even when invoked by evil-minded persons, as fire burns one by
whom it is unwillingly approached.'

<span id="fn_668"></span>[211:14](vp064.htm#fr_668.md) The object of the
text, according to the commentator, is to shew that the common notions
of heaven and hell are erroneous; that they are only temporal pleasure
and temporal pain; and virtue and vice, being the origin of transient,
and therefore unreal effects, are themselves unrealities: there is
nothing real but faith in Vishńu.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[211:15](vp064.htm#fr_669.md) Text and comment are
here somewhat obscure; but the purport of the former seems to be the
explanation of the existence of Jnyán wisdom, both as a genus and a
species: in the former case it is all that is; and in the latter, it may
be either true or false wisdom: the latter being influenced by notions
of self or individuality, and therefore the cause of confinement to
existence; the former dissipating the belief of self, and being
therefore the cause of liberation from bodily being.
