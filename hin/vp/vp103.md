### CHAP. X.

The sons of Nahusha. The sons of Yayáti: he is cursed by Śukra: wishes
his sons to exchange their vigour for his infirmities. Puru alone
consents. Yayáti restores him his youth: divides the earth amongst his
sons, under the supremacy of Puru.

YATI, Yayáti, Sanyáti, Áyáti, Viyati, and Kriti were the six valiant
sons of Nahusha <span id="fr_1094"></span>[1](#fn_1094.md). Yati declined
the sovereignty <span id="fr_1095"></span>[2](#fn_1095.md), and Yayáti
therefore succeeded to the throne. He had two wives, Devayání the
daughter of Usanas, and Śarmisht́há the daughter of Vrishaparvan; of whom
this genealogical verse is recited: "Devayání bore two sons, Yadu and
Turvasu. Sarmisht́há, the daughter of Vrishaparvan, had three sons,
Druhyu, Anu, and Puru <span id="fr_1096"></span>[3](#fn_1096.md)." Through
the curse of Uśanas, Yayáti

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

became old and infirm before his time; but having appeased his
father-in-law, he obtained permission to transfer his decrepitude to any
one who would consent to take it. He first applied to his eldest son
Yadu, and said, "Your maternal grandfather has brought this premature
decay upon me: by his permission, however, I may transfer it to you for
a thousand years. I am not yet satiate, with worldly enjoyments, and
wish to partake of them through the means of your youth. Do not refuse
compliance with my request." Yadu, however, was not willing to take upon
him his father's decay; on which his father denounced an imprecation
upon him, and said, "Your posterity shall not possess dominion." He then
applied successively to Druhyu, Turvasu, and Anu, and demanded of them
their juvenile vigour. They all refused, and were in consequence cursed
by the king. Lastly he made the same request of Sarmisht́há's youngest
son, Puru, who bowed to his father, and readily consented to give him
his youth, and receive in exchange Yayáti's infirmities, saying that his
father had conferred upon him a great favour.

The king Yayáti being thus endowed with renovated youth, conducted the
affairs of state for the good of his people, enjoying such pleasures as
were suited to his age and strength, and were not incompatible with
virtue. He formed a connexion with the celestial nymph Viśwáchí, and was
wholly attached to her, and conceived no end to his desires. The more
they were gratified, the more ardent they became; as it is said in this
verse, "Desire is not appeased by enjoyment: fire fed with sacrificial
oil becomes but the more intense. No one has ever more than enough of
rice, or barley, or gold, or cattle, or women: abandon therefore
inordinate desire. When a mind finds neither good nor ill in all
objects, but looks on all with an equal eye, then every thing yields it
pleasure. The wise man is filled with happiness, who escapes from
desire, which the feeble minded can with difficulty relinquish, and
which grows not old with the aged. The hair becomes grey, the teeth fall
out, as man advances in years; but the love of wealth, the love of life,
are not impaired by age." "A thousand years

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

have passed," reflected Yayáti, "and my mind is still devoted to
pleasure: every day my desires are awakened by new objects. I will
therefore now renounce all sensual enjoyment, and fix my mind upon
spiritual truth. Unaffected by the alternatives of pleasure and pain,
and having nothing I may call my own, I will henceforth roam the forests
with the deer."

Having made this determination, Yayáti restored his youth to Puru,
resumed his own decrepitude, installed his youngest son in the
sovereignty, and departed to the wood of penance (Tapovana <span
id="fr_1097"></span>[4](#fn_1097).md). To Turvasu he consigned the
south-east districts of his kingdom; the west to Druhyu; the south to
Yadu; and the north to Anu; to govern as viceroys under their younger
brother Puru, whom he appointed supreme monarch of the earth <span
id="fr_1098"></span>[5](#fn_1098.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1094"></span>[413:1](vp103.htm#fr_1094.md) The Bhágavata
refers briefly to the story of Nahusha, which is told in the Mahábhárata
more than once, in the Vana Parva, Udyoga P., Dána Dharma P., and
others; also in the Pádma and other Puráńas. He had obtained the rank of
Indra; but in his pride, or at the suggestion of Śachí, compelling the
Rishis to bear his litter, he was cursed by them to fall from his state,
and reappear upon earth as a serpent. From this form he was set free by
philosophical discussions with Yudhisht́hira, and received final
liberation. Much speculation, wholly unfounded, has been started by
Wilford's conjecture that the name of this prince, with Deva, 'divine,'
prefixed, a combination which never occurs, was the same as Dionysius or
Bacchus. Authorities generally agree as to the names of the first three
of his sons: in those of the others there is much variety, and the
Matsya, Agni, and Padma have seven names, as follows omitting the three
first of the text:

<div align="center">

|           |          |           |          |
|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Matsya.   | Agni.    | Padma.    | Linga.   |
| Udbhava   | Udbhava  | Udbhava   | Śaryáti  |
| Panśchi   | Panchaka | Pava      | Champaka |
| Sunyáti   | Pálaka   | Viyáti    | Andhaka  |
| Meghayáti | Megha    | Meghayáti |          |

</div>

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[413:2](vp103.htm#fr_1095.md) Or, as his name
implies, he became a devotee, a Yati: Bhágavata, &c.

<span id="fn_1096"></span>[413:3](vp103.htm#fr_1096.md) The story is told
in great detail in the Adi Parvan of the Mahábhárata, also in the
Bhágavata, with some additions evidently of a recent taste. Śarmisht́há,
the daughter of Vrishaparvan, king of the Daityas, having quarrelled
with Devayání, the daughter of Śúkra (the religious preceptor of the
same race), had her thrown into a well. Yayáti, hunting in the forest,
found her, and taking her to her father, with his consent espoused her.
Devayání, in resentment of Śarmisht́há's treatment, demanded that she
should become her handmaid; and Vrishaparvan, afraid of Śukra's
displeasure, was compelled to comply. In the service of his queen,
however, Yayáti beheld Śarmisht́há, and secretly wedded her. Devayání
complaining to her father of Yayáti's infidelity, Śukra inflicted on him
premature decay, with permission to transfer it to any one willing to
give him youth and strength in exchange, as is related in the text. The
passage specifying the sons of Yayáti is precisely the same in the
Mahábhárata <span id="page_414">p. 414</span> as in our text, and is
introduced in the same way.

<span id="fn_1097"></span>[415:4](vp103.htm#fr_1097.md) Bhrigutunga,
according to the Bráhma.

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[415:5](vp103.htm#fr_1098.md) The elder brothers
were made Mańd́ala-nripas, kings of circles or districts: Bhágavata. The
situation of their governments is not exactly agreed upon.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Linga
describes the ministers and people as expostulating with Yayáti, for
illegally giving the supremacy to the youngest son; but he satisfies
them by shewing that he was justified in setting the seniors aside, for
want of filial duty. The Mahábhárata, Udyoga P. Gálava Charitra, has a
legend of Yayáti's giving a daughter to the saint Gálava, who through
her means obtains from different princes eight hundred horses, white
with one black ear, as a fee for his preceptor Viswámitra. Yayáti, after
his death and residence in Indra's heaven, is again descending to earth,
when his daughter's sons give him the benefit of their devotions, and
replace him in the celestial sphere. It has the air of an old story. A
legend in some respects similar has been related in our text, [p.
399](vp099.htm#page_399.md).
