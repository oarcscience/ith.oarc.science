The Sixth Book

The last book contains an account of the dissolution of the world, in
both its major and minor cataclysms; and in the particulars of the end
of all things by fire and water, as well as in the principle of their
perpetual renovation, presents a faithful exhibition of opinions that
were general in the ancient world <span id="fr_93"></span>[95](#fn_93.md).
The metaphysical annihilation of the universe, by the release of the
spirit from bodily existence, offers, as already remarked, other
analogies to doctrines and practices taught by Pythagoras and Plato, and
by the Platonic Christians of later days.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_93"></span>[lxxi:95](vp030.htm#fr_93.md) Burnet has collected
the opinions of the ancient world on this subject, tracing them, as he
says, "to the earliest people, and the first appearances of wisdom,
after the flood." The Hindu account explains what is imperfect or
contradictory in ancient tradition, as handed down from other and less
carefully perpetuated sources. Theory of the Earth, b. III. c. 3.
