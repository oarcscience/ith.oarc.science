<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Descendants of Priyavrata, the eldest son of Sw&aacute;yambhuva Manu: his ten sons: three adopt a religious life; the others become kings of the seven Dw&iacute;pas, or isles, of the earth. Agn&iacute;dhra, king of Jambu-dw&iacute;pa, divides it into nine portions, which he distributes amongst his sons. N&aacute;bhi, king of the south, succeeded by Rishabha; and he by Bharata: India named after him Bh&aacute;rata: his descendants reign during the Sw&aacute;yambhuva Manwantara.</FONT></p>  
<p>MAITREYA.--You have related to me, venerable preceptor, most fully, all that I was curious to hear respecting the creation of the world; but there is a part of the subject which I am desirous again to have described. You stated that Priyavrata and Utt&aacute;nap&aacute;da were the sons of Sw&aacute;yambhuva Manu, and you repeated the story of Dhruva, the son of Utt&aacute;nap&aacute;da: you made no mention of the descendants of Priyavrata, and it is an account of his family that I beg you will kindly communicate to me.</p>  
<p>PAR&Aacute;&#346;ARA.--Priyavrata married K&aacute;my&aacute;, the daughter of the patriarch Kardama&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and had by her two daughters, Samr&aacute;t and Kukshi, and ten</p>

<p>sons, wise, valiant, modest, and dutiful, named Agn&iacute;dhra, Agnib&aacute;hu, Vapushmat, Dyutimat, Medha, Medhatithi, Bhavya, Savala, Putra, and the tenth was Jyotishmat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, illustrious by nature as by name. These were the sons of Priyavrata, famous for strength and prowess. Of these, three, or Medha, Putra, and Agnib&aacute;hu, adopted a religious life: remembering the occurrences of a prior existence, they did not covet dominion, but diligently practised the rites of devotion in due season, wholly disinterested, and looking for no reward.</p>  
<p>Priyavrata having divided the earth into seven continents, gave them respectively to his other seven sons&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. To Agn&iacute;dhra he gave Jambu-dw&iacute;pa; to Medhatithi he gave Plaksha-dw&iacute;pa: he installed Vapushmat in the sovereignty over the Dw&iacute;pa of S&aacute;lmali; and made Jyotishmat king of Ku&#347;a-dw&iacute;pa: he appointed Dyutimat to rule over Krauncha-dw&iacute;pa; Bhavya to reign over S&aacute;ka-dw&iacute;pa; and Savala he nominated the monarch of the Dw&iacute;pa of Pushkara.</p>  
<p>Agn&iacute;dhra, the king of Jambu-dw&iacute;pa, had nine sons, equal in splendour to the patriarchs: they were named N&aacute;bhi, Kimpurusha, Harivarsha, Il&aacute;vrita, Ramya, Hiran&#769;vat, Kuru, Bhadr&aacute;&#347;wa, and Ketum&aacute;la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, who was a prince ever active in the practice of piety.</p>  
<p>Hear next, Maitreya, in what manner Agn&iacute;dhra apportioned Jambu-dw&iacute;pa amongst his nine sons. He gave to N&aacute;bhi the country called Hima, south of the Himavat, or snowy mountains. The country of Hemak&uacute;t&#769;a he gave to Kimpurusha; and to Harivarsha, the country of</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Nishadha. The region in the centre of which mount Meru is situated he conferred on Il&aacute;vrita; and to Ramya, the countries lying between it and the N&iacute;la mountain. To Hiran&#769;vat his father gave the country lying to the north of it, called &#346;weta; and, on the north of the &#346;weta mountains, the country bounded by the &#346;ringav&aacute;n range he gave to Kuru. The countries on the east of Meru he assigned to Bhadr&aacute;&#347;wa; and Gandham&aacute;dana, which lay west of it, he gave to Ketum&aacute;la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.' Having installed his sons sovereigns in these several regions, the pious king Agn&iacute;dhra retired to a life of penance at the holy place of pilgrimage, &#346;&aacute;lagr&aacute;ma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The eight Varshas, or countries, Kimpurusha and the rest, are places of perfect enjoyment, where happiness is spontaneous and uninterrupted. In them there is no vicissitude, nor the dread of decrepitude or death: there is no distinction of virtue or vice, nor difference of degree as better or worse, nor any of the effects produced in this region by the revolutions of ages.</p>  
<p>N&aacute;bhi, who had for his portion the country of Him&aacute;hwa, had by his queen Meru the magnanimous Rishabha; and he had a hundred sons, the eldest of whom was Bharata. Rishabha having ruled with equity and wisdom, and celebrated many sacrificial rites, resigned the sovereignty of the earth to the heroic Bharata, and, retiring to the hermitage of Pulastya, adopted the life of an anchoret, practising religious penance, and performing all prescribed ceremonies, until, emaciated by his austerities, so as to be but a collection of skin and fibres, he put a pebble in his mouth, and naked went the way of all flesh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.

<p>Bharata, having religiously discharged the duties of his station, consigned the kingdom to his son Sumati, a most virtuous prince; and, engaging in devout practices, abandoned his life at the holy place, &#346;&aacute;lagr&aacute;ma: he was afterwards born again as a Brahman, in a distinguished family of ascetics. I shall hereafter relate to you his history.</p>  
<p>From the illustrious Sumati was born Indradyumna: his son was Paramesht&#769;hin: his son was Pratih&aacute;ra, who had a celebrated son, named</p>

The son of Prithu was Nakta: his son was Gaya: his son was Nara; whose son was Vir&aacute;t. The valiant son of Vir&aacute;t was Dh&iacute;mat, who begot Mah&aacute;nta; whose son was Manasyu; whose son was Twasht&#769;ri: his son was V&iacute;raja: his son was R&aacute;ja: his son was &#346;atajit, who had a hundred sons, of whom Viswagjyotish was the eldest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>. Under these princes, Bh&aacute;rata-varsha (India) was divided into nine portions (to be hereafter particularized); and their descendants successively held possession of the country for seventy-one periods of the aggregate of the four ages (or for the reign of a Manu).</p>  
<p>This was the creation of Sw&aacute;yambhuva Manu, by which the earth was peopled, when he presided over the first Manwantara, in the Kalpa of Var&aacute;ha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_373"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_364"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_364">161:1</A> The text reads Kany&aacute;; and the commentator has, 'he married the daughter of Kardama, whose name was Kany&aacute;.' The copies agree in the reading, and the V&aacute;yu has the same name, Kany&aacute;; but the M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, which is the same in other respects as our text, has K&aacute;my&aacute;: K&aacute;my&aacute; also is the name elsewhere given by the V&aacute;yu to the daughter of Kardama (<A HREF="vp045.htm#page_83">p. 83</A>. n. <A HREF="vp045.htm#fn_245">6</A>). K&aacute;my&aacute;, as has been noticed, appears in the Br&aacute;hma and Hari V. (<A HREF="vp041.htm#page_53">p. 53</A>. n. <A HREF="vp041.htm#fn_204">6</A>) as the mother of Priyavrata, but erroneously; and the same authorities specify a K&aacute;my&aacute; as the wife of that sovereign. So the commentator on the Hari V. states, 'another K&aacute;my&aacute; is mentioned (in the text), the daughter of Kardama, the wife of Priyavrata.' <a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></A> The name Kany&aacute; is therefore most probably an error of the copyists. The Bh&aacute;gavata calls the wife of Priyavrata, Varhishmat&iacute;, the daughter of Vi&#347;wakarman.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_365"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_365">162:2</A> These names nearly agree in the authorities which specify the descendants of Priyavrata, except in the Bh&aacute;gavata: that has an almost entirely different series of names, or &Aacute;gnidhra, Idhmajihwa, Yajnab&aacute;hu, Mah&aacute;v&iacute;ra, Hiran&#769;yaretas, Medhatithi, Ghritaprisht&#769;ha, Savana, Vitihotra, and Kavi; with one daughter, Urjjaswat&iacute;. It also calls the Manus Uttama, Tamasa, and Raivata the sons of Priyavrata by another wife.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_366"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_366">162:3</A> According to the Bh&aacute;gavata, he drove his chariot seven times round the earth, and the ruts left by the wheels became the beds of the oceans, separating it into seven Dw&iacute;pas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_367"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_367">162:4</A> Even the Bh&aacute;gavata concurs with the other Pur&aacute;n&#769;as in this series of Priyavrata's grandsons.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_368"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_368">163:5</A> Of these divisions, as well as of those of the earth, and of the minor divisions of the Varshas, we have further particulars in the following chapter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_369"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_369">163:6</A> This place of pilgrimage has not been found elsewhere. The term is usually applied to a stone, an ammonite, which is supposed to be a type of Vishn&#769;u, and of which the worship is enjoined in the Uttara Khan&#769;d&#769;a of the Padma P. and in the Brahma Vaivartta, authorities of no great weight or antiquity. As these stones are found chiefly in the Gandak river, the S&aacute;lagr&aacute;ma T&iacute;rtha was probably at the source of that stream, or at its confluence with the Ganges. Its sanctity, and that of the stone, are probably of comparatively modern origin.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_370"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_370">163:7</A> 'The great road,' or 'road of heroes.' The pebble was intended either to compel perpetual silence, or to prevent his eating. The Bh&aacute;gavata <a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></A> adverts to the same circumstance. That work enters much more into detail on the subject of Rishabha's devotion, and particularizes circumstances not found in any other Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. The most interesting of these are the scene of Rishabha's wanderings, which is said to be Konka, Venkat&#769;a, K&uacute;t&#769;aka, and southern Karn&aacute;taka, or the western part of the Peninsula; and the adoption of the Jain belief by the people of those countries. Thus it is said, "A king of the Konkas, Venkat&#769;as, and K&uacute;t&#769;akas, named Arhat, having heard the tradition of Rishabha's practices (or his wandering about naked, and desisting from religious rites), being infatuated by necessity, under the evil influence of the Kali age, will become needlessly alarmed, and abandon his own religious duty, and will foolishly enter upon an unrighteous and heretical path. Misled by him, and bewildered by the iniquitous operation of the Kali age, disturbed also by the delusions of the deity, wicked men will, in great numbers, desert the institutes and purifications of their own ritual; will observe vows injurious and disrespectful to the gods; will desist from ablutions, mouth-washings, and purifications, and will pluck out the hair of the head; and will revile the world, the deity, sacrifices, Brahmans, and the Vedas." It is also said, that Sumati, the son of Bharata, will be irreligiously worshipped by some infidels, as a divinity. Besides the import of the term Arhat, or Jain, Rishabha is the name of the first, and Sumati of the fifth T&iacute;rthakara, or Jain saint of the present era. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the Bh&aacute;gavata intends this sect; and as the Jain system was not matured until a comparatively modern date, this composition is determined to be also recent. The allusions to the extension of the Jain faith in the western parts of the Peninsula, may serve to fix the limit of its probable antiquity to the 11th or 12th century, when the Jains seem to have been flourishing in Guzerat and the Konkan. As. Res. XVII. 232.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_371"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_371">164:8</A> This etymology is given in other Pur&aacute;n&#769;as; but the Matsya and V&aacute;yu have a different one, deriving it from the Manu, called Bharata, or the cherisher, one who rears or cherishes progeny. The V&aacute;yu has, in another place, the more common explanation also: ###.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_372"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_372">165:9</A> The Agni, K&uacute;rma, M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, Linga, and V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;as agree with the Vishn&#769;u in these genealogical details. The Bh&aacute;gavata has some additions and variations of nomenclature, but is not essentially different. It ends, however, with &#346;atajit, and cites a stanza which would seem to make Viraja the last of the descendants of Priyavrata.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_373"></A><A HREF="vp058.htm#fr_373">165:10</A> The descendants of Priyavrata were the kings of the earth in the first or Sw&aacute;yambhuva Manwantara. Those of Utt&aacute;nap&aacute;da, his brother, are placed rather incongruously in the second or Sw&aacute;rochisha Manwantara: whilst, with still more palpable inconsistency, Daksha, a descendant of Utt&aacute;nap&aacute;da, gives his daughter to Ka&#347;yapa in the seventh or Vaivaswata Manwantara. It seems probable that the patriarchal genealogies are older than the chronological system of Manwantaras and Kalpas, and have been rather clumsily distributed amongst the different periods.</P>
