<p>PAR&Aacute;&#346;ARA.--Having thus described to you the system of the world in general, I will now explain to you the dimensions and situations of the sun and other luminaries.</p>  
<p>The chariot of the sun is nine thousand leagues in length, and the pole is of twice that longitude&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; the axle is fifteen millions and seven hundred thousand leagues long&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_681"></A><A HREF="#fn_681"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; on which is fixed a wheel with three naves, five spokes, and six peripheries, consisting of the ever-during year; the whole constituting the circle or wheel of time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_682"></A><A HREF="#fn_682"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> The two halves of the yoke are of the same length respectively as the two axles (the longer and the shorter). The short axle, with the short yoke, are supported by the pole-star: the end of the longer axle, to which the wheel of the car is attached, moves on the M&aacute;nasa mountain&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_684"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. The seven horses of the sun's car are the metres of the Vedas, G&aacute;yatr&iacute;, Vrihat&iacute;, Ushn&#769;ih, Jayat&iacute;, Trisht&#769;ubh, Anusht&#769;ubh, and Pankti.</p>  
<p>The city of Indra is situated on the eastern side of the M&aacute;nasottara mountain; that of Yama on the southern face; that of Varun&#769;a on the west; and that of Soma on the north: named severally Vaswokas&aacute;r&aacute;, Samyaman&iacute;, Mukhy&aacute;, and Vibh&aacute;var&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_685"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The glorious sun, Maitreya, darts like an arrow on his southern course, attended by the constellations of the Zodiac. He causes the difference between day and night, and is the divine vehicle and path of the sages who have overcome the inflictions of the world. Whilst the sun, who is the discriminator of all hours, shines in one continent in midday, in the opposite Dw&iacute;pas, Maitreya, it will be midnight: rising and setting are at all seasons, and are always (relatively) opposed in the different cardinal and intermediate points of the horizon. When the sun becomes visible to any people, to them he is said to rise; when he disappears from their</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></A></p>  
<p>view, that is called his setting. There is in truth neither rising nor setting of the sun, for he is always; and these terms merely imply his presence and his disappearance.</p>  
<p>When the sun (at midday) passes over either of the cities of the gods, on the M&aacute;nasottara mountain (at the cardinal points), his light extends to three cities and two intermediate points: when situated in an intermediate point, he illuminates two of the cities and three intermediate. points (in either case one hemisphere). From the period of his rise the sun moves with increasing rays until noon, when he proceeds towards his setting with rays diminishing (that is, his heat increases or diminishes in proportion as he advances to, or recedes from, the meridian of any place). The east and west quarters are so called from the sun's rising and setting there&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_686"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. As far as the sun shines in front, so far he shines behind and on either hand, illuminating all places except the summit of Meru, the mountain of the immortals; for when his rays reach the court of Brahm&aacute;, which is there situated, they are repelled and driven back by the overpowering radiance which there prevails: consequently there is always the alternation of day and night, according as the divisions of the continent lie in the northern (or southern) quarter, or inasmuch as they are situated north (or south) of Meru&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>The radiance of the solar orb, when the sun has set, is accumulated in fire, and hence fire is visible at a greater distance by night than by day: during the latter a fourth of the rays of fire blend with those of the sun, and from their union the sun shines with greater intensity by day. Elemental light, and heat derived from the sun or from fire, blending with each other, mutually prevail in various proportions, both by day and night. When the sun is present either in the southern or the northern hemisphere, day or night retires into the waters, according as they are invaded by darkness or light: it is from this cause that the waters look dark by day, because night is within them; and they look white by night, because at the setting of the sun the light of day takes refuge in their bosom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>When the sun has travelled in the centre of Pushkara a thirtieth part of the circumference of the globe, his course is equal in time to one Muh&uacute;rtta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A>; and whirling round like the circumference of the wheel of a potter, he distributes day and night upon the earth. In the commencement of his northern course, the sun passes to Capricornus, thence to Aquarius, thence to Pisces, going successively from one sign of the Zodiac to another. After he has passed through these, the sun attains his equinoctial movement (the vernal equinox), when he makes the day and night of equal duration. Thenceforward the length of the night decreases, and the day becomes longer, until the sun reaches the end of Gemini, when he pursues a different direction, and, entering Cancer, begins his declension to the south. As the circumference of a potter's</p>

<p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></A></p>  
<p>wheel revolves most rapidly, so the sun travels rapidly on his southern journey: he flies along his path with the velocity of wind, and traverses a great distance in a short time. In twelve Muh&uacute;rttas he passes through thirteen lunar asterisms and a half during the day; and during the night he passes through the same distance, only in eighteen Muh&uacute;rttas. As the centre of the potter's wheel revolves more slowly than the circumference, so the sun in his northern path again revolves with less rapidity, and moves over a less space of the earth in a longer time, until, at the end of his northern route, the day is again eighteen Muh&uacute;rttas, and the night twelve; the sun passing through half the lunar mansions by day and by night in those periods respectively. As the lump of clay on the centre of the potter's wheel moves most slowly, so the polar-star, which is in the centre of the zodiacal wheel, revolves very tardily, and ever remains in the centre, as the clay continues in the centre of the wheel of the potter.</p>  
<p>The relative length of the day or night depends upon the greater or less velocity with which the sun revolves through the degrees between the two points of the horizon. In the solstitial period, in which his diurnal path is quickest, his nocturnal is slowest; and in that in which he moves quick by night, he travels slowly by day. The extent of his journey is in either case the same; for in the course of the day and night he passes through all the signs of the Zodiac, or six by night, and the same number by day: the length and shortness of the day are measured by the extent of the signs; and the duration of day and night by the period which the sun takes to pass through them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_690"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A>. In his northern</p>

</p>  
<p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></A></p>  
<p>declination the sun moves quickest by night, and slowest by day; in his southern declination the reverse is the case.</p>  
<p>The night is called Ush&aacute;, and the day is denominated Vyusht&#769;a, and the interval between them is called Sandhya. On the occurrence of the awful Sandhya, the terrific fiends termed Mandehas attempt to devour the sun; for Brahm&aacute; denounced this curse upon them, that, without the power to perish, they should die every day (and revive by night), and therefore a fierce contest occurs daily between them and the sun&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_691"></A><A HREF="#fn_691"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>. At this season pious Brahmans scatter water, purified by the mystical Omk&aacute;ra, and consecrated by the G&aacute;yatri&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_692"></A><A HREF="#fn_692"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>; and by this water, as by a thunderbolt, the foul fiends are consumed. When the first oblation is offered with solemn invocations in the morning rite&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_693"></A><A HREF="#fn_693"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A>, the thousand-rayed deity shines forth with unclouded splendour. Omk&aacute;ra is Vishn&#769;u the mighty, the substance of the three Vedas, the lord of speech; and by its enunciation those R&aacute;kshasas are destroyed. The sun is a principal part of Vishn&#769;u, and light is his immutable essence, the active manifestation of which is excited by the mystic syllable Om. Light effused by the utterance of Omk&aacute;ra becomes radiant, and burns up entirely the R&aacute;kshasas called Mandehas. The performance of the Sandhya (the morning) sacrifice must never therefore be delayed, for he who neglects it is guilty of the murder of the sun. Protected thus by the Brahmans and the pigmy sages called B&aacute;lakhilyas, the sun goes on his course to give light to the world.</p>

<p>Fifteen twinklings of the eye (Nimeshas) make a K&aacute;sht&#769;h&aacute;; thirty K&aacute;sht&#769;h&aacute;s, a Kal&aacute;; thirty Kal&aacute;s, a Muh&uacute;rtta (forty-eight minutes); and thirty Muh&uacute;rttas, a day and night: the portions of the day are longer or shorter, as has been explained; but the Sandhy&aacute; is always the same in increase or decrease, being only one Muh&uacute;rtta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_694"></A><A HREF="#fn_694"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A>. From the period that a line may be drawn across the sun (or that half his orb is visible) to the expiration of three Muh&uacute;rttas (two hours and twenty-four minutes), that interval is called Pr&aacute;tar (morning), forming a fifth portion of the day. The next portion, or three Muh&uacute;rttas from morning, is termed Sangava (forenoon): the three next Muh&uacute;rttas constitute mid-day: the afternoon comprises the next three Muh&uacute;rttas: the three Muh&uacute;rttas following are considered as the evening: and the fifteen Muh&uacute;rttas of the day are thus classed in five portions of three each. But the day consists of fifteen Muh&uacute;rttas only at the equinoxes, increasing or diminishing in number in the northern and southern declinations of the sun, when the day encroaches on the night, or the night upon the day. The equinoxes occur in the seasons of spring and autumn, when the sun enters the signs of Aries and Libra. When the sun enters Capricorn (the winter solstice), his northern progress commences; and his southern when he enters Cancer (the summer solstice).</p>  
<p>Fifteen days of thirty Muh&uacute;rttas each are called a Paksha (a lunar fortnight); two of these make a month; and two months, a solar season; three seasons a northern or southern declination (Ayana); and those two compose a year. Years, made up of four kinds of months&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_695"></A><A HREF="#fn_695"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A>, are distinguished</p>

<p>into five kinds; and an aggregate of all the varieties of time is termed a Yoga, or cycle. The years are severally called Samvatsara, Parivatsara, Idvatsara, Anuvatsara, and Vatsara. This is the time called a Yuga&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_696"></A><A HREF="#fn_696"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The mountain range that lies most to the north (in Bh&aacute;rata-varsha) is called &#346;ringav&aacute;n (the horned), from its having three principal elevations (horns or peaks), one to the north, one to the south, and one in the centre; the last is called the equinoctial, for the sun arrives there in the middle of the two seasons of spring and autumn, entering the equinoctial points in the first degree of Aries and of Libra, and making day and night of equal duration, or fifteen Muh&uacute;rttas each. When the sun, most excellent sage, is in the first degree of the lunar mansion, Krittik&aacute;, and the moon is in the. fourth of Vi&#347;&aacute;kh&aacute;, or when the sun is in the third</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 225</font></A></p>  
<p>degree of Vi&#347;&aacute;kh&aacute;, and the moon is in the head of Krittik&aacute; (these positions being cotemporary with the equinoxes), that equinoctial season is holy (and is styled the Mah&aacute;vishubha, or the great equinox)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_697"></A><A HREF="#fn_697"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>. At this time offerings are to be presented to the gods and to the manes, and gifts are to be made to the Brahmans by serious persons; for such donations are productive of happiness. Liberality at the equinoxes is always advantageous to the donor: and day and night; seconds, minutes, and hours; intercalary months; the day of full moon (Paurnam&aacute;s&iacute;); the day of conjunction (Am&aacute;v&aacute;sya), when the moon rises invisible; the day when it is first seen (&#346;iniv&aacute;l&iacute;); the day when it first disappears (Kuh&uacute;); the day when the moon is quite round (R&aacute;k&aacute;); and the day when one digit is deficient (Anumati), are all seasons when gifts are meritorious.</p>  
<p>The sun is in his northern declination in the months Tapas, Tapasya, Madhu, M&aacute;dhava, &#346;ukra, and &#346;uchi; and in his southern in those of Nabhas, Nabhasya, Isha, &Uacute;rja, Sahas, Sahasya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_698"></A><A HREF="#fn_698"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>.</p>

Mutually descending from each other, progenitor springing from descendant, and descendant from progenitor, in the alternating succession of births, they repeatedly appear in different housed and races along with their posterity, devout practices and instituted observances, residing to the south of the solar orb, as long as the moon and stars endure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_701"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The path of the gods lies to the north of the solar sphere, north of the N&aacute;gavithi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_702"></A><A HREF="#fn_702"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A>, and south of the seven Rishis. There dwell the Siddhas, of subdued senses, continent and pure, undesirous of progeny, and therefore victorious over death: eighty-eight thousand of these chaste beings tenant the regions of the sky, north of the sun, until the destruction of the universe: they enjoy immortality, for that they are holy; exempt from covetousness and concupiscence, love and hatred; taking no part in the procreation of living beings, and detecting the unreality of the properties of elementary matter. By immortality is meant existence to the end of the Kalpa: life as long as the three regions (earth, sky, and heaven) last is called exemption from (reiterated) death&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_703"></A><A HREF="#fn_703"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A>.

<p>The space between the seven Rishis and Dhruva&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_705"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A>, the third region of the sky, is the splendid celestial path of Vishn&#769;u (Vishn&#769;upada), and the abode of those sanctified ascetics who are cleansed from every soil, and in whom virtue and vice are annihilated. This is that excellent place of Vishn&#769;u to which those repair in whom all sources of pain are extinct, in consequence of the cessation of the consequences of piety or iniquity, and where they never sorrow more. There abide Dharma, Dhruva, and other spectators of the world, radiant with the superhuman faculties of Vishn&#769;u, acquired through religious meditation; and there are fastened and inwoven to all that is, and all that shall ever be, animate or inanimate. The seat of Vishn&#769;u is contemplated by the wisdom of the Yogis, identified with supreme light, as the radiant eye of heaven. In this portion of the heavens the splendid Dhruva is stationed, and serves for the pivot of the atmosphere. On Dhruva rest the seven great planets, and on them depend the clouds. The rains are suspended in the clouds, and from the rains come the water which is the nutriment and delight of all, the gods and the rest; and they, the gods, who are the receivers of oblations, being nourished by burnt-offerings, cause the rain to fall for the support of created beings. This sacred station of Vishn&#769;u, therefore, is the support of the three worlds, as it is the source of rain.</p>  
<p>From that third region of the atmosphere, or seat of Vishn&#769;u, proceeds the stream that washes away all sin, the river Gang&aacute;, embrowned with the unguents of the nymphs of heaven, who have sported in her waters. Having her source in the nail of the great toe of Vishn&#769;u's left foot, Dhruva&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_706"></A><A HREF="#fn_706"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> receives her, and sustains her day and night devoutly on his head; and thence the seven Rishis practise the exercises of austerity in her waters, wreathing their braided locks with her waves. The orb of the moon, encompassed by her accumulated current, derives augmented lustre from her contact. Falling from on high, as she issues from the moon; she alights on the summit of Meru, and thence flows to the four</p>

<p>quarters of the earth, for its purification. The &#346;&iacute;t&aacute;, Alakanand&aacute;, Chakshu, and Bhadr&aacute; are four branches of but one river, divided according to the regions towards which it proceeds. The branch that is known as the Alakanand&aacute; was borne affectionately by Mah&aacute;deva, upon his head, for more than a hundred years, and was the river which raised to heaven the sinful sons of Sagara, by washing their ashes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A>. The offences of any man who bathes in this river are immediately expiated, and unprecedented virtue is engendered. Its waters, offered by sons to their ancestors in faith for three years, yield to the latter rarely attainable gratification. Men of the twice-born orders, who offer sacrifice in this river to the lord of sacrifice, Purushottama, obtain whatever they desire, either here or in heaven. Saints who are purified from all soil by bathing in its waters, and whose minds are intent on Ke&#347;ava, acquire thereby final liberation. This sacred stream, heard of, desired, seen, touched, bathed in, or hymned, day by day, sanctifies all beings; and those who, even at a distance of a hundred leagues, exclaim "Gang&aacute;, Gang&aacute;," atone for the sins committed during three previous lives. The place whence this river proceeds, for the purification of the three worlds, is the third division of the celestial regions, the seat of Vishn&#769;u&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_681"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_681">217:2</A> There is no great difference in this number in other accounts. The length of this axle, which extends from Meru to M&aacute;nasa, is nearly equal to the semidiameter of the earth, which, according to the Matsya P., is 18.950.000 Yojanas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_682"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_682">217:3</A> The three naves are the three divisions of the day, morning, noon, and night; the five spokes are the five cyclic years; and the six peripheries are the six seasons. The Bh&aacute;gavata explains the three naves to be three periods of the year, of four months each, and gives twelves spokes as types of the twelve months. The V&aacute;yu, Matsya, and Bhavishya Pur&aacute;n&#769;as enter into much more detail. According to them, the parts of the wheel are the same as above described: the body of the car is the year; its upper and lower half are the two solstices; Dharma is its flag; Artha and K&aacute;ma the pins of the yoke and axle; night is its fender; Nimeshas form its floor; a moment is the axle-tree; an instant the pole; minutes are its attendants; and hours its harness.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_683"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_683">217:4</A> This shorter axle is, according to the Bh&aacute;gavata, one fourth of the longer.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_684"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_684">218:5</A> We are to understand here, both in the axle and yoke, two levers, one horizontal, the other perpendicular. The horizontal arm of the axle has a wheel at one end; the other extremity is connected with the perpendicular arm. To the horizontal arm of the yoke are harnessed the horses; and its inner or right extremity is secured to the perpendicular. The upper ends of both perpendiculars are supposed to be attached to Dhruva, the pole-star, by two aerial cords, which are lengthened in the sun's southern course, and shortened in his northern; and retained by which to Dhruva, as to a pivot, the wheel of the car traverses the summit of the M&aacute;nasottara mountain on Pushkara-dw&iacute;pa, which runs like a ring round the several continents and oceans. The contrivance is commonly compared to an oil mill, and was probably suggested by that machine as constructed in India. As the M&aacute;nasottara mountain is but 50.000 leagues high, and Meru 84.000, whilst Dhruva is 1500.000, both levers are inclined at obtuse angles to the nave of the wheel and each other. In images of the sun, two equal and semicircular axles connect a central wheel with the sides of the car.</P>

When they face the rising sun, the west is of course behind them. The same circumstance determines the application of the term Dakshina, properly 'right,' &#0948;&#0949;&#0958;&#0953;&#8056;&#0962;, or 'dexterum,' to the south. Uttara, 'other' or 'last,' necessarily implies the north.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_687"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_687">219:8</A> This is rather obscure, but it is made out clearly enough in the commentary, and in the parallel passages in the V&aacute;yu, Matsya, Linga, K&uacute;rma, and Bh&aacute;gavata. The sun travels round the world, keeping Meru always on his right: to the spectator who fronts him therefore, as he rises, Meru must be always on the north; and as the sun's rays do not penetrate beyond the centre of the mountain, the regions beyond, or to the north of it, must be in darkness; whilst those on the south of it must be in light: north and south being relative, not absolute terms, depending upon the position of the spectator with regard to the sun and to Meru. So the commentator: ###. <a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></A> It was probably through some misapprehension of this doctrine that Major Wilford asserted, "by Meru the Paur&aacute;n&#769;iks understand in general the north pole, but the context of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as is against this supposition." As. Res. VIII. 286. There is no inconsistency, however, in Meru's being absolutely in the centre of the world, and relatively north to the inhabitants of the several portions, to all of whom the east is that quarter where the sun first appears, and the other quarters are thereby regulated.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_688"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_688">220:9</A> Similar notions are contained in the V&aacute;yu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_689"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_689">220:10</A> The sun travels at the rate of one-thirtieth of the earth's circumference in a Muh&uacute;rtta, or 31.50.000 Yojanas; making the total 9 crores and 45 lakhs, or 9.45.00.000; according to the V&aacute;yu, Lingo, and Matsya Pur&aacute;n&#769;as.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_690"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_690">221:11</A> This passage, which is somewhat at variance with the general doctrine, that the length of the day depends upon the velocity of the sun's course, and which has not been noticed in any other Paur&aacute;n&#769;ik text, is defended by the commentator, upon the authority of the Jyotish&#347;&aacute;stra, or astronomical writings. According to them, he asserts, the signs of the Zodiac are of different extent. Aquarius, Pisces, and Aries are the shortest; Taurus, Capricornus, and Gemini are something longer; Leo and Scorpio longer still; and the remaining four the longest of all. According to the six which the sun traverses, the day or night will be the longer or shorter. The text is, ###. The apparent contradiction may however be reconciled by understanding the sun's slow motion, and the length of a sign, to be equivalent terms.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_691"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_691">222:12</A> The same story occurs in the V&aacute;yu, with the addition that the Mandehas are three crores in number. It seems to be an ancient legend, imperfectly preserved in some of the Pur&aacute;n&#769;as.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_692"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_692">222:13</A> The sacred syllable Om has been already described (p. <A HREF="vp035.htm#page_1">1</A>. n. <A HREF="vp035.htm#fn_98">1</A>). The Gayatr&iacute;, or holiest verse of the Vedas, not to be uttered to ears profane, is a short prayer to the sun, identified as the supreme, and occurs in the tenth hymn of the fourth section of the third Asht&#769;aka of the Sanhit&aacute; of the Rig-veda: 'We meditate on that excellent light of the divine sun: may he illuminate our minds.' Such is the fear entertained of profaning this text, that copyists of the Vedas not unfrequently refrain from transcribing it, both in the Sanhit&aacute; and Bh&aacute;shya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_693"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_693">222:14</A> Or, in the text, with the prayer that commences with the words S&uacute;rya jyotir, 'That which is in the sun (or light) is adorable,' &amp;c. The whole prayer is given in Colebrooke's account of the religious ceremonies of the Hindus. As. Res. V. 355.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_694"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_694">223:15</A> But this comprehends the two Sandhy&aacute;s, 'morning and evening twilight.' Two N&aacute;ris, or half a Muh&uacute;rtta before sunrise, constitute the morning Sandhy&aacute;; and the same interval after sunset the evening. Sandhya, meaning 'junction,' is so termed as it is the juncture or interval between darkness and light; as in the V&aacute;yu and Matsya: ###.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_695"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_695">223:16</A> The four months are named in the V&aacute;yu, and are, 1. the Saura, or solar-sydereal, consisting of the sun's passage through a sign of the Zodiac: 2. the Saumya or Ch&aacute;ndra or lunar month, comprehending thirty lunations or Tithis, and reckoned most usually from new moon to new moon, though sometimes from full moon to full moon: 3. the S&aacute;vana or solar month, containing thirty days of sunrise and sunset: and 4. the N&aacute;kshatra or lunar <a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="green">p. 224</font></A> asterismal month, which is the moon's revolution through the twenty-eight lunar mansions.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_696"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_696">224:17</A> The five years forming this Yuga, or cycle, differ only in denomination, being composed of the months above described, with such Malam&aacute;sas, or intercalary months, as may be necessary to complete the period, according to Vriddha Garga. The cycle comprehends, therefore, sixty solar- sydereal months of 1800 days; sixty-one solar months, or 1830 days; sixty-two lunar months, or 1860 lunations; and sixty-seven lunar-asterismal months, or 1809 such days. Col. Warren, in his K&aacute;la Sankalit&aacute;, considers these years to be severally cycles. "In the cycle of sixty," he observes, "are contained five cycles of twelve years, each supposed equal to one year of the planet (Jupiter). I only mention this cycle because I found it mentioned in some books; but I know of no nation nor tribe that reckons time after that account. The names of the five cycles, or Yugs, are, 1. Samvatsara, 2. Parivatsara, 3. Idvatsara, 4. Anuvatsara, 5. Udravatsara. The name of each year is determined from the N&aacute;kshatra, in which Vrihaspati sets and rises heliacally, and they follow in the order of the lunar months." K. S. 212. It may be reasonably doubted, however, if this view be correct; and the only connexion between the cycle of five years and that of Vrihaspati may be the multiplication of the former by the latter (5 x 12), so as to form the cycle of sixty years: a cycle based, the commentator remarks, upon the conjunction (Yuga) of the sun and moon in every sixtieth year. The original and properly Indian cycle, however, is that of five years, as Bentley remarks. "The astronomers of this period (1181 B. C.) framed a cycle of five years for civil and religious ceremonies." Ancient and modern Hindu Astronomy. It is in fact, as Mr. Colebrooke states, the cycle of the Vedas, described in the Jyotish, or astronomical sections, and specified in the institutes of Par&aacute;&#347;ara as the basis of calculation for larger cycles. As. Res. VIII. 470.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_697"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_697">225:18</A> Reference is here made apparently, though indistinctly, to those positions of the planets which indicate, according to Bentley, the formation of the lunar mansions by Hindu astronomers, about 1424 B. C. Hindu Astronomy, p. 3 and 4. The V&aacute;yu and Linga Pur&aacute;n&#769;as specify the positions of the other planets at the same time, or the end, according to the former, of the Ch&aacute;kshusha Manwantara. At that time the sun was in Vi&#347;&aacute;kh&aacute;, the moon in Krittik&aacute;, Venus in Pushy&aacute;, Jupiter in P&uacute;rvaphalgun&iacute;, Mars in &Aacute;sh&aacute;d&#769;h&aacute;, Budha in Dhanisht&#769;h&aacute;, &#346;ani in Revat&iacute;, Ketu in &Aacute;slesh&aacute;, and R&aacute;hu in Bharan&iacute;. There are differences between some of these and the positions cited by Bentley, but most of them are the same. He considers them to have been observations of the occultations of the moon by the planets, in the respective lunar mansions, 1424-5 B. C. According to the V&aacute;yu, these positions or origins of the planets are from the Vedas: ###. The Linga, less accurately perhaps, reads ### referring it to the works of law.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_698"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_698">225:19</A> These are the names of the months which occur in the Vedas, and belong to a system now obsolete, as was noticed by Sir Wm. Jones. As. Res. III. 258. According to the classification of the text, they correspond severally with the lunar months M&aacute;gha, Ph&aacute;lguna, Chaitra, Vai&#347;&aacute;kha, Jyesht&#769;ha, &Aacute;sh&aacute;rha, or from December to June; and with &#346;r&aacute;van&#769;a, Bh&aacute;dra, &Aacute;swina, K&aacute;rtika, Agrah&aacute;yana, and Pausha, from July to December. From this order of the two series of the months, as occurring in the Vedas, Mr. Colebrooke infers, upon astronomical computations, their date to be about fourteen centuries prior to the Christian era. As. Res. VII. 283.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_699"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_699">226:20</A> The V&aacute;yu has the same names, but ascribes a different descent to the first, making Sudh&aacute;man the son of Viraja. Sankhap&aacute;d is the son of Kardama: the other two are the sons of Parjanya and Rajas, consistently with the origin ascribed to these Lokap&aacute;las in the patriarchal genealogies of that Pur&aacute;n&#769;a (see <A HREF="vp045.htm#page_83">p. 83</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_700"></A><A HREF="vp066.htm#fr_700">226:21</A> Allusion is here made to some divisions of the celestial sphere which are not described in any other part of the text. The fullest, but still in some respects a confused and partly inaccurate account is given in the Matsya Pur&aacute;n&#769;a; but a more satisfactory description occurs in the comment on the Bh&aacute;gavata, there cited from the V&aacute;yu, but not found in the copies consulted on the present occasion. According to those details, the path (M&aacute;rga) of the sun and other planets amongst the lunar asterisms is divided into three portions or Avasht&#769;h&aacute;nas, northern, southern, and central, called severally Air&aacute;vata, J&aacute;radgava (Ajagava, Matsya P.), and Vaisw&aacute;nara. Each of these, again, is divided into three parts or V&iacute;this: those of the northern portion are termed N&aacute;gavithi, Gajav&iacute;thi, and Air&aacute;vati; those of the centre are &Aacute;rshabh&iacute; Gov&iacute;th&iacute;, and J&aacute;radgav&iacute;; and those of the south are named Ajav&iacute;th&iacute;, Mr&iacute;gavith&iacute;, and Vaisw&aacute;nar&iacute;.
