### CHAP. VIII.

The demon Dhenuka destroyed by Ráma.

AGAIN, tending upon the herds, Keśava and Ráma wandered through the
woods, and on one occasion came to a pleasing grove of palms, where
dwelt the fierce demon Dhenuka, feeding upon the flesh of deer.
Beholding the trees covered with fruit, and desirous of gathering it,
the cowherds called out to the brothers, and said, "See, Ráma; see,
Krishńa; in this grove, belonging to the great Dhenuka, the trees are
loaded with ripe fruit, the smell of which perfumes the air: we should
like to eat some. Will you throw some down?" As soon as the boys had
spoken, Sankarshańa and Krishńa shook the trees, and brought down the
fruit on the ground. Hearing the noise of the falling fruit, the fierce
and malignant demon Dhenuka, in the form of an ass, hastened to the spot
in a great passion, and began to kick Ráma on the breast with his hinder
heels. Ráma, however, seized him by both hind legs, and whirling him
round until he expired, tossed his carcass to the top of a palm tree,
from the branches of which it struck down abundance of fruit, like rain
drops poured upon earth by the wind. The animals that were of kin to
Dhenuka came running to his aid; but Krishńa and Ráma treated them in
the same manner, until the trees were laden with dead asses, and the
ground was strewed with ripe fruit. Henceforward the cattle grazed
unobstructed in the palm grove, and cropped the new pasturage, where
they had never before ventured <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1](#fn_1481.md).

<span id="fn_1481"></span>[517:1](vp125.htm#fr_1481.md) This exploit is
related in the Bhágavata, Hari Vanśa, and other Vaishńava Puráńas, much
in the same strain, but not always in the same place: it more commonly
precedes the legend of the discomfiture of Kálíya.
