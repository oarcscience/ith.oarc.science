### CHAP. X.

The descendants of the daughters of Daksha married to the Rishis.

MAITREYA.--Thou hast narrated to me, great Muni, all that I asked of
thee: now resume the account of the creation subsequently to Bhrigu.

PARÁŚARA.--Lakshmí, the bride of Vishńu, was the daughter of Bhrigu by
Khyáti. They had also two sons, Dhátri and Vidhátri, who married the two
daughters of the illustrious Meru, Áyati and Niryati; and had by them
each a son, named Práńa and Mrikańd́a. The son of the latter was
Márkańd́eya, from whom Vedaśiras was born <span
id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_240.md). The son of Práńa was named Dyutimat,
and his son was Rájavat; after whom, the race of Bhrigu became
infinitely multiplied.

Sambhúti, the wife of Maríchi, gave birth to Paurnamása, whose sons were
Virajas and Sarvaga. I shall hereafter notice his other descendants,
when I give a more particular account of the race of Maríchi <span
id="fr_241"></span>[2](#fn_241.md).

The wife of Angiras, Smriti, bore daughters named Siniválí, Kuhu,

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ráká, and Anumati
(phases of the moon <span id="fr_242"></span>[3](#fn_242).md). Anasúyá, the
wife of Atri, was the mother of three sinless sons, Soma (the moon),
Durvásas, and the ascetic Dattátreya <span
id="fr_243"></span>[4](#fn_243.md). Pulastya had, by Príti, a son called in
a former birth, or in the Swáyambhuva Manwantara, Dattoli, who is now
known as the sage Agastya <span id="fr_244"></span>[5](#fn_244.md). Kshamá,
the wife of the patriarch Pulaha, was the mother of three sons, Karmasa,
Arvarívat, and Sahishńu <span id="fr_245"></span>[6](#fn_245.md). The wife
of Kratu, Sannati, brought forth the sixty thousand Bálakhilyas, pigmy
sages, no bigger than a joint of the thumb, chaste, pious, resplendent
as the rays of the sun <span id="fr_246"></span>[7](#fn_246.md). Vaśisht́ha
had seven sons by his wife Urjjá, Rajas, Gátra, Úrddhabáhu, Savana,
Anagha, Sutapas, and Śukra, the seven pure sages <span
id="fr_247"></span>[8](#fn_247.md). The Agni named Abhimání, who is the
eldest born of

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahmá, had, by
Swáhá, three sons of surpassing brilliancy, Pávaka, Pavamána, and Śuchi,
who drinks up water: they had forty-five sons, who, with the original
son of Brahmá and his three descendants, constitute the forty-nine
fires <span id="fr_248"></span>[9](#fn_248). The progenitors (Pitris.md),
who, as I have mentioned, were created by Brahmá, were the Agnishwáttas
and Varhishads; the former being devoid of, and the latter possessed of,
fires <span id="fr_249"></span>[10](#fn_249.md). By them, Swadhá had two
daughters, Mená and Dháraní, who were both acquainted with theological
truth, and both addicted to religious meditation; both accomplished in
perfect wisdom, and adorned with all estimable qualities <span
id="fr_250"></span>[11](#fn_250.md). Thus has been explained the progeny of
the

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

daughters of Daksha <span id="fr_251"></span>[12](#fn_251.md). He who with
faith recapitulates the account, shall never want offspring.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_240"></span>[82:1](vp045.htm#fr_240.md) The commentator
interprets the text \#\#\# to refer to Práńa: 'Vedaśiras was born the
son of Práńa.' So the Bhágavata has \#\#\#. The Linga, the Váyu, and
Márkańd́eya, however, confirm our reading of the text, making Vedaśiras
the son of Márkańd́eya. Práńa, or, as read in the two former, Páńd́u, was
married to Puńd́aríká, and had by her Dyutimat, whose sons were Srijávańa
and Asruta or Asrutavrańa. Mrikańd́a (also read Mrikańd́u) married
Manaswiní, and had Márkańd́eya, whose son, by Murddhanyá, was Vedaśiras:
he married Pívarí, and had many children, who constituted the family, or
Brahmanical tribe, of Bhárgavas, sons of Bhrigu. The most celebrated of
these was Uśanas, the preceptor of the Daityas, who, according to the
Bhágavata, was the son of Vedaśiras; but the Váyu makes him the son of
Bhrigu by Paulomí, and born at a different period.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[82:2](vp045.htm#fr_241.md) Alluding especially to
Kaśyapa, the son of Maríchi, of whose posterity a full detail is
subsequently given. The Bhágavata adds a daughter, Devakulyá; and the
Váyu and Linga, four daughters, Tusht́i, Pusht́i, Twishá, and Apachiti.
The latter inserts the grandsons of Paurnamása. Virajas, married to
Gaurí, has Sudháman, a Lokapála, or ruler of the east quarter; and
Parvasa (quasi Sarvaga) has, by Parvasí, Yajnaváma and Kaśyata, who were
both founders of Gotras, or families. The names of all these occur in
different forms in different MSS.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[83:3](vp045.htm#fr_242.md) The Bhágavata adds,
that in the Swárochisha Manwantara the sages Uttathya and Vrihaspati
were also sons of Angiras; and the Váyu, &c. specify Agni and Kírttimat
as the sons of the patriarch in the first Manwantara. Agni, married to
Sadwatí, has Parjanya, married to Maríchi; and their son is
Hiranyaroman, a Lokapála. Kírttimat has, by Dhenuká, two sons, Charishńu
and Dhritimat.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[83:4](vp045.htm#fr_243.md) The Bhágavata gives an
account of Atri's penance, by which the three gods, Brahmá, Vishńu, and
Śiva, were propitiated, and became, in portions of themselves, severally
his sons, Soma, Datta, and Durvásas. The Váyu has a totally different
series, or five sons, Satyanetra, Havya, Ápomurtti, Sani, and Soma; and
one daughter, Sruti, who became the wife of Kardama.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[83:5](vp045.htm#fr_244.md) The text would seem to
imply that he was called Agastya in a former Manwantara, but the
commentator explains it as above. The Bhágavata calls the wife of
Pulastya, Havirbhú, whose sons were the Muni Agastya, called in a former
birth Dahrágni or Jat́harágni, and Visravas. The latter had by Ilavilá,
the deity of wealth, Kuvera; and by Kesiní, the Rákshasas Rávańa,
Kumbhakarńa, and Vibhíshańa. The Váyu specifies three sons of Pulastya,
Dattoli, Vedabáhu, and Viníta; and one daughter, Sadwatí, married (see
note 3) to Agni.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[83:6](vp045.htm#fr_245.md) The Bhágavata reads
Karmaśresht́ha, Varíyas, and Sahishńu. The Váyu and Linga have Kardama
and Ambarísha in place of the two first, and add Vanakapívat and a
daughter, Pívarí, married to Vedaśiras (see note [1](#fn_240).md). Kardama
married Śruti (note [4](#fn_243).md), and had by her Sankhapáda, one of the
Lokapálas, and a daughter, Kámyá, married to Priyavrata (note
[6](vp041.htm#fn_204), [p. 53](vp041.htm#page_53).md). Vana-kapívat, also
read Dhana-k. and Ghana-k., had a son, Sahishńu, married to Yasodhará,
and they were the parents of Kámadeva.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[83:7](vp045.htm#fr_246.md) The different
authorities agree in this place. The Váyu adds two daughters, Punyá and
Sumatí, married to Yajnaváma (see note [2](#fn_241).md).

<span id="fn_247"></span>[83:8](vp045.htm#fr_247.md) The Bhágavata has an
entirely different set of names, or Chitraketu, Surochish, Virajas,
Mitra, Ulwana, Vasubhridyána, and <span id="page_84">p. 84</span>
Dyumat. It also specifies Saktri and others, as the issue of a different
marriage. The Váyu and Linga have the same sons as in our text, reading
Putra and Hasta in place of Gátra: they add a daughter, Puńd́ariká,
married to Pańd́u (see note [1](#fn_240).md). The eldest son, according to
the Váyu, espoused a daughter of Márkańd́eya, and had by her the Lokapála
of the west, Ketumat. The seven sons of Vaśisht́ha are termed in the text
the seven Rishis, appearing in that character in the third Manwantara.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[84:9](vp045.htm#fr_248.md) The eldest son of
Brahmá, according to the commentator, upon the authority of the Vedas.
The Váyu P. enters into a very long detail of the names and places of
the whole forty-nine fires. According to that, also, Pávaka is electric
or Vaidynta fire; Pavamána is that produced by friction, or Nirmathya;
and Śuchi is solar, Saura, fire. Pavamána was the parent of Kavyaváhana,
the fire of the Pitris; Śuchi of Havyaváhana, the fire of the gods; and
Pavamána of Saharaksha, the fire of the Asuras. The Bhágavata explains
these different fires to be so many appellations of fire employed in the
invocations with which different oblations to fire are offered in the
ritual of the Vedas: \#\#\# explained by the commentator, \#\#\#.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[84:10](vp045.htm#fr_249.md) According to the
commentator, this distinction is derived from the Vedas. The first
class, or Agnishwáttas, consists of those householders who, when alive,
did not maintain their domestic fires, nor offer burnt-sacrifices: the
second, of those who kept up the household flame, and presented
oblations with fire. Manu calls these Agnidagdhas and the reverse, which
Sir W. Jones renders, 'consumable by fire,' &c. Kullúka Bhat́t́a gives no
explanation of them. The Bhágavata adds other classes of Pitris; or, the
Ájyapas, drinkers of ghee;' and Somapás, drinkers of the acid juice.'
The commentator, explaining the meaning of the terms Ságnayas and
Anágnyas, has, \#\#\# which might be understood to signify, that the
Pitris who are 'without fire' are those to whom oblations are not
offered; and those 'with fire' are they to whom oblations are presented.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[84:11](vp045.htm#fr_250.md) The Váyu carries this
genealogy forward. Dháraní was married to Meru, and <span
id="page_85">p. 85</span> had by him Mandara and three daughters,
Niyati, Áyati, and Velá: the two first were married to Dhátri and
Vidhátri ([p. 81](vp044.htm#page_81).md). Velá was the wife of Samudra, by
whom she had Sámudrí, married to Prachínavarhish, and the mother of the
ten Prachetasas, the fathers of Daksha, as subsequently narrated. Mená
was married to Himávat, and was the mother of Maináka, and of Gangá, and
of Párvati or Umá.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[85:12](vp045.htm#fr_251.md) No notice is here
taken of Sati, married to Bhava, as is intimated in c. 8 ([p.
59](vp042.htm#page_59).md), when describing the Rudras. Of these
genealogies the fullest and apparently the oldest account is given in
the Váyu P.: as far as that of our text extends, the two nearly agree,
allowing for differences of appellation originating in inaccurate
transcription, the names frequently varying in different copies of the
same work, leaving it doubtful which reading should be preferred. The
Bhágavata, as observed above ([p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54.md). n.
[12](vp041.htm#fn_210).md), has created some further perplexity by
substituting, as the wives of the patriarchs, the daughters of Kardama
for those of Daksha. Of the general statement it may be observed, that
although in some respects allegorical, as in the names of the wives of
the Rishis ([p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54).md); and in others astronomical, as
in the denominations of the daughters of Anginas ([p. 82](#page_82).md);
yet it seems probable that it is not altogether fabulous, but that the
persons in some instances had a real existence, the genealogies
originating in imperfectly preserved traditions of the families of the
first teachers of the Hindu religion, and of the descent of individuals
who took an active share in its propagation.
