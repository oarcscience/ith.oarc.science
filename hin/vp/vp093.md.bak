MAITREYA.--Venerable preceptor, you have explained to me the perpetual
and occasional ceremonies which are to be performed by those righteous
individuals who are diligent in their devotions; and you have also
described to me the duties which devolve upon the several castes, and on
the different orders of the human race. I have now to request you will
relate to me the dynasties of the kings who have ruled over the
earth <span id="fr_916"></span>[1](#fn_916.md).

PARÁŚARA.--I will repeat to you, Maitreya, an account of the family of
Manu, commencing with Brahmá, and graced by a number of religious,
magnanimous, and heroic princes. Of which it is said, "The lineage of
him shall never be extinct, who daily calls to mind the race of

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Manu, originating
with Brahmá <span id="fr_917"></span>[2](#fn_917.md)." Listen therefore,
Maitreya, to the entire series of the princes of this family, by which
all sin shall be effaced.

Before the evolution of the mundane egg, existed Brahmá, who was
Hirańyagarbha, the form of that supreme Brahma which consists of Vishńu
as identical with the Rig, Yajur, and Sáma Vedas; the primeval,
uncreated cause of all worlds. From the right thumb of Brahmá was born
the patriarch Daksha <span id="fr_918"></span>[3](#fn_918.md); his daughter
was Aditi, who was the mother of the sun. The Manu Vaivaswata was the
son of the celestial luminary; and his sons were Ikshwáku, Nriga,
Dhrisht́a, Śaryáti, Narishyanta, Pránśu, Nábhága, Nedisht́a, Karúsha, and
Prishadhra <span id="fr_919"></span>[4](#fn_919.md).

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Before their
birth, the Manu being desirous of sons, offered a sacrifice for that
purpose to Mitra and Varuńa; but the rite being deranged, through an
irregularity of the ministering priest, a daughter, Ilá, was
produced <span id="fr_920"></span>[5](#fn_920.md). Through the favour of
the two divinities, however, her sex

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

was changed, and she became a man, named Sudyumna. At a subsequent
period, in consequence of becoming subject to the effects of a
malediction once pronounced by Śiva, Sudyumna was again transformed to a
woman in the vicinity of the hermitage of Budha, the son of the deity of
the moon. Budha saw and espoused her, and had by her a son named
Purúravas. After his birth, the illustrious Rishis, desirous of
restoring Sudyumna to his sex, prayed to the mighty Vishńu, who is the
essence of the four Vedas, of mind, of every thing, and of nothing; and
who is in the form of the sacrificial male; and through his favour Ilá
once more became Sudyumna, in which character he had three sons, Utkala,
Gaya, and Vinata <span id="fr_921"></span>[6](#fn_921.md).

In consequence of his having been formerly a female, Sudyumna was
excluded from any share in his paternal dominions; but his father, at
the suggestion of Vaśisht́ha, bestowed upon him the city
Pratisht́hána <span id="fr_922"></span>[7](#fn_922.md), and he gave it to
Purúravas.

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

Of the other sons of the Manu, Prishadhra, in consequence of the crime
of killing a cow, was degraded to the condition of a Śúdra <span
id="fr_923"></span>[8](#fn_923.md). From Karúsha descended the mighty
warriors termed Kárúshas (the sovereigns of the north <span
id="fr_924"></span>[9](#fn_924).md). The son of Nedisht́ha, named Nábhága,
became

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

a Vaiśya <span id="fr_925"></span>[10](#fn_925.md): his son was
Bhalandana <span id="fr_926"></span>[11](#fn_926.md); whose son was the
celebrated Vatsaprí <span id="fr_927"></span>[12](#fn_927.md): his son was
Pránsu; whose son was Prajáni <span id="fr_928"></span>[13](#fn_928.md);
whose son was Khanitra <span id="fr_929"></span>[14](#fn_929.md); whose son
was the very valiant Chakshupa <span id="fr_930"></span>[15](#fn_930.md);
whose son was Vinśa <span id="fr_931"></span>[16](#fn_931.md); whose son
was Vivinśati <span id="fr_932"></span>[17](#fn_932.md); whose son was
Khaninetra; whose son was the powerful, wealthy, and valiant
Karandhama <span id="fr_933"></span>[18](#fn_933.md); whose son was Avikshi
(or Avikshit <span id="fr_934"></span>[19](#fn_934).md); whose son was the
mighty Marutta, of whom this well known verse is recited; "There never
was beheld on earth a sacrifice equal to the sacrifice of Marutta: all
the implements

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

and utensils were made of gold. Indra was intoxicated with the libations
of Soma juice, and the Brahmans were enraptured with the magnificent
donations they received. The winds of heaven encompassed the rite as
guards, and the assembled gods attended to behold it <span
id="fr_935"></span>[20](#fn_935.md)." Marutta was a Chakravarttí, or
universal monarch: he had a son named Narishyanta <span
id="fr_936"></span>[21](#fn_936.md); his son was Dama <span
id="fr_937"></span>[22](#fn_937.md); his son was Rájyavarddhana; his son
was Sudhriti; his son was Nara; his son was Kevala; his son was
Bandhumat; his son was Vegavat; his son was Budha <span
id="fr_938"></span>[23](#fn_938.md); his son was Trinavindu, who had a
daughter named Ilavilá <span id="fr_939"></span>[24](#fn_939.md). The
celestial nymph Alambushá becoming enamoured of Trińavindu, bore him a
son named Viśála, by whom the city Vaisáli was founded <span
id="fr_940"></span>[25](#fn_940.md).

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

The son of the first king of Vaiśálí was Hemachandra; his son was
Suchandra; his son was Dhúmráśwa; his son was Srinjaya <span
id="fr_941"></span>[26](#fn_941.md); his son was Sahadeva <span
id="fr_942"></span>[27](#fn_942.md); his son was Kriśáśwa; his son was
Somadatta, who celebrated ten times the sacrifice of a horse; his son
was Janamejaya; and his son was Sumati <span
id="fr_943"></span>[28](#fn_943.md). These were the kings of Vaiśálí; of
whom [it](errata.htm#17.md) is said, "By the favour of Trińavindu all the
monarchs of Vaiśálí were long lived, magnanimous, equitable, and
valiant."

Śaryáti, the fourth son of the Manu, had a daughter named Sukanyá, who
was married to the holy sage Chyavana <span
id="fr_944"></span>[29](#fn_944.md): he had also a righteous son, called
Ánartta. The son of the latter was Revata <span
id="fr_945"></span>[30](#fn_945.md), who ruled over

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

the country called after his father Ánartta, and dwelt at the capital
denominated Kuśasthalí <span id="fr_946"></span>[31](#fn_946.md). The son
of this prince was Raivata or Kakudmín, the eldest of a hundred
brethren. He had a very lovely daughter, and not finding any one worthy
of her hand, he repaired with her to the region of Brahmá to consult the
god where a fit bridegroom was to be met with. When he arrived, the
quiristers Háhá, Húhú, and others, were singing before Brahmá; and
Raivata, waiting till they had finished, imagined the ages that elapsed
during their performance to be but as a moment. At the end of their
singing, Raivata prostrated himself before Brahmá, and explained his
errand. "Whom should you wish for a son-in-law?" demanded Brahmá; and
the king mentioned to him various persons with whom he could be well
pleased. Nodding his head gently, and graciously smiling, Brahmá said to
him, "Of those whom you have named the third or fourth generation no
longer survives, for many successions of ages have passed away whilst
you were listening to our songsters: now upon earth the twenty-eighth
great age of the present Manu is nearly finished, and the Kali period is
at hand. You must therefore bestow this virgin gem upon some other
husband, for you are now alone, and your friends, your ministers,
servants, wife, kinsmen, armies, and treasures, have long since been
swept away by the hand of time." Overcome with astonishment and alarm,
the Rája then said to Brahmá, "Since I am thus circumstanced, do thou,
lord, tell me unto whom the maiden shall be given:" and the creator of
the world, whose throne is the lotus, thus benignantly replied to the
prince, as he stood bowed and humble before him: "The being of whose
commencement, course, and termination, we are ignorant; the unborn and
omnipresent essence of all things; he whose real and infinite nature and
essence we do not know--is the supreme Vishńu. He is time, made up of
moments and hours and years; whose influence is the source of perpetual
change. He is the universal form of all things, from birth to death. He
is

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

eternal, without name or shape. Through the favour of that imperishable
being am I the agent of his power in creation: through his anger is
Rudra the destroyer of the world: and the cause of preservation,
Purusha, proceeds also from him. The unborn having assumed my person
creates the world; in his own essence he provides for its duration; in
the form of Rudra he devours all things; and with the body of Ananta he
upholds them. Impersonated as Indra and the other gods he is the
guardian of mankind; and as the sun and moon he disperses darkness.
Taking upon himself the nature of fire he bestows warmth and maturity;
and in the condition of the earth nourishes all beings. As one with air
he gives activity to existence; and as one with water he satisfies all
wants: whilst in the state of ether, associated with universal
aggregation, he furnishes space for all objects. He is at once the
creator, and that which is created; the preserver, and that which is
preserved; the destroyer, and, as one with all things, that which is
destroyed; and, as the indestructible, he is distinct from these three
vicissitudes. In him is the world; he is the world; and he, the primeval
self-born, is again present in the world. That mighty Vishńu, who is
paramount over all beings, is now in a portion of himself upon the
earth. That city Kuśasthalí which was formerly your capital, and
rivalled the city of the immortals, is now known as Dwáraka <span
id="fr_947"></span>[32](#fn_947.md), and there reigns a portion of that
divine being in the person of Baladeva; to him, who appears as a man,
present her as a wife: he is a worthy bridegroom for this excellent
damsel, and she is a suitable bride for him."

Being thus instructed by the lotus-born divinity, Raivata returned with
his daughter to earth, where he found the race of men dwindled in
stature, reduced in vigour, and enfeebled in intellect. Repairing to the
city of Kuśasthalí, which he found much altered, the wise monarch
bestowed his unequalled daughter on the wielder of the ploughshare,
whose breast was as fair and radiant as crystal. Beholding the damsel

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

of excessively lofty height, the chief, whose banner is a palm-tree,
shortened her with the end of his ploughshare, and she became his wife.
Balaráma having espoused, agreeably to the ritual, Revatí, the daughter
of Raivata, the king retired to the mountain Himálaya, and ended his
days in devout austerities <span id="fr_948"></span>[33](#fn_948.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_916"></span>[347:1](vp093.htm#fr_916.md) The complete series
of the different dynasties is found elsewhere only in the Váyu, the
Brahmáńd́a (which is the same), the Matsya, and the Bhágavata Puráńas.
The Bráhma P. and the Hari Vanśa, the Agni, Linga, Kúrma, and Garud́a
Puráńas have lists of various extent, but none beyond the families of
Páńd́u and Krishńa. The Márkańd́eya contains an account of a few of the
kings of the solar dynasty alone; and the Padma, of a part of the solar
and lunar princes only, besides accounts of individuals. In the
Rámáyańa, Mahábhárata, and in the other Puráńas, occasional short
genealogies and notices of individual princes occur. In general there is
a tolerable conformity, but this is not invariably the case, as we shall
have occasion to observe.

<span id="fn_917"></span>[348:2](vp093.htm#fr_917.md) In the historical
passages of all the Puráńas in which such occur, and especially in the
Vishńu and Váyu, verses, apparently the fragments of a more ancient
narrative, are frequently cited. It may also be noticed, as a
peculiarity of this part of the Puráńa, that the narration is in prose.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[348:3](vp093.htm#fr_918.md) Daksha is elsewhere
said to have been one of the mind-born sons of Brahmá, or to have been
the son of the Prachetasas: see [p. 115](vp050.htm#page_115.md). n.
[5](vp050.htm#fn_282.md).

<span id="fn_919"></span>[348:4](vp093.htm#fr_919.md) According to the
nomenclature sometimes followed, and as we shall have reason to conclude
intended in this place, there are ten sons of Manu. The commentator
regards them, however, as but nine, considering Nabhága-nedisht́a but one
name, or Nedisht́a the father of Nábhága. The number is generally stated
to be nine, although there is some variety in the names, particularly in
this name, which occurs Nábhágadisht́a, Nábhágarisht́ha; and also
separated, as Nábhága, Nabhaga, or Nabhága; Nedisht́a, Disht́a, and
Arisht́a: the latter, as in the Kúrma, distinctly stated, \#\#\#. Again,
\#\#\# Bráhma P. The commentator on the Hari Vanśa quotes the Vedas for
Nábhágadisht́a: \#\#\# but the name occurs as Nábhánedisht́ha in the
Aitareya Bráhmańa of the Rigveda, where a story is told of his being
excluded from all share of his inheritance, on the plea of his being
wholly devoted to a religious life. See also As. Res. VIII. 384. The
name as ordinarily written, Na-bhága, 'no-share,' has nevertheless an
obvious connexion with the legend. The name of Nriga is found only in
our text, the Padma, and the Bhágavata: the Váyu has Najava. Pránśu is
also the reading of the Váyu and Agni, but not of the rest, which have
Veńa, Vanya, Dańd́a, Kuśanábha or Kavi, in its place. The Mahábhárata,
Adi P., p. 113, has Veńa, Dhrishńu, Narishyanta, Nábhága, Ikshwáku,
Kárúsha, Śaryáti, Ilá, Prishadhra, and Nábhágárisht́a. The Padma P., in
the Pátála Khańd́a, says there were 'ten,' and names them Ikshwáku,
Nriga, Disht́a, Dhrisht́a, Karúsha, Śaryáti, Narishyanta, Prishadhra,
Nábhága, and Kavi.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[349:5](vp093.htm#fr_920.md) 'That sacrifice being
wrongly offered, through the improper invocations of the Hotri.' It is
also read 'frustrated.' This is rather a brief and obscure allusion to
what appears to be an ancient legend, and one that has undergone various
modifications. According to the Matsya, no change of sex took place in
the first instance. The eldest son of Manu was Ida or Ila, whom his
father appointed sovereign of the seven Dwípas. In his progress round
his dominions, Ila came to the forest of Śambhu or Śiva; entering into
which, he was changed to a female, Ilá, agreeably to a promise made
formerly by Śiva to Párvatí, who had been once unseasonably broken in
upon by some sages, that such a transformation should be inflicted on
every male who trespassed upon the sacred grove. After a season, the
brothers of Ila sought for him, and finding him thus metamorphosed,
applied to Vaśisht́ha, their father's priest, to know the cause. He
explained it to them, and directed them to worship Śiva and his bride.
They did so, accordingly; and it was announced by the deities, that,
upon the performance of an Aśwamedha by Ikshwáku, Ila should become a
Kimpurusha, named Sudyumna, and that he should be a male one month, and
a female another month, alternately. The Váyu, which is followed by most
of the other authorities, states, that upon Manu's offering their share
of the sacrifice to Mitra and Varuńa, instead of a boy, a girl was born:
according to the Vedas. Manu desired her to follow him; whence her name
Ilá (from ila or id́a, 'come'. There, however, Manu propitiates Mitra and
Varuńa, and the girl Ilá is changed into the boy Ila or Sudyumna by
their favour: as the Márkańd́eya. Sudyumna's subsequent change to a
female again, is told much as in the Matsya; but his being alternately
male and female is not mentioned in the Váyu any more than it is in our
text. The Bhágavata agrees in that respect with the Matsya, but it has
evidently embellished the earlier part of the legend by the introduction
of another character, Śraddhá, the wife of the Manu. It is said that it
was by her instigation, as she was desirous of having a girl, that the
ministering Brahmans altered the purpose of the rite, in consequence of
which a girl, instead of a boy, was born. The similarity of the name has
induced the learned author of the Origin of Pagan Idolatry to conceive
that he has found the Ila of the Hindus in the Il or Ilus of the
Phœnicians. "The Phœnician Il is the masculine Ila of the Hindus and
Indo-Scythæ, and Ila was a title of Manu or Buddha, who was preserved in
the ark at the time of the deluge:" I. 156: and he thence concludes that
Ila must be Noah; whilst other circumstances in his Phœnician history
identify <span id="page_350">p. 350</span> him with Abraham. I. 159.
Again; "Ilus or Il is a regular Cuthic name of Buddha, which the
Phœnicians, I have no doubt, brought with them; for Buddha or Manu, in
the character of Ina, is said to have married his own daughter, who is
described as the offspring of an ancient personage that was preserved in
an ark at the time of the deluge." I. 223. Now whatever connexion there
may be between the names of Ila, Il, Ilus, Ilium, Ilá 'the earth,' and
Ilos 'slime,' there is no very obvious resemblance between the Pauráńik
legends of Ilá and the Mosaic record; nor do the former authorize the
particulars of Ina stated by Mr. Faber, on the authority probably of
Col. Wilford. The Manu Satyavrata, who was preserved in the ark, is
never called Ila, nor is he the father of Ilá. Buddha was not so
preserved, nor is Ila ever a title of Buddha. Budha (not Buddha), the
husband of Ilá, never appears as her father, nor is he a Manu, nor is
she the daughter of any ancient personage preserved in an ark. There is
not therefore, as far as I am aware, any circumstance in the history of
Ila or Ilá which can identify either with Abraham or Noah.

<span id="fn_921"></span>[350:6](vp093.htm#fr_921.md) The Matsya calls the
name of the third Haritáśwa; the Váyu &c., Vinatáśwa; the Márkańd́eya,
Vinaya; and the Bhágavata, Vimala. All but the last agree in stating
that Utkala (Orissa) and Gaya in Behar are named after the two first.
The Matsya calls the third the sovereign of the east, along with the
Kauravas; the Váyu makes him king of the west. The Bhágavata calls them
all three rulers of the south.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[350:7](vp093.htm#fr_922.md) The authorities agree
in this location of Sudyumna. Pratisht́hána was situated on the eastern
side of the confluence of the Ganges and Jumna; the country between
which rivers was the territory of the direct male descendants of
Vaivaswata. In the Hari Vaasa it is said that he <span id="page_351">p.
351</span> reigned in Pratisht́hána, having killed Dhrisht́aka, Ambarísha,
and Dańd́a. M. Langlois had no doubt 79-4: in his copy, as he renders it,
'Il donna naissance à trois enfans;' though, as he observes, Hamilton
had called these the sons of Ikshwáku. The Bráhma P. has not this
passage, nor does the commentator on the Hari Vanśa give any
explanation; neither does any thing of the kind occur elsewhere. We have
however, subsequently in the text, Dańd́a named as a son of Ikshwáku; and
in the Padma P., Srisht́i Khańd́a, and in the Uttara Khańd́a of the
[Rámáyáńa](errata.htm#16.md), we have a detailed narrative of Dańd́a, the
son of Ikshwáku, whose country was laid waste by an imprecation of
Bhárgava, whose daughter that prince had violated. His kingdom became in
consequence the Dańd́aka forest. The Mahábhárata, Dána Dharma, alludes to
the same story. If therefore the preferable reading of the Hari Vanśa be
Suta, 'son,' it is at variance with all other authorities. At the same
time it must be admitted, that the same work is singular in asserting
any collision between Dańd́a and his brothers and Sudyumna, and the
passage seems to have grown out of that careless and ignorant
compilation which the Hari Vanśa so perpetually presents. It is not
improbably a gratuitous perversion of this passage in the Matsya;
'Ambarísha was the son of Nábhága; and Dhrisht́a had three sons.'

<span id="fn_923"></span>[351:8](vp093.htm#fr_923.md) This story has been
modified apparently at different periods, according to a progressive
horror of the crime. Our text simply states the fact. The Váyu says he
was hungry, and not only killed, but ate the cow of his spiritual
preceptor, Chyavana. In the Márkańd́eya he is described as being out a
hunting, and killing the cow of the father of Bábhravya, mistaking it
for a Gavaya or Gayal. The Bhágavata, as usual, improves upon the story,
and says that Prishadhra was appointed by his Guru Vaśisht́ha to protect
his cattle. In the night a tiger made his way into the fold, and the
prince in his haste, and in the dark, killed the cow upon which he had
fastened, instead of the tiger. In all the authorities the effect is the
same, and the imprecation of the offended sage degraded Prishadhra to
the caste of a Śúdra. According to the Bhágavata, the prince led a life
of devotion, and perishing in the flame of a forest, obtained final
liberation. The obvious purport of this legend, and of some that follow,
is to account for the origin of the different castes from one common
ancestor.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[351:9](vp093.htm#fr_924.md) The Bhágavata also
places the Kárúshas in the north; but the country of the Kárúshas is
usually placed upon the Parípátra or Vindhya mountains (see [p.
186](vp061.htm#page_186). n. [13](vp061.htm#fn_489).md).

<span id="fn_925"></span>[352:10](vp093.htm#fr_925.md) The Váyu has
Nábhága, the son of Arisht́a; the Márkańd́eya has, the son of Disht́a; the
Bhágavata also calls him the son of Disht́a. According to that authority,
he became a Vaiśya by his actions. The other Puráńas generally agree
that the descendants of this person became Vaiśyas; but the Matsya and
Váyu do not notice it. The Márkańd́eya details a story of Nábhága's
carrying off and marrying the daughter of a Vaiśya; in consequence of
which he was degraded, it is said, to the same caste, and deprived of
his share of the patrimonial sovereignty, which his son and successor
recovered. The Bráhma P. and Hari Vanśa assert that two sons of
Nábhágárisht́a again became Brahmans; but the duties of royalty imply the
Kshatriya caste of his posterity; and the commentator on our text
observes that the son of Nábhága was born before his father's
degradation, and consequently the race continued Kshatriya; an assertion
unsupported by any authority, and it must therefore appear that .a race
of Vaiśya princes was recognised by early traditions.

or Subaláśwa, according to the Márkańd́eya, which explains his name
Karandhama to denote his creation of an army, when besieged by his
revolted tributaries, by breathing on his hands.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[352:19](vp093.htm#fr_934.md) Both forms occur, as
the commentator observes. The Márkańd́eya has a long story of this
prince's carrying off the daughter of Viśála, king of Vaidiśa. Being
attacked and captured by his confederated rivals, he was rescued by his
father, but was so much mortified by his disgrace, that he vowed never
to marry nor reign. The princess, also becoming an ascetic, met with him
in the woods, and they were finally espoused; but Avikshit kept his
other vow, and relinquished his succession in favour of his son, who
succeeded to the kingdoms of both Karandhama and Viśála,

<span id="fn_935"></span>[353:20](vp093.htm#fr_935.md) Most of our
authorities quote the same words, with or without addition. The Váyu
adds, that the sacrifice was conducted by Samvartta, whom the Bhágavata
terms a Yogi, the son of Angiras; and that Vrihaspati was so jealous of
the splendour of the rite, that a great quarrel ensued between him and
Samvartta. How it involved the king is not told, but apparently in
consequence, Marutta, with his kindred and friends, was taken by
Samvartta to heaven. According to the Márkańd́eya, Marutta was so named
from the paternal benediction, 'May the winds be thine,' or 'be
propitious to thee.' He reigned, agreeably to that record, 85000 years.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[353:21](vp093.htm#fr_936.md) Omitted in the
Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[353:22](vp093.htm#fr_937.md) A rather chivalric
and curious story is told of Dama in the Márkańd́eya. His bride Sumaná,
daughter of the king Daśárha, was rescued by him from his rivals. One of
them, Bapushmat, afterwards killed Marutta, who had retired into the
woods, after relinquishing his crown to his son. Dama in retaliation
killed Bapushmat, and made the Pińd́a, or obsequial offering to his
father, of his flesh: with the remainder he fed the Brahmans of Rákshasa
origin: such were the kings of the solar race.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[353:23](vp093.htm#fr_938.md) The Bhágavata has
Bandhavat, Oghavat, and Bandha.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[353:24](vp093.htm#fr_939.md) The Váyu and
Bhágavata both add that she was the wife of Viśravas, and mother of
Kuvera. In the Linga P. she is said to have been the wife of Pulastya,
and mother of Viśravas. The weight of authority is in favour of the
former statement. See [p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83.md). n.
[5](vp045.htm#fn_244.md).

<span id="fn_940"></span>[353:25](vp093.htm#fr_940.md) The Bhágavata names
three sons, Viśála, Śúnyabandhu, and Dhúmaketu. Vaiśálí is a city of
considerable renown in Indian tradition, but its site is a subject of
some uncertainty. Part of the difficulty arises from confounding it with
Viśálá, another name of Ujayin; \#\#\# Hemachandra. Also in the Megha
Dúta; 'Having arrived at Avanti, proceed to the illustrious city before
indicated, <span id="page_354">p. 354</span> Viśálá.' 'To the city
Ujjayiní, named Viśálá. Comment. Vaiśálí however appears to be very
differently situated. According to the Buddhists, amongst whom it is
celebrated as a chief seat of the labours of Śákhya and his first
disciples, it is the same as Prayága or Allahabad; but the Rámáyańa (I.
45) places it much lower down, on the north bank of the Ganges, nearly
opposite to the mouth of the Sone; and it was therefore in the modern
district of Sáran, as Hamilton (Genealogies of the Hindus) conjectured.
In the fourth century it was known to the Chinese traveller Fa-hian as
Phi-she-li, on the right bank of the Gandak, not far from its confluence
with the Ganges. Account of the Foe-küe-ki: Trans. R. As. Soc. no. IX.
p. 128.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[354:26](vp093.htm#fr_941.md) Dhumráksha and
Samyama: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[354:27](vp093.htm#fr_942.md) The text is clear
enough; but, as elsewhere noticed (Hindu Theatre, II. 296), the
commentator on the Bhágavata interprets the parallel passage, very
differently, or 'Kriśáśwa with Devaja,' or, as some copies read, Devaka
or Daivata, as if there were two sons of Samyama.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[354:28](vp093.htm#fr_943.md) The Bhágavata
changes the order of these two, making Janamejaya the son of Sumati; or
Pramati, Váyu. Sumati, king of Vaiśálí, is made cotemporary with Ráma:
Rámáyańa, I.47. 17. The dynasty of Vaiśála kings is found only in our
text, the Váyu, and Bhágavata. Hamilton places them from 1920 to 1240 B.
C.; but the latter is incompatible with the date he assigns to Ráma, of
1700 B. C. The co-temporary existence of Sumati and Ráma, however, is
rather unintelligible, as, according to our lists, the former is the
thirty-fourth, and the latter the sixtieth, from Vaivaswata Manu.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[354:29](vp093.htm#fr_944.md) The circumstances of
their marriage, of Chyavana's appropriating a share of offerings to the
Aswiní Kumáras, and of sis quarrel with Indra in consequence, are old in
detail in the Bhágavata and Padma Puráńas.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[354:30](vp093.htm#fr_945.md) In most of the other
Puráńas, Reva or Raiva. The Linga and Matsya insert Rochamána before
him; and the Bhágavata adds to Ánartta, Uttánavarhish and Bhúrisheńa.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[355:31](vp093.htm#fr_946.md) The Bhágavata
ascribes the foundation of Kuśasthalí to Revata, who built it, it is
said, within the sea. The subsequent legend shews that it was the same,
or on the same spot, as Dwáraká; and Ánartta was therefore part of Cutch
or Guzerat. See [p. 190](vp061.htm#page_190). n. [77](vp061.htm#fn_553.md).

<span id="fn_947"></span>[356:32](vp093.htm#fr_947.md) So called from its
many Dwáras or gateways: \#\#\# Váyu.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[357:33](vp093.htm#fr_948.md) The object of this
legend, which is told by most of the authorities, is obviously to
account for the anachronism of making Balaráma cotemporary with Raivata;
the one early in the Treta age, and the other at the close of the
Dwápara.
