### LEGEND OF PARAŚURÁMA.

(From the Mahábhárata.)

"JAMADAGNI (the son of Richíka <span id="fr_1060"></span>[15](#fn_1060).md)
was a pious sage, who by the fervour of his devotions, whilst engaged in
holy study, obtained entire possession of the Vedas. Having gone to king
Prasenajit, he demanded in marriage his daughter Reńuká, and the king
gave her unto him. The descendant of Bhrigu conducted the princess to
his hermitage, and dwelt with her there, and she was contented to
partake in his ascetic life. They had four sons, and then a fifth, who
was Jámadagnya, the last but not the least of the brethren, Once when
her sons were all absent, to gather the fruits on which they fed,
Reńuká, who was exact in the discharge of all her duties, went forth to
bathe. On her way to the stream she beheld Chitraratha, the prince of
Mrittikávatí, with a garland of lotuses on his neck, sporting with his
queen in the water, and she felt envious of their felicity. Defiled by
unworthy thoughts, wetted but not purified by the stream, she returned
disquieted to the hermitage, and her husband perceived her agitation.
Beholding her fallen from perfection, and shorn of the lustre of her
sanctity, Jamadagni reproved her, and was exceeding wroth. Upon this
there came her sons from the wood, first the eldest, Rumańwat, then
Susheńa, then Vasu, and then Viśwavasu; and each, as he entered, was
successively commanded by his father to put his mother to death; but
amazed, and influenced by natural affection, neither of them made any
reply: therefore Jamadagni was angry, and cursed them, and they became
as idiots, and lost all

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

understanding, and were like unto beasts or birds. Lastly, Ráma returned
to the hermitage, when the mighty and holy Jamadagni said unto him,
'Kill thy mother, who has sinned; and do it, son, without repining.'
Ráma accordingly took up his axe, and struck off his mother's head;
whereupon the wrath of the illustrious and mighty Jamadagni was
assuaged, and he was pleased with his son, and said, 'Since thou hast
obeyed my commands, and done what was hard to be performed, demand from
me whatever blessings thou wilt, and thy desires shall be all
fulfilled.' Then Ráma begged of his father these boons; the restoration
of his mother to life, with forgetfulness of her having been slain, and
purification from all defilement; the return of his brothers to their
natural condition; and, for himself, invincibility in single combat, and
length of days: and all these did his father bestow.

"It happened on one occasion, that, during the absence of the Rishi's
sons, the mighty monarch Kárttavírya, the sovereign of the Haihaya
tribe, endowed by the favour of Dattátreya with a thousand arms, and a
golden chariot that went wheresoever he willed it to go, came to the
hermitage <span id="fr_1061"></span>[16](#fn_1061.md) of Jamadagni, where
the wife of the sage received him with all proper respect. The king,
inflated with the pride of valour, made no return to her hospitality,
but carried off with him by violence the calf of the milch cow of the
sacred oblation <span id="fr_1062"></span>[17](#fn_1062.md), and cast down
the tall trees surrounding the hermitage. When Ráma returned, his father
told him what had chanced, and he saw the cow in affliction, and he was
filled with wrath. Taking up his splendid bow <span
id="fr_1063"></span>[18](#fn_1063.md), Bhárgava, the slayer of hostile
heroes, assailed Kárttavírya, who had now become subject to

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

the power of death, and overthrew him in battle. With sharp arrows Ráma
cut off his thousand arms, and the king perished. The sons of
Kárttavírya, to revenge his death, attacked the hermitage of Jamadagni,
when Ráma was away, and slew the pious and unresisting sage, who called
repeatedly, but fruitlessly, upon his valiant son. They then departed;
and when Ráma returned, bearing fuel from the thickets, he found his
father lifeless, and thus bewailed his unmerited fate: 'Father, in
resentment of my actions have you been murdered by wretches as foolish
as they are base! by the sons of Kárttavírya are you struck down, as a
deer in the forest by the huntsman's shafts! Ill have you deserved such
a death; you who have ever trodden the path of virtue, and never offered
wrong to any created thing! How great is the crime that they have
committed, in slaying with their deadly shafts an old man like you,
wholly occupied with pious cares, and engaging not in strife! Much have
they to boast of to their fellows and their friends, that they have
shamelessly slain a solitary hermit, incapable of contending in arms!'
Thus lamenting, bitterly and repeatedly, Ráma performed his father's
last obsequies, and lighted his funeral pile. He then made a vow that he
would extirpate the whole Kshatriya race. In fulfilment of this purpose
he took up his arms, and with remorseless and fatal rage singly
destroyed in fight the sons of Kárttavírya; and after them, whatever
Kshatriyas he encountered, Ráma, the first of warriors, likewise slew.
Thrice seven times did the clear the earth of the Kshatriya caste <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[19](#fn_1064.md); and he filled with their blood the
five large lakes of Samanta-panchaka, from which he offered libations to
the race of Bhrigu. There did he behold his sire again, and the son of
Richíka beheld his son, and told him what to do. Offering a solemn
sacrifice to the king of the gods, Jámadagnya presented the earth to the
ministering priests. To Kaśyapa he gave the altar made of gold, ten
fathoms in length, and nine in height <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[20](#fn_1065.md). With the permission of Kaśyapa, the
Brahmans divided it in pieces amongst them, and they were thence

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

called Khańd́aváyana Brahmans. Having given the earth to Kaśyapa, the
hero of immeasurable prowess retired to the Mahendra mountain, where he
still resides: and in this manner was there enmity between him and the
race of Kshatriyas, and thus was the whole earth conquered by Ráma <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[21](#fn_1066.md)."

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The son of Viswámitra was Śunahśephas, the descendant of Bhrigu, given
by the gods, and thence named Devaráta <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[22](#fn_1067.md). Viswámitra had

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

other sons also, amongst whom the most celebrated were Madhuchhandas,
Kritajaya, Devadeva, Asht́aka, Kachchapa, and Hárita; these founded many
families, all of whom were known by the name of Kauśikas, and
intermarried with the families of various Rishis <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[23](#fn_1068.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[401:15](vp100.htm#fr_1060.md) The circumstances
of Richíka's marriage, and the birth of Jamadagni and Viśwámitra, are
told much in the same manner as in our text both in the Mahábhárata and
Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[402:16](vp100.htm#fr_1061.md) In the beginning
of the legend occurs the account of Kárttavíryárjuna, with the addition
that he oppressed both men and gods. The latter applying to Vishńu for
succour, he descended to earth, and was born as Paraśuráma, for the
especial purpose of putting the Haihaya king to death.

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[402:17](vp100.htm#fr_1062.md) In the Rájadharma
the sons of the king carry off the calf. The Bhágavata makes the king
seize upon the cow, by whose aid Jamadagni had previously entertained
Arjuna and all his train: borrowing, no doubt, these embellishments from
the similar legend of Vaśisht́ha and Viśwámitra, related in the Rámáyańa.

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[402:18](vp100.htm#fr_1063.md) The characteristic
weapon of Ráma is however an axe (paraśu), whence his name Ráma, 'with
the axe.' It was given to him by Śiva, whom the hero propitiated on
mount Gandhamádana. He at the same time received instruction in the use
of weapons generally, and the art of war. Rája Dharma.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[403:19](vp100.htm#fr_1064.md) This more than
'thrice slaying of the slain' is explained in the Rájadharma to mean,
that he killed the men of so many generations, as fast as they grew up
to adolescence.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[403:20](vp100.htm#fr_1065.md) It is sometimes
read Narotsedha, 'as high as a man.'

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[404:21](vp100.htm#fr_1066.md) The story, as told
in the Rájadharma section, adds, that when Ráma had given the earth to
Kaśyapa, the latter desired him to depart, as there was no dwelling for
him in it, and to repair to the seashore of the south, where Ocean made
for him (or relinquished to him) the maritime district named Śúrpáraka.
The traditions of the Peninsula ascribe the formation of the coast of
Malabar to this origin, and relate that Paraśuráma compelled the ocean
to retire, and introduced Brahmans and colonists from the north into
Kerala or Malabar. According to some accounts he stood on the promontory
of Dilli, and shot his arrows to the south, over the site of Kerala. It
seems likely that we have proof of the local legend being at least as
old as the beginning of the Christian era, as the mons Pyrrhus of
Ptolemy is probably the mountain of Paraśu or Paraśuráma. See Catalogue
of Mackenzie Collection, Introd. p. xcv. and vol. II. p. 74. The
Rájadharma also gives an account of the Kshatriyas who escaped even the
thrice seven times repeated destruction of their race. Some of the
Haihayas were concealed by the earth as women; the son of Viduratha, of
the race of Puru, was preserved in the Riksha mountain, where he was
nourished by the bears; Sarvakarman, the son of Saudása, was saved by
Paráśara, performing the offices of a Śúdra; Gopati, son of Śivi, was
nourished by cows in the forests; Vatsa, the son of Pratarddana, was
concealed amongst the calves in a cow-pen; the son of Deviratha was
secreted by Gautama on the banks of the Ganges; Vrihadratha was
preserved in Gridhrakúta; and descendants of Marutta were saved by the
ocean. From these the lines of kings were continued; but it does not
appear from the ordinary lists that they were ever interrupted. This
legend however, as well as that of the Rámáyańa, b. I. c. 52, no doubt
intimates a violent and protracted struggle between the Brahmans and
Kshatriyas for supreme domination in India, as indeed the text of the
Mahábhárata more plainly denotes, as Earth is made to say to Kaśyapa,
'The fathers and grandfathers of these Kshatriyas have been killed by
the remorseless Ráma in warfare on my account.'

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[404:22](vp100.htm#fr_1067.md) The story of
Śunahśephas is told by different authorities, with several variations.
As the author of various Śúktas in the Rich, he is called the son of
Ajigartta. The Rámáyańa makes him the middle son of the sage Richíka,
sold to Ambarísha, king of Ayodhyá, by his parents, to be a victim in a
human sacrifice offered <span id="page_405">p. 405</span> by that
prince. He is set at liberty by Viśwámitra, but it is not added that he
was adopted. The Bhágavata concurs in the adoption, but makes
Śunahśephas the son of Viśwámitra's sister, by Ajigartta of the line of
Bhrigu, and states his being purchased as a victim for the sacrifice of
Hariśchandra (see n. [9](vp095.htm#fn_979.md). [p.
372](vp095.htm#page_372).md). The Váyu makes him a son of Richíka, but
alludes to his being the victim at Hariśchandra's sacrifice. According
to the Rámáyańa, Viswámitra called upon his sons to take the place of
Śunahśephas, and on their refusing, degraded them to the condition of
Cháńd́álas. The Bhágavata says, that fifty only of the hundred sons of
Viswámitra were expelled their tribe, for refusing to acknowledge
Śunahśephas or Devaráta as their elder brother. The others consented;
and the Bhágavata expresses this; 'They said to the elder, profoundly
versed in the Mantras, We are your followers:' as the commentator;
\#\#\#. The Rámáyańa also observes, that Śunahśephas, when bound,
praised Indra with Richas or hymns of the Rig-veda. The origin of the
story therefore, whatever may be its correct version, must be referred
to the Vedas; and it evidently alludes to some innovation in the ritual,
adopted by a part only of the Kauśika families of Brahmans.

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[405:23](vp100.htm#fr_1068.md) The Bhágavata says
one hundred sons, besides Devaráta and others, as Asht́aka, Hárita, &c.
Much longer lists of names are given in the Váyu, Bhágavata, Bráhma, and
Hari V. The two latter specify the mothers. Thus Devaśravas, Kati (the
founder of the Kátyáyanas), and Hiranyáksha were sons of Śilavatí;
Reńuka, Gálava, Sankriti, Mudgala, Madhuchchandas, and Devala were sons
of Reńu; and Asht́aka, Kachchhapa, and Hárita were the sons of
Drishadvatí. The same works enumerate the Gotras, the families or tribes
of the Kauśika Brahmans: these are, Párthivas, Devarátas, Yájnawalkyas,
Sámarshanas, Údumbaras, Dumlánas, Tarakáyanas, Munchátas, Lohitas,
Renus, Karishus, Babhrus, Páninas, Dhyánajyápyas, Śyálantas,
Hiranyákshas, Śankus, Gálavas, Yamadútas, Devalas, Śálankáyanas,
Báshkalas, Dadativádaras, Śauśratas, Śaindhaváyanas, Nishńátas,
Chunchulas, Śálankrityas, Sankrityas, Vádarańyas, and an infinity of
others, multiplied by intermarriages with other tribes, and who,
according to the Váyu, were originally of the regal caste, like
Viswámitra; but, like him, obtained Brahmanhood through devotion. Now
these Gotras, or some of them at least, no doubt existed, partaking more
of the character of schools of doctrine, but in which teachers and
scholars were very likely to have become of one family by intermarrying;
and the whole, as well as their original founder, imply the interference
of the Kshatriya caste with the Brahmanical monopoly of religious
instruction and composition.
