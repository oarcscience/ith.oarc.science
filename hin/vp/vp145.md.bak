### CHAP. XXVIII.

Wives of Krishńa. Pradyumna has Aniruddha: nuptials of the latter.
Balaráma beat at dice, becomes incensed, and slays Rukmin and others.

RUKMINÍ bare to Krishńa these other sons, Chárudeshńa, Sudeshńa,
Chárudeha, Sushena, Chárugupta, Bhadracháru, Cháruvinda, Sucháru, and
the very mighty Cháru; also one daughter, Chárumatí. Krishńa had seven
other beautiful wives, Kálindí, Mitravrindá, the virtuous Nágnajití, the
queen Jámbavatí; Rohińí, of beautiful form; the amiable and excellent
daughter of the king of Madra, Mádrí; Satyabhámá, the daughter of
Śatrujit; and Lakshmańá, of lovely smiles <span
id="fr_1542"></span>[1](#fn_1542.md). Besides these, he had sixteen
thousand other wives <span id="fr_1543"></span>[2](#fn_1543.md).

<span id="page_579">p. 579</span>

The heroic Pradyumna was chosen for her lord, at her public choice of a
husband, by the daughter of Rukmin; and he had by her the powerful and
gallant prince Aniruddha, who was fierce in fight, an ocean of prowess,
and the tamer of his foes. Keśava demanded in marriage for him the
granddaughter of Rukmin; and although the latter was inimical to
Krishńa, he betrothed the maiden (who was his son's daughter) to the son
of his own daughter (her cousin Aniruddha). Upon the occasion of the
nuptials Ráma and other Yádavas attended Krishńa to Bhojakat́a, the city
of Rukmin. After the wedding had been solemnized, several of the kings,
headed by him of Kalinga, said to Rukmin, "This wielder of the
ploughshare is ignorant of the dice, which may be converted into his
misfortune: why may we not contend with him, and beat him, in play?" The
potent Rukmin replied to them, and said, "So let it be:" and he engaged
Balaráma at a game of dice in the palace. Balaráma soon lost to Rukmin a
thousand Nishkas <span id="fr_1544"></span>[3](#fn_1544.md): he then staked
and lost another thousand; and then pledged ten thousand, which Rukmin,
who was well skilled in gambling, also won. At this the king of Kalinga
laughed aloud, and the weak and exulting Rukmin grinned, and said,
"Baladeva is losing, for he knows nothing of the game; although, blinded
by a vain passion for play, he thinks he understands the dice."
Halayudha, galled by the broad laughter of the Kalinga prince, and the
contemptuous speech of Rukmin, was exceedingly angry, and, overcome with
passion, increased his stake to ten millions of Nishkas. Rukmin accepted
the challenge, and therefore threw the dice. Baladeva won, and cried
aloud, "The stake is mine." But Rukmin called out as loudly, that he was
the winner. "Tell no lies, Bala," said he: "the stake is yours; that is
true; but I did not agree to it: although this be won by you, yet still
I am the winner." A deep voice was then heard in the sky, inflaming
still more the anger of the high-spirited Baladeva, saying, "Bala has
rightly won the whole sum, and Rukmin speaks falsely: although he did

<span id="page_580">p. 580</span>

not accept the pledge in words, he did so by his acts (having cast the
dice)." Balaráma thus excited, his eyes red with rage, started up, and
struck Rukmin with the board on which the game was played, and killed
him <span id="fr_1545"></span>[4](#fn_1545.md). Taking hold of the
trembling king of Kalinga, he knocked out the teeth which he had shewn
when he laughed. Laying hold of a golden column, he dragged it from its
place, and used it as a weapon to kill those princes who had taken part
with his adversaries. Upon which the whole circle, crying out with
terror, took to flight, and escaped from the wrath of Baladeva. When
Krishńa heard that Rukmin had been killed by his brother, he made no
remark, being afraid of Rukminí on the one hand, and of Bala on the
other; but taking with him the newly wedded Aniruddha, and the Yádava
tribe, he returned to Dwáraká.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1542"></span>[578:1](vp145.htm#fr_1542.md) The number
specified, however, both in this place and in c. 32, is nine, instead of
eight. The commentator endeavours to explain the difference by
identifying Rohińí with Jámbavatí; but in the notices of Krishńa's
posterity, both in this work and in the Bhágavata, she is distinct from
Jámbavatí. She seems, however, to be an addition to the more usually
specified eight, of whose several marriages the Bhágavata gives the best
account. In addition to the three first, respecting whom particulars are
found in all, Kálindí, or the Yamuná, is the daughter of the sun, whom
Krishńa meets on one of his visits to Indraprastha, and who claims him
as the reward of her penance. His next wife, Mitravindá, is the daughter
of his maternal aunt, Rájádhideví ([p. 437](vp107.htm#page_437).md), and
sister of Vinda and Anuvinda, kings of Avantí: she chooses him at her
Swayambara. The Hari Vanśa calls her Saudattá, daughter of Śivi; and she
is subsequently termed Śaivyá by our text. Nágnajití or Satyá, the next
wife, was the daughter of Nagnajit, king of Kausála, and was the prize
of Krishńa's overcoming seven fierce bulls, whom no other hero had
encountered with success. Bhadrá, princess of Kekaya, also Krishńa's
cousin, the daughter of Śrutakírtti ([p. 437](vp107.htm#page_437).md), was
his next: and his eighth wife was Mádrí, the daughter of the king of
Madra; named, according to the Bhágavata, Lakshańá; and to the Hari V.,
Saubhímá; distinguishing, as does our text, clearly Lakshmańá from
Mádrí, and like it having no satisfactory equivalent for Bhadrá. The
Hari Vanśa does not name Rohińí, but specifies other names, as Vrihatí,
&c. In the life of Krishńa, taken from the Bhágavata through a Persian
translation, published by Maurice, there is a curious instance of the
barbarous distortion of Sanscrit names by the joint labours of the
English and Persian translators: the wives of Krishńa are written,
Rokemenee (Rukminí), Seteebhavani (Satyabhámá), Jamoometee (Jámbavatí),
Kalenderee (Kálindí), Lechmeena (Lakshmańá), Soeta (Satyá?), Bhedravatee
(Bhadrá), Mihrbenda (Mitravinda).

<span id="fn_1543"></span>[578:2](vp145.htm#fr_1543.md) These, according to
the Mahábhárata, <span id="page_579">p. 579</span> Ádi P., were
Apsarasas, or nymphs. In the Dána Dharma they become Krishńa's wives
through a boon given him by Umá.

<span id="fn_1544"></span>[579:3](vp145.htm#fr_1544.md) The Nishka is a
weight of gold, but according to different authorities of very different
amount. The commentator here terms it a weight of four Suvarńas, each
about 175 grains troy.

<span id="fn_1545"></span>[580:4](vp145.htm#fr_1545.md) The Bhágavata and
Hari Vanśa, which both tell this story, agree in the death of Rukmin;
but in the Mahábhárata he appears in the war, on the side of the
Pańd́avas. The occurrence is a not very favourable picture of courtly
manners; but scenes of violence have never been infrequent at the courts
of Rajput princes.
