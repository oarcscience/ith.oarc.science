### CHAP. IX.

Sports of the boys in the forest. Pralamba the Asura comes amongst them:
is destroyed by Ráma, at the command of Krishńa.

WHEN the demon in the form of an ass, and all his tribe, had been
destroyed, the grove of palms became the favourite resort of the Gopas
and their wives, and the sons of Vasudeva, greatly pleased, repaired to
the Bháńd́íra fig tree. They continued to wander about, shouting and
singing, and gathering fruits and flowers from the trees; now driving
the cows afar to pasture; now calling them by their names; now carrying
the foot-ropes of the kine upon their shoulders; now ornamenting
themselves with garlands of forest flowers, they looked like two young
bulls when the horns first appear. Attired the one in yellow, and the
other in sable garments, they looked like two clouds, one white, and one
black, surmounted by the bow of Indra. Sporting mutually with frolics
beneficial to the world, they roamed about like two monarchs over all
the collected sovereigns of the earth. Assuming human duties, and
maintaining the human character, they strayed through the thickets,
amusing themselves with sports suited to their mortal species and
condition, in swinging on the boughs of trees, or in boxing and
wrestling and hurling stones.

Having observed the two lads thus playing about, the Asura Pralamba,
seeking to devour them, came amongst the cowherd boys in the shape of
one of themselves, and mixed, without being suspected, in their
pastimes; for he thought, that, thus disguised, it would not be
difficult to find an opportunity to kill, first Krishńa, and afterwards
the son of Rohińí. The boys commenced playing at the game of leaping
like deer, two and two together <span id="fr_1482"></span>[1](#fn_1482.md).
Govinda was matched with Sridáman, and

<span id="page_519">p. 519</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Balaráma with
Pralamba: the other boys were coupled with one another, and went leaping
away. Govinda beat his companion, and Balaráma his; and the boys who
were on Krishńa's side were also victorious. Carrying one another, they
reached the Bháńd́íra fig; and from thence those who were victors were
conveyed back to the starting-ground by those who were vanquished. It
being Pralamba's duty to carry Sankarshana, the latter mounted upon his
shoulders, like the moon riding above a dark cloud; and the demon ran
off with him, but did not stop: finding himself, however, unable to bear
the weight of Balaráma, he enlarged his bulk, and looked like a black
cloud in the rainy season, Balaráma beholding him like a scorched
mountain, his head crowned with a diadem, and his neck hung round with
garlands, having eyes as large as cart wheels, a fearful form, and
shaking the earth with his tread, called out, as he was carried away, to
his brother, "Krishńa, Krishńa, I am carried off by some demon,
disguised as a cowherd, and huge as a mountain! What shall I do? Tell
me, Madhusúdana: the villain runs away with speed!" Krishńa opened his
mouth, smiling, for he well knew the might of the son of Rohińí, and
replied, "Why this subtle pretext of merely mortal nature? thou who art
the soul of all the most subtile of subtile things. Remember yourself,
the radical cause of the whole world; born before all cause, and all
that is alone when the world is destroyed. Dost thou not know that you
and I are alike the origin of the world, who have come down to lighten
its load? The heavens are thy head; the waters are thy body; earth is
thy feet; thy mouth is eternal fire; the moon is thy mind; the wind thy
breath; thy arms and hands are the four regions of space. Thou hast, O
mighty lord, a thousand heads, a thousand hands and feet and bodies; a
thousand Brahmás spring from thee, who art before all, and whom the
sages praise in myriads of forms. No one but I knoweth thy divine
person. Thy incarnate person is glorified by all the gods. Knowest thou
not, that, at the end of all, the universe disappears in thee? that,
upheld by thee, this

<span id="page_520">p. 520</span>

earth sustains living and inanimate things? and that, in the character
of uncreated time, with its divisions of ages, developed from an
instant, thou devourest the world? As the waters of the sea, when
swallowed up by submarine flame, are recovered by the winds, and thrown,
in the form of snow, upon the Himáchala, where coming into contact with
the rays of the sun, they reassume their watery nature <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[2](#fn_1483.md); so the world, being devoured by thee
at the period of dissolution, becomes of necessity, at the end of every
Kalpa, the world again, through thy creative efforts. Thou and I, soul
of the universe, are but one and the same cause of the creation of the
earth, although, for its protection, we exist in distinct individuals.
Calling to memory who thou art, O being of illimitable might, destroy of
thyself the demon. Suspending a while your mortal character, do what is
right."

Thus reminded by the magnanimous Krishńa, the powerful Baladeva laughed,
and squeezed Pralamba with his knees, striking him at the same time on
the head and face with his fists, so as to beat out both his

<span id="page_521">p. 521</span>

eyes. The demon, vomiting blood from his mouth, and having his brain
forced through the skull, fell upon the ground, and expired. The Gopas,
beholding Pralamba slain, were astonished, and rejoiced, and cried out,
"Well done," and praised Balaráma: and thus commended by his
playfellows, and accompanied by Krishńa, Bala, after the death of the
daitya Pralamba, returned to Gokula <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1482"></span>[518:1](vp126.htm#fr_1482.md) Jumping with both
feet at once, as deer bound, two boys together: the one that holds out
longest, or comes to a given point first, is the victor, and the
vanquished <span id="page_519">p. 519</span> is then bound to carry him
to the goal, if not already attained, and back again to the
starting-post, on his shoulders. The Bhágavata does not specify the
game, but mentions that the vanquished carry the victors on their backs.

<span id="fn_1483"></span>[520:2](vp126.htm#fr_1483.md) This passage is
read and explained differently in different copies. In some it is,
\#\#\#. And this is explained, 'The water of the ocean, devoured by the
fire called Vád́ava, becoming condensed, or in the form of dew or snow,
is seized by the wind called Kastaka, from which the Vád́ava fire has
departed, consisting of a pipe of the solar rays, and being placed in
the air, lies or is on the Himáchala,' &c. This is rather an awkward and
confused representation of the notion, and the other reading is somewhat
preferable: it consists simply in substituting \#\#\# for \#\#\# that
is, according to the commentary, 'The water devoured by the fire is
thrown by the wind Ka, made of a solar ray &c., on the Himáchala, where
it assumes the form of snow;' and so on. However disfigured by
inaccurate views of some of the instruments in operation, the physiology
is in the main very correct, and indicates accurate observation of
natural phenomena. The waters of the ocean, converted into vapour by
solar heat, are raised by the same influence into the air, and thence
borne by the winds to the summits of lofty mountain ranges, where they
are arrested by a diminished temperature, descend in the form of snow,
and again supply the streams that perpetually restore to the sea the
treasures of which it is as perpetually plundered.

<span id="fn_1484"></span>[521:3](vp126.htm#fr_1484.md) According to the
Hari Vanśa the gods themselves praised this proof of Ráma's strength
(bala), and hence he derived the name of Balaráma.
