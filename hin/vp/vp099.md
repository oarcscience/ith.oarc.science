### CHAP. VII.

Sons of Purúravas. Descendants of Amávasu. Indra born as Gádhí. Legend
of Richíka and Satyavatí. Birth of Jamadagni and Viśwámitra. Paraśuráma
the son of the former. (Legend of Paraśuráma.) Sunahśephas and others
the sons of Viśwámitra, forming the Kauśika race.

PURÚRAVAS had six sons, Áyus, Dhímat, Amávasu, Viśwavasu, Śatáyus, and
Śrutáyus <span id="fr_1046"></span>[1](#fn_1046). The son of Amávasu was
Bhíma <span id="fr_1047"></span>[2](#fn_1047); his son was
Kánchana <span id="fr_1048"></span>[3](#fn_1048); his son was
Suhotra <span id="fr_1049"></span>[4](#fn_1049), whose
[son](errata.htm#19) was Jahnu. This prince, whilst performing a
sacrifice, saw the whole of the place overflowed by the waters of the
Ganges. Highly offended at this intrusion, his eyes red with anger, he
united the spirit of sacrifice with himself, by the power of his
devotion, and drank up the river. The gods and sages upon this came to
him, and appeased his indignation, and reobtained Gangá from him, in the
capacity of his daughter (whence she is called Jáhnaví) <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[5](#fn_1050).

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

The son of Jahnu was Sumantu <span id="fr_1051"></span>[6](#fn_1051);
his son was Ajaka; his son was Valákáśwa <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[7](#fn_1052); his son was Kuśá <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[8](#fn_1053), who had four sons, Kuśámba,
Kuśanábha, Amúrttaya, and Amávasu <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[9](#fn_1054). Kuśámba, being desirous of a son,
engaged in devout penance to obtain one who should be equal to Indra.
Observing the intensity of his devotions, Indra was alarmed lest a
prince of power like his own should be engendered, and determined
therefore to take upon himself the character of Kuśámba's son <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[10](#fn_1055). He was accordingly born as Gádhi, of
the race of Kuśa (Kauśika). Gádhi had a daughter named Satyavatí.
Richíka, of the descendants of Bhrigu, demanded her in marriage. The
king was very unwilling to give his daughter to a peevish old Brahman,
and demanded of him, as the nuptial present, a thousand fleet horses,
whose colour should be white, with one black ear. Richíka having
propitiated Varuńa, the god of ocean, obtained from him, at the holy
place called Aśwatírtha, a thousand such steeds; and giving them to the
king, espoused his daughter <span id="fr_1056"></span>[11](#fn_1056).

In order to effect the birth of a son, Richíka <span
id="fr_1057"></span>[12](#fn_1057) prepared a dish of rice, barley, and
pulse, with butter and milk, for his wife to eat; and at her

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

request he consecrated a similar mixture for her mother, by partaking of
which she should give birth to a prince of martial prowess. Leaving both
dishes with his wife, after describing particularly which was intended
for her, and which for her mother, the sage went forth to the forests.
When the time arrived for the food to be eaten, the queen said to
Satyavatí, "Daughter, all persons wish their children to be possessed of
excellent qualities, and would be mortified to see them surpassed by the
merits of their mother's brother. It will be desirable for you,
therefore, to give me the mess your husband has set apart for you, and
to eat of that intended for me; for the son which it is to procure me is
destined to be the monarch of the whole world, whilst that which your
dish would give you must be a Brahman, alike devoid of affluence,
valour, and power." Satyavatí agreed to her mother's proposal, and they
exchanged messes.

When Richíka returned home, and beheld Satyavatí, he said to her,
"Sinful woman, what hast thou done! I view thy body of a fearful
appearance. Of a surety thou hast eaten the consecrated food which was
prepared for thy mother: thou hast done wrong. In that food I had
infused the properties of power and strength and heroism; in thine, the
qualities suited to a Brahman, gentleness, knowledge, and resignation.
In consequence of having reversed my plans, thy son shall follow a
warrior's propensities, and use weapons, and fight, and slay. Thy
mother's son shall be born with the inclinations of a Brahman, and be
addicted to peace and piety." Satyavatí, hearing this, fell at her
husband's feet, and said, "My lord, I have done this thing through
ignorance; have compassion on me; let me not have a son such as thou
hast foretold: if such there must be, let it be my grandson, not my
son." The Muni, relenting at her distress, replied, "So let it be."
Accordingly in due season she gave birth to Jamadagni; and her mother
brought forth Viswamitra. Satyavatí afterwards became the Kauśikí
river <span id="fr_1058"></span>[13](#fn_1058). Jamadagni married
Reńuká, the daughter of Reńú, of the

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

family of Ikshwáku, and had by her the destroyer of the Kshatriya race,
Paraśuráma, who was a portion of Náráyańa, the spiritual guide of the
universe <span id="fr_1059"></span>[14](#fn_1059).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1046"></span>[398:1](vp099.htm#fr_1046) Considerable
variety prevails in these names, and the Matsya, Padma, Bráhma, and Agni
enumerate eight. The lists are as follows:

<div align="center">

|              |           |           |          |            |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Mahábhárata. | Matsya.   | Agni.     | Kúrma.   | Bhágavata. |
| Áyus         | Áyus      | Áyus      | Áyus     | Áyus       |
| Dhímat       | Dhritimat | Dhímat    | Máyus    | Śrutáyus   |
| Amávasu      | Vasu      | Vasu      | Amáyus   | Satyáyus   |
| Drid́háyus    | Drid́háyus | Uśráyus   | Viśwáyus | Ráya       |
| Vanáyus      | Dhanáyus  | Antáyus   | Śatáyus  | Vijaya     |
| Śatáyus      | Śatáyus   | Śatáyus   | Śrutáyus | Jaya       |
|              | Aśwáyus   | Ritáyus   |          |            |
|              | Divijáta  | Divijáta. |          |            |

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The list of the
Bráhma is that of the Mahábhárata, with the addition of Śatáyus and
Viśwáyus; and the Padma agrees with the Matsya.

<span id="fn_1047"></span>[398:2](vp099.htm#fr_1047) Son of Vijaya:
Bhágavata. This line of princes is followed only in our text, the Váyu,
Bráhma, and Hari V., and the Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[398:3](vp099.htm#fr_1048) Kánchanaprabha:
Bráhma.

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[398:4](vp099.htm#fr_1049) Hotraka: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[398:5](vp099.htm#fr_1050) The Bráhma P. and
Hari V. add of this prince, that he was the husband of Káverí, the
daughter of Yuvanáśwa, who by the imprecation of her husband became the
Káverí river: another indication of the Dakshina origin of these works.
The <span id="page_399">p. 399</span> Hari V. has another Jahnu, to whom
it gives the same spouse, as we shall hereafter see.

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[399:6](vp099.htm#fr_1051) Sunuta: Bráhma.
Puru: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1052"></span>[399:7](vp099.htm#fr_1052) Valaka: Bráhma.
Ajaka: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1053"></span>[399:8](vp099.htm#fr_1053) The Bráhma P. and
Hari V. add that Kúśa was in alliance with the Pahlavas and foresters.

<span id="fn_1054"></span>[399:9](vp099.htm#fr_1054) Our authorities
differ as to these names:

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Rámáyańa has
Kuśámba, Kuśanábha, Amurttarayasa, and Vasu; and makes them severally
the founders of Kauśámbi, of Mahodaya (which afterwards appears the same
as Kanoj), Dharmárańya, and Girivraja; the latter being in the
mountainous part of Magadhá. I. s. 29.

<span id="fn_1055"></span>[399:10](vp099.htm#fr_1055) The Bráhma and
Hari V. make Gádhi the son of Kuśika; the Váyu and Bhágavata, of
Kuśánaba; the Rámáyańa, of Kuśanábha.

<span id="fn_1056"></span>[399:11](vp099.htm#fr_1056) The Rámáyańa
notices the marriage, but has no legend. The Mahábhárata, Vans P., has a
rather more detailed narration, but much the same as in the text.
According to the commentator, Aśwatírtha is in the district of Kanoj;
perhaps at the confluence of the Kálanadí with the Ganges. The agency of
the god of Ocean in procuring horses, is a rather curious additional
coincidence between Varuńa and Neptune.

<span id="fn_1057"></span>[399:12](vp099.htm#fr_1057) In the
Mahábhárata, Bhrigu, the father of Richíka, prepares the Charu.

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[400:13](vp099.htm#fr_1058) So the Rámáyańa,
after stating that Satyavatí followed her husband in death, adds, that
she became the Kauśikí river; the Cosi, which, rising in Nepal, flows
through Puraniya into the Ganges, opposite nearly to Rájamahal.

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[401:14](vp099.htm#fr_1059) The text omits the
story of Paraśuráma, but as the legend makes a great figure in the
Vaishńava works in general, I have inserted it from the Mahábhárata,
where it is twice related, once in the Vana Parva, and once in the
Rájadharma section of the Śánti Parva. It is told also at length in the
ninth book of the Bhágavata, in the Padma and Agni Puráńas, &c.
