### CHAP. XVI.

Things proper to be offered as food to deceased ancestors: prohibited
things. Circumstances vitiating a Śráddha: how to be avoided. Song of
the Pitris, or progenitors, heard by Ikshwáku.

AURVA continued.--"Ancestors are satisfied for a month with offerings of
rice or other grain, with clarified butter <span
id="fr_897"></span>[1](#fn_897.md), with fish, or the flesh of the hare, of
birds, of the hog, the goat, the antelope, the deer, the gayal, or the
sheep, or with the milk of the cow, and its products <span
id="fr_898"></span>[2](#fn_898.md). They are for ever satisfied with flesh
(in general), and with that of the long-eared white goat in particular.
The flesh of the rhinoceros, the Kálaśáka potherb, and honey, are also
especial sources of satisfaction to those worshipped at ancestral
ceremonies. The birth of that man is the occasion of satisfaction to his
progenitors who performs at the due time their obsequial rites at Gaya.
Grains that spring up spontaneously, rice growing wild, Panic of both
species (white or black), vegetables that grow in forests, are fit for
ancestral oblations; as are barley, wheat, rice, sesamum, various kinds
of pulse, and mustard. On the other hand, a householder must not offer
any kind of grain that is not consecrated by religious ceremonies on its
first coming into season; nor the pulse called Rájamásha, nor millet,
nor lentils, nor gourds, nor garlick, nor onions, nor nightshade, nor
camels' thorn, nor salt, nor the efflorescence of salt deserts, nor red
vegetable extracts, nor any thing that looks like salt, nor any thing
that is not commendable; nor is water fit to be offered at a Śráddha
that has been brought by night, or has been abandoned, or

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

is so little as not to satisfy a cow, or smells badly, or is covered
with froth. The milk of animals with undivided hoofs, of a camel, a ewe,
a deer, or a buffalo, is unfit for ancestral oblations. If an obsequial
rite is looked at by a eunuch, a man ejected from society, an outcast, a
heretic, a drunken man, or one diseased, by a cock, a naked
ascetic <span id="fr_899"></span>[3](#fn_899.md), a monkey, a village hag,
by a woman in her courses or pregnant, by an unclean person, or by a
carrier of corpses, neither gods nor progenitors will partake of the
food. The ceremony should therefore be performed in a spot carefully
enclosed. Let the performer cast sesamum on the ground, and drive away
malignant spirits. Let him not give food that is fetid, or vitiated by
hairs or insects, or mixed with acid gruel, or stale. Whatever suitable
food is presented with pure faith, and with the enunciation of name and
race, to ancestors, at an obsequial oblation, becomes food to them (or
gives them nourishment). In former times, O king of the earth! this song
of the Pitris was heard by Ikshwáku, the son of Manu, in the groves of
Kalápa (on the skirts of the Himálaya mountains): 'Those of our
descendants shall follow a righteous path who shall reverently present
us with cakes at Gaya. May he be born in our race who shall give us, on
the thirteenth of Bhádrapada and Mágha, milk, honey, and clarified
butter; or when he marries a maiden, or liberates a black bull <span
id="fr_900"></span>[4](#fn_900.md), or performs any domestic ceremony
agreeable to rule, accompanied by donations to the Brahmans <span
id="fr_901"></span>[5](#fn_901.md)!"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_897"></span>[332:1](vp090.htm#fr_897.md) See Manu, III. 266,
&c. The articles are much the same; the periods of satisfaction somewhat
vary.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[332:2](vp090.htm#fr_898.md) The expression Gavya
implies all that is derived from a cow, but in the text it is associated
with 'flesh;' and, as the commentator observes, some consider the flesh
of the cow to be here intended: but this, he adds, relates to other
ages. In the Kali or present age it implies milk and preparations of
milk, The sacrifice of a cow or calf formed part of the ancient Śráddha.
It then became typical, or a bull was turned loose, instead of being
slaughtered; and this is still practised on some
[occasions](errata.htm#15.md). In Manu, the term Gavya is coupled with
others, which limit its application: 'A whole year with the milk of
cows, and food made of that milk.' III. 272.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[333:3](vp090.htm#fr_899.md) Nagna is literally
'naked,' but, as explained in the following chapter, means a Jain
mendicant. No such person is included by Manu (III. 239, &c.) amongst
those who defile a Śráddha by looking upon it. The Váyu contains the
same prohibition.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[333:4](vp090.htm#fr_900.md) Níla vrisha; but this
animal is not altogether or always black. In the Bráhma P., as quoted in
the Nirńaya Sindhu, it is said to be of a red colour, with light face
and tail, and white hoofs and horns; or a white bull, with black face,
&c.; or a black bull, with white face, tail, and feet.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[333:5](vp090.htm#fr_901.md) Very full
descriptions of the Śráddha occur in almost all the Puráńas, especially
in the Váyu, Kúrma, Márkańd́eya, Vámana, and Garud́a. The Matsya and Padma
(Śrisht́hi Khańd́a) contain descriptions which are much the same as that
of the Váyu. The accounts of the Bráhma, Agni, and Varáha are less full
and regular than in some of the others; and in none of them is the
subject so fully and perspicuously treated as in our text. For
satisfactory information, however, the Śráddha Mayúkha and the Nirńaya
Sindhu should be consulted.
