The Fifth Book

The fifth book of the Vishńu Puráńa is exclusively occupied with the
life of Krishńa. This is one of the distinguishing characteristics of
the Puráńa, and is one argument against its antiquity. It is possible,
though not yet proved, that Krishńa as an Avatára of Vishńu, is
mentioned in an indisputably genuine text of the Vedas. He is
conspicuously prominent in the Mahábhárata, but very contradictorily
described there. The part that he usually performs is that of a mere
mortal, although the passages

<span id="page_lxxi">p. lxxi</span>

are numerous that attach divinity to his person. There are, however, no
descriptions in the Mahábhárata of his juvenile frolics, of his sports
in Vrindávan, his pastimes with the cow-boys, or even his destruction of
the Asuras sent to kill him. These stories have all a modern complexion:
they do not harmonize with the tone of the ancient legends, which is
generally grave, and sometimes majestic: they are the creations of a
puerile taste, and grovelling imagination. These Chapters of the Vishńu
Puráńa offer some difficulties as to their originality: they are the
same as those on the same subject in the Brahmá Puráńa: they are not
very dissimilar to those of the Bhágavata. The latter has some incidents
which the Vishńu has not, and may therefore be thought to have improved
upon the prior narrative of the latter. On the other hand, abridgment is
equally a proof of posteriority as amplification. The simpler style of
the Vishńu Puráńa is however in favour of its priority; and the
miscellaneous composition of the Brahmá Puráńa renders it likely to have
borrowed these chapters from the Vishńu. The life of Krishńa in the
Hari-vanśa and the Brahma-vaivartta are indisputably of later date.
