Date of the Vishńu Puráńa

The Vishńu Puráńa has kept very clear of particulars from which an
approximation to its date may be conjectured. No place is described of
which the sacredness has any known limit, nor any work cited of probable

<span id="page_lxxii">p. lxxii</span>

recent composition. The Vedas, the Puráńas, other works forming the body
of Sanscrit literature, are named; and so is the Mahábhárata, to which
therefore it is subsequent. Both Bauddhas and Jains are adverted to. It
was therefore written before the former had disappeared; but they
existed in some parts of India as late as the twelfth century at least;
and it is probable that the Puráńa was compiled before that period. The
Gupta kings reigned in the seventh century; the historical record of the
Puráńa which mentions them was therefore later: and there seems little
doubt that the same alludes to the first incursions of the Mohammedans,
which took place in the eighth century; which brings it still lower. In
describing the latter dynasties, some, if not all, of which were no
doubt contemporary, they are described as reigning altogether one
thousand seven hundred and ninety-six years. Why this duration should
have been chosen does not appear, unless, in conjunction with the number
of years which are said to have elapsed between the great war and the
last of the Andhra dynasty, which preceded these different races, and
which amounted to two thousand three hundred and fifty, the compiler was
influenced by the actual date at which he wrote. The aggregate of the
two periods would be the Kálí year 4146, equivalent to A. D. 1045. There
are some variety and indistinctness in the enumeration of the periods
which compose this total, but the date which results from it is not
unlikely to be an approximation to that of the Vishńu Puráńa.

It is the boast of inductive philosophy, that it draws its conclusions
from the careful observation and accumulation of facts; and it is
equally the business of all philosophical research to determine its
facts before it ventures upon speculation. This procedure has not been
observed in the investigation of the mythology and traditions of the
Hindus. Impatience to generalize has availed itself greedily of whatever
promised to afford materials for generalization; and the most erroneous
views have been confidently advocated, because the guides to which their
authors trusted were ignorant or insufficient. The information gleaned
by Sir Wm. Jones was gathered in an early season of Sanscrit study,
before the field was cultivated. The same may be said of the writings of

<span id="page_lxxiii">p. lxxiii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Paulinus a St.
Barolomæo <span id="fr_94"></span>[96](#fn_94.md), with the further
disadvantage of his having been imperfectly acquainted with the Sanscrit
language and literature, and his veiling his deficiencies under
loftiness of pretension and a prodigal display of misapplied erudition.
The documents to which Wilford <span id="fr_95"></span>[97](#fn_95.md)
trusted proved to be in great part fabrications, and where genuine, were
mixed up with so much loose and unauthenticated matter, and so
overwhelmed with extravagance of speculation, that his citations need to
be carefully and skilfully sifted, before they can be serviceably
employed. The descriptions of Ward <span id="fr_96"></span>[98](#fn_96.md)
are too deeply tinctured by his prejudices to be implicitly confided in;
and they are also derived in a great measure from the oral or written
communications of Bengali pandits, who are not in general very deeply
read in the authorities of their mythology. The accounts of Polier <span
id="fr_97"></span>[99](#fn_97.md) were in like manner collected from
questionable sources, and his Mythologie des Hindous presents a
heterogeneous mixture of popular and Pauráńik tales, of ancient
traditions, and legends apparently invented for the occasion, which
renders the publication worse than useless, except in the hands of those
who can distinguish the pure metal from the alloy. Such are the
authorities to which Maurice, Faber, and Creuzer have exclusively
trusted in their description of the Hindu mythology, and it is no marvel
that there should have been an utter confounding of good and bad in
their selection of materials, and an inextricable mixture of truth and
error in their conclusions. Their labours accordingly are far from
entitled to that confidence which their learning and industry would else
have secured; and a sound and comprehensive survey of the Hindu system
is still wanting to the comparative analysis of the religious opinions
of the ancient world, and to a satisfactory elucidation of an important
chapter in the history of the human race. It is with the hope of
supplying some of the necessary means for the accomplishment of these
objects, that the following pages have been translated.
