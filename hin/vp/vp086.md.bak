### CHAP. XII.

Miscellaneous obligations--purificatory, ceremonial, and moral.

AURVA continued.--"Let a respectable householder ever venerate the gods,
kine, Brahmans, saints, aged persons, and holy teachers. Let him observe
the two daily Sandhyás, and offer oblations to fire. Let him dress in
untorn garments, use delicate herbs and flowers, wear emeralds and other
precious stones, keep his hair smooth and neat, scent his person with
agreeable perfumes, and always go handsomely attired, decorated with
garlands of white flowers. Let him never appropriate another's property,
nor address him with the least unkindness. Let him always speak amiably
and with truth, and never make public another's faults. Let him not
desire another's prosperity, nor seek his enmity. Let him not mount upon
a crazy vehicle, nor take shelter under the bank of a river (which may
fall upon him). A wise man will not form a friendship nor walk in the
same path with one who is disesteemed, who is a sinner or a drunkard,
who has many enemies, or who is lousy, with a harlot or her gallant,
with a pauper or a liar, with a prodigal, a slanderer, or a knave. Let
not a man bathe against the strength of a rapid stream, nor enter a
house on fire, nor climb to the top of a tree; nor (in company) clean
his teeth or blow his nose, nor gape without covering his mouth, nor
clear his throat, nor cough, nor laugh loudly, nor emit wind with noise,
nor bite his nails, nor cut grass, nor scratch the ground <span
id="fr_858"></span>[1](#fn_858.md), nor put his beard into his mouth, nor
crumble a clod of clay; nor look upon the chief planetary bodies when he
is unclean. Let him not express disgust at a corpse, for the odour of a
dead body is the produce of the moon. Let a decent man ever avoid by
night the place where four roads meet, the village tree, the grove
adjacent to the place where bodies are burnt, and a loose woman. Let him
not pass across the shadow of a venerable person, of an image, of a
deity, of a flag, of a heavenly luminary <span
id="fr_859"></span>[2](#fn_859.md). Let him not travel alone through a
forest, nor sleep by

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

himself in an empty house <span id="fr_860"></span>[3](#fn_860.md). Let him
keep remote from hair, bones, thorns, filth, remnants of offerings,
ashes, chaff, and earth <span id="fr_861"></span>[4](#fn_861.md) wet with
water in which another has bathed. Let him not receive the protection of
the unworthy, nor attach himself to the dishonest. Let him not approach
a beast of prey; and let him not tarry long when he has risen from
sleep. Let him not lie in bed when he is awake, nor encounter fatigue
when it is time to rest. A prudent man will avoid, even at a distance,
animals with tusks and horns; and he will shun exposure to frost, to
wind, and to sunshine. A man must neither bathe, nor sleep, nor rinse
his mouth whilst he is naked <span id="fr_862"></span>[5](#fn_862.md): he
must not wash his mouth, or perform any sacred rite, with his waistband
unfastened: and he must not offer oblations to fire, nor sacrifice to
the gods, nor wash his mouth, nor salute a Brahman, nor utter a prayer,
with only one garment on. Let him never associate with immoral persons:
half an instant is the limit for the intercourse of the righteous with
them. A wise man will never engage in a dispute with either his
superiors or inferiors: controversy and marriage are to be permitted
only between equals. Let not a prudent man enter into contention: let
him avoid uprofitable enmity. A small loss may be endured; but he should
shun the wealth that is acquired by hostility.

"When a man has bathed, he must not wipe his limbs with a towel nor with
his hands, nor shake his hair, nor rinse his mouth before he has risen.
Let him not (when sitting) put one foot over another, nor stretch forth
his foot, in the presence of a superior, but sit with modesty in the
posture called Vírásana (or on his knees). He must never pass round a
temple upon his left hand, nor perform the ceremony of circumambulating
any venerable object in the reverse direction. A decent man will not
spit, nor eject any impurity, in front of the moon, fire, the sun,
water, wind, or any respectable person <span
id="fr_863"></span>[6](#fn_863.md); nor will he void urine standing, nor
upon the highway: he will never step over phlegm, ordure, urine, or
blood; nor is the expectoration of the mucus of the throat allowable at
the time of eating, offering sacrifices or oblations, or repeating
prayers, or in the presence of a respectable person.

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

"Let not a man treat women with disrespect, nor let him put entire faith
in them. Let him not deal impatiently with them, nor set them over
matters of importance. A man who is attentive to the duties of his
station will not go forth from his house without saluting the chaplets,
flowers, gems, clarified butter, and venerable persons in it. At proper
seasons he will salute respectfully the places where four roads meet,
when engaged in offering oblations with fire. Let him liberally relieve
the virtuous who are poor, and reverence those who are learned in the
Vedas. He who is a worshipper of the gods and sages, who gives cakes and
water to the manes, and who exercises hospitality, obtains the highest
regions after death. He who speaks wisely, moderately, and kindly, goes
to those worlds which are the inexhaustible sources of happiness. He who
is intelligent, modest, devout, and who reverences wisdom, his
superiors, and the aged, goes to heaven.

"On the days called Parvas, on periods of impurity, upon unseasonable
thunder, and the occurrence of eclipses or atmospheric portents, a wise
man must desist from the study of the Vedas <span
id="fr_864"></span>[7](#fn_864.md). The pious man who suppresses anger and
envy, who is benevolent to all, and allays the fears of others, secures,
as the least of his rewards, enjoyment in Swarga. A man should carry an
umbrella, as a defence against sun and rain; he should bear a staff when
he goes by night, or through a wood; and he should walk in shoes, if he
desires to keep his body from harm. As he goes along he should not look
up, nor about him, nor afar off, but keep his eyes upon the ground to
the extent of a couple of yards.

"The householder who expels all sources of imperfection is in a great
degree acquitted of the three ordinary objects of existence, desire,
wealth, and virtue; sinless amongst the sinful; speaking amicably to all
men; his whole soul melting with benevolence; final felicity is in his
grasp. The earth is upheld by the veracity of those who have subdued
their passions, and, following righteous practices, are never
contaminated by desire, covetousness, and wrath. Let therefore a wise
man ever speak the truth when it is agreeable, and when the truth would
inflict

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

pain let him hold his peace. Let him not utter that which, though
acceptable, would be detrimental; for it were better to speak that which
would be salutary, although it should give exceeding offence <span
id="fr_865"></span>[8](#fn_865.md). A considerate man will always
cultivate, in act, thought, and speech, that which is good for living
beings, both in this world and in the next <span
id="fr_866"></span>[9](#fn_866.md)."

ruin."

The legislator is much more copious on this subject than the author of
the Puráńa.

"Let him say what is true, but let him say what is pleasing. Let him
speak no disagreeable truth, nor let him speak agreeable falsehood. This
is a primeval rule."

<span id="fn_866"></span>[313:9](vp086.htm#fr_866.md) That the preceding
chapter agrees in many respects very closely with the contents of the
fourth book of the Institutes of Manu, on economics and private morals,
will be evident from the instances cited of some of the parallel
passages. Several others might have been adduced.
