<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Description of Bh&aacute;rata-varsha: extent: chief mountains: nine divisions: principal rivers and mountains of Bh&aacute;rata proper: principal nations: superiority over other Varshas, especially as the seat of religious acts. (Topographical lists.)</FONT></p>  
<p>THE country that lies north of the ocean, and south of the snowy mountains, is called Bh&aacute;rata, for there dwelt the descendants of Bharata. It is nine thousand leagues in extent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_389"></A><A HREF="#fn_389"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and is the land of works, in consequence of which men go to heaven, or obtain emancipation.</p>  
<p>The seven main chains of mountains in Bh&aacute;rata are Mahendra, Malaya, Sahya, &#346;uktimat, Riksha, Vindhya, and P&aacute;rip&aacute;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_390"></A><A HREF="#fn_390"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>From this region heaven is obtained, or even, in some cases, liberation</p>

<p>from existence; or men pass from hence into the condition of brutes, or fall into hell. Heaven, emancipation, a state in mid-air, or in the subterraneous realms, succeeds to existence here, and the world of acts is not the title of any other portion of the universe.</p>  
<p>The Varsha of Bh&aacute;rata is divided into nine portions, which I will name to you; they are Indra-dw&iacute;pa, Kaserumat, T&aacute;mravarn&#769;a, Gabhastimat, N&aacute;ga-dw&iacute;pa, Saumya, Gandharba, and V&aacute;run&#769;a; the last or ninth Dw&iacute;pa is surrounded by the ocean, and is a thousand Yojanas from north to south&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>On the east of Bh&aacute;rata dwell the Kir&aacute;tas (the barbarians); on the west, the Yavanas; in the centre reside Brahmans, Kshetriyas, Vai&#347;yas, and &#346;&uacute;dras, occupied in their respective duties of sacrifice, arms, trade, and service&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

Of such as these, and of minor rivers, there is an infinite number; and many nations inhabit the countries on their borders&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The principal nations of Bh&aacute;rata are the Kurus and P&aacute;nch&aacute;las, in the middle districts: the people of K&aacute;marupa, in the east: the Pun&#769;d&#769;ras,</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Kalingas, Magadhas, and southern nations, are in the south: in the extreme west are the Saur&aacute;sht&#769;ras, &#346;&uacute;ras, Bh&iacute;ras, Arbudas: the K&aacute;rushas and M&aacute;lavas, dwelling along the P&aacute;rip&aacute;tra mountains: the Sauv&iacute;ras, the Saindhavas, the H&uacute;nas, the S&aacute;lwas, the people of &#346;&aacute;kala, the Madras, the R&aacute;mas, the Ambasht&#769;has, and the P&aacute;ras&iacute;kas, and others. These nations drink of the water of the rivers above enumerated, and inhabit their borders, happy and prosperous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>In the Bh&aacute;rata-varsha it is that the succession of four Yugas, or ages, the Krita, the Treta, the Dw&aacute;para, and Kali, takes place; that pious ascetics engage in rigorous penance; that devout men offer sacrifices; and that gifts are distributed; all for the sake of another world. In Jambu-dw&iacute;pa, Vishn&#769;u, consisting of sacrifice, is worshipped, as the male of sacrificial rites, with sacrificial ceremonies: he is adored under other forms elsewhere. Bh&aacute;rata is therefore the best of the divisions of Jambu-dw&iacute;pa, because it is the land of works: the others are places of enjoyment alone. It is only after many thousand births, and the aggregation of much merit, that living beings are sometimes born in Bh&aacute;rata as men. The gods themselves exclaim, "Happy are those who are born, even from the condition of gods, as men in Bh&aacute;rata-varsha, as that is the way to the pleasures of Paradise, or the greater blessing of final liberation. Happy are they who, consigning all the unheeded rewards of their acts to the supreme and eternal Vishn&#769;u, obtain existence in that land of works, as their path to him. We know not, when the acts that have obtained us heaven shall have been fully recompensed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, where we shall renew corporeal confinement; but we know that those men are fortunate who are born with perfect faculties&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> in Bh&aacute;rata-varsha."</p>  
<p>I have thus briefly described to you, Maitreya, the nine divisions of Jambu-dw&iacute;pa, which is a hundred thousand Yojanas in extent, and which is encircled, as if by a bracelet, by the ocean of salt water, of similar dimensions.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_389"></A><A HREF="vp060.htm#fr_389">174:1</A> As Bh&aacute;rata-varsha means India, a nearer approach to the truth, with regard to its extent, might have been expected; and the V&aacute;yu has another measurement, which is not much above twice the actual extent, or 1000 Yojanas from Kum&aacute;ri (Comorin) to the source of the Ganges.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_390"></A><A HREF="vp060.htm#fr_390">174:2</A> These are called the Kula parvatas, family mountains, or mountain ranges or systems. They are similarly enumerated in all the authorities, and their situation may be determined with some confidence by the rivers which flow from them. Mahendra is the chain of hills that extends from Orissa and the northern Circars to Gondwana, part of which, near Ganjam, is still called Mahindra Malei, or hills of Mahindra: Malaya is the southern portion of the western Ghats: &#346;uktimat is doubtful, for none of its streams can be identified with any certainty: Sahya is the northern portion of the western Ghauts, the mountains of the Konkan: Riksha is the mountains of Gondwana: Vindhya is the general name of the chain that stretches across central India, but it is here restricted to the eastern division; according to the V&aacute;yu it is the part south of the Narmada, or the Sathpura range: P&aacute;rip&aacute;tra, as frequently written P&aacute;riy&aacute;tra, is the northern and western portion of the Vindhya: the name, indeed, is still given to a range of mountains in Guzerat (see Col. Tod's map of Rajasth&aacute;n), but the Chambal and other rivers of M&aacute;lwa, which are said to flow from the P&aacute;riy&aacute;tra mountains, do not rise in that province. All these mountains therefore belong to one system, and are connected together. The classification seems to have been known to Ptolemy, as he specifies seven ranges of mountains, although his names do not correspond, with exception of the Vindus mons: of the others, the Adisathrus and Uxentus agree nearly in position with the P&aacute;riy&aacute;tra and Riksha: the Apocopi, Sardonix, Bettigo, and Orudii must be left for consideration. The Bh&aacute;gavata, V&aacute;yu, Padma, and M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya add a list of inferior mountains to these seven.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_391"></A><A HREF="vp060.htm#fr_391">175:3</A> This last is similarly left without a name in all the works: it is the most southerly, that on the borders of the sea, and no doubt intends India proper. Wilford places Isere a division called Kum&aacute;rik&aacute;. No description is anywhere attempted of the other divisions. To these the V&aacute;yu adds six minor Dw&iacute;pas, which are situated beyond sea, and are islands, Anga-dw&iacute;pa, Yama-d., Matsya-d., Kumuda or Ku&#347;a-d., Var&aacute;ha-d., and Sankha-d.; peopled for the most part by Mlechchhas, but who worship Hindu divinities. The Bh&aacute;gavata and Padma name eight such islands, Swarn&#769;aprastha, Chandra&#347;ukla, Avarttana, R&aacute;man&#769;aka, Mandah&aacute;ra, P&aacute;nchajanya, Sinhal&aacute;, and Lank&aacute;. Col. Wilford has endeavoured to verify the first series of Upadw&iacute;pas, making Var&aacute;ha Europe; Ku&#347;a, Asia Minor, &amp;c.; &#346;ankha, Africa; Malaya, Malacca: Yama is undetermined; and by Anga, he says, they understand China. How all this may be is more than doubtful, for in the three Pur&aacute;n&#769;as in which mention is made of them, very little more is said upon the subject.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_392"></A><A HREF="vp060.htm#fr_392">175:4</A> By Kir&aacute;tas, foresters and mountaineers are intended, the inhabitants to the present day of the mountains east of Hindustan. The Yavanas, on the west, may be either the Greeks of Bactria and the Punjab--to whom there can be little doubt the term was applied by the Hindus--or the Mohammedans, who succeeded them in a later period, and to whom it is now applied. The V&aacute;yu calls them both Mlechchhas, and also notices the admixture of barbarians with Hindus in India proper. The same passage, slightly varied, occurs in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata: it is said especially of the mountainous districts, and may allude therefore to the Gonds and Bhils of central India, as well as to the Mohammedans of the north-west. The specification implies that infidels and outcastes had not yet descended on the plains of Hindustan.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_393"></A><A HREF="vp060.htm#fr_393">176:5</A> This is a very meagre list, compared with those given in other Pur&aacute;n&#769;as. That of the V&aacute;yu is translated by Col. Wilford, As. Res. vol. VIII; and much curious illustration of many of the places by the same writer occurs, As. Res. vol. XIV. The lists of the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, Bh&aacute;gavata, and Padma are given without any arrangement: those of the V&aacute;yu, Matsya, M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya, and K&uacute;rma are classed as in the text. Their lists are too long for insertion in this place. Of the rivers named in the text, most are capable of verification. The &#346;atadru, 'the hundred channelled'--the Zaradrus of Ptolemy, Hesidrus of Pliny--is the Setlej. The Chandrabh&aacute;g&aacute;, Sandabalis, or Acesines, is the Chinab. The Vedasmriti in the V&aacute;yu and K&uacute;rma is classed with the Vetravat&iacute; or Betwa, the Charmanwati or Chambal, and Sipr&aacute; and P&aacute;r&aacute;, rivers of Malwa, and may be the same with the Beos of the maps. The Narmad&aacute; or Narbadda, the Namadus of Ptolemy, is well known; according to the V&aacute;yu it rises, not in the Vindhya, but in the Riksha mountains, taking its origin in fact in Gondwana. The Suras&aacute; is uncertain. The T&aacute;p&iacute; is the T&aacute;pti, rising also in Gondwana: the other two are not identified. The Godaveri preserves its name: in the other two we have the Beemah and the Krishn&#769;a. For Kritam&aacute;l&aacute; the K&uacute;rma reads Ritum&aacute;l&aacute;, but neither is verified. The T&aacute;mraparn&iacute; is in Tinivelly, and rises at the southern extremity of the western Ghats. The Rishikuly&aacute;, that rises in the Mahendra mountain, is the Rasikulia or Ras&iacute;koila, which flows into the sea near Ganjam. The Tris&aacute;m&aacute; is undetermined. The text assigns another Rishikuly&aacute; to the &#346;uktimat mountains, but in all the other authorities the word is Rish&iacute;ka. The Kum&aacute;r&iacute; might suggest some connexion with Cape Comorin, but that the Malaya mountains seem to extend to the extreme south. A Rishikuly&aacute; river is mentioned (Vana P. v. 3026) as a T&iacute;rtha in the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, in connexion apparently with the hermitage of Va&#347;isht&#769;ha, which in another passage (v. 4096) is said to be on mount Arbuda or Abu. In that case, and if the reading of the text be admitted for the name of the river, the &#346;uktimat range would be the mountains of Guzerat; but this is doubtful.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_394"></A><A HREF="vp060.htm#fr_394">177:6</A> The list of nations is as scanty as that of the rivers: it is, however, omitted altogether in the Bh&aacute;gavata. The Padma has a long catalogue, but without arrangement; so has the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata. The lists of the V&aacute;yu, Matsya, and M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya class the nations as central, northern, eastern, southern, and western. The names are much the same in all, and are given in the 8th vol. of the As. Res. from the Brahm&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a, or, for it is the same account, the V&aacute;yu. The M&aacute;rkan&#769;d&#769;eya has a second classification, and, comparing Bh&aacute;rata-varsha to a tortoise, with its head to the east, enumerates the countries in the head, tail, flanks, and feet of the animal. It will be sufficient here to attempt an identification of the names in the text, but some further illustration is offered at the end of the chapter. The Kurus are the people of Kurukshetra, or the upper part of the Doab, about Delhi. The P&aacute;nch&aacute;las, it appears from the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata, occupied the lower part of the Doab, extending across the Jumna to the Chambal. Kull&uacute;ka Bhat&#769;t&#769;a, in his commentary on Manu, II. 59, places them at Kanoj. K&aacute;marupa is the north-eastern part of Bengal, and western portion of Asam. Pun&#769;d&#769;ra is Bengal proper, with part of south Behar and the Jungle Mahals. Kalinga is the sea-coast west of the mouths of the Ganges, with the upper part of the Coromandel coast. Magadh&aacute; is Behar. The Saur&aacute;sht&#769;ras are the people of Surat, the Surastrene of Ptolemy. The &#346;&uacute;ras and Bh&iacute;ras, in the same direction, may be the Suri and Phauni or Phryni of Strabo. The Arbudas must be the people about mount Abu, or the natives of Mewar. The K&aacute;rushas and M&aacute;lavas are of course the people of Malwa. The Sauv&iacute;ras and Saindhavas are usually conjoined as the Sindhu-Sauv&iacute;ras, and must be the nations of Sindh and western Rajput&aacute;na. By the Minas we are to understand the white Huns or Indo-Scythians, who were established in the Punjab and along the Indus at the commencement of our era, as we know from Arrian, Strabo, and Ptolemy, confirmed by recent discoveries of their coins, The &#346;&aacute;lwas or, as also read, &#346;&aacute;lyas are placed by the V&aacute;yu and Matsya amongst the central nations, and seem to have occupied part of R&aacute;jasthan, a &#346;&aacute;lwa R&aacute;ja being elsewhere described as engaging in hostilities with the people of Dwarak&aacute; in Guzerat. &#346;&aacute;kala, as I have elsewhere noticed, is a city in the Punjab (As. Res. XV. 108), the Sagala of Ptolemy (ibid. 107); the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata makes it the capital of the Madras, the Mardi of the ancients; but they are separately named in the text, and were situated something more to the south-east. <a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="green">p. 178</font></A> The R&aacute;mas and Ambasht&#769;has are not named in the other Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, but the latter are amongst the western, or more properly north-western nations subjugated by Nakula, in his Dig-vijaya. Mah&aacute;bh. Sabh&aacute; P. Ambas and Ambasht&#769;has are included in the list extracted by Col. Wilford from the Var&aacute;ha Sanhit&aacute;, and the latter are supposed by him to be the Ambast&aelig; of Arrian. The P&aacute;ras&iacute;kas carry us into Persia, or that part of it adjoining to the Indus. As far as the enumeration of the text extends, it seems applicable to the political and geographical divisions of India about the era of Christianity.</P>
