### CHAP. VI.

Kings of the lunar dynasty. Origin of Soma, or the moon: he carries off
Tárá, the wife of Vrihaspati: war between the gods and Asuras in
consequence: appeased by Brahmá. Birth of Budha: married to Ilá,
daughter of Vaivaswata. Legend of his son Pururavas, and the nymph
Urvaśí: the former institutes offerings with fire: ascends to the sphere
of the Gandharbas.

MAITREYA.--You have given me, reverend preceptor, an account of the
kings of the dynasty of the sun: I am now desirous to hear a description
of the princes who trace their lineage from the moon, and whose race is
still celebrated for glorious deeds. Thou art able to relate it to me,
Brahman, if thou wilt so favour me.

PARÁŚARA.--You shall hear from me, Maitreya, an account of the
illustrious family of the moon, which has produced many celebrated
rulers of the earth; a race adorned by the regal qualities of strength,
valour, magnificence, prudence, and activity; and enumerating amongst
its monarchs Nahusha, Yayáti, Kártavíryárjuna, and others equally
renowned. That race will I describe to you: do you attend.

Atri was the son of Brahmá, the creator of the universe, who sprang from
the lotus that grew from the navel of Náráyańa. The son of Atri was
Soma <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1](#fn_1040) (the moon.md), whom Brahmá
installed as the sovereign of plants, of Brahmans, and of the stars.
Soma celebrated the Rájasúya sacrifice, and from the glory thence
acquired, and the extensive dominion with which he had been invested, he
became arrogant and licentious, and carried off Tárá, the wife of
Vrihaspati, the preceptor of the gods. In vain Vrihaspati sought to
recover his bride; in vain Brahmá commanded, and the holy sages
remonstrated; Soma refused to relinquish her. Uśanas, out of enmity to
Vrihaspati, took part with Soma. Rudra, who had studied under Angiras,
the father of Vrihaspati, befriended his

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

fellow-student. In consequence of Uśanas, their preceptor, joining Soma,
Jambha, Kujambha, and all the Daityas, Dánavas, and other foes of the
gods, came also to his assistance; whilst Indra and all the gods were
the allies of Vrihaspati.

Then there ensued a fierce contest, which, being on account of Táraká
(or Tárá), was termed the Tárakámaya or Táraká war. In this the gods,
led by Rudra, hurled their missiles on the enemy; and the Daityas with
equal determination assailed the gods. Earth, shaken to her centre by
the struggle between such foes, had recourse to Brahmá for protection;
on which he interposed, and commanding Uśanas with the demons and Rudra
with the deities to desist from strife, compelled Soma to restore Tárá
to her husband. Finding that she was pregnant, Vrihaspati desired her no
longer to retain her burden; and in obedience to his orders she was
delivered of a son, whom she deposited in a clump of long Munja grass.
The child, from the moment of its birth, was endued with a splendour
that dimmed the radiance of every other divinity, and both Vrihaspati
and Soma, fascinated by his beauty, claimed him as their child. The
gods, in order to settle the dispute, appealed to Tárá; but she was
ashamed, and would make no answer. As she still continued mute to their
repeated applications, the child became incensed, and was about to curse
her, saying, "Unless, vile woman, you immediately declare who is my
father, I will sentence you to such a fate as shall deter every female
in future from hesitating to speak the truth." On this, Brahmá again
interfered, and pacified the child; and then, addressing Tárá, said,
"Tell me, daughter, is this the child of Vrihaspati, or of Soma?" "Of
Soma," said Tárá, blushing. As soon as she had spoken, the lord of the
constellations, his countenance bright, and expanding with rapture,
embraced his son, and said, "Well done, my boy; verily thou art wise:"
and hence his name was Budha <span id="fr_1041"></span>[2](#fn_1041.md).

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

It has already been related how Budha begot Purúravas by Ilá.
Purúravas <span id="fr_1042"></span>[3](#fn_1042.md) was a prince renowned
for liberality, devotion, magnificence, and love of truth, and for
personal beauty. Urvaśí having incurred the imprecation of Mitra and
Varuńa, determined to take up her abode in the world of mortals; and
descending accordingly, beheld Purúravas. As soon as she saw him she
forgot all reserve, and disregarding the delights of Swarga, became
deeply enamoured of the prince. Beholding her infinitely superior to all
other females in grace, elegance, symmetry, delicacy, and beauty,
Pururavas was equally fascinated by Urvaśí: both were inspired by
similar sentiments, and mutually feeling that each was every thing to
the other, thought no more of any other object. Confiding in his merits,
Purúravas addressed the nymph, and said, "Fair creature, I love you;
have compassion on me, and return my affection." Urvaśí, half averting
her face through modesty, replied, "I will do so, if you will observe
the conditions I have to propose." "What are they?" inquired the prince;
"declare them." "I have two rams," said the nymph, "which I love as
children; they must be kept near my bedside, and never suffered to be
carried away: you must also take care never to he seen by me undressed;
and clarified butter alone must be my food." To these terms the king
readily gave assent.

After this, Purúravas and Urvaśí dwelt together in Alaká, sporting
amidst the groves and lotus-crowned lakes of Chaitraratha, and the other
forests there situated, for sixty-one thousand years <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[4](#fn_1043.md). The love of

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Purúravas for his
bride increased every day of its duration; and the affection of Urvaśí
augmenting equally in fervour, she never called to recollection
residence amongst the immortals. Not so with the attendant spirits at
the court of Indra; and nymphs, genii, and quiristers, found heaven
itself but dull whilst Urvaśí was away. Knowing the agreement that
Urvaśí had made with the king, Viśwavasu was appointed by the Gandharbas
to effect its violation; and he, coming by night to the chamber where
they slept, carried off one of the rams. Urvaśí was awakened by its
cries, and exclaimed, Ah me! who has stolen one of my children? Had I a
husband, this would not have happened! To whom shall I apply for aid?"
The Rájá overheard her lamentation, but recollecting that he was
undressed, and that Urvaśí might see him in that state, did not move
from the couch. Then the Gandharbas came and stole the other ram; and
Urvaśí, hearing it bleat, cried out that a woman had no protector who
was the bride of a prince so dastardly as to submit to this outrage.
This incensed Purúravas highly, and trusting that the nymph would not
see his person, as it was dark, he rose, and took his sword, and pursued
the robbers, calling upon them to stop, and receive their punishment. At
that moment the Gandharbas caused a flash of brilliant lightning to play
upon the chamber, and Urvaśí beheld the king undressed: the compact was
violated, and the nymph immediately disappeared. The Gandharbas,
abandoning the rams, departed to the region of the gods.

Having recovered the animals, the king returned delighted to his couch,
but there he beheld no Urvaśí; and not finding her any where, he
wandered naked over the world, like one insane. At length coming to
Kurukshetra, he saw Urvaśí sporting with four other nymphs of heaven in
a lake beautified with lotuses, and he ran to her, and called her his
wife, and wildly implored her to return. "Mighty monarch," said the
nymph, "refrain from this extravagance. I am now pregnant: depart at
present, and come hither again at the end of a year, when I will deliver
to you a son, and remain with you for one night." Purúravas, thus
comforted, returned to his capital. Urvaśí said to her companions, "This
prince is a most excellent mortal: I lived with him

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

long and affectionately united." "It was well done of you," they
replied; "he is indeed of comely appearance, and one with whom we could
live happily for ever."

When the year had expired, Urvaśí and the monarch met at Kurukshetra,
and she consigned to him his first-born Áyus; and these annual
interviews were repeated, until she had borne to him five sons. She then
said to Purúravas, "Through regard for me, all the Gandharbas have
expressed their joint purpose to bestow upon my lord their benediction:
let him therefore demand a boon." The Rájá replied, "My enemies are all
destroyed, my faculties are all entire; I have friends and kindred,
armies and treasures: there is nothing which I may not obtain except
living in the same region with my Urvaśí. My only desire therefore is,
to pass my life with her." When he had thus spoken, the Gandharbas
brought to Purúravas a vessel with fire, and said to him, "Take this
fire, and, according to the precepts of the Vedas, divide it into three
fires; then fixing your mind upon the idea of living with Urvaśí, offer
oblations, and you shall assuredly obtain your wishes." The Rájá took
the brasier, and departed, and came to a forest. Then he began to
reflect that he had committed a great folly in bringing away the vessel
of fire instead of his bride; and leaving the vessel in the wood, he
went disconsolate to his palace. In the middle of the night he awoke,
and considered that the Gandharbas had given him the brasier to enable
him to obtain the felicity of living with Urvaśí, and that it was absurd
in him to have left it by the way. Resolving therefore to recover it, he
rose, and went to the place where he had deposited the vessel; but it
was gone. In its stead he saw a young Aśwattha tree growing out of a
Śami plant, and he reasoned with himself, and said, "I left in this spot
a vessel of fire, and now behold a young Aśwattha tree growing out of a
Śami plant. Verily I will take these types of fire to my capital, and
there, having engendered fire by their attrition, I will worship it."
Having thus determined, he took the plants to his city, and prepared
their wood for attrition, with pieces of as many inches long as there
are syllables in the Gayatrí: he recited that holy verse, and rubbed
together sticks of as many inches as he recited syllables in the

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gayatrí <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[5](#fn_1044.md). Having thence elicited fire, he made
it threefold, according to the injunctions of the Vedas, and offered
oblations with it, proposing as the end of the ceremony reunion with
Urvaśí. In this way, celebrating many sacrifices agreeably to the form
in which offerings are presented with fire, Purúravas obtained a seat in
the sphere of the Gandharbas, and was no more separated from his
beloved. Thus fire, that was at first but one, was made threefold in the
present Manwantara by the son of Ilá <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[6](#fn_1045.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1040"></span>[392:1](vp098.htm#fr_1040.md) The Váyu says the
essence of Soma (Somatwa) issued from the eyes of Atri, and impregnated
the ten quarters. The Bhágavata says merely that Soma was born from the
eyes of Atri. The Bráhma P. and Hari V. give a grosser name to the
effusion.

<span id="fn_1041"></span>[393:2](vp098.htm#fr_1041.md) 'He who knows.'
Much erroneous speculation has originated in confounding this Budha, the
son of Soma, and regent of the planet Mercury, 'he who knows,' the
intelligent, with Buddha, any deified mortal, or 'he by whom truth is
known;' or, as individually applicable, Gautama or Śákya, son of the
Raja Śuddhodana, by <span id="page_394">p. 394</span> whom the Buddhists
themselves aver their doctrines were first promulgated. The two
characters have nothing in common, and the names are identical only when
one or other is misspelt.

<span id="fn_1042"></span>[394:3](vp098.htm#fr_1042.md) The story of
Purúravas is told much in the same strain as follows, though with some
variations, and in greater or less detail, in the Váyu, Matsya, Vámana,
Padma, and Bhágavata Puráńas. It is also referred to in the Mahábhárata,
vol. I. p. 113. It is likewise the subject of the Vikrama and Urvaśí of
Kálídása, in which drama the incidents offensive to good taste are not
noticed. See Hindu Theatre, vol. I. p. 587. The Matsya Puráńa, besides
this story, which is translated in the introduction to the drama, has in
another part, c. 94, an account of a Purúravas, who, in the Chákshusha
Manwantara, was king of Mad́ra, and who by the worship of Vishńu obtained
a residence with the Gandharbas.

<span id="fn_1043"></span>[394:4](vp098.htm#fr_1043.md) One copy has
sixty-one years; the Bráhma P. and Hari V. have fifty-nine: one period
is as likely as the other.

<span id="fn_1044"></span>[397:5](vp098.htm#fr_1044.md) It does not appear
why this passage is repeated. The length of the sticks, conformably to
the number of syllables in the usual form of the Gayatrí, would be
twenty-four inches. The Bhágavata attaches to the operation a piece of
mysticism of a Tántrika origin: Purúravas, whilst performing the
attrition, mentally identifies himself and Urvaśí with the two sticks,
and repeats the Mantra, \#\#\#.

<span id="fn_1045"></span>[397:6](vp098.htm#fr_1045.md) The division of one
fire into three is ascribed to Purúravas by the Mahábhárata and the
rest. The commentator on the former specifies them as the Gárhapatya,
Dakshińa, and Áhavaníya, which Sir Wm. Jones, Manu, II. 231, renders
nuptial, ceremonial, and sacrificial fires; or rather, 1. household,
that which is perpetually maintained by a householder; 2. a fire for
sacrifices, placed to the south of the rest; and 3. a consecrated fire
for oblations; forming the Tretágni, or triad of sacred fires, in
opposition to the Laukika, or merely temporal ones. To Purúravas it
would appear the triple arrangement was owing; but there are some other
curious traditions regarding him, which indicate his being the author of
some important innovations in the Hindu ritual. The Bhágavata says, that
before his time there was but one Veda, one caste, one fire, and one
god, Náráyańa; and that, in the beginning of the Treta age, Purúravas
made them all 'three:' that is, according to the commentator, the ritual
was then instituted: The Matsya P. has an account of this prince's going
to the orbit of the sun and moon at every conjunction, when oblations to
progenitors are to be offered, as if obsequial rites had originated with
Purúravas. The Mahábhárata states some still more remarkable
particulars. 'The glorious Purúravas, endowed, although a mortal, with
the properties of a deity, governing the thirteen islands of the ocean,
engaged in hostilities with the Brahmans in the pride of his strength,
and seized their jewels, as they exclaimed against his oppression.
Sanatkumára came from the sphere of Brahmá to teach him the rules of
duty, but Purúravas did not accept his instructions, and the king,
deprived of understanding by the pride of his power, and actuated by
avarice, was therefore ever accursed by the offended great sages, and
was destroyed.'
