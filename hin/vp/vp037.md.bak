### CHAP. III.

Measure of time. Moments or Kásht́hás, &c.; day and night; fortnight,
month, year, divine year: Yugas, or ages: Maháyuga, or great age: day of
Brahmá: periods of the Manus: a Manwantara: night of Brahmá, and
destruction of the world: a year of Brahmá: his life: a Kalpa: a
Parárrdha: the past, or Pádma Kalpa: the present, or Váráha.

MAITREYA.--How can creative agency be attributed to that Brahma, who is
without qualities, illimitable, pure, and free from imperfection?

PARÁŚARA.--The essential properties of existent things are objects of
observation, of which no foreknowledge is attainable; and creation, and
hundreds of properties, belong to Brahma, as inseparable parts of his
essence, as heat, oh chief of sages, is inherent in fire <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md). Hear then how

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

the deity Náráyána, in the person of Brahmá, the great parent of the
world, created all existent things.

Brahmá is said to be born: a familiar phrase, to signify his
manifestation; and, as the peculiar measure of his presence, a hundred
of his years is said to constitute his life: that period is also called
Param, and the half of it, Parárddham <span
id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_151.md). I have already declared to you, oh
sinless Brahman, that Time is a form of Vishńu: hear now how it is
applied to measure the duration of Brahmá, and of all other sentient
beings, as well as of those which are unconscious, as the mountains,
oceans, and the like.

Oh best of sages, fifteen twinklings of the eye make a Kásht́há; thirty
Kásht́hás, one Kalá; and thirty Kalás, one Muhúrtta <span
id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_152.md). Thirty Muhúrttas

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

constitute a day and night of mortals: thirty such days make a month,
divided into two half-months: six months form an Ayana (the period of
the sun's progress north or south of the ecliptic): and two Ayanas
compose a year. The southern Ayana is a night, and the northern a day of
the gods. Twelve thousand divine years, each composed of (three hundred
and sixty) such days, constitute the period of the four Yugas, or ages.
They are thus distributed: the Krita age has four thousand divine years;
the Tretá three thousand; the Dwápara two thousand; and the Kali age one
thousand: so those acquainted with antiquity have declared. The period
that precedes a Yuga is called a Sandhyá, and it is of as many hundred
years as there are thousands in the Yuga: and the period that follows a
Yuga, termed the Sandhyánsa, is of similar duration. The interval
between the Sandhyá and the Sandhyánsa is the Yuga, denominated Krita,
Tretá, &c. The Krita, Tretá, Dwápara, and Kali, constitute a great age,
or aggregate of four ages: a thousand such aggregates are a day of
Brahmá, and fourteen Menus reign within that term. Hear the division of
time which they measure <span id="fr_153"></span>[4](#fn_153.md).

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

Seven Rishis, certain (secondary) divinities, Indra, Manu, and the kings
his sons, are created and perish at one period <span
id="fr_154"></span>[5](#fn_154.md); and the interval, called a Manwantara,
is equal to seventy-one times the number of years contained in the four
Yugas, with some additional years: this is the duration of the Manu, the
(attendant) divinities, and the rest, which is equal to 852.000 divine
years, or to 306.720.000 years of mortals, independent of the additional
period <span id="fr_155"></span>[6](#fn_155.md). Fourteen times this period
constitutes

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

a Bráhma day, that is, a day of Brahmá; the term (Bráhma) being the
derivative form. At the end of this day a dissolution of the universe
occurs, when all the three worlds, earth, and the regions of space, are
consumed with fire. The dwellers of Maharloka (the region inhabited by
the saints who survive the world), distressed by the heat, repair then
to Janaloka (the region of holy men after their decease). When the-three
worlds are but one mighty ocean, Brahmá, who is one with Náráyańa,
satiate with the demolition of the universe, sleeps upon his
serpent-bed--contemplated, the lotus born, by the ascetic inhabitants of
the Janaloka--for a night of equal duration with his day; at the close
of which he creates anew. Of such days and nights is a year of Brahmá
composed; and a hundred such years constitute his whole life <span
id="fr_156"></span>[7](#fn_156.md). One Parárddha <span
id="fr_157"></span>[8](#fn_157.md), or half his existence, has expired,
terminating with the Mahá Kalpa <span id="fr_158"></span>[9](#fn_158.md)
called Pádma. The Kalpa (or day of Brahmá) termed Váráha is the first of
the second period of Brahmá's existence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_150"></span>[21:1](vp037.htm#fr_150.md) Agency depends upon
the Rája guna, the quality of foulness or passion, which is an
imperfection. Perfect being is void of all qualities, and is therefore
inert:

Omnis enim per se divom natura necesse est  
Immortali ævo summa cum pace fruatur:

but if inert for ever, creation could not occur. The objection is rather
evaded than answered. The ascribing to Brahma of innumerable and
unappreciable properties is supported by the commentator with vague and
scarcely applicable texts of the Vedas. 'In him there is neither
instrument nor effect: his like, his superior, is nowhere seen.' 'That
supreme soul is the subjugator of all, the ruler of all, the sovereign
of all.' In various places of the Vedas also it is said that his power
is supreme, and that wisdom, power, and action are his essential
properties. The origin of creation is also imputed in the Vedas to the
rise of will or desire in the Supreme: 'He wished I may become manifold,
I may create creatures.' The Bhágavata expresses the same doctrine: 'The
Supreme Being was before all things alone, the soul and lord of
spiritual substance: in consequence of his own will he is secondarily
defined, as if of various minds.' This will however, in the mysticism of
the Bhágavata, is personified as Máyá: 'She (that desire) was the energy
of the Supreme, who was contemplating (the untreated world); and by her,
whose name is Máyá, the Lord made the universe.' This, which was at
first a mere poetical personification of the divine will, came, in such
works as the Bhágavata, to denote a female divinity, coequal and
coeternal with the First Cause. It may be doubted if the Vedas authorize
such a mystification, and no very decided vestige of it occurs in the
Vishńu Puráńa.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[22:2](vp037.htm#fr_151.md) This term is also
applied to a different and still more protracted period. See b. VI. C.
3.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[22:3](vp037.htm#fr_152.md) The last proportion is
rather obscurely expressed: 'Thirty of them (Kalás) are the rule for the
Muhúrtta.' The commentator says it means that thirty Kalás make a
Ghatiká (or Ghari), and two Ghatikás a Muhúrtta; but his explanation is
gratuitous, and is at variance with more explicit passages elsewhere; as
in the Matsya: 'A Muhúrtta is thirty Kalás.' In these divisions of the
twenty-four hours the Kúrma, Márkańd́eya, Matsya, Váyu, and Linga Puráńas
exactly agree with our authority. In Manu, I. 64, we have the same
computation, with a difference in the first article, eighteen Nimeshas
being one Kasht́há. The Bhavishya P. follows Manu in that respect, and
agrees in the rest with the Padma, which has,

<div align="center">

| 15 Nimeshas  | = 1 Kásht́há        |

| 12 Kshańas   | =1 Muhúrtta        |
| 30 Muhúrttas | = 1 day and night. |

</div>

In the Mahábhárata, Moksha Dherma, it is said that thirty Kalás and
one-tenth, or, according to the commentator, thirty Kalás and three
Kásht́hás, make a Muhúrtta. A still greater variety, however, occurs in
the Bhágavata and in the Brahma Vaivartta P. These have,

</div>

Allusions to this or either of the preceding computations, or to any
other, have not been found in either of the other Puráńas: <span
id="page_23">p. 23</span> yet the work of Gopála Bhat́t́a, from which Mr.
Colebrooke states he derived his information on the subject of Indian
weights and measures (A. R. 5. 105), the Sankhya Parimáńa, cites the
Varáha P. for a peculiar computation, and quotes another from the
Bhavishya, different from that which occurs in the first chapter of that
work, to which we have referred. The principle of the calculation
adopted by the astronomical works is different: it is, 6 respirations
(Práńa) = 1 Vikalá; 60 Vikalás = 1 Dańd́a; 60 Dańd́as =1 sydereal day. The
Nimesha, which is the base of one of the Pauráńic modes, is a twinkle of
the eye of a man at rest; whilst the Paramáńu, which is the origin of
the other, and apparently more modern system, considering the works in
which it occurs, is the time taken by a Paramáńu, or mote in the
sunbeam, to pass through a crevice in a shutter. Some indications of
this calculation being in common currency, occur in the Hindustani terms
Reńu (Trasareńu) and Lamhu (Laghu) in Indian horometry (A. R. 5. 81);
whilst the more ordinary system seems derived from the astronomical
works, being 60 Tilas = 1 Vipala; 60 Vipalas = 1 Pala; 60 Palas = 1
Dańd́a or Ghari. *Ibid*.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[23:4](vp037.htm#fr_153.md) These calculations of
time are found in most of the Puráńas, with some additions occasionally,
of no importance, as that of the year of the seven Rishis, 3030 mortal
years, and the year of Dhruva, 9090 such years, in the Linga P. In all
essential points the computations accord, and the scheme, extravagant as
it may appear, seems to admit of easy explanation. We have, in the first
place, a computation of the years of the gods in the four ages, or,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If these divine
years are converted into years of mortals, by multiplying them by 360, a
year of men being a day of the gods, we obtain the years of which the
Yugas of mortals are respectively said to consist:

<div align="center">

|            |                       |
|------------|-----------------------|
| 4800 x 360 | = 1.728.000           |
| 3600 x 360 | = 1.296.000           |
| 2400 x 360 | = 864.000             |
| 1200 x 360 | = <u>432.000</u>      |
|            | 4.320.000 a Maháyuga. |

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> So that these
periods resolve themselves into very simple elements: the notion of four
ages in a deteriorating series expressed by descending arithmetical
progression, as 4, 3, 2, 5; the conversion of units into thousands; and
the mythological fiction, that these were divine years, each composed of
360 years of men. It does not seem necessary to refer the invention to
any astronomical computations, or to any attempt to represent actual
chronology.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[24:5](vp037.htm#fr_154.md) The details of these,
as occurring in each Manwantara, are given in the third book, c. 1 and
2.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[24:6](vp037.htm#fr_155.md) 'One and seventy
enumerations of the four ages, with a surplus.' A similar reading occurs
in several other Puráńas, but none of them state of what the surplus or
addition consists; but it is, in fact, the number of years required to
reconcile two computations of the Kalpa. The most simple, and probably
the original calculation of a Kalpa, is its being 1000 great ages, or
ages of the gods: \#\#\# Bhavishya P. Then 4.320.000 years, or a divine
age, x 1000 = 4320.000.000 years, or a day or night of Brahmá,. But a
day of Brahmá is also seventy-one times a great age multiplied by
fourteen: 4.320.000 x 71 x 14= 4.294.080.000, or less than the preceding
by 25.920.000; and it is to make up for this deficiency that a certain
number of years must be added to the computation by Manwantaras.
According to the Súrya Siddhánta, as cited by Mr. Davis (A. R. 2. 231),
this addition consists of a Sandhi to each Manwantara, equal to the
Satya age, or 5.728.000 years; and one similar Sandhi at the
commencement of the Kalpa: thus <span id="page_25">p. 25</span>
4.320.000 x 71 = 306.720.000 + 1.728.000 = 308.448.000 x 14 =
4318.272.000 + 1.728.000 = 4320.000.000. The Pauranics, however, omit
the Sandhi of the Kalpa, and add the whole compensation to the
Manwantaras. The amount of this in whole numbers is 1.851.428 in each
Manwantara, or 4.320.000 x 71= 306.720.000 + 1.851.428 = 308.571.428 x
14 = 4319.999.992; leaving a very small inferiority to the result of the
calculation of a Kalpa by a thousand great ages. To provide for this
deficiency, indeed, very minute subdivisions are admitted into the
calculation; and the commentator on our text says, that the additional
years, if of gods, are 5142 years, 10 months, 8 days, 4 watches, 2
Muhúrttas, 8 Kalás, 17 Kásht́hás, 2 Nimeshas, and 1/7th; if of mortals,
1.851.428 years, 6 months, 24 days, 12 Náris, 12 Kalás, 25 Kásht́has, and
10 Nimeshas. It will be observed, that in the Kalpa we have the regular
descending series 4, 3, 2, with cyphers multiplied ad libitum.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[25:7](vp037.htm#fr_156.md) The Brahma Vaivartta
says 108 years, but this is unusual. Brahmá's life is but a Nimesha of
Krishńa, according to that work; a Nimesha of Śiva, according to the
Saiva Puráńa.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[25:8](vp037.htm#fr_157.md) In the last book the
Parárddha occurs as a very different measure of time, but it is employed
here in its ordinary acceptation.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[25:9](vp037.htm#fr_158.md) In theory the Kalpas
are infinite; as the Bhavishya: 'Excellent sages, thousands of millions
of Kalpas have passed, and as many are to come.' In the Linga Puráńa,
and others of the Saiva division, above thirty Kalpas are named, and
some account given of several, but they are evidently sectarial
embellishments. The only Kalpas usually specified are those which follow
in the text: the one which was the last, or the Pádma, and the present
<span id="page_26">p. 26</span> or Váráha. The first is also commonly
called the Bráhma; but the Bhágavata distinguishes the Bráhma,
considering it to be the first of Brahmá's life, whilst the Pádma was
the last of the first Parárddha. The terms Maná, or great Kalpa, applied
to the Padma, is attached to it only in a general sense; or, according
to the commentator, because it comprises, as a minor Kalpa, that in
which Brahmá was born from a lotus. Properly, a great Kalpa is not a
day, but a life of Brahmá; as in the Brahma Vaivartta: 'Chronologers
compute a Kalpa by the life of Brahmá. Minor Kalpas, as Samvartta and
the rest, are numerous.' Minor Kalpas here denote every period of
destruction, or those in which the Samvartta wind, or other destructive
agents, operate. Several other computations of time are found in
different Puráńas, but it will be sufficient to notice one which occurs
in the Hari Vanśa, as it is peculiar, and because it is not quite
correctly given in M. Langlois' translation. It is the calculation of
the Mánava time, or time of a Menu.

<div align="center">

|     |                |                              |
|-----|----------------|------------------------------|
| 10  | divine years   | = a day and night of a Menu. |
| 10  | Mánava days    | = his fortnight.             |
| 10  | Mánava fortn.  | = his month.                 |
| 12  | Mánava months  | = his season.                |
| 6   | Mánava seasons | = his year.                  |

</div>

Accordingly the commentator says 72000 divine years make up his year.
The French translation has, "dix années des dieux font un jour de Menu;
dix jours des dieux font un pakcha de Menu," &c. The error lies in the
expression "jours *des dieux*," and is evidently a mere inadvertence;
for if ten *years* make a *day*, ten *days* can scarcely make a
*fortnight*.
