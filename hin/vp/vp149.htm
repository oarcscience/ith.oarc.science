<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">Children of Krishn&#769;a. Ush&aacute;, the daughter of B&aacute;n&#769;a, sees Aniruddha in a dream, and becomes enamoured of him.</FONT></p>  
<p>PAR&Aacute;&#346;ARA.--I have enumerated to you Pradyumna and the other sons of Rukmin&iacute;. Satyabh&aacute;m&aacute; bore Bh&aacute;nu and Bhairika. The sons of Rohin&#769;&iacute; were D&iacute;ptimat, T&aacute;mrapakshi, and others. The powerful &#346;&aacute;mba and other sons were born of J&aacute;mbavat&iacute;. Bhadravinda and other valiant youths were the sons of N&aacute;gnajit&iacute;. &#346;aivy&aacute; (or Mitravind&aacute;) had several sons, of whom Sangr&aacute;majit was the chief. Vrika and others were begotten by Hari on M&aacute;dr&iacute;. Lakshman&aacute; had G&aacute;travat and others: and &#346;ruta and others were the sons of K&aacute;lind&iacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1551"></A><A HREF="#fn_1551"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Krishn&#769;a had sons also by his other wives, in all one hundred and eighty thousand. The eldest of the whole was Pradyumna, the son of Rukmin&iacute;: his son was Aniruddha, from whom Vraja was born: his mother was Ush&aacute;, the daughter of B&aacute;n&#769;a, and grand-daughter of Bali, whom Aniruddha won in war. On that occasion a fierce battle took place between Hari and &#346;ankara, in which the thousand arms of B&aacute;n&#769;a were lopped away by the discus of the former.</p>  
<p>MAITREYA.--HOW happened it, venerable Brahman, that a contest on account of Ush&aacute; arose between &#346;iva and Krishn&#769;a? and in what manner did Hari cut off the thousand arms of B&aacute;n&#769;a? This, illustrious sir, thou art able to narrate.</p>  
<p>PAR&Aacute;&#346;ARA.--Ush&aacute;, the daughter of B&aacute;n&#769;a, having seen P&aacute;rvat&iacute; sporting with her lord, &#346;ambhu, was inspired with a wish for similar dalliance. The beautiful Gaur&iacute;, who knows the hearts of all, said to Ush&aacute;, "Do not grieve; you shall have a husband." "But when will this be?" thought Ush&aacute; to herself, "or who will be my lord?" On which P&aacute;rvat&iacute; continued; "He who shall appear to you, princess, in a dream on the twelfth lunation of the light half of Vai&#347;&aacute;kha, he will be your husband."</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Accordingly, as the goddess had foretold, on that lunar day a youth appeared to Ush&aacute; in a dream, of whose person she became enamoured. When she woke, and no longer perceived him, she was overcome with sorrow, and, unrestrained by modesty, demanded of her companion whither he had gone. The companion and friend of the princess was Chitralekh&aacute;, the daughter of Kubh&aacute;n&#769;d&#769;a, the minister of B&aacute;n&#769;a. "Of whom do you speak?" inquired she of Ush&aacute;. But the princess, recollecting herself, was ashamed, and remained silent. At length, however, Chitralekh&aacute; conciliated her confidence, and she related to her what had passed, and what the goddess had foretold; and she requested her friend to devise some means of uniting her with the person whom she had beheld in her dream.</p>  
<p>Chitralekh&aacute; then delineated the most eminent gods, demons, spirits, and mortals, and shewed them to Ush&aacute;. Putting aside the portraits of gods, spirits, snake-gods, and demons, the princess selected those of mortals, and amongst them the heroes of the races of Andhaka and Vrishn&#769;i. When she came to the likenesses of Krishn&#769;a and R&aacute;ma, she was confused with shame; from the portrait of Pradyumna she modestly averted her eyes; but the moment she beheld the picture of his son, the object of her passion, her eyes wide expanded, and all her bashfulness was discarded. "This is he! this is he!" said she to Chitralekh&aacute;; and her friend, who was endowed with magic power, bade her be of good cheer, and set off through the air to Dw&aacute;rak&aacute;.</p>
