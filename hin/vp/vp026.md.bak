Book Two

The second book opens with a continuation of the kings of the first
Manwantara; amongst whom, Bharata is said to have given a name to India,
called after him Bhárata-varsha. This leads to a detail of the
geographical system of the Puráńas, with mount Meru, the seven circular
continents, and their surrounding oceans, to the limits of the world;
all of which are mythological fictions, in which there is little reason
to imagine that any topographical truths are concealed. With regard to
Bhárata, or India, the case is different: the mountains and rivers which
are named are readily verifiable, and the cities and nations that are
particularized may also in many instances be proved to have had a real
existence. The list is not a very long one in the Vishńu Puráńa, and is
probably abridged from some more ample detail like that which the
Mahábhárata affords, and which, in the hope of supplying information'
with respect to a subject yet imperfectly investigated, the ancient
political condition of India, I have inserted and elucidated.

The description which this book also contains of the planetary and other
spheres is equally mythological, although occasionally presenting
practical details and notions in which there is an approach to accuracy.
The concluding legend of Bharata--in his former life the king so named,
but now a Brahman, who acquires true wisdom, and thereby attains
liberation--is palpably an invention of the compiler, and is peculiar to
this Puráńa.
