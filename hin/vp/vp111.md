### CHAP. XVIII.

Descendants of Anu. Countries and towns named after some of them, as
Anga, Banga, and others.

ANU <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1](#fn_1195.md), the fourth son of Yayáti,
had three sons, Sabhánara, Chákshusha, and Paramekshu <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[2](#fn_1196.md). The son of the first was
Kálánara <span id="fr_1197"></span>[3](#fn_1197.md); his son was Śrinjaya;
his son was Puranjaya; his son was Janamejaya; his son was
Mahámani <span id="fr_1198"></span>[4](#fn_1198.md); his son was Mahámanas,
who had two sons, Uśínara and Titikshu. Uśínara had five sons, Śivi,
Trińa <span id="fr_1199"></span>[5](#fn_1199.md), Gara <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[6](#fn_1200.md), Krimi, Dárvan <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[7](#fn_1201.md). Śivi had four sons, Vrishadarbha,
Suvíra, Kaikeya, and Madra <span id="fr_1202"></span>[8](#fn_1202.md).
Titikshu had one son, Ushadratha <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[9](#fn_1203.md); his son was Hema <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[10](#fn_1204.md); his son was Sutapas; his son was
Bali, on whose wife five sons were begotten by Dírghatamas, or Anga,
Banga, Kalinga, Suhma, and Puńd́ra <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[11](#fn_1205.md); and their descendants, and the five
countries they inhabited, were known by the same names <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[12](#fn_1206.md).

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span>

The son of Anga was Pára <span id="fr_1207"></span>[13](#fn_1207.md); his
son was Divaratha; his son was Dharmaratha <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[14](#fn_1208.md); his son was Chitraratha; his son was
Romapáda <span id="fr_1209"></span>[15](#fn_1209.md), also called
Daśaratha, to whom, being childless, Daśaratha, the son of Aja, gave his
daughter Śántá to be adopted <span id="fr_1210"></span>[16](#fn_1210.md).
After this, Romapáda had a son named Chaturanga; his son was
Prithuláksha; his son was Champa, who founded the city of Champá <span
id="fr_1211"></span>[17](#fn_1211.md). The son of Champa was Haryyanga; his
son was Bhadraratha, who had two sons, Vrihatkarman and Vrihadratha. The
son of the first was Vrihadbhánu <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[18](#fn_1212.md); his son was Vrihanmanas; his son was
Jayadratha, who, by a wife who was the daughter of a Kshatriya father
and Brahmani mother, had a son named Vijaya <span
id="fr_1213"></span>[19](#fn_1213.md);

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

his son was Dhriti; his son was Dhritavrata; his son was Satyakarman;
his son was Adhiratha <span id="fr_1214"></span>[20](#fn_1214.md), who
found Karna in a basket on the banks of the Ganges, where he had been
exposed by his mother, Pritha. The son of Karńa was Vrishasena <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[21](#fn_1215.md). These were the Anga kings. You shall
next hear who were the descendants of Puru.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[444:1](vp111.htm#fr_1195.md) By some
unaccountable caprice the Bráhma P. and Hari V., unsupported by any
other authority, here substitute for Anu the name of Kaksheyu, a
descendant of Puru, and transfer the whole series of his posterity to
the house of Puru.

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[444:2](vp111.htm#fr_1196.md) Paksha and
Parapaksha: Váyu. Parameshu: Matsya. Paroksha: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[444:3](vp111.htm#fr_1197.md) Kálánala: Váyu.
Koláhala: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[444:4](vp111.htm#fr_1198.md) Maháśála: Agni.
Maháśíla: Bhágav.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[444:5](vp111.htm#fr_1199.md) Nriga: Agni. Vana:
Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[444:6](vp111.htm#fr_1200.md) Nava: Matsya. Śama:
Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[444:7](vp111.htm#fr_1201.md) Vrata: Agni.
Suvrata: Matsya. Daksha: Bhágavata. According to the Bráhma P. and Hari
V. the five sons of Uśínara were the ancestors of different tribes. Śivi
was the progenitor of the Śaivas; Nriga of the Yaudheyas; Nava of the
Navarásht́ras; Vrata of the Ámbasht́has; and Krimi founded the city
Krimilá.

<span id="fn_1202"></span>[444:8](vp111.htm#fr_1202.md) Bhadra and
Bhadraka: Matsya, Agni. These sons of Śivi give name to different
provinces and tribes in the west and north-west of India.

<span id="fn_1203"></span>[444:9](vp111.htm#fr_1203.md) Rushadratha: Agni.
Tushadratha: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[444:10](vp111.htm#fr_1204.md) Pheńa: Agni. Sena:
Matsya.

<span id="fn_1205"></span>[444:11](vp111.htm#fr_1205.md) Odra, or in some
copies Andhra: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[444:12](vp111.htm#fr_1206.md) See [p.
185](vp061.htm#page_185). n. [3](vp061.htm#fn_479.md); [p.
188](vp061.htm#page_188). n. [46](vp061.htm#fn_522.md),
[49](vp061.htm#fn_525), [50](vp061.htm#fn_526.md); and [p.
190](vp061.htm#page_190). n. [73](vp061.htm#fn_549.md). Of Suhma it may be
remarked, that it is specified in the Siddhánta Kaumudí as an example of
Paniní's rule; 17.3.24; by which Nagara compounded with names of
countries in the east becomes Nágara, as Sauhmanágara, 'produced, &c. in
a city of Suhma.' The descendants of Anu, according to the Mahábhárata
were all Mlechchhas. The last named work, as well as the Váyu and Matsya
Puráńas, have an absurd story of the circumstances of the birth of
Dírghatamas, who was the son of Ujási or Utathya, the elder brother of
Vrihaspati by Mamatá, and of his begetting Anga <span id="page_445">p.
445</span> and the rest. They agree in assigning descendants of all four
castes to them; the Váyu stating that Bali had \#\#\# and the Matsya
ascribing it to a boon given by Brahmá to Bali: 'Do thou establish the
four perpetual castes.' Of these, the Brahmans are known as Báleyas:
\#\#\#. The Matsya calls Bali, the son of Virochana, and 'existing for a
whole Kalpa;' identifying him therefore, only in a different period and
form, with the Bali of the Vámana Avatára.

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[445:13](vp111.htm#fr_1207.md) Anápána: Váyu.
Khanápána: Bhágavata. Adhiváhana: Agni. Dadhivahana: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1208"></span>[445:14](vp111.htm#fr_1208.md) This prince is
said in the Váyu to have drank the Soma juice along with Indra.

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[445:15](vp111.htm#fr_1209.md) The Matsya and
Agni insert a Satyaratha.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[445:16](vp111.htm#fr_1210.md) This is noticed in
the Rámáyańa, in the story of the hermit Rishyaśringa, to whom Śántá was
given in marriage. Her adoptive father is called in the Rámáyańa, as the
is in the Agni and Matsya, Lomapáda: the meaning is the same, 'hairy
foot.' Rámáyańa, IX. X. See also Prelude to the Uttara Ráma Cheritra,
Hindu Theatre, I. 289.

<span id="fn_1211"></span>[445:17](vp111.htm#fr_1211.md) The Bhágavata
differs here from all the other authorities in omitting Champa, the
founder of Champapurí, a city of which traces still remain in the
vicinity of Bhagalpur, having inserted him previously amongst the
descendants of Ikshwáku (see [p. 373](vp095.htm#page_373.md). n.
[12](vp095.htm#fn_982).md). Champá is every where recognised as the capital
of Anga, and the translators of the Rámáyańa were very wide of the
truth, when they conjectured that it might be Angwa or Ava.

<span id="fn_1212"></span>[445:18](vp111.htm#fr_1212.md) Vrihaddarbha:
Bráhma. The Bhágavata omits the two successors of Champa, and makes
Vrihadratha, Vrihatkarman, and Vrihadbhánu, sons of Prithuláksha.

<span id="fn_1213"></span>[445:19](vp111.htm#fr_1213.md) The Váyu, Matsya,
and Hari V. make Vijaya the brother of Jayadratha. The Bhágavata agrees
with our text. The mother of Vijaya from her origin was of the Súta
caste, the genealogist and charioteer. Manu, X. 47. Her son was of the
same caste, children taking the caste of the mother: consequently the
descendants of Vijaya, kings of Anga, were Sútas; and this explains the
contemptuous application of the term Súta to Karńa, the half brother of
the Páńd́us; for he, as <span id="page_446">p. 446</span> will presently
be mentioned, was adopted into the Anga family, and succeeded to the
crown.

<span id="fn_1214"></span>[446:20](vp111.htm#fr_1214.md) Some variety
prevails in the series of princes here, but this arises from not
distinguishing the collateral lines, the descendants of Jayadratha from
those of Vijaya. The Váyu and Matsya give the latter as in our text, but
they agree also with the Agni and Bráhma in the successors of
Jayadratha, as Drid́haratha or Vrihadratha, and Janamejaya or Viśwajit.

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[446:21](vp111.htm#fr_1215.md) Súrasena: Váyu.
Vikarńa: Bráhma.
