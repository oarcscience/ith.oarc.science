### CHAP. III.

Division of the Veda into four portions, by a Vyása, in every Dwápara
age. List of the twenty-eight Vyásas of the present Manwantara. Meaning
of the word Brahma.

MAITREYA.--I have learnt from you, in due order, how this world is
Vishńu; how it is in Vishńu; how it is from Vishńu: nothing further is
to be known: but I should desire to hear how the Vedas were divided, in
different ages, by that great being, in the form of Veda-vyása? who were
the Vyásas of their respective eras? and what were the branches into
which the Vedas were distributed?

PARÁŚARA.--The branches of the great tree of the Vedas are so numerous,
Maitreya, that it is impossible to describe them at length. I will give
you a summary account of them.

In every Dwápara (or third) age, Vishńu, in the person of Vyása, in
order to promote the good of mankind, divides the Veda, which is
properly but one, into many portions: observing the limited
perseverance, energy, and application of mortals, he makes the Veda
fourfold, to adapt it to their capacities; and the bodily form which he
assumes, in order to effect that classification, is known by the name of
Veda-vyása. Of the different Vyásas in the present Manwantara <span
id="fr_781"></span>[1](#fn_781), and the branches which they have
taught, you shall have an account.

Twenty-eight times have the Vedas been arranged by the great Rishis in
the Vaivaswata Manwantara in the Dwápara age, and consequently eight and
twenty Vyásas have passed away; by whom, in their respective periods,
the Veda has been divided into four. In the first Dwápara age the
distribution was made by Swayambhu (Brahmá) himself; in the second, the
arranger of the Veda (Veda-vyása) was Prajápati (or Manu); in the third,
Uśanas; in the fourth, Vrihaspati; in the fifth, Savitri; in the sixth,
Mrityu (Death, or Yama); in the seventh, Indra; in the eighth,
Vaśisht́ha; in the ninth, Sáraswata; in the tenth, Tridháman; in

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

the eleventh, Trivrishan; in the twelfth, Bharadwája; in the thirteenth,
Antaríksha; in the fourteenth, Vapra; in the fifteenth, Trayyáruńa <span
id="fr_782"></span>[2](#fn_782); in the sixteenth, Dhananjaya; in the
[seventeenth](errata.htm#12), Kritanjaya; in the eighteenth, Rińa; in
the nineteenth, Bharadwája; in the twentieth, Gotama; in the
twenty-first, Uttama, also called Haryátmá; in the twenty-second, Veńa,
who is likewise named Rájaśravas; in the twenty-third, Somaśushmápańa,
also Trińavindu; in the twenty-fourth, Riksha, the descendant of Bhrigu,
who is known also by the name Válmíki; in the twenty-fifth, my father
Śakti was the Vyása; I was the Vyása of the twenty-sixth Dwápara, and
was succeeded by Jaratkáru; the Vyása of the twenty-eighth, who followed
him, was Krishńa Dwaipáyana. These are the twenty-eight elder Vyásas, by
whom, in the preceding Dwápara ages, the Veda has been divided into
four. In the next Dwápara, Drauńi (the son of Drońa) will be the Vyása,
when my son, the Muni Krishńa Dwaipáyana, who is the actual Vyása, shall
cease to be (in that character) <span id="fr_783"></span>[3](#fn_783).

The syllable Om is defined to be the eternal monosyllabic Brahma <span
id="fr_784"></span>[4](#fn_784). The word Brahma is derived from the
root Vriha (to increase), because it is infinite (spirit), and because
it is the cause by which the Vedas (and

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

all things) are developed. Glory to Brahma, who is addressed by that
mystic word, associated eternally with the triple universe <span
id="fr_785"></span>[5](#fn_785), and who is one with the four Vedas.
Glory to Brahma, who, alike in the destruction and renovation of the
world, is called the great and mysterious cause of the intellectual
principle (Mahat); who is without limit in time or space, and exempt
from diminution or decay; in whom (as connected with the property of
darkness) originates worldly illusion; and in whom resides the end of
soul (fruition or liberation), through the properties of light and of
activity (or goodness and foulness). He is the refuge of those who are
versed in the Sánkhya philosophy; of those who have acquired control
over their thoughts and passions. He is the invisible, imperishable
Brahma; varying in form, invariable in substance; the chief principle,
self-engendered; who is said to illuminate the caverns of the heart; who
is indivisible, radiant, undecaying, multiform. To that supreme Brahma
be for ever adoration.

That form of Vásudeva, who is the same with supreme spirit, which is
Brahma, and which, although diversified as threefold, is identical, is
the lord, who is conceived by those that contemplate variety in creation
to be distinct in all creatures. He, composed of the Rik, Sauna, and
Yajur-Vedas, is at the same time their essence, as he is the soul of all
embodied spirits. He, distinguished as consisting of the Vedas, creates
the Vedas, and divides them by many subdivisions into branches: he is
the author of those branches: he is those aggregated branches; for he,
the eternal lord, is the essence of true knowledge <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_781"></span>[272:1](vp077.htm#fr_781) The text has, 'Hear
from me an account of the Vyásas of the different Manwantaras;' but this
is inconsistent with what follows, in which the enumeration is confined
to the Vaivaswata Manwantara.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[273:2](vp077.htm#fr_782) This name occurs as
that of one of the kings of the solar dynasty, and is included by Mr.
Colebrooke amongst the persons of royal descent, who are mentioned as
authors of hymns in the Rig-veda. As. Res. VIII. 383.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[273:3](vp077.htm#fr_783) A similar list of
Vyásas is given in the Kúrma and Váyu Puráńas. Many of the individuals
appear as authors of different hymns and prayers in the Vedas; and it is
very possible that the greater portion, if not all of them, had a real
existence, being the framers or teachers of the religion of the Hindus
before a complete ritual was compiled.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[273:4](vp077.htm#fr_784) We have already had
occasion to explain the sanctity of this monosyllable (see [p.
1](vp035.htm#page_1), n. [1](vp035.htm#fn_98)), which ordinarily
commences different portions of the Vedas, and which, as the text
describes it, is identified with the supreme, undefinable deity, or
Brahma. So in the Bhagavad-gíta: 'Repeating Om, the monosyllable, which
is Brahma, and calling me to mind:' which is not exactly the same idea
that is conveyed by Schlegel's version; 'Monosyllabum mysticum Om
pronuntiando, numen adorans, mei memor;' where 'numen adorans,' although
it may be defended as necessary to the sense, is not expressed by the
words of the text, nor compatible with Hindu notions. In one of the MSS.
employed, the transcriber has evidently been afraid of desecrating this
sacred monosyllable, and has therefore altered the text, writing it
\#\#\# instead of \#\#\#.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[274:5](vp077.htm#fr_785) The daily prayers of
the Brahman commence with the formula, Om bhúh, bhuvah, swar: Om earth,
sky, heaven: these are the three mystical terms called Vyáhritis, and
are scarcely of less sanctity than the Prańava itself. Their efficacy,
and the order of their repetition preceding the Gáyatrí, are fully
detailed in Manu, II. 76-81. In the Mitákshara they are directed to be
twice repeated mentally, with Om prefixed to each; Om bhúh, Om bhuvah,
Om swar; the breath being suppressed by closing the lips and nostrils.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[274:6](vp077.htm#fr_786) The form or sensible
type of Vásudeva is here considered to be the monosyllable Om, and which
is one with the three mystical words, Bhúh, Bhuvar, Swar, and with the
Vedas: consequently the Vyáhritis and the Vedas are also forms of
Vásudeva, diversified as to their typical character, but essentially one
and the same.
