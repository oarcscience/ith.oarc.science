*The Vishnu Purana*, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson, \[1840\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1\. The Brahmá Puráńa

1\. Brahmá Puráńa. "That, the whole of which was formerly repeated by
Brahmá to Maríchi, is called the Bráhma Puráńa, and contains ten
thousand stanzas <span id="fr_32"></span>[33](#fn_32.md)." In all the lists
of the Puráńas, the Bráhma is placed at the head of the series, and is
thence sometimes also entitled the Ádi or 'first' Puráńa. It is also
designated as the Saura, as it is in great part appropriated to the
worship of Súrya, 'the sun.' There are, however, works bearing these
names which belong to the class of Upa-puráńas, and which are not to be
confounded with the Bráhma. It is usually said, as above, to contain ten
thousand slokas; but the number actually occurring is between seven and
eight thousand. There is a supplementary or concluding section called
the Brahmottara Puráńa, and which is different from a portion of the
Skánda called the Brahmottara Khańd́a, which contains about three
thousand stanzas more; but there is every reason to conclude that this
is a distinct and unconnected work.

The immediate narrator of the Brahmá Puráńa is Lomaharshańa, who
communicates it to the Rishis or sages assembled at Naimishárańya, as it
was originally revealed by Brahmá, not to Maríchi, as the Matsya
affirms, but to Daksha, another of the patriarchs: hence its
denomination of the Brahmá Puráńa.

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

The early chapters of this work give a description of the creation, an
account of the Manwantaras, and the history of the solar and lunar
dynasties to the time of Krishńa, in a summary manner, and in words
which are common to it and several other Puráńas: a brief description of
the universe succeeds; and then come a number of chapters relating to
the holiness of Orissa, with its temples and sacred groves dedicated to
the sun, to Śiva, and Jagannáth, the latter especially. These chapters
are characteristic of this Puráńa, and shew its main object to be the
promotion of the worship of Krishńa as Jagannáth <span
id="fr_33"></span>[34](#fn_33.md). To these particulars succeeds a life of
Krishńa, which is word for word the same as that of the Vishńu Puráńa;
and the compilation terminates with a particular detail of the mode in
which Yoga, or contemplative devotion, the object of which is still
Vishńu, is to be performed. There is little in this which corresponds
with the definition of a Pancha-lakshańa Puráńa; and the mention of the
temples of Orissa, the date of the original construction of which is
recorded <span id="fr_34"></span>[35](#fn_34.md), shews that it could not
have been compiled earlier than the thirteenth or fourteenth century.

The Uttara Khańd́a of the Bráhma P. bears still more entirely the
character of a Máhátmya, or local legend, being intended to celebrate
the sanctity of the Balajá river, conjectured to be the same as the
Banás in Marwar. There is no clue to its date, but it is clearly modern,
grafting personages and fictions of its own invention on a few hints
from older authorities <span id="fr_35"></span>[36](#fn_35.md).

<span id="fn_33"></span>[xvii:34](vp005.htm#fr_33.md) Col. Vans Kennedy
objects to this character of the Bráhma P., and observes that it
contains only two short descriptions of pagodas, the one of Konáditya,
the other of Jagannáth. In that case, his copy must differ considerably
from those I have met with; for in them the description of Purushottama
Kshetra, the holy land of Orissa, runs through forty chapters, or
one-third of the work. The description, it is true, is interspersed, in
the usual rambling strain of the Puráńas, with a variety of legends,
some ancient, some modern; but they are intended to illustrate some
local circumstance, and are therefore not incompatible with the main
design, the celebration of the glories of Purushottama Kshetra. The
specification of the temple of Jagannáth, however, is of itself
sufficient, in my opinion, to determine the character and era of the
compilation.
