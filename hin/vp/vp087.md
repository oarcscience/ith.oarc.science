### CHAP. XIII.

Of Śráddhas, or rites in honour of ancestors, to be performed on
occasions of rejoicing. Obsequial ceremonies. Of the Ekoddisht́a or
monthly Śráddha, and the Sapińd́ana or annual one. By whom to be
performed.

AURVA continued.--"The bathing of a father without disrobing is enjoined
when a son is born; and he is to celebrate the ceremony proper for the
event, which is the Śráddha offered upon joyous occasions <span
id="fr_867"></span>[1](#fn_867.md). With composed mind, and thinking on
nothing else, the Brahman should offer worship to both the gods and
progenitors, and should respectfully circumambulate, keeping Brahmans on
his left hand, and give them food. Standing with his face to the east,
he should present, with the

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

parts of the hand sacred to the gods and to Prajápati, balls of
food <span id="fr_868"></span>[2](#fn_868.md), with curds, unbruised grain,
and jujubes; and should perform, on every accession of good fortune, the
rite by which the class of progenitors termed Nándímukha is
propitiated <span id="fr_869"></span>[3](#fn_869.md). A householder should
diligently worship the Pitris so named, at the marriage of a son or
daughter, on entering a new dwelling, on giving a name to a child, on
performing his tonsure and other purificatory ceremonies, at the binding
of the mother's hair during gestation, or on first seeing the face of a
son, or the like.

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Śráddha on
such occasions, however, has been briefly alluded to. Hear now, oh king,
the rules for the performance of obsequial rites.

"Having washed the corpse with holy water, decorated it with garlands,
and burnt it without the village, the kinsmen, having bathed with their
clothes on, are to stand with their faces to the south, and offer
libations to the deceased, addressing him by name, and adding, 'wherever
thou mayest be <span id="fr_870"></span>[4](#fn_870.md).' They then return,
along with the cattle coming from pasture, to the village; and upon the
appearance of the stars retire to rest, sleeping on mats spread upon the
earth. Every day (whilst the mourning lasts) a cake or ball of
food <span id="fr_871"></span>[5](#fn_871.md) is to be placed on the
ground, as an offering to the deceased; and rice, without flesh, is to
be daily eaten. Brahmans are to be fed for as many days as the mourner
pleases, for the soul of the defunct derives satisfaction accordingly as
his relatives are content with their entertainment. On the first day, or
the third, or seventh, or ninth (after the death of a person), his
kinsmen should change their raiment, and bathe out of doors, and offer a
libation of water, with (tila) sesamum-seeds. On the fourth day <span
id="fr_872"></span>[6](#fn_872.md) the ashes and bones should be collected:
after which the body of one connected with the deceased by offerings of
funeral cakes may be touched (by an indifferent person), without thereby
incurring impurity; and those who are related only by presentation of
water are qualified for any occupation <span
id="fr_873"></span>[7](#fn_873.md).

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The former class
of relatives may use beds, but they must still refrain from unguents and
flowers, and must observe continence, after the ashes and bones have
been collected (until the mourning is over). When the deceased is a
child, or one who is abroad, or who has been degraded, or a spiritual
preceptor, the period of uncleanness is but brief, and the ceremonies
with fire and water are discretional. The food of a family in which a
kinsman is deceased is not to be partaken of for ten days <span
id="fr_874"></span>[8](#fn_874.md); and during that period, gifts,
acceptance, sacrifice, and sacred study are suspended. The term of
impurity for a Brahman is ten days; for a Kshatriya, twelve; for a
Vaiśya, half a month; and a whole month for a Śúdra <span
id="fr_875"></span>[9](#fn_875.md). On the first day after uncleanness
ceases, the nearest relation of the deceased should feed Brahmans at his
pleasure, but in uneven numbers, and offer to the deceased a ball of
rice upon holy grass placed near the residue of the food that has been
eaten. After the guests have been fed, the mourner, according to his
caste, is to touch water, a weapon, a goad, or a staff, as he is
purified by such contact. He may then resume the duties prescribed for
his caste, and follow the avocation ordinarily pursued by its members.

"The Śráddha enjoined for an individual is to be repeated on the day of
his death (in each month for a year) <span
id="fr_876"></span>[10](#fn_876.md), but without the prayers and rites
performed on the first occasion, and without offerings to the
Viśwadevas. A single ball of food is to be offered to the deceased, as
the purification of one person, and Brahmans are to be fed. The Brahmans
are to be asked by the sacrificer if they are satisfied; and upon their
assent, the prayer, 'May this ever satisfy such a one' (the deceased) is
to be recited.

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

"This is the Śráddha called Ekoddisht́a, which is to be performed monthly
to the end of a twelvemonth from the death of a person; at the
expiration of which the ceremony called Sapińd́ana is to be observed. The
practices of this rite are the same as those of the monthly obsequies,
but a lustration is to be made with four vessels of water, perfumes, and
sesamum: one of these vessels is considered as dedicated to the
deceased, the other three to the progenitors in general; and the
contents of the former are to be transferred to the other three, by
which the deceased becomes included in the class of ancestors, to whom
worship is to be addressed with all the ceremonies of the Śráddha. The
persons who are competent to perform the obsequies of relations
connected by the offering of the cake are the son, grandson, great
grandson, a kinsman of the deceased, the descendants of a brother, or
the posterity of one allied by funeral offerings. In absence of all
these, the ceremony may be instituted by those related by presentations
of water only, or those connected by offerings of cakes or water to
maternal ancestors. Should both families in the male line be extinct,
the last obsequies may be performed by women, or by the associates of
the deceased in religious or social institutions, or by any one who
becomes possessed of the property of a deceased kinsman.

"Obsequial rites are of three descriptions, initiative, intermediate,
and subsequent <span id="fr_877"></span>[11](#fn_877.md). The first are
those which are observed after the burning of the corpse until the
touching of water, weapons, &c. (or until the cessation of uncleanness).
The intermediate ceremonies are the Sráddhas called Ekoddisht́a, which
are offered every month: and the subsequent rites are those which follow
the Sapińd́ikarańa, when the deceased is admitted amongst the ancestors
of his race; and the ceremonies are thenceforth general or ancestral.
The first set of rites (as essential) are to be performed by the kindred
of the father or mother, whether connected by the offering of the cake
or of water, by the associates of the deceased, or by the prince who
inherits his property.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The first and the
last rites are both to be performed by sons and other relations, and by
daughter's sons, and their sons; and so are the sacrifices on the day of
the person's death. The last class, or ancestral rites, are to be
performed annually, with the same ceremonies as are enjoined for the
monthly obsequies; and they may be also performed by females. As the
ancestral rights are therefore most universal, I will describe to you,
oh king, at what seasons, and in what manner, they should be
celebrated."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_867"></span>[314:1](vp087.htm#fr_867.md) The offerings of the
Hindus to the Pitris partake of the character of those of the Romans to
the lares and manes, but bear a more conspicuous part in their ritual.
They are said indeed by Manu (III. 203), in words repeated in the Váyu
and Matsya Puráńas and Hari Vanśa, to be of more moment than the worship
of the gods: These ceremonies are not to be regarded as merely
obsequial; for independently of the rites addressed to a recently
deceased relative, and in connexion with him to remote ancestors and to
the progenitors of all beings, which are of a strictly obsequial or
funereal description, offerings to deceased ancestors, and the Pitris in
general, form an essential ceremony on a great variety of festive and
domestic occasions. The Nirńaya Sindhu, in a passage referred to by Mr.
Colebrooke (As. Res. VII.), specifies the following Śráddhas: 1. The
Nitya, or perpetual; daily offerings to ancestors in general: 2. The
Naimittika, or occasional; as the Ekoddisht́a,or obsequial offerings on
account of a kinsman recently deceased: 3. The Kámya, voluntary;
performed for the accomplishment of a special design: 4. The Vriddhi;
performed on occasions of rejoicing or prosperity: 5. The Sapińd́ana;
offerings to all individual and to general ancestors: 6. The Párvańa
Śráddha; offerings to the manes on certain lunar days called Parvas, or
day of full moon and new moon, and the eighth and fourteenth days of the
lunar fortnight: 7. The Gosht́hi; for the advantage of a number of
learned persons, or of an assembly of Brahmans, invited for the purpose:
8. The Śuddhi; one performed to purify a person from some defilement; an
expiatory Śráddha: 9. The Karmánga; one forming part of the initiatory
ceremonies, or Sanskáras, observed at conception, birth, tonsure, &c.:
10. The Daiva; to which the gods are invited: 11. The Yátrá Śráddha;
held by a person going a journey: and 12. The Pusht́i Śráddha; one
performed to promote health and <span id="page_315">p. 315</span>
wealth. Of these, the four which are considered the most solemn are the
rite performed for a parent, or near relative, lately deceased; that
which is performed for kindred collectively; that observed on certain
lunar days; and that celebrated on occasions of rejoicing. Nirńaya
Sindhu, p. 271.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[315:2](vp087.htm#fr_868.md) Manu directs the
balls to be made from the remainder of the clarified butter constituting
the previous oblation to the gods. III. 215. Kullúka Bhat́t́a explains,
however, the oblation to consist partly of Anna food, or boiled rice.
The latter is the article of which the balls chiefly consist.
Yájnawalkya directs them to be made of rice and sesamum-seeds. The Váyu
P. adds to these two ingredients, honey and butter: but various kinds of
fruit, of pulse, and of grain, and water, frankincense, sugar, and milk,
are also mixed up in the Pińd́as. Their size also differs; and according
to Angiras, as quoted by Hemádri in the Śráddha Mayúkha, they may be of
the dimension of the fruit of the jujube, or of the hog-plum, of the
fruit of the Bel, or of the wood-apple, or of a fowl's egg. Some
authorities direct Pińd́as of a different size for different Śráddhas;
prescribing them no larger than the wood-apple at the first or pure
funereal ceremony, and as big as a cocoa-nut at the monthly and annual
Śráddha. In practice the Pińd́a is usually of such a magnitude that it
may be conveniently held by the hand.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[315:3](vp087.htm#fr_869.md) We have here the
authority of the text for classing the Nándímukhas amongst the Pitris
(see p. 297): the verse is \#\#\#, and the same Gańa or class is
presently again named: \#\#\# The Mantra of the Vriddhi or festival
Śráddha is also said, in the Nirńaya Sindhu, to be \#\#\#. According to
the authorities, however, which are cited in that work, there seems to
be some uncertainty about the character of the Nándímukhas; and they are
addressed both as Pitris and gods: being in the former case either the
ancestors prior to the great grandfather, ancestors collectively, or a
certain class of them; and in the latter, being identified with the
Viśwadevas, or a class of them called also Úrddhavaktra. The term
Nándímukha is also applied to the rite itself, or to the Vriddhi
Śráddha, and to one addressed to maternal ancestors. Nirńaya Sindhu, p.
268, &c.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[316:4](vp087.htm#fr_870.md) "An oblation of water
must be next presented from the joined palms of the hand, naming the
deceased and the family from which he sprang, and saying, 'May this
oblation reach thee.'" As. Res. VII. 244. The text has, \#\#\#.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[316:5](vp087.htm#fr_871.md) The proper period of
mourning is ten days, on each of which offerings of cakes, and libations
of water, are to be made to the deceased, augmenting the number of cakes
each day, so that on the last day ten cakes are presented. When the
period is shorter, the same number of ten cakes must be distributed
amongst the several days, or they may be all presented on one day.
Nirńaya Sindhu, p. 429.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[316:6](vp087.htm#fr_872.md) It should be, more
correctly, on that day on which the mourning ceases, or, as previously
mentioned, the first, third, seventh, or ninth; but the authorities
vary, and, besides these, the second and fourth days, and certain days
of the fortnight or month, are specified. Nirńaya Sindhu, p. 432.

<span id="fn_873"></span>[316:7](vp087.htm#fr_873.md) They are no longer
unclean. The Sapińd́as, or those connected by offerings of cakes to
common ancestors, extend to seven degrees, ascending or descending. The
Samánodakas, or those similarly connected by presentations of water, to
fourteen degrees.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[317:8](vp087.htm#fr_874.md) That is, a mere guest
or stranger is not to partake of it. The food directed to be given to
Brahmans is given in general only to the relatives of the deceased, who
are already unclean. In this respect our text and the modern practice
seem to differ from the primitive system, as described by Manu, III.
187. The eleventh or twelfth day is the term on which the Śráddha which
crowns the whole of the funeral rites is to be performed, and when
Brahmans are to be invited. Nirńaya Sindhu, p. 437.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[317:9](vp087.htm#fr_875.md) The number of Pińd́as,
however, is for each case the same, or ten. Nirńaya Sindhu, p. 429.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[317:10](vp087.htm#fr_876.md) So Manu, III. 251.
It may be doubted if the monthly Śráddha was part <span id="page_318">p.
318</span> of the ancient system, although Kullúka Bhat́t́a supposes it to
be referred to (v. 548), and supplies the fancied omission of the text.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[318:11](vp087.htm#fr_877.md) Púrva, 'first;'
Madhyama, 'middle;' and Uttara, 'last.'
