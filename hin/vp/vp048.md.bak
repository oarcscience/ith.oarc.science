### CHAP. XIII.

Posterity of Dhruva. Legend of Veńa: his impiety: he is put to death by
the Rishis. Anarchy ensues. The production of Nisháda and Prithu: the
latter the first king. The origin of Súta and Mágadha: they enumerate
the duties of kings. Prithu compels Earth to acknowledge his authority:
he levels it: introduces cultivation: erects cities. Earth called after
him Prithiví: typified as a cow.

PARÁŚARA.--The sons of Dhruva, by his wife Śambhu, were Bhavya and
Slisht́i. [Suchcháyá](errata.htm#5.md), the wife of the latter, was the
mother of five virtuous sons, Ripu, Ripunjaya, Vipra, Vrikala, and
Vrikatejas. The son of Ripu, by Vrihatí, was the illustrious Chakshusha,
who begot the Manu Chákshusha on Pushkarińí, of the family of Varuńa,
the daughter of the venerable patriarch Anarańya. The Manu had, by his
wife Navalá, the daughter of the patriarch Vairája, ten noble sons, Uru,
Pura, Satadyumna, Tapaswí, Satyavák, Kavi, Agnisht́oma, Atirátra,
Sudyumna, and Abhimanyu. The wife of Uru, Ágneyí, bore six excellent
sons, Anga, Sumanas, Swáti, Kratu, Angiras, and Śiva. Anga had, by his
wife Suníthá, only one son, named Veńa, whose right arm was rubbed by
the Rishis, for the purpose of producing from it progeny. From the arm
of Veńa, thus rubbed, sprang a celebrated monarch, named Prithu, by
whom, in olden time, the earth was milked for the advantage of
mankind <span id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_265.md).

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

MAITREYA.--Best of Munis, tell me why was the right hand of Veńa rubbed
by the holy sages, in consequence of which the heroic Prithu was
produced.

PARÁŚARA.--Suníthá was originally the daughter of Mrityu, by whom she
was given to Anga to wife. She bore him Veńa, who inherited the evil
propensities of his maternal grandfather. When he was inaugurated by the
Rishis monarch of the earth, he caused. it to be every where proclaimed,
that no worship should be performed, no oblations offered, no gifts
bestowed upon the Brahmans. "I, the king," said he, "am the lord of
sacrifice; for who but I am entitled to the oblations." The Rishis,
respectfully approaching the sovereign, addressed him in melodious
accents, and said, "Gracious prince, we salute you; hear what we have to
represent. For the preservation of your kingdom and your life, and for
the benefit of all your subjects, permit us to worship Hari, the lord of
all sacrifice, the god of gods, with solemn and protracted rites <span
id="fr_266"></span>[2](#fn_266.md); a portion of the fruit of which will
revert to you <span id="fr_267"></span>[3](#fn_267.md). Vishńu, the god of
oblations, being propitiated with sacrifice by us, will grant you, oh
king, all your desires. Those princes have all their wishes gratified,
in whose realms Hari, the lord of sacrifice, is adored with sacrificial
rites." "Who," exclaimed Veńa, "is superior to me? who besides me is
entitled to worship? who is this Hari, whom you style the lord of
sacrifice? Brahmá, Janárddana. Śambhu, Indra, Váyu, Ravi (the sun),
Hutabhuk

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (fire), Varuńa,
Dhátá, Púshá, (the sun), Bhúmi (earth), the lord of night (the moon);
all these, and whatever other gods there be who listen to our vows; all
these are present in the person of a king: the essence of a sovereign is
all that is divine. Conscious of this, I have issued my commands, and
look that you obey them. You are not to sacrifice, not to offer
oblations, not to give alms. As the first duty of women is obedience to
their lords, so observance of my orders is incumbent, holy men, on you."
"Give command, great king," replied the Rishis, "that piety may suffer
no decrease. All this world is but a transmutation of oblations; and if
devotion be suppressed, the world is at an end." But Veńa was entreated
in vain; and although this request was repeated by the sages, he refused
to give the order they suggested. Then those pious Munis were filled
with wrath, and cried out to each other, "Let this wicked wretch be
slain. The impious man who has reviled the god of sacrifice who is
without beginning or end, is not fit to reign over the earth." And they
fell upon the king, and beat him with blades of holy grass, consecrated
by prayer, and slew him, who had first been destroyed by his impiety
towards god.

Afterwards the Munis beheld a great dust arise, and they said to the
people who were nigh, "What is this?" and the people answered and said,
"Now that the kingdom is without a king, the dishonest men have begun to
seize the property of their neighbours. The great dust that you behold,
excellent Munis, is raised by troops of clustering robbers, hastening to
fall upon their prey." The sages, hearing this, consulted, and together
rubbed the thigh of the king, who had left no offspring, to produce a
son. From the thigh, thus rubbed, came forth a being of the complexion
of a charred stake, with flattened features (like a negro), and of
dwarfish stature. "What am I to do?" cried he eagerly to the Munis. "Sit
down" (Nishida), said they; and thence his name was Nisháda. His
descendants, the inhabitants of the Vindhya mountain, great Muni, are
still called Nishádas, and are characterized by the exterior tokens of
depravity <span id="fr_268"></span>[4](#fn_268.md). By this means the
wickedness of Versa was expelled; those

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nishádas being
born of his sins, and carrying them away. The Brahmans then proceeded to
rub the right arm of the king, from which friction was engendered the
illustrious son of Veńa, named Prithu, resplendent in person, as if the
blazing deity of Fire bad been manifested.

There then fell from the sky the primitive bow (of Mahádeva) named
Ajagava, and celestial arrows, and panoply from heaven. At the birth of
Prithu all living creatures rejoiced; and Veńa, delivered by his being
born from the hell named Put, ascended to the realms above. The seas and
rivers, bringing jewels from their depths, and water to perform the
ablutions of his installation, appeared. The great parent of all,
Brahmá, with the gods and the descendants of Angiras (the fires), and
with all things animate or inanimate, assembled and performed the
ceremony of consecrating the son of Veńa. Beholding in his right hand
the (mark of the) discus of Vishńu, Brahmá recognised a portion of that
divinity in Prithu, and was much pleased; for the mark of Vishńu's
discus is visible in the hand of one who is born to be a universal
emperor <span id="fr_269"></span>[5](#fn_269.md), one whose power is
invincible even by the gods.

The mighty Prithu, the son of Veda, being thus invested with universal
dominion by those who were skilled in the rite, soon removed the
grievances of the people whom his father had oppressed, and from winning

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

their affections he derived the title of Rája, or king <span
id="fr_270"></span>[6](#fn_270.md). The waters became solid, when he
traversed the ocean: the mountains opened him a path: his banner passed
unbroken (through the forests): the earth needed not cultivation; and at
a thought food was prepared: all kine were like the cow of plenty: honey
was stored in every flower. At the sacrifice of the birth of Prithu,
which was performed by Brahmá, the intelligent Súta (herald or bard) was
produced, in the juice of the moon-plant, on the very birth-day <span
id="fr_271"></span>[7](#fn_271.md): at that great sacrifice also was
produced the accomplished Mágadha: and the holy sages said to these two
persons, "Praise ye the king Prithu, the illustrious son of Veńa; for
this is your especial function, and here is a fit subject for your
praise." But they respectfully replied to the Brahmans, "We know not the
acts of the new-born king of the earth; his merits are not understood by
us; his fame is not spread abroad: inform us upon what subject we may
dilate in his praise." "Praise the king," said the Rishis, "for the acts
this heroic monarch will perform; praise him for the virtues he will
display."

The king, hearing these words, was much pleased, and reflected that
persons acquire commendation by virtuous actions, and that consequently
his virtuous conduct would be the theme of the eulogium which the bards
were about to pronounce: whatever merits, then, they should panegyrize
in their encomium, he determined that he would endeavour to acquire; and
if they should point out what faults ought to be avoided, he would try
to shun them. He therefore listened attentively, as the sweet-voiced
encomiasts celebrated the future virtues of Prithu, the enlightened son
of Veńa.

"The king is a speaker of truth, bounteous, an observer of his promises;
he is wise, benevolent, patient, valiant, and a terror to the wicked; he
knows his duties; he acknowledges services; he is compassionate and

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

kind-spoken; he respects the venerable; he performs sacrifices; he
reverences the Brahmans; he cherishes the good; and in administering
justice is indifferent to friend or foe."

The virtues thus celebrated by the Súta and the Magadhá were cherished
in the remembrance of the Rája, and practised by him when occasion
arose. Protecting this earth, the monarch performed many great
sacrificial ceremonies, accompanied by liberal donations. His subjects
soon approached him, suffering from the famine by which they were
afflicted, as all the edible plants had perished during the season of
anarchy. In reply to his question of the cause of their coming, they
told him, that in the interval in which the earth was without a king all
vegetable products had been withheld, and that consequently the people
had perished. "Thou," said they, "art the bestower of subsistence to us;
thou art appointed, by the creator, the protector of the people: grant
us vegetables, the support of the lives of thy subjects, who are
perishing with hunger."

On hearing this, Prithu took up his divine bow Ajagava, and his
celestial arrows, and in great wrath marched forth to assail the Earth.
Earth, assuming the figure of a cow, fled hastily from him, and
traversed, through fear of the king, the regions of Brahmá and the
heavenly spheres; but wherever went the supporter of living things,
there she beheld Vaińya with uplifted weapons: at last, trembling with
terror, and anxious to escape his arrows, the Earth addressed Prithu,
the hero of resistless prowess. "Know you not, king of men," said the
Earth, "the sin of killing a female, that you thus perseveringly seek to
slay me." The prince replied; "When the happiness of many is secured by.
the destruction of one malignant being, the death of that being is an
act of virtue." "But," said the Earth, "if, in order to promote the
welfare of your subjects, you put an end to me, whence, best of
monarchs, will thy people derive their support." "Disobedient to my
rule," rejoined Prithu, "if I destroy thee, I will support my people by
the efficacy of my own devotions." Then the Earth, overcome with
apprehension, and trembling in every limb, respectfully saluted the
king, and thus spake: "All undertakings are successful, if suitable
means of effecting them are employed.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I will impart to
you means of success, which you can make use of if you please. All
vegetable products are old, and destroyed by me; but at your command I
will restore them, as developed from my milk. Do you therefore, for the
benefit of mankind, most virtuous of princes, give me that calf, by
which I may be able to secrete milk. Make also all places level, so that
I may cause my milk, the seed of all vegetation, to flow every where
around."

Prithu accordingly uprooted the mountains, by hundreds and thousands,
for myriads of leagues, and they were thenceforth piled upon one
another. Before his time there were no defined boundaries of villages or
towns, upon the irregular surface of the earth; there was no
cultivation, no pasture, no agriculture, no highway for merchants: all
these things (or all civilization) originated in the reign of Prithu.
Where the ground was made level, the king induced his subjects to take
up their abode. Before his time, also, the fruits and roots which
constituted the food of the people were procured with great difficulty,
all vegetables having been destroyed; and he therefore, having made
Swáyambhuva Manu the calf <span id="fr_272"></span>[8](#fn_272.md), milked
the Earth, and received the milk into his own hand, for the benefit of
mankind. Thence proceeded all kinds of corn and vegetables upon which
people subsist now and perpetually. By granting life to the Earth,
Prithu was as her father, and she thence derived the patronymic
appellation Prithiví (the daughter of Prithu). Then the gods, the sages,
the demons, the Rákshasas, the Gandharbhas, Yakshas, Pitris, serpents,
mountains, and trees, took a milking vessel suited to their kind, and
milked the earth of appropriate milk, and the milker and the calf were
both peculiar to their own species <span
id="fr_273"></span>[9](#fn_273.md).

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

This Earth, the mother, the nurse, the receptacle, and nourisher of all
existent things, was produced from the sole of the foot of Vishńu. And
thus was born the mighty Prithu, the heroic son of Veńa, who was the
lord of the earth, and who, from conciliating the affections of the
people, was the first ruler to whom the title of Rája was ascribed.
Whoever shall recite this story of the birth of Prithu, the son of Veńa,
shall never suffer any retribution for the evil he may have committed:
and such is the virtue of the tale of Prithu's birth, that those who
hear it repeated shall be relieved from affliction <span
id="fr_274"></span>[10](#fn_274.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_265"></span>[98:1](vp048.htm#fr_265.md) The descent of Puru
from Dhruva is similarly traced in the Matsya Puráńa, but with some
variety of nomenclature: thus the wife of Dhruva is named Dhanyá; and
the eldest son of the Manu, Taru. The Váyu introduces another
generation, making the eldest son of Slisht́i, or as there termed Pusht́i,
father of Udáradhí; and the latter the father of Ripu, the father of
Chakshusha, the father of the Manu. The Bhágavata has an almost entirely
different set of names, having converted the family of Dhruva into
personifications of divisions of time and of day and night. The account
there given is, Dhruva had, by his wife Bhramí (revolving), the daughter
of Śiśumára (the sphere), Kalpa and Vatsara. The latter married Suvíthi,
and had six sons, Pushpárńa, Tigmaketu, Isha, Urjja, Vasu, Jaya. The
first married Prabhá and Doshá, and had by the former, Prátah (dawn),
Madhyadina (noon), and Sáya (evening); and by the latter, Pradosha,
Niśítha, and Vyusht́a, or the beginning, middle, and end of night. The
last has, by Pushkarińí, Chakshush, married <span id="page_99">p.
99</span> to Ákúti, and the father of Chákshusha Manu. He has twelve
sons, Puru, Kritsna, Rita, Dyumna, Satyavat, Dhrita, Vrata, Agnisht́oma,
Atirátra, Pradyumna, Sivi, and Ulmuka. The last is the father of six
sons, named as in our text, except the last, who is called Gaya. The
eldest, Anga, is the father of Veńa, the father of Prithu. These
additions are evidently the creatures of the author's imagination. The
Bráhma Puráńa and Hari Vanśa have the same genealogy as the Vishńu,
reading, as do the Matsya and Váyu, Pushkarini or Vírańí, the daughter
of Vírańá, instead of Varuńa. They, as well as copies of the text,
present several other varieties of nomenclature. The Padma P. (Bhúmi
Khańd́a) says Anga was of the family of Atri, in allusion perhaps to the
circumstance mentioned in the Bráhma P. of Uttánapáda's adoption by that
Rishi.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[99:2](vp048.htm#fr_266.md) With the Dírghasatra,
'long sacrifice;' a ceremony lasting a thousand years.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[99:3](vp048.htm#fr_267.md) That is, the land will
be fertile in proportion as the gods are propitiated, and the king will
benefit accordingly, as a sixth part of the merit and of the produce
will be his. So the commentator explains the word 'portion.'

<span id="fn_268"></span>[100:4](vp048.htm#fr_268.md) The Matsya says there
were born outcast or barbarous races, Mlechchas, as black as collyrium.
The Bhágavata describes an individual of dwarfish <span id="page_101">p.
101</span> stature, with short arms and legs, of a complexion as black
as a crow, with projecting chin, broad flat nose, red eyes, and tawny
hair; whose descendants were mountaineers and foresters: The Padma (Bhu.
Kh.) has a similar description, adding to the dwarfish stature and black
complexion, a wide mouth, large ears, and a protuberant belly. It also
particularizes his posterity as Nishádas, Kirátas, Bhillas, Bahanakas,
Bhramaras, Pulindas, and other barbarians, or Mlechchas, living in woods
and on mountains. These passages intend, and do not much exaggerate, the
uncouth appearance of the Goands, Koles, Bhils, and other uncivilized
tribes, scattered along the forests and mountains of central India, from
Behar to Kandesh, and who are not improbably the predecessors of the
present occupants of the cultivated portions of the country. They are
always very black, ill-shapen, and dwarfish, and have countenances of a
very African character.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[101:5](vp048.htm#fr_269.md) A Chakra-verttí, or,
according to the text, one in whom the Chakra, the discus of Vishńu,
abides (varttate); such a figure being delineated by the lines of the
hand. The grammatical etymology is, 'he who abides in, or rules over, an
extensive territory called a Chakra.'

<span id="fn_270"></span>[102:6](vp048.htm#fr_270.md) From rága, 'passion'
or 'affection;' but the more obvious etymology is ráj, to shine' or 'be
splendid.'

<span id="fn_271"></span>[102:7](vp048.htm#fr_271.md) The birth of Prithu
is to be considered as the sacrifice, of which Brahmá, the creator, was
the performer; but in other places, as in the Padma, it is considered
that an actual sacrificial rite was celebrated, at which the first
encomiasts were produced. The Bhágavata does not account for their
appearance.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[104:8](vp048.htm#fr_272.md) 'Having willed or
determined the Manu Swáyambhuva to be the calf:' \#\#\#. So the Padma
P.: \#\#\#. The Bhágavata has, 'Having made the Manu the calf.' By the
calf,' or Manu in that character, is typified, the commentator observes,
the promoter of the multiplication of progeny: \#\#\#.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[104:9](vp048.htm#fr_273.md) The Matsya, Bráhma,
Bhágavata, and Padma enter into a greater detail of this milking,
specifying typically the calf, the milker, the milk, and the vessel.
Thus, according to the Matsya, the Rishis milked the earth through
Vrihaspati; their calf <span id="page_105">p. 105</span> was Soma; the
Vedas were the vessel; and the milk was devotion. When the gods milked
the earth, the milker was Mitra (the sun); Indra was the calf;
superhuman power was the produce. The gods had a gold, the Pitris a
silver vessel: and for the latter, the milker was Antaka (death); Yama
was the calf; the milk was Swadhá, or oblation. The Nága, or snake-gods,
had a gourd for their pail; their calf was Takshaka; Dhritarásht́ra (the
serpent) was their milker; and their milk was poison. For the Asuras,
Máyá was the milk; Virochana, the son of Prahláda, was the calf; the
milker was Dwimurddhá; and the vessel was of iron. The Yakshas made
Vaisravańa their calf; their vessel was of unbaked earth; the milk was
the power of disappearing. The Rákshasas and others employed Raupyanábha
as the milker; their calf was Sumáli; and their milk was blood.
Chitraratha was the calf, Vasuruchi the milker, of the Gandharbas and
nymphs, who milked fragrant odours into a cup of lotus leaves. On behalf
of the mountains, Meru was the milker; Himavat the calf; the pail was of
crystal; and the milk was of herbs and gems. The trees extracted sap in
a vessel of the Paláśa, the Sál being the milker, and the Plaksha the
calf. The descriptions that occur in the Bhágavata, Padma, and Bráhma
Puráńas are occasionally slightly varied, but they are for the most part
in the same words as that of the Matsya. These mystifications are all
probably subsequent modifications of the original simple allegory, which
typified the earth as a cow, who yielded to every class of beings the
milk they desired, or the object of their wishes.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[105:10](vp048.htm#fr_274.md) Another reading is,
'It counteracts evil dreams.' The legend of Prithu is briefly given in
the Mahábhárata, Rája Dherma, and occurs in most of the Puráńas, but in
greatest detail in our text, in the Bhágavata, and especially in the
Padma, Bhúmi Khańd́a, s. 29, 30. All the versions, however, are
essentially the same.
