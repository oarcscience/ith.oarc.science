### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1189"></span>[443:1](vp110.htm#fr_1189.md) Also Áraddha in
MSS., and Árat́t́a, Matsya, which last seems to be the preferable reading.
The Váyu has Áruddha; the Bráhma, Angárasetu; but Árat́t́a is a northern
country, contiguous to, or synonymous with, Gándhára.

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[443:2](vp110.htm#fr_1190.md) Of Gándhára it is
said in the Váyu that it is a large country named after him, and is
famous for its breed of horses: \#\#\#. The Matsya reads the beginning
of the second line \#\#\#, shewing that Árat́t́a and Gándhára are much the
same. See [p. 191](vp061.htm#page_191). n. [83](vp061.htm#fn_559.md).

<span id="fn_1191"></span>[443:3](vp110.htm#fr_1191.md) The Bráhma P. and
Hari V., in opposition to all the rest, make Dharma and his successors
the descendants of Anu.

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[443:4](vp110.htm#fr_1192.md) Ghrita: Agni.

<span id="fn_1193"></span>[443:5](vp110.htm#fr_1193.md) Durdama: Váyu and
Bhágavata. The Matsya, Bráhma, and Agni insert a Vidupa, Duduha, or
Vidula, before Prachetas.

<span id="fn_1194"></span>[443:6](vp110.htm#fr_1194.md) So the Bhágavata
and Matsya. The Mahábhárata says the descendants of Druhya are the
Vaibhojas, a people unacquainted with the use of cars or beasts of
burden, and who travel on rafts: they have no kings.
