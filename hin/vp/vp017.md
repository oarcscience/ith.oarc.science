13\. The Skanda Puráńa

13\. Skanda Puráńa. "The Skánda Puráńa is that in which the six-faced
deity (Skanda) has related the events of the Tatpurusha Kalpa, enlarged
with many tales, and subservient to the duties taught by Maheśwara. It
is said to contain eighty-one thousand one hundred stanzas: so it is
asserted amongst mankind  <span id="fr_69"></span>[70](#fn_69.md)."

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

It is uniformly agreed that the Skanda Puráńa in a collective form has
no existence; and the fragments in the shape of Sanhitás, Khańd́as, and
Máhátmyas, which are affirmed in various parts of India to be portions
of the Puráńa, present a much more formidable mass of stanzas than even
the immense number of which it is said to consist. The most celebrated
of these portions in Hindustan is the Káśí Khańd́a, a very minute
description of the temples of Śiva in or adjacent to Benares, mixed with
directions for worshipping Maheśwara, and a great variety of legends
explanatory of its merits, and of the holiness of Káśí: many of them are
puerile and uninteresting, but some are of a higher character. The story
of Agastya records probably, in a legendary style, the propagation of
Hinduism in the south of India: and in the history of Divodása, king of
Káśí, we have an embellished tradition of the temporary depression of
the worship of Śiva, even in its metropolis, before the ascendancy of
the followers of Buddha <span id="fr_70"></span>[71](#fn_70.md), There is
every reason to believe the greater part of the contents of the Káśí
Khańd́a anterior to the first attack upon Benares by Mahmud of Ghizni.
The Káśí Khańd́a alone contains fifteen thousand stanzas.

Another considerable work ascribed in upper India to the Skanda Puráńa
is the Utkala Khańd́a, giving an account of the holiness of Urissa, and
the Kshetra of Purushottama or Jagannátha. The same vicinage is the site
of temples, once of great magnificence and extent, dedicated to Śiva, as
Bhuvaneśwara, which forms an excuse for attaching an account of a
Vaishńava Tírtha to an eminently Śaiva Puráńa. There can be little
doubt, however, that the Utkala Khańd́a is unwarrantably included amongst
the progeny of the parent work. Besides these, there is a Brahmottara
Khańd́a, a Revá Khańd́a, a Śiva Rahasya Khańd́a, a Himavat Khańd́a, and
others. Of the Sanhitás, the chief are the Súta Sanhitá, Sanatkumára
Sanhitá, Saura Sanhitá, and Kapila Sanhitá: there are several other
works denominated Sanhitás. The

<span id="page_xlvii">p. xlvii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Máhátmyas are more
numerous still <span id="fr_71"></span>[72](#fn_71.md). According to the
Súta Sanhitá, as quoted by Col. Vans Kennedy <span
id="fr_72"></span>[73](#fn_72.md), the Skanda Puráńa contains six Sanhitás,
five hundred Khańd́as, and five hundred thousand stanzas; more than is
even attributed to all the Puráńas. He thinks, judging from internal
evidence, that all the Khańd́as and Sanhitás may be admitted to be
genuine, though the Máhátmyas have rather a questionable appearance. Now
one kind of internal evidence is the quantity; and as no more than
eighty-one thousand one hundred stanzas have ever been claimed for it,
all in excess above that amount must be questionable. But many of the
Khańd́as, the Káśí Khańd́a for instance, are quite as local as the
Máhátmyas, being legendary stories relating to the erection and sanctity
of certain temples or groups of temples, and to certain Lingas; the
interested origin of which renders them very reasonably objects of
suspicion. In the present state of our acquaintance with the reputed
portions of the Skanda Puráńa, my own views of their authenticity are so
opposed to those entertained by Col. Vans Kennedy, that instead of
admitting all the Sanhitás and Khańd́as to be genuine, I doubt if any one
of them was ever a part of the Skanda Puráńa.
