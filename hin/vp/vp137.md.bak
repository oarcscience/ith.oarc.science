### CHAP. XX.

Krishńa and Balaráma meet Kubjá; she is made straight by the former:
they proceed to the palace. Krishńa breaks a bow intended for a trial of
arms. Kansa's orders to his servants. Public games. Krishńa and his
brother enter the arena: the former wrestles with Cháńúra, the latter
with Musht́ika, the king's wrestlers; who are both killed. Krishńa
attacks and slays Kansa: he and Balaráma do homage to Vasudeva and
Devakí: the former praises Krishńa.

As they proceeded along the high road, they saw coming towards them a
young girl, who was crooked, carrying a pot of unguent. Krishńa
addressed her sportively, and said, "For whom are you carrying that
unguent? tell me, lovely maiden; tell me truly." Spoken to as it were
through affection, Kubjá, well disposed towards Hari, replied to him
also mirthfully, being smitten by his appearance; "Know you not,
beloved, that I am the servant of Kansa, and appointed, crooked as I am,
to prepare his perfumes. Unguent ground by any other he does not approve
of: hence I am enriched through his liberal rewards." Then said Krishńa,
"Fair-faced damsel, give us of this unguent, fragrant and fit for kings,
as much as we may rub upon our bodies." "Take it," answered Kubjá.; and
she gave them as much of the unguent as was sufficient for their
persons; and they rubbed it on various parts of their faces and
bodies <span id="fr_1511"></span>[1](#fn_1511.md), till they looked like
two clouds, one white and one black, decorated by the many-tinted bow of
Indra. Then Krishńa, skilled in the curative art, took hold of her,
under the chin, with the thumb and two fingers, and lifted up her head,
whilst with his feet he pressed down her feet; and in this way he made
her straight. When she was thus relieved from her deformity, she was a
most beautiful woman; and, filled with gratitude and affection, she took
Govinda by the garment, and invited him to her house. Promising to come
at some

<span id="page_551">p. 551</span>

other time, Krishńa smilingly dismissed her, and then laughed aloud on
beholding the countenance of Baladeva <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[2](#fn_1512.md).

Dressed in blue and yellow garments, and anointed with fragrant
unguents, Keśava and Ráma proceeded to the hall of arms, which was hung
round with garlands. Inquiring of the warders which bow he was to try,
and being directed to it, he took it, and bent it; but drawing it with
violence, he snapped it in two <span id="fr_1513"></span>[3](#fn_1513.md),
and all Mathurá resounded with the noise which its fracture occasioned.
Abused by the warders for breaking the bow, Krishńa and Ráma retorted,
and defied them, and left the hall.

When Kansa knew that Akrúra had returned, and heard that the bow had
been broken, he thus said to Cháńúra and Musht́ika, his boxers: "Two
youths, cowherd boys, have arrived; you must kill them both, in a trial
of strength, in my presence; for they practise against my life. I shall
be well pleased if you kill them in the match, and will give you
whatever you wish; not else. These two foes of mine must be killed by
you fairly or unfairly. The kingdom shall be ours in common, when they
have perished." Having given them these orders, he sent next for his
elephant driver, and desired him to station his great elephant
Kuvalayápíd́a, who was as vast as a cloud charged with rain, near the
gate of the arena, and drive him upon the two boys when they should
attempt to enter. When Kansa had issued these commands, and ascertained
that the platforms were all ready for the spectators, he awaited the
rising of the sun, unconscious of impending death.

In the morning the citizens assembled on the platforms set apart for
them, and the princes, with the ministers and courtiers, occupied the
royal seats. Near the centre of the circle judges of the games were
stationed by Kansa, whilst he himself sat apart close by upon a lofty
throne. Separate platforms were erected for the ladies of the palace,
for the courtesans, and for the wives of the citizens <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[4](#fn_1514.md). Nanda and the

<span id="page_552">p. 552</span>

cowherds had places appropriated to them, at the end of which sat Akrúra
and Vasudeva. Amongst the wives of the citizens appeared

<span id="page_553">p. 553</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Devakí, mourning
for her son, whose lovely face she longed to behold even in the hour of
his destruction. When the musical instruments

<span id="page_554">p. 554</span>

sounded, Cháńúra sprang forth, and the people cried, "Alas!" and
Musht́ika slapped his arms in defiance. Covered with must and blood

<span id="page_555">p. 555</span>

from the elephant, whom, when goaded upon them by his driver, they had
slain, and armed with his tusks, Balabhadra and Janárddana confidently
entered the arena, like two lions amidst a herd of deer. Exclamations of
pity arose from all the spectators, along with expressions of
astonishment. "This then," said the people, "is Krishńa! this is
Balabhadra! This is he by whom the fierce night-walker Pútaná was slain;
by whom the waggon was overturned, and the two Arjuna trees

<span id="page_556">p. 556</span>

felled! This is the boy who trampled and danced on the serpent Kálíya;
who upheld the mountain Govarddhana for seven nights; who killed, as if
in play, the iniquitous Arisht́a, Dhenuka, and Keśin! This whom we see is
Achyuta! This is he who has been foretold by the wise, skilled in the
sense of the Puráńas, as Gopála, who shall exalt the depressed Yádava
race! This is a portion of the all-existing, all-generating Vishńu,
descended upon earth, who will assuredly lighten her load!" Thus did the
citizens describe Ráma and Krishńa, as soon as they appeared; whilst the
breast of Devakí glowed with maternal affection; and Vasudeva,
forgetting his infirmities, felt himself young again, on beholding the
countenances of his sons as a season of rejoicing. The women of the
palace, and the wives of the citizens, wide opened their eyes, and gazed
intently upon Krishńa. "Look, friends," said they to their companions;
"look at the face of Krishńa; his eyes are reddened by his conflict with
the elephant, and the drops of perspiration stand upon his cheeks,
outvieing a full blown lotus in autumn, studded with glittering dew.
Avail yourself now of the faculty of vision. Observe his breast, the
seat of splendour, marked with the mystic sign; and his arms, menacing
destruction to his foes. Do you not notice Balabhadra, dressed in a blue
garment; his countenance as fair as the jasmine, as the moon, as the
fibres of the lotus stem? See how he gently smiles at the gestures of
Musht́ika and Cháńúra, as they spring up. And now behold Hari advance to
encounter Cháńúra. What! are there no elders, judges of the field? How
can the delicate form of Hari, only yet in the dawn of adolescence, be
regarded as a match for the vast and adamantine bulk of the great demon?
Two youths, of light and elegant persons, are in the arena, to oppose
athletic fiends, headed by the cruel Cháńúra. This is a great sin in the
judges of the games, for the umpires to suffer a contest between boys
and strong men."

As thus the women of the city conversed with one another, Hari, having
tightened his girdle, danced in the ring, shaking the ground on which he
trod. Balabhadra also danced, slapping his arms in defiance. Where the
ground was firm, the invincible Krishńa contended foot to foot with
Cháńúra. The practised demon Musht́ika was opposed by

<span id="page_557">p. 557</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Balabhadra.
Mutually entwining, and pushing, and pulling, and beating each other
with fists, arms, and elbows, pressing each other with their knees,
interlacing their arms, kicking with their feet, pressing with their
whole weight upon one another <span id="fr_1515"></span>[5](#fn_1515.md),
fought Hari and Cháńúra. Desperate was the struggle, though without
weapons, and one for life and death, to the great gratification of the
spectators. In proportion as the contest continued, so Cháńúra was
gradually losing something of his original vigour, and the wreath upon
his head trembled from his fury and distress <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[6](#fn_1516.md); whilst the world-comprehending
Krishńa wrestled with him as if but in sport. Beholding Cháńúra losing,
and Krishńa gaining strength, Kansa, furious with rage, commanded the
music to cease. As soon as the drums and trumpets were silenced, a
numerous band of heavenly instruments was heard in the sky, and the gods
invisibly exclaimed, "Victory to Govinda! Keśava, kill the demon
Cháńúra!" Madhusúdana having for a long time dallied with his adversary,
at last lifted him up, and whirled him round, with the intention of
putting an end to him. Having whirled Cháńúra round a hundred times,
until his breath was expended in the air, Krishńa dashed him on the
ground with such violence as to smash his body into a hundred fragments,
and strew the earth with a hundred pools of gory mire. Whilst this took
place, the mighty Baladeva was engaged in the same manner with the demon
bruiser Musht́ika. Striking him on the head with his fists, and on the

<span id="page_558">p. 558</span>

breast with his knees, he stretched him on the ground, and pummelled him
there till he was dead. Again, Krishńa encountered the royal bruiser
Tomalaka, and felled him to the earth with a blow of his left hand. When
the other athletæ saw Cháńúra, Musht́ika, and Tomalaka killed, they fled
from the field; and Krishńa and Sankarshańa danced victorious on the
arena, dragging along with them by force the cowherds of their own age.
Kansa, his eyes reddening with wrath, called aloud to the surrounding
people, "Drive those two cow-boys out of the assembly: seize the villain
Nanda, and secure him with chains of iron: put Vasudeva to death with
tortures intolerable to his years: and lay hands upon the cattle, and
whatever else belongs to those cowherds who are the associates of
Krishńa."

Upon hearing these orders, the destroyer of Madhu laughed at Kansa, and,
springing up to the place where he was seated, laid hold of him by the
hair of his head, and struck his tiara to the ground: then casting him
down upon the earth, Govinda threw himself upon him. Crushed by the
weight of the upholder of the universe, the son of Ugrasena, Kansa the
king, gave up the ghost. Krishńa then dragged the dead body, by the hair
of the head, into the centre of the arena, and a deep furrow was made by
the vast and heavy carcass of Kansa, when it was dragged along the
ground by Krishńa, as if a torrent of water had run through it <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[7](#fn_1517.md). Seeing Kansa thus treated, his
brother Sumálin came to his succour; but he was encountered, and easily
killed, by Balabhadra. Then arose a general cry of grief from the
surrounding circle, as they beheld the king of Mathurá thus slain, and
treated with such contumely, by Krishńa. Krishńa, accompanied by
Balabhadra, embraced the feet of Vasudeva and of Devakí; but Vasudeva
raised him up; and he and Devakí recalling to recollection what he had
said to them at his birth, they bowed to Janárddana, and the former thus
addressed him: "Have compassion upon mortals, O god, benefactor and lord
of deities: it is by thy favour to us two that thou hast become the
(present) upholder of the

<span id="page_559">p. 559</span>

world. That, for the punishment of the rebellious, thou hast descended
upon earth in my house, having been propitiated by my prayers,
sanctifies our race. Thou art the heart of all creatures; thou abidest
in all creatures; and all that has been, or will be, emanates from thee,
O universal spirit! Thou, Achyuta, who comprehendest all the gods, art
eternally worshipped with sacrifices: thou art sacrifice itself, and the
offerer of sacrifices. The affection that inspires my heart and the
heart of Devakí towards thee, as if thou wast our child, is indeed but
error, and a great delusion. How shall the tongue of a mortal such as I
am call the creator of all things, who is without beginning or end, son?
Is it consistent that the lord of the world, from whom the world
proceeds, should be born of me, except through illusion? How should he,
in whom all fixed and moveable things are contained, be conceived in the
womb and born of a mortal being? Have compassion therefore indeed, O
supreme lord, and in thy descended portions protect the universe. Thou
art no son of mine. This whole world, from Brahmá to a tree, thou art.
Wherefore dost thou, who art one with the supreme, beguile us? Blinded
by delusion, I thought thee my son; and for thee, who art beyond all
fear, I dreaded the anger of Kansa, and therefore did I take thee in my
terror to Gokula, where thou hast grown up; but I no longer claim thee
as mine own. Thou, Vishńu, the sovereign lord of all, whose actions
Rudra, the Maruts, the Aświns, Indra, and the gods, cannot equal,
although they behold them; thou who hast come amongst us for the benefit
of the world, art recognised, and delusion is no more."

<span id="fn_1511"></span>[550:1](vp137.htm#fr_1511.md) They had their
bodies smeared in the style called Bhaktichheda; that is, with the
separating or distinguishing (chheda) marks of Vaishńava devotion
(bhakti): certain streaks on the forehead, nose, cheeks, breast, and
arms, which denote a follower of Vishńu. See As. Res. XVI. 33.

<span id="fn_1512"></span>[551:2](vp137.htm#fr_1512.md) The story is
similarly told in the Bhágavata, &c.

<span id="fn_1513"></span>[551:3](vp137.htm#fr_1513.md) The bending or
breaking of a bow is a favourite incident in Hindu heroic poetry,
borrowed, no doubt, from the Rámáyańa, where, however, it has an object;
here it is quite gratuitous.

<span id="fn_1514"></span>[551:4](vp137.htm#fr_1514.md) The Bhágavata
enters into even fewer <span id="page_552">p. 552</span> particulars
than our text of the place set apart for the games. The Hari Vanśa gives
a much more detailed description, which is in some respects curious. The
want of any technical glossary, and the general manner in which
technical terms are explained in the ordinary dictionaries, render it
difficult to understand exactly what is intended, and any translation of
the passages must be defective. The French version, however, probably
represents a much more splendid and theatrical scene than the text
authorizes, and may therefore admit of correction. The general plan is
nothing more than an enclosed space, surrounded by temporary structures
of timber or bambus, open or enclosed, and decorated with hangings and
garlands. It may be doubted if the details described by the compiler of
the Hari Vanśa were very familiar even to him; for his description is
not always very consistent or precise. Of two commentators, one
evidently knows nothing of what he attempts to explain; but with the
assistance of the other the passages may be thus, though not always
confidently, rendered:--

"The king, Kansa, meditating on these things, went forth from his palace
to the place which had been prepared for the sight of the ceremonial
(1), to inspect the scaffolds (2) which had been constructed. He found
the place close set with the several platforms (3) of the different
public bodies (4), strongly put together, and decorated with roofed
pavilions of various sizes, supported by columns, and divided into
commodious chambers (5). The edifice was extensive, well arranged,
secured by strong rafters (6), spacious and lofty, and commodious and
secure. Stairs led to the different galleries (7). Chairs of state (8)
were placed in various parts of it. The avenues that conducted to it
were narrow (9). It was covered with temporary stages and sheds (10),
and was capable of sustaining the weight of a multitude.

"Having seen the place of the festival thus adorned, Kansa gave orders,
and said, 'To-morrow let the platforms and terraces and pavilions (11)
be decorated with pictures and garlands and flags and images (12), and
let them be scented with fragrant odours, and covered over with awnings
(13). Let there be ample heaps of dry, pounded cow-dung (14) provided on
the ground, and suitable refreshment chambers be covered over, and
decorated with bells and ornamented arches (15). Let large water jars be
securely fixed in order, capable of holding a copious supply, and
provided with golden drinking-cups. Let apartments be prepared (16), and
various kinds of beverage, in appropriate vessels, be ready. Let judges
of the games be invited, and corporations with their chiefs. Let orders
be issued to the wrestlers, and notice be given to the spectators; and
let platforms for their accommodation be fitted up in the place of
assembly.'" (17)

When the meeting takes place, the site of the games is thus described:
"Upon the following day the amphitheatre (18) was filled by the
citizens, anxious to behold the games. The place of
[assembly](errata.htm#22) (19.md) was supported by octagonal painted
pillars (20), <span id="page_553">p. 553</span> fitted up with terraces
and doors and bolts, with windows circular or crescent; shaped, and
accommodated with seats with cushions (21), and it shone like the ocean
whilst large clouds hang upon it, with spacious, substantial pavilions
(22), fitted up for the sight of the combat; open to the front (23), but
screened with beautiful and fine curtains (24), crowned with festoons of
flowers, and glistening with radiance like autumnal clouds. The
pavilions of the different companies and corporations, vast as
mountains, were decorated with banners, bearing upon them the implements
and emblems of the several crafts (25). The chambers of the inhabitants
of the inner apartments shone near at hand, bright with gold and
painting and net-work of gems: they were richly decorated with precious
stones, were enclosed below with costly hangings, and ornamented above
with spires and banners, and looked like mountains spreading their wings
in the sky; while the rays of light reflected from the valuable jewels
were blended with the waving of white chowries, and the musical tinkling
of female ornaments. The separate pavilions of the courtesans were
graced by lovely women, attired in the most splendid dresses (27), and
emulated the radiance of the cars of the gods. In the place of assembly
there were excellent seats, couches made of gold, and hangings of
various colours, intermixed with bunches of flowers: and there were
golden vases of water, and handsome places for refreshment, filled with
fruits of various kinds, and cooling juices, and sherbets fit for
drinking (28). And there were many other stages and platforms,
constructed of strong timber, and hangings by hundreds and thousands
were displayed: and upon the tops of the houses, chambers fitted up with
delicate jalousies, through which the women might behold the sports,
appeared like swans flying through the air.

"In front stood the pavilion of Kansa, surpassing all the rest in
splendour, looking like mount Meru in radiance; its sides, its columns,
being covered with burnished gold; fastened with coloured cords; and
every way worthy the presence of a king."

In justification of the rendering of the above, an explanation of the
technical terms, taken either from dictionaries or from the
commentators, may be subjoined. (1) Kansa went to the Prekshágára,
literally 'house of seeing;' but it is evident, from its interior being
visible to spectators on the tops of the houses, as subsequently
mentioned, that it was not a theatre, or covered edifice. If a building
at all, it was merely a sort of stockade. One commentator calls it, 'a
place made for seeing the sacrifice;' (2) Manchánám avalokaka. The
Manchá is commonly understood to signify a raised platform, with a floor
and a roof, ascended by a ladder: see Dictionary. (3) Mancha-vát́a. Vát́a
is either 'site' or 'inclosure,' and is used here without much affecting
the sense of Mancha. The compound is explained by the commentators,
'prepared places', or 'the sites of the platforms'. (4) The Śreńíś,
associations <span id="page_554">p. 554</span> of artificers practising
the same art. One of the commentaries understands the term to be here
used to denote, not their station, but their labours: 'The structure was
the work of the artificers.' (5) Several words occur here of technical
import. The passage is, \#\#\#. Valabhi is said by the commentator to
mean a structure with a pent roof, supported by six columns. Kut́í, a
circular one, having seven roofs--something perhaps like a Chinese
pagoda--and four columns. The Eka-stambha is a chamber, supported by one
column. (6) Sáraniryyúham. It is difficult to understand the necessity
of rafters in an inclosure in which the platforms and stages seem to
have been erected independently of any floor or wall: but the commentary
explains Niryyúha, 'strong brackets, projecting from a house:' (7)
Aslisht́a sushsht́a manchárohanam. The first epithet is explained, 'not
contracted'; the second, 'well constructed'; and for the 'ascending'
(Árohanam) we have 'where was a line of steps' or 'ladders' There is
another reading of the text, however, which may be rendered, 'Having
steps well secured in their ascent above'. (8) 'Seats for kings'. (9)
Such is the literal purport of Sanchára-patha-sankulam; implying,
possibly, the formation of passages by fences on either side. (10) This
is doubtful: the phrase is Chhannam-tad-vedikábhi. Chhannam means,
literally, 'covered,' and can scarcely be used in the sense of
'overspread or filled with.' Vediká means an elevated floor or terrace,
with which a hall or edifice cannot well be 'covered;' and therefore
requires the sense here given to Chhanna. The commentators are silent.
(11) The Manchavát́as and Valabhis, as above: the other term is Víthi, 'a
shop,' 'a stall,' 'a terrace,' 'a road.' (12) Let them be Vapushmanta;
'having painted or sculptured figures'. The other commentary renders it
merely 'pleasant' or 'agreeable'. (13) 'Covered above with cloths'. The
use of the awning or Semiana is very common in India. (14) For the
wrestlers to rub over their bodies to absorb the perspiration (15) This
is all rather questionable: the passage is most usually, \#\#\#. Vali or
Bali in one sense means 'the edge of a thatch,' and may be put for some
sort of temporary structure, a kind of retiring or refreshment room for
the boxers and wrestlers. In some copies it is read, 'beautiful with
cloths spread,' on which the performers may sit when disengaged; perhaps
a sort of carpet on the ground. (16) The expression is again Vali.
Another sense of the word is, offering of viands, or of the remains of a
sacrifice, to all beings; but that cannot be its purport here; nor is it
ever used in the sense of viands in general. The verb Kalpa or Klrip
also usually <span id="page_555">p. 555</span> implies 'making.' (17)
Manchavát́a; 'in the Samája,' or 'assembly.' (18) Maháranga, 'the great
place of the performance.' Ranga is 'acting' or 'representation;' also
the place or site of it. (19) All the copies consulted, except one,
offer an irregularity of construction, which, although defended by the
commentators, is a license scarcely allowable. The epithets of the first
verse are all in the plural number; they then occur in the singular, to
agree with the only substantive in the description, Samájavát́a.
According to the commentaries, the plural term Manchás understood is the
substantive to the epithets of the first stanza, and Samájavát́a the
singular to those of the other verses. This awkwardness is however
avoided by the reading of an old and very good copy, which puts it all
in the singular; as \#\#\# (20) The expression is Charańa, literally
'foot;' explained by the commentator, Stambha, 'post' or 'pillar' (21)
The reading of most of the copies is Śayanottama, which may be taken as
the sense of Talottama, 'couches or benches with cushions.' (22)
Manchágárais, 'temporary houses.' (21) Or 'fronting to the east'. (24)
Nirmuktais: explained by the commentator to mean 'fine threads,'
'network,' or 'gauze,' through which persons, females especially, may
see without being seen. (25) \#\#\# (26) 'With ridges and projections'.
The commentator explains this, 'with flags on the top of them.' (27)
This appears to be intended for an epithet of the women, although
Ástarańa is not usually applied to dress. (28) Phala, of course, is
'fruit.' Avadanśa is explained in lexicons, what is eaten to excite
thirst:' one comment gives it, what may be sucked,' as tamarinds, and
the like. Chángeri is explained, 'fluids for drinking, made with sorrel,
or acid fruits;' that is, sherbets. (29) \#\#\# is an epithet of the
Prekshágára, or look-out house of the women, situated on the tops of
their houses, according to the commentators; an arrangement very
compatible with the form of Indian houses, which have flat roofs,
commonly enclosed by a trellis work, or jalousie of masonry. It is
observable, that in the Vishńu Puráńa, and in the Mahábhárata, on
various public occasions, the women take their places on the platforms,
or in the pavilions, without curtains or screens.

<span id="fn_1515"></span>[557:5](vp137.htm#fr_1515.md) The terms here used
are technical, and refer to the established modes of wrestling amongst
Hindu athletæ. 1. Sannipáta is described 'mutual laying hold of.' 2.
Avadúta, 'letting go of the adversary.' g. Kshepańa, 'pulling to, and
casting back.' 4. Musht́inipáta, 'striking with fists.' 5. Kílanipáta,
'striking with the elbow.' 6. Vajranipáta, 'striking with the fore-arm.'
7. Jánunirgháta, 'pressing or striking with the knees.' 8.
Báhuvighat́t́ana, 'interlacing the arms.' 9. Pádoddhúta, kicking.' 10.
Prasrisht́á, 'intertwining of the whole body.' In some copies another
term occurs, Aśmanirgháta, 'striking with stones,' or 'striking blows as
hard as with stones;' for stones could scarcely be used in a contest
specified as 'one without weapons'

<span id="fn_1516"></span>[557:6](vp137.htm#fr_1516.md) Krishńa contended
with Cháńúra, 'who through distress and anger shook the flowers of his
crest;' The two last terms are explained, the flower of the wreath on
his head.'

<span id="fn_1517"></span>[558:7](vp137.htm#fr_1517.md) Et latus mediam
sulcus diducit arenam.

'The yielding sand being furrowed into a ditch or a water-course, by the
dead bodies being dragged over it. The text is, \#\#\#.
