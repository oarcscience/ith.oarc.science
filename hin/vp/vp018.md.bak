*The Vishnu Purana*, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson, \[1840\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

14\. The Vámana Puráńa

14\. Vámana Puráńa. "That in which the four-faced Brahmá taught the
three objects of existence, as subservient to the account of the
greatness of Trivikrama, which treats also of the Śiva Kalpa, and which
consists of ten thousand stanzas, is called the Vámana Puráńa <span
id="fr_73"></span>[74](#fn_73.md)."

The Vámana Puráńa contains an account of the dwarf incarnation of
Vishńu; but it is related by Pulastya to Nárada, and extends to but
about seven thousand stanzas. Its contents can scarcely establish its
claim to the character of a Puráńa <span id="fr_74"></span>[75](#fn_74.md).

<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span>

There is little or no order in the subjects which this work
recapitulates, and which arise out of replies made by Pulastya to
questions put abruptly and unconnectedly by Nárada. The greater part of
them relate to the worship of the Linga; a rather strange topic for a
Vaishńava Puráńa, but engrossing the principal part of the compilation.
They are however subservient to the object of illustrating the sanctity
of certain holy places; so that the Vámana Puráńa is little else than a
succession of Máhátmyas. Thus in the opening almost of the work occurs
the story of Daksha's sacrifice, the object of which is to send Śiva to
Pápamochana tírtha at Benares, where he is released from the sin of
Brahmanicide. Next conies the story of the burning of Kámadeva, for the
purpose of illustrating the holiness of a Śiva-linga at Kedareśwara in
the Himalaya, and of Badarikáśrama. The larger part of the work consists
of the Saro-máhátmya, or legendary exemplifications of the holiness of
Stháńu tírtha; that is, of the sanctity of various Lingas and certain
pools at Thanesar and Kurukhet, the country north-west from Delhi. There
are some stories also relating to the holiness of the Gódavarí river;
but the general site of the legends is in Hindustan. In the course of
these accounts we have a long narrative of the marriage of Śiva with
Umá, and the birth of Kártikeya. There are a few brief allusions to
creation and the Manwantaras, but they are merely incidental; and all
the five characteristics of a Puráńa are deficient. In noticing the
Swárochisha Manwantara, towards the end of the book, the elevation of
Bali as monarch of the Daityas, and his subjugation of the universe, the
gods included, are described; and this leads to the narration that gives
its title to the Puráńa, the birth of Krishńa as a dwarf, for the
purpose of humiliating Bali by fraud, as he was invincible by force. The
story is told as usual, but the scene is laid at Kurukshetra.

A more minute examination of this work than that which has been given to
it might perhaps discover some hint from which to conjecture its date.
It is of a more tolerant character than the Puráńas, and divides its
homage between Śiva and Vishńu with tolerable impartiality. It is not
connected, therefore, with any sectarial principles, and may have
preceded their introduction. It has not, however, the air of any
antiquity,

<span id="page_xlix">p. xlix</span>

and its compilation may have amused the leisure of some Brahman of
Benares three or four centuries ago.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[xlvii:75](vp018.htm#fr_74.md) From the extracts
from the Vámana Pura translated by Col. Vans Kennedy, p. 293 et seq., it
appears that his copy so far corresponds with mine, and the work is
therefore probably the same: two copies in the Company's library also
agree with mine.
