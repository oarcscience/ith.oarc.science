Classification of the Puráńas

There is another classification of the Puráńas alluded to in the Matsya
Puráńa, and specified by the Padma Puráńa, but more fully. It is not
undeserving of notice, as it expresses the opinion which native writers
entertain of the scope of the Puráńas, and of their recognising the
subservience of these works to the dissemination of sectarian
principles.. Thus it is said in the Uttara Khańd́a of the Padma, that the
Puráńas, as well as other works, are divided into three classes,
according to the qualities which prevail in them. Thus the Vishńu,
Náradíya, Bhágavata, Gárud́a, Padma, and Váráha Puráńas, are Sátwika, or
pure, from the predominance in them of the Satwa quality, or that of
goodness and purity. They are, in fact, Vaishńava Puráńas. The Matsya,
Kúrma, Linga, Śiva, Skanda, and Agni Puráńas, are Támasa, or Puráńas of
darkness, from the prevalence of the quality of Tamas, 'ignorance,'
'gloom.' They are indisputably Śaiva Puráńas. The third series,
comprising the Brahmáńd́a, Brahma-vaivartta, Márkańd́eya, Bhavishya,
Vámana, and Brahmá Puráńas, are designated as Rájasa, 'passionate,' from
Rajas, the property of passion, which they are supposed to represent..
The Matsya does not specify which are the Puráńas that come under these
designations, but remarks that those in which the Máhátmya of Hari or
Vishńu prevails are Sátwika; those in which the legends of Agni or Śiva
predominate are Támasa; and those which dwell most on the stories of
Brahmá are Rájasa. I have elsewhere stated <span
id="fr_24"></span>[25](#fn_24.md), that I considered the Rájasa Puráńas to
lean to the Sákta division of the Hindus, the worshippers of Śakti, or
the female principle; founding this opinion

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

on the character of the legends which some of them contain, such as the
Durgá Máhátmya, or celebrated legend on which the worship of Durgá or
Kálí is especially founded, which is a principal episode of the
Márkańd́eya. The Brahma-vaivartta also devotes the greatest portion of
its chapters to the celebration of Rádhá, the mistress of Krishńa, and
other female divinities. Col. Vans Kennedy, however, objects to the
application of the term Sákta to this last division of the Puráńas, the
worship of Śakti being the especial object of a different class of
works, the Tantras, and no such form of worship being particularly
inculcated in the Bráhma Puráńa <span id="fr_25"></span>[26](#fn_25.md).
This last argument is of weight in regard to the particular instance
specified, and the designation of Śakti may not be correctly applicable
to the whole class, although it is to some of the series; for there is
no incompatibility in the advocacy of a Tántrika modification of the
Hindu religion by any Puráńa, and it has unquestionably been practised
in works known as Upa-puráńas. The proper appropriation of the third
class of the Puráńas, according to the Padma Puráńa, appears to be to
the worship of Krishńa, not in the character in which he is represented
in the Vishńu and Bhágavata Puráńas, in which the incidents of his
boyhood are only a portion of his biography, and in which the human
character largely participates, at least in his riper years, but as the
infant Krishńa, Govinda, Bála Gopála, the sojourner in Vrindávan, the
companion of the cowherds and milkmaids, the lover of Rádhá, or as the
juvenile master of the universe, Jagannátha. The term Rájasa, implying
the animation of passion, and enjoyment of sensual delights, is
applicable, not only to the character of the youthful divinity, but to
those with whom his adoration in these forms seems to have originated,
the Gosains of Gokul and Bengal, the followers and descendants of
Vallabha and Chaitanya, the priests and proprietors of Jagannáth and
Śrínáth-dwár, who lead a life of affluence and indulgence, and
vindicate, both by precept and practice, the reasonableness of the
Rájasa property, and the congruity of temporal enjoyment with the duties
of religion <span id="fr_26"></span>[27](#fn_26.md).

The Puráńas are uniformly stated to be eighteen in number. It is said
that there are also eighteen Upa-puráńas, or minor Puráńas; but

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

the names of only a few of these are specified in the least
exceptionable authorities, and the greater number of the works is not
procurable. With regard to the eighteen Puráńas, there is a peculiarity
in their specification, which is proof of an interference with the
integrity of the text, in some of them at least; for each of them
specifies the names of the whole eighteen. Now the list could not have
been complete whilst the work that gives it was unfinished, and in one
only therefore, the last of the series, have we a right to look for it.
As however there are more last words than one, it is evident that the
names must have been inserted in all except one after the whole were
completed: which of the eighteen is the exception, and truly the last,
there is no clue to discover, and the specification is probably an
interpolation in most, if not in all.

The names that are specified are commonly the same, and are as follows:
1. Bráhma, 2. Pádma, 3. Vaishńava, 4. Śaiva, 5. Bhágavata, 6. Nárada, 7.
Márkańd́a, 8. Ágneya, 9. Bhavishya, 10. Brahma-vaivartta, 11. Lainga, 12.
Váráha, 13. Skánda, 14. Vámana, 15. Kaurma, 16. Mátsya, 17. Gárud́a, 18.
Brahmáńd́a <span id="fr_27"></span>[28](#fn_27.md). This is from the twelfth
book of the Bhágavata, and is the same as occurs in the Vishńu <span
id="fr_28"></span>[29](#fn_28.md). In other authorities there are a few
variations. The list of the K.úrma P. omits the Agni Puráńa, and
substitutes the Váyu. The Agni leaves out the Śaiva, and inserts the
Váyu. The Varáha omits the Gárud́a and Brahmáńd́a, and inserts the Váyu
and Narasinha: in this last it is singular. The Márkańd́eya agrees with
the Vishńu and Bhágavata in omitting the Váyu. The Matsya, like the
Agni, leaves out the Śaiva.

Some of the Puráńas, as the Agni, Matsya, Bhágavata, and Padma, also
particularize the number of stanzas which each of the eighteen contains.
In one or two instances they disagree, but in general they concur. The
aggregate is stated at 400,000 slokas, or 1,600,000 lines. These are

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

fabled to be but an abridgment, the whole amount being a krore, or ten
millions of stanzas, or even a thousand millions. If all the fragmentary
portions claiming in various parts of India to belong to the Puráńas
were admitted, their extent would much exceed the lesser, though it
would not reach the larger enumeration. The former is, however, as I
have elsewhere stated <span id="fr_29"></span>[30](#fn_29.md), a quantity
that an individual European scholar could scarcely expect to peruse with
due care and attention, unless his whole time were devoted exclusively
for many years to the task. Yet without some such labour being achieved,
it was clear, from the crudity and inexactness of all that had been
hitherto published on the subject, with one exception <span
id="fr_30"></span>[31](#fn_30.md), that sound views on the subject of Hindu
mythology and tradition were not to be expected. Circumstances, which I
have already explained in the paper in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic
Society referred to above, enabled me to avail myself of competent
assistance, by which I made a minute abstract of most of the Puráńas. In
course of time I hope to place a tolerably copious and connected
analysis of the whole eighteen before Oriental scholars, and in the mean
while offer a brief notice of their several contents.

In general the enumeration of the Puráńas is a simple nomenclature, with
the addition in some cases of the number of verses; but to these the
Matsya Puráńa joins the mention of one or two circumstances peculiar to
each, which, although scanty, are of value, as offering means of
identifying the copies of the Puráńas now found with those to which the
Matsya refers, or of discovering a difference between the present and
the past. I shall therefore prefix the passage descriptive of each
Puráńa from the Matsya. It is necessary to remark, however, that in the
comparison instituted between that description and the Puráńa as it
exists, I necessarily refer to the copy or copies which I employed for
the purpose of examination and analysis, and which were procured with
some trouble and cost in Benares and Calcutta. In some instances my
manuscripts

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

have been collated with others from different parts of India, and the
result has shewn, that, with regard at least to the Brahmá, Vishńu,
Váyu, Matsya, Padma, Bhágavata, and Kúrma Puráńas, the same works, in
all essential respects, are generally current under the same
appellations. Whether this is invariably the case may be doubted, and
farther inquiry may possibly shew that I have been obliged to content
myself with mutilated or unauthentic works <span
id="fr_31"></span>[32](#fn_31.md). It is with this reservation, therefore,
that I must be understood to speak of the concurrence or disagreement of
any Puráńa with the notice of it which the Matsya P. has preserved.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[xiv:28](vp004.htm#fr_27.md) The names are put
attributively, the noun substantive, Puráńa, being understood. Thus
Vaishńavam Puráńam means the Puráńa of Vishńu; Śaivam Puráńam, the P. of
Śiva; Bráhmam Puráńam, the P. of Brahmá. It is equally correct, and more
common, to use the two substantives <span id="page_xv">p. xv</span> in
apposition, as Vishńu Puráńa, Śiva Puráńa, &c. In the original Sanscrit
the nouns are compounded, as Vishńu-puráńam, &c.; but it has not been
customary to combine them in their European shape.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[xv:31](vp004.htm#fr_30.md) I allude to the
valuable work of Col. Vans Kennedy, on the Affinity between Ancient and
Hindu Mythology. However much I may differ from that learned and
industrious writer's conclusions, I must do him the justice to admit
that he is the only author who has discussed the subject of the
mythology of the Hindus on right principles, by drawing his materials
from authentic sources.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[xvi:32](vp004.htm#fr_31.md) Upon examining the
translations of different passages from the Puráńas, given by Col. Vans
Kennedy in the work mentioned in a former note, and comparing them with
the text of the manuscripts I have consulted, I find such an agreement
as to warrant the belief that there is no essential difference between
the copies in his possession and in mine. The varieties which occur in
the MSS. of the East India Company's Library will be noticed in the
text.
