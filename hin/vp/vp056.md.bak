### CHAP. XXI.

Families of the Daityas. Descendants of Kaśyapa by Danu. Children of
Kaśyapa by his other wives. Birth of the Márutas, the sons of Diti.

THE sons of Sanhráda, the son of Hirańyakaśipu, were Áyushmán, Śivi, and
Váshkala <span id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_329.md). Prahláda had a son named
Virochana; whose son was Bali, who had a hundred sons, of whom Báńa was
the eldest <span id="fr_330"></span>[2](#fn_330.md).

Hirańyáksha also had many sons, all of whom were Daityas of great
prowess; Jharjhara, Śakuni, Bhútasantápana, Mahánábha, the mighty-armed
and the valiant Táraka. These were the sons of Diti <span
id="fr_331"></span>[3](#fn_331.md).

The children of Kaśyapa by Danu were Dwimúrddhá, Śankara, Ayomukha,
Śankuśiras, Kapila, Samvara, Ekachakra, and another mighty Táraka,
Swarbhánu, Vrishaparvan, Puloman, and the powerful Viprachitti; these
were the renowned Dánavas, or sons of Danu <span
id="fr_332"></span>[4](#fn_332.md).

Swarbhánu had a daughter named Prabhá <span
id="fr_333"></span>[5](#fn_333.md); and Śarmisht́há <span
id="fr_334"></span>[6](#fn_334.md) was the daughter of Vrishaparvan, as
were Upadánaví and Hayaśirá <span id="fr_335"></span>[7](#fn_335.md).

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

Vaiswánara <span id="fr_336"></span>[8](#fn_336.md) had two daughters,
Pulomá and Káliká, who were both married to Kaśyapa, and bore him sixty
thousand distinguished Dánavas, called Paulomas and Kálakanjas <span
id="fr_337"></span>[9](#fn_337.md), who were powerful, ferocious, and
cruel.

The sons of Viprachitti by Sinhiká (the sister of Hirańyakaśipu) were
Vyanśa, Śalya the strong, Nabha the powerful, Vátápi, Namuchi, Ilwala,
Khasrima, Anjaka, Naraka, and Kálanábha, the valiant Swarbhánu, and the
mighty Vaktrayodhí <span id="fr_338"></span>[10](#fn_338.md). These were
the most eminent Dánavas <span id="fr_339"></span>[11](#fn_339.md), through
whom the race of Danu was multiplied by hundreds and thousands through
succeeding generations.

In the family of the Daitya Prahláda, the Niváta Kavachas were born,
whose spirits were purified by rigid austerity <span
id="fr_340"></span>[12](#fn_340.md).

Támrá (the wife of Kaśyapa) had six illustrious daughters, named Śukí,
Śyení, Bhásí, Sugríví, Śuchi, and Gridhriká. Śukí gave birth to parrots,
owls, and crows <span id="fr_341"></span>[13](#fn_341.md); Śyení to hawks;
Bhásí to kites; Gridhriká

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

to vultures; Śuchi to water-fowl; Sugríví to horses, camels, and asses.
Such were the progeny of Támrá.

Vinatá bore to Kaśyapa two celebrated sons, Garud́a and Aruńa: the
former, also called Suparńa, was the king of the feathered tribes, and
the remorseless enemy of the serpent race <span
id="fr_342"></span>[14](#fn_342.md).

The children of Surasá were a thousand mighty many-headed serpents,
traversing the sky <span id="fr_343"></span>[15](#fn_343.md).

The progeny of Kadru were a thousand powerful many-headed serpents, of
immeasurable might, subject to Garud́a; the chief amongst whom were
Śesha, Vásuki, Takshaka, Śankha, Śweta, Mahápadma, Kambala, Áswatara,
Elápatra, Nága, Karkkota, Dhananjaya, and many other fierce and venomous
serpents <span id="fr_344"></span>[16](#fn_344.md).

The family of Krodhavasá were all sharp-toothed monsters <span
id="fr_345"></span>[17](#fn_345.md), whether on the earth, amongst the
birds, or in the waters, that were devourers of flesh.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

 <span id="fr_346"></span>[18](#fn_346.md)Surabhi was the mother of cows
and buffaloes <span id="fr_347"></span>[19](#fn_347.md): Irá, of trees and
creeping plants and shrubs, and every kind of grass: Khasá, of the
Rákshasas and Yakshas <span id="fr_348"></span>[20](#fn_348.md): Muni, of
the Apsarasas <span id="fr_349"></span>[21](#fn_349.md): and Arisht́á, of
the illustrious Gandharbas.

These were the children of Kaśyapa, whether movable or stationary, whose
descendants multiplied infinitely through successive generations <span
id="fr_350"></span>[22](#fn_350.md). This creation, oh Brahman, took place
in the second or Swárochisha Manwantara. In the present or Vaivaswata
Manwantara, Brahmá being engaged at the great sacrifice instituted by
Varuńa, the creation of progeny, as it is called, occurred; for he
begot, as his sons, the seven Rishis, who were formerly mind-engendered;
and was himself the grand-sire of the Gandharbas, serpents, Dánavas, and
gods <span id="fr_351"></span>[23](#fn_351.md).

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

Diti, having lost her children, propitiated Kaśyapa; and the best of
ascetics, being pleased with her, promised her a boon; on which she
prayed for a son of irresistible prowess and valour, who should destroy
Indra. The excellent Muni granted his wife the great gift she had
solicited, but with one condition: "You shall bear a son," he said, "who
shall slay Indra, if with thoughts wholly pious, and person entirely
pure, you carefully carry the babe in your womb for a hundred years."
Having thus said, Kaśyapa departed; and the dame conceived, and during
gestation assiduously observed the rules of mental and personal purity.
When the king of the immortals, learnt that Diti bore a son destined for
his destruction, he came to her, and attended upon her with the utmost
humility, watching for an opportunity to disappoint her intention. At
last, in the last year of the century, the opportunity occurred. Diti

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

retired one night to rest without performing the prescribed ablution of
her feet, and fell asleep; on which the thunderer divided with his
thunderbolt the embryo in her womb into seven portions. The child, thus
mutilated, cried bitterly; and Indra repeatedly attempted to console and
silence it, but in vain: on which the god, being incensed, again divided
each of the seven portions into seven, and thus formed the swift-moving
deities called Márutas (winds). They derived this appellation from the
words with which Indra had addressed them (Má rodíh, 'Weep not'); and
they became forty-nine subordinate divinities, the associates of the
wielder of the thunderbolt <span id="fr_352"></span>[24](#fn_352.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_329"></span>[147:1](vp056.htm#fr_329.md) The Padma P. makes
these the sons of Prahláda. The Bhágavata says there were five sons, but
does not give the names. It also inserts the sons of Hláda, making them
the celebrated demons Ilwala and Vátápi. The Váyu refers to Hláda, other
Daityas, famous in Pauráńic legend, making his son, Nisunda; and his
sons, Sunda and Upasunda; the former the father of Marícha and Táraká;
the latter, of Múka.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[147:2](vp056.htm#fr_330.md) The Padma P. and Váyu
name several of these, but they are not of any note: the latter gives
the names of two daughters, who are more celebrated, Pútaná and Śakuni.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[147:3](vp056.htm#fr_331.md) The descendants of
Hirańyáksha are said, in the Padma P., to have extended to seventy-seven
crores, or seven hundred and seventy millions. Some copies, for Táraka,
read Kálanábha.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[147:4](vp056.htm#fr_332.md) The Padma and Váyu P.
furnish a much longer list of names, but those of most note are the same
as in the text, with which also the Bhágavata for the most part agrees.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[147:5](vp056.htm#fr_333.md) The Bhágavata makes
Prabhá the wife of Namuchi: according to the Váyu, she is the mother of
Nahusha.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[147:6](vp056.htm#fr_334.md) Married to Yayáti, as
will be related.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[147:7](vp056.htm#fr_335.md) The text might be
understood to imply that the latter two were the daughters of
Vaiswánara; and the Bhágavata has, "The four lovely daughters of
Vaiswánara were Upadánaví, Hayaśiras, Pulomá, and Kálaká." The Padma
substitutes Vajrá and Sundarí for the two former names. The Váyu
specifies only Pulomá and Káliká as the daughters of Vaiswánara, as does
our text. Upadánaví, according to the Bhágavata, is the wife of
Hirańyáksha; and Hayaśiras, of Kratu.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[148:8](vp056.htm#fr_336.md) Though not specified
by the text as one of the Dánavas, he is included in the catalogue of
the Váyu, and the commentator on the Bhágavata calls him a son of Danu.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[148:9](vp056.htm#fr_337.md) The word is also read
Kúlakas and Kálakeyas: the Mahábhárata, I. 643, has Kálakanjas.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[148:10](vp056.htm#fr_338.md) The text omits the
two most celebrated of the Sainhikeyas, or sons of Sinhiká, Ráhu (see
[p. 78](vp044.htm#page_78). note [8](vp044.htm#fn_236).md) and Ketu, who
are specified both in the Bhágavata and the Váyu; the former as the
eldest son. Of the other sons it is said by the Váyu that they were all
killed by Paraśuráma.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[148:11](vp056.htm#fr_339.md) Two names of note,
found in the Váyu, are omitted by the Vishńu; that of Puloman, the
father of Śachí, the wife of Indra, and mother of Jayanta; and Maya, the
father of Vajrakámá and Mahodarí.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[148:12](vp056.htm#fr_340.md) The Bhágavata says
the Paulomas were killed by Arjuna, who therefore, the commentator
observes, were the same as the Niváta Kavachas: but the Mahábhárata
describes the destruction of the Niváta Kavachas and of the Paulomas and
Kálakeyas as the successive exploits of Arjuna. Vana P. 8. I. 633. The
story is narrated in detail only in the Mahábhárata, which is
consequently prior to all the Puráńas in which the allusion occurs.
According to that work, the Niváta Kavachas were Dánavas, to the number
of thirty millions, residing in the depths of the sea; and the Paulomas
and Kálakanjas were the children of two Daitya dames, Pulomá and Kálaká,
inhabiting Hiranyapura, the golden city, floating in the air.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[148:13](vp056.htm#fr_341.md) All the copies read
\#\#\# which should be, 'Śúkí bore parrots; and Ulúkí, the several sorts
of owls? but Ulúkí is nowhere named as one of the daughters of Támrá;
and the reading may be, 'Owls <span id="page_149">p. 149</span> and
birds opposed to owls, i. e. crows. The authorities generally concur
with our text; but the Váyu has a somewhat different account; or, Śukí,
married to Garud́a, the mother of parrots: Śyení, married to Aruńa,
mother of Sampáti and Jat́áyu: Bhásí, the mother of jays, owls, crows,
peacocks, pigeons, and fowls: Kraunchi, the parent of curlews, herons,
cranes: and Dhritaráshtrí, the mother of geese, ducks, teal, and other
water-fowl. The three last are also called the wives of Garud́a.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[149:14](vp056.htm#fr_342.md) Most of the Puráńas
agree in this account; but the Bhágavata makes Vinatá the wife of
Tárksha, and in this place substitutes Saramá, the mother of wild
animals. The Váyu adds the metres of the Vedas as the daughters of
Vinatá; and the Padma gives her one daughter Saudáminí.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[149:15](vp056.htm#fr_343.md) The dragons of
modern fable. Anáyush or Danáyush is substituted for Surasá in the Váyu,
and in one of the accounts of the Padma. The Bhágavata says Rákshasas
were her offspring. The Matsya has both Surasá and Anáyush, making the
former the parent of all quadrupeds, except cows; the latter, the mother
of diseases.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[149:16](vp056.htm#fr_344.md) The Váyu names
forty: the most noted amongst whom, in addition to those of the text,
are Airávata, Dhritarásht́ra, Mahánila, Baláhaka, Anjana, Pushpadansht́ra,
Durmukha, Kálíya, Puńd́aríka, Kapila, Náhusha, and Mańi.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[149:17](vp056.htm#fr_345.md) By Dansht́rińa some
understand, serpents, some Rákshasas; but by the context carnivorous
animals, birds, and fishes seem intended. The Váyu makes Krodhavaśá the
mother of twelve daughters, Mrigí and others, from whom all wild
animals, deer, elephants, monkeys, tigers, lions, dogs, also fishes,
reptiles, and Bhútas and Piśáchas, or goblins, sprang.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[150:18](vp056.htm#fr_346.md) One copy only
inserts a half stanza here; "Krodhá was the mother of the Piśáchas;"
which is an interpolation apparently from the Matsya or Hari Vanśa. The
Padma P., second legend, makes Krodhá the mother of the Bhútas; and
Piśáchá, of the Piśáchás.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[150:19](vp056.htm#fr_347.md) The Bhágavata says,
of animals with cloven hoofs. The Váyu has, of the eleven Rudras, of the
bull of Śiva, and of two daughters, Rohińí and Gandharbí; from the
former of whom descended horned cattle; and from the latter, horses.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[150:20](vp056.htm#fr_348.md) According to the
Váyu, Khasá had two sons, Yaksha and Rákshas, severally the progenitors
of those beings.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[150:21](vp056.htm#fr_349.md) The Padma, second
series, makes Vách the mother of both Apsarasas and Gandharbas: the Váyu
has long lists of the names of both classes, as well as of Vidyádharas
and Kinnaras. The Apsarasas are distinguished as of two kinds, Laukika,
'worldly,' of whom thirty-four are specified; and Daivika, or 'divine,'
ten in number: the latter furnish the individuals most frequently
engaged in the interruption of the penances of holy sages, such as
Menaká, Sahajanyá, Ghritáchí, Pramlochá, Viswáchi, and Púrvachitti.
Urvaśí is of a different order to both, being the daughter of Náráyańa.
Rambhá, Tilotamá Misrakeśí, are included amongst the Laukika nymphs.
There are also fourteen Gańas, or troops, of Apsarasas, bearing peculiar
designations, as Áhútas, Sobhayantís, Vegavatís, &c.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[150:22](vp056.htm#fr_350.md) The Kúrma, Matsya,
Bráhma, Linga, Agni, Padma, and Váyu Puráńas agree generally with our
text in the description of Kaśyapa's wives and progeny. The Váyu enters
most into details, and contains very long catalogues of the names of the
different characters descended from the sage. The Padma and Matsya and
the Hari Vanśa repeat the story, but admit several variations, some of
which have been adverted to in the preceding notes.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[150:23](vp056.htm#fr_351.md) We have a
considerable variation here in the commentary, and it may be doubted if
the allusion in the text is accurately explained by either of the
versions. In one it is said that 'Brahmá, the grandsire of <span
id="page_151">p. 151</span> the Gandharbas, &c., appointed the seven
Rishis, who were born in a former Manwantara, to be his sons, or to be
the intermediate agents in creation: he created no other beings himself,
being engrossed by the sacrificial ceremony.' Instead of "putratwe," 'in
the state of sons,' the reading is sometimes "pitratwe," 'in the
character of fathers;' that is, to all other beings. Thus the gods and
the rest, who in a former Manwantara originated from Kaśyapa, were
created in the present period as the offspring of the seven Rishis. The
other explanation agrees with the preceding in ascribing the birth of
all creatures to the intermediate agency of the seven Rishis, but calls
them the actual sons of Brahmá, begotten at the sacrifice of Vanilla, in
the sacrificial fire. The authority for the story is not given, beyond
its being in other Puráńas, it has the air of a modern mystification.
The latter member of the passage is separated altogether from the
foregoing, and carried on to what follows: thus; "In the war of the
Gandharbas, serpents, gods, and demons, Diti having lost her children,"
&c.; the word 'virodha' being understood, it is said, This is defended
by the authority of the Hari Vanśa, where the passage occurs word for
word, except in the last half stanza, which, instead of \#\#\# occurs
\#\#\#. The parallel passages are thus rendered by M. Langlois: 'Le
Mouni Swarotchicha avoit cessé de régner quand cette création eut lieu:
c’était sous l’empire du Menou Vevaswata le sacrifice de Varouna avait
commencé. La première création fut celle de Brahmá, quand il jugea qu’il
était temps de procéder à son sacrifice, et que, souverain aïeul du
monde, il forma lui-même dans sa pensée et enfanta les sept
Brahmarchis.'

<span id="fn_352"></span>[152:24](vp056.htm#fr_352.md) This legend occurs
in all those Puráńas in which the account of Kaśyapa's family is
related.
