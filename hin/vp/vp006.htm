<p>2. Padma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. "That which contains an account of the period when the world was a golden lotus (padma), and of all the occurrences of that time, is therefore called the P&aacute;dma by the wise: it contains fifty-five thousand stanzas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A>." The second Pur&aacute;n&#769;a in the usual lists is always the P&aacute;dma, a very voluminous work, containing, according to its own statement, as well as that of other authorities, fifty-five thousand slokas; an amount not far from the truth. These are divided amongst five books, or Khan&#769;d&#769;as; 1. the Srisht&#769;i Khan&#769;d&#769;a, or section on creation; 2. the Bh&uacute;mi Khan&#769;d&#769;a, description of the earth; 3. the Swarga Khan&#769;d&#769;a, chapter on heaven; 4. P&aacute;t&aacute;la Khan&#769;d&#769;a, chapter on the regions below the earth; and 5. the Uttara Khan&#769;d&#769;a, last or supplementary chapter. There is also current a sixth division, the Kriy&aacute; Yoga S&aacute;ra, a treatise on the practice of devotion.</p>  
<p>The denominations of these divisions of the Padma P. convey but an imperfect and partial notion of their contents. In the first, or section which treats of creation, the narrator is Ugra&#347;ravas the S&uacute;ta, the son of Lomaharshan&#769;a, who is sent by his father to the Rishis at Naimish&aacute;r&aacute;n&#769;ya to communicate to them the Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, which, from its containing an account of the lotus (padma), in which Brahm&aacute; appeared at creation, is termed the P&aacute;dma or Padma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. The S&uacute;ta repeats what was originally communicated by Brahm&aacute; to Pulastya, and by him to Bh&iacute;shma. The early chapters narrate the cosmogony, and the genealogy of the patriarchal families, much in the same style, and often in the same words, as the Vishn&#769;u; and short accounts of the Manwantaras and regal dynasties: but these, which are legitimate Paur&aacute;n&#769;ik matters, soon make way for new and unauthentic inventions, illustrative of the virtues of the lake of Pushkara, or Pokher in Ajmir, as a place of pilgrimage.</p>  
<p>The Bh&uacute;mi Khan&#769;d&#769;a, or section of the earth, defers any description of the earth until near its close, filling up one hundred and twenty-seven chapters with legends of a very mixed description, some ancient and common to other Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, but the greater part peculiar to itself, illustrative of T&iacute;rthas either figuratively so termed--as a wife, a parent, or a</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xix"><font size="1" color="green">p. xix</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Guru, considered as a sacred object--or places to which actual pilgrimage should be performed.</p>  
<p>The Swarga Khan&#769;d&#769;a describes in the first chapters the relative positions of the Lokas or spheres above the earth, placing above all Vaikun&#769;tha, the sphere of Vishn&#769;u; an addition which is not warranted by what appears to be the oldest cosmology&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">38</FONT></A>. Miscellaneous notices of some of the most celebrated princes then succeed, conformably to the usual narratives; and these are followed by rules of conduct for the several castes, and at different stages of life. The rest of the book is occupied by legends of a diversified description, introduced without much method or contrivance; a few of which, as Daksha's sacrifice, are of ancient date, but of which the most are original and modern.</p>  
<p>The P&aacute;t&aacute;la Khan&#769;d&#769;a devotes a brief introduction to the description of P&aacute;t&aacute;la, the regions of the snake-gods; but the name of R&aacute;ma having been mentioned, &#346;esha, who has succeeded Pulastya as spokesman, proceeds to narrate the history of R&aacute;ma, his descent and his posterity; in which the compiler seems to have taken the poem of K&aacute;lida&#347;a, the Raghu Van&#347;a, for his chief authority. An originality of addition may be suspected, however, in the adventures of the horse destined by R&aacute;ma for an A&#347;wamedha, which form the subject of a great many chapters. When about to be sacrificed, the horse turns out to be a Brahman, condemned by an imprecation of Durv&aacute;sas, a sage, to assume the equine nature, and who, by having been sanctified by connexion with R&aacute;ma, is released from his metamorphosis, and dispatched as a spirit of light to heaven. This piece of Vaishn&#769;ava fiction is followed by praises of the &#346;r&iacute; Bh&aacute;gavata, an account of Krishn&#769;a's juvenilities, and the merits of worshipping Vishn&#769;u. These accounts are communicated through a machinery borrowed from the Tantras: they are told by Sad&aacute;&#347;iva to P&aacute;rvati, the ordinary interlocutors of T&aacute;ntrika compositions.</p>  
<p>The Uttara Khan&#769;d&#769;a is a most voluminous aggregation of very heterogeneous matters, but it is consistent in adopting a decidedly Vaishn&#769;ava tone, and admitting no compromise with any other form of faith. The chief subjects are first discussed in a dialogue between king Dil&iacute;pa and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xx"><font size="1" color="green">p. xx</font></A></p>  
<p>the Muni Va&#347;isht&#769;ha; such as the merits of bathing in the month of M&aacute;gha, and the potency of the Mantra or prayer addressed to Lakshm&iacute; N&aacute;r&aacute;yan&#769;a. But the nature of Bhakti, faith in Vishn&#769;u--the use of Vaishn&#769;ava marks on the body--the legends of Vishn&#769;u's Avat&aacute;ras, and especially of R&aacute;ma--and the construction of images of Vishn&#769;u--are too important to be left to mortal discretion: they are explained by &#346;iva to P&aacute;rvati, and wound up by the adoration of Vishn&#769;u by those divinities. The dialogue then reverts to the king and the sage; and the latter states why Vishn&#769;u is the only one of the triad entitled to respect; &#346;iva being licentious, Brahm&aacute; arrogant, and Vishn&#769;u alone pure. Va&#347;isht&#769;ha then repeats, after &#346;iva, the M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya of the Bhagavad G&iacute;t&aacute;; the merit of each book of which is illustrated by legends of the good consequences to individuals from perusing or hearing it. Other Vaishn&#769;ava M&aacute;h&aacute;tmyas occupy considerable portions of this Khan&#769;d&#769;a, especially the K&aacute;rt&iacute;ka M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya, or holiness of the month Kartika, illustrated as usual by stories, a few of which are of an early origin, but the greater part modern, and peculiar to this Pur&aacute;n&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The Kriy&aacute; Yoga S&aacute;ra is repeated by S&uacute;ta to the Rishis, after Vy&aacute;sa's communication of it to Jaimini, in answer to an inquiry how religious merit might be secured in the K&aacute;l&iacute; age, in which men have become incapable of the penances and abstraction by which final liberation was formerly to be attained. The answer is, of course, that which is intimated in the last hook of the Vishn&#769;u Pur&aacute;n&#769;a--personal devotion to Vishn&#769;u: thinking of him, repeating his names, wearing his marks, worshipping in his temples, are a full substitute for all other acts of moral or devotional or contemplative merit.</p>  
<p>The different portions of the Padma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a are in all probability as many different works, neither of which approaches to the original definition of a Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. There may be some connexion between the three first portions, at least as to time; but there is no reason to consider them as of high antiquity. They specify the Jains both by name and practices.; they talk of Mlechchhas, 'barbarians,' flourishing in India; they commend</p>

<p>the use of the frontal and other Vaishn&#769;ava marks; and they notice other subjects which, like these, are of no remote origin. The P&aacute;t&aacute;la Khan&#769;d&#769;a dwells copiously upon the Bh&aacute;gavata, and is consequently posterior to it. The Uttara Khan&#769;d&#769;a is intolerantly Vaishn&#769;ava, and is therefore unquestionably modern. It enjoins the veneration of the S&aacute;l&aacute;gram stone and Tulas&iacute; plant, the use of the Tapta-mudra, or stamping with a hot iron the name of Vishn&#769;u on the skin, and a variety of practices and observances undoubtedly no part of the original system. It speaks of the shrines of &#346;r&iacute;-rangam and Venkat&aacute;dri in the Dekhin, temples that have no pretension to remote antiquity; and it names Haripur on the Tungabhadra, which is in all likelihood the city of Vijayanagar, founded in the middle of the fourteenth century. The Kriy&aacute; Yoga S&aacute;ra is equally a modern, and apparently a Bengali composition. No portion of the Padma Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is probably older than the twelfth century, and the last parts may be as recent as the fifteenth or sixteenth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A>.</p>
