### CHAP. V.

Divisions of the Yajur-veda. Story of Yájnawalkya: forced to give up
what he has learned: picked up by others, forming the Taittiríya-yajush.
Yájnawalkya worships the sun, who communicates to him the
Vájasneyí-yajush.

PARÁŚARA.--Of the tree of the Yajur-veda there are twenty-seven
branches, which Vaiśampáyana, the pupil of Vyása, compiled, and taught
to as many disciples <span id="fr_800"></span>[1](#fn_800.md). Amongst
these, Yájnawalkya, the son of Brahmaráta, was distinguished for piety
and obedience to his preceptor.

It had been formerly agreed by the Munis, that any one of them who, at a
certain time, did not join an assembly held on mount Meru should incur
the guilt of killing a Brahman, within a period of seven nights <span
id="fr_801"></span>[2](#fn_801.md). Vaiśampáyana alone failed to keep the
appointment, and consequently killed, by an accidental kick with his
foot, the child of his sister. He then addressed his scholars, and
desired them to perform the penance expiatory of Brahmanicide on his
behalf. Without any hesitation Yájnawalkya refused, and said, "How shall
I engage in penance with these miserable and inefficient Brahmans?" On
which his Guru, being incensed, commanded him to relinquish all that he
had learnt from him. "You speak contemptuously," he observed, "of these
young Brahmans, but of what use is a disciple who disobeys my commands?"
"I spoke," replied Yájnawalkya, "in perfect faith; but as to what I have
read from you, I have had enough: it is no more than this--" (acting as
if he would eject it from his stomach); when he brought up the texts of
the Yajush in substance stained with blood. He then departed. The other
scholars of Vaiśampáyana, transforming themselves to partridges
(Tittiri), picked

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

up the texts which he had disgorged, and which from that circumstance
were called Taittiríya <span id="fr_802"></span>[3](#fn_802.md); and the
disciples were called the Charaka professors of the Yajush, from
Charańa, 'going through' or 'performing' the expiatory rites enjoined by
their master <span id="fr_803"></span>[4](#fn_803.md).

Yájnawalkya, who was perfect in ascetic practices, addressed himself
strenuously to the sun, being anxious to recover possession of the texts
of the Yajush. "Glory to the sun," he exclaimed, "the gate of
liberation, the fountain of bright radiance, the triple source of
splendour, as the Rig, the Yajur, and the Sáma Vedas. Glory to him, who,
as fire and the moon, is one with the cause of the universe: to the sun,
that is charged with radiant heat, and with the Sushumna ray (by which
the moon is fed with light): to him who is one with the notion of time,
and all its divisions of hours, minutes, and seconds: to him who is to
be

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

meditated upon as the visible form of Vishńu, as the impersonation of
the mystic Om: to him who nourishes the troops of the gods, having
filled the moon with his rays; who feeds the Pitris with nectar and
ambrosia, and who nourishes mankind with rain; who pours down or absorbs
the waters in the time of the rains, of cold, and of heat. Glory be to
Brahmá, the sun, in the form of the three seasons: he who alone is the
dispeller of the darkness of this earth, of which he is the sovereign
lord: to the god who is clad in the raiment of purity be adoration.
Glory to the sun, until whose rising man is incapable of devout acts,
and water does not purify, and touched by whose rays the world is fitted
for religious rites: to him who is the centre and source of
purification. Glory to Savitrí, to Súrya, to Bháskara, to Vivaswat, to
Áditya, to the first-born of gods or demons. I adore the eye of the
universe, borne in a golden car, whose banners scatter ambrosia."

Thus eulogized by Yájnawalkya, the sun, in the form of a horse, appeared
to him, and said, "Demand what you desire." To which the sage, having
prostrated himself before the lord of day, replied, "Give me a knowledge
of those texts of the Yajush with which even my preceptor is
unacquainted." Accordingly the sun imparted to him the texts of the
Yajush called Ayátayáma (unstudied), which were unknown to Vaiśampáyana:
and because these were revealed by the sun in the form of a horse, the
Brahmans who study this portion of the Yajush are called Vájis (horses).
Fifteen branches of this school sprang from Kańwa and other pupils of
Yájnawalkya <span id="fr_804"></span>[5](#fn_804.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_800"></span>[279:1](vp079.htm#fr_800.md) The Váyu divides
these into three classes, containing each nine, and discriminated,
northern, middle, and eastern. Of these, the chiefs were severally
Śyámáyani, Áruńi, and Ánalavi, or Álambi. With some inconsistency,
however, the same authority states that Vaiśampáyana composed and gave
to his disciples eighty-six Sanhitás.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[279:2](vp079.htm#fr_801.md) The parallel passage
in the Váyu rather implies that the agreement was to meet within seven
nights.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[280:3](vp079.htm#fr_802.md) Also called the black
Yajush. No notice of this legend, as Mr. Colebrooke observes (As. Iles.
VIII. 376), occurs in the Veda itself; and the term Taittiríya is more
rationally accounted for in the Anukramańí or index of the black Yajush.
It is there said that Vaiśampáyana taught it to Yaska, who taught it to
Tittiri, who also became a teacher; whence the term Taittiríya, for a
grammatical rule explains it to mean, 'The Taittiríyas are those who
read what was said or repeated by Tittiri.' Páńini, 4. 3. 102. The
legend, then, appears to be nothing more than a Pauráńik invention,
suggested by the equivocal sense of Tittiri, a proper name or a
partridge. Much of the mythos of the Hindus, and obviously of that of
the Greeks and Romans, originates in this source. It was not confined,
at least amongst the former, to the case that Creuzer specifies; "Telle
ou telle expression cessa d’etre comprise, et l’on inventa des mythes
pour eclaircir ces malentendus;" but was wilfully perpetrated, even
where the word was understood, when it afforded a favourable opportunity
for a fable. It may be suspected in the present instance that the legend
is posterior, not only to the Veda, but to the grammatical rule, or it
would have furnished Páńini with a different etymology.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[280:4](vp079.htm#fr_803.md) This is another
specimen of the sort of Paronomasia explained in the preceding note. The
Charakas are the students of a Śákhá, so denominated from its teacher
Charaka. (As. Res. VIII. 377.) So, again, Páńini 4. 3. 107: 'The readers
of that which is said by Charaka are Charakas:' Charaka has no necessary
connexion with Chara, 'to go.' The Váyu states they were also called
Chat́akas, from Chat, 'to divide,' because they shared amongst them their
master's guilt. 'Those pupils of Vaiśampáyana were called Chat́akas by
whom the crime of Brahmanicide was shared; and Charakas from its
departure.'

<span id="fn_804"></span>[281:5](vp079.htm#fr_804.md) The Váyu names the
fifteen teachers of these schools, Kańwa, Vaidheya, Śálin, Madhyandina,
Sapeyin, Vidagdha, Uddálin, Támráyani, Vátsya, Gálava, Śaiśiri, Át́avya,
Parńa, Vírańa, and Sampárayana, who were the founders of no fewer than
101 branches of the Vájasaneyi, or white Yajush. Mr. Colebrooke
specifies several of these, as the Jábálas, Baudháyanas, Tápaníyas, &c.
As. Res. VIII. 376.
