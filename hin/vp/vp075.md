# VISHŃU PURÁŃA.

# BOOK III.

### CHAP. I.

Account of the several Manus and Manwantaras. Swárochisha the second
Manu: the divinities, the Indra, the seven Rishis of his period, and his
sons. Similar details of Auttami, Támasa, Raivata, Chákshusha, and
Vaivaswata. The forms of Vishńu, as the preserver, in each Manwantara.
The meaning of Vishńu.

MAITREYA.--The disposition of the earth and of the ocean, and the system
of the sun and the planets, the creation of the gods and the rest, the
origin of the Rishis, the generation of the four castes, the production
of brute creatures, and the narratives of Dhruva and Prahláda, have been
fully related by thee, my venerable preceptor. I am now desirous to hear
from you the series of all the Manwantaras, as well as an account of
those who preside over the respective periods, with Śakra, the king of
the gods, at their head.

PARÁŚARA.--I will repeat to you, Maitreya, in their order, the different
Manwantaras; those which are past, and those which are to come.

The first Manu was Swáyambhuva, then came Swárochisha, then Auttami,
then Támasa, then Raivata, then Chákshusha: these six Manus have passed
away. The Manu who presides over the seventh Manwantara, which is the
present period, is Vaivaswata, the son of the sun.

The period of Swáyambhuva Manu, in the beginning of the Kalpa, has
already been described by me, together with the gods, Rishis, and other
personages, who then flourished <span id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_743.md). I
will now, therefore, enumerate

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

the presiding gods, Rishis, and sons of the Manu, in the Manwantara of
Swárochisha <span id="fr_744"></span>[2](#fn_744.md). The deities of this
period (or the second Manwantara) were the classes called Párávatas and
Tushitas <span id="fr_745"></span>[3](#fn_745.md); and the king of the gods
was the mighty Vipaśchit. The seven Rishis <span
id="fr_746"></span>[4](#fn_746.md) were Úrja, Stambha,

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Práńa, Dattoli,
Rishabha, Niśchara, and Arvarívat; and Chaitra, Kimpurusha, and others,
were the Manu's sons <span id="fr_747"></span>[5](#fn_747.md).

In the third period, or Manwantara of Auttami <span
id="fr_748"></span>[6](#fn_748.md), Suśánti was the Indra, the king of the
gods; the orders of whom were the Sudhámas, Satyas, Śivas,
[Pradarśanas](errata.htm#10.md), and Vasavertis <span
id="fr_749"></span>[7](#fn_749.md); each of the five orders consisting of
twelve divinities. The seven sons of Vaśisht́ha were the seven
Rishis <span id="fr_750"></span>[8](#fn_750.md); and Aja, Paraśu, Divya,
and others, were the sons of the Manu <span
id="fr_751"></span>[9](#fn_751.md).

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

The Surúpas, Haris, Satyas, and Śudhís <span
id="fr_752"></span>[10](#fn_752.md) were the classes of gods, each
comprising twenty-seven, in the period of Támasa, the fourth Manu <span
id="fr_753"></span>[11](#fn_753.md). Śivi was the Indra, also designated by
his performance of a hundred sacrifices (or named Śatakratu). The seven
Rishis were Jyotirdhámá, Prithu, Kávya, Chaitra, Agni, Vanaka, and
Pivara <span id="fr_754"></span>[12](#fn_754.md). The sons of Támasa were
the mighty kings Nara, Khyáti, Śántahaya, Jánujangha, and others <span
id="fr_755"></span>[13](#fn_755.md).

In the fifth interval the Manu was Raivata <span
id="fr_756"></span>[14](#fn_756.md): the Indra was Vibhu: the classes of
gods, consisting of fourteen each, were the Amitábhas, Abhútarajasas,
Vaikunthas, and Sumedhasas <span id="fr_757"></span>[15](#fn_757.md): the
seven Rishis were

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hirańyaromá,
Vedasrí, Urddhabáhu, Vedabáhu, Sudháman, Parjanya, and Mahámuni <span
id="fr_758"></span>[16](#fn_758.md): the sons of Raivata were Balabandhu,
Susambhávya, Satyaka, and other valiant kings.

These four Manus, Swárochisha, Auttamí, Támasa, and Raivata, were all
descended from Priyavrata, who, in consequence of propitiating Vishńu by
his devotions, obtained these rulers of the Manwantaras for his
posterity.

Chákshusha was the Manu of the sixth period <span
id="fr_759"></span>[17](#fn_759.md): in which the Indra was Manojava: the
five classes of gods were the Ádyas, Prastútas, Bhavyas, Prithugas, and
the magnanimous Lekhas, eight of each <span
id="fr_760"></span>[18](#fn_760.md): Sumedhas, Virajas, Havishmat, Uttama,
Madhu, Abhináman, and Sahishńu were the seven sages <span
id="fr_761"></span>[19](#fn_761.md): the kings of the earth, the sons of
Chákshusha, were the powerful Uru, Puru, Śatadyumna, and others.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

The Manu of the present period is the wise lord of obsequies, the
illustrious offspring of the sun: the deities are the Ádityas, Vasus,
and Rudras; their sovereign is Purandara: Vaśisht́ha, Kaśyapa, Atri,
Jamadagni, Gautama, Viśwámitra, and Bharadwája are the seven Rishis: and
the nine pious sons of Vaivaswata Manu are the kings Ikshwáku, Nabhaga,
Dhrisht́a, Sanyáti, Narishyanta, Nábhanidisht́a, Karusha, Prishadhra, and
the celebrated Vasumat <span id="fr_762"></span>[20](#fn_762.md).

The unequalled energy of Vishńu combining with the quality of goodness,
and effecting the preservation of created things, presides over all the
Manwantaras in the form of a divinity. Of a portion of that divinity
Yajna was born in the Swáyambhuva Manwantara, the will-begotten progeny
of Ákútí <span id="fr_763"></span>[21](#fn_763.md). When the Swárochisha
Manwantara had arrived, that divine Yajna was born as Ajita, along with
the Tushita gods, the sons of Tushitá. In the third Manwantara, Tushita
was again born of Satyá, as Satya, along with the class of deities so
denominated. In the next period, Satya became Hari, along with the
Haris, the

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

children of Harí. The excellent Hari was again born in the Raivata
Manwantara, of Sambhúti, as Mánasa, along with the gods called
Abhútarajasas. In the next period, Vishńu was born of Vikunthi, as
Vaikuntha, along with the deities called Vaikunthas. In the present
Manwantara, Vishńu was again born as Vámana, the son of Kaśyapa by
Adití. With three paces he subdued the worlds, and gave them, freed from
all embarrassment, to Purandara <span id="fr_764"></span>[22](#fn_764.md).
These are the seven persons by whom, in the several Manwantaras, created
beings have been protected. Because this whole world has been pervaded
by the energy of the deity, he is entitled Vishńu, from the root Vis,
'to enter' or 'pervade;' for all the gods, the Manus, the seven Rishis,
the sons of the Manus, the Indras the sovereigns of the gods, all are
but the impersonated might of Vishńu <span
id="fr_765"></span>[23](#fn_765.md).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_743"></span>[259:1](vp075.htm#fr_743.md) The gods were said to
be the Yámas ([p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54).md); the Rishis were Maríchi,
Angiras, &c. ([p. 49](vp041.htm#page_49). n. [2](vp041.htm#fn_200).md); and
the sons were Priyavrata and Uttánapáda ([p. 53](vp041.htm#page_53).md).
The Váyu adds to the Yamas, the Ajitas, who share with the former, it
observes, sacrificial <span id="page_260">p. 260</span> offerings. The
Matsya, Padma, Bráhma P. and Hari Vanśa substitute for the sons, the
grandsons of Swáyambhuva, Agnídhra and the rest ([p.
162](vp058.htm#page_162).md).

<span id="fn_744"></span>[260:2](vp075.htm#fr_744.md) This Manu, according
to the legend of his birth in the Márkańd́eya P., was the son of
Swarochish, so named from the splendour of his appearance when born, and
who was the son of the nymph Varuthiní by the Gandharba Kali. The text,
in another place, makes him a son of Priyavrata.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[260:3](vp075.htm#fr_745.md) The Váyu gives the
names of the individuals of these two classes, consisting each of
twelve. It furnishes also the nomenclature of all the classes of
divinities, and of the sons of the Manus in each Manwantara. According
to the same authority, the Tushitas were the sons of Kratu: the
Bhágavata calls them the sons of Tushitá by Vedaśiras. The divinities of
each period are, according to the Váyu, those to whom offerings of the
Soma juice and the like are presented collectively.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[260:4](vp075.htm#fr_746.md) The Váyu describes
the Rishis of each Manwantara as the sons, or in some cases the
descendants in a direct line, of the seven sages, Atri, Angiras, Bhrigu,
Kaśyapa, Pulaha, Pulastya, and Vaśisht́ha; with some inconsistency, for
Kaśyapa, at least, did not appear himself until the seventh, Manwantara.
In the present series Úrja is the son of Vaśisht́ha, Stambha springs from
Kaśyapa, Práńa from Bhrigu, Dattoli is the son of Pulastya, Rishabha
descends from Angiras, Niśchara from Atri, and Arvarívat is the son of
Pulaha. The Bráhma P. and Hari Vanśa have a rather different list, or
Aurva, Stambha, Kaśyapa, Práńa, Vrihaspati, Chyavana, and Dattoli; but
the origin of part of this difference is nothing more than an imperfect
quotation from the Váyu Puráńa; the two first, Aurva and Stambha, being
specified as the son of Vaśisht́ha and the descendant of Kaśyapa, and
then the parentage of the rest being omitted: to complete the seven,
therefore, Kaśyapa becomes one of them. Some other errors of this nature
occur in these two works, and from the same cause, a blundering citation
of the Váyu, which is named as their authority. A curious peculiarity
also occurs in these mistakes. They are confined to the first eight
Manwantaras. The Bráhma P. omits all details of the last six, and the
Hari Vanśa inserts them fully and correctly, agreeably to the authority
of the Váyu. It looks, therefore, as if the compiler of the Hari Vanśa
had followed the Bráhma, as far as it went, right or wrong; but had had
recourse to the original Váyu P. when the Bráhma failed him. Dattoli is
sometimes written Dattoni and Dattotri; and the latter appears to have
been the case with the copy of the Hari Vanśa employed by M. Langlois,
who makes one of the Rishis of this Manwantara, "le penitent Atri." He
is not without countenance in some such reading, for the Padma P.
changes the name to Dattátreya, no doubt suggested by Datta-atri. <span
id="page_261">p. 261</span> Dattátreya, however, is the son of Atri;
whilst the Váyu calls the person of the text the son of Pulastya. There
can be no doubt therefore of the correct reading, for the son of
Pulastya is Dattoli. ([p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83)..md)

<span id="fn_747"></span>[261:5](vp075.htm#fr_747.md) The Váyu agrees with
the text in these names, adding seven others. The Bhágavata has a
different series. The Padma has four other names, Nabha, Nabhasya,
Prasriti, Bhavana. The Bráhma has ten names, including two of these, and
several of the names of the Rishis of the tenth Manwantara. The Matsya
has the four names of the Padma for the sons of the Manu, and gives
seven others, Havíndhra, Sukrita, Múrtti, Apas, Jyotir, Aya, Smrita (the
names of the Bráhma), as the seven Prajápatis of this period, and sons
of Vaśisht́ha. The sons of Vaśisht́ha, however, belong to the third
Manwantara, and bear different appellations. There is, no doubt, some
blundering here in all the books except the Váyu, and those which agree
with it.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[261:6](vp075.htm#fr_748.md) The name occurs
Auttami, Auttama, and Uttama. The Bhágavata and Váyu agree with our text
([p. 263](#page_263).md) in making him a descendant from Priyavrata. The
Márkańd́eya calls him the son of Uttama, the son of Uttánapáda: and this
appears to be the correct genealogy, both from our text and the
Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[261:7](vp075.htm#fr_749.md) The Bráhma and Hari
Vanśa have, in place of these, the Bhánus; but the Váyu and Márkańd́eya
concur with the text.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[261:8](vp075.htm#fr_750.md) All the authorities
agree in this; but the Bráhma and Hari Vanśa appear to furnish a
different series also; or even a third, according to the French
translation: 'Dans le troisième Manwantara parurent comme Saptarchis les
fils de Vasichtha, de son nom appelés Vâsichthas, les fils de
Hiranyagarbha et les illustres enfans d’Ourdja.' The text is, \#\#\# &c.
The meaning of which is, 'There were (in the first Manwantara) seven
celebrated sons of Vaśisht́ha, who (in the third Manwantara) were sons of
Brahmá (i. e. Rishis), the illustrious posterity of Urjjá. We have
already seen that Urjjá was the wife of Vaśisht́ha, by whom she had seven
sons, Rajas,' &c. (see [p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83).md), in the Swáyambhuva
Manwantara; and these were born again as the Rishis of the third period.
The names of these persons, according to the Matsya and Padma, are
however very different from those of the sons of Vaśisht́ha, given [p.
83](vp045.htm#page_83.md), or Kaukundihi, Kurundi, Dalaya, Śankha,
Praváhita, Mita, and Sammita.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[261:9](vp075.htm#fr_751.md) The Váyu adds ten
other names to those of the text. The Bráhma gives ten <span
id="page_262">p. 262</span> altogether different. The Bhágavata an Padma
have each a separate nomenclature.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[262:10](vp075.htm#fr_752.md) Of these, the Bráhma
and Hari V notice only the Satyas: the Matsya and Padma have only
Sádhyas. The Váyu Bhágavata, Kúrma, and Márkańd́eya agree with the text.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[262:11](vp075.htm#fr_753.md) He is the son of
Priyavrata, according to the text, the Váyu, &c. The Márkańd́eya has a
legend of his birth by a doe; and from his being begotten in dark,
tempestuous weather, he derives his name.

<span id="fn_754"></span>[262:12](vp075.htm#fr_754.md) Severally, according
to the Váyu, the progeny of Bhrigu, Kaśyapa, Angiras, Pulastya, Atri,
Vaśisht́ha, and Pulaha. There is considerable variety in some of the
names. Thus the Matsya has Kavi, Prithu, Agni, Salpa, Dhímat, Kapi,
Akapi. The Hari Vanśa has Kávya, Prithu, Agni, Jahnu, Dhátri, Kapivat,
Akapivat. For the two last the Váyu reads Gátra and Vanapítha. The son
of Pulaha is in his place ([p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83.md). n.
[6](vp045.htm#fn_245).md), Arvarívat or Vanakapívat. Gátra is amongst the
sons of Vaśisht́ha ([p. 83](vp045.htm#page_83).md). The Váyu is therefore
probably most correct, although our text, in regard to these two
denominations, admits of no doubt.

<span id="fn_755"></span>[262:13](vp075.htm#fr_755.md) The Váyu, &c. agree
with the text; the Váyu naming eleven. The Bráhma, Matsya, and Padma
have a series of ten names, Sutapas, Tapomúla, &c.; of which, seven are
the Rishis of the twelfth Manwantara.

<span id="fn_756"></span>[262:14](vp075.htm#fr_756.md) Raivata, as well as
his three predecessors, is regarded usually as a descendant of
Priyavrata. The Márkańd́eya has a long legend of his birth, as the son of
king Durgama by the nymph Revatí, sprung from the constellation Revatí,
whom Ritavách, a Muni, caused to fall from heaven. Her radiance became a
lake on mount Kumuda, thence called Raivataka; and from it appeared the
damsel, who was brought up by Pramucha Muni. Upon the marriage of
Revatí, the Muni, at her request, restored the asterism to its place in
the skies.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[262:15](vp075.htm#fr_757.md) The Bráhma inserts
of these only the Abhútarajasas, with the remark, that 'they were of
like nature (with their name):' i. e. they were exempt from the quality
of passion. M. Langlois, in rendering the parallel passage of the Hari
Vanśa, has confounded the epithet and the subject: 'dont les dieux
furent les Pracritis, dépourvu de <span id="page_263">p. 263</span>
colere et de passion.' He is also at a loss what to do with the terms
Páriplava and Raibhya, in the following passage; \#\#\# asking, 'qu’est
ce que Páriplava? qu’est ce que Rêbhya?' If he had had the commentary at
hand, these questions would have been unnecessary: they are there said
to be two classes of divinities.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[263:16](vp075.htm#fr_758.md) There is less
variety in these names than usual. Vedabáhu is read Devabáhu; Sudháman,
Satyanetra; and Mahámuni, Muni, Yajur, Váśisht́ha, and Yadudhra.
According to the Váyu, those of the text are respectively of the lineage
of Angiras, Bhrigu, Vaśisht́ha, Pulastya, Atri, Pulaha, and Kaśyapa.
There is considerable variety in the names of the Manu's sons.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[263:17](vp075.htm#fr_759.md) Chákshusha,
according to the best authorities, descended from Dhruva (see p. 98);
but the Márkańd́eya has a legend of his birth as the son of a Kshatriya,
named Anamitra; of his being exchanged at his birth for the son of
Viśránta Rájá, and being brought up by the prince as his own; of his
revealing the business when a man, and propitiating Brahmá by his
devotions; in consequence of which he became a Manu. In his former birth
he was born from the eye of Brahmá; whence his name, from Chakshush,
'the eye.'

<span id="fn_760"></span>[263:18](vp075.htm#fr_760.md) The authorities
agree as to the number, but differ as to the names; reading for Ádyas,
Áryás and Ápyas; for Prastútas, Prabhútas and Prasútas; for Prithugas,
Prithukas and Prithusas; and, which is a more wide deviation, Ribhus for
Bhavyas. M. Langlois omits the Prasútas, and inserts Divaukasas; but the
latter, meaning 'divinities,' is only an epithet. The Hari Vanśa has,
\#\#\#---. The comment adds, \#\#\#.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[263:19](vp075.htm#fr_761.md) The Váyu reads
Sudháman for the first name; Unnata for Uttama; and Abhimána for
Abhináman. The latter occurs also Abhinámin (Matsya) and Atináman (Hari
V.) The latter reads, no doubt incorrectly, Bhrigu, Nabha, and <span
id="page_264">p. 264</span> Vivaswat for Uttama, Madhu, and Havishmat.
The sons of Chákshusha are enumerated, [p. 98](vp048.htm#page_98.md).

<span id="fn_762"></span>[264:20](vp075.htm#fr_762.md) There is no great
variety of nomenclature in this Manwantara. The Váyu adds to the deities
the Sádhyas, Viśwas, Maruts, and gods sprung from Bhrigu and Angiras.
The Bhágavata adds the Ribhus: and most include the two Áswins as a
class. Of the Maruts, however, the Hari Vanśa remarks that they are born
in every Manwantara, seven times seven (or forty-nine); that in each
Manwantara four times seven, or twenty-eight, obtain emancipation, but
their places are filled up by persons reborn in that character. So the
commentator explains the passages \#\#\# and \#\#\# &c. \#\#\# Comment.
\#\#\# Comment. It may be suspected, however, that these passages have
been derived from the simple statement of the Matsya, that in all the
Manwantaras classes of Rishis appear by seven and seven, and having
established a code of law and morality, depart to felicity. The Váyu has
a rather different list of the seven Rishis; or Vasumat, the son of
Vaśisht́ha; Vatsára, descended from Kaśyapa; Viśwámitra, the son of
Gádhi, and of the Kuśika race; Jamadagni, son of Kuru, of the race of
Bhrigu; Bharadwája, son of Vrihaspati; Śaradwat, son of Gautama, of the
family of Utatthya; and Brahmakosha or Atri, descended from Brahmá. All
the other authorities agree with our text.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[264:21](vp075.htm#fr_763.md) The nominal father
being the patriarch Ruchi. (See [p. 54](vp041.htm#page_54)..md)

<span id="fn_764"></span>[265:22](vp075.htm#fr_764.md) There is no further
account of this incarnation in the Vishńu Puráńa. Fuller details occur
in the Bhágavata, Kúrma, Matsya, and Vámana Puráńas. The first of these
(b. VIII. c. 15-23) relates the penance and sacrifices of Bali, son of
Virochana, by which he had overcome Indra and the gods, and obtained
supreme dominion over the three spheres. Vishńu, at the request of the
deities, was born as a dwarf, Vámana, the son of Adití by Kaśyapa; who,
applying to Bali for alms, was promised by the prince whatever he might
demand, notwithstanding Śukra, the preceptor of the Daityas, apprised
him whom he had to deal with. The dwarf demanded as much space as he
could step over at three steps; and upon the assent of Bali, enlarged
himself to such dimensions as to stride over the three worlds. Being
worshipped however by Bali and his ancestor Prahláda, he conceded to
them the sovereignty of Pátála.

etymology, [p. 3](vp035.htm#page_3). n. [7](vp035.htm#fn_104.md).
