*The Vishnu Purana*, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson, \[1840\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

12\. The Varáha Puráńa

12\. Varáha Puráńa. "That in which the glory of the great Varáha is
predominant, as it was revealed to Earth by Vishńu, in connexion, wise
Munis, with the Mánava Kalpa, and which contains twenty-four thousand
verses, is called the Váráha Puráńa <span
id="fr_67"></span>[68](#fn_67.md)."

It may be doubted if the Varáha Puráńa of the present day is here
intended. It is narrated by Vishńu as Varáha, or in the boar
incarnation, to the personified Earth. Its extent, however, is not half
that specified, little exceeding ten thousand stanzas. It furnishes also
itself

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span>

evidence of the prior currency of some other work, similarly
denominated; as, in the description of Mathurá contained in it, Sumantu,
a Muni, is made to observe, "The divine Varáha in former times expounded
a Puráńa, for the purpose of solving the perplexity of Earth."

Nor can the Varáha Puráńa be regarded as a Puráńa agreeably to the
common definition, as it contains but a few scattered and brief
allusions to the creation of the world, and the reign of kings: it has
no detailed genealogies either of the patriarchal or regal families, and
no account of the reigns of the Manus. Like the Linga Puráńa, it is a
religious manual, almost wholly occupied with forms of prayer, and rules
for devotional observances, addressed to Vishńu; interspersed with
legendary illustrations, most of which are peculiar to itself, though
some are taken from the common and ancient stock: many of them, rather
incompatibly with the general scope of the compilation, relate to the
history of Śiva and Durgá <span id="fr_68"></span>[69](#fn_68.md). A
considerable portion of the work is devoted to descriptions of various
Tírthas, places of Vaishńava pilgrimage; and one of Mathurá enters into
a variety of particulars relating to the shrines of that city,
constituting the Mathurá Máhátmyam.

In the sectarianism of the Varáha Puráńa there is no leaning to the
particular adoration of Krishńa, nor are the Rath-yátrá and Janmásht́amí
included amongst the observances enjoined. There are other indications
of its belonging to an earlier stage of Vaishńava worship, and it may
perhaps be referred to the age of Rámánuja, the early part of the
twelfth century.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[xlv:69](vp016.htm#fr_68.md) One of these is
translated by Col. Vans Kennedy, the origin of the three Śaktis, or
goddesses, Saraswatí, Lakshmí, and Párvati. Ancient and Hindu Mythology,
p. 209. The Tri Śakti Máhátmya occurs, as he gives it, in my copy, and
is so far an indication of the identity of the Varáha Puráńa in the
different MSS.
