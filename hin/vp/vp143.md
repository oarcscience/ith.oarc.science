### CHAP. XXVI.

Krishńa carries off Rukminí: the princes who come to rescue her repulsed
by Balaráma. Rukmin overthrown, but spared by Krishńa, founds Bhojakat́a.
Pradyumna born of Rukminí.

BHÍSHMAKA was king of Vidarbha, residing at Kundina <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[1](#fn_1534.md). He had a son named Rukmin, and a
beautiful daughter termed Rukminí. Krishńa fell in love with the latter,
and solicited her in marriage; but her brother who hated Krishńa, would
not assent to the espousals. At the suggestion of Jarásandha, and with
the concurrence of his son, the powerful sovereign Bhíshmaka affianced
Rukminí to Śiśupála. In order to celebrate the nuptials, Jarásandha and
other princes, the friends of Śiśupála, assembled in the capital of
Vidarbha; and Krishńa, attended by Balabhadra and many other Yádavas,
also went to Kundina to witness the wedding. When there, Hari contrived,
on the eve of the nuptials, to carry off the princess <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[2](#fn_1535.md), leaving Ráma and his kinsmen to
sustain the weight of his enemies. Pauńd́raka, the illustrious
Dantavakra, Viduratha, Śiśupála, Jarásandha, Śalya, and other kings,
indignant at the insult, exerted themselves to kill Krishńa, but were
repelled by Balaráma and the Yádavas. Rukmin, vowing that he would never
enter Kundina again until he had slain Keśava in fight, pursued and
overtook him. In the combat that ensued, Krishńa destroyed with his
discus, as if in sport, the host of Rukmin, with all its horse, and
elephants, and foot, and chariots, and overthrew him, and hurled him on
the ground, and would have put him to death, but was withheld by the
entreaties of Rukminí. "He is my only brother," she exclaimed, "and must
not be slain by

<span id="page_574">p. 574</span>

thee: restrain your wrath, O divine lord, and give me my brother in
charity." Thus addressed by her, Krishńa, whom no acts affect, spared
Rukmín <span id="fr_1536"></span>[3](#fn_1536.md); and he (in pursuance of
his vow) founded the city Bhojakat́a <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[4](#fn_1537.md), and ever afterwards dwelt therein.
After the defeat of Rukmin, Krishńa married Rukminí in due form, having
first made her his own by the Rákshasa ritual <span
id="fr_1538"></span>[5](#fn_1538.md). She bore him the gallant Pradyumna, a
portion of the deity of love. The demon Sambara carried him off, but he
slew the demon.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1534"></span>[573:1](vp143.htm#fr_1534.md) Vidarbha is the
country of Berar, and the name remains in the present city of Beder: the
capital however, Kundinapur, is commonly identified with a place called
Kundapur, about forty miles north-east of Amarávatí (in Berar).

<span id="fn_1535"></span>[573:2](vp143.htm#fr_1535.md) When she had gone
forth from the city to worship Ambiká: Bhágavata. Indráńí, the wife of
Indra: Hari Vanśa. Our text tells the circumstance more concisely than
the others.

<span id="fn_1536"></span>[574:3](vp143.htm#fr_1536.md) After depriving him
of his eyebrows and hair. In the Bhágavata, Balaráma also interferes in
favour of Rukmin, and reproves Krishńa for disfiguring him.

<span id="fn_1537"></span>[574:4](vp143.htm#fr_1537.md) Of course this was
somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kundina or Vidarbha, and is usually
supposed to be situated on the Narmadá.

<span id="fn_1538"></span>[574:5](vp143.htm#fr_1538.md) That is, by
violence: thus Manu; "The seizure of a maiden by force, whilst she weeps
and calls for assistance, after her kinsmen and friends have been slain
in battle, or wounded, and their houses broken open, is the marriage
called Rákshasa." III. 33. According to the Bhágavata, Rukminí sends to
invite Krishńa to carry her off, and instructs him how to proceed.
