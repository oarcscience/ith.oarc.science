### CHAP. XIII.

Legend of Bharata. Bharata abdicates his throne, and becomes an ascetic:
cherishes a fawn, and becomes so much attached to it as to neglect his
devotions: he dies: his successive births: works in the fields, and is
pressed as a palankin-bearer for the Rájá of Sauvíra: rebuked for his
awkwardness: his reply: dialogue between him and the king.

MAITREYA.--Reverend sir <span id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_726.md), all that
I asked of you has been thoroughly explained; namely, the situation of
the earth, oceans, mountains, rivers, and planetary bodies; the system
of the three worlds, of which Vishńu is the stay. The great end of life
has also been expounded by you, and the preeminence of holy knowledge.
It now remains that you fulfil the promise you made some time
since <span id="fr_727"></span>[2](#fn_727.md), of relating to me the story
of king Bharata, and how it happened that a monarch like him, residing
constantly at the sacred place Śálagráma, and engaged in devotion, with
his mind ever applied to Vásudeva, should have failed, through time
sanctity of the shrine, and the efficacy of his abstractions, to obtain
final emancipation; how it was that he was born again as a Brahman; and
what was done by the magnanimous Bharata in that capacity: all this it
is fit that you inform me.

PARÁŚARA.--The illustrious monarch of the earth resided, Maitreya, for a
considerable period at Śálagráma, his thoughts being wholly dedicated to
god, and his conduct distinguished by kindness and every virtue, until
he had effected, in the highest degree, the entire control over his
mind. The Rájá was ever repeating the names, Yajneśa, Achyuta, Govinda,
Mádhava, Ananta, Keśava, Krishńa, Vishńu, Hrishikeśa; nothing else did
be utter, even in his dreams; nor upon anything but those names, and
their import, did he ever meditate. He accepted fuel, flowers, and holy
grass, for the worship of the deity, but

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

performed no other religious rites, being engrossed by disinterested,
abstract devotion.

On one occasion he went to the Mahanadi <span
id="fr_728"></span>[3](#fn_728.md), for the purpose of ablution: he bathed
there, and performed the ceremonies usual after bathing, Whilst thus
occupied, there came to the same place a doe big with young, who had
come out of the forest to drink of the stream. Whilst quenching her
thirst, there was heard on a sudden the loud and fearful roaring of a
lion; on which the doe, being excessively alarmed, jumped out of the
water upon the bank. In consequence of this great leap, her fawn was
suddenly brought forth, and fell into the river; and the king, seeing it
carried away by the current, caught hold of the young animal, and saved
it from being drowned. The injury received by the deer, by her violent
exertion, proved fatal, and she lay down, and died; which being observed
by the royal ascetic, he took the fawn in his arms, and returned with it
to his hermitage: there he fed it and tended it every day, and it throve
and grew up under his care. It frolicked about the cell, and grazed upon
the grass in its vicinity; and whenever it strayed to a distance, and
was alarmed at a wild beast, it ran back thither for safety. Every
morning it sallied forth from home, and every evening returned to the
thatched shelter of the leafy bower of Bharata.

Whilst the deer was thus the inmate of his hermitage, the mind of the
king was ever anxious about the animal, now wandering away, and now
returning to his side, and he was unable to think of anything else. He
had relinquished his kingdom, his children, all his friends, and now
indulged in selfish affection for a fawn. When absent for a longer time
than ordinary, he would fancy that it had been carried off by wolves,
devoured by a tiger, or slain by a lion. "The earth," he would exclaim,
"is embrowned by the impressions of its hoofs. What has become of the
young deer, that was born for my delight? How happy I should be

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

if he had returned from the thicket, and I felt his budding antlers
rubbing against my arm. These tufts of sacred grass, of which the heads
have been nibbled by his new teeth, look like pious lads chanting the
Sáma-veda <span id="fr_729"></span>[4](#fn_729.md)." Thus the Muni
meditated whenever the deer was long absent from him; and contemplated
him with a countenance animated with pleasure as he stood by his side.
His abstraction was interrupted, the spirit of the king being engrossed
by the fawn, even though he had abandoned family, wealth, and dominion.
The firmness of the prince's mind became unsteady, and wandered with the
wanderings of the young deer. In the course of time the king became
subject to its influence. He died, watched by the deer, with tears in
its eyes, like a son mourning for his father; and he himself, as he
expired, cast his eyes upon the animal, and thought of nothing else,
being wholly occupied with one idea.

In consequence of this predominant feeling at such a season, he was born
again, in the Jambumárga forests, as a deer <span
id="fr_730"></span>[5](#fn_730.md), with the faculty of recollecting his
former life; which recollection inspiring a distaste for the world, he
left his mother, and again repaired to the holy place Śálagráma.
Subsisting there upon dry grass and leaves, he atoned for the acts which
had led to his being born in such a condition; and upon his death he was
next born as a Brahman, still retaining the memory of his prior
existence. He was born in a pious and eminent family of ascetics, who
were rigid observers of devotional rites. Possessed of all true wisdom,
and acquainted with the essence of all sacred writings, he beheld soul
as contradistinguished from matter (Prakriti). Embued with knowledge of
self, he beheld the gods and all other beings as in reality the same. It
did not happen to him to undergo investiture with the Brahmanical
thread, nor to read the Vedas with a spiritual preceptor, nor to perform
ceremonies, nor to study the scriptures. Whenever spoken to, he replied
incoherently and in ungrammatical and unpolished

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

speech. His person was unclean, and he was clad in dirty garments.
Saliva dribbled from his mouth, and he was treated with contempt by all
the people. Regard for the consideration of the world is fatal to the
success of devotion. The ascetic who is despised of men attains the end
of his abstractions. Let therefore a holy man pursue the path of the
righteous, without murmuring; and though men contemn him, avoid
association with mankind. This, the counsel of Hirańyagarbha <span
id="fr_731"></span>[6](#fn_731.md), did the Brahman call to mind, and hence
assumed the appearance of a crazy ideot in the eyes of the world. His
food was raw pulse, potherbs, wild fruit, and grains of corn. Whatever
came in his way he ate, as part of a necessary, but temporary
infliction <span id="fr_732"></span>[7](#fn_732.md). Upon his father's
death he was set to work in the fields by his brothers and his nephews,
and fed by them with vile food; and as he was firm and stout of make,
and a simpleton in outward act, he was the slave of every one that chose
to employ him, receiving sustenance alone for his hire.

The head servant of the king of Sauvíra, looking upon him as an
indolent, untaught Brahman, thought him a fit person to work without pay
(and took him into his master's service to assist in carrying the
palankin.)

The king having ascended his litter, on one occasion, was proceeding to
the hermitage of Kapila, on the banks of the Ikshumatí river <span
id="fr_733"></span>[8](#fn_733.md), to consult the sage, to whom the
virtues leading to liberation were known, what was most desirable in a
world abounding with care and sorrow. Amongst those who by order of his
head servant had been compelled gratuitously to carry the litter was the
Brahman, who had been equally pressed into this duty, and who, endowed
with the only universal knowledge, and remembering his former existence,
bore the burden as the means of expiating the faults for which he was
desirous to atone. Fixing his eyes upon the pole, he went tardily along,
whilst the other

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

bearers moved with alacrity; and the king, feeling the litter carried
unevenly, called out, "Ho bearers! what is this? Keep equal pace
together." Still it proceeded unsteadily, and the Rájá again exclaimed,
"What is this? how irregularly are you going!" When this had repeatedly
occurred, the palankin-bearers at last replied to the king, "It is this
man, who lags in his pace." "How is this?" said the prince to the
Brahman, "are you weary? You have carried your burden but a little way;
are you unable to bear fatigue? and yet you look robust." The Brahman
answered and said, "It is not *I* who am robust, nor is it by me that
your palankin is carried. *I* am not wearied, prince, nor am *I*
incapable of fatigue." The king replied, "I clearly see that you are
stout, and that the palankin is borne by you; and the carriage of a
burden is wearisome to all persons." "First tell me," said the Brahman,
"what it is of me that you have clearly seen <span
id="fr_734"></span>[9](#fn_734.md), and then you may distinguish my
properties as strong or weak. The assertion that you behold the palankin
borne by me, or placed on me, is untrue. Listen, prince, to what I have
to remark. The place of both the feet is the ground; the legs are
supported by the feet; the thighs rest upon the legs; and the belly
reposes on the thighs; the chest is supported by the belly; and the arms
and shoulders are propped up by the chest: the palankin is borne upon
the shoulders, and how can it be considered as my burden? This body
which is seated in the palankin is defined as Thou; thence what is
elsewhere called This, is here distinguished as I and Thou. I and thou
and others are constructed of the elements; and the elements, following
the stream of qualities, assume a bodily shape; but qualities, such as
goodness and the rest, are dependant upon acts; and acts, accumulated in
ignorance, influence the condition of all beings <span
id="fr_735"></span>[10](#fn_735.md). The pure, imperishable soul, tranquil,
void of qualities, preeminent over nature (Prakriti), is one, without
increase or diminution, in all bodies. But if it be equally exempt from
increase or diminution, then with what propriety

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

can you say to me, 'I see that thou art robust?' If the palankin rests
on the shoulders, and they on the body; the body on the feet, and the
feet on the earth; then is the burden borne as much by you as by
me <span id="fr_736"></span>[11](#fn_736.md). When the nature of men is
different, either in its essence or its cause, then may it be said that
fatigue is to be undergone by me. That which is the substance of the
palankin is the substance of you and me and all others, being an
aggregate of elements, aggregated by individuality."

Having thus spoken, the Brahman was silent, and went on bearing the
palankin; but the king leaped out of it, and hastened to prostrate
himself at his feet; saying, "Have compassion on me, Brahman, and cast
aside the palankin; and tell me who thou art, thus disguised under the
appearance of a fool." The Brahman answered and said, "Hear me, Rája,.
Who I am it is not possible to say: arrival at any place is for the sake
of fruition; and enjoyment of pleasure, or endurance of pain, is the
cause of the production of the body. A living being assumes a corporeal
form to reap the results of virtue or vice. The universal cause of all
living creatures is virtue or vice: why therefore inquire the cause (of
my being the person I appear)." The king said, "Undoubtedly virtue and
vice are the causes of all existent effects, and migration into several
bodies is for the purpose of receiving their consequences; but with
respect to what you have asserted, that it is not possible for you to
tell me who you are, that is a matter which I am desirous to hear
explained. How can it be impossible, Brahman, for any one to declare
himself to be that which he is? There can be no detriment to one's-self
from applying to it the word *I*." The Brahman said, "It is true that
there is no wrong done to that which is one's-self by the application to
it of the word *I*; but the term is characteristic of error, of
conceiving that to be the self (or soul) which is not self or soul. The
tongue articulates the word *I*, aided by the lips, the teeth, and the
palate; and these are the origin of the expression, as they are the
causes of the production of speech. If by these instruments speech is
able to utter the word *I*, it is nevertheless

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

improper to assert that speech itself is *I* <span
id="fr_737"></span>[12](#fn_737.md). The body of a man, characterized by
hands, feet, and the like, is made up of various parts; to which of
these can I properly apply the denomination *I*? If another being is
different specifically from me, most excellent monarch, then it may be
said that *this* is I; *that* is the other: but when one only soul is
dispersed in all bodies, it is then idle to say, Who are you? who am I?
Thou art a king; this is a palankin; these are the bearers; these the
running footmen; this is thy retinue: yet it is untrue that all these
are said to be thine. The palankin on which thou sittest is made of
timber derived from a tree. What then? is it denominated either timber
or a tree? People do not say that the king is perched upon a tree, nor
that he is seated upon a piece of wood, when you have mounted your
palankin. The vehicle is an assemblage of pieces of timber, artificially
joined together: judge, prince, for yourself in what the palankin
differs really from the wood. Again; contemplate the sticks of the
umbrella, in their separate state. Where then is the umbrella? Apply
this reasoning to thee and to me <span id="fr_738"></span>[13](#fn_738.md).
A man, a woman, a cow, a goat, a horse, an elephant, a bird, a tree, are
names assigned to various bodies, which are the consequences of acts.
Man <span id="fr_739"></span>[14](#fn_739.md) is neither a god, nor a man,
nor a brute, nor a tree; these are mere varieties of shape, the effects
of acts. The thing which in the world is called a king, the servant of a
king, or by any other appellation, is not a reality; it is the creature
of our imaginations: for what is there in the world, that is subject to
vicissitude, that does not in the course of time go by different names.
Thou art called the monarch of the world; the son of thy father; the
enemy

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

of thy foes; the husband of thy wife; the father of thy children. What
shall I denominate thee? How art thou situated? Art thou the head or the
belly? or are they thine? Art thou the feet? or do they belong to thee?
Thou art, oh king, distinct in thy nature from all thy members! Now
then, rightly understanding the question, think who I am; and how it is
possible for me, after the truth is ascertained (of the identity of
all), to recognise any distinction, or to speak of my own individuality
by the expression *I*.'

<span id="fn_726"></span>[243:1](vp071.htm#fr_726.md) One copy addresses
Paráśara, Bhagavan sarvabhutesa, 'Sacred sovereign, lord of all
creatures;' rather an unusual title for a sage, even though an inspired
one. The other two copies begin, Samyagákhyátam, 'All has been

<span id="fn_728"></span>[244:3](vp071.htm#fr_728.md) The Mahánadí is
properly a river in Orissa, but the name is applicable to any great
stream, and its connexion with Śálagráma Tírtha makes it probable that
it is intended for the Gandaki or Gandaka, in which the Śálagram or
Ammonite is most abundantly found. It may be here noticed that Śálagráma
is named amongst the Tírthas in the Mahábhárata: see [p.
163](vp058.htm#page_163.md).

<span id="fn_729"></span>[245:4](vp071.htm#fr_729.md) The applicability of
this simile is not explained by the commentator: it refers possibly to
the cropped or shaven heads of the religious students.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[245:5](vp071.htm#fr_730.md) According to the
Bhágavata, Jambumárga is the Kálanjara mountain or Kalanjar in
Bundelkhand.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[246:6](vp071.htm#fr_731.md) Hirańyagarbha or

<span id="fn_732"></span>[246:7](vp071.htm#fr_732.md) As a Kála sanyama, a
state of suffering or mortification lasting only for a season; or, in
other words, bodily existence; the body being contemplated as a sore,
for which food is the unguent; drink, the lotion; and dress, the
bandage.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[246:8](vp071.htm#fr_733.md) A river in the north
of India.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[247:9](vp071.htm#fr_734.md) That is, What have
you discerned of me, my body, life, or soul?

<span id="fn_735"></span>[247:10](vp071.htm#fr_735.md) The condition--that
is, the personal individuality--of any one is the consequence of his
acts; but the same living principle animates him which is common to all
living things.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[248:11](vp071.htm#fr_736.md) The body is not the
individual; therefore it is not the individual, but the body, or
eventually the earth, which bears the burden.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[249:12](vp071.htm#fr_737.md) That is, speech, or
any or all of the faculties or senses, is not soul.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[249:13](vp071.htm#fr_738.md) The aggregate limbs
and senses no more constitute the individual, than the accidental
combination of certain pieces of wood makes the fabric anything else
than wood: in like manner as the machine is still timber, so the body is
still mere elementary matter. Again; the senses and limbs, considered
separately, no more constitute the man, than each individual stick
constitutes the umbrella. Whether separate or conjoined, therefore, the
parts of the body are mere matter; and as matter does not make up man,
they do not constitute an individual.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[249:14](vp071.htm#fr_739.md) T́he term in this and
the preceding clause is Pumán; here used generically, there
specifically.
