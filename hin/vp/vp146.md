### CHAP. XXIX.

Indra comes to Dwáraká, and reports to Krishńa the tyranny of Naraka.
Krishńa goes to his city, and puts him to death. Earth gives the
earrings of Adití to Krishńa, and praises him. He liberates the
princesses made captive by Naraka, sends them to Dwáraká, and goes to
Swarga with Satyabhámá.

ŚAKRA, the lord of the three worlds, came mounted on his fierce elephant
Airávata to visit Śauri (Krishńa) at Dwáraká. Having entered the city,
and been welcomed by Hari, he related to the hero the deeds of the demon
Naraka. "By thee, Madhusúdana, lord of the gods," said Indra, "in a
mortal condition, all sufferings have been soothed. Arisht́a, Dhenuka,
Cháńúra, Musht́ika, Keśin, who sought to injure helpless man, have all
been slain by thee. Kansa, Kuvalayápíd́a, the child-destroying Putaná,
have been killed by thee; and so have other oppressors of the world. By
thy valour and wisdom the three worlds have been preserved, and the
gods, obtaining their share of the sacrifices offered by the devout,
enjoy satisfaction. But now hear the occasion on which I have come to
thee, and which thou art able to remedy. The son of the earth <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[1](#fn_1546.md), called Naraka, who rules over the
city of Prágjyotisha <span id="fr_1547"></span>[2](#fn_1547.md), inflicts a
great injury upon all creatures. Carrying off the maidens of gods,
saints, demons, and kings, he shuts them up in his own palace. He has
taken away the umbrella of Varuńa, impermeable to water, the jewel
mountain crest of Mandara, and the celestial nectar-dropping earrings of
my mother Adití; and he now demands my elephant Airávata. I have thus
explained to you, Govinda, the tyranny of the Asura; you can best
determine how it is to be prevented."

Having heard this account, the divine Hari gently smiled, and, rising
from his throne, took Indra by the hand: then wishing for the eater of

<span id="page_582">p. 582</span>

the serpents, Garud́a immediately appeared; upon whom his master, having
first seated Satyabhámá upon his back, ascended, and flew to
Prágjyotisha. Indra mounted his elephant, and, in the sight of the
inhabitants of Dwáraká, went to the abode of the gods.

The environs of Prágjyotisha were defended by nooses, constructed by the
demon Muru, the edges of which were as sharp as razors; but Hari,
throwing his discus Sudarśana amongst them, cut them to pieces. Then
Muni started up, but Keśava slew him, and burnt his seven thousand sons,
like moths, with the flame of the edge of his discus. Having slain Mum,
Hayagriva, and Panchajana, the wise Hari rapidly reached the city of
Prágjyotisha: there a fierce conflict took place with the troops of
Naraka, in which Govinda destroyed thousands of demons; and when Naraka
came into the field, showering upon the deity all sorts of weapons, the
wielder of the discus, and annihilator of the demon tribe, cut him in
two with his celestial missile. Naraka being slain, Earth, bearing the
two earrings of Adití, approached the lord of the world, and said,
"When, O lord, I was upheld by thee in the form of a boar, thy contact
then engendered this my son. He whom thou gayest me has now been killed
by thee: take therefore these two earrings, and cherish his progeny.
Thou, lord, whose aspect is ever gracious, hast come to this sphere, in
a portion of thyself, to lighten my burden. Thou art the eternal
creator, preserver, and destroyer of the universe; the origin of all
worlds, and one with the universe: what praise can be worthily offered
to thee? Thou art the pervader, and that which is pervaded; the act, the
agent, and the effect; the universal spirit of all beings: what praise
can be worthily offered to thee? Thou art the abstract soul, the
sentient and the living soul of all beings, the imperishable: but since
it is not possible to praise thee worthily, then why should the hopeless
attempt proceed? Have compassion, O universal soul, and forgive the sins
which Naraka has committed. Verily it is for the sanctification of thy
son that he has been killed by thee." The lord, who is the substance of
all creatures, having replied to the earth, "Even so," proceeded to
redeem the various gems from the dwelling of Naraka. In the apartments
of the women he found sixteen thousand and one hundred

<span id="page_583">p. 583</span>

damsels <span id="fr_1548"></span>[3](#fn_1548.md): he also beheld in the
palace six thousand large elephants, each having four tusks; twenty-one
lakhs of horses of Kámboja and other excellent breeds: these Govinda
dispatched to Dwaraká, in charge of the servants of Naraka. The umbrella
of Varuńa, the jewel mountain, which he also recovered, he placed upon
Garud́a; and mounting him himself, and taking Satyabhámá with him, he set
off to the heaven of the gods, to restore the earrings of Adití <span

princesses, according to the Bhágavata; Apsarasas, or celestial nymphs,
according to the Káliká P.; and these upon their rescue by Krishńa
became his wives.

<span id="fn_1549"></span>[583:4](vp146.htm#fr_1549.md) The legend of
Naraka is related in more detail in the Bhágavata and Hari Vanśa, but is
still more fully narrated in the Káliká Upa-puráńa. It may be considered
as one of the various intimations that occur in the Puráńas of
hostilities between the worshippers of Vishńu and Śiva; Naraka being in
an especial degree favoured by the latter.
