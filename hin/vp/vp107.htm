The sons of &Aacute;huka were Devaka and Ugrasena.

On the birth of Vasudeva, who was one of these sons, the gods, to whom the future is manifest, foresaw that the divine being would take a human form in his family, and thereupon they sounded with joy the drums of heaven: from this circumstance Vasudeva was also called &Aacute;nakadunbubhi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1177"></A><A HREF="#fn_1177"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A>.

<p>&#346;&uacute;ra had a friend named Kuntibhoja, to whom, as he had no children, the presented in due form his daughter Pritha. She was married to Pan&#769;d&#769;u, and bore him Yudhisht&#769;hira, Bh&iacute;ma, and Arjuna, who were in fact the sons of the deities Dharma, V&aacute;yu (air), and Indra. Whilst she was yet unmarried, also, she had a son named Karn&#769;a, begotten by the divine &Aacute;ditya (the sun). Pan&#769;d&#769;u had another wife, named M&aacute;dr&iacute;, who had by the twin sons of &Aacute;ditya, N&aacute;satya and Dasra, two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1178"></A><A HREF="#fn_1178"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>&#346;rutadev&aacute; was married to the K&aacute;rusha prince Vriddha&#347;arman, and bore him the fierce Asura Dantavaktra. Dhrisht&#769;aketu, raja of Kaikeya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1179"></A><A HREF="#fn_1179"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A>, married &#346;rutak&iacute;rtti, and had by her Santarddana and four other sons, known as the five Kaikeyas. Jayasena, king of Avanti, married R&aacute;j&aacute;dhidev&iacute;, and had Vinda and Anavinda. &#346;ruta&#347;ravas was wedded to Damaghosha, raja of Chedi, and bore him &#346;i&#347;up&aacute;la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1180"></A><A HREF="#fn_1180"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A>. This prince was in a former existence the unrighteous but valiant monarch of the Daityas, Hiran&#769;yaka&#347;ipu, who was killed by the divine guardian of creation (in the man-lion Avat&aacute;ra). He was next the ten-headed sovereign R&aacute;van&#769;a, whose unequalled prowess, strength, and power were overcome by the lord of the three worlds, R&aacute;ma. Having been killed by the deity in the form of R&aacute;ghava, he had long enjoyed the reward of his virtues in exemption from an embodied state, but had now received birth once more as &#346;i&#347;up&aacute;la, the son of Damaghosha, king of Chedi. In this character he renewed, with greater inveteracy than ever, his hostile hatred towards the god surnamed Pun&#769;d&#769;arik&aacute;ksha, a portion of the supreme being, who had descended to lighten the burdens of the earth; and was in consequence slain by him: but from the circumstance of his thoughts being constantly engrossed by the supreme being, &#346;i&#347;up&aacute;la was united with him after death; for the lord giveth to those to whom he is favourable whatever they desire, and he bestows a heavenly and exalted station even upon those whom he slays in his displeasure.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1162"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1162">435:2</A> The Agni makes these all brother's sons of Satyaka, and adds another, Rishabha, the father of &#346;waphalka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1163"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1163">435:3</A> The authorities are not agreed here. &#346;waphalka, according to the Agni, as just remarked, comes from &#346;ini, the son of Anamitra. The Bh&aacute;gavata, instead of Pri&#347;ni, has Vrishn&#769;i, son of Anamitra; the Br&aacute;hma and Hari V. have Vrishn&#769;i; and the Agni, Prishn&#769;i, son of Yudh&aacute;jit. The Matsya also makes Yudh&aacute;jit the ancestor of Akr&uacute;ra, through Rishabha and Jayanta. Yudh&aacute;jit in the Br&aacute;hma, &amp;c. is the son of Krosht&#769;ri.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1164"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1164">435:4</A> The different authorities vary in the reading of these names, though they generally concur in the number.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1165"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1165">435:5</A> The Matsya and Padma call them sons of Akr&uacute;ra, but no doubt incorrectly.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1167"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1167">435:7</A> Vrishn&#769;i: Bh&aacute;gavata, V&aacute;yu, Matsya, &amp;c. Dhrisht&#769;a: Agni. Dhrishn&#769;u: Br&aacute;hma, Hari V.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1168"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1168">435:8</A> The Bh&aacute;gavata puts Viloman first. The Linga makes it an epithet of Kapotaroman, saying he was Vilomaja, 'irregularly begotten.' In place of Viloman we have Raivata, V&aacute;yu; Taittiri, Matsya; Tittiri, Agni.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1169"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1169">436:9</A> Nava: Agni. Bala: Linga. Nala: Matsya. Tomas: K&uacute;rma. Anu: Bh&aacute;gavata.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1170"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1170">436:10</A> The Matsya, V&aacute;yu, and Agni agree with our text. The Linga, Padma, and K&uacute;rma read &Aacute;nakadundubhi as a synonyme of Bala. The Br&aacute;hma and Hari V. have no such name, but here insert Punarvasu, son of Taittiri. The Bh&aacute;gavata has a different series, or Anu, Andhaka, Dundubhi, Arijit, Punarvasu, &Aacute;huka.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1171"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1171">436:11</A> This Bhajam&aacute;na is the son of Andhaka, according to all the best authorities; so the Padma calls this branch the &Aacute;ndhakas. The Agni makes him the son of Babhru.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1172"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1172">436:12</A> V&aacute;ta, Niv&aacute;ta, &#346;amin: V&aacute;yu.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1176"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1176">436:16</A> Dev&aacute;rha: V&aacute;yu, Padma, Agni, and Matsya; and a different series follows, or Kambalavarhish, Asamaujas, Samaujas, Sudanstra, Suva&#347;a, Dhrisht&#769;a, Anamitra, Nighna, Satr&aacute;jit. They all make Vasudeva the son of &#346;&uacute;ra, however; but the three first leave it doubtful whether that &#346;&uacute;ra was the son of Bhajam&aacute;na or not. The Bh&aacute;gavata and Br&aacute;hma agree with the text, which is probably correct. The Br&aacute;hma has &#346;&uacute;ra son of Devam&iacute;d&#769;hush, although it does not specify the latter amongst the sons of Hridika.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1177"></A><A HREF="vp107.htm#fr_1177">436:17</A> &Aacute;naka a larger, and Dundubhi a smaller drum.</P>
