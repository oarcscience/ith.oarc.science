PARÁŚARA said, Glory to the unchangeable, holy, eternal, supreme Vishńu,
of one universal nature, the mighty over all: to him who is
Hiranygarbha, Hari, and Śankara <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md),
the creator, the preserver, and destroyer of

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

the world: to Vásudeva, the liberator of his worshippers: to him, whose
essence is both single and manifold; who is both subtile and corporeal,
indiscrete and discrete: to Vishńu, the cause of final
emancipation <span id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_115.md), Glory to the supreme
Vishńu, the cause of the creation, existence, and end of this world; who
is the root of the world, and who consists of the world <span
id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_116.md).

Having glorified him who is the support of all things; who is the
smallest of the small <span id="fr_117"></span>[4](#fn_117.md); who is in
all created things; the unchanged, imperishable <span
id="fr_118"></span>[5](#fn_118.md) Purushottama <span
id="fr_119"></span>[6](#fn_119.md); who is one with true wisdom, as truly
known <span id="fr_120"></span>[7](#fn_120.md); eternal and incorrupt; and
who is known through false appearances by the nature of visible
objects <span id="fr_121"></span>[8](#fn_121.md): having bowed to Vishńu,
the

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

destroyer, and lord of creation and preservation; the ruler of the
world; unborn, imperishable, undecaying: I will relate to you that which
was originally imparted by the great father of all (Brahmá), in answer
to the questions of Daksha and other venerable sages, and repeated by
them to Purukutsa, a king who reigned on the banks of the Narmadá. It
was next related by him to Sáraswata, and by Sáraswata to me <span
id="fr_122"></span>[9](#fn_122.md).

Who can describe him who is not to be apprehended by the senses: who is
the best of all things; the supreme soul, self-existent: who is devoid
of all the distinguishing characteristics of complexion, caste, or the
like; and is exempt front birth, vicissitude, death, or decay: who is
always, and alone: who exists every where, and in whom all things here
exist; and who is thence named Vásudeva <span
id="fr_123"></span>[10](#fn_123.md)? He is Brahma <span
id="fr_124"></span>[11](#fn_124.md), supreme, lord, eternal, unborn,
imperishable, undecaying; of one essence; ever pure as free from
defects. He, that Brahma, was all things; comprehending in his own
nature the indiscrete and discrete. He then existed in the forms of
Purusha and of Kála. Purusha (spirit) is the first form, of the supreme;
next proceeded two other forms, the discrete and indiscrete; and Kála
(time) was the last. These four--Pradhána (primary or crude matter),
Purusha (spirit), Vyakta (visible substance), and Kála (time)--the wise
consider to be the pure and supreme condition of Vishńu <span
id="fr_125"></span>[12](#fn_125.md). These four forms, in their due
proportions, are the causes of

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

the production of the phenomena of creation, preservation, and
destruction. Vishńu being thus discrete and indiscrete substance,
spirit, and time, sports like a playful boy, as you shall learn by
listening to his frolics <span id="fr_126"></span>[13](#fn_126.md).

That chief principle (Pradhána), which is the indiscrete cause, is
called by the sages also Prakriti (nature): it is subtile, uniform, and
comprehends what is and what is not (or both causes and effects); is
durable, self-sustained, illimitable, undecaying, and stable; devoid of
sound or touch, and possessing neither colour nor form; endowed with the
three qualities (in equilibrium); the mother of the world; without
beginning; and that into which all that is produced is resolved <span
id="fr_127"></span>[14](#fn_127.md). By

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

that principle all things were invested in the period subsequent to the
last dissolution of the universe, and prior to creation <span
id="fr_128"></span>[15](#fn_128.md). For Brahmans learned in the Vedas, and
teaching truly their doctrines, explain such

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

passages as the following as intending the production of the chief
principle (Pradhána). "There was neither day nor night, nor sky nor
earth, nor darkness nor light, nor any other thing, save only One,
unapprehensible by intellect, or That which is Brahma and Pumán (spirit)
and Pradhána (matter) <span id="fr_129"></span>[16](#fn_129.md)." The two
forms which are other than the essence of unmodified Vishńu, are
Pradhána (matter) and Purusha (spirit); and his other form, by which
those two are connected or separated, is called Kála (time) <span
id="fr_130"></span>[17](#fn_130.md). When discrete substance is aggregated
in crude nature, as in a foregone dissolution, that dissolution is
termed elemental (Prákrita). The deity as Time is without beginning, and
his end is not known; and from him the revolutions of creation,
continuance, and dissolution unintermittingly succeed: for when, in the
latter season, the equilibrium of the qualities (Pradhána) exists, and
spirit (Pumán) is detached from matter, then the form of Vishńu which is
Time abides <span id="fr_131"></span>[18](#fn_131.md). Then the

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

supreme Brahma, the supreme soul, the substance of the world, the lord
of all creatures, the universal soul, the supreme ruler, Hari, of his
own will having entered into matter and spirit, agitated the mutable and
immutable principles, the season of creation being arrived, in the same
manner as fragrance affects the mind from its proximity merely, and not
from any immediate operation upon mind itself: so the Supreme influenced
the elements of creation <span id="fr_132"></span>[19](#fn_132.md).
Purushottama is both the agitator and

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

the thing to be agitated; being present in the essence of matter, both
when it is contracted and expanded <span
id="fr_133"></span>[20](#fn_133.md). Vishńu, supreme over the supreme, is
of the nature of discrete forms in the atomic productions, Brahmá and
the rest (gods, men, &c.)

Then from that equilibrium of the qualities (Pradhána), presided over by
soul <span id="fr_134"></span>[21](#fn_134.md), proceeds the unequal
developement of those qualities (constituting the principle Mahat or
Intellect) at the time of creation <span
id="fr_135"></span>[22](#fn_135.md). The

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chief principle
then invests that Great principle, Intellect, and it becomes threefold,
as affected by the quality of goodness, foulness, or darkness, and
invested by the Chief principle (matter) as seed is by its skin. From
the Great principle (Mahat) Intellect, threefold Egotism,
(Ahankára) <span id="fr_136"></span>[23](#fn_136.md),

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

denominated Vaikaríka, 'pure;' Taijasa, 'passionate;' and Bhútádi,
'rudimental,' <span id="fr_137"></span>[24](#fn_137.md) is produced; the
origin of the (subtile) elements, and of the organs of sense; invested,
in consequence of its three qualities, by Intellect, as Intellect is by
the Chief principle. Elementary Egotism then becoming productive, as the
rudiment of sound, produced from it Ether, of which sound is the
characteristic, investing it with its rudiment of sound. Ether becoming
productive, engendered the rudiment of touch; whence originated strong
wind, the property of which is touch; and Ether, with the rudiment of
sound, enveloped the rudiment of touch. Then wind becoming productive,
produced the rudiment of form (colour); whence light (or fire)
proceeded, of which, form (colour) is the attribute; and the rudiment of
touch enveloped the wind with the rudiment of colour. Light becoming
productive, produced the rudiment of taste; whence proceed all juices in
which flavour resides; and the rudiment of colour invested the juices
with the rudiment of taste. The waters becoming productive, engendered
the rudiment of smell; whence an aggregate (earth) originates, of which
smell is the property <span id="fr_138"></span>[25](#fn_138.md). In each
several

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

element resides its peculiar rudiment; thence the property of
tanmátratá, <span id="fr_139"></span>[26](#fn_139) (type or rudiment.md) is
ascribed to these elements. Rudimental elements are not endowed with
qualities, and therefore they are neither soothing, nor terrific, nor
stupifying <span id="fr_140"></span>[27](#fn_140.md). This is the elemental
creation, proceeding from the principle of egotism affected by the
property of darkness. The organs of sense are said to be the passionate
products of the same principle, affected by foulness; and the ten
divinities <span id="fr_141"></span>[28](#fn_141.md) proceed from egotism
affected by the principle of goodness; as does Mind, which

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

is the eleventh. The organs of sense are ten: of the ten, five are the
skin, eye, nose, tongue, and ear; the object of which, combined with
Intellect, is the apprehension of sound and the rest: the organs of
excretion and procreation, the hands, the feet, and the voice, form the
other five; of which excretion, generation, manipulation, motion, and
speaking, are the several acts.

Then, ether, air, light, water, and earth, severally united with the
properties of sound and the rest, existed as distinguishable according
to their qualities, as soothing, terrific, or stupifying; but possessing
various energies, and being unconnected, they could not, without
combination, create living beings, not having blended with each other.
Having combined, therefore, with one another, they assumed, through
their mutual association, the character of one mass of entire unity; and
from the direction of spirit, with the acquiescence of the indiscrete
Principle <span id="fr_142"></span>[29](#fn_142.md), Intellect and the
rest, to the gross elements inclusive, formed an egg <span
id="fr_143"></span>[30](#fn_143.md), which gradually expanded like a bubble
of water. This vast egg, O sage, compounded of the elements, and resting
on the waters, was the

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

excellent natural abode of Vishńu in the form of Brahmá; and there
Vishńu, the lord of the universe, whose essence is inscrutable, assumed
a perceptible form, and even he himself abided in it in the character of
Brahmá <span id="fr_144"></span>[31](#fn_144.md). Its womb, vast as the
mountain Meru, was composed of the mountains; and the mighty oceans were
the waters that filled its cavity. In that egg, O Brahman, were the
continents and seas and mountains, the planets and divisions of the
universe, the gods, the demons, and mankind. And this egg was externally
invested by seven natural envelopes, or by water, air, fire, ether, and
Ahankára the origin of the elements, each tenfold the extent of that
which it invested; next came the principle of Intelligence; and,
finally, the whole was surrounded by the indiscrete Principle:
resembling thus the cocoa-nut, filled interiorly with pulp, and
exteriorly covered by husk and rind.

Affecting then the quality of activity, Hari, the lord of all, himself
becoming Brahmá, engaged in the creation of the universe. Vishńu with
the quality of goodness, and of immeasurable power, preserves created
things through successive ages, until the close of the period termed a
Kalpa; when the same mighty deity, Janárddana <span
id="fr_145"></span>[32](#fn_145.md), invested with the quality of darkness,
assumes the awful form of Rudra, and swallows up the universe. Having
thus devoured all things, and converted the world into one vast ocean,
the Supreme reposes upon his mighty serpent couch amidst the deep: he
awakes after a season, and again, as Brahmá, becomes the author of
creation.

Thus the one only god, Janárddana, takes the designation of Brahmá,
Vishńu, and Śiva, accordingly as he creates, preserves, or
destroys <span id="fr_146"></span>[33](#fn_146.md).

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vishńu as creator,
creates himself; as preserver, preserves himself; as destroyer, destroys
himself at the end of all things. This world of earth, air, fire, water,
ether, the senses, and the mind; all that is termed spirit <span
id="fr_147"></span>[34](#fn_147.md), that also is the lord of all elements,
the universal form, and imperishable: hence he is the cause of creation,
preservation, and destruction; and the subject of the vicissitudes
inherent in elementary nature <span id="fr_148"></span>[35](#fn_148.md). He
is the object and author of creation: he preserves, destroys, and is
preserved. He, Vishńu, as Brahmá, and as all other beings, is infinite
form: he is the supreme, the giver of all good, the fountain of all
happiness <span id="fr_149"></span>[36](#fn_149.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_114"></span>[7:1](vp036.htm#fr_114.md) The three hypostases of
Vishńu. Hirańyagarbha is a name of Brahmá; he who was born from the
golden egg. Hari is Vishńu, and Śankara Siva. The Vishńu who is the
subject of our text is the supreme being in all these three divinities
or hypostases, in his different characters of creator, preserver and
destroyer. Thus in the Márkańd́eya: 'Accordingly, as the primal
all-pervading spirit is distinguished by attributes in creation and the
rest, so he obtains the denomination of Brahmá, Vishńu, and Śiva. In the
capacity of Brahmá he creates the worlds; in that of Rudra he destroys
them; in that of Vishńu he is quiescent. These are the three Avasthás
(ht. hypostases) of the self-born. Brahmá is the quality of activity;
Rudra that of darkness; Vishńu, the lord of the world, is goodness: so,
therefore, the three gods are the three qualities. They are ever
combined with, and dependent upon one another; and they are never for an
instant separate; they never quit each other.' The notion is one common
to all antiquity, although less philosophically conceived, or perhaps
less distinctly expressed, in the passages which have come down to us.
The τρεῖς ἀρχικὰς ὑποστάσεις of Plato are said by Cudworth (I. 111),
upon the authority of Plotinus, to be an ancient doctrine, παλαιὰ δόξα:
and he also observes, "Orpheus, Pythagoras, and Plato have all of them
asserted a trinity of divine hypostases; and as they unquestionably
derived much of their doctrine from the Egyptians, it may reasonably be
suspected that the Egyptians did the like before them." As however the
Grecian accounts, and those of the Egyptians, are much more perplexed
and unsatisfactory than those of the Hindus, it is most probable that we
find amongst them the doctrine in its most original as well as most
methodical and significant form.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[8:2](vp036.htm#fr_115.md) This address to Vishńu
pursues the notion that he, as the supreme being, is one, whilst he is
all: he is Avikára, not subject to change; Sadaikarúpa, one invariable
nature: he is the liberator (tára), or he who bears mortals across the
ocean of existence: he is both single and manifold (ekánekarúpa): and he
is the indiscrete (avyakta) cause of the world, as well as the discrete
(vyakta) effect; or the invisible cause, and visible creation.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[8:3](vp036.htm#fr_116.md) Jaganmaya, made up, or
consisting substantially of the world. Maya is an affix denoting 'made'
or 'consisting of,' as Kásht́ha maya, 'made of wood.' The world is
therefore not regarded by the Pauranics as an emanation or an illusion,
but as consubstantial with its first cause.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[8:4](vp036.htm#fr_117.md) Ańíyánsam ańíyasám,
'the most atomic of the atomic;' alluding to the atomic theory of the
Nyáya or logical school.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[8:5](vp036.htm#fr_118.md) Or Achyuta; a common
name of Vishńu, from *a*, privative, and chyuta, fallen; according to
our comment, 'he who does not perish with created things.' The
Mahábhárata interprets it in one place to mean, 'he who is not distinct
from final emancipation;' and in another to signify, 'exempt from
decay'. A commentator on the Káśikhańd́a of the Skánda Puráńa explains
it, 'he who never declines (or varies) from his own proper nature.'

<span id="fn_119"></span>[8:6](vp036.htm#fr_119.md) This is another common
title of Vishńu, implying supreme, best (Uttama), spirit (Purusha), or
male, or sacrifice, or, according to the Mahábh. Moksha Dharma, whatever
sense Purusha may bear.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[8:7](vp036.htm#fr_120.md) Paramárthatas, 'by or
through the real object, or sense; through actual truth.'

<span id="fn_121"></span>[8:8](vp036.htm#fr_121.md) Bhránti derśanatas,
'false appearances,' in opposition to actual truth. 'By the nature of
visible objects': Artha is explained by driśya, 'visible;' swarúpena 'by
the nature of:' that is, visible objects are not what they seem to be,
independent existences; they are essentially one with their original
source: and knowledge of their true nature or relation to Vishńu, is
knowledge of Vishńu himself. This is not the doctrine of Máyá, or the
influence of illusion, <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> which alone,
according to Vedánta idealism, constitutes belief in the existence of
matter: a doctrine foreign to most of the Puráńas, and first introduced
amongst them apparently by the Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[9:9](vp036.htm#fr_122.md) A different and more
detailed account of the transmission of the Vishńu Puráńa is given in
the last book, c. 8.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[9:10](vp036.htm#fr_123.md) The ordinary
derivation of Vásudeva has been noticed above ([p.
1](vp035.htm#page_1).md): here it is derived from Vas, 'to dwell,' from
Vishńu's abiding in all things, and all in him. The Mahábhárata explains
Vásu in the same manner, and Deva to signify radiant, shining: 'He
causes all things to dwell in him, and he abides in all; whence he is
named Vásu: being resplendent as the sun, he is called Deva: and he who
is both these, is denominated Vásudeva.' See also b. VI. c. 5.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[9:11](vp036.htm#fr_124.md) The commentator argues
that Vásudeva must be the Brahma, or supreme being, of the Vedas,
because the same circumstances are predicated of both, as eternity,
omnipresence, omnipotence, &c.; but he does not adduce any scriptural
text with the name Vásudeva.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[9:12](vp036.htm#fr_125.md) Time is not usually
enumerated in the Puráńas as an element of the first cause, but the
Padma P. and the Bhágavata <span id="page_10">p. 10</span> agree with
the Vishńu in including it. It appears to have been regarded at an
earlier date as an independent cause: the commentator on the Moksha
Dherma cites a passage from the Vedas, which he understands to allude to
the different theories of the cause of creation. Time, inherent nature,
consequence of acts, self-will, elementary atoms, matter, and spirit,
asserted severally by the Astrologers, the Buddhists, the Mimánsakas,
the Jains, the Logicians, the Sánkhyas, and the Vedántis. Κρόνος was
also one of the first generated agents in creation, according to the
Orphic theogony.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[10:13](vp036.htm#fr_126.md) The creation of the
world is very commonly considered to be the Lilá, sport or amusement, of
the Supreme Being.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[10:14](vp036.htm#fr_127.md) The attributes of
Pradhána, the chief (principle or element), here specified, conform
generally to those ascribed to it by the Sánkhya philosophy (Sánkhya
Káriká, p. 16, &c.), although some of them are incompatible with its
origin from a first cause. In the Sánkhya this incongruity does not
occur; for there Pradhána is independent, and coordinate with primary
spirit. The Puráńas give rise to the inconsistency by a lax use of both
philosophical and pantheistical expressions. The most incongruous
epithets in our text are however explained away in the comment. Thus
nitya, 'eternal,' is said to mean 'uniform, not liable to increase or
diminution:' Sadasadátmaka, 'comprehending what is and what is not,'
means 'having the power of both cause and effect', as proceeding from
Vishńu, and as giving origin to material things. Anádi, 'without
beginning,' means 'without birth', not being engendered by any created
thing, but proceeding immediately from the first cause. 'The mother,' or
literally the womb of the world', means the passive agent in creation,'
operated on or influenced by the active will of the Creator. The first
part of the passage in the text is a favourite one with several of. the
Puráńas, but they modify it and apply it after their own fashion. In the
Vishńu the original is \#\#\#, rendered as above. The Váyu, Brahmánda,
and <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> Kúrmma Puráńas have 'The indiscrete
cause, which is uniform, and both cause and effect, and whom those who
are acquainted with first principles call Pradhána and Prakriti--is the
uncognizable Brahma, who was before all.' But the application of two
synonymes of Prakriti to Brahma seems unnecessary at least. The Brahmá
P. corrects the reading apparently: the first line is as before; the
second is, \#\#\#. The passage is placed absolutely; 'There was an
indiscrete cause eternal, and cause and effect, which was both matter
and spirit (Pradhána and Purusha), from which this world was made.
Instead of 'such' or this,' some copies read 'from which Íśwara or god
(the active deity or Brahmá) made the world.' The Hari Vanśa has the
same reading, except in the last term, which it makes \#\#\# that is,
according to the commentator, the world, which is Íśwara, was made.' The
same authority explains this indiscrete cause, avyakta kárana, to denote
Brahmá, the creator an identification very unusual, if not inaccurate,
and possibly founded on misapprehension of what is stated by the
Bhavishya P.: 'That male or spirit which is endowed with that which is
the indiscrete cause, &c. is known in the world as Brahmá: he being in
the egg, &c.' The passage is precisely the same in Manu, I, 11; except
that we have 'visrishta' instead of 'viśisht́ha:' the latter is a
questionable reading, and is probably wrong: the sense of the latter is,
detached; and the whole means very consistently, 'embodied spirit
detached from the indiscrete cause of the world is known as Brahmá.' The
Padma P. inserts the first line, \#\#\# &c., but has 'Which creates
undoubtedly Mahat and the other qualities' assigning the first epithets,
therefore, as the Vishńu does, to Prakriti only. The Linga also refers
the expression to Prakriti alone, but makes it a secondary cause: 'An
indiscrete cause, which those acquainted with first principles call
Pradhána and Prakriti, proceeded from that Íśwara (Śiva).' This passage
is one of very many instances in which expressions are common to several
Puráńas that seem to be borrowed from one another, or from some common
source older than any of them, especially in this instance, as the same
text occurs in Manu.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[11:15](vp036.htm#fr_128.md) The expression of the
text is rather obscure; 'All was pervaded (or comprehended) by that
chief principle before (recreation), after the (last) destruction.' The
ellipses are filled up by the commentator. This, he adds, is to be
regarded as the state of things at a Mahá Pralaya, or total dissolution;
leaving, therefore, crude matter, nature, or chaos, as a coexistent
element with the Supreme. This, which is conformable to the
philosophical doctrine, is not however that of the Puráńas in general,
nor <span id="page_12">p. 12</span> that of our text, which states (b.
VI. c. 4), that at a Prákrita, or elementary dissolution, Pradhána
itself merges into the deity. Neither is it apparently the doctrine of
the Vedas, although their language is somewhat equivocal.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[12:16](vp036.htm#fr_129.md) The metre here is one
common to the Vedas, Trishtubh, but in other respects the language is
not characteristic of those compositions. The purport of the passage is
rendered somewhat doubtful by its close, and by the explanation of the
commentator. The former is, 'One Pradhánika Brahma Spirit: THAT, was.
The commentator explains Pradhánika, Pradhána eva, the same word as
Pradhána; but it is a derivative word, which may be used attributively,
implying 'having, or conjoined with, Pradhána.' The commentator,
however, interprets it as the substantive; for he adds, 'There was
Pradhána and Brahma and Spirit; this triad was at the period of
dissolution.' He evidently, however, understands their conjoint
existence as one only; for he continues, 'So, according to the Vedas,
then there was neither the existent (invisible cause, or matter) nor the
non-existent (visible effect, or creation),' meaning that there was only
One Being, in whom matter and its modifications were all comprehended.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[12:17](vp036.htm#fr_130.md) Or it might be
rendered, 'Those two other forms (which proceed) from his supreme
nature;' that is, from the nature of Vishńu, when he is Nirupádhi, or
without adventitious attributes: \#\#\# 'other' (\#\#\#); the
commentator states they are other or separate from Vishńu only through
Máyá, illusion,' but here implying false notion;' the elements of
creation being in essence one with Vishńu, though in existence detached
and different.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[12:18](vp036.htm#fr_131.md) Pradhána, when
unmodified, is, according to the Sánkhyas and Pauráńics, nothing more
than the three qualities in equilibrio, or goodness, foulness, and
darkness neutralising each other; (Sánkhya <span id="page_13">p.
13</span> Káriká, p. 52;) so in the Matsya P.: \#\#\#. This state is
synonymous with the non-evolution of material products, or with
dissolution; implying, however, separate existence, and detached from
spirit This being the case, it is asked who. should sustain matter and
spirit whilst separate, or renew their combination so as to renovate
creation? It is answered, Time, which is when every thing else is not;
and which, at the end of a certain interval, unites Matter, Pradhána,
and Purusha, and produces creation. Conceptions of this kind are
evidently comprised in the Orphic triad, or the ancient notion of the
cooperation of three such principles in creation; as Phanes or Eros,
which is the Hindu spirit or Purusha; Chaos, matter or Pradhána; and
Chronos, or Kála, time.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[13:19](vp036.htm#fr_132.md) Pradhána is styled
Vyaya 'that which may be expended;' or Parińámin, 'which may be
modified:' and Purusha is called Avyaya, 'inconsumable; or apariná.min,
'immutable.' The expressions 'having entered into,' and 'agitated,'
recall the mode in which divine intelligence, mens, νοῦς, was conceived
by the ancients to operate upon matter:

Φρὴν . . . φροντίσι κόσμον ἃπαντα  
. . . . καταΐσσουσα θόησιν:

or as in a more familiar passage;

Spiritus intus alit totamque infusa per artus  
Mens agitat molem et magno se corpore miscet:

or perhaps it more closely approximates to the Phœnician cosmogony, in
which a spirit mixing with its own principles gives rise to creation.
Brucker, I. 240. As presently explained, the mixture is not mechanical;
it is an influence or effect exerted upon intermediate agents, which
produce effects; as perfumes do not delight the mind by actual contact,
but by the impression they make upon the sense of smelling, which
communicates it to the mind. The entrance of the supreme Vishńu into
spirit as well as matter is less intelligible than the view elsewhere
taken of it, as the infusion of spirit, identified with the Supreme,
into Prakriti or matter alone. Thus in the Padma Puráńa: 'He who is
called the male (spirit) of Prakriti, is here named Achyuta; and that
same divine Vishńu entered into Prakriti.' So the Vrihat Naradiya: 'The
lord of the world, who is called Purusha, producing agitation in
Prakriti.' From the notion of influence or agitation produced on matter
through or with spirit, the abuse of personification led to actual or
vicarious admixture. Thus the Bhágavata, identifying Máyá with Prakriti,
has, <span id="page_14">p. 14</span> 'Through the operation of time, the
Mighty One, who is present to the pure, implanted a seed in Máyá endowed
with qualities, as Purusha, which is one with himself.' B. III. s.5. And
the Bhavishya: 'Some learned men say, that the Supreme Being, desirous
to create beings, creates in the commencement of the Kalpa a body of
soul (or an incorporeal substance); which soul created by him enters
into Prakriti; and Prakriti being thereby agitated, creates many
material elements.' But these may be regarded as notions of a later
date. In the Mahábhárata the first cause is declared to be
'Intellectual,' who creates by his mind or will: The first (Being) is
called Mánasa (intellectual), and is so celebrated by great sages: he is
God, without beginning or end, indivisible, immortal, undecaying.' And
again: 'The Intellectual created many kinds of creatures by his mind.'

<span id="fn_133"></span>[14:20](vp036.htm#fr_133.md) Contraction,
Sankocha, is explained by Sámya, sameness or equilibrium of the three
qualities, or inert Pradhána: and Expansion, Vikáśa, is the destruction
of this equipoise, by previous agitation and consequent developement of
material products.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[14:21](vp036.htm#fr_134.md) The term here is
Kshetrajna, 'embodied spirit,' or that which knows the kshetra or
'body;' implying the combination of spirit with form or matter, for the
purpose of creating.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[14:22](vp036.htm#fr_135.md) The first product of
Pradhána sensible to divine, though not to mere human organs, is, both
according to the Sánkhya and Pauráńic doctrines, the principle called
Mahat, literally 'the Great,' explained in other places, as in our text,
'the production of the manifestation of the qualities:' or, as in the
Váyu, \#\#\#. We have in the same Puráńa, as well as in the Brahmáńd́a
and Linga, a number of synonymes for this term, as, \#\#\#. They are
also explained, though not very distinctly, to the following purport:
"Manas is that which considers the consequences of acts to all
creatures, and provides for their happiness. Mahat, the Great principle,
is so termed from being the first of the created principles, and from
its extension being greater than that of the rest. Mati is that which
discriminates and distinguishes objects preparatory to their fruition by
Soul. Brahmá implies that which effects the developement and
augmentation of created things. Pur <span id="page_15">p. 15</span> is
that by which the concurrence of nature occupies and fills all bodies.
Buddhi is that which communicates to soul the knowledge of good and
evil. Khyáti is the means of individual fruition, or the faculty of
discriminating objects by appropriate designations, and the like. Íśwara
is that which knows all things as if they were present. Prajná is that
by which the properties of things are known. Chiti is that by which the
consequences of acts and species of knowledge are selected for the use
of soul. Smriti is the faculty of recognising all things, past, present,
or to come. Samvit is that in which all things are found or known, and
which is found or known in all things: and Vipura is that which is free
from the effects of contrarieties, as of knowledge and ignorance, and
the like. Mahat is also called Íśwara, from its exercising supremacy
over all things; Bháva, from its elementary existence; Eka, or 'the
one,' from its singleness; Purusha, from its abiding within the body;
and from its being ungenerated it is called Swayambhu." Now in this
nomenclature we have chiefly two sets of words; one, as Manas, Buddhi,
Mati, signifying mind, intelligence, knowledge, wisdom, design; and the
other, as Brahmá, Íśwara, &c., denoting an active creator and ruler of
the universe: as the Váyu adds, 'Mahat, impelled by the desire to
create, causes various creation:' and the Mahábhárata has, 'Mahat
created Ahankára.' The Puráńas generally employ the same expression,
attributing to Mahat or Intelligence the 'act of creating. Mahat is
therefore the divine mind in creative operation, the νοῦς ὁ διακόσμων τε
καὶ πάντων ἀίτιος of Anaxagoras; an ordering and disposing mind, which
was the cause of all things: The word itself suggests some relationship
to the Phœnician Mot, which, like Mahat, was the first product of the
mixture of spirit and matter, and the first rudiment of creation: "Ex
connexione autem ejus spiritus prodiit mot . . . hinc seminium omnis
creaturæ et omnium rerum creatio." Brucker, I. 240. Mot, it is true, .
appears to be a purely material substance, whilst Mahat is an
incorporeal substance; but they agree in their place in the cosmogony,
and are something alike in name. How far also the Phœnician system has
been accurately described, is matter of uncertainty. See Sánkhya Káriká,
p. 83.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[15:23](vp036.htm#fr_136.md) The sense of Ahankára
cannot be very well rendered by any European term. It means the
principle of individual existence, that which appropriates perceptions,
and on which depend the notions, I think, I feel, I am. It might be
expressed by the proposition of Descartes reversed; "Sum, ergo cogito,
sentio," &c. The equivalent employed by Mr. Colebrooke, egotism, has the
advantage of an analogous etymology, Ahankára being derived from Aham,
'I;' as in the Hari Vanśa: 'He (Brahmá), oh Bhárata, said, *I* will
create creatures.' See also S. Káriká, p. 91.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[16:24](vp036.htm#fr_137.md) These three varieties
of Ahankára are also described in the Sánkhya Káriká, p. 92. Vaikárika,
that which is productive, or susceptible of production, is the same as
the Sátwika, or that which is combined with the property of goodness.
Taijasa Ahankára is that which is endowed with Tejas, heat' or energy,'
in [consequence](errata.htm#1.md) of its having the property of Rajas,
'passion' or 'activity;' and the third kind, Bhútádi, or 'elementary,'
is the Támasa, or has the property of darkness. From the first kind
proceed the senses; from the last, the rudimental unconscious elements;
both kinds, which are equally of themselves inert, being rendered
productive by the cooperation of the second, the energetic or active
modification of Ahankára, which is therefore said to be the origin of
both the senses and the elements.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[16:25](vp036.htm#fr_138.md) The successive series
of rudiments and elements, and their respectively engendering the
rudiments and elements next in order, occur in most of the Puráńas, in
nearly the same words. The Vrihannáradiya P. observes, 'They (the
elements) in successive order acquire the property of causality one to
the other.' The order is also the same; or, ether (ákás), wind or air
(váyu), fire or light (tejas), water and earth; except in one passage of
the Mahábhárata (Moksha Dherma, C. 9), where it is ether, water, fire,
air, earth. The order of Empedocles was ether, fire, earth, water, air.
Cudworth, I. 97. The investment (ávarańa) of each element by its own
rudiment, and of each rudiment by its preceding gross and rudimental
elements, is also met with in most of the chief Puráńas, as the Váyu,
Padma, Linga, and Bhágavata; and traces <span id="page_17">p. 17</span>
of it are found amongst the ancient cosmogonists; for Anaximander
supposed, that when the world was made, a certain sphere or flame of
fire, separated from matter (the Infinite), encompassed the air, which
invested the earth as the bark does a tree:' Κατὰ τὴν γένεσιν τοῦδε τοῦ
κόσμου ἀποκριθῆναι, καί τινα ἑκ τούτου φλογὸς σπαῖραν περιφυῆναι τῷ περὶ
τὴν γῆν ἄερι, ὡς τῷ δένδρῳ φλοιόν. Euseb. Pr, I. 15. Some of the
Puráńas, as the Matsya, Váyu, Linga, Bhágavata, and Márkańd́eya, add a
description of a participation of properties amongst the elements, which
is rather Vedánta than Sánkhya. According to this notion, the elements
add to their characteristic properties those of the elements which
precede them. Ákas has the single property of sound: air has those of
touch and sound: fire has colour, touch, and sound: water has taste,
colour, touch, and sound: and earth has smell and the rest, thus having
five properties: or, as the Linga P. describes the series, \#\#\#.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[17:26](vp036.htm#fr_139.md) Tanmátra, 'rudiment'
or 'type,' from Tad, 'that,' for Tasmin, 'in that' gross element, and
mátrá, 'subtile or rudimental form'. The rudiments are also the
characteristic properties of the elements: as the Bhágavata; 'The
rudiment of it (ether) is also its quality, sound; as a common
designation may denote both a person who sees an object, and the object
which is to be seen: that is, according to the commentator, suppose a
person behind a wall called aloud, "An elephant! an elephant!" the term
would equally indicate that an elephant was visible, and that somebody
saw it. Bhag. II. 5.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[17:27](vp036.htm#fr_140.md) The properties here
alluded to are not those of goodness &c., but other properties assigned
to perceptible objects by the Sánkhya doctrines, or Śánti, 'placidity;'
Ghoratá, 'terror;' and Moha, 'dulness' or 'stupefaction.' S. Káriká,
V.38. p, 119.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[17:28](vp036.htm#fr_141.md) The Bhágavata, which
gives a similar statement of the origin of the elements, senses, and
divinities, specifies the last to be Diś (space), air, the sun,
Prachetas, the Aswins, fire, Indra, Upendra, Mitra, and Ka or Prajápati,
presiding over the senses, according to the comment, or severally over
the ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose, speech, hands, feet, and excretory and
generative organs. Bhag. II. 5. 31.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[18:29](vp036.htm#fr_142.md) Avyaktánugraheńa. The
expression is something equivocal, as Avyakta may here apply either to
the First Cause or to matter. In either case the notion is the same, and
the aggregation of the elements is the effect of the presidence of
spirit, without any active interference of the indiscrete principle. The
Avyakta is passive in the evolution and combination of Mahat and the
rest. Pradhána is, no doubt, intended, but its identification with the
Supreme is also implied. The term Anugraha may also refer to a
classification of the order of creation, which will be again adverted
to.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[18:30](vp036.htm#fr_143.md) It is impossible not
to refer this notion to the same origin as the widely diffused opinion
of antiquity, of the first manifestation of the world in the form of an
egg. "It seems to have been a favourite symbol, and very ancient, and we
find it adopted among many nations." Bryant, III. 165. Traces of it
occur amongst the Syrians, Persians, and Egyptians; and besides the
Orphic egg amongst the Greeks, and that described by Aristophanes,
Τέκτεν πρώτιστον ὑπηνέμιον νὺξ ἡ μελανόπτερος ὠόν part of the ceremony
in the Dionysiaca and other mysteries consisted of the consecration of
an egg; by which, according to Porphyry, was signified the world:
Ἑρμηνεὺει δὲ τὸ ὠὸν τὸν κόσμον. Whether this egg typified the ark, as
Bryant and Faber suppose, is not material to the proof of the antiquity
and wide diffusion of the belief that the world in the beginning existed
in such a figure. A similar account of the first aggregation of the
elements in the form of an egg is given in all the Puráńas, with the
usual epithet Haima or Hiranya, 'golden,' as it occurs in Manu, I. 9.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[19:31](vp036.htm#fr_144.md) Here is another
analogy to the doctrines of antiquity relating to the mundane egg: and
as the first visible male being, who, as we shall hereafter see, united
in himself the nature of either sex, abode in the egg, and issued from
it; so "this firstborn of the world, whom they represented under two
shapes and characters, and who sprung from the mundane egg, was the
person from whom the mortals and immortals were derived. He was the same
as Dionusus, whom they styled, πρωτόγονον διφνῆ τρίγονον Βακχεῖον Ἄνακτα
Ἄγριον ἀρρητὸν κρύφιον δικέρωτα δίμοφον:" or, with the omission of one
epithet, , \#\#\#.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[19:32](vp036.htm#fr_145.md) Janárddana is derived
from Jana, 'men,' and Arddana, 'worship;' 'the object of adoration to
mankind.'

<span id="fn_146"></span>[19:33](vp036.htm#fr_146.md) This is the
invariable doctrine of the Puráńas, diversified only according to the
<span id="page_20">p. 20</span> individual divinity to whom they ascribe
identity with Paramátmá or Parameśwara. In our text this is Vishńu: in
the Śaiva Puráńas, as in the Linga, it is Śiva: in the Brahma-vaivartta
it is Krishńa. The identification of one of the hypostases with the
common source of the triad was an incongruity not unknown to other
theogonies; for Cneph, amongst the Egyptians, appears on the one hand to
have been identified with the Supreme Being, the indivisible unity,
whilst on the other he is confounded with both Emeph and Ptha, the
second and third persons of the triad of hypostases. Cudworth, I. 4. 18.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[20:34](vp036.htm#fr_147.md) 'The world that is
termed spirit;' explained by the commentator, 'which indeed bears the
appellation spirit;' conformably to the text of the Vedas, 'this
universe is indeed spirit.' This is rather Vedánta than Sánkhya, and
appears to deny the existence of matter: and so it does as an
independent existence; for the origin and end of infinite substance is
the Deity or universal spirit: but it does not therefore imply the
non-existence of the world as real substance.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[20:35](vp036.htm#fr_148.md) Vishńu is both
Bhúteśa, 'lord of the elements,' or of created things, and Viśwarúpa,
'universal substance:' he is therefore, as one with sensible things,
subject to his own control.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[20:36](vp036.htm#fr_149.md) Vareńya, 'most
excellent;' being the same, according to the commentator, with supreme
felicity.
