2\. The Padma Puráńa

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

2\. Padma Puráńa. "That which contains an account of the period when the
world was a golden lotus (padma), and of all the occurrences of that
time, is therefore called the Pádma by the wise: it contains fifty-five
thousand stanzas <span id="fr_36"></span>[37](#fn_36)." The second
Puráńa in the usual lists is always the Pádma, a very voluminous work,
containing, according to its own statement, as well as that of other
authorities, fifty-five thousand slokas; an amount not far from the
truth. These are divided amongst five books, or Khańd́as; 1. the Srisht́i
Khańd́a, or section on creation; 2. the Bhúmi Khańd́a, description of the
earth; 3. the Swarga Khańd́a, chapter on heaven; 4. Pátála Khańd́a,
chapter on the regions below the earth; and 5. the Uttara Khańd́a, last
or supplementary chapter. There is also current a sixth division, the
Kriyá Yoga Sára, a treatise on the practice of devotion.

The denominations of these divisions of the Padma P. convey but an
imperfect and partial notion of their contents. In the first, or section
which treats of creation, the narrator is Ugraśravas the Súta, the son
of Lomaharshańa, who is sent by his father to the Rishis at
Naimisháráńya to communicate to them the Puráńa, which, from its
containing an account of the lotus (padma), in which Brahmá appeared at
creation, is termed the Pádma or Padma Puráńa. The Súta repeats what was
originally communicated by Brahmá to Pulastya, and by him to Bhíshma.
The early chapters narrate the cosmogony, and the genealogy of the
patriarchal families, much in the same style, and often in the same
words, as the Vishńu; and short accounts of the Manwantaras and regal
dynasties: but these, which are legitimate Pauráńik matters, soon make
way for new and unauthentic inventions, illustrative of the virtues of
the lake of Pushkara, or Pokher in Ajmir, as a place of pilgrimage.

The Bhúmi Khańd́a, or section of the earth, defers any description of the
earth until near its close, filling up one hundred and twenty-seven
chapters with legends of a very mixed description, some ancient and
common to other Puráńas, but the greater part peculiar to itself,
illustrative of Tírthas either figuratively so termed--as a wife, a
parent, or a

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Guru, considered
as a sacred object--or places to which actual pilgrimage should be
performed.

The Swarga Khańd́a describes in the first chapters the relative positions
of the Lokas or spheres above the earth, placing above all Vaikuńtha,
the sphere of Vishńu; an addition which is not warranted by what appears
to be the oldest cosmology <span id="fr_37"></span>[38](#fn_37).
Miscellaneous notices of some of the most celebrated princes then
succeed, conformably to the usual narratives; and these are followed by
rules of conduct for the several castes, and at different stages of
life. The rest of the book is occupied by legends of a diversified
description, introduced without much method or contrivance; a few of
which, as Daksha's sacrifice, are of ancient date, but of which the most
are original and modern.

The Pátála Khańd́a devotes a brief introduction to the description of
Pátála, the regions of the snake-gods; but the name of Ráma having been
mentioned, Śesha, who has succeeded Pulastya as spokesman, proceeds to
narrate the history of Ráma, his descent and his posterity; in which the
compiler seems to have taken the poem of Kálidaśa, the Raghu Vanśa, for
his chief authority. An originality of addition may be suspected,
however, in the adventures of the horse destined by Ráma for an
Aśwamedha, which form the subject of a great many chapters. When about
to be sacrificed, the horse turns out to be a Brahman, condemned by an
imprecation of Durvásas, a sage, to assume the equine nature, and who,
by having been sanctified by connexion with Ráma, is released from his
metamorphosis, and dispatched as a spirit of light to heaven. This piece
of Vaishńava fiction is followed by praises of the Śrí Bhágavata, an
account of Krishńa's juvenilities, and the merits of worshipping Vishńu.
These accounts are communicated through a machinery borrowed from the
Tantras: they are told by Sadáśiva to Párvati, the ordinary
interlocutors of Tántrika compositions.

The Uttara Khańd́a is a most voluminous aggregation of very heterogeneous
matters, but it is consistent in adopting a decidedly Vaishńava tone,
and admitting no compromise with any other form of faith. The chief
subjects are first discussed in a dialogue between king Dilípa and

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

the Muni Vaśisht́ha; such as the merits of bathing in the month of Mágha,
and the potency of the Mantra or prayer addressed to Lakshmí Náráyańa.
But the nature of Bhakti, faith in Vishńu--the use of Vaishńava marks on
the body--the legends of Vishńu's Avatáras, and especially of Ráma--and
the construction of images of Vishńu--are too important to be left to
mortal discretion: they are explained by Śiva to Párvati, and wound up
by the adoration of Vishńu by those divinities. The dialogue then
reverts to the king and the sage; and the latter states why Vishńu is
the only one of the triad entitled to respect; Śiva being licentious,
Brahmá arrogant, and Vishńu alone pure. Vaśisht́ha then repeats, after
Śiva, the Máhátmya of the Bhagavad Gítá; the merit of each book of which
is illustrated by legends of the good consequences to individuals from
perusing or hearing it. Other Vaishńava Máhátmyas occupy considerable
portions of this Khańd́a, especially the Kártíka Máhátmya, or holiness of
the month Kartika, illustrated as usual by stories, a few of which are
of an early origin, but the greater part modern, and peculiar to this
Puráńa <span id="fr_38"></span>[39](#fn_38).

The Kriyá Yoga Sára is repeated by Súta to the Rishis, after Vyása's
communication of it to Jaimini, in answer to an inquiry how religious
merit might be secured in the Kálí age, in which men have become
incapable of the penances and abstraction by which final liberation was
formerly to be attained. The answer is, of course, that which is
intimated in the last hook of the Vishńu Puráńa--personal devotion to
Vishńu: thinking of him, repeating his names, wearing his marks,
worshipping in his temples, are a full substitute for all other acts of
moral or devotional or contemplative merit.

The different portions of the Padma Puráńa are in all probability as
many different works, neither of which approaches to the original
definition of a Puráńa. There may be some connexion between the three
first portions, at least as to time; but there is no reason to consider
them as of high antiquity. They specify the Jains both by name and
practices.; they talk of Mlechchhas, 'barbarians,' flourishing in India;
they commend

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

the use of the frontal and other Vaishńava marks; and they notice other
subjects which, like these, are of no remote origin. The Pátála Khańd́a
dwells copiously upon the Bhágavata, and is consequently posterior to
it. The Uttara Khańd́a is intolerantly Vaishńava, and is therefore
unquestionably modern. It enjoins the veneration of the Sálágram stone
and Tulasí plant, the use of the Tapta-mudra, or stamping with a hot
iron the name of Vishńu on the skin, and a variety of practices and
observances undoubtedly no part of the original system. It speaks of the
shrines of Śrí-rangam and Venkatádri in the Dekhin, temples that have no
pretension to remote antiquity; and it names Haripur on the Tungabhadra,
which is in all likelihood the city of Vijayanagar, founded in the
middle of the fourteenth century. The Kriyá Yoga Sára is equally a
modern, and apparently a Bengali composition. No portion of the Padma
Puráńa is probably older than the twelfth century, and the last parts
may be as recent as the fifteenth or sixteenth <span
