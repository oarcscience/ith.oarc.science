### CHAP. V.

Kings of Mithilá. Legend of Nimi, the son of Ikshwáku. Birth of Janaka.
Sacrifice of Síradhwaja. Origin of Sítá. Descendants of Kuśadhwaja.
Kriti the last of the Maithila princes.

THE son of Ikshwáku, who was named Nimi <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[1](#fn_1020), instituted a sacrifice that was to
endure for a thousand years, and applied to Vaśisht́ha to offer the
oblations. Vaśisht́ha in answer said, that he had been preengaged by
Indra for five hundred years, but that if the Rájá, would wait for some
time, he would come and officiate as superintending priest. The king
made no answer, and Vaśisht́ha went away, supposing that he had assented.
When the sage had completed the performance of the ceremonies he had
conducted for Indra, he returned with all speed to Nimi, purposing to
render him the like office. When he arrived, however, and found that
Nimi had retained Gautama and other priests to minister at his
sacrifice, he was much displeased, and pronounced upon the king, who was
then asleep, a curse to this effect, that since he had not intimated his
intention, but transferred to Gautama the duty he had first entrusted to
himself, Vaśisht́ha, Nimi should thenceforth cease to exist in a
corporeal form. When Nimi woke, and knew what had happened, he in return
denounced as an imprecation upon his unjust preceptor, that he also
should lose his bodily existence, as the punishment of uttering a curse
upon him without previously communicating with him. Nimi then abandoned
his bodily condition. The spirit of Vaśisht́ha also leaving his body, was
united with the spirits of Mitra and Varuńa for a season, until, through
their passion for the nymph Urvaśí, the sage was born again in a
different shape. The corpse of Nimi was preserved from decay by being
embalmed with fragrant oils and resins, and it remained as entire as if
it were immortal <span id="fr_1021"></span>[2](#fn_1021). When the
sacrifice

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

was concluded, the priests applied to the gods, who had come to receive
their portions, that they would confer a blessing upon the author of the
sacrifice. The gods were willing to restore him to bodily life, but Nimi
declined its acceptance, saying, "O deities, who are the alleviators of
all worldly suffering, there is not in the world a deeper cause of
distress than the separation of soul and body: it is therefore my wish
to dwell in the eyes of all beings, but never more to resume a corporeal
shape!" To this desire the gods assented, and Nimi was placed by them in
the eyes of all living creatures; in consequence of which their eyelids
are ever opening and shutting.

As Nimi left no successor, the Munis, apprehensive of the consequences
of the earth being without a ruler, agitated the body of the prince, and
produced from it a prince who was called Janaka, from being born without
a progenitor. In consequence of his father being without a body
(videha), he was termed also Vaideha, 'the son of the bodiless;' and the
further received the name of Mithi, from having been produced by
agitation (mathana) <span id="fr_1022"></span>[3](#fn_1022). The son of
Janaka was Udávasu;

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

his son was Nandivarddhana; his son was Suketu; his son was Devaráta;
his son was Vrihaduktha; his son was Mahávírya; his son was Satyadhriti;
his son was Dhrisht́aketu; his son was Haryyaśwa; his son was Maru; his
son was Pratibandhaka; his son was Kritaratha; his son was Krita; his
son was Vibudha; his son was Mahádhriti; his son was Kritiráta; his son
was Mahároman; his son was Suvarńaroman; his son was Hraswaroman; his
son was Síradhwaja.

Síradhwaja ploughing the ground, to prepare it for a sacrifice which he
instituted in order to obtain progeny, there sprang up in the furrow a
damsel, who became his daughter Sítá <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[4](#fn_1023). The brother of Síradhwaja was
Kuśadhwaja, who was king of Káśí <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[5](#fn_1024); he had a son also, named
Bhánumat <span id="fr_1025"></span>[6](#fn_1025). The son of Bhánumat
was Satadyumna; his son was Śuchi; his son was Úrjjaváha; his son was
Śatyadhwaja; his son was Kuni <span id="fr_1026"></span>[7](#fn_1026);
his son was Anjana; his son was Ritujit; his son was Arisht́anemi <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[8](#fn_1027); his son was Śrutáyus; his son was
Supárśwa; his son was Sanjaya <span id="fr_1028"></span>[9](#fn_1028);
his son was Kshemári <span id="fr_1029"></span>[10](#fn_1029); his son
was Anenas <span id="fr_1030"></span>[11](#fn_1030); his son was
Mínaratha <span id="fr_1031"></span>[12](#fn_1031); his son was
Satyaratha; his son was Sátyarathi <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[13](#fn_1032); his son was Upagu <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[14](#fn_1033); his son was Śruta <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[15](#fn_1034); his son was Sáswata <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[16](#fn_1035); his son was Sudhanwan; his son was
Subhása; his son was Suśruta <span id="fr_1036"></span>[17](#fn_1036);
his son was Jaya; his son was Vijaya; his son was Rita; his son was
Sunaya <span id="fr_1037"></span>[18](#fn_1037); his son was Vítahavya;

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

his son was Dhriti; his son was Bahuláśwa; his son was Kriti, with whom
terminated the family of Janaka. These are the kings of Mithilá, who for
the most part will be <span id="fr_1038"></span>[19](#fn_1038)
proficient in spiritual knowledge <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[20](#fn_1039).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[388:1](vp097.htm#fr_1020) None of the
authorities, except the Váyu and Bhágavata, contain the series of kings
noticed in this chapter.

<span id="fn_1021"></span>[388:2](vp097.htm#fr_1021) This shews that the
Hindus were not unacquainted with the Egyptian art of embalming dead
bodies. In the Káśí Khańd́a, s. 30, an account is given of a Brahman who
carries his mother's bones, <span id="page_389">p. 389</span> or rather
her corpse, from Setuhandha or Rámeśwara to Káśí. For this purpose he
first washes it with the five excretions of a cow, and the five pure
fluids, or milk, curds, ghee, honey, and sugar. He then embalms it with
Yakshakarddama, a composition of Agallochum, camphor, musk, saffron,
sandal, and a resin called Kakkola; and envelopes it severally with
Netra vastra, flowered muslin; Pat́t́amvara, silk; Surasa vastra, coarse
cotton; Mánjisht́ha, cloth dyed with madder; and Nepala Kambala, nepal
blanketing. He then covers it with pure clay, and puts the whole into a
coffin of copper, Támra samput́a. These practices are not only unknown,
but would be thought impure in the present day.

<span id="fn_1022"></span>[389:3](vp097.htm#fr_1022) These legends are
intended to explain, and were probably suggested by, the terms Vaideha
and Mithilá, applied to the country upon the Gandak and Kai rivers, the
modern Tirhut. The Rámáyańa places a prince named Mithi between Nimi and
Janaka, whence comes the name Mithilá. In other respects the list of
kings of Mithilá agrees, except in a few names. Janaka the successor of
Nimi is different from Janaka who is celebrated as the father of Síta.
One of them, which, does not appear, is also renowned as a philosopher,
and patron of philosophical teachers. Mahábhárata, Moksha Dharma.
According to the Váyu P., Nimi founded a city called Jayantapur, near
the Áśrama of Gautama. The remains of a city called Janakpur, on the
northern skirts of the district, are supposed to indicate the site of a
city founded by one of the princes so named.

<span id="fn_1023"></span>[390:4](vp097.htm#fr_1023) This identifies
Síradhwaja with the second Janaka, the father-in-law of Ráma. The story
of Sítá's birth, or rather discovery, is narrated in the Aránya Khańd́a
of the Rámáyańa, the Vana Parva of the Mahábhárata, and in the Váyu,
Brahma Vaivartta, Káliká, and other Puráńas.

<span id="fn_1024"></span>[390:5](vp097.htm#fr_1024) The Rámáyańa says,
'of Sankaśya,' which is no doubt the correct reading. Fa Hian found the
kingdom of Sang-kia-shi in the Doab, about Mainpuri. Account of the
Foe-kuë-ki. The Bhágavata makes Kuśadhwaja the son of Síradwaja.

<span id="fn_1025"></span>[390:6](vp097.htm#fr_1025) The Bhágavata
differs from our authority here considerably, by inserting several
princes between Kúsadhwaja and Bhánumat; or, Dharmadhwaja, who has two
sons, Kritadhwaja and Kháńd́ikya; the former is the father of Keśidhwaja,
the latter of Bhánumat. See the last book of the Vishńu.

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[390:7](vp097.htm#fr_1026) Śakuni, and the
last of the series, according to the Váyu,

<span id="fn_1027"></span>[390:8](vp097.htm#fr_1027) Between this prince
and Śuchi the series of the Bhágavata is Sanadhwaja, Urddhwaketu, Aja,
Purujit. The following variations are from the same authority.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[390:9](vp097.htm#fr_1028) Chitraratha.

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[390:10](vp097.htm#fr_1029) Kshemadhí.

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[390:11](vp097.htm#fr_1030) Omitted.

<span id="fn_1031"></span>[390:12](vp097.htm#fr_1031) Samaratha.

<span id="fn_1032"></span>[390:13](vp097.htm#fr_1032) Omitted.

<span id="fn_1033"></span>[390:14](vp097.htm#fr_1033) Upaguru.

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[390:15](vp097.htm#fr_1034) Upagupta.

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[390:16](vp097.htm#fr_1035) Vaswananta.

<span id="fn_1036"></span>[390:17](vp097.htm#fr_1036) Yuyudhána,
Subháshańa, Śruta.

<span id="fn_1037"></span>[390:18](vp097.htm#fr_1037) Śunaka.

<span id="fn_1038"></span>[391:19](vp097.htm#fr_1038) \#\#\# is the
reading of all the copies; but why the future verb, 'will be,' is used
does not appear.

<span id="fn_1039"></span>[391:20](vp097.htm#fr_1039) Descendants of two
of the other sons of the Manu are noticed in the Bhágavata; from Nriga,
it is said, proceeded Sumati, Bhútajyotish, Vasu, Pratíka, Oghavat, and
his sister Oghavatí, married to Sudarśana. The Linga gives three sons to
Nriga, Vrisha, Dhrisht́aka, and Rańadhrisht́a, and alludes to a legend of
his having been changed to a lizard by the curse of a Brahman.
Narishyanta's descendants were Chitrasena, Daksha, Madhwat, Púrva,
Indrasena, Vítihotra, Satyaśrava, Uruśravas, Devadatta, Agniveśya, also
called Játukarńa, a form of Agni, and progenitor of the Ágniveśya
Brahmans. In the Bráhma P. and Hari V. the sons of Narishyat, whom the
commentator on the latter considers as the same with Narishyanta, are
termed Sacas, Sacæ or Scythians; whilst, again, it is said that the son
of Narishyanta was Dama, or, as differently read, Yams. As this latter
affiliation is stated in the authorities, it would appear as if this
Narishyanta was one of the sons of the Manu; but this is only a proof of
the carelessness of the compilation, for in the Vishńu, Váyu, and
Márkańd́eya Puráńas, Narishyanta, the father of Dama, is the son of
Marutta, the fourteenth of the posterity of Disht́a or Nedisht́a.
