### CHAP. XXVII.

Pradyumna stolen by Sambara; thrown into the sea, and swallowed by a
fish; found by Máyádeví: he kills Sambara, marries Máyádeví, and returns
with her to Dwáraká. Joy of Rukminí and Krishńa.

MAITREYA.--How, Muni, happened it that the hero Pradyumna was carried
away by Sambara? and in what manner was the mighty Sambara killed by
Pradyumna?

PARÁŚARA.--When Pradyumna was but six days old, he was stolen from the
lying-in chamber by Sambara, terrible as death; for the demon foreknew
that Pradyumna, if he lived, would be his destroyer. Taking away the
boy, Sambara cast him into the ocean, swarming with monsters, into a
whirlpool of roaring waves, the haunt of the huge creatures of the deep.
A large fish swallowed the child, but he died not, and was born anew
from its belly <span id="fr_1539"></span>[1](#fn_1539.md): for that fish,
with others, was caught by the fishermen, and delivered by them to the
great Asura Sambara. His wife Máyádeví, the mistress of his household,
superintended the operations of the cooks, and saw, when the fish was
cut open, a beautiful child, looking like a new shoot of the blighted
tree of love. Whilst wondering who this should be, and how he could have
got into the belly of the fish, Nárada came to satisfy her curiosity,
and said to the graceful dame, "This is the son of him by whom the whole
world is created and destroyed, the son of Vishńu, who was stolen by
Sambara from the lying-in chamber, and tossed by him into the sea, where
he was swallowed by the fish. He is now in thy power; do thou, beautiful
woman, tenderly rear this jewel of mankind." Thus counselled by Nárada,
Máyádeví took charge of the boy, and carefully reared him from
childhood, being fascinated by the beauty of his person. Her affection
became still more impassioned when he was decorated with the bloom of
adolescence. The gracefully-moving Máyávatí then, fixing her heart

<span id="page_576">p. 576</span>

and eyes upon the high-minded Pradyumna, gave him, whom she regarded as
herself, all her magic (and illusive) powers.

Observing these marks of passionate affection, the son of Krishńa said
to the lotus-eyed Máyádeví, "Why do you indulge in feelings so
unbecoming the character of a mother?" To which she replied, "Thou art
not a son of mine; thou art the son of Vishńu, whom Kálá Sambara carried
away, and threw into the sea: thou vast swallowed by a fish, but wast
rescued by me from its belly. Thy fond mother, O beloved, is still
weeping for thee." When the valiant Pradyumna heard this, he was filled
with wrath, and defied Sambara to battle. In the conflict that ensued,
the son of Mádhava slew the whole host of Sambara. Seven times he foiled
the delusions of the enchanter, and making himself master of the eighth,
turned it against Sambara, and killed him. By the same faculty he
ascended into the air, and proceeded to his father's house, where he
alighted, along with Máyávatí, in the inner apartments. When the women
beheld Pradyumna, they thought it was Krishńa himself. Rukminí, her eyes
dimmed with tears, spoke tenderly to him, and said, "Happy is she who
has a son like this, in the bloom of youth. Such would be the age of my
son Pradyumna, if he was alive. Who is the fortunate mother adorned by
thee? and yet from thy appearance, and from the affection I feel for
thee, thou art assuredly the son of Hari."

At this moment Krishńa, accompanied by Nárada, arrived; and the latter
said to the delighted Rukminí, "This is thine own son, who has come
hither after killing Sambara, by whom, when an infant, he was stolen
from the lying-in chamber. This is the virtuous Máyávatí, his wife, and
not the wife of Sambara. Hear the reason. When Manmatha, the deity of
love, had perished <span id="fr_1540"></span>[2](#fn_1540.md), the goddess
of beauty, desirous to secure

<span id="page_577">p. 577</span>

his revival, assumed a delusive form, and by her charms fascinated the
demon Sambara, and exhibited herself to him in various illusory
enjoyments. This thy son is the descended Káma; and this is the goddess
Ratí, his wife <span id="fr_1541"></span>[3](#fn_1541.md). There is no
occasion for any uncertainty: this is thy daughter-in-law." Then Rukminí
was glad, and Keśava also; the whole city resounded with exclamations of
joy, and all the people of Dwáraká were surprised at Rukminí's
recovering a son who had so long been lost.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1539"></span>[575:1](vp144.htm#fr_1539.md) The Bhágavata tells
the story in the same manner, but the Hari Vanśa omits the part of the
fish.

<span id="fn_1540"></span>[576:2](vp144.htm#fr_1540.md) When he was reduced
to ashes by a fiery glance from Śiva, in resentment of his inflaming him
with passion for Umá. This legend is a favourite with the Śaiva Puráńas,
and is told in the Linga and Káliká, also in the Padma P. and Káśí
Khańd́a of the Skánda P. They do not say much about his resuscitation
however; Śiva, in pity of Ratí's grief, restoring him only to a bodiless
existence as Ananga, whose place is to be in the hearts of men. The
Linga adds, that when Vishńu, in consequence of the curse of Bhrigu,
shall be born as the son of Vasudeva, Káma shall be born as one of his
sons.

<span id="fn_1541"></span>[577:3](vp144.htm#fr_1541.md) The daughter of
Daksha, but not enumerated amongst those formerly specified ([p.
54](vp041.htm#page_54).md): she was born from his perspiration, according
to the Káliká P.
