### CHAP. XVI.

Descendants of Turvasu.

PARÁŚARA.--I shall now summarily give you an account of the descendants
of Turvasu.

The son of Turvasu was Vahni <span id="fr_1184"></span>[1](#fn_1184);
his son was Gobánu <span id="fr_1185"></span>[2](#fn_1185); his son was
Traiśámba <span id="fr_1186"></span>[3](#fn_1186); his son was
Karandhama; his son was Marutta. Marutta had no children, and he
therefore adopted Dushyanta, of the family of Puru; by which the line of
Turvasu merged into that of Puru <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[4](#fn_1187). This took place in consequence of the
malediction denounced on his son by Yayáti <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[5](#fn_1188).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[442:1](vp109.htm#fr_1184) Varga: Agni.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[442:2](vp109.htm#fr_1185) Bhánumat:
Bhágavata, which also inserts Bhaga before him.

<span id="fn_1186"></span>[442:3](vp109.htm#fr_1186) Tribhánu: Váyu.
Triśánu: Bráhma. Traiśáli: Agni. Triśári: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1187"></span>[442:4](vp109.htm#fr_1187) Besides Bharata,
who, as will be hereafter seen, was the son of Dushyanta, the Váyu,
Matsya, Agni, and Bráhma Puráńas enumerate several descendants in this
line, for the purpose evidently of introducing, as the posterity of
Turvasu, the nations of the south of India: the series is Varuttha,
(Karutthama, Bráhma), Ándíra (Ákríra, Bráhma); whose sons are Páńd́ya,
Karńát́a, Chola, Kerala; the Hari V. adds Kola, and the Agni very
incorrectly Gandhára.

<span id="fn_1188"></span>[442:5](vp109.htm#fr_1188) The curse alluded
to is the failure of his line (Prajásamuchcheda), denounced upon Turvasu
as the punishment of refusing to take his father's infirmities upon him
(see [p. 414](vp103.htm#page_414)). He was also sentenced to rule over
savages and barbarians, Mlechchhas, or people not Hindus. The
Mahábhárata adds that the Yavanas sprang from Turvasu. As sovereign of
the southeast, he should be the ancestor of the people of Arracan, Ava,
&c.; but the authorities cited in the preceding note refer the nations
of the Peninsula to him, and consequently consider them as Mlechchhas.
Manu also places the Dráviras or Tamuls amongst Mlechchhas; and these
and similar passages indicate a period prior to the introduction of
Hinduism into the south of India.
