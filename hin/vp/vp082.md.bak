### CHAP. VIII.

How Vishńu is to be worshipped, as related by Aurva to Sagara. Duties of
the four castes, severally and in common: also in time of distress.

MAITREYA.--Inform me, venerable teacher, how the supreme deity, the lord
of the universe, Vishńu, is worshipped by those who are desirous of
overcoming the world; and what advantages are reaped by men, assiduous
in his adoration, from the propitiated Govinda.

PARÁŚARA.--The question you have asked was formerly put by Sagara to
Aurva <span id="fr_817"></span>[1](#fn_817.md). I will repeat to you his
reply.

Sagara having bowed down before Aurva, the descendant of Bhrigu, asked
him what were the best means of pleasing Vishńu, and what would be the
consequence of obtaining his favour. Aurva replied, "He who pleases
Vishńu obtains all terrestrial enjoyments; heaven and a place in heaven;
and what is best of all, final liberation: whatever he wishes, and to
whatever extent, whether much or little, he receives it, when Achyuta is
content with him. In what manner his favour is to be secured, that also
I will, oh king, impart to you, agreeably to your desire. The supreme
Vishńu is propitiated by a man who observes the institutions of caste,
order, and purificatory practices: no other path is the way to please
him. He who offers sacrifices, sacrifices to him; he who murmurs prayer,
prays to him; he who injures living creatures, injures him; for Hari is
all beings. Janárddana therefore is propitiated by him

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

who is attentive to established observances, and follows the duties
prescribed for his caste. The Brahman, the Kshatriya, the Vaiśya, and
the Śúdra, who attends to the rules enjoined his caste, best worships
Vishńu. Keśava is most pleased with him who does good to others; who
never utters abuse, calumny, or untruth; who never covets another's wife
or another's wealth, and who bears ill-will towards none; who neither
beats nor slays any animate or inanimate thing; who is ever diligent in
the service of the gods, of the. Brahmans, and of his spiritual
preceptor; who is always desirous of the welfare of all creatures, of
his children, and of his own soul; in whose pure heart no pleasure is
derived from the imperfections of love and hatred. The man, oh monarch,
who conforms to the duties enjoined by scriptural authority for every
caste and condition of life, is he who best worships Vishńu: there is no
other mode."

Aurva having thus spoken, Sagara said to him, "Tell me then, venerable
Brahman, what are the duties of caste and condition <span
id="fr_818"></span>[2](#fn_818.md): I am desirous of knowing them." To
which Aurva answered and said, "Attentively listen to the duties which I
shall describe as those severally of the Brahman, the Kshatriya, the
Vaiśya, and the Śúdra. The Brahman should make gifts, should worship the
gods with sacrifices, should be assiduous in studying the Vedas, should
perform ablutions and libations with water, and should preserve the
sacred flame. For the sake of subsistence he may offer sacrifices on
behalf of others, and may instruct them in the Śástras; and he may
accept presents of a liberal description in a becoming manner (or from
respectable persons, and at an appropriate season). He must ever seek to
promote the good of others, and do evil unto none; for the best riches
of a Brahman are universal benevolence. He should look upon the jewels
of another person as if they

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

were pebbles; and should, at proper periods, procreate offspring by his
wife. These are the duties of a Brahman.

"The man of the warrior tribe should cheerfully give presents to
Brahmans, perform various sacrifices, and study the scriptures. His
especial sources of maintenance are arms and the protection of the
earth. The guardianship of the earth is indeed his especial province: by
the discharge of this duty a king attains his objects, and realizes a
share of the merit of all sacrificial rites. By intimidating the bad,
and cherishing the good, the monarch who maintains the discipline of the
different castes secures whatever region he desires.

"Brahmá, the great parent of creation, gave to the Vaiśya the
occupations of commerce and agriculture, and the feeding of flocks and
herds, for his means of livelihood; and sacred study, sacrifice, and
donation are also his duties, as is the observance of fixed and
occasional rites.

"Attendance upon the three regenerate castes is the province of the
Śúdra, and by that he is to subsist, or by the profits of trade, or the
earnings of mechanical labour. He is also to make gifts; and he may
offer the sacrifices in which food is presented, as well as obsequial
offerings <span id="fr_819"></span>[3](#fn_819.md).

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

"Besides these their respective obligations, there are duties equally
incumbent upon all the four castes. These are, the acquisition of
property, for the support of their families; cohabitation with their
wives, for the sake of progeny; tenderness towards all creatures,
patience, humility, truth, purity, contentment, decency of decoration,
gentleness of speech, friendliness; and freedom from envy and repining,
from avarice, and from detraction. These also are the duties of every
condition of life.

"In times of distress the peculiar functions of the castes may be
modified, as you shall hear. A Brahman may follow the occupations of a
Kshatriya or a Vaiśya; the Kshatriya may adopt those of the Vaiśya; and
the Vaiśya those of the Kshatriya: but these two last should never
descend to the functions of the Śúdra, if it be possible to avoid
them <span id="fr_820"></span>[4](#fn_820.md); and if that be not possible,
they must at least shun the functions of the mined castes. I will now,
Rájá, relate to you the duties of the several Ásramas or conditions of
life."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_817"></span>[290:1](vp082.htm#fr_817.md) Sagara, as we shall
see, was a king of the solar race. Aurva was a sage, the grandson of
Bhrigu. When the sons of king Kritavírya persecuted and slew the
children of Bhrigu, to recover the wealth which their father had
lavished upon them, they destroyed even the children in the womb. One of
the women of the race of Bhrigu, in order to preserve her embryo,
secreted it in her thigh (Uru), whence the child on his birth was named
Aurva: from his wrath proceeded a flame, that threatened to destroy the
world; but at the persuasion of his ancestors he cast it into the ocean,
where it abode with the face of a horse. Aurva was afterwards religious
preceptor to Sagara, and bestowed upon him the Ágneyástram, or fiery
weapon, with which he conquered the tribes of barbarians, who had
invaded his patrimonial possessions. Mahábh. Ádi Parvan, Dána Dharma P.,
Hari [Vanśa](errata.htm#13.md).

<span id="fn_818"></span>[291:2](vp082.htm#fr_818.md) Most of the Puráńas,
especially the Kúrma, Padma, Vámana, Agni, and Garud́a, contain chapters
or sections more or less in detail upon the moral and ceremonial duties
of the Hindus; and a considerable portion of the Mahábhárata, especially
in the Moksha Dharma Parvan, is devoted to the same subject. No other
Pauráńik work, however, contains a series of chapters exactly analogous
to those which follow, and which contain a compendious and systematic
description of the Ácháras, or personal and social obligations of the
Hindus. The tenor of the whole is conformable to the institutes of Manu,
and many passages are the same.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[292:3](vp082.htm#fr_819.md) The Pákayajna, or
sacrifice in which food is offered, implies either the worship of the
Viśwadevas, the rites of hospitality, or occasional oblations, on
building a house, the birth of a child, or any occasion of rejoicing. It
is to be understood, however, that this injunction intends his
performing these ceremonies through the agency of a Brahman, as a Śúdra
cannot repeat the Mantras or prayers that accompany them; and it might
be a question how far he might be present, for he ought not even to hear
such prayers repeated. The performance of funeral rites involves some
personal share, and the Śúdra must present the cakes, but it must be
done without Mantras; as the Mitákshara; 'This rite (the presentation of
cakes) must be performed by the Śúdras, without formula:, on the twelfth
day.' The Váyu P. directs the performance of the five great sacrifices
by Śúdras, only omitting the Mantras: It may be suspected that the
Puráńas relaxed in some degree from the original rigour; for it may be
inferred that the great ceremonies were altogether withheld from Śúdras
in the time of Manu, who declares that none have any right or part
(Adhikára) in his code except those who perform rites with Mantras, or
the three regenerate castes (II. 16); and denounces as heinous sins
teaching the <span id="page_293">p. 293</span> Vedas to Śúdras,
performing sacrifices for them, or taking gifts from them. X. 309, 110,
111. Yájnawalkya, however, allows them to perform five great rites with
the Namaskára, or the simple salutation: which Gotama confirms. Some
restrict the sense of Mantra, also, to the prayers of the Vedas, and
allow the Śúdras to use those of the Puráńas; as Śúlapáni: and the
Titthi Tatwa is cited in the Śúdra Kamalákára as allowing them any
Mantras except those of the Vedas.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[293:4](vp082.htm#fr_820.md) This last clause
reconciles what would else appear to be an incompatibility with Manu,
who permits the Vaiśya in time of distress to descend to the servile
acts of a Śúdra. X. 98.
