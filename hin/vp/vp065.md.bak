### CHAP. VII.

Extent and situation of the seven spheres, viz. earth, sky, planets,
Mahar-loka, Janaloka, Tapo-loka, and Satya-loka. Of the egg of Brahmá,
and its elementary envelopes. Of the influence of the energy of Vishńu.

MAITREYA.--The sphere of the whole earth has been described to me by
you, excellent Brahman, and I am now desirous to hear an account of the
other spheres above the world, the Bhuvar-loka and the rest, and the
situation and the dimensions of the celestial luminaries.

PARÁŚARA. The sphere of the earth (or Bhúr-loka), comprehending its
oceans, mountains, and rivers, extends as far as it is illuminated by
the rays of the sun and moon; and to the same extent, both in diameter
and circumference, the sphere of the sky (Bhuvar-loka) spreads above it
(as far upwards as to the planetary sphere, or Swar-loka) <span
id="fr_670"></span>[1](#fn_670.md). The solar orb is situated a hundred
thousand leagues from the earth; and that of the moon an equal distance
from the sun. At the same interval above the moon occurs the orbit of
all the lunar constellations. The planet Budha (Mercury) is two hundred
thousand leagues above the lunar mansions. Śukra (Venus) is at the same
distance from Mercury. Angáraka (Mars) is as far above Venus; and the
priest of the gods (Vrihaspati, or Jupiter) as far from Mars: whilst
Saturn (Sani) is two hundred and fifty thousand leagues beyond Jupiter.
The sphere of the seven Rishis (Ursa Major) is a hundred thousand
leagues above Saturn; and at a similar height above the seven Rishis is
Dhruva (the pole-star), the pivot or axis of the whole planetary circle.
Such, Maitreya, is the elevation of the three spheres (Bhúr, Bhuvar,
Swar) which form the region of the consequences of works. The region of
works is here (or in the land of Bhárata) <span
id="fr_671"></span>[2](#fn_671.md).

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

Above Dhruva, at the distance of ton million leagues, lies the sphere of
saints, or Mahar-loka, the inhabitants of which dwell in it throughout a
Kalpa, or day of Brahmá. At twice that distance is situated Janaloka,
where Sanandana and other pure-minded sons of Brahmá, reside. At four
times the distance, between the two last, lies the Tapo-loka (the sphere
of penance), inhabited by the deities called Vaibhrájas, who are
unconsumable by fire. At six times the distance (or twelve Crores, a
hundred and twenty millions of leagues) is situated Satya-loka, the
sphere of truth, the inhabitants of which never again know death <span
id="fr_672"></span>[3](#fn_672.md).

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

Wherever earthy substance exists, which may be traversed by the feet,
that constitutes the sphere of the earth, the dimensions of which I have
already recounted to you. The region that extends from the earth to the
sun, in which the Siddhas and other celestial beings move, is the
atmospheric sphere, which also I have described. The interval between
the sun and Dhruva, extending fourteen hundred thousand leagues, is
called by those who are acquainted with the system of the universe the
heavenly sphere. These three spheres are termed transitory: the three
highest, Jana, Tapa, and Satya, are styled durable <span
id="fr_673"></span>[4](#fn_673.md): Maharloka, as situated between the two,
has also a mixed character; for although it is deserted at the end of
the Kalpa, it is not destroyed. These seven spheres, together with the
Pátálas, forming the extent of the whole world, I have thus, Maitreya,
explained to you.

The world is encompassed on every side and above and below by the shell
of the egg of Brahmá, in the same manner as the seed of the
wood-apple <span id="fr_674"></span>[5](#fn_674.md) is invested by its
rind. Around the outer surface of the shell flows water, for a space
equal to ten times the diameter of the world. The waters, again, are
encompassed exteriorly by fire; fire by air; and air by Mind; Mind by
the origin of the elements (Ahankára); and that by Intellect: each of
these extends ten times the breadth of that which

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

it encloses; and the last is encircled by the chief Principle,
Pradhána <span id="fr_675"></span>[6](#fn_675.md), which is infinite, and
its extent cannot be enumerated: it is therefore called the boundless
and illimitable cause of all existing things, supreme nature, or
Prakriti; the cause of all mundane eggs, of which there are thousands
and tens of thousands, and millions and thousands of millions, such as
has been described <span id="fr_676"></span>[7](#fn_676.md). Within
Pradhána resides Soul, diffusive, conscious, and self-irradiating, as
fire is inherent in flint <span id="fr_677"></span>[8](#fn_677.md), or
sesamum oil in its seed. Nature (Pradhána) and soul (Pumán) are both of
the character of dependants, and are encompassed by the energy of
Vishńu, which is one with the soul of the world, and which is the cause
of the separation of those two (soul and nature) at the period of
dissolution; of their aggregation in the continuance of things; and of
their combination at the season of creation <span
id="fr_678"></span>[9](#fn_678.md). In the same manner as the wind ruffles
the surface of the water in a hundred bubbles, which of themselves are
inert, so the energy of Vishńu influences the world, consisting of inert
nature and soul. Again, as a tree, consisting of root, stem, and
branches, springs from a primitive seed, and produces other seeds,
whence grow other trees analogous to the first in species, product, and
origin, so from the first unexpanded germ (of nature, or Pradhána)
spring Mahat (Intellect)

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

and the other rudiments of things; from them proceed the grosser
elements; and from them men and gods, who are succeeded by sons and the
sons of sons. In the growth of a tree from the seed, no detriment occurs
to the parent plant, neither is there any waste of beings by the
generation of others. In like manner as space and time and the rest are
the cause of the tree (through the materiality of the seed), so the
divine Hari is the cause of all things by successive developements
(through the materiality of nature) <span
id="fr_679"></span>[10](#fn_679.md). As all the parts of the future plant,
existing in the seed of rice, or the root, the culm, the leaf, the
shoot, the stem, the bud, the fruit, the milk, the grain, the chaff, the
ear, spontaneously evolve when they are in approximation with the
subsidiary means of growth (or earth and water), so gods, men, and other
beings, involved in many actions (or necessarily existing in those
states which are the consequences of good or evil acts), become
manifested only in their full growth, through the influence of the
energy of Vishńu.

This Vishńu is the supreme spirit (Brahma), from whence all this world
proceeds, who is the world, by whom the world subsists, and in whom it
will be resolved. That spirit (or Brahma) is the supreme state of
Vishńu, which is the essence of all that is visible or invisible; with
which all that is, is identical; and whence all animate and inanimate
existence is derived. He is primary nature: he, in a perceptible form,
is the world: and in him all finally melts; through him all things
endure. He is the performer of the rites of devotion: he is the rite: he
is the fruit which it bestows: he is the implements by which it is
performed. There is nothing besides the illimitable Hari.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_670"></span>[212:1](vp065.htm#fr_670.md) Bhúr-loka, the
terrestrial sphere, is earth and the lower regions; from thence to the
sun is the Bhuvar-loka, or atmospheric sphere; and from the sun to
Dhruva is the Swar-loka, or heaven; as subsequently explained in the
text, and in other Puráńas.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[212:2](vp065.htm#fr_671.md) A similar account of
the situations and distances of the planets occurs in the Padma, Kúrma,
and Váyu Puráńas. The Bhágavata has one or two varieties, but they are
of no great importance.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[213:3](vp065.htm#fr_672.md) An account of these
Lokas is met with only in a few of the Puráńas, and is not much more
detailed in them than in our text. The Váyu is most circumstantial.
According to that authority, Mahar, which is so called from a mystical
term Maha, is the abode of the Gańadevas, the Yámas and others, who are
the regents or rulers of the Kalpa, the Kalpádhikáris they are so
designated also in the Kúrma. The Káśí Khańd́a refers the name to Mahas,
'light,' the sphere being invested with radiance. Its inhabitants are
also called lords of the Kalpa: but the commentator explains this to
denote Bhrigu and the other patriarchs, whose lives endure for a day of
Brahmá. The different accounts agree in stating, that when the three
lower spheres are consumed by fire, Mahar-loka is deserted by its
tenants, who repair to the next sphere, or Jana-loka. Jana-loka,
according to the Váyu, is the residence of the Rishis and demigods
during the night of Brahmá, and is termed Jana because the patriarchs
are the progenitors of mankind. The Káśí Khańd́a agrees with the Vishńu
in peopling it with Sanandana and the other ascetic sons of Brahmá, and
with Yogis like themselves. These are placed by the Váyu in the
Tapo-loka, and they and the other sages, and the demigods, after
repeated appearances in the world, become at last Vairájas in the Brahmá
or Satya loka. After many divine ages of residence there with Brahmá,
they are, along with him, absorbed, at the end of his existence into the
indiscrete. The commentator on the Káśí Khańd́a explains Vairája to mean
'relating to, or derived from, Brahmá or Viráj.' The Vairájas are there,
as in the Vishńu Puráńa, placed in the Tapo-loka, and are explained to
be ascetics, mendicants, anchorets, and penitents, who have completed a
course of rigorous austerities. It maybe doubted, however, if the
Pauráńiks have very precise notions regarding these spheres and their
inhabitants, The Puráńas of a decidedly sectarial character add other
and higher worlds to the series. Thus the Kúrma identifies Brahmá-loka
with Vishńu-loka, and has a Rudra-loka above it. The Śiva places
Vishńu-loka above Brahmá-loka, and Rudra-loka above that. In <span
id="page_214">p. 214</span> the Káśí Khańd́a as we have, instead of those
two, Vaikuntha and Kailása, as the lofty worlds of Vishńu and Śiva;
whilst the Brahma Vaivartta has above all a Go-loka, a world or heaven
of cows and Krishńa. These are all evidently additions to the original
system of seven worlds, in which we have probably some relation to the
seven climates of the ancients, the seven stages or degrees of the earth
of the Arabs, and the seven heavens of the Mohammedans, if not to the
seven Amshaspends of the Parsis. Seven, suggested originally perhaps by
the seven planets, seems to have been a favourite number with various
nations of antiquity. Amongst the Hindus it was applied to a variety of
sacred or mythological objects, which are enumerated in a verse in the
Hanumán Nátaka. Ráma is described there as piercing seven palm-trees
with an arrow, on which other groups of seven take fright, as the seven
steeds of the sun, the seven spheres, Munis, seas, continents, and
mothers of the gods.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[214:4](vp065.htm#fr_673.md) Kritika and Akritika;
literally 'made and unmade:' the former being renewed every Kalpa, the
latter perishing only at the end of Brahmá's life.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[214:5](vp065.htm#fr_674.md) Of the Kapittha
(Feronia Elephantum).

<span id="fn_675"></span>[215:6](vp065.htm#fr_675.md) See before the order
in which the elements are evolved ([p. 14](vp036.htm#page_14).md).

<span id="fn_676"></span>[215:7](vp065.htm#fr_676.md) The followers of
Anaximander and Democritus taught "an ἀπειρία κόσμων 'an infinity of
worlds;' and that not only successive in that space which this world of
ours is conceived now to occupy, in respect of the infinity of past and
future time, but also a contemporary infinity of coexistent worlds, at
all times, throughout endless and unbounded space." Intellect. System,
I. 303.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[215:8](vp065.htm#fr_677.md) Literally 'in wood,'
the attrition of two pieces of which does not create, but developes,
their latent heat and flame.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[215:9](vp065.htm#fr_678.md) Thus in Scipio's
dream the divinity is made the external limit of the universe: "Novem
tibi orbibus vel potius globis connexa sunt omnia, quorum unus est
cælestis externus qui reliquos omnes complectitur, summus ipse deus
arcens et continens ceteros:" which Macrobius explains as to be
understood of the Supreme First Cause of all things, only in respect of
his supremacy over all, and from his comprehending as well as creating
all things, and being regarded as the soul of the world: "Quod et
virtutes omnes, quæ illam primæ omnipotentiam summitates sequuntur, aut
ipse faciat aut ipse contineat: ipsam denique Jovem veteres vocaverunt,
et apud theologos Jupiter est mundi anima." In Somn. Scip. c. XVII.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[216:10](vp065.htm#fr_679.md) The two passages in
parentheses are the additions of the commentator, intended to explain
how the deity is the material cause of the world. He is not so of his
own essence, not so immediately, but through the interposition of
Pradhána: 'As however he is the source of Prakriti, he must be
considered the material as well as immaterial cause of being.'
