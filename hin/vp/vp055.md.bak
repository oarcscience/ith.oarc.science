### CHAP. XX.

Vishńu appears to Prahláda. Hirańyakaśipu relents, and is reconciled to
his son: he is put to death by Vishńu as the Nrisinha. Prahláda becomes
king of the Daityas: his posterity: fruit of hearing his story.

THUS meditating upon Vishńu, as identical with his own spirit, Prahláda
became as one with him, and finally regarded himself as the divinity: he
forgot entirely his own individuality, and was conscious of nothing else
than his being the inexhaustible, eternal, supreme soul; and in
consequence of the efficacy of this conviction of identity, the
imperishable Vishńu, whose essence is wisdom, became present in his
heart, which was wholly purified from sin. As soon as, through the force
of his contemplation, Prahláda had become one with Vishńu, the bonds
with which he was bound burst instantly asunder; the ocean was violently
uplifted; and the monsters of the deep were alarmed; earth with all her
forests and mountains trembled; and the prince, putting aside the rocks
which the demons had piled Upon him, came forth from out the main. When
he beheld the outer world again, and contemplated earth and heaven, he
remembered who he was, and recognised himself to be Prahláda; and again
he hymned Purushottama, who is without beginning or end; his mind being
steadily and undeviatingly addressed to the object of his prayers, and
his speech, thoughts, and acts being firmly under control. "Om! glory to
the end of all: to thee, lord, who art subtile and substantial; mutable
and immutable; perceptible and imperceptible; divisible and indivisible;
indefinable and definable; the subject of attributes, and void of
attributes; abiding in qualities, though they abide not in thee;
morphous and amorphous; minute and vast; visible and invisible;
hideousness and beauty; ignorance and wisdom; cause and effect;
existence and non-existence; comprehending all that is good and evil;
essence of perishable and imperishable elements; asylum of undeveloped
rudiments. Oh thou who art both one and many, Vásudeva, first cause of
all; glory be unto thee. Oh thou who art large and small, manifest and
hidden; who art all beings, and art not

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

all beings; and from whom, although distinct from universal cause, the
universe proceeds: to thee, Purushottama, be all glory."

Whilst with mind intent on Vishńu, he thus pronounced his praises, the
divinity, clad in yellow robes, suddenly appeared before him. Startled
at the sight, with hesitating speech Prahláda pronounced repeated
salutations to Vishńu, and said, "Oh thou who removest all worldly
grief, Keśava, be propitious unto me; again sanctify me, Achyuta, by thy
sight." The deity replied, "I am pleased with the faithful attachment
thou hast shown to me: demand from me, Prahláda, whatever thou
desirest." Prahláda replied, "In all the thousand births through which I
may be doomed to pass, may my faith in thee, Achyuta, never know decay;
may passion, as fixed as that which the worldly-minded feel for sensual
pleasures, ever animate my heart, always devoted unto thee." Bhagaván
answered, "Thou hast already devotion unto me, and ever shalt have it:
now choose some boon, whatever is in thy wish." Prahláda then said, "I
have been hated, for that I assiduously proclaimed thy praise: do thou,
oh lord, pardon in my father this sin that he Bath committed. Weapons
have been hurled against me; I have been thrown into the flames; I have
been bitten by venomous snakes; and poison has been mixed with my food;
I have been bound and cast into the sea; and heavy rocks have been
heaped upon me: but all this, and whatever ill beside has been wrought
against me; whatever wickedness has been done to me, because I put my
faith in thee; all, through thy mercy, has been suffered by me unharmed:
and do thou therefore free my father from this iniquity." To this
application Vishńu replied, "All this shall be unto thee, through my
favour: but I give thee another boon: demand it, son of the Asura."
Prahláda answered and said, "All my desires, oh lord, have been
fulfilled by the boon that thou hast granted, that my faith in thee
shall never know decay. Wealth, virtue, love, are as nothing; for even
liberation is in his reach whose faith is firm in thee, root of the
universal world." Vishńu said, "Since thy heart is filled immovably with
trust in me, thou shalt, through my blessing, attain freedom from
existence." Thus saying, Vishńu vanished from his sight; and Prahláda
repaired to his father, and bowed down before him. His father

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

kissed him on the forehead <span id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_324.md), and
embraced him, and shed tears, and said, "Dost thou live, my son?" And
the great Asura repented of his former cruelty, and treated him with
kindness: and Prahláda, fulfilling his duties like any other youth,
continued diligent in the service of his preceptor and his father. After
his father had been put to death by Vishńu in the form of the
man-lion <span id="fr_325"></span>[2](#fn_325.md), Prahláda became the
sovereign of the Daityas; and possessing the splendours of royalty
consequent upon his piety, exercised extensive sway, and was blessed
with a numerous progeny. At the expiration of an authority which was the
reward of his meritorious acts, he was freed from the consequences of
moral merit or demerit, and obtained, through meditation on the deity,
final exemption from existence.

Such, Maitreya, was the Daitya Prahláda, the wise and faithful
worshipper of Vishńu, of whom you wished to hear; and such was his
miraculous power. Whoever listens to the history of Prahláda is
immediately cleansed from his sins: the iniquities that he commits, by
night or by day, shall be expiated by once hearing, or once reading, the
history of Prahláda. The perusal of this history on the day of full
moon, of new moon, or on the eighth or twelfth day of the lunation <span
id="fr_326"></span>[3](#fn_326.md),

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

shall yield fruit equal to the donation of a cow <span
id="fr_327"></span>[4](#fn_327.md). As Vishńu protected Prahláda in all the
calamities to which he was exposed, so shall the deity protect him who
listens constantly to the tale <span id="fr_328"></span>[5](#fn_328.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_324"></span>[145:1](vp055.htm#fr_324.md) Literally, 'having
smelt his forehead.' I have elsewhere had occasion to observe this
practice: Hindu Theatre, II. 45.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[145:2](vp055.htm#fr_325.md) Here is another
instance of that brief reference to popular and prior legends, which is
frequent in this Puráńa. The man-lion Avatára is referred to in several
of the Puráńas, but I have met with the story in detail only in the
Bhágavata. It is there said that Hirańyakaśipu asks his son, why, if
Vishńu is every where, he is not visible in a pillar in the hall, where
they are assembled. He then rises, and strikes the column with his fist;
on which Vishńu, in a form which is neither wholly a lion nor a man,
issues from it, and a conflict ensues, which ends in Hirańyakaśipu's
being torn to pieces. Even this account, therefore, is not in all
particulars the same as the popular version of the story.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[145:3](vp055.htm#fr_326.md) The days of full and
new moon are sacred with all sects of Hindus: the eighth and twelfth
days of the lunar half month were considered holy by the Vaishńavas, as
appears from the text. The eighth maintains its character in a great
degree from the eighth of Bhádra being the birthday of Krishńa; but the
eleventh, in more recent Vaishńava works, as the Brahma Vaivartta P.,
has taken the place of the twelfth, and is even more sacred than the
eighth.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[146:4](vp055.htm#fr_327.md) Or any solemn gift;
that of a cow is held particularly sacred; but it implies accompaniments
of a more costly character, ornaments and gold.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[146:5](vp055.htm#fr_328.md) The legend of
Prahláda is inserted in detail in the Bhágavata and Náradíya Puráńas,
and in the Uttara Khańd́a of the Padma: it is adverted to more briefly in
the Váyu, Linga, Kúrma, &c., in the Moksha Dharma of the Mahábhárata,
and in the Hari Vanśa.
