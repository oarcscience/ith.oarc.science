### CHAP. XIX.

Descendants of Puru. Birth of Bharata, the son of Dushyanta: his sons
killed: adopts Bharadwája or Vitatha. Hastin, founder of Hastinapur.
Sons of Ajámíd́ha, and the races derived from them, as Pánchálas, &c.
Kripa and Kripí found by Śántanu. Descendants of Riksha, the son of
Ajámíd́ha. Kurukshetra named from Kuru. Jarásandha and others, kings of
Magadhá.

THE son of Puru was Janamejaya; his son was Práchinvat; his son was
Pravíra; his son was Manasyu; his son was Bhayada <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[1](#fn_1216.md); his son was Sudyumna <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[2](#fn_1217.md); his son was Bahugava <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[3](#fn_1218.md); his son was Samyáti <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[4](#fn_1219.md); his son was Ahamyáti <span
id="fr_1220"></span>[5](#fn_1220.md); his son was Raudráśwa <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[6](#fn_1221.md), who had ten sons, Riteyu <span
id="fr_1222"></span>[7](#fn_1222.md), Kaksheyu, Sthańd́ileyu, Ghriteyu,
Jaleyu, Sthaleyu, Santateyu, Dhaneyu, Vaneyu, and Vrateyu <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[8](#fn_1223.md). The son of Riteyu was Rantinára <span
id="fr_1224"></span>[9](#fn_1224.md),

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span>

whose sons were Tansu, Apratiratha, and Dhruva <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[10](#fn_1225.md). The son of the second of these was
Kańwa, and his son was Medhátithi, from whom the Káńwáyána
Brahmanas <span id="fr_1226"></span>[11](#fn_1226.md) descended.
Anila <span id="fr_1227"></span>[12](#fn_1227.md) was the son of Tansu, and
he had four sons, of whom Dushyanta was the elder <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[13](#fn_1228.md). The son of

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dushyanta was the
emperor Bharata; a verse explanatory of his name is chaunted by the
gods; "The mother is only the receptacle; it is the father by whom a son
is begotten. Cherish thy son, Dushyanta; treat not Śakuntalá with
disrespect. Sons, who are born from the paternal loins, rescue their
progenitors from the infernal regions. Thou art the parent of this boy;
Śakuntalá has spoken truth." From the expression 'cherish,' Bharaswa,
the prince was called Bharata <span id="fr_1229"></span>[14](#fn_1229.md).

Bharata had by different wives nine sons, but they were put to death by
their own mothers, because Bharata remarked that they bore no
resemblance to him, and the women were afraid that he would therefore
desert them. The birth of his sons being thus unavailing, Bharata
sacrificed to the Maruts, and they gave him Bharadwája, the son of
Vrihaspati by Mamata the wife of Utathya, expelled by the kick of
Dirghatamas, his half brother, before his time. This verse explains the
purport of his appellation; "'Silly woman,' said Vrihaspati, 'cherish
this child of two fathers' (bhara dwá-jam). 'No, Vrihaspati,' replied
Mamatá, 'do you take care of him.' So saying, they both abandoned him;
but from their expressions the boy was called Bharadwája." He was also
termed Vitatha, in allusion to the unprofitable (vitatha) birth of the
sons of Bharata <span id="fr_1230"></span>[15](#fn_1230.md). The son of
Vitatha was

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhavanmanyu <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[16](#fn_1231.md); his sons were many, and amongst them
the chief were Vrihatkshatra, Mahávíryya, Nara, and Garga <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[17](#fn_1232.md). The son of Nara was Sankriti; his
sons were Ruchiradhí and Rantideva <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[18](#fn_1233.md). The son of Garga

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

was Sini <span id="fr_1234"></span>[19](#fn_1234.md), and their descendants
called Gárgyas and Śainyas, although Kshatriyas by birth, became
Brahmans <span id="fr_1235"></span>[20](#fn_1235.md). The son of Mahávíryya
was Urukshaya <span id="fr_1236"></span>[21](#fn_1236.md), who had three
sons, Trayyáruńa, Pushkarin, and Kapi <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[22](#fn_1237.md); the last of whom became a Brahman.
The son of Vrihatkshatra was Suhotra <span
id="fr_1238"></span>[23](#fn_1238.md), whose son was Hastin, who founded
the city of

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hastinápur <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[24](#fn_1239.md). The sons of Hastin were
Ajamíd́ha <span id="fr_1240"></span>[25](#fn_1240.md), Dwimíd́ha, and
Purumíd́ha. One son of Ajamíd́ha was Kańwa, whose son was Medhátithi <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[26](#fn_1241.md); his other son was Vrihadishu, whose
son was Vrihadvasu <span id="fr_1242"></span>[27](#fn_1242.md); his son was
Vrihatkarman <span id="fr_1243"></span>[28](#fn_1243.md); his son was
Jayadratha <span id="fr_1244"></span>[29](#fn_1244.md); his son was
Viśwajit <span id="fr_1245"></span>[30](#fn_1245.md); his son was Senajit,
whose sons were Ruchiráśwa, Káśya, Drid́hadhanush, and Vasahanu <span
id="fr_1246"></span>[31](#fn_1246.md). The son of Ruchiráśwa was
Prithusena; his son was Pára; his son was Nípa; he had a hundred sons,
of whom Samara, the principal, was the ruler of Kámpilya <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[32](#fn_1247.md). Samara had three sons, Pára,
Sampára, Sadaśwa. The son of Pára was Prithu; his son was Sukriti; his
son was Vibhrátra <span id="fr_1248"></span>[33](#fn_1248.md); his son was
Anuha, who married Kritwí, the daughter of Śuka (the son of Vyása), and
had by her Brahmadatta <span id="fr_1249"></span>[34](#fn_1249.md);

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

his son was Viśwaksena; his son was Udaksena <span
id="fr_1250"></span>[35](#fn_1250.md); and his son was Bhallát́a <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[36](#fn_1251.md).

The son of Dwimíd́ha <span id="fr_1252"></span>[37](#fn_1252.md) was
Yavínara; his son was Dhritimat <span
id="fr_1253"></span>[38](#fn_1253.md); his son was Satyadhriti; his son was
Drid́hanemi; his son was Supárśwa <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[39](#fn_1254.md); his son was Sumati; his son was
Sannatimat; his son was Krita, to whom Hirańyanábha taught the
philosophy of the Yoga, and he compiled twenty-four Sanhitás (or
compendia) for the use of the eastern Brahmans, who study the
Sáma-veda <span id="fr_1255"></span>[40](#fn_1255.md). The son of Krita was
Ugráyudha, by whose prowess the Nípa race of Kshatriyas was
destroyed <span id="fr_1256"></span>[41](#fn_1256.md); his son was Kshemya;
his son was Suvíra; his son was Nripanjaya <span
id="fr_1257"></span>[42](#fn_1257.md); his son was Bahuratha. These were
all called Pauravas.

Ajamíd́ha had a wife called Níliní, and by her he had a son named Níla;
his son was Śánti; his son was Śuśánti; his son was Purujánu <span
id="fr_1258"></span>[43](#fn_1258.md); his son was Chakshu <span
id="fr_1259"></span>[44](#fn_1259.md); his son was Haryyaśwa <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[45](#fn_1260.md), who had five sons,

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mudgala,
Śrinjaya <span id="fr_1261"></span>[46](#fn_1261.md), Vrihadishu,
Pravíra <span id="fr_1262"></span>[47](#fn_1262.md), and Kámpilya <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[48](#fn_1263.md). Their father said, "These my five
(pancha) sons are able (alam) to protect the countries;" and hence they
were termed the Pánchálas <span id="fr_1264"></span>[49](#fn_1264.md). From
Mudgala descended the Maudgalya Brahmans <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[50](#fn_1265.md): he had also a son named
Bahwaśwa <span id="fr_1266"></span>[51](#fn_1266.md), who had two children,
twins, a son and daughter, Divodása and Ahalyá. The son of Śaradwat or
Gautama by Ahalyá was Śatánanda <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[52](#fn_1267.md); his son was Satyadhriti, who was a
proficient in military science. Being enamoured of the nymph Urvaśí,
Satyadhriti was the parent of two children, a boy and a girl. Śántanu, a
Raja, whilst hunting, found these children exposed in a clump of long
Śara grass; and, compassionating their condition, took them, and brought
them up. As they were nurtured through pity (kripá), they were called
Kripa and Kripí. The latter became the wife of Drońa, and the mother of
Aswattháman.

The son of Divodása was Mitráyu <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[53](#fn_1268.md); his son was Chyavana; his son

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

was Sudása; his son was Saudása, also called Sahadeva; his son was
Somaka; he had a hundred sons, of whom Jantu was the eldest, and
Prishata the youngest. The son of Prishata was Drupada; his son was
Dhrisht́adyumna; his son was Drisht́aketu.

Another son of Ajamíd́ha was named Riksha <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[54](#fn_1269.md); his son was Samvarańa; his son was
Kuru, who gave his name to the holy district Kurukshetra; his sons were
Sudhanush, Jahnu, Paríkshit, and many others <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[55](#fn_1270.md). The son of Sudhanush was Suhotra;
his son was Chyavana; his son was Krítaka <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[56](#fn_1271.md); his son was Uparichara the
Vasu <span id="fr_1272"></span>[57](#fn_1272.md), who had seven children,
Vrihadratha, Pratyagra, Kuśámba, Mávella, Matsya, and others. The son of
Vrihadratha was Kuśágra; his son was Rishabha <span
id="fr_1273"></span>[58](#fn_1273.md); his son was Pushpavat; his son was
Satyadhrita <span id="fr_1274"></span>[59](#fn_1274.md); his son was
Sudhanwan; and his son was Jantu. Vrihadratha had another son, who being
born in two

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

parts, which were put together (sandhita) by a female fiend named Jará,
he was denominated Jarásandha <span id="fr_1275"></span>[60](#fn_1275.md);
his son was Sahadeva; his son was Somápi <span
id="fr_1276"></span>[61](#fn_1276.md); his son was Srutaśravas <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[62](#fn_1277.md). These were kings of Magadhá.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[447:1](vp112.htm#fr_1216.md) Abhayada: Váyu.
Vítamaya: Agni. Vátáyudha: Matsya. Chárupáda: Bhágavata. The
Mahábhárata, Ádi P., p. 136, 138, has two accounts of the descendants of
Puru, differing materially in the beginning from each other, and from
the lists of the Puráńas. In the first, Pravíra is made the son of Puru;
his son is Manasyu, who has three sons, Śakta, Sanhanana, and Vágmin;
and there the line stops. Another son of Puru is Raudráśwa, whose sons
are Richeyu and the rest, as in our text; making them the second in
descent, instead of the eleventh. In the second list, the son of Puru is
Janamejaya, whose successors are Práchinvat, Samyáti, Ahamyáti,
Śarvabhauma, Jayatsena, Aváchína, Ariha, Mahábhauma, Ayutanáyin,
Akrodhana, Devátithi, Ariha, Riksha, Matinára, who is therefore the
fifteenth from Puru, instead of the fourth as in the first account, or
the twelfth as in the text.

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[447:2](vp112.htm#fr_1217.md) Dhundu: Váyu.
Śambhu: Agni. Sudhanwan: Bráhma.

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[447:3](vp112.htm#fr_1218.md) Bahuvidha: Agni and
Matsya.

<span id="fn_1219"></span>[447:4](vp112.htm#fr_1219.md) Sampáti: Agni.

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[447:5](vp112.htm#fr_1220.md) Omitted: Váyu.
Bahuvádin: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1221"></span>[447:6](vp112.htm#fr_1221.md) Bhadráśwa: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1222"></span>[447:7](vp112.htm#fr_1222.md) Rájeyu: Váyu.
Richeyu: Agni. They were the sons of the Apsaras Ghritáchí: or of
Misrakeśí: Mahábhárata. The Bráhma P. and Hari V. have very
unaccountably, and in opposition to all other authorities, transferred
the whole of the descendants of Anu to this family; substituting for Anu
the second name in our text, Kaksheyu. ([p. 444](vp111.htm#page_444)..md)

<span id="fn_1223"></span>[447:8](vp112.htm#fr_1223.md) The Váyu names also
ten daughters, Rudrá, Śúdrá, Madrá, Subhágá, Amalajá, Talá, Khalá,
Gopajálá, Támrarasá, and Ratnakútí; and adds that they were married to
Prabhákara, a Rishi of the race of Atri. The Bráhma P. and Hari V. have
a legend of the birth of Soma, the moon, from him and one of these ten;
who succeeded to the power and prerogatives of Atri. The sons of the
other wives were less distinguished, but they formed families eminent
amongst holy Brahmans, called Swastyátreyas.

<span id="fn_1224"></span>[447:9](vp112.htm#fr_1224.md) Atimára or
Atibhára: Bhágavata. <span id="page_448">p. 448</span> Antinára: Matsya.
Matinára: Mahábhárata, Agni and Bráhma. According to the Matsya and Hari
V. (not in the Bráhma P.), Gaurí, the daughter of this prince, was the
mother of Mándhátri, of the family of Ikshwáku.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[448:10](vp112.htm#fr_1225.md) In place of these
the Matsya has Amúrttirayas and Nrichandra, and there are several
varieties in the nomenclature. In place of the first we have Vasu or
Trasu, Váyu; Tansurogha, Agni; Tansurodha, Bráhma; and Sumati,
Bhágavata. Pratiratha is read for the second in the Agni and Brahmá; and
for the third, Suratha, Agni; Subáhu, Hari V.

<span id="fn_1226"></span>[448:11](vp112.htm#fr_1226.md) Medhátithi is the
author of many hymns in the Rig-veda, and we have therefore Brahmans and
religious teachers descended from Kshatriyas.

<span id="fn_1227"></span>[448:12](vp112.htm#fr_1227.md) Malina: Váyu.
Raibhya: Bhágavata. Dharmanetra: Bráhma P. The Hari V. omits him, making
sad blundering work of the whole passage. Thus the construction is such
as to intimate that Tansu or Tansurodha had a wife named Ilá, the
daughter of Medhátithi; that is, his brother's great-granddaughter: but
this, as the commentator observes, is contrary to common sense, and he
would read it therefore, 'The daughter of him who was named Ilin;' a
Raja so called: but in the Váyu and Matsya we have Iliná, the daughter
of Yama, married to Tansu, and mother of Malina or Anila; more correctly
perhaps Ailina. The blunder of the Hari V. therefore arises from the
compiler's reading Yasya, 'of whom,' instead of Yamasya, 'Yama.' It is
not an error of transcription, for the metre requires Yasya, and the
remark of the commentator proves the correctness of the reading. The
name occurs Ílina, the son of Tansu, in the Mahábhárata, agreeably to
the Anuvanśa śloka, which is there quoted. 'Saraswatí bore Tansu to
Matinára, and Tansu begot a son, Ílina, by Kálingí.'

<span id="fn_1228"></span>[448:13](vp112.htm#fr_1228.md) The Váyu, Matsya,
and Bhágavata agree with our text in making these the grandsons of
Tansu: even the Bráhma P. concurs, but the Hari V. makes them his sons,
having apparently transformed Tansosuta, the son of Tansu, into a
synonyme of Tansu, or Tansurodha; as in these parallel passages: 'The
son of Tansu was the illustrious sage Dharmanetra: Upadánaví had from
him four excellent sons.' Bráhma P. 'Tansurodha was a royal sage, the
illustrious institutor of laws. Upadánaví had four sons from
Tansurodha.' Hari V. The commentator explains Dharmanetra to be
'institutor <span id="page_449">p. 449</span> of laws.' We have
Upadánaví before, as the daughter of Vrishaparvan the Daitya, married to
Hirańyáksha. Hamilton (Buchanan) calls her the wife of Sughora. The four
sons are named in other authorities, with some variations: Dushyanta,
Sushyanta or Rishyanta or Sumanta, Pravíra and Anagha or Naya. The
Mahábhárata enumerates five, Dushyanta, Śúra, Bhíma, Vasu, and Pravasu,
but makes them the sons of Ílina and grandsons of Tansu.

<span id="fn_1229"></span>[449:14](vp112.htm#fr_1229.md) These two Ślokas
are taken from the Mahábhárata, Ádi Parvan, p. 112, and are part of the
testimony borne by a heavenly messenger to the birth of Bharata. They
are repeated in the same book, in the account of the family of Puru, p.
139. They occur, with a slight variation of the order, in other Puráńas,
as the Váyu, &c., and shew the greater antiquity of the story of
Śakuntalá, although they do not narrate it. The meaning of the name
Bharata is differently explained in Śakuntalá; he is said to be so
called from supporting' the world: he is also there named Śarvadamana,
'the conqueror of all.'

<span id="fn_1230"></span>[449:15](vp112.htm#fr_1230.md) The Bráhma P. and
Hari V., the latter especially, appear to have modified this legend,
with the view perhaps of reconciling those circumstances which are
related of Bharadwája as a sage with his <span id="page_450">p.
450</span> history as a king. Whilst therefore they state that
Bharadwája was brought by the winds to Bharata, they state that he was
so brought to perform a sacrifice, by which a son was born, whom
Bharadwája also inaugurated. In the Váyu, Matsya, and Agni, however, the
story is much more consistently narrated; and Bharadwája, being
abandoned by his natural parent, is brought by the winds, as a child,
not as a sage; and being adopted by Bharata, is one and the same with
Vitatha, as our text relates. Thus in the Váyu, the Maruts bring to
Bharata, already sacrificing for progeny, Bharadwája, the son of
Vrihaspati; and Bharata receiving him, says, "This Bharadwája shall be
Vitatha." The Matsya also says, the Maruts in compassion took the child,
and being pleased with Bharata's worship, gave it to him, and he was
named Vitatha. And the Agni tells the whole story in one verse: 'Then
the son of Vrihaspati, being taken by the winds; Bharadwája was
transferred with sacrifice, and was Vitatha.' The account given in the
Bhágavata is to the same purpose. The commentator on the text also makes
the matter clear enough: 'The name of Bharadwája in the condition of son
of Bharata was Vitatha.' It is clear that a new-born infant could not be
the officiating priest at a sacrifice for his own adoption, whatever the
compiler of the Hari Vanśa may please to assert. From Bharadwája, a
Brahman by birth, and king by adoption, descended Brahmans and
Kshatriyas, the children of two fathers: The Mahábhárata, in the Ádi
Parvan, tells the story very simply. In one place, p. 136. v. 3710, it
says that Bharata, on the birth of his children proving vain, obtained
from Bharadwája, by great sacrifices, a son, Bhúmanyu; and in another
passage it makes Bhúmanyu the son of Bharata by Sunandá, daughter of
Śarvasena, king of Káśí; p. 139. v. 3785. The two are not incompatible.

<span id="fn_1231"></span>[450:16](vp112.htm#fr_1231.md) Manyu: Bhágavata.
Suketu: Agni. But the Bráhma and Hari V. omit this and the next
generation, and make Suhotra, Anuhotra, Gaya, Garga, and Kapila the sons
of Vitatha: they then assign to Suhotra two sons, Káśíka and
Ghritsamati, and identify them and their descendants with the progeny of
Áyu, who were kings of Káśí (see [p. 409](vp101.htm#page_409.md). n.
[15](vp101.htm#fn_1083).md); a piece of confusion unwarranted by any other
authority except the Agni.

<span id="fn_1232"></span>[450:17](vp112.htm#fr_1232.md) Vrihat, Ahárya,
Nara, Garga: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1233"></span>[450:18](vp112.htm#fr_1233.md) Guruvírya and
Trideva: Váyu. The first is called Gurudhí, Matsya; and Guru, <span
id="page_451">p. 451</span> Bhágavata: they agree in Rantideva. The
Bhágavata describes the great liberality of this prince, and his
practice of Yoga. According to a legend preserved in the Megha Duta, his
sacrifices of kine were so numerous, that their blood formed the river
Charmanvatí, the modern Chambal.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[451:19](vp112.htm#fr_1234.md) Śivi: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[451:20](vp112.htm#fr_1235.md) The other
authorities concur in this statement; thus furnishing an additional
instance of one caste proceeding from another. No reason is assigned:
the commentator says it was from some cause.

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[451:21](vp112.htm#fr_1236.md) Durbhakshaya:
Váyu. Urukshat: Matsya. Duritakshaya: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[451:22](vp112.htm#fr_1237.md) Trayyáruńi,
Pushkaráruńi, Kavi; all became Brahmans: \#\#\# Matsya: and there were
three chief branches of the Kávyas, or descendants of Kavi; \#\#\#
Gargas, Sankritis, and Kávyas. Ibid.

<span id="fn_1238"></span>[451:23](vp112.htm#fr_1238.md) In the
Mahábhárata, Suhotra is the son of Bhúmanyu; and in one place the father
of Ajamíd́ha, &c., and in another of Hastin. The Bráhma P. in some
degree, and the Hari Vanśa in a still greater, have made most
extraordinary confusion in the instance of this name. In our text and in
all the best authorities we have three Suhotras, perfectly distinct: 1.
Suhotra great-grandson of Amávasu, father of Jahnu, and ancestor of
Viswámitra and the Kauśikas (see [p. 308](vp085.htm#page_308).md); 2.
Suhotra son of Kshatravriddha, and grandson of Ayus, and progenitor of
the race of Káśí kings ([p. 406](vp101.htm#page_406).md); and 3. Suhotra
the son of Vrihatkshatra, grandson of Vitatha, and parent of Hastin. In
the two blundering compilations mentioned, we have, first (Hari V. c.
20), a Suhotra son of Vrihatkshatra, of the race of Puru; his descent is
not given, but, from the names which follow Suhotra, the dynasty is that
of our present text: secondly (Hari V. c. 27), Suhotra son of Kánchana,
of the line of Amávasu, and father of Jahnu, &c.: thirdly (Hari V. c.
29), Suhotra the son of Kshatravriddha, and progenitor of the Káśí
kings: fourthly (Hari V. 32), we have the first and third of these
personages confounded; Suhotra is made the son of Vitatha, and
progenitor of the Káśí kings, the dynasty of whom is repeated; thus
connecting them with the line of Puru instead of Áyus, in opposition to
all authority. Again, we have a notable piece of confusion, and Suhotra
the son of Vitatha is made the father of Vrihat, the father of the three
princes who in our text and in the Hari V. (c. 20) are the sons of
Hastin; and amongst whom Ajamíd́ha is made the father of Jahnu, and
ancestor of the Kauśikas, instead of being, as in c. 27, and as every
where else, of the family of Amávasu. The source of all this confusion
is obvious. The compilers extracted all the authentic traditions
accurately enough, but, puzzled by the identity of name, they have also
<span id="page_452">p. 452</span> mixed the different accounts together,
and caused very absurd and needless perplexity. It is quite clear also
that the Hari Vanua does not deserve the pains taken, and taken
fruitlessly, by Mr. Hamilton and M. Langlois to reduce it to
consistency. It is of no weight whatever as an authority for the
dynasties of kings, although it furnishes some particular details, which
it has picked up possibly from authentic sources not now available.

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[452:24](vp112.htm#fr_1239.md) It was finally
ruined by the encroachments of the Ganges, but vestiges of it were, at
least until lately, to be traced along the river, nearly in a line with
Delhi, about sixty miles to the east.

<span id="fn_1240"></span>[452:25](vp112.htm#fr_1240.md) In one place, son
of Suhotra; in another, grandson of Hastin: Mahábhárata.

<span id="fn_1241"></span>[452:26](vp112.htm#fr_1241.md) The copies agree
in this reading, yet it can scarcely be correct. Kańwa has already been
noticed as the son of Apratiratha. According to the Bhágavata, the elder
son of Ajamíd́ha was Priyamedhas, from whom a tribe of Brahmans
descended. The Matsya has Vrihaddhanush, and names the wife of Ajamíd́ha,
Dhúminí. It also however, along with the Váyu, makes Kańwa the son of
Ajamíd́ha by his wife Kesiní.

<span id="fn_1242"></span>[452:27](vp112.htm#fr_1242.md) Vrihaddhanush:

<span id="fn_1247"></span>[452:32](vp112.htm#fr_1247.md) Kámpilya appears
to be the Kampil of the Mohammedans, situated in the Doab. It was
included in southern Pánchála. The Matsya makes Samara the son of Káśya.

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[452:33](vp112.htm#fr_1248.md) Vibhrája in MSS.,
also in the Váyu.

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[452:34](vp112.htm#fr_1249.md) The Bhágavata
omits the descents subsequent to Nípa, and makes Brahmadatta the son of
Nípa by Sukriti. In the Hari V. is a curious legend of the different
transmigrations of Brahmadatta and his six companions, who were
successively as many Brahmans, then foresters, then <span
id="page_453">p. 453</span> deer, then water-fowl, then swans, and
finally Brahmans again, when with the king they obtained liberation.
According to the Bhágavata, Brahmadatta composed a treatise on the Yoga,
a Yoga tantra.

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[453:35](vp112.htm#fr_1250.md) Dańd́asena: Hari V.

<span id="fn_1251"></span>[453:36](vp112.htm#fr_1251.md) Bhalláka: Váyu.
Bhalláda: Bhágavata. The Váyu makes him the last of the race. The Hari
V. adds that he was killed by Karńa. The Matsya names his successor
Janamejaya, when the race of the Nípas was exterminated by Ugráyudha; as
noticed below.

<span id="fn_1252"></span>[453:37](vp112.htm#fr_1252.md) So the Váyu and
Bhágavata. The Matsya and Hari V., with less consistency, derive this
family also from Ajamíd́ha.

<span id="fn_1253"></span>[453:38](vp112.htm#fr_1253.md) Kritimat:
Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1254"></span>[453:39](vp112.htm#fr_1254.md) Between these two
the Váyu inserts Mahat and Rukmaratha. The Matsya, Sudhanwan,
Śarvabhauma, Mahápaurava, and Rukmadhara. The Bráhma P., Sudharman,
Śarvabhauma, Mahat, and Rukmaratha.

<span id="fn_1255"></span>[453:40](vp112.htm#fr_1255.md) The Bhágavata says
he was the author of six Sanhitás of the Sáma-veda. (See p. 282.)

<span id="fn_1256"></span>[453:41](vp112.htm#fr_1256.md) The Hari V. says
he killed Nípa, the grandfather of Prishata, but it had previously
stated that it was the son of Bhallát́a, several descents after Nípa, who
was killed by Ugráyudha: and again (c. 32), Prishata, conformably to
other authorities, appears as the father of Drupada, in the family of
Śrinjaya. The Hari V. relates the destruction of Ugráyudha by Bhíshma,
in consequence of his demanding in marriage the widow of Śántanu: after
which, Prishata, it is said, recovered possession of Kámpilya.

<span id="fn_1257"></span>[453:42](vp112.htm#fr_1257.md) Puranjaya:
Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1258"></span>[453:43](vp112.htm#fr_1258.md) Purujáti: Váyu.
Puruja: Bhágavata. The Bráhma P. and Hari V. omit Níla and Śánti.

<span id="fn_1259"></span>[453:44](vp112.htm#fr_1259.md) Riksha: Váyu.
Prithu: Matsya. Arka: Bhágavata. Omitted: Bráhma.

<span id="fn_1260"></span>[453:45](vp112.htm#fr_1260.md) Báhyáswa: Agni.
Bhadráśwa: Mats. Bharmyaswa: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1261"></span>[454:46](vp112.htm#fr_1261.md) Jaya: Matsya.
Sanjaya: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1262"></span>[454:47](vp112.htm#fr_1262.md) Yavínara: Agni and
Bhágavata. Javínara: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1263"></span>[454:48](vp112.htm#fr_1263.md) Kapila: Mats.
Krimiláśwa: Bráhma.

<span id="fn_1264"></span>[454:49](vp112.htm#fr_1264.md) Pánchála was at
first the country north and west of Delhi, between the foot of the
Himálaya and the Chambal. It was afterwards divided into northern and
southern Pánchála, separated by the Ganges. Mákandi on the Ganges and
Kámpilya were the chief cities of the latter; Ahikshetra in the former.
The Pánchálas, according to the Mahábhárata, expelled Samvarańa from
Hastinápur, but it was recovered by Kuru. The purport of the term
Pánchála is similarly explained in other Puráńas. In the Mahábhárata
they are the grandsons of Ajamíd́ha.

<span id="fn_1265"></span>[454:50](vp112.htm#fr_1265.md) The Matsya says
that they, as well as the Káńwas, were all followers or partisans of
Angiras: \#\#\#. The Hari V. has nearly the same words.

<span id="fn_1266"></span>[454:51](vp112.htm#fr_1266.md) Badhryáśwa: Váyu.
Pancháśwa: Agni. Bandhyáśwa: Matsya. Bhármya: Bhágavata. But there is
some indistinctness as to his descent. The Matsya and Hari V. give the
son of Mudgala only his patronymic Maudgalya. According to the first,
his son was Indrasena; and his son, Bandhyáśwa. The second makes
Badhryáśwa the son of Maudgalya by Indrasena. The Bhágavata makes
Bhármya, the patronymic of Mudgala, the son of Bharmyáśwa, and who is
the father of Divodása and Ahalyá: \#\#\#. The commentator has, \#\#\#.

<span id="fn_1267"></span>[454:52](vp112.htm#fr_1267.md) In the Rámayańa,
Śatánanda appears as the family priest of Janaka, the father of Śítá.

<span id="fn_1268"></span>[454:53](vp112.htm#fr_1268.md) From whom the
Maitreya Brahmans were descended: Hari V. In the Matsya and Agni the son
of Mitráyu is called Maitreya (see [p. 3](vp035.htm#page_3).md). The Bráhma
P. and Hari V. here close the lineage of <span id="page_455">p.
455</span> Divodása: the Agni adds but one name, Somápi. They then
proceed with the descendants of Śrinjaya, one of the Pánchálas, or
Panchadhanush, Somadatta, Sahadeva, and then as in our text. The Váyu
and Bhágavata agree with the latter in making the line continuous from
Divodása. According to the Matsya and Bráhma P. the race of Ajamíd́ha
became extinct in the person of Sahadeva, but Ajamíd́ha himself was
reborn as Somaka, in order to continue his lineage, which was thence
called the Somaka family. It was in the reign of Drupada that the
possessions of the Pánchálas were divided; Drońa, assisted by the
Páńd́avas, conquering the country, and ceding the southern portion again
to Drupada, as related in the Mahábhárata. The two princes last named in
the list figure in the great war.

<span id="fn_1269"></span>[455:54](vp112.htm#fr_1269.md) The Hari V. gives
him two brothers, Dhúmravarńa and Sudarśana. In the Mahábhárata one list
agrees with the text; the other calls Samvarańa the son of Ajamíd́ha by
his wife Rikshá.

<span id="fn_1270"></span>[455:55](vp112.htm#fr_1270.md) One other is named
in the Bhágavata, Matsya, Bráhma, and Agni; Animejaya, Arimarddana, and
Nishadháśwa. The Hari V. has Sudhanwat in place of Jahnu; having also
Sudhanush.

<span id="fn_1271"></span>[455:56](vp112.htm#fr_1271.md) Krita: Váyu.
Kritayajna: Bráhma. Krimi: Matsya. Kriti: Bhágavata.

<span id="fn_1272"></span>[455:57](vp112.htm#fr_1272.md) The story of
Uparichara, or a Vasu who by command of Indra became king of Chedi, is
told in the Mahábhárata, Ádi Parvan (vol. I. p. 85). He is there said to
have at first five sons, Vrihadratha, king of Magadhá, Pratyagra,
Kuśámba, also called Maniváhana, Mávella, and Yadu, by his wife Giriká;
afterwards he has, by Adriká, an Apsaras condemned to the form of a
fish, Matsya a son, and Satyavatí or Kálí a daughter: the latter was the
mother of Vyása. The same legend is referred to in the accounts of
Uparichara and his family in the Bhágavata, Matsya, Hari V., &c.

<span id="fn_1273"></span>[455:58](vp112.htm#fr_1273.md) Vrishabha: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1274"></span>[455:59](vp112.htm#fr_1274.md) Satyahita: Váyu.
Satyahita: Bhágavata. Satyadhrita or Pushya: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1275"></span>[456:60](vp112.htm#fr_1275.md) This story is told
in the 16th section of the Sabhá Parvan of the Mahábhárata, where also
he is called the son of Vrihadratha. In the Váyu he is the son of
Satyahita. The Agni has Satyahita, Urjja, Sambhava, Jarásandha; and the
Matsya, Satyadhrita, Dhanusha, Śarva, Sambhava, Jarásandha.

<span id="fn_1276"></span>[456:61](vp112.htm#fr_1276.md) Somádhi: Váyu.
Udápi: Agni. Udáyus: Bráhma. Somavit: Matsya.

<span id="fn_1277"></span>[456:62](vp112.htm#fr_1277.md) Śrutakarman: Agni.
Śrutaśarman Bráhma.
