*The Vishnu Purana*, translated by Horace Hayman Wilson, \[1840\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

6\. The Naradíya Puráńa

6\. Nárada or Naradíya Puráńa. "Where Nárada has described the duties
which were observed in the Vrihat Kalpa, that, is called the Náradíya,

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

having twenty-five thousand stanzas <span
id="fr_52"></span>[53](#fn_52.md)." If the number of verses be here
correctly stated, the Puráńa has not fallen into my hands. The copy I
have analysed contains not many more than three thousand ślokas. There
is another work, which might be expected to be of greater extent, the
Vrihat Náradíya, or great Nárada Puráńa; but this, according to the
concurrence of three copies in my possession, and of five others in the
Company's library, contains but about three thousand five hundred
verses. It may be doubted, therefore, if the Nárada Puráńa of the Matsya
exists <span id="fr_53"></span>[54](#fn_53.md).

According to the Matsya, the Nárada Puráńa is related by Nárada, and
gives an account of the Vrihat Kalpa. The Náradíya Puráńa is
communicated by Nárada to the Rishis at Naimishárańya, on the Gomati
river. The Vrihannáradíya is related to the same persons, at the same
place, by Súta, as it was told by Nárada to Sanatkumára. Possibly the
term Vrihat may have been suggested by the specification which is given
in the Matsya; but there is no description in it of any particular
Kalpa, or day of Brahmá.

From a cursory examination of these Puráńas, it is very evident that
they have no conformity to the definition of a Puráńa, and that both are
sectarial and modern compilations, intended to support the doctrine of
Bhakti, or faith in Vishńu. With this view they have collected a variety
of prayers addressed to one or other form of that divinity; a number of
observances and holidays connected with his adoration; and different
legends, some perhaps of an early, others of a more recent date,
illustrative of the efficacy of devotion to Hari. Thus in the Nárada we
have the stories of Dhruva and Prahláda; the latter told in the words of
the Vishńu: whilst the second portion of it is occupied with a legend of
Mohiní, the will-born daughter of a king called Rukmángada: beguiled by

<span id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span>

whom, the king offers to perform for her whatever she may desire. She
calls upon him either to violate the rule of fasting on the eleventh day
of the fortnight, a day sacred to Vishńu, or to put his son to death;
and he kills his son, as the lesser sin of the two. This shews the
spirit of the work. Its date may also be inferred from its tenor, as
such monstrous extravagancies in praise of Bhakti are certainly of
modern origin. One limit it furnishes itself, for it refers to Śuka and
Paríkshit, the interlocutors of the Bhágavata, and it is consequently
subsequent to the date of that Puráńa: it is probably considerably
later, for it affords evidence that it was written after India was in
the hands of the Mohammedans. In the concluding passage it is said, "Let
not this Puráńa be repeated in the presence of the 'killers of cows' and
contemners of the gods." It is possibly a compilation of the sixteenth
or seventeenth century.

The Vrihannáradíya is a work of the same tenor and time. It contains
little else than panegyrical prayers addressed to Vishńu, and
injunctions to observe various rites, and keep holy certain seasons, in
honour of him. The earlier legends introduced are the birth of
Márkańd́eya, the destruction of Sagara's sons, and the dwarf Avatára; but
they are subservient to the design of the whole, and are rendered
occasions for praising Náráyańa: others, illustrating the efficacy of
certain Vaishńava observances, are puerile inventions, wholly foreign to
the more ancient system of Pauráńik fiction. There is no attempt at
cosmogony, or patriarchal or regal genealogy. It is possible that these
topics may be treated of in the missing stanzas; but it seems more
likely that the Nárada Puráńa of the lists has little in common with the
works to which its name is applied in Bengal and Hindustan.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[xxxii:54](vp010.htm#fr_53.md) The description of
Vishńu, translated by Col. Vans Kennedy (Affinity of Ancient and Hindu
Mythology, p. 200) from the Náradíya Puráńa, occurs in my copy of the
Vrihat Náradíya. There is no Nárada Puráńa in the East India Company's
library, though, as noticed in the text, several of the Vrihat Náradíya.
There is a copy of the Rukmángada Charitra, said to be a part of the Śri
Nárada Puráńa.
