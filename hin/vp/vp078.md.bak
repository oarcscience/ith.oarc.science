### CHAP. IV.

Division of the Veda, in the last Dwápara age, by the Vyása Krishńa
Dwaipáyana. Paila made reader of the Rich; Vaiśampáyana of the Yajush;
Jaimini of the Shun; and Sumantu of the Atharvan. Súta appointed to
teach the historical poems. Origin of the four parts of the Veda.
Sanhitás of the Rig-veda.

PARÁŚARA.--The original Veda, in four parts, consisted of one hundred
thousand stanzas; and from it sacrifice of ten kinds <span
id="fr_787"></span>[1](#fn_787.md), the accomplisher of all desires,
proceeded. In the twenty-eighth Dwápara age my son Vyása separated the
four portions of the Veda into four Vedas. In the same manner as the
Vedas were arranged by him, as Vedavyása, so were they divided in former
periods by all the preceding Vyásas, and by myself: and the branches
into which they were subdivided by him were the same into which they had
been distributed in every aggregate of the four ages. Know, Maitreya,
the Vyása called Krishńa Dwaipáyana to be the deity Náráyańa; for who
else on this earth could have composed the Mahábhárata <span
id="fr_788"></span>[2](#fn_788.md)? Into what portions the Vedas were
arranged by my magnanimous son, in the Dwápara age, you shall hear.

When Vyása was enjoined by Brahmá to arrange the Vedas in different
books, he took four persons, well read in those works, as his disciples.
He appointed Paila reader of the Rich <span
id="fr_789"></span>[3](#fn_789.md); Vaiśampáyana of

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

the Yajush; and Jaimini of the Soma-veda: and Sumantu, who was
conversant with the Atharva-veda, was also the disciple of the learned
Vyása. He also took Súta, who was named Lomaharshańa, as his pupil in
historical and legendary traditions <span
id="fr_790"></span>[4](#fn_790.md).

There was but one Yajur-veda; but dividing this into four parts, Vyása
instituted the sacrificial rite that is administered by four kinds of
priests: in which it was the duty of the Adhwaryu to recite the prayers
(Yajush) (or direct the ceremony); of the Hotri, to repeat the hymns
(Richas); of the Udgátri, to chaunt other hymns (Sáma); and of the
Brahman, to pronounce the formulæ called Atharva. Then the Muni, having
collected together the hymns called Richas, compiled the Rigveda; with
the prayers and directions termed Yajushas he formed the Yajur-veda;
with those called Sáma, Sáma-veda; and with the Atharvas he composed the
rules of all the ceremonies suited to kings, and the function of the
Brahman agreeably to practice <span id="fr_791"></span>[5](#fn_791.md).

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

This vast original tree of the Vedas, having been divided by him into
four principal stems, soon branched out into an extensive forest. In the
first place, Paila divided the Rig-veda, and gave the two Sanhitás (or
collections of hymns) to Indrapramati and to Báshkali. Báshkali <span
id="fr_792"></span>[6](#fn_792.md) subdivided his Sanhitá into four, which
he gave to his disciples Baudhya, Agnimát́hara, Yajnawalka, and Paráśara;
and they taught these secondary shoots from the primitive branch.
Indrapramati imparted his Sanhitá to his son Mańd́ukeya, and it thence
descended through successive generations, as well as disciples <span
id="fr_793"></span>[7](#fn_793.md). Vedamitra, called also Śákalya, studied
the same Sanhitá, but he divided it into five Sanhitás, which he
distributed amongst as many disciples, named severally Mudgala, Goswalu,
Vátsya, Śálíya, and Śiśira <span id="fr_794"></span>[8](#fn_794.md).
Sákapúrńi made a different division of the original Sanhitá into three
portions, and added a glossary (Nirukta), constituting a fourth <span
id="fr_795"></span>[9](#fn_795.md). The three Sanhitás were given to his
three pupils, Krauncha,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vaitálaki, and
Valáka; and a fourth, (thence named) Niruktakrit, had the glossary <span
id="fr_796"></span>[10](#fn_796.md). In this way branch sprang from branch.
Another Báshkali <span id="fr_797"></span>[11](#fn_797.md) composed three
other Sanhitás, which he taught to his disciples Káláyani, Gárgya, and
Kathájava <span id="fr_798"></span>[12](#fn_798.md). These are they by whom
the principal divisions of the Rich have been promulgated <span
id="fr_799"></span>[13](#fn_799.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_787"></span>[275:1](vp078.htm#fr_787.md) According to the
Grihya portion of the Sáma-veda, there are five great sacrificial
ceremonies; 1. Agnihotra, burnt-offerings, or libations of clarified
butter on sacred fire; 2. Derśapaurńamása, sacrifices at new and full
moon; 3. Cháturmasya, sacrifices every four months; 4. Paśu-yajna or
Aśwamedha, sacrifice of a horse or animal; and 5. Soma-yajna, offerings
and libations of the juice of the acid asclepias. These, again, are
either Prákrita, 'simple,' or Vaikrita, 'modified;' and being thus
doubled, constitute ten.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[275:2](vp078.htm#fr_788.md) The composition of
the Mahábhárata is always ascribed to the Vyása named Krishńa
Dwaipáyana, the cotemporary of the events there described. The allusion
in the text establishes the priority of the poem to the Vishńu Puráńa.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[275:3](vp078.htm#fr_789.md) Or rather, 'he took
Paila as teacher.' The expression is, Rigveda śrávakam Pailam jagráha.
Śrávaka means properly 'he who causes to hear,' 'a lecturer,' 'a
preacher;' although, as in the case of its applicability to the laity of
the Buddhists and Jainas, it <span id="page_276">p. 276</span> denotes a
disciple. The commentator however observes, that the text is sometimes
read 'one who had gone through the Rig-veda.' So in the preceding verse
it is said, 'he took four persons, well read in the Vedas, as his
disciples,' and again it is said, 'Sumantu, conversant with the
Atharva-veda, was his disciple.' It is clear, therefore, that the Vedas
were known, as distinct works, before Krishńa Dwaipáyana; and it is
difficult to understand how he earned his title of arranger, or Vyása:
at any rate, in undertaking to give order to the prayers and hymns of
which the Vedas consist, Paila and the others were rather his coadjutors
than disciples; and it seems probable that the tradition records the
first establishment of a school, of which the Vyása was the head, and
the other persons named were the teachers.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[276:4](vp078.htm#fr_790.md) The Itihása and
Puráńas; understanding by the former, legendary and traditional
narratives. It is usually supposed that by the Itihása the Mahábhárata
is especially meant; but although this poem is ascribed to Krishńa
Dwaipáyana, the recitation of it is not attributed to his pupil, Roma or
Loma-harshańa: it was first narrated by Vaiśampáyana, and after him by
Sauti, the son of Lomaharshańa.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[276:5](vp078.htm#fr_791.md) From this account,
which is repeated in the Váyu P., it appears that the original Veda was
the Yajush, or in other words was a miscellaneous body of precepts,
formulæ, prayers, and hymns, for sacrificial ceremonies; Yajush being
derived by the grammarians from Yaj, 'to worship.' The derivation of the
Váyu Puráńa, however, is from Yuj, 'to join,' 'to employ;' the formulæ
being those especially applied to sacrificial rites, or set apart for
that purpose from the general collection: <span id="page_277">p.
277</span> \#\#\# again, \#\#\# The commentator on the text however,
citing the former of these passages from the Váyu, reads it, confining
the derivation to Yaj, 'to worship.' The concluding passage, relating to
the Atharvan, refers, in regard to regal ceremonies, to those of
expiation, Śánti, &c. The function of the Brahman is not explained; but
from the preceding specification of the four orders of priests who
repeat at sacrifices portions of the several Vedas, it relates to the
office of the one that is termed specifically the Brahman: so the Váyu
has 'He constituted the function of the Brahman at sacrifices with the
Atharva-veda.'

<span id="fn_792"></span>[277:6](vp078.htm#fr_792.md) Both in our text and
in that of the Váyu this name occurs both Báshkala and Báshkali. Mr.
Colebrooke writes it Báhkala and Báhkali. As. Res. VIII. 374.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[277:7](vp078.htm#fr_793.md) The Váyu supplies the
detail. Mańd́ukeya, or, as one copy writes, Márkańd́eya, taught the
Sanhitá to his son Satyaśravas; he to his son Satyahita; and he to his
son Satyaśrí. The latter had three pupils, Śákalya, also called
Devamitra (sic in MS.), Rathántara, and another Báshkali, called also
Bharadwája. The Váyu has a legend of Śákalya's death, in consequence of
his being defeated by Yájnavalkya in a disputation at a sacrifice
celebrated by Janaka.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[277:8](vp078.htm#fr_794.md) These names in the
Váyu are Mudgala, Golaka, Kháliya, Mátsya, Śaiśireya.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[277:9](vp078.htm#fr_795.md) The commentator, who
is here followed by Mr. Colebrooke, states that he was a pupil of
Indrapramati; but from the Váyu it appears that Śákapúrńi was another
name of Rathántara, the pupil of Satyaśrí, the author of three Sanhitás
and a Nirukta, or glossary; whence Mr. Colebrooke supposes him the same
with Yáska. As. Res. VIII. 375. It is highly probable that the text of
the Váyu may be made to correct that of the Vishńu in this place, which
is inaccurate, notwithstanding the copies agree: they read, \#\#\#.
<span id="page_278">p. 278</span> Here Śákapúrńir-atha-itaram is the
necessary construction; but quere if it should not be Śákapúrńi
Rathántara. The parallel passage in the Váyu is, \#\#\#. Now in
describing the pupils of Satyaśrí, Rathántara was named clearly enough:
\#\#\#. In another passage it would seem to be implied that this
Báshkali was the author of the Sanhitás, and Rathántara of the Nirukta
only: \#\#\#. However this may be, his being the author of the Nirukta
identifies him with Śákapúrńi, and makes it likely that the two names
should come in juxta-position in our text, as well as in the Váyu. It
must be admitted, however, that there are some rather inexplicable
repetitions in the part of the Váyu where this account occurs, although
two copies agree in the reading. That a portion of the Vedas goes by the
name of Rathantara we have seen ([p. 42](vp039.htm#page_42).md); but as far
as is yet known, the name is confined to different prayers or hymns of
the Uhya Gána of the Sáma-veda. The text of the Vishńu also admits of a
different explanation regarding the work of Śákapúrńi, and instead of a
threefold division of the original, the passage may mean that he
composed a third Sanhitá. So Mr. Colebrooke says "the Vishńu P. omits
the Śákhás of Aśwaláyana and Sánkhyáyana, and intimates that Śákapúrńi
gave the third varied edition from that of Indrapramati." The Váyu,
however, is clear in ascribing three Sanhitás or Śákhás to Śákapúrńi.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[278:10](vp078.htm#fr_796.md) In the Váyu the four
pupils of Sákapúrńi are called Kenava, Dálaki, Śatavaláka, and Naigama.

<span id="fn_797"></span>[278:11](vp078.htm#fr_797.md) This Báshkali may
either be, according to the commentator, the pupil of Paila, who, in
addition to the four Sanhitás previously noticed, compiled three others;
or he may be another Báshkali, a fellow-pupil of Śákapúrni. The Váyu
makes him a disciple of Satyaśrí, the fellow-pupil of Śákalya and
Rathántara, and adds the name or title Bháradwája.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[278:12](vp078.htm#fr_798.md) In the Váyu they are
called Nandáyaníya, Pannagári, and Árjjava.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[278:13](vp078.htm#fr_799.md) Both the Vishńu and
Váyu Puráńas omit two other principal divisions of the Rich, those of
Aśwaláyana and Sánkhyáyana or the Kauśítakí. As. Res. VIII. 375. There
is no specification of the aggregate number of Sanhitás of the Rich in
our text, or in the Váyu; but they describe eighteen, including the
Nirukta; or as Mr. Colebrooke states, sixteen (As. Res. VIII. 374); that
is, omitting the two portions of the original, as divided by Paila. The
Kúrma Puráńa states the number at twenty-one; but treatises on the study
of the Vedas reduce the Śákhás of the Rich to five.
