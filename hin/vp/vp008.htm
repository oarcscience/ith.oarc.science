<p>4. "The Pur&aacute;n&#769;a in which V&aacute;yu has declared the laws of duty, in connexion with the Sweta Kalpa, and which comprises the M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya of Rudra, is the V&aacute;yav&iacute;ya Pur&aacute;n&#769;a: it contains twenty-four thousand verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A>." The &#346;iva or &#346;aiva Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is, as above remarked, omitted in some of the lists; and in general, when that is the case, it is replaced by the V&aacute;yu or V&aacute;yav&iacute;ya. When the &#346;iva is specified, as in the Bh&aacute;gavata, then the V&aacute;yu is omitted; intimating the possible identity of these two works. This indeed is confirmed by the Matsya, which describes the V&aacute;yav&iacute;ya Pur&aacute;n&#769;a as characterised by its account of the greatness of Rudra or Siva&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A>; and Balambhat&#769;t&#769;a mentions that the V&aacute;yav&iacute;ya is also called the &#346;aiva, though, according to some, the latter is the name of an Upa-pur&aacute;n&#769;a. Col. Vans Kennedy observes, that in the west of India the &#346;aiva is commonly considered to be an Upa or 'minor' Pur&aacute;n&#769;a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Another proof that the same work is intended by the authorities here followed, the Bh&aacute;gavata and Matsya, under different appellations, is their concurrence in the extent of the work, each specifying its verses to be twenty-four thousand. A copy of the &#346;iva Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, of which an index and analysis have been prepared, does not contain more than about seven thousand: it cannot therefore be the &#346;iva Pur&aacute;n&#769;a of the Bh&aacute;gavata; and we may safely consider that to be the same as the V&aacute;yav&iacute;ya of the Matsya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>The V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;a is narrated by S&uacute;ta to the Rishis at Naimish&aacute;ran&#769;ya, as it was formerly told at the same place to similar persons by V&aacute;yu; a repetition of circumstances not uncharacteristic of the inartificial style of this Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. It is divided into four P&aacute;das, termed severally Prakriy&aacute;, Upodgh&aacute;ta, Anushanga, and Upasanh&aacute;ra; a classification peculiar to this work. These are preceded by an index, or heads of chapters, in the manner of the Mah&aacute;bh&aacute;rata and R&aacute;m&aacute;yan&#769;a; another peculiarity.</p>  
<p>The Prakriy&aacute; portion contains but a few chapters, and treats chiefly</p>

<p>of elemental creation, and the first evolutions of beings, to the same purport as the Vishn&#769;u, but in a more obscure and unmethodical style. The Upodgh&aacute;ta then continues the subject of creation, and describes the various Kalpas or periods during which the world has existed; a greater number of which is specified by the &#346;aiva than by the Vaishn&#769;ava Pur&aacute;n&#769;as. Thirty-three are here described, the last of which is the Sweta or 'white' Kalpa, from &#346;iva's being born in it of a white complexion. The genealogies of the patriarchs, the description of the universe, and the incidents of the first six Manwantaras, are all treated of in this part of the work; but they are intermixed with legends and praises of &#346;iva, as the sacrifice of Daksha, the Mahe&#347;wara M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya, the Nilak&aacute;ntha Stotra, and others. The genealogies, although in the main the same as those in the Vaishn&#769;ava Pur&aacute;n&#769;as, present some variations. A long account of the Pitris or progenitors is also peculiar to this Pur&aacute;n&#769;a; as are stories of some of the most celebrated Rishis, who were engaged in the distribution of the Vedas.</p>  
<p>The third division commences with an account of the seven Rishis and their descendants, and describes the origin of the different classes of creatures from the daughters of Daksha, with a profuse copiousness of nomenclature, not found in any other Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. With exception of the greater minuteness of detail, the particulars agree with those of the Vishn&#769;u P. A chapter then occurs on the worship of the Pitris; another on T&iacute;rthas, or places sacred to them; and several on the performance of Sr&aacute;ddhas, constituting the Sr&aacute;ddha Kalpa. After this, comes a full account of the solar and lunar dynasties, forming a parallel to that in the following pages, with this difference, that it is throughout in verse, whilst that of our text, as noticed in its place, is chiefly in prose. It is extended also by the insertion of detailed accounts of various incidents, briefly noticed in the Vishn&#769;u, though derived apparently from a common original. The section terminates with similar accounts of future kings, and the same chronological calculations, that are found in the Vishn&#769;u.</p>  
<p>The last portion, the Upasanh&aacute;ra, describes briefly the future Manwantaras, the measures of space and time, the end of the world, the</p>  
<p><a name="page_xxiv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xxiv</font></A></p>  
<p>efficacy of Yoga, and the glories of &#346;iva-pura, or the dwelling of &#346;iva, with whom the Yogi is to be united. The manuscript concludes with a different history of the successive teachers of the V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;a, tracing them from Brahm&aacute; to V&aacute;yu, from V&aacute;yu to Vrihaspati, and from him, through various deities and sages, to Dwaip&aacute;yan&#769;a and &#346;&uacute;ta.</p>  
<p>The account given of this Pur&aacute;n&#769;a in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal was limited to something less than half the work, as I had not then been able to procure a larger portion. I have now a more complete one of my own, and there are several copies in the East India Company's library of the like extent. One, presented by His Highness the Guicowar, is dated Samvat 1540, or A. D. 1483, and is evidently as old as it professes to be. The examination I have made of the work confirms the view I formerly took of it; and from the internal evidence it affords, it may perhaps be regarded as one of the oldest and most authentic specimens extant of a primitive Pur&aacute;n&#769;a.</p>  
<p>It appears, however, that we have not yet a copy of the entire V&aacute;yu Pur&aacute;n&#769;a. The extent of it, as mentioned above, should be twenty-four thousand verses. The Guicowar MS. has but twelve thousand, and is denominated the P&uacute;rv&aacute;rddha, or first portion. My copy is of the like extent. The index also spews that several subjects remain untold; as, subsequently to the description of the sphere of &#346;iva, and the periodical dissolution of the world, the work is said to contain an account of a succeeding creation, and of various events that occurred in it, as the birth of several celebrated Rishis, including that of Vy&aacute;sa, and a description of his distribution of the Vedas; an account of the enmity between Va&#347;isht&#769;ha and Visw&aacute;mitra; and a Naimish&aacute;ran&#769;ya M&aacute;h&aacute;tmya. These topics are, however, of minor importance, and can scarcely carry the Pur&aacute;n&#769;a to the whole extent of the verses which it is said to contain. If the number is accurate, the index must still omit a considerable portion of the subsequent contents.</p>
