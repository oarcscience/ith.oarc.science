Book One

The first book of the six, into which the work is divided, is occupied
chiefly with the details of creation, primary (Sarga) and secondary
(Pratisarga); the first explaining how the universe proceeds from
Prakriti, or eternal crude matter; the second, in what manner the forms
of things are developed from the elementary substances previously
evolved, or how they reappear after their temporary destruction. Both
these creations are periodical, but the termination of the first occurs
only at the end of the life of Brahmá, when not only all the gods and
all other forms are annihilated, but the elements are again merged into
primary substance, besides which one only spiritual being exists: the
latter takes place at the end of every Kalpa, or day of Brahmá, and
affects only the forms of inferior creatures, and lower worlds, leaving
the substance of the universe entire, and sages and gods unharmed. The
explanation of these events involves a description of the periods of
time upon which they depend. and which are accordingly detailed. Their
character has been a source of very unnecessary perplexity to European
writers, as they belong to a scheme of chronology wholly mythological,
having no reference to any real or supposed history of the Hindus, but
applicable, according to their system, to the infinite and eternal
revolutions of the universe. In these notions, and in that of the
coeternity of spirit and matter, the theogony and cosmogony of the
Puráńas, as they appear in the Vishńu Puráńa,

<span id="page_lx">p. lx</span>

belong to and illustrate systems of high antiquity, of which we have
only fragmentary traces in the records of other nations.

The course of the elemental creation is in the Vishńu, as in other
Puráńas, taken from the Sánkhya philosophy; but the agency that operates
upon passive matter is confusedly exhibited, in consequence of a partial
adoption of the illusory theory of the Vedánta philosophy, and the
prevalence of the Pauráńik doctrine of Pantheism. However incompatible
with the independent existence of Pradhána or crude matter, and however
incongruous with the separate condition of pure spirit or Purusha, it is
declared repeatedly that Vishńu, as one with the supreme being, is not
only spirit, but crude matter; and not only the latter, but all visible
substance, and Time. He is Purusha, 'spirit;' Pradhána, crude matter;
'Vyakta, 'visible form;' and Kula, 'time.' This cannot but be regarded
as a departure from the primitive dogmas of the Hindus, in which the
distinctness of the Deity and his works was enunciated; in which upon
his willing the world to be, it was; and in which his interposition in
creation, held to be inconsistent with the quiescence of perfection, was
explained away by the personification of attributes in action, which
afterwards came to be considered as real divinities, Brahmá, Vishńu, and
Śiva, charged severally for a given season with the creation,
preservation, and temporary annihilation of material forms. These
divinities are in the following pages, consistently with the tendency of
a Vaishńava work, declared to be no other than Vishńu. In Śaiva Puráńas
they are in like manner identified with Śiva. The Puráńas thus
displaying and explaining the seeming incompatibility, of which there
are traces in other ancient mythologies, between three distinct
hypostases of one superior deity, and the identification of one or other
of those hypostases with their common and separate original.

After the world has been fitted for the reception of living creatures,
it is peopled by the will-engendered sons of Brahmá, the Prajápatis or
patriarchs, and their posterity. It would seem as if a primitive
tradition of the descent of mankind from seven holy personages had at
first prevailed, but that in the course of time it had been expanded
into complicated, and not always consistent, amplification, How could
these Rishis

<span id="page_lxi">p. lxi</span>

or patriarchs have posterity? it was necessary to provide them with
wives. In order to account for their existence, the Manu Swáyambhuva and
his wife Satarupá were added to the scheme, or Brahmá becomes twofold,
male and female, and daughters are then begotten, who are married to the
Prajápatis. Upon this basis various legends of Brahma's double nature,
some no doubt as old as the Vedas, have been constructed: but although
they may have been derived in some degree from the authentic tradition
of the origin of mankind from a single pair, yet the circumstances
intended to give more interest and precision to the story are evidently
of an allegorical or mystical description, and conduced, in apparently
later times, to a coarseness of realization which was neither the letter
nor spirit of the original legend. Swáyambhuva, the son of the self-born
or untreated, and his wife Satarupá, the hundred-formed or multiform,
are themselves allegories; and their female descendants, who become the
wives of the Rishis, are Faith, Devotion, Content, Intelligence,
Tradition, and the like; whilst amongst their posterity we have the
different phases of the moon, and the sacrificial fires. In another
creation the chief source of creatures is the patriarch Daksha
(ability), whose daughters, Virtues or Passions or Astronomical
Phenomena, are the mothers of all existing things. These legends,
perplexed as they appear to be, seem to admit of allowable solution, in
the conjecture that the Prajápatis and Rishis were real personages, the
authors of the Hindu system of social, moral, and religious obligations,
and the first observers of the heavens, and teachers of astronomical
science.

The regal personages of the Swáyambhuva Manwantara are but few, but they
are described in the outset as governing the earth in the dawn of
society, and as introducing agriculture and civilisation. How much of
their story rests upon a traditional remembrance of their actions, it
would be useless to conjecture, although there is no extravagance in
supposing that the legends relate to a period prior to the full
establishment in India of the Brahmanical institutions. The legends of
Dhruva and Prahláda, which are intermingled with these particulars, are
in all probability ancient, but they are amplified, in a strain
conformable to the Vaishńava purport of this Puráńa, by doctrines and
prayers asserting the

<span id="page_lxii">p. lxii</span>

identity of Vishńu with the supreme. It is clear that the stories do not
originate with this Puráńa. In that of Prahláda particularly, as
hereafter pointed out, circumstances essential to the completeness of
the story are only alluded to, not recounted; shewing indisputably the
writer's having availed himself of some prior authority for his
narration.
