# INTRODUCTION

### KALIDASA--HIS LIFE AND WRITINGS

### I

KALIDASA probably lived in the fifth century of the Christian era. This
date, approximate as it is, must yet be given with considerable
hesitation, and is by no means certain. No truly biographical data are
preserved about the author, who nevertheless enjoyed a great popularity
during his life, and whom the Hindus have ever regarded as the greatest
of Sanskrit poets. We are thus confronted with one of the remarkable
problems of literary history. For our ignorance is not due to neglect of
Kalidasa's writings on the part of his countrymen, but to their strange
blindness in regard to the interest and importance of historic fact. No
European nation can compare with India in critical devotion to its own
literature. During a period to be reckoned not by centuries but by
millenniums, there has been in India an unbroken line of savants
unselfishly dedicated to the perpetuation and exegesis of the native
masterpieces. Editions, recensions, commentaries abound; poets have
sought the exact phrase of appreciation for their predecessors: yet when
we seek to reconstruct the life of their greatest poet, we have no
materials except certain tantalising legends, and such data as we can
gather from the writings of a man who hardly mentions himself.

One of these legends deserves to be recounted for its intrinsic
interest, although it contains, so far as we can see, no grain of
historic truth, and although it places Kalidasa in Benares, five hundred
miles distant from the only city in which we certainly know that he
spent a part of his life. According to this account, Kalidasa was a
Brahman's child. At the age of six months he was left an orphan and was
adopted by an ox-driver. He grew to manhood

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

without formal education, yet with remarkable beauty and grace of
manner. Now it happened that the Princess of Benares was a
blue-stocking, who rejected one suitor  after another, among them her
father's counsellor, because they failed to reach her standard as
scholars and poets. The rejected counsellor planned a cruel revenge. He
took the handsome ox-driver from the street, gave him the garments of a
savant and a retinue of learned doctors, then introduced him to the
princess, after warning him that he was under no circumstances to open
his lips. The princess was struck with his beauty and smitten to the
depths of her pedantic soul by his obstinate silence, which seemed to
her, as indeed it was, an evidence of profound wisdom. She desired to
marry Kalidasa, and together they went to the temple. But no sooner was
the ceremony performed than Kalidasa perceived an image of a bull. His
early training was too much for him; the secret came out, and the bride
was furious. But she relented in response to Kalidasa's entreaties, and
advised him to pray for learning and poetry to the goddess Kali. The
prayer was granted; education and poetical power descended miraculously
to dwell with the young ox-driver, who in gratitude assumed the name
Kalidasa, servant of Kali. Feeling that he owed this happy change in his
very nature to his princess, he swore that he would ever treat her as
his teacher, with profound respect but without familiarity. This was
more than the lady had bargained for; her anger burst forth anew, and
she cursed Kalidasa to meet his death at the hands of a woman. At a
later date, the story continues, this curse was fulfilled. A certain
king had written a half-stanza of verse, and had offered a large reward
to any poet who could worthily complete it. Kalidasa completed the
stanza without difficulty; but a woman whom he loved discovered his
lines, and greedy of the reward herself, killed him.

Another legend represents Kalidasa as engaging in a pilgrimage to a
shrine of Vishnu in Southern India, in company with two other famous
writers, Bhavabhuti and Dandin. Yet another pictures Bhavabhuti as a
contemporary of Kalidasa, and jealous of the less austere poet's
reputation. These stories must be untrue, for it is

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

certain that the three authors were not contemporary, yet they show a
true instinct in the belief that genius seeks genius, and is rarely
isolated.

This instinctive belief has been at work with the stories which connect
Kalidasa with King Vikramaditya and the literary figures of his court.
It has doubtless enlarged, perhaps partly falsified the facts; yet we
cannot doubt that there is truth in this tradition, late though it be,
and impossible though it may ever be to separate the actual from the
fanciful. Here then we are on firmer ground. King Vikramaditya ruled in
the city of Ujjain, in West-central India. He was mighty both in war and
in peace, winning especial glory by a decisive victory over the
barbarians who pressed into India through the northern passes. Though it
has not proved possible to identify this monarch with any of the known
rulers, there can be no doubt that he existed and had the character
attributed to him. The name Vikramaditya--Sun of Valour--is probably not
a proper name, but a title like Pharaoh or Tsar. No doubt Kalidasa
intended to pay a tribute to his patron, the Sun of Valour, in the very
title of his play, *Urvashi won by Valour*.

King Vikramaditya was a great patron of learning and of poetry. Ujjain
during his reign was the most brilliant capital in the world, nor has it
to this day lost all the lustre shed upon it by that splendid court.
Among the eminent men gathered there, nine were particularly
distinguished, and these nine are known as the "nine gems." Some of the
nine gems were poets, others represented science--astronomy, medicine,
lexicography. It is quite true that the details of this late tradition
concerning the nine gems are open to suspicion, yet the central fact is
not doubtful: that there was at this time and place a great quickening
of the human mind, an artistic impulse creating works that cannot
perish. Ujjain in the days of Vikramaditya stands worthily beside
Athens, Rome, Florence, and London in their great centuries. Here is the
substantial fact behind Max Müller's often ridiculed theory of the
renaissance of Sanskrit literature. It is quite false to suppose, as
some appear to do, that this theory has been invalidated by the
discovery of certain literary products

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

which antedate Kalidasa. It might even be said that those rare and happy
centuries that see a man as great as Homer or Vergil or Kalidasa or
Shakespeare partake in that one man of a renaissance.

It is interesting to observe that the centuries of intellectual darkness
in Europe have sometimes coincided with centuries of light in India. The
Vedas were composed for the most part before Homer; Kalidasa and his
contemporaries lived while Rome was tottering under barbarian assault.

To the scanty and uncertain data of late traditions may be added some
information about Kalidasa's life gathered from his own writings. He
mentions his own name only in the prologues to his three plays, and here
with a modesty that is charming indeed, yet tantalising. One wishes for
a portion of the communicativeness that characterises  some of the
Indian poets. He speaks in the first person only once, in the verses
introductory to his epic poem *The Dynasty of Raghu*. <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) Here also we feel his modesty, and here once
more we are balked of details as to his life.

We know from Kalidasa's writings that he spent at least a part of his
life in the city of Ujjain. He refers to Ujjain more than once, and in a
manner hardly possible to one who did not know and love the city.
Especially in his poem *The Cloud-Messenger* does he dwell upon the
city's charms, and even bids the cloud make a detour in his long journey
lest he should miss making its acquaintance. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)

We learn further that Kalidasa travelled widely in India. The fourth
canto of *The Dynasty of Raghu* describes a tour about the whole of
India and even into regions which are beyond the borders of a narrowly
measured India. It is hard to believe that Kalidasa had not himself made
such a "grand tour"; so much of truth there may be in the tradition
which sends him on a pilgrimage to Southern India. The thirteenth canto
of the same epic and *The Cloud-Messenger* also describe long journeys
over India, for the most part through regions far from Ujjain. It is the
mountains which impress him most deeply. His works are full of the
Himalayas. Apart from his earliest

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

drama and the slight poem called *The Seasons*, there is not one of them
which is not fairly redolent of mountains. One, *The Birth of the
War-god*, might be said to be all mountains. Nor was it only Himalayan
grandeur and sublimity which attracted him; for, as a Hindu critic has
acutely observed, he is the only Sanskrit poet who has described a
certain flower that grows in Kashmir. The sea interested him less. To
him, as to most Hindus, the ocean was a beautiful, terrible barrier, not
a highway to adventure. The "sea-belted earth" of which Kalidasa speaks
means to him the mainland of India.

Another conclusion that may be certainly drawn from Kalidasa's writing
is this, that he was a man of sound and rather extensive education. He
was not indeed a prodigy of learning, like Bhavabhuti in his own country
or Milton in England, yet no man could write as he did without hard and
intelligent study. To begin with, he had a minutely accurate knowledge
of the Sanskrit language, at a time when Sanskrit was to some extent an
artificial tongue. Somewhat too much stress is often laid upon this
point, as if the writers of the classical period in India were composing
in a foreign language. Every writer, especially every poet, composing in
any language, writes in what may be called a strange idiom; that is, he
does not write as he talks. Yet it is true that the gap between written
language and vernacular was wider in Kalidasa's day than it has often
been. The Hindus themselves regard twelve years' study as requisite for
the mastery of the "chief of all sciences, the science of grammar." That
Kalidasa had mastered this science his works bear abundant witness.

He likewise mastered the works on rhetoric and dramatic theory--subjects
which Hindu savants have treated with great, if sometimes
hair-splitting, ingenuity. The profound and subtle systems of philosophy
were also possessed by Kalidasa, and he had some knowledge of astronomy
and law.

But it was not only in written books that Kalidasa was deeply read.
Rarely has a man walked our earth who observed the phenomena of living
nature as accurately as he, though his accuracy was of course that of
the poet, not that of the scientist. Much is lost to us who grow up

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

among other animals and plants; yet we can appreciate his "bee-black
hair," his ashoka-tree that "sheds his blossoms in a rain of tears," his
river wearing a sombre veil of mist:

Although her reeds seem hands that clutch the dress  
To hide her charms;

his picture of the day-blooming water-lily at sunset:

The water-lily closes, but  
With wonderful reluctancy;  
As if it troubled her to shut  
Her door of welcome to the bee.

The religion of any great poet is always a matter of interest,
especially the religion of a Hindu poet; for the Hindus have ever been a
deeply and creatively religious people. So far as we can judge, Kalidasa
moved among the jarring sects with sympathy for all, fanaticism for
none. The dedicatory prayers that introduce his dramas are addressed to
Shiva. This is hardly more than a convention, for Shiva is the patron of
literature. If one of his epics, *The Birth of the War-god*, is
distinctively Shivaistic, the other, *The Dynasty of Raghu*, is no less
Vishnuite in tendency. If the hymn to Vishnu in *The Dynasty of Raghu*
is an expression of Vedantic monism, the hymn to Brahma in *The Birth of
the War-god* gives equally clear expression to the rival dualism of the
Sankhya system. Nor are the Yoga doctrine and Buddhism left without
sympathetic mention. We are therefore justified in concluding that
Kalidasa was, in matters of religion, what William James would call
"healthy-minded," emphatically not a "sick soul."

There are certain other impressions of Kalidasa's life and personality
which gradually become convictions in the mind of one who reads and
re-reads his poetry, though they are less easily susceptible of exact
proof. One feels certain that he was physically handsome, and the
handsome Hindu is a wonderfully fine type of manhood. One knows that he
possessed a fascination for women, as they in turn fascinated him. One
knows that children loved him. One becomes convinced that he never
suffered any morbid, soul-shaking experience such as besetting religious

<span id="page_xiii">p. xiii</span>

doubt brings with it, or the pangs of despised love; that on the
contrary he moved among men and women with a serene and godlike tread,
neither self-indulgent nor ascetic, with mind and senses ever alert to
every form of beauty. We know that his poetry was popular while he
lived, and we cannot doubt that his personality was equally attractive,
though it is probable that no contemporary knew the full measure of his
greatness. For his nature was one of singular balance, equally at home
in a splendid court and on a lonely mountain, with men of high and of
low degree. Such men are never fully appreciated during life. They
continue to grow after they are dead.

### II

Kalidasa left seven works which have come down to us: three dramas, two
epics, one elegiac poem, and one descriptive poem. Many other works,
including even an astronomical treatise, have been attributed to him;
they are certainly not his. Perhaps there was more than one author who
bore the name Kalidasa; perhaps certain later writers were more
concerned for their work than for personal fame. On the other hand,
there is no reason to doubt that the seven recognised works are in truth
from Kalidasa's hand. The only one concerning which there is reasonable
room for suspicion is the short poem descriptive of the seasons, and
this is fortunately the least important of the seven. Nor is there
evidence to show that any considerable poem has been lost, unless it be
true that the concluding cantos of one of the epics have perished. We
are thus in a fortunate position in reading Kalidasa: we have
substantially all that he wrote, and run no risk of ascribing to him any
considerable work from another hand.

Of these seven works, four are poetry throughout; the three dramas, like
all Sanskrit dramas, are written in prose, with a generous mingling of
lyric and descriptive stanzas. The poetry, even in the epics, is
stanzaic; no part of it can fairly be compared to English blank verse.
Classical Sanskrit verse, so far as structure is concerned, has much in
common with familiar Greek and Latin forms:

<span id="page_xiv">p. xiv</span>

it makes no systematic use of rhyme; it depends for its rhythm not upon
accent, but upon quantity. The natural medium of translation into
English seems to me to be the rhymed stanza; <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) in the present work the rhymed stanza has
been used, with a consistency perhaps too rigid, wherever the original
is in verse.

Kalidasa's three dramas bear the names: *Malavika and Agnimitra*,
*Urvashi*, and *Shakuntala*. The two epics are *The Dynasty of Raghu*
and *The Birth of the War-god*. The elegiac poem is called *The
Cloud-Messenge*r, and the descriptive poem is entitled *The Seasons*. It
may be well to state briefly the more salient features of the Sanskrit
genres to which these works belong.

The drama proved in India, as in other countries, a congenial form to
many of the most eminent poets. The Indian drama has a marked
individuality, but stands nearer to the modern European theatre than to
that of ancient Greece; for the plays, with a very few exceptions, have
no religious significance, and deal with love between man and woman.
Although tragic elements may be present, a tragic ending is forbidden.
Indeed, nothing regarded as disagreeable, such as fighting or even
kissing, is permitted on the stage; here Europe may perhaps learn a
lesson in taste. Stage properties were few and simple, while particular
care was lavished on the music. The female parts were played by women.
The plays very rarely have long monologues, even the inevitable prologue
being divided between two speakers, but a Hindu audience was tolerant of
lyrical digression.

It may be said, though the statement needs qualification in both
directions, that the Indian dramas have less action and less
individuality in the characters, but more poetical charm than the dramas
of modern Europe.

On the whole, Kalidasa was remarkably faithful to the ingenious but
somewhat over-elaborate conventions of Indian dramaturgy. His first
play, the *Malavika and Agnimitra*, is entirely conventional in plot.
The *Shakuntala* is transfigured by the character of the heroine. The
*Urvashi*, in spite of detail beauty, marks a distinct decline.

<span id="page_xv">p. xv</span>

*The Dynasty of Raghu* and *The Birth of the War-god* belong to a
species of composition which it is not easy to name accurately. The
Hindu name *kavya* has been rendered by artificial epic, *épopée
savante*, *Kunstgedicht*. It is best perhaps to use the term epic, and
to qualify the term by explanation.

The *kavyas* differ widely from the *Mahabharata* and the *Ramayana*,
epics which resemble the *Iliad* and *Odyssey* less in outward form than
in their character as truly national poems. The kavya is a narrative
poem written in a sophisticated age by a learned poet, who possesses all
the resources of an elaborate rhetoric and metric. The subject is drawn
from time-honoured mythology. The poem is divided into cantos, written
not in blank verse but in stanzas. Several stanza-forms are commonly
employed in the same poem, though not in the same canto, except that the
concluding verses of a canto are not infrequently written in a metre of
more compass than the remainder.

I have called *The Cloud-Messenger* an elegiac poem, though it would not
perhaps meet the test of a rigid definition. The Hindus class it with
*The Dynasty of Raghu* and *The Birth of the War-god* as a *kavya*, but
this classification simply evidences their embarrassment. In fact,
Kalidasa created in *The Cloud-Messenger* a new genre. No further
explanation is needed here, as the entire poem is translated below.

The short descriptive poem called *The Season*s has abundant analogues
in other literatures, and requires no comment.

It is not possible to fix the chronology of Kalidasa's writings, yet we
are not wholly in the dark. *Malavika and Agnimitr*a was certainly his
first drama, almost certainly his first work. It is a reasonable
conjecture, though nothing more, that Urvashi was written late, when the
poet's powers were waning. The introductory stanzas of *The Dynasty of
Raghu* suggest that this epic was written before *The Birth of the
War-god*, though the inference is far from certain. Again, it is
reasonable to assume that the great works on which Kalidasa's fame
chiefly rests--*Shakuntala*, *The Cloud-Messenger*, *The Dynasty of
Raghu*,

<span id="page_xvi">p. xvi</span>

the first eight cantos of *The Birth of the War-god*--were composed when
he was in the prime of manhood. But as to the succession of these four
works we can do little but guess.

Kalidasa's glory depends primarily upon the quality of his work, yet
would be much diminished if he had failed in bulk and variety. In India,
more than would be the case in Europe, the extent of his writing is an
indication of originality and power; for the poets of the classical
period underwent an education that encouraged an exaggerated
fastidiousness, and they wrote for a public meticulously critical. Thus
the great Bhavabhuti spent his life in constructing three dramas; mighty
spirit though he was, he yet suffers from the very scrupulosity of his
labour. In this matter, as in others, Kalidasa preserves his
intellectual balance and his spiritual initiative: what greatness of
soul is required for this, every one knows who has ever had the
misfortune to differ in opinion from an intellectual clique.

### III

Le nom de Kâlidâsa domine la poésie indienne et la résume brillamment.
Le drame, l’épopée savante, l’élégie attestent aujourd’hui encore la
puissance et la souplesse de ce magnifique génie; seul entre les
disciples de Sarasvatî \[the goddess of eloquence\], il a eu le bonheur
de produire un chef-d’œuvre vraiment classique, où l’Inde s’admire et où
l’humanité se reconnaît. Les applaudissements qui saluèrent la naissance
de Çakuntalâ à Ujjayinî ont après de longs siècles éclaté d’un bout du
monde à l’autre, quand William Jones l’eut révélée à l’Occident.
Kâlidâsa a marqué sa place dans cette pléiade étincelante où chaque nom
résume une période de l’esprit humain. La série de ces noms forme
l’histoire, ou plutôt elle est l’histoire même. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)

It is hardly possible to say anything true about Kalidasa's achievement
which is not already contained in this appreciation. Yet one loves to
expand the praise, even though realising that the critic is by his very
nature a fool. Here

<span id="page_xvii">p. xvii</span>

there shall at any rate be none of that cold-blooded criticism which
imagines itself set above a world-author to appraise and judge, but a
generous tribute of affectionate admiration.

The best proof of a poet's greatness is the inability of men to live
without him; in other words, his power to win and hold through centuries
the love and admiration of his own people, especially when that people
has shown itself capable of high intellectual and spiritual achievement.

For something like fifteen hundred years, Kalidasa has been more widely
read in India than any other author who wrote in Sanskrit. There have
also been many attempts to express in words the secret of his abiding
power: such attempts can never be wholly successful, yet they are not
without considerable interest. Thus Bana, a celebrated novelist of the
seventh century, has the following lines in some stanzas of poetical
criticism which he prefixes to a historical romance:

Where find a soul that does not thrill  
   In Kalidasa's verse to meet  
The smooth, inevitable lines  
   Like blossom-clusters, honey-sweet?

A later writer, speaking of Kalidasa and another poet, is more laconic
in this alliterative line: *Bhaso hasah, Kalidaso vilasah*--Bhasa is
mirth, Kalidasa is grace.

These two critics see Kalidasa's grace, his sweetness, his delicate
taste, without doing justice to the massive quality without which his
poetry could not have survived.

Though Kalidasa has not been as widely appreciated in Europe as he
deserves, he is the only Sanskrit poet who can properly be said to have
been appreciated at all. Here he must struggle with the truly Himalayan
barrier of language. Since there will never be many Europeans, even
among the cultivated, who will find it possible to study the intricate
Sanskrit language, there remains only one means of presentation. None
knows the cruel inadequacy of poetical translation like the translator.
He understands better than others can, the significance of the position
which Kalidasa has won in Europe. When Sir William Jones first
translated the *Shakuntala* in 1789, his work was enthusiastically
received in Europe, and most warmly, as was fitting, by the greatest
living poet of

<span id="page_xviii">p. xviii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Europe. Since that day, as is testified by new
translations and by reprints of the old, there have been many thousands
who have read at least one of Kalidasa's works; other thousands have
seen it on the stage in Europe and America.

How explain a reputation that maintains itself indefinitely and that
conquers a new continent after a lapse of thirteen hundred years? None
can explain it, yet certain contributory causes can be named.

No other poet in any land has sung of happy love between man and woman
as Kalidasa sang. Every one of his works is a love-poem, however much
more it may be. Yet the theme is so infinitely varied that the reader
never wearies. If one were to doubt from a study of European literature,
comparing the ancient classics with modern works, whether romantic love
be the expression of a natural instinct, be not rather a morbid survival
of decaying chivalry, he has only to turn to India's independently
growing literature to find the question settled. Kalidasa's love-poetry
rings as true in our ears as it did in his countrymen's ears fifteen
hundred years ago.

It is of love eventually happy, though often struggling for a time
against external obstacles, that Kalidasa writes. There is nowhere in
his works a trace of that not quite healthy feeling that sometimes
assumes the name "modern love." If it were not so, his poetry could
hardly have survived; for happy love, blessed with children, is surely
the more fundamental thing. In his drama *Urvashi* he is ready to change
and greatly injure a tragic story, given him by long tradition, in order
that a loving pair may not be permanently separated. One apparent
exception there is--the story of Rama and Sita in *The Dynasty of
Raghu*. In this case it must be remembered that Rama is an incarnation
of Vishnu, and the story of a mighty god incarnate is not to be lightly
tampered with.

It is perhaps an inevitable consequence of Kalidasa's subject that his
women appeal more strongly to a modern reader than his men. The man is
the more variable phenomenon, and though manly virtues are the same in
all countries and centuries, the emphasis has been variously laid. But
the true woman seems timeless, universal. I know of no poet, unless it
be Shakespeare, who has given

<span id="page_xix">p. xix</span>

the world a group of heroines so individual yet so universal; heroines
as true, as tender, as brave as are Indumati, Sita, Parvati, the
Yaksha's bride, and Shakuntala.

Kalidasa could not understand women without understanding children. It
would be difficult to find anywhere lovelier pictures of childhood than
those in which our poet presents the little Bharata, Ayus, Raghu,
Kumara. It is a fact worth noticing that Kalidasa's children are all
boys. Beautiful as his women are, he never does more than glance at a
little girl.

Another pervading note of Kalidasa's writing is his love of external
nature. No doubt it is easier for a Hindu, with his almost instinctive
belief in reincarnation, to feel that all life, from plant to god, is
truly one; yet none, even among the Hindus, has expressed this feeling
with such convincing beauty as has Kalidasa. It is hardly true to say
that he personifies rivers and mountains and trees; to him they have a
conscious individuality as truly and as certainly as animals or men or
gods. Fully to appreciate Kalidasa's poetry one must have spent some
weeks at least among wild mountains and forests untouched by man; there
the conviction grows that trees and flowers are indeed individuals,
fully conscious of a personal life and happy in that life. The return to
urban surroundings makes the vision fade; yet the memory remains, like a
great love or a glimpse of mystic insight, as an intuitive conviction of
a higher truth.

Kalidasa's knowledge of nature is not only sympathetic, it is also
minutely accurate. Not only are the snows and windy music of the
Himalayas, the mighty current of the sacred Ganges, his possession; his
too are smaller streams and trees and every littlest flower. It is
delightful to imagine a meeting between Kalidasa and Darwin. They would
have understood each other perfectly; for in each the same kind of
imagination worked with the same wealth of observed fact.

I have already hinted at the wonderful balance in Kalidasa's character,
by virtue of which he found himself equally at home in a palace and in a
wilderness. I know not with whom to compare him in this; even
Shakespeare, for all his magical insight into natural beauty, is
primarily

<span id="page_xx">p. xx</span>

a poet of the human heart. That can hardly be said of Kalidasa, nor can
it be said that he is primarily a poet of natural beauty. The two
characters unite in him, it might almost be said, chemically. The matter
which I am clumsily endeavouring to make plain is beautifully epitomised
in *The Cloud-Messenger*. The former half is a description of external
nature, yet interwoven with human feeling; the latter half is a picture
of a human heart, yet the picture is framed in natural beauty. So
exquisitely is the thing done that none can say which half is superior.
Of those who read this perfect poem in the original text, some are more
moved by the one, some by the other. Kalidasa understood in the fifth
century what Europe did not learn until the nineteenth, and even now
comprehends only imperfectly: that the world was not made for man, that
man reaches his full stature only as he realises the dignity and worth
of life that is not human.

That Kalidasa seized this truth is a magnificent tribute to his
intellectual power, a quality quite as necessary to great poetry as
perfection of form. Poetical fluency is not rare; intellectual grasp is
not very uncommon: but the combination has not been found perhaps more
than a dozen times since the world began. Because he possessed this
harmonious combination, Kalidasa ranks not with Anacreon and Horace and
Shelley, but with Sophocles, Vergil, Milton.

He would doubtless have been somewhat bewildered by Wordsworth's gospel
of nature. "The world is too much with us," we can fancy him repeating.
"How can the world, the beautiful human world, be too much with us? How
can sympathy with one form of life do other than vivify our sympathy
with other forms of life?"

It remains to say what can be said in a foreign language of Kalidasa's
style. We have seen that he had a formal and systematic education; in
this respect he is rather to be compared with Milton and Tennyson than
with Shakespeare or Burns. He was completely master of his learning. In
an age and a country which reprobated carelessness but were tolerant of
pedantry, he held the scales with a wonderfully even hand, never
heedless and never indulging in the elaborate trifling with Sanskrit
diction which repels the reader from much of Indian literature. It is

<span id="page_xxi">p. xxi</span>

true that some western critics have spoken of his disfiguring conceits
and puerile plays on words. One can only wonder whether these critics
have ever read Elizabethan literature; for Kalidasa's style is far less
obnoxious to such condemnation than Shakespeare's. That he had a rich
and glowing imagination, "excelling in metaphor," as the Hindus
themselves affirm, is indeed true; that he may, both in youth and age,
have written lines which would not have passed his scrutiny in the
vigour of manhood, it is not worth while to deny: yet the total effect
left by his poetry is one of extraordinary sureness and delicacy of
taste. This is scarcely a matter for argument; a reader can do no more
than state his own subjective impression, though he is glad to find that
impression confirmed by the unanimous authority of fifty generations of
Hindus, surely the most competent judges on such a point.

Analysis of Kalidasa's writings might easily be continued, but analysis
can never explain life. The only real criticism is subjective. We know
that Kalidasa is a very great poet, because the world has not been able
to leave him alone.

### KALIDASA

AN ancient heathen poet, loving more  
God's creatures, and His women, and His flowers  
Than we who boast of consecrated powers;  
Still lavishing his unexhausted store

Of love's deep, simple wisdom, healing o’er  
The world's old sorrows, India's griefs and ours;  
That healing love he found in palace towers,  
On mountain, plain, and dark, sea-belted shore,

In songs of holy Raghu's kingly line  
Or sweet Shakuntala in pious grove,  
In hearts that met where starry jasmines twine

Or hearts that from long, lovelorn absence strove  
Together. Still his words of wisdom shine:  
All's well with man, when man and woman love.
