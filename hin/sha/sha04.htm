<p align="center">BENEDICTION UPON THE AUDIENCE</p>  
<p><DIR>EIGHT forms has Shiva, lord of all and king:<br> And these are water, first created thing;<br> And fire, which speeds the sacrifice begun;<br> The priest; and time's dividers, moon and sun;<br> The all-embracing ether, path of sound;<br> The earth, wherein all seeds of life are found;<br> And air, the breath of life: may he draw near,<br> Revealed in these, and bless those gathered here.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>The stage-director</i>. Enough of this! (<i>Turning toward the dressing-room</i>.) Madam, if you are ready, pray come here. (<i>Enter an actress</i>.)</p>  
<p><i>Actress</i>. Here I am, sir. What am I to do?</p>  
<p><i>Director</i>. Our audience is very discriminating, and we are to offer them a new play, called <i>Shakuntala and the ring of recognition</i>, written by the famous Kalidasa. Every member of the cast must be on his mettle.</p>  
<p><i>Actress</i>. Your arrangements are perfect. Nothing will go wrong.</p>  
<p><i>Director</i> (<i>smiling</i>). To tell the truth, madam,</p>  
<p><DIR>Until the wise are satisfied,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot feel that skill is shown;<br> The best-trained mind requires support,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And does not trust itself alone.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Actress</i>. True. What shall we do first?</p>  
<p><i>Director</i>. First, you must sing something to please the ears of the audience.</p>  
<p><i>Actress</i>. What season of the year shall I sing about?</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>Director</i>. Why, sing about the pleasant summer which has just begun. For at this time of year</p>  
<p><DIR>A mid-day plunge will temper heat;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The breeze is rich with forest flowers;<br> To slumber in the shade is sweet;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And charming are the twilight hours.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Actress</i> (<i>sings</i>).</p>  
<p><DIR>The siris-blossoms fair,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With pollen laden,<br> Are plucked to deck her hair<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;By many a maiden,<br> But gently; flowers like these<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Are kissed by eager bees.</DIR></p>  
<p><i>Director</i>. Well done! The whole theatre is captivated by your song, and sits as if painted. What play shall we give them to keep their good-will?</p>  
<p><i>Actress</i>. Why, you just told me we were to give a new play called <i>Shakuntala and the ring</i>.</p>  
<p><i>Director</i>. Thank you for reminding me. For the moment I had quite forgotten.</p>  
<p><DIR>Your charming song had carried me away<br> As the deer enticed the hero of our play.</DIR></p>
