# THE STORY OF SHAKUNTALA

IN the first book of the vast epic poem Mahabharata, Kalidasa found the
story of Shakuntala. The story has a natural place there, for Bharata,
Shakuntala's son, is the eponymous ancestor of the princes who play the
leading part in the epic.

With no little abbreviation of its epic breadth, the story runs as
follows:--

THE EPIC TALE

Once that strong-armed king, with a mighty host of men and chariots,
entered a thick wood. Then when the king had slain thousands of wild
creatures, he entered another wood with his troops and his chariots,
intent on pursuing a deer. And the king beheld a wonderful, beautiful
hermit-age on the bank of the sacred river Malini; on its bank was the
beautiful hermitage of blessed, high-souled Kanva, whither the great
sages resorted. Then the king determined to enter, that he might see the
great sage Kanva, rich in holiness. He laid aside the insignia of
royalty and went on alone, but did not see the austere sage in the
hermitage. Then, when he did not see the sage, and perceived that the
hermitage was deserted, he cried aloud, "Who is here?" until the forest
seemed to shriek. Hearing his cry, a maiden, lovely as Shri, came from
the hermitage, wearing a hermit garb. "Welcome!" she said at once,
greeting him, and smilingly added: "What may be done for you?" Then the
king said to the sweet-voiced maid: "I have come to pay reverence to the
holy sage Kanva. Where has the blessed one gone, sweet girl? Tell me
this, lovely maid."

Shakuntala said: "My blessèd father has gone from the hermitage to
gather fruits. Wait a moment. You shall see him when he returns."

The king did not see the sage, but when the lovely girl of the fair hips
and charming smile spoke to him, he saw that

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

she was radiant in her beauty, yes, in her hard vows and self-restraint
all youth and beauty, and he said to her:

"Who are you? Whose are you, lovely maiden? Why did you come to the
forest? Whence are you, sweet girl, so lovely and so good? Your beauty
stole my heart at the first glance. I wish to know you better. Answer
me, sweet maid."

The maiden laughed when thus questioned by the king in the hermitage,
and the words she spoke were very sweet: "O Dushyanta, I am known as
blessed Kanva's daughter, and he is austere, steadfast, wise, and of a
lofty soul."

Dushyanta said: "But he is chaste, glorious maid, holy, honoured by the
world. Though virtue should swerve from its course, he would not swerve
from the hardness of his vow. How were you born his daughter, for you
are beautiful? I am in great perplexity about this. Pray remove it."

\[Shakuntala here explains how she is the child of a sage and a nymph,
deserted at birth, cared for by birds (*shakuntas*), found and reared by
Kanva, who gave her the name Shakuntala.\]

Dushyanta said: "You are clearly a king's daughter, sweet maiden, as you
say. Become my lovely wife. Tell me, what shall I do for you? Let all my
kingdom be yours to-day. Become my wife, sweet maid."

Shakuntala said: "Promise me truly what I say to you in secret. The son
that is born to me must be your heir. If you promise, Dushyanta, I will
marry you."

"So be it," said the king without thinking, and added: "I will bring you
too to my city, sweet-smiling girl."

So the king took the faultlessly graceful maiden by the hand and dwelt
with her. And when he had bidden her be of good courage, he went forth,
saying again and again: "I will send a complete army for you, and tell
them to bring my sweet-smiling bride to my palace." When he had made
this promise, the king went thoughtfully to find Kanva. "What will he do
when he hears it, this holy, austere man?" he wondered, and still
thinking, he went back to his capital.

Now the moment he was gone, Kanva came to the hermit-age. And Shakuntala
was ashamed and did not come to meet her father. But blessed, austere
Kanva had divine discernment. He discovered her, and seeing the matter

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

with celestial vision, he was pleased and said: "What you have done,
dear, to-day, forgetting me and meeting a man, this does not break the
law. A man who loves may marry secretly the woman who loves him without
a ceremony; and Dushyanta is virtuous and noble, the best of men. Since
you have found a loving husband, Shakuntala, a noble son shall be born
to you, mighty in the world."

Sweet Shakuntala gave birth to a boy of unmeasured prowess. His hands
were marked with the wheel, and he quickly grew to be a glorious boy. As
a six years' child in Kanva's hermitage he rode on the backs of lions,
tigers, and boars near the hermitage, and tamed them, and ran about
playing with them. Then those who lived in Kanva's hermitage gave him a
name. "Let him be called All-tamer," they said: "for he tames
everything."

But when the sage saw the boy and his more than human deeds, he said to
Shakuntala: "It is time for him to be anointed crown prince." When he
saw how strong the boy was, Kanva said to his pupils: "Quickly bring my
Shakuntala and her son from my house to her husband's palace. A long
abiding with their relatives is not proper for married women. It
destroys their reputation, and their character, and their virtue; so
take her without delay." "We will," said all the mighty men, and they
set out with Shakuntala and her son for Gajasahvaya.

When Shakuntala drew near, she was recognised and invited to enter, and
she said to the king: "This is your son, O King. You must anoint him
crown prince, just as you promised before, when we met."

When the king heard her, although he remembered her, he said: "I do not
remember. To whom do you belong, you wicked hermit-woman? I do not
remember a union with you for virtue, love, and wealth. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md) Either go or stay, or do whatever you wish."

When he said this, the sweet hermit-girl half fainted from shame and
grief, and stood stiff as a pillar. Her eyes darkened with passionate
indignation; her lips quivered; she seemed to consume the king as she
gazed at him with sidelong glances. Concealing her feelings and nerved
by anger, she held in check the magic power that her ascetic

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

life had given her. She seemed to meditate a moment, overcome by grief
and anger. She gazed at her husband, then spoke passionately: "O
shameless king, although you know, why do you say, 'I do not know,' like
any other ordinary man?"

Dushyanta said: "I do not know the son born of you, Shakuntala. Women
are liars. Who will believe what you say? Are you not ashamed to say
these incredible things, especially in my presence? You wicked
hermit-woman, go!"

Shakuntala said: "O King, sacred is holy God, and sacred is a holy
promise. Do not break your promise, O King. Let your love be sacred. If
you cling to a lie, and will not believe, alas! I must go away; there is
no union with a man like you. For even without you, Dushyanta, my son
shall rule this foursquare earth adorned with kingly mountains."

When she had said so much to the king, Shakuntala started to go. But a
bodiless voice from heaven said to Dushyanta: "Care for your son,
Dushyanta. Do not despise Shakuntala. You are the boy's father.
Shakuntala tells the truth."

When he heard the utterance of the gods, the king joyfully said to his
chaplain and his ministers: "Hear the words of this heavenly messenger.
If I had received my son simply because of her words, he would be
suspected by the world, he would not be pure."

Then the king received his son gladly and joyfully. He kissed his head
and embraced him lovingly. His wife also Dushyanta honoured, as justice
required. And the king soothed her, and said: "This union which I had
with you was hidden from the world. Therefore I hesitated, O Queen, in
order to save your reputation. And as for the cruel words you said to me
in an excess of passion, these I pardon you, my beautiful, great-eyed
darling, because you love me."

Then King Dushyanta gave the name Bharata to Shakuntala's son, and had
him anointed crown prince.

 

It is plain that this story contains the material for a good play; the
very form of the epic tale is largely dramatic. It is also plain, in a
large way, of what nature are the principal changes which a dramatist
must introduce in the original. For while Shakuntala is charming in the
epic story, the king

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

is decidedly contemptible. Somehow or other, his face must be saved.

To effect this, Kalidasa has changed the old story in three important
respects. In the first place, he introduces the curse of Durvasas,
clouding the king's memory, and saving him from moral responsibility in
his rejection of Shakuntala. That there may be an ultimate recovery of
memory, the curse is so modified as to last only until the king shall
see again the ring which he has given to his bride. To the Hindu, curse
and modification are matters of frequent occurrence; and Kalidasa has so
delicately managed the matter as not to shock even a modern and Western
reader with a feeling of strong improbability. Even to us it seems a
natural part of the divine cloud that envelops the drama, in no way
obscuring human passion, but rather giving to human passion an unwonted
largeness and universality.

In the second place, the poet makes Shakuntala undertake her journey to
the palace before her son is born. Obviously, the king's character is
thus made to appear in a better light, and a greater probability is
given to the whole story.

The third change is a necessary consequence of the first; for without
the curse, there could have been no separation, no ensuing remorse, and
no reunion.

But these changes do not of themselves make a drama out of the epic
tale. Large additions were also necessary, both of scenes and of
characters. We find, indeed, that only acts one and five, with a part of
act seven, rest upon the ancient text, while acts two, three, four, and
six, with most of seven, are a creation of the poet. As might have been
anticipated, the acts of the former group are more dramatic, while those
of the latter contribute more of poetical charm. It is with these that
scissors must be chiefly busy when the play--rather too long for
continuous presentation as it stands--is performed on the stage.

In the epic there are but three characters--Dushyanta, Shakuntala,
Kanva, with the small boy running about in the background. To these
Kalidasa has added from the palace, from the hermitage, and from the
Elysian region which is represented with vague precision in the last
act.

The conventional clown plays a much smaller part in this play than in
the others which Kalidasa wrote. He has also

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

less humour. The real humorous relief is given by the fisher-man and the
three policemen in the opening scene of the sixth act. This, it may be
remarked, is the only scene of rollicking humour in Kalidasa's writing.

The forest scenes are peopled with quiet hermit-folk. Far the most
charming of these are Shakuntala's girl friends. The two are beautifully
differentiated: Anusuya grave, sober; Priyamvada vivacious, saucy; yet
wonderfully united in friendship and in devotion to Shakuntala, whom
they feel to possess a deeper nature than theirs.

Kanva, the hermit-father, hardly required any change from the epic
Kanva. It was a happy thought to place beside him the staid, motherly
Gautami. The small boy in the last act has magically become an
individual in Kalidasa's hands. In this act too are the creatures of a
higher world, their majesty not rendered too precise.

Dushyanta has been saved by the poet from his epic shabbiness; it may be
doubted whether more has been done. There is in him, as in some other
Hindu heroes, a shade too much of the meditative to suit our ideal of
more alert and ready manhood.

But all the other characters sink into insignificance beside the
heroine. Shakuntala dominates the play. She is actually on the stage in
five of the acts, and her spirit pervades the other two, the second and
the sixth. Shakuntala has held captive the heart of India for fifteen
hundred years, and wins the love of increasing thousands in the West;
for so noble a union of sweetness with strength is one of the miracles
of art.

Though lovely women walk the world to-day  
  By tens of thousands, there is none so fair  
In all that exhibition and display  
  With her most perfect beauty to compare--

because it is a most perfect beauty of soul no less than of outward
form. Her character grows under our very eyes. When we first meet her,
she is a simple maiden, knowing no greater sorrow than the death of a
favourite deer; when we bid her farewell, she has passed through happy
love, the mother's joys and pains, most cruel humiliation and suspicion,
and the reunion with her husband, proved at last not to have been
unworthy. And each of these great experiences has

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

been met with a courage and a sweetness to which no words can render
justice.

Kalidasa has added much to the epic tale; yet his use of the original is
remarkably minute. A list of the epic suggestions incorporated in his
play is long. But it is worth making, in order to show how keen is the
eye of genius. Thus the king lays aside the insignia of royalty upon
entering the grove (Act I). Shakuntala appears in hermit garb, a dress
of bark (Act I). The quaint derivation of the heroine's name from
*shakunta*--bird--is used with wonderful skill in a passage (Act VII)
which defies translation, as it involves a play on words. The king's
anxiety to discover whether the maiden's father is of a caste that
permits her to marry him is reproduced (Act I). The marriage without a
ceremony is retained (Act IV), but robbed of all offence. Kanva's
celestial vision, which made it unnecessary for his child to tell him of
her union with the king, is introduced with great delicacy (Act IV). The
curious formation of the boy's hand which indicated imperial birth adds
to the king's suspense (Act VII). The boy's rough play with wild animals
is made convincing (Act VII) and his very nickname All-tamer is
preserved (Act VII). Kanva's worldly wisdom as to husband and wife
dwelling together is reproduced (Act IV). No small part of the
give-and-take between the king and Shakuntala is given (Act V), but with
a new dignity.

Of the construction of the play I speak with diffidence. It seems
admirable to me, the apparently undue length of some scenes hardly
constituting a blemish, as it was probably intended to give the actors
considerable latitude of choice and excision. Several versions of the
text have been preserved; it is from the longer of the two more familiar
ones that the translation in this volume has been made. In the warm
discussion over this matter, certain technical arguments of some weight
have been advanced in favour of this choice; there is also a more
general consideration which seems to me of importance. I find it hard to
believe that any lesser artist could pad such a masterpiece, and pad it
all over, without making the fraud apparent on almost every page. The
briefer version, on the other hand, might easily grow out of the longer,
either as an acting text, or as a school-book.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

We cannot take leave of Shakuntala in any better way than by quoting the
passage <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) in which Levi's imagination
has conjured up "the memorable *première* when Shakuntala saw the light,
in the presence of Vikramaditya and his court."

 

La fête du printemps approche; Ujjayinî, la ville aux riches marchands
et la capitale intellectuelle de l’Inde, glorieuse et prospère sous un
roi victorieux et sage, se prépare à célébrer la solennité avec une
pompe digne de son opulence et de son goût. . . . L’auteur applaudi de
Mâlavikâ . . . le poète dont le souple génie s’accommode sans effort au
ton de l'épopée ou de l'élégie, Kâlidâsa vient d’achever une comédie
héroïque annoncée comme un chef-d’œuvre par la voix de ses amis. . . Le
poète a ses comédiens, qu’il a éprouvés et dressés a sa manière avec
Mâlavikâ. Les comédiens suivront leur poète familier, devenu leur maître
et leur ami. . . . Leur solide instruction, leur goût épuré
reconnaissent les qualités maîtresses de l’œuvre, l’habileté de
l’intrigue, le juste équilibre des sentiments, la fraîcheur de
l’imagination . . .

Vikramâditya entre, suivi des courtisans, et s’asseoit sur son trône;
ses femmes restent à sa gauche; à sa droite les rois vassaux accourus
pour rendre leurs hommages, les princes, les hauts fonctionnaires, les
littérateurs et les savants, groupés autour de Varâha-mihira
l’astrologue et d’Amarasiṃha le lexicographe . . .

Tout à coup, les deux jolies figurantes placées devant le rideau de la
coulisse en écartent les plis, et Duḥṣanta, l’arc et les flèches à la
main, paraît monté sur un char; son cocher tient les rênes; lancés à la
poursuite d’une gazelle imaginaire, ils simulent par leurs gestes la
rapidité de la course; leurs stances pittoresques et descriptives
suggèrent à l’imagination un decor que la peinture serait impuissante à
tracer. Its approchent de l’ermitage; le roi descend à terre, congédie
le cocher, les chevaux et le char, entend les voix des jeunes filles et
se cache. Un mouvement de curiosité

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

agite les spectateurs; fille d’une Apsaras et création de Kâlidâsa,
Çakuntalâ réunit tous les charmes; l’actrice saura-t-elle répondre à
l’attente des connaisseurs et réaliser l’idéal? Elle paraît, vêtue d’une
simple tunique d’écorce qui semble cacher ses formes et par un contraste
habile les embellit encore; la ligne arrondie du visage, les yeux longs,
d’un bleu sombre, langoureux, les seins opulents mal emprisonnés, les
bras délicats laissent à deviner les beautés que le costume ascétique
dérobe. Son attitude, ses gestes ravissent à la fois les regards et les
cœurs; elle pane, et sa voix est un chant. La cour de Vikramâditya
frémit d’une émotion sereine et profonde: un chef-d’oeuvre nouveau vient
d’entrer dans l’immortalité.
