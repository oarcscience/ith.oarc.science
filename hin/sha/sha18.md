# THE SEASONS

*The Seasons* is an unpretentious poem, describing in six short cantos
the six seasons into which the Hindus divide the year. The title is
perhaps a little misleading, as the description is not objective, but
deals with the feelings awakened by each season in a pair of young
lovers. Indeed, the poem might be called a Lover's Calendar. Kalidasa's
authorship has been doubted, without very cogent argument. The question
is not of much interest, as *The Seasons* would neither add greatly to
his reputation nor subtract from it.

The whole poem contains one hundred and forty-four stanzas, or something
less than six hundred lines of verse. There follow a few stanzas
selected from each canto.

### SUMMER

Pitiless heat from heaven pours  
  By day, but nights are cool;  
Continual bathing gently lowers  
  The water in the pool;  
The evening brings a charming peace:  
  For summer-time is here  
When love that never knows surcease,  
  Is less imperious, dear.

Yet love can never fall asleep;  
  For he is waked to-day  
By songs that all their sweetness keep  
  And lutes that softly play,  
By fans with sandal-water wet  
  That bring us drowsy rest,  
By strings of pearls that gently fret  
  Full many a lovely breast.

The sunbeams like the fires are hot  
  That on the altar wake; <span id="page_212">p. 212</span>  
The enmity is quite forgot  
  Of peacock and of snake;  
The peacock spares his ancient foe,  
  For pluck and hunger fail;  
He hides his burning head below  
  The shadow of his tail.

Beneath the garland of the rays  
  That leave no corner cool,  
The water vanishes in haze  
  And leaves a muddy pool;  
The cobra does not hunt for food  
  Nor heed the frog at all  
Who finds beneath the serpent's hood  
  A sheltering parasol.

Dear maiden of the graceful song,  
  To you may summer's power  
Bring moonbeams clear and garlands long  
  And breath of trumpet-flower,  
Bring lakes that countless lilies dot,  
  Refreshing water-sprays,  
Sweet friends at evening, and a spot  
  Cool after burning days.

### THE RAINS

The rain advances like a king  
  In awful majesty;  
Hear, dearest, how his thunders ring  
  Like royal drums, and see  
His lightning-banners wave; a cloud  
  For elephant he rides,  
And finds his welcome from the crowd  
  Of lovers and of brides.

The clouds, a mighty army, march  
  With drumlike thundering  
And stretch upon the rainbow's arch  
  The lightning's flashing string; <span id="page_213">p. 213</span>  
The cruel arrows of the rain  
  Smite them who love, apart  
From whom they love, with stinging pain,  
  And pierce them to the heart.

The forest seems to show its glee  
  In flowering nipa plants;  
In waving twigs of many a tree  
  Wind-swept, it seems to dance;  
Its ketak-blossom's opening sheath  
  Is like a smile put on  
To greet the rain's reviving breath,  
  Now pain and heat are gone.

To you, dear, may the cloudy time  
  Bring all that you desire,  
Bring every pleasure, perfect, prime,  
  To set a bride on fire;  
May rain whereby life wakes and shines  
  Where there is power of life,  
The unchanging friend of clinging vines,  
  Shower blessings on my wife.

### AUTUMN

The autumn comes, a maiden fair  
  In slenderness and grace,  
With nodding rice-stems in her hair  
  And lilies in her face.  
In flowers of grasses she is clad;  
  And as she moves along,  
Birds greet her with their cooing glad  
  Like bracelets' tinkling song.

A diadem adorns the night  
  Of multitudinous stars;  
Her silken robe is white moonlight,  
  Set free from cloudy bars;  
And on her face (the radiant moon)  
  Bewitching smiles are shown: <span id="page_214">p. 214</span>  
She seems a slender maid, who soon  
  Will be a woman grown.

Over the rice-fields, laden plants  
  Are shivering to the breeze;  
While in his brisk caresses dance  
  The blossom-burdened trees;  
He ruffles every lily-pond  
  Where blossoms kiss and part,  
And stirs with lover's fancies fond  
  The young man's eager heart.

### WINTER

The bloom of tenderer flowers is past  
  And lilies droop forlorn,  
For winter-time is come at last,  
  Rich with its ripened corn;  
Yet for the wealth of blossoms lost  
  Some hardier flowers appear  
That bid defiance to the frost  
  Of sterner days, my dear.

The vines, remembering summer, shiver  
  In frosty winds, and gain  
A fuller life from mere endeavour  
  To live through all that pain;  
Yet in the struggle and acquist  
  They turn as pale and wan  
As lonely women who have missed  
  Known love, now lost and gone.

Then may these winter days show forth  
  To you each known delight,  
Bring all that women count as worth  
  Pure happiness and bright;  
While villages, with bustling cry,  
  Bring home the ripened corn,  
And herons wheel through wintry sky,  
  Forget sad thoughts forlorn.

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

### EARLY SPRING

Now, dearest, lend a heedful ear  
  And listen while I sing  
Delights to every maiden dear,  
  The charms of early spring:  
When earth is dotted with the heaps  
  Of corn, when heron-scream  
Is rare but sweet, when passion leaps  
  And paints a livelier dream.

When all must cheerfully applaud  
  A blazing open fire;  
Or if they needs must go abroad,  
  The sun is their desire;  
When everybody hopes to find  
  The frosty chill allayed  
By garments warm, a window-blind  
  Shut, and a sweet young maid.

Then may the days of early spring  
  For you be rich and full  
With love's proud, soft philandering  
  And many a candy-pull,  
With sweetest rice and sugar-cane:  
  And may you float above  
The absent grieving and the pain  
  Of separated love.

### SPRING

A stalwart soldier comes, the spring,  
  Who bears the bow of Love;  
And on that bow, the lustrous string  
  Is made of bees, that move  
With malice as they speed the shaft  
  Of blossoming mango-flower  
At us, dear, who have never laughed  
  At love, nor scorned his power. <span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

Their blossom-burden weights the trees;  
  The winds in fragrance move;  
The lakes are bright with lotuses,  
  The women bright with love;  
The days are soft, the evenings clear  
  And charming; everything  
That moves and lives and blossoms, dear,  
  Is sweeter, in the spring.

The groves are beautifully bright  
  For many and many a mile  
With jasmine-flowers that are as white  
  As loving woman's smile:  
The resolution of a saint  
  Might well be tried by this;  
Far more, young hearts that fancies paint  
  With dreams of loving bliss.
