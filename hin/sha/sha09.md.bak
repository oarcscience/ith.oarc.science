### ACT V

### SHAKUNTALA'S REJECTION

(*Enter a chamberlain*.)

*Chamberlain* (*sighing*). Alas! To what a state am I reduced!

I once assumed the staff of reed  
  For custom's sake alone,  
As officer to guard at need  
  The ladies round the throne.  
But years have passed away and made  
It serve, my tottering steps to aid.

\[paragraph continues\] The king is within. I will tell him of the
urgent business which demands his attention. (*He takes a few steps*.)
But what is the business? (*He recalls it*.) Yes, I remember. Certain
hermits, pupils of Kanva, desire to see his Majesty. Strange, strange!

The mind of age is like a lamp  
  Whose oil is running thin;  
One moment it is shining bright,  
  Then darkness closes in.

\[paragraph continues\] (*He walks and looks about*.) Here is his
Majesty.

He does not seek--until a father's care  
  Is shown his subjects--rest in solitude;  
As a great elephant reeks not of the sun  
  Until his herd is sheltered in the wood.

\[paragraph continues\] In truth, I hesitate to announce the coming of
Kanva's pupils to the king. For he has this moment risen from the throne
of justice. But kings are never weary. For

The sun unyokes his horses never;  
  Blows night and day the breeze;  
Shesha upholds the world forever:  
  And kings are like to these.

(*He walks about. Enter the king, the clown, and retinue according to
rank*.)

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

*King* (*betraying the cares of office*). Every one is happy on
attaining his desire--except a king. His difficulties increase with his
power. Thus:

Security slays nothing but ambition;  
  With great possessions, troubles gather thick;  
Pain grows, not lessens, with a king's position,  
  As when one's hand must hold the sunshade's stick.

*Two court poets behind the scenes*. Victory to your Majesty.

*First poet*.

The world you daily guard and bless,  
Not heeding pain or weariness;  
  Thus is your nature made.  
A tree will brave the noonday, when  
The sun is fierce, that weary men  
  May rest beneath its shade.

*Second poet*.

Vice bows before the royal rod;  
Strife ceases at your kingly nod;  
  You are our strong defender.  
Friends come to all whose wealth is sure,  
But you, alike to rich and poor,  
  Are friend both strong and tender.

*King* (*listening*). Strange! I was wearied by the demands of my
office, but this renews my spirit.

*Clown*. Does a bull forget that he is tired when you call him the
leader of the herd?

*King* (*smiling*). Well, let us sit down. (*They seat themselves, and
the retinue arranges itself. A lute is heard behind the scenes*.)

*Clown* (*listening*). My friend, listen to what is going on in the
music-room. Some one is playing a lute, and keeping good time. I suppose
Lady Hansavati is practising.

*King*. Be quiet. I wish to listen.

*Chamberlain* (*looks at the king*). Ah, the king is occupied. I must
await his leisure. (*He stands aside*.)

*A song behind the scenes*.

You who kissed the mango-flower,  
Honey-loving bee,  
Gave her all your passion's power,  
Ah, so tenderly! <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

How can you be tempted so  
By the lily, pet?  
Fresher honey 's sweet, I know;  
But can you forget?

*King*. What an entrancing song!

*Clown*. But, man, don't you understand what the words mean?

*King* (*smiling*). I was once devoted to Queen Hansavati. And the
rebuke comes from her. Friend Madhavya, tell Queen Hansavati in my name
that the rebuke is a very pretty one.

*Clown*. Yes, sir. (*He rises*.) But, man, you are using another
fellow's fingers to grab a bear's tail-feathers with. I have about as
much chance of salvation as a monk who hasn't forgotten his passions.

*King*. Go. Soothe her like a gentleman.

*Clown*. I suppose I must. (*Exit*.)

*King* (*to himself*). Why am I filled with wistfulness on hearing such
a song? I am not separated from one I love.

And yet

In face of sweet presentment  
  Or harmonies of sound,  
Man e’er forgets contentment,  
  By wistful longings bound.

There must be recollections  
  Of things not seen on earth,  
Deep nature's predilections,  
  Loves earlier than birth.

\[paragraph continues\] (He shows the wistfulness that comes from
unremembered things.)

*Chamberlain* (*approaching*). Victory to your Majesty. Here are hermits
who dwell in the forest at the foot of the Himalayas. They bring women
with them, and they carry a message from Kanva. What is your pleasure
with regard to them?

*King* (*astonished*). Hermits? Accompanied by women? From Kanva?

*Chamberlain*. Yes.

*King*. Request my chaplain Somarata in my name to

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

receive these hermits in the manner prescribed by Scripture, and to
conduct them himself before me. I will await them in a place fit for
their reception.

*Chamberlain*. Yes, your Majesty. (*Exit*.)

*King* (*rising*). Vetravati, conduct me to the fire-sanctuary.

*Portress*. Follow me, your Majesty. (*She walks about*.) Your Majesty,
here is the terrace of the fire-sanctuary. It is beautiful, for it has
just been swept, and near at hand is the cow that yields the milk of
sacrifice. Pray ascend it.

*King* (*ascends and stands leaning on the shoulder of an attendant*.)
Vetravati, with what purpose does Father Kanva send these hermits to me?

Do leaguèd powers of sin conspire  
To balk religion's pure desire?  
Has wrong been done to beasts that roam  
Contented round the hermits' home?  
Do plants no longer bud and flower,  
To warn me of abuse of power?  
These doubts and more assail my mind,  
But leave me puzzled, lost, and blind.

*Portress*. How could these things be in a hermitage that rests in the
fame of the king's arm? No, I imagine they have come to pay homage to
their king, and to congratulate him on his pious rule.

(*Enter the chaplain and the chamberlain, conducting the two pupils of*
KANVA, *With* GAUTAMI *and* SHAKUNTALA.)

*Chamberlain*. Follow me, if you please.

*Sharngarava*. Friend Sharadvata,

The king is noble and to virtue true;  
  None dwelling here commit the deed of shame;  
Yet we ascetics view the worldly crew  
  As in a house all lapped about with flame.

*Sharadvata*. Sharngarava, your emotion on entering the city is quite
just. As for me,

Free from the world and all its ways,  
I see them spending worldly days  
As clean men view men smeared with oil,  
As pure men, those whom passions soil,  
As waking men view men asleep,  
As free men, those in bondage deep.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

*Chaplain*. That is why men like you are great.

*Shakuntala* (*observing an evil omen*). Oh, why does my right eye
throb?

*Gautami*. Heaven avert the omen, my child. May happiness wait upon you.
(*They walk about*.)

*Chaplain* (*indicating the king*). O hermits, here is he who protects
those of every station and of every age. He has already risen, and
awaits you. Behold him.

*Sharngarava*. Yes, it is admirable, but not surprising. For

Fruit-laden trees bend down to earth;  
  The water-pregnant clouds hang low;  
Good men are not puffed up by power  
  The unselfish are by nature so.

*Portress*. Your Majesty, the hermits seem to be happy. They give you
gracious looks.

*King* (*observing* SHAKUNTALA). Ah!

Who is she, shrouded in the veil  
  That dims her beauty's lustre,  
Among the hermits like a flower  
  Round which the dead leaves cluster?

*Portress*. Your Majesty, she is well worth looking at.

*King*. Enough! I must not gaze upon another's wife.

*Shakuntala* (*laying her hand on her breast. Aside*). Oh, my heart, why
tremble so? Remember his constant love and be brave.

*Chaplain* (*advancing*). Hail, your Majesty. The hermits have been
received as Scripture enjoins. They have a message from their teacher.
May you be pleased to hear it.

*King* (*respectfully*). I am all attention.

*The two pupils* (*raising their right hands*). Victory, O King.

*King* (*bowing low*). I salute you all.

*The two pupils*. All hail.

*King*. Does your pious life proceed without disturbance?

*The two pupils*.

How could the pious duties fail  
  While you defend the right?  
Or how could darkness' power prevail  
  O’er sunbeams shining bright?

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

*King* (*to himself*). Indeed, my royal title is no empty one.
(*Aloud*.) Is holy Kanva in health?

*Sharngarava*. O King, those who have religious power can command
health. He asks after your welfare and sends this message.

*King*. What are his commands?

*Sharngarava*. He says: "Since you have met this my daughter and have
married her, I give you my glad consent. For

You are the best of worthy men, they say;  
  And she, I know, Good Works personified;  
The Creator wrought for ever and a day,  
  In wedding such a virtuous groom and bride.

\[paragraph continues\] She is with child. Take her and live with her in
virtue."

*Gautami*. Bless you, sir. I should like to say that no one invites me
to speak.

*King*. Speak, mother.

*Gautami*.

Did she with father speak or mother?  
  Did you engage her friends in speech?  
Your faith was plighted each to other;  
  Let each be faithful now to each.

*Shakuntala*. What will my husband say?

*King* (*listening with anxious suspicion*). What is this insinuation?

*Shakuntala* (*to herself*). Oh, oh! So haughty and so slanderous!

*Sharngarava*. "What is this insinuation?" What is your question? Surely
you know the world's ways well enough.

Because the world suspects a wife  
  Who does not share her husband's lot,  
Her kinsmen wish her to abide  
  With him, although he love her not.

*King*. You cannot mean that this young woman is my wife.

*Shakuntala* (*sadly to herself*). Oh, my heart, you feared it, and now
it has come.

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

*Sharngarava*. O King,

A king, and shrink when love is done,  
  Turn coward's back on truth, and flee!

*King*. What means this dreadful accusation?

*Sharngarava* (*furiously*).

O drunk with power! We might have known  
  That you were steeped in treachery.

*King*. A stinging rebuke!

*Gautami* (*to* SHAKUNTALA). Forget your shame, my child. I will remove
your veil. Then your husband will recognise you. (*She does so*.)

*King* (*observing* SHAKUNTALA. *To himself*).

As my heart ponders whether I could ever  
Have wed this woman that has come to me  
In tortured loveliness, as I endeavour  
To bring it back to mind, then like a bee

That hovers round a jasmine flower at dawn,  
While frosty dews of morning still o’erweave it,  
And hesitates to sip ere they be gone,  
I cannot taste the sweet, and cannot leave it.

*Portress* (*to herself*). What a virtuous king he is! Would any other
man hesitate when he saw such a pearl of a woman coming of her own
accord?

*Sharngarava*. Have you nothing to say, O King?

*King*. Hermit, I have taken thought. I cannot believe that this woman
is my wife. She is plainly with child. How can I take her, confessing
myself an adulterer?

*Shakuntala* (*to herself*). Oh, oh, oh! He even casts doubt on our
marriage. The vine of my hope climbed high, but it is broken now.

*Sharngarava*. Not so.

You scorn the sage who rendered whole  
  His child befouled, and choked his grief,  
Who freely gave you what you stole  
  And added honour to a thief!

*Sharadvata*. Enough, Sharngarava. Shakuntala, we have

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

said what we were sent to say. You hear his words. Answer him.

*Shakuntala* (*to herself*). He loved me so. He is so changed. Why
remind him? Ah, but I must clear my own character. Well, I will try.
(*Aloud*.) My dear husband--(*She stops*.) No, he doubts my right to
call him that. Your Majesty, it was pure love that opened my poor heart
to you in the hermitage. Then you were kind to me and gave me your
promise. Is it right for you to speak so now, and to reject me?

*King* (*stopping his ears*). Peace, peace!

A stream that eats away the bank,  
  Grows foul, and undermines the tree.  
So you would stain your honour, while  
  You plunge me into misery.

*Shakuntala*. Very well. If you have acted so because you really fear to
touch another man's wife, I will remove your doubts with a token you
gave me.

*King*. An excellent idea!

*Shakuntala* (*touching her finger*). Oh, oh! The ring is lost. (*She
looks sadly at* GAUTAMI.)

*Gautami*. My child, you worshipped the holy Ganges at the spot where
Indra descended. The ring must have fallen there.

*King*. Ready wit, ready wit!

*Shakuntala*. Fate is too strong for me there. I will tell you something
else.

*King*. Let me hear what you have to say.

*Shakuntala*. One day, in the bower of reeds, you were holding a
lotus-leaf cup full of water.

*King*. I hear you.

*Shakuntala*. At that moment the fawn came up, my adopted son. Then you
took pity on him and coaxed him. "Let him drink first," you said. But he
did not know you, and he would not come to drink water from your hand.
But he liked it afterwards, when I held the very same water. Then you
smiled and said: "It is true. Every one trusts his own sort. You both
belong to the forest."

*King*. It is just such women, selfish, sweet, false, that entice fools.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

*Gautami*. You have no right to say that. She grew up in the pious
grove. She does not know how to deceive.

*King*. Old hermit woman,

The female's untaught cunning may be seen  
  In beasts, far more in women selfish-wise;  
The cuckoo's eggs are left to hatch and rear  
  By foster-parents, and away she flies.

*Shakuntala* (*angrily*). Wretch! You judge all this by your own false
heart. Would any other man do what you have done? To hide behind virtue,
like a yawning well covered over with grass!

*King* (*to himself*). But her anger is free from coquetry, because she
has lived in the forest. See!

Her glance is straight; her eyes are flashing red;  
Her speech is harsh, not drawlingly well-bred;  
Her whole lip quivers, seems to shake with cold;  
Her frown has straightened eyebrows arching bold.

\[paragraph continues\] No, she saw that I was doubtful, and her anger
was feigned. Thus

When I refused but now  
  Hard-heartedly, to know  
Of love or secret vow,  
  Her eyes grew red; and so,  
Bending her arching brow,  
  She fiercely snapped Love's bow.

\[paragraph continues\] (*Aloud*.) My good girl, Dushyanta's conduct is
known to the whole kingdom, but not this action.

*Shakuntala*. Well, well. I had my way. I trusted a king, and put myself
in his hands. He had a honey face and a heart of stone. (She covers her
face with her dress and weeps.)

*Sharngarava*. Thus does unbridled levity burn.

Be slow to love, but yet more slow  
     With secret mate;  
With those whose hearts we do not know,  
     Love turns to hate.

*King*. Why do you trust this girl, and accuse me of an imaginary crime?

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

*Sharngarava* (*disdainfully*). You have learned your wisdom upside
down.

It would be monstrous to believe  
  A girl who never lies;  
Trust those who study to deceive  
  And think it very wise.

*King*. Aha, my candid friend! Suppose I were to admit that I am such a
man. What would happen if I deceived the girl?

*Sharngarava*. Ruin.

*King*. It is unthinkable that ruin should fall on Puru's line.

*Sharngarava*. Why bandy words? We have fulfilled our Father's bidding.
We are ready to return.

Leave her or take her, as you will;  
     She is your wife;  
Husbands have power for good or ill  
     O’er woman's life.

\[paragraph continues\] Gautami, lead the way. (*They start to go*.)

*Shakuntala*. He has deceived me shamelessly. And will you leave me too?
(*She starts to follow*.)

*Gautami* (*turns around and sees her*). Sharngarava, my son, Shakuntala
is following us, lamenting piteously. What can the poor child do with a
husband base enough to reject her?

*Sharngarava* (*turns angrily*). You self-willed girl! Do you dare show
independence? (SHAKUNTALA *shrinks in fear*.) Listen.

If you deserve such scorn and blame,  
What will your father with your shame?  
But if you know your vows are pure,  
Obey your husband and endure.

\[paragraph continues\] Remain. We must go.

*King*. Hermit, why deceive this woman? Remember:

Night-blossoms open to the moon,  
  Day-blossoms to the sun;  
A man of honour ever strives  
  Another's wife to shun.

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

*Sharngarava*. O King, suppose you had forgotten your former actions in
the midst of distractions. Should you now desert your wife--you who fear
to fail in virtue?

*King*. I ask *you* which is the heavier sin:

Not knowing whether I be mad  
  Or falsehood be in her,  
Shall I desert a faithful wife  
  Or turn adulterer?

*Chaplain* (*considering*). Now if this were done------

*King*. Instruct me, my teacher.

*Chaplain*. Let the woman remain in my house until her child is born.

*King*. Why this?

*Chaplain*. The chief astrologers have told you that your first child
was destined to be an emperor. If the son of the hermit's daughter is
born with the imperial birthmarks, then welcome her and introduce her
into the palace. Other- wise, she must return to her father.

*King*. It is good advice, my teacher.

*Chaplain* (*rising*). Follow me, my daughter.

*Shakuntala*. O mother earth, give me a grave! (*Exit weeping, with the
chaplain, the hermits, and* GAUTAMI. *The king, his memory clouded by
the curse, ponders on* SHAKUNTALA.)

*Voices behind the scenes*. A miracle! A miracle!

*King* (*listening*). What does this mean? (*Enter the chaplain*.)

*Chaplain* (*in amazement*). Your Majesty, a wonderful thing has
happened.

*King*. What?

*Chaplain*. When Kanva's pupils had departed,

She tossed her arms, bemoaned her plight,  
Accused her crushing fate------

*King*. What then?

*Chaplain*.

Before our eyes a heavenly light  
In woman's form, but shining bright,  
  Seized her and vanished straight.

(*All betray astonishment*.)

*King*. My teacher, we have already settled the matter. Why speculate in
vain? Let us seek repose.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

*Chaplain*. Victory to your Majesty. (*Exit*.)

*King*. Vetravati, I am bewildered. Conduct me to my apartment.

*Portress*. Follow me, your Majesty.

*King* (*walks about. To himself*).

With a hermit-wife I had no part,  
  All memories evade me;  
And yet my sad and stricken heart  
  Would more than half persuade me.

(*Exeunt omnes*.)
