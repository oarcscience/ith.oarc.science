### ACT VII

(*Enter, in a chariot that flies through the air, the king and* MATALI.)

*King*. Matali, though I have done what Indra commanded, I think myself
an unprofitable servant, when I remember his most gracious welcome.

*Matali*. O King, know that each considers himself the other's debtor.
For

You count the service given  
  Small by the welcome paid,  
Which to the king of heaven  
  Seems mean for such brave aid.

*King*. Ah, no! For the honour given me at parting went far beyond
imagination. Before the gods, he seated me beside him on his throne. And
then

He smiled, because his son Jayanta's heart  
  Beat quicker, by the self-same wish oppressed,  
And placed about my neck the heavenly wreath  
  Still fragrant from the sandal on his breast.

*Matali*. But what do you not deserve from heaven's king? Remember:

Twice, from peace-loving Indra's sway  
The demon-thorn was plucked away:  
  First, by Man-lion's crooked claws;  
Again, by your smooth shafts to-day.

*King*. This merely proves Indra's majesty. Remember:

All servants owe success in enterprise  
  To honour paid before the great deed's done;  
Could dawn defeat the darkness otherwise  
  Than resting on the chariot of the sun?

*Matali*. The feeling becomes you. (*After a little*.) See, O King! Your
glory has the happiness of being published abroad in heaven.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

With colours used by nymphs of heaven  
  To make their beauty shine,  
Gods write upon the surface given  
  Of many a magic vine,  
As worth their song, the simple story  
Of those brave deeds that made your glory.

*King*. Matali, when I passed before, I was intent on fighting the
demons, and did not observe this region. Tell me. In which path of the
winds are we?

*Matali*.

It is the windpath sanctified  
By holy Vishnu's second stride;  
Which, freed from dust of passion, ever  
Upholds the threefold heavenly river;  
And, driving them with reins of light,  
Guides the stars in wheeling flight.

*King*. That is why serenity pervades me, body and soul. (*He observes
the path taken by the chariot*.) It seems that we have descended into
the region of the clouds.

*Matali*. How do you perceive it?

*King*.

Plovers that fly from mountain-caves,  
Steeds that quick-flashing lightning laves,  
And chariot-wheels that drip with spray--  
A path o’er pregnant clouds betray.

*Matali*. You are right. And in a moment you will be in the world over
which you bear rule.

*King* (*looking down*). Matali, our quick descent gives the world of
men a mysterious look. For

The plains appear to melt and fall  
From mountain peaks that grow more tall;  
The trunks of trees no longer hide  
Nor in their leafy nests abide;  
The river network now is clear,  
For smaller streams at last appear:  
It seems as if some being threw  
The world to me, for clearer view.

*Matali*. You are a good observer, O King. (*He looks down,
awe-struck*.) There is a noble loveliness in the earth.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

*King*. Matali, what mountain is this, its flanks sinking into the
eastern and into the western sea? It drips liquid gold like a cloud at
sunset.

*Matali*. O King, this is Gold Peak, the mountain of the fairy centaurs.
Here it is that ascetics most fully attain to magic powers. See!

The ancient sage, Marichi's son,  
Child of the Uncreated One,  
Father of superhuman life,  
Dwells here austerely with his wife.

*King* (*reverently*). I must not neglect the happy chance. I cannot go
farther until I have walked humbly about the holy one.

*Matali*. It is a worthy thought, O King. (*The chariot descends*.) We
have come down to earth.

*King* (*astonished*). Matali,

The wheels are mute on whirling rim;  
  Unstirred, the dust is lying there;  
We do not bump the earth, but skim:  
  Still, still we seem to fly through air.

*Matali*. Such is the glory of the chariot which obeys you and Indra.

*King*. In which direction lies the hermitage of Marichi's son?

*Matali* (*pointing*). See!

Where stands the hermit, horridly austere,  
Whom clinging vines are choking, tough and sere;  
Half-buried in an ant-hill that has grown  
About him, standing post-like and alone;  
Sun-staring with dim eyes that know no rest,  
The dead skin of a serpent on his breast:  
So long he stood unmoved, insensate there  
That birds build nests within his mat of hair.

*King* (*gazing*). All honour to one who mortifies the flesh so
terribly.

*Matali* (*checking the chariot*). We have entered the hermitage of the
ancient sage, whose wife Aditi tends the coral-trees.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

*King*. Here is deeper contentment than in heaven. I seem plunged in a
pool of nectar.

*Matali* (*stopping the chariot*). Descend, O King.

*King* (*descending*). But how will you fare?

*Matali*. The chariot obeys the word of command. I too will descend. (He
does so.) Before you, O King, are the groves where the holiest hermits
lead their self-denying life.

*King*. I look with amazement both at their simplicity and at what they
might enjoy.

Their appetites are fed with air  
Where grows whatever is most fair;  
They bathe religiously in pools  
Which golden lily-pollen cools;  
They pray within a jewelled home,  
Are chaste where nymphs of heaven roam:  
They mortify desire and sin  
With things that others fast to win.

*Matali*. The desires of the great aspire high. (*He walks about and
speaks to some one not visible*.) Ancient Shakalya, how is Marichi's
holy son occupied? (*He listens*.) What do you say? That he is
explaining to Aditi, in answer to her question, the duties of a faithful
wife? My matter must await a fitter time. (*He turns to the king*.) Wait
here, O King, in the shade of the ashoka tree, till I have announced
your coming to the sire of Indra.

*King*. Very well. (Exit MATALI. *The king's arm throbs, a happy omen*.)

I dare not hope for what I pray;  
  Why thrill--in vain?  
For heavenly bliss once thrown away  
  Turns into pain.

*A voice behind the scenes*. Don't! You mustn't be so foolhardy. Oh, you
are always the same.

*King* (*listening*). No naughtiness could feel at home in this spot.
Who draws such a rebuke upon himself? (*He looks towards the sound. In
surprise*.) It is a child, but no child in strength. And two
hermit-women are trying to control him.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

He drags a struggling lion cub,  
  The lioness' milk half-sucked, half-missed,  
Towzles his mane, and tries to drub  
  Him tame with small, imperious fist.

(*Enter a small boy, as described, and two hermit-women*.)

*Boy*. Open your mouth, cub. I want to count your teeth.

*First woman*. Naughty boy, why do you torment our pets? They are like
children to us. Your energy seems to take the form of striking
something. No wonder the hermits call you All-tamer.

*King*. Why should my heart go out to this boy as if he were my own son?
(*He reflects*.) No doubt my childless state makes me sentimental.

*Second woman*. The lioness will spring at you if you don't let her baby
go.

*Boy* (*smiling*). Oh, I'm dreadfully scared. (*He bites his lip*.)

*King* (*in surprise*).

The boy is seed of fire  
  Which, when it grows, will burn;  
A tiny spark that soon  
  To awful flame may turn.

*First woman*. Let the little lion go, dear. I will give you another
plaything.

*Boy*. Where is it? Give it to me. (*He stretches out his hand*.)

*King* (*looking at the hand*.) He has one of the imperial birthmarks!
For

Between the eager fingers grow  
  The close-knit webs together drawn,  
Like some lone lily opening slow  
  To meet the kindling blush of dawn.

*Second woman*. Suvrata, we can't make him stop by talking. Go. In my
cottage you will find a painted clay peacock that belongs to the
hermit-boy Mankanaka. Bring him that.

*First woman*. I will. (*Exit*.)

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

*Boy*. Meanwhile I'll play with this one.

*Hermit-woman* (*looks and laughs*). Let him go.

*King*. My heart goes out to this wilful child. (*Sighing*.)

They show their little buds of teeth  
  In peals of causeless laughter;  
They hide their trustful heads beneath  
  Your heart. And stumbling after  
Come sweet, unmeaning sounds that sing  
  To you. The father warms  
And loves the very dirt they bring  
  Upon their little forms.

*Hermit-woman* (*shaking her finger*). Won't you mind me?

(*She looks about*.) Which one of the hermit-boys is here?

(*She sees the king*.) Oh, sir, please come here and free this lion cub.
The little rascal is tormenting him, and I can't make him let go.

*King*. Very well. (*He approaches, smiling*.) O little son of a great
sage!

Your conduct in this place apart,  
Is most unfit;  
’Twould grieve your father's pious heart  
And trouble it.

To animals he is as good  
As good can be;  
You spoil it, like a black snake's brood  
In sandal tree.

*Hermit-woman*. But, sir, he is not the son of a hermit.

*King*. So it would seem, both from his looks and his actions. But in
this spot, I had no suspicion of anything else. (*He loosens the boy's
hold on the cub, and touching him, says to himself*.)

It makes me thrill to touch the boy,  
  The stranger's son, to me unknown;  
What measureless content must fill  
  The man who calls the child his own!

*Hermit-woman* (*looking at the two*). Wonderful! wonderful!

*King*. Why do you say that, mother?

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

*Hermit-woman*. I am astonished to see how much the boy looks like you,
sir. You are not related. Besides, he is a perverse little creature and
he does not know you. Yet he takes no dislike to you.

*King* (*caressing the boy*). Mother, if he is not the son of a hermit,
what is his family?

*Hermit-woman*. The family of Puru.

*King* (*to himself*). He is of one family with me! Then could my
thought be true? (*Aloud*.) But this is the custom of Puru's line:

In glittering palaces they dwell  
While men, and rule the country well;  
Then make the grove their home in age,  
And die in austere hermitage.

\[paragraph continues\] But how could human beings, of their own mere
motion, attain this spot?

*Hermit-woman*. You are quite right, sir. But the boy's mother was
related to a nymph, and she bore her son in the pious grove of the
father of the gods.

*King* (*to himself*). Ah, a second ground for hope. (*Aloud*.) What was
the name of the good king whose wife she was?

*Hermit-woman*. Who would speak his name? He rejected his true wife.

*King* (*to himself*). This story points at me. Suppose I ask the boy
for his mother's name. (*He reflects*.) No, it is wrong to concern
myself with one who may be another's wife. (*Enter the first woman, with
the clay peacock*.)

*First woman*. Look, All-tamer. Here is the bird, the shakunta. Isn't
the shakunta lovely?

*Boy* (*looks about*). Where is my mamma? (*The two women burst out
laughing*.)

*First woman*. It sounded like her name, and deceived him. He loves his
mother.

*Second woman*. She said: "See how pretty the peacock is." That is all.

*King* (*to himself*). His mother's name is Shakuntala! But names are
alike. I trust this hope may not prove a disappointment in the end, like
a mirage.

*Boy*. I like this little peacock, sister. Can it fly? (*He seizes the
toy*.)

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

*First woman* (*looks at the boy. Anxiously*). Oh, the amulet is not on
his wrist.

*King*. Do not be anxious, mother. It fell while he was struggling with
the lion cub. (*He starts to pick it up*.)

*The two women*. Oh, don't, don't! (*They look at him*.) He has touched
it! (*Astonished, they lay their hands on their bosoms, and look at each
other*.)

*King*. Why did you try to prevent me?

*First woman*. Listen, your Majesty. This is a divine and most potent
charm, called the Invincible. Marichi's holy son gave it to the baby
when the birth-ceremony was performed. If it falls on the ground, no one
may touch it except the boy's parents or the boy himself.

*King*. And if another touch it?

*First woman*. It becomes a serpent and stings him.

*King*. Did you ever see this happen to any one else?

*Both women*. More than once.

*King* (*joyfully*). Then why may I not welcome my hopes fulfilled at
last? (*He embraces the boy*.)

*Second woman*. Come, Suvrata. Shakuntala is busy with her religious
duties. We must go and tell her what has happened. (*Exeunt ambo*.)

*Boy*. Let me go. I want to see my mother.

*King*. My son, you shall go with me to greet your mother.

*Boy*. Dushyanta is my father, not you.

*King* (*smiling*). You show I am right by contradicting me. (*Enter*
SHAKUNTALA, *wearing her hair in a single braid*.)

*Shakuntala* (*doubtfully*). I have heard that All-tamer's amulet did
not change when it should have done so. But I do not trust my own
happiness. Yet perhaps it is as Mishrakeshi told me. (*She walks
about*.)

King (*looking at* SHAKUNTALA. *With plaintive joy*). It is she. It is
Shakuntala.

The pale, worn face, the careless dress,  
  The single braid,  
Show her still true, me pitiless,  
  The long vow paid.

*Shakuntala* (*seeing the king pale with remorse. Doubtfully*). It is
not my husband. Who is the man that soils my boy with his caresses? The
amulet should protect him.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

*Boy* (*running to his mother*). Mother, he is a man that belongs to
other people. And he calls me his son.

*King*. My darling, the cruelty I showed you has turned to happiness.
Will you not recognise me?

*Shakuntala* (*to herself*). Oh, my heart, believe it. Fate struck hard,
but its envy is gone and pity takes its place. It is my husband.

*King*.

Black madness flies;  
  Comes memory;  
Before my eyes  
  My love I see.

Eclipse flees far;  
  Light follows soon;  
The loving star  
  Draws to the moon.

*Shakuntala*. Victory, victo----- (*Tears choke her utterance*.)

*King*.

The tears would choke you, sweet, in vain;  
  My soul with victory is fed,  
Because I see your face again--  
  No jewels, but the lips are red.

*Boy*. Who is he, mother?

*Shakuntala*. Ask fate, my child. (*She weeps*.)

*King*.

Dear, graceful wife, forget;  
  Let the sin vanish;  
Strangely did madness strive  
  Reason to banish.

Thus blindness works in men,  
  Love's joy to shake;  
Spurning a garland, lest  
  It prove a snake. (*He falls at her feet*.)

*Shakuntala*. Rise, my dear husband. Surely, it was some old sin of mine
that broke my happiness--though it has turned again to happiness.
Otherwise, how could you, dear, have acted so? You are so kind. (*The
king rises*.) But what brought back the memory of your suffering wife?

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

*King*. I will tell you when I have plucked out the dart of sorrow.

’Twas madness, sweet, that could let slip  
A tear to burden your dear lip;  
On graceful lashes seen to-day,  
I wipe it, and our grief, away.

(*He does so*.)

*Shakuntala* (*sees more clearly and discovers the ring*). My husband,
it is the ring!

*King*. Yes. And when a miracle recovered it, my memory returned.

*Shakuntala*. That was why it was so impossible for me to win your
confidence.

*King*. Then let the vine receive her flower, as earnest of her union
with spring.

*Shakuntala*. I do not trust it. I would rather you wore it. (*Enter*
MATALI.)

*Matali*. I congratulate you, O King, on reunion with your wife and on
seeing the face of your son.

*King*. My desires bear sweeter fruit because fulfilled through a
friend. Matali, was not this matter known to Indra?

*Matali* (*smiling*). What is hidden from the gods? Come. Marichi's holy
son, Kashyapa, wishes to see you.

*King*. My dear wife, bring our son. I could not appear without you
before the holy one.

*Shakuntala*. I am ashamed to go before such parents with my husband.

*King*. It is the custom in times of festival. Come. (*They walk about*.
KASHYAPA *appears seated, with* ADITI.)

*Kashyapa* (*looking at the king*). Aditi,

’Tis King Dushyanta, he who goes before  
  Your son in battle, and who rules the earth,  
Whose bow makes Indra's weapon seem no more  
  Than a fine plaything, lacking sterner worth.

*Aditi*. His valour might be inferred from his appearance.

*Matali*. O King, the parents of the gods look upon you with a glance
that betrays parental fondness. Approach them.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

*King*. Matali,

Sprung from the Creator's children, do I see  
Great Kashyapa and Mother Aditi?  
The pair that did produce the sun in heaven,  
To which each year twelve changing forms are given;  
That brought the king of all the gods to birth,  
Who rules in heaven, in hell, and on the earth;  
That Vishnu, than the Uncreated higher,  
Chose as his parents with a fond desire.

*Matali*. It is indeed they.

*King* (*falling before them*). Dushyanta, servant of Indra, does
reverence to you both.

*Kashyapa*. My son, rule the earth long.

*Aditi*. And be invincible. (SHAKUNTALA *and her son fall at their
feet*.)

*Kashyapa*. My daughter,

Your husband equals Indra, king  
  Of gods; your son is like his son;  
No further blessing need I bring:  
  Win bliss such as his wife has won.

*Aditi*. My child, keep the favour of your husband. And may this fine
boy be an honour to the families of both parents. Come, let us be
seated. (*All seat themselves*.)

*Kashyapa* (*indicating one after the other*).

Faithful Shakuntala, the boy,  
  And you, O King, I see  
A trinity to bless the world--  
  Faith, Treasure, Piety.

*King*. Holy one, your favour shown to us is without parallel. You
granted the fulfilment of our wishes before you called us to your
presence. For, holy one,

The flower comes first, and then the fruit;  
  The clouds appear before the rain;  
Effect comes after cause; but you  
  First helped, then made your favour plain.

*Matali*. O King, such is the favour shown by the parents of the world.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

*King*. Holy one, I married this your maid-servant by the voluntary
ceremony. When after a time her relatives brought her to me, my memory
failed and I rejected her. In so doing, I sinned against Kanva, who is
kin to you. But afterwards, when I saw the ring, I perceived that I had
married her. And this seems very wonderful to me.

Like one who doubts an elephant,  
  Though seeing him stride by,  
And vet believes when he has seen  
  The footprints left; so I.

*Kashyapa*. My son, do not accuse yourself of sin. Your infatuation was
inevitable. Listen.

*King*. I am all attention.

*Kashyapa*. When the nymph Menaka descended to earth and received
Shakuntala, afflicted at her rejection, she came to Aditi. Then I
perceived the matter by my divine insight. I saw that the unfortunate
girl had been rejected by her rightful husband because of Durvasas'
curse. And that the curse would end when the ring came to light.

*King* (*with a sigh of relief. To himself*). Then I am free from blame.

*Shakuntala* (*to herself*). Thank heaven! My husband did not reject me
of his own accord. He really did not remember me. I suppose I did not
hear the curse in my absent-minded state, for my friends warned me most
earnestly to show my husband the ring.

*Kashyapa*. My daughter, you know the truth. Do not now give way to
anger against your rightful husband.

Remember:

The curse it was that brought defeat and pain;  
The darkness flies; you are his queen again.  
Reflections are not seen in dusty glass,  
Which, cleaned, will mirror all the things that pass.

*King*. It is most true, holy one.

*Kashyapa*. My son, I hope you have greeted as he deserves the son whom
Shakuntala has borne you, for whom I myself have performed the
birth-rite and the other ceremonies.

*King*. Holy one, the hope of my race centres in him.

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

*Kashyapa*. Know then that his courage will make him emperor.

Journeying over every sea,  
His car will travel easily;  
The seven islands of the earth  
Will bow before his matchless worth;  
Because wild beasts to him were tame,  
All-tamer was his common name;  
As Bharata he shall be known,  
For he will bear the world alone.

*King*. I anticipate everything from him, since you have performed the
rites for him.

*Aditi*. Kanva also should be informed that his daughter's wishes are
fulfilled. But Menaka is waiting upon me here and cannot be spared.

*Shakuntala* (*to herself*). The holy one has expressed my own desire.
Kashyapa. Kanva knows the whole matter through his divine insight. (*He
reflects*.) Yet he should hear from us the pleasant tidings, how his
daughter and her son have been received by her husband. Who waits
without? (*Enter a pupil*.)

*Pupil*. I am here, holy one.

*Kashyapa*. Galava, fly through the air at once, carrying pleasant
tidings from me to holy Kanva. Tell him how Durvasas' curse has come to
an end, how Dushyanta recovered his memory, and has taken Shakuntala
with her child to himself.

*Pupil*. Yes, holy one. (*Exit*.)

*Kashyapa* (*to the king*). My son, enter with child and wife the
chariot of your friend Indra, and set out for your capital.

*King*. Yes, holy one.

*Kashyapa*. For now

May Indra send abundant rain,  
Repaid by sacrificial gain;  
With aid long mutually given,  
Rule you on earth, and he in heaven.

*King*. Holy one, I will do my best.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

*Kashyapa*. What more, my son, shall I do for you?

*King*. Can there be more than this? Yet may this prayer be fulfilled.

May kingship benefit the land,  
And wisdom grow in scholars' band;  
May Shiva see my faith on earth  
And make me free of all rebirth.

(*Exeunt omnes*.)
