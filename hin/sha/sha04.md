# SHAKUNTALA

### PROLOGUE

BENEDICTION UPON THE AUDIENCE

EIGHT forms has Shiva, lord of all and king:  
And these are water, first created thing;  
And fire, which speeds the sacrifice begun;  
The priest; and time's dividers, moon and sun;  
The all-embracing ether, path of sound;  
The earth, wherein all seeds of life are found;  
And air, the breath of life: may he draw near,  
Revealed in these, and bless those gathered here.

*The stage-director*. Enough of this! (*Turning toward the
dressing-room*.) Madam, if you are ready, pray come here. (*Enter an
actress*.)

*Actress*. Here I am, sir. What am I to do?

*Director*. Our audience is very discriminating, and we are to offer
them a new play, called *Shakuntala and the ring of recognition*,
written by the famous Kalidasa. Every member of the cast must be on his
mettle.

*Actress*. Your arrangements are perfect. Nothing will go wrong.

*Director* (*smiling*). To tell the truth, madam,

Until the wise are satisfied,  
  I cannot feel that skill is shown;  
The best-trained mind requires support,  
  And does not trust itself alone.

*Actress*. True. What shall we do first?

*Director*. First, you must sing something to please the ears of the
audience.

*Actress*. What season of the year shall I sing about?

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

*Director*. Why, sing about the pleasant summer which has just begun.
For at this time of year

A mid-day plunge will temper heat;  
  The breeze is rich with forest flowers;  
To slumber in the shade is sweet;  
  And charming are the twilight hours.

*Actress* (*sings*).

The siris-blossoms fair,  
  With pollen laden,  
Are plucked to deck her hair  
  By many a maiden,  
But gently; flowers like these  
  Are kissed by eager bees.

*Director*. Well done! The whole theatre is captivated by your song, and
sits as if painted. What play shall we give them to keep their
good-will?

*Actress*. Why, you just told me we were to give a new play called
*Shakuntala and the ring*.

*Director*. Thank you for reminding me. For the moment I had quite
forgotten.

Your charming song had carried me away  
As the deer enticed the hero of our play.

(*Exeunt ambo*.)
