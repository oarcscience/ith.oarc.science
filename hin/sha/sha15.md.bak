### THE DYNASTY OF RAGHU

*The Dynasty of Raghu* is an epic poem in nineteen cantos. It consists
of 1564 stanzas, or something over six thousand lines of verse. The
subject is that great line of kings who traced their origin to the sun,
the famous "solar line" of Indian story. The bright particular star of
the solar line is Rama, the knight without fear and without reproach,
the Indian ideal of a gentleman. His story had been told long before
Kalidasa's time in the *Ramayana*, an epic which does not need to shun
comparison with the foremost epic poems of Europe. In *The Dynasty of
Raghu*, too, Rama is the central figure; yet in Kalidasa's poem there is
much detail concerning other princes of the line. The poem thus
naturally falls into three great parts: first, the four immediate
ancestors of Rama (cantos 1-9); second, Rama (cantos 10-15); third,
certain descendants of Rama (cantos 16-19). A somewhat detailed account
of the matter of the poem may well precede criticism and comment.

 

*First canto. The journey to the hermitage*.--The poem begins with the
customary brief prayer for Shiva's favour:

God Shiva and his mountain bride,  
Like word and meaning unified,  
The world's great parents, I beseech  
To join fit meaning to my speech.

\[paragraph continues\] Then follow nine stanzas in which Kalidasa
speaks more directly of himself than elsewhere in his works:

How great is Raghu's solar line!  
How feebly small are powers of mine!  
As if upon the ocean's swell  
I launched a puny cockle-shell. <span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

The fool who seeks a poet's fame  
Must look for ridicule and blame,  
Like tiptoe dwarf who fain would try  
To pluck the fruit for giants high.

Yet I may enter through the door  
That mightier poets pierced of yore;  
A thread may pierce a jewel, but  
Must follow where the diamond cut.

Of kings who lived as saints from birth,  
Who ruled to ocean-shore on earth,  
Who toiled until success was given,  
Whose chariots stormed the gates of heaven,

Whose pious offerings were blest,  
Who gave his wish to every guest,  
Whose punishments were as the crimes,  
Who woke to guard the world betimes,

Who sought, that they might lavish, pelf,  
Whose measured speech was truth itself,  
Who fought victorious wars for fame,  
Who loved in wives the mother's name,

Who studied all good arts as boys,  
Who loved, in manhood, manhood's joys,  
Whose age was free from worldly care,  
Who breathed their lives away in prayer,

Of these I sing, of Raghu's line,  
Though weak mine art, and wisdom mine.  
Forgive these idle stammerings  
And think: For virtue's sake he sings.

The good who hear me will be glad  
To pluck the good from out the bad;  
When ore is proved by fire, the loss  
Is not of purest gold, but dross.

\[paragraph continues\] After the briefest glance at the origin of the
solar line, the

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

poet tells of Rama's great-great-grandfather, King Dilipa. The detailed
description of Dilipa's virtues has interest as showing Kalidasa's ideal
of an aristocrat; a brief sample must suffice here:

He practised virtue, though in health;  
Won riches, with no greed for wealth;  
Guarded his life, though not from fear;  
Prized joys of earth, but not too dear.

His virtuous foes he could esteem  
Like bitter drugs that healing seem;  
The friends who sinned he could forsake  
Like fingers bitten by a snake.

\[paragraph continues\] Yet King Dilipa has one deep-seated grief: he
has no son. He therefore journeys with his queen to the hermitage of the
sage Vasishtha, in order to learn what they must do to propitiate an
offended fate. Their chariot rolls over country roads past fragrant
lotus-ponds and screaming peacocks and trustful deer, under archways
formed without supporting pillars by the cranes, through villages where
they receive the blessings of the people. At sunset they reach the
peaceful forest hermitage, and are welcomed by the sage. In response to
Vasishtha's benevolent inquiries, the king declares that all goes well
in the kingdom, and yet:

Until from this dear wife there springs  
A son as great as former kings,  
The seven islands of the earth  
And all their gems, are nothing worth.

The final debt, most holy one,  
Which still I owe to life--a son--  
Galls me as galls the cutting chain  
An elephant housed in dirt and pain.

\[paragraph continues\] Vasishtha tells the king that on a former
occasion he had offended the divine cow Fragrant, and had been cursed by
the cow to lack children until he had propitiated her own offspring.
While the sage is speaking, Fragrant's daughter

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

approaches, and is entrusted to the care of the king and queen.

 

*Second canto. The holy cow's gift*.--During twenty-one days the king
accompanies the cow during her wanderings in the forest, and each night
the queen welcomes their return to the hermitage. On the twenty-second
day the cow is attacked by a lion, and when the king hastens to draw an
arrow, his arm is magically numbed, so that he stands help- less. To
increase his horror, the lion speaks with a human voice, saying that he
is a servant of the god Shiva, set on guard there and eating as his
appointed food any animals that may appear. Dilipa perceives that a
struggle with earthly weapons is useless, and begs the lion to accept
his own body as the price of the cow's release. The lion tries
sophistry, using the old, hollow arguments:

Great beauty and fresh youth are yours; on earth  
  As sole, unrivalled emperor you rule;  
Should you redeem a thing of little worth  
  At such a price, you would appear a fool.

If pity moves you, think that one mere cow  
  Would be the gainer, should you choose to die;  
Live rather for the world! Remember how  
  The father-king can bid all dangers fly.

And if the fiery sage's wrath, aglow  
  At loss of one sole cow, should make you shudder,  
Appease his anger; for you can bestow  
  Cows by the million, each with pot-like udder.

Save life and youth; for to the dead are given  
  No long, unbroken years of joyous mirth;  
But riches and imperial power are heaven--  
  The gods have nothing that you lack on earth.

The lion spoke and ceased; but echo rolled  
  Forth from the caves wherein the sound was pent,  
As if the hills applauded manifold,  
  Repeating once again the argument.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Dilipa has no trouble in piercing this
sophistical argument, and again offers his own life, begging the lion to
spare the body of his fame rather than the body of his flesh. The lion
consents, but when the king resolutely presents himself to be eaten, the
illusion vanishes, and the holy cow grants the king his desire. The king
returns to his capital with the queen, who shortly becomes pregnant.

 

*Third canto. Raghu's consecration*.--The queen gives birth to a
glorious boy, whom the joyful father names Raghu. There follows a
description of the happy family, of which a few stanzas are given here:

The king drank pleasure from him late and soon  
  With eyes that stared like windless lotus-flowers;  
  Unselfish joy expanded all his powers  
As swells the sea responsive to the moon.

The rooted love that filled each parent's soul  
  For the other, deep as bird's love for the mate,  
  Was now divided with the boy; and straight  
The remaining half proved greater than the whole.

He learned the reverence that befits a boy;  
  Following the nurse's words, began to talk;  
  And clinging to her finger, learned to walk:  
These childish lessons stretched his father's joy,

Who clasped the baby to his breast, and thrilled  
  To feel the nectar-touch upon his skin,  
  Half closed his eyes, the father's bliss to win  
Which, more for long delay, his being filled.

The baby hair must needs be clipped; yet he  
  Retained two dangling locks, his cheeks to fret;  
  And down the river of the alphabet  
He swam, with other boys, to learning's sea.

Religion's rites, and what good learning suits  
  A prince, he had from teachers old and wise;  
  Not theirs the pain of barren enterprise,  
For effort spent on good material, fruits.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

\[paragraph continues\] This happy childhood is followed by a youth
equally happy. Raghu is married and made crown prince. He is entrusted
with the care of the horse of sacrifice, <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) and when Indra, king of the gods, steals the
horse, Raghu fights him. He cannot overcome the king of heaven, yet he
acquits himself so creditably that he wins Indra's friendship. In
consequence of this proof of his manhood, the empire is bestowed upon
Raghu by his father, who retires with his queen to the forest, to spend
his last days and prepare for death.

 

*Fourth canto. Raghu conquers the world*.--The canto opens with several
stanzas descriptive of the glory of youthful King Raghu.

He manifested royal worth  
By even justice toward the earth,  
Beloved as is the southern breeze,  
Too cool to burn, too warm to freeze.

The people loved his father, yet  
For greater virtues could forget;  
The beauty of the blossoms fair  
Is lost when mango-fruits are there.

\[paragraph continues\] But the vassal kings are restless

For when they knew the king was gone  
And power was wielded by his son,  
The wrath of subject kings awoke,  
Which had been damped in sullen smoke.

Raghu therefore determines to make a warlike progress through all India.
He marches eastward with his army from his capital Ayodhya (the name is
preserved in the modern

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Oudh) to the Bay of Bengal, then south along the
eastern shore of India to Cape Comorin, then north along the western
shore until he comes to the region drained by the Indus, finally east
through the tremendous Himalaya range into Assam, and thence home. The
various nations whom he encounters, Hindus, Persians, Greeks, and White
Huns, all submit either with or without fighting. On his safe return,
Raghu offers a great sacrifice and gives away all his wealth. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

 

*Fifth canto. Aja goes wooing*.--While King Raghu is penniless, a young
sage comes to him, desiring a huge sum of money to give to the teacher
with whom he has just finished his education. The king, unwilling that
any suppliant should go away unsatisfied, prepares to assail the god of
wealth in his Himalayan stronghold, and the god, rather than risk the
combat, sends a rain of gold into the king's treasury. This gold King
Raghu bestows upon the sage, who gratefully uses his spiritual power to
cause a son to be born to his benefactor. In course of time, the son is
born and the name Aja is given to him. We are here introduced to Prince
Aja, who is a kind of secondary hero in the poem, inferior only to his
mighty grandson, Rama. To Aja are devoted the remainder of this fifth
canto and the following three cantos; and these Aja-cantos are among the
loveliest in the epic. When the prince has grown into young manhood, he
journeys to a neighbouring court to participate in the marriage
reception of Princess Indumati. <span id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_8.md) One
evening he camps by a river, from which a wild elephant issues and
attacks his party. When wounded by Aja, the elephant strangely changes
his form, becoming a demigod, gives the prince a magic weapon, and
departs to heaven. Aja proceeds

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

without further adventure to the country and the palace of Princess
Indumati, where he is made welcome and luxuriously lodged for the night.
In the morning, he is awakened by the song of the court poets outside
his chamber. He rises and betakes himself to the hall where the suitors
are gathering.

 

*Sixth canto. The princess chooses*.--The princely suitors assemble in
the hall; then, to the sound of music, the princess enters in a litter,
robed as a bride, and creates a profound sensation.

For when they saw God's masterpiece, the maid  
  Who smote their eyes to other objects blind,  
Their glances, wishes, hearts, in homage paid,  
  Flew forth to her; mere flesh remained behind.

The princes could not but betray their yearning  
  By sending messengers, their love to bring,  
In many a quick, involuntary turning,  
  As flowering twigs of trees announce the spring.

\[paragraph continues\] Then a maid-servant conducts the princess from
one suitor to another, and explains the claim which each has upon her
affection. First is presented the King of Magadha, recommended in four
stanzas, one of which runs:

Though other kings by thousands numbered be,  
He seems the one, sole governor of earth;  
Stars, constellations, planets, fade and flee  
When to the moon the night has given birth,

\[paragraph continues\] But the princess is not attracted.

The slender maiden glanced at him; she glanced  
  And uttered not a word, nor heeded how  
The grass-twined blossoms of her garland danced  
  When she dismissed him with a formal bow.

\[paragraph continues\] They pass to the next candidate, the king of the
Anga country, in whose behalf this, and more, is said:

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

Learning and wealth by nature are at strife,  
  Yet dwell at peace in him; and for the two  
You would be fit companion as his wife,  
  Like wealth enticing, and like learning true.

\[paragraph continues\] Him too the princess rejects, "not that he was
unworthy of love, or she lacking in discernment, but tastes differ." She
is then conducted to the King of Avanti:

And if this youthful prince your fancy pleases,  
  Bewitching maiden, you and he may play  
In those unmeasured gardens that the breezes  
  From Sipra's billows ruffle, cool with spray.

\[paragraph continues\] The inducement is insufficient, and a new
candidate is presented, the King of Anupa,

A prince whose fathers' glories cannot fade,  
  By whom the love of learned men is wooed,  
Who proves that Fortune is no fickle jade  
  When he she chooses is not fickly good.

\[paragraph continues\] But alas!

She saw that he was brave to look upon,  
  Yet could not feel his love would make her gay;  
Full moons of autumn nights, when clouds are gone,  
  Tempt not the lotus-flowers that bloom by day.

\[paragraph continues\] The King of Shurasena has no better fortune, in
spite of his virtues and his wealth. As a river hurrying to the sea
passes by a mountain that would detain her, so the princess passes him
by. She is next introduced to the king of the Kalinga country;

His palace overlooks the ocean dark  
  With windows gazing on the unresting deep,  
Whose gentle thunders drown the drums that mark  
  The hours of night, and wake him from his sleep.

\[paragraph continues\] But the maiden can no more feel at home with him
than the

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

goddess of fortune can with a good but unlucky man. She therefore turns
her attention to the king of the Pandya country in far southern India.
But she is unmoved by hearing of the magic charm of the south, and
rejects him too.

And every prince rejected while she sought  
  A husband, darkly frowned, as turrets, bright  
One moment with the flame from torches caught,  
  Frown gloomily again and sink in night.

\[paragraph continues\] The princess then approaches Aja, who trembles
lest she pass him by, as she has passed by the other suitors. The maid
who accompanies Indumati sees that Aja awakens a deeper feeling, and she
therefore gives a longer account of his kingly line, ending with the
recommendation:

High lineage is his, fresh beauty, youth,  
  And virtue shaped in kingly breeding's mould;  
Choose him, for he is worth your love; in truth,  
  A gem is ever fitly set in gold.

The princess looks lovingly at the handsome youth, but cannot speak for
modesty. She is made to understand her own feelings when the maid
invites her to pass on to the next candidate. Then the wreath is placed
round Aja's neck, the people of the city shout their approval, and the
disappointed suitors feel like night-blooming lotuses at daybreak.

 

*Seventh canto. Aja's marriage*.--While the suitors retire to the camps
where they have left their retainers, Aja conducts Indumati into the
decorated and festive city. The windows are filled with the faces of
eager and excited women, who admire the beauty of the young prince and
the wisdom of the princess's choice. When the marriage ceremony has been
happily celebrated, the disappointed suitors say farewell  with pleasant
faces and jealous hearts, like peaceful pools concealing crocodiles.
They lie in ambush on the road which he must take, and when he passes
with his young bride, they fall upon him. Aja provides for the safety of
Indumati, marshals his attendants, and greatly distinguishes himself in
the battle which follows. Finally he uses the magic weapon,

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

given him by the demigod, to benumb his adversaries, and leaving them in
this helpless condition, returns home. He and his young bride are
joyfully welcomed by King Raghu, who resigns the kingdom in favour of
Aja.

 

*Eighth canto. Aja's lament*.--As soon as King Aja is firmly established
on his throne, Raghu retires to a hermitage to prepare for the death of
his mortal part. After some years of religious meditation he is
released, attaining union with the eternal spirit which is beyond all
darkness. His obsequies are performed by his dutiful son. Indumati gives
birth to a splendid boy, who is named Dasharatha. One day, as the queen
is playing with her husband in the garden, a wreath of magic flowers
falls upon her from heaven, and she dies. The stricken king clasps the
body of his dead beloved, and laments over her.

If flowers that hardly touch the body, slay it,  
  The simplest instruments of fate may bring  
Destruction, and we have no power to stay it;  
  Then must we live in fear of everything?

No! Death was right. He spared the sterner anguish;  
  Through gentle flowers your gentle life was lost  
As I have seen the lotus fade and languish  
  When smitten by the slow and silent frost.

Yet God is hard. With unforgiving rigour  
  He forged a bolt to crush this heart of mine;  
He left the sturdy tree its living vigour,  
  But stripped away and slew the clinging vine.

Through all the years, dear, you would not reprove me,  
  Though I offended. Can you go away  
Sudden, without a word? I know you love me,  
  And I have not offended you to-day.

You surely thought me faithless, to be banished  
  As light-of-love and gambler, from your life,  
Because without a farewell word, you vanished  
  And never will return, sweet-smiling wife.

The warmth and blush that followed after kisses  
  Is still upon her face, to madden me;  
For life is gone, ’tis only life she misses.  
  A curse upon such life's uncertainty!

I never wronged you with a thought unspoken,  
  Still less with actions. Whither are you flown?  
Though king in name, I am a man heartbroken,  
  For power and love took root in you alone.

Your bee-black hair from which the flowers are peeping,  
  Dear, wavy hair that I have loved so well,  
Stirs in the wind until I think you sleeping,  
  Soon to return and make my glad heart swell.

Awake, my love! Let only life be given,  
  And choking griefs that stifle now, will flee  
As darkness from the mountain-cave is driven  
  By magic herbs that glitter brilliantly.

The silent face, round which the curls are keeping  
  Their scattered watch, is sad to look upon  
As in the night some lonely lily, sleeping  
  When musically humming bees are gone.

The girdle that from girlhood has befriended  
  You, in love-secrets wise, discreet, and true,  
No longer tinkles, now your dance is ended,  
  Faithful in life, in dying faithful too.

Your low, sweet voice to nightingales was given;  
  Your idly graceful movement to the swans;  
Your grace to fluttering vines, dear wife in heaven;  
  Your trustful, wide-eyed glances to the fawns:

You left your charms on earth, that I, reminded  
  By them, might be consoled though you depart;  
But vainly! Far from you, by sorrow blinded,  
  I find no prop of comfort for my heart.

Remember how you planned to make a wedding,  
  Giving the vine-bride to her mango-tree; <span id="page_135">p.
135</span>  
Before that happy day, dear, you are treading  
  The path with no return. It should not be.

And this ashoka-tree that you have tended  
  With eager longing for the blossoms red  
How can I twine the flowers that should have blended  
  With living curls, in garlands for the dead?

The tree remembers how the anklets, tinkling  
  On graceful feet, delighted other years;  
Sad now he droops, your form with sorrow sprinkling,  
  And sheds his blossoms in a rain of tears.

Joy's sun is down, all love is fallen and perished,  
  The song of life is sung, the spring is dead,  
Gone is the use of gems that once you cherished,  
  And empty, ever empty, is my bed.

You were my comrade gay, my home, my treasure,  
  You were my bosom's friend, in all things true,  
My best-loved pupil in the arts of pleasure:  
  Stern death took all I had in taking you.

Still am I king, and rich in kingly fashion,  
Yet lacking you, am poor the long years through;  
I cannot now be won to any passion,  
For all my passions centred, dear, in you.

\[paragraph continues\] Aja commits the body of his beloved queen to the
flames. A holy hermit comes to tell the king that his wife had been a
nymph of heaven in a former existence, and that she has now returned to
her home. But Aja cannot be comforted. He lives eight weary years for
the sake of his young son, then is reunited with his queen in Paradise.

 

*Ninth canto. The hunt*.--This canto introduces us to King Dasharatha,
father of the heroic Rama. It begins with an elaborate description of
his glory, justice, prowess, and piety; then tells of the three
princesses who became his wives: Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. In the
beautiful springtime he takes an extended hunting-trip in the forest,
during which an accident happens, big with fate.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

He left his soldiers far behind one day  
In the wood, and following where deer-tracks lay,  
Came with his weary horse adrip with foam  
To river-banks where hermits made their home.

And in the stream he heard the water fill  
A jar; he heard it ripple clear and shrill,  
And shot an arrow, thinking he had found  
A trumpeting elephant, toward the gurgling sound

Such actions are forbidden to a king,  
Yet Dasharatha sinned and did this thing;  
For even the wise and learned man is minded  
To go astray, by selfish passion blinded.

He heard the startling cry, "My father!" rise  
Among the reeds; rode up; before his eyes  
He saw the jar, the wounded hermit boy:  
Remorse transfixed his heart and killed his joy.

He left his horse, this monarch famous far,  
Asked him who drooped upon the water-jar  
His name, and from the stumbling accents knew  
A hermit youth, of lowly birth but true.

The arrow still undrawn, the monarch bore  
Him to his parents who, afflicted sore  
With blindness, could not see their only son  
Dying, and told them what his hand had done.

The murderer then obeyed their sad behest  
And drew the fixèd arrow from his breast;  
The boy lay dead; the father cursed the king,  
With tear-stained hands, to equal suffering.

"In sorrow for your son you too shall die,  
An old, old man," he said, "as sad as I."  
Poor, trodden snake! He used his venomous sting,  
Then heard the answer of the guilty king:

"Your curse is half a blessing if I see  
The longed-for son who shall be born to me: <span id="page_137">p.
137</span>  
The scorching fire that sweeps the well-ploughed field,  
May burn indeed, but stimulates the yield.

The deed is done; what kindly act can I  
Perform who, pitiless, deserve to die?"  
"Bring wood," he begged, "and build a funeral pyre,  
That we may seek our son through death by fire."

The king fulfilled their wish; and while they burned,  
In mute, sin-stricken sorrow he returned,  
Hiding death's seed within him, as the sea  
Hides magic fire that burns eternally.

\[paragraph continues\] Thus is foreshadowed the birth of Rama, his
banishment, and the death of his father.

Cantos ten to fifteen form the kernel of the epic, for they tell the
story of Rama, the mighty hero of Raghu's line. In these cantos Kalidasa
attempts to present anew, with all the literary devices of a more
sophisticated age, the famous old epic story sung in masterly fashion by
the author of the *Ramayana*. As the poet is treading ground familiar to
all who hear him, the action of these cantos is very compressed.

 

*Tenth canto. The incarnation of Rama*.--While Dasharatha, desiring a
son, is childless, the gods, oppressed by a giant adversary, betake
themselves to Vishnu, seeking aid. They sing a hymn of praise, a part of
which is given here.

O thou who didst create this All,  
Who dost preserve it, lest it fall,  
Who wilt destroy it and its ways--  
To thee, O triune Lord, be praise.

As into heaven's water run  
The tastes of earth--yet it is one,  
So thou art all the things that range  
The universe, yet dost not change.

Far, far removed, yet ever near;  
Untouched by passion, yet austere; <span id="page_138">p. 138</span>  
Sinless, yet pitiful of heart;  
Ancient, yet free from age--Thou art.

Though uncreate, thou seekest birth;  
Dreaming, thou watchest heaven and earth;  
Passionless, smitest low thy foes;  
Who knows thy nature, Lord? Who knows?

Though many different paths, O Lord,  
May lead us to some great reward,  
They gather and are merged in thee  
Like floods of Ganges in the sea.

The saints who give thee every thought,  
Whose every act for thee is wrought,  
Yearn for thine everlasting peace,  
For bliss with thee, that cannot cease.

Like pearls that grow in ocean's night,  
Like sunbeams radiantly bright,  
Thy strange and wonder-working ways  
Defeat extravagance of praise.

If songs that to thy glory tend  
Should weary grow or take an end,  
Our impotence must bear the blame,  
And not thine unexhausted name.

\[paragraph continues\] Vishnu is gratified by the praise of the gods,
and asks their desire. They inform him that they are distressed by
Ravana, the giant king of Lanka (Ceylon), whom they cannot conquer.
Vishnu promises to aid them by descending to earth in a new avatar, as
son of Dasharatha. Shortly afterwards, an angel appears before King
Dasharatha, bringing in a golden bowl a substance which contains the
essence of Vishnu. The king gives it to his three wives, who thereupon
conceive and dream wonderful dreams. Then Queen Kausalya gives birth to
Rama; Queen Kaikeyi to Bharata; Queen Sumitra to twins, Lakshmana and
Shatrughna. Heaven and earth rejoice. The four princes grow up in mutual
friendship, yet Rama and Lakshmana are peculiarly drawn to each

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

other, as are Bharata and Shatrughna. So beautiful and so modest are the
four boys that they seem like incarnations of the four things worth
living for--virtue, money, love, and salvation.

 

*Eleventh canto. The victory over Rama-with-the-axe*.--At the request of
the holy hermit Vishvamitra, the two youths Rama and Lakshmana visit his
hermitage, to protect it from evil spirits. The two lads little suspect,
on their maiden journey, how much of their lives will be spent in
wandering together in the forest. On the way they are attacked by a
giantess, whom Rama kills; the first of many giants who are to fall at
his hand. He is given magic weapons by the hermit, with which he and his
brother kill other giants, freeing the hermitage from all annoyance. The
two brothers then travel with the hermit to the city of Mithila,
attracted thither by hearing of its king, his wonderful daughter, and
his wonderful bow. The bow was given him by the god Shiva; no man has
been able to bend it; and the beautiful princess's hand is the prize of
any man who can perform the feat. On the way thither, Rama brings to
life Ahalya, a woman who in a former age had been changed to stone for
unfaithfulness to her austere husband, and had been condemned to remain
a stone until trodden by Rama's foot. Without further adventure, they
reach Mithila, where the hermit presents Rama as a candidate for the
bending of the bow.

The king beheld the boy, with beauty blest  
  And famous lineage; he sadly thought  
How hard it was to bend the bow, distressed  
  Because his child must be so dearly bought.

He said: "O holy one, a mighty deed  
  That full-grown elephants with greatest pain  
Could hardly be successful in, we need  
  Not ask of elephant-cubs. It would be vain.

For many splendid kings of valorous name,  
  Bearing the scars of many a hard-fought day,  
Have tried and failed; then, covered with their shame,  
  Have shrugged their shoulders, cursed, and strode away."

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Yet when the bow is given to the youthful Rama,
he not only bends, but breaks it. He is immediately rewarded with the
hand of the Princess Sita, while Lakshmana marries her sister. On their
journey home with their young brides, dreadful portents appear, followed
by their cause, a strange being called Rama-with-the-axe, who is
carefully to be distinguished from Prince Rama. This Rama-with-the-axe
is a Brahman who has sworn to exterminate the entire warrior caste, and
who naturally attacks the valorous prince. He makes light of Rama's
achievement in breaking Shiva's bow, and challenges him to bend the
mightier bow which he carries. This the prince succeeds in doing, and
Rama-with-the-axe disappears, shamed and defeated. The marriage party
then continues its journey to Ayodhya.

 

*Twelfth canto. The killing of Ravana*.--King Dasharatha prepares to
anoint Rama crown prince, when Queen Kaikeyi interposes. On an earlier
occasion she had rendered the king a service and received his promise
that he would grant her two boons, whatever she desired. She now demands
her two boons: the banishment of Rama for fourteen years, and the
anointing of her own son Bharata as crown prince. Rama thereupon sets
out for the Dandaka forest in Southern India, accompanied by his
faithful wife Sita and his devoted brother Lakshmana. The stricken
father dies of grief, thus fulfilling the hermit's curse. Now Prince
Bharata proves himself more generous than his mother; he refuses the
kingdom, and is with great difficulty persuaded by Rama himself to act
as regent during the fourteen years. Even so, he refuses to enter the
capital city, dwelling in a village outside the walls, and preserving
Rama's slippers as a symbol of the rightful king. Meanwhile Rama's
little party penetrates the wild forests of the south, fighting as need
arises with the giants there. Unfortunately, a giantess falls in love
with Rama, and

In Sita's very presence told  
Her birth--love made her overbold:  
For mighty passion, as a rule,  
Will change a woman to a fool.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Scorned by Rama, laughed at by Sita, she becomes
furious and threatening.

Laugh on! Your laughter's fruit shall be  
Commended to you. Gaze on me!  
I am a tigress, you shall know,  
Insulted by a feeble doe.

\[paragraph continues\] Lakshmana thereupon cuts off her nose and ears,
rendering her redundantly hideous. She departs, to return presently at
the head of an army of giants, whom Rama defeats single-handed, while
his brother guards Sita. The giantess then betakes herself to her
brother, the terrible ten-headed Ravana, king of Ceylon. He succeeds in
capturing Sita by a trick, and carries her off to his fortress in
Ceylon. It is plainly necessary for Rama to seek allies before
attempting to cross the straits and attack the stronghold. He therefore
renders an important service to the monkey king Sugriva, who gratefully
leads an army of monkeys to his assistance. The most valiant of these,
Hanumat, succeeds in entering Ravana's capital, where he finds Sita,
gives her a token from Rama, and receives a token for Rama. The army
thereupon sets out and comes to the seashore, where it is reinforced by
the giant Vibhishana, who has deserted his wicked brother Ravana. The
monkeys hurl great boulders into the strait, thus forming a bridge over
which they cross into Ceylon and besiege Ravana's capital. There ensue
many battles between the giants and the monkeys, culminating in a
tremendous duel between the champions, Rama and Ravana. In this duel
Ravana is finally slain. Rama recovers his wife, and the principal
personages of the army enter the flying chariot which had belonged to
Ravana, to return to Ayodhya; for the fourteen years of exile are now
over.

 

*Thirteenth canto. The return from the forest*.--This canto describes
the long journey through the air from Ceylon over the whole length of
India to Ayodhya. As the celestial car makes its journey, Rama points
out the objects of interest or of memory to Sita. Thus, as they fly over
the sea:

The form of ocean, infinitely changing,  
  Clasping the world and all its gorgeous state, <span id="page_142">p.
142</span>  
Unfathomed by the intellect's wide ranging,  
  Is awful like the form of God, and great.

He gives his billowy lips to many a river  
  That into his embrace with passion slips,  
Lover of many wives, a generous giver  
  Of kisses, yet demanding eager lips.

Look back, my darling, with your fawn-like glances  
  Upon the path that from your prison leads;  
See how the sight of land again entrances,  
  How fair the forest, as the sea recedes.

\[paragraph continues\] Then, as they pass over the spot where Rama
searched for his stolen wife:

There is the spot where, sorrowfully searching,  
  I found an anklet on the ground one day;  
It could not tinkle, for it was not perching  
  On your dear foot, but sad and silent lay.

I learned where you were carried by the giant  
  From vines that showed themselves compassionate;  
They could not utter words, yet with their pliant  
  Branches they pointed where you passed of late.

The deer were kind; for while the juicy grasses  
  Fell quite unheeded from each careless mouth,  
They turned wide eyes that said, "’Tis there she passes  
  The hours as weary captive" toward the south.

There is the mountain where the peacocks' screaming,  
  And branches smitten fragrant by the rain,  
And madder-flowers that woke at last from dreaming,  
  Made unendurable my lonely pain;

And mountain-caves where I could scarce dissemble  
  The woe I felt when thunder crashed anew,  
For I remembered how you used to tremble  
  At thunder, seeking arms that longed for you.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Rama then points out the spots in Southern India
where he and Sita had dwelt in exile, and the pious hermitages which
they had visited; later, the holy spot where the Jumna River joins the
Ganges; finally, their distant home, unseen for fourteen years, and the
well-known river, from which spray-laden breezes come to them like cool,
welcoming hands. When they draw near, Prince Bharata comes forth to
welcome them, and the happy procession approaches the capital city.

 

*Fourteenth canto. Sita is put away*.--The exiles are welcomed by Queen
Kausalya and Queen Sumitra with a joy tinged with deep melancholy. After
the long-deferred anointing of Rama as king, comes the triumphal entry
into the ancestral capital, where Rama begins his virtuous reign with
his beloved queen most happily; for the very hardships endured in the
forest turn into pleasures when remembered in the palace. To crown the
king's joy, Sita becomes pregnant, and expresses a wish to visit the
forest again. At this point, where an ordinary story would end, comes
the great tragedy, the tremendous test of Rama's character. The people
begin to murmur about the queen, believing that she could not have
preserved her purity in the giant's palace. Rama knows that she is
innocent, but he also knows that he cannot be a good king while the
people feel as they do; and after a pitiful struggle, he decides to put
away his beloved wife. He bids his brother Lakshmana take her to the
forest, in accordance with her request, but to leave her there at the
hermitage of the sage Valmiki. When this is done, and Sita hears the
terrible future from Lakshmana, she cries:

Take reverent greeting to the queens, my mothers,  
  And say to each with honour due her worth:  
"My child is your son's child, and not another's;  
  Oh, pray for him, before he comes to birth."

And tell the king from me: "You saw the matter,  
  How I was guiltless proved in fire divine;  
Will you desert me for mere idle chatter?  
  Are such things done in Raghu's royal line? <span id="page_144">p.
144</span>

Ah no! I cannot think you fickle-minded,  
  For you were always very kind to me;  
Fate's thunderclap by which my eyes are blinded  
  Rewards my old, forgotten sins, I see.

Oh, I could curse my life and quickly end it,  
  For it is useless, lived from you apart,  
But that I bear within, and must defend it,  
  Your life, your child and mine, beneath my heart.

When he is born, I'll scorn my queenly station,  
  Gaze on the sun, and live a hell on earth,  
That I may know no pain of separation  
  From you, my husband, in another birth,

My king! Eternal duty bids you never  
  Forget a hermit who for sorrow faints;  
Though I am exiled from your bed for ever,  
  I claim the care you owe to all the saints."

\[paragraph continues\] So she accepts her fate with meek courage. But

When Rama's brother left her there to languish  
  And bore to them she loved her final word,  
She loosed her throat in an excess of anguish  
  And screamed as madly as a frightened bird.

Trees shed their flowers, the peacock-dances ended,  
  The grasses dropped from mouths of feeding deer,  
As if the universal forest blended  
  Its tears with hers, and shared her woeful fear.

While she laments thus piteously, she is discovered by the poet-sage
Valmiki, who consoles her with tender and beautiful words, and conducts
her to his hermitage, where she awaits the time of her confinement.
Meanwhile Rama leads a dreary life, finding duty but a cold comforter.
He makes a golden statue of his wife, and will not look at other women.

 

*Fifteenth canto. Rama goes to heaven*.--The canto opens with a rather
long description of a fight between Rama's youngest brother and a giant.
On the journey to meet the

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

giant, Shatrughna spends a night in Valmiki's hermitage, and that very
night Sita gives birth to twin sons. Valmiki gives them the names Kusha
and Lava, and when they grow out of childhood he teaches them his own
composition, the Ramayana, "the sweet story of Rama," "the first path
shown to poets." At this time the young son of a Brahman dies in the
capital, and the father laments at the king's gate, for he believes that
the king is unworthy, else heaven would not send death prematurely. Rama
is roused to stamp out evil-doing in the kingdom, whereupon the dead boy
comes to life. The king then feels that his task on earth is nearly
done, and prepares to celebrate the great horse-sacrifice. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) At this sacrifice appear the two youths
Kusha and Lava, who sing the epic of Rama's deeds in the presence of
Rama himself. The father perceives their likeness to himself, then
learns that they are indeed his children, whom he has never seen.
Thereupon Sita is brought forward by the poet-sage Valmiki and in the
presence of her husband and her detractors establishes her constant
purity in a terrible fashion.

"If I am faithful to my lord  
In thought, in action, and in word,  
I pray that Earth who bears us all  
May bid me in her bosom fall."

The faithful wife no sooner spoke  
Than earth divided, and there broke  
From deep within a flashing light  
That flamed like lightning, blinding-bright.

And, seated on a splendid throne  
Upheld by serpents' hoods alone,  
The goddess Earth rose visibly,  
And she was girded with the sea.

Sita was clasped in her embrace,  
While still she gazed on Rama's face:  
He cried aloud in wild despair;  
She sank, and left him standing there.

\[paragraph continues\] Rama then establishes his brothers, sons, and
nephews in

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

different cities of the kingdom, buries the three queens of his father,
and awaits death. He has not long to wait; Death comes, wearing a
hermit's garb, asks for a private interview, and threatens any who shall
disturb their conference. Lakshmana disturbs them, and so dies before
Rama. Then Rama is translated.

Cantos sixteen to nineteen form the third division of the epic, and
treat of Rama's descendants. The interest wanes, for the great hero is
gone.

 

*Sixteenth canto. Kumudvati's wedding*.--As Kusha lies awake one night,
a female figure appears in his chamber; and in answer to his question,
declares that she is the presiding goddess of the ancient capital
Ayodhya, which has been deserted since Rama's departure to heaven. She
pictures the sad state of the city thus:

I have no king; my towers and terraces  
  Crumble and fall; my walls are overthrown;  
As when the ugly winds of evening seize  
  The rack of clouds in helpless darkness blown.

In streets where maidens gaily passed at night,  
  Where once was known the tinkle and the shine  
Of anklets, jackals slink, and by the light  
  Of flashing fangs, seek carrion, snarl, and whine.

The water of the pools that used to splash  
  With drumlike music, under maidens' hands,  
Groans now when bisons from the jungle lash  
  It with their clumsy horns, and roil its sands.

The peacock-pets are wild that once were tame;  
  They roost on trees, not perches; lose desire  
For dancing to the drums; and feel no shame  
  For fans singed close by sparks of forest-fire.

On stairways where the women once were glad  
  To leave their pink and graceful footprints, here  
Unwelcome, blood-stained paws of tigers pad,  
  Fresh-smeared from slaughter of the forest deer. <span
id="page_147">p. 147</span>

Wall-painted elephants in lotus-brooks,  
  Receiving each a lily from his mate,  
Are torn and gashed, as if by cruel hooks,  
  By claws of lions, showing furious hate.

I see my pillared caryatides  
  Neglected, weathered, stained by passing time,  
Wearing in place of garments that should please,  
  The skins of sloughing cobras, foul with slime.

The balconies grow black with long neglect,  
  And grass-blades sprout through floors no longer tight;  
They still receive but cannot now reflect  
  The old, familiar moonbeams, pearly white.

The vines that blossomed in my garden bowers,  
  That used to show their graceful beauty, when  
Girls gently bent their twigs and plucked their flowers,  
  Are broken by wild apes and wilder men.

The windows are not lit by lamps at night,  
  Nor by fair faces shining in the day,  
But webs of spiders dim the delicate, light  
  Smoke-tracery with one mere daub of grey.

The river is deserted; on the shore  
  No gaily bathing men and maidens leave  
Food for the swans; its reedy bowers no more  
  Are vocal: seeing this, I can but grieve.

\[paragraph continues\] The goddess therefore begs Kusha to return with
his court to the old capital, and when he assents, she smiles and
vanishes. The next morning Kusha announces the vision of the night, and
immediately sets out for Ayodhya with his whole army. Arrived there,
King Kusha quickly restores the city to its former splendour. Then when
the hot summer comes, the king goes down to the river to bathe with the
ladies of the court. While in the water he loses a great gem which his
father had given him. The divers are unable to find it, and declare
their belief that it has been stolen by the serpent Kumuda who lives in
the river. The king

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

threatens to shoot an arrow into the river, whereupon the waters divide,
and the serpent appears with the gem. He is accompanied by a beautiful
maiden, whom he introduces as his sister Kumudvati, and whom he offers
in marriage to Kusha. The offer is accepted, and the wedding celebrated
with great pomp.

 

*Seventeenth canto. King Atithi*.--To the king and queen is born a son,
who is named Atithi. When he has grown into manhood, his father Kusha
engages in a struggle with a demon, in which the king is killed in the
act of killing his adversary. He goes to heaven, followed by his
faithful queen, and Atithi is anointed king. The remainder of the canto
describes King Atithi's glorious reign.

 

*Eighteenth canto. The later princes*.--This canto gives a brief,
impressionistic sketch of the twenty-one kings who in their order
succeeded Atithi.

 

*Nineteenth canto. The loves of Agnivarna*.--After the twenty-one kings
just mentioned, there succeeds a king named Agnivarna, who gives himself
to dissipation. He shuts himself up in the palace; even when duty
requires him to appear before his subjects, he does so merely by hanging
one foot out of a window. He trains dancing-girls himself, and has so
many mistresses that he cannot always call them by their right names. It
is not wonderful that this kind of life leads before long to a consuming
disease; and as Agnivarna is even then unable to resist the pleasures of
the senses, he dies. His queen is pregnant, and she mounts the throne as
regent in behalf of her unborn son. With this strange scene, half
tragic, half vulgar, the epic, in the form in which it has come down to
us, abruptly ends.

If we now endeavour to form some critical estimate of the poem, we are
met at the outset by this strangely unnatural termination. We cannot
avoid wondering whether the poem as we have it is complete. And we shall
find that there are good reasons for believing that Kalidasa did not let
the glorious solar line end in the person of the voluptuous Agnivarna
and his unborn child. In the first place, there is a constant tradition
which affirms that *The Dynasty of Raghu* 

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

originally consisted of twenty-five cantos. A similar tradition
concerning Kalidasa's second epic has justified itself; for some time
only seven cantos were known; then more were discovered, and we now have
seventeen. Again, there is a rhetorical rule, almost never disregarded,
which requires a literary work to end with an epilogue in the form of a
little prayer for the welfare of readers or auditors. Kalidasa himself
complies with this rule, certainly in five of his other six books. Once
again, Kalidasa has nothing of the tragedian in his soul; his works,
without exception, end happily. In the drama *Urvashi* he seriously
injures a splendid old tragic story for the sake of a happy ending.
These facts all point to the probability that the conclusion of the epic
has been lost. We may even assign a natural, though conjectural, reason
for this. *The Dynasty of Raghu* has been used for centuries as a
text-book in India, so that manuscripts abound, and commentaries are
very numerous. Now if the concluding cantos were unfitted for use as a
text-book, they might very easily be lost during the centuries before
the introduction of printing-presses into India. Indeed, this very
unfitness for use as a school text seems to be the explanation of the
temporary loss of several cantos of Kalidasa's second epic.

On the other hand, we are met by the fact that numerous commentators,
living in different parts of India, know the text of only nineteen
cantos. Furthermore, it is unlikely that Kalidasa left the poem
incomplete at his death; for it was, without serious question, one of
his earlier works. Apart from evidences of style, there is the
subject-matter of the introductory stanzas, in which the poet presents
himself as an aspirant for literary fame. No writer of established
reputation would be likely to say:

The fool who seeks a poet's fame,  
Must look for ridicule and blame,  
Like tiptoe dwarf who fain would try  
To pluck the fruit for giants high.

\[paragraph continues\] In only one other of his writings, in the drama
which was undoubtedly written earlier than the other two dramas, does
the poet thus present his feeling of diffidence to his auditors.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

It is of course possible that Kalidasa wrote the first nineteen cantos
when a young man, intending to add more, then turned to other matters,
and never afterwards cared to take up the rather thankless task of
ending a youthful work.

The question does not admit of final solution. Yet who-ever reads and
re-reads *The Dynasty of Raghu*, and the other works of its author,
finds the conviction growing ever stronger that our poem in nineteen
cantos is mutilated. We are thus enabled to clear the author of the
charge of a lame and impotent conclusion.

Another adverse criticism cannot so readily be disposed of; that of a
lack of unity in the plot. As the poem treats of a kingly dynasty, we
frequently meet the cry: The king is dead. Long live the king! The story
of Rama himself occupies only six cantos; he is not born until the tenth
canto, he is in heaven after the fifteenth. There are in truth six
heroes, each of whom has to die to make room for his successor. One may
go farther and say that it is not possible to give a brief and accurate
title to the poem. It is not a Ramayana, or epic of Rama's deeds, for
Rama is on the stage during only a third of the poem. It is not properly
an epic of Raghu's line, for many kings of this line are unmentioned.
Not merely kings who escape notice by their obscurity, but also several
who fill a large place in Indian story, whose deeds and adventures are
splendidly worthy of epic treatment. *The Dynasty of Raghu* is rather an
epic poem in which Rama is the central figure, giving it such unity as
it possesses, but which provides Rama with a most generous background in
the shape of selected episodes concerning his ancestors and his
descendants.

Rama is the central figure. Take him away and the poem falls to pieces
like a pearl necklace with a broken string. Yet it may well be doubted
whether the cantos dealing with Rama are the most successful. They are
too compressed, too briefly allusive. Kalidasa attempts to tell the
story in about one-thirtieth of the space given to it by his great
predecessor Valmiki. The result is much loss by omission and much loss
by compression. Many of the best episodes of the Ramayana are quite
omitted by Kalidasa: for example; the story of the jealous humpback who
eggs on Queen Kaikeyi to demand her two boons; the beautiful scene in

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

which Sita insists on following Rama into the forest; the account of the
somnolent giant Pot-ear, a character quite as good as Polyphemus. Other
fine episodes are so briefly alluded to as to lose all their charm: for
example, the story of the golden deer that attracts the attention of
Rama while Ravana is stealing his wife; the journey of the monkey
Hanumat to Ravana's fortress and his interview with Sita.

The Rama-story, as told by Valmiki, is one of the great epic stories of
the world. It has been for two thousand years and more the story *par
excellence* of the Hindus; and the Hindus may fairly claim to be the
best story-tellers of the world. There is therefore real matter for
regret in the fact that so great a poet as Kalidasa should have treated
it in a way not quite worthy of it and of himself. The reason is not far
to seek, nor can there be any reasonable doubt as to its truth. Kalidasa
did not care to put himself into direct competition with Valmiki. The
younger poet's admiration of his mighty predecessor is clearly
expressed. It is with especial reference to Valmiki that he says in his
introduction:

Yet I may enter through the door  
That mightier poets pierced of yore;  
A thread may pierce a jewel, but  
Must follow where the diamond cut.

\[paragraph continues\] He introduces Valmiki into his own epic, making
him compose the *Ramayana* in Rama's lifetime. Kalidasa speaks of
Valmiki as "the poet," and the great epic he calls "the sweet story of
Rama," "the first path shown to poets," which, when sung by the two
boys, was heard with motionless delight by the deer, and, when sung
before a gathering of learned men, made them heedless of the tears that
rolled down their cheeks.

Bearing these matters in mind, we can see the course of Kalidasa's
thoughts almost as clearly as if he had expressed them directly. He was
irresistibly driven to write the wonderful story of Rama, as any poet
would be who became familiar with it. At the same time, his modesty
prevented him from challenging the old epic directly. He therefore
writes a poem which shall appeal to the hallowed associations

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

that cluster round the great name of Rama, but devotes two-thirds of it
to themes that permit him greater freedom. The result is a formless
plot.

This is a real weakness, yet not a fatal weakness. In general, literary
critics lay far too much emphasis on plot. Of the elements that make a
great book, two, style and presentation of character, hardly permit
critical analysis. The third, plot, does permit such analysis. Therefore
the analyst overrates its importance. It is fatal to all claim of
greatness in a narrative if it is shown to have a bad style or to be
without interesting characters. It is not fatal if it is shown that the
plot is rambling. In recent literature it is easy to find truly great
narratives in which the plot leaves much to be desired. We may cite the
*Pickwick Papers*, *Les Misérables*, *War and Peace*.

We must then regard *The Dynasty of Raghu* as a poem in which single
episodes take a stronger hold upon the reader than does the unfolding of
an ingenious plot. In some degree, this is true of all long poems. The
*Æneid* itself, the most perfect long poem ever written, has dull
passages. And when this allowance is made, what wonderful passages we
have in Kalidasa's poem! One hardly knows which of them makes the
strongest appeal, so many are they and so varied. There is the
description of the small boy Raghu in the third canto, the choice of the
princess in the sixth, the lament of King Aja in the eighth, the story
of Dasharatha and the hermit youth in the ninth, the account of the
ruined city in the sixteenth. Besides these, the Rama cantos, ten to
fifteen, make an epic within an epic. And if Kalidasa is not seen at his
very best here, yet his second best is of a higher quality than the best
of others. Also, the Rama story is so moving that a mere allusion to it
stirs like a sentimental memory of childhood. It has the usual qualities
of a good epic story: abundance of travel and fighting and adventure and
magic interweaving of human with superhuman, but it has more than this.
In both hero and heroine there is real development of character.
Odysseus and Æneas do not grow; they go through adventures. But King
Rama, torn between love for his wife and duty to his subjects, is almost
a different person from the handsome, light-hearted prince who won his
bride by breaking Shiva's bow. Sita, faithful

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

to the husband who rejects her, has made a long, character-forming
journey since the day when she left her father's palace, a youthful
bride. Herein lies the unique beauty of the tale of Rama, that it unites
romantic love and moral conflict with a splendid story of wild
adventure. No wonder that the Hindus, connoisseurs of story-telling,
have loved the tale of Rama's deeds better than any other story.

If we compare *The Dynasty of Raghu* with Kalidasa's other books, we
find it inferior to *The Birth of the War-god* in unity of plot,
inferior to *Shakuntala* in sustained interest, inferior to *The
Cloud-Messenger* in perfection of every detail. Yet passages in it are
as high and sweet as anything in these works. And over it is shed the
magic charm of Kalidasa's style. Of that it is vain to speak. It can be
had only at first hand. The final proof that *The Dynasty of Raghu* is a
very great poem, is this: no one who once reads it can leave it alone
thereafter.

title of emperor, or king of kings, he was at liberty to celebrate the
horse-sacrifice. A horse was set free to wander at will for a year, and
was escorted by a band of noble youths who were not permitted to
interfere with his movements. If the horse wandered into the territory
of another king, such king must either submit to be the vassal of the
horse's owner, or must fight him. If the owner of the horse received the
submission, with or without fighting, of all the kings into whose
territories the horse wandered during the year of freedom, he offered
the horse in sacrifice and assumed the imperial title.
