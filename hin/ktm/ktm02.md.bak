# Concerning Symbols.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

OUR daily life creates our symbol of God. No two ever cover quite the
same conception.

It is so with that symbolism which we know as language. The simple daily
needs of mankind, seem, the world over, to be one. We look, therefore,
for words that correspond in every land.

Yet we know how the tongue of each people expresses some one group of
ideas with especial clearness, and ignores others altogether. Never do
we find an identical strength and weakness repeated: and always if we go
deep enough, we can discover in the circumstances and habits of a
country, a cause for its specific difference of thought or of
expression.

In the North we speak of a certain hour as "twilight," implying a space
of time between the day and night. In India, the sane moments receive
the name of "time of union," since there is no period of
half-light,--the hours of sun and darkness seeming to touch each other
in a point.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

The illustration can be carried further. In the word gloaming lies for
us a wealth of associations,--the throbbing of the falling dusk, the
tenderness of home-coming, the last sleepy laughter of children. The
same emotional note is struck in Indian languages by the expression *at
the hour of cowdust*.

How graphic is the difference! Yonder, beyond the grass, the cow-girl
leads her cattle home to the village for the night. Their feet as they
go strike the dust from the sun-baked path into a cloud behind them. The
herd-girl herself looms large across the pasture--all things grow
quickly dim, as if the air were filled with rising dust.

That word *cowdust*, indeed, strikes a whole vein of expression peculiar
to this Eastern land. Everything about the cow has been observed and
loved and named. As much water as will lie in the hole once made by its
hoof is a well known measure amongst the Aryan folk!

It is unnecessary to argue further

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

that while the facts of nature determine the main developments of
speech, yet every language and group of languages differs from every
other as the characters of individuals and of nations.

 

Something of the same sort is true of religious symbols. Short of
perfect realization, we must see the Eternal Light through a mask
imposed by our own thought. To no two of us, probably, is the mask quite
in the same place, and some reach, by their own growth, diverging points
so distant from the common centre that they mark the extreme limits
hitherto achieved of those great areas known as the Christian, or the
Buddhist, or the this-that-or-the-other consciousness.

To do this, or even to carry a whole race to a new rallying-place round
a standard planted on the old frontier is the peculiar mission of
religious genius.

So Jesus swept down in His might on the old Jewish entrenchments of
justice--righteousness

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

and carried the banner off bodily to that outpost of love and mercy
which struggling souls had reached, indeed, before Him, but which none
had yet been strong enough to make the very heart and focus of vitality.

And so every one of us, simply by thinking his own thought, and living
his own life to the full, may be answering his brother's cry for God in
ways beyond the dreaming of the world. Are Catholic possibilities not
richer for the life of Manning, or Protestant for Frances Ridley
Havergal?

These things being true, the imagery of all men has its significance for
us. The mask is created by our own thought directly, and indirectly
through the reaction of custom upon thought. Like all veils, it brings
at once vision and

the limiting of vision. Only by realising the full sense of every symbol
can we know the whole thought of Humanity about God.

 

But down with all masks!

The Uncreated Flame itself we

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

long for, without symbol or veil or barrier. If we cannot see God and
live,--let us then die--what is there to fear? Consume us in primal
fire, dissolve us into living ocean, but interpose nothing, no, nor the
shadow of anything, between the soul and the divine draught for which it
thirsts!

 

True. Yet for each of us there is a chosen way. We ourselves may still
be seeking it, where and when still hidden from our eyes. But deep in
our hearts is rooted the assurance that the moment will yet come, the
secret signal be exchanged, the mystic name will fall upon our ears, and
somewhere, somewhen, somehow, our feet shall pass within the gates of
Peace, we shall enter on the road that ends only with the Beatific
Vision.

Till then, well says the old Hindu poet of the folk-song to himself:--

"Tulsi, coming into this world,  
Seek thou to live with all  
For who knows where or in what guise,  
The Lord Himself may come to thee?"

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

Our daily life creates our symbol of God.

To the Arab of the desert, with his patriarchal customs, the father of
the family,--just and calm in his judgments, protector of his kindred,
loving to those who played about his knees as babes,--may well stand as
the type of all in which men feel security.

Naturally, then, it was the Semitic mind that flashed across the dim
communing of the soul with the Eternal, the rapturous illumination of
the great word "Father."

God our father,--bound even to the most erring of His children by a
kinship that misdoing cannot break (for if the human tie be
indissoluble, shall the divine be less so?); father,--by a tie so
intimate that to this day the stalwart Afghan, prostrating in the
mosque, says "Thee" and "Thou" to the God of Hosts, as might an infant
on its father's knee!

In the Aryan home, woman stands supreme. As wife in the West,--lady and
queen of her husband--as mother in the East,--a goddess

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

throned in her son's worship,--she is the bringer of sanctity and peace.

Profound depths stir within us, in presence of the intensely Christian
conception of God--a child in His mother's arms. This ideal of the heart
of a woman--pierced by its seven sorrows, on fire with love, mother
beside the cradle, worshipper beneath the cross, and glorified in great
humility,--has been one of the richest gifts of the Catholic Church to
humanity.

Peerless in its own way is the womanhood of Rossetti's sonnet:--

"This is that blessed Mary, pre-elect  
God's Virgin. Gone is a great while, and she  
Dwelt young in Nazareth of Galilee . .  
Unto God's will she brought devout respect,--  
Profound simplicity of intellect,  
And supreme patience . . . . . .  
Thus held she through her girlhood,  
As it were an angel-watered lily,  
That near God grows, and is quiet."

 

Jesus Himself--to those who kneel before no Madonna in the
Vatican--sounds this note of the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

eternal feminine. "Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy
laden, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me,
for I am meek and lowly of heart, and ye shall find rest unto your
souls." Is it not a woman's cry?

Nay, He is conscious of this element in His own nature. Once at least He
speaks of it. In that sublime moment when He, the young Leader of the
armies of the future, stands on the sunlit mountains, and looking down
upon the city of His race sees the dark shadow of destiny wrapping it
about, in that moment when the Patriot forgets, in a sob of human
anguish, that He is Master and Redeemer, in that moment He becomes all
motherhood. "O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Thou that killest the prophets, and
stonest them that are sent unto thee,--how often would I have gathered
thy children together, like as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, and ye would not!"

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

The soul that worships becomes always a little child: the soul that
becomes a child finds God oftenest as mother. In a meditation before the
Blessed Sacrament, some pen has written the exquisite assurance: "My
child, you need not know much in order to please Me. Only love Me
dearly. Speak to me, as you would talk to your mother, if she had taken
you in her arms."

But it is in India that this thought of the mother has been realised in
its completeness. In that country where the image of Kali is one of the
most popular symbols of deity, it is quite customary to speak of God, as
"She," and the direct address then offered is simply "Mother."

But under what strange guise! In the West, art and poetry have been
exhausted to associate all that is tender and precious with this thought
of woman-worship. The mother plays with the little One, or caresses or
nurses Him. Sometimes she even makes her arm a throne, whereon He sits
to bless the world.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

In the East, the accepted symbol is of a woman nude, with flowing hair,
so dark a blue that she seems in colour to be black, four-handed---two
hands in the act of blessing, and two holding a knife and bleeding head
respectively,--garlanded with skulls, and dancing, with protruding
tongue, on the prostrate figure of a man all white with ashes.

A terrible, an extraordinary figure! Those who call it horrible may well
be forgiven. They pass only through the outer court of the temple. They
are not arrived where the Mother's voice can reach them. This, in its
own way is well.

Vet, this image, so fearful to the Western mind, is perhaps dearer than
any other to the heart of India. It is not, indeed, the only form in
which the Divine Energy presents Herself to Her worshippers. To the
Sikh, She is absorbed, embodied in his sword; all women, especially as
children, are Her incarnations; glorious Sita carries the great reality
to many.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

But Kali comes closer to us than these. Others we admire; others we
love; to Her we belong. Whether we know it or not, we are Her children,
playing round Her knees. Life is but a game of hide-and-seek with Her,
and if, in its course, we chance to touch Her feet, who can measure the
shock of the divine energy that enters into us? Who can utter the
rapture of our cry of "Mother?"
