# Kali the Mother.

The stars are blotted out,  
Clouds are covering clouds,  
It is darkness, vibrant, sonant.  
In the roaring whirling wind  
Are the souls of a million lunatics,--  
But loosed from the prison house,--  
Wrenching trees by the roots,  
Sweeping all from the path.  
The sea has joined the fray,  
And swirls up mountain-waves,  
To reach the pitchy sky.  
     Scattering plagues and sorrows,  
     Dancing mad with joy,  
     Come, Mother, Come!

For Terror is thy name,  
Death is in Thy breath.  
And every shaking step  
Destroys a world for e’er.  
Thou "Time" the All-Destroyer  
     Then come, O Mother, Come!

Who can misery love,  
Dance in destruction's dance,  
And hug the form of Death,  
     To him the Mother comes.  
                                      V.
