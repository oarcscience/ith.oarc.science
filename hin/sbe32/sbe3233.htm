<p>1. The Maruts charged with rain <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:1">1</A>, endowed with fierce force, terrible like wild beasts <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:2">2</A>, blazing <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:3">3</A> in their strength <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:4">4</A>, brilliant like fires, and impetuous <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:5">5</A>, have uncovered the (rain-giving) cows by blowing away the cloud <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:6">6</A>.</p>  
<p>2. The (Maruts) with their rings <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:2:1">1</A> appeared like the heavens with their stars <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:2:2">2</A>, they shone wide like streams from clouds as soon as Rudra, the strong man, was born for you, O golden-breasted Maruts, in the bright lap of P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:2:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>3. They wash <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:1">1</A> their horses like racers in the courses, they hasten with the points of the reed <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:2">2</A> on their quick steeds. O golden jawed <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:3">3</A> Maruts, violently shaking (your jaws), you go quick <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:4">4</A> with your spotted deer <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:5">5</A>, being friends of one mind.</p>  
<p>4. Those Maruts have grown to feed <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:4:1">1</A> all these beings, or, it may be, (they have come) hither for the sake of a friend, they who always bring quickening rain. They have spotted horses, their bounties cannot be taken away, they are like headlong charioteers on their ways <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:4:2">2</A>.</p>  
<p>5. O Maruts, wielding your brilliant spears, come hither on smooth <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:5:1">1</A> roads with your fiery <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:5:2">2</A> cows (clouds) whose udders are swelling; (come hither), being of one mind, like swans toward their nests, to enjoy the sweet offering.</p>  
<p>6. O one-minded Maruts, come to our prayers, come to our libations like (Indra) praised by men <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:6:1">1</A>!</p>  
<p><a name="page_296"><font size="1" color="green">p. 296</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Fulfil (our prayer) like the udder of a barren cow <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:6:2">2</A>, and make the prayer glorious by booty to the singer.</p>  
<p>7. Grant us this strong horse for our chariot, a draught <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:7:1">1</A> that rouses our prayers, from day to day, food to the singers, and to the poet in our homesteads <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:7:2">2</A> luck <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:7:3">3</A>, wisdom, inviolable and invincible strength.</p>  
<p>8. When the gold-breasted Maruts harness the horses to their chariots, bounteous <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:8:1">1</A> in wealth, then it is as if a cow in the folds poured out <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:8:2">2</A> to her calf copious food, to every man who has offered libations.</p>  
<p>9. Whatever mortal enemy may have placed us among wolves <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:9:1">1</A>, shield us from hurt, ye Vasus! Turn the wheels with burning heat<A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:9:2">2</A> against him, and strike down the weapon of the impious fiend, O Rudras!</p>  
<p>10. Your march, O Maruts, appears brilliant, whether even friends have milked the udder of P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni, or whether, O sons of Rudra, you mean to blame him who praises you, and to weaken those who are weakening Trita, O unbeguiled heroes <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:10:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>11. We invoke you, the great Maruts, the constant wanderers, at the offering of the rapid Vish<I>n</I>u <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:11:1">1</A>; holding ladles (full of libations) and prayerful we ask the golden-coloured and exalted Maruts for glorious wealth.</p>  
<p>12. The Da<I>s</I>agvas (Maruts?) <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:12:1">1</A> carried on <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:12:2">2</A> the sacrifice first; may they rouse us at the break of dawn. Like the dawn, they uncover the dark nights with the red (rays), the strong ones, with their brilliant light, as with a sea of milk.</p>  
<p>13. With the (morning) clouds, as if with glittering red ornaments <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:13:1">1</A>, these Maruts have grown great in the sacred places <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:13:2">2</A>. Streaming down with rushing</p>  
<p><a name="page_297"><font size="1" color="green">p. 297</font></A></p>  
<p>splendour <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:13:3">3</A>, they have assumed their bright and brilliant colour.</p>  
<p>14. Approaching <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:14:1">1</A> them for their great protection to help us, we invoke them with this worship, they whom Trita may bring near, like the five Hot<I>ri</I> priests for victory <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:14:2">2</A>, descending on their chariot to help.</p>  
<p>15. May that grace of yours by which you help the wretched <A HREF="sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:15:1">1</A> across all anguish, and by which you deliver the worshipper from the reviler, come hither, O Maruts; may your favour approach us like a cow (going to her calf)!</p>

<p>Hymn ascribed to G<I>ri</I>tsamada. Metre, 1-14 Gagat&icirc;, 15 Trish<I>t</I>ubh, according to the paribh&acirc;sh&acirc; in the Sarv&acirc;nukrama<I>n</I>&icirc; 12, 13. See also Ludwig, III, p. 59; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l&#8217;histoire de la liturgie v&eacute;dique, 1889, pp. 66 seq.; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, p. 144. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV. The first verse is found in TB. II, 5, 5, 4, with three various readings, viz. tavish&eacute;bhir &ucirc;rm&iacute;bhi<I>h</I> instead of t&aacute;vish&icirc;bhir ar<I>k</I>&iacute;na<I>h</I>, bhr&uacute;mim instead of bh<I>r&iacute;</I>mim, and r&iacute;pa instead of &aacute;pa.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:1:1">1</A>. Dh&acirc;r&acirc;var&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, a word of doubtful import, possibly meaning wishing for rain, or the suitors of the streams of rain. The Maruts are sometimes represented as varas or suitors; cf. V, 60, 4.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:1:2">2</A>. Cf. II, 33, 11.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:1:3">3</A>. Bergaigne, II, 381, translates ar<I>k</I>&iacute;na<I>h</I> by chantres, singers, deriving it, as it would seem, from arka which, as he maintains (Journ. Asiat. 1884, IV, pp. 194 seq.), means always song in the RV. (Rel. V&eacute;d. I, 279). This, however, is not the case, as has been well shown by Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, pp. 23 seq. Besides, unless we change ar<I>k</I>ina<I>h</I> into arki<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>, we must connect it with ar<I>k</I>i, light. Thus we read VIII, 41, 8, ar<I>k</I>&iacute;n&acirc; pad&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:1:4">4</A>. Tavish&eacute;bhir &ucirc;rm&iacute;bhi<I>h</I>, the reading of the Taittir&icirc;yas, is explained by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a by balavadbhir gamanai<I>h</I>. It may have been taken from RV. VI, 61, 2.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:1:5">5</A>. On ri<I>g</I>&icirc;sh&iacute;n, see I, 64, 12<sup>5</sup>; I, 87, I.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:1:6">6</A>. Bh<I>r&iacute;</I>mi seems to me a name of the cloud, driven about by the wind. The Taittir&icirc;yas read bhr&uacute;mim, and S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains it by megha<I>m</I> dharnanta<I>s</I> <I>k</I>&acirc;layanta<I>h</I>. In most passages, no doubt, bh<I>ri</I>mi means quick, fresh, and is opposed to radhra, IV, 32, 2; VII, 56, 20. In I, 31, 16, as applied to Agni, it may mean quick. But in our passage that meaning is impossible, and I prefer the traditional</p>  
<p><a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="green">p. 299</font></A></p>  
<p>meaning of cloud to that of storm-wind, adopted by Benfey and Roth. The expression 'to blow a storm-wind' is not usual, while dham is used in the sense of blowing away clouds and darkness. The cows would then be the waters in the clouds. It is possible, however, that S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's explanation, according to which bh<I>ri</I>mi is a musical instrument, may rest on some traditional authority. In this case it would correspond to dh&aacute;manta<I>h</I> v&acirc;<I>n</I>&aacute;m, in I, 85, 10<sup>2</sup>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:2:1">1</A>. On kh&acirc;din, see I, 166, 9, note 2. On rukma-vakshas, I, 64, 4, note 1. Golden-breasted is meant for armed with golden chest-plates. The meaning seems to be that the Maruts with their brilliant kh&acirc;dis appear like the heavens with their brilliant stars. The Maruts are not themselves lightning and rain, but they are seen in them, as Agni is not the fire, but present in the fire, or the god of fire. Thus we read, RV. III, 26, 6. agn&eacute;<I>h</I> bh&acirc;&acute;mam mar&uacute;t&acirc;m &oacute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I>, 'The splendour of Agni, the strength of the Maruts,' i.&nbsp;e. the lightning. It must be admitted, however, that a conjecture, proposed by Bollensen (Z.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G. XLI, p. 501), would improve the verse. He proposes to read <I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>aya<I>h</I> instead of v<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>aya<I>h</I>. We should then have to translate, 'Their spears shone like lightnings from the clouds.' These <I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>is or spears are mentioned by the side of kh&acirc;di and rukma in RV. V, 54, 11, and the compound <I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>&iacute;vidyuta<I>h</I> is applied to the Maruts in I, 168, 5 and V, 52, 13. The difficulty which remains is abhr&iacute;y&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:2:2">2</A>. On dy&acirc;&acute;vo n&aacute; st<I>ri</I>bhi<I>h</I>, see note to I, 87, 1.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:2:3">3</A>. The second line is full of difficulties. No doubt the Maruts are represented as the sons of Rudra (V, 60, 5; VI, 66, 3), and as the sons of P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni, fem., being called P<I>r&iacute;</I><I>s</I>ni-m&acirc;tara<I>h</I>. Their birth is sometimes spoken of as unknown (VII, 56, 2), but hardly as mysterious. Who knows their birth, hardly means more than 'the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh.' P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni as a feminine is the speckled sky, and the cloud may have been conceived</p>  
<p><a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="green">p. 300</font></A></p>  
<p>as the udder at the same time that P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni was conceived as a cow (I, 160, 3). Nothing seems therefore more natural than that we should translate, 'When Rudra had begotten you in the bright lap of P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni.' The bright lap, <I>s</I>ukr&aacute;m &ucirc;&acute;dha<I>h</I>, is an idiomatic expression (VI, 66, 1; IV, 3, 10), and I see no reason why we should with Roth, K.&nbsp;Z. XXVI, 49, change the <I>s</I>ukr&eacute; of the padap&acirc;<I>th</I>a into <I>s</I>ukr&aacute;<I>h</I> and refer it to v<I>r&iacute;</I>sh&acirc;.</p>  
<p>The real difficulty lies in &aacute;<I>g</I>ani. Can it mean he begot, as Bergaigne (Religion V&eacute;dique, III, 35) interprets it? Wherever &aacute;<I>g</I>ani occurs it means he was born, and I doubt whether it can mean anything else. It is easy to suggest a<I>g</I>an&icirc;t, for though the third person of the aorist never occurs in the RV., the other persons, such as a<I>g</I>anish<I>t</I>a, <I>g</I>anish<I>th</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>, are there. But, as the verse now stands, we must translate, 'When Rudra was born for you, he the strong one in the bright udder of P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni.' Could Rudra be here conceived as the son, he who in other passages is represented as the husband of P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni? There is another passage which may yield the same sense, VI, 66, 3. vid&eacute; h&iacute; m&acirc;t&acirc;&acute; mah&aacute;<I>h</I> mah&icirc;&acute; s&acirc;&acute;, s&acirc;&acute; &iacute;t p<I>r&iacute;</I><I>s</I>ni<I>h</I> subhve&#771; g&aacute;rbham &acirc;&acute; adh&acirc;t, 'for she, the great, is known as the mother of the great, that very P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni conceived the germ (the Maruts) for the strong one.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:3:1">1</A>. Uksh&aacute;nte is explained by washing, cleaning the horses, before they start for a new race. See V, 59, I. uksh&aacute;nte &aacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc;n, followed by t&aacute;rushante &acirc;&acute; r&aacute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I>; IX, 109, 10. &aacute;<I>s</I>va<I>h</I> n&aacute; nikt&aacute;<I>h</I> v&acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;&acute; dh&aacute;n&acirc;ya; <I>S</I>atap. Br. XI, 5, 5, 13. Pischel (Ved. Stud. I, 189) supposes that it always refers to the washing after a race.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:3:2">2</A>. Nad&aacute;sya k&aacute;r<I>n</I>ai<I>h</I> is very difficult. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's explanation, meghasya madhyaprade<I>s</I>ai<I>h</I>, 'through the hollows of the cloud,' presupposes that nada by itself can in the RV. be used in the sense of cloud, and that kar<I>n</I>a, ear, may have the meaning of a hole or a passage. To take, as BR. propose, k&aacute;r<I>n</I>a in the sense of kar<I>n</I>&aacute;, eared, with long ears, would not help us much. Grassmann's</p>  
<p><a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="green">p. 301</font></A></p>  
<p>translation, 'mit der Wolke schnellen Fittigen,' is based on a conjectural reading, nadasya par<I>n</I>ai<I>h</I>. Ludwig's translation, 'mit des fluszes wellen den raschen eilen sie,' is ingenious, but too bold, for kar<I>n</I>a never means waves, nor nada river in the Rig-veda. The Ved&acirc;rthayatna gives: 'they rush with steeds that make the roar,' taking kar<I>n</I>ai<I>h</I> for kart<I>ri</I>bhi<I>h</I>, which again is simply impossible. The best explanation is that suggested by Pischel, Ved. Stud., p. 189. He takes nada for reed, and points out that whips were made of reeds. The kar<I>n</I>a would be the sharp point of the reed, most useful for a whip. I cannot, however, follow him in taking &acirc;<I>s</I>&uacute;bhi<I>h</I> in the sense of accelerating. I think it refers to a<I>s</I>va in the preceding p&acirc;da.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:3:3">3</A>. H&iacute;ra<I>n</I>ya<I>s</I>ipr&acirc;<I>h</I>. <I>S</I>ipr&acirc;, in the dual <I>s</I>ipre, is intended for the jaws, the upper and lower jaws, as in RV. I, 101, 10. v&iacute; syasva <I>s</I>&iacute;pre, open the jaws. See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 249, note. RV. III, 32, I; V, 36, 2, <I>s</I>ipre and h&aacute;n&ucirc;; VIII, 76, 10); X, 96, 9. <I>s</I>&iacute;pre h&aacute;ri<I>n</I>&icirc; d&aacute;vidhvata<I>h</I>; X, 105, 5. <I>s</I>&iacute;pr&acirc;bhy&acirc;m <I>s</I>ipr&iacute;<I>n</I>&icirc;v&acirc;n. In the plural, however, <I>s</I>ipr&acirc;<I>h</I>, V, 54, 11 (<I>s</I>&iacute;pr&acirc;<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&icirc;rsh&aacute;su v&iacute;tat&acirc;<I>h</I> hira<I>n</I>y&aacute;y&icirc;<I>h</I>), VIII, 7, 25, is intended for something worn on the head, made of gold or gold threads. As we speak of the ears of a cap, that is, lappets which protect the ears, or of the cheeks of a machine, so in this case the jaws seem to have been intended for what protects the jaws, and not necessarily for the real jaw-bones of an animal; used as an helmet, and afterwards imitated in any kind of metal. As to <I>s</I>iprin it may mean helmeted or possessed of jaws. To be possessed of jaws is no peculiar distinction, yet in several of the passages where <I>s</I>iprin occurs, there is a clear reference to eating and drinking; see VI, 44, 14; VIII, 2, 28; 17, 4; 32, 24; 33, 7; 92, 4; see also <I>s</I>&iacute;prav&acirc;n in VI, 17, 2. It is possible therefore that like su<I>s</I>ipra, <I>s</I>iprin also was used in the sense of possessed of jaw-bones, i.&nbsp;e. of strong jaw-bones. Even such epithets as h&iacute;ra<I>n</I>ya-<I>s</I>ipra, h&aacute;ri-<I>s</I>ipra, h&iacute;ri-<I>s</I>ipra may mean possessed of golden, possibly of strong jaws. (M.&nbsp;M., Biographies of Words, p. 263, note.) Roth takes h&aacute;ri<I>s</I>ipra as yellow-jawed, h&iacute;ri<I>s</I>ipra as golden-cheeked, or with golden helmet, hira<I>n</I>ya<I>s</I>ipra, with golden</p>  
<p><a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="green">p. 302</font></A></p>  
<p>helmet. A decision between golden-jawed or golden-helmeted is difficult, yet golden-jawed is applicable in all cases.</p>  
<p>In our passage we must be guided by d&aacute;vidhvata<I>h</I>, which together with <I>s</I>&iacute;pra occurs again X, 96, 9. <I>s</I>&iacute;pre v&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>&acirc;ya h&aacute;ri<I>n</I>i d&aacute;vidhvata<I>h</I>, shaking the golden jaws, and it seems best to translate: O ye golden-jawed Maruts, shaking (your jaws), you go to feed.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:3:4">4</A>. If we retain the accent in p<I>ri</I>ksh&aacute;m, we shall have to take it as an adverb, from p<I>ri</I>ksh&aacute;, quick, vigorous, like the German sn&euml;l. This view is supported by Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, 96. If, however, we could change the accent into p<I>r&iacute;</I>ksham, we might defend S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's interpretation. We should have to take p<I>r&iacute;</I>ksham as the accusative of p<I>ri</I>ksh, corresponding to the dative p<I>ri</I>ksh&eacute; in the next verse. P<I>ri</I>ksh is used together with <I>s</I>ubh, ish, &ucirc;r<I>g</I> (VI, 62, 4), and as we have <I>s</I>ubham y&acirc;, we might take p<I>r&iacute;</I>ksham y&acirc; in the sense of going for food, in search of food. But it is better to take p<I>ri</I>ksh&aacute;m as an adverb. In the next verse p<I>ri</I>ksh&eacute; is really a kind of infinitive, governing bh&ucirc;van&acirc;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:3:5">5</A>. Tradition explains the P<I>ri</I>shat&icirc;s as spotted deer, but p<I>ri</I>shada<I>s</I>va, as an epithet of the Maruts, need not mean having P<I>ri</I>shat&icirc;s for their horses, but having spotted horses. See Bergaigne, Rel. V&eacute;d. II, p. 378, note.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>

Bergaigne, I, p. 305, doubts whether Nar&acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa can be a proper name in our passage, but on p. 308 he calls it an appellation of Indra.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:6:2">2</A>. &Aacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc;m iva, gives a sense, but one quite inappropriate to the Veda. It would mean, 'fill the cow in her udder like a mare.' I therefore propose to read asva&#771;m iva (asuam iva), from as&ucirc;, a cow that is barren, or a cow that has not yet calved. Thus we read, I, 112, 3. y&acirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I> dhen&uacute;m asva&#771;m p&iacute;nvatha<I>h</I>, 'with the same help with which you nourish a barren cow.' Cf. I, 116, 22. starya&#771;m pipyathu<I>h</I> g&acirc;&acute;m, 'you have filled the barren cow.' If asva&#771;m iva dhen&uacute;m is a simile, we want an object to which it refers, and this we find in dh&iacute;yam. Thus we read, V, 71, 2; VII, 94, 2; IX, 19, 2, pipyatam dh&iacute;ya<I>h</I>, to fulfil prayers. I know, of course, that such changes in the sacred text will for the present seem most objectionable to my friends in India, but I doubt not that the time will come when they will see that such emendations are inevitable. I see that in the appendix to the Petersburg Dictionary, s.&nbsp;v. as&ucirc;, the same conjecture has been suggested.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:7:1">1</A>. Here again I have taken great liberties. &Acirc;p&acirc;n&aacute;m is explained by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a as a participle for &acirc;pnuvantam. This participle, though quite correct (see Lindner, Altindische Nominalbildung, p. 54), does not occur again in the RV., nor does it yield a proper meaning. It could only mean, 'give us a horse to the chariot, an obtaining prayer, rousing the attention (of the gods) day by day.' &Acirc;p&acirc;na may mean a drinking or carousing, and I do not see why we should not take it in that sense. Sacrifices in ancient times' were often festivals; VII, 22, 3. im&acirc;&acute; br&aacute;hma sadham&acirc;&acute;de <I>g</I>ushasva, 'accept these prayers at our feast.' If we suppose that &acirc;p&acirc;na refers to the drinking of Soma, then</p>  
<p><a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="green">p. 304</font></A></p>  
<p>nothing is more appropriate than to call the drinking <I>k</I>it&aacute;yat, exciting, br&aacute;hma, a hymn. Anyhow I can discover no better meaning in this line. Grassmann, who knows that <I>k</I>itayati means to excite, yet translates: 'Gebt Gebet, das durchdringt, euch erinnernd Tag f&uuml;r Tag.' Ludwig: 'Das erfolgreiche brahma, das erinnernde tag f&uuml;r tag.' Possibly we should have to change the accent from &acirc;p&acirc;n&aacute; to &acirc;p&acirc;&acute;na. &Acirc;p&acirc;n&aacute; in IX, 10, 5 is equally obscure.</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:10:1">1</A>. The second line is obscure. Neither Grassmann nor Ludwig nor S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a can extract any intelligible meaning from it. I have translated it, but I am far from satisfied. There may be an antithesis between the friends (the Maruts themselves, see V, 53, 2), milking the udder of P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni, and the Maruts coming to blame their friends for not offering them sacrifices, or for offering them sacrifices in common with Indra. In the first case when they, as friends, milk the cloud, their approach is brilliant and auspicious. In the second case, when they come to blame those who ought to celebrate them, or those who are actually hostile to them by causing the ruin or decay of a friend of the Maruts, such as Trita, their approach is likewise brilliant, but not auspicious. Trita is a friend of the Maruts whom they assist in battle, and it is possible that this legend may be alluded to here. Sometimes Trita seems also connected with the third libation which was offered at sunset, just as Vish<I>n</I>u represented the second libation which was offered at noon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>. Thus we read, VIII, 12, 16. y&aacute;t s&oacute;mam indra v&iacute;sh<I>n</I>avi y&aacute;t v&acirc; gha trit&eacute; &acirc;pty&eacute; y&aacute;t v&acirc; mar&uacute;tsu m&aacute;ndase, 'whether you, Indra, enjoy the Soma near Vish<I>n</I>u, or near Trita &Acirc;ptya, or among the Maruts.' <I>S</I>&acirc;kap&ucirc;<I>n</I>i, as quoted by Y&acirc;ska (Nir. XII, 19), explains the three steps of Vish<I>n</I>u as earth, sky, and heaven; Aur<I>n</I>av&acirc;bha distinguishes Sam&acirc;roha<I>n</I>a, Vish<I>n</I>upada, and Gaya<I>s</I>iras. But all this does not help us to disentangle our verse. It should be added that Bergaigne makes Trit&aacute;m to be governed by duh&ucirc;<I>h</I> (Rel. V&eacute;d. II, 327). We should then have to translate, 'or whether they milk Trita in order to blame the singer, to make them old who make</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="green">p. 306</font></A></p>  
<p>others old, or who themselves become old.' This, however, does not help us much. Professor Oldenberg conjectures that possibly <I>g</I>urat&acirc;&acute;m might be changed to <I>g</I>ur&aacute;t&acirc;&acute;m, and that the dual of the verb might refer to Rudra and P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni; or we might read <I>g</I>ur&aacute;t&acirc; for <I>g</I>ur&aacute;ta, if it refers to Rudriyas. N&aacute;vam&acirc;nasya might also be used in the sense of making a noise (see I, 29, 5), and possibly n&aacute;vam&acirc;nasya nid&eacute; might have been intended for shouting and laughing to scorn. But all this leaves the true meaning of the verse as unfathomable as ever.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:11:1">1</A>. V&iacute;sh<I>n</I>or esh&aacute;sya prabh<I>ri</I>th&eacute; is obscure. At the offering of the rapid Vish<I>n</I>u is supposed to mean, when the rapid Vish<I>n</I>u offers Soma. The same phrase occurs again, VII, 40, 5. In VIII, 20, 3, we can translate, 'we know the strength of the Maruts, and of the hasting Vish<I>n</I>u, the bounteous gods.' In VII, 39, 5, the reading is v&iacute;sh<I>n</I>um esh&acirc;m. Bergaigne (II, 419) is inclined to take vish<I>n</I>u esha as Soma. We should then translate, 'at the offering of Soma.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 12.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:12:1">1</A>. The Da<I>s</I>agvas are mentioned as an old priestly family, like the A&#7749;giras, and they seem also, like the A&#7749;giras, to have their prototypes or their ancestors among the divine hosts. Could they here be identified with the Maruts? They are said to have been the first to carry on the sacrifice, and they are asked to rouse men at the break of the day. Now the same may be said of the Maruts. They are often connected with the dawn, probably because the storms break forth with greater vigour in the morning, or, it may be, because the chasing away of the darkness of the night recalls the struggle between the darkness of the thunderstorm and the brightness of the sun. The matutinal character of the Maruts appears, for instance, in V, 53, 14 (usr&iacute; bhesha<I>g</I>&aacute;m), and their father Dyaus is likewise called v<I>ri</I>shabh&aacute;<I>h</I> usr&iacute;ya<I>h</I>, V, 58, 6. In the second line &ucirc;r<I>n</I>ute, though in the singular, refers also to the Maruts in the plural; see Bergaigne, M&eacute;langes Renier,</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Paris, 1886, p. 80. There still remain two difficult words, man&aacute;<I>h</I> and g&oacute;-ar<I>n</I>as&acirc;. The former (see Lanman, p. 501) may be taken as an adjective referring to the Da<I>s</I>agvas or Maruts, unless we take it as an adverb, quickly, like makshu. If we could change it into mah&acirc;&acute;, it would form an appropriate adjective to <I>g</I>yotish&acirc;, as in IV, 50, 4. On g&oacute;-ar<I>n</I>as&acirc; all that can be said is that it mostly occurs where something is uncovered or revealed, so I, 112, 18; X, 38, 2.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:12:2">2</A>. On ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>am vah, to carry on the sacrifice like a wagon, see Bergaigne, Rel. V&eacute;d. II, 259-260. See also RV. VIII, 26, 15; 58, 1, and ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a-v&acirc;has.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 13.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:13:1">1</A>. In interpreting this obscure verse we must begin with what is clear. The aru<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&aacute;ya<I>h</I> are the well-known ornaments of the Maruts, mentioned I, 37, 2, note; I, 64, 4, note, &amp;c. The Maruts shine in these ornaments or paints, I, 85, 3; 87, 1; V, 56, 1; X, 78, 7. Though we do not know their special character, we know that, like the daggers, spears, and bracelets of the Maruts, they were supposed to contribute to their beautiful appearance. Again, we know that when the Maruts are said to grow (vav<I>ri</I>dhu<I>h</I>), that means that they grow in strength, in spirits, and in splendour, or, in a physical sense, that the storms increase, that the thunder roars, and the lightnings flash, see V, 55, 3; 59, 5. Now if it is said that the Rudras grew with ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;s, as if with bright red ornaments, we must have in these ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;s the physical prototype of what are metaphorically called their glittering ornaments. And here we can only think either of the bright morning clouds (referring to ush&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> n&aacute; r&acirc;m&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> aru<I>n</I>a&iacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;pa &ucirc;r<I>n</I>ute in the preceding verse), or lightnings. These bright clouds of heaven are sometimes conceived as the mothers (III, 9, 2. ap&aacute;<I>h</I> m&acirc;t<I>r&icirc;&acute;</I><I>h</I>), and more especially the mothers of the Maruts, who are in consequence called S&iacute;ndhu-m&acirc;tara<I>h</I>, X, 78, 6, a name elsewhere given to Soma, IX, 61, 7, and to the A<I>s</I>vins, I, 46, 2. It is said of a well-known hero, Pur&ucirc;ravas (originally a solar hero), that as soon as he was born the women (gn&acirc;<I>h</I>) were there, and immediately afterwards</p>  
<p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="green">p. 308</font></A></p>  
<p>that the rivers increased or cherished him, X, 95, 7. In other passages too these celestial rivers or waters or clouds are represented as women, whether mothers or wives (X, 124, 7). A number of names are given to these beings, when introduced as the companions of the Apsaras Urva<I>s</I>&icirc;, and it is said of them that they carne along like a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&aacute;ya<I>h</I> aru<I>n</I>&aacute;ya<I>h</I>, like bright red ornaments, X, 95, 6. It seems clear therefore that the aru<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&aacute;ya<I>h</I> of the Maruts have to be explained by the bright red clouds of the morning, or in more mythological language, by the Apsaras, who are said to be like aru<I>n</I>&aacute;ya<I>h</I> a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&aacute;ya<I>h</I>. Hence, whatever its etymology may have been, ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I> in our passage must refer to the clouds of heaven, and the verse can only be translated, 'the Rudras grew with the clouds as with their red ornaments,' that is, the clouds were their red ornaments, and as the clouds grew in splendour, the Maruts grew with their splendid ornaments.</p>  
<p>Professor Geldner arrived at a similar conclusion. In Bezzenberger's Beitr&auml;ge, XI, p. 327, and more recently in Ved. Stud., p. 277, he assigned to ksho<I>n</I>&icirc; the meaning of woman, which is quite possible, and would make it a synonym of the celestial gn&acirc;s. But he translates, 'the Maruts excite themselves with red colours as with women.' These are hardly Vedic thoughts, and the position of n&aacute; would remain anomalous. Nor should we gain much if we read to ksho<I>n</I>aya<I>h</I> aru<I>n</I>ebhi<I>h</I> na a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ibhi<I>h</I>, 'these Rudras were delighted like wives by bright ornaments.' The bright ornaments have once for all a settled meaning, they are peculiar to the Maruts, and cannot in a Marut hymn be taken in any other sense.</p>  
<p>Then comes the question, how is the meaning assigned to ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;, namely cloud, or, as personified, Apsaras, applicable to other passages? In X, 95, 9, it seems most appropriate: 'So long as the mortal (Pur&ucirc;ravas), longing for the immortal (Apsaras), does not come near with strength to those ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;s, i.&nbsp;e. those Apsaras, or morning clouds, they beautified their bodies like ducks' (an excellent image, if one watches ducks cleaning themselves in the water), 'like sporting horses biting each other.' Geldner</p>  
<p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></A></p>  
<p>translates this verse somewhat differently, Ved. Stud. I, p. 276.</p>  
<p>Having disposed of these two passages where ksho<I>n</I>&icirc; occurs in the plural, we have next to consider those where it stands in the dual. Here ksho<I>n</I>&icirc; always means heaven and earth, like rodas&icirc;, dy&acirc;v&acirc;p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>VIII, 7, 22. s&aacute;m u ty&eacute; mahat&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> ap&aacute;<I>h</I> s&aacute;m ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute; s&aacute;m u s&ucirc;&acute;ryam &#8230; parva<I>s</I>&aacute;<I>h</I> dadhu<I>h</I>. They, the Maruts, set the great waters (the sky), heaven and earth and the sun piecemeal (or, they put them together piece by piece).</p>  
<p>VIII, 52, 10. s&aacute;m &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> r&acirc;&acute;ya<I>h</I> b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> adh&ucirc;nuta s&aacute;m ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute; s&aacute;m u s&ucirc;&acute;ryam. Indra shook the great treasures, heaven and earth, and the sun.</p>  
<p>VIII, 99, 6. &aacute;nu te <I>s</I>&uacute;shmam tur&aacute;yantam &icirc;yatu<I>h</I> ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute; <I>s</I>&iacute;<I>s</I>um n&aacute; m&acirc;t&aacute;r&acirc;. Heaven and earth followed thy rapid strength, like mother-cows their calf.</p>  
<p>II, 16, 3. n&aacute; ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute;bhy&acirc;m paribhve&#771; te indriy&aacute;m. Thy strength is not to be compassed by heaven and earth.</p>  
<p>If after this we look at the passage translated by Professor Geldner, I, 180, 5. ap&aacute;<I>h</I> ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute; sa<I>k</I>ate m&acirc;&acute;hin&acirc; v&acirc;m, we see at once that ap&aacute;<I>h</I> and ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute; cannot be separated, and that we must translate, your M&acirc;hin&acirc; reaches heaven and earth and the sky. M&acirc;hin&acirc;, according to Professor Geldner, means the magnificent woman, namely S&ucirc;ry&acirc;, but it is possible that it may have been meant for 'mahim&acirc;, your greatness reaches heaven and earth and the sky.' Ap&aacute;<I>h</I>, which Professor Geldner translates 'from the water,' is the acc. plural, meaning the waters between heaven and earth, or the sky. It occurs again in connection with heaven and earth, the sun, heaven, and generally without any copula. Thus, VIII, 7, 22. ap&aacute;<I>h</I>, ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute;, s&ucirc;&acute;ryam, i.&nbsp;e. the waters (the sky), heaven and earth, the sun. I, 36, 8. r&oacute;das&icirc; ap&aacute;<I>h</I>, heaven and earth and the waters; cf. V, 31, 6. Likewise I, 52, 12. ap&aacute;<I>h</I> sva&#771;<I>h</I> paribh&ucirc;&acute;<I>h</I> eshi &acirc;&acute; d&iacute;vam; V, 14, 4. &aacute;vindat g&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> ap&aacute;<I>h</I> sva&#771;<I>h</I>; VI, 47, 14. ap&aacute;<I>h</I> g&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>; cf. VI, 60, 2. VII, 44, 1. dy&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;&acute; ap&aacute;<I>h</I> sva&#771;<I>h</I>, cf. X, 36, 1; IX. 90, 4; 91, 6.</p>  
<p>There remain five passages where ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;<I>h</I> occurs, and where Professor Geldner's conjecture that it means women</p>  
<p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></A></p>  
<p>holds good. In I, 54, 1, it may mean real women, or the women of the clouds. In I, 57, 4; 173, 7; VIII, 3, 10; 13, 17; also in X, 22, 9, women seems the most plausible translation.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:13:2">2</A>. <I>R</I>&iacute;tasya s&aacute;dan&acirc;ni is almost impossible to translate. It may be the places in heaven where the Maruts are supposed to be, or the places where sacrifices are offered to them.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:34:13:3">3</A>. &Aacute;tyena p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>as&acirc; has been explained in different ways. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a renders it by always moving power; Grassmann by 'mit schnell erregtem Schimmer;' Ludwig, 'mit eilender kraft,' though he is no longer satisfied with this meaning, and suggests 'net for catching.' Roth has touched several times on this word. In the Allgemeine Monatsschrift of 1851, p. 87, he suggested for p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>as the meaning of 'impression of a foot or of a carriage, perhaps also reflection.' In his Notes on the Nirukta, p. 78 seq., he is very hard on the Indian commentators who explain the word by strength, but who never go conscientiously through all the passages in which a word occurs. He then still maintained that the word ought to be translated by track.</p>  
<p>It seems, however, that the most appropriate meaning in the passages in which p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>as occurs is splendour, though of course a stream of light may be conceived as a bright train or path. In some the meaning of light seems quite inevitable, for instance, III, 15, I. v&iacute; p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>as&acirc; p<I>ri</I>th&uacute;n&acirc; <I>s</I>&oacute;<I>s</I>uk&acirc;na<I>h</I>.

<p>IX, 68, 3. abhivr&aacute;<I>g</I>an &aacute;kshitam p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; dade. (Soma) approaching assumed imperishable splendour. This splendour of Soma is also mentioned in IX, 109, 21, and the expression that he shakes his splendour (v<I>r&iacute;</I>th&acirc; kar) occurs IX, 76, 1; 88, 5. (Cf. Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, p. 117.)</p>  
<p>In VI, 21, 7. abh&iacute; tv&acirc; p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I> raksh&aacute;sa<I>h</I> v&iacute; tasthe, it would, no doubt, seem preferable to translate, 'the power of the Rakshas came upon thee,' but the ugr&aacute;m p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I>, the fierce light, is not out of place either, while in most of the passages which we have examined, the meaning of power would be entirely out of place.</p>  
<p>In I, 121, 11, heaven and earth seem to be called p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>as&icirc;, the two splendours. Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 87, translates &aacute;tyena p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>as&acirc; by 'durch das stattliche Ross,' namely the Soma, but p&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>as seems to be something that belongs to Soma, not Soma himself.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 14.</h5>
