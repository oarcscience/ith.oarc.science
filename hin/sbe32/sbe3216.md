### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 6.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 11-12.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To Indra and the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. Those who stand around [2](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:1:2) him while he
moves on, harness the bright red (steed) [1](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:1:1);
the lights in heaven shine forth [3](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:1:3).

2\. They harness to the chariot on each side his (Indra's)
[1](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:2:1) two favourite bays, the brown, the bold, who
can carry the hero.

3\. Thou who createst light where there was no light, and form, O men
[1](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:3:1)! where there was no form, hast been born
together with the dawns [2](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:3:2).

4\. Thereupon [1](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:4:1) they (the Maruts), according
to their wont [2](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:4:2), assumed again the form of
new-born babes [3](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:4:3), taking their sacred name.

5\. Thou, O Indra, with the swift Maruts [1](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:5:1),
who break even through the stronghold [2](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:5:2), hast
found even in their hiding-place the bright ones
[3](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:5:3) (days or clouds).

6\. The pious singers [1](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:6:1) (the Maruts) have,
after their own mind [2](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:6:2), shouted towards the
giver of wealth, the great, the glorious (Indra).

7\. Mayest thou [1](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:7:1) (host of the Maruts) be
verily seen [2](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:7:2) coming together with Indra, the
fearless: you are both happy-making, and of equal splendour.

8\. With the beloved hosts of Indra, with the blameless, hasting
[2](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:8:2) (Maruts), the sacrificer
[1](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:8:1) cries aloud.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

9\. From yonder, O traveller (Indra), come hither, or from the light of
heaven [1](sbe3216.htm#an_1:6:9:1); the singers all yearn for it;—

10\. Or we ask Indra for help from here, or from heaven, or from above
the earth, or from the great sky.

##### Verse 1.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: The circumstationed (inhabitants
of the three worlds) associate with (Indra), the mighty (Sun), the
indestructive (fire), the moving (wind), and the lights that shine in
the sky.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Die rothe Sonne schirr’n sie an,
die wandelt um die stehenden, Strahlen strahlen am Himmel auf.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Sie spannen an den hellen, den
roten, den vom feststehenden hinwegwandelnden; heller glanz erstralt am
Himmel.

Note <span id="an_1:6:1:1">1</span>. The poet begins with a somewhat
abrupt description of a sunrise. Indra is taken as the god of the bright
day, whose steed is the sun, and whose companions the Maruts, or the
storm-gods. Arushá, meaning originally red, is used as a proper name of
the horse or of the rising sun, though it occurs more frequently as the
name of the red horses or flames of Agni, the god of fire, and also of
the morning light. In our passage, Arushá, a substantive, meaning the
red of the morning, has taken bradhná as an

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

adjective,—bradhná meaning, as far as can be made out, bright in
general, though, as it is especially applied to the Soma-juice, perhaps
bright-brown or yellow. Names of colour are difficult to translate from
one language into another, for their shades vary, and withdraw
themselves from sharp definition. We shall meet with this difficulty
again and again in the Veda; see RV. X, 20, 9.

As it has actually been doubted whether bradhná arushá can be meant for
the sun, and whether the Vedic poets ever looked upon the sun as a
horse, I may quote Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXIII, 4, where the same verse occurs
and is declared to be addressed to the sun; and *S*atap. Br. XIII, 2, 6,
1, where we read, yu*ñg*anti bradhnam arusha*m* *k*arantam iti, asau vâ
âdityo bradhno<sup>ऽ</sup>rusho<sup>ऽ</sup>mum evâsmâ âditya*m* yunakti
svargasya lokasya samash*t*yai. Ludwig remarks justly that the sun has
been conceived as a chariot also, and that bradhná arushá may have been
thus understood here. Delbrück translates quite boldly: Sie schirren die
rothe Sonne an. See also Tait. Br. III, 7, 7, 4; Tâ*nd*ya Br. XXIII, 3,
5; *S*âṅkh. Br. II, 17, 3; Ludwig, Comm. ii. p. 173. M. Bergaigne (Rél.
Ved. iii. p. 324) remarks very truly: 'Le soleil est tantôt une roue,
tantôt un char, tantôt un cheval, trainant le char, tantôt un héros
monté sur le char et dirigeant les chevaux.'

The following passages will illustrate the principal meaning of arushá,
and justify the translation here adopted.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Arushá, as an Adjective.</span>

Arushá is used as an adjective in the sense of red:

VII, 97, 6. tám *s*agmâ´sa*h* arushâ´sa*h* á*s*vâ*h* b*rí*haspátim
saha-vâ´ha*h* vahanti,—nábha*h* ni rûpám arushám vásânâ*h*.

Powerful red horses, drawing together draw him, B*ri*haspati: horses
clothed in red colour, like the sky.

III, 1, 4. *s*vetám *g*a*gñ*ânám arushám mahi-tvâ´.

Agni, the white, when born; the red, by growth. III, 15, 3.
k*ri*sh*n*â´su agne arushá*h* ví bhâhi.

Shine, O Agni, red among the dark ones.

III, 31, 21; VI, 27, 7.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

VII, 75, 6. práti dyutânâ´m arushâ´sa*h* á*s*vâ*h* *k*itrâ´*h*
ad*ris*ran ushásam váhanta*h*.

The red horses, the beautiful, were seen bringing to us the bright dawn.

V, 43, 12; I, 118, 5; IV, 43, 6; V, 73, 5; I, 36, 9; VII, 3, 3; 16, 3;
X, 45, 7; I, 141, 8.

II, 2, 8. sá*h* idhâná*h* ushása*h* râ´myâ*h* ánu svâ´*h* na dîdet
arushé*n*a bhânúnâ.

He (Agni), lit after the lovely dawns, shone like the sky with his red
splendour.

III, 29, 6; IV, 58, 7; I, 114, 5; V, 59, 5; 12, 2; 12, 6; VI, 8, 1.

VI, 48, 6. *s*yâvâ´su arushá*h* v*rí*shâ.

In the dark (nights) the red hero (Agni). Cf. III, 7, 5.

In one passage v*rí*shan arushá is intended for fire in the shape of
lightning.

X, 89, 9. ní amítreshu vadhám indra túmram v*rí*shan v*rí*shâ*n*am
arushám *s*i*s*îhi.

Whet, O strong Indra, the heavy strong red weapon, against the enemies.

X, 43, 9. út *g*âyatâm para*s*ú*h* *g*yótishâ sahá—ví ro*k*atâm
arushá*h* bhânúnâ *s*ú*k*i*h*.

May the axe (the thunderbolt) appear with the light—may the red one
blaze forth, bright with splendour.

X, 1, 6; VI, 3, 6.

X, 20, 9. k*ri*sh*n*á*h* *s*vetá*h* arushá*h* yâ´ma*h* asya bradhná*h*
ri*g*rá*h* utá *s*ó*n*a*h*.

His (Agni's) path is black, white, red, bright, reddish, and yellow.

Here it is extremely difficult to keep all the colours distinct.

Arushá is frequently applied to Soma, particularly in the 9th Ma*nd*ala.
There we read:

IX, 8, 6. arushá*h* hári*h*. IX, 71, 7. arushá*h* divá*h* kaví*h*
v*rí*shâ. IX, 74, 1. vâ´*g*î´ arushá*h*. IX, 82, 1. arushá*h* v*rí*shâ
hári*h*. IX, 89, 3. hárim arushám.

IX, 111, 1. arushá*h* hári*h*. See also IX, 25, 5; 61, 21.

In IX, 72, 1, arushá seems used as a substantive in the sense of
red-horse.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

Professor Spiegel, in his important review of my translation
(Heidelberger Jahrbücher, 1870, p. 104), points out that aurusha in Zend
means white, so that it would seem as if the original meaning of arusha
had been bright, bright like fire, and thus red.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Arushá, as an Appellative.</span>

Arushá is used as an appellative, and in the following senses:

1\. The one red-horse of the Sun, the two or more red-horses of Agni.

I, 6, 1. yu*ñg*ánti bradhnám arushám.

They yoke the bright red-horse (the Sun).

I, 94, 10. yát áyukthâ*h* arushâ´ róhitâ ráthe.

When thou (Agni) hadst yoked the two red-horses and the two ruddy horses
to the chariot. 1, 146, 2.

II, 10, 2. *s*ruyâ´*h* agní*h*—hávam me—*s*yâvâ´ rátham vahata*h* róhitâ
vâ utá arushâ´.

Mayest thou, Agni, hear my call, whether the two black, or the two
ruddy, or the two red-horses carry you.

Here three kinds of colours are clearly distinguished, and an
intentional difference is made between róhita and arushá. IV, 2, 3.

IV, 6, 9. táva tyé agne haríta*h*—róhitâsa*h*—arushâ´sa*h*
v*rí*sha*n*a*h*.

To thee (Agni) belong these bays, these ruddy, these red-horses, the
stallions.

Here, again, three kinds of horses are distinguished—Haríts, Róhitas,
and Arushás.

VIII, 34, 17. yé *rig*ra*h* vâ´ta-ra*m*hasa*h* arushâ´sa*h*
raghusyáda*h*.

Here arushá may be the subject, and the rest adjectives; but it is also
possible to fake all the words as adjectives, referring them to â*s*ú in
the next verse. The fact that *rig*rá likewise expresses a peculiar red
colour, is no objection, as may be seen from I, 6, I; 94, 10.

VII, 42, 2. yuṅkshvá—haríta*h* rohíta*h* *k*a yé vâ sádman arushâ´*h*.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

Yoke (O Agni) the bays, and the ruddy horses, or the red-horses which
are in thy stable. VII, 16, 2.

2\. The cloud, represented as one of the horses of the Maruts.

I, 85, 5. utá arushásya ví syanti dhâ´râ*h*.

(When you go to the battle, O Maruts), the streams of the red (horse)
flow off.

V, 56, 7. utá syá*h* vâ´*g*î´ arushá*h*.

This strong red-horse,—meant for one of the horses of the Maruts, but,
at the same time, as sending rain.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Arushá, as the Proper Name of a Solar Deity.</span>

Besides the passages in which arushá is used either as an adjective, in
the sense of red, or as an appellative, meaning some kind of horse,
there are others in which, as I pointed out in my Essay on Comparative
Mythology <span id="fr_88"></span>[a](#fn_79), Arushá occurs as a proper
name, as the name of a solar deity, as the bright deity of the morning
(Morgenroth). My interpretation of some of these passages has been
contested, nor shall I deny that in some of them a different
interpretation is possible, and that in looking for traces of Arushá, as
a Vedic deity, representing the morning or the rising sun, and
containing, as I endeavoured to show, the first germs of the Greek name
of Eros, I may have seen more indications of the presence of that deity
in the Veda than others would feel inclined to acknowledge. Yet in going
over the same ground again, I think that even verses which for a time I
felt inclined to surrender, yield a better sense, if we take the word
arushá, which occurs in them as a substantive, as the name of a
matutinal deity, than if we look upon it as an adjective or a mere
appellative. It might be said that wherever this arushá occurs,
apparently as the name of a deity, we ought to supply Agni or Indra or
Sûrya. This is true to a certain extent, for the sun, or the light of
the morning, or the bright sky form no doubt the substance and

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

subject-matter of this deity. But the same applies to many other names
originally intended for these conceptions, but which, nevertheless, in
the course of time, became independent names of independent deities. In
our passage I, 6, 1, yu*ñg*ánti bradhnám arushám, we may retain for
arushá the appellative power of steed or red-steed, but if we could ask
the poet what he meant by this red-steed, or if we ask ourselves what we
can possibly understand by it, the answer would be, the morning sun, or
the light of the morning. In other passages, however, this meaning of
red-steed is really no longer applicable, and we can only translate
Arushá by the Red, understanding by this name the deity of the morning
or of the morning sun, the later Aru*n*a.

VII, 71, 1. ápa svásu*h* ushâsa*h* nák *g*ihîte *rin*ákti
k*ri*sh*n*î´*h* arushâ´ya pánthâm.

The Night retires from her sister, the Dawn; the Dark one yields the
path to the Red one, i. e. the red morning.

Here Arushá shares the same half-mythological character as Ushas. Where
we should speak of dawn and morning as mere periods of time, the Vedic
poet speaks of them as living and intelligent beings, half human, half
divine, as powers of nature capable of understanding his prayers, and
powerful enough to reward his praises. I do not think therefore that we
need hesitate to take Arushá in this passage as a proper name of the
morning, or of the morning sun, to whom the dark goddess, the Night,
yields the path when he rises in the East.

VI, 49, 2. divá*h* *s*í*s*um sáhasa*h* sûnúm agním ya*gñ*ásya ketúm
arushám yá*g*adhyai.

To worship the child of Dyu, the son of strength, Agni, the light of the
sacrifice, the Red one (Arushá.).

In this verse, where the name of Agni actually occurs, it would be
easier than in the preceding verse to translate arushá as an adjective,
referring it either to Agni, the god of fire, or to ya*gñ*ásya ketúm,
the light of the sacrifice. I had myself yielded <span
id="fr_89"></span>[a](#fn_80) so far to these considerations that I

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

gave up my former translation, and rendered this verse by 'to worship
Agni, the child of the sky, the son of strength, the red light of the
sacrifice <span id="fr_90"></span>[a](#fn_81).' But I return to my
original translation, and I prefer to see in Arushá an independent name,
intended, no doubt, for Agni, as the representative of the rising sun
and, at the same time, of the sacrificial fire of the morning, but
nevertheless as having in the mind of the poet a personality of his own.
He is the child of Dyu, originally the offspring of heaven. He is the
son of strength, originally generated by the strong rubbing of the
ara*n*is, i. e. the wood for kindling fire. He is the light of the
sacrifice, whether as reminding man that the time for the morning
sacrifice has come, or as himself lighting the sacrifice on the Eastern
altar of the sky. He is Arushá, originally as clothed in bright red
colour, but gradually changed into the representative of the morning. We
see at once, if examining these various expressions, how some of them,
like the child of Dyu, are easily carried away into mythology, while
others, such as the son of strength, or the light of the sacrifice,
resist that unconscious metamorphosis. That Arushá was infected by
mythology, that it had approached at least that point where nomina
become changed into numina, we see by the verse immediately following:

VI, 49, 3. arushásya duhitárâ vírûpe (íti ví-rûpe) st*rí*bhi*h* anyâ´
pipi*s*é sû´ra*h* anyâ´.

There are two different daughters of Arushá; the one is clad in stars,
the other belongs to the sun, or is the wife of Svar.

Here Arushá is clearly a mythological being, like Agni or Savitar or
Vai*s*vânara; and if Day and Night are called his daughters, he, too,
can hardly have been conceived otherwise than as endowed with human
attributes, as the child of Dyu, as the father of Day and Night, and not
as a mere period of time, not as a mere cause or effect.

IV, 15, 6. tám árvantam ná sânasím arushám ná divá*h* *s*í*s*um
marm*rig*yánte divé-dive.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

They trim the fire day by day, like a strong horse, like Arushá, the
child of Dyu.

Here, too, Arushá, the child of Dyu, has to be taken as a personal
character, and, if the ná after arushám is right, a distinction is
clearly made between Agni, the sacrificial fire, to whom the hymn is
addressed, and Arushá, the child of heaven, the pure and bright morning,
here used as a simile for the cleaning or trimming of the fire on the
altar.

V, 47, 3. arushá*h* su-par*n*á*h*.

Arushá, the morning sun, with beautiful wings.

#### <span class="smallcaps">The Feminine Árushî, as an Adjective.</span>

Árushî, like arushá, is used as an adjective, in the same sense as
arushá, i. e. red:

III, 55, 11. *s*yâ´vî *k*a yát árushî *k*a svá*s*ârau.

As the dark and the red are sisters.

I, 92, 1 and 2. gâ´va*h* árushî*h* and árushî*h* gâ´*h*.

The red cows of the dawn.

I, 92, 2. rû*s*antam bhânúm árushî*h* a*s*i*s*rayu*h*.

The red dawns obtained bright splendour.

Here ushása*h*, the dawns, occur in the same line, so that we may take
árushî*h* either as an adjective, referring to the dawns, or as a
substantive, as a name of the dawn or of her cows.

I, 30, 21. á*s*ve ná *k*itre arushi.

Thou beautiful red dawn, thou, like a mare.

Here, too, the vocative arushi is probably to be taken as an adjective,
particularly if we consider the next following verse:

IV, 52, 2. á*s*vâ-iva *k*itrâ´ árushî mâtâ´ gávâm *ri*tá-varî sákhâ
abhût a*s*víno*h* ushâ´*h*.

The dawn, beautiful and red, like-a mare, the mother of the cows (days),
the never-failing, she became the friend of the A*s*vins.

X, 5, 5. saptá svás*rîh* árushî*h*.

The seven red sisters.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

#### <span class="smallcaps">The Feminine Árushî, as a Substantive.</span>

If used as a substantive, árushî seems to mean the dawn. It is likewise
used as a name of the horses of Agni, Indra, and Soma; also as a name
for mare in general.

It means dawn in X, 8, 3, though the text points here so clearly to the
dawn, and the very name of dawn is mentioned so immediately after, that
this one passage seems hardly sufficient to establish the use of árushî
as a recognised name of the dawn. Other passages, however, would
likewise gain in perspicuity, if we took árushî by itself as a name of
the dawn, just as we had to admit in several passages arushá by itself
as a name of the morning. Cf. I, 71, 1.

Árushî means the horses of Agni, in I, 14, 12:

yukshvá hí árushî*h* ráthe haríta*h* deva rohíta*h*.

Yoke, O god (Agni), the red-horses to the chariot, the bays, the ruddy.

I, 72, 10. prá nî´*k*î*h* agne árushî*h* a*g*ânan.

They knew the red-horses, Agni, coming down. VIII, 69, 5.

Soma, as we saw, was frequently spoken of as arushá*h* hári*h*.

In IX, 111, 2, tridhâ´tubhi*h* árushîbhi*h* seems to refer to the same
red-horses of Soma, though this is not quite clear.

The passages where árushî means simply a mare, without any reference to
colour, are VIII, 68, 18, and VIII, 55, 3.

It is curious that Arushá, which in the Veda means red, should, as
pointed out before, in its Zend form aurusha, mean white. That in the
Veda it means red, and not white, is shown, for instance, by X, 20, 9,
where *s*vetá, the name for white, is mentioned by the side of arushá.
Most likely arushá meant originally brilliant, and became fixed with
different shades of brilliancy in Sanskrit and Persian. Arushá
presupposes a form ar-vas, and is derived from a root ar in the sense of
running or rushing. See Chips from a German Workshop, vol. ii, pp. 135,
137.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

Having thus explained the different meanings of arushá and árushî in the
Rig-veda, I feel it incumbent, at least for once, to explain the reasons
why I differ from the classification of Vedic passages as given in the
Dictionary published by Boehtlingk and Roth. Here, too, the passages in
which arushá is used as an adjective are very properly separated from
those in which it appears as a substantive. To begin with the first, it
is said that 'arushá means ruddy, the colour of Agni and his horses; he
(Agni) himself appears as a red-horse.' In support of this, the
following passages are quoted:

III, 1, 4. ávardhayan su-bhágam saptá yahvî´*h* *s*vetám *g*a*gñ*ânám
arushám mahi-tvâ´, *s*í*s*um ná, *g*âtám abhí âru*h* á*s*vâ*h*. Here,
however, it is only said that Agni was born brilliant-white <span
id="fr_91"></span>[a](#fn_82), and grew red, that the horses came to him
as they come to a new-born foal. Agni himself is not called a red-horse.

III, 7, 5. Here, again, v*rí*sh*n*a*h* arushásya is no doubt meant for
Agni. But v*rí*shan by itself does not mean horse, though it is added to
different names of horses to qualify them as male horses; cf. VII, 69,
I, â´ vâm rátha*h* v*rí*shabhi*h* yâtu á*s*vai*h*, may your chariot come
near with powerful horses, i. e. with stallions. See note to I, 85, 12.
We are therefore not justified in translating arushá v*rí*shan by
red-horse, but only by the red male, or the red hero.

In III, 31, 3, agní*h* *g*a*gñ*e *g*uhvẫ ré*g*amâna*h* mahâ´*h* putrâ´n
arushásya pra-yákshe, I do not venture to say who is meant by the
mahá*h* putrâ´n arushásya, whether Âdityas or Maruts, but hardly the
sons of Agni, as Agni himself is mentioned as only born. But, even if it
were so, the father of these sons (putra) could hardly be intended here
for a horse.

IV, 6, 9. táva tyé agne haríta*h* gh*ri*ta-snâ´*h* róhitâsa*h*
*rig*u-á*ñk*a*h* su-á*ñk*a*h*, arushâ´sa*h* v*rí*sha*n*a*h*
*rig*u-mushkâ´*h*. Here, so far from Agni being represented as a
red-horse, his different horses, the Haríts or bays, the Róhitas or

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

ruddy, and the arushâ´sa*h* v*rí*sha*n*a*h*, the red stallions, are
distinctly mentioned. Here v*rí*shan may be translated by stallion,
instead of simply by male, because arushá is here a substantive, the
name of a horse.

V, 1, 5. *g*ánish*t*a hí *g*énya*h* ágre áhnâm hitá*h* hitéshu arushá*h*
váneshu. Here arushá*h* is simply an adjective, red, referring to Agni,
who is understood throughout the hymn to be the object of praise. He is
said to be kind to those who are kind to him, and to be red in the
woods, i. e. brilliant in the wood which he consumes; cf. III, 29, 6.
Nothing is said about his equine nature.

In V, 12, 2 and 6, VI, 48, 6, we have again simply arushá v*rí*shan,
which does not mean the red-horse, but the red male, the red hero, i. e.
Agni.

In VI, 49, 2, divá*h* *s*í*s*um sáhasa*h* sûnúm agním ya*gñ*ásya ketúm
arushám yá*g*adhyai, there is no trace of Agni being conceived as a
horse. He is called the child of the sky or of Dyu, the son of strength
(who is produced by strong rubbing of wood), the light or the beacon of
the sacrifice, and lastly Arushá, which, for reasons stated above, I
take to be used here as a name.

Next follow the passages in which, according to Professor Roth, arushá,
as an adjective, is said to be applied to the horses, cows, and other
teams of the gods, particularly of the dawn, the A*s*vins, and
B*ri*haspati.

I, 118, 5. pári vâm á*s*vâ*h* vápusha*h* pataṅgâ´*h* váya*h* vahantu
arushâ´*h* abhî´ke. Here we find the váya*h* arushâ´*h* of the A*s*vins,
which it is better to translate by red birds, as immediately before the
winged horses are mentioned. In fact, whenever arushá is applied to the
vehicle of the A*s*vins, it is to be understood of these red birds, IV,
43, 6.

In I, 92, 1 and 2 (not 20), árushî occurs three times, referring twice
to the cows of the dawn, once to the dawn herself.

In IV, 15, 6, tám árvantam ná sânasím arushám ná divá*h* *s*í*s*um
marm*rig*yánte divé-dive, arushá does not refer to the horse or any
other animal of Agni. The verse speaks of a horse by way of comparison
only, and says that the sacrificers clean or trim Agni, the fire, as
people clean a horse. We

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

cannot join arushám in the next pâda with árvantam in the preceding
pâda, for the second ná would then be without any construction. The
construction is certainly not easy, but I think it is safer to
translate: they trim him (Agni), day by day, as they clean a strong
horse, as they clean Arushá, the child of Dyu. In fact, as far as I
know, arushá is never used as the name of the one single horse belonging
to Agni, but always of two or more.

In III, 31, 21, antár (íti) k*ri*sh*n*â´n arushaí*h* dhâ´ma bhi*h* gât,
dhâ´ma bhi*h* is said to mean flames of lightning. But dhâ´man in the
Rig-veda does not mean flames, and it seems better to translate, with
thy red companies, scil. the Maruts.

That arushá in one or two passages means the red cloud, is true. But in
X, 43, 9, arushá refers to the thunderbolt mentioned in the same verse;
and in I, 114, 5, everything refers to Rudra, and not to a red cloud,,
in the proper sense of the word.

Further on, where the meanings attributable to árushî in the Veda are
collected, it is said that árushî means a red mare, also the teams of
Agni and Ushas. Now, here, surely, a distinction should have been made
between those passages in which árushî means a real horse, and those
where it expresses the imaginary steeds of Agni. The former, it should
be observed, occur in one Ma*nd*ala only, and in places of somewhat
doubtful authority, in VIII, 55, 3, a Vâlakhilya hymn, and in VIII, 68,
18, a dânastuti or panegyric. Besides, no passage is given where árushî
means the horses of the dawn, and I doubt whether such a passage exists,
while the one verse where árushî is really used for the horses of Indra,
is not mentioned at all. Lastly, two passages are set apart where árushî
is supposed to mean flames. Now, it may be perfectly true that the
red-horses of Agni are meant for flames, just as the red-horses of Indra
may be the rays of the sun. But, in that case, the red-horses of Agni
should always have been thus translated, or rather interpreted, and not
in one passage only. In IX, 111, 2, árushî is said to mean flames, but
no further light is thrown upon that very difficult passage.

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Note <span id="an_1:6:1:2">2</span>. Pári tasthúsha*h*. I take this form
as a nominative plural like ábibhyusha*h*, I, 11, 5, tvâ´m devâ´*h*
ábibhyusha*h* tu*g*yámânâsa*h* âvishu*h*, 'the gods, stirred up, came to
thee, not fearing;' and like dadúsha*h*, I, 54, 8, yé te indra
dadúsha*h* vardháyanti máhi kshatrám, 'who giving or by their gifts
increase thy great power, O Indra.' Here we might possibly take it as a
gen. sing. referring to te, but dadivân is far more appropriate as an
epithet of the sacrificer than of the god. (See Benfey, Vocativ, p. 24;
and Hermes, p. 16.) It is well known among Sanskrit scholars that
Professor Whitney, in reviewing my translation, declared that the
participial form tasthusha*h* had no right to be anything but an
accusative plural or a genitive or ablative singular. (See Chips from a
German Workshop, vol. iv, p. 508.) Dr. Kern, however, in his translation
of the B*ri*hat-Sa*m*hitâ had shown long before that nom. plur. such as
vidusha*h* are by no means rare, even in the Mahâbhârata and kindred
works. Dr. Lanman (Journ. Americ. Or. Soc. X, p. 513) has now entered
abibhyusha*h* as a nom. plur., but he prefers to take tasthusha*h* as an
acc. plural, so that we should have to translate *k*árantam pári
tasthúsha*h* by 'walking round those who stand.' This may be
grammatically possible; but who could be meant by tasthusha*h*, standing
ones? And, secondly, is it usual in Vedic Sanskrit to say *k*arati pári
tam, he walks round him?' We find pari ta*m* yâti, or tam pari yâti, but
hardly yâti pari tam, 'he goes round him,' except when pari stands
independent of the verb and means 'around,' e. g. IX, 72, 8, pavasva
pári pâ´rthivam rá*g*a*h*. It is more difficult to decide whether we
should adopt Ludwig's interpretation, who takes pari tasthusha*h* in the
sense of 'away from what is firm.' This is correct grammatically, and
tasthivat, as opposed to *g*ágat, is often used in the sense of what is
immovable. But is it ever used in that sense by itself? I doubt it,
though I may add in support of it such a passage as I, 191, 9, út
apaptat asaú sû´rya*h* … âdityá*h* párvatebhya*h*, a verse where the
expression vi*s*vád*ri*sh*t*a*h* ad*rí*sh*t*ahâ´ is analogous to our
ketûm k*rin*ván aketáve. I therefore retain pari tasthusha*h* as a nom.
plural in the sense of standing around, circumstantes, possibly of
pari*k*ara,

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

attendants. Parish*th*âna or sthâna comes to mean an abode, and
paritasthivantas would be bystanders, attendants, the people, in fact,
who are supposed to harness the horse.

Though I do not assign great weight to interpretations of hymns, as
given by the Brâhma*n*as, I may mention that in the Taitt. Br. III, 9,
4, I, paritasthusha*h* is explained as a nom. plur., ime vai lokâ*h*
paritasthusha*h*, while Sâya*n*a in his commentary (Sâma-veda II, 6, 3,
12, i) has parito<sup>ऽ</sup>vasthitâ lokatrayavartina*h* prâ*n*ina*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:6:1:3">3</span>. Ró*k*ante ro*k*anâ´. A similar
expression occurs III, 61, 5, where it is said of Ushas, the dawn, that
she lighted the lights in the sky, prá ro*k*anâ´ ruru*k*e
ra*n*vásand*ri*k.

##### Verse 2.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: They (the charioteers) harness to
his car his two desirable coursers, placed on either hand, bay-coloured,
high-spirited, chief-bearing.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Die lieben Falben schirren sie zu
beiden Seiten des Wagens an, braune, kühne, held-tragende.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Sie spannen seine lieblichen
falben an den wagen mit auseinandergehenden seiten, die blutroten,
mutigen, helden-bringenden.

Note <span id="an_1:6:2:1">1</span>. Although no name is given, the
pronoun asya clearly refers to Indra, for it is he to whom the two bays
belong. The next verse, therefore, must likewise be taken as addressed
to Indra, and not to the sun or the morning-red, spoken of as a horse or
a chariot in the first verse.

Vipakshasâ is well explained by Sâya*n*a, vividhe pakshasî rathasya
pâr*s*vau yayos tau vipakshasau, rathasya dvayo*h* pâr*s*vayor yo*g*itâv
ity artha*h*. The only doubt is whether it refers to the two sides of
the chariot, or of the principal horse. That horses were sometimes yoked
so that one should act as leader, and two should be harnessed on each
side, we see in I, 39, 6, note.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

##### Verse 3.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Mortals, you owe your (daily)
birth (to such an Indra), who, with the rays of the morning, gives sense
to the senseless, and to the formless, form.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Licht machend—Männer!—das Dunkele
and kenntlich das Unkenntliche, entsprangst du mit dem Morgenroth.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Sichtbarkeit schaffend dem
unsichtbaren, gestalt o schmuckreiche (Marut) dem gestaltlosen, wurdet
ihr mit den Ushas zusammen geboren.

Note <span id="an_1:6:3:1">1</span>. In the TB. III, 9, 4, several of
these mantras are enjoined for the A*s*vamedha. When the banner
(dhva*g*a) is fastened, this verse is to be used, because ketu was
supposed to mean a banner. The vocative maryâ*h*, which I have
translated by O men, had evidently become a mere exclamation at a very
early time. Even in our passage it is clear that the poet does not
address any men in particular, for he addresses Indra, nor is marya used
in the general sense of men. It means males, or male offspring. It
sounds more like some kind of asseveration or oath, like the Latin
mehercle, or like the English O ye powers, and it is therefore quoted as
a nipâta or particle in the Vâ*g*. Prâti*s*. II, 16. It can hardly be
taken here as addressed to the Maruts, though the Maruts are the subject
of the next verse. Kluge in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xxv, p. 309, points
out that maryâ*h* as an interjection does not occur again in the
Rig-veda. But the Rig-veda contains many words which occur once only,
and the author of Vâ*g*. Prâti*s*âkhya is no mean authority. See also
Tâ*nd*ya Brâhm. VII, 6, 5. If Dr. Kluge proposes to read mâryâi as a
dative (like λύκῳ) he knows, of course, that such a form does not only
never occur again in the Rig-veda, but never in the whole of Sanskrit
literature. Grassmann and Lanman (N. I., p. 339) both seem to imagine
that the Pada text has marya, but it has maryâ*h*, and no accent. If
maryâ*h* had the accent, we might possibly translate, 'the youths, i. e.
the Maruts, made,' taking k*rin*van for ak*rin*van, or the more usual
akurvan; but in that case the transition to a*g*âyathâ*h* would be very
sudden. See, however, I, 6, 7.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

Sâya*n*a explains it maryâ*h*, manushyâ*h*! idam â*sk*aryam pa*s*yata.
Another explanation of this verse, which evidently troubled the ancient
commentators as much as us, is, 'O mortal, i. e. O sun (dying daily),
thou hast been born with the dawn.'

Note <span id="an_1:6:3:2">2</span>. Ushádbhi*h*, an instrumental plural
which attracted the attention of the author of the Vârttika to Pâ*n*.
VII, 4, 48. It occurs but once, but the regular form, ushobhi*h*, does
not occur at all in the Rig-veda. The same grammarian mentions mâs,
month, as changing the final s of its base into d before bhis. This,
too, is confirmed by RV. II, 24, 5, where mâdbhí*h* occurs. Two other
words, svavas, offering good protection, and svatavas, of independent
strength, mentioned together as liable to the same change, do not occur
with bhi*h* in the Rig-veda, but the forms svavadbhi*h* and
svatavadbhi*h* probably occurred in some other Vedic writings.
Svatavadbhya*h* has been pointed out by Professor Aufrecht in the
Vâ*g*asan. Sa*m*hitâ XXIV, 16, and svatavobhya*h* in *S*atap. Br. II, 5,
I, 14. That the nom. svavân, which is always trisyllabic, is not to be
divided into sva-vân, as proposed by *S*âkalya, but into su-avân, is
implied by Vârttika to Pâ*n*. VIII, 4, 48, and distinctly stated in the
Siddhânta-Kaumudî. That the final n of the nom. su-avân disappeared
before semi-vowels is confirmed by the Sâkala-prâti*s*âkhya, Sûtra 287;
see also Vâ*g*asan. Prâti*s*. III, Sûtra 135 (Weber, Ind. Stud. vol. iv,
p. 206). On the proper division of su-avas, see Aufrecht, Zeitschrift
der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, vol. xiii, p. 499.

##### Verse 4.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Thereafter, verily, those who
bear names invoked in holy rites (the Maruts), having seen the rain
about to be engendered, instigated him to resume his embryo condition
(in the clouds).

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Sodann von freien Stücken gleich

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Da haben nämlich in ihrer

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

Note <span id="an_1:6:4:1">1</span>. Ât must here take vyûha and be
pronounced as an iambus. This is exceptional with ât, but there are at
least two other passages where the same pronunciation is necessary. I,
148, 4, â´t ro*k*ate váne â´ vi-bhâ´-vâ, though in the line immediately
following it is monosyllabic. Also in V, 7, 10, â´t agne ápri*n*ata*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:6:4:2">2</span>. Svadhâ´, literally one's own place,
afterwards, one's own nature. It was a great triumph for the science of
Comparative Philology that, long before the existence of such a word as
svadhâ in Sanskrit was known, it should have been postulated by
Professor Benfey in his Griechisches Wurzellexicon, published in 1839,
and in the appendix of 1842. Svadhâ´ was known, it is true, in the
ordinary Sanskrit, but there it only occurred as an exclamation used on
presenting an oblation to the manes. It was also explained to mean food
offered to deceased ancestors, or to be the name of a personification of
Mâyâ or worldly illusion, or of a nymph. But Professor Benfey, with
great ingenuity, postulated for Sanskrit a noun svadhâ´, as
corresponding to the Greek ἔθος and the German sitte, O. H. G. sit-u,
Gothic sid-u. The noun svadhâ has since been discovered in the Veda,
where it occurs very frequently; and its true meaning in many passages
where native tradition had entirely misunderstood it, has really been
restored by means of its etymological identification with the Greek ἔθος
or ἦθος. See Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 134; vol. xii, p. 158.

The expressions ánu svadhâ´m and svadhâ´m ánu are of frequent
occurrence. They mean, according to the nature or character of the
persons spoken of, and may be translated by as usual, or according to a
person's wont. Thus in our passage we may translate, The Maruts are born
again, i. e. as soon as Indra appeared with the dawn, according to their
wont; they are always born as soon as Indra appears, for such is their
nature.

I, 165, 5. índra svadhâ´m ánu hí na*h* babhû´tha.

For, Indra, according to thy wont, thou art with us.

VIII, 20, 7. svadhâ´m ánu *s*ríyam nára*h*—váhante. According to their
wont, the men (the Maruts) carry splendour.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

Thou hast grown (Indra) according to thy nature.

IV, 33, 6. ánu svadhâ´m *ri*bháva*h* *g*agmu*h* etâ´m.

According to their nature, the *Ri*bhus went to her, scil. the cow; or,
according to this their nature, they came.

IV, 52, 6; I, 33, 11; I, 88, 6; VII, 56, 13; III, 51, 11.

In all these passages svadhâ´ may be rendered by manner, habit, usage,
and ánu svadhâ´m would seem to correspond to the Greek ἐξ ἔθους. Yet the
history of these words in Sanskrit and Greek has not been exactly the
same. First of all we observe in Greek a division between ἔθος and ἦθος,
and whereas the former comes very near in meaning to the Sanskrit
svadhâ, the latter shows in Homer a much more primitive and material
sense. It means in Homer, not a person's own nature, but the own place,
for instance, of animals, the haunts of horses, lions, fish; in Hesiod,
also of men. Hom. Il. XV, 268, μετά τ᾽ ἤθεα καὶ νομὸν ἵππων, loca
consueta et pascua. Svadhâ´ in the Veda does not occur in that sense,
although etymologically it might take the meaning of one's own place:
cf. dhâ-man, familia, &c. Whether in Greek ἦθος, from meaning lair,
haunt, home, came, like νομός and νόμος, to mean habit, manner,
character, which would be quite possible, or whether ἦθος in that
meaning represents a second start from the same point, which in Sanskrit
was fixed in svadhâ´, is impossible to determine. In Sanskrit svadhâ´
clearly shows the meaning of one's own nature, power, disposition. It
does not mean power or nature in general, but always the power of some
one, the peculiarity, the individuality of a person. This will appear
from the following passages:

II, 3, 8. tisrá*h* devî´*k* svadháyâ barhí*h* â´ idám á*kkh*idram pântu.

May the three goddesses protect by their power the sacred pile unbroken.

IV, 13, 5. káyâ yâti svadháyâ.

By what inherent power does he (the Sun) move on?

IV, 26, 4. a*k*akráyâ svadháyâ.

By a power which requires no chariot, i. e. by himself without a
chariot.

The same expression occurs again X, 27, 19.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

In some places the verb mad, to delight, joined with svadháyâ, seems to
mean to revel in his strength, to be proud of his might.

V, 32, 4. svadháyâ mádantam.

V*ri*tra who delights in his strength.

VII, 47, 3. svadháyâ mádantî*h*.

The waters who delight in their strength. See X, 124, 8.

In other passages, however, as we shall see, the same phrase (and this
is rather unusual) requires to be taken in a different sense, so as to
mean to rejoice in food.

I, 164, 38; III, 17, 5.

III, 35, 10. índra píba svadháyâ *k*it sutásya agné*h* vâ pâhi *g*ihváyâ
ya*g*atra.

Indra drink of the libation by thyself (by thy own power), or with the
tongue of Agni, O worshipful.

To drink with the tongue of Agni is a bold but not unusual expression.
V, 51, 2. agné*h* pibata *g*ihváyâ. X, 15, 3.

I, 165, 6. kvâ´ syâ´ va*h* maruta*h* svadhâ´ âsît yát mâ´m ékam
sam-ádhatta ahi-hátye.

Where was that custom of yours, O Maruts, when you left me alone in the
killing of Ahi?

VII, 8, 3. káyâ na*h* agne ví vasa*h* su-v*ri*ktím kâ´m ûm (íti)
svadhâ´m *rin*ava*h* *s*asyámâna*h*.

In what character dost thou light up our work, and what character dost
thou assume, when thou art praised?

IV, 58, 4; IV, 45, 6.

I, 64, 4. sâkám *g*a*gñ*ire svadháyâ.

They (the Maruts) were born together, according to their nature; very
much like ánu svadhâ´m, I, 6, 4. One can hardly render it here by 'they
were born by their own strength,' or 'by spontaneous generation.'

In other passages, however, svadháyâ, meaning originally by its own
power, or nature, comes to mean, by itself, sponte suâ.

VII, 78, 4. â´ asthât rátham svadháyâ yu*g*yámânam.

She, the dawn, mounted the chariot which was harnessed by itself, by its
own power, without requiring the assistance of people to put the horses
to.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

X, 129, 2. â´nît avâtám svadháyâ tát ékam.

That only One breathed breathlessly (or freely) by its own strength,
i. e. by itself.

In the same sense svadhâ´bhi*h* is used in several passages: I, 113, 13.
am*rí*tâ *k*arati svadhâ´bhi*h*.

The immortal Dawn moves along by her own strength, i. e. by herself.

VIII, 10, 6. yát vâ svadhâ´bhi*h* adhi-tísht*h*atha*h* rátham.

Or whether ye mount your chariot by your own strength, ye A*s*vins.

I, 164, 30. *g*îvá*h* m*ri*tásya *k*arati svadhâ´bhi*h* ámartya*h*
mártyena sá-yoni*h*.

The living moves by the powers of the dead, the immortal is the brother
of the mortal. III, 26, 8; V, 60, 4.

There are doubtful passages, such as I, 180, 6, in which the meaning of
svadhâ´bhi*h*, too, is doubtful. In VI, 2, 8, svadhâ´ looks like an
adverb, instead of svadháyâ, and would then refer to pári*g*mâ. The same
applies to VIII, 32, 6.

But svadhâ´ means also food, lit. one's own portion, the sacrificial
offering due to each god, and lastly, food in general.

I, 108, 12. yát indrâgnî (íti) út-itâ sû´ryasya mádhye divá*h* svadháyâ
mâdáyethe (íti).

Whether you, Indra and Agni, delight in your food at the rising of the
sun or at midday.

X, 15, 12. tvám agne î*li*tá*h* *g*âta-veda*h* ávâ*t* havyâ´ni

12\. Thou, O Agni *G*âtavedas, hast carried, when implored, the
offerings which thou hast rendered sweet: thou hast given them to the
fathers, they fed on their share. Eat thou, O god, the proffered
oblations. 13. Our fathers who are here, and those who are not here, our
fathers whom we know and those whom we do not know, thou knowest

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

how many they are, O Gâtavedas, accept the well-made sacrifice with the
sacrificial portions. 14. They who, whether burnt by fire or not burnt
by fire, rejoice in their offering in the midst of heaven, give to them,
O king, that life, and thy (their) own body, according to thy will.

III, 4, 7. saptá p*ri*kshâ´sa*h* svadháyâ madanti.

The seven horses delight in their food.

X, 14, 7. ubhâ´ râ´*g*ânâ svadháyâ mádantâ.

The two kings delighting in their food.

IX, 113, 10. yátra kâ´mâ*h* ni-kâmâ´*h* *k*a, yátra bradhnâsya

Where wishes and desires are, where the cup of the bright Soma is (or,
where the highest place of the sun is), where there is food and
rejoicing, there make me immortal.

I, 154, 4. yásya trî´ pûr*n*â´ mádhunâ padâ´ni ákshîyamâ*n*â svadháyâ

He (Vish*n*u) whose three places, full of sweet, imperishable, delight
or abound in food.

V, 34, 1; II, 35, 7; I, 168, 9; I, 176, 2.

In the tenth book svadhâ is used very much as it occurs in the later
Sanskrit, as the name of a peculiar sacrificial rite.

X, 14, 3. yâ´n *k*a devâ´*h* vav*ri*dhú*h* yé ka devâ´n svâ´hâ anyé
svadháyâ anyé madanti.

Those whom the gods cherish, and those who cherish the gods, the one
delight in Svâhâ, the others in Svadhâ; or, in praise and food.

Note <span id="an_1:6:4:3">3</span>. The expression garbha-tvám â-îrire
is matched by that of III, 60, 3, saudhanvanâ´sa*h* am*ri*ta-tvám â´
îrire, the Saudhanvanas (the *Ri*bhus) obtained immortality, or became
immortal. I do not think that punar erire can mean, as Ludwig supposes,
they pushed away their state of garbha. The idea that the Maruts assumed
the form of a garbha, lit. of an embryo or a new-born child, is only
meant to express that they were born, or that the storms burst forth
from the womb of the sky as soon as Indra arises to do battle against
the demon of darkness. Thus we read, I, 134, 4, á*g*anaya*h* marúta*h*
vakshá*n*âbhya*h*, Thou, Vâyu, hast produced the Maruts from the bowels
(of the sky).

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As assisting Indra
in this battle, the Maruts, whose name retained for a long time its
purely appellative meaning of storms, attained their rank as deities by
the side of Indra, or, as the poet expresses it, they assumed their
sacred name. This seems to be the whole meaning of the later legend that
the Maruts, like the *Ri*bhus, were not originally gods, but became
deified for their works. See also Kern, Translation of
B*ri*hat-sa*m*hitâ, p. 117, note.

Other explanations are: they made that which was born within the cloud
into a garbha or embryo; or, they arose with Âditya, proceeded with
Savitar, and when Savitar set, they became again garbhas; see Sâma-veda
II, 2, 7, 2, comm.

##### <span class="smallcaps">Váhni</span>.

##### Verse 5.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Associated with the conveying
Maruts, the traversers of places difficult of access, thou, Indra, hast
discovered the cows hidden in the cave.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Mit den die Festen brechenden,
den Stû´rmenden fandst, Indra, du die Kû´he in der Grotte gar.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Und mit denen, die das feste
sogar anbrechen, selbst im versteck, o Indra, mit den priesterlichen,
fandest du die morgenstralen auf.

Note <span id="an_1:6:5:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a explains váhnibhi*h* in
the sense of Marúdbhi*h*, and he tells the oft-repeated story how the
cows were carried off by the Pa*n*is from the world of the gods, and
thrown into darkness, and how Indra with the Maruts conquered them and
brought them back. Everybody seems to have accepted this explanation of
Sâya*n*a, and I myself do not venture to depart from it. Yet it should
be stated that the use of váhni as a name of the Maruts is by no means
well established. Váhni is in fact a most difficult word in the Veda. In
later Sanskrit it means fire, and is quoted also as a name of Agni, the
god of fire, but we do not learn why a word which etymologically means
carrier, from vah, to carry, should have assumed the meaning of fire. It
may be that vah, which in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin means chiefly to
carry, expressed originally

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

the idea of moving about (the German be-wegen), in which case váh-ni,
fire, would have been formed with the same purpose as ag-ní, ig-nis,
fire, from Sk. a*g*, ἀγ-ω, ag-o. In Alvis-mal, V, 94, we read, kalla Vág
Vanir, the Wanes call fire Vág, i. e. wavy. But in Sanskrit Agni is so
constantly represented as the carrier of the sacrificial oblation, that
something may also be said in favour of the Indian scholastic
interpreters who take váhni, as applied to Agni, in the sense of
carrier. However that may be, it admits of no doubt that váhni, in the
Veda, is distinctly applied to the bright fire or light. In some
passages it looks very much like a proper name of Agni, in his various
characters of terrestrial and celestial light. It is used for the
sacrificial fire:

V, 50, 4. yátra váhni*h* abhí-hita*h*.

Where the sacrificial fire is placed.

It is applied to Agni:

VII, 7, 5. ásâdi v*ri*tá*h* váhni*h* â-*g*aganvâ´n agní*h* brahmâ´.

The chosen light came nigh, and sat down, Agni, the priest.

Here Agni is, as usual, represented as a priest, chosen like a priest,
for the performance of the sacrifice. But, for that very reason, váhni
may here have the meaning of priest, which, as we shall see, it has in
many places, and the translation would then be more natural: He, the
chosen minister, came near and sat down, Agni, the priest.

VIII, 23, 3. váhni*h* vindate vásu.

Agni finds wealth (for those who offer sacrifices?).

More frequently váhni is applied to the celestial Agni, or other solar
deities, where it is difficult to translate it in English except by an
adjective:

III, 5,i. ápa dvâ´râ támasa*h* váhni*h* âvar (íty âva*h*).

Agni opened the two doors of darkness.

I, 160, 3. sá*h* váhni*h* putrá*h* pitró*h* pavítra-vân punâ´ti
dhî´ra*h* bhúvanâni mâyáyâ.

That light, the son of the two parents, full of brightness, the wise,
brightens the world by his power.

Agni is even called váhni-tama (IV, I, 4), which hardly means more than
the brightest.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

II, 17, 4. â´t ródasî (íti) gyótishâ váhni*h* â´ atanot.

Then the bright (Indra) stretched out or filled heaven and earth with
his light.

II, 38, I. út û*m* (íti) syá*h* devá*h* savitâ´—váhni*h* asthât. The
divine Savitar, the luminous, arose.

Besides this meaning of light or fire, however, there are clearly two
other meanings of váhni which must be admitted in the Veda, first that
of a carrier, vehicle, and, it may be, horse; secondly that of minister
or priest.

VI, 57, 3. a*g*â´*h* anyásya váhnaya*h* hárî (íti) anyásya sámbh*ri*tâ.

The bearers of the one (Pûshan) are goats, the bays are yoked for the
other (Indra).

I, 14, 6. gh*ri*tá-p*ri*sh*th*â*h* mana*h*-yúga*h* yé tvâ váhanti
váhnaya*h*.

The horses with shining backs, obedient to thy will, which carry thee
(Agni).

VIII, 3, 23. yásmai anyé dá*s*a práti dhúram váhanti váhnaya*h*.

A horse against whom other ten horses carry a weight; i. e. it requires
ten horses to carry the weight which this one horse carries. (See X, II,
7. váhamâna*h* á*s*vai*h*.)

II, 37, 3. médyantu te váhnaya*h* yébhi*h* î´yase.

May thy horses be fat on which thou goest. II, 24, 13.

I, 44, 13. *s*rudhí *s*rut-kar*n*a váhni-bhi*h*.

Agni, who hast ears to hear, hear, on thy horses. Unless váhni-bhi*h* is
joined with the words that follow, devaí*h* sayâ´va-bhi*h*.

III, 6, 2. va*k*yántâm te vâhnaya*h* saptá-*g*ihvâ*h* <span
id="fr_92"></span>[a](#fn_83).

May thy seven-tongued horses be called. Here váhnaya*h* is clearly meant
for the flames of Agni, yet I doubt whether we should be justified in
dropping the simile, as the plural of váhni is nowhere used in the bald
sense of flames.

In one passage váhni is supposed to be used as a feminine, or at all
events applied to a feminine subject:

VIII, 94, 1. yuktâ´ váhni*h* ráthânâm.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

She is yoked as the drawer of the chariots. Probably, however, váhni*h*
should here be changed into váhnî.

The passages in which váhni is applied to Soma in the ninth and tenth
Ma*nd*alas throw little light on the subject. (IX, 9, 6; 20, 5; 6; 36,
2; 64, 19; 89, 1; X, 101, 10.)

Instead of vi*s*â´m vi*s*páti*h*, lord of men (VII, 7, 4), we find IX,
108, 10. vi*s*â´m váhni*h* ná vi*s*páti*h*. One feels inclined to
translate here váhni*h* by leader, but it is more likely that váhni is
here again the common name of Soma, and that it is inserted between
vi*s*â´m ná vi*s*páti*h*, which is meant to form one phrase.

In IX, 97, 34, tisrá*h* vâ´*k*a*h* îrayati prá váhni*h*, we may take
váhni as the common appellation of Soma. But it may also mean minister
or priest, as in the passages which we have now to examine. Cf. X, 11,
6.

For besides these passages in which váhni clearly means vector, carrier,
drawer, horse, there is a large class of verses in which it can only be
translated by minister, i. e. officiating minister, and, as it would
seem, chiefly singer or reciter <span id="fr_93"></span>[a](#fn_84).

The verb vah was used in Sanskrit in the sense of carrying out (ud-vah,
ausführen), or performing a rite, particularly as applied to the
reciting of hymns. Hence such compounds as ukthá-vâhas or stoma-vâhas,
offering hymns of praise, and ya*gñ*á-vâhas. Thus we read

V, 79, 4. abhí yé tvâ vibhâ-vari stómai*h* g*rin*ánti váhnaya*h*.

The ministers who praise thee, splendid Dawn, with hymns.

I, 48, 11, yé tvâ g*rin*ánti váhnaya*h*.

The ministers who praise thee.

VII, 75, 5. ushâ´*h* u*kkh*ati váhni-bhi*h* g*rin*ânâ´.

The dawn lights up, praised by the ministers.

VI, 39, 1. mandrásya kavé*h* divyásya váhne*h*.

Of the sweet poet, of the heavenly priest …

VII, 82, 4. yuvâ´m ít yut-sú p*rí*tanâsu váhnaya*h* yuvâ´m kshémasya
pra-savé mitá-*gñ*ava*h*, î*s*ânâ´ vásva*h* ubháyasya kâráva*h*
índrâvaru*n*â su-hávâ havâmahe.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

We, as ministers, invoke you only in fights and battles; we, as
suppliants, (invoke) you for the granting of treasure; we, as poets,
(invoke) you, the lords of twofold wealth, you, Indra and Varu*n*a, who
listen to our call.

VI, 32, 3. sá*h* váhni-bhi*h* *rí*kva-bhi*h* góshu *s*á*s*vat
mitá*gñ*u-bhi*h* puru-k*rí*tvâ *g*igâya.

He (Indra) was victorious often among the cows, always with celebrating
and suppliant ministers.

I have placed these two passages together because they seem to me to
illustrate each other, and to show that although in the second passage
the celebrating and suppliant ministers may be intended for the Maruts,
yet no argument could be drawn from this verse in favour of váhni by
itself meaning the Maruts. See also VIII, 6, 2; 12, 15; X, 114, 2.

IV, 21, 6. hótâ yá*h* na*h* mahâ´n sam-vára*n*eshu váhni*h*.

The Hotar who is our great priest in the sanctuaries.

I, 128, 4. váhni*h* vedhâ´*h* á*g*âyata.

Because the wise priest (Agni) was born.

The same name which in these passages is applied to Agni, is in others,
and, as it will be seen, in the same sense, applied to Indra.

II, 21, 2. tuvi-gráye váhnaye.

To the strong-voiced priest or leader.

The fact that váhni is followed in several passages by ukthaí*h* would
seem to show that the office of the váhni was chiefly that of recitation
or of addressing prayers to the gods.

III, 20, 1. agním ushásam a*s*vínâ dadhi-krâ´m ví-ush*t*ishu havate
váhni*h* ukthaí*h*.

The priest at the break of day calls with his hymns Agni, Ushas, the
A*s*vins, and Dadhikrâ.

I, 184, 1. tâ´ vâm adyá taú aparám huvema u*kkh*ántyâm ushási váhni*h*
ukthaí*h*.

Let us invoke the two A*s*vins to-day and to-morrow, the priest with his
hymns is there when the dawn appears.

In a similar sense, it would seem, as váhni*h* ukthaí*h*, the Vedic
poets frequently use the words váhni*h* âsâ´. This âsâ´ is the
instrumental singular of âs, mouth, and it is used

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

in other phrases also of the mouth as the instrument of praise.

VI, 32, 1. va*g*rí*n*e sám-tamâni vá*k*â*m*si âsâ´ sthávirâya taksham.

I have shaped with my mouth blessed words to the wielder of the
thunderbolt, the strong Indra.

X, 115, 3. âsâ´ váhnim ná *s*o*k*íshâ vi-rap*s*ínam.

He who sings with his flame as the poet with his mouth. See also I, 38,
14. mimîhí *s*lókam âsyẽ, make a song in thy mouth.

Thus we find váhni*h* âsâ´ in the same place in the sixth and seventh
Ma*nd*alas (VI, 16, 9; VII, 16, 9), in the phrase váhni*h* âsâ´
vidú*h*-tara*h*, applied to Agni in the sense of the priest wise with
his mouth, or taking váhni*h* âsâ´ as it were one word, the wise poet.

I, 129, 5. váhni*h* âsâ´, váhni*h* na*h* á*kkh*a.

Indra, as a priest by his lips, as a priest coming towards us.

From the parallelism of this passage it would seem that Professor Roth
concluded the meaning of âsâ´ <span id="fr_94"></span>[a](#fn_85) to be
near,

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

or coram. In the Nigha*nt*u, II, 16, the right reading is evidently
âsât, not âsâ; see Nirukta, ed. Satyavrata Sâma*s*rami, vol. i, p. 264.
Âsâ´, however, is an old variant, as may be seen from Rig-veda-bhâshya
I, 127, 8; X, 115, 3.

I, 76, 4. pra*g*â´-vatâ vá*k*asâ váhni*h* âsâ´ â´ *k*a huvé ní *k*a
satsi ihá devaí*h*.

With words in which my people join, I, the poet, invoke, and thou (Agni)
sittest down with the gods.

VI, 11, 2. pâvakáyâ *g*uhvẫ váhni*h* âsâ´.

Thou, a poet with a bright tongue, O Agni!

Grassmann thinks that vahnir âsâ can always be translated by 'vor das
Angesicht bringend,' but this does not appear to be the case in his
translation.

The question now arises in what sense váhni is used when applied without
further definition to certain deities. Most deities in the Veda are
represented as driving or driven, and many as poets or priests. When the
A*s*vins are called váhnî, VIII, 8, 12; VII, 73, 4, it may mean riders.
But when the Vi*s*ve Devâs are so called, I, 3, 9, or the *Ri*bhus, the
exact meaning is more doubtful. The Maruts are certainly riders, and
whatever other scholars may say to the contrary, it can be proved that
they were supposed to sit astride on horseback, and to have the bridle
through the horse's nostrils (V, 61, 2). But if in our verse I, 6, 5, we
translate váhni as an epithet, rider, and not only as an epithet, but as
a name of the Maruts, we cannot support our translation by independent
evidence, but must rely partly on the authority of Sâya*n*a, partly on
the general tenor of the text before us, where the Maruts are mentioned
in the preceding verse, and, if I am right, in the verse following also.
On the other hand, if váhni can thus be used as a name of

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

the Maruts, there is at least one other passage which would gain in
clearness by the admission of that meaning, viz.

X, 138, 1. táva tyé indra sakhyéshu váhnaya*h*—ví adardiru*h* valám.

In thy friendship, Indra, these Maruts tore asunder the cloud.

Note <span id="an_1:6:5:2">2</span>. I have translated vî*l*ú by
stronghold, though it is only an adjective, meaning firm. Dr. Oscar
Meyer, in his able essay Quaestiones Homericae, specimen prius, Bonnae,
1867, has tried to show that this vî*l*ú is the original form of Ἴλιος,
and he has brought some further evidence to show that the siege and
conquest of Troy, as I pointed out in my Lectures on the Science of
Language, vol. ii, p. 470, was originally described in language borrowed
from the siege and conquest of the dark night by the powers of light, or
from the destruction of the cloud by the weapons of Indra. It ought to
be considered, however, that vî*l*ú in the Veda has not dwindled down as
yet to a mere name, and that therefore it may have originally retained
its purely appellative power in Greek as well as in Sanskrit, and from
meaning a stronghold in general, have come to mean the stronghold of
Troy.

Note <span id="an_1:6:5:3">3</span>. The bright cows are here the cows
of the morning, the dawns, or the days themselves, which are represented
as rescued at the end of each night by the power of Indra, or similar
solar gods. Indra's companions in that daily rescue are here the Maruts,
the storms, the same companions who act even a more prominent part in
the battle of Indra against the dark clouds. These two battles are often
mixed up together, so that possibly usríyâ*h* may have been meant for
clouds.

##### Verse 6.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: The reciters of praises praise
the mighty (troop of Maruts), who are celebrated, and conscious of the
power of bestowing wealth in like manner as they (glorify) the
counsellor (Indra).

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Nach ihrer Einsicht
verherrlichend besingen Sänger den Schätzeherrn, den berühmten,
gewaltigen.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Als fromme heran zum liede haben
die sänger ihn, der trefliches findet, berühmten gesungen.

Note <span id="an_1:6:6:1">1</span>. The reasons why I take gíra*h* as a
masculine in the sense of singer or praiser, may be seen in a note to I,
37, 10.

Note <span id="an_1:6:6:2">2</span>. yáthâ matím, lit. according to
their mind, according to their heart's desire. Cf. II, 24, 13.

##### Verse 7.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: May you be seen, Maruts,
accompanied by the undaunted (Indra); both rejoicing, and of equal
splendour.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: So lass mit Indra denn vereint,
dem furchtlosen, erblicken dich, beide erfreu’nd und glanzesgleich.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Mit Indra zusammen wirst du
gesehn zusammengehend mit dem furchtlosen, mild ihr zwei, von gleichem
glanze.

Note <span id="an_1:6:7:1">1</span>. The sudden transition from the
plural to the singular is strange, but the host of the Maruts is
frequently spoken of in the singular, and nothing else can here be
intended. It may be true, as Professor Benfey suggests, that the verses
here put together stood originally in a different order, or that they
were taken from different sources. Yet though the Sâma-veda would seem
to sanction a small alteration in the order of the verses, the
alteration of verses 7, 4, 5, as following each other, would not help us
much. The Atharva-veda sanctions no change in the order of these verses.

The transition to the dual at the end of the verse is likewise abrupt,
not more so, however, than we are prepared for in the Veda. The
suggestion of the Nirukta (IV, 12) that these duals might be taken as
instrumentals of the singular, is of no real value.

Note <span id="an_1:6:7:2">2</span>. D*rí*kshase, a very valuable form,
well explained by d*ris*yethâ*h*, a second person singular conjunctive
of the First Aorist Âtmanepada, the termination 'sase' corresponding to
Greek σῃ, as the conjunctive takes the personal terminations of the
present in both languages. Similar

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

forms, viz. p*ri*kshase, X, 22, 7, ma*m*sase, X, 27, 10; Ath. Veda VII,
20, 2-6, and possibly vívakshase, X, 21, 1-8, 24, 1-3, 25, 1-11, will
have to be considered hereafter. (Nirukta, ed. Roth, p. 30, Notes.) As
Ludwig has pointed out, the Tâ*nd*ya-brâhma*n*a XII, 2, 6, 7, reads
d*ri*kshuse, and explains it by ime lokâ dad*ris*ire. Sâya*n*a, however,
explains d*ris*idhâto*h* karma*n*i madhyamaikava*k*ane vyatyayena
sepratyaye d*ri*kshusa iti rûpam. See Delbrück, Syntaktische
Forschungen, I, p. 111. The story of Indra's being forsaken by all the
gods in his battle against V*ri*tra, but being helped by the Maruts, is
often mentioned; see RV. VIII, 96, 7; SV. I, 4, 1, 4, 2; Ait. Br. III,
20.

##### Verse 8.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: This rite is performed in
adoration of the powerful Indra, along with the irreproachable,
heavenward-tending, and amiable bands (of the Maruts).

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Durch Indra's liebe Schaaren, die
untadligen, himmelstürmenden, strahlet das Opfer mächtiglich.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Mit den tadellosen, morgens
erscheinenden singt der kämpfer sighaft, mit des Indra zu liebenden
scharen.

Note <span id="an_1:6:8:1">1</span>. Ar*k*ati, which I have here
translated by he cries aloud, means literally, he celebrates. I do not
know of any passage where ar*k*ati, when used, as here, without an
object, means to shine, as Professor Benfey translates it. The real
difficulty, however, lies in makhá, which Sâya*n*a explains by
sacrifice, and which I have ventured to translate by priest or
sacrificer. Makhá, as an adjective, means, as far as we can judge,
strong or vigorous, and is applied to various deities, such as Pûshan I,
138, 1, Savit*ri* VI, 71, 1, Soma XI, 20, 7, Indra III, 34, 2, the
Maruts I, 64, 11; VI, 66, 9. By itself, makhá is never used as the name
of any deity, and it cannot therefore, as Professor Roth proposes, be
used in our passage as a name of Indra, or be referred to Indra as a
significant adjective. In I, 119, 3, makhá is applied to men or
warriors, but it does not follow that makhá by itself means warriors,
though it maybe connected

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

with the Greek μαχος in σύμμαχος. See Curtius, Grundzüge, p. 293;
Grassmann, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 164.

There are two passages where makhá refers to an enemy of the gods, IX,
101, 13; X, 171, 2.

Among the remaining passages there is one where makhá is used in
parallelism with váhni, X, 11, 6. vívakti váhni*h*, su-apasyáte
makhá*h*. Here I propose to translate, The poet speaks out, the priest
works well. The same meaning seems applicable likewise to the phrase
makhásya dâváne, to the offering of the priest, though I should prefer
to translate 'to share in the sacrifice.'

I, 134, 1. â´ yâhi dâváne, vâ´yo (íti), makhásya dâváne.

Come, Vâyu, to the offering, to the offering of the priest.

VIII, 7, 27. â´ na*h* makhásya dâváne—dévâsa*h* ûpa gantana.

Come, gods, to the offering of our priest.

Professor Roth proposes to render makhá in these passages by
'attestation of joy, celebration, praise,' and he takes dâváne as a
dative of dâván, a nomen actionis, meaning, the giving. There are some
passages where one feels inclined to admit a noun dâvána, and to take
dâváne as a locative sing.

VI, 71, 2. devásya vayám savitû*h* sávîmani  
           *s*résh*th*e syâma vásuna*h* *k*a dâváne.

May we be in the favour of the god Savitar, and in the best award of his
treasure.

In II, 11, 1, and II, 11, 12, the locative would likewise be preferable;
but there is a decided majority of passages in which dâváne occurs and
where it is to be taken as a dative <span id="fr_95"></span>[a](#fn_86),
nor is there any other instance in the Veda of a nomen actionis being
formed by vana. It is better, therefore, in VI, 71, 2, to refer
*s*résh*th*e to sávîmani, and to make allowance in the other passages
for the idiomatic use of such phrases as dâváne vásûnâm or râyá*h*
dâváne, whether from dâ or from do. See De Infinitivi forma et usu, by
E. Wilhelm, 1873, p. 17.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

The termination váne explains, as has been shown by Professor Benfey,
Greek infinitives such as δοῦναι, i. e. δοεναι or δοϝεναι = Sanskrit
dâ-váne. The termination mane in dâ´-mane, for the purpose of giving,
explains, as the same scholar has proved, the ancient infinitives in
Greek, such as δό-μεναι. It may be added that the regular infinitives in
Greek, ending in εναι, as λελοιπ-έναι, are likewise matched by Vedic
forms such as IX, 61, 30. dhû´rv-ane, or VI, 61, 13. vibhv-áne, and
turv-áne (Delbrück in K. Z. XVIII, p. 82; Bopp, Accent, §§106, 113,
117). It is hardly right to say that vibhváne in VI, 61, 13, should be
taken as an instrumental, for it does not refer to the chariot, but to
Sarasvatî. In the termination ειν, which stands for ενι, like εις for
εσι, we have, on the contrary, not a dative, but a locative of an
abstract noun in an, both cases, as we see from their juxta-position in
VI, 71, 2, being equally applicable to express the relation which we are
accustomed to call infinitive. See RV. I, 134, 5. ugrâ´*h* isha*n*anta
bhurvá*n*i, apâ´m ishanta bhurvá*n*i.

Note <span id="an_1:6:8:2">2</span>. Abhidyu I now translate by
hastening, and derive it from div, dîvyati, in its original meaning of
to throw forth, to break forth, to shine. As from this root we have
didyú, weapon, what is thrown, pl. didyava*h*, and possibly didyut, the
weapon, particularly Indra's weapon or thunderbolt, abhídyu might mean
breaking forth, rushing forth towards us, something like
prakrî*l*ína*h*, another name of the Maruts. How abhídyu could mean
conquérant, maître du jour, as M. Bergaigne maintains, I do not see.
Abhídyû´n, I, 33, I I; 190, 4, does not differ much from ánudyû´n, i. e.
it is used vîpsâyâm.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: We invoke Indra,—whether he come
from this earthly region, or from the heaven above, or from the vast
firmament,—that he may give (us) wealth.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Von hier, oder vom Himmel ob der

Note <span id="an_1:6:9:1">1</span>. Although the names for earth, sky,
and heaven vary in different parts of the Veda, yet the expression
divá*h* ro*k*anám occurs so frequently that we can hardly take it in
this place in a sense different from its ordinary meaning. Professor
Benfey thinks that ro*k*aná may here mean ether, and he translates 'come
from heaven above the ether;' and in the next verse, 'come from heaven
above the earth.' At first, every reader would feel inclined to take the
two phrases, divá*h* vâ ro*k*anâ´t ádhi, and divá*h* vâ pâ´rthivât ádhi,
as parallel; yet I believe they are not quite so.

The following passages will show that the two words ro*k*anám divá*h*
belong together, and that they signify the light of heaven, or the
bright place of heaven.

VIII, 98, 3. ága*kkh*a*h* ro*k*anám divá*h*.

Thou (Indra) wentest to the light of heaven. I, 155, 3.

III, 6, 8. uraú vâ yé antárikshe—divá*h* vâ yé ro*k*ané.

In the wide sky, or in the light of heaven.

VIII, 82, 4. upamé ro*k*ané divá*h*.

In the highest light of heaven.

IX, 86, 27. t*ri*tî´ye p*ri*sh*th*é ádhi ro*k*ané divá*h*.

On the third ridge, in the light of heaven. See also I, 105, 5; VIII,
69, 3.

The very phrase which we find in our verse, only with *k*it instead of
vâ, occurs again, I, 49, I; VIII, 8, 7; and the same sense must probably
be assigned to VIII, 1, 18, ádha *g*má*h* ádha vâ divâ*h* b*ri*hatá*h*
ro*k*anâ´t ádhi.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

Either from the earth, or from the light of the great heaven, increase,
O Indra!

Ro*k*aná also occurs in the plural:

I, 146, 1. ví*s*vâ divá*h* ro*k*anâ´.

All the bright regions of heaven.

Sâya*n*a: 'All the bright palaces of the gods.' See III, 12, 9.

The same word ro*k*aná, and in the same sense, is sometimes joined with
sû´rya and nâ´ka.

Thus, I, 14, 9. sû´ryasya ro*k*anâ´t ví*s*vân devâ´n—hótâ ihá vakshati.

May the Hotar bring the Vi*s*ve Devas hither from the light of the sun,
or from the bright realm of the sun.

III, 22, 3. yâ´*h* ro*k*ané parástât sû´ryasya.

The waters which are above, in the bright realm of the sun, and those
which are below.

I, 19, 6. yé nâ´kasya ádhi ro*k*ané, diví devâ´sa*h* â´sate.

They who in the light of the firmament, in heaven, are enthroned as
gods.

Here diví, in heaven, seems to be the same as the light of the
firmament, nâ´kasya ro*k*ané.

Thus ro*k*aná occurs also frequently by itself, when it clearly has the
meaning of heaven.

It is said of the dawn, I, 49, 4; of the sun, I, 50, 4; and of Indra,
III, 44, 4.

ví*s*vam â´ bhâti ro*k*anám, he lights up the whole sky.

We also read of three ro*k*anas, where, though it is difficult to say
what is really meant, we must translate, the three skies. The
cosmography of the Veda is, as I said before, somewhat vague and
varying. There is, of course, the natural division of the world into
heaven and earth (dyú and bhû´mi), and the threefold division into
earth, sky, and heaven, where sky is meant for the region intermediate
between heaven and earth (p*ri*thivî´, antáriksha, dyú). There is also a
fourfold division, for instance,

VIII, 97, 5.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

yát vâ ási ro*k*ané divá*h*  
samudrásya ádhi vish*t*ápi,  
yát pâ´rthive sádane v*ri*trahan-tama,  
yát antárikshe â´ gahi.

</div>

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

Whether thou, O greatest killer of V*ri*tra, art in the light of heaven,
or in the basin of the sea, or in the place of the earth, or in the sky,
come hither!

V, 52, 7. yé vav*ri*dhánta pâ´rthivâ*h* yé uraú antárikshe â´, vri*g*áne
vâ nadî´nâm sadhá-sthe vâ mahá*h* divá*h*.

The Maruts who grew, being on the earth, those who are in the wide sky,
or in the realm of the rivers, or in the abode of the great heaven.

But very soon these three or more regions are each spoken of as
threefold. Thus,

I, 102, 8. tisrá*h* bhû´mî*h* trî´*n*i ro*k*anâ´.

The three earths, the three skies.

II, 27, 9. trî´ ro*k*anâ´ divyâ´ dhârayanta.

The Âdityas support the three heavenly skies.

V, 69, 1. trî´ ro*k*anâ´ varu*n*a trî´n utá dyû´n trî´*n*i mitra
dhârayatha*h* rá*g*â*m*si.

Mitra and Varu*n*a, you support the three lights, and the three heavens,
and the three skies.

Here there seems some confusion, which Sâya*n*a's commentary makes even
worse confounded. What can ro*k*anâ´ mean as distinct from dyú and
rá*g*as? The fourth verse of the same hymn throws no light on the
subject, and I should feel inclined to take divyâ´-pâ´rthivasya as one
word, though even then the cosmic division here adopted is by no means
clear. However, there is a still more complicated division alluded to in
IV, 53, 5:

trí*h* antáriksham savitâ´ mahi-tvanâ´ trî´ rá*g*â*m*si pari-bhû*h*
trî´*n*i ro*k*anâ´, tisrá*h* díva*h* p*ri*thivî´*h* tisrá*h* invati.

Here we have the sky thrice, three welkins, three lights, three heavens,
three earths.

A careful consideration of all these passages will show, I think, that
in our passage we must take divá*h* vâ ro*k*anâ´t ádhi in its usual
sense, and that we cannot separate the two words.

In the next verse, on the contrary, it seems equally clear that divá*h*
and pâ´rthivât must be separated. At all events there is no passage in
the Rig-veda where pâ´rthiva is joined as an adjective with dyú.
Pâ´rthiva as an adjective is frequently joined with rá*g*as, never with
dyú. See I, 81,

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 5; 99, 7; VIII,
88, 5; IX, 72, 8: in the plural, I, 154, 1; V, 81, 3; VI, 31, 2; 49, 3.

Pâ´rthivâni also occurs by itself, when it refers to the earth. as
opposed to the sky and heaven.

X, 32, 2. ví indra yâsi divyâ´ni ro*k*anâ´ ví pâ´rthivâni rá*g*asâ.

Indra thou goest in the sky between the heavenly lights and the earthly.

VIII, 94, 9. â´ yé ví*s*vâ pâ´rthivâni papráthan ro*k*anâ´ divá*h*.

The Maruts who stretched out all the earthly lights, and the lights of
heaven.

VI, 61, 11. â-paprúshî pâ´rthivâni urú rá*g*a*h* antáriksham.

Sarasvatî filling the earthly places, the wide welkin, the sky. This is
a doubtful passage.

Lastly, pâ´rthivâni by itself seems to signify earth, sky, and heaven,
if those are the three regions which Vish*n*u measured with his three
steps; or east, the zenith, and west, if these were intended as the
three steps of that deity. For we read:

I, 155, 4. yá*h* pâ´rthivâni tri-bhí*h* ít vígâma-bhi*h* urú
krámish*t*a.

He (Vish*n*u) who strode wide with his three strides across the regions
of the earth.

These two concluding verses might also be taken as containing the actual
invocation of the sacrificer, which is mentioned in verse 8. In that
case the full stop at the end of verse 8 should be removed.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[42:a](sbe3216.htm#fr_94) As, mouth, the Latin
os, oris, has been derived from a root as, to breathe, preserved in the
Sanskrit as-u, spirit, asu-ra, endowed with spirit, living, the living
god. Though I agree with Curtius in admitting a primitive root as, to
breathe, from which as-u, breath, must have sprung, I have always
hesitated about the derivation of âs and âsya, mouth, from the same
root. I do not think, however, that the lengthening of the vowel in âs
is so great a difficulty as has been supposed (Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol.
xvii, p. 145). Several roots lengthen their vowel a, when used as
substantives without derivative suffixes. In some cases this lengthening
is restricted to the Aṅga base, as in ana*d*vâh; in others to the Aṅga
and Pada base, as in vi*s*vavâ*t*, vi*s*vavâ*d*bhi*h*, &c.; in others
again it pervades the whole declension, as in turâshâ*t*: (see Sanskrit
Grammar, §§ 210, 208, 175.) Among ordinary words vâ*k* offers a clear
instance of a lengthened vowel. In the Veda we find *ri*tîsháham, VI,
14, 4, and *ri*tîshâ´ham (Sa*m*hitâ), I, 64, 15. In X, 71, 10 the
Sa*m*hitâ has sabhâsâhéna, the Pada sabhâsahéna. We find vâh in apsu-vâh
(Sâm. Ved.), indra-vâh, havya-vâh. Sah at the end of compounds, such as
n*ri*-sah, p*ri*tanâ-sah, bhûri-sah, satrâ-sah, vibhâ-sah, sadâ-sah,
varies between a long and short â: (see Regnier, Étude sur l’idiome du
<span id="page_43">p. 43</span> Védas, p. 111.) At all events no
instance has yet been pointed out in Sanskrit, showing the same
contraction which we should have to admit if, as has been proposed, we
derived âs from av-as, or from an-as. From 'an' we have in the Veda âná,
mouth or face, I, 52, 15. From as, to breathe, the Latin omen,
originally os-men, a whisper, might likewise be derived. See Bopp, Comp.
