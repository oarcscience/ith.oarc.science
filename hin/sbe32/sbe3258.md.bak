### MA*ND*ALA VI, HYMN 74.

#### ASH*T*AKA V, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 18.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To Soma and Rudra</span>.

1\. Soma and Rudra, may you maintain your divine dominion, and may the
oblations reach you properly. Bringing the seven treasures to every
house, be kind to our children and our cattle.

2\. Soma and Rudra, draw far away in every direction
[1](sbe3258.htm#an_6:74:2:1) the disease [2](sbe3258.htm#an_6:74:2:2.md)
which has entered our house. Drive far away Nir*ri*ti
[3](sbe3258.htm#an_6:74:2:3.md), and may auspicious glories belong to us!

3\. Soma and Rudra, bestow all these remedies on our bodies. Tear away
and remove from us  [1](sbe3258.htm#an_6:74:3:1.md) whatever evil we have
committed, which clings to our bodies.

4\. Soma and Rudra, wielding sharp weapons and sharp bolts, kind
friends, be gracious unto us here! Deliver us from the snare of
Varu*n*a, and guard us, as kind-hearted gods!

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Bhâradvâ*g*a Bârhaspatya. Verse 2 occurs TS. I, 8, 22, 5;
AV. VII, 42, 1; verse 3, TS. I, 8, 22, 5; AV. VII, 42, 2. All the four
verses, but in a different order (3, 1, 2, 4), in MS. IV, 11, 2; see
also Kâ*th*. XI, 12. Metre, Trish*t*ubh.

This is the only hymn addressed to Soma and Rudra. In the *Kh*ândogya
Up. III, 7 and 9, the Rudras are said to have Indra, while the Maruts
have Soma at their head.

It is translated by Geldner and Kaegi.

The whole hymn betrays its secondary character; first by violating the
law of decrease, secondly by duals in au before consonants, and thirdly
by using a very large number of passages from other hymns. Compare verse
1, pâda c, with V, 1, 5, c; verse 2, pâda c, with I, 24, 9, c; verse 2,
pâda d, with VI, 1, 12, d. Phrases like verse 1, pâda d, *s*ám na*h*
bhûtam dvipáde *s*ám *k*átu*h*pade, occur again and again, with slight
modifications; see I, 114, 1; 157, 3; VII, 54, 1; X, 165, 1.
Sumanasyámânâ also is suspicious. It occurs again in the next hymn, the
last of the Ma*nd*ala, in VII, 33, 14, likewise a suspected hymn, and in
the tenth Ma*nd*ala, X, 51, 5; 7.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_6:74:2:1">1</span>. On víshû*k*îm, see II, 33, 2.

Note <span id="an_6:74:2:2">2</span>. Ámîvâ has been identified with
ἀνῑα by Fick, Orient und Occident, III, p. 121. The difficulty is m = n.

Note <span id="an_6:74:2:3">3</span>. The AV. reads bâ´dhethâm dûrám
nír*ri*tim, the AV. and TS. read parâ*k*aí*h* k*ri*tám *k*id éna*h* prá
mumuktam asmát.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_6:74:3:1">1</span>. AV. reads asmát for asmé, and ásat
for ásti. Verse 4. In the Maitr. S. the second half of this verse is,
mumuktám asmâ´n grasitâ´n abhî´ke prá ya*kkh*atam v*ri*sha*n*â
*s*ántamâni.
