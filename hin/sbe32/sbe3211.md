Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we declare ourselves free from all authority, either grammatical or
metrical, we may either sacrifice all grammar to metre, or all metre to
grammar. We may introduce the strictest rules of metre, determining the
length or shortness of every syllable, and then ignore all rules of
grammar and quantity, treat short syllables as long, or long ones as
short, and thus secure the triumph of metre. Or, we may allow great
latitude in Vedic metres, particularly in certain pâdas, and thus retain
all the rules of grammar which determine the quantity of syllables. It
may be said even that the result would really be the same in either
case, and that the policy of 'thorough' might perhaps prove most useful
in the end. It may be so hereafter, but in the present state of Vedic
scholarship it seems more expedient to be guided by native tradition,
and to study the compromise which the ancient students of the Veda have
tried to effect between grammar on one side and metre on the other.

Now it has generally been supposed that the Prâti*s*âkhya teaches that
there must be a long syllable in the eighth or tenth place of
Traish*t*ubha and *G*âgata, and in the sixth place of Ânush*t*ubha
pâdas. This is not the case. The Prâti*s*âkhya, no doubt, says, that a
short final vowel, but not any short syllable, occupying the eighth or
tenth place in a Traish*t*ubha and *G*âgata pâda, or the sixth place in
a Gâyatra pâda, is lengthened, but it never says that it must be
lengthened; on the contrary, it gives a number of cases where it is not
so lengthened. But, what is even more important, the Prâti*s*âkhya
distinctly adds a proviso which shows that the ancient critics of the
Veda did not consider the trochee as the only possible foot for the
sixth and seventh syllables of Gâyatra, or for the eighth and ninth, or
tenth and eleventh syllables of Traish*t*ubha and *G*âgata pâdas. They
distinctly admit that the seventh and the

<span id="page_xc">p. xc</span>

ninth and the eleventh syllables in such pâdas may be long, and that in
that case the preceding short vowel is not lengthened. We thus get the
iambus in the very place which is generally occupied by the trochee.
According to the Prâti*s*âkhya, the general scheme for the Gâyatra would
be, not only

Before appealing, however, to the Prâti*s*âkhya for the establishment of
such a rule as that the sixth syllable of Ânush*t*ubha and the eighth or
tenth syllable of Traish*t*ubha and *G*âgata pâdas must be lengthened,
provided a short syllable follows, it is indispensable that we should
have a clear appreciation of the real character of the Prâti*s*âkhya. If
we carefully follow the thread which runs through these books, we shall
soon perceive that, even with the proviso that a short syllable follows,
the Prâti*s*âkhya never teaches that certain final vowels must be
lengthened. The object of the Prâti*s*âkhya, as I pointed out on a
former occasion, is to register all the facts which possess a phonetic
interest. In doing this, all kinds of plans are adopted in order to
bring as large a number of cases as possible under general categories.
These categories are purely technical and external, and they never
assume, with the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya, the character of general
rules. Let us now, after these preliminary remarks, return to the Sûtras
523 to 535, which we discussed before. The Prâti*s*âkhya simply says
that certain syllables which are short in the

<span id="page_xci">p. xci</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pada, if occupying
a certain place in a verse, are lengthened in the Sa*m*hitâ, provided a
short syllable follows. This looks, no doubt, like a general rule which
should be carried out under all circumstances. But this idea never
entered the minds of the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya. They only give
this rule as the most convenient way of registering the lengthening of
certain syllables which have actually been lengthened in the text of the
Sa*m*hitâ, while they remain short in the Pada; and after having done
this, they proceed to give a number of verses where the same rule might
be supposed to apply, but where in the text of the Sa*m*hitâ the short
syllable has not been lengthened. After having given a long string of
words which are short in the Pada and long in the Sa*m*hitâ, and where
no intelligible reason of their lengthening can be given, at least not
by the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya, the Prâti*s*âkhya adds in Sûtra
523, 'The final vowel of the eighth syllable is lengthened in pâdas of
eleven and twelve syllables, provided a syllable follows which is short
in the Sa*m*hitâ.' As instances the commentator gives (Sa*m*hitâ text):

I, 32, 4. tâ̄dî̅´tnâ̄ *s*á̄t̍rūm ná̆ kí̆lă̂ ̍ vĭvītsē.

I, 94, 1. á̄gnē sākhyé̄ m̍â´ rĭshâ̄mă̂ v̍ăyá̄m tá̆vă.

Then follows another rule (Sûtra 525) that 'The final vowel of the tenth
syllable in pâdas of eleven and twelve syllables is lengthened, provided
a syllable follows which is short in the Sa*m*hitâ.' As instances the
commentator gives:

III, 54, 22. á̆hâ̄ ví̄*s*vâ̄ ̍ sŭmá̆nâ̄ dî̄̍dĭhĭ̂ nā*h*.

II, 34, 9. á̆vă rūdrâ̄̍ ăsá̆sō hān̍tănă̂ vá̆dhā*h*.

Lastly a rule is given (Sûtra 526) that 'The final vowel of the sixth
syllable is lengthened in a pâda of eight syllables, provided a syllable
follows which is short

I, 5, 10. î̅´*s*â̄nō yăv̍ăyă̂ vădhá̄m.

If the seventh syllable is long no change takes place:

IX\. 67, 30. â̅´ păvāsvā dēvă sōmā.

While we ourselves should look upon these rules as

<span id="page_xcii">p. xcii</span>

founded in the very nature of the metre, which, no doubt, to a certain
extent they are, the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya use them simply as
convenient nets for catching as many cases as possible of lengthened
syllables actually occurring in the text of the Sa*m*hitâ. For this
purpose, and in order to avoid giving a number of special rules, they
add in this place an observation, very important to us as throwing light
on the real pronunciation of the Vedic hymns at the time when our
Sa*m*hitâ text was finally settled, but with them again a mere expedient
for enlarging the preceding rules, and thus catching more cases of
lengthening at one haul. They say in Sûtra 527, that in order to get the
right number of syllables in such verses, we must pronounce sometimes
one syllable as two. Thus only can the lengthened syllable be got into
one of the places required by the preceding Sûtra, viz. the sixth, the
eighth, or the tenth place, and thus only can a large number of
lengthened syllables be comprehended under the same general rule of the
Prâti*s*âkhya. In all this we ourselves can easily recognise a principle
which guided the compilers of the Sa*m*hitâ text, or the very authors of
the hymns, in lengthening syllables which in the Pada text are short,
and which were liable to be lengthened because they occupied certain
places on which the stress of the metre would naturally fall. We also
see quite clearly that these compilers, or those whose pronunciation
they tried to perpetuate, must have pronounced certain syllables as two
syllables, and we naturally consider that we have a right to try the
same expedient in other cases where to us, though not to them, the metre
seems deficient, and where it could be rendered perfect by pronouncing
one syllable as two. Such thoughts, however, never entered the minds of
the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhyas, who are satisfied with explaining
what is, according to the authority of the Sa*m*hitâ, and who never
attempt to say what ought to be, even against the authority of the
Sa*m*hitâ. While in some cases they have ears to hear and to appreciate
the natural flow of the poetical language of the *Ri*shis, they seem at
other times as deaf as the adder to the voice of the charmer.

<span id="page_xciii">p. xciii</span>

A general rule, therefore, in our sense of the word, that the eighth
syllable in hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, the tenth syllable in
hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, and the sixth syllable in
octosyllabics should be lengthened, rests in no sense on the authority
of ancient grammarians. Even as a mere observation, they restrict it by
the condition that the next syllable must be short, in order to provoke
the lengthening of the preceding syllable, thereby sanctioning, of
course, many exceptions; and they then proceed to quote a number of
cases where, in spite of all, the short syllable remains short <span
id="fr_54"></span>[a](#fn_45.md). In some of these quotations they are no
doubt wrong, but in most of them their statement cannot be disputed.

As to the eighth syllable being short in hendecasyllabics and
dodecasyllabics, they quote such verses as,

VI, 66, 4. āntār (íti) sāntă*h* ăvādyâ̄nĭ pŭnâ̄nâ̄*h*.

Thus we see that in VI, 44. 9, vārshî̄yā*h* văyā*h* k*rĭn*ŭhĭ
*s*ă*k*î̄bhī*h*, hi remains short; while in VI, 25, 3, *g*ăhĭ
v*ri̅*sh*n*yâ̄nĭ k*rĭn*ŭhî̄ părâ̄*k*ā*h*, it is lengthened in the Sa*m*hitâ,
the only difference being that in the second passage the accent is on
hí.

As to the tenth syllable being short in a dodecabyllabic, they quote

II, 27, 14. ădĭtē mītră vărŭ*n*ă ŭtă m*rĭl*ā.

As to the tenth syllable being short in a hendecasyllabic, they quote

II, 20, 1. v̆ayām tē văyă*h* īndră vīddhĭ sŭ nā*h*.

As to the sixth syllable being short in an octosyllabic, they quote

VIII, 23, 26. măhā*h* vī*s*vâ̄n ăbhĭ sătā*h*.

A large number of similar exceptions are collected from

<span id="page_xciv">p. xciv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 528, 3 to 534, 94,
and this does not include any cases where the ninth, the eleventh, or
the seventh syllable is long, instead of being short, while it does
include cases where the eighth syllable is long, though the ninth is not
short, or, at least, is not short according to the views of the
collectors of these passages. See Sûtra 522, 6.

Besides the cases mentioned by the Prâti*s*âkhya itself, where a short
syllable, though occupying a place which would seem to require
lengthening, remains short, there are many others which the
Prâti*s*âkhya does not mention, because, from its point of view, there
was no necessity for doing so. The Prâti*s*âkhya has been blamed <span
id="fr_55"></span>[a](#fn_46.md) for omitting such cases as I, 93, 6,
uru*m* ya*gñ*âya *k*akrathŭr u lokam; or I, 96, 1, devâ agnim dhârayan
drăvi*n*odâm. But though occupying the eighth place, and though followed
by a short syllable, these syllables could never fall under the general
observation of the Prâti*s*âkhya, because that general observation
refers to final vowels only, but not to short syllables in general.
Similar cases are I, 107, 1<sup>a</sup>; 122, 9; 130, 10; 152, 6; 154,
1; 158, 5<sup>a</sup>; 163, 2; 167, 10<sup>a</sup>; 171, 4; 173, 6; 179,
1<sup>a</sup>; 182, 8<sup>a</sup>; 186, 6, &c.

If, therefore, we say that, happen what may, these metrical rules must
be observed, and the text of the Veda altered in order to satisfy the
requirements of these rules, we ought to know at all events that we do
this on our own responsibility, and that we cannot shield ourselves
behind the authority of *S*aunaka or Kâtyâyana. Now it is well known
that Professor Kuhn <span id="fr_56"></span>[b](#fn_47.md) has laid down
the rule that the Traish*t*ubha pâdas must end in a bacchius or
amphibrachys  ̆  ̄  ̄̆, and the *G*âgata pâdas in a dijambus or pæon
secundus  ̆  ̄  ̆  ̄̆. With regard to Ânush*t*ubha pâdas, he requires the
dijambus or pæon secundus  ̆  ̄  ̆  ̄̆ at the end of a whole verse only,
allowing greater freedom in the formation of the preceding pâdas. In a
later article,

<span id="page_xcv">p. xcv</span>

however, the final pâda, too, in Ânush*t*ubha metre is allowed greater
freedom, and the rule, as above given, is strictly maintained with
regard to the Traish*t*ubha and *G*âgata pâdas only.
