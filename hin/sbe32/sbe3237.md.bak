### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 55.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 17-18.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. The chasing [1](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:1:1.md) Maruts with gleaming
spears, the golden-breasted, have gained great strength, they move along
on quick well-broken horses;—when they went in triumph, the chariots
followed.

2\. You have yourselves, you know, acquired power; you shine bright and
wide, you great ones. They have even measured the sky with their
strength;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.

3\. The strong heroes, born together, and nourished together, have
further grown to real beauty. They shine brilliantly like the rays of
the sun;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.

4\. Your greatness, O Maruts, is to be honoured, it is to be yearned for
like the sight of the sun. Place us also in immortality;—when they went
in triumph, the chariots followed.

5\. O Maruts you raise [1](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:5:1.md) the rain from the
sea, and rain it down, O yeomen [2](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:5:2.md)! Your
milch-cows, O destroyers [3](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:5:3.md), are never
destroyed;—when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.

6\. When you have joined the deer as horses [1](sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:6:1.md)
to the shafts, and have clothed yourselves in golden garments, then, O
Maruts, you scatter all enemies;—when they went in triumph, the chariots
followed.

7\. Not mountains, not rivers have kept you back, wherever you see, O
Maruts, there you go. You

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

go even round heaven and earth;—when they went in triumph, the chariots
followed.

8\. Be it old, O Maruts, or be it new, be it spoken, O Vasus, or be it
recited, you take cognisance of it all;—when they went in triumph, the
chariots followed.

9\. Have mercy on us, O Maruts, do not strike us, extend to us your
manifold protection. Do remember the praise, the friendship;—when they
went in triumph, the chariots followed.

10\. Lead us, O Maruts, towards greater wealth, and out of tribulations,
when you have been praised. O worshipful Maruts, accept our offering,
and let us be lords of treasures!

#### NOTES.

The same poet, *S*yâvâ*s*va Âtreya. Metre, 1-9 *G*agatî; 10 Trish*t*ubh.
None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV. Verse 5 is found in TS. II,
4, 8, 2; MS. II, 4, 7. The refrain probably means that when the Maruts
march in triumph, the chariots of their army, or the chariots of other
gods, follow. The latter view is taken by Sâya*n*a, TS. II, 4, 8, 2.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:55:1:1">1</span>. Práya*g*yu, generally explained by
rushing forward, but in that sense hardly to be derived from ya*g*, to
sacrifice, may stand for an old Vedic form prayakshyu, changed into
praya*g*yu by priests who had forgotten the root yaksh, and thought of
nothing but sacrifices. This root yaksh has been identified by Grassmann
with OHG. jagôn (venari, persequi), originally to rush after, to hunt,
to try to injure or kill (cf. m*ri*ga*n*yáva*h*, X, 40, 4). This would
explain most derivations from yaksh, not excepting the later Yakshas,
and . would yield an excellent sense for prayakshyu, as an epithet of
the Maruts. Sec note to VII, 56, 16. Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, p. 98, is
satisfied with deriving praya*g*yu and p*ri*sh*th*apraya*g* from the
root ya*g*, to sacrifice, and translates it by sacrificing, but in the
sense of causing sacrifices to be offered.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:55:5:1">1</span>. The verb îrayatha is transitive;
see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 54, and compare AV. IV, 27, 4. apá*h*
samudrâ´d dívam úd vahanti.

Note <span id="an_5:55:5:2">2</span>. I have translated purîshi*n*a*h*
by yeomen, in the sense of cultivators of the land. I have followed
Roth, who shows that purîsha means soil, and that purîshin is used for
an occupier of the soil, a landlord. See K. Z. XXVI, p. 65.

Note <span id="an_5:55:5:3">3</span>. Dasra, powerful, a common epithet
of the A*s*vins, seems here, when joined with dasyanti, to retain
something

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

of its etymological meaning, which comes out clearly in dâs, to attack,
unless it is derived from da*m*s.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_5:55:6:1">1</span>. I prefer to translate here 'the
deer as horses,' not 'the speckled horses.' See, however, II, 34, 4, and
Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 226.
