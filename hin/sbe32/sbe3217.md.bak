### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 19.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 36-37.

#### <span class="smallcaps">.</span>

1\. Thou art called forth to this fair sacrifice for a draught of milk
[1](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:1:1.md); with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!

2\. No god indeed, no mortal, is beyond the might
[1](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:2:1.md) of thee, the mighty one; with the Maruts
come hither, O Agni!

3\. They who know of the great sky [1](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:3:1.md), the
Vi*s*ve Devas [2](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:3:2.md) without guile
[3](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:3:3.md); with those Maruts come hither, O Agni!

4\. The strong ones who sing their song [1](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:4:1.md),
unconquerable by force; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!

5\. They who are brilliant, of terrible designs, powerful, and devourers
of foes; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!

6\. They who in heaven are enthroned as gods, in the light of the
firmament [1](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:6:1.md); with the Maruts come hither, O
Agni!

7\. They who toss the clouds [1](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:7:1.md) across the
surging sea [2](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:7:2.md); with the Maruts come hither, O
Agni!

8\. They who shoot with their darts (lightnings) across the sea with
might; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!

9\. I pour out to thee for the early draught[1](sbe3217.htm#an_1:19:9:1.md)
the sweet (juice) of Soma; with the Maruts come hither, O Agni!

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

#### NOTES.

This hymn is ascribed to Medhâtithi, of the family of Ka*n*va. Verse I =
SV I, 16.

##### Verse 1.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Earnestly art thou invoked to
this perfect rite, to drink the Soma juice; come, Agni, with the Maruts.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Zu diesem schonen Opfer wirst du
gerufen, zum Trank der Milch!—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Her zu diesem schönen opfer,
gerufen wirst zum milchtrank du, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.

Note <span id="an_1:19:1:1">1</span>. Gopîthá is explained by Yâska and
Sâya*n*a as drinking of Soma. I have kept to the literal signification
of the word, a draught of milk. In the last verse of our hymn the
libation offered to Agni and the Maruts is said to consist of Soma, but
Soma was commonly mixed with milk. The other meaning assigned to
gopîthá, protection, would give the sense: 'Thou art called for the sake
of protection.' But pîtha has clearly the sense of drinking in
soma-pîthá, RV. I, 51, 7, and may therefore be taken in the same sense
in gopîthá.

##### Verse 2.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: No god nor man has power over a
rite (dedicated) to thee, who art mighty: come, Agni, with the Maruts.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Denn nicht ein Gott, kein
Sterblicher ragt über dein, des Grossen, Macht—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni!
komm!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Es überragt kein gott, kein
sterblicher die einsicht dein des grossen, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.

Note <span id="an_1:19:2:1">1</span>. The Sanskrit krátu expresses power
both of body and mind. Para*h* governs the accusative.

##### Verse 3.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Who all are divine, and devoid of
malignity.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

and who know (how to cause the descent) of great waters: come, Agni,
with the Maruts.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Die guten Götter, welche all
bestehen in dem weiten Raum—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Die wissen um den grossen raum,
alle götter truges bar, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.

Note <span id="an_1:19:3:1">1</span>. The sky or welkin (rá*g*as) is the
proper abode of the Maruts, and 'they who know of' means simply 'they
who dwell' in the great sky. The Vedic poets distinguish commonly
between the three worlds, the earth, p*ri*thivî´, f., or pâ´rthiva, n.;
the sky, rá*g*as; and the heaven, dyú: see I, 6, 9, note 1. The phrase
mahá*h* rá*g*asa*h* occurs I, 6, 10; 168, 6, &c. Sâya*n*a takes rá*g*as
for water or rain: see on this my article in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol.
xii, p. 28. In some passages rá*g*as means 'darkness,' and might be
identified with the Greek Ἔρεβος; Ath. Veda VIII, 2, 1. pâráyâmi tvâ
rá*g*asa út tvâ m*ri*tyór apîparam, 'I bring thee out of darkness, out
of death I brought thee.' The identification of rá*g*as with ἔρεβος (Leo
Meyer, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. vi, p. 19) must however remain
doubtful, until stronger evidence has been brought forward in support of
a Greek β representing a Sanskrit *g*, even in the middle of a word. See
my article in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xv, p. 215; Curtius. Grundzüge
(fifth edition), p. 480.

Note <span id="an_1:19:3:2">2</span>. The appellation Ví*s*ve devâ´*h*,
all gods together, or, more properly, host-gods, is often applied to the
Maruts; cf. I, 23, 8; 10. Benfey connects this line with the preceding
verse, considering Ví*s*ve devâ´*h*, it seems, inappropriate as an
epithet of the Maruts.

Note <span id="an_1:19:3:3">3</span>. On adrúh, without guile or deceit,
without hatred, see Kuhn's excellent article, Zeitschrift für die
Vergleichende Sprachforschung, vol. i, pp. 179, 193. Adrúh is applied to
the Maruts again in VIII, 46, 4, though in connection with other gods.
It is applied to the Vi*s*ve Devas, RV. I, 3, 9; IX, 102, 5: the
Âdityas, RV. VIII, 19, 34; 67, 13: the Rudras, RV. IX, 73, 7: to Heaven
and Earth, RV. II, 41, 21; III, 56, 1; IV, 56, 2; VII, 66, 18: to Mitra
and Varu*n*a, RV. V, 68, 4: to Agni, RV. VI, 15, 7; VIII, 44, 10. The
form adhrúk occurs in the sixth Ma*nd*ala only.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

##### Verse 4.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Who are fierce, and send down
rain, and are unsurpassed in strength: come, Agni, with the Maruts.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Die schrecklich-unbesiegbaren,
die mächtiglich Licht angefacht—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Die singen, die gewaltigen, ihr
lied unangegriffen durch (ihre) kraft, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.

Note <span id="an_1:19:4:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a explains arká by water.
Hence Wilson: 'Who are fierce and send down rain.' But arká has only
received this meaning of water in the artificial system of
interpretation first started by the authors of the Brâhma*n*as, who had
lost all knowledge of the natural sense of the ancient hymns. The
passages in which arká is explained as water in the Brâhma*n*as are
quoted by Sâya*n*a, but they require no refutation. On the singing of
the Maruts, see note to I, 38, 15; also Bergaigne, Journ. As. 1884, p.
194. The perfect in the Veda, like the perfect in Homer, has frequently
to be rendered in English by the present.

##### Verse 5.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Who are brilliant, of terrific
forms, who are possessors of great wealth, and are devourers of the
malevolent: come, Agni, with the Maruts.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Die glänzend-grau’ngestaltigen,
hochherrschend feindvernichtenden—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Die glanzvollen, von
schrecklicher gestalt, von grosser herschaft, feindverzerer, mit den
Marut, Agni, kom.

##### Verse 6.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Who are divinities abiding in the
radiant heaven above the sun: come, Agni, with the Maruts.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Die Götter die im Himmel sind ob
dem Lichtkreis des Göttersitz’s—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Die ob der himmeiswölbung glanz,
am himel die götter sitzen, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.

Note <span id="an_1:19:6:1">1</span>. Nâ´ka must be translated by
firmament, as there

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

is no other word in English besides heaven, and that is wanted to render
dyú. Like the Jewish firmament, the Indian nâ´ka, too, is adorned with
stars; cf. I, 68, 10. pipé*s*a nâ´kam st*rí*bhi*h*. Dyú, heaven, is
supposed to be above the rá*g*as, sky or welkin. Kuhn's Zeitschrift,
vol. xii, p. z8.

Sâya*n*a: 'In the radiant heaven above the sun.' See note 1 to I, 6, 9;
p. 49.

##### Verse 7.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Who scatter the clouds, and
agitate the sea (with waves): come, Agni, with the Maruts.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Welche über das wogende Meer
hinjagen die Wolkenschaar—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Die die berge wiegend hindurch
durchs wogenmeer bewegen, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.

Note <span id="an_1:19:7:1">1</span>. That párvata (mountain) is used in
the sense of cloud, without any further explanation, is clear from many
passages:

I, 57, 6. tvám tám indra párvatam mahâ´m urúm vá*g*re*n*a va*g*rin
parva-*s*á*h* *k*akartitha.

Thou, Indra, hast cut this great broad cloud to pieces with thy
lightning. Cf. I, 85, 10.

We actually find two similes mixed up together, such as V, 32, 2.
û´dha*h* párvatasya, the udder of the cloud. All we can do is to
translate párvata by mountain, but always to remember that mountain
means cloud. In the Edda, too, the rocks, said to have been fashioned
out of Ymir's bones, are supposed to be intended for clouds. In Old
Norse klakkr means both cloud and rock; nay, the English word cloud
itself has been identified with the Anglo-Saxon clûd, rock. See Justi,
Orient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 62. See Grimm, Deutsche Grammatik, 13,
398, 424; also Kuhn, Weisse Frau, p. 12.

Note <span id="an_1:19:7:2">2</span>. Whether the surging sea is to be
taken for the sea or for the air, depends on the view which we take of
the earliest cosmography of the Vedic *Ri*shis. Sâya*n*a explains: 'They
who make the clouds to go, and stir the

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

watery sea.' Wilson remarks that the influence of the winds upon the
sea, alluded to in this and the following verse, indicates more
familiarity with the ocean than we should have expected from the
traditional inland position of the early Hindus, and it has therefore
been supposed by others that, even in passages like our own, samudrá was
meant for the sky, the waters above the firmament. But although there
are passages in the Rig-veda where samudrá must be taken to mean the
welkin (RV. I, 95, 3. samudrá ékam diví ékam ap-sú), this word shows in
by far the larger number of passages the clear meaning of ocean. There
is one famous passage, VII, 95, 2, which proves that the Vedic poets,
who were supposed to have known the upper courses only of the rivers of
the Penjâb, had followed the greatest and most sacred of their rivers,
the Sarasvatî, as far as the Indian ocean. It is well known that, as
early as the composition of the laws of the Mânavas, and possibly as
early as the composition of the Sûtras on which these metrical laws are
based, the river Sarasvatî had changed its course, and that the place
where that river disappeared under ground was called Vina*s*ana <span
id="fr_96"></span>[a](#fn_87.md), the loss. This Vina*s*ana forms,
according to the laws of the Mânavas, the western frontier of
Madhyade*s*a, the eastern frontier being formed by the confluence of the
Gangâ and Yamunâ. Madhyade*s*a is a section of Âryâvarta, the abode of
the Âryas in the widest sense. Âryâvarta shares with Madhyade*s*a the
same frontiers in the north and the south, viz. the Himalaya and Vindhya
mountains, but it extends beyond Madhyade*s*a to the west and east as
far as the western and eastern seas. A section of Madhyade*s*a, again,
is the country described as that of the Brahmarshis, which comprises
only Kurukshetra, the countries of the Matsyas, Pa*ñk*âlas
(Kânyakub*g*a, according to Kullûka), and *S*ûrasenas (Mathurâ,
according to Kullûka). The most sacred spot of all, however, is that
section of the Brahmarshi country which lies between the rivers
D*ri*shadvatî and Sarasvatî, and which in the laws of

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

the Mânavas is called Brahmâvarta. In the Sûtras which supplied the
material to the authors of the metrical law-books, the Vina*s*ana is
mentioned for the first time in the Baudhâyana Sûtras, I, 2, 9,
'Âryâvarta lies to the east of the region where (the Sarasvatî)
disappears, to the west of the Black-forest, to the north of the
Pâripâtra (mountains), to the south of the Himalaya.' The name of the
Sarasvatî is not mentioned, but no other river can be understood. What
is curious, however, is, that in the Vasish*th*a Sûtras where the same
frontiers of Âryâvarta are given (I, 8), the MSS. read originally prâg
âdar*s*ât, i. e. east of the Âdar*s*a mountains, which was afterwards
changed into prâg adar*s*anât, and interpreted 'east of the
invisibility, or of the disappearance of the Sarasvatî.' Vasish*th*a
quotes another authority, a Gâthâ of the Bhâllavins, which says: 'In the
west the boundary river,' i. e. sindhur vidhâra*n*î. This sindhur
vidhâra*n*î is another name of the old Sarasvatî, and in Baudhâyana I,
2, 12, the same verse is quoted, though the reading of vidhâra*n*î
varies with vi*k*ara*n*î and visara*n*î. See Bühler, l. c. Madhyade*s*a
is mentioned in one of the Pari*s*ish*t*as (MS. 510, Wilson) as a kind
of model country, but it is there described as lying east of
Da*s*âr*n*a <span id="fr_97"></span>[a](#fn_88.md), west of Kâmpilya <span
id="fr_98"></span>[b](#fn_89.md), north of Pâriyâtra <span
id="fr_99"></span>[c](#fn_90.md), and south of the Himavat, or again, in a
more general way, as the Duâb of the Gangâ and Yamunâ <span
id="fr_100"></span>[d](#fn_91.md).

It is very curious that while in the later Sanskrit literature

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

the disappearance of the Sarasvatî in the desert is a fact familiar to
every writer, no mention of it should occur during the whole of the
Vedic period, and it is still more curious that in one of the hymns of
the Rig-veda we should have a distinct statement that the Sarasvatî fell
into the sea:

VII, 95, 1-2. prá kshódasâ dhâ´yasâ sasre eshâ´ sárasvatî dharú*n*am
â´yasî pû´*h*, pra-bâ´badhânâ rathyẫ-iva yâti ví*s*vâ*h* apá*h* mahinâ´
síndhu*h* anyâ´*h*. ékâ a*k*etat sárasvatî nadî´nâm *s*ú*k*i*h* yatî´
girí-bhya*h* â´ samudrâ´t, râyá*h* *k*étantî bhúvanasya bhû´re*h*
gh*ri*tám páya*h* duduhe nâ´hushâya.

1\. 'With her fertilising stream this Sarasvatî comes forth—(she is to
us) a stronghold, an iron gate. Moving along as on a chariot, this river
surpasses in greatness all other waters. 2. Alone among all rivers
Sarasvatî listened, she who goes pure from the mountains as far as the
sea. She who knows of the manifold wealth of the world, has poured out
to man her fat milk.'

Here we see samudrá used clearly in the sense of sea, the Indian sea,
and we have at the same time a new indication of the distance which
separates the Vedic age from that of the later Sanskrit literature.
Though it may not be possible to determine by geological evidence the
time of the changes which. modified the southern area of the Penjâb and
caused the Sarasvatî to disappear in the desert, still the fact remains
that the loss of the Sarasvatî is later than the Vedic age, and that at
that time the waters of the Sarasvatî reached the sea. Professor Wilson
had observed long ago in reference to the rivers of that part of India,
that there have been, no doubt, considerable changes here, both in the
nomenclature and in the courses of the rivers, and this remark has been
fully confirmed by later observations. I believe it can be proved that
in the Vedic age the Sarasvatî was a river as large as the Sutlej, that
it was the last of the rivers of the Penjâb, and therefore the iron
gate, or the real frontier against the rest of India. At present the
Sarasvatî is so small a river that the epithets applied to the Sarasvatî
in the Veda have become quite inapplicable to it. The Vedic *Ri*shis,
though acquainted with numerous rivers, including

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

the Indus and Ganges, call the Sarasvatî the mother of rivers (VII, 36,
6. sárasvatî saptáthî síndhu-mâtâ), the strongest of rivers (VI, 61, 13.
apásâm apá*h*-tamâ), and in our passage, VII, 95, 2, we have, as far as
I can judge, conclusive evidence that the old Sarasvatî reached in its
course the Indian sea, either by itself, or united with the Indus <span
id="fr_101"></span>[a](#fn_92.md).

But this passage, though important as showing the application of
samudrá, i. e. confluvies, to the Indian sea, and proving the
acquaintance of the Vedic *Ri*shis with the southern coast of India, is
by no means the only one in which samudrá must be translated by sea.
Thus we read, VII, 49, 2:

yâ´*h* â´pa*h* divyâ´*h* utá vâ srávanti khanítrimâ*h* utá vâ yâ´*h*
svayam-gâ´*h*, samudrá-arthâ*h* yâ´*h* *s*ú*k*aya*h* pâvakâ´*h* tâ´*h*
â´pa*h* devî´*h* ihá mâ´m avantu.

The waters which are from heaven, or those which flow after being dug,
or those which spring up by themselves, the bright, pure waters that
tend to the sea, may those divine waters protect me here!

I, 71, 7. agním ví*s*vâ*h* abhí p*rí*ksha*h* sa*k*ante samudrám ná
sraváta*h* saptá yahvî´*h*.

All kinds of food go to Agni, as the seven rivers go to the sea.

Cf. I, 190, 7. samudrám ná sraváta*h* ródha-*k*akrâ*h*.

V, 78, 8. yáthâ vâ´ta*h* yáthâ vánam yáthâ samudrá*h* é*g*ati.

As the wind moves, as the forest moves, as the sea moves (or the sky).

In hymn X, 58, the same expression occurs which we have in our hymn, and
samudrám ar*n*avám there as here admits but of one explanation, the
surging sea.

Samudrá in many passages of the Rig-veda has to be taken as an
adjective, in the sense of watery or flowing:

VI, 58, 3. yâ´s te pûshan nâ´va*h* antá*h* samudré hira*n*yáyî*h*
antárikshe *k*áranti.

Thy golden ships, O Pûshan, which move within the watery sky.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

VII, 70, 2. yá*h* vâm samudrâ´n saríta*h* píparti.

He who carries you across the watery rivers.

I, 161, 14. at-bhí*h* yâti váru*n*a*h* samudraí*h*.

Varu*n*a moves in the flowing waters.

In both these passages samudrá, as an adjective, does not conform to the
gender of the noun. See Bollensen, Orient und Occident, vol. ii, p. 467.

II, 16, 3. ná samudraí*h* párvatai*h* indra te rátha*h* (ná pari-bhvẽ).

Thy chariot, O Indra, is not to be overcome by the watery clouds.

##### Verse 8.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Who spread (through the
firmament), along with the rays (of the sun), and, with their strength,
agitate the ocean: come, Agni, with the Maruts.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Die mit Blitzen schleuderen
machtig über das Meer hinaus—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Die mit stralen ihre richtung
nemen mit gewalt durchs mer, mit den Marut, Agni, kom.

##### Verse 9.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: I pour out the sweet Soma juice
for thy drinking, (as) of old: come, Agni, with the Maruts.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Ich giesse zu dem ersten Trank
für dich des Soma Honig aus—Mit diesen Marut’s, Agni! komm!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Ich giesze dir zum ersten trunk
madhu mit dem soma zu; mit den Marut, Agni, kom.

Note <span id="an_1:19:9:1">1</span>. Pûrvapîti, the early draught,
implies at the same time the priority of the god to whom it is given.
