### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 37.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 12-14.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-Gods)</span>.

1\. Sing forth, O Ka*n*vas, to the sportive host of your Maruts,
brilliant on their chariots, and unscathed
[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:1:1.md),—

2\. They who were born together, self-luminous, with the spotted deer
(the clouds) [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:2:1.md), the spears, the daggers, the
glittering ornaments [2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:2:2.md).

3\. I hear their [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:3:1.md) whips, almost close by,
when they crack them in their hands; they gain splendour
[2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:3:2) on their way [3](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:3:3.md).

4\. Sing forth the god-given prayer to the wild
[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:4:1.md) host of your Maruts, endowed with terrible
vigour [2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:4:2.md) and strength.

5\. Celebrate the bull among the cows (the storm among the clouds)
[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:5:1.md), for it is the sportive host of the Maruts;
he grew as he tasted the rain [2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:5:2.md).

6\. Who, O ye men, is the strongest among you here, ye shakers of heaven
and earth, when you shake them like the hem of a garment
[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:6:1.md)?

7\. At your approach the son of man holds himself down; the gnarled
cloud [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:7:1.md) fled at your fierce anger.

8\. They at whose racings [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:8:1.md) the earth, like a
hoary king, trembles for fear on their ways,

9\. Their birth is strong indeed: there is strength to come forth from
their mother, nay, there is vigour twice enough for it
[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:9:1.md).

10\. And these sons, the singers [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:10:1.md),
stretched out the fences in their racings [2](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:10:2.md);
the cows had to walk knee-deep.

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

11\. They cause this long and broad unceasing rain
[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:11:1.md) to fall on their ways.

12\. O Maruts, with such strength as yours, you have caused men to
tremble [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:12:1.md), you have caused the mountains to
tremble.

13\. As the Maruts pass [1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:13:1.md) along, they talk
together on the way: does any one hear them?

14\. Come fast on your quick steeds! there are worshippers
[1](sbe3218.htm#an_1:37:14:1.md) for you among the Ka*n*vas: may you well
rejoice among them.

15\. Truly there is enough for your rejoicing. We always are their
servants, that we may live even the whole of life.

#### NOTES.

This hymn is ascribed to Ka*n*va, the son of Ghora.

Verse 1 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 6.

Verse 3 = SV. I, 135.

Verse 10 = SV. I, 221.

##### Verse 1.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Celebrate, Ka*n*vas, the
aggregate strength of the Maruts, sportive, without horses, but shining
in their car.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Ka*n*viden, auf! begrüsst mit
Sang, die muntre Heerschaar der Marut’s, die rasch’ste, wagenglänzende.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Eurer spilenden schar, der
Marutschar, der unangreifbaren, die auf wagen glänzt, der singt, o
Ka*n*vâs, zu.

Note <span id="an_1:37:1:1">1</span>. Wilson translates anarvâ´*n*am by
without horses, though the commentator distinctly explains the word by
without an enemy. A Brâhma*n*a passage explains: bhrât*ri*vyo vâ arvâ,
ity *s*rutyantarât. See TS. IV, 3, 13, 6. Wilson considers it doubtful
whether árvan can ever mean enemy. The fact is, that in the Rig-veda
an-arván never means without horses, but always without hurt or free
from enemies; and the commentator is perfectly right, as far as the
sense is concerned, in rendering the word by without an enemy, or
unopposed (apraty-*ri*ta). An-arván is not formed from árvat, horse,
racer, but from árvan; and this is derived from the same root which
yields árus, n. a wound, *ri*ti (see I, 64, 15, note), &c. The
accusative of anarvat, without a horse, would be anarvantam, not
anarvâ*n*am.

The root ar, in the sense of hurting, is distantly connected with the
root mar: see Lectures on the Science of Language, Second Series, p.
323. It exists in the Greek ὄλλυμι corresponding to Sanskrit *rin*omi,
i. e. ar*n*omi, I hurt, likewise

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

in οὐλή, wound, which cannot be derived from ὅλη; in οὖλος, οὔλιος,
hurtful, and ὀλοός, destructive: see Curtius, Grundzüge der Griechischen
Etymologie (fünfte Ausgabe), p. 372. In the Veda ar has the sense of
offending or injuring, particularly if preceded by upa.

X, 164, 3. yát â-*s*ásâ ni*h*-*s*ásâ abhi-*s*ásâ upa-ârimá *g*â´grata*h*
yát svapánta*h*, agní*h* ví*s*vâni ápa du*h*-k*ri*tâ´ni á*g*ush*t*âni
âré asmát dadhâtu.

If we have offended, or whatever fault we have committed, by bidding,
blaming, or forbidding, while waking or while sleeping, may Agni remove
all wicked misdeeds far from us.

Hence upârá, injury, VII, 86, 6. ásti *g*yâ´yân kánîyasa*h* upa-aré, the
older man is there to injure, to offend, to mislead, the young: (History
of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, second edition, p. 541.) Roth translates
upârá by Verfehlung, missing. Ari, enemy, too, is best derived from this
root, and not from râ, to give, with the negative particle, as if
meaning originally, as Sâya*n*a supposes, a man who does not give. In
árarivân, gen. árarusha*h*, hostile, Rosen recognised many years ago a
participle of a really reduplicated perfect of ar, and he likewise
traced aráru, enemy, back to the same root: see his note to I, 18, 3.

From this root ar, to hurt, árvan, hurting, as well as árus, wound, are
derived in the same manner as both dhánvan and dhánus, bow, are formed
from dhan; yá*g*van and yá*g*us from ya*g*, párvan and párus from par.
See Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 233.

Anarván, then, is the same as ánarus, *S*at. P. Brâhma*n*a III, 1, 3, 7;
and from meaning originally without a wound or without one who can
wound, it takes the more general sense of uninjured, invulnerable,
perfect, strong, (cf. integer, intact, and entire.) This meaning is
applicable to I, 94, 2; 136, 5; II, 6, 5; V, 49, 4; VII, 20, 3; 97, 5;
X, 61, 13; 65, 3. In I, 116, 16, anarván seems to be used as an adverb;
in I, 51, 12, as applied to *s*lóka, it may have the more general
meaning of irresistible, powerful.

There are two passages in which the nom. sing. árvân, and one in which
the acc. sing. árvâ*n*am, occur, apparently

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

meaning horse. But in I, 163, 13, and IX, 97, 25, árvân stands in the
Pada text only, the Sa*m*hitâ has árvâ̐ á*kkh*a and árvâ̐ iva. In X, 46,
5, the text híri-*s*ma*s*rum ná árvâ*n*am dhána-ar*k*am is too doubtful
to allow of any safe induction, particularly as the Sâma-veda gives a
totally different reading. I do not think, therefore, that árvat, horse,
admits in the nom. and acc. sing. of any forms but árvâ and
árvantam <span id="fr_102"></span>[a](#fn_93). Pâ*n*ini (VI, 4, 127.md)
allows the forms arvân and arvâ*n*am, but in anarvan only, which, as we
saw, has nothing in common with árvat, horse. Benfey: 'die rascheste
(keinen Renner habend, uneinholbar),' the quickest (having no racer,
hence not to be reached). M. Bergaigne (Journ. As. 1884, p. 188) tries
to defend anarvan in the sense of ana*s*va, without considering the
grammatical objections. In VI, 66, 7 (not I, 6, 7) ana*s*vá*h* does not
refer to yâma*h*.

The masculine anarvâ´*n*am after the neuter *s*árdhas is curious;
*s*árdhas means might, but it is here used to express a might or an
aggregate of strong men or gods, and the nom. plur. yé, who, in the next
verse, shows the same transition of thought, not only from the singular
to the plural, but also from the neuter to the masculine, which must be
admitted in anarvâ´*n*am <span id="fr_103"></span>[b](#fn_94.md). It would
be possible, if necessary, to explain away the irregularity of
anarvâ´*n*am by admitting a rapid transition from the Maruts to Indra,
the eldest among the Maruts (cf. I, 23, 8. índra gyesh*th*â*h*
márut-ga*n*â*h*), and it would be easier still to alter *s*árdhas into
*s*ârdham, as an accusative singular of the masculine noun *s*árdha,
which has the same meaning as the neuter *s*árdhas. There is one
passage, V, 56, 9, which would seem to give ample countenance to such a
conjecture:

tám va*h* *s*árdham rathe-*s*úbham—â´ huve.

I call hither this your host, brilliant on chariots.

Again, II, 30, u, we read:

tám va*h* *s*árdham mâ´rutam—girâ´ úpa bruve.

I call with my voice on this your host of Maruts.

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

VIII, 93, 16. *s*rutám va*h* v*ri*trahán-tamam prá *s*árdham
*k*arsha*n*înâ´m, â´ *s*ushe.

I pant for the glorious, victorious, host of the quick Maruts.

From this *s*árdha we have also the genitive *s*árdhasya, VII, 56, 8
(4):

*s*ubhrá*h* va*h* *s*úshma*h* krúdhmî mánâ*m*si dhúni*h* múni*h*iva
*s*árdhasya dh*ri*sh*n*ó*h*.

Your prowess is brilliant, your minds furious; the shout of the daring
host is like one possessed.

We have likewise the dative *s*árdhâya, the instrumental *s*árdhena, and
the acc. plur. *s*árdhân; and in most cases, except in two or three
where *s*árdha seems to be used as an adjective, meaning strong, these
words are applied to the host of the Maruts.

But the other word *s*árdhas is equally well authenticated, and we find
of it, not only the nominative, accusative, and vocative sing.
*s*árdhas, but likewise the nom. plur. *s*árdhâ*m*si.

The nominative singular occurs in our very hymn:

I, 37, 5. kri*l*ám yát *s*árdha*h* mâ´rutam.

Which is the sportive host of the Maruts.

I, 127, 6. sá*h* hí *s*árdha*h* ná mâ´rutam tuvi-sváni*h*.

For he (Agni) is strong-voiced like the host of the Maruts.

IV, 6, 10. tuvi-svanása*h* mâ´rutam ná *s*árdha*h*.

Thy flames (Agni) are strong-voiced like the host of the Maruts.

V, 46, 5. utá tyát na*h* mâ´rutam *s*árdha*h* â´ gamat.

May also that host of the Maruts come to us.

II, 1, 5. tvám narâ´m *s*árdha*h* asi puru-vásu*h*.

Thou (Agni), full of riches, art the host of the men.

This host of men seems to me intended again for the Maruts, although it
is true that in thus identifying Agni with different gods, the poet
repeats himself in the next verse:

II, 1, 6. tvám sárdha*h* mâ´rutam.

Thou art the host of the Maruts.

If this repetition seems offensive, the first narâ´m *s*árdhas might be
taken for some other company of gods. Thus we find:

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

VII, 44, 5. *sri*nótu na*h* daívyam *s*árdha*h* agní*h* i s*rin*vántu
ví*s*ve mahishâ´*h* ámûrâ*h*.

May the divine host, may Agni, hear us, may the Vi*s*ve hear us, the
strong, the wise.

Or III, 19, 4. sá*h* â´ vaha devâ-tâtim yavish*th*a *s*árdha*h* yát adyá
divyám yá*g*âsi.

Bring thou hither, O Agni, the gods, that you may sacrifice to-day to
the divine host.

Or I, 139, 1. â´ nú tát *s*árdha*h* divyám v*rin*îmahe.

We chose for us now that divine host.

As in these last, so in many other passages, *s*árdhas is used as a
neuter in the accusative. For instance,

I, 106, 1; II, 11, 14. mâ´rutam sárdha*h*.

II, 3, 3; VI, 3, 8. *s*árdha*h* marútâm.

The vocative occurs,

V, 46, 2. ágne índra váru*n*a mítra dévâ*h* *s*árdha*h* prâ yanta
mâ´ruta utá vish*n*o (íti).

Agni, Indra, Varu*n*a, Mitra, gods, host of the Maruts, come forth, and
Vish*n*u!

We see how throughout all these passages those in which *s*árdha and
*s*árdhas are applied to the Maruts, or to some other company of gods,
preponderate most decidedly. Yet passages occur in the Rig-veda where
both *s*árdha, and *s*árdhas are applied to other hosts or companies.
Thus V, 53, 10, *s*árdha refers to chariots, while in I, 133, 3, sárdhas
is applied to evil spirits.

If the passages hitherto examined were all that occur in the Rig-veda,
we might still feel startled at the construction of our verse, where
*s*árdhas is not only followed by masculine adjectives in the singular,
but, in the next verse, by a pronoun in the plural. But if we take the
last irregularity first, we find the same construction, viz. sárdhas
followed by yé, in III, 32, 4:

índrasya *s*árdha*h* marúta*h* yé â´san.

The host of Indra, that was the Maruts.

As to the change of genders, we find adjectives in the masculine after
*s*árdhas, in

V, 52, 8. sárdha*h* mâ´rutam út sa*m*sa satyâ-*s*avasam *rí*bhvasam.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

Celebrate the host of the Maruts, the truly vigorous, the brilliant.

Here, too, the poet afterwards continues in the plural, though as he
uses the demonstrative, and not, as in our passage, the relative
pronoun, we cannot quote this in support of the irregularity which has
here to be explained. Anyhow the construction of our verse, though bold
and unusual, is not so unusual as to force us to adopt conjectural
remedies. In V, 58, 2, we find yé after ga*n*á*h*. On the Umbrian Çerfo
Martio, as possibly the same as *s*árdha-s mâ´ruta-s, see Grassman,
Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 190. The Zend *s*aredha, kind, species,
is the same word.

##### Verse 2.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Who, borne by spotted deer, were
born self-radiant, with weapons, war-cries, and decorations.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Die mit Hirschen and Speeren
gleich mit Donnern and mit Blitzen auch—selbststrahlende—geboren sind.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Die mit vilfarbigen speeren, mit
der schwerter glanze, sichtbar wurden mit eignem leuchten.

Note <span id="an_1:37:2:1">1</span>. The spotted deer (p*rí*shatî) are
the recognised animals of the Maruts, and were originally, as it would
seem, intended for the rain-clouds. Sâya*n*a is perfectly aware of the
original meaning of p*rí*shatî, as clouds. The legendary school, he
says, takes them for deer with white spots, the etymological school for
many-coloured lines of clouds: (RV. BH. I, 64, 8.) This passage shows
that although p*rí*shatî, as Roth observes, may mean a spotted cow or a
spotted horse,—the Maruts, in fact, are called sometimes
p*ri*shat-a*s*vâ*h*, having piebald horses, or, having p*ri*shats for
their horses, VII, 40, 3,—yet the later tradition in India had
distinctly declared in favour of spotted deer. The Vedic poets, however,
admitted both ideas, and they speak in the same hymn, nay, in the same
verse, of the fallow deer and of the horses of the Maruts. Thus V, 58,
1, the Maruts are called â*s*ú-a*s*vâ*h*, possessed of quick horses; and
in V, 58, 6, we read yát prá áyâsish*t*a p*rí*shatîbhi*h*
á*s*vai*h*—ráthebhi*h*, where the gender of p*rí*shatîbhi*h*

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

would hardly allow us to join it with ásvai*h*, but where we must
translate: When you come with the deer, the horses, the chariots, or
with your deer, as horses. Ludwig joins p*ri*shatîbhi*h* with
*ri*sh*t*ibhi*h*, and again in I, 64, 8; see note i to I, 87, 4.

Note <span id="an_1:37:2:2">2</span>. The spears and daggers of the
Maruts are meant for the thunderbolts, and the glittering ornaments for
the lightning. Sâya*n*a takes vâ´*s*î in this passage for war-cries on
the authority of the Nirukta, where vâ´*s*î is given among the names of
the voice. From other passages, however, it becomes clear that vâ´*s*î
is a weapon of the Maruts; and Sâya*n*a, too, explains it sometimes in
that sense: cf. V, 53, 4; 57, 2. Thus I, 88, 3, the vâ´*s*îs are spoken
of as being on the bodies of the Maruts. In V, 53, 4, the Maruts are
said to shine in their ornaments and their vâ´*s*îs. Here Sâya*n*a, too,
translates vâ´*s*î rightly by weapon; and in his remarks on I, 88, 3, he
says that vâ´*s*î was a weapon commonly called ârâ, which is a
shoemaker's awl. See Dhammapada, ver. 401. This reminds one of framea,
which at one time was supposed to he connected with the German pfrieme.
See, however, Grimm (Deutsche Grammatik, vol. i, p. 128) and Leo Meyer
(Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. vi, p. 424). In VIII, 29, 3, the god
Tvash*t*ar is said to carry an iron vâ´*s*î in his hand. Grassman
(Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xvi, p. 163) translates vâ´*s*î by axe. That
is to be taken in the sense of ornament, and not in the sense of
ointment, is shown by passages like VIII, 29, 1, where a golden ornament
is mentioned, a*ñg*í aṅkte hira*n*yáyam. Sâkám, together, is used with
reference to the birth of the Maruts; see I, 64, 4. It should not be
connected with vâ´*s*îbhi*h*.

##### Verse 3.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: I hear the cracking of the whips
in their hands, wonderfully inspiring (courage) in the fight.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Schier hier erschallt der
Peitsche Knall, wenn sie in ihrer Hand erklingt; leuchtend fahr’n sie im
Sturm herab.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Als ware es hier, so hört man es,
wenn die geisslen in ihren händen knallen; wunderbar strecken sie auf
ihrer fart sich nieder.

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

Note <span id="an_1:37:3:1">1</span>. Eshâm should be pronounced as a
creticus; also in verses 9, 13, 15. This is a very common vyûha. On the
whips as lightning, see Grimm, Donner, p. 27.

Note <span id="an_1:37:3:2">2</span>. I should have taken *k*itrám as an
adverb, like Benfey, if ni *riñg* were not usually construed with an
accusative. *Riñg* in the 3rd pers. plur. pres. Âtm. is treated like a
verb of the Ad-class. The SV. seems to read yâmam, and the commentator
explains it by ratham.

Note <span id="an_1:37:3:3">3</span>. The locative yâ´man is frequently
used of the path on which the gods move and approach the sacrifice;
hence it sometimes means, as in our passage, in the sky. Yâ´mam in BR.,
s. v. ar*g*, is wrong.

We might also translate: 'Here, close by, I hear what the whips in their
hands say; they drive forth the beautiful (chariot) on the road.' See
SV. I, 2, 1, 5, 1, comm.

##### Verse 4.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Address the god-given prayer to
those who are your strength, the destroyers of foes, the powerful,
possessed of brilliant reputation.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Singt eurer Schaar, der
wühlenden, der strahlenreichen, kräftigen ein gotterfülletes Gebet!

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Eurer künen schar, von blendender
herlichkeit, der kraftvollen, soll ein von den göttern eingegebenes
brahma gesungen werden.

Note <span id="an_1:37:4:1">1</span>. Benfey translates gh*rí*shvi by
burrowing, and refers it to the thunderbolt that uproots the earth. He
points out that gh*rí*shvi means also, for the same reason, the boar, as
proved by Kuhn (Die Herabkunft des Feuers, S. 202). Gh*ri*sh*t*i is
evidently a common name for boar, the Norse gríss, and the god of the
wind, Grimnir or Grimr, is conceived as a boar, shaking the cornfield,
in such phrases as 'Der Eber geht ins Korn' (Gentha, l. c. p. 14). I
prefer, however, in this place the general sense assigned to the
adjective gh*rí*shu and gh*rí*shvi, exuberant, brisk, wild. See Kuhn in
Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xi, p. 385. Wilson, after Sâya*n*a, translates
destroyers of foes. On the representation of the clouds as boars, see
Nir. V, 4.

Note <span id="an_1:37:4:2">2</span>. Tveshá-dyumna is difficult to
render. Both

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

tveshá and dyumná are derived from roots that mean to shine, to be
bright, to glow. Derivatives from tvish express the idea of fieriness,
fierceness, and fury. In IV, 17, 2, tvish is used correlatively, with
manyú, wrath. Derivatives from dyu convey the idea of brightness and
briskness. Both qualities are frequently applied to the Maruts.

##### Verse 5.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Praise the sportive and
resistless might of the Maruts, who were born amongst kine, and whose
strength has been nourished by (the enjoyment of) the milk.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Preist hoch die muntre
Marutschaar die unbesiegbar in den Küh’n, im Schlund des Safts wuchs sie
heran.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Preise wie unter kühen den stier,
(so) der Marut spilende schar, beim verschlingen des saftes ist sie
grosz geworden.

Note <span id="an_1:37:5:1">1</span>. This translation is merely
conjectural. I suppose that the wind driving the clouds before him, is
here compared to a bull among cows, cf. V, 52, 3:

té syandrâ´sa*h* ná ukshá*n*a*h* áti skandanti *s*árvarî*h*.

They, the Maruts, like rushing bulls, mount on the dark cows.

The last sentence states that the wind grows even stronger after it has
tasted the rain (I, 85, 2. té ukshitâ´sa*h* mahimâ´nam â*s*ata).

Note <span id="an_1:37:5:2">2</span>. I take *g*ámbhe in the sense of
*g*ámbhane. (On the root *g*abh and its derivatives, see Kuhn,
Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachwissenschaft, vol. i, p. 123 seq.)
It would be better to read mukhe, instead of sukhe, in the commentary.
The Maruts were not born of milk for P*ris*ni, as Wilson says in a note,
but from the milk of P*ris*ni. P*ris*ni is called their mother, Rudra
their father: (V, 52, 16; 60, 5.)

Benfey takes the cows for clouds in which the lightnings dwell; and the
abyss of the sap is by him supposed to be again the clouds.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

##### Verse 6.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Which is chief leader among you,
agitators of heaven and earth, who shake all around, like the top (of a
tree)?

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Wer, Helden! ist der erste
euch—ihr Erd- und Himmel-schû´tterer!—wenn ihr sie schû´ttelt Wipfeln
gleich?

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Wer ist der grô´sste bei euch,
helden, wenn vom himel und der erde, schû´tteler, ihr am saume gleichsam
rû´ttelt!

Note <span id="an_1:37:6:1">1</span>. Ántam ná, literally, like an end,
is explained by Sâya*n*a as the top of a tree. Wilson, Langlois, and
Benfey accept that interpretation. Roth proposes, like the hem of a
garment, which I prefer; for vastrânta, the end of a garment, is a
common expression in later Sanskrit, while anta is never applied to a
tree in the sense of the top of a tree. Here agra would be more
appropriate.

##### Verse 7.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: The householder, in dread of your
fierce and violent approach, has planted a firm (buttress); for the
many-ridged mountain is shattered (before you).

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Vor eurem Gange beuget sich, vor
eurem wilden Zorn der Mann; der Hügel weichet und der Berg.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Vor eurem anzug, eurem gewaltigen
eifer, niederduckte sich der mensch, wich der festgeknotete
\[wolken\]berg.

Note <span id="an_1:37:7:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a translates: 'Man has
planted a firm buttress to give stability to his dwelling.' The reading
ni for ni, which Aufrecht adopted, is untenable, as Ludwig shows. It has
been altered in the second edition. See also VIII, 7, 5, ni yemiré.
Nidadhré is the perfect Âtmanepada, and expresses the holding down of
the head or the cowering attitude of man. I have taken ugrâ´ya manyáve
over to *g*íhîta, because these words could hardly form an apposition to
yâ´mâya. As the Vedic poets speak of the very mountains as shaken by the
storms, we might translate párvato girí*h* by the gnarled or rocky
mount;

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

but there is no authority for translating *g*íhîta by it is shattered,
and we should have to translate, the mountain yielded or bent before
your anger. Cf. V, 57, 3:

ní va*h* vánâ *g*ihate yâ´mana*h* bhiyâ´.

The forests get out of your way from fear.

V, 60, 2. vánâ *k*it ugrâ*h* *g*ihate ní va*h* bhiyâ´ p*ri*thivî´ *k*it
re*g*ate párvata*h* *k*it.

Even the forests, ye fearful Maruts, yield from fear of you; even the
earth trembles, even the mountain.

In I, 166, 5, yát tveshá-yâmâ*h* nadáyanta párvatân, we may translate
'when they on their fiery course made the parvatas (clouds) to sound or
thunder,' but it is more likely that nâdayati here means to cause to
shake or vibrate, and that parvata stands for mountain. We ought to
remember such poetical expressions as 1 Kings xix. 11, 'and a great,
strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the
Lord.'

##### Verse 8.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: At whose impetuous approach earth
trembles; like an enfeebled monarch, through dread (of his enemies).

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Bei deren Lauf bei deren Sturm
die Erde zittert voller Furcht, wie ein altergebeugter Mann.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Bei deren märschen zitterte wie
ein gealtet stammeshaupt die erd vor furcht auf ihren wegen.

Note <span id="an_1:37:8:1">1</span>. Á*g*ma seems to express the act of
racing or running (like â*g*i, race, battle), while yâ´ma is the road
itself where the racing takes place. A very similar passage occurs in I,
87, 3. The comparison of the earth (fem.) to a king (masc.) would be
considered a grave offence in the later Sanskrit literature. In I, 87,
3, vithurâ´ takes the place of vi*s*páti.

##### Verse 9.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Stable is their birthplace, (the
sky); yet the birds (are able) to issue from (the sphere of) their
parent: for your strength is everywhere (divided) between two
(regions,—or, heaven and earth).

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Kaum geboren sind sie so stark,
dass ihrer Mutter sie entfliehn: ist ja doch zwiefach ihre Kraft.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Denn fest ist ihr geburtsort,
vögel (sind sie) von der mutter fortzugehn, nach dem, wie von altersher
ihre kraft.

Oder, Denn fest ist ihre kraft geworden von der mutter sich zu trennen,
da schon von alters her ihre kraft diss wollte.

Note <span id="an_1:37:9:1">1</span>. A very difficult verse. The birth
of the Maruts is frequently alluded to, as well as their surpassing
strength, as soon as born. Hence the first sentence admits of little
doubt. But what follows is very abrupt. Váyas may be the plural of vi,
bird, or it may be váyas, the neuter, meaning vital strength: see Kuhn's
Zeitschrift, vol. xv, p. 217. The Maruts are frequently compared to
birds (cf. I, 87, 2; 88, I), but it is usual to indicate the comparison
by ná or iva. I therefore take váyas as a nom. sing. neut., in the sense
of vigour, life. They are called b*ri*hadvayasa*h* in a Nivid; see
Ludwig, p. 226. Nir-i is used with particular reference to the birth of
a child (cf. V, 78, 7; 9).

##### Verse 10.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: They are the generators of
speech: they spread out the waters in their courses: they urge the
lowing (cattle) to enter (the water), up to their knees, (to drink.)

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: In ihrem Lauf erheben dann diese
Söhne Getös und Fluth, die bis zum Knie den Kühen geht.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Und dise söne, die sänger, denten
auf ihren zügen ihre banen aus, so dass brüllend sie uns ganz nahe
kamen.

Note <span id="an_1:37:10:1">1</span>. If we could take sûnáva*h*
gíra*h* in the sense of the sons of voice, i. e. of thunder, which would
remove many difficulties, the accent of gíra*h* would have to be
changed. The commentator takes sûnu in the sense of utpâdaka, producers
of sound. Gíra*h*, however, occurs at least once more, in the sense of
singers or poets, IX, 63, 10, where gíra*h* can only be a vocative, O ye
singers! In I, 6, 6, the translation of gíra*h* by singers, i. e. the
Maruts, may be contested, but if we consider that gíra*h*, in the sense
of

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

hymns, is feminine, and is followed by the very word which is here used,
viz. devayánta*h*, as a feminine, viz. devayántî*h*, VII, 18, 3, we can
hardly doubt that in I, 6, 6, gíra*h* is a masculine and means singers.
The same applies to VI, 63, 10. In VI, 52, 9, ûpa na*h* sûnáva*h*
gíra*h* *srin*vántu am*rí*tasya yé, the construction is, of course,
quite different.

Note <span id="an_1:37:10:2">2</span>. The expression that the Maruts
enlarged or extended the fences of their race-course (RV. IV, 58, 7),
can only mean that they swept over the whole sky, and drove the clouds
away from all the corners. Kâ´sh*th*â may mean the wooden enclosures
(carceres) or the wooden poles that served as turning and winning-posts
(metae). The Sâma-Veda has ya*gñ*eshu instead of a*g*meshu. That the
translation of this verse is purely tentative, and far from
satisfactory, was known to all Vedic scholars, but I doubt whether they
will consider the interpretation which M. Bergaigne proposes with so
much assurance, as less tentative and more satisfactory. He translates
(Journ. As. 1884, p. 239), des fils ont, dans leur marche, allongé leurs
chants comme des chemins, pour y marcher à genoux (sur les genoux) en
mugissant (en chantant).' I shall content myself with shortly pointing
out the misgivings which every Vedic scholar would feel at once in
proposing such a rendering. First as to the conception itself. Can a
poet say, 'The Maruts have stretched out their songs in order to march
on them on their knees?' 'The roads,' as M. Bergaigne shows himself, are
only a simile, and no one walks on a simile. Secondly, the idea that
these Maruts widened the roads on which they march, is common enough,
but that they lengthened their songs, like paths, is never said by the
Vedic *Ri*shis, nor would they in such a case have left out the particle
na or iva. Lastly, though many things are said of the Maruts, I do not
remember that they ever appear on their knees. I do not think,
therefore, that M. Bergaigne's infallible method helps us much beyond
where we were before. Conjectures are easy, but for that very reason,
one does not like to bring them forward. One might propose to read
sûnáva*h* divá*h*, a very common name of the Maruts. One might go a step
further, identify

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

gi*h* with bhâratî, and point out that the Maruts are called the sons of
Bharata, II, 36, 2. But all this leaves us in utter uncertainty, and
where a scholar feels the ground so uncertain beneath his feet, he
hesitates to speak with papal authority. M. Bergaigne's strong point is
that abhi*gñ*ú means on their knees, not up to their knees. Here again,
I ask, does abhi in prepositional compounds ever mean on? If abhi*gñ*ú
is used in the same sense in which we use 'on our knees,' it would in
Sanskrit mean only 'bowing up to the knees.' Now in I, 72, 5, abhi*gñ*ú
seems to express a positive expression of reverence. With regard to the
other passages where abhi*gñ*ú occurs, M. Bergaigne has not shown how
they ought to be translated so as to give a clear sense. I do not
pretend to solve the difficulties, but I think it is better to confess
our difficulties than to hide them under the veil of a so-called
systematic interpretation. Abhi*gñ*ú, like mita*gñ*u, may have expressed
a position of the knees, expressive of strength, but on such points very
little information is to be gained from Indian commentators.

The last sentence expresses the result of this race, viz. the falling of
so much rain that the cows had to walk up to their knees in water. This
becomes still clearer from the next verse.

<span class="smallcaps">Sâya*n*a</span>: These, the producers of speech,
have spread water in their courses, they cause the cows to walk up to
their knees hi order to drink the water.

##### Verse 11.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: They drive before them, in their
course, the long, vast, uninjurable, rain-retaining cloud.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Dann treiben sie im Sturm heran
jenen langen and breiten Spross der Wolke unerschöpflichen.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Sogar disen langen, breiten, das
kind der wolke, den unfeindlichen, schleudern auf ihren Zügen sie
vorwärts.

Note <span id="an_1:37:11:1">1</span>. Rain is called the offspring of
the cloud, mihó nápât, and is then treated as a masculine; cf. apâm
nápât, &c.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

##### Verse 12.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Maruts, as you have vigour,
invigorate mankind: give animation to the clouds.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: O Marut’s! mit der Kraft, die ihr
besitzt, werft ihr Geschöpfe um, die Berge werft ihr um sogar.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: O Marut, so wie eure kraft ist,
warft ihr die leute nieder, warft ihr die berge nieder.

Note <span id="an_1:37:12:1">1</span>. In VIII, 72, 8, a*k*u*k*yavît is
explained by vyadârayat, he tore open. A*k*u*k*yavîtana is the Vedic
form of the 2nd pers. plur. of the reduplicated aorist.

##### Verse 13.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Wherever the Maruts pass, they
fill the way with clamour: every one hears their (noise).

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Wenn die Marut's des Weges ziehn,
dann sprechen mit einander sie und mancher mag sie hören.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Wenn die Marut wandern, sprechen
auf dem weg sie mit einander, es höret sie ein jeder.

Note <span id="an_1:37:13:1">1</span>. Yânti has to be pronounced as an
amphibrachys.

##### Verse 14.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Come quickly, with your swift
(vehicles). The offerings of the Ka*n*vas are prepared. Be pleased with
them.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Auf schnellen kommet schnell
herbei, bei Ka*n*va’s Spross sind Feste euch: da wollt euch schön
ergötzen.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Brecht rasch auf mit raschen
rossen, bei den Ka*n*va’s ist euer dienst, dort eben erfreuet euch.

Note <span id="an_1:37:14:1">1</span>. Benfey supposes that dúva*h*
stands in the singular instead of the plural. But why should the plural
have been used, as the singular (asti) would have created no kind of
difficulty? It is better to take dúva*h* as a nominative plural of a
noun dû, worshipper, derived from the same root which yielded dúva*h*,
worship. We certainly find á-duva*h*, as a nom. plur., in the sense of
not-worshipping:

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

VII, 4, 6. mâ´ tvâ vayám sahasâ-van avî´râ*h* mâ´ ápsava*h* pári sadâma
mâ´ áduva*h*.

May we not, O hero, sit round thee like men without strength, without
beauty (cf. VIII, 7, 7), without worship.

Here Sâya*n*a explains áduva*h* very well by pari*k*ara*n*ahînâ*h*,
which seems better than Roth's explanation 'zögernd, ohne Eifer.'

##### Verse 15.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: The offering is prepared for your
gratification: we are your (worshippers), that we may live all our life.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Gerüstet ist für euren Rausch und
wir gehören, traun! euch an für unser ganzes Lebelang.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Er ist euch zur trunkesfreude,
und wir gleichfalls euer hier, dass unsere ganze dauer wir erleben.
