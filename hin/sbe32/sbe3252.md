### MA*ND*ALA VIII, HYMN 94.

#### ASH*T*AKA VI, ADHYÂYA 6, VARGA 28-29.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. The cow, wishing for glory, the mother of the bounteous Maruts,
sends forth her milk; the two horses [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:1:1) have
been harnessed to the chariots,—

2\. She in whose lap [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:2:1) all gods observe their
duties, sun and moon (also), that they may be seen;

3\. Therefore all our friends [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:3:1), the singers,
invite the Maruts always, to drink (our) Soma.

4\. This Soma here has been prepared, the Maruts drink of it, the
A*s*vins also drink of the lord (Soma) [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:4:1).

5\. Mitra, Aryaman, Varu*n*a drink of the Soma which is continually
[1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:5:1) clarified, dwelling in three abodes
[2](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:5:2), procuring offspring.

6\. May Indra also rejoice to his satisfaction in this pressed juice,
mixed with milk, like a Hot*ri* [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:6:1) at the
morning-sacrifice.

7\. Did the brilliant lords flare up? Endowed with pure strength they
rush, like water, through their enemies.

8\. Shall I now choose the favour of you, the great gods, who by
yourselves shine forth marvellously,

9\. The Maruts, who, when going to drink Soma, spread out the whole
earth and the lights of heaven [1](sbe3252.htm#an_8:94:9:1).

10\. I call now them who are endowed with pure strength, you, O Maruts,
from heaven, that you may drink the Soma here;

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

11\. I call now those Maruts who hold heaven and earth asunder, that
they may drink the Soma here;

12\. I call now that manly company of the Maruts, dwelling in the
mountains, that they may drink the Soma here.

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Bindu or Pûtadaksha. Metre, Gâyatrî. Verse 1 = SV. I, 149;
verse 4 = SV. I, 174; II, 1135; verse 5. = SV. II, 1136; verse 6 = SV.
II, 1137. The whole hymn can easily be divided into t*rik*as.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_8:94:1:1">1</span>. I adopt Ludwig's correction of the
Pada, changing váhni*h* to váhnî iti, though it interrupts somewhat the
connection between the first and second verses. Still it seems as
impossible to change P*ris*ni, the mother of the Maruts, into a
cart-horse as into a sucking-calf. This we should have to do, if we took
dhayati in its usual sense of sucking. Still dhayati means to suck, not
to suckle. The commentary to the SV. explains vahni*h* as vo*dh*rî, the
driver.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_8:94:2:1">1</span>. I should prefer to take upásthe in
the sense of proximity, which, as in the case of v*ri*kshopasthe, may be
translated by shadow, or protection.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_8:94:3:1">1</span>. I cannot believe that we can take
aryá â´ in our passage as aryé â´, and translate it with Pischel
(Z. D. M. G. XL, p. 125) by 'our singers among the Aryas.' With the
plural kâráva*h* we should expect aryéshu â´, not aryé â´; sec also
Bergaigne, III, 287; II, 218. Pâda a and b are galita, see VI, 45, 33.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_8:94:4:1">1</span>. Svarâ*g* seems to be meant for
Soma as lord, not as brilliant.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_8:94:5:1">1</span>. Tánâ is generally explained by
ûrnâstukanirmita da*s*âpavitra; see also Bergaigne, I, 179.

Note <span id="an_8:94:5:2">2</span>. The three abodes are either the
morning. noon,

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

and evening sacrifices, or the three Soma-vessels, the Dro*n*akala*s*a,
Âdhavanîya, and Pûtabh*ri*t.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_8:94:6:1">1</span>. I do not see why hótâ-iva should
not mean 'like the priest,' for the priest also rejoices in the
libation; see Arthasa*m*graha, ed. Thibaut, pp. 10 and 20. Ludwig
prefers to take hótâ for Agni, fire.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_8:94:9:1">1</span>. See note to I, 6, 9, and 10, note
1.
