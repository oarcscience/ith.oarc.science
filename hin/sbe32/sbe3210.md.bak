*Vedic Hymns, Part I (SBE32)*, by Max Müller, \[1891\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most powerful instrument that has hitherto been applied to the
emendation of Vedic texts, is the metre. <span class="margnote">Metrical
criticism.</span>Metre means measure, and uniform measure, and hence its
importance for critical purposes, as second only to that of grammar. If
our knowledge of the metrical system of the Vedic poets rests on a sound
basis, any deviations from the general rule are rightly objected to; and
if by a slight alteration they can be removed, and the metre be
restored, we naturally feel inclined to adopt such emendations. Two
safeguards, however, are needed in this kind of conjectural criticism.
We ought to be quite certain that the anomaly is impossible, and we
ought to be able to explain to a certain extent

<span id="page_lxxviii">p. lxxviii</span>

how the deviation from the original correct text could have occurred. As
this subject has of late years received considerable attention, and as
emendations of the Vedic texts, supported by metrical arguments, have
been carried on on a very large scale, it becomes absolutely necessary
to reexamine the grounds on which these emendations are supposed to
rest. There are, in fact, but few hymns in which some verses or some
words have not been challenged for metrical reasons, and I feel bound,
therefore, at the very beginning of my translation of the Rig-veda, to
express my own opinion on this subject, and to give my reasons why in so
many cases I allow metrical anomalies to remain which by some of the
most learned and ingenious among Vedic scholars would be pronounced
intolerable.

Even if the theory of the ancient metres had not been so carefully
worked out by the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhyas and the Anukrama*n*îs,
an independent study of the Veda would have enabled us to discover the
general rules by which the Vedic poets were guided in the composition of
their works. Nor would it have been difficult to show how constantly
these general principles are violated by the introduction of phonetic
changes which in the later Sanskrit are called the euphonic changes of
Sandhi, and according to which final vowels must be joined with initial
vowels, and final consonants adapted to initial consonants, until at
last each sentence becomes a continuous chain of closely linked
syllables.

It is far easier, as I remarked before, to discover the original and
natural rhythm of the Vedic hymns by reading them in the Pada than in
the Sa*m*hitâ text, and after some practice our ear becomes sufficiently
schooled to tell us at once how each line ought to be pronounced. We
find, on the one hand, that the rules of Sandhi, instead of being
generally binding, were treated by the Vedic poets as poetical licences
only; and, on the other, that a greater freedom of pronunciation was
allowed even in the body of words than would be tolerated in the later
Sanskrit. If a syllable was wanted to complete the metre, a semivowel
might be pronounced as a vowel, many a long vowel might

<span id="page_lxxix">p. lxxix</span>

be protracted so as to count for two syllables, and short vowels might
be inserted between certain consonants, of which no trace exists in the
ordinary Sanskrit. If, on the contrary, there were too many syllables,
then the rules of Sandhi were observed, or two short syllables
contracted by rapid pronunciation into one; nay, in a few cases, a final
m or s, it seems, was omitted. It would be a mistake to suppose that the
authors of the Prâti*s*âkhyas were not aware of this freedom allowed or
required in the pronunciation of the Vedic hymns. Though they abstained
from introducing into the text changes of pronunciation which even we
ourselves would never tolerate, if inserted in the texts of Homer and
Plautus, in the Pâli verses of Buddha, or even in modern English poetry,
the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya were clearly aware that in many places
one syllable had to be pronounced as two, or two as one. They were
clearly aware that certain vowels, generally considered as long, had to
be pronounced as short, and that in order to satisfy the demands of the
metre, certain changes of pronunciation were indispensable. They knew
all this, but they did not change the text. And this shows that the
text, as they describe it, enjoyed even in their time a high authority,
that they did not make it, but that, such as it is, with all its
incongruities, it had been made before their time. In many cases, no
doubt, certain syllables in the hymns of the Veda had been actually
lengthened or shortened in the Sa*m*hitâ text in accordance with the
metre in which they are composed. But this was done by the poets
themselves, or, at all events, it was not done by the authors of the
Prâti*s*âkhya. They simply register such changes, but they do not enjoin
them, and in this we, too, should follow their example. It is,
therefore, a point of some importance in the critical restoration and
proper pronunciation of Vedic texts, that in the rules which we have to
follow in order to satisfy the demands of the metre, we should carefully
distinguish between what is sanctioned by ancient authority, and what is
the result of our own observations. This I shall now proceed to do.

First, then, the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya distinctly admit

<span id="page_lxxx">p. lxxx</span>

that, in order to uphold the rules they have themselves laid down,
certain syllables are to be pronounced as two syllables. <span
class="margnote">Vyûha.</span>We read in Sûtra 527: 'In a deficient pâda
the right number is to be provided for by protraction of semivowels
(which were originally vowels), and of contracted vowels (which were
originally two independent vowels).' It is only by this process that the
short syllable which has been lengthened in the Sa*m*hitâ, viz. the
sixth, or the eighth, or the tenth, can be shown to have occupied and to
occupy that place where alone, according to a former rule, a short
syllable is liable to be lengthened. Thus we read:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I, 161, 11. ūdvātsv̅̆a̅̄smâ̄ ăk*rĭn*ōtănâ̄ t*rĭn*am.

</div>

This would seem to be a verse of eleven syllables, in which the ninth
syllable na has been lengthened. This, however, is against the system of
the Prâti*s*âkhya. But if we protract the semivowel v in udvatsv, and
change it back into u, which it was originally, then we gain one
syllable, the whole verse has twelve syllables, na occupies the tenth
place, and it now belongs to that class of cases which is included in a
former Sûtra, 523.

The same applies to X, 103, 13, where we read:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

pr̅̆e̅̆tâ̄ *g*ăyătâ̄ nărā*h*.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This is a verse of
seven syllables, in which the fifth syllable is lengthened, without any
authority. Let us protract pretâ by bringing it back to its original
component elements pra itâ, and we get a verse of eight syllables, the
sixth syllable now falls under the general observation, and is
lengthened in the Sa*m*hitâ accordingly.

The same rules are repeated in a later portion of the Prâti*s*âkhya.
Here rules had been given as to the number of syllables of which certain
metres consist, and it is added (Sûtras 972, 973) that where that number
is deficient, it should be completed by protracting contracted vowels,
and by separating consonantal groups in which semivowels (originally
vowels) occur, by means of their corresponding vowel.

The rules in both places are given in almost identically

<span id="page_lxxxi">p. lxxxi</span>

the same words, and the only difference between the two passages is
this, that, according to the former, semivowels are simply changed back
into their vowels, while, according to the latter, the semivowel
remains, but is separated from the preceding consonant by its
corresponding vowel.

These rules therefore show clearly that the authors of the
Prâti*s*âkhya, though they would have shrunk from altering one single
letter of the authorised Sa*m*hitâ, recognised the fact that where two
vowels had been contracted into one, they might yet be pronounced as
two; and where a vowel before another vowel had been changed into a
semivowel, it might either be pronounced as a vowel, or as a semivowel
preceded by its corresponding vowel. More than these two modifications,
however, the Prâti*s*âkhya does not allow, or, at least, does not
distinctly sanction. The commentator indeed tries to show that by the
wording of the Sûtras in both places, a third modification is
sanctioned, viz. the vocalisation, in the body of a word, of semivowels
which do not owe their origin to an original vowel. But in both places
this interpretation is purely artificial. Some such rule ought to have
been given, but it was not given by the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya. It
ought to have been given, for it is only by observing such a rule that
in I, 61, 12, gōr nă pa̅̆rv̆ă̆ vĭ rădâ̄ tĭrā*sk*â̆, we get a verse of eleven
syllables, and thus secure for dâ in radâ the eighth place, where alone
the short a could be lengthened. Yet we look in vain for a rule
sanctioning the change of semivowels into vowels, except where the
semivowels can rightly be called kshaipra-var*n*a (Sûtra 974), i. e.
semivowels that were originally vowels. The independent (svâbhâvika)
semivowels, as e. g. the v in parva, are not included; and to suppose
that in Sûtra 527 these semivowels were indicated by var*n*a is
impossible, particularly if we compare the similar wording of Sûtra
974 <span id="fr_46"></span>[a](#fn_37.md).

<span id="page_lxxxii">p. lxxxii</span>

We look in vain, too, in the Prâti*s*âkhya for another rule according to
which long vowels, even if they do not owe their origin to the
coalescence of two vowels, are liable to be protracted. However, this
rule, too, though never distinctly sanctioned, is observed in the
Prâti*s*âkhya, for unless its author observed it, he could not have
obtained in the verses quoted by the Prâti*s*âkhya the number of
syllables which he ascribes to them. According to Sûtra 937, the verse,
RV. X, 134, 1, is a Mahâpaṅkti, and consists of six pâdas, of eight
syllables each. In order to obtain that number, we must read:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

sāmrâ̄*g*ām *k*ārshă*n*î̄nâ̅̆m̅̄.

</div>

We may therefore say that, without allowing any actual change in the
received text of the Sa*m*hitâ, the Prâti*s*âkhya distinctly allows a
lengthened pronunciation of certain syllables, which in the Pada text
form two syllables; and we may add that, by implication, it allows the
same even in cases where the Pada text also gives but one instead of two
syllables. Having this authority in our favour, I do not think that we
use too much liberty if we extend this modified pronunciation,
recognised in so many cases by the ancient scholars of India themselves,
to other cases where it seems to us required as well, in order to
satisfy the metrical rules of the Veda.

Secondly, I believe it can be proved that, if not the authors of the
Prâti*s*âkhya, those at least who constituted <span
class="margnote">Shortening of long vowels.</span>the Vedic text which
was current in the ancient schools and which we now have before us, were
fully aware that certain long vowels and diphthongs could be used as
short. The authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya remark that certain changes
which can take place before a short syllable only, take place likewise
before the word no, although the vowel of this 'no' is by them supposed
to be long. After having stated in Sûtra 523 that the eighth syllable of
hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided
a short syllable

<span id="page_lxxxiii">p. lxxxiii</span>

follows, they remark that for this purpose na*h* or no is treated as a
short syllable:

X, 59, 4. dyŭ-bhī*h* hĭtā*h* *g*ărĭmâ̄ sŭ nă̂*h* āstū, (Sa*m*h. sû no
astu.)

Again, in stating that the tenth syllable of hendecasyllabics and
dodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided a short syllable
follows, the same exception is understood to be made in favour of na*h*
or no, as a short syllable:

VII, 48, 4. nŭ dēvâ̄sā*h* vărĭvā*h* kārtănă nā*h*, (Sa*m*h. kārtănâ̄ nŏ,
bhûta no, &c.)

With regard to e being shortened before a short a where, according to
rule, the a should be elided, we actually find that the Sa*m*hitâ gives
a instead of e in RV. VIII, 72, 5. véti stótave ambyãm, Sa*m*h. véti
stótava ambyãm. (Prâti*s*. 177, 5.)

I do not ascribe very much weight to the authority which we may derive
from these observations with regard to our own treatment of the
diphthongs e and o as either long or short in the Veda, yet in answer to
those who are incredulous as to the fact that the vowels e and o could
ever be short in Sanskrit, an appeal to the authority of those who
constituted our text, and in constituting it clearly treated o as a
short vowel, may not be without weight. We may also appeal to the fact
that in Pâli and Prâk*ri*t every final o and e can be treated as either
long or short <span id="fr_47"></span>[a](#fn_38.md). Starting from this we
may certainly extend this observation, as it has been extended by
Professor Kuhn, but we must not extend it too far It is quite clear that
in the same verse e and o can be used both as long and short. I give the
Sa*m*hitâ text:

I, 84, 17.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

ka îshate \| tu*g*yate kō bĭbhâ̄yā  
ko ma*m*sate \| santam indrā*m* kŏ āntī,  
kas tokâya \| ka ibhâyōtă râ̄yē  
adhi bravat \| tanve kō *g*ănâ̄yā.

</div>

<span id="page_lxxxiv">p. lxxxiv</span>

But although there can be no doubt that e and o, when final, or at the
end of the first member of a compound, may be treated in the Veda as
anceps, there is no evidence, I believe, to show that the same licence
applies to a medial or initial e or o. In IV, 45, 5, we must scan

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

usrâ*h* *g*arante prati vastō*h* ā*s*vĭnâ̄,

</div>

ending the verse with an epitritus tertius instead of the usual
dijambus <span id="fr_48"></span>[a](#fn_39.md).

Thirdly, the fact that the initial short a, if following upon a word
ending in o or e, is frequently not to be elided, is clearly recognised
by the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya (see [p.
xlviii](sbe3205.htm#page_xlviii).md). Nay, that they wished it to be
pronounced even in passages where, in accordance with the requirements
of the Prâti*s*âkhya, it had to disappear in the Sa*m*hitâ text, we may
conclude from Sûtra 978. It is there stated that no pâda should ever
begin with a word that has no accent. The exceptions to this rule are
few, and they are discussed in Sûtras 978-987. But if the initial a were
not pronounced in I, 1, 9, sá*h* na*h* pitâ´-iva sûnáve ágne
su-upâyaná*h* bhava, the second pâda would begin with <sup>ऽ</sup>gne, a
word which, after the elision of the initial a, would be a word without
an accent <span id="fr_49"></span>[b](#fn_40.md).

Fourthly, the fact that other long vowels, besides e and o, may under
certain circumstances be used as short in the Veda, is not merely a
modern theory, but rests on no less an authority than Pâ*n*ini himself.

<span id="page_lxxxv">p. lxxxv</span>

Pâ*n*ini says, VI, I, 127, that i, u, *ri* (see RV. Bh. IV, 1, 12) at
the end of a pada (but not in a compound <span
id="fr_50"></span>[a](#fn_41).md) may remain unchanged, if a different
vowel follows, and that, if long, they may be shortened. He ascribes
this rule, or, more correctly, the first portion of it only, to
*S*âkalya, Prâti*s*âkhya 155 seq. <span id="fr_51"></span>[b](#fn_42.md)
Thus *k*akrî atra may become *k*akrĭ atra or *k*akry atra. Madhû atra
may become madhŭ atra or madhv atra. In VI, 1, 128, Pâ*n*ini adds that
a, i, u, *ri* may remain unchanged before *ri*, and, if long, may be
shortened, and this again according to the teaching of *S*âkalya, i. e.
Prâti*s*âkhya 136 <span id="fr_52"></span>[c](#fn_43.md). Hence brahmâ
*ri*shi*h* becomes brahmă *ri*shi*h* or brahmarshi*h*; kumârî *ris*ya*h*
becomes kumârĭ *ris*ya*h* or kumâry *ris*ya*h*. This rule enables us to
explain a number of passages in which the Sa*m*hitâ text either changes
the final long vowel into a semivowel, or leaves it unchanged, when the
vowel is a prag*ri*hya vowel. To the first class belong such passages as
I, 163, 12; IV, 38, 10, vâ*g*î´ árvâ, Sa*m*h. vâ*g*yárvâ; VI, 7, 3,
vâ*g*î´ agne, Sa*m*h. vâ*g*yãgne; VI, 20, 13, pakthî´ arkaí*h*, Sa*m*h.
pakthyãrkaí*h*; IV, 22, 4, *s*ushmî´ â´ gó*h*, Sa*m*h. *s*ushmyâ´ gó*h*.
In these passages î is the termination of a nom. masc. of a stem ending
in in. Secondly, IV, 24, 8, pátnî á*kkh*a, Sa*m*h. pátnyá*kkh*a; IV, 34,
1, devî´ áhnâm, Sa*m*h. devyáhnâm; V, 75, 4, vâ´*n*î*k*i â´-hitâ,
Sa*m*h. vâ´*n*î*k*yâ´hitâ; VI, 61, 4, avitrî´ avatu, Sa*m*h.
avitryãvatu. In these passages the î is the termination of feminines. In
X, 15, 4, ûtî´ arvâ´k, Sa*m*h. ûtyãrvâ´k, the final î of the
instrumental ûtî ought not to have been changed into a semivowel, for,
though not followed by íti, it is to be treated as prag*ri*hya;
(Prâti*s*. 163, 5.) It is, however,

<span id="page_lxxxvi">p. lxxxvi</span>

mentioned as an exception in Sûtra 174, 9. The same applies to II, 3, 4,
védî íti asyâ´m, Sa*m*h. védyasyâ´m. The prag*ri*hya î ought not to have
been changed into a semivowel, but the fact that it had been changed
irregularly, was again duly registered in Sûtra 174, 5. These two
prag*ri*hya î therefore, which have really to be pronounced short, were
irregularly changed in the Sa*m*hitâ into the semivowel; and as this
semivowel, like all semivowels, may take vyavâya, the same object was
attained as if it had been written by a short vowel. With regard to
prag*ri*hya û, no such indication is given by the Sa*m*hitâ text; but in
such passages as I, 46, 13, *s*ambhû íti *s*am-bhû â´ gatam, Sa*m*h.
*s*ambhû â´ gatam; V, 43, 4, bâhû´ íti ádrim, Sa*m*h. bâhû´ ádrim, the
prag*ri*hya û of the dual can be used as short, like the û of madhû
atra, given as an example by the commentators of Pâ*n*ini.

To Professor Kuhn, I believe, belongs the merit of having extended this
rule to final â. That the â of the dual may become short, was mentioned
in the Prâti*s*âkhya, Sûtra 309, though in none of the passages there
mentioned is there any metrical necessity for this shortening (see [p.
lii](sbe3205.htm#page_lii).md). This being the case, it is impossible to
deny that where this â is followed by a vowel, and where Sandhi between
the two vowels is impossible, the final â may be treated as short.
Whether it must be so treated, depends on the view which we take of the
Vedic metres, and will have to be discussed hereafter.

I agree with Professor Kuhn when he scans:

VI, 63, 1. kv̆ă tyâ̄ vālgû̄ pŭrŭ-hû̄tâ̆ ādyā, (Sa*m*h. puru-hûtâdya); and not
kv̆ā ty̆â̄ vālgû̄ pŭrŭhû̄tâ̄dyā, although we might quote other verses as
ending with an epitritus primus.

IV, 3, 13. mâ̄ vē*s*āsyă pră-mĭnătā*h* mâ̆ â̄pē*h*, (Sa*m*h. mâpe*h*,)
although the dispondeus is possible.

I, 77, 1. kăthâ̄ dâ̄*s*ēmă āgnăyē kâ̆ āsmai, (Sa*m*h. kâsmai.)

VI, 24, 5. āryā*h* vă*s*āsyă părĭ-ētâ̆ āstī.

Even in a compound like tvâ-ûta, I should shorten the first vowel, e. g.

X, 148, 1. tmănâ̄ tănâ̄ sănŭyâ̄mă tvâ̆-û̄tâ̄*h*,

although the passage is not mentioned by the Prâti*s*âkhya

<span id="page_lxxxvii">p. lxxxvii</span>

among those where a short final vowel in the eighth place is not
lengthened when a short syllable follows <span
id="fr_53"></span>[a](#fn_44.md).

But when we come to the second pâda of a Gâyatrî, and find there a long
â, and that long â not followed by a vowel, I cannot agree with
Professor Kuhn, that the long â, even under such circumstances, ought to
be shortened. We may scan:

V, 5, 7. vâ̄tāsyă pātmăn î̄*l*ĭtâ̄ dāivyâ̄ hōtâ̄râ̄ mănŭshā*h*.

The same choriambic ending occurs even in the last pâda of a Gâyatrî,
and is perfectly free from objection at the end of the other pâdas.

So, again, we may admit the shortening of au to o in sâno avye and sâno
avyaye, as quoted in the Prâti*s*âkhya, 174 and 177, but this would not
justify the shortening of au to av in Anush*t*ubh verses, such as

V, 86, 5.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

mārtâ̄yă dēvâū ădăbhâ̄,  
ā*ms*â̄-ivă dēvâ̄u ārvătē,

</div>

while, with regard to the Trish*t*ubh and *G*agatî verses, our views on
these metres must naturally depend on the difficulties we meet with in
carrying them out systematically.

There is no reason for shortening â in

V, 5, 10. dēvâ̄nâ̄m gūhyâ̄ nâ̄mâ̄nī.

It is the second pâda of a Gâyatrî here; and we shall see that, even in
the third pâda, four long syllables occur again and again.

For the same reason I cannot follow Dr. Kuhn in a number of other
passages where, for the sake of the metre, he proposes to change a long
â into a short one. Such passages are in the Pada text:

VI, 46, 11. dīdyăvā*h* tīgmă-mû̄rdhâ̄nā*h*, not mû̄rdhâ̆nā*h*.

I, 15, 6. *rĭ*tŭnâ̄ yā*gñ*ăm â̄*s*â̄thē, not â̄*s*â̆thē.

V, 66, 2. sāmyăk ăsūryăm â̄*s*â̄tē, not â̄*s*â̆tē.

V, 67, 1. vārshīsh*th*ām kshātrăm â̄sâ̄thē, not â̄*s*â̆thē. See Beiträge,
vol. iii, p. 122.

I, 46, 6. tâ̄m āsmē râ̄sâ̄thâ̄m ĭshām, not râ̄sâ̆thâ̄m ĭshām.

<span id="page_lxxxviii">p. lxxxviii</span>

IV, 32, 23. băbhrû̄ yâ̄mēshŭ *s*ōbhētē, not *s*ōbhĕtē.

IV, 45, 3. ŭtă prĭyām mădhŭnē yū*ñg*â̄thâ̄m răthām, not yū*ñg*â̆thâ̄m
răthām.

V. 74, 3. kăm ā*kkh*ă yū*ñg*â̄thē răthām, not yū*ñg*â̆thē răthām.

IV, 55, 1. dyâ̄vâ̄bhû̄mî̄ (íti) ădĭtē trâ̄sî̄thâ̄m nā*h*, not trâ̄sî̆thâ̄m nā*h*.

V, 41, 1. *rĭ*tāsyă vâ̄ sădăsĭ trâ̄sî̄thâ̄m nā*h*, not trâ̄sî̆thâ̄m nā*h*.

I must enter the same protest against shortening other long vowels in
the following verses which Professor Kuhn proposes to make metrically
correct by this remedy:

I, 42, 6. hĭrā*n*yăvâ̄*s*î̄māt-tămā, not vâ̄*s*î̆māt-tȃmā.

Here the short syllable of ga*n*a*s*rĭ-bhi*h* in V, 60, 8, cannot be
quoted as a precedent, for the i in ga*n*a*s*ri, walking in companies,
was never long, and could therefore not be shortened. Still less can we
quote nâri-bhya*h* as an instance of a long î being shortened, for
nâri-bhya*h* is derived from nâri*h*, not from nârî, and occurs with a
short i even when the metre requires a long syllable; I, 43, 6.
n*ri̅*-bhyā*h* nâ̄rĭ̄-bhy̆ā*h* găvē. The fact is, that in the Rig-veda the
forms nârishu and nârî-bhya*h* never occur, but always nârishu,
nâri-bhya*h*; while from vâ*s*î we never find any forms with short i,
but always vâ´*s*îshu, vâ´*s*î-bhi*h*.

Nor is there any justification for change in I, 25, 16. gâ̄vā*h* nă
gāvyû̄tî̄*h* ănū, the second pâda of a Gâyatrî. Nor in V, 56, 3.
*ri̅*kshā*h* nă vā*h* mărŭtā*h* *s*ĭmî̄-vâ̄n ămā*h*. In most of the
passages mentioned by Professor Kuhn on p. 122, this peculiarity may be
observed, that the eighth syllable is short, or, at all events, may be
short, when the ninth is long:

VI, 44, 21. v*ri̅*sh*n*ē tē īndū*h* v*rĭ*shăbhă ̍ pî̄pâ̄yā.

I, 73, 1. sy̆ōnă-*s*î̄*h* ătĭthī*h* nă ̍ prî̄*n*â̄nāh.

VII, 13, 1. bhărē hăvī*h* nă bărhĭshĭ ̍ iprî̄*n*â̄nā*h*.

II, 28, 7. ēnā*h* k*ri̅n*vāntăm ăsŭră ̍ bhrî̄*n*āntī.

Before, however, we can settle the question whether in

<span id="page_lxxxix">p. lxxxix</span>

these and other places certain vowels should be pronounced as either
long or short, we must settle the more general <span
class="margnote">Metre and Grammar.</span>question, what authority we
have for requiring a long or a short syllable in certain places of the
Vedic metres.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_37"></span>[lxxxi:a](sbe3210.htm#fr_46.md) It will be seen
from my edition of the Prâti*s*âkhya, particularly from the extracts
from Uva*t*a, given after Sûtra 974, that the idea of making two
syllables out of go*h*, never entered Uva*t*a's mind. M. Regnier was
right, Professor Kuhn (Beiträge, vol. iv, p. 187) was wrong. Uva*t*a, no
doubt, wishes to show that original (svâbhâvika) semivowels are liable
to vyûha, or at least <span id="page_lxxxii">p. lxxxii</span> to
vyavâya; but though this is true in fact, Uva*t*a does not succeed in
his attempt to prove that the rules of the Prâti*s*âkhya sanction it.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[lxxxiii:a](sbe3210.htm#fr_47.md) See Lassen, Inst.
Linguæ Pracriticæ, pp. 145, 147, 151; Cowell, Vararu*k*i, Introduction,
p. xvii. Kedârabha*tt*a says: Pâ*n*inir bhagavân prâk*ri*talaksha*n*am
api vakti sa*m*sk*ri*tâd anyat, dîrghâkshara*m* *k*a kutra*k*id ekâm
mâtrâm upaitîti. Secundum d’Alwisium commentator docet sermonem esse de
litteris Sanscriticis *e* et *o*. Cf. Pischel, De Grammaticis
prakriticis, 1874.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[lxxxiv:a](sbe3210.htm#fr_48.md) See Professor
Weber's pertinent remarks in Kuhn's Beiträge, vol. iii, p. 394. I do not
think that in the verses adduced by Professor Kuhn, in which final o is
considered by him as an iambus or trochee, this scanning is inevitable.
Thus we may scan the Sa*m*hitâ text:

I, 88, 2. rūkmō nă *k*ītr̆ā*h* sv̆ădhĭtî̄vâ̄n.

I, 141, 8. răthō nă ȳâ̆tă*h* *s*īkv̆ăbhī*h* k*rĭ*tō.

I, 174, 3. sī*m*hō nă dămĕ ăp̆â̄*m*sĭ vāstō*h*.

VI, 24, 3. ākshō nă *k*ākry̆ō*h* *s*̆û̄ră b*rĭ*hān

X, 3, 1. ĭnō r̆â̄gānn ărătīh sămīddhō.

This leaves but one of Professor Kuhn's examples (Beiträge, vol. iv, p.
192) unexplained: I, 191, 1. kaṅkato na kaṅkato, where iva for na would
remove the difficulty.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[lxxxiv:b](sbe3210.htm#fr_49.md) This subject, the
shortness of e and o in the Veda, has been admirably treated by Mr.
Maurice Bloomfield, 'Final as before Sonants,' Baltimore, 1882.
Reprinted from the American Journal of Philology, vol. iii, No. 1.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[lxxxv:a](sbe3210.htm#fr_50.md) There are certain
compounds in which, according to Professor Kuhn, two vowels have been
contracted into one short vowel. This is certainly the opinion of Hindu
grammarians, also of the compiler of the Pada text. But most of them
would admit of another explanation. Thus dhánvar*n*asa*h*, which is
divided into dhánva-ar*n*asa*h*, may be dhánu-ar*n*asa*h* (RV. V, 45,
2). Dhánar*k*am, divided into dhána-ar*k*am, may have been dhána-*rik*am
(RV. X, 46, 5). *S*atár*k*asam (RV. VII, too, 3) may be taken as
*s*atá-*rik*asam instead of *s*atá-ar*k*asam.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[lxxxv:b](sbe3210.htm#fr_51.md) In the
Prâti*s*âkhya the rule which allows vowel before vowel to remain
unchanged, is restricted to special passages, and in some of them the
two vowels are savar*n*a; cf. Sûtra 163.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[lxxxv:c](sbe3210.htm#fr_52.md) Cf. Vâ*g*asan.
Prâti*s*âkhya, IV, 48; Indische Studien, vol. ix, 309; vol. x, 406.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[lxxxvii:a](sbe3210.htm#fr_53.md) I see that
Professor Kuhn, vol. iv, p. 186, has anticipated this observation in
esh*t*au, to be read â̆-īsh*t*aū.
