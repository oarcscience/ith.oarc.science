### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 43.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 26-7.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To Rudra.</span>

1\. What could we say to Rudra, the wise, the most liberal, the most
powerful, that is most welcome to his heart,—

2\. So that Aditi [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:2:1.md) may bring Rudra's healing
to the cattle, to men, to cow, and kith,

3\. So that Mitra, that Varu*n*a, that Rudra hear us, and all the united
Maruts [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:3:1.md).

4\. We implore Rudra, the lord of songs, the lord of animal sacrifices
[1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:4:1.md), the possessor of healing medicines
[2](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:4:2.md), for health, wealth
[3](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:4:3.md), and his favour.

5\. He who shines like the bright sun, and like gold, who is the best
Vasu among the gods,

6\. May he bring health to our horse, welfare to ram and ewe, to men, to
women, and to the cow!

7\. Bestow on us, O Soma, the happiness of a hundred men, great glory of
strong manhood [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:7:1.md);

8\. O Soma [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:8:1.md), let not those who harass and
injure overthrow us; O Indu, help us to booty!

9\. Whatever beings are thine, the immortal, in the highest place of the
law, on its summit [1](sbe3255.htm#an_1:43:9:1.md), in its centre, O Soma,
cherish them, remember them who honour thee.

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Ka*n*va Ghaura, and addressed to Rudra (I, 2, 4-6), to Rudra
and Mitrâ-Varu*n*au (3), and to Soma (7-9). Metre, Gâyatrî (1-8);
Anush*t*ubh (9). Verse 2 in TS. III, 4, 11, 2; MS. IV, 12, 6.

The hymn may be divided into two, the first from 1-6, the second from
7-9. See, however, Bergaigne, III, 32, n. 1; and Recherches sur l’hist.
de la Sa*m*hitâ, I, 65. He would prefer to divide the whole into three
hymns.

##### Verse 1.

See TÂ. X, 17, I; Delbrück, Synt. Forsch. I, 246.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:43:2:1">1</span>. Ludwig takes Aditi here as a name
of Rudra; also Hillebrandt, Über die Göttin Aditi, p. 6.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:43:3:1">1</span>. The ví*s*ve sa*g*óshasa*h*,
following on Rudra, can hardly be meant for any but the Maruts, who are
often called sa*g*óshasa*h*. But it may also have been intended for all
the gods together.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:43:4:1">1</span>. Gâthápatim and medhápatim are both
difficult. We expect gâthâ´patim and medhâ´patim. If, as Ludwig
maintains, gâtha in Zend is equivalent to *ri*tu, season, then gâthapati
might be *ri*tupati, a name of Agni, X, 2, 1. But this is extremely
doubtful. We must derive gâthápati from gâthă, I, 167, 6, and medhápati
from medhă, animal sacrifice, till we know more on the subject.

Note <span id="an_1:43:4:2">2</span>. *G*álâsha-bhesha*g*am, an epithet
of Rudra; see VIII, 29, 5, where Rudra is intended. In II, 33, 7, the
arm of Rudra is called bhesha*g*á*h* gálâsha*h*; in VII, 35, 6, Rudra
himself is called *g*álâsha*h*. *G*álâsha seems connected with *g*ala,
water. Bergaigne, III, 32, translates it by adoucissant.

Note <span id="an_1:43:4:3">3</span>. On *s*a*m*yó*h*, see note 2 to I,
165, 4.

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:43:7:1">1</span>. Tuvi-n*ri*m*n*a would seem more
appropriate as a vocative. In verse 8, too, I should prefer to take Soma
as a vocative, like Benfey and Grassmann.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:43:8:1">1</span>. I read Soma, paribâ´dha*h*. See
Delbrück, Synt. Forsch. p. 116.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:43:9:1">1</span>. Unless we can take mûrdhâ´ for a
locative, attracted by nâ´bhâ, I should propose to read mûrdhán nâ´bhâ.
It can hardly be an adverbial Dvandva, mûrdhâ-nâbhâ, nor do I see how it
can be applied as a nominative to Rudra. The whole verse is difficult,
possibly a later addition. On *ri*tásya am*rí*tasya dhâ´man, see IX, 97,
32; 110, 4 (dhárman).
