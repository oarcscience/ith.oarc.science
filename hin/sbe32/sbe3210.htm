<p>The most powerful instrument that has hitherto been applied to the emendation of Vedic texts, is the metre. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Metrical criticism.</FONT></span>Metre means measure, and uniform measure, and hence its importance for critical purposes, as second only to that of grammar. If our knowledge of the metrical system of the Vedic poets rests on a sound basis, any deviations from the general rule are rightly objected to; and if by a slight alteration they can be removed, and the metre be restored, we naturally feel inclined to adopt such emendations. Two safeguards, however, are needed in this kind of conjectural criticism. We ought to be quite certain that the anomaly is impossible, and we ought to be able to explain to a certain extent</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxviii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxviii</font></A></p>  
<p>how the deviation from the original correct text could have occurred. As this subject has of late years received considerable attention, and as emendations of the Vedic texts, supported by metrical arguments, have been carried on&nbsp;on a very large scale, it becomes absolutely necessary to reexamine the grounds on which these emendations are supposed to rest. There are, in fact, but few hymns in which some verses or some words have not been challenged for metrical reasons, and I feel bound, therefore, at the very beginning of my translation of the Rig-veda, to express my own opinion on this subject, and to give my reasons why in so many cases I allow metrical anomalies to remain which by some of the most learned and ingenious among Vedic scholars would be pronounced intolerable.</p>  
<p>Even if the theory of the ancient metres had not been so carefully worked out by the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khyas and the Anukrama<I>n</I>&icirc;s, an independent study of the Veda would have enabled us to discover the general rules by which the Vedic poets were guided in the composition of their works. Nor would it have been difficult to show how constantly these general principles are violated by the introduction of phonetic changes which in the later Sanskrit are called the euphonic changes of Sandhi, and according to which final vowels must be joined with initial vowels, and final consonants adapted to initial consonants, until at last each sentence becomes a continuous chain of closely linked syllables.</p>  
<p>It is far easier, as I remarked before, to discover the original and natural rhythm of the Vedic hymns by reading them in the Pada than in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text, and after some practice our ear becomes sufficiently schooled to tell us at once how each line ought to be pronounced. We find, on the one hand, that the rules of Sandhi, instead of being generally binding, were treated by the Vedic poets as poetical licences only; and, on the other, that a greater freedom of pronunciation was allowed even in the body of words than would be tolerated in the later Sanskrit. If a syllable was wanted to complete the metre, a semivowel might be pronounced as a vowel, many a long vowel might</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxix"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxix</font></A></p>  
<p>be protracted so as to count for two syllables, and short vowels might be inserted between certain consonants, of which no trace exists in the ordinary Sanskrit. If, on the contrary, there were too many syllables, then the rules of Sandhi were observed, or two short syllables contracted by rapid pronunciation into one; nay, in a few cases, a final m or s, it seems, was omitted. It would be a mistake to suppose that the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khyas were not aware of this freedom allowed or required in the pronunciation of the Vedic hymns. Though they abstained from introducing into the text changes of pronunciation which even we ourselves would never tolerate, if inserted in the texts of Homer and Plautus, in the P&acirc;li verses of Buddha, or even in modern English poetry, the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya were clearly aware that in many places one syllable had to be pronounced as two, or two as one. They were clearly aware that certain vowels, generally considered as long, had to be pronounced as short, and that in order to satisfy the demands of the metre, certain changes of pronunciation were indispensable. They knew all this, but they did not change the text. And this shows that the text, as they describe it, enjoyed even in their time a high authority, that they did not make it, but that, such as it is, with all its incongruities, it had been made before their time. In many cases, no doubt, certain syllables in the hymns of the Veda had been actually lengthened or shortened in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text in accordance with the metre in which they are composed. But this was done by the poets themselves, or, at all events, it was not done by the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya. They simply register such changes, but they do not enjoin them, and in this we, too, should follow their example. It is, therefore, a point of some importance in the critical restoration and proper pronunciation of Vedic texts, that in the rules which we have to follow in order to satisfy the demands of the metre, we should carefully distinguish between what is sanctioned by ancient authority, and what is the result of our own observations. This I shall now proceed to do.</p>  
<p>First, then, the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya distinctly admit</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxx"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxx</font></A></p>  
<p>that, in order to uphold the rules they have themselves laid down, certain syllables are to be pronounced as two syllables. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Vy&ucirc;ha.</FONT></span>We read in S&ucirc;tra 527: 'In a deficient p&acirc;da the right number is to be provided for by protraction of semivowels (which were originally vowels), and of contracted vowels (which were originally two independent vowels).' It is only by this process that the short syllable which has been lengthened in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, viz. the sixth, or the eighth, or the tenth, can be shown to have occupied and to occupy that place where alone, according to a former rule, a short syllable is liable to be lengthened. Thus we read:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I, 161, 11. u&#772;dva&#772;tsv&#773;&#774;a&#773;&#772;sm&acirc;&#772; a&#774;k<i>ri&#774;</i><I>n</I>o&#772;ta&#774;n&acirc;&#772; t<i>ri&#774;</i><I>n</I>am.</div></p>  
<p>This would seem to be a verse of eleven syllables, in which the ninth syllable na has been lengthened. This, however, is against the system of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya. But if we protract the semivowel v in udvatsv, and change it back into u, which it was originally, then we gain one syllable, the whole verse has twelve syllables, na occupies the tenth place, and it now belongs to that class of cases which is included in a former S&ucirc;tra, 523.</p>  
<p>The same applies to X, 103, 13, where we read:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">pr&#773;&#774;e&#773;&#774;t&acirc;&#772; <I>g</I>a&#774;ya&#774;t&acirc;&#772; na&#774;ra&#772;<I>h</I>.</div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> This is a verse of seven syllables, in which the fifth syllable is lengthened, without any authority. Let us protract pret&acirc; by bringing it back to its original component elements pra it&acirc;, and we get a verse of eight syllables, the sixth syllable now falls under the general observation, and is lengthened in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; accordingly.</p>  
<p>The same rules are repeated in a later portion of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya. Here rules had been given as to the number of syllables of which certain metres consist, and it is added (S&ucirc;tras 972, 973) that where that number is deficient, it should be completed by protracting contracted vowels, and by separating consonantal groups in which semivowels (originally vowels) occur, by means of their corresponding vowel.</p>  
<p>The rules in both places are given in almost identically</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxxi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxi</font></A></p>  
<p>the same words, and the only difference between the two passages is this, that, according to the former, semivowels are simply changed back into their vowels, while, according to the latter, the semivowel remains, but is separated from the preceding consonant by its corresponding vowel.</p>  
<p>These rules therefore show clearly that the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, though they would have shrunk from altering one single letter of the authorised Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, recognised the fact that where two vowels had been contracted into one, they might yet be pronounced as two; and where a vowel before another vowel had been changed into a semivowel, it might either be pronounced as a vowel, or as a semivowel preceded by its corresponding vowel. More than these two modifications, however, the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya does not allow, or, at least, does not distinctly sanction. The commentator indeed tries to show that by the wording of the S&ucirc;tras in both places, a third modification is sanctioned, viz. the vocalisation, in the body of a word, of semivowels which do not owe their origin to an original vowel. But in both places this interpretation is purely artificial. Some such rule ought to have been given, but it was not given by the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya. It ought to have been given, for it is only by observing such a rule that in I, 61, 12, go&#772;r na&#774; pa&#773;&#774;rv&#774;a&#774;&#774; vi&#774; ra&#774;d&acirc;&#772; ti&#774;ra&#772;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&acirc;&#774;, we get a verse of eleven syllables, and thus secure for d&acirc; in rad&acirc; the eighth place, where alone the short a could be lengthened. Yet we look in vain for a rule sanctioning the change of semivowels into vowels, except where the semivowels can rightly be called kshaipra-var<I>n</I>a (S&ucirc;tra 974), i.&nbsp;e. semivowels that were originally vowels. The independent (sv&acirc;bh&acirc;vika) semivowels, as e.&nbsp;g. the v in parva, are not included; and to suppose that in S&ucirc;tra 527 these semivowels were indicated by var<I>n</I>a is impossible, particularly if we compare the similar wording of S&ucirc;tra 974&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_46"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxxii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxii</font></A></p>  
<p>We look in vain, too, in the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya for another rule according to which long vowels, even if they do not owe their origin to the coalescence of two vowels, are liable to be protracted. However, this rule, too, though never distinctly sanctioned, is observed in the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, for unless its author observed it, he could not have obtained in the verses quoted by the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya the number of syllables which he ascribes to them. According to S&ucirc;tra 937, the verse, RV. X, 134, 1, is a Mah&acirc;pa&#7749;kti, and consists of six p&acirc;das, of eight syllables each. In order to obtain that number, we must read:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">sa&#772;mr&acirc;&#772;<I>g</I>a&#772;m <I>k</I>a&#772;rsha&#774;<I>n</I>&icirc;&#772;n&acirc;&#773;&#774;m&#773;&#772;.</div></p>  
<p>We may therefore say that, without allowing any actual change in the received text of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya distinctly allows a lengthened pronunciation of certain syllables, which in the Pada text form two syllables; and we may add that, by implication, it allows the same even in cases where the Pada text also gives but one instead of two syllables. Having this authority in our favour, I do not think that we use too much liberty if we extend this modified pronunciation, recognised in so many cases by the ancient scholars of India themselves, to other cases where it seems to us required as well, in order to satisfy the metrical rules of the Veda.</p>  
<p>Secondly, I believe it can be proved that, if not the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, those at least who constituted <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Shortening of long vowels.</FONT></span>the Vedic text which was current in the ancient schools and which we now have before us, were fully aware that certain long vowels and diphthongs could be used as short. The authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya remark that certain changes which can take place before a short syllable only, take place likewise before the word no, although the vowel of this 'no' is by them supposed to be long. After having stated in S&ucirc;tra 523 that the eighth syllable of hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided a short syllable</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxxiii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxiii</font></A></p>  
<p>follows, they remark that for this purpose na<I>h</I> or no is treated as a short syllable:</p>  
<p>X, 59, 4. dyu&#774;-bhi&#772;<I>h</I> hi&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> <I>g</I>a&#774;ri&#774;m&acirc;&#772; su&#774; na&#774;&#770;<I>h</I> a&#772;stu&#772;, (Sa<I>m</I>h. s&ucirc; no astu.)</p>  
<p>Again, in stating that the tenth syllable of hendecasyllabics and dodecasyllabics, if short, is lengthened, provided a short syllable follows, the same exception is understood to be made in favour of na<I>h</I> or no, as a short syllable:</p>  
<p>VII, 48, 4. nu&#774; de&#772;v&acirc;&#772;sa&#772;<I>h</I> va&#774;ri&#774;va&#772;<I>h</I> ka&#772;rta&#774;na&#774; na&#772;<I>h</I>, (Sa<I>m</I>h. ka&#772;rta&#774;n&acirc;&#772; no&#774;, bh&ucirc;ta no, &amp;c.)</p>  
<p>With regard to e being shortened before a short a where, according to rule, the a should be elided, we actually find that the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; gives a instead of e in RV. VIII, 72, 5. v&eacute;ti st&oacute;tave ambya&#771;m, Sa<I>m</I>h. v&eacute;ti st&oacute;tava ambya&#771;m. (Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>. 177, 5.)</p>  
<p>I do not ascribe very much weight to the authority which we may derive from these observations with regard to our own treatment of the diphthongs e and o as either long or short in the Veda, yet in answer to those who are incredulous as to the fact that the vowels e and o could ever be short in Sanskrit, an appeal to the authority of those who constituted our text, and in constituting it clearly treated o as a short vowel, may not be without weight. We may also appeal to the fact that in P&acirc;li and Pr&acirc;k<I>ri</I>t every final o and e can be treated as either long or short&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_47"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>. Starting from this we may certainly extend this observation, as it has been extended by Professor Kuhn, but we must not extend it too far It is quite clear that in the same verse e and o can be used both as long and short. I give the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text:</p>  
<p>I, 84, 17.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">ka &icirc;shate | tu<I>g</I>yate ko&#772; bi&#774;bh&acirc;&#772;ya&#772;<br> ko ma<I>m</I>sate | santam indra&#772;<I>m</I> ko&#774; a&#772;nti&#772;,<br> kas tok&acirc;ya | ka ibh&acirc;yo&#772;ta&#774; r&acirc;&#772;ye&#772;<br> adhi bravat | tanve ko&#772; <I>g</I>a&#774;n&acirc;&#772;ya&#772;.</div></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxxiv"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxiv</font></A></p>  
<p>But although there can be no doubt that e and o, when final, or at the end of the first member of a compound, may be treated in the Veda as anceps, there is no evidence, I believe, to show that the same licence applies to a medial or initial e or o. In IV, 45, 5, we must scan</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">usr&acirc;<I>h</I> <I>g</I>arante prati vasto&#772;<I>h</I> a&#772;<I>s</I>vi&#774;n&acirc;&#772;,</div></p>  
<p>ending the verse with an epitritus tertius instead of the usual dijambus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_48"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Thirdly, the fact that the initial short a, if following upon a word ending in o or e, is frequently not to be elided, is clearly recognised by the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya (see <A HREF="sbe3205.htm#page_xlviii">p. xlviii</A>). Nay, that they wished it to be pronounced even in passages where, in accordance with the requirements of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, it had to disappear in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text, we may conclude from S&ucirc;tra 978. It is there stated that no p&acirc;da should ever begin with a word that has no accent. The exceptions to this rule are few, and they are discussed in S&ucirc;tras 978-987. But if the initial a were not pronounced in I, 1, 9, s&aacute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> pit&acirc;&acute;-iva s&ucirc;n&aacute;ve &aacute;gne su-up&acirc;yan&aacute;<I>h</I> bhava, the second p&acirc;da would begin with <FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>gne, a word which, after the elision of the initial a, would be a word without an accent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_49"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>Fourthly, the fact that other long vowels, besides e and o, may under certain circumstances be used as short in the Veda, is not merely a modern theory, but rests on no less an authority than P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini himself.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxxv"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxv</font></A></p>  
<p>P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini says, VI, I, 127, that i, u, <I>ri</I> (see RV. Bh. IV, 1, 12) at the end of a pada (but not in a compound&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_50"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>) may remain unchanged, if a different vowel follows, and that, if long, they may be shortened. He ascribes this rule, or, more correctly, the first portion of it only, to <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya, Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya 155 seq.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_51"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A> Thus <I>k</I>akr&icirc; atra may become <I>k</I>akri&#774; atra or <I>k</I>akry atra. Madh&ucirc; atra may become madhu&#774; atra or madhv atra. In VI, 1, 128, P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini adds that a, i, u, <I>ri</I> may remain unchanged before <I>ri</I>, and, if long, may be shortened, and this again according to the teaching of <I>S</I>&acirc;kalya, i.&nbsp;e. Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya 136&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_52"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A>. Hence brahm&acirc; <I>ri</I>shi<I>h</I> becomes brahma&#774; <I>ri</I>shi<I>h</I> or brahmarshi<I>h</I>; kum&acirc;r&icirc; <I>ri</I><I>s</I>ya<I>h</I> becomes kum&acirc;ri&#774; <I>ri</I><I>s</I>ya<I>h</I> or kum&acirc;ry <I>ri</I><I>s</I>ya<I>h</I>. This rule enables us to explain a number of passages in which the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text either changes the final long vowel into a semivowel, or leaves it unchanged, when the vowel is a prag<I>ri</I>hya vowel. To the first class belong such passages as I, 163, 12; IV, 38, 10, v&acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;&acute; &aacute;rv&acirc;, Sa<I>m</I>h. v&acirc;<I>g</I>y&aacute;rv&acirc;; VI, 7, 3, v&acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;&acute; agne, Sa<I>m</I>h. v&acirc;<I>g</I>ya&#771;gne; VI, 20, 13, pakth&icirc;&acute; arka&iacute;<I>h</I>, Sa<I>m</I>h. pakthya&#771;rka&iacute;<I>h</I>; IV, 22, 4, <I>s</I>ushm&icirc;&acute; &acirc;&acute; g&oacute;<I>h</I>, Sa<I>m</I>h. <I>s</I>ushmy&acirc;&acute; g&oacute;<I>h</I>. In these passages &icirc; is the termination of a nom. masc. of a stem ending in&nbsp;in. Secondly, IV, 24, 8, p&aacute;tn&icirc; &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, Sa<I>m</I>h. p&aacute;tny&aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a; IV, 34, 1, dev&icirc;&acute; &aacute;hn&acirc;m, Sa<I>m</I>h. devy&aacute;hn&acirc;m; V, 75, 4, v&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>&icirc;<I>k</I>i &acirc;&acute;-hit&acirc;, Sa<I>m</I>h. v&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>&icirc;<I>k</I>y&acirc;&acute;hit&acirc;; VI, 61, 4, avitr&icirc;&acute; avatu, Sa<I>m</I>h. avitrya&#771;vatu. In these passages the &icirc; is the termination of feminines. In X, 15, 4, &ucirc;t&icirc;&acute; arv&acirc;&acute;k, Sa<I>m</I>h. &ucirc;tya&#771;rv&acirc;&acute;k, the final &icirc; of the instrumental &ucirc;t&icirc; ought not to have been changed into a semivowel, for, though not followed by &iacute;ti, it is to be treated as prag<I>ri</I>hya; (Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>. 163, 5.) It is, however,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxxvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxvi</font></A></p>  
<p>mentioned as an exception in S&ucirc;tra 174, 9. The same applies to II, 3, 4, v&eacute;d&icirc; &iacute;ti asy&acirc;&acute;m, Sa<I>m</I>h. v&eacute;dyasy&acirc;&acute;m. The prag<I>ri</I>hya &icirc; ought not to have been changed into a semivowel, but the fact that it had been changed irregularly, was again duly registered in S&ucirc;tra 174, 5. These two prag<I>ri</I>hya &icirc; therefore, which have really to be pronounced short, were irregularly changed in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; into the semivowel; and as this semivowel, like all semivowels, may take vyav&acirc;ya, the same object was attained as if it had been written by a short vowel. With regard to prag<I>ri</I>hya &ucirc;, no such indication is given by the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text; but in such passages as I, 46, 13, <I>s</I>ambh&ucirc; &iacute;ti <I>s</I>am-bh&ucirc; &acirc;&acute; gatam, Sa<I>m</I>h. <I>s</I>ambh&ucirc; &acirc;&acute; gatam; V, 43, 4, b&acirc;h&ucirc;&acute; &iacute;ti &aacute;drim, Sa<I>m</I>h. b&acirc;h&ucirc;&acute; &aacute;drim, the prag<I>ri</I>hya &ucirc; of the dual can be used as short, like the &ucirc; of madh&ucirc; atra, given as an example by the commentators of P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini.</p>  
<p>To Professor Kuhn, I believe, belongs the merit of having extended this rule to final &acirc;. That the &acirc; of the dual may become short, was mentioned in the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, S&ucirc;tra 309, though in none of the passages there mentioned is there any metrical necessity for this shortening (see <A HREF="sbe3205.htm#page_lii">p. lii</A>). This being the case, it is impossible to deny that where this &acirc; is followed by a vowel, and where Sandhi between the two vowels is impossible, the final &acirc; may be treated as short. Whether it must be so treated, depends on the view which we take of the Vedic metres, and will have to be discussed hereafter.</p>  
<p>I agree with Professor Kuhn when he scans:</p>  
<p>VI, 63, 1. kv&#774;a&#774; ty&acirc;&#772; va&#772;lg&ucirc;&#772; pu&#774;ru&#774;-h&ucirc;&#772;t&acirc;&#774; a&#772;dya&#772;, (Sa<I>m</I>h. puru-h&ucirc;t&acirc;dya); and not kv&#774;a&#772; ty&#774;&acirc;&#772; va&#772;lg&ucirc;&#772; pu&#774;ru&#774;h&ucirc;&#772;t&acirc;&#772;dya&#772;, although we might quote other verses as ending with an epitritus primus.</p>  
<p>IV, 3, 13. m&acirc;&#772; ve&#772;<I>s</I>a&#772;sya&#774; pra&#774;-mi&#774;na&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> m&acirc;&#774; &acirc;&#772;pe&#772;<I>h</I>, (Sa<I>m</I>h. m&acirc;pe<I>h</I>,) although the dispondeus is possible.</p>  
<p>I, 77, 1. ka&#774;th&acirc;&#772; d&acirc;&#772;<I>s</I>e&#772;ma&#774; a&#772;gna&#774;ye&#772; k&acirc;&#774; a&#772;smai, (Sa<I>m</I>h. k&acirc;smai.)</p>  
<p>VI, 24, 5. a&#772;rya&#772;<I>h</I> va&#774;<I>s</I>a&#772;sya&#774; pa&#774;ri&#774;-e&#772;t&acirc;&#774; a&#772;sti&#772;.</p>  
<p>Even in a compound like tv&acirc;-&ucirc;ta, I should shorten the first vowel, e.&nbsp;g.</p>  
<p>X, 148, 1. tma&#774;n&acirc;&#772; ta&#774;n&acirc;&#772; sa&#774;nu&#774;y&acirc;&#772;ma&#774; tv&acirc;&#774;-&ucirc;&#772;t&acirc;&#772;<I>h</I>,</p>  
<p>although the passage is not mentioned by the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxxvii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxvii</font></A></p>  
<p>among those where a short final vowel in the eighth place is not lengthened when a short syllable follows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_53"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>But when we come to the second p&acirc;da of a G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, and find there a long &acirc;, and that long &acirc; not followed by a vowel, I cannot agree with Professor Kuhn, that the long &acirc;, even under such circumstances, ought to be shortened. We may scan:</p>  
<p>V, 5, 7. v&acirc;&#772;ta&#772;sya&#774; pa&#772;tma&#774;n &icirc;&#772;<I>l</I>i&#774;t&acirc;&#772; da&#772;ivy&acirc;&#772; ho&#772;t&acirc;&#772;r&acirc;&#772; ma&#774;nu&#774;sha&#772;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The same choriambic ending occurs even in the last p&acirc;da of a G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, and is perfectly free from objection at the end of the other p&acirc;das.</p>  
<p>So, again, we may admit the shortening of au to o in s&acirc;no avye and s&acirc;no avyaye, as quoted in the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, 174 and 177, but this would not justify the shortening of au to av in Anush<I>t</I>ubh verses, such as</p>  
<p>V, 86, 5.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">ma&#772;rt&acirc;&#772;ya&#774; de&#772;v&acirc;u&#772; a&#774;da&#774;bh&acirc;&#772;,<br> a&#772;<I>m</I><I>s</I>&acirc;&#772;-iva&#774; de&#772;v&acirc;&#772;u a&#772;rva&#774;te&#772;,</div></p>  
<p>while, with regard to the Trish<I>t</I>ubh and <I>G</I>agat&icirc; verses, our views on these metres must naturally depend on the difficulties we meet with in carrying them out systematically.</p>  
<p>There is no reason for shortening &acirc; in</p>  
<p>V, 5, 10. de&#772;v&acirc;&#772;n&acirc;&#772;m gu&#772;hy&acirc;&#772; n&acirc;&#772;m&acirc;&#772;ni&#772;.</p>  
<p>It is the second p&acirc;da of a G&acirc;yatr&icirc; here; and we shall see that, even in the third p&acirc;da, four long syllables occur again and again.</p>  
<p>For the same reason I cannot follow Dr. Kuhn in a number of other passages where, for the sake of the metre, he proposes to change a long &acirc; into a short one. Such passages are in the Pada text:</p>  
<p>VI, 46, 11. di&#772;dya&#774;va&#772;<I>h</I> ti&#772;gma&#774;-m&ucirc;&#772;rdh&acirc;&#772;na&#772;<I>h</I>, not m&ucirc;&#772;rdh&acirc;&#774;na&#772;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>I, 15, 6. <i>ri&#774;</i>tu&#774;n&acirc;&#772; ya&#772;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a&#774;m &acirc;&#772;<I>s</I>&acirc;&#772;the&#772;, not &acirc;&#772;<I>s</I>&acirc;&#774;the&#772;.</p>  
<p>V, 66, 2. sa&#772;mya&#774;k a&#774;su&#772;rya&#774;m &acirc;&#772;<I>s</I>&acirc;&#772;te&#772;, not &acirc;&#772;<I>s</I>&acirc;&#774;te&#772;.</p>

<p>V, 41, 1. <i>ri&#774;</i>ta&#772;sya&#774; v&acirc;&#772; sa&#774;da&#774;si&#774; tr&acirc;&#772;s&icirc;&#772;th&acirc;&#772;m na&#772;<I>h</I>, not tr&acirc;&#772;s&icirc;&#774;th&acirc;&#772;m na&#772;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>I must enter the same protest against shortening other long vowels in the following verses which Professor Kuhn proposes to make metrically correct by this remedy:</p>  
<p>I, 42, 6. hi&#774;ra&#772;<I>n</I>ya&#774;v&acirc;&#772;<I>s</I>&icirc;&#772;ma&#772;t-ta&#774;ma&#772;, not v&acirc;&#772;<I>s</I>&icirc;&#774;ma&#772;t-ta&#785;ma&#772;.</p>  
<p>Here the short syllable of ga<I>n</I>a<I>s</I>ri&#774;-bhi<I>h</I> in V, 60, 8, cannot be quoted as a precedent, for the i in ga<I>n</I>a<I>s</I>ri, walking in companies, was never long, and could therefore not be shortened. Still less can we quote n&acirc;ri-bhya<I>h</I> as an instance of a long &icirc; being shortened, for n&acirc;ri-bhya<I>h</I> is derived from n&acirc;ri<I>h</I>, not from n&acirc;r&icirc;, and occurs with a short i even when the metre requires a long syllable; I, 43, 6. n<i>ri&#773;</i>-bhya&#772;<I>h</I> n&acirc;&#772;ri&#774;&#772;-bhy&#774;a&#772;<I>h</I> ga&#774;ve&#772;. The fact is, that in the Rig-veda the forms n&acirc;rishu and n&acirc;r&icirc;-bhya<I>h</I> never occur, but always n&acirc;rishu, n&acirc;ri-bhya<I>h</I>; while from v&acirc;<I>s</I>&icirc; we never find any forms with short i, but always v&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I>&icirc;shu, v&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I>&icirc;-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Nor is there any justification for change in I, 25, 16. g&acirc;&#772;va&#772;<I>h</I> na&#774; ga&#772;vy&ucirc;&#772;t&icirc;&#772;<I>h</I> a&#774;nu&#772;, the second p&acirc;da of a G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. Nor in V, 56, 3. <i>ri&#773;</i>ksha&#772;<I>h</I> na&#774; va&#772;<I>h</I> ma&#774;ru&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> <I>s</I>i&#774;m&icirc;&#772;-v&acirc;&#772;n a&#774;ma&#772;<I>h</I>. In most of the passages mentioned by Professor Kuhn on p. 122, this peculiarity may be observed, that the eighth syllable is short, or, at all events, may be short, when the ninth is long:</p>  
<p>VI, 44, 21. v<i>ri&#773;</i>sh<I>n</I>e&#772; te&#772; i&#772;ndu&#772;<I>h</I> v<i>ri&#774;</i>sha&#774;bha&#774;&nbsp;&#781; p&icirc;&#772;p&acirc;&#772;ya&#772;.</p>  
<p>I, 73, 1. sy&#774;o&#772;na&#774;-<I>s</I>&icirc;&#772;<I>h</I> a&#774;ti&#774;thi&#772;<I>h</I> na&#774;&nbsp;&#781; pr&icirc;&#772;<I>n</I>&acirc;&#772;na&#772;h.</p>  
<p>VII, 13, 1. bha&#774;re&#772; ha&#774;vi&#772;<I>h</I> na&#774; ba&#774;rhi&#774;shi&#774;&nbsp;&#781; ipr&icirc;&#772;<I>n</I>&acirc;&#772;na&#772;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>II, 28, 7. e&#772;na&#772;<I>h</I> k<i>ri&#773;</i><I>n</I>va&#772;nta&#774;m a&#774;su&#774;ra&#774;&nbsp;&#781; bhr&icirc;&#772;<I>n</I>a&#772;nti&#772;.</p>  
<p>Before, however, we can settle the question whether in</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxxxix"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxxxix</font></A></p>  
<p>these and other places certain vowels should be pronounced as either long or short, we must settle the more general <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Metre and Grammar.</FONT></span>question, what authority we have for requiring a long or a short syllable in certain places of the Vedic metres.</p>

M. Regnier was right, Professor Kuhn (Beitr&auml;ge, vol. iv, p. 187) was wrong.

I do not think that in the verses adduced by Professor Kuhn, in which final o is considered by him as an iambus or trochee, this scanning is inevitable. Thus we may scan the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text:</p>

<p>This leaves but one of Professor Kuhn's examples (Beitr&auml;ge, vol. iv, p. 192) unexplained: I, 191, 1. ka&#7749;kato na ka&#7749;kato, where iva for na would remove the difficulty.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_40"></A><A HREF="sbe3210.htm#fr_49">lxxxiv:b</A> This subject, the shortness of e and o in the Veda, has been admirably treated by Mr. Maurice Bloomfield, 'Final as before Sonants,' Baltimore, 1882. Reprinted from the American Journal of Philology, vol. iii, No. 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_41"></A><A HREF="sbe3210.htm#fr_50">lxxxv:a</A> There are certain compounds in which, according to Professor Kuhn, two vowels have been contracted into one short vowel. This is certainly the opinion of Hindu grammarians, also of the compiler of the Pada text. But most of them would admit of another explanation. Thus dh&aacute;nvar<I>n</I>asa<I>h</I>, which is divided into dh&aacute;nva-ar<I>n</I>asa<I>h</I>, may be dh&aacute;nu-ar<I>n</I>asa<I>h</I> (RV. V, 45, 2). Dh&aacute;nar<I>k</I>am, divided into dh&aacute;na-ar<I>k</I>am, may have been dh&aacute;na-<I>ri</I><I>k</I>am (RV. X, 46, 5). <I>S</I>at&aacute;r<I>k</I>asam (RV.
