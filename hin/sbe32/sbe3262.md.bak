### MA*ND*ALA X, HYMN 168.

#### ASH*T*AKA VIII, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 26.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To Vâta</span>.

1\. Now for the greatness of the chariot of Vâta
[1](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:1:1.md)! Its roar goes crashing and thundering.
It moves touching the sky, and creating red sheens
[2](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:1:2.md), or it goes scattering the dust of the
earth.

2\. Afterwards there rise the gusts of Vâta
[1](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:2:1.md), they go towards him, like women to a
feast [2](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:2:2.md). The god goes with them on the same
chariot, he, the king of the whole of this world.

3\. When he moves on his paths along the sky, he rests not even a single
day [1](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:3:1.md); the friend of the waters, the
first-born, the holy, where was he born, whence did he spring?

4\. The breath of the gods, the germ [1](sbe3262.htm#an_10:168:4:1.md) of
the world, that god moves wherever he listeth; his roars indeed are
heard, not his form—let us offer sacrifice to that Vâta!

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Anila Vâtâyana, and addressed to Vâyu, here called Vâta. The
metre is Trish*t*ubh. This hymn does not occur in the other Vedas. See
Muir, Sanskrit Texts, V, p. 145; Geldner and Kaegi, p. 95.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_10:168:1:1">1</span>. For this use of the accusative,
see Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 13.

Note <span id="an_10:168:1:2">2</span>. Aru*n*âni is explained by
Geldner, Ved. Stud. p. 274, as the reddish colours of the lightning.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_10:168:2:1">1</span>. Vish*th*â means kind or variety.
Anu seems to refer to ratha, which I take as the subject of the whole of
the first verse.

Note <span id="an_10:168:2:2">2</span>. 'Sie gehn mit einander zum
Tanz,' Geldner and Kaegi.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_10:168:3:1">1</span>. Geldner and Kaegi propose aha
for aha*h*.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_10:168:4:1">1</span>. Vâta seems to be called the
garbha of the world, in the sense of being its source or life.
