If these arguments are sound, and if nothing can be said against the
critical principles by which I have been guided <span
class="margnote">Aufrecht's mistakes.</span>in editing the text of the
Rig-veda, if the fourfold check, described above, fulfils every
requirement that could be made for restoring that text which was known
to Sâya*n*a, and which was known, probably 2000 years earlier, to the
authors of the Prâti*s*âkhyas, what can be the motives, it may fairly be
asked, of those who clamour for a new and more critical edition, and who
imagine that the editio princeps of the Rig-veda will share the fate of
most of the editiones principes of the Greek and Roman classics, and be
supplanted by new editions founded on the collation of other MSS.? No
one could have rejoiced more sincerely than I did at the publication of
the Romanised transliteration of the Rig-veda, carried out with so much
patience and accuracy by Professor Aufrecht. It showed that there was a
growing interest in this, the only true Veda; it showed that even those
who could not read Sanskrit in the original Devânagarî, wished to have
access to the original text of these ancient hymns; it showed that the
study of the Veda had a future before it like no other book of Sanskrit
literature. My learned friend Professor Aufrecht has been most unfairly
charged with having printed this Romanised text me insciente vel invito.
My edition is publici juris, like any edition of Homer or Plato, and
anybody might, with proper acknowledgment, have reprinted it, either in
Roman or Devânagarî letters. But far from keeping me in ignorance of his
plan, Professor Aufrecht applied to me for the loan of the MSS. of the
two Ma*nd*alas which I had not yet published, and I lent them to him
most gladly, because, by seeing them printed at once, I felt far less

<span id="page_liv">p. liv</span>

guilty in delaying the publication of the last volumes of my edition of
the text and commentary. Nor could anything have been more honourable
than the way in which Professor Aufrecht speaks of the true relation of
his Romanised text to my edition. That there are misprints, and I,
speaking for myself, ought to say mistakes also, in my edition of the
Rig-veda, I know but too well; and if Professor Aufrecht, after
carefully transcribing every word, could honestly say that their number
is small, I doubt whether other scholars will be able to prove that
their number is large. I believe I may with the same honesty return
Professor Aufrecht's compliment, and considering the great difficulty of
avoiding misprints in Romanised transcripts, I have always thought and I
have always said that his reprint of the hymns of the Veda is remarkably
correct and accurate. What, however, I must protest against, and what, I
feel sure, Professor Aufrecht himself would equally protest against, is
the supposition, and more than supposition of certain scholars, that
wherever this later Latin transcript differs from my own Devânagarî
text, Professor Aufrecht is right, and I am wrong; that his various
readings rest on the authority of new MSS., and constitute in fact a new
recension of the Vedic hymns. Against this supposition I must protest
most strongly, not for my own sake, but for the sake of the old book,
and, still more, for the sake of the truth. No doubt it is natural to
suppose that where a later edition differs from a former edition, it
does so intentionally; and I do not complain of those who, without being
able to have recourse to MSS. in order to test the authority of various
readings, concluded that wherever the new text differed from the old, it
was because the old text was at fault. In order to satisfy my own
conscience on this point, I have collated a number of passages where
Professor Aufrecht's text differs from my own, and I feel satisfied that
in the vast majority of cases, I am right and he is wrong, and that his
variations do not rest on the authority of MSS. I must not shrink from
the duty of making good this assertion, and I therefore proceed to an
examination of such passages as have occurred to me on

<span id="page_lv">p. lv</span>

occasionally referring to his text, pointing out the readings both where
he is right, and where he is wrong. The differences between the two
texts may appear trifling, but I shall not avail myself of that plea. On
the contrary, I quite agree with those scholars who hold that in truly
critical scholarship there is nothing trifling. Besides, it is in the
nature of the case that what may, by a stretch of the word, be called
various readings in the Veda, must be confined to single letters or
accents, and can but seldom extend to whole words, and never to whole
sentences. I must therefore beg my readers to have patience while I
endeavour to show that the text of the Rig-veda, as first published by
me, though by no means faultless, was nevertheless not edited in so
perfunctory a manner as some learned critics seem to suppose, and that
it will not be easy to supplant it either by a collation of new MSS.,
such as are accessible at present, or by occasional references to the
Prâti*s*âkhya.
