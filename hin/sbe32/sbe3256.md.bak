### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 114.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 5-6.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To Rudra</span>.

1\. We offer these prayers [1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:1:1.md) to Rudra, the
strong, whose hair is braided [2](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:1:2.md), who rules
over heroes [3](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:1:3.md), that he may be a blessing to
man and beast, that everything in this our village may be prosperous and
free from disease.

2\. Be gracious to us, O Rudra, and give us joy, and we shall honour
thee, the ruler of heroes, with worship. What health and wealth father
Manu acquired by his sacrifices, may we obtain the same, O Rudra, under
thy guidance.

3\. O bounteous Rudra, may we by sacrifice obtain the goodwill of thee,
the ruler of heroes; come to our clans, well-disposed, and, with
unharmed men, we shall offer our libation to thee.

4\. We call down for our help the fierce Rudra, who fulfils our
sacrifice, the swift, the wise; may he drive far away from us the anger
of the gods; we desire his goodwill only.

5\. We call down with worship the red boar of the sky, the god with
braided hair, the blazing form; may he who carries in his hand the best
medicines grant us protection, shield, and shelter!

6\. This speech is spoken for the father of the Maruts, sweeter than
sweet, a joy [1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:6:1.md) to Rudra; grant to us also, O
immortal, the food of mortals, be gracious to us and to our kith and
kin!

7\. Do not slay our great or our small ones, our

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

growing or our grown ones, our father or our mother and do not hurt our
own [1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:7:1.md) bodies, O Rudra!

8\. O Rudra, hurt us not in our kith and kin, nor in our own life, not
in our cows, nor in our horses! Do not slay our men in thy wrath:
carrying libations, we call on thee always.

9\. Like a shepherd [1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:9:1.md), I have driven these
praises near to thee; O father of the Maruts, grant us thy favour! For
thy goodwill is auspicious, and most gracious, hence we desire thy
protection alone.

10\. Let thy cow-slaying and thy man-slaying be far away
[1](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:10:1.md), and let thy favour be with us, O ruler
of heroes! Be gracious to us, and bless us, O god, and then give us
twofold protection [2](sbe3256.htm#an_1:114:10:2.md).

11\. We have uttered our supplication to him, desiring his help; may
Rudra with the Maruts hear our call. May Mitra, Varu*n*a, Aditi, the
River, Earth, and the Sky grant us this!

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Kutsa Âṅgirasa. Metre, 1-9 *G*agatî; 10, 11 Trish*t*ubh.
Verse 1 = VS. XVI, 48; TS. IV, 5, 10, 1; MS. II, 9, 9 (yáthâ na*h*
*s*ám); verse 2 = TS. IV, 5, 10, 2; verse 7 = VS. XVI, 15; TS. IV, 5,
10, 2; verse 8 = VS. XVI, 16; TS. III, 4, 11, 2; IV, 5, 10, 3; MS. IV,
12, 6 (â´yushi; havíshmanto námasâ vidhema te); verse 10 = TS. IV, 5,
10, 3.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:114:1:1">1</span>. TS. reads imâ´m matím, and yáthâ
na*h* *s*ám.

Note <span id="an_1:114:1:2">2</span>. Kapardin is an epithet not only
of Rudra, but also of Pûshan (VI, 55, 2; IX, 67, II), and of a Vedic
clan, the T*ri*tsus (VII, 83, 8) or Vasish*th*as; see Roth, Zur
Literatur and Geschichte des Weda, pp. 94 seq.; Oldenberg, Z. D. M. G.
XLII, p. 207. Kaparda is the name of a shell, and the hair twisted
together in the form of a shell seems to have suggested the name of
kapardin.

Note <span id="an_1:114:1:3">3</span>. Kshayád-vîra means 'ruling over
heroes,' just as mandád-vîra (VIII, 69, 1) means 'delighting heroes.'
This meaning is applicable to all passages where kshayád-vîra occurs,
and there is no reason why we should translate it by 'destroyer of
heroes,' which can hardly be considered as an epitheton ornans. No
doubt, a god who rules and protects can also be conceived as punishing
and destroying, and this is particularly the case with Rudra. Hence in
certain passages Rudra may well be invoked as n*ri*hán (IV 3, 6), just
as we read of the Maruts (VII, 56, 17): 'May that bolt of yours which
kills cattle and men be far from us! Incline to us, O Vasu, with your
favours!' See Muir, S*T*. IV, p. 301, note.

##### Verse 2.

TS. reads âya*g*é and prá*n*îtau. See Ludwig, Notes, p. 265.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:114:6:1">1</span>. On the meaning of vardhana and
v*ri*dh in Zend, see Darmesteter, Ormazd, pp. 41, 6; 92, 1.

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:114:7:1">1</span>. TS. reads priyâ´ mâ´ nas
tanúva*h* rudra rîrisha*h*. Priya, dear, used like φίλος, in the sense
of our own. See Bergaigne, III, 152.

##### Verse 8.

See Colebrooke, Misc. Ess. I, p. 141 (ed. 1837); and *S*vetâ*s*vat. Up.
in S. B. E. XV, p. 254, note. Â´yushi for âyaú is supported by VS. and
TS. I propose to read â´yau for âyaú. Bhâmitá*h* is supported by TS. and
*S*vet. Up., while VS. reads bhâmína*h*, which Mahidhara refers to
vîrâ´n. The last line is the same in RV. and VS., but the TS. reads
havíshmanto námasâ vidhema te, while the *S*vet. Up. reads
havishmanta*h* sadasi tvâ havâmahe.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:114:9:1">1</span>. As to the simile, see RV. X, 127,
8, and Muir S*T*. IV, p. 304, note.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:114:10:1">1</span>. TS. reads drat te, goghná (°é),
purushaghné, kshayádvîrâya, rákshâ for m*ril*â´, deva brûhi.

Note <span id="an_1:114:10:2">2</span>. I take dvibárhâ*h*, which stands
for dvibárha*h*, as an adjective to *s*árma, or possibly as an adverb,
see Lanman, p. 560. It can hardly refer to Rudra, as Grassmann supposes.
See J. Schmidt, Pluralbildungen der Neutra, pp. 132 seq.
