# VEDIC HYMNS.

### MA*ND*ALA X, HYMN 121.

### ASH*T*AKA VIII, ADHYÂYA 7, VARGA 3-4.

#### <span class="smallcaps"></span>.

1\. In the beginning there arose the Golden Child (Hira*n*ya-garbha
[1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:1:1)); as soon as born, he alone was the lord
of all that is. He stablished the earth and this heaven:—Who is the God
to whom we shall offer sacrifice?

2\. He who gives breath, he who gives strength, whose
[1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:2:1) command all the bright gods revere, whose
shadow [2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:2:2) is immortality, whose shadow is
death:—Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?

3\. He who through his might became the sole king of the breathing and
twinkling [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:3:1) world, who governs all this,
man and beast:—Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?

4\. He through whose might [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:4:1) these snowy
mountains are, and the sea, they say, with the distant river (the Rasâ
[2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:4:2)), he of whom these regions are indeed the
two arms:—Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?

5\. He through whom the awful heaven and the earth were made fast
[1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:5:1), he through whom the ether was
stablished, and the firmament; he who measured the air in the sky
[2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:5:2):—Who is the God to whom we shall offer
sacrifice?

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

6\. He to whom heaven and earth [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:6:1), standing
firm by his will, look up, trembling in their mind; he over whom the
risen sun shines forth:—Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?

7\. When the great waters [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:7:1) went
everywhere, holding the germ (Hira*n*ya-garbha), and generating light,
then there arose from them the (sole [2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:7:2))
breath of the gods:—Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?

8\. He who by his might looked even over the waters which held power
(the germ) and generated the sacrifice (light
[1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:8:1)), he who alone is God above all gods
[2](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:8:2):—Who is the God to whom we shall offer
sacrifice?

9\. May he not hurt us, he who is the begetter of the earth, or he, the
righteous, who begat the heaven; he who also begat the bright and mighty
waters:—Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?

\[10 [1](sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:10:1). Pra*g*âpati, no other than thou
embraces all these created things. May that be ours which we desire when
sacrificing to thee: may we be lords of wealth!\]

#### NOTES.

This hymn is ascribed to Hira*n*yagarbha Prâ*g*âpatya, and is supposed
to be addressed to Ka, Who, i. e. the Unknown God.

First translated in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 1859, p.
569; see also Hibbert Lectures; 1882, p. 301; Muir, Original Sanskrit
Texts, IV, p. 15.

Verse 1 = VS. XIII, 4; XXIII, 1; XXV, 10; TS. IV, 1, 8, 3; 2, 8, 2; AV.
IV, 2, 7.

Verse 2 = VS. XXV, 13; TS. IV, 1, 8, 4; VII, 5, 17, 1; AV. IV, 2, I;
XIII, 3, 24.

Verse 3 = VS. XXIII, 3; XXV, 11; TS. IV, 1, 8, 4; VII, 5, 16, 1; AV. IV,
2, 2.

Verse 4 = VS. XXV, 12; TS. IV, 1, 8, 4; AV. IV, 2, 5.

Verse 5 = VS. XXXII, 6; TS. IV, 1, 8, 5; AV. IV, 2, 4.

Verse 6 = VS. XXXII, 7; TS. IV, 1, 8, 5; AV. IV, 2, 3.

Verse 7 = VS. XXVII, 25; XXXII, 7; TS. II, 2, 12, 1; IV, 1, 8, 5; TA. I,
23, 8; AV. IV, 2, 6.

Verse 8 = VS. XXVII, 26; XXXII. 7; TS. IV, 1, 8, 6.

Verse 9 = VS. XII, 102; TS. IV, 2, 7, 1.

Verse 10 = VS. X, 20; XXIII, 65; TS. I, 8, 14, 2; III, 2, 5, 6; TB. II,
8, 1, 2; III, 5, 7, 1; AV. VII, 79, 4; 80, 3.

This is one of the hymns which has always been suspected as modern by
European interpreters. The reason is clear. To us the conception of one
God, which pervades the whole of this hymn, seems later than the
conception of many individual gods, as recognised in various aspects of
nature, such as the gods of the sky, the sun, the storms, or the fire.
And in a certain sense we may be right, and language also confirms our
sentiment. In our hymn there are several words which do not occur again
in the Rig-veda, or which occur in places only which have likewise been
suspected to be of more modern date. Hira*n*yagarbha

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

itself is an ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. Sám avartata is found only in the last
Ma*nd*ala, X, 90, 14; 129, 4. Bhûtá also, in the sense of what is,
occurs in the tenth Ma*nd*ala only. It is used three times (X, 55, 2;
58, 12; 90, 2) as opposed to bhávya, i. e. what is and what will be; and
once more in the sense of all that is (X, 85, 17). Âtmadâ´*h*, in the
sense of giving life, is another ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. Pra*s*ísh is restricted
to Ma*nd*alas I (I, 145, 1), IX (IX, 66, 6; 86, 32), and our passage.
Himávat, ἅπαξ λεγόμενον. The repetition of the relative pronoun in
verses 2 and 4 is unusual. In the tenth verse the compound yat-kâma*h*
is modern, and the insertion of etâ´ni between tvat and anyá*h* is at
all events exceptional. The passage V, 31, 2 is not parallel, because in
tvát indra vásya*h* anyát, the ablative tvát is governed by vásya*h*. In
VI, 21, 10, ná tvâ´vân anyá*h* am*ri*ta tvat asti, anyá*h* is separated
from tvát by a vocative only, as in VIII, 24, 11.

But when we say that a certain hymn is modern, we must carefully
consider what we mean. Our hymn, for instance, must have existed not
only previous to the Brâhma*n*a period, for many Brâhma*n*as presuppose
it, but previous to the Mantra period also. It is true that no verse of
it occurs in the Sâma-veda, but in the Sâma-veda-brâhma*n*a IX, 9, 12,
verse 1 at least is mentioned <span id="fr_76"></span>[a](#fn_67). Most
of its verses, however, occur in the Vâ*g*asaneyi-sa*m*hitâ, in the
Taittirîya-sa*m*hitâ, and in the Atharva-veda-sa*m*hitâ, nay, the last
verse, to my mind the most suspicious of all, occurs most frequently in
the other Sa*m*hitâs and Brâhma*n*as.

But though most of the verses of our hymn occur in other Sa*m*hitâs,
they do not always occur in the same order.

In the Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. we have the first verse in XIII, 4, but no other
verse of our hymn follows. We have the first verse again in XXIII, 1,
but not followed by verse 2, but by verse 3 (XXIII, 3) <span
id="fr_77"></span>[b](#fn_68). Then we have verse 1 once more

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

in XXV, 10, followed by verse 3 (XXV, 11), by verse 4 (XXV, 12), and
then by verse 2 (XXV, 13).

We have verses 5, 6, 7, 8 in VS. XXXII, 6 and 7, and verses 7 and 8 in
VS. XXVII, 25 and 26, while verse 9 is found in XII, 102 only <span
id="fr_78"></span>[a](#fn_69), and the last verse in X, 20 <span
id="fr_79"></span>[b](#fn_70), and XXIII, 65.

In the Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ the verses follow more regularly, still never
quite in the same order as in the Rig-veda. In TS. IV, 1, 8, 3 <span
id="fr_80"></span>[c](#fn_71) we have verses 1 to 8, but verse 3 before
verse 2, and verse 6 before verse 5, while verse 9 follows in IV, 2, 7,
1.

In TS. v. 3 stands before v. 2, in VII, 5, 16, 1, and VII, 5, 17, 1.

In TS. II, 2, 12, the pratîkas of verses 1, 7, 10 are quoted in
succession.

Verse 7 occurs with important various readings in TA. I, 23, 8, â´po ha
yád b*ri*hatî´r gárbham â´yan dáksha*m* dádhânâ ganáyantî*h* svayambhúm,
táta imé<sup>ऽ</sup>dhyásri*g*yanta sárgâ*h*.

Lastly in the AV. we find verses 1 to 7 from IV, 2, 1, to IV, 2, 7, but
arranged in a different order, viz. as 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 1, and with
important various readings.

Verse 2, yô´ 3 syé*s*e dvipádo yá*s* *k*átushpada*h*, as third pâda;
also in XIII, 3, 24.

Verse 3, ekó râ´*g*â; yásya *kh*âyâ´m*rí*ta*m* yásya m*ri*tyú*h*, as
third pâda.

Verse 4, yásya ví*s*ve; samudré yásya rasâ´m íd âhú*h*; imâ´*sk*a.

Verse 5, yásya dyaúr urvî´ p*ri*thivî´ *k*a mahî´ yásyâdá
urvámtáriksham, yásyâsaú sû´ro vítato mahitvâ´.

Verse 6, ávata*s* *k*askabhâné bhiyásâne ródasî áhvayethâm (sic),
yásyâsaú panthâ´ rá*g*aso vimâna*h*.

Verse 7, â´po ágre ví*s*vam âván gárbha*m* dádhânâ am*rí*tâ
*ri*ta*gñ*â´*h*, yâ´su devî´shv ádhi devá âsît.

Verse 10, vî´*s*vâ rûpâ´*n*i paribhur *g*agâna, see VII, 79, 4, and 80,
3.

We are justified, therefore, in looking upon the verses, composing this
hymn, as existing before the

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

final arrangement of the four Sa*m*hitâs, and if we persist in calling a
hymn, dating from that period, a modern hymn, we must make it quite
clear that, according to the present state of our knowledge, such a hymn
cannot well be more modern than 1000 <span class="smallcaps">b.c.</span>
Besides the variations in the arrangement of the verses of our hymn, the
very considerable various readings which we find in the VS., TS., and
AV. are highly instructive, as showing the frequent employment of our
hymn for sacrificial purposes. In several cases these various readings
are of great importance, as we shall see.

##### Verse 1.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: Hira*n*yagarbha arose in the
beginning; born, he was the one lord of things existing. He established
the earth and this sky: to what god shall we offer our oblation?

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Hira*n*yagarbha hat zuerst sich
gebildet, er ward geboren als einziger herr alles gewordenen, dise erde
and disen himel hält er; Ka, dem gotte, möchten wir mit havis aufwarten.

Note <span id="an_10:121:1:1">1</span>. Hira*n*yagarbha <span
id="fr_81"></span>[a](#fn_72) has been translated in different ways, and
it would perhaps be best to keep it as a proper name, which it is in
later times. It means literally the golden embryo, the golden germ or
child, or born of a golden womb, and was no doubt an attempt at naming
the sun. Soon, however, that name became mythological. The golden child
was supposed to have been so called because it was Pra*g*âpati, the lord
of creation, when dwelling as yet in the golden egg, and Hira*n*yagarbha
became in the end a recognised name of Pra*g*âpati, see Say. on X, 121,
1. All this is fully explained by Sâya*n*a, TS. IV, 1, 8, 3; IV, 2, 8,
2; by Mahîdhara, VS. XIII, 4.

##### Verse 2.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: He who gives breath, who gives
strength, whose command all, \[even\] the gods, reverence, whose shadow
is immortality, whose shadow is death: to what god shall we offer our
oblation?

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Geber des lebendigen hauches,
geber der kraft, zu des unterweisung alle Otter sich einfinden, des
glanz die unsterblichkeit, dessen der tod ist, Ka, dem gotte, möchten
wir mit havis aufwarten.

Note <span id="an_10:121:2:1">1</span>. In order to account for the
repetition of yasya, Sâya*n*a and Mahidhara take vi*s*ve for men, and
devâ*h* for gods.

Note <span id="an_10:121:2:2">2</span>. It is difficult to say what is
meant by *kh*âyâ, shadow. I take it in the sense of what belongs to the
god, as the shadow belongs to a man, what follows him, or is determined
by him. In that sense Sâya*n*a also takes it, TS. IV, 1, 8, 4, yasya
pra*g*âpate*s* *kh*âyâvat svâdhînam am*ri*tam, moksharûpam, m*ri*tyu*h*,
prâ*n*inâm mara*n*am api, yasya *kh*âyeva svâdhina*h*; and, though not
quite so clearly, in RV. X, 121, 2. Mahîdhara on the contrary takes
*kh*âyâ in the sense of refuge, and says, whose shadow, i. e. whose
worship, preceded by knowledge, is am*ri*ta, immortality, a means of
deliverance <span id="fr_82"></span>[a](#fn_73), while ignorance of him
is death, or leads to sa*m*sâra.

##### Verse 3.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: Who by his might became the sole
king of the breathing and winking world, who is the lord of this
two-footed and four-footed \[creation\]: to what god shall we offer our
oblation?

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Der des atmenden, augenbewegenden
lebendigen durch seine grösze der einzige könig geworden; der verfügt
über disz zwei- und vier-füszige, Ka, dem gotte, möchten wir mit havis
aufwarten.

Note <span id="an_10:121:3:1">1</span>. It is difficult to say whether
nimishata*h* means twinkling or sleeping. It has both meanings as to
wink has in English. Sâya*n*a (X, 121, 3; TS. IV, 1, 8, 4) and Mahidhara
(VS. XXIII, 3 <span id="fr_83"></span>[b](#fn_74)) explain it by
winking. This may be right as expressing sensuous perception, in
addition to mere breathing. In X, 190, 2, ví*s*vasya misható va*s*î´
means, lord of all that winks, i. e.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

lives. The later idea, that the gods do not wink, has nothing to do with
our passage.

##### Verse 4.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: Whose greatness these snowy
mountains, and the sea with the Rasâ (river), declare,—of whom these
regions, of whom they are the arms: to what god shall we offer our
oblation?

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Dessen die schneebedeckten
(berge, die Himavân) vermöge seiner grösze, als des eigentum man ocean
und Rasâ nennt, des dise himelsgegenden, des arme sie, Ka, dem gotte,
möchten wir mit havis aufwarten.

Note <span id="an_10:121:4:1">1</span>. Muir's translation, which
suggests itself very naturally to a European mind, is impossible,
because mahitvâ´ cannot be either mahitvám (as Sâya*n*a also and
Mahîdhara suggest), or mahitvâ´ni; and because âhú*h* does not mean
declare. Otherwise nothing could be better than his rendering: 'Whose
greatness these snowy mountains, and the sea with the Rasâ (river),
declare.'

Mahitvâ´, as Sâya*n*a also rightly perceives, TS. IV, 1, 8, 4, is a very
common instrumental (see Lanman, Noun-inflection, pp. 335-6), and the
same mahitvâ´ must be supplied for samudrá*m*. We might make the whole
sentence dependent on âhu*h* without much change of meaning. The
Atharva-veda text supplies a lectio facilior, but not therefore melior.

Note <span id="an_10:121:4:2">2</span>. The Rasâ is a distant river, in
some respects like the Greek Okeanos. Dr. Aufrecht takes it as a name of
the milky way, Z. D. M. G. XIII, 498: see Muir, S. T. II, p. 373, n. 19.

##### Verse 5.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: By whom the sky is fiery, and the
earth fixed, by whom the firmament and the heaven were established, who
in the atmosphere is the measurer of the aerial space: to what god shall
we offer our oblation?

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Durch den gewaltig der himel and
fest die erde, durch den gestützt Svar, and das gewölbe, der die räume
im mittelgebiete ausgemeszen, Ka, dem gotte, möchten wir mit havis
aufwarten.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

Note <span id="an_10:121:5:1">1</span>. In this verse I decidedly prefer
the reading of the Atharva-veda, yena dyaur ugrâ p*ri*thivî ka d*rilh*e.
It seems not a lectio facilior, and we avoid the statement that the
heaven has been made ugrâ. Ugrâ, as applied to dyaus, means awful and
grand, as an inherent quality rather, and not simply strong. See Ludwig,
Notes, p. 441.

Note <span id="an_10:121:5:2">2</span>. Rá*g*aso vimâ´na*h* has been
fully discussed by Muir, S. T. IV, p. 71, but it is difficult to find a
right translation for it, because the cosmography of the Veda is so
different from our own (see I, 6, 9, note 1, and I, 19, 3, note 1). I
think we may translate it here by the air, or even by space,
particularly the bright air in the sky, the sky (antariksha or nabhas)
being between heaven (dyu) and earth (p*ri*thivî), while sva*h* and nâka
are still higher than the heaven (dyu), sva*h* being sometimes explained
as the abode of the sun, the ether, or empyrean, nâka, the firmament, as
svarga (Mahîdhara); or sva*h* as svarga, and nâka as âditya (Sâya*n*a).
Vimâna is here simply the measurer, though vimâ, from meaning to
measure, is apt to take the meaning of to make, which is an excuse for
Sâya*n*a's rendering, 'who makes the rain in the sky.'

The Atharva-veda rendering is very free, and certainly no improvement.

##### Verse 8.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: To whom two contending armies,
sustained by his succour, looked up, trembling in mind; over whom the
risen sun shines: to what god shall we offer our oblation?

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Auf den die beiden schlachtreihen
durch (ihre) begirde aufgestellt in ordnung ihren blick richten,
zitternd, im geiste, wo darû´ber hin aufgegangen Sûra ausstralt, Ka, dem
gotte, möchten wir mit havis aufwarten.

Note <span id="an_10:121:6:1">1</span>. It would be well to read ródasî
for krándasî (which B. R. explain by 'two armies'), and the various
reading in AV. IV, 2, 3 decidedly points in that direction. But even if
krándasî stands, it must be taken in the same sense as ródasî. Uditau
vyeti in TS. IV, 1, 8, 5 is explained by udayavishaye vividha*m*
ga*kkh*ati.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

##### Verse 7.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: When the great waters pervaded the
universe containing an embryo, and generating fire, thence arose the one
spirit (asu) of the gods: to what god shall we offer our oblation?

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Als die groszen waszer kamen, die
allen keim in sich faszten, zeugend den Agni, da kam zu Stande der
götter einziger lebensgeist; Ka, dem gotte, möchten wir mit havis
aufwarten.

Note <span id="an_10:121:7:1">1</span>. The waters here referred to have
to be understood as the waters in the beginning of the creation, where,
as we read (RV. X, 129, 3), 'everything was like a sea without a light,'
or, as the *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a (XI, 1, 6, 1) says, 'everything was
water and sea.' These waters held the germ <span
id="fr_84"></span>[a](#fn_75), and produced the golden light, the
sun <span id="fr_85"></span>[b](#fn_76), whence arose the life of all
the gods, viz. Pra*g*âpati. The Atharva-veda adds a verse which repeats
the same idea more clearly: â´po vatsá*m* *g*anáyantîr gárbham ágre
sámairayan, tásyotá *g*â´yamânasyólba âsîd dhira*n*yáya*h*, 'In the
beginning the waters, producing a young, brought forth an embryo, and
when it was being born, it had a golden covering.' The sunrise serves
here as elsewhere as an image of the creation.

Note <span id="an_10:121:7:2">2</span>. Grassmann proposes to omit eka,
because it is absent in the Maitrâya*n*î *S*âkhâ. The metre shows the
same.

##### Verse 8.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: He who through his greatness beheld
the waters which contained power, and generated sacrifice, who was the
one god above the gods: to what god shall we offer our oblation?

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Der in seiner grösze sogar die
waszer überschaute, wie sie die fähigkeit besitzend erzeugten das opfer,
der der einzige gott war über den göttern, Ka, dem gotte, möchten wir
mit havis aufwarten.

Note <span id="an_10:121:8:1">1</span>. In dáksha*m* dádhânâ
*g*anáyantîr ya*gñ*ám, we have a repetition of what was said in the
preceding verse,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

dáksham standing for gárbham, ya*gñ*am for agním, which is actually the
reading of TS. The Atharva-veda does not contain this verse, which is
used as an anyâ vikalpitâ yâ*g*yâ in TS.

Note <span id="an_10:121:8:2">2</span>. It is curious that one of the
most important sentences in the Rig-veda, yo deveshv adhi deva eka âsît,
should have been changed in the Atharva-veda IV, 2, 6 into yâsu devîshv
adhi deva âsît, 'over which divine waters there was the god.' See
Ludwig, Notes, p. 441.

##### Verse 9.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: May he not injure us, he who is the
generator of the earth, who, ruling by fixed ordinances, produced the
heavens, who produced the great and brilliant waters: to what god shall
we offer our oblation?

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Nicht schädige uns, der der erde
erzeuger, oder der den himel bereitet mit warhafter satzung, der auch
die wasser, die hellen, die mächtigen erzeugt hat, Ka, dem gotte,
mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.

##### Verse 10.

<span class="smallcaps">Muir</span>: Pra*g*âpati, no other than thou is
lord over all these created things: may we obtain that, through desire
of which we have invoked thee: may we become masters of riches.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Pra*g*âpati, kein anderer als du
hat umfasst die wesen alle, der wunsch, um deswillen wir dir opfern, der
werde uns zu teil, besitzer von reichtümern mögen wir sein.

Note <span id="an_10:121:10:1">1</span>. This verse is certainly
extremely weak after all that preceded, still, to judge from its
frequent occurrence, we cannot well discard it. All we can say is that
nowhere, except in the Rig-veda, does it form the final verse of our
hymn, and thus spoil its whole character.

That character consists chiefly in the burden of the nine verses, Kasmai
devâya havishâ vidhema, 'To what god shall we offer sacrifice?' This is
clearly meant to express a desire of finding out the true, but unknown
god, and to do so, even after all has been said that can be said of a
supreme god. To finish such a hymn with a statement

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

that Pra*g*âpati is the god who deserves our sacrifice, may be very
natural theologically, but it is entirely uncalled for poetically. The
very phrase Kasmai devâya havishâ vidhema must have been a familiar
phrase, for we find in a hymn-addressed to the wind, X, 168, 4, after
all has been said that can be said of him, the concluding line:
ghóshâ*h* it asya *srin*vire ná rûpám tásmai vâ´tâya havíshâ vidhema,
'his sound indeed is heard, but he is not seen—to that Vâta let us offer
sacrifice.'

But more than this, on the strength of hymns like our own in which the
interrogative pronoun ka, 'who,' occurs, the Brâhmans actually invented
a god of the name of Ka. I pointed this out many years ago in my History
of Ancient Sanskrit Literature (1860, p. 433), where I said: In
accordance with the same system, we find that the authors of the
Brâhma*n*as had so completely broken with the past that, forgetful of
the poetical character of the hymns, and the yearning of the poets after
the unknown god, they exalted the interrogative pronoun into a deity,'
and acknowledged a god 'Ka, or Who.' In the Taittirîya-sa*m*hitâ (I, 7,
6, 6), in the Kaushîtaki-brâhma*n*a (XXIV, 4), in the
Tâ*nd*ya-brâhma*n*a (XV, 10), and in the Satapatha-brâhma*n*a <span
id="fr_86"></span>[a](#fn_77), whenever interrogative verses occur, the
author states, that Ka is Pra*g*âpati, or 'the Lord of Creatures'
(Pra*g*âpatir vai Ka*h*). Nor did they stop there. Some of the hymns in
which the interrogative pronoun occurred were called Kadvat, i. e.
having kad or quid. But soon a new adjective was formed, and not only
the hymns, but the sacrifices also, offered to the god, were called
Kâya, or who-ish <span id="fr_87"></span>[b](#fn_78). This word, which
is not to be identified with the Latin cujus, cuja, cujum, but is merely
the artificial product of an effete mind, is found in the
Taittirîya-sa*m*hitâ (I, 8, 3, 1), and in the Vâ*g*asaneyi-sa*m*hitâ
(XXIV, 15). At the time of Pâ*n*ini

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

this word had acquired such legitimacy as to call for a separate rule
explaining its formation (Pâ*n*. IV, 2, 25). The commentator there
explains Ka by Brahman. After this we can hardly wonder that in the
later Sanskrit literature of the Purâ*n*as, Ka appears as a recognised
god, as the supreme god, with a genealogy of his own, perhaps even with
a wife; and that in the Laws of Manu, one of the recognised forms of
marriage, generally known by the name of Pra*g*âpati-marriage, occurs
under the monstrous title of 'Kâya.' Stranger still, grammarians who
know that ka forms the dative kasmai only if it is an interrogative
pronoun, consider kasmai in our hymn as irregular, because, as a proper
name, Ka ought to form the dative Kâya.
