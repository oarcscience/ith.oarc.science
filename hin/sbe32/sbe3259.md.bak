### MA*ND*ALA VII, HYMN 46.

#### ASH*T*AKA V, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 13.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To Rudra</span>.

1\. Offer ye these songs to Rudra whose bow is strong, whose arrows are
swift, the self-dependent [1](sbe3259.htm#an_7:46:1:1.md) god, the
unconquered conqueror, the intelligent, whose weapons are sharp—may he
hear us!

2\. For, being the lord [1](sbe3259.htm#an_7:46:2:1.md), he looks after
what is born on earth; being the universal ruler, he looks after what is
born in heaven. Protecting us, come to our protecting doors, be without
illness among our people, O Rudra!

3\. May that thunderbolt of thine, which, sent from heaven, traverses
the earth, pass us by! A thousand medicines are thine, O thou who art
freely accessible [1](sbe3259.htm#an_7:46:3:1.md); do not hurt us in our
kith and kin!

4\. Do not strike us, O Rudra, do not forsake us! May we not be in thy
way when thou rushest forth furiously. Let us have our altar and a good
report among men [1](sbe3259.htm#an_7:46:4:1.md)—protect us always with
your favours!

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Vasish*th*a. Verse 1 occurs TB. II, 8, 6, 8. Metre, 1-3
*G*agatî; 4 Trish*t*ubh.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_7:46:1:1">1</span>. The TB. has svadhâ´mne for
svadhâ´vne, mî*d*kúshe for vedháse, and *srin*otana for *srin*otu na*h*.
The commentator explains both svadhâmne = svakîyasthânayuktâya, and
svadhâvne = svadhâ*s*abdavâ*k*yenânnena yuktâya vâ. On vedhas, see
Bartholomae, K. Z. XXVII, 361; Ludwig, Z. D. M. G. XL, 716.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_7:46:2:1">1</span>. Geldner translates kshaye*n*a by
'from his high seat.' The meaning of kshaya in this place seems defined
by the parallel expression sâ´mrâ*g*yena.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_7:46:3:1">1</span>. Svapivâta has been variously
translated. Grassmann gives Vielbegehrter; Ludwig, des windhauch in
schlaf versenkt; Roth, wohl verstehend, denkend; Geldner, freundlicher;
Muir, thou who art easy of access, which seems to me the right
rendering; cf. sûpâyana. It is derived from api + vat, which occurs six
times in the Rig-veda. As a simple verb it means 'to go near, to
attend,' as a causative, the same, or 'to bring near.' Thus, VII; 3, 10.
ápi krátum su-*k*étasam vatema, may we obtain wisdom, full of good
thoughts. VII, 60, 6. ápi krátum su-*k*étasam vátanta*h*, (the gods)
obtaining wisdom, full of good thoughts (for their worshippers). X, 20,
1 (X, 25, 1). bhadrám na*h* ápi vâtaya mána*h*, let us obtain a good
mind. I, 128, 2. tám ya*gñ*a-sâ´dham ápi vâtayâmasi, we go near to, or
we bring near Agni, the performer of the sacrifice. I, 165, 13.
mánmâni—api-vâtáyanta*h*, bringing the prayers near, or attending to the
prayers. X, 13, 5. pitré putrâ´sa*h* ápi avîvatan *ri*tám, the sons
brought the sacrifice to the father.

Api-vâta would then mean approach, or in a more

<span id="page_438">p. 438</span>

spiritual sense, attention, regard, and su-apivâta would mean either of
easy approach, opposed to durdharsha, or full of kind attention and
regard. See Muir, S*T*. IV, p. 314. note. Bergaigne, III, 306, does not
help us much, though he points out where the difficulty lies.

The following are the Zend passages in which api-vat occurs, with some
notes sent me by Dr. Stein: Apivatahê, Y. 9, 27, 2. p. sg. med. c. Gen.
'Hom, du verstehst dich auf rechte Preissprüche' d. h. kannst sie
würdigen;' apivatâitê daênayâo mâzdayaçnôis, V. 9, 2, 47, 'vertraut mit
dem Gesetz; daênâ´m zarazca dâṭ apaêca aotât, yt. 9, 26: 'wer das Gesetz
lernt und in dasselbe eindringt;' verezyôtûca frâcâ vatôyôtû, Y. 35, 6,
'das richtig erkannte führe er aus und theile es mit;' Y. 44, 18 scheint
apivaiti 1. p. sg. med. in der Bedeutung: 'in Erfahrung gebracht haben;'
die Stelle ist indess sehr dunkel.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_7:46:4:1">1</span>. Â´ na*h* bha*g*a barhíshi
*g*îva*s*a*m*sé seems a very simple sentence. It has been translated
without any misgivings by Grassmann, Ludwig, Geldner and Kaegi and
others.

Grassmann translates: 'Lass lange lebend uns die Streu noch schmücken.'

Ludwig: 'Gib uns anteil an dem barhis als verheiszung des lebens.'

Kaegi and Geldner (or Roth): 'Verstatt uns Theil an Opfer und an
Herrschaft.'

Bergaigne often points to such translations with scorn, but after he has
written several pages on the words in question, here on *g*îva*s*a*m*sa,
he is indeed very positive that it means 'formule qui donne la vie' (I,
p. 306), but what such a 'formule' is, and how this meaning fits the
whole sentence, he does not tell us.

Let us begin with what is clear. Â´ bha*g*a na*h* with locative, means
'appoint us to something,' i. e. 'give us something.' Thus I, 121, 15.
â´ na*h* bha*g*a góshu, means 'divide us, distribute us, appoint us to
cows,' i. e. 'give us cows as our share.' The same expression is used
when

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

instead of cows or riches, the gods are asked to give long life, glory,
or sinlessness. Thus we read, I, 104, 6. sá*h* tvám na*h* indra sû´rye
sá*h* apsú anâgâstvé â´ bha*g*a *g*îva*s*a*m*sé, that is,' Indra, allow
us to share and rejoice in the sun, in water, in sinlessness and praise
of men.' X, 45, 10. â´ tám bha*g*a sau*s*ravaséshu, 'give him, let him
share in, good renown.'

When we are once familiar with this phraseology, we cannot doubt that in
our passage also we have to translate, let us have our barhis, our
homely altar, and good report among men.'

Another word narâ*s*a*m*sa had originally the same meaning as
*g*îva*s*a*m*sa, but it was chiefly used as a name of Agni. He was
called Narâ*s*a*m*sa, i. e. Männerlob, or dyó*h* *s*á*m*sa, Himmelslob,
as a German poet was once called Frauenlob, not only because he praised
women, but because he was praised by women. As we can say, God is my
song, the Vedic *Ri*shis might call any god the *s*a*m*sa, i. e. the
praise or song of men, of the fathers, or of the gods. So far from
agreeing with Bergaigne, 'on comprendrait moins bien qu’une locution
dont le sens propre aurait été "éloge mortel" e.ût désigné celui qui est
loué par le mortel,' nothing is easier and better confirmed by other
languages, while the invocation of 'une formule sacrée' is almost
unintelligible. If in a later hymn Indra is called *g*yésh*th*a*h*
mántra*h*, in X, 50, 4, I should translate, 'thou art the oldest or the
best song,' that is, 'the theme of the oldest song,' but not thou art a
magic formula. There is no necessity therefore for taking narâ*s*a*m*sa
as a possessive compound, possessed of the praise of men, nor must we
forget that in words which become almost proper names the accent is by
no means always a safe guide.
