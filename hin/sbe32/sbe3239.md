### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 57.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 21-22.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. O Rudras, joined by Indra, friends on golden chariots, come hither
for our welfare! This prayer from us is acceptable to you like the
springs of heaven to a thirsty soul longing for water.

2\. O you sons of P*ris*ni, you are armed with daggers and spears, you
are wise, carrying good bows and arrows and quivers, possessed of good
horses and chariots. With your good weapons, O Maruts, you go to
triumph!

3\. You shake [1](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:3:1.md) the sky and the mountains
(clouds) for wealth to the liberal giver; the forests bend down out of
your way from fear [2](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:3:2.md). O sons of P*ris*ni, you
rouse the earth when you, O terrible ones, have harnessed the spotted
deer for triumph!

4\. The Maruts, blazing with the wind, clothed in rain, are as like one
another as twins, and well adorned. They have tawny horses, and red
horses, they are faultless, endowed with exceeding vigour; they are in
greatness wide as the heaven.

5\. Rich in rain-drops, well adorned, bounteous, terrible to behold, of
inexhaustible wealth, noble by birth, golden-breasted, these singers of
the sky [1](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:5:1.md) have obtained their immortal name
[2](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:5:2.md).

6\. Spears are on your two shoulders, in your arms are placed strength,
power, and might. Manly thoughts dwell in your heads, on your chariots
are weapons, and every beauty has been laid on your bodies.

7\. O Maruts, you have given us wealth of cows, horses, chariots, and
heroes, golden wealth! O men of Rudra, bestow on us great praise, and
may I enjoy your divine protection!

8\. Hark, O heroes, O Maruts! Be gracious to us! You who are of great
bounty, immortal, righteous, truly listening to us, poets, young,
dwelling on mighty mountains [1](sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:8:1.md), and grown
mighty.

#### NOTES.

The same poet and deity. Metre, 1-6 Gagatî; 7, 8 Trish*t*ubh. None of
its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS.; verse 6 in MS. IV, II, 4.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:57:3:1">1</span>. Dhû is construed with two
accusatives, see RV. III, 45, 4; otherwise vâsu might be connected with
dâ*s*úshe. The third pâda is 3 literally repeated soon after, V, 60, 2;
see note 1 to I, 37, 7.

Note <span id="an_5:57:3:2">2</span>. Yâ´mana*h* bhiyâ´ may be from fear
of your approach.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:57:5:1">1</span>. In divá*h* arkâ´*h* even Bergaigne
allows that arká may mean singer, not song.

Note <span id="an_5:57:5:2">2</span>. Nâ´ma, name, is here as elsewhere
what is meant by the name, therefore immortal being or immortality.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_5:57:8:1">1</span>. B*rí*hadgiraya*h* cannot well mean
with a powerful voice. The Maruts are called girish*th*a, VIII, 94, 12,
dwelling on mountains, and like b*ri*haddiva, b*ri*hadgiri seems to have
been intended for dwelling on high mountains.
