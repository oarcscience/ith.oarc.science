### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 2.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 3-4.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To Vâyu</span>.

1\. Come hither, O Vâyu, thou beautiful one [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:1:1.md)!
These Somas are ready, drink of them, hear our call!

2\. O Vâyu, the praisers celebrate thee with hymns, they who know the
feast-days [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:2:1.md), and have prepared the Soma.

3\. O Vâyu, thy satisfying stream [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:3:1.md) goes to
the worshipper, wide-reaching, to the Soma-draught.

4\. O Indra and Vâyu, these (libations of Soma) are poured out; come
hither for the sake of [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:4:1.md) our offerings, for
the drops (of Soma) long for you.

5\. O Indra and Vâyu, you perceive the libations, you who are rich in
booty [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:5:1.md); come then quickly hither!

6\. O Vâyu and Indra, come near to the work [1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:6:1.md)
of the sacrificer, quick, thus is my prayer [2](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:6:2.md),
O ye men!

7\. I call Mitra, endowed with holy strength
[1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:7:1.md), and Varu*n*a, who destroys all enemies; who
both fulfil a prayer accompanied by fat offerings
[2](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:7:2.md).

8\. On the right way, O Mitra and Varu*n*a, you have obtained great
wisdom, you who increase the right and adhere to the right
[1](sbe3260.htm#an_1:2:8:1.md);

9\. These two sages, Mitra and Varu*n*a, the mighty, wide-ruling, give
us efficient strength.

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Madhu*kkh*andas Vai*s*vâmitra, and addressed to Vâyu (1-3),
Indra and Vâyu (4-6), and to Mitra and Varu*n*a (7-9). Metre, Gâyatrî.
Verse 4 = VS. VII, 8; XXXIII, 56; TS. I, 4, 4, 1; MS. I. 3, 6. Verse 7 =
SV. II, 197; VS. XXXIII, 57: Verse 8 = SV. II, 198. Verse 9 = SV. II,
199.

This hymn, with the hymn I, 3, belongs to the Pra-uga ceremony. It
consists of three t*rik*as.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:2:1:1">1</span>. Dar*s*ata, as applied to the wind,
may be intended for visible, but its more general meaning is
conspicuous, clarus, insignis.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:2:2:1">1</span>. Aharvid, which Benfey translates by
tagekundig, Grassmann, die des Tages (Anbruch) kundig, seems to have two
meanings. When applied to men, poets or priests, it means those who know
(vid) the right days or seasons for every sacrifice, but when it is
applied to certain deities, particularly those of the morning, it means
finding (vind), bringing back the day, like lucifer. Thus the A*s*vins
are called aharvidâ (VIII, 5, 9; 21). The power (daksha) of Vish*n*u is
called aharvid, conquering, or bringing, the light of the day (I, 156,
4). The priests, as inviting these gods, might possibly themselves be
called aharvid, bringing back the light of day, but this seems doubtful.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:2:3:1">1</span>. This verse, though it seems easy,
is really full of difficulties. The meaning of dhenâ is very doubtful.
It is explained as lips by native authorities, and would in that case be
derived from dhe, to suck. But though this meaning is possible in some
passages, particularly where dhene occurs in the dual, in other passages
dhenâ seems clearly to

<span id="page_442">p. 442</span>

mean a stream of milk, or of some other liquid, poured out
(vis*ri*sh*t*a) from the clouds or at a sacrifice. It often occurs in
the dual dhene, and has then been taken as the upper and lower lips (not
the nares, as Roth suggests), distinguished from *s*ipre, the upper and
lower jaws. See note on II, 34, 3. Sâya*n*a (Rv. Bh. I, 101, 10)
explains it by *g*ihvopa*g*ihvike. Durga adds (Nirukta Bhâshya, VI, 17)
âdhastye da*m*sh*t*re vâ *g*ihvopa*g*ihvike vâ, ity eke, tayor hy
anna*m* dhîyate.

Benfey translates: 'Vâyu, deine vorkostende Lippe schreitet zum Opferer,
weit hingestreckt zum Somatrank.' Prap*riñk*atî can hardly mean
vorkostend.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:2:4:1">1</span>. The instrumental práyobhi*h* is
best translated here by 'for the sake of;' see Wenzel, Instrumental, p.
104.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:2:5:1">1</span>. On vâ*g*inî and vâ*g*a, see 'India,
what can it teach us?' pp. 164, 166. The transition of meaning from
vâ*g*a, booty, to vâ*g*a, wealth in general, finds an analogy in the
German kriegen, to obtain, also in Gewinn, and A. S. winnan, to strive,
to fight, to obtain. Vâ*g*inîvasû, in the dual, is a frequent epithet of
the A*s*vins, II, 37, 5; V, 74, 6; 7; 75, 3; 78, 3; VIII, 5, 3; 12; 20;
8, 10; 9, 4; 10, 5; 22, 7; 14; 18; 26, 3; 85, 3; 101, 8; of Indra, III,
42, 5; X, 96, 8.

It differs little from vâ*g*inîvat, which is likewise applied to the
A*s*vins, I, 120, 10, and comes to mean simply wealthy, liberal; cf. I,
122, 8; VII, 69, 1. Vâ*g*inîvati is an epithet of Ushas, Sarasvatî, and
Sindhu. A common phrase is vâ´*g*ebhi*h* vâ*g*ínîvatî, lit. wealthy in
wealth, cf. I, 3, 10. Vâ*g*inî occurs as the feminine of vâ*g*in,
wealthy, or strong, but never in the sense of mare; cf. III, 61, 1.
úsha*h* vâ´*g*ena vâ*g*ini, Ushas wealthy by wealth or booty; VI, 61, 6.
Sarasvati vâ´geshu vâ*g*ini, Sarasvati, strong in battles; cf. I, 4, 8;
9. Native commentators generally explain vâ*g*ini by sacrifice,
vâ*g*inîvasu, by dwelling in the sacrifice. I take vâ*g*ini in compounds
like vâ*g*inîvasu as a collective

<span id="page_443">p. 443</span>

substantive, like padminî, ûhinî, vâhinî, tretinî, anîkinî, &c., and in
the sense of wealth; unless we may look upon vâ*g*inîvat as formed in
analogy to such words as tavishî-mat, only that in this case tavishî
exists in the sense of strength. Pischel's explanation, Ved. Stud. p. 9,
rich in mares, takes for granted the existence of vâ*g*ini in the sense
of mare. I have not found any passage where vâ*g*inî has necessarily
that sense.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:2:6:1">1</span>. Nishk*ri*ta can hardly mean here
what it means in later Sanskrit, a rendezvous.

Note <span id="an_1:2:6:2">2</span>. On ítthâ´ dhiyâ´, see Pischel, Ved.
Stud. p. 184.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:2:7:1">1</span>. Pûtádaksha, cf. pûtákratu, VIII,
68, 17.

Note <span id="an_1:2:7:2">2</span>. Gh*ri*tâ*k*î seems to be taken here
in a technical sense, like gh*ri*tavat, i. e. with oblations of butter
thrown into the fire. In I, 167, 3, I took gh*ri*tâ*k*î in the more
general sense of bright, resplendent, while others ascribed to it the
meaning of bringing fatness, i. e. rain. It may also mean accompanied by
ghee. See B.-R. s. v.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:2:8:1">1</span>. *Ri*tasp*rís*, probably not very
different from *ri*tasâ´p.
