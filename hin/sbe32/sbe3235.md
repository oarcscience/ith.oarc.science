### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 53.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 11-13.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. Who knows their birth? or who was of yore in the favour of the
Maruts, when they harnessed the spotted deer
[1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:1:1)?

2\. Who has heard them when they had mounted their chariots, how they
went forth? For the sake of what liberal giver (Sudâs) did they run, and
their comrades followed [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:2:1), (as) streams of
rain (filled) with food?

3\. They themselves said to me when day by day
[1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:3:1) they came to the feast with their birds
[2](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:3:2): they (the Maruts) are manly youths and
blameless; seeing them, praise them thus;

4\. They who shine by themselves in their ornaments
[1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:4:1), their daggers, their garlands, their
golden chains, their rings, going [2](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:4:2) on their
chariots and on dry land.

5\. O Maruts, givers of quickening rain, I am made to rejoice, following
after your chariots, as after days [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:5:1) going
with rain.

6\. The bucket which the bounteous heroes shook down from heaven for
their worshipper, that cloud they send [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:6:1)
along heaven and earth, and showers follow on the dry land.

7\. The rivers having pierced [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:7:1) the air with
a rush of water, went forth like milk-cows; when your spotted deer roll
about [2](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:7:2) like horses that have hasted to the
resting-place on their road.

8\. Come hither, O Maruts, from heaven, from the sky, even from near
[1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:8:1); do not go far away!

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

9\. Let not the Rasâ, the Anitabhâ, the Kubhâ, the Krumu, let not the
Sindhu delay you! Let not the marshy Sarayu prevent you! May your favour
be with us alone!

10\. The showers come forth after the host of your chariots, after the
terrible Marut-host of the ever-youthful heroes
[1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:10:1).

11\. Let us then follow with our praises and our prayers each host of
yours, each troop, each company [1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:11:1).

12\. To what well-born generous worshipper have the Maruts gone to-day
on that march,

13\. On which you bring to kith and kin the never-failing seed of corn?
Give us that for which we ask you, wealth and everlasting happiness!

14\. Let us safely pass through our revilers, leaving behind the
unspeakable and the enemies. Let us be with you when in the morning
[1](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:14:1) you shower down health, wealth
[2](sbe3235.htm#an_5:53:14:2), water, and medicine, O Maruts!

15\. That mortal, O men, O Maruts, whom you protect, may well be always
beloved by the gods, and rich in valiant offspring. May we be such!

16\. Praise the liberal Maruts, and may they delight on the path of this
man here who praises them, like cows in fodder. When they go, call after
them as for old friends, praise them who love you, with your song!

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to *S*yâvâ*s*va Âtreya. Metre, 1, 5, 10, 11, 15 Kakubh; 2
B*ri*hatî; 3 Anush*t*ubh; 4 Pura-ush*n*ih; 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16
Satob*ri*hatî; 8, 12 Gâyatrî. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS.,
AV.; the sixth verse is found in TS. II, 4, 8, 1; MS. II, 4, 7;
Kâ*th*aka XI, 9.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:53:1:1">1</span>. Kilâsî, as fem. of kilâsa, does
not occur again. It seems to have meant spotted or marked with pocks,
and would be intended for the p*rí*shatîs. Does Kailâsa come from the
same source?

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:53:2:1">1</span>. Kásmai sasru*h* is much the same
as kásmai adyá sú*g*âtâya … prá yayu*h*, in verse 12. We must then begin
a new sentence, ánu âpáya*h*, their comrades after, namely sasru*h*.
Thus we read in verse 10 tám ya*h* *s*árdham … ánu prá yanti
v*ri*sh*t*áya*h*, where the streams of rain are represented as the
followers of the Maruts. We might also translate in our sentence: For
what liberal giver did their comrades, the streams of rain with food
follow after (the Maruts).

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:53:3:1">1</span>. Úpa dyúbhi*h* occurs again VIII,
40, 8, and seems to mean from day to day.

Note <span id="an_5:53:3:2">2</span>. The birds of the Maruts, probably
of the same character as the birds of the A*s*vins.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:53:4:1">1</span>. I translate a*ñg*i by ornament in
general, not by paint or ointment,. though that may have been its
original meaning.

Note <span id="an_5:53:4:2">2</span>. On *s*râya, see Pâ*n*. III, 3, 24.
Dhánvasu may possibly have been intended as governed by svábhânava*h*,
and not by *s*râyâ´*h*; see, however, VIII, 33, 6. *s*má*s*rushu
*s*ritá*h*.

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:53:5:1">1</span>. On dyâ´va*h*, nom. plur., and
ráthân, acc. plur., compare Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier, p. 88. The text
is doubtful, and may be a corruption of v*ri*sh*t*î´*h* dyâ´va*h*
yatî´*h* iva.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_5:53:6:1">1</span>. The Taittirîyas, TS. II, 4, 8, 1,
read par*g*ányâ*h*; the Maitreyas, prá par*g*ánya*h* s*rig*atâm and
yantu.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_5:53:7:1">1</span>. Tat*ri*dâná, as t*ri*d occurs in
the Veda in the Parasmaipada only, may be intended for a passive, bored,
dug out, tapped. One would, however, expect in that case an
instrumental, marudbhi*h*, by whom they were brought forth.

Note <span id="an_5:53:7:2">2</span>. The words ví yád vártanta enyã*h*
have received various explanations. Wilson translates: 'When the rivers
rush in various directions.' Sâya*n*a admits also another meaning: 'When
the rivers grow.' Ludwig translates: 'Sich verteilend gehn die
schimmernden auszeinander.' Grassmann, very boldly: 'Wie Hengste
träufelnd, wenn vom Wege heimgekehrt, sie zu den bunten Stuten gehn.'
Vi-v*ri*t seems, however, to have a very special meaning, namely,
rolling on the ground, and this the spotted deer are here said to have
done, like horses at the end of their journey. We read of the
sacrificial horse, *S*at. Br. XIII, 5, 1, 16. sa yady ava vâ *g*ighred
vi vâ varteta, sam*ri*ddho me ya*gñ*a iti ha vidyât; cf. XI, 2, 5, 3. In
the TS. VII, I, 19, 3, the commentator explains vivartanam by nirgatya
bhûmau vilu*nth*anam, the rolling on the ground. The same meaning is
applicable to Mahâparinibbâna Sutta, p. 66 (Childers), where the
Bhikkhus are said to roll on the ground when they hear of Buddha's
death; also to Mahâbh. III, 11953 (of a wild boar). The meaning
therefore in our passage seems to be, when the deer roll on the ground,
as horses are wont to do at the end of a journey.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_5:53:8:1">1</span>. Amâ´t corresponds here to
p*ri*thivi in other places. Originally it may have meant from the home.

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

##### Verse 9.

This verse has often been discussed on account of the names of the
rivers which it contains. *S*yâvâ*s*va had mentioned the Yamunâ in 52,
17, and some interpreters have been inclined to give to parush*n*î in
52, 9 a geographical meaning, taking it for the river Ravi, instead of
translating it by cloud. The geographical names are certainly
interesting, but they have been discussed so often that I need not dwell
on them here. (See M. M., India. p. 163.)

The Rasâ, known to the Zoroastrians as the Ra*n*hâ, was originally the
name of a real river, but when the Âryas moved away from it into the
Punjâb, it assumed a mythical character, and became a kind of Okeanos,
surrounding the extreme limits of the world.

Anitabhâ seems to be the name of a new river or part of a river. It can
hardly be taken as an epithet of Rasâ, as Ludwig suggests. Anitabhâ,
whose splendour has not departed (Ludwig), or, amitabhâ, of endless
splendour, would hardly be Vedic formations. (Chips, I, p. 157; Hibbert
Lect., p. 207; India, pp. 166, 173, notes.)

Kubhâ is the Κωφήν or Κωφής of the Greeks, the Kabul river. The Krumu I
take to be the Kurrum. (India, p. 177, note.)

The Sindhu is the Indus, though it is difficult to say which part of it,
while the Sarayu has been supposed to be the Sarayû, the affluent of the
Gaṅgâ, but may also be a more general name for some more northern river
in the Punjâb. (See Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, pp. 17 f., 45; Muir,
S. T. II, p. xxv, note.)

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_5:53:10:1">1</span>. Návyasînâm has been a puzzle to
all interpreters. Sâya*n*a seems to me to give the right interpretation,
namely, nûtanânâm. As from a*ñg*asâ, instr. sing., straightway,
a*ñg*asî´na was formed, straightforward; from návyasâ, instr. sing.,
anew, návyasîna seems to have been formed in the sense of new.
Návyasînâm might then be a somewhat

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

irregular gen. plur., referring to ga*n*ám mâ´rutam, the Marut-host of
the young men; see V, 58, 1. Lanman (p. 515) takes it for a gen. plur.
fem., but in that case it could not refer to ráthânâm. Zimmer translates
endlos, Bergaigne (II, 400) thinks of new or rejuvenescent mothers.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_5:53:11:1">1</span>. See III, 26, 6.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_5:53:14:1">1</span>. Usrí, in the morning. Lanman (p.
427) proposes to read ushári, but the metre would be better preserved by
reading v*ri*sh*t*vî´ as trisyllabic. The difficulty is the construction
of the gerund v*ri*sh*t*vî´, which refers to the Maruts, and syâ´ma
sahá, which refers to the sacrificers.

Note <span id="an_5:53:14:2">2</span>. On sám yó*h*, see I, 165, 4, note
2.

The metrical structure of this hymn is interesting. If we represent the
foot of eight syllables by a, that of twelve by b, we find the following
succession:

<div align="center">

|     |     |         |         |       |         |         |     |         |
|-----|-----|---------|---------|-------|---------|---------|-----|---------|
| I   | 1   | a b a   | II      | 3     | a a a a |         |     |         |
|     | 2   |         | a a b a | 4     | b a a   |         |     |         |
| III | 5   | a a a   | IV      | 8     | a a a   |         |     |         |
|     | 6   |         | b a b a | 9     | b a b a |         |     |         |
|     | 7   | b a b a | VI      | 12    | a a a   |         |     |         |
| V   |     | 10      | a b a   | 13    | b a b a | VII     | 15  | a b a   |
|     |     | 11      |         | a b a | 14      | b a b a | 16  | b a b a |

</div>

We find that I contains the question, II the answer, III description of
rain, IV prayer and invitation, V praise of the companions, VI prayer,
VII conclusion. Comp. Oldenberg's Prolegomena, p. 106 seq.
