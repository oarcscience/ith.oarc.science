### MA*ND*ALA VIII, HYMN 20.

#### ASH*T*AKA VI, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 36-40.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. Come hither, do not fail, when you march forward! Do not stay away,
O united friends, you who can bend even what is firm.

2\. O Maruts, *Ri*bhukshans, come hither on your flaming strong fellies
[1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:2:1.md), O Rudras, come to us to-day with food, you
much-desired ones, come to the sacrifice, you friends of the Sobharis
[2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:2:2.md).

3\. For we know indeed the terrible strength of the sons of Rudra, of
the vigorous Maruts, the liberal givers [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:3:1.md) of
Soma [2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:3:2) (rain.md).

4\. The islands (clouds) were scattered, but the monster remained
[1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:4:1.md), heaven and earth were joined together. O
you who are armed with bright rings, the tracts (of the sky)
[2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:4:2.md) expanded, whenever you stir, radiant with
your own splendour.

5\. Even things that cannot be thrown down resound at your race, the
mountains, the lord of the forest,—the earth quivers on your marches.

6\. The upper sky makes wide room, to let your violence pass, O Maruts,
when these strong-armed heroes display their energies in their own
bodies.

7\. According to their wont these men, exceeding terrible, impetuous,
with strong and unbending forms [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:7:1.md), bring with
them beautiful light [2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:7:2.md).

8\. The arrow of the Sobharis is shot from the bowstrings at the golden
chest on the chariot of the Maruts [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:8:1.md). They,
the kindred of the cow (P*ris*ni),

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

the well-born, should enjoy their food, the great ones should help us.

9\. Bring forward, O strongly-anointed [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:9:1.md)
(priests), your libations to the strong host of the Maruts, the strongly
advancing.

10\. O Maruts, O heroes, come quickly hither, like winged hawks, on your
chariot with strong horses, of strong shape, with strong naves, to enjoy
our libations.

11\. Their anointing is the same, the golden chains shine on their arms,
their spears sparkle.

12\. These strong, manly, strong-armed Maruts, do not strive among
themselves; firm are the bows, the weapons on your chariot, and on your
faces are splendours.

13\. They whose terrible name [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:13:1.md),
wide-spreading like the ocean, is the one of all that is of use, whose
strength is like the vigour of their father,

14\. Worship these Maruts, and praise them! Of these shouters, as of
moving spokes [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:14:1.md), no one is the last; this is
theirs by gift, by greatness [2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:14:2.md) is it theirs.

15\. Happy is he who was under your protection, O Maruts, in former
mornings, or who may be so even now.

16\. Or he, O men, whose libations you went to enjoy; that mighty one, O
shakers, will obtain your favours with brilliant riches and booty.

17\. As the sons of Rudra, the servants of the divine Dyu
[1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:17:1.md), win it, O youths, so shall it be.

18\. Whatever liberal givers may worship [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:18:1.md)
the Maruts, and move about together as generous
[2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:18:2.md) benefactors, even from them turn
[3](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:18:3.md) towards us with a kinder heart, you youths

19\. O Sobhari, call loud with your newest song

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

the young, strong, and pure Maruts, as the plougher calls the cows.

20\. Worship the Maruts with a song, they who are strong like a boxer,
called in to assist those who call [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:20:1.md) for him
in all fights; (worship them) the most glorious, like bright-shining
bulls.

21\. Yes, O united friends, kindred, O Maruts, by a common birth, the
oxen lick one another's humps [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:21:1.md).

22\. O ye dancers, with golden ornaments on your chests, even a mortal
comes (to ask) for your brotherhood [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:22:1.md); take
care of us, ye Maruts, for your friendship lasts for ever.

23\. O bounteous Maruts, bring us some of your Marut-medicine, you
friends, and (quick, like) steeds.

24\. With the favours whereby you favour the Sindhu, whereby you save,
whereby you help Krivi [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:24:1.md), with those
propitious favours be our delight, O delightful ones, ye who never hate
your followers [2](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:24:2.md).

25\. O Maruts, for whom we have prepared good altars, whatever medicine
[1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:25:1.md) there is on the Sindhu, on the Asiknî, in
the seas, on the mountains,

26\. Seeing it, you carry it all on your bodies. Bless us with it! Down
to the earth, O Maruts [1](sbe3251.htm#an_8:20:26:1.md), what hurts our
sick one,—straighten what is crooked!

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Sobhari Kâ*n*va; metre, Kâkubha pragâtha. Verse 1 = SV. I,
401; verse 21 = SV. I, 404.

##### Verse 1.

SV. reads sthâta, and d*ridh*â *k*id yamayish*n*ava*h*.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_8:20:2:1">1</span>. It might be better to supply
rathai*h*, but the poet may have used pars pro toto.

Note <span id="an_8:20:2:2">2</span>. The Sobharis, who are mentioned in
the 8th Ma*nd*ala only, are clearly a clan of that name, and their hymns
form a small collection by itself. See Oldenberg. Prolegomena, p. 209
seq.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_8:20:3:1">1</span>. Mî*lh*vas is sometimes used by
itself in the sense of patron or benefactor, VII, 86, 7; 97, 2. Whether
it can govern a genitive is doubtful, but see VII, 58, 5, note.

Note <span id="an_8:20:3:2">2</span>. Here again, as in II, 34, 11,
Vish*n*u esha seems to mean Soma, possibly the food, or even the seed
(retas) of Vish*n*u. Sâya*n*a too takes Vish*n*u as a name of rain. In
I, 154, 5, we read that the spring of madhu is in the highest place of
Vish*n*u. Could it mean the generous sons of Vish*n*u?

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_8:20:4:1">1</span>. My translation is purely
conjectural. I take dvîpa for isolated or scattered clouds, different
from the du*kkh*unâ, which I take for the black mass of storm-clouds,
threatening destruction. Grassmann: 'Die Wolkeninseln stoben and das
Unheil floh.' Ludwig: 'Empor stigen gewaltig die waszerinseln, still
stand das unglück.'

Note <span id="an_8:20:4:2">2</span>. The coming together of heaven and
earth and their apparent widening have been ascribed to the Maruts
before. It seems hardly possible to translate dhanvâni here by bows. I
take it for the wide expanse, as if the desert, of the sky.

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_8:20:7:1">1</span>. On psu in v*ri*shapsu, see note to
VIII, 7, 7.

Note <span id="an_8:20:7:2">2</span>. Possibly *s*ríyam váhante has to
be taken like *s*ubham yâ, see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 163.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_8:20:8:1">1</span>. In support of the translation
which I proposed in I, 85, 10, note 2, all I can say is that a*g* is a
verb used for shooting forth an arrow, see I, 112, 16, and that vâna may
be used in the sense of bâ*n*a, reed and arrow, and that go is used for
bowstring, see B.-R. s. v. The question, however, arises, how does this
verse come in here? How does the fact that the Sobharis, who are
praising the storm-gods, shoot their arrow at the golden chest on their
chariot, agree with what precedes and follows?

Let us look first whether a more natural translation can be found. B.-R.
translate: 'The sacrificial music of the Sobharis is furnished and
therefore made more attractive by draughts of milk (or animal food).' In
order to support such a translation, it should be proved, first, that
vâ*n*a ever means sacrificial music, and that such sacrificial music can
be spoken of as a*g*yate (it is furnished), gobhi*h* (by milk-draughts).
Grassmann translates: 'Durch Milchtrank wird der Sobharis Musik
belohnt.' Here again it must be proved that vâ*n*a can mean sacrificial
music, and a*g*yate, it is rewarded. Ludwig translates: 'Mit der milch
wird gesalbt den Sobhari der zapfen am wagen am goldnen korbe.' This is
explained to mean that 'the bolt on the chariot of the Maruts is to be
greased with milk, so that the milk may stream down on the Sobharis.' I
doubt whether vâ*n*a can mean bolt, and I do not see that the intention
of the poet, namely to ask for rain, would be conveyed by such words.

Sâya*n*a interprets: 'Through the cows, i. e. the hymns, of the Sobharis
the lyre of the Maruts is made evident;' or; 'by the cows, i. e. the
Maruts, the lyre is manifested for the sake of the Sobharis.'

In support of my own translation I can only appeal to a

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

custom ascribed by Herodotus (IV, 94) to another ancient Aryan tribe,
namely the Thracians, who, when there is thunder and lightning, shoot
arrows against the sky. Herodotus in trying to find a motive for this
says they do it to threaten the god. because they believe in no other
god, but their own. This may be so; the only question is whether in
shooting their arrows against the sky, they hoped to drive the clouds
away, or wished them to give up their treasure, namely the rain. I
should feel inclined to take the latter view, but in either case we see
that what the Thracians did, was exactly what the Sobharis are said to
do here, namely to shoot an arrow at the golden chest or treasure on the
chariot of the Maruts. This is, of course. no more than a conjecture,
and I shall gladly give it up, if a more appropriate meaning can be
elicited from this line. What is against it is the frequent occurrence
of a*ñg* with gobhi*h* in the sense of covering with milk, see IX, 45,
3: V, 3, 2, &c. As to ráthe kó*s*e hira*n*yáye, see VIII, 22, 9.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_8:20:9:1">1</span>. V*ri*shad-a*ñg*aya*h* for
v*ri*sha*n*-a*ñg*aya*h*, see J. Schmidt, K. Z. XXVI, 358. It cannot mean
'raining down ointments,' as Grassmann supposes, because that would be
varshad-a*ñg*aya*h*, if it existed at all. Besides. the a*ñg*is are
never poured down, nor are they sacrificial viands. The repetition of
the word v*ri*shan is intentional. and has been discussed before.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_8:20:13:1">1</span>. Nâman is, of course, more than
the mere name; but name can be used in much the same sense.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_8:20:14:1">1</span>. The simile of the aras, as in V,
58, 5, seems to require another negative.

Note <span id="an_8:20:14:2">2</span>. See V, 87, 2, on dânâ´ and
mahnâ´.

##### Verse 17.

Note <span id="an_8:20:17:1">1</span>. On divá*h* ásurasya vedhása*h*,
see von Bradke. Dyaus Asura, pp. 44 and 46. It should be remembered,

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

however, that vedhas and medhas interchange. Thus in RV. IX, 102, 4, we
have vedhâ´m, in SV. I, 101, medhâ´m. On medhâs, the Zend mazdâ, see
Darmesteter, Ormazd, p. 29. I take servant in the sense of worshipper,
from vidh.

##### Verse 18.

Note <span id="an_8:20:18:1">1</span>. Arhanti, in the sense of
arhayanti, to worship, seems better than to be worthy of, or to have a
right to.

Note <span id="an_8:20:18:2">2</span>. Mî*lh*úsha*h* can be nominative,
see Lanman, p. 511; but it may also refer to the Maruts, and then be
accusative.

Note <span id="an_8:20:18:3">3</span>. Instead of â´ vav*ri*dhvam, which
Ludwig translates, Nemt uns für euch in besitz, Grassmann translates,
Wendet euch zu uns her. He read therefore â´ vav*ri*ddhvam, and this,
the plural corresponding to â´ vav*ri*tsva, seems to be the right
reading.

##### Verse 20.

Note <span id="an_8:20:20:1">1</span>. Grassmann proposes to change
p*ri*tsú hót*ri*shu into yutsú p*ri*tsúshu. But may not hót*ri*shu be
used here in a sense corresponding to that of hávya? Hávya has almost
the technical meaning of an ally who is to be called for assistance.
Thus IV, 24, 2. sá*h* v*ri*trahátye hávya*h*; VII, 32, 24. bháre-bhare
*k*a hávya*h*, &c. Now a hávya*h*, one who is called, presupposes a
hót*ri*, one who calls for assistance. It is true that hot*ri*, from hu,
to pour out, has so completely become a technical name that it seems
strange to see it used here, in a new etymological sense, as caller. But
the connection with havya may justify what may have been meant as a play
on the words. Wilson seems to have taken the verse in a similar sense,
when he translates: 'and like a boxer who has been challenged over his
challengers.' He, like Ludwig, takes hot*ri* as a challenger. I prefer
to take it as calling for aid. I am not satisfied, however, with either
translation, nor does Grassmann or Ludwig offer anything useful.

##### Verse 21.

Note <span id="an_8:20:21:1">1</span>. In the SV. marúta*h* and riháte
have the accent

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

on the second syllable. Sábandhava*h* was used before of the Maruts, V,
59, 5; according to its accent it would here refer to gâ´va*h*. I can
see no meaning in this verse except a very naturalistic one, namely that
the Maruts, who are described as friends and brothers, as never
quarrelling and always of one mind, are here compared to oxen, grazing
in the same field, and so far from fighting, actually licking the humps
on each other's backs.

##### Verse 22.

Note <span id="an_8:20:22:1">1</span>. Grassmann, 'geht euch an um eure
Brüderschaft;' possibly, 'becomes your brother.'

##### Verse 24.

Note <span id="an_8:20:24:1">1</span>. It is, no doubt, very tempting to
change tû´rvatha into turvá*s*am, as Ludwig proposes. The difficulty is
to understand how such a change should have come about. Sindhu may mean
here, not so much the river, as the people living on its shores. Krivi
is said to be an old name of the Pa*ñk*âlas (*S*at. Br. XIII, 5, 4, 7).
But, because the Pa*ñk*âlas were called Krivis, and because in later
times we often hear of Kuru-Pa*ñk*âlas, it does in no way follow that
the Krivis were identical with the Kurus. It proves rather the contrary.
Kuru may be derived from kar, and may have meant active, but it may also
have had a very different original meaning. A derivation of krivi from
kar is still more objectionable.

Note <span id="an_8:20:24:2">2</span>. Asa*k*advisha*h*, which I
translate by not hating your followers, is translated by Ludwig: 'ihr,
denen kein haszer folgt.' It may also be rendered by hating those who do
not follow you.'

##### Verse 25.

Note <span id="an_8:20:25:1">1</span>. The medicines are generally
brought by Rudra, and by his sons, the Maruts.

##### Verse 26.

Note <span id="an_8:20:26:1">1</span>. As to kshamâ´ rápa*h*, see X, 59,
8-10; AV VI, 57, 3; as to íshkarta, VIII, I, 12.
