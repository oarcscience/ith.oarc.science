### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 171.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 11.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. I come to you with this adoration, with a hymn I implore the favour
[1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:1:1) of the quick (Maruts.md). O Maruts, you have
rejoiced [2](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:1:2.md) in it clearly
[3](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:1:3.md), put down then all anger and unharness
your horses!

2\. This reverent praise of yours, O Maruts, fashioned in the heart, has
been offered by the mind [1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:2:1.md), O gods! Come to
it, pleased in your mind, for you give increase to (our) worship
[2](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:2:2.md).

3\. May the Maruts when they have been praised be gracious to us, and
likewise Maghavat (Indra), the best giver of happiness, when he has been
praised. May our trees (our lances) [1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:3:1.md)
through our valour stand always erect, O Maruts!

4\. I am afraid of this powerful one, and trembling in fear of Indra.
For you the offerings were prepared,—we have now put them away, forgive
us!

5\. Thou through whom the Mânas [1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:5:1.md) see the
mornings, whenever the eternal dawns flash forth with power
[2](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:5:2.md), O Indra, O strong hero, grant thou glory
to us with the Maruts, terrible with the terrible ones, strong and a
giver of victory.

6\. O Indra, protect thou these bravest of men
[1](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:6:1) (the Maruts.md), let thy anger be turned away
[2](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:6:2.md) from the Maruts, for thou hast become
[3](sbe3231.htm#an_1:171:6:3.md) victorious together with those brilliant
heroes. May we have an invigorating autumn, with quickening rain!

##### NOTES.

The Anukrama*n*î assigns verses 1 and 2 to the Maruts, the rest to Indra
Marutvat. The poet is again Agastya. The whole hymn corresponds to the
situation as described in the preceding hymns, and leads on to a kind of
compromise between the Maruts, who seem really the favourite gods of the
poet, and Indra, an irresistible and supreme deity whose claims cannot
be disregarded.

None of the verses of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., TS., AV.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:171:1:1">1</span>. Sumati here means clearly favour,
as in I, 73, 6, 7; while in I, 166, 6 it means equally clearly prayer.

Note <span id="an_1:171:1:2">2</span>. Ludwig takes rarâ*n*átâ as
referring to sûkténa and námasâ. The accent of rarâ*n*átâ is irregular,
and likewise the retaining of the final long â in the Pada text.
Otherwise the form is perfectly regular, namely the 2 p. plural of the
reduplicated aorist, or the so-called aorist of the causative <span
id="fr_124"></span>[a](#fn_115). Pâ*n*ini (VII, 4, 2, 3.md) gives a number
of verbs which form that aorist as  ̆  ̆  ̄, and not as  ̆  ̄  ̆ e. g.
a*s*a*s*âsat, not a*s*î*s*asat; ababâdhat, ayayâ*k*at, &c. Some verbs
may take both forms, e. g. abibhra*g*at and ababhrâ*g*at. This option
applies to all Kâ*n*yâdi verbs, and one of these is ra*n*, which
therefore at the time of Kâtyâyana was supposed to have formed its
reduplicated aorist both as árarâ*n*at and as árîra*n*at. Without the
augment we expect rî´ra*n*ata or rárâ*n*ata. The question is why the
final a should have been lengthened not only in the Sa*m*hitâ, that
would be explicable, but in the Pada text also. The conjunctive of the
perfect would be rârá*n*ata. See also Delbrück, Verbum, p. 111.

Note <span id="an_1:171:1:3">3</span>. Vedyâbhis, which Ludwig
translates here by um dessentwillen, was ihr erfaren sollt, I have
translated by clearly, though tentatively only.

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:171:2:1">1</span>. The same idea is expressed in X,
47, 7. h*ri*disprí*s*a*h* mánasâ va*k*yámânâ*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:171:2:2">2</span>. Námasa*h* v*ri*dhâ´sa*h* is
intended to convey the idea that the Maruts increase or bless those who
worship them.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:171:3:1">1</span>. The second line has given rise to
various interpretations.

<span class="smallcaps">Grassmann</span>:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Uns mögen aufrecht stehn wie schöne Bäume  
Nach unsrem Wunsch, O Maruts, alle Tage.

</div>

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Hoch mögen sein unsere kämpfenden
lanzen, alle tage, O Marut, sigesstreben.

As komyâ never occurs again, it must for the present be left
unexplained.

There was another difficult passage, I, 88, 3. medhâ´ vánâ ná
k*rin*avante ûrdhvâ, which I translated, 'May the Maruts stir up our
minds as they stir up the forests.' I pointed out there that ûrdhva
means not only upright, but straight and strong (I, 172, 3; II, 30, 3),
and I conjectured that the erect trees might have been used as a symbol
of strength and triumph. Vana, however, may have been used poetically
for anything made of wood, just as cow is used for leather or anything
made of leather. In that case vana might be meant for the wooden walls
of houses, or even for lances (like δούρατα from δόρυ = Sk. dâru), and
the adjective would probably have to determine the true meaning. If
connected with komala it might have the same meaning as εὐξεστός.

Prof. Oldenberg suggests that vanâni may be meant for the wooden vessels
containing the Soma.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:171:5:1">1</span>. The Mânas are the people of
Mânya, see I, 165, 15, note 1, and there is no necessity for taking
mâna, with Grassmann, as a general name for poet (Kuhn's Zeitschrift,
vol. xvi, p. 174).

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

Note <span id="an_1:171:5:2">2</span>. It is doubtful to which word
*s*avasâ belongs.

I take it to be used adverbially with vyush*t*ishu.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:171:6:1">1</span>. We might also translate, 'protect
men from the stronger one,' as we read I, 120, 4. pâtám *k*a sáhyasa*h*
yuvám *k*a rábhyasa*h* na*h*; and still more clearly in IV, 55, 1.
sáhîyasa*h* varu*n*a mitra mártât. But I doubt whether n*rî*n by itself
would be used in the sense of our men, while nara*h* is a common name of
the Maruts, whether as divá*h* nára*h*, I, 64, 4, or as nára*h* by
themselves, I, 64, 10; 166, 13, &c.

Note <span id="an_1:171:6:2">2</span>. On the meaning of avayâ in
ávayâtahe*l*â*h*, see Introduction, [p. xx](sbe3202.htm#page_xx.md).

Note <span id="an_1:171:6:3">3</span>. On dadhâna*h*, see VIII, 97, 13,
&c.
