### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 58.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 23.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. I praise [1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:1:1) now the powerful company of
these ever-young Maruts, who drive violently along with quick horses;
aye, the sovereigns are lords of Am*ri*ta (the immortal).

2\. The terrible company, the powerful, adorned with quoits on their
hands, given to roaring, potent, dispensing treasures, they who are
beneficent, infinite in greatness, praise, O poet, these men of great
wealth!

3\. May your water-carriers come here to-day, all the Maruts who stir up
the rain. That fire which has been lighted for you, O Maruts, accept it,
O young singers

4\. O worshipful Maruts, you create for man an active king, fashioned by
Vibhvan [1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:4:1); from you comes the man who can
fight with his fist, and is quick with his arm, from you the man with
good horses and valiant heroes.

5\. Like the spokes of a wheel, no one is last, like the days they are
born on and on, not deficient in might. The very high sons of P*ris*ni
are full of fury, the Marut cling firmly to their own will
[1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:5:1).

6\. When you have come forth with your speckled deer as horses
[1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:6:1) on strong-fellied chariots, O Maruts, the
waters gush, the forests go asunder [2](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:6:2);—let
Dyu [3](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:6:3) (Sky) roar down, the bull of the Dawn.

7\. At their approach, even the earth opened wide,

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

and they placed (sowed) their own [1](sbe3240.htm#an_5:58:7:1) strength
(the rain), as a husband the germ. Indeed they have harnessed the winds
as horses to the yoke, and the men of Rudra have changed their sweat
into rain.

8\. Hark, O heroes, O Maruts! Be gracious to us! You who are of great
bounty, immortal, righteous, truly listening to us, poets, young,
dwelling on mighty mountains, and grown mighty.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

#### NOTES.

The same poet and deity. Metre, Trish*t*ubh. None of the verses occurs
in SV., VS., AV., TS. Verses 3 and 5 are found in TB. II, 5, 5, 3; II,
8, 5, 7; MS. IV, 11, 2; IV, 4, 18.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:58:1:1">1</span>. On stushé, see M. M., Selected
Essays, I, p. 162; Wilhelm, De infinitivi forma et usu, p. 10;
Bartholomae, in Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, p. 219. I take stushé as 1
pers. sing. Aor. Âtm. (not, as Avery, of the Present) in many places
where it has been taken as an infinitive. For instance, II, 31, 5; VI,
49, 1; 51, 3 (with vo*k*e); 62, 1 (with huve); VIII, 5, 4; 7, 32; 74, 1;
84, 1 (here the second pâda must begin with stushé). It may be an
indicative or a subjunctive. As to stushe, without an accent, its
character cannot be doubtful; see I, 122, 8; 159, 1; V, 33, 6; VI, 21,
2; 48, 14; VIII, 21, 9; 23, 2; 23, 7 (g*rin*e). In II, 20, 4, tám u
stushe índram tám g*rin*îshe, g*rin*îshe is an aorist with vikara*n*a,
like punîshé, I praise that Indra, I laud him. In I, 46, 1, stushé may
be the infinitive, but not necessarily. It is an infinitive in I, 122,
7. stushé sâ vâm varu*n*a mitra râtí*h*, your gift, Varu*n*a and Mitra,
is to be praised. Likewise in VIII, 4, 17 (see BR. s. v. simian); 24, 1;
63, 3, though in several of these passages it must remain doubtful
whether stushé should be taken as an absolute infinitive, or as a finite
verb. In VIII, 65, 5, índra g*rin*îshé u stushé, means, 'Indra, I laud
and praise,' as in II, 20, 4.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:58:4:1">1</span>. Vibhva-tash*t*á is generally
explained as made by a master, or by Vibhvan, one of the *Ri*bhus. This
may be so, though it seems a bold expression (see Bergaigne, II,
410-411). But may it not be a mere synonym of sutash*t*a, and intended
for vibhvane tash*t*a? see Selected Essays, I, p. 143.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:58:5:1">1</span>. See Taitt. Br. II, 8, 5, 7. As to
mimikshu*h*, see note to I, 165, 1.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_5:58:6:1">1</span>. On p*rí*shatîbhi*h* á*s*vai*h*,
see II, 34, 4; V, 55, 6. Bergaigne's note (II, p. 378) does not settle
the question whether the horses of the Maruts were speckled, or whether
they had speckled deer for their horses.

Note <span id="an_5:58:6:2">2</span>. On ri*n*até vánâni, see V, 57, 3.

Note <span id="an_5:58:6:3">3</span>. Dyaus, the father of the Maruts,
the oldest and highest god of heaven, the strong bull, or, it may be,
the man of the dawn. See v. Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 63; Bergaigne, I, p.
316.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_5:58:7:1">1</span>. Roth conjectures svâm for svám,
taking it as a locative of sû, genetrix. This is not without
difficulties, nor is it necessary. That we find in the Rig-veda no other
locative in âm after monosyllabic stems in û is perhaps no serious
objection. But the text as it stands can be translated, 'as a husband
the germ, they have placed (sown) their own strength.' *S*ávas is the
same as v*rí*sh*n*yam and v*rí*sh*n*i *s*áva*h* in VIII, 3, 8; 10.
Dhu*h* is used like dhâ in retodhâ.
