### MA*ND*ALA X, HYMN 77.

#### ASH*T*AKA VIII, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 10-11.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. Let me with my voice shower [1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:1:1) wealth
like cloud-showers [2](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:1:2), like sacrifices of a
sage, rich in oblations. I have praised the goodly host of the Maruts
[3](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:1:3), so that they may be worthy of a Brahman
[4](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:1:4) so that they may be glorious.

2\. These boys have prepared their ornaments for beauty, the goodly host
of the Maruts, through many nights; the sons of Dyu struggled, like
harts, they, the Âdityas, grew high, like banners
[1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:2:1).

3\. They who by their own might seem to have risen above heaven and
earth, like the sun above the cloud, they are glorious, like brilliant
heroes, they shine forth like foe-destroying youths.

4\. When you move along on the bottom of the waters, the earth seems to
break and to melt [1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:4:1). This perfect sacrifice
is meet for you, come hither together, as if enjoying our offerings.

5\. You are as drivers [1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:5:1) on the poles with
their reins, and as brilliant with light at daybreak; like hawks, you
are famous destroyers of foes; like wells [2](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:5:2)
springing forth, you scatter moisture.

6\. When you, O Maruts, come from afar, knowing the great treasure of
the hidden place, O Vasus, the treasure which has to be gained, then
keep away also from afar all who hate us.

7\. The man who, firm in his sacrifice, offers gifts to the Maruts to
the end of the ceremony [1](sbe3253.htm#an_10:77:7:1), he

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

gains health and wealth, blessed with offspring; he shall also be in the
keeping of the gods.

8\. They are indeed our guardians, to be worshipped at all sacrifices,
most blissful by their name of Âdityas; may they, swiftly driving on
their chariots, protect our prayer, quick even on their march,
delighting in our sacrifice.

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Syûmara*s*mi Bhârgava. On the metre, see Rig-veda,
translation, Introd. p. civ; Benfey, Quantitätsversch. IV, 2; 38-39;
Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 92. This hymn and the next belong closely
together. They are both so artificial and obscure that a translation of
them can only be tentative. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV.,
TS., TB., MS.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_10:77:1:1">1</span>. I take prushâ for prushâ*n*i.

Note <span id="an_10:77:1:2">2</span>. I do not think that
abhraprúsha*h* can be meant for the Maruts.

Note <span id="an_10:77:1:3">3</span>. The ná in many of the verses
seems to be due to a mere trick, and untranslatable.

Note <span id="an_10:77:1:4">4</span>. Or, 'I have praised the priestly
host, so that they may be worthy of good Marut-hood.'

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_10:77:2:1">1</span>. Akrâ´*h*, banners, Grassmann;
columns, Ludwig. The meaning is utterly unknown.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_10:77:4:1">1</span>. See Aurel Mayr, Beiträge aus dem
Rig-Veda. p. 12. 'The earth melted,' see Ps. xlvi. 6.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_10:77:5:1">1</span>. Prayu*g* seems to mean here a
driver; pra-yu*g* is often used of the Maruts as harnessing or driving
their horses; see I, 85, 5; V, 52, 8.

Note <span id="an_10:77:5:2">2</span>. Prava has been derived from pru,
to float. I should prefer to derive it from pra-van, from which we have
pra-va*n*a, precipice, possibly the Latin adjective pronus, and, very
irregularly, Greek πρηνής. Stems in radical n frequently enter the class
of stems in â and a, and pravan would become pravâ*h* or prava*h*, as
-*g*an becomes -*g*â*h* and -*g*a*h*; cf. Lanman,

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

p\. 478. Others take vana for a mere suffix like vat. Prava, rushing
forward, would have been a good name for a spring. This, of course, is a
mere conjecture. Others derive pravâ-s from vâ, to blow. As a
substantive pravâ as well as upavâ occurs AV. XII, 1, 51. vâ´tasya
pravâ´m upavâ´m ánu vâty arkí*h*. But these words mean the blowing
before and the blowing after, and not blowers. There are the verbs pravâ
and anuvâ in Tâ*nd*ya Br. I, 9, 7; TS. III, 5, 2, 3; IV, 4, 1, 1. They
are there referred to dawn and night. These passages, however, seem too
technical to allow us to fix the original meaning of prava-*h*. Pravâ in
RV. I, 34, 8, remains unexplained.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_10:77:7:1">1</span>. On ud*rik*i, see Ludwig's note.
