*Vedic Hymns, Part I (SBE32)*, by Max Müller, \[1891\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But what confirms me even more in my view that such strict uniformity
must not be looked for in the ancient <span class="margnote">Conjectural
emendations.</span>hymns of the *Ri*shis, is the fact that in many cases
it would he so very easy to replace the irregular by a regular dipodia.
Supposing that the original poets had restricted themselves to the
dijambus, who could have put in the place of that regular dijambus an
irregular dipodia? Certainly not the authors of the Prâti*s*âkhya, for
their ears had clearly discovered the general rhythm of the ancient
metres; nor their predecessors, for they had in many instances preserved
the tradition of syllables lengthened in accordance with the
requirements of the metre. I do not mean to insist too strongly on this
argument, or to represent those who handed down the tradition of the
Veda as endowed with anything like apaurusheyatva. Strange accidents
have happened in the text of the Veda, but they have generally happened
when the sense of the hymns had ceased to be understood; and if anything
helped to preserve the Veda from greater accidents, it was due, I
believe, to the very fact that the metre continued to be understood, and
that oral tradition, however much it might fail in other respects, had
at all events to satisfy the ears of the hearers. I should

<span id="page_ci">p. ci</span>

have been much less surprised if all irregularities in the metre had
been smoothed down by the flux and reflux of oral tradition, a fact
which is so apparent in the text of Homer, where the gaps occasioned by
the loss of the digamma, were made good by the insertion of unmeaning
particles; but I find it difficult to imagine by what class of men, who
must have lived between the original poets and the age of the
Prâti*s*âkhyas, the simple rhythm of the Vedic metres should have been
disregarded, and the sense of rhythm, which ancient people possess in a
far higher degree than we ourselves, been violated through crude and
purposeless alterations. I shall give a few specimens only. What but a
regard for real antiquity could have induced people in VIII, 2, 8, to
preserve the defective foot of a Gâyatrî verse, sămâ̄nē ădhĭ bhâ̄rmān? Any
one acquainted with Sanskrit would naturally read sămâ̄nē ădhĭ
bhâ̄rmă*n*ī. But who would have changed bhârma*n*i, if that had been
there originally, to bhârman? I believe we must scan sămâ̄nē ădhĭ
bh̆â̄rmān, or săm̄ănē ădhĭ bhâ̄rmān, the pæon tertius being a perfectly
legitimate foot at the end of a Gâyatrî verse. In X, 158, 1, we can
understand how an accident happened. The original poet may have said:
S̆û̄ryō nō dĭvās pâ̄tŭ pâ̄tŭ vâ̄tō āntărī̆kshâ̄t, āgnīr nā*h* pâ̄rthĭvēbhy̆ā*h*.
Here one of the two pâtu was lost. But if in the same hymn we find in
the second verse two feet of nine instead of eight syllables each, I
should not venture to alter this except in pronunciation, because no
reason can be imagined why any one should have put these irregular lines
in the place of regular ones.

In V, 41, 10, g*rĭn*î̄tē āgnĭr ētărî̄ nă *s*û̄shāi*h*, *s*ō*k*īshkē*s*ō nĭ
rĭ*n*â̄tĭ vănâ̄, every modern Pandit would naturally read vanâni instead
of vanâ, in order to get the regular Trish*t*ubh metre. But this being
the case, how can we imagine that even the most ignorant member of an
ancient Parishad should wilfully have altered vanâni into vanâ? What
surprises one is, that vanâ should have been spared, in spite of every
temptation to change it into vanâni: for I cannot doubt for one moment
that vanâ is the right reading, only

<span id="page_cii">p. cii</span>

that the ancient poets pronounced it văn̄â̆. Wherever we alter the text of
the Rig-veda by conjecture, we ought to be able, if possible, to give
some explanation how the mistake which we wish to remove came to be
committed. If a passage is obscure, difficult to construe, if it
contains words which occur in no other place, then we can understand
how, during a long process of oral tradition, accidents may have
happened. But when everything is smooth and easy, when the intention of
the poet is not to be mistaken, when the same phrase has occurred many
times before, then to suppose that a simple and perspicuous sentence was
changed into a complicated and obscure string of words, is more
difficult to understand. I know there are passages where we cannot as
yet account for the manner in which an evidently faulty reading found
its way into both the Pada and Sa*m*hitâ texts, but in those very
passages we cannot be too circumspect. If we read VIII, 40, 9, pû̄rvî̄sh
*t*ă īndrōpămâ̄tăyā*h* pû̄rvî̄r ŭtă pră*s*āstăyā*h*, nothing seems more
tempting than to omit indra, and to read pû̄rvî̄sh *t*ă ŭpămâ̄tăyā*h*. Nor
would it be difficult to account for the insertion of indra; for though
one would hardly venture to call it a marginal gloss that crept into the
text—a case which, as far as I can see, has never happened in the hymns
of the Rig-veda—it might be taken for an explanation given by an
Â*k*ârya to his pupils, in order to inform them that the ninth verse,
different from the eighth, was addressed to Indra. But however plausible
this may sound, the question remains whether the traditional reading
could not be maintained, by admitting synizesis of opa, and reading
pû̄rvî̄sh *t*ă īndrō͡pă<span class="small">\*</span>mâ̄tăyā*h*. For a
similar synizesis of  ̄  ̆, see III, 6, 10. prâ̄*k*î̄ ādhvărē͡vă<span
class="small">\*</span> tāsthătū*h*, unless we read prâ̄*k*y ādhvărēvă.

Another and more difficult case of synizesis occurs in

VII, 86, 4. ăvă tvâ̄nēnâ̄ nămăsâ̄ tŭ͡ră<span class="small">\*</span>(*h*)
ĭyâ̄m.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It would be easy
to conjecture tvareyâm instead of tura iyâm, but tvareyâm, in the sense
of 'let me hasten,' is not Vedic. The choriambic ending, however, of a
Trish*t*ubh

<span id="page_ciii">p. ciii</span>

can be proved to be legitimate, and if that is the case, then even the
synizesis of tŭ͡ră<span class="small">\*</span>, though hard, ought not
to be regarded as impossible.

In II, 18, 5,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

â̄ vī*ms*ātyâ̄ trī*ms*ătâ̄ yâ̄hy̆ ārvâ̄ṅ,  
â̄ *k*ātvâ̄rī*ms*ătâ̄ hă͡rĭ<span class="small">\*</span>bhīr yŭ*g*â̄nā*h*,  
â̄ pā*ñk*â̄*s*ătâ̄ sŭrăthēbhĭr īndrā,  
â̄ shāsh*t*y̆â̄ sāptātyâ̄ sōmăpēyām,

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Professor Kuhn
proposes to omit the â at the beginning of the second line, in order to
have eleven instead of twelve syllables. By doing so he loses the
uniformity of the four pâdas, which all begin with â, while by admitting
synizesis of haribhi*h* all necessity for conjectural emendation
disappears.

If the poets of the Veda had objected to a pæon quartus ( ̆  ̆  ̆  ̄) at the
end of a Gâyatrî, what could have been easier than to change IV, 52, 1,
divo adar*s*ĭ dŭhĭtâ̄, into adar*s*i duhĭtâ̄ dĭvā*h*? or X, 118, 6,
ădâ̄bhy̆ā*m* g*rĭ*hăpătīm, into g*rĭ*hăpătĭm ădâ̄bhy̆ām?

If an epitritus secundus ( ̄  ̆  ̄  ̄) had been objectionable in the same
place, why not say VI, 61, 10, stŏmy̆â̄ bhû̄t sărāsvătî̄, instead of
sărāsvătî̄ stŏmy̆â̄ bhû̄t? Why not VIII, 2, 11, rēvāntā*m* hĭ *srĭn*ōmĭ tvâ̄,
instead of rēvāntā*m* hĭ tvâ̄ *srĭn*ōmī?

If an ionicus a minore ( ̆  ̆  ̄  ̄) had been excluded from that place, why
not say I, 30, 10, *g*ărĭt*ri̅*bhyā*h* săkhē văso, instead of săkhē văsō
*g*ărĭt*ri̅*bhyā*h*? or I, 41, 7, vărŭ*n*āsyă măhī psărā*h*, instead of
măhī psărō vărŭ*n*āsyā?

It a dispondeus ( ̄  ̄  ̄  ̄) was to be avoided, then V, 68, 3, măhĭ vâ̄*m*
kshătrām dēvēshū, might easily have been replaced by deveshu vâ*m*
kshătrām măhī , and VIII, 2, 10, *s*ukrâ â*s*irā*m* yâ̄*k*āntē, by
*s*ukrâ yâ*k*antă â̄*s*ĭrām.

If no epitritus primus ( ̆  ̄  ̄  ̄) was allowed, why not say VI, 61, 11,
nĭdās pâ̄tŭ sărāsvătî̄, instead of sărāsvătî̄ nĭdās pâ̄tū, or VIII, 79, 4,
dvēshō yâ̄vî̄r ăghāsyă *k*īt, instead of yâ̄vî̄r ăghāsyă *k*īd dvēshā*h*?

<span id="page_civ">p. civ</span>

Even the epitritus tertius ( ̄  ̄  ̆  ̄) might easily have been avoided by
dropping the augment of apâm in X, 119, 1-13, kuvit somasyâ̄pâ̄m ĭtī. It
is, in fact, a variety of less frequent occurrence than the rest, and
might possibly be eliminated with some chance of success.

Lastly, the choriambus ( ̄  ̆  ̆  ̄) could have been removed in III, 24, 5,
*s*ĭ*s*î̄hĭ nā*h* sû̄nŭmătā*h*, by reading sû̄nŭmătā*h* *s*ĭ*s*î̄hĭ nā*h*,
and in VIII, 2, 31, sănâ̄d ăm*ri̅*ktō dăyătē, by reading ăm*ri̅*ktō dăyătē
sănâ̄t.

But I am afraid the idea that regularity is better than irregularity,
and that in the Veda, where there is a possibility, the regular metre is
to be restored by means of conjectural emendations, has been so ably
advocated by some of the most eminent scholars, that a merely general
argument would now be of no avail. I must therefore give as much
evidence as I can bring together in support of the contrary opinion; and
though the process is a tedious one, the importance of the consequences
with regard to Vedic criticism leaves me no alternative. With regard,
then, to <span class="margnote">Seven Gâyatra V*ri*ttas. </span>the
final dipodia of Gâyatrî verses, I still hold and maintain, that,
although the dijambus is by far the most general metre, the following
seven varieties have to be recognised in the poetry of the Veda <span
id="fr_59"></span>[a](#fn_50):

1\.  ̆  ̄  ̆  ̄ , 2.  ̆  ̆  ̆  ̄, 3.  ̄  ̆  ̄  ̄, 4.  ̆  ̆  ̄  ̄, 5.  ̄  ̄  ̄  ̄, 6.
 ̆  ̄  ̄  ̄, 7.  ̄  ̄  ̆  ̄, 8.  ̄  ̆  ̆  ̄.

I do not pretend to give every passage in which these varieties occur,
out I hope I shall give a sufficient number in support of every one of
them. I have confined myself almost entirely to the final dipodia of
Gâyatrî verses, as the Ânush*t*ubha verses would have swelled the lists
too much.

§ 2.  ̆  ̆  ̆  ̄.

8; VIII, 2, 27; 2, 31; 16, 9; 55, 4; 67, 19; 81, 5; 81, 8; IX, 47, 2.

But although with regard to the Gâyatra, and I may add, the Ânush*t*ubha
pâdas, the evidence as to the variety <span
class="margnote">Traish*t*ubha and *G*âgata Pâdas.</span>of their
v*ri*ttas is such that it can hardly be resisted, a much more determined
stand has been made in defence of the v*ri*tta of the Traish*t*ubha and
*G*âgata pâdas. Here Professor Kuhn and those who follow him maintain
that the rule is absolute, that the former must end in  ̆  ̄  ̆, the latter
in  ̆  ̄  ̆  ̄, and that the eighth syllable, immediately preceding these
syllables, ought, if possible, to be long. Nor can I deny that Professor
Kuhn has brought forward powerful arguments in support of his theory,
and that his emendations of the Vedic text recommend themselves by their
great ingenuity and simplicity. If his theory could be carried out, I
should readily admit that we should gain something. We should have
throughout the Veda a perfectly uniform metre, and wherever we found any
violation of it, we should be justified in resorting to conjectural
criticism.

The only question is at what price this strict uniformity can be
obtained. If, for instance, in order to have the regular v*ri*ttas at
the end of Traish*t*ubha and *G*âgata lines, we were obliged to repeal
all rules of prosody, to allow almost every short vowel to be used as
long, and every long vowel to be used as short, whether long by nature
or by position, we should have gained very little, we

<span id="page_cvii">p. cvii</span>

should have robbed Peter to pay Paul, we should have removed no
difficulty, but only ignored the causes which created it. Now, if we
examine the process by which Professor Kuhn establishes the regularity
of the v*ri*ttas or final syllables of Traish*t*ubha and *G*âgata pâdas,
we find, in addition to the rules laid down before, and in which he is
supported, as we saw, to a great extent by the Prâti*s*âkhya and
Pâ*n*ini, viz. the anceps nature of e and o, and of a long final vowel
before a vowel, the following exceptions or metrical licences, without
which that metrical uniformity at which he aims, could not be obtained:

<span class="margnote">Prosodial Licences.</span>1. The vowel o in the
body of a word is to be treated as optionally short:

II, 39, 3. prătĭ vāstō̆r ūsrâ̄ (see Trish*t*. § 5).

Here the o of vasto*h* is supposed to be short, although it is the
Gu*n*a of u, and therefore very different from the final e of sarve or
âste, or the final o of sarvo for sarvas or mano for manas <span
id="fr_60"></span>[a](#fn_51). It should be remarked that in Greek, too,
the final diphthongs corresponding to the e of sarve and âste are
treated as short, as far as the accent is concerned. Hence ἄποικοι,
τύπτεται, and even γνῶμαι, nom. plur. In Latin, too, the old
terminations of the nom. sing. o and u, instead of the later us, are
short. (Neue, Formenlehre, § 23 seq.)

VI, 51, 15. gō̆pâ̄ ămâ̄.

Here the o of gopâ is treated as short, in order to get  ̆  ̄  ̆  ̄ instead
of  ̄  ̄  ̆  ̄, which is perfectly legitimate at the end of an Ush*n*ih.

2\. The long î and û are treated as short, not only before vowels, which
is legitimate, but also before consonants.

VII, 62, 4. dyâ̄vâ̄bhû̄mî̄ ădĭtē trâ̄s̍î̄̆thâ̄*m* nā*h* (see Trish*t*. § 5).

The forms î̄*s*î̄yā and râ̄sî̄yā in VII, 32, 18, occur at the end of
octosyllabic or Gâyatra pâdas, and are therefore

<span id="page_cviii">p. cviii</span>

perfectly legitimate, yet Professor Kuhn would change them too, into
î̄*s*î̆yā and râ̄sî̆yā. In VII, 28, 4, even mâyî is treated as mâ̄yî̆ (see
Trish*t*. § 5); and in VII, 68, 1, vî̄tām as vî̆tām. If, in explanation of
this shortening of vîtam, vîhi is quoted, which is identified with vĭhi,
this can hardly be considered as an argument, for vĭhĭ occurs where no
short syllable is required, IV, 48, 1; II, 26, 2; and where, therefore,
the shortening of the vowel cannot be attributed to metrical reasons.

3\. Final m followed by an initial consonant is allowed to make no
position, and even in the middle of a word a nasal followed by a liquid
is supposed to make positio debilis. Several of the instances, however,
given in support, are from Gâyatra pâdas, where Professor Kuhn, in some
of his later articles, has himself allowed greater latitude; others
admit of different scanning, as for instance,

I, 117, 8. măhā*h* kshō*n*āsyă ā*s*vĭnâ̄ kā*n*vâ̄yā.

Here, even if we considered the dispondeus as illegitimate, we might
scan kă͡*n*v̆<span class="small">\*</span>â̄yă, for this scanning occurs in
other places, while to treat the first a as short before *n*v seems
tantamount to surrendering all rules of prosody.

4\. Final n before semivowels, mutes, and double n before vowels make no
position <span id="fr_61"></span>[a](#fn_52). Ex. III, 49, I. yāsmī̆n
vī*s*vâ̄ (Trish*t*. § 5);. I, 174, 5. yāsmĭ̄*ñ* *k*â̄kān; I, 186, 4.
sāsmĭn(n) û̄dhān <span id="fr_62"></span>[b](#fn_53).

5\. Final Visarga before sibilants makes no position <span
id="fr_63"></span>[c](#fn_54). Ex. IV, 21, 10. sātyă̄h sāmrâ̄*t*
(Trish*t*. § 5). Even in I, 63, 4.

<span id="page_cix">p. cix</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *k*ōdî̆̅*h* să̅khâ̄
(probably a *G*âgata), and V, 82, 4. sâ̄vî̄̆h sāubhăgām (a Gây. § 7), the
long î is treated as short, and the short a of sakhâ is lengthened,
because an aspirate follows.

6\. S before mutes makes no position. Ex. VI, 66, II. ūgrâ̄ ā̆sp*ri*dhrān
(Trish*t*. § 3).

7\. *S* before *k* makes no position. Ex. vī*s*vā̆*sk*āndrâ̄*h*, &c.

8\. Mutes before s make no position. Ex. rā̆kshās, according to Professor
Kuhn, in the seventh Ma*nd*ala only, but see I, 12, 5; kū̆tsa, &c.

9\. Mutes before r or v make no position. Ex. sŭ*s*ī̆prā, dî̄rghā̆*s*rūt.

10\. Sibilants before y make no position. Ex. dā̆syû̄n.

11\. R followed by mutes or sibilants makes no position. Ex. â̄yū̆r
*g*î̄văsē, *kh*ā̆rdī*h*, vā̆rshīsh*th*ām.

12\. Words like smā̆ddīsh*t*î̄n, &c. retain their vowel short before two
following consonants.

We now proceed to consider a number of prosodial rules which Professor
Kuhn proposes to repeal in order to have a long syllable where the MSS.
supply a short:

1\. The vowel *ri* is to be pronounced as long, or rather as ar. Ex. I,
12, 9. tāsmāi pâ̄văkă m*rĭl*ăyā is to be read mārdăyā; V, 33, 10.
sā*m*vără*n*āsyă *rĭ*shē*h* is to be read arshe*h*. But why not
sāmvără*n*āsy͡ ̄ *ri*<span class="small">\*</span>shē*h* (i. e.
siarshe*h*)?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_50"></span>[civ:a](sbe3213.htm#fr_59) See some important
remarks on these varieties in Mr. J. Boxwell's article 'On the
Trish*t*ubh Metre,' Journal Asiat. Soc. Beng., 1885, p. 79.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[cvii:a](sbe3213.htm#fr_60) A very strong
divergence of opinion is expressed on this point by Professor Bollensen.
He says: 'O und E erst später in die Schrifttafel aufgenommen, bewahren
ihre Länge durch das ganze indische Schriftenthum bis ins Apabhra*ms*a
hinab. Selbstverständlich kann kurz o und e im Veda erst recht nicht
zugelassen werden.' Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. xxii, p. 574.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[cviii:a](sbe3213.htm#fr_61) Professor Kuhn has
afterwards (Beiträge, vol. iv, p. 207) modified this view, and instead
of allowing a final nasal vowel followed by a mute to make positio
debilis, he thinks that the nasal should in most cases be omitted
altogether.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[cviii:b](sbe3213.htm#fr_62) Here a distinction
should be made, I think, between an n before a consonant, and a final n
following a short vowel, which, according to the rules of Sandhi, is
doubled, if a vowel follows. In the latter case, the vowel before the n
remains, no doubt, short in many cases, or, more correctly, the doubling
of the n does not take place, e. g. I, 63, 4; 186, 4. In other places,
the doubling seems preferable, e*g*. I, 33, 11, though Professor Kuhn
would remove it altogether. Kuhn, Beiträge, vol. iii, p. 125.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[cviii:c](sbe3213.htm#fr_63) Here, too,
according to later researches, Professor Kuhn would rather omit the
final sibilant altogether, loc. cit. vol. iv, p. 207.
