### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 52.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 8-10.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. O *S*yâvâ*s*va, sing boldly with [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:1:1) the
Maruts, the singers who, worthy themselves of sacrifice, rejoice in
their guileless glory [2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:1:2) according to their
nature.

2\. They are indeed boldly the friends of strong power; they on their
march protect all who by themselves are full of daring
[1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:2:1).

3\. Like rushing bulls, these Maruts spring over
[1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:3:1) the dark cows (the clouds)
[2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:3:2), and then we perceive the might of the
Maruts in heaven and on earth.

4\. Let us boldly offer praise and sacrifice to your Maruts, to all them
who protect the generation of men, who protect the mortal from injury.

5\. They who are worthy, bounteous, men of perfect strength, to those
heavenly Maruts who are worthy of sacrifice, praise the sacrifice!

6\. The tall men [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:6:1), coming near with their
bright chains, and their weapon, have hurled forth their spears. Behind
these Maruts there came by itself the splendour of heaven, like laughing
lightnings [2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:6:2).

7\. Those who have grown up on earth, or in the wide sky, or in the
realm of the rivers, or in the abode of the great heaven,

8\. Praise that host of the Maruts, endowed with true strength and
boldness [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:8:1), whether those rushing heroes have
by themselves harnessed (their horses) for triumph,

9\. Or whether these brilliant Maruts have in the (speckled) cloud
clothed themselves in wool [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:9:1), or

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

whether by their strength they cut the mountain asunder with the tire of
their chariot;

10\. Call them comers, or goers, or enterers, or followers, under all
these names, they watch on the straw [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:10:1) for
my sacrifice.

11\. The men (the Maruts) watch, and their steeds watch. Then, so
brilliant are their forms to be seen, that people say, Look at the
strangers [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:11:1)!

12\. In measured steps [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:12:1) and wildly shouting
[2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:12:2) the gleemen [3](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:12:3)
have danced toward the well (the cloud). They who appeared one by one
like thieves, were helpers to me to see the light
[4](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:12:4).

13\. Worship, therefore, O seer, that host of Maruts, and keep and
delight them with your voice, they who are themselves wise
[1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:13:1) poets, tall heroes armed with
lightning-spears.

14\. Approach, O seer, the host of Maruts, as a woman approaches a
friend, for a gift [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:14:1); and you, Maruts, bold
in your strength [2](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:14:2), hasten hither, even from
heaven, when you have been praised by our hymns.

15\. If he, after perceiving them, has approached them as gods with an
offering, then may he for a gift remain united with the brilliant
(Maruts), who by their ornaments are glorious on their march.

16\. They, the wise [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:16:1) Maruts, the lords,
who, when there was inquiry for their kindred, told me of the cow, they
told me of P*ris*ni as their mother, and of the strong Rudra as their
father.

17\. The seven and seven heroes [1](sbe3234.htm#an_5:52:17:1) gave me
each a hundred. On the Yamunâ I clear off glorious wealth in cows, I
clear wealth in horses.

#### NOTES.

This hymn is ascribed to *S*yâvâ*s*va Âtreya. Metre, Anush*t*ubh, 1-5,
7-15; Paṅkti, 6, 16, and 17. Sâya*n*a seems to take verse 16 as an
Anush*t*ubh, which of course is a mistake. No verse of this hymn occurs
in SV., VS., TS., TB., MS., AV.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:52:1:1">1</span>. One expects the dative or
accusative after ar*k*a. The instrumental leaves us no choice but to
translate, 'Sing with the Maruts, who are themselves famous as singers.'
Cf. I, 6, 8; V, 60, 8.

Note <span id="an_5:52:1:2">2</span>. On *s*ráva*h* mádanti, see
Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 75.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_5:52:2:1">1</span>. Dh*ri*shadvínas may also refer to
the Maruts.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:52:3:1">1</span>. One expects ádhi instead of áti,
see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 95 seq.

Note <span id="an_5:52:3:2">2</span>. See note to I, 37, 5; also,
Bartholomae in Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 211. The whole verse has
been discussed by Benfey, Vedica und Verwandtes, p. 152 seq.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_5:52:6:1">1</span>. This verse has been discussed
before, I, 168, 7, note. Benfey (Nachrichten der K. Ges. der Wiss. zu
Göttingen, 1876, 28 Juni; comp. Vedica und Verwandtes, p. 141)
translated it: 'Heran … haben die Helden, die hehren, ihre Speere
geschleudert; ihnen, den Maruts, nach (erheben sich) traun gleichsam
lachende Blitze, erhebt sich selbst des Himmels Glanz.' *Ri*shvâ´*h*
seems here, as in verse 13, to refer to the Maruts, as in IV, 19, I,
rishvám refers to Indra, though it can be used of weapons also, see VI,
18, 10. As to the instrumentalis comitativus in rukmaí*h* and yudhâ´,
see Lanman, p. 335.

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

Note <span id="an_5:52:6:2">2</span>. Benfey's explanation of
*g*á*ghgh*atî*h* is ingenious, though it leaves some difficulties. The
writing of *ghgh* in Devanâgarî may have been meant for *ggh*, as in
akhkhalîk*rí*tya, VII, 103. 3. But there remains the fact that *g*aksh
occurs in the sense of laughing, I, 33, 7, and one does not see why it
should have undergone a Prakritic change in our passage, and not there.
It might be a mimetic word, to express the sound of rattling and
clattering; cf. *g*a*ñg*anâbhávan, VIII, 43, 8.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_5:52:8:1">1</span>. As to the adjective in the
masculine gender after *s*árdhas, see I, 37, 1, note. The meaning of
*rí*bhvas, bold, rabid, is doubtful; see Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 408.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_5:52:9:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a takes Parush*n*î as the
name of one of the rivers of the Punjâb, called the Irâvatî, and at
present the Ravi. Parush*n*î might mean speckled, muddy, as a synonym of
p*ris*ni. Roth has suggested that parush*n*î might here mean cloud. But
what is the meaning of parush*n*î in a similar passage, IV, 22, 2.
(Índra*h*) *s*riyé párush*n*îm ushámâ*n*a*h*–û´r*n*âm yásyâ*h* párvâ*n*i
sakhyâ´ya vivyé? If it means that Indra clothed himself in speckled
wool, that wool might be intended for what we call woolly or fleecy
clouds. As the Maruts often perform the same acts as Indra, we might
read in our verse utá sma té párush*n*îs û´r*n*â*h*, and pronounce utá
sma té párush*n*ia û´r*n*â*h*, though Lanman, p. 395, objects to ias for
îs in the acc. plur. See, however, hetî´*h* ádevî*h* in VIII, 61, 16.
The instrumental singular is possible, but again unusual with vas,
párush*n*yâ û´r*n*â. Possibly the original meaning of parush*n*î may
have been forgotten, and if the name of the river Parush*n*î was
generally known, it might easily have taken the place of parush*n*î, the
cloud. For other explanations see Roth, Über gewisse Kürzungen, Wien,
1887; Bartholomae, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIX, 583; Schmidt, Die
Pluralbildungen der indogermanischen Neutra, 1889, p. 307.

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_5:52:10:1">1</span>. Vish*t*ârá*h* does not occur
again, and Lanman is therefore quite justified in assigning to it the
meaning of straw (p. 339). He paraphrases: 'Let their customs carry them
where they may, yet when I sacrifice, they wait quietly on the straw,
i. e. the altar, for it.' He reads in the Pada text vi-stâré for
vi-stârá*h*. Vish*t*ârín, which occurs AV. IV, 34, 1, does not throw
much light on the exact meaning of vish*t*âra in this place. If we
retain Vish*t*ârá*h*, the nominative, we must assign to it the meaning
of crowd, and refer it to the Maruts.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_5:52:11:1">1</span>. Pârâvata is a turtle-dove (VS.
XXIV, 25), and it is just possible that the Maruts might have been
compared to them. But pârâvata is used in VIII, 100, 6, as an epithet of
vasu, wealth, and in VIII, 34, 18, we read of râtis (not râtris), i. e.
gifts of Pârâvata. The river Sarasvatî is called pârâvataghnî, killing
Pârâvata, VI, 61, 2, and in the Pa*ñk*av. Br. IX, 4, 1I, we hear that
Tura*s*ravas and the Pârâvatas offered their Somas together. I am
therefore inclined to take Pârâvata, lit. distant people, extranei,
strangers, as a name of an Aryan border clan with whom the Vedic Aryas
were sometimes at war, sometimes at peace. In that case the
frontier-river, the Sarasvatî, might be called the destroyer or enemy of
the Pârâvatas. As their wealth and gifts have been mentioned, to compare
the Maruts with the Pârâvatas may mean no more than that the Maruts also
are rich and generous. Ludwig thinks of the Παρυῆται, which seems more
doubtful. For a different interpretation see Delbrück, Syntax, p. 531.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_5:52:12:1">1</span>. I take *kh*anda*h*stúbh in the
sense of stepping (according to) a measure, as explained in my Preface
(1st ed.), [p. cii](sbe3213.htm#page_cii), though I do not doubt that
that meaning was afterwards forgotten, and replaced by the technical
meaning of stubh, to shout. See Böhtlingk-Roth, s. v. stubh, and

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

stobhagrantha, Sâma-veda, Bibl. Ind., II, p. 519. It can hardly be
supposed that such artificial performances of Vedic hymns, as are
preserved in the Sâma-veda, could have suggested the first names of the
ancient metres.

Note <span id="an_5:52:12:2">2</span>. Kubhanyú can only be derived from
bhan, to shout.

Note <span id="an_5:52:12:3">3</span>. The kîrí*n*a*h* are probably
intended here for strolling minstrels who, when they approached the well
of a village (here the cloud), might be taken either for friends or
foes.

Note <span id="an_5:52:12:4">4</span>. D*ris*í tvishé. Grassmann
translates: 'Wie Räuberbanden schienen sie geschart zum Andrang meinem
Blick.' Ludwig better: 'Helfer waren sie, glanz zu sehn.' We must either
read d*ris*é tvishé, to see the light, or d*ris*é tvishí, to be seen by
light. See, however, P. G., Ved. Stud. p. 225.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_5:52:13:1">1</span>. Vedhas, wise. The different
possible meanings of this word have been discussed by Ludwig,
Z. D. M. G. XL, p. 716; and by Bartholomae, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift,
XXVII, p. 361.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_5:52:14:1">1</span>. On dânâ´, see Lanman, pp. 533,
335; P. G., Ved. Stud. p. 101.

Note <span id="an_5:52:14:2">2</span>. Dh*ri*sh*n*ava*h* ó*g*asâ to be
read   ̄  ̆  ̄  ̆  ̄.

##### Verse 15.

This verse, as Roth says, is very obscure, and the translation is purely
tentative. Grassmann derives vakshá*n*â from vah in the sense of an
offering. It may more easily be derived from vaksh, i. e. what gives
increase, and be taken as an instrumental. Pischel shows that in many
passages vaksha*n*â in the plural has the meaning of yoni, also of the
yoni on the altar. But even this meaning does not throw much light on
our passage. The first pâda may possibly be taken in an interrogative
and conditional sense, or we may translate: 'Now, having perceived them,
may he, as a refreshing draught goes to the gods, come

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

together with the Maruts for his reward.' Whatever the verse may mean,
eshâm devâ´n cannot mean the gods of the Maruts, or prove the existence
of idols, as Bollensen (Z. D. M. G. XXII, 587) and even Muir (S. T. V,
454) imagined. The translation of Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 101, sûríbhi*h*
a*ñg*íbhi*h* mit 'Herren, die schmieren, d. h. ordentlich bezahlen,'
seems too exclusively German. Could a*ñg*in be an adjective, in the
sense of possessed of a*ñg*is?

##### Verse 16.

Note <span id="an_5:52:16:1">1</span>. If *s*íkvas is not to be derived
from *s*ak (see Hübschmann, Vocalsystem, pp. 64, 186), we should have to
derive ni*s*, night, from a root altogether different from that which
yields nakt, nákta, &c. But how does *s*íkvas come to mean, according to
Ludwig, both bunch of flowers, and flaming? Does he connect it with
*s*ikhâ? Surely, if *s*iksh may stand for *s*i*s*ak-s, why not *s*ik-vas
for \**s*i*s*akvas? 'Bright' leaves it doubtful whether it means clever
or flaming.

##### Verse 17.

Note <span id="an_5:52:17:1">1</span>. The seven, seven heroes need not
be the Maruts, but some liberal patrons who rewarded *S*yâvâ*s*va. See
Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 371.
