<p>I begin with some mistakes of my own, mistakes which I might have avoided, if I had always consulted the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, where single words or whole passages of the Veda are quoted. Some of these mistakes have been removed by Professor Aufrecht, others, however, appear in his transcript as they appear in my own edition.</p>  
<p>I need hardly point out passages where palpable misprints in my edition have been repeated in Professor Aufrecht's text. I mean by palpable misprints, cases where a glance at the Pada text or at the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text or a reference to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's commentary would show at once what was intended. Thus, for instance, in VI, 15, 3. v<I>ri</I>dh&eacute;, as I had printed in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, was clearly a misprint for v<I>ri</I>dh&oacute;, as may be seen from the Pada, which gives v<I>ri</I>dh&aacute;<I>h</I>, and from S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a. Here, though Professor Aufrecht repeats v<I>ri</I>dh&eacute;, I think it hardly necessary to show that the authority of the best MSS. (S 2 alone contains a correction of v<I>ri</I>dh&oacute; to v<I>ri</I>dh&eacute;) is in favour of v<I>ri</I>dh&aacute;<I>h</I>, whatever we may think of the relative value of these two readings. One must be careful, however, in a text like that of the Vedic hymns, where the presence or absence of a single letter or accent begins to become</p>  
<p><a name="page_lvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lvi</font></A></p>  
<p>the object of the most learned and painstaking discussions, not to claim too large an indulgence for misprints. A misprint in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, if repeated in the Pada, or if admitted even in the commentary of S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, though it need not be put down to the editor's deplorable ignorance, becomes yet a serious matter, and I willingly take all the blame which is justly due for occasional accidents of this character. Such are, for instance, II, 12, 14, <I>s</I>a<I>s</I>am&acirc;n&aacute;m instead of <I>s</I>a<I>s</I>am&aacute;n&acirc;m; I, 124, 4, <I>s</I>udhy&uacute;va<I>h</I>, in the Pada, instead of <I>s</I>undhy&uacute;va<I>h</I>; and the substitution in several places of a short u instead of a long &ucirc; in such forms as <I>s</I>&ucirc;<I>s</I>&aacute;v&acirc;ma, when occurring in the Pada; cf. I, 166, 14; 167, 9.</p>  
<p>It is clear from the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, S&ucirc;tra 819 and 163, 5, that the words &ucirc;t&icirc;&acute; &iacute;ndra in IV, 29, I, should not be joined together, but that the hiatus should remain. Hence &ucirc;t&icirc;&acute;ndra, as printed in my edition and repeated in Professor Aufrecht's, should be corrected, and the hiatus be preserved, as it is in the fourth verse of the same hymn, &ucirc;t&icirc;&acute; itth&acirc;&acute;. MSS. S 1, S 3 are right; in S 2 the words are joined.</p>  
<p>It follows from S&ucirc;tra 799 that to double the y in vaiya<I>s</I>va is a mistake, but a mistake which had to be pointed out and guarded against as early as the time of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya. In VIII, 26, 11, therefore, vaiyya<I>s</I>v&aacute;sya, as printed in my edition and repeated in Professor Aufrecht's, should be changed to vaiya<I>s</I>v&aacute;sya. MSS. S 1, S 3 are right, likewise P 1, P 2; but S 2 has the double mistake vayya<I>s</I>v&aacute;sya, as described in the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya; another MS. of Wilson's has vaiyy. The same applies to VIII, 23, 24, and VIII, 24, 23. P 1 admits the mistaken spelling vayya<I>s</I>va.</p>  
<p>Some corrections that ought to be made in the Padap&acirc;<I>th</I>a only, as printed in my edition, are pointed out in a note to S&ucirc;tra 738 of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya. Thus, according to S&ucirc;tra 583, 6, <I>s</I>r&ucirc;y&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> in the Pada text of II, 10, 2, should be changed to <I>s</I>ruy&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>. MSS. P 1, P 2 have the short u.</p>  
<p>In V, 7, 8, I had printed <I>s</I>&uacute;<I>k</I>i<I>h</I> shma, leaving the a of</p>  
<p><a name="page_lvii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lvii</font></A></p>  
<p>shma short in accordance with the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, S&ucirc;tra 514, where a string of words is given before which sma must not be lengthened, and where under No. 11 we find y&aacute;smai. Professor Aufrecht has altered this, and gives the &acirc; as long, which is wrong. The MSS. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the short a.</p>  
<p>Another word before which sma ought not to be lengthened is m&acirc;&acute;vate. Hence, according to S&ucirc;tra 514, 14, I ought not to have printed in VI, 65, 4, shm&acirc; m&acirc;&acute;vate, but shma m&acirc;&acute;vate. Here Professor Aufrecht has retained the long &acirc;, which is wrong. MSS. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the short a.</p>  
<p>It follows from S&ucirc;tra 499 that in I, 138, 4, we should not lengthen the vowel of s&uacute;. Hence, instead of asy&acirc;&acute; &ucirc; sh&ucirc;&acute; <I>n</I>a &uacute;pa s&acirc;t&aacute;ye, as printed in my edition and repeated by Professor Aufrecht, we should read asy&acirc;&acute; &ucirc; sh&uacute; <I>n</I>a &uacute;pa s&acirc;t&aacute;ye. S 1, S 2, S 3 have short u&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>In VII, 31, 4, I had by mistake printed viddh&iacute; instead of viddh&icirc;&acute;. The same reading is adopted by Professor Aufrecht (II, p. 24), but the authority of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, S&ucirc;tra 445, can hardly be overruled. S 1, S 2, S 3 have viddh&icirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>While in cases like these, the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya is an authority which, as far as I can judge, ought to overrule the authority of every MS., however ancient, we must in other cases depend either on the testimony of the best MSS. or be guided, in fixing on the right reading, by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a and the rules of grammar. I shall therefore, in cases where I cannot consider Professor Aufrecht's readings as authoritative improvements, have to give my reasons why I adhere to the readings which I had originally adopted.</p>  
<p>In V, 9, 4, I had printed by mistake pur&uacute; y&oacute; instead of pur&ucirc;&acute; y&oacute;. I had, however, corrected this misprint in my edition of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, 393, 532. Professor Aufrecht decides in favour of pur&uacute; with a short u, but against the authority of the MSS., S 1, S 2, S 3, which have pur&ucirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_lviii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lviii</font></A></p>  
<p>It was certainly a great mistake of mine, though it may seem more excusable in a Romanised transcript, that I did not follow the writers of the best MSS. in their use of the Avagraha, or, I should rather say, of that sign which, as far as the Veda is concerned, is very wrongly designated by the name of Avagraha. Avagraha, according to the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, never occurs in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text, but is the name given to that halt, stoppage, or pause which in the Pada text separates the component parts of compound words. That pause has the length of one short vowel, i.&nbsp;e. one m&acirc;tr&acirc;. Of course, nothing is said by the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya as to how the pause should be represented graphically, but it is several times alluded to as of importance in the recitation and accentuation of the Veda. What we have been in the habit of calling Avagraha is by the writers of certain MSS. of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text used as the sign of the Viv<I>ri</I>tti or hiatus. This hiatus, however, is very different from the Avagraha, for while the Avagraha has the length of one m&acirc;tr&acirc;, the Viv<I>ri</I>tti or hiatus has the length of &frac14; m&acirc;tr&acirc;, if the two vowels are short; of &frac12; m&acirc;tr&acirc;, if either vowel is long; of &frac34; m&acirc;tr&acirc;, if both vowels are long. Now I have several times called attention to the fact that though this hiatus is marked in certain MSS. by the sign <FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>, I have in my edition omitted it, because I thought that the hiatus spoke for itself and did not require a sign to attract the attention of European readers; while, on the contrary, I have inserted that sign where MSS. hardly ever use it, viz. when a short initial a is elided after a final e or o; (see my remarks on pp. 36, 39. of my edition of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya.) Although I thought, and still think, that this use of the sign . is more useful for practical purposes, yet I regret that, in this one particular, I should have deviated from the authority of the best MSS., and caused some misunderstandings on the part of those who have made use of my edition. If, for instance, I had placed the sign of the Viv<I>ri</I>tti, the <FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>, in its proper place, or if, at least, I had not inserted it where, as we say. The initial a has been elided after e or o, Professor Bollensen would have seen at once that the authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khyas fully agree with him in looking on this change, not as an</p>  
<p><a name="page_lix"><font size="1" color="green">p. lix</font></A></p>  
<p>elision, but as a contraction. If, as sometimes happens, final o or e remain unchanged before initial short a, this is called the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;la and Pr&acirc;<I>k</I>ya padav<I>ri</I>tti (Sutra 137). If, on the contrary, final o or e become one (ek&icirc;bhavati) with the initial short a, this is called the Abhinihita sandhi (Sutra 138). While the former, the hiatus of the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;la and Eastern schools, is marked by the writers of several MSS. by the sign <FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>, the Abhinihita sandhi, being a sandhi, is not marked by any sign&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>I, 3, 12. r&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>ati (Aufr. p. 2) instead of r&acirc;<I>g</I>ati (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 75) is wrong.</p>  
<p>I, 7, 9. ya &eacute;ka<I>h</I> (Aufr. p. 5) should be ya. &eacute;ka<I>h</I> (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 110), because the relative pronoun is never without an accent. The relative particle yath&acirc; may be without an accent, if it stands at the end of a p&acirc;da; and though there are exceptions to this rule, yet in VIII, 21, 5, where Professor Aufrecht gives yath&acirc;, the MSS. are unanimous in favour of yath&acirc; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 480). See Phi<I>t</I>-sutra, ed. Kielhorn, p. 54.</p>  
<p>I, 10, 11. &acirc; t&ucirc;&acute; (Aufr. p. 7) should be &acirc;&acute; t&ucirc;&acute; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 139), because &acirc; is never without the accent.</p>  
<p>I, 10, 12. <I>g</I>&uacute;sh<I>t</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>, which Professor Aufrecht specially mentions as having no final Visarga in the Pada, has the Visarga in all the MSS., (Aufr. p. 7, M.&nbsp;M. vol. i. p. 140.)</p>  
<p>I, 11, 4. k&aacute;vir (Aufr. p. 7) should be kav&iacute;r (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 143).</p>  
<p>I, 22, 8, read r&acirc;&acute;dh&acirc;<I>m</I>si.</p>  
<p>I, 40, 1 and 6. There is no excuse for the accent either on tv&eacute;mahe or on v&oacute;<I>k</I>ema, while s&aacute;<I>k</I>&acirc;n&#784; in I, 51, 11, ought to have the accent on the first syllable.</p>  
<p>I, 49, 3. Rosen was right in not eliding the a in div&oacute; &aacute;ntebhya<I>h</I>. S 1, S 2,<I>S</I> 3 preserve the initial a, nor does the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya anywhere provide for its suppression.</p>  
<p>I, 54, 8. ksh&aacute;tram (Aufr. p. 46) is a mere misprint for kshatr&aacute;m.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_lx"><font size="1" color="green">p. lx</font></A></p>  
<p>I, 55, 7. vandana<I>s</I>r&uacute;d (Aufr. p. 47) instead of vandana<I>s</I>rud (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 514) is wrong.</p>  
<p>I, 57, 2. sam&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I>&icirc;ta instead of sam&aacute;<I>s</I>&icirc;ta had been corrected in my reprint of the first Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala, published at Leipzig. See Bollensen, Zeitschrift der D.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G., vol. xxii, p. 626.</p>  
<p>I, 61, 7, read v&iacute;sh<I>n</I>u<I>h</I>; I, 64, 2, read <I>s</I>&uacute;<I>k</I>aya<I>h</I>; I, 64, 5, read dh&ucirc;&acute;taya<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>I, 61, 16. Rosen had rightly printed h&acirc;riyo<I>g</I>an&acirc; with a long &acirc; both in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; and Pada texts, and I ought not to have given the short a instead. All the MSS., S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1, and P 2, give the long &acirc;. Professor Aufrecht gives the short a in the Pada, which is wrong.</p>  
<p>I, 67, 2 (4). vid&aacute;nt&icirc;m (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 595) is perfectly right, as far as the authority of the MSS. and of S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a is concerned, and should not have been altered to vind&aacute;nt&icirc;m (Aufr. p. 57).</p>  
<p>I, 72, 2, read vats&aacute;m; I, 72, 6, read pas&ucirc;&acute;&ntilde;; I, 76, 3, read dh&aacute;kshy; I, 82, 1, read yad&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>I, 83, 3. Rosen was right in giving &aacute;sa<I>m</I>yatta<I>h</I>. I gave &aacute;sa<I>m</I>yata<I>h</I> on the authority of P 1, but all the other MSS. have tt.</p>  
<p>I, 84, 1. indra (Aufr. p. 68) cannot have the accent on the first syllable, because it does not stand at the beginning of a p&acirc;da (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 677). The same applies to &iacute;ndra, VI, 41, 4, (Aufr. pt 429) instead of indra (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 734); to &aacute;gne, I, 140, 12, (Aufr. p. 130) instead of agne (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 133). In III, 36, 3, on the contrary, indra, being at the head of a p&acirc;da, ought to have the accent on the first syllable, &iacute;ndra (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 855), not indra (Aufr. p. 249). The same mistake occurs again, III, 36, 10 (Aufr. p. 250); IV, 32, 7, (Aufr. p. 305); IV, 32, 12, (Aufr. p. 305); VIII, 3, 12, (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 86). In V, 61, 1, nara<I>h</I> should have no accent; whereas in VII, 91, 3, it should have the accent on the first syllable. In VIII, 8, 19, vipany&ucirc; should have no accent, and Professor Aufrecht gives it correctly in the notes, where he has likewise very properly removed the Avagraha which I had inserted.</p>  
<p>I, 88, 1, read y&acirc;ta (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 708), not y&acirc;tha (Aufr. p. 72).</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxi</font></A></p>  
<p>I, 90, 1, read <I>ri</I><I>g</I>un&icirc;t&icirc;&acute;; I, 94, 11, read yavas&acirc;&acute;do (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 766), not yavas&acirc;&acute;do (Aufr. p. 80).</p>  
<p>I, 118, 9. abhibh&ucirc;&acute;tim (Aufr. p. 105) instead of abh&iacute;bh&ucirc;tim (M.&nbsp;M. vol. i, p. 957) cannot be right, considering that in all other passages abh&iacute;bh&ucirc;ti has the accent on the second syllable. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the accent on the i.</p>  
<p>I, 128, 4. gh<I>ri</I>ta<I>s</I>r&icirc;r (Aufr. p. 117) instead of gh<I>ri</I>ta<I>s</I>r&icirc;&acute;r (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 52) is wrong.</p>  
<p>I, 144, 2, read p&aacute;r&icirc;v<I>ri</I>t&acirc;<I>h</I> (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 155) instead of par&icirc;&acute;v<I>ri</I>t&acirc;<I>h</I> (Aufr. p. 133).</p>  
<p>I, 145, 5. Professor Aufrecht (p. 134) gives upamasy&acirc;&acute;m, both in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; and Pada texts, as having the accent on the last syllable. I had placed the accent on the penultimate, (Pada, upa-m&aacute;sy&acirc;m, vol. ii, p. 161,) and whatever may be the reading of other MSS., this is the only possible accentuation. S 1, S 2, S 3 have the right accent.</p>  
<p>I, 148, 4. p&ucirc;r&ucirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i (Aufr. p. 136) instead of pur&ucirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 170) does not rest, as far as I know, on the authority of any MSS. S 1, S 2, S 3 have pur&ucirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i.</p>  
<p>I, 151, 7. ga<I>k</I><I>kh</I>atho (Aufr. p. 137) should be g&aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>atho (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 181).</p>  
<p>I, 161, 12. All the Pada MSS. read pr&aacute; &aacute;brav&icirc;t, separating the two words and accentuating each. Though the accent is irregular, yet, considering the peculiar construction of the verse, in which pra and pro are used as adverbs rather than as prepositions, I should not venture with Professor Aufrecht (p. 144) to write pr&aacute; abrav&icirc;t. The MSS. likewise have &acirc;&acute; &aacute;<I>g</I>agan, I, 161, 4; and pr&aacute; &aacute;g&acirc;<I>h</I>, VIII, 48, 2, not pr&aacute; ag&acirc;<I>h</I>, as Aufrecht gives in his second edition.</p>  
<p>I, 163, 11. dhr&aacute;<I>g</I>&icirc;man (Aufr. p. 147) instead of dhr&aacute;<I>g</I>&icirc;<I>m</I>&acirc;n (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 245) is wrong.</p>  
<p>I, 163, 13. gamy&acirc; (Aufr. p. 148) instead of gamy&acirc;&acute; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 246) is wrong.</p>  
<p>I, 164, 17, read p&aacute;re<I>n</I>a (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 259) instead of par&eacute;<I>n</I>a (Aufr. p. 149).</p>  
<p>I, 164, 38. The first <I>k</I>iky&uacute;<I>h</I> ought to have the accent, and has it in all the MSS., (Aufr. p. 151, M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 278.)</p>  
<p>I, 165, 5. A mere change of accent may seem a small</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxii</font></A></p>  
<p>matter, yet it is frequently of the highest importance in the interpretation of the Veda. Thus in I, 165, 5, I had, in accordance with the MSS. S 1, S 2, S 3, printed &eacute;t&acirc;n (vol. ii, p. 293) with the accent on the first syllable. Professor Aufrecht alters this into et&acirc;&acute;n (p. 153), which, no doubt, would be the right form, if it were intended for the accusative plural of the pronoun, but not if it is meant, as it is here, for the accusative plural of &eacute;ta, the speckled deer of the Maruts.</p>  
<p>I, 165, 15. y&acirc;sish<I>t</I>a (Aufr. p. 154) instead of y&acirc;s&icirc;sh<I>t</I>a (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 298) is not supported by any MS.</p>  
<p>I, 169, 7, instead of patay&aacute;nta (Aufr. p. 158), read pat&aacute;yanta (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 322).</p>  
<p>I, 174, 7. k&uacute;y&acirc;v&acirc;<I>k</I>am (Aufr. p. 162) should be k&uacute;yav&acirc;<I>k</I>am (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 340).</p>  
<p>I, 177, 1. yukt&acirc;&acute;, which I had adopted from MS. S 3 (prima manu), is not supported by other MSS., though P 2 reads yuttk&acirc;&acute;. Professor Aufrecht, who had retained yukt&acirc;&acute; in the text, has afterwards corrected it to yuktv&acirc;&acute;, and in this he was right. In I, 177, 2, g&acirc;hi for y&acirc;hi is wrong.</p>  
<p>I, 188, 4. astri<I>n</I>an (Aufr. p. 171) instead of ast<I>ri</I><I>n</I>an (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 395) can only be a misprint.</p>  
<p>II, 29, 6. k&aacute;rt&acirc;d (Aufr. p. 203) instead of kart&acirc;&acute;d (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 560) is wrong.</p>  
<p>II, 40, 4. <I>k</I>akra (Aufr. p. 214) instead of <I>k</I>akr&aacute; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 614) is wrong.</p>  
<p>III, 7, 7. gu<I>h</I> (Aufr. p. 226) instead of g&uacute;<I>h</I> (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 666) is wrong; likewise III, 30, 10, g&acirc;<I>h</I> (Aufr. p. 241) instead of g&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 792).</p>  
<p>III, 17, 1. i<I>g</I>yate (Aufr. p. 232) instead of a<I>g</I>yate (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 722) is impossible.</p>  
<p>III, 47, 1. Professor Aufrecht (p. 256) puts the nominative &iacute;ndro instead of the vocative indra, which I had given (vol. ii, p. 902). I doubt whether any MSS. support that change (S 1, S 2, S 3 have indra), but it is clear that S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a takes indra as a vocative, and likewise the Nirukta.</p>  
<p>III, 50, 2. Professor Aufrecht (p. 258) gives asya, both in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; and Pada, without the accent on the last syllable. But all the MSS. that I know (S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1,</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxiii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxiii</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> P 2) give it with the accent on the last syllable (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 912), and this no doubt is right. The same mistake occurs again in III, 51, 10, (Aufr. p. 259); IV, 5, 11, (Aufr. p. 281); IV, 36, 2, (Aufr. p. 309); V, 12, 3, (Aufr. p. 337); while in VIII, 103, 9, (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 195) the MSS. consistently give asya as unaccented, whereas Professor Aufrecht, in this very passage, places the accent on the last syllable. On the same page (p. 259) amandan, in the Pada, is a misprint for &aacute;mandan.</p>  
<p>III, 53, 18. asi (Aufr. p. 262) instead of &aacute;si (M.&nbsp;M. vol. ii, p. 934) is wrong, because h&iacute; requires that the accent should remain on &aacute;si. S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1, P 2 have &aacute;si.</p>  
<p>IV, 4, 7. sv&aacute; &acirc;&acute;yushe (Aufr. p. 279) instead of sv&aacute; &acirc;&acute;yushi (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 37) is not supported by any good MSS., nor required by the sense of the passage. S 1, S 2, S 3, P 1, P 2 have &acirc;&acute;yushi.</p>  
<p>IV, 5, 7. &aacute;rupitam, in the Pada, (Aufr. p. 280) instead of &acirc;&acute;rupitam (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 45) is right, as had been shown in the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, S&ucirc;tra 179, though by a misprint the long &acirc; of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; had been put in the place of the short a of the Pada.</p>  
<p>IV, 5, 9. read ga&uacute;<I>h</I> (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 46) instead of g&oacute;<I>h</I> (Aufr. p. 281).</p>  
<p>IV, 15, 2. y&acirc;&acute;ti, with the accent on the first syllable, is supported by all MSS. against y&acirc;ti (Aufr. p. 287). The same applies to y&acirc;&acute;ti in IV, 29, 2, and to v&aacute;rante in IV, 31, 9.</p>  
<p>IV, 18, 11. am&icirc;, without any accent (Aufr. p. 293), instead of am&icirc;&acute; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 105) is wrong, because am&icirc;&acute; is never unaccented.</p>  
<p>IV, 21, 9. no, without an accent (Aufr. p. 296), instead of n&oacute; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 120) is wrong.</p>  
<p>IV, 26, 3. &aacute;tithigvam (Aufr. p. 300) instead of atithigv&aacute;m (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 140) and VI, 47, 22, &aacute;tithigvasya (Aufr. p. 437) instead of atithigv&aacute;sya (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 776) are wrong, far atithigv&aacute; never occurs again except with the accent on the last syllable. The MSS. do not vary. Nor do they vary in the accentuation of k&uacute;tsa: hence kuts&aacute;m (Aufr. p. 300) should be k&uacute;tsam (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii p. 139).</p>  
<p><a name="page_xliv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xliv</font></A></p>  
<p>IV, 36, 6. Professor Aufrecht (p. 309) has altered the accent of &acirc;&acute;vishu<I>h</I> into &acirc;vish&uacute;<I>h</I>, but the MSS. are unanimous in favour of &acirc;&acute;vishu<I>h</I> (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 181).</p>  
<p>Again in IV, 41, 9, the MSS. support the accentuation of &aacute;gman (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 200), while Professor Aufrecht (p. 313) has altered it to agman.</p>  
<p>IV, 42, 9. &aacute;d&acirc;<I>s</I>at, being preceded by h&iacute;, ought to have the accent; (Aufrecht, p. 314, has ad&acirc;<I>s</I>at without the accent.) For the same reason, V, 29, 3, &aacute;vindat (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 342) ought not to have been altered to avindat (Aufr. p. 344).</p>  
<p>IV, 50, 4. vy&oacute;man is a misprint for vy&ograve;man.</p>  
<p>V, 15, 5. Professor Aufrecht (p. 338) writes d&icirc;rgh&aacute;m instead of d&oacute;gham (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 314). This, no doubt, was done intentionally, and not by accident, as we see from the change of accent. But d&oacute;gham, though it occurs but once, is supported in this place by all the best MSS., and has been accepted by Professor Roth in his Dictionary.</p>  
<p>V, 34, 4. pr&aacute;yato (Aufr. p. 351) instead of pr&aacute;yat&acirc; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 371) is wrong.</p>  
<p>V, 42, 9. vis&aacute;rm&acirc;<I>n</I>am (Aufr. p. 358) instead of visarm&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>am (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 402) is wrong.</p>  
<p>V, 44, 4. parva<I>n</I>&eacute; (Aufr. p. 360) instead of prava<I>n</I>&eacute; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 415) is wrong.</p>  
<p>V, 83, 4. v&acirc;nti (Aufr. p. 389) instead of v&acirc;&acute;nti (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 554) is supported by no MSS.</p>  
<p>V, 85, 6. &acirc;s&iacute;<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ant&icirc;<I>h</I> (Aufr. p. 391) instead of &acirc;si<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&aacute;nt&icirc;<I>h</I> (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 560) is not supported either by MSS. or by grammar, as si<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I> belongs to the Tud-class. On the same grounds ish&aacute;yanta<I>h</I>, VI, 16, 27 (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 638), ought not to have been changed to ishay&aacute;nta<I>h</I> (Aufr. p. 408), nor VI, 24, 7, avakar<I>s</I>&aacute;yanti (Ni. M. vol. iii, p. 687) into avak&aacute;r<I>s</I>ayanti (Aufr. p. 418).</p>  
<p>VI,. 46, 10, read girva<I>n</I>as (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 763) instead of g&iacute;rva<I>n</I>as (Aufr. p. 435).</p>  
<p>VI, 60, 10. k<I>ri</I><I>n</I>oti (Aufr. p. 450) instead of k<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&oacute;ti (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iii, p. 839) is wrong.</p>  
<p>VII, 40, 4. aryam&acirc;&acute; &acirc;&acute;pa<I>h</I> (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 35), in the Pada instead of aryam&acirc;&acute; &aacute;pa<I>h</I> (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 81) is wrong.</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxv"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxv</font></A></p>  
<p>VII, 51, 1. &acirc;dity&acirc;n&acirc;&acute;m (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 40) instead of &acirc;dity&acirc;&acute;n&acirc;m (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 103) is wrong.</p>  
<p>VII, 64, 2. i<I>l</I>&acirc;&acute;m (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 50) instead of &iacute;<I>l</I>&acirc;m (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 146) is wrong. In the same verse gop&acirc;<I>h</I> in the Pada should be changed in my edition to gop&acirc;.</p>  
<p>VII, 66, 5. y&oacute; (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 51) instead of y&eacute; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 151) is indeed supported by S 3, but evidently untenable on account of atip&iacute;prati.</p>  
<p>VII, 72, 3. In abudhran Professor Aufrecht has properly altered the wrong spelling abudhnan; and, as far as the authority of the best MSS. is concerned (S 1, S 2, S 3), he is also right in putting a final n, although Professor Bollensen prefers the dental n; (Zeitschrift der D.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G., vol. xxii, p. 599.) The fact is that Vedic MSS. use the Anusv&acirc;ra dot for final nasals before all class-letters, and leave it to us to interpret that dot according to the letter which follows. Before I felt quite certain on this point, I have in several cases retained the dot, as given by the MSS., instead of changing it, as I ought to have done according to my system of writing <A HREF="errata.htm#0">Dev&acirc;nagar&icirc;</A>, into the corresponding nasal, provided it represents an original n. In I, 71, 1, S 2, S 3 have the dot in a<I>g</I>ushran, but S 1 has dental n. In IX, 87, 5, as<I>ri</I>gran has the dot; i.&nbsp;e. S 1 has the dot, and n<I>kh</I>, dental n joined to <I>kh</I>; S 2 has n<I>kh</I> without the dot before the n; S 3 has the dot, and then <I>kh</I>. In IV, 24, 6, the spelling of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; &aacute;vivena<I>m</I> t&aacute;m would leave it doubtful whether we ought to read &aacute;vivenan t&aacute;m or &aacute;vivenam t&aacute;m; S 1 and S 3 read &aacute;vivena<I>m</I> t&aacute;<I>m</I>, but S 2 has &aacute;vivenan t&aacute;m; P 2 has &aacute;vi-venan t&aacute;<I>m</I>, and P 1 had the same originally, though a later hand changed it to &aacute;vi-vena<I>m</I> t&aacute;<I>m</I>. In IV, 25, 3, on the contrary, S 1 and S 3 write &aacute;vivena<I>m</I>; S 2, &aacute;vivenam; P i and P 2, &aacute;vi-vena<I>m</I>. What is intended is clear enough, viz. &aacute;vi-venan in IV, 24, 6; &aacute;vi-venam in IV, 25, 3. [In the new edition &aacute;vivenam has been left in both passages.]</p>  
<p>VII, 73 1. a<I>s</I>vin&acirc; (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 56) instead of a<I>s</I>v&iacute;n&acirc; (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 176) is wrong. On the same page, dh&iacute;sh<I>n</I>ye, VII, 72, 3, should have the accent on the first syllable.</p>  
<p>VII, 77, 1. In this verse, which has been so often discussed</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxvi</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (see Kuhn, Beitr&auml;ge, vol. iii, p. 472; B&ouml;htlingk and Roth, Dictionary, vol. ii, p. 968; Bollensen, Orient und Occident, vol. ii, p. 463), all the MSS. which I know, read <I>k</I>ar&acirc;&acute;yai, and not either <I>k</I>ar&acirc;&acute;thai nor <I>g</I>ar&acirc;&acute;yai.</p>  
<p>VIII, 2, 29. k&icirc;r&iacute;<I>n</I>am (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 84) instead of k&acirc;r&iacute;<I>n</I>am (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 308) does not rest on the authority of any MSS., nor is it supported by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>VIII, 9, 9. Professor Aufrecht has altered the very important form &acirc;<I>k</I>u<I>k</I>yuv&icirc;m&aacute;hi (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 389) to &acirc;<I>k</I>u<I>k</I>yav&icirc;m&aacute;hi (vol. ii, p. 98). The question is whether this was done intentionally and on the authority of any MSS. My own MSS. support the form &acirc;<I>k</I>ukyuv&icirc;m&aacute;hi, and I see that Professor Roth accepts this form.</p>  
<p>VIII, 32, 14. &acirc;y&aacute;nt&acirc;ram (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 129) instead of &acirc;yant&acirc;&acute;ram (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 567) is wrong.</p>  
<p>VIII, 47, 15. dushv&aacute;pnyam (Aufr. vol. ii, p. 151) is not so correct as du<I>h</I>shv&aacute;pnyam (M.&nbsp;M. vol. iv, p. 660), or, better, dushshv&aacute;pnyam (Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, S&ucirc;tras 255 and 364), though it is perfectly true that the MSS. write dushv&aacute;pnyam.</p>  
<p>[I ought to state that all these errata have been corrected by Professor Aufrecht in his second edition.]</p>  
<p>In the ninth and tenth Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>alas I have not to defend myself, and I need not therefore give a list of the passages where I think that Professor Aufrecht's text is not supported by the best MSS. My own edition of these Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>alas will soon be published, and I need hardly say that where it differs from Professor Aufrecht's text, I am prepared to show that I had the best authorities on my side.</p>  
<p>Professor Aufrecht writes in the second edition of his Romanised text of the Rig-veda (p. iv): 'Um den Herren, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">My own mistakes.</FONT></span>die diese Druckfehler in majorem gloriam suam mit so grosser Schonung hervorgehoben haben, einen Gegendienst zu erweisen, bemerke ich einige derselben.' Dieser Gegendienst, so gut er gemeint war, ist leider nicht sehr bedeutend ausgefallen, auch nicht immer in majorem gloriam Catonis.</p>  
<p>In I, 161, 2, Professor Aufrecht objects to <I>k</I>aturas k<I>ri</I>notana. I felt doubtful about it, and in the commentary I printed <I>k</I>atura<I>h</I> k<I>ri</I><I>n</I>otana. In IV, 33, 5, the reading</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxvii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxvii</font></A></p>  
<p><I>k</I>atus kara is sanctioned by the authority of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, S&ucirc;tra 281, 4.</p>  
<p>In I, 181, 5, Aufrecht prefers mathr&acirc;; S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, B&ouml;htlingk and Roth, and I prefer mathn&acirc;.</p>  
<p>In II, II, 10, he has discovered that <I>g</I>&ucirc;rv&icirc;t was meant for <I>g</I>&ucirc;rv&acirc;t. Whitney still quotes <I>g</I>&ucirc;rv&icirc;t.</p>  
<p>In III, 9, 4, he has discovered that apsu should be <FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>psu; but this had been already corrected.</p>  
<p>In III, 25, 2, the final a of vaha ought to be long in the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;.</p>  
<p>In IV, 19, 4, instead of d<I>ri</I><I>lh</I>&acirc; ni read d<I>ri</I><I>lh</I>&acirc;ni.</p>  
<p>In VII, 33, 2, instead of av<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc; read <FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>v<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc;.</p>  
<p>In VII, 35, 13, the Visarga in devagop&acirc;<I>h</I> should be deleted.</p>  
<p>In VII, 42, 2, the Anusv&acirc;ra in yu<I>m</I>kshv&acirc; should be deleted.</p>  
<p>In VIII, 2, 30, the anud&acirc;ttatara should be shifted from the ultimate to the penultimate, dadhir&eacute;, not dadhire.</p>  
<p>In VIII, 51, 3, avishyanta was meant for arishyantam.</p>  
<p>In VIII, 55, 5, for na read &acirc;. The MSS. vary in both cases.</p>  
<p>In IX, 108, 7, in vanakraksha, the kra was printed as <I>ri</I>. Professor Aufrecht might have seen it correctly printed in the index. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a read vana<I>ri</I>ksha.</p>  
<p>In X, 28, 11, Professor Aufrecht thinks that the Pada should have godh&acirc;<I>h</I> instead of godh&acirc;. I think godh&acirc; is right, in spite of Professor Aufrecht's appeal to the silence of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya. The fact is that godh&acirc;<I>h</I> never occurs, while godh&acirc; occurs in the preceding verse, and again VIII, 69, 9.</p>  
<p>After such a flourish of trumpets, we expected more from Professor Aufrecht; still we must learn to be grateful even for small mercies.</p>
