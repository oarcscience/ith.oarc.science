### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 34.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 7, VARGA 19-21.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. The Maruts charged with rain [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:1.md), endowed
with fierce force, terrible like wild beasts
[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:2), blazing [3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:3.md) in
their strength [4](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:4.md), brilliant like fires, and
impetuous [5](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:5), have uncovered the (rain-giving.md)
cows by blowing away the cloud [6](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:1:6.md).

2\. The (Maruts) with their rings [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:2:1.md) appeared
like the heavens with their stars [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:2:2.md), they
shone wide like streams from clouds as soon as Rudra, the strong man,
was born for you, O golden-breasted Maruts, in the bright lap of
P*ris*ni [3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:2:3.md).

3\. They wash [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:1.md) their horses like racers in
the courses, they hasten with the points of the reed
[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:2.md) on their quick steeds. O golden jawed
[3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:3) Maruts, violently shaking (your jaws.md), you
go quick [4](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:4.md) with your spotted deer
[5](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:3:5.md), being friends of one mind.

4\. Those Maruts have grown to feed [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:4:1.md) all
these beings, or, it may be, (they have come) hither for the sake of a
friend, they who always bring quickening rain. They have spotted horses,
their bounties cannot be taken away, they are like headlong charioteers
on their ways [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:4:2.md).

5\. O Maruts, wielding your brilliant spears, come hither on smooth
[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:5:1.md) roads with your fiery
[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:5:2) cows (clouds.md) whose udders are swelling;
(come hither), being of one mind, like swans toward their nests, to
enjoy the sweet offering.

6\. O one-minded Maruts, come to our prayers, come to our libations like
(Indra) praised by men [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:6:1.md)!

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fulfil (our
prayer) like the udder of a barren cow [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:6:2.md), and
make the prayer glorious by booty to the singer.

7\. Grant us this strong horse for our chariot, a draught
[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:7:1.md) that rouses our prayers, from day to day,
food to the singers, and to the poet in our homesteads
[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:7:2) luck [3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:7:3.md), wisdom,
inviolable and invincible strength.

8\. When the gold-breasted Maruts harness the horses to their chariots,
bounteous [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:8:1.md) in wealth, then it is as if a cow
in the folds poured out [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:8:2.md) to her calf copious
food, to every man who has offered libations.

9\. Whatever mortal enemy may have placed us among wolves
[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:9:1.md), shield us from hurt, ye Vasus! Turn the
wheels with burning heat[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:9:2.md) against him, and
strike down the weapon of the impious fiend, O Rudras!

10\. Your march, O Maruts, appears brilliant, whether even friends have
milked the udder of P*ris*ni, or whether, O sons of Rudra, you mean to
blame him who praises you, and to weaken those who are weakening Trita,
O unbeguiled heroes [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:10:1.md).

11\. We invoke you, the great Maruts, the constant wanderers, at the
offering of the rapid Vish*n*u [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:11:1.md); holding
ladles (full of libations) and prayerful we ask the golden-coloured and
exalted Maruts for glorious wealth.

12\. The Da*s*agvas (Maruts?) [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:12:1.md) carried on
[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:12:2.md) the sacrifice first; may they rouse us at
the break of dawn. Like the dawn, they uncover the dark nights with the
red (rays), the strong ones, with their brilliant light, as with a sea
of milk.

13\. With the (morning) clouds, as if with glittering red ornaments
[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:13:1.md), these Maruts have grown great in the
sacred places [2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:13:2.md). Streaming down with rushing

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

splendour [3](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:13:3.md), they have assumed their bright
and brilliant colour.

14\. Approaching [1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:14:1.md) them for their great
protection to help us, we invoke them with this worship, they whom Trita
may bring near, like the five Hot*ri* priests for victory
[2](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:14:2.md), descending on their chariot to help.

15\. May that grace of yours by which you help the wretched
[1](sbe3233.htm#an_2:34:15:1.md) across all anguish, and by which you
deliver the worshipper from the reviler, come hither, O Maruts; may your
favour approach us like a cow (going to her calf)!

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

#### NOTES.

Hymn ascribed to G*ri*tsamada. Metre, 1-14 Gagatî, 15 Trish*t*ubh,
according to the paribhâshâ in the Sarvânukrama*n*î 12, 13. See also
Ludwig, III, p. 59; Bergaigne, Recherches sur l’histoire de la liturgie
védique, 1889, pp. 66 seq.; Oldenberg, Prolegomena, p. 144. None of its
verses occurs in SV., VS., AV. The first verse is found in TB. II, 5, 5,
4, with three various readings, viz. tavishébhir ûrmíbhi*h* instead of
távishîbhir ar*k*ína*h*, bhrúmim instead of bh*rí*mim, and rípa instead
of ápa.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:34:1:1">1</span>. Dhârâvarâ´*h*, a word of doubtful
import, possibly meaning wishing for rain, or the suitors of the streams
of rain. The Maruts are sometimes represented as varas or suitors; cf.
V, 60, 4.

Note <span id="an_2:34:1:2">2</span>. Cf. II, 33, 11.

Note <span id="an_2:34:1:3">3</span>. Bergaigne, II, 381, translates
ar*k*ína*h* by chantres, singers, deriving it, as it would seem, from
arka which, as he maintains (Journ. Asiat. 1884, IV, pp. 194 seq.),
means always song in the RV. (Rel. Véd. I, 279). This, however, is not
the case, as has been well shown by Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, pp. 23 seq.
Besides, unless we change ar*k*ina*h* into arki*n*a*h*, we must connect
it with ar*k*i, light. Thus we read VIII, 41, 8, ar*k*ínâ padâ´.

Note <span id="an_2:34:1:4">4</span>. Tavishébhir ûrmíbhi*h*, the
reading of the Taittirîyas, is explained by Sâya*n*a by balavadbhir
gamanai*h*. It may have been taken from RV. VI, 61, 2.

Note <span id="an_2:34:1:5">5</span>. On ri*g*îshín, see I, 64,
12<sup>5</sup>; I, 87, I.

Note <span id="an_2:34:1:6">6</span>. Bh*rí*mi seems to me a name of the
cloud, driven about by the wind. The Taittirîyas read bhrúmim, and
Sâya*n*a explains it by megha*m* dharnanta*s* *k*âlayanta*h*. In most
passages, no doubt, bh*ri*mi means quick, fresh, and is opposed to
radhra, IV, 32, 2; VII, 56, 20. In I, 31, 16, as applied to Agni, it may
mean quick. But in our passage that meaning is impossible, and I prefer
the traditional

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

meaning of cloud to that of storm-wind, adopted by Benfey and Roth. The
expression 'to blow a storm-wind' is not usual, while dham is used in
the sense of blowing away clouds and darkness. The cows would then be
the waters in the clouds. It is possible, however, that Sâya*n*a's
explanation, according to which bh*ri*mi is a musical instrument, may
rest on some traditional authority. In this case it would correspond to
dhámanta*h* vâ*n*ám, in I, 85, 10<sup>2</sup>.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_2:34:2:1">1</span>. On khâdin, see I, 166, 9, note 2.
On rukma-vakshas, I, 64, 4, note 1. Golden-breasted is meant for armed
with golden chest-plates. The meaning seems to be that the Maruts with
their brilliant khâdis appear like the heavens with their brilliant
stars. The Maruts are not themselves lightning and rain, but they are
seen in them, as Agni is not the fire, but present in the fire, or the
god of fire. Thus we read, RV. III, 26, 6. agné*h* bhâ´mam marútâm
ó*g*a*h*, 'The splendour of Agni, the strength of the Maruts,' i. e. the
lightning. It must be admitted, however, that a conjecture, proposed by
Bollensen (Z. D. M. G. XLI, p. 501), would improve the verse. He
proposes to read *ri*sh*t*aya*h* instead of v*ri*sh*t*aya*h*. We should
then have to translate, 'Their spears shone like lightnings from the
clouds.' These *ri*sh*t*is or spears are mentioned by the side of khâdi
and rukma in RV. V, 54, 11, and the compound *ri*sh*t*ívidyuta*h* is
applied to the Maruts in I, 168, 5 and V, 52, 13. The difficulty which
remains is abhríyâ*h*.

Note <span id="an_2:34:2:2">2</span>. On dyâ´vo ná st*ri*bhi*h*, see
note to I, 87, 1.

Note <span id="an_2:34:2:3">3</span>. The second line is full of
difficulties. No doubt the Maruts are represented as the sons of Rudra
(V, 60, 5; VI, 66, 3), and as the sons of P*ris*ni, fem., being called
P*rís*ni-mâtara*h*. Their birth is sometimes spoken of as unknown (VII,
56, 2), but hardly as mysterious. Who knows their birth, hardly means
more than 'the wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh.' P*ris*ni as a feminine is
the speckled sky, and the cloud may have been conceived

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

as the udder at the same time that P*ris*ni was conceived as a cow (I,
160, 3). Nothing seems therefore more natural than that we should
translate, 'When Rudra had begotten you in the bright lap of P*ris*ni.'
The bright lap, *s*ukrám û´dha*h*, is an idiomatic expression (VI, 66,
1; IV, 3, 10), and I see no reason why we should with Roth, K. Z. XXVI,
49, change the *s*ukré of the padapâ*th*a into *s*ukrá*h* and refer it
to v*rí*shâ.

The real difficulty lies in á*g*ani. Can it mean he begot, as Bergaigne
(Religion Védique, III, 35) interprets it? Wherever á*g*ani occurs it
means he was born, and I doubt whether it can mean anything else. It is
easy to suggest a*g*anît, for though the third person of the aorist
never occurs in the RV., the other persons, such as a*g*anish*t*a,
*g*anish*th*â*h*, are there. But, as the verse now stands, we must
translate, 'When Rudra was born for you, he the strong one in the bright
udder of P*ris*ni.' Could Rudra be here conceived as the son, he who in
other passages is represented as the husband of P*ris*ni? There is
another passage which may yield the same sense, VI, 66, 3. vidé hí mâtâ´
mahá*h* mahî´ sâ´, sâ´ ít p*rís*ni*h* subhvẽ gárbham â´ adhât, 'for she,
the great, is known as the mother of the great, that very P*ris*ni
conceived the germ (the Maruts) for the strong one.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_2:34:3:1">1</span>. Ukshánte is explained by washing,
cleaning the horses, before they start for a new race. See V, 59, I.
ukshánte á*s*vân, followed by tárushante â´ rá*g*a*h*; IX, 109, 10.
á*s*va*h* ná niktá*h* vâ*g*î´ dhánâya; *S*atap. Br. XI, 5, 5, 13.
Pischel (Ved. Stud. I, 189) supposes that it always refers to the
washing after a race.

Note <span id="an_2:34:3:2">2</span>. Nadásya kár*n*ai*h* is very
difficult. Sâya*n*a's explanation, meghasya madhyaprade*s*ai*h*,
'through the hollows of the cloud,' presupposes that nada by itself can
in the RV. be used in the sense of cloud, and that kar*n*a, ear, may
have the meaning of a hole or a passage. To take, as BR. propose,
kár*n*a in the sense of kar*n*á, eared, with long ears, would not help
us much. Grassmann's

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

translation, 'mit der Wolke schnellen Fittigen,' is based on a
conjectural reading, nadasya par*n*ai*h*. Ludwig's translation, 'mit des
fluszes wellen den raschen eilen sie,' is ingenious, but too bold, for
kar*n*a never means waves, nor nada river in the Rig-veda. The
Vedârthayatna gives: 'they rush with steeds that make the roar,' taking
kar*n*ai*h* for kart*ri*bhi*h*, which again is simply impossible. The
best explanation is that suggested by Pischel, Ved. Stud., p. 189. He
takes nada for reed, and points out that whips were made of reeds. The
kar*n*a would be the sharp point of the reed, most useful for a whip. I
cannot, however, follow him in taking â*s*úbhi*h* in the sense of
accelerating. I think it refers to a*s*va in the preceding pâda.

Note <span id="an_2:34:3:3">3</span>. Híra*n*ya*s*iprâ*h*. *S*iprâ, in
the dual *s*ipre, is intended for the jaws, the upper and lower jaws, as
in RV. I, 101, 10. ví syasva *s*ípre, open the jaws. See Zimmer,
Altindisches Leben, p. 249, note. RV. III, 32, I; V, 36, 2, *s*ipre and
hánû; VIII, 76, 10); X, 96, 9. *s*ípre hári*n*î dávidhvata*h*; X, 105,
5. *s*íprâbhyâm *s*iprí*n*îvân. In the plural, however, *s*iprâ*h*, V,
54, 11 (*s*íprâ*h* *s*îrshásu vítatâ*h* hira*n*yáyî*h*), VIII, 7, 25, is
intended for something worn on the head, made of gold or gold threads.
As we speak of the ears of a cap, that is, lappets which protect the
ears, or of the cheeks of a machine, so in this case the jaws seem to
have been intended for what protects the jaws, and not necessarily for
the real jaw-bones of an animal; used as an helmet, and afterwards
imitated in any kind of metal. As to *s*iprin it may mean helmeted or
possessed of jaws. To be possessed of jaws is no peculiar distinction,
yet in several of the passages where *s*iprin occurs, there is a clear
reference to eating and drinking; see VI, 44, 14; VIII, 2, 28; 17, 4;
32, 24; 33, 7; 92, 4; see also *s*ípravân in VI, 17, 2. It is possible
therefore that like su*s*ipra, *s*iprin also was used in the sense of
possessed of jaw-bones, i. e. of strong jaw-bones. Even such epithets as
híra*n*ya-*s*ipra, hári-*s*ipra, híri-*s*ipra may mean possessed of
golden, possibly of strong jaws. (M. M., Biographies of Words, p. 263,
note.) Roth takes hári*s*ipra as yellow-jawed, híri*s*ipra as
golden-cheeked, or with golden helmet, hira*n*ya*s*ipra, with golden

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

helmet. A decision between golden-jawed or golden-helmeted is difficult,
yet golden-jawed is applicable in all cases.

In our passage we must be guided by dávidhvata*h*, which together with
*s*ípra occurs again X, 96, 9. *s*ípre vâ´*g*âya hári*n*i dávidhvata*h*,
shaking the golden jaws, and it seems best to translate: O ye
golden-jawed Maruts, shaking (your jaws), you go to feed.

Note <span id="an_2:34:3:4">4</span>. If we retain the accent in
p*ri*kshám, we shall have to take it as an adverb, from p*ri*kshá,
quick, vigorous, like the German snël. This view is supported by
Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, 96. If, however, we could change the accent into
p*rí*ksham, we might defend Sâya*n*a's interpretation. We should have to
take p*rí*ksham as the accusative of p*ri*ksh, corresponding to the
dative p*ri*kshé in the next verse. P*ri*ksh is used together with
*s*ubh, ish, ûr*g* (VI, 62, 4), and as we have *s*ubham yâ, we might
take p*rí*ksham yâ in the sense of going for food, in search of food.
But it is better to take p*ri*kshám as an adverb. In the next verse
p*ri*kshé is really a kind of infinitive, governing bhûvanâ.

Note <span id="an_2:34:3:5">5</span>. Tradition explains the P*ri*shatîs
as spotted deer, but p*ri*shada*s*va, as an epithet of the Maruts, need
not mean having P*ri*shatîs for their horses, but having spotted horses.
See Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, p. 378, note.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_2:34:4:1">1</span>. Ludwig translates: Zu narung haben
sie alle dise wesen gebracht; Grassmann: Zur Labung netzten alle diese
Wesen sie. Ludwig suggests *k*itrâya for mitrâya; Oldenberg, far better,
mitrâyáva*h*, looking for friends, like mitrâyúva*h*, in I, 173, 10.

Note <span id="an_2:34:4:2">2</span>. On vayúna, see Pischel in Vedische
Studien, p. 301. But why does Pischel translate *rig*ipyá by bulls,
referring to VI, 67, 11?

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:34:5:1">1</span>. Adhvasmábhi*h* seems to mean
unimpeded or smooth. Cf. IX, 91, 3.

Note <span id="an_2:34:5:2">2</span>. The meaning of índhanvabhi*h* is
very doubtful.

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_2:34:6:1">1</span>. Narâ´*m* ná sá*m*sa*h*, the
original form of Narâ*s*a*m*sa*h*, I take here as a proper name,
Männerlob (like Frauenlob, the poet) referring to Indra. Bergaigne, I,
p. 305, doubts whether Narâ*s*a*m*sa can be a proper name in our
passage, but on p. 308 he calls it an appellation of Indra.

Note <span id="an_2:34:6:2">2</span>. Á*s*vâm iva, gives a sense, but
one quite inappropriate to the Veda. It would mean, 'fill the cow in her
udder like a mare.' I therefore propose to read asvãm iva (asuam iva),
from asû, a cow that is barren, or a cow that has not yet calved. Thus
we read, I, 112, 3. yâ´bhi*h* dhenúm asvãm pínvatha*h*, 'with the same
help with which you nourish a barren cow.' Cf. I, 116, 22. staryãm
pipyathu*h* gâ´m, 'you have filled the barren cow.' If asvãm iva dhenúm
is a simile, we want an object to which it refers, and this we find in
dhíyam. Thus we read, V, 71, 2; VII, 94, 2; IX, 19, 2, pipyatam
dhíya*h*, to fulfil prayers. I know, of course, that such changes in the
sacred text will for the present seem most objectionable to my friends
in India, but I doubt not that the time will come when they will see
that such emendations are inevitable. I see that in the appendix to the
Petersburg Dictionary, s. v. asû, the same conjecture has been
suggested.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_2:34:7:1">1</span>. Here again I have taken great
liberties. Âpânám is explained by Sâya*n*a as a participle for
âpnuvantam. This participle, though quite correct (see Lindner,
Altindische Nominalbildung, p. 54), does not occur again in the RV., nor
does it yield a proper meaning. It could only mean, 'give us a horse to
the chariot, an obtaining prayer, rousing the attention (of the gods)
day by day.' Âpâna may mean a drinking or carousing, and I do not see
why we should not take it in that sense. Sacrifices in ancient times'
were often festivals; VII, 22, 3. imâ´ bráhma sadhamâ´de *g*ushasva,
'accept these prayers at our feast.' If we suppose that âpâna refers to
the drinking of Soma, then

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

nothing is more appropriate than to call the drinking *k*itáyat,
exciting, bráhma, a hymn. Anyhow I can discover no better meaning in
this line. Grassmann, who knows that *k*itayati means to excite, yet
translates: 'Gebt Gebet, das durchdringt, euch erinnernd Tag für Tag.'
Ludwig: 'Das erfolgreiche brahma, das erinnernde tag für tag.' Possibly
we should have to change the accent from âpâná to âpâ´na. Âpâná in IX,
10, 5 is equally obscure.

Note <span id="an_2:34:7:2">2</span>. On v*rig*ana, see I, 165,
15<sup>3</sup>. For fuller discussions of the various meanings of
v*rig*ana, see Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, 139; Oldenberg, Göttinger gel.
Anzeigen, 1890, pp. 410 seq.; Ph. Colinet, Les principes de l’exégèse
védique d’après MM. Pischel et Geldner, p. 28; Ludwig, Über Methode bei
Interpretation des Rig-veda, 1890, pp. 27 seq.

Note <span id="an_2:34:7:3">3</span>. Saní means acquiring, success,
luck, gain, and is often placed in juxtaposition with medhâ´, wisdom. If
they are thus placed side by side, sank looks almost like an adjective,
meaning efficient. RV. I, 18, 6. saním medhâ´m ayâsisham, 'I had asked
for efficient, true, real wisdom,' or, 'I had asked for success and
wisdom.' In such passages, however, as V, 27, 4. dádat *rik*â´ saním
yaté dádat medhâ´m *ri*tâyaté, it is clear that saní was considered as
independent and different from medhâ´ (*rik*âyaté = *ri*tâyaté).

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_2:34:8:1">1</span>. On sudâ´nava*h*, see note to I,
64, 6. It must often be left open whether sudâ´nu was understood as
bounteous, or as having good rain or good Soma.

Note <span id="an_2:34:8:2">2</span>. Pinvate, lit. to make swell or
abound.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_2:34:9:1">1</span>. V*ri*katâ´ti is an old locative of
v*ri*katât, wolf-hood. To place us in wolf hood means to treat us as
wolves, or as vogelfrei. Others take it to mean treating us as a wolf
would treat us.

Note <span id="an_2:34:9:2">2</span>. Tápushâ *k*akríyâ. According to
Lanman (p. 571) tápushâ might be taken as an acc. dual fem. I know,

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

however, of no strictly analogous cases, and prefer to take tápushâ as
an instrumental, this being its usual employment.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_2:34:10:1">1</span>. The second line is obscure.
Neither Grassmann nor Ludwig nor Sâya*n*a can extract any intelligible
meaning from it. I have translated it, but I am far from satisfied.
There may be an antithesis between the friends (the Maruts themselves,
see V, 53, 2), milking the udder of P*ris*ni, and the Maruts coming to
blame their friends for not offering them sacrifices, or for offering
them sacrifices in common with Indra. In the first case when they, as
friends, milk the cloud, their approach is brilliant and auspicious. In
the second case, when they come to blame those who ought to celebrate
them, or those who are actually hostile to them by causing the ruin or
decay of a friend of the Maruts, such as Trita, their approach is
likewise brilliant, but not auspicious. Trita is a friend of the Maruts
whom they assist in battle, and it is possible that this legend may be
alluded to here. Sometimes Trita seems also connected with the third
libation which was offered at sunset, just as Vish*n*u represented the
second libation which was offered at noon <span
id="fr_125"></span>[a](#fn_116.md). Thus we read, VIII, 12, 16. yát sómam
indra vísh*n*avi yát vâ gha trité âptyé yát vâ marútsu mándase, 'whether
you, Indra, enjoy the Soma near Vish*n*u, or near Trita Âptya, or among
the Maruts.' *S*âkapû*n*i, as quoted by Yâska (Nir. XII, 19), explains
the three steps of Vish*n*u as earth, sky, and heaven; Aur*n*avâbha
distinguishes Samâroha*n*a, Vish*n*upada, and Gaya*s*iras. But all this
does not help us to disentangle our verse. It should be added that
Bergaigne makes Tritám to be governed by duhû*h* (Rel. Véd. II, 327). We
should then have to translate, 'or whether they milk Trita in order to
blame the singer, to make them old who make

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

others old, or who themselves become old.' This, however, does not help
us much. Professor Oldenberg conjectures that possibly *g*uratâ´m might
be changed to *g*urátâ´m, and that the dual of the verb might refer to
Rudra and P*ris*ni; or we might read *g*urátâ for *g*uráta, if it refers
to Rudriyas. Návamânasya might also be used in the sense of making a
noise (see I, 29, 5), and possibly návamânasya nidé might have been
intended for shouting and laughing to scorn. But all this leaves the
true meaning of the verse as unfathomable as ever.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_2:34:11:1">1</span>. Vísh*n*or eshásya prabh*ri*thé is
obscure. At the offering of the rapid Vish*n*u is supposed to mean, when
the rapid Vish*n*u offers Soma. The same phrase occurs again, VII, 40,
5. In VIII, 20, 3, we can translate, 'we know the strength of the
Maruts, and of the hasting Vish*n*u, the bounteous gods.' In VII, 39, 5,
the reading is vísh*n*um eshâm. Bergaigne (II, 419) is inclined to take
vish*n*u esha as Soma. We should then translate, 'at the offering of
Soma.'

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_2:34:12:1">1</span>. The Da*s*agvas are mentioned as
an old priestly family, like the Aṅgiras, and they seem also, like the
Aṅgiras, to have their prototypes or their ancestors among the divine
hosts. Could they here be identified with the Maruts? They are said to
have been the first to carry on the sacrifice, and they are asked to
rouse men at the break of the day. Now the same may be said of the
Maruts. They are often connected with the dawn, probably because the
storms break forth with greater vigour in the morning, or, it may be,
because the chasing away of the darkness of the night recalls the
struggle between the darkness of the thunderstorm and the brightness of
the sun. The matutinal character of the Maruts appears, for instance, in
V, 53, 14 (usrí bhesha*g*ám), and their father Dyaus is likewise called
v*ri*shabhá*h* usríya*h*, V, 58, 6. In the second line ûr*n*ute, though
in the singular, refers also to the Maruts in the plural; see Bergaigne,
Mélanges Renier,

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Paris, 1886, p.
80. There still remain two difficult words, maná*h* and gó-ar*n*asâ. The
former (see Lanman, p. 501) may be taken as an adjective referring to
the Da*s*agvas or Maruts, unless we take it as an adverb, quickly, like
makshu. If we could change it into mahâ´, it would form an appropriate
adjective to *g*yotishâ, as in IV, 50, 4. On gó-ar*n*asâ all that can be
said is that it mostly occurs where something is uncovered or revealed,
so I, 112, 18; X, 38, 2.

Note <span id="an_2:34:12:2">2</span>. On ya*gñ*am vah, to carry on the
sacrifice like a wagon, see Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 259-260. See also
RV. VIII, 26, 15; 58, 1, and ya*gñ*a-vâhas.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_2:34:13:1">1</span>. In interpreting this obscure
verse we must begin with what is clear. The aru*n*â´*h* a*ñg*áya*h* are
the well-known ornaments of the Maruts, mentioned I, 37, 2, note; I, 64,
4, note, &c. The Maruts shine in these ornaments or paints, I, 85, 3;
87, 1; V, 56, 1; X, 78, 7. Though we do not know their special
character, we know that, like the daggers, spears, and bracelets of the
Maruts, they were supposed to contribute to their beautiful appearance.
Again, we know that when the Maruts are said to grow (vav*ri*dhu*h*),
that means that they grow in strength, in spirits, and in splendour, or,
in a physical sense, that the storms increase, that the thunder roars,
and the lightnings flash, see V, 55, 3; 59, 5. Now if it is said that
the Rudras grew with ksho*n*îs, as if with bright red ornaments, we must
have in these ksho*n*îs the physical prototype of what are
metaphorically called their glittering ornaments. And here we can only
think either of the bright morning clouds (referring to ushâ´*h* ná
râmî´*h* aru*n*aí*h* ápa ûr*n*ute in the preceding verse), or
lightnings. These bright clouds of heaven are sometimes conceived as the
mothers (III, 9, 2. apá*h* mât*rî´h*), and more especially the mothers
of the Maruts, who are in consequence called Síndhu-mâtara*h*, X, 78, 6,
a name elsewhere given to Soma, IX, 61, 7, and to the A*s*vins, I, 46,
2. It is said of a well-known hero, Purûravas (originally a solar hero),
that as soon as he was born the women (gnâ*h*) were there, and
immediately afterwards

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

that the rivers increased or cherished him, X, 95, 7. In other passages
too these celestial rivers or waters or clouds are represented as women,
whether mothers or wives (X, 124, 7). A number of names are given to
these beings, when introduced as the companions of the Apsaras Urva*s*î,
and it is said of them that they carne along like a*ñg*áya*h*
aru*n*áya*h*, like bright red ornaments, X, 95, 6. It seems clear
therefore that the aru*n*â´*h* a*ñg*áya*h* of the Maruts have to be
explained by the bright red clouds of the morning, or in more
mythological language, by the Apsaras, who are said to be like
aru*n*áya*h* a*ñg*áya*h*. Hence, whatever its etymology may have been,
ksho*n*î´bhi*h* in our passage must refer to the clouds of heaven, and
the verse can only be translated, 'the Rudras grew with the clouds as
with their red ornaments,' that is, the clouds were their red ornaments,
and as the clouds grew in splendour, the Maruts grew with their splendid
ornaments.

Professor Geldner arrived at a similar conclusion. In Bezzenberger's
Beiträge, XI, p. 327, and more recently in Ved. Stud., p. 277, he
assigned to ksho*n*î the meaning of woman, which is quite possible, and
would make it a synonym of the celestial gnâs. But he translates, 'the
Maruts excite themselves with red colours as with women.' These are
hardly Vedic thoughts, and the position of ná would remain anomalous.
Nor should we gain much if we read to ksho*n*aya*h* aru*n*ebhi*h* na
a*ñg*ibhi*h*, 'these Rudras were delighted like wives by bright
ornaments.' The bright ornaments have once for all a settled meaning,
they are peculiar to the Maruts, and cannot in a Marut hymn be taken in
any other sense.

Then comes the question, how is the meaning assigned to ksho*n*î, namely
cloud, or, as personified, Apsaras, applicable to other passages? In X,
95, 9, it seems most appropriate: 'So long as the mortal (Purûravas),
longing for the immortal (Apsaras), does not come near with strength to
those ksho*n*îs, i. e. those Apsaras, or morning clouds, they beautified
their bodies like ducks' (an excellent image, if one watches ducks
cleaning themselves in the water), 'like sporting horses biting each
other.' Geldner

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

translates this verse somewhat differently, Ved. Stud. I, p. 276.

Having disposed of these two passages where ksho*n*î occurs in the
plural, we have next to consider those where it stands in the dual. Here
ksho*n*î always means heaven and earth, like rodasî, dyâvâp*ri*thivî,
&c.

VIII, 7, 22. sám u tyé mahatî´*h* apá*h* sám ksho*n*î´ sám u sû´ryam …
parva*s*á*h* dadhu*h*. They, the Maruts, set the great waters (the sky),
heaven and earth and the sun piecemeal (or, they put them together piece
by piece).

VIII, 52, 10. sám índra*h* râ´ya*h* b*ri*hatî´*h* adhûnuta sám ksho*n*î´
sám u sû´ryam. Indra shook the great treasures, heaven and earth, and
the sun.

VIII, 99, 6. ánu te *s*úshmam turáyantam îyatu*h* ksho*n*î´ *s*í*s*um ná
mâtárâ. Heaven and earth followed thy rapid strength, like mother-cows
their calf.

II, 16, 3. ná ksho*n*î´bhyâm paribhvẽ te indriyám. Thy strength is not
to be compassed by heaven and earth.

If after this we look at the passage translated by Professor Geldner, I,
180, 5. apá*h* ksho*n*î´ sa*k*ate mâ´hinâ vâm, we see at once that
apá*h* and ksho*n*î´ cannot be separated, and that we must translate,
your Mâhinâ reaches heaven and earth and the sky. Mâhinâ, according to
Professor Geldner, means the magnificent woman, namely Sûryâ, but it is
possible that it may have been meant for 'mahimâ, your greatness reaches
heaven and earth and the sky.' Apá*h*, which Professor Geldner
translates 'from the water,' is the acc. plural, meaning the waters
between heaven and earth, or the sky. It occurs again in connection with
heaven and earth, the sun, heaven, and generally without any copula.
Thus, VIII, 7, 22. apá*h*, ksho*n*î´, sû´ryam, i. e. the waters (the
sky), heaven and earth, the sun. I, 36, 8. ródasî apá*h*, heaven and
earth and the waters; cf. V, 31, 6. Likewise I, 52, 12. apá*h* svã*h*
paribhû´*h* eshi â´ dívam; V, 14, 4. ávindat gâ´*h* apá*h* svã*h*; VI,
47, 14. apá*h* gâ´*h*; cf. VI, 60, 2. VII, 44, 1. dyâ´vâp*ri*thivî´
apá*h* svã*h*, cf. X, 36, 1; IX. 90, 4; 91, 6.

There remain five passages where ksho*n*î*h* occurs, and where Professor
Geldner's conjecture that it means women

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

holds good. In I, 54, 1, it may mean real women, or the women of the
clouds. In I, 57, 4; 173, 7; VIII, 3, 10; 13, 17; also in X, 22, 9,
women seems the most plausible translation.

Note <span id="an_2:34:13:2">2</span>. *R*ítasya sádanâni is almost
impossible to translate. It may be the places in heaven where the Maruts
are supposed to be, or the places where sacrifices are offered to them.

Note <span id="an_2:34:13:3">3</span>. Átyena pâ´*g*asâ has been
explained in different ways. Sâya*n*a renders it by always moving power;
Grassmann by 'mit schnell erregtem Schimmer;' Ludwig, 'mit eilender
kraft,' though he is no longer satisfied with this meaning, and suggests
'net for catching.' Roth has touched several times on this word. In the
Allgemeine Monatsschrift of 1851, p. 87, he suggested for pâ´*g*as the
meaning of 'impression of a foot or of a carriage, perhaps also
reflection.' In his Notes on the Nirukta, p. 78 seq., he is very hard on
the Indian commentators who explain the word by strength, but who never
go conscientiously through all the passages in which a word occurs. He
then still maintained that the word ought to be translated by track.

It seems, however, that the most appropriate meaning in the passages in
which pâ´*g*as occurs is splendour, though of course a stream of light
may be conceived as a bright train or path. In some the meaning of light
seems quite inevitable, for instance, III, 15, I. ví pâ´*g*asâ
p*ri*thúnâ *s*ó*s*ukâna*h*. Agni, shining with broad light.

VIII, 46, 25. â´ … yâhí makhâ´ya pâ´*g*ase. Come hither, Vâyu, for
strong light.

III, 14, 1. (agní*h*) p*ri*thivyâ´m pâ´*g*a*h* a*s*ret. Agni assumed (or
spread) splendour on earth.

VII, 10, 1. ushá*h* ná *g*ârá*h* p*ri*thú pâ´*g*a*h* a*s*ret. (Agni,)
like the lover of the dawn, assumed (or spread) wide splendour.

III, 61, 5. ûrdhvám madhudhâ´ diví pâ´*g*a*h* a*s*ret. The dawn assumed
rising splendour in the sky.

VII, 3, 4. ví yásya te p*ri*thivyâ´m pâ´*g*a*h* á*s*ret. Thou (Agni)
whose splendour spread on earth.

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

IX, 68, 3. abhivrá*g*an ákshitam pâ´*g*a*h* â´ dade. (Soma) approaching
assumed imperishable splendour. This splendour of Soma is also mentioned
in IX, 109, 21, and the expression that he shakes his splendour
(v*rí*thâ kar) occurs IX, 76, 1; 88, 5. (Cf. Geldner, Ved. Stud. I, p.
117.)

In VI, 21, 7. abhí tvâ pâ´*g*a*h* rakshása*h* ví tasthe, it would, no
doubt, seem preferable to translate, 'the power of the Rakshas came upon
thee,' but the ugrám pâ´*g*a*h*, the fierce light, is not out of place
either, while in most of the passages which we have examined, the
meaning of power would be entirely out of place.

In I, 121, 11, heaven and earth seem to be called pâ´*g*asî, the two
splendours. Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 87, translates átyena pâ´*g*asâ by
'durch das stattliche Ross,' namely the Soma, but pâ´*g*as seems to be
something that belongs to Soma, not Soma himself.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_2:34:14:1">1</span>. Grassmann suggests iyânâ´*h*
instead of iyâná*h*.

Note <span id="an_2:34:14:2">2</span>. Abhísh*t*aye, for superiority or
victory, rather than for assistance. Abhish*t*í, with accent on the last
syllable, means conqueror or victorious; see RV. I, 9, 1; III, 34, 4; X,
100, 12; 104, 10.

##### Verse 15.
