### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 86.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 6, VARGA 11-12.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. O Maruts, that man in whose dwelling you drink (the Soma), ye mighty
(sons) of heaven, he indeed has the best guardians
[1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:1:1.md).

2\. You who are propitiated [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:2:1.md) either by
sacrifices or from the prayers of the sage, hear the call, O Maruts!

3\. Aye, the powerful man to whom you have granted a sage, he will live
in a stable rich in cattle [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:3:1.md).

4\. On the altar of this strong man (here) [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:4:1.md)
Soma is poured out in daily sacrifices; praise and joy are sung.

5\. To him let the mighty [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:5:1.md) Maruts listen, to
him who surpasses all men, as the flowing rain-clouds
[2](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:5:2.md) pass over the sun.

6\. For we, O Maruts, have sacrificed at many harvests, through the
mercies [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:6:1) of the swift gods (the storm-gods.md).

7\. May that mortal be blessed, O chasing Maruts, whose offerings you
carry off [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:7:1.md).

8\. You take notice either of the sweat of him who praises you, ye men
of true strength, or of the desire of the suppliant
[1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:8:1.md).

9\. O ye of true strength, make this manifest with might! strike the
fiend [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:9:1.md) with your lightning!

10\. Hide the hideous darkness, destroy [1](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:10:1.md)
every tusky [2](sbe3223.htm#an_1:86:10:2.md) fiend. Make the light which we
long for!

#### NOTES.

This hymn is ascribed to Gotama.

Verse 1 =VS. VIII, 31; AV. XX, 1, 2; TS. IV, 2, 11, 1.

Verse 2=TS. IV, 2, 11, 2.

Verse 6=TS. IV, 3, 13, 5.

Verse 8= SV. II, 944.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:86:1:1">1</span>. Vímahas occurs only once more as
an epithet of the Maruts, V, 87, 4. Being an adjective derived from
máhas, strength, it means very strong. The strong ones of heaven is an
expression analogous to I, 64, 2. divá*h* *ri*shvâ´sa*h* ukshá*n*a*h*;
I, 64, 4. divá*h* nára*h*. The Ait. Brâhma*n*a VI, 10, takes gopâ,
guardian, as Indra.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:86:2:1">1</span>. The construction of this verse is
not clear. Ya*gñ*á-vâhas has two meanings in the Veda. It is applied to
the priest who carries or performs the sacrifice:

III, 8, 3, and 24, 1. vár*k*a*h* dhâ*h* ya*gñ*á-vâhase.

Grant splendour to the sacrificer!

But it is also used of the gods who carry off the sacrifice, and in that
case it means hardly more than worshipped or propitiated; I, 15, 11
(A*s*vinau); IV, 47, 4 (Indra and Vâyu); VIII, 12, 20 (Indra). In our
verse it is used in the latter sense, and it is properly construed with
the instrumental ya*gñ*aí*h*. The difficulty is the gen. plur. matînâ´m,
instead of matíbhi*h*. The sense, however, seems to allow of but one
construction, and we may suppose that the genitive depends on the
ya*gñ*a in ya*gñ*ávâhas, 'accepting the worship of the prayers of the
priest.' Benfey refers ya*gñ*aí*h* to the preceding verse, and joins
hávam to víprasya matînâ´m: 'Durch Opfer—Opferfördrer ihr!—oder ihr
hört—Maruts—den Ruf der Lieder, die der Priester schuf.'

The Sa*m*hitâ text lengthens the last syllable of *s*ri*n*utá, as
suggested by the metre.

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

If the accent allowed ya*gñ*avâhasa*h* to be taken as a genitive, the
translation, as suggested by Ludwig, might be, Either for the sake of
the sacrifices of the sacrificer, or because of the prayers of the sage,
O Maruts, hear the call.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:86:3:1">1</span>. The genitive yásya vâ*g*ína*h*
depends on vípra. Anu-taksh, like anu-grah, anu-*gñ*â, seems to convey
the meaning of doing in behalf or for the benefit of a person. Gántâ
might also be translated in a hostile sense, he will go into, he will
conquer many a stable full of cows.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:86:4:1">1</span>. Ludwig has pointed out that asyá
may refer to the present sacrificer.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:86:5:1">1</span>. I have altered â´ bhúva*h* into
âbhúva*h*, for I do not think that bhuva*h*, the second pers. sing.,
even if it were bhúvat, the third pers., could be joined with the
relative pronoun yá*h* in the second pada. The phrase ví*s*vâ*h* yá*h*
*k*arsha*n*î´*h* abhí occurs more than once, and is never preceded by
the verb bhuva*h* or bhuvat. Âbhúva*h*, on the contrary, is applied to
the Maruts, I, 64, 6, vidátheshu âbhúva*h*; and as there can be no doubt
who are the deities invoked, âbhúva*h*, the strong ones, is as
appropriate an epithet as vímahas in the first verse.

Note <span id="an_1:86:5:2">2</span>. Sasrúshî*h* ísha*h*, as connected
with sûra, the sun, can only be meant for the flowing waters, the
rain-clouds, the givers of ish or vigour. They are called divyâ´*h*
ísha*h*:

VIII, 5, 21. utá na*h* divyâ´*h* ísha*h* utá síndhûn varshatha*h*.

You rain down on us the heavenly waters and the rivers.

<span class="smallcaps">Wilson</span> translates: May the Maruts,
victorious over all men, hear (the praises) of this (their worshipper);
and may (abundant) food be obtained by him who praises them.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Ihn, der ob allen Menschen ragt,
sollen hören die Labungen, and nahn, die irgend Weisen nahn.

<span class="smallcaps">Ludwig</span>: Hören sollen von ihm, der über
allen menschen ist, die erden, seine bis zur sonne gelangten kräfte. In
his

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

notes he would prefer: Von ihm sollen sie gegenwartig hören, von ihm der
alle menschen übertrift (und die in die sonne wegegangenen), die
darbringungen.

*S*roshantu does not occur again; but we find *s*róshan, I, 68, 5;
*s*róshamâ*n*a, III, 8, 10; VII, 51, 1; VII, 7, 6.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:86:6:1">1</span>. The expression ávobhi*h*, with the
help, the blessings, the mercies, is generally used with reference to
divine assistance; (I, 117, 19; 167, 2; 185, 10; 11; IV, 22, 7; 41, 6;
V, 74, 6; VI, 47, 12; VII, 20, 1; 35, 1, &c.) It seems best therefore to
take *k*arsha*n*í as a name or epithet of the Maruts, although, after
the invocation of the Maruts by name, this repetition is somewhat
unusual. I should have preferred, 'with the help of our men, of our
active and busy companions,' for *k*arsha*n*í is used in that sense
also. Only ávobhi*h* would not be in its right place then. The same
applies to the various reading in TS. IV, 3, 13, 5, where instead of
ávobhi*h* we find máhobhi*h*. This too is used with reference to gods,
and particularly to the Maruts; see I, 165, 5, note.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:86:7:1">1</span>. Par, with ati, means to carry over
(I, 97, 8; 99, I; 174, 9; III, 15, 3; 20, 4; IV, 39, I; V, 25, 9; 73, 8;
VII, 40, 4; 97, 4; VIII, 26, 5; 67, 2, &c.); with apa, to remove (I,
129, 5); with ni*h*, to throw down. Hence, if used by itself, unless it
means to overrun, as frequently, it can only have the general sense of
carrying, taking, accepting, or accomplishing.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:86:8:1">1</span>. Vidá as second pers. plur. perf.
is frequent, generally with the final 'a' long in the Sa*m*hitâ, I, 156,
3; V, 41, 13; 55, 2.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:86:9:1">1</span>. Observe the long penultimate in
ráksha*h*, instead of the usual short syllable. Cf. I, 12, 5, and see
Kuhn, Beiträge, vol. iii, p. 456.

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:86:10:1">1</span>. See note 1 to I, 39, 3.

Note <span id="an_1:86:10:2">2</span>. Atrín, which stands for attrín,
is one of the many names assigned to the powers of darkness and
mischief. It is derived from atrá, which means tooth or jaw, and
therefore meant originally an ogre with large teeth or jaws, a devourer.
Besides atrá, we also find in the Veda átra, with the accent on the
first syllable, and meaning what serves for eating, or food:

X, 79, 2. átrâ*n*i asmai pa*t*-bhí*h* sám bharanti.

They bring together food for him (Agni) with their feet.

With the accent on the last syllable, atrá in one passage means an eater
or an ogre, like atrín:

V, 32, 8. apâ´dam atrám—m*ri*dhrá-vâ*k*am.

Indra killed the footless ogre, the babbler.

It means tooth or jaw:

I, 129, 8. svayám sâ´ rishayádhyai yâ´ na*h* upa-îshé atraí*h*.

May she herself go to destruction who attacks us with her teeth.

It is probably from atrá in the sense of tooth (cf. ὀδόντες = ἐδόντες)
that atrín is derived, meaning ogre or a devouring devil. In the later
Sanskrit, too, the Asuras are represented as having large tusks, Mahâbh.
V, 3572, damsh*t*ri*n*o bhîmavegâ*s* *k*a.

Thus we read I, 21, 5, that Indra and Agni destroy the Rakshas, and the
poet continues:

ápra*g*â*h* santu atrí*n*a*h*.

May the ogres be without offspring!

IX, 86, 48. *g*ahí ví*s*vân rakshása*h* indo (íti) atrí*n*a*h*.

Kill, O Soma, all the tusky Rakshas. Cf. IX, 104, 6; 105, 6.

VI, 51, 14. *g*ahí ní atrí*n*am pa*n*ím.

Kill, O Soma, the tusky Pa*n*i.

I, 94, 9. vadhaí*h* du*h*-*s*á*m*sân ápa du*h*-dhyã*h* *g*ahi  
         dûré vâ yé ánti vâ ké *k*it atrí*n*a*h*.

Strike with thy blows, O Agni, the evil-spoken, evil-minded (spirits),
the ogres, those who are far or who are near.

See also I, 36, 14; 20; VI, 16, 28; VII, 104, 1; 5; VIII, 12, 1; 19, 15;
X, 36, 4; 118, 1.
