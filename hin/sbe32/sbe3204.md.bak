*Vedic Hymns, Part I (SBE32)*, by Max Müller, \[1891\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With regard to the interpretation of certain words and sentences too, it
may happen that explanations which have taxed the ingenuity of some
scholars to the utmost, seem to others so self-evident that they would
hardly think of quoting anybody's name in support of them, to say
nothing of the endless and useless work it would entail, were we obliged
always to find out who was the first to propose this or that
interpretation. It is impossible here to lay down general rules:—each
scholar must be guided by his own sense of justice to others and by
self-respect. Let us take one instance. From the first time that I read
the fourth hymn of the Rig-veda, I translated the fifth and sixth
verses:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

utá bruvantu na*h* nída*h* ní*h* anyáta*h* *k*it arata,  
  dádhânâ*h* índre ít dúva*h*,  
utá na*h* su-bhágân arí*h* vo*k*éyu*h* dasma k*ri*sh*t*áya*h*,  
  syâ´ma ít índrasya *s*árma*n*i.

</div>

1\. Whether our enemies say, 'Move away elsewhere, you who offer worship
to Indra only,'—

2\. Or whether, O mighty one, all people call us blessed: may we always
remain in the keeping of Indra.

About the general sense of this passage I imagined there could be no
doubt, although one word in it, viz. arí*h*, required an explanation.
Yet the variety of interpretations proposed by different scholars is
extraordinary. First, if we look to Sâya*n*a, he translates:

1\. May our priests praise Indra! O enemies, go away from this place,
and also from another place! Our priests (may praise Indra), they who
are always performing worship for Indra.

2\. O destroyer of enemies! may the enemy call us possessed of wealth;
how much more, friendly people! May we be in the happiness of Indra!

Professor Wilson did not follow Sâya*n*a closely, but translated:

1\. Let our ministers, earnestly performing his worship,

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

exclaim: Depart, ye revilers, from hence and every other place (where he
is adored).

2\. Destroyer of foes, let our, enemies say we are prosperous: let men
(congratulate us). May we ever abide in the felicity (derived from the
favour) of Indra.

Langlois translated:

1\. Que (ces amis), en fêtant Indra, puissent dire: Vous, qui êtes nos
adversaires, retirez-vous loin d’ici.

2\. Que nos ennemis nous appellent des hommes fortunés, placés que nous
sommes sous la protection d’Indra. Stevenson translated:

1\. Let all men again join in praising Indra. Avaunt ye profane
scoffers, remove from hence, and from every other place, while we
perform the rites of Indra.

2\. O foe-destroyer, (through thy favour) even our enemies speak
peaceably to us, the possessors of wealth; what wonder then if other men
do so. Let us ever enjoy the happiness which springs from Indra's
blessing.

Professor Benfey translated:

1\. And let the scoffers say, They are rejected by every one else,
therefore they celebrate Indra alone.

2\. And may the enemy and the country proclaim us as happy, O destroyer,
if we are only in Indra's keeping <span id="fr_16"></span>[a](#fn_16.md).

Professor Roth, s.v. anyáta*h*, took this word rightly in the sense of
'to a different place,' and must therefore have taken that sentence
'move away elsewhere' in the same sense in which I take it. Later,
however, s.v. ar, he corrected himself, and proposed to translate the
same words by 'you neglect something else.'

Professor Bollensen (Orient und Occident, vol. ii, p. 462),

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

adopting to a certain extent the second rendering of Professor Roth in
preference to that of Professor Benfey, endeavoured to show that the
'something else which is neglected,' is not something indefinite, but
the worship of all the other gods, except Indra.

It might, no doubt, be said that every one of these translations
contains something that is right, though mixed up with a great deal that
is wrong; but to attempt for every verse of the Veda to quote and to
criticise every previous translation, would be an invidious and useless
task. In the case just quoted, it might seem right to state that
Professor Bollensen was the first to see that arí*h* should be joined
with k*ri*sh*t*áya*h*, and that he therefore proposed to alter it to
arî*h*, as a nom. plur. But on referring to Rosen, I find that, to a
certain extent, he had anticipated Professor Bollensen's remark, for
though, in his cautious way, he abstained from altering the text, yet he
remarked: Possitne arí*h* pluralis esse, contracta terminatione, pro
araya*h*?

 

After these preliminary remarks I have to say a few <span
class="margnote">Plan of the work.</span>words on the general plan of my
translation.

I do not attempt as yet a translation of the whole of the Rig-veda, and
I therefore considered myself at liberty to group the hymns according to
the deities to which they are addressed. By this process, I believe, a
great advantage is gained. We see at one glance all that has been said
of a certain god, and we gain a more complete insight into his nature
and character. Something of the same kind had been attempted by the
original collectors of the ten books, for it can hardly be by accident
that each of them begins with hymns addressed to Agni, and that these
are followed by hymns addressed to Indra. The only exception to this
rule is the eighth Ma*nd*ala, for the ninth being devoted to one deity,
to Soma, can hardly be accounted an exception. But if we take the
Rig-veda as a whole, we find hymns, addressed to the same deities, not
only scattered about in different books, but not even grouped together
when they occur in one and the same book. Here, as we lose nothing by
giving up the old arrangement, we

<span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span>

are surely at liberty, for our own purposes, to put together such hymns
as have a common object, and to place before the reader as much material
as possible for an exhaustive study of each individual deity.

I give for each hymn the Sanskrit original <span
id="fr_17"></span>[a](#fn_17.md) in what is known as the Pada text, i. e.
the text in which all words (pada) stand by themselves, as they do in
Greek or Latin, without being joined together according to the rules of
Sandhi. The text in which the words are thus joined, as they are in all
other Sanskrit texts, is called the Sa*m*hitâ text. Whether the Pada or
the Sa*m*hitâ text be the more ancient, may seem difficult to settle. As
far as I can judge, they seem to me, in their present form, the product
of the same period of Vedic scholarship. The Prâti*s*âkhyas, it is true,
start from the Pada text, take it, as it were, for granted, and devote
their rules to the explanation of those changes which that text
undergoes in being changed into the Sa*m*hitâ text. But, on the other
hand, the Pada text in some cases clearly presupposes the Sa*m*hitâ
text. It leaves out passages which are repeated more than once, while
the Sa*m*hitâ text always repeats these passages; it abstains from
dividing the termination of the locative plural su, whenever in the
Sa*m*hitâ text, i. e. according to the rules of Sandhi, it becomes shu;
hence nadîshu, a*g*ishu, but ap-su; and it gives short vowels instead of
the long ones of the Sa*m*hitâ, even in cases where the long vowels are
justified by the rules of the Vedic language. It is certain, in fact,
that neither the Pada nor the Sa*m*hitâ text, as we now possess them,
represents the original text of the Veda. Both show clear traces of
scholastic influences. But if we try to restore the original form of the
Vedic hymns, we shall certainly arrive at some kind of Pada text rather
than at a Sa*m*hitâ text; nay, even in their present form, the original
metre and rhythm of the ancient hymns of the *Ri*shis are far more
perceptible when the words are divided, than when we join them together
throughout according to the rules of Sandhi. Lastly, for practical
purposes, the Pada text is far superior to the Sa*m*hitâ text in which
the final

<span id="page_xliii">p. xliii</span>

and initial letters, that is, the most important letters of words, are
constantly disguised, and liable therefore to different interpretations.
Although in some passages we may differ from the interpretation adopted
by the Pada text, and although certain Vedic words have, no doubt, been
wrongly analysed and divided by *S*âkalya, yet such cases are
comparatively few, and where they occur, they are interesting as
carrying us back to the earliest attempts of Vedic scholarship. In the
vast majority of cases the divided text, with a few such rules as we
have to observe in reading Latin, nay, even in reading Pâli verses,
brings us certainly much nearer to the original utterance of the ancient
*Ri*shis than the amalgamated text.

The critical principles by which I have been guided in editing for the
first time the text of the Rig-veda, require <span
class="margnote">Principles of criticism.</span>a few words of
explanation, as they have lately been challenged on grounds which, I
think, rest on a complete misapprehension of my previous statements on
this subject.

As far as we are able to judge at present, we can hardly speak of
various readings in the Vedic hymns, in the usual sense of that word.
Various readings to be gathered from a collation of different MSS., now
accessible to us, there are none. After collating a considerable number
of MSS., I have succeeded, I believe, in fixing on three representative
MSS., as described in the preface to the first volume of my edition of
the Rig-veda. Even these MSS. are not free from blunders,—for what MS.
is?—but these blunders have no claim to the title of various readings.
They are lapsus calami, and no more; and, what is important, they have
not become traditional <span id="fr_18"></span>[a](#fn_18.md).

<span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span>

The text, as deduced from the best MSS. of the Sa*m*hitâ text, can be
controlled by four independent checks. The first is, of course, a
collation of the best MSS. of the Sa*m*hitâ text.

The second check to be applied to the Sa*m*hitâ text is a comparison
with the Pada text, of which, again, I possessed at least one excellent
MS., and several more modern copies.

The third check was a comparison of this text with Sâya*n*a's
commentary, or rather with the text which is presupposed by that
commentary. In the few cases where the Pada text seemed to differ from
the Sa*m*hitâ text, a note was added to that effect, in the various
readings of my edition; and the same was done, at least in all important
cases, where Sâya*n*a clearly followed a text at variance with our own.

The fourth check was a comparison of any doubtful passage with the
numerous passages quoted in the Prâti*s*âkhya.

These were the principles by which I was guided in the critical
restoration of the text of the Rig-veda, and I believe I may say that
the text as printed by me is more correct than any MS. now accessible,
more trustworthy than the text followed by Sâya*n*a, and in all
important points identically the same with that text which the authors
of the

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Prâti*s*âkhya
followed in their critical researches in the fifth or sixth century
before our era. I believe that starting from that date our text of the
Veda is better authenticated, and supported by a more perfect apparatus
criticus, than the text of any Greek or Latin author, and I do not think
that diplomatic criticism can ever go beyond what has been achieved in
the constitution of the text of the Vedic hymns.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[xl:a](sbe3204.htm#fr_16.md) I add Grassmann's and
Ludwig's renderings:

Grassmann:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Mag spottend sagen unser Feind:  
Kein Andrer kümmert sich um sie;  
Drum feiern Indra sie allein.'  
Und glücklich mögen, Mächtiger!  
Die Freundesstämme nennen uns,  
Nur wenn wir sind in Indra's Schutz.

</div>

Ludwig: Mögen unsere tadler sagen: sogar noch anderes entgeht euch
(dabei), wenn ihr dienst dem Indra tut.

Oder möge uns glückselige nennen der fromme, so nennen, o wundertäter,
die (fünf) völker, in Indra’s schutze mögen wir sein.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[xlii:a](sbe3204.htm#fr_17.md) This is left out in
the second edition.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[xliii:a](sbe3204.htm#fr_18.md) Thus X, 101, 2, one
of the Pada MSS. (P 2) reads distinctly ya*gñ*ám prá k*rin*uta
sakhâya*h*, but all the other MSS. have nayata, and there can be little
doubt that it was the frequent repetition of the verb k*ri* in this
verse which led the writer to substitute k*rin*uta for nayata. No other
MS., as far as I am aware, repeats this blunder. In IX, 86, 34, the
writer of the same MS. puts ra*g*asi instead of dhâvasi, because his eye
was caught by râ*g*â in the preceding line. X, 16, 5, the same MS. reads
sá*m* ga*kkh*asva instead of ga*kkh*atâm, which is supported by S 1, S
2, P 1, while S 3 has a peculiar and more important reading,
ga*kkh*atât. X, 67, 6, the same MS. P 2 has ví *k*akartha instead of ví
*k*akarta.

A number of various readings which have been gleaned from Pandit
Târânâtha's <span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span> Tulâdânâdipaddhati (see
Trübner's American and Oriental Literary Record, July 31, 1868) belong
to the same class. They may be due either to the copyists of the MSS.
which Pandit Târânâtha used while compiling his work, or they may by
accident have crept into his own MS. Anyhow, not one of them is
supported either by the best MSS. accessible in Europe, or by any
passage in the Prâti*s*âkhya.
