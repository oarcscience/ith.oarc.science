### MA*ND*ALA X, HYMN 78.

#### ASH*T*AKA VIII, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 12-13.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. Full of devotion like priests with their prayers, wealthy like pious
men, who please the gods with their offerings, beautiful to behold like
brilliant kings, without a blemish like the youths of our hamlets—

2\. They who are gold-breasted like Agni with his splendour, quick to
help like self-harnessed winds, good leaders like the oldest experts,
they are to the righteous man like Somas, that yield the best
protection.

3\. They who are roaring and hasting like winds, brilliant like the
tongues of fires, powerful like mailed soldiers, full of blessings like
the prayers of our fathers,

4\. Who hold together like the spokes of chariot-wheels, who glance
forward like victorious heroes, who scatter gh*ri*ta
[1](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:4:1) like wooing youths, who chant beautifully
like singers, intoning a hymn of praise,

5\. Who are swift like the best of horses, who are bounteous like lords
of chariots on a suit, who are hastening on like water with downward
floods, who are like the manifold [1](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:5:1) Aṅgiras
with their (numerous) songs.

6\. These noble sons of Sindhu [1](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:6:1) are like
grinding-stones, they are always like Soma-stones
[2](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:6:2), tearing everything to pieces; these sons
of a good mother are like playful children, they are by their glare like
a great troop on its march.

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

7\. Illumining the sacrifice [1](sbe3254.htm#an_10:78:7:1) like the rays
of the dawn, they shone forth in their ornaments like triumphant
warriors; the Maruts with bright spears seem like running rivers, from
afar they measure many miles.

8\. O gods, make us happy and rich, prospering us, your praisers, O
Maruts! Remember our praise and our friendship, for from of old there
are always with you gifts of treasures.

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Syûmara*s*mi Bhârgava. None of its verses occurs elsewhere.
Metre, I, 3, 4, 8 Trish*t*ubh; 2, 5-7 *G*agatî.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_10:78:4:1">1</span>. Gh*ri*taprush, Fett sprühend,
Gluth austheilend, according to Grassmann; gh*ri*ta-sprühend, according
to Ludwig. Sâya*n*a takes vareyáva*h* as wishing to give presents, and
explains that such gifts were preceded by a gift of water, so that
gh*ri*taprúsha*h* would mean, giving water or rain. The real meaning is
difficult.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_10:78:5:1">1</span>. Vi*s*varûpa may have been meant
in a more special and mythological sense.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_10:78:6:1">1</span>. Síndhu-mâtara*h* may be a synonym
of P*ris*ni-mâtara*h*, sindhu being used as a name of the water in the
sky. It may also mean, having the river Sindhu for their mother, i. e.
coming from the region of the river. Bergaigne translates (II, 397),
'qui ont pour mère la rivière céleste. Cette rivière peut être une des
formes de la vache qui passe aussi pour leur mère.'

Note <span id="an_10:78:6:2">2</span>. The grâ´vâ*n*a*h* and ádraya*h*
are probably meant for stones used for pounding corn and squeezing Soma.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_10:78:7:1">1</span>. On adhvara*s*rî, see Pischel,
Ved. Stud. p. 53.
