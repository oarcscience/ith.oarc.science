*Vedic Hymns, Part I (SBE32)*, by Max Müller, \[1891\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This subject is so important, and affects so large a number of passages
in the Veda, that it requires the <span class="margnote">The four
principal Pâdas.</span>most careful examination. The Vedic metres,
though at first sight very perplexing, are very simple, if reduced to
their primary elements. The authors of the Prâti*s*âkhyas have
elaborated a most complicated system. Counting the syllables in the most
mechanical manner, they have assigned nearly a hundred names to every
variety which they discovered in the hymns of the Rig-veda <span
id="fr_57"></span>[a](#fn_48.md). But they also observed that the
constituent elements of all these metres were really but four, (Sûtras
988, 989):

1\. The Gâyatra pâda, of eight syllables, ending in  ̆  ̄.

2\. The Vairâ*g*a pâda, of ten syllables, ending in  ̄  ̄.

3\. The Traish*t*ubha pâda, of eleven syllables, ending in  ̄  ̄.

4\. The *G*âgata pâda, of twelve syllables, ending in  ̆  ̄.

Then follows an important rule, Sûtra 990: 'The penultimate syllable,'
he says, in a Gâyatra and *G*âgata pâda is light (laghu), in a Vairâ*g*a
and Traish*t*ubha pâda heavy (guru).' This is called their v*ri*tta.

This word v*ri*tta, which is generally translated by metre, had
evidently originally a more special meaning. It meant the final rhythm,
or if we take it literally, the <span class="margnote">V*ri*tta =
versus.</span> turn of a line, for it is derived from v*ri*t, to turn.
Hence v*ri*tta is the same word as the Latin versus, verse; but I do not
wish to decide whether the connection between the two words is
historical, or simply etymological. In Latin, versus is always supposed
to have meant originally a furrow, then a line, then a verse. In
Sanskrit the metaphor that led to the formation of v*ri*tta, in the
sense of final rhythm, has nothing to do with ploughing. If, as I have
tried to prove (Chips from a German Workshop,

<span id="page_xcvi">p. xcvi</span>

vol. i, p. 84), the names assigned to metres and metrical language were
derived from words originally referring to choregic movements, v*ri*tta
must have meant the turn, i. e. the last step of any given movement; and
this turn, as determining the general character of the whole movement,
would naturally be regulated by more severe rules, while greater freedom
would be allowed for the rest.

Having touched on this subject, I may add another fact in support of my
view. The words Trish*t*ubh and Anush*t*ubh, names for the most common
metres, are generally derived from a root stubh, to praise. I believe
they should be derived from a root stubh, which is preserved in Greek,
not only in στυφελός, hard, στυφελίζω, to strike hard, but in the root
στεμφ, from which στέμφυλον, stamped or pressed olives or grapes, and
ἀστεμφής, untrodden (grapes), then unshaken; and in στέμβω, to shake, to
ram, στοβέω, to scold, &c. In Sanskrit this root is mentioned in the
Dhâtupâ*th*a X, 34, shtubhu stambhe, and it exists in a parallel form as
stambh, lit. to stamp down, then to fix, to make firm, with which Bopp
has compared the German stampfen, to stamp; (Glossarium, s. v. stambh.)
I therefore look upon Trish*t*ubh as meaning originally tripudium,
(supposing this word to be derived from tri and pes, according to the
expression in Horace, pepulisse ter pede terram, Hor. Od. iii. i8,) and
I explain its name 'Three-step,' by the fact that the three last
syllables  ̆  ̄  ̆, which form the characteristic feature of that metre,
and may be called its real v*ri*tta or turn, were audibly stamped at the
end of each turn or strophe. I explain Anush*t*ubh, which consists of
four equal pâdas, each of eight syllables, as the 'After-step,' because
each line was stamped regularly after the other, possibly by two
choruses, each side taking its turn. There is one passage in the Veda
where Anush*t*ubh seems to have preserved this meaning:

X, 124, 9. anu-stúbham ánu *k*ar*k*ûryámâ*n*am índram ní *k*ikyu*h*
kaváya*h* manîshâ´.

Poets by their wisdom discovered Indra dancing to an Anush*t*ubh.

In V, 52, 12, *kh*anda*h*-stúbha*h* kubhanyáva*h* útsam â´

<span id="page_xcvii">p. xcvii</span>

kîrí*n*a*h* n*ri*tu*h*, in measured steps (i. e. stepping the metre) and
wildly shouting the gleemen have danced toward the spring.

Other names of metres which point to a similar origin, i. e. to their
original connection with dances, are Pada-paṅkti, 'Step-row;'
Nyaṅku-sâri*n*î, 'Roe-step;' Abhisâri*n*î, 'Contre-danse,' &c.

If now we return to the statement of the Prâti*s*âkhya in reference to
the v*ri*ttas, we should observe how careful its author is in his
language. He does not say that the penultimate is long or short, but he
simply states, that, from a metrical point of view, it must be
considered as light or heavy, which need not mean more than that it must
be pronounced with or without stress. The fact that the author of the
Prâti*s*âkhya uses these terms, laghu and guru, instead of hrasva,
short, and dîrgha, long, shows in fact that he was aware that the
penultimate in these pâdas is not invariably long or short, though, from
a metrical point of view, it is always heavy or light.

It is perfectly true that if we keep to these four pâdas, (to which one
more pâda, viz. the half Vairâ*g*a, consisting of five syllables, might
be added) we can reduce nearly all the hymns of the Rig-veda to their
simple elements which the ancient poets combined together, in general in
a very simple way, but occasionally with greater freedom. The most
important strophes, formed out of these pâdas, are,

1\. Three Gâyatra pâdas = the Gâyatrî, (24 syllables.)

2\. Four Gâyatra pâdas = the Anush*t*ubh, (32 syllables.)

3\. Four Vairâ*g*a pâdas = the Virâ*g*, (40 syllables.)

4\. Four Traish*t*ubha pâdas = the Trish*t*ubh, (44 syllables.)

5\. Four *G*âgata pâdas = the *G*agatî, (48 syllables.)

Between the Gâyatrî and Anush*t*ubh strophes, another strophe may be
formed, by mixture of Gâyatra and *G*âgata pâdas, consisting of 28
syllables, and commonly called Ush*n*ih; likewise between the
Anush*t*ubh and the Virâ*g*, a strophe may be formed, consisting of 36
syllables, and commonly called B*ri*hatî.

In a collection of hymns, however, like that of the Rig-veda, where
poems of different ages, different places, and

<span id="page_xcviii">p. xcviii</span>

different families have been put together, we must be prepared for
exceptions to many rules. Thus, although the final turn of the
hendecasyllabic Traish*t*ubha is, as a rule, the bacchius,  ̆  ̄  ̄, yet if
we take, for instance, the 77th hymn of the tenth Ma*nd*ala, we clearly
perceive another hendecasyllabic pâda of a totally different structure,
and worked up into one of the most beautiful strophes by an ancient
poet. Each line is divided into two halves, the first consisting of
seven syllables, being an exact counterpart of the first member of a
Saturnian verse (fato Romae Metelli); the second a dijambus, answering
boldly to the broken rhythm of the first member <span
id="fr_58"></span>[a](#fn_49.md). We have, in fact, a Trish*t*ubh where the
turn or the three-step,  ̆  ̄  ̄, instead of being at the end, stands in
the middle of the line.

X, 77, 1-5, in the Pada text:

1\. ābhrā-prŭshā*h* nă vâ̄*k*â̄ ̍ prŭshă̅ văsū,  
   hăvīshmāntā*h* nă yā*gñ*â̄*h* ̍ vĭ-*g*â̄nŭshā*h* \| &c.

Another strophe, the nature of which has been totally misapprehended by
native metricians, occurs in IV, 10. It is there called Padapaṅkti and
Mahâpadapaṅkti; nay, attempts have been made to treat it even as an
Ush*n*ih, or as a kind of Gâyatrî. The real character of that strophe is
so palpable that it is difficult to understand how it could have been
mistaken. It consists of two lines, the first embracing three or four
feet of five syllables each, having the ictus on the first and the
fourth syllables, and resembling the last line of a Sapphic verse. The
second line is simply

<span id="page_xcix">p. xcix</span>

a Trish*t*ubh. It is what we should call an asynartete strophe, and the
contrast of the rhythm in the first and second lines is very effective.
I am not certain whether Professor Bollensen, who has touched on this
metre in an article just published (Zeitschrift der D. M. G., vol. xxii,
p. 572), shares this opinion. He has clearly seen that the division of
the lines, as given in the MSS. of the Sa*m*hitâ text, is wrong; but he
seems inclined to admit the same rhythm throughout, and to treat the
strophe as consisting of four lines of five syllables each, and one of
six syllables, which last line is to submit to the prevailing rhythm of
the preceding lines. If we differ, however, as to the internal
architecture of this strophe, we agree in condemning the interpretation
proposed by the Prâti*s*âkhya; and I should, in connection with this,
like to call attention to two important facts: first, that the Sa*m*hitâ
text, in not changing, for instance, the final t of martât, betrays
itself as clearly later than the elaboration of the ancient theory of
metres, later than the invention of such a metre as the Padapaṅkti; and
secondly, that the accentuation, too, of the Sa*m*hitâ is thus proved to
be posterior to the establishment of these fanciful metrical divisions,
and hence cannot throughout claim so irrefragable an authority as
certainly belongs to it in many cases. I give the Sa*m*hitâ text:

1\. Āgnē tăm ādyā \| āsvā*m* nă stōmāi*h* \| krătū*m* nă bhādrām,  
         h*rĭ*dīsp*rĭs*ăm *ri̅*dhy̆â̄mâ̄ tă ōhaī*h*.  
2. Ădhâ̄ hy āgnē \| krătōr bhādrāsyă \| dākshāsyă sâ̄dhō*h*,  
         răthî̄r *rĭ*tāsyă b*rĭ*hătō băbhû̄thā, &c.

Now it is perfectly true that, as a general rule, the syllables
composing the v*ri*tta or turn of the different metres, and described by
the Prâti*s*âkhya as heavy or light, are in reality long or short. The
question, however, is this, have we a right, or are we obliged, in cases
where that syllable is not either long or short, as it ought to be, so
to alter the text, or so to change the rules of pronunciation, that the
penultimate may again be what we wish it to be?

If we begin with the Gâyatra pâda, we have not to read

<span id="page_c">p. c</span>

long before we find that it would be hopeless to try to crush the
Gâyatrî verses of the Vedic *Ri*shis on this <span
class="margnote">Gâyatra Pâdas.</span>Procrustean bed. Even Professor
Kuhn very soon perceived that this was impossible. He had to admit that
in the Gâyatrî the two first pâdas, at all events, were free from this
rule, and though he tried to retain it for the third or final pâda, he
was obliged after a time to give it up even there. Again, it is
perfectly true, that in the third pâda of the Gâyatrî, and in the second
and fourth pâdas of the Anush*t*ubh strophe, greater care is taken by
the poets to secure a short syllable for the penultimate, but here, too,
exceptions cannot be entirely removed. We have only to take such a
single hymn as I, 27, and we shall see that it would be impossible to
reduce it to the uniform standard of Gâyatrî pâdas, all ending in a
dijambus.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[xcv:a](sbe3212.htm#fr_57.md) See Appendix to my
edition of the Prâti*s*âkhya, p. ccclvi.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[xcviii:a](sbe3212.htm#fr_58.md) Professor Kuhn
(vol. iii, p. 450) is inclined to admit the same metre as varying in
certain hymns with ordinary Traish*t*ubha pâdas, but the evidence he
brings forward is hardly sufficient. Even if we object to the endings
 ̆  ̄  ̆  ̄ and  ̄  ̄  ̆  ̄, V, 33, 4, may be a *G*âgata, with vyûha of dâsa,
the remark quoted from the Prâti*s*âkhya being of no consequence on such
points; and the same remedy would apply to V, 41, 5, with vyûha of eshe.
In VI, 47, 31, vyûha of a*s*vapar*n*ai*h*; in I, 33, 9, vyûha of indra
and rodasî; in II, 24, 5, vyûha of mâdbhi*h* would produce the same
effect; while in I, 121, 8, we must either admit the Traish*t*ubha
v*ri*tta  ̄  ̆  ̄ or scan dhūksh̆ān. In III, 58, 6, I should admit vyûha for
năr̆â̄; in IV, 26, 6, for māndr̆ām; in I, 100, 8, for gy̆ōtī*h*, always
supposing that we consider the ending  ̄  ̄  ̆  ̄ incompatible with a
Trish*t*ubh verse.
