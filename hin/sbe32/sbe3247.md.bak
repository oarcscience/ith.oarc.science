### MA*ND*ALA VII, HYMN 57.

##### ASH*T*AKA V, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 27.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. O ye worshipful, your company of Maruts is fond of honey, they who
delight in their strength at the sacrifices, the Maruts, who shake even
the wide heaven and earth, and fill the well, when they move about, the
terrible ones.

2\. Truly the Maruts find out the man who praises them, and guide the
thoughts of the sacrificer. Sit down then to rejoice to-day, on the
altar [1](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:2:1.md) in our assemblies
[2](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:2:2.md) well pleased.

3\. Others do not shine so much as these Maruts with their golden
chains, their weapons, and their own bodies; the all-adorned, adorning
heaven and earth, brighten themselves with the same brightness, when
starting for triumph.

4\. May your shining thunderbolt be far from us, O Maruts, whatever sin
we may commit against you, men as we are: O worshipful, let us not fall
under [1](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:4:1.md) its power, let your best favour rest
on us.

5\. May the Maruts be pleased with whatever little we have done here,
they the faultless, the bright, the pure. Protect us, ye worshipful,
with your favours, lead us to prosperity through booty.

6\. And let the manly Maruts, when they have been praised, under
whatever names, enjoy these offerings! Grant that our offspring may not
die [1](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:6:1.md), raise up for us riches
[2](sbe3247.htm#an_7:57:6:2.md), glory, and wealth.

7\. O Maruts, when you have thus been praised, come all together with
help towards our lords who with their hundredfold wealth freely prosper
us;—protect us always with your favours!

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Vasish*th*a. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV.,
TS., TB., MS. Metre, Trish*t*ubh.

##### Verse 1.

This hymn has been translated by Geldner and Kaegi. The first verse is
most difficult. G.-K. avoid all difficulties by translating, 'Beim Fest
des süssen Trankes weiss man tüchtig euch zu begeistern, hehre Schaar
der Marut.' Ludwig grapples with them by translating; 'An eures madhu
kraft, o zu vererende, freut bei den opfern sich der Marut geschlecht.'
I doubt, however, whether *s*avas is ever ascribed to madhu, though it
is ascribed to Soma. Oldenberg suggests, ‘The sweet ones’ is your
Marut-name, O worshipful, they who rejoice in their strength at the
sacrifices.’ Here the difficulty would be that Mârutam nâma is the
recognised term for the name, i. e. the kin of the Maruts. Still, unless
we venture on a conjecture, this would seem to be the best rendering.
Could we change mádhva*h* va*h* nâ´ma mâ´rutam into madhvád va*h* nâ´ma
mâ´rutam? Madhvád is a Vedic word, though it occurs once only, in I,
164, 22, and as trisyllabic. Its very rarity would help to account for
the change. The meaning would then be, 'your Marut kin eats honey, is
fond of honey.'

It has been proved that the present mádati is always neutral, meaning to
rejoice, while mand (Par.) is transitive, to make rejoice. Otherwise
madhva*h* might possibly have been taken in the sense of sweet things,
as in I, 180, 4; IX, 89, 3, and construed with madanti.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_7:57:2:1">1</span>. Barhis, which I translate by
altar, is the simplest form of an altar, mere turf or ku*s*a-grass, on
which the offerings are placed. See note to VII, 46, 4.

Note <span id="an_7:57:2:2">2</span>. On vidatha, see my note, V, 59, 2.

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

##### Verse 3.

See Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 241; his rendering would be acceptable but
for the â. Without any verb of motion â ra*g*as can hardly mean 'through
the air,' nor â´ ródasî 'through the worlds.'

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_7:57:4:1">1</span>. On api bhû and api as, see B.-R.
s. v.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_7:57:6:1">1</span>. Am*ri*ta cannot be rendered by
immortality in our sense, it simply means not dying.

Note <span id="an_7:57:6:2">2</span>. *G*ig*ri*tá, imp. aor. caus. of
gar. Râyá*h*, acc. plur.
