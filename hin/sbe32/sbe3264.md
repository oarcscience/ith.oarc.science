Note that the original lexicographic ordering of this index, preserved
in this transcription, is based on the Sanskrit alphabet. Also see the
transcription notes, below.—*JBH*

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> following Index of Words was
commenced by Professor Thibaut, and continued and finished by Dr.
Winternitz. I beg to express my gratitude to both of them, more
particularly to Dr. Winternitz, who has spared no pains in order to make
the Index as complete and as accurate as possible.—F. M. M.

The Index contains all the words of the hymns translated in this volume,
and besides, all the words about which something is said in the Notes.

The lists of passages are complete, except when three dots (…) are put
after the word (e. g. á*kkh*a …).

Three figures refer to Ma*nd*ala, hymn, and verse, a small figure to a
note, e. g. X, 77, 2:1, stands for Ma*nd*ala X, hymn 77, verse 2, note 1
(the word occurs in X, 77, 2, and also in note 1).

If a word occurs in a note only, the passage is put in parentheses,
e. g. (V, 61, 4<sup>1</sup>) means that the word occurs in note 1 on V,
61, 4, but *not* in V, 61, 4.

In the case of longer notes, it seemed advisable to refer to the page.
*One* number refers to the page, e. g. (287) means that the word occurs
in a note on page 287.

#### NOTES ON THE TRANSCRIPTION OF THIS INDEX.

The format of this transcription of the index varies slightly from the
printed version so that this section can be parsed automatically if
needed.

In the printed edition, the main entry appeared on a line by itself,
followed by a colon, with successive forms on the next line indented one
level. Sub-entries appeared on separate lines, with more indentation.
The entries have been, essentially, flattened in this transcription: in
other words, there is a one-to-one correspondence between entries and
lines.

Only explicit page number references have been hyperlinked.

In the printed version, footnotes are indicated by superscripts. In this
transcription, footnotes are prefixed by a colon following the verse
number. For instance, X, 77, 2:1 originally appeared as X, 77,
2<sup>1</sup>. In the case where multiple superscripts appeared, a colon
followed by the footnotes in square brackets: X, 77, 2:\[1, 2\] was
originally X, 77, 2<sup>1, 2</sup>. However, footnotes with lowercase
letters (a, b, c, etc.) are transcribed with a superscript, e. g. Note
<sup>a</sup>, as in the original. This only applies to the Index of
Words section: everywhere else in the transcription of this book,
superscripts are used to indicate footnotes as in the original.—*JBH*
