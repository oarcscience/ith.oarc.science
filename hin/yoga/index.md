#### Yogi Publication Society

These are the Yogi Publication Society books specifically themed around
Yoga, authored by William Atkinson under a variety of pseudonyms. There
were many others published by the YPS, some of which can be found on the
[Esoteric Page](../../eso/index.md). This is because they reflect Western
Esoteric beliefs, rather than Hinduism, or Yogic knowledge.
