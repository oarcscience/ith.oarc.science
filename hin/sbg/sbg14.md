### NINTH CHAPTER

The Blessed Lord said:

1\. To thee, who dost not carp, verily shall I now declare this, the
most profound knowledge, united with realisation, having known which,
thou shalt be free from evil (Samsâra).

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

2\. Of sciences, the highest; of profundities, the deepest; of
purifiers, the supreme, is this; realisable by direct perception,
endowed with (immense) merit, very easy to perform, and of an
imperishable nature.

3\. Persons without Shraddhâ for this Dharma, return, O scorcher of
foes, without attaining Me, to the path of re-birth fraught with
death. <span id="fr_195"></span>[3](#fn_195)

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

4\. All this world is pervaded by me in My unmanifested form: all beings
exist in Me, but I do not dwell in them. <span
id="fr_196"></span>[4](#fn_196)

5\. Nor do beings exist in Me (in reality), behold My Divine Yoga!
Bringing forth and supporting the beings, My Self does not dwell in
them. <span id="fr_197"></span>[5](#fn_197)

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

6\. As the mighty wind, moving always everywhere, rests ever in the
Akâsha, know thou, that even so do all beings rest in Me. <span
id="fr_198"></span>[6](#fn_198)

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

7\. At the end of a Kalpa, O son of Kunti, all beings go back to My
Prakriti: at the beginning of (another) Kalpa, I send them forth
again. <span id="fr_199"></span>[7](#fn_199)

8\. Animating My Prakriti, I project again and again this whole
multitude of beings, helpless under the sway of Prakriti. <span
id="fr_200"></span>[8](#fn_200)

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

9\. These acts do not bind Me, sitting as one neutral, unattached to
them, O Dhananjaya. <span id="fr_201"></span>[9](#fn_201)

10\. By reason of My proximity, Prakriti produces all this, the moving
and the unmoving; the world wheels round and round, O son of Kunti,
because of this. <span id="fr_202"></span>[10](#fn_202)

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

11\. Unaware of My higher state, as the great Lord of beings, fools
disregard Me, dwelling in the human form. <span
id="fr_203"></span>[11](#fn_203)

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

12\. Of vain hopes, of vain works, of vain knowledge, and senseless,
they verily are possessed of the delusive nature of Râkshasas and
Asuras. <span id="fr_204"></span>[12](#fn_204)

13\. But the great-souled ones, O son

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

of Prithâ, possessed of the Divine Prakriti, knowing Me to be the origin
of beings, and immutable, worship Me with a single mind. <span
id="fr_205"></span>[13](#fn_205)

14\. Glorifying Me always and striving with firm resolve, bowing down to
Me in devotion, always steadfast, they worship Me.

15\. Others, too, sacrificing by the Yajna of knowledge (*i.e.*, seeing
the Self in all), worship Me the All-Formed, as one, as distinct, as
manifold. <span id="fr_206"></span>[15](#fn_206)

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

16\. I am the Kratu, I the Yajna, I the Svadhâ, I the Aushadham, I the
Mantra, I the Ajyam, I the fire, and I the oblation. <span
id="fr_207"></span>[16](#fn_207)

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

17\. I am the Father of this world, the Mother, the Sustainer, the
Grandfather; the Purifier, the (one) thing to be known, (the syllable)
Om, and also the Rik, Sâman and Yajus. <span
id="fr_208"></span>[17](#fn_208)

18\. The Goal, the Supporter, the Lord, the Witness, the Abode, the
Refuge, the Friend, the Origin, the Dissolution, the Substratum, the
Storehouse, the Seed immutable. <span id="fr_209"></span>[18](#fn_209)

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

19\. (As sun) I give heat: I withhold and send forth rain; I am
immortality and also death; being and non-being am I, O Arjuna! <span
id="fr_210"></span>[19](#fn_210)

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

20\. The knowers of the three Vedas, worshipping Me by Yajna, drinking
the Soma, and (thus) being purified from sin, pray for passage to
heaven; reaching the holy world of the Lord of the Devas, they enjoy in
heaven the divine pleasures of the Devas. <span
id="fr_211"></span>[20](#fn_211)

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

21\. Having enjoyed the vast Swarga-world, they enter the mortal world,
on the exhaustion of their merit: Thus, abiding by the injunctions of
the three (Vedas), desiring desires, they (constantly) come and
go. <span id="fr_212"></span>[21](#fn_212)

22\. Persons who, meditating on Me as non-separate, worship Me in all
beings, to them thus ever jealously engaged, I carry what they lack and
preserve what they already have. <span id="fr_213"></span>[22](#fn_213)

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

23\. Even those devotees, who endued with Shraddhâ, worship other gods,
they too worship Me alone, O son of Kunti, (but) by the wrong
method. <span id="fr_214"></span>[23](#fn_214)

24\. For I alone am the Enjoyer, and Lord of all Yajnas; but because
they do not know Me in reality, they return, (to the mortal
world). <span id="fr_215"></span>[24](#fn_215)

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

25\. Votaries of the Devas go to the Devas; to the Pitris, go their
votaries; to the Bhutas, go the Bhuta worshippers; My votaries too come
unto Me. <span id="fr_216"></span>[25](#fn_216)

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

26\. Whoever with devotion offers Me a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or
water, that I accept—the devout gift of the pure-minded. <span
id="fr_217"></span>[26](#fn_217)

27\. Whatever thou doest, whatever thou eatest, whatever thou offerest
in sacrifice, whatever thou givest away, whatever austerity thou
practisest, O son of Kunti, do that as an offering unto Me.

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

28\. Thus shalt thou be freed from the bondages of actions, bearing good
and evil results: with the heart steadfast in the Yoga of renunciation,
and liberated, thou shalt come unto Me. <span
id="fr_218"></span>[28](#fn_218)

29\. I am the same to all beings: to Me there is none hateful or dear.
But those who worship Me with devotion, are in Me, and I too am in
them. <span id="fr_219"></span>[29](#fn_219)

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

30\. If even a very wicked person worships Me, with devotion to none
else, he should be regarded as good, for he has rightly resolved. <span
id="fr_220"></span>[30](#fn_220)

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

31\. Soon does he become righteous, and attain eternal Peace, O son of
Kunti boldly canst thou proclaim, that My devotee is never destroyed.

32\. For, taking refuge in Me, they also, O son of Prithâ, who might be
of inferior birth,—women, Vaishyas, as well as Sudras,—even they attain
to the Supreme Goal. <span id="fr_221"></span>[32](#fn_221)

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

33\. What need to mention holy Brâhmanas, and devoted Râjarshis! Having
obtained this transient, joyless world, worship thou Me. <span
id="fr_222"></span>[33](#fn_222)

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

34\. Fill thy mind with Me, be My devotee, sacrifice unto Me, bow down
to Me; thus having made thy heart steadfast in Me, taking Me as the
Supreme Goal, thou shalt come to Me.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_195"></span>[198:3](sbg14.htm#fr_195) *Without . . .
Dharma:* Who have no faith in this knowledge of the Self, regarding the
physical body itself as the Self.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[199:4](sbg14.htm#fr_196) *Unmanifested:* being
invisible to the senses.

*Exist in Me*—have an individual existence through Me, the Self,
underlying them all.

*Do not dwell in them*—like corporeal things—in contact with them, or
contained as though in a receptacle.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[199:5](sbg14.htm#fr_197) <span
id="page_200">p. 200</span> Vide vii. 12.

*Nor do &c.*—Because of the Self Being unattached to or unconnected with
any object. "Devoid of attachment. He is never attached."—*Brih. Upa.*
III—ix-26.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[200:6](sbg14.htm#fr_198) *Rests ever in the
Akâsha*—without being attached to it.

The idea is that beings rest in the Lord without contact with, and so
without producing any effect on Him.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[201:7](sbg14.htm#fr_199) *Prakriti:* The
inferior one composed of the three Gunas.

*Kalpa*—a period of cosmic manifestation.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[201:8](sbg14.htm#fr_200) *Animating My
Prakriti*—invigorating and fertilising the Prakriti dependent on Him,
which had gone to sleep at the universal dissolution, at the end of the
Kalpa.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[202:9](sbg14.htm#fr_201) *These acts*—which
involve the unequal creation and dissolution of the universe.

As in the case of Ishvara, so in the case of others also, the absence of
the egotistic feeling of agency and attachment for results, is the cause
of freedom (from Dharma and Adharma).

<span id="fn_202"></span>[202:10](sbg14.htm#fr_202) In verses VII to X
the Lord defines His position, following the Arundhati Nyâya. When a
bride is brought to her husband's house for the first time, he shows her
a very tiny star, called Arundhati. To do this, he has to direct her
gaze the right way, <span id="page_203">p. 203</span> which he does by
asking her to look at something near and something big, in the direction
of the star, *e.g.*, a branch of a tree. Next, he draws her attention to
a large bright star observed beyond this branch, and so on, till by
several steps, he succeeds in leading her eyes to the right thing. This
method of leading to a subtle object through easy steps, is called
Arundhati Nyâya. The Lord begins by stating that He projects all beings
at the beginning of evolution: Prakriti is only an instrument in His
hands. Next, He says, He is not affected by that act, since He sits by,
as one neutral, perfectly unattached. Lastly, He leads up to the final
truth that really He does nothing, that it is Prakriti, who animated by
His proximity produces all that is. It is His Light that lights up
Prakriti, and makes her live and act. That is all the relation between
Him and her.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[203:11](sbg14.htm#fr_203) *Great Lord*—Supreme
Self.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[204:12](sbg14.htm#fr_204) *Vain*—because they
neglect their own Self. They see no Self beyond the body.

*They*—refers to those described in the preceding Sloka.

Râkshasas have Râjasika nature, Asuras, Tâmasika.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[205:13](sbg14.htm#fr_205) *Divine:* Sâttvika.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[205:15](sbg14.htm#fr_206) *All-Formed:* He who
has assumed all the manifold forms in the universe.

*As one*—identifying himself with the All-Formed;—the Advaita view.

*As distinct*—making a distinction in essence between the Lord and
himself:—the Dualistic view.

*As manifold*—as the various divinities, Brahma, Rudra &c.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[206:16](sbg14.htm#fr_207) *Kratu* is a
particular Vedic rite.

*Yajna:* The worship enjoined in the Smriti.

*Svadhâ:* food offered to the manes (Pitris).

*Aushadham:* all vegetable food and medicinal herbs.

*Mantra:* the chant with which oblation is offered. Ajyam: articles of
oblation.

*The fire*—into which the offering is poured.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[207:17](sbg14.htm#fr_208) *Sustainer*—by
dispensing fruit of action.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[207:18](sbg14.htm#fr_209) <span
id="page_208">p. 208</span> *Seed:* cause of the origin of all things.

*Immutable*—because it endures so long as the Samsâra endures.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[208:19](sbg14.htm#fr_210) *Being:* The
manifested world of effects.

*Non-being*—means, the cause which is unmanifested only, and not
non-existence; otherwise we have to conceive existence coming out of
nonexistence, which is absurd. The Sruti says, "How can existence come
out of non-existence?"—*Chhand. Upa.* 6.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[209:20](sbg14.htm#fr_211) *Lord of the
Devas*—Indra, who is called Satakratu, because he had performed a
hundred sacrifices.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[210:21](sbg14.htm#fr_212)
*Injunctions*—Ritualistic, the Karma-Kânda.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[210:22](sbg14.htm#fr_213) *Ananyâh*—as
non-separate, *i.e.*, looking upon the Supreme Being as not separate
from their own self. Or Ananyâh may mean, without any other (thought).
Then the translation of the Sloka should be—persons who worship Me in
all beings, never harbouring any other thought, to them &c.

*I carry &c.*—Because while other devotees work for their own gain and
safety, those who do not see <span id="page_211">p. 211</span> anything
as separate from themselves, do not do so; they even do not cherish a
desire for life; so the Lord secures to them gain and safety.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[211:23](sbg14.htm#fr_214) *Wrong
method*—ignorantly, not in the way by which they can get Moksha.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[211:24](sbg14.htm#fr_215) <span
id="page_212">p. 212</span> *They return*—by worshipping other gods they
attain no doubt to the spheres of their sacrifice, but after the
exhaustion of this merit, they fall from those spheres and return to the
mortal world.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[212:25](sbg14.htm#fr_216) *Bhutas*—beings
lower than the Devas, but higher than human beings.

*Me*—The Imperishable.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[213:26](sbg14.htm#fr_217) Not only does the
single-minded devotion to the Supreme lead to imperishable result, but
it is also so easy and simple to perform,—says Krishna in this Sloka.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[214:28](sbg14.htm#fr_218) *The Yoga of
renunciation*—This way of purification of the heart by offering
everything to the Lord.

*Liberated &c.*—thou shalt be liberated while in the body, and at its
death, become Me.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[214:29](sbg14.htm#fr_219) I am like fire. As
fire gives heat to those who draw near to it, and not to those who move
away from it, even so do I. My grace falls upon My <span
id="page_215">p. 215</span> devotees, but not owing to any attachment on
My part. As the sun's light, though pervading everywhere, is reflected
in a clean mirror, so also I, the Supreme Lord, present as a matter of
course everywhere, manifest Myself in those persons only, from whose
minds all the dirt of ignorance has been removed by devotion.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[215:30](sbg14.htm#fr_220) *He has rightly
resolved*—He is one who has formed a holy resolution, to abandon the
evil ways of his life.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[216:32](sbg14.htm#fr_221) *Of inferior birth .
. . Sudras*—Because by birth, the Vaishyas are engaged only in
agriculture &c., and the women and Sudras are debarred from the study of
the Vedas.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[217:33](sbg14.htm#fr_222) *Râjarshis*—kings
who have attained to sainthood (Rishihood).

*What need &c.:* How much more easily then do the holy Brâhmanas and the
devoted royal saints attain that Goal!

*Having . . . world*—Being born in this human body which is hard to get,
one should exert oneself immediately for perfection, without depending
on the future, as everything in this world is transient, and without
seeking for happiness, as this world is joyless.
