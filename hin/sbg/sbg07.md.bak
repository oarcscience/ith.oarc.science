### SECOND CHAPTER

Sanjaya said:

1\. To him who was thus overwhelmed with pity and sorrowing, and whose
eyes were dimmed with tears, Madhusudana spoke these words: <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md)

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

2\. In such a crisis, whence comes upon thee, O Arjuna, this dejection,
un-Aryalike, disgraceful and contrary to the attainment of heaven? <span
id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md)

3\. Yield not to unmanliness, O son of Prithâ! Ill doth it become thee.
Cast off this mean faint-heartedness and arise, O scorcher of thine
enemies!

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

Arjuna said:

4\. —But how can I, in battle, O slayer of Madhu, fight with arrows
against Bhishma and Drona, who are rather worthy to be worshipped, O
destroyer of foes!

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

5\. Surely it would be better even to eat the bread of beggary in this
life than to slay these great-souled masters. But if I kill them, even
in this world, all my enjoyment of wealth and desires will be stained
with blood. <span id="fr_18"></span>[5](#fn_18.md)

6\. And indeed I can scarcely tell which will be better, that we should
conquer them, or that they should conquer us. The very sons of
Dhritarâshtra,—after slaying whom we should not care to live,—stand
facing us.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

7\. With my nature overpowered by weak commiseration, with a mind in
confusion about duty, I supplicate Thee. Say decidedly what is good for
me. I am Thy disciple. Instruct me who have taken refuge in Thee. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[7](#fn_19.md)

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

8\. I do not see anything to remove this sorrow which blasts my senses,
even were I to obtain unrivalled and flourishing dominion over the
earth, and mastery over the gods.

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

Sanjaya said:

9\. Having spoken thus to the Lord of the senses, Gudâkesha, the
scorcher of foes, said to Govinda, "I shall not fight," and became
silent. <span id="fr_20"></span>[9](#fn_20.md)

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

10\. To him who was sorrowing in the midst of the two armies,
Hrishikesha, as if smiling, O descendant of Bharata! spoke these
words. <span id="fr_21"></span>[10](#fn_21.md)

The Blessed Lord said:

11\. Thou hast been mourning for them who should not be mourned for. Yet
thou speakest words of wisdom. The (truly) wise grieve neither for the
living nor the dead. <span id="fr_22"></span>[11](#fn_22.md)

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

12\. It is not that I have never existed, nor thou, nor these kings. Nor
is it that we shall cease to exist in the future. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[12](#fn_23.md)

13\. As are childhood, youth, and old age, in this body, to the embodied
soul, so

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

also is the attaining of another body. Calm souls are not deluded
thereat. <span id="fr_24"></span>[13](#fn_24.md)

14\. Notions of heat and cold, of pain and pleasure, are born, O son of
Kunti, only of the contact of the senses with their objects. They have a
beginning and an end. They are impermanent in their nature. Bear them
patiently, O descendant of Bharata. <span id="fr_25"></span>[14](#fn_25.md)

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

15\. That calm man who is the same in pain and pleasure, whom these
cannot disturb, alone is able, O great amongst men, to attain to
immortality. <span id="fr_26"></span>[15](#fn_26.md)

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

16\. The unreal never is. The Real never is not. Men possessed of the
knowledge of the Truth fully know both these. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[16](#fn_27.md)

17\. That by which all this is pervaded,—That know for certain to be
indestructible. None has the power to destroy this Immutable. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[17](#fn_28.md)

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

18\. Of this indwelling Self, the ever-changeless, the indestructible,
the illimitable,—these bodies are said to have an end. Fight therefore,
O descendant of Bharata. <span id="fr_29"></span>[18](#fn_29.md)

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

19\. He who takes the Self to be the slayer, he who takes It to be the
slain, neither of these knows. It does not slay, nor is It slain. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[19](#fn_30.md)

20\. This in never born, nor does It die. It is not that not having been
It again comes into being. (Or according to another view: It is not that
having been It again ceases to be). This is unborn, eternal, changeless,
ever-Itself. It is not killed when the body is killed. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[20](#fn_31.md)

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

21\. He that knows This to be indestructible, changeless, without birth,
and immutable, how is he, O son of Prithâ, to slay or cause another to
slay? <span id="fr_32"></span>[21](#fn_32.md)

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

22\. Even as a man casts off worn-out clothes, and puts on others which
are new, so the embodied casts off worn-out bodies, and enters into
others which are new. <span id="fr_33"></span>[22](#fn_33.md)

23\. This (Self), weapons cut not; This, fire burns not; This, water
wets not; and This, wind dries not.

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

24\. This Self cannot be cut, nor burnt, nor wetted, nor dried.
Changeless, all-pervading, unmoving, immovable, the Self is eternal.

25\. This (Self) is said to be unmanifested, unthinkable, and
unchangeable. Therefore, knowing This to be such, thou oughtest not to
mourn. <span id="fr_34"></span>[25](#fn_34.md)

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

26\. But if thou shouldst take This to have constant birth and death,
even in that case, O mighty-armed, thou oughtest not to mourn for
This. <span id="fr_35"></span>[26](#fn_35.md)

27\. Of that which is born, death is certain, of that which is dead,
birth is certain. Over the unavoidable, therefore, thou oughtest not to
grieve. <span id="fr_36"></span>[27](#fn_36.md)

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

28\. All beings are unmanifested in their beginning, O Bhârata,
manifested in their middle state and unmanifested again in their end.
What is there then to grieve about? <span id="fr_37"></span>[28](#fn_37.md)

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

29\. Some look upon the Self as marvellous. Others speak of It as
wonderful. Others again hear of It as a wonder. And still others, though
hearing, do not understand It at all. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[29](#fn_38.md)

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

30\. This, the Indweller in the bodies of all, is ever indestructible, O
descendant of Bharata. Wherefore thou oughtest not to mourn for any
creature. <span id="fr_39"></span>[30](#fn_39.md)

31\. Looking at thine own Dharma, also, thou oughtest not to waver, for
there is nothing higher for a Kshatriya than a righteous war. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[31](#fn_40.md)

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

32\. Fortunate certainly are the Kshatriyas, O son of Prithâ, who are
called to fight in such a battle, that comes unsought as an open gate to
heaven. <span id="fr_41"></span>[32](#fn_41.md)

33\. But if thou refusest to engage in this righteous warfare, then,
forfeiting thine own Dharma and honour, thou shalt incur sin.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

34\. The world also will ever hold thee in reprobation. To the honoured,
disrepute is surely worse than death. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[34](#fn_42.md)

35\. The great chariot-warriors <span id="fr_43"></span>[\*](#fn_43.md)
will believe that thou hast withdrawn from the battle through fear. And
thou wilt be lightly esteemed by them who have thought much of thee.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

36\. Thine enemies also, cavilling at thy great prowess, will say of
thee things that are not to be uttered. What could be more intolerable
than this?

37\. Dying thou gainest heaven; conquering thou enjoyest the earth.
Therefore, O son of Kunti, arise, resolved to fight.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

38\. Having made pain and pleasure, gain and loss, conquest and defeat,
the same, engage thou then in battle. So shalt thou incur no sin. <span
id="fr_44"></span>[38](#fn_44.md)

39\. The wisdom of Self-realisation has been declared unto thee. Hearken
thou now to the wisdom of Yoga, endued with which, O son of Prithâ, thou
shalt break through the bonds of Karma. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[39](#fn_45.md)

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

40\. In this, there is no waste of the unfinished attempt, nor is there
production of contrary results. Even very little of this Dharma protects
from the great terror. <span id="fr_46"></span>[52](#fn_46.md)

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

41\. In this, O scion of Kuru, there is but a single one-pointed
determination. The purposes of the undecided are innumerable and
many-branching. <span id="fr_47"></span>[53](#fn_47.md)

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

42-44. O Pârtha, no set determination is formed in the minds of those
that are deeply attached to pleasure and power, and whose discrimination
is stolen away by the flowery words of the unwise, who are full of
desires and look upon heaven as their highest goal and who, taking
pleasure in the panegyric words of the Vedas, declare that there is
nothing else. Their (flowery) words are exuberant with various specific,
rites as the means to pleasure and power and are the causes of

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (new) births as
the result of their works (performed with desire). <span
id="fr_48"></span>[42](#fn_48.md)

45\. The Vedas deal with the three Gunas. Be thou free, O Arjuna, from
the triad of the Gunas, free from the pairs of opposites, ever-balanced,
free from (the thought of) getting and keeping, and established in the
Self. <span id="fr_49"></span>[45](#fn_49.md)

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

46\. To the Brâhmana who has known the Self, all the Vedas are of so
much use as a reservoir is, when there is a flood everywhere. <span
id="fr_50"></span>[46](#fn_50.md)

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

47\. Thy right is to work only; but never to the fruits thereof. Be thou
not the producer of the fruits of (thy) actions; neither let thy
attachment be towards inaction. <span id="fr_51"></span>[47](#fn_51.md)

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

48\. Being steadfast in Yoga, Dhananjaya, perform actions, abandoning
attachment, remaining unconcerned as regards success and failure. This
evenness. of mind (in regard to success and failure) is known as Yoga.

49\. Work (with desire) is verily far inferior to that performed with
the mind undisturbed by thoughts of results. O

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dhananjaya, seek
refuge in this evenness of mind. Wretched are they who act for results.

50\. Endued with this evenness of mind, one frees oneself in this life,
alike from vice and virtue. Devote thyself, therefore, to this Yoga.
Yoga is the very dexterity of work. <span id="fr_52"></span>[50](#fn_52.md)

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

51\. The wise, possessed of this evenness of mind, abandoning the fruits
of their actions, freed for ever from the fetters of birth, go to that
state which is beyond all evil.

52\. When thy intellect crosses beyond the taint of illusion, then shalt
thou attain to indifference, regarding things heard and things yet to be
heard. <span id="fr_53"></span>[52](#fn_53.md)

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

53\. When thy intellect, tossed about by the conflict of opinions—has
become immovable and firmly established in the Self, then thou shalt
attain Self-realisation.

Arjuna said:

54\. What, O Keshava, is the description of the man of steady wisdom,
merged in Samâdhi? How (on the other hand) does the man of steady wisdom
speak, how sit, how walk? <span id="fr_54"></span>[54](#fn_54.md)

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

55\. When a man completely casts away, O Pârtha, all the desires of the
mind, satisfied in the Self alone by the Self, then is he said to be one
of steady wisdom. <span id="fr_55"></span>[55](#fn_55.md)

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

56\. He whose mind is not shaken by adversity, who does not hanker after
happiness, who has become free from affection, fear, and wrath, is
indeed the Muni of steady wisdom. <span id="fr_56"></span>[63](#fn_56.md)

57\. He who is everywhere unattached, not pleased at receiving good, nor
vexed at evil, his wisdom is fixed. <span id="fr_57"></span>[57](#fn_57.md)

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

58\. When also, like the tortoise its limbs, he can completely withdraw
the senses from their objects, then his wisdom becomes steady. <span
id="fr_58"></span>[58](#fn_58.md)

59\. Objects fall away from the abstinent man, leaving the longing
behind. But his longing also ceases, who sees the Supreme. <span
id="fr_59"></span>[59](#fn_59.md)

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

60\. The turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, do violently snatch away the
mind of even a wise man, striving after perfection.

61\. The steadfast, having controlled them all, sits focussed on Me as
the Supreme. His wisdom is steady, whose senses are under control.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

62\. Thinking of objects, attachment to them is formed in a man. From
attachment longing, and from longing anger grows.

63\. From anger comes delusion, and from delusion loss of memory. From
loss of memory comes the ruin of discrimination, and from the ruin of
discrimination he perishes. <span id="fr_60"></span>[63](#fn_60.md)

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

64\. But the self-controlled man, moving among objects with senses under
restraint, and free from attraction and aversion, attains to
tranquillity. <span id="fr_61"></span>[64](#fn_61.md)

65\. In tranquillity, all sorrow is destroyed. For the intellect of him
who is tranquil-minded, is soon established in firmness. <span
id="fr_62"></span>[65](#fn_62.md)

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

66\. No knowledge (of the Self) has the unsteady. Nor has he meditation.
To the unmeditative there is no peace. And how can one without peace
have happiness?

67\. For, the mind which follows in the wake of the wandering senses,
carries away his discrimination, as a wind (carries away from its
course) a boat on the waters.

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

68\. Therefore, O mighty-armed, his knowledge is steady, whose senses
are completely restrained from their objects. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[68](#fn_63.md)

69\. That which is night to all beings, in that the self-controlled man
wakes. That in which all beings wake, is night to the Self-seeing
Muni. <span id="fr_64"></span>[69](#fn_64.md)

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

70\. As into the ocean,—brimful, and still,—flow the waters, even so the
Muni into whom enter all desires, he, and not the desirer of desires,
attains to peace. <span id="fr_65"></span>[70](#fn_65.md)

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

71\. That man who lives devoid of longing, abandoning all desires,
without the sense of 'I' and 'mine,' he attains to peace. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[71](#fn_66.md)

72\. This is to have one's being in Brahman, O son of Prithâ. None,
attaining to this, becomes deluded. Being established therein, even at
the end of life, a man attains to oneness with Brahman.

The end of second chapter, designated <span class="smallcaps">The Way of
Knowledge</span>.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[27:1](sbg07.htm#fr_16.md) *Overwhelmed with pity:*
Not Arjuna, but Arjuna's feeling was master of the situation.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[28:2](sbg07.htm#fr_17.md) Mark with what contempt
Krishna regards Arjuna's attitude of weakness masked by religious
expression!

<span id="fn_18"></span>[30:5](sbg07.htm#fr_18.md) *i.e.* even in this
world I shall be in hell.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[31:7](sbg07.htm#fr_19.md) *Dharma* is the *ness*,
the law of the inmost constitution of a thing. The primary meaning of
Dharma is not virtue or religion, but that is only its secondary
significance. Fighting in a just cause is the religious duty or Dharma
of a Kshatriya, while the same is a sin to a Brâhmana, because it is
contrary to the law of his being. Working out one's Karma according to
the law of one's own being is <span id="page_32">p. 32</span> therefore
the Dharma or religion or way to salvation of an individual. The cloud
of Karma hides the Self-Sun from view. The means which exhausts this
cloud without adding to it and thus helps in one's Self-restoration is
one's Dharma.

*Thy disciple:* Until this declaration has been made, the Master may not
give the highest knowledge.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[33:9](sbg07.htm#fr_20.md) The object of Sanjaya in
using these names is to remind Dhritarâshtra—who may naturally be a
little elated at the prospect of Arjuna's not fighting —that this is
only a temporary weakness, since by the presence of the Lord of the
senses all ignorance must eventually be dispelled. Arjuna's own nature
also is devoid of darkness. Is he not the conqueror of sleep, and the
terror of foes?

<span id="fn_21"></span>[34:10](sbg07.htm#fr_21.md) *Smiling*—to drown
Arjuna in the ocean of shame. Krishna's smile at Arjuna's sorrow is like
the lightning that plays over the black monsoon cloud. The rain bursts
forth, and the thirsty earth is saturated. It is the smile of the coming
illumination.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[34:11](sbg07.htm#fr_22.md) *Words of wisdom:* Vide
I. 35-44.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[35:12](sbg07.htm#fr_23.md) Of course Krishna here
does not mean that the body is immortal, but refers to the true Self,
behind all bodies.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[36:13](sbg07.htm#fr_24.md) According to this, the
continuity of the ego is no more interrupted by death than by the
passing of childhood into youth and youth into old age in this body.

*Calm souls:* Those who have become calm by Self-realisation.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[36:14](sbg07.htm#fr_25.md) *They have a beginning
and an end:* as distinguished from the Permanent Self. The more one is
able to identify oneself with the Permanent <span id="page_37">p.
37</span> Self, the less one is affected by the agreeable and
disagreeable conditions of life.

*Impermanent in their nature:* That is, the same object which gives
pleasure at one moment gives pain at another, and so on.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[37:15](sbg07.htm#fr_26.md) Thus perfect sameness
amidst the ills of life means full and unbroken consciousness of our
oneness with the Immortal Self. Thus is immortality attained.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[38:16](sbg07.htm#fr_27.md) *Unreal:* *Real:* The
determination of the nature of the Real is the quest of all philosophy.
Sri Krishna here states that a thing which never remains the same for
any given period is unreal, and that the Real on the other hand is
always the same. The whole of the phenomenal world, therefore, must be
unreal, because in it no one state endures for even an infinitesimal
division of time. And that which takes note of this incessant change,
and is therefore itself changeless,—the Atman, Consciousness,—is the
Real.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[38:17](sbg07.htm#fr_28.md) <span id="page_39">p.
39</span> *That by which all this is pervaded*, *i.e.* He that pervades
all this as the Witness.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[39:18](sbg07.htm#fr_29.md) Arjuna's grief which
deters him from his duty of fighting against the Kauravas is born of
ignorance as to the true nature of the Soul. Hence Sri Bhagavân's strong
and repeated attempts to illumine him on the subject.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[40:19](sbg07.htm#fr_30.md) Cf. Katha Up. I. ii.
19-20.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[40:20](sbg07.htm#fr_31.md) <span id="page_41">p.
41</span> This sloka refers in the sense of denial to the six kinds of
modification inherent in matter: birth, subsistence, growth,
transformation, decay, and death.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[41:21](sbg07.htm#fr_32.md) *How is he to
slay?*—referring to Arjuna. *To cause another to slay*—referring to
Krishna's own part.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[42:22](sbg07.htm#fr_33.md) As one only puts off
the old, when one already possesses the new garment, so the embodied is
already entering a new body in the act of leaving this. The Upanishad
compares this to the movement of a leech, which has already established
a new foothold before leaving the old.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[43:25](sbg07.htm#fr_34.md) This Self is infinite
and partless, so can be neither subject nor object of any action.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[44:26](sbg07.htm#fr_35.md) Krishna here, for the
sake of argument, takes up the materialistic supposition, and shows that
even if the Self were impermanent, sorrow ought to be destroyed, since
in that case there would be no hereafter, no sin, and no hell.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[44:27](sbg07.htm#fr_36.md) This sloka concerns
only those who are not yet free. So long as there is desire, birth and
death are inevitable.

*Therefore thou oughtest not to grieve:* Since you cannot control the
inevitable and preserve the bodies of your relations, work out your own
Karma and go beyond both birth and death.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[45:28](sbg07.htm#fr_37.md) *Beings:* In their
relationships as sons and friends, who are mere combinations of material
elements, correlated as causes and effects.

The idea here is that that which has no existence in the beginning and
in the end, must be merely illusory in the interim, and should not
therefore be allowed to have any influence upon the mind.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[46:29](sbg07.htm#fr_38.md) The sloka may also be
interpreted in the sense that those who see, hear and speak of the Self
are wonderful men, because their number is so small. It is not therefore
remarkable that you should mourn, because the Atman is so difficult to
comprehend.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[47:30](sbg07.htm#fr_39.md) Krishna here returns to
His own point of view.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[47:31](sbg07.htm#fr_40.md) That is to say, it is
the duty of a Kshatriya to fight in the interest of his country, people
and religion.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[48:32](sbg07.htm#fr_41.md) The Shâstras say that
if a Kshatriya fighting for a righteous cause falls in the battle-field,
he at once go to heaven.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[49:34](sbg07.htm#fr_42.md) The present
argument,—slokas 33-36, assumes that the cause in hand is already proved
to be right. Hence it could only be from cowardice that Arjuna could
abandon it. Even a hero may be weakened by the stirring of his deepest
emotions.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[49:\*](sbg07.htm#fr_43.md) Vide commentary I. 6.

<span id="fn_44"></span>[51:38](sbg07.htm#fr_44.md) It is always the desire
for one of the pairs of opposites that binds. When an act is done
without attachment either for itself or its fruit, then Karma can be
worked out without adding to its store, and this leads to Freedom.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[51:39](sbg07.htm#fr_45.md) *Yoga:*—Karma Yoga, or
that plan of conduct which secures the working out of past Karma;
non-accumulation of new; and the striving for Self-realisation with the
whole of the will. In this discipline, one's sole object in life is
Self-realisation; hence no importance is attached to anything else. Thus
all actions are performed without attachment, <span id="page_52">p.
52</span> or care for results. So no new Karma is made: only the already
accumulated is exhausted. And at the same time, the whole will is left
free to devote itself to the achievement of Self-realisation alone.

In the preceding slokas, 11-25, Krishna has given the point of view of
the highest knowledge, the ancient Brahmajnâna. In the 25th and 27th we
have a purely materialistic standpoint. Slokas 28 to 37 give the
attitude of a man of the world. In the 38th we have an anticipation of
the Yoga. And in what is to follow, we have Sri Krishna's own
contribution to the philosophy of life.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[52:52](sbg07.htm#fr_46.md) *Waste of the
unfinished attempt:* A religious rite or ceremony performed for a
definite object, if left uncompleted, is wasted, like a house unroofed
which is neither serviceable nor enduring. In Karma Yoga, however, that
is, action and worship performed <span id="page_53">p. 53</span> without
desire, this law does not apply, for every effort results in immediate
purification of the heart. *Production of contrary results:* In worship
for an object, any imperfection in the process produces positive loss
instead of gain. As in cases of sickness, the non-use of the right
medicine results in death. *The great terror:* Being caught in the wheel
of birth and death.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[53:53](sbg07.htm#fr_47.md) In Karma Yoga, the one
goal is Self-realisation. *The undecided* (that is, about the highest),
naturally devote themselves to lower ideals, no one of which can
satisfy. Thus they pass from plan to plan.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[55:42](sbg07.htm#fr_48.md) Samâdhi has been
rendered into 'mind' in the above. The generally accepted significance
of the term (absorption in God-consciousness produced by deep
meditation) would give an equally consistent and happy meaning: Persons
attached to pleasure and power cannot have perfect steadiness of mind in
divine meditation.

*Panegyric words of the Vedas:* The Karma Kânda or the sacrificial
portion of the Vedas which lays down specific rules for specific actions
and their fruits, and extols these latter unduly. *Nothing else:* Beyond
the heavenly enjoyments procurable by the sacrificial rites of the
Vedas.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[55:45](sbg07.htm#fr_49.md) *The Vedas deal with
etc.:* That is to say, the Vedas treat of relativity. *Pairs of
opposites:* Dvandva, all correlated ideas and sensations, *e.g.*, good
and bad, pleasure and pain, heat and cold, light and darkness, etc.

*Guna* is a technical term of the Sânkhya philosophy: also used in the
same sense by the Vedânta. Prakriti or Nature is constituted of three
Gunas; Sattva (equilibrium), Rajas (attraction), Tamas (inertia).
Prakriti *is* the three Gunas, *not* that she *has* them. Guna is
wrongly translated as quality; it is substance as well as quality,
matter *and* force. Wherever there is name and form, there is Guna. Guna
also means a rope, that which binds.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[56:46](sbg07.htm#fr_50.md) A man possessed of
Self-knowledge has no need whatever of the Vedas. This does not,
however, mean that the Vedas are useless; only to the knower of Brahman
they have no value, as the transient <span id="page_57">p. 57</span>
pleasures derivable from them are comprehended in the infinite bliss of
Self-knowledge.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[57:47](sbg07.htm#fr_51.md) *Be thou not the
producer, etc.:* That is, do not work with any desire for results, for
actions produce fruits or bondage only if they are performed with
desire.

Karma primarily means action, but a much profounder meaning has come to
be attached to this word. It means the destiny forged by one in one's
past incarnation or present: the store of tendencies, impulses,
characteristics, and habits laid by, which determines the future
embodiment, environment and the whole of one's organisation.

Another meaning of Karma often used in reference to one's caste or
position in life, is duty, the course of conduct which one ought to
follow in pursuance of the tendencies which one acquired in <span
id="page_58">p. 58</span> one's past, with a view to work them out and
regain the pristine purity of the Self.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[59:50](sbg07.htm#fr_52.md) *Alike from vice and
virtue:* A follower of Karma Yoga can have no personal motive for any
action. Our action without motive becomes colourless, loses its
character of vice or virtue.

*Dexterity of work:* It is the nature of work to produce bondage. Karma
Yoga is the dexterity of work because it not only robs work of its power
to bind, but also transforms it into an efficient means of freedom.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[60:52](sbg07.htm#fr_53.md) *The taint of
illusion:* the identifying of the Self with the non-Self, the ego.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[61:54](sbg07.htm#fr_54) Arjuna is asking, (1.md)
what is the state of the mind of the man of realisation when in Samâdhi?
and (2) how is its influence shown in his conduct when out of it? <span
id="page_62">p. 62</span>

*Steady wisdom:* Settled conviction of one's identity with Brahman
gained by direct realisation.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[62:55](sbg07.htm#fr_55.md) This answers the first
part of Arjuna's question.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[63:63](sbg07.htm#fr_56.md) This and the following
two slokas answer the second part of Arjuna's question, as to the
conduct of one of perfect realisation.

*Muni:* Man of meditation.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[63:57](sbg07.htm#fr_57.md) *Not pleased etc.:*
consequently he does not praise or blame. This is an answer to the
query: "How does he speak?"

<span id="fn_58"></span>[64:58](sbg07.htm#fr_58.md) *Withdraw the senses:*
bring the mind back upon the Self from all sense-objects. This is known
as Pratyâhâra in Yoga.

To explain the sloka more fully: a man of the highest realisation can,
at any moment, shake himself clear of all impressions of the sense-world
and go into Samâdhi, with the ease and naturalness of a tortoise drawing
its limbs within itself.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[64:59](sbg07.htm#fr_59.md) *Abstinent man:* An
unillumined person abstaining from sense-pleasure for penance, or
because of physical incapacity.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[66:63](sbg07.htm#fr_60.md) A beautiful image
appears. The tendency of the mind is to repeat it. Then, if the image is
allowed to recur, a liking grows. With the growth of liking the wish to
come close, to possess, appears. Any obstacle to this produces wrath.
The impulse of anger throws the mind into confusion, which casts a veil
over the lessons of wisdom learnt by past experience. Thus deprived of
his moral standard, he is prevented from using his discrimination.
Failing in discrimination, he acts irrationally, on the impulse of
passion, and paves the way to moral death.

Thus Krishna traces moral degradation to those <span id="page_67">p.
67</span> first breaths of thought, that come softly and almost
unconsciously to the mind.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[67:64](sbg07.htm#fr_61.md) The above is in answer
to Arjuna's fourth question, "How does he move?"

<span id="fn_62"></span>[67:65](sbg07.htm#fr_62.md) That is, firmly
concentrates itself on the Self.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[69:68](sbg07.htm#fr_63.md) This does not mean that
the senses remain completely estranged, but that they are all
estrange-able at will.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[69:69](sbg07.htm#fr_64.md) Where all beings are in
darkness, there the Muni sees, and *vice versa*. The consciousness of
the man of realisation is so full of God that he cannot see anything
apart from Him. The ignorant man, on the other hand, lives in the world
of plurality alone and God is a nonentity to him. <span id="page_70">p.
70</span>

It follows, that non-susceptibility to the influences of Nature, that
is, perfect self-control (spoken of in the preceding sloka) is quite as
natural a trait of the illumined soul as its opposite is of the
ignorant.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[70:70](sbg07.htm#fr_65.md) The ocean is not at all
affected by the waters flowing into it from all sides. Similarly, that
man alone finds true peace in whom no reaction of desire is produced by
the objects of enjoyment, which he happens to come across during his
sojourn on earth.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[71:71](sbg07.htm#fr_66.md) The man who
lives,—merely to work out his past Karma.
