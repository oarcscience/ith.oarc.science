### TENTH CHAPTER

The Blessed Lord said:

1\. Again, O mighty-armed, do thou listen to My supreme word, which I,
wishing thy welfare, will tell thee who art delighted (to hear
Me). <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_223.md)

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

2\. Neither the hosts of Devas, nor the great Rishis, know My origin,
for in every way I am the source of all the Devas and the great
Rishis. <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_224.md)

3\. He who knows Me, birthless and beginningless, the great Lord of
worlds—he, among mortals, is undeluded, he is freed from all sins. <span
id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_225.md)

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

4-5. Intellect, knowledge, non-delusion, forbearance, truth, restraint
of the external senses, calmness of heart, happiness, misery, birth,
death, fear, as well as fearlessness, non-injury, evenness, contentment,
austerity, benevolence, good name, (as well as) ill-fame;—(these)
different kinds of qualities of beings arise from Me alone. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[4](#fn_226.md)

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

6\. The seven great Rishis as well as the four ancient Manus, possessed
of powers like Me (due to their thoughts being fixed on Me), were born
of (My) mind; from them are these creatures in the world. <span
id="fr_227"></span>[6](#fn_227.md)

7\. He who in reality knows these manifold manifestations of My being
and (this) Yoga power of Mine, becomes established in the unshakable
Yoga; there is no doubt about it. <span id="fr_228"></span>[7](#fn_228.md)

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

8\. l am the origin of all, from Me everything evolves;—thus thinking
the wise worship Me with loving consciousness. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[8](#fn_229.md)

9\. With their minds wholly in Me, with their senses absorbed in Me,
enlightening one another, and always speaking of Me, they are satisfied
and delighted. <span id="fr_230"></span>[9](#fn_230.md)

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

10\. To them, ever steadfast and serving Me with affection, I give that
Buddhi Yoga by which they come unto Me. <span
id="fr_231"></span>[10](#fn_231.md)

11\. Out of mere compassion for them,

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I, abiding in
their hearts, destroy the darkness (in them) born of ignorance, by the
luminous lamp of knowledge. <span id="fr_232"></span>[11](#fn_232.md)

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

Arjuna said:

12-13. The Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Abode, the Supreme Purifier, art
Thou. All the Rishis, the Deva-Rishi Nârada as well as Asita, Devala and
Vyâsa have declared Thee as the Eternal, the Self-luminous Purusha, the
first Deva, Birth-less and All-pervading. So also Thou Thyself sayest to
me.

14\. I regard all this that Thou sayest to me as true, O Keshava.
Verily, O Bhagavân, neither the Devas nor the Dânavas know Thy
manifestation. <span id="fr_233"></span>[14](#fn_233.md)

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

15\. Verily, Thou Thyself knowest Thyself by Thyself, O Purusha Supreme,
O Source of beings, O Lord of beings, O Deva of Devas, O Ruler of the
world.

16\. Thou shouldst indeed speak, without reserve, of Thy divine
attributes by which, filling all these worlds, Thou existest. <span
id="fr_234"></span>[16](#fn_234.md)

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

17\. How shall I, O Yogin, meditate ever to know Thee? In what things,
Bhagavân, art Thou to be thought of by me? <span
id="fr_235"></span>[17](#fn_235.md)

18\. Speak to me again in detail, Jnanârdana, of Thy Yoga-powers and
attributes; for I am never satiated in hearing the ambrosia (of Thy
speech). <span id="fr_236"></span>[18](#fn_236.md)

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

19\. I shall speak to thee now, O best of the Kurus, of My divine
attributes, according to their prominence; there is no end to the
particulars of My manifestation. <span id="fr_237"></span>[19](#fn_237.md)

20\. I am the Self, O Gudâkesha, existent in the heart of all beings; I
am the

25\. Of the great Rishis I am Bhrigu; of words I am the one syllable
"Om"; of Yajnas I am the Yajna of Japa (silent repetition); of immovable
things the Himâlaya. <span id="fr_239"></span>[25](#fn_239.md)

26\. Of all trees (I am) the Ashvattha, and Nârada of Deva-Rishis;
Chitraratha of Gandharvas am I, and the Muni Kapila of the perfected
ones.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

Kandarpa, the cause of offspring; of serpents I am Vâsuki.

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

of Pitris I am, I am Yama of controllers.

30\. And Prahlâda am I of Diti's progeny, of measurers I am Time; and of

of warriors am I; of fishes I am the shark, of streams I am Jâhnavi (the

32\. Of manifestations I, am the beginning, the middle and also the end;

disputants. <span id="fr_241"></span>[32](#fn_241.md)

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

33\. Of letters the letter A am I, and Dvandva of all compounds; I alone
am the inexhaustible Time, I the Sustainer (by dispensing fruits of
actions) All-formed. <span id="fr_242"></span>[33](#fn_242.md)

34\. And I am the all-seizing Death, and the prosperity of those who are
to be prosperous; of the feminine qualities (I am) Fame, Prosperity (or

There is no being, whether moving or unmoving, that can exist without
Me.

40\. There is no end of My divine attributes, O scorcher of foes; but
this is a brief statement by Me of the particulars of My divine
attributes.

41\. Whatever being there is great,

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

prosperous or powerful, that know thou to be a product of a part of My
splendour.

42\. Or what avails thee to know all this diversity, O Arjuna? (Know
thou this,. that) I exist, supporting this whole world by a portion of
Myself.

is classified under three heads: 1. Vâda; 2. Vitandâ; 3. Jalpa.

In the first, the object is to arrive at truth; in the second, idle
carping at the arguments of another, without trying to establish the
opposite side of the question; and in the third, the assertion of one's
own opinion, and the attempt to refute that of the adversary by
overbearing reply or wrangling rejoinder.
