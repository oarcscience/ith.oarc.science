### ELEVENTH CHAPTER

Arjuna said:

1\. By the supremely profound words, on the discrimination of Self, that
have been spoken by Thee out of compassion towards me, this my delusion
is gone.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

2\. Of Thee, O lotus-eyed, I have heard at length, of the origin and
dissolution of beings, as also Thy inexhaustible greatness.

3\. So it is, O Lord Supreme! as Thou hast declared Thyself. (Still) I
desire to see Thy Ishvara-Form, O Purusha Supreme. <span
id="fr_245"></span>[3](#fn_245.md)

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

4\. If, O Lord, Thou thinkest me capable of seeing it, then, O Lord of
Yogis, show me Thy immutable Self.

The Blessed Lord said:

5\. Behold, O son of Prithâ, by hundreds and thousands, My different
forms celestial, of various colours and shapes.

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

6\. Behold the Adityas, the Vasus, the Rudras, the twin Ashvins, and the
Maruts; behold, O descendant of Bharata, many wonders never seen before.

7\. See now, O Gudâkesha, in this My body, the whole universe centred in
one,—including the moving and the unmoving,—and all else that thou
desirest to see. <span id="fr_246"></span>[7](#fn_246.md)

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

8\. But thou canst not see Me with these eyes of thine; I give thee
supersensuous sight; behold My Yoga Power Supreme. <span
id="fr_247"></span>[8](#fn_247.md)

Sanjaya said:

9\. Having thus spoken, O King, Hari, the Great Lord of Yoga, showed
unto the son of Prithâ, His Supreme Ishvara-Form—

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

10\. With numerous mouths and eyes, with numerous wondrous sights, with
numerous celestial ornaments, with numerous celestial weapons uplifted;

11\. Wearing celestial garlands and apparel, anointed with
celestial-scented unguents, the All-wonderful, Resplendent, Boundless
and All-formed.

12\. If the splendour of a thousand suns were to rise up at once in the
sky, that would be like the splendour of that Mighty Being. <span
id="fr_248"></span>[12](#fn_248.md)

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

13\. There in the body of the God of gods, the son of Pându then saw the
whole universe resting in one, with its manifold divisions.

14\. Then Dhananjaya, filled with wonder, with his hair standing on end,
bending down his head to the Deva in adoration, spoke with joined
palms. <span id="fr_249"></span>[14](#fn_249.md)

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

Arjuna said:

15\. I see all the Devas, O Deva, in Thy body, and hosts of all grades
of beings; Brahma, the Lord, seated on the lotus, and all the Rishis and
celestial serpents.

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

16\. I see Thee of boundless form on every side with manifold arms,
stomachs, mouths and eyes; neither the end nor the middle, nor also the
beginning of Thee do I see, O Lord of the universe, O Universal Form.

17\. I see Thee with diadem, club, and discus; a mass of radiance
shining everywhere, very hard to look at, all around blazing like
burning fire and sun, and immeasurable.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

18\. Thou art the Imperishable, the Supreme Being, the one thing to be
known. Thou art the great Refuge of this universe;. Thou art the undying
Guardian of the Eternal Dharma, Thou art the Ancient. Purusha, I ween.

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

19\. I see Thee without beginning, middle or end, infinite in power, of
manifold arms; the sun and the moon Thine eyes, the burning fire Thy
mouth; heating the whole universe with Thy radiance.

20\. The space betwixt heaven and earth and all the quarters are filled
by Thee alone; having seen this, Thy marvellous and awful Form, the
three worlds are trembling with fear, O Great-souled One.

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

21\. Verily, into Thee enter these hosts of Devas; some extol Thee in
fear with joined palms; "May it be well!" thus saying, bands of great
Rishis and Siddhas praise Thee with splendid hymns.

22\. The Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sâdhyas, Vishva-Devas, the two Ashvins,
Maruts, Ushmapâs, and hosts of Gandharvas, Yakshas, Asuras, and
Siddhas,—all

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

these are looking at Thee, all quite astounded. <span
id="fr_250"></span>[22](#fn_250.md)

23\. Having seen Thy immeasurable Form—with many mouths and eyes, O
mighty-armed, with many arms, thighs and feet, with many stomachs, and
fearful with many tusks,—the worlds are terrified, and so am I.

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

24\. On seeing Thee touching the sky, shining in many a colour, with
mouths wide open, with large fiery eyes, I am terrified at heart, and
find no courage nor peace, O Vishnu.

25\. Having seen Thy mouths, fearful with tusks, (blazing) like
Pralaya-fires, I know not the four quarters, nor do I find peace; have
mercy, O Lord of the Devas, O Abode of the universe. <span
id="fr_251"></span>[25](#fn_251.md)

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

26-27. All these sons of Dhritarâshtra, with hosts of monarchs, Bhishma,
Drona,

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

and Sutaputra, with the warrior chiefs of ours, enter precipitately into
Thy mouth, terrible with tusks and fearful to behold. Some are found
sticking in the interstices of Thy teeth, with their heads crushed to
powder. <span id="fr_252"></span>[26](#fn_252.md)

28\. Verily, as the many torrents of rivers flow towards the ocean, so
do these heroes in the world of men enter Thy fiercely flaming
mouths.<span class="small">[28](#fn_253.md)</span>

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

29\. As moths precipitately rush into a blazing fire only to perish,
even so do these creatures also precipitately rush into Thy mouths only
to perish. <span id="fr_253"></span>[28](#fn_253.md)

30\. Swallowing all the worlds on every side with Thy flaming mouths,
Thou are licking Thy lips. Thy fierce rays, filling

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

the whole world with radiance, are burning, O Vishnu! <span
id="fr_254"></span>[30](#fn_254.md)

31\. Tell me who Thou art, fierce in form. Salutation to Thee, O Deva
Supreme; have mercy. I desire to know Thee, O Primeval One. I know not
indeed Thy purpose.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

32\. I am the mighty world-destroying Time, here made manifest for the
purpose of infolding the world. Even without thee, none of the warriors
arrayed in the hostile armies shall live. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[32](#fn_255.md)

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

33\. Therefore do thou arise and acquire fame. Conquer the enemies, and
enjoy the unrivalled dominion. Verily by Myself have they been already
slain; be thou merely an apparent cause, O Savyasâchin (Arjuna). <span
id="fr_256"></span>[33](#fn_256.md)

34\. Drona, Bhishma, Jayadratha, Karna, as well as other brave
warriors,—

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

these already killed by Me, do thou kill. Be not distressed with fear;
fight, and thou shalt conquer thy enemies in battle. <span
id="fr_257"></span>[34](#fn_257.md)

Sanjaya said:

35\. Having, heard that speech of Keshava, the diademed one (Arjuna),
with joined palms, trembling, prostrated himself, and again addressed
Krishna in a

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

choked voice, bowing down, overwhelmed with fear.

Arjuna said:

36\. It is meet, O Hrishikesha, that the world is delighted and rejoices
in Thy praise, that Râkshasas fly in fear to all quarters and all the
hosts of Siddhas bow down to Thee in adoration.

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

37\. And why should they not, O Great-souled One, bow to Thee, greater
than, and the Primal Cause of even Brahmâ, O Infinite Being, O Lord of
the Devas, O Abode of the universe? Thou art the Imperishable, the Being
and the non-Being, (as well as) That which is Beyond (them). <span
id="fr_258"></span>[37](#fn_258.md)

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

38\. Thou art the Primal Deva, the Ancient Purusha; Thou art the Supreme
Refuge of this universe, Thou art the Knower, and the One Thing to be
known; Thou art the Supreme Goal. By Thee is the universe pervaded, O
Boundless Form.

39\. Thou art Vâyu, Yama, Agni, Varuna, the Moon, Prajâpati, and the
Great-Grandfather. Salutation, salutation

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

to Thee, a thousand times, and again and again salutation, salutation to
Thee! <span id="fr_259"></span>[39](#fn_259.md)

40\. Salutation to Thee before and behind, salutation to Thee on every
side, O All! Thou, infinite in power and infinite in prowess, pervadest
all; wherefore Thou art All. <span id="fr_260"></span>[40](#fn_260.md)

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

41-42. Whatever I have presumptuously said from carelessness or love,
addressing Thee as, "O Krishna, O Yâdava, O friend," regarding Thee
merely as a friend, unconscious of this Thy greatness—in whatever way I
may have been disrespectful to Thee in fun, while walking, reposing,
sitting, or at meals, when alone (with Thee), O Achyuta, or in company—

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I implore Thee,
Immeasurable One, to forgive all this. <span
id="fr_261"></span>[41](#fn_261.md)

43\. Thou art the Father of the world, moving and unmoving; the object
of its worship; greater than the great. None there exists who is equal
to Thee in the three worlds; who then can excel Thee, O. Thou of power
incomparable? <span id="fr_262"></span>[43](#fn_262.md)

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

44\. So prostrating my body in adoration, I crave Thy forgiveness, Lord
adorable! As a father forgiveth his son, friend a dear friend, a beloved
one his love, even so shouldst Thou forgive me, O Deva.

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

45\. Overjoyed am I to have seen what I saw never before; yet my mind is
distracted with terror. Show me, O Deva, only that Form of Thine. Have
mercy, O Lord of Devas, O Abode of the universe.

46\. Diademed, bearing a mace and a discus, Thee I desire to see as
before. Assume that same four-armed Form, O Thou of thousand arms, of
universal Form.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

47\. Graciously have I shown to thee, O Arjuna, this Form supreme, by My
own Yoga power, this resplendent, primeval, infinite, universal Form of
Mine, which hath not been seen before by anyone else.

48\. Neither by the study of the Veda and Yajna, nor by gifts, nor by
rituals,

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

nor by severe austerities, am I in such Form seen, in the world of men,
by any other than thee, O great hero of the Kurus.

49\. Be not afraid nor bewildered, having beheld this Form of Mine, so
terrific. With thy fears dispelled and with gladdened heart, now see
again this (former) form of Mine.

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

Sanjaya said:

50\. So Vâsudeva, having thus spoken to Arjuna, showed again His own
Form and the Great-souled One, assuming His gentle Form, pacified him
who was terrified.

Arjuna said:

51\. Having seen this Thy gentle human Form, O Janârdana, my thoughts
are now composed and I am restored to my nature.

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

52\. Very hard indeed it is to see this Form of Mine which thou hast
seen. Even the Devas ever long to behold this Form.

53\. Neither by the Vedas, nor by austerity, nor by gifts, nor by
sacrifice can I be seen as thou hast seen Me.

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

54\. But by the single-minded devotion I may in this Form, be known, O
Arjuna, and seen in reality, and also entered into, O scorcher of
foes. <span id="fr_263"></span>[54](#fn_263.md)

55\. He who does work for Me alone and has Me for his goal, is devoted
to Me, is freed from attachment, and bears enmity towards no creature—he
entereth into Me, O Pândava. <span id="fr_264"></span>[55](#fn_264.md)

*I know . . . quarters:* I cannot distinguish the East from the West,
nor the North from the South.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[256:26](sbg16.htm#fr_252.md) *Sutaputra:* The son
of a charioteer, Kama.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[257:28](sbg16.htm#fr_253.md) 28 & 29.—The two
similes vividly illustrate how the assembled warriors rush to
destruction, out of their uncontrollable nature, with or without
discrimination.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[258:30](sbg16.htm#fr_254.md) *Licking Thy lips:*
consuming entirely, enjoying it, as it were.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[259:32](sbg16.htm#fr_255.md) *Even without thee
&c*.—Even without thy instrumentality, *i.e.*, even if thou, O Arjuna,
wouldst not fight, the end of all these warriors is inevitable, because
I as the all-destroying Time have already killed them; so thy
instrumentality in that work is insignificant.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[260:33](sbg16.htm#fr_256.md) *Be thou . . .
cause*.—People will think thee as the vanquisher of thy enemies, whom
even the Devas cannot kill, and thus thou wilt gain glory; but thou art
only an instrument in My hand.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[261:34](sbg16.htm#fr_257.md) *Already killed by

Hiranyagarbha.

*The Being and the non-Being, &c.*—The Sat (manifested) and the Asat
(unmanifested), which form the Upâdhis (adjuncts) of the Akshara
(Imperishable); as such He is spoken of as the Sat and the Asat. In
reality, the Imperishable transcends the Sat and the Asat.

The God of wind, death, fire, waters, and the moon.

born of affection.

*In company:* in the presence of others.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[267:43](sbg16.htm#fr_262.md) *None . . . to
Thee*—There cannot be two or more Ishvaras; if there were, the world
could not get on as it does. When one Ishvara desires to create, another
may desire to [destroy](errata.htm#1.md). Who knows that all the different
Ishvaras would be of one mind, as they would all be independent of each
other?

<span id="fn_263"></span>[274:54](sbg16.htm#fr_263.md) *Single-minded
devotion:* That devotion which never seeks any other object but the Lord
alone, and consequently cognises no other object but the Lord.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[274:55](sbg16.htm#fr_264.md) *Does work for Me
alone:* Serves Me alone in all forms and manner of ways, with his whole
heart and soul, and thus does not become attached to them.

He alone, whose devotion takes the forms as described in this sloka, can
know and realise Him as He is in reality, and subsequently become one
with Him.
