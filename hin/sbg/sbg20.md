### FIFTEENTH CHAPTER

The Blessed Lord said:

1\. They speak of an eternal Ashvattha rooted above and branching below,
whose leaves are the Vedas; he who knows it, is a Veda-knower. <span
id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_317)

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

2\. Below and above spread its branches, nourished by the Gunas;
sense-objects are its buds; and below in the world of man stretch forth
the roots, [originating](errata.htm#2) action. <span
id="fr_318"></span>[2](#fn_318)

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

3-4. Its form is not here perceived as such, neither its end, nor its
origin, nor its

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

existence. Having cut asunder this firm-rooted Ashvattha with the strong
axe of non-attachment,—then that Goal is to be sought for, going whither
they (the wise) do not return again. I seek refuge in that Primeval
Purusha whence streamed forth the Eternal Activity. <span
id="fr_319"></span>[3](#fn_319)

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

5\. Free from pride and delusion, with the evil of attachment conquered,
ever dwelling in the Self, with desires completely receded, liberated
from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, the undeluded
reach that Goal Eternal.

6\. That the sun illumines not, nor the moon, nor fire; that is My
Supreme Abode, going whither they return not.

7\. An eternal portion of Myself having become a living soul in the
world of life, draws (to itself) the (five) senses

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

with mind for the sixth, abiding in Prakriti. <span
id="fr_320"></span>[7](#fn_320)

8\. When the Lord obtains a body and when He leaves it, He takes these
and goes, as the wind takes the scents from their seats (the
flowers). <span id="fr_321"></span>[8](#fn_321)

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

9\. Presiding over the ear, the eye, the touch, the taste and the smell,
as also the mind, He experiences objects.

10\. Him while transmigrating from one body to another, or residing (in
the same) or experiencing, or when united with the Gunas,—the deluded do
not see; but those who have the eye of wisdom behold Him. <span
id="fr_322"></span>[10](#fn_322)

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

11\. The Yogis striving (for perfection) behold Him dwelling in
themselves; but the unrefined and unintelligent, even though striving,
see Him not. <span id="fr_323"></span>[11](#fn_323)

12\. The light which, residing in the sun illumines the whole world,
that which is in the moon and in the fire—know that light to be
Mine. <span id="fr_324"></span>[12](#fn_324)

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

13\. Entering the earth with My energy, I support all beings, and I
nourish all the herbs, becoming the watery moon. <span
id="fr_325"></span>[13](#fn_325)

14\. Abiding in the body of living beings as (the fire) Vaishvânara, I,
associated with Prâna and Apâna, digest the fourfold food. <span
id="fr_326"></span>[14](#fn_326)

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

15\. I am centred in the hearts of all; memory and perception as well as
their loss come from Me. I am verily that which has to be known by all
the Vedas, I indeed am the Author of the Vedânta, and the Knower of the
Veda am I. <span id="fr_327"></span>[15](#fn_327)

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

16\. There are two Purushas in the world,—the Perishable and the
Imperishable. All beings are the Perishable; and the Kutastha is called
Imperishable. <span id="fr_328"></span>[16](#fn_328)

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

17\. But (there is) another, the Supreme Purusha, called the Highest
Self, the immutable Lord, who pervading the three worlds, sustains
them. <span id="fr_329"></span>[17](#fn_329)

18\. As I transcend the Perishable and am above even the Imperishable,
therefore am I in the world and in the Veda celebrated as the
Purushottama, (the Highest Purusha). <span
id="fr_330"></span>[18](#fn_330)

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

19\. He who free from delusion thus knows Me, the Highest Spirit, he
knowing all, worships Me with all his heart, O descendant of Bharata.

20\. Thus, O sinless one, has this most profound teaching been imparted
by Me. Knowing this one attains the highest intelligence

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

and will have accomplished all one's duties, O descendant of
Bharata. <span id="fr_331"></span>[20](#fn_331)

Way to the Supreme Spirit</span>.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_317"></span>[323:1](sbg20.htm#fr_317) *Ashvattha:*
literally, that which does not endure till to-morrow: the Samsâra, the
ever-changing, phenomenal world.

Brahman with Its unmanifested energy Mâyâ, is spoken of as the One
"above," for It is supreme over all things; the One above is the root of
this Tree of Samsâra, as such it is said to have its root above. Mahat,
Ahamkâra Tanmâtrâs, etc., are its branches <span id="page_342">p.
342</span> evolving to grosser and grosser states—hence it is said to be
branching "*below*." As leaves protect a tree, so do the Vedas protect
the Tree of Samsâra, as treating of Dharma and Adharma, with their
causes and fruits.

*Eternal*—because this Tree of Samsâra rests on a continuous series of
births without beginning and end, and it cannot be cut down except by
the knowledge, "I am Brahman."

<span id="fn_318"></span>[324:2](sbg20.htm#fr_318) *Below:* from man
downwards.

*Above:* up to Brahmâ.

*Roots:* The tap-root is the Lord "above"; the <span id="page_325">p.
325</span> secondary roots are the Samskâras, attachment and aversion
etc. It is these that, being in perpetual succession the cause and
consequence of good and evil deeds, bind one fast to actions—Dharma and
Adharma.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[326:3](sbg20.htm#fr_319) *As such:* it cannot
be said to exist, because it appears and vanishes every other moment.
See commentary on II. 16.

*Tat*—That—Sankara and Anandagiri read 'Tatah,' and explain it as beyond
or above the Ashvattha, the Tree of Samsâra.

*The Eternal Activity:* this ever-passing work of projection, this
ever-flowing current of evolution, the world of phenomena.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[328:7](sbg20.htm#fr_320) The Jiva or the
individual soul is that aspect of the Supreme Self which manifests
itself in every one as the doer and enjoyer, being limited by the
Upâdhis set up by Avidyâ; but in reality, both are the same. It is like
the Akâsha (space) in the jar, which is a portion of the infinite
Akâsha, and becomes one with the latter on the destruction of the jar,
the cause of limitation.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[328:8](sbg20.htm#fr_321) *Lord:* Jiva spoken
of in the preceding Sloka.

When the Jiva leaves the body, then he draws round himself the senses
and the Manas. When he enters another he takes these again with him,
*i.e.*, he is born with these again.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[329:10](sbg20.htm#fr_322) Though Atman is
nearest and comes most easily within the range of their consciousness in
a variety of functions, still all do not see Him, because of their
complete subservience to sense-objects.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[330:11](sbg20.htm#fr_323) *The unrefined:*
Whose mind has not been regenerated by Tapas and subjugation of the
senses, whose mind is not purified.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[330:12](sbg20.htm#fr_324) *Light*—may also be
understood to mean the light of consciousness.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[331:13](sbg20.htm#fr_325) *Energy*—Ojas: The
energy of the Ishvara, whereby the vast heaven and the earth are firmly
held.

*Nourish*—by infusing sap into them.

*The watery moon:* The Soma, moon, is considered as the repository or
the embodiment of all fluids (Rasas.)

<span id="fn_326"></span>[331:14](sbg20.htm#fr_326) <span
id="page_331">p. 331</span> See IV. 29.

*Vaishvânara:* The fire abiding in the stomach.

*Fourfold food:* Food which has to be eaten by (1) mastication, (2)
sucking, (3) licking, and (4):swallowing.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[332:15](sbg20.htm#fr_327) *Memory*—of what is
experienced in the past births; and *knowledge*—of things transcending
the ordinary limits of space, time and visible nature.—*Anandagiri*.
<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

*Come from Me*—as the result of their good or evil deeds.

*I indeed . . . Vedânta:* It is I who am the Teacher of the wisdom of
the Vedanta, and cause it to be handed down in regular succession.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[333:16](sbg20.htm#fr_328) *Two Purushas:* Two
categories—arranged in, two separate groups of beings,—spoken of as:
'Purushas,' as they are the Upâdhis of the Purusha.

*Imperishable*—Mâyâ-Sakti of the Lord, the germ from which the
perishable being takes its birth.

*Kutastha:* That which manifests Itself in various forms of illusion and
deception. It is said to be imperishable, as the seed of Samsâra is
endless,—in the sense that it does not perish in the absence of
Brahma-Jnâna.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[334:17](sbg20.htm#fr_329) *Another:* quite
distinct from the two.

*The three Worlds:* Bhuh (the Earth), Bhuvah (the Mid-Region) and Svah
(the Heaven).

<span id="fn_330"></span>[334:18](sbg20.htm#fr_330) <span
id="page_335">p. 335</span> *The Perishable*—The Tree of Samsâra called
Ashvattha.

*The Imperishable*—Which constitutes the seed of the Tree of Samsâra.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[336:20](sbg20.htm#fr_331) *Highest
intelligence*—which realises the Brahman.

*Will have accomplished . . . duties:* Whatever duty one has to do in
life, all that duty has been done, when the Brahman is realised.
