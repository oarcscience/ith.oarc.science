### FIFTH CHAPTER

Arjuna said:

1\. Renunciation of action, O Krishna, thou commendest, and again, its
performance. Which is the better one of these? Do thou tell me
decisively. <span id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_117)

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

2\. Both renunciation and performance of action lead to freedom: of
these, performance of action is superior to the renunciation of
action. <span id="fr_118"></span>[2](#fn_118)

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

3\. He should be known a constant Sannyâsi, who neither likes nor
dislikes: for, free from the pairs of opposites, mighty-armed, he is
easily set free from bondage. <span id="fr_119"></span>[3](#fn_119)

4\. Children, not the wise, speak of knowledge and performance of
action, as distinct. He who truly lives in one, gains the fruits of
both. <span id="fr_120"></span>[4](#fn_120)

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

5\. The plane which is reached by the Jnânins is also reached by the
Karmayogins. Who sees knowledge and performance of action as one, he
sees.

6\. Renunciation of action, O mighty-armed, is hard to attain to without
performance of action; the man of meditation, purified by devotion to
action, quickly goes to Brahman. <span id="fr_121"></span>[6](#fn_121)

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

7\. With the mind purified by devotion to performance of action, and the
body conquered, and senses subdued, one who realises one's Self, as the
Self in all beings, though acting, is not tainted.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

8-9. The knower of Truth, (being) centred (in the Self) should think, "I
do nothing at all"—though seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating,
going, sleeping, breathing, speaking, letting go, holding, opening and
closing the eyes—convinced that it is the senses that move among
sense-objects.

10\. He who does actions forsaking attachment, resigning them to
Brahman, is not soiled by evil, like unto a lotus-leaf by water. <span
id="fr_122"></span>[10](#fn_122)

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

11\. Devotees in the path of work perform action, only with body, mind,
senses, and intellect, forsaking attachment, for the purification of the
heart. <span id="fr_123"></span>[11](#fn_123)

12\. The well-poised, forsaking the fruit of action, attains peace, born
of steadfastness; the unbalanced one, led by desire, is bound by being
attached to the fruit (of action). <span
id="fr_124"></span>[12](#fn_124)

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

13\. The subduer (of the senses), having renounced all actions by
discrimination, rests happily in the city of the nine gates, neither
acting, nor causing (others) to act. <span
id="fr_125"></span>[13](#fn_125)

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

14\. Neither agency, nor actions does the Lord create for the world, nor
(does He bring about) the union with the fruit of action. It is
universal ignorance that does. (it all).

15\. The Omnipresent takes note of the merit or demerit of none.
Knowledge is enveloped in ignorance, hence do beings get deluded. <span
id="fr_126"></span>[15](#fn_126)

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

16\. But whose ignorance is destroyed by the knowledge of Self,—that
knowledge of theirs, like the sun, reveals the Supreme (Brahman).

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

17\. Those who have their intellect absorbed in That, whose self is
That, whose steadfastness is in That, whose consummation is That, their
impurities cleansed by knowledge, they attain to Non-return (Moksha).

18\. The knowers of the Self look with an equal eye on a Brâhmana
endowed with learning and humility, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a
pariah. <span id="fr_127"></span>[18](#fn_127)

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

19\. (Relative) existence has been conquered by them, even in this
world, whose mind rests in evenness, since Brahman is even and without
imperfection: therefore they indeed rest in Brahman. <span
id="fr_128"></span>[19](#fn_128)

20\. Resting in Brahman, with intellect steady, and without delusion,
the knower of Brahman neither rejoiceth on receiving what is pleasant,
nor grieveth on receiving what is unpleasant.

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

21\. With the heart unattached to external objects, he realises the joy
that is in the Self. With the heart devoted to the meditation of
Brahman, he attains un-decaying happiness. <span
id="fr_129"></span>[21](#fn_129)

22\. Since enjoyments that are contact-born are parents of misery alone,
and with beginning and end, O son of Kunti, a wise man does not seek
pleasure in them.

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

23\. He who can withstand in this world, before the liberation from the
body, the impulse arising from lust and anger, he is steadfast (in
Yoga), he is a happy man.

24\. Whose happiness is within, whose relaxation is within, whose light
is within, that Yogi alone, becoming Brahman, gains absolute
freedom. <span id="fr_130"></span>[24](#fn_130)

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

25\. With imperfections exhausted, doubts dispelled, senses controlled,
engaged in the good of all beings, the Rishis obtain absolute
freedom. <span id="fr_131"></span>[25](#fn_131)

26\. Released from lust and anger, the heart controlled, the Self
realised, absolute freedom is for such Sannyâsis, both here and
hereafter.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

27-28. Shutting out external objects, steadying the eyes between the
eyebrows, restricting the even currents of Prâna and Apâna inside the
nostrils; the senses, mind, and intellect controlled, with Moksha as the
supreme goal, freed from desire, fear and anger: such a man of
meditation is verily free for ever. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[27](#fn_132)

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

29\. Knowing Me as the dispenser of Yajnas and asceticisms, as the Great
Lord of all worlds, as the friend of all beings, he attains Peace. <span
id="fr_133"></span>[29](#fn_133)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_117"></span>[120:1](sbg10.htm#fr_117) In IV. 18, 19, 21,
22, 24, 32, 33, 37 and 41, the Lord has spoken of the renunciation of
all actions; and in IV. 42 He has exhorted Arjuna to engage in Yoga, in
performance of action. Owing to the mutual opposition between the two,
which makes it impossible for one man to resort to both of them at the
same <span id="page_121">p. 121</span> time, doubt arises in the mind of
Arjuna, and hence the question as above.

*Its performance*—"Yoga" in the test: Yoga here and in the following
verses means Karma-Yoga.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[121:2](sbg10.htm#fr_118) *Performance of
action*—is superior to mere renunciation (*i.e.*, unaccompanied with
knowledge) in the case of the novice in the path of spirituality. See
the 6th sloka of this chapter.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[122:3](sbg10.htm#fr_119) *Constant Sannyâsi:*
he need not have taken Sannyâsa formally, but if he has the above frame
of mind, he is a Sannyâsi for ever and aye.

*Neither likes nor dislikes:* Neither hates pain and the objects causing
pain, nor desires pleasure and the objects causing pleasure, though
engaged in action.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[122:4](sbg10.htm#fr_120) Children: the
ignorant people devoid of insight into the purpose of the Shâstra.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[123:6](sbg10.htm#fr_121) It is not that
renunciation of action based on knowledge is not superior to performance
of action, <span id="page_124">p. 124</span> but that the latter method
is easier for a beginner, and qualifies him for the higher path, by
purifying his mind. Hence it is the proper, and therefore the superior
course, in his case.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[125:10](sbg10.htm#fr_122) *Evil:* the results,
good and bad, producing bondage.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[126:11](sbg10.htm#fr_123) *Only with
&c.*—without egotism or selfishness: it applies to body, mind, senses
and intellect.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[126:12](sbg10.htm#fr_124) *Born of
steadfastness:* Sankara explains Naisthikim as gradual perfection in the
path of knowledge, having the following stages of development: (1)
purity of heart, (2) gaining of <span id="page_127">p. 127</span>
knowledge, (3) renunciation of action, (4) steadiness in knowledge.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[127:13](sbg10.htm#fr_125) *All actions:* 1st,
Nitya, or obligatory—the performance of which does not produce any merit
while the non-performance produces demerit. 2nd, Naimittika, those
arising on the occurrence of some special events, as the birth of a son:
these also are customary. 3rd, Kâmya—those intended for securing some
special ends: these are only optional. 4th, Nishiddha—or forbidden. He
rests happily in the body (of nine organic openings), seeing inaction in
action: just exhausting his Prârabdha—not relating or identifying
himself with anything of the dual universe.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[128:15](sbg10.htm#fr_126) In unmistakable
words, Krishna describes the position of Iswara, or the Lord, in
relation to the Universe, in these two verses.

He is all-blissful, all-perfect; even the shadow of a motive or relation
in Him, would be contradictory <span id="page_129">p. 129</span> to His
nature. His mere proximity to Prakriti or Nature endues the latter with
power and potency of causing all that is. Jiva is bound so long as it,
relates itself to, and identifies itself with this Nature. When it
ceases to do so, it attains freedom. The whole teaching of the Gita, and
therefore of the whole Hindu Scripture, on this subject, is condensed in
the above.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[130:18](sbg10.htm#fr_127) Because they can see
nothing but the Self. It makes no difference to the sun whether it be
reflected in the Ganges, in wine, in a small pool, or in any unclean
liquid: the same is the case with the Self. No Upâdhi (or limiting
adjunct) can attach to it.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[131:19](sbg10.htm#fr_128) *Relative
existence:* All bondage as of birth, death etc. All possibility of
bondage is destroyed when the mind attains perfect evenness, which in
other words means—becoming Brahman.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[132:21](sbg10.htm#fr_129)
*Heart*—Antah-karana.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[133:24](sbg10.htm#fr_130) *Within:* In the
Self.

*Absolute Freedom:* Brahma-Nirvâna. He attains Moksha while still living
in the body.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[134:25](sbg10.htm#fr_131) Rishis: Men of right
vision and renunciation.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[135:27](sbg10.htm#fr_132) *External objects:*
Sound and other sense-objects. External objects are shut out from the
mind by not thinking of them. When the eyes are half-closed in
meditation, the eye-balls remain fixed, and their gaze converges, as it
were, between the eyebrows. Prâna is the out-going breath, Apâna the
in-coming; the restriction described is effected by Prânâyâma.

These two verses are the aphorisms of which the following chapter is the
commentary.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[136:29](sbg10.htm#fr_133) *Dispenser:* Both as
author and goal, the Lord is the dispenser of the fruit of all actions.

*Friend:* Doer of good without expecting any return.
