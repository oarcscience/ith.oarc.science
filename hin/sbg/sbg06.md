# SRIMAD-BHAGAVAD-GITA

<span id="page_1">p. 1</span>

### FIRST CHAPTER

Dhritarâshtra said:

1\. Tell me, O Sanjaya! Assembled on Kurukshetra, the centre of
religious activity, desirous to fight, what indeed did my people and the
Pândavas do? <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

Sanjaya said:

2\. But then King Duryodhana, having seen the Pândava forces in
battle-array, approached his teacher Drona, and spoke these words: <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md)

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

3\. "Behold, O Teacher! this mighty army of the sons of Pându, arrayed
by the son of Drupada, thy gifted pupil. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3.md)

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

4-6. "Here (are) heroes, mighty archers, the equals in battle of Bhima
and Arjuna—the great warriors Yuyudhâna, Virâta, Drupada; the valiant
Dhrishtaketu, Chekitâna and the king of Kâshi; the best of men, Purujit,
Kunti-Bhoja and Shaivya; the powerful Yudhâmanyu, and the brave
Uttamaujas, the son of Subhadrâ, and the sons of Draupadi,—lords of
great chariots. <span id="fr_4"></span>[4](#fn_4.md)

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

7\. "Hear also, O Best of the twice-born! the names of those who (are)
distinguished amongst ourselves, the leaders of my army. These I relate
(to you) for your information. <span id="fr_5"></span>[7](#fn_5.md)

8\. "Yourself and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa, the victorious in war.
Asvatthâmâ and Vikarna and Jayadratha, the son of Somadatta. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[8](#fn_6.md)

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

9\. "And many other heroes also, well-skilled in fight, and armed with
many kinds of weapons, are here, determined to lay down their lives for
my sake.

10\. "This our army defended by Bhishma (is) impossible to be counted,
but that army of theirs, defended by Bhima (is) easy to number. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[10](#fn_7.md)

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

11\. "(Now) do, being stationed in your proper places in the divisions
of the army, support Bhishma alone." <span id="fr_8"></span>[11](#fn_8.md)

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

12\. That powerful, oldest of the Kurus, Bhishma the grandsire, in order
to cheer Duryodhana, now sounded aloud a lion-roar and blew his
conch. <span id="fr_9"></span>[12](#fn_9.md)

13\. Then following Bhishma, conches and kettle-drums, tabors, trumpets
and

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

cowhorns blared forth suddenly from the Kaurava side and the noise was
tremendous.

14\. Then, also, Mâdhava and Pândava, stationed in their magnificent
chariot yoked with white horses, blew their divine conches with a
furious noise.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

15\. Hrishikesha blew the Pânchajanya, Dhananjaya, the Devadatta, and
Vrikodara, the doer of terrific deeds, his large conch Paundra.

16\. King Yudhishthira, son of Kunti, blew the conch named Anantavijaya,
and Nakula and Sahadeva, their Sughosha and Manipushpaka.

17\. The expert bowman, king of Kâshi, and the great warrior Shikhandi,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Dhrishtadyumna and
Virâta and the unconquered Sâtyaki;

18\. O Lord of Earth! Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, and the
mighty-armed son of Subhadrâ, all, also blew each his own conch.

19\. And the terrific noise resounding throughout heaven and earth rent
the hearts of Dhritarâshtra's party. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[19](#fn_10.md)

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

20\. Then, O Lord of Earth, seeing Dhritarâshtra's party standing
marshalled and the shooting about to begin, that Pândava whose ensign
was the monkey,

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

raising his bow, said the following words to Krishna: <span
id="fr_11"></span>[20](#fn_11.md)

Arjuna said:

21-22. Place my chariot, O Achyuta! between the two armies that I may
see those who stand here prepared for war. On this eve of battle (let me
know) with whom I have to fight.

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

23\. For I desire to observe those who are assembled here for fight,
wishing to please the evil-minded Duryodhana by taking his side on this
battle-field. <span id="fr_12"></span>[23](#fn_12.md)

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

Sanjaya said:

24-25. Commanded thus by Gudâkesha, Hrishikesha, O Bhârata, drove that
grandest of chariots to a place between the two hosts, facing Bhishma,
Drona and all the rulers of the earth, and then spoke thus, "Behold, O
Pârtha, all the Kurus gathered together!"

26\. Then saw Pârtha stationed there in both the armies, grandfathers,
fathers-in-law and uncles, brothers and cousins, his own and their sons
and grandsons, and

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

comrades, teachers, and other friends as well.

27\. Then he, the son of Kunti, seeing all those kinsmen stationed in
their ranks, spoke thus sorrowfully, filled with deep compassion.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

Arjuna said:

29\. Seeing, O Krishna, these my kinsmen gathered here, eager for fight,
my limbs fail me, and my mouth is parched up. I shiver all over, and my
hair stands on end. The bow Gândiva slips from my hand, and my skin
burns. <span id="fr_13"></span>[29](#fn_13.md)

30\. Neither, O Keshava, can I stand upright. My mind is in a whirl. And
I see adverse omens.

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

31\. Neither, O Krishna, do I see any good in killing these my own
people in battle. I desire neither victory nor empire, nor yet pleasure.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

32-34. Of what avail is dominion to us, of what avail are pleasures and
even life, if these, O Govinda! for whose sake it is desired that
empire, enjoyment and pleasure should be ours, themselves stand here in
battle, having renounced life and wealth—Teachers, uncles, sons and also
grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons,
brothers-in-law, besides other kinsmen.

35\. Even though these were to kill me, O slayer of Madhu, I could not
wish to kill them, not even for the sake of dominion over the three
worlds, how much less for the sake of the earth!

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

36\. What pleasure indeed could be ours, O Jnanârdana, from killing
these sons of Dhritarâshtra? Sin only could take hold of us by the
slaying of these felons. <span id="fr_14"></span>[36](#fn_14.md)

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

37\. Therefore ought we not to kill our kindred, the sons of
Dhritarâshtra. For how could we, O Mâdhava, gain happiness by the
slaying of our own kinsmen?

38-39. Though these, with understanding overpowered by greed, see no
evil due to decay of families, and no sin in hostility to friends, why
should we, O Janârdana, who see clearly the evil due to

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

the decay of families, not turn away from this sin?

40\. On the decay of a family the immemorial religious rites of that
family die out. On the destruction of spirituality, impiety further
overwhelms the whole of the family.

41\. On the prevalence of impiety, O Krishna, the women of the family
become corrupt; and women being corrupted,

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

there arises, O Vârshneya, intermingling of castes.

42\. Admixture of castes, indeed, is for the hell of the family and the
destroyers of the family; their ancestors fall, deprived of the
offerings of rice-ball and water. <span id="fr_15"></span>[42](#fn_15.md)

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

43\. By these misdeeds of the destroyers of the family, bringing about
confusion of castes, are the immemorial religious rites of the caste and
the family destroyed.

44\. We have heard, O Janârdana, that inevitable is the dwelling in hell
of those men in whose families religious practices have been destroyed.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

45\. Alas, we are involved in a great sin, in that we are prepared to
slay our kinsmen, from greed of the pleasures of a kingdom!

46\. Verily, if the sons of Dhritarâshtra, weapons in hand, were to slay
me, unresisting and unarmed, in the battle, that would be better for me.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Sanjaya said:

47\. Speaking thus in the midst of the battle-field, Arjuna casting away
his bow and arrows, sank down on the seat of his chariot, with his mind
distressed with sorrow.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[1:1](sbg06.htm#fr_1.md) True it is that the two
parties were gathered together for battle, but was the influence of
Kurukshetra, the sacred centre of religious and spiritual activity from
of old, barren of any result? Did not <span id="page_3">p. 3</span> the
spiritual influence of the spot affect any of the leaders in a way
unfavourable to the occurrence of the battle? is the purport of
Dhritarâshtra's question.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[2:2](sbg06.htm#fr_2.md) Sanjaya's reply beginning
with "But then" and describing Duryodhana's action is a plain hint to
the old king that his son was afraid. For he went to his teacher
(regarded as father) instead of to the commander-in-chief, as a child in
fright would run to its parents in preference to others.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[3:3](sbg06.htm#fr_3.md) As a scorpion would sting
even that whose protection is sought to be free from fear, so did the
wicked Duryodhana insult his teacher. His meaning in plain words comes
to this: just think of your stupidity in teaching the science of fight
to the son of Drupada and to those of Pându. They are now arrayed to
kill you!

<span id="fn_4"></span>[4:4](sbg06.htm#fr_4.md) great-charioted: one who is
well-versed in the science of war and commands eleven thousand bowmen.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[5:7](sbg06.htm#fr_5.md) However well-versed in the
science of war you might be, you are after all a Brâhmana (best of the
twice-born) a lover of peace, that is to say, a coward. It is therefore
natural for you to be afraid of the Pândava force. But take heart, we
too have, great warriors in our ranks—is the veiled meaning of
Duryodhana's words.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[5:8](sbg06.htm#fr_6.md) Afraid lest he had said too
much Duryodhana is flattering Drona, by mentioning the latter before
<span id="page_6">p. 6</span> even Bhishma and qualifying Drona's
brother-in law with the phrase 'victorious in war,' a move likely to
touch the heart of most mortals.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[6:10](sbg06.htm#fr_7.md) <span id="page_7">p.
7</span> In ancient Indian warfare, one commanding a force had for his
main-stay a defender about him, whose position was no less important.
Here are given the names of the chief defenders, and not of the chief
commanders.

The verse is often interpreted to mean that Duryodhana considers his
army inefficient and that of the enemy efficient. But this view seems
inapposite to the context.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[7:11](sbg06.htm#fr_8.md) Since I cannot expect from
you any initiative, do what you are told to do,—seems to be Duryodhana's
intention.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[8:12](sbg06.htm#fr_9.md) All eyes were turned upon
Duryodhana and the penetrating intelligence of Bhishma detected his
fear; and since Drona took no notice of Duryodhana's words, knowing his
grandson as he did, he had no difficulty in understanding that the
latter had spoken to his teacher in a way which called forth Drona's
coldness instead of his enthusiasm. The grandsire's heart was moved with
pity and hence the action on his part described in the above verse. It
should here be noted that this action, amounting to a challenge, really
began the fight. It was the Kaurava side again which took the
aggressor's part.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[11:19](sbg06.htm#fr_10.md) Verses 14-19 are full
of hints about the superiority of the Pândava party and the consequent
<span id="page_12">p. 12</span> sure defeat of Dhritarâshtra. The figure
to which Sanjaya draws the old king's attention as first taking up
Bhishma's challenge, is described by him as the Lord of Fortune and the
Pândava—the best of the Pându princes. Note also the details in which
the chariot, horses and conches of the Pândava party are described, and
finally though the army of the Kauravas was more than a third as much
again as that of the Pândavas, the noise made by the former was only
tremendous, whereas that of the latter was not only tremendous but
filled the earth and sky with reverberations and rent the hearts of the
former.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[13:20](sbg06.htm#fr_11.md) In view of the sudden
change of feeling that is to come over Arjuna it should be noted how
full of the war-spirit we find him in this verse.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[14:23](sbg06.htm#fr_12.md) Arjuna is impatient to
see who dared face him in fight!

<span id="fn_13"></span>[17:29](sbg06.htm#fr_13.md) Compassion overpowered
him. Not that it was due to discrimination, but rather to the lack of
this. He lost self-control—the first step into the abyss of ignorance.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[20:36](sbg06.htm#fr_14.md) *Felons:* Atatâyi, one
who sets fire to the house of, administers poison to, falls upon with a
sword on, steals the wealth, land and wife of, another person.
Duryodhana did all these to the Pândava brothers. According to the Artha
Shâstras, no sin is incurred by killing an Atatâyin, even if he be
thoroughly versed in Vedânta. But Arjuna seems to argue, "True, there
may not be incurred the particular sin of slaying one's own kith and kin
by killing the sons of Dhritarâshtra inasmuch as they are Atatâyins, but
then the general sin of killing is sure to take hold of us, for Dharma
Shâstra which is more authoritative than Artha Shâstra enjoins
non-killing."

<span id="fn_15"></span>[23:42](sbg06.htm#fr_15.md) Verily, confusion of
family is the hell of destroyers of family. (For then do) their own
ancestors fall, deprived &c. This refers to the well-known Srâddha
ceremony of the Hindus, the main principle of which consists in sending
helpful thoughts to the dead relations, as well as to all the occupants
of Pitri-loka (a temporary abode, immediately after death) accompanied
with (to make the thoughts more forcible) concrete offerings. The poor
are also fed to secure their good wishes.
