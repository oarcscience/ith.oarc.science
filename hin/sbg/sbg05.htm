<p>O blessed Mother<br> Who showerest (upon us) the nectar of Advaita<br> In the form of (these) eighteen chapters!<br> Thou Destroyer of rebirth!<br> Thou loving Mother!<br> Thou Bhagavad-Git&acirc;!<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon Thee I meditate.</p>  
<p>Thee, O Vy&acirc;sa, of lotus-eyes,<br> And mighty intellect,<br> Who hast lighted the lamp of wisdom<br> Filled with the oil of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee we salute.</p>  
<p>O Thou who art the Refuge<br> Of the (ocean-born) Lakshmi,<br> Thou in whose right hand is the shepherd's crook,<br> Who art the milker of the divine nectar of the Git&acirc;,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Thee, O Krishna, to Thee our salutation!</p>  
<p>The Upanishads are even as the herd of cows,<br> The Son of the cowherd as the milker,<br> P&acirc;rtha as the sucking-calf,<br> And men of purified intellect the drinkers,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of this, the supreme nectar, the milk of the Git&acirc;.</p>

<p>Thou son of Vasudeva,<br> Destroyer of Kamsa and Ch&acirc;nura,<br> Thou supreme bliss of Devaki,<br> Guru of the Worlds,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee, O Krishna, as God, we salute!</p>  
<p>Of that great river of battle which the P&acirc;ndavas crossed over,<br> Bhishma and Drona were as the high banks;<br> And Jayadratha as the water of the river;<br> The King of G&acirc;ndh&acirc;ra the water-lily;<br> Shalya as the sharks, Kripa as the current;<br> Karna the mighty waves;<br> Ashvatth&acirc;m&acirc; and Vikarna dread water-monsters,<br> And Duryodhana was the very whirlpool;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Thou, O Krishna, wast the Ferry-man!</p>  
<p>This spotless product of the words of Vy&acirc;sa,<br> This lotus of the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata,&#8212;<br> With the Bhagavad-Git&acirc; as its strong sweet fragrance,<br> And tales of heroes as its full-blown petals,<br> Held ever open by the talk of Hari, of Him<br> Who is destroyer of the taint of Kali-Yuga;<br> This lotus to which come joyously<br> Day after day the honey-seeking souls,&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May this produce in us the highest good!</p>  
<p>Him Whose compassion maketh the dumb man eloquent,<br> And the cripple to cross mountains,<br> Him the All-blissful M&acirc;dhava,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I salute!</p>  
<p><a name="page_xiv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xiv</font></A></p>  
<p>To that Supreme One Who is bodied forth in Brahm&acirc;,<br> In Varuna, in Indra, in Rudra and Maruts;<br> That One Whom all divine beings praise with hymns;<br> Him Whom the singers of S&acirc;ma-Veda tell;<br> Him of Whose glory, sing in full choir, The Upanishads and Vedas;<br> Him Whom the Yogis see, with mind absorbed in perfect meditation;<br> Him of Whom all the hosts of Devas and Asuras<br> Know not the limitations,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Him, the Supreme Good, be salutation,&#8212;<br> Him we salute. Him we salute. Him we salute.</p>
