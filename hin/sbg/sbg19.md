### FOURTEENTH CHAPTER

The Blessed Lord said:

1\. Again shall I tell thee that supreme knowledge which is above all
knowledge, having known which all the Munis have attained to high
perfection after this life. <span id="fr_298"></span>[1](#fn_298)

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

2\. They who having devoted themselves to this knowledge, have attained
to My Being, are neither born at the time of creation, nor are they
troubled at the time of dissolution.

3\. My womb is the great Prakriti; in that I place the germ; from
thence, O descendant of Bharata, is the birth of all beings. <span
id="fr_299"></span>[3](#fn_299)

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

4\. Whatever forms are produced, O son of Kunti, in all the wombs, the
great Prakriti is their womb, and I the seed-giving Father.

5\. Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas,—these Gunas, O mighty-armed, born of
Prakriti, bind fast in the body the indestructible embodied one. <span
id="fr_300"></span>[5](#fn_300)

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

6\. Of these Sattva, from its stainlessness luminous and free from evil,
binds, O sinless one, by attachment to happiness, and by attachment to
knowledge. <span id="fr_301"></span>[6](#fn_301)

7\. Know Rajas to be of the nature of passion, giving rise to thirst and
attachment;

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

it binds fast, O son of Kunti, the embodied one, by attachment to
action. <span id="fr_302"></span>[7](#fn_302)

8\. And know Tamas to be born of ignorance, stupefying all embodied
beings; it binds fast, O descendant of Bharata, by miscomprehension,
indolence, and sleep. <span id="fr_303"></span>[8](#fn_303)

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

9\. Sattva attaches to happiness, and Rajas to action, O descendant of
Bharata; while Tamas, verily, shrouding discrimination, attaches to
miscomprehension.

10\. Sattva arises, O descendant of Bharata, predominating over Rajas
and 'Tamas; and Rajas over Sattva and Tamas; so, Tamas over Sattva and
Rajas. <span id="fr_304"></span>[10](#fn_304)

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

11\. When through every sense in this body, the light of intelligence
shines, then it should be known that Sattva is predominant. <span
id="fr_305"></span>[11](#fn_305)

12\. Greed, activity, the undertaking of actions, unrest, longing—these
arise when Rajas is predominant, O bull of the: Bhâratas. <span
id="fr_306"></span>[12](#fn_306)

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

13\. Darkness, inertness, miscomprehension, and delusion,—these arise
when Tamas is predominant, O descendant of Kuru. <span
id="fr_307"></span>[13](#fn_307)

14\. If the embodied one meets death when Sattva is predominant, then he
attains to the spotless regions of the worshippers of the Highest. <span
id="fr_308"></span>[14](#fn_308)

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

15\. Meeting death in Rajas he is born among those attached to action;
so dying in Tamas, he is born in the wombs of the irrational. <span
id="fr_309"></span>[15](#fn_309)

16\. The fruit of good action, they say, is Sâttvika and pure; verily,
the fruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas. <span
id="fr_310"></span>[16](#fn_310)

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

17\. From Sattva arises wisdom, and greed from Rajas; miscomprehension,
delusion and ignorance arise from Tamas.

18\. The Sattva-abiding go upwards; the Râjasika dwell in the middle;
and the Tâmasika, abiding in the function. of the lowest Guna, go
downwards.

19\. When the seer beholds no agent other than the Gunas and knows That
which is higher than the Gunas, he attains to My being. <span
id="fr_311"></span>[19](#fn_311)

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

20\. The embodied one having gone beyond these three Gunas out of which
the body is evolved, is freed from birth, death, decay and pain, and
attains to immortality.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

Arjuna said:

21\. By what marks, O Lord, is he (known) who has gone beyond these
three Gunas? What is his conduct, and how does he pass beyond these
three Gunas?

The Blessed Lord said:

22\. He who hates not the appearance of light, (the effect of Sattva),
activity (the effect of Rajas), and delusion (the effect of Tamas), (in
his own mind), O Pândava, nor longs for them when absent; <span
id="fr_312"></span>[22](#fn_312)

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

23\. He who, sitting like one unconcerned, is moved not by the Gunas,
who, knowing that the Gunas operate, is Self-centred and swerves not;

24\. Alike in pleasure and pain, Self-abiding, regarding a clod of
earth, a stone and gold alike; the same to agreeable and disagreeable,
firm, the same in censure and, praise; <span
id="fr_313"></span>[24](#fn_313)

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

25\. The same in honour and disgrace, the same to friend and foe,
relinquishing all undertakings—he is said to have gone beyond the
Gunas. <span id="fr_314"></span>[25](#fn_314)

26\. And he who serves Me with an unswerving devotion, he, going beyond
the Gunas, is fitted for becoming Brahman. <span
id="fr_315"></span>[26](#fn_315)

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

27\. For I am the abode of Brahman, the Immortal and Immutable, of
everlasting Dharma and of Absolute Bliss. <span
id="fr_316"></span>[27](#fn_316)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_298"></span>[308:1](sbg19.htm#fr_298) *After this
life*—after being freed from this bondage of the body.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[309:3](sbg19.htm#fr_299) *Brahma:* This word
is derived from Brimh, 'to expand,' and means here the vast seed or womb
(the Prakriti) out of which the cosmos is evolved or expanded.

*I place the germ:* I infuse the reflection of My Intelligence, and this
act of impregnation is the cause of the evolution of the cosmos.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[310:5](sbg19.htm#fr_300) *These Gunas*—are the
primary constituents of the Prakriti and are the bases of all
substances; they cannot therefore be said to be attributes or qualities
inhering in the substances as opposed to the substances.

*Embodied one:* he who abides in the body as if identified therewith.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[311:6](sbg19.htm#fr_301) *Binds by attachment
to happiness &c.:* Binds the Self by the consciousness of happiness and
knowledge in the shape of 'I am happy,' 'I am wise,' which belongs
properly to the Kshetra, but which is associated with the Self, the
Absolute Intelligence and Bliss, through Avidyâ.

<span id="fn_302"></span>[312:7](sbg19.htm#fr_302) *It binds &c.*—Though
the Self is not the agent, Rajas makes Him act with the idea 'I am the
doer.'

<span id="fn_303"></span>[312:8](sbg19.htm#fr_303) *Stupefying:* causing
delusion or non-discrimination.

<span id="fn_304"></span>[313:10](sbg19.htm#fr_304) When one or the
other of the Gunas asserts itself predominating over the other two, it
produces its own effect. Sattva produces knowledge and happiness; Rajas,
action; Tamas, veiling of discrimination &c.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[314:11](sbg19.htm#fr_305) *Every sense*—lit.,
all the gates. All the senses are for the Self the gateways of
perception.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[314:12](sbg19.htm#fr_306) *Unrest*—being
agitated with joy, attachment &c.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[315:13](sbg19.htm#fr_307) *Darkness,
inertness:* Absence of discrimination, and its results, inertness &c.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[315:14](sbg19.htm#fr_308) *Spotless regions:*
The Brahma-loka and the like.

*The Highest*—Deities such as Hiranyagarbha.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[316:15](sbg19.htm#fr_309) *Meeting . . .
Rajas:* If he dies when Rajas is predominant in him.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[316:16](sbg19.htm#fr_310) *Rajas*—means
Râjasika action, and Tamas,—Tâmasika action, as this section treats of
actions.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[317:19](sbg19.htm#fr_311) *The Gunas*—which
transform themselves into the bodies, senses and sense-objects, and
which in <span id="page_318">p. 318</span> all their modifications
constitute the agent in all actions.

*Knows . . . the Gunas:* Sees Him who is distinct from the Gunas, who is
the Witness of the Gunas and of their functions.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[319:22](sbg19.htm#fr_312) This answers
Arjuna's first question. The man of right knowledge does not hate the
effects of the three Gunas when they clearly present themselves as
objects of consciousness; nor does he long after things which have
disappeared.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[320:24](sbg19.htm#fr_313) *Self-abiding:* He
remains in his own true-nature.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[321:25](sbg19.htm#fr_314) Inclining to neither
of the dual throng, he firmly treads the path of Self-knowledge, and
rises above the Gunas.

These three Slokas are in answer to Arjuna's second question.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[321:26](sbg19.htm#fr_315) This answers
Arjuna's third question.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[322:27](sbg19.htm#fr_316) *I*—the
Pratyagâtman, the true Inner-Self.
