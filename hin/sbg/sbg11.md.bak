### SIXTH CHAPTER

The Blessed Lord said:

1\. He who performs his bounden duty without leaning to the fruit of
action —he is a renouncer of action as well as of steadfast mind: not he
who is without fire, nor he who is without action. <span
id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md)

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

2\. Know that to be devotion to action, which is called renunciation, O
Pândava, for none becomes a devotee to action without forsaking
Sankalpa. <span id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_135.md)

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

3\. For the man of meditation wishing to attain purification of heart
leading to concentration, work is said to be the way: For him, when he
has attained such (concentration), inaction is said to be the way. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_136.md)

4\. Verily, when there is no attachment, either to sense-objects, or to
actions, having renounced all Sankalpas, then is one said to have
attained concentration. <span id="fr_137"></span>[4](#fn_137.md)

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

5\. A man should uplift himself by his own self, so let him not weaken
this self. For this self is the friend of oneself, and this self is the
enemy of oneself. <span id="fr_138"></span>[5](#fn_138.md)

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

6\. The self (the active part of our nature) is the friend of the self,
for him who has conquered himself by this self. But to the unconquered
self, this self is inimical, (and behaves) like (an external) foe. <span
id="fr_139"></span>[6](#fn_139.md)

7\. To the self-controlled and serene, the Supreme Self is, the object
of constant, realisation, in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as well
as in honour and dishonour. <span id="fr_140"></span>[7](#fn_140.md)

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

8\. Whose heart is filled with satisfaction by wisdom and realisation,
and is changeless, whose senses are conquered, and to whom a lump of
earth, stone, and gold are the same: that Yogi is called
steadfast. <span id="fr_141"></span>[8](#fn_141.md)

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

9\. He attains excellence who looks with equal regard upon well-wishers,
friends, foes, neutrals, arbiters, the hateful, the relatives, and upon
the righteous and the unrighteous alike.

10\. The Yogi should constantly practise concentration of the heart,
retiring into solitude, alone, with the mind and body subdued, and free
from hope and possession.

11\. Having in a cleanly spot established his seat, firm, neither too
high nor

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

too low, made of a cloth, a skin, and Kusha-grass, arranged in
consecution: <span id="fr_142"></span>[11](#fn_142.md)

12\. There, seated on that seat, making the mind one-pointed and
subduing the action of the imaging faculty and the senses, let him
practise Yoga for the purification of the heart.

13\. Let him firmly hold his body, head and neck erect and still, (with
the eye-balls fixed, as if) gazing at the tip of his nose, and not
looking around. <span id="fr_143"></span>[13](#fn_143.md)

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

14\. With the heart serene and fearless, firm in the vow of a
Brahmachâri, with the mind controlled, and ever thinking of Me, let him
sit (in Yoga) having Me as his supreme goal.

15\. Thus always keeping the mind steadfast, the Yogi of subdued mind
attains the peace residing in Me,—the

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

peace which culminates in Nirvâna (Moksha).

16\. (Success in) Yoga is not for him who eats too much or too
little—nor, O Arjuna, for him who sleeps too much or too little. <span
id="fr_144"></span>[16](#fn_144.md)

17\. To him who is temperate in eating and recreation, in his effort for
work,

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

and in sleep and wakefulness, Yoga becomes the destroyer of misery.

18\. When the completely controlled mind rests serenely in the Self
alone, free from longing after all desires, then is one called
steadfast, (in the Self).

19\. "As a lamp in a spot sheltered from the wind does not
flicker,"—even such has been the simile used for a Yogi of subdued mind,
practising concentration in the Self.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span> <span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

20-23. When the mind, absolutely restrained by the practice of
concentration, attains quietude, and when seeing the Self by the self,
one is satisfied in his own Self; when he feels that infinite
bliss—which is perceived by the (purified) intellect and which
transcends the senses, and established wherein he never departs from his
real state; and having obtained which, regards no other acquisition
superior to that, and where established, he is not moved even by heavy
sorrow;—let that be known as the state, called by the name of Yoga,—a
state of severance from the contact of pain. This Yoga should be
practised with perseverance, undisturbed by depression of heart. <span
id="fr_145"></span>[20](#fn_145.md)

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

24\. Abandoning without reserve all desires born of Sankalpa, and
completely restraining, by the mind alone, the whole group of senses
from their objects in all directions;

25\. With the intellect set in patience, with the mind fastened on the
Self, let him attain quietude by degrees: let him not think of anything.

26\. Through whatever reason the

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

restless, unsteady mind wanders away, let him curbing it from that,
bring it under the subjugation of the Self alone.

27\. Verily, the supreme bliss comes to that Yogi, of perfectly tranquil
mind, with passions quieted, Brahman-become, and freed from taint. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[27](#fn_146.md)

28\. The Yogi freed from taint (of good and evil), constantly engaging
the mind thus, with ease attains the infinite bliss of contact with
Brahman.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

29\. With the heart concentrated by Yoga, with the eye of evenness for
all things, he beholds the Self in all beings and all beings in the
Self.

30\. He who sees Me in all things, and sees all things in Me, he never
becomes separated from Me, nor do I become separated from him. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[30](#fn_147.md)

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

31\. He who being established in unity, worships Me, who am dwelling in
all beings, whatever his mode of life, that Yogi abides in Me. <span
id="fr_148"></span>[31](#fn_148.md)

32\. He who judges of pleasure or pain everywhere, by the same standard
as he applies to himself, that Yogi, O Arjuna, is regarded as the
highest. <span id="fr_149"></span>[32](#fn_149.md)

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

Arjuna said:

33\. This Yoga which has been taught by Thee, O slayer of Madhu, as
characterised by evenness, I do not see (the possibility of) its lasting
endurance, owing to restlessness (of the mind).

34\. Verily, the mind, O Krishna, is restless, turbulent, strong, and
unyielding;. I regard it quite as hard to achieve its control, as that
of the wind. <span id="fr_150"></span>[34](#fn_150.md)

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

35\. Without doubt, O mighty-armed, the mind is restless, and difficult
to control; but through practice and renunciation, O son of Kunti, it
may be governed. <span id="fr_151"></span>[35](#fn_151.md)

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

36\. Yoga is hard to be attained by one of uncontrolled self: such is My
conviction; but the self-controlled, striving by right means, can obtain
it.

Arjuna said:

37\. Though possessed of Shraddhâ but unable to control himself, with
the mind wandering away from Yoga, what end does one, failing to gain
perfection in Yoga, meet, O Krishna?

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

38\. Does he not, fallen from both, perish, without support, like a rent
cloud, O mighty-armed, deluded in the path of Brahman? <span
id="fr_152"></span>[38](#fn_152.md)

39\. This doubt of mine, O Krishna, Thou shouldst completely dispel; for
it is not possible for any but Thee to dispel this doubt. <span
id="fr_153"></span>[39](#fn_153.md)

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

40\. Verily, O son of Prithâ, there is destruction for him, neither here
nor hereafter: for, the doer of good, O my son, never comes to
grief. <span id="fr_154"></span>[40](#fn_154.md)

41\. Having attained to the worlds of the righteous, and dwelling there
for everlasting years, one fallen from Yoga reincarnates in the home of
the pure and the prosperous. <span id="fr_155"></span>[41](#fn_155.md)

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

42\. Or else he is born into a family of wise Yogis only; verily, a
birth such as that is very rare to obtain in this world. <span
id="fr_156"></span>[42](#fn_156.md)

43\. There he is united with the intelligence acquired in his former
body, and strives more than before, for perfection, O son of the
Kurus. <span id="fr_157"></span>[43](#fn_157.md)

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

44\. By that previous practice alone, he is borne on in spite of
himself. Even the enquirer after Yoga rises superior to the performer of
Vedic actions. <span id="fr_158"></span>[44](#fn_158.md)

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

45\. The Yogi, striving assiduously, purified of taint, gradually
gaining perfection through many births, then reaches the highest goal.

46\. The Yogi is regarded as superior to those who practise asceticism,
also to those who have obtained wisdom (through the Shâstras). He is
also superior to the performers of action, (enjoined in the Vedas).
Therefore, be thou a Yogi, O Arjuna! <span
id="fr_159"></span>[46](#fn_159.md)

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

47\. And of all Yogis, he who with the inner self merged in Me, with
Shraddhâ devotes himself to Me, is considered by Me the most
steadfast. <span id="fr_160"></span>[47](#fn_160.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_134"></span>[137:1](sbg11.htm#fr_134.md) *Bounden duty:*
Nityakarma.

*Renouncer of action as well as of steadfast mind:* Sannyâsi and Yogi.

*Without fire:* He that has renounced actions enjoined by the Vedas,
requiring fire as adjunct, *e.g.*, Agnihotra. <span id="page_138">p.
138</span>

*Without action:* He who has renounced actions which do not require fire
as adjunct, such as austerities and meritorious acts like digging wells
etc.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[138:2](sbg11.htm#fr_135.md) *Sankalpa*—is the
working of the imaging faculty, forming fancies, making plans and again
brushing them aside, conceiving future results, starting afresh on a new
line, leading to different issues, and so on and so forth. No one can be
a Karma-Yogin or a devotee to action, who makes plans and wishes for the
fruit of action.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[139:3](sbg11.htm#fr_136.md) *Purification of the
heart leading to concentration*—Yoga. "For a Brâhmana there is no wealth
like unto (the eye of) one-ness, (and) even-ness, trueness, refinement,
steadiness, harmlessness, straightforwardness, and gradual withdrawal
from all action."—Mahâbhârata, Shânti Parva. 175, 88.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[139:4](sbg11.htm#fr_137.md) *Attained
concentration:* Yogârudha.

*Renouncer of all Sankalpas:* "O desire, I know where thy root lies:
thou art born of Sankalpa. I <span id="page_140">p. 140</span> shall not
think of thee, and thou shalt cease to exist, together with thy root."
Mahâbhârata. Shânti Parva. 177, 25.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[140:5](sbg11.htm#fr_138.md) The self-conscious
nature of man is here considered in two aspects as being both the object
of spiritual uplift and the subject of spiritual uplift, the ego acted
upon and the ego acting upon the former. This latter active principle or
ego should be kept strong in its uplifting function, for it. is apt to
turn an enemy, if it is not a friend, and the next verse explains the
reason.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[141:6](sbg11.htm#fr_139.md) The self is the
friend of one, in whom the aggregate of the body and the senses has been
brought under control, and an enemy when such in not the case.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[141:7](sbg11.htm#fr_140.md) Hence he remains
unruffled in pleasant and adverse environments.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[142:8](sbg11.htm#fr_141.md) *Wisdom*—Jnâna:
knowledge of Shâstras. *Realisation*—Vijnâna: one's own experience of
the teachings of Shâstras.

*Changeless*—like the anvil. Things are hammered and shaped on the
anvil, but the anvil remains unchanged: in the same manner he is called
Kutastha—whose heart remains unchanged though objects are present.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[144:11](sbg11.htm#fr_142.md) *Arranged in
consecution:* that is,—the Kusha-grass arranged on the ground; above
that, a tiger or deer skin, covered by a cloth.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[144:13](sbg11.htm#fr_143.md) *Gazing at the tip
of his nose*,—could not be-literally meant here, because then the mind
would be fixed only there, and not on the Self: when the eyes are
half-closed in meditation, and the eye-balls are still, the gaze is
directed, *as it were*, on the tip of the nose.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[146:16](sbg11.htm#fr_144.md) The Yoga-shâstra
prescribes: "Half (the stomach) for food and condiments, the third
(quarter) for water, and the fourth should be reserved for free motion
of air."

<span id="fn_145"></span>[149:20](sbg11.htm#fr_145.md) *Which is perceived
. . . intellect:* Which the purified intellect can grasp independently
of the senses. When in meditation the mind is deeply concentrated, the
senses do not function and are resolved into their cause,—that is, the
mind; and when the latter is steady, so that there is only the intellect
functioning, or in other words, cognition only exists, the indescribable
Self is realised.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[151:27](sbg11.htm#fr_146.md) *Brahman-become*,
*i.e.*, one who has realised that all is Brahman.

*Taint*—of good and evil.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[152:30](sbg11.htm#fr_147.md) *Separated*, *i.e.*,
by time, space, or anything intervening.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[153:31](sbg11.htm#fr_148.md) *Worships Me:*
realises Me as the Self of all.

*Established in unity*, *i.e.*, having resolved all duality in the
underlying unity.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[153:32](sbg11.htm#fr_149.md) Seeing that whatever
is pleasure or pain to, himself, is alike pleasure or pain to all
beings, he, the highest of Yogins, wishes good to all and evil to
none,—he is always harmless and compassionate to all creatures.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[154:34](sbg11.htm#fr_150.md) <span
id="page_155">p. 155</span> '*Krishna*,' is derived from 'Krish,' to
scrape: Krishna is so called, because He scrapes or draws away all sins
and other evils from His devotees.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[155:35](sbg11.htm#fr_151.md) Cf. Patanjali I. 12.

*Practice:* Earnest and repeated attempt to make the mind steady in its
unmodified state of Pure Intelligence, by means of constant meditation
upon the chosen Ideal.

*Renunciation:* Freedom from desire for any pleasures, seen or unseen,
achieved by a constant perception of evil in them.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[157:38](sbg11.htm#fr_152.md) *Fallen from both:*
That is, from both the paths of knowledge and action.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[157:39](sbg11.htm#fr_153.md) Since there can be
no better teacher than the Omniscient Lord.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[158:40](sbg11.htm#fr_154.md) *Tâta*—son. A
disciple is looked upon as a son; Arjuna is thus addressed having placed
himself in the position of a disciple to Krishna.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[158:41](sbg11.htm#fr_155.md) *Everlasting
years*—not absolutely, meaning a very long period.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[159:42](sbg11.htm#fr_156.md) *Very rare:* more
difficult than the one mentioned in the preceding Sloka.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[159:43](sbg11.htm#fr_157.md)
*Intelligence*—Samskâra: Store of experience in the shape of impressions
and habits.

*Strives . . . perfection:* Strives more strenuously to attain to higher
planes of realisation than those acquired in his former birth.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[160:44](sbg11.htm#fr_158.md) *Borne on in spite
of himself:* carried to the goal of the course which he marked out for
himself in his last incarnation, by the force of his former Samskâras,
though he might be unconscious of them—or even unwilling to pursue it,
owing to the interference of some untoward Karma.

*Rises &c.:* lit. goes beyond the Word-Brahman, *i.e.*, the Vedas.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[161:46](sbg11.htm#fr_159.md) *Wisdom:* Knowledge
from precepts, but not direct insight into the Divine Truth.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[162:47](sbg11.htm#fr_160.md) *Of all Yogis
&c.:*—of all Yogis he who devotes himself to the All-pervading Infinite,
is superior to those who devote themselves to the lesser ideals, or
gods, such as Vasu, Rudra, Aditya, etc.
