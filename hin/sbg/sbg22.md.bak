### SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER

Arjuna said:

1\. Those who setting aside the ordinance of the Shâstra, perform
sacrifice with Shraddhâ, what is their condition, O Krishna? (Is it)
Sattva, Rajas or Tamas? <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_343.md)

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

2\. Threefold is the Shraddhâ of the embodied, which is inherent in
their nature,—the Sâttvika, the Râjasika and the Tâmasika. Do thou hear
of it. <span id="fr_344"></span>[2](#fn_344.md)

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

3\. The Shraddhâ of each is according to his natural disposition, O
descendant of Bharata. The man consists of his Shraddhâ; he verily is
what his Shraddhâ is. <span id="fr_345"></span>[3](#fn_345.md)

4\. Sâttvika men worship the Devas; Râjasika, the Yakshas and the
Râkshasas; the others—the Tâmasika men—the Pretas and the hosts of
Bhutas.

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

5-6. Those men who practise severe austerities not enjoined by the
Shâstras, given to ostentation and egoism, possessed with the power of
lust and attachment, torture, senseless as they are, all the organs in
the body, and Me dwelling in the body within; know them to be of Asurika
resolve. <span id="fr_346"></span>[5](#fn_346.md)

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

7\. The food also which is liked by each of them is threefold, as also
Yajna, austerity and almsgiving. Do thou hear this, their distinction.

8\. The foods which augment vitality, energy, strength, health,
cheerfulness and appetite, which are savoury and oleaginous, substantial
and [agreeable](errata.htm#4.md), are liked by the Sâttvika.

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

9\. The foods that are bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, pungent,
dry and burning, are liked by the Râjasika, and are productive of pain,
grief and disease. <span id="fr_347"></span>[9](#fn_347.md)

10\. That which is stale, tasteless, stinking, cooked overnight, refuse
and impure, is the food liked by the Tâmasika. <span
id="fr_348"></span>[10](#fn_348.md)

\[

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

11\. That Yajna is Sâttvika which is performed by men desiring no fruit,
as enjoined by ordinance, with their mind fixed on the Yajna only, for
its own sake.

12\. That which is performed, O best of the Bhâratas, seeking for fruit
and for ostentation, know it to be a Râjasika Yajna.

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

13\. The Yajna performed without heed to ordinance, in which no food is
distributed, which is devoid of Mantras, gifts, and Shraddhâ, is said to
be Tâmasika.

14\. Worship of the Devas, the twice-born, the Gurus and the wise,
purity, straightforwardness, continence, and non-injury are called the
austerity of the body.

15\. Speech which causes no vexation, and is true, as also agreeable and
beneficial, and regular study of the Vedas,—

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

these are said to form the austerity of speech. <span
id="fr_349"></span>[15](#fn_349.md)

16\. Serenity of mind, kindliness, silence, self-control, honesty of
motive,—this is called the mental austerity. <span
id="fr_350"></span>[16](#fn_350.md)

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

17\. This threefold austerity practised by steadfast men, with great
Shraddhâ, desiring no fruit, is said to be Sâttvika. <span
id="fr_351"></span>[17](#fn_351.md)

18\. That austerity which is practised with the object of gaining
welcome, honour and worship, and with ostentation, is here said to be
Râjasika, unstable and transitory. <span
id="fr_352"></span>[18](#fn_352.md)

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

19\. That austerity which is practised out of a foolish notion, with
self-torture or for the purpose of wining another, is declared to be
Tâmasika.

20\. To give is right, gift given with this idea, to one who does no
service in return, in a fit place and to a worthy person, that gift is
held to be Sâttvika. <span id="fr_353"></span>[20](#fn_353.md)

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

21\. And what is given with a view to receiving in return, or looking
for the fruit, or again reluctantly, that gift is held to be Râjasika.

22\. The gift that is given at the wrong place or time, to unworthy
persons, without regard or with disdain, that is declared to be
Tâmasika.

23\. "Om, Tat, Sat": this has been declared to be the triple designation
of Brahman. By that were made of old the Brâhmanas, the Vedas and the
Yajnas. <span id="fr_354"></span>[23](#fn_354.md)

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

24\. Therefore, uttering 'Om,' are the acts of sacrifice, gift and
austerity as enjoined in the ordinances, always begun by the followers
of the Vedas.

25\. Uttering Tat, without aiming at fruits, are the various acts of
Yajna, austerity and gift performed by the seekers of Moksha.

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

26\. The word Sat is used in the sense of reality and of goodness; and
so also, Pârtha, the word Sat is used in the sense of an auspicious act.

27\. Steadiness in Yajna, austerity and gift is also called 'Sat': as
also action in connection with these (or, action for the sake of the
Lord) is called Sat.

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

28\. Whatever is sacrificed, given or performed, and whatever austerity
is practised without Shraddhâ, it is called Asat, O Pârtha; it is naught
here or hereafter. <span id="fr_355"></span>[28](#fn_355.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_343"></span>[349:1](sbg22.htm#fr_343.md) *Setting . . .
Shraddhâ:* not that they believe the ordinance of the Shâstra to be
false, but out of laziness or because of the difficulty in adhering to
<span id="page_350">p. 350</span> them strictly, they let them alone and
worship the gods, endued with Shraddhâ.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[350:2](sbg22.htm#fr_344.md) *Inherent . . .
nature:* born of their past Samskâras. It—the threefold Shraddhâ.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[351:3](sbg22.htm#fr_345.md) Natural
disposition—the specific tendencies or Samskâras.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[352:5](sbg22.htm#fr_346.md) *Austerities*—which
cause pain to himself and to other living beings.

*Possessed attachment*—may also be interpreted as, 'possessed of lust,
attachment and power.'

*All the organs of the body:* the aggregate of all the elements
composing the body.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[354:9](sbg22.htm#fr_347.md) *Excessively*—this
word should be construed with each of the seven; thus, excessively
bitter, excessively sour, and so on.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[354:10](sbg22.htm#fr_348.md)
*Stale*—Yâtayâmam—lit. cooked three hours ago.

*Refuse:* left on the plate after a meal.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[357:15](sbg22.htm#fr_349.md) Speech, to be an
austerity, must form an invariable combination of all the four
attributes mentioned in the Sloka; if it lacks in one or other of them,
it will no longer be an austerity of speech.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[357:16](sbg22.htm#fr_350.md) *Silence*—Maunam—is
the result of the control of thought so far as it concerns speech. Or it
may mean, the condition of the Muni, *i.e.*, practice of meditation.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[358:17](sbg22.htm#fr_351.md)
*Steadfast*—unaffected in success and failure.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[358:18](sbg22.htm#fr_352.md) *With ostentation:*
for mere show, hypocritically, with no sincere belief.

*Here*—is explained also in the sense of 'of this world,' *i.e.*,
yielding fruit only in this world.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[359:20](sbg22.htm#fr_353.md) *Who . . . return:*
one who cannot, or who though able is not expected to return the good.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[360:23](sbg22.htm#fr_354.md) Om, Tat, Sat: Om is
the principal name of <span id="page_361">p. 361</span>the Lord, because
it means all that is manifest and the beyond. It also means "Yes." Tat
means "That"; the Indefinable, that which can only be described
indirectly as "That which." Sat means Reality; which is ever permanent
in one mode of being.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[363:28](sbg22.htm#fr_355.md) *It is naught here
or hereafter:* Though costing much trouble it is of no use here as it is
not acceptable to the wise ones, nor can it produce any effect conducive
to good hereafter.
