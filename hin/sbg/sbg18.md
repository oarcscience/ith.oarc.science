### THIRTEENTH CHAPTER

Arjuna said:

Prakriti and Purusha, also the Kshetra and the knower of the Kshetra,
knowledge, and that which ought to be known—these, O Keshava, I desire
to learn. <span id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_276.md)

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

The Blessed Lord said:

1\. This body, O son of Kunti, is called Kshetra, and he who knows it is
called Kshetrajna by those who know of them (Kshetra and
Kshetrajna). <span id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_277.md)

2\. Me do thou also know, O descendant of Bharata, to be Kshetrajna in
all Kshetras. The knowledge of Kshetra and Kshetrajna is considered by
Me to be the knowledge.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

3\. What the Kshetra is, what its properties are, what are its
modifications, what effects arise from what causes, and also who He is
and what His powers are, that hear from Me in brief. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[3](#fn_278.md)

4\. (This truth) has been sung by Rishis in many ways, in various
distinctive chants, in passages indicative of Brahman, full of
reasoning, and convincing.

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

5-6. The great Elements, Egoism, Intellect, as also the Unmanifested
(Mulâ Prakriti), the ten senses and the one (mind), and the five objects
of the senses; desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the, aggregate,
intelligence, fortitude,—the Kshetra has been thus briefly described
with its modifications. <span id="fr_279"></span>[5](#fn_279.md)

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

7\. Humility, unpretentiousness, non-injury, forbearance, uprightness,
service to the teacher, purity, steadiness, self-control; <span
id="fr_280"></span>[7](#fn_280.md)

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

8\. The renunciation of sense-objects, and also absence of egoism;
reflection on the evils of birth, death, old age, sickness and
pain; <span id="fr_281"></span>[8](#fn_281.md)

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

9\. Non-attachment, non-identification of self with son, wife, home, and
the rest, and constant even-mindedness in the occurrence of the
desirable and the un-undesirable; <span id="fr_282"></span>[9](#fn_282.md)

10\. Unswerving devotion to Me by the Yoga of non-separation, resort to
sequestered places, distaste for the society of men;  <span
id="fr_283"></span>[10](#fn_283.md)

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

11\. Constant application to spiritual knowledge, understanding of the
end of true knowledge: this is declared to be knowledge, and what is
opposed to it is ignorance. <span id="fr_284"></span>[11](#fn_284.md)

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

12\. I shall describe that which has to be known, knowing which one
attains to immortality, the beginningless Supreme Brahman. It is called
neither being nor non-being.

13\. With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths
everywhere, with ears everywhere in the universe,—That exists pervading
all.

14\. Shining by the functions of all the

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

senses, yet without the senses; Absolute, yet sustaining all; devoid of
Gunas, yet their experiencer.

15\. Without and within (all) beings; the unmoving and also the moving;
because of Its subtlety incomprehensible; It is far and near. <span
id="fr_285"></span>[15](#fn_285.md)

16\. Impartible, yet It exists as if divided in beings: It is to be
known as

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

sustaining beings; and devouring, as well as generating (them). <span
id="fr_286"></span>[16](#fn_286.md)

17\. The Light even of lights, It is said to be beyond darkness;
Knowledge, and the One Thing to be known, the Goal of' knowledge,
dwelling in the hearts of all. <span id="fr_287"></span>[17](#fn_287.md)

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

18\. Thus Kshetra, knowledge, and that which has to be known, have been
briefly stated. Knowing this, My devotee is fitted for My state.

19\. Know thou that Prakriti and Purusha are both beginningless; and
know thou also that all modifications and Gunas are born of
Prakriti. <span id="fr_288"></span>[19](#fn_288.md)

20\. In the production of the body and the senses, Prakriti is said to
be the cause; in the experience of pleasure and pain, Purusha is said to
be the cause. <span id="fr_289"></span>[20](#fn_289.md)

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

21\. Purusha seated in Prakriti, experiences the Gunas born of Prakriti;
the reason of his birth in good and evil wombs is his attachment to the
Gunas. <span id="fr_290"></span>[21](#fn_290.md)

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

22\. And the Supreme Purusha in this body is also called the Looker-on,
the Permitter, the Supporter, the Experiencer, the Great Lord, and the
Highest Self. <span id="fr_291"></span>[22](#fn_291.md)

23\. He who thus knows the Purusha and Prakriti together with the Gunas,
whatever his life, is not born again. <span
id="fr_292"></span>[23](#fn_292.md)

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

24\. Some by meditation behold the Self in their own intelligence by the
purified heart, others by the path of knowledge, others again by Karma
Yoga.

25\. Others again not knowing thus, worship as they have heard from
others.

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Even these go
beyond death, regarding what they have heard as the Supreme
Refuge. <span id="fr_293"></span>[25](#fn_293.md)

26\. Whatever being is born, the moving or the unmoving, O bull of the
Bhâratas, know it to be from the union of Kshetra and Kshetrajna. <span
id="fr_294"></span>[26](#fn_294.md)

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

27\. He sees, who sees the Lord Supreme, existing equally in all beings,
deathless in the dying.

28\. Since seeing the Lord equally existent everywhere, he injures not
Self by self, and so goes to the highest Goal. <span
id="fr_295"></span>[28](#fn_295.md)

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

29\. He sees, who sees that all actions are done by Prakriti alone and
that the Self is actionless.

30\. When he sees the separate existence of all beings inherent in the
One, and their expansion from That (One) alone, he then becomes Brahman.

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

31\. Being without beginning and devoid of Gunas, this Supreme Self,
immutable, O son of Kunti, though existing in the body neither acts nor
is affected. <span id="fr_296"></span>[31](#fn_296.md)

32\. As the all-pervading Akâsha, because of its subtlety, is not
tainted, so the Self existent in the body everywhere is not tainted.

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

33\. As the one sun illumines all this world, so does He who abides in
the Kshetra, O descendant of Bharata, illumine the whole Kshetra.

34\. They who thus with the eye of knowledge perceive the distinction
between the Kshetra and the Kshetrajna, and also the emancipation from
the Prakriti of beings, they go to the Supreme. <span
id="fr_297"></span>[34](#fn_297.md)

Kshetrajna</span>.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_276"></span>[288:1](sbg18.htm#fr_276.md) This verse is omitted
in many editions.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[289:1](sbg18.htm#fr_277.md) *Kshetra:* Literally,
field; the body is so called because the fruits of action are reaped in
it as in a field.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[290:3](sbg18.htm#fr_278.md) *That:* the true
nature of Kshetra and Kshetrajna in all these specific aspects.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[291:5](sbg18.htm#fr_279.md) The Sânkhyas speak of
those mentioned in the fifth Sloka as the twenty-four Tattvas or
Principles.

*The great Elements*—Mahâbhutas—pervade all Vikâras, or modifications of
matter.

*Aggregate*—Samghâta: combination of the body and the senses. <span
id="page_292">p. 292</span>

Desire and other qualities which the Vaiseshikas speak of as inherent
attributes of the Atman, are spoken of in the sixth Sloka as merely the
attributes of Kshetra, and not the attributes of Kshetrajna. Desire and
other qualities mentioned here, stand for all the qualities of the
Antah-Karana or inner sense,—as mere mental states. Each of them, being
knowable, is Kshetra.

The Kshetra, of which the various modifications in their totality are
spoken of as "this body" in the first Sloka, has been here dwelt upon in
all its different forms, from 'The great Elements' to 'fortitude.'

<span id="fn_280"></span>[292:7](sbg18.htm#fr_280.md) *Achârya*—one who
teaches the means of attaining Moksha.

*Purity*—external and internal. The former consists in washing away the
dirt from the body by means of water &c., and the latter—the purity of
<span id="page_293">p. 293</span> mind—consists in the removal from it
the dirt of attachment and other passions, by the recognition of evil in
all objects of the senses.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[293:8](sbg18.htm#fr_281.md) *Sense-objects:* such
as sound, touch &c., of pleasures seen or unseen.

*Pain*—whether Adhyâtmic, *i.e.*, arising in one's own person, or
Adhibhautic, *i.e.*, produced by external agents, or Adhidaivic, *i.e.*,
produced by supernatural beings.

*Reflection . . . pain*—or the passage may be interpreted as—reflection
on the evils and miseries of birth, death, old age and sickness. Birth
&c., are all miseries, not that they are miseries in themselves, but
because they produce misery. From such reflection arises indifference to
sense-pleasures, and the senses turn towards the Innermost Self for
knowledge.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[294:9](sbg18.htm#fr_282.md) Identification of
self—as in the case of a person who feels happy or miserable when
another to whom he is attached, is happy or miserable, and who feels
himself alive or dead when his beloved one is alive or dead.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[294:10](sbg18.htm#fr_283.md) <span
id="page_295">p. 295</span> *Resort . . . places*—favourable to
equanimity of mind, so that uninterrupted meditation on the Self, . and
the like, may be possible.

*Society of men:* of the unenlightened and undisciplined people, not of
the pure and holy, because association with the latter leads to Jnâna.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[295:11](sbg18.htm#fr_284.md) These
attributes—from 'Humility' to 'Understanding of the end of true
knowledge'—are declared to be knowledge, because they are the means
conducive to knowledge.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[297:15](sbg18.htm#fr_285.md)
*Incomprehensible*—to the unillumined, though knowable in Itself.

*Far*—when unknown.

*Near*—to the illumined, because It is their own Self.

<span id="fn_286"></span>[298:16](sbg18.htm#fr_286.md) *Devouring*—at the
time of Pralaya.

*Generating*—at the time of utpatti or origin of the universe.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[298:17](sbg18.htm#fr_287.md) *The Light even of
lights:*—The illuminator of all illuminating things, such as the sun
&c., and Buddhi &c. Indeed, these latter shine only when illuminated by
the Light of the consciousness of the Self.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[299:19](sbg18.htm#fr_288.md)
*Modifications*—Vikâras: From Buddhi down to the physical body.

<span id="fn_289"></span>[299:20](sbg18.htm#fr_289.md) <span
id="page_300">p. 300</span> *Senses*—five organs of perception, five of
action, mind, intellect and egoism.

*Purusha:* the Jiva is meant here.

*Kârya:* The effect, the physical body. Karana: Senses. Some read
Kârana, and explain 'Kârya and Kârana' as 'effect and cause.'

<span id="fn_290"></span>[300:21](sbg18.htm#fr_290.md) *Seated in:*
identifying himself with.

*Gunas*—manifesting themselves as pleasure, pain and delusion.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[301:22](sbg18.htm#fr_291.md) *Looker-on, the
Permitter*—He himself does not participate in the activities of the
bodily organs, the mind and the Buddhi, being quite apart from them, yet
appears to be so engaged. And being a looker-on, He never stands in the
way of the activities of Prakriti as manifested in the body. Indeed, all
the consciousness or intelligence that manifests itself in the
activities of life is but the reflection of the All-pervading, Absolute
and Perfect Intelligence—the Supreme Spirit.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[301:23](sbg18.htm#fr_292.md) *Whatever his life
&c.:* Whether he be engaged in prescribed or forbidden acts, he is not
born again. For, the acts, the seeds of rebirth, of a knower of <span
id="page_302">p. 302</span> Truth are burnt by the fire of knowledge,
and thus cannot be effective causes to bring about births. In his case
they are mere semblances of Karma; a burnt cloth, for instance, cannot
serve the purposes of a cloth.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[303:25](sbg18.htm#fr_293.md) *Not knowing thus:*
not able to know the Self described above, by one of the several methods
as pointed out.

*From others:* Achâryas or spiritual teachers.

*Regarding*—following with Shraddhâ.

*What they have heard*, *i.e.*, they solely depend upon the authority of
others' instructions.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[303:26](sbg18.htm#fr_294.md) *Union . . .
Kshetrajna:* The union of Kshetra and Kshetrajna, of the object and the
subject, is of the nature of mutual Adhyâsa which consists in
confounding them as well as their attributes with each other, owing to
the absence of discrimination of their real nature. This false knowledge
vanishes when one is able to separate Kshetra from Kshetrajna.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[304:28](sbg18.htm#fr_295.md) *He injures . . . by
self*—like the ignorant man either by ignoring the Self in others
(Avidyâ or nescience), or regarding the non-Self (physical body, &c.) as
the Self (Mithyâ-jnâna or false knowledge)—the two veils that hide the
true nature of the Self.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[306:31](sbg18.htm#fr_296.md) *Being without
beginning*—having no cause.

*Neither . . . affected*—Because the Self is not the doer, therefore He
is not touched by the fruit of action.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[307:34](sbg18.htm#fr_297.md) *Prakriti of
beings:* the material nature or delusion of beings due to Avidyâ.
