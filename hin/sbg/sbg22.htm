<p>Arjuna said:</p>  
<p>1. Those who setting aside the ordinance of the Sh&acirc;stra, perform sacrifice with Shraddh&acirc;, what is their condition, O Krishna? (Is it) Sattva, Rajas or Tamas?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_343"></A><A HREF="#fn_343"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="green">p. 350</font></A></p>  
<p>The Blessed Lord said:</p>  
<p>2. Threefold is the Shraddh&acirc; of the embodied, which is inherent in their nature,&#8212;the S&acirc;ttvika, the R&acirc;jasika and the T&acirc;masika. Do thou hear of it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_344"></A><A HREF="#fn_344"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="green">p. 351</font></A></p>  
<p>3. The Shraddh&acirc; of each is according to his natural disposition, O descendant of Bharata. The man consists of his Shraddh&acirc;; he verily is what his Shraddh&acirc; is.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_345"></A><A HREF="#fn_345"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>4. S&acirc;ttvika men worship the Devas; R&acirc;jasika, the Yakshas and the R&acirc;kshasas; the others&#8212;the T&acirc;masika men&#8212;the Pretas and the hosts of Bhutas.</p>  
<p><a name="page_352"><font size="1" color="green">p. 352</font></A></p>  
<p>5-6. Those men who practise severe austerities not enjoined by the Sh&acirc;stras, given to ostentation and egoism, possessed with the power of lust and attachment, torture, senseless as they are, all the organs in the body, and Me dwelling in the body within; know them to be of Asurika resolve.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_346"></A><A HREF="#fn_346"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="green">p. 353</font></A></p>  
<p>7. The food also which is liked by each of them is threefold, as also Yajna, austerity and almsgiving. Do thou hear this, their distinction.</p>  
<p>8. The foods which augment vitality, energy, strength, health, cheerfulness and appetite, which are savoury and oleaginous, substantial and <A HREF="errata.htm#4">agreeable</A>, are liked by the S&acirc;ttvika.</p>  
<p><a name="page_354"><font size="1" color="green">p. 354</font></A></p>  
<p>9. The foods that are bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, pungent, dry and burning, are liked by the R&acirc;jasika, and are productive of pain, grief and disease.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>10. That which is stale, tasteless, stinking, cooked overnight, refuse and impure, is the food liked by the T&acirc;masika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>[
</p>  
<p><a name="page_355"><font size="1" color="green">p. 355</font></A></p>  
<p>11. That Yajna is S&acirc;ttvika which is performed by men desiring no fruit, as enjoined by ordinance, with their mind fixed on the Yajna only, for its own sake.</p>  
<p>12. That which is performed, O best of the Bh&acirc;ratas, seeking for fruit and for ostentation, know it to be a R&acirc;jasika Yajna.</p>  
<p><a name="page_356"><font size="1" color="green">p. 356</font></A></p>  
<p>13. The Yajna performed without heed to ordinance, in which no food is distributed, which is devoid of Mantras, gifts, and Shraddh&acirc;, is said to be T&acirc;masika.</p>  
<p>14. Worship of the Devas, the twice-born, the Gurus and the wise, purity, straightforwardness, continence, and non-injury are called the austerity of the body.</p>  
<p>15. Speech which causes no vexation, and is true, as also agreeable and beneficial, and regular study of the Vedas,&#8212;</p>  
<p><a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="green">p. 357</font></A></p>  
<p>these are said to form the austerity of speech.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>16. Serenity of mind, kindliness, silence, self-control, honesty of motive,&#8212;this is called the mental austerity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_358"><font size="1" color="green">p. 358</font></A></p>  
<p>17. This threefold austerity practised by steadfast men, with great Shraddh&acirc;, desiring no fruit, is said to be S&acirc;ttvika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>18. That austerity which is practised with the object of gaining welcome, honour and worship, and with ostentation, is here said to be R&acirc;jasika, unstable and transitory.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_359"><font size="1" color="green">p. 359</font></A></p>  
<p>19. That austerity which is practised out of a foolish notion, with self-torture or for the purpose of wining another, is declared to be T&acirc;masika.</p>  
<p>20. To give is right, gift given with this idea, to one who does no service in return, in a fit place and to a worthy person, that gift is held to be S&acirc;ttvika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_360"><font size="1" color="green">p. 360</font></A></p>  
<p>21. And what is given with a view to receiving in return, or looking for the fruit, or again reluctantly, that gift is held to be R&acirc;jasika.</p>  
<p>22. The gift that is given at the wrong place or time, to unworthy persons, without regard or with disdain, that is declared to be T&acirc;masika.</p>  
<p>23. "Om, Tat, Sat": this has been declared to be the triple designation of Brahman. By that were made of old the Br&acirc;hmanas, the Vedas and the Yajnas.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_361"><font size="1" color="green">p. 361</font></A></p>  
<p>24. Therefore, uttering 'Om,' are the acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity as enjoined in the ordinances, always begun by the followers of the Vedas.</p>  
<p>25. Uttering Tat, without aiming at fruits, are the various acts of Yajna, austerity and gift performed by the seekers of Moksha.</p>  
<p><a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="green">p. 362</font></A></p>  
<p>26. The word Sat is used in the sense of reality and of goodness; and so also, P&acirc;rtha, the word Sat is used in the sense of an auspicious act.</p>  
<p>27. Steadiness in Yajna, austerity and gift is also called 'Sat': as also action in connection with these (or, action for the sake of the Lord) is called Sat.</p>  
<p><a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="green">p. 363</font></A></p>  
<p>28. Whatever is sacrificed, given or performed, and whatever austerity is practised without Shraddh&acirc;, it is called Asat, O P&acirc;rtha; it is naught here or hereafter.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A></p>
