### SECTION LIX

"Narada said, 'Rama, the son of Dasaratha, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a
prey to death. His subjects were as much delighted with him, as a sire
is delighted with the children of his loins. Endued with immeasurable
energy, countless virtues were there in him. Of unfading glory, Rama,
the elder brother of Lakshmana, at the command of his father, lived for
fourteen years in the woods, with his wife. That bull among men slew in
Janasthana fourteen thousand *Rakshasas* for the protection of the
ascetics. While dwelling there, the Rakshasa called Ravana, beguiling
both him and his companion (Lakshmana) abducted his wife, the princess
of Videha. Like the Three-eyed (Mahadeva), in days of old, slaying (the
*Asura*) Andhaka, Rama in wrath slew in battle that offender of
Pulastya's race who had never before been vanquished by any foe. Indeed,
the mighty-armed Rama slew in battle that descendant of Pulastya's race
with all his kinsmen and followers, that Rakshasa who was incapable of
being slain by the gods and the *Asuras* together, that wretch who was a
thorn unto the gods and the Brahmanas. In consequence of his
affectionate treatment of his subjects, the celestials worshipped Rama.
Filling the entire earth with his achievements, he was much applauded
even by the celestial *Rishis*. Compassionate unto all creatures, that
king, having acquired diverse realms and protected his subjects
virtuously, performed a great sacrifice without obstruction. And the
lord, Rama, also performed a hundred Horse-sacrifices and the great
sacrifice called *Jaruthya*. And with libations of clarified butter he
contributed to Indra's delight. <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md) And
by these acts of his, Rama conquered hunger and thirst, and all the
diseases to which living creatures are subject. Possessed of every
accomplishment, he always blazed forth with his own energy. Indeed,
Rama, the son of Dasaratha, greatly outshone all creatures. When Rama
ruled his kingdom, the *Rishis*, the gods, and men, all lived together
on the earth. The lives of living creatures were never otherwise. The
life-breaths also, called *Prana*, *Apana*, *Samana*, and the others,
when Rama ruled his kingdom, all performed their functions. All luminous
bodies shone brighter, and calamities never occurred. All his subjects
were long-lived. None died in youth. The dwellers of heaven highly
gratified, used to get, according to (the ordinances of) the four
*Vedas*, libations of clarified butter and other offerings of food made
by men. His realms were free from flies and gnats; and of beasts of prey
and poisonous reptiles, there were none. And none was of unrighteous
tendencies, none was covetous, and none was ignorant. The subjects, of
all the (four) orders, were engaged in righteous and desirable acts,
When the Rakshasas, about this time obstructed the offerings to the
*Pitris* and the worship of the gods in Janasthana, Lord Rama, slaying
them, caused those offerings and that worship to be once more given to
the *Pitris*

and the gods. Men were each blessed with a thousand children, and the
period of their lives was a thousand years. Seniors had never to perform
*Sraddhas* of their juniors. <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md)
Youthful in shape, of a dark-blue hue, of red eyes, possessed of the
tread of an infuriated elephant, with arms reaching down to the knees,
and beautiful and massive, of leonine shoulders, of great strength, and
beloved by all creatures, Rama ruled his kingdom for eleven thousand
years. His subjects always uttered his name. While Rama ruled his
kingdom, the world became extremely beautiful. Taking at last his four
kinds of subjects <span id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97.md) with him Rama went
to heaven, having established his own line consisting of eight houses on
the earth. When even he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in
respect of the four cardinal virtues and superior to thy son, thou
shouldst not lament, saying '*Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya*,' for thy son
who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"

or *havisham udam avahat*, which would mean, he poured libations unto
Indra as copious as water.

pre-deceased their seniors. The causative form of akarayan is a license.

creatures that owned Rama's sway were (1) those that were oviparous, (2)
those that were viviparous, (3) those born of filth, and (4) the
vegetables.
