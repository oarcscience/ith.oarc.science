### SECTION LXXI

"Vyasa said, 'Hearing this sacred history of sixteen kings, capable of
enhancing the period of life (of the listener), king Srinjaya remained
silent without saying anything. The illustrious *Rishi* Narada then said
unto him thus sitting silent, 'O thou of great splendour, hast thou
heard those histories recited by me, and hast thou caught their purport?
Or, are all these lost like *Sraddha* as performed by a person of
regenerate classes having a Sudra wife?' Thus addressed, Srinjaya then
replied with joined hands, 'O thou that hast wealth of asceticism,
having listened to these excellent and praiseworthy histories of ancient
royal sages, all of whom had performed great sacrifices with profuse
presents unto the Brahmanas, my grief hath all been dispelled by wonder,
like the darkness that is dispelled by the rays of the sun. I have now
been cleansed of my sins, and I do not feel any pain now. Tell me, what
shall I do now?'

"Narada said, 'By good luck it is that thy grief hath been dispelled.
Solicit thou the boon that thou desirest. Thou wilt obtain all thou
mayst ask. We never say what is not true.'

"Srinjaya said, 'I am happy with even this, *viz*., that thou, O holy
one, art gratified with me. He with whom thou, O holy one, art
gratified, hath nothing unobtainable here.'

"Narada said, 'I will once more give thee thy son who was fruitlessly
slain by the robbers, like an animal, slaughtered in sacrifice, taking
him out of terrible hell.'

"Vyasa said, 'Then the son of Srinjaya, of wonderful splendour,
appeared, that child resembling the son of Kuvera himself, bestowed by
the gratified *Rishi* (on the bereaved father). And king Srinjaya, once
more meeting with his son, became highly delighted. And he performed
many meritorious sacrifices, giving away profuse sacrificial presents
upon completion. Srinjaya's son had not fulfilled the purposes of his
being. He had performed no sacrifice and had no children. Destitute of
bravery, he

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

had perished miserably and not in battle. It was for this reason that he
could be brought back into life. <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md)
As regards Abhimanyu, he was brave and heroic. He hath fulfilled the
purposes of life, for the brave son of Subhadra, having blasted his foes
by thousands, hath left the world, falling in the field of battle. Those
inaccessible regions that are attainable by *Brahmacharya*, by
knowledge, by acquaintance with the scriptures, by foremost of
sacrifices, even, these have been obtained by thy son. Men of knowledge
always desire heaven by their righteous deeds. They that are living in
heaven never prefer this world to heaven. Therefore, it is not easy for
any desirable thing that might have been unattained by him to bring back
into the world Arjuna's son slain in battle and now residing in heaven.
Thy son has attained to that eternal goal which is attained by *yogins*
with eyes shut in contemplation or by performers of great sacrifices, or
people possessed of great ascetic merit. After death, attaining a new
body that hero is shining like a king in his own immortal rays. Indeed,
Abhimanyu has once more got his own body of lunar essence that is
desirable by all regenerate persons. He deserveth not thy grief. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_123.md) Knowing this, be quiet, and slay thy
foes. Let fortitude be thine. O sinless one, it is the living that stand
in need of our grief, and not they that have attained to heaven. His
sins increase, O king, for whom, the living grieve. Therefore, he that
is wise, abandoning grief, should strive for (the) benefit (of the
dead). The living man should think of the joy, the glory, and the
happiness (of the dead). Knowing this, the wise never indulge in grief,
for grief is painful. Know this to be true. Rise up! Strive (to achieve
thy purpose). Do not grieve. Thou hast heard of the origin of Death, and
her unexampled penances, as also the impartiality of her behaviour
towards all creatures. Thou hast heard that prosperity is unstable. Thou
hast heard how the dead son of Srinjaya was revived. O learned king, do
not grieve. Peace be to thee, I go!'--Having said this, the holy Vyasa
disappeared then and there. Upon the departure of that master of speech,
that foremost of intelligent persons, *viz*., the holy Vyasa, whose
colour was like that of the clouded sky, Yudhishthira, having derived
consolation in consequence of what he had heard about the sacrificial
merit and prosperity of these great monarchs of olden times, possessed
of energy equal to that of the great Indra himself and all of whom had
acquired wealth by righteous means, mentally applauded those illustrious
persons and became freed from grief. Once more, however, with a
melancholy heart he asked himself, saying, 'What shall we say unto
Dhananjaya?'"

*Dwijaidhitam* is certainly better than the Bombay reading *Dwijochitam*
although Nilakantha explains *uchitam* as *abhimatam*.
