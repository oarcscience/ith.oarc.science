### SECTION CXCVIII

"Sanjaya said, 'Hearing these words of Arjuna, the mighty car-warriors
present there said not a single word, O monarch, agreeable or
disagreeable, unto Dhananjaya. Then the mighty-armed Bhimasena, filled
with wrath, O bull of Bharata's race, reproaching Kunti's son, Arjuna,
said these words, 'Thou preachest truths of morality like an anchorite
living in the woods or a Brahmana of rigid vows and senses under
complete control. A person is called a *Kshatriya* because he rescues
others from wounds and injuries. Being such, he must save himself from
wounds and injuries. Showing forgiveness towards the three that are good
(*viz*., the gods, the Brahmanas, and preceptor), a Kshatriya, by doing
his duties, soon wins the earth as also piety and fame and
prosperity. <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) Thou, O perpetuator of
thy race, art endued with every attribute of a Kshatriya. It does not,
therefore, look well for thee to speak like an ignorant wight. O son of
Kunti, thy prowess is like that of Sakra himself, the lord of Sachi.
Thou dost not transgress the bounds of morality like the ocean that
never transgresses its continents. Who is there that would not worship
thee, seeing that thou seekest virtue, having abandoned the wrath
cherished by thee for thirteen years? By good luck, O sire, thy heart
today followeth in the wake of virtue. O thou of unfading glory, by good
luck, thy understanding inclineth towards compassion. Though, however,
thou art inclined to adopt the path of virtue, thy kingdom was snatched
from thee most unrighteously. Dragging the wife Draupadi to the
assembly, thy foes insulted her. Clad in barks of trees and skins of
animals, all of us were exiled to the woods, and though we were
undeserving of that plight, our foes nevertheless compelled us to endure
it for thirteen years. O sinless one, thou hast forgiven all these
circumstances, every one of which demands the exhibition of wrath.
Wedded as thou art to duties of a Kshatriya, thou hast quietly borne
these. Remembering all those acts of unrighteousness, I came here with
thee for avenging myself of them. (When, however, I see that thou art so
indifferent, why), I myself will slay those low wretches that despoiled
us of our kingdom. Thou hadst formerly said these words, *viz*.,
*Addressing ourselves to battle, we will exert to the utmost extent of
our abilities*. Today, however, thou reproachest us. Thou now seekest,
virtue. Those words, therefore, that thou saidst formerly were untrue.
We are already afflicted with fear. Thou cuttest, however, the very core
of our

<span id="page_464">p. 464</span>

hearts with these thy words, O crusher of foes, like one pouring acid
upon the sores of wounded men. Afflicted with thy wordy darts, my heart
is breaking. Thou art virtuous, but thou dost not know in what
righteousness truly consists, since thou applaudest neither thyself nor
us, though all of us are worthy of applause. When
[Kesava](errata.htm#151.md) himself is here, praisest thou the son of
Drona, a warrior that does not come up to even a sixteenth part of
thyself, O Dhanajaya, confessing thy own faults, why dost thou not feel
shame? I can rend asunder this earth in rage, or split the very
mountains in whirling that terrible and heavy mace of mine, decked with
gold. Like the tempest, I can break down gigantic trees looking like
hills. I can, with my arrows, rout the united celestials with Indra at
their head, together with all the *Rakshasas*, O Partha, and the
*Asuras*, the *Uragas* and human beings. Knowing me, thy brother, to be
such, O bull among men, it behoveth thee not, O thou of immeasurable
prowess, to entertain any fear about Drona's son. Or, O Vibhatsu, stand
thou here, with all these bulls amongst men. Alone and unsupported, I
shall, armed with my mace, vanquish this one in great battle.' After
Bhima had ended, the son of the Panchala king, addressing Partha, said
these words, like Hiranyakasipu (the [leader](errata.htm#152.md) of the
*Daityas*) unto the enraged and roaring Vishnu, <span
id="fr_262"></span>[1](#fn_262.md) 'O Vibhatsu, the sages have ordained
these to be the duties of Brahmanas, *viz*., assisting at sacrifices,
teaching, giving away, performance of sacrifices, receiving of gifts,
and study as the sixth. To which of these six was that Drona devoted who
has been stain by me? Fallen off from the duties of his own order and
practising those of the Kshatriya order, that achiever of wicked deeds
used to stay us by means of superhuman weapons. Professing himself to be
a Brahmana, he was in the habit of using irresistible illusion. By an
illusion itself hath he been slain today. O Partha, what is there that
is improper in this? Drona having been thus punished by me, if his son,
from rage, uttereth loud roars, what do you lose by that? I do not think
it at all wonderful that Drona's son, urging the Kauravas to battle,
will cause them to be slain, unable to protect them himself. Thou art
acquainted with morality. Why then dost thou say that I am a slayer of
my preceptor? It was for this that I was born as a son to the king of
the Panchalas, having sprung from the ([sacrificial](errata.htm#153).md)
fire. How, O Dhananjaya, you call him a Brahmana or Kshatriya, with
whom, while engaged in battle, all acts, proper and improper, were the
same? O foremost of men, why should not he be slain, by any means in our
power, who, deprived of his senses in wrath, used to slay with the
*Brahma* weapons even those that were unacquainted with weapons? He that
is unrighteous is said by those that are righteous to be equal to
poison. Knowing this,

<span id="page_465">p. 465</span>

\[paragraph continues\] O thou that art well versed with the truths of
morality, why dost thou, O Arjuna, reproach me? That cruel car-warrior
was seized and slain by me. I have done nothing that is worthy of
reproach. Why then, O Vibhatsu, dost thou not congratulate me? O Partha,
I have cut off that terrible head, like unto the blazing sun or virulent
poison or the all-destroying *Yuga* fire, of Drona. Why then dost thou
not applaud an act that is worthy of applause? He had slain in battle
only my kinsmen and not those of any one else. I say that having only
cut off his head, the fever of my heart hath not abated. The very core
of my heart is being pierced for my not having thrown that head within
the dominion of the *Nishadas*, like that of Jayadratha! <span
id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_263.md) It hath been heard, O Arjuna, that one
incurreth sin by not slaying his foes. Even this is the duty of a
Kshatriya, *viz*., to slay or be slain. Drona was my foe. He hath been
righteously slain by me in battle, O son of Pandu, even as thou hast
slain the brave Bhagadatta, thy friend. Having slain thy grandsire in
battle, thou regardest that act to be righteous. Why then shouldst thou
regard it unrighteous in me for my having slain my wretched foe? In
consequence of our relationship, O Partha, I cannot raise my head in thy
presence and am like a prostrate elephant with a ladder against his body
(for helping puny creatures to get on his back). It, therefore, behoveth
thee not to reproach me. I forgive all the faults of thy speech, O
Arjuna, for the sake of Draupadi and Draupadi's children and not for any
other reason. It is well known that my hostility with the preceptor has
descended from sire to son. All persons in this world know it. Ye sons
of Pandu, are ye not acquainted with it? The eldest son of Pandu hath
not been untruthful in speech. I myself, O Arjuna, am not sinful. The
[wretched](errata.htm#154.md) Drona was a hater of his disciples. Fight
now. Victory will be thine.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_261"></span>[463:1](m07194.htm#fr_261.md) I expand the
original to make the sense clear.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[464:1](m07194.htm#fr_262.md) The first line of
the 23rd verse in the Bengal editions, is made the second line of that
verse in the Bombay text. There seems to be a mistake, however, in both
the texts. Vishnu slew Hiranyakasipu without allowing, the latter to say
anything unto him. Vide *Vishnu Purana*, if instead of *Hiranyakasipu
Harim*, the rendering be *Hiranyakasipu Haris*, the line may then be
connected with Bhima's speech, and the comparison would become more
apposite.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[465:1](m07194.htm#fr_263.md) The *Nishadas* were
and to this day are the lowest caste in India.
