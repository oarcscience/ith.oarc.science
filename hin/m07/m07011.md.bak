### SECTION XI

"Dhritarashtra said, 'Hear, O Sanjaya, the celestial feats of Vasudeva,
feats that Govinda achieved and the like of which no other person hath
ever been able to achieve. Whilst being brought up, O Sanjaya, in the
family of the cowherd (Nanda), that high-souled one, while yet a boy,
made the might of his arms known to the three worlds. Even then he slew
Hayaraja, living in the woods (on the shores) of the Yamuna, who was
equal to (the celestial steed) Uchchaisravas in strength and the wind
itself in speed. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) In childhood, he
also slew with his two bare arms, the *Danava*, in the form of a bull,
of terrible deeds, and risen like Death himself unto all the kine. Of
eyes like the lotus petals, he also slew the mighty *Asuras* named
Pralamva, and Naraka, and Jambha, and Pitha, as also Mura, that terror
of the celestials. And so also Kansa of mighty energy, who was, besides,
protected by Jarasandha, was, with all his followers, slain in battle by
Krishna aided by his prowess alone. <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md)
With Valadeva as his second, that slayer of foes, *viz*., Krishna,
consumed in battle, with all his troops, the king of the Surasenas,
*viz*., Sunaman, of great activity and prowess in battle, the lord of a
full *Akshauhini*, and the valiant second brother of Kansa, the king of
the Bhojas. The highly wrathful regenerate *Rishi* (gratified with the
adoration) gave him boons. <span id="fr_19"></span>[3](#fn_19.md) Of eyes
like the lotus petals, and endued with great bravery, Krishna,
vanquishing all the kings at a self-choice, bore away the daughter of
the king of the Gandharas. Those angry kings, as if they were horses by
birth, were yoked unto his nuptial car and were lacerated with the whip.
The mighty-armed Janardana also caused Jarasandha, the lord of a full
*Akshauhini* of troops, to be slain through the instrumentality of
another. <span id="fr_20"></span>[4](#fn_20.md) The mighty Krishna also
slew the valiant king of Chedis, that leader of kings, as if he were
some animal, on the occasion of the latter's disputing about the
*Arghya*. Putting forth his prowess, Madhava hurled unto the sea the
*Daitya* city called Saubha, (moving) in the skies, protected by Salwa,
and regarded as impregnable. The Angas, the Vangas, the Kalingas, the
Magadhas, the Kasis, the Kosalas, the Vatsyas, the Gargyas, the Karushas
and the Paundras,--all these he vanquished in battle. The Avantis, the
Southerners, the Mountaineers, the Daserakas, the Kasmirakas, the
Aurasikas, the Pisachas, the Samudgalas, the Kamvojas, the Vatadhanas,
the Cholas, the Pandyas, O Sanjaya, the Trigartas, the Malavas, the
Daradas difficult of being vanquished, the Khasas arrived from diverse
realms, as also the Sakas, and the Yavanas with followers, were all
vanquished by him of eyes like

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

lotus-petals. In days of old, penetrating into the very sea, he
vanquished in battle Varuna himself in those watery depths, surrounded
by all kinds of aquatic animals. Slaying in battle (the *Danava* named)
*Panchajanya* living in the depths of *Patala*, Hrishikesa obtained the
celestial conch called *Panchajanya*. The mighty Kesava, accompanied by
Partha, having gratified Agni at Khandava, obtained his invincible
weapon of fire, *viz*., his discus (called *Sudarsana*). Riding on
Vinata's son and frightening (the denizens of) *Amaravati*, the heroic
Krishna brought from Mahendra himself (the celestial flower called)
*Parijata*. Knowing Krishna's prowess, Sakra quietly bore that
act. <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md) We have never heard that there
is any one among the kings who has not been vanquished by Krishna. That
exceedingly wonderful feat also, O Sanjaya, which the lotus-eyed one
performed in my court, who else is capable of performing it? And since,
humbled by devotion, I was suffered to behold Krishna as the Supreme
Lord; everything (about that feat) is well-known to me, myself having
witnessed it with my own eyes, O Sanjaya, the end can never be seen of
the (infinite) achievements of Hrishikesa. of great energy and great
intelligence. Gada, and Samva, and Pradyumna, and Viduratha, and
Charudeshna, and Sarana, and Ulmukha, and Nisatha, and the valiant
Jhilivabhru, and Prithu, and Viprithu, and Samika, and Arimejaya,--these
and other mighty Vrishni heroes, accomplished in smiting, will, standing
on the field of battle, take up their position in the Pandava host, when
summoned by that Vrishni hero, *viz*., the high-souled Kesava.
Everything (on my side) will then be in great danger. Even this is what
I think. And there where Janardana is, there will be the heroic Rama,
equal in strength to ten thousand elephants, resembling the Kailasa
peak, decked with garlands of wild flowers, and armed with the plough.
That Vasudeva, O Sanjaya, whom all the regenerate ones describe as the
Father of all, will that Vasudeva fight for the sake of the Pandavas? O
son, O Sanjaya, if he puts on his armour for the sake of the Pandavas,
there is none amongst us who can be his antagonist. If the Kauravas
happen to vanquish the Pandavas, he, of the Vrishni race, will then, for
the sake of the latter, take up his mighty weapon. And that tiger among
men, that mighty-armed one, slaying then all the kings in battle as also
the Kauravas, will give away the whole earth to Kunti's son. What car
will advance in battle against that car which has Hrishikesa for its
driver and Dhananjaya for its warrior? The Kurus cannot, by any means,
gain victory. Tell me, then everything about how the battle took place.
Arjuna is Kesava's life and Krishna is always victory; in Krishna is
always fame. In all the worlds, Vibhatsu is invincible. In Kesava are
infinite merits in excess. The foolish Duryodhana, who doth not know
Krishna or Kesava, seems, through Destiny, to have Death's noose before
him. Alas, Duryodhana knows not Krishna of Dasarha's race and Arjuna the
son of Pandu. These high-souled ones are ancient gods. They are even
Nara and Narayana. On earth they

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

are seen by men as; two separate forms, though in reality they are both
possessed but by one soul. With the mind alone, that invincible pair, of
world-wide fame, can, if only they wish it, destroy this host. Only, in
consequence of their humanity they do not wish it. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) Like a change of the *Yuga*, the death of
Bhishma, O child, and the slaughter of the high-souled Drona, overturn
the senses. Indeed, neither by Brahmacharya, nor by the study of the
*Vedas*, nor by (religious) rites, nor by weapons, can any one prevent
death. Hearing of the slaughter of Bhishma and Drona, those heroes
accomplished in weapons, respected by all the worlds, and invincible in
battle, why O Sanjaya, do I yet live? In consequence of the death of
Bhishma and Drona, O Sanjaya, we will henceforth have to live as
dependants on that prosperity beholding which in Yudhishthira we had
before been so jealous. Indeed, this destruction of the Kurus hath come
in consequence only of my acts. O *Suta*, in killing these that are ripe
for destruction, the very straw becomes thunderbolt. That prosperity is
without end in this; world which Yudhishthira is about to
obtain--Yudhishthira through whose wrath both Bhishma and Drona have
fallen. In consequence of his very disposition, hath Righteousness gone
over to the side of Yudhishthira, while it is hostile to my son. Alas,
time, so cruel, that hath now come for the destruction of all,
[cannot](errata.htm#4.md) be overcome. Things calculated in one way, O son,
even by men of intelligence, become otherwise through Destiny. This is
what I think. Therefore, tell me everything that has taken place during
the progress of this unavoidable and dreadful calamity productive of the
most sorrowful reflection incapable of being crossed over (by us).'"
