### SECTION LVII

"Narada said, 'The heroic king Paurava also, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a
prey to death. That king gave away a thousand times thousand horses that
were all white in hue. At the Horse-sacrifice performed by that royal
sage, countless number of learned Brahmanas versed in the principles of
*Siksha* <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) and *Akshara* come from
diverse realms. These Brahmanas, purified by the Vedas, by knowledge,
and by vows, and liberal and of agreeable countenances, having obtained
from the king costly gifts, such as, robes and houses and excellent beds
and carpets and vehicles and draft-cattle, were always delighted by
actors and dancers and singers, thoroughly competent and well-versed (in
their respective art), engaged in spot and ever-striving for their
diversion. At each of his Sacrifices in due time he gave away as
sacrificial presents ten thousand elephants of golden splendour, with
the temporal juice trickling down their bodies, and cars made of gold
with standards and banners. He also gave away, as sacrificial presents,
a thousand times thousand maidens decked with ornaments of gold, and
cars and steeds and elephants for mounting, and houses and fields, and
hundreds of kine, by hundreds of thousand, and thousands of cowherds
decked with gold. They that are acquainted with the history of the past,
sing this song, *viz*., that in that sacrifice, king Paurava gave away
kine with calves, having golden horns and silver hoofs and brass
milkpots, and female slaves and male slaves and asses and camels, and
sheep, countless in number, and diverse kinds of gems and diverse
hill-like [mounds](errata.htm#38.md) of food. That sacrificing king of the
Angas successively performed, in the order of their merit, and according
to what was competent for his own class, many auspicious sacrifices
capable of yielding every object of desire. When such a king, O
Srinjaya, died who was superior to thee as regards the four cardinal
virtues and who, superior to thee was, therefore, much more superior to
thy son, thou shouldst not, saying '*Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya*,' grieve
for thy son who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial
present.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_93"></span>[119:1](m07054.htm#fr_93.md) *Siksha*, one of the
six branches of Vedas; it may be called the orthoepy of the Vedas.
*Akshara*, letters of the alphabet. The sense seems to be that these
Brahmanas were good readers of the Vedas.
