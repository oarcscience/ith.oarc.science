### SECTION CLI

"Sanjaya said, 'Thus urged by Drona, king Duryodhana, filled with rage
set his heart on battle. And thy son, Duryodhana, then said unto Karna,
'Behold, the diadem-decked son of Pandu, with Krishna alone for
helpmate, penetrated into the array formed by the preceptor, an array
that the gods themselves could not pierce, and in the very sight of the
illustrious Drona struggling in battle and of many other foremost of
warriors, slew the ruler of the Sindhus. Behold, O son of Radha, many
foremost of kings lying on the earth, slain in battle. Partha unaided by
any one, in the very sight of the illustrious Drona and myself,
vigorously exerting ourselves like a host of inferior animals-slain by a
lion. The son of Sakra hath reduced my host to a small remnant of what
it was. How, indeed, could Phalguna, in spite of the resistance offered
by Drona in battle, accomplish his vow by slaying the ruler of the
Sindhus? If Drona had not himself willed it, O hero, how could the son
of Pandu, in battle, have pierced that impenetrable array, overcoming
his struggling preceptor? Truly, Phalguna is exceedingly dear to the
illustrious preceptor! For this, the latter gave him admittance, without
having fought with him. Behold my misfortune! Having in the first
instance promised protection unto the ruler of the Sindhus, Drona, that
scorcher of foes, gave unto the diadem-decked Arjuna admittance into the
array! If he had in the beginning granted permission to the ruler of the
Sindhus for his return home, without doubt, such an awful carnage would
then have never occurred. Alas! Jayadratha, in hopes of saving his life,
had desired to return home. Having obtained from Drona a promise of
protection in battle, it was I, a fool that I was, who prevented him
from going. Alas, today my brothers having Chitrasena for their head,
have all perished in the very sight of our wretched selves.' <span

"Karna said, 'Do not blame the preceptor. That Brahmana is fighting
according to the measure of his power and courage and regardless of his
very life. If Arjuna, of white steeds, having transgressed him,
penetrated into our array, the slightest fault does not, for that,
attach to the preceptor. Phalguna is accomplished in weapons, possessed
of great activity, endued with youth; he is a hero who has mastered all
arms; he is distinguished for the celerity of his movements. Armed with
celestial weapons and mounted on his ape-bannered car, the reins of
whose steeds again were in the hands of Krishna, cased in impenetrable
armour, and taking his celestial bow *Gandiva* of unfading might, the
valiant Arjuna, scattering keen arrows, and proud of the strength of his
arms, transgressed Drona. There is nothing to wonder at this. The
preceptor, on the other hand is, O king, old and incapable of proceeding
quickly. He is also, O king, incapable of exercising his arms long. It
was for this that Phalguna, of

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

white steeds and having Krishna for his charioteer, succeeded in
transgressing the preceptor. For this reason also, I do not see any
fault in Drona. For all that, when Arjuna, of white steeds, penetrated
into our array, having transgressed the preceptor it seems that the
latter, however skilled in weapons, is incapable of vanquishing the
Pandavas in battle. I think that which is ordained by Fate never occurs
otherwise. And since, O Suyodhana, in spite of ourselves fighting to the
utmost extent of our powers, the ruler of the Sindhus has been slain in
battle, it seems that Fate is all-powerful. With thyself we had all been
exerting to the utmost of our might on the field of battle. Fate,
however, baffling our exertions, did not smile on us. We have always
exerted to injure the Pandavas, relying both on deceit and prowess.
Whatever act, O king, a person afflicted by Fate does, is frustrated by
Fate, however, much the person himself may strive to achieve it.
Whatever, indeed, a man endued with perseverance should do, ought to be
done fearlessly. Success depends on Fate! By deceit the sons of Pritha
were beguiled as also by the administration of poison, O Bharata! Burnt
they were in the palace of lac, vanquished they were at dice. In
accordance with the dictates of statecraft, they were exited into the
woods. All these, though done by us with care, have been baffled by
Fate. Fight with resolution, O king, setting Fate at nought. Between
thee and them, both striving to the best of your prowess even Fate may
prove auspicious to that party which excels the other. <span
id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_187.md) No wise measures have been adopted by
the Pandavas with the aid of superior intelligence. Nor, O hero, do we
see, O perpetuator of Kuru's race, that thou hast done anything unwise
from want of intelligence! It is Fate that decides the result of acts,
wise or unwise; Fate, ever intent on its own purposes is awake when all
else sleeps. Vast was thy host, and thy warriors are many. Even thus the
battle began. With their small force, much greater and consisting of men
capable of smiting effectually, hath been much reduced. I fear, it is
the work of Fate, that has frustrated our exertions.'

"Sanjaya continued, 'While they were discoursing thus, O king, the
Pandava divisions appeared for battle. Then occurred a fierce battle
between thy warriors and theirs, in which cars and elephants encountered
one another. All this, however, O king, was due to thy evil policy!'"
