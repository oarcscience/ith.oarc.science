### SECTION LXI

"Narada said, 'Dilipa, the son of Havila, too, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell
a prey to death. Brahmanas, vested in knowledge of Truth, devoted to the
performance of sacrifices, blessed with children and children's children
and numbering myriads upon myriads, were present at his hundreds of
sacrifices. King Dilipa, having performed various sacrifices, gave away
this earth, filled with treasures, unto the Brahmanas. At the sacrifices
of Dilipa, the roads were all made of gold. The very gods, with Indra at
their head used to come to him regarding him as *Dharma* himself. The
upper and lower rings of his sacrificial stake were made of gold. Eating

his *Raga-khandavas*, many persons, at his sacrifices, were seen to lie
down on the roads. While battling over the waters, the two wheels of
Dilipa's car never sank in that liquid. This seemed exceedingly
wonderful, and never occured to other kings, Even those that saw king
Dilipa, that firm bowman, always truthful in speech and giving away
profuse gifts at his sacrifices, succeeded in ascending to heaven. In
the abode of Dilipa, called also Khattanga, these five sounds were
always to be heard, *viz*., the sound of *Vedic* recitations, the twang
of bows, and *Drink*, *Enjoy*, and *Eat*! When he died, O Srinjaya, who
was superior to thee in respect of the four cardinal virtues and who
superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, thou shouldst not,
saying, '*Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya*,' grieve for thy son who performed
no sacrifice and made no sacrificial gifts.'" <span
