### SECTION CXXII

"Sanjaya said, 'Meanwhile, O king, Duhsasana rushed against the grandson
of Sini, scattering thousands of shafts like a mighty cloud pouring
torrents of rain. Having pierced Satyaki with sixty arrows and once more
with sixteen, he failed to make that hero tremble, for the latter stood
it, battle, immovable as the Mainaka mountain. Accompanied by a large
throng of cars hailing from diverse realms, that foremost one of
Bharata's

race shot numberless arrows, and filled all the points of the compass
with roars deep as those of the clouds. Beholding the Kaurava coming to
battle, Satyaki of mighty arms rushed towards him and shrouded him with
his shafts. They that were at the van of Duhsasana, thus covered with
those arrowy showers, all fled away in fear, in the very sight of thy
son. After they had fled away, O monarch, thy son Duhsasana, O king,
remained fearlessly in battle and began to afflict Satyaki with arrows.
And piercing the four steeds of Satyaki with four arrows, his charioteer
with three, and Satyaki himself with a hundred in that battle, Duhsasana
uttered a loud roar, Then, O monarch, Madhava, inflamed with rage, soon
made Duhsasana's car and driver and standard and Duhsasana himself
invisible by means of his straight arrows. Indeed, Satyaki entirely
shrouded the brave Duhsasana with arrows. Like a spider entangling a
gnat within reach by means of its threads, that vanquisher of foes
quickly covered Duhsasana with his shafts. Then King Duryodhana, seeing
Duhsasana thus covered with arrows, urged a body of Trigartas towards
the car of Yuyudhana. Those Trigarta car-warriors, of fierce deeds,
accomplished in battle, and numbering three thousand, proceeded towards
Yuyudhana. Firmly resolved upon battle and swearing not to retreat, all
of them encompassed Yuyudhana with a large throng of cars, Soon,
however, Yuyudhana struck down five hundred of their foremost warriors
stationed in the van of the force as it advanced towards him in battle,
shooting showers of arrows at him. Speedily slain by that foremost one
amongst the Sinis with his shafts, these fell down, like tall trees from
mountain-tops uprooted by a tempest. And the field of battle, strewn
with mangled elephants, O monarch, and fallen standards, and bodies of
steeds decked in trappings of gold, and torn and lacerated with the
shafts of Sini's grandson and weltering in blood, looked beautiful, O
king, like a plain overgrown with flowering *Kinsukas*. Those soldiers
of thine, thus slaughtered by Yuyudhana, failed to find a protector like
elephants sunk in a morass. Then all of them turned towards the spot
where Drona's car was, like mighty snakes making towards holes from fear
of the prince of birds. Having slain those five hundred brave warriors
by in means of his shafts, resembling snakes of virulent poison, that
hero slowly proceeded towards the place where Dhananjaya was. And as
that foremost of men was thus proceeding thy son Duhsasana quickly
pierced him with nine straight arrows. That mighty bowman then
(Yuyudhana), pierced Duhsasana, in return, with five straight and sharp
arrows equipped with golden wings and vulturine feather. Then Duhsasana,
O Bharata, smiling the while, pierced Satyaki, O monarch, with three
arrows, and once more with five. The grandson of Sini, then, striking
thy Son with five arrows and Cutting off his bow proceeded smilingly
towards Arjuna. Then Duhsasana, inflamed with wrath and desirous of
slaying the Vrishni hero, hurled at him, as he proceeded, a dart made
wholly of iron. Satyaki, however, O king, cut off, with his shafts,
equipped with *Kanka* feathers, that fierce dart Of thy son. Then, O
ruler of men, then, thy son, taking up another bow,

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

pierced Satyaki with some arrows and uttered a loud roar. Then Satyaki
excited with wrath, stupefying thy son in that battle, struck him in the
centre of the chest with some shafts that resembled flames of fire. And
once more, he pierced Duhsasana with eight shafts made wholly of iron
and having very keen points. Duhsasana, however, pierced Satyaki in
return with twenty arrows. Then, the highly-blessed Satyaki, O monarch,
pierced Duhsasana in the centre of the chest with three straight arrows.
And the mighty car-warrior Yuyudhana, with some straight shafts slew the
steeds of Duhsasana; inflamed with wrath he slew, with some straight
arrows, that the latter's charioteer also. With one broad-headed arrow
he then cut off thy son's bow, and with five arrows he cut the leathern
fence that encased his hand. Acquainted as he was with highest weapons,
Satyaki, then, with a couple of broad-headed shafts, cut off Duhsasana's
standard and the wooden shafts of his car. And then with a number of
keen arrows he slew both the *Parshni* charioteers of thy son. The
latter, then, bowless and carless and steedless and driverless, was
taken up by the leader of the Trigarta warriors on his car. The grandson
of Sini, then, O Bharata, pursuing him a moment, restrained himself and
slew him not, for the mighty-armed hero recollected the words of
Bhimasena. Indeed, Bhimasena, O Bharata, vowed in the midst of the
assembly the destruction of all thy sons in battle. Then, O lord,
Satyaki, having thus vanquished Duhsasana, quickly proceeded, O king,
along the track by which Dhananjaya had gone before him.'"
