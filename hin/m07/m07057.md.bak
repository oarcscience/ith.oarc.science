### SECTION LX

"Narada said, 'Even king Bhagiratha, O Srinjaya, we hear, was dead. He
caused the shores of Ganga, called after his name *Bhagirath* to be
covered with flights of steps made of gold. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[3](#fn_98.md) Surpassing all kings and all princes, he
gave unto the Brahmanas a thousand times thousand damsels decked with
ornaments of gold. All those damsels were upon cars. And unto every car
were yoked four steeds, and behind each car were a hundred kine. And
behind each cow were (many) goats and sheep. King Bhagiratha gave
enormous presents at his sacrifices. For that reason a large concourse
of men assembled there. Afflicted there with Ganga was much pained.
'*Protect Me*,' she said and sat down on his lap. And because Ganga thus
sat upon his lap in days of old, therefore, she, like the celestial
*dancer* Urvasi came to be regarded as his daughter and was named after
his name. And having become the king's daughter, she became his son (by
becoming like a son, the means of salvation unto his deceased

ancestors). <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99.md) Sweet-speeched
*Gandharvas* of celestial splendour, gratified, sang all this in the
hearing of the *Rishis*, the gods, and human beings. <span
id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_100.md) Thus, O Srinjaya, did that goddess,
*viz*., the ocean-going Ganga, select lord Bhagiratha, descendant of
Ikshvaku, the performer of sacrifices with profuse gifts (to the
Brahmanas), as her father. His sacrifices were always graced with (the
presence of) the very gods with Indra at their head. And the gods used
to take their respective shares, by removing all impediments, to
facilitate those sacrifices in every way. Possessed of great ascetic
merit, Bhagiratha gave unto the Brahmanas whatever benefit they desired
without obliging them to stir from the place wherever they might
entertain those desires. There was nothing which he could withhold from
the Brahmanas. Every one received from him everything he coveted. At
last, the king ascended to the region of Brahman, through the grace of
the Brahmanas. For that object on which the *Rishis* that subsisted on
the rays of the sun used to wait upon the sun and the presiding deity of
the sun, for that very object they used to wait upon the lord
Bhagiratha, that ornament of the three worlds. When he died, O Srinjaya,
who was superior to thee, as regards the four cardinal virtues, and who,
superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, thou shouldst not
grieve, saying '*Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya*,' for the latter who
performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial present.'"

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_98"></span>[122:3](m07057.htm#fr_98.md) These were *ghats* for
facilitating access to the sacred stream.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[123:1](m07057.htm#fr_99.md) Both 5 and 6 are
difficult *slokas*. But for Nilakantha I could never have understood
their sense. The reading *Jalaughena*, occuring in both the Bengal and
the Bombay editions, is a mistake for *Janaughena*. The construction of
5 is this: *Dakshina Bhuyasirdadat: tena hetuna Janaughena akaranta*.
The story of the salvation of Bhagiratha's ancestors is a beautiful
myth. King Sagara (whence Sagara or the Ocean) had sixty thousand sons.
They were all reduced to ashes by the curse of the sage Kapila, an
incarnation of Vishnu himself. Bhagiratha, a remote descendant, caused
the sacred Ganga to roll over the spot where the ashes of his ancestors
lay, and thus procured their salvation.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[123:2](m07057.htm#fr_100.md) The correct reading
is Valguvadinas, and not the form in the [genitive](errata.htm#39.md)
plural.
