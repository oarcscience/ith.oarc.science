# CHANDRA'S VENGEANCE.

<span id="img_46"></span> ![](img/46.jpg)

THERE was once a Sowkar's  <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) wife who
had no children. One day she went crying to her husband and saying,
'What an unhappy woman I am to have no children! If! had any children to
amuse me I should be quite happy.' He answered, 'Why should you be
miserable on that account? though you have no children, your sister has
eight or nine; why not adopt one of hers?' The Sowkar's wife agreed; and
adopting one of her sister's little boys, who was only six months old,
brought him up as her own son. Some time afterwards, when the child was
one day returning from school, he and one of his school-fellows
quarrelled and began to fight, and the other boy (being much the older
and stronger of the two) gave him a great blow on the head and knocked
him down, and hurt him very much. The boy ran crying home, and the
Sowkar's wife bathed his head and bandaged it up, but she did not send
and punish the boy who hurt him, for she thought, 'One can't keep
children shut up always in the house, and they will be fighting together
sometimes and hurting themselves.' Then the child grumbled to himself,
saying, 'This is only my aunt; that is why she did not punish the other
boy. If she had been my mother she would certainly have given him a
great knock on his head, to punish him for knocking mine, but because
she is only my aunt, I suppose she doesn't care.' The Sowkar's wife
overheard him, and felt very grieved, saying, 'This little child, whom I
have watched over from his babyhood, does not love me as if I were his
mother. It is of no use; he is not my own, and he will never care for me
as such.' So she took him home to his own mother, saying, 'Sister, I
have brought you back your child.'--'How is this?' asked her sister;
'you adopted him as yours for all his life. Why do you now bring him
back?' The Sowkar's wife did not tell her sister what she had heard the
boy say, but she answered, 'Very well, let him be yours and mine; he
shail live a while with you, and then come and visit me; we will both
take care of him.' And, returning to her husband, she told him what she
had done, saying, 'All my pains are useless; you know how kind I have
been to my sister's boy, yet, after all I have done for him, at the end
of seven years he does not love me as well as he does his mother, whom
he has scarcely seen. Now, therefore, I will never rest until I have
seen Mahadeo,  <span id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_80.md) and ask him to grant
that I may have a child of my own.'  <span id="fr_81"></span>[3](#fn_81.md)

'What a foolish woman you are!' answered her husband; 'why not be
content with your lot? How do you think you will find Mahadeo? Do you
know the road to heaven?'--' Nay,' she replied, 'but I will seek for it
until I find it out, and if I never find it, it cannot be helped, but I
will return home no more unless my prayer is answered.' So she left the
house, and wandered into the jungle, and after she had travelled through
it for many, many days and left her own land very far behind, she came
to the borders of another country, even the Madura Tinivelly  <span
id="fr_82"></span>[4](#fn_82.md) country, where a great river rolled down
towards the sea. On the river-bank sat two women--a Ranee named
Coplinghee Ranee, and a Nautch woman.

Now, neither the Ranee, the Nautch woman, nor the Sowkar's wife had ever
seen each other before they met at the river-side. Then, as she sat down
to rest and drink some of the water, the Ranee turned to the Sowkar's
wife, and said to her, 'Who are you, and where are you going?' She
answered, 'I am a Sowkar's Wife from a far country, and because I was
very unhappy at having r children, I am going to find Mahadeo and ask
him to grant that may have a child of my own.'

Then, in her turn, she said to the Ranee, 'And pray who are you, and
where are you going?' The Ranee answered, 'I am Coplinghee Ranee, queen
of all this country, but neither money nor riches can give me joy, for I
have no children; I therefore am going to seek Mahadeo and ask him to
grant that I may have child.' Then Coplinghee Ranee asked the Nautch
woman the same question, saying, 'And who may you be, and where are ye
going?' The Nautch woman answered, 'I am a dancing-woman and I also have
no children, and am going to seek Mahadeo an pray to him for a child.'
At hearing this, the Sowkar's wife said 'Since we are all journeying on
the same errand, why should we not go together?' To this Coplinghee
Ranee and the Dancing woman agreed, so they all three continued their
journey together through the jungle.

On, on, on they went, every day further and further; they never stayed
to rest, nor saw another human being. Their feet ached dreadfully, and
their clothes wore out, and they had nothing to live on but the
jungle-plants, wild berries and seeds. So weary and worn did they become
that they looked like three poor old beggar-women. Never had they by
night-time sleep, nor by day time rest; and so, hour after hour, month
after month, year after year, they travelled on.

At last, one day, they came to where, in the midst of the jungle there
rolled a great river of fire. It was the biggest river they ha ever
seen, and made of flames instead of water. There was no one on this side
and no one on that; no way of getting across but but walking through the
fire.

When Coplinghee Ranee and the Nautch woman saw this, the said, 'Alas!
here is the end of all our pains and trouble. All hop is over, for we
can go no further.' But the Sowkar's wife answere 'Shall we be deterred
by this, after having come so far? Nay, rather seek a way across the
fire.' And, so saying, she stepped into the fire waves; the others,
however, were afraid, and would not go. When the Sowkar's wife had half
crossed the river of fir she turned, and waving her hands towards them,
said, 'Come on come on! do not be afraid. The fire does not burn me. I
go find Mahadeo; perhaps he is but the other side.'  <span
id="fr_83"></span>[5](#fn_83.md) But they still refused, saying, 'We cannot
come, but we will wait here until you return; and if you find Mahadeo,
pray for us also, that we may have children.'

So the Sowkar's wife went on her way, and the fire waves lapped round
her feet as if they had been water, but they did not hurt her.

When she reached the other side of the river she came upon a great
wilderness, full of wild elephants, and of bison, and lions, and tigers,
and bears, that roared and growled on every side. But she did not turn
back for fear of them, for she said to herself, 'I can but die once, and
it is better that they should kill me, than that I should return without
finding Mahadeo.' And all the wild beasts allowed her to pass through
the midst of them and did her no harm.

Now it came to pass that Mahadeo looked down from heaven and saw her,
and when he saw her he pitied her greatly, for she had been twelve years
wandering upon the face of the earth to find him. Then he caused a
beautiful mango-tree, beside a fair well, to spring up in the desert to
give her rest and refreshment, and he himself in the disguise of a
Gosain Fakeer,  <span id="fr_84"></span>[6](#fn_84.md) came and stood by
the tree. But the Sowkar's wife would not stay to gather the fruit or
drink the water; she did not so much as notice the Fakeer, but walked
straight on, in her weary search for Mahadeo. Then he called after her,
'Bai, Bai, where are you going? Come here.' She answered, scarcely
looking at him, 'It matters not to you, Fakeer, where I am going. You
tell your prayer-beads, and leave me alone.'--'Come here,' he cried;
'come here!' But she would not, so Mahadeo went and stood in front of
her, no longer disguised as a Fakeer, but shining brightly, the Lord of
Kylas  <span id="fr_85"></span>[7](#fn_85.md) in all his beauty, and at the
sight of him the poor Sowkar's wife fell down on the ground and kissed
his feet; and he said to her, 'Tell me, Bai, where are you going?' She
answered, 'Sir, I seek Mahadeo, to pray him to grant that I may have a
child, but for twelve years I have looked for him in vain.' He said,
'Seek no further, for I am Mahadeo; take this mango,' and he gathered
one off the tree that grew by the well, 'and eat it, and it shall come
to pass that when you return home you shall have a child.' Then she
said, 'Sir, three women came seeking you, but two stayed by the river of
fire, for they were afraid; may not they also have children?'

'If you will,' he answered, 'you may give them some of your mango, and
then they also will each have a child.'

So saying, he faded from her sight, and the Sowkar's wife returned, glad
and joyful, through the wilderness and the river of fire, to where the
Ranee and the Dancing-woman were waiting for her on the other side. When
they saw her, they said, 'Well, Sowkar's wife, what news?' She answered,
'I have found Mahadeo, and he has given me this mango, of which if we
eat we shall each have a child.' And she took the mango, and squeezing
it, gave the juice to the Ranee, and the skin she gave to the Nautch
woman, and the pulp and the stone she ate herself.

Then these three women returned to their own homes; Coplinghee Ranee and
the Dancing-woman to the Madura Tinivelly country, and the Sowkar's wife
to very, very far beyond that, even the land where her husband lived,
and whence she had first started on her journey.

But, on their return, all their friends only laughed at them, and the
Sowkar said to his wife, 'I cannot see much good in your mad twelve
years' journey; you only come back looking like a beggar, and all the
world laughs at you.'--'I don't care,' she answered; 'I have seen
Mahadeo, and eaten of the mango, and I shall have a child.' And within a
while it came to pass that there was born to the Sowkar and his wife a
little son, and on the very same day Coplinghee Ranee had a daughter,
and the Nautch woman had a daughter.

Then were they all very happy, and sent everywhere to tell their friends
the good news; and each gave, according to her power, a great feast to
the poor, as a thank-offering to Mahadeo, who had been merciful to them.
And the Sowkar's wife called her son 'Koila,'  <span
id="fr_86"></span>[8](#fn_86.md) in memory of the mango stone; and the
Nautch woman called her daughter 'Moulee;  <span
id="fr_87"></span>[9](#fn_87.md) and the little Princess was named Chandra
Bai,  <span id="fr_88"></span>[10](#fn_88.md) for she was as fair and
beautiful as the white moon.

Chandra Ranee was very beautiful, the most beautiful child in all that
country, so pretty and delicately made that everybody, when they saw
her, loved her. She was born, moreover, with, on her ankles, two of the
most costly anklets that ever were seen. They were made of gold and very
precious stones, dazzling to look at, like the sun. No one had ever seen
any like them before.

Every day as the baby grew, these bangles grew, and round them were
little bells, which tinkled when any one came near. Chandra's parents
were very happy and proud, and sent for all the wise men in the kingdom
to tell her fortune. But the most learned of the Brahmans, when he saw
her, said, 'This child must be sent out of the country at once, for if
she stays in it she will destroy all the land with fire, and burn it
utterly.'

The Rajah, at hearing these words, was very angry, and said to the
Brahman, 'I will cut off your head, for you tell lies and not the
truth.' The Brahman answered, 'Cut off my head if you will, but it is
the truth I speak, and no lie. If you do not believe me, let a little
wool be fetched, and put it upon the child, that you may know my words
are true.'

So they fetched some wool and laid it upon the baby, and no sooner had
they done so, than it all blazed up and burned till not a bit was left,
and it scorched the hands of the attendants.

Then the Brahman said, 'As this fire has burned the wool, so will this
Princess one day, if she comes here, burn this whole land.  <span
id="fr_89"></span>[11](#fn_89.md) And they were all very much frightened,
and the Rajah said to the Ranee, 'This being so, the child must be sent
out of the country instantly.' The poor Ranee thereat was very sad, and
she did -all in her power to save her little baby, but the Rajah would
not hear of it, and commanded that the Princess should be placed in a
large box, and taken to the borders of his land, where a great river
rolled down to the sea, and there thrown into the stream, that it might
carry her far, far away, each minute further from her native land.' Then
the Ranee caused a beautiful golden box to be made, and put her little
baby in it, with many tears (since all her efforts to save it were of no
avail), and it was taken away and thrown into the river.

The box floated on, and on, and on, until at last it reached the country
where the Sowkar and the Sowkar's wife lived. Now it chanced that,just
as the box was floating by, the Sowkar, who had gone down to the river
to wash his face, caught sight of it, and seeing a fisherman, not far
off, prepared to throw his net into the water, he cried, 'Run,
Fisherman, run, run, do not stop to fish, but cast your net over that
glittering box and bring it here to me.'

'I will not, unless you promise me that the box shall be mine,' said the
Fisherman. 'Very well,' answered the Sowkar; 'the box shall be yours,
and whatever it contains shall belong to me.'

So the Fisherman cast his net in that part of the river, and dragged the
box ashore.

I don't know which was most astonished, the Merchant or the Fisherman,
when they saw what a prize they had found. For the box was composed
entirely of gold and precious stones, and within it lay the most lovely
little child that ever was seen.

She seemed a little Princess, for her dress was all made of cloth of
gold, and on her feet were two anklets that shone like the sun.

When the Sowkar opened the box, she smiled, and stretched out her little
arms towards him. Then he was pleased, and said, 'Fisherman, the box is
yours, but this child must belong to me.' The Fisherman was content that
it should be so, for he had many children of his own at home, and wanted
no more, but was glad to have the golden box; while the Sowkar, who had
only his one little son, and was rich, did not care for the box, but was
well pleased to have the baby.

He took her home to his wife, and said, 'See, wife, here is a pretty
little daughter-in-law for us. Here is a wife for your little son.' And
when the Sowkar's wife saw the child looking so beautiful and smiling so
sweetly, her heart was glad, and she loved her, and from that day took
the greatest care of her, just as if the baby-girl had been her own
daughter. And when Chandra Ranee was a year old, they married her to
their son, Koila.

Years wore on, and the Sowkar and his wife were in a good old age
gathered to their fathers. Meantime, Koila and Chandra had grown up the
handsomest couple in all the country: Koila tall and straight, with a
face like a young lion, and Chandra as lithe and graceful as a
palm-tree, with a face calm and beautiful like the silver moonlight.

Meantime, 'Moulee,' the Nautch woman's daughter (and third of the mango
children), had likewise grown up, in the Madura Tinivelly country, and
was also very fair, fairer than any one in all the land around.
Moreover, she danced and sang more beautifully than any of the other
Nautch girls. Her voice was clear as the voice of a quail, and it rang
through the air with such power that the sound could be heard a
twelve-days' journey off. The Nautch people used to travel about from
place to place, staying one day in one town and the next in another, and
so it happened that in their wanderings they reached the borders of the
land where Koila and Chandra lived.

One morning Koila heard the sound of singing in the distance, and it
pleased him so well that he determined to try and discover who it was
that possessed such an exquisite voice. For twelve days he journeyed on
through the jungle, each day hearing the singing repeated louder and
louder, yet still without reaching the place whence it came. At last, on
the twelfth day, he got close to the Nautch people's encampment, not far
from a large town, and there saw the singer (who was none other than
Moulee), singing and dancing in the midst of a great crowd of people who
had collected around her. In her hand she held a garland of flowers,
which she waved over her head as she danced.

Koila was so charmed with the sound of her voice that he felt
spell-bound, and stood where he was, far off on the outskirts of the
jungle, listening, without going any nearer.

When the entertainment was over, all the people crowded round Moulee,
saying, 'Why should you, who have such a beautiful voice, go away and
leave our city? Marry one of us, and then you will stay here always.'
Then, the number of her suitors being so great that she did not know
whom to choose, she said, 'Very well, he on whose neck this garland
falls shall be my husband.' And waving the flowers she held two or three
times round her head, she threw them from her with her utmost force.

The impetus given to the garland was so great that it swang through the
air beyond the crowd and fell upon the neck of Koila as he stood by the
borders of the jungle. All the people ran to see who was the fortunate
possessor, and when they saw Koila they were astonished, for he looked
more beautiful than any of the sons of men; it was as if an Immortal had
suddenly come among them. And the Nautch people dragged him back to
their camp, crying, 'You have won the garland; you must be Moulee's
husband.' He answered, 'I only came here to look on; I cannot stay. This
is not my country; I have a wife of my own at home.'--'That is nothing
to us,' they said; 'it is your destiny to marry Moulee,--Moulee the
beautiful one, Moulee whose voice you heard, and who dances so well. You
must marry her, for the garland fell on you'

Now so it was, that though Koila was very kind to his wife, he did not
love her as well as she loved him (perhaps it was that having been
accustomed to her from a child, Chandra's goodness and beauty struck him
less than it did other people), and instead of thinking how unhappy she
would be if he did not return, and go back at once, he stopped, and
hesitated, and debated what to do. And the Nautch people gave him a
drink that was a very powerful spell, insomuch that he soon totally
forgot about his own home, and was married to Moulee, the Nautch girl,
and lived among the Nautch people for many months. At last, one day,
Moulee's mother (the very Nautch woman who had gone with Coplinghee
Ranee and the Sowkar's wife to find Mahadeo) said to Koila, 'Son-in-law,
you are a lazy fellow; you have been here now for a long time, but you
do nothing for your support; it is we who have to pay for your food, we
who have to provide your clothes--go now and fetch us some money, or I
will turn you out of the house and you shall never see your wife Moulee
again. Koila had no money to give his mother-in-law; then, for the first
time, he bethought him of his own country and of Chandra, and he said,
'My first wife, who lives in my own country, has on her feet two bangles
of very great value; let me return home and fetch one of them to sell,
which will more than pay whatever I owe you.' The Nautch people
consented. So Koila returned to his own home, and told Chandra what he
wanted the money for, and asked her to let him have one of her bangles,
but she refused, saying, 'You have been away a long, long time and left
me all alone, and chosen for your second wife one of the Nautch people,
and become one of them, and now you want to take one of my bangles, the
bangles that I had when a little child, that have grown with my growth,
and never been taken off, and to give it to your other wife. This shall
not be; go back if you will to your new friends, but I will not give you
my bangle.'

He answered, 'They gave me an enchanted drink which made me forget you
for a time, but I am weary of them all; let me but go and pay my
mother-in-law the money I owe her for food and clothes, and I will
return and live in my own land, for you are my first wife.'

'Very well,' she said, 'you may take tile bangle and sell it, and give
the money to your second wife's mother, but take me also with you when
you go; do not leave me here all alone again.' Koila agreed, and they
both set off together towards the Madura Tinivelly country.

As they journeyed, Krishnaswami,  <span
id="fr_90"></span>[12](#fn_90.md)who was playing at cards with his three
wives, saw them, and when he saw them he laughed. Then his wives said to
him, 'Why do you laugh? You have not laughed for such a long time, what
amuses you so much now?' He answered, 'I am laughing to see Koila and
his wife Chandra Ranee journeying towards the Madura Tinivelly country.
He is going to sell his wife's bangle, and he will only be killed, and
then she in anger will burn up all the country. O foolish people!' The
goddesses answered, 'This is a very dreadful thing; let us go in
disguise, and warn him not to enter the country.'--' It would be
useless,' said Krishnaswami; 'if you do, he will only laugh at you and
get angry with you.' But the goddesses determined to do their best to
avert the threatened calamity. So they disguised themselves as old
fortune-tellers, and went out with little lamps and their sacred books,
to meet Koila as he came along the road followed by his wife. Then they
said to him, 'Come not into the Madura Tinivelly country, for if you
come you will be killed, and your wife in her fury will burn all the
land with fire.' At first, Koila would not listen to them; then he bade
them go away; and lastly, when they continued warning him, got angry,
and beat them out of his path, saying, 'Do you think I am to be
frightened out of the country by a parcel of old crones like you?'

Then Krishnaswami's three wives returned to him, much enraged at the
treatment they had received, but he only said to them, 'Did not I tell
you not to go, warning you that it would be useless?'

On getting near the Rajah's capital, Koila and Chandra came to the house
of an old milk-seller, who was very kind to them, and gave them food and
shelter for the night. Next morning Koila said to his wife, 'You had
better stay here; this good old woman will take care of you, while I go
into the town to sell your bangle.' Chandra agreed, and remained at the
old woman's house while her husband went into the town. Of course he did
not know that the Rajah and his wife (the Coplinghee Ranee) were
Chandra's father and mother, any more than they, or Chandra herself,
knew it, or than the three Mango children knew the story of their
mothers' journey in search of Mahadeo.

Now a short time before Koila and Chandra reached the Madura Tinivelly
country, Coplinghee Ranee had sent a very handsome pair of bangles to a
Jeweller in the town to be cleaned. It chanced that in a high tree close
to the Jeweller's house two eagles had built their nest, and the young
eagles, who were very noisy birds, used to scream all day long, and
greatly disturb the Jeweller's family. So one day when the old birds
were away, the Jeweller's son climbed the tree, and pulled down the
nest, and put the young eagles to death. When the old birds returned
home and saw what was done, it grieved them very much, and they said,
'These cruel people have killed our children, let us punish them.' And
seeing in the porch one of Coplinghee Ranee's beautiful bangles, which
the Jeweller had just been cleaning, they swooped down and flew away
with it.  <span id="fr_91"></span>[13](#fn_91.md)

The Jeweller did not know what to do; he said to his wife, 'To buy such
a bangle as that would cost more than all our fortune, and to make one
like it would take many, many years; I dare not say I have lost it, or
they would think I had stolen it, and put me to death. The only thing I
can do is to delay returning the other as long as possible, and try
somehow to get one like it.' So next day when the Ranee sent to inquire
if her bangles were ready, he answered, 'They are not ready yet; they
will be ready to-morrow.' And the next day, and the next, he said the
same thing. At last the Ranee's messengers got very angry at the
continued delays; then, seeing he could no longer make excuses, the
Jeweller sent the one bangle by them to the palace, beautifully cleaned,
with a message that the other also would shortly be ready, but all this
time he was hunting for a bangle costly enough to take the Ranee as a
substitute for the one the eagles had carried away. Such a bangle,
however, he could not find.

When Koila reached the town, he spread out a sheet in the corner of a
street near the market-place, and, placing Chandra's bangle upon it, sat
down close by, waiting for customers. Now, he was very, very handsome.
Although dressed so plainly, he looked like a Prince, and the bangle he
had to sell flashed in the morning light like seven suns. Such a
handsome youth, and such a beautiful bangle, the people had never seen
before; and many passers-by, with chattees on their heads, for watching
him let the chattees tumble down and break, they were so much
astonished; and several men and women, who were looking out of the
windows of their houses, leant too far forward, and fell into the
street, so giddy did they become from wonder and amazement!

But no one could be found to buy the bangle, for they all said 'We
cannot afford such jewels; this bangle is fit only for a Ranee to wear.'
At last, when the day had nearly gone, who should come by but the
Jeweller who had been employed to clean Coplinghee Ranee's bangles, and
who was in search of one to replace that which the eagles had stolen. No
sooner did he see the one belonging to Chandra, which Koila was trying
to sell, than he said to himself, 'That is the very thing I want, if I
can only get it.' So he called his wife, and said to her, 'Go to that
bangle-seller and speak kindly to him; say that the day is nearly gone,
and invite him to come and lodge at our house for the night. For if we
can make friends with him and get him to trust us, I shall be able to
take the bangle from him, and say he stole it from me. And as he is a
stranger here, every one will believe my word rather than his. This
bangle is exactly the thing for me to take Coplinghee Ranee, for it is
very like her own, only more beautiful.'

The Jeweller's wife did as she was told, and then the Jeweller himself
went up to Koila and said to him, 'You are a bangle-seller, and I am a
bangle-seller; therefore I look upon you as a brother. Come home, I pray
you, with us, as my wife begs you to do, and we will give you food and
shelter for the night, since you are a stranger in this country.' So
these cunning people coaxed Koila to go home with them to their house,
and pretended to be very kind to him, and gave him supper, and a bed to
rest on for the night; but next morning early the Jeweller raised a hue
and cry, and sent for the police, and bade them take Koila before the
Rajah instantly, since he had stolen and tried to sell one of Coplinghee
Ranee's bangles which he (the Jeweller) had been given to clean. It was
in vain that Koila protested his innocence, and declared that the bangle
he had belonged to his wife; he was a stranger--nobody would believe
him. They dragged him to the palace, and the Jeweller accused him to the
Rajah, saying, This man tried to steal the Ranee's bangle (which I had
been given to clean) and to sell it. If he had done so, you would have
thought I had stolen it, and killed me; I demand, therefore, that he in
punishment shall be put to death.'

Then they sent for the Ranee to show her the bangle, but as soon as she
saw it she recognised it as one of the bangles which had belonged to
Chandra, and burst into tears, crying, 'This is not my bangle. O my
lord, no jeweller on earth made this bangle! See, it is different from
mine; and when any one comes near it, it tinkles, and all the little
bells begin to ring. Have you forgotten it? This was my beauty's bangle!
my diamond's! my little darling's! my lost child's! Where did it come
from? How did it come here? How into this land, and into this town and
bazaar, among these wicked people? For this Jeweller must have kept my
bangle and brought this one in its place. No human goldsmith's hands
made this; for it is none other than Chandra's.' Then she begged the
Rajah to inquire further about it.

But they all thought her mad; and the Jeweller said, 'It is the Ranee's
fancy, for this is the same bangle she gave me to clean.' The other
people also agreed that both the bangles were almost exactly alike, and
must be a pair; and it being certain that Koila had had the bangle when
he was seized by the police, the Rajah ordered him to be instantly
executed. But the Ranee took Chandra's bangle and locked it away in a
strong cupboard, apart from all her other jewels.

Then they took Koila out into the jungle and would have cut off his
head, but he said to his guards, 'If I must die, let me die by my own
hands,' and drawing his sword he fell upon it, and as the sword was very
sharp it cut his body in two--one half fell on one side of the sword,
and the other half on the other side--and they left his body where it
fell.

When news of what had taken place came to the town, many people who had
seen Koila selling his bangle the day before began to murmur, saying,
'There must be some injustice here--the Rajah has been over-hasty. Most
likely the poor man did not steal the bangle. He would not have tried to
sell it openly before us all in the bazaar if it had been stolen
property. How cruel of the Rajab to put such a handsome, gentle,
noble-looking youth to death--and he was a stranger too!' And many wept
at thought of his hard fate. When the Rajah heard of this he was very
angry, and sent and commanded that the matter should be no further
discussed in the town, saying, 'If any one speaks another word of what
has been done, or laments or sheds tears for the dead, he shall be
instantly hanged.' Then the people all felt very frightened, and not a
soul dared to speak of Koila, though every one thought about him much.

Early the very morning that this happened, the old milk-seller (at whose
house, which was a little out of the town, Chandra had been sleeping),
took her guest a bowl full of milk to drink; but no sooner had Chandra
tasted it than she began to cry, saying, 'Good mother, what have you
done? my mouth is full of blood!'--'No, no, my daughter,' answered the
old woman; 'you must have been dreaming some bad dream. See, this is
pure, fresh, warm milk I have brought you; drink again.' But when
Chandra tasted it for the second time, she answered, 'Oh no! Oh no! it
is not milk that I taste, but blood. All last night I had a dreadful
dream, and this morning when I woke I found that my marriage necklace
had snapped in two; and now this milk tastes to me as blood. Let me go!
let me go! for I know my husband is dead.'

The good old woman tried to comfort her, saying, 'Why should you fancy
he is dead? He was quite well yesterday, when he went to sell your
bangle; and he said he would come back to you soon; in a little while,
very likely, he will be here.' But she answered, 'No, no; I feel sure
that he is dead! Oh, let me go! for I must find him before I die.' Then
the old woman said, 'You must not go; you are too beautiful to run about
through the streets of this strange town alone; and your husband would
be very angry if he saw you doing so, and who knows but that you might
lose your way, and get carried off as a slave? remember, he told you to
stay here till he returned. Be patient; remain where you are, and I will
go quickly into the town and seek your husband. If he is alive I will
bring him back to you, and if he is dead I will bring you word.' So,
taking a chattee full of milk on her head, as if to sell, she went to
the town to find Koila, while every minute seemed an hour to Chandra,
until her return.

When the old milk-seller reached the town, she went up and down all the
streets, looking for Koila, or expecting to hear some one mention the
handsome stranger who had gone to sell such a wonderful bangle the day
before. But she could not find him, nor did she hear him spoken of; for
all were afraid to say a word about him, on account of the Rajah's
decree. Being unable to trace him, the old woman got suspicious, and
began to search more carefully than before, down all the streets near
the marketplace, where she thought he was most likely to have gone; but,
lest people should wonder at her errand, she called out each time as if
she had some different thing to sell. First, 'Buy some milk--who 'll buy
milk--who 'll buy?' Then, on going for a second time down the same
street, 'Buy butter--butter! very fine butter!' and so on. At last one
woman, who had been watching her with some curiosity, said, 'Old woman,
what nonsense you talk! you have been half a dozen times up and down
this same street, as if you had half a dozen different things to sell in
that one chattee. Any one would think you had as little sense as that
pretty young bangle-seller yesterday, who spent all the day trying to
sell it, and got put to death for his pains.'

'Of whom do you speak?' asked the old woman. 'Oh!' said the other, 'I
suppose as you're a milk-seller from the country you know nothing about
it. But that's not to be talked about, for the Rajah has said that
whoever speaks of him, or mourns him, shall be instantly hanged. Ah! he
was very handsome.'

'Where is he now?' whispered the old woman. 'There, answered the other;
'you can see the place where that crowd of people has collected. The
Rajab's Jeweller accused him of having stolen the bangle; so he was
executed; many thought unjustly, but do not say I said it.' And so
saying, she pointed towards the jungle some way off. The old woman ran
to the place; but when she there saw the two halves of Koila's body
lying side by side, stiff and cold, she threw her earthen chattee down
on the ground, and fell on her knees, crying bitterly. The noise
attracted the attention of the Rajab's guards, some of whom immediately
seized her, saying, 'Old woman, it is against the law to lament that
dead man, or murmur at the Rajah's decree; you deserve to be put to
death.' But she answered quickly, 'The dead man! I do not cry for the
dead man; can you not see that my chattee is broken, and all the milk
spilt? Is it not enough to make one weep?' And she began to cry again.
'Hush! hush!' they answered; 'don't cry; come, the chattee wasn't worth
much; it was only an earthen thing. Stop your tears, and may be we'll
give you a chattee of gold.'

'I neither care for your golden chattees, nor for silver,' she said
angrily. 'Go away; go away! my earthen chattee was worth them all. My
grandfather's grandfather and my grandmother's grandmother used this
chattee; and to think that it should now be broken and all the milk
spilt.' And picking up the broken pieces, she went home sobbing, as if
the loss of her chattee was all her grief. But when she got to her own
house, she ran in to where Chandra was, crying, 'Alas, my pretty child!
alas, my daughter! your fears are true!' and as gently as she could she
told her what had happened.

No sooner did Chandra hear it than she ran away straight to the Rajah's
Palace in the midst of the town, and rushing into the room where he was,
said, 'How did you dare to kill my husband?'

Now, at the sound of her voice, her bangle, which the Ranee had locked
up in the cupboard, broke through all the intervening doors, and rolled
to Chandra's feet.

The Rajah was unable to answer her a word. Then she fell on her knees,
and rent her clothes, and tore her hair; and when she tore it all the
land began to burn, and all her hair burned too.

Then the old milk-seller, who bad followed her, ran and put a lump of
butter on her head, thinking to cool it; and two other women who were by
fetched water to pour upon her hair, but by this time nineteen lines of
houses were in flames. Then the old woman cried, 'Oh! spare the Purwari
 <span id="fr_92"></span>[14](#fn_92.md) lines; don't burn them down, for I
did all I could for you.' So Chandra did not burn that part of the town
near which the old woman and her friends lived. But the fire burnt on
and on in the other direction; and it killed the Rajah and the Ranee,
and all the people in the palace; and the wicked Jeweller and his
wife--and, as he was dying, Chandra tore out his heart and gave it to
the eagles who hovered overhead, saying, 'Here is vengeance for the
death of your little ones.' And the Nautch girl, Moulee, and her mother,
who were watching the fire from far off, were smothered in the flames.

Then Chandra went to where Koila's dead body lay, and wept over it
bitterly; and as she was weeping, there fell down to her from heaven a
needle and thread; and she took them, saying, 'Oh that I could by any
means restore you!' and, placing the two halves of his body side by
side, she sewed them together.

And when she had done this, she cried to Mahadeo, saying, 'Sire, I have
done the best I can; I have joined the body; give it life.' And as she
said these words Mahadeo had pity on her, and he sent Koila's spirit
back, and it returned to his body again. Then Chandra was glad, and they
returned and lived in their own land.

But to this day in the Madura Tinivelly country you can trace where all
the land was burnt
