# A FUNNY STORY.

<span id="img_08"></span> ![](img/08.jpg)

ONCE upon a time there were a Rajah and Ranee who were much grieved
because they bad no children, and the little dog in the palace had also
no little puppies. At last the Rajah and Ranee bad some children, and it
also happened that the pet dog in the palace had some little puppies;
but unfortunately, the Ranee's two children were two little puppies! and
the dog's two little puppies were two pretty little girls! This vexed
her majesty very much; and sometimes when the dog had gone away to its
dinner, the Ranee used to put the two little puppies (her children) into
the kennel, and carry away the dog's two little girls to the palace.
Then the poor dog grew very unhappy, and said, 'They never will leave my
two little children alone. I must take them away into the jungle, or
their lives will be worried out' So one night she took the little girls
in her mouth and ran with them to the jungle, and there made them a home
in a pretty cave in the rock, beside a clear stream; and every day she
would go into the towns and carry away some nice currie and rice to give
her little daughters; and if she found any pretty clothes or jewels,
that she could bring away in her mouth, she used to take them also for
the children.

Now it happened some time after this, one day, when the dog had gone to
fetch her daughters' dinner, two young Princes (a Rajah and his brother)
came to hunt in the jungle, and they hunted all day and found nothing,
it had been very hot, and they were thirsty; so they went to a tree
which grew on a little piece of high ground, and sent their attendants
to search all round for water; but no one could find any. At last one of
the hunting dogs came to the foot of the tree quite muddy, and the Rajah
said, 'Look, the dog is muddy; he must have found water; follow him, and
see where he goes.' The attendants followed the dog, and saw him go to
the stream at the mouth of the cave where the two children were; and the
children also saw them, and were very much frightened, and ran inside
the cave. Then the attendants returned to the two Princes, and said, 'We
have found clear, sparkling water flowing past a cave, and, what is
more, within the cave are two of the most lovely young ladies that eye
ever beheld, clothed in fine dresses and covered with jewels; but when
they saw us, they were frightened and ran away.' On hearing this the
Princes bade their servants lead them to the place; and when they saw
the two young girls, they were quite charmed with them, and asked them
to go to their kingdom, and become their wives. The maidens were
frightened; but at last the Rajah and his brother persuaded them, and
they went, and the Rajah married the eldest sister, and his brother
married the youngest.

When the dog returned, she was grieved to find her children gone, and
for twelve long years the poor thing ran many, many miles to find them,
but in vain. At last one day she came to the place where the two
Princesses lived. Now it chanced that the eldest, the wife of the Rajah,
was looking out of the window, and seeing the dog run down the street,
she said, 'That must be my dear long-lost mother.' So she ran into the
street as fast as possible, and took the tired dog in her arms, and
brought her into her own room, and made her a nice comfortable bed on
the floor, and bathed her feet, and was very kind to her. Then the dog
said to her, 'My daughter, you are good and kind, and it is a great joy
to me to see you again; but I must not stay, I will first go and see
your younger sister, and then return.' The Ranee answered, 'Do not do
so, dear mother; rest here to-day, tomorrow I will send and let my
sister know, and she too will come and see you.' But the poor, silly dog
would not stay, but ran to the house of her second daughter. Now the
second daughter was looking out of the window when the dog came to the
door, and seeing it, she said to herself, 'That must be my mother. What
will my husband think if he learns that this wretched, ugly,
miserable-looking dog is my mother?' So she ordered her servants to go
and throw stones at it, and drive it away, and they did so; and one
large stone hit the dog's head, and she ran back, very much hurt, to her
eldest daughter's house. The Ranee saw her coming, and ran out into the
Street and brought her in in her arms, and did all she could to make her
well, saying, 'Ah, mother, mother! why did you ever leave my house?' But
all her care was in vain; the poor dog died. Then the Ranee thought her
husband might be vexed if he found a dead dog (an unclean animal) in the
palace; so she put the body in a small room into which the Rajah hardly
ever went, intending to have it reverently buried; and over it she
placed a basket turned topsy-turvy.

It so happened, however, that when the Rajah came to visit his wife, as
chance would have it, he went through this very room, and tripping over
the upturned basket, called for a light to see what it was. Then, lo and
behold! there lay the statue of a dog, life-size, composed entirely of
diamonds, emeralds, and other precious stones, set in gold! So he called
out to his wife, and said, 'Where did you get this beautiful dog?' And
when the Ranee saw the golden dog, she was very much frightened, and,
I'm sorry to say, instead of telling her husband the truth, she told a
story, and said, 'Oh, it is only a present my parents sent me.'

Now see what trouble she got into for not telling the truth.

'Only,' said the Rajah; 'why, this is valuable enough to buy the whole
of my kingdom. Your parents must be very rich people to be able to send
you such presents as this. How is it you never told me of them? Where do
they live?' (Now she had to tell another story to cover the first.\] She
said, 'In the jungle.' He replied, 'I will go and see them; you must
take me and show me where they live.' Then the Ranee thought, 'What will
the Rajah say when he finds I have been telling him such stories? He
will order my head to be cut off.' So she said, 'You must first give me
a palanquin, and I will go into the jungle and tell them you are
coming;' and said she would be back in a while, and got out, and ran to
the ants' nest, and put her finger in the cobra's mouth. Now a large
thorn had run, a short time before, into the cobra's throat, and hurt
him very much; and the Ranee, by putting her finger into his mouth,
pushed out this thorn; then the cobra, feeling much better, turned to
her, and said, 'My dear daughter, you have done me a great kindness,
what return can I make you?' The Ranee told him all her story, and
begged him to bite her that she might die. But the cobra said, 'You did
certainly very wrong to tell the Rajah that story; nevertheless, you
have been very kind to me. I will help you in your difficulty. Send your
husband here. I will provide you with a father and mother of whom you
need not be ashamed.' So the Ranee returned joyfully to the palace, and
invited her husband to come and see her parents.

When they reached the spot near where the cobra was, what a wonderful
sight awaited them! There, in the place which had before been thick
jungle, stood a splendid palace, twenty-four miles long, and twenty-four
miles broad, with gardens and trees and fountains all round; and the
light shining from it was to be seen a hundred miles off. The walls were
made of gold and precious stones, and the carpets of cloth of gold.
Hundreds of servants, in rich dresses, stood waiting in the long, lofty
rooms; and in the last room of all, upon golden thrones, sat a
magnificent old Rajah and Ranee, who introduced themselves to the young
Rajah as his father- and mother-in-law. The Rajah and Ranee stayed at
the palace six months, and were entertained the whole of that time with
feasting and music; and they left for their own home loaded with
presents. Before they started, however, the Ranee went to her friend the
cobra, and said, 'You have conjured up all these beautiful things to get
me out of my difficulties, but my husband, the Rajah, has enjoyed his
visit so much that he will certainly want to come here again. Then, if
he returns and finds nothing at all, he will be very angry with me.' The
friendly cobra answered, 'Do not fear. When you have gone twenty-four
miles on your journey, look back, and see what you will see.' So they
started; and on looking back at the end of twenty-four miles, saw the
whole of the splendid palace in flames, the fire reaching up to heaven.
The Rajah returned to see if he could help anybody to escape, or invite
them in their distress to his court; but he found that all was burnt
down--not a stone nor a living creature remained.

Then he grieved much over the sad fate of his parents-in-law.

When the party returned home, the Rajah's brother said to him, 'Where
did you get these magnificent presents?' He replied, 'They are gifts
from my father- and mother-in-law.' At this news the Rajab's brother
went home to his wife very discontented, and asked her why she had never
told him of her parents, and taken him to see them, whereby he might
have received rich gifts as well as his brother. His wife then went to
her sister, and inquired how she had managed to get all her beautiful
new things. But the Ranee said, 'Go away, you wicked woman! I will not
speak to you. You killed the poor dog, our mother.'

But afterwards she told her all about it.

The sister then said, 'I shall go and see the cobra, and get presents
too.' The Ranee answered, 'You can go if you like.'

So the sister ordered her palanquin, and told her husband she was going
to see her parents, and prepare them for a visit from him. When she
reached the ants' nest, she saw the cobra there, and she went and put
her finger in his mouth, and the cobra bit her, and she died.
