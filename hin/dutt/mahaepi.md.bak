# MAHABHARATA - TRANSLATOR'S EPILOGUE

ANCIENT India, like ancient Greece, boasts of two great Epics. One of
them, the *Maha-bharata*, relates to a great war in which all the
warlike races of Northern India took a share, and may therefore be
compared to the Iliad. The other, the *Ramayana*, relates mainly to the
adventures of its hero, banished from his country and wandering for long
years in the wildernesses of Southern India, and may therefore be
compared to the Odyssey. It is the first of these two Epics, the Iliad
of Ancient India, which is the subject of the foregoing pages.

The great war which is the subject of this Epic is believed to have been
fought in the thirteenth or fourteenth century before Christ. For
generations and centuries after the war its main incidents must have
been sung by bards and minstrels in the courts of Northern India. The
war thus became the centre of a cycle of legends, songs, and poems in
ancient India, even as Charlemagne and Arthur became the centres of
legends in mediæval Europe. And then, probably under the direction of
some enlightened king, the vast mass of legends and poetry, accumulated
during centuries, was cast in a narrative form and formed the Epic of
the Great Bharata nation, and therefore called the *Maha-bharata*. The
real facts of the war had been obliterated by age, legendary heroes had
become the principal actors, and, as is invariably the case in India,
the thread of a high moral purpose, of the triumph of virtue and the
subjugation of vice, was woven into the fabric of the great Epic.

We should have been thankful if this Epic, as it was thus originally put
together some centuries before the Christian era, had been preserved to
us. But this was not to be. The Epic became so popular that it went on
growing with the growth of centuries. Every generation of poets had
something to add; every distant nation in Northern India was anxious to
interpolate some account of its deeds in the old record of the
international war; every preacher of a new creed desired to have in the
old Epic some sanction for the new truths he inculcated. Passages from
legal and moral codes were incorporated in the work which appealed to
the nation much more effectively than dry codes; and rules about the
different castes and about the different stages of the human life were
included for the same purpose. All the floating mass of tales,
traditions, legends, and myths, for which ancient India was famous,
found a shelter under the expanding wings of this wonderful Epic; and as
Krishna-worship became the prevailing religion of India after the decay
of Buddhism, the old Epic caught the complexion of the times, and
Krishna-cult is its dominating religious idea in its present shape. It
is thus that the work went on growing for a thousand years after it was
first compiled and put together in the form of an Epic; until the
crystal rill of the Epic itself was all but lost in an unending morass
of religious and didactic episodes, legends, tales, and traditions.

When the mischief had been done, and the Epic had nearly assumed its
present proportions, a few centuries after Christ according to the late
Dr. Bühler, an attempt was made to prevent the further expansion of the
work. The contents of the Epic were described in some prefatory verses,
and the number of couplets in each Book was stated. The total number of
couplets, according to this metrical preface, is about eighty-five
thousand. But the limit so fixed has been exceeded in still later
centuries; further additions and interpolations have been made; and the
Epic as printed and published in Calcutta in this century contains over
ninety thousand couplets, excluding the Supplement about the Race of
Hari.

The modern reader will now understand the reason why this great Epic-the
greatest work of imagination that Asia has produced-has never yet been
put before the European reader in a readable form. A poem of ninety
thousand couplets, about seven times the size of the Iliad and the
Odyssey put together, is more than what the average reader can stand;
and the heterogeneous nature of its contents does not add to the
interest of the work. If the religious works of Hooker and Jeremy
Taylor, the philosophy of Hobbes and Locke, the commentaries of
Blackstone and the ballads of Percy, together with the tractarian
writings of Newman, Keble, and Pusey, were all thrown into blank verse
and incorporated with the Paradise Lost, the reader would scarcely be
much to blame if he failed to appreciate that delectable compound. A
complete translation of the *Maha-bharata* therefore into English verse
is neither possible nor desirable, but portions of it have now and then
been placed before English readers by distinguished writers. Dean
Milman's graceful rendering of the story of Nala and Damayanti is still
read and appreciated by a select circle of readers; and Sir Edwin
Arnold's beautiful translation of the concluding books of the Epic is
familiar to a larger circle of Englishmen. A complete translation of the
Epic into English prose has also been published in India, and is useful
to Sanscrit scholars for the purpose of reference.

But although the old Epic had thus been spoilt by unlimited expansion,
yet nevertheless the leading incidents and characters of the real Epic
are still discernible, uninjured by the mass of foreign substance in
which they are embedded--even like those immortal marble figures which
have been recovered from the ruins of an ancient world, and now beautify
the museums of modern Europe. For years past I have thought that it was
perhaps not impossible to exhume this buried Epic from the
superincumbent mass of episodical matter, and to restore it to the
modern world. For years past I have felt a longing to undertake this
work, but the task was by no means an easy one. Leaving out all
episodical matter, the leading narrative of the Epic forms about
one-fourth of the work; and a complete translation even of this leading
story would be unreadable, both from its length and its prolixness. On
the other hand, to condense the story into shorter limits would be, not
to make a translation, but virtually to write a new poem; and that was
not what I desired to undertake, nor what I was competent to perform.

There seemed to me only one way out of this difficulty. The main
incidents of the Epic are narrated in the original work in passages
which are neither diffuse nor unduly prolix, and which are interspersed
in the leading narrative of the Epic, at that narrative itself is
interspersed in the midst of more lengthy episodes. The more carefully I
examined the arrangement, the more clearly it appeared to me that these
main incidents of the Epic would bear a full and unabridged translation
into English verse; and that these translations, linked together by
short connecting notes, would virtually present the entire story of the
Epic to the modern reader in a form and within limits which might be
acceptable. It would be, no doubt, a condensed version of the original
Epic, but the condensation would be effected, not by the translator
telling a short story in his own language, but by linking together those
passages of the original which describe the main and striking incidents,
and thus telling the main story as told in the original work. The
advantage of this arrangement is that, in the passages presented to the
reader, it is the poet who speaks to him, not the translator. Though
vast portions of the original are skipped over, those which are
presented are the portions which narrate the main incidents of the Epic,
and they describe those incidents as told by the poet himself.

This is the plan I have generally adopted in the present work. Except in
the three books which describe the actual war (Books viii., ix., and
x.), the other nine books of this translation are complete translations
of selected passages of the original work. I have not attempted to
condense these passages nor to expand them; I have endeavoured to put
them before the English reader as they have been told by the poet in
Sanscrit. Occasionally, but rarely, a few redundant couplets have been
left out, or a long list of proper names or obscure allusions has been
shortened; and in one place only, at the beginning of the Fifth Book, I
have added twelve couplets of my own to explain the circumstances under
which the story of Savitri is told. Generally, therefore, the
translation may be accepted as an unabridged, though necessarily a free
translation of the passages describing the main incidents of the Epic.

From this method I have been compelled to depart, much against my wish,
in the three books describing the actual war. No translation of an Epic
relating to a great war can be acceptable which does not narrate the
main events of the war. The war of the, *Maha-bharata* was a series of
eighteen battles, fought on eighteen consecutive days, and I felt it
necessary to present the reader with an account of each day's work. In
order to do so, I have been compelled to condense, and not merely to
translate selected passages. For the transactions of the war, unlike the
other incidents of the Epic, have been narrated in the original with
almost inconceivable prolixity and endless repetition; and the process
of condensation in these three books has therefore been severe and
thorough. But, nevertheless, even in these books I have endeavoured to
preserve the character and the spirit of the original. Not only are the
incidents narrated in the same order as in the original, but they are
told in the style of the poet as far as possible. Even the similes and
metaphors and figures of speech are all or mostly adopted from the
original; the translator has not ventured either to adopt his own
distinct style of narration, or to improve on the style of the original
with his own decorations.

Such is the scheme I have adopted in presenting an Epic of ninety  
thousand Sanscrit couplets in about two thousand English couplets.

The excellent and deservedly popular prose translation of the Odyssey of
Homer by Messrs. Butcher and Lang often led me to think that perhaps a
prose translation of these selected passages from the *Maha-bharata*
might be more acceptable to the modern reader. But a more serious
consideration of the question dispelled that idea. Homer has an interest
for the European reader which the *Maha-bharata* cannot lay claim to; as
the father of European poetry he has a claim on the veneration of modern
Europe which an Indian poet can never pretend to. To thousands of
European readers Homer is familiar in the original, to hundreds of
thousands he is known in various translations in various modern
languages. What Homer actually wrote, a numerous class of students in
Europe wish to know; and a literal prose translation therefore is
welcome, after the great Epic has been so often translated in verse. The
case is very different with the *Maha-bharata*, practically unknown to
European readers. And the translators of Homer themselves gracefully
acknowledge, "We have tried to transfer, not all the truth about the
poem, but the historical truth into English. In this process Homer must
lose at least half his charm, his bright and equable speed, the musical
current of that narrative, which, like the river of Egypt, flows from an
undiscoverable source, and mirrors the temples and the palaces of
unforgotten gods and kings. Without the music of verse, only a half
truth about Homer can be told."

Another earnest worker of the present day, who is endeavouring to
interpret to modern Englishmen the thoughts and sentiments and poetry of
their Anglo-Saxon ancestors, has emphatically declared that "of all
possible translations of poetry, a merely prose translation is the most
inaccurate." "Prose," says Mr. Stopford Brooke, further on, "no more
represents poetry than architecture does music. Translations of poetry
are never much good, but at least they should always endeavour to have
the musical movement of poetry, and to obey the laws of the verse they
translate."

This appears to me to be a very sound maxim. And one of my greatest
difficulties in the task I have undertaken has been to try and preserve
something of the "musical movement" of the sonorous Sanscrit poetry in
the English translation. Much of the Sanscrit Epic is written in the
well-known *Sloka* metre of sixteen syllables in each line, and I
endeavoured to choose some English metre which is familiar to the
English ear, and which would reproduce to some extent the rhythm, the
majesty, and the long and measured sweep of the Sanscrit verse. It was
necessary to adopt such a metre in order to transfer something of the
truth about the *Maha-bharata*. into English, for without such
reproduction or imitation of the musical movement of the original very
much less than a half truth is told. My kind friend Mr. Edmund Russell,
impelled by that enthusiasm for Indian poetry and Indian art which is a
part of him, rendered me valuable help and assistance in this matter,
and I gratefully acknowledge, the benefit I have derived from his advice
and suggestions. After considerable trouble and anxiety, and after
rendering several books in different English metres, I felt convinced
that the one finally adopted was a nearer approach to the Sanscrit Sloka
than any other familiar English metre known to me.

I have recited a verse in this English metre and a *Sloka* in presence
of listeners who have a better ear for music than myself, and they have
marked the close resemblance. I quote a few lines from the Sanscrit
showing varieties of the *Sloka* metre, and comparing them with the
scheme of the English metre selected.

<span id="img_dutt01"></span> ![](img/dutt01.jpg)

It would be too much to assume that even with the help of this
similarity in metres, I have been able to transfer into my English that
sweep and majesty of verse which is the charm of Sanscrit, and which
often sustains and elevates the simplest narration and the plainest
ideas. Without the support of those sustaining wings, my poor narration
must often plod through the dust; and I can only ask for the indulgence
of the reader, which every translator of poetry from a foreign language
can with reason ask, if the story as told in the translation is
sometimes but a plain, simple, and homely narrative. For any artistic
decoration I have neither the inclination nor the necessary
qualification. The crisp and ornate style, the quaint expression, the
chiselled word, the new-coined phrase, in which modern English poetry is
rich, would scarcely suit the translation of an old Epic whose
predominating characteristic is its simple and easy flow of narrative.
Indeed, the *Maha-bharata* would lose that unadorned simplicity which is
its first and foremost feature if the translator ventured to decorate it
with the art of the modern day, even if he had been qualified to do so.

For if there is one characteristic feature which distinguishes the
*Maha-bharata* (as well as the other Indian Epic, the *Ramayana*) from
all later Sanscrit literature, it is the grand simplicity of its
narrative, which contrasts with the artificial graces of later Sanscrit
poptry. The poetry of Kalidisa for instance, is ornate. and beautiful,
and almost scintillates with similes in every verse; the poetry of the
*Maha-bharara* is plain and unpolished, and scarcely stoops to a simile
or a figure of speech unless the simile comes naturally to the poet. The
great deeds of godlike kings sometimes suggest to the poet the mighty
deeds of gods; the rushing of warriors suggests the rushing of angry
elephants in the echoing jungle; the flight of whistling arrows suggests
the flight of sea-birds; the sound and movement of surging crowds
suggest the heaving of billows; the erect attitude of a warrior suggests
a tall cliff; the beauty of a maiden suggests the soft beauty of the
blue lotus. When such comparisons come naturally to the poet, he accepts
them and notes them down, but he never seems to go in quest of them, he
is never anxious to beautify and decorate. He seems to trust entirely to
his grand narrative, to his heroic characters, to his stirring
incidents, to hold millions of listeners in perpetual thrall. The
majestic and sonorous Sanscrit metre is at his command, and even this he
uses, carelessly, and with frequent slips, known as *arsha* to later
grammarians. The poet certainly seeks for no art to decorate his tale,
he trusts to the lofty chronicle of bygone heroes to enchain the
listening mankind.

And what heroes! In the delineation of character the *Maha-bharata* is
far above anything which we find in later Sanscrit poetry. Indeed, with
much that is fresh and sweet and lovely in later Sanscrit poetry, there
is little or no portraiture of character. All heroes are cast much in
the same heroic mould; all love-sick heroines suffer in silence and burn
with fever, all fools are shrewd and impudent by turns, all knaves are
heartless and cruel and suffer in the end. There is not much to
distinguish between one warrior and another, between one tender woman
and her sister. In the *Maha-bharata* we find just the reverse; each
hero has a distinct individuality, a character of his own, clearly
discernible from that of other heroes. No work of the imagination that
could be named, always excepting the Iliad, is so rich and so true as
the *Maha-bharata* in the portraiture of the human character,-not in
torment and suffering as in Dante, not under overwhelming passions as in
Shakespeare,--but human character in its calm dignity of strength and
repose, like those immortal figures in marble which the ancients turned
out, and which modern sculptors have vainly sought to reproduce. The old
Kuru monarch Dhrita-rashtra, sightless and feeble, but majestic in his
ancient grandeur; the noble grandsire Bhishma, "death's subduer" and
unconquerable in war; the doughty Drona, venerable priest and vengeful
warrior; and the proud and peerless archer Karna-have each a distinct
character of his own which can not be mistaken for a moment. The good
and royal Yudhishthir, (I omit the final a in some long names which
occur frequently), the "tiger-waisted" Bhima, and the "helmet-wearing"
Arjun are the Agamemnon, the Ajax, and the Achilles of the Indian Epic.
The proud and unyielding Duryodhan, and the fierce and fiery Duhsasan
stand out foremost among the wrathful sons of the feeble old Kuru
monarch. And Krishna possesses a character higher than that of Ulysses;
unmatched in human wisdom, ever striving for righteousness and peace, he
is thorough and unrelenting in war when war has begun. And the women of
the Indian Epic possess characters as marked as those of the men. The
stately and majestic queen Gandhari, the loving and doting mother
Pritha, the proud and scornful Draupadi nursing her wrath till her
wrongs are fearfully revenged, and the bright and brilliant and sunny
Subhadra,--these are distinct images pencilled by the hand of a true
master in the realm of creative imagination.

And if the characters of the *Maha-bharata* impress themselves on the
reader, the incidents of the Epic are no less striking. Every scene on
the shifting stage is a perfect and impressive picture. The tournament
of the princes in which Arjun and Karna-the Achilles and Hector of the
Indian Epic-first met and each marked the other for his foe; the
gorgeous bridal of Draupadi; the equally gorgeous coronation of
Yudhishthir and the death of the proud and boisterous Sisupala; the
fatal game of dice and the scornful wrath of Draupadi against her
insulters; the calm beauty of the forest life of the Pandavs; the
cattle-lifting in Matsyaland in which the gallant Arjun threw off his
disguise and stood forth as warrior and conqueror; and the Homeric
speeches of the warriors in the council of war on the eve of the great
contest,--each scene of this venerable old Epic impresses itself on the
mind of the hushed and astonished reader. Then follows the war of
eighteen days. The first few days are more or less uneventful, and have
been condensed in this translation often into a few couplets; but the
interest of the reader increases as he approaches the final battle and
fall of the grand old fighter Bhishma. Then follows the stirring story
of the death of Arjun's gallant boy, and Arjun's fierce revenge, and the
death of the priest and warrior, doughty Drona. Last comes the crowning
event of the Epic, the final contest between Arjun and Karna, the heroes
of the Epic, and the war ends in a midnight slaughter and the death of
Duryodhan. The rest of the story is told in this translation in two
books describing the funerals of the deceased warriors, and
Yudhishthir's horse-sacrifice.

"The poems of Homer," says Mr. Gladstone, "differ from all other known
poetry in this, that they constitute in themselves an encyclopædia of
life and knowledge; at a time when knowledge, indeed, such as lies
beyond the bounds of actual experience, was extremely limited, and when
life was singularly fresh, vivid, and expansive." This remark applies
with even greater force to the *Maha-bharata*; it is an encyclopædia of
the life and knowledge of Ancient India. And it discloses to us an
ancient and forgotten world, a proud and noble civilisation which has
passed away. Northern India was then parcelled among warlike races
living side by side under their warlike kings, speaking the same
language, performing the same religious rites and ceremonies, rejoicing
in a common literature, rivalling each other in their schools of
philosophy and learning as in the arts of peace and civilisation, and
forming a confederation of Hindu nations unknown to and unknowing the
outside world. What this confederation of nations has done for the cause
of human knowledge and human civilisation is a matter of history. Their
inquiries into the hidden truths of religion, embalmed in the ancient
*Upanishads*, have never been excelled within the last three thousand
years. Their inquiries into philosophy, preserved in the *Sankhya* and
the *Vedanta* systems, were the first systems of true philosophy which
the world produced. And their great works of imagination, the
*Maha-bharata* and the *Ramayana*, will be placed without hesitation by
the side of Homer by critics who survey the world's literatures from a
lofty standpoint, and judge impartially of the wares turned out by the
hand of man in all parts of the globe. It is scarcely necessary to add
that the discoveries of the ancient Hindus in science, and specially in
mathematics, are the heritage of the modern world; and that the lofty
religion of Buddha, proclaimed in India five centuries before Christ, is
now the religion of a third of the human race. For the rest, the people
of modern India know how to appreciate their ancient heritage. It is not
an exaggeration to state that the two hundred millions of Hindus of the
present day cherish in their hearts the story of their ancient Epics.
The Hindu scarcely lives, man or woman, high or low, educated or
ignorant, whose earliest recollections do not cling round the story and
the characters of the great Epics. The almost illiterate
oil-manufacturer or confectioner of Bengal spells out some modern
translation of the Maha-bharata to while away his leisure hour. The tall
and stalwart peasantry of the North-West know of the five Pandav
brothers, and of their friend the righteous Krishna. The people of
Bombay and Madras cherish with equal ardour the story of the righteous
war. And even the traditions and tales interspersed in the Epic, and
which spoil the work as an Epic, have themselves a charm and an
attraction; and the morals inculcated in these tales sink into the
hearts of a naturally religious people, and form the basis of their
moral education. Mothers in India know no better theme for imparting
wisdom and instruction to their daughters, and elderly men know no
richer storehouse for narrating tales to children, than these stories
preserved in the Epics. No work in Europe, not Homer in Greece or Virgil
in Italy, not Shakespeare or Milton in English-speaking lands, is the
national property of the nations to the same extent as the Epics of
India are of the Hindus. No single work except the Bible has such
influence in affording moral instruction in Christian lands as the
*Maha-bharata* and the *Ramayana* in India. They have been the cherished
heritage of the Hindus for three thousand years; they are to the present
day interwoven with the thoughts and beliefs and moral ideas of a nation
numbering two hundred millions.
