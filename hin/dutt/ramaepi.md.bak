# RAMAYANA - EPILOGUE BY THE TRANSLATOR

Ancient India, like ancient Greece, boasts of two great Epics. The
*Maha-bharata*, based on the legends and traditions of a great
historical war, is the Iliad of India. The *Ramayana*, describing the
wanderings and adventures of a prince banished from his country, has so
far something in common with the Odyssey. Having placed before English
readers a condensed translation of the Indian Iliad, I have thought it
necessary to prepare the present condensed translation of the Indian
Odyssey to complete the work. The two together comprise the whole of the
Epic literature of the ancient Hindus; and the two together present us
with the most graphic and lifelike picture that exists of the
civilisation and culture, the political and social life, the religion
and thought of ancient India.

The *Ramayana*, like the *Maha-bharata*, is a growth of centuries, but
the main story is more distinctly the creation of one mind. Among the
many cultured races that flourished in Northern India about a thousand
years before Christ, the Kosalas of Oudh and the Videhas of North Behar
were perhaps the most cultured. Their Monarchs were famed for their
learning as well as for their prowess, Their priests distinguished
themselves by founding schools of learning which were known all over
India. Their sacrifices and gifts to the learned drew together the most
renowned men of the age from distant regions. Their celebrated
Universities (Parishads) were frequented by students from surrounding
countries. Their compilations of the old Vedic Hymns were used in
various parts of India. Their elaborate Brahmanas or Commentaries on the
Vedas were handed down from generation to generation by priestly
families. Their researches into the mysteries of the Soul. and into the
nature of the One Universal Soul which pervades the creation, are still
preserved in the ancient Upanishads, and are among the most valuable
heritages which have been left to us by the ancients. And their
researches and discoveries in science and philosophy gave them the
foremost place among the gifted races of ancient India.

It would appear that the flourishing period of the Kosalas and the
Videhas had already passed away, and the traditions of their prowess and
learning had become a revered memory in India, when the poet composed
the great Epic which perpetuates their fame. Distance of time lent a
higher lustre to the achievements of these gifted races, and the age in
which they flourished appeared to their descendants as the Golden Age of
India. To the imagination of the poet, the age of the Kosalas and
Videhas was associated with all that is great and glorious, all that is
righteous and true. His description of Ayodhya, the capital town of the
Kossalas, is a description of an ideal seat of righteousness. Dasa-ratha
the king of the Kosalas is an ideal king, labouring for the good of a
loyal people. Rama, the eldest son of Dasa-ratha and the hero of the
Epic, is an ideal prince, brave and accomplished, devoted to his duty,
unfaltering in his truth. The king of the Videhas, Janak (or rather
Janaka, but I have omitted the final a of some names in this
translation), is a monarch and a saint. Sita, the daughter of Janak and
the heroine of the Epic, is the ideal of a faithful woman and a devoted
wife. A pious reverence for the past pervades the great Epic; a lofty
admiration of what is true and ennobling in the human character
sanctifies the work; and delineations of the domestic life and the
domestic virtues of the ancient Hindus, rich in tenderness and pathos,
endear the picture to the hearts of the people of India to the present
day.

It is probable that the first connected narrative of this Epic was
composed within a few centuries after the glorious age of the Kosalas
and the Videhas. But the work became so popular that it grew with age.
It grew,--not like the *Maha-Bharata* by the incorporation of new
episodes, tales, and traditions,--but by fresh descriptions of the same
scenes and incidents. Generations of poets were never tired of adding to
the description of scenes which were dear to the Hindu, and patient
Hindu listeners were never tired of listening to such repetitions. The
virtues of Rama and the faithfulness of Sita were described again and
again in added lines and cantos. The grief of the old monarch at the
banishment of the prince, and the sorrows of the mother at parting from
her son, were depicted by succeeding versifiers in fresh verses. The
loving devotion of Rama's brothers, the sanctity of saints, and the
peace fulness of the hermitages visited by Rama, were described with
endless reiteration. The long account of the grief of Rama at the loss
of his wife, and stories of unending battles waged for her recovery,
occupied generations of busy interpolators.

The Sloka verse in which much of the Ramayana is composed is the easiest
of Sanscrit, metres, and afforded a fatal facility to poets and often we
have the same scene, fully and amply described in one canto, repeated
again in the two or three succeeding cantos. The unity of the
composition is lost by these additions, and the effect of the narrative
is considerably weakened by such endless repetition. It would appear
that the original work ended with the sixth Book, which describes the
return of the hero to his country and to his loving subjects. The
seventh Book is called Uttara or Supplemental, and in it we are told
something of the dimensions of the poem, apparently after the fatal
process of additions and interpolations had gone on for centuries. We
are informed that the poem consists of six Books and a Supplemental
Book; and that it comprises 500 cantos and 24,000 couplets. And we are
also told in this Supplemental Book that the descendants of Rama and his
brothers founded some of the great towns and states which, we know from
other sources, flourished in the fifth and fourth centuries before
Christ. It is probable therefore that the Epic, commenced after 1000
B.C., had assumed something like its present shape a few centuries
before the Christian Era.

The foregoing account of the genesis and growth of the *Ramayana* will
indicate in what respects it resembles the *Maha-Bharata*, and in what
respects the two Indian Epics differ from each other. The *Maha-Bharata*
grew out of the legends and. traditions of a great historical war
between the Kurus and the Panchalas; the *Ramayana* grew out of the
recollections of the golden age of the Kosalas and the Videhas. The
characters of the *Maha-bharata* are characters of flesh and blood, with
the virtues and crimes of great actors in the historic world; the
characters of the *Ramayana* are more often the ideals of manly devotion
to truth, and of womanly faithfulness and love in domestic life. The
poet of the *Maha-Bharata* relies on the real or supposed incidents of a
war handed down from generation to generation in songs and ballads, and
weaves them into an immortal work of art the poet of the *Ramayana*
conjures up the memories of a golden age, constructs lofty ideals of
piety and faith, and describes with infinite pathos domestic scones and
domestic affections which endear the work to modern Hindus. As an heroic
poem the *Maha-Bharata* stands on a higher level; as a poem delineating
the softer emotions of our everyday life the *Ramayana* sends its roots
deeper into the hearts and minds of the million in India.

These remarks will be probably made clearer by a comparison of what may
be considered parallel passages in two great Epics In heroic
description, the bridal of Sita is poor and commonplace, compared with
the bridal of Draupadi with all the bustle and tumult of a real contest
among warlike suitors. The rivalry between Rama and Ravan, between
Lakshman and Indrajit, is feeble in comparison with the lifelong
jealousy and hatred which animated Arjun and Kama, Bhima and Duryodban.
Sita's protest and defiance, spoken to Ravan when he carried her away,
lack the fire and the spirit of Draupadi's appeal on the occasion when
she was insulted in court. The Council of War held by Ravan is a poor
affair in comparison with the Council of War held by Yudhisthir in the
Matsya kingdom. And Bibhishan's final appeal for peace and Ravan's
scornful reply will scarcely compare with the sublime eloquence with
which Krishna implored the old monarch of the Kurus not to plunge into a
disastrous war, and the deep determination with which Duryodhan
replied:-

"Town nor village, mart nor hamlet, help us righteous Gods in heaven,  
Spot that needle's point can cover shall not unto them be given!"

In the whole of the *Ramayana* there is no character with the fiery
determination and the deep-seated hatred for the foe which inspire Kama
or Arjun, Bhima or Duryodhan. And in the unending battles waged by Rama
and his allies there is no incident so stirring, so animated, so
thrilling, as the fall of Abhimanyu, the vengeance of Arjun, the final
contest between Arjun and Kama, or the final contest between Bhima and
Duryo dhan. The whole tenor of the *Ramayana* is subdued and calm,
pacific and pious; the whole tenor of the *Maha-Bharata* is warlike and
spirited.

And yet, without rivalling the heroic grandeur of the *Maha-bharata*,
the *Ramayana* is immeasurably superior in its delineation of those
softer and perhaps deeper emotions which enter into our everyday life
and hold the world together. And these descriptions, essentially of
Hindu life, are yet so true to nature that they apply to all races and
nations.

There is something indescribably touching and tender in the description
of the love of Rama for his subjects and the loyalty of his people
towards Rama,--that loyalty which has ever been a part of the Hindu
character in every age--

As a father to his children to his loving men he came,  
Blessed our homes and maids and matrons till our infants lisped his
name,

For our humble woes and troubles Rama hath the ready tear,  
To our humble tales of suffering Rama lends his willing ear!"

Deeper than this was Rama's duty towards his father and his father's
fondness for Rama; and the portion of the Epic which narrates the dark
scheme by which the prince was at last torn from the heart and home of
his dying father is one of the most powerful and pathetic passages in
Indian literature. The stepmother of Rama, won by the virtues and the
kindliness of the prince, regards his proposed coronation with pride and
pleasure, but her old nurse creeps into her confidence like a creeping
serpent, and envenoms her heart with the poison of her own wickedness.
She arouses the slumbering jealousy of a woman and awakens the alarms of
a mother, till--

"Like a slow but deadly poison worked the ancient nurse's tears,  
And a wife's undying impulse mingled with a mother's fears!"

The nurse's dark insinuations work on the mind of the queen till she
becomes a desperate woman, resolved to maintain her own influence on her
husband, and to see her own son on the throne. The determination of the
young queen tells with terrible effeect on the weakness and vacillation
of the feeble old monarch, and Rama is banished at last. And the scene
closes with a pathetic story in which the monarch recounts his misdeed
of past years, accepts his present suffering as the fruit of that
misdeed, and dies in agony for his banished son. The inner workings of
the human; heart and of human motives, the dark intrigue of a scheming
dependant, the awakening jealousy and alarm of a wife and a mother, the
determination of a woman and an imperious queen, and the feebleness and
despair and death of a fond old father and husband,, have never been
more vividly described. Shakespeare himself has not depicted the
workings of stormy passions in the human heart more graphically or more
vividly, with greater truth or with more terrible power.

It is truth and power in the depicting of such scenes, and not in the
delineation of warriors and warlike incidents, that. the *Ramayana*
excels. It is in the delineation of domestic incidents, domestic
affections, and domestic jealousies, which are appreciated by the prince
and the peasant alike, that the *Ramayana* bases its appeal to the
hearts of the million in India. And beyond all this, the righteous
devotion of Rama, and the faith fulness and womanly love of Sita, run
like two threads of gold through the whole fabric of the Epic, and
ennoble and sanctify the work in the eyes of Hindus,

Rama and Sita are the Hindu ideals of a Perfect Man and a Perfect Woman;
their truth under trials and temptations, their endurance under
privations, and their devotion to duty under all vicissitudes of
fortune, form the Hindu ideal of a Perfect Life. In this respect the
*Ramayana* gives us a true picture of Hindu faith and righteous life as
Dante's "Divine Comedy" gives us a picture of the faith and belief of
the Middle Ages in Europe. Our own ideals in the present day may not be
the ideals of the tenth century before Christ or the fourteenth century
after Christ; but mankind will not willingly let die those great
creations of the past which shadow forth the ideals and beliefs of
interesting periods in the progress of human civilisation.

Sorrow and suffering, trial and endurance, are a part of the Hindu ideal
of a Perfect Life of righteousness. Rama suffers for fourteen years in
exile, and is chastened by privations and misfortunes, before he ascends
the throne of his father. In a humble way this course of training was
passed through by every pious Hindu of the ancient times. Every Aryan
boy in India was taken away from his parents at an early age, and lived
the hard life of an anchorite under his teacher for twelve or
twenty-four or thirty-six years, before he entered the married life and
settled down as a householder. Every Aryan boy assumed the rough garment
and the staff and girdle of a student, lived as a mendicant and begged
his food from door to door, attended on his preceptor as a menial, and
thus trained himself in endurance and suffering as well as in the
traditional learning of the age, before he became a house holder. The
pious Hindu saw in Rama's life the ideal of a true Hindu life, the
success and the triumph which follow upon endurance and faith and
devotion to duty. It is the truth and endurance of Rama under sufferings
and privations which impart the deepest lessons to the Hindu character,
and is the highest ideal of a Hindu righteous life. The ancient ideal
may seem to us far-fetched in these days, but we can never fully
comprehend the great moral Epic of the Hindus unless we endeavour to
study fully and clearly its relations of old Hindu ideas and old Hindu
life.

And if trial and endurance are a part of a Hindu's ideal of a man's
life, devotion and self-abnegation are still more essentially a part of
his ideal of a woman's life. Sita holds a place in the hearts Of women
in India which no other creation of a poet's imagination holds among any
other nation on earth. There is not a Hindu man whose earliest and
tenderest recollections do not cling round the story of Sita's
sufferings and Sita's faithfulness, told in the nursery, taught in the
family circle, remembered and cherished through life. Sita's adventures
in a desolate forest and in a hostile prison only represent in an
exaggerated form the humbler trials of a woman's life; and Sita's
endurance and faithfulness teach her devotion to duty in all trials and
troubles of life. "For," said Sita:

For my mother often taught me and my father often spake,  
That her home the wedded woman doth beside her husband make,  
As the shadow to the substance, to her lord is faithful wife,  
And she parts not from her consort till she parts with fleeting life!  
Therefore bid me seek the jungle and in pathless forests roam,  
Where the wild deer freely ranges and the tiger makes his home,  
Happier than in father's mansions in the woods will Sita rove,  
Waste no thought on home or kindred, nestling in her husband's love!"

The ideal of life was joy and beauty and gladness in ancient Greece; the
ideal of life was piety and endurance and devotion in ancient India. The
tale of Helen was a tale of womanly beauty and loveliness which charmed
the western World. The tale of Sita was a tale of womanly faith and
self-abnegation which charmed and fascinated the Hindu world. Repeated
trials bring out in brighter relief the unfaltering truth of Sita's
character; she goes to a second banishment in the woods with the same
trust and devotion to her lord as before, and she returns once more, and
sinks into the bosom of her Mother Earth, true in death as she had been
true in life. The creative imagination of the Hindus has conceived no
loftier and holier character than Sita; the literature of the world has
not produced a higher ideal of womanly love, womanly truth, and womanly
devotion.

The modern reader will now comprehend why India produced, and has
preserved for well-nigh three thousand years, two Epics instead of one
national Epic. No work of the imagination abides long unless it is
animated by some sparks of imperishable truth, unless it truly embodies
some portion of our human feelings, human faith, and human life. The
*Maha-Bharata* depicts the political life of ancient India, with all its
valour and heroism, ambition and lofty chivalry. The *Ramayana* embodies
the domestic and religious life of ancient India, with all its
tenderness and sweetness, its endurance and devotion. The one picture
without the other were in complete; and we should know but little of the
ancient Hindus if we did not comprehend their inner life and faith as
well as their political life and their Warlike virtues. The two together
give us a true and graphic picture of ancient Indian life and
civilisation; and no nation on earth has preserved a more faithful
picture of its glorious past.

In condensing the *Ramayana* with its more than 24,000 Sanscrit couplets
into 2,000 English couplets I have followed the same plan which was
adopted in my translation of the Maha-Bharata. I have selected those
sections or cantos which tell the leading incidents of the Epic, and
have translated the whole or main portions of them, and these selected
passages are linked together by short notes. The plan, as was explained
before, has this advantage, that the story is told not by the translator
in his own way, but by the poet himself the passages placed before the
reader are not the translator's abridgment of a long poem, but selected
passages from the poem itself. It is the ancient poet of India, and not
the translator, who narrates the old story; but he narrates only such
portions of it as describe the leading incidents. We are told that the
sons of Rama recited the whole poem of 24,000 verses, divided into 500
cantos or sections, in twenty-five days. The modern reader has not the
patience of the Hindu listener of the old school; but a selection of the
leading portions of that immortal song, arranged in 2,000 verses and in
84 short sections, may possibly receive a hearing, even from the
much-distracted modern reader.

While speaking of my own translation I must not fail to make some
mention of my predecessors in this work. The magnificent edition of the
*Ramayana* (Bengal recension), published with an Italian translation by
Gorresio, at the expense of Charles Albert King of Sardinia in 1843-67,
first introduced this great Epic to the European public; and it was not
long before M. Hippolyte Fauche presented the European world with a
French translation of this edition. The Benares recension of the
Ramayana has since been lithographed in Bombay, and a printed edition of
the same recension with Ramanuja's commentary was brought out by the
venerable Hem Chandra Vidyaratna in Calcutta in 1869-85. The talented
and indefatigable Mr. Ralph Griffith, C.I.E., who has devoted a lifetime
to translating Indian poetry into English, has produced an almost
complete translation of the first six Books in more than 24,000 English
couplets, and has given an abstract of the seventh Book in prose. And a
complete translation of the *Ramayana* into English prose has since
appeared in Calcutta.

The object of the present work is very different from that of these
meritorious editions and translations. The purpose of this work, as
explained above, is not to attempt a complete translation of a
voluminous Epic, but to place before the general reader the leading
story of that Epic by translating a number of selected passages and
connecting them together by short notes. The purpose of this volume is
not to repeat the long poem which Rama's sons are supposed to have
recited in 24,000 Sanscrit couplets, but only to narrate the main
incidents of that poem within the reasonable limit of 2,000 verses. And
the general reader who seeks for a practical acquaintance with the great
Indian poem within a reason able compass will, it is hoped, find in this
book a handy and not unacceptable translation of the leading story of
the Epic.

I have stated before that in India the *Ramayana* is still a living
tradition and a living faith. It forms the basis of the moral
instruction of a nation, and it is a part of the lives of two hundred
millions of people. It is necessary to add that when the modern
languages of India were first formed out of the ancient Sanscrit and
Prakrits, in the ninth and tenth centuries after Christ, the Ramayana
had the greatest influence in inspiring our modern poets and forming our
modern tongues. Southern India took the lead, and a translation of the
Ramayana in the Tamil language appeared as early as A.D. 1100. Northern
India and Bengal and Bombay followed the example; Tulasi Das's
*Ramayana* is the great classic of the Hindi language, Krittibas's
*Ramayana* is a classic in the Bengali language, and Sridhar's
*Ramayana* is a classic in the Mahratta language. Generations of Hindus
in all parts of India have studied the ancient story in these modern
translations; they have heard it recited in the houses of the rich; and
they have seen it acted on the stage at religious festivals in every
great town and every populous village through the length and breadth of
India.

More than this, the story of Rama has inspired our religious reformers,
and purified the popular faith of our modern times. Rama, the true and
dutiful, was accepted as the Spirit of God descended on earth, as an
incarnation of Vishnu the Preserver of the World. The great teacher
Ramanuja proclaimed the monotheism of Vishnu in Southern India in the
twelfth century; the reformer Ramananda proclaimed the same faith in
Northern India in the thirteenth or fourteenth century; and his follower
the gifted Kabir conceived the bold idea of uniting Hindus and
Mahomedans. in the worship of One God. "The God of the Hindus," he said,
is the God of the Mahomedans, be he invoked as *Rama* or *Ali*." "The
city of the Hindu God is Benares, and the city of the Mahomedan God is
Mecca; but search your hearts, and there you will find the God both of
Hindus and Mahomedans." "If the Creator dwells in tabernacles, whose
dwelling is the universe?"

The reformer Chaitanya preached the same sublime monotheism in Bengal,
and the reformer Nanak in the Punjab, in the sixteenth century. And down
to the present day the popular mind in India, led away by the worship of
many images in many temples, nevertheless holds fast to the cardinal
idea of One God, and believes the heroes of the ancient Epics-Krishna
and Rama-to be the incarnations of that God. The various sects of the
Hindus, specially the sects of Vishnu and of Siva who form the great
majority of the people, quarrel about a name as they often did in Europe
in the Middle Ages, and each sect gives to the Deity the special name by
which the sect is known. In the teeming villages of Bengal, in the
ancient shrines of Northern India, and far away in the towns and hamlets
of Southern India, the prevailing faith of the million is a popular
monotheism underlying the various ceremonials in honour of various
images and forms-and that popular monotheism generally recognises the
heroes of the two ancient Epics,--Krishna and Rama, as the earthly
incarnations of the great God who pervades and rules the universe.

To know the Indian Epics is to understand the Indian people better. And
to trace the influence of the Indian Epics on the life and civilisation
of the nation, and on the development of their modern languages,
literatures, and religious reforms, is to comprehend the real history of
the people during three thousand years.
