### CHAPTER LXIX.

SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--Raja! I will now relate to you the history of
the marriage of Luchmuna, the daughter of Doorjodhun, how Sumboo went to
Hastinapoor, and married her. O great king! when the Raja Doorjodhun's
daughter, Luchmuna, was marriageable, her father sent letters of
invitation to Rajas of different countries, and appointed a day for the
bride to select her own husband; having received intelligence of the day
that had been appointed, Shree Krishnù Chund's son, by Jamwutee, named
Sumboo, came also to witness the ceremony. On arriving there he beheld
Rajas of all countries powerful, possessed of excellent qualities, the
receptacles of beauty, very intelligent, wearing elegant dresses and
jewelled ornaments, armed and silent, standing in rows in the midst of
the assemblage, and the Kouruvus were standing in like manner behind
them; musical instruments resounded here and there outside; and inside
musicians and singers were engaged in festivities; in the centre of all
the Raja's daughter, the beloved of her mother and father, was moving
about like a pupil of the eye, with a garland in her hand, and saying to
herself, "Whom shall I marry?"

O great king! when that sweet dispositioned girl, the abode of beauty,
carrying a garland, and blushing, came, in the course

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

of her circling, opposite Sumboo, she laid aside all reserve and
bashfulness; and seizing him fearlessly by the hand, and seating him in
her chariot, proceeded homewards. All the Rajas looked on in silent
surprise, and Kurun, Dron, Sulup, Bhoorisurwa, Doorjodhun and the other
Kouruvùs did not at that time say a word; afterwards, being very angry,
they began to say to each other, "See what he has done, spoiling all our
pleasure, and making a happy occasion disagreeable!" Kurun said, "It is
the constant practice of the descendants of Judoo to do acts of violence
on occasions of pleasure, and rejoicing." Suti said, "They are men of
low caste, who have lately been exalted; since they obtained
sovereignty, they have become insolent and domineering." On hearing
these words, all the Kouruvùs in great wrath, and seizing their arms,
rushed forth, saying, "Let us see what mighty man will take way the girl
from before us," and they went and surrounded Sumboo on the road.
Warlike weapons were brought into play on both sides, when at length the
battle had lasted some time, and Sumboo's charioteer had been killed,
and he himself had descended from his chariot, they surrounded and
carried him away bound, making him stand up in the middle of the.
assembly, they enquired, "Where is thy mighty power now gone?" He was
ashamed at hearing this; at this time, Narud Jee having come, said to
Doorjodhun and all the Kouruvùs, "This is Shree Krishnù's son, by name
Sumboo; do not say any thing to him, whatever was to happen, has
happened, Shree Krishnù and Bulram will come here with an army, prepared
for battle, immediately they receive intelligence of him, whatever you
have to say to him or hear from him, say and hear it; it is not at all
becoming to taunt a child, whatever act his boyish understanding may
have done."

O great king! having thus spoken, Narud Jee took leave and proceeded to
the city of Dwarka, and went and stood in the court of the Raja
Oogursen; they all rose at seeing him and bowed their heads, and
instantly brought a seat for him.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Narud Jee when
seated said, "O great king! the Kouruvùs have bound Sumboo, and have
inflicted, and are still inflicting, great pain upon him. If you wish to
take thought of him, do so now; otherwise it will be difficult for
Sumboo to escape. The Kouruvùs have become very proud, and have shown no
respect or consideration for you, they have bound the child in a manner
that any one would bind an enemy." Raja Oogursen was very angry at
hearing this, and having summoned the descendants of Judoo, said to
them, Take all my army and advance against Hustinapoor, and having
killed the Kouruvùs, release and bring Sumboo here." When the army was
ready to set out on receiving the Raja's order, Bulram Jee went to
explain to the Raja Oogursen, and said, "O great king! do not send an
army against them; with your permission, I will go and complain to them
and will have Sumboo released, and will bring him away with me; I will
see why they have bound him; unless I go, the reason of this act will
not appear." Upon this the Raja Oogursen gave Bulram Jee permission to
go to Hustinapoor; and Buldeo Jee went from Dwarka, accompanied by
several great pundits, brahmins and by Narud, the sage, and arrived at
Hustinapoor. Bulram on his arrival, having encamped on a piece of
enclosed ground, said to Narud Jee, "O great king! we have encamped
here; please go and inform the Kouruvùs of my arrival." On receiving
this order, Narud Jee went to the city and gave information of Bulram's
arrival; having heard this news they all prepared to go out and meet
him. Bheekum, Kurun and Dron went together, taking handsome cloth
dresses as presents. Doorjodhun went hastily forth, saying, "My
spiritual preceptor, Sunburkhun, has come."

Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the
Raja,--O great king! all the Kouruvùs went to the enclosure where Bulram
was encamped to visit him, and offered him presents; and, having fallen
at his feet, joining

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

their hands, eulogized him highly; after this having applied perfume and
sandal, and putting a garland of flowers upon him, and spreading silken
cloths, they conducted him, in musical procession, to the city; they
then entertained him with all kinds of delicacies; and, sitting near
him, made various enquiries, "O great king! why have you come here?"
Bulram Jee replied, "I have been sent by the Raja Oogursen to deliver a
message to you." The Kouruvùs said, "What message?" Buldeo Jee replied,
"The Raja says, that it was not becoming in you to do an act of enmity
towards him: you were many and he a single child; you fought with him,
abandoning all understanding and discrimination; you intentionally
committed a great injustice, and, relinquishing respect for the world,
laid hold of Krishnù's son; you have now become very proud, and have
designedly afflicted him." O great king! on hearing these words the
Kouruvùs said, very angrily, "Enough! enough! Bulram Jee, do not exalt
Oogursen any more, as we will not listen to you; it is scarcely four
days, since no one knew or respected Oogursen; from the time he
connected himself with us he has obtained high rank, and has now sent us
a haughty message: is he not ashamed, considering that he obtained
sovereign power sitting quietly at Dwarka, to forget entirely his former
condition, and now to say whatever he pleases? Does he forget the day,
when he used to associate and eat with cowherds and Goojurs at Muttra?
We have now reaped the fruits of allowing him to eat with us, and
forming an alliance with him, and procuring sovereign power for him. If
we had done these good acts to a respectable man, he would have been
thankful for them all his life; some one has said truly, 'That the
friendship of a mean person is like a wall of sand.'"

Having proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O
great king! discoursing much in this strain, Kurun, Dron, Bheekum,
Doorjodhun and all the Kuoruvùs rose haughtily and went to their homes.
Bulram Jee laughing at

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

what they had said, thought to himself, "They are proud of their royal
power and strength, and, therefore speak in this strain; otherwise,
would they treat with such disrespect that Oogursen, who is the lord of
Bruhmù, Roodrù and Indrù, to whom the three bow their heads? As my name
is Buldeo, I will drown all the Kouruvùs with their city in the Ganges."

O great king! having thus said, Buldeo Jee in great wrath laid hold of
all the Kouruvùs and their city with his plough, and took them to a bank
of the Ganges, and was on the point of drowning them, when all the
Kouruvùs came in the greatest alarm and consternation, with joined
hands, bowing their heads, and beseeching earnestly, began to say, in a
submissive tone, "O great king! forgive our fault; we have come to you
for protection, save us now, and we will do whatever you may order, and
will be always obedient to the commands of Raja Oogursen."

When, O great king! they had thus spoken, the wrath of Bulram Jee was
appeased, and he allowed the city to remain on the site, to which, with
his plough, he had drawn it, on the banks of the Ganges. From that day
Hustinapoor has been on the banks of the Ganges, formerly it was not
there; he afterwards released Sumboo, and Raja Doorjodhun, having
propitiated his uncle and nephews, and taken them to his house, prepared
a festive entertainment, and gave his daughter in marriage to Sumboo
according to the prescribed injunctions of the Vedas; and presented her
with a very handsome dowry.

Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O
great king; thus did Bulram Jee go to Hustinapoor, lower the pride of
the Kouruvùs, release his nephew and bring him home after his marriage.
At that time there was joy in all the city of Dwarka; and Buldea Jee
went and explained to the Raja Oogursen all the circumstances connected
with Hustinapoor.
