### CHAPTER LXVII.

SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! there was a Raja, named Pounrik,
in the city of Kasee, a very powerful and glorious monarch, who assumed
the appearance of Vishnù and imposed upon all people by deceit and
force; he constantly wore a yellow dress, a necklace composed of five
jewels, produced from the elements of nature, a garland of pearls, and a
garland, composed of various jewels; and carrying about with him a
shell, quoit, club and lotus, he made two wooden hands for himself; and
having placed upon a horse a wooden sovereign of the feathered race, he
went about, mounted upon it. He called himself Basoodeo Pounrik, and
caused himself to be worshipped by all men; whatsoever Raja did not obey
his order, he attacked him; and, having fought, reduced him to
subjection.

Having narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee
said,--Raja! seeing and hearing of his practices, people began to say in
every country, city, village and house, "One Basoodeo has appeared in
the country of Bruj, in the family of Judoo, and he dwells in the city
of Dwarka, another has now come to Kasee, which of the two shall we look
upon and respect as the true one?" Such was the talk in every country;
when, having made some discovery, Basoodeo Pounrik

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

came one day into his own court, and said, "Who is Krishnù that lives at
Dwarka, whom the world calls Basoodeo? He has come upon the earth for
the sake of his worshippers, and has there assumed an appearance like
mine." Having thus spoken, he sent for a messenger; and, entering into
very minute explanations with him, despatched him to Dwarka to Shree
Krishnù Chund Jee, saying, "Tell all persons, who are wandering about in
an appearance like mine, to relinquish that appearance and if they do
not relinquish it, prepare to fight with them." On receiving the order
the messenger, taking leave, started from Kasee, and arrived at the city
of Dwarka; and appeared in the court of Shree Krishnù Chund Jee. Krishnù
asked him, "Who he was, and whence he had come?" He replied, "I am a
messenger of Raja Pounrik, of the city of Kasee, I am come to deliver a
message to you from my master, which, with your permission, I will
mention." Shree Krishnù Chund granted permission. When he had done so,
the messenger standing up with joined hands, began to say, "O great
king! Basoodeo Pounrik says, 'That he is lord of the three worlds and
creator of the universe, and asks who you are, who having assumed his
appearance, and fled from fear of Joorasindhoo, have come to live at
Dwarka; you must either immediately give over imitating him in outward
appearance and seek his protection; or he will come and destroy you,
together with all the descendants of Judoo; and, having removed the
burthens of the earth, will cherish his own worshippers, I am Pounrik,
the unseen, the invisible, the without form; gods, sages, saints and men
offer prayers, penance, sacrifice and gifts continually to me. I, as
Bruhmù, am the creator, as Vishnù, the preserver, and as Shivù, the
destroyer. In the form of a fish I rescued the sinking Vedas, in the
form of a tortoise I supported a hill, as a boar I upheld the earth,
descending upon the earth as half man and half lion, I destroyed the
demon Hirunkusyp, in the incarnation

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

of a dwarf, I deceived Bull, when I descended as Ram, I destroyed the
great devil, Rawun. This is my occupation, that, whenever demons vex my
worshippers, I descend upon the earth, and remove its burthens.'"

Having narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the
Raja Pureechit,--O great king! the messenger of Basoodeo Pounrik was
thus speaking, and Shree Krishnù Chund, the root of joy, seated on a
jewelled throne amidst an assemblage of Judoos was listening and
laughing, when one of the descendants of Judoo exclaimed, "Has the
regent of the dead come to take thee away, that thou speakest thus; we
will kill thee, thou low wretch! Thou hast come as the go-between of a
deceitful man; if you were not an ambassador, we would certainly put you
to death, it is not right to kill a messenger."

O great king! when the descendants of Judoo had thus spoken, Shree
Krishnù Jee, having called that messenger, explained to him and said,
"Go and tell thy Basoodeo, that Krishnù says, that he is about to give
up imitating thy appearance, and to seek an asylum with thee, be
prepared."

On hearing these words the messenger made a salutation, and took leave;
and Shree Krishnù Chund Jee also set out with his army for the city of
Kasee. The messenger went and said to Basoodeo Pounrik, "O great king! I
have been to Dwarka, and delivered the whole of the message you charged
me with to Shree Krishnù; and on hearing it he said, 'Go and tell thy
master to be prepared, as I am about to give up imitating his
appearance, and to seek an asylum with him.'"

O great king! whilst the ambassador was still speaking, some one came
and said, "O great king! why are you sitting thus unconcerned? Shree
Krishnù has advanced with his army." In hearing this, Basoodeo Pounrik
came forth with his whole army in his assumed appearance; and,
proceeding onwards, came in front of Shree Krishnù Chund Jee. Another

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Raja of Kasee came
also with him; on both sides the armies were arranged in battle order:
the warlike instruments began to sound, the brave, the resolute and the
heroical began to fight; and cowards, leaving the field, to run for
their lives; at that time Basoodeo Pounrik continuing to fight and being
in the hands of death, went in his assumed form in front of Shree
Krishnù Chund Jee, and challenged him. On seeing him in that counterfeit
dress, the descendants of Judoo said to Shree Krishnù Chund, "O great
king! how shall we kill him in this likeness?" Krishnù said, "It is no
crime to kill a deceitful man in that likeness."

Having thus spoken, Huri gave the order to the quoit, Soodursun, who
went and plucked out his two wooden arms; the wooden sovereign of the
feathered race was broken at the same time, and the horse ran away; when
Basoodeo Pounrik fell Soodursun cut off his head, and threw it away. On
his head being cut off the Raja Pounrik was released from existence; his
head fell in the city of Kasee, where his seraglio was, and his wives
saw it; they wept and tore their hair, saying, "Who was the author of
this deed? You were not subject to decrepitude and were immortal. How
has your soul departed in a second?"

O great king! on hearing the lamentations of the Raja's wives, a son of
his, named Soodukoch, came there, and seeing his father's head, which
had been cut off, was greatly enraged and began to say, "I will not rest
without revenging myself on him who has slain my father."

Having proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee, said,--O
great king! having destroyed Basoodeo Pounrik, Shree Krishnù Chund Jee
returned with all his army to Dwarka, and the Raja's son, with a view of
revenging his father's death, began to perform a very difficult penance
to Muhadeo Jee. When he had been engaged some days in this penance,
Muhadeo Bholanath came one day highly delighted, and said, "Ask a boon
from me." The Raja's son said, "O great king! grant me this boon, that I
may be revenged on

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shree Krishnù for
my father's death." Shivù Jee replied, "Very good, if you desire
revenge, adopt this plan." He said, "What plan?" Shivù replied, "Offer a
sacrifice, repeating the incantations of the Vedas backwards, a female
devil will come forth from the fire, who will do whatever you tell her."
When Shivù Jee had thus spoken, the Raja's son, O great king! sent for
brahmins, and having built an altar, and taking sesamum, ghee, barley,
sugar and other requisites for the sacrifice and mixing them up
together, began to offer sacrifice, repeating the incantations of the
Vedas backwards. At length, whilst he was engaged in the sacrifice, a
female devil, named Kritya, came forth from the hole, in which the
consecrated fire was received, who, burning all the cities and villages,
and the whole country in rear of Shree Krishnù Jee, arrived at the city
of Dwarka, and began to set the city on fire. Seeing the city in flames,
all the descendants of Judoo went in consternation to Shree Krishnù.
Chund Jee, and called out, "O great king! how shall we escape from this
fire, it is burning down the whole city?" Krishnù. replied, "Be not at
all alarmed, this is a female devil, named Kritya, who has come from
Kasee, I will immediately make arrangements with regard to her."

O great king! having thus spoken, Shree Krishnù. Jee gave the order to
the quoit, Soodursun, to attack and put her to flight, and to go at
once, and set fire to the city of Kasee. On receiving Huri's order, the
quoit, Soodursun, put to flight and destroyed Kritya, and went
forthwith, and set Kasee on fire, The inhabitants fled from place to
place in great distress; and bitterly abused Soodukoch. The quoit
returned, after having fired the city, and came, and told Krishnù.
