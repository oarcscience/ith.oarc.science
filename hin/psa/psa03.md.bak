### CHAPTER II.

HAVING narrated so much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the
Raja Pureechit,--O great king! Kuns continued to rule tyrannically in
Muttra, and Oogursen to be afflicted with many griefs--When Dewukee, the
daughter of Dewuk, Kuns' uncle, was fit for marriage, Dewuk went to
Kuns, and asked him to whom she should be given in marriage; he replied,
give her to Basoodeo, the son of Soorsen. On hearing this, Dewuk having
sent for a Brahmin, and having fixed upon a fortunate time, sent the
nuptial gifts to Soorsen's house; and Soorsen also having formed a
marriage procession with great splendour, and taking with him Rajas of
all countries, came to Basoodeo's marriage. Having heard of the arrival
of the marriage procession near the city, Oogursen, Dewuk and Kuns,
taking their armies with them; and advancing to meet it brought the
procession with them into the city. Having advanced to meet the
bridegroom with the greatest respect, they appointed a place in the
bride's house for the reception of him and his attendants; having
entertained all who composed the marriage procession, they seated them
in a hall, erected for the occasion, and adorned with flowers; and Kuns
gave away Dewukee to Basoodeo in the manner prescribed by the Vedas, and
bestowed a dowry of fifteen thousand horses, four thousand elephants,
eighteen hundred ruths or cars, numerous male and female servants, and
golden dishes, or trays filled with dresses ornamented with jewels
without number; and Kuns gave jewelled dresses also to all who composed
the

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

marriage procession. After this, all assembled to escort the procession
to Basoodeo's house, upon which there was a voice from heaven, saying,
"O Kuns, the eighth son of her whom you are escorting shall be your
destruction, you shall die by his hand."

On hearing this, Kuns trembled with fear, and being enraged, seizing
Dewukee by the hair, he dragged her from her ruth: snatching a sword, he
began to say, gnashing his teeth, "The tree which is plucked up by the
roots will not produce blossoms and fruits; I will now put her to death,
and reign without fear."

On hearing and seeing what had happened, Basoodeo began to say to
himself, "This fool has given pain, he does not distinguish between good
and evil; if I should show rage now, the business in hand would be
ruined; wherefore, it is better in the present instance to forgive; it
is said, that, 'when an enemy draws a sword, a virtuous man will strive
to soothe him; the fool on coming to his senses will regret his conduct,
just as fire is put out by water.'"

Reflecting thus, Basoodeo went into the presence of Kuns, and joining
his hands in a supplicating manner, and speaking submissively began to
say, "O lord of the earth! there is no one in the world so powerful as
you, and all men live under your shadow; being so great a hero, it is
very improper that you should raise your sword against a woman, and it
is a great crime to kill a sister--men will be guilty of injustice, if
they know that they will never die: this is the custom of the world, we
are born in one place, and die in another: a man may cherish his body by
doing good or evil in ten million different ways, but his body will
never be at his own disposal: wealth, poverty, royal power will be of no
use; for this reason, be pleased to listen to what I say, and release
your poor, weak sister."

On hearing this, Kuns, looking upon his sister as the instrument of his
death, was alarmed, and became more enraged.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Upon this Basoodeo
thought within himself, "This sinner, with the mind of a devil, is
obstinately determined to follow out his own plans; we must take
measures, by which Dewukee may be rescued from his hands." Reflecting
thus, he began to say to himself, "I will save Dewukee by saying to
Kuns, that I will give him every son of her's, that is born; who has
seen the future, there may not be a child, or this devil may die? The
present crisis is before us, we can take measures for the future
hereafter."

Having resolved upon this, Basoodeo said to Kuns, "O great king! your
death shall not be caused by the hand of any son of her's, because I
have determined that I will bring and deliver over to you all the sons
she, Dewukee, may have: this I promise you." When Basoodeo had thus
spoken, Kuns consented to what he had proposed, and releasing Dewukee,
began to say, "O Basoodeo! you have thought well in saving me from the
commission of so great a crime;" saying this, Kuns dismissed him, and
himself returned home.

After dwelling some days in Muttra, when Dewukee had her first son,
Basoodeo took it, and weeping placed it before Kuns; on seeing the
infant, Kuns exclaimed, "Basoodeo! you are very true to your word; I
have had reason to know this to-day, because you have not deceived me;
sacrificing all your affections, you have brought and given your child
to me, I have no fear from it; I therefore give the child back to you."
Hearing this, Basoodeo took the child, and making a salutation to Kuns,
returned home.

And at that time Narud Jee, the sage, went to Kuns and said, "Raja! why
have you given the infant back? Do you not know that all the gods have
been born, and come to Bruj to serve Basoodeo; and in the eighth
pregnancy of Dewukee, Shree Krishnù being born, and having put all
devils to death, will remove all the burthens of the world?" Saying
this, Narud Jee drew eight lines, and counted them: when in eight
countings, each in turn was the eighth, Kuns

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

being alarmed sent for Basoodeo and the child. Narud, the sage,
departed, after having thus informed Kuns, who took the infant from
Basoodeo, and put it to death.--In this manlier, whenever a son was
born, Basoodeo brought it to Kuns, and he destroyed it. Six infants were
thus killed, when Shree Bhugwan, in the form of the great serpent,
Shesh, took up his abode in the seventh pregnancy.

On the hearing this, the Raja Pureechit said to Shookdeo the sage, "O
great king! give me some account of Narud, the sage, who was the cause
of so many crimes being committed, in order that the doubts of my mind
may disappear." Shree Shookdeo replied, "Raja! Narud Jee thought
rightly, that Kuns would commit very many crimes, in consequence of
which Shree Bhugwan would speedily appear upon the earth."
