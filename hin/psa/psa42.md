### CHAPTER XLI.

SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! whilst Akroor was standing in
the water, and meditating for some time on Krishnû, he obtained
knowledge; and joining his hands, and making obeisance, began to say to
Krishnù, "You are the divinity, both creator and destroyer; and having
come into the world for the sake of your worshippers, you assume endless
forms and shapes; and gods, men and sages are particles of you. Being
manifested from you, they are contained in you, as water is contained in
the sea, having issued from the sea! Your greatness is incomparable! Who
can describe it? You remain constantly in the form of the embodied
spirit? The heaven is your head, the earth your feet, the sea your
belly, the atmosphere, your navel, clouds your hair, trees the hair of
your body, fire your mouth, the ten quarters of the world your ears, the
sun and melon your eyes; Indrù your arm, Bruhmù your intellect, Roodrù
your pride, thunder your speech, air your life, water your seed; day and
night depend on the opening and shutting of your eye-lids. This is the
form, in which you constantly dwell? Who can recognize you?" Akroor,
having thus offered up praises to Krishnû, and meditated upon his feet
said, "O lord of compassion! take me under your protection.
