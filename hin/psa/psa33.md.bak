### CHAPTER XXXII.

SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! all the cowherdesses, sitting on
the bank of the Jumna, and intoxicated with love, began to sing the
exploits and virtues of Huri: "O most beloved! since you came to Bruj,
you have diffused new pleasures there. Luchmee in the hope of your
protection, has corn and taken up her fixed abode. We, cowherdesses, are
your slaves; show compassion, and quickly take thought of us; since we
have seen your elegant, dark-coloured, beautiful form, we have become
your slaves without purchase. The arrows of your eyes have pierced our
breasts. Beloved! in what way and manner are we not yours? Have mercy on
us, as our lives are ebbing out. Lay aside relentlessness, and be
pleased to present yourself soon to our sight. If your wish was to
destroy us, why did you save us from the poisonous serpent, from fire
and from inundation; why not have allowed us then to die? You are not
merely Jusodha's son. Bruhmù, Roodrù, Indrù and all the gods, humbling
themselves before you, have brought you on the earth for the protection
of the world.

"O lord of life! it is a subject of great wonder to us, whom you will
preserve, if you destroy your own! Beloved! your are acquainted with the
secrets of the heart; why do you not put

an end to our affliction, and grant the accomplishment of our hopes!
What, beloved! do you wish to display your heroism towards us weak
women? What pain do we not suffer, when we behold your gentle smile,
your affectionate glance, the bend of your eye-brows, the coquetry of
your eyes, the undulating motion of your neck, and the splendour of your
discourse? And when you used to go to the jungle to give pasture to the
cows, the stones and thorns of the forest gave pain to our minds when we
thought of your soft feet. You went early in the morning, and returned
in the evening: but still these four puhurs appeared to us like four
ages. When sitting in your presence, we gazed on your elegant form, we
thought in our minds, that Bruhmù was very foolish in having formed the
eye-lid, to prevent our fixed and uninterrupted gaze."

Having told so much of the story, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king!
the cowherdesses, distressed at their separation from Krishnù, continued
in this disconsolate manner to sing his exploits, and were worn out by
their exertions in doing so; but still Beharee did not come.

At length, being utterly without hope, and giving up all expectation of
living, they became quite senseless from total want of resolution; and
falling down, wept so violently and with such lamentations, that all
things, animate and inanimate, on hearing them, were very much
afflicted.
