### CHAPTER LIII.

SHREE SHOOKDEO, the sage, said,--O great king! hear the progress of the
history. When Shree Krishnù Chund, the root of joy, came to Dwarka,
after having slain Kaljumun, released Moochkoond, deceived Joorasindhoo,
accompanied by Buldeo Jee, life was revived in all the descendants of
Judoo; and joy was diffused over the whole city: the inhabitants began
to enjoy ease and happiness.

Sometime after this, several of the descendants of Judoo went one day to
the Raja Oogursen and said, "O great king! it is now necessary to make
some arrangements for Bulram Jee's marriage, because he is of a
marriageable age."

On hearing these words, the Raja Oogursen sent for a brahmin, and
entering into many explanations, and giving very particular
instructions, said, "Go and betroth Bulram in some good family."

Having thus spoken, and ordered the mixture rolee, rice, a rupee and a
cocoanut to be brought, Oogursen marked the brahmin's forehead; and
presenting him with the rupee and cocoanut allowed him to depart. He
pursued his journey, and arrived at the abode of the Raja Rewut in the
Anurta country. Having betrothed Bulram Jee to his daughter Rewutee,

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

and fixed upon a favourable moment, he brought the marks for the
forehead by the hands of the Raja's brahmin, and presented them to
Oogursen at Dwarka; and informed him of all that had occurred, while he
was in the Raja's country. The Raja Oogursen was very much pleased with
the account; and, giving a festive entertainment, he sent for the
brahmin, who had brought the marks, and received them from him; and
dismissed him with a large present of money, and afterwards went himself
in great splendour and state, accompanied by all the descendants of
Judoo, to the country of Anurta, and celebrated Bulram Jee's marriage.

Having proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo, the sage,
said to the Raja,--O lord of the earth! in this manner the descendants
of Judoo celebrated Bulram's marriage. And Shree Krishnù Chund Jee,
accompanied by his brother, went to Koondulpore; and having fought with
evil spirits, carried off Rookmunee, the daughter of the Raja Bheekmuk,
who had been betrothed to Sissoopal; and married her at his own home.

Having heard this, the Raja Pureechit enquired from Shree Shookdeo Jee,
"O sea of compassion! how did Shree Krishnù Chund go to Koondulpore, and
slay the evil spirits, and carry off Bheekmuk's daughter, Rookmunee?
Please explain these circumstances to me." Shree Shookdeo Jee replied, O
great king! listen with attention, and I will give you a full account of
all the circumstances.

In the Bidurbh country there was a city, named Koondulpore, the Raja of
which, Bheekmuk, was renowned, and known to fame in all parts of the
world. Shree Seeta Jee descended upon the earth in his house. At the
birth of his daughter, the Raja sent for astrologers, who came, and
having determined upon a fortunate moment, named the child Rookmunee,
and said, "O great king! we are of opinion, that this girl will possess
an excellent disposition, be a receptacle of beauty, and equal Luchmee
in excellent qualities, and be married to the first male, Vishnù."

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

When the astrologers had thus spoken, Raja Bheekmuk was highly pleased,
and indulged in great rejoicings and made many presents to brahmins.
After this, the girl increased daily in stature, like a digit of the
moon; and delighted her parents by her childish play. When she was a
little older, she engaged in all kinds of rare games with her female
companions. One day this young creature, with eyes like a deer, a voice
like the kokila, complexion like the flower chumpa, and a countenance
like the moon, went with her companions to play at blind man's buff.
Whilst engaged in the diversion, her companions said to her, "Rookmunee!
you have come to spoil our sport; because wherever you hide with us in
the dark, there is a flood of light from the brilliancy of your
moon-like countenance, which prevents our being concealed." On hearing
this speech, she smiled and was silent.

Having narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O
great king! she constantly played in this manner with her companions,
and her beauty greatly increased every day. In the mean while Narud Jee
came one day to Koondulpore; and, having seen Rookmunee, went to Shree
Krishnù at Dwarka, and said, "O great king! a young virgin has been born
in the house of the Raja Bheekmuk, who is a mine of beauty and virtue
and excellent qualities, equal to Luchmee, and worthy of being wedded to
you." From the time he heard this account from Narud Jee, Huri thought
of her night and day. In this manner, O great king! Shree Krishnù Chund
heard of the name and excellent qualities of Rookmunee; and I will now
explain how she heard of the fame and celebrity of Krishnù. On one
occasion several beggars from different countries went to Koondulpore,
and sung the celebrated exploits of Krishnù, his birth at Muttra, his
joining with the cowherds' children in childish games at Gokool and.
Brindabun; and how he had made the descendants of Judoo happy by
destroying evil spirits, and removing the burthens of the earth. All
these circumstances they mentioned. On, hearing the

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

recital of Huri's wonderful actions, the inhabitants of the city were
greatly astonished, and said to each other, "When shall we see him, of
whose exploits we have heard." By some means, the beggars contrived to
enter the court of the Raja Bheekmuk, and began to sing of the famous
deeds, and the attributes of Krishnù. At that time the beautiful
Rookmunee had gone up to a balcony; and the voices of the beggars,
reciting Krishnù's exploits, reached her ears. She wondered and was
absent in mind; and turning round and peeping, wanted to see the
beggars. The Raja's daughter, having heard Krishnù's history, remained
absorbed in thought of him; the creeper of love sprung up in her breast;
she was delighted and agitated by turns. Huri stole away her senses,
memory and mind. Shree Shookdeo Jee continued,--O lord of the earth! in
this manner Shree Rookmunee Jee heard of the fame and celebrity of
Krishnù, and from that day she continued to think of him day and night,
during the eight puhurs, and sixty four ghurees; whether asleep or
awake, sitting, standing, walking, eating, drinking or engaged in
amusement; and celebrated his good qualities with songs. She was in the
habit of rising very early, and having bathed, and made a mud image of
the goddess Parbuttee, she put upon it the mixture roolee, rice and
flowers; and preparing perfumes, lamps and consecrated food, propitiated
the goddess with joined hands, and downcast looks, and pronounced these
words in presence of the image, "Take pity on me, O Parbuttee! give me
the lord of the Judoos as a husband, and remove all my troubles." In
this manner Rookmunee passed her life. One day she was amusing herself
with her companions, when the Raja Bheekmuk, beholding her, began to
think and say to himself, "She is now of an age to be married; if we do
not marry her to some one quickly, people will laugh. There is a saying,
that it is useless for a man, in whose house there is a grown-up
unmarried daughter, to offer gifts, or perform good acts, or be engaged
in prayers, or religious penance; because he

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

obtains no benefit from the performance of such acts, until he shall
have discharged the debt due to his daughter." Having thus reflected,
the Raja Bheekmuk came into his court; and, having summoned all his
ministers and relations said, "Brothers! my daughter is marriageable, it
is necessary to look out for a bridegroom for her, of good family, a
"mine of good qualities, an abode of beauty and of a good disposition."

On hearing these words, they mentioned the families, virtues, personal
appearance and power of the Rajas of many different countries; but Raja
Bheekmuk did not approve of any of them. Then his eldest son, named
Rookum, began to say, "Father! Sissoopal, the Raja of the city of
Chunderee, is very powerful, and in every respect our equal, betroth
Rookmunee to him, and gain reputation in the world."

O great king! when the Raja would not acquiesce in his opinion, his
younger son, whose name was Rookumkesh, said, "Father! give Rookmunee to
Krishnù, and betroth her through Basoodeo." Bheekmuk was highly
delighted at these words, and commended his son's speech: "You, although
only a child, are more intelligent than the rest, I approve entirely of
what you have said; there is a saying, enquire from persons of high and
low degree, in order to give confidence to your own judgment; seize upon
what is valuable in the discourse of each; this is the custom of the
world." After this the Raja again said, "Rookumkesh has given good
counsel; amongst the descendants of Judoo, the Raja Soorsen is very
celebrated and of great renown, whose son Basoodeo Jee is; and in his
house the immortal Vishnù, the god of gods, Shree Krishnù Chund Jee, has
been born, and destroyed the mighty Kuns, and all evil spirits; and,
having removed the burthens of the earth, has shed splendour on the
family of Judoo, and conferred happiness on all the descendants of
Judoo, and other subjects; we shall acquire fame and greatness in the
world by bestowing Rookmunee on such

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

a personage as Shree Krishnù Chund Jee, the lord of Dwarka." At these
words, all the people of the court were highly delighted, and said, "O
great king! you have determined well, and will not meet with such a
bridegroom, and of so good a family any where else. It is, therefore,
most advisable to give Rookmunee in marriage to Shree Krishnù Chund
Jee." When, O great king! all the courtiers had thus spoken, Raja
Bheekmuk's eldest son, Rookum, was exceedingly wroth, and said, "These
stupid, ignorant people speak without thinking, and do not understand
Krishnù's condition; he has lived with Nund sixteen years, and is
universally called a cowherd; he tends herds, and wears a blanket, and
eats his labourer's food, seated on a fig tree: he is a village cowherd,
and has no caste or rank. And how do we know whose son he is. Seeing
that no one knows any thing about his father and mother; some look upon
him as the son of the cowherd, Nund, and others as Basoodeo's son; but
no one has yet found out, to a certainty, whose son Krishnù is; and,
therefore, each person speaks of him as he pleases. O great king! all
people honour and respect us, and know our family; but since when have
the descendants of Judoo become Rajas? What matters it, that lately they
have acquired greatness, the first stain cannot yet begot rid of? He is
called the servant of Oogursen; how can we possibly obtain a great name
in the world by betrothing Rookmunee to him. There is a saying, that it
most fitting to contract marriages, enmities and friendships with
equals. And if we give her to Krishnù, the world will call me a
cowherd's brother-in-law; and my good name and reputation will be
utterly ruined." O great king! Rookum went on to say, "That Raja
Sissoopal of the city of Chunderee was a very mighty and potent prince.
From dread of him the world trembles, and the throne has descended in
his family from time immemorial. Your best plan, therefore, is to give

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rookmunee to him;
and please never mention Krishnù's name again before me."

On hearing these words, the courtiers felt deep regret, and remained
silent through fear; and the Raja Bheekmuk did not say any thing. Upon
this Rookum sent for an astrologer; and having fixed upon a lucky day
and fortunate moment, forwarded the nuptial gifts to the Raja Sissoopal
by the hand of a brahmin, who went with them to the city of Chunderee,
to the court of the Raja Sissoopal. On seeing him, the Raja made a
salutation, and enquired from the brahmin, "Say, O god! whence have you
come, and with what object?" The brahmin gave him his blessing and
explained the reasons of his arrival. Raja Sissoopal was delighted at
hearing them; and having sent for his family priest, received the
nuptial gifts and dismissed the brahmin with many presents. He
afterwards invited Joorasindhoo and other Rajas, who came with their
armies; and he also went forth with his troops to the marriage. The
brahmin, who had taken the marks for the forehead, said on his return to
the Raja Bheekmuk, "O great king! I have given the marks to the Raja
Sissoopal, and he is coming to the marriage in splendid procession:
arrange your plans accordingly."

Raja [Bheekmuk](errata.htm#9.md) was at first very sad, when he heard these
words: afterwards, having reflected and thought upon the matter, he went
into his palace and mentioned the subject to his wife, who immediately
sent for musicians, and invited all her female relations; and gave a
great festive entertainment, with a view of celebrating the marriage in
due form, and with all the prescribed ceremonies. The Raja then came
forth, and ordered his minister and counsellors "To collect together all
things necessary for the marriage;" and they immediately carried the
Raja's order into full effect by procuring every thing. People saw and
heard what was being done: and a report got abroad in the city, that
"Rookmunee was to have been married to Shree

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Krishnù Chund, but
the wicked Rookum would not permit it; and that now she was to be
married to Sissoopal."

Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the
Raja Pureechit,--O lord of the earth! such was the talk in each house in
the city: and in the palace, the women sang and played, and made the
necessary preparations; brahmins read the Vedas, and caused all the
usual customs of marriage to be duly observed: large kettle-drums
resounded in many places; pillars formed of sprouting plaintain were
fixed in the earth, and golden water pots, placed in front of each door;
strings of flowers and garlands were fastened in every direction, and on
one side, the inhabitants of the city apart, swept and spread with
cloths the markets, roads and cross-roads. Whilst there was this bustle
and preparation inside and outside the house, some female friends of
Rookmunee came and said to her, Rookum has given thee to Sissoopal; and
now Rookmunee; you have become a queen." Engaged in thought, and
drooping her head she said, "My affections, words and vows are all
centred in the lord of the world, (Krishnù.)"

Having thus spoken, Rookmunee was much depressed in spirits, and sent
for a brahmin, to whom she explained all her wishes, with joined hands
and with many supplications; and treating him with great consideration,
said, "O great king! take my message to Dwarka, and having mentioned it
to Dwarkanath (Krishnù), bring him here with you, I shall be under the
greatest obligation to you, and shall think that I am indebted to your
kindness in obtaining Shree Krishnù, as my bridegroom." The brahmin
replied, "Tell me what message I am to take, and I will mention it to
Shree Krishnù Chund. He is the lord of compassion: and if he should
compassionately consent to come, I will bring him with me." When the
brahmin had thus spoken, Rookmunee Jee gave into his hands a letter,
written in the most affectionate terms, and said, "Deliver it to Shree
Krishnù Chund, the root of joy, and say to him for me, that his servant,
with joined hands and the

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

greatest supplications, looks upon him, as being acquainted with the
secrets of the heart, and knowing the inmost thoughts of every one. What
more need I say? I have sought his protection: my character is in his
hands, let him act in such away, that it may be preserved, and come
quickly and see me."

When Rookmunee Jee, O great king! dismissed the brahmin with these
words, he meditated upon Krishnù, and repeating his name started for
Dwarka; and through his love for Huri, arrived immediately. On arrival,
he beheld the city in the midst of the sea, surrounded on all sides by
extensive forests and hills, and beautiful groves; in which were heard
the cries of animals, and notes of birds of all kinds. There were
elegant tanks, filled with pure water; in which the lotus was in full
bloom, and bees buzzed in swarms around: on the bank, geese and cranes
and other birds were disporting; gardens of fruits and flowers of every
kind extended for many toss, on the borders of which betel plantations
flourished. Gardeners were standing at the wells, singing sweet
melodies; and, plying the water-wheels and buckets, poured forth water
in every direction; and the quays were thronged with female
water-carriers. As the brahmin progressed, after having viewed this
beautiful scene with delight, he saw very lofty castles on all sides of
the city, having four gates, and doors studded with jewels, and inlaid
with gold. Inside the city were five and seven-storied houses of gold
and jewels, glittering with great splendour, and reaching to the sky:
the spires of which were as resplendent as lightning. Flags and banners
of various colours were waving: perfumed odours came forth from the
doors, blinds, air-holes and trellis-work: at each door were pillars of
plantain sprouts, and golden water-pots, filled with water: wreaths of
flowers and garlands were fastened in every direction; and there were
sounds of musical rejoicing in every house. In many places the Pooranùs
were recited, and people discoursed of Huri. The eighteen different
classes lived happily and at ease, the quoit Soodursun protecting the
city.

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja!
viewing this beautiful and elegant city, the brahmin arrived at the
court of the Raja Oogursen; and, giving him his blessing enquired,
"Where does Shree Krishnù Chund Jee dwell?" Some one pointed out his
house; and when he arrived, and stood before the gate, the watchmen made
a salutation on seeing him, and enquired, "Say, whence do you come, and
from what country have you brought a letter?" He replied, "I am a
brahmin, and an inhabitant of Koondulpore, and have come to deliver a
letter to Shree Krishnù Chund from Rookmunee, the daughter of Raja
Bheekmuk." The door-keepers answered, "Be pleased to go into the house,
Shree Krishnú Chund is sitting opposite on a throne." At these words,
when the brahmin entered, Huri, on seeing him, immediately descended
from his throne, and making a salutation, received him with the greatest
respect and dignity.

Having seated him on his throne, and washed his feet, he took the water
with which his feet had been washed, and waited upon him with the same
assiduity, that a person would observe in attending upon a deity.

At length Krishnù, having rubbed him with perfumed paste, and having
finished his ablutions, placed before him all kinds of delicacies; and
afterwards presented him with pawn, and sprinkling him with saffron and
sandal, placing a garland of flowers on his neck, took him to a chamber,
ornamented with precious gems, and placed him on a bed with curtains,
and studded with jewels.

O great king! he was weary and fatigued with his journey, and soon fell
into a most pleasant sleep. Shree Krishnù sat for a long time near him
from an anxious desire to hear what he had to communicate to him; and
kept constantly saying to himself, "That the brahmin would wake soon."
When, at length, he found that he would not rise, he became uneasy; and
sitting at the foot of his bed, began to rub his feet. The brahmin was
awakened by this, and sat up. Then Huri made

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

kind enquiries, and said, "Your government, country and person are
auspicious, explain to me your circumstances, for what purpose have you
come here, and conferred happiness on me by your arrival?" The brahmin
replied, "O abode of mercy! be pleased to listen with attention, and I
will explain the reasons of my coming: Since, O great king! the daughter
of Bheekmuk, Raja of Koondulpore, heard of your great name, and your
many excellent qualities, she has her thoughts fixed on you constantly,
night and day, and desires to attend upon your lotus-like feet. A chance
offered of her doing so, but it was rendered unsuccessful." Krishnù
enquired, "What the chance was?" The brahmin said, "O kind to the poor!
one day the Raja Bheekmuk having assembled all his courtiers and
relations, said to them, 'Brothers! my daughter is of an age to be
married; we must now fix upon a husband for her.' When the Raja had thus
spoken, they mentioned the families, virtues, renown and power of a
great many Rajas, of whom, however, he did not approve. Upon this,
Rookumkesh mentioned your name, at which the Raja was delighted, and
acquiesced in what he proposed, and said to them all, 'Brothers!' his
words are engraved in my mind, as though they had been engraved on
stone, what is your opinion?' They replied, 'If, O great king! you were
to search the aggregate of the three worlds, you would not meet with
such a bridegroom, and such a family as his: for which reason, you
should, without any delay, quickly give Rookmunee in marriage to Shree
Krishnù Jee.' O great king! this had been resolved upon, when Rookum
prevented its being carried into effect, and betrothed Rookmunee to
Sissoopal; and he has gone forth to the marriage, taking all his army of
evil spirits with him."

Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O
lord of the earth! the brahmin, having thus informed Huri, delivered
Rookmunee Jee's letter to him, who

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

received it with the utmost affection, and placed it in his breast; and
after reading it said with delight to the brahmin, O divinity! suffer
not any anxiety; I will accompany you, and, having slain the evil
spirits, will fulfil Rookmunee's wishes."

The brahmin was restored to confidence by these words; but Huri was
occupied with anxious thoughts of Rookmunee.
