### CHAPTER XII.

SHREE SHOOKDEO, the sage, said,--Raja! when those two trees fell,
hearing the sound, and being alarmed, the wife of Nund came to the spot
where Krishnù had been tied to the wooden mortar; and all the
cowherdesses and cowherds came also after her. When she did not find
Krishnù there, being agitated in mind, Jusodha went about calling out,
and repeating the name of Mohun--"Where has he gone, that was tied down?
Has any one seen my boy Kunhya any where?" In the meantime, (or at this
time,) a woman of Bruj, having come before Jusodha, said, "Two trees
have fallen down, and there Krishnù has escaped."

Having heard this, they all advanced and saw that two trees had indeed
fallen down, uprooted, and Krishnù was sitting between them, tied to the
wooden mortar, and contracted in size. Going up to him, Nund's wife,
loosing him from the wooden mortar, and weeping, clasped Krishnù to her
bosom; and all the cowherdesses, supposing that he was alarmed, began to
snap their fingers, and clap their hands to make Krishnù laugh. Upon
this, Nund and Oopnund began to say to each other, "How have these
trees, which have been growing up for ages, fallen down, uprooted; this
strange occurrence cannot be understood, nor is the secret of it
comprehensible."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Having heard this,
a young boy explained the circumstances of the trees falling, exactly as
they had occured; but no one could understand them. One said, "How can
these children understand such a secret as this?" Another said, "Perhaps
it may be so, for who can comprehend the state of Huri?" Thus making
remarks of various kinds, and taking Shree Krishnù with them, they all
came with delight to Gokool: then Nund Jee gave many presents, and
performed many charitable acts. After the lapse of some days, Krishnù's
birth-day came round: Jusodha sent an invitation to all their relations;
and having given an entertainment, tied the anniversary birth-day knot.
When they all sat down to eat, Nund Rae said, "Brethren! how can we
possibly remain in Gokool? Every day, many acts of injustice are
committed; let us go somewhere, where we can have grass and
water"--Oopnund said, "If you go and live at Brindabun, you will live
there with delight." Having heard this speech, Nund Jee entertaining
them all, and giving them seats after distributing pawn, sent for an
astrologer, and enquired the proper division of time of (48) forty-eight
minutes for the journey. He, considering, said, "To-morrow is a very
good day for a journey in that direction; the spirits, attendant on good
and bad luck, are on the left; the unlucky quarter is behind us, and the
moon before us: you may start off early in the morning without any
anxiety." Having heard this, all the cowherdesses and cowherds went to
their homes, but early in the morning they all assembled together,
having packed up all their goods and chattels on carts. Nund Jee also
accompanied them, with all his relations; and proceeding on their
journey, and crossing the river, they arrived in the evening. Having
propitiated the goddess Toolsee, they occupied Brindabun; and all began
to live there with ease and pleasure.

When Shree Krishnù was five years old, he said to his mother, "I will go
out to graze the calves; tell Buldao not

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

to leave me alone in the jungle." She replied, "Son! there are many
servants of yours, whose business it is to take the calves out to graze;
do not you go, who are the protection of my eye-lids, and dearer to me
than my eyes." Krishnù said, "If I am allowed to go into the jungle to
amuse myself, I will eat my food; if not, I will not." On hearing this,
Jusodha having called the cowherds' children, and entrusted Krishnù and
Bulram to them, said, "Do not go far to graze the calves, and bring them
both home together before evening. Do not leave them by themselves in
the jungle; remain with them; you are their guardians." Saying this, and
giving them food, she made over Ram and Krishnù to them. They having
gone to the banks of the Jumna, began to graze the calves and to play
with the cowherds' children. At this time, Buchasoor, who had been sent
by Kuns, came there under a disguised form: on seeing him, the
frightened calves ran off in all directions. Upon this, Shree Krishnù
remarked to Buldeo with a wink, "Brother! this is some demon that has
come here." Afterwards, when in the act of feeding he approached near to
accomplish his treacherous design (lit: to arrange his ambuscade,) Shree
Krishnù having seized him by the hind leg, and twisted him round his
head, dashed him down with such violence, that life left his body.
Having heard of the death of Buchasoor, Kuns sent Bukasoor, who having
come to Brindabun, and arranged his snare, went and sat on the bank of
the Jumna, in the appearance of a hill--On beholding him, the cowherds
began, through fear, to say to Krishnù, "Brother! this is some demon,
who has come in the form of a crane; how shall we escape from him?" On
the one hand, the cowherds were speaking thus to Krishnù; on the other,
the demon was revolving in his mind, "That he would certainly destroy
Krishnù on that day." In the meantime, when Shree Krishnù went near him,
he raised him up with his bill, and shut his mouth. The cowherds'
children being perplexed, looking round on all sides and crying, began
to call out, and say, "Alas! alas!

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Huldhur too is not
here, what shall we go and tell Jusodha?" Seeing that they were greatly
distressed, Shree Krishnù became so hot, that the crane could not retain
him in his mouth. When the crane vomited him out, Krishnù having seized
his beak, and pressed it under his feet, tore it in pieces; and
collecting the calves, he returned home with his companions, laughing
and playing.
