### CHAPTER LXXVI.

RAJA PUREECHIT said,--"O great king! explain to me the reason, why all
were delighted with the royal sacrifice, and Doorjodhun alone
dissatisfied, that the perplexities of my mind may be removed." Shree
Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja! your paternal grandfather was a man of great
wisdom, and apportioned the business of the sacrifice to each, according
to his observation of the character of each. He made Bheem
superintendent of the victualling department; he appointed Suhdeo to
look after the religious ceremonies; Nukool's office was to bring money;
Urjoon was appointed to be in constant attendance; Shree Krishnù Chund
Jee took the duties of washing feet and clearing away what food was
left, and the treachers, formed of leaves; to Doorjodhun, the Raja
assigned the business of distributing money; and every one of the Rajas
received each some separate work. O great king! all did their work
fairly, with exception of Raja Doorjodhun, who practised the deceit of
distributing many times in place of only distributing once; thinking,
and having determined in his mind, to break their bank, and thereby
destroy their respectability. But by the favour of Bhugwan, their
respectability was not destroyed; on the contrary, their character was
enchanted, and therefore he was displeased, and he did not know that
there

were lines in his hand, so that if he gave one rupee, four would be
collected.

Having recited thus much of the narrative, Shree Shookdeo Jee
said,--Raja! be pleased now to listen to what follows in the narrative.
On the departure of Shree Krishnù Chund Jee, Raja Joodisthur, having
entertained the Rajas, bestowed dresses of honour upon them, and behaved
to them with the utmost complaisance, allowed them to take leave; and
they arranged their several armies, and set out for their own countries.
After this, Raja Joodisthur, taking the Panduvùs and Kouruvùs with him,
went, in musical procession, to bathe in the Ganges. Having arrived on
the banks of the river, he made an obeisance; and, having rubbed dust on
his body and sipping water in his hands, he entered the stream with his
wife; all the party bathed at the same time with them. Then, when they
had bathed and washed, and finished their meditations and prayers, and
adoration, and had put on their clothes and ornaments; Raja Joodisthur,
accompanied by them all, came to where the demon Mye had built a most
elegant house of gold, studded with jewels. O great king! having gone
there, Raja Joodisthur sat upon a throne; at that time, celestial
musicians sang of his good qualities; bards and panegyrists recited his
celebrated deeds; in the midst of the assembly, dancing girls danced;
inside and outside the house, musicians and singers played and sang
songs of festivity and rejoicing; and the court of the Raja Joodisthur
appeared like the court of Indrù. In the mean while, when the Raja
Doorjodhun heard of the Raja Joodisthur's arrival, he pretended
friendship, and went there with great pomp and parade to meet him.

Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the
Raja Pureechit,--O great king! the demon Mye had contrived in the midst
of a square enclosure, that whoever entered it, should mistake dry land
for water, and water for dry land. O great king! when the Raja
Doorjodhun entered the enclosure, on seeing dry land, he thought that it
was

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

water, and pulled off all his clothes; having then gone a little further
and seeing water, he mistook it for dry land; and, as he advanced, his
clothes wetted. On observing this mistake of his, all the courtiers
burst out laughing, and Raja Joodisthur turned his head aside to prevent
himself from laughing. O great king! having heard them all laughing,
Raja Doorjodhun was very much ashamed and went away in great wrath.
Having sat down in the court, he began to say, "Since Joodisthur has
obtained the support of Krishnù's strength, he has become very proud.
To-day, while he was sitting in the court, he made all the courtiers
laugh at me; I will revenge myself on him for this, and chastise his
pride, otherwise my name is not Doorjodhun."
