### CHAPTER LXVI.

SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! on one occasion, Shree Krishnù
Chund, the root of joy, and Bulram, the abode of happiness, were sitting
in a jewelled house, when Buldeo Jee said to Krishnù, "Brother! when
Kuns sent to invite us from Brindabun, and we went off to Muttra, then
you and I promised the cowherdesses, and Nund and Jusodha, that we would
return quickly, we have not gone there, but taken up our abode at
Dwarka; they will be thinking of us. With your permission I will go and
see the place of our birth, and will offer them consolation." Krishnù
gave his consent; and upon this, Bulram took leave of them all, carrying
a ploughshare and pestle; and mounting his chariot, started off.

O great king! the Rajas of all the cities, towns and villages, Bulram
Jee passed through, came out to welcome him, and escorted him with the
greatest politeness; and he offered consolation to each of them. After
some days' journey, Bulram Jee arrived at the city of Awuntika; he paid
his respects to the spiritual preceptor, who had instructed him in
knowledge, and stayed about ten days with him. On taking leave of his
preceptor, Buldeo Jee went on to Gokool, and beheld the cows every where
in the jungle with their

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

mouths open, not having eaten any grass, thinking of Shree Krishnù
Chund, their minds wrapt up in the tones of his lute, wandering about
lowing and panting; and behind them the  cowherds' children singing
Huri's praises, and imbued with affection for him, were going along; and
on all sides the inhabitants of the city were commending Krishnù's
exploits and sports. Seeing this condition of the inhabitants and of the
cows, on arrival at his birth-place, Bulram took compassion upon them,
and his eyes filled with tears; all the cowherds'
[children](errata.htm#18.md) came running out, when they saw the flag and
banner on the chariot, supposing that Shree Krishnù Chund and Bulram had
come. Bulram descended from his ruth at their approach, and embraced and
began to make the kindest enquiries from each of them; in the mean
while, some one told Nund and Jusodha, "That Buldeo had arrived." On
hearing the news, Nund and Jusodha, and the cowherds rose and rushed
out. Bulram, when he saw them from a distance coming towards him, ran
and threw himself at the feet of Nund Rae; then Nund Jee shedding tears
of joy, raised Bulram, and embraced him with the utmost affection, and
forgot all the pains of separation; Bulram then went and laid hold of
Jusodha's feet, who fondly clasped him to her bosom, she embraced and
clung 'to his neck, tears streaming from her eyes.

Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the
Raja,--O great king! after this interview, Nund Rae Jee took Bulram into
the house, and began to make kind enquiries, asking "If Oogursen and
Basoodeo, and the Judoos, and Shree Krishnù Chund, the root of joy, were
all well. Do they ever think of us?" Bulram said, "Through your favour,
they are all well and happy, and constantly sing of your good
qualities." Nund Rae was silent when he heard this; then the Ranee
Jusodha, tears filling her eyes as she thought of Krishnù, said with
great emotion, "Buldeo Jee! is Shree Krishnù, the star of my eyes,
well?" Bulram

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

replied, "That he was quite well." Jusodha then began to say, "Buldeo!
since Huri went hence, there has been a darkness before my eyes; and I
think of him constantly, day and night, (during the eight puhurs)--and
he has entirely forgotten me, and gone and taken up his abode at Dwarka;
and behold, my sisters, Dewukee and Rohnee, have also relinquished all
affection for me, consider Gokool as near Muttra; you have thought
hitherto that we lived at a distance, Huri would come to see us and pay
us visit; but they, (that is, Rohnee and Dewukee) have arranged that he
shall not have another interview with us."

O great king! when having thus spoken, Jusodha was in a state of the
greatest agitation, and began to weep, Bulram Jee entered into
explanations with her, and made her understand how matters really stood;
and inspired her with confidence; afterwards when he had taken
refreshment, and eaten pawn, and came out of the house, he saw that all
the women of Bruj were emaciated and desponding with dishevelled hair, a
dirty appearance, depressed in spirits, neglecting their domestic
affairs, deeply in love, in the highest excitement of youthful desire,
singing the good qualities of Huri, restless at his absence, and going
about in every direction like drunken persons.

O great king! on seeing Bulram, they came running to him with the
greatest delight; and making obeisance, surrounded him on all sides; and
with joined hands, began to question him, and say, "Tell us, O Bulram!
the abode of happiness, where does our soul, the lovely Krishnù, now
dwell? Does Beharee ever think of us, or has he forgotten all his former
love, since he obtained a throne? Since he went hence, he has once sent
us a message through Oodho to perform penance; and has taken no further
thought of any one; "and as he has now gone to take up his abode in the
sea, why should he make enquiries about any of us?" On hearing these
words, one of the cowherdesses said, "Friend! who would regret the love
of Huri, after seeing the manner he

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

has treated us all? He is not beloved by any one, he who has turned his
back upon his father and mother; he does not remain an hour without
Radha, and it is she, who has made him stay away; again what have you
and I gained by leaving our homes, sacrificing all respect for our
families, and for the world, abandoning our sons and husbands, and
fixing our affections upon Huri; having embarked us on the boat of love,
he has altogether left us in the midst of the sea of separation; and we
hear, that Krishnù has now gone to Dwarka, and contracted many
marriages; and that he has also married sixteen thousand one hundred and
eight Rajas' daughters, whom Bhomasoor had kept confined. They have had
sons and grandsons, why should he leave them and come here?" Another
cowherdess said, "Friend! do not regret in any way on account of the
reports about Huri, because Oodho Jee came and mentioned all his good
qualities." She again said, "Friends! act now according to my
suggestion--let us, having been allowed to touch the feet of Bulram,
continue to sing in praise of his good qualities. He is fair, and not of
black-coloured body, he will not practise deceit." Bulram said in reply,
"I have made this journey for your sakes. I have come here to tell you;
and for this purpose Krishnù sent me to Bruj; I will stay two months
with you, and dance the circular dance, and fulfil all your,
expectations."

O great king! Bulram Jee, having thus spoken, gave a command to the
women of Bruj, "As this is the night of the full moon of Chuetrù, adorn
yourselves, and go into the forest; and I will engage in festive songs
and dance with you." Having thus said, Bulram Jee went in the evening to
the forest, and all the women of Bruj followed him, wearing elegant
dresses, and ornaments? and adorned from head to foot, came to Buldeo,
they all remained bending their heads. The beauty of Buldeo cannot be
described; of the colour of gold, he was dressed in a blue dress; his
moon

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

like countenance and lotus eyes captivated all hearts; a ear-ring shone
with lustrous beauty in one of his ears; as though the sun and moon
dwelt together; the other ear had drank of the flavour of the celebrity
of Huri; and he  did not fasten an ear-ring in it. Jewels in profusion
were fastened on all parts of his body, the splendour of which baffles
description. The women fell at his feet, saying, "Engage in sports and
delightful festive songs and dances with us."

O great king! on hearing this request, Bulram Jee made the mystical
sound of "*hoon*," on uttering which, all the materials, necessary for
the festival were immediately produced. The cowherdesses then abandoning
all care and modesty, giving themselves up to the passion of love, began
to sing and play upon lutes, drums, cymbals, pipes and other musical
instruments of all kinds, and gratify Bulram by their merrymaking and
dancing, and blandishments.

On hearing them play and sing, and seeing them dance, Buldeo Jee was
delighted; and, having drank some spirituous liquor, began to sing and
dance, and engage in every kind of sport, and enjoy mutual pleasure; at
that time the gods, celestial musicians and choristers, and the
demi-gods, accompanied by their wives, and sitting in chariots, singing
the praises of Bulram, rained flowers from the sky. The moon and the
assembly of the stars, beholding the happiness of the festive assembly,
poured down nectar from their rays, the air became still, and the course
of water was stopped.

Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O
great king! in this manner Bulram Jee engaged at night in festive songs
and dances with the women of Bruj, during the months of Chuetrù and
Bysakh, and in the day-time made Nund and Jusodha happy by relating the
history of Huri. One night, whilst engaging in festivities, Bulram Jee
having gone and reposed on the banks of the river, said angrily, "Jumna!
flow thou here, and forming a thousand streams,

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

bathe me with thy waters; if thou obeyest not my command, thy waters
shall be divided into several portions." When, O great king, the Jumna
through pride would not attend to what Bulram Jee said, he drew her
towards him with his plough and bathed, and from that day the Jumna has
been bent at that spot. Having bathed and got rid of all his fatigue,
Bulram Jee made all the cowherdesses happy; and, taking them with him,
went from the forest to the city; there the cowherdesses said, "O lord
of the Judoos, take us hence with you."

Having heard this request, Bulram Jee encouraged the hopes of the
cowherdesses; and, having inspired them with confidence, allowed them to
take leave, and went himself to take leave of Nund and Jusodha. He then
explained to them and gave them comfort also; and after a stay of some
days took leave, and set off for Dwarka, where he soon arrived.
