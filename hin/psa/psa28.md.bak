### CHAPTER XXVII.

SHREE SHOOKDEO said, when Huri had let the hill down from his hand, and
restored it to its former place, all the older cowherds, on beholding
this miraculous work, said amongst themselves, "How can we call him the
son of Nund, whose power has this day saved the country all round Bruj
from this great deluge? Truly, Nund and Jusodha must at some time have
performed a great penance, for which reason (or in consequence of which)
Bhugwan has been born in their house." And the cowherds' children having
come and embraced Krishnù, asked him, "Brother! how did you support the
weight of such a huge hill on your soft lotus-like hand?"

And Nund and Jusodha, clasping their son with tenderness to their
bosoms, rubbing his hand, and making his finger crack, began to say to
him, "You placed the hill for seven days on your hand; it must now be
painful."

And the cowherdesses came to Jusodha, and having mentioned to her all
the sports which Krishnù had last been engaged in, said, "May this
child, your son, live a very long time, the guardian of Bruj. He has
destroyed demons, giants and evil spirits. Where are the limits to his
liberation of the inhabitants of Bruj. Every thing has happened, exactly
as Rae Gurug, the sage, said.'
