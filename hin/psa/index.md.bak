The Prem Sagar was one of the first books published in modern Hindi,
written in the Delhi dialect which was eventually adopted as one of the
official national languages of India. It is the tale of the deeds of
Krishna, the invincible avatar of Vishnu. Based on the tenth book of the
Bhagavata Purana, the Prem Sagar, which means 'Ocean of Love,' (one of
Krishna's epithets) was composed by Lallu Lal between 1804 and 1810.
Lallu Lal's retelling of this traditional cycle of legends of Krishna is
distinguished by naturalistic dialog and frank sensuality. The narrative
overlaps with the Krishna section of the [Vishnu Purana](../vp/index.md)
(also at this site). While the Prem Sagar is not considered part of
Hindu scripture *per se*, it is popular because it makes this portion of
the Purana narrative accessible to Hindi speakers who don't know
Sanskrit.

Krishna is a complex character. His story is a huge mares' nest of
archetypes and folklore motifs. He is spirited away to the countryside
because of a prophecy of regicide, evading a massacre of innocents. In
his youth he is the pastoral trickster, whose stunts eventually arouse
the ire of the gods themselves. Part Coyote, Heracles, and Dionysus, the
adolescent Krishna becomes the beloved of all of the women of the
village, (chastely) consorting with all of them in turn. He battles
monsters and demons in epic battles. As his destiny unfolds, he is lured
into the city, where he overcomes the evil king in single combat, taking
his place. As a ruler, Krishna is a mighty warrior with a plethora of
gorgeous wives. However, he remains a man of the people. The royals
constantly harp on his cow-herding origins. The mature Krishna showers
spiritual and material rewards on his friends regardless of their place
in the social hierarchy.

We don't know of any English translations of the Prem Sagur currently in
print. There were at least two during the 19th century. This was the
only one we were able to obtain. Hollings, who was apparently a British
officer, translated the Prem Sagar into clear, modern English, and
produced a lively, very readable version. The only minor hurdle for
contemporary readers may be his use of *ù*, *u*, and occasionally *ú* to
transcribe short *a*. Thus we get *Krishnù* for Krishna, *Brahmù* for
Brahma, etc. He also uses *ee* for long *i* and *oo* for long *u*. In
addition, he emulated Hindi's tendency to drop final vowels, which makes
some of the names difficult to associate with the Sanskrit equivalent.
However, as is the practice at this site, we have reproduced the
original system of transcription as closely as possible.
