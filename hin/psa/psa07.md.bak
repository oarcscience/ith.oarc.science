### CHAPTER VI.

HAVING narrated so much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--Raja!
once on a time, Nund and Jusodha performed a great religious penance for
a son; when Shree Narayun himself gave a promise, that he would be born
in their house. When Shree Krishnù came at midnight on a Wednesday, the
eighth of the dark part of the month Bhadon, Jusodha being awake at the
time, and having beheld her son's face, sending for Nund, was highly
delighted, and thought that she had gained every object of her life.
Early in the morning, Nund Jee having got up sent for pundits and
astrologers, who came with their books and almanacks, and Nund offered
them seats with great respect, and honour. They, according to the
precepts of the Shastrùs, having fixed upon the year, month, lunar-day,
solar-day, division of the zodiack, the lucky moment, and exact, ray of
light, and having considered the rising of a sign of the zodiack, and
having settled a division of time equal to (48) forty-eight minutes,
said,--"O great king! after consulting our Shastrùs we are of opinion,
that the child about to be born will be a second deity, as Bruhmù;
having destroyed all evil spirits, and relieved the burthens of Bruj, he
shall be called the lord of cowherdesses, and the whole world shall sing
his praises." On hearing this, Nund Jee

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

made a vow to offer up two hundred thousand, (200,000) cows, with horns
of gold, hoofs of silver, backs of copper, and arrayed in yellow silk
robes; and having given all sorts of gifts and presents to Brahmins,
ands receiving their blessing, he dismissed them--After this, he sent
for all the musicians and singers of the city: they came, and began to
display their accomplishments; the musicians to play, the dancers to
dance, singers to sing, and the bards to celebrate praises. And all the
cowherds of Gokool made their wives bring vessels, containing sour milk,
on their heads. Assuming various disguises, dancing and singing, they
came to offer congratulatory presents to Nund. On their arrival, they
threw about, and at each other, so much coagulated milk and clay, that
the whole of Gokool seemed to be covered with coagulated milk--When they
had finished this sport, Nund having entertained them all, presented
them with dresses, made the marks of "*tiluk*" on their foreheads, and
given them pawn, (betle leaf,) dismissed them.

The congratulations lasted in this manner for some days:--during this
time, every one obtained whatever he asked from Nund Jee. Being free
from the congratulations, Nund Jee sent for all the cowherds, and said
to them, "Brothers! I have heard that Kuns is laying hold of all the
little children "he can find; there is no knowing but some wicked person
may say something against us; for which reason it is proper that we
should in a body take presents, and offer annual tribute." They all
agreed to this, and taking with them from their houses, milk, curds,
butter and money, loading them on carts, they came from Gokool to
Muttra, accompanied by Nund. Having had an interview with Kuns, they
offered presents, and having paid their tribute, being permitted to
depart, making their salutations, they returned homewards.

When they reached the bank of the Jumna, Basoodeo Jee having received
information of their coming, went there also: embracing Nund, and making
enquiries regarding his affairs, he began to say, "I have not such a
relative and friend

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

as you in the whole world, because when a great calamity happened to me,
I sent Rohnee, then with child, to you. She has had a son, whom you have
nurtured with great care-"How can I sufficiently describe your virtues?"
Saying this, he asked him, "Tell me, are Ram Krishnù, and your wife
Jusodha well?" Nund Jee replied, "By your kindness all are well, and the
root of my life, your Buldeo Jee is also well. In consequence of his
being born, by reason of your virtue and majesty, I also have had a son:
but there is one of your griefs, which much afflicts me." Busoodeo said,
"Friend! we have no power over the deity, the lines of fate cannot he
effaced by one. For this reason, after coming into the world, who should
regret, if he suffers pain and affliction." Having thus informed him, he
said, "Go quickly to your home, Kuns has committed many acts of
violence; the vile wretch is making search for, and having brought to
him all the infant children he can: good subjects have been put to
death, you have all come here, and evil spirits are on the search, and
prowling about: who knows but that some wicked person may go to Gokool,
and cause injustice to be done." On hearing this, Nund Jee being
agitated, and taking all with him, engaged in thought, went from Muttra
to Gokool.
