### CHAPTER XXIV.

SHRED SHOOKDEO JEE said, when Shree Krishnù, having arrived near the
Jumna, was standing under a tree, leaning on a club, all the cowherds'
children and their companions came, and joining their hands said,--"O
great king! we are very hungry; we have eaten all the food we brought
with us, still our hunger has not gone off." Krishnù replied, "Observe
that smoke, which appears some distance off. The inhabitants of Muttra
are offering sacrifice secretly from fear of Kuns: go to them, and
having mentioned my name, and made an obeisance, stand before them with
hands joined; and from a distance ask for food with the same humility,
as meek beggars ask for it."

The cowherds, after hearing this speech, went to the spot where the
inhabitants of Muttra were sacrificing, (were seated preparing the
sacrifice.) Having gone, and paid their respects, they said with the
greatest humility, joining their hands,--"O great kings! Shree Krishnù
Chund Jee has, with deferential respect, sent this message to you
through us, he is very hungry, and would be much obliged if you would
kindly send him something to eat." When the inhabitants of Muttra had
heard this message from the cowherds, they replied angrily, "You must be
very hungry to make such a request at this time; we will not give any
one any thing until the

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

sacrifice is completed, when we have made the offering; if any thing
remains, we will distribute it." The cowherds, imploring them again
earnestly, said with importunity,--"O great kings! it is an act of great
virtue to give food to a hungry man, who comes to your house." They
listened not to what the cowherds urged; but turning away from them,
said to each other--"These are very foolish, low cowherds, who beg for
food in the middle of a sacrifice." The cowherds, returning thence
displeased and with great regret, came and said to Krishnù,--"O great
king! we have forfeited our dignity and character by begging, and have
not obtained any thing to eat: what shall we do now?" Shree Krishnù Jee
said, "Go and ask their wives: they are very kind and virtuous. Observe
their affection: on seeing you, they will give you food with the utmost
respect and deference." Having heard this, the cowherds went to the
place, where the wives were cooking, and [said to them](errata.htm#2.md),
"Shree Krishnù has become hungry, while pasturing cows in the jungle,
and has sent us to you--if you have any thing to eat, give it us." They
were delighted on hearing these words from the cowherds, and ran off and
brought gold dishes, filled with food of all sorts and flavours--and
would not admit any one hindering or preventing them.

A woman of Muttra, whose husband would not allow her to go, having
meditated and quitted her body, arrived before them all, and joined
Krishnù's party, in the same way that water mixes (or unites) with
water. And after her the rest of the. women came to the place where
Krishnù was standing with the cowherds' children under the shade of a
tree, with his hand on a companion's shoulder, his figure bent, and a
lotus in his hand. On approaching him they placed the dishes before him,
and having made an obeisance, they said to each other, on beholding the
countenance of Huri, "Friend! this is Nund's son; let us completely
gratify our eyes by looking at the moonlike face of him, on whom we
meditated upon hearing his

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

name; and let us receive the fruit, (that is,) the darling object of our
lives." Conversing thus, and joining their hands together, they began to
say in a tone of solicitation to Krishnù, "O lord of compassion! except
through your mercy, who can obtain a sight of you. Great is our good
fortune to-day, that we have seen you, and got rid of all our sins in
every birth!

"The foolish, avaricious proud priests, whose minds have been stained by
the spirit, avarice and fascination of wealth, regarded God as man. How
shall men, blinded by delusion, recognize the difference? Why should
they not give food to him, to whom they offer up prayers, penance,
sacrifice and love?

"O great king! that wealth, those mortals, and that modesty are
advantageous, which may be useful to you; and likewise the penance,
prayers and knowledge, by which your name is celebrated." After hearing
this, Shree Krishnù Chund, having made enquiries about their welfare and
condition, said, "Do not make obeisance to me, I am merely the child of
the chief Nund. Do they who cause themselves to be worshipped by
Brahmins' wives, obtain greatness in the world? knowing me to be hungry,
you took compassion, and thought of me in the jungle. How shall I now
entertain you? Brindabun, my home, is far off; how shall I be able to
treat you with proper dignity and respect? If I were there, I would
bring flowers and fruits, and place them before you. You have suffered
inconvenience on my account by coming into the jungle; and I regret,
that I have not been able to serve you in any way." He said again in the
same complaisant manner, "It is a long time since you came here: be
pleased now to go home, as the Brahmins, your husbands, will be
expecting you; because the sacrifice is not propitious without the
presence of the wife." Having heard this speech of Krishnù's, they said,
joining their hands, "O great king! we fixing our affections on your
lotus-like

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

feet, have abandoned all feelings of consideration for our families and
relatives. How can we return to those, in disobedience to whose
injunctions we came here? If they will not admit us into their houses,
where shall we live; for which reason it is better that we should remain
under your protection. And lord, one of our women, from a wish to see
you, was coming here, her husband stopped her, and the wife being
distracted resigned her life." When Krishnù heard this, he laughed, and
showed them the woman who had quitted her body, and said, "They who show
love for Huri are never destroyed. She came here before you all." Having
narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! on seeing
her, they were all astonished. Afterwards, when they recovered their
understanding, they began to sing the virtues of Huri. In the meantime
Krishnù having eaten the food they gave him, said to them, "Return home
now, your husbands will not say any thing." When Shree Krishnù had thus
explained to them, having made their salutations they took their
departure and went home. And their husbands, engaged in thought and
expressing great regret, continued saying, "We have heard a story in the
Pooranùs, that at one time Nund and Jusodha performed great penance for
a son; and Bhugwan came and gave them a promise, that he would descend
upon the earth in the family of Judoo, and go to their house. He has
been born, and it was he, who sent to procure food through the cowherds'
children. What have we done in refusing food to Krishnù, when he asked
it? To-day we have not gone into the presence of him, for whose sake
sacrifice and religion have been established. We regarded Krishnù as a
mortal, and did not listen to what the cowherds said. Accursed are our
minds, and the performance of this sacrifice, that we did not recognize
Bhugwan, and worship him. Our wives are superior to us, who went in such
a spirited manner to behold Krishnù, and gave him food with their own
hands, without having

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

offered prayers, penance or sacrifice." Thus expressing their regret,
the inhabitants of Muttra said in presence of their wives, joining their
hands, "Great is your good fortune in having seen Huri, your lives have
been most propitious."
