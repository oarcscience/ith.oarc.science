### CHAPTER XXXVII.

SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! one day Shree Krishnù and
Bulram, having given pasture to the cows, were returning home in the
evening from the jungle, when a demon, in the form of a huge bull, came
amongst the cows. His body reached to the sky; his hard back was like a
stone, his two sharp horns were standing erect: and blood-red eyes
filled with rage. Raising his tail, he wandered about bellowing,
sometimes he stopt, and then roamed about again, letting fall dung. He
made his shoulders writhe, and ears shake. All the gods left their
chariots, and ran off. With his hoof he dug up the bank of the river,
and upset a hill with his back, and cast it on the ground. All were in
consternation at that time; the supporters of the world, and the
guardian deities of the ten quarters trembled. The earth quaked: the
king of the serpent race, on whose head the world is supported,
trembled. Cows dropped their calves, and women miscarried. On seeing the
bull, the cows dispersed in every direction; and the inhabitants of Bruj
ran off to where Krishnù and Bulram were coming up behind them. Making
obeisance they said, "O great king! a little distance in front, there is
an immense bull, standing in the road: save us from it."

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

On hearing this, Shree Krishnù Chund, acquainted with the secrets of the
heart, said, "Do not be afraid of it. It has come upon the earth in the
form of a bull, because it desires its destruction from me." On saying
these words, he went forward, and on seeing the bull, Krishnù exclaimed,
"Come to me; you, who have assumed a treacherous form? Why do you
frighten any one else, why not come near me? The so-called lion's enemy
runs not after deer. Behold! I am Gobind, in the form of death, and have
utterly destroyed many like you."

He again called out, striking the upper parts of his arms in preparation
for battle, "Come and fight with me." On hearing these words, the
enraged demon rushed forth with such impetuous violence, that it seemed
as if a thunderbolt of Indrù's were hurled upon the earth. As often as
Krishnù drove him back, he recovered himself, and rushed on again. At
one time, when Krishnù had dashed him upon the earth, he rose up in
great fury, and pinned Huri between his two horns. Then Shree Krishnù
Jee, escaping with activity, and placing his foot on one of the legs of
the bull, laid hold of his horn, and twisted it in the same way, that a
person would wring wet clothes. At length, the bull fell down, and its
life ebbed out.

At this time, the gods seated in their chariots, were so rejoiced, that
they began to rain down flowers; and the [cowherdesses](errata.htm#3.md)
and cowherds, to celebrate with songs the great renown of Krishnù. In
the mean while Shree Radhika Jee came and said to Huri, "O great king!
you have committed a crime in having killed any being in the form of a
bull. For this reason go and bathe in some place of holy pilgrimage,
then you may touch other persons." [Krishnù](errata.htm#4.md) replied, "I
will summon all the places of pilgrimage to Bruj." Having thus said, he
went near the hill Goberdhun, and caused two deep pits to be dug. And
the places of pilgrimage came there in bodily shape; and having
mentioned their names, and thrown water into the pits, departed. After
this Shree Krishnù,

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

having bathed in the pits, on coming out, made an offering of a great
many cows, and having fed many Brahmins, was purified. And from that
day, the two pits became famous as the pit of Krishnù, and the pit of
Radhika.

Having finished narrating this incident, Shree Shookdeo, the sage,
said,--O great king! one day, Narud Jee, the sage, came to Kuns; and
when he had explained to him the secrets of the birth of Bulram and
Krishnù, and of the coming of the delusive power, and of the going off
of Krishnù, Kuns was angry, and said, "You speak truth. At first, he
brought his son and gave him to me, having by that means increased the
confidence of my mind: as a thug, who shows you something, and
afterwards runs off with all your property."

On saying these words, having sent for Basoodeo, he had him bound down,
and putting his hand on his sword, said with great agitation of mind, "I
have discovered that you acted with great treachery towards me. I looked
upon you as a good and virtuous man. You sent Krishnù off, and gave him
to Nund; Dewee has come and shown me. Your words corresponded not with
your thoughts and designs; I will certainly put you to death to-day on
this spot. A friend, relation, attendant or person professing great
regard for another, who practices deceit, is very sinful. Your words
were sweet, but your mind filled with poison. You were intent only on
deceit. An evil spirit is better than one who acts maliciously in
affairs which concern himself."

Speaking in this vain, foolish manner, Kuns said again to Narud Jee, "O
great king! I have not yet found out the secrets of his mind: a boy was
born, and he came and showed me a girl. The child, which he mentioned as
having died in consequence of the mother's miscarriage, was born at
Gokool as Buldeo." Thus having said, he gnashed his teeth with rage: and
as he raised his sword to kill Basoodeo, Narud, the sage, having laid
hold of his hand, said, "Raja! keep Basoodeo a prisoner for the present,
and arrange so that you may lay

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

hold of Krishnù and Buldeo, (or so that Krishnù and Buldeo may come
here.)"

When Narud Jee had made this suggestion and departed Kuns shut up
Basoodeo and Dewukee in a room; and being distracted with fear, sent for
a devil, named Kesee, and said to him, "O possessed of great strength!
you are one of my retainers. I have great confidence in you. Go at once
to Bruj, and having killed Bulram and Krishnù, show their bodies to me."

Kesee, on hearing this speech, and receiving the order, bowing his head,
took leave, and went to Brindabun. And Kuns summoned Sal, Toosal,
Chanoor, Arisht, Byomasoor and all his other counsellors. On their
arrival, he explained to them and said, "My enemy has taken up his abode
near me; reflect and deliberate how you can draw out the thorn which is
pricking my mind."

The counsellors said, "O great king! you are very powerful, whom do you
fear? What great difficulty will be in destroying Bulram and Krishnù? Be
not at all anxious. We will counsel you, how, by means of stratagem and
force, they will come here. First of all we will cause to be built such
a beautiful and elegant theatre, that on hearing of its splendour people
will crowd from towns and villages to see it. After this, do you cause a
sacrifice to be made to Muhadeo, and procure goats and buffaloes for the
burnt-offering. On hearing news of this, all the inhabitants of Bruj
will bring presents, and Bulram and Krishnù will come with them. Then
some wrestler will throw them down, or some other very strong man will
kill them at the gate."

On hearing these suggestions, Kuns assenting to the advice, said,
"Counsellors! you have given good counsel." He sent for a wrestler, and
having treated him with great respect gave him a beera of betel.

After this, holding a court, he began to say to his powerful devils,
"When my nephews, Bulram and Krishnù, come here,

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

one of you destroy them, that the apprehensions of my mind may be
removed." Having thus explained to them, he sent for a mahout and said
to him, "You have a must elephant under you, take it to the gate and
remain there. When the two brothers come and attempt to enter, have them
torn to pieces by the elephant, and do not give them a chance of escape.
If you will destroy them both, I will give you whatever wealth you may
ask for."

Having thus explained to them all, and determined upon a sacrifice to
Shivù on the fourteenth of the dark part of the month Kartik, Kuns sent
for Akroor in the evening; and having given him a most civil reception,
took him inside his house; giving him a seat on a throne near him, and
laying hold of his hand, he said with the greatest affection, "You are
the greatest in the family of Judoo; intelligent, religious and
resolute; and, therefore, all know and respect you. There is no one, who
is not pleased at seeing you. For this reason, as a dwarf, (the fifth
incarnation of Vishnù,) accomplished, an important business for Indrù,
having by stratagem taken possession of the whole government of Bali,
the sovereign of the infernal regions, and made it over to Indrù; so do
you perform an important action for me, and go at once to Brindabun, and
bring the two sons of Dewukee here; in whatever way the affair may be
managed, whether by artifice or force. It is said, that the great endure
difficulties themselves in accomplishing the objects of others; you have
the same interest in all my affairs as myself. What more shall I say;
bring them here in any way you can, and they will easily be destroyed.
Either Chanoor will throw them prostrate, or the elephant Koobliya will
lay hold of and tear them to pieces. If not, I, myself, will kill them,
and accomplish my object with my own hand. And after having destroyed
them, I will put Oogursen to death; because he is very deceitful and
desires my destruction. And after that, having first burnt Dewukee's
father, Dewuk, I will drown him. Having

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

thus put Basoodeo to death with him, I will thus destroy by the very
roots all the worshippers of Huri. Then, if you will but bring Bulram
and Krishnù, reigning without any opposition, I will unite with my very
powerful friend, Joorasindh, from dread of whom, the nine divisions of
the world tremble; and with Nurkasoor, and Banasoor, and other great and
mighty demons, who are his attendants."

Kuns continued to urge Akroor, saying, "Go to Brindabun to the house of
Nund, and tell him, that a sacrifice is about to be made to Shivù; the
bow has been placed upon it, and that there will be all kinds of sports
and pastimes; on hearing this Nund and Oopunud will come with the
cowherds, and bring goats and buffaloes to offer as presents, and
Krishnù and Buldeo will accompany them to see what goes on. This is the
plan I suggest to you for bringing them here. Hereafter, as you are
possessed of great knowledge, if it should be necessary to slake up any
other story, do so, and act accordingly. What more need I say? There is
a saying, If the ambassador is a man of wonderful capacity, who
possesses understanding and power himself, and is bold in others'
affairs, place implicit confidence in him."

On hearing these speeches, Akroor thought to himself, "If I were now to
speak honestly to him, and give him good advice, he would not listen to
it: wherefore, it is better that I should now say what may be flattering
and agreeable to him. There is also a saying, applied in another sense,
that we should make speeches, which will please." With these thoughts in
his mind, Akroor joined his hands, and bowing his head, said, "O great
king! you have given good advice. I give my most full consent and
approbation to all you have said. We have no power over the future. Man
busies himself forming many projects: but those alone, which are written
in fate, are brought to completion. The event does not always correspond
with our thoughts; and no man has all his wishes fulfilled. You have
considered this business,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

predicting the future: we know not what may happen. In compliance with
what you have said, I will go off to-morrow morning early, and bring
Bulram and Krishnù." On saying this, Akroor having obtained the
permission of Kuns to depart, came to his own house.
