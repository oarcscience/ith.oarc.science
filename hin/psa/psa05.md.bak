### CHAPTER IV.

SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--Raja! At the time Shree Krishnù Chund was
about to be born, such joy arose in the minds of all men, that the name
even of grief did not remain. Through delight the forests and groves
being green began to produce flowers and fruits; the rivers, nullahs and
ponds to be filled with water; birds of different kinds to sport and hop
about; and there were rejoicings in every city, village and house;
Brahmins offered up sacrifices; the guardians of the ten quarters were
delighted; clouds rolled over Brujmundul; the gods seated in their
chariots rained flowers from the sky, the celestial dancers, musicians,
bands, playing upon drums and pipes began to sing praises; and in one
quarter Oorbusee and all the celestial courtezans were dancing. Under
such a combination of circumstances on the eighth of the dark part of
the month of Bhadon, in the Rohnee division of the zodiack, on a
Wednesday at midnight, Shree Krishnù Jee was born; and being of the
colour of a cloud, with a face like the moon, lotus-eyed, wearing a
yellow vest, with a crown on his head, and adorned with the
byjuntee--necklace, composed of jewels, produced from the five elements
of nature, and having ornaments studded with jewels, in a form with

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

four arms, holding a shell, quoit, club, and a lotus, he appeared before
Basoodeo and Dewukee. On seeing him, both being amazed imagined him to
be the first mortal; then joining their hands, they submissively said,
"Great is our good fortune, that you have shown yourself to us, and
given us a release from birth and death."

Having thus spoken, they narrated the first part of the history, how
Kuns had caused them affliction; upon this, Shree Krishnù Chund, said,
"Do not now suffer any anxiety of mind, because I have descended upon
the earth to dispel your griefs, but carry me now to Gokool; and at this
very time Jusodha has had a daughter, which take and deliver to Kuns;
listen to the reason of my going, which I will explain. Nund and Jusodha
have performed religious penance; fixing their affections upon me, they
desire to see their child's happiness: I will go and stay some days with
them. Hereafter, after having killed Kuns, I will return to you: keep up
your confidence."

Having made this explanation to Basoodeo and Dewukee, Shree Krishnù
being transformed into an infant, began to cry, and dissipated his
delusion--And upon this, all the knowledge of Basoodeo and Dewukee
departed, and they supposed the infant to be their own son. Thinking
thus, and having made a vow in their minds to offer up ten thousand
cows, they took the child in their arms and fondled it. On looking at
its face, both heaving deep sighs, began to say to each other, "Let us
contrive some means of carrying off this infant, that he may escape from
the hands of that sinner Kuns." Basoodeo said, "Without the assistance
of Bruhmù, no one will be able to support him; whatever has been written
in fate, that will happen." Then joining. her hands Jusodha said, "Your
friend Nund lives at Gokool:--Jusodha will dispel our troubles, and
there is your wife Rohnee.--Take this infant there." On hearing this,
Basoodeo said with agitation, "How shall I escape from these strong

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

fastenings?" Upon this, all their handcuffs and chains upon their legs
fell off; the doors flew open on all four sides: the watchmen, off their
guard, were fast asleep.

Basoodeo Jee having then placed Shree Krishnù in a basket, put it on his
head, and went off immediately to Gokool-Above the gods were pouring
rain, behind him lions roared. Basoodeo became anxious, on beholding the
great stream of the Jumna.

Standing on the bank of the river, Basoodeo began to reflect "that
behind lions are roaring, and in front the fathomless Jumna is flowing,
what shall I do now?" Saying this, and fixing his thoughts upon Bhugwan,
he went into the Jumna; and the depth of the river increased as he
advanced. When the water came up to his nose, he was very much
frightened-Perceiving that he was agitated, Shree Krishnù, extending his
foot, uttered the mystical sound, "*hoon*," and in consequence of the
stretching out of his foot, the Jumna became fordable. Basoodeo having
crossed the river, came to Nund's house, and found the doors open; on
going in, he found all asleep. Dewee had thrown her into such a trance,
that Jusodha was not conscious of having been delivered of a girl.
Basoodeo, having put Krishnù asleep by the side of Jusodha, and taken
away her infant daughter, quickly returned homeward. After re-crossing
the river, he came to the spot where Dewukee was sitting in anxious
thought. Having given her the little girl, he told her all the news of
his journey. On hearing the account, Jusodha, delighted with joy,
exclaimed, "O husband! what need we care now, if Kuns should put us to
death, since our son has escaped from the hands of that demon." Having
told thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja
Pureechit, When Basoodeo had brought the female infant, the doors of
their prison became closed as before, and both had chains and handcuffs
fastened on again--the little girl began to cry. On hearing the noise or
the crying, the sentinels awoke, and snatching up their arms, and being
on the alert,

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

began to fire their muskets. On hearing their report, the elephants
began to scream, lions to roar, and dogs to bark. At this time amidst
the darkness of night, and in the rain, a sentinel came, and having
joined his hands, said to Kuns, "O great king! your enemy has been
born." On hearing this, Kuns fell down insensible.
