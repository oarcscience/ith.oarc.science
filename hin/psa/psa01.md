### PREFACE TO THE TRANSLATION

###### OF THE

# PREM SAGUR.

THE object of this translation is to render the work easily intelligible
to the young Student: in fact, to assist the beginner from the
commencement of his study of the PREM SAGUR, in understanding what he is
reading about, and the explanations of his Pundit.

With this view, I have endeavoured to make the translation a tolerably
literal one, keeping close to what I considered to be the meaning of the
text, without, however, wishing to translate every sentence exactly
literally.

The Hindee language is well worthy the careful study of every public
Officer in India, as being the one, which is most commonly spoken by
inhabitants of almost every part of the country. To the Military man
this language is of special use, as it not only enables him thoroughly
to understand his men on points of common occurrence and of duty; but by
being able to converse freely with them, to study their habits, manners,
customs, their general turn of thought and opinions.

The Hindee of the PREM SAGUR is remarkably pure, and the book is, I
believe, an Examination Book at all the Presidencies.
