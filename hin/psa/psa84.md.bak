### CHAPTER LXXXIII.

SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! listen, whilst I gave an account
of the conversations which passed between Dropudee and the wives of
Shree Krishnù Chund Jee. One day the wives of the Kouruvùs and Panduvùs
were sitting with the wives of Shree Krishnù Chund Jee, and were
celebrating the exploits and good qualities of Krishnù; upon something
being said in conversation, Dropudee said to Shree Rookmunee Jee, "Say,
O beautiful Rookmunee! how didst thou obtain Shree Krishnù Chund Jee?"
Shree Rookmunee replied, "Listen attentively, O Dropudee! how Krishnù
carried his scheme into execution: my father's wish was to give his
daughter to Shree Krishnù Chund, and my brother had set his mind upon
giving me to Raja Sissoopal, who came with a marriage procession to
celebrate the marriage; and I sent a brahmin and invited Shree Krishnù
Chund Jee. On the marriage day, as I returned home after having offered
adoration to Devee, Shree Krishnù Chund Jee having carried me off from
the midst of the army of the demons, seated me on his chariot, and
pursued his journey homewards. Having afterwards received intelligence
of this event, the whole army of demons came and made a violent attack
upon Huri, who easily slew and put them to flight, he then

set out for Dwarka, taking me with him. On our arrival there, Rajas
Oogursen, Soorsen and Basoodeo Jee married me to Shree Krishnù Chund,
according to the prescribed injunctions of the Vedas; and, having heard
the news of the marriage, my father gave me a most liberal dowry."

Having recited thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja
Pureechit,--O great king! Dropudee Jee made enquiries, similar to that
she had made from Shree Rookmunee, from Sutbhama, Jamwutee, Kalindee,
Bhudrù, Sutya, Mittrabinda, Luchmuna, and the sixteen thousand and eight
hundred queens of Shree Krishnù Chund, and each explained all the
circumstances and the history of her marriage.
