### CHAPTER LXXIV.

SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! Shree Krishnù Chund Jee having
seated Suhdeo on the royal throne; and, having given him advice, said to
him, "Raja! go now and bring those Rajas, whom your father kept shut up
in a hill cave." On hearing these words from the mouth of Krishnù,
Joorasindhoo's son, Suhdeo, consenting to bring them, went to the cave;
and, having removed a stone from the mouth of it, brought forth twenty
thousand eight hundred Rajas, and took them to the presence of Huri. On
coming there with handcuffs and leg-irons, iron collars on their necks,
their nails and hair grown long, bodies emaciated, depressed in spirits,
and dirty in appearance, all the Rajas stood in rows before Krishnù,
joining their hands, they submissively said, "O sea of compassion and
brother of the poor! you have thought of us in good time, otherwise we
should have died; by seeing you our lives have been restored, and our
former griefs have been obliterated."

On hearing these words, O great king! when Shree Krishnù Chund, the sea
of favour, looked upon them; Suhdeo immediately took them away; and,
having had their handcuffs, leg-irons and the rings with which their
fetters were fastened, cut off, causing them to be shaved and bathed,
and washed, entertaining them with all sorts of delicacies, giving them
clothes

and ornaments, and furnishing them with arms, brought them again into
Huri's presence; at that time Shree Krishnù Chund Jee appeared to them
in a form with four arms, and holding a shell, quoit, club and lotus. On
beholding the form Krishnù had assumed, the Rajas joining their hands
said, "Lord! you liberate mortals from the difficult bonds of the world;
what difficulty was there to you to release us from the imprisonment of
Joorasindhoo? As you have compassionately released us from this severe
confinement, release us also from this well in the form of a dwelling,
free us from desire, anger, avarice and inordinate affection, in order
that we may sit down in retirement and meditate on you, and cross over
the sea of the world."

Shree Shookdeo Jee said, Raja! when all the Rajas had spoken these
words, so full of knowledge and devotion, Shree Krishnù Chund Jee was
delighted and said, "They who worship me with sincerity of mind, shall
certainly obtain deliverance and salvation; bondage and release are
trials of the mind, to him whose mind is firm; the house and forest are
alike; have no other anxiety in your minds, than living happily at your
homes; carry on a well regulated government, protect the subject; attend
upon the cow and brahmin; do not speak falsely; avoid lust, anger,
avarice and pride; worship Huri with sentiments of religion, and you
will certainly obtain eternal happiness; whoever, coming into the world,
has indulged in pride, has not lived long; behold! how many pride has
brought to destruction. His strength destroyed Pursooram, celebrated as
being very powerful, and having a thousand arms. Raja Bynoo became
Rawun, and was ruined by his pride. Bhomasoor and Banasoor, and Kuns
were all exterminated through pride. Let no one be intoxicated with
prosperity, or indulge in pride; he who shuns pride may live without
fear."

Having thus spoken, Shree Krishnù Chund said to all the Rajas, "Go now
to your homes, have meetings with you

relations, arrange the affairs of your kingdoms and settle yourselves
upon your thrones, and come quickly, about the time of my own arrival,
to Hustinapoor, to the Raja Joodisthur's, to assist at the royal
sacrifice."

O great king! when Shree Krishnù Chund Jee had thus spoken, Suhdeo
instantly procured all things necessary for the departure of the Rajas.
They received them; and, taking leave of Krishnù, went each to his own
country, and Shree Krishnù Chund Jee also travelled thence joyfully,
accompanied by Suhdeo and Bheem, and Urjoon, and came to Hustinapoor.
Krishnù having gone, after his arrival, to the Raja Joodisthur,
explained to him all the circumstances, attending the death of
Joorasindhoo, and the release of the Rajas.

Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the
Raja Pureechit,--O great king! about the time of the arrival of Shree
Krishnù Chund, the root of joy, at Hustinapoor, the Rajas arrived also
with their armies, and with presents; and, having had an interview with
Raja Joodisthur, and offered their presents, they encamped on all sides
of Hustinapoor by order of Shree Krishnù Chund Jee, and prepared to
assist in the sacrifice.
