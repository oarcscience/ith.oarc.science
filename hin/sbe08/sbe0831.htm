After this I shall explain the science of concentration of mind, than which there is nothing higher, (and which teaches) how devotees concentrating (their minds) perceive the perfect self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1173"></A><A HREF="#fn_1168"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. I will impart instruction regarding it accurately. Learn from me the paths&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1174"></A><A HREF="#fn_1169"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> by which one directing the self within the self perceives the eternal &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1175"></A><A HREF="#fn_1170"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> (principle). Restraining the senses, one should fix the mind on the self; and having first performed rigorous penance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1176"></A><A HREF="#fn_1171"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, he should practise concentration of mind for final emancipation. Then the talented Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, who has practised penance, who is constantly practising concentration of mind, should act on (the precepts of) the science of concentration of mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1177"></A><A HREF="#fn_1172"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, seeing the self in the self by means of the mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1178"></A><A HREF="#fn_1173"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. If such a good man is able to concentrate the self on the self, then he, being habituated to exclusive meditation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1179"></A><A HREF="#fn_1174"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, perceives the self in the self.

<P>self-restrained and self-possessed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1180"></A><A HREF="#fn_1175"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and always concentrating his mind, and having his senses subjugated, he who has achieved proper concentration of mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1181"></A><A HREF="#fn_1176"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> sees the self in the self, As a person having seen one in a dream, recognises him (afterwards), saying, 'This is he;' so does one who has achieved proper concentration of mind perceive the self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1182"></A><A HREF="#fn_1177"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. And as one may show the soft fibres, after extracting them from the Mu&ntilde;<I>g</I>a, so does a devotee see the self extracted from the body. The body is caned the Mu&ntilde;<I>g</I>a; the soft fibres stand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1183"></A><A HREF="#fn_1178"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> for the self. This is the excellent illustration propounded by those who understand concentration of mind. When an embodied (self) properly perceives the self concentrated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1184"></A><A HREF="#fn_1179"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, then there is no ruler over him, since he is the lord of the triple world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1185"></A><A HREF="#fn_1180"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.

<P>has acquired concentration of mind, and who is self-restrained, creates for himself even the divinity of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1186"></A><A HREF="#fn_1181"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and abandoning the transient body, he attains to the inexhaustible Brahman. When (all) beings are destroyed, he has no fear; when (all) beings are afflicted, he is not afflicted by anything&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1187"></A><A HREF="#fn_1182"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. He whose self is concentrated, who is free from attachment, and of a tranquil mind, is not shaken by the fearful effects of attachment and affection&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1188"></A><A HREF="#fn_1183"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, which consist in pain and grief&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1189"></A><A HREF="#fn_1184"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. Weapons do not pierce him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1190"></A><A HREF="#fn_1185"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; there is, no death for him; nothing can be seen anywhere in the world happier than he. Properly concentrating his self, he remains steady to the self; and freed from old age and grief, he sleeps at ease. Leaving this human frame, he assumes bodies at pleasure. But one who is practising concentration should never become despondent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1191"></A><A HREF="#fn_1186"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. When one who has properly achieved concentration perceives the self in the self, then he forthwith ceases to feel any attachment to Indra himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1192"></A><A HREF="#fn_1187"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Now listen how one habituated to exclusive meditation attains concentration. Thinking&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1193"></A><A HREF="#fn_1188"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of a quarter seen before, he should steady his mind within and not out of the city in which he dwells. Remaining within (that) city, he should place his mind both in its external and internal (operations) in that habitation in which he dwells. When, meditating in that habitation, he perceives the perfect one, his mind should not in anyway wander outside. Restraining the group of the senses, in a forest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1194"></A><A HREF="#fn_1189"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> free from noises and unpeopled, he should meditate on the perfect one within his body with a mind fixed on one point. He</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A></P>
<P>should meditate on his teeth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1195"></A><A HREF="#fn_1190"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, palate, tongue, neck, and throat likewise, and also the heart, and likewise the seat of the. heart. That talented pupil, O destroyer of Madhu! having been thug instructed by me, proceeded further to interrogate (me) about the piety (required) for final emancipation, which is difficult to explain. 'How does this food eaten from time to time become digested in the stomach? How does it turn to juice, and how also to blood? And how, too, do the flesh, and marrow, and muscles, and bones--which all (form) the bodies for embodied (selfs)--develop in a woman as that (self) develops? How, too, does the strength develop? (And how is it also) about the removal of non-nutritive (substances)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1196"></A><A HREF="#fn_1191"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and of the excretions, distinctly? How, too, does he breathe inwards or outwards? And what place does the self occupy, dwelling in the self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1197"></A><A HREF="#fn_1192"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>? And how does the soul moving about carry the body? And of what colour and of what description (is it when) he leaves it? O sinless venerable sir! be pleased to state this accurately to me.' Thus questioned by that Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, O M&acirc;dhava! I replied&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1198"></A><A HREF="#fn_1193"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, 'O you of mighty arms! O</P>

<P>restrainer of (your) foes! according to what (I had) heard. As one placing any property in his store-room should fix his mind on the property&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1199"></A><A HREF="#fn_1194"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, so placing one's mind in one's body, and (keeping) the passages confined, one should there look for the self and avoid heedlessness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1200"></A><A HREF="#fn_1195"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Being thus always assiduous and pleased in the self, he attains in a short time to that Brahman, after perceiving which he understands the Pradh&acirc;na&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1201"></A><A HREF="#fn_1196"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. He is not to be grasped by the eye, nor by any of the senses. Only by the mind (used) as a lamp is the great self perceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1202"></A><A HREF="#fn_1197"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. He has hands and feet on all sides; he has eyes, heads, and faces on all sides; he has cars on all sides; he stands pervading everything in the world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1203"></A><A HREF="#fn_1198"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. The soul sees the self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1204"></A><A HREF="#fn_1199"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> come out from the body; and abandoning his body, he perceives the self,--holding it to be the immaculate Brahman,--with, as it were, a mental smile&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1205"></A><A HREF="#fn_1200"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>. And then depending upon it thus, he attains final emancipation in me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1206"></A><A HREF="#fn_1201"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>.</P>

<P>This whole mystery I have declared to you, O best of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1207"></A><A HREF="#fn_1202"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>! I will now take my leave, I will go away; and do you (too) go away, O Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a! according to your pleasure.' Thus addressed by me, O K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a! that pupil, possessed of great penance,--that Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a of rigid vows,--went away as he pleased.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">V&acirc;sudeva said:</P>
<P>Having spoken to me, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! these good words relating to the piety (required) for final emancipation, that best of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as disappeared then and there. Have you listened to this, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! with a mind (fixed) on (this) one point only&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1208"></A><A HREF="#fn_1203"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>? For on that occasion, too, sitting in the chariot you heard this same (instruction). It is my belief, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! that this is not easily understood by a man who is confused, or who has not acquired knowledge with his inmost soul purified&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1209"></A><A HREF="#fn_1204"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. What I have spoken, O chief of the descendants of Bharata! is a great mystery (even) among the gods. And it has never yet been heard by any man in this world, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;! For, O sinless one! there is no other man than you worthy to hear it. Nor is it easily to be understood by (one whose) internal self (is) confused.

<P>actions. And the gods are not pleased with a cessation of the mortal form&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1211"></A><A HREF="#fn_1206"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. For as to that eternal Brahman, O son of Prith&acirc;! that is the highest goal, where one, forsaking the body, reaches immortality and is ever happy. Adopting this doctrine, even those who are of sinful birth, women, Vai<I>s</I>yas, and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras likewise, attain the supreme goal. What then (need be said of) Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, O son of P<I>ri</I>th&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1212"></A><A HREF="#fn_1207"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>! or well-read Kshatriyas, who are constantly intent on their own duties, and whose highest goal is the world of the Brahman? This has been stated with reasons; and also the means for its acquisition; and the fruit of its full accomplishment, final emancipation, and determination regarding misery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1213"></A><A HREF="#fn_1208"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. O chief of the descendants of Bharata! there can be no other happiness beyond this. The mortal, O son of P&acirc;<I>n</I>du! who, possessed of talents, full of faith, and energetic&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1214"></A><A HREF="#fn_1209"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, casts aside as unsubstantial the (whole) substance of this world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1215"></A><A HREF="#fn_1210"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, he forthwith attains the highest goal by these means. This is all that is to be said, there is nothing further than this.

<P><A NAME="fn_1188"></A><A HREF="sbe0831.htm#fr_1193">251:1</A> This is all rather mystical. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a takes 'city' to mean body,' and 'habitation' to mean the m&ucirc;l&acirc;dh&acirc;ra, or other similar mystic centre within the body, where, according to the Yoga philosophy, the soul is sometimes to be kept with the life-winds, &amp;c. 'Thinking of a quarter,' &amp;c., he explains to mean 'meditating on the instruction he has received after studying the Upanishads.' I do not understand the passage well. 'City' for 'body' is a familiar use of the word. Cf. G&icirc;t&acirc;, <A HREF="sbe0807.htm#page_65">p. 65</A>. The original word for habitation occurs at Aitareya-upanishad, p. 199, where <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara explains it to mean 'seat.' Three 'seats' are there mentioned,--the organs of sight, &amp;c.; the mind; and the &Acirc;k&acirc;<I>s</I>a in the heart. There, too, the body is described as a 'city,' and Anandagiri explains habitation to mean 'seat of amusement or sport.' Here, however, the meaning seems to be that one should work for concentration in the manner indicated, viz. first fix the mind on the city where one dwells, then on the particular part of it oftenest seen before, them one's own habitation, then the various parts of one's body, and finally one's own heart and the Brahman within it. Thus gradually circumscribed in its operations, the mind is better fitted for the final concentration on the Brahman. As to external and internal operations, cf. note &nbsp;<A HREF="#fn_1163"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, <A HREF="#page_247">p. 247</A>. The perfect one is the Brahman. Cf.

The latter expression Ar<I>g</I>una Mi<I>s</I>ra seems to render by 'mind.'
