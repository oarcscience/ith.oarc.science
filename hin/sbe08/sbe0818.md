# CHAPTER XVI.

Freedom from fear, purity of heart, perseverance in (pursuit of)
knowledge and abstraction of mind, gifts <span
id="fr_483"></span>[2](#fn_482.md), self-restraint <span
id="fr_484"></span>[2](#fn_482.md), and sacrifice, study of the Vedas,
penance, straightforwardness, harmlessness, truth <span
id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_482.md), freedom from anger, renunciation <span
id="fr_486"></span>[3](#fn_483.md), tranquillity, freedom from the habit of
backbiting <span id="fr_487"></span>[4](#fn_484), compassion for (all.md)
beings, freedom from avarice, gentleness, modesty, absence of vain
activity, noblemindedness, forgiveness, courage, purity, freedom from a
desire to injure others, absence of vanity, (these), O descendant of
Bharata! are his who is born to godlike endowments. Ostentatiousness,
pride, vanity <span id="fr_488"></span>[5](#fn_485.md), anger, and also
harshness and ignorance (are) his, O son of P*ri*thâ! who is born to
demoniac <span id="fr_489"></span>[6](#fn_486.md) endowments. Godlike
endowments are deemed to be (means) for

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

final emancipation, demoniac for bondage <span
id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_487.md). Grieve not, O descendant of Bharata!
you are born to godlike endowments. (There are) two classes of created
beings in this world, the godlike and the demoniac; the godlike (class)
has been described at length; now hear from me, O son of P*ri*thâ! about
the demoniac. Demoniac persons know not action or inaction <span
id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_488), neither purity nor yet (correct.md)
conduct nor veracity are in them. They say the universe is devoid of
truth <span id="fr_492"></span>[3](#fn_489.md), devoid of fixed
principle <span id="fr_493"></span>[4](#fn_490.md), and devoid of a ruler,
produced by union (of male and female) caused by lust <span
id="fr_494"></span>[5](#fn_491.md), and nothing else. Holding this view,
(these) enemies of the world, of ruined <span
id="fr_495"></span>[6](#fn_492.md) selfs, of little knowledge, and of
ferocious actions, are born for the destruction (of the world).
Entertaining insatiable desire, full of vanity, ostentatiousness, and
frenzy, they adopt false notions <span id="fr_496"></span>[7](#fn_493.md)
through delusion, and engage in unholy observances. Indulging in
boundless thoughts ending with death <span
id="fr_497"></span>[8](#fn_494.md), given up to the enjoyment of objects of
desire, being resolved that that is all, bound down by nets of hopes in
hundreds, given up to anger and desire, they wish

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

to obtain heaps of wealth unfairly for enjoying objects of desire. 'This
have I obtained to-day; this wish I will obtain; this wealth is mine;
and this also shall be mine; this foe I have killed; others too I will
destroy; I am lord, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect <span
id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_495.md), strong, happy; I have wealth; I am of
noble birth; who else is like me? I will sacrifice <span
id="fr_499"></span>[2](#fn_496.md); I will make gifts; I will rejoice.'
Thus deluded by ignorance, tossed about by numerous thoughts, surrounded
by the net of delusion, and attached to the enjoyment of objects of
desire, they fall down into impure hell. Honoured (only) by themselves,
void of humility, and full of the pride and frenzy of wealth, these
calumniators (of the virtuous) perform sacrifices, which are sacrifices
only in name, with ostentatiousness and against prescribed rules <span
id="fr_500"></span>[3](#fn_497); indulging (their.md) vanity, brute force,
arrogance, lust, and anger; and hating me in their own bodies and in
those of others <span id="fr_501"></span>[4](#fn_498.md). These
enemies <span id="fr_502"></span>[5](#fn_499.md), ferocious, meanest of
men, and unholy, I continually hurl down, to these worlds <span
id="fr_503"></span>[6](#fn_500.md), only into demoniac wombs. Coming into
demoniac wombs, deluded in every birth, they go down to the vilest
state, O son of Kuntî! without ever coming to me. Threefold is this way,
to hell,--

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

ruinous to the self <span
id="fr_504"></span>[1](sbe0819.htm#fn_501.md),--lust, anger, and likewise
avarice; therefore one should abandon this triad. Released from these
three ways to darkness, O son of Kuntî! a man works out his own welfare,
and then proceeds to the highest goal. He <span
id="fr_505"></span>[2](sbe0819.htm#fn_502.md) who abandoning scripture
ordinances, acts under the impulse of desire, does not attain
perfection <span id="fr_506"></span>[3](sbe0819.htm#fn_503.md), nor
happiness, nor the highest goal. Therefore in discriminating between w
hat should be done and what should not be done, your authority (must.
be) scripture. And knowing what is declared by the ordinances of
scripture, you should perform action in this world.
