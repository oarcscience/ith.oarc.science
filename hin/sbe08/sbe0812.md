# CHAPTER X.

Yet again, O you of mighty arms! listen to my excellent <span
id="fr_343"></span>[2](#fn_342) words, which, out of a wish for your
welfare, I speak to you who are delighted (with them). Not the
multitudes of gods, nor the great sages know my source; for I am in
every way <span id="fr_344"></span>[3](#fn_343) the origin of the gods
and great sages. Of (all) mortals, he who knows me to be unborn, without
beginning, the great lord of the world, being free from delusion, is
released from all sins. Intelligence, knowledge, freedom from delusion,
forgiveness, truth, restraint of the senses, tranquillity, pleasure,
pain, birth, death, fear, and also security, harmlessness, equability,
contentment, penance, (making) gifts, glory, disgrace, all these
different tempers <span id="fr_345"></span>[4](#fn_344) of living beings
are from me alone. The seven great sages, and likewise the four ancient
Manus <span id="fr_346"></span>[5](#fn_345), whose descendants are (all)
these people in the world, were all born from my

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

mind <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_346), (partaking) of my powers.
Whoever correctly knows these powers and emanations of mine, becomes
possessed of devotion free from indecision; of this (there is) no doubt.
The wise, full of love <span id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_347), worship
me, believing that I am the origin of all, and that all moves on through
me. (Placing their) minds on me, offering (their) lives to me,
instructing each other, and speaking about me, they are always contented
and happy. To these, who are constantly devoted, and who worship with
love,, I give that knowledge by which they attain to me. And remaining
in their hearts, I destroy, with the brilliant lamp of knowledge, the
darkness born of ignorance in such (men) only, out of compassion for
them.

Ar*g*una said:

You are the supreme Brahman, the supreme goal, the holiest of the holy.
All sages, as well as the divine sage Nârada, Asita <span
id="fr_349"></span>[3](#fn_348), Devala, and Vyâsa, call you the eternal
being, divine, the first god, the unborn, the all-pervading. And so,
too, you tell me yourself, O Kesava! I believe all this that you tell me
(to be) true; for, O lord! neither the gods nor demons understand your
manifestation <span id="fr_350"></span>[4](#fn_349). You only know your
self by your self. O best of beings! creator of all things! lord of all
things! god of gods! lord of the universe! be pleased to declare
without, exception your divine emanations, by which emanations

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

you stand pervading all these worlds. How shall I know you, O you of
mystic power! always meditating on you? And in what various
entities <span id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_350), O lord! should I
meditate on you? Again, O Ganârdana! do you yourself declare your powers
and emanations; because hearing this nectar, I (still) feel no satiety.

The Deity said:

Well then, O best of Kauravas! I will state to you my own divine
emanations; but (only) the chief (ones), for there is no end to the
extent of my (emanations). I am the self, O Gu*d*âkesa! seated in the
hearts of all beings <span id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_351). I am the

U*kk*ai*ss*ravas <span id="fr_366"></span>[6](#fn_365), brought forth by
(the labours for) the nectar; and Airâvata among the great elephants,
and the ruler. of men among men <span id="fr_367"></span>[7](#fn_366). I
am the thunderbolt among weapons, the wish-giving (cow) among cows. And
I am love which generates <span id="fr_368"></span>[8](#fn_367). Among
serpents I am Vâsuki. Among Nâga <span id="fr_369"></span>[9](#fn_368)
snakes I am Ananta; I am Varu*n*a among aquatic beings. And I am Aryaman
among the manes, and Yama <span id="fr_370"></span>[10](#fn_369) among
rulers. Among demons, too, I am Pralhâda. I am the king of death (Kâla,
time) among those that count <span id="fr_371"></span>[11](#fn_370).
Among beasts I

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

am the lord of beasts, and the son of Vinatâ <span
id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_371) among birds. I am the wind among those

fishes I am Makara <span id="fr_375"></span>[4](#fn_374), and among
streams the *G*âhnavî <span id="fr_376"></span>[5](#fn_375). Of created
things I am the beginning and the end and the middle also, O Ar*g*una!
Among sciences, I am the science of the Adhyâtma, and I am the argument
of controversialists. Among letters I am the letter A <span
id="fr_377"></span>[6](#fn_376), and among the group of compounds the
copulative <span id="fr_378"></span>[7](#fn_377) compound. I myself am
time inexhaustible, and I the creator whose faces are in all directions.
I am death who seizes all, and the source of what is to be. And among
females, fame <span id="fr_379"></span>[8](#fn_378), fortune, speech,
memory, intellect, courage. forgiveness. Likewise among Sâman hymns, I
am the B*ri*hat-sâman <span id="fr_380"></span>[9](#fn_379), and I the
Gâyatrî <span id="fr_381"></span>[10](#fn_380) among metres. I am

among the seasons <span id="fr_382"></span>[1](#fn_381); of cheats, I am
the game of dice; I am the glory of the glorious, I am victory, I am
industry, I am the goodness of the good. I am Vâsudeva among the
descendants of V*ri*sh*ni* <span id="fr_383"></span>[2](#fn_382), and
Ar*g*una among the Pâ*nd*avas. Among sages also, I am Vyâsa <span
id="fr_384"></span>[3](#fn_383); and among the discerning ones, I am the
discerning U*s*anas <span id="fr_385"></span>[4](#fn_384). I am the rod
of those that restrain, and the policy <span
id="fr_386"></span>[5](#fn_385) of those that desire victory. I am
silence respecting secrets. I am the knowledge of those that have
knowledge And, O Ar*g*una! I am also that which is the seed of all
things. There is nothing movable or immovable which can exist without
me. O terror of your foes! there is no end to my divine emanations. Here
I have declared the extent of (those) emanations only in part. Whatever
thing (there is) of power, or glorious, or splendid, know all that to be
produced from portions of my energy. Or rather, O Ar*g*una! what have
you to do, knowing all this at large? I stand supporting all this by
(but) a single portion (of myself) <span
id="fr_387"></span>[6](#fn_386).
