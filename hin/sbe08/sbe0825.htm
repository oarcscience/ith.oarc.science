<P>This Brahman, O king! about which you question me with such perseverance, is not to be attained by anybody who is in a hurry. When the mind is absorbed in the understanding&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_822"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, then can that knowledge, which must be deeply pondered over, be attained by living the life of a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_823"></A><A HREF="#fn_818"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. For you are speaking of that primordial knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_824"></A><A HREF="#fn_819"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, which consists in the truth; which is obtained by the good by living the life of Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_825"></A><A HREF="#fn_820"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; which being obtained, men cast off this mortal world; and which knowledge, verily, is to be invariably (found) in those who have been brought up under preceptors&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_826"></A><A HREF="#fn_821"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">Dh<I>ri</I>tar&acirc;sh<I>t</I>ra said</P>

They subjugate desires here in this world, practising forbearance in pursuit of the Brahmic state&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_831"></A><A HREF="#fn_826"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and with courage, they even here remove the self out of the body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_832"></A><A HREF="#fn_827"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, like the soft fibres from the Mu&ntilde;<I>g</I>a.

He perfects&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_835"></A><A HREF="#fn_830"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> (one), giving (one) immortality. Recognising what he has done (for one), one should not injure him. The disciple should always make obeisance to the preceptor&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_836"></A><A HREF="#fn_831"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>; and, free from heedlessness, should always desire sacred instruction. When the pure man obtains knowledge by this same course of discipleship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_837"></A><A HREF="#fn_832"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A>, that is the first quarter of his life as a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin.

<P>always towards his preceptor, so likewise should he behave towards the preceptor's wife, and so likewise should he act towards the preceptor's son--(that) is said to be the second quarter. What one, recognising what the preceptor has done for one, and understanding the matter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_838"></A><A HREF="#fn_833"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (taught), feels with a delighted heart regarding the preceptor--believing that one has been brought into existence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_839"></A><A HREF="#fn_834"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by him--that is the third quarter of life as a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin.

<P>strength&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_843"></A><A HREF="#fn_838"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, bears fruit, they say, by association with a preceptor, in (the shape of) contact with that entity--the Brahman. Whatever wealth may come to man who lives in this way, he should even pay that over to the preceptor. He would thus be adopting the conduct of the good which is of many merits; and the same conduct is (to be adopted) towards the preceptor's son. Living thus, he prospers greatly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_844"></A><A HREF="#fn_839"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on all sides in this world; he obtains sons and position; the quarters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_845"></A><A HREF="#fn_840"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and sub-quarters shower (benefits&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_846"></A><A HREF="#fn_841"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>) on him, and men pass their lives as Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins under him. By this life as a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin, the divinities obtained their divinity. And the sages, too, became great by living the life of Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins. By this same (means), too, the Apsarasas, together with the Gandharvas, achieved for themselves beautiful forms. And by this life as a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin, the sun illuminates (the universe).

In the copy published in the Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata (Madras edition) there is, however, this passage: 'Wrath &amp;c. have been already explained, still there are some differences here and there, and those only are now explained.' The chapter is for the most part a repetition of what we have already had. For such repetitions cf. B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, pp. 317-1016; 444-930. The same copy of <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara's commentary gives this general statement of the object of this and the next chapter: 'The course of study of the science of the Brahman, in which knowledge is the principal thing, and concentration of mind &amp;c. are subsidiary, has been. described. Now is described the course of study in which concentration of mind is principal, and knowledge subsidiary. The first mode consists in understanding the meaning of the word "you" by means of concentration of mind, and then identifying it with the Brahman by means of a study of the Upanishads; the second, in first intellectually understanding the identity of the individual self and Brahman, by such study of the Upanishads, and then realising the identity to consciousness by contemplation, &amp;c. In both modes the fruit is the same, and the means are the same; and to show this, the merits and defects already stated are here again declared.' This explanation is verbatim the same in N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a's commentary.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_863"></A><A HREF="sbe0825.htm#fr_868">181:2</A> The original is 'pity,' which is explained to mean 'friendship' by <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara and N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_884"></A><A HREF="sbe0825.htm#fr_889">184:8</A> Cf. Mu<I>nd</I>aka, p. 277. I must own that I do not quite understand this passage, nor its explanation as given in the commentaries. I do not quite see what the penance here mentioned has to do with sacrifice, and yet the commentators seem to take the words 'since sacrifices,' &amp;c., with what precedes them, not with what follows. Taking them,. however, with what follows, it is difficult to explain the word 'since.' As far as I can understand the passage I take the sense of it to be as follows: The author having said that penance performed out of a particular motive does not lead to final emancipation, he then proceeds to point out that all 'action' or 'sacrifice' is due to an imperfect understanding of the truth (cf. <A HREF="sbe0824.htm#page_171">p. 171</A> supra), being mostly due to some particular motive. Then he goes on to show the different classes of sacrifice, and finally points out that he who is free from desires as superior to one who is actuated by desires. The original for 'misapprehension' is avabodha, which commonly means 'apprehension,' but <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara finally makes it mean moha or 'delusion.' The original for truth is rendered by N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a to mean 'fancies.' N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a says that the sacrifice by the mind is the highest; that by speech, viz. Brahmaya<I>g</I>&ntilde;a, <I>G</I>apa, &amp;c., is middling; and that by deed, viz. with clarified butter and other offerings, of the lowest class. 'Perfected by fancies' = one whose fancies are always fulfilled 'through a knowledge,' says N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a, 'of the Brahma as possessing qualities.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_885"></A><A HREF="sbe0825.htm#fr_890">185:1</A> This also is far from clear. Should it be, 'and a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a more especially?'
