# INTRODUCTION TO BHAGAVADGÎTÂ.

IT has become quite a literary commonplace, that--to borrow the words of
Professor Max Müller in one of his recent lectures--history, in the
ordinary sense of the word, is almost unknown in Indian literature <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md). And it is certainly a remarkable irony of
fate, that we should be obliged to make this remark on the very
threshold of an introduction to the Bhagavadgîtâ; for according to the
eminent French philosopher, Cousin <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md),
this great deficiency in Sanskrit literature is due, in no
inconsiderable measure, to the doctrines propounded in the Bhagavadgîtâ
itself. But however that may be, this much is certain, that the student
of the Bhagavadgîtâ must, for the present, go without that reliable
historical information touching the author of the work, the time at
which it was composed, and even the place it occupies in literature,
which one naturally desires, when entering upon the study of any work.
More especially in an attempt like the present, intended as it mainly is
for students of the history of religion, I should have been better
pleased, if I could, in this Introduction, have concentrated to a focus,
as it were, only those well ascertained historical results, on which
there is something like a consensus of opinion among persons qualified
to judge. But there is no exaggeration in saying, that it is almost
impossible to lay down even a single proposition respecting any
important matter connected with the Bhagavadgîtâ, about which any such
consensus can be said to exist. The conclusions arrived at in this
Introduction must, therefore, be distinctly

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

understood to embody individual opinions only, and must be taken
accordingly for what they are worth.

The full name of the work is Bhagavadgîtâ. In common parlance, we often
abbreviate the name into Gîtâ, and in Sanskrit literature the name
occurs in both forms. In the works of Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya, quotations
from the Gîtâ are introduced, sometimes with the words 'In the Gîtâ,' or
'In the Bhagavadgîtâ,' and sometimes with words which may be rendered
'In the Gîtâs,' the plural form being used <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md). In the colophons to the MSS. of the work,
the form current, apparently throughout India, is, 'In the Upanishads
sung (Gîtâs) by the Deity.' Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya, indeed, sometimes
calls it the Î*s*vara Gîtâ <span id="fr_3"></span>[2](#fn_3.md), which, I
believe, is the specific title of a different work altogether. The
signification, however, of the two names is identical, namely, the song
sung by the Deity, or, as Wilkins translates it, the Divine Lay.

This Divine Lay forms part of the Bhîshma Parvan of the Mahâbhârata--one
of the two well-known national epics of India. The Gîtâ gives its name
to a subdivision of the Bhîshma Parvan, which is called the Bhagavadgîtâ
Parvan, and which includes, in addition to the eighteen chapters of
which the Gîtâ consists, twelve other chapters. Upon this the question
has naturally arisen, Is the Gîtâ a genuine portion of the Mahâbhârata,
or is it a later addition? The question is one of considerable
difficulty. But I cannot help saying, that the manner in which it has
been generally dealt with is not altogether satisfactory to my mind.
Before going any further into that question, however, it is desirable to
state some of the facts on which the decision must be based. It appears,
then, that the royal family of Hastinâpura was divided into two
branches; the one called the Kauravas, and the other the Pâ*nd*avas. The
former wished to keep the latter out of the share of the kingdom claimed
by them; and so, after many attempts at

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

an amicable arrangement had proved fruitless, it was determined to
decide the differences between the two parties by the arbitrament of
arms. Each party accordingly collected its adherents, and the hostile
armies met on the 'holy field of Kurukshetra,' I mentioned in the
opening lines of our poem. At this juncture, K*ri*sh*n*a Dvaipâyana,
alias Vyâsa, a relative of both parties and endowed with more than human
powers, presents himself before Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra, the father of the
Kauravas, who is stated to be altogether blind. Vyâsa asks
Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra whether it is his wish to look with his own eyes on
the course of the battle; and on Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra's expressing his
reluctance, Vyâsa deputes one Sañ*g*aya to relate to Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra
all the events of the battle, giving to Sañ*g*aya, by means of his own
superhuman powers, all necessary aids for performing the duty. Then the
battle begins, and after a ten days' struggle, the first great general
of the Kauravas, namely Bhîshma, falls <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md). At this point Sañ*g*aya comes up to
Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra, and announces to him the sad result, which is of
course a great blow to his party. Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra then makes numerous
enquiries of Sañ*g*aya regarding the course of the conflict, all of
which Sañ*g*aya duly answers. And among his earliest answers is the
account of the conversation between K*ri*sh*n*a and Ar*g*una at the
commencement of the battle, which constitutes the Bhagavadgîtâ. After
relating to Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra that 'wonderful and holy dialogue,' and
after giving an account of what occurred in the intervals of the
conversation, Sañ*g*aya proceeds to narrate the actual events of the
battle.

With this rough outline. of the framework of the story before us, we are
now in a, position to consider the opposing arguments on the point above
noted. Mr. Talboys Wheeler writes on that point as follows <span
id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md). 'But there remains one other anomalous
characteristic of the history of the great war, as it is recorded in the
Mahâbhârata, which cannot

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

be passed over in silence; and that is the extraordinary abruptness and
infelicity with which Brahmanical discourses, such as essays on law, on
morals, sermons on divine things, and even instruction in the so-called
sciences are recklessly grafted upon the main narrative.... K*ri*sh*n*a
and Ar*g*una on the morning of the first day of the war, when both
armies are drawn out in battle-array, and hostilities are about to
begin, enter into a long and philosophical dialogue respecting the
various forms of devotion which lead to the emancipation of the soul;
and it cannot be denied that, however incongruous and irrelevant such a
dialogue must appear on the eve of battle, the discourse of K*ri*sh*n*a,
whilst acting as the charioteer of Ar*g*una, contains the essence of the
most spiritual phases of Brahmanical teaching, and is expressed in
language of such depth and sublimity, that it has become deservedly
known as the Bhagavad-gîtâ or Divine Song. . . . Indeed no effort has
been spared by the Brahmanical compilers to convert the history of the
great war into a vehicle for Brahmanical teaching; and so skilfully are
many of these interpolations interwoven with the story, that it is
frequently impossible to narrate the one, without referring to the
other, however irrelevant the matter may be to the main subject in
hand.' It appears to me, I own, very difficult to accept that as a
satisfactory argument, amounting, as it does, to no more than this--that
'interpolations,' which must needs be referred to in narrating the main
story even to make it intelligible, are nevertheless to be regarded 'as
evidently the product of a Brahmanical age <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md),' and presumably also a later age, because,
forsooth, they are irrelevant and incongruous according to the 'tastes
and ideas <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)'--not of the time, be it
remembered, when the 'main story' is supposed to have been written,
but--of this enlightened nineteenth century. The support, too, which may
be supposed to be derived by this argument from the allegation that
there has been an attempt to Brahmanize, so to say, the

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

history of the great war, appears to me to be extremely weak, so far as
the Gîtâ is concerned. But that is a point which will have to be
considered more at large in the sequel <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_7.md).

While, however, I am not prepared to admit the cogency of Mr. Wheeler's
arguments, I am not, on the other hand, to be understood as holding that
the Gîtâ must be accepted as a genuine part of the original Mahâbhârata.
I own that my feeling on the subject is something akin to that of the
great historian of Greece regarding the Homeric question, a feeling of
painful diffidence regarding the soundness of any conclusion whatever.
While it is impossible not to feel serious doubts about the critical
condition of the Mahâbhârata generally; while, indeed, we may be almost
certain that the work has been tampered with from time to time <span
id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_8.md); it is difficult to come to a satisfactory
conclusion regarding any particular given section of it. And it must be
remembered, also, that the alternatives for us to choose from in these
cases are not only these two, that the section in question may be a
genuine part of the work, or that it may be a later interpolation: but
also this, as suggested recently, though not for the first time, by Mr.
Freeman <span id="fr_10"></span>[3](#fn_9.md) with reference to the Homeric
question, that the section may have been in existence at the date of the
original epos, and may have been worked by the author of the epos into
his own production. For that absence of dread, 'either of the law or
sentiment of copyright,' which Mr. Freeman relies upon with regard to a
primitive Greek poet, was by no means confined to the Greek people, but
may be traced amongst us also. The commentator Madhusûdana Sarasvatî
likens the Gîtâ to those dialogues which occur in sundry Vedic works,
particularly the Upanishads <span id="fr_11"></span>[4](#fn_10.md).
Possibly--I will not use a stronger word--possibly the Gîtâ may

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

have existed as such a dialogue before the Mahâbhârata, and may have
been appropriated by the author of the Mahâbhârata to his own
purposes <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_11.md). But yet, upon the whole,
having regard to the fact that those ideas of unity on which Mr. Wheeler
and others set so much store are scarcely appropriate to our old
literature; to the fact that the Gîtâ fits pretty well into the setting
given to it in the Bhîshma Parvan; to the fact that the feeling of
Ar*g*una, which gives occasion to it, is not at all inconsistent, but is
most consonant, with poetical justice; to the fact that there is not in
the Gîtâ, in my judgment, any trace of a sectarian or 'Brahmanizing'
spirit <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_12.md), such as Mr. Wheeler and also
the late Professor Goldstücker <span id="fr_14"></span>[3](#fn_13.md) hold
to have animated the arrangers of the Mahâbhârata; having regard, I say,
to all these facts, I am prepared to adhere, I will not say without
diffidence, to the theory of the genuineness of the Bhagavadgîtâ as a
portion of the original Mahâbhârata.

The next point to consider is as to the authorship of the Gîtâ. The
popular notion on this subject is pretty well known. The whole of the
Mahâbhârata is, by our traditions, attributed to Vyâsa, whom we have
already noticed as a relative of the Kauravas and Pâ*nd*avas; and
therefore the Bhagavadgîtâ, also, is naturally affiliated to the same
author. The earliest written testimony to this authorship, that I can
trace, is to be found in Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya's commentary on the
Gîtâ <span id="fr_15"></span>[4](#fn_14.md) itself and on the
B*ri*hadâra*ny*akopanishad <span id="fr_16"></span>[5](#fn_15.md). To a
certain extent, the mention of Vyâsa in the body of the Gîtâ would, from
a historic standpoint, seem to militate against this tradition. But I
have not seen in any of the commentaries to which I have had access, any
consideration of this point, as there is of the mention in some

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Sm*ri*tis and Sûtras of the names of those to
whom those Sm*ri*tis and Sûtras are respectively ascribed <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_16.md).

We must now leave these preliminary questions, unluckily in a state far
from satisfactory, and proceed to that most important topic--the date
when the Gîtâ was composed, and the position it occupies in Sanskrit
literature. We have here to consider the external evidence bearing on
these points, which is tantalizingly meagre; and the internal evidence,
which is, perhaps, somewhat more full. And taking first the internal
evidence, the various items falling under that head may be marshalled
into four groups. Firstly, we have to consider the general character of
the Gîtâ with reference to its mode of handling its subject. Secondly,
there is the character of its style and language. Thirdly, we have to
consider the nature of the versification of the Gîtâ. And fourthly and
lastly, we must take note of sundry points of detail, such as the
attitude of the Gîtâ towards the Vedas and towards caste, its allusions
to other systems of speculation, and other matters of the like nature.
On each of these groups, in the order here stated, we now proceed to
make a few observations.

And first about the manner in which the Gîtâ deals with its subject. It
appears to me, that the work bears on the face of it very plain marks
indicating that it belongs to an age prior to the system-making age of
Sanskrit philosophy In 1875, I wrote as follows upon this point: 'My
view is, that in the Gîtâ and the Upanishads, the philosophical part has
not been consistently and fully worked out. We have there the results of
free thought, exercised on different subjects of great moment,
unfettered by the exigencies of any foregone conclusions, or of any
fully developed theory. It is afterwards, it is at a later stage of
philosophical progress, that system-making arises. In that stage some
thinkers interpret whole works by the light of some particular doctrines
or expressions. And the result is the development of a whole multitude
of philosophical sects, following the lead of those thinkers, and all
professing to draw their

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

doctrine from the Gîtâ or the Upanishads, yet each differing remarkably
from the other <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_17.md).' Since this was
written, Professor Max Müller's Hibbert Lectures have been published.
And I am happy to find, that as regards the Upanishads, his view
coincides exactly with that which I have expressed in the words now
quoted. Professor Max Müller says: 'There is not what may be called a
philosophical system in these Upanishads. They are in the true sense of
the word guesses at truth, frequently contradicting each other, yet all
tending in one direction <span id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_18.md).' Further
corroboration for the same view is also forthcoming. Professor
Fitz-Edward Hall, in a passage which I had not noticed before,
says <span id="fr_20"></span>[3](#fn_19.md): 'In the Upanishads, the
Bhagavadgîtâ, and other ancient Hindu books, we encounter, in
combination, the doctrines which, after having been subjected to
modifications that rendered them as wholes irreconcileable, were
distinguished, at an uncertain period, into what have for many ages been
styled the Sâ<u>n</u>khya and the Vedânta.' We have thus very weighty
authority for adhering to the view already expressed on this important
topic. But as Professor Weber appears to have expressed an opinion <span
id="fr_21"></span>[4](#fn_20.md) intended perhaps to throw some doubt on
the correctness of that view, it is desirable to go a little more into
detail to fortify it by actual reference to the contents of the Gîtâ,
the more especially as we can thus elucidate the true character of that
work. Before doing so, however, it may be pointed out, that the
proposition we have laid down is one, the test of which lies more in a
comprehensive review of the whole of the Gîtâ, than in the investigation
of small details on which there is necessarily much room for difference
of opinion.

And first, let us compare that indisputably systematized work, the
current Yoga-sûtras <span id="fr_22"></span>[5](#fn_21.md), with the
Bhagavadgîtâ on one

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

or two topics, where they both travel over common ground. In the Gîtâ,
chapter VI, stanzas 33, 34 ([p. 71](sbe0808.htm#page_71).md), we have
Ar*g*una putting what is, in substance, a question to K*ri*sh*n*a, as to
how the mind, which is admittedly 'fickle, boisterous, strong, and
obstinate,' is to be brought under control--such control having been
declared by K*ri*sh*n*a to be necessary for attaining devotion (yoga)?
K*ri*sh*n*a answers by saying that the mind may be restrained by
'practice (abhyâsa) and indifference to worldly objects (vairâgya).' He
then goes on to say, that devotion cannot be attained without
self-restraint, but that one who has self-restraint, and works to
achieve devotion, may succeed in acquiring it. Here the subject drops.
There is no further explanation of 'practice' or 'indifference to
worldly objects,' no exposition of the mode in which they work, and so
forth. Contrast now the Yoga-sûtras. The topic is there discussed at the
very outset of the work. As usual the author begins with 'Now therefore
the Yoga is to be taught.' He then explains Yoga by the well-known
definition 'Yoga is the restraint of the movements of the mind.' And
then after pointing out what the movements of the mind are, he proceeds:
'Their restraint is by means of practice and indifference to worldly
objects <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_22.md),'--the very terms, be it
remarked in passing, which are used in the Bhagavadgîtâ. But having come
thus far, the author of the Sûtras does not drop the subject as the
author of the Gîtâ does. He goes on in this wise: Practice is the effort
for keeping it steady.' 'And that becomes firmly grounded when resorted
to for a long time, without interruption, and with correct conduct.' So
far we have a discussion of the first requisite specified, namely,
practice. Patañ*g*ali then goes on to his second requisite for mental
restraint. 'Indifference to worldly objects is the consciousness of
having subdued desires &c. (Va*s*ikâra sañ*g*ñâ) which belongs to one
having no longing for objects visible and those which are heard of'
(from *S*âstras &c., such as heaven and so forth).

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

\[paragraph continues\] He next proceeds to distinguish another and
higher species of 'indifference,' and then he goes on to point out the
results of that self-restraint which is to be acquired in the mode he
has expounded. That is one instance. Now take another. In chapter VI,
stanza 10 and following stanzas, the Gîtâ sets forth elaborately the
mode of practically achieving. the mental abstraction called Yoga. It
need not be reproduced here. The reader can readily find out how sundry
directions are there given for the purpose specified, but without any
attempt at systematizing. Contrast the Yoga-sûtras. In the Sâdhanapâda,
the section treating of the acquisition of Yoga, Patañ*g*ali states in
the twenty-ninth aphorism the well-known eight elements of Yoga. Then he
subdivides these elements, and expatiates on each of them distinctly,
defining them, indicating the mode of acquiring them, and hinting at the
results which flow from them. 'That inordinate love of subdivision,'
which Dr. F. E. Hall <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) has somewhere
attributed to the Hindus, appears plainly in these aphorisms, while
there is not a trace of it in the corresponding passage in the
Bhagavadgîtâ. In my opinion, therefore, these comparisons strongly
corroborate the proposition we have laid down regarding the
unsystematic, or rather non-systematic, character of the work. In the
one we have definition, classification, division, and subdivision. In
the other we have a set of practical directions, without any attempt to
arrange them in any very scientific order. In the one you have a set of
technical terms with specific significations. In the other no such
precision is yet manifest. In one word, you have in the Gîtâ the germs,
and noteworthy germs too, of a system <span
id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_24.md), and you have most of the raw material of
a system, but you have no system ready-made.

Let us look at the matter now from a slightly different point of view.
There are sundry words used in the Bhagavadgîtâ, the significations of
which are not quite identical

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

throughout the work. Take, for instance, the word 'yoga,' which we have
rendered 'devotion.' At Gîtâ, chapter II, stanza 48 ([p.
49](sbe0804.htm#page_49).md), a definition is given of that word. In
chapter VI, the signification it bears is entirely different. And again
in chapter IX, stanza 5, there is still another sense in which the word
is used <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_25.md). The word 'Brahman' too
occurs in widely varying significations. And one of its meanings,
indeed, is quite singular, namely, 'Nature' (see chapter XIV, stanza 3).
Similar observations, to a greater or less extent, apply to the words
Buddhi, Âtman, and Svabhâva <span id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_26.md). Now
these are words which stand for ideas not unimportant in the philosophy
of the Bhagavadgîtâ. And the absence of scientific precision about their
use appears to me to be some indication of that non-systematic character
of which we have already spoken.

There is one other line of argument, which leads, I think, to the same
conclusion. There are several passages in the Gîtâ which it is not very
easy to reconcile with one another; and no attempt is made to harmonise
them. Thus, for example, in stanza 16 of chapter VII, K*ri*sh*n*a
divides his devotees into four classes, one of which consists of 'men of
knowledge,' whom, K*ri*sh*n*a says, he considers 'as his own self.' It
would probably be difficult to imagine any expression which could
indicate higher esteem. Yet in stanza 46 of chapter VI, we have it laid
down, that the devotee is superior not only to the mere performer of
penances, but even to the men of knowledge. The commentators betray
their gnostic bias by interpreting 'men of knowledge' in this latter
passage to mean those who have acquired erudition in the *S*âstras and
their significations. This is not an interpretation to be necessarily
rejected. But there is in it a certain twisting of words, which, under
the circumstances here, I am not inclined to accept. And on the other
hand, it must not be forgotten, that the implication fairly derivable
from chapter IV, stanza 38 (pp. [62](sbe0806.htm#page_62.md),
[63](sbe0806.htm#page_63).md), would seem to

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

be rather that knowledge is superior to devotion--is the higher stage to
be reached by means of devotion as the stepping-stone. In another
passage again at Gîtâ, chapter XII, stanza 12, concentration is
preferred to knowledge, which also seems to me to be irreconcileable
with chapter VII, stanza 16. Take still another instance. At Gîtâ,
chapter V, stanza 15, it is said, that 'the Lord receives the sin or
merit of none.' Yet at chapter V, stanza 29, and again at chapter IX,
stanza 24, K*ri*sh*n*a calls himself 'the Lord and enjoyer' of all
sacrifices and penances. How, it may well be asked, can the Supreme
Being 'enjoy' that which he does not even receive?' Once more, at
chapter X, stanza 29, K*ri*sh*n*a declares that 'none is hateful to me,
none dear.' And yet the remarkable verses at the close of chapter XII
seem to stand in point-blank contradiction to that declaration. There
through a most elaborate series of stanzas, the burden of K*ri*sh*n*a's
eloquent sermon is 'such a one is dear to me.' And again in those fine
verses, where K*ri*sh*n*a winds up his Divine Lay, he similarly tells
Ar*g*una, that he, Ar*g*una, is 'dear' to K*ri*sh*n*a. And K*ri*sh*n*a
also speaks of that devotee as 'dear' to him, who may publish the
Mystery of the Gîtâ among those who reverence the Supreme Being <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_27.md). And yet again, how are we to reconcile
the same passage about none being 'hateful or dear' to K*ri*sh*n*a, with
his own words at chapter XVI, stanza 18 and following stanzas? The
language used in describing the 'demoniac' people there mentioned is not
remarkable for sweetness towards them, while K*ri*sh*n*a says
positively, 'I hurl down such people into demoniac wombs, whereby they
go down into misery and the vilest condition.' These persons are
scarcely characterised with accuracy 'as neither hateful nor dear' to
K*ri*sh*n*a. It seems to me, that all these are real inconsistencies in
the Gîtâ, not such, perhaps, as might not be explained away, but such, I
think, as indicate a mind making guesses at truth., as Professor Max
Müller puts it, rather than a mind elaborating a complete

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

and organised system of philosophy. There is not even a trace of
consciousness on the part of the author that these inconsistencies
exist. And the contexts of the various passages indicate, in my
judgment, that a half-truth is struck out here, and another half-truth
there, with special reference to the special subject then under
discussion; but no attempt is made to organise the various half-truths,
which are apparently incompatible, into a symmetrical whole, where the
apparent inconsistencies might possibly vanish altogether in the higher
synthesis. And having regard to these various points, and to the further
point, that the sequence of ideas throughout the verses of the Gîtâ is
not always easily followed, we are, I think, safe in adhering to the
opinion expressed above, that the Gîtâ is a nonsystematic work, and in
that respect belongs to the same class as the older Upanishads.

We next come to the consideration of the style and language of the
Bhagavadgîtâ. And that, I think, furnishes a strong argument for the
proposition, that it belongs to an age considerably prior to the epoch
of the artificial department of Sanskrit literature--the epoch, namely,
of the dramas and poems. In its general character, the style impresses
me as quite archaic in its simplicity. Compounds, properly so called,
are not numerous; such as there are, are not long ones, and very rarely,
if ever, present any puzzle in analysing. The contrast there presented
with what is called the classical literature, as represented by Bâna or
Da*nd*in, or even Kâlidâsa, is not a little striking. In Kâlidâsa,
doubtless, the love for compounds is pretty well subdued, though I think
his works have a perceptibly larger proportion of them than the Gîtâ.
But after Kâlidâsa the love for compounds goes through a remarkable
development, till in later writings it may be said almost to have gone
mad. Even in Bâna and Da*nd*in, Subandhu and Bhavabhûti, the plethora of
compounds is often wearisome. And the same remark applies to many of the
copperplate and other inscriptions which have been recently deciphered,
and some of which date from the early centuries

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

of the Christian era. Take again the exuberance of figures and tropes
which is so marked in the classical style. There is little or nothing of
that in the Gîtâ, where you have a plain and direct style of natural
simplicity, and yet a style not by any means devoid of æsthetic merit
like the style of the Sûtra literature. There is also an almost complete
absence of involved syntactical constructions; no attempt to secure that
jingle of like sounds, which 'seems to have proved a temptation too
strong even for Kâlidâsa's muse entirely to resist. But on the contrary,
we have those repetitions of words and phrases, which are
characteristic, and not only in Sanskrit, of the style of an archaic
period <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_28.md). Adverting specially to the
language as distinguished from the style of the Gîtâ, we find such words
as Anta, Bhâshâ, Brahman, some of which are collected in the Sanskrit
Index in this volume, which have gone out of use in the classical
literature in the significations they respectively bear in the Gîtâ. The
word 'ha,' which occurs once, is worthy of special note. It is the
equivalent of 'gha,' which occurs in the Vedic Sa*m*hitâs. In the form
'ha' it occurs in the Brâhma*n*as. But it never occurs, I think, in what
is properly called the classical literature. It is, indeed, found in the
Purâ*n*as. But that is a class of works which occupies a very unique
position. There is a good deal in the Purânas that, I think, must be
admitted to be very ancient <span id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_29.md); while
undoubtedly also there is a great deal in them that is very modern. It
is, therefore, impossible to treat the use of 'ha' in that class of
works as negativing an inference of the antiquity of any book where the
word occurs; while its use in Vedic works and its total absence from
modern works indicate such antiquity pretty strongly. We may, therefore,
embody the result of this part of the discussion in the proposition,
that

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

the Gîtâ is removed by a considerable linguistic and chronological
distance from classical Sanskrit literature. And so far as it goes, this
proposition agrees with the result of our investigation of the first
branch of internal evidence.

The next branch of that evidence brings us to the character of the
versification of the Gîtâ. Here, again, a survey of Sanskrit verse
generally, and the verse of the Gîtâ in particular, leads us to a
conclusion regarding the position of the Gîtâ in Sanskrit literature,
which is in strict accord with the conclusions we have already drawn. In
the verse of the Vedic Sa*m*hitâs, there is almost nothing like a
rigidly fixed scheme of versification, no particular collocation of long
and short syllables is absolutely necessary. If we attempt to chant them
in the mode in which classical Sanskrit verse is chanted, we invariably
come across lines where the chanting cannot be smooth. If we come next
to the versification of the Upanishads, we observe some progress made
towards such fixity of scheme as we have alluded to above. Though there
are still numerous lines, which cannot be smoothly chanted, there are,
on the other hand, a not altogether inconsiderable number which can be
smoothly chanted. In the Bhagavadgîtâ a still further advance, though a
slight one, may, I think, be marked. A visibly larger proportion of the
stanzas in the Gîtâ conform to the metrical schemes as laid down by the
writers on prosody, though there are still sundry verses which do not so
conform, and cannot, accordingly, be chanted in the regular way. Lastly,
we come to the Kâvyas and Nâ*t*akas--the classical literature. And here
in practice we find everywhere a most inflexible rigidity of scheme,
while the theory is laid down in a rule which says, that 'even mâsha may
be changed to masha, but a break of metre should be avoided.' This
survey of Sanskrit verse may, I think, be fairly treated as showing,
that adhesion to the metrical schemes is one test of the chronological
position of a work--the later the work, the more undeviating is such
adhesion. I need not stay here to point out, how this view receives
corroboration from the rules given on this subject in the standard work

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

of Pi<u>n</u>gala on the *Kh*andas *S*âstra. I will only conclude this
point by saying, that the argument from the versification of the Gîtâ,
so far as it goes, indicates its position as being prior to the
classical literature, and nearly contemporaneous with the Upanishad
literature.

We now proceed to investigate the last-group of facts falling under the
head of internal evidence, as mentioned above. And first as regards the
attitude of the Gîtâ towards the Vedas. If we examine all the passages
in the Gîtâ, in which reference is made to the Vedas, the aggregate
result appears to be, that the author of the Gîtâ does not throw the
Vedas entirely overboard. He feels and expresses reverence for them,
only that reverence is of a somewhat special character. He says in
effect, that the precepts of the Vedas are suitable to a certain class
of people, of a certain intellectual and spiritual status, so to say. So
far their authority is unimpeached. But if the unwise sticklers for the
authority of the Vedas claim anything more for them than this, then the
author of the Gîtâ holds them to be wrong. He contends, on the contrary,
that acting upon the ordinances of the Vedas is an obstacle to the
attainment of the summum bonum <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_30.md).
Compare this with the doctrine of the Upanishads. The coincidence
appears to me to be most noteworthy. In one of his recent lectures,
Professor Max Müller uses the following eloquent language regarding the
Upanishads <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_31.md): 'Lastly come the
Upanishads; and what is their object? To show the utter uselessness,
nay, the mischievousness of all ritual performances (compare our Gîtâ,
pp. [47](sbe0804.htm#page_47), [48](sbe0804.htm#page_48.md),
[84](sbe0811.htm#page_84) <span id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_32).md); to
condemn every sacrificial act which has for its motive a desire or hope
of reward (comp. Gîtâ, [p. 119](sbe0819.htm#page_119.md) <span
id="fr_34"></span>[4](#fn_33).md); to deny, if not the existence, at least
the exceptional and exalted character of the Devas (comp. Gîtâ, pp.
[76](sbe0809.htm#page_76)-[84](sbe0811.htm#page_84.md) <span
id="fr_35"></span>[5](#fn_34).md); and to teach that there is no hope of
salvation and deliverance except by the individual self recognising the
true and universal self, and finding rest there, where alone rest can be
found <span id="fr_36"></span>[6](#fn_35.md)' (comp. our Gîtâ Translation,
pp. [78](sbe0810.htm#page_78)-[83](sbe0811.htm#page_83).md).

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

The passages to which I have given references in brackets will show,
that Professor Max Müller's words might all be used with strict accuracy
regarding the essential teaching of the Bhagavadgîtâ. We have here,
therefore, another strong circumstance in favour of grouping the Gîtâ
with the Upanishads. One more point is worthy of note. Wherever the Gîtâ
refers to the Vedas in the somewhat disparaging manner I have noted, no
distinction is taken between the portion whi.ch relates to the ritual
and the portion which relates to that higher science, viz. the science
of the soul, which Sanatkumâri speaks of in his famous dialogue with
Nârada <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_36.md). At Gîtâ, chapter II, stanza
45, Ar*g*una is told that the Vedas relate only to the effects of the
three qualities, which effects Ar*g*una is instructed to overcome. At
Gîtâ, chapter VI, stanza 44, Ar*g*una is told that he who has acquired
some little devotion, and then exerts himself for further progress,
rises above the Divine word--the Vedas. And there are also one or two
other passages of the like nature. They all treat the Vedas as concerned
with ritual alone. They make no reference to any portion of the Vedas
dealing with the higher knowledge. If the word Vedânta, at Gîtâ, chapter
XV, stanza 15 (p. 113), signifies, as it seems to signify, this latter
portion of the Vedas, then that is the only allusion to it. But, from
all the passages in the Gîtâ which refer to the Vedas, I am inclined to
draw the inference, that the Upanishads of the Vedas, were composed at a
time not far removed from the time of the composition of the Gîtâ, and
that at that period the Upanishads had not yet risen to the position of
high importance which they afterwards commanded. In the passage referred
to at chapter XV, the word Vedântas probably signifies the Âra*n*yakas,
which may be regarded as marking the beginning of the epoch, which the
composition of the Upanishads brought to its close. And it is to the
close of this epoch, that I would assign the birth of the Gîtâ, which is

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

probably one of the youngest members of the group to which it belongs.

It appears to me, that this conclusion is corroborated by the fact that
a few stanzas in the Gîtâ are identical with some stanzas in some of the
Upanishads. With regard to the epic age of Greece, Mr. E. A. Freeman has
said that, in carrying ourselves back to that age, 'we must cast aside
all the notions with which we are familiar in our own age about property
legal or moral in literary compositions. It is plain that there were
phrases, epithets, whole lines, which were the common property of the
whole epic school of poetry <span id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_37.md).' It
appears to me that we must accept this proposition as equally applicable
to the early days of Sanskrit literature, having regard to the common
passages which we meet with in sundry of the Vedic works, and also
sometimes, I believe, in the different Purâ*n*as. If this view is
correct, then the fact that the Gîtâ contains some stanzas in the very
words which we meet with in some of the Upanishads, indicates, to my
mind, that the conclusion already drawn from other data about the
position of the Gîtâ with regard to the Upanishads, is not by any means
unwarranted, but one to which the facts before us rather seem to point.

And here we may proceed to draw attention to another fact connected with
the relation of the Gîtâ to the Vedas. In stanza 17 of the ninth chapter
of the Gîtâ, only *Rik*, *S*âman, and Ya*g*us are mentioned. The
Atharva-veda is not referred to at all. This omission does certainly
seem a very noteworthy one. For it is in a passage where the Supreme
Being is identifying himself with everything, and where, therefore, the
fourth Veda might fairly be expected to be mentioned. I may add that in
commenting on *S*a<u>n</u>karâkârya's remarks on this passage,
Ânandagiri (and Madhusûdana Sarasvatî also)seems evidently to have been
conscious of the possible force of this omission of the Atharva-veda. He
accordingly says that by force of the word 'and' in the verse in
question, the Atharvâ<u>n</u>girasas, or Atharva-veda must

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

also be included. Are we at liberty to infer from this, that the
Atharva-veda did not exist in the days when the Gîtâ was composed? The
explanation ordinarily given for the omission of that Veda, where such
omission occurs, namely, that it is not of any use in ordinary
sacrificial matters, is one which can scarcely have any force in the
present instance; though it is adequate, perhaps, to explain the words
'those who know the three branches of knowledge,' which occur only a few
lines after the verse now under consideration. The commentators render
no further help than has been already stated. Upon the whole, however,
while I am not yet quite prepared to say, that the priority of the Gîtâ,
even to the recognition of the Atharva-veda as a real Veda, may be
fairly inferred from the passage in question, I think that the passage
is noteworthy as pointing in that direction. But further data in
explanation of the omission referred to must be awaited.

If the conclusions here indicated about the relative positions of the
Gîtâ and certain Vedic works are correct, we can fairly take the second
century B. C. as a terminus before which the Gîtâ must have been
composed. For the Upanishads are mentioned in the Mahâbhâshya of
Patañ*g*ali, which we are probably safe in assigning to the middle of
that century. The epoch of the older Upanishads, therefore, to which
reference has been so frequently made here, may well be placed at some
period prior to the beginning of the second century B. C. The
Atharva-veda is likewise mentioned by Patañ*g*ali <span
id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_38.md), and as 'ninefold,' too, be it remembered;
so that if we are entitled to draw the conclusion which has been
mentioned above from chapter IX, stanza 17, we come to the same period
for the date of the Gîtâ. Another point to note in this connexion is the
reference to the Sâma-veda as the best of the Vedas (see [p.
88](sbe0812.htm#page_88).md). That is a fact which seems to be capable of
yielding some chronological information. For the estimation in which
that Veda has been held appears to have varied at different times. Thus,
in the Aitareya-brâhma*n*a <span id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_39.md), the
glory

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

of the Sâman is declared to be higher than that of the *Rik*, In the
*Kh*ândogya-upanishad <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) the Sâman is
said to be the essence of the *Rik*, which *S*a<u>n</u>kara interprets
by saying that the Sâman is more weighty, In the
Pra*s*na-upanishad <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_41.md), too, the
implication of the passage V, 5 (in which the Sâman is stated as the
guide to the Brahmaloka, while the Ya*g*us is said to guide to the lunar
world, and the *Rik* to the, human world) is to the same effect. And we
may also mention as on the same side the N*ri*si*m*ha Tâpinî-upanishad
and the Vedic passage cited in the commentary of, *S*a<u>n</u>kara on
the closing sentence of the first kha*nd*a of that Upanishad <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_42.md). On the other side, we have the statement
in Manu that the sound of the Sâma-veda is unholy; and the consequent
direction that where the sound of it is heard, the *Rik* and Ya*g*us
should not be recited <span id="fr_44"></span>[4](#fn_43.md). We have also
the passages from some of the Purâ*n*as noted by Dr. Muir in his
excellent work, Original Sanskrit Texts, which point in the same
direction <span id="fr_45"></span>[5](#fn_44.md). And we have further the
direction in the Âpastamba Dharma-sûtra, that the Sâman hymns should not
be recited where the other Vedas are being recited <span
id="fr_46"></span>[6](#fn_45.md), as well as the grouping of the sound of
the Sâman with various classes of objectionable and unholy noises, such
as those of dogs and asses. It is pretty evident that the view of
Âpastamba is based on the same theory as that of Manu. Now in looking at
the two classes of authorities thus marshalled, it is plain that the
Gîtâ ranges itself with those which are unquestionably the more ancient.
And among the less ancient works, prior to which we may place the Gîtâ
on account of the facts now under consideration, are Manu and Âpastamba.
Now Manu's date is not ascertained, though, I believe, he is now
generally considered to belong to about the second or third century B.
C. <span id="fr_47"></span>[7](#fn_46.md) But . I

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Dr. Bühler, in the Preface to his Âpastamba in
the present series, has adduced good reasons for holding that Âpastamba
is prior to the third century B. C. <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_47.md),
and we therefore obtain that as a point of time prior to which the Gîtâ
must have been composed.

The next important item of internal evidence which we have to note, is
the view taken of caste in the Bhagavadgîtâ. Here, again, a comparison
of the doctrine of the Gîtâ with the conception of caste in Manu and
Âpastamba is interesting and instructive. The view of Manu has been
already contrasted by me with the Gîtâ in another place <span
id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_48.md). I do not propose to dwell on that point
here, as the date of Manu is far from being satisfactorily ascertained.
I prefer now to take up Âpastamba only, whose date, as just now stated,
is fairly well fixed by Dr. Bühler. The division of castes, then, is
twice referred to in the Bhagavadgîtâ. In the first passage ([p.
59](sbe0806.htm#page_59).md) it is stated, that the division rests on
differences of qualities and duties; in the second (pp.
[126](sbe0820.htm#page_126), [127](sbe0820.htm#page_127).md) the various
duties are distinctly stated according to the differences of qualities.
Now in the first place, noting as we pass along, that there is nothing
in the Gîtâ to indicate whether caste was hereditary, according to its
view, whereas Âpastamba distinctly states it to be such, let us compare
the second passage of the Gîtâ with the Sûtras of Âpastamba bearing on
the point. The view enunciated in the Gîtâ appears to me plainly to
belong to an earlier age--to an age of considerably less advancement in
social and religious development. In the Gîtâ, for instance, the duties
of a Brâhma*n*a are said to be tranquillity, self-restraint, and so
forth. In Âpastamba, they are the famous six duties, namely, study,
imparting instruction, sacrificing, officiating at others' sacrifices,
making gifts, and receiving gifts; and three others, namely,
inheritance, occupancy, and gleaning ears of corn, which, it may be
remarked en passant, are not stated in Manu. The former seem to my mind
to point

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

to the age when the qualities which in early times gave the Brâhma*n*as
their pre-eminence in Hindu society were still a living reality <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_49.md). It will be noted, too, that there is
nothing in that list of duties which has any necessary or natural
connexion with any privilege as belonging to the caste. The Law lays
down these duties, in the true sense of the word. In Âpastamba, on the
contrary, we see an advance towards the later view on both points. You
have no reference to moral and religious qualities now. You have to do
with ceremonies and acts. You have under the head 'duties not mere
obligations, but rights. For the duty of receiving gifts is a right, and
so is the duty of teaching others and officiating at others' sacrifices;
as we know not merely from the subsequent course of events, but also
from a comparison of the duties of Brâhma*n*as on the one hand, and
Kshatriyas, Vai*s*yas, and *S*ûdras on the other, as laid down by Manu
and Âpastamba themselves. Âpastamba's rules, therefore, appear to belong
to the time when the Brâhma*n*as had long been an established power, and
were assuming to themselves those valuable privileges which they have
always claimed in later times. The rules of the Gîtâ, on the other hand,
point to a time considerably prior to this--to a time when the
Brâhma*n*as were by their moral and intellectual qualities laying the
foundation of that preeminence in Hindu society which afterwards enabled
them to lord it over all castes. These observations mutatis mutandis
apply to the rules regarding. the other castes also. Here again, while
the Gîtâ still insists on the inner qualities, which properly constitute
the military profession, for instance, the rules of Âpastamba indicate
the powerful influence of the Brâhma*n*as <span
id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_50.md). For, as stated before, officiating at
others' sacrifices, instructing others, and receiving presents, are here
expressly prohibited to Kshatriyas as also to Vai*s*yas. The result of
that is, that the Brâhma*n*as become indispensable to the Kshatriyas and
Vai*s*yas, for

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

upon both the duty of study, of offering sacrifices, and making gifts
and presents is inculcated. In his outline of the History of Ancient
Religions, Professor Tiele, speaking of the 'increasing influence of the
Brâhmans,' writes as follows: 'Subject at first to the princes and
nobles, and dependent on them, they began by insinuating themselves into
their favour, and representing it as a religious duty to show protection
and liberality towards them. Meanwhile they endeavoured to make
themselves indispensable to them, gradually acquired the sole right to
conduct public worship, and made themselves masters of instruction <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_51.md)'. And after pointing out the high position
thus achieved by the Brâhmans, and the low position of the Kâ*nd*âlas
and others of the inferior castes, he adds: 'Such a position could not
long be endured; and this serves to explain not only the rise of
Buddhism, but also its rapid diffusion, and the radical revolution which
it brought about <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_52.md).' To proceed,
however, with our comparison of the Gîtâ and Âpastamba. The superiority
distinctly claimed by the latter for the Brâhma*n*a is not quite clearly
brought out in the Gîtâ. 'Holy Brâhma*n*as and devoted royal saints' are
bracketed together at [p. 86](sbe0811.htm#page_86.md); while the Kshatriyas
are declared to have been the channel of communication between the Deity
and mankind as regards the great doctrine of devotion propounded by the
Bhagavadgîtâ. That indicates a position for the Kshatriyas much more
like what the Upanishads disclose <span id="fr_54"></span>[3](#fn_53.md),
than even that which Âpastamba assigns to them. The fact is further
noteworthy, that in the Gîtâ each caste has its own entirely distinct
set of duties. There is no overlapping, so to say. And that is a
circumstance indicating a very early stage in the development of the
institution <span id="fr_55"></span>[4](#fn_54.md). Besides, as already
indicated,

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

the duties laid down by Âpastamba and Manu as common to Kshatriyas and
Vai*s*yas are the very duties which make those castes dependent to a
very great extent on the Brâhma*n*as. Lastly, it is not altogether
unworthy of note, that in the elaborate specification of the best of
every species which we find in chapter X, the Brâhma*n*a is not
mentioned as the best of the castes, there is nothing to indicate the
notion contained in the well-known later verse, 'The Brâhma*n*a is the
head of the castes.' On the contrary, the ruler of men is specified as
the highest among men <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_55.md), indicating,
perhaps, a state of society such as that described at the beginning of
the extract from Professor Tiele's work quoted above.

We come now to another point. What is the position of the Gîtâ in regard
to the great reform of *S*âkya Muni, The question is one of much
interest, having regard particularly to the remarkable coincidences
between Buddhistic doctrines and the doctrines of the Gîtâ to which we
have drawn attention in the foot-notes to our translation. But the
materials for deciding the question are unhappily not forthcoming.
Professor Wilson, indeed, thought that there was an allusion to Buddhism
in the Gîtâ <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_56.md). But his idea was based
on a confusion between the Buddhists and the *K*ârvâkas or
materialists <span id="fr_58"></span>[3](#fn_57.md). Failing that allusion,
we have nothing very tangible but the unsatisfactory 'negative argument'
based on mere non-mention of Buddhism in the Gîtâ. That argument is not
quite satisfactory to my own mind, although, as I have elsewhere pointed
out <span id="fr_59"></span>[4](#fn_58.md), some of the ground occupied by
the Gîtâ is common to it with Buddhism, and although various previous
thinkers Are alluded to directly or indirectly in the Gîtâ. There is,
however, one view of the facts of this question, which appears to me to
corroborate the conclusion deducible by means of the negative argument
here referred to. The

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

main points on which Buddha's protest against Brahmanism rests seem to
be the true authority of the Vedas and the true view of the differences
of caste. On most points of doctrinal speculation, Buddhism is still but
one aspect of the older Brahmanism <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_59.md).
The various coincidences to which we have drawn attention show that, if
there is need to show it. Well now, on both these points, the Gîtâ,
while it does not go the whole length which Buddha goes, itself embodies
a protest against the views current about the time of its composition.
The Gîtâ does not, like Buddhism, absolutely reject the Vedas, but it
shelves them. The Gîtâ does not totally root out caste. It places caste
on a less untenable basis. One of two hypotheses therefore presents
itself as a rational theory of these facts. Either the Gîtâ and Buddhism
were alike the outward manifestation of one and the same spiritual
upheaval which shook to its centre the current religion, the Gîtâ being
the earlier and less thorough-going form of it; or Buddhism having
already begun to tell on Brahmanism, the Gîtâ was an attempt to bolster
it up, so to say, at its least weak points, the weaker ones being
altogether abandoned. I do not accept the latter alternative, because I
cannot see any indication in the Gîtâ of an attempt to compromise with a
powerful attack on the old Hindu system; while the fact that, though
strictly orthodox, the author of the Gîtâ still undermines the
authority, as unwisely venerated, of the Vedic revelation; and the
further fact, that in doing this, he is doing what others also had done
before him or about his time; go, in my opinion, a considerable way
towards fortifying the results of the negative argument already set
forth. To me Buddhism is perfectly intelligible as one outcome of that
play of thought on high spiritual topics, which in its other, and as we
may say, less thorough-going manifestations, we see in the Upanishads
and the Gîtâ <span id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_60.md). But assume that
Buddhism was

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

a protest against Brahmanism prior to its purification and elevation by
the theosophy of the Upanishads, and those remarkable productions of
ancient Indian thought become difficult to account for. Let us compare
our small modem events with those grand old occurrences. Suppose our
ancestors to have been attached to the ceremonial law of the Vedas, as
we are now attached to a lifeless ritualism, the Upanishads and the Gîtâ
might be, in a way, comparable to movements like that of the late Raja
Rammohun Roy. Standing, as far as possible, on the antique ways, they
attempt, as Raja Rammohun attempted in these latter days, to bring into
prominence and to elaborate the higher and nobler aspects of the old
beliefs. Buddhism would be comparable to the further departure from old
traditions which was led by Babu Keshub Chander Sen. The points of
dissent in the olden times were pretty nearly the same as the points of
dissent now. The ultimate motive power also was in both cases
identical--a sense of dissatisfaction in its integrity with what had
come down from old times encrusted with the corruptions of years. In
this view the old system, the philosophy of the Upanishads and the Gîtâ,
and the philosophy of Buddha, constitute a regular intelligible
progression. But suppose the turn events took was different, as is
supposed by the alternative theory indicated above. Suppose Babu
Keshub's movement was chronologically prior, and had begun to tell on
orthodox, society. Is it likely, that then one of the orthodox party
would take up the position which Rammohun Roy took? Would he still rely
on old authorities, but with sundry qualifications, and yet earnestly
assail the current forms of orthodoxy? I do not think so. I think the
true view to be, as already stated, very different. The Upanishads, with
the Gîtâ, and the precepts of Buddha

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

appear to me to be the successive <span id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_61.md)
embodiments of the spiritual thought of the age, as it became more and
more dissatisfied with the system of mere ceremonial then dominant.

There are several other points of much interest in the Bhagavadgîtâ,
such as the reference to the Sâ<u>n</u>khya, and Yoga; the place
assigned to the Mârga*s*îrsha month; the allusion to the doctrines of
materialism; the nearly entire coincidence between a stanza of the Gîtâ
and one in the Manu Sm*ri*ti. But in the present state of our knowledge,
I do not. think that we can extract any historical results from any of
them. Without dwelling on them any further <span
id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_62.md), therefore, I will only state it as my
opinion that the Sâ<u>n</u>khya, and Yoga of the Gîtâ are not identical
with the systems known to us under those names, and that the Manu
Sm*ri*ti has probably borrowed from the Gîtâ the stanza common to the
two works.

We now proceed to a discussion of some of the external evidence touching
the age of the Bhagavadgîtâ. It is, of course, unnecessary to consider
any evidence of a date later than the eighth century A. C., that being
the date generally received, though not on very strong grounds, as the
date of Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya, the celebrated commentator of the
Gîtâ <span id="fr_64"></span>[3](#fn_63.md) For the period prior to that
limit, the first testimony to consider is that of Bâ*n*abha*tt*a, the
author of the Kâdambarî. The date of Bâna is now fairly well settled as
the middle of the seventh century A. C. The doubt which the late Dr.
Bhâu Dâjî had cast upon its correctness <span
id="fr_65"></span>[4](#fn_64.md), by impugning the received date of king
Harshavardhana, appears to me to have been satisfactorily disposed of by
the paper of

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

my friend Professor R. G. Bhâ*nd*ârkar on the *K*âlukya dates <span
id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_65.md). In the Kâdambarî, then, we have testimony
to the existence of the Bhagavadgîtâ in the middle of the seventh
century A. C. For in that work, which, as is well known, abounds with
equivoques, we have a passage which compares the royal palace to the
Mahâbhârata, both being 'Anantagitâkar*n*anânanditanaram <span
id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_66.md),' which, as applied to the royal palace,
means 'in which the people were delighted by hearing innumerable songs;'
and as applied to the Mahâbhârata means 'in which Ar*g*una was delighted
at hearing the Anantagîtâ.' Anantagîtâ is evidently only another name
here for Bhagavadgîtâ. The conclusion deducible from this fact is not
merely that the Gîtâ existed, but that it existed as a recognised
portion of the Bhârata, in the seventh century A. C. Now the Kâdambarî
shows, in numerous passages, in what high esteem the Mahâbhârata was
held in its days. The queen Vilâsavatî used to attend at those readings
and expositions of the Mahâbhârata, which have continued down to our own
times; and it was even then regarded as a sacred work of extremely high
authority, in the same way as it is now. It follows., therefore, that
the Gîtâ must have been several centuries old ill the time of
Bâ*n*abha*tt*a.

Prior in time to Bâna is the Indian Shakespeare, Kâlidâsa, as he is
referred to in Bâ*n*abha*tt*a's Harsha*k*arita <span
id="fr_68"></span>[3](#fn_67.md), and also in a copperplate inscription of
the early part of the seventh century, as a poet who had then already
acquired a high reputation <span id="fr_69"></span>[4](#fn_68.md).
Unfortunately, it is not yet possible to fix exactly the date at which
Kâlidâsa flourished. Still, I think, we have pretty satisfactory
evidence to show that the middle of the fifth century A. C. is the very
latest date to which he can be referred. In a small tract (written by me
in 1873), discussing Professor Weber's theory about the Râmâya*n*a, I
have pointed out <span id="fr_70"></span>[5](#fn_69.md) that the
Pañ*k*atantra

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

quotes from Kâlidâsa a passage which there is good reason to believe
formed part of the Pañ*k*atantra when it was translated for king
Nushirvan of Persia about the beginning of the sixth century A. C. <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70.md) Allowing for the time required to raise
Kâlidâsa to the position of being cited as an authority, and for the
time required for the spread of the fame of an Indian work to Persia in
those early days, I think, that the middle of the fifth century is a
date to which Kâlidâsa cannot well have been subsequent. Now in the
works of Kâlidâsa we have some very remarkable allusions to the
Bhagavadgîtâ. It is not necessary to go through all these allusions. I
will only mention the most remarkable, one from the Raghuva*m*sa, and
one from the Kumârasambhava. In Raghu, canto X, stanza 67, the gods
addressing Vish*n*u say, 'There is nothing for you to acquire which has
not been acquired. The one motive in your birth and work is the good of
the worlds.' The first sentence here reminds one at once of Gîtâ,
chapter III, stanza 22, the coincidence with which in sense as well as
expression is very striking. The second sentence contains the words
'birth and work,' the precise words employed at Gîtâ IV, 9; and the idea
of 'good of the worlds' is identical with the idea expressed in Gîtâ
III, 20-24, the words only in which it is clothed being different.
Couple this passage with the one from Kumârasambhava, canto VI, 67,
where the seven *Ri*shis say to the Himâlaya mountain, 'Well hast thou
been called Vish*n*u in a firmly-fixed form.' The allusion there to the
Gîtâ, chapter X, stanza 25 ([p. 89](sbe0812.htm#page_89).md), is, I venture
to think, unmistakable. The word 'firmly-fixed' is identical in both
passages; the idea is identical, and Mallinâtha refers to the passage in
the Gîtâ as the authority which Kâlidâsa had in view. It follows,
therefore, that the Gîtâ must be prior to Kâlidâsa's time. It may be
added, that Kâlidâsa in his Raghu XV, 67, cites Manu as an authority

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

for the proposition that a king must protect all castes and all orders
or â*s*ramas. Manu, therefore, must have lived considerably earlier than
Kâlidâsa, and the Gîtâ, as we have already argued, must be considerably
earlier, not only than Manu, but also than his predecessor Âpastamba.
The Gîtâ, may, therefore, be safely said to belong to a period several
centuries prior to the fifth century A. C.

The next piece of external evidence is furnished by the Vedânta-sûtras
of Bâdarâya*n*a. In several of those Sûtras, references are made to
certain Sm*ri*tis as authorities for the propositions laid down. Take,
for instance, I, 2, 6, or I, 3, 23, and many others. Now three of these
sûtras are very useful for our present purpose. The first we have to
consider is Sûtra II, 3, 45. The commentators Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya,
Râmânu*g*a, Madhva, and Vallabha <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_71.md) are
unanimous in understanding the passage in Gîtâ, chapter XV, stanza 7
([p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112).md), to be the one there referred to by the
words of the Sûtra, which are, 'And it is said in a Sm*ri*ti.' Now a
glance at the context of the Sûtra will, I think, satisfy us that the
commentators, who are unanimous though representing different and even
conflicting schools of thought, are also quite right. Sûtra 43, in the
elliptical language characteristic of that branch of our literature,
says, 'A part, from the statement of difference, and the reverse also;
some lay down that it is a fisherman or a cheat.' Sûtra 44 runs thus,
'And also from the words of the Mantra.' And then comes Sûtra 45 as set
out above. It is plain, that the Sûtra No. 45 indicates an authority for
something not specified, being regarded as part of some other thing also
not specified. Now the discussion in previous Sûtras has been about the
soul; so we can have little difficulty in accepting the unanimous
interpretation of the commentators, that the proposition here sought to
be made out is that the individual soul is part of the Supreme Soul,
which is the proposition laid down in the Gîtâ in the passage referred
to. The

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

next Sûtra to refer to is IV, 1, 10. I shall not set forth the other
relevant Sûtras here as in the preceding case. I only state that the
three commentators, *S*a<u>n</u>kara, Râmânu*g*a, and Madhva, agree that
the Gîtâ is here referred to, namely, chapter VI, stanza ii seq.
Vallabha, however, I am bound to add, does not agree with this, as he
interprets the Sûtra in question and those which precede and follow as
referring to an entirely different matter. If I may be permitted to say
so, however, I consider his interpretation not so satisfactory as that
of the three other and older commentators. Lastly, we come to Sûtra IV,
2-19. On this, again, all the four commentators are unanimous, and they
say that Gîtâ, chapter VIII, stanza 24 seq. ([p.
80](sbe0810.htm#page_80).md), is the authority referred to. And I think
there can be very little doubt that they are right. These various pieces
of evidence render it, I think, historically certain, that the Gîtâ must
be considerably prior to the Vedânta-sûtras; and that the word
Brahma-sûtras, which occurs at Gîtâ, chapter XIII, stanza 4 ([p.
102](sbe0814.htm#page_102).md), is correctly interpreted by the
commentators as not referring to the Vedânta-sûtras, which are also
called Brahma-sûtras, but to a different subject altogether <span
id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_72.md). When were the Vedânta-sûtras composed?
The question must at once be admitted to be a difficult one; but I think
the following considerations will show that the date of those Sutras
must, at the latest, be considerably earlier than the period which we
have already reached in this part of our investigation. We may take it
as fairly well settled, that Bha*tt*a Kumârila, the celebrated
commentator of the Pûrva Mîmâ*m*sâ school, flourished not later than the
end of the seventh century A. C. <span id="fr_74"></span>[2](#fn_73.md) A
considerable time prior to him must be placed the great commentator on
the Mîmâ*m*sâ-sûtras, namely, *S*abarasyâmin. If we may judge from the
style of his great commentary, he cannot have flourished much later than
Patañ*g*ali, who may now be taken as historically proved to

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

have flourished about 140 B. C. <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_74.md) Now
a considerable time must have intervened between *S*abarasyâmin and
another commentator on the Pûrva Mîmâ*m*sâ, whom *S*abara quotes with
the highly honorific title Bhagavân, the Venerable, namely, Upavarsha.
Upavarsha appears from *S*a<u>n</u>kara's statement to have commented on
the Vedânta-sûtras <span id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_75.md). We have thus a
long catena of works from the seventh century A. C., indicating a pretty
high antiquity for the Vedanta-sûtras, and therefore a higher one for
the Bhagavadgîtâ. The antiquity of the Vedânta-sûtras follows also from
the circumstance, which we have on the testimony of Râmânu*g*a, repeated
by Mâdhavâ*k*ârya, that a commentary on the Sûtras was written by
Baudhâyanâ*k*ârya <span id="fr_77"></span>[3](#fn_76.md), which commentary
Râmânu*g*a says he followed. Baudhâyanâ's date is not accurately
settled. But he appears to be older than Âpastamba, whose date, as
suggested by Dr. Bühler, has already been mentioned <span
id="fr_78"></span>[4](#fn_77.md). The Vedânta-sûtras, then, would appear to
be at least as old as the fourth century B. C.; if the information we
have from Râmânu*g*a may be trusted. A third argument may be mentioned,
bearing on the date of the Vedânta-sûtras. In Sûtra 110 of the third
Pâda of the fourth Adhyâya of Pâ*n*ini's Sûtras, a Pârâ*s*arya is
mentioned as the author of a Bhikshu-sûtra. Who is this Pârâ*s*arya, and
what the Bhikshu-sûtra? Unluckily Patañ*g*ali gives us no information on
this head, nor does the Kâ*s*ikâ V*ri*tti. But a note of Professor
Târânâtha Tarkavâ*k*aspati, of Calcutta, says that Pârâ*s*arya is Vyâsa,
and the Bhikshu-sûtra is the Vedânta-sûtra <span
id="fr_79"></span>[5](#fn_78.md). If this is correct, the Vedânta-sûtras go
very far indeed into antiquity. For Pâ*n*ini can certainly not be
assigned to a later date than the fourth century B. C., while that
learned

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

scholar, Professor Goldstücker, on grounds of considerable strength,
assigned him to a much earlier date <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_79.md).
The question thus comes to this, Is the remark of Professor Târânâtha,
above set out, correct? I find then, from enquiries made of my venerable
and erudite friend Ya*g*ñe*s*var *S*âstrin, the author of the
Âryavidyâsudhâkara, that the note of Târânâtha is based on the works of
Bha*tt*o*g*î Dîkshita, Nâgo*g*î Bha*tt*a, and *G*ñânendra Sarasvatî, who
all give the same interpretation of the Sûtra in question. It is
certainly unfortunate that we have no older authority on this point than
Bha*tt*o*g*î. The interpretation is in itself not improbable. Vyâsa is
certainly by the current tradition <span id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_80.md)
called the author of the Vedânta-sûtras, and also the son of Parâ*s*ara.
Nor is Bhikshu-sûtra a name too far removed in sense from Vedânta-sûtra,
though doubtless the former name is not now in use, at all events as
applied to the Sûtras attributed to Bâdarâya*n*a, and though, it must
also be stated, a Bhikshu-sûtra Bhâshya Vârtika is mentioned eo nomine
by Professor Weber as actually in existence at the present day <span
id="fr_82"></span>[3](#fn_81.md). Taking all things together, therefore, we
may provisionally understand the Bhikshu-sûtra mentioned by Pâ*n*ini to
be identical with the Vedânta-sûtras. But even apart from that
identification, the other testimonies we have adduced prove, I think,
the high antiquity of those Sûtras, and consequently of the
Bhagavadgîtâ.

We have thus examined, at what, considering the importance and
difficulty of the subject, will not; I trust, be regarded as
unreasonable length, some of the principal pieces of internal and
external evidence touching the age of the Bhagavadgîtâ and its position
in Sanskrit literature. Although, as stated at the very outset, the
conclusions we have deduced in the course of that examination are not
all such as at once to secure acceptance, I venture to think that we
have now adequate grounds for saying, that the various .and independent
lines of investigation, which we have pursued, converge to this point,
that the Gîtâ, on numerous and

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

essential topics, ranges itself as a member of the Upanishad group, so
to say; in Sanskrit literature. Its philosophy, its mode of treating its
subject, its style, its language, its versification, its opinions on
sundry subjects of the highest importance, all point to that one
conclusion. We may also, I think, lay it down as more than probable,
that the latest date at which the Gîtâ can have been composed, must be
earlier than the third century B. C., though it is altogether impossible
to say at present how much earlier. This proposition, too, is supported
by the cumulative strength of several independent lines of testimony.

Before closing this Introduction, it is desirable to add a word
concerning the text of the Bhagavadgîtâ. The religious care with which
that text has been preserved is very worthy of note. Schlegel and
Lassen <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_82.md) have both declared it as
their opinion, that we have the text now almost exactly in the condition
in which it was when it left the hands of the author. There are very few
real various readings, and some of the very few that exist are noted by
the commentators. Considering that the Mahâbhârata must have been
tampered with on numerous occasions, this preservation of the Gîtâ is
most interesting. It doubtless indicates that high veneration for it
which is still felt, and has for long been felt, by the Hindus, and
which is embodied in the expression used in the colophons of the MSS.
describing the Gîtâ as the 'Upanishad sung by God <span
id="fr_84"></span>[2](#fn_83.md).' In view of the facts and deductions set
forth in this essay that expression existing as, I believe, it does,
almost universally in Indian MSS. of the Gîtâ, is not altogether devoid
of historical value.

Schlegel draws attention to one other circumstance regarding the text of
the Gîtâ, which is also highly interesting, namely, that the number of
the stanzas is exactly 700.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Schlegel concludes that the author must have
fixed on that number deliberately, in order to prevent, as far as be
could, all subsequent interpolations <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_84.md). This is certainly not unlikely; and if
the aim of the author was such as Schlegel suggests, it has assuredly
been thoroughly successful. In the chapter of the Mahâbhârata
immediately succeeding the eighteenth chapter of the Gîtâ, the extent of
the work in *s*lokas is distinctly stated. The verses in which this is
stated do not exist in the Gau*d*a or Bengal recension, and are
doubtless not genuine. But, nevertheless, they are interesting, and I
shall reproduce them here. 'Ke*s*ava spoke 620 *s*lokas, Ar*g*una
fifty-seven, Sañ*g*aya sixty-seven, and Dh*ri*tarâsh*t*ra one *s*loka;
such is the extent of the Gîtâ.' It is very difficult to account for
these figures. According to them, the total number of verses in the Gîtâ
would be 745, whereas the number in the current MSS., and even in the
Mahâbhârata itself, is, as already stated, only 700 <span
id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_85.md). I cannot suggest any explanation whatever
of this discrepancy.

In conclusion, a few words may be added regarding the general principles
followed in the translation contained in this volume. My aim has been to
make that translation as close and literal a rendering as possible of
the Gîtâ, as interpreted by the commentators Sa<u>n</u>karâ*k*ârya,
*S*rîdharasvâmin, and Madhusûdana Sarasvatî. Reference has also been
frequently made to the commentary of Râmânu*g*â-*k*ârya, and also to
that of Nîlaka*nth*a, which latter forms part of the author's general
commentary on the Mahâbhârata. In some places these commentators differ
among themselves, and then I have made my own choice. The foot-notes are
mainly intended to make clear that which necessarily remains obscure in
a literal translation. Some of the notes, however, also point out the
parallelisms existing between the Gîtâ and other works, principally the
Upanishads and the Buddhistic Dhammapada and Sutta Nipâta. Of the latter

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

\[paragraph continues\] I have not been able to procure the original
Pâlî; I have only used Sir M. C. Swamy's translation. But I may here
note, that there are some verses, especially in the Salla Sutta (see pp.
124-127 of Sir M. C. Swamy's book), the similarity of which, in doctrine
and expression, to some of the verses of the Gîtâ is particularly
striking. The analogies between the Gîtâ and the Upanishads have been
made the basis of certain conclusions in this Introduction. Those
between the Gîtâ and these Buddhistic works are at present, to my mind,
only interesting; I am unable yet to say whether they may legitimately
be made the premises for any historical deductions.

There are two indexes: the first a general index of matters, the second
containing the principal words in the Gîtâ which may prove useful or
interesting for philological, historical, or other kindred purposes.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[20:7](sbe0802.htm#fr_47.md) Professor Tiele
(History of Ancient Religions, p. 127) considers the 'main features' of
Manu to be 'pre-Buddhistic.'

<span id="fn_49"></span>[22:1](sbe0802.htm#fr_50.md) The remarks in the
text will show how little there is in the Gîtâ of that 'Brahmanizing'
which has been shortly noticed on a previous page.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[22:2](sbe0802.htm#fr_51.md) As to the Kshatriyas
the contrast with Manu's rules is even stronger than with Âpastamba's.

Hibbert Lectures, p. 137; Weber's Indian Literature, pp. 288, 289; and
Mr. Rhys Davids' excellent little volume on Buddhism, p. 151; and see
also p. 83 of Mr. Davids' book.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[25:2](sbe0802.htm#fr_61.md) Cf. Weber's History of
Indian Literature, p. 285. in Mr. Davids' Buddhism, p. 94, we have a
noteworthy extract from a standard Buddhistic work, touching <span
id="page_26">p. 26</span> the existence of the soul. Compare that with
the corresponding doctrine in the Gîtâ. It will be found that the two
are at one in rejecting the identity of the soul with the senses &c. The
Gîtâ then goes an to admit a soul separate from these. Buddhism rejects
that also, and sees nothing but the senses.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[27:1](sbe0802.htm#fr_62.md) The word
Brahma-nirvâ*n*a, which occurs so often at the close of chapter V and
also at chapter II, 72, seems to me to indicate that nirvana had not yet
become technically pinned down, so to say, to the meaning which Buddhism
subsequently gave to it, as the name of what it deemed the summum bonum.
Nirvâ*n*a by itself occurs at VI, 15.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[27:2](sbe0802.htm#fr_63.md) See some further
remarks on these points in my Introduction to the Gîtâ in verse.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[27:3](sbe0802.htm#fr_64.md) Professor Tiele

Essays, vol. ii. p. 166, seq. It may be remarked that this argument is
not affected by the attempt to distinguish the Kâlidâsa of the
*S*akuntalâ from the Kâlidâsa of the Raghuva*m*sa. Because the work
cited in the Pañ*k*atantra is the Kumârasambhava, which indisputably
belongs to the same author as the Raghuva*m*sa.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[30:1](sbe0802.htm#fr_72.md) I am indebted to
Professor M. M. Kunte for a loan of Vallabhâ*k*ârya's commentary on the
Sûtras noted in the text. I had not seen it in 1875, when I last
discussed this question.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[34:2](sbe0802.htm#fr_84.md) In the edition of the
Gîtâ published in Bombay in *S*aka 1782, there is a stanza which says
that the Upanishads are the cows, K*ri*sh*n*a the milkman, Ar*g*una the
calf, and the milk is the nectar-like Gîtâ, which indicates the
traditional view of the Gîtâ--a view in consonance with that which we
have been led to by the facts and arguments contained in this
Introduction.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[35:1](sbe0802.htm#fr_85) p. xl (Lassen's ed..md)

<span id="fn_85"></span>[35:2](sbe0802.htm#fr_86.md) *S*a<u>n</u>kara's
commentary states in so many words that the Gîtâ he used contained only
700 *s*lokas.
