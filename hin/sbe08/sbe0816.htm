The great Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is a womb for me, in which I cast the seed. From that, O descendant of Bharata! is the birth of all things. Of the bodies, O son of Kunt&icirc;! which are born from all wombs, the (main) womb is the great Brahman, and I (am) the father, the giver of the seed. Goodness, passion, darkness, these qualities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> born from nature, O you of mighty arms! bind down the inexhaustible soul in the body. Of these, goodness, which, in consequence of being untainted, is enlightening and free from (all) misery, binds the soul, O sinless one! with the bond of pleasure and the bond of knowledge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.

And that, O descendant of Bharata! binds down (the self) with heedlessness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, indolence, and sleep. Goodness unites (the self) with pleasure; passion, O descendant of Bharata! with action; and darkness with heedlessness, after shrouding up knowledge. Passion and darkness being repressed, goodness stands, O descendant of Bharata! Passion and goodness (being repressed), darkness; and likewise darkness and goodness (being repressed), passion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

The fruit of meritorious action is said to be good, untainted; while the fruit of passion is misery; and the fruit of darkness ignorance. From goodness is produced knowledge, from passion avarice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_455"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and from darkness heedlessness and delusion and ignorance also. Those who adhere to (the ways of) goodness go up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_457"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; the passionate remain in the middle; while those of the qualities of darkness, adhering to the ways of the lowest quality, go down.

The embodied (self), who transcends these three qualities, from which bodies are produced&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, attains immortality, being freed from birth and death and old age and misery.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_441"></A><A HREF="sbe0815.htm#fr_442">106:1</A> Not to have true knowledge, is equivalent to self-destruction. Cf. &Icirc;<I>s</I>opanishad, pp. 9, 15, 16.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_442"></A><A HREF="sbe0815.htm#fr_443">106:2</A> I. e. absorbed at the time of the deluge in nature, one of the energies of the supreme; 'emanating,' i.e. at the time of creation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_443"></A><A HREF="sbe0815.htm#fr_444">106:3</A> Nature, which is the material cause from which all entities are produced; the destruction of it results from true knowledge of the soul. See the third note on <A HREF="#page_107">p. 107</A> infra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_444"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_445">107:1</A> I. e. 'are not destroyed,' Madhus&ucirc;dana; 'do not fall,' <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara; are not born,' <I>S</I>r&icirc;dhara, and apparently R&acirc;m&acirc;nu<I>g</I>a.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_445"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_446">107:2</A> I. e. the 'nature' spoken of before.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_446"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_447">107:3</A> These constitute nature. We must understand nature, with Professor Bh&acirc;<I>nd</I>&acirc;rkar, as the hypothetical cause of the soul's feeling itself limited and conditioned. If nature is understood, as it usually is, to mean matter, its being made up of the qualities is inexplicable. Interpreted idealistically, as suggested by Professor Bh&acirc;<I>nd</I>&acirc;rkar, the destruction of it spoken of at the close of the last chapter also becomes intelligible. By means of knowledge of the soul, the unreality of these manifestations is understood and nature is destroyed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_447"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_448">107:4</A> Pleasure and knowledge appertain to the mind, not the self, hence they are described as constituting bonds, when erroneously connected with the self, <I>S</I>a<U>n</U>kara and <I>S</I>r&icirc;dhara. They constitute 'bonds,' because the self when brought into contact with them, strives to obtain them, R&acirc;m&acirc;nu<I>g</I>a.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_448"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_449">108:1</A> Carelessness about duty, owing to being intent on something else. Cf. Sutta Nip&acirc;ta, pp. 51-91; Dhammapada. stanza 21; Ka<I>th</I>opanishad, p. 152.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_449"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_450">108:2</A> The effects of each quality assert themselves, when the other two are held in check.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_450"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_451">108:3</A> I. e. the senses of perception.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_451"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_452">108:4</A> Activity = always doing something or another; performance, &amp;c. = rearing large mansions, &amp;c. want of tranquillity = perpetual agitation of mind, 'this I will do now, then, that, and next the other;' desire = to obtain everything that one comes across.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_452"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_453">108:5</A> I. e. doing absolutely nothing.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_453"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_454">108:6</A> The highest manifestations of Brahman, viz. the Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha, &amp;c., say <I>S</I>r&icirc;dhara and Madhus&ucirc;dana. N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a also suggests that 'those who know the highest' means gods.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_454"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_455">109:1</A> Lower creation, such as birds, beasts, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_455"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_456">109:2</A> Cf. Sutta Nip&acirc;ta, p. 16.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_456"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_457">109:3</A> I. e. are born as gods, &amp;c., middle,' as men, &amp;c.; 'down,' as brutes, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_457"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_458">109:4</A> I. e. what has been called Kshetrag&ntilde;a before, the supervising principle within one.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_458"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_459">109:5</A> Bodies are developments of the qualities, say the commentators, which is not incompatible with the explanation of qualities given above. As to transcending qualities, cf. <A HREF="sbe0804.htm#page_48">p. 48</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_459"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_460">109:6</A> Cf. as to what follows what is said in chapter II about 'one whose mind is steady.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_460"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_461">110:1</A> I. e. who does not feel troubled, for instance, thinking now I am actuated by a motive of passion or darkness, and so forth.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_461"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_462">110:2</A> So as to lose all discrimination.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_462"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_463">110:3</A> I. e. from his determination to pursue truth, by worldly pleasures or pains.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_463"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_464">110:4</A> Cf. <A HREF="sbe0805.htm#page_55">p. 55</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_464"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_465">110:5</A> Intent on the self only.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_465"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_466">110:6</A> For the whole passage, cf. <A HREF="sbe0814.htm#page_101">p. 101</A> supra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_466"></A><A HREF="sbe0816.htm#fr_467">110:7</A> N&icirc;laka<I>nth</I>a interprets this to mean 'the ultimate object of the Vedas.' I here  K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a. <I>S</I>r&icirc;dhara suggests this parallel, as light embodied is the sun, so is the Brahman embodied identical with V&acirc;sudeva.</P>
