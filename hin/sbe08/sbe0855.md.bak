# CHAPTER XXVIII.

Brahman said:

Among men the royal Kshatriya is the middle <span
id="fr_1712"></span>[4](#fn_1705.md) quality; among vehicles the
elephant <span id="fr_1713"></span>[5](#fn_1706.md), and among denizens, of
the forest the lion; among all sacrificial animals the sheep, and among
the dwellers in holes the snake; among cattle also the bull, and among

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

females a male <span id="fr_1714"></span>[1](#fn_1707.md). The Nyagrodha,
the *G*ambu, the Pippala, and likewise the *S*âlmali, the Sin*s*apâ, and
the. Meshas*ri*<u>n</u>ga, and likewise the bamboo and willow <span
id="fr_1715"></span>[2](#fn_1708.md); these are the princes among trees in
this world, there is no doubt of that. The Himavat, the Pâriyâtra, the
Sahya, the Vindhya, the Trikû*t*avat, the *S*veta, the Nîla, the Bhâsa,
and the Kosh*th*avat mountain, the Mahendra, the Guruskandha; and
likewise the Mâlyavat mountain, these are the princes among
mountains <span id="fr_1716"></span>[3](#fn_1709.md). Likewise the Maruts
are (the princes) among the Ga*n*as; the sun is the prince among the
planets, and the moon <span id="fr_1717"></span>[4](#fn_1710.md) among the
Nakshatras; Yama is the prince among the Pit*ri*s, and the ocean among
rivers; Varu*n*a is the king of the waters, and Indra is said to be (the
king) of the Maruts. Arka is the king of hot (bodies), and Indu is said
to be (the king) of shining bodies. Fire is ever the lord of the
elements <span id="fr_1718"></span>[5](#fn_1711.md), and B*ri*haspati of
Brâhma*n*as; Soma is the lord of herbs, Vish*n*u is the chief among the
strong; Tvash*tri* is the prince

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

of the Rudras, and *S*iva is the ruler of (all) creatures; likewise,
sacrifice of (all) initiatory ceremonies <span
id="fr_1719"></span>[1](#fn_1712.md), and Maghavat <span
id="fr_1720"></span>[2](#fn_1713.md) likewise of the gods; the north among
the quarters, and among all vipras the powerful king Soma <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[3](#fn_1714); Kubera (is lord.md) of all jewels,
Purandara of (all) deities. Such is the highest creation among all
entities. Pra*g*âpati (is lord) of all peoples; and of all entities
whatever I, who am full of the Brahman, and great, (am lord). There is
no higher being than myself or Vish*n*u. The great Vish*n*u full of the
Brahman is the king of kings over all. Understand him to be the ruler,
the creator, the uncreated Hari. For he is the ruler of men, Kinnaras,
and Yakshas; of Gandharvas, snakes, and Rakshases; of gods, demons, and
Nâgas. Among all those who are followed by (men) full of desires, (the
chief) is <span id="fr_1722"></span>[4](#fn_1715.md) the great goddess
Mâhe*s*varî, who has beautiful eyes. She is called Pârvatî. Know the
goddess Umâ <span id="fr_1723"></span>[5](#fn_1716.md) to be the best and
(most) holy of (all) females. Among women who are (a source <span
id="fr_1724"></span>[6](#fn_1717) of.md) happiness, likewise, the
brilliant <span id="fr_1725"></span>[7](#fn_1718) Apsarases (are chief.md).
Kings desire

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

piety; and Brâhma*n*as are the bridges <span
id="fr_1726"></span>[1](#fn_1719.md) of piety. Therefore a king should
always endeavour to protect the twice-born <span
id="fr_1727"></span>[2](#fn_1720.md). Those kings in whose dominions good
men lie low, lose all their qualifications <span
id="fr_1728"></span>[3](#fn_1721.md), and go into wrong paths after death.
But those high-souled kings in whose dominions good men are protected,
rejoice in this world, and attain the infinite (seat) after death.
Understand this, O chiefs of the twice-born! I shall now proceed to
state the invariable characteristics of piety. Non-destruction is the
highest piety <span id="fr_1729"></span>[4](#fn_1722.md), and destruction
is of the nature of impiety. Enlightenment <span
id="fr_1730"></span>[5](#fn_1723.md) is the characteristic of gods;
action <span id="fr_1731"></span>[6](#fn_1724.md) the characteristic of
men; sound is the characteristic of space; (the sensation of) touch is
the characteristic of air; colour is the characteristic of light; taste
is the characteristic of water; the characteristic of earth, the
supporter of all beings, is smell; words are the characteristic of
speech <span id="fr_1732"></span>[7](#fn_1725.md) refined into vowels and
consonants; the characteristic of mind is thought. Likewise as to what
is described here as understanding, a determination

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

is here formed by (that) understanding about objects which have been
thought over by the mind <span id="fr_1733"></span>[1](#fn_1726.md). And
there is no doubt of this that determination is the characteristic of
the understanding. The characteristic of mind is meditation <span
id="fr_1734"></span>[2](#fn_1727.md); and the characteristic of a good man
is (living) unperceived <span id="fr_1735"></span>[3](#fn_1728.md). The
characteristic of devotion is action <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[4](#fn_1729.md); and knowledge, the characteristic of
renunciation. Therefore a man of understanding should practice
renunciation, giving prominence to knowledge <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[5](#fn_1730.md). The renouncer possessed of knowledge
attains the highest goal. And crossing beyond darkness, and transcending
death and old age, he repairs to that which has no second <span
id="fr_1738"></span>[6](#fn_1731.md). Thus have I duly spoken to you
concerning the characteristic of piety. I will now proceed to explain
properly the comprehension <span id="fr_1739"></span>[7](#fn_1732.md) of
the qualities. As to the smell of the earth, verily, that is
comprehended by the nose; and the wind <span
id="fr_1740"></span>[8](#fn_1733.md) likewise residing in the nose is a
pointed <span id="fr_1741"></span>[9](#fn_1734.md) to the knowledge of
smell. Taste <span id="fr_1742"></span>[10](#fn_1735.md),

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

the essence of water, is always comprehended by the tongue. And the moon
likewise, who resides in the tongue, is appointed to the knowledge of
taste. The quality of light is colour, and that is comprehended by the
eye; and the sun residing in the eye is appointed always to the
knowledge of colour. The (sensation of) touch, belonging to the air, is
perceived by the skin, and the wind <span
id="fr_1743"></span>[1](#fn_1736.md) residing in the skin is always
appointed to the knowledge of (the objects) of touch. The quality of
space is sound, and that is comprehended by the ear. And all the
quarters residing in the ear are celebrated as (being appointed) to the
knowledge of sound. Thought is the quality of mind, and that is
comprehended by the understanding. The supporter of consciousness <span
id="fr_1744"></span>[2](#fn_1737.md) residing in the heart is appointed to
the knowledge of mind <span id="fr_1745"></span>[3](#fn_1738.md). The
understanding (is comprehended in the form of) determination, and the
Mahat <span id="fr_1746"></span>[4](#fn_1739) of knowledge. To (this.md)
positive comprehension, the unperceived <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[5](#fn_1740) (is appointed.md), there is no doubt of
that. The Kshetra*g*ña, which is in its essence devoid of qualities and
eternal, is not to be comprehended by any

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

symbols. Therefore the characteristic of the Kshetra*g*ña, which is void
of symbols <span id="fr_1748"></span>[1](#fn_1741.md), is purely knowledge.
The unperceived is stated to be the Kshetra <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[2](#fn_1742.md) in which the qualities are produced
and absorbed. And I always see, know, and hear it, (though) concealed.
The Purusha knows it, therefore is he called Kshetra*g*ña <span
id="fr_1750"></span>[3](#fn_1743.md). And the Kshetra*g*ña likewise
perceives all the operations of the qualities <span
id="fr_1751"></span>[4](#fn_1744.md). The qualities created again and
again, do not know themselves <span id="fr_1752"></span>[5](#fn_1745.md),
being nonintelligent, to be created and tied down to a beginning,
middle, and end <span id="fr_1753"></span>[6](#fn_1746.md). Only the
Kshetra*g*ña attains, no one, (else) attains, to the truth, which is
great, transcendent, and beyond the qualities and the entities
(produced) <span id="fr_1754"></span>[7](#fn_1747.md) from the qualities.
Hence a man who understands piety, abandoning qualities, and the
creation <span id="fr_1755"></span>[8](#fn_1748.md), in this world, and
transcending the qualities, and having his sins destroyed, then enters
into the Kshetra*g*ña. One who is free from the pairs of opposites, free
from the ceremony of salutations, and

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

from the svâhâ ceremony <span
id="fr_1756"></span>[1](sbe0856.htm#fn_1749.md), who is unmoving, and
homeless <span id="fr_1757"></span>[2](sbe0856.htm#fn_1750.md), is the
Kshetra*g*ña, he is the Supreme Lord.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1702"></span>[345:1](sbe0854.htm#fr_1709.md) I. e. creating or
acting, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. I think it probable that it was meant to go
with the preceding words. See Gîtâ, [p. 83](sbe0811.htm#page_83.md) note;
but, for this, 'changing' must be in the accusative. It is in the
nominative. As the original stands, and on Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's
interpretation, the sense seems to be that when he is about to engage
fin the work of creation, he can obtain as many bodies as he likes.
Nîlaka*nth*a compares *Kh*ândogya, p. 526. And see pp.
[249](sbe0831.htm#page_249), [327](sbe0850.htm#page_327.md) supra. Can
always perceive = invariably obtains when he wishes.

<span id="fn_1703"></span>[345:2](sbe0854.htm#fr_1710.md) Cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[83](sbe0811.htm#page_83), [93](sbe0813.htm#page_93.md), and note
 [1](sbe0813.htm#fn_388.md) there.

<span id="fn_1704"></span>[345:3](sbe0854.htm#fr_1711.md) Cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[85](sbe0811.htm#page_85), [118](sbe0819.htm#page_118.md).

<span id="fn_1705"></span>[345:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1712.md) I. e.
passion--that quality--is dominant in the Kshatriya, Nîlaka*nth*a. See
[p. 329](sbe0851.htm#page_329.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1706"></span>[345:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1713.md) Commenting on
Gîtâ V, 18 ([p. 65](sbe0807.htm#page_65).md) *S*a<u>n</u>kara calls the
elephant atyantatâmasa, belonging entirely to the quality of darkness.

<span id="fn_1707"></span>[346:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1714.md) As to the
constructions here, cf. generally Gîtâ, [p. 88](sbe0812.htm#page_88.md),
and see the remarks of Râmânu*g*a and *S*rîdhara on Gîtâ X, 21. The
meaning here is, of course, the male is ruler over females.

<span id="fn_1708"></span>[346:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1715.md) I do not know
what distinction is intended between these two. Generally kî*k*aka is
used for the hollow bamboo, which whistles when the wind blows through
it.

<span id="fn_1709"></span>[346:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1716.md) Some of these
mountains are mentioned in Patañ*g*ali. See Introduction.

<span id="fn_1710"></span>[346:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1717.md) This list may be
compared with that at Gîtâ, chapter X. Sometimes the same object occurs
more than once with reference to more than one class; thus the moon
occurs as lord of Nakshatras, of shining bodies, and of herbs--unless
Soma there stands for the Soma plant. See Gîtâ, [p.
113](sbe0817.htm#page_113.md). Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says expressly that the
moon occurs more than once as the correlatives, the classes with
reference to which she is mentioned, are different. In such cases I have
kept the original names untranslated; Arka = sun; Indu = moon.

<span id="fn_1711"></span>[346:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1718.md) Cf. Ka*th*a, p.
83.

<span id="fn_1712"></span>[347:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1719.md) This must mean, I
presume, that the sacrifice is higher than the initiation, as male than
female, see [p. 316](sbe0847.htm#page_316.md), note
 [1](sbe0847.htm#fn_1512.md).

<span id="fn_1713"></span>[347:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1720.md) This is another
repetition. Indra has been mentioned before, and Purandara is mentioned
further on.

<span id="fn_1714"></span>[347:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1721.md) As to king Soma,
see inter alia B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 237; *Kh*ândogya, p. 342, where
*S*a<u>n</u>kara explains 'king' by adding 'of Brâhma*n*as.' Vipras =
Brâhmanas.

<span id="fn_1715"></span>[347:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1722.md) I. e. Mâhe*s*varî
is the most beautiful of womankind.

<span id="fn_1716"></span>[347:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1723.md) It is well known
that Umâ, Pârvatî, Mâhe*s*varî are names of the consort of the third
member of the Hindu Trinity; see Kena, p. 13, and *S*a<u>n</u>kara's
comment there. See, too, Muir, Sanskrit Texts, vol. iv, p. 421, and
Taittirîya-âranyaka, p. 839.

<span id="fn_1717"></span>[347:6](sbe0855.htm#fr_1724.md) The idea of
'source' is supplied by Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1718"></span>[347:7](sbe0855.htm#fr_1725.md) Literally,
'rich.' Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra paraphrases it by '*G*yotishmatî.'
Nîlaka*nth*a's explanation here is not quite clear.

<span id="fn_1719"></span>[348:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1726.md) I. e.
instrumental in piety, or guides to piety. Cf. *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 370;
Mu*nd*aka, p. 297.

<span id="fn_1720"></span>[348:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1727.md) So literally,
doubtless Brâhma*n*as only are intended here.

<span id="fn_1721"></span>[348:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1728.md) I. e., I presume,
they lose all their merits, their good points are destroyed by this
dereliction of duty.

<span id="fn_1722"></span>[348:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1729.md) Cf. [p.
291](sbe0840.htm#page_291.md) supra. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra begins a fresh
chapter with 'I shall now,' &c.

<span id="fn_1723"></span>[348:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1730.md) Knowledge of the
truth, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1724"></span>[348:6](sbe0855.htm#fr_1731.md) I. e. action
performed for the purpose of obtaining the fruit of it. The next five
items refer to the five elements and their characteristic properties.
Nîlaka*nth*a's explanation, that all these are merely parallels not
stated for their own relevancy here, but as illustrations, seems to be
the only available one.

<span id="fn_1725"></span>[348:7](sbe0855.htm#fr_1732.md) I. e. the
learning of other people, Nîlaka*nth*a. The meaning seems to be that we
know speech only in its manifestation in the form of words.

<span id="fn_1726"></span>[349:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1733.md) The text here is
rather unsatisfactory; I have adopted that which I find in the copy
containing Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's commentary.

<span id="fn_1727"></span>[349:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1734.md) Frequent
pondering on matters learnt from *S*âstras or common life, Nîlaka*nth*a.
Why mind comes twice the commentators do not explain.

<span id="fn_1728"></span>[349:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1735.md) Does this refer
to, what is said at Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p. 159](sbe0823.htm#page_159.md).

<span id="fn_1729"></span>[349:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1736.md) Devotion means
here, as in the Gîtâ, action without desire of fruits. For action the
word here is the same as at Gîtâ, [p. 115](sbe0818.htm#page_115.md), note
 [2](sbe0823.htm#fn_644.md).

<span id="fn_1730"></span>[349:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1737.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
52](sbe0804.htm#page_52), note  [7](sbe0805.htm#fn_157.md).

<span id="fn_1731"></span>[349:6](sbe0855.htm#fr_1738.md) This is Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra's interpretation, and appears to me to be correct.
Nîlaka*nth*a's is different, but seems to omit all account of abhyeti,
repairs.'

<span id="fn_1732"></span>[349:7](sbe0855.htm#fr_1739.md) Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra's interpretation seems to be different, but our copy is not
quite intelligible.

<span id="fn_1733"></span>[349:8](sbe0855.htm#fr_1740.md) See [p.
337](sbe0854.htm#page_337.md) supra. The wind is the presiding deity of the
nasal organ.

<span id="fn_1734"></span>[349:9](sbe0855.htm#fr_1741.md) I. e. that is its
function. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says, 'it is pondered on,' which is not
clear.

<span id="fn_1735"></span>[349:10](sbe0855.htm#fr_1742.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
74](sbe0809.htm#page_74.md), as to taste and water.

<span id="fn_1736"></span>[350:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1743.md) This cannot be
the presiding deity here, though one expects such deity to be mentioned;
see [p. 337](sbe0854.htm#page_337.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1737"></span>[350:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1744.md) The text of more
than one of the lines here is rather doubtful; we follow Nîlaka*nth*a,
who takes this to mean the *g*îva, the individual soul. Cf. [p.
239](sbe0829.htm#page_239), note  [2](sbe0829.htm#fn_1095.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1738"></span>[350:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1745.md) I. e. thought, as
Nîlaka*nth*a points out.

<span id="fn_1739"></span>[350:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1746.md) Mahat is properly
the same as buddhi, understanding, but as it is here mentioned
separately, I suppose, it signifies Aha<u>n</u>kâra. Nîlaka*nth*a takes
its operation, here called knowledge, to mean 'the feeling I am,' which
agrees with our interpretation, for which some support is also to be
derived from [p. 333](sbe0852.htm#page_333.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1740"></span>[350:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1747.md) I here follow
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, though somewhat diffidently. The knowledge 'this is
I,' and the knowledge 'this is so and so and nothing else' is presided
over by the unperceived--the Prakriti.

<span id="fn_1741"></span>[351:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1748.md) See
Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p. 146](sbe0821.htm#page_146.md). See also [p.
309](sbe0846.htm#page_309.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1742"></span>[351:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1749.md) See Gîtâ, [p.
102](sbe0814.htm#page_102.md) seq.

<span id="fn_1743"></span>[351:3](sbe0855.htm#fr_1750.md) I. e. he who
knows the Kshetra.

<span id="fn_1744"></span>[351:4](sbe0855.htm#fr_1751.md) Enlightenment,
activity, and delusion, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1745"></span>[351:5](sbe0855.htm#fr_1752.md) I. e. do not know
the self, Nîlaka*nth*a; better, I think, the qualities do not know
themselves, only the Kshetra*g*ña knows them.' Cf. *S*ânti Parvan
(Moksha Dharma), chap. 194, st. 41.

<span id="fn_1746"></span>[351:6](sbe0855.htm#fr_1753.md) I. e. production,
existence, and destruction, Nîlaka*nth*a. This must, however, mean their
manifestation, continuance, and dissolution in any particular form. For
the prak*ri*ti, which is made up of the three qualities, is
beginningless. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 104](sbe0815.htm#page_104.md).

<span id="fn_1747"></span>[351:7](sbe0855.htm#fr_1754.md) I. e. the actual
physical manifestations, as we may say, of the qualities.

<span id="fn_1748"></span>[351:8](sbe0855.htm#fr_1755.md) The original,
sattva, Nîlaka*nth*a renders by buddhi, and qualities by visible
objects. In the familiar Sâ<u>n</u>khya phrase
sattvapurushânyatâpratyaya sattva means creation, or what is other than
purusha (cf. Sâ<u>n</u>khyatattvakaumudî, pp. 9-144). That is the
meaning here. See too [p. 371](sbe0859.htm#page_371.md) infra, and *S*ânti
Parvan (Moksha Dharma), chap. 194, st. 38 seq. and comments there.
