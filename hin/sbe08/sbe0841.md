# CHAPTER XIV.

The Brâhma*n*a said:

On this <span id="fr_1424"></span>[3](#fn_1419.md), too, they relate an old
story, (in the shape of) a dialogue, O you of a pure heart! between
Kârtavîrya and the ocean. (There lived once) a king named Ar*g*una <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[4](#fn_1420.md), a descendant of K*ri*tavîrya,
possessed of a thousand arms, who with his bow conquered the (whole)
earth up to the ocean. Once

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

on a time, as we have heard, he was walking about near the sea, proud of
his strength, and showering hundreds of arrows on the sea. The ocean,
saluting him, and with joined hands, said, 'O brave man! do not throw
arrows (on me). Say, what shall I do for you? The creatures, who take
shelter with me, are being destroyed, O tiger-like king! by the great
arrows thrown by you. Give them security, O Lord!'

Ar*g*una said:

If there is anywhere any wielder of the bow equal to me in battle, who
might stand against me in the field, name him to me.

The ocean said:

If, O king! you have heard of the great sage *G*amadagni, his son is
(the) proper (person) to show you due hospitality <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[1](#fn_1421.md).

Then the king, full of great wrath, went away, and arriving at that
hermitage approached Râma only. In company with his kinsmen, he did many
(acts) disagreeable to Râma, and caused much trouble to the high-souled
Râma. Then the power of Râma, whose power was unbounded, blazed forth,
burning the hosts of the enemy, O lotus-eyed one! And then Râma, taking
up his axe, hacked away that man of the thousand arms in battle, like a
tree of many branches. Seeing him killed and fallen, all (his) kinsmen
assembled together, and taking swords and lances, surrounded the
descendant of Bh*ri*gu. Râma also taking up a bow, and hurriedly
mounting a chariot, shot away volleys of arrows, and blew away the army
of the king. Then some of the

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Kshatriyas, often troubled by fear of the son of
*G*amadagni, entered mountains and inaccessible places, like antelopes
troubled by a lion. And the subjects of those (Kshatriyas) who were not
performing their prescribed duties <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[1](#fn_1422.md) through fear of him, became
V*ri*shalas, owing to the disappearance of Brâhma*n*as <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[2](#fn_1423.md). Thus the Dravi*d*as, Âbhîras,
Pau*nd*ras, together with the *S*âbaras, became V*ri*shalas <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[3](#fn_1424.md), owing to the abandonment of their
duties by Kshatriyas. Then when the heroic (children) of Kshatriya women
were destroyed again and again, the Kshatriyas, who were produced by the
Brâhma*n*as <span id="fr_1430"></span>[4](#fn_1425.md), were also destroyed
by the son of *G*amadagni. At the end of the twenty-first slaughter, a
bodiless voice from heaven, which was heard by all people, spoke sweetly
to Râma, 'O Râma! O Râma! desist (from this slaughter). What good, dear
friend, do you perceive, in taking away the lives of these kinsmen of
Kshatriyas over and over again?' Then, too, his grandfathers <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[5](#fn_1426.md), with *Rik*îka as their head, likewise
said to the high-souled (Râma), 'Desist, O noble one <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[6](#fn_1427.md)!' But Râma, not forgiving his father's

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

murder, said to those sages, 'You ought not to keep me back from this.'

The Pit*ri*s said:

O best of victors! you ought not to destroy these kinsmen of Kshatriyas.
It is not proper for you, being a Brâhma*n*a, to slaughter these kings.

Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 40.

<span id="fn_1418"></span>[293:2](sbe0840.htm#fr_1423.md) The readings here
in the MSS. are not satisfactory. I adopt as the best that which appears
to have been before Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. The meaning seems to be this:--I
have now understood the truth, but I cannot be blamed for having
hitherto done that which I saw every one else do. Now I have had the
benefit of conversation with a good man, and have become free from my
delusion.

<span id="fn_1419"></span>[293:3](sbe0841.htm#fr_1424.md) Namely, that
final emancipation. is not to be obtained by action, and that slaughter
is sinful.

<span id="fn_1420"></span>[293:4](sbe0841.htm#fr_1425.md) He is also called
a Yogin at Raghuva*m*sa VI, 38. See Mallinâth's commentary there.

<span id="fn_1421"></span>[294:1](sbe0841.htm#fr_1426.md) I. e. by giving
him what be desired--a 'foeman worthy of his steel' to fight with him.

<span id="fn_1422"></span>[295:1](sbe0841.htm#fr_1427.md) Viz. the
protection of their subjects.

<span id="fn_1423"></span>[295:2](sbe0841.htm#fr_1428.md) As the kings
failed to protect the people, the Brâhma*n*as apparently were nowhere
forthcoming.

Sanskrit Texts, vol. i, pp. 482 seq., 358, 391; vol. ii, p. 423; *S*ânti
Parvan, ch. 65, st. 13; ch. 207, st. 42 (Râ*g*adharma).

<span id="fn_1425"></span>[295:4](sbe0841.htm#fr_1430.md) As Kshatriyas
were required for the protection of the people, the Brâhma*n*as
procreated them on Kshatriya women. See Muir, Sanskrit Texts, vol. ii,
p. 451 seq. And as they were the offspring of these anomalous connexions
they are described as 'kinsmen of Kshatriyas.\` Cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 317;
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 1037 and comments there. As to heroic, see Muir,
