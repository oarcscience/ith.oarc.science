# CHAPTER IV.

He who becoming placid <span id="fr_1149"></span>[8](#fn_1144.md), and
thinking of nought, may become absorbed in the one receptacle <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[9](#fn_1145), abandoning each previous (element.md),
he will cross beyond

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

(all) bonds. A man who is a friend of all, who endures all, who is
devoted to tranquillity <span id="fr_1151"></span>[1](#fn_1146.md), who has
subdued his senses, and from whom fear and wrath have departed, and who
is self-possessed <span id="fr_1152"></span>[2](#fn_1147.md), is released.
He who moves among all beings as if they were like himself <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[3](#fn_1148.md), who is self-controlled, pure, free
from vanity <span id="fr_1154"></span>[4](#fn_1149.md) and egoism, he is,
indeed, released from everything. And he, too, is released who is
equable towards both life and death <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[5](#fn_1150.md), and likewise pleasure and pain, and
gain and loss, and (what is) agreeable and odious <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[6](#fn_1151.md). He who is not attached to any one,
who contemns no one, who is free from the pairs of opposites, and whose
self is free from affections <span id="fr_1157"></span>[7](#fn_1152.md), he
is, indeed, released in every way. He who has no enemy, who has no
kinsmen, who has no child, who has abandoned piety, wealth, and lust
altogether, and who has no desire, is released. He who is not pious and
not impious <span id="fr_1158"></span>[8](#fn_1153.md), who casts off (the
merit or sin) previously accumulated, whose self is tranquillised by the
exhaustion of the primary elements of the body <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[9](#fn_1154.md), and who is free from the pairs of
opposites, is released. One who does no action <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[10](#fn_1155.md), and who has no desire, looks on this
universe as transient,

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

like an A*s*vattha tree <span id="fr_1161"></span>[1](#fn_1156.md), always
full of birth, death., and old age <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[2](#fn_1157.md). Having his understanding. always
(fixed) upon indifference to worldly objects, searching for his own
faults <span id="fr_1163"></span>[3](#fn_1158.md), he procures the release
of his self from bonds in no long time. Seeing the self void of
smell <span id="fr_1164"></span>[4](#fn_1159.md), void of taste, void of
touch, void of sound, void of belongings, void of colour, and
unknowable, he is released. He who sees the enjoyer of the
qualities <span id="fr_1165"></span>[5](#fn_1160.md), devoid of qualities,
devoid of the qualities of the five elements <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[6](#fn_1161.md), devoid of form, and having no cause,
is released. Abandoning by the understanding <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[7](#fn_1162.md) all fancies bodily and mental <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[8](#fn_1163.md), he gradually obtains
tranquillity <span id="fr_1169"></span>[9](#fn_1164.md), like fire devoid
of fuel. He who is free from all impressions <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[10](#fn_1165.md), free from the pairs of opposites,
without belongings, and who moves among the collection of organs with
penance <span id="fr_1171"></span>[11](#fn_1166.md), he is indeed released.
Then freed from all impressions, he attains to the eternal

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Supreme Brahman, tranquil, unmoving, constant,
indestructible <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1](#fn_1167.md). After this I
shall explain the science of concentration of mind, than which there is
nothing higher, (and which teaches) how devotees concentrating (their
minds) perceive the perfect self <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[2](#fn_1168.md). I will impart instruction regarding
it accurately. Learn from me the paths <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[3](#fn_1169.md) by which one directing the self within
the self perceives the eternal  <span id="fr_1175"></span>[4](#fn_1170.md)
(principle). Restraining the senses, one should fix the mind on the
self; and having first performed rigorous penance <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[5](#fn_1171.md), he should practise concentration of
mind for final emancipation. Then the talented Brâhma*n*a, who has
practised penance, who is constantly practising concentration of mind,
should act on (the precepts of) the science of concentration of
mind <span id="fr_1177"></span>[6](#fn_1172.md), seeing the self in the
self by means of the mind <span id="fr_1178"></span>[7](#fn_1173.md). If
such a good man is able to concentrate the self on the self, then he,
being habituated to exclusive meditation <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[8](#fn_1174.md), perceives the self in the self. Being

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

self-restrained and self-possessed <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[1](#fn_1175.md), and always concentrating his mind,
and having his senses subjugated, he who has achieved proper
concentration of mind <span id="fr_1181"></span>[2](#fn_1176.md) sees the
self in the self, As a person having seen one in a dream, recognises him
(afterwards), saying, 'This is he;' so does one who has achieved proper
concentration of mind perceive the self <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[3](#fn_1177.md). And as one may show the soft fibres,
after extracting them from the Muñ*g*a, so does a devotee see the self
extracted from the body. The body is caned the Muñ*g*a; the soft fibres
stand <span id="fr_1183"></span>[4](#fn_1178.md) for the self. This is the
excellent illustration propounded by those who understand concentration
of mind. When an embodied (self) properly perceives the self
concentrated <span id="fr_1184"></span>[5](#fn_1179.md), then there is no
ruler over him, since he is the lord of the triple world <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[6](#fn_1180.md). He obtains various bodies as he
pleases; and casting aside old age and death, he grieves not and exults
not. The man who

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

has acquired concentration of mind, and who is self-restrained, creates
for himself even the divinity of the gods <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[1](#fn_1181.md); and abandoning the transient body, he
attains to the inexhaustible Brahman. When (all) beings are destroyed,
he has no fear; when (all) beings are afflicted, he is not afflicted by
anything <span id="fr_1187"></span>[2](#fn_1182.md). He whose self is
concentrated, who is free from attachment, and of a tranquil mind, is
not shaken by the fearful effects of attachment and affection <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[3](#fn_1183.md), which consist in pain and grief <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[4](#fn_1184.md). Weapons do not pierce him <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[5](#fn_1185.md); there is, no death for him; nothing
can be seen anywhere in the world happier than he. Properly
concentrating his self, he remains steady to the self; and freed from
old age and grief, he sleeps at ease. Leaving this human frame, he
assumes bodies at pleasure. But one who is practising concentration
should never become despondent <span id="fr_1191"></span>[6](#fn_1186.md).
When one who has properly achieved concentration perceives the self in
the self, then he forthwith ceases to feel any attachment to Indra
himself <span id="fr_1192"></span>[7](#fn_1187.md).

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Now listen how one habituated to exclusive
meditation attains concentration. Thinking <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1](#fn_1188.md) of a quarter seen before, he should
steady his mind within and not out of the city in which he dwells.
Remaining within (that) city, he should place his mind both in its
external and internal (operations) in that habitation in which he
dwells. When, meditating in that habitation, he perceives the perfect
one, his mind should not in anyway wander outside. Restraining the group
of the senses, in a forest <span id="fr_1194"></span>[2](#fn_1189.md) free
from noises and unpeopled, he should meditate on the perfect one within
his body with a mind fixed on one point. He

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

should meditate on his teeth <span id="fr_1195"></span>[1](#fn_1190.md),
palate, tongue, neck, and throat likewise, and also the heart, and
likewise the seat of the. heart. That talented pupil, O destroyer of
Madhu! having been thug instructed by me, proceeded further to
interrogate (me) about the piety (required) for final emancipation,
which is difficult to explain. 'How does this food eaten from time to
time become digested in the stomach? How does it turn to juice, and how
also to blood? And how, too, do the flesh, and marrow, and muscles, and
bones--which all (form) the bodies for embodied (selfs)--develop in a
woman as that (self) develops? How, too, does the strength develop? (And
how is it also) about the removal of non-nutritive (substances) <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[2](#fn_1191.md), and of the excretions, distinctly?
How, too, does he breathe inwards or outwards? And what place does the
self occupy, dwelling in the self <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[3](#fn_1192.md)? And how does the soul moving about
carry the body? And of what colour and of what description (is it when)
he leaves it? O sinless venerable sir! be pleased to state this
accurately to me.' Thus questioned by that Brâhma*n*a, O Mâdhava! I
replied <span id="fr_1198"></span>[4](#fn_1193.md), 'O you of mighty arms!
O

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

restrainer of (your) foes! according to what (I had) heard. As one
placing any property in his store-room should fix his mind on the
property <span id="fr_1199"></span>[1](#fn_1194.md), so placing one's mind
in one's body, and (keeping) the passages confined, one should there
look for the self and avoid heedlessness <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[2](#fn_1195.md). Being thus always assiduous and
pleased in the self, he attains in a short time to that Brahman, after
perceiving which he understands the Pradhâna <span
id="fr_1201"></span>[3](#fn_1196.md). He is not to be grasped by the eye,
nor by any of the senses. Only by the mind (used) as a lamp is the great
self perceived <span id="fr_1202"></span>[4](#fn_1197.md). He has hands and
feet on all sides; he has eyes, heads, and faces on all sides; he has
cars on all sides; he stands pervading everything in the world <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[5](#fn_1198.md). The soul sees the self <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[6](#fn_1199.md) come out from the body; and abandoning
his body, he perceives the self,--holding it to be the immaculate
Brahman,--with, as it were, a mental smile <span
id="fr_1205"></span>[7](#fn_1200.md). And then depending upon it thus, he
attains final emancipation in me <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[8](#fn_1201.md).

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

This whole mystery I have declared to you, O best of Brâhma*n*as <span
id="fr_1207"></span>[1](#fn_1202.md)! I will now take my leave, I will go
away; and do you (too) go away, O Brâhma*n*a! according to your
pleasure.' Thus addressed by me, O K*ri*sh*n*a! that pupil, possessed of
great penance,--that Brâhma*n*a of rigid vows,--went away as he pleased.

Vâsudeva said:

Having spoken to me, O son of P*ri*thâ! these good words relating to the
piety (required) for final emancipation, that best of Brâhma*n*as
disappeared then and there. Have you listened to this, O son of
P*ri*thâ! with a mind (fixed) on (this) one point only <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[2](#fn_1203.md)? For on that occasion, too, sitting in
the chariot you heard this same (instruction). It is my belief, O son of
P*ri*thâ! that this is not easily understood by a man who is confused,
or who has not acquired knowledge with his inmost soul purified <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[3](#fn_1204.md). What I have spoken, O chief of the
descendants of Bharata! is a great mystery (even) among the gods. And it
has never yet been heard by any man in this world, O son of P*ri*thâ!
For, O sinless one! there is no other man than you worthy to hear it.
Nor is it easily to be understood by (one whose) internal self (is)
confused. The world of the gods <span id="fr_1210"></span>[4](#fn_1205.md),
O son of Kuntî! is filled by those who perform

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

actions. And the gods are not pleased with a cessation of the mortal
form <span id="fr_1211"></span>[1](#fn_1206.md). For as to that eternal
Brahman, O son of Prithâ! that is the highest goal, where one, forsaking
the body, reaches immortality and is ever happy. Adopting this doctrine,
even those who are of sinful birth, women, Vai*s*yas, and *S*ûdras
likewise, attain the supreme goal. What then (need be said of)
Brâhma*n*as, O son of P*ri*thâ <span id="fr_1212"></span>[2](#fn_1207.md)!
or well-read Kshatriyas, who are constantly intent on their own duties,
and whose highest goal is the world of the Brahman? This has been stated
with reasons; and also the means for its acquisition; and the fruit of
its full accomplishment, final emancipation, and determination regarding
misery <span id="fr_1213"></span>[3](#fn_1208.md). O chief of the
descendants of Bharata! there can be no other happiness beyond this. The
mortal, O son of Pâ*n*du! who, possessed of talents, full of faith, and
energetic <span id="fr_1214"></span>[4](#fn_1209.md), casts aside as
unsubstantial the (whole) substance of this world <span
id="fr_1215"></span>[5](#fn_1210.md), he forthwith attains the highest goal
by these means. This is all that is to be said, there is nothing further
than this. Concentration of mind comes to him, O son of P*ri*thâ! who
practises concentration of mind constantly throughout six months <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[6](#fn_1211.md).

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[245:1](sbe0830.htm#fr_1142.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra

Prak*ri*ti, or nature.

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[245:6](sbe0830.htm#fr_1147.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
124](sbe0820.htm#page_124.md).

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[245:7](sbe0830.htm#fr_1148.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
111](sbe0817.htm#page_111.md).

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[245:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1149.md) We now begin, as
Nîlaka*nth*a points out, the answer to the question put above by
Kâ*s*yapa about the emancipation of the self. Placid, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
renders to mean 'silent, taciturn.' See [p. 234](sbe0828.htm#page_234.md)
supra.

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[245:9](sbe0831.htm#fr_1150.md) The path of
knowledge, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra; the Brahman, says Nîlaka*nth*a.
Abandoning each element = absorbing the gross into the subtle elements,
and so forth, Nîlaka*nth*a,; abandoning each elementary mode of worship
till one reaches that of contemplating the absolute Brahman, Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[246:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1151.md) This, in the
terminology of the Vedânta, means keeping the mind from everything save
'hearing' &c. about the Brahman.

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[246:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1152.md) One who has his
mind under his control. But see Gîtâ, [p. 63](sbe0806.htm#page_63.md).

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[246:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1153.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
71](sbe0808.htm#page_71.md).

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[246:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1154.md) I. e. the desire
to be honoured or respected, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Cf. Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p.
161](sbe0823.htm#page_161.md).

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[246:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1155.md) Who does not care
when death comes.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[246:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1156.md) Cf. [p.
51](sbe0804.htm#page_51.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[246:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1157.md) Cf. Gîtâ for all
this, pp. [101](sbe0814.htm#page_101), [103](sbe0815.htm#page_103.md),
[125](sbe0820.htm#page_125.md), &c.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[246:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1158.md) Cf. Ka*th*a, p.
101.

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[246:9](sbe0831.htm#fr_1159.md) Nîlaka*nth*a says
this means the constituents of the body. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says, 'Prâ*n*a
or life-wind,' &c. They are seven. See gloss on *Kh*ândogya-upanishad,
p. 441, and [p. 343](sbe0854.htm#page_343.md) infra.

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[246:10](sbe0831.htm#fr_1160.md) Because, says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, he has no desire. Nîlaka*nth*a says this means an
ascetic, sannyâsin. See [p. 257](sbe0832.htm#page_257.md) infra, note
 [1](sbe0832.htm#fn_1217.md).

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[247:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1161.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
111](sbe0817.htm#page_111.md), where *S*a<u>n</u>kara explains the name to
mean 'what will not remain even till to-morrow.'

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[247:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1162.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
109](sbe0816.htm#page_109.md), and other passages.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[247:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1163.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
has a different reading, which means 'particularly observing the evils
of (the three kinds of) misery.'

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[247:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1164.md) Cf. Ka*th*a, p.
119; Mu*nd*aka, pp. 267; and Mândukya, p. 371.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[247:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1165.md) Cf. Gîtâ, pp.
[104](sbe0815.htm#page_104), p. [105](sbe0815.htm#page_105.md), and
Ka*th*a, p. 112.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[247:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1166.md) Nîlakan*th*a says
this refers to the gross elements, the next expression to the subtle
ones, and being free from these two, he is 'devoid of qualities,' viz.
the three qualities.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[247:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1167.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
65](sbe0807.htm#page_65.md).

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[247:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1168.md) I. e. those which
cause bodily and mental activity.

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[247:9](sbe0831.htm#fr_1169.md) Cf. Maitrî, p.
178. The original is the famous word 'Nirvâ*n*a.'

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[247:10](sbe0831.htm#fr_1170.md) Scil. derived
from false knowledge, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Nîlaka*nth*a says all
impressions from outside oneself which are destroyed by those produced
from concentration of mind, &c. See [p. 391](sbe0863.htm#page_391.md)
infra.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[247:11](sbe0831.htm#fr_1171.md) I. e. all those
operations by which the internal man is rendered pure and free from all
taints; see below, [p. 248](#page_248.md), where Nîlaka*nth*a renders it as
'the performance of one's duty which is called penance.' But see, too,
pp. [74](sbe0809.htm#page_74), [119](sbe0819.htm#page_119.md),
[166](sbe0824.htm#page_166.md) supra. The meaning seems to be that the
<span id="page_247">p. 247</span> man in question lets his senses work,
but does not permit himself to be in any way identified with their
operations. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 64](sbe0807.htm#page_64.md).

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[248:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1172.md) Cf. the
expressions at Gîtâ, [p. 45](sbe0804.htm#page_45.md). 'Unmoving,' which
occurs at Î*s*a, p. 10, is there explained by *S*a<u>n</u>kara to mean
'always the same.' The same sense is given by Mahîdhara. Weber's
*S*atapatha, p. 980.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[248:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1173.md) 'Perfect' would
seem to mean here free from all bonds or taints, the absolute.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[248:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1174.md) I. e. sources of
knowledge, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[248:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1175.md) Cf. as to
'directing the self within the self,' Gîtâ, [p.
69](sbe0808.htm#page_69.md). Nîlaka*nth*a says, 'paths, means of mental
restraint; the self, mind; in the self, in the body.'

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[248:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1176.md) See [p.
247](#page_247), note  [11](#fn_1166.md). Nîlaka*nth*a's note there
referred to occurs on this passage. See also [p.
166](sbe0824.htm#page_166), note  [1](sbe0824.htm#fn_737.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[248:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1177.md) It is not easy to
say what this science is. Is it Patañ*g*ali's system that is meant? No
details occur to enable one to identify the 'science.' But, probably, no
system is alluded to.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[248:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1178.md) See note
 [4](#fn_1170.md) above.

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[248:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1179.md) Nîlaka*nth*a has
a very forced explanation of the original word, <span id="page_249">p.
249</span> which also occurs further on; he takes the meaning to be, 'he
who is habituated to that by which the One is attained, viz.
meditation.'

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[249:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1180.md) The original is
the same as at Gîtâ, [p. 63](sbe0806.htm#page_63.md).

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[249:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1181.md) That is to say,
one who has got the power of concentrating his mind as he pleases; and
the words 'always concentrating' &c., just before, would mean 'one who
always exercises that power.'

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[249:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1182.md) I. e. having
perceived the self in the state of concentration, he sees the whole
universe to be the self in this state when the concentration has ceased,
Nîlaka*nth*a. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says, 'having perceived the self at the
time of concentration, he recognises it as the same at the time of
direct perception,' meaning, apparently, the time of final emancipation.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[249:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1183.md) I. e. the
reality, which in this simile forms the substratum of what are called
the fibres; the simile is in the Ka*th*a-upanishad; see, too,
Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p. 176](sbe0825.htm#page_176.md).

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[249:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1184.md) I. e. on the
supreme self, as above explained.

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[249:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1185.md) Cf.
Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p. 161](sbe0823.htm#page_161.md); *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p.
290; and B*ri*hadâranyaka, p. 218; *Kh*ândogya, p. 523; Aitareya, p. 26;
Kaushîtaki, p. 126.

<span id="fn_1181"></span>[250:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1186.md) I do not quite
understand the original. The other reading, dehatvam for devatvam, is
not more intelligible. But comparing the two, the meaning seems to be,
that the divinity of the gods, i. e. their qualities and powers as gods,
are within his reach, if he likes to have them.

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[250:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1187.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
107](sbe0816.htm#page_107.md).

<span id="fn_1183"></span>[250:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1188.md) Affection is the
feeling that a thing is one's own; attachment is the feeling of liking
one has for a thing acquired with difficulty, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[250:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1189.md) Pain appears to
be the feeling immediately following on hurt or evil suffered; grief is
the constant state of mind which is a later result.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[250:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1190.md) Cf. Yoga-sûtra
Bhâshya, p. 208.

<span id="fn_1186"></span>[250:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1191.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
70](sbe0808.htm#page_70.md). Despondency is the feeling that one has not
acquired 'concentration' after much practice, and that therefore the
practice should be abandoned.

<span id="fn_1187"></span>[250:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1192.md) The other reading
here may be rendered, 'Then forthwith Indra himself esteems him highly.'

<span id="fn_1188"></span>[251:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1193.md) This is all
rather mystical. Nîlaka*nth*a takes 'city' to mean body,' and
'habitation' to mean the mûlâdhâra, or other similar mystic centre
within the body, where, according to the Yoga philosophy, the soul is
sometimes to be kept with the life-winds, &c. 'Thinking of a quarter,'
&c., he explains to mean 'meditating on the instruction he has received
after studying the Upanishads.' I do not understand the passage well.
'City' for 'body' is a familiar use of the word. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
65](sbe0807.htm#page_65.md). The original word for habitation occurs at
Aitareya-upanishad, p. 199, where *S*a<u>n</u>kara explains it to mean
'seat.' Three 'seats' are there mentioned,--the organs of sight, &c.;
the mind; and the Âkâ*s*a in the heart. There, too, the body is
described as a 'city,' and Anandagiri explains habitation to mean 'seat
of amusement or sport.' Here, however, the meaning seems to be that one
should work for concentration in the manner indicated, viz. first fix
the mind on the city where one dwells, then on the particular part of it
oftenest seen before, them one's own habitation, then the various parts
of one's body, and finally one's own heart and the Brahman within it.
Thus gradually circumscribed in its operations, the mind is better
fitted for the final concentration on the Brahman. As to external and
internal operations, cf. note  [8](#fn_1163), [p. 247](#page_247.md). The
perfect one is the Brahman. Cf. Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p.
171](sbe0824.htm#page_171.md). As to âvasatha, which we have rendered by
'habitation,' see also Mâ*nd*ukya, p. 340 . By B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p.
751; and the alternative sense suggested by *S*a<u>n</u>kara on the
Aitareya, loc. cit.

<span id="fn_1189"></span>[251:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1194.md) Cf.
Maitrî-upanishad, p. 100.

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[252:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1195.md) Nîlaka*nth*a
cites numerous passages from works of the Yoga philosophy in
illustration of this. He takes 'heart' to mean the Brahman seated in the
heart (cf. *Kh*ândogya, p. 528), and 'the seat of the heart' to mean the
one hundred and one passages of the heart. The latter expression
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra seems to render by 'mind.' See also generally on this
passage, Maitrî-upanishad, p. 133, and Yoga-sûtra III, 1 and 28 seq.,
and commentary there.

<span id="fn_1191"></span>[252:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1196.md) Literally, 'those
which are void of strength.' I adopt Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's reading. The
other reading literally means 'obstructions.'

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[252:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1197.md) The self here
means the body, I take it. See [p. 248](#page_248.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1193"></span>[252:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1198.md) The reply does
not appear here. Nîlaka*nth*a says that the succeeding chapters contain
it. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra seems to say that the answer has been already
given. The context here is obscure.

<span id="fn_1194"></span>[253:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1199.md) Nîlaka*nth*a says
the original means household effects; Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra says wealth, and
adds, the mind is fixed on it from fear of others finding it out.

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[253:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1200.md) Cf.
Sanatsugâtîya, [p. 152](sbe0823.htm#page_152.md). Here, however, the sense
is the ordinary one.

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[253:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1201.md) I. e. all nature,
that from which the universe is developed.

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[253:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1202.md) Cf. Ka*th*a, pp.
117-130. See *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha) CCXL, 16.

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[253:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1203.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
103](sbe0815.htm#page_103.md). The stanza occurs often in the Bhârata.
This, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, answers the question 'how the soul carries
the body.' The soul can do that as it is all-pervading.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[253:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1204.md) The individual
soul, which has acquired true knowledge, perceives the self to be
distinct from the body. See [p. 249](#page_249.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[253:7](sbe0831.htm#fr_1205.md) I. e. at the
false notions which he entertained. Nîlaka*nth*a says, 'smile, i.e.
amazement that he should have been deceived by the mirage-like course of
worldly life.'

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[253:8](sbe0831.htm#fr_1206.md) I. e. final
emancipation and assimilation with the supreme 'depending upon it thus'
= taking refuge with the Brahman in the way above stated.

<span id="fn_1202"></span>[254:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1207.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says, the only questions among those stated above, which are of use for
final emancipation, have been here answered. The others should be looked
for elsewhere.

<span id="fn_1203"></span>[254:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1208.md) The original
words here are identical with those at Gîtâ, [p.
139](sbe0821.htm#page_139.md).

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[254:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1209.md) I adopt
Nîlaka*nth*a's reading here. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra reads 'vi*g*agdhena,'
which he explains to mean 'one who eats kinds of food incompatible with
one another.' A third reading is 'k*ri*taghnena,' ungrateful!

<span id="fn_1205"></span>[254:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1210.md) See Gîtâ [p.
84](sbe0811.htm#page_84.md).

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[255:1](sbe0831.htm#fr_1211.md) Cf.
B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 234, where *S*a<u>n</u>kara quotes the original
stanza, but with a reading which means, 'And the gods are not pleased at
mortals rising above (them).' That is a better reading.

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[255:2](sbe0831.htm#fr_1212.md) See Gîtâ, pp.
[85](sbe0811.htm#page_85), [86](sbe0811.htm#page_86.md), where the words
are nearly identical with those in the text.

<span id="fn_1208"></span>[255:3](sbe0831.htm#fr_1213.md) This is not quite
clear. Does 'determination regarding misery,' the original of which is
du*h*khasya ka vinir*n*aya*h*, mean 'conclusion of all misery?' Comp.
Gîtâ, [p. 79](sbe0810.htm#page_79.md).

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[255:4](sbe0831.htm#fr_1214.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
says this means assiduous.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[255:5](sbe0831.htm#fr_1215.md) I. e. wealth and
so forth, says Nîlaka*nth*a. Cf. 'human wealth' at Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p.
161](sbe0823.htm#page_161.md).

<span id="fn_1211"></span>[255:6](sbe0831.htm#fr_1216.md) Cf.
Maitrî-upanishad, p. 154. The copy of Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's <span
id="page_256">p. 256</span> commentary which I have used, says that the
Anugîtâ ends here. But, as we have shown, there is a verse coming
further on, which *S*a<u>n</u>karâkârya cites as from the Anugîtâ. In
the printed copies of the Mahâbhârata the next chapter is called the
Brâhma*n*agîtâ.
