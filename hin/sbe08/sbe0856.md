# CHAPTER XXIX.

Brahman said:

I will state truly all about that which has a beginning, middle, and
end <span id="fr_1758"></span>[3](#fn_1751), and about the means for its
comprehension, together with names and characteristics <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[4](#fn_1752). It is stated that day was first and
then night; that months have the bright <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[5](#fn_1753) first, the Nakshatras *S*ravana <span
id="fr_1761"></span>[6](#fn_1754) as the first (among them), and the
seasons the winter as the first (among them). The earth is the
source <span id="fr_1762"></span>[7](#fn_1755) of smells, water of
tastes, the light (of) the sun is the source of colours, the wind is
stated to be the source of (the feelings of) touch; likewise space is
the source of sound. These are the qualities of the elements. Now I
shall proceed to state the highest and first of all entities. The sun is

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

the first among shining bodies <span id="fr_1763"></span>[1](#fn_1756);
fire is said to be the first of the elements <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[2](#fn_1757); Sâvitrî <span
id="fr_1765"></span>[3](#fn_1758) of all branches of learning;
Pra*g*âpati of deities; the syllable Om of all the Vedas; and the
Prâ*n*a life-wind, of all words <span id="fr_1766"></span>[4](#fn_1759);
whatever is prescribed in this world, all that is called Sâvitrî <span
id="fr_1767"></span>[5](#fn_1760). The Gâyatrî is the first among
metres; among (sacrificial) animals, the goat <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[6](#fn_1761) is mentioned (as the first). Cows are
the first among quadrupeds, and the twice-born among men <span
id="fr_1769"></span>[7](#fn_1762). The *S*yena is first among birds;
among sacrifices, the offering (into the fire) is the best; and among
all reptiles, O best of the twice-born! the snake <span
id="fr_1770"></span>[8](#fn_1763) is the highest. Of all ages the
K*ri*ta is the first, there is no doubt of that., Among all precious
things, gold (is the first),and among vegetable (products) likewise the
barley seed <span id="fr_1771"></span>[9](#fn_1764). Among all things
to. be eaten or swallowed food is the highest; and of

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

all liquid substances which are to be drunk, water is the best. And
among all immovable entities, without distinction, the Plaksha, the ever
holy field of Brahman <span id="fr_1772"></span>[1](#fn_1765), is stated
to be the first. I, too, (am the first) among all the patriarchs <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[2](#fn_1766), there is no doubt of that. And the
unthinkable, self-existent Vish*n*u is stated to be my own self. Of all
mountains, the great Meru is stated to be the first-born. And among all
quarters and sub-quarters, likewise, the eastern quarter <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[3](#fn_1767) is the first. Likewise the
Ga<u>n</u>gâ going in three paths is stated to be the first-born among
rivers. And likewise of all wells and reservoirs of water, the ocean is
the first-born. And of all gods, Dânavas, Bhûtas, Pi*s*â*k*as, snakes,
and Rakshases, and of men, Kinnaras, and Yakshas, Î*s*vara <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[4](#fn_1768) is the lord. The great Vish*n*u, who
is full of the Brahman, and than whom there is no higher being in these
three worlds, is the source of all the universe. Of all orders <span
id="fr_1776"></span>[5](#fn_1769), that of householders (is the first),
there is no doubt of that. The unperceived is the source of the worlds;
and the same is also the end of everything. Days end with (the sun's)
setting <span id="fr_1777"></span>[6](#fn_1770); the night ends with
(the sun's) rising; the end of pleasure is ever grief;

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

the end of grief ever pleasure. All accumulations end in exhaustion; all
ascents end in falls; all associations end in dissociations; and life
ends in death. All action ends in destruction; death is certain for
whatever is born <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1](sbe0857.htm#fn_1771);
(everything) movable or immovable in this world is ever transient.
Sacrifice, gift, penance, study, observances, and regulations, all this
ends in destruction <span id="fr_1779"></span>[2](sbe0857.htm#fn_1772).
There is no end for knowledge. Therefore one whose self is tranquil,
whose senses are subjugated, who is devoid of (the idea that this or
that is) mine, who is devoid of egoism, is released from all sins by
pure knowledge.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1749"></span>[352:1](sbe0855.htm#fr_1756) See [p.
324](sbe0849.htm#page_324) supra.

<span id="fn_1750"></span>[352:2](sbe0855.htm#fr_1757) See Gîtâ, [p.
101](sbe0814.htm#page_101). Unmoving probably means 'not perturbed by
the qualities' (Gîtâ, [p. 110](sbe0816.htm#page_110)), or perhaps the
same thing as 'of steady mind' at Gîtâ, [p. 101](sbe0814.htm#page_101).
The sense is pretty much the same in both places.

<span id="fn_1751"></span>[352:3](sbe0856.htm#fr_1758) Which has birth
&c., Nîlaka*nth*a, i.e. all the creation, I presume.

<span id="fn_1752"></span>[352:4](sbe0856.htm#fr_1759) The names, that
is to say, of the various elements, and their qualities.

<span id="fn_1753"></span>[352:5](sbe0856.htm#fr_1760) This must mean
fortnights.

<span id="fn_1754"></span>[352:6](sbe0856.htm#fr_1761) This is
specified, says Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, as the six months of the northern
solstice are caused by the sun being at this Nakshatra. As to those six
months, cf. Gîtâ, [p. 81](sbe0810.htm#page_81). For the same reason,
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra adds, the winter season is mentioned as the best.

<span id="fn_1755"></span>[352:7](sbe0856.htm#fr_1762) The word âdi,
literally beginning, is used in the whole of this passage in different
senses; it means the source, it means the best, and it means the first
in order.

<span id="fn_1756"></span>[353:1](sbe0856.htm#fr_1763) This should be
compared with the enumeration at [p. 345](sbe0854.htm#page_345) supra,
and that in the Gîtâ there referred to.

<span id="fn_1757"></span>[353:2](sbe0856.htm#fr_1764) Cf. [p.
346](sbe0855.htm#page_346) supra. Nîlaka*nth*a takes fire to mean the
gastric fire, and bhûta, rendered by us elements, to mean the species of
beings born from eggs and wombs.

<span id="fn_1758"></span>[353:3](sbe0856.htm#fr_1765) The famous verse
'Tat savitur,' &c. See inter alia Brihadâranyaka, p. 999; Âpastamba I,
1, 1, 9; Manu II, 77 seq., 104-170.

<span id="fn_1759"></span>[353:4](sbe0856.htm#fr_1766) See pp.
[264](sbe0833.htm#page_264), [265](sbe0833.htm#page_265) supra.

<span id="fn_1760"></span>[353:5](sbe0856.htm#fr_1767) Here he turns
back to the Sâvitrî, 'looking back in the manner of the lion,' says
Nîlaka*nth*a, and for purposes of upâsanâ. He does not give up the
thread of his discourse entirely, but simply interjects this little
clause. Nîlaka*nth*a adds, Sâvitrî here includes every mode of worship
prescribed for Brâhma*n*as, &c., and even for Mle*kkh*as. Cf. note 3,
and Gautama.(Bühler's ed.), p. 74 note.

<span id="fn_1761"></span>[353:6](sbe0856.htm#fr_1768) Cf. *Kh*ândogya,
p. 109, and *S*a<u>n</u>kara's commentary. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra compares
this text, Tasmâdesha eteshâm pa*s*unâm sresh*th*atamogab. Where it
occurs I know not.

<span id="fn_1762"></span>[353:7](sbe0856.htm#fr_1769) Cf. Sânti Parvan
(Râ*g*adharma), chap. II, st. 11.

<span id="fn_1763"></span>[353:8](sbe0856.htm#fr_1770) I. e. Vâsuki,
Nîlaka*nth*a. More probably it refers to the species.

<span id="fn_1764"></span>[353:9](sbe0856.htm#fr_1771) As it is used in
various ceremonies.

<span id="fn_1765"></span>[354:1](sbe0856.htm#fr_1772) I. e. the
Creator; his field means, I presume his special seat.

<span id="fn_1766"></span>[354:2](sbe0856.htm#fr_1773) Beings from whom
all creatures were born. See inter alia *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha Dharma),
chap. 208, st. 5; Manu I, 34.

<span id="fn_1767"></span>[354:3](sbe0856.htm#fr_1774) At [p.
347](sbe0855.htm#page_347) the north is mentioned. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra has
'ûrdhva,' or upward here, and yet 'north' before. Is the north the best
as the seat of the higher world mentioned at *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha
Dharma), chap. 192, st. 8 seq.?

<span id="fn_1768"></span>[354:4](sbe0856.htm#fr_1775) I. e. Rudra, says
Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1769"></span>[354:5](sbe0856.htm#fr_1776) Viz.
Brahma*k*ârin, householder, forester, and Samnyâsin. Cf. *S*ânti Parvan
(Moksha),ch. 191, st. 10; Manu VI, 89; Gautama, p. 190.

<span id="fn_1770"></span>[354:6](sbe0856.htm#fr_1777) These stanzas
also occur in the *S*ânti Parvan, chap. 27, st. 31 seq. (Râ*g*adharma).
A part of them appears to be quoted in Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sûtra V, 80. And
the commentator Vi*g*ñâna Bhikshu introduces it with the expression 'iti
*s*rûyate.' But it is not a Vedic text.
