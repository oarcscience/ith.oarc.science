# CHAPTER X.

On this, too, they relate an ancient story (showing) of what nature is
the institution of the *K*âturhotra <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[4](#fn_1321.md). The due performance of it in its
entirety is now taught. Hear me, O good woman! state this wonderful

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

mystery. The instrument, the action, the agent, and emancipation <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[1](#fn_1322), these, indeed, O you of a (pure.md)
heart! are the four Hot*ri*s by whom this universe is enveloped. Hear
also the assignment of causes exhaustively <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[2](#fn_1323.md). The nose, and the tongue, and the
eye, and the skin, and the ear as the fifth, mind and understanding,
these seven should be understood to be the causes of (the knowledge
of <span id="fr_1329"></span>[3](#fn_1324).md) qualities. Smell, and taste,
and colour, sound, and touch as the fifth, the object of the mental
operation and the object of the understanding <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[4](#fn_1325.md), these seven are causes of action. He
who smells, he who eats, he who sees, he who speaks, and he who hears as
the fifth, he who thinks, and he who understands, these seven should be
understood to be the causes of the agents <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[5](#fn_1326.md). These <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[6](#fn_1327.md), being possessed of qualities <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[7](#fn_1328.md), enjoy their own qualities, agreeable
and disagreeable. And I am here devoid of qualities. Thus these seven
are the causes of emancipation <span id="fr_1334"></span>[8](#fn_1329.md).
And among the learned who understand (everything), the

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

qualities <span id="fr_1335"></span>[1](#fn_1330.md) which are in the
position of the deities, each in its own place, always enjoy the
offering according to prescribed rules. To him who is not learned,
eating various (kinds of) food, the (feeling of this or that being) mine
adheres. And cooking food for himself, he, through the (feeling of this
or that being) mine, is ruined <span id="fr_1336"></span>[2](#fn_1331.md).
The eating of that which should not be eaten, and drinking of
intoxicating drinks also destroys him. He destroys the food, and
destroying that food he is destroyed in return. The learned man, being
(himself) a ruler, destroying this food again produces it <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[3](#fn_1332.md). And not even a trifling
obstacle <span id="fr_1338"></span>[4](#fn_1333.md) arises to him from that
food. Whatever is thought by the mind <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[5](#fn_1334.md), whatever is spoken by speech,
whatever is heard by the ear, whatever is seen by the eye, whatever is
touched by the sense of touch, and whatever is smelt by the nose,
absorbing all these offerings from all sides, together with those
(senses) which with the mind are six <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[6](#fn_1335.md), my fire <span
id="fr_1341"></span>[7](#fn_1336) of (high.md) qualifications <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[8](#fn_1337.md), shines dwelling within the body. My
sacrifice of concentration of mind is in progress, the performance of
which yields the fire <span id="fr_1343"></span>[9](#fn_1338.md) of
knowledge;

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

the Stotra in which, is the upward life-wind; the *S*astra, the downward
life-wind; and which is very beneficial on account of the abandonment of
everything <span id="fr_1344"></span>[1](#fn_1339.md); the Brahman priest
in which, is the counsellor in all action <span
id="fr_1345"></span>[2](#fn_1340.md); the Hot*ri* priest, the self the
Adhvaryu priest, (the self) whose hymn of praise <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[3](#fn_1341.md) is the offering; the Sastra of the
Pra*s*âst*ri*, truth; and the Dakshi*n*â, final emancipation. On, this,
too, *Rik* verses are recited by the men who understand Nârâya*n*a <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[4](#fn_1342.md)--the god Nârâya*n*a to whom they
formerly offered animal <span id="fr_1348"></span>[5](#fn_1343.md)
(offerings). On that Sâman hymns <span
id="fr_1349"></span>[6](#fn_1344.md), are sung, of which an illustration is
stated <span id="fr_1350"></span>[7](#fn_1345.md).

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

O modest one! understand that god Nârâya*n*a, who is the self of
everything.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1318"></span>[277:1](sbe0836.htm#fr_1323.md) Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra
understands these to be three Savanas.

<span id="fn_1319"></span>[277:2](sbe0836.htm#fr_1324.md) Of taking into
the nâ*d*îs the food digested in the night, this is the morning Savanas;
the afternoon Savana is the kindling of the gastric fire for digesting
new food.

<span id="fn_1320"></span>[277:3](sbe0836.htm#fr_1325.md) The Vâmadevya is
a sûkta beginning 'Kayâ na*s* *k*itrâ' (Rv. IV, 31, 1). The singing of
it is the third Savana, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. And see Taittirîya-âranyaka,
p. 889.

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[277:4](sbe0837.htm#fr_1326.md) Cf.
Aitareya-brâhma*n*a (Haug), pp. 132, 133.

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[278:1](sbe0837.htm#fr_1327.md) Cf. as to the
three first, Gîtâ, [p. 123](sbe0820.htm#page_123.md). They are the four
categories, to one or other of which everything in the world may be
referred.

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[278:2](sbe0837.htm#fr_1328.md) The texts here
differ. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's reading he interprets to mean 'the
subjugation of these Hotris.' The reading followed in the text seems to
some extent to be supported by the sequel. But the passage altogether is
not very clear.

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[278:3](sbe0837.htm#fr_1329.md) So Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra--through these the knowledge of the qualities of objects of
sense is acquired.

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[278:4](sbe0837.htm#fr_1330.md) The sensations,
or perceptions, referred to lead to action.

<span id="fn_1326"></span>[278:5](sbe0837.htm#fr_1331.md) This seems to
mean, that the powers of smelling, &c., when attributed to the self,
make him appear as an agent, as an active principle.

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[278:6](sbe0837.htm#fr_1332.md) I. e. action,
agent, and instrument, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1328"></span>[278:7](sbe0837.htm#fr_1333.md) I. e. the three,
goodness, passion, and darkness.

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[278:8](sbe0837.htm#fr_1334.md) It is these seven
from which the self is to be emancipated. must mean the self, not the
Brâhma*n*a who speaks.

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[279:1](sbe0837.htm#fr_1335.md) I. e., I presume,
the senses. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 50](sbe0804.htm#page_50.md). The learned do. not
suppose their self to have aught to do with them. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
64](sbe0807.htm#page_64.md).

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[279:2](sbe0837.htm#fr_1336.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
53](sbe0805.htm#page_53.md); Manu III, 118.

<span id="fn_1332"></span>[279:3](sbe0837.htm#fr_1337.md) His knowledge
gives him this power. He is not 'destroyed' by the food as the other man
is. Nîlaka*nth*a compares B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 884. See too [p.
260](sbe0832.htm#page_260), note  [1](sbe0832.htm#fn_1239.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1333"></span>[279:4](sbe0837.htm#fr_1338.md) I. e. mischief
owing to the destruction of life necessary for getting food, says
Nîlaka*nth*a quoting B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka, p. 913.

<span id="fn_1334"></span>[279:5](sbe0837.htm#fr_1339.md) This includes the
operation of the understanding also. Nîlaka*nth*a says this verse
explains what the word 'food' means here.

<span id="fn_1335"></span>[279:6](sbe0837.htm#fr_1340.md) For the phrase
cf. Gîtâ, [p. 112](sbe0817.htm#page_112.md).

<span id="fn_1336"></span>[279:7](sbe0837.htm#fr_1341.md) That is to say,
my self, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. See [p. 259](sbe0832.htm#page_259.md), note
 [3](sbe0832.htm#fn_1235.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1337"></span>[279:8](sbe0837.htm#fr_1342.md) As the objects of
sense &c. are all absorbed into it.

<span id="fn_1338"></span>[279:9](sbe0837.htm#fr_1343.md) It is called
'fire,' as it burns up all action. Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
62](sbe0806.htm#page_62.md).

<span id="fn_1339"></span>[280:1](sbe0837.htm#fr_1344.md) Ar*g*una
Mi*s*ra's commentary is not intelligible here, so I follow Nîlaka*nth*a,
but diffidently.

<span id="fn_1340"></span>[280:2](sbe0837.htm#fr_1345.md) I. e. the mind,
say the commentators. 'Mantâ' simply is given among the synonyms of
Aha<u>n</u>kâra at Sâ<u>n</u>khya-sâra, p. 16.

<span id="fn_1341"></span>[280:3](sbe0837.htm#fr_1346.md) I. e. the actions
performed for knowledge of the truth, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1342"></span>[280:4](sbe0837.htm#fr_1347.md) Nîlaka*nth*a
refers to a *Rik* 'Tapa âsîd-g*ri*hapatih,' and also the famous allegory
at the end of the Taittirîya-âra*n*yaka. These are cited, he says, as
authorities for this 'sacrifice (consisting of) concentration of mind.'

<span id="fn_1343"></span>[280:5](sbe0837.htm#fr_1348.md) I. e. the senses,
Nîlaka*nth*a. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra compares the whole passage with the
Purusha Sûkta, which are the *Rik* verses alluded to, according to him.
He refers for further explanations to his own commentary on that sûkta
of the Rig-veda.

<span id="fn_1344"></span>[280:6](sbe0837.htm#fr_1349.md) They sing these
hymns, out of the gratification produced by knowledge of the self, says
Nîlaka*nth*a, and he cites Taittirîya-âra*n*yaka, p. 749. See also
Taittirîya-upanishad, p. 138, and *S*a<u>n</u>kara's commentary there.

<span id="fn_1345"></span>[280:7](sbe0837.htm#fr_1350.md) The readings of
our texts here are not very satisfactory. The illustration is stated,
says Nîlaka*nth*a, whose reading we follow, by the Taittirîyas in the
passage referred to in the last note. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra's reading means
'such as Tâhu *k*âhu,' which would seem to be the words of the Sâman
hymn referred to. But his commentary does not show what the words before
him were. The whole figure as drawn out in this passage is not quite
clear, though the general sense is pretty intelligible. Cf. the
allegories at Aitareya-brâhma*n*a, pp. 132, 133, and at the close of the
Taittirîya-âra*n*yaka.
