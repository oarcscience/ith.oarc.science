# CHAPTER XXXII.

Brahman said:

The ancients who perceived the established (truth) call
renunciation <span id="fr_1900"></span>[1](#fn_1893.md) penance; and the
Brâhma*n*as dwelling in the seat of the Brahman <span
id="fr_1901"></span>[2](#fn_1894.md) understand knowledge to be concerned
with the Brahman <span id="fr_1902"></span>[3](#fn_1895.md). The highest
Brahman is very far off <span id="fr_1903"></span>[3](#fn_1895.md), and
(the attainment of it) depends on Vedic knowledge <span
id="fr_1904"></span>[4](#fn_1896.md); it is free from the pairs of
opposites, devoid of qualities <span id="fr_1905"></span>[5](#fn_1897.md),
everlasting, of unthinkable qualities, and supreme. The men of talent,
who are pure <span id="fr_1906"></span>[6](#fn_1898.md), and whose minds
are refined, transcending passion, and being untainted, perceive that
supreme (principle) by means of knowledge and penance. Those who are
constantly devoted to renunciation <span
id="fr_1907"></span>[7](#fn_1899.md), and understand the Brahman and wish
for the supreme, go to the happy path by penance. Penance <span
id="fr_1908"></span>[8](#fn_1900) is said to be a light; (correct.md)
conduct is the means to piety; knowledge verily should be understood to
be the highest, and renunciation the best penance. He who understands
determinately the self which is unperturbed, which abides in all
entities, and which is the essential

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

element in knowledge, he is laid down <span
id="fr_1909"></span>[1](#fn_1901) (as being able.md) to move everywhere.
The learned man who perceives, association and dissociation, and
likewise unity and diversity <span id="fr_1910"></span>[2](#fn_1902.md), is
released from misery. He who desires nothing, and despises nothing <span
id="fr_1911"></span>[3](#fn_1903.md), becomes eligible, even dwelling in
this world, for assimilation with the Brahman <span
id="fr_1912"></span>[4](#fn_1904.md). He who knows the truth about the
qualities of Pradhâna <span id="fr_1913"></span>[5](#fn_1905.md), and
understands the Pradhâna of all entities <span
id="fr_1914"></span>[6](#fn_1906.md), who is free from (the thought that
this or that is) mine, and free from egoism <span
id="fr_1915"></span>[7](#fn_1907.md), is emancipated, there is no doubt of
that. One who is free from the pairs of opposites, free from the
(ceremonies of) salutation, free from (the ceremony of) svadhâ <span
id="fr_1916"></span>[8](#fn_1908.md), attains to that everlasting
(principle) which is free from the pairs of opposites, and devoid of
qualities, by tranquillity only. Abandoning all action, whether
agreeable or disagreeable, developed from the qualities <span
id="fr_1917"></span>[9](#fn_1909.md), and abandoning both truth and
falsehood <span id="fr_1918"></span>[10](#fn_1910.md), a creature is
emancipated, there is no doubt of that. The great tree of Brahman <span
id="fr_1919"></span>[11](#fn_1911.md) is

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

eternal; a tree which is produced from the unperceived as the seed,
which consists of the understanding as its trunk, whose collection of
boughs is the great egoism, the sprouts within which are the senses, the
great branches of which are the great elements, and the side branches
the objects of sense, which is always possessed of leaves, always
possessed of flowers, in which agreeable and disagreeable fruits are
always produced, and which is fed upon by all creatures. Cutting and
piercing this (tree) <span id="fr_1920"></span>[1](#fn_1912.md) with the
sword of knowledge of the truth, and abandoning the bonds in the shape
of attachment, which cause birth, death, and old age <span
id="fr_1921"></span>[2](#fn_1913.md), a wise man who is free from (the
thought that this or that is) mine, and who is devoid of egoism, is
emancipated, there is no doubt of that. There are these two birds <span
id="fr_1922"></span>[3](#fn_1914), (which are.md) unchanging, and which
should also be known to be unintelligent <span
id="fr_1923"></span>[4](#fn_1915.md). But as to that other who is above
them, he is called intelligent. (When) the inner self, devoid of
knowledge of nature <span id="fr_1924"></span>[5](#fn_1916.md), and (as it
were) non-intelligent <span id="fr_1925"></span>[6](#fn_1917.md),
understands that which is

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

beyond nature, then understanding the Kshetra <span
id="fr_1926"></span>[1](sbe0860.htm#fn_1918.md), and with an understanding
comprehending all, and transcending the qualities <span
id="fr_1927"></span>[2](sbe0860.htm#fn_1919.md) he is released from all
sins.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1893"></span>[369:1](sbe0859.htm#fr_1900.md) Abandoning of
fruit, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 121](sbe0819.htm#page_121.md).

<span id="fn_1894"></span>[369:2](sbe0859.htm#fr_1901.md) Cf. [p.
339](sbe0854.htm#page_339) supra, note  [4](sbe0854.htm#fn_1654.md),
dwelling in = adhering to.

<span id="fn_1895"></span>[369:3](sbe0859.htm#fr_1903.md) See Gîtâ, [p.
104](sbe0815.htm#page_104.md).

<span id="fn_1896"></span>[369:4](sbe0859.htm#fr_1904.md) Cf.
Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p. 158](sbe0823.htm#page_158.md) seq.

<span id="fn_1897"></span>[369:5](sbe0859.htm#fr_1905.md) Viz. the three
famous ones.

<span id="fn_1898"></span>[369:6](sbe0859.htm#fr_1906.md) Pure, refined,
and untainted are not easily distinguished. Probably 'pure' refers to
external cleanliness; untainted, 'to freedom from sin and such taints;
and 'refined' to freedom from error.

<span id="fn_1899"></span>[369:7](sbe0859.htm#fr_1907.md) I. e. who have no
'belongings,--'Ar*g*una 'Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1900"></span>[369:8](sbe0859.htm#fr_1908.md) Action without
desire, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, who adds that it is called a light, as it
leads to knowledge. See too [p. 166](sbe0824.htm#page_166.md), and [p.
247](sbe0831.htm#page_247), note  [11](sbe0831.htm#fn_1166.md), and [p.
340](sbe0854.htm#page_340.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1901"></span>[370:1](sbe0859.htm#fr_1909.md) 'Laid down' is
literally 'wished.'

<span id="fn_1902"></span>[370:2](sbe0859.htm#fr_1910.md) I presume this
means the real fact underlying the appearances of association and so
forth, namely, that there is but one reality, and all appearances of
difference &c. are unreal. Cf. Gîtâ, [p. 124](sbe0820.htm#page_124.md). See
also [p. 313](sbe0847.htm#page_313.md) supra, note
 [1](sbe0847.htm#fn_1495), and [p. 374](sbe0860.htm#page_374.md) infra.

<span id="fn_1903"></span>[370:3](sbe0859.htm#fr_1911.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
65](sbe0807.htm#page_65.md), and see Ka*th*a, p. 155.

<span id="fn_1904"></span>[370:4](sbe0859.htm#fr_1912.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
65](sbe0807.htm#page_65.md).

<span id="fn_1905"></span>[370:5](sbe0859.htm#fr_1913.md) The qualities,
viz. the three, of Pradhâna, i. e. constituting Prak*ri*ti, or nature.

<span id="fn_1906"></span>[370:6](sbe0859.htm#fr_1914.md) See Gîtâ, [p.
106](sbe0815.htm#page_106), and note  [3](sbe0816.htm#fn_443.md) there.

<span id="fn_1907"></span>[370:7](sbe0859.htm#fr_1915.md) For this whole
expression which occurs so frequently, cf. Maitrî, p. 44, and comment
there.

<span id="fn_1908"></span>[370:8](sbe0859.htm#fr_1916.md) See [p.
324](sbe0849.htm#page_324) supra, note  [8](sbe0849.htm#fn_1569.md).

<span id="fn_1909"></span>[370:9](sbe0859.htm#fr_1917.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
48](sbe0804.htm#page_48.md); *S*vetâ*s*vatara, p. 360.

<span id="fn_1910"></span>[370:10](sbe0859.htm#fr_1918.md) I. e., I
presume, what is real and unreal in a worldly view,--the great truth is
not to be 'abandoned.' Cf. Taittirîya, p. 97-99; [p.
191](sbe0826.htm#page_191) supra; *S*ânti Parvan (Moksha.md), chap. 174,
st. 53; Âpastamba II, 9, 21, 13.

<span id="fn_1911"></span>[370:11](sbe0859.htm#fr_1919.md) I. e., says
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, the tree of worldly life produced from the Brahman.
Compare chapter XII supra.

<span id="fn_1912"></span>[371:1](sbe0859.htm#fr_1920.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
111](sbe0817.htm#page_111.md); and Mu*nd*aka, p. 307, and commentary there.

<span id="fn_1913"></span>[371:2](sbe0859.htm#fr_1921.md) So I render the
original, though the sense at first sight appears to be 'which are
caused by birth,' &c.

<span id="fn_1914"></span>[371:3](sbe0859.htm#fr_1922.md) Viz. the
understanding and egoism, which dwell in the 'tree,' Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.
Nîlaka*nth*a says, 'the great and the individual self.'

<span id="fn_1915"></span>[371:4](sbe0859.htm#fr_1923.md) Cf.
Sâ<u>n</u>khya-kârikâ II, and comment of Vâ*k*aspati Mi*s*ra. The self
is not unintelligent; and as the birds are so described, they must stand
for some manifestation of Prak*ri*ti, which understanding and egoism
are. Otherwise 'bird' does stand for 'self.' See [p.
189](sbe0826.htm#page_189.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1916"></span>[371:5](sbe0859.htm#fr_1924.md) The original word
here is sattva, on which see [p. 351](sbe0855.htm#page_351.md) supra.
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra renders it here by Prak*ri*ti.

<span id="fn_1917"></span>[371:6](sbe0859.htm#fr_1925.md) So Nîlaka*nth*a;
'the only intelligent principle,'--Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra. On Nîlaka*nth*a's
interpretation 'inner self' must be the same thing as Bhûtâtman at
Maitrî, p. 41.
