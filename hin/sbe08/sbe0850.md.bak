# CHAPTER XXIII.

Brahman said:

Now I shall proceed to describe the third--the best--quality, beneficial
to all creatures, and unblamable, the duty of the good. joy <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[7](#fn_1577.md), pleasure, nobility, enlightenment and
happiness also, absence of stinginess, absence of fear, contentment,
faith, forgiveness, courage, harmlessness, equability, truth,
straightforwardness, absence of wrath, absence of calumniation,

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

purity, dexterity, valour. He who possesses the piety of concentration
of mind, (holding) knowledge to be vain <span
id="fr_1585"></span>[1](#fn_1578), (good.md) conduct vain, service vain,
and labour vain, he attains the highest in the next world. Devoid of
(the notion that this or that is) mine, devoid of egoism, devoid of
expectations, equable everywhere, not full of desires, (to be) such is
the eternal duty of the good. Confidence, modesty <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[2](#fn_1579.md), forgiveness, liberality, purity,
freedom from laziness, absence of cruelty, freedom from delusion,
compassion to (all) creatures, absence of backbiting, joy, contentment,
joviality, humility, good behaviour, purity in all action for
(acquiring) tranquillity <span id="fr_1587"></span>[3](#fn_1580.md),
righteous feelings, emancipation <span
id="fr_1588"></span>[4](#fn_1581.md), indifference <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[5](#fn_1582.md), life as a Brahma*k*ârin, abandonment
on all hands, freedom from (the notion that this or that is) mine,
freedom from expectations <span id="fr_1590"></span>[6](#fn_1583.md),
unbroken piety <span id="fr_1591"></span>[7](#fn_1584), (holding that.md)
gifts (are) vain, sacrifices vain, learning vain, vows vain, receipt of
gifts vain, piety vain, penance vain. Those talented Brâhma*n*as in this
world, whose conduct is of this description, who adhere to the quality
of goodness, abiding in the seat of the Brahman <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[8](#fn_1585), perceive (everything.md) aright. Getting
rid of all

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

sins, and free from grief, those talented men reach heaven, and create
(various) bodies <span id="fr_1593"></span>[1](#fn_1586.md). The power of
governing, self-restraint, minuteness <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[2](#fn_1587.md), these those high-souled ones make
(for themselves) by (the operations of their own) minds like the gods
dwelling in heaven. They are said to have their currents upwards <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[3](#fn_1588.md), and to be gods, and of the quality of
goodness <span id="fr_1596"></span>[4](#fn_1589.md); and having gone to
heaven they verily change in various ways, by means of nature <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[5](#fn_1590.md). They obtain and divide <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[6](#fn_1591.md) whatever they desire. Thus, O chiefs
of the twice-born! have I described to you the conduct of the quality of
goodness. Understanding this according to rule, one obtains whatever one
desires. The qualities

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

of goodness have been specifically described, and the operation of the
qualities has been accurately stated. The man who always understands
these qualities, enjoys the qualities <span
id="fr_1599"></span>[1](sbe0851.htm#fn_1592.md), but is not attached to the
qualities.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1571"></span>[325:1](sbe0849.htm#fr_1578.md) I. e. who are
always thinking of what they have done and what they have to do, and so
forth. Cf. Gîtâ, pp. [115](sbe0818.htm#page_115.md),
[116](sbe0818.htm#page_116.md).

<span id="fn_1572"></span>[325:2](sbe0849.htm#fr_1579.md) And not that
which is higher than these, viz. final emancipation.

<span id="fn_1573"></span>[325:3](sbe0849.htm#fr_1580.md) See [p.
321](sbe0848.htm#page_321) and note  [5](sbe0848.htm#fn_1548.md) there.

<span id="fn_1574"></span>[325:4](sbe0849.htm#fr_1581.md) Cf. inter alia,
Gîtâ, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48.md).

<span id="fn_1575"></span>[325:5](sbe0849.htm#fr_1582.md) Viz. heaven. Cf.
Gîtâ, [p. 48](sbe0804.htm#page_48.md).

<span id="fn_1576"></span>[325:6](sbe0849.htm#fr_1583.md) I. e. offerings
to the manes.

<span id="fn_1577"></span>[325:7](sbe0850.htm#fr_1584.md) Cf. [p.
300](sbe0842.htm#page_300) supra, and Sânti Parvan (Moksha.md), chap. 194,
st. 34; chap. 214, st. 36, For nobility, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra has
manifestation of joy.

<span id="fn_1578"></span>[326:1](sbe0850.htm#fr_1585.md) Such is
Nîlaka*nth*a's reading, and be takes knowledge to mean mere knowledge
derived from books, &c. Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra has a different reading for
vain, which he interprets to mean 'wish for fruit.'

<span id="fn_1579"></span>[326:2](sbe0850.htm#fr_1586.md) See
Sanatsugâtîya, [p. 162](sbe0823.htm#page_162.md).

<span id="fn_1580"></span>[326:3](sbe0850.htm#fr_1587.md) I. e. pure and
straightforward conduct in the performance of whatever is done for
attaining final emancipation.

<span id="fn_1581"></span>[326:4](sbe0850.htm#fr_1588.md) Of other people
from sorrow, Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra.

<span id="fn_1582"></span>[326:5](sbe0850.htm#fr_1589.md) The state of
being unconcerned, udâsîna, Nîlaka*nth*a.

<span id="fn_1583"></span>[326:6](sbe0850.htm#fr_1590.md) Cf. Gîtâ, [p.
60](sbe0806.htm#page_60.md), inter alia.

<span id="fn_1584"></span>[326:7](sbe0850.htm#fr_1591.md) Arguna Mi*s*ra
understands the original here to mean 'not being under the control of
another.'

<span id="fn_1585"></span>[326:8](sbe0850.htm#fr_1592.md) I. e. the source
of the Vedas, according to Nîlaka*nth*a. The Supreme is called
Brahmayoni, the original word here, at *S*vetâ*s*vatara, <span
id="page_327">p. 327</span> p. 354, where Brahman is rendered to mean
Prak*ri*ti by *S*a<u>n</u>kara. See Sanatsu*g*âtîya, [p.
186](sbe0826.htm#page_186), note  [6](sbe0826.htm#fn_899.md), and
Taittirîya-âra*n*yaka, p. 894. As to the probable sense here, see [p.
339](sbe0854.htm#page_339), note  [2](sbe0854.htm#fn_1652.md) infra.

<span id="fn_1586"></span>[327:1](sbe0850.htm#fr_1593.md) I. e. for
themselves. Cf. [p. 345](sbe0854.htm#page_345.md) infra; Yoga-sûtras, p.
227 and Brihadâra*n*yaka, p. 849.

<span id="fn_1587"></span>[327:2](sbe0850.htm#fr_1594.md) These include,
according to Nîlaka*nth*a, the other qualities of the same class unnamed
here, for which see Yoga-sûtra III, 44 (p. 207). The power of governing,
i. e. producing, destroying, or combining worldly objects as one
pleases; self-restraint, i. e. in the presence of tempting objects;
minuteness = power of becoming as minute as one pleases. The other
qualities are lightness, largeness, and heaviness; power of attracting
everything so as to be near oneself (e. g. touching the moon with the
finger), power of obtaining one's wish.

<span id="fn_1588"></span>[327:3](sbe0850.htm#fr_1595.md) Cf. [p.
321](sbe0848.htm#page_321) supra and note  [5](sbe0848.htm#fn_1548.md).
Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, and Nîlaka*nth*a also, here render it by 'those who go
upwards.' As to which, see Gîtâ, [p. 109](sbe0816.htm#page_109.md).

<span id="fn_1589"></span>[327:4](sbe0850.htm#fr_1596.md) Cf. for this
sense, which is given by Ar*g*una Mi*s*ra, Sâ<u>n</u>khyasâra, p. 19.

<span id="fn_1590"></span>[327:5](sbe0850.htm#fr_1597.md) Nîlaka*nth*a says
this means that they change their minds for purposes of enjoyment by
means of the impression of previous enjoyments. The changes, however,
seem to be those above referred to-minuteness, &c., and the acquisition
of other bodies. As to nature, cf. Gîtâ, pp. [58](sbe0805.htm#page_58.md)
and [112](sbe0817.htm#page_112.md), with the correction made at [p.
318](sbe0848.htm#page_318.md) supra.

<span id="fn_1591"></span>[327:6](sbe0850.htm#fr_1598.md) This is not quite
clear. Does it mean distribute among themselves or others?
